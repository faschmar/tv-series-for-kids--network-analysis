Introduction:
In Albert Banduras Social-Cognitive-Theory children are learning social behavior mostly through observation of others and the social consequences associated with it. These implications are also true when children are observing behavior through a television program[4,6].  The occurrence of gender biases in mass media, especially in television has been well documented throughout different fields of research. Gender stereotypes are widely spread in media in general, and in TV shows for children in particular.
Often male characters outnumber female characters by 2:1. They appear on screen more often, speak more words, ask more questions and have more questions directed towards them compared to female character [5]. 

Study Aim: The aim of this explorative research study was to investigate the occurrence of gender specific properties in popular animated series by analyzing the corresponding transcripts using computational techniques (R Studio, Sentiment.AI, etc.)
