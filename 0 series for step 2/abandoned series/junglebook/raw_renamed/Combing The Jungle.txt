01:59
did you get it back first of all I
02:01
promised Ricky's mother that you'd go
02:03

02:06
of effort and above all a family of
02:08
fleas oh sorry about that do you want me
02:12
to help you scratch so that you get them
02:14

07:12
big hug is that it Maui has something

talking nonsense the bone doesn't even
07:24
belong to him you weren't doing too well
07:26
there and what's all this about a bone
07:30
it was a put-up job master while car was
07:34
hypnotizing me nobly stow the bone with
07:37
his teeth they're in it together I
07:39
couldn't do anything to stop them no one
07:42
steals from Shere Khan they'll pay for
07:45
this well we shouldn't worry about that
07:49
they must be far away by now hey I've
07:52
got a great idea I could maybe make you
07:54
another bone with teeth and what about
07:56

08:02

08:12
surprise for me
08:14
oops be careful of the fleas Baloo we
08:22
ought to tell you something about that
08:24
bone Mowgli's just given me the most
08:27
incredible gift don't say a word I think
08:31
it's a back scratcher the one that madly
08:35
borrowed or three for example give me
08:37
the molting bone right now a molting
08:40
bone you said and how can you use it on
08:43
your own the truth is the bone isn't
08:46
cars either I can see that from the
08:49
width of the bites and the size of the
08:51
fangs I'd say for the love of a bear
08:55
that groans my god that deceitful little
08:59
Mowgli stole it from me that's not true
09:02
I didn't steal anything tabacky was
09:04
going to throw the boat away and I
09:05
thought that you didn't want it anymore
09:07
Louie the boom to party that flea-bitten
09:13
shuttle will get what's coming to him
09:14
but it was still you and Karl who stole
09:18
it they're not going to get away that
09:20
easily
09:21
I'd advise you not to touch a hair of
09:24
Mowgli's head you should leave now
09:33
[Music]
09:40
what am I going to do now my brown fool
09:45
you've broken my phone what's going on
09:51
here
09:52
come on Maui how about if I asked you to
09:55
give me a hand and scratch me here I
09:57
could help you out there if you like but
10:00
you'll have to not move a scale because
10:02
right now I'm a bit on edge
10:06
[Music]
10:10
so great gift it's totally ruined now
10:13
what's this it's fantastic is it for me
10:17
yes I made it before I found the bone do
10:20
you like it really what special fleas
10:24
though let's say that Shere Khan has
10:26
adopted them and now his bone with teeth
10:29
is broken they'll be around for a long
10:31
time
