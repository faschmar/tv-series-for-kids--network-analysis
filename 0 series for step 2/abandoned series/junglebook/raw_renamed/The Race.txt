[Music]

'''[[Bala]]:''' [growling sound]

'''[[Lali]]:'''  [growling sound]

[chuckle]

'''[[Raksha]]:''' The council of wolves is not a place to play! 

'''[[Akela]]:''' So, Have all the matters been discussed?

'''[[Phaona]]:''' No, Akela. I have grievance.

'''Akela:''' Speak on Phaona.

'''Phaona:''' The man-cub should be with his own kind.

'''Mowgli:''' Huh hmmm

'''[[Baloo]]:''' Phaona has always resented Mowgli. He feels that as human he has no place in the pack. 

''''[[Bagheera]]:''' And we have no say in the matter? 

'''Baloo:''' was adopted by the wolves. We have no voice at their council.

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' But Akela! I am with my own kind! I've been brought up a wolf and a wolf I am.

'''Phaona:''' Your teeth are as little stumps compared to a wolf's. You cannot run like a wolf! 

'''Mowgli:''' I can run as fast any wolf! 

'''[[Bala]] and [[Lali]]:''' Huh

'''Baloo:''' No Mowgli! This is not the way to handle things! 

'''Mowgli:''' I say we have a race! 

'''Phaona:''' And the winner decides on your fate? 

'''Mowgli:''' Yes! 

'''Akela:''' Mowgli! You are certain of your course? 

'''Mowgli:''' Hmm

'''Akela:''' Then the race will be run tomorrow over the ancient route of man.

'''[[Tabaqui]]:''' This news earn me a fat deer haunch, from Shere Khan or my name's not WOWCH!! 

'''[[Ikki]]:''' An interesting meeting I thought. Can't wait to spread the news! 

'''Tabaqui:''' Yes, in the meantime, could you help me this spine of yours out of my.

Whoa Whoa Whoa!!

'''Akela:''' Who! 

'''Tabaqui:''' Heh heh. Don’t mind me. Just passing through.

[[Music]] 

'''Baloo:''' Mowgli.

Hah 

'''Baloo:''' Well Mowgli! As you have rashyly decided upon this race, perhaps a few tips might be in order? 

'''Mowgli:''' Ha ha! What do you know about racing? I can get through the jungle quicker than anyone. You've seen me swinging on the vines.

'''Bagheera:''' Mowgli you challenged Phaona to a running race. If you use the vines you'll be disqualified.

[Music]

'''Mowgli:''' I'll have to leave oh Baloo! hmm

'''Baloo:''' Now listen. You cannot use the vines, but Phaona is larger than you. You might make up enough time in the thick undergrowth. 

'''Baloo:''' Wriggling beneath fallen trees, squeezing through narrow spaces.

'''Tabaqui:''' So then, he challenged Phaona to a race.

'''Shere Khan:''' Good. I have not eaten for a while! 

'''Tabaqui:''' They start at the Council Rock, then pass the wolves lair. Through the Cold Lair

'''Shere Khan:''' Yes! The wolf will satisfy my hunger then I can toy with the man-cub.

'''Tabaqui:''' So I was thinking ah, perhaps this, News might be worth say one of the wolf’s legs? 

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' I shall consider it!

'''[[Tabaqui]]:''' And could you help me get rid of this porcupine quill?

[Bells]

'''[[Tabaqui]]:''' Ohh Thanks Shere Khan! 

[Music]

'''[[Lali]]:''' Phaona we know you’re fastest. So please call off the race.

'''[[Phaona]]:''' But it was Mowgli who suggested it. Of course, if he wishes to back out, then that's fine. But he will, of couse forfeit the race.

'''[[Lali]]:''' And he'll have to go to Man's village.

'''[[Phaona]]:''' Hm. Ah. Here comes the loser.

'''[[Akela]]:''' So, I see you are prepared to undertake this race, Mowgli!!

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Yes, Akela.

[Music]

'''[[Phaona]]:''' Say good bye to your friends, Mowgli... Today's the last day you'll see them.

'''[[Akela]]:''' You both know the couse?

'''[[Other Wolves]]:''' [Howl]

'''[[Akela and Lali]]:''' [Howling]

'''[[Baloo]]:''' No, Bagheera. This is between Phaona and Mowgli. We must not interfere.

'''[[Bagheera]]:''' I'm only going to keep an eye on him. Make sure no harm comes to him.

[Music]

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Huh.

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Huh Err. 

'''[[Phaona]]:''' Huh. Aah.

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' huh

 '''[[Phaona]]:''' Huh Aah!!

[Music]

'''[[Phaona]]:''' You'll have to do better than that, man-cub!

[Music]

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Looks like you're a bit tied up at the moment, Phaona.

'''[[Bagheera]]:''' Nice going, Mowgli!

[Music]

'''[[Banderlog #3]]:'''  Well! What have we here?

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Let go of me!

'''[[Banderlog]]:''' [Monkey sound Laugh]

'''[[Banderlog #3]]:''' Aw come on. We just want to play! 

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Well, I don't!

'''[[Phaona]]:''' [Growling Wolf]

[Monkey sound Laugh]

'''[[Phaona]]:''' Looks like I win, Mowgli! 

'''[[Banderlog #3]]:''' Right! Let's see if he bounces.

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' No!

'''[[Bagheera]]:''' Let him go. - Thanks Bagheera!

'''[[Bagheera]]:''' Grrrowr!

'''[[Banderlog #3]]:''' What just happened?

'''[[Tabaqui]]:''' They should have been here by now.

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' It'll be the worse for you if they don’t get here soon, Tabaqui.

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' My patience is wearing thin! 

'''[[Tabaqui]]:''' They're coming! Well, the wolf at any rate. Look! Over there!

[Music]

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' Grrrr

'''[[Phaona]]:''' Aaah

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' Phaona! You're just in time for lunch.

'''[[Phaona]]:''' What's on the menu?

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' You! (roar)

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Shere Khan!

'''[[Phaona]]:''' Shere Khan! Spare me! A greater prize is on its way. The man-cub!

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' I know. And I shall deal with him after I've finished you off! (roar) Grrr 

'''[[Bagheera]]:''' Mowgli run. You can win! Share Khan will deal with Phaona!

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Yes! And I can't let that happen. He may hate me, but he is my kin!

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' Roar

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Shere Khan? Run Phaona! 

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' Wh what just happened? 

'''[[Akela]]:''' It seems Phaona is the winner!

'''[[Phaona]]:''' Yes! And so it is time to claim my prize. Mowgli, you are a wolf no more. Leave the jungle. Go live with your own kind.

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Goodbye Raksha. Goodbye Bala. And you Lali. I'll miss you..

'''[[Baloo]]:''' Tell them what you told me, Bagheera!

'''[[Bagheera]]:''' Mowgli saved you from Shere Khan, Phaona. And this is how you repay him.

'''[[Akela]]:''' What's this, Phaona? 

'''[[Bagheera]]:''' Near the Cold Lair, Shere Khan attacked Phaona. I was there. And if it hadn't been for Mowgli, Phaona would be so much tiger meat.

'''[[Bala and Lali]]:''' Huhx2

'''[[Akela]]:''' Phaona? Does the panther speak truth? 

'''[[Phaona]]:''' Yes.

'''[[Akela]]:''' Your behavior is unbecoming of one of my pack.

'''[[Phaona]]:''' But Akela, I

'''[[Akela]]:''' Silence, Phaona! We shall speak of this again at a later time. As for you Mowgli. You could have left Phaona to his fate and won the race. But you chose to stand and defend one of your own kind. You acted as a true wolf.

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Does this mean..?

'''[[Akela]]:''' Yes, brother.

[chuckle]

'''[[Tabaqui]]:''' Shere Khan? Oh Shere Khan? I was wondering. The wolf haunch you promised me? Have you? Oh? What happened to your head?

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' The same thing that is about to happen to yours! Roar!!

'''[[Tabaqui]]:''' Nooooo!!!!

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' My head!

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' ah Baloo? What are you doing? 

'''[[Baloo]]:''' Just limbering up. I thought you might like to see what racing's really about.

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' What?

'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Hee hee hee. Oh Baloo!}}
