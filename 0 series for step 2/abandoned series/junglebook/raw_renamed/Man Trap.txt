'''[[Shere Khan]]''': ''(growling and sniffing)'' Today I feel lucky, today's the day when finally I will rid myself of that accursed Mowgli.

'''Shere Khan''': ''(Sniffing)'' Unless my noses deceives me, I smell MAN CUB.

''(Leaves rustling)''

'''[[Baloo]]''': As I was saying, the jackal is a creature not to be trusted.

'''[[Mowgli]]''': No of course not.''(yawning)''

'''Baloo''': Take Tabaqui for instance behind that smile lurks a sly and sneaky mind.

''(Mowgli yawning)''

'''Baloo''': Don't let that smile of his fool you... The jackal is a tricky customer.

'''Shere Khan''': Perfect! The man-cub sleeps and that fool of a bear is quite off guard.

'''Baloo''': I well remember the day when Tabaqui tried to fool me. Into thinking there was a hollow tree just full of honey. (Ha ha ha)

(Sneaking Tiger)

'''Baloo''': I didn’t believe him for one moment. You have to be up early in the morning to be up, before...err

'''Bagheera''': Baloo!!

'''Baloo''': ...I mean...It's a fool and his honey.

'''Mowgli''': (Haaa) 

(fall) 

'''Bagheera''': Mowgli! You’ve got to come quickly! (hah)

'''Baloo''': huh err Mowgli? You weren't asleep, I hope?

'''Mowgli''': Me? Asleep? In one of your lessons, Baloo? 

'''Shere Khan''': Hmm! May be not this time.

'''Bagheera''': Baloo...over by...

'''Baloo''': Bagheera, this is no time for interruptions. You know this is the time for Mowgli's lessons.

'''Bagheera''': But, there's a trap!! 

'''Baloo''': What? Trap? Who? Where? I... whoosh? 

'''Mowgli''': Ha-hahahhaa 

'''Baloo''': What trap?? Bagheera, if this is supposed to be a joke.

'''Bagheera''': It's not joke! I found a trap. Near the waterfall. Man's been here. 

'''Shere Khan''':''(listening)'' ''(Hmm)'' By the waterfall, eh? ''(Hm)'' I think this may just provide the opportunity I have been waiting for.

'''Bagheera''': It was well hidden. I almost fell into it! Baloo, we have to make it safe before it catches anyone

'''Baloo''': Cunning fellow, man.  He knows that all the animals of the forest visit the watering hole by the falls. Mowgli! When I said the Jackal was the most devious of creatures..

'''Bagheera''': Baloo! Will you stop wittering! We must act quickly.

'''Baloo''': I was most certainly Not wittering. I was imparting knowledge.

(bird whistle)

'''Shere Khan''':''(sniffing the ground and almost fell into the trap)'' Huh Aagh! A well-hidden trap Indeed.

'''Baloo''': Now then. Where is this trap of yours, Bagheera? 

'''Bagheera''': It was over here...no...over...

'''Shere Khan''':''(Roaring)'' Here! I have waited long for this moment.

[[Baloo]]: You’ll have a little longer to wait if it's Mowgli you're after!

[Music]

'''Shere Khan''': ''(Laughing)'' Come, Come Baloo. You'll have to do better than that.

'''Baloo''': Hold still, you infernal...

'''Mowgli''': No! Baloo!

'''Shere Khan''': Ha ha ha. You can’t help the whelp now Baloo. Man-cub. It's time for you to...

'''Bagheera''': Run Mowgli

'''Shere Khan''': Out of my way! 

''(Bagheera and Shere Khan fighting)''

'''Shere Khan''': You won't escape me! 

'''Mowgli''': Try me! 

''(Shere Khan Roaring)''

'''Mowgli''': ''(throwing sticks)'' You're getting a bit slow, Shere Khan! 

'''Shere Khan''': ''(Roaring)''  Come back here! I haven't finished with you! 

'''Mowgli''': You have for now! 

'''Shere Khan''': Come come, Shere Khan. Use your brain the man-cub might run, but not forever. He'll be back to help his friend out of the trap and next time, he won't be so lucky.

'''Bagheera''': Baloo? Are you all right? 

'''Baloo''': As well as can be expected under the circumstances. Is Mowgli...is he.. 

'''Bagheera''': He’s back.

'''Baloo''': Mowgli! 

'''Bagheera''': No. Shere Khan! 

'''Baloo:''' Go Bagheera! Go and find Mowgli and keep him safe! 

'''Shere Khan''': Ah Baloo quite comfortable down there. No.... well, I expect your friend the man cub... will come back to help you out soon.. and when he does.. ''(Showing his claws)''

'''Baloo''': Huh

[Music]

''(Kaa hissing)''

'''Mowgli''': ''(he and Kaa falls)'' Whoa! I'm sorry Kaa

'''Kaa''': ''(hissed)'' Do I look like a vine? 

'''Mowgli''': No. Of course not. You look like a snake. A very handsome snake.

'''Kaa''': ''(hiss)'' Hmm. It's lucky for you, I’ve eaten this week, Man-cub.

'''Mowgli''': Kaa? Baloo's in trouble. He’s fallen into a trap.  A mantrap. And Shere Khan...

'''Kaa''': What's that treacherous tiger, got to do with it? 

'''Mowgli''': He tricked Baloo into falling into the trap.

'''Kaa''': Did he?? Sounds like the sort of thing he'd do.

'''Mowgli''': And I've got to get him out. Kaa. Can you help me? 

'''Kaa''': Hmmm. I have no love of Shere Khan. Nor man for that matter.''(Jump slide)''I shall see what I can do.

'''Mowgli''':(huh) Thank you Kaa.

'''Shere Khan''': ''(tired)'' Come on, man-cub. Your friend needs your help.

'''Baloo''': ''(small rock thrown)'' There's more where that came from, Shere Khan! 

'''Shere Khan''': I would save your energy, Baloo.Man will be along soon to skin you and roast your meat.

'''Bagheera''': The sirty, rotten, cowardly...AGH! 

'''Mowgli''': Sshhh!! He'll hear you! Kaa says he's going to help us.

'''Bagheera''': How? 

'''Mowgli''': Er...I'm not sure. But he can't do anything, while Shere Khan's waiting by the trap. We've got to get him away from it.

'''Bagheera''': Good idea. How? 

'''Mowgli''': Well, we could...erm..we could...(Not noticing the glasses are getting hot)Have you got any ideas? 

'''Bagheera''': Not just at the moment. Ouch!! 

'''Mowgli''': Ssssh! Bagheera! 

'''Bagheera''': Oh, Oh My tail! It's burning! 

(Blow)

'''Mowgli''': So, it is... look... It's Baloo's eyeglasses. They must have concentrated the sun's reys on you.

'''Bagheera''': Oh, it Burns...

'''Mowgli''':''(thinking?)'' I think...Bagheera, what is Shere Khan most frightened of? 

'''Bagheera''': Man! 

'''Mowgli''': Even more than man. 

'''Bagheera''': Fire

'''Mowgli''': Exactly! Fire! 

'''Kaa''': It’s at times like these that I could really do with a set of legs Or two. 

(wissd)

'''Mowgli''': Don’t worry, Bagheera. It won't hurt you.

'''Bagheera''': I'm not so sure. Careful Mowgli!

'''Shere Khan''': I'd have thought your little fur-less friend might have been here by now, Baloo''(SNIFFING)''Hmm. That smell. it smells like...

'''Mowgli''': Fire!

[Music]

'''Shere Khan''':''(Roar)'' I'll have you man-cub. In spite of the fire. I'll have you. ''(Torch in front of him)'' No! No Keep away from me!!

'''Mowgli''': Not so brave now, eh Shere Khan! Go on! Run! 

'''Shere Khan''': Put it down! Put it down and I'll spare you!

'''Mowgli''': You expect me to believe that! 

'''Kaa''': Baloo? Mowgli said I might find you here.

'''Baloo''': Kaa? Is that you? 


'''Kaa''':''(hsss)'' It is indeed. Now, if you grab hold of my tail...

[Music]

[Applause]
[Music]
'''Kaa''': You're stretching me! 

'''Mowgli''': Keep back Shere Khan! Or I'll roast you! (After putting his torch in water) Uh-no.

'''Shere Khan''': (huh) Hahaha (Roar) And in the end, man-cub, I win. (noticing Baloo) What? But how.

'''Baloo''': Let's just say I had a little help from a friend. Shall we? And now, Shere Khan, I think it's time for you to go.

'''Bagheera''': Two against one? It's just not fair, is it?

'''Shere Khan''': You've been lucky this time, Man-cub. But you can't be lucky every day of your life. ''(the tiger growls)''

'''Mowgli''': ''(huw)'' Thanks Baloo. You too Bagheera. Here you might have found it easier to get out of the trap.. with these on your nose.

'''Baloo''': Thank you! Mowgli! And now I think we'd better fill this hole.. before any other unsuspecting creature falls into it.

'''Baloo''': ''(Aah)'' We would be lost without your help.

'''Kaa''': Well...I won’t be doing it again in a hurry. Given me a spot of back trouble. And when your back's as long as mine.
