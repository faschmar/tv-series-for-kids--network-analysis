'''[[Mowgli]]:''' Whoa! Ugh! Euch!

'''[[Baloo]]:''' Yes, I know it doesn't smell too good.

'''[[Bagheera]]:''' Good?! It smells like something that son of a jackal Tabaqui might have dropped after feeding on stink bugs!

'''Mowgli:''' Ha-ha-ha! (MOWGLI GASPS) -Peuch!

'''Baloo:''' Yes, yes, all very amusing, but this wild garlic is the thing to steal honey from the bees. Don't like the smell, you see. So if it's honey you're after, wild garlic is the way to get it. The safest way to get your honey though is to wait until after dark. You see, bees are like any other creature - they need to sleep.

'''Baloo:''' (''Walking to the lake'') And another thing is that bees don't like is water. Should you be trying to get your honey while Cousin Bee is awake well, a bee can't sting you under water. Ah! (''Baloo falls into the lake'')

'''Mowgli:''' (''Whispering to Bagheera'') Have you heard enough about bees for one day?

'''Bagheera:''' (''Whispering to Mowgli'') For a month!

'''Mowgli:''' (''Whispering to Bagheera'') Me too. Come on.

'''Baloo:''' (''Coming up for air resuming the lesson'') And water's good for getting rid of the smell too. (''Turning around noticing no one there'') Mowgli? Mowgli!(''Still looking'') I hadn't finished!

'''Baloo:''' Ah, there you are. (''Thinking he found Mowgli and pulls on the vine'') Got you! I... (''But surprised that he was encased by Kaa'') Ah! Ha-ha-ha! Kaa, I was expecting someone else. Ha-ha!

'''[[Kaa]]:''' I don't take kindly to being woken just after a meal. I think I ought to teach you (''Squeezing tighter'') some manners.

'''Baloo:''' Ah! Get off, Kaa! I'm sorry! I...didn't... Argh!

'''Bagheera:''' Ha-ha-ha! Poor Baloo! I wonder if he's still telling us about bees and garlic and...

'''Mowgli:''' Wow! Look at those cliffs!

'''Bagheera:''' Uh-oh! Mowgli! Those cliffs are...

'''Mowgli:''' Last one to the top's a warthog's ugly brother!

'''Bagheera:''' Mowgli! Come back! (''Bagheera climbs after him but is unable too.'') (''yelling'') '''MOWGLI!''' These cliffs are full of danger. Baloo! I must get Baloo!

'''[[Shere Khan]]:''' (''Messing with a spider'') Today's the day I'll get the man cub- 

'''Bagheera:''' - Baloo!

'''Shere Khan:''' -I feel it in my... (''Getting pounced on by Bagheera and swallowed the spider.'')

'''Bagheera:''' Baloo!

'''Shere Khan:''' (''Spitting the spider out'') Pah! Pah! Who dares to...? (''Seeing Bagheera and follows him'') The man cub's panther-friend, eh? Well, where the panther is, the accursed little rat won't be far away.

'''Mowgli:''' (''He continues to climb'') Huh! (''Making it to the top and starts walking but almost falls through.'')Not as solid as it looks! Huh! (''Bees buzz in a swarm'') Bees! What on... Wow! It looks like this is one giant bees' nest! (''The bees surround him) Get away from here!  (''He tries to run'') Ow! Ow! (''falls off the cliff'') No! Whoa! Ugh! (''Lands into the water'') 

'''Bagheera:''' Baloo! It's Mowgli! He's...(''Surprised at the bear's predicament'') -Baloo?

'''Baloo:''' -Lend a paw here, Bagheera! Kaa doesn't seem to be in a very good mood.

'''Kaa:''' (''Seeing Shere Khans he lets Baloo go and slithers away'') We'll continue your lesson in good manners some other time, Baloo.

'''Baloo:''' Ugh! Know when you're beaten, eh, Kaa? Seems as if I won't be needing your help after all, Bagheera. Where's Mowgli?

'''Shere Khan:''' The very question I was about to ask.

'''Bagheera''' and '''Baloo''': Shere Khan!

'''Shere Khan:''' At your service. Now, where is the man cub? Well, it looks as if I'll have to beat the answer out of you, doesn't it? (''Leaps towards the pair'') Grrraaargh!

'''Mowgli:''' (''Surfacing'') Ah! Ohh... Ha-ha! Baloo was right - (''Heading to shore'') bees don't like water. Thanks, Baloo!

'''Baloo:''' Ah, I showed that bully of a tiger!

'''Bagheera:''' -A-hem!

'''Baloo:''' -Er, with a little help from you, of course.

'''Mowgli:''' Bagheera! What's happened?

'''Bagheera:''' A little set-to with Shere Khan.

'''Mowgli:''' Oh, Baloo! (''Embraces Baloo'')

'''Baloo:''' Oh! Steady on, Mowgli! Just a little tender there.

'''Mowgli:''' So Shere Khan did this, eh? Well, he's not going to get away with it.

'''Bagheera:''' Now, Mowgli, you won't do anything rash?

'''Mowgli:''' Some friend I'd be if I stood by and let Shere Khan batter you? I'm going to get him!

'''Baloo:''' You will do no such thing! What chance do you have against a maddened tiger?

'''Mowgli:''' Oh, not much, I suppose.

'''Baloo:''' So let that be an end to... (''Still in pain'') Ooh!

'''Mowgli:''' Baloo, what was it you said about bees sleeping, again?

'''Baloo:''' So you WERE listening...a bit! Once the sun goes down, our friend the bee...

'''Mowgli:''' Friend?! The ones I found today weren't exactly friendly!

'''Baloo:''' What bees?!

'''Mowgli:''' I met a swarm of them by the marble cliffs.

'''Baloo:''' Shouldnâ€™t go there?? Those bees are killers! Not even Hathi the elephant dares to brave the fury of the black bees.

'''Mowgli:''' Good.

'''Baloo:''' Now, Mowgli, you are not under any circumstances whatever, you are NOT to go near those bees again! Understood?

'''Mowgli:''' -Yes, Baloo. (''Fingers crossed behind his back'')

(''Nightfall and Mowgli returns to the Marble Cliffs with stones and gets to work'')
'''Mowgli:''' I'll teach that tiger-skin-rug-in-waiting not to mess with Baloo. (''Noticing a bee'') Hey, bee! Don't you know anything? You're supposed to be asleep! (''The bee retreats back to it's hole'') That's better.

'''Baloo:'''(''Morning and Baloo begins another lesson'') Now, today I shall be telling you how to keep on the right side of a muskrat.

'''Mowgli:''' So which is the right side of a muskrat? This side or this side?

'''Baloo:''' Ah, now that's not as silly a question as you might think.

(''Mowgli yawns'')

'''Baloo:''' You see, the musk... The musk... (''he yawns'') Mowgli, do try to pay attention!

'''Mowgli:''' -I'm all ears, Baloo. (''He yawns again'') 

'''Baloo:''' (''He yawns again and clears his throat'') Now, where was I? 

'''Mowgli:''' (''He yawns a third time'') You were saying...

'''Baloo:''' So I was. So I was...(''Baloo falls asleep'')

'''Mowgli:''' Ha-ha! Just too easy. (''whispering'') Sleep tight, Baloo...and watch out, Shere Khan. (''Placing his tracks'') To make it nice and easy for Shere Khan to follow me.

'''Bagheera:''' -Good morning, Baloo. 

'''Baloo:''' (''Snoring'') Oh! Um...

'''Bagheera:''' -Where's Mowgli 

'''Baloo:''' -He's right here, of c... Ohh... Mowgli? Mowgli!

'''Shere Khan:''' (''Growls at noticing the man cubs footprints and follows'') Really, you surprise me, Baloo. I thought you'd have taught your pupil better jungle-craft than this. I could follow this track with my eyes closed!

'''Mowgli:''' I hope I haven't made the trail too easy. (''Hearing the tiger's growl'') -Uh-oh!

'''Shere Khan:''' -I have you now, man cub!

Grrrroarrrgh! 

Ugh! Oh! 

SHERE KHAN GRUNTS

Grrrroarrrgh!

'''Mowgli:''' Ah! Whoa! Oh, no! Not going to make it!

SHERE KHAN PANTS

Grrrroarrrgh!

-Oh! Urgh! 

-BEES BUZZ

'''Shere Khan:''' There is no escape now! (''Bees buzzing louder and surround the tiger'') Argh! Ooh! What's that? Argh! Oooh!

'''Mowgli:''' No-one hurts my friends.

'''Shere Khan:''' -Get away from me! 

'''Mowgli:''' Oh, no! Not more stings! Here goes!

'''Shere Khan:''' Argh! Argh! Get off! Get away! Argh! No! Aaargh! No! Argh! Get off! Get away!

'''Mowgli:''' Phew! Mowgli one, Shere Khan nil.

(Both): Nil! 

'''Baloo:''' Don't you ever run off like that again!

'''Bagheera:''' But, Baloo, he did leave an easy trail for us to follow.

'''Mowgli:''' Oh, I showed him! No-one messes with my friends and gets...

'''Baloo:''' Mowgli, I strictly forbade you from this course of action and you ignored me! You did quite magnificently! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh, the look on his face as he tumbled over the edge!

'''Bagheera:''' You should have seen the look on Shere Khan's face as he fell!

'''Baloo:''' Well! That is beside the point. Mowgli should have listened. He should have paid attention to what I said. Mind you, the tiger did look a little...
