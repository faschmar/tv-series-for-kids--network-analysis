{{TD|Ronaldo (''Narrator'')| [[Beach City]], a sleepy seaside town. From far away, it looks ordinary, but take a closer look, and you'll start to notice the cracks in the facade.}}
{{TD||(''The film pans across Beach City from the perspective of the beach, pointing towards the [[Lighthouse]] hill, and a screen tear effect rips the scene apart.}}

{{TD|Ronaldo| My name is... *spins his chair too much* Uh... *blushes and clears his throat* My name is Ronaldo. (''A slideshow of different conspiracies from his blog appears on-screen.'') For years, I've run a blog called "''Keep Beach City Weird''". My mission: keep Beach City weird, and also to expose the truth. Most people choose to ignore my mind-blowing revelations, but no one can deny it when the truth was pointing right in the town's collective face! }}
{{TD||(''A footage, with a subtitle reading "Actual Footage", begins to play an event during "[[The Return]]", where the [[Gem Warship]] was about to land upon Beach City.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo (''Footage'') | *gasps* It's an invasion! Look at that thing, it's right there!}}
{{TD||(''The footage pauses and zooms in on the warship.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo (''Narrator'')| Beach City needed to be saved, but from what? (''A picture of the [[Crystal Gems]] is shown.'') Duh, duh, duh!}}
{{TD||(''A documentary title card reading "Rising Tides/Crashing Skies" is then shown, followed by more sub-texts: "Danger On The Boardwalk", "The Truth About The Most Dangerous Boardwalk" and "A KBCW Investigative Documentary".}}

{{TD||(''Ronaldo begins interviewing various Beach City citizens, starting with [[Nanefua]]: "Local Business Owner".'')}}
{{TD|Nanefua | Ehh, I was just cleaning up some fish for a very big order when it happened. I heard this veeery peculiar rumbling, like "boom boom boom boom boom boom!" and then a sonic "BOOM!" and the fish I was preparing flew up into the air and fell on the ground! (''A lax-animated re-enactment of a fish tumbling around plays.'') I ran outside and saw this great big thing in the sky. }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | The town was under attack! }}

{{TD||(''The film cuts away abruptly, and Ronaldo begins interviewing [[Peedee]]: "Fry Shop Employee"'')}}
{{TD|Peedee | Oh! Uh, yes! *sweats anxiously* That day was crazy. The [[Mayor Dewey|Mayor]] said— }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Were you scared? }}
{{TD|Peedee | What?! No! I wasn't. I was just concerned that something bad would happen to the shop... }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | So, you cried a lot. }}
{{TD|Peedee | I don't know what you're talking abo-}}
{{TD||(''An "Actual Footage" then cuts in, showing Peedee clinging to the shop counter while [[Mr. Fryman]] tried to pull him away.'')}}

{{TD||(''The footage ends, returning to Peedee being interviewed.'')}}
{{TD|Peedee | I was under a lot of stress at that time, argh! }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Aww... *walks on-screen* Hey... }}
{{TD|Peedee | What? }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | I'm here for you, bro. *hugs Peedee* }}
{{TD|Peedee | I'm fine, let me go! }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | You can't make up drama this good! }}
{{TD||(''Another "Actual Footage" plays, of Mr. Fryman driving Peedee and Ronaldo out of town to evacuate alongside other Beach Citizen citizens.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo (''Narrator'') | With the space hand closing in for a high-five of the third kind, we fled the town. But then, just as mysteriously as the space hand appeared, it exploded into an explosion. }}
{{TD||(''The place then rumbled with a loud explosion noise, and everyone stopped driving.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Fryman (''Footage'') | What in blue blazes was that? }}
{{TD|Peedee (''Footage'') | I think it was an explosion! }}
{{TD||(''The shot turns towards the Lighthouse hill, now emanating lots of smoke on the side.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo (''Footage'') | Unbelievable, I missed it! }}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Lighthouse Lantern Room] }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | There's no actual footage of the giant hand thing crashing into the beach, but here's a little re-enactment for you. }}
{{TD||[Trans. Beach] }}
{{TD||(''The film cuts to an re-enactment of the warship crashing, represented by Ronaldo's hand, on the beach.'')}}

{{TD|Sadie | Huh? }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Who do you think saved Beach City from the giant handcraft? }}
{{TD|Sadie | Oh! Hey Ronaldo... *blushes* Wait, a-are you filming? }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | *whispers* Just answer the question! }}
{{TD|Sadie | Oh, okay... Um, yeah sure... Who saved us? Um... well... wasn't it [[Steven]]'s... family? I-I think they pretty much keep to themselves... Steven says that they protect the planet and the human race and that they have magic powers... It sounds hard to believe, but I've seen some pretty wild stuff... }}

{{TD||(''Ronaldo interviews [[Kiki]]: "Pizza Heiress" next.'')}}
{{TD|Kiki| Once, they made us hamburgers, and we were having a pretty good time, but then we were attacked by a [[Watermelon Tourmaline|huge creature]]!}}

{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Mayor's Office]]] }}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo then interviews Mayor Dewey: "Mayor Dewey" in his office.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Mayor Dewey, who do you think saved Beach City from the handcraft? }}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey | Why, young man, I credit the voters with saving Beach City! My constituents know they've elected a mayor they can trust to— }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Huh? No, I'm talking about the Crystal Gems. }}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey | Heh, w-why? }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Well I'm covering the story— }}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey | Cover up? WHAT COVER UP?! }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | But— }}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey | SECURITY! }}
{{TD||(''Mayor Dewey's [[Minor_Characters/Humans#Mayor_Dewey.27s_Bodyguards|bodyguards]] rush in to cover up the shot.'') }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | H-hey! You can't suppress the ''truth!'' }}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Lighthouse Lantern Room] }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Obviously, the Crystal Gems were involved, even at the highest levels of local government. I decided to go to the source. }}

{{TD|Steven | *opens the door and steps out* Hi, Ronaldo! Uh, hi, Peedee! Is that a camera? }}
{{TD|Peedee | Yeah! We're making a movie about— }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | It's an investigative report, shot camera vérité. }}
{{TD|Steven | ''Cool!'' }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | So, want to participate in a groundbreaking interview? }}
{{TD|Steven | Hmm... Only if ''you'' participate in a glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade! }}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Beach House] }}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo is invited into the house for some lemonade and begins interviewing Steven "Gracious Host".'') }}
{{TD|Steven | Oh, that giant hand? It was a spaceship coming to get us! }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Us? I knew it! Steven, we know too much! }}
{{TD|Steven | No, not "us" us. I meant me and the Crystal Gems. }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Wait, so the hand wasn't here to snatch up humans for a [[Pink Diamond's Zoo|human zoo]]? Or interfere with our subsidized Beach City wind farm?! OR THAW OUT THE CRYOGENICALLY FROZEN PETS OF THE ONE PERCENT?!?! }}
{{TD|Steven | Um... no, I'm pretty sure it just came to Beach City for me and the Crystal Gems. }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Oh. So... if you and the Crystal Gems weren't here... we wouldn't have been attacked by the giant hand? }}
{{TD|Steven | Oh-ho-ho, definitely not! }}
{{TD||(''The film then zooms in on Steven's face and turns negative.'') }}
{{TD|Ronaldo (''Narrator'')| And there it was. (''The conspiracy slideshow sweeps away, showing the picture of the Crystal Gems from before.'') The Crystal Gems weren't saving us, they were putting us in danger! }}
{{TD||(''A big red "X" is drawn over the Crystal Gems picture.'') }}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Lighthouse Lantern Room] }}

{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[Fish Stew Pizza]]] }}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo then begins interviewing the Beach City citizens about the "truth", starting with Nanefua and Kofi, as they are putting trash in the dumpster behind the restaurant.'')}}

{{TD|Nanefua | Oh, well... No more fish are getting knocked out of my hands, so I'm not complaining. }}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. BC Boardwalk] }}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo interviews [[Onion]]: "??????" next.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo | *points a microphone to Onion* Sir, sir! How do you feel about the Crystal Gems attracting an onslaught of dangerous space beings? Do you feel safe? }}
{{TD||(''Onion inhales to speak, only to knock the microphone out of Ronaldo's hands and run away.'') }}

{{TD||[Trans. Int. Beach Citywalk Fries] }}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo next asks Mr. Fryman: "Executive Producer, "Rising Tides, Crashing Skies"", frying fries inside the shop kitchen.'') }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | How can you possibly go on, knowing that we are under siege by forces meant to destroy the Crystal Gems? }}
{{TD|Mr. Fryman | *annoyed* How close are you to being done with this project? }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Just answer the question, Dad! }}
{{TD|Mr. Fryman | Ugh. I-I guess it's pretty bad, but what's a regular old guy like me supposed to do about it? I've got work to do... and so do you, put down that camera. }}
{{TD||(''Mr. Fryman approaches and places his hand over the screen. The film fizzles and cuts to Ronaldo setting up a camera in the kitchen, acting and voicing over himself.'') }}
{{TD|Ronaldo (''Narrator'') | Everyone was too afraid to realize that they were actually afraid. (''Peedee starts mopping the floor behind Ronaldo and puts up a "Wet Floor" sign.'') Beach City needed a hero, and that hero would have to be ''me''. (''Ronaldo steps backwards and slips on the wet floor.'') WHOA, WHOA— }}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Crystal Temple] }}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo switches the film to night vision, while fighting and yelling are heard in the background.'') }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Okay, everything's ready for our full on night time stealth coverage. }}
{{TD|Peedee | Is it really okay for us to be lurking around like this? }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | We're not lurking, we're investigating! This is a moment of true bravery, are you brave like me? I'm so brave to be doing this. Come on! }}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo runs to peek behind a rock. [[Amethyst]] then lands into the scene and Steven falling from the air, while small one-eyed crabs crawl by.'') }}

{{TD|Amethyst | Race you back to the danger zone. *runs and leaps off*}}
{{TD|Steven | Wait up! }}

{{TD|Ronaldo | CUT THE PLEASANTRIES! }}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo runs up to Steven, and Peedee follows suit, holding the camera while running.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo | You're all a danger to our city! }}

{{TD||(''Garnet parries the Crab Monster's claw attack. Pearl then starts blasting away at it with her spear.''}}

{{TD|Pearl | Aye-aye, Garnet! Where's Amethyst? }}
{{TD|Amethyst | Right here!}}
{{TD||(''The Crab Monster tries to shield its eyes with its other claw, but Amethyst slices it off with her hair. The monster shrieks and runs away.''}}
{{TD|Garnet | Let's finish the job! }}
{{TD||(''The Gems chase away the monster while Ronaldo continues shouting at Steven.''}}
{{TD|Ronaldo | This is exactly the thing I'm talking about, Steven! }}
{{TD|Steven | But the Crystal Gems are here to help people! }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | But all the monsters just come here to get ''you guys'', and then wreck things and put us in danger! Beach City would be way safer if you guys weren't here! }}
{{TD||(''The Gems defeats the Crab Monster off-screen and bubbles its gem. They then walk in to join Steven, and Ronaldo starts chastising the Crystal Gems: "Beach City would be way safer if they weren't here".''}}
{{TD|Pearl | Listen, Frybo, magic beings are indeed drawn to us, but we were here long before Beach City even existed. }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Who cares how long you've been here? Innocent people are in danger as long as you're hanging around! }}
{{TD|Garnet | You're right, I guess we'll just leave then. }}
{{TD|Pearl | Excuse me? }}
{{TD|Amethyst | Really? }}
{{TD|Steven | But, Garnet...! }}
{{TD|Garnet | Put your buts away, Steven. *puts Steven on top of her hair* We're not wanted here, so let's just leave. }}
{{TD|Pearl | But Garnet, we'll have to move all the bubbles, a-and what about Steven's things? }}
{{TD|Amethyst | Maaaaaaan, ugh, I kinda liked it here! }}

{{TD|Ronaldo | Aahhh... That's right, I did it! Thanks to me, the Gems are gone forever! }}
{{TD|Peedee | Hm, that's too bad, now you won't have anything to blog about anymore. }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Come on, dude, I'm trying to finish the movie! }}
{{TD|Peedee | Well this relates to your movie, you said it yourself, the Gems cause all the weird stuff in Beach City, so now that they're gone, there'll be no more weird stuff. }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | No. Nooo! WHAT HAVE I DONE?!?!}}
{{TD||(''The film pauses and flashes red dramatically.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo (''Narrator'')| What had I done.. I done bad.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Lighthouse Lantern Room] }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | I made a terrible mistake. *shakes his head* }}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Crystal Temple] }}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo is running and panting heavily towards the Beach House.'') }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | *distantly* THIS IS A MATTER OF WEIRD AND DEATH! }}

{{TD|Peedee | *panting* I'm going... as fast as I can! }}
{{TD||(''Peedee arrives at the porch and starts filming Ronaldo banging on the door.'') }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | CRYSTAL GEMS!!! You have to stay! Every messed up consequence of your presence gives me reason to wake up in the morning! Without you, my blog doesn't stand a chance! Ah, I'm too late, what have I done? I've made Beach City... '''''NORMAL!''''' *cries* I've broken my promise to the city, and to myself! }}
{{TD||(''Garnet then appears at the door.'') }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | Ooooooooooh, you're still here! Please don't leave! I was wrong, stay and keep this town weird!}}
{{TD||(''The film flashes red dramatically again.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo (''Narrator'')| I had no idea how this Crystal Gem would respond to my plea. The answer will '''''SHOCK YOU.''''' }}

{{TD|Garnet | Okay. }}
{{TD|Ronaldo | *sobbing* Thank you, thank you, thank you!}}

{{TD||(''Ronaldo stands alone on the Brooding Hill, staring out to sea and voicing over his monologue.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo (''Narrator'')| I had skillfully negotiated for the Gems to stay, perhaps I have a future in... intergalactic diplomacy? *laughs* In the end, I suppose the Gems really do save Beach City— from being not weird!}}
{{TD|Ronaldo | *turns to the camera* Okay, Peedee, I think that about wraps it up! Good job with the camera, bro! }}
{{TD|Peedee | Oh, thanks! }}
{{TD||(''The film ends with a Movie-Maker-esque credits sequence. It is then revealed that the Crystal Gems are just watching Ronaldo's video on Steven's laptop.'') }}
{{TD|Garnet | That was very poorly edited. }}
{{TD|Steven | Were we really gonna leave Beach City? }}
{{TD|Garnet | No, I just wanted him to get that camera out of my face. }}
{{TD|Pearl | I wonder how many people have seen this thing? }}
{{TD|Amethyst | Oh, *laughs* I think WE'RE the only ones, see?}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst points to the TubeTube screen, showing that the video only has exactly only "1" view.'') }}
