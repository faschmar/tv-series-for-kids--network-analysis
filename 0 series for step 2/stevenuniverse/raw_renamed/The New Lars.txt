{{TD||[Open Int. The [[Big Donut]]]}}
{{TD||(''[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] is inside the Big Donut asking a trivial question to [[Sadie Miller|Sadie]] and [[Lars Barriga|Lars]] behind the counter, as an imaginative slideshow is displayed over his question.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|For your consideration...The koala, a marsupial from the forests of Australia, and the sloth, hailing from the forests of South America. Who should be crowned the king of the "Hanging Around Doing Nothing" mammals!?}}
{{TD|Sadie|I think sloths eat poop.}}
{{TD|Lars|Gross.}}
{{TD|Steven|Well, that's definitely going to affect the rankings.}}
{{TD|Lars|Eating poop would be better than this.}}
{{TD|Sadie|*snickers* Just, let him do his thing.}}
{{TD|Lars|So glad I don't have to deal with this tomorrow.}}
{{TD|Sadie|Oh, yeah, they're closing shop to get those gulls out of the vents. Any plans?}}
{{TD|Lars|Nah.}}
{{TD|Sadie|Would you... want to come by my place? I know it's kind of... been awhile, but we could get some food, watch some movies.}}
{{TD|Lars|Nah. Sounds boring. I'll see if [[Buck Dewey|Buck]] wants to do stuff.}}
{{TD|Sadie|*slightly dismayed* Well, I hope you guys have fun together.}}
{{TD|Lars|Yeah. We will.}}
{{TD||(''Sadie and Lars suddenly remember Steven is still here.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie|Hey, Steven? You're staring a little bit.}}
{{TD|Steven|*staring intently with widened eyes, and whispers* No, I'm not.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. The Big Donut]}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Lars exit the Big Donut, as Lars starts locking the door.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Hey, Lars? why didn't you want to hang out with Sadie?}}
{{TD|Lars|*grunts* I see her at work. Why do I need to see her on my day off?}}
{{TD|Steven|But aren't you going to get married, and have kids, and name one of them after his uncle Steven?}}
{{TD|Lars|Oh, let me think... No! Me and Sadie aren't getting married. We aren't even dating. And if she thinks we are, that's her problem.}}
{{TD|Steven|You're lying! I know how you feel about Sadie.}}
{{TD|Lars|You don't know what you're talking about, so ''butt out!'' *walks off* Go annoy someone else! You little weirdo.}}
{{TD|Steven|Why can't you just admit you love her?!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Beach House]], Night-time]}}
{{TD||(''Steven is sleeping in his bed, tossing and turning restlessly.''.)}}
{{TD|Steven|*mumbles in his sleep* Lars.}}
{{TD||(''Steven enters his dreamscape and sees Lars floating alone in the darkness.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Lars? You don't need to be such a jerk all the time. I wish I could just SHOW YOUUU-}}
{{TD||(''Lars turns around and Steven unwillingly speeds up towards him, seemingly colliding into Lars.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Aah!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Barriga Residence|Lars' Room]], Morning]}}
{{TD||(''Lars is then seen suddenly waking up with a [[Minor Objects/Media#NOICE|magazine]] on his face.'')}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Aah! Huh? *takes the magazine off his face* Wha? Whoa. Wait a minute. }}
{{TD||(''"Lars" looks around his own room.'') }}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|This isn't the [[Crystal Temple|temple]]. *looks at himself* This isn't my ''voice!'' Whoa- I'm Lars!?}}
{{TD||(''Steven then realized he is inside Lars' body, and he gets up in shock and notices himself in the mirror.'')}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Ooh-ho-ho-ho-ho! *whimpers and covers his eyes* I'm naked! I must've jumped into Lars' mind. I guess while I'm in here, I'd better do my best to respect Lars' body... And his privacy.}}
{{TD||(''Lars (Steven) dresses himself up and heads downstairs of his house, when he heard voices into the kitchen.'')}}
{{TD|[[Dante and Martha Barriga|Martha]]|No. We can do this, Dante. We have to talk to him.}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Hi, there.}}
{{TD||(''Dante and Martha, revealing to be Lars' parents, turn around and notice Lars (Steven).'')}}
{{TD|Dante|Oh, there's our boy. How are you feeling?}}
{{TD||(''Lars (Steven) sits down at the table.'')}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Uh... taller?}}
{{TD||(''Martha places Lars' breakfast down in front of him.'')}}
{{TD|Martha|Here you go. Oh, it's good to see you this morning, Laramie. *holds up Lars' (Steven's) face*}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*smiles* Who's Laramie?}}
{{TD|Martha|*shocked* I mean... Lars.}}
{{TD||(''Martha sits down next to Dante at the table.'')}}
{{TD|Dante|Now, Lars, we know school is a touchy subject, but we need to talk about this.}}
{{TD||(''Dante shows Lars (Steven) his grade report, and Lars (Steven) reads the grades on the report literally.'')}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|"F-F-F-F-F-F-B-D-F". ...That doesn't spell anything.}}
{{TD|Martha|Please, Lars. *holds hands with Dante* We let you move into the attic, and your grades are still below average. All we're asking from you is...}}
{{TD|Dante & Martha|A little effort!}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*gets emotional* Wow. You guys seem so nice. I'm sure I don't want to let either of you down. *grabs Martha and Dante's hands* I, Lars, promise to go out and do my very best at being your son.}}
{{TD||(''Martha and Dante sit in shock, as Lars (Steven) gets up and leaves.'')}}
{{TD|Dante|Wow! He didn't even swear.}}
{{TD|Martha|And he's wearing the plugs I got him.}}
{{TD||(''Martha and Dante embrace each other.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Beach City]]]}}
{{TD||(''Lars (Steven) strolls along the streets, talking to himself in delight.'')}}

{{TD|Lars (Steven)|♫ I'm Lars for the day. ♫}}
{{TD||(''Lars (Steven) then sees Buck and Sour Cream leaning against the back of a building.'')}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Hey, it's Buck and Sour Cream! *waves at the duo* Hi, guys!}}
{{TD||(''Buck and Sour Cream look at each other briefly, as Lars (Steven) approaches them.'')}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Whatcha doing? Hanging out?}}
{{TD|Buck|Yeah.}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|That's cool. Would you say you hang out more like koalas or sloths? Uh, I'm asking for Steven.}}
{{TD|Buck|I like that kid.}}
{{TD||(''Sour Cream nods his head in approval.'')}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Yeah, he's the best. *chuckles to himself*}}
{{TD|Buck|Tell Steven we're more like sleeping tigers.}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Okay. Then I'll be a panther. *growls*}}
{{TD||(''Buck and Sour Cream smile, when they see [[Jenny Pizza|Jenny]] coming out from the back door of the building.'')}}
{{TD|Jenny|Oh. Hey, Lars. *looks away awkwardly*}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Hi, Jenny.}}
{{TD|Jenny|Ugh. Dad made me work this morning. Now I stink like pizza and fish.}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|You don't stink.}}
{{TD|Jenny|Lars?! What a nice thing to say!}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|I can say way nicer stuff. Like you're really cool and pretty and fun to be around.}}
{{TD|Jenny|*laughs* Lars, this is so unlike you.}}
{{TD|Buck|I see what's going on here.}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*flinches* Huh!?}}
{{TD|Buck|This isn't the Lars we know. *approaches Lars (Steven)* Maybe Lars is actually... A good guy who likes making people feel good. *grins*}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Yep, you got me.}}
{{TD|Buck|That's the kind of vibe I want on our dance crew.}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*gasps* Lars is going to be psyched!}}
{{TD|Buck|Buck is pleased.}}
{{TD|Jenny|Can he dance, though?}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Can I?!}}
{{TD||(''Lars (Steven) starts breaking out a few moves while humming to himself.'')}}
{{TD|Jenny|Whoa! Lars got moves!}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Whoo.}}
{{TD|Buck|We going to a dance competition and we need you. Come with us!}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*gasps deeply, but then realizes something* Oh. Sorry. I can't. There's someone who needs me more.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[Miller Residence]]]}}
{{TD||(''Lars (Steven) heads towards Sadie's home, knocks on her front door and clicks the doorbell.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie|Okay, okay. *opens the door* Geez, hold your horses.}}
{{TD||(''Sadie walks out, wearing a bathrobe, and is shocked to see Lars (Steven) at her doorstep.'')}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Still want to hang out?}}
{{TD|Sadie|Well, if it ain't the human boomerang; always coming back to me. *glares at Lars, unimpressed*}}
{{TD||(''Lars (Steven) looks behind him, thinking Sadie is referring to someone else, and then looks back at Sadie with sad puppy eyes, realizing she means Lars.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie|Look, sorry. I was going to watch a movie if-if you wanna? I don't -- I don't know. *chuckles nervously* N-Nothing fancy.}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|I don't need anything fancy.}}
{{TD|Sadie|*chuckles* Just get in here. (''Lars (Steven) enters her house.'') Are those hearts in your ears? *closes the door*}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Sadie's Bedroom]}}
{{TD||(''Sadies leads Lars (Steven) into her bedroom, turns off her bathrobe, revealing a gothic-like shirt, and drops it on her plush pile.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie|There's a bunch of stuff down there you probably haven't seen yet. *flops onto the plush pile* Take your pick.}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*examines Sadie's movie collection* "Night Terrors", "Enjoy the Violence", "Critter Crematorium", "The Organ Pickler... Part 7"!?}}
{{TD|Sadie|I keep telling you, that's the good one.}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|How about this? *holds out a movie box to Sadie* "Fangs of Love."}}
{{TD|Sadie|*unamused* I think I'd rather have my organs pickled.}}
{{TD||(''Lars (Steven) and Sadie watch "Fangs of Love" together in the dark.'')}}
{{TD|Male Werewolf (TV)|And you love me? Even like this?}}
{{TD|Female Werewolf (TV)|I dooooooooo!}}

{{TD|Sadie|*laughs* Didn't I try to warn you?}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*crying* They just wanted... to be together. *sobs*}}
{{TD|Sadie|Hey? *grabs a tissue box* What is with you tonight, huh?}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*sniffles and takes a tissue* What do you mean? *blows his nose and continues sniffling*}}
{{TD|Sadie|Look, It's like yesterday I asked if you wanted to come over, but you made a big deal, saying "no" in front of Steven. And now, you're here...? It's just, it's getting to be kind of a roller coaster, isn't it?}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*suddenly becomes ecstatic* Roller coasters are fun!}}
{{TD|Sadie|*sighs* It's like you're one way in private and a different way in public. You act like I don't know you don't want to be seen with me, but I do know. I'm not stupid.}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Don't be sad.}}
{{TD||(''Lars (Steven) puts his hand on Sadie's shoulder, but she quickly pulls her away.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie|It's just, I need to know. How do you really feel about me?}}

{{TD|Sadie|Ugh! *quickly jumps off her bed* What are you doing?!}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Finally telling you.}}
{{TD|Sadie|*gets angry* NGH! ARE YOU ''KIDDING'' ME?! All right, I get it. I see how it is. Some cute little heart gauges, some dumb, fluffy movie, "That's enough for Sadie!" Right, Lars? *glares at Lars*}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*starts panicking* Uh, d- I-I-I just wanted to fix everything.}}
{{TD|Sadie|'''Get. ''Out.'''''}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Miller Residence]}}
{{TD||(''Sadie shoves Lars (Steven) out of her house.'')}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|Stop, you're hurting me!}}
{{TD|Sadie|Good! *shuts the door*}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|You don't understand!}}
{{TD|Sadie|I understand enough! You're only my friend when it's convenient for you. *bangs on her door in anger* Just get ''out'' of my life!}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*inhales deeply in regrets* I'M NOT ''LARS''!!}}
{{TD|Sadie|What!?}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|I'm... Steven. I just woke up this morning with my mind in Lars' body. *leans against Sadie's door* Ugh! I didn't mean to hurt your feelings like this. I'm sorry.}}
{{TD||(''Sadie opens the door calmly.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie|Okay, maybe you are Steven. Lars would never apologize to me. Wait!... So does this mean Lars' mind is inside your body? }}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|I don't know.}}
{{TD|Sadie|You don't know!?}}
{{TD|Lars (Steven)|*sheepishly* Maybe we should check?}}
{{TD|Sadie|Ya think?!}}

{{TD||(''[[The Cool Kids]] are seen strolling down a street, with Sour Cream holding a silver trophy.'')}}

{{TD|Dante|What's going on!?}}

{{TD|Lars|A-And what did she say?}}
{{TD|Steven|She thought you'd only say something like that to hurt her.}}
{{TD|Lars|Yeah... I guess she's right. Maybe that's why everyone liked the ''you'' me better than the ''real'' me.}}
{{TD|Steven|Not everyone.}}
