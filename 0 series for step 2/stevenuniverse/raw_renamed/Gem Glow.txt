{{TD|[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]|'''''NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!'''''}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Big Donut]}}
{{TD|Steven|*looking at an empty freezer* This can't be happening! This has to be a dream! [[Lars Barriga|Lars]]! Lars! *grabs Lars around his waist* Please tell me I'm dreaming!}}
{{TD|Lars|*shakes Steven off* Get off me man, I'm stocking here!}}
{{TD|[[Sadie Miller|Sadie]]|I'm sorry, Steven. I guess they stopped making them.}}
{{TD|Steven| Stopped making them?! Why in the world would they stop making [[Cookie Cat|Cookie Cats]]?! They're only the most scrumptious and delicious ice-cream sandwich ever made! Don't they have laws for this?!}}
{{TD|Lars|*kneels to restock a cabinet and sighs* Tough bits, man. Nobody buys them anymore. *stocks shelves* I guess they couldn't compete with "[[Lion Lickers]]".}} 
{{TD|Steven|*groans as he walks over to the fridge of "Lion Lickers"* Not "Lion Lickers"! Nobody likes them! They don't even look like lions! Kids these days -- I'll tell ya what!}}
{{TD|Lars|*chuckles and mocks* Well, if you miss your wimpy ice cream so much, why don't you make some with your "magic belly button"? *laughs and walks away*}}
{{TD|Steven|That's not how it works, Lars! ...Right? *reveals a [[Gemstones#Unfused Gemstones|gem]] at his navel and jiggles his belly* Oh, sweet Cookie Cats,  with your crunchy cookie outside and your icy creamy insides... You were too good for this world. *draws a cookie cat on the freezer with his finger and kisses it*}}
{{TD|Sadie|Uh... Steven?}}
{{TD||(''Steven doesn't reply as he hugs the freezer.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie|Do you want to take the freezer with you?}}
{{TD||(''Lars leans over and looks at Steven in confusion. Steven nods.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[Beach House]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven hums "[[Cookie Cat (song)|Cookie Cat]]" while running home, carrying the Cookie Cat freezer on his back.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Beach House]}}
{{TD|Steven|*opens the door of his home* Hey, guys, you won't believe this! }}
{{TD||(''Steven is suddenly attacked by a [[Nephrite|Centipeetle]]. It roars at him and he screams. A whip then wraps around it, revealing to be [[Amethyst|Amethyst's]].'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|'Sup, Steven? *yanks the Centipeetle off of Steven*}}
{{TD||(''[[Pearl]] can be seen fighting off Centipeetles on the [[Warp Pad]], and [[Garnet]] is fighting in the kitchen.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Awesome! What are these things?}}
{{TD|Pearl|*groans and lifts up a Centipeetle* Ugh! Sorry, Steven. We'll get these Centipeetles out of your room. We think they were trying to get into the temple.}}
{{TD|Steven|Aw. You don't have to get rid of them. They're really cool.}} 
{{TD||(''The Centipeetle that Pearl is holding spits acid onto the floor, dissolving it into a hole, which Steven and Pearl look in disgust.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*poofs a Centipeetle and picks her nose* Um, you guys? These things don't have gems.}}
{{TD|Garnet|That means there must be a mother somewhere nearby.}}
{{TD||(''A Centipeetle sneaks up from beside Garnet, which she quickly punches away.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|We should probably find it before anyone gets hurt.}}
{{TD|Steven|*excitedly* Oh! Oh! Can I come?! Can I?! Can I?!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven, until you learn to control the powers in your gem, we'll take care of protecting humanity, okay? *snaps the neck of the Centipeetle she is holding*}}
{{TD|Steven|Aw, man. *notices a Centipeetle raiding his fridge* Hey! Get out of there! Go on! Shoo! Shoo! Aw! They got into everything! Not cool!}}
{{TD||(''Garnet punches and poofs it. Steven then notices that the fridge is full of Cookie Cats.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|No way. I-it can't be! Wha-where did you get these?! I thought they stopped making them!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*closes the fridge* Well, we heard that, too, and since they're your favorite...}}
{{TD|Amethyst|We went out and stole a bunch.}}
{{TD|Pearl|*grunts at Amethyst* I went back and paid for them.}}
{{TD|Garnet|The whole thing was my idea. *retracts her gauntlets back to her gems*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|It was everyone's idea.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Not really.}}
{{TD|Pearl|All that matters is that Steven is happy.}}
{{TD||(''Steven starts rapping the "Cookie Cat" jingle.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|<poem><i>Oohhhhh!
He's a frozen treat with an all new taste
'Cause he came to this planet from outer space
A refugee of an interstellar war
But now he's at your local grocery store

Cookie Cat!
He's a pet for your tummy
Cookie Cat!
He's super duper yummy
Cookie Cat!
He left his family behind
Cookie Caaaaat!</i></poem> *spoken* Now available at Gurgens off Route 109!}}
{{TD||(''The Gems burst out in laughter and applause.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|I can't believe you did this. I'm gonna save these forever!... right after I eat this one. *tears open the wrapper of a Cookie Cat* Hello, old friend. *bites into it* Oh, so good! (''Steven's gem begins to glow.'') I like to eat the ears first.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Uh, Steven...}}
{{TD|Steven|Wha-? *lifts his shirt* My gem!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Quick, try and summon your [[Gem Weapons|weapon]]!}}
{{TD|Steven|I don't know how! *panicking* Aaaah, it's fading! How do I make it come back?!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Calm down, Steven. Breathe, don't force it.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Yeah, and try not to poop yourself either.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Please, don't.}}
{{TD||(''Steven's gem's glow fades away, everyone collectively sigh.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Ah, I was really close that time! Can one of you just explain how to summon a weapon?}}
{{TD|Pearl|*singsong voice* Oh, I'll go first!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Hill with a [[Pearl's Tree|blossoming tree]] with falling petals]}}
{{TD|Pearl|Pay attention to these petals, Steven. The petals' dance seems improvised, but it is being calculated in real time based on the physical properties of this planet. With hard work and dedication, you can master the magical properties of your gem and perform your own dance! *summons her [[Gem Weapons#Pearl's Spear|spear]] from her gem* Like so.}}
{{TD||(''Steven is in awe.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. the Big Donut]}}
{{TD|Steven|*tosses a bunch of petals in the air* Wuh!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Did Pearl tell you the petal thing?}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah, I need to practice really hard so I can dance like a tree... I think.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Listen Steven, all that practice stuff is no fun. Whenever I need to summon my weapon, it just happens. *summons her [[Gem Weapons#Amethyst's Whip|whip]] and breaks a nearby garbage container in two* See? Didn't try at all.}}
{{TD||(''Steven scratches his head.'')}}
{{TD|Lars|*runs outside and drops trash bag* Aaah! Again?!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. top of Crystal Temple near [[The Lighthouse|light house]]]}}
{{TD|Steven|So I'm supposed to work really hard and not try at all at the same time?}}
{{TD|Garnet|Yes.}}
{{TD||(''Steven already never listens and stands here with his silence.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Or... you could link your mind with the energy of all existing matter. Channeling the collective power of the universe through your gem, which results in... *summons her [[Gem Weapons#Garnet's Gauntlets|gauntlets]]* At least that's my way of doin' it.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Beach House kitchen]}}
{{TD|Steven|I think my best bet is to recreate what happened the last time my gem glowed. So... *points as he directs the Gems* Garnet and Amethyst were here. Pearl was next to the fridge. Hmm. Amethyst, I think your arms were crossed?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Okay, your majesty. *crosses arms*}}
{{TD|Steven|And Pearl, your foot was like this. *tilts one of her feet slightly*}}
{{TD|Pearl|I don't think it works this way, Steven.}}
{{TD|Steven|And Garnet, uh... *squishes and moves her face upward* Yeah. *retrieved the half-eaten Cookie Cat from before from the fridge* Then I took a bite of this Cookie Cat. Oh, wait! I sang the song first. *rapping in off-key* Uh, he's a frozen treat, all new taste, interstellar war, now available at Gurgens-}}
{{TD||(''Nothing happens.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Awww, it was funnier last time. *lifts his shirt to see his gem and sigh* Maybe I'm not a real Crystal Gem.}}
{{TD|Pearl|*bends down next to Steven* Don't be silly, Steven. Of course you are.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|And you're fun to have around, even if your gem is useless. (''Pearl gets angry at Amethyst.'') I mean... you're one of us, Steven. We're not the [[Crystal Gems]] without you!}}
{{TD|Garnet|*nods*}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah, even if I don't have powers, I've still got... Cookie Cat! *takes a bite* Mmm, so good.}}
{{TD||(''Steven’s gem begins to glow again, and a [[Gem Weapons#Steven's/Rose's Shield|shield]] materializes in front of him. The Gems collectively gasp.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|*amazed* Steven, it's a shield!}}
{{TD|Steven|... Whoa, what?! I get a shield?! Oh... YEAH!}} 
{{TD||(''Steven accidentally launches his shield which ricochets all around the room, before smashing into [[Steven's TV]]. Amethyst bursts out laughing while Pearl groans in disappointment.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Huh? Cookie Cat! I summon my weapon by eating ice cream!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*picks up the wrapper on the floor* What's in these things?}} 
{{TD||(''The house begins to rumbles. Silhouettes of Centipeetles can be seen outside the window. Steven's shield also disappears, leaving a dent in the TV.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|What was that?}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Crystal Temple]}}
{{TD||(''he Gems run out of the house and see a Centipeetle, biggest of all, crawling up the temple.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|It's [[Centipeetle Mother|the Mother]]! *leaps towards it*}}
{{TD|Pearl|Stay in the house, Steven!}}
{{TD|Steven|No way! I'm coming, too!}}
{{TD||(''Steven goes back to grab several Cookie Cats and the Cookie Cat freezer. Garnet begins her assault at the Centipeetle Mother. The battle descends towards the beach, as the Crystal Gems brace themselves for battle. The Centipeetle Mother sprays a stream of acid towards them, which they dodge out of the way and take refuge behind a broken hand statue of the temple on the beach. The Centipeetle Mother continues spraying acid, dealing considerable damage to the hand statue as it begins to melt.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|We could really use Steven's shield right about now!}}
{{TD|Steven|*chucks pebble at Mother* Hey! *plants the freezer into the ground* Leave them alone!}}
{{TD|Garnet, Pearl & Amethyst|Steven, no!}}
{{TD|Steven|Cookie Cat Crystal combo powers, activate! *eats a Cookie Cat and lifts his shirt*}}
{{TD||(''The Centipeetle Mother stares maniacally as nothing happens.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh-oh. Aaaah! *retreats a distance away with the freezer*}}
{{TD|Pearl|We need to save Steven! *dodges an attack from the Centipeetle Mother's tail pincers*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Can we save ourselves first?!}}
{{TD|Steven|Goodbye, my friends. *eats several Cookie Cats as he weeps, his stomach rumbles and still nothing happens* Why isn't it working? *dodges a spray of acid from the Centipeetle Mother*}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven!}}
{{TD||(''Garnet grabs hold of the Centipeetle Mother's pincers, drawing her attention. Steven notices the Cookie Cat freezer destroyed from the acid attack and gasps in horror.}}
{{TD|Steven|No... Oh, no, no, no, no, no! *slowly* [[Cookie Cat (character)|Cookie Cat]], he's a pet for your tummy. Cookie Cat, he's super duper ''yummy!'' *picks up the freezer aggressively* Cookie Cat, he left his family behind! COOKIE CAAAT!}}
{{TD||(''He chucks the freezer at the Centipeetle Mother's back, electrocuting her and causing her to screech in pain.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Now available... nowhere.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|YES!}}
{{TD|Garnet|Gems, weapons!}}
{{TD||(''The Gems summon their weapons and burst out of cover from the hand statue.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Let's do it.}}
{{TD||(''The Gems charge and attack the Centipeetle Mother altogether, defeating it for good. A gem falls from it and Garnet [[Bubbling|bubbles]] it away.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Farewell, sweet Cookie Cats. *buries a Cookie Cat wrapper in the ground* I'll always remember the time we spent together. *stomach rumbles* Shh... Hush now.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Are you crying?}}
{{TD|Steven|Only a little!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Well, I guess your powers don't come from ice cream.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Of course they don't come from ice cream. Don't worry, Steven, I'm sure some day you'll figure out how to activate your gem.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Yes, in your own Steven-y way.}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm okay, guys. I just- *stomach rumbles* Ugh, I think I ate too many Cookie Cats.}}
{{TD||(''The Gems start laughing, and Steven laughs anxiously in return. The star iris zooms in on Steven, as he bends over and retches, ending the episode.'')}}
