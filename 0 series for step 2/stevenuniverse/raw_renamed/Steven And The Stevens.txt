{{TD|[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]|Hey, how about this one here?}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]|*walks over to Steven* What one?}}
{{TD|Steven|This little one. *looks at the smallest [[The Hourglass|hourglass]] with starry eyes* It's ad-orb-able.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven, the legendary glass of time won't be nearly so small and insignificant. It'll be beautiful and grand. *looks at an big hourglass with an elegant design in excitement* Like this one!}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]|I think it's ''this'' one.}}
{{TD|Steven|*looks up* Whoa!}}
{{TD|Pearl|You mean the biggest one? (''Garnet, Steven and Pearl looks up at the giant hourglass.'') How are we even supposed to get that back to the [[Warp Pad]]?}}
{{TD|Garnet|I can carry it. *cracks her knuckles*}}
{{TD|Pearl|Wait! We need to be careful which one we touch, you remember what happened last time we were here.}}
{{TD|Steven|What happened?}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]|Hey, guys, I'm making the call. *picks up an oddly-shaped hourglass* And it's this janky one here!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Amethyst?!}}
{{TD||(''The Sea Shrine begins to rumble.'')}}

{{TD|Pearl|Steven, come on!}}
{{TD|Steven|*runs towards the Warp Pad* Imma comin'! Imma comin'!}}
{{TD||(''More water gushes into the shrine, forming a huge wave behind Steven. Pearl starts to panic and Garnet quickly stretches her arm forward.'')}}

{{TD|Amethyst|Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!}}
{{TD|Garnet|*brings Steven back to the warp pad* Gotcha!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Well done, Garnet!}}

{{TD||(''The Crystal Gems make it back to the Beach House's warp pad, bringing along a huge amount of water from the wave with them. The water soaks the whole room and washes Steven away from the Warp Pad, while the Gems have sea creatures clinging onto them.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hot potato! We're doing that again, right?}}
{{TD|Pearl|*removes a piece of seaweed from her hair* Unfortunately... we'll have to wait another hundred years for the sea shrine to reform because ''somebody'' couldn't keep their hands to themselves. *glares at Amethyst*}}
{{TD|Garnet|*removes an octopus from her head and turns to Pearl* You have [[Minor Characters/Animals#Butt Lobster|a lobster]] on your butt.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Huh? *looks down at her backside* EEEEEEEE!}}

{{TD|Garnet|Palooza.}}
{{TD|Steven|That was a lot of fun you guys. I'll see you later! After you sir. *opens the front door for [[Minor Characters/Animals#Blue Crab|a crab]]* Bye-bye!}}

{{TD|Yellowtail|*nods* Mmhmm.}}
{{TD|Steven|*approaches* Dad! Dad, you're ready to rehearse? Whoa!}}
{{TD||(''Steven then notices Yellowtail's fishing boat, stuck in the car wash.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Uhhh, we're having a bit of a day.}}
{{TD|Steven|Is it stuck?}}
{{TD|Greg|Yeah.}}
{{TD|Steven|Why does a boat need a car wash?}}
{{TD|Yellowtail|Hah! Huhuhhuh- *speaks in murmurs and walks towards the boat*}}
{{TD|Greg|Sorry, buddy, I don't think I can play in the concert tonight. I gotta deal with this.}}
{{TD|Steven|You're bailing on Beach-a-Palooza? But the whole town's gonna be there!}}
{{TD|Greg|Steven, that's like 15 people. *ruffles Steven's head* Next time, bud. I promise.}}
{{TD||(''Greg then walks off and starts talking to Yellowtail on his boat, as Steven turns away.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Stupid boat getting all stuck. Nobody likes you, boat! I wish I could've been there to tell my dad you were too fat!}} 
{{TD||(''Steven suddenly disappears. He then reappears back at It's a Wash, at the very moment when Greg is about to put the boat in the truck wash.'')}}

{{TD|Greg|Hey, schtu-ball! You excited for Beach-a-Palooza?}}
{{TD|Steven|Dad, Dad, fat, it's fat! Fat, fat fat!}}
{{TD|Greg|*looks at his own stomach* Rude.}}
{{TD|Steven|Not you! The boat! The boat!}}
{{TD|Greg|Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop!}}
{{TD|Yellowtail|*stops backing up the truck* Huh?}}
{{TD|Greg|Nice catch, Steven. *runs off*}}
{{TD|Steven|*pulls the hourglass out of his pocket and gasps* The thing! You took me back in time, didn't you? Oh, man! Pearl's gonna flip when she finds out you're the real one!}}
{{TD|Greg|Look, I'm sorry, but the boat's fat.}}
{{TD||(''Yellowtail gets off his truck and starts arguing in murmurs, when the truck starts rolling away.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Oh no, your truck!}}
{{TD||(''The truck crashes into an electric pole, knocking it over and it slams onto the truck. The electric wire then sparks and lights on fire. The fire travels along the wire to the roof of It's a Wash, causing an explosion and setting the whole roof on fire. Everyone screams in panic.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|*runs away* Gotta save the van!}}
{{TD|Steven|*horrified* I wish I could go back and stop myself from stopping my dad.}}

{{TD|Steven|Listen, two-minutes-ago-Steven, we can't go around trying to change time stuff. It just makes things worse.}}
{{TD||(''Yellowtail's boat gets stuck in the car wash once more.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Oh, no! How did this happen?}}
{{TD|Steven 2|Aw, man! I really wanted to play in Beach-a-Palooza. Too bad you and I can't be in a band.}}
{{TD|Steven & Steven 2|Wait a minute!}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Steven 2 warp back to a point where he is on his way to see his dad and tackle Steven 3 to the ground.'')}}

{{TD|Steven 3|Mmm... Steven? ... Steven? What's going on?}}
{{TD|Steven|No time to explain!}}
{{TD|Steven 2|Wanna join our band?!}}
{{TD|Steven 3|Yes! But didn't Dad say he would play with us?}}
{{TD|Steven 2|He had an emergency at the car wash.}}
{{TD|Steven 3|We should go help him! *tries to run off*}}
{{TD|Steven|No! *stops Steven 3* There's nothing we can do! The boat's fat, trust us.}}
