{{TD|Amethyst|So... I'm short. I stayed [[On the Run|in the ground a little too long.]] Got a little smushed. ''(Jasper chuckles)'' But maybe I'm OK like this, and maybe she's blowing things out 'cause she's got her own issues to work out.}}

{{TD|Jasper|WHO CARES WHAT YOU THINK RUNT!}}

{{TD|Jasper|'''[Frustrated grunt]''' '''[sigh]''' No one deserves to be made fun of because of how they look. If you catch your making hurtful comments... Maybe think about where that anger's coming from. '''[to Amethyst]''' How do you keep it cool like that? This's so much pressure.}}
