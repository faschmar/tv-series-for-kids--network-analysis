{{TD|Steven|*exits the house* Have you seen [[G.U.Y.S.|Ranger Guy]]?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Excuse me?}}
{{TD|Steven|Ranger Guy, one of my "[[G.U.Y.S.]]". You know, ''G.U.Y.S.''? *waves two figurines in his hands*}} 
{{TD||(''Amethyst stares cluelessly. Steven starts explaining in a commercial advertising style.'')}} 
{{TD|Steven|G.U.Y.S.!! Guys, Under, Your, Supervision!! There's Ninja Guy, Construction Guy, Cop Guy, Eye Guy, Invisible Guy, Jagged Guy, Cat Guy, Apple Guy, and my main man, Ranger Guy, the best of all the guys, has gone missing. Have you seen him?}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]|What's that I hear? *exits the house too* You can't find one of your little ''men'' in that super junky room of yours.}}
{{TD|Steven|It's not ''that'' bad.}}
{{TD|Pearl|''A-hem!''}}
{{TD||(''Pearl opens the window of the house, and a seagull, wearing a banana peel on its head and carrying a slice of pizza, flies out from inside.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|How'd that get in there? *shrugs nervously*}}
{{TD|Pearl|You left your window wide open for things to just  fly in and out. *swatting the air*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Aw, give him a break, P. ''My'' room's messy, but I always find what I'm looking for.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Then, why haven't you found my magic axe?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|I haven't looked for it yet.}}
{{TD|Pearl|''Amethyst!'' Go and find it right this ''second.''}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Hey… feel free to go look for it yourself.}}
{{TD|Pearl|There's no way I'm going into that dump!}}

{{TD|Steven|Dad? Daaaddddd!? *is suddenly sprayed with water* Augh! I'm so sorry!}}
{{TD|Greg|Yeah, you're sorry, sorry you walked through that door without a hose in your hand! *approaches Steven* Ready for battle! Aaaah! *continues spraying*}}
{{TD|Steven|Wait! *blocks the nozzle of the hose*}}
{{TD|Greg|Man, you look sad and wet. What happened to your life, little guy?}}
{{TD|Steven|I… lost something… something precious.}}
{{TD|Greg|*gasps* ''Your innocence?!''}}
{{TD|Steven|I lost Ranger Guy. (''Greg stares blankly.'') One of my G.U.Y.S.? From our special day at the beach last summer? You bought him for me at the end of the day. He was one of a kind. He had a miscolored hat, how could you not remember?}}
{{TD|Greg|*scratches his head* Ahh… Was this the same day we ate that awesome funnel cake?}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh… Huh?}}
{{TD|Greg|Yeah, man, that funnel cake. Ha, I even kept the plate. Come on! *signals Steven to follow him*}}
{{TD||(''Greg and Steven walk towards his [[Greg's Van|van]] and he starts searching inside.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*sees balloons flying out of the van* Cool balloons.}}
{{TD|Greg|*begins rummaging the van* Ah, let's see here. Got some cans, napkins, oh, a yo-yo! A book about yo-yo tricks, a sandwich I've been meaning to catch up on. (''Steven flings a nearby marble at Greg's butt.'') Ow, my butt! (''Steven laughs.'') Wait. What's your story again?}}
{{TD|Steven|I lost my special Ranger Guy, and I'm quite upset over it.}}
{{TD|Greg|Huh, well, here's a bag full of quarters. *pushes a nearby bag to Steven* Now you can get all the G.U.Y.S. you want!}}
{{TD|Steven|*gasps and whisper-shouts with starry eyes* Thank you!}}
{{TD|Greg|What'd you say?}}
{{TD|Steven|*yells* '''''THANK YOU!!'''''}}

{{TD||(''Steven stands in front of a line of vending machines, the G.U.Y.S. vending machine, specifically.'')}}

{{TD|Steven|What?!}}
{{TD|G.U.Y.S. Machine|*dispenses a Dave Guy figure in a plastic capsule* Lucky!}}
{{TD|Steven|''Not'' lucky! He's like the worst G.U.Y.! *grabs the dispensed toy* Maybe he comes with something cool. *opens the capsule and takes out a toy tax form prop* Taxes? Come on, Dave Guy, is this all you have to offer? A bunch of paperwork? Answer me! Thank goodness I have all these quarters. *puts another quarter in*}}
{{TD|G.U.Y.S. Machine|Dave Guy!}}
{{TD|Steven|No! *inserts another quarter*}}

{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Suitcase Sam's]}}
{{TD||(''Steven sees Onion entering Suitcase Sam's and observes through the window, as Onion haggles with [[Minor Characters/Humans#Suitcase Sam|Suitcase Sam]].'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, I guess he needs a suitcase? Is he haggling with that guy? He's a tough customer. (''Sam gives Onion a bag.'') Looks like they worked something out. (''Onion exits, Steven realizes the bag is a lunch bag.'') Huh? Did he get that guy's lunch? I wonder how this is gonna play out. *follows Onion*}}

{{TD|Steven|Huh? He's leaving so soon? (''Onion watches his dad leaves.'') Does Onion just... sit around and wait for his dad all day? *gasps and suddenly remembers* Ranger Guy! Okay, let's do this.}}
{{TD||(''Steven approaches Onion on the pier.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Hey, Onion, how are ya? (''Onion shrugs.'') That's good, that's good. I couldn't help but notice that you're a G.U.Y.S. fan. (''Onion stares blankly.'') You know, G.U.Y.S.? The little man in your back pocket? (''Onion pulls out the figurine from his pocket.'') Yeah, Ranger Guy! How would you like to trade that ''boring old'' Ranger Guy for a ''brand spankin' new, mint in box'', Dave Guy?! *pulls out a Dave Guy from bag* Pretty nice, right?}}
{{TD||(''Onion shakes his head and makes a beckoning gesture.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, I see where this is going. You're getting quite the deal here, with TWO Dave Guys! (''Onion shakes his head and beckons for more.'') What? You want more? Like, two more? Five more? Ten more? Twenty more? This whole bag? All thirty of these Dave Guys for just one Ranger Guy. (''Onion just keeps shaking his head and beckoning.'') But there aren't anymore. The machine is empty; I bought them all.}}
{{TD||(''Onion starts walking away.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Where are you going? Hey! Let's work something out! ''Ranger Guuuyyyyy!!''}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Beach House]}}
{{TD||(''Steven returns to the house while Amethyst is still lounging on the porch.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*frustrated* Ugh, stupid Dave Guy. Got no future, your hair cut's gross, you smell bad.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*laughs* You talking about Pearl?}}
{{TD|Steven|No, I'm talking about dumb old Dave Guy. I mean just look at him. *pulls out a Dave Guy* Does it look like his life is going anywhere?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Aw, cut him a break. Maybe this is the year he gets his life together. Maybe he'll get a cool internship.}}
{{TD|Steven|Tsk, I doubt it. I can't even trade thirty Dave Guys with Onion to get ''ONE'' Ranger Guy.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|So you need more of ''that'' little man to get some other little man?}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah, and the machine's sold out of them.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst pulls out a strange wand from her hair.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|What is that?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Pearl's [[Replicator Wand]]. You can use it to make copies of stuff. You're magic, I'm sure you can figure out how to use it.}}
{{TD|Steven|Have you been sitting here all day with this in your hair?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Nah, I got up to look for Pearl's dumb axe but found that instead. Then I replicated a bunch of garbage and stuffed it all in [[Pearl's Room]]. *snickers maliciously*}}

{{TD|[[Garnet]]|That child should not be in possession of such an item.}}

{{TD|Steven|They're called—  *emerges from the pile of Dave Guys* ''G.U.Y.S.!''}}
{{TD|Pearl|Can you please explain this ''mess?!''}}
{{TD|Steven|I traded that Replicator for Ranger Guy.}}

{{TD|Garnet|Let's go before this gets any worse.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet and Pearl leap off.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*sinks, waist-deep, into the pile of Dave Guys* Wah! How do you move in this stuff?}}

{{TD|Steven|I think I understand why you took my Ranger Guy, Onion. I bet you get pretty lonely waiting for your dad all day. (''Onion nods.'') You were probably really bored too. (''Onion nods.'')

You need him more than I do. (''Onion takes the Ranger Guy Steven offers and runs off.'')}}

{{TD|Greg|That was really cool what you did back there.}}
{{TD|Steven|Thanks, Dad.}}
