{{TD|[[Garnet]]| [[Amethyst]].}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *reading a book titled ''[[Minor Objects/Media#Pretty Hairstylist|Pretty Hairstylist]]''* What? I'm busy.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Amethyst, hold down the fort.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *puts down the book and lazily salutes* Aye, aye, Captain. No surprises while ''I'm'' on duty. Wha-!?}}
{{TD||(''[[Connie Maheswaran|Connie]], holding [[Rose's Sword]], suddenly barges through the door with [[Lion]] behind her.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| *excitedly* Surprise! I'm early!}}
{{TD|Steven| ...I was trying to tell you, Connie has sword training today.}}
{{TD|Pearl| *covers her mouth in shock* Oh! I completely forgot... I'm so sorry, Connie..}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *clears her throat tauntingly* ''Very'' irresponsible, Pearl.}}
{{TD||(''Pearl glares and groans at Amethyst.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| Is this because of [[Jasper]]? Are you headed back [[The Great North|North]]?}}
{{TD|Garnet| She's on the move.}}
{{TD|Pearl| We can't have her just out there attacking random monsters for whatever reason.}}
{{TD|Connie| Of course, be safe!}}
{{TD|Pearl| *smiles* That's my line. Amethyst!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Got it.}}
{{TD|Pearl| We'll train next week without Jasper hanging over our heads.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Best case scenario.}}
{{TD||(''Pearl and Garnet warp out.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Lucky break for you guys, you get the training day off. *puts her arm over Connie's shoulder* So what do you wanna do?}}
{{TD||[Open Ext. Beach House]}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie proceed to spar with each other on the beach, with Amethyst sitting and watching them on a hand statue and Lion sleeping in the background. Steven summons his shield as Connie strikes on it with her sword. She strikes again and Steven ducks under, dodging it. He then summons his bubble shield around him, knocking Connie back. Steven summons two shields and throws them in succession at Connie. Connie then counters with her sword, deflecting the shields. Steven gasps as his shields fly back at him and jumps up floating into the air.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| Hey, no fair!}}
{{TD|Steven| *giggles* Hey, Amethyst! Did you see that? Amethyst?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *laying on the rock hand, not paying any attention* S'up.}}
{{TD|Steven| *lands on the ground and walks up to Amethyst* Are you even watching?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Sure, what's it look like?}}
{{TD|Steven| Like you're ''not'' watching?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *sits up* Oh, all right, Y'got me. Ha! *shapeshifts her feet into eyes and lays back down* Is that better?}}
{{TD|Steven & Connie| *laughs* Ewww... Gross!}}
{{TD|Steven| But yeah, that's better. C'mon, Connie *summons his shield* Let's take it from the top!}}
{{TD|Connie| Okay!}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie get in positions, and Connie starts to strike repeatedly at Steven's shield. Amethyst's feet-eyes watch carefully at the two sparring, but quickly gets bored over time and close.'')}}

{{TD|Amethyst| *shapeshifts into Pearl and claps* Excellent! Amazing! ''Pearl''-fect. *giggles*}}
{{TD|Steven| *blushes* Aw, haha... I don't know...}}
{{TD|Connie| Not really, my stance is all wrong, and my grip is a little soft.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *stares at Connie and shapeshifts back to normal* Why are you worried about that little stuff for? It's not gonna matter in a ''real'' fight.}}
{{TD|Connie| It ''does'', though. I ''blew'' it on my first, real magical mission! I was face-to-face with a monster, and I froze. Maybe if I trained a little harder, I... could've handled it.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Sounds to me like you're too in your own head. In a fight, you never know what's gonna happen, You just gotta go with it. How can you get ready when you don't even know what you're getting ready ''for'', huh? *stands up* Yeah, you ''can't'' be ready. What you gotta be is loose. *extends her arms and waves them loosely*}}
{{TD|Steven| *excitedly with starry eyes* I wanna be loose!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Then you gotta go with the flow! Fighting's all about that feeling deep in your ''guts''. What do your ''guts'' feel like!?}}
{{TD||(''Steven's stomach starts to gurgle.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Hungry!?}}
{{TD||(''Connie giggles.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Mine too. *starts chanting* Snack break, snack break, snack break-}}

{{TD|Steven| I do! *throws his hands in the air*}}
{{TD|Connie| Maybe just one! *raises her hand*}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *shapeshifts into [[Lars Barriga|Lars]]* Great! It's on me.}}

{{TD|Amethyst| Heeeey, donut girl. It's me, donut boy. You mind if I grab a couple of krullers? *leans over the counter and push Sadie aside* It's cool, I totally work here! *begins hastily shoving donuts into her back pockets*}}
{{TD|Sadie| *shocked* What the...?}}
{{TD|Steven| Sorry, Sadie. That's just Amethyst being Amethyst... by not being Amethyst... *shrugs with a fake smile on his face*}}
{{TD|Sadie| Oh, it's no problem, Steven. It's just a couple of donuts.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst turns around and walk out of the stop, carrying bundles of donut-filled bags in her arms.'')}}

Amethyst points and laughs at Steven while Connie looks disgusted. Amethyst then shakes her own can and hits herself in the face with a soda geyser, causing her to fall backwards off the bench. Steven and Connie look at her, and begin laughing together.'')}}

{{TD|Amethyst| In the heat of battle, you're not gonna ''have'' a swimsuit, Connie!}}
{{TD|Connie| By Jove I guess you're right! *runs into the ocean up to Steven, laughing* I don't think I've ever had this much fun in one day!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *surfing across the water in the background* Bungacowa!}}
{{TD|Steven| We should spend more time with Amethyst, she's the best!}}

{{TD|Connie| Amethyst, that was amazing!}}
{{TD|Steven| Whoa, are you okay?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *sighs* Not a pretty win, but I'll take it.}}

{{TD|Jasper| I came here to fight Rose, not some ''runt!''}}
{{TD|Amethyst| You think you can just keep showing up and picking fights with us? Agh, why don't you get a ''life!?''}}
{{TD|Jasper| Fighting ''IS'' my life! It's what I was made for! *points at Amethyst* It's what you were made for too, runt!}}

{{TD|Jasper| *towering over Amethyst* You're not even trying! Is it because you know you're ''already'' a failure? (''Amethyst looks up at her.'') You're a quartz soldier, just like me. *disgusted* But you're not like me, are you?}}
