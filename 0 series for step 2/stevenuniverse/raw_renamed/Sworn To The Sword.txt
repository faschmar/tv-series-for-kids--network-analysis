{{TD|Steven| *playing his ukulele* ♫ The sun is bright, our shirts are clean. / We're sitting up above the sea. / Come on and share this jam with me. ♫}}

{{TD|Steven| ♫ And I'll keep it fresh, I'm jamming on these tasty preserves! ♫}} 
{{TD|Steven & Connie| ♫ Ingredients in harmony, we mix together perfectly, come on and share this jam with me! ♫}} 
{{TD|Steven| WOO-HOO! Jam buds!}} 
{{TD|Connie| Nice jam session! *puts her violin back in the case*}} 
{{TD|Steven| Don't forget the best part!}} 
{{TD||(''Steven spreads some strawberry jam on a biscuit and prepares to eat it, when a flock of seagulls approaches and growls at Steven. Steven screams and flinches, when he sees Connie using her violin bow to fend them off.'')}} 
{{TD|Connie| Yah! Hah! Hi-yah! Run back to your masters! Tell them we're not afraid of your kind!}} 
{{TD|Steven| *giggles* Thanks for saving my jam snack. Unfortunately, it's not safe from me. *eats the jam snack* You're such a good sword fighter, Connie.}} 
{{TD|Connie| Really? *glances at her violin bow* I was just swinging this thing around. I don't really know what I'm doing, but I'd love to learn how to use a real sword!}} 
{{TD|Steven| Oh! *swallows the snack and gets starry eyes* Steven has an idea!}} 
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Beach House]]]}} 
{{TD|[[Pearl]]| You want me to do ''what?''}} 
{{TD|Steven| You should teach Connie to sword-fight, she's already so good!}} 
{{TD|Connie| *blushes* ''Steven!''}} 
{{TD|Steven| But you are! You helped me fight the [[Robot Shooty Thing|robot floaty-thing]], she took down that [[Cloud Connie|evil clone of herself]], uh... those mean seagulls just now...}} 
{{TD|Pearl| You're awfully young to begin something like this. But, I suppose I was only a few thousand years old when I began fighting alongside [[Rose Quartz]].}} 
{{TD||(''Connie raises her hand for Pearl's attention.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| Yes, Connie?}} 
{{TD|Connie| Please, I wanna learn! *blushes* I mean, I don't know what'll happen in the future, but if something dangerous comes along, I don't wanna be a burden, I wanna help! I wanna be there for Steven, to fight by his side! The [[Earth]] is my home too, can't I help protect it?}} 
{{TD|Pearl| *touched with tears of joy* Oh... Okay...! *stands up and wipes away her tears* If that's how you feel, we should get started! *walks off*}} 
{{TD|Steven| Woo-hoo! *follows Pearl*}} 
{{TD|Connie| Wait, ''now?''}} 
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[Ancient Sky Arena]]]}} 
{{TD||(''Pearl, Steven, and Connie arrive on the [[Warp Pad]] just outside the main arena. Pearl is carrying a sword that Connie will use for her training. Connie, initially floating above the Warp Pad, falls on top of it and giggles.'')}}

{{TD|Connie| WOO!}} 
{{TD||(''Connie almost falls over again, continuing to laugh, and Steven grabs her to keep her from falling over.'')}} 
{{TD|Pearl| *on the steps* Hey, you two, this way!}} 
{{TD|Connie| *turns to Steven* Race you!}} 
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie run up the steps towards the main arena, laughing along the way. Pearl walks in front of them, until they all arrive at the entrance to the main arena.'')}} 
{{TD|Connie| Woah!}} 
{{TD|Pearl| This is an Ancient Sky Arena, Connie, where some of the first battles for Earth took place. It was here that I became familiar with the human concept of being a knight, completely dedicated to a person and a cause. *presents Connie with a sword* This is what you must become, Connie; brave, selfless, loyal... a knight! We begin with a bow, first to me, your teacher.}} {{TD||(''Pearl bows to Connie, and Connie returns a slight bow back.'')}} 
{{TD|Pearl| And now again, to your liege.}} 
{{TD|Connie| Okay! *turns to Steven and kneels to him* My liege.}} 
{{TD|Steven| *bows back* Miss Knight.}} 
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie begin giggling under their breath.'')}} 
{{TD|Pearl| I hope you two are taking this seriously.}} 
{{TD|Connie| Yes, ma'am!}} 
{{TD|Steven| Mmhm, mmhm.}} 
{{TD||(''Pearl's gem begins to glow, summoning a [[Holo-Pearl]], causing Steven to grimace a bit.'')}} 
{{TD|Connie| Cool, hologram Pearl!}} 
{{TD|Pearl| To begin, this Holo-Pearl will be your opponent.}}

{{TD||(''Steven walks off towards the stands nervously. Pearl walks up to Connie and places her right hand on Connie's sword arm, guiding its movement, and her left hand on Connie's shoulder. Holo-Pearl then walks up and crosses swords with Connie.'')}}

{{TD||(''Pearl begins to sings "[[Do It for Her]]".'') }}

{{TD|Connie| ♫ Keep my stance wide. ♫}} 
{{TD|Pearl| Good.}}

{{TD|Pearl| Right.}} 
{{TD|Connie| ♫ As I'm moving forward... ♫}} 
{{TD|Pearl| Concentrate! Don't you want him to live?!}} 
{{TD||(''Connie faces off with a higher-level Holo-Pearl. She momentarily loses her focus and Pearl chides her, while Steven watches in worry.'')}}

{{TD|Pearl| Yes, but put your whole body into it! ♫ Everything you have, / Everything you are, / You've got to give— ♫}} 
{{TD||(''Connie regains her stance and dodge Holo-Pearl's attacks, continuing to spar off with it, as Steven keeps watching with fingers crossed.'')}}

{{TD||(''One night, Pearl projects a hologram and tells Connie and Steven a tale of the [[Gem Battlefield]]: Pearl was running through the chaotic battlefield when she spotted an [[Unknown Gems|unknown Gem]] is about to attack [[Rose Quartz]].

{{TD|Connie| ♫ Deep down, I know, / That I'm just a human. ♫}} 
{{TD|Pearl| True.}} 
{{TD|Pearl & Connie| ♫ But you know that you can draw your sword and fight. ♫}} 
{{TD||(''Connie's appearance changes drastically, as she dons on a new training outfit and her sword-fighting skill progressively gets better.'')}}

{{TD|Steven| Connie, wait!}} 
{{TD|Connie| Huh?}} 
{{TD||(''The door to [[Pearl's Room]] opens, and Pearl walks out.'')}} 
{{TD|Pearl| Ah, right on time.}} 
{{TD|Steven| Can we talk for a moment?}} 
{{TD|Connie| Sure. What's up?}} 
{{TD|Pearl| We have important training to do, Connie.}}

{{TD|Amethyst| Yo, Steven. ''Why are you standing there all '''SAD''' like that!?''}} 
{{TD|Steven| W-Well, Connie is taking sword fighting lessons from Pearl, but I think it's getting a little too serious. She wants Connie to do all this dangerous stuff for me. (''Amethyst and Garnet look at each other with concern.'')}} 
{{TD|Garnet| That makes sense.}} 
{{TD|Steven| What do you mean?}} 
{{TD|Garnet| *kneels back before Steven* Back during [[The Rebellion|the war]], Pearl took pride in risking her destruction for your mother. She put Rose Quartz over everything; over logic, over consequence, over her own life.}}

{{TD|Connie| This is much easier!}} 
{{TD|Steven| That's the idea!}} 
{{TD||(''Steven then forms his bubble shield and pushes all the Holo-Pearls away, causing them to shatter and dissipate.'')}} 
{{TD|Steven| No matter what comes, we do this together!}} 
{{TD|Pearl| STEVEN!}}

{{TD|Connie| Did Rose make you feel like you were nothing?}}
