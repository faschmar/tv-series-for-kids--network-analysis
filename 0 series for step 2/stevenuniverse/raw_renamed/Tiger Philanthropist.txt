{{TD||[Open Int. [[Abandoned Warehouse]]]}}
{{TD||(''A wrestling match is ongoing inside of the warehouse. A crowd is cheering while Mr. Smiley is emceeing, as [[Purple Puma]] and [[Tiger Millionaire (alter ego)|Tiger Millionaire]] take on [[Minor_Characters/Humans#Shark-O-Mania|Shark-O-Mania]]'')}}
{{TD|[[Harold Smiley|Mr. Smiley]]|They're the team you love to hate, but also hate to love!}}
{{TD|[[Lars]]|I love wrestling!}}
{{TD||(''Purple Puma and Tiger Millionaire attack Shark-O-Mania off-screen, knocking him into a daze.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley| Ooh, another devastating move by Purple Puma and Tiger Millionaire tonight folks! Looks like Shark-O-Mania is seeing starfish after that last one!}}
{{TD|[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]|Let's finish him off with our special move!}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]|Yeah, why not?}}
{{TD|Steven|Take my hand!}}
{{TD||(''Purple Puma grabs Tiger Millionaire's hand and spins him in the air.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Here it comes, ya'll! The ''PURPLE MILLIONAIRE KICK''!}}
{{TD||(''Purple Puma swings Tiger Millionaire around and he kicks Shark-O Mania in the face, knocking him down onto his back.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|And Shark-O-Mania's out cold. Somebody put that fish on ice before it stinks up the joint!}}
{{TD||(''Purple Puma, seemingly in solemn, gazes down at Shark-O Mania on the ground, and then at the cheering crowd.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Folks, Tiger Millionaire and Purple Puma have done it again! They are ''still'' your tag team champions! Will their special brand of jungle terror ever come to an end? }}
{{TD||(''The crowd cheers on loudly, including Lars.'')}}
{{TD|Lars|Yeah! Don't ever stop!}}
{{TD|Steven|Tiger Millionaire and Purple Puma forever!}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Such dedication to teamwork! And friendship- Wha!?}}
{{TD||(''Purple Puma climbs out of the wrestling ring and swipes away Mr. Smiley microphone.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *sighs* Hey, it's been fun, but... I'm over this.}}
{{TD||(''The crowd gasps in shock, and goes silent.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Wha- What's going on?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| I'm ''through'' with this place! Here's your belt back. *drops the mic*}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Hey now, that mic is expensive! You can't just-}}
{{TD||(''Purple Puma removes her tag team belt around her waist and drops it on the ground too.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Oh, no, you're just gonna do that and leave?!}}
{{TD||(''Tiger Millionaire runs over and picks up the belt and the microphone, as he watches Purple Puma leave the warehouse'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh, sorry everyone. I guess... this is over. Bye, Mr. Smiley}}
{{TD||(''Tiger Millionaire returns the microphone back to Mr. Smiley and follows after Purple Puma. The crowd begins protesting and booing.''}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|What an unbelievable shame, folks.}}
{{TD|Lars|What! That's ''it''?! You can't quit now!}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|What a sad and anti-climatic end to one of the greatest tag team careers to ever grace the squared surface.}}
{{TD||(''The warehouse door closes behind Purple Puma and Tiger Millionaire, and Purple Puma shapeshifts back into her normal form.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Aaahh...! Got my Saturday night spank.}}
{{TD|Steven|Did you really mean what you said? About being through with wrestling?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Come on, Steven. Wasn't that match kinda boring? Pfft, we don't need ''wrestling'' to have fun anymore, right?}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh, right!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Yeah! Let's go home and get some grub.}}
{{TD||(''Tiger Millionaire looks at the belt that Purple Puma dropped in slight dismay.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. The [[Big Donut]], The Next Day]}}
{{TD||(''Steven walks into the Big Donut to get some donuts.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Hey Sadie, hey Lars! Can I get the special?}}
{{TD||(''Lars, face-down on the counter, drops Steven's order on the counter without saying a word.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*picks up his order* Uhh...}}
{{TD||(''Steven lifts up Lars' head, revealing his distressed face.'')}}
{{TD|Lars|*groaning* Tiger...}}
{{TD||(''Steven yells in shock and lets off of Lars' head, flopping it back on the counter.'')}}
{{TD|Lars|... He left wrestling at the height of his career! *groaning* Why...?}}
{{TD|[[Sadie]]|Huh, why don't you just ask Steven?}}
{{TD|Lars|You and your theory. Steven is ''not'' Tiger! Tiger's ripped and like seven feet tall!}}
{{TD|Steven|Well... I heard Purple Puma didn't want to do it anymore}}
{{TD|Lars|So what!? Just because Purple Puma quit doesn't mean Tiger had to.}}
{{TD|Steven|*gets pensive* I also heard Tiger didn't think of that.}}
{{TD|Lars|Well, he shoulda. It's the least he could do for his fans.}}
{{TD|Steven|Hmm... *leaves the shop, deep in thought*}}
{{TD|Sadie|O-uh. It ''is'' him, right?}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Abandoned Warehouse, Night-time]}}
{{TD||(''Steven runs towards the warehouse, wearing a shawl, as another wrestling match is occurring.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Now I know these days we are in a depression. But underground wrestling is too big to fade. We got ''two'' new fighters on loan and they are here to collect. Ladies and gentlemen, The Wolves of Wallstreet!}}
{{TD||(''The crowd cheers as two wrestlers, similar in theme of Purple Puma and Tiger Millionaire, but as wolves, are seen on the wrestling ring.'')}}
{{TD|[[Minor_Characters/Humans#Billy_Bank_Assets|Billy Bank Assets]]|We'll huff! We'll puff! And we'll ''blow'' your stocks down!}}
{{TD|Lars|What a ripoff.}}
{{TD||(''Steven bursts through the warehouse door and jumps to the ring.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|What's this? It looks like we have a new challenger making his way into the ring. What mystery could possibly lie beneath that identity-concealing shawl?}}
{{TD||(''Steven, dressed as Tiger Millionaire, removes his shawl, and his [[Purple_Puma_and_Tiger_Millionaire|wrestling theme]] begins to play.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|I don't believe! Tiger Millionaire, ladies and gentlemen!}}
{{TD||(''Lars chokes on his drink in surprise, and the crowd cheers on in shock too. Tiger Millionaire then picks the microphone.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|You are wrong Mr. Smiley. Tiger Millionaire, is ''gone'' forever. He retired to his huge pile of money. But he realized it didn't make him happy. So here I am ready to give back to the fans. Tiger Philanthropist!}}
{{TD||(''Tiger Philanthropist rips off his tie and starts throwing money to a very excited crowd. Sadie is confused while Lars is unamused.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley| So the millionaire becomes a philanthropist. A person who gives money away! But I ask you. Can the Purple Puma's backup make it solo?}}
{{TD|Steven|Bring it on!}}
{{TD||(''The crowd cheers as Tiger Philanthropist prepares to face Billy Bank Assets.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Hey, tough boy! You need a loan to start a small business?}}
{{TD|Billy Bank Assets|Oh. I'm actually pretty financially stable-}}
{{TD|Steven|'Cause you've just been approved.}}
{{TD|Billy Bank Assets|But I guess that-}}
{{TD||(''Tiger charges at Billy with an elbow strike and knocks him down.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Oh my dang! Billy Bank Assets just got a taste of the Philanthropist business loan elbow!}}
{{TD||(''[[Minor_Characters/Humans#Howl_Jones|Howl Jones]] jumps into the ring in front of Tiger.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Howl Jones is still in this match thought! He's gonna make a withdraw!}}
{{TD||(''Howl Jones grapples Tiger at his shoulders, but Tiger flips him overhead.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Oh! Overdraft!}}
{{TD|Steven|This should cover your medical bills! *throws money at Howl Jones*}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|What a generous wrestler! Oh-what? Looks like Shark-o-Mania is back for revenge! With a new partner! The [[Minor_Characters/Humans#Sea_Wasp|Sea-Wasp]]! *checking on his phone* Which is a very poisonous type of jellyfish.}}
{{TD||(''Shark-O-Mania and Sea Wasp jump into the ring and approach Tiger Philanthropist.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Ha! Looks like we'll have to give them the old Purple Pum-}}
{{TD||(''Tiger holds his hand out and looks behind, and realizes Purple Puma is not there anymore.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Dang! How is Tiger gonna get out off this fishy situation?}}
{{TD|Steven|Ahhhh}}
{{TD||(''Tiger charges at Shark-o-Mania and Sea-Wasp and takes them both down with an arm to their guts.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Oh! He hit 'em with a charitable Take-Donation! And now a wringing-catapultist!}}
{{TD||(''Tiger single-handedly knocks out Shark-o-Mania and Sea-Wasp.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Did you see that? He's paying for their medical bills too! It looks like this philanthropist is the real deal, ladies and gentlemen! No one is leaving here tonight unimpressed.}}
{{TD||(''Tiger Philanthropist climbs onto the ring rope and throws more money at the cheering crowd. He then looks at Lars, noticing a look of disinterest on his face, and frowns in dismay.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. The Big Donut, The Next Day]}}
{{TD||(''Steven visits the donut shop again to greet Lars.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*cheery* Hi Lars!}}
{{TD|Lars|*deadpan* Uhh... What.}}
{{TD|Steven|So... how was your evening?}}
{{TD|Lars|Fine I guess. Kind of boring.}}
{{TD|Steven|What do you mean kind of boring!?}}
{{TD|Lars|Why are ''you'' so worked up over how ''my'' night was?}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, uhh... Well, I was wondering if you've seen any good wrestling matches lately?}}
{{TD|Lars|Hmpf. Now that you mention it, no!}}
{{TD|Steven|But I heard Tiger Millionaire was back. He's your favorite, right?}}
{{TD|Lars|Yeah, but he came back as some lame, Tiger... Phil-harmonic donations-thing? Which, honestly, is such a ''weird'' angle, you know? The whole thing just felt so ''off''.}}
{{TD|Steven|What do you mean ''off''?}}
{{TD|Lars| He took off his tie, and is throwing money at everybody. It's like, the sequel no one asked for.}}
{{TD|Steven|What! It's the sequel you asked for!}}
{{TD|Lars|Well, he just didn't seem into it, you know? He used to ''care'' about his money. Now he's just giving it away. And he still just wins like, every match.}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, I get it. You want him to lose and keep his money, right?}}
{{TD|Lars|No, I don't want him to lose, just-}}
{{TD|Steven|What do you want him to do!? Just tell ''meeeee!''}}
{{TD|Lars|I don't know! I don't even know what I want for breakfast half the time! I'm a complex individual teenage boy. Now get out of here and stop taking such a personal interest in my habits and well-being!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Beach House]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven lies sulking on the couch, while Amethyst is making tea next to him.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|I don't get it. I don't even know why I'm wrestling anymore. I guess I'm doing it for Lars? And he doesn't even care. I liked it better when I was doing it for you.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|But who needs it, you know? I mean, I needed it when I felt like, ehh... I wasn't good enough. But I don't feel like that anymore. *eats the teabag* Do you?}}
{{TD|Steven|No. No, that- that's never why I was doing it. I just, liked it was our thing we did together. But, you're right. Doesn't make sense anymore. I think I should just do what you did. Just tell everybody I'm quitting and... leave like it's no big deal.}}
{{TD||(''Steven gets up and walks off. Amethyst looks down in slight regret.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Abandoned Warehouse, Night-time]}}
{{TD||(''Tiger Philanthropist stands alone in the ring, with the tag team belts hanging from the ceiling.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Ladies and gents. Tonight is a very special night here at the Beach City Wrestling Arena Dome and Building. I'll let my good friend Tiger Mill- I mean, Philanthropist explain.}}
{{TD|Steven|Thank you Mr. Smiley.}}
{{TD|Lars|*uninterested* What now?}}
{{TD|Steven|Tonight will mark my greatest and finalist act of philanthropy. Tonight, I am giving away the Tag Team titles. Whoever can grab them first can have them.}}
{{TD||(''The crowd begins booing at Tiger.'')}}
{{TD|Lars|''Booooo!'' Philanthrophy is laaame!}}
{{TD|Steven|Boo all you like! I don't care anymore! These belts don't mean anything to me! They never did.}}
{{TD||(''The crowd keep booing at Tiger, when the Brothers Construction theme starts to play.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|I know that sound! It's the Brothers Construction! [[Minor_Characters/Humans#Concrete_Heat|Concrete Heat]] and [[Minor_Characters/Humans#Chunk_Truck|Chunk Truck]]! So sad to see Tiger giving up those belts without at least putting up a fight.}}
{{TD||(''The Good-Looking Gang theme plays as they enter the warehouse as well.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Oh no! It's Good-Looking Gang's music! They are back to finally claim the tag titles! Look like things are heating up on the ring, who'll be the next tag team champion!}}
{{TD||(''A Puma's Roar is suddenly heard, as Purple Puma appears at the doorway.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Whoa there, Tiger!}}
{{TD|Steven|Amethyst?}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|He's ''back!'' The legend has returned to the ring! '''PUUURPPPLE PUUUMAAA!!'''}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Those belts aren't yours to give away! Those times we wrestled together meant everything to me! *jumps into the ring* You can give away all jungle bucks you want. But I will not stand by and let you give up our ''memories!''}}
{{TD||(''Purple Puma picks up Tiger Philanthropist and hugs him. The crowds "awws" and cheers.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Oh what a display, ladies and gentlemen.}}
{{TD|Steven|You came back!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|I'm sorry. This was our thing we did together and I just... quit on you!}}
{{TD|Steven|It's ok. You were right. We don't need this anymore.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Well, how do you wanna go out?}}
{{TD|Steven|With a bang!}}
{{TD||(''Purple Puma and Tiger Philanthropist smile at each other, when Chunk Truck suddenly punches Purple Puma in the face.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|It looks like this fight for the belt it's still on!}}
{{TD||(''Purple Puma stumbles backwards and leans onto the ring ropes. Chunk Truck then grapples Tiger Philanthropist, leaving him open for Concrete Heat.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|The Brothers Construction look like they are ready letting down a foundation of pain! But, oh! Shark-o-Mania is back again! He's not even in the match!}}
{{TD||(''Shark-o-Mania jumps into the ring and charges at Tiger, headbutting him while still in Chuck Truck's grasp.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|Tiger Philanthropist is down!}}
{{TD|Lars|What?!}}
{{TD||(''Shark-o-Mania and Concrete Heat grab and knock down Tiger Philanthropist and Purple Puma respectively. As they stand up, Chunk Truck punches Tiger, and Concrete Heat executes a Double Axe Handle on Puma.'')}}
{{TD|Lars|*climbing into the ring* This isn't fair! Stop the match! They're gonna be destroyed!}}
{{TD||(''A security guard grabs Lars and drags him away. Puma and Tiger kneel beaten-up in front of the Good-Looking Gang.'')}}
{{TD|Steven & Amethyst|Finish it!}}
{{TD||(''The Good-Looking Gang nod and they both deliver a kick right into Puma's and Tiger's face, knocking them out.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|No! The Good-Looking Gang hit the Star-Crossed Lovers on Puma and Tiger! This is their chance! The belts are hanging free and clear!}}
{{TD||(''Puma and Tiger gaze at the Good-Looking Gang as they successfully retrieve the tag team belts, and pink and purple confetti begin raining upon them.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Smiley|They got it! It's official! The Good-Looking Gang are the new Beach City underground tag team wrestling champions! This is truly the end for Tiger Millionaire and Purple Puma. What a way to go out!}}
{{TD||(''Sadie keeps the warehouse door open, as the security guard escorts Lars outside the building.'')}}
{{TD|Lars|How can this be happening! It was just getting good! You can't quit now! '''TIIIGEEERR!!''' *sobs*}}
{{TD||(''The star iris closes on Puma and Tiger, as they wink at each other in content, ending the episode.'')}}
