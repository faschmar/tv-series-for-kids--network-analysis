*'''[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]''': This RPGs is amazing. I'm gonna play non stop until I beat this game. Never mind. The gems are back.
*'''[[Garnet]]''': Hello, Steven.
*'''Steven''': What is that?
*'''[[Pearl]]''': This is an ancient gem weapon. In the hands of the powerful gem. It could be use to command entire army of light.
*'''Steven''': Cool. Can I see?
*'''Pearl''': Oh, no. Absolutely not. It's very dangerous. Well, in the hands of the powerful gem anyway.
*'''[[Amethyst]]''': But, in the hands of Steven. Eh, not so much.
*'''Steven''': Yeah. Me, no powerful.
*'''Garnet''': Alright. Be careful.
*'''Pearl''': Steven, stay back. Oh, no. Now the light is light creatures are loose in the world. We must work together to track them down and return them to the Prism!
*'''Steven''': Or heres. Teaming up for magic adventure. This is the greatest RPG ever! Ahhh, scorpions!
*'''Pearl''': Those aren't ordinary scorpions! The light from the Prism has taken their form!
*'''Garnet''': Steven, we must exterminate these creatures.
*'''Steven''': O-okay, let's do it! Woooah, that was so cool!
*'''Garnet''': Thanks, Garnet.
*'''Amethyst''': Hey Steven, check this out.
*'''Steven''': Nice, Amethyst!!
*'''Amethyst''': Hoo yeah!! These Prism guys don't stand a chance!!
*'''Steven''': Hey guys, let me help! Pearl, you can do it!
*'''Pearl''': Aw, thanks for the encouragement, Steven!
*'''Steven''': That was easy peasy! Guys... GUYS! Is that... IS THAT!?
*'''Amethyst''': Geez, Steven, you act like you've never seen a treasure chest before!
*'''Steven''': I can't believe it... It's... so beautiful!
*'''Garnet''': Steven, tell me what you want to do.
*'''Steven''': Let's open this bad boy!
*'''Garnet''': That's a spirit. Give it a tap.
*'''Steven''': Hooray for treasure!!
*'''Garnet''': Hmm...
*'''Pearl''': Oh my, a refracted light barrier! The Prism creatures are beginning to corrupt these caves...
*'''Steven''': It looks like a locked door! That means... There must be a secret key!
*'''Pearl''': That's right, Steven! Let's go find it.
*'''Steven''': So cool... More scorpion light guys! I've got just the thing...
*'''Amethyst''': Check out that goofy lookin' rock! It looks just like Pearl! Haha!
*'''Steven''': It does resemble Pearl's profile!
*'''Amethyst''': Oooh, burn! Hahaha!
*'''Pearl''': When you two are finished, maybe we should take a closer look at that rock?
*'''Steven''': OH YEAH! Super secret key!! Thanks, Pearl-shaped rock!
*'''Pearl''': Um... right. Steven, let's make our way back to that locked barrier!
*'''Steven''': This really is just like an RPG!
*'''Pearl''': What are these "Are Pee Gees" you keep mentioning?
*'''Steven''': Oh man, Role Playing Games! You go on these, like, cool quests... And you explore caves, and fight baddies, and get treasure... And level up, and!!
*'''Amethyst''': How that does sound like what we do!
*'''Steven''': Whoa! This guy looks tough!
*'''Garnet''': Leave it to me.
*'''Steven''': Woah, look at this big triangle lady!
*'''Pearl''': Wow, Steven, that looks like an Ancient Prism Idol! Let's see, it should have a special activation procedure...
*'''Amethyst''': Try giving it a smack!
*'''Pearl''': Ugh, don't be ridiculous...
*'''Amethyst''': What do you think, Steven?
*'''Steven''': Hmmm. What if we just say hi?
*'''Pearl''': That's a much more sensible solution, Steven!
*'''Amethyst''': Booooo!
*'''Steven''': Another light barrier... But we've used up all our keys!
*'''Garnet''': Tricky.
*'''Steven''': Guys, wait! It seems like there's something funky going on with that wall... A super secret hidden room?! I've always wanted to find one of these!
*'''Garnet''': We'll have to keep our eyes out for secret rooms from now on.
*'''Pearl''': Steven, you found a healing pool!
*'''Amethyst''': Great, this big ugly wall in totally in our way!
*'''Pearl''': There's no ordinary wall, this is...
*'''Steven''': A super secret and mysterious puzzle wall?!!
*'''Pearl''': Well... Yes, essentially...
*'''Amethyst''': Time to use that big brain of yours!
*'''Steven''': Alright! Watch out, puzzle wall, you're 'bout to get solved! It's elementary, you see... we just need to... Um... uh... Put thingies in the slots!
*'''Amethyst''': Nice job, super sleuth!
*'''Garnet''': We have to find them first. Let's start looking.
*'''Steven''': Just a super secret treasure, no big deal! Oh man, another secret room! Guys, I bet you didn't know this was here!
*'''Amethyst''': Haha, no one can sniff 'em out like you can, Steven!
*'''Steven''': If you need secret room finding, I'm your man! Yes, super secret gemstone!! Nicely done, Steven! We did it! Hooray for puzzle-solving teamwork!
*'''Amethyst''': Oh man, another one?!
*'''Steven''': Hey! This one has red slots! So... we just need to find red stones?
*'''Garnet''': We won't find red gemstones in these caves.
*'''Steven''': But then how will we know what amazing secrets lie on the other side?!
*'''Garnet''': We'll just have to come back later.
*'''Steven''': Aw man... Guys! Look how little this one is! I think it's a baby! C'mere lil' baby scorpion monster... aren't you cute...
*'''Garnet''': Steven! Look out!
*'''Steven''': Whhooooooahhh! Oh no! We will avenge you, baby scorpion monster!
*'''Pearl''': Steven, this is it! We must return the [[Indigo Light]] to the Prism!
*'''Amethyst''': Pfffft, this is nothing! Let's squash this big bug!
*'''Steven''': Whoa... We got him!
*'''Garnet''': Nice job, Steven!
*'''Steven''': One color down... six to go! Our quest continues! Hey... My cheeseburger backpack feels lighter for some reason... Oh man!! All our stuff is gone!
*'''Amethyst''': Wow, bummer...
*'''Pearl''': Something about the light in this area... It looks like we can't bring in anything from outside.
*'''Steven''': Nooooo, items!! We hardly knew you!
*'''Amethyst''': Don't be a doof. I'm sure they'll be back when we leave.
*'''Garnet''': Stay focused. This area is more dangerous than the rest.
*'''Steven''': Look at all those strawberries... Hey! We've been here before!
*'''Pearl''': That's right, Steven! Do you remember the history of this place?
*'''Steven''': It was a Gem Battlefield!
*'''Pearl''': That's exactly right! I'm impressed, Steven! Steven, do you have to dig through the dirt? You're getting filthy...
*'''Steven''': The first rule of RPGs... treasure can be anywhere! Uh oh, another boss-looking boss guy!
*'''Pearl''': Is that... me?!
*'''Amethyst''': Welp, looks like we need to beat you up, Pearl!
*'''Pearl''': Amethyst!
*'''Garnet''': She's right. Gems, weapons!
*'''Pearl''': Well, that was... something.
*'''Garnet''': We haven't seen the last of that creature.
*'''Pearl''': Ah, to think of the Gem battles waged here thousands of years ago... Doesn't it just fill with you nostalgia, Garnet?
*'''Garnet''': Yes.
*'''Steven''': Another puzzle dealie wall! But this one's different... What's with thos crazy symbols? Hm, where's that handy rock with all the symbols. Hey! Is that... one of the lights from the Prism? It's cute!
*'''Pearl''': Stay back, Steven! These creatures are formed from dangerous Gem technology!
*'''Steven''': Dangerous things can be cute... Um... Guys... Is it suppose to make noises like that??
*'''Garnet''': Steven, quick! Hold up the Prism.
*'''Steven''': W-wait! What if it wants to be friends??
*'''Pearl''': That's a sweet thought, Steven... But... impossible, unfortunately.
*'''Garnet''': Steven, we must contain it. The Prism!
*'''Steven''': O-okay, one prism, coming right up! Sorry, lil guy...
*'''Pearl''': It's okay, Steven. We have to contain them to keep the world safe.
*'''Steven''': Yeah, I know. Okay, that's two colors down! Whoa, that's one big beetle!
*'''Amethyst''': Pffft, he ain't nothin'. Let's rip 'em up!
*'''Steven''': Yeah! Let's mash his potatoes!
*'''Amethyst''': Alright! Let's get him!
*'''Steven''': Phew, journeying across battlefields, fighting light creatures... Just another day at the office for the Crystal Gems! I should let the Crystal Gems know how great they're doing... Amethyst, you're rocking it!
*'''Amethyst''': Haha, you're in a good mood, Steven!
*'''Steven''': You know it! Attacking the light with my buds, what's not to love!
*'''Pearl''': This time it's taken from Amethyst's form.
*'''Amethyst''': Hey! Quit copying me!
*'''Steven''': Hey, you! Green light plant guy! Yeah, you! Stop taking the forms of my friends!
*'''Garnet''': Gems, don't hold back!
*'''Steven''': Yes! Time for secrets! Guys!! We found a new secret area!
*'''Amethyst''': Haha, well yeah, this is what we do!
*'''Steven''': I'm just so proud of us! Woah, this place is new! So you'll think we'll find more light guys here?
*'''Garnet''': Yes. I've been tracking them.
*'''Steven''': Well, that's handy dandy! Hey guys, I was thinking... Seeing as how we're on a super serious important mission and all... Maybe it would be a good time to have you guys...I dunno... FORM A FUSION GEM?!
*'''Pearl''': Steven, you know we only fuse when it's absolutely necessary.
*'''Amethyst''': Haha, nice try!
*'''Steven''': Was worth a shot...
*'''Amethyst''': Wow, Steven... Are you really looking for treasure in those bones?
*'''Steven''': I'm sorry, Mr. Skeleton! Ooh, a three way split! Which way to go...
*'''Amethyst''': Right is always WRONG! Let's go left!
*'''Pearl''': Knowing tour track record, we're better off heading right.
*'''Garnet''': You're both wrong. Straight ahead is the correct choice.
*'''Amethyst''': Pffft, what do you think, Steven?
*'''Steven''': Um... I say straight!
*'''Garnet''': Good choice.
*'''Steven''': Yes, super secret gemstone!! Nicely done, Steven! OH NO!!!
*'''Pearl''': Steven, what is it?
*'''Steven''': The dragonfly! It just looks... So tough! I think it might be the KING OF ALL DRAGONFLIES!
*'''Amethyst''': Okat, Steven has lost it.
*'''Steven''': No, I'm serious! We're clearly no match for him! This could be the end!! UNLESS...
*'''Pearl''': Steven, we're not fusing.
*'''Amethyst''': Ugh, no way!
*'''Pearl''': He's too strong! Steven, stay back!
*'''Steven''': Oh no! Don't give up guys! You can do it if you work together!!
*'''Garnet''': Steven's right... We need to synchronize.
*'''Amethyst''': Are you saying what I think you're saying?
*'''Garnet''': That's right! Gems... fuse up!
*'''Steven''': Whoa, are we... under water? Something about this place seems familiar...
*'''Amethyst''': Haha, you should remember it! You had a hand in making it sink!
*'''Steven''': Wait a minute... is this the lunar sea spire??
*'''Amethyst''': Not so lunar now...
*'''Steven''': It wasn't on... PORPOISE!
*'''Amethyst''': Ahahaha! Steven, you're a riot!
*'''Steven''': Another one of those guys!!
*'''Amethyst''': Niiice! Steven, do your Prism thang!
*'''Steven''': Hey! It ran off! Come back lil guy!
*'''Garnet''': Gems, let's move!
*'''Steven''': My, you're a tricky one!
*'''[[Light Prism|Light Gem]]''': Why......
*'''Steven''': What the heck! Did you just... speak??
*'''Pearl''': Steven, hurry, before it gets away again!
*'''Steven''': Wait! I think it's trying to communicate!
*'''Garnet''': Steven, now!
*'''Steven''': Okay... here goes... Sorry little guy... I'll keep you safe in here... Wow, this place looks dangerous. It's a good thing my Dad doesn't know I'm adventuring in a place like this...
*'''Amethyst''': Haha, yeah, [[Greg Universe|Greg]] would flip his wig!
*'''Pearl''': This is it. The red light is the last color missing from the Prism.
*'''Steven''': Let's wrap this up and then go out for pizzas!
*'''Amethyst''': Ooh, or burritos!
*'''Steven''': Let's get both!!
*'''Amethyst''': Now you're talkin'!
*'''Steven''': Hey, it's the big pointy Prism guy!
*'''Pearl''': Wow, this is mural... It's depicting a Gem war.
*'''Garnet''': Sad.
*'''Pearl''': In ancient times, the Prisms were used for war. Warriors of light marched across the battlefield...
*'''Steven''': So much violence! Why couldn't they all get along?
*'''Pearl''': Your mother used to ask the same thing. I wish I knew, Steven.
*'''Garnet''': The ancient Gems in this mural... they were powerful beings.
*'''Steven''': Just like us, right??
*'''Garnet''': Right.
*'''Pearl''': Steven, stay back!
*'''Amethyst''': Whoa, that's one bad momma jamma!
*'''Garnet''': This is it, the final light creature! Gems, get ready! That's not good.
*'''Stevven''': Whoops!
*'''Amethyst''': Aw, man!
*'''Pearl''': It's absorbed every color! What do we do?
*'''Garnet''': We fight! This is it, Gems!
*'''Steven''': O-okay Guys! I believe in us! LET'S GO, TEAM!
*'''Light Gem''': Why?
*'''Steven''': Um... guys... did you just... speak?
*'''Pearl''': What? The Monster?
*'''Steven''': Yeah! You didn't hear it? It said...
*'''Garnet''': Steven, look out!
*'''Light Gem''': I'm sorry... I failed... you...
*'''Steven''': What do you mean?
*'''Garnet''': Steven, focus on the battle.
*'''Light Gem''': I'm sorry... I failed... you...
*'''Steven''': It's gonna be ok.
*'''Garnet''': Steven! You're communicating with it.
*'''Light Gem''': I'm sorry...
*'''Steven''': You don't have to be sorry!
*'''Light Gem''': What... do... you... want... from me...
*'''Steven''': Wait a minute... You think I'm your master? Pearl! Didn't you say the Prism was used to command and army of light??
*'''Pearl''': Well, yes, when powerful Gems held the Prisms they... Steven...
*'''Steven''': When I touched the Prism... The light creatures come out to fight FOR me! But this whole time we've been fighting them. Thy must've been so confused!
*'''Light Gem''': Master...
*'''Steven''': You don't have to fight.!
*'''Garnet''': Steven...
*'''Steven''': I know you're fighting for me! But you don't have to! You don't have to be a weapon!
*'''Light Gem''': What... Do you want... Me to be?...
*'''Steven''': Whatever you want!!! YOU CAN BE ANYTHING!
*'''Garnet''': Good job, Steven.
*'''Steven''': (Laughs)
