{{TD|Peridot| You're my last chance. I've got no [[Flask Robonoids]]. I've got no ''foot!'' I've got no response from [[Yellow Diamond]]! *breathes in and out, calming herself down* I know you fixed [[Lapis Lazuli|Lazuli's]] gem. Whatever you did, you've got to do it to the Homeworld Warp!

{{TD|Steven| Hey, hey- come on! Earth isn't that bad...}}
{{TD|Peridot| It doesn't matter what Earth is like! It's not going to be like ''anything soon!'' *pulls on her face in panic*}}

{{TD|Peridot| Kyaah!}}
{{TD||(''Peridot shoots three energy blasts in quick succession at the Gems, who dodges out of the way, and tries to fly away with  her helicopter fingers.

{{TD|Amethyst| Ughh, sick, there's bits of her all over.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Nope, she's right here. *bubbles Peridot's gem and sends it off* And now she's in the [[Crystal Temple|temple]].}}
{{TD|Pearl| *picks up a piece to inspect* So these weren't actually part of her body?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *snatches Pearl's piece, scoops up the rest and drops them all into the ocean, making it looks like an accident* Uhh whoops.}}
{{TD|Steven| Garnet, she was trying to tell us something...}}
{{TD|Garnet| Those were just the desperate lies of a Gem who's been caught. You don't need to worry about her anymore. *walks off*}}

{{TD|Steven| *with puppy eyes* Oh my gosh... you're so... ''cuuuuute!'' *approaches Peridot, who is now shorter than usual*}}
{{TD|Peridot| My [[Limb Enhancers|limb enhancers]]! Where are my ''limb enhancers?!'' *inspects her whole body*}}
{{TD|Steven| Aw, you're like.. an angry little slice of pie!}}
{{TD|Peridot| Stop talking! I ''demand'' to know what this place is, and where I- *looks up and sees the array of other bubbled Gems* Oh my stars... You're going to ''harvest'' me?!}}

{{TD||(''Peridot tackles Steven and slaps him over and over again.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Why are you acting like this!?}}
{{TD|Peridot| You smashed me into a limbless cloud! You trapped me in your bubble dungeon! And, you called me... *sniffs and blushes angrily* '''''cute!''''' *tries to punch Steven, but misses*}}
{{TD|Steven| I didn't poof you! I freed you!}}
{{TD|Peridot| *faces Steven and curls up* ... Why would you make such a miscalculation?}}
{{TD|Steven| Back at the Warp Pad, what were you trying to say? Why do we need you? What do you know?}}
{{TD|Peridot| What do I know? Everything there ''is'' to know about the Cluster, you ''pebble''.}}
{{TD|Steven| Cluster? Wait, "pebble"?}}
{{TD|Peridot| My mission. The reason why I'm on this sad rock in the first place! I was to check progress on [[the Cluster]]! Just in and out, before it hatches. I wasn't supposed to get stuck here! But now it's going to emerge and nothing can stop it, and we'll all be shattered! *panics*}}
{{TD|Steven| Okay, okay, wait, slow down. Now, from the top... *sits down in front of Peridot* Emerging, hatching, Clusters.}}
{{TD|Peridot| You wanna know?}}
{{TD|Steven| Yes.}}

{{TD|Pearl| Should we tell her that's the bathroom?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Ehh.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Steven's Bathroom]]]}}
{{TD|Peridot| *looking around* Hmm... Seems I discovered some sort of archaic... think-chamber. Roomy, with a fresh hint of Earth citrus. *opens the toilet lid* A perfect crossroads for my escape.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Steven's Bathroom]}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *tries to turn the doorknob* It's locked.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Peridot, open the door!}}

{{TD|Amethyst| Trust me, I've tried.}}
{{TD|Pearl| How did she get out? We bubbled her!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Maybe we needed a bigger bubble.}}
{{TD|Garnet| My bubbles are fine.}}
{{TD|Steven| *sweating anxiously* ... I did it.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl glare at Steven in shock and anger.'')  }}
{{TD|Pearl| Steven! Why would you do such a thing!?}}
{{TD|Steven| Because she knows something! Something that's made her scared!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *punches into her palm* Duh. Homegirl knows we're gonna beat her into a green pancake.}}
{{TD|Steven| No, not 'cause of us. 'Cause of something called "the Cluster".}}
{{TD|Garnet| Cluster? That's new. *crosses her arms* }}
{{TD|Pearl| What else did she tell you?}}
{{TD|Steven| That's all I got.}}
{{TD|Peridot| That's right, you dirt bombs! You don't even know what's coming!!! *notices the mirror* Ooh..}}
{{TD|Garnet| I'm tired of playing these games. }}
{{TD||(''Peridot is seen making faces in the mirror.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| If we can't fight her, then fine. We'll talk. Peridot!}}
{{TD|Peridot| Whoa! *slips off the sink*}}
{{TD|Garnet| Alright, no more fighting. Let's just have a civil conversation.}}
{{TD|Peridot| As if I'd negotiate with you, ''filthy war machine''!}}
{{TD|Garnet| *summons her gauntlets angrily* Okay, let's kick her butt.}}
{{TD|Steven| Wait!}}
{{TD|Peridot| *holds a plunger while hanging from the shower curtains* Yeah! Destroy me again, and have fun trying to talk to me when I'm in a bubble! *quickly covers her mouth while clinging to the shower curtains, regretting what she said*}}
{{TD|Pearl| I really hate to say it, but unfortunately if she has information, she's more valuable to us like... this.}}
{{TD|Garnet| This is going to be tricky.}}
{{TD||(''Water gushing is then heard.'')}}
{{TD|Peridot| H-h-hot hot hot!}}
{{TD|Steven| You have to turn the knob the other way for cold!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Kitchen]}}
{{TD||(''The Crystal Gems then gather in the kitchen to discuss, while Steven drinks from a cup.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Wait, so we're just gonna let her live in my bathroom?}}

{{TD|Steven| But, I need to use the bathroom!}}
{{TD|Pearl| Right now?}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah, kinda.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Just go in the ocean, bro. Pssssh. ''Like a feeyush''.}}
{{TD|Steven| What's with you guys and making me pee outside!? *storms off*}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Well I have fun doing it..}}
{{TD||[Time Skip — Dawn]}}
{{TD||(''The Gems are still discussing in the background in the kitchen, while a half-awake Steven, carrying Peridot's prosthetic foot, walks past.'')}}

{{TD|Amethyst| She's never gonna talk to us.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Looks like there's not much else we can do right now.}}
{{TD|Pearl| We have her in our custody at least, even if the circumstances are less than optimal. How important do you think this Cluster is?}}
{{TD|Garnet| If it has anything to do with the experiments she was conducting in the Kindergarten, then very.}}
{{TD|Steven| *knocks on the bathroom door* Peridot, can I come in? I need to get ready for the day.}}
{{TD|Peridot| No!}}
{{TD|Steven| I have something for you.}}

{{TD|Peridot| No, it's too late! You... wouldn't happen to have the rest?}}
{{TD|Steven| *washing his face* Uh, sorry, we lost them. *pauses* Well, we kinda threw 'em away. *points to the toothbrush on the floor* Can you pass me that?}}
{{TD|Peridot| *picks up Steven's toothbrush* Is this a weapon!?}}
{{TD|Steven| Only for cavities.}}
{{TD|Peridot| Hmm. *tosses the toothbrush to Steven*}}
{{TD|Steven| Thanks! *begins brushing his teeth*}}
{{TD|Peridot| *looking around Steven at the sink* Is that a weapon?}}
{{TD|Steven| No, that's a comb I never use.}}
{{TD|Peridot| *climbs onto the toilet* Is ''that'' a weapon?}}
{{TD|Steven| Hmm? Oh, well, I guess if you get it wet and roll it up. *rolls up his towel, and Peridot flinches in fear* Look, I know you're scared, but I'm not going to hurt you. And whatever's going on, whatever the "Cluster" is, I wanna help.}}
{{TD|Peridot| I doubt you can help me, but I... appreciate the offer.}}
{{TD|Steven| *smiles* Now do you mind moving? *points at the toilet* I have to use that.}}
