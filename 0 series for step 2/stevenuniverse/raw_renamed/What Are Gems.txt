{{TD|Altogether|'''The Classroom Gems! What are [[Gems]]?'''}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]|Welcome to Gem classroom. I'm Pearl, and today we're going to talk about what Gems are.}}
{{TD||(''Three [[gemstones]], one blue, one red, and one purple going to the right, appear on a chalkboard behind Pearl.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Simplified down to our basic form, Gems are- *chuckles* Well, just ''gems.'' *giggles* Our bodies are actually projections generated by our gemstone.}}
{{TD||(''The gemstones transform into [[Garnet]] and [[Amethyst]].'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Think of it like a hologram, but with mass.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Nice mass.}}
{{TD|Garnet|I know.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Ahem! Though Gems are extraordinarily resilient, if they're seriously hurt, they will release their physical form.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Yow!}}
{{TD||(''Garnet hits Amethyst on the head, causing her to poof back into her gemstone.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|And poof back to just their gem.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet flings Amethyst's gemstone from her foot to her hand, and begins throwing it up and down.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|This way, they can most efficiently put all of their energy into regenerating themselves. And when a Gem is reduced to its gemstone, it can be contained in a bubble-}}
{{TD||(''Garnet [[Bubbling|bubbles]] Amethyst's gemstone.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Or trapped in an object, making it impossible to re-form. But don't worry.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet pops the bubble containing Amethyst's gemstone, dropping it on the ground.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|As long as the gemstone isn't damaged, the Gem will be able to regenerate.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst instantly regenerates back to her projected form.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Ta-da! Check me out! Ha! I'm as good as new!}}
{{TD|Pearl|''But''... If a Gem's gemstone is cracked-}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst shapeshifts a third arm on her head and begins wiggling her arms around.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Things get really weird.}}
{{TD|Pearl|And if a Gem's gem is [[Gem Shards|shattered]] completely, they'll cease to be.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Good thing I'm super tough.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Mm-hmm.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet summons her gauntlet and tries to hit Amethyst, who quickly dodges away.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Whoa! Not that tough! Waahhh!}}
{{TD||(''Garnet begins chasing after Amethyst off the chalkboard.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|That's all for today's lesson.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst runs by, still being chased by Garnet.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Ahem!}}
{{TD|[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]|*waving his hand rapidly* Wait, I have a question.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet and Amethyst run by again.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|What if a Gem is half human?}}
{{TD|Pearl|That is a ''very'' good question! The answer is you!}}
{{TD|Steven|*gasps* Me!}}
{{TD||(''The word "Homework" appears on the chalkboard behind Pearl.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Why don't you write an essay about what it's like to be yourself?}}
{{TD|Steven|What's an essay?}}
{{TD|Pearl|Ehh... Class dismissed!}}
{{TD||(''The school bell rings as the words "Class Dismissed!" are shown.'')}}
