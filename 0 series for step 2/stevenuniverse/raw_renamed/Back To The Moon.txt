{{TD||(''Following the events in "[[Earthlings]]", [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]], [[Amethyst]] and [[Peridot]] return back to the barn to find the five [[Rubies|Rubies]], trapped in water bubbles by [[Lapis Lazuli|Lapis]], and their [[Roaming Eye]] parked nearby. [[Garnet]] and [[Pearl]] are also in the scene.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|The Rubies are back?!}}
{{TD|Lapis|They showed up on their little ship acting very angry. So I put them in time-out.}}
{{TD|Steven|I thought we were done with these guys! *walks up to the Rubies* Why did you come back here?}}
{{TD|Garnet|Let's release one and just ask what they're up to.}}
{{TD|Steven|Ooh, ooh! Can I pick?}}
{{TD|Garnet|Go for it.}}
{{TD||(''Steven walks closer and scans through the Rubies.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Hmm... Oh! Let's talk to [[Ruby (Leggy)|"Leggy"]]!}}
{{TD|Pearl|"Leggy"?}}
{{TD|Steven|I named them based on the placement of their [[Gemstones|gems]]. There's "Leggy", [[Ruby (Army)|"Army"]], [[Ruby (Navy)|"Navy"]], [[Ruby (Eyeball)|"Eyeball"]], and, uh... [[Ruby (Doc)|"Doc"]]. "Leggy" seems like the easiest to talk to.}}
{{TD|Lapis|"Leggy", come on down!}}
{{TD||(''Lapis pops the water bubble trapping "Leggy", and she falls onto the ground.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Hey! Hi, I'm Steven. What brings you back to [[Earth]]?}}
{{TD|"Leggy"|Uh... *sits up* I... don't... know? *shrugs*}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, uh, I understand. I used to forget why we go on missions all the time.}}
{{TD|"Leggy"|I'll just go stand over here then. *walks over to stand by the fence*}}
{{TD|Steven|Let's take a chance on "Army".}}
{{TD||(''"Army"'s bubble pops and she falls to the ground.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Good afternoon!-}}
{{TD|"Army"|*in rage* RAAH! *charges toward Steven* I'll tear you limb- Huh?}}
{{TD|Garnet|*picks "Army" up by the back of her tunic* Hey! Don't be like that.}}
{{TD|"Army"|Why I oughta razzle-frazzle your- *flails about while mumbling angrily*}}
{{TD|Garnet|Aww. *tucks "Army" under her arm*}}
{{TD|"Army"|Hey, what the- *flails her legs and continues mumbling angrily*}}
{{TD|Garnet|Next!}}
{{TD|Steven|Ehh... "Navy"?}}
{{TD||(''"Navy" is then freed from her water bubble.'')}}
{{TD|"Navy"|If I remember correctly, we were on Earth- *pauses and sees the [[Crystal Gems|Gems]] staring at her, causing her to blush and look away* Uh... hah! This is so embarrassing! *covers her face* Oh-ho- *looks back at the [[Gems]]* Aah! *runs away and cowers next to "Leggy"*}}
{{TD|Steven|Okay, "Eyeball"?}}
{{TD||(''"Eyeball" is then released.'')}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|I'm not tellin' y'all nothin' about nothin'! *crosses her arms and growls*}}
{{TD|Steven|The only one left now is, uh... "Doc".}}
{{TD||(''Lastly, "Doc" is released.'')}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Where's [[Jasper]]? Last time we came, you tricked us into playing that ''stuuupid'' game! Then, you said: *air-quotes* "She's on Neptune", so we looked, and she wasn't there. She wasn't on Neptune! Or any other planet in this whole dang solar system!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst walks past behind the Gems in the background, pondering to herself.'')}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Tell us where she is ''right now''. No games, no tricks, and no slick disguises.}}
{{TD||(''"Army" jumps out of Garnet's hands, and the [[Homeworld Gems]] assemble.'')}}
{{TD|Homeworld Rubies|Yeah!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|HEY!}}
{{TD||(''The Rubies turn to look in Amethyst's direction, who has shapeshifted herself to look like Jasper.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|*trying to imitate Jasper's impression* I'm right here.}}
{{TD||(''The Crystal Gems stare at Amethyst in perplexity.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Is she serious? There's no way this is gonna-}}
{{TD|"Army"|Look, it's Jasper!}}
{{TD||(''The Homeworld Rubies all cheer and mumble excitedly. "Eyeball" pushes through the other Homeworld Rubies and approaches Amethyst.'')}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|Jasper! I'm Ruby 1F4 Cut 4ND. I fought in [[The Rebellion|the war]] for Earth. *does the Gem salute*}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Uh... At ease.}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|I was on the ground in Facet 6 when I heard the tale of the [[Beta Kindergarten|Facet 9 Kindergarten]] Quartz that could. They said you popped out of the ground with your helmet on, and took out 80 Crystal Gems before the sun went down. When I found out this mission was to look for you, I nearly dissipated my form! It is... an honor to finally meet you.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Yep! That's me! Always huge, never small, all the- all the time since I was made! *smiles nervously*}}
{{TD|"Eyeball")|Wait a minute! *gets suspicious* You look different than I thought you would.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Oh, here it is.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Oh, you must mean my tan! You know, from the sun! *points to the Sun*}}
{{TD||(''"Eyeball" glares suspiciously at Amethyst for a moment, and then smiles.'')}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|Stupid Earth sun! *kicks up a clod of dirt* I hate this planet!}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Curse this planet! *kicks up more dirt and strikes a pose*}}
{{TD||(''The Homeworld Rubies run in cheering and begin to kick up chunks of dirt as well. The Crystal Gems continue to star in perplexity as Pearl facepalms in disbelief.'')}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Well, it's a good thing we finally found you. [[Yellow Diamond]] is awaiting your return. We'll take you back to [[Gem Homeworld|Homeworld]] right away.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|*normal voice* No! I-I mean- *clears her throat, Jasper's voice* I, Jasper, have decided to stay on Earth.}}
{{TD|"Doc"|What?}}
{{TD|"Leggy"|Why?}}
{{TD|"Navy"|Yeah, why, Jasper?}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Because... I gotta stay here! With these guys! *walks next to the Crystal Gems* Yup, gotta keep 'em prisoner. (''Lapis rolls her eyes.'') For [[The Great Diamond Authority|the Diamonds]].}}
{{TD||(''"Eyeball" begins to clap solemnly while "Navy" wipes away a tear. The other Homeworld Rubies join in clapping and weeping as well.'')}}
{{TD|"Leggy"|Jasper...}}
{{TD|"Navy"|Such devotion.}}
{{TD|"Doc"|*walks up to Amethyst, wiping her eyes* Well, Yellow will definitely wanna know about this. You'll have to file a report at the nearest [[Moon Base|Diamond base]].}}
{{TD||(''The Homeworld Rubies chatter among themselves, wondering where the nearest Diamond base is.'')}}
{{TD|"Leggy"|Where's that?}}
{{TD|"Navy"|Think we passed it on the way here?}}
{{TD|"Doc"|You dummies! It's uh, it's... hm.}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|Argh! It's there!}}
{{TD||(''"Eyeball" points at the moon, still visible in the bright sky.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*shocked, normal voice* I gotta hold this all the way to the moon?! *Jasper's voice* Uh... Hold this...hold ''these''... prisoners! *points at Crystal Gems* I gotta bring these rebel prisoners if we're going to the moon! Can't leave them here unsupervised.}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Very well, to the ship!}}
{{TD||(''The Homeworld Rubies begin marching into the Roaming Eye. The Crystal Gems begin to chide Amethyst.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|What are you doing? This isn't going to work!}}
{{TD|Garnet|You can't hold that form forever.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|*whispering, normal voice* I can do this! We'll go to the moon, come back, and they'll leave us alone. Just play along.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst lightly shoves the Crystal Gems forward, and they walk towards the ship too. Amethyst then turns to Peridot and Lapis.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|*normal voice* Oh hey! You guys wanna be prisoners too?}}
{{TD|Lapis|Not really. (''Peridot holds onto Lapis' arm.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Alright! Just checking.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Roaming Eye]}}
{{TD||(''The Homeworld Rubies march towards the ship control panels as the Crystal Gems enter the ship.'')}}
{{TD|Homeworld Rubies|Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!}}
{{TD|Steven|Woah, it's huge in here! I thought it'd be super cramped.}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|Hey! This ain't no pleasure cruise!}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Yeah! Show some respect, you... Crystal ''Germs''!}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Yeah, you tell 'em Jasper.}}
{{TD|"Army"|I bet they got those germs from Earth!}}
{{TD||(''The Crystal Gems decide to play along with Amethyst's act.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Aw, curses! I can't believe we've been caught, and by none other than Jasper! So cross over it. *sits down against the ship wall*}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh huh, that sure is Jasper! The one that caught us. Harumph. *sits down next to Garnet*}}
{{TD|Pearl|*prances and points at Amethyst dramatically* Of all the indignities! Do what you want! I'll never talk!}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Heh. I wish.}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|Yeah, haha! She talks a lot!}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Go sit over there now!}}
{{TD|"Navy"|*walks up to "Leggy"* Wow. Jasper's so funny and strong!}}
{{TD|"Leggy"|I was just thinking that!}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|*normal voice* Heheh. This is fun-}}
{{TD|"Doc"|*suddenly walks up to Amethyst* Jasper!}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Ah! I'm Jasper!}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Please feel free to take my seat right up front. The captain's seat. *points towards the seat* It would be an honor.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Yeah. Yes. Sure thing.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst walks over and sits in the captain's seat.'')}}
{{TD|Ruby ("Doc")|I hope it's to your liking.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|It's alright.}}
{{TD|"Doc"|You can go ahead and head towards the moon base whenever you're ready.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Uhhh... Of course! Heh.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst looks at the controls in confusion. She turns to glance at the Crystal Gems, as Steven groans nervously.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Uh, listen. *lifts "Doc" up and sits her on her laps* I'm Jasper, and I'm too worn out from catching rebels to fly, so I'll just sit here like this and you work the thing to get us to the moon. Got it?}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Yes. Of course.}}
{{TD||(''"Eyeball" looks at Amethyst and "Doc", sitting on her laps, and sheds a tear of envy.'')}}
{{TD|"Doc"|To the moon, then?}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|To the moon, then!}}
{{TD|Homeworld Rubies|To the moon, then!}}
{{TD||(''The Roaming Eye starts up and begin flying towards the moon.'')}}
{{TD|"Doc"|We'll be arriving shortly.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|*sweating* Hey, keep my seat warm. While I check on our uh... prisoners.}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Yes, Jasper. Good idea.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst gets off the seat, sits "Doc" in it, and walks towards the Crystal Gems.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| NOOOOOO! Stay away from us, you brute!}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|*whispering, normal voice* Tone it down, Pearl. That one Ruby wants to throw you out into space.}}
{{TD||(''The Crystal Gems glances at "Army", who is looking at Pearl menacingly and punching her palm.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Sorry. Got a bit carried away.}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh, you okay, Amethyst? You've been holding that form forever now.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|*whispering, normal voice* I've got it under control. *Jasper's voice* Hey, my seat better still be warm when I get over there! *walks back to the captain's seat*}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Moon Base]}}
{{TD||(''The Roaming Eye eventually arrive at the Moon Base, enters it, and smoothly hovers onto the moon base's ground floor. "Doc" uses her gem to shine light like a flashlight and the Homeworld Rubies begin to step out of the ship.'')}}
{{TD|"Doc"|All clear!}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|Right this way, Jasper.}}
{{TD|Pearl|*dramatically* Oh, Jasper, won't you ever let us go?}}
{{TD||(''Steven exits the ship and begins to float around in excitement, but Garnet quickly grabs him and holds his hand. "Eyeball" shines her gem too and starts looking around the dark Moon Base.'')}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|Look at this place, frozen in time. An Era-1 base. ''Her'' Era-1 base. *shines her light at a mural of an unknown Diamond* It was a tragedy, what happened to her.}}
{{TD|"Leggy"|Who is that anyway?}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|Were you made yesterday?! That, is [[Pink Diamond]]. Jasper, maybe it's best if you explain.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|*normal voice* What, me? No- *Jasper's voice* No, you do it. I'm, like, too messed up about it?}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|I understand. She ''was'' your original Diamond.}}
{{TD||(''The group begin to climb the staircase to the top control room, as "Eyeball" tells the tale about Pink Diamond's demise.'')}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|Earth was Pink Diamond's colony. Everything was going smoothly at first. [[Kindergarten]]s were incubating their first soldiers. Big, warm pieces of [[Quartzes|Quartz]], like this mountain over here- *looks at Amethyst* -were being created from its rich minerals with great success. Then BAM! One of Pink Diamond's very own Quartz soldiers started a rebellion and took it too far. *turns towards Amethyst* Where were you when it happened?}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|Oh, you know, around?}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|I was there. I saw it with my own eye. I watched the leader of the Crystal Gems, [[Rose Quartz]], ''shatter'' Pink Diamond!}}
{{TD||(''Everyone freezes as "Eyeball" reveals the stunning fact. Steven glares in disbelief at Garnet and Pearl, who is shivering violently and covering her mouth.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|No! Rose Quartz would never do that! *tears up* A-And, sure, she had to fight but- but she would never shatter someone!}}{{TD||(''Amethyst and the Homeworld Rubies turn to look at Steven.'')}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Hey! We got a problem.}}
{{TD||[Trans Int. Moon Base Control Room]}}
{{TD||(''The Homeworld Rubies gather to inspect the [[It Could've Been Great|broken control panel]].'')}}
{{TD|"Doc"|The panel is broken. The [[Diamond Communicator|communicator]] is gone! There's no way to contact Yellow Diamond from this hub.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst walks in, sweating excessively from trying to keep her form as Jasper.'')}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|''Crystal Geeems!''}}
{{TD|Other Rubies|Unbelievable! Rude! No respect!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst shapeshifts back to her normal form to catch a breather.'')}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|See? They'll stoop to anything!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst quickly shapeshifts back into Jasper as "Doc" turns towards her.'')}}
{{TD|"Doc"|We'll have to take you to Homeworld to file a report in person.}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|*straining* I ''can't!'' I can't go!}}
{{TD|Homeworld Rubies|Huh? I don't understand. What do you mean? What's going on?}}
{{TD||(''"Eyeball" rushes in front of Amethyst in concerns.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''Jasper'')|You know what? *pats "Eyeball"'s head* You know me. Do me a favor and go back home and file the report for me.  I'm trusting you, soldier.}}
{{TD|"Eyeball"|Wow. *excitedly* Of course!}}
{{TD|"Doc"|That settles it. All right, Rubies, back to the ship!}}
{{TD||(''As "Doc" speaks, Amethyst gives Pearl a smug look. Pearl then facepalms in exasperation.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans Int. Moon Base Ground Floor]}}
{{TD||(''"Eyeball" waves to Amethyst as she climbs into the Roaming Eye and Amethyst waves back. As the ship's door closes and the engine starts up, Amethyst finally shapeshifts back to her default form and runs over to the Crystal Gems.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|All right, Amethyst!}}
{{TD|Garnet|You really held it together.}}
{{TD|Pearl|You did it! I told you you could.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*high-fives Pearl and Steven and chuckles* Aww.}}
{{TD||(''Steven walks over to look at the mural of Pink Diamond portrait, when the door of the Roaming Eye opens again.'')}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Hey, you need a ride back to Earth? I could sit on your lap if you want- *sees Amethyst in her default form* What?!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*yelling hurriedly* I'm still Jasper!}}
{{TD|"Doc"|We've been tricked? Again?!}}
{{TD|Other Rubies|No way!}}
{{TD|"Doc"|Rubies, assemble!}}
{{TD|Homeworld Rubies|Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup! Yeah!}}
{{TD||(''The Homeworld Rubies jump onto one another and begin to [[Fusion Gems|fuse]] into a single giant Ruby.'')}}
{{TD|[[Ruby (Giant Ruby)|"Giant" Ruby]]|Yeah! We won't let you trick us again!}}
{{TD|Steven|Hey, Rubies! *stands next to the Moon Base door* If you're gonna fight, take it outside!}}
{{TD||(''Steven activates the door switch, opening the door and the giant Ruby gets sucked halfway out the door.'')}}

{{TD|"Giant" Ruby|Oof!}}
{{TD||(''The giant Ruby unfuses back into the Rubies and are sucked out the door into space. As "Eyeball" is sucked out the door, she grabs Steven and pulls him out with her. Steven screams as he too gets sucked into space.'')}}
