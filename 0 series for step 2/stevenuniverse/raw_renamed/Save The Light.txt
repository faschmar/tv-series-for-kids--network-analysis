*'''[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]''': (Narrating) Long ago... There was a powerful weapon. A [[Light Prism|Prism]] that could create entire armies of light. It was really bad news. But then, one day, the Prism was lost! Never ever to be found again... Until it was! By four brave adventures! That's us! [[Garnet]]. [[Amethyst]]. and [[Pearl]]... ...and ME!! The [[Crystal Gems]]! But we accidentally unleashed the light inside! Wuh oh! So we traveled all over the world to retrieve each color. It was a really great adventure! Just when we thought our quest was over, the light turned into a really big bad, monster... Rawr, let's fight! But I told it "We don't have to do this! You don't have to be a weapon! You can be anything you want to be!" And then, it didn't want to fight anymore! It's shape started to change, and suddenly it became... ...ME!! And that's the story of my great Prism adventure, and how I met this dashing fellow... [[George|Light Steven]]!
*'''[[Connie Maheswaran|Connie]]''': Wow... so cool...
*'''Steven''': I know, right? Check this out! He's got all my moves!
*'''Connie''': Hahaha! Wow, Steven. He's great!
*'''Steven''': Hey, that's not one of my moves! Um, that doesn't usually happen...
*'''Connie''': C'mon, Steven! Let's go check outside!
*'''Steven''': [[Cheeseburger Backpack (object)|Cheeseburger Backpack]]! Don't leave home without it!
*'''Connie''': There it is!
*'''Steven''': Hey! Wait up, lil guy!
*'''Connie''': Let's go, Steven! Was that really in the sand? I'm not sure if I'd eat that... Hmm. I wonder what it's up to?
*'''Steven''': Maybe it wants a donut? We should probably head back... I think it's trying to lead us somewhere!
*'''Connie''': Yeah, I think you're right! Quick! We don't want to keep it waiting!
*'''Sadie''': Hey Lars, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
*'''[[Lars Barriga|Lars]]''': Uh huh. Yo, Steven.
*'''Steven''': Hey, Lars... did you see happen to see a magical floating Prism thingie float by here?
*'''Lars''': Nope.
*'''Steven''': Um, Mr. Prism? Light Steven!! Oh no, something's wrong with him!
*'''[[Greg Universe|Greg]]''': Uh, Steven...
*'''Steven''': Dad, what's going on?!
*'''Greg''': Please tell me this is another friend of yours??
*'''Steven''': Wuh oh...
*'''Greg''': Um, giant spaceship? If you're gonna land, maybe you could move a skosh away from the... AHHH!!!!!
*'''Steven''': [[It's a Wash|CAR WASH]]! NOOOOOO!!!
*'''[[Hessonite]]''': Ah, the Earth. Did you miss me? Now, let's see, where is... Ah! THERE you are!
*'''Steven''': Eep!
*'''Hessonite''': I could feel it! Who activated you? They obviously don't know you're still mine. Get over here! My stars. You look absurd! Let's get you out of that shape post haste.
*'''Steven''': Hey! No! Who are you and why are you doing this? Leave him alone!
*'''Connie''': Yeah! He doesn't want to go with you!
*'''Steven''': Nooooo!!! Light Steven!!
*'''Hessonite''': Hmmm, that strange sound? What's that down there? ...Humans? Ha! REALLY! You... activated in the hands... of HUMANS? I leave you here for a few thousand years, and you're ready to activate for whoever... WHATEVER happens to grab you?! Well, I'll let you make it up to me. Turn on them and cut them to shreds! WHAAAT!!! What are these weak forms! Your blades... so FLIMSY! You've gone SOFT!!!!! Come with me, you're embrassing yourself!
*'''Steven''': WAIT! LIGHT STEEEEEVENN!!!
*'''Connie''': Steven. watch out!
*'''Greg''': ACK! Be careful, kids!!
*'''Connie''': Leave it to us, Mr. Universe!
*'''Steven''': Way to go, Connie!!
*'''Connie''': Thanks, Steven!
*'''Steven''': Okay, Steven! Now it's your time to shine! You've got this, Connie!
*'''Connie''': Yeah!!
*'''Greg''': That was coconuts! Are you kids okay??
*'''Steven''': Yeah... sorry about the car wash, Dad.
*'''Greg''': It's okay, Schtu-ball. At lease you're both safe. And hey, the van made it without a scratch! Welp. Looks like I've got some work to do cleaning up around here., Oy.
*'''Steven''': But what about the poor Light Steven? We've gotta save him!
*'''Connie''': We should tell the Crystal Gems what happened! They'll know what to do!
*'''Steven''': Yeah! Let's...
*'''[[Bill Dewey|Mayor Dewey]]''': (off-screen) YAAAAAAA!!!!!
*'''Connie''': Oh man, what is it now?
*'''Mayor Dewey''': Kids! You've gotta help me! There's a crazy blue raccoon on the [[Hot 2 Tot|Dewey Mobile]]!
*'''Connie''': You can count on us, Mayor Dewey!
*'''Mayor Dewey''': Oh good! That's government property, y'know!
*'''Connie''': Man, these guys are tough! I wish he had something to help us out...
*'''Steven''': I've got just the thing!
*'''Mayor Dewey''': Thank you, kids! But I still need your help!! These weird things have infested [[Beach City]]! They're public menace!! And worst of all: on my way here, I lost THE KEY TO THE CITY! They must've taken it! It's a crisis, I tell you! I need you two to get that key back for me!
*'''Steven''': Um, Mayor Dewey, we were just actually on our way to go find the Gems and--
*'''Mayor Dewey''': THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT!! This is of the UTMOST importance!! Here, take this official government document. You can reference that to make sure you find the right key! I'm sure if you track down more of those little blue guys, it'll lead you to the key!
*(Greg arrives)
*'''Greg''': Waaaait! I'm going with you!
*'''Steven''': Dad! Wait... really??
*'''Greg''': Yeah, I mean, I know it's not usually my place to join you on your magical missions... But I just saw a glittery space lady kidnap a giant magical version of my son! I can't just stand around here now! Plus, uh, I don't really have anything else to do, what with the car wash busted and all...
*'''Steven''': Wow! Embarking on an adventure with my best friend AND my Dad?? CAN'T... EXPRESS... EXCITMENT!!
*'''Greg''': So, I guess let's, uh... get this party started?
*'''Steven''': Oh yeah, while we look for this key, we should probably also go find the Gems! I think they said they were going to be at--
*'''Connie''': Steven, behind you!
*'''Greg''': STEVEN!! Oh no! What do we do??
*'''Connie''': Hang in there, Steven! I'll get you out!
*'''Steven''': So, I guess that's a thing that can happen... I owe ya one, Connie!
*'''Greg''': Yeah, um, let's be more careful, everyone...
*'''Steven''': Nanafua! Are you okay?
*'''[[Nanefua Pizza|Nanefua]]''': Yes! Why wouldn't I be?
*'''Steven''': Well, I'm not sure if you saw all the monsters running around Beach City?
*'''Nanafua''': Oh, yes! I just ran into a few and whooped their butts.
*'''Steven''': Whoa! Well, uh, carry on then!
*'''[[Kofi Pizza|Kofi]]''': Hey, Steven? You wouldn't happen to have anything to do with these strange monsters appearing in Beach City, would you?
*'''Steven''': Um, maaaayybbee...
*'''[[Mr. Fryman]]''': Oh bot. This is some of that Gem stuff [[Ronaldo Fryman|Ronaldo]] always talks about, isn't it?
*'''Steven''': Hey, Suitcase Sam! How's it going? Just suitcasin' it up, I see?
*'''[[Minor Characters/Humans#Suitcase Sam|Suitcase Sam]]''': ...
*'''Steven''': Cool, I'm just gonna keep walking then!
*'''Connie''': Hm, no key yet...
*'''Greg''': Don't worry, kids! I've got a good feeling about the next one!
*'''Steven''': Yeah, me too!!
*'''[[Jenny Pizza|Jenny]]''': Yo, Steven! Crazy day, right?
*'''Steven''': The craziest!
*'''Jenny''': Hey, so... you're a resourceful guy! Care to help me with something? My Dad sent me on an errand to go return this new pizza cutter he ordered. Wouldya believe it, it's too dull to cut pizza! Ridic, I know. But the store closed early due to all these monster shenanigans! Instead of returning this pizza cutter, maybe you can help me fix it? If you could find a way to sharpen it for me, I won't have to hear an earfull from my Dad.
*'''Greg''': [[Vidalia]]!
*'''Vidalia''': Hey hey! What are you troublemakers up to?
*'''Steven''': Oh, y'know. Saving the world from crazy light monsters.
*'''Vidalia''': Ah yeah, I've noticed those around today. Cool. That's good of you guys.
*'''Steven''': We try! So, whatcha doin'?
*'''Vidalia''': Basically just staring at this dumb empty canvas. I've got total artist's book. Say, Steven... maybe you can provide me a little inspiration! What do you think I should paint?
*'''Steven''': Paint my Dad! How 'bout a painting of my Dad? From back when you guys used to hang out?
*'''Greg''': Oh boy, I'm sure we can find a better subject than me...
*'''Vidalia''': I love it! A painting of my favorite rockstar! Thanks, Steven! come on by later and I'll share my progress.
*'''Steven''': There it is! KEY GET!
*'''Greg''': Wow, you kids sure are good at finding stuff!
*'''Connie''': Huzzah! Let's go bring it back to Mayor Dewey!
*'''Mayor Dewey''': Well, Universe? Did you find the key?? Let's see it!
*'''Steven''': Here you go, Mr. Mayor!
*'''Mayor Dewey''': Oh, thank goodness! Thank you, kids! You've done a great service for your city! As a small token oif my gratitude, let me reward you with this strange object I found!
*'''Steven''': Yay! I'm so proud of us!
*'''Connie''': Alright! Now we should probably go tell the Gems about what happened at the car wash!
*'''Steven''': Oh yeah, that! Knowing the Gems, I bet they're noticed this whole monsters all over the place thing... I'm sure they're somewhere here in Beach City fighting them off, just like we were!
*'''Connie''': Hm, maybe if we head up the hill to the [[The Lighthouse|lighthouse]], we can spot them?
*'''Steven''': That sounds like pretty much the best idea ever!
*'''Sadie''': AAAARRRRGHHH!
*'''Steven''': [[Sadie Miller|Sadie]]? Is everything okay?
*'''Sadie''': Oh, haha. Didn't see you there. Steven. Yeah, the ice machine's not working and I still need to make a batch of frozen donuts. 
*'''Steven''': Hold up! Donuts can be... frozen??
*'''Sadie''': Well, yeah. They're like donuts filled with ice cream.
*'''Steven''': *gasp* That sounds divine...
*'''Sadie''': It is. But I can't make any until we get some ice.
*'''Steven''': We're on the case!! Hey, [[Lion]]! Have you seen the Gems today??
*'''Lion''': Zzzzz...
*'''Greg''': I'm guessing that's a no...
*'''Steven''': Hey, wait! Down there, on the beach, that looks like...
*'''Connie''': Who do you see, Steven?
*'''Steven''': Amethyst!
*'''Connie''': You're right, there she is! They should call you Eagle Eyes Universe!
*'''Steven''': Oh no! Watch out, Amethyst! C'mon, we've gotta go help her! Lion, I didn't know you liked to nap up here!
*'''Lion''': Zzzzz...
*'''Steven''': Though I guess you pretty much to nap everywhere, don'tcha buddy?
*'''Lion''': Zzzzz...
*'''Steven''': Cool, good talk!
*'''Lion''': Zzzzz... ....?
*'''Steven''': Lion! You're awake! So, hey, want to help us out with...
*'''Lion''': Zzzz...
*'''Steven''': Okay, maybe next time! Amethyst!!
*'''Amethyst''': Hey, dudes! Don't mind me! Just single-handledly saving Beach City from some weirdo monsters. All in a day's work, y'know?
*'''Connie''': Mind if we lend a hand?
*'''Amethyst''': Thought you'd never ask! Niii~iiice! Sooo, you guys know the city's, like, crawling with these things, right?
*'''Steven''': Yeah! Amethyst, it was a [[Homeworld Gems|Homeworld Gem]]!! She destroyed Dad's car wash and stole the Prism and unleashed all these monsters!! And now we've gotta rescue Light Me!!!!
*'''Amethyst''': Whoa, slow down there, Turbo! The car wash, really? Bummer.
*'''Greg''': Yeah, tell me about it...
*'''Steven''': Amethyst, do you know anything about a Gem who'd came to Earth looking for the Prism? Um, she was, uh, really tall. Fluffy hair... kinda orange-ish?
*'''Amethyst''': Um, nope, doesn't ring a bell. What's all this biz about a Prism, again?
*'''Steven''': You know, the one you guys found that day, and it started that whole adventure where we went around the world battling the light creatures?
*'''Amethyst''': Hmmm.
*'''Steven''': You don't remember?
*'''Amethyst''': I guess, sorta. That seems like a long time ago, right? We go on a lot of adventures...
*'''Connie''': We were hoping you or the other Gems would know what to do next?
*'''Amehtyst''': Ha, um, well... I DID see a really huge ship fly over there towards the forest. So, we should totally go follow it, right? Yeah! What are we waiting for! Let's go find this Prism snatcher!
*'''Steven''': Shouldn't we tell the other Gems first? I dunno... Yeah! Let's mash her potatoes!
*'''Amethyst''': YEA-YUH! That's what I'm talkin' 'bout! This [[Gem Homeworld|Homeworld]] punk's got no idea what's comin' her way!
*'''[[Kiki Pizza|Kiki]]''': Hey, Steven. I think my Dad wants to talk to you...
*'''Kofi''': STEVEN!!
*'''Steven''': Oh, uh, hey Mr. Pizza...
*'''Kofi''': DID YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS UNLEASH MONSTERS IN BEACH CITY AGAIN??
*'''Steven''': What? No! Well, maybe indirectly?...
*'''Kofi''': Do you know have ANY idea how bad this is for business?? YOU should make this up to me, personally!
*'''Steven''': Oh, well, we're trying to hunt down these monsters right now, actually!
*'''Kofi''': That's not enough!! If you really want to make it up to me... you can help us deliver pizza! Talk to Kiki to start taking deliveries.
*'''Steven''': Oh, uh, y-yes sir!
*'''Kiki''': Sorry about my Dad, Steven.
*'''Steven''': It's okay. Helping is what the Crystal Gems are all about!
*'''Kiki''': Well then, that's great! I've already got a delivery for you to run. It's for Suitcase Sam.
*'''Steven''': Makes sense! If there's one thing I know about Suitcase Sam, it's that he loves his pizza! Actually, I don't know anything about Suitcase Sam. Hi Suitcase Sam! I've got one pizza with *your* fun nickname on it!
*'''Suitcase Sam''': Mmm!
*'''Steven''': Pleasure doing business with you!
*'''Kiki''': Yo, Steven! I've got another delivery I could use your help with! This one's for Vidalia. Can you scoot on over to her for me?
*'''Steven''': On it like a bonnet! Pizza time!
*'''Vidalia''': Ah, artist fuel! Thanks, Steven!
*'''Steven''': [[Sour Cream|Sour Creeeam]]!
*'''Sour Cream''': Hey, it's Steven. Maybe, you can help me. I'm playing the semi-annual DJ rave thing tonight, but I left all my glow sticks in the forest. Bummer, right?
*'''Steven''': Your glow sticks?? Those are your signature items!
*'''Sour Cream''': I knew you'd understand. If you can find 10 glow sticks, I'll give you a sick reward. Oh, actually. I've got one glowstick on me here. Maybe you could take it as like, y'know, a reminder to find the others?
*'''[[Peedee Fryman|Peedee]]''': S-S-STEVEN! MONSTERS!
*'''Steven''': Don't worry, Peedee! We'll protect you and your tasty fries!! HEY! Light guys! No one messes with the [[Beach Citywalk Fries|Fry Shack]]!
*'''Peedee''': Phew. T-thanks, Steven. I'm going to make a conscious decision not to ask what's going on, and instead just focus on doing on my job.
*'''Steven''': That's probably for the best!
*'''Peedee''': Since you saved my life, I guess I can give you some fries on the house.
*'''Kiki''': Hey, Steven! Thanks for your help, but I don't have any other deliveries that need to go out right now. Though I could use a hand again next time you're around! Be sure to stop by later.
*'''Kofi''': How are the deliveries going, Steven? Don't forget: you still owe me!
*'''[[Harold Smiley|Mr. Smiley]]''': Hey, you kids are alright! It's your efforts that'll allow the quarters to keep flowing! As a small token of gratitude... here's a token! It's for our latest and greatest addition... BOLTRON! Son of Zoltron! This baby should look familiar to you, Steven! But of course, this guy is ALL NEW! Kids these days want a contest refresh of new attractions, you know.
*'''Steven''': Oooooo... all new...
*'''Mr. Smiley''': Monsters are pretty much always bad for business. Good luck hunting 'em down, kids! Ha!
*'''Boltron''': Boltron predicts you will open your inventory and select a Boltron token!
*'''Steven''': Oh man, he really can see into the future!!
*'''Boltron''': Check the prize dispenser below me!
*'''Steven''': Um, that's a really weird fortune... Oh, wait! [[Jamie]]!
*'''Jamie''': Oh, Steven! The absolute calamity that's befallen us!
*'''Steven''': Oh... yeah, I guess things are kinda bad?
*'''Jamie''': What did you think of that reading? Too over the top? What's happening today is the real-life training scenario every actor dreams of! The DRAMA of it all!!
*'''Steven''': Ah. Yeah, I'd maybe dial it down just a hair.
*'''Jamie''': Perfect, thanks Steven!
*'''Steven''': Hey, [[Buck Dewey|Buck]]! Pretty crazy and amazing day, huh??
*'''Buck''': Sure. I guess so. Y'know, sometimes I envy you, Steven.
*'''Steven''': Me?
*'''Buck''': Yeah, you have a childlike sense of wonder what I no longer experience, due in large part to my way cynical worldview.
*'''Steven''': Oh... well, maybe I can fix it! I can't help you. ...because it's not about what I can do. It's about what YOU can do for yourself!
*'''Buck''': Wow. That's deep. You're right. Thanks, Steven. You've really opened up something inside me.
*'''Steven''': R-really? Cool!
*'''Buck''': Yes. Very cool.
*'''Steven''': Oh no! They're chopping down the all the trees! Not Mother Nature!! Wuh oh!
*'''Amethyst''': Um, that was weird. What was it?
*'''Steven''': I dunno, but I'm sure it'll come in handy dandy!
*'''Connie''': Wow, what is this?
*'''Steven''': OOH! OOH!
*'''Greg''': Yeah, ain't every day you see a big magical wall like this. What should we do now?
*'''Steven''': Let's beat it up! We need to find the magic key!
*'''Greg''': Oh, yeah! Doy! That makes sense! Looks like this isn't your first rodeo, Scthu-ball!
*'''Steven''': Haha, thanks, Dad! Hm, there's something about this sprout sure does seem vaguely magical and mysterious... Oooo...
*'''Greg''': That's good, right?
*'''Connie''': Looks like it! Let's find another one!
*'''Steven''': [[Onion]]?? What are you doing here?
*'''Onion''': ...
*'''Steven''': Oh? Are these, like, for sale? Uh. Cool! Hey!! Stop that! Whoops... sorry, lil guy!! Oh, heh, heh, fancy seeing you guys here... Guys!! I found another thingie!
*'''Connie''': Nice! You're on the roll!
*'''Steven''': Yeah!
*'''Amethyst''': Man oh man, we are on a roll! I mean, who needs P and G at this point? We've totally got this!
*'''Steven''': Hi, [[Yellowtail]]!
*'''Yellowtail''': ...
*'''Steven''': Bye, Yellowtail!
*'''Connie''': Steven, is that...
*'''Steven''': Light Me!!!
*'''Greg''': My Giant son! But wait... he's not giant anymore? He's just a wee lil guy now!
*'''Amethyst''': Mini-Ste! Haha!
*'''Steven''': It's like... this one's just a little glint! C'mere, Lil' Light Steven! GUYS, look at this! I found MORE vaguely magical stuff!
*'''Connie''': Incredible! The Prism must have created this too!
*'''Greg''': Wow. You really do experience some amazing stuff on your missions, kiddo. It's nice being here to share it with you. I hope you know you make your old man proud.
*'''Steven''': Aw, Dad!
*'''Greg''': And hey, are you hearing what I'm hearing? It sounds almost... musical! That's my department! I bet this lil magic wall wants to jam! Whoa nelly!
*'''Connie''': Mr. Universe! It's reacting to your guitar!
*'''Greg''': Okay, wall! How 'bout some of this action!
*'''Steven''': DAD! You just solve your first magic puzzle!!
*'''Greg''': Holy mackeral! I DID! Wow, I was hoping I'd be useful on this crazy adventure, but I figured it'd be more like making everyone breakfast or something!
*'''Steven''': That's my Dad! Now I'm the one who's proud!
*'''Greg''': Aw, shucks, thanks lil buddy!
*'''Pearl''': Steven! Everyone! Thank goodness you're alright!
*'''Steven''': PEEEAAARRLLL!!!
*'''Pearl''': Garnet told me what happened. Um, sorry about the car wash, Greg.
*'''Greg''': Ah, it's okay, really. Just glad no one was hurt. And, y'know, I'm rich and all, so I guess I'll just buy another one?
*'''Pearl''': Alright, well, you were all heading in the right direction. Her ship that went this way.
*'''Steven''': Pearl, do you know that Gem? Who is she?
*'''Pearl''': We're going to need to move fast to have any hope of catching up with her.
*'''Steven''': Wait! But...
*'''Pearl''': Steven, I need you to trust me.
*'''Steven''': You have to tell us who she is! Okay, I trust you.
*'''Pearl''': Thank you, Steven. Let's go, everyone!
*'''Steven''': Wow, I can't believe we're here again, journeying around the world, waging epic battles... Just another day at the office for the Crystal Gems! I should let the gang know how great they're doing! Amethyst, you're rocking it!
*'''Amethyst''': Thanks, duder! Nice pun, by the way!
*'''Steven''': Oh, haha! Totally intentional... Oh man, she went inside a weird triangle door! Was that always here? I wonder if Onion knew about it... Welp, I better tell the team! GUUUYYYSSSS!!! I saw the Gem! I know where she's going!
*'''Amethyst''': Radical! Let's do this!!
*'''Steven''': GUUUYYYS!
*'''Connie''': Secret door??
*'''Steven''': SECRET DOOOOOORR!!!
*'''Pearl''': You know the drill, Steven. Whenever we discover a big secret door like this, if we want to open it we need to...?
*'''Steven''': Sigh... find a key thingy to put in the slot.
*'''Pearl''': And remember: the item we need to open this door may not be in this area. We may have to return later.
*'''Steven''': Aw, man. That makes me feel like the Mayor of Bummertown. Gasp!
*'''Hessonite''': Hmmm.
*'''Steven''': (off-screen) HESSONITE!
*(Amethyst, Pearl, Steven and Connie arrives)
*'''Hessonite''': Mmm? Can it be... a Crystal Gem?! So, my Prism wasn't the only thing that managed to stay intact after the [[The Great Diamond Authority|Diamonds]]' retaliation! Was it you that activated MY Prism? No wonder the poor thing's so confused. You don't even know how to use properly use it! Let me show you how it's done. Mmmhmm! That should do the trick! Isn't this nostalgic! And here I thought the [[The Rebellion|war]] was over. Well, it will be now! Goodbye!
*'''Steven''': Oh man! That monster! It's... IT'S... DAVE!
*'''Connie''': Um, Steven? Did you just name the monster?
*'''Steven''': Urm, well, yeah! Doesn't it seem like a big monster like this needs a name?
*'''Pearl''': Get, ready, team!
*'''Steven''': Oh man, it looks mad!! Oh no...
*(Garnet arrives)
*'''Steven''': ...so cool...
*'''Garnet''': Hello, everyone.
*'''Steven''': Phew, that was one tricky pickle! Phew, thanks for the safe, Garnet! Wait... the Prism! Oh man, our Prism is in another castle! Wait a minute... that Homeworld Gem... you said her name was Hessonite! Dish??
*'''Amethyst''': Yeah, what's her deal?!
*'''Pearl''': It's a long story...
*'''Garnet''': She's a serious threat. We're going to need to act quickly. I know where we need to go. Let's head to a [[Wap Pad|warp pad]], team!
*'''Amethyst''': Wow, didn't think we'd end up back here again.
*'''Steven''': ...
*'''Pearl''': Alright, let's go everyone. We need to reach the [[The Forge|Forge]].
*'''Amethyst''': Uh, Steven? You look as pale as Pearl! Everything okay?
*'''Steven''': I'm... fine. We should keep moving.
*'''Garnet''': Leave this to me. Pow. To stand up against Hessonite, we'll need... a little upgrade. We've got another stop to make.
*'''Steven''': Ooh! Ooh! Future vision time??
*'''Garnet''': You know it. Let's head back to the warp pad.
*'''Steven''': Brrrr...
*'''Amethyst''': Feels fine to meeee!
*'''Steven''': L-let's-s d-d-o th-this! Urm, w-what is it we're actually doing here, again?
*'''Garnet''': You'll see. Let's head this way.
*'''Amethyst''': Uh, is someone ringing?
*'''Steven''': Oh, that's me... Myello?
*'''[[Peridot]]''': (On Smartphone) STEVEN!!!
*'''Steven''': Oh, hey Peridot! Is everything okay?
*'''Peridot''': (On Smartphone) No! Things are objectively not okay! It's the tactical battle simulator! The, what did you call it, "Are PEE GEE"?
*'''Steven''': Oh, the game I lent you? What's wrong with it?
*'''Peridot''': (On Smartphone) Yes! It's defective! No matter what I do, I can't progress.
*'''Steven''': Oh, that's okay! In an RPG, sometimes you just have to level up your guys before you can move forward.
*'''Peridot''': (On Smartphone) Level... up? Further experimentation is required. Peridot, out.
*'''Steven''': Oh, okay... good talk! SPA-SPA-SPA-SPACESHIIIIIP!
*'''Pearl''': That doesn't look like the same ship as before...
*'''Garnet''': Let's follow it and take it out anyway.
*'''Steven''': There it is agaaaaain! Mysterious spaceship is mysterious!!
*'''Pearl''': No time to waste!
*'''Steven''': Oh, another call! Steven Universe, speaking!
*'''Peridot''': (On Smartphone) Steven! You won't believe it! I LEVELLED UP!!
*'''Steven''': Aright!! Way to go, Peridot! I knew you could do it!
*'''Peridot''': (On Smartphone) Yes! And now I understand why you spend so much time with this silly leisure activity! At first it seemed to serve no functional purpose, but now! Now, well, it's addictive...
*'''Steven''': Haha, that's games for you!
*'''Pearl''': Steven? The mission?
*'''Steven''': Oh, uh, anyhoo... I'm sorta busy at the moment. Catch you later?
*'''Peridot''': (On Smartphone) Yes, I must acquire more of these "XP"s anyway. Goodbye, Steven! (Calls off)
*'''Sadie''': Wow, now that's a block of ice!! Thanks, Steven! I can always count on you. Here's one of those frozen donuts, on the house!
*'''Kiki''': Steven! Perfect timing! Get another pie that needs to go out. This one's for Onion. At least, I'm assuming it was him. The phone call was basically just strange unintelligible noises.
*'''Steven''': Yep, that's probably Onion.
*'''Jenny''': Oh, I just thought... nevermind. Woooow! This pizza cutter... I've never seen one so sharp! You're a lifesaver, Steven!! Here, this is for you!
*'''Vidalia''': Hey there! Still a work in progress... should be finished here soon.
*'''Steven''': Wow! It's gonna be so good!!
*'''Sour Cream''': Cool, you found some. But I really need all 10. I have this thing I do not that requires 10. People love it.
*'''Steven''': Oh. I guess that makes sense.
*'''Boltron''': You're looking good looking on both the outside AND the inside.
*'''Steven''': Aw, that's sweet!
*'''Boltron''': It's dangerous to go alone.
*'''Steven''': I'm... not sure what that's referring to?
*'''Boltron''': Check the prize dispencer below me!
*'''Steven''': Um, that's a really weird fortune... Oh, wait! Onion, did you order a pizza?
*'''Onion''': Mrrmramrrum?
*'''Steven''': I'll take that as a yes!
*'''Kiki''': Just got call for another delivery! This one needs to go to Amethyst.
*'''Steven''': Wait, like, our, Amethyst?
*'''Kiki''': Yeah, unless there's another Amethyst in Beach City?
*'''Steven''': Amethyst, did you order this pizza?
*'''Amethyst''': Yeah, dude! Thanks, I'm starving!!
*'''Steven''': We're supposed to be adventuring -- when did you even have time to order this?? and why did you have to pick it up instead of getting it yourself, anyway?
*'''Amethyst''': So I could share it with you! Here, have a slice!
*'''Steven''': Aw, well now it got sweet!
*'''Kiki''': Hey, Steven! Looks like I don't have any more deliveries for you. You should talk to my Dad again, though. You've been a big help... maybe he'll let you off the hook now?
*'''Steven''': Psst... Hey, Lion... Liiiioooonnn...
*'''Lion''': Zzzzz...
*'''Steven''': Just thought you should know we're on a pretty big-time adventure right now... If you wanted to wake up and join us, you're totally welcome to, y'know!
*'''Lion''': Zzzzz...
*'''Steven''': No problemo, I'll just check back later! Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey!
*'''Lion''': Zzzzz... ....? Zzzz...
*'''Steven''': Hmmm... Hey there, sleepyhead! Are you gonna stay awake this time?
*'''Lion''': ....
*'''Steven''': Looks like third time's a charm! ...
*'''Lion''': ...
*'''Steven''': Whoa! Nifty!! Thanks, Lion! Phew, things sure have been getting a bit hairy. I think the team could use a little pick-me-up! Garnet, you're the coolest!
*'''Garnet''': Thanks. But not as cool as a boy I know who wears a star shirt.
*'''Steven''': Hey! I know a star-shirted boy!
*'''[[Peridot (Squaridot)|Squaridot]]''': Log date 3-9-2. Charging station relocation attempt unsuccessful. Performing diagnostics to--
*'''Steven''': P-Peridot?! What are you doing here?? Did you beat that RPG already?
*'''Squaridot''': ...
*'''Steven''': Heyy, are those your old [[Limb Enhancers|limb enhancers]]? And what's with your hair?? Wait a minute! You're not Peridot!!! You're more like a... Squaridot!!
*'''Pearl''': She must be working with Hessonite! Don't move! You're not going anywhere!
*'''Squaridot''': Gems...on Earth?
*'''Steven''': Hey, so, Squaridot -- can I call you Squari? Look, this doesn't need to be a fight. My name's Steven, and--
*'''Squaridot'': A... Steven?
*'''Steven''': Man, I'm getting some serious deja vu from this.
*'''Squaridot''': That's enough talk from The Steven!! I have very clear orders in the event of this precise scenario! Witness my attack mode, Earth Gems! And the Steven! You outdated Gem tech cannot stand up against my battle ready half levi-sphere! -- freshly issued!! Haha! My commander will reward me handsomely for your defeat! Or perhaps, dare I even think it... Recognition from [[Yellow Diamond]] herself!! Prepare for hamulating defeat, you...you PEBBLES!! Such a nuisance!! This defeat is irrelevant! Once Homeworld receives word of this, they'll crush you like the pebbles you are!!
*'''Steven''': Man, this is just like how it went down with our Peridot. Wait a hot minute! If this is like last time... could this be the first step to a brand new friendship?! Yay! NEW FRIIIIIENND!! Oh man, can you imagine how much fun it'd be to have TWO Peridots around?!
*'''Pearl''': Urm, I think one might be plenty.
*(Garnet arrives)
*'''Garnet''': Let's chat.
*'''Squaridot''': GRRR!!!! By happenstance you MAY have subdued me and you MAY have commandeered my vessel, but I'll NEVER disclose my commander's whereabouts!
*'''Connie''': Hmm, whereabouts... By Jove! Maybe her ship's computer can track Hessonite?
*'''Pearl''': Impressive, Connie! Well, fixing this won't be easy. It's badbly damaged, and this modern gem tech is so
*'''Steven''': Y'knoooow... If only we had our OWN Peridot to fix something like this! Just kidding: we totally do. TO THE [[The Barn|BAAAARNNN]]!! Sorry it had to come to this, Squaridot!
*'''Squaridot''': I have nothing to say to you, The Steven!!
*'''[[Lapis Lazuli|Lapis]]''': Oh, hey everyone.
*(Peridot arrives)
*'''Peridot''': Steven!! Perfect timing! My party just reached level 3!! A-and-- Um, Steven. Who is... this...
*'''Steven''': Hehe, uh, Peridot... meet, Squaridot!
*'''Squaridot''': ...
*'''Peridot''': ...
*'''Steven''': Right, so, uh, this is awkward...
*'''Squaridot''': What are you doing here?! Where are your limb enhancers?! You're so... naked and detatched! What is the status of your assignment? We must report your whereabouts at once! (Unbelievable... hoe embarrassing thank the stars I'm not you.)
*'''Peridot''': I"M embarrassing?! Hahahaha! I think the word you're looking for is... "enlightened."
*'''Squaridot''': Enlightened?!
*'''Peridot''': Open your mind! Unhook from their machines! You don't have to do everything your superiors say! You don't have to do ANY of it!
*'''Squaridot''': But... that's treason... you mis-guided... PEBBLE!
*'''Peridot''': PEBBLE?! WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?!
*'''Steven''': Oh-hhho kay, you two, maybe we should break it up and--
*'''Peridot''': YOU'RE A SHALLOW STRATA, ZETA KINGDERGARTEN... CLOD!!!!!!!
*'''Squaridot''': CLOD?!! ME, a Clod?! You're the Clod, CLOD!!!!
*'''Peridot''': You're the CLODDIEST CLOD I'VE EVER SEEN, CLODDING AROUND! CLOD! CLODDD!!!!!!
*'''Pearl''': Wow. This is... something.
*'''Amethyst''': Hey Lapis, please tell me you've got some popcorn up there?
*'''Lapis''': Fresh out.
*'''Steven''': Guys! I get it! You're so different, but also the same! I know this must be like looking into some sort of weird, angry mirror... But I'm sure we can find some common ground, right? Wouldn't it be so much nicer if you could be Peri-pals?
*'''Squaridot''': Silence, The Steven. Your manipulate machinations are irrelevant. When my commander returns from the battlefield, she'll --
*'''Connie''': Battlefield? Hessonite's at a battlefield... could it be the [[Gem Battlefield|Strawberry Battlefield]]?
*'''Squaridot''': I-uh, urm...
*'''Peridot''': Hahaha! You've said too much!! Rookie mistake.
*'''Squaridot''': ... RRRR!!!!!!!
*'''Steven''': Garnet, help!!
*'''Garnet''': HAAA!!!!
*'''Peridot''': Well, that was disturbing to watch.
*'''Steven''': Awww man... so much for the Peri-pals.
*'''Garnet''': Now that that's through, let's take a look at that terminal.
*'''Pearl''': Yes, even if Hessonite's somewhere at the battlefield, we'll need the terminal to pinpoint her exact location. Peridot?
*'''Peridot''': Hrmm, this will take some time to repair. AND I'll need to collect some very specific materials in order to do it... That settles it!! I'M GOING WITH YOU!
*'''Steven''': Yay!! Our party grows!! Hey, Lapis! Do you wanna come too?
*'''Lapis''': Eh.
*'''Steven''': Are you suuure? It's a pretty exciting epic adventure we're going on! I'm sure everyone would love to have you be part of it!
*'''Lapis''': Thanks, but I'm good.
*'''Steven''': Aw, okie, dokie. Warp pad tiiiiime!
*'''Peridot''': Let's never speak of the Squaridot again, okay?
*'''Steven''': More like.... Squariclod!
*'''Peridot''': Ahahaha!! So fitting! Steven, your jokes always provide maximum hilarity!
*'''Connie''': It's pretty amazing how this type of stuff is our "normal", y'know?
*'''Steven''': That's... a good thing, right? Wouldn't have it any other way
*'''Connie''': Yeah, you know it!
*'''Peridot''': Shall we commence the mission?
*'''Garnet''': This has been a big mission so far. How are you holding up?
*'''Steven''': I'm just getting started! Could use a little nappy-poo...
*'''Garnet''': Hang in there, Steven. No more nodding off while we're using the warp pad.
*'''Steven''': Oh... you saw that??
*'''Garnet''': Time to go, Steven.
*'''Parl''': ...
*'''Steven''': Pearl? Everything okay?
*'''Pearl''': I'm fine. I -- it's just... Hessonite. She's...
*'''Steven''': No match for you!
*'''Pearl''': Ha, Steven, you're too sweet. As always. With four of us working together, hopefully that's true.
*'''Amethyst''': Pretty nutty stuff, eh? So anyway, whaddaya wanna do tonight after we're done with all this Prism business?
*'''Steven''': Let's go out for pizzas!! You think we'll finish our quest by tonight? Video game marathon!!
*'''Amethyst''': Awesome!! I knew I could count on you for a killer idea!
*'''Greg''': I've had some pretty crazy days in my time, kiddo, but this might just take the cake.
*'''Steven''': What about that time... ...we battled Lapis' water clones? ...we went to space?? ...we took out Two-Hundred Taco challenge?!
*'''Greg''': Haha, oh yeahh! Well, it's definitely a tossup between and today.
*'''Pumpkin''': Arf, arf!!
*'''Connie''': Um, Steven, this area looks more dangerous than the rest. If we run into trouble, we may want to consider coming back later when we're stronger?
*'''Steven''': Awww... alrighty! Adventuring with ma buds! I'm so lucky! Let's see, who looks like they need a good ol' fashioned warm-fuzzy... Peridot, you're the best!
*'''Peridot''': Thank you, Steven! Wait.. .the best what?
*'''Steven''': Oh, hmm... well, lots of stuff! You really good of making things. You tell really great jokes!
*'''Peridot''': This is... true! In that case, Steven, you are also the best!
*'''Lapis''': Hey, how's it going, Steven?
*'''Steven''': Oh! Pretty good... been a pretty busy adventure. You know how it goes.
*'''Lapis''': Alright. Yeah. I do. Cool.
*'''Sour Cream''': Thanks, man! You're going to make a great roadie one day. Here, let me repay you. I've got this thing that I think is a good Steven thing.
*'''Steven''': Yay! Man, it feels like we were just here!
*'''Pearl''': Hmm. Right... what is it with this place?
*'''Peridot''': Steven!! Look!!
*'''Steven''': Okay! Am... I looking at strawberries? Because there's lots of strawberries.
*'''Peridot''': No, no! Up there! That metal! It looks like Tungsten! I could use that to help with my repairs of the computer terminal! Wanna know how we're going to get it??
*'''Steven''': If we go get Lapis, she could fly us up there! I could use my floating ability! Using metal powers!
*'''Peridot''': Yes! Your answer is a commendable display of wisdom, Steven. The material is a bit too far away for my powers to reach. But luckily, this conveniently placed metal block isn't! Witness my usefulness!!! Nyahaha! I'm so relevant!! But sadly, this metal isn't enough. We'll need to find more. I'd say collecting approximately TEN total specimens of this size should do it. Then I can repair the terminal.And lead us directly to the Cold-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named!!
*'''Steven''': Cool! Well you're in luck, because I'm super good at collecting things!
*'''Peridot''': Peridot, you've done it again! You're objectively the most invaluable member of the Crystal Gems!!!! But this still isn't enough metal! Let's keep looking! Steven!! Are you.. leaving? We haven't found all the Tungsten in this area! You want me to finish my work on the terminal, right? Excellent! That seems to be all the tungsten in this area. Onward to the next one!
*'''Steven''': Well, if we're seeing all these new baddies, at least that probably means she's close? That's how it works in video games, anway.
*'''Peridot''': Such strange behavior for a Hessonite.
*'''Setven''': Really?
*'''Peridot''': Well, yeah. Hessonites are important military commanders. It wouldn't exactly be normal procedure for one to go around sightseeing! And if what you described is accurate, it sounds like she could be THE Hessonite. Making the whole thing even more ridiculous! Ha!
*'''Steven''': Whatchoo talkin' bout, Peri?
*'''Peridot''': Only one of the most legendary war heroes on Homeworld! Actually, now that I think about it... It was the war on THIS planet that made her famous! Wielding the Prism, she handily decimated countless rebellion fighters and--
*'''Pearl''': ...
*'''Peridot''': Oh, urm, what I meant to rely is: she should have more important things to do than travelling around the Earth like this.
*'''Steven''': Do you think she's using the Prism to build up her army again?
*'''Peridot''': Well, then she's one unorganized commander, leaving her troops all over in silly places like this!
*'''Steven''': Then what could she be up to? She came back to get the Prism, and now she has it! But she's going all over the world instead of leaving... or attacking.
*'''Peridot''': Well, I certainly wouldn't know.
*'''Steven''': Mysterious on top of mysterious!!
*'''Peridot''': That's it! This is enough to repair the terminal! And... there! Activate!
*'''Steven''': Yay!! So, what's it say?? Does it show where to find Hessonite?
*'''Peridot''': Indeed! Looks like she's at... The [[Ancient Sky Arena|Sky Arena]]? Huh. That's a peculiar place for her to--
*'''Steven''': Oh man, this one looks tough... It must be... THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE... DUKE OF STRAWBERRIES!!
*'''Amethyst''': Now THAT'S what I call a battle!
*'''Garnet''': Yes. Nice job with that one maneuver back there, Amethyst.
*'''Amethyst''': I know, right?! I was all, pssh, whoosh, bam, wha-krakk!!
*'''Peridot''': Ahem, as I was saying...
*'''Steven''': Oh yeah, where were we? Sky Arena! That's where the computer says she's currently located! Sooo... shall we?
*'''Boltron''': There's good times ahead in your future -- at the [[Funland Arcade]]!
*'''Steven''': That, uh, seems more like an advertisement than a fortune?
*'''Kofi''': STEEVENNN!
*'''Steven''': Ack! Yes??
*'''Kofi''': Thanks for being such a big help! You've impressed me.
*'''Steven''': Oh! Y-you're welcome!
*'''Kofi''': This is for you!
*'''Steven''': Ronaaaldoooo... guess what I have!
*'''Ronaldo''': STEVEN! Is it irrefutable evidence of a dark, alternate universe, inhabited by beings that can't even be observed by mortal eyes?!
*'''Steven''': Nope, but next best thing!! A really cool sword! For you!!
*'''Ronaldo''': Wow! It looks better than the one I spent my life savings on at [[DelmarvaCon]]!! Many thanks, Steven. Words cannot describe how much I value our fellowship!
*'''Steven''': Yay! I think this might be for you! Since you own a boat and all, that makes you a captain!
*'''Yellowtail''': ...
*'''Steven''': So... looks pretty mysterious and interesting... yeah? You wanna... tell me about it??
*'''Yellowtail''': ...
*'''Steven''': Uh, well, perhaps the mystery is more fulfilling than the actual contents could ever be?
*'''Garnet''': Steven, this area is more dangerous than the rest. If we run into trouble, we should run into trouble, we should return later once we're stronger.
*'''Steven''': Awww... alrighty!
*'''Hessonite''': Come on! Just... do it like you used to! Can't you access your memory of this place? I'll take you back to the site of every battle we won on this miserable planet, if that's what it takes! Try to remember! Things were so good back then! You were SO much stronger! WE were UNSTOPPABLE! I can't bring you back until we get this right!! A Prism that doesn't want to be a weapon... What would they say if they saw you like this? "Hessonite! What's wrong with your Prism"?! "Oh it just... activated for someone else, that's all!" No, no, NO! THAT FORM AGAIN!! Why are you still thinking of that tiny human?! How did it put these silly ideas into your fraction!! You don't belong to him! YOU. BELONG... TO ME!!!!!
*'''Steven''': No! We're here to -- Really?? Again!
*(Peridot arrives)
*'''Amethyst''': Gugh, Peridot, this is just like when we tried to hunt you down. But worse... cause, y'know she's actually threatening.
*'''Peridot''': Uh... thanks. Luckily, she doesn't know we're still tracking her! Though that's odd... she's returning to the Strawberry Battlefield. We were just there! This thing must need a reboot!
*'''Steven''': Wait isn't that... the location of the pyramid temple we blew up that one time??
*'''Peridot''': What's with you guys and blowing up ancient temples, anyway?
*'''Greg''': So... I guess we're heading back to that big crater?
*'''Steven''': Okay, that DEFINTELY wasn't here before!
*'''Pearl''': This... we never knew of this... Welp, here goes something!
*'''Steven''': I guess it's kinda interesting that another super secret pyramid was here the whole time... So you guys really didn't know about this?
*'''Pearl''': Like you said: top secret.
*'''Steven''': This place is so mysterious and dungeony! Oh man, what are we gonna call it??
*'''Amethyst''': You're going to name it now, aren't you?
*'''Steven''': Hmm... how about... Pyramid O' Peril. Yep, that's the one! It's official. Whoa.
*'''Hessonite''': Oh, look at this. Your new friends. Here to steal rightfully mine.
*'''Steven''': The Prism doesn't want to be with you! It doesn't want to be a weapon!
*'''Hessonite''': You! You're the one who ruined everything! How did you override my Prism?! All my customized settings... all our hard won battles... you've scrambled its memory!
*(Peridot and Amethyst arrives)
*'''Peridot''': HEY, you orange... fluffy... CLOD!!
*'''Amethyst''': Yeah!! We've fried bigger fish than you! How 'bout some of THIS!
*'''Steven''': NOOOO!!!
*(Garnet and Connie arrives)
*(Pearl arrives)
*'''Hessonite''': AH, the renegade Pearl.
*'''Pearl''': Hessonite... We clashed back then... ...you forced us back, but you never stopped us! I'll never let you win!
*'''Hessonite''': Yes you will. We both know you're in over your head. How about instead of a fight, you just come along with me? I think I deserve a Pearl by now! You know, I'm a bit of a legend. Even without my prism, I always win. ...No? Still want to fight? What a shame...
*'''Pearl''': For... [[Rose Quartz|Rose]]!
*'''Hessonite''': Rose!...
*'''Steven''': HEY, HESSONITE! Is this what you want?!
*'''Hessonite''': HAAA!!!!!
*'''Connie''': Ugh, my head...
*'''[[Sapphire]]''': Don't worry. You're going to be fine.
*'''Connie''': Garnet... you're... Sapphire! Steven! Where's Steven?
*'''Sapphire''': I cannot see him. However, we are being accompanied by the next closet thing.
*'''Connie''': One of the Lil' Light Stevens... And the others?
*(Peridot arrives)
*'''Peridot''': Never fear -- Peridot is here!! AND... look what I found!
*'''Connie''': The cheeseburger backpack!! ...Steven...
*'''Sapphire''': I can take us to the others. [[Ruby]] is with them.
*'''Connie''': Okay. We can't waste any time. Let's find them. Hey, Lil' Steven... Can you help us find actual Steven? Or your Prism?
*'''Lil' Prism Steven''': ...
*'''Connie''': You can't understand me, can you? Looking at your face... I... We've gotta find Steven.
*'''Sapphire''': This is the way. Now we must retrieve they keys to progress.
*'''Connie''': We're on it! Hey, Sapphire... Hessonite, she's...
*'''Sapphire''': Powerful.
*'''Connie''': Yes, and so... merciless.
*'''Ed''': Sorry about that. Um... I guess this is the nature of having an enemy.
*'''Sapphire''': Not all Homeworld Gems are this way. But yes, we must not forget what we're up against.
*'''Connie''': I won't let her get away with that she's done.
*'''Peridot''': Hehehehe!
*'''Connie''': Huh? What's so funny?
*'''Peridot''': Aren't we excited? We're so... INTEGRAL this time! No sitting around at home!
*'''Connie''': Aren't you worried about Steven? And the others?
*'''Peridot''': Worried? With us on the case?? We'll find him! And when we'll show that cloddy Hessonite that the [[Crystal Temps|New Crystal Gems]] mean business!!
*'''Connie''': Yeah! I like the sound of that!
*'''Peridot''': Yes!!! Can you believe it's once again up to the NEW CRYSTAL GEMS to save the day?? I knew it wouldn't be long before it came to this again! Haha! How lucky are they have us?!
*'''Sapphire''': Peridot?
*'''Peridot''': Urm, yes?
*'''Sapphire''': Best to focus.
*'''Peridot''': Oh... right.
*'''Connie''': C'mon, guys! Time to find out friends.
*'''Sapphire''': This way. Not much further now.
*'''Ruby''': ARGH!!!!!!
*'''Pearl''': Ruby... let's stay calm and think this through.
*'''Amethyst''': I'm with Ruby! Now seems like a pretty good time to start hitting things!!
*'''Ruby''': YEAH!!
*'''Pearl''': Sigh, you both know that won't get us anywhere.
*'''Amethyst''': I dunno. DO I know that?
*'''Greg''': Steven...
*'''Pearl''': Greg, it's going to be alright. We'll find him.
*'''Greg''': Yeah, I know... But... This little mini light Steven. I think it's trying to tell us something. Hey, wait!! Listen to your non-light father!! Pearl! Look at this! Gem stuff!
*'''Amethyst''': Hey, sometimes I know about Gem Stuff too! No one ever asks me...
*'''Pearl''': Let's see, it seems to say... "Look between the sun as it sinks into the sea. There you will find the color of the key."
*'''Greg''': I have no idea what that means. Sure does sound important, though.
*'''Ruby''': (off-screen) C'mooon, let's gooo!!
*'''Steven''': ...DAD! CONNIE?? And the Gems... they're looking for me! Hmm. How was I seeing them if I'm here... Also.. where is the blazes IS here?! Helloooo? Any mean light monsters about?? Anyone? Wow. Sparkly thing! I want to go there... Is that... YELLOW DIAMOND?? And Hessonite... Wow, this is like... some sort of home movie! A home-Homeworld movie!! Hey, another sparky! Man, I'm really starting to get sick of her. Although, she looks... happy. I don't like where this is going. Is that... ...Mom?? These visions... this was here On Earth! The Gem rebellion! ... This... this is...
*'''Connie''': (off-screen) STEVEN??
*(Steven woke up)
*'''Steven''': Connie!! Guys! ...Sapphire?? Where's the others?
*'''Sapphire''': They're close by. I can take you to them when you're ready.
*'''Steven''': O-okay. I'm okay. I can walk.
*'''Sapphire''': I know. I'm glad, Steven.
*'''Peridot''': See! I told you guys it'd all work out!!
*'''Connie''': Steven... are you sure you're okay?
*'''Steven''': Something happened to me. But I saw you guys! And I think... I somehow saw the Prism's memories...
*'''Connie''': What?
*'''Steven''': I saw when the Prism was with Hessonite thousands of years ago. I think I saw how she lost it.
*'''Sapphire''': We're here.
*'''Greg''': Steven!!
*'''Ruby''': SAPPHIRE!!
*(Sapphire and Ruby fuse into Garnet)
*'''Garnet''': Phew, what a relief. Looks like the gang's all back together again.
*'''Pearl''': Steven, are you hurt?
*'''Steven''': No... I'm fine, really. Just feeling... a little light-headed.
*'''Greg''': I think we need to get you some sunlight, kiddo. Um, any of you Gems have any idea how we're going to get out of this crazy place?
*'''Garnet''': Looks like we're going to need to work our way up.
*'''Amethyst''': Well, what are we standing around for? There's more adventuring to do!
*'''Steven''': Uh oh... hey, big guy...
*'''Amethyst''': Yeah, you know that's right!! And tell all your friends!!
*'''Peridot''': Well, what now? You know I lost the computer terminal during that fall, right?
*'''Steven''': Ugh......
*'''Connie''': Steven?
*'''Steven''': Sorry, it's just... my head is killing me. I--
*'''Hessonite''': What have we here...
*'''Connie''': Steven!!
*'''Steven''': Oh man... I think I saw her... somehow. It seemed like she was at the Forge!
*'''Peridot''': What? How could she find it? Homeworld didn't know about the Forge!
*'''Steven''': I dunno... but I guess there's only one way to find out?
*'''Pearl''': Steven, this area is more dangerous than the rest. If we run into trouble, we should return later once we're stronger.
*'''Steven''': Awww... alrighty! Welp, that's new...
*'''Garnet''': If she's here, it's for one reason only: to use the power of the Forge to upgrade the Prim's constructs.
*'''Connie''': Steven, how's your head?
*'''Steven''': Still sorta... wonkey. Like when I was seeing that stuff from the Prism... If I saw Hessonite... do you think she saw me? What if that's the reason she knew about the Forge??
*'''Garnet''': Steven, there's nothing you could've done to stop it.
*'''Steven''': Yeah...
*'''Connie''': Steven, it's...
*'''Steven''': ... Mom...
*'''Pearl''': Rose... I... didn't know about this room. Bismuth must have been working on this, before... I don't think Rose knew, either.
*'''Steven''': ... We should keep moving...
*'''Connie''': Oh, hey! It fits! But looks like part of this is still missing.
*'''Steven''': Ugh , my head.. Oh man, not again!!
*'''Hessonite''': (off-screen) Looks like we'll do this the hard way.
*'''Steven''': I saw her again! She's using the Forge to make the Prism stronger somehow!!
*'''Pearl''': Somehow?
*'''Steven''': Yeah, I mean... Beats me how any of this wacky Prism stuff works! This is it! Hessonite was standing right over there!
*'''Greg''': Hm, well she isn't here now...
*'''Amethyst''': Surprise, surprise.
*'''Steven''': ...but those guys are definitely are!
*'''Amethyst''': That ain't good.
*'''Greg''': What do we do now??
*'''Steven''': Agghhh...
*'''Connie''': Steven!!
*'''Steven''': Prism vision... happening... again... So useful... yet, so painful... agh!
*'''Connie''': Steven, are you okay? Are you back with us?
*'''Steven''': Yeah... and I saw more mega important stuff. She didn't go back to Homeworld. She flew to a super ginormous ship, floating just above the Earth!
*'''Amethyst''': Oh man! How are we going to follow her now? Is this the end of the line? Game over, man! Game over!
*'''Steven''': Hmmm... I know a very large, very fluffy pink friend who just might be able to assist us... Uh, it's Lion, in case that wasn't obvious. To Beach City!!!! LIIIIIIOOOOOONNNNNN!!!!
*'''Lion''': Zzzz...
*'''Steven''': Look, buddy, you're probably having that great dream again where you ate all the ice cream in the world, but we really need your help! Could you do us a solid, and lend us some of that patented Lion warpy magic?
*'''Garnet''': Steven, this is it. Are you ready to go?
*'''Steven''': Ready, Freddy!
*'''Garnet''': Here we are.
*'''Steven''': Thanks, Lion! You know you my boo.
*'''Citrine Guard''': (off-screen) Hey... Did you just hear something?
*'''Garnet''': Those are Citrine Guards behind that door. Best not to alert them.
*'''Connie''': Steven, no matter what happens, we really shouldn't let my parents know I went to space.
*'''Garnet''': Hessonite. There's no escaping this time!
*'''Hessonite''': The day we evacuated this planet, I had to get my troops out so quickly... so fast... there was no way to go back for it. No time. Why did we have to leave so quickly, if the Crystal Gems were just going to survive?! WHY did I leave my Prism... only for someone like you to steal it?!
*'''Steven''': Hessonite. Listen to me. The Prism, it doesn't...
*'''Hessonite''': Don't you dare tell me what you think it wants! Look at you, acting as though you have the moral high ground! You're a thief. You stole my property. You took my great weapon, and you broke it! Well... ha ha, you'll be relieved to know I've finally fixed it now. Isn't that right?
*'''The Prism''': Yes. I belong to Hessonite.
*'''Hessonite''': You see? Now then, what's an appropriate punishment for theft and unauthorized activation for a Prism? Hm... I think... killing you, with that very same Prism. Yes, that seems VERY appropriate.
*(The Prism transform into Spectral Conclusion)
*'''The Prism: Spectral Conclusion''': ...
*'''Steven''': Hessonite, please stop! Prism! It's me, Steven!
*'''The Prism: Spectral Conclusion''': ...
*'''Steven''': I'm here to save you!
*'''The Prism: Spectral Conclusion''': I belong to Hessonite. ...
*'''Steven''': I know you don't have to be like this!
*'''The Prism: Spectral Conclusion''': ...
*'''Steven''': Hessonite is bad! Don't listen to her! Is this really what YOU want?
*'''The Prism: Spectral Conclusion''': ...
*'''Hessonite''': End this! Now! Destroy STEVEN!
*'''The Prism: Spectral Conclusion''': ...
*'''Hessonite''': UNBELIEVABLE! You're STILL listening to him!? Looks like I'll just have to deal with them myself.
*(The Prism: Spectral Conclusion transform back into The Prism)
*'''Hessonite''': ... it's me that's defective. I was supposed to be perfect. They always said I would be. I knew it wasn't true. I needed the Prism. Not the other way around. I lost it. I left it here. And now I can never get it back. Of course it activated for someone else. You... It should just belong to you. Take it.
*'''Steven''': Okay. No! It doesn't belong to anyone! It should be free to make his own choices! Did you heart that, Prism? What DO you want?
*'''The Prism''': I want to stay on Earth.
*'''Steven''': Light Steven! I knew you were still in there!
*'''Steven''': Light Steven! It's good to see you again! But... You don't have to keep being me! You can just be... You!
*'''Hessonite''': You're a wise little creature, aren't you? Such an amazing end. For thousands of years I wanted nothing more than to have it back. But now, here it is, and... Ha. I'm leaving it again.
*'''Garnet''': Hessonite. We can't let you leave here.
*'''Hessonite''': Let me? Ha! Maybe I'm not what they said I was. Or maybe I am. It's now my chance to go find out.
*'''Garnet''': Hmmm...
*'''Steven''': You guys! We did it! We SAVED LIGHT STEVEN!!!! C'mon buddy! Whaddya say we get you home?
*'''Connie''': I like the sound of that!
*'''Peridot''': Well, we did it, team! But there's still one VERY important thing left to do...
*'''Steven''': Uh oh! Did we forget something??
*'''Peridot''': Yes! It's my other adventure... The ARE PEE Gee game!! I finished it, but there's still more to do! Now I NEED to clear it to 100% completion!! Who's with me?!
*'''Steven''': Haha! Yeah!
*'''Connie''': Steven, the Prism!
*'''Steven''': Oh, Prism!!! I'm so happy you're finally free! What do you think you wanna do now? Travel the world? Start a small business? Finally catch up on that book you've been reading??
