{{TD||(''[[Pearl]] and [[Amethyst]], both wearing life jackets are seen sitting in a [[Minor Objects/Vehicles#Inflatable Raft|life raft]] in the middle of the ocean.

{{TD|Pearl| *looking over the edge of the life raft, with visible bags under her eyes* Guh! This isn't getting us anywhere.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *sleepily* What's the matter, Pierogi? You tired?}}
{{TD|Pearl| *annoyed* I don't get tired, I get results.}}
{{TD||(''Steven is looking from side to side underwater. He begins to gargle and reaches for his neck as he begins to run out of air. Wiggling his legs, he attempts to signal to Amethyst that he needs to be pulled up.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *speaking slowly with visible bags under her eyes* Was the sign for "pull me up" one wiggle or two?}}
{{TD|Pearl| Amethyst, stay focused!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst lets go of Steven's legs and shrugs at Pearl's response.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| *searching the water, using her gem as a flashlight* For all we know, [[Lapis Lazuli|Lapis]] and [[Jasper|Jasper's]] [[Malachite|fusion]] could be right under our noses! *gasps as something appears beneath the surface*}}
{{TD||(''Steven floats to the surface of the water with the aid of his life jacket. He gasps for air, spits a fish out of his mouth, then grabs it midair.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| ''This'' is why we wear life jackets. *throws the fish away*}}
{{TD|Pearl| Ah! A-are you alright?!}}
{{TD||(''[[Garnet]] then emerges from underneath Steven, picking him up and climbing back on the raft.'')}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]| *sighs* Nothing.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet tosses Steven onto the raft, and he starts flopping around like a fish out of the water.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| Ugh, it ''feels'' like we've been searching for light years!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Uh, light years measure light, not years. *pokes Steven's stomach, causing him to spit out another fish*}}
{{TD|Pearl| *throws her hands up in exasperation* Guh! *tries to lean on the side of the raft but slips* And I'm sick of these... ''life... diapers!''}}
{{TD|Steven| Safety is no punchline, Pearl. *gets up and grabs a nearby life jacket to give to Garnet*}}
{{TD|Garnet| Safety is our job. We must find Jasper and Lapis. As it stands, their fusion is a ticking time bomb. *throws the life jacket Steven gave to her overboard and summons her own*}}
{{TD|Steven| *worried* Is... Lapis gonna be okay?}}
{{TD|Garnet| She had control when she used her power to drag their fusion into the ocean. ''But'', a fusion like theirs is unstable, bound together by anger and mistrust. If that bond snaps, their anger will take over, and ''destroy''.}}
{{TD|Steven| *getting visibly tired* Don't worry, Lapis, we won't let you sleep with the fishes... *yawns*}}
{{TD|Garnet| We're gonna have to keep looking. But first, let's bring Steven home. *looks at Steven fast asleep in the raft*}}
{{TD|Steven| *abruptly wakes up* Huh, wha—? *stands up, one eye slightly closed in grogginess and drooling slightly* No, I'm— I'm— I'm fine! Let's— let's go fishing! *walks over the edge of the raft, sleepily mumbling" First one to catch something wins... *falls over the edge*}}
{{TD|Garnet| *quickly catches Steven before he falls into the water* I win.}}

{{TD||(''The Gems, now without their life jackets, brings Steven back home through the front door.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| We should be out there, searching! Not in here, ''not'' searching!}}
{{TD|Steven| *quoting himself* "Sleep is a curse, and yet a curse I need to live." -Steven Universe.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Steven isn't like us. He needs rest.}}
{{TD|Steven| Don't you guys need rest too? You look exhausted.}}
{{TD||(''Steven gazes at the visibly exhausted Gems: Garnet's face is lined with creases, Amethyst is drooling slightly with her face squashed down, and Pearl is squinting with her hair disheveled.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| *voice strained by her stiff face* We look awesome.}}
{{TD|Steven| *walks over to the couch* Look, you can't really knock sleep until you try it. *picks up some cushions* And maybe we can throw a little fun into the mix, with- *throws the cushions on the floor* A slumber party!}}
{{TD|Pearl| *eye twitching, disgusted* ''Fun''?}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah! All of us together, peacefully dozing off. *lies on the cushions* It'll be like there ''isn't'' a vengeful fusion boiling the ocean with hatred.}}
{{TD|Garnet| *walks over to Pearl and Amethyst, putting her hands on their shoulders" Steven's right. You should stay here and relax. But I'm going. *straining with her teeth clenched* Because I'm ''always'' relaxed.}}
{{TD|Pearl| But, Garnet, you couldn't possibly search the ocean by yourself! Let me— uh, let ''us'', help you! *pumps her fist in the air* We're a team!}}
{{TD|Garnet| ''No'', right now you're a party. A slumber party. *walking backwards toward the [[Warp Pad]]* Steven, put these Gems to bed. Don't stay up too late. There's snacks in the fridge. Bye. *warps off*}}

{{TD|Steven| Now, before we get our slumber party started, would any of you care for a slumber companion? *picks up a tray of three different stuffed toys*}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *kindly declines Steven's offer* I'm good. *flops over onto her stomach and quickly falls asleep, snoring loudly*}}
{{TD|Steven| *nods in approval at Amethyst and turns to Pearl* Pearl?}}
{{TD|Pearl| *declines the offer too* I'll pass on the slumber pals.}}
{{TD|Steven| Okay! *walks off with the tray* Sleep it up, then!}}
{{TD|Pearl| Oh! Right. *sits cross-legged and eyes half closed* Is... this right?}}
{{TD|Steven| No, you should lay down.}}
{{TD|Pearl| I get it now. *turns to lie down on her chest and puts up a pillow beneath her chin* Am I doing it?}}
{{TD|Steven| Well, that's ''way'' better than before. *sits near Pearl* But close your eyes all the way.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Okay. *closes her eyes* Alright. *nods her head* I'm sleeping now. I'm sleeping.}}
{{TD|Steven| You can't talk while you sleep.}}
{{TD|Pearl| *opens her eyes and glares at Steven* How is this even supposed to work?!}}
{{TD|Steven| It's easy! *flops onto his stomach* You just lie down, get nice and comfy. *puts his arms under his head* Don't move... And don't... think about... aaaaanything...}}

Canned applause plays as a narrator talks over the scene.'')}}
{{TD|Narrator| ''[[Steven Universe (TV series)|Steven Universe]]'' was filmed before a live studio audience.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Oh my goodness, [[Connie Maheswaran|Connie's]] going to be here any second now! I can't believe it, your first school dance! *adjusts Steven's bow tie* Let me just fix your tie, and—}}
{{TD|Amethyst (''off-screen'')| Stop fussing over Steven like a baby!}}
{{TD||(''Canned laughter is played, as Amethyst, dressed like a stereotypical masculine older sibling, rides down the stairs on a skateboard.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| Amethyst! What did I tell you about riding that thing in the house?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *rides past on her skateboard and waves at Steven* Have fun at your dance, dude! *rides up the stairs* Bunga-cowa!}}

{{TD|Garnet| Chille tid! *grins*}}
{{TD|Steven| Oh! Hi, Garnet!}}
{{TD|Garnet| *walks into the house* Hey Steven. You gotta come to the beach tonight! There's gonna be this ''huge'' bonfire party thing.}}
{{TD|Steven| I can't go to that! I'm going to the ''big dance'' with Connie!}}

{{TD||(''Steven opens the door to reveal [[Lapis Lazuli]]. In contrast to the black and white atmosphere, Lapis is in full color. Water is eerily flowing out of her eye sockets and open mouth. She looks up in silence, from the water sloshing from her eyes and mouth.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Lapis?}}
{{TD||(''Dimly colored blue eater rushes past Steven's feet onto the floor. Behind Lapis, a wave rises out of the water, casting a shadow over Steven. Steven looks up in horror, as the wave rises above Lapis' head, standing completely still.'')}}

{{TD|Steven| Oh, man. I fell asleep and had this weird dream. I opened the door, and Lapis was there, and—}}

{{TD|Steven| *stares at Pearl* ...You've never had a dream before, huh?}}
{{TD|Pearl| Uh... I don't think so.}}
{{TD|Steven| Well, Pearl, dreams don't always make sense. *slumps to the floor* When you dream, the thoughts in your head get all mixed up into a weird movie. And they're really hard to explain, which is why they're boring to listen to. Like *sigh* this one time, I had a dream, where, like, these things... were being sold at the [[Big Donut]], right? But the front door of the Big Donut shop led to the back of my dad's van?}}

{{TD|Steven| I had... another dream about Lapis.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Oh, that's okay! *throws her arms in the air* Dreams aren't real! They're just "mixed up movies"!}}
{{TD|Steven| But I-I think I was talking to her.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Wait. How do you know?}}
{{TD|Steven| I don't, but... I could just ''feel'' it. She was yelling, and... she was really freaked out.}}
{{TD|Pearl| What did she say? Is she still in control?}}
{{TD|Steven| I... I don't know.}}
{{TD||[Time Skip - Later That Night]}}
{{TD|Pearl| Steven, you could be using your dreams to connect with her mentally.}}
