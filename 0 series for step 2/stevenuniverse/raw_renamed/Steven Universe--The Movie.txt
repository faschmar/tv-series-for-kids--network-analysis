{{TD|White Diamond|Once upon a time, the [[Gem Homeworld]] was ruled by Diamonds: White, Yellow, Blue, and the littlest Diamond, [[Pink Diamond|Pink]]. While the other Diamonds conquered many worlds across the galaxy, Pink had only one - the planet [[Earth]]. One day, Pink fled the comforts of Homeworld. On Earth, she made a [[Rose Quartz|new home]], [[Crystal Gems|new friends]], and finally, new life; giving up her form to bequeath her [[Gemstones|gem]] to her half-human son. Without Pink, [[Gems|Gemkind]] entered an era of despair. But, when Steven Universe learned of his heritage, he reunited with his fellow Diamonds and championed a [[Gem Homeworld#Era 3|new era]] of peace and freedom across the furthest reaches of space. *shuts the book* And now, dear Gems everywhere, I'm pleased to announce that Steven is finally ready to take his rightful place on Pink Diamond's throne!}}
