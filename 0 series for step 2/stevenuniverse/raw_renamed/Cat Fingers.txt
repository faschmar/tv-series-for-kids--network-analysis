{{TD|Steven|Hubbing it up! *rubs the van's hubcaps vigorously*}}
{{TD|Greg|Hub it good! This is a high-profile job.}}
{{TD|Steven|You mean cause it's the mayor's election-mobile?}}
{{TD|Greg|If we do this right, we might get political favors!}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm not sure what that is, but I like it! *grabs a nearby hose*}}
{{TD||(''Steven turns on the hose to spray the van, but the water arches over the van and splashes onto Greg by mistake. Greg laughs and sprays back at Steven with his hose, starting a water fight. [[Bill Dewey|Mayor Dewey]] then walks in towards them.'')}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey|Hey, hey, hey! I'm not paying for father-son bonding here! (''Steven sprays him with his hose.'') Universe! Control that kid! *tries to wipe the water off himself*}}
{{TD|Greg|Steven! *holds Steven close to him* Hehe, I'm sorry, Mayor Dewey. Hehehe, this one's on the house.}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey|*examining his van* On the house, eh? I like the way you do business, Universe.}}

{{TD|Amethyst|Haha! Got you guys!}}
{{TD|Steven|Amethyst!}}
{{TD|Greg|Uh, pretty cool, Amethyst.}}
{{TD|Steven|Really cool! I wish I could shapeshift like you!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*ties hose into a knot* You could probably learn.}}
{{TD|Steven|Really?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Sure. *lifts up Steven's shirt* You've got a [[Gemstone|gem]].}}
{{TD|Greg|Whup! Magic stuff! Should I get out of here? Is there going to be an explosion?}}

{{TD|Pearl|*smiles* Well, of course--}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*shapeshifts into Pearl and interrupts Pearl* Well, of course I can. I'm perfect! *smacking her butt* WOMP, WOMP!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl shoves Amethyst to the side and Amethyst tumbles away laughing.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|All [[Gems]] have shapeshifting powers, Steven. *projects some holograms* We can turn into objects, we can change parts of our bodies or... we could do that. *looks at Amethyst*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*still smacking her butt* WOMP, WOMP!}}
{{TD|Steven|I want to try it all!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Don't bite off more than you can chew, Steven.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|WOMP, WOMP!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Ugh! *leaves through the front door, and Amethyst shapeshifts back into herself*}}
{{TD|Steven|Alright! Show me how to change into a, uh, huge [[lion]]!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Actually, for once Pearl is right. If you're gonna do this, you've gotta start with something easy. }}
{{TD|Steven|Like that cat you turned into?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|That sounds good. Now follow my lead. *begins demonstrating for Steven* First, think of what you wanna be, and then, just shake it out. *shapeshifts into the cat* See? Haha! Now your turn.}}
{{TD|Steven|Okay. *take a deep breath and starts straining himself* Caaaaat...}}

{{TD||[Trans. Ext. It's a Wash]}}
{{TD|Steven|Dad, I'm back!}}
{{TD|Greg|*is suntanning outside* Hey, schtu-ball.}}
{{TD|Steven|Check it out!}}
{{TD||(''Steven shows the cat finger to his dad. Greg reacts in shock, hurling a water bottle which hits Steven on the head. Water splashes from the bottle onto the cat finger and it cowers, as if it got burned.'')}}

{{TD|Greg|Can't you make them go away?}}
{{TD|Steven|I tried, but it made it worse! (''More cats keep growing.'')  Ohh, my life is over! I can't go on magic adventures! I can't even open the fridge! And I'll never get to have another water fight with you, Dad! Because these things hate... ''water!'' They hate water! Dad, spray me again!}}

{{TD||[Trans. Int. It's a Wash]}}
{{TD||(''Greg, determined, flips three switches and presses a button, activating the super-wash. Steven then crawls into the car wash. The jets spray Steven with water on all sides, causing the cats to meow in agitation. He then goes through a pair of waxers and another set of jets. Greg watches worriedly as Steven goes through the wash. He then rushes to the exit of the car wash and picks up a hose, ready to spray off any remaining cats. Steven then emerges from the wash, his clothes all torn up, but back to normal.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Ah!}}
{{TD|Steven|Dad... we did it.}}
{{TD||(''Steven realizes one of his fingers is still a cat and starts screaming. Greg screams too and sprays it with the hose. The cat finger disappears, and the two sighs in relief.'')}}

{{TD|Pearl|Steven! *climbs onto the dock and examines his hand* Okay, let me see it. Whe-? Y-you got them to go away. (''Steven smiles.'') It just goes to show, always listen to me, and never listen to Amethyst.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|That's fair.}}
{{TD|Garnet|It goes to show, you should have a little more faith in Steven. (''Pearl blushes.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah, that would have been a total "cat"-tastrophe!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst and Pearl forces a laugh.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|But I'm feeling much better "meow"!}}
{{TD||(''The Gems groan.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Ehhh? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?}}
{{TD|Garnet|Okay, that's enough. (''The Gems walk away.'')}}
