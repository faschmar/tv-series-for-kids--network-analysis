{{TD||(''Garnet and Steven warp back onto the [[Crystal Temple]] [[Warp Pad]], with Steven still traumatized back [[Steven's Dream|what happened]] in Korea.'')}}
{{TD|[[Steven]]|This can't be happening.}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]|Steven! You're back!}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]|Hey, Steve-O.}}
{{TD|Pearl|We're so sorry about earlier-}}
{{TD|Steven|Forget that! We have to catch up with her!}}
{{TD|Pearl|What!?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Who?}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]|[[Blue Diamond]].}}
{{TD|Pearl|Blue Diamond!? *starts panicking* O-O-On [[Earth]]!?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Holy smokes! They're all coming out of the woodwork.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Amethyst, turn into a chair. I-I need to sit down.}}
{{TD|Steven|She took [[Greg Universe|Dad]]! She alien-abducted him, and it's all my fault!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|She took Greg!?}}
{{TD|Pearl|Our Greg?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|What other Greg is there!? How are we gonna get him back!?}}
{{TD|Steven|What did she even want him for? To eat him!? T-to put him in a zoo!?}}
{{TD|Pearl|Wait. That might be it.}}
{{TD|Steven|*gasps* ''She's gonna '''eat him!?'''''}}
{{TD|Pearl|What? No. But there was a... No. No, it couldn't possibly still exist. Not since we-}}
{{TD|Garnet|That's right! [[Pink Diamond|Pink Diamond's]] insidious [[Pink Diamond's Zoo|human zoo]].}}
{{TD|Steven|What?}}
{{TD|Garnet|During her reign on Earth, Pink Diamond stole humans from their families as ''trophies'' of her conquest.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|You gotta be kidding.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Oh no. It was very serious. When I still served... *glances away for a moment* ...[[Gem Homeworld|Homeworld]], I saw it myself. A private menagerie deep in space. Humans in captivity. We were never able to rescue them. We had no way to get to them after [[The Rebellion|the war]]. But, that was over 5,000 years ago.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|You really think Greg's there?}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven, Blue Diamond wanted him alive?}}
{{TD|Steven|Yes! Yes! She liked him!}}
{{TD|Pearl|I can't think of anywhere else she'd put him if she wanted to keep him, that is if the zoo's still there.}}
{{TD|Steven|It's our only chance! But, how are we going to get there?}}
{{TD|Garnet|With the [[Roaming Eye]].}}
{{TD|Amethyst|The [[Minor Characters/Gems#Rubies|Ruby]] ship?}}
{{TD|Garnet|That's right. We're going into space, and we're not coming back without Greg.}}
{{TD||Trans. Ext. [[The Barn]]}}
{{TD||(''The [[Crystal Gems]] arrive at the barn, and Peridot is seen inspecting the interior of the Roaming Eye.'')}}
{{TD|[[Peridot]]|Let's see. Rear pulsar trackers are tracking pulsars. The atmosphere shield seems functional, but you're not going to need that in space, obviously.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Well, make sure it is safe for Steven.}}
{{TD|Peridot|He should be fine. But, I think I should go in and change the system preferences the Rubies set. How do you feel about green lights instead of red?}}
{{TD|Steven|There's no time for that! If it works, then let's just do it already!}}
{{TD||(''Steven walks towards the barn while talking to [[Connie Maheswaran|Connie]] on [[Steven's Phone|his phone]].'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Sorry, Connie, but we just can't wait. Dad's in trouble, and we need to go into space to get him back. There's no time. We're going right now. ...Just protect [[Beach City]] while we're gone.}}
{{TD|Pearl|So, if I input the coordinates, it will take us right there?}}
{{TD|Peridot|It's a little more complicated than that. These aren't your Era 1 light kites. You're gonna be pretty much ''bending reality'' if you turn on the gravity engine. Come to think of it, I should really change the Ruby preferences on that, too.}}
{{TD|Steven|So what, so it's red! Come on! Come on! We gotta go! *gets in the ship*}}
{{TD|Pearl|Rubies aside, will it fly?}}
{{TD|Peridot|Short answer, yes.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Okay, let's go! *gets in the ship with Pearl*}}
{{TD|Garnet|[[Lapis Lazuli|Lapis]], Peridot, stay here. You'll have to protect Beach City if something happens while we're gone.}}
{{TD||(''Lapis gives a thumbs-up.'')}}
{{TD|Peridot|You can count on us!}}
{{TD||(''Garnet gets into the ship, shutting the hatch, and the Roaming Eye begins flying into space. Pearl pilots the ship while Steven watches Earth shrink in distance.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Don't worry, Dad. We're on our way. *keeps gazing into space* I hope you got to see some of this. There's enough out here for a whole album about the cosmos.}}
{{TD||(''Suddenly, the ship starts rumbling.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Space turbulence!}}
{{TD||(''The Roaming Eye encounters an asteroid field. Pearl begins skillfully piloting the ship around the incoming asteroids.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Sweet moves.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Hold on.}}
{{TD||(''Pearl navigates the Roaming Eye until it exits the asteroid field.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Alright. How much further till we get to- Uhh!}}
{{TD||(''Suddenly, [[Ruby (Doc)|Doc]], still stuck in space, collides into the ship's windscreen, before rolling away. The ship then collides into [[Ruby (Navy)|Navy]] and [[Ruby (Army)|Army]], who are trying to grab each other's hands, and they roll away too.''}}
{{TD|Steven|Sorry, Rubies.}}
{{TD|Garnet|We should really do something about them.}}
{{TD|Steven|We can pick them up on the way back. Dad comes first. How much longer till we get there?}}
{{TD|Pearl|Well, at our current speed, we should be reaching the human zoo in... approximately seventy human years! Just in time for Greg's 110<sup>th</sup> anniversary of being alive.}}
{{TD|Steven|Pearl, my dad's not healthy enough to live that long.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Ehh... Do you think he'll be able to make it to 109?}}
{{TD|Garnet|Before we left, Peridot did mention the gravity engine.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Oh yeah. She said it bends reality.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Oh, I'm sure she was exaggerating. It probably just alters the definition for speed by manipulating space-time, but what effect would that have on organic matter? It might flatten Steven's body into a pancake of skin and bones.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Eww, bones are gross.}}
{{TD|Garnet|''You'' have bones in your bedroom.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|That's different. Those are ''my'' bones.}}
{{TD|Steven|If being a pancake means saving my dad, then bring on the syrup!}}
{{TD||(''Steven slams his palm onto the control panel, activating the gravity engine. Steven screams as the ship speeds up drastically, causing him to black out.'')}}
{{TD||[Time-Skip]}}
{{TD||(''Steven lays unconscious next to the captain's seat, until the Gems starts calling out to him, waking him up.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven! Are you okay?}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm fine. I-I think I just blacked out. Umm.. Are you guys okay?}}
{{TD||(''The activation of the gravity engine happens to flatten the Gems instead of Steven. Amethyst starts giggling at her peculiar appearance.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|You tell me.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Uhh... ''NO!'' We're ''NOT'' okay!}}
{{TD|Steven|Uhh, why do you guys look like that?}}
{{TD|Garnet|The gravity warp seems to be affecting our bodies.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Please tell me this lasts forever.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Our bodies are made of light, and usually, they form a mass dependent on the air pressure and the level of gravity in the environment. But we're in a situation, where the normal laws of physics don't apply.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Who cares? It's funny.}}
{{TD|Pearl|In ''what'' way is this ''funny!?''}}
{{TD|Steven|So, you guys aren't doing this on purpose? Can't you shapeshift back?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Hold on. *shapeshifts into [[Purple Puma]], yet remaining the same height* Huh, check it out. Puma cub.}}
{{TD|Garnet|The ship seems to be putting out some kind of energy, keeping us in this shape.}}
{{TD|Steven|*ponders for a bit and turns to the control panel* Oh, I know the problem.}}
{{TD|Pearl|You do?}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst shapeshifts back to normal.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Peridot said the ship was calibrated for Rubies. It must be making you all Ruby-sized.}}
{{TD||(''An imaginative projection of [[Ruby]] appears next to the Gems, indicating their heights relative to her.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Ugh! Why doesn't she tell us anything? This is why we don't listen to her.}}
{{TD|Steven|Maybe I can change the settings.}}
{{TD||(''Steven turns the calibration like a slot machine. It stops at three bulky figures, and the Gems turn [[Quartzes|Quartz]]-sized.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|No.}}
{{TD||(''Steven turns the calibration again, stopping at three tiny figures. The Gems instantly shrink into [[Pebbles|Pebble]]-sized in mid-air and fall onto the floor.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Nope.}}
{{TD||(''Steven turns the calibration again, stopping at three diamonds. The Gems quickly grow into [[The Great Diamond Authority|Diamond]]-sized and hit their heads on the ceiling.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Sorry!}}
{{TD|Garnet|This isn't working.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst starts snickering at the antics.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Try adjusting it manually.}}
{{TD||(''Steven taps on the screen to open the manual calibration menu, consisting of various symbols unknown to Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Woah! Umm... Maybe this one?}}
{{TD||(''Steven made a few manual adjustments, which causes the necks of the Gems to become long and unstable.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Okay, so that does that. Uhh... Maybe this one.}}
{{TD||(''Steven made another manual adjustment, causing the limbs of the Gems to become long and unstable as well.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Agh! Why is this so complicated!?}}
{{TD||(''Steven starts to tapping randomly at the calibration. The Gems momentarily return back to normal, before Garnet is flattened into a pancake and Pearl bloated up like a ball. Garnet and Amethyst chase after Pearl as she rolls away, when Amethyst grumbles in nausea and her body extends into a long sausage.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*slithers up to Steven* Hey, Steven! this is getting a little weird, even for me.}}
{{TD||(''Steven continues to tapping the calibration at random, until an large red "X" error message pops up.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|I think I found the off-switch!}}
{{TD||(''Steven slams his hands on the red "X" and everything turns into a red hue inside the ship. The Roaming Eye begins going into hyperdrive, forcing Steven back on his seat and the Gems onto the wall, seemingly retreated back into their [[Gemstones|gemstones]].''}}
{{TD|Steven|Guys! Wha- What did I do!?}}
{{TD||(''The Roaming Eye keeps accelerating into a ludicrous speed, creating visual wormholes in the fabric of space and overwhelming Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*gasps* Amethyst!? Garnet!? Pearl!? Where are you!? *turns to see only the gemstones* What happened? Are you cracked!? Uhh, Amethyst is usually back by now!}}
{{TD||(''The screen starts beeping and switches display, alerting Steven that the destination is approaching at an uncomfortable speed.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh no. That's the zoo. Uhh, we're gonna smash right into it if we don't... slow... down!}}
{{TD||(''Steven struggles to move his arm from his seat, against the ludicrous speed of the ship, to reach the control panel.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Gah! Come on, Steven. You can do it! I-it's okay! The Gems are gonna be fine! *groans* They gotta be fine! D-Dad's gonna be fine, too! Gah! I-It doesn't seem like it right now, but later, we're gonna ''laugh'' if I just stop the ship!}}
{{TD||(''Steven continues to reach his arm out to reach the control panel, but fails at the ship's ludicrous speed.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*breathing heavily* It isn't going to stop. There's no fixing this. It's all my fault! I rushed us! I pushed us into making stupid ''mistakes!'' *starts tearing up* It didn't have to be this way. I didn't have to not listen to Garnet. I didn't have to go to Korea. Dad! I didn't have to get you taken away forever by Blue Diamond. I- I wasn't trying to be selfish. I just wanted to know what was going on for myself, for ''once!'' *sobs* But now, I lost everyone... Dad! *sobbing desperately* Dad! I want my dad! I just want my dad.}}
{{TD||(''Steven, collecting determination from his moment of weakness, reaches for the control panel again and succeeds in stopping the ship. The ship jolts a bit as the Gems phase through the wall, looking disoriented.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*panting and gasps* You're back! Where'd you go!? *hugs the Gems* I was so worried!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*sighs* I think in your attempt to fix our bodies, you ''may'' have accidentally shut off the calibration altogether. Our light-composed forms couldn't keep up with the ship moving faster than the speed of light.}}
{{TD|Steven|So, you were just... lagging behind the ship... this whole time?}}
{{TD||(''Another imaginative projection appears above Steven, of the Gems' bodies stretched outside of the Roaming Eye.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Yeah. Don't worry about it too much. Amethyst liked it.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|I never thought I could ''stretch'' so far! Hah! I think I kind of phased through a planet. *laughs in joy, but then notices Steven's tears* Uhh... Yo, Stevie man. You heard Garnet.  We're totally fine, dude.}}
{{TD|Steven|I-I was pushing so hard, I... I just wanted to get Dad back so much, I-I almost wrecked the mission! This whole thing is my fault...}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven. You didn't kidnap Greg. Blue Diamond did.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Woah. Do you guys see that?}}
{{TD||(''The Crystal Gems look out the windscreen, as the human zoo comes into view ahead of them.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|What you did? You got us to the zoo.}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah?}}
{{TD|Garnet|And seventy human years ahead of schedule.}}
{{TD|Steven|I'll see you really soon, Dad. ...I hope.}}
