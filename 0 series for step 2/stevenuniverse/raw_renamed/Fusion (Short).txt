{{TD||(''The episode opens with the faces of Garnet, Pearl and Amethyst, and a scribble on a chalkboard reading "The [[Crystal Gems]]", before the "Crystal" is replaced with "Classroom"'')}}
{{TD|Altogether| '''The Classroom Gems!'''-}}
{{TD||(''Garnet breaks the title card with her rocket gauntlet, as she stands before a chalkboard with "Special Lesson" written on it.'')}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]| *yelling* Hello, this is Garnet! And today, I'm gonna be teaching you about [[Fusion Gems|fusion]]!}}
{{TD||(''A lens flare shimmers from Garnet's visors, and the scene transition to Garnet, Pearl and Amethyst [[Fusion Dance|dancing]] in a dance studio.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| A fusion is made when two or more [[Gems]] combine into one, like me.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet unfuses into [[Ruby]] and [[Sapphire]], and they start dancing too.'')}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]| Fusion is very difficult to do. Gems must be in perfect sync physically, mentally, and emotionally.}}
{{TD||(''Ruby and Sapphire fuse back into Garnet, while Pearl and Amethyst fuse into [[Opal]].'')}}

{{TD||(''Opal quickly unfuses back into Pearl and Amethyst, both angry at each other.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| I'm ''great'' at collaborating!}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]| *folds arms* Yeah, right.}}
{{TD||(''Pearl and Amethyst begin fuming in anger.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| But I get along fine.}}

{{TD|[[Steven]]| *raises his hand* Yeah, but, what's the ''best'' reason to fuse?}}
{{TD||(''The screen poofs away as the Gems turn to look at Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| Hmm... That's easy. The best reason is...}}
{{TD||(''Garnet picks Pearl and Amethyst up and twirls them around, as the three of them fuse in...'')}}
{{TD|[[Alexandrite]]| *posing* Love!}}
{{TD||(''The school bell rings as the words "Class Dismissed!" are shown.'')}}
