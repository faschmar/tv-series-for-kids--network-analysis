{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Greg's Van]], Night-time]}}
{{TD||(''Steven then wakes up in reality, with tears pouring down his face. He touches his tears and is shocked to find himself crying. He looks up inside the back of Greg's van to see a TV, playing a movie of a UFO abducting a cow.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|You okay, bud? You fell asleep during the movie. I was gonna let you sleep, you looked so cute. But, then you started crying, and that was less cute.}}
{{TD||(''Steven sits up and wipes away the tears from his face.'')}}
{{TD|[[Steven]]|Haha, no, I'm fine. I dunno why I was crying. M-my dream wasn't really sad.}}
{{TD||(''Steven yawns and Greg checks his watch.'')}}

{{TD||(''Greg beings Steven back home, and they walk toward the stairs to the house.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Eh, you didn't miss much. Turns out they were abducting cows 'cause they needed milk for their cereal planet.}}
{{TD||(''Steven climbs up the stairs, abruptly stopping halfway up before turning around.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Dad, before you go, can I ask you something?}}
{{TD|Greg|Yeah, of course!}}
{{TD|Steven|Did [[Rose Quartz|Mom]] ever talk to you about... [[Pink Diamond]]?}}
{{TD|Greg|There were some things your mom didn't like to talk about. I never pressed her for details.}}
{{TD|Steven|Why not?}}
{{TD|Greg|*approaches Steven and sits down next to him on the stairs* Rose and I talked about tons of important stuff. Music, comic books, getting sand between your toes, y'know, feelings. We both made a lot of mistakes when we were young. I thought disco was coming back, she started a [[The Rebellion|war]], I think she felt like she needed to confess everything to me, but I told her, "The past is the past. All that matters to me is who you are now." And who she was, was an incredible, loving being.}}
{{TD|Steven|*hugs Greg* Night, Dad.}}
{{TD|Greg|*hugs Steven back* Night, Steven.}}

{{TD||(''Connie flips through the pages of the journal, stopping on the entry for the Palanquin.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*gasps* That's it! The... palan-quin.}}
{{TD|Connie|Actually, it's pronounced palan''keen''.}}

{{TD|[[Pearl]]|Excuse me, Amethyst, allow me. *looks at the journal entry* Uhh... well... It appears to be an illustration in some kind of journal.}}
{{TD|Steven|C'mon, you know what I mean. I had a dream where I saw this thing. Connie and I were wondering if maybe-}}
{{TD|Pearl|S-Steven, why don't you and Connie-}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]|You can't go there!}}
{{TD||(''Everyone looks at Garnet in shock.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Why not?}}

{{TD||(''Garnet is hesitant to say anything, and Steven sighs in disappointment as he closes the journal.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|I thought you were going to tell me ''everything'' from now on.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Oh, Steven... We...}}
{{TD|Steven|Does this have anything to do with Pink Diamond? I already know Mom shattered her, so what is it about this that you can't tell me?}}
{{TD||(''Pearl covers her mouth in sorrow and glances over to Garnet.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Please, you're making Pearl very upset.}}
{{TD|Steven|NO! ''I'm'' very upset!}}

{{TD|Garnet|''Steven!''}}
{{TD|Connie|I'm sorry... I- I shouldn't have brought the book.}}

{{TD||(''Steven points at Garnet and Pearl in frustration.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Connie, I need to borrow this book.}}

{{TD||(''Steven sits outside on the stairs, gazing at the Palanquin page in Buddy's journal, when Garnet comes out to talk to him.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven... D-Don't go. You have to trust me.}}
{{TD|Steven|I don't understand, Garnet. At least ''you're'' usually honest with me.}}
{{TD|Garnet|I ''really'' want to be, but if I tell you why you shouldn't go, you'll only want to go more.}}
{{TD|Steven|*shocked* What?! Well, now I ''really'' wanna go!}}
{{TD|Garnet|Th- Ugh, I shouldn't have said that. You can't go, because I can't go with you.}}

{{TD|Greg|Is everything o-}}
{{TD|Steven|There's this place I saw in a dream, and it's real. *shows Greg the journal entry* But the Gems won't tell me anything about it. It has something to do with Pink Diamond. I know you didn't want to get involved with Mom's past, but I wanna know the truth. Doesn't that matter at all?}}
{{TD|Greg|Of course it does!}} 
{{TD|Steven|Really?}}
{{TD|Greg|*holds out his hand* Let me see that.}}

{{TD|Greg|Maybe it got a paint job?}}
{{TD|[[Blue Diamond]]|*faintly* Oh, Pink. I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...}}
{{TD||(''Hearing the voice, Greg and Steven peek through the bushes to see a giant hooded figure, accompanied by another person kneeling on the ground, speaking to the dilapidated pink Palanquin.'')}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|I should've done more. [[Yellow Diamond|Yellow]] says it'll all be over soon. I wonder what you would think. This is ''your'' planet, after all. I still think it is.}} 
{{TD|Greg|Steven, do you know her?}}
{{TD||(''Steven collapses into a sitting position behind the bushes, crying profusely from his eyes.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Whoa, buddy!}}

{{TD|Blue Diamond|Bring it here.}}
{{TD||(''Blue Pearl and Greg both walk over to the hooded figure.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| *whispering* Dad, no!}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|How curious. I'm impressed by humanity's ability to survive in the wild. What a strange planet. Where else would a being as fragile as a human live, while a being as powerful as a Diamond, perish? This is where it happened, where she was... broken.}}
{{TD|Greg|Were you close?}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|Very.}}
{{TD|Greg|I-I'm awfully sorry. I know how hard it is to move on when you've lost someone.}}

{{TD|Blue Diamond|You do?}}
{{TD||(''A tear drop drips out of Blue Diamond's eye, which affects Steven as well, as tear flows from his eye too.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|I lost someone very important to me, too. I miss her every single day, and I think about her all the time. But she's never coming back. That feeling can be so hard to be okay with.}} 
{{TD|Blue Diamond|I'm surprised that a human being is capable of understanding how I feel. It's a shame. There's a [[The Cluster|geo-weapon]] incubating in [[Earth|your planet]] that will destroy everything shortly. But you don't deserve that, do you?}}
{{TD|Greg|Geo-weapon, huh?}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|*inches towards Greg* You know, I really shouldn't be here. But I'm glad I came back one ''last'' time. I can save one last piece of her legacy.}} 
{{TD|Greg|Oh yeah?}}
{{TD||(''Blue Diamond suddenly grabs Greg, keeping him within the grasp of her hand.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*whisper-yells*Dad!}}

{{TD|Steven|Dad, Dad!}}
{{TD||(''Steven runs out of the bushes after the Palanquin, as it ascends into the palm of the hand ship, gripping onto the Palanquin.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|STOP!}}
{{TD||(''Steven jumps from the ground, floating high into the sky after the hand ship. The ship starts turning around to face up into space. Steven is about to reach the ship, when it warps into faster-than-light travel, disappearing instantly. The force from the warp forces Steven back towards the ground.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Dad...}}
{{TD||(''Steven continues to fall, when Garnet suddenly leaps in and catches him in midair. She lands back on the ground and embraces Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven, I'm s- I'm sorry!}}
{{TD|Steven|Garnet!}}
{{TD|Garnet|I saw you come here, I saw Blue Diamond on Earth, I saw her see me and find all of us, I couldn't be here with you!}}
{{TD|Steven|She took my dad! It's all my fault! I should've listened to you! What are we gonna do, Garnet?}}
{{TD|Garnet|We're going to space. We're going to get him back.}}
