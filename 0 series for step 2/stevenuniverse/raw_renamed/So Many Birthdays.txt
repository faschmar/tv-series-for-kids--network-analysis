{{TD||[Open Int. [[Amethyst's Room]]]}}
{{TD||(''[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] and the [[Crystal Gems|Gems]] are walking through the piles of random junk in Amethyst's room, in search of an object causing the foul odor throughout the [[Crystal Temple|temple]].'')}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]|*to Amethyst* How can you ''live'' like this?}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]|It was fine 'til you guys started whining.}}
{{TD|Pearl|*covers her nose* ''Whining?!'' The whole temple reeks!}}
{{TD||(''Steven probes some garbage with a stick and retrieves something wrapped in tinfoil.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|I found it!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*pinches nose* What matter of magical alloy is ''this?''}} 
{{TD||(''Steven unwraps the tinfoil, and a puff of green gas plumes out.'')}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]|It's a burrito.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*takes the visibly rotten burrito* It's the Tuna Burrito from [[Aqua-Mexican]]!}}
{{TD|Steven|That place closed like five years ago! (''Amethyst takes a bite of the burrito, Steven flinches in disgust and Pearl looks on in horror.'') Huh, what's this? *spots a [[Minor_Objects/Miscellaneous#Old_Gem_Painting|painting]] of the Gems and [[Rose Quartz]] on it* It kinda looks like you guys and my mom.}}
{{TD|Pearl|*excitedly* Oh Steven, that ''is'' us.}}
{{TD|Steven|Really?}}
{{TD|Garnet|The hard part was getting the shark to pose.}}
{{TD|Steven|Why is everyone dressed like old timey people?}}
{{TD|Pearl|*places the painting on top of a junk pile* They ''are'' old timey people.}}
{{TD|Steven|Wait... But that would mean... how OLD are you guys?}}
{{TD|Pearl|''Much'' older than any human.}}
{{TD|Steven|Does that mean you'll live forever?!}}
{{TD|Pearl|No, no. We don't age. (''Steven makes a huge smile.'') But we can still get hurt and die.}}
{{TD||(''Steven's smile quickly turns into a big frown. Amethyst then starts moaning in pain, visibly sickened, and keels onto the ground.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|...But not from food poisoning.}}
{{TD|Steven|I just can't believe you guys are like a bazillion years old! How do you find a cake big enough for all those candles?}}
{{TD|Garnet|*briefly looks at Pearl* We don't really celebrate birthdays.}}
{{TD|Steven|*gasps loudly* Why not?!}}
{{TD|Garnet|*shrugs* It's not our way.}}
{{TD|Steven|Well I can't just ignore this tremesty <sup>[''sic'']</sup> of unjustice. I pledge that you will have your birthdays, with all the candy, cake, and ice cream you've been denied.}} 
{{TD||(''The screen goes black as Amethyst throws up.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[Crystal Temple]]]}}
{{TD||(''Outside, several birthday decorations are set up: a picnic mat with food items, a birthday cake with lots of candles, balloons, and a large "birthday throne". Amethyst sits on the throne wearing a cape, while Peal and Garnet sit on folding chairs. [[Lion]] is seen playing in the background.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*crowning Amethyst* And the birthday queen is, Amethyst! I hope you like it, [[Greg Universe|Dad]] made me [[Steven's Birthday Suit|this outfit]] and it brings me special birthday luck every year. *begins to sing* ♫ It might as well be your birthday, so why don't we have a party? Even if your age isn't real and your body's an illusion. ♫ *notices Lion playing with a birthday hat, stops singing* Hey!, I-it goes like this. *puts the hat on Lion's head, and Lion tries to take it off* Lion, you're killing me.}}
{{TD|Pearl|*holding a balloon with a face drawn on it* Um, Steven? I know you put a lot of effort into... putting faces on things. But could it be that we're just a tad ''mature'' for this ritual?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*using a birthday hat to simulate Pearl's nose, and pokes Pearl's nose with it* Boop.}}
{{TD|Pearl|GAH! *chases Amethyst* You will remove that this instant!}}
{{TD|Steven|Wait! Here. *offers Amethyst a bat with a ribbon on it*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Awww, thanks! *takes the bat* I'll use it all the time! *attempts to hit Pearl with it*}}
{{TD|Steven|*immediately stops her* No! It's for the piñata. *holding the piñata, as a blindfolded Amethyst swings wildly at it* The piñata is an artifact from ancient Aqua-Mexico. (''Amethyst almost hit Steven, scaring him.'') A-a-aaaaah! *hands the piñata to Garnet and hides behind her*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*swings and smacks Garnet repeatedly* Am I... getting... close?! *hits Garnet in the head*}}
{{TD|Garnet|Higher.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst takes a peeks, jumps at the piñata and smacks it flying out and into the ocean.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*casts the bat aside* Ha, what next Steven?}}
{{TD|Steven|Well, you were supposed to get delicious candy when you broke it open.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*gasps in sadness* Wait, you had candy and you didn't just give it to us?}}
{{TD|Steven|There will be more sweet treats at Pearl's party. I promise.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Cliff facing Beach City]}}
{{TD||(''Steven brings them to a cliff overlooking [[Beach City]]. The Gems are sitting on a picnic mat, with Pearl now wearing the birthday outfit. Steven is dressed like a clown.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Happy Birthday! HONK. *honks his clown nose*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Steven! That is a ''brave'' look.}}
{{TD|Steven|No, it's funny.}}
{{TD|Pearl|''How?''}}
{{TD|Steven|*tries to explain but stops* Oh geez, I'm breaking character. Wait wait wait. I wrote some jokes! *takes out a pile of papers* "Why did Pearl throw butter out the window?"}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*looks at a confused Pearl* You did ''what?''}}
{{TD|Steven|To see a butter-''fly!''}}
{{TD|Pearl|I never did that. Steven, are you telling ''lies?''}}
{{TD|Steven|N-no! Oh, I know! Pearl, do you like pie?}}
{{TD|Pearl| I DO like pie.}}
{{TD|Steven|*gets a pie out of a picnic basket* Well then you're in luck, I baked you a pie. *mickingly* I sure hope nothing happens to it!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Yes, me too.}}
{{TD|Steven|*intentionally trips* WOAH! Whoops!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*catches Steven* WOAH! Steven, I've got you. *stands him up* Be careful, you almost fell right on that- (''Steven shoves the pie in his own face.'') Ah!}}
{{TD|Steven|*face covered in pie cream* See, Pearl? It's funnnnnnnnny! *laughs* (''Pearl hides nervously behind Garnet and whispers to her.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Pearl says she's all partied out and she's ready to go home.}}
{{TD|Steven|This isn't going at all like it should. *tosses aside the pie tin and takes off his wig * I've got to pull out the ultimate birthday!}}
{{TD||[Trans. empty lot near [[Big Donut]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven brings the Gems to an empty lot. Garnet is wearing the birthday outfit now.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Okay, there's no way you're not gonna ''love'' this! *points to three small kiddie cars* It's kazoo racers! You get in a car, you play a kazoo, what more could you want?! *blows into a kazoo and holds up three more kazoos* Dad used to do this for me ''every'' year.}}
{{TD|Pearl|*whispers to Garnet anxiously* I think this is why aging makes humans ''die!''}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven, thank you for the birthday parties, but I don't think we'll need any more.}}
{{TD|Steven|Why not?}}
{{TD|Garnet|Our age is only an illusion. *takes off the birthday crown* And Pearl's pretty sure this ritual is more for human children.}}
{{TD|Pearl|*remorsefully* Nothing against ''children''.}}
{{TD|Steven|Children? Everyone gets to have birthdays, seriously, give it a try. You're never too old.}}
{{TD|Garnet|We're just too ''big''.}}
{{TD|Steven|You're not too big. Y-y-you just get in. *attempts to get into one of the kiddie cars* And then, uh...}}
{{TD|Amethyst|''I'' can fit! *shapeshifts into a baby and sits in a small kiddie jeep* Which way to the baby war? *drives the jeep* EAT TREAD, DIRT BAGS!}}
{{TD|Steven|What if birthdays are just for little kids? What if even... ''I'm'' too old?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*drives next to Steven* No way! You TOTALLY fit! *picks him up and attempts to shove him in* Oh, my bad, you ''are'' too old. *drives off and laughs*}}
{{TD|Pearl|Are you okay?}}
{{TD|Steven|I just need to think. *gets up with the car stuck to his behind* Kazoo Racers suddenly seems undignified. *walks off*}}
{{TD||[Trans. Time Skip - Evening, Beach City Boardwalk]}}
{{TD||(''The sun is down and the place is turning dark. Steven walks alone on the boardwalk as a mist rolls in.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|I never realized birthdays meant leaving things behind. All these parties, ugh, so embarrassing.}}
{{TD||(''As the mist envelops Steven, his [[Gemstones|gem]] starts to glow, causing him to mature into a teenager, with facial face and pimples. He sighs in a cracking voice, when he sees Onion at the [[Funland Arcade]].'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh [[Onion]], so young, so innocent. (''Steven turns around, as Onion pry open a game machine and steals the quarters from it.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Funland Arcade]}}
{{TD|Steven|*walks into the arcade* [[Whacker Man Jr.]]! *looks around nervously* Ooh, I can't be seen playing a childish game like Whacker Man Jr. I better stick to sophisticated games, like regular [[Whacker Man]]. *starts playing it*}}
{{TD|Whacker Man|It's whackin' time. You're gonna get whacked! (''Steven bops a figure with a mallet and chuckles nervously.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Beach City Boardwalk]}}
{{TD|Steven|*walking on the boardwalk again* That was fun, but a boy on the cusp of manhood can't spend the whole day whackering. I need to take control of my life. (''Steven sees a "Help Wanted" sign on the [[Minor Locations#T-Shirt Shop|T-Shirt Shop]]'s window. His gem glows and ages him into a full-grown man, deepening his voice and his current clothes visibly too small for him now.'') It's time, to get a proper job. *enters the store and looks at the shirts* But which one? Surf Master? No. Love Doctor? I'm too squeamish. Ah, now ''this'' is the job for me. *leaves the store wearing a red shirt that reads "Professional Beach Hunk"* Ha, this day went so fast, I need a pick-me-up. *walks towards the [[Big Donut]], as his gem glows*}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Big Donut]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven enters the Big Donut as a middle-aged man with balding hair.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Two of the usual please, I've had quite a day.}}
{{TD|[[Lars]]|Ha, you must be confused pal, I work here everyday and I've never seen ''your'' mug before.}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh hardy har, Lars. (''Lars and [[Sadie]] get startled and look at each other in confusion.'') I used to make jokes, but you know what? I've had a lot of time to think today and sometimes you gotta smarten up, act like an adult. Because one day, if you don't, everyone you know is gonna grow up without you. And then you won't have little Steven to pick on anymore because I'll be a grown up too.}}
{{TD|Sadie|... Steven... who?}}
{{TD|Steven|*shocked* '''''STEVEN QUARTZ UNIVERSE!''''' And I want ''THAT'' doughnut, ''right there!'' *points at the doughnut case and sees a reflection of himself in the glass* Woa-wooaaahhhh!}}
{{TD|Sadie|Sir, are you okay?}}
{{TD|Steven|'''''I'M... OLD!'''''}}
{{TD|Lars|Yeah, and nuts!}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm going to have to eat fiber cereal, all my teeth are gonna fall out, and then, I'll have to eat oatmeal and it'll be sugar-free! (''His gem glows and ages him further.'') Sugar-free! *wheezes* *sits down at a table, and Sadie comes over to comfort him* I need to reverse this! I need, a "reverse birthday"... The king costume. *to Sadie and Lars* Will you help me into my birthday suit?}}
{{TD||(''Sadie and Lars are stunned. Taking it the wrong way, Sadie chases the old Steven out of the Big Donut with a stool.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie|*waving the stool above her head* Yeah! You ''better'' run!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Beach]}}
{{TD||(''Steven continues to run along the beach, but hurts his back doing so.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*limping* I'm... too... old... for this. (''His gem glows, aging him into a very old man with a gray beard, and he trips over. Lion then approaches him.'') Lion... (''Lion picks Steven up with his mouth and runs towards the temple.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Crystal Temple]}}
{{TD||(''The Gems are picking up the birthday decorations.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|*putting away a table* You know, Steven was right, this ''is'' fun.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|You don't have to keep wearing that stuff.}}
{{TD|Garnet|*still wearing the birthday outfit* It makes me feel... important.}}
{{TD||(''Lion comes in and drops the aged Steven in front of the Gems. Garnet and Amethyst rush towards him.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven! *horrified* What's wrong with him?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|He's okay, he's just really, really, really, really old.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Gems can't die from aging. *starts tearing up* But he's half human.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Can't we fix him?}}
{{TD|Steven|*whispering* My birthday suit might help.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet takes the birthday suit off her and Steven wears it, leaning against Lion.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Good as new!... Right?}}
{{TD|Steven|Thanks guys, but I guess this suit's all out of birthday magic. We had a good run, huh?...}} 
{{TD||(''Steven continues to age further. Amethyst looks on in horror and Pearl is about to cry. Garnet grabs  and pulls Pearl and Amethyst away.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|More birthdays. Now!*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Check it out, B-Day Boy.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst has shapeshifted into a kiddie car, with Garnet riding in her.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|I'm a tiny car!}}
{{TD|Garnet|Beep beep.}}
{{TD|Steven|Kid... stuff..... (''Steven keeps aging, and Amethyst shiftshapes back to normal.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*shapeshifts into a piñata* Ooh, piñata time! (''Steven keeps aging.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|It's not working.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*back to normal, walks off* Pearl! Get over here.}}
{{TD|Pearl|I can't!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|FOR ''STEVEN!'' *plants Pearl, wearing a clown costume and holding a pie, in front of Steven*}}
{{TD|Pearl|*approaches Steven, weeping* Oh, look!... I have what umm... what appears to be a delicious pie... I sincerely hope that... nothing happens to- '''''OH STEVEN!''''' *breaks down and shoves the pie in her face*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Are you trying to kill him ''faster?!'' (''Pearl starts crying and clings tightly to Amethyst.'') Pearl! *tries to break free*}}
{{TD||(''Garnet shoves them aside and walks towards Steven. She picks him up and starts shaking him violently.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst & Pearl|'''''GARNET?!?!''''' *rush over to stop Garnet*}}
{{TD|Pearl|Wait a minute, what are you doing?!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Garnet, ''STOP!!''}}
{{TD|Garnet|I thought... violence... would be the answer. *slowly puts down Steven, who is still aging*}}
{{TD||(''The severely-aged Steven can only barely see and hear the Gems arguing in despair with one another. He slowly picks himself up.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*weakly* Would you guys, just please... (''His gem glows again, turning him back into an adult.'') ''Control'' yourselves?! (''The Gems stop fighting and looks at Steven.'') Ugh, oh no. *turns into a teenager and blushes* Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have yelled. But I can't stand to see you freaking out like this! *turns back into an adult*}}
{{TD|Pearl|*in shock* Wha-?}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven, you're changing!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Your age is fluctuating, I think your gem is reacting to your state of mind.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Steven! ''Stop feeling old!''}}
{{TD|Steven|*turns into a teenager* But I wasted your time... *turns into an old man* We all have such little ti-ime... }}
{{TD|Garnet, Pearl & Amethyst|Steven!}}
{{TD|Pearl|You have to feel like your self! Sweet and considerate and only occasionally obnoxious!}}
{{TD|Steven|*turns into a teenager* You really think I'm all those things?}}
{{TD|Garnet|Yes!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Why else would you throw us all those parties?}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh my gosh, you're right. *turns back to normal* I ''am'' pretty great.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Oh, Steven! *rushes with Amethyst to hug Steven* Steven!}}
{{TD|Garnet|*pats Steven on his shoulder* We'll work on the rest, later.}}
{{TD||(''Steven pulls up his now-oversized shirt to reveal that he still has adult legs. He starts laughing and bouncing his legs up and down, as the star iris zooms in on Steven's face, ending the episode.'')}}
