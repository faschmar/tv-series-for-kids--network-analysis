{{TD||(''A title card of static image of Snack Sushi is shown, as it cuts to [[Lion]] in the kitchen, wearing a bowtie.'')}}
{{TD|Steven (Lion)|I am Lion, the host of the show, ''"Cooking with Lion"''.}}
{{TD||(''Lion yawns loudly as Steven introduces him in the manner of a cooking show.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Hi, everyone. Today, we're going to make "Snack Sushi". This is a great dish to make if you're going to have friends over who don't like the taste of raw fish.}}
{{TD||(''Lion knocks an avocado off the table as Steven speaks.'')}}
{{TD|Steven (Lion)|Or if somebody has already eaten all of your tuna.}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, Lion. That- *chuckles briefly* That was a lot of tuna. And then you just threw it up into my shoes. But I've found a surprise replacement ingredient, so let's get started.}}
{{TD|Steven (Lion)|First, use the spoon to cut slices into the flesh of the avocado, then run the spoon along the inside of the skin and transfer the slices to a plate.}}
{{TD||(''Steven spreads the slices of avocado on a plate.'')}}
{{TD|Steven (Lion)|Next, let's make the spicy mayo! In a bowl, combine mayonnaise and your favorite hot sauce to taste. I like it very spicy.}}
{{TD||(''Steven mixes the mayonnaise and spicy sauce together into a paste, all while Lion makes a derpy expression.'')}}
{{TD|Steven (Lion)|Let's prepare the sushi roll! On a bamboo rolling mat, place a sheet of seaweed paper rough side up. Using a rice paddle or spatula, spread the sushi rice onto the seaweed paper.}}
{{TD|Steven|Click here for the "how to make Sushi Rice" video!}}
{{TD||(''Steven points upwards with his paddle at a button above him reading "click!".'')}}
{{TD|Steven (Lion)|Line up your avocado slices on top of the sushi rice. Now for the secret ingredient. Cheese puffs!}}
{{TD|Steven|Make sure to use the smoother variety of puff for the proper texture.}}
{{TD||(''Steven takes a cheese puff out of a bag and Lions chomps onto it.'')}}
{{TD|Steven (Lion)|Line up your puffs along the avocado slices, then use the bamboo mat to roll up your sushi roll. Now, carefully slice your roll into six equally sized pieces.}}
{{TD||(''As Steven slices the sushi roll, Lion is seen licking himself with his leg high up in the air.'')}}
{{TD|Steven (Lion)|To finish, place a dollop of the spicy mayo on top of each piece of sushi, and garnish the plate with another dollop 'cause it's fancy.}}
{{TD|Steven|Time to try one myself!}}
{{TD||(''Steven is about to eat a piece of sushi, when Lion shoves him away.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Lion! No! At least save the flavors!}}
{{TD||(''Lion devours all of the sushi, before walking off.'')}}
{{TD|Steven (Lion)|The [[Cooking with Lion#Ingredients|ingredients]] in this Snack Sushi are delicious. Be sure to serve fresh for a maximum crunch.}}
{{TD||(''The video ends as Steven's other recipes are promoted, such as the [[Together Breakfast (food)|Together Breakfast]] and the [[Minor Objects/Food#Dog-Nut|Dog-Nuts]]. Another ending card promotes a recipe for [[Cookie Cat]] coming soon, along with the caption "Please subscribe".'')}}
