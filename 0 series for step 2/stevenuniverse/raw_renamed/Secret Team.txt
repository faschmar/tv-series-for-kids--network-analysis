{{TD||[Open Int. [[Amethyst's Room]]]}}
{{TD||(''[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] and [[Amethyst]] are hanging out inside her room of the [[Crystal Temple]]. Steven climbs a junk pile beside a puddle and steps on a [[Minor_Objects/Toys#Bass_Fish_Toy|Bass Fish Toy]], causing it to sing "[[Fishing for Compliments]]".)}}
{{TD|Steven |*giggles* Cannonball! *plunges into the puddle* Amethyst, did you see? I think that was my best one!}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Eh. You need to put more "ball" in your "cannon".}}
{{TD|Steven |*looks down* Is that gonna hurt?}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Not if you do it like... this! *shapeshifts into a ball and jumps into the puddle, causing a huge splash*}}
{{TD|Steven |*climbs back to dry ground, laughing* That was awesome! I want to jump in some more puddles.}}
{{TD|Amethyst |*emerges from the water* Okay. *points to different puddles* You can try this one... or that one.}}
{{TD|Steven |*sees a small puddle next to him* What about this one?}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Whoa, Steven! Wait!}}
{{TD||(''Steven dunks his head into the puddle and find himself in [[The Burning Room]]. He then sees Garnet passes by as she places a bubbled [[Gemstones|gem]] in the room. Amethyst then dunks her hand in and pulls Steven's head out of the puddle.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst |*speaks nervously* Only Garnet is allowed in there! Let's do something less dangerous. *looks around* Why don't you jump off that? *points to a towering junk pile*}}
{{TD|Steven |Whoa. How do you even stack your stuff that high?}}
{{TD|Amethyst |It's a talent.}}
{{TD||(''Steven grunts as he proceeds to climb towards the top of the junk pile. He then looks down from atop, seeing Amethyst standing next to a puddle, both looking really small from the sheer height.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Do it!}}
{{TD|Steven |Amethyst, I hope you're ready! 'Cause here I... Goooo— *jumps off the pile, and hits a tire along the way* Unh! Aaaaah!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Pearl's Room]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven manages to plunge into the puddle and emerges on the other side, on what seems to be one of the various waterfalls in Pearl's room.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |*gasps* Huh? Am I in Pearl's room?}}
{{TD|Amethyst |*pops up next to Steven in the water* Ha! that was crazy! Huh? *sees Pearl dancing with a pink bubble full of [[Gem Shards]]* What is she doing with a [[Rose Quartz]] bubble?}}
{{TD|Steven |My mom bubbled that?}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Garnet's gonna be so maaa—}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst sinks her mouth underwater and begins moving towards Pearl. Steven chuckles and follows suit.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl |*inspecting Rose Quartz bubble* Ah. Hmm. hmm? Mm-hmm. Mm...}}
{{TD|Amethyst |*sneaks up behind Pearl* Busted!}}
{{TD|Pearl |*startled* What are you doing in here?!}}
{{TD|Amethyst |*mockingly* What are you doing in here?!}}
{{TD|Pearl |*blushes* I... just wanted to see how the shards are reacting to Rose's bubble. And it's none of your business.}}
{{TD|Amethyst |I think it's ''Garnet's'' business.}}
{{TD|Steven |Oooooohhhh!}}
{{TD|Pearl |*grabs Amethyst's by her shirt nervously* Don't tell her!}}
{{TD|Amethyst |How are you gonna stop me? *pulls Pearl's hand away*}}
{{TD||(''Pearl kicks Amethyst in the face, and she bites Pearl's foot in retaliation.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl |Aggh! Ame-thyst!}}
{{TD|Steven |*runs in between Pearl and Amethyst* Guys, stop fighting!}}
{{TD|Pearl |*looks away* Heathen ("''Steven''")! (''Amethyst hisses at Pearl.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |*takes the Rose Quartz bubble from Pearl* Here. Let's just put it back...}}
{{TD|Pearl |Steven, be careful with that!}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Yeah, give it to me!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl and Amethyst reach for the bubble at the same time and accidentally pop it together. Everyone gasps as they stare at the now-unbubbled shards on Steven's hands. The shards then glow and reform into several disembodied limbs. Steven screams as the limbs crawl away, scattering throughout the temple via the waterfalls in Pearl's room.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |*whispers* We gotta get Garnet.}}
{{TD|Amethyst |No! No way! We just freed a bunch of mindless Gem chunks, okay?! They're going to crawl who knows where, all over the temple. And when Garnet finds out, we're dead!}}
{{TD|Pearl |*hyperventilates for a moment, before calming down slightly* She's not going to find out... We're going to catch them. All of them.}}
{{TD|Amethyst |You're right. Every single one, back in a bubble and back in the basement!}}
{{TD|Pearl |Like nothing ever happened.}}
{{TD|Steven |And then we tell Garnet?}}
{{TD|Pearl & Amethyst |No!}}
{{TD|Pearl |*places her hand on Steven's shoulder* This has to stay a secret, okay?}}
{{TD|Steven |Our secret... together? *gasps* If we've got a secret, we've got to do this right, which means we got to come up with a name for our secret-keeping team. Something cool, like... the "Secret Team"!}}
{{TD|Pearl |Uh... *exchanges glances with Amethyst* }}
{{TD|Steven |And a Secret Team needs membership cards that we can show off to other people! *pulls two coupons out of his pocket* Here! *hands them to Pearl and Amethyst*}}
{{TD|Pearl |*reads her coupon* [[Fish Stew Pizza]]?}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Eh, what's a "VIP(IZZA)"?}}
{{TD|Steven |Well, if you collect enough of them, you can get a free pizza. But now, they're the official card of... the ''Secret Team''!}}
{{TD|Pearl |... Greeaat, Steven. Come on. We're doing this.}}
{{TD|Amethyst |*nods* Hm!}}
{{TD|Steven |Secret Team, move out!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Crystal Temple]}}
{{TD||(''Steven, Pearl and Amethyst begin rounding up the gem shards all through the temple as "[[Secret_Team_(soundtrack)|Secret Team]]" plays in the background. The Secret Team logo occasionally flashes in between followed by a whisper of "Secret Team". They make their way through Amethyst's room, the room with floating platform and the [[Crystal Heart]], poofing and collecting gem shards as they go. During the hunt, Pearl and Amethyst seem to be getting along positively, which pleases Steven.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Pearl's Room]}}
{{TD||(''The Secret Team returns back atop a waterfall in Pearl's room, totaling the gem shards they have on each hand.}}
{{TD|Pearl |Okay.}}
{{TD|Amethyst |That looks like all of them.}}
{{TD|Steven |Yeah! Secret Team!}}
{{TD|Pearl |Hmm... Are you sure we didn't miss any?}}
{{TD|Amethyst |No way! We totally nailed this.}}
{{TD|Steven |Yeah!}}
{{TD|Pearl |*clears throat* If you're sure this is all of them, then we just need to seal it in a Rose Quartz bubble.}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Steven, this is all you! Think you can handle it? *hands her shards to Steven*}}
{{TD|Steven |Yeah. I can do it.}}
{{TD|Pearl |Of course you can! You're part of the Secret Club!}}
{{TD|Steven |Secret ''Team''.}}
{{TD|Pearl |Ah, yes. Secret Team. *hands Steven her shards too*}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Yeah, that thing.}}
{{TD||(''Steven proceeds to bubble all the shards together.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Burning Room]}}
{{TD||(''Steven dunks his head in the puddle in Amethyst's room again, preparing to put the bubbled shards back in the Burning Room, when he sees Garnet in the room. He gasps as Garnet turns her head slightly towards him.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Amethyst's room]}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst and Pearl are holding Steven by his legs, when he starts flailing around, and they pull him out of the puddle.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |*gasps* G-Garnet!}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Did she see you?}}
{{TD|Steven |I don't think so.}}
{{TD|Pearl |Then what are you waiting for?}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst and Pearl dunks Steven back in the puddle. With Garnet still in the room, Steven quietly places the bubbled shards in the room and exits the puddle.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl |Mission accomplished. Congratulations, us.}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Aww, yes. We're off the hook.}}
{{TD|Steven |All right! So, what's next?}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Nothing "next". The mission is over.}}
{{TD|Pearl |Now everything goes back to normal and we never speak of this again.}}
{{TD|Steven |But what about... Secret Team?}}
{{TD||[Trans. [[Beach City]] Boardwalk]}}
{{TD||(''Steven walks along the boardwalk wearing a fedora, casting a shadow over his face, and walks up to [[Beach Citywalk Fries]].'')}}
{{TD|[[Mr. Fryman]]| Hey, Steven! What'll it be?}}
{{TD|Steven |Give me... the bits.}}
{{TD||(''Mr. Fryman leaves to get some fry bits, as Steven retrieves a dollar bill and the VIP(IZZA) coupon from his pocket. He looks at the coupon in dismay.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |We were the best, Fryman.}}
{{TD|Mr. Fryman |*places a bag of bits on the counter* Who was the best?}}
{{TD|Steven |*slams his fist on counter dramatically* I can't tell you! *sighs* How come the best things in life are things you can't tell other people because you'd get in big trouble?}}
{{TD|Mr. Fryman |Steven, are you in a gang?}}
{{TD|Steven |Not these days. But maybe I can be again. *chugs down all the bits in one go, slams the bag on the counter and walks off*}}
{{TD|Mr. Fryman |That kid keeps getting weirder.}}
{{TD|[[Ronaldo]]|*suddenly appears behind the counter, wearing a similar fedora, and waves at Steven* I like your hat!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Pearl's room]}}
{{TD||(''Steven gathers Pearl and Amethyst back atop the waterfall in Pearl's room.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |I know you must be wondering why I brought you all here. It's 'cause I'm gettin' the team back together! So, here's the gig. *pulls a photo out of pocket and hands to Pearl* I left my special hat at the Big Donut.}}
{{TD|Pearl |I've never seen you wear this.}}
{{TD|Steven |But now it's closed for the day. So the mission is, we break in and get it back. And, bam! The Secret Team is back on top!}}
{{TD|Amethyst |*sweating* Steven, Secret Team is over.}}
{{TD|Pearl |Secret Team? What's that?! *chuckles nervously*}}
{{TD|Steven |Aw, come on! We had so much fun together! Getting along, sneaking around—}}
{{TD|Pearl |*grabs Steven by the shoulders* Steven! That was not about fun. *crosses her arms* That was about fixing our terrible mistake.}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Eh, your terrible mistake. You shouldn't have had that bubble in the first place.}}
{{TD|Pearl |It never would have popped if you hadn't invaded my personal space!}}
{{TD|Steven |Aw, come on. Team, team!}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Fine, you can have all the personal space you want, 'cause I never want to be on a team with you again!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst pulls out her VIP(IZZA) coupon and rips it in half. Steven gasps in horror as she drops it on the ground.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl |Good! I don't want to be on a team with you, either! *rips her VIP(IZZA) coupon too*}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Fine!}}
{{TD|Pearl |Fine! *grits her teeth*}}
{{TD|Steven |Guys, come on!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl and Amethyst leave in separate directions, leaving a dismayed Steven behind.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Fish Stew Pizza]}}
{{TD||(''Steven sits alone in the pizza restaurant, when the doorbell jingles and Garnet enters.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet |*sits across Steven* I'm here.}}
{{TD|Steven |I have something I want to tell you. *pulls out a VIP(IZZA) coupon and slides it to Garnet*}}
{{TD|Garnet |Pizza.}}
{{TD|Steven |No! I... need to come clean. Pearl and Amethyst popped a bubble. We made a Secret Team to cover it up 'cause they didn't want you to know.}}
{{TD|Garnet |And now you're trying to do the right thing.}}
{{TD|Steven |Not really... I just want Secret Team again.}}
{{TD|Garnet |I see, I know how to handle things with them. We'll have to form our own Secret Team to do it.}}
{{TD|Steven |*gasps* You mean like... a Super Secret Team?}}
{{TD|Garnet |Pizza Daughter! (''[[Kiki]] walks over.'') I'll take one "pizza posse" card.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Pearl's room]}}
{{TD||(''Pearl is training with her spear in her room atop a waterfall, when Garnet leaps in, carrying Steven and Amethyst.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl |*gasps* Garnet! *dispels her spear*}}
{{TD||(''Garnet drops Steven and Amethyst in front of Pearl.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst |What's the deal?}}
{{TD|Pearl |*runs to Steven's side* Steven!}}
{{TD|Steven |What's this all about, Garnet?}}
{{TD|Garnet |I know all about the Gem shards!}}
{{TD|Pearl |Uh... *exchanges glances with Amethyst*}}
{{TD|Steven |*getss up* I—It was me! I'm the one who popped the bubble! All by myself.}}
{{TD|Pearl |Steven... *stands up* I can't believe you...!}}
{{TD|Garnet |*sighs and crosses her arms behind her back* If no one has anything else to say, and everyone else is innocent... Steven, I'm going to have to punish you.}}
{{TD|Steven | No! Not punishment! *sighs dramatically*}}
{{TD|Garnet |Come with me, Steven-}}
{{TD||(''A giant black hand suddenly emerges out of the water and shove Garnet underwater. Steven, Pearl and Amethyst watch in shock, and the black hand reappears at another waterfall, holding Garnet in its fist.)}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Garnet!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst and Pearl summon their weapons and charge at the black hand, which quickly retreats underwater.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |Oh, no! We must have missed a shard!}}
{{TD||(''The black hand keeps popping in and out from various waterfall. Amethyst, caught off-guard, gets punched by the black hand, flinging her onto another waterfall. The black hand then engages Pearl in combat. Amethyst tries to rush back towards the hand, but another one emerges out of the water and stops heron her track.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |*gasps* Amethyst!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst gets disarmed and tries to dodge the attacks from the second black hand. She quickly resummons her whip and wraps it around the middle finger of the hand. The hand then reels Amethyst towards it and grips her tightly, lifting her high above Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl |Aahhhh!}}
{{TD|Steven |Pearl! *runs towards her*}}
{{TD||(''The first black hand grabs Pearl too, lifting her beside Amethyst. Amethyst and Pearl struggle and grunt in pain as the hands squeeze them tightly.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl |Amethyst, shapeshift! Get small or... something!}}
{{TD|Amethyst |I can't! I'm freaking out! You do it!}}
{{TD|Pearl |I can't concentra- Aah! *gets flailed by the hand and clamped down again* Unh! This is all my fault! I never should have had that bubble!}}
{{TD|Amethyst |It wouldn't have popped if it wasn't for me!}}
{{TD|Steven |We should've told Garnet! We should've told her right away! I knew Secret Team was wrong! I just— I wanted to see you guys acting like friends! *starts weeping*}}
{{TD||(''Garnet then emerges out of the water in front of Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |*gasps* Garnet?}}
{{TD||(''The black hands release Amethyst and Pearl. Garnet begin to shapeshift her arms back to normal, revealing that the black hands are hers all along.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl |What?}}
{{TD|Amethyst |Huh?}}
{{TD|Garnet |So, you two can't get along unless you think I'm going to kill you. (''Pearl and Amethyst are dumbfounded, and Garnet crouches down before Steven.'') Steven, I know you wanted to help them. You wanted to protect them, even from me. They made you feel like you had to take their side. But there are no sides, because we're all on the same team...The [[Crystal Gems]]! *rips her VIP(IZZA) coupon in half and drops it*}}
{{TD||(''Steven pulls out his VIP(IZZA) coupon and rips it too. Amethyst and Pearl reveal their torn coupons from earlier in their hands and drop them alongside the other torn coupons.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |You know what? Between the four of us... We could've had a free pizza.}}
{{TD||(''The star iris zooms in on the torn VIP(IZZA) coupons floating on the water, ending the episode.'')}}
