{{TD||''([[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]], still glowing pink, warps into his greenhouse and walks into [[Steven's Room|his room.]] Steven's phone rings, receiving a call from [[Connie Maheswaran|Connie]].)''}}
{{TD|Steven|...Hey, Connie, what's up?}}
{{TD|Connie|Steven! Good, you finally picked up! I can't believe we haven't spoken since the [[hospital]]. How are you?}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm great! Never been better!}}
{{TD|Connie|Really? Have you had any more issues with swelling and glowing pink?}}
{{TD|Steven|Um... Nope? Well, maybe, but how about ''you?'' How's college prep?}}
{{TD|Connie|Steven, that's, uh- It's fine, but what do you mean, maybe?}}
{{TD|Steven|Look, there's nothing to worry about. I'm okay.}}
{{TD|Connie|Steven...}}
{{TD|Steven|I should go. I don't wanna wake up the [[Crystal Gems|Gems]].}}
{{TD|Connie|But they don't even ''sleep!''}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh, bye!}}
{{TD||''(Steven groans as he ends the call. He looks down at his flip flop-less foot and holds his hands out in front of him. He grabs his head and his television turns on.)''}}
{{TD|Steven (TV)|*in "[[Mr. Universe (episode)|Mr. Universe]]"* -is I'm a UNIVERSE-}}
{{TD||''(His television cuts to static, turning on again shortly after. The shattered shards of [[Jasper]] are shown from their reveal in "[[Fragments]]". His television cuts to static again. In "[[Homeworld Bound]]", [[White Diamond]] is shown from Steven's nightmare vision about to shatter herself. Steven gets up and turns the television off, gasping as he sees his diamond-shaped irises in the television's reflection.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|No! No-n-n-n-no! Th-Th-This isn't ''happening...!'' I didn't think about shattering White. I-I-I didn't shatter Jasper. I didn't fight with [[Greg Universe|Dad]]. I- *happily* I'm Steven Universe!}}
{{TD||''(Steven sees the portrait of himself and [[Garnet]].)''}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm fine. ''I'm fine!''}}
{{TD||''(Steven shatters the glass of the sliding door to his room with his scream.)''}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]|Steven? Is that you?}}
{{TD||''([[Amethyst]] is seen running into the room, followed by Pearl, who trips on the top stair, and Garnet.)''}}
{{TD|Amethyst|What happened?}}
{{TD|Pearl|Are you okay?}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm fine.}}
{{TD||''(The Gems gasp at his appearance.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|Going to see the Diamonds was a waste of time. I thought I needed to figure myself out, but I know who I am. I'm Steven Universe! I help people, I don't... hurt them.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Dude, what's going on? You look ''really'' different.}}
{{TD|Steven|Pfft, I'm still good ol' Steven!}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven. We're worried.}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm okay. Really!}}
{{TD||''(The Gems share a concerned look.)''}}
{{TD|Garnet|We'll take your word for it.}}
{{TD|Steven|You know, everything's gone downhill since I quit running [[Little Homeworld|Little Homeschool]]. I should head over there and make myself useful! I'll see you all there.}}
{{TD||''(Steven speeds out of the room. The gems turn around in slow motion. Steven speeds out of his home and past the [[Big Donut]]. The giant donut on top leans forward as he runs past, which he stops briefly to fix. He runs straight to Little Homeworld.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|Ah, Little Homeworld. Long time, no see!}}
{{TD||''(Still speeding, Steven launches himself into the air and lands safely on the Little Homeworld [[Warp Pad]].)''}}
{{TD|Steven|Time to find someone in need of my assistance.}}
{{TD||''(The scene changes. [[Cherry Quartz]], [[Pink Pearl]], [[Peridot]], and an [[Aquamarines|Aquamarine]] are seen in Peridot's [[Little Homeworld#Greenhouse|greenhouse]]. Steven appears in a window at the back of the scene.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|What do we have here? *gasps* Peridot's horticulture class! Perfect! If anyone can get a plant to perk up, it's me.}}
{{TD||''(Steven enters the room. The same four characters, with the addition of a [[Sapphires|Sapphire]], are seen gathered around a table. Pink Pearl holds a pot of flowers over the left side of her face.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|Need some help?}}
{{TD|Peridot|Woah! Steven! What, uh, brings you back to school?}}
{{TD|Steven|Just your friendly, neighborhood "Stev-o", passing through and ready to make a difference! And I see you have a couple of struggling saplings here. I can help with that!}}
{{TD||''(Steven is preparing to lick his hands when Peridot stops him.)''}}
{{TD|Peridot|Not so fast! Amethyst says you're on a strict "No Plant Friends" policy!}}
{{TD|Steven|Aw, what? ''No.'' I'm just giving them a healthy nudge!}}
{{TD||''(Peridot looks at the plants. A leaf falls off of one of them.)''}}
{{TD|Peridot|Hmm... It is hard to see them in such sad shape. Mm, alright. Just a scientific smidge, though!}}
{{TD|Steven|*chuckles* You got it!}}
{{TD||''(Steven licks his finger. A slow shot is shown of the pink, sparkling finger approaching the plant. Suddenly, a large number of plant Stevens break the walls and ceiling of the Greenhouse. Peridot and the students of her class run out of the doors, screaming. Steven follows cautiously.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|Would you look at that? Life! It's everywhere. And, really, what's a little broken glass between friends?}}
{{TD||''(A plant Steven runs out of the greenhouse, yelling excitedly. The camera shifts to Garnet giving a counseling session to two humans.)''}}
{{TD|Garnet|Now, tell me how that makes you feel.}}
{{TD||''(Peridot screams off-screen, causing the humans to gasp in alarm and stand.)''}}
{{TD|Garnet|Alright, see you next week.}}
{{TD||''(The humans run away as Garnet summons her gauntlets. She steps forward, ready for action, as three plant Stevens surround her.)''}}
{{TD|Plant Stevens|Steven's here to help! Steven's here to help! Steven's here to help!}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, Garnet! I see you're making some new friends! Then I guess this was a net win. Welp, gotta run and help more people. It's what I do!}}
{{TD||''(As quickly as Steven entered the screen, he speeds off, as a plant Steven comes up behind him in slow motion, attempting to give him a hug. Steven comes to a stop in front of [[Bismuth (character)|Bismuth]]'s Forge.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|That's right! It must be shop-o'clock! Bismuth's shop class, that is. Time to get my shop on!}}
{{TD||''(Amethyst enters the screen, wearing a sports coach's outfit.)''}}
{{TD|Amethyst|You good, bud? You talking to yourself?}}
{{TD||''(The scene shifts. Bismuth is standing in front of her anvil with Pearl to her left. To her right, [[Yellow Pearl]] is seen modeling wedding armor, with [[Snowflake Obsidian]], [[Bixbite]], and [[Blue Pearl]] in that order following.)''}}
{{TD|Bismuth|Now, the detailing requires a light touch-}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh, hey, howdy, hey!}}
{{TD||''(The camera reveals Steven casually leaning against the door frame.)''}}
{{TD|Bismuth|Woah-ho-hoh! Looking ''good'', Steven!}}
{{TD|Steven|Why, ''thank'' you, Bismuth! So, you, uh, in need of a teaching assistant?}}
{{TD|Bismuth|Well, Pearl's my TA today, but I guess I could use a wedding expert for my wedding armor crafting demonstration!}}
{{TD|Steven|Woah... I can help with that!}}
{{TD|Bismuth|Lemme just get some steel warmed up for us.}}
{{TD||''(Bismuth pulls a bar of steel out of the coals. After morphing her fist into a hammer, she flattens out and curves the end of the bar.)''}}
{{TD|Bismuth|Alright, that looks good, for a start. Hey, Steven, help me finish shaping this pauldron?}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah! I ''got'' this.}}
{{TD|Bismuth|All yours.}}
{{TD||''(Bismuth backs out of the way and lets Steven get behind the anvil. He cracks his knuckles and raises his fist, about to punch the metal.)''}}
{{TD|Bismuth|Hold on there, boulder-brain. This is detail work! No need for a giant mallet when a humble hammer will do.}}
{{TD||''(Bismuth passes Steven a tiny hammer. He gingerly accepts it.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, yeah. Right.}}
{{TD||''(Steven gently taps the metal and the screen flashes pink upon contact. The anvil beneath the metal cracks and splits in two.)''}}
{{TD|Pearl|Ehh...}}
{{TD|Bismuth|Ahh...}}
{{TD|Steven|*laughing nervously* Ooh, look at that. Now you have ''two'' anvils.}}
{{TD|Bismuth|*falling to her knees* Noooo! My anvil! My beautiful anvil!}}
{{TD|Steven|Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, my work here is done. Well, toodles!}}
{{TD||''(Steven leaves a concerned-looking Pearl comforting Bismuth, who has her hands over her face, by speeding away. More plant Stevens pass outside Bismuth's Forge. Steven speeds his way straight into a game of baseball. A [[Nephrites|Nephrite]] is shown pitching a baseball to a [[Rubies#Little Homeworld Rubies|Ruby]]. Amethyst is to the right of the Ruby coaching the game while [[Onion]] stands next to her. At the bases are two humans and a [[Topazes|Topaz]], with [[Larimar]] in the outfield. Amethyst blows her whistle loudly.)''}}
{{TD|Amethyst|What's up, man?}}
{{TD|Steven|I wanted to see if you needed any more players, 'cause I'm ready to have a ball!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Ooh, we could use a new outfielder. Oi, Larimar, hit the showers! Steven's subbing in.}}
{{TD||''(Larimar gets up and runs off.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah, good hustle out there, buddy! Wow, I'm honored to be joining such a great game. I mean, everyone here has just been playing outstanding.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Batter up!}}
{{TD||''(Onion takes a bat and takes his place at the plate. Nephrite throws the ball and Onion hits it. It flies straight toward a window.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|The window!}}
{{TD||''(Inside the window, the [[Heaven Beetle|Heaven]] and [[Earth Beetle]]s can be seen. Steven speeds up and jumps to catch the ball. The Beetles' terrified faces are shown just before Steven catches the ball and lands safely on the ground.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|I did it.}}
{{TD||''(The other players applaud.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|I didn't mess anything up! ''YEAH!''}}
{{TD||''(Steven's scream causes a windstorm powerful enough to send Larimar flying, shatters the glass around the courtyard, and causes the Beetles' building to collapse.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh- oh... I-I'm sorry. That- that was an accident. But, what are accidents, other than new opportunities to improve, right?}}
{{TD||''(Steven looks down at the Beetles,  who look back at him with shock on their faces.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|We- we all make mistakes, and- and as long as we improve ourselves, everything is gonna be okay!}}
{{TD||''(Two plant Stevens come up on either side of Onion, laughing. Amethyst looks on with concern.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|Alright, let's get to it. Hup!}}
{{TD||''(Steven picks up a large log and walks off with it. One of the plant Stevens does the same, while the other picks up Larimar. Steven laughs nervously as he passes Amethyst.)''}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Uhh...}}
{{TD|Plant Steven|WE'RE HELPING!}}
{{TD||''(The scene changes to Steven's house. Steven himself warps in.)''}}
{{TD|Connie|Steven!}}
{{TD|Steven|Huh?}}
{{TD||''(Connie is standing next to Steven's couch while Greg, Amethyst, Pearl, and Garnet are sitting on it.)''}}
{{TD|Connie|I knew it! You ''are'' swelling and glowing again. I've been trying to call you, but I came as soon as I saw this.}}
{{TD||''(Connie holds out her phone, on which Steven, glowing and swelled up, is doing the plant Steven's dance and looping the message "Steven's here to help!")''}}
{{TD|Connie|What is going on?}}
{{TD|Steven|I... broadcast my subconscious sometimes these days. It's really no big deal.}}
{{TD|Connie|Okay, but... I can tell something is bothering you.}}
{{TD||''(Connie holds out her phone again. The message changes after some static from "Steven's here to help!" to "Steven help!" The static continues, switching the two words repeatedly.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|Ah, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm ''fine''! Awesome, in fact. Come on, you've seen me when I wasn't doing well.}}
{{TD|Greg|Steven, if being like this is what you want, then we'll support you one hundred percent. Whatever makes you happy. But, if you're not happy, if something's wrong-}}
{{TD|Steven|''Nothing's'' wrong! Besides, I don't want you to worry.}}
{{TD|Connie|We ''are'' worried!}}
{{TD|Greg|Steven, you know you can tell us anything.}}
{{TD||''(Steven looks down and frowns.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|It's not that easy. You know what? I don't have to deal with this.}}
{{TD||''(As Steven moves toward the door, Amethyst, Pearl, and Connie run to block his path. Off-screen, Garnet stands and blocks the path to the warp pad.)''}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Hold up, dude.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven! You have to stop running.}}
{{TD|Greg|''Please.''}}
{{TD||''(Steven seizes up and his face swells.)''}}
{{TD|Connie|Steven, we should get you back to the hospital.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|HOSPITAL?!}}
{{TD|Pearl|HOSPITAL?! [[Growing Pains|When were ''you'' in the hospital?!]]}}
{{TD|Connie|You didn't tell them?}}
{{TD||''(Steven groans, swelling up again. His breath quickens.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|It wasn't that important, you guys. You're making a big deal out of ''nothing''. Have I done some things wrong? ''Sure''! I trashed the house today. I broke an anvil. What teenager hasn't? [[Mr. Universe|Dad and I had a little disagreement]]. That's practically a rite of passage!}}
{{TD||''(As Connie and the Gems turn their questioning gazes to him, Greg shrugs.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|I mean, it would be weird if we ''didn't'', right? And ''maybe'', I've had a not-so-nice thought or two about, like, you know, [[Homeworld Bound|slamming White Diamond's head through a pillar]], but it's not like I actually went ''through'' with it! [[Fragments|I only ''actually'' shattered Jasper!]]}}
{{TD||''(Pearl gasps and her eyes widen with shock.)''}}
{{TD|Amethyst|'''WHAT?!'''}}
{{TD||''(Garnet's jaw drops, Greg and Connie gasp as well.)''}}
{{TD|Connie|You're- you're joking, right?}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, ''don't worry''! I fixed that too! I can fix ''anything''. I can just keep messing up and fixing things forever, and you'll never have to know or think about any of it!}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven...}}
{{TD|Steven|*gasps* How messed up is that? That I've gotten away with this for ''so long''. You have ''no idea'' how bad I am.}}
{{TD||''(While Steven talks, Pearl is shown putting her fist up to her mouth in horror. Amethyst grimaces. Connie's face remains still, frozen in shock.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|You think I'm so great, and I'm so mature, and I always know what to do, but ''that's'' not true! I haven't learned a ''thing'' from my problems! They've all just made me worse!}}
{{TD||''(Greg's face is shown while Steven rants, similar to Connie's. Garnet looks down and grimaces.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|You think of me as some angel, but, I'm ''not'' that [[Steven Universe (character)#Debut|kid]] anymore!}}
{{TD||''(A close-up of Steven's scowl is shown.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm a fraud.}}
{{TD||''(Steven falls to his hands and knees, letting out a sob. He takes a deep breath.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm a fraud!}}
{{TD||''(Steven grabs his head with both hands as his body starts shaking violently.)''}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm a '''monster!'''}}
{{TD||''(The music crescendos rapidly as massive pink spikes burst out of Steven's back, tearing his shirt. Everyone takes a step back, with plain terror displayed on Greg's face. Cut to black.)''}}
