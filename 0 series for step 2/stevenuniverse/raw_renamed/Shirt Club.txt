{{TD|Steven| *picks up the drawing and runs down the steps* [[Pearl|PEARL]]! [[Amethyst|AMETHYST]]! [[Garnet|GARNET]]! Uh-ah!}}
{{TD||(''Steven finds all the [[Crystal Gems|Gems]] are sitting on the couch in the living room.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| *reading a magazine* You don't have to yell, Steven, we're right here.}}
{{TD|Steven| I know, but I just finished this drawing, and I wanted to show it to you.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Oh! Uh... Of course.}}
{{TD|Steven| All right! *jumps on Garnet's lap and shows the Gems his flyer* Haha! "Guitar Dad teaches you guitar!"}}
{{TD|Amethyst| What ''is'' that?}}
{{TD|Steven| It's my dad. He's going to start teaching guitar lessons and he made me his P.R. Department.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *points at some crosses on Greg's mouth* What's that stuff in his mouth?}}
{{TD|Steven| Those are his teeth.}}
{{TD|Pearl| What are the lightning bolts for?}}
{{TD|Steven| Ugh... Well, ah... I was trying to show that Dad really rocks on the guitar, and...}}
{{TD|Garnet| *points at the flyer* Then there should be ''rocks'' falling out of the guitar.}}
{{TD|Steven| I hear what you're saying, but it's too late for notes... this is permanent marker.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Big Donut]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven tapes the flyer on the billboard inside the Big Donut.'')}}
{{TD|[[Sadie]]| What's that cute flyer for, Steven?}}
{{TD|Steven| It's for my dad, he'll teach you guitar, you guys wanna sign up? My dad's really good.}}
{{TD|Sadie| Maybe I'll stop by and check it out.}}
{{TD|Steven| Here, lemme give you a flyer and—}}
{{TD||(''The door bell chimes and [[Buck Dewey|Buck]] enters.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie| Welcome to the Big Donut.}}
{{TD|Steven| Hey, Buck.}}
{{TD|[[Lars]]| *surprised* Oh! W-what? *flaps his arms like a chicken* Buck, Buck, Buuuuuuuuck! Haha! *takes off his headphones* What's going on man? What can we get for you today?}}
{{TD|Buck| *looks at the menu, then at the donuts* Can I get a caprese salad?}}
{{TD|Sadie| Oh sorry, Buck. We only serve don-}}
{{TD|Lars| *barges in* DO-NUT worry, Buck! I'll whip ya up a salad, no sweat! *makes a thumb-up, sweating* I'll be right back. *runs into the break room*}}
{{TD|Sadie| Lars! We don't even have vegetables here! *runs after Lars*}}
{{TD|Buck| *looks at Steven's flyer* Heh, what's a "guitar dad"?}}
{{TD|Steven| Like my flyer? It's for my dad. *pretends to play a guitar* He'll teach you guitar! Here, take one of these with you. Actually, just wear it. *tapes a flyer onto Buck's shirt*}}
{{TD||(''Buck starts laughing uncontrollably.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Are you ticklish?}}
{{TD|Buck| This would make a rad shirt, man.}}
{{TD|Steven| Really?}}
{{TD|Buck| Yeah, let's make your flyer into T-shirts.}}
{{TD|Steven| Oh man, my dad would love that!}}

{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Abandoned Warehouse]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Buck meet up with [[Bill Dewey|Mayor Dewey]], who is unloading several boxes of campaign supplies from [[Hot 2 Tot|his van]] in the warehouse.'')}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey| Ho! I think it's swell you're returning to the family business, son. Gonna help the old man get re-elected again, eh? *hugs Buck and pats his head* Aww, son!}}
{{TD|Buck| *breaks free* Ugh! It's not for campaign stuff, dad. Steven and I are making art.}}
{{TD|Steven| *gasps* ''Art!''}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey| Art, huh? I don't understand it myself, but a boy's gotta have interests and ambitions. *slaps Buck hard on the back, causing his visor to fall off* WOAH-HO-HO-HO!}}
{{TD|Steven| *looks around at the supplies and equipment* This stuff can be used to make t-shirts?}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey| Oh yeah, I've got all the latest, state of the art screen-printing equipment from ''years'' of campaigning. And other some such, mayorly things. Like this week, I'm commemorating... a bench!}}
{{TD||(''Mayor Dewey shows the boys a banner of "Bench City", which is just a banner that reads "Welcome to Beach City", with a "N" written onto the "A" with a marker.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| "Welcome to... Bench City"? Thrifty!}}
{{TD|Buck| *moans* Dad, you can't use this.}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey| ''Why not?'' You know I "gotta gank dat youth vote, ''boi"!'' *tries to do cool poses*}}
{{TD|Buck| Dad, stop.}}
{{TD||(''Steven goes to open one of the boxes and finds several flyers, similar to Steven's. He takes one out and it reads "Vote for My Dad" with a drawing of Buck and Mayor Dewey holding hands.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| What's this?}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey| What have you got there? *takes the flyer* Aww... I haven't seen this in ''years.'' Remember when you drew this, Buck? You couldn't wait to show it off to all your li'l Montessori friends.}}
{{TD|Buck| Okay, dad. Thanks for all your help, see ya later, bye. *starts pushing Mayor Dewey out*}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey| Alright, kids. I mean... "Peace in the Middle-East, Holmes."}}
{{TD|Steven| *picks up another one of Buck's flyers* So cool.}}
{{TD|Buck| *quickly grabs and crumples the flyer* Let's just get started already.}}
{{TD||(''Buck and Steven proceed to make multiple copies of T-shirts using the equipment Mayor Dewey provided, with Steven's "Guitar Dad" flyer printed on the T-shirts.'')}}
{{TD|Buck| *admires one of the T-shirts* Swag.}}
{{TD|Steven| Now everyone's gonna want lessons from Dad!}}
{{TD|Buck| This is bigger than your dad, Steven. It's art. And it's gonna flood the public consciousness. *his visor sparkles*}}
{{TD|Steven| Let's start handing them out.}}
{{TD|Buck| Too simple. We need to get controversial. We need to create boom— a scene.}}
{{TD||[Trans. [[Funland Arcade|Funland Arcade's]] Rooftop]}}
{{TD||(''Steven is looking for victims to shoot their T-shirts at, through his binoculars, as Buck readies the [[T-Shirt Cannon]].'')}}

{{TD|Sour Cream| *using his phone* Wom, wom. Wom, wom, wom.}}
{{TD|Steven| Get ready... Take aim.}}
{{TD|Buck| Aaand... *shoots the cannon*}}
{{TD|Sour Cream| Wom, wom, wom- '''''WOMP!''''' *gets hit in the head by the T-shirt* What in the world? *picks up and examines the T-shirt* Oh. This is the coolest thing I've ever been hit in the head with!}}
{{TD|Steven| [[Ronaldo]] spotted, take aim!}}
{{TD||(''Buck fires another T-shirt and it knocks Ronaldo's fedora off of his head.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| WHOA! What the heck? Huh? *picks up the T-shirt* Whoa, weird! Some kind of extraterrestrial space dad guitar shirt? Sooo... You've finally decided to make first contact, huh? WHERE ARE YOU?!}}
{{TD|Steven| Lars sighted, take aim!}}
{{TD||(''Buck fires another T-shirt at Lars' head.'')}}

{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Fish Stew Pizza]] ]}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Buck decide to take a break and eat pizzas together.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Cheers! *chomps his pizza slice* Buck, this was such a good idea! I don't know why we didn't collaborate on a project sooner. This'll make my dad ''so'' happy. I can't wait to see the look on his face when I stop by later.}}
{{TD|Buck| *eating his pizza slice* Yeah... should be good for a laugh.}}
{{TD|Steven| Huh? Why would it be good for—}}
{{TD|[[Jenny]]| *enters Fish Stew Pizza, wearing the "Guitar Dad" T-shirt* Giiiirl! Check out my new shiiiiirt!}}
{{TD|[[Kiki]]| It's really cute. Where'd you get it?}}
{{TD|Jenny| I dunno, it just landed in front of me when I was out walking.}}
{{TD|Kiki| Well, if I were you, I wouldn't wear some random shirt that just fell out of the sky. What if there were ''bugs'' in it?}}
{{TD|Jenny| Re-lax! Who ''cares'' where it came from? This shirt is the funniest thing I've seen in my life!}}
{{TD|Buck| Looks like our shirt has a really good buzz goin'.}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah, but... I think they think it's a joke.}}
{{TD|Buck| Heh. The only thing that's important is that they're talking about it. That's how ''real'' art works.}}
{{TD|Steven| Oh. Well, I guess you're right.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[It's A Wash]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven visits his Dad and sees Sour Cream taking a picture of Greg.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| Uh... how's this? *poses*}}
{{TD|Sour Cream| Haha, ''so bad''. *takes picture*}}
{{TD|Greg| Okay, let's get started with the first lesson! Have a seat and grab a— (''Sour Cream walks off.'') Where ya goin'? Oh, uh, I guess he's got an important text or something.}}
{{TD|Steven| How's it been going today?}}
{{TD|Greg| Really great! Lots of people have been coming by thanks to your t-shirts, little guy.}}
{{TD|Steven| That's great, Dad. I'm really glad I can help...}}
{{TD|Jenny| ''Yoohoo!'' Guitar Dad! *drives by* I just wanted to say I think you're wonderful and hilarious! *drives off*}}
{{TD|Greg| Uh... thank you? Huh, that's kinda strange.}}
{{TD|Steven| What is?}}
{{TD|Greg| Well, lots of people have stopped by, but no one's taken a lesson yet.}}
{{TD|Steven| *surprised* What?! Really?!}}
{{TD|Greg| Ah, maybe they're just checking out the scene before they come back to get a REAL lesson. *starts playing his guitar*}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Abandoned Warehouse]]]}}
{{TD||(''Buck is printing more "Guitar Dad" T-shirts in the warehouse.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Buck! *runs in*}}
{{TD|Buck| Hey, there's my main man.}}
{{TD|Steven| The shirts aren't working, Buck!}}
{{TD|Buck| Yeah they are, *picks up a t-shirt* people love' em.}}
{{TD|Steven| But... nobody wants guitar lessons from my dad!}}
{{TD|Buck| That's not the point.}}
{{TD|Steven| What?! Then, what ''is'' the point?}}
{{TD|Buck| The point is, it's an amazing shirt.}}
{{TD|Steven| *blushes* Aww, my drawing's not ''that'' good, ahaha.}}
{{TD|Buck| Yeah, no. It's terrible.}}
{{TD|Steven| What?!}}
{{TD|Buck| That's what's so great about it. Your work is so naive. You really love your dad. It's ''funny.''}}
{{TD|Steven| I... I don't wanna make these shirts anymore.}}
{{TD|Buck| Too bad, Steven, it's so current, you can't stop it. I'm a taste maker, and I'm gonna keep making tastes... forever.}}
{{TD|Steven| "Forever"? *gets nervous*}}
{{TD|Buck| Well, forever after I go to my dad's lame bench commemoration... peace. *holds a peace sign above his head and walks away*}}

{{TD||(''All the Gems stand up in high alert.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| Steven.}}
{{TD|Pearl| What is it?!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Whoa, where's the fire?!}}
{{TD|Steven| It's an emergency! You have to help me get rid of all the shirts and stop Buck from making more!}}
{{TD|Pearl| Have the shirts come to life and possessed the bodies of their wearers?!}}
{{TD|Steven| No! They just-}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Are people catching on fire when they put on the magic shirts?}}
{{TD|Steven| No, no, they're just-}}
{{TD|Pearl| *spewing saliva while speaking in panic* ''Are the shirts destroying the wearer's will to continue on in this mortal coil, thereby shutting down BEACH CITY?!?''}}
{{TD|Steven| ''NO!!'' They're... *sighs* They're just... using my art in a way I don't agree with.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Oh.}}
{{TD||(''All the Gems sit back down on the couch.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| *adjusts her visor* Eh, we'll pass.}}
{{TD|Steven| What?! But... But I really need your help.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Steven, this sounds like a very abstract problem.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| It's not something we can punch. *punches her own palm*}}
{{TD|Garnet| You ''must'' learn to help ''yourself.'' ''That's'' how you become ''stronger.'' *her visor sparkles*}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Good point, good point. *nods*}}
{{TD|Pearl| Absolutely.}}
{{TD|Steven| But...!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *starts getting annoyed* Figure something ''OUT,'' Steven!}}
{{TD|Pearl| Yes! Why not dust off those conflict resolution skills?}}
{{TD|Garnet| Let your problem be known. ''Then'' you can work towards an understanding.}}
{{TD|Steven| *thinks of an idea and speaks eerily* Oh, I'll make them understand. *walks out* I'll make them ''all'' understand!}}
{{TD||(''The Gems are mildly surprised.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Eh, he'll be fine.}}
{{TD||[Trans. [[Beach City]] Boardwalk]}}
{{TD||(''Several citizens are gathered around Mayor Dewey near a bench.'')}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey| Okay, is everyone here? *blushes and clears his throat* Hello! I was ''supposed'' to write a speech to uhm... *adjusts his neck tie* Uh... commemorate this... uh... new bench! But what had happened was I ran out of printer ink in my printer, that I keep at home!}}
{{TD||(''Steven, wearing sunglasses, appears on the roof of the Funland Arcade. He opens a guitar case and takes out a T-Shirt Cannon. He loads it and takes aim towards Mayor Dewey like a sniper.'')}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey| So, I went to the store and wouldn't you know it? They didn't carry the brand I was looking for, so-}}
{{TD|Steven| *whispering* ''Bye''.}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey| -I called up a buddy of mine who owed me a...}}
{{TD||(''Everything turns into slow motion as Steven fires a T-shirt at Mayor Dewey.'')}}

{{TD|Mayor Dewey (Slow motion)| No!}}
{{TD|Bodyguard #2 (Slow motion)| Aaaah! *runs away*}}

{{TD|Mayor Dewey| I've been... ''shirt.''}}

{{TD|Mayor Dewey| Buck... *looking at a T-shirt, feeling touched* Did you make this?}}
{{TD||(''Buck is speechless. He looks over and sees Sour Cream and Jenny looking at the T-shirts too.'')}}
{{TD|Jenny| Ahahaha! This shirt is genius! *laughs with Sour Cream* This is ''way'' funnier than "Guitar Dad"!}}
{{TD|Lars| Ahahahahahaha, ohoho! *holds a T-shirt, laughing aloud*}}
{{TD|Mayor Dewey| *stops blushing and looks at the T-shirt* This bench is actually pretty comfortable.}}

{{TD||(''Steven meets up with Greg again at his car wash.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Anyone else stop by for lessons today?}}
{{TD|Greg| So far, no, but I'm sure it'll pick up tomorrow.}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah! I'm sure it will. *hands Greg a T-shirt* Oh, this is for you by the way. This is the ''last'' one so it's ''super'' limited edition.}}
{{TD|Greg| Aw, sweet! Thanks, Steven.}}
{{TD||(''Steven smiles.'')}}
{{TD|Buck| Yo, Steven. *walks in* Just wanted to say uh... I'm sorry for what I did, and... uh...}}
{{TD|Steven| It's okay, Buck. You don't have to say any more than that.}}
{{TD|Buck| You're a cool cat, Steven Universe. *turns to Greg* Hey, Mr. U.}}
{{TD|Greg| You wanna take a picture with me or some junk?}}
