{{TD|Pearl|How could you possibly think punching a blood polyp was a good idea? Look at all the ''gunk'' you got on me! *flicks away a small piece of gunk on her arm* And look at ''[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]!''}}
{{TD|Steven|*is covered in thick gunk except for his face* It's not so bad once you get used to it.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|See? He likes it.}}
{{TD|Pearl|He certainly won't like it when it hardens.}}
{{TD|Steven|*starts to worry* Uhh, what? Umm, I'm gonna go wash. *waddles away*}}
{{TD|Pearl|*off-screen* He shouldn't have been so close in the first place.}}
{{TD||(''Steven waddles towards the fridge, when the gunk hardens him in place.'')}}

{{TD|Steven|Uh, guys?}}
{{TD|Pearl|You're always putting us in danger with your little outbursts! (''Amethyst puts her fingers in her ears and sticks out her tongue playfully.'') Ugh, you are just... so... CHILDISH!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Yeah, yeah. And don't forget "reckless", "vulgar", "loud mouth". And that's just what makes me so awesome! *yells* RIGHT, [[Garnet|GARNET]]?!}}

{{TD|Amethyst|Come here. Let me explain something to you. (''Steven shuffles towards Amethyst and she wraps his arm around him.'') In the ring, NOBODY can tell me what to do! And if they try, I HIT 'EM IN THE FACE WITH A CHAIR!}}
{{TD|Steven|And people... like that?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|"Like it"? They ''love'' it! Ha! Well, they hate it, but it's all part of the fun, you know? E-Everyone here gets that. Urggh! You don't know what it's like having Pearl and Garnet on your back all the time!}}
{{TD|Steven|Are you kidding me?! *impersonates Pearl* "Oh, Steven, I told you before not to take peanut butter on missions." *impersonates Garnet* "I'm not going to say anything, but I expect you to understand that was wrong."}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*chuckles*}}
{{TD|Steven|Let me be a wrestler with you! I'm so stifled!}}

{{TD|Steven|*into the microphone* Wait! I want to tell you Purple Puma's backstory. He was the wildest cat in the jungle, so wild, the other cats couldn't take it. So she, I mean he, went to look for somewhere he fit in, somewhere with other people who felt misunderstood.}}
{{TD|Sadie|That really sounds like Steven.}}
{{TD|Lars|Shh!}}
{{TD|Steven|That's why we're all here. To be wild and free, and body slam each other, and wear cool costumes, and make up nicknames and uh... so can't we just have this? Can't we just wrestle?}}
{{TD||(''Garnet walks over and takes the microphone.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|No!}}
