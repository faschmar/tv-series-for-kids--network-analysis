{{TD|Steven| This is it, folks. Rookie sensation Steven Universe readies his last spoon full of [[Minor Objects/Food#Colonel Kernel's Classic Creamed Corn|Colonel Kernel's Classic Creamed Corn.]] As the crowd waits with bated breath, one bite between him... and destiny. *takes an spoonful of cream corn and swallows it* And he's done it! He's eaten four cans of creamed corn!}}
{{TD||(''The [[Temple Gate]] opens and the [[Crystal Gems|Gems]] walk out of [[Pearl's Room]].'')}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]| Good afternoon, Steven.}}
{{TD|Steven| Guys, check this out! *gathers the empty cans off the kitchen counter*}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]| Stoo-man in the house! Whatcha got? Whatcha got?}}
{{TD|Steven| I got four empty cans of Colonel Kernel's Classic Creamed Corn!}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]| ... Cool.}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah, and on the back, are five dollar coupons for mini-golf. I ate four cans, so we all can go together.}}
{{TD|Pearl| That's so thoughtful, Steven. Unfortunately though, uhh...}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *shrugs* We gotta go on a mission...}}
{{TD|Steven| What? *drops the cans in shock* Not again! But you guys promised we'd hang out!}}
{{TD|Garnet| A dangerous artifact has appeared in the Northern Hemisphere, we need to go retrieve it. *walks towards the [[Warp Pad]]*}}
{{TD|Steven| But mini-golf is so much fun! There's castles, and windmills, and I like it, and- oh look, look what I brought! *runs to the living room* I pulled out my dad's old clubs and also found a pair of his old golf pants. They're a little big on me, but you can wear them, Garnet!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl and Amethyst chuckle while Garnet's face remains expressionless. The Gems then step on the warp pad.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| See ya, buddy!}}
{{TD|Pearl| We'll bring you something back!}}
{{TD||(''The Gems warp away. Steven sighs heavily and falls backwards onto the ground.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Well, you're not the only ones with a dangerous adventure to tackle.}}
{{TD||(''Steven starts to play Mini Golf Quest and eat chips. In-game, a professor hands the player a golf club.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Awww yeah! You received the Mythril Putter! *imitates game sound and starts reading the characters' dialogues* "Don't worry Professor. We're gonna sink 'em all!" *chuckles*}}
{{TD||(''Steven advances in the game, when he encounters his first in-game enemy, a walking windmill.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Uh oh. Oh windmill. Why must we always fight? *begins fighting the windmill enemy* Man, it would've been ''just'' like this!}}
{{TD||(''Steven keeps playing until the next day. He eventually made it to and defeats the final boss, revealing to be the professor at the start of the game.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| "I can't lose! I am the greatest golfer in the ''Universe!''" *makes explosion sounds, as the game ends, and laughs* Alright! Secret ending!}}
{{TD|Pearl| Hey, Steven! We're back~!}}
{{TD|Steven| Hey.}}
{{TD||(''A cutscene from the game begins to play on the TV screen. The main in-game character, named [[Minor Characters/Fictional#Ace|Ace]], stands in front of a mechanical door.'')}}

{{TD||(''Amethyst suddenly pops in from above and blocks Steven's view.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| HEY, STEVEN! Wanna hear about where we've been?}}
{{TD|Steven| Unâ€” Oh! Wait! Wait, hold on! *pushes Amethyst's head aside*}}
{{TD|Ace| *wiping the fog on the cryogenic capsule* June 9, 2014? But that was the date he disappeared!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst then tumbles in front of Steven, completely blocking his view.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Hey!}}
{{TD|Garnet| Steven! Look at this. *plants an artifact on the bedroom floor*}}
{{TD||(''Ace keeps talking in the background.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| It's the [[Wailing Stone]] we found!}}
{{TD|Garnet| The Wailing Stone ''I'' found.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Isn't it neat? It uses high-frequency sound waves as a message relay...}}
{{TD|Steven| *trying to watch the game cutscene* Guuuys!}}
{{TD|Pearl| ...Between two fixed points in space and time!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Look, you just have to push ''this!'' *presses the top of the Wailing Stone*}}
{{TD||(''The Wailing Stone activates and emits a loud piercing noise, forcing everyone to cover their ears and even breaking the TV. Pearl quickly pushes the top of the Wailing Stone, turning it off.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| Amethyst, I told you not to turn it on the house!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Hahaha! Chill out, P. It's not like anyone got hurt, and Steven ''loved'' it! *sees a dazed Steven* Steven?}}
{{TD|Steven| THAT WAS THE SECRET ENDING! Now I have to replay the final dungeon all over again! It's not ''fair!'' I can't go mini-golfing, I can't play my game, I can't stop going into the bathroom because I ate all that Creamed Corn, so much corn... *sighs* I just wish I had a place for myself.}}
{{TD||(''Steven's [[Gemstone|gem]] suddenly starts glowing, and he lifts up his shirt to inspect it.'')}}

{{TD||(''The Gems collectively warn Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl & Amethyst| Steven, wait!}}
{{TD|Garnet| Steven, don't go in there!}}
{{TD|Steven| It's never about what ''I'' wanna do, is it? Well now we have a place where I'm going and YOU CAN'T ''COME!!'' *stomps into the room*}}
{{TD|Pearl, Amethyst, & Garnet| ''STEVEN!''}}
{{TD||(''The door closes up behind Steven, separating him from the Gems.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| YES!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Rose's Room (location)|Rose's Room]]]}}
{{TD||(''The door poofs into pink clouds and disappears...'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Woah... *starting walking and looking around the room* So this is my mom's room? She must've liked clouds a lot. But what kind of room doesn't even have a bed?}}
{{TD||(''A bed suddenly appears underneath Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Woah! Cool! Hm... This bed is pretty nice. But you know what would be really nice? Quadruple-bunk beds!}}
{{TD||(''The bed elevates Steven up high and turns into a quadruple bunk bed complex.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| With a slide! (''A slide appears beside the top bed, and Steven get on it.'') WOO-HOO! *launches from the slide into the air* A parachute!

{{TD||(''A donut appears.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| *laughs* Alright! *tries to eat the donut, but it poofs away* Wha...? Hey! I want a ''real'' donut!}}
{{TD||(''Another donut appears. Steven tries to eat it, and again, it poofs away.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| What?! Can you believe this?}}
{{TD||(''The Tiny Floating Whale responds in tiny whale sounds.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Now I have to go out for donuts!}}

{{TD||(''Steven exits the building through the back door and finds that the sky has turned dark, and the town of [[Beach City]] looking rather desolate. He looks around and sees [[Onion]] standing under a streetlight.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Huh? Hey, Onion! Have you seen Lars and Sadie? They should have just been out here! (''Onion just glances and grins at Steven.'') Hey, if you see them, let me know. Okay? Here, have a donut. *pokes Onion with the donut, and he does not react* I'll leave it here for you. *puts the donut on Onion's head* See you later!}}
{{TD||(''Steven walks along the boardwalk to search for Lars and Sadie, passing by [[Beach Citywalk Fries]] without noticing [[Frybo (character)|Frybo]] standing inside the counter.'')}}

{{TD|[[Greg]]| *exits the building* Steven!}}
{{TD|Steven| Dad! Is that you?}}
{{TD|Greg| What? Of course! You doing alright? You look like you saw a ghost. Either that, or you stayed up all night playing a video game.}}
{{TD|Steven| Dad, I'm freaking out. I feel like I'm stuck inside of some crazy dream!}}
{{TD|Greg| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don't we share some of those donuts and you can tell me about this crazy night you're having? *starts to eat a donut*}}
{{TD|Steven| The Gems were trying to tell me something about Mom's Room. But I was so mad that I didn't listen. They're always leaving me behind, and... I guess I wanted to do it to them, too.}}
{{TD|Greg| That's not so bad. Everyone needs some alone time now and then. *starts air-guitaring*}}
{{TD|Steven| *laughs* Yeah. It was really fun for a while. But now, the whole city; everyone and everything is acting really weird.}}
{{TD|Greg| Well the important thing is you told the truth.}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah, I... ''guess'' I ''did.''}}
{{TD||(''Greg air-guitars again.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Uh, Dad? Your advice is making less sense than usual.}}

{{TD|Tiny Floating Whale| *pops in, with Rose's voice* What ''do'' you want, Steven?}}
{{TD|Steven| I want to be back with the Gems!}}

{{TD|Steven| *gasps* You're not clouds!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Alright, Steven! *bites Pearl's arm*}}
{{TD|Pearl| *in pain* AGHUUHH!!!}}
{{TD|Steven| Guys, it was awful! I was trapped in a messed up version of [[Beach City]]. Everyone was acting super weird and...}}

{{TD|Pearl| *hits Amethyst's face with her elbow* It can't handle a task like that! Thank goodness you're OK!}}
{{TD|Steven| *sighs* I'm sorry I got mad, guys. I get it now. Things can't always go exactly how I want.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Oh Steven, we're sorry, too.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Mm-hmm.}}
{{TD|Garnet| But guess what? We have time to hang out, now.}}
