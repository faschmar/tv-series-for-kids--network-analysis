{{TD||[Open Ext. [[Big Donut]]]}}
{{TD||(''It is already late at night, [[Sadie Miller|Sadie]] and [[Lars Barriga|Lars]] are closing up the Big Donut for the night. Lars first exits through the back door ahead of Sadie, playing with the keys at the door lock.'')}}
{{TD|Lars| *teasingly* Saaaaa-dieee!~ Better hurry up, I'm gonna lock you in!}}
{{TD|Sadie| *from inside* Hey, just a sec!}}
{{TD||(''Lars leans against the wall to wait for Sadie, when he looks down and get startled by the sudden appearance of [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] in front of him.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Don't be ''too'' scared. It's just me. *leans on the wall besides Lars* I'm on my way over to a spooky-movie party. You want to come?}}
{{TD|Lars| Party? ... Who's throwing it?}}
{{TD|Steven| [[Ronaldo Fryman|Ronaldo]], the French Fryman.}}
{{TD|Lars| Ugh! That social napalm? Do what you want, man, I got better things to do than wax weird with [[Beach City|Beach City's]] biggest bozo... *mockingly* Ronaldo.}}
{{TD|Sadie| *exits the Big Donut* Ah, okay. Oh, ha! Nice timing, Steven. Hey, should we head over to Ronaldo's?}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah! Imma get so scared! *hugs Sadie*}}
{{TD|Sadie| *laughs* Night, Lars. *waves*}}
{{TD|Steven| Nighty-night! *walks away with Sadie*}}
{{TD|Lars| *runs after them* Hey, wait up! *returns quickly to lock the door, and runs back to Sadie and Steven* So, where's this thing at?}}
{{TD|Steven| *pointing* It's right up there.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[The Lighthouse]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven, Sadie and Lars climbs the hill towards the Lighthouse, decorated with scarecrows outside. Steven knocks on the door and Ronaldo, wearing a mask and costume, opens the door.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| *knocking*}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Steeeeeveeeeen...! *speaks dramatically* Welcome to my Beach City horror club! *laughs maniacally*}}
{{TD|Lars| *laughs aloud* More like comedy club. *continues to laugh*}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Lars?! *accidentally drops his mask on ground, and it breaks* Oh! What are you doing here?! Um... *clears the doorway* C-C-Come in.}}
{{TD|Lars| *elbows Sadie, still laughing* I'm scared already.}}
{{TD|Sadie| Ronaldo, right? Yeah. I'm Sadie. *goes to shakes Ronaldo's hand* Nice to finally officially meet you.}}
{{TD||(''Sadie and Lars step past Ronaldo into the Lighthouse. Lars suddenly turns around and shouts a single "Boo!", startling Ronaldo. He laughs again as he walks back into the Lighthouse. Steven is about to step inside when Ronaldo halts him.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Steven, you're friends with Lars?}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah, isn't everybody?}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| *breathes deeply and stomps inside* Oh, boy!}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah! *closes the door behind him*}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. The Lighthouse]}}
{{TD||(''Inside the lantern room of the Lighthouse, Steven, Sadie and Lars are seated in front of a big TV.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Our first film tonight is a rare classic that hardly needs introduction; *holds up a movie cover box* "Evil Bear 2: Bearly Alive"!}}
{{TD|Lars| What?! I've seen that! It's boring! And that stupid fake C.G. bear! Hardly looks like it's really killing anybody.}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| C.G.?! Blasphemer! *inches towards Lars* You saw the remake! I have the original. A true fan would accept nothing less.}}
{{TD|Lars| Whoa, man, take it down a notch. (''Ronaldo covers his face in embarrassment.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie| Whoa, wait. How did you get a copy of that? Can I see the box? (''Ronaldo walks over and presents the cover box.'') Woah! In this cut, you actually see Evil Bear eat the hermit's leg. Ho! Oh, is this gonna be a bit much for him?}}
{{TD|Steven| I can handle it!}}
{{TD||[Time-Skip— Later that night]}}
{{TD||(''Steven watches the movie, unfazed as bear growling and woman screaming are heard, when Ronaldo peeks over and reveals that Steven is just sitting behind the couch.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Yo, Steven, are you sure you can see with the couch in your way?}}
{{TD|Movie Hermit Man| ''You're... eating my... leg!''}}
{{TD||(''Steven cowers in fright as more screaming and the bear's evil laughter are heard.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Oh, did I miss the part where you can see the sound guy?}}
{{TD||(''The power in the Lighthouse suddenly goes out, turning off the TV.'')}}
{{TD|Lars| Hey, it was just getting good!}}
{{TD|Sadie| What's going on?}}
{{TD|Lars| Probably just a fuse.}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| *shines a flashlight on his face* Or maybe it's a ''gho-o-st''?}}
{{TD|Sadie| *chuckles and nervously smiles* Good one.}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| *hands another flashlight to Sadie* No, really. What if it's a ''gho-o-o-o-st''? *rummages through his cabinet of files* As a skeptic of mortality, I've long suspected that this place might be haunted. *pulls out a pendulum* Aha! Spirit, I beseech you!}}
{{TD|Lars| Dude, cut it out. You're being super weird.}}
{{TD||(''Sadie and Steven gather around Ronaldo's pendulum, as Sadie shines her flashlight on it.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| We wish to make contact. Please, spirit, send us a sign.}}
{{TD||(''The pendulum begins to swing around on its own accord, shoots off of Ronaldo's hands and hits Lars in his face.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Woah!}}
{{TD|Lars| Ow!}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Spirit, that was a good sign. But could you send a couple more like that just to be sure?}}
{{TD||(''Indistinct whispering are heard. The drawers of the cabinet suddenly burst open and files come flying out, swirling in circles above Ronaldo, Steven, Sadie and Lars. Everyone screams in shock.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| That's— That's okay, spirit, you can rein it in a little!}}
{{TD||(''A cup of coffee flies in and smashes in front of the group.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie| How is this happening?!}}
{{TD|Steven| This... is amazing! A real-life haunted house! Ah!}}
{{TD||(''A barrel smashes to the ground next to Steven, barely misses him as he jumps into Ronaldo's arms. Another cup of coffee hovers in the air and flies towards Lars.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie| Look out! *tackles Lars down, and the coffee cup misses him* Let's get out of here!}} 
{{TD||(''The group runs towards the door, but it suddenly slams shut. Ronaldo pulls on the door knob with no luck.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| It won't open!}}
{{TD||(''The group then slams themselves through the door, successfully breaking it and exiting the lantern room. The door then mends itself from the broken pieces.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| I'm so sorry! I had no idea there was this violent of a presence here.}}
{{TD|Steven| It happens.}}
{{TD|Lars| No, it doesn't! It's not a ghost!}}
{{TD|Sadie| Who cares what it is? We need to get out of here!}} 
{{TD||(''The group starts descending down the spiraling staircase of the Lighthouse.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| You know, I deal with this kind of stuff on a regular basis, but, uh, you, uh, looked pretty cool back there.}}
{{TD|Sadie| Yeah?}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Yeah. You really took charge.}}
{{TD|Sadie| When stuff gets hairy, I just keep my eyes forward, you know.}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Once the civilians are safe, I'm gonna come back to investigate, if you wanted to help.}}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo and Sadie chuckle together, and Steven notices Lars getting unrest.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Something wrong, Lars?}}
{{TD|Lars| *covers Steven's mouth with both hands* Oh, shh!}}
{{TD||(''Eerie laughter of children is suddenly heard.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie| What is that?}}
{{TD|Lars| Oh, it's nothing! We're all just hearing things and seeing things and feeling things that aren't real.}}
{{TD||(''Lars runs ahead towards the front door, when it suddenly swings open and smashes him in the face, knocking him backwards. The scarecrows outside are now animated and creeping towards the group. Sadie and Ronaldo quickly lean themselves against the door, attempting to force it closed from the scarecrows. A few bats and a scarecrow manage to slip through the door, and they begin to attack Lars. Steven manages to pry the scarecrow and bats away from Lars and tosses them out the door, which Sadie and Ronaldo finally manage to shut afterwards.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie| Have you ever seen a haunting this bad?}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| This is no run-of-the-mill haunting. *shines his flashlight onto his own face* It's a poltergeist. A "ghost" only haunts a house. A poltergeist haunts a person. They're usually attracted to the terrifying inner world of the emotionally disturbed. *shines his flashlight onto Lars*}}
{{TD|Lars| *sweats nervously, then walks forwards angrily* You think stuff is coming after me?! How can you listen to this weird guy?! He practically lives in a haunted house! Don't you think maybe ''he'' had something to do with it?}}
{{TD|Steven| I think you can stop being such a dink to Ronaldo!}}
{{TD|Lars| *groans in frustration and runs toward Sadie* Sadie, you're not an idiot!}}
{{TD|Steven & Ronaldo| Hey!}}
{{TD|Lars| *grabs Sadie by her shoulder* Do you believe all of this?!}}
{{TD|Sadie| I...}}
{{TD|Lars| All this stuff: they've gotta be doing it somehow. We've gotta ditch these guys, come on.}}
{{TD||(''Sadie furiously backs away from Lars.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie| *crosses her arms* I'm not ditching anyone.}}
{{TD|Lars| But what about me, huh?! Sadie, c'mon, you'll always know!}}
{{TD||(''The floorboards suddenly open up underneath Sadie, revealing a glowing red void, and Sadie falls into it, screaming. Lars tries to rush forwards to save her but the floorboards close up, swallowing Sadie as her screams fade away, leaving just her flashlight behind.'')}}
{{TD|Lars| Sadie?}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| The spirit took her! *turns to Lars* You're gonna drag us all down with you! Don't you even care?}}
{{TD|Sadie| *distantly and weakly* Laaars...}}
{{TD||(''A hatch on the floor suddenly opens up.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| The basement!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Basement of Lighthouse]}}
{{TD||(''The trio descends into the basement, which is illuminated by the eerie red glow.'')}}
{{TD|Lars| I don't see her anywhere!}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Spirit, show yourself!}}
{{TD|Steven| It's close. *places his hand on the lighthouse structure* I can feel it. It's hurting and... obsessed.}}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo shines his flashlight to a wall, and the trio notices a pulsing flesh-like structure with Lars' name carved into it.'')}}
{{TD|Lars| *shudders* Ahh...}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| It should have been you.}}
{{TD|Lars| Wh-What?!}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| It took her, but it should have been you, Lars!}}
{{TD|Steven| Whoa! Hold on, Ronaldo!}}
{{TD|[[White Topaz|Spirit]]| *eerily* ''Laaarrrrsssss.''}}
{{TD||(''A mouth opens up in the wall below the pulsing flesh. Ronaldo grapples Lars and starts dragging him towards it.'')}}
{{TD|Lars| Hey, let go!}}
{{TD|Steven| *runs in front of Ronaldo* Wait, stop! What are you doing?!}}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo lifts Lars above his head, causing him to scream in fear.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Spirit, I deliver the package of darkness! Return to us the innocent Sadie!}}
{{TD|Spirit| ''Laaarrrrsssss!''}}
{{TD|Lars| C-Come on, man! We used to be friends!}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| And you threw me away! *throws Lars into the mouth*}}
{{TD|Lars| AAAHH!}}
{{TD|Steven| Lars! *runs towards Lars and into the mouth*}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| No, Steven, he's not worth it!}}
{{TD|Lars| Why does everything bad happen to me?!}}
{{TD||(''The mouth pins Steven and Lars down with its tongue. Its teeth begin to slowly come down in an attempt to sever Steven and Lars in half. Ronaldo watches in horror, when Steven summons his bubble shield, protecting himself and Lars. He then expands the bubble, causing the mouth to stretch and explode. The bubble rolls Steven and Lars away to safety before popping. Sadie then emerges from the rubble of the wall, coughing and gasping, along with a [[Gemstone]].'')}}
{{TD|Steven, Ronaldo & Lars| Sadie!}}
{{TD|Steven| *holds up the gem* It's a gem.}}
{{TD||(''The gem starts to glow, enveloping the place in a bright light, and begins to project a holographic flashback of a younger Lars and Ronaldo.'')}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| This is the perfect clubhouse for the Beach City Explorer Club! *laughs*}}
{{TD|Young Lars| Secret clubhouse, right, Ronnie? *makes mouth zipping motions* Zip!}}
{{TD||(''The group watches the holograph, as Steven laughs and Lars groans.'')}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| Lars, you're a riot!}}
{{TD||(''Young Ronaldo is playing with a camera, when he is startled by some scraping noises.'')}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| Dude!}}
{{TD|Young Lars| *etching his name into the wall with a screwdriver* Just carving our names in. Pretty metal, huh?}}
{{TD||(''Young Lars sticks the screwdriver into the wall, causing the whole place to rumble.''}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| Weird...}}
{{TD||(''A wooden board from the wall then springs outwards and knocks Young Lars away. Young Ronaldo quickly snaps a photo of it.'')}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| Holy smokes! The clubhouse is possessed! *runs over to Lars and shows him the photo* Lars, Lars, when you turn on the TV tomorrow, this is what's gonna be on every station!}}
{{TD|Young Lars| *sweating nervously* B-B-But— But you said this was secret.}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| Our first paranormal discovery! We're gonna take on the world together!}}
{{TD|Young Lars| Um... Let me just... Uh, I'll just, uh... *begins tearing the photo into pieces*}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| *gasps* No! What are you doing?! No-no-no-no-no-no!}}
{{TD|Young Lars| I'm just tearing myself out.}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| Stop! *grabs Lars and reaches for the remains of the photo* Let me... see! *yanks Lars' arm down and retrieves the torn photo* What'd you do? Ohh!}}
{{TD|Young Lars| Oh, come on, Ronnie... You know I can't let people see me like that.}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| What?! What's the matter with you?! *shoves Lars* Don't you know how important this was?!}}
{{TD||(''Young Lars and Young Ronaldo begin wrestling one another. Young Lars then steps on Young Ronaldo's foot and starts running away.'')}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| Aah! Why do you care so much about what other people think?!}}
{{TD|Young Lars| *tearing up* You wouldn't say that if you knew what other people say about YOU!}}
{{TD||(''As the group watches, Ronaldo is visibly angry while Lars cowers in shame. Young Lars runs away and disappears in the flashback'')}}
{{TD|Young Ronaldo| Lars?}}
{{TD||(''Young Ronaldo vanishes too, and the projection ends.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Aah! *starts speaking to the gem* Okay, shh. I've got you. When you were stuck in the wall, was the house like your body? You must have felt like you were under attack back when Lars carved his name in you.}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Can I see that?}}
{{TD|Steven| Uh, sorry. We should let it rest. *bubbles the gem and sends it away to [[The Burning Room]]*}}
{{TD|Sadie| So, all that lashing out was just from feeling hurt and trapped for so long.}}
{{TD|Lars| I didn't mean to rip it up, okay? *looks away* You can stop talking about me now.}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Wait! Oh, Sadie, are you okay?}}
{{TD|Sadie| Uh, yeah. I'm fine.}}
{{TD|Lars| Oh, yeah. *chuckles* We were both worried about— I mean, I ran down here faster.}}
{{TD|Sadie| *pause* Can we get out of here?}}
{{TD|Steven| Sadie, you can come with me. I think these two have a lot to talk about.}}
{{TD|Sadie| I bet. *walks away with Steven*}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| I wasn't trying to make you look bad.}}
{{TD|Lars| *hastily tries to leave* Ahhh, whatever, It didn't matter, I don't care!}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Hey, Lars. Take it down a notch.}}
{{TD||(''The star iris begins zooming in on Lars' annoyed/embarrassed face.'')}}
{{TD|Lars| *blushes* Aah!}}
