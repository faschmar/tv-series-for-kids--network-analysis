{{TD|[[Pearl]]| That could have gone... a lot worse. *smiles*}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]| Could have gone a lot ''better'' too.}}

{{TD|Connie| *through Steven's phone* Steven? I got your message.  ...Steven? What happened?}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]| We won!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst grabs Steven by surprise and twirls him around in joy. [[Lion]] inches in and nuzzles Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| *on phone, from her home* Is that Amethyst? Ah... what's going on? You said that there's some kind of giant space hand and you all may die?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *yells through the phone* Wooohooo! Ye-he-he-he! *noogies Steven*}}
{{TD|Steven| Connie! You're not going to believe what happened. Where do I even start?!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *off screen* I see you, P!}}
{{TD|Steven| It's been a madhouse over here.}}

{{TD|Steven| Huh?}}
{{TD|Greg| ''STEVEN!''}}
{{TD|Steven| ''Dad!'' *turns to Connie on the phone* Connie I-I have to go. I promise I'll call you back. *hangs up his phone* Dad's back! Dad's back! *runs towards Greg*}}
{{TD|Greg| *running to Steven* Oh! Thank goodness you're okay! *hugs Steven tightly* Mmmmm! I saw the spaceship start to leave and then it crashed so I came back and... *sees Steven's black eye* Ohhh... Your eye... But you're okay! I guess those jerks were no match for the [[Crystal Gems]]!}}
{{TD|Steven| No way, they were super strong!}}
{{TD|Greg| But you were able to beat them back?}}
{{TD|Steven| No. They totally ''stomped'' us! This warrior, [[Jasper]], was super beefy and knocked me unconscious. Then they abducted me onto the ship because they wanted to take me away forever. And then we crashed the ship and I almost died!}}
{{TD|Greg| *increasingly worried and panicked* What did they want with you?!}}
{{TD|Steven| They think I'm [[Rose Quartz|Mom]].}}
{{TD|Greg| *stammering* A-are more [[Homeworld Gems]] gonna come after you?}}
{{TD|Steven| I... uh... I don't know. Maybe?}}
{{TD|Greg| *clearly distraught* Steven. I-I'm supportive and very proud of you. And I'll be right back. *runs back into his van* Got to calm down. Where's my... *picks up lots of CDs from the back of the van* Where's my relaxing music CD? This one? *puts a CD in the radio, and death metal music starts to play* Wrong one! Stop! Eject! *punches the radio and tries to calm down*}}
{{TD||(''Steven watches the commotion as Greg tries to calm himself down, when his phone starts to ring again, realizing it is Connie. He looks back at his clearly-panicking dad as his van breaks down.'')}}

{{TD||(''Steven is walking along the beach, staring at Connie's contact on his phone and mumbling to himself.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Now Connie. Please don't freak out. But a giant laser hand tried to steal me into space. But it didn't, it didn't. I'm back and everything is fine... now...}}
{{TD||(''Steven approaches the [[Big Donut]] and realizes the glass door and windows are broken. He starts running away when his phone rings again. He continues mumbling to him, not picking up the call.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Um... Connie. Funny story. As it turns out, there's a lot more [[Gems]] out there than we thought. And I think they wanna... kill me? Aghhh! Ughhh!}}
{{TD||(''Steven walks along the boardwalk when he accidentally trips over a broken parts of the Gem warship. He looks around and see the boardwalk area littered in rubble and pieces of the warship. His phone rings again, startling him.'')}}

{{TD||(''Steven runs away from the scene. He starts treading up a hill overlooking [[Beach City]], panting heavily and irritated by his phone constantly. He then looks around the hill and observes the broken wreckage of the Gem warship on the beach in discomfort.'')}}
{{TD|[[Ronaldo]]| *appears from behind* Yooo!}}
{{TD|Steven| Oh! Hey Ronaldo.}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Didn't you hear? [[Bill Dewey|Mayor Dewey]] is calling everyone back into the city. We can go home now. *looks at the sky*}}
{{TD||(''Steven looks at Ronaldo sadly.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| ''Oh!'' I see... you come up here to brood too.}}
{{TD|Steven| Brood?}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Yes, Steven. That's just what people like us do. Suffer quietly, shouldering the knowledge no one else can bear.}}
{{TD|Steven| Hm.}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| As an aficionado of the weird yourself, you've probably noticed ordinary people fear the cold, leaded anchor of the truth. The abyss is no Sunday swan drive.}}
{{TD|Steven| I know! My dad flipped out when I told him.}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| *sternly* Sounds typical. But it's a good reminder. This is no easy path we've chosen here. There are... sacrifices. Look at them all down there, Steven. *points towards Beach City* It's our duty to let those simple people live out their simple lives, without ever knowing the burden of being friends with us.}}
{{TD|Steven| At least we can be there for each other.}}
{{TD|Ronaldo| Is that giant hand from the sky sitting ''right'' in the middle of the ''beach''?! I gotta get some of this for my blog!}}
{{TD||(''Ronaldo runs off. Steven continues staring out from the [[Brooding Hill]] and he starts to sing "[[Full Disclosure (song)|Full Disclosure]]".'')}}

{{TD|Garnet| No whining. We need to start cleaning up debris.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Garnet's right. People are already coming back into town.}}
{{TD|Steven| We've got to keep them off the beach. If any humans got access to gem technology, they could really hurt themselves. *closes the window blinds* Maybe we should shut them out. For good.}}
{{TD|Pearl| You know... We did [[Story for Steven|once have a fence]]. Let's get a new one. With barbed wire!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| This time, let's build a moat. I could be... *shapeshifts her head into a crocodile* The crocodile! ''Jazz hands''!}}
{{TD|Garnet| No.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Why not?}}
{{TD|Pearl| You always say you'll be the crocodile, but you never commit!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst shapeshifts her head back to normal.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| No fence either.}}
{{TD|Pearl & Amethyst| Garnet!}}
{{TD|Garnet| Steven needs to see his father and his friends.}}
{{TD|Steven| No, I don't! I can't keep clinging to the vestiges of my humanity. It's time I got ''serious''.}}
{{TD||(''Steven's phone rings again in his pocket, causing him to cringe and moan.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| Steven? Why is your communication device making that sound?}}
{{TD|Steven| It's Connie, trying to call me, but I can't face her anymore.}}
{{TD|Pearl| So you're just going to ignore her, forever?}}
{{TD|Steven| It's the responsible thing to do.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *peeking thorough the blinds* It's gonna be hard, 'cause she's coming up the steps right now.}}
{{TD|Steven| What?!}}
{{TD||(''Connie climbs up the stairs to the Beach House and knocks on the door. Pearl comes and opens it.'')}}
