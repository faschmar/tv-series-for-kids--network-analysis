{{TD||(''The [[Crystal Gems]] arrives by warping to the [[Warp Pad]] at the Gem Communication Hub.'')}}
{{TD|[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]|*looks up amazed* Woah! What magical place of mysteries is this?}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]|Well...}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]|*interrupts Amethyst* Oh, I'm so glad you asked! This was once a communication hub for [[Gems|Gem-kind]]. *walks over to the pillars of the hub* But lately, it's begun transmitting bursts of electromagnetic interference!}}
{{TD|Steven|Whazzat mean?}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]|It's hurting television.}}
{{TD|Steven|Noooooooo! I'll save you television! HA-YAH! *tries to kick and push over a pillar*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*lifts Steven up* Sorry, but we need a Steven at least... this strong for this job! *shapeshifts into a stronger-looking Steven with a deeper voice*}}
{{TD|Steven|*gasps* It's all the me I could be!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst puts Steven down, and starts punching at the pillar as the strong Steven. Pearl catches a small piece of the pillar punched off by Amethyst and begins lecturing her.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Amethyst, we could be here all day taking out these pillars individually.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Ugh, I hate it when you're right. You get this look on your face... *looks at Pearl's face* Yeah, that's the one.}}
{{TD|Pearl|What we need is a well thought out plan.}} 
{{TD||(''Pearl's gem starts to project a hologram, when Garnet interrupts.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|No. What we need is [[Sugilite]]. Amethyst, fuse with me.}}
{{TD|Amethyst & Pearl|WHAAAT?!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst begins to scream in excitement and Pearl looks annoyed.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Yeah! Let's mash it up! Bigger, badder, better! Ohohohohoho! *twirls around*}}
{{TD|Steven|Hold your horses! Are... you guys going to become a [[Fusion Gems|Gem Fusion]]?!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst replies excitedly with a scream. Steven joins in the screaming in excitement too.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|WAIT! *turns to Garnet* Garnet, think about this. You and Amethyst can be a little... eheh... unstable when your personalities combine. We need to be careful! Fuse with me instead.}}
{{TD|Garnet|*places her hand over Pearl's shoulder* We don't need to be careful. We just need to be huge.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Oh, yeah! Let's wreck this joint!}}
{{TD|Garnet|''[[Synchronize/Sugilite|Synchronize]]''.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet's [[gemstones]] begin to glow as she starts to dance.'')}}

{{TD||(''Garnet and Amethyst continues their fusion dance, fusing together and forming Sugilite.'')}}
{{TD|Sugilite|Hahahahaha! *laughs and cracks knuckles* I forgot how great it feels to be me!}}
{{TD|Steven|That's Sugilite?}}
{{TD|Sugilite|You got it, baby. Hey, Steven, wanna see something cool?}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah!}}
{{TD||(''Sugilite summons Garnet's gauntlets and Amethyst's whip, and fuses them together to form her [[Sugilite's Flail|flail]]. Steven gasps loudly in amazement.'')}}
{{TD|Sugilite|You like that, little man?}}
{{TD|Steven|Are you gonna smash stuff with your wrecking-ball-thingy?}}
{{TD|Sugilite|That's the plan! Where should I start?}}
{{TD|Steven|Do that one! *points to a nearby pillar*}}
{{TD||(''Sugilite proceeds to smash some pillars with her flails.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven, I think we should go.}}
{{TD|Steven|No way! This is awesome!}}
{{TD||(''Sugilite continues smashing more pillars, causing debris to fall everywhere.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Watch it!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl kicks away a debris heading towards her, but a small rock then hits Steven in the face, knocking him onto the ground'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| Steven! *yells at Sugilite* Ugh, you're just too much!}}
{{TD|Sugilite|Maybe you're just too little!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven, we're going! *picks Steven up*}}
{{TD|Steven|What? I'm fine! What about Sugilite?}}
{{TD|Pearl|She can find her own way home!}}
{{TD|Steven|Awww...}}
{{TD||(''Pearl and Steven warp away, just before a huge rock destroys the Warp Pad.'')}}

{{TD|[[Sadie]]|Whoa! Steven, what happened to you?}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh just a little battle damage from our last mission.}}
{{TD|Sadie|Really?}}
{{TD|[[Lars]]|Like what?}}
{{TD|Steven|I got hit by a rock!}}
{{TD||(''Steven lifts up his gauze, revealing a tiny cut on his forehead. Both Sadie and Lars starts laughing at Steven's "battle damage".'')}}
{{TD|Sadie|It must not have been a very big rock.}}
{{TD|Steven|*covers up the cut in embarrassment* Well, there's... internal bleeding. My hurt is on the inside!}}
{{TD|Sadie|*keeps laughing* Oh, okay!}}
{{TD|Lars|*keeps laughing* Toughen up, Steven!}}
{{TD|Steven|You're right. I'm soft. *takes his gauze off*}}
{{TD|Lars|If I weren't so modest, I'd whip out my sweet six-pack and... *struggles to open a can of sardines* ...show you what... a real man... looks like... *grunts*}}
{{TD||(''Sadie offers to open the can. Lars passes the can to her and she opens it with ease, returning it to Lars.'')}}
{{TD|Lars|Nah... I'm not gonna say thanks. *gets punched in the leg by Sadie* Aha... aha....}}
{{TD|Steven|That's it! We all need a workout! Let's do it! Let's workout together! *points to Sadie* You can beat up Lars! *turns to Lars* And you don't have to starve to death if Sadie divorces you!}}
{{TD|Lars|We're not married!}}

{{TD|Greg|Huh...? Wha? *wakes up from his nap*}}
{{TD|Steven|Hey, Dad!}}
{{TD|Greg|Hey, Steven, you like it? It's the best I can do on such short notice.}}
{{TD|Lars|*picks up a dumbbell made of cans, which quickly falls apart* No kidding.}}
{{TD|Greg|Well, I might join you kids show you how it's done. I've been slacking on my workout routine for few weeks... months... years... *coughs* Decades.}}
{{TD|Steven|Sure! The more the meatier! Oh! We'll need sweatbands!}}
{{TD||(''Steven runs up to the his house. Pearl then passes by the gym as Greg picks up a real dumbbell'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Hey, Pearl. Come to check out some buff studs?}}
{{TD|Pearl|No. *walks up to Steven's house* Steven, what on earth are you up to?}}
{{TD|Steven|We're starting a gym! *flexes* Imma get super strong! Like Sugilite!}}
{{TD|Pearl|You know, maybe this isn't a good idea.}}
{{TD|Steven|What? I wanna be strong so I can be useful to the team!}}
{{TD|Pearl|There are different ways of being strong.}}
{{TD|Steven|But I want to be strong in the real way. Come on, Pearl. *puts on a sweatband* Let's get beefy!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*pouts* I'd rather not. *enters the house*}}
{{TD||(''Pearl sighs as she closes the door behind. She then begins to sing "[[Strong in the Real Way]]".'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven...
<poem><i>Why do you have to look up to her
Aside from in a literal sense?
Don't you know that a power that big
Comes with a bigger expense?</i></poem>

{{TD||(''She picks up Steven's clothes on the floor.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|<poem><i>And can't you see that she's out of control
And overzealous?
I'm telling you for your own good,
And not because I'm...</i></poem>}}
{{TD||(''She sees everyone working out through the windows and pulls down the blinds in disapproval.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|<poem><i>I can show you how to be strong...
In the real way.
And I know that we can be strong
In the real way.
And I want to inspire you
I want to be your rock
And when I talk
It lights a fire in you</i></poem>}}
{{TD||(''All the while, Steven is peeking and eavesdropping on Pearl's song. Determined, Steven turns up the volume of his stereo and yells into his megaphone at the gym.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Who's ready to get buff? I don't wanna see your gut, I wanna see your guts!}}
{{TD||(''Steven sees Pearl looking at them from the porch, but she quickly looks away and goes back inside the house.'')}}

{{TD|Sadie|Hey, Steven, maybe um, you can work out a bit, too?}}
{{TD|Steven|Huh? I have been.}}
{{TD|Lars|We've been working out. You've just been singing some dumb song.}}
{{TD|Greg|But you're doing a great job pumping us up.}}
{{TD|Steven|Thanks, but I need to get strong, too. I'm switching to four-wheel drive! *puts four tires on his body and begins running around*}}
{{TD||[Time Skip â€” The next day at sunrise]}}
{{TD||(''Sadie, Lars, and Greg are all waiting outside the house for Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Sadie|Steven, come on! We're ready to get started! We can't work out without your mad coaching skills!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Steven's Room]}}
{{TD|Steven|*groans in pain* Be there in a sec! *struggles to get off of bed and down the stairs* So sore from getting ripped...}}
{{TD|Pearl|I don't understand. Amethyst and Garnet still aren't back yet. I tried to warp back to check on them, but the warp pad is down!}}
{{TD||(''Suddenly, the ground starts to shake and voices can be heard outside.'')}}
{{TD|Greg & Lars|What?!}}
{{TD|Sadie|Are you seeing this too?!}}
{{TD||(''The house starts to rumble and crumbles falls from the ceiling.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl & Steven|Wha-!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl and Steven quickly exit the house and see Sugilite in the distance, marching towards them in the ocean.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|What the hey is that?!}}
{{TD|Lars|*falls off from the makeshift monkey bars* Oohoomph!}}
{{TD||(''Sugilite arrives at the beach and everyone runs away in fear.'')}}
{{TD|Sugilite|*roars* I'm ''BORED!!!!!''}}
{{TD|Steven|It's Sugilite!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*approaches Sugilite* Y-you're back!}}
{{TD|Sugilite|You left me behind!}}
{{TD|Pearl|We just thought you didn't need any help. Now why don't you separate, and we can all sit down and relax?}}
{{TD|Sugilite|NO! *kicks Pearl*}}
{{TD|Steven|Pearl!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Listen to me! You've been fused for too long! You're losing yourselves!}}
{{TD|Sugilite|I am myself, and I'm sick of being split up! So you better get used to me, baby, and get this junk of my beach! *destroys the makeshift gym*}}
{{TD|Steven|*struggles over to Pearl* Why is she wrecking Dad's gym? Why is she attacking you?!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*lifts Steven up and tosses him away* Steven, get out of here!}}
{{TD|Steven|*lands stomach-down on the ground and is stuck limp* I can't move... *moans in pain*}}
{{TD||(''Pearl summons her spear and stances herself for battle.'')}}
{{TD|Sugilite|What, you wanna fight?!}}
{{TD|Pearl|You'll thank me ''later!''}}
{{TD||(''Pearl leaps towards Sugilite, but she is quickly swatted away.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Come on, kid! *helps Steven to get up*}}
{{TD|Steven|Dad, no! Pearl!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl stands back up and leaps off again, this time, managing to knock off Sugilite's visor.'')}}
{{TD|Steven & Greg|*gasp*}}
{{TD|Sugilite|You think you're something? You! *headbutts Pearl to the ground* Ain't! *hits Pearl into the sky* Nothing!!! *smacks Pearl into the ground from the sky*}}
{{TD||(''Sugilite then attempts to crush Pearl with her flail, but barely misses her. It also sends Steven and Greg flying some distance into the sand and damages Steven's house.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|My muscles!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven! Ugh... *kneels in pain and almost starts to cry* I'm sorry, Steven... Garnet, Amethyst... *sniffs* I wasn't strong enough to protect you. I'm not strong enough to do anything...}}
{{TD||(''Steven then sees the megaphone nearby and crawls towards it.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*using the megaphone* Come on, Pearl! Don't give up! I know you can take her down!}}
{{TD|Pearl|I can't...}}
{{TD|Steven|Yes, you can! Come on! You always knew what to do! You gotta show her what you showed me! That you're strong, Pearl! Strong in the real way!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl looks up at the [[Crystal Temple]] and, regaining some confidence, slowly pulls herself back on her feet.'')}}
{{TD|Sugilite|What?! You want some more?!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Anytime! You're no match for me! Not even close!}}
{{TD||(''Sugilite punches towards Pearl, which she dodges and then runs away. Sugilite then chases after Pearl up to the lighthouse on the cliff.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Go!}}
{{TD|Sugilite|Get back here!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl leaps off the cliff.'')}}
{{TD|Sugilite|*laughs* Nice try.}}
{{TD||(''Sugilite starts swinging her flail. Pearl then hurls her spear at the ground underneath Sugilite, causing her to lose her footing, fall off the cliff and crash onto the beach.'')}}
{{TD|Sugilite|Is that all you got? You think that's enough to be-}}
{{TD||(''Sugilite's flail lands smack on her head, separating her back into Garnet and Amethyst in a poof of purple cloud.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Amethyst, Garnet! Are you OK!?}}
{{TD|Garnet|*weakly* Yeah... Sugilite just overworked our bodies. It's... a little painful.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|And I've got a monster headache.}}
{{TD||(''Pearl pulls Garnet and Amethyst for a tearful hug. Garnet and Amethyst groan in pain as the sound of bone cracking is heard, causing Pearl to quickly release them.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Oh... *chuckles* Whoops.}}
{{TD|Steven|Pearl, you did it!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*panting* Thanks. You make a good coach.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Pearl, we should've listened... You were right.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Yeah. I was right.}}
{{TD|Steven|Go, Pearl!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Come on! I feel great! Who's up for a mission?! Or...}}
{{TD||(''Pearl continues shouting in the background, as two star irises zoom in on Garnet and Amethyst.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|How long is she going to keep this up?}}
{{TD|Garnet|We deserve it. Take it like a Gem.}}
{{TD|Lars|(''Another star iris pops over him and Sadie.'') Uh, what the heck just happened?}}
{{TD|Steven|(''Another star iris pops over him.'') ''Drop and give me 20!!!!!''}}
