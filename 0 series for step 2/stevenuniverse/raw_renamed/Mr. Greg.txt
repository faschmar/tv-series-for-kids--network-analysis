{{TD||(''Static flickers on the screen and a pre-recorded video begins to play. A [[Comet#Pepe's_Burgers_Jingle|variation]] of the song "[[Comet]]" is then heard, sung by a younger Marty.'')}}
{{TD|[[Marty]]| ♫ From the moment the meat hits the flame, / My stomach is growling without any shame! / And I know in my gut, / It's been worth the $5.95! / Would you like a burger? / From Pepe's Burgers? ♫}}
{{TD||(''A commercial style advertisement is played, featuring Pepe's Burgers and its burger meal at $5.95, with Marty being the face of the commercial, as he takes a bite out of a burger and winks to the audience. Steven, joined by Greg and Pearl, watches in awe as the commercial concludes on the TV inside Greg's van, parked outside the [[Crystal Temple]].'')}}
{{TD|[[Steven]]| Whoa! Your song is on TV!}}
{{TD|[[Greg]]| Yeah. Apparently, Marty sold my song as a burger jingle, and now I'm filthy stinking rich. *holds out the check slip Marty gave him*}}
{{TD|Steven| *sighs* The sweet stench of success.}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]| *leans towards the TV curiously* What is this?}}
{{TD|Greg| You know when [[Rose Quartz|Rose]] came to my concert? The night we met? I was playing this song!}}
{{TD|Pearl| ''This'' is what did it? Burgers?}}
{{TD|Greg| It wasn't about burgers back then. She probably would've like this, though, right?}}
{{TD|Pearl| *sighs* She would have loved it. *walks away, looking upset*}}
{{TD||(''Greg groans in discontent as he turns off the TV.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| So, what are you gonna do with all the money?}}
{{TD|Greg| I don't know.}}
{{TD||(''Greg climbs into the back of his van and grabs his [[Greg's_Guitar|guitar]]. Steven sit next to him, and Greg begins to sing "[[Don't Cost Nothing]]'" with him.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| ♫ Bright sunny day, don't cost nothing. / Light summer breeze, don't cost nothing. / What do I do, with all this money? / When the only thing I want is you? ♫}}
{{TD||(''Steven shrugs.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| ♫ Palling around, don't cost nothing. / Singing a song, don't cost nothing. / How do I spend, all this money? I'd rather just spend time with you. ♫}}
{{TD|Steven| ♫ You could buy a house, and a car. ♫}}
{{TD|Greg| ♫ I guess that I can, but I've already got a van. / I could put you through college. ♫}}
{{TD|Steven| But I'm with the Gems all the time?}}
{{TD|Greg| ♫ Or I could buy you all the finest courses online. ♫}}
{{TD|Steven| ♫ What if we took a trip? ♫}}
{{TD|Greg| Do you think?}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah, I do! ♫ We could take a vacation. ♫ We could go somewhere new.}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Greg begins to ponder, when Greg has an idea and begins rummaging inside his van. The song then transitions to a more upbeat one: "[[Empire City (song)|Empire City]]".)}}
{{TD|Greg| ♫ I know a place that's always exciting! / The show and the sights and the lights that are blinding! / [[Empire City]]! I'm talkin' Empire City! ♫}}
{{TD||(''Greg pulls out a postcard illustrating the city of Empire City.)}}
{{TD|Greg| The streets and the sounds and the buildings towering! / Subways that run from Brooklyn to the Bowery! / Empire City! Let's go to Empire City!}}

(Empire City!) ♫ }}
{{TD||(''A spotlight shine upon Greg and Steven as the words "Empire City" appear above them in neon lights.)}}
{{TD|Steven| ♫ And let's bring Pearl! ♫}}
{{TD||(''Another spotlight shine on Pearl, her name in neon lights appears above her, as the song ends.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| What!?}}
{{TD|Pearl| ... I don't know. Past experiences have taught me that three is a crowd.}}
{{TD|Greg| *whispers to Steven* Steven, me and Pearl haven't gotten along that well since, uh... Well, since I started dating your mother. *glances at the painting of Rose in the house*}}
{{TD|Steven| Aw, come on! We're all a big family. It'll be great. Just you, me, Pearl, and don't forget Mom.}}
{{TD||(''Steven pulls up his shirt to reveal his gem. Greg and Pearl gasp and stare at each other, in response to the awkward situation.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Empire City]}}
{{TD||(''An orchestral fanfare is heard as Greg drives Steven and Pearl into Empire City in his van. He parks outside a hotel called [[Le Hotel]] and the trio enters it. Greg goes to the counter and rings the bell. The desk clerk, Ricky, glances at Greg, seemingly unamused by his appearance, until Greg hands him a card, reading "Mr Greg: Bazzzillionaire". Steven then appears and puts a stack of [[Currency|money]] on the counter. Ricky's eyes widen in sheer surprise and he, along with several hotel employees suddenly popping in, begins to sing "[[Mr. Greg (song)|Mr. Greg]]" in his honor.'')}}
{{TD|Ricky| ♫ Hey, shake a leg! ♫}}
{{TD|Hotel Employees| ♫ Hey, shake a leg! ♫}}
{{TD|Ricky| ♫ It's Mr. Greg! ♫}}

{{TD|Ricky| ♫ And he's here to spend his dough all over the town! ♫}}
{{TD||(''The hotel employees carry Greg, Steven and Pearl over their heads and bring them to a fancy restaurant, seating them down at a table.'')}}

{{TD|Greg| ♫ I've got the bucks! ♫}}
{{TD|Hotel Employees| ♫ It's all deluxe. ♫}}
{{TD|Greg| ♫ It's all deluxe! / When you're dining out with me, it's the finest steak and brie. / And if I break a table, it ain't no- Whoa!}}
{{TD||(''Greg dances on the table, but accidentally slips off and breaks it. The concerned Ricky pops in and Greg hands him a currency note.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| Just bill it to my bank.}}
{{TD|Ricky| A hundred bucks?! ♫ Gee, thanks! ♫}}
{{TD||(''The hotel employees then carry Greg, Steven and Pearl into the elevator and up to the hotel penthouse. Steven and Greg get changed into fine tuxedos with top hats and begin having fun in the penthouse's pool. Pearl does not seem to enjoy herself though, and Greg and Steven glare at her. They then grin again, as Pearl get changed into a tuxedo and top hat as well.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| ♫ I must admit... ♫}}
{{TD|Steven & Greg| ♫ You must admit. ♫}}
{{TD|Pearl| ♫ It's a perfect fit! ♫}}
{{TD|Steven & Greg| ♫ You look great in it!. ♫}}
{{TD|Pearl| ♫ And those fountains I found wasteful, are actually quite tasteful. / This city's got its charm, unlike that termite-ridden [[The Barn|barn]]. / And any time with Steven makes for a delightful evenin'! ♫}}
{{TD||(''Pearl begins tap-dancing with Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| ♫ You're having fun! ♫}}
{{TD|Pearl| ♫ More or less. ♫}}
{{TD|Greg| ♫ So dance with me! Just say-}}
{{TD|Pearl| ''NO!''}}
{{TD||(''Greg tries to dance with Pearl, but Pearl immediately pulls herself away in revulsion, abruptly ending the song.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| I... I mean... *sighs* Maybe later... *walks away sulking*}}
{{TD|Hotel Employee| Boo! You ruined the song!}}
{{TD|Greg| *holds out a handful of cash* Sorry, guys. Thanks for singing with us. }}
{{TD||(''Steven looks at Pearl in dismay, as she stands in front of the windows.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| Don't worry about it, kiddo. It's always been this way.}}
{{TD||(''Steven keeps looking at Pearl sadly as the hotel employees begin to leave.'')}}
{{TD||[Time Skip]}}
{{TD||(''Pearl walks in to look around the penthouse, now unlit and in a messy state from Greg and Steven's activities. She then enters the bedroom, where Steven and Greg are fast asleep on a king-sized bed. Pearl walks over to glance down at the snoring duo and sighs deeply.

{{TD|Pearl| ♫ I was fine with the men, / Who would come into her life now and again. / I was fine 'cause I knew, / That they didn't really matter, until you. ♫}}
{{TD||(''Pearl pulls out a single rose from the banquet and puts on her top hat. She then walks out onto the balcony, when Steven is waken up by Pearl's song.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| ♫ I was fine when you came, / And we fought like it was all some silly game. / Over her, who she'd chose. / After all those years, I never thought I'd lose. ♫}}
{{TD||(''Pearl dances on the balcony and leans against the glass edge of the balcony. She then lets her hat roll down her arm and catches it in his hand.'')}}

{{TD||(''Pearl begins jousting, using the rose like a sword, and dancing on top of the railing. She then lays on her back on the railings, gazing up and reaching out to the sky.'')}}

{{TD|Pearl| ... I shouldn't have come along.}}
{{TD|Steven| No. This is exactly why I brought you.}}

{{TD||(''Greg is seen sorrowfully indulging himself with cherries out of a cup, as serene piano music plays in the background.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| *sighs* Cherry man.}}
{{TD||(''Greg eats a cherry and throws the stem into the cup. Steven clears his throat from behind Greg and he turns around, seeing Steven holding hands with Pearl, smiling awkwardly. Greg gets up from his seat and Steven prompts him and Pearl to make up. Greg and Pearl look away from each other uncomfortably, when the piano music suddenly and inappropriately transitions into upbeat ragtime. Steven walks up to the pianist and offers him a bundle of cash. The pianist gleefully accepts the cash, singing to himself, and walks away. Steven then takes over the piano, cracks his knuckles, and begins to sing "[[Both of You]]".'')}}
{{TD|Steven| ♫ Why don't you talk to each other? / Why don't you talk to each other? Just give it a try. / Why don't you talk about what happened? / I know you're trying to avoid it, but I don't know why. ♫}}

{{TD||(''Spotlights shine upon the trio, as Greg and Pearl slide closer to one another. Greg turns into a shade of yellow, and Pearl into a shade of blue.

{{TD|Greg| Look, if I were you, I'd hate me too.}}
{{TD|Pearl| I don't hate you.}}
{{TD|Greg| But I knew how you felt about Rose, and I stayed anyway.}}

{{TD|Greg| Then, what was?}}
{{TD|Pearl| She fell in love with ''you''.}}

{{TD||(''Steven concludes his song while Greg and Pearl conclude their dance, smiling at each other, and the hotel employees pop out from behind tables to cheer on the trio. Greg and Pearl then laughs together when Ricky runs over to Greg, holding a covered platter in hand.'')}}
