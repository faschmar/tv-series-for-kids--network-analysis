{{TD||[Open Ext. [[It's a Wash]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven is sitting on a chair outside of the car wash, reading his own texts while texting on his [[Steven's Phone|phone]].'')}}
{{TD|[[Steven]]|"Hey, [[Connie Maheswaran|Connie]]. How are you today?" "Hope everything's going okay." "It'd be cool if you told me it was..." "I guess I miss you." "I know yesterday I said, "I guess" but I mean," "I do miss you..." "Hope you didn't get your phone mixed up with a tennis ball. Ha ha." A tennis ball? ''Really'', Universe?! *sighs*}}
{{TD|[[Greg]]|Help! Ah! Yah! Back!}}
{{TD||(''Greg is then seen struggling to remove a water hose that is tangled around himself.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Ugh! Hey, uh, Steve-aroni, ughh, want to help your old Pa over here?}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh, yeah, Dad, one sec.}}
{{TD||(''Steven reluctantly sends a final text to Connie, reading "Please talk to me."'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Sorry. Sorry. I'm on it.}}
{{TD||(''Steven runs up to Greg and bites off a piece of the hose, freeing Greg.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*grunts* Are you good? Are you safe? Do you still love me?}}
{{TD|Greg|Yeah, of- of course, buddy. It's just some hoses. I can buy new ones. I still have like... [[Drop Beat Dad|9 million dollars]] left, and what better way to spend that than on some hoses, right, kiddo?}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah, Dad.}}
{{TD||(''Steven's cellphone vibrates and gasps in shock. He holds out his phone and reluctantly checks it, only to see a text from Ronaldo.'')}}
{{TD|[[Ronaldo Fryman|Ronaldo]] (Voiceover)|"STEVEEEN! So. Did you ever get around to watching the "[[Minor_Objects/Media#Koala_Princess|Koala Princess]]" box set I lent you three months ago?"}}
{{TD||(''Steven sighs in dismay.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Hey, is... everything okay? You're looking a little glum.}}
{{TD|Steven|I am a little glum.}}
{{TD|Greg|Do you want to talk about it?}}
{{TD|Steven|Umm... It's just... space lag... from when I went to space. *walks off*}}
{{TD|Greg|Hmm...}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. [[Beach House]]]}}
{{TD||(''Back home, Steven is absentmindedly wiping a plate with a soap bottle, still sighing in disappointment, when his cellphone starts vibrating again.''}}
{{TD|Steven|Ah! *throws the plate and soap bottle away in surprise* Waahh!}}
{{TD||(''Steven reaches for his phone but then pauses himself.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Wait. No. I need to play it cool.}}
{{TD||(''Steven casually flips over his phone and eagerly checks his phone screen.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo (Voiceover)|"I'm just gonna assume by your silence that you're entangled within the immersive koala lore of the show." "Did you get to the part where Koala Princess and Kanga-Roofus kiss?"}}
{{TD||(''Disappointed, Steven puts down his phone, when he hears Greg's voice from outside.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Steven, you want to help us with these... groceries?}}
{{TD|Steven|Coming.}}
{{TD||(''Greg and the [[Crystal Gems]] walk in,each carrying some groceries.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Eh? Eh?}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]|*muffled( Check this out, Steven. *spits out an egg, with normal voice again* It's farm fresh.}}
{{TD|Steven|Uhh... Thanks guys, but the fridge is full.}}
{{TD|Greg|Not the fridge at our ''vacation house!''}}
{{TD||(''Greg pulls a confetti popper as the Gems clap and cheer.'')}}
{{TD|The Gems|Whoo! Vacation!}}
{{TD|Greg|I thought, "Why spend money on hoses when I can spend it on ''houses''?" So I found a place we could rent for the weekend by searching online.}}
{{TD||(''Greg holds up his phone, displaying an image of their vacation house with a four star rating.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Back in the old days, we just went door-to-door hoping one was unlocked. But, this is the new days!}}
{{TD|Steven|Okay. Well, have fun.}}
{{TD|Greg|Uh, Steven, you're going on vacation, too. *coughs and glances at Pearl*}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]|Oh, yes. This is the perfect time for a vacation- I mean, how often are we on the same planet together?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Yeah. And you'll be with your favorite [[Gems]], and your favorite dad.}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]|Agree with Amethyst. Turn to Steven. Steven, you should go. No, with more enthusiasm. Steven, it's a vacation! *gives a thumbs-up*}}
{{TD|Steven|I mean, I would, but I'm really tied up with something important.}}
{{TD||(''Steven checks his phone again, as more texts keep appearing from Ronaldo.'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo (Voiceover)|"In the end, the wombats were for naught." "But it really makes you think-"}}
{{TD|Steven|I'll go.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Aced it!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[Cool Ranch]]]}}
{{TD||(''Greg drives Steven and the Gems in [[Greg's Van|his van]] up to the front of their vacation house, while Steven's eyes is fixated onto his phone.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Here it is, temporary home sweet temporary home.}}
{{TD||(''Everyone gets out and begins unloading the van; Steven observes Garnet and Amethyst carrying a mattress in the house.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Is that my bed?}}
{{TD|Greg|Yeah. I want you to be as comfortable as possible, finally have some family time. I feel... like you haven't had that in a while.}}
{{TD|Steven|*looking down at his phone* Yeah, maybe.}}
{{TD|Greg|This place is great! They have one of those refrigerators that dispense water, not to mention four windows, and an analog clock!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*reading off a piece of memo* Hmm, says here we can't use the water dispenser or the clock. Windows must be kept closed at all times, and remove all shoes before entering. Hmm.}}
{{TD||(''Pearl notices a pair of shoes outside the house. She picks them up and throws them away, before walking inside the house. Amethyst then peeks out through the doorway.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Hey, Greg, did you invite anyone else? Party guy, about three feet long, hissing, reptilian?}}
{{TD|Greg|No...?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Well... You might want to factor in a plus-one.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Oh! Party guy! No!}}
{{TD||(''Hissing and clashing noises are heard from within the house.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|I promise. It's gonna be a really good time.}}
{{TD|Steven|*keeps looking down at his phone* It's a great place, Dad.}}
{{TD||[Time-Skip; Dusk]}}
{{TD||(''Steven, Greg, and the Gems are gathered outside, lounging and barbecuing.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|It only bit Pearl once, but, like, we're Gems. She'll be okay.}}
{{TD|Pearl|*groans* It isn't the pain. It's the ''surprise''.}}
{{TD||(''Greg and Amethyst glance over to Steven, who is still engrossed on his phone.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Hey, Amethyst, do you think you could...}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Yeah! *walks over and sits down beside Steven* Hey, Steven.}}
{{TD|Steven|Hi, Amethyst.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Man, you can see the stars so clearly out here. It's pretty, huh?}}
{{TD|Steven|Huh? Uh, I don't know. *shrugs* It's... okay.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Hey, hey. It's okay, if it ''isn't'' okay.}}
{{TD|Steven|The sky?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Yeah.}}
{{TD|Steven|What?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*shrugs* I don't know. So, uh, you really into phones now?}}
{{TD|Steven|No.}}
{{TD||(''Steven nervously puts his phone away. Amethyst looks at Greg and shrugs.'')}}
{{TD||[Time-Skip; Night-time]}}
{{TD||(''Still staring at his phone, Steven bumps into the door inside the house, and opens it to walk outside, when Greg and Garnet, sitting in a hot tub, greet him.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Hey, Schtu-ball! Won't you take my place? I've been in here way too long. I'm gonna become a raisin.}}
{{TD||(''Greg winks at Garnet before climbing out and walking away.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven, you should join me. Become a raisin.}}
{{TD|Steven|Okay, but one sec.}}
{{TD||(''Steven walks away and returns with his phone in a ziplock bag, and climbs into the tub with his clothes still on.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven, I know what's troubling you.}}
{{TD|Steven|You do? *smiles in a sense of relief* Gosh. I really messed up, didn't I?}}
{{TD|Garnet|You didn't do anything wrong. [[Pink Diamond]] was a villain.}}
{{TD||(''Steven's relief quickly fades, as Garnet attempts to weave another epic tale, cuing a flashback of the Crystal Gems facing off a massive Gem, presumably Pink Diamond.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|It was 5,750 years ago. Pink Diamond was ravishing the planet-}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah, I know.}}
{{TD||(''The flashback abruptly ends.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Oh.}}
{{TD|Steven|Pink Diamond was bad. Everything bad had to happen so good things could kind of happen.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Uh, good. You understand.}}
{{TD||[Time-Skip; The Next Day]}}
{{TD||(''Steven is rocking back and forth on a chair outside the house, still fixated on his phone.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Buzz. Buzz. At least wiggle a little.}}
{{TD|Greg|Come on. Can't you give it another shot?}}
{{TD||(''Overhearing the others inside the house, Steven approaches the door and peeks inside.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|What are we supposed to do? He just doesn't want to talk about it.}}
{{TD|Greg|But... I know it's not space lag. This is some Gem thing he knows I won't understand. I don't know anything about [[Gem Homeworld|Homeworld]]. I don't know anything about your society. Whatever horrible things he saw out there, you guys have to put it into context.}}
{{TD|Garnet|If Steven won't talk to us, then the help we can give him is limited. We've all tried to coax it out of him, except for... *turns to Pearl*}}
{{TD|Pearl|Me? But I have no idea what Homeworld is like now.}}
{{TD|Greg|Pearl, please.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|He knows you know about space stuff.}}
{{TD|Garnet|It can't hurt to try.}}
{{TD||(''Pearl walks toward the door, prompting Steven to quickly move away.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Mmm!}}
{{TD||(''Steven sits down on the porch, pretending to stare at his phone, as Pearl steps outside.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Heh, it sure is quiet out here, huh?}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah.}}
{{TD|Pearl|So... Homeworld... I always hoped you'd see it some day, but I thought I'd be there with you. Being taken there... as a prisoner, I suppose it was something of a... traumatic experience...?}}
{{TD||(''Pearl glances down at Steven, still on his phone.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|It's just... *sits down*next to Steven* Steven, I'm sure you have a lot of questions you'd like answers to, like about [[The Great Diamond Authority|the Diamonds]], for instance? There are things that are... ''impossible'' for me to explain. But I want to. I-}}
{{TD||(''Pearl almost instantly, seemingly involuntarily, covers her mouth before she can speak, as Steven grows increasingly distressed. Pearl tries to pull her hand off her hands with her other hand.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven, I- *covers mouth again and doubles over*}}
{{TD|Steven|''Connie hates me!''}}
{{TD|Pearl|... Wha?}}
{{TD||(''Greg, Garnet, and Amethyst suddenly burst through the door.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|We weren't listening.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Also continue, Steven.}}
{{TD|Steven|I'm not upset about what happened on Homeworld although, yeah, a lot of that was really messed up. But my relationship with Connie is even more messed up. I left her behind to go to Homeworld after promising we'd face everything together. I'm sure I really hurt her. I've been calling and texting her for a week, but she hasn't responded once. *tears up* Connie might never talk to me again.}}
{{TD||(''Steven runs away crying.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|Steven!}}
{{TD|Greg|I'll go get him. I don't know anything about Homeworld, but I know about this.}}
{{TD||(''Greg begins searching for Steven, who is seen cowering behind a pair of  barrels.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Steven? Steven?}}
{{TD|Steven|Steven's not here.}}
{{TD|Greg|Oh, that's too bad. So, I guess I'll just talk to this Steven-shaped barrel instead.}}
{{TD|Steven|If you must.}}
{{TD|Greg|Schtu-ball, if this was about Connie, why didn't you say anything sooner?}}
{{TD|Steven|I was... embarra... *hesitates to continue*}}
{{TD|Greg|You were... embroidered? Embroiled? Emboldened to talk to your old man about your problems?}}
{{TD|Steven|I was ''embarrassed'', okay!? You and the Gems all like Connie, and I was worried that if you heard what happened then... You'd be mad at me too.}}
{{TD|Greg|Oh, Steven, of course we're not mad. And I'm sure Connie's not mad, either. Well, at least I'm sure she doesn't ''hate'' you. That whole handing-yourself-over-to-Homeworld thing was definitely a high-stress situation. It really scared all of us. I'm not exactly over it either, but I guess carting you off to the middle of nowhere to spend time with you is my way of dealing with it. Maybe having some distance from you is Connie's way.}}
{{TD|Steven|But the last thing I did was send her a bunch of dumb texts. I made some weird joke about tennis, and I don't even know if it makes sense, an-}}
{{TD|Greg|Tennis?}}
{{TD|Steven|*hands Greg his phone* See? No wonder she hasn't responded.}}
{{TD|Greg|Uhh, Steven? You don't get any service out here.}}
{{TD|Steven|...''What'' are you even telling me? Maybe she's been trying to get in touch with me this whole time, and I haven't seen it! What if she thinks I'm ignoring her? Dad! We have to find cell service.}}
{{TD|Greg|Right!}}
{{TD||[Time-Skip; Dusk]}}
{{TD||(''Steven gets into Greg's van and signals the Gems to get in.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Go, go, go!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Okay.}}
{{TD||(''Steven buckles his seat belt and holds out his phone.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Floor it!}}
{{TD||(''Greg steps on the accelerator panel and begins driving away from Cool Ranch.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|How we doing?}}
{{TD|Steven|*observing the signal bars on his phone* Take a right!}}
{{TD||(''Greg turns the van right, driving it off-road.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Nah, back up. No, wait! Keep going!}}
{{TD||(''The signal begins to improve.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|We're heading for a cliff, buddy.}}
{{TD|Steven|Just a little further.}}
{{TD|Greg|Gonna have to stop soon.}}
{{TD|Steven|Almost got it!}}
{{TD|Greg|Ahh!}}
{{TD||(''Greg stops the van just before the edge of the cliff. He sighs in  relief as Steven climbs onto the roof of the van.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Come on. Come on. Come on. (''Steven's phone finally receives full reception.'') Yes! We've got service!}}
{{TD||(''A new message pops up on Steven's phone and Steven gasps in surprise. He opens it only to find...'')}}
{{TD|Ronaldo (Voiceover)|"Steven! When I didn't hear back from you, I was sure a nefarious plot was afoot-"}}
{{TD|Greg|*peeks up at the roof of the van* Well?}}
{{TD|Steven|*disappointed* ...No. No messages from Connie.}}
{{TD||(''Greg climbs up onto the roof and sits down beside Steven, who quickly falls over onto Greg's lap in remorse.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Aww. You'll get through this, buddy. I know it hurts now, but... give it time.}}
{{TD|Steven|I know. I need to let it go.}}
{{TD||(''The Gems then peeks up at the roof too.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Got room for three more?}}
{{TD|Steven|Always.}}
{{TD||(''The Gems climb atop and join Steven and Greg on the roof.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Nice night, isn't it?}}
{{TD|Steven|...Yeah.}}
