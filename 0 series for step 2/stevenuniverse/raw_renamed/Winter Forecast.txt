{{TD||[Open int. [[Beach House]]]}}
{{TD||(''[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] and [[Connie Maheswaran|Connie]] are sitting by the fireplace, while Steven is roasting marshmallows on a stick.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Mmm... You're roasting good! *withdraws a roasted marshmallow away from the fire* And... *blows at the marshmallow and eats it*}}
{{TD|Connie| Good job not setting that one on fire.}}
{{TD|Steven| Mm-hmm. What is it about marshmallows that make them so... good?}}
{{TD|Connie| It's probably the animal by-product.}}
{{TD|Steven| *slightly disgusted* You mean like... ''poop''?}}
{{TD|Connie| *picks up a marshmallow* No. Stuff like hooves, bone marrow, collagen... *eats it* and lots of sugar and corn syrup.}}
{{TD|Steven| *yells* Corn Sugar!}}
{{TD|Connie| *yells* Sugar syrup! *shoves a handful of marshmallows into her mouth* Mmm! Bone marrow!}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie laugh together, when Connie's cellphone rings.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| *picks up the phone* Hello?}}
{{TD|[[Priyanka Maheswaran|Dr. Maheswaran]]| *over the phone phone* Have you been watching World Weather News?}}
{{TD|Connie| Um... no. *swallows the marshmallows in her mouth* Steven's still grounded from watching TV.}}
{{TD|Dr. Maheswaran| I see. Well, there's a snowstorm on its way to [[Beach City]], and I don't want you getting snowed in. You need to get a ride home this instant. Otherwise [[Mr. Maheswaran|your father]] is gonna try to pick you up.}}
{{TD|Connie| *gets worried* Oh no. Don't send Dad. I'll be home soon. *hangs up her phone* Looks like I gotta get going.}}
{{TD|Steven| *mouth full of marshmallows* Oh, no...}}
{{TD|Connie| There's a snowstorm coming through, and my parents don't want me getting stuck here.}}
{{TD|Steven| *swallows his marshmallows* Man! That stinks!}}
{{TD|Connie| *sighs* Wouldn't it be fun if we got snowed in together?}}
{{TD|Steven| *gasps* We could stay up all night and watch the snow fall!}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie smile at each other. The [[Crystal Gems|Gem]] then walks into the house from the [[Crystal Temple]].'')}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]| Hello, you two.}}
{{TD|Steven & Connie| Hi, Garnet.}}
{{TD|[[Pearl]]| You all having a nice time?}}
{{TD|Steven| *walks over with Connie* Yeah, but Connie has to go soon. There's a snowstorm-a-comin'.}}
{{TD|Connie| Maybe the storm will miss us. Sometimes the forecast is completely wrong.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Nope. It's definitely going to snow.}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]| *makes a rap gesture* That's the 411, yo.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Trust.}}
{{TD|Steven| *gasps and whispers to Connie* Garnet has future vision.}}
{{TD|Garnet| You kids better get yourselves to [[Greg Universe|Greg's]].}}
{{TD|Steven| Wait! We can't go yet. *turns to Connie* I've got to show you this [[TubeTube]] video really quick.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Steven.}}
{{TD|Steven| It's only, like, one minute long.}}
{{TD|Garnet| *walks over and kneels in front of Steven* I know you don't want to go, but you have to make the right choice. *kisses him on the forehead* Mwah!}}
{{TD|Steven| *blushes and giggles, holding his forehead* That tickles!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[It's A Wash]]]}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie arrive at Greg's car wash, when it begins to snow.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| *watching the snow fall* Wow! *gets pelted in the head by a snowball* Aah!}}
{{TD|Connie| *laughs* Gotcha, Steven!}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie laugh together as Steven wipes the snowball off his head.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| Come on, kids. We got to go if we're gonna beat the storm. I'll start [[Greg's Van|the van]]. *twirls his car keys* ♫ Carabeena~ Carabeena~ ♫}}
{{TD|Steven| Aw, do we got to go?}}
{{TD|Greg| Yes. The Maheswarans think I'm a responsible parent, and I've ''got'' to maintain that image.}}
{{TD|Connie| *sighs* Guess this is it.}}
{{TD|Steven| Well, Dad. *grabs Connie and smushes a snowball into her face, causing her to giggle* If you want to look responsible, you should probably change out of that sweatsuit.}}
{{TD|Greg| But it's cherries. Everybody likes cherries. I'm a cherry man! *pauses* Okay, I see your point. Just give me a second to change. *walks to the back of his van*}}
{{TD|Connie| *whispering* Steven, are you procrastinating?}}
{{TD|Steven| *whispers back* Nah. I'm just killing time.}}
{{TD|Greg| *rummages through a clothing pile in the back of his van and pulls out a dark green turtleneck sweater* Aha! You can practically smell the responsibility.}}
{{TD|Steven| Isn't that the turtleneck you wore the [[Fusion Cuisine|first time you met them]]? They're gonna think you only have one fancy shirt.}}
{{TD|Greg| ... I ''do'' only have one fancy shirt.}}
{{TD|Steven| Don't worry, Dad. We'll help you find the perfect, most responsible outfit.}}
{{TD|Greg| I don't know. I haven't worn any of this stuff in years.}}
{{TD||(''Time passes by as Greg trying on various outfits, while Steven and Connie goof around in the snow. Whenever Greg comes out of the van with a new outfit, Steven and Connie stop playing and shake their heads in disagreement, forcing Greg back into the van to change. He eventually comes out of the van wearing a disco outfit.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| Okay, how about this one?}}
{{TD|Steven| ... I can't lie. That is the best outfit I've ever seen.}}
{{TD|Greg| Okay-great-let's-go!}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie get into the van and Greg starts driving off. The group watch as snow begins to cover the windshield.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| Holy moly! *turns on the car heater and windshield wipers* That snow is really coming down!}}
{{TD||(''The van rolls over a patch of ice, causing it to skid wildly on the road. The group starts screaming as the van spins out of control and the snow constantly covers the windshield, despite the wipers. The van eventually crashes into a snowbank on the side of the road. The group quickly catch their breath.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| W-what are we gonna do?}}
{{TD|Greg| Uhh... I guess we'll have to walk.}}
{{TD|Steven & Connie| WHAT?!}}
{{TD|Greg| A responsible parent doesn't let two kids strand themselves in a van in the middle of nowhere.}}
{{TD||(''The group starts treading through the thick snow and strong snowstorm.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| *strained yelling* A responsible parent escorts those kids through wind, sleet, and snow to avoid making the other parent angry!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[Maheswaran Residence|Connie's house]]]}}
{{TD||(''The group eventually arrive at Connie's house. They rapidly knock on the door and ring the doorbell till Dr. and Mr. Maheswaran open the door, greeting a violently shivering Greg, Steven, and Connie.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| H-hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.}}
{{TD|Steven| H-hello, Dr. and Mr. Maheswaran.}}
{{TD|Greg| Sorry we're late.}}
{{TD||(''Connie's parents stare blankly as Steven, Connie and Greg step into the house.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| Mom, Dad... *chuckles nervously* ... You remember Mr. Universe and Ste—}}
{{TD|Dr. Maheswaran| *yells* Do you have ''any'' idea what time it is?!}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| *yells* Why are the children blue?!}}
{{TD|Dr. Maheswaran| What are you do— (''Connie lets out a single sneeze and looks at her mom nervously.'') ... She's sick! *grabs Connie by the arm* You're going straight to bed, young lady! *drags her away* That's the last time I let you out during flu season.}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| *crosses his arms* I think you know where the door is. Since you're... standing in it.}}
{{TD|Greg| Uhh, I kind of crashed my ride.}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| Are you serious?!}}
{{TD|Greg| *timidly* Yes... ?}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| *groans* I'll go set up the pull-out couch. *walks away*}}
{{TD|Greg| Uhh... okay. So much for being responsible. *starts stroking and squeezing his hair dry* Maybe I should have worn the floral print.}}
{{TD||(''Steven stares ahead intently and gazes upon the trippy blue pattern on the back of Greg's disco outfit. Slowly, the blue pattern morphs into hypnotizing swirls, as Steven begins to sweat nervously and holds his head in anxiety.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Greg's van, earlier that day]}}
{{TD||(''The tires screech as the van crashes again. Steven slowly wakes up as Connie and Greg catch their breath.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| Is everyone okay?}}
{{TD|Connie| Yeah.}}
{{TD|Steven| *looks around, dazed* W-wait... What— W-what happened?}}
{{TD|Greg| We wiped out.}}
{{TD|Steven| No, I mean, why are we in the van?}}
{{TD|Greg| You're right. We gotta get out there and start walking if we wanna get Connie home.}}
{{TD|Steven| Dad! No! We should stay put. It'll be way safer this way.}}
{{TD|Connie| My parents ''are'' all about safety.}}
{{TD|Greg| Heh. They can't argue with safety.}}
{{TD|Steven| It'll be like camping!}}
{{TD|Connie| But in cozy bucket seats!}}
{{TD||(''Time passes by as the van slowly becomes more and more covered in the snowstorm. Greg cracks an egg over a waffle maker in the back of the van, and it sizzles as it cooks.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| Thanks for dinner, Mr. Universe. Itadakimasu! *begins to eat an egg waffle*}}
{{TD|Steven| *grabs Greg's nearby [[Greg's Guitar|guitar]] and begins to strum* Any requests?}}
{{TD|Connie| Hmm. Let's hear a song about... a snack monster! That loves... animal by-products! Om-nom-nom! (''Connie shoves her whole waffle into her mouth, causing Steven to laugh, when her cellphone begins to ring again. She then picks it up.'') Hello?}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| Connie, are you still at Steven Universe's house? I'm on my way.}}
{{TD|Connie| Dad, no! You know how bad you are at driving in the snow! It's way too rough out here!}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| I'm almost at Beach City, so start putting on your shoes.}}
{{TD||(''Greg and Steven return back to their seats and turns back on the windshield wipers.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| I see some headlights. Is that him?}}
{{TD||(''An engine revs as Mr. Maheswaran's car pulls around the corner.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| Don't worry. I got it this time. Oh, wait. (''The car begins to swerve a bit.'') Ooh! Aaaaah!}}
{{TD|Connie| Dad, stop the car! You're right in front of us!}}
{{TD|| *horn blaring*}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| I-I got it! I got it! I— (''The car begins to swerve in circles, mere feet from the parked van.'') Ooh! Aah! I- I don't got it! (''The car picks up speed, heading right for the van.'') I don't have ''anything''!}}
{{TD||(''Mr. Maheswaran's car smashes into the van, and the hypnotizing blue swirls Steven previously saw makes a reappearance.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. It's A Wash!, earlier that day]}}
{{TD||(''Steven gets hit in the head by a snowball and screams in panic. He turns around and glares around Connie.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| Woah. Sorry, Steven. Are you okay?}}
{{TD|Steven| Connie, what's going on?! Everything keeps repeating!}}
{{TD|Greg| Hey, come on, kids. We got to go if we're gonna beat the storm. I'll start the van. *twirls his car keys* ♫ Carabeena~ Carabeena~ ♫}}
{{TD||(''Steven snatches Greg's car keys.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Hey! What the—??}}
{{TD||(''Steven tosses them into a nearby snowbank.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| My keys! I'm not gonna find those till spring!}}
{{TD|Steven| *grabs Connie's arm and begins to pull her away* Come on, Connie!}}
{{TD|Connie| What?}}
{{TD|Greg| Hey!}}
{{TD|Steven| Let's go back to my place.}}
{{TD|Connie| But my parents—}}
{{TD|Steven| *abruptly stops and grabs onto Connie's shoulders* No, Connie! You have to listen to me! If we leave Beach City, bad things are gonna happen! I've seen it! Bad things! ''Several'' bad things! *glares at her intently*}}
{{TD|Connie| Um... okay. Let me just call my mom and tell her.}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie are still running towards Steven's home.'')}}
{{TD|Connie| Mom, this is Connie. I'm staying at Steven's overnight.}}
{{TD|Dr. Maheswaran| Oh, no, you're not, young lady!}}
{{TD|Connie| But... Mom!}}
{{TD|Dr. Maheswaran| You're coming home right now!}}
{{TD|Steven| *snatches Connie's phone* Dr. Maheswaran, you can't let your husband leave the house! He can't drive in the snow!}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| *in the background* What? Y-Yes, I can!}}
{{TD|Steven| Please, trust me! *tosses Connie's phone into the snow and screams*}}
{{TD|Connie| Hey!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Beach House]}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie returns back to the beach house, where they find the Gems sitting in a triangle around the [[Warp Pad]], levitating the [[Shooting Star]] in the center of them.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| Hold it steady. We have to send this to the [[Galaxy Warp]] without warping ourselves.}}
{{TD|Pearl| This is too risky.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| No, it's not. Get over it.}}
{{TD|Pearl| If the Shooting Star goes off mid-warp, it could explode forever in [[Warp Space]]. And even if we ''do'' manage to destroy the entire Galaxy Warp, [[Homeworld Gems|they]] could still find another way to get here.}}
{{TD|Steven| Uhh, watcha doing'?}}
{{TD|Pearl| Steven?!}}
{{TD|Garnet| Pearl! No!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl loses focus and pulls her hand away in shock. Everyone scream as the Shooting Star stops levitating and touches the warp pad, exploding and destroying the whole place. The blue hypnotizing pattern flashes again.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Beach House, earlier that day]}}
{{TD|Garnet| *kisses Steven on the forehead* Mwah.}}
{{TD|Steven| Uhhhh... What? Garnet, what happened?}}
{{TD|Garnet| I passed my ability to you for just a moment.}}
{{TD|Steven| You mean... I had future visions?}}
{{TD|Garnet| Tell me what you saw.}}
{{TD|Steven| I saw... some good things, but mostly ''bad'' things.}}
{{TD|Garnet| And now you can make the right choice.}}
{{TD|Steven| Hmm! Connie, we have to go right this instant. *grabs Connie's hand and runs out of the house*}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. It's a Wash!]}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie arrive at Greg's car wash, when it begins to snow. Greg is already waiting there by his van.'')}}
{{TD|Greg| Would you look at this? An entire inch of snow.}}
{{TD|Steven| Dad, there's no time! We got to go ''now''!}}
{{TD|Greg| Wha-huh?}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie drags Greg into his van and he starts driving off. The van drives on the road with no hazards, and arrives in front of Connie's house safely. Dr. and Mr. Maheswaran open the house door to greet them as Connie run forth to hug them.'')}}
{{TD|Dr. Maheswaran| Connie! Oh, thank goodness you're safe.}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| Nice sweatshirt, Greg.}}
{{TD|Greg| Oh, thanks. *puts a hand on Steven's shoulder and gazes at him proudly*}}
{{TD|Steven| Well, we better get going. Bye, Connie. Sorry we can't stay and watch the snow.}}
{{TD|Connie| Yeah.}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| It's starting to get pretty bad out there. I don't know if you Universes should be driving in this weather.}}
{{TD|Dr. Maheswaran| Why don't you both stay here tonight?}}
{{TD|Steven & Greg| *gasps* Really?!}}
{{TD|Connie| Wow, Mom. That's... really cool.}}
{{TD|Dr. Maheswaran| It's... just safer that way. We Maheswarans are all about safety.}}
{{TD|Mr. Maheswaran| I'll make up the couch.}}
{{TD|Greg| A couch?! Ooh là là! *runs into the house* Château Maheswaran!}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie look at each other in excitement.'')}}
{{TD||[Time Skip — Night time]}}
{{TD||(''Greg is sleeping and snoring on a couch, while Steven sleeps on a different couch. Steven hears footsteps and slowly opens his eyes, noticing Connie standing at the bottom of the stairs. She sneaks over and sits besides Steven's couch, and the pair silently watch the snow fall outside the window.'')}}
