{{TD||(''Amethyst mumbles to Steven.'') }}
{{TD|Pearl |We've got to get Steven out of here! }}
{{TD|Garnet |*turns to Steven* I'm sending you back to the temple. }}
{{TD|Steven |But, Garnet, how are you gonna... (''Garnet bubbles Steven up.'') You can bubble me? }}

{{TD|Steven |Eh... Huh? *sees Nephrite, trembling in fear* It looks... so scared. *crawls towards it* Uhh, hi. Ah, it's okay. Look. *lies belly flat on the floor* Please don't be scared of me. See, I'm not gonna hurt you. Yeah, just relax. (''Nephrite begins to calm down.'') Yeah, that's it. Doesn't relaxing feel nice? You wanna come over here and relax with me? Yeah, we can totally just hang out and relax, right here on the floor. (''Nephrite starts crawling towards Steven.'') Yeah, don't be shy. We can be friends. My name's Ste- }}
{{TD|Pearl |*interrupts* STEVEN! Get away from that thing! }}
{{TD|Amethyst |Whoa, dude! }}
{{TD|Steven |Wait! It's not- }}
{{TD||(''Garnet leaps over and attempts to punch the frightened Nephrite, which it quickly dodges away. Pearl then jumps to Steven's side.'') }}

{{TD|Pearl |If that thing hurt you, so help me I'll- }}
{{TD|Steven |No! It didn't do anything! *runs in between Garnet and Nephrite* Garnet, don't hurt it! *spreads his arms out* I accidentally let it out of its bubble, but it didn't even try to hurt me. It's not like the other monsters, it's just scared and confused. Please, Garnet. I'm begging you. }}
{{TD||(''There is a dramatic pause as Steven, making a desperate face, and Garnet stare at each other.'') }}
{{TD|Garnet |I can't say no to that face. }}
{{TD|Pearl |Excuse me?! You can't be serious! }}
{{TD|Garnet |I think you should try and tame it, Steven. }}
{{TD|Steven |Garnet! *hugs Garnet's leg* Thank you so much. }}
{{TD|Pearl | Hmmm... }}
{{TD|Amethyst |*laughs at Pearl* Shut down by the G-squad! Ahahahaha! }}

{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[Beach House]]] }}
{{TD|Garnet |Alright, Steven, let's see if you can get it to calm down. }}

{{TD|Steven |Um, it still seems a little scared. }}
{{TD||(''A chain breaks apart from Nephrite. The Gems and [[Lion]] all brace themselves for battle.'') }}
{{TD|Steven |Maybe you guys could put your weapons away and watch from the house...? }}
{{TD|Pearl |Absolutely not! }}
{{TD|Garnet |*dispels her gauntlets* Steven can handle it. }}
{{TD|Pearl |Garnet! }}
{{TD|Garnet |Pearl? *walks away* }}
{{TD|Amethyst |Oh! Hmm, hmm! You just go Garneted! Aha! }}
{{TD||(''The Gems and Lion turn around and walk back to the temple.'') }}
{{TD|Steven |Okay, friend. It's just us now. (''Nephrite breaks free of chains.'') Calm, calm, calm. Just like before. Just relax and let your hair down. (''Nephrite begins to calm down again.'') You wanna come over here? (''Nephrite jitters on the spot.'') C'mon, it won't be like before. How about we try something else? Hmmmm. Oh, what's this? }}
{{TD||(''Steven pulls out a bag of [[Chaaaaps]] from his jacket.'') }}
{{TD|Steven |Chiiips! You like chiiiiips? You wanna chiipps? Yeah? Yeah? *takes a chip out of the bag* Awwww, look at this chip! Yum, yum, yum! *eats the chip* Mmm, tasty, tasty. Try it! }}

{{TD|Pearl |Steven, this is unacceptable! }}
{{TD|Steven |Aw, come on, Pearl. *feeds and pets Nephrite* She can help us on like missions and stuff. }}
{{TD|Pearl |Oh, no! Out of the question! }}
{{TD|Steven |Awww... }}
{{TD|Pearl |*sighs and turns to Garnet and Amethyst* Well, we can't return to the Ice Cavern now. We have to stay and deal with Steven and his situation. }}
{{TD|Amethyst |Well, I don't know how we're gonna get through all those ice boulders without causing a cave-in anyway. }}
{{TD|Garnet |Hmmm. That's how.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet looks at Nephrite, whose saliva is dripping of her mouth and burning another hole into the wooden floor.'') }}

{{TD|Pearl |Shooting Star, here we come. }}
{{TD||(''The Crystal Gems proceed to venture through the Ice Cavern, as Nephrite helps with her acid spray to overcome any obstacles in their way. The Crystal Gems eventually arrive in a room containing the Shooting Star.'') }}
{{TD|Crystal Gems |Whoa. }}
{{TD|Steven |Cool! }}
{{TD|Pearl |There it is! The Shooting Star! *proceeds the pool in the center of the room* An ancient elemental, so hot, and so volatile, it can only be contained in ice. Bare skin cannot endure its intensity! }}
{{TD|Steven |What do you do with the Shooting Star? }}
{{TD|Amethyst |Uhh, you shoot it. }}
{{TD|Pearl |Garnet, you'll have to use your gauntlets as not to hurt your hands. }}
{{TD||(''Garnet summons her gauntlets and prepares to dip her hands into the pool, when Nephrite suddenly starts spazzing out at the sight of it.'') }}
{{TD|Steven |No, no, no! Not now! *rushes to Nephrite* }}
{{TD|Garnet |Something's wrong. }}
{{TD||(''Nephrite continues to spazz in fear and starts shooting acid all over the ceiling, causing stalactites to fall from the ceiling.'') }}
{{TD|Steven |Whoa! }}
{{TD||(''All of the Gems duck to avoid the falling stalactites, when an eruption occurs from the pool, frightening Nephrite even more.'') }}
{{TD|Pearl |Steven! *summons her spear* I knew this would happen! }}
{{TD||(''Pearl charges towards Nephrite and smacks her against a wall. The impact causes a crack to occur in a giant stalactite.* }}
{{TD|Steven |Aaah! Pearl, stop! It was an accident! *accidentally pulls Nephrite's hair* Sorry for pulling. }}
{{TD|Garnet |Steven! *kicks the agitated Nephrite away* }}
{{TD|Steven |Noooo! *begins to tear up* }}
{{TD||(''Nephrite gets up and charges toward Garnet and Steven. Pearl and Amethyst blocks her path and continues to attack her. The crack in the giant stalactite continues to worsen.

{{TD|Steven |Stop! *runs in between Nephrite and the Gems* You don't need to fight! This isn't you! *starts crying* You're not a monster anymore! You're more than that. We have so many memories now! Remember the chip times? *walks towards Nephrite, but she backs away* And how you saved me from that vicious seagull?}}
{{TD||(''Nephrite stops backing up.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|And how we became best friends? *pulls her in for a hug* You have to remember! This all happened today! }}

{{TD|Steven |Noooo!}}
{{TD||(''Nephrite groans in pain and poofs into a green cloud. Her gem then rolls over to Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Steven |You saved me. *grieves* }}
{{TD|Garnet |Steven, you did a good job trying to tame the Centipeetle. Your [[Rose Quartz|mother]] would be so proud. }}
{{TD|Steven |She would? }}
{{TD|Garnet |The truth is, Rose Quartz had tried to use her powers to save these monsters too, but she was never able to heal them. }}
{{TD|Steven |Never? But if she couldn't do it... }}
{{TD|Pearl |Who knows? Maybe when you have better control of your powers, you might help them in ways even your mother couldn't. }}
{{TD|Garnet |Even this one. *points at Nephrite's gem* }}
{{TD|Steven |I'll keep it safe. *holds his hands over Nephrite's gem, and bubbles it* }}
{{TD|Amethyst |Whoa! }}
{{TD|Pearl |Steven, you can bubble Gems! }}
{{TD|Steven |Wow! Wait for me, Centipeetle. I promise I'll heal you up someday. *sends the bubbled gem away to the temple* Ooh! Wait! *reaches for something in his jacket* }}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Burning Room] }}
{{TD||(''Back in the Burning Room, the bubbled Nephrite's gem reappears, followed by a bag of Chaaaaps in a bubble next to her. Two star irises then zoom in on the two bubbles, ending the episode.'') }}
