{{TD||(''Steven eating [[Minor Objects/Food#Potato Chips|potato chips]], staring at the [[Warp Pad]] for the [[Crystal Gems|Gems]] to return then, [[Garnet]], [[Amethyst]] and [[Pearl]] warp in'')}}
{{TD|[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]| You're back!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Hey, Steven, look at this! *pulls out a small [[Electric Skulls|Electric Skull]] which cackles*}}
{{TD|Pearl| Whoa! What are you, crazy?! *knocks the Electric Skull out of Amethyst's hand and steps on it*}}
{{TD|Steven| What the heck was that?}}
{{TD|Pearl| An Electric Skull. Our [[Crystal Temple|Crystal Palace]] was swarming with them. *sits down on couch*}}
{{TD|Amethyst| They were after this. *takes out [[The Hourglass]] from fanny-pack*}}
{{TD|Steven| *entranced* Can I see that?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Yeah, sure. *Hourglass falls into Steven’s hand*}}
{{TD|Pearl| *interrupts* No! It's extremely powerful, we shouldn’t have even brought it home.}}
{{TD|Steven| Garnet, tell Pearl to let me see the thing- *Garnet puts finger to his lips*}}
{{TD|Garnet| Shh... *puts her finger on Steven's lip*}}
{{TD|Steven| Aw, man. I wanna come next time. I even wrote us a song. *takes out ukulele* It’s like “If you’re...” W-wait, hold on. *tunes ukulele, sings [[We Are the Crystal Gems|We Are The Crystal Gems]]*}}
{{TD|Steven|<poem>If you're evil, and you're on the rise
You can count on the four of us taking you down
'Cause we're good and evil never beats us
We'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas

We... are the Crystal Gems!
We'll always save the day!
And if you think we can't,
We'll always find a way!
That's why the people of this world believe in
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven!</poem>}}
{{TD|All Gems| *clapping*}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *chuckles* What’s with the part about pizzas?}}
{{TD|Steven| That’s just a best case scenario.}}
{{TD|Pearl| You wanna sing that during battle?}}
{{TD|Steven| Yeah.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Why?}}
{{TD|Steven| Because I’ll look really cool!}}
{{TD|Pearl| *laughing* You’ll look... like a clown!}}
{{TD||(''Pearl and Amethyst laugh.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| Hey! Don’t make fun of Steven.}}
{{TD|Pearl| Look Steven, you’re still too young to come with us. You don’t even have powers in your gem.}}
{{TD|Steven| But I wanna help!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Why don’t you grab us some doughnuts? *gives him a wad of money and hints at it*}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Steven’s Room]}}

{{TD|Steven| *sighs* Hey, Lars. *slams money on counter* Just give me three doughnuts.}}
{{TD|Lars| You want me to connect them with a hot dog?}}
{{TD|Steven| *gasps, looks at “[[Minor Objects/Food#Dog-Nut|dog-nut]]” ad* Oh, no, they’re not for me. It’s for Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl.}}
{{TD|Lars| *getting doughnuts* What are they anyways? Witches or ghosts or something?}}
{{TD|Steven| They’re Crystal Gems and they save the world, like all the time. And I’m a Crystal Gem too.}}
{{TD|Lars| Aren’t they all like, hot girls? You’re not exactly a hot girl, Steven.}}
{{TD||(''Steven grabs doughnuts and walks out'')}}
{{TD|Sadie| Ugh, lay off!}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Big Donut- Steven]}}
{{TD|Steven| *grumpily to himself* “Not exactly a hot girl.” Well, if I was, I wouldn’t be talking to ''you''. *gasps* Aw, I should have said that, that’s really funny! *Hourglass activates, whites out screen*}}

{{TD|Lars| *frustrated in expression* You’re a joke! You know that right?! You’re a big joke!}}
{{TD|Sadie| Lay off! *Steven walks out again*}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Big Donut]}}
{{TD|Steven| The thing! Did it let me do that comeback to Lars? Ugh, what’s his problem? Calling me a joke. *pretending to talk to Lars* Must be tougher for you, Lars, at least people like jokes. Ah that’s what I should’ve-! *Hourglass activates, gasps happily*}}

{{TD||[Trans. Int. Steven’s Room]}}
{{TD|Garnet| I just have a bad feeling.}}
{{TD||(''Steven enters as the Gems look at him.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| I was at the Big Donut, and Lars was giving me trouble, and he was like “You’re a joke!” and then, the thing *reveals Hourglass* took me back in time, and I was like-}}
{{TD|Pearl| Wh-Why do you have that? *stares at Amethyst* Why did you give him that!?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| He wanted to see it! I was letting him see it!}}
{{TD|Pearl| *to Steven* We’ve been protecting that Hourglass for a thousand years. Now that it’s activated, it can only be used by ''you'' for its chosen purpose! What did you use it for?}}
{{TD|Steven| Comebacks...?}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *laughs*}}
{{TD|Pearl| ''Comebacks?'' You used it, for ''comebacks?!''}}

{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Big Donut]}}
{{TD||(''Electric Skull wandering around outside, bringing thunder clouds, Gems and Steven approach'')}}
{{TD|Pearl| We’ve led it right to us. Oh, Steven, it can see the holes you’ve ripped in the fabric of time!}}
{{TD|Garnet| Steven! Why are you such a butt face?}}
{{TD|Steven| *hurt* W-W-What?}}
{{TD|Garnet| Gems! Call your weapons!}}

{{TD|Garnet| No, this is bad, Steven. Help!}}
{{TD|Steven|*tearing up* Ah, I can’t. I-I’m... *realization*  "A butt face". *takes out Hourglass* “Why am I such "a butt face"? I know you are but what am- No, that’s not good enough! I-I can come up with a better line than that with my... butt closed. Oh, that doesn’t make any sense! Uh, butt face... Why am I- *shocked by lighting* Aah! Garnet!! Uh, butt face... I can’t help it... WHAT'S ''YOUR'' EXCUSE?!! *Hourglass activates*}}
{{TD||(''Garnet, previously'')}}
{{TD|Garnet| Why are you such a butt face?}}
{{TD|Steven| *eyes closed* I can’t help it, what’s your excuse?}}
{{TD|Garnet| *gasps* You did it! What happened?}}
{{TD|Steven| *analyzing* Get back! *pushes Garnet, ES slams ground, throwing Steven up near Big Donut sign* Oh, oh, get up here! (''The Gems jump up, behind sign'') We can’t get close to it but we’ve got to take out its hair thingies! Everybody push!}}
