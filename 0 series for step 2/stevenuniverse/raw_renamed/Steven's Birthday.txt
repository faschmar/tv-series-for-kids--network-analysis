{{TranscriptH|{{TD||[Open Ext. [[The Barn]]]}}
{{TD||(''The [[Crystal Gems]] are preparing decorations for Steven's birthday. [[Amethyst]] is blowing balloons, [[Pearl]] is making a ribbon bow, and [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] is helping [[Garnet]] make a banner.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|I can't believe it's finally my birthday. You're sure it's okay we're taking a break from [[Gem Drill (object)|the drill]]?}}
{{TD|Pearl|[[Peridot]] will keep us on schedule.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Yo, Peri! You sure you don't want to get in on this?}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst blows up a balloon that looks like Peridot and it pops. Peridot glares, puts on her welding goggles and disappears around the corner of the barn.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|We should celebrate our progress. We should celebrate ''your'' progress. You've grown a lot this year.}}
{{TD|Pearl|He certainly has.}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah. Yeah, I guess so!}}
{{TD||(''A car horn is then heard, as [[Greg's Van]] arrives. Wearing a red party dress and a floppy sun hat, [[Connie Maheswaran|Connie]] climbs out clutching a suitcase.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|Steven!}}
{{TD|Steven|Connie!}}
{{TD|Connie|Happy birthday! *runs up to hug Steven*}}
{{TD|Steven|Thanks. Welcome to the party! May I offer you... a refreshment? *pulls out two [[Minor Objects/Food#Durian Juice|juice boxes]] from behind him*}}
{{TD|Connie|Oh, Steven! How genteel.}}
{{TD|Steven & Connie|Clink! *pats their juice boxes together*}}
{{TD|Steven|So, this is the barn! I'm surprised your parents are letting you stay for the weekend.}}
{{TD|Connie|*chuckles* It wasn't easy. They'd only let me come after equipping me with every piece of safety gear on the planet.}}
{{TD|[[Greg Universe|Greg]]|What should I do with this defibrillator!? *pulls a defibrillator out of the back of the van*}}
{{TD|Connie|*blushes* Um, we can just leave it in the car for now!}}
{{TD|Steven|*giggles* Well, I'm glad you could make it.}}
{{TD|Connie|Me too.}}
{{TD|Greg|Alright, move it Connie, I was his best friend first. Happy birthday! *hugs Steven tightly* Ooookay, schtu-bal. Let me get a look at you.}}
{{TD|Steven|*embarrassed* Daaad!}}
{{TD|Greg|Sorry, I just can't believe my little boy is growing up so quickly. Seems like just yesterday you were a baby, and now you're turning fourteen years old.}}
{{TD|Connie|*does a spit-take* Steven! You're fourteen!?}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah?}}
{{TD|Connie|But I'm only twelve and three quarters! You're older than me? I-I don't believe it!}}
{{TD|Greg|Well sure, check it out. (''Greg pulls out a book with a star on the front under the name "Steven Quartz Universe". He opens it to reveal images of Steven on his birthday throughout the years.'') Let's see, we have infant, baby, toddler - what's it called - adolescent, adolescent, adolescent, adolescent... Whoa, looks like you stagnated there a little bit, buddy.}}
{{TD|Connie|Mr. Universe, could I... show you how the defibrillator works?}}
{{TD|Greg|Oh, uh, sure! Be right back, kiddo. *walks off with Connie*}}
{{TD||[Trans. back of Greg's Van]}}
{{TD||(''Steven decides to eavesdrop on Connie and Greg's conversation.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|So he's not going to grow up?}}
{{TD|Greg|Well, it's hard to say. He's a [[Gems|Gem]], and Gems don't really grow up. I mean, I've known the Gems since I was 22, and they never change! They just are what they are. But Steven's not like the other Gems, he's half-human. So, I'm not really sure how he's gonna age. We're just gonna have to wait and see.}}
{{TD|Connie|Yes, right.}}
{{TD|Greg|Are you okay?}}
{{TD|Connie|Yeah, yeah.}}
{{TD|Greg|Human beings? *holds out his hand*}}
{{TD|Connie|Human beings. *high-fives Greg*}}
{{TD||(''Steven ponders with visible concerns.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. [[The Barn]]]}}
{{TD||(''Everyone is setting up the birthday party. Steven tries to hang up the banner on the barn, but he is too short.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Hey, birthday man! What'cha doing?}}
{{TD|Steven|I want to hang up this banner. So-}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Dude, it would be easier you just ''streeeeetch'' right up here! *extends her limbs and holds the banner at the barn's door* Hahaha! How's that?}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh yeah...}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Come on! What's the verdict? I can't hold this forever.}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh, it looks great. *gives a thumbs-up*}}
{{TD|Greg|There's my b-day guy.}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst retracts her limbs back to normal and walks away, while Greg, carrying [[Steven's Birthday Suit]], approaches Steven.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Uh, what's up dad?}}
{{TD|Greg|We're almost ready to start. Got your birthday cape and crown ready too. Here. *hands the birthday suit to Steven* Put it on and go wait in the barn. *pushes Steven into the barn and snickers* Okay now, sit tight. You're gonna love this.}}
{{TD||(''Greg shuts the barn door with Steven inside. Steven throws his birthday suit aside and looks at his hands. He clenches his hands and begins to focus. Fade to black.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|*knocking on the door* Okay Steven, open up!}}
{{TD||(''Steven opens the barn door, and Greg, Connie and the Gems are standing outside, presenting a [[Cookie Cat]]-shaped birthday cake.'')}}
{{TD|Greg, Connie & the Gems|SURPRI-! *collectively gasp*}}
{{TD|Garnet|Wow.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Oh my.}}
{{TD|Greg|Huh?}}
{{TD||(''Everyone glare in shock, as Steven, now taller than usual, smiles and walks towards them, carefully taking each step forward.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Steven... Are you feeling okay?}}
{{TD|Garnet|Heh, you look good Steven.}}
{{TD|Steven|*in teenager voice* Oh! *chuckles* Thanks, Garnet.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Dude, your neck!}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, uh, what about it?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|You ''HAVE'' one!}}
{{TD|Connie|So, you just grew... all of a sudden?}}
{{TD|Steven|I had a magical growth spurt, just now. Cool, right?}}
{{TD|Connie|Oh, right! It's totally cool!}}
{{TD|Garnet|Alright then, let's get this party started. *blows out the birthday candles*}}
{{TD|Greg|Yeah, let's eat this cookie cake!}}
{{TD||[Time Skip]}}
{{TD||(''Connie and Steven sit alone on a picnic mat, when [[Lion]] naps besides them.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|Here, Steven. *gives Steven a present*}}
{{TD|Steven|Wow, thanks.}}
{{TD|Connie|Oh, you don't have to untie that. It's just a box made to ''look'' like I spent a lot of time wrapping it. *giggles*}}
{{TD|Steven|*opens the box, tossing away the lid* Ohhh a new shirt! What a pretty color.}}
{{TD|Connie|Try it on.}}
{{TD||(''Steven puts on the shirt and tries to button it up.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|Oh, I guess it doesn't fit since-}}
{{TD|Steven|No, don't worry. It fits fine just like this!}}
{{TD||(''Steven decides to wear the shirt like a coat and giggles.'')}}
{{TD||[Time Skip]}}
{{TD||(''Steven, Amethyst, Pearl and Connie are playing badminton together.'')}}
{{TD|Pearl|Here it comes!}}
{{TD|Connie|I got it, Pearl! *hits the shuttlecock*}}
{{TD|Pearl|Nice, Connie.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Hiiii-yah! *hits the shuttlecock out of the field, and it lands on a tree*}}
{{TD|Pearl|If you hit it, you get it.}}
{{TD|Connie|No worries, I'll grab it.}}
{{TD||(''Connie runs up to the tree and tries to jump and grab the shuttlecock, but fails. She then tries to climb the tree.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Connie, let me.}}
{{TD||(''Steven runs up, jumps and grabs onto the branch, causing the shuttlecock drop off the tree.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|Oh, cool, thanks Steven! *picks up the shuttlecock*}}
{{TD|Steven|No problem, Connie.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Yo, bring back that shuttlecock!}}
{{TD|Steven|Huh?}}
{{TD||(''Connie runs off, when Steven's arm begins to shrink down to its former size.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*gasps* Oh no!}}
{{TD||(''Steven then uses his gem power to stretch his arm again, and he sighs in a strained relief.'')}}
{{TD||[Time Skip - Evening]}}
{{TD||(''Pearl, Amethyst, Connie and Steven are dancing, while Garnet and Greg browse an array of vinyl disks to play. Greg pulls out a disc cover titled "Stella", and Garnet shoves her hand in Greg's face. Everyone is having fun, although Steven seems to be straining and sweating.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|This one goes out to the birthday boy, and his best friend.}}
{{TD||(''A calm romantic music begins to play, and Steven and Connie laugh. They both then begin dancing together.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|I still can't believe all this time you were older than me. You should sneak me into a PG-13 movie sometime.}}
{{TD|Steven|*sweating* Oh yeah...}}
{{TD|Connie|*giggles* No, I'm just kidding, I would never ask you to break the law. It's funny that I have to look up at you now though.}}
{{TD|Steven|*gets fidgety* Funny good or funny bad?}}
{{TD|Connie|Funny good. *leans on Steven's chest, causing him to blush*}}
{{TD|Pearl|Aw... Steven's having fun.}}
{{TD|Garnet|We know how to throw a party.}}
{{TD|Steven|*clears his throat* Excuse me for a moment Connie, I'm gonna go freshen up. Be right back.}}
{{TD||(''Steven runs to the side of the barn, seemingly out of view of everyone, and shrinks himself back to normal size.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|*in normal voice* Ohhh geez... *slumps against the wall in exhaustion* If I can just keep this up for the rest of my life, no one will suspect a thi-}}
{{TD||(''Steven's eyes widen, as he spots Greg and Amethyst, playing with a piñata, glaring at him. Greg then drops the piñata in shock.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|What are you ''doing?!?''}}
{{TD|Steven|W-Wha... Well uh... *ages himself again * What are... *in teenager voice* YOU doing?!?}}
{{TD|Greg|What are YOU doing to your body?!?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Woah, woah, woah, have you been stretching yourself out all day?}}
{{TD|Steven|No! I was just... ''slouching.''}}
{{TD|Greg|Why are you doing this? It... really isn't like you.}}
{{TD|Steven|''Because,'' Dad, I can't stay a kid forever, when Connie grows up and becomes president what is that gonna make me? '''First Boy!?'''}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Steven, you can't just keep stretching forever. If you hold it too long, you could really hurt yourself.}}
{{TD|Steven|Yeah well, I'm half human so maybe it works different for me, we'll just have to wait and see, right?}}
{{TD|Greg|*sigh* Steven...}}
{{TD||(''Steven walks off, while Amethyst and Greg exchange concerned looks.'')}}
{{TD||[Time Skip - Night-time]}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Connie are sitting on a mat and star-gazing.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|That one's... "''Canis helicopterus''".}}
{{TD|Steven|*sweating profusely* Uh-uh, "Helicopterus"?}}
{{TD|Connie|Yeah, [[Dogcopter]], get it? *elbows Steven playfully* Now you make one up!}}
{{TD|Steven|Okay, um... *clears his throat* That one's, uh, snake constellation.}}
{{TD|Connie|That's... pretty good.. Are you okay? It looks like you're gonna throw up.}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh yeah, e-everything's fine! *forces a smile*}}
{{TD|Connie|Okay... that's good. You know, to be honest, I was a little worried before. This might sound silly, but... *leans towards Steven* I'm really glad that I'm going to get grow up with you.}}
{{TD||(''Steven becomes overwhelmed and begins to shrink, seemingly disappearing into his clothes.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|...Steven? *pulls Steven's shirt aside, revealing an infant Steven* Steven?! What's going on? What happened?}}
{{TD|Steven|Whaa?}}
{{TD||(''Steven blushes and examines his shrunken body. He looks at Connie and begins to cry. Connie then carries the crying infant Steven to show to everyone.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|We were just talking then all of a sudden-}}
{{TD|Pearl|He turned back into a baby?!}}
{{TD|Connie|YES!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*takes Steven* Dude, I told you... Stretching your body out for that long is ''not'' good for you!}}
{{TD||(''Steven speaks baby talk in response.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*holds Steven up to Pearl* Here you go, Pearl.}}
{{TD|Pearl|Oh, no, no, don't give him to me!}}
{{TD|Garnet|Hand him over, Amethyst. *removes her visor*}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*gives Steven to Garnet* Here you go.}}
{{TD||(''Garnet holds Steven up and starts blinking her eyes one by one. She then sticks out her tongue and makes funny noises to cheer Steven up. Steven, however, keeps crying.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet|My power means nothing to an infant.}}
{{TD|Greg|Okay, this is my department. *takes Steven from Garnet*}}
{{TD|Connie|What are you going to do?}}
{{TD|Greg|Don't worry, I got this.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Greg's Van]}}
{{TD||(''Greg begins driving Connie and Steven, who is still crying, away from the barn while "[[Let Me Drive My Van (into Your Heart)]]" plays in the background. Connie tries waving a maraca to cheer Steven up but it does not work.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|How can the Gems not know what to do?}}
{{TD|Greg|You think they know the first thing about raising a baby? That was all me, but I don't get it, driving always used to calm him down.}}
{{TD|Connie|But, how do we change him back?}}
{{TD|Greg|I don't know! Look Connie, let me take you home, I-I'll call you when this all this gets sorted out.}}
{{TD||(''Connie turns to look at Steven, while he tries to communicate in baby talk.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|W-Wait no, I wanna stay.}}
{{TD|Greg|Are you sure?}}
{{TD|Connie|Yeah, I just want to be there for Steven. Don't worry Steven, it doesn't matter to me what age it seems like you are, I wanna hang out with you no matter what. Your dad still has his car wash and the Gems have to do gem stuff so I'll watch you when they're not around. I can come see you after I'm done training with Pearl too. Doesn't that sound fun?}}
{{TD||(''Connie holds up her finger to Steven, coos happily and holds onto it.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Look at that, he finally stopped crying.}}
{{TD|Connie|Well that's a start.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Ahem.}}
{{TD|Greg|What's up, Amethyst?}}
{{TD||(''It is revealed that Amethyst had shapeshifted into a carseat for the infant Steven the whole time.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Baby Steven needs changin'.}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. The Barn, The Next Morning]}}
{{TD||(''Connie wakes up in her tent, only to find Steven's shirt lying next to her.'')}}
{{TD|Connie|Oh my gosh. Ooh my gosh! Did he get even smaller? Steven's microscopic! *tears up* He's reverted back to a zygote! *rushes out of the tent* Everyone! Steven is-}}
{{TD||(''Connie sees Steven, back to normal, wearing the shirt she gave him.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Look, it fits now.}}
{{TD|Connie|*wipes her tears* You're back to normal! *hugs Steven*}}
{{TD|Steven|Sorry this was a disaster, I wanted to look older for you. *blushes*}}
{{TD|Connie|That doesn't matter.}}
{{TD|Steven|I... heard what you said in the van. It's really okay if I don't age like a human?}}
{{TD|Connie|Of course it is. I like you just the way you are. *smushes Steven's cheeks*}}
{{TD|Steven|Oof, okay.}}
{{TD|Connie|Uh... Steven? You've got something on your cheek.}}
{{TD|Steven|Huh? *feels it and gasps* It's a facial hair!}}
{{TD|Connie|Really!?}}
{{TD|Steven|DAD!}}
{{TD|Greg|What is it little man?}}
{{TD|Steven|Look at this! *points at his facial hair*}}
{{TD|Greg|Holy smokes! You're growin' a beard! You really are getting older. *hugs Steven* Everybody! Look at this!}}
{{TD|Pearl|Unbelievable.}}
{{TD|Garnet|Very impressive.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Is there more where that came from?}}
{{TD||(''The Gems start laughing together, and Connie giggles in relief too. The star iris then closes on Connie smiling, ending the episode.'')}}
