{{TD|Amethyst| NO! I get mad at myself! That's, ugh, the thing I do. I get mad at myself and then it makes me suck at everything I do even more.}}
{{TD|Steven| *sighs* Amethyst, you don't suck. You do so many cool things. You have two whips, two whips! And the dash thing? Amethyst, you're so much better than me!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| No way. You have [[Rose Quartz|Rose's]] shield, and bubble, and the floating thing, and- Ugh, I'd just be floating all day.}}
{{TD|Steven| Floating? I forget to use that half the time! And the rest of the time my powers aren't guaranteed to work. I'm- I'm way worse than you.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| *crosses her arms* Nah-Uh! I'm the worst!}}
{{TD|Steven| No way, I am! I'll prove it, I'll- I'll ''fight'' you and show you how bad I am.}}

{{TD|Steven| ''NO'' holding back!}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Grrr! *summons her whip* Gwaahhh!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst begins spin-dashes towards Steven, who quickly sidesteps and avoids it. Amethyst turns around at the arena seating and charges back at Steven.

{{TD|Steven| *coughing* Wha?}}
{{TD||(''As the dust clouds fade away, Steven realized he is tangled up in Amethyst's whip. Amethyst then quickly tightens the whip around Steven, causing him to fall over.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Whoa! I did not see that coming! That was amazing.}}
{{TD|Amethyst| No, it's not! I don't do anything ''amazing!''}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst lashes her whip, sending an energy wave at Steven. He then quickly summons his bubble shield to protect himself from the energy wave, which in turns tears away the whip around him.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| You're the one who's amazing. *summons two whips and wraps them around Steven's bubble* Wha- Gwah!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst starts twirling the bubble around and smashing it into pillars. Steven braces himself for impact and suddenly adds spikes to his bubble, which lodges in the pillar.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| WHAT?! Is that new!? *exhales sharply* Because it's ''awesome!''}}
{{TD|Steven| No! It was an accident. Accidents are not ''awesome!!''}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Sure, right!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst tugs on the bubble to pull it off the pillar. Steven then dispels his bubble and dives towards Amethyst, kicking her in the back before rolling away.

{{TD|Amethyst| What?? DON'T SAVE-}}
{{TD||(''The shield hits Amethyst on the back of her head as it returns to Steven's hand.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Whoa! Ughhh... That was great!}}
{{TD|Steven| *dispels his shield* You think that was on purpose?}}

{{TD|Steven| Guess who remembered to floa- Whoa!}}
{{TD||(''Steven collides into a pillar and starts drifting away from the arena. Amethyst shapeshifts back to normal and quickly catches Steven with her whip. Both of them sighs in relief. Amethyst then yanks Steven in, slamming him down into the ground and creating a gigantic crater on the arena.'')}}

{{TD|Steven| ... Gwahh!}}
{{TD||(''Steven bursts out of the rubble in the crater, launching a large piece of debris at Amethyst, who quickly steps away in surprise.'') }}
{{TD|Amethyst| See?! I dropped you from the sky but you almost just won by, using a ''rock!'' Huh! If I can't beat you, I'm never gonna beat '''''Jasper!''''' }}
{{TD|Steven| You... You can totally beat me. You're not even trying. }}
{{TD|Amethyst| I am too! *lifts up the rock* Eeyaarh! }}
{{TD||(''Steven tries to lift a piece of the arena, but it snaps and causes him to fall backwards. Amethyst then tries to throw the rock at Steven, but it slips off her hands.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| I think we're both too good to be bad fighters. }}
{{TD|Amethyst| That's what ''you'' think. }}
{{TD|Steven| What does that even mean? }}
{{TD|Amethyst| I don't even know...! }}
{{TD||(''Steven and Amethyst charge at each other, attempting to punch each other, but they both miss and fall to the ground.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Huh. Hahahah! *starts laughing hysterically* }}
{{TD|Steven| Hahahah... What's wrong with us? *starts laughing with Amethyst* }}
{{TD|Amethyst| Hah... I know what's wrong with me. I'm not supposed to be small. And everyone's always acting like there's no problem. You can be anything you want to be, heh. No! I can't. Huh... *sighs* I can't even be the one thing I'm supposed to be, you know? }}
{{TD|Steven| Of course I do. I'm... not Rose Quartz. }}
{{TD|Amethyst| Oh no... Oh Steven!- }}
{{TD|Steven| Why do you think I've been working so hard? }}
{{TD|Amethyst| Well... It's paying off. }}
{{TD|Steven| Ahahahah, I sure hope so. }}
{{TD||(''Steven gets up and offers his hand to Amethyst, smiling. She smiles and swings her arm, but purposely misses his hand.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst| Eh.. *laughs and misses Steven's hand again* Uh... *finally grabs his hand* Ah! }}
{{TD||(''Amethyst stands up and laughs with Steven.'') }}
{{TD|Amethyst| Thanks Steven. }}
{{TD||(''Pearl then suddenly appears at the arena entrance, screaming in horror and anger.'') }}
