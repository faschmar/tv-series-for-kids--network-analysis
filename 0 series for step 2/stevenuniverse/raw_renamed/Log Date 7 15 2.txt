{{TD|Steven|They're stilts. You tie them on to your feet and then make you taller. I tried to spruce them up a bit. I dunno what it is about flames, but they just make everything cooler.}}
{{TD|Peridot|Why are you giving me these?}}
{{TD|Steven|Because I want you to feel nice! That's what gifts are for. You give them to your friends to show you care. And they go "wow, thanks!"}}

{{TD|Peridot|*quickly grabs and holds up the paper, revealing a shipping chart* Picture? This isn't just a picture Steven!

{{TD|Steven|Well, that's because Paulette likes Percy.}}
{{TD|Peridot|Paulette? Ha! Paulette has no place in the camp's hierarchy. Now Pierre, Pierre is a brute, Pierre laid waste to the three legged races! Pierre and Percy present the strongest battle formations, they'd destroy the camp!}}

{{TD|Garnet|Evening, Peridot.}}
{{TD|Peridot|Explain it to me, fusion! I can at least make sense of your existence if it's for a functional purpose. But you? You're not using your combined size and strength to do anything!}}
{{TD|Garnet|I'm doing something.}}

{{TD|Peridot|Eugh. You can do that alone.}}

{{TD|Tape Recorder (''Garnet'')|"Wait, keep it on a moment. Steven, you probably shouldn't have listened to Peridot's logs, but I know your curiosity comes from a place of caring. You should give the recorder back to her now. She's going to want to keep it."}}
