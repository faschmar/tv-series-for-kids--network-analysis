{{TD|Steven|They're stilts. You tie them on to your feet and then make you taller. I tried to spruce them up a bit. I dunno what it is about flames, but they just make everything cooler.}}
{{TD|Peridot|Why are you giving me these?}}
{{TD|Steven|Because I want you to feel nice! That's what gifts are for. You give them to your friends to show you care. And they go "wow, thanks!"}}

{{TD|Steven|Well, that's because Paulette likes Percy.}}
