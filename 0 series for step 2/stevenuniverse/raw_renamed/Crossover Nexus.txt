{{TD|Strike| Come out, come out wherever you are. I summoned you two heroes here to destroy you. And just like all the others, I will annihilate you!}}
{{TD|[[Garnet]]|(Grunts)}}
{{TD|Strike| Fine, I'll just summon some other hero to obliterate. Let's see... Ah, this one looks like he's got some fight in him. Let's play!}}
{{TD|Pen| Now summoning hero.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Oof!}}
{{TD|Pen| Success.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Hey, what's this spooky dump? And where are my friends?}}
{{TD|Strike| I am Strike. Howdy, hero -- and toodle-oo!}}
{{TD|K.O.| What, me?! I-I'm still just a hero in training.}}
{{TD|Strike| Yeah, I don't care.}}
{{TD|K.O.| (Whimpers)}}
{{TD|Garnet| (Grunts)}}
{{TD|K.O.| Huh? Wha-- Who?}}
{{TD|Garnet| No time for introductions.}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| Guys this way, c'mon!}}
{{TD|Strike| (Growls) If these heroes don't want to stay and play, I'll just have to pin them down.}}
{{TD|All| (Panting)}}
{{TD|Garnet| There!}}
{{TD|K.O.| You two seem like heroes, but I can't find either of you in my Pow Cards.}}
{{TD|Garnet| I'm a Crystal Gem. I fight off threats from outer space and protect my planet from anything that would harm it. The name's Garnet.}}
{{TD|K.O.| That's amazing! Uh, what do you do, little boy?}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| Uh, I'm Ten.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Oh! I'm sorry.}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| No, I'm Ben Ten... ...nyson. I travel around the country with my grandpa and cousin Gwen in an RV.}}
{{TD|K.O.| That's nice.}}
{{TD|Pen| Destroy heroes.}}
{{TD|All| (Startles)}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| Let's go Four Arms. It's Hero Time.}}
{{TD||(Ben Tennyson pressing the Omnitrix and turning into Four Arms)}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Oh, yeah! (Grunts)}}
{{TD|K.O.| Whoa!}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Did I fail to mention my Omnitrix, which lets me turn into 10 different super-cool aliens?}}
{{TD|K.O.| Who-ha-ha!}}
{{TD|Four Arms| My Omnitrix! I'm stuck like this without it!}}
{{TD|Garnet| Stop gawping, or it'll do worse.}}
{{TD|K.O.| (Shouts)}}
{{TD|Garnet| Ha! Ha! Take this!}}
{{TD|Pen| Spin attack.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| That don't look good.}}
{{TD|K.O.| (Strains) Thanks, Ben. Or should I call you Four Arms? It's kind of confusing.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Don't sweat it.}}
{{TD|K.O.| (Whimpers)}}
{{TD|Garnet| Huh? (Grunts)}}
{{TD|K.O.| Garnet! Your cool glasses!}}
{{TD|Garnet| We'd better get movin'. We'e got to lose it before it recovers and steals any more of our powers.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Your sunglasses were your power?}}
{{TD|Garnet| Not quite -- they just gave me the clarity and focus I need to use my future vision -- also, they're prescription.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| In there! New, new, new, new! All clear, guys! (Screams)}}
{{TD|K.O.| Four Arms!}}
{{TD|Four Arms| It's hideous!}}
{{TD|K.O.| Huh? Who are all these guys?}}
{{TD|Garnet| They must be heroes that couldn't escape Strike's...strike. Let's keep moving.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Man, if red Strike X'ed all these years, h-he be may stronger than I thought.}}
{{TD|K.O.| If all these heroes couldn't stop him, what could the three of us possibly do?}}
{{TD|Raven| (off-screen) Do what he isn't expecting, and go to his lair.}}
{{TD|K.O.| That's a great idea, Garnet!}}
{{TD|Garnet| I didn't say anything, K.O.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Ben?}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Dude, did that honestly sound like my voice to you?}}
{{TD|Raven| I said.}}
{{TD|K.O.| (Gasps) A hero!}}
{{TD|Raven| Hi.}}
{{TD|K.O.| (Strains) You've got X'ed by Strike, but you can still talk and stuff?}}
{{TD|Raven| I got protection spell off just before he X'ed me.}}
{{TD|Garnet| (Grunts)}}
{{TD|Raven| Thanks...you?}}
{{TD|Garnet| Garnet.}}
{{TD|K.O.| K.O.!}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Four Arms -- and Ben -- and, like, a bunch of other guys, too --}}
{{TD|Garnet| We need to know who you are and what this place is.}}
{{TD|Raven| I'm part of a group of superheroes called the Teen Titans. My name's Raven. Uh, excuse me? That's better. Before I got X'ed out, I learned this used to be a great city of heroes, but Strike appeared and stole everyone's powers.}}
{{TD|Strike| (Evil Laughs)}}
{{TD|Raven| He was still hungry, so he started summoning heroes from other dimensions to destroy. If we don't stop him, there'll be no heroes left...anywhere.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Why would he do something so cob-darn awful?}}
{{TD|Raven| Eh, it's his thing. It's what he does. He's like evil, you know pure evil or whatever.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Seems like this dude always has the element of surprise.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Maybe we should surprise him, and ambush him at his lair.}}
{{TD|Raven| That was literally the first thing I said.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Raven, want to join us?}}
{{TD|Raven| Eh, I don't know. I was having such a great time as a lifeless statue.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Ooh, a new friend! You can be the brains of our team.}}
{{TD|Raven| as usual.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Hey, Raven? Where is this evil lair anyway?}}
{{TD|Raven| Over there -- the giant fortress just past the impassable chasm.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Oh, okay. Neat.}}
{{TD|Raven| (Sighs) Still smarter than Beast Boy.}}
{{TD|K.O.| So, what kind of magic can you do?}}
{{TD|Raven| Uh, all of it? Normally I would wield my dimensional magic to get us home, but Strike stole my powers. I can still levitate but -- Azarath Metrion Zinthos! (Sighs) Nothing.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Whippley dip dipple. I just realized that we all come from teams of great heroes. Maybe the four of us can form a new team together. How about "O.K. Ben! Let's Go! Universe"?}}
{{TD|Four Arms, Garnet and Raven| (Laughs)}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Yeah, this is a pretty good time. (Laughs)}}
{{TD|K.O.| (Sighs)}}
{{TD|Four Arms| K.O., watch out!}}
{{TD|K.O.| (Gasps)}}
{{TD|Raven| Strike's traps.}}
{{TD|K.O.| W-- How are we supposed to get across that?!}}
{{TD|Raven| You guys all have flight powers, right?}}
{{TD|Four Arms| You know, one of my other forms can fly, actually.}}
{{TD|Raven| Really?! That's so cool! (Grumbling) And would be really useful in this situation.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| It's not my fault I don't have my Omnitrix, okay?}}
{{TD|Garnet| You double need to stop bickering and pay attention.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Ahh! Chompy fish!}}
{{TD|Raven| Everyone, hold on to my super-strong legs!}}
{{TD|K.O., Garnet and Four Arms| (Shouts)}}
{{TD|Garnet| Get…}}
{{TD|K.O. and Garnet| ...back!}}
{{TD|K.O.| Ha! Power fist!}}
{{TD|K.O. and Garnet| (Grunts)}}
{{TD|Raven| We're almost there! Hold on tight! Agh! Never mind. We're gonna die.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Leave it to me. Hup! No one hurts my friends. Rrrraw!}}
{{TD|K.O.| Wow! Thanks, Garnet.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Yeah, thanks, Garnet.}}
{{TD|Raven| This is it -- Strike's lair. Got to admit, he's got taste.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| What do we do now?}}
{{TD|K.O.| Whoa! (Shouts)}}
{{TD|Garnet| Run!}}
{{TD|Garnet, K.O., Four Arms and Raven| (Panting)}}
{{TD|Pen| Destroy Heroes.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Ah!}}
{{TD|Four Arms| What is it waiting for?}}
{{TD|Strike| (Laughs) Me.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| What?!}}
{{TD|Strike| I programmed ole blasty here to corner you -- not to destroy you.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| Oh. Phew!}}
{{TD|Strike| (Chuckles) I'm gonna do that myself.}}
{{TD|All| Uh-oh.}}
{{TD|Strike| And now to start my incredibly long, un-interruptible power-up sequence. Ra-a-a-a-a-a…}}
{{TD|Garnet| He's channeling dark magics for a single, fatal blow.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| We got to do something!}}
{{TD|Raven| Without our powers? Face it, he's got us pinned.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Pen... Pen... Pen! That's it! Power fist! Ha. Ta-da!}}
{{TD|Raven| What?}}
{{TD|K.O.| Well, I noticed all those piranha traps back there were red. So I figured this thing can create as well as destroy. Besides, it does look kind of like a big ole pen.}}
{{TD|Raven| That's an astonishing logical leap K.O.}}
{{TD|Four Arms, Raven and Garnet| (Shouts)}}
{{TD|K.O.| (Groans) Aaaand... Whoops, can't forget this.}}
{{TD|Four Arms| I'm too young to di-- My Omnitrix!}}
{{TD||(Four Arms transform back into Ben Tennyson)}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| Ah -- feels good to be a kid again!}}
{{TD|Raven| Ah, satisfying.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Ready, Garnet?}}
{{TD|Garnet| Well, that's our powers restored, but what about yours K.O.?}}
{{TD|K.O.| (Chuckles) Oh, well, I never actually lost my powers. The only thing I've been missing is my friends. But I just realized -- I have friends right here! And as long as we're together, nothing can stop us!}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| Good pep talk, bro!}}
{{TD|Garnet| Okay, K.O., let's be heroes.}}
{{TD|Strike| -...a-a-a-ah! There -- fully powered and ready to face heroes who are powerless. Now... Huh? Where dey go?}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| Hey, jerk!}}
{{TD|Strike| What?!}}
{{TD|Raven, K.O., Garnet and Ben Tennyson| O.K. Ben! Let's Go Universe!}}
{{TD|Strike| Oh, there you are. Ha! Goody. Now, perish! Wah! (Laughs)}}
{{TD|Garnet| (Grunts)}}
{{TD|Strike| Wha-- (Groans)}}
{{TD|Raven| Azarath Metrion Zinthos!}}
{{TD|Strike| (Grunts)}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| Got to find the right alien for the job!}}
{{TD||(Ben Tennyson pressing the Omnitrix and turning into Jake the Dog)}}
{{TD|Jake the Dog| What? For reals?}}
{{TD||(Jake the Dog changes into Prohyas Warrior)}}
{{TD|Dolphin Magisword| (Chatters)}}
{{TD||(Prohyas Warrior transform back into Ben Tennyson)}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| My Omnitrix! Why isn't this thing working?!}}
{{TD|K.O.| Ben! It's okay! Your Omni-thingy was made with Strike's power, and he has the power to summon any hero into this world.}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| (Chuckles) I see where your going with this. It's Hero Time!}}
{{TD|K.O.| You just need... (Shouts) ...a power fist!}}
{{TD||(Ben Tennyson transform into Robot Jones)}}
{{TD|Robot Jones| Ha ha ha ha ha.}}
{{TD||(Robot Jones changes into Festro)}}
{{TD|Festro| Yeah, yeah! Spring Break!}}
{{TD||(Festro changes into Uncle Grandpa)}}
{{TD|Uncle Grandpa| Good Morning!}}

{{TD||(Finn the Human transform back into Ben Tennyson)}}
{{TD|K.O.| Wow, Ben! You were incredible!}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| We were incredible.}}
{{TD|Raven| Yeah, we did all right.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Thank you. We made great teammates.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Thank you very much.}}
{{TD|Ben Tennyson| Ooh, I meant all the dudes in my Omnitrix, but you guys are okay, you, I guess.}}
{{TD|K.O.| That's nice. Thanks. Pen!}}
{{TD|Raven| Must be lost without its master's commands.}}
{{TD|Garnet| Then let's give it some of our own. This should reprogram it to make the world as good as new.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Let's make it better than new!}}
{{TD|Garnet| Done.}}
{{TD|K.O.| Whoa!}}
{{TD|Pen| Rebuilding.}}
