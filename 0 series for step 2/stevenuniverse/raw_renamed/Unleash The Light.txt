*[[Steven Universe (character)|'''Steven''']]: And... there! It's finished! Presenting: Steven Universe's [[Gem Homeworld#Era 3|Era 3]] Rules for dismantling the Empire! Whatcha think??
*'''[[Blue Pearl]]''': It's very nice. What do they say?
*'''Steven''': Let's see... The Diamonds no longer have [[The Great Diamond Authority|authority]]... Gem colonies are now free, independent planets... [[Gems]] must give up all [[Gem Weapons|weapons of war]]...
*'''[[Yellow Pearl]]:''' Oh! Oh! I've already reached out to [[Yellow Diamond|Yellow Diamond's]] colonies and initiated the disarming process! She ordered me to overise it personally!
*'''Steven''': That's great! But remember, you don't work for her anymore! You can keep helping if you want to -- but it's your choice! You're all free now!
*'''Yellow Pearl''': Oh, yes, well, I-I'll just finish this one last thing!
*'''[[Pink Pearl]]''': This is all very exciting. I certainly hope nothing goes wrong.
*'''Yellow Pearl''': Urm, speaking of weapons... There is still the matter of [[Light Prism|the Prisms]]...
*'''Steven''': Prisms? Wait, like... plural??
*'''Yellow Pearl''': Yes, of course. It seems one Prism was already decommissioned. That leaves two more still active. However, thus far I've been unsuccessful in contacting [[Pyrope]] and [[Demantoid]]...
*'''Steven''': Pyrope?? Demantoid???
*'''Blue Pearl''': If they don't respond to our ultimatum, we could send a battalion to retrieve their Prisms by force.
*'''Yellow Pearl''': Yes, that's it! We'll simply destory them to demonstrate the new guidelines for peace!
*'''Steven''': No! no more force! No more destroying -- remember??
*'''Yellow Pearl''': Oh, right...
*'''Pink Pearl''': Then what is the solution, Steven?
*'''Steven''': Hmmm... I think I know just [[Crystal Gems|the team]] for the job! We're heeeeeeere!
*'''[[Pearl]]''': This place certainly looks... fancy.
*'''[[Garnet]]''': C'mon team. We've got two Prisms to find.
*'''[[Amethyst]]''': Yeeeayuhh! Let's do this thing!
*'''Garnet''': Light constricts.
*'''Pearl''': These must've been created by remaining two Prisms.
*'''Amethyst''': I don't think this place got your "disarming" memo, dude.
*'''Steven''': Hey, little light guys! I know in the old days, right about now would be battle o'clock... But we don't need to do that anymore! It's Era 3! We're all on the same side now!
*'''Pearl''': We have no choice. They were made for only one purpose.
*'''Garnet''': It was still a good try, Steven. Gems. Weapons!
*'''Steven''': You're amazing as always, Garnet!
*'''Garnet''': Thanks, Steven.
*'''Pearl''': Hey, save some for me!
*'''Amethyst''': Not too shabby, P!
*'''Pearl''': Why thank you, Amethyst. But we're not in the clear yet!
*'''Steven''': Nothing can stop you, Pearl!
*'''Pearl''': Your encouragement is all I need, Steven!
*'''Steven''': All in a day's work! Huh?
*'''Garnet''': What is it, Steven?
*'''Steven''': Did you guys see that??
*'''Amethyst''': Oh man!! Was it something all super creepy and mysterious? Because if so, I'm here for it.
*'''Steven''': Yes, exactly!!
*'''Pearl''': Let's keep moving, you two.
*'''Steven''': Hmmm...
*'''Amethyst''': Ooo... Palace-y...
*'''Demantoid''': ... It's you.
*'''Steven''': Oh, um, hello giant face. Yeah, my name is...
*'''Pyrope''': Demantoid! Who's that you're speaking to, mmm?
*'''Steven''': Right, so, I'm --
*'''Pyrope''': I-it's him! I'm afraid the Palace of Light is closed today. So very sorry! GOODBYE!!
*'''Demantoid''': ...
*'''Amethyst''': Rude!
*'''Garnet''': Looks like we'll need to see ourselves in.
*'''Pearl''': This barrier appears to be Prism tech but... even more advanced than what we saw last time. I'm not sure we're going to unlock this.
*'''Amethyst''': Maybe we can ask this [[George|guy]]?
*'''Pearl''': Steven! Is that your old prism??
*'''Steven''': No way!! What are you doing here, little buddy?? I thought you went off to see the world! Not this world, of course -- the other one! Y'know, [[Earth]]!
*'''Prism''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Oh? You wanna show us something? Wow!! Is this the new you??
*'''Prism''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Amethyst''': What's it saying, Steven??
*'''Steven''': The Prism just chose a name! Everyone, meet George!
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': You look so great!! I'm so proud of you!
*'''Amethyst''': George!! That's mah boi right there!!
*'''Garnet''': Welcome to the team, George.
*'''Steven''': Oh, I guess he needs to rest.
*'''Garnet''': And we need to look forward. Look.
*'''Amethyst''': Well, that worked out. More Light losers! Steven, where's our new secret weapon??
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': He doesn't wanna fight unless he absolutely has to! It's okay, George! I know you don't wanna be a weapon anymore. You don't have to! I just know you're gonna be a big help in each other important ways!
*'''Amethyst''': Eh, no big. We got this.
*'''Steven''': GUYS! I can't believe I almost forgot! When in a pickle, you can always count on... [[Cheeseburger Backpack (object)|The CHEESEBURGER BACKPACK]]! Ooo! Ooo!
*'''Garnet''': What is it, Steven?
*'''Steven''': T-T-TREASURE CHEST!!!
*'''Garnet''': That's the spirit. Why don't you do the honors, Steven.
*'''Steven''': Eeeeee!
*'''Amethyst''': Haha! You still get so jazzed over stuff like this, huh?
*'''Steven''': How could you not!! Well, do ya do, [[Warp Pad]]! I'm sure you'll come in handy later!
*'''Garnet''': Another refracted light barrier.
*'''Steven''': Hey, George... could you lend us a hand?
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Aw, it's okay, little buddy. Thanks for trying!
*'''Garnet''': This barrier is more fortified than the last. We'll need to find keys to unlock it.
*'''Amethyst''': Uuuuugh! Keys?? That's always so much work...
*'''Pearl''': Unless... Got it! There she is. I've accessed a backdoor into her transmissions.
*'''Demantoid''': ...I'm en route to [[Gem Homeworld/Locations#Crystal System Colony 215|Crystal System Colony 215]]. Phase one is underway.
*'''Pearl''': CSC-215. It's a mining colony on a small moon. One of Yellow's Pretty remote, from the looks of it.
*'''Garnet''': If we can't proceed further into the Palace, we must pursue Demantoid directly.
*'''Amethyst''': That's what I'm talking about! Let's get this show on the road!
*'''Steven''': Let's do it to it. Am I missing something here? Don't worry, guys. Once we find Demantoid, there's still a chance she'll hear us out and release her Prism.
*'''Garnet''': Yes. But we must also prepare for the opposite scenario.
*'''Pearl''': Demantoid... we need more intel on her. You guys get a head start on that moon. I have a different lead to follow.
*'''Steven''': Okay, be careful, Pearl!! Maybe one of our other friends will wanna tag along?
*'''Garnet''': Here we are.
*([[Lapis Lazuli|Lapis]] arrives)
*'''Steven''': Lapis, you came!
*'''Lapis''': Hey guys, sorry I'm late. Looking forward to helping out this time.
*'''Steven''': Hooray for friends!! When it comes to fantastical prism adventures. Third times a charm.
*'''Lapis''': I'm so ready for this. And that's how it's done.
*'''Garnet''': Steven, look.
*'''Lapis''': Cool key. Looks important.
*'''Steven''': Oh man! We can totally use this key on that rainbow door in the palace!
*'''Amethyst''': Sweet! Now we can go lay the smackdown on those two Prism Punks!
*'''George''': ...
*'''Amethyst''': ...no offense, George. Whaddya say, Steve-o? Should we head back to that crazy ol' palace?
*'''Steven''': You know it!
*'''Garnet''': Not so fast. The rainbow barrier had three locks. Three locks means three keys.
*'''Amethyst''': You're bumming me out so hard right now.
*'''Steven''': I'm sure we'll find the other two soon. Let's keep going!
*'''Lapis''': Hey, Steven, y'know what this adventure totally reminds me of? One of those "Are Pee Gee" games you've been showing me! Although I guess none of us have swords... or spikey hair... But otherwise, pretty similar!
*'''Steven''': Lapis, you're speaking my language right now!! Oh, man!! It's... another [[Peridots|Peridot]]!
*'''[[Peridots#Unleash the Light|Demantoid's Peridot]]''': Gasps! You are STEVEN!
*'''Garnet''': Steven, be careful.
*'''Amethyst''': Yeah, uh, meeting new Peridots never seems to go well for us.
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': I will now give you what you deserve...
*'''Steven''': Oh -- w-wait, there's no need for that! Let's just --
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': Take... THIS!! ...COLONY 215 OUTPOST K-3 SALUTE!
*'''Steven''': Oh?
*'''Lapis''': I-is that it?
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': I am honored to recieve you, New Leader Steven!
*'''Steven''': Oh, w-well, that's very nice, but you can just call me Steven! And I'm not really your lead--
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': The workers of this colony have diligently studied your broadcast every solar cycle! That is, until Demantoid blacklisted all channels from [[Gem Homeworld|Homeworld]]... And banned speaking of you entirely, now that I think about it... Whoops.
*'''Lapis''': Where we can find Demantoid?
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': Oh, I'm afraid that sort of knowledge greatly exceeds my position. I'm just in charge of continually pressing these buttons here.
*'''Steven''': Don't sweat it. And hang in there, Peri Pal!
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': Yes, My Steven!
*'''Steven''': This sure does look mystical and important!
*'''Lapis''': Any bets on what it actually does?
*'''Steven''': No idea! But if I know anything about magic mystery puzzles, the answer lies further ahead! Right, Garnet?
*'''Garnet''': That's right.
*'''Lapis''': Guess that answers that.
*'''Steven''': So cool!! Guys, look at this.
*'''[[Peridots#Unleash the Light|Demantoid's Peridot 2]]''': M-My Steven! I, a lowly Peridot, am underserving of this honor!!
*'''Amethyst''': Man, Steven, you really are a big time celebrity now, huh? Can I get your autograph??
*'''Lapis''': Ha, you really a celebrity now, Steven.
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 2''': I PRESENT TO YOU: MY SALUTE!!
*'''Steven''': Oh, n-no, you don't need to...
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 2''': ...
*'''Steven''': Um, at ease?
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 2''': What are your orders, My Steven?
*'''Steven''': Well, your colony is free now! So, to start with: you don't have to keep taking orders!
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 2''': B-but... then... how will I know what I'm supposed to do??
*'''Steven''': Whatever you want! As long as it's peaceful! Maybe you and the other Peridots could discuss what you want for your colony?
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 2''': I-If that's your command, My Steven!
*'''Amethyst''': Yeah, uh, I think it's gonna take awhile for them to get used to this concept, dude.
*'''Lapis''': Yeah, I'm thinking it's gonna take awhile for them to get used to this concept.
*'''[[Peridots#Unleash the Light|Demantoid's Peridot 3]]''': Grrr...
*'''Steven''': Why so glum, chum?
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 3''': First it was all those little people thing getting in my way, now it's my terminal on the fritz! Could this day get any more annoying?!
*'''Steven''': Maybe we could help?
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 3''': I mean, if you happen to have a spare f-capacitor on you, sure...
*'''Steven''': Hmmm... I'm on it!
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 3''': Oh, really? On second thought, let's make that ten capacitors.
*'''Steven''': Thanks, Warp Pad. This should work.
*'''Lapis''': Get away from my friends. You're a lifesaver.
*'''Garnet''': Thanks, Steven.
*'''Steven''': You go, Steven. I believe in me. I know you can do it. Here I go. It's, it's, it's so cool. No can do.
*'''[[Peridots#Unleash the Light|Demantoid's Peridot 4]]''': ... I am permitted to speak with you.
*'''Steven''': Why not?
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 4''': I would tell you... but that would be speaking with you.
*'''Steven''': This calls for? How about this?
*'''Amethyst''': This is the ninth thousand upgrade you know.
*'''Steven''': Can do.
*'''Lapis''': I'm doing my best.
*'''Steven''': I'm up. Sorry, guys. Okay. So now I know what knocks do.
*'''Garnet''': We're just getting started.
*'''Steven''': Peeeeeaar!!
*'''Pearl''': Hello Steven! Hello everyone!
*'''Steven''': So?? What's the skinny?
*'''Pearl''': It's just as we feared. Now that the Empire's ended and the Diamonds are no longer in charge... Gems like Pyrope and Demantoid see an opportunity to step in. And as Prism-bearers, these two might be powerful enough to do it.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': If we can just find them, I can talk to them! Show them it doesn't need to be this way. We can have all peace in Era 3!
*'''Garnet''': Don't worry, Steven. We'll get them to you. And we'll make them listen.
*'''Pearl''': Pyrope will be... resistant, to say the least. She has quite the reputation. As for Demantoid -- I actually don't know much about her. She's an [[Gem Homeworld#Era 2|Era 2]] Gem. Younger.
*'''Steven''': Then we're on the right track. If Demantoid's here on the moon, we can start with her.
*'''Lapis''': Sounds like a plan to me. Let's fish this. Girl, you've got this.
*'''Pearl''': I'll do it for them!
*'''Steven''': I know you can do it. Garnet's the coolest. You can do this. Here I go. Catch. Secrets! Let's do it to it.
*'''Lapis''': So where to?
*'''Pearl''': Let's pick up where we left off shall we?
*'''Lapis''': Get away from my friend.
*'''Pearl''': Not bad, Lapis.
*'''Garnet''': Watch this.
*'''Steven''': Don't worry. I had an extra guy. What's this doing here? Cheeseburger Backpack don't leave home without it. Item, I choose you.
*'''Lapis''': I'm sorry. I let you guys down. Hey, thanks, Steven.
*'''Steven''': I've got just the thing. Guys, how about this? Guess what time it is? Oh, I'm on to you, Super Secret Room. Yay! Stuff!
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 2''': You... you're Steven!
*'''Steven''': Sure am! Hello!
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 2''': And is that... a Prism?!
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 2''': Incredible... what I wouldn't give to get my hands on that tech. Can you imagine? A Peridot with a Prism??? Ha... ha... Ahahahahahahahaha! I am quite adept at the comedy!
*'''Lapis''': This one reminds me of a certain other [[Peridot]] I know... Oh. Are you sure? Ready when you are.
*'''Steven''': Hey, wait! We're not to bad if you get to know us... Whoa.
*'''Pearl''': Here's the [[Kindergarten]]. Demantoid could be nearby.
*'''Amethyst''': Pffftt, you call this a Kindergarten?
*'''Pearl''': Stick together, team. Let's move.
*'''Steven''': Alrighty then...
*'''Garnet''': Gems. Let's show them what we've got.
*'''Lapis''': They're no match for us.
*'''Pearl''': Okay, you light constructs... School is about to be in session! Not literally, but as a figure of speech!!!!
*'''Steven''': You guys are the best. Let's do it to it! I know where I put it in here somewhere.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Pearl''': George... have you downloaded this map from those constructs?
*'''Lapis''': Good boy, George.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Lapis''': Well, seems like Demantoid isn't here. Maybe that planet's our next stop?
*'''Steven''': Makes sense to me! Our interplanetary adventure continues!!
*'''Garnet''': Are you ready, Steven?
*'''Lapis''': Well, this place is a mess.
*'''Pearl''': It appears to be only partially colonized. A work in progress. Steven, this planet is a Demantoid conquest.
*'''Steven''': The sooner we find her, the sooner we can convince her to stand down and free her Prism. Hey! Are the light guys... building stuff? Whoops. I guess that means it's battle time. We've been a lot together, backpack.
*'''[[Bismuths#Other Bismuths|Demantoid's Bismuth]]''': Eyyy! You're that Steven guy, right??
*'''Steven''': Sure am! And you're a [[Bismuth]]!
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': Ha! You're as smart as they say! By the way, thanks for the whole "overthrowing the Diamonds" thing. If you ask me, they had it comin'. Although I've gotta tell ya, things still ain't so great on this colony. Not with all these light contructs running amok. They've completely taken over. Don't know what, but it can't be good.
*'''Steven''': Hmm...
*'''Pearl''': Hmmm...
*'''Steven''': Ooo, I bet Pearl's about to drop some interesting knowledge!
*'''Pearl''': Based on the designation written here, this planet may have been one of the Empire's most recent conquests.
*'''Steven''': I was right! This IS interesting!
*'''Pearl''': Or should I say: one of it's last, thanks to Steven's Era 3.
*'''Steven''': Yeah!
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': UGH! Can you believe this?? Building new colonies is BISMUTH work! Not something meant for these... things! And look at the lousy job they're doing! It's all so sterile! There's no life to it! It's like they always say: if you want a job done right, always hire a Bismuth!
*'''Lapis''': Good to know.
*'''Steven''': Oh, it looks like a Bismuth coming over to say something. Wait a minute! That's not A Bismuth... that's [[Bismuth (character)|Bismuth]]!
*(Bismuth arrives)
*'''Bismuth''': Fancy seeing you rocks here.
*'''Steven''': BISMUTH!!!!
*'''Garnet''': Nice of you yo join us.
*'''Pearl''': Bismuth! What are you doing here??
*'''Amethyst''': What's shakin', Bis?
*'''Bismuth''': Well, y'know, I WAS busy getting started on our special lil Earth project... But then I got your message, Steven. About everything going on with those pesky Prisms, and--
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Oh, yeah -- almost forgot! Bismuth, meet George!!
*'''Bismuth''': Well, I'll be. One of these days, Steven, you'll run out of ways to surprise me. But now it's my turn to blow some minds! Check this out.
*'''Lapis''': It's a... box.
*'''Steven''': A FANCY box!
*'''Bismuth''': Ha! This here's a one-of-a-kind Prism Containment chest! It's a little something I built during [[The Rebellion|the rebellion]]. Back when we were dealin' with Hesso--
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Bismuth''': ...ohh, uh, nobody in particular... Snatch a Prism in this baby, and you'll completely disable it. At least for a little while.
*'''Garnet''': That'll come in handy.
*'''Pearl''': This really could be our secret weapon against Pyrope and Demantoid's Prisms... but do you think it'll work?
*'''Bismuth''': Oh, you bet your facets it'll work! I never had a chance to use it, of course... But hey, if it doesn't work... I'll just give those uppercuts a lil taste of my hammer.
*'''Steven''': Wait... Bismuth! Are you saying what I think you're saying?
*'''Bismuth''': You know it, little man! C'mon! Let's get down to BISMUTH!
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': Why would they transfer all us Bismuths to a new colony, and then take us off the job? And those things replacing us -- you know they're not even Gems? Without my work, I... I don't know what I'll do.
*'''Steven''': Don't worry. The Crystal Gems are here to help!!
*'''Pearl''': Stay focused.
*'''Garnet''': Show me your moves.
*'''Lapis''': I'm ready when you are.
*'''Steven''': What's this doing here? Let's boogie.
*'''Lapis''': So where to?
*'''Pearl''': Everything I am. I'm giving on the battlefield.
*'''Steven''': Let me try this. I'm up. Easy peasy.
*'''Garnet''': For [[Rose Quartz|Rose]].
*'''Steven''': Come on, Pearl. Dance with me.
*'''Lapis''': Ready when you are.
*'''Steven''': Oh, yeah. That's a keeper.
*'''Garnet''': Are you ready, Steven?
*'''Steven''': I've got just the thing. Our space barrier adventure continues. Let's do it to it.
*'''Pearl''': Let me introduce to you to Bad Pearl. For Rose.
*'''Lapis''': I owe ya.
*'''Pearl''': It's not over.
*'''Steven''': Guess what time it is?
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': Can ya believe this? Bismuths, not building. What's next? [[Nephrites]] that don't fly?
*'''Steven''': Secrets!
*'''Garnet''': There she is.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Demantoid''': ...
*'''Steven''': Soooo, you must be Demantoid.
*'''Demantoid''': You are Steven!
*'''Steven''': Yep, that's me! Heeey, look, I know how these encounters usually go. But whaddya say we skip the whole battling part and just have a nice chat instead?
*'''Demantoid''': ...
*'''Steven''': Uh, great. Sooo, you wouldn't happen to already know about Era 3, would you?
*'''Demantoid''': I do.
*'''Steven''': Oh, perfect! Right so, the idea is that the Diamonds are no longer in charge, and --
*'''Demantoid''': It's true. The old ways of the Empire are absolute. As are the Diamonds. Old Gems ruin everything. That's why new Gems like us have to fix it.
*'''Steven''': Uh, sure... but I'm sorta getting the vibe that we're not completely on the same page...
*'''Demantoid''': We agree that a new era is needed. But we diverge on how to archieve it. Before I can rebuit it, I need to break down what is left.
*'''Steven''': Ah man, and you were off to sich a great start there...
*'''Demantoid''': You've taken [[Hessonite|Hessonite's]] Prism.
*'''George''': ...?
*'''Demantoid''': You should be aware that it won't matter. I've upgraded my Prism to reach a higher potential. Just like what I'm building here. Now I will provide you a glimpse of my Era 3.
*'''Pearl''': You're no match for the Crystal Gems.
*'''Demantoid''': Prism, engaged.
*'''Steven''': This calls for... cool. Hey, guys, how about this? One bubble coming right up. It's this the end of Steven Universe?
*(Bismuth arrives)
*'''Bismuth''': Steven, I've got the Containment Chest ready! Just gotta distract the little lump long enough to get near her Prism.
*'''Steven''': Right! On it like a bonnet!
*'''Demantoid''': ... Just embrassing.
*'''Bismuth''': Argh!
*'''Steven''': Bismuth!!
*'''Demantoid''': What rudimentary tech is this?
*'''Bismuth''': Steven, don't worry about me! You gotta get that box back!
*'''Steven''': No way, you're in trouble! Hold on, we'll save you!
*'''Bismuth''': It's fine -- I've got this! Just get the box!
*'''Lapis''': Steven, what do we do??
*'''Garnet''': Steven, we must move quickly!
*'''Demantoid''': Hm.
*'''Bismuth''': Steven, the box.
*(Demantoid's Bismuths arrives)
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': 'Ey!! Demantoid! We need to have a lil chat.
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 2''': Yeah! We got some ideas to discuss. 'Bout a lil thing called workers rights.
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 3''': C'mon Bismuths. Magic triangle or not, there's only one of her and tons of us!
*'''Bismuth''': Now we're in Bismuth.
*'''Demantoid''': Hm.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Lapis''': Welp, there goes that box.
*'''Bismuth''': That ain't good. Without the Containment Chest, we're seriously outmatched by two Prisms.
*'''Steven''': I'm sorry, Bismuth...
*'''Bismuth''': Ah, what the heck. Who doesn't love an underdog story, am I right? And thanks for saving me, Steven? Don't look so down. Here's a little something to perk you up.
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': So... I guess Demantoid's really gone...
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 2''': Yeah, now what? Who's in charge?
*'''Steven''': That's up to you guys! You can choose your own leader and your own rules! You can hold a fair election!
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 3''': Wow. That-- that all sounds great!
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': Yeah!
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 2''': Thanks, Steven! And Earth Gems!
*'''Lapis''': Soooo where to from here?
*'''Steven''': That's.. a very good question. If I were a Demantoid, where I would go next...
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': Maybe [[Gem Homeworld/Locations#Pyrope's World (Blue 4)|Colony 4]]?
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 3''': You mean [[Gem Homeworld/Locations#Yellow 4|Yellow 4]]?
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': No no, Blue 4. Yellow 4 was obliterated by that black hole, remember?
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 3''': Oh, right. Shame.
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': I overheard Demantoid going on 'bout Blue Colony 4. Seems we 'sposed to transfer there for some work, before all those light guys showed up.
*'''Lapis''': Well, I'd call that a lead.
*'''Steven''': Thanks, Bismuths! Oh, yeah. That's a keeper.
*'''Garnet''': Blue Diamond Colony 4. This colony is very...
*'''Amethyst''': Old?
*'''Garnet''': Yup. Pyrope is ruled this planet. Though she is not currently here. She's still holed up back at the palace of hers.
*'''Steven''': Hm. Even if Pyrope and Demantoid aren't here, maybe we can gather more information about them? And we can keep spreading the word about Era 3 -- that all Gems are now liberated and free! Oh -- and we can can also help keep all the Gems on this colony safe from the light constructs! Oh, oh! And also collect more rainbow keys!!
*'''Pearl''': Ha, ha, alright, Steven. One thing at a time.
*'''Steven''': Hello there!
*'''[[Jades#Unleash the Light|Pyrope's Jade]]''': Oh my, you must be an off-wonder... We haven't had an off-wonder in, oh, one thousand three hundred and forty eight years. Not that I'm keeping count.
*'''Steven''': Wow, really? That's a long time...
*'''Amethyst''': Huh. Steven, I don't think this Gem recognizes you. Hey, you... haven't you seen Steven's Homeworld broadcasts?
*'''Pyrope's Jade''': Oh my stars, no. We are not permitted to recieve transmissions from Homeworld. Or anywhere else.
*'''Amethyst''': Yeah, that ain't good. I've got this, P.
*'''Pearl''': Wait for it. Hey.
*'''Steven''': I've got just the thing. Ite, I've choose you? How about? Do your thing, thing.
*'''Pearl''': And? There. Stay on target. Ha, ha.
*'''Garnet''': Thanks, Steven.
*'''Steven''': You can do this.
*'''[[Jades#Unleash the Light|Pyrope's Jade 2]]''': Please, leave me be. The constructs will see me speaking with an outsider...
*'''Steven''': Hmmm. I don't like what I'm hearing. Not one bit.
*'''Pearl''': Oh, thanks, Steven.
*'''Steven''': Next stop more adventure.
*'''Pearl''': Let's get to work, Gems. Just need perfect opening. Wait for it. There. Thank you, Steven. Let's go, [[Rainbow Quartz 2.0|Rainbow 2.0]]. Let's see them stand against this.
*'''Amethyst''': Yeah, I've met to that happen.
*'''Steven''': No can do. One bubble coming right up.
*'''Lapis''': Leave this to me. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. Let's fish this.
*'''Pearl''': Stay focused. So, this is the place of light, huh? It's certainly fancy.
*'''Lapis''': Hey thanks, Steven.
*'''Steven''': Bubble time. You've gotta love yourself.
*'''Pearl''': More locked doors? Well, that's just great.
*'''Hessonite''': It's okay, Pearl! We're key-finding-pros! It'll be easy-peasy!
*'''Pearl''': At least your optimism makes this sort of thing more bearable, Steven.
*'''Hessonite''': (off-screen) Hm hm hm hm!
*'''Lapis''': Wait... did you guys hear something?
*'''Pearl''': That laugh... It sounds like...
*(Hessonite arrives)
*'''Hessonite''': Greetings, Crystal Gems!
*'''Pearl''': It can't be...
*'''Steven''': No way...
*'''Hessonite''': Fear not! I, your intriguing new companion, have come to after my invaluable assistance! Waste not your energy deducing my identity! For none are able to discover my rue name...
*'''Steven''': HESSONITE?!
*'''Hessonite''': I--- urm...
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Oh, George! It's okay! We won't let anything happen to you.
*'''Hessonite''': HA! You think *I* could possibly be the Great Hessonite?? If only I could be as brilliant, strong, dashing, and incredibly humble as the Legendary Hero Hessonite! Ha ha ha ha ha! You are quite adept at the comedy! So funny.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Amethyst''': Uh, tell me she's joking.
*'''Garnet''': This is no laughing matter. You still need to answer for --
*'''Hessonite''': Answers, yes! You seek answers. Of course you do! Be amazed, Crystal Gems! For I, your ambigous ally, shall now reveal the very anaswer you seek! To unlock the puzzle of the rainbow barrier and proceed deeper into the Palace of the Light, you must... Are you ready? You may want to hot this down. You must... obtain a rainbow key!
*'''Amethyst''': ...
*'''Steven''': ...
*'''Hessonite''': Yes, yes. I know this revelation solves everything for you. You're welcome! And with that -- we shall meet again!
*'''Amethyst''': Uuuugh! We knew that already!!
*'''Lapis''': What was *that* about?
*'''Pearl''': I wondered when we'd see her again. But I didn't quite anticipate... that.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': You heard what she said, George. She wasn't Hessonite at all... totally someone else...
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Maybe we should avoid talking about Hess altogether. C'mon... On that note: we've got more keys to find. What's this doing here?
*'''Pearl''': Everything I am. I give on the battlefield.
*'''Steven''': Guys, look at this.
*'''Lapis''': Hey. Sure, I'll take it.
*'''Pearl''': Let's picked where we left off shall we?
*'''Garnet''': This place gives me a hippie geez.
*'''Lapis''': Let me handle this.
*'''Steven''': Let's try this. Sorry. Catch.
*'''Pearl''': Just what I needed.
*'''Steven''': Do your thing, thing.
*'''Lapis''': I'm okay. Really.
*'''Steven''': Here I go. Catch. You go, Steven. Got it.
*'''Pearl''': Everything I am. I give ons the battlefield.
*'''Steven''': Now, that's what I called loot. What if I could?
*'''Pyrope''': Oh my my my, what is this! Such sneaky uninvited guests!
*'''Steven''': Pyrope, listen to me! I'm Steven and --
*'''Pyrope''': Yes yes, I know who you are. I had hoped you'd take the hint when we closed the door. But you're a persistent little one, aren't you? Although, I must admit. It's much more fun this way. Oh yes. I'll be watching you... Tee hee hee!
*'''Pearl''': Oh I defintely won't be getting along with her.
*'''Bismuth''': Yeah, not a fan of her type.
*'''Steven''': Just another day at the office. So... I guess we'll just keep going then.
*'''Garnet''': Are you ready, Steven?
*'''Steven''': I'm gonan go with this.
*'''Pearl''': Whoopsy daisy.
*'''Lapis''': You're a life saver.
*'''Bismuth''': Lapis, take five. Open for bismuth. Here we go.
*'''Lapis''': I'm sorry. I let you guys down.
*'''Steven''': It's, it's so cool! Yay, stuff!
*'''Garnet''': I'm stronger than you.
*'''Lapis''': Just what I needed.
*'''Garnet''': Thanks, Steven.
*'''Steven''': Don't worry. I'm here.
*(Hessonite arrives)
*'''Hessonite''': Oh, Crystal Ge~emms~~
*'''Lapis''': Oh boy, here we go again.
*'''George''': ???
*'''Steven''': Sshhh, George, it's nothing. Go back to sleep.
*'''Hessonite''': BEHOLD! Your icognito idol here returned!
*'''Steven''': Are you here to help us again?
*'''Hessonite''': But of course! Aren't you Gems so lucky. This time, I come bearing a gift that shall greatly aide your quest. It is --
*'''Pyrope''': Tee hee hee!
*'''Hessonite''': Oh goodie.
*'''Pyrope''': My, my, what do we have here? Do you sneaky little gems make a new friend? Quaint! But ultimately pointless. It matters not how many allies you add to your little posse. Tee hee hee hee!
*'''Hessonite''': Oh, just let her droll on. Before long something shiny will distract her.
*'''Pyrope''': Did you know this palace once resided on Blue Diamond's Colony 4? I had it relocated once the semi-precious stones moved their living quarters too close to the outer gates. Just filthy. I do say they were quite distressed, you know. To have their beloved Pyrope rule from a whole world away.
*'''Hessonite''': Any moment now.
*'''Pyrope''': But it can't be helped. You see-- What's this? An unviewved message on channel 3? Oh, bother.
*'''Hessonite''': There we are. Now where was I?
*'''Steven''': Um, something about the gift?
*'''Hessonite''': Oh! That's right! A gift imperative to your quest! It is... Right over there. In that treasure chest. Ta ta.
*(Hessonite jumps away)
*'''Bismuth''': I'm just... not even gonna bother saying what we're all thinking.
*'''Garnet''': Steven, look out!
*'''Lapis''': Better late and never.
*'''Steven''': I know I put in here somewhere. I'm gonna go with this.
*(Hessonite arrives)
*'''Hessonite''': You're in luck, Crystal Gems...
*'''Lapis''': Uh huh...
*'''Hessonite''': Your favorite covert companion is here with a tip so amazing, you'll just want to shatter! You may want to sit down for this. It's --
*'''Pyrope''': Tee hee heeee!
*'''Hessonite''': Ugh, you've got to be kidding!
*'''Pyrope''': You're all still here! What a surprising.
*'''Hessonite''': Yes, well, we're fine here, Pyrope. Why don't you go back to--
*'''Demantoid''': They're already here...
*'''Hessonite''': Demantoid, please the adults are talking.
*'''Pyrope''': Oh ho ho! This one's certainly dharp the facets.
*'''Demantoid''': (Sighs) You're aware that Hes--
*'''Pyrope''': Who is that Gem, anyway? I like her sparkle!
*'''Demantoid''': (Sighs) We need to prepare. Let's take this offline.
*'''Pyrope''': Oh, but they're so fun to watch! Though I suppose they'll be shattered soon anyway.
*'''Hessonite''': I swear these two are going to be the end of me. Now, where were we. Ah, yes! My incredible revelation! Are you ready?
*'''Lapis''': Yes. Yes we are.
*'''Hessonite''': During the Rebellion, there were rumors the Crystal Gems created a mighty weapon to contain the Prisms... Supposedly it was some sort of powerful... box. If you find that... you might be able to stop them.
*'''Bismuth''': You don't say.
*'''Steven''': Cooool... good to know... I-is that it?
*'''Hessonite''': No need to thank me! Bye bye!
*(Hessonite jumps away)
*'''Bismuth''': What can I do you for? Nice.
*'''Steven''': Hey.
*'''Lapis''': Steven! Okay, that hurt.
*'''Bismuth''': Here this would work.
*'''Steven''': Everything's gonna be different.
*'''Bismuth''': Can I fix it? You bet I can. Ooh. This will charge some heads.
*'''Steven''': Let's use an item. Game over for me.
*'''Garnet''': Just a scratch.
*'''Lapis''': Garnet, anytime. Garnet, let me try.
*'''Steven''': Let's see. Should I try a new badge? Maybe a lot of new upgrades?
*'''Lapis''': Hey.
*'''Garnet''': This is Garnet. Back together. I'll take it.
*'''Bismuth''': Here I go.
*'''Steven''': Let's try this.
*'''Lapis''': Let me handle this.
*'''Steven''': Garnet's the coolest. I know you can do it. It's this the end of Steven Universe? I can do this.
*'''Garnet''': This is Garnet. Back together.
*'''Bismuth''': Back in bismuth.
*'''Steven'''': It's... It's so cool. Hey, it's my page.
*'''Garnet''': I will fight for a place when I'm free.
*'''Bismuth''': Did you "bis" miss me?
*'''Steven''': We can do this. Together.
*'''Pyrope''': Oh my. You've really made it all the way here. Well, come on over. Let me have a look at you. Did you enjoy the Palace? How did you find out hospitality? You've quite lucky, you know. My Gems, they'd dissipate their forms for a chance to stroll these halls again. And who could blame them? They love me so much. As does my Prism. As do all Gems!
*'''Bismuth''': Wow. This one might just be the crustiest of the uppercuts.
*'''Garnet''': You are delusional.
*'''Pyrope''': (Sighs) Yes, yes, they all adore their perfect Pyrope. You see, it's why I couldn't even following these little rules of yours, Steven. Gems need a ruler, they're lost without one. That's just how Gems are. If not the Diamonds, why not someone already so beloved? And a Prism-bearer, at that! It's as if I was made for this. And Demantoid, she's part of this too I suppose. But with that winning personality, who would follow her? Even with all those big ideas and fancy technology, she knew it would take my legions of loyal subjects to pull off our coup.
*'''Lapis''': Are you done yet?
*'''Steven''': Pyrope, it's not too late for you to set things right. Stand down and release your Prism. There can still be a place for you in Era 3!
*'''Pyrope''': Tee hee! You don't understand, dear. I'm a Garnet. A Prism-bearer. I've held my colony strong for thousands for years. And most important of all. I was made perfect in every way. Ever since the day I came out that wall. As you can see, there's just so many reasons why they all love me. If you think you can stand against all of that, well you're wrong.
*'''Bismuth''': Finally, now that all that chit chat's outta the way...
*'''Pyrope''': You know, you really have been quite the unruly houseguests. Oh, Prism! I think it's time we see our guests out.
*'''Bismuth''': Let's show her that Crystal Gems means business.
*'''Pyrope''': No, no.
*'''Bismuth''': This one ready to roll.
*'''Garnet''': Good job, Steven.
*'''Lapis''': Okay, that hurt.
*'''Steven''': How about? Here you go.
*'''Pyrope''': Such fun. Prism, take care of these unwanted guests.
*'''Bismuth''': Pssst, Steven! The containment chest is over there!! If I can just get to it, this time I --
*(Demantoid arrives)
*'''Pyrope''': There you are! About time you finally joined us. What were you doing, anyhow? You little Prism tinkerin' again?
*'''Demantoid''': ... You've made a mistake.
*'''Pyrope''': What's that?? Speak up for once!
*'''Demantoid''': Same mistake you always make. You underestimated them.
*'''Pyrope''': Oh, well you're just so helpful as always, Demantoid. Can we not do this now?
*'''Hessonite''': (off-screen) She's right you know.
*'''Demantoid''': What?
*(Hessonite arrives)
*'''Hessonite''': They're much stronger than you could ever know. And I, ever so fabulous and alluring mystery hero, stand with them! You silly Garnets are all washed up.
*'''Pyrope''': Hmm. Are we now? You know it's already quite rude to be an uninvited guest. But to also hide your face... It just won't do. HESSONITE?! What!! H-how can this be!!
*'''Demantoid''': You really didn't know?
*'''Hessonite''': Yes, it is true! It was I, the great Hessonite, all along!! I single-handedly orchestrated the Crystal Gem's success, all while remaining completely incognito! As we all know, the old Hessonite knew nothing but constant fame and glory! But this is the new me! That's right -- I once was the greatest war hero Gem of all time. And now... I AM THE MOST HUMBLE GEM OF ALL TIME!
*'''Demantoid''': Sigh.
*'''Pyrope''': This is just absurd! Even for you! Though I suppose that finally explains what this Steven is doing with your Prism.
*'''Hessonite''': Why yes, I liberated my prism even before Steven's decree. You know how I'm always ahead of the curve. Try not to be jealous, Pyrope. It doesn't suit you.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Hessonite''': Oh, Prism... You needn't be alarmed by me anymore...
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': George! It's okay!
*'''Demantoid''': You can still join us.
*'''Hessonite''': Hm hm hm hm! Don't you realize I'm already on the winning side?
*'''Demantoid''': I'm not talking to you.
*'''Hessonite''': What...
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': George, no!! Let go of him!
*'''Hessonite''': How dare you!!
*'''Pyrope''': Tee hee hee hee! All three Prisms together again! Just as it should be.
*'''Demantoid''': Let us usher in the New Empire.
*'''Garnet''': This is it, team.
*'''Steven''': We'll save you, George.
*'''Lapis''': Stay away from my friends.
*'''Bismuth''': Open for bismuth. Here we go.
*'''Steven''': Bubble time!
*'''Bismuth'''': This will pack a punch.
*'''Steven''': I know I put it in here somewhere.
*'''Hessonite''': Steven, how know now I don't like losing. We're going to need a new strategy if we hope to finish this.
*'''Steven''': If we can just get George out of there... it might uniform the monster! GEORGE! I know you're still in there!
*'''George''': ???
*'''Bismuth''': It heard you, Steven. Quick, try again!
*'''Steven''': George, think about everything we've been through!
*'''George''': ???...
*'''Steven''': Think about all the amazing work you've done on yourself! You've come so far!
*'''George''': ...
*'''Lapis''': It's working...
*'''Steven''': George, you don't have to--
*'''Demantoid''': ...
*'''Steven''': Mmmff! Mmff!
*'''Lapis''': Steven!
*'''Hessonite''': Prism!
*'''George''': ...?
*'''Hessonite''': I've been watching you from afar this whole time. What Steven taught you... it's the same thing he taught me. We don't have to do terrible things we were made for. I know I held you back from that for so long. I'm sorry. Don't fall back into that form, Prism! This isn't you. Not anymore. You're... George!
*'''George''': !
*'''Demantoid''': No! Don't listen to her!! You are where you belong! You are complete!
*'''Pyrope''': ...
*'''Steven''': George! You were great, little buddy! And you too, Hessonite. Not too shabby.
*'''Hessonite''': But of course, winning is what I do, you know, and -- I mean, thank you, Steven.
*'''Pyrope''': Fine, have your inferior Prism back! We don't need it! We still have two! Prisms, attack! Demantoid, t-tell them!
*'''Demantoid''': I'm done taking orders from you. You're obsolete.
*'''Pyrope''': What are you talking about?? This is clearly not the time for your Era 2 rebelliousness!
*'''Demantoid''': No!!! My Prism!!! My modified limb enhancers!!
*'''Pyrope''': Well, you deserve it! This is all your fault, after all!
*'''Demantoid''': MY fault?! You're the one who just sat here in your room the entire time! Like you always do!! While I do all the work!
*'''Pyrope''': Oh! You tiny, tiny excuse for a Gem! I'll have you know that --
*'''Demantoid''': Argh!!!
*'''Lapis''': Well, I guess that's that.
*'''Garnet''': Pitiful. And they call themselves Garnets.
*'''Amethyst''': I don't know if you guys noticed, but pretty sure we just won.
*'''Hessonite''': (Laughs) Well, Crystal Gems, I'll be sticking around. Might as well make some changes around here. Maybe even open this ridiculous palace back up to Gemkind. And worry not. I'll be sure to look after these too. Who knows, perhaps one day they can become as enlightened, heroic, and humble as I have. After all. Seems like anything's possible in your Era 3, Steven.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Bismuth''': Oh? You want me to?...
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Hooray! You're all free!
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Aw, shucks. It isn't all thanks to me! You had to make those choices on your own, George! Maybe you can teach these two all about it!
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Oh yeah... I think you're right. You are home! I'm gonna miss adventuring with you, George.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Hey, anytime you wanna visit again -- I'm just a few warps away! Next time you come by, maybe I can show you that RPG I was telling you about. Now that I think about it... I never did beat that game!
*'''Pearl''': Steven, don't forget... There's still colonies we'll need to check in on if we want to ensure every Gem's planet's been liberated.
*'''Steven''': Oh yeah! Guess there's still more work to do. Are you guys... still up for more?
*'''Garnet''': Always.
*'''Amethyst''': You know I'm in!
*'''Bismuth''': Me too! Just lead the way.
*'''Lapis''': Sure. Where to next?
*'''Pearl''': Proud of you, Steven. Let's do it.
*'''Steven''': Crystal Gems... let's go save the day!
*'''Squaridot''': (Laughs)
*'''Steven''': Huh? What's wrong, little buddy?
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Amethyst''': Um... that's some freaky stuff right there.
*'''Bismuth''': I'm not liking the look of this.
*'''Steven''': Hmm. Is that... Is that some kind of distress signal? But it's all scrambled and wonky! Where's it coming from??
*'''Amethyst''': Heeeeyyyyy, I know that place! It's, uh... y'know, the one with all those letters and numbers...
*'''Bismuth''': CSC-215...
*'''Amethyst''': Uh, yeah, that's what I was saying.
*'''Steven''': Huh so, maybe that's where we can find out more about this message?
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Yeah. Sounds like a plan to me!
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Steven''': Okay, keep going this way, then?
*'''Amethyst''': Pffft, this place is two thousand and late.
*'''Bismuth''': Let's stay focused. New constructs may have arrived since we were last here.
*'''Lapis''': Hey, [[Peridot]].
*'''Steven''': PERIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!
*'''Peridot''': Steven?? ...and everyone else! W-what are you all doing here?
*'''Amethyst''': Duh, we're on a magic mission to liberate the galaxy. What are YOU doing here?
*'''Peridot''': W-well, you see, I'm just here... to...
*'''Steven''': Oh, are you tracking the distress signal too??
*'''Peridot''': YES! Yes, that! Exactly that! Definitely the thing you just said!
*'''Steven''': Is everything okay, Peridot? You're acting--
*'''Peridot''': Pro-active?? Why yes, you could say that!
*'''Steven''': Hmmm, in that case... Care to join to us?
*'''Peridot''': Yes! Why, I thought you'd never ask! You might want to stay back for this. Let's go, fellow Crystal Gems!
*'''Steven''': Oh, yeah. Ooo, I almost forgot! Peridot, you remember the Prism? Allow me to introduce: George!
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Peridot''': Oh my stars! Oh, wow, it's back! Um, greetings, George Prism.
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Peridot''': Wow. That unconventional new form! Prism Tech has done it again!! So fascinating. Y'know, if I could just take a closer look at --
*'''Bismuth''': Peridot, we've got to keep moving.
*'''Peridot''': ...
*(Amethyst, Garnet and Pearl arrives)
*'''Peridot''': Ah HA! I can use this terminal to decode the message! Give me a moment to bypass their security, and... You've got to be kidding. THAT'S the protocol they went with? HA!! Perhaps I should stick around after the mission, show these Peridots a thing or--
*'''Steven''': So...
*'''Peridot''': Right, where we are.
*'''[[Peridot (Squaridot)|Squaridot]]''': THIS TRANSMISSION IS FOR... ...THE STEVEN.
*'''Steven''': What? Gasp!
*'''Squaridot''': I COMMAND YOU TO DELIVER THE PRISM TO ME. THIS IS A NON-OPTIONAL DEMAND. YOU WILL FULFILL it with... EXTREME PROMPTNESS! YOU WILL DO THIS. OR... ELSE! ... ...that is the entirely of this broadcast.
*'''Lapis''': That was a pretty non-specific ultimatum.
*'''Steven''': You guys... that was SQUARIDOT!
*'''Peridot''': ...
*'''Steven''': Um, Peridot? Did you hear me? I said... that was SQUARIDOT! Remember her? You guys met at the Barn, and then --
*'''Peridot''': Uh, yes, w-well...
*'''Amethyst''': Um, wait, wait. Last time we saw her, wasn't she in a bubble?
*'''Peridot''': Uh huh...
*'''Steven''': Huh, that's right. How did she --
*'''Peridot''': ...uh, um, I have a confession to make... ... ... IT WAS ME!!!!!!!!!!!
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Peridot''': I let her out! I thought, surely I could get her on our side! On my own... I thought it'd be like when you released me! But you would NOT believe how difficult she can be! The EGO! Just completely self-absorbed! How do you even reason with someone like that?!
*'''Pearl''': Peridot! Why didn't you contact us?
*'''Peridot''': W-well, you guys were busy!! And I've been tracking her, and I thought I could still clean this up myself, and, and... ...and telling you now, so... I... I... I'm sorry.
*'''Steven''': It's okay, Peridot. But next time you've gotta trust us to help.
*'''Peridot''': I know. You're right.
*'''Bismuth''': Squaridot, huh. So we know this is probably a trap, right?
*'''Garnet''': Yup.
*'''Steven''': Maybe there's still a way to get through to her. What if she hasn't heard about Era 3? We've gotta at least try.
*'''Peridot''': Well, at least she made it easy for us. There's coordinates included the message. And a hologram of a ship. Look!
*'''Steven''': What? Hey, that's Hessonite's warship! Luckily for us, I happen to know one magical pink lion who can take us there.
*'''Peridot''': Well, what are we waiting for? I'm ready when you guys are! Oh, yeah. It's Peri time. This ship is massive. I hope everyone's ready for a walk.
*'''Lapis''': Yep. Let's do this.
*'''Bismuth''': Hey! Who turned off the lights?
*'''Peridot''': That wasn't a malfunction. Possibly a rerouting of the ship's power. Hm. What IS that Squaroclod planning...
*'''Lapis''': So, where to?
*'''Squaridot''': THERE YOU ARE, THE STEVEN! YOU WILL NOW DELIVER THE PRISM TO ME!
*'''Peridot''': Uh, yeah, you told us that already.
*'''Steven''': Squaridot, good to see ya! Heyy, so, while have you here... Have you heard about a little something called Era 3?
*'''Squaridot''': NO.
*'''Steven''': Oh, boy. Hm. This might be tougher than I thought.
*'''Peridot''': See??? Everyone, look!!! I found her!
*'''George''': (Gibberish Speaking)
*'''Squaribot''': The Prism. Relinquish it to me.
*'''Steven''': First of all, I can't do that. Hmm. And second of all, you look... different?
*'''Squaribot''': That observation is... not relevant! Let us battle, you... [[Pebbles|PEBBLES]]!
*'''Steven''': No! Ahhhh!!! We exploded Squaridot!! Oh. Wait! Squaridots shouldn't be explode-able!
*'''Squaridot''': YOU WILL NOW DELIVER THE PRISM TO ME.
*'''Steven''': Uh. Huh... Wait a minute. Was that not the real Squaridot? Was it just a... SquariBOT??
*'''Peridot''': I have absolutely no idea what's going on anymore.
*'''Squaridot''': THE PRISM! I MUST HAVE IT... BACK!
*'''Peridot''': This must be the computer running Hessonite's ship! Leave it to me, teammates!!! I'll just remote access the system and shut it down. Simple! Aren't you all glad I came along?? Now I just need you guys to but me some time.
*'''Lapis''': Let's finish this. You heard her. Let's get to work.
*'''Peridot''': GOT IT! I'm in!! Now, just to shut down this pesky program! And... NYAH!
*'''Squaridot''': What... just happened?
*'''Steven''': Hoo boy, where to begin?
*'''Peridot''': Listen here, you!! No running off this time! You've got some explaining to do!
*'''Squaridot''': I was searching for the whereabouts of my commander... The ship has an emergency protocol for locating the Prism. I thought that would lead me to her. I activated it, and then... The ship took over. It looked into the deepest parts of me... and extracted what it needed.
*'''Lapis''': What? That's terrible...
*'''Squaridot''': Long ago, before the Prism was lost, the ship would interface with it directly. It's as if the ship couldn't exist without it. Just like my commander...
*'''Steven''': Well, the important thing is that it's all over now! And you're okay!
*'''Peridot''': Thanks to us!! The Crystal Gems!! Well, whaddya say to that? Perhaps you'd like to thank us for saving you??
*'''Squaridot''': ... I... suppose... to show my gratitude, I can refrain from reporting your presence to Hessonite. Or the Diamond Authority.
*'''Peridot''': Hessonite? The Diamonds?? Uh... do you really not know??
*'''Squaridot''': Know... what?
*'''Steven''': Sounds like we've got a few things to catch you up on. So, uh, yeah. I know all that stuff I just explained was a lot to take in. Um, any questions?
*'''Squaridot''': I'm... still processing it.
*'''Steven''': Hey, I know! Squaridot! How'd you like to tag along with us?? Oh! You could come back down to Beach City! We could show you the project we're working on! I think you'd liiiiiike it! Whaddya say?
*'''Squaridot''': Um, yeeeahh, um... I don't think I'm ready for all that yet.
*'''Steven''': If you change your mind, you know where to find us. Cool, well... Square ya later!
*'''Squaridot''': Right...
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 2''': Work, work...
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': It's... you... I worshipped my Diamond. But she submitted to you. Now... What am I supposed to do?
*'''Steven''': Dance Party!
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': ...what?
*'''Steven''': Urm, what I mean to say is: now you can do ANYTHING! You can have fun, or be creative! I want you, and all the other Peri Pals, to be free! To live your lives the way YOU want!
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': Be... free... I... I will try.
*'''Pearl''': You're really doing an amazing thing, Steven.
*'''Demantoid's Peridot 4''': Argh! These pesky constructs! I knowwe're supposed to stay out of their way... I know the Prism is something to be respected and feared... But they're in the way and I've got SO much work to do!! Hey... if you, y'know, just so happen to clear out a few... I could keep it between us. Just sayin'...
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': You look familiar... Where have I seen you before?
*'''Steven''': I just have one of those faces, I 'spose!
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': Right... Well, since you're just standing around with no discernible purpose, I can only conclude that you're in need of assignment. Currently I am cataloguing Demantoid's new light constructs. There's nothing more important than comprehensive data, you know. I've modified this fauna scanning device for just that purpose. Here, take it. You can aide me by scanning five different light construct types. Report back to me when you've completed your assignment.
*'''Pearl''': Wait, steven, what are we agreeing to exactly?
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': Oh?? You wish to converse with me again, New Leader Steven?? Then I must honor you once again with our humble colony's special salute!!
*'''Steven''': Oh, n-no, that won't be necessar--
*'''Demantoid's Planet''': SAAAAALUUUTE!!!!!
*'''Steven''': Oh, um, that looks really great! Thanks...
*'''Demantoid's Planet''': Hey! There seems to be fewer light constructs getting in my way lately. You do good work! Here, take this for your trouble.
*'''Steven''': Hey, Peri Pal! We did the thing!
*'''Demantoid's Peridot''': That you did. Yes, yes, this data looks to be most adequate. I suppose I should reward you for your efforts.
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': Everyone's been gettin' real upset 'bout all this Demantoid and construct stuff. But I know better. I'm keepin' my head low. Biding my time working on a special project. It's a list of all things that can be forged using the local ore. Wanna see? Maybe you could help me finish that list? If you're not doing anything more important, I mean.
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 2''': ARGH!!!!!
*'''Steven''': Uh... hey, friend! Perhaps we can be of assistance?
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 2''': Oh? If you wanna help, answer me this... You know what Bismuths can build, right???
*'''Steven''': Oh, uh, yeah... urm... this isn't a trick question, right? Um...they can build... anything?
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 2''': THAT'S RIGHT! ANYTHING Bismuth's can build ANYTHING!! So why can't I make heads or tails of this here schematic I found?! GRRR!! It's useless. Here, you might as well have it!
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth''': Huh? You finished that list? Wow. I'm impressed. Thanks fo rletting me know.
*'''Steven''': Ta daaaaa~~!
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 2''': WHAAA! H-how did you...
*'''Steven''': Anything's possible with a positive attitude! 
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 2''': It's that so. Well, this thing you made... it's useless y'know. 
*'''Steven''': Oh.
*'''Demantoid's Bismuth 2''': But... I admire your spirit. Here, you deserve this.
