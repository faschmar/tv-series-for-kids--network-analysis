{{TD|Pearl | Let us... begin!}}
{{TD||(''The fight begins. Holo-Pearl attacks first, and the duelists exchanges offenses and defenses. Holo-Pearl unleashes a flurry of attacks until Stevonnie jumps over it and begins floating to a nearby pillar.'')}}

{{TD|Steven| That doesn't sound like you. What happened?}}
{{TD|Connie | ... I beat someone up.}}
{{TD|Steven| What?!}}
{{TD|Connie | A kid I didn't know. He just bumped into me in the hallway. I was so startled, my training instincts kicked in. I just... reacted. I was so embarrassed, I just ran away.}}
{{TD|Steven| But you didn't mean to hurt him! *sighs* I know what it's like... Sometimes, you hurt people... by accident..? Y-you just have to try not to think about it.}}

{{TD||(''Garnet brings Steven and Connie to the beach, and they sit down, facing each other.'')}}
{{TD|Garnet | For a fusion to work, there needs to be balance. An imbalance can cause your fusion to lose touch with reality, see things that aren't there, and eventually fall apart. That is to say, if one of you is falling apart, your fusion will as well. To find balance, you must understand your feelings. To understand your feelings, you must see them clearly without running from them.}}
{{TD|Connie | See them clearly?}}
{{TD|Garnet | I'll show you, but first, we need Stevonnie.}}
