{{TD||(''Steven and Greg look up and find themselves in a room full of several Quartz guards, laughing at them intimidatingly.'')}}
{{TD|[[Amethyst]]|Steven! Greg!}}
{{TD||(''The Quartz guards step to the sides, revealing Amethyst being hold down by an Amethyst guard.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*groaning* They found me out!}}
{{TD|[[Steven]]|Amethyst!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|You won't believe what I've been through. These Amethysts, they're really, really... ''great''!}}
{{TD|Steven|What?!}}
{{TD||(''Amethyst and the Quartz guards begin laughing aloud altogether.'')}}
{{TD|Amethyst 1|*laughing* Your faces!}}
{{TD|Amethyst 2|lets go of Amethyst* You were right! That was priceless!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|*runs over and hugs Steven* I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I had to! *chuckles* What are you wearing? Greg! This is a good look for you.}}
{{TD|Steven|What is going on?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|These Amethysts, they're all from [[Earth]]! They're from the [[Prime Kindergarten]]! Wait! Hey, 8XL!}}
{{TD|[[The Famethyst#8XL|8XL]]|Yeah?}}
{{TD|Amethyst|You guys, I'm an 8! Tell 'em. Tell 'em!}}
{{TD|8XL|The Amethyst under me never popped out! We're all waiting, and- pfft- nothing.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|I'm 8XM! Facet-5, Cut-8XM- that's ''me''! This is [[The Famethyst#8XG|8XG]], this is [[The Famethyst#8XH|8XH]].}}
{{TD|[[The Famethyst#8XJ|8XJ]]|I'm J.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Ah, geez! Sorry! I'm worse than Holly Blue!}}
{{TD|8XJ|Aren't we all?}}

{{TD|[[Skinny]]|Prime, prime, prime. You Amethysts are so cliquey.}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Skinny's a Jasper! There are Gems here from the [[Beta Kindergarten]], too! Hey, where's Carnelian?}}
{{TD|Skinny|Celebrating.}}
{{TD|[[Carnelian]]|I'm not the shortest anymore!}}
{{TD||(''Carnelian lifts Amethyst up and runs around the room with her, while they both laugh.'')}}
{{TD|[[Greg]]|This is unreal.}}
{{TD|Steven|Hey! Please, if you don't mind me asking, we really need your help. We came in with [[Sapphire]], [[Ruby]], and [[Pearl]]. We've gotta find them and get them out of-}}
{{TD||(''The door into the room behind Steven suddenly opens up, revealing Holly Blue, Sapphire, Ruby and Pearl standing in the doorway, and Steven and Greg quickly run away to hide.'')}}
{{TD|[[Holly Blue Agate|Holly Blue]]|I'll only be a moment.}}
{{TD||(''Holly Blue enters the room, and the Quartz guards all stand in attention, as Steven and Greg hide behind one of them.'')}}
{{TD|Holly Blue|What are you all doing in here?! Get to your stations! Even you hideous off-color Betas! Get out of your cubbies and into your places! It's the least you can do for the Diamond that kept you worthless sorry [[Gems]] in service! That's right. Blue is back already! Now go pretend your filthy vein of Quartz is capable of ''gratitude''! Go, go, go!}}
{{TD||(''The Quartz guards begin running out of the room, with Steven and Greg sneaking behind their backs.'')}}
{{TD|Holly Blue|Disperse! My Diamond is waiting!}}
{{TD|Amethyst|Run! Just run! I'll find you! Go!}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Greg run off, leaving Amethyst behind with the Quartz guards. They enter dimly-lit room, as the door closes behind them, and look up, spotting [[Gem Bubbles|bubbles]] of Quartz gems floating in the ceiling.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Who [[Bubbling|bubbled]] all these Gems?}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Greg peek from behind a pillar, seeing thousands of bubbled Quartz floating all around the room.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Wow! It's kind of like a birthday party in here.}}
{{TD||(''Steven then notices he is beginning to tear up and he gasps in shock.'')}}
{{TD|Steven| Oh, no! We gotta hide!}}
{{TD|Greg|Huh?}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Greg hides behind the pillar, when Blue Diamond enters the room.'')}}
{{TD|[[Blue Diamond]]|Pearl, close the door. *sighs*}}
{{TD||(''Blue Diamond kneels down in the room, removes her hood and begins to tear up. The door opens again, as Yellow Diamond enters as well.'')}}
{{TD|[[Yellow Diamond]]|Please tell me you're joking. You only just left, and you're already back?}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|Yellow! W-What are you doing here?}}
{{TD|Yellow Diamond|I'm here to bring you back to reality, Blue.}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|I'm fine. Just leave me alone.}}
{{TD|Yellow Diamond|It's been thousands of years, Blue, and you still can't bring yourself to destroy these Gems? She was shattered by a [[Rose Quartz]]! The [[Quartzes#Rose_Quartzes|entire cut of Gem]] deserves the same fate!}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|But they were ''hers''.}}
{{TD|Yellow Diamond|They should be ''wiped'' out of existence, not kept safe in [[Gem Bubbles|bubbles]]!}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Greg run towards the door they entered from and try to open it, to no avail.'')}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|Yellow, she made them. This is all we have left of her. These Gems, this place, and the Earth.}}
{{TD||(''Steven and Greg then run back towards the pillar to hide behind it.'')}}
{{TD|Yellow Diamond|I thought we agreed we need to put that planet and this whole debacle behind us.}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|Why can't you just let me grieve?}}
{{TD|Yellow Diamond|You can't keep coming here forever!}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|Why not?}}
{{TD|Yellow Diamond|*sighs* Pearl, do something. Sing for her. Make her feel better.}}
{{TD|[[Yellow Pearl]]|Yes, my Diamond. Ahem. *turns to Blue Pearl* Ahem!}}

{{TD|Yellow Diamond|Get to the point, Agate.}}
{{TD|Holly Blue|*clears her throat* Yes, of course. My deepest apologies. You'll be pleased to know that your Sapphire has completed your special delivery.}}

{{TD|Holly Blue|Um, the special delivery you requested from Earth, of course.}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|*gets suspicious* I never asked any Sapphire to go to Earth.}}

{{TD||(''The floor beneath Sapphire begins to freeze up.'')}}
{{TD|Steven|Oh, no! She's freezing up!}}
{{TD||(''Ruby grabs hold of Sapphire's hand behind her, providing her some comfort and confidence.'')}}
{{TD|Sapphire|My... future vision foresaw you, my Diamond, desiring more... humans for the zoo, so I... acted accordingly.}}
{{TD|Blue Diamond|... It's true. The window for preserving Earth specimens is closing.}}
{{TD|Steven|Phew...}}
{{TD|Yellow Diamond|Is that what you want? Sapphire, has [[the Cluster]] emerged yet?}}
{{TD|Sapphire|No, it has not.}}
{{TD|Yellow Diamond|Then there's still time. That will be all. *claps twice*}}

{{TD|Sapphire|Of course! No surprises here.}}
{{TD||(''Holly Blue begins leading Sapphire and her group through the hallways, while Steven and Greg sneak cautiously behind.'')}}
{{TD|Holly Blue|I ''never'' expected to see Yellow Diamond in person. What a commanding presence. You can just feel strength and confidence radiating ''from'' her.}}

{{TD|Holly Blue|Don't misunderstand me, of course. I'll always be in Blue's confidence, but if I ''had'' been made for Yellow, you wouldn't see me complaining.}}
{{TD||(''Holly Blue leads the group back to the ship hangar. The Amethyst guards then notices Steven and Greg sneaking with the group, and try to act ignorant.'')}}
{{TD|Holly Blue|I do hope they appreciate all my hard work to preserve the [[Pink Diamond]] legacy. It would really make it worth being stationed here with these sorry excuses for Gems. Oh! It's a shame though.}}
{{TD||(''Holly Blue begins to monologue to herself with her eyes, and the group attempts to sneak past her to their [[Roaming Eye]].'')}}
{{TD|Holly Blue|This outpost is so remote, I was beginning to think we'd been forgotten. But we haven't! Two Diamonds, one day! What an honor. I don't think anything could spoil this for me.}}

{{TD|Holly Blue|What... is... '''''THE MEANING OF THIS?!'''''}}
{{TD||(''All the Quartz guards appear in the doorway, startled at Holly Blue's discovery.'')}}
{{TD|Holly Blue|Why are these two outside the containment area?!}}
{{TD|Sapphire|Holly Blue, I can explain.}}
{{TD|Holly Blue|No need, your clarity. Not even you could have foreseen how ''incompetent'' these Amethysts are. *summons a blue, electric whip* Well, if you want something done right, you just do it ''yourself''. You two are coming with me!}}

{{TD|Garnet|''We'll'' handle this noise.}}

{{TD|Holly Blue|I'll report you to the Diamonds! All of you! You'll all be ''shattered''!}}
{{TD|Pearl|*kneels down to Holly Blue* You're ''really'' gonna tell the Diamonds that you allowed a band of traitorous rebels to infiltrate a highly-secure facility and escape from right under your careful watch? *inhales sharply* Doesn't sound like a wise thing to do, Holly Blue~ So do yourself a favor and keep your mouth ''shut''. That will be all. *bows, and Steven claps twice*}}
{{TD||(''Holly Blue groans in misery while the Quartz guards continue to laugh at her and waving goodbye to the [[Crystal Gems]], as they begin to take off and leave the human zoo.'')}}
{{TD|Greg|Thanks so much for coming to get me. That has to be, like, the ''third'' craziest weekend I've ever had.}}
{{TD|Steven|Dad, I'm really sorry I got you into all this. This whole thing started 'cause... I wanted answers.}}
{{TD|Greg|You don't have to be sorry about a thing. I hope you found what you were looking for.}}
{{TD|Steven|I did. I found you.}}
