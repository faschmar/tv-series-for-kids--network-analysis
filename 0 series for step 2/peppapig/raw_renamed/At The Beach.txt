Mummy Pig: Good. Now before you start playing, you need some sun cream on.

[[Daddy Pig]]: Let’s try out this spotty ball.

Narrator: What a great spotty ball.

Peppa Pig: George, you throw the ball and I will catch it.

Peppa Pig: George, catch.

Narrator: Oh, dear. George is too little to catch the ball.

(George Pig cries and cries a bit.)

Daddy Pig: Never mind, George. Would you and Peppa like to have a paddle in the sea?

Peppa Pig: Yes, please, Daddy.

Daddy Pig: Let’s put your water wings on.

Daddy Pig: There we go. You look very smart in your water wings, George.

Peppa Pig: My turn, my turn.

Daddy Pig: Good. Now we can play in the water.

Peppa Pig: Hurrah!

Mummy Pig: Is the water cold?

Daddy Pig: It’s lovely and warm.

Daddy Pig: Steady on.

George: Hey presto!

Narrator: Another sand castle.

Mummy Pig: Peppa, George, home time! Don’t leave any stuff behind.

Peppa Pig: Daddy! We forgot Daddy!

Mummy Pig: Yes, we forgot Daddy Pig.

Daddy Pig: What?

Peppa Pig: Daddy, we almost left you behind. But George remembered you.
