Mummy Pig: Oh, dear. Daddy Pig cannot see a thing without them. And it makes him very grumpy.

Narrator: Without his glasses on, Daddy Pig cannot read his newspaper.

Daddy Pig: This is ridiculous. I can’t see anything. Somebody must have put my glasses somewhere.

Mummy Pig: Do you remember where you last put them, Daddy Pig?

Daddy Pig: When I don’t wear them I always put them in my pocket. But they aren’t there now.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, can we help find your glasses?

Peppa Pig: We’ve looked everywhere but we can’t find Daddy’s glasses.

Mummy Pig: Oh, dear. Now what can we do?

Peppa Pig: There they are. Daddy’s glasses.

Mummy Pig: Daddy Pig. You were sitting on them all the time.

Daddy Pig: Oh.

Peppa Pig: Silly Daddy.

Daddy Pig: I don’t know how they got there.
