Peppa Pig: Oh.

Daddy Pig: Oh.

Peppa Pig: Mummy, Daddy, It’s gone all dark, and the music is broken.

Daddy Pig: And my vacuum won’t work.

Muumy Pig: And my computer has switched off.

Peppa and George: Ooh.

Narrator: Mummy Pig tries the light switch, but the lights do not come on.

Mummy Pig: It must be a power cut.

Peppa Pig:[snorts] What’s a power cut.

Mummy Pig: A power cut is when there is no electricity.

Peppa Pig: What’s “electrickety”?

Daddy Pig: Electricity is what makes everything in our house work.

Peppa Pig: Will the “electrickety” come back again?

Daddy Pig: Yes, but in the meantime, we need to find a torch.

Mummy Pig: I think there’s a torch in the cellar.

Daddy Pig: Okay, I’ll go and get it.

Mummy Pig: Will you be okay, Daddy?

Daddy Pig: Oh-ho, I’ll be fine. I can see very well in the dark.

sounds: [banging and clanking]

Daddy Pig: Who put that there?

Mummy Pig: Ooh.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, are you okay?

Daddy Pig: Yes, it’s just a bit dark down here.

sounds: [ banging and clanking]

Mummy Pig: Oh, I’ve just remembered, I think the torch is in the kitchen.

Peppa and George: [giggling]

Mummy Pig: Aha.

Narrator: Mummy Pig has found the torch.

Peppa Pig: Can I hold the torch, Mummy?

Mummy Pig: Okay.

Peppa Pig: [giggling] George, look at me.

Narrator: Peppa is making a funny face.

George: [crying]

Mummy Pig: Don’t worry, George. It’s only Peppa.

George: [laughing]

Mummy Pig: Oh, we’d better tell Daddy we found the torch.

sounds: [clanking and clattering]

Narrator: Daddy is still in the cellar looking for the torch.

Daddy Pig: I’m sure it’s here somewhere.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, we found the torch. Luckily, it was in the kitchen all the time.

Daddy Pig: What a stroke of luck. [laughing]

Mummy Pig: [snorts] Now we just have to wait until the electricity comes back.

Peppa Pig: How long will that be, exactly?

Daddy Pig: Uh, I would say exactly…a long time.

Peppa and George: Oh.

Peppa Pig: But George and I want to do some dancing. [snorts] I know what we can do. We can watch some television. Oh, it won’t go on.

Daddy Pig and Mummy Pig: [laughter]

Daddy Pig: [snorts] The TV needs electricity too.

Peppa Pig: Does it?

Daddy Pig and Mummy Pig: Yes.

Peppa Pig: Oh. Now what are we going to do?

Mummy Pig: In the olden days, when there was no television, children would have to make their own games.

Peppa Pig: Hmm… I know! [snorts] I need a cardboard box.

Narrator: What is Peppa doing?

Peppa Pig: [snorts] Mummy, will you cut a hole in this box for me?

Daddy Pig: What for?

Peppa Pig: You’ll see.

Narrator: Mummy Pig is cutting a hole in the cardboard box.

Mummy Pig: There you are, Peppa.

Peppa Pig: Thank you. Now, you all have to sit down there. And George, you have to point this torch at me.

George: [snorts twice]

Peppa Pig: [giggling] Ahem. Welcome to Peppa Pig news with me, Peppa Pig.

All excepts Peppa: [laughter]

Narrator: Peppa has made her own television.

Peppa Pig: [snorts] Today the whole world stopped working when there was a power cut, and all the “electrickety” was lost.

All except Peppa: [laughter]

Mummy Pig: Very good, Peppa.

Peppa Pig: Daddy Pig says that the “electrickety” won’t be back for a long, long time.

All: Oh!

Narrator: The electricity is back.

Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig: Hooray!

Peppa Pig: Shush! I haven’t finished yet. [snorts] Switch the lights off.

Daddy Pig: Okay, Peppa.

Peppa Pig: Good. Ahem, I have some very important news. The Queen has just found some more “electrickety” and says that everyone can now be happy again.

Daddy Pig: Very good, Peppa.

All: Hooray!

Peppa Pig: [giggling] Let’s dance!

sounds: [upbeat music]

All: [laughter]

Narrator: Peppa quite enjoyed the power cut, but she’s happy the electricity is back again.
