Freddy: I don't know, but I can't wait to get there!

(The bus goes through a gate. There is a sign on top of it of a dinosaur walking through a jungle.)

Miss Rabbit: We're here!

Grampy Rabbit: Welcome to Grampy Rabbit's... DINOSAUR PARK!

All (except for Grampy Rabbit): Oooooh!

George: Dine-saw! Grrrr! (giggles)

Narrator: George loves dinosaurs.

Peppa: Are there ''really'' dinosaurs here?

Grampy Rabbit: No. Just pretend ones.

Peppa: Phew!

Narrator: Edmond knows all about dinosaurs. He is a clever clogs.

Grampy Rabbit: But we've got better than ''real ''dinosaurs. We've got... singing dinosaurs!

(Three animatronic dinosaurs rise out of a bush. One is a purple Brontosaurus. One is a blue Tyrannosaurus Rex. One is an orange Triceratops. They start singing in chipmunk voices.)

Three Animatronic Dinosaurs: ♪We are the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs. We are the dinosaurs, listen to us roar.♪ ''ROAAAAR!''

(The three animatronic dinosaurs go back down into the bush. Everyone (except Grampy Rabbit) laughs.)

Suzy: They're a bit small.

Daddy Pig: Yes. Are dinosaurs meant to be big?

Grampy Rabbit: Ah, yes. We ''do ''have a big dinosaur. A real whopper! Would you like to meet it?

Kids: Yes, please!

(Grampy Rabbit points to some dinosaur footprints.)

Grampy Rabbit: These are its footprints. We just have to follow them. (follows the footprints)

All (except for Grampy Rabbit): Ooooooh!

(Everyone follows the dinosaur footprints.)

Daddy Pig: These footprints look very real. Are you sure there's no living dinosaurs about, Grampy Rabbit?

Grampy Rabbit: I'm quite sure, Daddy Pig.

(Everyone comes to the footprints on some boulders. They hop on them.)

Grampy Rabbit: Over the boulders, everyone!

(The kids giggle as they hop on the boulders. Cuts to everyone walking over a bridge where more footprints are.)

Grampy Rabbit: Across the bridge.

Kids: (giggle)

(Everyone goes into a yellow tunnel.)

Grampy Rabbit: Through the cave!

(The kids run into the tunnel giggling.)

Rebecca: Oh. The footprints have stopped.

Freddy: (points to green stairs) Look! There are some green steps!

(Freddy runs on the green stairs. Everyone else follows him at the top.)

Freddy: It's a big slide! (slides down) Whee!

(Emily Elephant, Suzy Sheep, Candy Cat, Wendy Wolf, Rebecca Rabbit, Edmond Elephant, Rebecca Rabbit, Pedro Pony, Danny Dog, George Pig, and Zoe Zebra get to the top of the slide. They all slide down.)

All Kids (except for Peppa Pig and Freddy Fox): Whee!

All Adults (except for Grampy Rabbit): Whoa!

(Peppa gets to the top of the slide and slides down.)

(The green slide is a Brontosaurus. Grampy Rabbit gets on top of the slide.)

Peppa Pig: Wow! It's a big dinosaur!

Grampy Rabbit: Yes! It's my whopping, ginormous... DINOSAUR SLIDE!!!! (slides down the slide) AAAAAA-'''''AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'''''-AAAA-AAAAAA-AAAAAAAAAHHH!

(Grampy Rabbit lands down onto the ground.)

Daddy Pig: That's some dinosaur!

Grampy Rabbit: That is a Brontosaurus.

Edmond: Actually, the correct name is "Apatosaurus."

Grampy Rabbit: You're a bit of a clever clogs, aren't you?

Edmond: Yes.

Grampy Rabbit: Right, my little explorers. Are you ready for the next bit of the adventure?

Everyone (except for Grampy Rabbit) Yes, Grampy Rabbit!

Grampy Rabbit: We have to find an egg.

Suzy: An egg?

Peppa: But eggs are little. It could be anywhere.

Freddy: Leave it to me! Foxes love hunting for eggs.

(Freddy starts walking and sniffing the ground at the same time)

Narrator: Freddy Fox has a very good sense of smell.

Freddy: Wow! What an egg!

Peppa: It's huge!

Suzy: Why is the egg so big?

Grampy Rabbit: It's a dinosaur egg.

Peppa: Is it real?

Grampy Rabbit: No. It's better than real; it's pretend! Watch this.

(Fake giant purple egg opens and it has a chocolate birthday cake in it)

Purple Egg: Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday!

Narrator: The dinosaur egg has a birthday cake inside it.

Everyone (except for Grampy Rabbit): Hooray!

Daddy Pig: It's not a pretend cake, is it, Grampy Rabbit?

Grampy Rabbit: No, the cake is real and very tasty! Who wants some?

Everyone (except Grampy Rabbit): Me! Me!

Grampy Rabbit: Birthday boy first! Here you go, Freddy!

(Freddy blows out the candles on the cake)

Everyone (except Freddy): Happy birthday, Freddy!

Grampy Rabbit: Time for a bit of song and dance. Everyone copy me! Do the stomp, do the dinosaur stomp! Do the rawr, do the dinosaur rawr! Stomp, stomp, stomp! Rawr, rawr, rawr! Do the dinosaur stomp!

(Everyone except for the grown-ups laugh)
