Narrator: Peppa and George are helping Grandpa Pig in his garden.

Peppa Pig: Wow!

Narrator: What a beautiful butterfly.

Peppa Pig: Grandpa, why do butterflies like flowers?

Grandpa Pig: They get their food from flowers.

Peppa Pig: How?

Grandpa Pig: They have very long tongues.

Peppa Pig: Longer than mine?

Grandpa Pig: Oh, yes, the butterfly's tongue is even longer than yours. She uses it to drink from the flower.

Peppa Pig: Wow!

Grandpa Pig: Peppa, the butterfly thinks you're a flower.

Peppa Pig: I'm not a flower! I'm Peppa Pig! She is so pretty. I want to be a butterfly.

Narrator: Peppa is playing at being a butterfly.

Peppa Pig: I'm a little butterfly!

Narrator: George wants to play, too.

Peppa Pig: George, I'm the butterfly. You have to be something else.

Peppa Pig: I know. You can be a wriggly worm.

Peppa Pig: Look, look! I'm a butterfly.

(George drops the wiggly worm and starts crying)

Narrator: Oh dear! George does not want to be a worm. He wants to be a butterfly.

Grandpa Pig: George, when I was a little piggy, I used to like playing at being a worm. It's very easy to be a worm. I'll show you how.

Grandpa Pig: First, you have to lie down on the ground. Then, you wriggle around. I'm a wriggly worm!

Narrator: George and Grandpa Pig are having such fun being wriggly worms.

Peppa Pig: I'm a little butterfly. I'm a little butterfly!

Peppa Pig: Look, look. I'm a butterfly.

Grandpa Pig: Yes, Peppa, you're a beautiful butterfly.

Peppa Pig: Grandpa, George, what are you doing?

Grandpa Pig: We are wriggly worms.

Peppa Pig: I want to be a wriggly worm, too. I'm a wriggly worm.

Grandpa Pig: I'm a wriggly worm.

Peppa Pig: I'm a wriggly worm. I'm a wriggly worm. How do you do? I love you. I'm a wriggly worm.

Grandpa Pig: That was fun. What animal do you want to be now?

Peppa Pig: Hmm. I don't know.

Peppa Pig: Look, Grandpa! There's a little frog.

Grandpa Pig: Why don't you play at being frogs?

Peppa Pig: Hmm, frogs are not as pretty as butterflies or as wriggly as worms.

Grandpa Pig: But frogs do play a game you like.

Peppa Pig: Hmm. Do frogs play dolls' houses?

Grandpa Pig: Silly Peppa. What's your favorite game?

Peppa Pig: Jumping in muddy puddles!

Grandpa Pig: Yes. Frogs love jumping in muddy puddles.

Peppa Pig: Yes, George! Let's play frogs.

Peppa Pig: I'm a little froggy. I'm a little froggy.

Narrator: The froggies have found a nice big muddy puddle to play in. Peppa and George love jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Peppa Pig: Butterflies and worms are very nice. But I like frogs the best.
