* Daddy Pig: Then let’s go.
* Narrator: This is the park.
* Daddy Pig: We’re here.
* Mummy Pig, Peppa Pig and George: Hurrah!
* Peppa Pig: Mummy, why are all the leaves red and yellow?
* Mummy Pig: It’s autumn time, Peppa.
* Narrator: In the autumn, it gets a bit colder and the leaves change colour.
* Daddy Pig: It’s quite windy. Let’s play a game to keep warm.
* Peppa Pig: My turn.
* Peppa Pig: Oh, it’s not meant to go that way.
* Narrator: The wind is blowing the ball along.
* Peppa Pig: The ball is in the pond.
* Daddy Pig: Hmm. I’ll just use this stick to reach it.
* Peppa Pig: Just a bit further, Daddy.
* Mummy Pig: Be careful, Daddy Pig.
* Daddy Pig: Don’t worry. I’ve almost got it.
* Daddy Pig: Whoa!
* Peppa Pig: Daddy, is the water cold?
* Daddy Pig: A little bit.
* Narrator: The wind has blown the ball out of the pond.
* Peppa Pig: That’s lucky.
* Daddy Pig: Yes. What a stroke of luck.
* Mummy Pig: It’s getting even windier. Hold on to your hats.
* Narrator: No. The wind has blown George’s hat off.
* (George Pig was crying because he loses his hat)
* Mummy Pig: Don’t worry, George. Daddy Pig will catch your hat.
* Peppa Pig: Quick, Daddy!
* Peppa Pig: Look. It’s in that little tree.
* Daddy Pig: Hmm. I’ll just climb up and get it.
* Mummy Pig: The tree’s much too thin to take your weight, Daddy Pig.
* Daddy Pig: So, how can we get George’s hat?
* Mummy Pig: Simple. I’ll give the tree a little shake.
* Mummy Pig: Hmm. Maybe if I shake it a bit harder.
* Daddy Pig: I thought that sort of thing only happened to me.
* Mummy Pig: It’s not funny.
* Peppa Pig: It is a bit funny, Mummy.
* Mummy Pig: I suppose it is a bit funny.
* Mummy Pig: Where’s George’s hat?
* Peppa Pig: It’s on your head.
* Mummy Pig: Here’s your hat, George. Hold on to it this time.
* Narrator: The wind is blowing all the leaves off the trees.
* Peppa Pig: Look at me! I’m leaning into the wind.
* Narrator: The wind is strong enough to hold Peppa up.
* Narrator: The wind is strong enough to hold George up.
* Peppa Pig: Daddy, have a go.
* Daddy Pig: Uh, I’m a bit too heavy.
* Peppa Pig: Come on, Daddy. It’s really fun.
* Daddy Pig: Oh, all right.
* Narrator: The wind is strong enough to hold up Daddy Pig.
* Daddy Pig: I say, this is fun.
* Daddy Pig: Come on, Mummy Pig. Give it a try.
* Mummy Pig: But if the wind stops, I’ll fall over.
* Daddy Pig: The wind won’t just stop.
* Narrator: The wind has stopped.
* Daddy Pig: It’s not funny.
* Mummy Pig: It is a bit funny.
* Peppa Pig: Now the wind has stopped, what can we do?
* Daddy Pig: Hmm, what’s your favourite game?
* Peppa Pig: Jumping up and down in muddy puddles!
* Peppa Pig: But there aren’t any puddles. Just lots of boring, dry leaves.
* Daddy Pig: And what do you do with dry leaves?
* Peppa Pig: I don’t know.
* Daddy Pig: Jump up and down in them!
* Narrator: Daddy Pig loves jumping up and down in leaves.
* Narrator: Peppa loves jumping up and down in leaves.
* Narrator: Everyone loves jumping up and down in leaves.
* Peppa Pig: This is the best autumn day ever.
