{{Super Episode Template}}Narrator: [[George Pig]] is playing with his ball in the garden.

Narrator: [[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa]] wants to play, too.

Peppa Pig: George, you’re doing it all wrong.

Peppa Pig: This is how to catch a ball.

Peppa Pig: Not like this.

Peppa Pig: That’s what you do.

Narrator: What a cheeky little one Peppa is.

Peppa Pig: George, come back, you little piggy.

Narrator: Maybe Peppa is teasing George just a bit too much.

[[Mummy Pig]]: Peppa, have you been teasing George?

Peppa Pig: Not really, Mummy. I was teaching him how to catch.

Mummy Pig: Really? Well I know a game that will teach George how to catch. It’s called Piggy in the Middle.

Mummy Pig: Peppa, you take the ball and stand over there. And George, you stand over there.

Mummy Pig: Good. You have to throw the ball to each other, and I have to try and catch it. I’m the piggy in the middle.

Peppa Pig: Mummy is the piggy in the middle.

Peppa Pig: Catch, George.

Mummy Pig: Oh, missed it.

Narrator: George has caught the ball.

Mummy Pig and Peppa Pig: Hurrah!

Mummy Pig: Well done, George. Now you throw the ball to Peppa.

Mummy Pig: Oop, try again.

Mummy Pig: Oh, try again.

Narrator: George cannot throw the ball past Mummy Pig.

Peppa Pig: Come on, George. Give the ball to me.

Peppa Pig: Silly George. I can do that too.

Narrator: Peppa wanted to copy George, but she’s too big and has got stuck.

Mummy Pig: I’ve got the ball. Peppa, now it’s your turn to be piggy.

Mummy Pig: George, catch.

Mummy Pig and Peppa Pig: Hurrah!

Peppa Pig: Caught it. George, you’re the piggy.

Peppa Pig: George, catch.

Mummy Pig: Catch the ball, George.

Peppa Pig: Catch, George.

Mummy Pig: George, catch.

Peppa Pig: Here’s the ball, George.

Peppa Pig: Whee!

(George Pig is crying)

Mummy Pig: Oh, dear. Peppa, you shouldn’t tease George like that.

Peppa Pig: Sorry, George.

(Geroge cries a bit)

[[Daddy Pig]]: What’s all the noise?

Peppa Pig: Daddy, George is too little to play Piggy in the Middle.

Daddy Pig: Oh, I’m sure he’s big enough.

Peppa Pig: No, he isn’t, Daddy. Watch.

Daddy Pig: Catch it, George.

Daddy Pig and Mummy Pig: Hurrah!

Peppa Pig: That’s not fair.

Daddy Pig: Yes it is. I just gave George a helping hand.

Peppa Pig: Mummy, can I have a helping hand?

Mummy Pig: Of course you can, Peppa.

Peppa Pig: To me, George!

Peppa Pig: Catch, George.
