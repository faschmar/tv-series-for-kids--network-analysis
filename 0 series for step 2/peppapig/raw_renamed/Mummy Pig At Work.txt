(Peppa and George laugh)

Peppa Pig: Mummy, can we play that computer game, Happy Mrs Chicken?

Mummy Pig: We can play Happy Mrs Chicken later, but now I have to work.

Peppa Pig: Mummy, can we help you work? (presses the keys)

Mummy Pig: No, Peppa! You mustn't touch the computer. And, George, you mustn't touch the computer either.

Peppa Pig: Yes, George, you mustn't do this. (presses the keys)

Mummy Pig: Peppa, stop!

Peppa Pig: Sorry, Mummy. I was just showing George what not to do.

(The computer rapidly flashes colors)

Narrator: Oh, dear. The computer is not meant to do that.

Mummy Pig: Daddy Pig! Daddy Pig!

Daddy Pig: What is it, Mummy Pig?

Mummy Pig: Daddy Pig, can you mend the computer?

Daddy Pig: Uhh...

Mummy Pig: I'll finish the lunch while you mend the computer.

Daddy Pig: Uh, right you are, Mummy Pig, but I'm not very good with these things.

Mummy Pig: Oh, thank you, Daddy Pig.

Narrator: Daddy Pig is going to mend the computer.

Daddy Pig: Hmmm... (touches a key on the computer. It makes a beep sound) Hmmm...Hmmm...Um, maybe if I just switch it off (turns off the computer) ...and then switch it on again. (turns on the computer)

Narrator: Daddy Pig has mended the computer.

Peppa Pig: Hurrah, Daddy!

Daddy Pig: Yes, I am a bit of an expert at these things.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, can we play that computer game, Happy Mrs Chicken?

Daddy Pig: Maybe you should ask Mummy Pig.

Peppa Pig: Mummy said that we could play it later.

Daddy Pig: Well, that's OK then. But I don't know where the disk is.

(George gets the Happy Mrs Chicken game. Daddy Pig inserts the disc in)

Peppa Pig: Yippee!

(Daddy Pig laughs)

Peppa Pig: Now it's my turn! (touches the computer two times. Happy Mrs Chicken lays another egg)

Daddy Pig: Now it's my turn.

Mummy Pig: What on earth is going on?

Mummy Pig: Well, I see the computer is working again.

(Boing sound, and the chicks cluck)

(Daddy Pig, Mummy Pig, Peppa and George laugh while the chicks lay eggs)
