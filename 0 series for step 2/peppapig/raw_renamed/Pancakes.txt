{{Super Episode Template}}Narrator: It is teatime and [[Mummy Pig]] has a surprise for everyone.

Mummy Pig: Today is a day for pancakes.

[[Daddy Pig]]: Pancakes. Delicious.

[[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa Pig]]: I love pancakes.

Narrator: Everyone loves pancakes.

Daddy Pig: I’m the expert at flipping the pancakes over. Leave that to me.

Mummy Pig: Are you sure, Daddy Pig? Last time you got a bit grumpy when you dropped the pancake on the floor.

Daddy Pig: I did not get grumpy. There was a problem with the frying pan.

Peppa Pig: Mummy, can we help make the pancakes, please?

Mummy Pig: Yes, you can help me make the batter.

Mummy Pig: First, I put some flour in the bowl.

Peppa Pig and [[George Pig|George]]: Oo-oo.

Mummy Pig: Now I add an egg.

Mummy Pig: Now the milk.

Mummy Pig: And I give it all a stir.

Peppa Pig: Mummy, can I stir?

Mummy Pig: Yes, of course, Peppa.

Narrator: Peppa loves stirring.

Narrator: George wants to stir as well.

Peppa Pig: No, George. Like this.

Mummy Pig: Okay, that’s enough stirring. You two sit at the table while I cook the pancakes.

Narrator: Mummy Pig is going to flip the pancake over.

Peppa Pig: Hurrah!

Daddy Pig: You could flip it higher, Mummy Pig.

Mummy Pig: You can show us how when you flip your own pancake, Daddy Pig.

Narrator: This first pancake is for George.

Narrator: Mummy Pig pours a little syrup on George’s pancake.

Narrator: Delicious.

Narrator: This pancake is for Peppa.

Peppa Pig: Hurrah!

Daddy Pig: Hmm. You could flip it higher, Mummy Pig.

Mummy Pig: You will get a chance to show me when you flip your own pancake, Daddy Pig.

Peppa Pig: Syrup please.

Peppa Pig: Mmm, delicious.

Narrator: This pancake is for Mummy Pig.

Peppa Pig: Hurrah!

Daddy Pig: You still aren’t flipping them high enough, Mummy Pig.

Mummy Pig: The next pancake is yours, Daddy Pig. So now you can show us how it should be done.

Mummy Pig: Mmm, delicious.

Daddy Pig: Is everyone watching?

Daddy Pig: The secret of making a good pancake is to flip it high into the air.

Daddy Pig: A-one, two, three, hoopla!

Peppa Pig: Silly Daddy.

Daddy Pig: Oh, maybe that was just a bit too high.

Mummy Pig: What a shame. That was the last pancake.

Daddy Pig: It should be a simple matter to get it down.

Narrator: Oh dear. Daddy Pig cannot reach his pancake.

Mummy Pig: Don’t worry, Daddy Pig. I think I know a way to get it down.

Mummy Pig: Let’s go upstairs, children.

Mummy Pig: This way.

Narrator: What is Mummy Pig planning to do?

Mummy Pig: On the count of three we all have to start jumping up and down. One, two, three, jump!

Daddy Pig: What are they doing?

Narrator: It worked! Now Daddy Pig has his pancake.

Peppa Pig: Daddy has a pancake on his head.

Mummy Pig: Syrup on your pancake, Daddy Pig?

Daddy Pig: Yes, please.

Daddy Pig: One, two, three, hoopla!

Daddy Pig: Delicious.

Peppa Pig: Silly daddy.
