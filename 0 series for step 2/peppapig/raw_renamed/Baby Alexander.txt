Narrator: Peppa and George's cousins are coming to visit today.

Peppa: Mummy, how long before Cousin Chloe is here?

Mummy: Not long now, Peppa. Baby Alexander is coming too, remember?

Peppa: Oh. Babies cry all the time! They're so noisy!

Daddy: I'm sure Baby Alexander won't be that noisy. (Hears Baby Alexander crying)

Mummy: What's that sound?

Daddy: Is it a car alarm?

Peppa: Is it a fire engine?

Mummy: (Sees Uncle Pig, Auntie Pig, Cousin Chloe and Baby Alexander arrive) No! It's Baby Alexander!

Cousin Chloe: Hello, Peppa! Hello, George!

Peppa: Hello, Cousin Chloe!

Uncle Pig: Hello, Everyone!

Mummy: Hello, Uncle Pig!

Auntie Pig: Hello!

Daddy: Hello, Auntie Pig!

Auntie Pig: You remember, Baby Alexander, don't you, Peppa?

Peppa: Yes!

Baby Alexander laughs as Auntie Pig gets out a toy to make him stop crying.

Daddy: Are you staying for a few days?

Auntie Pig: No! This is what Alexander needs for just one day.

Uncle Pig: Can't go anywhere without all these baby things.

Daddy: Oh.

Peppa: Hello, Baby Alexander!

Cousin Chloe: He can't talk, Peppa!

Peppa: If he can't talk, then, how do you know what he wants?

Uncle Pig: We Guess! (Hears Baby Alexander crying) I'm guessing he's hungry!

Auntie Pig: Peppa! Would you like to help feed Alexander?



Peppa: Yes please! 

More Text coming soon! (TBA)
