Dr. Brown Bear: Hello, Peppa. How are you today?

Peppa Pig: I’m not very well.

Dr. Brown Bear: Stick your tongue out, please.

Dr. Brown Bear: Hmm. It’s not anything serious. Peppa has just got a rash.

Peppa Pig: Do I need medicine?

Dr. Brown Bear: The rash will clear up quickly, but if you like I can give you just a little medicine.

Peppa Pig: Yes, please.

Dr. Brown Bear: I’m afraid it doesn’t taste very nice. Open wide, please.

Peppa Pig: Yuck! Disgusting!

Dr. Brown Bear: You are a brave little one for taking it so well.

Dr. Brown Bear: Peppa must stay in bed. I’ll call back later to check that she’s better.

Mummy Pig: Can Peppa have visitors?

Dr. Brown Bear: Oh, yes, she can have visitors. The rash isn’t catching. Goodbye.

Daddy Pig: Goodbye, Dr. Brown Bear.

Peppa Pig: Mummy, can I get up now?

Mummy Pig: Dr. Brown Bear says that you must stay in bed for a little bit, Peppa.

Peppa Pig: Oh. But it’s so boring.

Mummy Pig: Dr. Brown Bear did say you could have visitors.

Peppa Pig: Could Suzy Sheep visit me?

Narrator: Suzy Sheep is Peppa’s best friend.

Mummy Pig: I’ll ring Suzy Sheep’s mummy.

Mrs Sheep: Hello, Mrs Pig.

Mummy Pig: May Peppa talk with Suzy, please?

Peppa Pig: Hello, Suzy.

Suzy Sheep: Hello, Peppa.

Peppa Pig: I’m not very well. I have red spots on my face.

Suzy Sheep: Has the doctor been?

Peppa Pig: Yes, Dr. Brown Bear was here. He said I wasn’t very well and that I was very brave.

Suzy Sheep: So are you really ill?

Peppa Pig: Yes, yes. It’s not pretend. I have to stay in bed. Dr. Brown Bear gave me medicine that tasted really horrible.

Suzy Sheep: I’m coming to see you. I’m going to wear my nurse’s outfit.

Narrator: Suzy Sheep has come to see Peppa. Suzy is wearing her nurse’s costume. Danny Dog and Rebecca Rabbit have come along too.

Suzy Sheep, Danny Dog, Rebecca Rabbit: Hello, Peppa.

Peppa Pig: Hello.

Suzy Sheep: How do you feel?

Peppa Pig: I’m not very well, Suzy. I have to stay in bed.

Suzy Sheep: What can we do to make you better?

Peppa Pig: You can get me some orange juice.

Suzy Sheep: Okay.

Narrator: Peppa seems to be quite enjoying herself.

Peppa Pig: Thank you, Suzy.

Suzy Sheep: Do you feel any better?

Peppa Pig: A little bit.

Peppa Pig: Danny, ask my mummy if I could have some ice cream. And Rebecca, could you bring me some flowers from the garden?

Narrator: Dr. Brown Bear is here to see whether Peppa is better.

Dr. Brown Bear: Ah, good. The nurse is already here. How is the patient?

Suzy Sheep: I’m not a real nurse. It’s just pretend.

Dr. Brown Bear: I see. Would you like me to take a look myself?

Suzy Sheep: Yes, please.

Dr. Brown Bear: I say! No more red spots! You’re completely better.

Peppa Pig: Aren’t I still a bit ill?

Dr. Brown Bear: How do you feel?

Peppa Pig: I think I should stay in bed a little bit more.

Daddy Pig: I fancy a game with this ball in the garden. Who wants to join me?

Suzy Sheep, Danny Dog, Rebecca Rabbit: Me, me, me!

Peppa Pig: Me too!

Dr. Brown Bear: Well, I never. A complete recovery.
