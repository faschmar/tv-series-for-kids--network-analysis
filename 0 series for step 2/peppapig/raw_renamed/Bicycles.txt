{{Super Episode Template}}Narrator: It is a lovely sunny day and [[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa]] and [[George Pig|George]] are riding their bicycles.

[[Mummy Pig]]: That’s a fine pumpkin, [[Daddy Pig]].

Narrator: Daddy Pig is very proud of his pumpkin.

Daddy Pig: Pumpkins are the only thing I can grow. Probably because I love pumpkin pie.

Peppa Pig: Come on, George. [[Danny Dog|Danny]]! [[Suzy Sheep|Suzy]]! [[Rebecca Rabbit (character)|Rebecca]]!

Narrator: Peppa and her friends, Danny Dog, Suzy Sheep and Rebecca Rabbit, are riding their bicycles. George is riding his tricycle.

Peppa Pig: He’s going so slowly.

Danny Dog: Let’s race to Daddy Pig’s pumpkin.

Peppa Pig: If we race to Daddy’s pumpkin, we have to be very 
careful not to bump into it. Daddy would be very sad if the pumpkin got broken.

Danny Dog: Don’t worry, Peppa. Race you.

Narrator: Peppa and her friends are racing to Daddy Pig’s pumpkin.

Daddy Pig: Hey, watch out for my pumpkin.

Danny Dog: Hurrah!

Mummy Pig: Peppa, look out. Daddy’s pumpkin.

Peppa Pig: Sorry, Daddy.

Peppa Pig: Look at George. He’s going so slowly. George is still riding a baby bike.

Danny Dog: Yours is a baby bike too, Peppa. You’ve still got stabilisers.

Rebecca Rabbit: I can ride without my stabilisers.

Suzy Sheep: Me too.

Danny Dog: And me.

Danny Dog: Let’s ride up the hill again. Are you coming, Peppa?

Peppa Pig: No, I think I’ll stay here.

Suzy Sheep: See you later.

Peppa Pig: Bye.

Narrator: Peppa wishes she did not have stabilisers on her bicycle.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, I don’t want stabiliers anymore.

Daddy Pig: Do you think you can ride without them?

Peppa Pig: Yes.

Daddy Pig: All right, Peppa. Let’s take them off.

Narrator: Daddy Pig is taking the stabilisers off Peppa’s bicycle.

Mummy Pig: Are you sure you want to ride without stabilisers?

Peppa Pig: Yes.

Mummy Pig: You’ve never done it before.

Peppa Pig: I can do it. I can, I can.

Peppa Pig: It’s not funny.

Narrator: Riding without stabilisers is not easy.

Daddy Pig: Would you like some help, Peppa?

Peppa Pig: Yes, please, Daddy.

Daddy Pig: All right. Ready, steady, go.

Peppa Pig: Don’t let go, Daddy.

Daddy Pig: Don’t worry. I’ve got you.

Mummy Pig: You’re doing really well, Peppa.

Peppa Pig: Hold on, Daddy.

Daddy Pig: Just keep pedalling.

Narrator: Peppa is riding on her own without stabilisers.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, you let go.

Daddy Pig: You’ve been cycling on your own for ages.

Peppa Pig: Have I?

Mummy Pig: You’re really very good at it.

Peppa Pig: Am I?

Peppa Pig: Oh, I can do it. Look at me, look at me. I can ride my bike properly.

Peppa Pig: Danny, Suzy, Rebecca, look. I don’t need my stabilisers anymore. Look at me.

Danny Dog, Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit: Hurrah!

Peppa Pig: Race you to Daddy’s pumpkin.

Peppa Pig: Whee!

Daddy Pig: Peppa, look out! My pumpkin!

Peppa Pig: I’m going to win.

Narrator: Peppa is not looking where she is going.

Narrator: Oh, dear. Peppa has squashed Daddy Pig’s pumpkin.

Peppa Pig: Sorry I squashed your pumpkin, Daddy.

Daddy Pig: Never mind the pumpkin. The important thing is that you are okay. In future you really must look where you’re going.

Peppa Pig: I promise I will, Daddy

Daddy Pig: Good. Anyway, now the pumpkin is broken, I can make it into pumpkin pie.

Peppa Pig: I love pumpkin pie.

Mummy Pig: And because Daddy Pig’s pumpkin is so big, there will be enough pumpkin pie for everyone.
