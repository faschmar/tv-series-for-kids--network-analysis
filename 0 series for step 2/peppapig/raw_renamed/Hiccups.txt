Narrator: [[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa]], [[George Pig|George]], [[Mummy Pig|Mummy]] and [[Daddy Pig|Daddy]] are having breakfast. It is a lovely sunny day, and Peppa and George can’t wait to go into the garden to play.

Peppa Pig: Mummy, please can we go out to play?

Mummy Pig: You can go out to play when you finish your breakfast.

(Peppa eats her cereal)

Daddy Pig: George, don’t drink your juice too quickly.

(George drinks his juice, but now he has hiccups.)

Narrator: George drank his juice too quickly, and now he has hiccups.

Peppa Pig: Can we go out to play now, Mummy?

Mummy Pig: Not while George has hiccups.

Peppa Pig: But George’s hiccups have gone, Mummy. Haven’t they, George?

(George still hiccuping, and The Pig familly starts laughing, except George.)

Mummy Pig: Oh, all right. You can go out and play. But look after George.

Narrator: Peppa and George love playing in the garden.

Peppa Pig: George, I’m going to throw the ball and then you have to catch it.

(George starts hiccuping, spoling)

Peppa Pig: George, please stop hiccuping.

(George still hiccuping, when Peppa throws the ball and gets hit)

Peppa Pig: George!

Peppa Pig: Now you throw the ball to me and I have to catch it.

(George throws the ball, but he hiccups)

Peppa Pig: GEORGE!

Narrator: Oh, dear. George’s hiccups are spoiling the game.

Peppa Pig: George, I know how to cure hiccups. You have to do what I say.

Peppa Pig: Rub the top of your head and rub your tummy.

Peppa Pig: Good. Now your hiccups have gone.

(But... George still had hiccups.)

Narrator: Peppa’s cure for hiccups doesn’t seem to have worked.

Peppa Pig: George, you’ve done it all wrong. I know a better way 
to cure hiccups. First, jump up and down three times on one leg.

Peppa Pig: Now wave your arms up and down and stick your tongue out.

Peppa Pig: And now close your eyes and turn around quickly three times.

(George still hiccups)

Narrator: Peppa’s new cure hasn’t worked either. George still has hiccups.

Peppa Pig: I know! To cure hiccups, the little piggy must be given a 
shock. George, I’m going to scare you, but you must remember it’s only a
<nowiki> </nowiki>game and it will stop your hiccups.

(Peppa Pig covers her eyes)

Peppa Pig: Remember, ''THIS IS JUST PRETEND SCARING.''

(Peppa Pig covers her eyes and having a loud snort to scare George, George looks at the screen, blinks twice and cries)

Mummy Pig: Peppa! you mustn’t play so roughly with George! He’s only little and Small.

Peppa Pig: Sorry, Mummy. I was just trying to stop George’s hiccups.

Narrator: George’s hiccups have gone. 

Narrator: Here comes Daddy Pig with two beakers of juice.

(George jumps up and down. Them he grabs the juice, that he's about to drink)

Mummy Pig: George, if you drink too quickly you will get hiccups again.

Peppa Pig: I’m not as little as George. I can drink juice as quickly as I want to.

(Peppa has drunk her juice, and now she has hiccups, similar to george. The pig familly starts laughing, Peppa also laughs.)
