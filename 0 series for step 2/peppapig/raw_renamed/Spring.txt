[narrator] ''It is springtime. Grandpa Pig has made a chocolate egg hunt.''

Grandpa Pig: Is everybody ready?

Peppa: No, Grandpa. Freddy Fox isn't here.

[horn honks]

Freddy: [barks] Hello, everyone.

The children except Freddy: Hello, Freddy.

Grandpa Pig: Ah. Mr. Fox. Are you staying?

Mr. Fox: I wish I could. I loved egg hunts when I was a little lad. See you later, Freddy.

[Freddy barks and Mr. Fox drives off]

Grandpa Pig: Now, are we ready for the egg hunt?

The children: [in unison] Yes, Grandpa Pig.

Grandpa Pig: There are lots of chocolate eggs hidden in my garden. You must find them.

Freddy: Easy.

Grandpa Pig: [oinks] But be careful not to step on my little plants. Oh, it's so exciting in springtime to see these baby plants starting to grow.

Peppa: We promise to be careful, Grandpa.

Grandpa Pig: Very good. Off you go, then.

[giggling]

''Grandpa Pig's chocolate egg hunt has begun.''

Granny Pig: Have you got time for a cup of tea, Grandpa Pig?

Grandpa Pig: Ho, ho, yes. It will take them ages to find my eggs. I've hidden them very well.

Peppa: Here's an egg. [oinks]

''Peppa has found a chocolate egg in a plant pot.''

Rebecca: ''Here's another egg.'' [squeaks]

''Rebecca Rabbit has found a chocolate egg hiding under a leafy bush.''

Emily: Hooray, an egg for me. [trumpets]

''Emily Elephant has found a chocolate egg in a branches of a tree.''

[sniffs]

Freddy: I think I can smell chocolate.

''Freddy Fox has a very good sense of smell.''

Freddy: Yes.

''Freddy Fox has found a chocolate egg in the middle of the birdbath.''

[giggling]

Peppa: Grandpa, Grandpa. We found the chocolate eggs.

Emily: It was really fun.

Rebecca: But it was a bit easy.

Grandpa Pig: It wasn't easy for the little ones.

''George, Richard, and Edmond haven't found any eggs.''

[crying]

Grandpa Pig: I wonder where the other eggs are. (egg appears on his head as he lifts his hat) Ho-ho-ho!

George: [oinks] Chocky egg.

Grandpa Pig: Ha-ha-ha!

Richard: [squeaks and giggles]

Grandpa Pig: Ah. Edmond, I think there's something behind your ear.

Edmond: [trumpets and giggles]

''Everyone has found a chocolate egg.''

[giggling]

Rebecca: [squeaks] What do we do now, Grandpa Pig?

Grandpa Pig: Ha, ha! You eat them, of course.

[the children eat their chocolate eggs]

Granny Pig: Hello, children.

Peppa: Granny, Granny. We found all the chocolate eggs.

Granny Pig: Well, where are they? I can't see any eggs.

Peppa: [chuckles]

Freddy: They're in our tummies.

[Granny Pig] And 'round your mouths.

[all laugh and licks the chocolate around their mouths]

Granny Pig: Did Grandpa hide the eggs well?

Emily: No. We big ones found them easily.

Rebecca: But the little ones needed helping.

[the toddlers sigh]

Rebecca: George, Richard, and Edmond don't like to be the littlest ones.

Granny Pig: Don't worry. There'll soon be even littler ones in the garden.

Grandpa Pig: [oinks] Oh, yes. The little babies. It's so exciting.

Peppa: Grandpa already told us about the baby plants, Granny, but it's not that exciting.

Granny Pig: We're not talking about baby plants, Peppa.

Peppa: Oh. What are you talking about?

Granny Pig: Let's go and see Jemima, Vanessa, Sarah, and Neville.

Peppa: They're chickens.

Granny Pig: Yes, and they have eggs, too.

Freddy: Can we eat them?

Granny Pig: No, Freddy. These eggs are about to hatch.

[clucking]

Granny Pig: Oh! We're just in time.

''The baby chicks are hatching.''

[peeping]

The children: [in unison] Aww. Baby chicks.

[Granny Pig] Now the chicks have hatched, it really is springtime.

Peppa: Let's pretend to be baby chicks.
