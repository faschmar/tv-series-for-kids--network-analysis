* '''Narrator:''' It is a lovely, bright, sunny day. [[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa]] and her family are going for a picnic. [[Daddy Pig]] is bringing the picnic basket.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Picnic basket, bread, cheese, tomatoes and lemonade. Is there anything we’ve forgotten?
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Mummy’s strawberry cake.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' I was just teasing. Mummy’s homemade strawberry cake is there too.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Is everybody ready?
* '''[[Mummy Pig]], Peppa Pig and [[George Pig|George]]:''' Ready.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Then let’s go.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' This looks like just the spot for our picnic.
* '''Mummy Pig, Peppa Pig, George:''' Hurrah!
* '''Daddy Pig:''' It’s great to be outdoors. We should run around a bit and get some exercise.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' I want to eat, then have a nap. I certainly don’t want to run around.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Maybe Daddy should run around a bit. His tummy is quite big.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' My tummy is not big. But later I will get some exercise. Even if no one else does.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' Let’s eat.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Good idea, Mummy Pig. I’m really hungry.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Delicious.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Aah, I feel quite sleepy.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' I thought you wanted to run around a bit, Daddy Pig.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Later.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Look, there’s a little duck pond.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Mummy, can we feed the ducks?
* '''Mummy Pig:''' Yes, you can feed them the rest of the bread.
* '''Narrator:''' Peppa and George love feeding bread to ducks.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Mummy, I think they want some more.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' That was the last of the bread. I’m sure they’ve had enough.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Sorry, Mrs Duck. We’ve no more bread.
* '''Narrator:''' The ducks want more food.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' So much for Daddy Pig and his exercise.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' What?
* '''Mummy Pig:''' You lot again? Peppa told you; there’s no more bread.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Mummy, we do have strawberry cake.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' Well, if there’s any cake left over you can give it to the ducks.
* '''Narrator:''' Everybody likes Mummy Pig’s homemade strawberry cake.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' A wasp! I hate wasps. Shoo!
* '''Daddy Pig:''' What a fuss, Mummy Pig. It’s only a little wasp.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' Go away, wasp.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Just stay still, Mummy Pig. Then it will fly away.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' There, you see? All you had to do was stay still.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Get away. Scram.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Help!
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Shoo! Get it off me.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' I hope the wasp doesn’t sting daddy.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Oh, get away, you little pest.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' No, Daddy Pig is running too fast for the wasp to catch him.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Let’s eat our cake before the wasp comes back.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Oh no, we forgot to leave any for the ducks.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' I think I lost it.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' You said you would run around and get some exercise, Daddy Pig, but I didn’t believe you’d do it.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Luckily, I managed to hang on to my slice of strawberry cake.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Stop, Daddy. We promised the rest of the cake for the ducks.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' Oh.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' You’re very lucky ducks. Say thank you to Daddy Pig.
* '''Daddy Pig:''' You’re most welcome.
* '''Mummy Pig:''' It’s time to go home. Say goodbye to the ducks.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Bye-bye, ducks. See you next time.
