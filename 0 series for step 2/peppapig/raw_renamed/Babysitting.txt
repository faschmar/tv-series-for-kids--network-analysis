Narrator: Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are leaving for their evening out.

Granny Pig: Peppa and George are so good. They just fell asleep when Mummy Pig told them to.

Grandpa Pig: This babysitting is easy.

Peppa Pig: George. George, are you awake?

Narrator: What strange noises.

Grandpa Pig: I wonder if we should check upstairs.

Granny Pig: Peppa, George, are you awake?

Granny Pig: Well, I never. Fast asleep.

Grandpa Pig: So, it wasn’t Peppa and George making all that noise.

Granny Pig: I can’t hear anything.

Grandpa Pig: I think they really have fallen asleep. Let’s watch some television.

TV Programme Host: Gardening. Today we are talking about roses.

Grandpa Pig: Oh, I love gardening programs.

TV Programme Host: The kiftsgate is a particularly thorny rose. To prune it, start by lopping off the head, and then snip away the budding shoots.

Peppa Pig: Granny Pig.

Granny Pig: Peppa, George. You should be in bed asleep.

Peppa Pig: George and I aren’t sleepy at all. Can we watch TV with you?

Granny Pig: Well, I suppose watching a little TV might make you sleepy.

Peppa Pig: Hurrah!

TV Programme Host: Icelandic roses are a rare treat for the discerning horticulturist. But they are prone to lobbing in temperate habitats.

Peppa Pig: This programme is very boring.

Peppa Pig: Grandpa Pig, can we play that game where you throw us up and catch us?

Grandpa Pig: OK, but just one turn each.

Grandpa Pig: Whee! You seem heavier than before.

Grandpa Pig: Now it’s George’s turn.

Peppa Pig: My turn.

Peppa Pig: Higher, higher!

Granny Pig: Maybe Grandpa Pig is a bit tired.

Peppa Pig: I know. Granny Pig, let’s play catch.

Granny Pig: Uh...

Peppa Pig: You’re “it.” Catch us if you can.

Peppa Pig: Can’t catch me.

Granny Pig: I’m going to catch you.

Narrator: Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are back home.

Mummy Pig: I hope our little piggies are asleep.

Daddy Pig: Hello. Anyone here?

Daddy Pig: The little piggies are asleep and so are the big piggies.
