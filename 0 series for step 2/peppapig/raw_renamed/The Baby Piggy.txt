(Peppa and her family are driving their car to visit their cousin)

Narrator: Peppa and George are visiting their big cousin, Chloe.

Daddy Pig: *Oink* Today, as well as seeing Chloe, you're going to meet your new cousin!

Peppa and George: *Amazed* Oooooh!

(The family arrive at their cousin's house and beep the horn to signal their horn. Chloe and Uncle Pig exit the house)

Narrator: Peppa and her family have arrived at Chloe's house.

Peppa and her family: Hello!

Uncle Pig: Hello, everyone.

Chloe Pig: *oink* Hello, Peppa and George!

Narrator: This is Chloe: Peppa and George's big cousin.

Peppa Pig: *oink* But where's our new cousin?

Auntie Pig: *Walks out with Baby Alexander* Here's your new baby cousin!

Peppa's Family: Ooooh!

Narrator: The new cousin is a tiny baby piggy!

Baby Alexander: Goo-goo-goooo! *Small, tiny snort*

Mummy Pig: Ooooh how beautiful!

Peppa Pig: Is it a girl baby?

Chloe Pig: No. It's a boy.

Peppa Pig: Oh...I wish it was a girl.

Chloe Pig: Me too!

(George jumps and snorts excitedly, happy hearing the fact the baby is a boy)

Narrator: George is pleased the baby is a boy.

(George runs over to Baby Alexander. Auntie Pig lowers him so he can interact with him easier)

George: Dinosaur! Grrrr!

(Baby Alexander becomes startled, Richard rabbit crying as a result)

Mummy Pig: *picks up George* I think the baby is too little to play with dinosaurs.

Peppa Pig: *Runs up to baby Alexander* George, the baby doesn't want to play with you, it wants to play with me!

(Peppa bounces her ball twice, creating a loud noise and startles Baby Alexander again, causing him to Richard rabbit cry two times)

Mummy Pig: Peppa, the baby is much too little to play ball games!

Peppa Pig: But if it can't play with a dinosaur or a ball, what can it do?

Chloe Pig: It eats and it sleeps...

(Baby Alexander burps all of a sudden)

Chloe Pig: *pointing* ...And it does that.

(Every pig except for Baby Alexander laughs)

Peppa Pig: *oink* Auntie Pig, can I hold the baby?

Auntie Pig: *giving Peppa Baby Alexander* Yes, if you're very careful, you can hold Alexander.

Peppa Pig: Alexander?!

Auntie Pig: That's his name; Baby Alexander!

Narrator: What a big name for such a small piggy.

Peppa Pig: It's quite nice, even though it's a boy!

Baby Alexander: Goo-goo-goo!

(Baby Alexander's face goes red. Peppa smells something all of a sudden and becomes disgusted)

Peppa Pig: Ohhhhh! What's that smell?!

(Peppa hands him back to her Aunt)

Auntie Pig: Maybe...Alexander's nappy needs changing.

Peppa Pig: *Rubbing her dress in disgust* Uggghhh! Disgusting!

Daddy Pig: *Walks over to Peppa* Peppa, when you were a baby, you wore nappies.

Peppa Pig: *putting her arms on her waist, crossly* I did not!

(Everyone else laughs, except for Baby Alexander)

Chloe Pig: Mummy? Can I play with Peppa and George in the garden?

Auntie Pig: *oink* Yes!

(Chloe throws Peppa's ball down the hill. She, Peppa and George run to Chloe's toy shed, giggling)

(They stop outside the door of the shed)

Peppa: Chloe is it nice having a little baby brother?

Chloe Pig: Yes, Alexander is very sweet.

Peppa: *oink*  I wish George was a sweet little baby piggy.

Chloe Pig: I know, George can pretend to be a baby piggy. He can go in my doll's pram. 

Peppa: That's a good idea.

George : No!

Narrator: George does not want to be a baby.

Peppa: George, if you pretend to be a baby, I promise to be nice to you forever and ever.

Narrator: George is thinking.

Chloe Pig: And you can play with all my toys.

Narrator: George is thinking more.

Peppa: And when we get home, you can play with all my toys.

George: *oink* *giggle*

Narrator: George has decided.

George: Goo-goo-goo.

Chloe Pig: What a sweet baby piggy.

George: *giggle*
