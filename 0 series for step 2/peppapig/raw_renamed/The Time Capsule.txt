Peppa Pig: Oh, but I can’t wait that long.

Madame Gazelle: Peppa, you are just like your daddy when he was little.

Daddy Pig, Mummy Pig, [[Mummy Sheep]], [[Mummy Rabbit]], [[Mummy Dog]], [[Mr. Zebra]], [[Mummy Pony]], [[Mummy Cat]]: Yes, Madame Gazelle.

Madame Gazelle: When your mummies and daddies were little, they made a time capsule too.

Peppa Pig: Can we dig it up?

Madame Gazelle: Yes. I think we buried it over here.

Daddy Pig: Oh, I thought it was a much smaller tree.

Madame Gazelle: It was a long time ago. The tree has grown a bit since then.

Daddy Pig: I’ve found something.

Daddy Pig: It’s our old time capsule.

All the Parents and Children: Hurrah!

Daddy Pig: I can’t wait to open it.

Madame Gazelle: Stand back, children.

All the Parents and Children: Yes, Madame Gazelle.

Madame Gazelle: What do we have here?

Madame Gazelle: An old comic.

Daddy Pig: That was my favorite comic.

Madame Gazelle: A tin toy.

Mummy Dog: My favorite toy.

Madame Gazelle: Music.

Mummy Sheep: My favorite record.

Madame Gazelle: And a very old carrot.

Mummy Rabbit: That’s mine.

Rebecca Rabbit: What a good choice, Mummy.

Madame Gazelle: And a videotape of your mummies and daddies when they were little.

The Children: Ooh!

Peppa Pig: Who’s the little piggy in the glasses?

Mummy Pig: Aw, that’s Daddy Pig.

Mummy Pig: Oh, and that’s me.

Little Daddy Pig: Hello to the future.

Peppa Pig: What a squeaky voice you have.
