Daddy Pig: Maybe we can get you a dinosaur balloon.

Mummy Pig: Are you sure they have dinosaur balloons, Daddy Pig?

Daddy Pig: I’m certain of it.

Peppa Pig: Can George and I get our faces painted first?

Daddy Pig: Of course.

Narrator: Miss Rabbit has painted Peppa’s friends as tigers.

Miss Rabbit: There you are, Suzy. Now you look like a tiger.

Suzy Sheep: Thank you, Miss Rabbit.

Peppa Pig: Wow! I like your face, Suzy. Are you a pussy cat?

Suzy Sheep: No. I’m a tiger.

Miss Rabbit: Peppa, would you like your face painted?

Peppa Pig: Yes, please. Can I be...an elephant?

Miss Rabbit: Oh, dear. I don’t know how to do elephants. I can do tigers.

Peppa Pig: Yes, a tiger please.

Miss Rabbit: There you are, Peppa. Now you’re a tiger.

Peppa Pig: I’m a tiger.

Miss Rabbit: George, what would you like to be?

George: Dinosaur, grrr.

Miss Rabbit: A dinosaur? How about a tiger instead? I’m good at tigers.

Peppa Pig: I’m a tiger.

Danny Dog: So am I, woof-woof.

Candy Cat: Tigers don’t say “woof-woof.”

Danny Dog: How do you know?

Candy Cat: Because tigers are big cats, and I’m a cat.

Peppa Pig: Candy, please can you teach us how to be tigers?

Candy Cat: OK. Tigers creep very very slowly. And then they jump.

Candy Cat: Tigers like to lick themselves clean.

Candy Cat: But best of all, when tigers are happy they purr.

Mummy Pig: Hello, children. My goodness, you’re all tigers.

Candy Cat: And I’m teaching them to be proper tigers.

Mummy Pig: What do you little tigers want to do next?

George: Dinosaur.

Daddy Pig: That’s right. We have to find George a dinosaur balloon.

Mummy Pig: Let’s get you all balloons.

Children: Hurrah!

Mummy Pig: Hello, Madame Gazelle. We’d like some balloons, please.

Madame Gazelle: Certainly. I’ve got lots of different ones.

Peppa Pig: Can I have an elephant balloon, please?

Madame Gazelle: Here you are, Peppa.

Suzy Sheep: Can I have a kangaroo?

Danny Dog: A lion, please.

Rebecca Rabbit: A monkey, please.

Pedro Pony: A parrot, please.

Madame Gazelle: Yes, I’ve got all those.

Daddy Pig: Most important of all, we need a dinosaur balloon for George.

Madame Gazelle: Oh, dear. I do not seem to have any dinosaur balloons.

Daddy Pig: Oh.

(George Pig cries)

Daddy Pig: Don’t worry, George. I’ve got an idea.

Daddy Pig: Could we have two of the long balloons, please?

Daddy Pig: Watch this, everybody.

Narrator: What is Daddy Pig doing with the balloons?

Daddy Pig: There. Can anyone guess what it is?

Suzy Sheep: Is it a kangaroo?

Daddy Pig: No, it’s a...

George: Dinosaur.
