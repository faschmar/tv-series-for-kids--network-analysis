{{Super Episode Template}}Narrator: [[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa]] and [[George Pig|George]] are going to the playground today.

[[Daddy Pig]]: Should we drive to the playground?

[[Mummy Pig]]: No, let’s walk.

Peppa Pig: Look. It’s just over there.

Narrator: The playground is quite close.

Daddy Pig: OK, let’s walk.

Mummy Pig: This way, everyone.

Peppa Pig: We’re going to the playground. We’re going to the playground.

Peppa Pig: Oh. Where has the sky gone?

Daddy Pig: Don’t worry, Peppa. It’s just fog.

Peppa Pig: What’s fog?

Daddy Pig: Fog is a cloud that is on the ground instead of in the sky.

Mummy Pig: It’s very thick fog.

Peppa Pig: I can’t see a thing.

Daddy Pig: Mmmm... maybe we should go back home.

Mummy Pig: Yes, we’ll go to the playground another day.

Peppa Pig and George: Oh.

Narrator: It is too foggy to find the playground, so Peppa and George have to go back home.

Daddy Pig: Now, which way is home?

Mummy Pig: Are we lost, Daddy Pig?

Daddy Pig: Don’t worry. I know exactly where we are.

Daddy Pig: This way.

Daddy Pig: Oof! Who put that tree there?

Narrator: Daddy Pig has walked into a tree.

Mummy Pig: Are you okay, Daddy Pig?

Daddy Pig: Yes, I’m fine.

Daddy Pig: This way.

Mummy Pig: Daddy Pig, do you know where you’re going?

Daddy Pig: Yes, of course I do.

Peppa Pig: I don’t think we’ll ever find our house again.

Daddy Pig: I’m sure we will, Peppa.

Daddy Pig: We’re only in our garden.

[[Mrs. Duck]]: Quack, quack, quack.

Peppa Pig: Oh, it’s the ducks.

Mrs. Duck: Quack, quack.

Peppa Pig: Hello, Mrs Duck. Have you lost your pond?

Mrs. Duck: Quack.

Peppa Pig: We’re lost too.

Daddy Pig: We are not lost. I know exactly where we are.

Daddy Pig: See you later, ducks. Good luck finding your pond.

Peppa and Mummy Pig: Oh!

Narrator: Daddy Pig has found the duck pond.

Peppa Pig: That’s lucky.

Daddy Pig: Yes, what a stroke of luck.

Mrs Duck: Quack, quack.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, Mrs Duck says, “Thank you.”

Daddy Pig: You’re most welcome, Mrs Duck.

Daddy Pig: Now, let’s find our house.

Daddy Pig: I’m sure it’s this way.

[[Mummy Rabbit]]: Hello.

Daddy Pig: Did you hear something?

Mummy Pig: Yes. I thought I hear someone say...

Mummy Rabbit: Hello.

Narrator: It’s Mummy Rabbit with [[Rebecca Rabbit (character)|Rebecca]] and [[Richard Rabbit|Richard]].

Rebecca: Hello, Peppa. We’re lost.

Peppa Pig: Hello, Rebecca. We’re lost too.

Rebecca: We wanted to go to the playground.

Peppa Pig: So did we, but it’s too foggy to get there.

Daddy Pig: Come on, everyone. Back to our house until the fog clears.

Mummy Pig: Daddy Pig, do you know where you’re going?

Daddy Pig: Yes, of course I do.

Daddy Pig: This way.

Everyone (except Daddy Pig): Yes, Daddy Pig.

Daddy Pig: Aha! I’ve found our little hill.

Daddy Pig: We’ll soon be home.

Everyone (except Daddy Pig): Hurrah!

Daddy Pig: Our house should be just about... here.

Daddy Pig: Oh?

Narrator: Daddy Pig has found a ladder.

Daddy Pig: That’s strange. We don’t have a ladder in our garden.

Daddy Pig: Goodness me!

Mummy Pig: Can you see where we are, Daddy Pig?

Daddy Pig: Yes, I can.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, where are we?

Daddy Pig: Why don’t you have a look?

Peppa Pig: Okay.

Peppa Pig: Wow!

Rebecca: Wow! I can see everything again.

Narrator: The fog is going away.

Peppa Pig: We’re at the playground.

Peppa Pig and Rebecca: Hurrah!

Peppa Pig: Whee!

Peppa Pig: We’re at the playground. We’re at the playground.

Rebecca: Whee!

Richard: Seesaw

George: Seesaw.

Peppa Pig: Daddy! Mummy! We’re at the playground.

Mummy Pig: Well, that’s lucky. But I thought we were trying to get home.

Daddy Pig: So did I.

Daddy Pig: Maybe we did get a bit lost after all.
