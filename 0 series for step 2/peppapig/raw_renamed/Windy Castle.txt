{{Super Episode Template}}Narrator: [[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa]] and her family are going out for the day.

[[Daddy Pig]]: Peppa, [[George Pig|George]], today we’re going to [[Windy Castle (location)|Windy Castle]].

Peppa Pig: What’s Windy Castle, Daddy?

Daddy Pig: It’s a castle on a very high hill.

Narrator: George likes castles.

Peppa Pig: Windy Castle sounds like a boring thing, for boys.

Daddy Pig: No, Peppa. You’ll love it. There’s a great view from the top of Windy Castle. You can even see [[Granny and Grandpa Pig|Granny and Grandpa]]’s house.

Peppa Pig: Wow! Let’s go.

Daddy Pig: I’ll map read and [[Mummy Pig]] will drive.

Mummy Pig: Are you sure Daddy Pig? When you map read we always get lost and you get grumpy.

Daddy Pig: We will not get lost, and I will not get grumpy.

Mummy Pig: Windy Castle, here we come.

Peppa Pig: Are we nearly there yet?

Daddy Pig: Not quite.

Peppa Pig: Oh.

Daddy Pig: Would you like to play a game?

Peppa Pig: Yes, please. Let’s play I Spy.

Daddy Pig: OK. I’ll go first.

Narrator: Daddy Pig has to secretly look at something and the others have to guess what it is.

Daddy Pig: I spy with my little eye something colored red.

Peppa Pig: Red. My dress. That’s red.

Daddy Pig: No, it’s not your dress.

Peppa Pig: Hmm? The car.

Daddy Pig: That’s right, our red car.

Peppa Pig: My go. I spy with my little eye something blue.

Daddy Pig: Hmm. George’s blue shirt.

Peppa Pig: No.

Mummy Pig: Is it something in the car?

Peppa Pig: No. Give up?

Daddy Pig: Yes.

Peppa Pig: The sky. The blue sky. I win.

Mummy Pig: Daddy Pig, do you know where we are?

Daddy Pig: I know exactly where we are. Although, this road doesn’t look the same as it does on this map.

Mummy Pig: Oh, Daddy Pig. We’re lost.

Daddy Pig: We are not lost.

Mummy Pig: So how do we get to Windy Castle from here?

Daddy Pig: Just give me a moment. Hmm.

Mummy Pig: I know. We can ring Granny and Grandpa.

Daddy Pig: There’s no need to ring Granny and Grandpa. I’ll get us to Windy Castle if it takes me all day.

Mummy Pig: We haven’t got all day.

Grandpa Pig: Hello, Grandpa Pig speaking.

Mummy Pig: Grandpa Pig, we’ve got a bit lost on the way to Windy Castle.

Grandpa Pig: Is Daddy Pig doing the map reading?

Mummy Pig: Yes, Daddy Pig is doing the map reading and he’s a bit grumpy at the moment.

Daddy Pig: I am not grumpy.

Grandpa Pig: This is the best route. Keep on the main road until you see Windy Castle up ahead.

Mummy Pig: Thank you, Grandpa Pig.

Mummy Pig: We follow the main road and look out for Windy Castle.

Daddy Pig: As I thought.

Peppa Pig: Look. Is that a castle?

Daddy Pig: Yes. It’s Windy Castle.

Mummy Pig: Come on, car.

Peppa Pig: Go on, car. You can make it.

Daddy Pig, Mummy Pig, Peppa Pig: Hurrah!

Narrator: Peppa and her family have arrived at Windy Castle.

Peppa Pig: Wow, it’s so tall.

Daddy Pig: Let’s go inside. The view from the top is fantastic.

Peppa Pig: Wow!

Mummy Pig: Look at the view.

Peppa Pig: Mummy, is that Granny and Grandpa’s house?

Mummy Pig: Yes, it is.

Peppa Pig: It’s so far away.

Daddy Pig: Let’s take a look through the telescope.

Peppa Pig: Can I look first, please?

Daddy Pig: Yes, but you must let George look next.

Peppa Pig: Wow!

Narrator: The telescope makes everything look bigger.

Peppa Pig: I can see Granny and Grandpa.

Peppa Pig: Look, George.

George: Dankey ‘ig, Papa ‘ig.

Narrator: George is waving at Granny and Grandpa.

Peppa Pig: Silly George. Granny and Grandpa are too far away to see you waving.

Mummy Pig: I know. We can ring them.

Grandpa Pig: Hello.

Mummy Pig: Grandpa Pig, we can see you from Windy Castle. Wave at us.

Peppa Pig: Granny and Grandpa are waving at us.

Peppa Pig: I love Windy Castle.
