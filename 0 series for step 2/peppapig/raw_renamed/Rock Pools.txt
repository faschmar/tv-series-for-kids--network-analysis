* '''Peppa Pig:''' A seashell.
* '''Granny Pig:''' Can you hear the sea in it?
* '''Peppa Pig:''' What do you mean?
* '''Granny Pig:''' If you put a shell to your ear you can hear the sea.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' Wow! I can hear the sea. I love my seashell.
* '''Granny Pig:''' George, can you find a seashell too?
* '''George:''' Shell.
* '''Peppa Pig:''' That’s not a shell.
* '''George:''' Oh.
* '''Grandpa Pig:''' Peppa’s right. That’s not a shell. George has found a fossil.
