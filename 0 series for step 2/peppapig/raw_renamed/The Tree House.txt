Granny Pig: Peppa, George, look what I’ve made. Little curtains.

Peppa and George: Oo-oo.

Peppa Pig: What are the little curtains for, Granny?

Granny Pig: It’s a surprise. Do you want to see what Grandpa Pig has made for you in the garden?

Peppa Pig: Yes, please.

Peppa Pig: Grandpa Pig!

George: Papa ‘ig!

Grandpa Pig: Hello, Peppa, George. Look what I’ve made for you. A tree house.

Peppa Pig: Hurrah!

Narrator: Peppa and George love their tree house.

Peppa Pig: Thank you, Granny Pig. Thank you, Grandpa Pig.

Grandpa Pig: Who wants to go inside first?

Peppa Pig: Me, me!

Grandpa Pig: In you go then.

Peppa Pig: Before I go in my tree house I must take off my muddy boots.

Peppa Pig: I’m in my tree house.

Peppa Pig: I’m in my tree house.

[[Daddy Pig]]: George, would you like to go in the tree house, too?

Peppa Pig: Yes, who is it?

Daddy Pig: A young pig named George would like to pay a visit. Can he come in?

Peppa Pig: As long as he takes off his muddy boots.

Daddy Pig: George, take your boots off. Then you can visit Peppa in the tree house.

Peppa Pig: Who is it?

Peppa Pig: George?

Peppa Pig: Yes, who is it?

[[Mummy Pig]]: It’s Mummy Pig. Have you room for any more visitors?

Peppa Pig: Mmm? You have to say the secret words. Then you can come into our house.

Mummy Pig: I see. And what are the secret words?

Peppa Pig: I have to whisper them to you. The secret words are: “Daddy’s big tummy.”

Mummy Pig: I see.

Peppa Pig: Say the secret words.

Mummy Pig: Daddy’s big tummy.

Peppa Pig: That’s right! Daddy’s big tummy!

Daddy Pig: I think those are silly secret words.

Peppa Pig: Mummy, before you come in our house you must take off your boots.

Mummy Pig: Of course.

Peppa Pig: There’s room for Daddy, too.

Peppa Pig: Say the secret words, Daddy.

Daddy Pig: Can I have different secret words, please?

Mummy Pig, Peppa Pig and George: No.

Daddy Pig: Oh, all right.

Daddy Pig: Daddy’s big tummy.

Peppa Pig: That’s right. You can come in now, Daddy. Take your boots off.

Daddy Pig: I don’t think I can fit through the door.

Peppa Pig: That’s because your tummy’s too big.

Grandpa Pig: I know. Daddy Pig can climb in through the top.

Narrator: Peppa, George, Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are all in the tree house.

Peppa Pig: Granny, I love our tree house. I don’t want to ever come out.

Granny Pig: That’s nice, Peppa. But are you sure you don’t want to visit me in my house?

Peppa Pig: No, thank you, Granny.

Granny Pig: In that case Grandpa Pig and I will just have to eat my homemade cookies all by ourselves.

Peppa Pig: Cookies!

Peppa Pig: Granny Pig!

Granny Pig: Here are my homemade cookies. But if you want to come in you have to say the secret words.

Peppa Pig: That’s easy. Daddy’s big tummy!

Granny Pig: That’s right.

Daddy Pig: Well I still think that those are very silly secret words.
