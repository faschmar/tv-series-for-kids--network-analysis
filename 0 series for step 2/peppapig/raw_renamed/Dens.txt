(Richard & George are crying.)

Grandpa Pig: What's wrong?

Pedro: The girls won't let us into the tree house.

Danny: (Barks.) It isn't fair.

Grandpa Pig: (Laughs.) I think I can help. Come over here. (They're all going to build another den.)

Peppa: (She opens the door without noticed. Until, she closed the door.) Now we can have a nice, quiet tea party. (They're all laughing. But then, Grandpa Pig is using some tools to build a castle fort.) What's that noise?

Grandpa Pig: (He finished making his castle fort.) There! Now you boys have your very own den with it's very own drawbridge. (Turning the pulley to make the drawbridge open.)

Danny: No, this is a boys den. For boys only. (Closing the drawbridge door.)

Zoe: But, I love castles.

Peppa: Castles aren't as good as tree houses. (Snorts.) Come on, girls.

Danny: (Singing.) I'm the king of the castle! (Giggles.)

Grandpa Pig: (Turning the pulley to make the flag appear.) Every castle needs a flag.

Pedro, Richard, George & Danny: Wow!

Suzy: (Opens the door.) They've got a flag!

Peppa: We don't need a silly flag.

Narrator: Here is Granny Pig.

Granny Pig: Hello, girls. Can I get you anything?

Peppa, Rebecca, Suzy & Zoe: A flag, please!

Peppa: And it must be better than the boys flag.

Granny Pig: I'll see what I can do.

Danny: (Singing.) I'm the king of the castle!

Grandpa Pig: (Chuckles.) Every castle need a telephone. (Snorts, while he picks up a telephone cans & give it to Peppa.) Hold this. Keep this string nice and tight. And you can talk to the boys.

Peppa: (Calling into the can-phone.) We don't want to talk to the boys.

Danny: (Calling into the can-phone.) We don't want to talk to the girls. (Blows raspberry.)

Peppa: (Blows raspberry.)

Narrator: Granny Pig has found a flag for the girls den.

Granny Pig: This dress will make a pretty flag.

Peppa: (Snorts, until she is gonna put a flag right here.) Thank you, Granny.

Suzy: Is isn't as good as the boys flag.

Rebecca: I wish we were in the castle.

Zoe: Fairy princesses live in castles.

Peppa: If I were a fairy princess, I would live in a tree house.

Suzy: (Calling into the can-phone.) Can we come over? Please?!

Danny: (Calling into the can-phone.) Only if you say, "The castle is the best."

Suzy: (Calling into the can-phone.) It is the best!

(They're all laughing about coming in to the castle. Except, Peppa who is staying in the tree house.)

Peppa: I'm staying in my tree house.

Suzy: (Danny turns the pulley to make the drawbridge open. As the girls laughing that they come in their castle, while closing it. Bleats) I love the castle.

(They're all laughing that they've loved our castle. But suddenly, the rain has falling.)

Narrator: Oh, dear. It is raining. And the castle has no roof.

Peppa: (She closes the door.)

Pedro: Let's go to the tree house.

Danny: No, I'll never leave my castle.

(They were all giggle because they wanted to back into the tree house. Except, Danny was not very happy about leaving a castle fort. But then, the rain stopped so the puddles were there.)

Narrator: The rain has stopped.

George: (He opens the door & found something really special. It was a [[Muddy Puddles (objects)|muddy puddle]] splashing up & down with rain boots when he giggled.)

Narrator: George has found a muddy puddle.

Suzy: That looks fun.

(They were all giggle because they liked jumping up & down in muddy puddles. Except, Peppa & Danny stayed in their dens.)

Danny: I'm staying in my tree castle.

Peppa: I'm staying in my tree house.

Grandpa Pig: (Laughs.) I'll look after you castle, Danny.

Granny Pig: I'll look after you tree house, Peppa.

(As they both giggle, while they're jumping jump & down in muddy puddles.)
