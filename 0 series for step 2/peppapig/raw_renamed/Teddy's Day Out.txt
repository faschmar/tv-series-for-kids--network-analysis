Zoë Zebra: I’ve got a toy picnic set. Let’s play picnics.

Zoë Zebra: We’ve got pretend orange juice.

Peppa Pig: And we’ve got pretend cake.

Zoë Zebra: It’s pretend cake. It’s very nice.

Narrator: Oh, dear. I do not think the ducks want pretend cake.

Peppa Pig: Oh, well. That means there’s more for Monkey, Mr Dinosaur and Teddy.

Peppa Pig: (as Teddy) Delicious.

Zoë Zebra: Monkey says, “The best cake ever.”

Mummy Pig: Peppa, George, home time.

Peppa Pig: Bye-bye, Zoë.

Daddy Pig: Are we all ready?

Mummy Pig, Peppa Pig, George: Yes, Daddy Pig.

Zoë Zebra: Yes, Daddy. Cups, plates, Monkey, Teddy. Oh, no. You shouldn’t be here, Teddy.

Narrator: Peppa has forgotten her teddy, again.

Narrator: Peppa and her family are home.

Daddy Pig: Ah, that’s enough driving for one day. All I want to do now is relax, put my feet up and watch some...

Peppa Pig: Teddy! I forgot Teddy!

Mummy Pig: Oh, Peppa. Now Daddy Pig will have to drive all the way back to the picnic spot.

Daddy Pig: Uh, yes, of course.

Peppa Pig: It’s Mr Zebra, the postman.

Daddy Pig: I thought it was your day off today, Mr Zebra.

Mr Zebra: It is my day off, but Zoë’s got a very special delivery for a Miss Peppa Pig.

Zoë Zebra: Here you are, Peppa.

Peppa Pig: What is it?

Peppa Pig: It’s Teddy!

Zoë Zebra: You left Teddy behind. So we brought him home.

Peppa Pig: Thank you, Zoë.

Mummy Pig: Teddy certainly has had an exciting day out, but Peppa, you really must take better care of him.

Peppa Pig: Yes, Mummy. You are a very naughty bear. You must promise not to wander off ever again.

Peppa Pig: (as Teddy) Sorry, Peppa. I promise.
