{{Super Episode Template}}Narrator: [[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa]] and [[George Pig|George]] are going to the playgroup. It is George’s first day.

[[Daddy Pig]]: George, are you looking forward to the playgroup?

George: Oink, oink.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, maybe George is too small to go to my playgroup.

Daddy Pig: He’ll be fine, Peppa. There’ll be you and [[Mr. Dinosaur]] there to keep him company.

George: Grrr, Dinosaur.

Peppa Pig: But I want to play with the big children, not George and his toy dinosaur.

Narrator: Oh, dear. Peppa doesn’t want George to go to her playgroup.

Daddy Pig: We’re here.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, are you sure George is big enough?

Daddy Pig: He’ll be fine.

Peppa Pig: All right, he can come.

Daddy Pig: Bye-bye.

Narrator: [[Madame Gazelle]] looks after the children at the playgroup.

Peppa Pig: Hello. This is my little brother George.

Madame Gazelle: Hello, George.

[[Suzy Sheep]]: I wish I had a little brother like George.

Peppa Pig: Really?

[[Danny Dog]]: Hello, I’m Danny Dog. Is that a dinosaur?

Peppa Pig: It’s just a toy dinosaur.

George: Grrr, dinosaur.

Danny Dog: Brilliant.

George: Dinosaur, grrr.

[[Candy Cat]], [[Suzy Sheep]] and [[Rebecca Rabbit (character)|Rebecca Rabbit]]: Ahh....!

George: Dinosaur, grrr.

Madame Gazelle: Ahh...! Really scary.

Danny Dog: That’s brilliant.

Peppa Pig: George is my brother. He’s brilliant.

Narrator: Peppa is proud of her little brother George.

Madame Gazelle: Shall we show George how we paint pictures?

Peppa Pig: George is not very good at painting.

Madame Gazelle: Well, maybe you could help him.

Peppa Pig: Yes, I’m very good. I will show him how to paint a flower.

Peppa Pig: George, today I’m going to teach you how to paint a flower.

George: Oink, oink.

Peppa Pig: First you paint a big circle.

Peppa Pig: No, George. That’s the wrong colour.

Peppa Pig: Now you paint the flower’s petals.

Peppa Pig: George, that’s the wrong shape.

Peppa Pig: Now you paint the stalk and the leaves.

Peppa Pig: Perfect.

Peppa Pig: George, you’ve done it all wrong.

Madame Gazelle: Now, what do we have here?

Peppa Pig: I’ve painted a flower.

Madame Gazelle: That’s very good, Peppa. And George has painted a dinosaur.

George: Grrr, dinosaur.

Danny Dog: Brilliant.

Madame Gazelle: I think George and Peppa’s pictures should go on the wall.

The Children: Hurrah!

Madame Gazelle: Peppa, you must be very proud of your little brother.

Peppa Pig: Yes, I am.

Narrator: It is home time, and the children’s parents are here to pick them up.

Peppa Pig: Can George come next time?

Madame Gazelle: Yes, and he can paint us another lovely picture. And what will you paint next time, George?

George: Dinosaur, grrr.

Madame Gazelle: Another dinosaur picture? Well, maybe you can show us all how to paint a dinosaur.

Danny Dog: Brilliant.

Peppa Pig: Yes, brilliant.

George: Brilliant.
