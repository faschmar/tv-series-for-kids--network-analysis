Grandpa Pig: I’m planting these seeds.

Peppa Pig: Seeds? What are seeds for?

Grandpa Pig: Seeds grow into plants.

Grandpa Pig: Exactly.

Peppa Pig: Grandpa, Grandpa, I want to plant a seed.

Grandpa Pig: Would you like to plant a strawberry seed?

Peppa Pig: Yes, please.

Grandpa Pig: This seed will grow into a lovely strawberry plant.

Grandpa Pig: I just make a little hole.

Peppa Pig: Then I put the seed in and cover it with earth.

Grandpa Pig: Shall I water it for you?

Peppa Pig: No, no. I want to water it.

Grandpa Pig: Good. Now we wait for it to grow.

Narrator: Peppa and George are waiting for the seed to grow.

Peppa Pig: It’s not doing anything.

[[Mummy Pig]]: Peppa, George, it’s time to go home.

Peppa Pig: But we’re waiting for my strawberry plant to grow. I wanted strawberries for tea.

Grandpa Pig: Don’t worry, Peppa. Next time you come, the seed will have grown into a plant.
