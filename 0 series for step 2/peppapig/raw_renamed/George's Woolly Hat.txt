* Grandpa Pig: Yes yes, Granny Pig, it'll be fine.
* Narrator: Peppa and George had found a large pile of manure.
* Peppa Pig: Ew! What's this, Grandpa?
* Grandpa Pig: That is manure. Wonderful stuff. I put in my vegetables to make them grow big and strong.

* Grandpa Pig: I see two little piggies who need a bath.
* ''[George and Peppa laugh]''
* Narrator: George's hat is on top of some reeds in the pond.
* Grandpa Pig: Lucky for us, your hat is still clean, George.
* Peppa Pig: But how do we get it?
* Grandpa Pig: This is a job for a grownup. Mmm. I will need a stick.

* ''[All laugh]''
* Granny Pig: Grandpa Pig, what on Earth are you doing?
* Grandpa Pig: I'm having a cup of tea.
* Granny Pig: No you are not.
* Grandpa Pig: Of course I'm not! That was a joke. It is perfectly clear to see that I have fallen into the pond.
* Granny Pig: That was a silly thing to do. Peppa, George, you're both covered in mud, too.
* Peppa Pig: We were trying to get George's hat back, Granny.

* Grandpa Pig: I will use a stick.
* Granny Pig: Thank you, everyone, but it's perfectly fine. I've got boots on.
* Grandpa Pig: If you walk on the manure, you will sink!
* Granny Pig: Hush Grandpa, I have no intention of sinking. I can reach it. Got it! Ah! ''[sinks into the manure]''
* Narrator: Oh dear, Granny Pig is covered in manure.
* Peppa Pig: Ooh, smelly Granny Pig.
* ''[All laugh]''
* Narrator: Mummy Pig has come to pick up Peppa and George.
* Grandpa Pig: Hello.
* Mummy Pig: Grandpa Pig, I thought you promised not to let the children get muddy.
* Grandpa Pig: I think you will find we promised not to let George's ''hat'' get muddy.
* Peppa Pig: And it's not muddy.
* Granny Pig: It's perfectly clean.
* ''[George giggles]''

* ''[All laugh]''
