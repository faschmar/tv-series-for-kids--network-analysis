Narrator: [[Mummy Pig]] and [[Daddy Pig]] have a new picture of [[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa]] and [[George Pig|George]].

Mummy Pig: We should put this lovely new picture on the wall.

Daddy Pig: Leave it to me. I am the DIY expert of the house.

Mummy Pig: Are you sure you can do it?

Daddy Pig: Of course. I’ll just put a nail in the wall and hang the picture on it.

Mummy Pig: Very good. I’m just off to visit [[Granny and Grandpa Pig]]. I’ll see you later.

Mummy Pig: And, please don’t make a mess.

Daddy Pig: Mess? Ho-ho-ho.

Mummy Pig: Bye.

Daddy Pig and Peppa Pig: Goodbye.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, can we help put up the picture?

Daddy Pig: You can watch, and then you’ll learn how to do it properly.

Daddy Pig: First, I need a tape measure and a pencil.

Daddy Pig: That is where I’m going to put the nail.

Peppa Pig: Don’t break the wall, Daddy.

Daddy Pig: Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho. Now I need a hammer and a nail.

Daddy Pig: Stand back, children, and watch a craftsman at work.

Narrator: Daddy Pig is going to knock the nail into the wall.

Peppa Pig: Don’t break the wall, Daddy.

Daddy Pig: Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, don’t be silly, Peppa.

Daddy Pig: Easy as pie.

Daddy Pig: Oh, it’s not meant to do that.

Narrator: Daddy Pig has made a big crack in the wall.

Peppa Pig: Oh, Daddy, you’ve broken the wall.

Daddy Pig: It’s just a tiny crack. The picture will hide it. There.

Peppa Pig: I can still see the crack, Daddy.

Daddy Pig: Yes. I’ll just take the nail out and fill in the crack.

Peppa Pig: Don’t make a mess, Daddy.

Daddy Pig: Ho-ho, don’t be silly, Peppa. It’s coming out...

Peppa Pig: Oh, Daddy. Now you really have broken the wall.

Daddy Pig: Hmmm.

Peppa Pig: Do you think Mummy will notice?

Daddy Pig: Yes, I think she might.

Peppa Pig: Quick, George.

Daddy Pig: What are they doing?

Peppa Pig: Daddy, we can see you.

Narrator: Daddy Pig has to mend the wall before Mummy Pig comes home.

Daddy Pig: Brick, please.

Narrator: First, Daddy Pig fills the hole with bricks.

Daddy Pig: There.

Narrator: Next, Daddy Pig puts plaster over the bricks.

Daddy Pig: Ho-ho-ho, easy as pie.

Narrator: Then Daddy Pig paints the wall.

Daddy Pig: Good as new.

Narrator: The wall is mended.

Peppa Pig: Hurrah!

Narrator: But look at all the mess they have made.

Daddy Pig: Goodness me. We’d better clean up before Mummy comes back.

Narrator: First, Daddy Pig quickly washes Peppa and George. Then Peppa vacuums the floor. And Daddy Pig tidies up the tools.

George: (gasps) Mummy.

Narrator: Mummy Pig is home.

George: (snorts) Mummy.

Peppa Pig: (gasps) Mummy’s here.

Daddy Pig: Quick! Pretend nothing has happened.

Mummy Pig: Hello.

Daddy Pig: Hello.

Mummy Pig: What have you been doing?

Daddy Pig: Oh, nothing.

Mummy Pig: Yes, I can see you’ve been doing nothing. I thought you were going to put the picture up.

Narrator: In all the excitement Daddy Pig has forgotten to put the picture up.

Daddy Pig: Oh.

Mummy Pig: Well, I’m no expert, but I’m sure it’s quite easy.

Mummy Pig: There.

Daddy Pig: Hmmm. Yes, that did look quite easy.

Peppa Pig: But when you did it, Daddy, it looked really hard.

Daddy Pig: Shh, Peppa. Don’t tell anyone.
