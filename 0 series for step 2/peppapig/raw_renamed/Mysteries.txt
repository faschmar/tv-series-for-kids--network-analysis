* Narrator: [[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa]] and her family are watching their favourite television programme, Detective Potato.
* [[Mr. Potato|Detective Potato]]: I am Detective Potato, the world famous detective.
* Daddy Pig, Mummy Pig, Peppa Pig and George: Oo-oo.
* [[Mademoiselle Potato]]: Please help me, Mr Detective. I cannot find my flower anywhere.
* Detective Potato: Hmm, your flower is on the top of your head.
* Mademoiselle Potato: Oh, thank you, Mr. Detective.
* Peppa Pig: That was easy. I could do that.
* [[Daddy Pig]]: I’m sure you could, Peppa.
* Peppa Pig: Daddy, when I grow up I want to be a famous detective.
* Narrator: George wants to be a detective too.
* Daddy Pig: If you’re going to be detectives, you’ll each need a hat. Detectives always wear hats.
* Daddy Pig: Now you look like two proper detectives.
* Peppa Pig: And we need one of those funny things that makes everything look big.
* [[Mummy Pig]]: A magnifying glass. I think we’ve got one in the kitchen drawer.
* Mummy Pig: Here we are. A real magnifying glass.
* Peppa Pig: Wow. How does it work?
* Mummy Pig: You hold it in front of things and they look bigger.
* Narrator: The magnifying glass makes the little fish look big.
* Peppa Pig: Can I have a go?
* Peppa Pig: Wow!
* Narrator: The magnifying glass makes George’s eyes look very big.
* Daddy Pig: Now what you detectives need is a mystery to solve.
* Peppa Pig: Daddy, what’s a “mis-story”?
* Daddy Pig: A mystery is something detectives are good at sorting out. Like finding things that are lost.
* Peppa Pig: I know. We can find [[George Pig|George]]’s [[Mr. Dinosaur|toy dinosaur]]. That’s always getting lost.
* George: Dinosaur.
* Narrator: Mr Dinosaur is not lost.
* Peppa Pig: Oh. What about your glasses, Daddy? You’re always losing them
* Daddy Pig: (Chuckles) Not today. I’m wearing my glasses.
* Peppa Pig: It’s not fair. There aren’t any mis-stories.
* Daddy Pig: Would you like me to make you a mystery?
* Peppa Pig: Yes, please.
* Narrator: Daddy Pig is going to make a mystery.
* Daddy Pig: Now what’s on the table?
* Peppa Pig: [[Goldie|The little fish]], [[Teddy]], a jack-in-the-box, and Mr. Dinosaur.
* Daddy Pig: That’s right. Now look very hard and try to remember them all.
* Narrator: The little fish, Teddy, a jack-in-the-box, and Mr. Dinosaur.
* Daddy Pig: Have you remembered them?
* Peppa Pig: Yes.
* Daddy Pig: OK, you just have to go outside for a moment. I’ll call you when I’m ready.
* Peppa Pig: It sounds like daddy is going upstairs.
* Peppa Pig: And now he is coming down again.
* Daddy Pig: All right. You can come back inside now.
* Daddy Pig: One thing is missing from the table. Do you know what?
* Peppa Pig: Mr Dinosaur is there, little fish, jack-in-the-box.
* Daddy Pig: So who’s missing?
* Peppa Pig: Um, Teddy!
* Daddy Pig: That’s right. Teddy’s gone.
* Mummy Pig: Well done, Peppa and George.
* Peppa Pig: It was quite easy for us. We are famous detectives.
* Daddy Pig: Ah, but that’s only half the mystery. Where has Teddy gone?
* Peppa Pig: Oh, I don’t know.
* Daddy Pig: What are those little things on the floor?
* Peppa Pig: They’re cake crumbs.
* Narrator: The magnifying glass makes the cake crumbs easy to see.
* Daddy Pig: I wonder if Teddy has been eating cake.
* Peppa Pig: And the crumbs lead this way. Teddy’s been eating a lot of cake.
* Narrator: The crumbs lead into Peppa and George’s bedroom.
* Peppa Pig: Oh, the crumbs have stopped. How can we find Teddy?
* Daddy Pig: Ask me some questions. But I will only answer yes or no.
* Peppa Pig: OK. Um? Is Teddy in this room?
* Daddy Pig: Yes.
* Peppa Pig: Is Teddy in George’s bed?
* Daddy Pig: No.
* Peppa Pig: Is Teddy somewhere high up?
* Daddy Pig: Yes.
* Peppa Pig: Teddy’s in my bed!
* Daddy Pig and Mummy Pig: Hurrah!
* Narrator: The mystery is solved.
* Daddy Pig: Do you still want to be a detective when you grow up, Peppa?
* Peppa Pig: Being a detective is quite hard. Next time I want to be the one who makes the mysteries. Like you did, Daddy.
