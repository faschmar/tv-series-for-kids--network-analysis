Daddy Pig: Good. Now we can go into the water.

Peppa & George: Hooray!

Peppa: (Laughing).

(sobs)

Narrator: It is George's first time at a swimming pool.

Daddy Pig: Why don't you put just one foot into the water?

(cries)

Daddy Pig: Maybe you should try the other foot.

(cries again)

Mummy Pig: Maybe George should try both feet at the same time.

Daddy Pig: Good idea.

Daddy Pig: Well done, George. But you don't need to splash quite so much.

Narrator: Here is Rebecca Rabbit with her little brother, Richard Rabbit.

Peppa: Hello, Rebecca.

Rebecca: Hello, everyone.

Mummy Rabbit: Richard, hold onto this float and you can practice kicking your legs.

Mummy Pig: George, would you like to try kicking your legs?

Daddy Pig: Very good, but try not to splash.

Peppa: Big children don't splash. We're very good at swimming. When George and Richard are older, they'll be able to swim like us. Won't they, Rebecca?

Rebecca: Yes. (panting)

Peppa: Oh!

Narrator: Richard has a toy watering can.

Peppa: Stop it, Richard!

George & Richard: (Giggling)

George: Oh.

Narrator: Oh, dear. Richard has dropped his watering can into the pool.

(both crying)

Richard: Mummy!

Mummy Rabbit: Sorry, Richard, I can't reach. It's too far down.

George: Mummy!

Mummy Pig: I can't swim underwater.

Peppa: Even I can't swim underwater.

Daddy Pig: Hmm, please hold my glasses, Mummy Pig.

All: Hooray!

Daddy Pig: Here you go.

Mummy Pig: Well done, Daddy Pig.

Daddy Pig: I am rather good at swimming underwater.

Peppa: The watering can is for babies. Can we jump off the diving boards now?

Mummy Pig: Sorry, Peppa, diving boards are only for grown-ups.

Peppa & Rebecca: Oh!

Daddy Pig: Cheer up, you two. You can watch me dive.

Peppa: Silly Daddy, your tummy is too big.

Daddy Pig: Nonsense! I won trophies for my diving when I was younger.

Mummy Pig: That was quite a long time ago, Daddy Pig.

Daddy Pig: It's lucky I've kept myself so fit and strong. Please hold my glasses, Mummy pig. You'll get a better view if you watch me from the side.

Peppa: Please don't splash us with water, Daddy!

Daddy Pig: Of course I won't splash you, Peppa. I think I need a higher board.

Mummy Pig: Please be careful, Daddy Pig.

Peppa: Yes. Don't splash us, Daddy!

Daddy Pig: Don't worry, Peppa.

Peppa: Don't splash us with water, Daddy!

Daddy Pig: I told you I wouldnâ€™t splash.

Peppa: Clever Daddy.

Mummy Pig: Well done, Daddy Pig.

Daddy Pig: No need for my towel. I've got a special way of drying myself.

All: Eh! 

Narrator: Daddy Pig has splashed everyone with water.

Mummy Pig: Daddy Pig!

Daddy Pig: Sorry, everyone.

All: (Laughing).
