{{Super Episode Template}}Narrator: [[Mummy Pig]] has made a special box for [[Peppa Pig (character)|Peppa]].

Mummy Pig: Peppa, this box is just for you.

Peppa Pig: Thank you, Mummy.

Mummy Pig: It’s a secret box for you to keep secret things in.

Peppa Pig: What things can I put in it, Mummy?

Mummy Pig: Only you can decide that, Peppa. It’s your secret box.

Peppa Pig: I know what I can put in it.

Mummy Pig: Good, but don’t tell me.

Peppa Pig: I won’t tell you or [[George Pig/Gallery|George]] or [[Daddy Pig|Daddy]]. It’s a secret.

Peppa Pig: George, this is my secret box. It’s empty. I have to find some things to put inside.

Narrator: George wants to help Peppa.

Peppa Pig: No, George. Only I must know what’s in the box.

Peppa Pig: You have to wait outside while I choose.

Narrator: Peppa is going to choose some secret things to put in the box.

Peppa Pig: Now my secret box is full.

Peppa Pig: George, you must not look inside.

Narrator: George would like to know what is inside Peppa’s secret box.

Peppa Pig: If you like you can try to guess.

George: [[Mr. Dinosaur|Dinosaur]].

Narrator: George thinks Peppa has put a dinosaur in the box.

Peppa Pig: Oh, George, you always say dinosaur for everything.

Peppa Pig: Anyway, a dinosaur is too big to fit in the box.

Narrator: George cannot guess what is in Peppa’s secret box.

Narrator: Daddy Pig is cleaning a picture.

Peppa Pig: Daddy, this is my secret box. Mummy made it for me.

Daddy Pig: It’s very nice, Peppa. What’s inside?

Peppa Pig: It’s a secret. George tried to guess but he didn’t get it right.

Daddy Pig: Can I have a try?

Peppa Pig: Yes.

Daddy Pig: Hmm, have you put my glasses inside?

Peppa Pig: No. Your glasses are on your head.

Daddy Pig: So they are.

Peppa Pig: Silly Daddy. You must have a proper guess.

Daddy Pig: OK. Have you put Mummy’s shoes in the box?

Peppa Pig: Nope. And that’s all your guesses used up.

Narrator: Peppa likes secrets.

Peppa Pig: Mummy, no one knows what’s in my box.

Peppa Pig: Oh, what has George got?

Mummy Pig: I made a box for George too, and he’s filled it with secret things. And only George knows what’s inside.

Peppa Pig: Oh.

Narrator: Peppa would like to know what is inside George’s box.

Peppa Pig: It’s George’s toy dinosaur, of course.

George: No.

Narrator: George’s toy dinosaur is not in George’s box.

Peppa Pig: It’s too difficult! I’ll never guess.

Narrator: Peppa does not like secrets as much as she used to.

Mummy Pig: Maybe if you show George one thing from your box, then he could show you one thing from his.

Peppa Pig: OK. But we must do it at the same time.

Daddy Pig: That’s a good idea. On the count of three you each show what’s in your boxes. Ready?

Peppa Pig: Yes.

Daddy Pig: One, two, three!

Narrator: George has a drum.

Narrator: And Peppa has a trumpet.

Mummy Pig: Lovely!

Daddy Pig: Yes, it sounds very nice.

Daddy Pig: Do you have any more secret things?

Narrator: George has a custard doughnut.

Peppa Pig: Oh.

Narrator: Peppa’s box is empty.

Peppa Pig: I’ve got nothing else.

Mummy Pig: Luckily, I have. Come on, tuck in.

Narrator: George, Peppa, Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig all like custard doughnuts.

Daddy Pig: I don’t have a special box. But I know a very good place to hide my custard doughnut. Can you guess where?

Peppa Pig: Hmm, are you going to hide it in the fridge?

Daddy Pig: No, somewhere much more special. My tummy.

Daddy Pig: Mmm, delicious.

Peppa Pig: I’m going to hide mine in my tummy.

Mummy Pig: Me too.
