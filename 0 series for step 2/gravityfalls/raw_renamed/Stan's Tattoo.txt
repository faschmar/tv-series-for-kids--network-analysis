|''(Pretends to squish [[Dipper Pines|Dipper's]] head, making sloshing noises)''
|-
!Dipper
|Hello, I'm Dipper Pines. The girl trying to crush my head is Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Waves to the camera from behind it)'' I'm helping! 
|-
!Dipper
|Today on "''[[Shorts#Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained|Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained]]''—"
|-
!Mabel
|''("Squishes" his head again)''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, that—that's enough. Today we investigate Anomaly #23, [[Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan's]] secret tattoo. ''(Looks at bulletin board with pictures of Stan's tattoo)'' What is he hiding? A college prank? Secret symbol? Or something stranger? Stan claims it doesn't exist, but today we're gonna find out.
|-
!Mabel 
|Right after another exciting episode of... What's Under Mabel's Bandage? ''(Starts to peel Band-Aid off, singing)'' Doo doo...
|-
!Dipper
|Ew, Mabel!
|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, here's the plan. Stan never takes off his undershirt - ''(gets closer to the camera)'' obviously to hide his tattoo. ''(Goes back)'' But me and [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] are about to "turn up the heat" on this mystery. ''(Raises the temperature on the thermostat)''
|-
!Soos
|Ha ha! Literally! ''(Whispering)'' I love how you come up with stuff like that.
|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Walks up to Stan)'' Whoo, hot in here today, huh, Mr. Pines? Probably be a lot cooler if we... ''(Takes off his shirt)'' worked without our shirts on! Am I right?
|-
!Stan 
|Soos, I will ''pay'' you to put your shirt back on.
|-
!Soos
|Aw, don't be shy, Mr. Pines. ''(Grunts and lies on the table)'' Bodies are nothing to be ashamed of.
|-
!Stan
|Watch the shop for a minute, Soos. I need to go find a melon-baller and pull my eyeballs out. ''(Leaves)''
|-
!Soos
|
''(Plays with his stomach and sings) ''Doot, doot-doot-doot-doot, doot. Doot, doot-doot-doot-doot, hey! Dat, dat-dat-dat-dat...
|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, Plan B. ''(To Stan)'' Heavens! Is that poison oak on your shoulder? Let me scratch it for you. ''(Reaches for Stan's tattoo)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Smacks Dipper's hand away)'' Kid, if you're trying to see my tattoo, you're going to have to try harder than that.
|-
!Dipper
|A-ha! I thought you said you didn't have a tattoo!
|-
!Stan
|I don't, but you do. ''(Reaches for Dipper with a marker)''
|-
!Dipper
|What do you mean I— AAAH!
|-
!
|''Static, cuts to Dipper with the word "Goober" written on his forehead''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, Plan C. Stan is in the shower. I wish it hadn't come to this, but sometimes you have to do ''terrible'' things for science.
|-
!Mabel
|I believe in you, Goober!
|-
!Dipper
|Dipper. Just say Dipper. ''(Takes the camera, walks into the bathroom towards the running shower, unveils the curtain to reveal Stan fully dressed, water running down his face)''
|-
!Stan
|You're never gonna see it, kid. ''Never. Gonna. See it.''
|-
!Dipper
|How long have you been standing there?
|-
!Stan
|Give me that camera! ''(Reaches for camera)''
|-
!Dipper
|AH!
|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!Dipper
|So I just figured I'd just chill out on the roof for a while...
|-
!Stan
|''(Off-screen)'' I'M GONNA FIND YOU, KID!
|-
!
|''Crows fly from the woods.''
|-
!Dipper
|Well, that's it for this episode. Stan's tattoo remains a mystery, but who knows what other secrets are waiting to be uncovered.
|-
!
|''Static, cut to Soos poking his stomach and singing.''
|-
!Soos
|Doot, doot-doot-doot-doot, doot. Doot, doot-doot-doot-doot...
|-
!
|''Static. A part of the hidden page is shown.''
