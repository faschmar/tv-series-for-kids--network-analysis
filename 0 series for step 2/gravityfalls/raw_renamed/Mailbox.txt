|-
!Dipper
|...are gonna put a letter in and see who picks it up.
|-
!Soos
|My letter posits a salient question: "Sup Dawg?" ''(Puts letter in mailbox)''
|-

|-
!Dipper 
|Okay, okay. Here goes. ''(Opens the mailbox and pulls out a letter)'' What?!
|-
!Soos
|That's not our letter, dude!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Opens the letter)'' It says... ''(Gasps)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Grabs the letter and holds it up to the camera)'' "Hello Dipper and Soos."
|-
!Dipper
|It knows our names!
|-
!Soos
|What if this thing's all-knowing?
|-
!Dipper
|We gotta test it.

|''(Holding up a picture of a muscular woman)'' Whoa! Hot tamales! Save that one for the archives! ''(Puts it in his pocket)''
|-
!Dipper
|Uh... What is the exact time and date of my death?
|-
!Soos
|(''Shouting in the background'') Did aliens build the pyramids?!
|-
!Dipper
|Or... what is the meaning of life?
|-
!Soos
|(''Shouting in the background'') What are marshmallows made of?!
|-
!Dipper
|
Or... Who wrote [[Journal 3|Journal #3]]?!

|''(Comes up)'' Nifty! A mailbox! I've been wanting to mail [[Dipper and Mabel's parents|Mom]] this video of me sticking 100 gummy worms up my nose! ''(Puts a package inside)''
|-
!Dipper
|No, wait!
|-
!Soos
|Wait, dude!
|-
!Mabel
|Slam! ''(Slams mailbox door)''
|-
!
|''The flag raises.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Takes out letter)'' "Your gummy worm video has disturbed and insulted me. You fools are unworthy of my great knowledge. The era of human enlightenment shall never come to pass."
|-
!
|''The mailbox glows.''
|-
!Soos
|What's that?!
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Runs away)'' AAAHH!
|-
!
|''The mailbox collapses in on itself, then explodes in a flash of light. Static. Dipper, Mabel, and Soos are standing in the middle of a scorched clearing.''
|-
!Dipper
|Well, uh, that concludes ''Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained'', where we learned when dealing with the unknown, ''(angrily, to Mabel)'' do not mail videos of you shoving gummy worms up your nose!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Pulls out gummy worms)'' There's more where that came from! ''(Singing)'' Into my nose! Into my nose!
|-
!Dipper
|No! No! Show over! Show over! ''(Covers up camera)''
