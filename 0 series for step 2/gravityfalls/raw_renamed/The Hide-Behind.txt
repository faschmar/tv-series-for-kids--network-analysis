|''Static. Opens to [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] writing on sign.''

![[Mabel Pines|Mabel]]
|''(Whispering from behind camera)'' We're on!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh. ''(Clears throat)'' Hello. And welcome back to ''[[Shorts#Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained|Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained]]''.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Holds up UFO keychain and buzzes it)''
|-
!Dipper
|Thank you. Today we investigate Gravity Falls anomaly #132: The Hide Behind. ''(Holds up title card)''
|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Reading from [[Journal 3]])'' Local lumberjacks tell of a mysterious creature, always just out of sight. But these photos suggest it might actually be real! Either way, I intend to find out!
|-
!Mabel
|(''Jumps out at Dipper) ''Aah! I'm the Hide-Behind!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Drops camera)'' Aah! Mabel!
|-
!Mabel
|Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
|-
!
|''Static, cut to [[Manly Dan]].''
|-
!Dan
|Hide-Behind? Oh, he's real alright. REAL AS MY BEARD! Was behind me once; made this sound: "tch-tch-tch-tch". Mighty spooky.
|-
!
|''The tree that Dan's [[Marcus, Kevin and Gus|sons]] are cutting down starts to fall. They run away.''
|-
!Dan's Oldest Son
|Daaad!
|-
!Dan's Middle Son
|It's comin' down!
|-
!Dan 
|DADDY'S DOIN' A MOVIE! He's doin' a movie now.
|-

''The tree falls on a shack. Static, cut to [[Lazy Susan]] pouring and overflowing a cup of coffee.''
|-
![[Unnamed gray mustache man|Gray mustache man]]
|Could I get a refill, ma'am? Refill?
|-
!Susan
|Oh, the Hide-Behind is definitely real. Might even be behind me right now! Let me see... ''(turns around and around)'' Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa—! ''(Man is utterly confused)''
|-
!
|''Static, cut to [[Stan Pines|Stan]].''
|-
!Stan
|Don't believe every legend you hear, kid. The people in this town are literally the dumbest people in the world. Literally.
|-
!
|''Static, cut to Lazy Susan still spinning around. Cut back to Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|The Hide- Behind's just a rumor. You want a mystery? How about the mystery of why—
|-
!
|''Something runs behind Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|What the... AH!
|-
!Dipper
|That's it! ''(Runs after it)''
|-
!Stan
|Hey, we're doin' an interview here!
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper!
|-
!Stan
|Kid!
|-
!Dipper
|I'm coming for ya. Where is he? Where is he?
|-
!
|''Static, cut to a tiny tree.''
|-
!Dipper
|Alright. After hours of searching, I've narrowed it down to this tree. ''(the camera faces Dipper)'' I know what you're wondering. How do you catch a creature who's always right behind you? How about... ''(steps away from the camera)'' A mirror suit! Nothing's going to sneak up on old Dipper— ''(Suddenly gets poked in the head with a stick)'' AAH!
|-
!Mabel 
|''(Hangs down from a tree)'' Blind spot!
|-
!Dipper
|AAH! ''(Falls over)'' Oof! I'm down! Dipper down!
|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!Dipper
| This is it. Get ready to finally be seen, Hide-Behind! In 3... 2... 1...
|-
!
|''Jumps behind the tree to find an owl with a maraca in its mouth.''
|-
!Dipper
|A-ha! What?
|-
!Mabel
|Wow! Cool! Maraca owl!
|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Takes off mirror suit and dumps it on the ground, groans)'' Well, based on the lack of evidence, I have to conclude, anomaly #132, the Hide-Behind, just a legend. ''(Sighs and starts to walk away)''
|-
!Hide Behind
|''(Follows him, then hides behind a tree when Dipper turns around)''
|-
!Dipper
|What was that? Eh, nothing. ''(Keeps walking)''
|-
!
|''The Hide Behind continues to follow Dipper, then hides when he turns again. Dipper walks off, followed by the Hide Behind. Static. A part of the hidden page is shown.''
