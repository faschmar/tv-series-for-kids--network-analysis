|''Opens to [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] holding a basket of chicken strips.''
|-
!Dipper
|Well, that concludes Gravity Falls anomaly #13, the Möbius chicken strip. ''(Eats chicken strip)'' It's infinitely delicious!

!Dipper

|-
!Mabel
|Never. ''(Faces the other direction)'' Let me sleep forever.
|-
!Dipper
|Some creature just jumped out of nowhere! It's eating our leftover [[Summerween (event)|Summerween]] candy!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gets up)'' What?!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Points camera at the monster)'' Look!
|-
!Mabel
|Ew, it's like a... naked little man.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Holds up title card)'' Okay, this is now Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained, # 76, uh, "That Thing?"
|-
!The Thing
|''(Eats candy) (Picks up candy basket)''
|-
!Mabel
|No, put it down. Put it down...

|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Comes into view dressed in squeaky toys)'' Okay, I'm ready. I've covered myself in armor. ''(Squeaks toy with golf club)'' I'm going to capture him for science.
|-
!Mabel
|And for candy!
|-
!Dipper
|Get this on tape in case I die or whatever. ''(Walks over to the Thing and moves some candy with the golf club, then tries to catch it in a wastebasket)'' Aha!
|-
!The Thing
|''(Climbs up the ceiling)''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh! Die mutant! Die! ''(Throws squeaky toy at it, but it comes back and hits her)'' Ow!
|-
!The Thing
|''(Jumps into the staircase)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Runs after it)''
|-
!Mabel
|Save the candy!
|-
!Dipper
|Where is it? Have you seen it? ''(Gets attacked by the monster)''
|-
!The Thing
|''(Jumps down on Dipper and knocks him over, grabs candy and runs off)''
|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!
|''(The Thing is on the fridge. It throws the cereal onto the floor)''
|-
!Mabel
|Oh no!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Throws a can at the Thing)''
|-
!The Thing
|''(Throws candy at Dipper)''
|-
!Mabel
|He's wasting candy! Dipper, open your mouth! Try to catch the candy in your mouth!
|-
!Dipper
|What? No, why would I— ''(Catches candy in mouth and munches)'' Actually that's pretty good— ''(Gets hit by a big candy bar)'' Aah!
|-
!The Thing
|''(Runs with candy into the living room and turns on the TV with his foot, then stares at it)''
|-
!Mabel
|Look! He's hypnotized by the TV.
|-
!Dipper
|Ha! And he dropped the candy! What a little dummy! Glued to the... to the... Oh, I love this movie.
|-

|''Static.''
|-
!
|''(Dipper, Mabel, and the Thing are watching TV; Dipper and Mabel are eating candy while the Thing eats a golf club)''
|-
!Dipper
|Shouldn't we... ''(munches)'' do something about the monster?
|-
!Mabel
|Candy now. Monster later.
|-
!The Thing
|''(Eats the golf club and whimpers, Dipper gets another one for it and eats it)''
|-
![[Soos Ramirez|Soos]]
|Oh, hey Dipper! Hey Mabel! ''(Pauses, then looks at the Thing)'' Hey [[Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan]]!
|-
!Dipper
|''(To the audience)'' Well, that's it for Dipper's Guide to the Supernatural. The next episode will probably be about getting rid of this candy-eating monster.
|-
!Soos
|''(To the Thing)'' Psst! Stan, what's he talking about?
