|-
!
|''Cuts to Mabel with a projector.''
|-
!Mabel
|Ah, color. It's all around us! ''(Turns to a picture of Dipper)'' From the green of a nauseous twin brother, ''(Turns to a picture of [[Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan]])'' to the weird orange of an old man's nose, ''(Turns to a picture of a toilet next to [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]])'' to the beautiful sky blue of toilet water. 
|-
!Soos
|(points towards projector) I'm in that one!
|-
!Mabel
|Yes you are, Soos. ''(To the camera)'' But it wasn't always this way''. (Turns to a black and white picture)'' According to history, the world was black and white until color was invented ''(A wizard Mabel drew appears in the picture)'' by a magic wizard named "Crayondalf the Fabulous!" What's your favorite color, Gravity Falls?
|-
!
|''Cuts to a montage asking the people of Gravity Falls what their favorite color is.''

|-
![[Grenda]]
|Beige!
|-
![[Dipper Pines|Dipper]]
|Wendy. Wait, what was the question again?
|-
!Soos
|Lasers. Ooh! Or liquid metal! Does leopards count as a color?
|-
![[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]]
|Flannel.
|-
!Soos
|Okay, okay. I've narrowed it down to Aurora Borealis, camouflage...
|-
![[Candy Chiu|Candy]]
|Magic vision poster!
|-
![[Gompers]]
|''(Captioned):'' Burgundy.
|-
!Stan
|None.
|-
!Mabel
|What?
|-
!Stan
|I don't have a favorite color. I don't even like colors. 
|-
!Mabel
|Not even ''rainbows''?
|-
!Stan
|Beats me. I've never seen a rainbow.
|-
!Mabel
|WHAT?!?
|-
!
|''Cuts to Mabel with horns, a siren, and a sign written "COLOR EMERGENCY." Then cuts to Mabel with Dipper, Candy, Grenda and [[Waddles]].''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright guys, how can we get Grunkle Stan to see a rainbow? I need ideas, people!
|-
!Waddles
|''(Walks away)''
|-
!Grenda
|Sometimes if I drink expired milk, I see rainbows! I'm gonna try right now! ''(Takes out a gallon of expired milk and starts to drink it)''
|-
!Candy
|''(Takes out a paper, starts drawing on it and shows it to the camera)'' What if we reflect the rainbow from the falls into Stan's window?
|-
!Dipper and Candy
|Yeah! ''(High fives)''
|-
!Grenda
|Yeah! ''(Falls off the bed and starts to sleep)''
|-
!Candy
|It's fine. She does this.
|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!Mabel
|Alright, we're about to unleash the power of the "Roy-G-Biv-A-Tron" into Stan's office!
|-
!
|''Cuts to Dipper and Candy at the end of the waterfall. They reflect the rainbow with a mirror. Cuts back to Stan.''
|-
!Stan
|Nothing brightens the dark room like a light from a window! Time to open the window... ''(Stan opens the window and the rainbow beams right into his eyes)'' OH NO!! WHY!!! WHY IS THIS HAPPENING!!
|-
!Mabel
|Ta-daah! Surprise!
|-
!Stan
|MY EYES ARE ON FIRE! AAAAAAHH! AAAAAAAHH! AAAAAAHHH! ''(Stan falls down)''
|-
!Mabel
|Maybe we over did it a little bit.
|-
!Stan
|AAAAAAHH! AAAAAAAHH! OH ITS SO HOT IT HURTS! AAAAAAHH!
|-
!
|''Stan's desk starts to burn. Static. Cuts to Stan getting his eyes bandaged by Soos and Dipper in the background while Mabel is in front of the camera.''
|-
!Stan
|Get those bandages good and tight! I'm not giving my life savings to some quack doctor.
|-
!Mabel
|That's it for today! Join us next week when we'll be doing "Mabel's Guide to Apologizing to your Great Uncle."
|-
!Stan
|I hate color more than ever!
|-
!Mabel
|He's just saying that. ''(Whispering)'' Cut! Cut it!
