|''The episode starts with someone knocking on the door of the [[Mystery Shack]].''
|-
![[Stan Pines]]
|''(Opens the door with a big smile)'' Welcome to the Mystery Shack, gentlemen! What can I get you? ''(Takes a snow globe and an U.F.O key chain out of his jacket)'' Key chains? Snow globes? These rare photos of American presidents? ''(Pulls a five dollar bill out of his sleeve as he begins to sweat)''
|-
!Narrator
|This is [[Gravity Falls (TV series)|Gravity Falls]]!
|-
!
|''[[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] and [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] crash through the 'Welcome to Gravity Falls" sign with the [[Mystery Cart]], screaming.''
|-
![[Dippy Fresh]]
|Flip-a-dip-dip! ''(Poses)''
|-
!
|''A massive blue light glows from the inside of the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Voice-Over:)'' [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]] has this secret dark side.
|-
!
|''Cut to the Stuffed Animal Tree turning into Bill's eyes; Mabel possessed by [[Ghosts]]; the [[Cooler monster]]; the [[Manotaurs]] holding Dipper's eyes open; the [[Shape Shifter]] as a mixture of Dipper, Mabel and a bug-creature, Dippy Fresh skateboarding and Mabel smacking Dipper.''
|-
!Mabel
|Shut up!
|-
!Narrator
|''(Cut to a map of Oregon, which zooms in on Gravity Falls; Dipper and Mabel dodging tranquilizer darts; Dipper, Mabel and [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] running away from a pinball and Dipper and Mabel driving in a golf cart)'' A small town in Oregon, where preteen twins, Dipper and Mabel Pines... Wait, wait, wait, wait, [[Time Baby]]? What are you doing here? ''(Cut to Time Baby over a crowd of spectators)'' NOOO!
|-
!Time Baby
|Move out of the way; you're ridiculous. They already know all of this! Don't you? You know about the codes, the ciphers and the clues.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel, Soos and [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]] descending into the bunker; the three Journals laid out on Stan's desk, the tapestry of [[Bill Cipher]] in the [[Northwest Manor]]; Bill Cipher flashing images; the Stan Pines Dead article; the UFO keychain in front of the floating cliffs; the carving of the upside down angel in the [[Gravity Falls Museum of History]] and Mabel in front of the [[Bottomless pit (place)|Bottomless pit]].''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Giggles)'' It's just my personal box of mysterious secrets. ''(Grunts and pushes the box into the pit)'' Goodbye forever!
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Clay monsters|Cyclops]] roaring and Stan in his car with Soos.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Gets out)'' Well, this is getting weird.
|-
!Time Baby
|Did you think ''that's'' the mystery behind Gravity Falls?
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel in the attic; Bill throwing the [[Interdimensional rift]] at the ground and to [[Gideon Gleeful]].''
|-
!Gideon
|This town has secrets you couldn't begin to comprehend.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Leaderaur]] eating an old Manotaur; Mabel punching a [[gnomes|gnome]] that is on Dipper's face and Stan's face melting off.''
|-
!Time Baby
|That makes me laugh! And drool a little bit. And maybe I need a new diaper. The point is: there is so much more to Gravity Falls than you ever imagined.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Rumble McSkirmish]] yelling; Stan in the basement; Stan looking out from behind the vending machine and to Dipper in front of [[Ford Pines]].''
|-
!Dipper
|So, uh, would you mind if I asked you a couple billion questions about Gravity Falls?
|-
!Ford
|Uh...
|-
!
|''Cut to [[.GIFfany]] talking to Soos; Gideon shining the magic flashlight at a mirror showing Stan and the Time Baby destroying some wreckage.''
|-
!Time Baby
|And how do I know? Well, because I'm a MULTIDIMENSIONAL OVERLORD! ''(In clip:)'' OHOHOHOHO.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan getting past the government agents while in zero gravity; [[Jason Ritter]] and [[Linda Cardellini]] dressed as Dipper and Wendy in the weirdness bubble and to [[Alex Hirsch]].''
|-
!Time Baby
|''(Voice Over:)'' But I also have access to the other side. I have Alex Hirsch, the creator, trapped in a room! And I will force him to share the INNER WORKINGS of his mind!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel sleeping and to Ford, in 1982, at the door of the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Ford
|Have you come to ''steal my eyes?! (Aims crossbow)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper.''
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know what to say I have so many questions I- ohhh I think I'm gonna throw up!
|-
!
|''Cut to a gnome vomiting; Dipper, Mabel, Soos and Wendy in the bunker; Dipper attempting to punch Bill and a Journal turning its pages.''
|-
!Time Baby
|Ahahahaha!
|-
!Alex Hirsch
|I'm never gonna reveal these secrets, guys, you can't make me.
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Gravity Falls Main Title Theme]].''
|-
!Alex Hirsch
|Uh, Time Baby... if you're ever being... if Time Baby's ever tryin' to fight you...
|-
!Time Baby
|SILENCE!
|-
!Hirsch
|Just leave the room. He doesn't have object permanence. He'll think you're not there anymore.
|-
!Time Baby
|Quit stalling, Alex! This show isn't about me! Reveal your secrets!
|-
!Hirsch
|Time Baby is a big dumb baby.
|-
!Time Baby
|I am not!
|-
!Hirsch
|What are you gonna do, Time Baby? Huh, you gonna zap me?
|-
!Time Baby
|Enough! (''Rewinds'')
|-
!Hirsch
|I'd say if you're rewatching the series all over again, pay particular attention to the backgrounds.
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos.''
|-
!Soos
|Maybe there's nothing creepy goin' on in this room.
|-
!Hirsch
|In [[Gideon Rises]], we see a flashback of the hand of the unknown author writing the journals.
|-
!
|''Cut to the author putting a "2" on the cover of a journal.''
|-
!Hirsch
|We see a skull, we see a polished desk, but we also see a bit of a rainbow reflection.
|-
!
|''Cut to the Soos sweeping up Ford's former room.''
|-
!Hirsch
|A really keen-eyed fan might notice that inside the secret room in [[Carpet Diem]], there is a triangular glass prism that's casting a rainbow reflection. It's a subtle way to let you know that that room belonged to the author. I don't think anyone's actually figured that one out yet.
|-
!Soos
|This little shack is full of weird secrets!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper going over his plan with [[Dipper clones|his clones]] and Dipper playing [[Robbie Valentino]]'s record backwards.''
|-
!Hirsch
|Dipper is based on my memory of how is felt to be a kid.
|-
!Stan
|''(Spit-takes)'' Holy mackeral!
|-
!Hirsch
|When I was around Dipper's age I would record myself and play it backwards. I tried to learn to speak backwards.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper playing [[Dipper's Voice Remix]].''
|-
!Remix
|D-D-D-D-D-D-Dipper Pines.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper with Robbie's record.''
|-
!Dipper
|I knew it! It's mind control after all!
|-
!Hirsch
|I didn't have a lot of friends.
|-
!Time Baby
|Time Baby is not surprised.
|-
!Hirsch
|Time Baby doesn't know as much as he thinks he knows.
|-
!Time Baby
|I know all there is to know!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper looking at his reflection.''
|-
!Hirsch
|When I was in middle school, I was in a class with a kid who had, no fault of his own, some really unusual acne; every day was a little different.
|-
!
|''Cut to Wendy and Dipper in the Mystery Shack hallway.''
|-
!Wendy
|Show me! Show me!
|-
!Hirsch
|So I would sort of chart the constellations from my sketchbook and I remember one day he has a perfect Big Dipper, the exact dots right on his forehead.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper showing Wendy his birthmark.''
|-
!Wendy
|That's how you got your nickname! I thought your parents just hated you or something.
|-
!Time Baby
|Reveal his first name!
|-
!Hirsch
|I can't say it.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Candy Chiu]].''
|-
!Candy
|It begins with a "D" and ends with an "ipper."
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper introducing himself to a girl.''
|-
!Dipper
|My name is Dopper.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Quentin Trembley]] addressing Dipper.''
|-
!Trembley
|And Roderick-
|-
!Dipper
|Uh, actually-
|-
!Trembley
|You, dear boy...
|-
!Time Baby
|Confirm!
|-
!Hirsch
|Uh, no.
|-
!Time Baby
|NOW!
|-
!Hirsch
|I think Time Baby needs a nap.
|-
!Time Baby
|Your face needs a nap!
|-
!Hirsch
|Dipper and Mabel's first names have a similarity, but I will not tell you what that similarity is.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel in front of the statue of [[Nathaniel Northwest]].''
|-
!Dipper
|Mystery twins?
|-
!Mabel
|I thought you hated that.
|-
!Dipper
|I'm startin' to accept it.
|-
!Time Baby
|Uh, fine, let's move on to Mabel.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel putting earrings on.''
|-
!Mabel
|Beep bop!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel with a karaoke book.''
|-
!Mabel
|Boop!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel poking Dipper with a stick; neighing at the knight pieces from a chess game; squeezing her face; blowing a raspberry and standing behind Dipper.''
|-
!Time Baby
|She is a simple creature with nothing to hide.
|-
!Mabel
|Quack quack quaaacckk!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel eating [[Smile Dip]] and groaning.''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel?
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel bouncing on her bed; knitting a sweater in front of the TV; putting a sweater on Waddles and tackling Soos.''
|-
!Hirsch
|Every time she's not on camera in an episode she's off knitting the next week's [[List of Mabel's sweaters|sweaters]].
|-
!Mabel
|''(Sitting on Soos and punching him excitedly)'' AAAH! HA HA HA SOOS!
|-
!Hirsch
|Mabel is inspired by my twin sister, specifically the way she acted in elementary school.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel watching a TV showing [[Ariel Hirsch]] on a home video and to Mabel in second grade with slap bracelets on.''
|-
!Mabel
|Boom! A million slap bracelets!
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos measuring Dipper and Mabel's heights.''
|-
!Hirsch
|In I think sixth grade, it finally happened where, like, my sister grew taller than me.
|-
!Soos
|She's got exactly one millimeter on you
|-
!Hirsch
|The next year, I just, like, doubled in height.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel, Dipper and Soos in the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Mabel
|Alpha twin! Alpha twin!
|-
!Hirsch
|I am the alpha twin now, if you ask me.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel, Stan and Soos at the [[Gravity Falls Pool]].''
|-
!Mabel
|Ah, the pool! Sparkling oasis of summer enchantment.
|-
!Stan
|Yeah, nothing like sitting in a moist tub with strangers. It's like the bus, but wet.
|-
!Hirsch
|Grunkle Stan is based on my grandpa, Stan.
|-
!Time Baby
|Stan certainly has secrets.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel viewing Stan's memory of him playing with his stomach.''
|-
!Mabel
|Sweet Sally!
|-
!Time Baby
|Share them.
|-
!
|''Cut to Robbie leaving the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Robbie
|Catch you on the rewind.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel and Stan watching fireworks; Dipper, Mabel and Stan counterfeiting; them at the table and riding in the car.''
|-
!Hirsch
|If you're rewatching the series, watch closely how Stan talks about family.
|-
!Stan
|Today we're gonna have some ''real'' family fun. Now, who wants to put on some blindfolds and ''get into my car''?
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|Yay!
|-
!Hirsch
|Thinks about family.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan hugging Mabel in Dipper's body.''
|-
!Stan
|Shh. You had me at "shut up, old man."
|-
!Hirsch
|And it will make a lot more sense; you'll notice that some of the puzzle pieces have fit together.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan and the twins in the gift shop.''
|-
!Stan
|Don't worry about what's in the basement. You belong up here with me and Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|Yeah!
|-
!Hirsch
|Now that we know Grunkle Stan has a twin brother, when you watch an episode like [[Headhunters]]...
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan with his wax statue.''
|-
!Stan
|You need anything? Ha ha. I love this guy! Don't you go nowhere!
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan crying at Wax Stan's funeral.''
|-
!Hirsch
|You see how distraught he is that wax double of him gets destroyed. You might understand the psychology there a little but better.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel brushing their teeth.''
|-
!Stan
|NOOOOO! Wax Stan! He's been m-m-murdered!
|-
!Time Baby
|Interesting, but we must continue forward!
|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Mystery Fair]] being rewound and to Dipper and Mabel.''
|-
!Mabel
|Don't you wanna learn some Soos secrets?
|-
!Hirsch
|Soos is definitely one of my favorite characters to voice.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel, Stan, Soos, Candy and Grenda watching TV and eating candy.''
|-
!Soos
|I ate a man alive tonight.
|-
!Hirsch
|One of our writers, [[Jeff Rowe|Jeff]], he kind of speaks in weird, made-up hip-hop terms.
|-
!
|''Cut to the unveiling of Wax Stan. Soos presses the [[Beeblyboop]].''
|-
!Beeblyboop
|Yeayah! Ye-ye-ye-ye-yeayah!
|-
!Hirsch
|And Soos starts saying those kinds of things.
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos being a DJ at the Mystery Shack party and to Dipper and Soos with [[Dippy Fresh]].''
|-
!Dipper
|YOU STAY OUT OF THIS, DIPPY FRESH!
|-
!Soos
|Dippy Fresh didn't do anything to you, dawg.
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos dislodging Mabel's braces from the screen door.''
|-
!Soos
|Say "aw," girl dude.
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos on the [[S.S. Cool Dude]] talking to Dipper and Mabel.''
|-
!Soos
|Wassup, Hambone? ''(fistbumps Mabel and makes explosion noises)''
|-
!Time Baby
|Explain where this "Soos" came from.
|-
!Hirsch
|Soos was inspired by someone I went to college with, this guy, Jesús Chambrot.
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos on his couch.''
|-
!Soos
|I'm great at fixing stuff, playing video games, having a sort of mustache.
|-
!Hirsch
|He was kind of a mystery, but he was always in the computer lab and he always wanted to help you.
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos in a black robe.''
|-
!Soos
|Handyman of the apocalypse, at your service.
|-
!Hirsch
|He would see you, and he would be like ''(Soos voice:)'' "Hey, dude, hey, dude, you need help with the printer?" ''(Normal voice:)'' You'd be like "No, I'm good," he's be like ''(Soos voice:)'' "No, I'm gonna help you fix the printer."
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos taking the back off of an arcade game.''
|-
!Soos
|I should have thought of this years ago!
|-
!Hirsch
|"Oh, whoops, I broke the printer. You want some help fixing the printer that I just broke?"
|-
![[Unnamed red cap man]]
|Ah!
|-
!Soos
|''(Inside the arcade machine)'' Help, I'm trapped in the game!
|-
!Hirsch
|He was always causing and solving problems.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel on the S.S Cool Dude.''
|-
!Dipper
|Don't lose your cameras.
|-
!Soos
|Wait, lose the cameras?
|-
!Dipper
|''Don't!''
|-
!Soos
|Dude, I just threw two away.
|-
!Hirsch
|But it always came from the most sincere place.
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos in the attic.''
|-
!Soos
|My wisdom is both a blessing and a curse.
|-
!
|''Cut to Wendy on lifeguard duty.''
|-
!Wendy
|I make the rules, sucker! ''(Throws a water balloon at Stan)''
|-
!Hirsch
|Every poured the coolest person they knew into a pot and Wendy was born.
|-
!
|''Cut to Wendy hitting the lever to the bunker with her ax.''
|-
!Wendy
|Boosh.
|-
!
|''Cut to Wendy, Dipper and Mabel on the roof.''
|-
!Dipper
|Did you put all the stuff up here?
|-
!Wendy
|I may or may not sneak up here from work, all the time, every day.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Wendy watching [[Nearly Almost Dead But Not Quite!]]; Wendy using a piece of metal to shield herself from the [[Shape Shifter]]'s tongue; running away with Gideon and Wendy and Dipper in a car.''
|-
!Dipper
|Wendy, you're the coolest person I know.
|-
!Wendy
|I know, dude. Tell me about it later.
|-
!Time Baby
|Alex, what about the other characters? Commencing lightning round! You have sixty seconds. ''(Timer begins from one minute)''
|-
!Hirsch
|[[Lazy Susan]]: she used to have two functioning eyes until a science experiment zapped one of them.
|-
!
|''Cut to Lazy Susan being zapped by one of Ford's machines.''
|-
!Lazy Susan
|Ah! My eye!
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Sheriff Blubs]] and [[Deputy Durland]] spitting coffee at each other.''
|-
!Hirsch
|I don't think the guy I named Deputy Durland after knows there's a cartoon show with his name in it; hopefully he never finds out. Sorry, Durland, if you ever discover this.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Toby Determined]] in filthy clothes in an alley and at the grand unveiling of Wax Stan.''
|-
!Hirsch
|Toby Determined is days away from giving up on everything.
|-
!Stan
|Your microphone's a turkey baster, Toby.
|-
!Toby
|It certainly i-
|-
!Stan
|Next question.
|-
!Hirsch
|Time Baby is easily distracted by dangling keys. Little weakness.
|-
!Time Baby
|No, I'm not.
|-
!
|''Cut to various shots of [[Preston Northwest|Preston]] and [[Priscilla Northwest]].''
|-
!Hirsch
|Preston owns a mudflap factory and his wife was Miss Mudlflap 85 or whatever and he just decided "Oh, she is gorgeous."
|-
!Preston
|Tonight, we will enjoy only the finest tastes and only the snootiest of laughter.
|-
!Man
|Oh ho, oh huh, uh huh huh huh.
|-
!
|''The Northwest servants applaud.''
|-
!Preston
|That's the ticket.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Pacifica Northwest]] with her parents at [[Ye Royal Discount Putt Hutt]].''
|-
!Hirsch
|So, Pacifica is secretly of mudflap blood.
|-
!
|''Cut to Pacifica at the door of the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Pacifica
|I need your help.
|-
!Dipper
|You're the worst. ''(Slams door)''
|-
!Time Baby
|Lightning round complete!
|-
!Hirsch
|Gideon: Gideon's a villain.
|-
!
|''Cut to Gideon walking by [[Mrs. Gleeful]].''
|-
!Gideon
|Mother.
|-
!Hirsch
|There was a lot of brainstorming about what he might be like in particular, what his design was and what was going on with his hair.
|-
!
|''Cut to Gideon on stage at one of his performances; standing in front of the [[Gideon-bot]] being constructed; clapping as doves fly out of his hair and on the Mystery Shack porch with a [[Gummy Koalas|gummy koala]] in his hair.''
|-
!Gideon
|One of those infernal gummy koalas has gotten into my perfect hair!
|-
!
|''Cut to Gideon standing in front of a model of Gideonland; in front of journals 1 and 3 and walking away from Dipper and Mabel in his room.''
|-
!Hirsch
|We gave him big hair with the thought that maybe there may be a malformed second twin that Gideon hid with his hair that maybe Gideon had a twin as well.
|-
!
|''Cut to Deputy Durland pushing Gideon into the police car.''
|-
!Gideon
|NO! Watch the hair!
|-
!Hirsch
|I don't think there is anymore. ''(Laughs)''
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Bill Cipher]] in front of Gideon; as a multilevel black pyramid and to Bill's entry in Journal 3.''
|-
!Bill Cipher
|Reality is an allusion the universe is a hologram buy gold BYEE!
|-
!Time Baby
|He is a danger to our universe! His name must NOT be mentioned, Alex!
|-
!Hirsch
|Bill...
|-
!Time Baby
|Seriously?
|-
!Hirsch
|When we came up with him was one hundred percent inspired by the idea: what if I took the triangle from the back of the dollar bill, dressed him up with a top hat and stupid little arms and legs and named him Bill, after the dollar.
|-
!
|''Cut to the triangle from the back of the dollar bill with an outline of Bill drawn around and to Bill in front of the statue of Nathaniel Northwest.''
|-
!Bill
|But you can call me your new lord and master for all of eternity! ''(Burns the statue with a laser from his eye)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Bill getting angry at Mabel and Soos and to him building the [[Fearamid]].''
|-
!Hirsch
|He actually was originally going to be green, but an artist said, "No, he looks kinda weird; he looks like a leaf." So we made him yellow...
|-
!Time Baby
|And now he looks like a nacho. Huhuhuhhahaha!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper as a ghost flying through the floors of the Mystery Shack where the government's recorder is circled; a frame of [[The Legend of the Gobblewonker]] which is zoomed into Stan's license plate; Stan sleeping with [[The Plot Twist]] highlighted; Dipper and Mabel standing outside of the kitchen and the camera zooming in on Mabel's sweater; a shadow falling over the floating cliffs and the Mystery Shack; the Gideon-bot jumping down at Dipper and Mabel; Gideon looking at the town with Journals 1 and 2 and to Gideon's robot carrying Mabel.''
|-
!Hirsch
|There's a lot of things like that where a simple design actually has a greater significance. In the episode, "[[Dreamscaperers]]", Mabel is wearing a sunset sweater; that is meant to symbolize the descent from our storytelling from a brighter story to a darker story. And we set up the two-parter with Gideon's takeover of the town.
|-
!Gideon
|Once I find the final journal I'll rule this town, with you as my queen. Ahahaha!
|-
!
|''Cut to Bill entering Stan's mind; Dipper, Mabel and Soos entering Stan's mind; Mabel popping the [[Prison Bubble]] and to Bill appearing to Gideon.''
|-
!Hirsch
|In the original plot for "Dreamscaperers," we imagined that Bill was going to enter ''all'' the characters' dreams and we were going to see inside Soos' mind and we were going to see inside Mabel's mind. We simplified the story to [[Stan's mindscape|Stan's mind]], but a lot of the ideas for Mabeland came from that alternate idea. Also in the episode we introduced Bill for the first time.
|-
!Bill
|Oh, Gravity Falls, it is good to be back, and I take you're some kind of living ventriloquist dummy?
|-
!Hirsch
|Bill's a real bad guy.
|-
!
|''Cut to Bill rearranging the orifices on [[Preston Northwest]]'s face and to [[Tad Strange]].''
|-
!Tad
|Oh, snap.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[The Duchess Approves]]' opening credits.''
|-
!Hirsch
|We now return to "The Duchess Approves," starring Sturley Stemblebergiss as "The Duchess," and Grampton St. Rumperfrabble as irascible coxswain Saunterblugget Hampterfuppinshire.
|-
!Hirsch and Time Baby
|''(Say nothing for several seconds)''
|-
!Time Baby
|Forget it. I'm using a [[Time wish]]. ''(Fast forwards through time)''
|-
!Hirsch
|Uh, I always thought that, if I was to make a TV show, how great would it be if I made it full of all those crazy backwards messages and secret codes and puzzles that, if there was any kid out there as weird as me, they would actually find the thing they were looking for. Fans are a million times smarter than I am. ''(Laughs)'' I have learned that the hard way. And so in [[Season 2]], we said, yes, let's up the ante, let's have a code that's harder to crack.
|-
!
|''Cut to some statues of people's heads in the [[Summerween Superstore]] that are circled with the caption "Storyboard artists and writers"; a tree outside of the Corduroy house with "R + W" carved into it; Stan driving past a sign that says "NOW LEAVING NEW JERSEY" with a pine tree outline next to it; the [[Northwest Cover-up]] document with the phrase "evil, time-devouring baby" highlighted; Stan reading a newspaper with the headline "UFO WAS A SHAM!"; the Northwest Manor and to Bill, while in Dipper's body, looking in the mirror.''
|-
!Bill
|''(Slaps himself)'' WHOO! ''(Slaps himself)'' WHOO! Haha!
|-
!
|''The camera zooms into the word "CIPHER" in the mirror and to two [[Blind Eye Society]] members walking down the hall.''
|-
!Hirsch
|Let's have a code ''word'' that is ''hidden''.
|-
!Man
|Probably just the janitor kissing that wax settler woman again.
|-
!Man 2
|Whoo! Remind me to erase ''that'' from my memory.
|-
!
|''The word "ERASE," seen on a skeleton's spine, is highlighted; cut to screens all over the [[Future city]] showing Dipper and Mabel laughing and hitting each other with plastic baseball bats; camera zooms in to the word "CAPACITOR" on one of the screens. ''
|-
!Lolph
|So be it.
|-
!
|''Cut to the underground bunker with the word "SHIFTER," highlighted on a barrel; Dipper and Mabel crowdsurfing and to the [[Love God]] chasing Dipper and Mabel, with the letters of the keyword placed into a box as they run by them.''
|-
!Hirsch
|Probably the best hidden one we ever had was in the episode, "[[The Love God]]." Dipper and Mabel are running through a crowded festival and the letters are spaced out in the background. They're so spread out, I didn't think anyone would be able to find 'em. Sure enough, ten minutes after the episode aired, somebody had cracked it.
|-
!Time Baby
|It only took ''me'' fifteen seconds.
|-
!
|''Cut to the end pages of every episode except the last and then to the end pages arranged into a picture with two pages missing.''
|-
!Hirsch
|The other thing we did this season that we didn't do in [[Season 1]] is, at the very end of the episode there's a flash, and you see a single frame of one larger puzzle, and that was all leading up to the big reveal of Stan's twin brother.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Grenda, Mabel, Soos and Stan watching [[Duck-tective]].''
|-
!Mabel
|''That's'' the big twist we were waiting for?
|-
!Grenda
|What a rip-off!
|-
!Soos
|I predicted that, like, a year ago.
|-
!Hirsch
|There's a lot of things in the show that, you can't help it, they just slip in.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan in the underground lab.''

!Stan
|''(Puts on a six-fingered glove)'' I've come this far. Who could possibly catch me now? ''(Pulls the lever; puts his hands up excitedly and yelps as a pipe flies by and hits him; wraps his hand in a bandage)''
|-
!Hirsch
|In, uh, [[Society of the Blind Eye]], Stan is working on the portal and a piece of debris bangs his hand and we see him bandaging his hand up. And then in the next few episodes, he still has that bandage on his hand.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan looking at a journal page; talking to Soos; watching the [[Stan balloon]] rise; marking his fingerprints for the government and to him in the yard.''
|-
!Stan
|Folk music! It's the [[Woodstick]] festival!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel rising out of their beds as gravity stops; the portal glowing while Dipper, Mabel, Soos and Stan lift off the ground; outside as gravity stops; [[Wax figures|Wax Sherlock Holmes]] trying to stab Dipper and causing the "S" in the Mystery Shack's sign to fall; a shot of the Mystery Shack with no "S" in "SHACK" and to Dipper in the attic with the [[Height-altering crystals|crystal flashlight]].''
|-
!Hirsch
|It took a while before we got to the big answer about what the portal was. Stan's bandage on his hand was a way to show: don't worry, it's still happening, we haven't forgotten these stories are connected. There's a lot of things like that, where something will change and stay changed for the rest of the series.
|-
!Dipper
|Bigger! ''(Makes a pawn grow until is goes through the ceiling)'' Too big!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel in the attic with Dipper.''
|-
!Mabel
|This is some kind of magicky thing, isn't it?
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper in Soos' car with Soos.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Holding a tooth)'' Soos! Look!
|-
!Soos
|A real dinosaur tooth?
|-
!
|''Cut to a shot from "Society of the Blind Eye." Dipper is in the attic with the camera zoomed into the tooth hanging over his bed.''
|-
!Dipper
|There's something huge going on right under our noses.
|-
!
|''Cut to a shot from [[Dipper vs. Manliness]]: [[Tyler Cutebiker]] in the gift shop with a puma shirt and a panther shirt.''
|-
!Tyler
|Puma shirt... panther shirt... puma shirt...panther shirt.
|-
!
|''Cut to a shot from [[Scary-oke]]: Tyler is walking into the Mystery Shack with a shirt that is a combination of the puma and panther shirts.''
|-
!Tyler
|Haha! [[Tambry]] sends me the craziest texts!
|-
!Hirsch
|Each audience member gets to ''be'' Dipper, and have a mystery to uncover.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel standing over the decapitated body of Wax Stan.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Flipping through Journal 3)'' In this town, anything is possible.
|-
!Hirsch
|In "[[Not What He Seems]]", Mabel's wearing a key.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel in the yard.''
|-
!Mabel
|Our Grunkle Stan might shoplift the occasional tangerine but he's not some evil supervillain!
|-
!
|''Cut to a newspaper article identifying Stan as an "unnamed grifter"; the government agents arresting Stan and to Stan escaping the police station in zero gravity.''
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel pulling herself along a wire to the portal's deactivation button.''
|-
!Hirsch
|This is because Mabel herself is ultimately the key to unlocking the portal.
|-
!Stan
|Look into my eyes, Mabel! You really think I'm a bad guy?
|-
!Dipper
|He's lying! SHUT IT DOWN NOW!
|-
!Stan
|Mabel, please!
|-
!Portal voice
|Ten, nine...
|-
!Time Baby
|It's time for "Wheel of Secrets!"
|-
!
|''Cut to "Norman" with jam on his face; the gnomes asking Mabel to be their queen; Jeff bathing in squirrels''
|-
!Hirsch
|That red stuff on Norman's mouth: is it blood, or is it jam? It really is jam. The gnomes recently has their gnome queen die, and as part of their funeral ceremony they were all eating bereavement jam.
|-
!Jeff
|This is normal.
|-
!
|''Cut to the Multi-Bear in his cave.''
|-
!Hirsch
|Originally, the [[Multi-Bear]] was going to be called the "Bear Bear," and we specifically wanted a line where Dipper could say, "There, there, Bear Bear."
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, that's a Multi-Bear.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Blendin Blandin]] time-traveling and catching on fire.''
|-
!Hirsch
|We have a reason that Blendin is bald. When he time travels, oftentimes, he does it poorly, and catches on fire. He has to slap himself and it's like
|-
!Hirsch and Blendin
|Uh, pat, pat down.
|-
!Hirsch
|He's burned off all his hair from botched time-traveling.
|-
!Blendin
|I-I don't know if it's some kind of paradox, or if I'm just really tired...
|-
!
|''Cut to McGucket dancing at the lake; laughing maniacally in front of a newspaper article about one of his robots and to him dancing on a car in the junkyard.''
|-
!Hirsch
|We ended up writing a song for [[Old Man McGucket|McGucket]], where he sings about the [[Gobblewonker]] and how it's real and how it's gonna get ya, and then learned two things: one, the song was too long, two, McGucket's a terrible singer.
|-
!McGucket
|That's probably why I live in the dump! ''(Dances)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Footbot dancing in Stan's story; Stan standing in front of his and Ford's science fair projects and to Stan laughing with Footbot, an [[Unnamed beautiful woman|unnamed beautiful woman]] and a bunch of football players.''
|-
!Hirsch
|In "[[A Tale of Two Stans]]," you see that Stan's science fair project that failed in high school was a football robot called "Footbot." This is apparently a dream he has had for a very long time and it's a very dumb dream.
|-
!Time Baby
|You didn't win anything.
|-
!Hirsch
|One secret about the show that not a lot of people know is that some names of incidental characters or side characters that don't really matter in the show...
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Gabe Bensen]] doing a puppet show.''
|-
!Gabe
|Hey, I'm Gabe Bensen, y'all.
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Lee]] and [[Nate]] standing in the yard.''
|-
!Wendy
|''(Offscreen)'' This is Lee and Nate.
|-
!Nate
|''(Punches Lee)''
|-
!Lee
|Ah! Hahaha!
|-
!Hirsch
|A number of them are based on boys my sister had a crush on in middle school and elementary school.
|-
!
|''Cut to Bill, Mabel, Soos, [[Xyler and Craz]] in Stan's mindscape.''
|-
!Xyler
|Awesome comeback, Mabel!
|-
!Mabel
|Don't treat me like a child, Xyler.
|-
!Hirsch
|She called me up and she's like, "What is that guy's name doing in there?" and I was like, "Don't worry, I won't tell anybody," so, please don't tell anybody.
|-
!
|''Cut to Sev'ral Timez's music video.''
|-
!Creggy G.
|''(Singing:)'' Ohhhhh, girl you got me ackin' so cray-cray!
|-
!Chubby Z.
|Cray-cray!
|-
!Deep Chris
|You tell me that you won't be my
|-
!Deep Chris and Creggy G.
|Bay-bay!
|-
!
|''Cut to a Sev'ral Timez poster and to Sev'ral Timez riding by Dipper on a bike.''
|-
!Hirsch
|My sister loved, not just one boy-band, not just two boy-bands, but every boy-band that was a rip-off of the other boy band.
|-
!Creggy G.
|Hey, Dipper!
|-
!Greggy C.
|Hey, Dipper!
|-
!Leggy P.
|Hey, Dipper!
|-
!Chubby Z.
|Hey, Dipper!
|-
!Deep Chris
|Hey, Dipper!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel, Candy and Grenda in the attic and to Sev'ral Timez in the attic.''
|-
!Hirsch
|And she had a poster for all of them on her wall.
|-
!Creggy G.
|Whoa, is that true, Mabel dawg?
|-
!Hirsch
|How is there enough room in your heart to be obsessed with this many boy bands?
|-
!
|''Cut to a kid at a Sev'ral Times concert.''
|-
![[Pacifica's friends|Pacifica's friend]]
|I LOVE YOU, DEEP CHRIS!
|-
!Pacifica's friend 2
|He was talking to me! ''(Hits her with a chair and they fight)''
|-
!
|''An arrow points to friend 2 with the words "[[Ariel Hirsch]]'s voice."''
|-
!Hirsch
|A lot of the show is us making fun of each other, or our friends or our siblings.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan walking into the gift shop.''
|-
!Stan
|Show me the object of ridicule!
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel's [[Smile Dip]] hallucinations.''
|-
!Hirsch
|When Mabel's on the Smile Dip and she's on this crazy sugar trip...
|-
!Flavor Pup
|Would you like to eat my candy paws?
|-
!Mabel
|''(Chewing on the paw)'' Omnomnomnomnom. ''(Cut to real life, where she is chewing on nothing)''
|-
!Hirsch
|When she's riding this dolphin, she says:
|-
!Mabel
|''(Riding [[Aoshima]])'' ONWARDS, AOSHIMA!
|-
!Hirsch
|Now I go to ComicCon, and a hundred kids chant, "ONWARDS AOSHIMA" to me, having no idea that that's just the name of our director, [[John Aoshima]].
|-
!
|''Cut to Aoshima growing two extra arms and four extra faces, which spit rainbows with car alarms, causing it to speed up. Cut to [[Mermando]] in the pool.''
|-
!Mermando
|Hahahaha! I am charmed by your sense of humor.
|-
!Hirsch
|Mermando is voiced by [[Matt Chapman]], one of our writers, who does many voices on the show; he does many of the members of Sev'ral Times...
|-
!
|''Cut to a Sev'ral Times clone gestating and dancing in a tube and to Chubby Z. in a cage, talking to Candy, Grenda and Mabel.''
|-
!Chubby Z.
|But he keeps us in cages! That junk is straight brutal, girl!
|-
!Hirsch
|He is the [[Marius von Fundshauser|Austrian prince]].
|-
!
|''Cut to Marius talking to Grenda.''
|-
!Marius
|There is something about you... I can't get you out of my head... you're so bold and confident.
|-
!Hirsch
|And he is [[Abuelita]].
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Mabel's grappling hook]] hitting a jar of jelly, causing it to shatter and spill jelly all over the wall and floor.''
|-
!Abuelita
|I vacuum de walls now. ''(Vacuums the walls)''
|-
!
|''Cut to Shandra Jimenez at the grand unveling of Wax Stan.''
|-
!Shandra
|Shandra Jimenez, a real reporter.
|-
!Hirsch
|One thing I can tell you about Shandra is that her name is inspired by one of our background artists, [[Sean Jimenez]].
|-
!
|''Cut to a TV among the wreckage of [[Weirdmageddon (event)|Weirdmageddon]] showing Jimenez on the news.''
|-
!Shandra
|I'm Shandra Jimenez, and I ate a rat for dinner.
|-
!Hirsch
|Something that not everyone might now about [[Agent Powers]] is that he is voiced by [[Nick Offerman]]. 
|-
!
|''Cut to Agent Powers and [[Agent Trigger]] in the Mystery Shack gift shop.''
|-
!Powers
|If you have evidence of these claims, we should talk. ''(Gives Dipper a card)''
|-
!Hirsch
|Who is a hilarious comedian.
|-
!
|''Cut to Agents Powers and Trigger in the yard.''
|-
!Powers
|I was born with a rare disorder that makes me physically incapable of experiencing humor.
|-
!
|''Cut to Powers and Trigger in the yard with Dipper, Powers holding Journal 3.''
|-
!Trigger
|I can confirm: not funny.
|-
!Hirsch
|Something people might not know about Agent Trigger: his sort of cheek bones and chin, were kinda modeled after one of our writers, [[Jeff Rowe]], who is the most attractive man in our writer's room.
|-
!
|''Cut to Powers and Trigger in the yard.''
|-
!Trigger
|We survived. Barely.
|-
!Powers
|I used Trigger as a human shield.
|-
!
|''Cut to clips in various episodes with Powers and Trigger highlighted in the background.''
|-
!Time Baby
|And in case you didn't notice, they've been watching the twins the whole time. What about the [[Lamby Lamby Dance|Lamby Dance]], Alex? That was you, wasn't it?
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper.''
|-
!Dipper
|Now is not the time to talk about the Lamby Dance.
|-
!Hirsch
|One of our writers, [[Michael Rianda]], his sister, when he was a child, dressed him up as a lamb and made him do a dance. A lot of people think that was me...
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel holding a photo of Dipper as a small child in a lamb costume and to Dipper in the present singing the song.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Singing:)'' Wellll, who wants a lamby lamby lamby? I do! I do!... forget about the ba-by!
|-
!Hirsch
|Fortunately, it was not. That specifically comes from his traumatic childhood memory.
|-
!
|''Cut to a writer jumping over a cardboard cutout of Gideon; a monster truck running into Hirsch, who is lying down, and to Stan sewing a taxidermy of a yeti with a rainbow wig.''
|-
!Hirsch
|Um, so it's like, all of the writers have a secret sort of personality trait that sneaks into the show.
|-
!Stan
|''(Singing:)'' [[Puttin' a Rainbow Wig on a Big White Gorilla]]
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan, Soos, the twins and Pacifica in the car.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Singing:)'' [[Singing the Driving Song]]. Headlights are out. Can't really see where we're going.
|-
!Hirsch
|That's just something I do. Like if I'm looking for my keys, I'll just be like ''(Stan voice:)'' Where are my keys? Losing my mind, where'd they go?
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos leaving the Mystery Shack.''
|-
!Soos
|''(Singing:)'' Doo do do do do. Walking to my car.
|-
!Time Baby
|Time is running out, Alex. TELL THEM MORE!
|-
!
|''Cut to a crowd at the [[Pioneer Day]] commencement ceremony.''
|-
!Crowd
|USA! USA!
|-
![[America guy]]
|''(Crying)'' USA! USA!
|-
!Hirsch
|Chanting I think would happen a lot in the writers' room.
|-
!
|''Cut to Candy, Grenda, Dipper and Mabel on the streets in their [[Summerween (event)|Summerween]] costumes.''
|-
!Candy, Grenda and Mabel
|Over with! Over with!
|-
!
|''Cut to Candy, Grenda and Mabel in the attic.''
|-
!Grenda
|Beautiful! Beautiful!
|-
!
|''Cut to Candy, Grenda and Mabel chanting in the living room.''
|-
!Hirsch
|Michael Rianda, if it would be lunch time, he would do "Lunch time! Lunch time!"
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel and Soos in the kitchen.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Soos:)'' Lick it! Lick it!
|-
!Hirsch
|I think he did the first chant that ever appeared in the episode, which is all the teens going 
|-
!Hirsch and Wendy, Lee, Nate, Tambry and Robbie
|Thompson! Thompson!
|-
!Hirsch
|It's just an obnoxious thing to do, and once you get used to it, you can't stop.
|-
!
|''Cut to some [[Manotaurs]] in the [[Man Cave]].''
|-
!Manotaurs
|Man! Man! Man!
|-
!
|''Cut to the pictures in the theme song with the picture of Hirsch's chin circled; the pictures on Dipper's list of suspects as to who wrote the journals with the picture of Hirsch circled; a magazine in Stan's childhood room with Hirsch's face on the cover circled; Hirsch in a gondola at [[Mystery Mountain]]; Hirsch standing near Stan and [[Goldie]] in Las Vegas and to Hirsch juggling on a unicycle on a TV.''
|-
!Hirsch
|There's plenty of little cameos of mine in the show where my face will show up. People assume that's like me, like "Oh, ha ha, get this," little ego boost. The crew likes to make fun of me. ''(Laughs)'' And whenever they put my face in the show that's their way of doing it.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel writing a letter in the living room.''
|-
!Mabel
|"Dear Mom and Dad, we've been in Gravity Falls for a few months and so much has happened."
|-
!
|''Cut to a picture of Dipper and Mabel fishing; Dipper and Mabel exploring the [[Abandoned mines]]; Dipper and Mabel rappelling down Gideon's desk; Dipper holding a lantern up the a map Mabel has folded into a hat and to Dipper, Mabel and Soos walking into mist.''
|-
!Hirsch
|Ultimately, Gravity Falls isn't just about coded and Easter eggs; it's about characters. 
|-
!
|''Cut to Soos in [[Soos' pick-up truck|his pick-up truck]] talking to Dipper.''
|-
!Soos
|You need an amiable sidekick with a pick-up truck?
|-
!Dipper
|You know I do.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel and Soos at [[Big Gunz Laser Tag]].''
|-
!Soos
|I know who my family is now, and it's you dudes.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel on the roof.''
|-
!Mabel
|Somebody's in loooove!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper standing over the [[Shape Shifter]], which is disguised as Wendy, in the [[Bunker]].''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Crying)'' I never even got to tell you I'm like... in love with you, Wendy.
|-
!
|''Cut to Wendy and Dipper sitting together.''
|-
!Wendy
|I always... kinda knew.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan  in the underground lab.''
|-
!Stan
|Everything I've worked for, everything I care about, it's all for this family.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan and [[Ford Pines]] in the 60s on [[Glass Shard Beach (landform)|Glass Shard Beach]].''
|-
!Stan
|One of these days, you and me are gonna sail away from this dumb town.
|-
!
|''Cut to Ford and Stan in the Mystery Shack in the present.''
|-
!Ford
|When the summer's over, you give me my house back, you give me my ''name'' back, and this "Mystery Shack" junk is over forever.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel in the Summerween Superstore.''
|-
!Mabel
|I guess I didn't realize it was already our last one.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel in the attic.''
|-
!Dipper
|Look, things aren't gonna stay frozen this way. It's part of growing up. Things change. Summer ends.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Wendy on a roof.''
|-
!Wendy
|This summer, I've seen some amazing things, but nothing as amazing as you and your sister.
|-
!
|''Cut to Mabel at [[Ye Royal Discount Putt Hutt]]; Dipper at the [[Dusk 2 Dawn]]; Dipper cutting the ropes with which the gnomes were holding down Mabel; Dipper jumping and pushing Mabel out of the way of a tree the Gobblewonker pushed down; Dipper at the top of a tree and to Dipper, Mabel and the Gideon-bot falling off of the floating cliffs.''
|-
!Mabel
|AAAAAAAAAA!!
|-
!Soos
|Dudes! NOO!!
|-
!
|''Cut to [[The Undead]] walking towards Dipper and Mabel; Leadaurar breathing fire; Dipper and Mabel being sucked into the pinball machine's mouth; Rumble McSkirmish screaming at Dipper and to Mabel standing on a rock while Mermando jumps over her.''

|-
!
|''Cut to the [[Smarticle Accelerator]] turning on; Bill preparing to attack Mabel and Soos; the [[Stan balloon]] descending on [[Charlie (kid)|Charlie]] and [[Charlie's mother|his mother]]; Ford taking Journal 1 and to Ford being sucked into the portal.''
|-
!Stan
|Oh, no, what do I do?!
|-
!Ford
|Stanley! Stanley! Do something! STANLEEEYY!! ''(Throws the journal at Stan and disappears)''
|-
!Stan
|STANFORD!
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper writing in Journal 3.''
|-
!Dipper
|This journal told me there was no one in Gravity Falls I could trust, but when you battle a hundred gnomes side-by-side with someone, you realize that they've probably always got your back.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper and Mabel high-fiving; Mabel lowering herself and Dipper from the cliffs with her grappling hook; Mabel firing Jeff at the gnomes; Mabel floating in front of the portal as it is about to open; Mabel grabbing a stuffed animal with her grappling hook and to Mabel and Bill in Dipper's body at the [[Theatre Time Theater]].''
|-
!Bill
|I mean, who would sacrifice everything they've worked for just for their dumb sibling?
|-
!
|''Cut to the Gideon-bot holding Dipper and Mabel; Stan arriving at Ford's house in 1982 and to  Stan and Ford walking into a cave in the 60s.''
|-
!Stan
|Don't worry, bro. Wherever we go, we go together.
|-
!
|''Cut to Stan and Ford laughing in the present and to Dipper and Mabel in court in the prison bubble.''
|-
!Dipper
|I don't know what's gonna happen in the future, but whatever it is, you don't have to fear because we'll do it together.
|-
!
|''Cut to Bill smashing something; Mabel turning on her light bulb sweater; Stan fighting zombies and to Bill laughing as people run in terror.''
|-
!Shandra
|''(Offscreen)'' Is there no one who will save the people of this town?
|-
!Dipper
|Let's beat Bill and grow up together!
|-
!
|''Cut to the flyer for Dipper and Mabel's birthday party rustling in the wind; Ford emerging from the portal and to Mabel, Dipper, Soos and Wendy riding Waddles out of Mabeland.''

|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper, Mabel, Soos and Wendy preparing to be attacked at the Mystery Shack's porch.''
