|''Short opens with [[Mabel Pines]] in a rocking chair with her scrapbook of memories.''
|-
!Mabel
|Welcome to "Mabel's Scrapbook." Ah, here's a good memory! That one time we all went to the movies!
|-
!
|''We see the photo of cinema in scrapbook signed "Stand-off at [[The Royal Ragtime Theatre|The Ragtime]]." Cut to the cinema. Current premiere sign is "Now Showing [[Pony Heist]]."''
|-
![[Stan Pines|Stan]]
|''(After buying tickets)'' Twelve bucks a ticket? Pony Heist better be the best movie ever made!
|-
!Mabel
|I wrote a list of hilarious jokes to yell out during the movie. Pony Heist? More like BALONEY Heist! Right? ''(Turns to Laughter Fox poster)'' This guy gets me!
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]], Mabel, Stan and [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] entering the cinema.''
|-
!Dipper, Mabel, Stan & Soos
|Movies! Movies! Movies! Movies! Movies! Movies! Movies!
|-
!
|''A candy bar wrapper falls out of Mabel's sweater and [[Thompson]], walking past them, notices it and picks it up.''
|-
!Thompson
|Hey, you stop! There is no outside food or drink allowed in the theater!
|-
!Mabel
|Well, it's just one candy.
|-
!Stan
|Yeah! I wanna talk to the manager!
|-
!Thompson
|I AM the manager! Your family is banned!
|-
!
|''Cut to the outside. The Pines and Soos are sitting on the pavement.''
|-
!Mabel
|No ponies...
|-
!Soos
|No explosions...
|-
!Dipper
|''(Stands up)'' Guys, we are NOT going down like this! I've got a plan to break in.
|-
!
|''Everyone gathers in a circle.''
|-
!Dipper
|Okay, it's gonna go down like this.
|-
!
|''Cut to the Stan sitting near to the closed exit door.''
|-
!Dipper
|Stan will get us in using his incredible lock-picking skills.
|-
!Stan
|''(Smashes the lock with a rock and walks in. To [[Lee]] and [[Nate]] working in the cinema:)'' Hey, suckers! Ahahahaha! ''(Runs off with them in chase)''
|-
!Soos
|''(Soos, dressed as loader, enters with a trolley with a box on it. Dipper jumps out of the box)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating:)'' Stan's diversion will allow me and Soos to get inside. The next step is to get Thompson away from the snack stand. Fortunately, I have my ways. ''(In real time, changes the title "Monkey Business 2" to "Thompson drinks popcorn butter."''
|-
!Thompson
|What? No I don't! ''(Runs away)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating:)'' This will get Mabel just enough time to coat herself entirely in syrup.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Gets in the syrup bucket and rubs syrup all over herself)'' This is my favorite part!
|-
!Thompson
|''(Off-screen)'' Hey! ''(Opens the bucket, but doesn't see Mabel)'' What?
|-
!Mabel
|''(On the ceiling, heading to the ventilation bars. She picks up a gummy bear stuck onto the ceiling, then eats it. Mabel is shown entering the ventilation ducts, and later kicking the ventilation bars and signaling them to enter.)''
|-
!
|''Dipper opens the ventilation bars in the screening room. The gang slides down a rope to the screening room.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating:)'' If all goes according the plan, we should arrive in the theatre in exactly the amount of time it takes for the previews to end.
|-
!
|''The gang sticks to the glass wall with wide open smiles. Cut to Dipper's watch beeping.''
|-
!Dipper
|43 minutes!
|-
!Mabel, Soos & Stan
|Whoohoo! Alright! Yes!
|-
!
|''Cuts to the "Pony Heist" movie.''
|-
!Movie narrator
|''(A pink and purple pony starts to run in the movie)'' But the ponies are filled with—TNT! ''(two ponies crash and explode in the movie)''
|-
!
|''The gang sits in the screening room and laughs. Mabel brings her "Pony Heist jokes" page, reading it out loud for the croud.''
|-
!Mabel
|"Pony Heist"? More like BALONEY-Heist! Am I right?!
|-
!
|''The whole crowd laughs and enjoys the joke. Dipper and Mabel high-five each other.''
|-
!Dipper
|Hey, look! ''(pointing at a TV screen)''
|-
!
|''The TV screen shows Thompson drinking a huge bottle of butter. The gang laughs and Mabel takes a picture with her camera.''
|-
!Soos
|I'd do the same, though...
|-
!
|''Cuts to Mabel's Scrapbook with a new picture on it of Thompson drinking butter. Mabel closes the Scrapbook, showing its title. End.''
