!Mabel
|Wow! There were a lot of good memories this summer! ''(Turns over the pages)'' Whether it was battling gnomes, solving mysteries, or winning that dog sled race against that space lizard! But I'll never forget that trip to the petting zoo...

|-
![[Dipper Pines|Dipper]]
|Wow! I didn't think nature would allow this!
|-
![[Stan Pines|Stan]]
|Yeah! ''(To [[Sprott]]:)'' Pig farmer! What gives?
|-
!Sprott
|Octavia? Well, she's just another blessin' from the toxic flood running off the Mud Flat factory.
|-
!
|''Behind Sprott, we see a goat drinking from the toxic river, growing another head, and dying.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Laughs as Octavia licks her)'' I could pet this cow forever!
|-
!Sprott
|Well, get your pettin' done now 'cause I'm gonna eat 'er come cow eatin' season.

|''Everyone except Sprott gasps.''
|-
!Mabel

!Stan
|So you wanna eat the freak to gain its mutant powers. I respect that.
|-
!
|''They start to walk away.''
|-
!Mabel
|Grunkle Stan! We can't let Octavia be eaten!
|-
!Stan
|Come on, Mabel! Cows are delicious!
|-
!Mabel
|But we love her! ''(Hugs Octavia's nose)''
|-
!Stan
|''(Looks at Mabel petting Octavia, then looks at Sprott far away imagining Octavia as a hamburger; Octavia licks Stan and he sighs)'' Warm up the truck.
|-
!
|''Everyone but Stan cheers. Cut to the "Petting Zoo" sign with a smaller sign under it saying "CLOSED," and a dad with two children exiting the Petting Zoo. Cut to the farm near the main "Petting Zoo" sign. An old phone rings. Sprott answers the call.''
|-
!Sprott
|Howdy!
|-
!Soos
|''(On the other end:)'' Hey! I'm calling from "Pictures of Tractors Monthly"! Please hold for an important message. ''(Plays on a little organ and sings:)'' Da-ra-ta-ra-to! Ta-ra-ta-pa-da-ba-bo! This is definitely a real message -ta-ra-pa-po!
|-
!
|''Soos is seen through the window near Sprott. Soos plays and sings on the top of Stan's truck while Dipper, Mabel and Stan are loading Octavia on the back of the truck. Dipper, Mabel, Soos and Stan are entering the truck and Stan starts driving. Just now Sprott notices the theft.''
|-
!Sprott
|They're stealin' Octavia! [[Emmit and D'Shawn|Emmit! D'Shawn!]] Close the gate!
|-
!
|''Emmit pulls a handle under the sign "GATE." Cuts to Stan's truck driving with Octavia, while the gates are closed. Stan makes a sharp turn to the Sheep Pen, breaking some fences. Cut to the truck's front view with the gang.''
|-
!Mabel
|Sheep! Dodge! Dodge!
|-
!Stan
|''(Dodges a few sheep while driving)'' Brace yourselves!
|-
!
|''Everyone screams. The truck goes on a ramp and jumps over some hay.''
|-
!Emmit and D'Shawn
|''(Waving their fists in anger)'' Ugh...
|-
!Sprott
|Serves me right for buildin' an escape ramp.
|-
!
|''Cuts to the gang releasing the cow in the woods.''
|-
!Mabel
|Goodbye, Octavia. Here's a little something to remember us by.

|-
!Wendy
|Goodbye, Octavia!
|-
!Soos
|Have beautiful babies!
|-
!Mabel
|I love you!
|-
!Stan
|She was alright for a mutant.
|-
!
|''Cuts to Octavia eating grass sweetly. A bird passes by, and suddenly Octavia shoots green lasers from her eyes and burns the bird. The burned bird falls to the ground and Octavia sticks her mutated long tongue to pull the bird to her mouth, aggressively eating the bird. Cuts to the terrified gang.''
|-
!Stan
|Run.
|-
!
|''Everybody starts to run, except Mabel, who's taking a picture. Cuts to Mabel's Scrapbook, with the picture of Octavia's laser eyes. "Don't have a cow!" is written under the picture.''
