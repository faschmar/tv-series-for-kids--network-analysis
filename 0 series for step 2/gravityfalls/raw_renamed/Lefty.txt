![[Dipper Pines]]
|Alright, uh. Welcome back to ''[[Shorts#Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained|Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained]]''. ''(Holds up title card)'' Today we investigate Gravity Falls Anomaly #82.
|-
!
|''Camera pans over to the [[Lefty robot|left-facing man]].''
|-
!Dipper
|This guy. Sure he looks normal, but if he's so normal explain why he's always facing left.
|-
!
|''Static. The man is at the grocery store performing complicated tasks facing the left side.''
|-
!Dipper
|
Literally, I've been following him around for weeks.
|-
!
|''Static. The man is running around the park, and begins to run backward around the track.''
|-
!Dipper
|And I've never once seen the right side of his face.
|-
!
|''Static. The man is in front of the escalator, steps up backward to get on.''
|-
!Dipper
|And neither has anyone else. But why?
|-
!
|''Static.''
|-
!Dipper
|[[Mabel Pines|Mabel]]? Theories?
|-
!Mabel Pines 
|''(Holds up pictures)'' Theory one: He's hiding an embarassing sunburn. Theory two: Half-man, half lizard-man. And theory number three, my personal favorite: He's normal! And Dipper's just crazy!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Takes the picture)'' That's not a theory, that doesn't count as a theory.
|-
!Mabel
|Ha ha ha! He he!
|-
!Dipper
|We find out now! ''(pants and goes into the [[Bowling alley]])'' Hello, good sir!
|-
!Lefty
|I'm sorry, cameras aren't allowed in here.
|-
!Dipper
|Oh, it's not on. Not on. ''(Acts like he's turning off the camera but doesn't; whispering to the audience) ''He bought it.'' (To the lefty man) ''So, would you mind grabbing those bowling shoes for me? The ones on your ''right side?''
|-
!Lefty
|Those ones? ''(Dipper nods and Lefty puts them on the counter without turning around)''
|-
!Dipper
|Whoops! Oh no, I... dropped my wallet! ''(Throws wallet)'' It's over to your right there. Your ''right'' side. Could maybe turn around and...
|-
!Lefty
|''(Sighs and picks up wallet without turning around)'' There you are, sir.
|-
!Dipper
|Fine... Could you just get me my bowling ball?
|-
!Lefty
|I don't see why not.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Follows him with camera)''
|-
!Lefty
|(''Mutters to himself'') Let's see, look like maybe a ten, or...
|-
!Dipper
|Well, I was thinking it could be the... ''(Turns the man around and reveals the robot side)'' Ah ha! What the...?!
|-
![[Little green men|Fish Alien #1]]
|''(One alien notices)'' Guys!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Zooms in on the fish aliens gasping, then on his and Mabel's reactions)''
|-
!Fish Alien #2
|We're blown! Shut it down! Shut it down!
|-
!Fish Aliens
|''(Takes suicide pills)'' The time has come!
|-
!Fish Alien #2
|The time has come, brother!
|-
!Fish Alien #1
|I can't! I have a family!
|-
!Fish Alien #2
|You signed the oath! ''(Takes his pill)''
|-
!Fish Alien #1
|''(Takes pill)''
|-
!Fish Alien #2
|
''(Screams)''
|-
!Fish Aliens
|''(Explodes)''
|-
!
|''The lefty robot collapses and explodes, and the fire sprinklers turn on.''
|-
!Man #1
|Aw, come on!
|-
!Man #2
|The sprinklers are on!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Running away, along with Mabel)'' Well, that concludes anomaly #82. Uh, I think we might want to burn this tape.
|-

|''Static. A part of the hidden page is shown.''
