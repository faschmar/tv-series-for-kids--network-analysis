|''The episode opens with a picture of a waterfall. [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] starts to narrate.''
|-
!Dipper Pines
|''(Narrating:)'' Ah, summer break.
|-
!
|''While Dipper talks, the picture shifts to another one depicting children building a sand castle, then one of a man grilling burgers at a barbecue, and then one of a man sleeping in a hammock.''
|-
!Dipper
|A time for leisure, recreation, and taking 'er easy.
|-
!
|''The camera moves away from the pictures, revealing that they are parts of the "[[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]]" billboard.''
|-
!Dipper
|Unless you're me.
|-
!
|''[[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] and Dipper Pines crash through the "Gravity Falls" billboard with the [[Mystery Cart]] and fall down, screaming. They are being chased by unknown [[Gnomes|monsters]]. The monsters roar. The image freezes with Dipper screaming.''
|-
!Dipper
|My name is Dipper. The girl about to puke is my sister Mabel. You're probably wondering what we're doing, in a golf cart, being chased by a tidal wave of horror. Well, I—I'll tell ya.
|-
!
|''The image turns into a viewfinder disc. It shifts to the next image, showing Dipper and Mabel at home.''
|-
!Dipper
|It all began when our [[Dipper and Mabel's parents|parents]] decided we could use some fresh air.
|-
!
|''Their parents take their stuff away, give them bags and put some sunscreen on their noses. The image shifts to a map of Oregon. Zoom in to Gravity Falls.''
|-
!
Dipper
|They sent us up north to Gravity Falls, Oregon, to stay with our great uncle [[Stan Pines|Stan]] at his "museum of mystery."
|-
!
|''The image shifts to Stan knocking in a "no refunds" sign in front of the [[Mystery Shack]]. Shifts to Dipper cleaning a jar containing a skeleton of siamese babies.''
|-
!
Dipper
|Since then, something unbelievable happens... pretty much every day. Like that fishing trip.
|-
!
|''The image shifts to Dipper, Mabel and Stan on a boat over the head of a [[Gobblewonker|giant lake monster]]. Dipper takes a photo, while Stan fishes and Mabel relaxes, both unknowingly. The image shifts to the shack's living room.''
|-
!
Dipper
|Or the whole... telekinesis incident.
|-
!
|''Mabel stares concentratedly at a spoon, while Stan and his couch start levitating. The image shifts to a landscape with a waterfall, the camera moves down to a forest and the viewfinder disc frame disappears.''
|-
!
Dipper
|But this particular story happened just a few days ago.
|-
!
|''Shows the Mystery Shack. Cut to Stan pulling a rope that rings a bell in the attic, where the siblings are reading magazines.''
|-
!Stan Pines
|''(Shouting offscreen:)'' Kids!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Not narrating:) ''We're sleeping!
|-
!Stan
|''(Ringing the bell and shouting offscreen:)'' Kids!
|-
!Mabel Pines
|We're dead!
|-
!
|''The bell keeps ringing and the kids look at each other, annoyed. Cut to Stan downstairs scratching his back with his cane. Mabel and Dipper arrive.''
|-
!Stan
|Ah, there they are, my favorite twins: Dylan and... Rowena!
|-
!Dipper
|Dipper.
|-
!Mabel
|Mabel.
|-
!Stan
|I'm getting closer though.
|-
!Dipper
|No, I don't know... I think it's... I think it's pretty much the opposite.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Simultaneously'' w''hispering:)'' Yeah I don't know, I think it's getting worse.
|-
!Stan
|As you kids know, my Mystery Shack is home to the world's strangest roadside befuddlements. ''(Points at something)''
|-
!
|''Cut to an apelike figure wearing underwear, with a sign that reads "The Sascrotch."''
|-
!Stan
|The Sascrotch!
|-
!
|''Cut to a cat figure with a horn on its head.''
|-
!Stan
|The uni-cat.
|-
!
|''Cut to a tarantula with an antropomorphic mouth, the eyes and nose of a bat and an antropomorphic foot that sticks out of its body.''
|-
!Stan
|The... eh... whatever that thing is. But now, behold! (''Uncovers a model of the London Bridge made out of popsicles) ''A scale model of London Bridge, built entirely from freezy pops!
|-
!
|''Mabel and Dipper clap dispiritedly.''
|-
!Stan
|And just like the real London Bridge, it's indestructi... ''(Taps the model, causing it to fall apart) ''You kids want to eat two hundred freezy pops?
|-
!Dipper
|Yeah!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Simultaneously:) ''Ye-he-es!
|-
!
|''Cut to the three of them eating popsicles in the dining room.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Pops a posicle stick out of his mouth) ''Alright, here's a good one. ''(Reading the stick:) ''"What is a ghost's favorite ice cream flavor?"
|-
!Mabel
|''(Bangs the table and pops a popsicle out of her mouth) ''Boo-berry! It's obviously boo-berry.
|-
!Stan
|How's about corpse melon.
|-
!Mabel
|It's BOO-berry!
|-
!Dipper
|I'm thinking cookies and scream. ''(Looking at the stick)'' And the answer is... Wha... that's weird.
|-
!
|''The camera shows the stick is blank.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Intrigued:)'' That's blank.
|-
!Stan
|''(Bangs the table)'' Blank stick, that's a bad omen! What! Something terrible will happen in ''(counting down with his fingers)'' three... two... one. You know, like a telephone will ring, or...
|-
!
|''The door bell rings.''
|-
!Mabel
|Ah! He's here! ''(Looks at the door)''
|-
!Stan
|There we go.
|-
!
|''Mabel rushes to the door.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Holds Mabel)'' Hold it sis. Who's here?
|-
!Mabel
|Well, time to spill the beans. ''(Knocking over an actual can of beans)'' Proup. ''(To Dipper:)'' I've been seeing someone.
|-
!Dipper
|Whoa wait, wait. We've only been in town for a week, and you already have a boyfriend?
|-
!Mabel
|What can I say? I guess I'm just ''(growling:)'' IRRESISTIBLEEE.
|-
!
|''The door bell rings again.''
|-
!Mabel
|Ah! COMING!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating:) ''This didn't sound good. Mabel's romances always ended in disaster.
|-
!
|''Flashback of Mabel on her bed staring at a ten dollar bill.''
|-
!Dipper
|Like the time she fell for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander&#x20;Hamilton the guy on the ten dollar bill].
|-
!Mabel
|''(Sighs)''
|-
!
|''Flashback of Mabel at "The Mattress Prince" store.''
|-
!Dipper
|Or her crush on the Mattress Prince.
|-
!Mattress Prince
|Come on, come all! To my kingdom of savings!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Comes out from a bunch of balloons. Whispering:)'' Take me with you.
|-
!Mattress Prince
|''(Scared:)'' Aaaaaah!
|-
!
|''Cut back to the dining room.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Stan:)'' Wonder who she dug up this time.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Comes from behind the door frame)'' Hey guys! ''(Pulling someone)'' I want to introduce you to somebody.
|-
!
|''Pulls a pale teen, apparently older than her, who has dark hair, wears a black hoodie and black rimmel, has branches stuck in his hair and a red spot on his cheek.''
|-
!Norman
|''(Clumsily waving his hand)'' Sup!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Not narrating:)'' Hey.
|-
!Stan
|How is it hanging?
|-
!Mabel
|We met at the cementery. ''(Looking at Norman and fondling his arm:)'' He's really sensitive. Oh! Little muscle there! ''(Whispering:)'' That's... what a surprise.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Suspicius, to Mabel's boyfriend:)'' So, what's your name?
|-
!Norman
|''(Nervous:)'' Ahhh... Normal... MAN!
|-
!Mabel
|He means Norman.
|-
!Dipper
|Are you bleeding, Norman?
|-
!Norman
|''(The red substance on his cheek drips)'' It's jam!
|-
!Mabel
|Ah... I love jam! ''(Hits Norman's chest with her hand; to Dipper and Stan:) ''Look at this!
|-
!Norman
|''(Hesitant:)'' So, you wanna go hold hands, or... whatever?
|-
!Mabel
|Oh! Oh my godness! ''(Giggles; to Dipper and Stan:)'' Don't wait up!
|-
!
|Mabel leaves. ''Norman points at Dipper and Stan and then stumbles his way out. He breaks something.''
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan, did Mabel's boyfriend look weird to you?
|-
!Stan
|Naah, teenagers all look like that.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Meditative:)'' His skin was falling off.
|-
!Stan
|Ha! Ahh, it's nothing. Trust me, I've been in the mystery bussiness since you were in diapers.
|-
!Dipper
|Don't ''you'' wear diapers?
|-
!Stan
|Please, please. They're called ''Grampers. (Takes out a bag of adult diapers)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Disgusted:)'' O-ho! Come on. ''(Runs away)''
|-
!Stan
|A-ha-ha! Ahh. Yup.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper laying on his bed.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating:)'' To take my mind off my sister's creepy boyfriend, I decided to enjoy some light reading. ''(Takes out and dusts a big old book called "Dr. Crackpot's book of the damned." Reading out loud:) "''Known for their open wounds and poor motor skills, these creatures are often mistaken for... TEENAGERS!"
|-
!
|''The camera shows a page of the book, with the title [[Zombies|"undead creatures"]] and the picture of a zombie.''
|-
!Dipper
|"Beware of the nefarious..." ''(He scares) ''Ah!
|-
!
|''He imagines lightnings and the picture turning into Norman.''
|-
!Norman
|Sup!
|-
!Dipper
|ZOMBIE! ''(Echoes)''
|-
!
|''Zooms out. Cut to Stan on his couch, eating another popsicle.''
|-
!Stan
|''(Hears Dipper's echoes; to a deer figure next to him:)'' You said something?
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper in the attic looking at Mabel and Norman through the window. They're sitting, Mabel puts her arm around his shoulders. She giggles.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating:)'' Was it possible? My sister dating the living dead? I had to be sure.
|-
!
|''Fades to Dipper holding a video camera, secretly recording Mabel and Norman from some bushes. Mabel throws a frisbee at Norman, but he doesn't react, gets hit and falls face down to the ground. Cut to Mabel and Norman dancing at a dancing class in a bowling alley. Norman moves clumsily while growling in effort, stumbles and falls over a table. Cut to them feeding birds. A bunch of vultures attacks Norman. Dipper pops out from behind a "Retardant Racoon Sez" sign, holding a binocular.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Narrating:)'' I'd seen enough.
|-
!
|''Cut to the attic. Mabel changes Alexander Hamilton's framed picture for a photo of Norman. Dipper enters.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Not narrating; concerned:) ''Mabel! We gotta talk. Norman is not what he seems. ''(Takes out "Dr. Crackpot's book of the damned"; dramatic organ music plays)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Astonished:)'' Ah! ''(Whispering:)'' You think he might be a vampire? ''(Loudly:)'' That would be so awesome!
|-
!Dipper
|Guess again sister... Sha-bam! ''(Opens the book at the page about [[gnomes]])''
|-
!Mabel
|Aaah!
|-
!Dipper
|Oh wait, I'm sorry... ''(Turns to the undead creatures page)'' Sha-bam!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Skeptical:)'' A zombie? That is not funny, Dipper.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Concerned:)'' I'm not joking! It all adds up: the vultures, the limp... ''(Turns to Mabel) ''He never blinks! Have you noticed that?
|-
!Mabel
|Maybe he's blinking when ''you're'' blinking.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sarcastically:)'' Yee-eah. That makes a lot of sense.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Getting closer)'' It makes more sense than your ''zombie'' theory. Why can't you just trust me?
|-
!Dipper
|''(Scared:)'' BECAUSE IT'S GONNA EAT YOUR BRAIN!
|-
!Mabel
|Dipper! Listen to me. ''(Angrily:)'' Norman and I are going on a date at five o'clock, and I'm gonna be ''adorable''... ''(Strikes Dipper's chest with her finger)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ouch.
|-
!Mabel
|...and he's gonna be dreamy... ''(Strikes Dipper again, pushing him out of the room)''
|-
!Dipper
|Ouch. Wait!
|-
!
|...and I'm not gonna let you ruin it with one of your crazy CONSPIRACIES!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Simultaneously:)'' Bu-bu-bu-but.
|-
!
|''Mabel slams the door.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs)'' What am I gonna do?
|-
!
|''Cut to a cuckoo clock marking a few minutes to one. It fades to the clock marking five o'clock and making an owl noise. Stan is eating popsicles on his couch.''
|-
!Stan
|Meh...
|-
!
|''The door bell rings.''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Running downstairs:)'' Coming! ''(Opens the door)'' Hey Norman! How do I look? ''(Shows off her glittering purple "meow wow!" sweater)''
|-
!Norman
|Shiny!
|-
!Mabel
|Ah. ''(Delighted:)'' You always know what to say.
|-
!
|''Mabel and Norman get out, holding hands.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Sighs and looks at his video camera, watching a video of Norman and Mabel playing hopscotch, where Norman falls)'' Maybe I ''was'' seeing something that wasn't there. ''(Watching another video where one of Norman's hands falls to the ground and he picks it up) ''I guess I can be kinda paranoid, sometimes. Wait! WHAT? ''(Rewinds the last video and watches it again) ''Aaaah!'' (Falls from a chair. Shocked:) ''I WAS RIGHT! Oh my gosh, of my gosh. Grunkle Stan! ''(He trips and falls)'' Agh! Grunkle Stan! Grunkle Stan!
|-
!
|''Cut to Grunkle Stan sitting on his couch.''
|-
!Dipper
|Grunkle Stan! ''(Knocks over a small table with a lamp) ''I need to borrow your golf cart so I can save my sister from a ZOMBIE!
|-
!Stan
|''(Hands the keys to Dipper)'' Try not to hit any pedestrians.
|-
!
|''Cut to Dipper starting the golf cart. He backs off and knocks a statue.''
|-
!Dipper
|Sorry!
|-
!
|''Cut to Norman and Mabel in a park.''
|-
!Norman
|Ehh... Mabel, now that we've got to know each other, there's... ''(blows)'' something I should tell you.
|-
!Mabel
|Oh, Norman, you can tell me anything! ''(Thinking:)'' Please be a vampire, please be a vampire.
|-
!Norman
|All right, just... ''(turns around)'' just don't freak out, okey, just... just keep an open mind, be cool! ''(Takes off his hoodie)''
|-
!
|''Norman turns out to be one gnome standing on top of another four gnomes, one controlling each limb.''
|-
!Jeff
|''(Moves his hair)'' Is this weird? Is this too weird? Do you need to sit down?
|-
!
|''Mabel is in shock.''
|-
!Jeff
|R-r-right, I-I'll explain. So... we're gnomes! ...first off, get that one out of the way.
|-
!Mabel
|''(Shocked:)'' A—ahh...
|-
!Jeff
|I'm Jeff, and ''(pointing down)'' here we have Carson, Steve, Jason and... I'm sorry, I always forget your name.
|-
!Shmebulock
|Shmebulock.
|-
!Jeff
|Shmebulock! Yes! Anyways, long story short, us gnomes have been LOOKING for a new queen. Right, guys?
|-
!
|''Mabel sits down and face palms.''
|-
!Carson, Steve, Jason and Smebulock
|Queeeen! Queeeen! Queeeen! Queen!
|-
!Jeff
|Ha, so what do you say? ''(Knocks Steve's head with his foot twice)''
|-
!
|''"Norman" kneels and offers Mabel a wedding ring.''
|-
!Jeff
|Would you join us in holy matrignomy? Matri-matrimony! Blah! Can't talk today!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Uncomfortable:)'' Phhhh... Look, I'm sorry guys. You're really sweet, but... I'm a girl, and you're gnomes, and it's like... whaaat? ''(Whispering:)'' Yikes.
|-
!Jeff
|We understand. We'll never forget you Mabel... because we're gonna kidnap you.
|-
!Mabel
|Ah?
|-
!
|''The gnomes jump over Mabel.''
|-
!Gnomes
|Arghh!
|-
!Mabel
|Aaaaah-ah-aah!
|-
!
|''Dipper arrives in the golf cart.''
|-
!Dipper
|I'm coming for ya! ''(Surpised:)'' Mabel?
|-
!
|''Dipper finds Mabel tied up and being carried away by the gnomes.''
|-
!Dipper
|WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE?
|-
!Mabel
|Norman turned out to be a bunch of gnomes!
|-
!Dipper
|Gnomes! Why not? ''(Slaps his own forehead)''
|-
!
|''The gnomes enter the forest and Dipper chases them with the cart.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Through the cart's speaker:)'' Attention gnomes! Hand over my sister!
|-
!Gnome
|Naah! ''(Throws a pine cone at Dipper)''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Through the speakers:)'' Is that all you got?!
|-
!
|''There is a bunch of gnomes on the trees at the sides of the road.''
|-
!Gnomes
|Ayayayayayayayayayayayay!
|-
!Dipper
|Aaaaaah!
|-
!
|''Some gnomes jump over the cart and start tearing its roof.''
|-
!Gnome
|Arrgh! Nanana! Aaah!
|-
!Dipper
|Aaaah!
|-
!
|''Dipper punches a gnome off the cart. Then he lifts Shmebulock and slams him against the wheel.''
|-
!Shmebulock
|''(Moaning:)'' Shmebulock! Ah! Aaah!
|-
!
|''Some gnomes on the trees use bows to fire other gnomes as if they were arrows.''
|-
!Gnomes
|Aaaah!
|-
!
|''Dipper dodges these gnomes and reaches Mabel.''
|-
!Dipper
|Mabel! You have to jump!
|-
!Mabel
|I'm tied up.
|-
!Dipper
|Use your braces!
|-
!
|''Mabel cuts the rope with her braces as if they were a saw, walks over her kidnappers heads and jumps into the cart. Dipper takes a side road and gets away from the gnomes. He and Mabel high-five.''
|-
!Dipper
|Ha!
|-
!
|''A gnome falls over the cart's hood. He screeches and jumps onto Dipper's face, blocking his sight.''
|-
!Dipper
|Aaah!
|-
!Mabel
|I'll save you Dipper! ''(Punches the gnome repeatedly)''
|-
!Dipper
|Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah!
|-
!
|''The gnome falls off Dipper's face.''
|-
!Dipper
|''(Dizzy)'' Thanks, Mabel.
|-
!Mabel
|Don't mention it. ''(Pointing ahead)'' Hey, what's that.
|-
!
|''They fall off a cliff.''
|-
!Mabel and Dipper
|''(Falling)'' Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! ''(They hug)''
|-
!
|''The cart crashes through the "Gravity Falls" billboard and into the forest. Cut to the crashed cart. Dipper and Mabel are on the ground, safe.''
|-
!Dipper and Mabel
|''(Sighs of relief)''
|-
!Mabel
|Well, I think we lost them. ''(She realizes they're surrounded by gnomes) ''O-oh.
|-
!Gnomes
|''(Growls and squeals)''
|-
!Mabel
|''(Scared:)'' Ooh-o-oh!
|-
!Gnome King
|''(Shouts offscreen:)'' ENOUGH!
|-
!
|''Gets down a tree and closer to the twins, using his long white beard to move around, as if it was a limb. The gnomes kneel.''
|-
!Gnome King
|''(With a loud and high pitched voice:)'' My queen! The time has come to fulfill your destiny!
|-
!Dipper
|STEP BACK, MAN!
|-
!Mabel
|You're old!
|-
!Gnome King
|As it is written in the Prophecy of Shmiseldorf!

!Mabel
|Go away!

|I will fight you, dude!
|-
!Gnome King
|Prophecy of... ''(gets hit by a shoe thrown by Dipper) ''Ouch! Alright, fine. You want her back? There's only one way!
|-
!Gnomes
|''(Giggles)''
|-
!Gnome King
|You must answer... A RIDDLE!
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Mabel:)'' A riddle? Like a question or...?
|-
!Mabel
|''(To Dipper:)'' A mention... ''(Mumbles)'' Sure, it's probably this.
|-
!Dipper
|''(To Mabel:) ''One of those, okey. ''(To the Gnome King:)'' FINE! RIDDLE ME!
|-
!Gnome King
|Whaaat... IS A GHOST'S FAVORITE ICE CREAM FLAVOR!

!Gnome King

|-
!Mabel
|''(Whispering to Dipper:)'' Boo-berry!
|-
!Dipper
|''(Whispering to Mabel:)'' Cookies and scream!
|-
!Mabel
|''(Whispering and begging:)'' Dipper, trust me just this once.
|-
!Dipper
|''(Whispering:)'' You were wrong about Norman!
|-
!Mabel
|So were you!
|-
!Dipper

|-
!Mabel
|''(Sighs)'' I'm sorry for ignoring your advice. You really were just looking out for me.
|-
!Dipper
|Aww... don't be like that. You saved our butts back there!
|-
!Mabel
|I guess I'm just sad that my first boyfriend turned out to be a bunch of gnomes.
|-
!Dipper
|Look at the bright side! Maybe the next one ''will'' be a vampire.
|-
!Mabel
|Aww-o-o-oh! You're just saying that. ''(Punches Dipper in a friendly manner)''
