==Ketchup Rap==
::{{D|Event|Gumball opens the fridge to find an empty ketchup bottle}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Groans}}

::{{D|Event|Gumball raps about ketchup as he makes his way through the neighborhood}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: ''On my way to buy some ketchup, I'm feeling pretty good.''

:''Gonna take it right on home and then I'll cover all my food.''

:''Ketchup is my favorite sauce, it is the condiment of kings!''

:''Ketchup, you're so useful, you taste great on many things!''

:''You can use it on a burger, or spaghetti bolognese.''

:''You can use it to clean your ears or even wash your face!''

:''On pizza, pasta, chops, or cookies as a main or on the side.''

:''Hair gel, salad dressing, or to grease a slip-and-slide.''

:''It's good for steak, cake, coffee break, roast hake,''

:''a pasta bake! If you drink some in the morning it'll make you feel awake!''

:''On fries, shish kebab, on bacon, crab, or toast, you can fry it, steam it,''

:''boil it, bake it, use it on a roast.''

:''On meats, beets, cheese, wheat, sweets, and treats''

:''and with a little chili for a touch of extra heat''

:''it's not just there for you to eat,''

:''when dried, it works like concrete.''

:''To shine your boots, on veg, on fruits,''

:''to clean your shirts, your socks, your suits,''

:''to lubricate a creaky door, to clean your teeth,''

:''to clean a floor, to paint a painting you have painted,''

:''revive old ladies who fainted, to give your quiche a little lift,''

:''an unexpected Christmas gift, it's always guaranteed''

:''to make an awesome fake nose bleed.''

:''But my favorite use for ketchup's not on fries or roasted hog,''

:''where I love ketchup most is on a big juicy hot dog—''

::{{D|Event|While Gumball is rapping, he is interrupted by Hot Dog Guy bumping into him, who drops his phone}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Surprised; monologue}} ''Oh, no, it's Hot Dog Guy again...''

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: {{D|Event|Monologue}} ''Oh, no, him...''

::{{D|Event|Both Gumball and Hot Dog Guy start groaning in an awkward silence. They try to pick up the phone but accidentally hold hands, startled, they leap out before both trying again and pushing their faces together by mishap}}

:{{D|Both}}: {{D|Event|At the same time}} Well, this is awkward. {{D|Event|Pull back}} It's like we're in sync... and now we're both talking at... right, I'll just stop talking and you can...

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Monologue}} ''Okay. The only way we get out of sync...''

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: {{D|Event|Monologue}} ''...is if I say something really unexpected like:''

:{{D|Both}}: Business clown! Meat flan! Thunder quack!

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Sighs}} Just pick up your phone and let's never talk again, okay?

::{{D|Event|Hot Dog Guy picks up his phone}}

:{{D|Both}}: {{D|Event|Sigh}} Okay, bye!

::{{D|Event|They accidentally walk in the same direction and, nervously trying to break sync, simultaneously and continuously step forwards and backwards}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Irritated}} Maybe I'll just cross the road.

::{{D|Event|Gumball walks into a construction site on the sidewalk}}

:{{D|Hank (construction man)}}: {{D|Event|While drilling}} Hey, what are you doing?

:{{D|Gumball}}: Trust me, it's better this {{D|Event|Falls into the manhole}} WAY!

::{{D|Event|Cuts to Hot Dog Guy walking to a red stoplight. Gumball climbs out of the manhole next to it, soaking wet}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Irritated}} Roadworks.

::{{D|Event|The stoplight turns green. Cuts to the two walking but coming to a stop when a group of children run their way, blocking them, they both sigh and wait impatiently for several moments, though eventually notice the same children have been running around them repetitively}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Wait a minute!

::{{D|Event|The camera pans out to show the children running around the two in a circle}}

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: What are you doing?

:{{D|Child}}: Playing tag!

::{{D|Event|The children break the loop and start running on the sidewalk before all bumping one by one into a fence. Hot Dog Guy and Gumball take different sidewalks, parting from each other}}

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: Finally! Alone.

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Sighs}} I thought I'd never get rid of that guy.

:{{D|Both}}: Hopefully I'll never see his face—

::{{D|Event|They accidentally meet as they come to a bus stop. They both look surprised and sigh; there is a long, awkward silence as they wait for the bus}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Really?

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: I'll just, uh...

:{{D|Gumball}}: Yes, y-yes, you do that.

::{{D|Event|Hot Dog Guy walks away. The bus arrives, stuffed with passengers}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Sighs}}

::{{D|Event|Gumball tries to make his way through the bus, grunting, apologizing, and pushing a passenger out of the bus through a window in the process by pressure}}

::{{D|Event|Scene cuts to Hot Dog Guy's bus stop, the same bus arrives}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Breathing heavily, sweating}} Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot... {{D|Event|Starts blowing air in Hot Dog Guy's direction}}

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: Could you, uh, like, not breathe directly to my mouth?

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Stuttering}} I'm sorry, it's just really hot in here. I'll just try. {{D|Event|Blows air sideways}}

:{{D|Hank (construction man)}}: Hey. Hey!

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Blows air downwards, onto a shorter passenger}} Oh, sorry.

:{{D|Leonard Daniels}}: I don't mind.

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Monologue}} ''Okay, just go to your happy place.''

::{{D|Event|The scene transitions to Gumball floating in a clear blue sky}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Ah, that's better, but I need some more air. {{D|Event|Takes a deep breath}} Comfortable clothes please. 

::{{D|Event|Gumball is now wearing a long white cloth}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Still thirsty though.

::{{D|Event|Hot Dog Guy suddenly bumps into him out of nowhere}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Hey! This is my private happy place! What are you doing here?

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: Not really my choice.

::{{D|Event|Scene transitions back to the crammed bus; Gumball is back in his regular clothes}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: What the?! How?

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: Well, we hit a bump and, um...

::{{D|Event|The bus shakes, pushing Hot Dog Guy's head into Gumball's mouth. Gumball presses the stop button repetitively in panic while his mouth is still on Hot Dog Guy's head}}

::{{D|Event|Scene cuts to Elmore Shopping. The bus drops off Gumball and Hot Dog Guy in a forced manner. The duo both get to their feet}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Okay, look, we're clearly walking in the same direction. Let's just acknowledge that and move forward.

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: Yeah, it's only weird if we make it weird. Let's just relax and coexist, there's nothing weird about that.

==Awkwardness Inside the Elevator==
::{{D|Event|Inside one of the buildings, both head towards an elevator and push the same button at the same time. They leap out and shriek, wiping their hands off}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Sighs}} Who am I kidding, the elevator is one of the most awkward places on the planet. Right up there with the school locker room, dinner with your girlfriend's father, dinner with your girlfriend's father in the school locker room.

::{{D|Event|The elevator doors open. The two walk inside, unnerved}}

::{{D|Event|After some nervous silence, Hot Dog Guy takes his phone out of his jacket. Gumball, slightly annoyed, imitates him and his phone's sounds. Hot Dog Guy turns to Gumball, wondering what the latter is doing. Gumball casually moves his hand to the back of his head and the other to his hip, pretending he didn't do anything. They both then quit their acts resignedly}}

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: So, where are you going anyway?

:{{D|Gumball}}: Oh, I was just getting ketchup for my delicious hot do— uh... did you press the button?

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: You're standing next to it, I thought you pressed it.

::{{D|Event|In slow-motion, they're both about to press the same button}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Slow-motion}} Not ''this'' time! {{D|Event|Withdraws his hand, changing its direction}} Ha ha ha! {{D|Event|Continues laughing as his finger accidentally derails into his eye, and his laughing becomes a long yelp of pain}}

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: {{D|Event|Normally}} What is wrong with you, man?

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Pulls finger out of eye; normally}} Nothing.

::{{D|Event|Gumball glances towards the panel, which is showing the elevator moving at decimal numbers}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Come on! Come on! 

::{{D|Event|Gumball presses the button repetitively, and the elevator stops abruptly}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Sighs}} Right. With our luck, we'll be stuck here for two days. How about we just push through the awkwardness and get to know each other.

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: How?

:{{D|Gumball}}: Let's just confess to our most embarrassing secret, right here, right now. Then we'll know each other so well, we'll feel comfortable enough to hang out.

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: Eh, really?

:{{D|Gumball}}: I'll start! I've got like a weird nail at the end of my tail. Look. {{D|Event|Moves the fur on the end of his tail to reveal the end of a finger on his tail}}

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: {{D|Event|Pulling back in horror}} Ew...

:{{D|Gumball}}: Come on man, don't leave me hanging.

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: {{D|Event|Sighs}} Okay. This isn't my real hair. It's a wig. Designed to hide this: {{D|Event|Takes off his wig to reveal a scar on his head}} I was born attached to my two brothers. The other scars are less conspicuous.

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Snickers}}

::{{D|Event|The elevator doors open suddenly}}

:{{D|Both}}: {{D|Event|Gasp}}

:{{D|Tobias}}​​​​​: {{D|Event|Holding up both a phone and his other hand}} Don't worry, I didn't take any pictures.

:{{D|Both}}: {{D|Event|Sigh}}

:{{D|Tobias}}​​​​​: {{D|Event|Chuckles}} It was a video!

::{{D|Event|Both glare at Tobias}}

==Awkwardness in a Public Restroom==

::{{D|Event|Gumball runs to the boys' restroom in a cubicle, tired}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Finally.​ A some place where I—

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: {{D|Event|Busts inside the same cubicle as Gumball's}} —won't reach that guy again!

:{{D|Gumball}}: Oh, come on! 

::{{D|Event|Gumball stomps his foot in anger, but ends up going inside the toilet}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Sighs emotionally}} Can you just open the door please? 

::{{D|Event|Hot Dog Guy attempts to open the door but fails}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: And we're stuck.

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: OK, the only way out of here is to work together.

:{{D|Gumball}}: You work together.

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: It's not possible to work together on your own.

:{{D|Gumball}}: Whatever.

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: Come on, you just have to go at the back at the cubicle and push out with our legs.

:{{D|Gumball}}: OK, give me your arm.

::{{D|Event|They put their arms together}}

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: We touch as little as possible again, okay?

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Disgusted}} Why do you have to make everything so awkward?

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: Me?

::{{D|Event|They start to walk up the wall}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: You're the one who's halflessly awkward!

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: I'm not halfless, I'm totally halfull man!

:{{D|Gumball}}: That's not even a word. Ok, how about if we pretend this is all normal?

::{{D|Event|Leonard Daniels stands in front of the cubicle where Gumball and Hot Dog Guy are}}

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: {{D|Event|Off-screen}} Ok, it's just a hot dog and a blue cat climbing on a public toilet using only your feet. Nothing weird here.

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Off-screen}} See, there's nothing awkward if you decide it's not.

:{{D|Leonard Daniels}}: I don't know, it sounds pretty awkward from here.

::{{D|Event|The door of the cubicle breaks and falls on Daniels with the boys on top of it}}

:{{D|Both}}: Sorry.

:{{D|Leonard Daniels}}: {{D|Event|Muffled voice}} I don't mind.

::{{D|Event|They leave the restroom awkwardly}}

==Supermarket Madness==
:{{D|Gumball}}: Haha, one day we'll laugh about... not about this but—

::{{D|Event|They both make an awkward face and walk away}}

::{{d|event|Scene cuts to the supermarket}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Rapping}}

:''Finally I got rid of that annoying Hot dog Guy.''

:''Now I'm in the store so there is no reason why.''

:''He can interrupt my day so I'll tell you all what's up''

:''And top of me and buy myself a bottle of ketch—''

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Screams; cans fall}} Hah, funny. That would be a perfect dramatic place for him to appear.

::{{D|Event|Gumball falls in line at the counter. A man with a Hot Dog Guy-like head is in line too and Gumball screams}}

:{{D|HotDogGuyLookalike}}​​​​​: You thought I was that Hot Dog Guy, right?

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Nods}}

:{{D|HotDogGuyLookalike}}​​​​​: Yeah, I get that a lot.

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Laughs}}

:{{D|Crocodile Woman}}: Hey, look. {{d|event|Hold two cans of hot dog}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Scream again}}

:{{D|Crocodile Woman}}: Buy one, get one free.

::{{D|Event|Marvin meows}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|Event|Laughs}} It's funny, you really do look like the Hot Do— 

::{{D|Event|Suddenly, Hot Dog Guy is next to him. He jumps}}

:{{D|Both}}: No, no, no! {{D|Event|Start running }}

:{{D|Gumball}}: What are you doing? I'm running away from you!

:{{D|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: No, I'm running away from you!

::{{d|event|Both of them run out of the store along with their shopping and the alarm starts beeping}}

:{{d|Billy}}: Look, Mother, larceny. {{d|event|Points to Hot Dog Guy and Gumball}}

::{{d|event|Hot Dog Guy throws the can he is holding}}

:{{d|Billy}}: Someone call securi— 

::{{d|event|The can Hot Dog Guy threw hits Billy's head, causing him to faint}}

::{{d|event|Gumball and Hot Dog Guy are still escaping from each other only to be stopped by the Hand Mall Cop}}

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: FREEZE!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Hot Dog Guy raise their hand, surrendering}}

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: Don't move a muscle.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Can we just move a little?

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: You're going nowhere! {{d|event|Puts handcuffs on Gumball's and Hot Dog Guy's hand}} Now let me read you your rights. You have the right to return any part within twenty days. You do not have to buy anything but anything you do buy. You have the right to redeem unlimited coupon. If you do not have a coupon, you may provide it by owner of the store. Do you understand!?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I understand that you not a real cop.

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: I'm a mall cop! Is that real enough for you?

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: No.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wait, if you not a real cop how can we have handcuffs?

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: They're available for 5 bucks in the toy store at the second floor.

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: Wait, are we officially under arrest or what?

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: Well, official is just a word.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, for things that are officially official. {{d|event|Looks at the Hot Dog Guy}} Shall we?

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: Definitely.

::{{d|event|Hot Dog Guy and Gumball run along with the handcuffs}}

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: Hey, stop!

::{{d|event|The Hand Mall Cop tries to chase Hot Dog Guy and Gumball so they hide in a grand piano's base}}

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: Quick! ''That'' way! {{d|event|Point his hand to the right side}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, I say we go ''that'' way! {{d|event|Point his hand to the left side}}

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: Why? That's where he went.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yea, I know, I just wanted to get you back.

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: {{d|event|Sees them}} Hey you!

::{{d|event|They quickly run to the right side while being chased by the cop}}

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: There! {{d|event|Drags Gumball along with him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, there! {{d|event|Drags Hot Dog Guy to the elevator but the elevator's door closes as Gumball goes in}}

::{{d|event|Hot Dog Guy tries to pull Gumball out of the elevator and succeeds, though flattening Gumball in the process}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Tries and fails to pull out the handcuffs}} Right, the one bit I'd like to be flat isn't. {{d|event|Inflates himself to normal}}

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: Hey! {{d|event|Comes out of the elevator and runs after them}}

::{{d|event|Both of them stop as they reach the mall balcony railings and switch their side while Hand Mall Cop stands in front of them}}

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: You two are going down!

::{{d|event|Gumball turns around and notices a string pennant of flags leading to the bottom floor of the mall}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yes, that's it!

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: No!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} Trust me.

::{{d|event|Hot Dog Guy and Gumball slide down the string pennant using the chains on their handcuffs, screaming. They land safely}}

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: I meant the escalator's right there.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh. Oh, right sorry.

::{{d|event|The two boredly slide back up the string pennant and run back down the escalators. They make a break for the exit, but it is blocked by Hand Mall Cop}}

:{{d|Hand Mall Cop}}: Stop right there!

::{{d|event|Hot Dog Guy and Gumball run into him, with the chains on their handcuffs knocking him out. They shriek in terror and slowly approach him}}

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: Hey, mister, are you okay?

:{{d|event|Hand Mall Cop does not respond}}

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​​: Sir? Sir!

::{{d|event|Still no response. Hot Dog Guy and Gumball look at each other, unimpressed}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Officer?

::{{d|event|Hand Mall Cop does a brief salute before passing out again. Hot Dog Guy and Gumball sigh in relief, steal his keys to undo their handcuffs, and run out. Gumball quickly runs back in and places money on the cop's chest to pay for the stolen ketchup. He pauses, looks at the ketchup, takes the money back, and throws some spare change at the cop, then leaves}}

==Crisis Averted==
::{{d|event|Hot Dog Guy and Gumball stand outside the mall}}

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}​​​​: {{d|event|Sighs}} Well.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah. Heh. That was weird. Uh, but we made it! High fi-

::{{d|event|Hot Dog Guy walks off before Gumball can finish his sentence. Leonard Daniels suddenly walks out of the mall, misinterpreting Gumball's raised hand as a wave}}

:{{d|Leonard Daniels}}: Oh, hello!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh! No, no. I-I wasn't saying hello. Uh, t-to you.

:{{d|Leonard Daniels}}: Oh, oh sorry.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Daniels begin leaving, walking in the same direction}}

:{{d|Leonard Daniels}}: Oh, we're walking in the same direction, heh. Awkward!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm sorry.

:{{d|Leonard Daniels}}: For what?

:{{d|Gumball}}: For this.

::{{d|event|Gumball picks Daniels up and tosses him in the trash can. He walks off}}

:{{d|Leonard Daniels}}: I don't mind.

::{{d|event|The episode ends}}
