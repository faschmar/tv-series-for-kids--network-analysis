==You're Being Bullied==
::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Richard are sitting on the couch watching a thumbwrestling game on TV. Anais turns around and notices Gumball with lasagna all over his face}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Huh? Are you okay?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yep! School was awesome! 

::{{d|event|Flashback shows Tina holding Gumball upside down, shaking out his spare change}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Voice-over}} I was hanging out with Tina! She taught me how to donate to charity.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Who is this for, again?

:{{d|Tina}}: Me!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Voice-over}} Then, she helped me "tear" through my homework. 

::{{d|event|Flashback shows Tina tearing Gumball's homework, and an "F" pops up on it}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Voice-over}} And finally, we had lunch together!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hmmm, what should I try first? 

::{{d|event|Tina pushes Gumball's face into the lasagna}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mmmm! Lasagna! 

::{{d|event|Flashback ends}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: It was great! 

::{{d|event|Anais stares disapprovingly at Gumball}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: What?

:{{d|Anais}}: I think you're being bullied.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Nah, we're just having fun.

:{{d|Anais}}: Hmmm... Nope, you're definitely getting bullied.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ah! What am I gonna do?

:{{d|Anais}}: Don't worry, bro, I'll take care of this for you. {{d|event|Pulls out a large cell phone, and calls Tina}} Hey, Tina, you've been picking on my brother, and I think it's time you guys talk about this face to face!

::{{d|event|Tina roaring can be heard over the phone}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Tomorrow?

:{{d|Tina}}: {{d|event|Roars}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Four P.M.?!

:{{d|Tina}}: {{d|event|Roars}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Behind the school?! 

:{{d|Tina}}: {{d|event|Roars}}

:{{d|Anais}}: No, wait, that's not what I meant! {{d|event|Phone buzzes}} Oopsies!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well?

:{{d|Anais}}: It looks like your face to face turned into more of a... face to fist...

:{{d|Gumball}}: What the... what?!

:{{d|Anais}}: I think she wants to have a fight with you...

::{{d|event|Wrestling bell rings}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Come on, son, it's time I showed you how to deal with bullies.

==The Bunny Hop==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Richard are at the backyard}}

:{{d|Richard}}: There's a day in every man's life where he has to stand up for himself! But that's okay, 'cause daddy's here to teach you an old technique that got me out of trouble many times.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Shining eyes}} Ooooh, a secret fighting technique?

:{{d|Richard}}: Yes, it's called... The Bunny Hop! {{d|event|Wrestling bell rings again}} But remember, you must never use it in anger!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I promise, father.

:{{d|Richard}}: Alright, you be the bully.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay.

:{{d|Richard}}: Come on, don't be shy, go on and take my lunch money! 

::{{d|event|Gumball makes a tiny step and meows, Richard freaks out}} 

:{{d|Richard}}: DON'T HURT ME, DON'T HURT MY FACE, HERE'S MY LUNCH MONEY, AND MY LUNCH, PLEASE TAKE IT, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! That was step one, and here comes the Bunny Hop! 

::{{d|event|Richard freaks out again, jumps around, and hits the fence; Darwin and Anais came to see what happened}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, that wasn't much help.

:{{d|Anais}}: You're right, I think you need help from a real adult.

==Mr. Small's Office==
:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​: School counselor, pretty scary title, huh? But don't you worry, think of me as a friend, a compadre, a fellow pilgrim, on a mad journey we call... life! So tell me, what's shaking?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, I'm fine! {{d|event|Smiles}}

:{{d|Anais}}: No, he's not! He's being bullied!

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​: Oh, the big "B..." You know, more often than not, conversation beats confrontation. Hands down, let's meditate on this.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Mr. Small}}​​​: Ommmmm... Ommmmmm...

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​: So tell me, who's bullying you?

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Anais}}: Tina Rex.

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​​​​: TINA REX?! 

::{{d|event|All of Mr. Small's colors drip of his body, and he throws Gumball and Anais out of his office}} 

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​​​​: Don't tell her you saw me! {{d|event|Closes the door's blinds}}

==Viva la Revolution==
:{{d|Anais}}: Well, that wasn't much help.

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​: No way! Gumball's gonna fight Tina?

:{{d|Idaho}}: She's gonna mash him!

:{{d|Anton}}: He's toast!

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: She's gonna skin him alive!

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​: This will be the greatest fight eveeer!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} This is getting out of hand.

:{{d|Anais}}: Don't worry, I'll fix this. {{d|event|To everybody}} Come on, what is wrong with you, guys? How many of you've being bullied by Tina? 

::{{d|event|Gumball's schoolmates mumble confused and raise their hands}} 

:{{d|Anais}}: Don't you realize we could all join forces and we can stand up to Tina once and for all? 

::{{d|event|Gumball's classmates mumble again, cheery music starts playing in the background}}

:{{d|Anais}}: And no student will ever be bullied again!

:{{d|Everybody}}: Yeah!

:{{d|Anais}}: And also stop global warming!

:{{d|Everybody}}: Yeah!

:{{d|Anais}}: And bring peace to the world!

:{{d|Everybody}}: Yeah!

:{{d|Anais}}: And build schools for the dolphins and the rain forests so they can cure baldness!

:{{d|Everybody}}: Yeah!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh, Anais?

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Rob carries her away}} Sorry Gumball, the power's gone to my head! See you on Capitol Hill!

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: {{d|event|Speaks quickly}} Good luck with the fight, man! {{d|event|Laughs and runs away}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: There you are!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Screams}} Darwin! You're supposed to be here when your best friend's about to get mangled by— {{d|event|Darwin covers his mouth}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Shhh! Just follow me!

==Protecting Armor==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are in the gym. Darwin then turns the lights on, revealing an armor made of cardboard and metal}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Behold, the Super Bully Protecting Suit of {{d|event|Echoes}} ''Power!''

:{{d|Gumball}}: WHOAAAAH! {{d|event|The arm on the suit falls off}} I LOVE IT!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Puts the suit on Gumball, buzzes}} Lookin' good. Now check this out! It's got bouncing bubble wrap pants and has an MP3 player as standard! 

::{{d|event|Darwin turns the MP3 player on, and they starts dancing}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: And that's not all: this string here operates the Super Counter Attack Device. 

::{{d|event|Gumball tries to use it}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: No, wait! You only got one shot, so you must wait for the right moment.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay.

:{{d|Darwin}}: And last, but not least: the tassels!

:{{d|Gumball}}: What do these do?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Move your arm around. 

::{{d|event|Gumball does so}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Oooooh, tassels!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Okay, time to put it to the test! Ready?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay!

::{{d|event|Darwin repeatedly hits Gumball with a hockey stick as Gumball screams in pain}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Can you feel anything yet? {{d|event|Hits Gumball Again}}

::{{d|event|Gumball screams in pain}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Okay, I'll keep going!

::{{d|event|Gumball tries to stop Darwin, who finally stops. Gumball pulls the "Super Counter Attack Device," it's confetti}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What did it feel like?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Muffled}} Like I'm being hit with a stick!

:{{d|Darwin}}: What?

::{{d|event|Gumball takes off the helmet of the suit, he has swolen eyes, bumps on his head and missing teeth}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Like I'm being hit with a stick! {{d|event|Throws the helmet away}} That wasn't much help...

:{{d|Darwin}}: That's okay! We could rebuild it, better, faster, stronger! Let's get to work!

::{{d|event|Ring bell sounds}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh! Too late.

:{{d|Gumball}}: You know what? Maybe it won't be so bad. I'll just meet Tina in quite calmed atmosphere and talk things like civilized people.

:{{d|gumball}} and {{d|darwin}}: Yeah!

:{{d|gumball}}: This is a great idea!

==The Confrontation==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are at the schoolyard in the middle of a crowd that are cheering Gumball by chanting "Fight"}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: This, is a terrible idea.

::{{d|event|The crowd keeps chanting "Fight", until Miss Simian interrupts}}

:{{d|Simian}}: What's going on here? 

::{{d|event|Everyone stops and looks at her}} 

:{{d|Simian}}: I'll have no fighting on my watch. Oh, Gumball Watterson. I might have known!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ahh, thank you Miss Simian! Uhh, I was gonna fight a T-Rex. Please, send me to detention!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Well, I suppose I could... after my coffee break!

:{{d|Gumball}}: But Miss Simian! Tina's gonna—

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Emmm! Coffee. Break? {{d|event|Slurps on coffee and walks away}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: But Miss Simian, you're my last hope! Please! {{d|event|Cries}}

::{{d|event|Gumball's classmates resume to chanting "Fight." Tina then stomps onto the schoolyard from behind a corner}}

:{{d|Masami}}: Uh-oh. 

::{{d|event|Gumball gulps}}

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: Where's Gumball?

:{{d|Students}}: {{d|event|Point at Gumball}} Here! 

::{{d|event|Everyone runs away}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Frightened}} What am I gonna do, what am I gonna do?!

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Echoed}} Use The Bunny Hop, son. Son. Son. {{d|event|Back to normal}} Son. Son. Son.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dad? What are you doing here?

:{{d|Richard}}: Well, I wasn't gonna miss the big fight!

::{{d|event|Tina roars and both Gumball and Richard are terrified}}

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: {{d|event|Runs after Gumball}} Gumball!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Alright! Time to deal with this like a man!

==The Fight==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the school hall, where Gumball is doing The Bunny Hop, while Tina chases after him, and roars, and then Gumball runs through doors and on lockers, followed by Tina smashing through the doors and bumping her head into the same lockers}}

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: Gumball, STOP RUNNING!

:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Beatboxing}}

:{{d|Rocky Robinson}}: Dude, I've no idea what you're saying.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Cuts across Juke and Rocky}} Sorry!

::{{d|event|Gumball uses a tray to slide through the canteen while Tina is still chasing him. Gumball screams and runs into the school swimming pool. An octopus is  swimming inside the pool as Tina chases Gumball, and it squirts colorful ink. Gumball then comes out of the pool and runs away}}

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: {{d|event|Comes out of the pool}} Gumball!

::{{d|event|Gumball runs into the girls' room, causing the girls to scream in terror, so he quickly runs out of there}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry! {{d|event|Sees Tina still chasing him}} Oh man.

::{{d|event|Gumball then runs back into the girls' restroom while the girls throw objects at him. Gumball climbs out of the window and Tina smashes her way out of the room, roaring. Gumball then enter another part of the hall and then use random items to block the door and runs away. Tina, however, smashes through the door and continues to chase after Gumball}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Ha ha, scaredycat!

::{{d|event|Gumball stops at Banana Joe, peels off his skin, and throws it at Tina. She slips on it and slides down the hall. Gumball runs away while Banana Joe laughs at her, and then covers his naked self}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mr. Small! Please... let me in!

:{{d|Tina}}: {{d|event|Roars twice}}

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​​​: TINA! NO!

:{{d|Gumball}}: PLEASE! LET ME IN!

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​​​: NO!

:{{d|Gumball}}: MR. SMALL!

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​​​: GO AWAY!

::{{d|event|Gumball rushes to the door of Mr. Small's door. However the door is closed and Gumball's face hits the door as the scene goes black}}

==Mom to the Rescue==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the Wattersons' dining room, where the whole family stares at Gumball during dinner. Gumball is then seen wearing sunglasses while having dinner}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Would you mind removing your glasses when you're at the table?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Err... yes? {{d|event|Swallows food}}

::{{d|event|Nicole sighs and removes Gumball's sunglasses, revealing that he has got a black eye}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} What happened to you?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I... ran into a door? {{d|event|Smiles sheepishly}}

:{{d|Anais}}: That's not true, he's being bullied!

::{{d|event|The whole family stares at him. Scene then changes to the highway where Nicole is driving along with Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Seriously, I ''did'' run into a door!

::{{d|event|Nicole stares at him angrily and accelerates her car. Scene then changes to the junkyard, where Tina lives. Nicole then stomps up to her house}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Chases after Nicole}} Mom, calm down!

:{{d|Nicole}}: I'M PERFECTLY CALM! {{d|e|Calmly}} I just need a word with Mr. Rex, Honeypie.

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: Gumball!

::{{d|event|Gumball gasps and Nicole stares in anger. Tina then rushes to Gumball}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: SIT!

::{{d|event|Tina stops and sits down}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: You guys, make up!

::{{d|event|Nicole then opens up the doors of Mr. Rex's house}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Mr. Rex.

::{{d|event|Mr. Rex stares at Nicole}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Hi Mr. Rex. We need to talk about your daughter.

::{{d|event|Mr. Rex roars at Nicole}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: So it's gonna be like ''that'', is it? {{d|event|Pushes up her sleeves and stomps into Mr. Rex's house}} Well, that's fine by me! {{d|event|Slams the door shut}}

::{{d|event|Scene changes to where Gumball and Tina are making up}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Your dad is pretty scary.

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: So is your mom.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Err, Tina, is it true that you're bullying me?

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: What? No! I thought we were just having fun.

:{{d|Gumball}}: So, why were you chasing me?

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: I only wanted to speak to you, but you ran away.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Mr. Rex's house as it is being thrashed by Nicole. Scene quickly changes back to where Gumball and Tina is}}

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: Everyone thinks I'm a brute... just like my dad. BUT I'M NOT! {{d|event|Kicks scrap car away}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I don't think you are a brute!

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: Really?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Of course! You're just a dangerous friend with a terrifying amount of strength.

:{{d|Tina Rex}}: Thanks!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on, gimme five! {{d|event|Sees Tina's small arms}} Oh. Err, how about a friend hug? 

::{{d|event|Tina hugs and crushes Gumball}}

::{{d|event|Scene changes back at Mr. Rex's house, completely thrashed by Nicole}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Stomps out of Mr. Rex's house}} Well, I'm glad we've finally reached to an agreement. Goodbye Mr. Rex.
