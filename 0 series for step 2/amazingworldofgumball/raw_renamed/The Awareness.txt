==What Is the Theme?==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin grab their backpacks and are about to go to school}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Wait, isn't there some kind of theme at school this week?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Argh, I hate all these theme weeks! Cake week, cake crumb cleanup week, ant week, how do we get rid of ants week, anteaters week, how do we get rid of anteaters week. What is it this week?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Technology week?

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, that was three weeks ago.

::{{d|event|Flashback to three weeks ago. Gumball and Darwin are standing in the hallway with Bobert, dressed up like robots}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Happy technology week, Bobert! Hey, who's your little friend?

:{{d|Bobert}}: That is a vacuum cleaner. Do you assume all machines know each other?

::{{d|event|Gumball tries to say something to defend himself against Bobert's sound argument, but he cannot. He and Darwin silently walk away toward a flight of stairs}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, Technology week, remember?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah-huh.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin move like robots. Darwin moves his cardboard robot body but gets exhausted after only four tiny steps.  Gumball barely makes it up to the second step of the stairs before he falls onto his back with his arms and legs still moving, like a robot}}

:{{d|Bobert}}: Not helping.

::{{D|event|The flashback ends}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, we haven't done history week!

:{{d|Darwin}}: No, ''you'' haven't done history week.

::{{d|event|Flashback to history week. Darwin is walking down the hall and sees Gumball dressed up like a panda}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Why are you dressed as a panda? It's history week. Endangered species week was last week.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Exactly. I'm dressed up as last week, that's history, right? Anyway, surely pandas are history by now.

:{{d|Darwin}}: You just forgot, didn't you?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yup.

::{{D|event|The flashback ends}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Okay, we're definitely going to mess this up again! We don't even know what the theme is!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry, I've got this.

==Green Week==
:{{d|Darwin}}: I'm not sure about this.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are wearing multiple parts of different themed costumes}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ah, come on. Chill. We've got all the bases covered.

::{{d|event|The bus comes to a stop, and Gumball and Darwin board it}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Huh?

::{{d|event|The students already on the bus are wearing several environmentally-themed constumes}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, it's green week.

:{{d|Rocky}}: Yeah! I even filled up the bus with cod liver oil instead of gas!

::{{d|event|The bus suddenly breaks down and comes to a stop}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Wait, it's sunflower oil that works in engines. Well, looks like you're walking to school. And it was so difficult squeezing all those fish into the gas tank. {{d|event|Sniffs his hand and gags}}

::{{d|event|All the students are seen walking on the sidewalk to reach school}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Sarah, great detail! Even your ice caps are melting.

:{{d|Sarah}}: Actually, it's just a hot day, but thanks for pointing it out, Darwin.

::{{d|event|Sarah scrapes off some of her globe face-painting making it look like it's really melting. Gumball and Darwin see a tired Tobias with a green gradient over him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Whoa! Love the green rainbow, Tobias!

:{{d|Tobias}}​​: It's not a costume... I think I have food poisoning— {{d|event|Vomits}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Disgusted}} Ugh!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey, Bobert! Thank goodness. Glad we're not the only ones who've done nothing for Green Week—

::{{d|event|Bobert looks like he's been shut down}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Bobert? {{d|event|Inspects his face}} Installing updates?

:{{d|Teri}}: Actually, Bobert is taking part. He turns himself off every night. Unfortunately it takes him ninety minutes to reboot.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh. We are the only ones then.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ah, well, it's only Green Week. I mean there's nothing special about plants. Think about it. Superheroes are all named after animals and insects for a reason. {{D|event|He impersonates a narrator with heroic music in the background}} The city's been invaded by evil alien robots, but fear not, Tree Man will save us! {{D|event|Normally}} By silently standing in a field with nothing but the power of going bald annually.

:{{d|Sarah}}: {{d|event|Gasps and takes out her notebook}} I can already see the merch!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yup, plants are pointless.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​: Eh-hem! I'm a plant! I think we're pretty important!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Leslie! Yeah, m-me too! Plants do loads of important things!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​: Really? Name one.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Only one? But there's so many!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​: Okay, then give me five.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Let's just start with one, shall we?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​: Okay, then give me ''one.''

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uuuuuuhhhhh....... salad!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Unimpressed}} Salad?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah...... yeah, this whole thing is coming out wrong! Lettuce-I mean ''let us'' forget about it! It's clearly thorny issue. Thorny!? Uhh, we should just nip it in the bud.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​​​: No, let's not! That phrase is actually incredibly offensive to plants! Hmph! {{d|event|Storms off in a huff}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Leslie, wait! Let me explain!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​​​: Okay.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ah, sorry, I got nothin'. I didn't think you'd actually turn around.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​​​: Hmph! {{d|event|Walks off}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: You wanna do it, or shall I?

:{{d|Gumball}}: You do it.

::{{d|event|Darwin shoves Gumball's feet into his mouth}}

==Some Research on Plants==
::{{d|event|Elmore Junior High, in the hallway}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I can't believe Leslie thinks I don't care about plants!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Well, do you?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah! I care loads! What about the, you know, big thing? The big green thing?

:{{d|Darwin}}: The woods?

:{{d|Gumball}}: No no, the other one. Bigger. The wet one.

:{{d|Darwin}}: The rainforest?

:{{d|Gumball}}: The rainforest! Yeah, the rainforest.

:{{d|Darwin}}: What about the rainforest?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, isn't it that there's too much of it? {{d|event|Pause}} Or....not enough?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Which one?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Too much?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Wrong. If you wanna get Leslie to forgive you, you're going to have to do a ''whole'' lot of research.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh yeah. Absolutely. I mean, that's very important, of course. {{d|event|Pause}} About what?

:{{d|Darwin}}: PLANTS!

::{{d|event|At the school library. Gumball approaches the librarian, who is turned around at her desk.}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Excuse me, I'm—

:{{d|Tree Librarian}}: Computers one, three, and four work. Please surf responsibly.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Actually, I'm here for some books.

:{{d|Tree Librarian}}: {{d|event|Whips around and drops her book}} WHAT??!! Shh! Quiet! Sorry, I'm just excited! Kids only come here for the computers!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, no, I wanna learn about the history of plant culture!

:{{d|Tree Librarian}}: Ah, you're in luck! I'm doing a lecture on plant history soon, and—

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ooooh, sorry, I'm... busy that day.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{D|event|Whispering}} She didn't say when it was.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Could I just have the notes? 

::{{d|event|The librarian reaches behind her and slams a huge stack of papers onto her desk}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Do the notes have notes? 

::{{d|event|She reaches behind her again and slams another huge stack onto her desk}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Could you just summarize it for me?

:{{d|Tree Librarian}}: You want me to summarize the entirety of plant culture and history?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah! Preferably in one word.

:{{d|Tree Librarian}}: Photosynthesis.

:{{d|Gumball}}: One that I know?

:{{d|Tree Librarian}}: Out!

::{{d|event|Back in the hallway}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, I did learn one thing: the word photosynthesis. It's my way in!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Do you even know what it means?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Blows raspberry}} That's not the point. Like, why would you bother learning Australian when you can just wear the hat with the dangly cords and skip right to the good stuff?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Is Australian a language?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hm. I guess we'll never know. Anyway, I'm gonna go talk to Leslie about sotophynthesis before I forget how to say it.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Photosynthesis.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yep! Photosynthe-see you later! {{d|event|Runs off}}

==An Amazing Photosynthesis Session==
::{{d|event|In the courtyard, Leslie is reading while Gumball walks in front of him, talking on his phone}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, yeah, totally. It was an amazing photosynthesis session. {{d|event|This catches Leslie's attention}} You shoulda seen me, everyone was like, slow down, you're doin' it too hard, but I was like, nah, I'm in the zone! Yeah. Cool. Speak to you later, Darwin. {{d|event|His phone beeps}}

:{{d|Phone}}: Calling Darwin.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Frantically hangs up}} Oh hey, Leslie! How's it growin', my man?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: So, you've been photosynthesizing? Isn't that more of a plant thing?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Stretching}} Yeah, but I just respect the plant culture so much I got into it, you know?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: Really?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, I've already done, like ppphhh, eight hours today.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: But the sun wasn't up eight hours ago.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mmh. I got a method.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: Well, I was about to do some now, do you wanna join me?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Cool, yeah, count me in! I might just do mine in the shade, though.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: Hah! Nice one. {{d|event|Gets off the bench}} Right. Let's face the sun full-on so we can really get into it!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh. Yeah, of course. It's gotta be in direct sunlight, I was just kidding. That was a joke I got from....uh, Photosynthesis Weekly! MONTHLY!!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: Oh, you read PM too? What did you think of the latest issue? Controversial, right?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I think... everything that can be said about it has been said!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Whispers}} You're so right. Well, let's settle in, then. {{d|event|Gets into position}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Cool, cool. {{d|event|Awkwardly copies Leslie's position}}

::{{d|event|Later, Leslie is happily photosynthesizing while Gumball is completely dehydrated}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aaahh! Gotta love that heat, right?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: Ho-ho, you wait till it really kicks in at noon!

::{{d|event|Noon. The sun is blistering. Gumball is even more dried out than before, while Leslie still photosynthesizes peacefully}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: How long have we got now?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: 'Bout three minutes.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hooooo!! Have you got any water?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: Sure! You gotta have water for the session, right? 

::{{d|event|Leslie takes a water bottle from his backpack and hands it to Gumball, who starts to drink from it}} 

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: What are you doing? Plants drink like this! {{d|event|Pours some water into his roots}} Ahhh. Allow me. {{d|event|Smugly pours the rest of the water at Gumball's feet}} Drink up!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aaaaahhhhh!!

::{{d|event|The bell rings}}

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: I've gotta go. But a guy your size, you're gonna wanna stay out here for at least another couple of hours, right? 

::{{d|event|Gumball responds with a dehydrated scream}} 

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​: Oh-okay, time for me to ''leaf!'' {{d|event|Leans in and whispers}} That's a plant joke, since I know you love plants so much. Ciao! {{d|event|Walks off}}

::{{d|event|Suddenly, two blue arms rip out from underneath Gumball's dried-up skin. A newly shed Gumball tears out, completely naked, and curls up on the ground, shivering in fear. As ominous music plays, Banana Joe, in the background, sees this, and his eyes go wide in terror. Cut to him pulling the same expression on the bus and then in the shower, still holding his ice cream which gradually melts}}

:{{d|banana barbara}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Joe, honey! Dinner's ready!

::{{d|event|Joe is still traumatized at the dinner table. His mom serves him dinner}}

:{{d|banana barbara}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Did you have a nice day at school?

:{{d|banana joe}}: No. No, I did not.

==Drawing a Line Under It==
::{{d|event|Meanwhile, in Gumball and Darwin's bedroom, with the camera outside of the house}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} It was just totally uncalled for! Right?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Yes.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} And you're ''sure'' only plants can photosynthesize?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} {{d|event|Sighs}} Yes.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} So he obviously knew, and he didn't tell me! He took it too far, right?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Yes! 

::{{d|event|The camera cuts inside the bedroom. Darwin turns on the light, with his eyes being red and baggy}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Can we please just go to sleep?

::{{d|event|Gumball is sitting in an ice bath inside Darwin's fishbowl, bright red and steaming}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry. It's hard to get comfortable when even your teeth have third-degree sunburns.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Look, you upset him and he got you back. Maybe you should just draw a line under it.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, I'm going to draw a line under it alright.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Good. {{d|event|Turns off light, then turns it back on}} I feel like we're on different pages here.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Mumbling}} No, no, draw a line under it, I get it, I understand. TO EMPHASIZE IT!!!

::{{d|event|Darwin turns the light off and sighs, defeated}}

==It's a Plant Thing==

::{{d|event|Lunchtime in the cafeteria. Leslie is drinking from an orange juice carton, and Gumball approaches him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mind if I join you? {{d|event|Grinning evilly}} ''BUDDY?''

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​​: Don't you usually have lunch with Darwin?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, he had other plans, something to do with me going too far, people getting hurt, that sort of thing.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: So you're not eating?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Grinning evilly}} Oh, sure I am. I thought I thought I'd try some nice, fresh soil for lunch. {{d|event|Sets a bucket full of soil on the table}} 'Cuz that's what plants eat, right?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Glares in suspicion}} Oh, absolutely. We eat soil all the time.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Great. 'Cause I brought enough for two. {{d|event|Takes out another bucket of soil and pushes it towards Leslie}}

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Shoves it away}} Yeah. Actually, I've already eaten lunch.

:{{d|Gumball}}: No you haven't. I've been watching you for the last three hours and I'm absolutely sure you haven't had lunch. So tuck in.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: Heh... {{d|event|He scoops a spoonful of soil and lifts it to his mouth. Gumball is about to do the same, but then sets his spoon down}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Unless this ''isn't'' a plant thing.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Nervously}} No, no! It's a plant thing! 

::{{d|event|Leslie tentatively puts the dirt into his mouth. Gumball does the same. They both chew disgustedly, but don't swallow}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Muffled}} Clumpy!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Muffled}} Well, you know what else is a plant thing?

::{{d|event|Cut to the two on the street next to a fire truck. Leslie is turning on the hose, with Gumball in its trajectory}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: And you're sure this is a plant thing?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: 'Course! We get watered every day!

:{{d|Gumball}}: But does the pressure have to be so high?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: Probably.

::{{d|event|Leslie grabs the hose as the water comes on, and a massive jet of water shoots Gumball across the street and up a waterslide Tobias is about to ride. He falls off the slide}}

:{{d|rocky}}: Dude! One at a time!

::{{d|event|The Doughnut Sheriff and two french fry cops are examining a crime scene by the road}}

:{{d|doughnut sheriff}}: Luckily, all the evidence has been preserved, so this should be an open-and-check case. {{d|event|Gumball on the jet of water hurtles by, taking the evidence with him}} And that's lunch.

::{{d|event|The Melted Cheese Guy is finishing a marathon, but is exhausted and can't go on}}

:{{d|Melted Cheese Guy}}: Ah, it's gonna take a miracle for me to finish this race! 

::{{d|event|He notices Gumball zooming towards him and gladly readies himself for impact, but the water jet misses him}} 

:{{d|Melted Cheese Guy}}: Ah, to heck with this. {{d|event|Slaps his bib on Pantsbully, who starts running}}

::{{d|event|The scene cuts to Gumball opening of a box full of bees, releasing them into the classroom from the outside of the window}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Naw, it's a plant thing!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Off-screen}} But aren't they dangerous?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Eh, it's fine as long as you don't aggravate them. After all, ''bees are just overweight wasps!''

::{{d|event|Gumball closes the window, puts sunglasses on leaves Leslie in the classroom, freaking out as the bees swarm his face}}

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Ahh! Aaah! Oh! AAAAHH!!!

::{{d|event|Leslie; covered in bee stings throws bird seed at Gumball to attract woodpeckers to peck at him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't tell me. Plant thing?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|With a lisp}} Guess so.

::{{d|event|Leslie is chained to the bottom of the lake while Gumball wear scuba gear. Both of them talk, making bubbles. The bubbles reach the surface and pop, revealing what they said}}

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​: {{d|event|Bubble pops}} Plant thing?

:{{d|Gumball}}​​​​​​: {{d|event|Bubble pops}} Yeah.

::{{d|event|Finally, Gumball and a evil grinning Leslie are shown skydiving without parachutes}}

:{{d|Gumball}}​: AAH! OKAY! I GIVE IN! I might not know anything about plants, but skydiving without a parachute is definitely ''NOT ''A PLANT THING!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​​​​: Aha! So you admit it! You DON'T know anything about plants!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aha! So YOU admit that you were aware I didn't know anything about plants when you put me through all that stuff!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: Aha! Then if you were aware that I knew that you knew that I was aware, why didn't you say anything?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aha! Uh—no! Wait! I didn't follow any of that. Look, we'd better call a truce before this escalates any further!

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: ''Weed''? Is that another plant joke?

:{{d|Gumball}}: What? No! {{d|event|Sighs}} Leslie, I'm sorry I called plants pointless.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: And I'm sorry I made you stand waist-deep in fresh manure!

::{{d|event|They embrace in a warm hug}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Friends?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: 'Till the end!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Looks down}} Which, judging by the speed the ground is coming up, is in about five seconds.

::{{d|event|They scream and brace for impact, until they are pulled up like a parachute. Gumball looks up at Leslie, and we see he has transformed into a dandelion weed, significantly slowing down their fall}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wow. Where did that come from?

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: I don't know. Plant thing, I guess.

::{{d|event|They both land gracefully to the ground}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, thanks for teaching me something new.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​​​​​​: Yeah. I'm not really convinced you learned anything about plants, but I guess we better get out of here. I mean, you're gonna wanna go home and get milked, right?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Cool, cool. {{d|event|Stops in his tracks}} Wait, you think all mammals get—
