==Cleaning Under the Bed==
::{{d|event|The episode starts with an exterior view of the Watterson house}}

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Ugh, what's the point of cleaning under the bed? It's like cleaning a dumpster! It's ''designed'' to be filthy!

::{{d|event|The scene cuts to Gumball and Darwin's bedroom, with their mother rummaging under the bed}}

:{{d|nicole}}: Because this room {{d|event|grunts}} smells like dog burp! {{d|event|Pulls out a glass of milk}} Ugh! What is this?

:{{d|gumball}}: Oh, that's a glass of milk.

::{{d|event|Nicole turns the glass upside down, and the milk, which seems to be completely solid, starts sliding out extremely slowly}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Cheese. That's a glass of cheese.

::{{d|event|The milk falls through the floor and onto Richard, who had been eating a sandwich}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Aah! {{d|event|Groans}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Stone. That's a glass of stone.

:{{d|nicole}}: Are you kidding me?! That milk had to be at least ten years old.

:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Pulls out a moldy slice of pizza from under the bed}} Well, at least there's nothing alive under there.

::{{d|event|The pizza slice suddenly grows spider legs and squeals. Darwin screams and drops it, then it crawls out the open window}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Nicole}}: Eh. {{d|event|Shrug}}

::{{d|event|Gumball continues to search under the bed and pulls out a fish skeleton}}

:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} Darwin the First? So that's where you were hiding. Oh!

:{{d|darwin}}: Wait, I thought you said that Darwin the First left to live a happier life on a farm with other fishes.

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Laughs nervously}} He did... heh... He did...

::{{d|event|Nicole pulls out the board game ''Dodge or Dare'' from under the bed, albeit spelled "Dodj or Daar"}}

:{{d|nicole}}: Uhh... {{D|event|Nervously}} Hey, look what I found! The game you made!

:{{d|darwin}}: Hang on, I'm not three anymore, you're not going to distract me with-- What the what?

::{{D|event|The first of many huge noises tempting them to play the game suddenly sounds out. Nicole flicks Darwin the First's skeleton away while they are distracted}}

:{{d|darwin}}: ''Dodge or Dare''. It's calling us.

::{{d|event|Gumball pulls Darwin away, grabs the game and throws it into the garbage bag}}

:{{d|gumball}}: No! We swore we'd never play that game again.

==The Game Starting==
::{{d|event|The huge noise plays. Gumball and Darwin are in the kitchen, eating their lunch}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Just ignore the calls. {{d|event|Sips a cup of soda}}

::{{d|event|The huge noise plays twice. Darwin accidentally squirts too much ketchup, and Gumball's soda comes out of his nostrils. Again, he tries to eat a sandwich, but the huge noise causes him to force his hands in his mouth, which come out through his ears}}

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Nasally}} We have to destroy that game.

::{{d|event|Darwin and Gumball run to the garbage can and open it}}

:{{d|gumball}}: It's gone!

::{{d|event|The huge noise plays again. Gumball and Darwin run inside the house and find Anais, Nicole and Richard playing it}}
:{{d|gumball}} and {{d|darwin}}: Wait!

::{{D|event|The others then turn around, confused; the boys leap toward them}}

:{{D|Gumball}} and {{D|Darwin}}: {{d|e|In slow-motion}} Don't throw the dice!

::{{D|event|Richard throws the dice, and Gumball and Darwin fall to the ground}}

:{{d|gumball}}: You don't know what you're doing!

:{{d|richard}}: Yeah, 'cause you didn't write any instructions.

:{{d|anais}}: And what you did write was spelled wrong. ''Dodj or Daar''[sic]? Sounds like an alien choosing a baby name.

:{{d|richard}}: Let's just pack it away.

:{{d|gumball}}: No, you can't stop! Once you start ''Dodge or Dare'', {{D|event|Ominously}} it has to be finished!

==Playing the Game==
::{{d|event|The scene shows a front view of the Watterson house}}

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} {{d|event|Normal voice}} Okay, the rules are pretty simple. {{d|event|Gesturing toward the game board on-screen}} You roll the dice and pick a Dare card. If you do the Dare, then you go forward that many spaces. If you don't, then you have to take a Dodge card and move half the spaces.

:{{d|nicole}}: Okay, and how do you win?

:{{d|gumball}}: {{D|event|Ominously}} You don't win, you survive!

:{{d|nicole}}: Okay... but how ''do'' you actually win?

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Normal voice}} Oh, you have to roll an exact number to land on the last square. Dad, you're up.

:{{d|richard}}: {{d|event|Laughs}} I feel sorry for whoever's gonna do this one!

::{{d|event|Everybody looks at Richard, who realizes he has to do it and frowns. The scene cuts to the Doughnut Sheriff standing alongside a store chain}}

:{{d|richard}}: {{d|event|Runs to Doughnut Sheriff}} Officer, please, I need to report a theft.

:{{d|doughnut sheriff}}: Yes, finally! What did the thief look like?

:{{d|richard}}: Well, he was wearing a monocle.

::{{d|event|Doughnut Sheriff writes it down and sees Richard wearing a monocle}}

:{{d|doughnut sheriff}}: Okay... uh, anything else?

:{{d|richard}}: Yes. He had a big furry mustache!

::{{d|event|Doughnut Sheriff writes it down again, then he sees Richard wearing a big furry mustache}}

:{{d|doughnut sheriff}}: Okay... any other distinguishing features?

:{{d|richard}}: Yes, he was dressed as a yodeler! 

::{{d|event|Doughnut Sheriff continues to stare at him}} 

:{{d|Richard}}: Aren't you gonna write that down?

:{{d|doughnut sheriff}}: Just testing something.

::{{d|event|Doughnut Sheriff blinks for a split second, and Richard immediately is dressed in a suit of a yodeler}}

:{{d|doughnut sheriff}}: Yah! And what did that man steal?

:{{d|richard}}: A kiss.

==Prank Pizza==
::{{d|event|Back in the living room, Nicole and Anais laugh, while Richard rubs his black eye with a piece of meat}}

:{{d|anais}}: You actually did it? {{d|event|Giggles}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Oh, yeah. That's how it always starts, with the laughing and the Dares, and then later... {{d|event|Ominously}} the horror and fear!

::{{d|event|The ominous zoom-in to Gumball's face abruptly ends}}

:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} My go! 

::{{d|event|Nicole rolls the dice and takes a Dare card}} 

:{{d|nicole}}: Hmmm... order a prank pizza.

:{{d|larry}}: Uh, huh, and what's the address?

:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Laugh}} Four-twenty Grove Street. Oh, and can you add some turkey gizzards?

:{{d|larry}}: Along with the ice cream, pig's foot, and oysters?

:{{d|nicole}}: Yes, it's an old family recipe invented by my grandfather... {{d|event|Laughing}} Old Joe Windypants!

::{{d|event|All laugh except for Gumball and Darwin as the former shakes his head in disapproval}}

:{{d|richard}}: Oh, man, {{d|event|Wipes a tear of laughter off his cheek}} I wish I could be there to see that pizza arrive!

:{{d|larry}}: Okay, four-twenty Grove Street, here we go.

::{{d|event|Larry drives away on his bike, arrives back at Fervidus Pizza and knocks on the door}}

:{{d|larry}}: Pizza guy!

::{{d|event|Larry takes off his delivery cap and puts on his worker cap}}

:{{d|larry}}: {{d|event|As seller}} What are you talking about? I ''sell'' pizzas, why would I ''buy'' one?

:{{d|larry}}: {{d|event|As delivery guy}} Well, someone's gotta pay for this.

:{{d|larry}}: {{d|event|As seller}} I'm not paying for something I didn't order!

:{{d|larry}}: {{d|event|As delivery guy}} What am I supposed to do with this now?

:{{d|larry}}: {{d|event|As seller}} Give it to me! I'll show ya!

::{{d|event|Larry motions throwing the pizza to himself and smacks it on his own face}}

:{{d|larry}}: I think all these jobs are messing with my head.

==The First Dodge==
::{{d|event|The scene changes back to the Watterson house as Anais struggles to put on a hat. Anais, with her first Daar, is wearing every piece of clothing in the house, in an immobile mass of textile}}

:{{d|Anais}}: I'm now wearing everything... in the house! Okay, can someone move me forward?

::{{d|event|Gumball pushes her, causing her to roll forward}}

:{{d|Anais}}: I meant my piece on the-- Uh! {{d|event|Bumps into a table, causing a flowerpot to fall and break}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Okay, that's six spaces, putting you ahead of Gumball, Darwin, Dad, and... me. Although of course, technically, this card says every "thing" in the house.

:{{d|Anais}}: I ''am'' wearing everything! Even Dad's fat camp girdle!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Everything, Anais, not just clothes. The couch is a thing, are you wearing that?

:{{d|Anais}}: What?! But--

:{{d|Nicole}}: Tut-tut-tut! No arguing, young lady. You need to learn to be a good loser. {{d|event|Moves Anais' piece back six spaces}} Now take your Dodge. {{d|event|Takes one card from the Dodge deck}} "The floor is now red hot lava."

::{{d|event|Suddenly, the bottom of Anais' extra layers of clothes gets very hot, and Anais leaps out of the clothes onto the couch, squealing. Anais tries to rub off the heat of her scorching red feet}}

:{{d|Anais}}: I actually felt that through six pairs of shoes!

:{{d|Darwin}}: It's starting! We have to finish the game quickly before it gets ahold of us and destroys us all!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, keep it together!

::{{d|event|Darwin slaps Gumball}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF! YOU'RE UNDERREACTING!

:{{d|Gumball}}: THANKS MAN! I NEEDED THAT! I GOT A BIT CALM FOR A SECOND BUT NOW I REALIZE HOW SERIOUS THIS IS!

::{{d|event|Darwin rolls the dice and picks up a Dare card}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: AAAAH! DARE! RUN PAST A DOG WEARING A SUIT OF HAM! That doesn't sound too bad.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Really? Don't you remember when ''I'' got that one?

::{{d|Event|Flashback shows Gumball running away from a dog herd wearing a suit of ham. After jumping over a fence, Richard, hissing like a cat, appears out of nowhere, sinking his teeth into Gumball and shaking him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: The worst part is it took four weeks to stitch that suit and it was gone in under a minute.

::{{D|event|Richard laughs nervously and hisses with a cat face}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{D|event|Screams}} You're right, I'll take a Dodge! {{D|event|Picks up a Dodge card}} "Your left arm must do like the player to your right's arm does, and vice versa."

:{{d|Anais}}: What does that mean?

:{{d|Richard}}: Means I can do this! {{D|event|Moves his finger toward Anais, making Darwin poke Gumball; he laughs}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey! {{D|event|Richard pokes repeatedly}} Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! {{d|event|Grabs Darwin's arm and slaps him}} Hey!

:{{d|Richard}}: Ow.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dare. "Take a Dodge." Aww, man. {{d|event|Picks up a card}}) "CSD."

:{{d|Anais}}: What's CSD?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Compulsive singing disorder. It means that I could sing at {{d|event|Singing}} ''anyti-i-ime!''

:{{d|Richard}}: "Eat one hundred hot dogs in under a minute." That's not a Dare! That's Tuesday!

::{{d|event|Richard rushes to the kitchen. Then, Darwin moves his hand to his mouth quickly and repeatedly due to the effect of the Dodj and stops, catching his breath}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I think he stopped. {{d|event|His left hand moves to his mouth}} Aw, dude, he's drinking the brine!

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|reads her card and puts it down}} Boys, I'm not using spray cheese instead of deodorant. Give me a Dodge card. {{d|event|Takes the card from Gumball}} From now on, you will doubt every thought you have. That's ridiculous. There's no way a board game can make that happen.

::{{d|event|A freaky, tumor-like head suddenly grows on Nicole's head}}

:{{d|Head of Doubt}}: Or ''can'' it?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Is that head real?

:{{d|Darwin}}: It's as real as you believe it is, until the game ends.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Maybe now you're starting to realize... {{D|event|Singing}} how dangerous this game really is! {{d|event|Speaking}} That came out way less ominous than I was hoping for.

:{{d|Anais}}: Give me the dice. {{d|event|Steps on the floor, but since the floor is still lava to her, she shrieks and jumps back onto couch, rubbing her burning socks}} Ah, ah, ah! Why is it still burning?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: We told you. Nothing stops until you finish the game.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Well, then, I'm finishing the game right now.

:{{d|Head of Doubt}}: Or ''are'' you?

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Every sentence you say is going to start with "or," isn't it?

:{{d|Head of Doubt}} : Or ''is'' it?

:{{d|Nicole}}: I'll take that as a yes.

:{{d|Head of Doubt}}: Or ''will''--

:{{d|Nicole}}: Yes!

:{{d|Gumball}}: It won't make any difference, Mom. The game's too powerful.

:{{d|Nicole}}: The only power this game has is the power you give it.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Then why's my hand moving again?

:{{d|Nicole}}: The game's finished, Richard.

:{{d|Richard}}: But these pickled eggs aren't!

::{{d|event|Nicole sighs. Nicole approaches Darwin, takes his right hand and hits the left one. In the kitchen, Richard drops the food he was eating}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Oh! Aw...

==At Nicole's Office==
::{{d|event|At her bureau at the Rainbow Factory, Nicole picks up a ringing phone}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Rainbow Complaints Office, how can I help you? This sounds like a very simple problem.

:{{d|Head of Doubt}}: Or ''is'' it?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Zip it, you goblin-faced lump! No, sir, I wasn't talking to you. {{d|event|To shouting cient}} I'm sure you're a very handsome man.

:{{d|Head of Doubt}}: Or ''is'' he?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Don't you think it's hard enough to deal with idiots all day without ''you'' pestering me too?! {{d|event|To shouting client}} Sorry. Yes, sir, I suppose some of that ''was'' directed at you. {{d|event|Client yelling}} Yes, of course, I'll put you through to my supervisor.

:{{d|Head of Doubt}}: Or will you?

:{{d|Nicole}}: I'm gonna pop you, you--

::{{d|event|Nicole knocks herself in the head repeatedly with the phone until she passes out}}

==At Mr. Small's Class==
::{{d|event|At Elmore Junior High, Gumball is reading aloud his essay in front of the class}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: And so, in conclusion, if Earth's temperature were to rise by just one degree, average sea levels would rise, leading to a {{d|event|Singing}} ''massive tragedy!''

::{{d|event|The class laughs}}

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​: Oh, I didn't realize you thought global warming was such a laughing matter. Three hours detention. {{d|event|To the class}} Now, who would like to volunteer for my outdoor meditation retreat instead of having a summer vacation?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Raising his left arm}} What the? {{d|event|Darwin pulls his arm down. At the home shed, Richard's left hand is pulled down too, as he tries to reach for the chainsaw}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Come... on...

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​: Very good, Darwin. And who wants to take the vow of silence, as well?

::{{d|event|Darwin still tries to pull his arm down}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Come... on...

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​: You won't regret it. And finally, we also need a volunteer for the eco-protest this weekend where we chain ourselves to a doomed tree for forty-eight hours.

::{{d|event|Darwin's arm is still raised}}

: {{d|Mr. Small}}​​​: Are you sure, Darwin? I'm not gonna lie to you, buddy. {{d|event|Laughing}} We're gonna get maced.

::{{d|event|Darwin screams in forcing his arm down, making the chainsaw in Richard's uncontrolled hand saw part of the shed}}

==It's Do or Die Time==
::{{d|event|Everyone comes back home, where Anais is sitting on the couch in the living room massaging her socks}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, {{d|Nicole}} and {{d|Richard}}: We have to finish the game!

:{{d|Richard}}: Just roll the cards and pick the dice! Just get on with it!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay. We need maximum rolls every turn, which means no Dodges. No matter how bad the Dares are. Agreed? {{d|event|Rolls the dice and draws a Daar card}} Dodge.

:{{d|Anais}}: What happened to taking every Dare?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Do you really want to see me clean myself with my tongue?

:{{d|Nicole}}, {{d|Richard}}, and {{d|Anais}}: Ew!

:{{d|Darwin}}: DODGE DODGE DOOODGE!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dramatic music will play until the end of the game.

::{{d|event|Dramatic music begins to play}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Dare. Juggle flaming knives.

::{{d|event|Scene cuts to Richard holding two flaming knives}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Come on, Richard! You can do it!

::{{d|event|Richard tries to juggle the knives, and they plunge into the ceiling}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Never mind! We'll deal with that later. {{d|event|Rolls the dice and draws a Dare card}} Drive a car from the backseat.

::{{d|event|Nicole tries to drive the car from the backseat with two broomsticks}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: I can do it! I can do it!

:{{d|Head of Doubt}}: Or ''can'' you?

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Grunts}} Shut up, will you?!

::{{d|event|She punches her head and loses control of the car. The car then collides with a street light, making it fall onto the Wattersons' house}}

::{{d|event|Anais moves her piece on the board}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Dodge bomb! What's that?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Singing}} ''Everyone, take a Dodge card!''

::{{d|event|Everyone groans and draws a Dodge card}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Freeze frame. Does that mean I'll-- {{d|event|Freezes as if paused on a VHS player}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: See? That's what we told you! If we all get stuck by a Dodge, we'll remain like this forever!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Movie earthquake. {{d|event|Shaking}} Whoa-oah!

:{{d|Richard}}: Gravity is your enemy. What does that-- {{d|event|His body gets contorted by gravity}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Giant hands. {{d|event|Her hands grow larger}}

:{{d|Head of Doubt}}: Or ''are'' they?

::{{d|event|She punches her head and knocks herself out in to the backyard}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Inverted mermaid!

:{{d|Richard}}: Nothing happened.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Well, I'm kind of that already... fish head, legs...

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Entering}} Come on! Roll the dice!

:{{d|Richard}}: Date a sheep.

::{{d|event|The scene cuts to Richard dating a sheep at a restaurant}}

:{{d|Richard}}: I'll have the lamb.

::{{d|event|The sheep baas}}

:{{d|Richard}}: I meant chicken! {{d|event|Notices the waiter is a chicken}} I meant the check!

::{{d|event|The scene switches back at the house}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Singing}} Bathtub sled! {{d|event|Rides a bathtub down the stairs and penetrates the front door}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: We're nearly there!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Now we need to land on the last square with an exact roll.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Here we go! {{d|event|Rolls dice}} Five! Oh, no, Dodge bomb again! {{d|event|Draws Dodge card}} No one is allowed to breathe until the game is over!

:{{d|Head of Doubt}}: Or ''are'' they?

::{{d|event|Everyone suffocates}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Please... be a six!

::{{d|event|The die is thrown, and it results in a three}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Are you kidding me?!

::{{d|event|Nicole smashes the ground with her giant hand, causing the die to rotate again in a six, therefore ending the game. All effects caused by the Dodges disappear, and the Wattersons are able to breathe again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yes! We survived! All the effects of the game have been reversed! 

::{{d|event|The family notices all the damage brought about by their own actions is still present}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Almost.

::{{d|event|Episode ends}}
