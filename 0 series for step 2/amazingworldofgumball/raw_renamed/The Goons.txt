==I Wanna be Dumb==
::{{d|event|Richard, Gumball and Darwin are fooling around, playing "Butt Puppets." They all have their butts on the table, with sunglasses on them; Anais is making puzzles with Nicole at the coffee table}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Get off my lawn, Watterson!
:{{d|Richard}}: "Butt" why, Mr. Robinson?
:{{d|Darwin}}: Don't be so cheeky!
::{{d|event|Richard, Gumball and Darwin laugh; Camera cuts to Anais}}
:{{d|Nicole}}: C'mon sweetie, one puzzle; one thousand pieces of fun.
:{{d|Anais}}: Mom, can we do something, you know...not boring?
:{{d|Nicole}}: You mean like the two thousand piece puzzle?
:{{d|Anais}}: No something more like that.
::{{d|event|Camera turns back to Richard, Darwin and Gumball}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm going to get to the ''bottom'' of this.
::{{d|event|Everyone Laughs}}
:{{d|Richard}}: Hahahaha, bottom!
:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Opens puzzle}} Anais, I think you are a bit too intelligent for that kind of behavior.
:{{d|Anais}}: Well if being intelligent means no fun then I don't want to be intelligent anymore. {{d|event|Walks away}} By the way those go there. {{d|event|Quickly finishes puzzle}}
:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Pulls out a camera and takes picture}} Nice...
::{{d|event|Anais walks up to Gumball}}
:{{d|Anais}}: Gumball, can I speak to you?
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Flicks fingers and points to his bottom}} My eyes are up here.
:{{d|Anais}}: How come you guys never ask me to play with you.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, {{d|event|Cleans glasses}} we thought you liked puzzles.
:{{d|Anais}}: Yeah, puzzles are okay, but i'd like to join you and be dumb for a change, just for a day.
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Scratches butt}} For a day, huh...
:{{d|Richard}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Hmm...
:{{d|Darwin}}: I think we should give her a chance.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay then.
:{{d|Anais}}: Yay!

=="I'm the President."==
::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin and Anais are in the garden}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Here's a game we like to play. It's called  "I'm the President".
:{{d|Anais}}: What are the rules?
:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, I'm the president, and you have to do what I say.
:{{d|Darwin}}: Yes sir, Mr. President, sir!
:{{d|Gumball}}: Now, go get the stinkiest thing you can find in the house.
:{{d|Darwin}}: Yes sir, Mr. President, sir!
::{{d|event|Darwin runs away and Gumball raises eyebrow at Anais}}
:{{d|Anais}}: I'm not doing that!
:{{d|Gumball}}: You have to, I'm the President.
:{{d|Anais}}: But the...but...Why?
::{{d|event|Darwin comes back with a sock on a stick}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: Mr. President sir, I found one of Mr. Dad's socks.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Is it sweaty?
:{{d|Darwin}}: Yes sir, it's crunchy on the outside and moldy on the inside. Just the way you like it, sir!
:{{d|Gumball}}: Good job, soldier! This shall be our flag, and in Dumb Land, what's the motto?
:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: "Dumbus Kissus Flagus!"
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin kiss the flag and fall down, groaning}}
:{{d|Anais}}: This is so dumb.
:{{d|Darwin}}: That's the point! {{d|event|Continues groaning}}
:{{d|Anais}}: I just don't get it.
::{{d|event|Nicole speaks to Anais from inside the house}}
:{{d|Nicole}}: Anais, look, honey! Porcupine parade, three thousand pieces!
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} Please, teach me.

==How to be Dumb==
::{{d|event|Back in the Wattersons' house}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay now, notepad ready?
:{{d|Anais}}: Yep.
:{{d|Gumball}}: The first rule of dumb is that dumb people don't take notes.
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Writing down on her notepad}} Don't...take...notes.
::{{d|event|Darwin walks up to Anais, grabs her notepad and hands it to Gumball. Gumball checks the notepad, then throws it outside, breaking the window; The notepad lands on Mr. Robinson's windshield while he is driving}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|While driving}} Aaaaaah!
::{{d|event|His car crashes into a fire hydrant}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|Screaming angrily}} My car!
::{{d|event|Camera cuts back to Watterson's lounge room}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Now, if you want to be dumb, you've got to speak dumb. Darwin and me will demonstrate; dumb.
:{{d|Darwin}}: Dumb.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Dumb dumb dumb.
:{{d|Darwin}}: Dumb dumb dumb dumb.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Now you try it.
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Looks confused}} Dumb dumb dumb?
::{{d|event|Gumball starts to chuckle and Darwin is shocked}}
:{{d|Anais}}: What?
:{{d|Gumball}}: It's just what you said is really rude.
:{{d|Darwin}}: Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
:{{d|Anais}}: Well, come on, how do you speak dumb?
:{{d|Gumball}}: Here's a little song that might help you.
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin coughing for the song}}
:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Singing while playing the air guitar}} Dumb dumb dumb, dumb dumb dumb, duh duh dumb dumb dumb.
::{{d|event|Gumball raises his hand with a rock sign}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Performing his air guitar solo while singing}} Dumb duh duh duh dumb, duma duma duma duma duma dumaner DUM.
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin breath of exhaustion}}
:{{d|Anais}}: Nope, I don't get it.

==Knowing How to be Dumb==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the kitchen}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, now Anais I want you to make a sandwich but like a dumb person would.
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are staring at Anais, when Anais is squirting mayonnaise on the bread, then Gumball and Darwin chuckle}}
:{{d|Anais}}: What?
:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, nothing! It's just smart people always struggle with that one.
:{{d|Anais}}: How do you do it then?
:{{d|Gumball}}: Watch and learn.
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin run around the table, then put the bread on the table; They slam their faces into the bread and it sticks to them; Darwin holds a stick of butter, then Gumball grabs some of the butter and puts some on the bread on his face while Darwin throws Swiss cheese into the air; Gumball and Darwin slam the bread on their faces into the Swiss cheese, then the bread comes off their faces and the completed sandwich lands on the table}}
:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|While clapping}} Ha ha ha ha ha.
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Confused}} Nope, I don't get it.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the backyard}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Look, it's not complicated, all you need to do is think dumb, Darwin if you please.
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Trying to pop up his head}} Huuuuah {{d|event|Opens up his head, exposing his brain}} Take a look.
::{{d|event|Anais takes a look inside Darwin's head, Darwin's brain has 2 eyes and a body; it is tap dancing to some music; Anais still looks confused}}
:{{d|Anais}}: I'm never going to get this.
::{{d|event|Darwin closes his head}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Ah, don't feel bad. It takes years of dedication to think dumb like we do.
:{{d|Anais}}: Aw, come on, guys. You guys don't think dumb, you don't think at all. {{d|event|Anais realizes something and whispers}} That's it! {{d|event|Then back to her normal voice}} That's it, you literally don't think at all.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Hum humph.
:{{d|Anais}}: For example, {{d|event|Holding a red pepper}} most people will think twice about putting a hot chili in their mouth, but because you didn't think even once.
::{{d|event|Gumball is jumping in pain because his mouth is on fire}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: AHHH! Ohh! AHHHH!
:{{d|Anais}}: You've already done it, {{d|event|Raising her arms up}} I finally get it! I know how to be dumb!
:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: YAY!!
::{{d|event|The door to the kitchen opens, revealing Richard}}
:{{d|Richard}}: Anyone want to play fruitball?
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Jumping}} I do! I do!
:{{d|Richard}}: Really? {{d|event|Whispers}} I thought she liked puzzles.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Not anymore.
:{{d|Anais}}: I'm now fluent in the beautiful art of dumbness.
:{{d|Richard}}: Okay then. She's in.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey, what are you doing?
:{{d|Anais}}: We're toe wrestling with dad. {{d|event|Anais' big toe has the drawing of a bearded wrestler and Darwin's big toe has the drawing and is decorated as a blond wrestler}} This little Pinky's going down.
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|In a deep voice}} I'm gonna toe nail you to the floor.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Cool. Can I join in?
:{{d|Darwin}}: Mr. Dad's only got two feet and they're kinda taken.
:{{d|Gumball}}: That's okay. I can be the referee.
:{{d|Anais}}: We already have one. {{d|event|Anais and Darwin's foot are pushing each other}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Dumbus Kissus Flagus!
:{{d|Richard}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Yes, madam president! {{d|event|They kiss the sock/flag and falls down}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: I can't believe this. I told her how to be dumb, and now she's totally stealing Dad. 
:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, don't be like that, honey. I'm sure they'll include you in a second.
::{{d|event|Richard, Darwin, and Anais are now playing video games on the couch}}
:{{d|Anais}}: This couch is really good for three people.
:{{d|Richard}}: Yeah, if we had a fourth person, it would be kinda cramped.
::{{d|event|Gumball grunts}}
:{{d|Nicole}}: Okay, well...{{d|event|Gasps}} how about you play with me?!
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Uninterested}} Yeah, okay, see how she likes it if I steal Mom from her!

:{{d|Richard}}, {{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: EARTHQUAKE!
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Looks through the door's window}} She thinks she's so dumb. Well, I'll show her who's the dumbest in the whole town! Then Dad will be mine again! {{d|event|Starts laughing maniacally}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: You're here to race. As you can see, I've gathered the stupidest people in town.

Anyone opening their eyes is disqualified. {{d|event|Everyone puts on their blindfolds}} On your marks, get set, wait for it, go! {{d|event|Everyone starts running}} Oh! {{d|event|Puts on his blindfold}} I can't resist the call of dumbness! {{d|event|Starts running}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: You might have won Dad sis, but I'm not gonna let you win this!

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​: I'm winning, I'm winning! {{d|event|Accidentally grabs some balloons and floats away}} I'M NOT WINNING!

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Stops running and puts Larry down}} This is happening so fast! Erm oh, I am not saying no, {{d|event|Removes blindfold}} definitely not saying no. {{d|event|Sighs}} But I need to think about this. {{d|event|Richard walks around the park thinking, and then sits on a bench. Tobias is seen floating away}}
::{{d|event|Scene changes to Gumball and Anais again}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: You're taking my place at home, and I am taking it back!
:{{d|Anais}}: Are you kidding Gumball? I just want to be dumb for a day! No one could be dumber than you!
::{{d|event|They both stop running}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Wow! That's a really nice thing to say, I kinda feel awkward now!
:{{d|Anais}}: Should we just hug?
:{{d|Gumball}}: Gosh, ya, okay!
