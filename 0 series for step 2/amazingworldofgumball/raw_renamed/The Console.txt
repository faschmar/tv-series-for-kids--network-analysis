==The Living Room==
::{{d|event|Gumball is lying on the couch reading a comic book. Richard approaches with a sly smile and clears his throat}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Annoyed}} What?

:{{d|Richard}}: Remember your last birthday present?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sarcastically}} How can I forget? My present was an IOU.

:{{d|Richard}}: Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna need that back.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs and sits up}} Really?

::{{d|event|Gumball holds out the IOU, which Richard takes and rips in half}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Because... {{d|event|Pulls out a handheld gaming console from behind his back}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Screams excitedly and takes the console}} You got me a Game... {{d|event|Looks at the front of the console, which is labeled GameChild™}} ...Child? {{d|event|Turns the console over}} Made in Chainor? This is such a knock-off even the country it was made in is a knock-off! {{d|event|Sighs}} Did you buy it from the back of that van?

:{{d|Richard}}: Yeah, the Awesome Store. What's the problem? Everything we have is a knock-off. Our TV? It's a Soppy. Only two letters different, but that never stopped you from watching it. Your superhero, Badman, he's a knock-off too. But you love his morally dubious adventures. Even our doctor only has a doctorate in fine arts, {{d|event|Lifts up his shirt to reveal stitches in the shape of a fruit plate}} but he did a great job on my appendix scar.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, thungs.

:{{d|Richard}}: What?

:{{d|Gumball}}: That's knock-off for thanks.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Turns to leave}} That's the spirit. {{d|event|Walks out of the room}}

::{{d|event|The console turns on as it makes a "ping!" sound}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: "Inverted Paradox: The Enemy Within?" {{d|event|Sighs}} JRPG titles never make sense; they're just random words thrown together. The fashion equivalent would be wearing a Hawaiian shirt, ski boots and a top hat. Actually that does explain how the characters normally look.

::{{d|event|Gumball struggles to operate the console}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Dad, your console's not working! {{d|e|Reads}} "Go to bathroom, attic, bedroom"?

::{{d|event|Gumball presses the 'bedroom' button, and the entire scene starts to fade to black as he screams repeatedly, then he teleports to his bedroom}}

==The Bedroom==

:{{D|Gumball}}: Dude, what is going on?!

:{{D|Darwin}}: There you are! Sorry, I forgot your name.

::{{d|event|The screen shows a name selector}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Please enter name? {{d|event|Gasps}} I've trapped us inside a video game! {{d|event|Singsong voice}} Awesome!

::{{d|event|Gumball types in a name}}

:{{D|Darwin}}: Please, MYBUTT, tell me what is going on.

::{{d|event|Gumball snickers as Darwin and Anais talk to each other}}

::{{d|event|Anais walks in}}

:{{D|Anais}}: A foul curse has been released upon our town by MYBUTT.

:{{D|Darwin}}: You mean the gates of doom were opened by MYBUTT?

:{{D|Anais}}: The fabric of the universe was ripped apart by MYBUTT.

:{{D|Darwin}}: MYBUTT has made quite a mess.

::{{d|event|Gumball begins laughing hysterically}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Surely this is gonna get old at some point.

:{{D|Darwin}}: Here's some healing ointment to help MYBUTT in the heat of battle!

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Laughs and wipes a tear away}} Nope.

:{{D|Voice}}: "Anais and Darwin have joined your team".

::{{d|event|Ping! The screen shows that Gumball has received the bottle of healing ointment}}

==Outside==
:{{D|Darwin}}: Oh no, the path is blocked by an awkwardly placed shrub! And we're apparently too stupid to walk on the lawn.

::{{d|event|Gumball selects an axe from the console}}

:{{D|Voice}}: "MYBUTT uses AXE. It is ineffective".

::{{d|event|Gumball selects a saw}}

:{{D|Voice}}: "MYBUTT uses SAW. It is ineffective".

:{{D|Gumball}}: Can MYBUTT just use common sense and walk around it?!

:{{D|Voice}}: "MYBUTT uses SARCASM. It is ineffective".

:{{D|Gumball}}: Argh! {{d|event|Kicks the shrub}}

::{{d|event|Screen spins and reveals a hideous flower monster. It sends leaves toward Gumball}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Pfft, I'm pretty sure I can handle a few le— {{d|event|The leaves slash his face}} Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah! Ach! {{d|event|Falls to the ground}}

:{{D|Voice}}: MYBUTT receives CRITICAL damage.

::{{D|event|Gumball snickers}}

:{{D|Anais}}: A leaf monster would be susceptible to fire attacks.

:{{D|Gumball}}: Yes, I think most things are susceptible to fire attacks. {{d|event|Selects "Science" attack on the console}}

::{{d|event|Anais rises with powers; dramatically pours chemical from test tube to test tube and then throws it at the flower monster, defeating it}}

:{{D|All}}: Woah! Yeah! Awesome!

:{{D|Darwin}}: We did it! 

::{{d|event|The Watterson kids pose in victory}}

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin and Anais walk towards the path and seemingly out of nowhere, Leslie appears behind them}}

:{{D|Darwin}}: Leslie? What happened to you?

:{{D|Leslie}}: I bought some fertilizer from THE AWESOME STORE. I went home after visiting THE AWESOME STORE and used the fertilizer I'd just bought at THE AWESOME STORE...

:{{D|Leslie}}: {{d|event|In the background}} But who will stand up to such a dangerous enemy as...

:{{D|Gumball}}: Okay! Okay! We got it, we got it. The awesome store is the villain.

:{{D|Leslie}}: THE AWESOME STORE...

:{{D|Darwin}}: MAKE IT STOP!

:{{D|Leslie}}: {{d|event|In the background}} The problem is no-one knows how to find...

:{{D|Gumball}}: I can't! There's no command to skip through his cutscene.

:{{D|Leslie}}: THE AWESOME STORE...

:{{D|Darwin}}: DO SOMETHING!

:{{D|Gumball}}: Hold on! 

::{{d|event|Gumball takes Darwin's dialogue box from the bottom of the screen}}

:{{D|Leslie}}: THE AWESO—

::{{d|event|Gumball proceeds to hit Leslie with the box. Leslie left unconscious and the letters in his new dialouge are now mixed up}}

:{{D|Anais}}: We could've just walked away. But now maybe we should run.

::{{d|event|The Watterson kids run. The scene fades to black and switches to the porch of the Robinson household}}

:{{D|Anais}}: What are we doing at Mr. Robinson's?

:{{D|Gumball}} {{d|event|Searching through items}} Getting loot.

:{{D|Anais}}: I think you mean looting.

:{{D|Gumball}} No, if there are items hidden in these pots, they must be for me.

:{{D|Anais}}: No, I'm pretty sure the mailman hid them there so people like you wouldn't steal them.

::{{D|Event|The Wattersons kids enter the house}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: No, that's how it works in RPGs. Whatever you find, you take.

:{{D|Darwin}}: I don't know. There was no *BUDABLING* sound when you took that VHS player. Right now it just feels like you're ransacking an old man's house.

:{{D|Gumball}}: I'm sure Mr. Robinson doesn't mind.

:{{D|Mr. Robinson}}: Welcome to my home. Please take whatever you need for your quest.

:{{D|Gumball}}: Hm. {{d|event|Takes Mr. Robinson's money}} I'm gonna go sleep in his bed now.

::{{D|event|A single tear slides down Mr. Robinson's smiling face. The scene transitions to the street, with Anais wearing a soldier outfit with a giant, robotic sword}}

:{{D|Anais}}: What's with this new outfit? Can someone explain why this gigantic sword has a trigger?

:{{D|Gumball}}: Yeah, well you did reject the alternative outfit.

:{{D|Anais}}: Yeah I don't think that was age appropriate.

::{{d|event|Gumball changes her outfit back to normal}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: But those leather platform boots would have given you plus five vision!

:{{D|Anais}}: How?

:{{D|Gumball}}: Well, they make you taller, don't they?

:{{D|Anais}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} Oh, that actually makes sense.

::{{D|Event|Gumball walks into Penny, equipped with a mechanical eye, who turns around and roars. Scene cuts to a battle scene}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Oh, man. I can't fight my girlfriend!

:{{D|Darwin}}: You have to!

::{{D|event|Penny roars and is about to attack them}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Uh, okay, I'll try to calm her down. Oh, how 'bout a gift?

::{{D|event|Gumball selects "Item." He summons the VHS player with a heart animation and throws it at her}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: I love you!

::{{D|event|VHS player hits Penny in the head, leaving her face disfigured; the battle ends. Gumball, Darwin, and Anais do the victory dance with horrified faces}}

:{{D|Penny}}: {{D|event|Slurring}} Thanks for saving me. The cellphone I bought from THE AWESOME STORE took possession of me. {{D|event|Removes the smartphone from her face}} Here, take it. It will help you in battle.

:{{D|Voice}}: "Smartphone acquired. You may now summon friends in battle".

:{{D|Gumball}}: Thanks Penny. Sorry about the whole disfiguring you with the VHS player thing. {{d|event|Kisses Penny on the cheek}}

:{{D|Penny}}: {{D|event|Slurring}} No problem. Just a scratch.

::{{D|event|The Watterson kids walk away, but as they do, Penny and her dialogue box fall to the ground. The scene fades and cuts back to the trio}}

:{{D|Darwin}}: Wait, I think this person has a clue for us!

:{{D|Gumball}}: Really? I wonder what makes you say that.

::{{D|event|It is shown that Alison is feeding her pigeons. Gumball commences his interaction with her by pushing a button on the console}}

:{{D|Alison}}: Hello. I've lost my pigeons. Will you help me find them?

::{{D|event|The screen shows a map indicating all the spots the pigeons are at}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: No! A super tedious side quest that preys on every gamer's weakness!

:{{D|Anais}}: Tortilla chips and sugary drinks?

:{{D|Gumball}}: No!

:{{D|Darwin}}: The sun?

:{{D|Gumball}}: No, the compulsive need to complete every game 100 percent.

::{{D|event|Screen reads, "400 packs of tortilla chips, 300 cans of energy drinks LATER." Gumball, shown as an overweight nerd, enters back to Alison, letting her take the pigeons}}

:{{D|Voice}}: "You've earned the NO LIFE trophy".

:{{D|Gumball}}: Worth it.

==Preparing for the Awesome Store==
::{{D|event|Scene cuts to the world map}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Okay, we need to find this AWESOME STORE before we all start growing anime hair.

::{{D|event|Anais grows an anime hairstyle resembling Rizelea's}}

:{{D|Anais}}: But where is it?

::{{D|event|Gumball grows an anime hairstyle resembling Cloud Strife's}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: There must be a clue somewhere.

::{{D|event|Darwin grows an anime hairstyle resembling Sephiroth's}}

:{{D|Darwin}}: How about that?

::{{D|event|Camera moves to show a building with a gold skull and a thundercloud above it}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Yeah, that'll be it.

:{{D|Anais}}: Wait, we can't go yet! We don't have enough XPs to fight the boss.

:{{D|Gumball}}: Then, we'll do the things that make up most RPGs— GRIND!

:{{D|Anais}}: What's that?

:{{D|Gumball}}: Fighting menial enemies until we're stacked!

::{{D|event|Scene transitions to a battle montage involving fighting squirrels, birds, rats, butterflies, squirrels again, birds again, and a bunny, squirrel, and bird; a battle theme plays. They no longer have anime hair}}

:{{D|Anais}}: Hmmm. We still need more XPs. But there are no enemies left to fight.

::{{D|event|They look around, and proceed to attack several residents of Elmore}}

:{{D|Billy}}: No, no, no— Aah!

::{{D|event|Victorious music plays}}

:{{D|Darwin}}: We're finally strong enough to take on THE AWESOME STORE! Let's go!

:{{D|Gumball}}: Wait, don't you kinda want to hear that awesome battle music one last time?

::{{D|event|Battle theme plays}}

:{{D|Gumball}}, {{D|Darwin}}, and {{D|Anais}}: Do-ba-do-ba-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-ba-do-ba-do, ba-na-na-na.

::{{D|event|Scene cuts to Gumball, Darwin, and Anais about to go through the entrance of the building; menacing music plays}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: You guys ready? 'Cause there's no turning back.

:{{D|Darwin}} and {{D|Anais}}: Mm-hmm.

::{{D|event|All go through}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|He tries to go back, but there's a force that pushes him}} No, no, wait. I forgot to save! I forgot to save!

:{{D|Darwin}}: It's too late! The cut scene already started!

:{{D|Gumball}}: No, no, no— NOOOOOOOO!

::{{D|event|Thunder crashes. Pipes drip, while the scene cuts to the trio walking through with worry}}

:{{D|Van Shopkeeper}}: Welcome.

::{{D|event|They gasp. Scene cuts to a man, showing only his eyes, opening the Awesome Store}}

:{{D|Van Shopkeeper}}: Welcome to the end of your quest. Prepare to fight your true enemy.

:{{D|event|Gumball, Darwin, and Anais scream terrified and abruptly attack the Awesome Store with magic powers}}

:{{D|Van Shopkeeper}}: JEEZ LOUISE! I was about to explain how we're allies, not enemies.

:{{D|Gumball}}: Oh, uh, sorry. It's just you looked so evil, and you sold people all those cursed objects and stuff.

:{{D|Van Shopkeeper}}: What do they expect when they buy things from the back of a van?

:{{D|Gumball}}: Fair point. Anyway, what were you saying?

:{{D|Van Shopkeeper}}: The secret is not a game. The secret to beat the game is to beat the game.

:{{D|Gumball}}: Uhhhhhhh, what?

:{{D|Van Shopkeeper}}: The console is the enemy.

:{{D|Gumball}}: Ohh! "Inverted Paradox: The Enemy Within." So the name actually meant something. Makes sense, because we're playing the game in real life and the enemy is— AAH!

==The Console==
::{{D|event|Gumball screams; the Game Child console turns into a "boss" creature and the scene cuts to a battle. It roars}}

:{{D|Anais}}: How do we fight? We don't have the console anymore.

:{{D|Gumball}}: We take it on, hand to hand. Hi-yah!

::{{D|event|He performs a karate chop, but it doesn't reach the console creature}}

:{{D|Anais}}: Aren't you supposed to actually hit it?

:{{D|Gumball}}: I'm not touching that with my bare hands. I don't know where its tentacles have been.

::{{D|event|The console attacks them, causing them to have 1 HP (health point) left}}

:{{D|Anais}}: Wait, what happens in this game if we perish?

:{{D|Gumball}}: I guess we perish in the real world, too. Or worse, we'll have to restart the whole game from the beginning.

::{{D|event|The console roars and shoots lasers that force the three to dodge them}}

:{{D|Darwin}}: Use the potion I gave you!

:{{D|Gumball}}: But we might need it later!

:{{D|Darwin}}: Dude, we literally only have one XP left!

:{{D|Gumball}}: Aw, fine. Yah! 

::{{D|event|Gumball throws the potion; however, it gives the console 650 more health points}}

:{{D|Darwin}}: I meant, use it on us!

:{{D|Anais}}: Gumball, we still have the phone!

:{{D|Gumball}}: Of course! {{D|event|Prepares to throw the phone}}

:{{D|Anais}}: No, we can use it to summon friends in battle!

:{{D|Gumball}}: Oh, yeah, right.

::{{D|event|Gumball dramatically dials his friends and family. Sarah is summoned, and she uses BRAIN FREEZE: she pulls off her head and throws it at the monster, freezing it and taking out 999 health points. Hector is summoned and uses PSYCHE!: he is about to punch it, but instead flicks it, taking out 999 health. Banana Joe is summoned; he uses THOUSAND BLOWS: he dons a run pose, and continuously moves his arms and legs up and down, emanating multiple lasers, each taking 100 health. Carrie is summoned, and she uses STOP HITTING YOURSELF: she possesses the console and hits itself numerous times, each hit taking 100 health. Granny Jojo is summoned; she uses GIVE US A KISS: she pulls out her dentures and throws them at the console creature, and the dentures bite the monster, taking out 999 health. Nicole is summoned; she uses I'M NOT ANGRY JUST DISAPPOINTED: she stares at it with a very stern look, surprisingly taking out 999 health. The camera zooms out, showing a giant Richard in the background. Scene cuts to space, where Richard uses RING OF FIRE: he eats power and farts out a ray of light at it. Gumball presses the phone, and the console screeches as it dies. The battle ends; Gumball, Darwin, and Anais do a victory dance. The game cuts to the credits, displaying the text: INVERTED PARADOX THE ENEMY WITHIN, CREDITS: Directed by." Scene abruptly cuts to Gumball, Darwin and Anais back in reality, on the couch}}

==Back to Reality==
:{{D|Gumball}}: Ah, no one cares about the credits. "Congratulations, you completed the game at eighty-nine percent."

:{{D|Darwin}} and {{D|Anais}}: Yay!

:{{D|Gumball}}: What do you mean, eighty-nine percent? "Do you want to start a new game?"

:{{D|Darwin}} and {{D|Anais}}: {{D|event|Gasps}} NOOOOO—

::{{D|event|Gumball selects "YES," and the episode abruptly ends}}
