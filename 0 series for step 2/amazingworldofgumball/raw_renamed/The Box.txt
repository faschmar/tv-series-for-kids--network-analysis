==A Mysterious Box==
::{{d|event|The episode starts in the Wattersons' living room. Gumball, Darwin, and Anais, are sitting on the couch, each sibling exhibiting an expression of boredom. The doorbell rings, but when Gumball answers the door, all he finds is a nondescript, sealed cardboard box. Curious, he brings it inside. In the meantime, his parents have entered the room}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Did anyone order anything?

:{{d|Richard}}, {{d|Nicole}}, {{d|Darwin}}, and {{d|Anais}}: Nah.

:{{d|richard}}: This was the credit card company's answer when I asked if I can order things online.

::{{d|event|Richard holds up the telephone, and hysterical laughter is heard coming from its speaker}}

:{{d|richard}}: It's been like that for three days. I think they're working in shifts.

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Puts the box on the coffee table}} Well, it ''was'' delivered to our door, so...

::{{d|event|Gumball reaches for it, but Anais grabs both of his wrists. A third hand appears from below, slapping him on the cheek}}

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Confused}} Uh-eh?

:{{d|anais}}: Opening other people's mail is a crime!

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Peeved}} Oh, why is there always a law against everything I wanna do?

:{{d|anais}}: Because the last thing you wanted to do was move into the supermarket so you could eat for free.

:{{d|gumball}}: Uh, if the food enters your body and exits it while it's still in the supermarket, it's technically not stealing.

:{{d|darwin}} and {{d|anais}}: Hmm.

:{{d|gumball}}: Come on! Am I the only one who wants to open the box?

:{{d|richard}}: Opening other people's mail is like staring at the sun. The more people tell you you shouldn't do it, {{d|event|Yearning}} the more you just gotta.

:{{d|nicole}}: Richard, we're over here.

:{{d|richard}}: Oh, yeah, sorry. {{d|event|Faces the wrong direction again}}

:{{d|nicole}}: Now kids, there's plenty of fun things we could do to take our mind off opening the '''box'''. Just think outside the '''box'''. Play some music on the boom'''box''', maybe go watch a '''box'''ing match, {{d|event|Loses control}} or just open the '''box''', the '''box''', '''OPEN THE BOX!'''

::{{d|event|Richard and Darwin hold Nicole back, despite her frenzied attempt at the parcel. She calms down as soon as Gumball picks the box up and shakes it}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Wait, I think I know what it is. It's a teleportation gun.

:{{d|anais}}: How could you possibly know what a fictional object sounds like?

:{{d|gumball}}: Uh, what does a laser sword sound like?

::{{d|event|Richard, Nicole, and Darwin mimic lightsaber noises}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Case closed. Box open.

:{{d|anais}}: We're not opening it!

:{{d|gumball}}: Oh come on! Think about how this can benefit society and enrich our lives...

::{{d|event|"Lives" echoes as the show enters his imagination}}

==Gumball's Fantasy==
::{{d|event|Gumball is on his bed, reading a comic book, when Nicole brings him a bag of trash}}

:{{d|nicole}}: Gumball, I told you to take out the garbage.

::{{d|event|Putting the book down, he grabs the bag, then pulls out a teleportation gun. With it, he first creates a portal on his bedroom floor, then shoots one out the window, above the trash cans. Gumball sends the bag through, and it lands atop a kid riding by on a tricycle}}

:{{d|Blue Humanoid}}: Ah! {{d|event|Groans; Collapses}}

::{{d|event|Next, Gumball and Darwin are on the sofa, playing video games. Having positioned himself so that he is partially sitting inside a portal, Gumball has a smug look on his face. His brother, however, is understandably concerned, as the second portal is located over the toilet}}

:{{d|darwin}}: I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this.

:{{d|gumball}}: Speak for yourself.

::{{d|event|Later, Nicole is washing dishes in the kitchen. Gumball approaches her by placing portals on the floor, one ahead of the other, and passing through them. In the center of the kitchen, he ceases his progression, merely transferring back and forth between the two portals instead}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Hi, Mom.

:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Turns around}} What are you doing?

:{{d|gumball}}: I just found a way— {{d|event|Teleports}} to avoid walking.

:{{d|nicole}}: Are you sure that thing is safe?

:{{d|gumball}}: I think so. {{d|event|Teleports}} What makes you say that?

:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Catches him midair}} Uh, probably that weird thing on your nose.

::{{d|event|A close-up reveals that his nose resembles a humanoid face. Nicole then takes her son to Elmore Hospital}}

:{{d|Bandage Doctor}}: It seems teleportation is dangerously affecting your DNA.

:{{d|gumball}}: So you're saying I'm getting superpowers? {{d|event|Flexes his arms}}

:{{d|Bandage Doctor}}: Mm, no. That's a rather specific interpretation of what I just said.

:{{d|gumball}}: But you're ''not'' saying that I ''won't''.

:{{d|Bandage Doctor}}: Indeed... But I would say there is a ninety-nine point nine percent chance you will turn into a cyst-like pile of flesh with tongues where there shouldn't be tongues.

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Dismayed}} Oh. Uh, right. I... I understand.

:{{d|Bandage Doctor}}: Good. Finally.

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Excited}} So you're saying there's a zero point zero one percent chance that I ''could'' get superpowers! {{d|event|Opens a portal; Hops in}}

:{{d|Bandage Doctor}}: No-no-no-no!

::{{d|event|Back home, Gumball is alone in his bedroom, when Darwin walks in on him}}

:{{d|darwin}}: Hey, dude. {{d|event|Startled}} Whoa-ho-ho-hoa! Looks like you've been teleporting... a lot.

::{{d|event|Gumball is shown to have undergone a horrific mutation. His face now swollen and covered in pustules, he has also sprouted a third arm, as well as a reptilian tail. An egg emerges from a hole on the side of his head, and drops to the floor}}

:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Disturbed}} Whoa. What's that?

:{{d|gumball}}: I've been trying to get superpowers. I wanted to fly, so I took a bird through the portal. But instead, now I can lay eggs. Then I tried to get invisibility, so I took a chameleon through, {{d|event|Expels a larger egg}} and now I can lay chameleon eggs. And then I tried to get super jump, so I took a frog through, and...

:{{d|darwin}}: Now you can lay...

::{{d|event|Darwin is revolted, as his brother produces a pile of frog eggs and tadpoles}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Uh, yeah. So, uh, I decided to take something that ''couldn't'' lay eggs, and... ta-da! {{d|event|Pulls an item from his pocket}}

:{{d|darwin}}: Ah! A laser pointer. Did it work?

:{{d|gumball}}: Sure did. Check this out. {{d|event|Emits green lasers from his eyes}} Laser vision!

:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Unimpressed}} Oh, great. Now I can see exactly where you're looking. But, maybe you should focus some of your efforts on the aesthetic side of superheroes. You know, maybe look a little less like... uh... that. {{d|event|Gestures at Gumball}}

:{{d|gumball}}: You're right. I need to merge with something that looks super cool.

::{{d|event|Downstairs at the dinner table, Gumball's family are shying away, disgusted by his insectoid transformation. Spitting a corrosive substance, he dissolves both food and tableware before consuming it via his proboscis}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Interrupting}} Okay, wait a minute. I'm just gonna say what we're all thinking.

::{{d|event|Gumball's fantasy ends}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Please do.

:{{d|Richard}}: Are you gonna finish that fictional food that's on your plate?

:{{d|Anais}}: What?! No! Why did you choose to merge with a cockroach?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Just imagine what I could do with the powers of a nuclear resistant parasite.

:{{d|Anais}}: Repel girls even more?

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Grabs the box}} Oh, I still don't know what it is, but I know what I wish it was.

==Nicole's Fantasy==
::{{d|event|The Wattersons gather around the box and open it. Their faces light up with joy over the many stacks of cash contained within}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Whoo! We're rich! {{d|event|Throws some money in the air}} We never have to worry about the end of the month again!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I could get a submarine to school every day!

:{{d|Darwin}}: But there's no water between here and school.

::{{d|event|Nicole holds the box under one arm, then collects her kids with the other}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: We'll buy some!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Exactly! 

::{{d|event|Nicole carries her kids out the front door and then returns and drags Richard outside}}

:{{d|Richard}}: I can finally call myself retired instead of unemployed!

::{{d|event|Nicole pushes him outside, and they all pile into the car}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Come on, let's go. {{d|event|Drives away}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Mom, where are you taking us?

:{{d|Nicole}}: You see, such a large amount of cash is bound to belong to somebody shady, and it's very likely they'll— {{d|event|Gets rear-ended}} send someone to retrieve it.

::{{d|event|The other car pulls up beside them}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Wait! So now we're on the run from a hitman?!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Exactly.

::{{d|event|Nicole rams the vehicle, causing him to crash into a parked car. She accelerates, putting some distance between them. Up ahead, there is a railroad crossing, its flashing lights and lowered gate indicative of the imminent train. Her family screams as she breaks through the barrier and crosses the tracks just in the nick of time. Having temporarily escaped the hitman, they bunker down for the night at a small motel}}

:{{d|anais}}: So now we have to live everyday like it's our last?

:{{d|nicole}}: Yes! But isn't that a good philosophy to have? ''Carpe diem''.

::{{d|event|The Wattersons are frightened when the hitman punches through the door}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Get back! Run!

::{{d|event|He unlocks the door and kicks it open, but they have already gone out the window. The family heads into the desert, running for their lives, while the hitman drives after them using a tracker}}

:{{d|anais}}: I think I know how he's tracking us!

:{{d|richard}}: I'm sorry! I'm just so scared!

:{{d|anais}}: What the?! Not that. There must be some kind of tracking device in the money.

::{{d|event|A cliff edge preventing them from going any further, Nicole searches the box for the device. She quickly locates it and hurls it into the chasm. The five of them move off to the side, as the hitman follows the tracker straight over the edge. There is an explosion, and the Wattersons approach the burning wreckage with the hitman trapped inside}}

:{{d|Hitman}}: My employers will never give up. There will be another man after me. Then another, and another after that. You will never find peace.

:{{d|nicole}}: Yes, but we're millionaires.

:{{d|Hitman}}: You'll never get back to your old life. You'll be hunted.

:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Happily pats the box}} Hunted ''millionaires''.

:{{d|Hitman}}: You will never be able to trust anyone. You'll be fugitives.

:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} Fugitive millionaires.

::{{d|event|Anais frees the box from Nicole's grasp, ending her reverie}}

:{{d|Anais}}: I agree with Mom on one thing. What's inside this box is clearly evil.

:{{d|darwin}}: What? Why?

:{{d|Anais}}: Because history has proven that mysterious containers always bring misery. Pandora's Box? 

::{{d|event|A picture is shown of Pandora opening the infamous box, with human skulls floating out of it}}

:{{d|Anais}}: The Lost Ark? 

::{{d|event|A picture is shown of a group of Israelis getting blinded by the light of the ark}}

:{{d|Anais}}: That six-month-old takeout box at the back of the fridge? 

::{{d|event|A picture is shown of Richard getting attacked by a hand made of noodles coming out of a Chinese takeaway box}}

:{{d|Anais}}: My point is, what if this box was never meant to be opened? What if it was...

==Anais' Fantasy==
::{{d|event|A Clipboard Man is in a laboratory, speaking into a video recorder. Behind him, some zombies are trying to find a way inside the room}}

:{{D|Clipboard Man}}: It's been seven weeks since the infection began, and I... I still haven't found a cure. They've taken over everything.

::{{D|event|Large fires are seen burning throughout Elmore. Somewhere in the city, a group of undead have Gary Hedges trapped in a phone booth}}

:{{D|Clipboard Man}}: {{d|event|Narrating}} Our infrastructure has collapsed, the people are on their own.

:{{D|Payphone}}: Hello! You have reached the mailbox of {{d|event|Inhuman growl}} Police Station. All our officers are busy consuming flesh of the living at the moment, so please take the law into your own hands.

::{{D|event|The zombies break through the glass, swarming Gary as he screams}}

:{{d|Gary}}: Oh, wait up.

::{{D|event|They pause, allowing him to hang up the phone and collect his change}}

:{{d|Gary}}: Ah, cool! {{d|event|Resumes screaming}}

:{{D|Clipboard Man}}: Most of the population is now contaminated. Those that haven't transformed yet were already zombies anyway.

::{{d|event|Neck Beard is texting mindlessly, unaware of the world around him. At the school, Tobias fearfully runs to the washroom to hide. He hears a noise from one of the stalls, and backs away as the door opens}}

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​: Ahh! Huh?

::{{d|event|A pair of legs hops from the toilet seat and leaves the room. Tobias turns to the sink and gasps at the sight of a zombie washing its hands. It looks at him and cackles, then pulls him to the floor}}

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: The world as we know it is coming to an end.

::{{d|event|In outer space, a zombified planet Earth is attempting to bite the moon}}

:{{d|The Moon}}: Get off, get off, get off! {{d|event|Orbits around}} Get off, get off, get off!

::{{d|event|Back at the lab, Clipboard Man is still recording himself}}

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: If only I'd known how the virus got out, maybe the infection could have been prevented. {{D|event|Gets dragged off-screen}} How did it all staaa—

::{{D|event|The video cuts to static, leading to a flashback of Richard finding a biohazard container inside the box. In the container is a medical injector gun and several vials of a green liquid}}

:{{D|Richard}}: Oooh! Squirt gun!

::{{d|event|Jazz cue plays as a still frame shows Richard playfully spraying his family with the substance, to Anais' horror, and they return to reality}}

:{{D|Anais}}: We have to destroy that box.

:{{D|Richard}}: I'm sure it's something perfectly normal.

:{{D|Darwin}}: Exactly!

:{{D|Richard}}: Like an accordion made outta bread, or a remote controlled trumpet.

:{{D|Darwin}}: Uh, what?

==Richard's Fantasy==
::{{d|event|Richard pulls a cellphone from the otherwise empty box. It immediately rings, and he answers}}

:{{d|richard}}: {{d|event|Nervous}} Yes?

:{{d|Operative}}: Lazarus. {{d|event|Echoes}}

::{{d|event|Something triggers within Richard, and he recalls being strapped to a hi-tech chair. A shadowy figure is standing before him}}

:{{d|Operative}}: Our scientists have inserted an implant allowing you to use the capacities of your brain at one-hundred percent, making you the ultimate weapon. We will now erase your memory and place you under a false identity until it is time for your mission. Your activation code word is... Lazarus.

::{{d|event|"Lazarus" echoes again, and Richard is now driving down the road while holding the phone to his ear}}

:{{d|Operative}}: Your mission is to save the president. Please hang up. This phone will self-destruct in ten seconds.

::{{d|event|The timer on the cellphone counts down, and Richard accelerates. Up ahead, the president's vehicle is heading towards him. Somewhere in-between, a masked figure prepares to fire a bazooka at the president. Richard drives past him and causes his car to spin out. He skillfully exits the vehicle while it is still in motion, and it acts as a shield to stop the rocket. His phone starts to beep rapidly, and he tosses it at the terrorist, blowing him up. A second masked man charges him, but is quickly dispatched of in hand-to-hand combat}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Opens the car door}} Mr. President, are you okay?

:{{d|The President}}: {{d|event|Timid}} I was so scared.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Softly}} Don't worry, you're safe now.

::{{d|event|Dreamy music plays, and they gaze longingly into each other's eyes. Richard pulls him into an embrace, but their imminent kiss is interrupted by Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh, hang on. No offense, Dad. It sounds cool that you could use the full power of your brain, but a hundred percent of nothing, is still nothing.

::{{d|event|The scenario replays, putting Richard in the driver's seat once more}}

:{{d|Operative}}: Please hang up. This phone will self-destruct in ten seconds.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Jovial}} No, ''you'' hang up.

:{{d|Operative}}: I'm serious. Please hang up.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Giggles}} No, you first.

:{{d|Operative}}: This is a direct order! Please hang up!

:{{d|Richard}}: All right, we'll do it at the same time. One... two—

::{{d|event|The cellphone explodes in his hand, causing the car spin out like before. However, when Richard tries to get out of the moving vehicle, his seat belt pulls him back in and he is hit by the rocket. He stands up, groans, then runs at the masked man who is going after the president}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Stop! {{d|event|Kisses the terrorist; Beats up the president}} No, wait!

::{{d|event|The other terrorist taps him on the back. Richard turns around, and is punched in the face. He blacks out, returning to the living room}}

:{{d|Richard}}: We need to get this box back to the right person! The president has to be saved! And kissed!

==Darwin's Fantasy==
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Takes the box from Richard}} What if it was just a box?

:{{d|Gumball}}: That would be a huge letdown.

::{{d|event|Whimsical music plays in the background}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Think about it. A cardboard box could be a spaceship. A time-machine. {{d|event|Singing}} ''A pirate boat fighting a giant squid, if you look at it through the eyes of a kid...''

::{{d|event|The camera starts to tilt up, but Gumball intervenes, putting an end to the song}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Angrily}} I said it would be a huge letdown!

:{{d|Darwin}}: I don't care what's inside it, I just want the box.

:{{d|Anais}}: We need to destroy it!

:{{d|Richard}}: No!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I saw it first!

:{{d|Nicole}}: It's mine!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on!

::{{d|event|Shouting indistinctly, the Wattersons fight for the box, and in the process it is thrown through the picture window. Their battle continues outside in the pouring rain, until a flying kick from Nicole sends the parcel onto the street. The family watches from the sidewalk as numerous vehicles pass by. Together, they gasp, then sigh in relief after each near-miss. But just as the traffic clears, a bolt of lighting obliterates the box and its contents and the Wattersons frown}}

==Mystery Solved==
::{{d|event|Eventually, the rain stops, after which someone rings their doorbell. Gumball opens the door, gasps, then runs to give Mr. Robinson a hug}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Hushed}} My favorite.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|Pushes Gumball away}} Have you guys received a package by any chance? I told 'em to leave it here if I wasn't home.

::{{d|event|Gumball is instantly joined by the rest of his family, and they all gasp in unison}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Nervously}} Oh, uh, I don't think so.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Eh, never mind. {{d|event|Walks away}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wait! {{d|event|Grabs his arm}} Maybe we opened it by mistake... What was inside?

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: You don't wanna know.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Trust me, we really do.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Okay, you know that rough skin you have on your elbow? Well imagine that, but a bit scalier, and spreading over your entire... place that should be soft. Now, imagine if that skin also got marinated in vinegar and microwaved, and hair somehow got trapped under a layer of that skin, and the hair kept growing. Under this kinda blister that's sort of filled with some butter-colored oily matter, and then it starting sweating, kinda like cheese, but on live meat, until it hardened into a flaking crust.

::{{d|event|The Wattersons are speechless, sharing a look of revulsion}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Well, the box had some cream in it for that.

:{{d|Gumball}}: You're right, we didn't wanna know.
