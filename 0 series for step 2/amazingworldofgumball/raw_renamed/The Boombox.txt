==Beatbox Message==
::{{d|event|At the playground. Principal Brown approaches Miss Simian.}}
:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Oh Nigel!
:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Oh, hello Miss Simian! Here's that cup of pig sweat you asked for.
:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Sips}} Mmm! My favorite!
:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Now I've been meaning to talk to you about how very ugly you are.
:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Oh really? {{d|event|Giggles}}
:{{d|Principal Brown}}: I used to think that you were just regular ugly. But now that I'm up this close, I see that you're full on mega-gross. Makes me want to kiss you.
::{{d|event|They kiss}}
:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Mmm. You taste like garbage quiche.
:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Strokes hair}} I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. I was distracted by your rancid breath.
::{{d|event|Principal Brown leaves}}
:{{d|Miss Simian}}: So long, sucker!
::{{d|event|It turns out Gumball and Darwin, seated on a bench, are voicing over Principal Brown and Miss Simian respectively}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|As Principal Brown}} Chimpanzee you later!
::{{d|event|They laugh}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Points to Leslie jumping ropes with Penny and Carmen}} Oh! Let's do those guys!
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Voice-over}} He was an ordinary guy who was never good at anything until he found out he could... jump! {{d|event|Mr. Small walks toward the jump-roping students.}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gumball voices over Mr. Small}} I've already lost your brother to jumping. I am not gonna lose you! 
::{{d|event|Gumball Laughs While Darwin Resumes narrating}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: Boom! He had all the talent, but none of the discipline.
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Voices over Leslie}} I'm just the kid from lower east Elmore. I don't know nothin' about jumpin'.
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Voices over Carmen}} Then don't jump, kid, just push the world away.
::{{d|event|Leslie trips over the jump rope}}
::{{d|event|Gumball keeps laughing}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: Jump! Coming soon to a playground near you. Rated PG-13.
:{{d|Leslie}}​​​​: Would you guys quit it? You're throwing me off my game.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, excuse us for trying to add some drama to your life.
::{{d|event|Juke rushes toward Gumball and Darwin}}
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Beatbox sounds}}
::{{d|event|Darwin looks at Gumball}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Shrugs}} Pfft.
::{{d|event|Darwin gets off the bench and faces Juke}}
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Beatbox sounds}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: A wicked chicken wrote a check for a wall?
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Facepalms and makes beatbox sounds}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: You, uh, licked the bricks you didn't fix?
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Beatbox sounds}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, I'll try to say this politely but you're gonna need to read between the lines. Due to personal circumstances I am unable to commit sufficient resources to resolve this communication problem. {{d|event|Subtitled as "Can't be bothered"}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: Hey! Show some understanding. He's doing his best to communicate.
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Beatbox sounds}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: That... just sounded like you said you were running from the butt police.
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Annoyed beatbox sounds}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: I think we need to find out what he wants before he chokes on his tape.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Too late.
::{{d|event|Juke pulls a cassette with exposed tape out of his mouth}}

==Deciphering Beatbox==

::{{d|event|The library. Gumball, Darwin, and Juke are at the computer. Darwin is rewinding Juke's cassette with a pen}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay. I'm gonna use the online translator. So what language do you speak?
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Gives cassette back to Juke}} Come on. At least make an effort to speak to him in a way he can understand. {{d|event|Grabs Juke and enunciates}} What... language... do you speak?!
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Beatbox sounds}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Interrupts Juke}} Uhp! Please try and articulate this time.
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Beatbox sounds}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm gonna type that the way I heard it.
::{{d|event|Gumball runs his hand on keyboard, and hits the enter button. The computer chimes in}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Elmore Search says, "Do you need medical help?" I'm tempted to say yes!
:{{d|Darwin}}: Gumball, you're not being very constructive. {{d|event|Grabs Juke and enunciates}} What... country... do you come from?!
:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry, I got this. {{d|event|Types}} What country do boombox heads come from?
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} Gumball! Uh, uh, what my ignorant friend here is trying to say is, "Where do bi-speakered, parallelepipedic electrical leisure appliances come from?"
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Types}} Ugh, you make it sound like a disease. {{d|event|The computer chimes}} Ah, Boomboxembourg!
::{{d|event|Juke seems to groan}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: That's right, home... where you have over five-hundred different words for disco.
:{{d|Gumball}}: But only discovered fire in 1992.
::{{d|event|Darwin and Juke seem to be annoyed}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, don't blame me! Blame your cavemen.
::{{d|event|Juke swipes the keyboard from Gumball and begins to type}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Of course, why didn't we think of that? You can just write what you want to say.
::{{d|event|The computer chimes. On the screen is "bk bk bpp bkbkbk khhhh"}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: What the? {{d|event|Tries to read the beatbox sounds with spitting, clicking his tongue, and blowing a raspberry in the end}} Dude, you need to type words, not cockroach noises. {{d|event|The computer chimes again}} Hmm, there's no direct translation for this in English. But it will translate into {{d|event|Types}} French, which will translate into Spanish, which will translate into Japanese, which will translate into Swahili, then Chinese, then Indonesian, then Portuguese, then Danish, then back into English, simple. {{d|event|Clicks translate to see results. Right after, he seems shocked when seeing the translation. He reads the message}} "The reign of the ape is no more?" {{d|event|Darwin is now shocked. The two look at each other and smile}}

==Celebration==

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin run out of the library screaming}}
:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: MISS SIMIAN'S RETIRED!!!
::{{d|event|As Darwin leaves the scene, Gumball continues screaming. He tears off his shirt}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh! {{d|event|He takes off Leslie's pot}} Oh! {{d|event|He rips off the hair on the front of Principal Brown's body, groans disgustingly, then puts the fur back on. He leaves the scene}}
::{{d|event|Gumball now meets up with Darwin in the chemistry classroom, where Tobias and the Eggheads are experimenting with special chemicals. Gumball and Darwin continue screaming as they run by, Darwin smashing the vials, leaving a large smokescreen and causing Tobias and the Eggheads to begin coughing. Gumball and Darwin then enter the pool area, where they jump in and run along the bottom, still screaming, then jump out and run off}}
::{{d|event|The living room. Richard is watching TV. We can see the host on a game show with a contestant}}
:{{d|Game Show Host}}: And you've won this amazing, new car!
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin drive the car uncontrollably, crash it, then run away, still screaming. Richard gets frightened, then changes the channel to an airline commercial with a plane}}
:{{d|Announcer}}: Elmore Wings. We may not have the legroom, but there's plenty of seats.
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin now appear on one of the plane's wings, still screaming}}
:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: MISS SIMIAN'S RETIRED!!!
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin then get blown off the wing with the accumulated air entering their heads. Richard changes the channel to a nature documentary with a cheetah running along the grasslands}}
:{{d|Narrator}}: The majestic cheetah; fastest land mammal on Earth. Capable of reaching speeds of up to…oh.
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin flawlessly run past the cheetah, still screaming. Richard turns off the TV}}
:{{d|Richard}}: I think I've finally watched too much TV! Maybe I should read a book. {{d|event|Richard opens a book and begins to read out loud}} "Chapter 1. Gumball and Darwin ran through the living room... screaming"?
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin run through the living room screaming, with Richard screaming from shock}}
::{{d|event|The school entrance. Everyone bursts from the doors, screaming}}
:{{d|All}}: MISS SIMIAN'S RETIRED!!! SCHOOL'S OVER!!!
:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Number One: I have not retired; and number two: if I was retiring, you'd still have to go to school!
:{{d|All}}: Ugh!
:{{d|Miss Simian}}: What are you doing out here?
::{{d|event|Mister Small is shown with a party hat and blower, which he slowly stops blowing}}
:{{d|Mister Small}}​​​​: {{d|event|Awkwardly}} Uhh.. Well... I felt sure it was a fire drill, and I was uh gonna... All you kids back inside, you hear me?!
:{{d|Masami}}: Good job, Watterson. {{d|event|Everyone walks back inside, looking angry}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Curse word. {{d|event|Walks back inside with the others}}
:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Why would anyone think I was retiring?
:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​: Well, you are kind of old... and bald.
:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Bald?! {{d|event|Quickly feels head}}
:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Not bald, my paddle. It's just gravity has turned your hair into a beard.
:{{d|Miss Simian}}: I've got a beard?! Hmm… the only honorable way out of this is to turn my embarrassment into anger. Detention for both of you!
::{{d|event|Mr. Small and Principal Brown sigh}}

== Second Boombox Message ==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are seen walking out of a room, and Gumball slams the door}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: That's the last time I try to help a- {{d|event|Bumps into Juke's face}}
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Beatbox sounds}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gasps, mockingly}} What's that? Little Timmy fell down the well?
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Disagreeing beatbox sounds}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: No? {{d|event|gasps, mockingly}} You found a treasure, and now we can save the town from the evil contractors?
: {{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Facepalms}} {{d|event|Disagreeing beatbox sounds}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: No? Then I suggest that you go to the library and learn some English, dude. 'Cause I'm officially giving up on you.
: {{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Angry beatbox sounds, shaking himself}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Imitates Juke shaking himself}} I don't understand what you're saying!
::{{d|event|Alan appears, and flies to them}}
: {{d|Alan}}​​​​: You know, I speak a little beatbox.
: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sigh}} Of course you do. I bet you learned it while parachuting carbon-neutral aid parcels to orphan polar bears.
: {{d|Alan}}​​​​: {{d|event|Laughs}} No. I just learned some because I wanted to make Juke feel welcome in our school. {{d|event|He proceeds to beatbox by rubbing the wall, and letting out his air}}
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Responds with beatbox sounds}}
: {{d|Darwin}}: What did you say?
: {{d|Alan}}​​​​: I asked the way to the beach, and "how much is this taco?"
: {{d|Gumball}}: What?
: {{d|Alan}}​​​​: I don't know. It's the only words I know how to say. But I think he kept saying "Grobblefest."
: {{d|Darwin}}: Grobblefest? What does that mean?
: {{d|Alan}}​​​​: Well, I could try to-
::{{d|event|Principal Brown passes by, reading a book. His fur attracts Alan, and causes his body to stick to his fur}}
: {{d|Alan}}​​​​: {{d|event|Laughs}} Principal Brown?
: {{d|brown}}: I'm sorry, what? {{d|event|Walks away}}
: {{d|Alan}}​​​​: No, no, I'm- {{d|event|Laughs}} That's what happens when you mess with static! {{d|event|Laughs again}} {{d|event|Sees Principal Brown walking into boy's toilet}} Uh oh no, no, no, no NOOOOOO!!!! {{d|event|Goes to bathroom with principal}}
:{{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Beatbox sounds}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: I'm sorry dude, but I don't understand what you want. Bye!
: {{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Runs to Gumball and Darwin}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} {{d|event|Ties Juke to a pipe}} Stay! {{d|event|Walks away}}
: {{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Sighs}}

==Importance of Grobblefest==
::{{d|event|Back in the library, Darwin searches a computer}}
: {{d|Darwin}}: Ah! Apparently Grobblefest is this huge coming-of-age ritual that's been celebrated by his country for generations.
: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|While reading book}} If its so big, how come I haven't heard of it?
: {{d|Darwin}}: Uh, Mount Everest?
: {{d|Gumball}}: Huh?
: {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Frowning}} The Atlantic Ocean?
: {{d|Gumball}}: What?
: {{d|Darwin}}: Thursday?
: {{d|Gumball}}: You can make up as many words you like, but its not gonna prove whatever point you're trying to make.
: {{d|Darwin}}: But this is what Juke's been wanting us to do the whole time! Celebrate Grobblefest. It's really important to his people. It's a ritual about becoming a man. {{d|event|Gumball yawns}} They love it! It makes them feel like this:
::{{d|event|Clicks on a video of Banana Joe playing air guitar}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: Yeah. Well, this is how much I feel:
::{{d|event|Clicks on a video of a puppy suddenly falling asleep}}
: {{d|Darwin}}: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?! You call Juke a boombox head, you insulted his culture, and when he asked you for some help and understanding, you tie him up to a pipe like a dog! YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE? YOU'RE A BAD FRIEND! Like this guy:
::{{d|event|Clicks on a video entitled "Trust Fail." In the video, a man promises his friend to catch him. But when his friend leans backward and falls, the other becomes distracted with a phone call, and doesn't catch the other guy}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sigh}}
::{{d|event|Clicks on a video that shows a man crying a lot of water. Darwin sees Gumball crying like the man on the video}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: You're right. I'VE BEEN A THUNDERJERK! But don't worry, I'm gonna overcompensate for my guilt in the most extreme way possible! Darwin, bring out those coming-of-age rituals. I'm gonna throw Juke the most hardcore Grobblefest there's ever been!

==Gumball's Grobblefest==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin start the rituals, with Juke at the swimming pool. He is blindfolded}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: Okay, Juke. It's time to swim the lake of boyhood, and emerge... a man. Happy Grobblefest! {{d|event|Pushes Juke into the pool}}
::{{d|event|Juke sinks like a rock. Juke reaches his hand out of the water asking for help, indicating that he is drowning}}
: {{d|Darwin}}: You should be ashamed!
: {{d|Gumball}}: What? This is what I've read on the internet. Besides, we got the stick. We can pull him out, anytime.
: {{d|Darwin}}: It's not that. It's because you're just doing this out of guilt!
: {{d|Gumball}}: Well, why else are you supposed to help people?
: {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Inhales}} Hold this for me, buddy.
::{{d|event|Darwin {{d|event|carrying a stick}} hands it over to the drowning Juke. Juke grabs it, but Darwin lets it go}}
: {{d|Darwin}}: Look. You help someone because you have to show the right example to people.
: {{d|Gumball}}: So, that's what it's all about, huh? {{d|event|Mockingly}} ''Feeling superior.''
: {{d|Darwin}}: It's not about feeling superior! It's about doing the right thing!
: {{d|Gumball}}: Well, you might wanna pull him out then.
::{{d|event|Darwin notices Juke, and starts screaming and running around. In the next scene, Gumball and Darwin force Juke to eat something in their backyard}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: Come on now, buddy! Second part of the ritual! Time to be a man! You don't want to get Grobble-fail? EAT IT, and take its strength!
::{{d|event|He pushes Juke toward a squirrel}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: Come on, man! You can do it! Eat it. Eat it! Come on, you can do it, buddy! You're almost there!
: {{d|Darwin}}: Has it occured to you that maybe you've got this wrong?
: {{d|Gumball}}: Has it occured to you that you might hurt your neck looking down on people all the time? This is the best I can do! You're welcome to go to the zoo, and steal a crocodile if you really want to do it by the book. COME ON, dude. Man up!
::{{d|event|He continues pushing Juke, then stops}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: Alright, I'll show you. What's so hard about this.
::{{d|event|He sees the squirrel's shining eyes smiling}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispers sadly}} Maybe I should send it to sleep first. {{d|event|Sings}} ''Go to sleep, little squirrel.'' {{d|event|Whistles}} {{d|event|Gets bitten by squirrel}}
::{{d|event|The scene skips to them eating burgers in the house}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: Hmm. You know, if you think about it, a cow is better than a squirrel. I mean, it's a pretty powerful animal. If you had the strength of a cow, that'd be pretty hardcore. Okay! Now that your soul is cleansed and your body is full of the sacred power of the cheeseburger, it is time for the ritual GROBBLE-FIGHT!
::{{d|event|They are shown in the backyard, with "weapons" gathered in the middle}}
: {{d|Darwin}}: This is pathetic.
: {{d|Gumball}}: What!? This is perfect!
::{{d|event|The "weapons" are a trash lid, a pair of shoes, and oranges}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: It's just as good as a sword and shield, and a bow and arrow. It's all there in spirit. Okay, let's get started! 3…
::{{d|event|He and Darwin get ready to spring for the weapons, while Juke disapproves and tries to tell them that he does not want a fight}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: 2… 1… Grobble-fight!
::{{d|event|The brothers spring for the weapons. Gumball grabs the bag of oranges, and Darwin defends himself with the trash lid against the barrage of incoming oranges}}
: {{d|Darwin}}: Your making a mockery of his culture- {{d|event|Gets orange in mouth}}
: {{D|Gumball}}: Come on! Make a effort, it's for Juke!
: {{d|Darwin}}: You still don't get it, do you?
: {{d|Gumball}}: Oh, I get it alright. You're a finger-pointer, and now I'm doing the right thing. You can't point your pointy little flipper at me anymore, and that's why you're so butthurt. But the truth is, I'm actually doing something, and you're not helping at all!
: {{d|Darwin}}: I AM helping! {{d|event|Throws lid}}
::{{d|event|Gumball dodges, and throws shoe}}
::{{d|event|Darwin tackles Gumball}}
::{{d|event|The shoe that Gumball throws accidentally hits Juke in the back of his head, and causes a switch to be moved}}
: {{d|Juke}}: OW! Right in the… {{d|event|Gasps}} The switch. You finally flipped the switch! {{d|event|Laughs}} I've been trying to explain this for two years: my arms are too short to reach it!
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin continue fighting}}
: {{d|Juke}}: Guys, guys. You can stop fighting. I appreciate the effort, but I have no idea what this "Grobblefest" thing is. Boomboxembourg is a continent. There's more than one country, you know. Scratchistan, Loopsynberg, Rapia, the Democratic Republic of Rhythm-
: {{d|Gumball}}: Be quiet, Juke! We're trying to help you!
: {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Pulls ears}} Yeah, but you're just helping in a half-baked way to feel better about yourself!
: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gets on top of Darwin}} Hang on! We're both trying to do good here. There's no reason to be fighting!
: {{d|Darwin}}: I agree! I'm sorry for making you feel bad!
: {{d|Gumball}}: And I'm sorry for fighting with you!
: {{d|Darwin}}: Well, you can stop slapping me then.
::{{d|event|They stop fighting, and get up}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: Well, at least we made someone happy today. Happy Grobblefest, Juke!
::{{d|event|They move to embrace him}}
: {{d|Juke}}: Oh NO NO, GUYS WAIT-!
::{{d|event|Gumball's embrace causes him to unintentionally switch Juke's voice from "voice" to "beatbox" again}}
: {{d|Juke}}: {{d|event|Angry beatbox noises}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Look at that. You try and help people, and that's what you get.
::{{d|event|The episode ends with them walking away from a disappointed Juke}}
