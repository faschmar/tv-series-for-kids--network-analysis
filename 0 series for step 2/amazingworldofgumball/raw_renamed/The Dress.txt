==In the Morning==
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Impatient, in front of the door}} Gumball! Darwin! Come on! We're gonna be late for school!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|On the second floor}} Be there in a second!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are on the top of the house stairs, Gumball is naked and both of them are covered with ice cubes}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Excited}} Okay, by my calculations, these ice cubes will allow us to glide down stairs at almost the speed of light. Go!

::{{d|event|They "glide" down the stairs, both getting hurt}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Awesome.

::{{d|event|Both stand up and go to the door with Anais}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ready!

:{{d|Anais}}: You can't go to school like that! You're naked!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Shrugs}} But I can't find my clothes.

==In the Garden==
::{{d|event|Scenes changes to the back garden. Richard is sleeping on the grass}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dad!

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Startled awake}} Morning, son!

:{{d|gumball}}: Why are you sleeping in the garden?

:{{d|richard}}: Because I've been up all night doing the laundry. Just like your mother asked me to.

::{{d|event|Flashback to Nicole and Richard}}

:{{d|nicole}}: Whatever you do, don't do the laundry.

:{{d|richard}}: {{d|event|Salutes}} Aye-aye, Cap'n!

::{{d|event|Back to the present}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Great! Can I have my clothes?

:{{d|richard}}: Of course. {{d|event|Grabs Gumball's pants and sweater off the line. They've shrunk enough to fit in the palms of his hands}} Here you go!

:{{d|gumball}}: They're so tiny.

:{{d|richard}}: {{d|event|Rubbing his face against them}} And so clean.

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Has squeezed into the tiny clothes}} Kind of tight, too. {{d|event|He takes one step, and the clothes immediately tear off him, leaving him naked again}}

:{{d|richard}}: {{d|event|Quickly grabs Gumball and sticks him in his shirt}} Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! You know how your mother feels about public nudity.

==Only Outfit Left==
::{{d|event|Gumball is wearing a Daisy Flakes box; Richard is on a stool picking something from the top of a wardrobe}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Not to worry. I’ve got just the thing.

::{{d|event|Gumball calmly munches flakes from the box he is wearing. The stool turns over and Richard is forced to hang on the wardrobe}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Ah! Oh. Here you go!

:{{d|Gumball}}: What?! Mom’s wedding dress? I can’t wear ''that!''

:{{d|Richard}}: But everything else is in the wash.

:{{d|Gumball}}: I’d rather go naked!

:{{d|Richard}}: But if you do, your mother will know I’m a terrible father/husband! Please, son! {{d|event|Puppy eyes}} Do this for your old dad! {{d|event|Drops a tear}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gives in}} Okay, I’ll wear the dress.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Tear gets sucked back into his eye}} Thanks, son!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I can’t believe this.

:{{d|Richard}}: I can’t believe this wardrobe’s still standing! {{d|event|The wardrobe starts trembling}} Whoa. Here we go! {{d|event|Whimpers}} Aah!

::{{d|event|The wardrobe door opens and throws Richard out of the house window}}

==Waiting for the School Bus==
::{{d|event|Gumball comes out from behind a fire hydrant he has been hiding out to be unnoticed}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Gumball! 

::{{d|event|Gumball shrieks nervously}} 

:{{d|Anais}}: What are you wearing?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Shh! Dad ruined all my clothes and made me wear this stupid dress. I cannot let anyone recognize me.

::{{d|event|Several students approach the bus stop}}

:{{d|Tina}}: Who are you?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gulps, observes his surroundings trying to come up with a fake name}} Uh... my name is... Quick. Think of a name. Think of a name. 

::{{d|event|A truck passes by and it says "Gum"}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Gum...

::{{d|event|A dog spits out a soccer ball}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: ...ball —oops! Uh... 

::{{d|event|An egg takes out of the shell on his head}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Egg...

:{{d|Eggman}}: Morning. 

::{{d|event|Pantsbully is seen riding on a motorcycle}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wobble... 

::{{d|event|Underpants walks by}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: ...Underpants!

:{{d|Underpants}}: Yo.

::{{d|event|Anais facepalms}}

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Is that a foreign name?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yes! Yes! I’m, uh, from, buh-duh-duh... Europe!

:{{d|Tina}}: Where in Europe?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Observing his surroundings again trying to construct the name of the place in the same manner}} Uh... Gum... bald— No! Uh... wig... battle-ax... ninja!

::{{d|event|The school bus arrives and everyone gets into it. Anais for unknown reason stays at the bus stop. Darwin, who stayed too, comes up}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Can you believe that, Darwin?

::{{d|event|Darwin notices a big pink button on the ground and stares at it in amazement}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Darwin?

:{{d|Darwin}}: She dropped her button. {{d|event|Picks up the button and skips down the road}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Oh, boy.

==A Wonderful School Day==
::{{d|event|The bell rings; the scene cuts to Miss Simian's class}}

:{{d|Simian}}: Okay! Okay! Settle down and take out your math homework!

::{{d|event|They take out their homework, except Gumball and Darwin, who is drawing Gumball in the dress like a french girl}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Psst. I forgot to do my homework. Can I copy yours?

::{{d|event|Darwin's eyes become heart-shaped}}

:{{d|Alan}}​​: You can copy mine.

:{{d|Leslie}}​​: No! Mine!

:{{d|Bobert}}: How about mine?

:{{d|Simian}}: {{d|event|Referring to Gumball}} Well, well, well. You are not trying to cheat, are you Gumb— Uh, hmm... {{d|event|Perplexed}} Who are you?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sweating}} I'm, uh— I'm...

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: {{d|event|Raises his hand}} That's Gumball Oops Eggwobble Underpants!

:{{d|Anton}}: From Gumbald Nowig Battle-ax Ninja!

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: {{d|event|Raises her hand}} That's in Europe!

::{{d|event|The whole class starts talking}}

:{{d|Simian}}: Quiet! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! 

::{{d|event|Stares at Gumball and notices the fabulous dress}} 

:{{d|Simian}}: But you're wearing a beautiful dress, so it must be true. Why don't you sit there and look pretty, while the rest of us get on with class.

::{{d|event|The whole class sighs}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Confused}} What just happened?

::{{d|event|The bell rings, class is over, Darwin leaves the classroom quickly}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Dancing, excited}} Whoo-hoo! I'm so happy! Anais!  {{d|event|Runs up to Anais, who is at her locker, and grabs her face}} The most wonderful, incredible, amazing thing has happened!

:{{d|Anais}}: What?

:{{d|Darwin}}: I'm in love! She's the most beautiful, most wonderful, most amazing, most wonderful, most— {{d|event|Gasps then hides behind Anais}} Here she comes.

::{{d|event|Gumball appears walking haughtily, the whole class is surrounding him}}

:{{d|Masami}}: Can I sit next to you?

::{{d|event|There's a puddle a few steps ahead}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: {{d|event|Stops everyone}} Stop! There's a puddle. We can't let you walk through that. {{d|event|Takes his peel off, and puts it on the puddle}} Let me help.

:{{d|Masami}}: No, {{d|event|Makes a little demonstration}} let my fly you over...

:{{d|Clayton}}: {{d|event|Shape-shifts into a bridge}} I can build you a bridge.

:{{d|Tina}}: {{d|event|Steps on Clayton}} No. Let me carry you in my mouth. {{d|event|Opens her mouth, it can be seen that her breath stinks}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh... I can just walk around like this. {{d|event|Does so while saying it}}

:{{d|Tina}}: Oh, she's so clever.

:{{d|Masami}}: So independent!

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: What a free thinker!

::{{d|event|The whole class goes away}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Confused}} What was all that about?

:{{d|Anais}}: It's the dress.

:{{d|Gumball}}: What?!

:{{d|Anais}}: They think you're a beautiful girl. People will do anything for a beautiful girl. ''Anything!''

::{{d|event|Gumball realizes the situation, smiles and goes to Anais' locker to look at the mirror}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: You're right. I am beautiful. 

::{{d|event|He closes the locker, that reveals Darwin hiding behind the locker door. He stands there impressed and holds a camera}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: You really are one smart genius, sis.

::{{d|event|Darwin takes a photo and looks at it: it's Gumball's back}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} She will be mine. {{d|event|Sticks the picture to his face and leaves quickly}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Confused}} That was weird. {{d|event|Shrugs}} Oh, well. Today is gonna be awesome!

::{{d|event|A montage of Gumball's day begins while "Fine Lady" is playing: first Gumball goes to the cafeteria and Rocky gives him roast-beef while Anton and Ocho get meat stew, then the class is going to have a race during P.E., but Gumball's classmates help him winning by carrying him, then Penny places a pair of roller skates near the finish line, and the rest of the students drop Gumball in them and blow a wind in his direction, making him win effortlessly. Darwin catches a towel with which Gumball has wiped his forehead and squeezes his sweat from it, then stores that drop of sweat in a heart-shaped necklace locket}}

::{{d|event|The class carries him to the hallway where Anais stands at her locker again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Thanks, guys!

:{{d|Tobias}}​​: Yeah, no problem.

:{{d|Bobert}}: Anytime.

::{{d|event|The class leaves}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Gumball, what's going on?

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's just like you said. All day long, people have been bending over backwards for me.

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Literally bent over backwards}} Hey, new girl. How's it going?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Ahh. I love being beautiful. You should give it a try.

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|With an "are you kidding me" face}} Darwin asked me to give you this. {{d|event|Gives a note}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Reads the note; it has hearts, flowers and a rainbow drawn on it}} "Meet me at the Stomach Destroyer roller coaster at six o'clock P.M." Then he put three Xs. To show how extreme it'll be!

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Worried}} It's a love letter! He thinks you're a gir— {{d|event|Gumball quiets her}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! You'll give yourself worry lines with all that nagging. Then you'll never be beautiful. Like me. {{d|event|Smiles proudly}}

==The Roller Coaster==
::{{d|event|Gumball gets into a car}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Whoo!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Appears in the car shyly}} She came. She actually came. {{d|event|Tries to touch Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey, you ready, Darwin?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Sweaty and amazed}} She knows my name!

::{{d|event|The ride starts}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: This is gonna be awesome! {{d|event|Excited while the car is going up a looping}} Can't wait. Can't wait. Can't wait. Can't wait.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Doubts}} Uh, I know this is kind of sudden, and I hope you don't think I'm a fool—

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, this is really cool!

:{{d|Darwin}}: But who am I to deny fate?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I know, this is gonna be great!

:{{d|Darwin}}: No, um, what I really mean is...

::{{d|event|The car arrives to the top, it goes slowly}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: What?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} I love you.

::{{d|event|The car goes down quickly, Gumball shouts being terrified of Darwin's words}}

==At Home==
::{{d|event|Anais is holding a photo of Darwin trying to kiss Gumball at the roller coaster}}

:{{d|Anais}}: So, now we see the ''real'' price of beauty.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Holding a pillow}} Oh, he really thinks I'm a girl, and he thinks he loves me. {{d|event|Cover his head with the pillow}}

:{{d|Anais}}: You'll just have to tell him the truth, won't you, beautiful?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Completely under the pillow}} I can't do that! He'll be heartbroken. And besides, he might tell everyone about the dress, and I'll lose my powers. {{d|event|Gets up on the couch, still with the pillow on his head}} But maybe if I keep up the act, then in a few years, Darwin will move on and meet another girl! {{d|event|Smiles}}

:{{d|Anais}}: And if he doesn't?

::{{d|event|Gumball imagines what would happen: Gumball is ironing clothes surrounded by kids that look like Gumball and Darwin}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Opens the door}} I want more kids!

::{{d|event|Gumball cries, both in his imagination and in reality}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Is sitting on the couch}} Hmm? Who's your pretty friend, Anais?

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's me, Dad.

:{{d|Richard}}: Hello, It's Me Dad. Is she foreign?

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Facepalms}} Ugh!

==The Darling of Elmore High Leaves==
::{{d|event|Gumball, Anais and the whole class are at the bus stop}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Holding his arm}} Uh, hi, everyone. Um, this is quite difficult for me to say. But what I'm trying to say is- is... {{d|event|Anais holds a goodbye banner}} I'm leaving.

::{{d|event|Everyone is shocked}}

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: But, why?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Because the king of Europe has been kidnapped? {{d|event|Anais looks at him}} And they need my help 'cause I'm so beautiful.

::{{d|event|Everyone buys it}}

:{{d|Anais}}: You better get on that bus before you blow the whole thing. Now, have you got the balloon?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} Check. {{d|event|Takes out a balloon with his face poorly drawn on it}} This a great idea of yours. Staging a grand farewell for {{d|event|Strikes a pose}} the darling of Elmore High.

:{{d|Anais}}: Remember, this isn't about you.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Hey, everybody!

:{{d|Anais}}: Here he comes! Quick! Get on the bus! 

::{{d|event|Gumball rapidly gets on the bus}} 

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|To herself}} This plan already reeks of failure.

::{{d|event|Darwin comes to the rest of the class, whistling}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|With heart-shaped eyes}} What a perfect new girlfriend day. Just for having a new girlfriend, don't you think, fellas? {{d|event|Sees the banner then gasps}} She's leaving? {{d|event|His heart-shaped eyes break to pieces}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|On the bus, sees Darwin's sadness}} Well, here goes.

::{{d|event|The bus door opens and the balloon with Nicole's dress comes out}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hello, Darwin.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Kneels then gasps}} You get more beautiful every time I see you. But why are you leaving?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm sorry, my love, but Europe needs me.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Then take me with you! A love this special only comes around once in a lifetime. We must nurture it, take care of it, let it grow and blossom, like a-a... a...

:{{d|idaho}}: -a potato?!

:{{d|darwin}}: A potato!

:{{d|gumball}}: You are a true poet, my love. And although we'll never see each other again, my heart and all my other internal organs will always belong to you.

:{{d|rocky}}: All aboard!

:{{d|gumball}}: Uh, I have to go now. Bus is leaving. Bye.

::{{d|event|Gumball opens one of the windows on the other side of the bus, then jumps out naked}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Ow!

::{{d|event|The bus door closes, cutting off the string of the balloon with the dress from the bus, then Darwin and the others watch it fly up. Then the bus leaves}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Uh-oh.

:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Still looking up at the balloon, gasping}} She's an angel.

::{{d|event|The balloon flies up towards the sun}}

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Look out for the sun!

:{{d|Everybody}}: The sun!

::{{d|event|Everyone tries to tell the balloon to evade the sun}}

:{{d|Everybody}}: Go left! Go left!

::{{d|event|...but it doesn't and explodes}}

:{{d|Everybody}}: Oh!

:{{d|Darwin}}: NO! {{d|event|Cries}} Why?! WHY?!

:{{d|Anais}}: Gumball, go to him.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Comforting him}} I'm so sorry, Darwin. She was really special. {{d|event|The balloon falls in his hands, he throws it away}} But think of it this way. It's better to have loved, and watch that love be burnt before your very eyes, than to never have loved at all. So, why don't you and me head home, cover ourselves in ice cubes, and jump from the biggest top of stairs we can find? What do you say, buddy?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Cheers a bit}} Okay.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Whoo-hoo! 

::{{d|event|The dress falls on a fire hydrant}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Goes to the fire hydrant}} Excuse me. I know this is a bit sudden. I mean, we hardly know each other. But I think I love you. {{d|event|Happy then in a whisper voice}} Your silence says a thousand words.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Huh. I guess some people just can't help making fools of themselves.

:{{d|Tina}}: Look. There's Gumball.

:{{d|Masami}}: And he's naked!

::{{d|event|Everyone laughs at him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ugh! Don't mock me! {{d|event|Sobbing}} I used to be beautiful. {{d|event|Goes away}}

::{{d|event|Darwin hugs the fire hydrant as Gumball walks past, Darwin's eyes are heart shaped again. Episode ends}}
