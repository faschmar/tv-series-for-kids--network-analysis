==Going to School==
::{{d|event|The episode begins with Nicole and her kids speeding along a highway. In the car, the kids are trying to perform their morning chores; Gumball trying to apply toothpaste on his toothbrush; Anais trying to pour a cup of orange juice; Darwin trying to pour cereal into a bowl. Finally, they manage it}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, and {{d|Anais}}: Ah.

:{{d|Anais}}: That's better.

::{{d|event|Nicole's car then stops hurriedly, causing their food to splatter the windshield. It is then shown in a traffic jam}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Come on, we're going to be late.

::{{d|event|Nicole gets out of the car begins jumping car over car to hurry her kids to school}}

:{{d|Pantsbully}}: Hey, are you crazy, you dumb-

::{{d|event|Nicole shows her fiery eyes at him, causing him to break into a little tune and afterwards cry}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: We need a shortcut.

::{{d|event|The next scene shows the bank area, with police outside waiting for an expected thief}}

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Put your hands on your head and come out of the building!

::{{d|event|Someone tries to open the bank doors, however it would not budge}}

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Sorry, I meant: come out of the building and put your hands on your head!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Get out of my way, we're late for school!

::{{d|event|The bank entrance explodes, with Nicole rushing by at break-neck speed. Nicole brings the bank robbers to the police}}

:{{D|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Hey, Mrs. Watterson, what about the- {{D|event|A bag of money hits him}} Money...

::{{d|event|The kids reach the school right as the bell rings}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Mouthing}} Have a nice day!

:{{d|Gumball}}: What?

:{{d|Anais}}: We traveled faster than speed of sound, give it a second.

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Voice}} Have a nice day!

:{{d|Anais}}: There you go.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Heh, thanks, Mom.

::{{d|event|The kids stumble up the stairs, as if they twisted their legs}}

==Strange Encounter==
::{{d|event|Behind her, stands a tall and slim figure. It greets Nicole}}

:{{d|Yuki}}: Hello, Nicole. I've waited a long time for this.

::{{d|event|Nicole focuses on the slim object}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: I'm sorry, I really can't see you. Could you just, take a step forward?

::{{d|event|The slim object sighs and takes a step forward, revealing herself}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{D|event|Gasps}} Yuki?

:{{d|Yuki}}: Yes, Nicole, I have returned. TO FIGHT!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ok, everybody leave or cover your eyes! This scene is gonna be rated "R" for abundance of outrageous gore!

::{{d|event|Students walk away or enter the building; The kids watch behind the school door; Nicole walks towards Yuki}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: I'm sorry, Yuki, you win. I don't want any trouble.

::{{d|event|Nicole offers her right hand in goodwill, which Yuki slaps away}}

:{{d|Yuki}}: You're not half the person I used to know. Your butt, on the other hand, is twice the size!

::{{d|event|Nicole sticks her bottom out and stares}}

:{{d|Anais}}: O-M-G. She just called mom fat.

::{{d|event|The three cover each others eyes; Nicole takes a deep breath in}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: It was nice seeing you, Yuki.

::{{d|event|Nicole walks away}}

:{{d|Yuki}}: COWARD! Where is your honor?! FIGHT ME! FIGHT ME!

:{{d|Gumball}}: What the actual what?

::{{d|event|School bell rings}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I can't believe Mrs. Mom just walked away!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Maybe she walked to that woman's house and ate her pets!

:{{d|Anais}}: No, that was weird. She looked like she'd seen a ghost. Maybe Mom is... afraid.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hm, weird. I never thought I would hear the word "mom" and "afraid" in the same sentence.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Unless, the sentence was "I'm really afraid of your Mom."

:{{d|Anais}}: Or, "You should be afraid of our Mom."

:{{d|Gumball}}: Or, "The test results just came back, I'm afraid your Mom isn't 90% water, she's 90% anger." {{d|event|to Nicole}} Uh, so what happened?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, it was nothing. Just an old-school friend.

::{{d|event|Cut to a view outside the car, which is damaged; the word "COWARD" is spraypainted across the side of the car}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I meant, what happened to the car?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, that?

::{{d|event|Nicole flashbacks, showing Yuki repeatedly smashing various parts of Nicole's car}}

:{{d|Yuki}}: {{d|event|in flashback}} FIGHT ME! COWARD! ''FIGHT ME!''

::{{d|event|End flashback}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, it's just a scratch. Seatbelts, please.

::{{d|event|The kids buckle themselves in}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Here we go.

::{{d|event|Due to the damage Yuki has made, the car moves slowly. Scene changes to the shopping district supermarket. Nicole sighs; Richard tries to cheer Nicole up by putting various vegetables all over his head}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Nicole? {{d|e|with carrot teeth}} I think we need better toothpaste. {{D|event|Nicole looks at him}} What? {{d|e|with broccoli hair}} Is there something wrong with my hair? {{d|e|with a pumpkin hat}} Do I look better with a hat? {{d|e|with a cucumber slice eyes}} It goes really well with my eyes.

::{{d|event|The whole family laughs}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Come on, you. {{D|event|Richard hugs Nicole}} What's wrong?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Nothing.

:{{d|Richard}}: Good, you keep smiling, or I'll have to use my secret weapon.

:{{D|Nicole}}: What's that?

:{{D|Richard}}: {{D|event|Has melons on his butt and bangs them}} Butt, butt, butt, butt, butt-butt! Butt, butt, butt, butt, butt-butt!

::{{D|event|The whole family laughs but then Yuki shows up}}

:{{D|Yuki}}: What is so funny?

:{{D|Richard}}: {{D|event|Gasps; all the vegetables come off him, One of the vegetables knock out Gary in the background}} Yuki Yoshida!

:{{D|Yuki}}: Hello, Richard. {{D|event|Walks towards Richard}} You look more handsome then ever. What's your secret?

:{{D|Richard}}: Uh, I got old and fatt...er.

:{{D|Yuki}}: What's a man like you, doing with a woman like her?

:{{D|Richard}}: Shh! I don't think she knows she could do better.

:{{D|Yuki}}: {{D|event|Laughs}} Oh, Richard, you always were so funny. And doughy. {{D|event|Squeezes his arm}}

::{{D|event|Nicole growls}}

::{{D|event|Richard tries to escape from Yuki but kicks her legs up stopping him}}

:{{D|Yuki}}: Somebody pinch me, I must be dreaming. {{D|event|Anais punches Yuki}} Ow!

:{{D|Anais}}: Oh, sorry, I thought you said "punch," not "pinch."

:{{D|Nicole}}: There is no point, Yuki. I refuse to fight you.

:{{D|Yuki}}: What kind of woman would do nothing in the face of such dishonor?! {{D|event|Nicole and Yuki glare at each other}}

:{{D|Masami}}: Mom? Can we go, please?

::{{D|event|Yuki scoffs and walks away. She then flips a shopping cart}}

:{{D|Crocodile Woman}}: That was mine! {{D|event|Yuki glares at her}} Never mind.

::{{D|event|Scene changes to the Rainbow Factory, where Nicole is about to go to her desk but Yuki is already there}}

:{{D|Yuki}}: My husband owns this factory, so this is my spot now. Yours is over there. {{D|event|Points with her legs to small squished desk}}

::{{D|event|Nicole goes to the small desk and sighs. Yuki then starts taunting Nicole at work. Yuki ruins her lunch and coffee breaks. Nicole goes to her locker and sees gum when she's trying to open it}}

:{{D|Nicole}}: To be honest, compared to the rest of the stuff you've been doing, this is pretty tame. {{D|event|Nicole opens her locker, only to find out it's covered in gum}} Ugh!

::{{D|event|Nicole runs to the elevator but Yuki closes it. Nicole is about to take the stairs but Yuki opens the elevator. Nicole runs to it again but Yuki closes it. It opens again and Nicole goes in but Yuki presses all the buttons}}

:{{D|Nicole}}: Oh, come on-

::{{D|event|Nicole walks home. In front of the house, the word "COWARD" is spelled out with fire. Nicole enters the house and body slams herself on the sofa. The kids look at her and back at each other, with pity. Scene changes to school as the bell rings}}

==Backstory==
::{{D|event|Gumball and Darwin stammer as they try to come up with something to say; they then look to Anais}}

:{{D|Anais}}: Sorry, guys. I don't know what's going on with Mom and this woman, either.

::{{D|event|Masami appears behind them}}
:{{D|Masami}}: I do.
::{{D|event|They all look at Masami}}
:{{D|Masami}}: They have history. Once upon a time, Nicole and my mother were friends, studying Karate under my grandfather. Separately, they were strong, but together, there was nothing they could not do. Until the Elmore Kumite, a ruthless martial arts tournament, Nicole was mother's kohai, her protégé. But as the tournament progressed, they had to face each other in the final fight. My mother should have won easily, but your mother's fighting spirit allowed her to triumph. Dishonored before her sensei, my mother left America in shame. Nicole gave up the way of the Bushido out of sadness for losing her friend. Back in Japan, my mother trained all these years for her next fight, and now she's back to regain her honor.

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|event|Narrating}} But mother will not accept this fight.

:{{D|Darwin}}: Her heart is too pure to hurt a friend.

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{D|event|Anais and Masami look at them}} Her soul is too noble.

:{{D|Anais}}: Can you stop that, please?!

:{{D|Gumball}} and {{D|Darwin}}: Sorry.

:{{D|Anais}}: They're right, though. Mom won't fight a friend.

:{{D|Masami}}: She may not have a choice. {{D|event|Hands them a letter}}

::{{D|event|Back at the Wattersons' house, Nicole reads a note, crumples it up and throws it on the floor. She then heads towards the door}}

:{{D|Nicole}}: Your mother has to take care of some unfinished business. Don't follow me. It's too dangerous. There's leftover ham in the fridge and some tater tots in the oven. Do not microwave them. They'll go soggy! {{D|event|Slams the door}}

:{{D|Anais}}: {{D|event|Uncrumples the note on the floor and reads it. Anais gasps}} Yuki threatened to get Mom fired and lose the house unless she fights! We've got to stop them!

==Anime-Styled Fight==
::{{D|event|Scene changes to the gym; Yuki is on the floor and Nicole comes in. Nicole and Yuki start to fight in an anime-styled battle. Masami is already there while the kids enter}}

:{{D|Masami}}: What took you guys so long?

:{{D|Darwin}}: {{D|event|Exhausted}} Takes ages... to get anywhere... on these legs.

:{{D|Gumball}}: Are you also here to stop the fight?

:{{D|Masami}}: Yeah, but then I realized I'd probably get annihilated trying. So... {{D|event|Grabs some popcorn. The three then faint.}}

::{{D|event|Nicole and Yuki still fighting}}

:{{D|Yuki}}: You fought well, Nicole-san, but I've been training my whole life for this moment. Let me show you what I've learned.

::{{D|event|Yuki attacks Nicole with an energy blast}}

:{{D|Yuki}}: Yah! {{D|event|Nicole blocks it}} Impossible! How!?

:{{D|Nicole}}: I have been through the most grueling training on the planet.

:{{D|Yuki}}: Which school taught you? Was it Hokuto? Was it Konoha? Or was it... Mr. Miyagi?

:{{D|Nicole}}: No, it was the school of life. I have raised three kids and one husband. {{D|event|Nicole gets angry and starts attacking Yuki}}

::{{D|event|Yuki fights back as the kids watch them; Nicole manages to beat Yuki as she falls to the ground; Nicole stares at her and Yuki gets scared; Nicole reaches her hand out}}

:{{D|Nicole}}: Let's just be friends.

:{{D|Yuki}}: {{D|event|Yuki gets angry and tries to attack Nicole}} I don't need your pity!

::{{D|event|Nicole dodges Yuki's energy blast causing the roof to collapse on the kids; They all scream, while Yuki and Nicole run to them}}

:{{D|Nicole}}: Kids! It's gonna collapse! Aah!

:{{D|Yuki}}: {{D|event|Tries lifting a bar of metal to save them}} I can't do it!

:{{D|Nicole}}: But, together, we can!

::{{D|Both}}: {{D|event|Yuki and Nicole karate chop the piece of metal}} Hyah!

::{{D|event|They both grab the kids and run out of the gym}}

:{{D|Nicole}}: Come on!

::{{D|event|They're all out of the gym and the kids make horrified faces}}

==Reconcile==

:{{D|Yuki}}: I'm sorry, Nicole. I was just... jealous. {{D|event|Yuki starts crying}}

:{{D|Nicole}}: Well, you shouldn't be. You always had the best hair and house and car and butler and ponies and pony butlers.

:{{D|Yuki}}: I can't believe I tried to annihilate you.

:{{D|Nicole}}: I tried to annihilate you first. Don't worry about it.

::{{D|event|Nicole and Yuki hug while sobbing}}

:{{D|Nicole}}: I missed you!

:{{D|Yuki}}: I missed you, too!

::{{D|event|They wipe away their tears}}

:{{D|Yuki}}: {{D|event|Sighs}} Come on, guys.

:{{D|Nicole}}: Let's go home.

::{{D|event|The kids gasp and get scared}}

:{{D|Yuki}}: Oh, please! It was just a little argument between friends.

:{{D|Nicole}}: Yeah, no harm done.

::{{D|event|Nicole and Yuki take their kids and hop home}}

::{{D|event|Episode ends}}
