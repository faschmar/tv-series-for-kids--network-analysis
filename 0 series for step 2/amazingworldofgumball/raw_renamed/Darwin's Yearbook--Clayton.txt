::{{d|e|The episode opens with Darwin on his laptop}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: So, Clayton! He's pretty photogenic. Let's have a look. {{d|e|Clicks on Clayton's profile}}

::{{d|e|All the photos on the profile are of Clayton in a different shape}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh, I didn't think this through. Clayton's a shape-shifter. Maybe one of his friends can help. {{d|e|Clicks on Tobias' profile}} {{d|e|texting}} Hey, Tobias?

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting}} What's up, Darwinkle?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} I'm just making the front cover of the yearbook, and I can't find a good pic of Clayton.

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting}} Don't stress, I'm on it.

::{{d|e|Tobias sends a picture of himself}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} Yeah...do you have one when he looks like Clayton?

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting}} Right, right, I get it, it'd be weird to have me on the cover twice!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} Yeah, the thing is...

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting}} You could have a front ''and'' a back view though. {{d|e|Sends another picture of himself with his back facing the camera}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} Um, this is awkward...

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting}} Or even a side view? {{d|e|Sends yet another picture}} I look great in profile.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} You're not on the cover.

::{{d|e|Tobias is shown to be typing for a while}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} Tobias? Uh, Tobias? Are you—

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​: {{d|e|in large, red font}} WHAT! {{d|e|texting}} Sorry, I couldn't work out how to make the font big. HOW AM I NOT ON THE COVER?!! I'm the complete package. We've been over this, remember?

::{{d|e|A flashback to a scene from "The Third" begins}}

:{{d|Tobias}}: {{d|event|Overlooking from the next stall}} Hey, you guys! I couldn't help, uh, ''listening'' to everything you just said, and I... uh... think you're in luck. Athletic? Check! {{d|event|Showing off}} Rich? Check! {{d|event|Shows some notes}} Colourful? {{d|event|Changes color}} ''Check-a-leck-a-ding-dong''.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} But Clayton can shape-shift!

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting}} Yeah, only because he's too boring to be himself. He doesn't even have any videos of himself showing off online, and everyone knows that's the true sign of coolness.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} Yeah, I'm looking at yours now. What's "Where there's a Wilson there's a way"?

::{{d|e|Darwin clicks on the video and a clip from "The Tape" begins playing}}

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​: {{d|event|Turns to face the camera}} Hi, I'm Tobias Wilson, and a lot of people ask me, "Can you teach me to be as cool as you?" {{d|event|Shakes his head and deepens voice}} And I say, "No, you'll never be as cool as me." {{d|event|Voice goes back to normal}} But I can teach you to be cooler than you, {{d|event|Crosses arms}} and maybe you'll be a hit with the ladies like ''me''.

::{{d|event|Cut to Tobias at the gym with weights in front of him}}

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​: BOOOYAH!! If you wanna get dates.. you gotta pump weights, 'cause girls can't deny.. a guy who's ''this'' fly. So let's get some muscles and score some girls from...like, Brussels!... or...something. Let's do this!

::{{d|event|Tobias grabs weights and cannot lift them. The scene jump cuts to Tobias lifting a smaller weight}}

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Drops weight}} Yeah!! That's what I'm talkin' about!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} I just think Clayton has a more bouncy personality. Literally.

::{{d|e|A clip from "The Anybody" begins playing}}

:{{d|Clayton}}: This was such a good idea! Wahoo!

::{{d|e|He bounces away}}

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting}} Yeah, but is he funny? Check out when I punk'd my dad.

:: {{d|e|Darwin clicks on a video titled "PUNK'D," and a clip from "The Uploads" begins playing}}

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​: Okay, it's five A.M., and my dad is about to get up for work. But I put a skateboard at the bottom of the stairs. Shh! Let's see what happens.

::{{d|event|Harold walks down the stairs and trips and falls on the skateboard, waking up Jackie in the process. Harold sees Tobias and immediately thinks he is being robbed}}

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​: What the...?

:{{d|Harold}}​​​​​​​​​: Aah! Honey! We're being robbed!

::{{d|event|Jackie screams and at the same time an alarm starts blaring. Harold calls the police while Jackie throws objects at Tobias}}

:{{d|Harold}}​​​​​​​​​: Hello, police! We have an intruder! Yes! He's probably armed and dangerous, and he's wearing a rap-music hat.

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​: Guys, guys, it's me! This is a prank. You just got Tobias'd. This is extreme pranking with Tobias Wil— {{d|event|The Doughnut Sheriff busts the door down and tackles Tobias while sirens go off outside}}

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|e|laughs}} {{d|e|texting, in fancy voice}} Is that not funny, kind sir?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} Correct. It is not funny.

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting, in normal voice}} Okay then, I'll show you funny.

::{{d|e|Tobias sends a video. Darwin clicks on it and a compilation of Tobias insulting people}}

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|e|to Gumball}} Your belly has more folds than an origami convention. The only thing you could lift with that body is my self-esteem. You beef-witted peasant! Cantankerous oaf! {{d|e|To Bobert}} Robo-dork! {{d|e|To Idaho}} Rustic troglodyte! {{d|e|To Gumball and Darwin}} Pungent potpourri punks! Weirdos! {{d|e|Laughing at Gumball and Darwin with Banana Joe and Ocho}} BURN!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} Tobias, being mean is not cool.

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting}} Come on, I'm the King of Cool! Who else in Elmore has held a legendary house party?

::{{d|e|A clip from "The Party" begins playing}}

: {{d|Rachel}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​: TOBIAS! More of your dweeb loser baby friends have arrived. {{d|event|Walks back into the house}}

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​: GUYS! GUYS! This party is totally off the ''hook!''

::{{d|event|Everyone screams and violently smashes things. Rob and Tobias have lamp shades on their heads and  they are switching them on and off, Alan attempts to fit himself in with some other balloons, Leslie is dancing with his pot on his head, and Sussie is still eating chips}}

:{{d|Jamie}}: Hey, look! I'm gonna throw the TV out of the window!

:{{d|TV}}: Please, allow me. {{d|event|Jumps out of the window}}

:{{d|Rachel}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: NO! Not the TV!!!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} Yeah, I've been meaning to ask—what happened to your sister Rachel?

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting}} Oh, she's gone.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|texting}} Gone? Like, gone the way of the dinosaur?

:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|e|texting}} No, gone to college, obviously. Anyway, cool party, right? You want more cool—here's a little thing I've been working on.
::{{d|e|Tobias sends another video, which Darwin clicks. A compilation of Tobias being "cool" begins playing}}
:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​: Start the b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b...  It's my chick-magnet dance move. ...what's happenin' Dar-wizzle?  Hey Idaho, my bro-tato.
:
:{{dialogue|idaho}}: Aah!
:
:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​: Alan, my man! Yeah! Well, Where'd you think I got my muscles from? ...kiss it. ...kiss it. ...kiss it. WOOO! Okay, I'm gonna bounce. I've got gals in different locales! Hey, girl. Hey, girl. Hey, girl. Masami went to me this morning: she would like this... Ladies, the equator called! It wants his hotness back. From me. 
::{{d|event|The video stops}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: Hmmm. {{d|event|texting}} I guess you are kinda cool.
:
:{{d|Tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|texting}} AND fun. remember that Portal gun!
::{{d|e|A clip from "The Points" begins playing}}
:{{dialogue|tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​: You think you can outrun me? Well, try to outrun my portal gun. {{dialogue|event|Switches between guns}} Darn, missed it. Gotta cycle through again.
::{{dialogue|event|Tobias switches to his portal gun, then shoots a portal above Gumball and another one underneath him, causing him to fall through an infinite loop}}
:{{dialogue|gumball}}: Darwin!
::{{d|event|Darwin and Tobias fight for the gun, sending Gumball flying in various directions until he bumps into them}}
:{{dialogue|darwin}}: Quick! His parents are only two blocks down!
:
:{{dialogue|tobias}}​​​​​​​​​​: It'll look much further after I've used my shrink gun.
::{{dialogue|event|Tobias shoots, causing Gumball and Darwin to scream as they shrink. He then prepares to stomp them, but is interrupted by a confused Anais}}
:{{dialogue|anais|Tobias shoots, causing Gumball and Darwin to scream as they shrink. He then prepares to stomp them, but is interrupted by a confused Anais}}: What are you doing?
::{{dialogue|event|The clip stops}}
:{{dialogue|tobias|The clip stops}}​​​​​​​​​​: {{dialogue|event|texting}} I mean look at that - I'm like the Fourth Watterson! Me and my bro Gumball are close... really, really close.
::{{d|e|A clip from "The Society" begins playing}}
:{{dialogue|e|The school bell rings, and Tobias is seen walking in the hall. Unknown to him, Gumball is hiding behind him, with his feet in Tobias' shoes. Tobias looks around and suspects something, then shrugs and continues walking. At P.E., Tobias has a hard time doing pushups and pull-ups. He weighs himself in the locker room, and is shocked to see his weight at a whopping 180 pounds. He frowns, squeezes his belly, and scratches his head with Gumball's arm. Later, he plods up to his locker sweating and panting.}}
:
:{{dialogue|darwin}}: {{dialogue|e|To Gumball}} Dude, seriously? Come on.
:
:{{dialogue|tobias|The clip stops}}​​​​​​​​​: I'm sorry, man. I just feel really slow and heavy.
:
:{{dialogue|gumball}}: {{dialogue|e|Whispers to Darwin}} He's gonna lead us straight to them.
:
:{{dialogue|tobias|The clip stops}}​​​​​​​​​: I'm losing my mind! I'm hearing voices, and I'm sweating like a pig!
:
:{{dialogue|gumball}}: Here! {{dialogue|e|Hands Tobias body spray}}
:
:{{dialogue|tobias|The clip stops}}​​​​​​​​​: {{dialogue|e|Sprays himself and Gumball}} Wait! It was you all along!?
::{{dialogue|e|Gumball sneezes, and knocks Tobias out cold. The clip stops}}
:​​​​​{{dialogue|tobias|The clip stops}}​​​​​​​​​: {{dialogue|event|texting}} And remember the time I was stuck on the roof with him?
:
:{{dialogue|darwin}}: {{dialogue|event|texting}} No, I wasn't there.
:
:{{dialogue|tobias|The clip stops}}​​​​​​​​​: {{dialogue|event|texting}} Oh, it was great!
