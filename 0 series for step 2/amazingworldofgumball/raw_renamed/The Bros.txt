==School Bus, on the Way Home==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are shown sitting together on the school bus, heading home}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|To Darwin}} What's your best dance move?

::{{d|event|Darwin does his best dance move, sliding from side to side in his seat}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What's yours?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Cossack dance, but there's a problem with it.

:{{d|Darwin}}: What?

::{{d|event|Gumball gets off of his seat, and dances. He repeatedly kicks himself in the face as he does so}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: My torso's too short.

::{{d|event|They both laugh. Gumball goes back to his seat}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What's your best face?

::{{d|event|Gumball does his best face. He pulls his eyes (literally) forward}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: What's yours?

::{{d|event|Darwin makes an old man face. They laugh again. The bus stops, and Penny gets off}}

:{{d|Penny}}: Thanks!

::{{d|event|Gumball sees Penny, and they stare at each other affectionately}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} And what's your best party trick?

::{{d|event|Gumball sticks his finger into a nostril and it comes out through his ear. He wiggles it around, flapping his ear in the process. Penny giggles and walks off}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Nasally}} Oh, by the way. {{d|event|Normal voice}} There's something very personal I wanted to ask you. If you had to do something really, really special for someone really, really important, what would be the best place ever?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Inhales deeply}} It would be a log cabin.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yes! By a blue lake.

::{{d|event|They squeal like girls}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: And there would be fireflies!

:{{d|Darwin}}: And mason jars!

::{{d|event|They squeal again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: What else?

:{{d|Darwin}}: A fireplace!

:{{d|Gumball}}: A bearskin rug!

:{{d|Darwin}}: A chocolate fountain!

:{{d|Gumball}}: And R&B music!

::{{d|event|They squeal with a very high pitch, so high that their squealing destroys the windows of the nearby cars that the bus passes by. They start dancing slowly and imitating R&B music. Tobias and Banana Joe stare at them, disturbed. Gumball and Darwin notice, and stop dancing by rewinding their moves}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: So, who would you invite?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Never you mind!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, come on! Tell me!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Blushes}} No, you first!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, fine. {{d|event|Sing-song voice}} But you gotta say yours at the same time. On three. One. Two. Three. 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Penny!

:{{d|Darwin}}: You!

::{{d|event|They are both surprised. Darwin is angry and Gumball is shocked}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: What?!

::{{d|event|The bus stops, and the brothers get off}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I AM NOT MAKING A SCENE!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay.

:{{d|Darwin}}: AND I'M NOT JEALOUS OF PENNY!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, don't freak out. There's enough space in my life for the both of you.

::{{d|event|Many Darwins appear around Gumball, crowding him}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: She's crowding us!

:{{d|Darwin}}: She's suffocating us!

:{{d|Darwin}}: She's oppressing us!

:{{d|darwin}}: She's smothering us!

::{{d|event|They all speak at once, disappearing as Gumball interjects}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, enough! I wanted your opinion on something important, but if it's gonna be like this, then just go home! I need to go to the store anyway. {{d|event|Walks off}} 

::{{d|event|Darwin's anger turns into sadness, and he begins to sob. Suddenly, he becomes angry again}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: BACK OFF, PENNY FITZGERALD! HE'S MY BROTHER FROM ANOTHER MOTHER!

==Stalking Penny==
::{{d|event|The bell rings at Elmore Junior High. In a mirror on her locker door, Penny checks her face. Darwin hides behind a corner, spying on her. She sees him in the mirror and turns around. Darwin quickly hides}}

:{{d|Penny}}: Hm?

::{{d|event|She turns back to the mirror}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} I'm gonna dig some dirt on you, and expose you as the treacherous bro thief you are!

::{{d|event|Darwin stretches his eyes and navigates them around Penny. They watch her from above. Penny soon notices them}}

:{{d|Penny}}: Oh hi, Darwin.

::{{d|event|Darwin screams and runs off, bumping into Carmen. Pulling his eyes back to normal, he runs to the end of a hallway. Seeing no way out, he just stands in the corner}}

:{{d|Penny}}: Bye… Darwin?

::{{d|event|Later, Penny and Carmen enter the cheerleaders' dressing room, talking}}

:{{d|Penny}}: …made these funny faces at me through the window of the bus and— Oh, hi Darwin.

::{{d|event|All the girls except Penny and Carmen gasp at Darwin, who is up in the ceiling, holding onto two beams. He falls down, runs to an open locker, and applies makeup on his face in an attempt to disguise himself as a girl. Certain that it is not working, he grabs a bottle of powder from Carrie and throws it to the ground, where it explodes into a cloud. As the girls cough, he escapes}}

:{{d|Penny}}: {{d|event|Coughing}} Bye, Darwin.

::{{d|event|Even later, Sussie and Penny are sitting on a bench in the schoolyard. From behind a dumpster, Darwin uses a listening device to eavesdrop on Penny}}

:{{d|Penny}}: Here, Sussie. I know how much you love chicken skin, so I saved some from last night's dinner.

:{{d|Sussie}}: SUSSIE LOVES CHICKEN SKIN!

::{{d|event|She grabs some and rubs it all over her head, screaming and laughing loudly. The noise makes Darwin shatter to pieces. Penny and Sussie notice him and walk over}}

:{{d|Penny}}: Hi, Darwin.

::{{d|event|The pieces of Darwin scream, sprout legs, and flee}}

:{{d|Penny}}: Aaaand... bye, Darwin.

:{{d|Sussie}}: CHICKEN!

::{{d|event|Penny yelps, startled}}

::{{d|event|The bell rings. In class, Penny writes on a piece of paper while humming. She grabs her bag to put a book in it. Opening it, she gets startled to find Darwin inside, reading her diary}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hi, Penny. Nice, um... diary.

:{{d|Penny}}: Hey, how about you come to lunch with me and Gumball, seems like maybe you wanna talk, right? {{d|event|Closes bag with him still inside}} Right. {{d|event|Walks off}}

==A Nice Lunch==
::{{d|event|In the cafeteria, Gumball has arranged a table for Penny and himself. He takes out a small box, which inside holds a ring. He plans to propose to Penny, but is still deciding on how}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Mumbling}} Ha ha. Uh, what was that? Yeah, I know. We got so much in common. {{d|event|Proposes quickly and intensely}} BE MY WIFE! Ugh, it's not special enough. 

::{{d|event|Gumball takes a deep breath and tries proposing with the ring box on his tongue}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mawwy me. Still not wight.

::{{d|event|Gumball takes the box off of his tongue and sighs}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} I just want it to be perfect.

::{{d|event|Gumball starts imagining himself and Penny in a log cabin with fireflies, a bear skin rug, a fireplace, a chocolate fountain and R&B music playing. They're both having a good time, laughing}}

:{{d|Penny}}: Ah. This is perfect, Gumball.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Not quite yet, sugar. But it will be...

::{{d|event|The space background appears and Gumball opens the box with the ring in it}}

:{{d|gumball}}: ...When you say "yes."

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Appearing similar to Penny}} What?

::{{d|event|Gumball snaps out of his fantasy and yelps}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aah! What are you doing here?!

:{{d|Penny}}: I invited him. {{d|event|Kisses Gumball}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Gasps and kisses Gumball back}} I don't need an invite!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, loud.

::{{d|event|Gumball puts his arm around Penny. Darwin grabs Gumball's other arm, and puts it around himself. Awkwardly, they inch themselves toward the table}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry, I didn't know you were coming so there's only two plates. 

::{{d|event|Darwin grabs the plate of spaghetti that was intended for Gumball}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, can I use my hand at least? 

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Hisses}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Never mind.

:{{d|Penny}}: So, uh, Darwin, I hope you don't feel… threatened by me, do you?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Laughs loudly and sarcastically}} No.

:{{d|Penny}}: Okay, good. Enjoy your food.

::{{d|event|They all begin eating. Gumball and Penny share a plate of spaghetti and begin eating the same strand. Romantic music is playing, and a kiss is imminent. The moment is cut short when it is revealed Darwin has started eating the middle of the strand, preventing the couple from kissing. They tug on the spaghetti strand trying to shake Darwin off, but it only causes all three of them to headbutt eachother. They all fall to the floor}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Shouting}} Dude, what is wrong with you?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Nothing, I'm fine! See you later. {{d|event|Walks off}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, now that we're alo—

::{{d|event|Darwin rushes back to Gumball, and kisses him on the cheek, before rushing away again. After Darwin flees, the couple hold hands and move closer to each other}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Now that we're alone, there's something I wanted to ask you.

:{{d|Penny}}: What is it?

::{{d|event|Darwin walks back to the couple and wedges himself between them}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Actually, I'm gonna stay.

==Basketball==
::{{d|event|In the gym, Coach tries and fails to whistle with her fingers}}

:{{d|Coach}}: Okay, now pick your teams!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Tobias start picking, with Gumball choosing first. In the group of students, Darwin tries to get Gumball to pick him by blowing a vuvuzela and waving around two lit flares, all while jumping up and down. Gumball looks at Penny, and she gestures to Darwin. Gumball sighs, and chooses him}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Who? Me? Oh! In your face!

::{{d|event|Darwin dances and sings around Penny in a mocking manner. Finishing, he runs to Gumball's side. Gumball facepalms. The match begins, with Coach throwing the ball up, still unable to whistle. Gumball taps it towards Penny}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Penny!

::{{d|event|Penny catches the ball, and is about to shoot when suddenly Darwin blocks her. In a montage, he repeatedly intercepts the ball from her, roaring. At one point he even knocks over a cup of water she is drinking. At the end of the match, he flexes his muscles and roars}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Raaaaaahhh! Defense! {{d|event|Stomps twice}} Defense!

::{{d|event|Gumball, holding the hand of a hurt Penny, walks up to him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: DARWIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Throws the ball at Gumball}} Playing ball!

:{{d|Gumball}}: She's on our team, man! You're out!

::{{d|event|He throws the ball back to Darwin. Darwin's head (and thus body) is replaced with the basketball}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Muffled}} Fine! Suit yourself.

::{{d|event|Darwin runs off, and Penny sighs}}

==Need Some Space==
::{{d|event|In the library, Gumball once again tries to propose to Penny. He emerges from behind a bookcase and walks up to her}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Penny, there's something I need to ask you.

:{{d|Penny}}: Actually, there's something I wanted to say as well.

:{{d|Gumball}}: I know. I totally feel what you feel. Let's say it at the same time. One. Two-

:{{d|Penny}}: We need some space. 

::{{d|event|Gumball gasps and makes a shocked face}} 

:{{d|Penny}}: It's just… until you guys work it out, I kinda feel bad ruining your relationship. You two have something special, you know.

::{{d|event|Gumball, still shocked, screams as he runs off - without moving his legs. He screams and glides his way through the hallway, onto the bus, and back through his house until he arrives in his bedroom and finds Darwin waiting there. He is poorly dressed up like Penny}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ugh. What are you doing?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Whatever it takes for you to still love me. Is it working?

:{{d|Gumball}}: If by working, you mean making me nauseous then- {{d|event|Gags, then cries}} But it doesn't matter anyway. Penny's left me! She didn't want to come between us, and it's all your fault! {{d|event|Faceplants and sobs}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uh…I didn't mean to come between you two. I-I-I just wanted to spend more time with you. I'm so sorry. Come here-

::{{d|event|Darwin tries to reach out to Gumball, but Gumball avoids him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wait, this is creepy. {{d|event|Sobbing loudly}} But I really need a hug!

::{{d|event|Darwin holds Gumball, and comforts him}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: There, there.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Is it weird that I love her so much it makes my ears sweat?

:{{d|Darwin}}: No, no.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Is it weird that I think about her all the time, even in the bathroom?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Chuckles}} No.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Is it weird that I bought a ring and I want to ask her to marry me?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Well, yeah. That's-that's completely weird.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, it doesn't matter now. It's all ruined!

:{{d|Darwin}}: No, it's not. What if I could give you the perfect setting, the perfect moment?

:{{d|Gumball}}: What do you mean?

::{{d|event|Darwin begins dancing and imitating R&B music}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Stop it. That…that's weird.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Mm mm. Come on.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Snickers}} All right. {{d|event|Joins in dancing with him}} How are you gonna get a log cabin though? Or a lake? Or a chocolate fountain? And how are you gonna get her to come over?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Come on. Mm mm. {{d|event|He starts dancing towards the door}} Uh huh. Come on.

==The Perfect Date==
::{{d|event|At the Fitzgerald household, Darwin repeatedly rings the doorbell, then runs off}}

:{{d|Penny}}: I got it! Huh? 

::{{d|event|Penny opens the door and notices a trail of origami roses going down the staircases}}

:{{d|Penny}}: Origami roses? {{d|event|Picks up and examines one}} Made out of toilet paper. 

::{{d|event|She follows the trail, which leads her through the streets, to the Watterson house, and then into the backyard to their shed}} 

:{{d|Penny}}: Gumball? Guys? Hello? 

::{{d|event|Penny leans down in front of a puddle of antifreeze in front of the shed, sniffing it}} 

:{{d|Penny}}: Are your parents aware there's a lake of antifreeze in their backyard? This stuff's really flammable, you know. Huh? 

::{{d|event|Penny sees a jar with flies that have firecrackers tied to them and leans in. One fly is gesturing at the firecracker tied to it, inaudibly asking for help}}

::{{d|event|Penny knocks on the shed door and opens it. Gumball is in there, with a sensual face, and a fan with colored paper tied to it blowing loudly, emulating a fireplace. He says something to her, but the fan drowns him out}} 

:{{d|Penny}}: What?!

::{{d|event|Gumball turns off the fan}}

:{{d|gumball}} {{d|event|"Romantic" voice}} A-please. Sit down.

:{{d|penny}}: {{d|event|Snickers}} Wow. Okay... 

::{{d|event|Penny walks in the shed}}

:{{d|penny}}: Uh, why are you sitting on roadkill? {{d|event|She takes out a napkin and lays it on the floor, sitting on it}}

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Reading from a piece of paper}} "You have made me the happiest man in the world. Goodnight."

:{{d|penny}}: What?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Crumpling up the paper, whispering}} Dagnabbit, that's supposed to be the last one. {{d|event|Normally}} Uh, hold on.

::{{d|event|Gumball takes another piece of paper from his pocket and reads from it}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: "Romantic deep male voice. {{d|event|Speaks in the voice}} Welcome to the best night of your life." {{d|event|Squeaks}}

::{{d|event|Penny suppresses her laughter}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: May I offer you a refreshment?

::{{d|event|He opens a bottle of soda, but it fizzes out of control. Gumball tries to stop it, all while still making the face, with some struggle. Eventually, the fizzing stops, with Penny wiping her mouth. He pours the remaining drop of soda into a glass, drops the ring in it, and hands it to Penny}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Inhales}} To us. Ha ha ha ha uhhhhhh. Ha ha ha uhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Chocolate fountain! {{d|event|Claps his hands. Nothing happens}} CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN! {{d|event|Claps again}}

::{{d|event|From outside, Darwin squeals upon recieving the order. He starts chewing some chocolate, holding onto a hose, and quickly blows the chewed up chocolate through a hose. The chocolate comes out of a pipe inside the shed, spewing everywhere. Gumball takes some of the chewed up chocolate on a stick with a strawberry and offers it to Penny}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: So Penny, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.

::{{d|event|Penny throws the chocolate strawberry away}}

:{{d|penny}}: Uh, I'm listening.

::{{d|event|Gumball begins to read another piece of paper, one which holds the big question, but it is covered with chocolate}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh… uh—

:{{d|penny}}: {{d|event|Grabs and throws away the card}} Oh, look; stop with the cards, just talk to me.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} Okay. {{d|event|Inhales}} Will you mmmmm… will you mmmm… {{d|event|Punches himself in the face, frustrated}} Urgh! Will you mmm…

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Outside}} Come on man, just say it!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Nearly unintelligible}} Will you marry me… {{d|event|Mutters}} mmmmm…

:{{d|Darwin}}: Come on, COME ON!

::{{d|event|In impatience, he unintentionally breaks one of the jars containing the flies. The firecrackers on the flies ignite, and set fire to the origami roses as they fly around. Darwin tries blowing the fires out, but only adds fuel to them. He screams, steps on the ignited roses and peeks into the shed. After trying to get Gumball's attention, Gumball growls at him, so Darwin simply grabs a shovel and closes the door. As Gumball continues struggling to propose, Penny drinks her soda and chokes on the ring, changing forms as she coughs. Gumball now has his eyes closed, and so is unaware that she is choking. Darwin continues fighting the fires, now trying to smother them by beating them with the shovel. A stray ember sets the puddle of antifreeze alight. Darwin barges into the shed only to be greeted by Penny in her Gorgon form. He quickly closes the door, but upon seeing a propane tank about to explode, rushes in. He pushes Gumball's mouth with his fins in an attempt to help him speak}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Will you marry me?!

::{{d|event|He then grabs Penny, who is still choking, and all three jump out of the window just before the gas tank explodes, destroying the shed. Upon landing, the ring is dislodged from Penny's throat}}

:{{d|penny}}: {{d|event|Coughing}} What did you say back there?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Picks up the ring and beams, with flowers surrounding his face}} Marry me!

:{{d|penny}}: Oh Gumball, I can't.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Teary-eyed}} Why?

:{{d|penny}}: We're twelve years old.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Teary-eyed}} Age doesn't matter when it comes to love.

:{{d|penny}}: Legally, it kinda does. And I don't think Darwin's over it yet.

::{{d|event|Camera zooms out, revealing Darwin scowling. He then smiles, eye twitching}}

:{{d|Darwin}}:  No, I'm perfectly fine with it. {{d|event|Continues scowling}}

:{{d|penny}}: Besides, we don't need a ring to show we love each other.

:{{d|Gumball}}: What do we do with it, then?

:{{d|penny}}: I think I have an idea.

==Bromance==
:{{d|penny}}: …and Gumball. Do you, in the name of the bro-code, bromise to always love and take care of your bro in sickness and in health, brosperity and broverty?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I do. {{d|event|Puts ring on Darwin's fin}}

:{{d|penny}}: You may now high-five the bro.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|High five}} Yeah!

::{{d|event|Penny kisses Darwin and Gumball on their cheeks, and they all laugh as fireworks light up the sky. We see that the fire has spread, by way of the trail of origami roses, and eventually we find it has reached the Fitzgerald's house. The episode ends with the Fitzgeralds watching their house burn as firefighters try to put it out}}
