==Horrible Mother==
::{{d|event|Nicole is sleeping in her bed. Suddenly, an eerie shadow comes, and it turns out to be Anais. Nicole is shocked when she sees her}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Aah! 

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Holds up poster}} It's Daisy the Donkey on Ice Day! You promised to take me, and we're late!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Mommy worked really late last night.

::{{d|event|Anais holds a tape recorder and plays it}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|On recording}} What sort of a horrible mother wouldn't take her daughter to her favorite show?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, Anais, I know what I said, but--

::{{d|event|Anais replays the part that says "horrible mother" on repeat}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Okay.

==What Could Go Wrong?==
::{{d|event|The living room. Richard opens up a box}}

:{{d|Richard}}: "ElectroFat. Gets you fit while you watch TV." {{d|event|Puts the ElectroFat electrodes on his body}} So the last electrode goes... Where? Oh, there!

::{{d|event|Nicole and Anais go down the stairs, with Anais dragging Nicole while jumping and singing}}

:{{d|Anais}}: ''Daisy the Donkey, Daisy!''

:{{d|Richard}}: Oh, hi, Honey!

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Yawns}} Hi. Where's Gumball and Darwin?

:{{d|Richard}}: In the backyard, playing their made-up game.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Keep an eye on them. Every time they play that game, it's a mess.

::{{d|event|Flashback to when they played the game, the house was a mess}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Dodge or Dare!

::{{d|event|Flashback ends}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Relax, honey. I'm here. What could go wrong?

::{{d|event|Flashback to when Richard played with them, the house was on fire}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Richard}}: Dodge or Dare! Dodge or Dare! Dodge or Dare!

::{{d|event|Flashback ends}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Nervously}} Yeah... What could go wrong? 

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Frustrated}} ''Daisy the Donkey!''

::{{d|event|Nicole is pulled out of the house by Anais}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Now come on, ElectroFat. Make me beautiful! {{d|event|Turns on the switch and he screams}}

==Dodge or Dare==
::{{d|event|The backyard. Gumball and Darwin are playing Dodge or Dare. Richard's screaming is heard}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What was that?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Doesn't matter. It's time to play...

:{{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Gumball}}: Dodge or Dare! Roll the dice, take a card! {{d|event|Takes out a card}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dare! You have to throw the ball onto the moon using only objects from the trash!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Stretches his arms}} Ha! Just watch and learn. {{d|event|Quickly builds a Rube-Goldberg machine}} Yes! {{d|event|Blows out a marble}}

::{{d|event|The marble moves through the machine and eventually makes a bowling ball fly to Gumball's direction}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aaaahh! {{d|event|Covers his face with his hands as the ball is about to hit his face}}

::{{d|event|The ball's movement is suddenly paused}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hey, the card says "No hands".

::{{d|event|Gumball sighs and hardens his face to receive the ball. The ball suddenly moves again and bounces back from his face}}

::{{d|event|Cut to the Robinsons' backyard. The Robinsons are seated on lawn lounge chairs}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: I told you, Margaret. It's not a mid-life crisis. It's just a new car. 

::{{d|event|The ball suddenly hits Margaret's wig, causing it to fall off}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Huh, it landed on the Mr. Robinson's yard!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin scream in excitement and take a peek at the Robinson's backyard. Gaylord Robinson is seen laughing at his wife}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mr. Robinson, he's such a funny guy!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Mrs. Robinson is one lucky lady!

::{{d|event|Margaret puts her wig back on, glares at Gaylord and he stops laughing. They hear the doorbell ringing}}

::{{d|event|Cut to the front door. It opens and Gumball and Darwin are happily talking simultaneously}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Interrupting}} Your ball fell into my garden, causing my wife's hair... To fall off! Therefore, as a punishment, I'll teach you a new game called... Emm... 

::{{d|event|Margaret whispers something}} 

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Learning the consequences of your actions!

:{{d|Gumball}}: A game Mr. Robinson invented for us?

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Yay!

==The Punishment==
::{{d|event|Cut to the Robinsons' backyard}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: You can start by cleaning the garden.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Yes!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: But wait! {{d|event|Kicks the tree to make all of the leaves fall down}} There you go. You wouldn't want it to be easy, would ya? {{d|event|Laughs as he and Margaret go back into the house}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Woo-hoo! {{d|event|Jump in the pile of leaves}}

::{{d|event|A few hours later}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: We'll see if they're still smiling after this. {{d|event|Laughs with his wife}}

::{{d|event|The doorbell rings and the Robinsons immediately go to open it. They then stare dumbfounded at what they're seeing}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Excuse me. {{d|event|Takes a leaf from Gaylord's head}} There. {{d|event|Puts the leaf into a group of other leaves}} We're done! This is green, greeny-orange, orangey-green, terracotta, Egyptian sunrise, sunset yellow, and ''this''... {{d|event|Shows them a leaf that has Mr. Robinson's face}} ...is the Mr. Robinson head-shaped leaf.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Amazed}} Oooooooh! Can we keep it?

:{{d|Gaylord}}: No. {{d|event|Checks grass}} You slackers forgot to cut the grass!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, Mr. Robinson, you're so right.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Punches his own head}} What were we thinking?!

:{{d|Gumball}}: We'll get it right on it. {{d|event|Cheers with hands up}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: But, wait! {{d|event|Hands out his nail clippers}} You got to use nail clippers.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Yay! Thank you, Mr. Robinson! {{d|event|Both run in excitement back in the backyard}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: I think they're missing the point. 

::{{d|event|Gaylord and Margaret face to the door to go back inside}} 

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Done!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: What the...?!

::{{d|event|The backyard is shown to be very tidy and sparkly}} 

:{{d|The Sun}}: Oh!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: All right, goons. {{d|event|Carries a paint can and a brush}} Come here and, paint this fence blue.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Yay! {{d|event|Run in excitement to back in the backyard}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: That'll teach them to mess with Gaylord Robinson.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Done!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Hmph! Now Make it green!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Done!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Orange with purple stripes!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Done!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Yellow with black dots!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Done!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Pink!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Done!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Red!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Done!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Blue!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Done!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Black!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Done!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Yellow!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Done!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Aaaaarrgh!!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Mr. Robinson, since you love painting so much, I made this bird especially for you. {{d|event|Shows his drawing and gives it to Mr. Robinson}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Receives Darwin's painting, confused}} Uh, thanks? 

::{{d|event|Margaret whispers to him}} 

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Oh, yeah! {{d|event|Throws away Darwin's painting}} Follow me!

==More Punishment==
::{{d|event|Cut to the Robinsons' living room}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Now, there is a stain on this rug.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Where?

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Throws juice in a glass onto the rug}} There!

::{{d|event|Gaylord and Margaret laugh as if they have done something evil, but stops after looking at the rug, confused}} 

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Huh?!

::{{d|event|The rug is still clean as the juice stain never landed onto it}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: I mean, there! {{d|event|Throws more juice onto the rug}}

::{{d|event|The rug stays clean}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: What?! {{d|event|Holds a glass of juice, confused}} Huh?!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: More ice, sir? {{d|event|Carries a bucket of ice cubes}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Argh! Gimme that! {{d|event|Grabs the jug from Margaret and angrily throws its juice onto the rug}} Aaargh! Ugh!

::{{d|event|In a slow-motion scene, Gumball quickly drinks the juice, keeping the rug clean. Darwin then cleans his mouth with a napkin}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Huh?! {{d|event|Looks at the jug in confusion}} What?! {{d|event|Looks at the glass in confusion}} Okay, now you're scaring me.

==Unnecessary Help==
::{{d|event|Cut to in front of the Robinsons' house. Gaylord sends Gumball and Darwin out of the house and slams the door}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm sure Mr. Robinson needs more help.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Maybe he's too shy to ask.

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Camera zooms to the mail chute}} Go away!

:{{d|Gumball}}: He hides it well, but, I can feel he needs us.

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|From left lower window}} Go away! {{d|event|From right upper window}} Go away! {{d|event|From left upper window}} Go away!!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Now, ''that'' is a cry for help. {{d|event|Points above him}}

::{{d|event|Back to the Robinsons' living room}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Reads newspaper}} Those little parasites, they just won't-- {{d|event|Someone clips his nails}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Stops clipping Gaylord's toenails}} Oh! Hi, Mr. Robinson.

:{{d|Gaylord}}: What?! {{d|event|Angrily}} Don't touch me!

::{{d|event|Cut to outside, then quickly cut back to the Robinsons' living room}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Annoyed}} Unbelievable. Huh?!

::{{d|event|Gumball starts poking Gaylord's face with a fork with a lump of food on it as he tries to feed him, then camera zooms out to reveal Gumball and Darwin with a plate of food}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on, eat up, Mr. Robinson.

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Angrily}} Get away from me!

::{{d|event|Cut to outside, then quickly cut to the Robinsons' bathroom}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Annoyed}} Darn those kids. Can a guy get some privacy in his own house? {{d|event|Tries to get some toilet paper, but realizes it has ran out}} Blasted, out of paper.

::{{d|event|Suddenly, Gumball's hand appears, holding a pink toilet paper roll as he wants to give it to Gaylord}} {{d|event|Angrily}} 

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Get out of here! {{d|event|Throws the toilet paper. The toilet paper hits Darwin's head}}

::{{d|event|Brief pause}} 

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Oh, wait. Could you throw that back please?

::{{d|event|Cut to the Robinsons' bedroom, with Gaylord lying down in his bed}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Groans}} I need to lay down.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin suddenly rise near the bed}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: It's bed time, Mr. Robinson! {{d|event|Puts on a baby bonnet on Gaylord}}

::{{d|event|Gaylord fumes his anger, heating his head}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh... {{d|event|Puts his hands to Mr. Robinson skin to indicate if he has a fever}} I think he has a temperature.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on, Mr. Robinson. {{d|event|Hands a thermometer to Gaylord}} Say "Aah!".

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!

::{{d|event|The house literally shakes}}

==Car Wash==
::{{d|event|Cut to the Robinsons' living room}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Groans}} Listen, kids, why are you trying so hard to help me?

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|With sparkling eyes}} Because we love you, Mr. Robinson.

:{{d|Gaylord}}: But, there's nothing left for you to do!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: We could clean your new car.

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Uh, no way! My car is brand new and very expensive!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: We could clean Mrs. Robinson.

::{{d|event|Margaret appears behind Gaylord, indicating she doesn't want to be cleaned by them}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: All right, clean the car.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Yaaay! {{d|event|Run in excitement to the door to start their task}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Bu-bu-bu-bu-but, please be careful with it!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are outside the Robinsons' house, starting to clean the car}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: So, where do we start?

:{{d|Darwin}}: I don't know. I never cleaned a car before.

:{{d|Gumball}}: It doesn't matter. {{d|event|Squeezes Darwin's cheeks}} Let's make Mr. Robinson proud.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Okay. 

::{{d|event|Gumball starts to gently touch the car with a sponge}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Easy. Mr. Robinson said it's very expensive.

:{{d|Gumball}}: I know. I'll just... 

::{{d|event|The sponge touches the car by a centimeter. The car collapses}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: At least things can't get any worse. 

::{{d|event|The car's wreckage bursts into flames, Gumball and Darwin scream}}

::{{d|event|Cut to the backyard with Gaylord and Margaret sitting, and the smoke coming from the car is seen behind}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: You know, Margaret, maybe those kids aren't so bad after all.

::{{d|event|Cut back to the trouble scene}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Panicked}} What are we gonna do?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: I don't know. I never burned a car before.

:{{d|Gumball}}: This is terrible!

:{{d|Darwin}}: We failed him!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ohh, the shame!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Can't ever show our faces again! {{d|event|Squeezes his cheeks in panic}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: We need to hide away forever!

::{{d|event|Darwin cries}}

==Hide!==
::{{d|event|Cut to the Wattersons' attic}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ooh, dark.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Cleans half of the dust}} Filthy.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Horrible.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Perfect.

::{{d|event|Gaylord and Margaret walk to the front yard and see their car is destroyed}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Shocked}} My car! {{d|event|Gets down on his knees in despair}} Who... did... this?!

::{{d|event|Margaret whispers}} 

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Those kids! I'm gonna get them for this!

::{{d|event|Cut to inside the attic with Gumball and Darwin}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|From outside}} Come out! I'm calling the Sherriff!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} Oh, no. They know we wrecked the car.

::{{d|event|A silhouette appears behind them, and it turns out to be Richard}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} What do you mean you wrecked the car?

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin scream as they see Richard behind them. Their scream causes the screen to shake}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dad?

:{{d|Richard}}: Hi.

==Someone's Back==
::{{d|event|Cut to the Watterson's car, with Anais and Nicole, coming home from Daisy the Donkey on Ice. Anais is holding a giant Daisy plushie}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Singing}} ''Daisy! Daisy the Donkey!'' Mom, why the Robinsons talking to the Sheriff on the lawn?

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Nervously}} I don't know, sweetie. 

::{{d|event|Nicole pushes Anais downwards as she ducks out of sight}} 

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} I think we'll just go around the back.

::{{d|event|Cut to the front of the Robinsons' house, with Gaylord, Margaret, and Doughnut Sheriff}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: I'm telling you, Sheriff! It was those kids next door as sure as I...

::{{d|event|Gaylord is interrupted by a car passing by, with a view of a Daisy doll in the driver seat}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: What?

::{{d|event|Cut back to the attic}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sadly}} We just touched it with a sponge and it fell apart! So we decided to hide here forever.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Sniffs}} Such a sad story! {{d|event|His eyes sparkles as he feels sad, then quickly turns back to normal and starts telling them what really happened}} But it's not true! You see, it was 9 o'clock this morning, and... {{d|event|Imitates a sound effect as he starts a flashback}}

::{{d|event|Flashback to earlier morning}}

:{{d|Richard}}: ...come on ElectroFat. Make me beautiful! 

::{{d|event|Richard turns on the switch and screams in pain, spazzing out while moving his arms like a robot. He then manages to take off the ElectroFat electrodes}}

:{{d|Richard}}: You... thing of... beauty!

::{{d|event|The ElectroFat gets thrown out of the window and hits the Robinsons' car. Richard then walks out of the house and approaches the car}} 

:{{d|Richard}}: Oh, Mr. Robinson's new car. 

::{{d|event|Camera zooms in to show a dink in the car}} 

:{{d|Richard}}: Oh, okay. It's just a dink. I'll bang it out. {{d|event|Pulls out a hammer and bangs the car, only to cause another large dink}} This may take a while. 

::{{d|event|Sometime later}} 

:{{d|Richard}}: There... 

::{{d|event|Camera zooms out to the car}} 

:{{d|Richard}}: Finished! 

::{{d|event|The car breaks down immediately}} 

:{{d|Richard}}: Aaahh!

::{{d|event|Richard tries to fix the car in a quick movement, then exhales as he finishes, and runs away in horror. Flashback ends}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Makes the sound effect noises again}} So you see, it was my fault, not yours.

:{{d|Gumball}}: What should we do now?

:{{d|Richard}}: Well, I think the most responsible thing to do is to hide here forever. {{d|event|Whispering}} And never let your mother find out what happened.

::{{d|event|Anais and Nicole suddenly appear behind them}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} I already know.

::{{d|event|The three scream as they see Anais and Nicole.Their scream causes the screen to shake like before}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Honey?

:{{d|Nicole}}: But it's not quite what you think. It was 9 o'clock this morning—

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Interrupts Nicole}} Wait! Can I do this? {{d|event|Imitates a sound effect again to start another flashback}}

::{{d|event|Flashback to earlier morning}}

:{{d|Anais}}: ''Daisy!'' Put the tape on, Mom!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Yes, honey. {{d|event|Ducks to find the tape}} Where is it? {{d|event|Finds the tape}} Here!

:{{d|Anais}}: Yeah! {{d|event|Cheers}}

::{{d|event|Suddenly, the car hits the Robinsons' car, destroying its headlights and shocking them}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Voice-over}} They parked right in front of our lawn. I just didn't see it. I was about to tell Mr. Robinson, but— 

::{{d|event|Cut to Anais playing the recorder and replaying the part that says "horrible mother". Nicole sighs, and decides to go anyway}} 

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Voice-over}} So, we went to see the show.

::{{d|event|They leave in the car. Flashback ends}}

:{{d|Anais}}: And it was great!

:{{d|Nicole}}: So there. It was mostly my fault. {{d|event|Looks down}}

:{{d|Richard}}: I'm so relieved. It was a family effort.

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|From outside}} Darn it! I know there up there! {{d|event|Cut to outside}} Get in there and arrest those vandals!

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Ah, not without a warrant, sir.

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|Angrily screams}} I PAY MY TAXES, AND THAT PAYS YOUR SALARY! ERGO... {{d|event|Pokes Sheriff in annoyance}} I'M... YOUR... BOSS! NOW, GET IN THERE AND DO YOUR JOB!

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Please, sir, calm down!

:{{d|Gaylord}}: All right. {{d|event|Faces to Margaret}} I suppose I shall have to take matters into my own hands, huh?! Well... 

::{{d|event|Background changes to flames, with Margaret holding a duster and Gaylord holding a golf club}} 

:{{d|Gaylord}}: Here come the Robinsons.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Looks from the attic window}} Poor Mr. Robinson. We wrecked his beautiful new car {{d|event|Cut to inside the attic}} and nobody has the courtesy to apologize.

:{{d|Darwin}}: We should be ashamed of ourselves!

:{{d|Gumball}}: So, let's get out there and apologize...

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin's eyes sparkle}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: as a family.

:{{d|Anais}}, {{d|Nicole}} and {{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Sigh}} Okay.

==Bad Neighbors==
::{{d|event|The family step outside, and they are shocked}}

:{{d|Nicole}} and {{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Gasp}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: This is what happens when you mess with Gaylord! {{d|event|He and Margaret start destroying Richard's car}} This is what happens! THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS! THIS... IS... WHAT... HAPPENS!

:{{d|Richard}}: They look kind of angry, Gumball.

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Please, stop! Please! 

::{{d|event|Margaret turns around, hissing, as she is about to assault the Doughnut Sheriff with the duster, making him more nervous}} 

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Please, ma'am, drop the duster! Please! No, ma'am! {{d|event|Pulls out his taser}} No, no! {{d|event|Zaps Margaret}}

::{{d|event|Margaret falls down, The Doughnut Sheriff realizes his mistake, and Gaylord slowly turns his head to see Margaret, assuming she is dead}}

:{{d|Gaylord}}: {{d|event|In slow-motion}} ''MARGARET!!''

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: No, sir! No, please! 

::{{d|event|Gaylord angrily jumps over the Doughnut Sheriff, ready to attack him with the golf club, then camera cuts to the electrified Gaylord and Margaret}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Maybe we should give them time to calm down.

::{{d|event|Cut to Gaylord and Margaret sitting in the police car, angrily yelling at the Wattersons}}

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: So, uh, do you wanna press charges?

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the Wattersons. Nicole is now smiling nervously}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Laughs nervously}} No. I'm sure they learned their lesson.

::{{d|event|Cut back to the police car}}

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: It's too bad you have to live next to such monsters. {{d|event|Gets into the police car}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry, Mr. Robinson. We'll look out for your house while you're gone.

::{{d|event|Gaylord and Margaret angrily yell at Gumball and Darwin as the police car leaves}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Such a great guy.

:{{d|Richard}}: Well, there is one important thing we learned today.

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, {{d|Anais}}, and {{d|Nicole}}: Huh?

:{{d|Richard}}: That ElectroFat Machine was worth {{d|event|Takes off his shirt, revealing his abs}} ''every'' penny. 

::{{d|event|Richard flexes his abs and the episode ends}}
