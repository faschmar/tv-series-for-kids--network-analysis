==Pillow Fight==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are pillow fighting}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Film slows down}} First, distract target. {{d|event|Film returns to normal}} Look, behind you, your butt! {{d|event|Film slows down}} Then disorientate. {{d|event|Gumball hits Darwin with a pillow}} {{d|event|Gumball evades Darwin's pillow attack}} Adopt a 90 degree evasion. Uppercut, and disarm him. {{d|event|Darwin became disoriented while Gumball takes his pillow}} Discombobulate. Wait, I have no idea what that means. Just double knock him on the head real hard. {{d|event|Gumball hits Darwin in the head with two pillows}} Employ rabbit block, and strike. {{d|event|Gumball blocks Darwin's attack with two fingers and strikes}} Enemy disarmed, confused—ready for the coup de grace. {{d|event|Gumball attacks as Darwin falls down}} Deliver final quip: Time to hit the sack, literally. {{d|event|Film rewinds to the beginning of the fight}} A formidable plan. Commence attack.
:{{d|Anais}}: Hi-ya! {{d|event|Anais suddenly attacks Gumball from the rear}}
::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin, and Anais laugh. Nicole enters the room}}
:{{d|Nicole}}: What are you doing?! You're gonna miss the school bus.
::{{d|event|The school bus' horn sound off-screen as it arrives}}
:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Film slows down}} Okay, plan of attack. Kick children through the window, grab the two boys, twirl three times to generate speed, release it at exact 78 degree angle, throw the boys through the window directly into the school bus. Preserve reputation for punctuality, deliver clever mom quip. {{d|event|Film returns to normal. Nicole prepares to grab Gumball and Darwin to launch them to the bus, but finds them gone}} What? where are they?
::{{d|event|Nicole looks out the window, showing Gumball and Darwin instantly outside, quickly getting on the school bus, which then leaves}}
:{{d|Anais}}: I think you lost them at "Throw them through the window." {{d|event|Nicole becomes disappointed at this}} Alright, what was your quip?
: {{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Inhales}} You just got bus-ted.
: {{d|Anais}}: Meh, would've been better if you'd said: "You just got schooled."
: {{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Inhales}} You just got—
: {{d|Anais}}: It's too late now. {{d|event|Nicole becomes disappointed again}}

==School==
:: {{d|event|Bell rings}}
:: {{d|event|Darwin sneezes two times}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: Dude, what is that? You've been doing it all morning.
: {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Sneezes}} Sneezing. Can't you tell?
: {{d|Gumball}}: Not really. You sound like the world's angriest baby. What's wrong with you?
: {{d|Darwin}}: My throat is itchy, {{d|event|sneezes}} my breath is wheezy {{d|event|sneezes as Gumball shields himself}}, my eyes are watery {{d|event|sneezes}}.
: {{d|Gumball}}: Hmm. Sounds like worms. I think you've got worms. Just squat over a bowl of milk, and whistle till they come out.
: {{d|Darwin}}: No dude, I think I'm allergic to something.
: {{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry my friend! Whatever it is, we will find. And we will not rest until we find you a cure! And you will be rid of this terrible affliction! I promise.

==Outside==
:: {{d|event|Outside, Gumball and Darwin are sitting on a bench while Gumball is playing a digital game}}
: {{d|Darwin}}: So, When?
: {{d|Gumball}}: Huh? When what?
:: {{d|event|Darwin sneezes off Gumball' s gamepad}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh. That. Well, now I guess.

==The Nurse's Office==
:{{d|Teri}}: So the symptoms are a weird, empty sensation in my stomach; the feeling of light-headedness; and unusual amount of saliva in my mouth when I think of food. I checked on the internet, and apparently it might be something called the G-Virus, which can only be cured by cutting off the infected part or the removal of the brain.
:{{d|School Nurse}}: Hmm. I'm gonna prescribe two weeks off, and a couple of heavy sedatives a day for six weeks.
:{{d|Teri}}: Ah, thank you.
:{{d|School Nurse}}: No, that's for me. What you just described is called being hungry. Now for the last time, please get out of my office so I can curl up under my desk and revise my career choices.
:{{d|Teri}}: But I told you, I need—
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin walk in}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh, hi. Darwin can't stop sneezing...
:{{d|Teri}}: I was here first {{d|event|Starts talking hysterically}}
:{{d|School Nurse}}: Just a sec. {{d|event|Draws stitches on Teri's mouth}} How can I help you?
::{{d|event|Darwin sneezes and causes a nearby chart to move}}
:{{d|School Nurse}}: Right. Sounds like a simple allergy. Just hold it in, and get back to class.
:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh okay. {{d|event|Darwin holds his sneeze and causes his head to inflate and eventually inflates his feet and causes his shoes to pop}}
:{{d|Teri}}: {{d|event|Mumbles and erases the stitch on her mouth}} You should never hold a sneeze, it's very dangerous! You could pop a blood vessel, or even worse.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Is she right?
:{{d|School Nurse}}: What she is is a pain in the neck who makes my job a nightmare.
:{{d|Teri}}: If you have a pain in the neck you should really consult a medical professional {{d|event|Darwin starts to sneeze, the school nurse turns him towards Teri}} because your vertebrae may have slipped out of alignment, which could be a sign of something more serious... {{d|event|Darwin's sneeze causes Teri to fly through the window}}
:{{d|School Nurse}}: Have a nice day.
: {{d|Gumball}}: Aren't you suppose to take care of kids who are ill?
: {{d|School Nurse}}: {{d|event|Forces a smile}} Have a nice day!
: {{d|Gumball}}: But we still don't know what he's allergic too.
: {{d|School Nurse}}: HAVE A NICE DAY!
: {{d|Gumball}}: I feel like you're trying to tell us something.
: {{d|School Nurse}}: HAVE A NICE—
:: {{d|event|Darwin sneezes, launching the School Nurse into a cabinet. The cabinet falls down, and squishes her}}
: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} I'll never know what she was gonna say now.
: {{d|Darwin}}: What are we gonna to do?
: {{d|Gumball}}: Hmm. We're gonna need to find an alternative to traditional medicine.
: {{d|event|They hear the sound of rapid footsteps. Mr. Small rushes into the office, demolishing the door}}
: {{d|Mr. Small}}: {{d|event|Pants for awhile, catches his breath}} Did I hear someone talk about alternative medicine?

==Counselor's Office==
: {{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​: Alternative medicines are often ridiculed for being a bunch of magic baloney practiced by gang of almost criminal bozos. But look at me, {{d|event|Zooms our showing Mr. Small in a weird outfit}} you can tell right away, it is no laughing matter.
: {{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, it's definitely a bit sad.
: {{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​: So the plan is to clean your energy by absorbing the toxins with the power of this unbreakable crystal.
:: {{d|event|Mr. Small accidentally drops the crystal and it breaks into two; he picks up each piece}}
: {{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: The power of these two unbreakable crystals.
: {{d|Gumball}}: How does that work?
: {{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: I don't know, the magazine this came with went bankrupt after two editions. I'll just, uh, do this.
:: {{d|event|Mr. Small puts the crystals onto Darwin's nostrils}}
: {{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​: How does that feel?
: {{d|Darwin}}: Good! I think—
:: {{d|event|Darwin sneezes, launching the crystals. They fly out of the window, and hit Rocky, who is cutting leaves off the tree top, and he falls down}}
: {{d|Rocky}}: I'm not okay!
: {{d|Small}}​​​​​​​: Don't worry! I've got a diploma in the ancient art of acupuncture.
: {{d|Gumball}}: Really?
: {{d|Small}}​​​​​​​: Yeah. I bought it in the internet. It came with a scuba diving license, and a dog breeding permit.

==Counselor's Office 2==
:: {{d|event|Mr. Small puts acupuncture pins all over Darwin's body}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: Ah! Ee! Oh! Ah, not there! OH!
:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, on a pain scale of one to ten this looks like it would score at least uh, "somebody please finish me off every second of my tragic existence is pure agony."
:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​: Don't worry! Acupuncture's completely painless.
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|With his mouth foaming}} You're right, I can't feel pain, or anything from the neck down.
:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​: Yeah, I couldn't remember the exact energy points I needed to strike. So, better safe than sorry. But hey! At least it worked! You haven't sneezed for a whole—
::{{d|event|Darwin sneezes, and the acupuncture pins hit Gumball and Mr. Small. Gumball deflates}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Ugh. I can smell dancing, and taste purple. Are there gonna be more side-effects?
:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Speaking in French}} The pineapple is so mysterious while dancing in bikinis... {{d|event|Removes a needle from himself}} I'm sorry. What I meant to say was {{d|event|slouches over and groans; falls unconsious}}
::{{d|event|Darwin then sneezes and flies out the door}}

==The Courtyard==
::{{d|event|Darwin's sneezes could be heard. His sneezes are getting more destructive. One of his sneezes push Gumball near a wall. Some playing cards fly with him, and impale the concrete wall}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: I think the best thing to do is just ignore it. I mean how bad can it get?
::{{d|event|Gumball tries to pull out a card that is stuck on the wall}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Do you have any nines?
:{{d|Darwin}}: No. {{d|event|Darwin sneezes and Gumball is flung back to the wall}} Go-fish.
:{{d|Gumball}}: It's the other people that I'm worried about. I think your allergy is starting to seriously get on their nerves.
::{{d|event|Darwin sneezes again, making the cards fly away like knives}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: What do you mean?
::{{d|event|Shows the Eggheads. The cards are stuck on their backs.  Darwin sneezes again, making Tobias' colors fly off and replace Banana Joe's own colors. He sneezes again, and makes Sarah's head bump into Teri's face}}
:{{d|Teri}}: AH! I'm lactose intolerant! Probably...
::{{d|event|Darwin sneezes again. Principal Brown (who was watching the effects of Darwin's sneezes through a window) is knocked down by Idaho}}

==The Watterson Car==
::{{d|event|Richard picks up Gumball and Darwin, and Darwin sneezes and makes Richard accidentally reverse the car, hitting Marvin}}
:{{d|Marvin}}: That hurt.
:{{d|Gumball}}: I can't believe you were suspended for being too dangerous!
:{{d|Richard}}: And I can't believe ''you'' just ditched school without a proper excuse!
:{{d|Gumball}}: Well ''we'' are all in this together! If Darwin gets to skip class, so do I!
:{{d|Darwin}}: I thought this was about finding what I'm allergic to.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Yes, that as well.
:{{d|Anais}}: Well, he's been hanging around with you all day. So maybe he's allergic to stupidity.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey! It's not nice being mean about people's stupidity, but I'm gonna calm down now because now that I think about it that's actually quite a good theory!
:{{d|Anais}}: Uh, is it?
:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, yeah. It all started with that stupid pillow fight.
:{{d|Darwin}}: And the more people gave me stupid solutions, the worse it got!
:{{d|Anais}}: Hmm. There must be a way to prove this, but how?
:{{d|Richard}}: Hey guys! Do you sometimes wonder what tree does cheese come from?
::{{d|event|Darwin sneezes, flipping the car over}}
:{{d|Anais}}: Now we're sure.

==The Watterson House==
:{{d|Nicole}}: Okay, we want to come up with a plan {{d|event|Richard has a cloth tied around his mouth}} But please, no more stupid ideas {{d|event|A hole is shown through the Wattersons' wall}} I don't think this house can take it. {{d|event|Their neighbor's house has a hole through it, with Gary staring at it}} or any other house for that matter.
::{{d|event|Gumball is about to suggest something, but is interrupted by Nicole}}
:{{d|Nicole}}: Gumball, please ''think'' before you speak.
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Thinking}} What if—
::{{d|event|Darwin sneezes a huge blast across the neighborhood, demolishing the next seven houses down the line}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Coughing along with the rest of the Wattersons}} What the what? Dude, I didn't even finish my sentence!
:{{d|Darwin}}: Sorry, I anticipated.
:{{d|Anais}}: It was bound to be stupid.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey! We're in a democracy here. Can I get a chance to speak please?
::{{d|event|Anais sighs}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: What if he sneezed upwards? Nothing would get damaged!
:{{d|event|Darwin sneezes upward, causing a hole in the roof}}
:{{d|Anais}}: I knew it.
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Now also has a cloth tied over his mouth}} Mmm.
:{{d|Nicole}}: Come on, you're the one with all the good genes. What should we do?
:{{d|Anais}}: Let's move to the desert, there's nothing to destroy there.

==To the Desert==
::{{d|event|Everyone is getting into the car}}
:{{d|Nicole}}: Alright, we're not going to talk. We're just going to listen to the radio.
::{{d|event|She turns on the radio}}
:{{d|Radio}}: Worried about your weight? Try "H-2-Low," our new diet water. Twice the taste, half the waste... size—
:{{d|Anais}}: Diet water? That sounds completely stup—
:{{d|event|Darwin sneezes, blowing Richard and Nicole out of the car along, with the front seat. Richard and Nicole's heads then drop down and they become unconscious}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: I guess we'll be walking.
::{{d|event|Darwin sneezes, causing the car to reverse into the car behind it. The car explodes}}
:{{d|Anais}}: Or running!
::{{d|event|Scene skips to Gumball and Anais, pushing Darwin along the sidewalk}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on, man!
::{{d|event|Darwin sneezes, pushing them back}}
::{{d|event|Gumball and Anais try several ways to push Darwin, while he keeps sending them back with his sneezes}}
:{{d|Anais}}: Let's try the other way around.
::{{d|event|Darwin sneezes, causing them all to go forward}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey, that was a pretty good trick, man! Try sneezing down. That should propel us straight outta town!
::{{d|Event|Darwin sneezes down, causing him, Anais, and Gumball to float in the sky along with other objects. After a while, they fall down. Gumball faceplants}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Muffled}} Even I admit that was a stupid idea.
:{{d|Anais}}: And it's gonna get worse! RUN!
::{{d|Event|They run through the streets as cars and other objects fall down from the sky. A remarkably long trailer truck falls down, and its long body starts crashing on them}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Quick! Let's run away as fast as we can in a straight line!
::{{d|Event|As they run away from the crashing body of the truck, they scream. Finally, the whole body crashes down, and they stop running}}
:{{d|Anais}}: I don't know what was more stupid: the fact that that was your solution, or that we just followed you.
::{{d|Event|Darwin begins to sneeze. He tries to hold it in, but it's too strong}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: I think it was more stupid that you pointed it out.
::{{d|Event|Darwin turns to a baby in a carriage, and is about to sneeze}}
:{{d|Anais}}: No, don't do it there!
::{{d|Event|Gumball takes Darwin and makes him face the truck. The rear doors of the truck open, revealing a baby panda. Gumball turns Darwin away, again pointing him at the direction of the baby. He tries to decide}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: We need to choose!
:{{d|Darwin}}: Go for the panda! They've given up on life anyway!
:{{d|Anais}}: Wait, over here!
::{{d|Event|They plug Darwin into a hole in a nearby fence. He makes a strong sneeze. After he sneezes, Gumball and Anais sigh in relief}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: That was close. Good job team!
::{{d|Event|They run off. It is revealed that through the other side of the fence, Darwin's sneeze had destroyed a kitten orphanage}}
:{{d|Anais}}: Come on Darwin, we're almost out of town!
:{{d|Gumball}}: Just as long as we don't bump into some stupid obstacle again.
::{{d|Event|They bump into Banana Joe with his parents}}
:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Oh, hey guys! Did you know that—
:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't! Trust me, it's for your own safety.
:{{d|Banana Joe}}: But—
:{{d|Gumball}}: No no no no no no no! Don't speak! Don't say a thing, he's really dangerous. One stupid word, and you could all get blown off to the other side of the specific ocean.
:{{d|Anais}}: Did you just say…"specific" ocean?
::{{d|Event|Gumball and Anais get down, and take cover. Darwin sneezes at the Bananas. The next scene shows the bananas landing in China}}

==The Desert==
::{{d|Event|Gumball, Darwin, and Anais finally arrive in the desert}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Yay! We made it.
:{{d|Darwin}}: Stop. I'm gonna continue alone.
:{{d|Gumball}}: What? Why?
:{{d|Darwin}}: 'Cause I love you. But…but—
:{{d|Anais}}: But you're a slack-jawed pea-brained dimwit, and you'll always be in danger of getting your head blown off every time you open your mouth around him.
:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm not going anywhere man. Ow!
::{{d|Event|Darwin throws rocks at him}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: Go. Just go! I don't wanna hurt you.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Well stop throwing stones at me then!
:{{d|Darwin}}: But what are you gonna do if I sneeze again? {{d|event|Sobs}}
::{{d|Event|Gumball takes off his belt, and ties it around a tree and his arm}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Then I will be ready! {{d|event|Pants fall down}}
::{{d|Event|Darwin is about to sneeze}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: RUN!
:{{d|Gumball}}: We can take it. We're your family-uh.
::{{d|Event|He looks back to see Anais gone from his side. She goes behind Darwin}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: What are you doing?
:{{d|Anais}}: Well, I'm avoiding the blast.
::{{d|Event|Darwin lets out a loud, strong sneeze for a prolonged period of time. Gumball holds on to his belt tied around the tree. As Darwin is still sneezing, Anais notices a feather stuck in his gills. She plucks it out}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Cheerily}} Oh! I feel great!
::{{d|Event|Gumball falls down. He is soggy from the blast}}
:{{d|Anais}}: Meh. My bad. Looks like you weren't allergic to stupidity. Just feathers.
:{{d|Gumball}}: It must have gotten in there during the pillow fight.
:{{d|Darwin}}: Everything is okay then. We can all go home.
::{{d|Event|A crow lands on Darwin's head. This makes him sneeze again, breaking the camera (and also the fourth wall). The episode ends}}
