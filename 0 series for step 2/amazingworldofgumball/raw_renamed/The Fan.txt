==Running to the Rainbow Factory==
::{{d|event|The episode opens with an exterior of a gate to the Wattersons' house. Gumball comes crashing through it}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hurry up, we're running out of time!

::{{d|event|Darwin runs, catching up with Gumball}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: That gate was unlocked!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I don't care, we only have two minutes to get there! {{d|event|Jumps on a series of cars and garbage cans}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: You do know there's a sidewalk, right?

:{{d|Gumball}}: No time to explain! We need to keep moving! {{d|event|Spills a trash can, ruins a mailbox, ruins a garden plastic flamingo, and jumps through a decorative shrub design, ruining it}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Was that really necessary?

:{{d|Gumball}}: No time to worry about collateral damage!

:{{d|Darwin}}: I'm pretty sure that was just ''damage'' damage.

::{{d|event|Sarah appears on the sidewalk}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Hey guys! I just want to—

:{{d|Darwin}}: Sorry, we don't have time right now!

::{{d|event|Sarah appears again}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Hey, guys!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Sorry, no time.

::{{d|event|Sarah appears once again}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Hey guys. {{d|event|Appears again}} Hey guys!

:{{d|Gumball}}: What the?

:{{d|Sarah}}: {{d|event|Appears}} Hey guys!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Alright, go for it. {{d|event|Gumball rams into Sarah, knocking her head off her cone}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: {{d|event|Appears again in front of a fence, unharmed}} Oh, hi guys!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin use her head as leverage to jump over the fence}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Sorry!

::{{d|event|Sarah appears in a yard with a cube dog running towards Gumball and Darwin}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Hi guys!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Grabs the cube dog, releases it at Sarah}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Just go home, okay?

:{{d|Sarah}}: I just wanna— {{d|event|Gets attacked by the cube dog, but appears on the sidewalk again, unharmed}} Hey guys! {{d|event|Gets knocked over, then appears again in front of a store}} Hey guys! {{d|event|Gets her face smashed into window, and appears again, next to a car}} Hey guys! {{d|event|Gets jammed into car and appears again, knocked over by Gumball and Darwin}} Hey guys! {{d|event|Appears again unharmed on the sidewalk}} Hey guys, I just want to— {{d|event|Gumball runs back to push Sarah}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: WE ''DON'T'' HAVE THE TIME!

:{{d|Sarah}}: Hey guys! {{d|event|Gumball tosses her away, and she appears on the sidewalk again}} Hi guys! {{d|event|The first Sarah crashes into another Sarah}}

:{{d|Both Sarahs}}: Hey guys!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin reach the end of the block, where Sarah is present}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Oh, hi guys.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Frustrated}} Uh, what?!

:{{d|Sarah}}: I just wanted to say… it's ICE to see yoou! {{d|event|An unseen crowd is heard laughing}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Look, Sarah, we don't have time for this.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, we have to — why are we running again?

::{{d|event|The Rainbow Factory explodes in the distance}}

==A Sitcom Ending==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are sitting on the school hallway floor, crying}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: The whole Rainbow Factory, destroyed! And we could have saved it!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah, but we could have not caused it too.

:{{d|Gumball}}: The water supply contaminated for centuries! They say our kids will look even weirder than we do!

:{{d|Sarah}}: Hey guys!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin sigh}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Well, I guess the moral of this story is, "All's well that ends well!" {{d|event|laughs}}

::{{d|event|The frame freezes as the words "The End" appear on screen, and a jingle plays}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: SARAH! This did not end well, for anyone! It'll take three weeks to rebuild it!

:{{d|Sarah}}: Yeah. Well, then I guess you could say, "The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence!" {{d|event|Winks and laughs again}}

::{{d|event|Frame freezes again, and the words "Executive Producer" and "Sarah G. Lato" appear on screen as the jingle continues}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sarah, all the grass is on fire and so is the goshdarn fence!

::{{d|event|An unseen audience is heard laughing}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: OK, what is that? Who's laughing!?

::{{d|event|Sarah reveals an audio recorder, and stops the audience laughter noise. Then Gumball pulls it from Sarah, and throws it away. Sarah fetches it, then she plays cartoon music in it}}

==Sarah's Role==
::{{d|event|Cut to the cafeteria, and Sarah stops cartoon music playing on her recorder. While Gumball and Darwin eat, they suddenly hear a weird noise. To the left Sarah is seen noisily eating an ice cream from the tail cone. She sucks all the ice cream into her mouth}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Ah! {{d|event|To Gumball and Darwin}} Don't you hate it when people eat noisily cause I do. I'm so like you in that way. Hey! We should totally go on an adventure where we like tell people off for their bad habits but learn that everyone should be themselves, and then we hug! {{d|event|Sarah holds her hands up, signifying a hug, then gets up and walks to Tina}} Hey! Me and my BFFs, Gumball and Darwin think that maybe you should stop mouth breathing. It's not very dignifying and it's making the cafeteria moist. But we forgive you, because it's important for you to be you. {{d|event|Does the hugging gesture towards Gumball and Darwin again}}

::{{d|event|Tina growls}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: How about we just have lunch?

:{{d|Sarah}}: {{d|event|Squeals}} Yeah, sure. No problem. Can I sit here? {{d|event|Whispery voice}} At your table?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah. Whatever.

::{{d|event|Sarah sits and melts excitedly. Then she stays still for a moment while the other two eat. Suddenly she talks to them again}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: So, now we sit together at lunch. I guess we need to work on our dynamic.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Wuh?

:{{d|Sarah}}: Yeah, since I moved school to be near you guys, I haven't figured out where I fit in. 'Cuz am I like, the kooky one?

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin shrug. Sarah is then seen wearing white cat ears with whiskers, purple eye lids, light blue lips and playing a ukulele}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Kooky Kooky Kooky Kooky Kooky Kooky Koo-ky-Koo...

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin stare questioningly}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} No?

::{{d|event|Sarah is then seen wearing gigantic glasses, and her eyes look bigger}}

::{{d|Sarah}}: Okay so maybe I'm like the {{d|event|Rubs her left shoulder}} nerdy insecure one, but then I take my glasses off, and I'm like super cute.

::{{d|event|Sarah take her glasses off, and spins her head like hair. Her face becomes a mess}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Eh? {{d|event|Rearrages her face to normal}} Or maybe I'm just the girl next door who's always been there for you, but you're too foolish to realize is perfect for you.

:{{d|Darwin}}: But you don't live next door.

:{{d|Sarah}}: {{d|event|Whispers}} I can move! But of course I couldn't do that because then you both would have to fight over me. {{d|event|Squeals}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, at the moment you're more like... the insanely obsessive one.

:{{d|Sarah}}: The insanely obsessive one! I can {{d|event|Slams the table}} totally do that.

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, no, no! I didn't mean I wanted—

:{{d|Sarah}}: And I'll be really creepy, and you'll be really scared. But in your final moments, you'll realize that we're meant to be.

:{{d|Gumball}}: My final moments? What does that mean? I'm not sure I'm comfortable with you following us.

:{{d|Sarah}}: Don't worry. {{d|event|Whispery voice}} You'll never see me.

::{{d|event|As she slowly steps away, the audio recorder plays}}

:{{d|Audio Recorder}}: {{d|event|Sarah’s voice whispers}} Best friends. Best friends. Best fr—

::{{d|event|The tape suddenly concludes. Sarah’s hand comes back on screen, quickly flipping to the tape's other side, then she leaves again}}

:{{d|Audio Recorder}}: —iends. Best friends. Best friends. Best friends. Best friends.

::{{d|event|Screen fades to black}}

==Sarah's Video==
::{{d|event|The video begins with Sarah removing the lens from the camera, and it focuses on Gumball in his house. Gumball takes his shirt off, sees Sarah, and shuts the blinds. The video continues, showing various scenes of Sarah stalking Gumball and Darwin throughout their lives}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: ''For a very long time''

::''I've watched you from afar''


::''Hunched in your closet''

::''Or strapped beneath your car''

::''I treasured all the stories''

::''The three of us share''

::''Wherever you are''

::''I'll always be there''

::''When you were alone''

::''I was there too''

::''Behind the shower curtain''

::''And you never knew''

::''I dressed in your clothes''

::''And breathed in your air''

::''I watched you both sleep''

::''And nuzzled your hair''

::''It helps that your bedroom has places to hide''

::''And the windows don't lock''

::''So I can get inside''

::''I've waited so long''

::''To be part of your life''

::''And one day one of you''

::''Will call me his wife!''

::{{d|event|The video ends, and the scene cuts to a stunned Gumball and Darwin in the classroom. They have watched it on the school TV, and they freak out for several seconds}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I think we need to have a reasonable conversation with this young lady.

== In the Hallway ==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin walk along the hallway}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Where is she? We've been looking for two hours now.

::{{d|event|They come across a seemingly stunned Mr. Small, paying great attention to a mural by the hallway}}

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​: Oh man… not cool…

:{{d|Gumball}}: You okay, Mr. Small? Why are you looking at that painting that way?

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​: {{d|event|Sighs in relief}} Thank mother earth! You can see it too.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Mouthing to Darwin}} Wow.

::{{d|event|Mr. Small leans closer to the painting. A part of the painting that looks like an ice cream (which is obviously Sarah) opens its eyes, and startles Mr. Small. Sarah quickly closes her eyes, and continues camouflaging within the painting}}

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​: {{d|event|Whispering}} Did you see that?

:{{d|Darwin}}: See what?

::{{d|event|Mr. Small pokes Sarah. Sarah reveals her face, and screams. Mr. Small screams, followed by Gumball and Darwin screaming. Then Mr. Small chuckles silently in relief. Sarah runs away}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sarah! Wait!

::{{d|event|The brothers take off after her trail. Sarah is trapped in the dead end of a hallway, and the brothers corner her. Sarah hears them, gasps, and pretends to be distressed as they arrive}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sarah, listen—

:{{d|Sarah}}: I know what you're gonna say. I'm sorry about the hair.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Eh-what? What hair? {{d|event|He turns around, revealing a spot of shaved hear behind his head}} Is there something wrong with my hair?

:{{d|Sarah}}: Nooooo. {{d|event|Smiles}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sarah, this whole… thing… isn't really working out.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah. It's not you. It's us.

:{{d|Gumball}}: By which we mean it's you.

:{{d|Sarah}}: Wait! Don't you want to see what's inside my locker?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Is this another one of your tricks? Why would we want to see inside your locker?

:{{d|Sarah}}: Because this is the part of the story where you realize maybe I do all this…because I'm {{d|event|Sadly opens locker}} lonely.

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, Sarah. This is the part of the story where you realize there ''is'' no story, and you'll leave us alone.

:{{d|Sarah}}: Oh. {{d|event|Holding in tears}} Y-yeah. Sure. {{d|event|Walks away}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, look at this.

::{{d|event|They look at various pieces of paper in Sarah's locker. There are papers with Gumball and Darwin drawn on them}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: "The first people who spoke to me at Elmore Junior High." And this, "The coolest kids in school: Gumball and Darwin."

::{{d|event|Gumball sees Darwin drawn as a tall person, while he (Gumball) is dwarfed in comparison, drawn beside the tall Darwin. At this, he begins examining his size, while Darwin continues reading}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: "The only people who really know me." Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I know right? ''I'm definitely taller than you!'' And if my eyes were that close together, I'd be a cyclops!

:{{d|Darwin}}: No! She really cares about us, but we just pushed her away. Look at this! {{d|event|Grabs book, and shows it to Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: "The Amazing Adventures of Gumball, Darwin, and Sarah." Oh man. All she ever wanted was to be included.

:{{d|Darwin}}:{{d|event|Nods sadly, then opens book}} This…this is today. Here's us at lunchtime.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh yeah.{{d|event|Points at his hand in the drawing}} Look at that hand, it's like a big thumb.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Well, hands are difficult to draw. {{d|event|Flips page}} Here's us watching the video. {{d|event|Flips}} And here's Sarah walking off just a second ago. I wonder what happens next. {{d|event|Flips page again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hm. Well, whatever it is I hope she goes to art school.

:{{d|Darwin}}: No. You say "We're her only friends, we have to do whatever it takes to make her happy."

:{{d|Gumball}}: We're her ''only'' friends!? We have to do whatever it takes to make her happy!

::{{d|event|They both gasp}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Right! How do we do it?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Alright, here.

==At the Rooftop==
::{{d|event|Sarah leans on the edge of the school building, clearly saddened. Gumball bursts through a door}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sarah! You shall not be alone!

:{{d|Sarah}}: It's alright guys. You don't have to do this.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yes I do, Sarah! I have been touched by the beauty of your art, and now {{d|event|Blushes, and face becomes anime-style}} I think I love you.

:{{d|Darwin}}: No! You cannot love her {{d|event|Glances at Sarah's book for lines}} for I love her more! She's beautiful, and yellow, and runny! {{d|event|Checks lines}} And funny!

:{{d|Sarah}}: Forget it guys.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin smile encouragingly}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aw, come on!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Come on.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Come ooon!

:{{d|Gumball}}: C'mooon!

:{{d|Darwin}}: C'mon!

:{{d|Gumball}}: C'mon!

:{{d|Darwin}}: C'mon!

:{{d|Gumball}}: C'mon!

:{{d|Darwin}}: C'mon!

:{{d|Gumball}}: C'mon!

:{{d|Darwin}}: C'mon!

:{{d|Gumball}}: C'mon!

::{{d|event|Sarah begins to smile}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Come—

:{{d|Gumball}}: On!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Come—

:{{d|Gumball}}: On!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Come—

:{{d|Gumball}}: On!

:{{d|Sarah}}: {{d|event|Going with the act}} Please don't fight over me!

:{{d|Gumball}}: There's no other way. You are too beautiful to be shared!

:{{d|Sarah}}: {{d|event|Excited squeal}} Oh, wait. {{d|event|Takes out recorder, and plays music}}

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin take stances against each other, but instead jump cheerily along each other repeatedly}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Uh guys? What are you doing?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I don't know. It's the dancing you drew.

:{{d|Sarah}}: That's fighting.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Ohhh.

::{{d|event|Gumball slaps Darwin, and they start slapping each other. Darwin holds Gumball's head}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: You only love her because she's beautiful! I love her because her heart shines like diamonds! {{d|event|Hits Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Pretends to be hurt very bad, then mimics hitting Darwin with a flying kick}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Falls down, and pretends be hit}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: {{d|event|Pleased, then stops smiling}} What are you doing?

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are hugging warmly}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, what now? It says they snuggle for a while!

:{{d|Sarah}}: No, it says they ''struggle'' for a while.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, it's not my fault your girly writing is so curly.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Looks through book}} Dude, this is the part where you rip your shirt.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Whaaat?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Shows Gumball}} It's right here.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Really?

:{{d|Sarah}}: Oh yeah. It's right there.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|In the act}} Let her go, or prove that you understand true love!

:{{d|Gumball}}: My beating heart is the only proof I need. Look!

::{{d|event|Attempts to rip shirt off, but fails. He struggles with it for a while, and in the end just takes it off}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Look!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Checks book, and sees muscular Gumball with abs}} Meh. That'll have to do. Now do your line.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|To Sarah}} You don't know how long I've waited for you!

:{{d|Sarah}}: I don't know which path to choose!

:{{d|Gumball}}: So real, I can feel it.

::{{d|event|Silence for a while. Sarah (with her eyes closed) peeks at Darwin. Darwin realizes that he missed his cue}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What? Oh! {{d|event|Glances at book; speaks in the act}} NOOOOO!

::{{d|event|He tackles Gumball, and they "struggle" again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: What happens next?

::{{d|event|Darwin flips the page of the nearby book, and they both see the next scene}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: We have to ''jump''?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah. We're doing this for Sarah in the name of friendship.

:{{d|Gumball}}: And pity.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah, that too.

::{{d|event|They run towards the building's edge}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Ahhhhhhh-I don't think sooo-ahhh!

::{{d|event|They run towards the building's external staircase instead}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Ahhhhhhh-

:{{d|Gumball}}: This is much safer-ahhhh…

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin drop to the floor}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Stop! Don't hurt yourselves for me!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Helps Darwin up}} You okay?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah. Scratched my knee, but I'm okay.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Good.

::{{d|event|They resume "fighting." Darwin pushes Gumball towards an air conditioning exhaust fan}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: You have to choose between us!

:{{d|Sarah}}: I can't. I love you both!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Then one of us must go!

:{{d|Sarah}}: Hold on, I got a track for this. {{d|event|Plays another music track}}

::{{d|event|Gumball pulls Darwin, and now threatens to push him against the exhaust fan (though the fan has a protective screen). As Gumball talks, Darwin is pushed nearer to the fan}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Goodbye, my brother. I'm sorry it had to end this way.

:{{d|Darwin}}: It's not the end, for my love will live on forever!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Goodbye! {{d|event|Out of act}} Okay, you're supposed to intervene here.

:{{d|Sarah}}: I can't! The tape is stuck, the music won't stop.

:{{d|Darwin}}: What!? What do we do then?

:{{d|Sarah}}: Yeah-you-keep going! I'll be a sec.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Are you kidding me? Do something!

:{{d|Sarah}}: Okay. Just uh… {{d|event|Fumbles with recorder}} Almost got it!

::{{d|event|Darwin comes closer to the exhaust fan. Gumball goes to Sarah, and throes the tape away. The music is cut off}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: Stop! I can't bear to see you destroy each other.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, so what happens next?

::{{d|event|Darwin looks through the book}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hmmm… We agree that you get her at Monday through Thursday, and I get her Friday and the weekends, and we "live happily ever after."

:{{d|Gumball}}: I think I have a better Idea.

::{{d|event|Gumball, takes the book, and shreds it with the exhaust fan}}

:{{d|Sarah}}: {{d|event|Sings show's ending song}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hm?

:{{d|Gumball}}: What is that? What are you doing?

::{{d|event|Episode ends}}
