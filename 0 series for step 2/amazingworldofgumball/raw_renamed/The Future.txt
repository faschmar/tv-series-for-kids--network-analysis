==Where Is Banana Barbara?==

::{{d|event|The episode starts with a shot of the Bananas' house, with light coming from the garage. Creepy music plays as the screen shows many of Banana Barbara's paintings, eventually showing one that just static}}

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: {{d|event|Hangs a painting of herself hanging it}} There. Finished.

::{{d|event|Banana Barbara notices a shadow in her painting}}

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Hmm? {{d|event|Looks closer}} Hmm? {{d|event|Looks closer. She sees a silhouette and looks behind her}} Ah.

::{{d|event|Rob grabs Banana Barbara}}

::{{d|e|Cuts to black. Captions read "One Week Later"}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Hey… do you mind if I put a picture in your window? It's for my mom… she's missing.

:{{d|Larry}}: Oh, gosh. Go ahead.

::{{d|event|Banana Joe tries to pin the picture onto the glass door with a hammer, but ends up breaking it}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Thank you. {{d|e|Leaves}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Maybe we need a different pinning method.

::{{d|e|Banana Joe looks behind him and notices multiple broken windows}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Yeah, well, maybe we need a different poster. This photo isn't even of her! {{d|event|Holds up the poster}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry, but it's just advertising 101, man. That's what sells. Babes and babies.

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: And what kind of slogan is this? "Banana Barbara, 20% off 'cause she's past her best?!" That's my mom you're talking about!

:{{d|Darwin}}: I told you we should've gone with "Banana Barbara, the ripest on the market."

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Look, I'm sorry. It's just, she's never been missing this long before.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry man, look, where did you find her the other times?

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Well, she once spent half of December in a Christmas stocking.

::{{d|event|Scene flashes back to December. Santa Claus falls down the chimney and wipes dust off of his suit}}

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: {{d|event|Suddenly pops out from inside the stocking}} You'll find my tooth under the pillow!

:{{d|Santa Claus}}: AHHHH! I'm not the tooth fairy, Barbara.

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: I never said you weeeeere..... {{d|event|Goes back into the stocking}}

::{{d|e|Scene then flashes to a video where Barbara falls down a waterfall}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: {{d|event|Voice-over}} Another time we lost her at the airport, and we found her in a Japanese Karaoke video. 

::{{d|e|Scene flashes back to the present}} 

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Then there was the time we found her playing a chicken in a TV show.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Wow, I knew she could paint the future, but I didn't know she could act!

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: It was more of a musical act.

::{{d|event|Scene flashes to Banana Barbara playing a rubber chicken as a bagpipe to the tune of 'Scotland the Brave'}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Where is she?

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin hug Banana Joe}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry, buddy, we will find your mom!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Whispers}} How?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispers}} I have no idea.

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin, and Banana Joe are walking down the street}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: So, what does Barbrama Barnara usually do during the day?

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Dude, her name is Banana Barbara.

:{{d|Gumball}}: That's what I just said, Bamarbra Banambram.

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Barbara!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Brabambra.

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Barbara!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Spell it.

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: B-A-R-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-N-R-A Double A-R-A-B-A.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, Barbara. Got it!

:{{d|Darwin}}: So, what does your mom usually do?

==Barbara's Hobbies==
:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Hmm… shopping.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to a flashback in the supermarket}}

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: How much?

:{{d|Larry}}: For what?

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Everything you're wearing right now.

:{{d|Larry}}: {{d|event|Confused}} What?

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: One hundred million dollars.

:{{d|Larry}}: Uh-uh-uh…

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Tick, tock, Larry. Tick, tock.

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: {{d|event|Voice-over}} Charity work.

::{{d|event|Flashback. In a bus, Banana Barbara cuts off Byrdie's hair and puts it on Tony's head}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: {{d|event|Voice-over}} Gossiping.

::{{d|event|Flashback, Felicity and Siciliana are at the park, with Siciliana taking her baby for a stroll}}

:{{d|Felicity}}: Oh, what a pretty baby!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: She said, while in truth she thought it looked like an old monkey's kneecap.

::{{d|e|Siciliana gets mad and Felicity smiles nervously. Cut back to the present}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Do you think it's possible that maybe your mom suffers from some kind of head problem?

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: I don't know about suffers, she seems to really enjoy it. But, yeah, she's full blown bananas. She wasn't always like that, though. It sort of happened a few years ago...

::{{d|event|Flashback to a few years ago. Barbara is carrying a large stack of papers}}

:{{d|Paperball}}: Barbara, coffee!

::{{d|event|Barbara drops the stack of papers and pours him a cup of coffee}}

:{{d|Paperball}}: Too hot!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Sorry. {{d|event|Blows on the coffee to cool it down}}

:{{d|Paperball}}: {{d|event|Takes a sip of coffee}} Too cold!

::{{d|event|Barbara pours more coffee into the cup}}

:{{d|Paperball}}: {{d|event|Takes a sip of coffee and throws the coffee cup}} Too perfect! Barbara, I've got a song stuck in my head, what is it?

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Okay, uh, so, are you gonna hum it, or…?

:{{d|Paperball}}: Darn it, Barbara, I'm not a juke box, figure it out yourself!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Right away, sir! {{d|event|Starts to run}}

:{{d|Paperball}}: Barbara, move my 4pm to 10am!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: It's already 3:00 in the afternoon, sir.

:{{d|Paperball}}: Figure it out, Barbara!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Sure! {{d|event|Whispers and writes}} Invent time travel.

:{{d|Paperball}}: Barbara, the sun's glaring on my screen!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: I'll close the blinds. {{d|event|Starts to close the blinds}}

:{{d|Paperball}}: No, I hate the blinds! Move the sun!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Uh, shoo, shoo! 

::{{d|e|The Sun looks at her confused}}

:{{d|Paperball}}: Barbara! Hurry up and bedredge my heddegedy!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: I'm not sure those are real words, sir.

:{{d|Paperball}}: Don't question my management, that's 100 off your pay!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Sir, I'm an intern.

:{{d|Paperball}}: Then you owe me 100 dollars! Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! {{d|event|In slow-motion}} Barbara! {{d|event|Slower}} Barbara.

::{{d|e|Scene cuts back to the present}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: The doctor said it's called a burn-out. It happens when you get too stressed at work. Though, I think hers was quite a big one.

:{{d|Paperball}}: Barbara!

::{{d|event|Paperball's voice echoes and Banana Barbara spits lasers through her mouth and eyes, which makes Paperball's desk go flying out the window}}

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: I feel like painting. {{d|event|Head explodes}}

::{{d|e|Flashback ends}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, so that's why she always wears a bow!

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: It just holds together whatever's left up there.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Eh, anyway, how do you catch a banana?

==Thinking Like Bananas==
:{{d|Darwin}}: You make the mating call of a banana! {{d|event|Makes the "mating call" of a banana (which is just silence)}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, dude. You gotta think like a banana!

::{{d|event|Darwin and Banana Joe shrug}}

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin, and Banana Joe all start acting like a banana and start dancing. The scene cuts to a junkyard. Banana Barbara is painting static in a room}}

:{{d|Rob}}: No. No, no, no! The future! I want you to paint the future! What happens next?! That can't just be the end! I need your power! {{d|event|Sweetly}} Heh, now, come on, Barbara, one more time! Work your magic, paint the future. 

::{{d|event|Banana Barbara starts painting}} 

:{{d|Rob}}: That's it. {{d|event|Sees that she's painting static}} Ugh. No, no more static! {{d|event|Throws the painting away}} I'm gonna give you one last chance, you're gonna tell me everything you know.

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Okay... 

::{{d|event|Rob starts looking at her excitingly}} 

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Your stomach produces a new layer of mucus every two weeks, otherwise it'll digest itself. A blue whale's toot bubble is large enough to enclose a horse.

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: No! NO! {{d|event|Breathes heavily}}

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: {{d|event|Whispers}} Hippopotamus milk is pink.

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: ''You'' are gonna take ''this''… {{d|event|Gives Barbara a paint brush}} and you're gonna paint what happens next! Otherwise, that face of yours won't be so… a-peel-ing. Wait, that came out way lamer than I expected. JUST PAINT!

::{{d|event|Rob storms off and kicks an empty paint can, then kicks a much heavier paint can and starts limping. Meanwhile, Gumball, Darwin, and Banana Joe are dancing around Elmore}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: And how does this help us find my mom?

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's simple, if we follow her mental process, we'll retrace her steps.

:{{d|Darwin}}: So what would she do next?

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: She'd definitely be licking the public payphone receiver.

::{{d|event|Gumball licks the phone}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Disgusted}} Ehh…

:{{d|Darwin}}: How'd it taste?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Like a brown rainbow. {{d|e|Gumball's shadow starts abnormally moving}} Huh, it's working, though. I am definitely seeing things.

::{{d|event|Gumball's shadow points to the left}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Me too! It's like that shadow is pointing the way.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Now, what would your mother do?

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Definitely go in the opposite direction.

::{{d|event|Gumball's shadow gets frustrated, then follows along. Barbara is painting Gumball's shadow pointing the way}}

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: Hey, Barbara. You better get going, otherwise… {{d|event|Tries to eat a regular banana but accidentally pushes it into his eye}} Ow! Sorry, it's just with only the one eye I've got really bad depth perception and, {{d|event|Murmurs}} um… you know… GET BACK TO WORK! {{D|event|Storms off}}

::{{d|event|Barbara paints a new cloud in a painting that points the way. The new cloud appears in real life above Gumball, Darwin, and Banana Joe}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wait, look! {{d|event|Points to the sky}} my finger.

:{{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Banana Joe}}: Ooh!

::{{d|event|The three of them keep walking}}

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Oh, uh…

::{{d|event|Barbara paints a graffiti on a wall that has the junkyard with a speech bubble that says, "I'm here Banana Joe"}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Look at that speech bubble! "I'm here, Banana Joe".

:{{d|Gumball}}: Of course, Barbara must be inside this wall!

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin, and Banana Joe try to go inside the wall, cow sounds play whenever one of them try and fail}}

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: NO! Ah…

::{{d|event|Barbara paints a portal on a painting with Gumball, Darwin, and Banana Joe, then on a painting of Rob watching  Barbara paint, which appears in real life}}

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Gasps}} You can… you can alter the paintings! You can change the future!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Only what's left.

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: What does that mean?! Talk to me, Barbara, come on, spill your guts!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Okay. {{d|event|Tries to literally puke out her guts}}

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: Ugh. Why you…! 

::{{d|event|Rob tries to hit Banana Barbara with a crowbar, but stops himself and hits it on the ground, he then starts breathing heavily}}

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin, and Banana Joe fall through the portal}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Mom!

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: Gumball.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Rob.

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: Names!

==The Fight==
::{{d|event|Rob raises the crowbar}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: You made a big mistake, my friend, you might've thought I was a harmless clown, a joke, but you messed with the wrong guy's mother! {{d|event|Rips his skin off}}

::{{d|event|Rob hits Joe with a pipe and he falls down, Gumball and Darwin run towards Rob. Rob paints a crack in the floor between him, Gumball, and Darwin. Objects fall from the ceiling, nearly hitting them. Gumball and Darwin scream as a car falls on them, and they pop out of the hood. They feel their heads to make sure everything's still there, and sigh with relief when they feel everything's all there. Rob paints a bazooka, which he uses to shoot bombs at Gumball and Darwin, he misses, but the explosion knocks out Darwin}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Darwin!

::{{d|event|Rob tries to shoot Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, no, no…

::{{d|event|As Gumball is walking backwards, he steps on the button of a remote that controls a giant magnet, which makes everything metal go towards it, including Rob's bazooka}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ha!

::{{d|event|Gumball realizes a bunch of dangerous tools are flying towards him, which he manages to dodge. Then a giant bus comes towards him, which he jumps into, and the bus explodes as he's jumping out, then he runs toward Rob again. Rob paints water, which covers the whole floor. Then Gumball sees a shark fin swimming towards him, so he panics and tries to swim backwards. When it hits him, he lifts it up and realized it's only a fin}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ha ha, you should've drawn the rest of the…

::{{d|event|Rob shows Gumball that he finished drawing the shark, and the fin becomes a whole shark. Gumball jumps off of the shark and onto Rob}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Barbara, do something!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: {{d|event|Singing while patting head and stomach}} Bonk. {{d|event|Clicks tongue twice}} Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk. {{d|event|Clicks tongue twice}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, I meant something helpful, Barbara.

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: Just walk away! This is more important than you!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Paint him out, erase him!

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: NO!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on..

::{{d|event|Rob and Gumball fight over the paintbrush and end up erasing things}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: HEY!

::{{d|event|Rob and Gumball stop as everyone's focus is directed towards Joe}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: What did I say about underestimating m...uh!

::{{d|event|Darwin uses Joe as a baseball bat and hits Rob}}

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Breathes heavily}} I'm warning you…

:{{d|Gumball}}: Barbara, the brush! 

::{{d|event|Barbara uses the brush to erase Rob and his body gets erased in half}}

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: No… no!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin continue to erase Rob}}

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: No, no, you don't get it!

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: You're gonna get it.

::{{d|event|Banana Joe continues to erase Rob}}

:{{d|Rob}}​​​​​​​: Wait, no, please, no! {{d|event|Tries to run up to them}}

::{{d|event|Rob's voice echoes as he gets fully erased. Everyone stares at where Rob stood in shock. Gumball walks over and picks up the remainder of the crowbar Rob held}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Mom! I missed you.

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: And I miss hardcore hip hop.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} I guess all's well that ends well.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Except for the guy we kinda straight up erased from existence.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, I feel pretty bad about it right now, but you know, maybe we'll laugh about it later! Let's try it. {{d|event|Clears throat}} Hey, remember when we straight up erased that guy from existence?

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin start laughing}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, no. Barbara, can you paint him back into existence, please?

::{{d|event|Barbara starts painting}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, and can you give him something lame, like a goatee or a third nostril or something?

::{{d|event|Barbara paints a pigtail onto a painting of Rob falling into the Void}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Haha! Perfect. {{d|event|He and Darwin begin to walk away}} See ya in the future, Rob!

:{{d|Banana Barbara}}: {{d|event|Slowly turns around, smiling as she speaks}} But there is no future.

::{{d|event|The screen changes to static as Superintendent Evil's face is barely shown. Episode ends.}}
