==A Principal Without Diploma==
:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Can you please explain ''why'' your clothes are painted on?

:{{d|event|Cut to Gumball and Darwin, who are naked and have colored on themselves to make it look like their clothes}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Well, you see, Principal Brown, the thing is...

::{{d|event|Flashback}}

:{{d|richard}}: Okay, Nicole said I needed to use a quarter cup of washing liquid and a half cup of softener, and set it for exactly one hour and two minutes. Wait three seconds... and go!

:{{d|gumball}}: Did you just put the clothes in the dishwasher?

:{{d|richard}}: Yeah.

:{{d|darwin}}: Then what did you do with the dishes?

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the washing machine, "washing" the dishes}}

::{{d|event|End of flashback}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Let's just say we like to dress sharp, but not that sharp.

:{{d|darwin}}: We thought no one would notice. What gave it away? Did we mess up the back part?

::{{d|event|Gumball turns around revealing they have not painted their backsides}}

:{{d|brown}}: No, it was the PIXELATED PART! Surely, you must realize you can't walk around in public looking like you feel asleep at an art student's party! Do I really need to add another Watterson amendment to the school's rule book?! {{D|event|He pulls out a heavy rule book from his drawer, panting}}

:{{d|gumball}}: But what's the difference? Sure, the clothes are fake, but they're just as good as the real ones.

:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Inhales deeply}} Let me make this clear for you. If you wear fake clothes, you're NAKED, which is bad! If you pay with fake money, you're A CROOK, which is bad! If you eat fake meat, you're A VEGETARIAN! Which I... Guess is not that bad, just a bit boring. I mean, it's good for the animals, I guess, but they always have a smug, superior attitude, and for some reason, the men are always topless and playing bongos in the park. That and the sandals just makes me want to eat raw liver.

::{{d|event|While he talks, Gumball observes the diploma on Principal Brown's wall. He sees it is just painted on the wall and has a banana sticker for a seal of authenticity}}

:{{d|gumball}}: What if you have a fake diploma?

:{{d|brown}}: Well, then you're a— {{d|event|Gasps, then slowly looks at his "diploma"}}

:{{d|gumball}}: A ''principal'', Principal Brown?

:{{d|brown}}: Uh, what gave it away? {{D|event|worried}}

:{{d|gumball}}: I don't know. {{D|event|He walks towards the fake diploma, followed by Darwin and Principal Brown}} Maybe the fact you painted it directly onto the wall or probably because you used a banana sticker as a seal of authenticity. {{D|event|Peels off banana sticker}}

:{{d|darwin}}: Wait, so do you have a diploma or not?

:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Chuckles}} Kids, I am a principal, and you need a diploma to be a principal.

:{{d|gumball}}: Is that a yes or a no?

:{{d|brown}}: It is.

:{{d|gumball}} and {{d|darwin}}: OH MY GOSH, YOU'RE A FRAUD!

:{{d|brown}}: All right, you got me, but I have one more trick up my sleeve. {{d|event|Crying}} PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE, PLEASE! HAVE SOME PITY ON ME, PLEASE!

:{{d|gumball}}: Don't worry, Principal Brown. We wouldn't want anything bad to happen to you.

:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Menacingly}} Oh I see. It's gonna be like that, is it?

:{{d|darwin}}: Yeah, it's gonna be like that.

:{{d|brown}}: Oh I get it.

:{{d|gumball}}: Uh, do you? 'Cause it doesn't seem like you do. {{d|event|He faces Gumball and sticks out his nose}}

:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Grunts}} I got the message.

:{{d|gumball}}: Riiight...

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin leave the Principal's office}}

:{{d|darwin}}: I'm still not sure he understood.

:{{d|gumball}}: Yeah, me neither, but that seemed like it was gonna go on forever.

::{{d|event|Principal Brown drags Gumball and Darwin back into the office}}

:{{d|brown}}: O-okay, so, what do you want? Just name it. Anything, anything! Uh, do you want me to bump your grades? I can do that! I can bump your grades! I can do that!

:{{d|gumball}}: Uh, no thanks. We'd be forced to maintain that kind of standard forever. I think it's best if we stay in our comfort zone.

::{{d|event|Gumball raises his arm but Darwin lowers it a bit}}

:{{d|darwin}}: Just above fail.

:{{d|brown}}: Uh, what about sick notes?! I can fix you up!

:{{d|gumball}}: Uh, t-thanks, but I don't think I'd feel good about everyone believing I've got mange.

:{{d|brown}}: You're making this tough. {{D|event|He rips open the front part of his fur, revealing a jacket of sorts full of hall passes}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Ugh!

:{{d|brown}}: What about hall passes?

:{{d|gumball}}: Doesn't that hurt?

:{{d|brown}}: Yes, every time.

:{{d|gumball}}: I... think we're gonna pass on the passes. Please cover up.

:{{d|brown}}: I see. {{d|event|Sticks his fur back on}} Ah, then I've got just what you need. Behold the chest of confiscated treasures. {{d|event|Opens the case}} You may pick anything you like. These fireworks are illegal, even in Russia.

:{{d|gumball}}: Seems like a lot of this stuff should require a license.

:{{d|darwin}}: Who buys stuff like this?

:{{d|gumball}}: People with fingers to spare.

:{{d|darwin}}: But as you can see, I don't.

:{{d|gumball}}: Thanks, but no thanks.

::{{d|event|Gumball closes the case and they leave the office}}

:{{d|brown}}: No, no, no, no, wait! I-I've got bottle rockets, cherry bombs, and this big one! I-I don't even know what it does! {{d|event|Start screaming}}

::{{d|event|The fireworks explode, destroying the office. A ringing sound is heard, which turns out to be a phone}}

:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Hangs up the phone}} They can't be bought, they're bound to denounce me. I need to find another angle!

::{{d|event|Principal Brown's hair starts to burn}}

==Hip With The Kids==
{{d|event|At the cafeteria}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Dude, check this out! 

::{{d|event|Gumball catapults a pea in the air and gets launched directly into his mouth}} 

:{{d|gumball}}: That's right, baby!

:{{d|darwin}}: It would've been more impressive if you succeeded the first time.

::{{d|event|Ceiling is shown, covered in peas. All students are annoyed at being covered in them}}

:{{d|leslie}}​​​​: Hmph! {{d|event|Almost trips on the floor}}

::{{d|event|Principal brown comes in the cafeteria, dressed in a hip-hop outfit and bling}}

:{{d|brown}}: Swag! Rap music!

:{{d|gumball}}: What the what?!

:{{d|brown}}: Piercings! YOLO! Hashtag! MP3! Tweets! Selfies! Skinny jeans! L-O-

::{{d|event|Mr. Small smacks Principal Brown with a tray}}

:{{d|small}}​​​​: I'm sorry, Principal Brown, but you look like such a jerk that even a granola-crunching pacifist like me had to do something about it.

:{{d|brown}}: Fair enough.

::{{d|event|Principal brown crawls up to Gumball and Darwin's table}}

:{{d|darwin}}: What are you doing, Principal Brown?

:{{d|brown}}: Well, I thought if I was cool and became your friend, you wouldn't tell anyone.

:{{d|gumball}}: Okay. Well, it's a bit weird, but, yeah, I guess we could be friends if it makes you feel better.

:{{d|brown}}: That is so refrigerated! You guys are riddled with disease! We should very much be suspended in an exterior environment.

:{{d|gumball}}: Did you mean to tell us that that's cool, we're sick, and we should totally hang out together?

:{{d|brown}}: For sure! Uh, izzle.

==Awkward Camping==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the inside of a tent at Gumball and Darwin's house. Gumball clears his throat and inhales deeply, as if about to say something, but then sighs}}

:{{d|brown}}: So, now we're friends. Do you want to share some girl stories?

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin inhale sharply}}

:{{d|gumball}}: AWKWARD, AWKWARD, AWKWARD!

:{{d|darwin}}: YEP, YEP, YEP!

:{{d|brown}}: Okay, I'll go first. I must say, things are going pretty well with me and Miss Simian.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin inhale sharply again}}

:{{d|brown}}: Oh, come now. Just because you're students and I'm your principal, it doesn't mean we can't share a few— AAAND I finally heard myself out loud. Goodbye.

::{{d|event|Principal Brown jumps through the window, trapped inside the tent, leaving only Gumball and Darwin, and crashes off-screen}}

:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} It's okay! I landed in a dumpster!

==Blackmailing and Blackshaming==
::{{d|event|Gumball finds a note in his locker from Principal Brown}}

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Reading the note}} "Please don't tell." Uh, he attached twenty dollars to the note. How cheap does he think we are?

::{{d|event|Another note comes out, then another, until twenty dollar notes are pouring out rapidly. When they stop, Gumball begins to say something, but Darwin cuts him off}}

:{{d|darwin}}: No, you can't even remember what he doesn't want us to talk about!

::{{d|event|Gumball sighs, then suddenly Principal Brown’s muffled voice comes from inside a nearby locker}}

:{{d|brown}}: If money isn't enough to stop you revealing I don't have a diploma...

::{{d|event|Gumball opens the locker by snapping his fingers, and Principal Brown gets out}}

:{{d|brown}}: I've got a little dirt of my own. What if this were to go public? {{d|event|He shows a picture of Gumball in goth clothes and Darwin in 90s clothes}}

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Look Principal Brown, first, that was a phase, and secondly, we've felt ashamed so many times in life that I think we're now incapable of feeling it, as in chemically.

:{{d|darwin}}: The doctor says we've run out of shame-osterone. Let me show you. 

::{{d|event|Darwin opens up Gumball's head and takes out various glands from his brains}} 

:{{d|darwin}}: As you can see, the brain is composed of many sections dedicated to emotion. Here is anger. Here is sadness. This here... 

::{{d|event|The gland makes a weird relaxed gesture}}

:{{d|darwin}}: We just don't know. And finally, this is the shame gland. 

::{{d|event|The camera zooms on the shame gland's wrinkled face}}

:{{d|darwin}}: As you can see, It's pretty dried out.

::{{d|event|Principal Brown sighs and walks away}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Dude, could you put me back together, please?

:{{d|darwin}}: Sure.

::{{d|event|Darwin puts the glands back together in a messy way and puts Gumball's head back to his body}}

:{{d|darwin}}: How's that?

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|In Danish}} Jeg tror der er et eller andet der er sat helt forkert sammen {{d|event|English: I think there's something that's put together completely wrong}} 

::{{d|event|Darwin shakes Gumball}} 

:{{d|gumball}}: Thanks. That's much better.

:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Over intercom}} Gumball and Darwin Watterson, please report to the Principal's office.

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} What does he want now?

==Spare Pair of Glasses==
::{{d|event|The kids are again in the Principal's office, with a safe next to them}}

:{{d|brown}}: Kids, I think I'm losing my mind.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin both sigh}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Finally!

:{{d|darwin}}: Well, at least you realize it's a problem.

:{{d|brown}}: I looked everywhere. I looked in the drawer. I looked under my desk, behind the bookshelf.

:{{d|gumball}}: Wait, what are we talking about here?

:{{d|brown}}: My glasses! I can't find my glasses.

:{{d|gumball}}: Uh, you're wearing them.

:{{d|brown}}: Oh, no, not these... My spare pair. I think they might be in this safe.

::{{d|event|Darwin crawls inside the safe}}

:{{d|gumball}}: You keep your spare glasses in a safe?

:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Muffled}} I can't see them!

:{{d|brown}}: Oh, no, no, no, they're right in the back. Just keep going further in.

::{{d|event|Principal Brown winks at the screen; Gumball looks at the screen and then back at Principal Brown}}

:{{d|gumball}}: You're gonna lock us in the safe, aren't you?

:{{d|brown}}: Uh, would you believe a "no?"

:{{d|gumball}}: Look, Principal Brown, this is ridiculous! If you keep wasting your time on us instead of doing your job, this place is gonna start falling apart!

::{{d|event|Rocky crashes through the ceiling}}

:{{d|rocky}}: Oh, sorry.

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Okay, you really want to do something for us?

:{{d|brown}}: Anything!

:{{d|gumball}}: Then you'll leave us alone?

:{{d|brown}}: Of course!

:{{d|gumball}}: Then just take care of the school!

:{{d|brown}}: Yes, yes, yes, of course. That's it, take care of the school, and all my problems will be solved. Thank you, Watterson! All I have to do is blow this place up!

:{{d|gumball}}: Exactly!

:{{d|darwin}}: All I could find was these. {{d|event|He holds up a pair of red high-heels}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Oh, well, that would explain the sound when he walks. WAIT, DID HE SAY BLOW UP THE SCHOOL?!

==Blowing up the School==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin start running down the hallway}}

:{{d|darwin}}: We need to raise the alarm!

:{{d|gumball}}: Are you crazy?! No one can know about this! There'd be complete panic! We just have to stop him before he blows up the school!

:{{d|leslie}}​​​: Who's gonna blow up the school?!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin stop}}

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Laughing}} No, no, we were just saying how the wind blows up the {{d|event|Mumbling}} Help me out here!

::{{d|event|Darwin kicks Leslie out of the school}}

:{{d|leslie}}​​​: {{d|event|Screams}} Whoa!

:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Sputters}} WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?!

:{{d|darwin}}: You said no one could know, and you winked at me!

:{{d|gumball}}: YEAH, BUT I WAS.... Uh, uh. Never mind. Let's go.

:{{d|brown}}: Rocky, can I have the keys to the boiler room? I'm gonna blow up the school.

:{{d|rocky}}: Eh, sure.

:{{d|brown}}: Uh, you'd better run.

:{{d|rocky}}: Oh, it's the little blue one! Sometimes it sticks, so you might need to give it a— PRINCIPAL BROWN'S GONNA BLOW UP THE SCHOOL?!

:{{d|gumball}}: No, no, no, no, no, that's not what he meant! It's {{d|event|Chuckles}} It's not what you... {{d|event|Chuckling nervously. Looks at Darwin, and gestures his head to Rocky}}

:{{d|event|Darwin runs to Rocky, and rapidly punches his stomach multiple times}}

:{{d|darwin}}: HI-YAH! HI-YAH! {{d|event|Shouting indistinctly}}

:{{d|rocky}}: Wait a minute. Are you trying to knock me ou— {{d|event|Faints}}

:{{d|brown}}: If there's no school, then there's nothing to lose!

:{{d|Coach}}: Excuse me, Principal Brown, I—

:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Walks over Coach}} Take the children outside, Coach. I'm gonna blow up the school.

:{{d|Coach}}: {{d|event|Pulls out hair from Principal Brown off of her tongue.}} Uh, wait, blow up what?

:{{d|gumball}}: Okay, okay, enough violence! I'll take care of her. I'm sorry, Coach. {{d|event|pinches her several times}}

:{{d|darwin}}: What's that?

:{{d|gumball}}: I'm trying to pinch a nerve cluster, but it's buried pretty deep.

:{{d|darwin}}: Oh, let me try something. Apparently, it works on cows. 

::{{d|event|Darwin pushes Coach. She then moos and falls over}}

:{{d|brown}}: I've got to blow this place up!

:{{d|small}}​​​: Principal Brown is gonna blow up the school?!

:{{d|gumball}}: Mr. Small, we can explain!

:{{d|small}}​​​: Hold on, kids. I need to make a symbolic gesture of protest. HALT IN THE NAME OF LOVE! {{d|event|Gets run over by Principal Brown}}

:{{d|brown}}: Once this place is gone, my reputation will be safe! Save yourself, Lucy! {{d|event|Hits the drywall}} Ohh! Oh, sorry. I thought that was another drywall. {{d|event|Hits the drywall again}} Ohh! And again. Everyone, evacuate the school!

::{{d|event|Everyone starts screaming. Principal Brown raises the alarm}}

:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Grunting}} Now all I have to do is increase the oxygen supply, shut off the carbon dioxide release valve, which should combine with the boiling H2O, kick-start a reaction, which will BLOW UP THE WHOLE SCHOOL!

:{{d|gumball}}: STOP! DON'T DO THIS!

:{{d|brown}}: SAVE YOURSELVES!

:{{d|gumball}}: YOU MISUNDERSTOOD US! We don't want you to blow up the school!

:{{d|brown}}: But it's the only solution!

:{{d|simian}}: Nigel, what is going on?!

:{{d|brown}}: Wait, it should've blown by now. Oh, yeah, it's because of chemistry that I failed my diploma.

:{{D|event|The teachers look confused, while Gumball and Darwin feel pitiful}}

:{{d|gumball}}: Tell them the truth, Principal Brown.

:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} I don't have a diploma. Your principal is nothing more than a... a fraud! I should go. But promise me you'll find a new principal to look after this place.

:{{d|darwin}}: But you are our principal.

:{{d|gumball}}: Or at least you were until you started worrying about that stupid diploma.

:{{d|simian}}: We all lie sometimes. I lied about my age to get this job. I'm not quite the spring chicken you think I am.

:{{d|small}}​​​: Hey, man, I'm not even a U.S citizen!

:{{d|Coach}}: And I'm not a woman! {{d|event|Everyone looks at her}} Who can say she's never lied on her résumé either.

:{{d|gumball}}: Haven't you been doing this job for twenty years? Surely, no one else is more qualified to be our principal than our principal.

:{{d|brown}}: You know what? You're right. I'm gonna get this place back on track starting right here, right now!

::{{d|event|The whole school explodes, everyone coughs}}

:{{d|brown}}: Oh, yes, sorry, it was mathematics that I failed. {{d|event|Faints}}
