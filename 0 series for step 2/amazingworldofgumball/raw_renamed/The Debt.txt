==On the Street==
::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin and Anais are on the sidewalk in front of the Robinsons' house}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: What do you wanna do today, Gumball?
:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm waiting right here for Mom to drive me to "Elmore Senior Talent Show." {{d|event|Looks at pamphlet}} Mr. Robinson's headlining.
:{{d|Anais}}: But it doesn't start for another ten hours.
:{{d|Darwin}}: And you're not invited. {{d|event|points at pamphlet, it reads: '''STRICTLY NO GUMBALL'''}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: I don't care! Tonight's the biggest night of Mr. Robinson's life and I ''have'' to be there!
::{{d|event|Camera changes to the Robinsons' car}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|exhales relaxed}} Tonight's the night, Margaret. This town is finally going to see the '''real''' Gaylord Robinson.
:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: {{d|event|grunts}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Why can't you ever be happy for me?...
::{{d|event|Camera changes back to Gumball, Darwin and Anais}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|points at car}} There he is now!
::{{d|event|The Robinsons' car passes by and then goes in reverse, Darwin and Anais get on the sidewalk}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|screams in fear, as the car goes slowly in reverse to park}} Save yourselves! It's too late for me!
:{{d|Darwin}}: Just get over on the sidewalk, dude.
:{{d|Gumball}}: Please remember me, guys, so I'll always be alive in your heart. {{d|event|cries}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Oh, for crying out loud...! {{d|event|honks}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: My whole life is flashing before my eyes! And it's boring! {{d|event|screams}}
::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson brakes and parks}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Huh?
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Darn kids.
::{{d|event|Gumball jumps on the windscreen}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|cheers up}} You saved my life, Mr. Robinson!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: I didn't save your life. I just didn't run you over! NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY!!
:{{d|Gumball}}: No way. I am not leaving your side until I've saved your life in return.
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Get off my car! {{d|event|turns on windscreen wiper}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|face being wiped}} I'll never...ever...leave...your...side!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|turns off windscreen wiper}} Don't make me shout at you. I gotta save my voice for tonight.
:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: {{d|event|grunts, opens the hood}}
::{{d|event|Gumball is launched to the space because of this}}

==The Debt==
:{{d|Gumball}}: Woo! {{d|event|gets in a praying position}} Oh, dear Universe above me, thank you for the gift of Mr. Robinson. I swear on my life, I ''will'' repay this debt. {{d|event|falls back to Earth}}
::{{d|event|The Moon and Saturn turn around}}
:{{d|Moon}}: What did he say?
:{{d|Saturn}}: I don't know. Whose turn is it, anyway?
:{{d|Moon}}: Hmm, mine. I spy with my lil' eye...

==At the Robinsons'==
::{{d|event|Gumball is at the door, lying like a dog}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|warms up his voice}} Well, Margaret, since you won't take care of my precious instrument, {{d|event|goes out the house}} I'll get the cough drops myself... {{d|event|stumbles over Gumball and falls}} What are you doing here?
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|gets up}} I'm here to save your life!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|gets dust off his clothes, whispering}} Not today of all days. {{d|event|in a normal tone}} Just get away from me, kid. I mean it!

==Hazardous Objects==
::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson walks along a corridor, there's a "Slippy Floor" sign}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|grabs a bottle}} Here they are. {{d|event|reads the label}} ''Antiseptic action...''
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|referring to the sign}} What's this hazardous object doing in the middle of the floor? {{d|event|takes the sign and carries it away}} Mr. Robinson can trip over it. There. Safely out of the way.
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|slips on a puddle right there where the sign stood}} Whah, no!
:{{d|Gumball}}: Ah! {{d|event|runs up to Mr. Robinson}} Mr. Robinson! He's out cold! Woo! {{d|event|cheers up}} Now's my chance to save him!
::{{d|event|Pantsbully stops Gumball}}
:{{d|Pantsbully}}: Step aside. I know CPR. {{d|event|proceeds to do it}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Uh? {{d|event|Pantsbully is about to do CPR}} No, no, no!
::{{d|event|Pantsbully does it twice while Mr. Robinson struggles to get away}}

==The Coffee Machine==
::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson approaches a coffee machine while coughing}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: I sure hope that hasn't affected my vocal cords. {{d|event|picks a coffee, warms his voice}} La, la, la {{d|event|coughs sharply to clean his throat}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|runs towards Mr. Robinson}} Mr. Robinson, you're choking! {{d|event|does him the Heimlich Maneuver}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Gumball! What the...?
::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson's heart falls out from his mouth}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|breathless}} That's my heart... {{d|event|falls, inhales sharply, grabs his heart with his tongue and swallows it, inhales alleviated and sits up}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|happily}} So, I saved your life, right?
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|angrily}} '''NO, you darn near ended it! Now leave me alone!'''

==At the Tan Salon==
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|sitting on a tanning machine}} Uah! A healthy glow will make me look my best for tonight. {{d|event|lies and closes the tanning machine}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh! Mr. Robinson! {{d|event|desperate}} Oh, no! I'm too late! Why wasn't I here to save you? Why?! {{d|event|bangs on the tanning machine, then falls on his face crying}} {{d|event|perks up}} No! NO! I refuse to let you go! {{d|event|opens the tanning machine}} He looks so peaceful... {{d|event|grabs a defibrillator}} CLEAR! {{d|event|zaps Mr. Robinson}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: What do you think you're doing?!
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|happily}} I'm bringing you back to life!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: But I ''was'' alive!
:{{d|Gumball}}: Better safe than sorry!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: NO!
::{{d|event|Gumball zaps Mr. Robinson with the defibrillator again, lights go out}}

==At the Robinsons'==
::{{d|event|Gumball is at the front door smiling, Mr. Robinson arrives}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Welcome home, Mr. Robinson! I booby-trapped your front door!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Why?
:{{d|Gumball}}: To protect you from intruders. All you have to do is ring the doorbell, like so...
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Wait, why would an intruder ring the—?
::{{d|event|Gumball rings, a big red ball crashes the front door and hits Mr. Robinson}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Ohh...
:{{d|Gumball}}: Are you okay?
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Listen, kid. This is the most important night of my life. I’m gonna shine... like a star! And I don't want you around to ruin it!
:{{d|Gumball}}: But I've gotta be there! To save your life!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Just leave me alone, kid. {{d|event|almost crying}} Just leave me alone!
::{{d|event|Gumball sadly goes and sits on the stairs}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|exhales}} I'll never repay my debt to Mr. Robinson... I failed you, Universe! {{d|event|cries}}
::{{d|event|Darwin and Anais lean out of the fence}}
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|with tears}} Poor Gumball...
:{{d|Darwin}}: What can we do to help him?
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|excited}} I got an idea!
::{{d|event|Darwin throws a brick at Gumball}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Ah! {{d|event|breaks in pain}}
:{{d|Anais}}: I said throw ''near'' him, not ''at'' him!
:{{d|Gumball}}: Ow! Oh, it's so painful. Oh man, that hurts. Ow, I'll try to walk it off! {{d|event|back cracks}} Ow! Bad idea! Ahh! Owww. {{d|event|falls on face, cries for a moment, perks up}} Oh! There's a note tied to it! {{d|event|opens the note}} Let's see... Mr. Robinson will be... {{d|event|misreads assassinated a few times}} ''assenominated... assisanattatted... assasina-ta-ta...''
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|behind the fence}} Assassinated!
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|realizes}} ...assassinated at the talent show! {{d|event|screaming}} This is terrible! {{d|event|normal}} No, wait... {{d|event|screaming again}} This is what I've been waiting for! {{d|event|knocks the door}} Mr. Robinson!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|goes out the door}} Well, Margaret, it's nice that you finally decided to show your support for me tonight.
:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: {{d|event|goes out, grunts}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: What do you mean you're only coming to see me fail? {{d|event|goes along with her}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Mr. Robinson! {{d|event|follows him}} You can't go to the talent show tonight! {{d|event|Mr. and Mrs. Robinson drive away}} YOU'RE GONNA BE ASSASSINA...! {{d|event|in a normal tone, with admiration}} He's so brave.

==The Talent Show==
:{{d|Senior Citizen}}: Take it away, Bert!
::{{d|event|The Senior Citizens are on stage, Marvin hurts his back finishing the performance}}
:{{d|Gary}}: {{d|event|tries to wake up Blue Elephant making a clap-like noise}} Wake up!
::{{d|event|The Senior Citizens leave the stage, the camera goes up a little: Darwin and Anais are on a platform at the top of the stage}}
:{{d|Anais}}: Okay, Darwin, here's the plan {{d|event|with a graphic explanation}} We drop heavy sand bags near Mr. Robinson. Gumball will notice and push him out of the way, just in time to save his life. {{d|event|finishes the explanation}} Got it?
:{{d|Darwin}}: Got it! We drop these heavy sand bags on to Mr. Robinson's head.
:{{d|Anais}}: No! We don't actually hit Mr. Robinson.
:{{d|Darwin}}: Hit Mr. Robinson. Okay, I understand.
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|to herself}} Maybe I should try reverse psychology. Okay, Darwin: the plan is we throw all this stuff at Mr. Robinson's head.
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|shrugs}} That's what I've just said.
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|facepalms}} Ugh! Just do what I do.
::{{d|event|Darwin facepalms too, Anais looks at him a little upset}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|goes down a rope, there is not enough rope to reach the floor}} Oh, man... {{d|event|drops himself}} Ow!
:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|comes to scene}} And now, ladies and gentlemen, would you, please, welcome to the stage our second and final act, Mr. Gaylord Robinson! {{d|event|leaves, (Gumball appears for a moment) then looms for a moment}} Good luck, Dad! {{d|event|leaves stage}}
::{{d|event|The curtain rises}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|clears his throat}} Up til' now, my life's been good. Treated me well, I can't complain. Met a woman, raised the kid and every day just felt the same. But there's something deep inside of me that always wanted to be free. And now I think the time is right... {{d|event|his voice gets higher}} to show you what I mean! {{d|event|takes off his clothes and starts singing I Wanna Be Free}}
::{{d|event|Mrs. Robinson leaves the seat displeased that her husband has not failed}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: What's he doing?
:{{d|Anais}}: I don't know, but it's pretty good. Now it's our chance to "assassinate" him! {{d|event|unties the sand bags}}
::{{d|event|The bags fall but Mr. Robinson evades them unaware of it with his dance}}
:{{d|Anais}}: Did Gumball see any of that?
::{{d|event|Gumball looks from side to side backwards the stage}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: Maybe, he'll notice the trapdoor.
::{{d|event|The trapdoor opens, Mr. Robinson evades it by jumping over as part of the choreography of his dance, Gumball looks out of it for a second and goes down, then it closes, Mr. Robinson's performance continues}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|appears between seats}} Show yourself, assassin, and fight like a man!
:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|with a remote in her hands}} Let's try the special effects!
:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|pushes every button on the remote}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Under the seats? {{d|event|looks beneath the seats}}
::{{d|event|The stage is full of flares, colour clouds, etc, making Mr. Robinson's performance even better}}
:{{d|Gary}}: {{d|event|amazed}} Whoa, who is this guy?
:{{d|Rocky}}: That's my dad! '''ROCK ON, DUDE!'''
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: I wanna be free... {{d|event|his voice goes higher, lights shatter, the building's glass shatters, the Robinsons' car window cracks, Mrs. Robinson is sent in a small driving frenzy, which ends with her crashing into a lightpole, breaking it, and having an air bag hit her face. One of the stage lamps starts falling right on Mr. Robinson's head, Gumball sees this and goes in a slow-mo way to save him}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|in slow motion}} NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
::{{d|event|The camera changes constantly between Mr. Robinson, Gumball and the lamp}}
::{{d|event|Gumball falls to the stage before reaching Mr. Robinson but the lamp remains suspended by its wire and stops falling}}
:{{d|Gumball}}: Mr. Robinson! {{d|event|the wire is unplugging slowly}} Please, come with me now. It's not safe here!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|in a normal tone}} No! Go away! {{d|event|continues singing}}
::{{d|event|The lamp finally unplugs but Gumball pushes Mr. Robinson away, saving him}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|realizes what's just happened}} Oh, my gosh! You really did... save my life. {{d|event|angrily}} '''BUT THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE YOU FOR RUINING MY PERFORMANCE!'''
::{{d|event|Everyone applauds Mr. Robinson}}
:{{d|Darwin}}: Hurray!
:{{d|Anais}}: Awesome, Mr. Robinson!
:{{d|Rocky}}: Way to go, dad! {{d|event|cheers him}} Bravo!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|pushes Gumball out of stage}} Thank you, everybody! Thank you! Thank you so much! I don't deserve all of this. {{d|event|the public continues cheering him}} Thank you! Thank you! I love you! And your love means so much to me...
:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|the lights in the background turns into the universe scene}} Thank you, infinite Universe for sending us our very own star: Mr. Robinson! {{d|event|activates a toggle unintentionally, shrugs}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Thank you, everybody!
::{{d|event|The platform where Darwin and Anais are standing starts going down, finally crushing Mr. Robinson}}
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: I love you! You put me where I'm today! Thank you so much...
:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh, no! I think we squished Mr. Robinson!
:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|tries to say something}}
:{{d|Anais}}: Nah, he's okay. Let's go home.
::{{d|event|Anais and Darwin leave happily and the episode ends}}
