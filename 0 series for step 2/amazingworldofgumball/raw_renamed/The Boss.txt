==Robinson's House==
::{{d|event|Episode starts with Mr. Robinson mowing the grass}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Ahhh... Perfect.

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: Meh-meh.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Hmm?

::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson notices the grass}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: It's just a little mistake, Margaret. Everyone makes mistakes. {{d|event|Whispers}} Our marriage is a permanent reminder of that.

::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson mows the grass again}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: There. Now it is ''truly'' perfect.

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: Meh-meh.

::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson notices the grass again}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|Grunts}} Now all the other grass is too long!

::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson pulls a blade of grass. Then the other grass shrinks, and Mr. Robinson gets angry and smashes the lawn mower in anger}}

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: Meh-meh.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: IT'S ''NOT'' MY FAULT, AND I'M ''NOT'' A BALD PURPLE THUMB SHAPED... {{d|event|Whispers to Mrs. Robinson}} Sorry, what does "meh-meh" mean again?

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: Meh-meh.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: I AM ''NOT'' A BALD PURPLE THUMB SHAPED MEATBAG WITH AN EGGPLANT NOSE, AND I ''REFUSE TO MOW THIS LAWN AGAIN!''

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin smash through the fence}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Joyfully}} ''We'll'' do it!

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: No, I'm having a nice relaxing morning with my wife, and I don't-Ah!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin mow the lawn energetically, with Darwin acting as the lawn mower}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispers to Darwin}} You got something in your teeth.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Spits out a gnome}}

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: Meh-meh.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|Noticing the grass again}} Huh?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry! I've got this.

::{{d|event|He pulls the blade of grass again, and everything in Mr. Robinson's garden, including the fence, collapses}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: WHY, YOU GOSH-DARNED PAIR OF LITTLE---

::{{d|event|Suddenly Mr. Robinson's stuffing pops out of his head}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: I think I need to lie down... on my face. {{d|event|Keels over}}

::{{d|event|Ambulance siren sounds. Cut to Mr. Robinson being taken into an ambulance}}

:{{d|Bandage Nurse}}: Madame, your husband's anger levels have caused him to lose a lot of stuffing. He's gonna need a transfusion. Does he have any direct family member we could ask?

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: {{d|event|Says nothing but mehs}}

:{{d|Bandage Nurse}}: Hm. Yep. Hm. Alright. Well, that made no sense. Does anyone here talk with words?

:{{d|Darwin}}: You could ask his son, Rocky. He's a janitor, at our school.

::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson wakes up on the stretcher}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: I want nothing from that loser! He's an embarrassment to the Robinson name! I'd rather get stuffing from a turkey! Aaaaghhh! {{d|event|Passes out again}}

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: {{d|event|Walks over to husband}} Meh...meh.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry, Mrs. Robinson. We'll get Rocky, and ''save'' your husband!

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: {{d|event|Steals Mr. Robinson's wallet}} Meh?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs then whispers}} Nice.

==At School==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin watch Rocky in the hallway}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What's the best way to break bad news to someone?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, I know! With a song! {{d|event|Dances and sings}} ''Hey Rocky, we got some awful news! Your dad is sick 'cause we made him blow a fuse! Yeah!'' You got a better idea?

:{{d|Darwin}}: No, I got a much better idea. We just need to sweeten the news a little bit.

::{{d|event|Cut to Gumball holding a brownie}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Ah! Brownie! Sweet! {{d|event|Eats the brownie but suddenly chokes on it and after collapsing spits out a message which says "YoUR DAD iS iLL"}}

==The Janitor's Closet==
:{{d|Rocky}}: Oh. Man, this is pretty hard to digest.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Too much butter?

:{{d|Rocky}}: I meant the news about my dad.

:{{d|Gumball}}: You have to go to the hospital, man. He needs you.

:{{d|Rocky}}: I don't know. I've always been such a disappointment to him.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Has he ever actually said that to you?

:{{d|Rocky}}: More times than I count on my hands. {{d|event|Counts on his puppet hands}} So at least five. He thinks I'm an immature deadbeat who never left school, refuses to get a decent job, and dresses like a Canadian.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Well, are you?

:{{d|Rocky}}: Totally.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, we've got some news for you. You're gonna man up, wear a suit and tie, and get an office job!

:{{d|Rocky}}: An ''office'' job?! {{d|event|Panics; Faints}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Eh. At least you get a brownie. {{d|event|Throws brownie into Rocky's gaping mouth}}

==At the Wattersons' Home==
::{{d|event|Gumball searches on the internet}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Office jobs…

::{{d|event|Internet instantly chimes in with "-work at chanax inc" all over the search results}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: All the options say "work at chanax."

:{{d|Rocky}}: Chanax?! They're the worst corporation on Earth! They pollute, they cut down the rain forests, their boss invented boy bands... They're pure evil!

:{{d|Gumball}}: They also invented cheese puffs.

:{{d|Rocky}}: Hmm. Necessary evil, I guess.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Chanax it is then!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Lets start with your resume. What do you do at work?

:{{d|Rocky}}: I work real hard! To do as little as possible...

:{{d|Gumball}}: Right. I'm gonna write that you're goal-oriented. {{d|event|Types}} Okay, what else?

:{{d|Rocky}}: To be honest, I just lie down a lot.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Types}} Lateral problem solver.

:{{d|Rocky}}: Ah! I can whistle with my butt! {{d|event|Whistles "Star-Spangled Banner" with butt}}

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin gape}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Types}} Has a valid driver's license.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Now we just need a photo of you in a sharp suit, and tie.

:{{d|Rocky}}: I don't have a suit.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Don't worry. We've got it covered. {{d|event|Takes out spray can}}

::{{d|event|Cuts to Darwin photographing Rocky in a suit with tie}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Perfect!

::{{d|event|It is revealed that the suit and tie are actually spray painted on Rocky's body}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Squirms}} I'm so uncomfortable in this monkey suit.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, it's sprayed on to your birthday suit.

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Grunts; Grabs his photo}}

::{{d|event|He walks away, revealing that his back is not sprayed on}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Is that gonna be a problem?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Nah. An office job is like a mullet: work at the front, party at the back!

==At Chanax Inc.==
::{{d|event|In the waiting room, Rocky shakes nervously}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, chill out! Here {{d|event|Hands radio to Rocky}} take this. I'll deal with the answers. All you'll have to do during the interview is move your mouth when you hear my voice.

::{{d|event|A clipboard man emerges from a door}}

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: Rockwell Robinson? We're ready for you now.

::{{d|event|Rocky gets up, and reaches the ceiling. He is wearing shoes with very high heels}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Are you sure about the shoes?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah, man! The height makes you look powerful.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Go make your dad proud!

::{{d|event|Rocky walks into the door with confidence, but hits the door frame}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Ow! {{d|event|Rubs head; Walks in}}

==The Interview==
:{{d|Paperball}}: {{d|event|Inspects papers}} Well, Mr. Robinson, your resume is three sentences long, and every letter is in a different color. Perhaps you might like to add something?

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Opens mouth}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|e|through radio}} I've got excellent communicating skills.

:{{d|Paperball}}: Clearly. Do you speak any other languages?

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Opens mouth}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|e|through radio}} Abrigato! Comunicazione skills! Excellente! Misiveremuch (?)

:{{d|Paperball}}: Now. I feel obliged to ask, how do you range your communication skills?

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Opens mouth}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|e|through radio}} …

::{{d|event|Outside, Gumball takes out the batteries of his radio. Darwin tries to open a pack of batteries}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude! The batteries are dead! Give me the new ones!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Bites battery pack}} I can't open- {{d|event|Teeth pop out}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Rocky, try to stall him!

::{{d|event|They try to tear the pack open. Then they hear Rocky whistling the same song earlier with his butt. Gumball facepalms repeatedly, until his hand goes through his face. Inside, Paperball stares for a while}}

:{{d|Paperball}}: Well, I think you'll fit right in!

:{{d|Rocky}}: Seriously?

:{{d|Paperball}}: Yes. You're just the kind of employee Mr. Chanax is looking for: young, fresh and gullible. Here's your contract.

::{{d|event|A goblin, dressed in a suit and tie, pops out of thin air and hands a contract and pen to Rocky}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Uh…it says here that I'm signing away my hopes, and dreams?

:{{d|Paperball}}: Oh, that's just paper. {{d|event|Laughs}}

:{{d|Goblin}}: {{d|event|Laughs}}

::{{d|event|They stop laughing, but the laughter is continued by an ominous voice in the building}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Who's that?

:{{d|Paperball}}: Ha ha! Just my stomach grumbling.

:{{d|Voice}}: '''''Sign it, you fool!'''''

::{{d|event|Rocky signs the contract anxiously}}

:{{d|Goblin}}: {{d|event|Holds out jar}} Breathe out.

:{{d|Rocky}}: What?

:{{d|Paperball}}: Ha ha! It's just a formality.

::{{d|event|Rocky breathes into the jar, and the goblin disappears. He appears again, grabs Rocky's contract, and disappears. He appears once more, and places an ID card on Rocky}}

:{{d|Paperball}}: Welcome to Chanax… Mr. Robinson.

==At Elmore Hospital==
::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson stirs from his sleep}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Uh…Doctor, I can't breathe…

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are on top of him}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Ah! What're ''you'' doing here?! Margaret, get them off of me! Margaret?

::{{d|event|In the beach, Margaret is dancing with some sailors}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Strokes Mr. Robinson's nose}} We came to say that Rocky can help you with your transfusion.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: I ''don't'' want to see that loser!

:{{d|Gumball}}: But he's got a serious job now with a suit, and tie. They even call him Mr. Robinson.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Really? How's he doing?

::{{d|event|At Chanax Incorporated, Rocky types frantically. His pupils are gone}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Overworked...underpaid...downtrodden...kinda soulless, actually.

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: Ah, my Rocky...finally became a man. {{d|event|Grunts; Strains}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Mr. Robinson! What's wrong?

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: I was trying to shed a tear of happiness, but I think my heart's too dry.

:{{d|Gumball}}: But the only problem is he's so busy now that he can't come right away.

:{{d|Darwin}}: But don't worry! We'll take care of you until he arrives. Day and night!

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|Strains}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: What's wrong?

::{{d|event|At this, Mr. Robinson is so shocked that his nose bursts open, and more stuffing pours out!}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ah! We need to call the doctor!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Which one is it?!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I don't know! Try them all!

::{{d|event|On a machine, Darwin presses all the buttons. The buttons all move Mr. Robinson's bed, tossing, flinging, and flipping him up}}

:{{d|Bandage Nurse}}: {{d|event|Rushes in}} What happened to this man?! He looks like an empty sausage! He needs a stuffing transfusion, ''stat''!

==Back At Chanax==
:{{d|Gumball}}: Rocky, quick! Your dad needs a "statting stanfusion, ''trat''"!

:{{d|Soulless Office Worker}}: Oh, he can't leave, he signed the contract. Mr. Chanax owns his spirit now.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on, man. It' just a job.

:{{d|Soulless Office Worker}}: {{d|event|Endlessly typing}} Kid, they kept me here forty-seven years straight. I missed my own wedding, my kids growing up, even my own retirement.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Rocky, we helped you find this job; now we're gonna help you lose it!

:{{d|Soulless Office Worker}}: Nah, you can't get fired; it's too much paperwork.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, this is what I think of your ''paperwork''!

::{{d|event|He tries to take Rocky's typewriter away, but it is stuck on the desk. Darwin pushes over a stack of papers}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Thanks. Come on Rocky! We're getting your spirit back!

::{{d|event|Back at the hospital, Mr. Robinson is struggling}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: {{d|event|Coughs; Weakly}} Rocky…

::{{d|event|At Chanax Incorporated, Gumball and Darwin run while pulling Rocky's soulless body through the building}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: How are we gonna get his spirit back?

:{{d|Gumball}}: We need to get to the boss' office, and get him out of his contract!

::{{d|event|They stop by a building map}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: All we have to do is to go through the accounting department, then the archive department, then the secretary's desk, then the...

::{{d|event|Voices from the cabinets around interrupt him}}

:{{d|Cabinet Voice}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} ''What about your Christmas bonus? What about your dental plan? What about a raise?''

:{{d|Rocky}}: Yeah...what ''about'' a raise?

:{{d|Darwin}}: We need to run! THIS PLACE IS EVIL!

::{{d|event|They run through the walls of cabinets that are closing in on them. They manage to reach the door before they were crushed}}

:{{d|Cabinet Voice}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} ''What about a promotion???''

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Echoing}} NO! {{d|event|Slams door shut}}

::{{d|event|They enter a room full of paperwork. Stacks of documents stretch up to the unseen ceiling}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Whoa…

:{{d|Gumball}}: Shh! One loud noise, and we'll ''all'' end up under an avalanche of paperwork.

::{{d|event|They walk through the paper. Rocky begins to sink into it}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Quietly}} Come on, man! We're nearly there.

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Mutters}} So warm, it's like it's just been xeroxed...! {{d|event|Sinks into paperwork}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Quietly}} Rocky, no! Darwin, help!

:{{d|Darwin}}: It's okay! I got his other hand.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wait, what? {{d|event|Pulls out Rocky}}

::{{d|event|Confused, Darwin pulls what he grabbed and sees the skeletal remains of an employee}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, don't!

::{{d|event|Darwin screams aloud, and the stacks of paper fall down. They retrieve Rocky, and run towards the next door. Just as they are buried, Gumball opens the door and they slide into the secretary's desk. Gumball and Darwin get up, and dust themselves off}}

:{{d|Secretary}}: Good afternoon! Do you have an appointment?

:{{d|Gumball}}: No. But we can wait.

:{{d|Secretary}}: Oh, I'm afraid that's gonna have to wait until after lunch. {{d|event|Monster voice}} ''MY'' LUNCH!

::{{d|event|The secretary reveals herself to be a monster}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: AH-A! Maybe we'll come back another day.

::{{d|event|She jumps on them anyway. But she misses, and crashes through the window, and out of the building. Gumball looks down at where she fell}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Inhales}} Feels like I should say something clever, but I got nothing.

::{{d|event|The scene cuts to them waiting in the elevator}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Look's like she found us a window.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}}

::{{d|event|They come out, and walk to Paperball at the boss' desk}}

:{{d|Paperball}}: You were the first people to ever make it to this office. Congratulations.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Where's Mr. Chanax?!

:{{d|Voice}}: {{d|event|Monster voice}} Let them see me!

:{{d|Paperball}}: Yes...master.

::{{d|event|He unfolds himself, and reveals a face inside of him which belongs to Mr. Chanax}}

:{{d|Mr. Chanax}}: ''I'' am Mr. Chanax! I believe this is what you came for? {{d|event|Takes out the jar from earlier; Removes the cap and inhales the air inside}} Mmm. That's right! I feed on the spirits of my employees. {{d|event|Gesturing to Rocky}} ''Kneel'' before your master!

::{{d|event|Rocky kneels}}

::{{d|event|Mr. Chanax laughs. He manipulates Rocky like a marionette}}

:{{d|Mr. Chanax}}: That's right! Dance, my little puppet. ''[Laughs]''

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Stops Rocky}} Enough! Let him go!

:{{d|Mr. Chanax}}: Oh, but I'm afraid no one can leave...not now you've discovered my secret! {{d|event|Gestures to Gumball and Darwin}}

::{{d|event|Nothing happens}}

:{{d|Mr. Chanax}}: Yah! {{d|event|Gestures to Gumball and Darwin some more; Still nothing happens}} What? Why isn't this working?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Because your power only works on people who signed a contract.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah. That means nothing to us, man.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Grabs contract}} This contract is just like you: ''it's only paper''!

:{{d|Mr. Chanax}}: Put that down! Or I'll...I'll drink his spirit! {{d|event|Grabs jar}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: That's not his spirit, man. It's just a jar full of old breath. {{d|event|Rips contract}}

:{{d|Mr. Chanax}}: ''Nooooo!'' {{d|event|Shrivels}}

::{{d|event|Mr. Chanax crumples once more into an unconscious newspaper employee. Paperball gasps a final time before collapsing. Then the soulless office workers stop working, and regain their souls}}

:{{d|Soulless Office Worker}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} I'm free! I'm finally free!

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Turns back to normal}} What happened?

:{{d|Darwin}}: No time to explain! We're going to the hospital!

::{{d|event|They get in the elevator. Then the goblin appears, and announces to the workers}}

:{{d|Goblin}}: Dear employees, after four-hundred years in the business, Mr. Chanax has decided to pursue new goals, and spend more time with his family. The shareholders have named ''me'' as his replacement. Thank you very much. {{d|event|Demonic voice}} NOW GET BACK TO WORK, SLAVES!

::{{d|event|The workers groan}}

==Back at the Hospital==
::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson groggily wakes up, and sees a Bandaid doctor}}

:{{d|Bandage Nurse}}: It's a brave boy you got there, Mr. Robinson. He gave a lot.

::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson looks at his side, and sees his son}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Weakly}} It was nothing.

::{{d|event|He lies down, revealing he is flat from having so much stuffing removed from him}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: You made your parents proud, son. Isn't that right, Margaret?

::{{d|event|Margaret runs by his side, dressed in a wedding dress. She hides it quickly as she smiles at her husband. At the door, a sailor dressed as a groom sadly walks away}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Dad, I love you. But I can't be like you. I'm sorry, but I'm going back to my old life. {{d|event|Rips off part of "suit"}} Ah! I forgot this was sprayed on...

::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson's heart rate speeds up, but he remains calm and happy}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: It's okay, son. I understand.

:{{d|Rocky}}: You do?

::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson's heart rate speeds up more}}

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: '''Yes.'''

:{{d|Gumball}}: Are you sure? 'Cause…

:{{d|Mr. Robinson}}: '''''Yes.''''' {{d|event|Twitches}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Are you really sure? Because it looks like you're about to...

::{{d|event|The heart monitor explodes, and the episode ends}}
