==Frantic Morning==
::{{d|event|At the start of the episode, Gumball is in bed when he is awoken by the ringing of an alarm clock on the nightstand. He reaches over to silence it, then shouts at a still sleeping Darwin}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Quick! We have to get dressed, eat breakfast, and get to school on time, or Mom's gonna kick our butts! Good thing I slept in my clothes!

::{{d|event|Gumball jumps out of bed to discover he is only wearing underpants and Darwin's shoes}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hey, those are my clothes!

:{{d|Gumball}}: No time to change! You put on mine!

::{{d|event|Gumball runs out of the bathroom and goes downstairs with a tube of toothpaste in his hand. Darwin exits the bedroom and waddles after him while dressed in Gumball's sweater and pants}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, wait up! I can't walk here!

::{{d|event|Darwin falls over and the two topple down the stairs, miraculously changing clothes when they reach the bottom}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Huh, that worked out better than I expected.

:{{d|Darwin}}: You're wasting time!

::{{d|event|In the kitchen, Darwin is holding butter, a toaster, and toothpaste, while Gumball hands him several slices of bread and cheese from the fridge}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: We have to go faster! Spread the toothpaste on the toast, put the cartoons on fast-forward and give me a milk shower.

::{{d|event|In the living room, Gumball and Darwin are eating toast with toothpaste and watching TV. Suddenly, the TV turns off, and the two notice that Richard and Anais are sitting right next to them in their sleepwear}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, it's Saturday...

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin celebrate by jumping up into the air as they imagine fireworks surrounding them, while Ode To Joy plays}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Squirts whipped cream into her mouth}} And it's Dad who's looking after us. {{d|event|Squirts some more whipped cream into her mouth}}

::{{d|event|Gumball jumps into Darwin's arms with a slow iris shot as they smile. Just before it closes, Anais squirts whipped cream into Gumball's mouth}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ahh... I was hoping you'd do that.

==Shopping With Dad==
::{{d|event|The Elmore shopping mall is shown. Anais and Darwin are walking together}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I love hanging out at the mall with Mr. Dad.

:{{d|Anais}}: I know, right? You stay in your pajamas, eat junk food all day, and get anything you ask for. It's like a really trashy Christmas.

::{{d|event|Richard is pushing the cart behind Anais and Darwin, while eating candy}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Interrupts Richard}} Hey Dad, can I have twenty bucks to get my eyebrow pierced?

:{{d|Richard}}: First, I need to ask you one question, young man. Are you ready for the responsibility of how awesomely cool this is going to make you?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Bows at one knee}} Yes, father. I am.

::{{d|event|Richard pulls out a dollar note, while the Wilsons are watching}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Then take this twenty, and may radness illuminate your path.

:{{d|Jackie}}​: Uh, are you seriously letting your child get one of his eyebrows pierced?!

:{{d|Richard}}: You're right, take forty. Do both, that's much cooler.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Thanks, Dad!

:{{d|Jackie}}​: Ugh, come on, Harold. Let's go.

::{{d|event|Jackie walks off and Harold subtly gives Richard a thumbs up}}

:{{d|Jackie}}​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Off-screen}} '''HAROLD!!!'''

::{{d|event|Harold runs away as Anais walks up to Richard}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Dad, can we get this tape?

:{{d|Richard}}: Why?

:{{d|Darwin}}: To fix stuff.

:{{d|Richard}}: But nothing's broken!

:{{d|Anais}}: Yeah, but Darwin also wants to get this hammer.

::{{d|event|Darwin pulls out a hammer}}

:{{d|Richard}}: I'm not buying you a hammer... until we've tested how much fun it's gonna be first!

::{{d|event|Cut to Anais and Darwin bashing food on two plates, which are being held by Karen. Richard is holding Anais}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Stops hammering}} Wait... aren't we gonna have to pay for all this?

:{{d|Richard}}: We don't have to, they're free samples.

:{{d|Anais}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Oh! {{d|event|They continue hammering}}

::{{d|event|Cut to Richard sliding around the mall with an empty shopping cart, while making loud sounds. Darwin is seated on the meat counter, while Anais gently hammers his knee, as if she is testing his knee-jerk reflex. Gumball walks up to them}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Where's your piercing?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|His face barely moves}} I got some anti-wrinkle injections instead.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Really? {{d|event|Scares Gumball who fails to change expression, then laughs}}

::{{d|event|Richard gets off the shopping cart, letting it run away and crash off-screen}}

:{{d|Richard}}: I'm bored now. Let's go home.

:{{d|Anais}}: But what about the groceries?

::{{d|event|Richard goes over to Alison and takes her shopping cart full of groceries}}

:{{d|Crocodile Woman}}: Hey! That's ''my'' shopping!

:{{d|Richard}}: Oh, I'm sorry. Did you pay for this?

:{{d|Crocodile Woman}}: Uhh... No.

:{{d|Richard}}: Then it's not yours, is it? {{d|event|Leaves with Alison's shopping cart}}

:{{d|Crocodile Woman}}: Eh—eh—eh—eh—oh.

::{{d|event|Richard and the kids prepare to ride on the cart. Anais is already in the cart, while Darwin and Gumball are at the sides}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Boop... boop... boop... boooop!

::{{d|event|They speed away on the cart through an aisle. Gumball and Darwin get onto the cart}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Whooooooo!

::{{d|event|The Wattersons continue their cart ride as they exit the elevator and speed through the parking space. The kids laugh. The cart crashes through the gate arm}}

:{{d|Guard 2}}: Hey! you can't do that!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Of course we can! Everything is allowed with my dad!

::{{d|event|The guard smiles}}

==Lunch==
::{{d|event|Gumball opens the fridge door}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: ''Boom!''

::{{d|event|He gathers the ingredients}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Singing}} ''We home alone with Dad, so I make me own lunch.''

:{{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: ''Ooh!''

:{{d|Gumball}}: ''I can eat what I want, so I pick the best munch.''

:{{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: ''Ooh!''

:{{d|Gumball}}: ''I pick up ham and chocolate chips and stick 'em in the bread.''

:{{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: ''Ooh!''

:{{d|Gumball}}: ''It need a little sauce, I say maple and red.''

:{{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: ''Boom!''

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, have you noticed that your voice has changed?

:{{d|Gumball}}: What, you mean how I sound like a man and you squeal like a piglet on helium?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Voice cracking}} You take that back!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Laughs}} Sure, when you ask me like a man.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Shrieking}} I ''am'' a man!!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Really? 'Cause right now you sound like a mouse whose parachute won't open.

::{{d|event|Anais laughs at this}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Rising in pitch}} If you don't take that back, I'm going to—

::{{d|event|Darwin shrieks at Gumball and his voice turns into high pitched ringing. Gumball and Anais' pupils shrink and roll behind their eyes}}

:{{d|Shooting Star}}: {{d|event|On TV; to Gary}} You have won this antique crystal decanter worth over ten-thous—

::{{d|event|Shooting Star explodes because of Darwin's screeching; Darwin continues screeching and his voice returns to normal}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Voice cracking}} —By the time I'm finished, you'll be whistling out your ''butt!''

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ugh! Okay, okay, I take it back. Man, my ears are still ringing.

::{{d|event|Doorbell rings}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ah! There it is again.

::{{d|event|Richard opens the door}}

:{{d|Harold}}​​​​​​​: {{d|event|British accent}} Lord Watterson, the word on the streets of Elmore is that yours is a house with no rules. I humbly request asylum in your palace of freedom.

:{{d|Richard}}: What?

:{{d|Harold}}​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Normal voice}} Everyone in Elmore is talking about how laid back you guys are. Can I hang out at your house? I'm not allowed to be myself at home. 

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|British accent}} I hereby grant thee thy fairest and most cherished wish. 

:{{d|Harold}}​​​​​​​: What?

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Normal voice}} That means yes.

==The House of Freedom==
:: {{d|event|Harold repeatedly pokes Gumball's face}}

: {{d|Gumball}}: I'm starting to see why your family won't let you be yourself.

: {{d|Harold}}​​​​: {{d|event|Poking Gumball's face}} I like touching things.

: {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Mixing his oatmeal}} To be honest, I'm more annoyed at the others.

::{{d|event|Camera pans out revealing Richard had allowed anyone to enter and trash their house. The librarian is speaking to Sal while he's looting antiques from a shelf}}

:{{d|Librarian}}: THIS HOUSE IS GREAT! NORMALLY I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SHOUT. I WORK IN THE LIBRARY, YOU SEE?

:{{d|Sal Left Thumb}}: Yeah, they don't judge here. Which is great, 'cause usually judges don't like me.

::{{d|event|Mrs. Jötunheim and Porky are talking while they are having a drink}}

: {{d|Mrs. Jötunheim}}: Ah, finally a place where I am not pressured by society to be beautiful.

: {{d|Porky}}​​: You don't look that different.

: {{d|Mrs. Jötunheim}}: I haven't taken off my makeup yet.

::{{d|event|Mrs. Jötunheim wipes her makeup off revealing her unpleasant appearance. Porky spits his drink back}}

: {{d|Mrs. Jötunheim}}: How about you?

: {{d|Porky}}​: {{d|event|Takes his buns off}} I just came here 'cause people don't like it when I'm naked.

: {{d|Mrs. Jötunheim}}: You know that was only covering your back, right?

:{{d|Porky}}​​​​​​​​: Yeah.

:: {{d|event|Mr. Small is ravenously eating meat in the kitchen}}

: {{d|Hank (construction man)}}: I thought you were some kinda vegetarian eco-warrior?

: {{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​: Only so I can get that rush of superiority for making other people feel guilty.

: {{d|Hobo}}: {{d|event|To Richard}} Hey dude, I hope you don't mind. I've invited a few friends to the party.

: {{d|Anais}}: Uh, before we open that door, please define a few.

: {{d|Hobo}}: Like, a bunch?

: {{d|Anais}}: And by that you mean?

: {{d|Hobo}}: You know, some?

: {{d|Anais}}: Gimme a ballpark figure.

: {{d|Hobo}}: S-several?

: {{d|Richard}}: I'm sure that's fine.

:: {{d|event|Richard opens the door and a large number of rats rush in, carrying Anais away}}

: {{d|Anais}}: Whaaah!

: {{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Walks in avoiding the rats}} We need to talk.

:: {{d|event|Richard, Gumball, Darwin, and Anais go to the front lawn}}

: {{d|Gumball}}: You're too nice, Dad. It was fun when it was just the three of us abusing how easy-going you are, but this has gone too far.

: {{d|Hank (construction man)}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Hey, go poke yourself!

:: {{d|event|Throws Harold out through the window}}

: {{d|Anais}}: Gumball is right. You need to show some authority and tell these people to go. 

::{{d|event|Harold repeatedly pokes Anais' face}} 

:{{d|Anais}}: We learned a lesson today: Freedom is a beautiful thing, but too much of it is... Hold on a second. 

::{{d|event|Anais loses patience and throws Harold back inside through the window}} 

:{{d|Anais}}: AND STOP POKING PEOP— {{d|event|Gags when Harold pokes the inside of her mouth}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: You need to learn how to be less cool. Practice on Gumball.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey, Dad, can I have a flare gun?

::{{d|event|Richard inhales deeply}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Remember, you have to say no.

:{{d|Richard}}: ''Nnnnuuu. Neeahh. NNNN—''

::{{d|event|Richard starts babbling and shaking his head uncontrollably, then collapses on the ground and passes out after a while}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I think we can safely say it's not in his nature to say no. 

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin, and Anais return inside. Harold returns and pokes Richard. Inside the house, Hobo walks by, dressed in Gumball's clothes}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey, those are my clothes!

:{{d|Hobo}}: Not anymore! {{d|event|Laughs}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Trying to interrupt the party}} EVERYBODY, STOP! I SAID STOP! STOP!

:{{d|Librarian}}: {{d|event|Shouting}} SHUT UP, THE KID HAS SOMETHING TO SAY!

::{{d|event|The guests stop making noise}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Thank you. Now, what I wanted to say is that—

:{{d|Librarian}}: PAY ATTENTION EVERYONE! THIS MIGHT BE IMPORTANT!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Clears his throat}} Uh, as I was saying—

:{{d|Librarian}}: LISTEN CLOSELY, HE'S ABOUT TO SPEAK!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} I just wanna s—

:{{d|Librarian}}: ANY MINUTE NOW!

:{{d|Gumball}}: DO YOU MIND?! Okay, I know it's—

:{{d|Librarian}}: SORRY!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Inhales}} I know it feels great to be allowed to do whatever you want. Until now I hated rules like all of you. Freedom is beautiful, but the problem is: with too much freedom—

:{{d|Librarian}}: THIS LITTLE TYRANT IS TRYING TO STEAL OUR FREEDOM!

::{{d|event|The four are thrown out from their house}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: You can't throw us out. This is ''OUR'' house!

:{{d|Everyone inside}}: Not anymore!

:{{d|Gumball}}: That's it, I'm calling the police. {{d|event|At a payphone}} Hi, police? Gumball Watterson calling. A bunch of people just stole our house and won't let us in.

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: {{d|event|Inside the Wattersons' house}} Sorry, I can't hear you. I'm at a party at the Wattersons' house. You should come, there's no rules here. {{d|event|Tases Jeff and he pops, laughs}}

::{{d|event|Gumball angrily hits the handset against the payphone with his face turned}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: It seems the police won't be of much help.

::{{d|event|They return home}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Come on Dad, go and get our house back!

:{{d|Richard}}: I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna run through that door. I am not a bunny. {{d|event|Charges at the door}} I am a cannonball! 

::{{d|event|Richard stops at the door and turns around}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Who am I kidding? That's a solid oak front door. It's like trying to break a tree with my face.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Half an hour of heavy breathing and pep talking for this? Just use me as a ram guys.

::{{d|event|Anais and Darwin are running to the door using Gumball as a ram}}

:{{d|Darwin}}, {{d|Anais}}, and {{d|Gumball}}: Aaaaaaaaaah!

::{{d|event|Gumball's face goes through the mail slot instead of breaking the door, and Harold pokes his eye. Next, Gumball tries to open the door with Richard's credit card}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Oh, this is all my fault. It's because I have no authority. If I wasn't such a lenient slacker, none of this would have happened. {{d|event|Sobs}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, that's true.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uh-huh.

:{{d|Anais}}: Yup.

:{{d|Richard}}: Oh come on, you're supposed to say, "No Dad, we're all responsible." Then we would hug, and I would feel less guilty.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mmm... Nah, this one's definitely on you.

::{{d|event|Richard's credit card is taken by Hobo inside}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: What the what?!

:{{d|Hobo}}: {{d|event|Singing holding the credit card}} ''Oh oh ohhh.'' 

:{{d|Rats}}: {{d|event|Singing}} ''Oh oh ohhh.'' 

:{{d|Hobo}}: {{d|event|On the phone}} Hello, sir. I would like to order two-thousand pizzas please.

:{{d|Richard}}: Hey, give that back! Aaah! {{d|event|Attempts to break the door the same as earlier and fails}} I just don't have it in me.

:{{d|Anais}}: Hold on, I think that guy gave me an idea.

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin and Anais are then shown disguised as a pizza delivery man}}

:{{d|Porky}}​​​​​​​​​​​: Yes, pizza! Thanks man, here's a tip.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Sticks his hand out from the coat}} Here's your receipt.

:{{d|Porky}}​​​​​​​​: Uhh, you can keep it.

::{{d|event|Porky attempts to carry the heavy stack of pizzas, but the strain causes his bottom to explode}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Please allow us— {{d|event|Gets punched from inside the uniform}} Ah! Me! Please let ''me'' help you with that.

::{{d|event|Gumball struggles to drag the pizza boxes in the house}}

:{{d|Porky}}​​​​​​​​: {{d|event|Opens a pizza box}} Wait a minute, how come this is so heavy? These boxes are empty.

::{{d|event|Richard suddently busts out of the pizza boxes}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Mouth full}} Surprise! {{d|event|Swallows}} In your sausage face! We're getting our house back, Trojan style!

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​​​​​: Come on, be cool man. Please let us hang out.

:{{d|Richard}}: Well, I suppose since you're asking nicely...

:{{d|Anais}}: Ahem!

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin, and Anais look angrily at Richard}}

:{{d|Richard}}: But I'll have to say... {{d|event|Struggles}} I'll have to say... {{d|event|Struggles}} I'll have to say... {{d|event|Struggles}} I'll have to say no! A man's house is his castle, and this is my house, my castle. So get out of here! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

:{{d|Harold}}​​​​​​​​​​​: Or what?

::{{d|event|Richard shrugs, and the four get thrown out again}}

==The Ruthless Ruler==
:{{d|Darwin}}: I don't understand, we did everything right.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, you turned responsible and showed some backbone. I don't get it.

:{{d|Anais}}: Hmm... something's missing, some kind of ruthless ruler.

:{{d|Richard}}: Yeah, a wrathful divinity that could crush this joyful chaos with one hit from its iron fist. Someone like...

::{{d|event|Nicole arrives home. She walks to the four and causes them to cry silently. She then opens the door, revealing her eyes to be glowing. Nicole snaps her fingers, creating a powerful shock wave that stuns the partiers}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Scary, deep voice}} '''You're going to clean this place until it looks better than when you arrived. Then you will leave, and never come back.
'''
:{{d|Harold}}​​​​​​​: Pfft, or what?

::{{d|event|Nicole grabs Harold and stares with a deathly apparition of souls in her eyes. Harold then submits into cleaning while crying silently, and the others quickly join him}}

::{{d|event|Episode ends}}
