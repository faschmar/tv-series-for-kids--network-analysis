==Troubles Begin==
::{{d|event|The episode starts with Gumball on the couch watching television in his underwear, while Nicole is folding laundry by the front door}}
:{{d|Nicole}}: Gumball, don't forget to take that DVD back today, or we'll get a fine.
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Scoffs}} Can't you do it? ''You're'' the one with the car.
:{{d|nicole}}: I wasn't the one who watched ''Alligators on a Train'' seventy-two times.
:{{d|gumball}}: Ah! But technically, ''you'' rented it with ''your'' money.
:{{d|nicole}}: The money ''I'' have to go and earn to feed you kids!
:{{d|gumball}}: The kids ''you'' decided to have.
::{{d|event|Nicole punches a hole in the door}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Yep! No problem, Mom, I'll take it back!
:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Carries laundry basket}} Oh, very kind of you, honey. And don't forget to put on some pants. Bye-bye.
::{{d|event|Gumball walks into the kitchen, where Darwin is cutting a pizza using a DVD}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Darwin, have you seen that DVD anywhere? I— Darwin! What are you doing?!
:{{d|darwin}}: I'm using the pizza cutter.
:{{d|gumball}}: That's not the pizza cutter! That's the DVD! Oh, gimme that! {{d|event|Grabs the DVD}} Aw, man, you really have to be careful with these things. {{d|event|Wipes the DVD with a sponge}} The slightest scratch, and they're ruined... forever!
:{{d|darwin}}: Uh, Gumball...
:{{d|gumball}}: Ap-ap-ap. I am fed up with your carelessness, Darwin. This disc utilizes laser technology. You have to treat it with respect.
:{{d|darwin}}: You're using the wrong side of the scrubby sponge.
::{{d|event|Gumball screams, accidentally throwing the DVD into the garbage disposal and grinding it up}}
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Crying}} No! Nooo! What are we gonna do?!
:{{d|darwin}}: Face the consequences of our actions and tell Mom?
:{{d|gumball}}: Don't be silly. I've got a much better idea.

==Cardboard Scene==
::{{d|event|In front of Laser Video, Gumball puts a cardboard replica of the disc into the DVD case}}
:{{d|gumball}}: There. You can make anything with cardboard, and no one will notice the difference.
:{{d|darwin}}: Really? It looks kind of obvious.
:{{d|gumball}}: Man, you say that, but I lost my trousers three weeks ago, and still, no one's noticed. {{d|event|Walks away awkwardly in cardboard pants}}
:{{d|darwin}}: Everyone's noticed that walk, though.
:{{d|gumball}}: Really?
:{{d|darwin}}: You look like you went to the bathroom in a spacesuit.

==Urgent Mail==
::{{d|event|At the Wattersons' house, Gumball is lying on the couch watching TV. Darwin runs in with an envelope}}
:{{d|darwin}}: Dude! It's a letter from Laser Video!
:{{d|gumball}}: Ah, so what? Put it with the others.
::{{d|event|A small pile of letters is shown beside the couch}}
:{{d|darwin}}: No, this one's red! It means urgent!
:{{d|gumball}}: Red envelope or red writing?
:{{d|darwin}}: Red writing on red envelope. It's really hard to read actually. {{d|event|Opens the envelope}} It says we have to pay twenty-five dollars for the DVD!
:{{d|gumball}}: Ah! What are we gonna do?!
:{{d|darwin}}: Face the consequences of our actions and tell Mom?
:{{d|gumball}}: No, no, no, no, no. Just give me a little time to think.

==On the Streets==
::{{d|event|Outside a convenience store, Gumball and Darwin are shown begging for money using an old hat}}
:{{d|darwin}}: It took you two days to think of this?
:{{d|gumball}}: Less complaining, more begging. How much have we got anyway?
:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Rifles through the change in their hat}} Like three dollars?
:{{d|gumball}}: Great. Twenty-two more, and we can pay for the DVD. Now pinch me. We get more when it looks like I'm crying.
::{{d|event|Darwin pinches his arm, causing him to tear up}}
:{{d|Hobo}}: The reason you guys are on the streets is to pay a DVD fine?
:{{d|gumball}}: Yeah, I know. It's crazy, right? People don't understand how hard our life is.
::{{d|event|The hobo reaches down, switching his empty hat with theirs}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Hey!
::{{d|event|When Gumball tries to take their money back, the hobo starts grunting. Every time his hand moves towards the hat, the hobo growls. Darwin starts to beatbox, and the hobo grunts along to the rhythm. Gary passes by and drops money into the boys' hat}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Yes!
:{{d|darwin}}: Yay!
::{{d|event|The hobo swipes the money and walks into the store}}
:{{d|gumball}}: But...
:{{d|darwin}}: That guy stole our cash!
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Well, Darwin, sometimes in life, you have to realize that there are less fortunate people than ourselves. He needs that money more than we do.
:{{d|Hobo}}: {{d|event|Exits the store}} Woo-hoo! I won! I spent your money on a scratch card, and now, I'm a millionaire!
:{{d|gumball}}: That's great! So, can we have our four dollars back?
:{{d|Hobo}}: Oh, uh, s-sorry, guys. I-I don't have any, any change. {{d|event|Walks away, the sound of numerous coins jingling in his coat, and has possibly lied; Gumball sighs}}

==Job Hunting==
::{{d|event|Back at the house, Darwin checks the answering machine}}
:{{d|Machine}}: You have eight new messages.
:{{d|larry}}: {{d|event|In message}} Hi, Laser Video here— {{d|event|Darwin skips the message}} Hello, it's Laser Video, we— {{d|event|Skip}} You need to bring back— {{d|event|Skip}} You need— {{d|event|Skip}} to bring— {{d|event|Skip}} the film— {{d|event|Skip}} back to the shop. {{d|event|Skip}} Ha, ha, I knew you were trying to skip my messages.
:{{d|darwin}}: Gumball, I think we need to get a job.
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Looking through the newspaper}} Hmm. Can you cook?
:{{d|darwin}}: No.
:{{d|gumball}}: Can you drive?
:{{d|darwin}}: No.
:{{d|gumball}}: Can you speak Chinese?
:{{d|darwin}}: 我真的不知道如何说中文，因为它真的很难说，我只知道一个小的中国说话，所以我不能说。
:(Translation) I don't really know how to speak Chinese because it is really hard to speak it and I only know a little Chinese, so I can't say I﻿ speak it.
::{{d|event|The subtitles say "No."}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Can you provide inspirational leadership to a core team of thirty people, covering both national or international markets?
:{{d|darwin}}: Mmm, no.
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Excited}} Wait, how about this one? "Looking for a person with no skills or training to serve as a scientific subject for the cosmetics industry."
:{{d|darwin}}: What does that mean?
:{{d|gumball}}: It means they'll put makeup on us and see if it looks nice.
:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Gasp}} Kind of like modeling?!
:{{d|gumball}}: Yeah.
:{{d|darwin}}: I've always thought I'd make a good model.
:{{d|gumball}}: What makes you think that?
:{{d|darwin}}: My cheekbones.
:{{d|gumball}}: There are bones in there?
::{{d|event|Gumball pushes his hand into Darwin's cheek}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Oh, huh. There are.

==On the Job (With a Makeup Mishap)==

::{{d|event|Cut to the cosmetics building, Gumball and Darwin answer questions from Martha}}
:{{d|Martha}}: Are you boys eighteen?
:{{d|gumball}}: Uh, does it count if I've been both eight and ten?
:{{d|Martha}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} I suppose so. Now step into the makeup booth.
:{{d|Voice}}: Please relax. Look into the red dot and pout.
::{{d|event|As the machine applies the makeup, Gumball screams and falls, while Darwin stands perfectly}}
:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Looks in the mirror}} Hey, that's not bad! Looking good. {{d|event|Screams}} What happened to you?!
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Swollen}} I think I'm allergic. {{d|event|Slurps}} How come you look so good?
:{{d|darwin}}: I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with my... perfect skin.
:{{d|gumball}}: I think I'm gonna get this off. {{d|event|Wipes his face with a cloth, causing both the makeup and his eye to smear}} What happened? Why am I looking at the floor?
:{{d|Martha}}: Okay, boys. So how did the tests go? {{d|event|Sees Gumball}} AAH—

==Mom Senses Tingling==
::{{d|event|Cuts back to the Wattersons' house}}
:{{d|gumball}}: I can't believe she only gave us five bucks. It cost more than that to get home on the bus. {{d|event|Struggles to open the door}} Huh? Oh, man! More letters from Laser Video! Oh, we are in so much trouble. We have to hide these before mom gets home.
::{{d|event|The phone suddenly rings, and Gumball goes to answer it}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Yes?
:{{d|nicole}}: Honey, are you in trouble? Because my mother senses are tingling. I can smell trouble.
::{{d|event|Gumball changes expressions}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Trouble? {{d|event|Chuckles nervously}} No, we're fine. Absolutely fine. No trouble here, bye.
:{{d|Nicole}}: Are you lying?
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Laughs}} Oh, no, of course not.
:{{d|Nicole}}: Right. You're lying. I'm coming home now.
:{{d|gumball}}: Mom's on her way home. Now.
:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} What should we do? Should we tell the truth and face the consequences of our actions?!
:{{d|gumball}}: What is it with you with and trying to be honest all the time? No! We need a copy of ''Alligators on a Train''. I know. I'm gonna download it.
:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} '''GUMBALL!''' You wouldn't steal a car! You wouldn't steal a woman's purse! You wouldn't steal a cell phone! '''PIRACY IS STEALING!'''
:{{d|gumball}}: I know. I'm... I'm so sorry.
:{{d|darwin}}: Anyway, I got a better idea.
:{{d|gumball}}: Is it stupid, desperate, and very unlikely to get us out of this mess?
:{{d|darwin}}: Yes.
:{{d|gumball}}: Is it humiliating?
:{{d|darwin}}: If we get it wrong.
:{{d|gumball}}: Are we likely to get it wrong?
:{{d|darwin}}: Possibly.
:{{d|gumball}}: In the time it's taking me to ask you these questions, could you have just told me what it is?
:{{d|darwin}}: Definitely.
:{{d|gumball}}: Should we get on with it then?
:{{d|darwin}}: Yeah, we better.

==Chase Scene==
::{{d|event|Cuts to the front of the house, where Nicole's car pulls up. Nicole walks towards the house, but stops after passing the mailbox, sniffing the air like a dog picking up a trail. The trail leads her to the mailbox, which dumps letters at her feet as she opens it. She picks one up and reads it}}
:{{d|nicole}}: I knew it. You are in so much trouble!
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are in their bedroom putting a DVD into the Laser Video case when they hear Nicole}}
:{{d|gumball}}: We need to get to Laser Video before Mom kicks our butt!
:{{d|Nicole}}: What did you do this time?!
::{{d|event|Gumball gasps}}
:{{d|nicole}}: Stop right there!
:{{d|gumball}}: Quick! {{d|event|Grunts}}
:{{d|nicole}}: Where do you think you're going?! Don't you dare run away from your mother!
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin run through a yard, knocking over an umbrella, a table, and a lawn recliner. Nicole vaults up the umbrella, leaps off it, grinds across the table edge on the grill cover, flips through the air, slides down the chair, and lands perfectly on her feet}}
:{{d|gumball}} and {{d|darwin}}: Whoa!
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin run through the Fitzgeralds' backyard, crossing the pool by jumping on Patrick and his inflatable raft. Nicole crosses by jumping off Judith's head. Gumball and Darwin then land on a trampoline in another yard, with Nicole coming right down at them}}
:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Aah!
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin bounce away, taking the trampoline with them. Nicole faceplants into the dirt}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Mom, are you okay?
:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Muffled}} You're in so much trouble.
:{{d|gumball}}: What was that?
:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Lifts her head}} You're in so much trouble!
::{{d|event|The boys scream, then resume running. They jump over another fence, only to find themselves confronted by an angry dog on a leash. They edge around the fence, but Gumball notices the stake holding the dog's rope coming loose}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Quick!
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin escape through a loose plank on the other side of the fence, as the pursuing dog smacks into it, and keeps barking. Nicole enters the yard from the other side, and the dog turns its attention to her. The boys stop running when they hear Nicole scream}}
:{{d|darwin}}: Gumball, we have to help Mom!
:{{d|gumball}}: I don't know. I mean, m-maybe she'll be all right? {{d|event|Chuckles nervously}}
:{{d|darwin}}: Gumball! There's a monstrous creature attacking our mother! We need to face the consequences of our actions and help her out!
:{{d|gumball}}: Yes. I'm— I'm sorry. You're right. {{d|event|Suddenly the barking stops}} Wait a minute. Why has it gone quiet?
::{{d|event|After a long pause, Nicole bursts through the fence, riding the dog}}
:{{d|gumball}} and {{d|darwin}}: Aa-a-ah!
::{{d|event|They crash through several fences}}
:{{d|nicole}}: Stop right now!
:{{d|gumball}}: Aah!
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin stop, separating just as Nicole and the dog rocket between them, leaving a long line of fence holes in their wake until they collide with a brick wall. Gumball and Darwin look at each other for a moment, then run off}}

==Sometimes You Just Have to Run ==

::{{d|event|Scene cuts to Laser Video. Gumball and Darwin race inside}}
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Panting}} Stop the letters! Stop the letters!
:{{d|larry}}: Ah... the Wattersons. It's about time you showed up. I assume you have my money?
:{{d|gumball}}: Better than that, Larry. We got the DVD.
:{{d|larry}}: I hope you don't mind if I make sure it's real. Last time, it was a piece of cardboard.
:{{d|gumball}}: Heh, go for it.
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin wink at each other. Larry loads the DVD into a DVD player. The screen cuts through to a homemade version of the movie. Darwin's hands are seen holding a cardboard sign with "Alligators on a Train" written in crayon}}
:{{d|gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: ''Alligators on a Train''.
::{{d|event|The movie cuts to Darwin, wearing a fake mustache, standing in front of a cardboard alligator and a cardboard train backdrop. The backyard fence is visible through the train windows}}
:{{d|darwin}}: Oh, no! There's alligators on this train! {{d|event|Darwin is shown fighting the "alligator" for a while. The alligator, however, is still in the background}}
:{{d|darwin}}: Thank goodness we got all the alligators off this train.
::{{d|event|The scene then changes to the backyard, where the sun is setting. Gumball and Darwin are standing with their backs to the camera, their arms hugging themselves}}
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Feminine voice}} Thank you so much for saving us from all the alligators on this train. {{d|event|Kissing noises}}
::{{d|event|The movie then shows a list of credits, almost all of which are credited to either Gumball, Darwin, or "cardboard"}}
:{{d|gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Doo-doo-doo. Alligators off this train. {{d|event|Humming}} Alligators off this train. {{d|event|Humming}} Alligators on a train!
::{{d|event|The film ends}}
:{{d|larry}}: This had better be a joke.
:{{d|gumball}}: Aw, man, what gave it away?
:{{d|larry}}: Dude, it's five seconds long, and every name in the credits is one of you two.
:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} I told you we should have put some other people on the credits.
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} What? And let them have all the glory?
:{{d|larry}}: Well, there's no way I can accept this. You need to give me the real DVD now!
:{{d|gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Sobbing}} We can't! We used it to cut a pizza, and then we scratched it with the wrong side of the scrubby sponge, and then we threw it in the waste disposal! Please don't tell our mom!
:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Standing right behind them}} I already know.
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin scream}}
:{{d|nicole}}: How much is the DVD, Larry?
:{{d|larry}}: Twenty-five dollars.
:{{d|nicole}}: What? You made me leave work and chase you through the neighborhood on a dog for twenty-five dollars?
:{{d|gumball}}: But... But we were scared to tell you.
:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, silly... There's nothing you can do that will ever stop me loving you. Come here. {{d|event|Hugs her sons}} Now, let me pay for that.
:{{d|gumball}}: See, Darwin, you should ''always'' tell the truth and face the consequences of your actions.
::{{d|event|Darwin looks surprised, then punches Gumball in the arm}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Ow!
:{{d|nicole}}: Come on. Let's go home, you little troublemakers.
:{{d|larry}}: Uh, just a minute. There's also the lateness fee.
:{{d|nicole}}: Oh, yes, of course. How much is it, please?
:{{d|larry}}: Let me see. {{d|event|Calculating}} Three months and three days late. That will be seven-hundred dollars.
::{{d|event|Nicole's eyes widen in surprise}}
:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Chuckles}} You see, boys, sometimes in life, you really have to face the consequences of your actions. And sometimes you just... {{d|e|Suddenly grabs Gumball's hand}} '''RUN'''!
:{{d|larry}}: Hey, hey, '''HEY'''!
::{{d|event|The episode ends with a freeze-frame of Nicole, Gumball, and Darwin running away from Larry}}
