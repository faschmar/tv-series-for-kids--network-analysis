==Gumball's Bad Mood==

::{{D|event|The episode begins with everyone banging on Gumball's door and yelling for him}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Gumball, you promised!

:{{d|Richard}}: Mom wants me to vacuum the house, but I was planning to ask you instead!

:{{d|Nicole}}: No, he promised to come to the mall with me so I could try makeup on him, to see how it looks on me!

:{{d|Anais}}: But he said he would teach me the Finger-Touch-Heart-Disintegrating-Move so I can use it on that kid who pushed me off the seesaw!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hey! I asked first, and he said we would practice wheelbarrow racing for the county fair!

::{{D|event|Everyone starts banging on the door again and yelling for Gumball, then suddenly Gumball yells}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: NO!

::{{D|event|Everyone walks in the room, and Gumball is in bed}}

:{{D|Darwin}}: But why?

::{{D|event|Gumball turns his face to everyone, showing a grouchy face}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Because I'm in a bad mood.

:{{d|Nicole}}: About what?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's because you just- um...

::{{D|event|Starts to mumble}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} He's in such a bad mood, he can't even finish his sarcastic comeback!

:{{d|event|Everyone "awws" and starts petting him, and Gumball growls}}

:{{d|Richard}}: You know what I do when I'm feeling down? I pretend to be happy till I find that I am.

:{{d|Nicole}}: I thought you just ate chili dogs.

:{{d|Richard}}: The chili dog is a crucial stage, but the point is, you need to get up and get back into the swing of things.

::{{D|event|Still petting Gumball, his face sinks in. Suddenly, he explodes}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I DON'T CARE! Darn it, why can't you just GO AWAY AND LEAVE ME IN PEACE?!

::{{D|event|Warp sound, Gumball opens his eyes}}

== His Family's Disappearance ==

:{{D|Gumball}}: Uh... guys?

::{{D|event|Gumball enters the living room with the mattress on his back, looking around}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: If you're all hiding so I'd get up, I would like to point out that technically I haven't left my bed, so you don't win! Fine! {{d|event|Throws his mattress off his back}} If everyone is really gone, then no one would mind if I did this.

::{{D|event|Gumball has a weird looking face and knocks over a lamp, the lamp hits the TV, that knocks over and hits a shelf, stuff on the top of the shelf like a vase, falls and then a vase bounces back up and hits the shelf back to where it was, the shelf knocks the TV back where it was, then the TV hits the lamp then hits Gumball, and then he falls}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Looks around, rubbing his cheek}} Aaaaaa- it hurts, {{d|event|Making weird movements}} Ahhhh- I think I fractured my nose and sprained an ear or something. Aa! I think I need very expensive medical help, unless someone gave me a magic kiss? {{d|event|Thinks and extends his mouth to his cheek, giving himself a kiss}} What is going on here? {{d|event|Gasp}} I made a terrible wish {{d|event|Starts to tear up}} and now my whole family have disappeared! {{d|event|Grouchy face}} Good.

== Gumborg, the Creator ==
::{{d|event|Cut to the inside of a LEGO building in Gumball's living room. A few figures are inside}}

:{{D|Mr. Pumpernickle}}: {{d|event|Gumball's voice}} Morning, Mrs. Pumpernickle. What a beautiful day!

:{{D|Mrs. Pumpernickle}}: {{d|event|Gumball's voice}} Yes, that's why we live in Brickopolis, where nothing ever goes wrong.

:{{D|Mr. Pumpernickle}}: {{d|event|Gumball's voice}} Hark, it looks like Little Jimmy wants to tell us something.

:{{D|Little Jimmy}}: {{d|event|Gumball's voice}} AAAAAAAH! {{d|event|Little Jimmy is now screaming, as are his parents. Cuts to Gumball, towering over Brickopolis}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|With his grouchy face says in a deep voice}} '''I am Gumborg, your creator.'''

:{{D|Brickopolis Citizen}}: {{d|event|Gumball's voice}} Yay! Gumborg has come back to spread love and guidance!

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Still in his grouchy face}} '''WRONG!'''

:{{D|Brickopolis Citizens}}: {{d|event|Gumball's voice}} AAAAAAAH!

::{{D|event|Gumball starts stepping on the city while laughing evilly. He accidentally steps on Little Jimmy}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Normal voice}} Ow! {{d|event|Takes Little Jimmy off of his foot}} {{d|event|Gumborg voice}} '''Little Jimmy, I banish thee to the eternal swirling void of Lavatoria.'''

::{{D|event|Gumball throws Little Jimmy in the toilet and flushes it. Little Jimmy pops back up after a few seconds}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Hmm... {{d|event|Gumborg voice}} '''Gumborg the destroyer will be back - when the toilet tank is full.''' {{d|event|Normal voice, leaving the bathroom}} Being in a bad mood isn't as fun as I thought. I need something that will lift my spirits. Something that will nourish my mind and heart, filling them with joy, something that will prove to me that the world isn't such a bad place!

::{{d|event|The TV is shown. Gumball sighs, relaxed, and turns it on}}

== Terrible World ==

:{{d|Newscaster}}: Approximately forty-six percent of the lakes in America are too polluted for fish, aquatic life, or swimming. {{d|event|Gumball looks shocked}} And that number is expected to rise in the coming minutes. And now for the weather.

:{{d|Weather Reporter}}: Well, today will be great! {{d|event|Gumball looks happy}} If you don't mind extreme acid rain and high smog levels. {{d|event|Gumball looks shocked again, then calm. He changes the channel}}

:{{D|Another TV Man}}: And here we have a family of rare golden toads, {{d|event|Gumball smiles}} the only three of their kind left on the entire planet--{{d|event|An eagle is heard screeching on TV and Gumball looks scared}} The only two of their kind left on the entire planet--{{d|event|A bear is heard roaring and Gumball looks angry}} Yep, the only one of its kind left on the entire planet. {{d|event|A chainsaw is heard and Gumball looks very angry}} ...and now for a commercial break.

:{{D|TV Woman}}: Are you unhappy with the way you look? You should be. With our shampoo, you can desperately try to obtain unreachable standards of digitally altered beauty. {{d|event|Laughs}}

::{{d|event|Gumball screams and throws the remote at the TV, breaking the screen}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|In his grouchy face}} What the what?! This is the first time the TV hasn't given me the answers! {{d|event|In his normal face}} Or at least distracted me from the question. There has to be something around that can cheer me up! {{d|event|Gasps and claps}} I know, music! I will use the power of music.

== Life Can Make You Smile ==
:{{D|Gumball}}: ''Look at me as I'm standing here,<br />I've got happy on my face, I've got nothing to fear!<br />I've got my legs, eyes, ears, my teeth and gums<br />I've got six working fingers and opposable thumbs.''

:''(Life can make you smile!)<br />Well, look around and you'll see it everywhere, I said<br />(Life can make you smile!)<br />So I carry on smiling cause I haven't got a care!''

:''A power-shower can lift you from a rut,<br />Although the shower curtain keeps on sticking to my butt...<br />I'm loving orange juice, so I fill it to the brim,<br />But after cleaningy teeth, the taste is pretty grim.''

:''I love the scent of flowers, but so do all the bees!<br />And the pollen, AHCHOO! brings out my allergies<br />And video games, they stop me from feeling glum<br />Although after an hour, they start to hurt my thumbs.''

:''(Life can be a trial!)<br />Look around you and you'll see it everywhere<br />(Life can be a trial!)<br />But I'll try to get through it and pretend that I don't care.''

:''But this game's too hard, I got stuck on level eight<br />That ain't the only thing about it that I hate!<br />I've got the sun on the screen and the 'net's too slow,<br />And the ice has diluted down my soda, don't you know?<br />There's the dripping faucet and the creaking door<br />Man, I'm so exhausted, I can't take it anymore!''

:''(Why is life so vile?!)<br />Look around you, it's out to bring you down, I said<br />(Why is life so vile?!)<br />And even this song has become annoying now!''

::{{D|event|Gumball falls on the floor, then sliding on his face, goes into the kitchen}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Uggh. Maybe food will fill the gap in my soul.

== Loaf-Loaf ==
::{{D|event|Gumball throws down a book and flips the pages and stops on a page}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Happy recipes. Meatloaf for a family of five, that's comfort food, right? Okay, first chop the onions, but be careful. {{d|event|makes a sensual face}} Onions can make you cry. {{d|event|Laughs}} UNLESS YOU MAKE THEM CRY FIRST!

::{{D|event|Gumball hits the onion and then it hits him in the face and he falls. He gets up}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Next, you'll need some meat and bread crumbs. I don't have any meat so I guess I will just double up on the old bread crumbs. {{d|event|Hits the loaf of bread, and puts the crumbs pile in the tray}} It could be a loaf-loaf. Next, one egg. And finally some fresh mint. {{d|event|Squirts toothpaste. He puts in the oven}} What a breeze, couldn't be easier, just put it in the oven for an hour and your family will love it. {{d|event|Bummed}} Oh, yeah, they're gone. {{d|event|Gumball's face turns grouchy again}} Ah, well, who needs them anyway?!

== Dinner Table ==
::{{D|event|Gumball sits at the dinner table with five plates full of loaf-loaf}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: So how do you guys like my loaf loaf?

::{{D|event|Gumball switches to another seat, acting like Nicole}}

:{{D|Gumball}}/{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, it's nice, it's like all the flavors collide and explode in your mouth giving it a distinctive.... burnt tire taste.

::{{D|event|Gumball switches to another seat acting like Darwin}}

:{{D|Gumball}}/{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, I love what you did with the onions {{d|event|Burps}} and it was great to taste them again.

::{{D|event|Gumball switches to another seat acting like Anais}}

:{{D|Gumball}}/{{d|Anais}}: I would say we were going to get food poisoning, {{d|event|nods dissaprovingly}} but there is no way this counts as food.

::{{D|event|Gumball switches to another seat acting like Richard}}

:{{D|Gumball}}/{{d|Richard}}: Yeah, it's disgusting, but you see food is just like... food, even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.

:{{D|Gumball}}/{{d|Nicole}}: So, Gumball, how was your day?

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|With grouchy face}} Everything was just peachy. I'm doing fine despite all of you ditching me. In case you didn't notice, that was sarcasm.

:{{D|Gumball}}/{{d|Richard}}: Nice. Seriously, though, is there anymore loaf-loaf?

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} What's the point of being in a bad mood when no one's around to notice? {{d|event|Grouchy face, close up}} Urgggh!

== The World's Disappearance ==
::{{D|event|Outside, Gumball starts angrily walking down the sidewalk with his eyes closed, shoving "people" out of his way, despite no one being there}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Grunts}} Everyone get out of my way! I'm in a bad mood! {{d|event|Stops in the middle of an intersection and opens his eyes - he sees no one}} Hey! Is anyone there? {{d|event|His voice echoes as shots of the city hall, the shopping mall, and the outskirts of town are shown; back to Gumball}} Guys? {{d|event|Walking near the hospital}} Penny? {{d|event|Walking in the mall parking lot}} Mr. Robinson? {{d|event|Walking in a park}} Principal Brown? {{d|event|Walking in front of a business}} Alan? {{d|event|Stops walking}} Actually, Alan, if you heard that, never mind, I'd rather it's just me left in the world, than just me and you. {{d|event|Resumes walking}}

::{{d|event|Dissolve to Gumball walking in front of an empty parking lot; he stops}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Okay. There must be an explanation for all of this. THINK! {{d|event|His body starts up like an engine, giving off smoke, then stops}} Okay. The whole town has planned an elaborate party and they're about to jump out and surprise meee NOW! Surprise! Wait, that's what ''they're'' supposed to say. NOW. {{d|event|Points in all different directions, anticipating someone}} No? All right then. Then it must be the end of the world and everyone went to a better place apart from me, but it's okay because all I have to do is apologize and I get to go, too. {{d|event|kneels remorsefuly}} SORRY! Nah, that would be too easy. Then it can only be because I wished everyone to go away. {{d|event|Drops down on the ground, defeated. Gets back up}}

:{{D|Gumball's Bad Mood}}: NEH. NO ONE CARES ANYWAY. I DON'T NEED ANYONE.

:{{D|Gumball}}: Wait, what am I saying?

:{{D|Gumball's Bad Mood}}: STUPID TOWN. I HATE LIVING HERE.

:{{D|Gumball}}: What the— What am I talking about?

:{{D|Gumball's Bad Mood}}: I HATE PUPPIES, CUPCAKES, AND RAINBOWS, TOO!

:{{D|Gumball}}: What, that's not true. I love rainbows. What's going on? {{d|event|A "Misery Burger" sign is shown}} Why is Joyful Burger now called Misery Burger?! {{d|event|A billboard advertising "Captain Crud" is shown}} "Captain Crud"?! {{d|event|Gasps at a newspaper on the ground}} The economy is ruined?! {{d|event|Nonchalant}} Wait, that's not much of a surprise-- {{d|event|Gasps and points at something}} WHAT THE WHAT IS THAT?!

::{{D|event|A gigantic black mass that's consuming everything heads toward Gumball}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: The darkness, it's calling me. I feel like I should run, but my legs won't.

::{{D|event|Gumball's legs start running}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Oh, what do you know? Good job, legs. {{d|event|Gasps}} FASTER, LEGS! {{d|event|Slaps his legs}} FASTER, FASTER, FASTER, FASTER! {{d|event|Reaches a crosswalk. He looks back at the mass and gasps. He rapidly presses the "walk" button}} Comeoncomeoncomeoncomeon! {{d|event|The "No Walk" sign turns to "No Escape"}} "No escape"?! {{d|event|Screams}}

::{{D|event|The black mass continues to approach Gumball, who is running. He begins to jump over a fence, then stops}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Hold on, I'm not scared of the dark, {{d|event|He's in someone's yard}} why should I be afraid of you?! {{d|event|The black mass pulls on Gumball's face. He pulls it off of him}} Oh yeah. That's why. {{d|event|Screams again}}

::{{D|event|Gumball jumps over the fence and runs through his backdoor, into the kitchen, and into the living room. He stops on the couch and the darkness alters the pictures on the walls}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: The paintings, they're changing! {{d|event|The darkness goes over a clown painting, but the latter doesn't change}} Actually, to be honest, that clown was always scary. {{d|event|The darkness now covers everything and Gumball can't see anything anymore}} What is this? {{d|event|Hops off what would be the sofa}} What's going on? Oh, what do I do? {{d|event|Paces back and forth}} What do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I-- {{d|event|Bumps into something}} What's this? {{d|event|Feels it}} It's our sofa. So maybe the darkness is all in my head, but how do I get out of it? Oh, what was it Dad said? Oh, that's it. "When you're feeling down, you need to try and get back into the swing of things."

::{{d|event|Hallucination of Richard appears}}

:{{D|Richard}}: When you're feeling down, you need to try and get back into the swing of things!

:{{D|Gumball}}: Yeah, Dad, that's what I just said.

:{{D|Richard}}: Oh.

::{{d|event|Richard disappears}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: No, no, wait, ''how'' though?! {{d|event|Groans}} I guess I just act like everyone's still here.

::{{d|event|The hallucination of Richard returns}}

:{{D|Richard}}: Just act like everyone-- Never mind.

::{{d|event|Richard disappears again}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Hey, but-- What were you guys asking me to do again? {{d|event|Gasps}} Oh, I think Darwin wanted me to practice the wheelbarrow. {{d|event|Attempts it a few times. He tries once more and someone holds up his legs off-screen. It's Darwin}}

== Snapping Out of It ==
:{{D|Darwin}}: There you go!

::{{d|event|The darkness vanishes, revealing the rest of Gumball's family and everything else}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Yes! {{d|event|Hugs Darwin}} I missed you guys. Oh, you won't believe what happened. I let my bad mood take over and before I knew it, this, like, darkness thing took over everything that was good, but fortunately I remembered Dad's words and managed to snap out of it. Phew, it's great to feel good again. {{d|event|He and Darwin wheelbarrow away}} I'm glad all that was just in my head!

:{{D|Anais}}: Should we tell him?

:{{D|Nicole}}: Ehhh...

::{{d|event|Flashback to Gumball trying to flush Little Jimmy down the toilet. Nicole watches from in the shower}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: {{d|event|In Gumborg voice}} '''Gumborg the destroyer will be back - when the toilet tank is full.''' {{d|event|Leaves the bathroom}}

:{{D|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Confused}} Uh...okay...

::{{d|event|Flashback to Gumball in front of the business. Alan is next to him}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Actually, Alan, if you heard that, never mind, I'd rather it's just me left in the world, than just me and you. {{d|event|Walks off}}

:{{D|Alan}}: {{d|event|Hurt}} Cold.

::{{d|event|Flashback to Gumball walking on the sidewalk and shoving "people." Timmy is playing in front of him}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Everyone get out of my way! I'm in a bad mood! {{d|event|Kicks Timmy away without noticing}}
:
:{{d|Timmy (Kindergartener)}}: Agh!

::{{d|event|Flashback to Gumball in the middle of the intersection. He has caused a traffic jam}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: Hey! Is anyone there?!

::{{d|event|Flashback to Gumball "fighting" the nonexistent black mass from getting his face in Banana Bob's yard, who is mowing the lawn and looking at Gumball in confusion}}

::{{d|event|Flashback to Gumball in the living room when he thought the black mass consumed everything in sight}}

:{{D|Gumball}}: What's this? {{d|event|Feels Richard's shirt. Everyone looks at him awkwardly as he does it}}

::{{d|event|Back to present}}

:{{D|Nicole}}: Nah. Let's save him the embarrassment.

::{{d|event|Episode ends}}
