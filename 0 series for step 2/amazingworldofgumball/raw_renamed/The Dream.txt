==Gumball's Dream==
::{{d|event|Gumball is seen walking down the school hallway. A giant Ocho, a melting Tobias, and a tiny Hector are also shown in the background}}

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​: {{d|event|On the phone}} Okay, bye then.

::{{d|event|Mr. Small puts down the receiver, along with his head, and starts moonwalking. Gumball opens his locker, then a flood of water comes out of it. When it stops, a pineapple comes out of it and gets caught in Gumball's hands. Richard suddenly appears; only he has become a centaur, and starts talking to Gumball in a garbled language with the only real words being "of" (possibly) and "America"}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: No problem, Mr. President! I'll have it on your desk by the year 2025!

::{{d|event|Richard salutes and slides off, leaving a rainbow-colored trail. Gumball turns to see Penny and the background changes to a space background. He dances towards her as she sings. Suddenly, Darwin appears next to Penny, who stops singing. Gumball is shocked and continues dancing nervously as Darwin dances with Penny and finally kisses her. The pineapple in his hands bursts}}

==Getting Mad at Darwin==
:{{d|Gumball}}: Noooooooo! {{d|event|Whimpers}}

::{{d|event|Darwin is shown next to Gumball in his bed, revealing that the whole thing was a bad dream of Gumball's}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Gumball! You're dreaming! Wake up! 

::{{d|event|Gumball gasps as he wakes up, and looks at Darwin angrily. He gets out of bed and starts "choking" Darwin by the legs due to him having no neck}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: What are you doing?!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm trying to throttle you but you don't have a neck!

::{{d|event|Darwin is confused by this. Cut to the kitchen. Gumball and Darwin have eggs and bacon on each plate. A glass of milk is right next to Darwin's plate, while salt is next to Gumball's. Darwin drinks his milk, while Gumball is pondering to himself}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm sorry dude, I don't know what came over me.

:{{d|Darwin}}: It's okay. It was just a nightmare. Will you pass the salt please?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Happily}} Sure, buddy!

::{{d|event|Gumball grabs the salt and turns the cap off. He angrily pours the whole salt container on Darwin's food while Darwin is confused. He then drops the container on Darwin's plate and pushes it to the side, crashing off-screen}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Angrily}} '''Dude!''' It was a ''dream!'' I didn't kiss Penny! It wasn't real!

::{{d|event|Gumball puts his hands over his face}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I know... but I just can't help hating you! You hurt my feelings!

:{{d|Darwin}}: You hurt your own feelings with your own brain! You're being irrational!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I know!

::{{d|event|Gumball stomps out of his chair and goes off-screen}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Crosses arms}} What are you doing?

::{{d|event|Cut to Gumball in the corner}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I stormed off in the wrong direction.

==The Apology==
::{{d|event|Cut to Elmore Junior High, where Gumball and Darwin are at the school lockers, the former not wanting to look at the latter}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I know you're upset, but... could you at least make eye contact with me? 

::{{d|event|Gumball ignores Darwin as his body twists around}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Okay, this is getting ridiculous.

:{{d|Gumball}}: I don't want to speak to you. There's nothing ridiculous about it.

::{{d|event|Gumball trips, untwists his body using his legs and got back up with an angry face}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Look, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but, I apologize. {{d|event|Quietly}} For something I didn't do.{{d|event|Normal}} Okay?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm sorry man, I j- I can't accept your apology. ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T MEAN IT!

::{{d|event|Time lapse. Darwin stands in front of the class}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I'd like to read a poem. {{d|event|Reads on the paper}} I am more sorry than there are grains of sand in the sea, accept my sincere a-po-lo-gy. When you are sad, it hurts me. So please forgive me, bud-dy. 

::{{d|event|Gumball closes his eyes and shakes his head}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Too cheesy?

::{{d|event|Time lapse. Gumball walks down the hall to his locker, and opens it, only to see Darwin}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Surprising voice}} I'M SORRY! 

::{{d|event|Gumball jumps, then slams his locker closed and walks away}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Muffled}} Too surprising?

::{{d|event|In the library, Gumball is on the computer. It dings and Darwin's video of a singing dog plays}}

:{{d|Dog}}: {{d|event|Singing, Darwin's voice}} Hey buddy, ruff ruff, I'm sorry, ruff ruff, if I treated you so rough, ruff. Please forgive me, ruff ruff, 'cause after all, ruff ruff, I am your BFF, ruff ruff!

::{{d|event|Gumball looks at Darwin angrily}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Too weird?

::{{d|event|In the Wattersons' house's backyard, Darwin has locked himself in a pillory while birds peck him. Gumball stands next to him, turning away, but returns to looking at him}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Aah, aah, ow, ow! I'm sorry, owwww! 

::{{d|event|Gumball closes his eyes and shakes his head}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Too medieval?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm trying, dude, but I just can't forgive you. You and Penny both betrayed me.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Penny didn't betray you. Nothing's changed. She would never pick me over you. Ask her.

:{{d|Gumball}}: I can't do that! She'll know I like her!

:{{d|Darwin}}: She knows you like her.

:{{d|Gumball}}: No. I mean, I ''like'' like her.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh yeah, you can't let her know you like like her like that, but you don't have to be that direct.

==Penny's Decision==
::{{d|event|In the school hallway, Gumball holds two cupcakes, one light blue and one orange}}

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Oh. So, I can have whichever one I want?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh-huh! So do you want this handsome, charismatic, faithful, devoted blueberry cupcake, or this backstabbing ugly orange cake {{d|event|Yells down the hall}} which should have never grown legs?!

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: What?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Cheerfully}} Nothing! Just choose which one you want.

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Well, I'd always go for the orange because—

:{{d|Gumball}}: Whoawhoawhoawhoawhoawhoa, wait. Consider this: If you'd previously expressed an interest in the blueberry cupcake, would you then {{d|event|Gets angry}} eat an orange cupcake behind its back before resolving a potential relationship with the blueberry cupcake?!

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Can I have a cake or not?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Cheerful again}} Sure. Pick the one you want.

::{{d|event|Penny begins to choose the orange one, but Gumball extends the blue and retracts the orange}}

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Look, if you want me to have the blue one so bad, why did you bring two?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uhh...

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Just give me the orange one. {{d|event|Takes the orange cupcake and smells it}} Mmm, smells delicious.

::{{d|event|Penny is about to eat her chosen cupcake when Darwin's evil face appears in the frosting and makes a kissy face}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Knocks Penny down and yanking the orange cupcake out of her mouth}} NO, THE BLUE ONE IS BETTER!

::{{d|event|Gumball tries to put the blueberry cupcake in Penny's mouth}}

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: {{d|event|Resisting}} NO, GUMBALL! I'M ALLERGIC TO—

::{{d|event|Gumball shoves the cupcake into Penny's mouth and she swells up. He jumps up and screams}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: What have I done?!

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: {{d|event|With a lisp}} The pills, in my locker.

::{{d|event|Gumball opens Penny's locker and takes out two bottles. One has blue and the other has orange}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh... which color?!

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: {{d|event|With a lisp}} The orange ones.

::{{d|event|Gumball groans in frustration and frowns. Time lapse. Gumball and Darwin are walking down the street}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: It's not ''my'' fault you gave her the wrong pills. She specifically said she needed the orange ones.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Breaks down sobbing}} Oh, how was I supposed to know the blue ones were thumbtacks?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: It's okay. She's fine now.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|"Strangling" Darwin}} This is all your fault!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, still no neck! 

::{{d|event|Gumball stops and groans}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Look, what am I supposed to do? You can kiss the person ''I'' love most in the world if it makes you feel better.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah? Who's that?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uh... probably you, I guess.

::{{d|event|Gumball takes off his own mouth and kisses his own face multiple times}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: How do you like that, huh?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Not as much as you do. You feel any better now?

::{{d|event|Gumball drops his mouth on the ground, bummed, and sighs}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Not really.

==Trying a Rational Solution==
::{{d|event|Cut to the living room. Gumball, Darwin and Anais are on the sofa}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Look, the best thing is if we just ignore it.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Agreed.

:{{d|Anais}}: To ignore ''what''?

:{{d|Gumball}}: The thing we don't wanna talk about.

:{{d|Anais}}: Pfft. Whatever. Wanna watch a DVD?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Perfect.

::{{d|event|Anais takes the remote and turns the TV on}}

:{{d|Man on DVD}}: When one man stole another man's girl, it was the ultimate betrayal.

::{{d|event|Gumball kicks the TV to the floor and it catches fire}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Uhhh, do you mind telling me what's going on here?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Gumball had a dream where I kissed Penny and now he hates me.

:{{d|Gumball}}: YOU DIDN'T JUST KISS HER, YOU STARED ME IN THE EYES WHILE YOU DID IT LIKE AN EVIL SULTAN!

:{{d|Anais}}: Okay. Look, all dreams are just subconscious representations of real-life thoughts. By analyzing what the dream means, we can resolve the real-life problem.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin make derpy faces}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Eh?

::{{d|event|Anais sighs}}

:{{d|Anais}}: If we work out what the dream represents, we can resolve the problem in real life.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin make another derpy face. Anais sighs again and makes a derpy face herself}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Explainy dream, feely good.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Ohhhhhh.

:{{d|Anais}}: Now, lie down and tell me what happens from the start.

::{{d|event|Time lapse. Gumball is lying on the sofa}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, I'm at school...

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Writes on her notepad and looks at Darwin}} Hm, classic anxiety dream. Probably represents a fear of not fitting in.

:{{d|Gumball}}: A-and at one point, Dad was there.

:{{d|Anais}}: Representing your fear of authority most likely.

:{{d|Gumball}}: And he became a centaur president.

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Confused}} All right... well, that could represent a fear of horses... in the White House?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, so Dad has a laser shooting out of his butt...

:{{d|Anais}}: Uh—

:{{d|Gumball}}: Then Mr. Small's head fell off...

:{{d|Anais}}: What?!

:{{d|Gumball}}: And then I found a pineapple in the locker, so I started dancing in the cosmos... AND THEN DARWIN KISSED HER! {{d|event|Sits up and smiles}} So what does ''that'' mean?

:{{d|Anais}}: Okay, uh, the pineapple is Penny, sweet on the inside, but hard for you to... handle, I guess. And... the butt laser, that must be, uh... because you need to chew your food more. {{d|event|Begins to sweat}} And, uh, the cosmos—

::{{d|event|Anais begins running her words together until she gets a brain cramp}}

:{{d|Anais' Brain}}: Brain craaamp!

::{{d|event|Anais then falls to the floor, lying down unconscious}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Well, that's what you get for trying to apply a rational solution to an irrational problem. We need to tackle this head-on.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Like how?

==Preventing the Kiss==
::{{d|event|In the Watterson children's room, Gumball and Darwin are wearing connected tinfoil hats and capes and holding glasses of milk}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh, is this gonna work?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah. The tinfoil reflects our brainwaves into each other's heads. So, when we go to sleep, we'll share our dreams! And we can stop me from kissing Penny, and everything will be fine.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, that, that makes irrational sense, but why are we wearing these capes?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uh, 'cause they're awesome. Now take my hand and drink your warm milk.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin drink their milk and then fall asleep on the floor. The two open their eyes, still on the floor}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, that didn't work.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Maybe we need more tinfoil.

::{{d|event|Everything suddenly goes black}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: All right, let's go to the kitchen to get some more. 

::{{d|event|A door from up high opens and Gumball and Darwin look in and down while warbly music plays}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh... looks like we need to jump.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin jump, but then they fly upward and scream. They hit the ceiling and the camera rotates to show that it is actually the floor}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Voice echoing}} Where are we?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Voice echoing}} This must be the space between our dreams. We need to find yours.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, which way do we go?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Pointing left}} This way.

::{{d|event|Beat. Grumbling is heard. Then Darwin points right. The duo start walking as the camera starts panning out}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Voice getting higher}} You know what? Maybe... maybe we should walk a little faster.

::{{d|event|They begin running}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Voice getting higher}} Yeah, maybe we should start running. 

::{{d|event|They continue running faster. Then they come out from under the sofa and are tiny. Darwin whispers}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: What dream is this?

::{{d|event|A normal-sized dream Gumball peeks from around the sofa at the now-tiny Gumball and Darwin, looking angry}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I think this was one of mine. {{d|event|Grows wings}} And we'd better start flying!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Grows wings}} Huh? 

::{{d|event|They take flight and normal-sized Gumball tries to swat them. They land on one of dining room's chairs}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING YOURSELF IN YOUR OWN DREAM!?

:{{d|Gumball}}: I squashed a fly once! 

::{{d|event|They almost get swatted and fly up to the light}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: And I never got over the guilt! 

::{{d|event|Normal-sized Gumball swats the light, but gets hit and knocked over by it}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: COME ON, LET'S GET OUT OF— {{d|event|They crash into the window's glass}} What the buzz?

:{{d|Darwin}}: There's some kind of invisible force field!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hold on, I got an idea.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin start banging themselves against the glass}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Why isn't this working!?

::{{d|event|Normal-sized Gumball pops up and uses black spray on the duo. They scream and the spray fills the screen. Gumball and Darwin hit a black wall and the camera rotates to show that they're on the floor between dreams again as they stood up}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I think I know where this is. This is the dream where I'm naked in public.

::{{d|event|A censor bar is over Darwin's bare feet}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, you're always naked.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh, yeah. It's probably why I dream about it so much.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|His clothes have suddenly disappeared}} Wait a minute, if this is your naked dream, does that mean that— {{d|event|Looks down, screams, and covers himself}} Well, at least we're not in public.

::{{d|event|It is revealed that Gumball and Darwin are in the mall and Pantsbully, Gary and Alison are pointing at them, and groaning}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Grabs the censor bar}} Dude, gimme that!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Grabs it back}} Hey, it's mine!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Grabs it again}} You don't need it, it's only your feet!

:{{d|Darwin}}: That's all I have left to hide!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wait, this is your dream, you can do whatever you want.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh, yeah.

::{{d|event|Darwin thinks hard and now he and Gumball are clothed and everyone else is naked. They both laugh at their karma}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, man. {{d|event|Darwin grabs a drink from a self-checkout}} Wearing clothes in a nudist mall has just the same level of embarrassment as going to a normal mall naked. Let's get out of here. 

::{{d|event|As they walk through the alarm system, it goes off. They're in between dreams again, but the alarm is still going}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Why do we still hear the alarm?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, it's the alarm clock! We're gonna wake up before we get to your dream!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry, I got this.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are shown sleeping on the floor. As the alarm clock goes off, Gumball reaches for the clock with his eyes closed. After knocking over the milk glass and a toy car, he turns it off. He opens his eyes in a new dream}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, where were you?! I've been in this car for, like, five days! I was so hungry, I was considering eating you!

::{{d|event|Gumball yelps and holds up his arm, which has a bite taken out of it}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Annoyed}} "Considering"? {{d|event|Normal}} Where are we? 

::{{d|event|They're in the family car, which is sinking underwater. The window cracks and Gumball panics}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh my gosh! We're underwater! I can't breathe! {{d|event|Hyperventilates}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Puts his hand over Gumball's mouth}} Then stop hyperventilating! You're using up all the oxygen, you air hog!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Panting}} Let's turn the air-con on.

::{{d|event|Gumball turns on the AC and it sprays water, filling the car. In the school hallway, Gumball's locker opens and the water pours out, along with Darwin and Gumball, who's holding the pineapple}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Coughing}} What? Huh? 

::{{d|event|Centaur Richard is stuck in lockers still using his rainbow butt laser}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispering to Darwin}} I think we're in the right dream.

::{{d|event|Darwin starts floating away from Gumball and the space background appears}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uhh, dude, what's going on? Help!

::{{d|event|Darwin screams as he is sucked in. Penny appears, singing}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Dances, angry}} Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Floating towards Penny}} I can't help it! Your dream is too strong! You have to believe I wouldn't betray you!

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's kinda hard when I'm watching you betray me right now!

:{{d|Darwin}}: It's your dream! Just think of a different ending! 

::{{d|event|Gumball thinks hard and a brick wall appears in front of Darwin, who busts through it}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|With a lisp}} Maybe something less painful?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hurry uuup! {{d|event|Grabs Penny in his arms}} THINK OF SOMETHING! 

::{{d|event|Gumball thinks hard again and Darwin's lips disappear, revealing his teeth and gums}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Can you think of something less horrific?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry, I just thought if you don't have lips, you can't kiss Penny!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Of course I can, it'll just be really hideous for her. {{d|event|His lips return}} Thiiink!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I got nothing!

:{{d|Darwin}}: I'm sorry— {{d|event|He puckers up and speaks unintelligibly}} You're making me do this! I'm sorryyy! {{d|event|Kisses Penny}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Noooooooooo!

::{{d|event|Gumball's pineapple bursts and he thinks hard once more. Darwin stops kissing Penny to look at her. He turns her to the camera to reveal that she has Sussie's face}}

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: {{d|event|Sussie's voice}} Haaaaaaaa—

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin wake up}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Aaaaaah!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Laughs}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Why did you make me kiss Sussie?! {{d|event|Starts wiping his tongue}} I can wash the kiss off my tongue, but it'll never leave my bra-hain!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Scoffs}} Get over it, dude. It's just a dream.

::{{d|event|Darwin gives him an angry look as the episode ends}}
