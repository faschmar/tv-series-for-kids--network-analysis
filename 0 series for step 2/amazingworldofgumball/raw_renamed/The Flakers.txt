==Classic Bully Chase==
::{{d|event|The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin running from Tina in the school hallway, then Gumball kicks a bucket filled with water}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Hey!

::{{d|event|Tina slips on the water}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ha! Ha! Ha!

::{{d|event|Gumball looks back and sees Tina skating on the water. Gumball and Darwin run to the library while Tina busts through the library door}}

:{{d|Librarian}}: Shhhhhh!

:{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin run to a dead end}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, no! {{d|event|Starts pulling books from the shelves}} Oh, come on, where are the secret passages when you need them? Ah!

:{{d|Tina}}: {{d|event|In Gumball's face}} Grrrrrr... take back what you said.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uhhh, I would... IF IT WASN'T TRUE! THERE'S NO POINT OF YOU TAKING PIANO LESSONS, YOU ONLY HAVE FOUR FINGERS, IT'S A WASTE OF YOUR DAD'S MONEY!

:{{d|Tina}}: And what do you suggest I play?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Pfft, {{d|event|Giggling}} maracas?

::{{d|event|Tina roars at Gumball}}

:{{d|Tina}}: You better have some kind of escape plan right now.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, better than that, I got a best friend who's always here to save my skin.

::{{d|event|Gumball looks over at Darwin, but he is nowhere to be seen}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Just do what you gotta do.

==Flaking Out on Me==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the TV where a game is being played, then the camera shows Darwin and Anais playing said video game in the Watterson living room; Gumball is frowning and has a neck brace on him;  Richard's eyes are dilated and is playing around with the phone}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Acts like he's showering and sings, then phone rings}} Sorry, I can't talk right now, I'm in the shower.

:{{d|Unknown Caller}}: What? 

::{{d|event|The caller hangs up and Richard continues "showering"}}

::{{d|event|Nicole walks down the stairs and prepares to go out}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Don't worry, the dentist said the anesthetics will wear off by the end of the day, Richard, that's not a shower head. {{d|event|Chuckles}} It's an ice cream!

:{{d|Richard}}: Ohhhh. {{d|event|Starts licking the phone}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: That should keep him busy for awhile. {{d|event|Closes the door but opens it again}} There's a list of your father's chores on the fridge, make sure they're done before I get back, do ''not'' flake out on me. {{d|event|Closes the door but opens it again}} And keep an eye on your father please, the last time he was on anesthetics, I caught him smooching an electrical socket.

:{{d|Darwin}}: All right! Rock-paper-scissors for who does the first chore. {{d|event|Plays with Gumball}} One, two— {{d|event|Gumball punches his leg}} Ow! What was that for? Are you angry about something?

::{{d|event|Gumball looks away}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Do you want to tell him what it is? 

::{{d|event|Gumball shakes his head}} 

:{{d|Anais}}: Do you wanna mime it out? 

::{{d|event|Gumball sighs}}

::{{d|event|The scene switches to the exterior of the Watterson house, then to Gumball miming}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Oh! Oh! A praying mantis.

:{{d|Darwin}}: No! No! Uhh, a doggy paddle.

::{{d|event|Gumball is miming Tina}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Uh, you were climbing up a ladder and got hungry?

::{{d|event|Richard appears behind the couch}}

:{{d|Richard}}: The blue goblin's dance is making my toe sad.

::{{d|event|Richard makes a "flushing" motion and disappears behind the couch then Gumball starts make noises}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Nimble fingers!

:{{d|Gumball}}: No it's a- UGH! {{d|event|Rips off his neck brace}} It's because you flaked out on me yesterday with Tina!

::{{d|event|The oven dings, Darwin goes to the kitchen wearing oven mitts, and Gumball follows him}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I didn't flake, I just didn't help you, because you were wrong to crush Tina's piano dreams.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Agh, it doesn't matter whether I was right or wrong, we're practically brothers, what would you say if I let you down like that?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Takes out a pan of lasagna from the oven}} I would say thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.

::{{d|event|Darwin notices how hot the pan is and starts screaming}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: WHHAAAAA!!!!!! Hot hot hot hot, come on man, help me out!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I would but, I'm too busy teaching you a valuable lesson.

:{{d|Darwin}}: ANAIS, HELP ME OUT!!!

::{{d|event|Anais is on top of Richard, pulling on his ears, trying to keep him away from an electrical socket}}

:{{d|Anais}}: How about you help me instead?!

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Talking to the socket}} No need to look so scared, I will give you a little kiss and make you feel better.

::{{d|event|Darwin whimpers as he tries to open the oven with his foot, but is unable to do so}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: COME ON!

::{{d|event|Darwin runs to the sink and tries to put the lasagna down, but the countertop is full of plates and he accidentally breaks a stack of plates; Darwin runs to the counter and places the lasagna there, but it starts melting the counter so he grabs it again}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: AHH!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Alright, give it to me.

::{{d|event|Gumball tricks Darwin and lets him drop the hot pan on a chair, melting it}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Whoops!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Aw man!

::{{d|event|Darwin tosses the pan in the fridge, but it starts going down, melting every platform. It soon melts through the floor, and continues down into the earth}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, hope they like lasagna in China.

::{{d|event|Darwin slams the fridge closed and grabs a note from the fridge door}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I'll do the groceries with Anais, thank you very much.

==The Complaining==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to Elmore Shopping where Anais is riding on a trolley while Darwin pushes the trolley. Darwin is carrying a sausage in one hand}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What right does he have to crush a dream of a poor, young T-Rex, she could have made a song that only had four notes but ''noooo''. {{d|event|Anais start miming Darwin}} He makes it all a big deal like I'm the one who let him down when he's the one who let me down, you know what I mean?

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Sarcastically}} No Darwin, I have absolutely no grasp of the incredibly simple concept '''you've explained eight times already!'''

:{{d|Darwin}}: Okay, let me start from the beginning. 

::{{d|event|Anais covers her face with a cake and screams}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: All he had to do was move a plate to help me, is that really equal to me having to fight—

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the Wattersons' living room where Gumball is complaining to Richard, who is looking at his hands}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: A T-Rex! Standing over me like this! {{d|event|Mimics Tina's claws}} But instead he's more concerned with the ins and outs of the rights and wrongs—

::{{d|event|Camera zooms to Richard who is flipping his hands}}

:{{d|Richard}}: My hands don't match.

::{{d|event|Camera zooms back to Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Of acknowledging the cast iron truth that a four-fingered dinosaur cannot play the piano. {{d|event|Mimics Tina playing the piano}} Does this looks like music to you?! 

::{{d|event|Richard starts crying}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Anyways what I'm trying to say is that—

::{{d|event|Scene changes back to Darwin and Anais}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: ''He'' let ''me'' down and it's not the first time this happened—

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} Shhh-shh-shh, can you hear that?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} What?

:{{d|Anais}}: HOW GOOD IT SOUNDS WHEN YOU'RE NOT WHINING?! {{d|event|Takes a deep breath}} Now, I'm gonna say it once, if you have a problem with Gumball, you sort it out with Gumball, because ''this'' is how much I care. {{d|event|Makes a baby "spitting" face and crosses her arms}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: You're right, I'm gonna speak to him right now!

::{{d|event|Darwin drops the sausage and runs home, leaving Anais behind}}

:{{d|Anais}}: No, I meant ''after'' the shopping! Ugh! {{d|event|Tries to push the cart, but it barely moves}} Eh! Eh! Eh! This is gonna take a while.

==The Apology==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to stairwell to the attic where Darwin and Gumball are carrying a heavy computer monitor up to the attic}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Look, I just wanna say that I'm sorry, I should have been there for you and I hope you can forgive me.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, I forgive you.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Smiles for a moment, then frowns}} Don't you think you should apologize as well?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, you apologized, end of story. I'm not gonna say sorry just 'cause it'll make you feel less guilty. You are the one who let me down.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|In an angry whisper}} Oh that wasn't letting you down, this is.

::{{d|event|Darwin lets go of the computer monitor while Gumball struggles to hold it by himself}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Apologize!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Never!

::{{d|event|Darwin puts a computer case on top of the monitor while Gumball continues to struggle}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Apologize!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aghhh, Dad, help!

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Richard who is in the bathroom making silly faces at the mirror}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Hmmm, very good, WELL LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN IMITATE THIS!

::{{d|event|Richard grabs a soap bar and smashes the mirror with it. Scene changes back to Darwin and Gumball}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Apologize!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Is that all you've got left in stock?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Apologize!

::{{d|event|Darwin puts a printer on the stack of items}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aghhh, never!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Grabs a computer mouse}} This is your last chance.

::{{d|event|Gumball drops everything on Darwin's foot; Darwin takes a deep breath and then...}}

:{{D|Darwin}}: AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!! {{d|event|The windows in the neighborhood break}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Laughs}} {{d|event|Loses balance}} Darwin! Darwin, please help— help me!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Apologize.

::{{d|event|Gumball grabs the mouse that Darwin was holding and they both tumble down the stairs along with computer parts and land near the front door}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Slaps his hand on Darwin's face}} I'm sorry.

::{{d|event|Darwin slaps Gumball's hand off his face, but Gumball puts it back on Darwin's face again. This continues for a while, as Anais opens the front door, carrying a bag of groceries}}

:{{d|Anais}}: I think it's time to have a little talk.

==The Lesson==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the dining table where Anais has placed four plates of cupcakes; Darwin and Gumball are blindfolded}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Now, we need to rebuild the trust that you lost. On the plate to your right are the cupcakes, on the plate to your left is the bad food like liver and stuff.

::{{d|event|Anais winks as both plates are cupcakes and do not have bad food}}

:{{d|Anais}}: What you need to do is trust the other person to give you the good food.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sure, no problem.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin pick the cupcakes to their left and feed each other}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Delighted}} MMMMMMMM!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Removes blindfold}} Dude, I thought you tricked me.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Removes blindfold}} Me too, I expected a mouthful of rat-cake or something.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Hugs each other}} I knew I could always trust you buddy! {{d|event|Notices the trick}} But I thought the left plate was...

::{{d|event|Anais winks and the trio hugs and laughs together}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Turns dead serious}} And that's for flaking out on me at the supermarket.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Surprised}} What, what did you do?

:{{d|Anais}}: The cupcakes you just ingested were laced with parasitic eggs, all they needed to hatch was a moist, warm environment, like your ''stomach!''

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ahhh, what's gonna happen to us?

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin start touching their bodies}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Firstly, they will eat their way through your stomach lining.

:{{d|Gumball}}: WHAT? {{d|event|Touches his stomach}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Then they'll crawl up to your head and lay eggs in your eyeballs.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Pulls at his eyelids}} Take them out, I can see them already!

:{{d|Anais}}: There's only one way to lure them out.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the living room, where Gumball is whistling at Darwin's butt}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Ahh, how long we have to do this for?

::{{d|event|Darwin whistles at Gumball's butt}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Holding a smartphone}} Until they dance their way out.

::{{d|event|Anais uploads a recorded video named "Whistle Bros" to Elmore Stream-It}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Realizes the trick}} Argh, there wasn't anything in the cupcakes, was there?

:{{d|Anais}}: Nope, but there's something on the internet now.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin charge at Anais and try to snatch Anais's phone}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Gimme that phone, give it here, Anais!

:{{d|Anais}}: You should thank me, you're buddies again.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin stop snatching}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: That's true. {{d|event|Grabs pillow}} But you're still getting it!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin start hitting Anais with pillows and the trio start laughing; the phone rings}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Picks up phone}} Yes?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Hello, sweetie, I just wanted to know if your dad felt any better?

::{{d|event|Darwin looks at the front door and sees trash around the lawn}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uh, yeah, he's fine.

::{{d|event|Darwin looks out the window and sees their car is missing and all that is left are tire tracks}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Can you pass me on to him please?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uh, yeah, one minute. {{d|event|Clears his throat and tries to fake being Richard}} Hello, Mrs. Mom, what's for dinner?

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Sees right through Darwin's trick}} Really?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yep.

==Finding Dad==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the bus stop where Gumball, Darwin and Anais are running to find Richard}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Where is he, Mom must be on her way right now!

::{{d|event|Camera zooms to Darwin}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: We're gonna get our butts kicked!

::{{d|event|Scene changes to a street which is in ruins due to Richard's driving}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, who would thought the anesthetic would made him a better driver?

::{{d|event|Anais points and gasps; Scene changes to Marvin who seemed to be ran over by Richard's driving}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh my gosh, Marvin! {{d|event|Gasps}} What has Dad done?

::{{d|event|Marvin wakes up}}

:{{d|Marvin}}: Ahh, please help me up, I was trying to do sit-ups but I'm too old.

::{{d|event|The trio breathe a sigh of relief and runs off}}

:{{d|Marvin}}: Hey, what about me?

::{{d|event|Darwin comes back}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uhh ya, you can do it if you believe in yourself and don't forget to stretch when you are finished.

::{{d|event|Marvin faints again; the trio sees tire tracks on a roof of a house and runs to the backyard}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, looks like the anesthetic improved his parking too.

::{{d|event|Camera zooms out showing their car in a swimming pool}}

:{{d|Anais}}: This is not funny, we need to find him before something terrible happens.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Shocked}} LOOK, DAD'S PANTS!

::{{d|event|Scene changes to candy wonderland where Richard is chasing a tasty burger}}

:{{d|Burger}}: You want to catch me if you want to eat me!

:{{d|Richard}}: Ohhh, you little teasing bundle of fatness.

::{{d|event|Richard grabs the burger and starts nibbling it; Three condiments appears and keep saying "sauce"}}

:{{d|Richard}}: No thank you, he's delicious just the way he is.

::{{d|event|Scene changes back to reality; Richard is actually nibbling Rocky and the condiments are actually Gumball, Darwin and Anais}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{D|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: Stop! Stop! Stop!

:{{d|Rocky}}: Dude stop, its not funny anymore, its just weird!

::{{d|event|Rocky breaks free but Richard still continues to chase him; scene changes to Nicole driving back home}}

:{{d|Radio}}: Radio Elmore, news flash, we are receiving reports of a fat, pant-less, pink middle-age man-bunny causing disturbance in the city of Elmore. {{d|event|Nicole looks surprised}} He's reported to have attacked and nibbled several bystanders, one extremely—

::{{d|event|Radio starts fading and Nicole bends down to tune it; Richard and Rocky are seen running past the car}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Come on.

::{{d|event|Rocky and Richard run past the car; Nicole gets up but did not see Rocky or Richard}}

:{{d|Radio}}: And now the weather. Diane?

==The Plan==
::{{d|event|Scene changes back to the trio, tired from chasing Richard}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Did you see that? It was Mrs. Mom's car!

:{{d|Anais}}: Right! We've got to split up! Gumball, you sort out the house. Darwin, you try and delay Mom. I'll take care of Dad! Go! 

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin start running}} 

:{{d|Anais}}: And no flaking out!

::{{d|event|Darwin picks up a can of white paint and draws lines all over a carpark; Camera shows Nicole driving her car into the carpark}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: What?

::{{d|event|Nicole drives into a "dead end"}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Sighs angrily}}

::{{d|event|Nicole backtracks and drives off; Scene changes to Anais riding on Richard, throwing peanuts to guide Richard; Anais notices Nicole's car as she drives toward them}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Oh no. {{d|event|Throws several peanuts}} COME ON!!

::{{d|event|Richard leaps, and starts running through the neighborhood fences while Anais screams all the way; Scene changes to the Wattersons' kitchen where Gumball tries to fix the kitchen by gluing a book on the burned counter; Scene changes to Darwin wearing sunglasses in a telephone booth}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|In a deep manly voice}} Uh hey, I'd like to report a stolen yellow family wagon.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the Donut Cop arresting Nicole}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: I didn't do anything, you've got to believe me.

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: We'll see about that, lady. Let's just see those papers first.

::{{d|event|The Donut Cop takes a license out of Nicole's pocket; Darwin appears at the back of the police car and takes a wheel clamp out of the trunk; Scene changes to Anais and Richard, who is still ramming through fences while Anais throws peanuts in front of him; Scene changes to Miss Simian using a lawnmower and Principal Brown reading a book; Richard bumps into Miss Simian, causing her to accidentally shave off Principal Brown's fur, and then Brown covers his exposed body; Scene changes to the Wattersons' kitchen where Gumball sweeps up the broken plates, grinds them using the blender then pours the remains into an empty pack of sugar; Scene changes back to Anais and Richard ramming through fences again, but then Richard hits a female garden gnome, causing the male garden gnome beside her to shed a tear; Scene changes back to the Wattersons' kitchen where Gumball pushes all the remaining junk down the hole in the fridge, and then he nails the fridge doors; Scene changes to Nicole as she drives her car with a clamp on one of the wheels; Scene changes to Anais and Richard ramming through several fences again, and then shows the Wattersons' bathroom as Gumball tapes a sheet of paper on the broken mirror and tries to draw the bathroom and an angry Nicole; Scene changes back to Nicole driving then camera changes to Darwin running across the street and into the house, then camera changes to show Anais and Richard entering the house via the back door; everybody sits on the couch just as Nicole slams open the front door}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: HOW COULD YOU LOSE YOUR OWN FATHER, YOU LET HIM DOWN AND YOU LET ME DOWN-

:{{d|Gumball}}: He's here.

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Surprised, but angry again}} I-a, how could you not do your chores when I specifically asked-

:{{d|Anais}}: Mom, they're all done.

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Surprised again, not angry but confused}} I- you- how could you-

:{{d|Darwin}}: Everything is fine, Mrs. Mom.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, well, I guess I'm sorry for doubting you kids.

::{{d|event|Richard's anesthetics wear off}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Ohhhh, ah, I had the weirdest dream, Darwin burned the kitchen, Gumball smashed the computer, I'm pretty sure I drove the car into the swimming pool, and at some point I remember nibbling a couple of people.

::{{d|event|Nicole looks angrily at the kids}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Look down in disappointment and sigh}} Flaker.
