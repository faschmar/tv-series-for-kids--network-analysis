==Please Mom!==
::{{d|event|At the beginning of the episode, Nicole is leaving home via the front door. With Gumball clinging to her leg, and Darwin clinging to Gumball, she drags both of them behind her}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Please, Mom! Please?

:{{d|Darwin}}: S'il vous plaît?

:{{d|Gumball}}: ¿Por favor?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Bitte?

::{{d|event|Nicole turns to face her sons as they adopt a kneeling position}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: We really wanna do karate.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: 'Olu 'olu?

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Okay.

::{{d|event|The show skips ahead to Nicole driving her car, while Gumball and Darwin are in the backseat wearing karate uniforms}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Yay!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Better not get bored and give it up right away.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mom, when have we ever given something up?

::{{d|event|A series of flashbacks starts; Gumball and Darwin are seen practicing different sports. Every time Gumball and Darwin throw their equipment, a meter fills with 100 dollars and a cash sound effect plays}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Throwing their equipment}} I hate football! I hate tennis! I hate whipping horses!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are peacefully skating, when Gumball suddently slams Darwin onto the ice rink}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I hate figure skating!

::{{d|event|The meter fills up with 700 more dollars and the flashbacks end}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, yeah.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Promise me you'll go to the lessons this time.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Scoffs}} Pff. Who needs lessons? You already bought us black belts!

::{{d|event|Another 500 dollars pile up on the meter. Then Gumball and Darwin pretend to attack each other, and Nicole sighs}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, you look so powerful in your belt.

:{{d|Gumball}}: You too, man.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Really?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah. You're like half shark, half bear, half alligator.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Shark-bear-igator.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Darwin, let's agree to ''never'' take these off.

::{{d|event|They shake hands}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Agreed!

==Goofy Gi's==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are at home and getting ready for school. They brush their teeth, after which Gumball runs downstairs and tries to jump kick the door}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hi-yah!

::{{d|event|He smacks against it and drops to the floor, causing a painting to fall from the wall and onto his face. Next, Gumball pours cereal into a bowl and spins a spoon in his hand}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Woo, yah-wah! Haa-yah! {{d|event|Throws the spoon at Darwin}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yah! {{d|event|Catches the spoon between his fins}} Wahhh. {{d|event|Eats the cereal}}

::{{d|event|Outside, Gumball does a cartwheel, then kicks the bus sign. Darwin follows after him by doing somersaults. The bus pulls up, and the scene skips to the end of the school day. Gumball and Darwin are standing on the sidewalk in front of some of their classmates, and Nicole drives up to collect them}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: That was the best day of my life! {{d|event|Performing karate moves}} Yah! Yah! Yah!

::{{d|event|Every student, except Penny, laughs}}

:{{d|Masami}}: Hey, why don't you fight Tina?

::{{d|event|They continue laughing}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, no-no-no. Our karate is strictly for self-defense.

:{{d|Darwin}}: To misuse the power in this fin would bring terrible dishonor upon our dojo.

:{{d|Banana joe}}: Haha, do another flip!

::{{d|event|They laugh again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: All right, just one more. Ha, for the fans... {{d|event|Attempts a backflip, but lands face-first}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Awesome!

::{{d|event|Everyone laughs}}

:{{d|Banana joe}}: Kung-fool!

::{{d|event|Nicole watches from the car, upset}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Boys, come on! Time to go.

:{{d|Gumball}}: One second, Mom! {{d|event|Walks up to Penny}} Hey, Penny! Hi-yah. {{d|event|Punches the air, startling her}} What do you think of my new style?

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Mmm. Very, um...

:{{d|Gumball}}: Impressive?

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Well... I like to see you happy.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Thanks! Wa! {{d|event|Fakes another punch}} You need work on that defense, young lotus. Farewell.

::{{d|event|He gets into the passenger seat, Darwin sits in the back, and they head for home}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hi-yah!

::{{d|event|Gumball pretends to hit Nicole, nearly making her lose control of the vehicle}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Flinched!

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Chuckles nervously}} Everything okay at school, honey?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, school is awesome! Especially when you're wearing one of these.

:{{d|Nicole}}: It's just that it... kinda looked like the kids were making fun of you back there.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah... Laughing ''with'' you can sound like laughing ''at'' you.

:{{d|Darwin}}: They even called us the karate wieners!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I think it's because we always "wien" at karate.

==The Inner Warrior==
::{{d|event|Back home, Richard is sitting on the couch playing a videogame. Gumball and Darwin are next to him}}

:{{d|Videogame announcer}}: Suburban Karate Master.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|After beating some enemies}} Ha ha, in your face! Oh, I wish I could kick people like this in real life. {{d|event|Notices Gumball and Darwin}} Hey, nice costumes, guys. {{d|event|Hushed}} You have a spare one?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Nah, sorry, Dad. I'm not sure you're ready for the responsibility.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Sighs sadly}} I understand. {{d|event|Continues playing}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on, Darwin. Let's go practice some killer moves!

::{{d|event|They go to the front yard and stand beside a boombox}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, dude. You know what a true warrior needs for a good warm-up?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Mittens and a scarf?

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, Darwin-san. {{d|event|Turns on the boombox}} Inspiration.

::{{d|event|Rock music plays; Gumball and Darwin lip-sync and dance to the song}}

:{{d|Lyrics}}: ''Every time I look in the mirror all I see is the inner warrior staring back at me!''

:''You hit hard with your best shot, give it everything you've got. Warrior, be the warrior!''

::{{d|event|Nicole and Richard are watching from the window}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Faces Richard}} Oh, Richard, I'm so worried about them.

::{{d|event|Richard turns around, revealing that he is also lip-syncing and air-guitaring}}

:{{d|Lyrics}}: ''Bring 'em on, let 'em come, they will never keep you down.''

:{{d|Richard}}: Why? It's a great track.

:{{d|Nicole}}: They're obsessed with those outfits, and the kids at school are making fun of them. {{d|event|Looks at her sons}}

:{{d|Lyrics}}: ''Come on, Warrior! Be the Warrior!''

:{{d|Nicole}}: You know how mean kids can be.

:{{d|Lyrics}}: ''And you're the best that you can be.''

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Turns away from the window}} Richard? {{d|event|Sees him outside with Gumball and Darwin; Groans, then sighs}} I know they're just costumes, but if people make fun of them, they'll never get girlfriends, or a job, and in twenty years' time they'll still be living here and wearing those ridiculous karate outfits!

::{{d|event|Nicole imagines what Gumball and Darwin will be like in the future. She pictures them overweight, unkempt, and playing a videogame in the living room}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Gumball?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah?

:{{d|Darwin}}: I think we wasted our lives.

::{{d|event|End of Nicole's imagine spot}}

==Tae-Kwon Dorks==
::{{d|event|Later, Gumball and Darwin are using the computer in their bedroom when Nicole walks in}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Boys?

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Hi, Mom!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Check out Darwin's sweet scissor kick. {{d|event|Plays a video of Darwin kicking a can}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: When did you post this?

:{{d|Gumball}}: We didn't. Some kids at school did.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Boys, look at the title. "Tae-Kwon Dorks." I think they might be making fun of you.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Nah, they just spelled "Tae-Kwon Do" wrong.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Korean spelling is very complicated.

:{{d|Gumball}}: There's loads of other fellow senseis on here. Look! 

::{{d|event|Gumball plays a video called "Awesome brick break", where a black belt breaks a row of bricks just by using his hand. Nicole suddenly unplugs the computer}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey!

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} I need to tell you a story.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Cool! Is it a fable about a great martial arts warrior?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Not exactly. When your father was at school, he thought he was the "Cottontail Cavalier."

::{{d|event|Flashback to the time when Richard was still in Elmore Junior High}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Cottontail Cavalier! {{d|event|Runs around in his costume, only to crash head-on into his classroom door}}

:{{d|Mister Small}}​​, {{d|Sal Left Thumb}}, and {{d|Mr. Fitzgerald}}: {{d|event|Laughing}} Costumed geek!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Leave him alone! At least he's brave enough to be himself.

::{{d|event|Flashback ends}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: He was lucky there was one girl who loved him for who he really was.

:{{d|Darwin}}: What a sad story.

:{{d|Gumball}}: But, what ever happened to the cape?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Well, I managed to get it off him and hide it.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Appears in the doorway; Upset}} What?! You mean the president didn't really need my cape?

:{{d|Nicole}}: I'm sorry, honey.

:{{d|Richard}}: It's because of you I'm mortal! {{d|event|Runs away crying}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: You see, that's the kind of state that you can get into when you refuse to grow up.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Dejected}} Gumball, I don't wanna be a costumed geek.

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's okay, Darwin. Mom, we'll stop wearing the outfits if it'll make you happy.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Thank you, boys. I'm so proud of you. You'll see, it's for the best.

::{{d|event|After she leaves, Gumball and Darwin gaze out their window and sing "No More Gi"}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: ''Life's about abandoning, dream after dream.''

:{{d|Darwin}}: ''Hopes and expectations, float away downstream.''

:{{d|Gumball}}: ''It's time to kiss our childish ways goodbye.''

:{{d|Darwin}}: ''Grow up? Give mediocrity a try?''

:{{d|Gumball}}: ''The games, they have to stop.''

::{{d|event|The two remove their headbands}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: ''No more hi-yah!''

:{{d|Gumball}}: ''Not even a karate chop.''

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: ''Face up to what maturity means, and forget about our martial arts dreams.''

::{{d|event|They store the outfits in a suitcase and slide it under the bed}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, I think I'm cured.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Me too! I almost think I could put it back on, you know, just one last time, and I would be fine.

:{{d|Gumball}}: I reckon if I put mine back on, it would do nothing.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin dress up again and lie on the floor while laughing ecstatically}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, it feels so good!

==The Karate "Wieners"==
::{{d|event|The next day, Gumball and Darwin try to sneak out of the house by wearing their outfits under regular clothing. Nicole hears them open the front door and comes out of the kitchen}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Boys? Is that you?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh... yeah, just rushing off to school, you know? Don't wanna miss any of those, uh, spelling... sums.

:{{d|Nicole}}: That's great honey. Now, where did you put those karate costumes?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Those old things? I completely forgot about them.

:{{d|Nicole}}: But you had them only yesterday.

:{{d|Gumball}}: That was yesterday? Well, time sure flies when you're all grown up. {{d|event|To Darwin}} Can you remember where we put them?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Beats me.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Maybe they're in the closet, bye! {{d|event|Rushes out, slamming the door}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Bye. And now, to get rid of this problem once and for all. {{d|event|Opens the bedroom closet}} What the? They're gone! Wait a minute. 

::{{d|event|Nicole rewinds her memory}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Bye!

::{{d|event|Nicole replays the memory in slow motion}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Bye!

::{{d|event|She replays it even slower, spotting the sleeve of Gumball's gi under his sweater}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Bye!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Those little fibbers!

::{{d|event|At school, Gumball and Darwin are in the corridor, standing by the lockers}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, let's get these dorky clothes off.

:{{d|Darwin}}: I don't know, I think I'm gonna keep mine on.

:{{d|Gumball}}: What?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Mom's kinda right, this is a bit lame.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Are you crazy? {{d|event|Punches the air, then poses on one leg}} Is ''that'' lame?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Nah, it's pretty awesome.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Exactly! Now, our fans are waiting. The Karate Weiners, have returned! {{d|event|Rips off his extra clothes}}

::{{d|event|The nearby students all laugh}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: People, please, contain your excitement. At lunch break, come and see me attempt... the impossible!

:{{d|Jamie}}: What? Are you gonna get a girlfriend?

::{{d|event|They laugh again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, I'm going to break twelve planks of wood with this hand! {{d|event|Raises his hand}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} Are you crazy?

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, Darwin, I'M MORE SANE THAN I'VE EVER BEEN!

::{{d|event|Scene cuts to Nicole rapidly driving on the highway}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Angrily}} I can't believe they lied to me. I never should've given them those outfits! What was I thinking? {{d|event|Honks the horn}} Out of my way! My kids are in danger! Of becoming their father!

::{{d|event|At the school playground, Gumball is preparing to strike the planks in front of him}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, seriously, how're you gonna do this?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ha, easy! I've seen loads of guys do it on the internet. All I have to do is hit it with my hand. Watch! {{d|event|To the gathered crowd}} Karate fans please, can I have a little hush?

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Yeah, quiet! I wanna hear him fail.

::{{d|event|All the classmates laugh at Gumball}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Shhhh!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Thank you, Darwin-san. {{d|event|Inhales deeply}} HI-YAH!

::{{d|event|Gumball hits the wood, injuring his hand as he whimpers in pain. The classmates continue to laugh}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Stop laughing! Don't you guys watch TV?! When you believe in yourself you can accomplish anything!

::{{d|event|He ineffectively hits the planks a few more times with his hands, then tries using his head}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Speaking into the wood}} Aww man, it looked easier on the internet. {{d|event|Stands up}} Maybe I'll just do one plank.

::{{d|event|Darwin removes all the planks except for one}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Inhales deeply}} HI-YAH!

::{{d|event|He stomps on the plank, to no effect, and growls. When he kicks the plank, it flies into his face, causing him to cry and fall forward, with the students still laughing}}

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: Ladies and gentlemen, the karate "wiener"!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hang on, wiener doesn't mean winner, it means sausage! {{d|event|Sobs}}

::{{d|event|Nicole drives up on the other side of the fence}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, no, I'm too late.

::{{d|event|Penny runs up to Gumball looking worried}}

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Hey, leave him alone! If he wants to wear karate clothes, let him! At least he's brave enough to be himself!

::{{d|e|Nicole gasps in awe}}

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Besides, I think he looks cute, kinda like a... a...

:{{d|Darwin}}: Shark-bear-igator?

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: Yeah, something like that.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispering to Darwin}} I told you girls would dig it! Thanks for sticking up for me, Penny!

:{{d|Shell Penny}}: My pleasure, Gumball-san.

::{{d|event|They pretend to attack each other, then laugh together}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Ohh, my little karate weiner's in love! {{d|event|Ponders}}

==Return of the Cottontail Cavalier==
::{{d|event|In the living room, Richard is still playing a videogame when Nicole walks up to him}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Richard?

:{{d|Richard}}: Yeah?

:{{d|Nicole}}: The president wants you to have this back. {{d|event|Pulls out a cape}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Excited}} Aah! Really?! {{d|event|Grabs cape}} I can feel its power!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Well, put it on.

:{{d|Richard}}: Yes! The "Cottontail Cavalier" has returned! {{d|event|Runs around the sofa}} Dun-dun-dun-dun-d— {{d|event|Crashes into a wall; laughs}} Ahh, just like old times.

::{{d|event|Nicole gives Richard a kiss on the cheek}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Oh, thanks, honey!
