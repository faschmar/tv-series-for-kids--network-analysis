==Lick That Elbow==
::{{d|e|The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin walking through the Elmore Junior High corridor. Darwin has a chipped tooth and a black eye, while Gumball is trying to lick his elbow}}
:{{d|darwin}}: {{d|e|Lisping}} I'm telling you, it's impossible. I tried and this is what happened.
:{{d|gumball}}: That can't possibly explain how you can chip a tooth while trying to lick your elbow. {{d|e|Smashes into an opened locker door, giving him a black eye and a chipped tooth just like Darwin's}} Ah.
::{{d|e|The scene switches to the nurse's office as Mr. Corneille walks in. Joan sees Mr. Corneille has a black eye and a chipped tooth}}
:{{d|Joan}}: {{d|e|Gasps}} Mr. Corneille, your face! What happened?
:{{d|corneille}}: Pretty momma, handsome daddy. {{d|e|Clicks tongue and points his thumbs towards his face}}
:{{d|Joan}}: No, I meant your black eye.
:{{d|corneille}}: Hah, you should see the other guys. {{d|e|Points backwards as Gumball and Darwin enters the nurse's office}}
:{{d|gumball}} and {{d|darwin}}: Hi, Mr. Corneille.
:{{d|corneille}}: {{d|e|Nervously laughs}} I cannot stress strongly enough, these are not the other guys.
:{{d|gumball}}: What happened to your face?
:{{d|corneille}}: Oh, I just walked into the cage and got hurt.
:{{d|gumball}}: What? You got into the cage, like, you’re an MMMMA fighter?
::{{d|e|Mr. Corneille tries to explain further but Joan cuts him off by reacting romantically. He goes with it and nods at her}}
:{{d|darwin}}: What is that?
:{{d|gumball}}: Meaty Men Misunderstanding Martial Arts.
:{{d|darwin}}: Sounds kinda violent.
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Blows raspberry}} Only according to the so-called “medical community.”
:{{d|Joan}}: {{d|e|Romantic voice}} Oh, Mr. Corneille, who knew you’d be so- {{d|e|Squeezes Mr. Corneille's arm, returns to normal voice}} oh, that arm feels a lot more withered than I thought it was gonna be.
:{{d|corneille}}: Well when you're fighting in the cage, the most important muscle is the heart. And right now, you’re giving mine a workout.
::{{d|e|As Joan and Mr. Corneille giggle and blush, Gumball, with tears and snot on his face, rises up behind them}}
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|e|Whispers}} Teach us.
:{{d|corneille}}: Uh, I-I don’t know, I-
::{{d|e|Gumball's head abruptly grows big, knocking down Joan, Darwin, and Mr. Corneille}}
:{{d|gumball}}: TEACH US!!

==MMMMA Training==
::{{d|e|Transition to the gym}}
:{{d|corneille}}: The men who step into the cage love what they do. And by stepping into it, you're saying to your opponent, "I love you. But I'm gonna punch you in the body with my body with so much love that you pass out."
:{{d|gumball}}: What? I thought you were gonna teach us how to become tough fighter guys.
:{{d|corneille}}: But if you rearrange the letters of "tough fighter guy," you get "tighter of hug guy." Coincidence? Yes, but a useful one. Come, let's get started.
::{{d|e|Gumball and Darwin try to perform mildly violent moves but instead keep performing friendly ones. While Darwin is rubbing Gumball's chin, causing him to purr, Principal Brown shows up}}
:{{d|brown}}: I'm uh, sorry to interrupt whatever that is but I'm afraid I have some bad news. There have been some budget cuts and the school board has agreed to rent out half the school to another..."institution." So, I'm afraid you have to leave.
:{{d|gumball}}: Surely, there is a better solution.
:{{d|brown}}: This is our last resort. We've already cut everything we can from the budget. Look, {{d|e|points backwards}} those aren't even real fire extinguishers. They're just canisters of dippy string. If a fire starts in this school, things are gonna get very dippy... Also pretty tragic.
:{{d|darwin}}: So, you're just gonna privatize the school like some kind of prison?
:{{d|brown}}: Funny you should say that- {{d|e|An alarm goes off}} Oh-ho-ho, don't worry. Just means one of your new "classmates" has escaped. We'll know if everything really bad happens because the big siren will go- {{d|e|Another alarm goes off. Gumball and Darwin begin to feel uneasy. Principal Brown is seen leaving the gym}}

==MMMMA Challenger Fight==
:{{d|e|Gumball and Darwin are shown walking through town}}
::{{d|gumball}}: What's happened to our school is a disaster. The forced exercise, the communal showers, the canteen slop, the unpaid work, the abuse of power. And if that wasn't enough, now with the prisoners it's gonna be overcrowded too!
::{{d|darwin}}: There must be a solution.
:::{{d|e|A flyer hits Gumball in the face. He throws it aside, but it hits his face again. In frustration, Gumball crumples the flyer into a ball and kicks it upwards. The flyer unravels and hits Gumball once again. When Gumball is about to tear it to pieces, Darwin stops him}}
::{{d|darwin}}: Wait, maybe that poster's fate hitting us right in the face with the answer to our problem.
:::{{d|e|Gumball looks at the flyer, which depicts a woman, in tears, running away from another woman}}
::{{d|gumball}}: Hair Force Gone. Full body waxing. Tell us when to stop, we won't listen.
::{{d|darwin}}: No, I meant that one. {{d|e|Points at the billboard}}
::{{d|gumball}}: {{d|e|Gasps}} An MMMMA Challenger Fight!
:::{{d|e|Cut to school corridor near the nurse's office, Gumball and Darwin both stare at Mr. Corneille excitedly}}
::{{d|corneille}}: {{d|e|Casually laughs}} I'm sorry, but I don't fight for money. Violence is never the best solution.
::{{d|gumball}}: What about the nurse? She wouldn't even have a job if people didn't get hurt.
::{{d|Joan}}: {{d|e|Steps into the hallway}} My alibi is watertight. Unlike that boat the previous nurse was in. {{d|e|Short pause}} I mean... {{d|e|Takes Mr. Corneille's hands, making him blush}} Mr. Corneille, surely you'll fight if it means saving the school.
::{{d|corneille}}: But to go back into the cage, I'm gonna need a whole support team. Even a medic.
:::{{d|e|Gumball pops up behind Mr. Corneille}}
::{{d|gumball}}: I'll patch you up.
::{{d|corneille}}: {{d|e|Kicks Gumball away}} I meant someone qualified, someone who knows how to use a scalpel and no, that doesn't mean you either, Frank the Butcher.
:::{{d|e|Frank is shown standing nearby, sighs, and then walks away}}
::{{d|corneille}}: So what do you say, Ms. Markham?
::{{d|joan}}: {{d|e|Removes her cap, making her hair unravel}} Please Mr. Corneille, let's lose the formalities. My name is Joan.
::{{d|corneille}}: Mine is Moonchild.
::{{d|joan}}: I'll stick with Corneille.
::{{d|corneille}}: Fair enough.
:::{{d|e|Gumball pops up behind Mr. Corneille again}}
::{{d|gumball}}: So, you'll fight then?
::{{d|corneille}}: Absolutely.

==Mr. Corneille Joins the Fight==
:{{d|e|The scene crossfades to a press conference}}

:{{d|Melted Cheese Guy}}: Time for the weigh-in.
::{{d|e|Mr. Corneille steps onto a scale. His weight is barely ten pounds. After that, a rumbling sound is heard. Mr. Corneille looks at his opponent with an intimidated look. The opponent's fist-like feet step onto the scale, which breaks under his girth. The camera pans back to reveal this opponent's head and hands are fists as well. The opponent growls at Mr. Corneille. A flash transitions to Melted Cheese Guy introducing the two fighters}}
:{{d|Melted Cheese Guy}}: On my right, we have the reigning champion, Joao "The Grave" Diga!
::{{d|e|Joao is shown to Melted Cheese Guy's right, with Gumball and Darwin sitting opposite Melted Cheese Guy. Joao slams down into his seat, making the crowd stop cheering}}
:{{d|Melted Cheese Guy}}: And on my left, we have the challenger... {{d|e|Whispers to Gumball}} What's his name, kid?
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|e|Whispers to Darwin}} Quick! We need a name.
:{{d|darwin}}: Oh, oh, I got it, The Frog Prince.
:{{d|gumball}}: Sounds like he's gonna get kissed, by a fist.
:{{d|darwin}}: The Croaker.
:{{d|gumball}}: That's like he all he does, is croak.
:{{d|darwin}}: The Frogspawn.
:{{d|gumball}}: Nah, that's just gross.
:{{d|darwin}}: Colonel Jazzhand, The Germinate Crawler.
:{{d|gumball}}: Pfft.
:{{d|darwin}}: The Birthday Boy. {{d|e|Gumball shakes his head}} The Summertime Man. Wait, I've got it! Look out, it's Christmas Person.
:{{d|gumball}}: Are you having a brain cramp?
:{{d|darwin}}: Why don't you do better then?
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|e|Whispers to Melted Cheese Guy}} The Amphi-Barbarian.
:{{d|Melted Cheese Guy}}: The Amphi-Barbarian!
:{{d|darwin}}: Nah, that's better.
::{{d|e|A small amount of people in the audience are heard clapping as Mr. Corneille shows up and sits down casually}}
:{{d|Someone at the Audience}}: Where's the rest of him? {{d|event|Cut to Mike in the audience}}
:{{d|Mike}}: He looks like one of those before-and-after ads but before the gym and after a disease.
::{{d|e|Audience laughs}}
:{{d|gumball}}: You don't have to take that.
:{{d|Joao}}: This man is a joke! {{d|e|Slams table and stands up}} You want a joke!? When I finish with you, {{d|event|Shows his fist, pointing a finger at him revealing another hand, also pointing at him}} they'll have to send your teeth to you in the mail. {{d|event|Moves back his fist and sits down}} Because the teeth will have landed far away and the postal service is the most practical way for you to retrieve them and avoid the necessity of going there on foot.
:{{d|gumball}}: Oh! Oh! Trash talking time! {{d|e|Clears throat}} Oh yeah? Well I heard you train twenty-four seven, which I guess you have the freedom to do when you don't have any meaningful relationships! Whaa?? {{d|e|Joao slams the table in anger. Melted Cheese Guy ducks below the table}} Heh. Being so rich and successful, it must be difficult to know whether your friends like you for your fame or for your lack of personality. {{d|e|Joao growls loudly. Gumball then stands right in front of Joao's face}} You know what's really loud, Joao? Insecurity. Confidence is silent, {{d|e|Whispers}} just like your empty mansion. {{d|e|Joao growls in anger. Melted Cheese Guy separates him and Gumball}}
::{{d|Melted Cheese Guy}}: Gentlemen, please! Save it for the fight.
:{{d|Joao}}: Before this, I was just gonna bake you. But now, I am going to end you!
::{{d|e|Audience cheers again}}

==Art of Training==
::{{d|e|Gumball, Darwin, and Mr. Corneille are at at the park. Mr. Corneille is meditating}}
:{{d|darwin}}: Mr. Corneille, aren't you little concerned what Joao said?
:{{d|gumball}}: Yeah, shouldn't you be like, training instead of meditating? Wait a minute. {{d|e|Hears Mr. Corneille snoring}} Ugh, {{d|e|Moves Mr. Corneille's arm, waking him up}} come on! How can you sleep when your opponent is capable of ''this''? {{d|e|Gumball grabs his phone and shows Mr. Corneille a video of Joao punching a battleship, causing it to immediately sink}} That was a friendly match against the U.S. Navy. The week after that, he was scheduled to fight Belgium.
:{{d|darwin}}: Fight who in Belgium?
:{{d|gumball}}: The whole country. But they forfeited when they saw what he did to the ship.
:{{d|corneille}}: Kids, you need to relax. I have a plan. Let that guy wear himself out with the grueling training schedule while I save my energy. I call it the art of training, without training. Cue montage.
::{{d|e|Cut to Mr. Corneille's office. Mr. Corneille is sitting with his feet on the table, reading, while Gumball and Darwin watch him "training" with excited looks. "Take a Rest, Sit Down" plays through the entire scene from Mr. Corneille's radio}}
:{{d|Voice}}: Take a rest, sit down
:Let the other guy do the runnin' round
:Take a rest, lie down
:Ditch the track suit for a dressin' gown

{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin stop with their excited faces and smile instead}}

:Try to relax, don't tire yourself out
:Avoid any form of training {{d|event|Gumball and Darwin stop smiling}}
:Like seriously, dude, workin' hard at stuff
:Is dumb and super draining
:Ba-da ditty, I'm just filling time {{d|event|Gumball and Darwin make disgusted faces}}
:I'm not even gonna make it rhyme
:But, oh, my goodness, that bit rhymed accidentally
:Well, here's the chorus again

{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin stare at each other with bored faces}}

:Take a rest, sit down
:{{d|event|Sighs}} Somethin' about runnin'
:Take a... {{d|event|Yawns}}
::{{d|e|Gumball and Darwin stare angrily at Mr. Corneille. Mr. Corneille tries to stretch, but his back breaks}}
:{{d|corneille}}: {{d|event|In agony}} Ahh! My neck!
::{{d|e|Scene turns black}}

==Pulling Mr. Corneille Out of the Fight==
::{{d|e|We see the Elmore Junior High, now outfitted with barbed wires, window barriers, a chain-link fence, and security cameras. A prisoner can be seen sweeping outside, and a French Fry cop is holding a weapon, guarding the top of the school. Inside the nurse's office, Gumball and Darwin watch Joan massage Mr. Corneille}}
:{{d|gumball}}: I'm sorry, but as your trainer, I must tell you that you cannot fight in this condition.
:{{d|corneille}}: It's just a crick in the neck.
:{{d|gumball}}: No, I meant you're really physically underdeveloped. Which is a polite way to say that I've seen stronger limbs on discarded Christmas trees in March, and that you're gonna get your butt handed to you. In an urn.
:{{d|corneille}}: Ey, don't worry, kids. I've studied video footage of Joao. He has a telltale sign just before he hits.
:{{d|darwin}}: What is it?
:{{d|corneille}}: He curls his fingers into a fist, {{d|e|Balls his hand up}} and raises his arm. {{d|e|Raises his own arm}} Ahh, come on kids, lighten up. Ninety percent of the fight is one of the mind. All you need to do is believe in me. Can you do that?
::{{d|e|Gumball and Darwin sigh}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Okay.
::{{d|e|The scene abruptly changes to Gumball angrily calling Joao's manager}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Hey, is this Joao's Manager? Yeah, this is Corneille's team, we wanna pull out of the fight.
:{{d|Joao's Manager}}: {{d|event|Spits coffee through phone, splattering it all over Gumball and Darwin}} WHAT!?
:{{d|gumball}}: We're forfeiting.
:{{d|Joao's Manager}}: {{d|event|Spits coffee through phone again}} You can't do that on the day of the fight! Okay, I can give you an extra ten-thousand.
:{{d|gumball}}: Yep- nah, we just wanna pull out.
::{{d|e|Gumball tries to protect his face from the coffee. He lowers his arm when no coffee comes through the phone, but as soon as he does, Joao's manager spits coffee again}}
:{{d|Joao's Manager}}: Sorry, had to make another pot. Listen, this is my last offer. Your guy goes down in the first round, and we split the ticket sales.
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} It's not about the money, we just don't want him to get hurt.
:{{d|Joao's Manager}}: {{d|e|Spits coffee}} Fine! Seventy percent for you, thirty percent for me!
:{{d|gumball}}: You don't understa-
:{{d|Joao's Manager}}: {{d|e|Spits coffee}} NINETY, TEN! YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE, KID!
:{{d|gumball}}: Okay, {{d|e|Wipes off coffee on his face}} I think you're drinking too much coffee, sir. It's bad for your health.
:{{d|Joao's Manager}}: {{d|e|Spits coffee}} Too much coffee is bad for your health! Listen, I promise you, I will go easy on your guy. Then we can save your school. Do we have a deal?
:{{d|gumball}}: O-oka- {{d|event|Gets cut off by Joao's manager spitting coffee again}} OH COME ON, MAN!
:{{d|Joao's Manager}}: Sorry, I just really didn't expect you go with that last deal.
::{{d|e|Gumball hangs up the phone. He and Darwin then notice Mr. Corneille is behind them and heard the entire conversation}}
:{{d|corneille}}: So, it's like that, huh?
::{{d|e|Mr. Corneille sadly walks away. Gumball and Darwin shake their heads to get rid of the coffee, and follow Mr. Corneille}}
:{{d|darwin}}: Look, sir, it's not that we don't believe in you...
:{{d|gumball}}: It's that we know you can't win.
:{{d|corneille}}: Of course, I can!
:{{d|gumball}}: How!? Show us. How on Earth are you gonna hit this guy?
:{{d|corneille}}: With my heart! LIKE THIS! {{d|e|Punches the wall, leaving a hole in it. Gumball and Darwin stare in shock}} Just leave me to it. And don't bother coming. {{d|e|Walks away}}
::{{d|e|Gumball and Darwin look through the hole in the wall. They both smile at each other, now believing Mr. Corneille actually can win the fight}}

==The Fight==
::{{d|e|At the stadium, Joao stands inside the ring as the onlooking audience cheers. Inside the locker room, Mr. Corneille is sitting on a bench, wearing a purple robe. Someone opens the door}}
:{{d|Announcer}}: It's time.
::{{d|e|Mr. Corneille walks to the fighting ring, taking deep breaths. The crowd cheers. He sees Gumball, Darwin and Joan near the cage. Mr. Corneille smiles and hugs Gumball and Darwin}}
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|e|Holds Mr. Corneille's head}} Win. We believe in you.
::{{d|e|Mr. Corneille nods and sheds a tear. He approaches Joan and holds her hands}}
:{{d|Joan}}: Look, Mr. Corneille, I- {{d|e|Mr. Corneille kisses Joan}} Go get him.
::{{d|e|Mr. Corneille enters the ring and removes his robe. He approaches Gumball and Darwin near the cage}}
:{{d|corneille}}: Kids, thank you in believing in me when I didn't even believe in myself. And the reason I didn't believe in myself was because I knew I was lying all along.
::{{d|e|Gumball and Darwin are surprised by this revelation}}
:{{d|gumball}}: Wait, what?
:{{d|corneille}}: I'm not a fighter, I just lied because I wanted to smooch the nurse! {{d|event|Winks}}
:{{d|darwin}}: But your black eye? You said you got hurt in the cage?
:{{d|corneille}}: When I said I walked into the cage, I meant I walked into the hamster cage... {{d|e|Gumball and Darwin stare at him in surprise. Mr. Corneille points to his elbow}} I was trying to lick my elbow after hearing it was impossible.
:{{d|darwin}}: You lied?
:{{d|corneille}}: Lies are only facts, that haven't happened.
:{{d|gumball}}: Are you insane!? Get out of the ring!
:{{d|corneille}}: No! I may not have been a fighter when I started, but I am now. Thanks to your belief {{d|event|Gumball and Darwin bite their bottom lips in shock}}, you saw what I did to that wall. I got this!
::{{d|e|Joan and Principal Brown walk next to Gumball and Darwin. Inside the ring, Mr. Corneille and Joao looks sharply at each other. Melted Cheese Guy backs them up a bit}}
:{{d|Melted Cheese Guy}}: Ready?
:{{d|brown}}: {{d|event|Cut to Gumball, Darwin, Joan, and Principal Brown, all with nervous faces. To Gumball}} Was he talking about that wall the inmates dug a hole through?
:{{d|Melted Cheese Guy}}: Fight!
::{{d|e|Joao raises his arm, and smashes Mr. Corneille. The music abruptly ends, and everyone stares in both silence and shock as Mr. Corneille lets out a muffled, pained groan. An ambulance can be heard in the distance}}
:{{d|gumball}}: {{d|event|Breathes out and smiles awkwardly}} Well, on the plus side, we still get the money to save the school. {{d|event|Gumball continues to stare, this time with a concerned face}}
::{{d|e|Episode ends}}
