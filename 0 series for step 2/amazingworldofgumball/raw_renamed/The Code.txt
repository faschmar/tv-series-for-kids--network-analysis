==Bad Wi-Fi==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin sit in the living room trying to watch a video on their laptop, but it does not seem to load}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Are you guys having problems with the wi-fi as well?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Glitching as he speaks}} I dunno, but I— I've been— been waiting for th— this video to load for ages.

:{{d|Anais}}: What?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry, we're so dependent on the Internet that our brains literally can't function without it.

:{{d|Anais}}: So, do you have a problem with the wi-fi or not?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, I— I— I—

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Come on.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry, I'm just really confused by Dad.

::{{d|event|Richard's fur is painted black. He is wearing a white wig and a revealing set of women's armor}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Hast thou fair imps encountered trouble with the sacred thread of communion?

::{{d|event|The kids look confused for a moment}}

:{{d|Richard}}: I'm in character. I'm a dark elf. I was in the middle of a raid on a dwarf burial ground. So, do you have wi-fi or what?

:{{d|Anais}}: No, the Internet's down.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} I knew this day would come. Kids, there's something I have to tell you.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} You're not my father?!

:{{d|Richard}}: How did you guess?!

::{{d|event|Darwin and Richard chortle}}

:{{d|Richard}}: No. We've just been using Robinson's wi-fi for years.

:{{d|Gumball}}: That would explain why the network is called "Get off my LAN, Watterson."

:{{d|Richard}}: Yeah, well, when he asked me to help him set up his Internet, I kinda grabbed the opportunity to—

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: Mooch off it?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Mr. Dad, how could you?!

:{{d|Richard}}: Easy! You just turn it on, choose a passcode and— Oh. You meant in a moral sense.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Well, Mr. Robinson must've finally got wise and changed the code. No problemo, we'll just get some wi-fi of our own!

:{{d|Richard}}: Excuso little burrito, it's mucho problemo.

::{{d|event|Richard goes in the kitchen to take a can of soda from the fridge}}

:{{d|Richard}}: You see, we got bad credito. Why do you think we have a coin-operated fridge?

::{{d|event|He opens the can and starts drinking, but the soda stops flowing in mid-air. He inserts a coin into a slot on the fridge and the drink splashes all over his face}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What are we gonna do without the Internet?!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wait! I remember something. Something from a time long forgotten. A mystical repository of long lost knowledge, which the ancient people called... {{d|event|Echoing}} a ''bo-oic''.

:{{d|Anais}}: Are you trying to say book?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Exactly! A ''buque''.

::{{d|event|Gumball takes an encyclopedia from a nearby bookshelf. He blows some dust off of it, sits on the couch and places the book on his lap}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Entertain me!

::{{d|event|Naturally, nothing happens. He opens the book, gasps, then starts poking it repeatedly with his finger}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hm. It's not touch-sensitive and it looks like a double keyboard with the letters all messed up.

:{{d|Anais}}: What is wrong with you?! It's like you've only got one neuron left and you're using it for stupidity.

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's because we don't have to retain any knowledge! It's always readily available online.

:{{d|Anais}}: Well I guess you'll just have to take what the Internet does, and do it yourselves.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Hmm...

==Non-Digital Internet==
::{{d|event|Darwin is moving a cardboard frame in front of some pictures taped on the TV, as if scrolling}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude! I think I found a way to reproduce the Elmoreflix experience. Now we can get back to looking at thumbnails for hours without actually watching anything.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well in that case, you may also like...

::{{d|event|Gumball imitates a notification sound and drops a letter into a cardboard box}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What's that?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Your inbox.

::{{d|event|Darwin takes the envelope to examine it more closely}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Ah, cute. It's like the little e-mail icon.

::{{d|event|He opens it and pulls out drawings of Richard}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: "Hey, look who got stuck in a lawnchair!" {{d|event|Laughing}} He had to drive to the hospital to get it removed!

::{{d|event|Darwin gasps and writes something on the paper, then drops it in a box upstairs. He imitates a notification sound. Gumball reads the letter}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: "Did you know that you copied Mr. Dad in your e-mail?" Oh no! How?!

::{{d|event|Gumball flashes back. He is seen writing letters and riding the bus. He places a letter next to his father, who is in a hospital bed with a chair stuck to his backside. The flashback ends}}

::{{d|event|Darwin holds a cardboard frame around his head while making a ringtone sound. Gumball 'picks up.'}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hey, maybe you should just e-mail him to apologize.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Nah, this manual e-mail is way too complicated.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah, much easier to bounce digital messages from server to server between interlinked computers. What about Mr. Dad, though?

::{{d|event|Richard enters their room laughing}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Did you get those pictures of that guy stuck in a lawnchair? {{d|event|Laughs}} What a fool!

::{{d|event|He turns around to leave, revealing a wheelchair stuck to his backside}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: You know what I miss most about the Internet?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Your royal Nigerian penpal?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah, him too. But I meant playing online with other nice kids from all over the world.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are now wearing headphones, pretending to play an online game}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Say cheese, 'cause you're about to get your head shot!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh yeah? Well I hope you like the taste of your own butt, because that's what you're getting handed for dinner!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey, have you ever noticed that if you say, I'm gonna "insert made-up verb" your "insert made-up noun," everything sounds like a really rude alien insult? Like, I'm gonna cybernize your thrusters.

:{{d|Darwin}}: I'm gonna gallifrak your automatron!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm gonna cryptify your proto-eggs with this word!

::{{d|event|The view changes to reveal they are actually playing Scrabble}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Xenopus! It's a type of frog. Scores thirty-two.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Meh, the insults are on point, but the gameplay is boring and the graphics are terrible.

==Real Socializing==
::{{d|event|Larry is walking through the aisle of Food N' Stuff. He notices a sticky note on a carton of eggs}}

:{{d|Larry}}: Huh?

::{{d|event|He takes the note and starts reading it}}

:{{d|Larry}}: "I bought these ping pong balls two months ago, and was shocked when they turned into small chickens. I have to say they don't function as well as the more common ping pong balls, and it's very hard to give backspin to a chicken." What is this?

::{{d|event|Larry keeps walking, only to discover more notes on the shelves. He takes another one}}

:{{d|Larry}}: "Very disappointing. I purchased this ''sledhammer'' to enjoy the snowy slopes of Vermont, and only managed to slide a couple inches. I would not purchase again." WHAT THE HASHTAG, DOLLAR SIGN, AT-SIGN, ASTERISK IS GOING ON HERE?!

:{{d|Gumball}}: "This tank is completely unsuitable for modern warfare. Though the glass panels provide a wide field of vision, I worry my fish'll be exposed to enemy fire."

::{{d|event|Gumball sticks the note onto the fish tank}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, Larry's coming!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Nah, it's fine. The beauty of trolling is that you're anonymous.

::{{d|event|Larry throws them out of the store}}

:{{d|Larry}}: You Wattersons are ''BANNED''! And thank you for shopping at Food N' Stuff.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry. All I have to do is change my IP address.

:{{d|Darwin}}: How?

:{{d|Gumball}}: You reboot your router.

::{{d|event|Gumball picks up a plank from the floor and hits his face with it}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Did it work?

:{{d|Gumball}}: No. I still remember my name.

::{{d|event|He hits his face again, and ends up groaning on the floor}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Maybe we just move on.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin walk into the school cafeteria as the bell rings}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Shouting}} Gumball just checked into the cafeteria!

:{{d|Darwin}}: What are you doing?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Exactly what I do on Elmore Plus.

:{{d|Darwin}}: What, looking at people's pictures and being jealous of their lives?

::{{d|event|Gumball snorts and his butt falls off}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What was that?

:{{d|Gumball}}: LMBO! Laughing my butt off?

:{{d|Darwin}}: You forgot the laughing bit.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Nah, no one really laughs on the Internet. They just go: {{d|event|Snorts}}

::{{d|event|They go sit with Ocho}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Shouting}} I am walking to a table! Hey, look at my food! {{d|event|Shoves his food tray into Ocho's face}} Look at it, you like it?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Puts his face against Ocho's}} You like my face? Hashtag no filter! Come on, gimme a thumbs up.

::{{d|event|They look a Ocho, waiting for a reaction}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, he doesn't have thumbs. I'll try something else.

::{{d|event|Gumball takes spaghetti from a tray and smears it onto his face}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: This boy was diagnosed with a rare condition. One like equals one prayer. Ignore if you don't care about his pain.

::{{d|event|He wipes the food off his face}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hm, maybe he's not online.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Let's poke him!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin poke Ocho repeatedly, until he finally starts talking}}

:{{d|Ocho}}: Look! {{d|event|Sighs}} I don't feel like g—

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, you have to type or we don't know what you're saying.

:{{d|Ocho}}: Look, I— I don't feel like goofing around today. My grandma's really sick.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aww. I like that!

:{{d|Ocho}}: W-what do you mean, you ''like'' it?!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry man, there is no button to express sympathy without having to do all that typing. I mean after all, we're only Elmore Plus friends.

:{{d|Ocho}}: That's it, I'm deleting you from my friends list! ...How do you delete someone in real life?

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} I suggest we run before he works it out.

::{{d|event|They run away}}

==The Cyberspace==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin sit in the front yard of their house. Anais rides up to them on her tricycle}}

:{{d|Anais}}: What are you guys up to?

:{{d|Gumball}}: We're crowdfunding to pay for our own Internet.

:{{d|Anais}}: I think you mean you're begging.

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, it's not begging if you offer perks.

:{{d|Anais}}: What perks?

:{{d|Darwin}}: For one dollar, you get a verbal thank you.

:{{d|Gumball}}: For ten dollars, you get a smile and a warm feeling in your heart.

:{{d|Anais}}: Yeah, that's begging.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|From inside the house}} Anais!

:{{d|Anais}}: We really need that wi-fi back. Dad usually looks online for tips on raising kids, but now he has to improvise.

::{{d|event|Richard opens the door, with a leash in hand}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Mom said I have to take you to the park!

:{{d|Anais}}: You're gonna have to hack Mr. Robinson to get the password.

::{{d|event|Richard retracts the leash, slowly dragging Anais towards him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: How?

:{{d|Anais}}: Ow! I left instructions for you!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Where?

:{{d|Anais}}: Check your BoxDrop!

::{{d|event|Richard and Anais go back inside}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: What's a BoxDro—

::{{d|event|A large cardboard box falls directly onto Gumball}}

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin materialize into the digital world}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What is this place?

:{{d|Gumball}}: This is cyberspace, Darwin. Better switch to incognito mode so the cyberpolice can't trace us.

::{{d|event|A menu appears, allowing them to go incognito, and while walking towards the Robinsons' house they come across what seems to be a floating face}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Who's that?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Probably a fellow hacker. We should greet him in a friendly fashion.

::{{d|event|Gumball kisses both sides of the face and they start walking again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: This is Robinson's house!

::{{d|event|Gumball tries to open the front door, but an error message wipes them. They materialize again}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Access denied?! How do we get in?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Anais says we need to find a backdoor.

::{{d|event|They walk through the backyard and towards the house again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: You gotta hand it to Mr. Robinson, he keeps a tidy desktop.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Look, he left a window open!

::{{d|event|Gumball helps Darwin climb through the window}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Almost there!

::{{d|event|While reaching for the top of the window, Darwin accidentally minimizes it and gets stuck}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Ah! Do something!

::{{d|event|Gumball points a finger at Darwin and laughs}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Do something useful!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, sorry.

::{{d|event|Gumball tries to push Darwin in, to no avail}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Maximize the window!

::{{d|event|Gumball presses the button to maximize the window, but nothing happens. He starts mashing it}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's not working! Oh, hold on.

::{{d|event|The window maximizes and minimizes repeatedly, hitting Darwin's back over and over. When it eventually stops, he glares at Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry, buddy. I should've known that clicking faster never works.

::{{d|event|Clicking noises are heard}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What's that?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} The firewall!

::{{d|event|A flame bursts under Gumball's feet, forcing him to jump through the window and into the house}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Quick! We don't have much time before someone spots us!

:{{d|Darwin}}: What do we do?

:{{d|Gumball}}: We're gonna have to use a Trojan horse.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin walk through the house wearing a horse costume. They have trouble moving, resulting in them breaking a few vases and running into walls}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I have trouble seeing how this will save us from being detected.

::{{d|event|Mrs. Robinson is heard approaching}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} The antivirus!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Where?

::{{d|event|Darwin's arm reaches out of the horse costume}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: There!

::{{d|event|Mrs. Robinson appears as a floating head shooting lasers from her eyes}}

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: Meh meh meh.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Quick, let's hide in one of these folders!

:{{d|Darwin}}: We won't fit!

:{{d|Gumball}}: We can compress our files.

::{{d|event|A menu comes up, compressing them until they fit in the folders. Mrs. Robinson floats past them}}

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: Meh meh.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin extract themselves from the folders, but their appearance is different}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Distorted voice}} I think our f-f-files got c-corrupted!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Distorted voice}} What n-n-n-n-n-now?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hit control-Z!

::{{d|event|They undo until they turn into DNA strands}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|High-pitched voice}} Too far! Control-Y!

::{{d|event|They redo, and manage to recover their appearances}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Normal voice}} Now for Anais' next step. We need to get Mr. Robinson to accept cookies.

::{{d|event|Gumball is stuffing files into a sleeping Mr. Robinson's mouth}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hm, nothing's happening.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Maybe 'cause he's in sleep mode.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Let's try a worm.

==Reclaiming the Internet==
::{{d|event|Gumball takes another file when he is interrupted by Anais, looking in through the window}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Guys! What are you doing?!

::{{d|event|The world returns to its normal, non-digital appearance, showing Gumball has in fact filled Mr. Robinson's mouth with cookies. Darwin holds a bowl of worms}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hacking Mr. Robinson, like you said.

:{{d|Anais}}: I meant hack his computer, not his face. What exactly have you been doing this whole time?

::{{d|event|They flash back to the moment Gumball kissed a floating face, only in the real world it was Hank's butt}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: How do you do, good sir?

::{{d|event|Then, Gumball is seen sliding the window up and down on Darwin's back. The firewall turned out to be the barbecue bursting into flames. Gumball and Darwin were walking through a corridor with their eyes closed, breaking a flower pot on the way}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: The antivirus!

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: Meh.

::{{d|event|Mrs. Robinson is seen as well, revealing the laser-shooting eyes were only a cleaning product she sprayed on a window. Finally, the flashback stops}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah, well you shoulda been more specific.

:{{d|Anais}}: Lemme in.

::{{d|event|Anais takes Mr. Robinsons' laptop and turns it on. It chimes}}

:{{d|Anais}}: That's weird, he never changed his password. Wait a minute, the wi-fi isn't down. He's using all of it up with all these stupid toolbars!

::{{d|event|Mr. Robinson groans slightly}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, fix it then. Quick!

::{{d|event|As Anais removes the toolbars one by one, an alarm clock rings next to Mr. Robinson. Mr. Robinson starts to grumble, almost beginning to wake up}}

:{{d|Anais}}: I need more time!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I got this. All I have to do is hack into the mainframe, adjust the power options, and put it to sleep.

:{{d|Anais}}: What?

::{{d|event|Gumball presses the snooze button. The alarm stops}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Oh, that was less stupid than I thought it was gonna be.

::{{d|event|Mrs. Robinson's voice is heard offscreen as she walks in their direction. Gumball, Darwin, and Anais gasp. Thanks to Anais deleting all of the toolbars, the wi-fi comes back on and they are able to leave through the window without being seen}}

:{{d|Mrs. Robinson}}: Meh-meh-meh.

::{{d|event|Mrs. Robinson notices nothing. She cleans Mr. Robinson, as he is still sleeping}}

==The Internet Is Back==
::{{d|event|Screen fades to nighttime. Gumball, Darwin and Anais run into their room and sit in front of the computer}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: Yay, the Internet is back!

:{{d|Gumball}}: We can get back to refusing invites from obscure relatives to play lame games on Elmore Plus!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Reposting someone's original content and pretending it's ours!

:{{d|Anais}}: And correcting people's grammar in their Elmore Stream comments!

::{{d|event|They start laughing. Suddenly, all the lights in the house turn off}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Anybody got a quarter for the electric meter?!

::{{d|event|The kids groan in unison, ending the episode}}
