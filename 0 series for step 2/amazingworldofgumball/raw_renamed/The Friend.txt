==Dash for the Cupcakes==
::{{d|event|From the opposite side of the backyard, Gumball and Darwin zero in on some cupcakes on a table; while they run to them, Gumball snags himself on a line, and accidentally pops a balloon, setting of a chain reaction of balloons popping around him and Darwin; the balloons pop like gunfire, and one takes him down; Darwin is taken down afterwards; Gumball regains consciousness, his ears ring}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Muffled}} Darwin! You okay?

::{{d|event|Still with balloons popping like gunshots, Gumball drags Darwin and takes cover behind a chair}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on, buddy. We're almost there!

::{{d|event|An eagle squawks, and Anais slams open the shed's door, soda bottle in hand}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Not so fast, boys! {{d|event|Holds up mint}} I drop this non-branded mint into this unbranded cola, it'll give me enough firepower to blast you through that darn fence.

:{{d|Gumball}}: What'cha gonna do with all that cupcake? There's only one of you, and there`s two of us!

:{{d|Anais}}: They're for my friends only! I don't want you there, eat'n everything and weird'n them out. Just give up, and that'll be the end of it. {{d|event|Raises mint}} Otherwise-

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay okay! Wait.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin raise their hands}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: We surrender. {{d|event|Points somewhere}} Oh look! Your friends are here!

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} Really?!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are seen gobbling up all the cupcakes; suddenly they stop, twitch, and make gruesome faces}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Holding out lemon with powder on it; disgusted}} These aren't cupcakes, they're lemons, and the icing is baking soda.

::{{d|event|Their mouths and eyes explode with foam}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Sinisterly}} The real stuff is in the shed.

::{{d|event|She drops the mint, and shoots her brothers away with a powerful blast of soda}}

==Making a Friend==
::{{d|event|Cuts to the duo crossing their arms, unhappy on the couch}}

:{{d|Richard}}: I know, and my decoy cupcakes were made out of toilet paper. But I kept eating anyway! {{d|event|Plunges mouth with plunger}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: You two need to learn to give your sister more space. {{d|event|A bubble growing from her mouth pops; sad}} Mine were made from soap.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin go back to the backyard}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Quietly}} Okay. We'll just blend in with the crowd, and then go ''straight'' for the cupcakes.

::{{d|event|They both put on pompous expressions, pretend to be part of the "crowd," and walk discreetly to the cupcakes.}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Snootily}}:  Hey Mel!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Snootily}}: Hi!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Always great to see you. {{d|event|Turns to invisible person}} Hey Barbara!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Turns}} Hi!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Kisses invisible person's cheeks}} Looking good. {{d|event|Aside to Darwin}} She had a lot of work done. Jeff my man! {{d|event|Laughs}} Sorry to hear you broke up with Karen. Karen! Love the dress. {{d|event|Whispers}} Call me.

::{{d|event|At the table, they immediately gobble up the cupcakes once again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|With mouth full}} Wait, where is everyone?

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Sad}} I don't know! I prepared everything, and no one came!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Did you invite anyone?

:{{d|Anais}}: Of course not, I have no friends.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Hmm.

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Shrugs}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} You know, you're really clever but… sometimes you're kind of an awkward sausage.

:{{d|Darwin}}: You need friends to have a party.

:{{d|Anais}}: But the whole point of this party was to make friends.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Hmm…

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey, how 'bout we make one up for you...

:{{d|Darwin}}: Like an imaginary friend?!

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Sniffs}} Okay.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on! think hard!

::{{d|event|He and Darwin think so hard their eyes pop out}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on. You, too.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Close your eyes and imagine!

::{{d|event|Anais sighs and joins them in imagining a friend. Then the chimera appears, and they see it and stop imagining}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Shouldn't we be screaming?

:{{d|Anais}}: I was kind of waiting for you.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Let's do it on three, two, one.

::{{d|event|They inhale}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Nah, I think the moment's passed. {{d|event|Walks up to chimera}} Why does he look like that?

:{{d|Anais}}: I guess because we imagined him all together. I didn't think he'd be so… real.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Can it speak? {{d|event|To chimera}} Hello!

:{{d|Anais}}: Did we really make you up?

:{{d|Chimera}}: Uh… yeah.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Excited}} If we can imagine him into life, we can imagine anything!

:{{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: Yeah!

:{{d|Darwin}}: We can imagine money and give it to the poor!

:{{d|Anais}}: We could imagine an extinct species and bring it back to life!

:{{d|Gumball}}: We could imagine I never got caught by mom using her hair-removal cream on my butt! Or we could imagine I never said that.

::{{d|event|They nod, and imagine for a while again}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay! {{d|event|To chimera}} Hi! Nice to meet you! High five!

::{{d|event|The chimera doesn't move, and Gumball motions to his upraised hand; the chimera nudges it with his nose, and scares Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Right. Well, Anais, looks like we found someone as socially awkward as you.

:{{d|Anais}}: Ah! {{d|event|Raises hands up in joy}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Why don't you guys try and be friends? {{d|event|Pushes Anais to chimera}} Go on.

::{{d|event|Anais stands afraid in front of the chimera}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on guys, make an effort. Make eye contact. Come on. Come on!

::{{d|event|Gumball grabs Anais' head, and tries to aim her eyes at the chimera's}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I said eye ''contact'' with him!

::{{d|event|Their eyes stretch, and literally make contact}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hm. That'll have to do. Now let's try a smile. Like this.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin smile really wide; Anais copies them, and the chimera smiles back awkwardly; they continue smiling at each other}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Quietly}} More teeth! We need more teeth!

::{{d|event|The chimera smiles to the point of almost baring his teeth, and Anais gives a full-toothed smile}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uh… good?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Aside to Darwin}} If you wanna make friends with straitjacket. {{d|event|Aloud}} Let's move on to making small talk. Demonstration!

::{{d|event|Cut to the brothers picking food at the table, while Anais and the chimera watch}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh hi. Oh, I love your hair! What's your secret?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Male-pattern hair loss with a sprinkle of stress. So, who do you know here?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, I'm Anais' brother.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Really? Me, too! {{d|event|Quietly}} She's so weird-looking, right?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Quietly}} Yeah. She's like a garden gnome who got her head transplanted from an Easter island statue.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Laughs}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: We both like to have fun at the detriment of others!

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Dancing}} We should totally be friends!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Alright, your turn.

:{{d|Anais}}: Uh.

:{{d|Chimera}}: Uh…

:{{d|Gumball}}: Come on. Say something.

:{{d|Chimera}}: Uh. I like... hair?

::{{d|event|Gumball sighs in disbelief}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Uh, here. {{d|event|Rips off Gumball's hair}} Have some!

::{{d|event|Gumball winces, and the chimera eats his hair}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Nervously}} Hm. Yeah.

:{{d|Chimera}}: Oh uh… you have some hair too.

::{{d|event|He tries to pull out some of his, but ends up pulling his head out}}

:{{d|Chimera}}: Oh uh… {{d|event|Offers head}} here. {{d|event|Drops head}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I'm pretty sure that's not how you make friends. Put it back on.

:{{d|Chimera}}: {{d|event|Puts head back}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, you weirdos just say hi, and shake hands.

:{{d|Anais}}: Hello.

:{{d|Chimera}}: Hi.

::{{d|event|Anais shakes his hand, then his hand falls off}}

:{{d|Chimera}}: Oh man! I'm so sorry.

:{{d|Anais}}: No no, wait!

::{{d|event|His hand hides behind his leg, then peeks}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Don't worry. It's okay.

::{{d|event|The chimera smiles, and tickles Anais with his detached hand}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Laughs}} Stop, it tickles!

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's hard to know how to feel about this. On one hand it's "awwww." But n the other hand, it's {{d|event|Retches}}

:{{d|Anais}}: It doesn't matter. I made a friend.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Which means it's time to PARTY!

==A Criminal?==

::{{d|event|Inside the house, Nicole and Richard watch some news; the kids are heard cheering in the background}}

:{{d|News Anchor (TV)}}: Elmore residents are reporting a series of break-ins across the neighborhood with-

:{{d|Richard}}: Hey kids! You alright?

:{{d|Anais}}: Yeah! We're just playing with our imaginary friend.

:{{d|Richard}}: Well, you better leave me some cupcakes.

:{{d|Anais}}: Don't worry, he only eats hair.

:{{d|Richard}}: Well you better leave me some of that too. I've been saving a space in my stomach right here. {{d|event|Pushes spot on tummy, submarine sandwich comes out}} {{d|event|Pushes back sandwich}} I mean right here. {{d|event|Pushes tummy, whole chicken comes out}} {{d|event|Pushes back chicken}} I mean- oh, you know what I mean.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Sh! This looks important.

:{{d|News Anchor (TV)}}: …who is said to be over seven feet tall.

::{{d|event|Scene cuts back to the backyard.}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Now just hold still. {{d|event|Blindfolds chimera}} Good. Okay, and go!

::{{d|event|With just a tap, the chimera unintentionally sends their piñata flying up into the sky until it becomes a star in the sky and disappears.}}

:{{d|Chimera}}: Hm? {{d|event|Takes off blindfold}} Aw sorry.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Nah, it's okay. No harm dooo-

::{{d|event|His hand is missing, and he screams; everyone else screams until Gumball reveals his hand hidden by his long sleeves; everyone sighs in relief, then Gumball hides his hand again and screams; Everyone screams for fun this time, and laughs after Gumball reveals his hand again}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Come on. Let's go inside and make another piñata. I'm sure the last one made some kids in the south pole very happy.

::{{d|event|Scene cuts back to Nicole and Richard}}

:{{d|News Anchor (TV)}}: And now an update on the terrifying intruder who is breaking in to Elmore homes. Here is a police sketch based on eyewitness reports.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Um, guys, I think it would be better if you played inside today. There's a-

::{{d|event|Nicole sees her kids with the chimera; she looks back to the TV, and sees that the chimera is the intruder; everyone gasps and holds their faces with Richard pushing back a pizza coming out of his mouth}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oooh my gosh! There's a criminal in ''my'' house! Stay away from my kids! Richard, call the police! AHHHH!!! {{d|event|Runs around, flailing arms}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Dials phone}} Hello police, I don't know why I'm screaming. But we really need some help right now! {{d|event|Runs around, flailing arms}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Let's all run out of the house with our arms flailing!

::{{d|event|She opens the door, and lets her parents run outside}}

:{{d|Anais}}: I'm sure if we give them a minute, everything will calm down.

==Police Standoff==
::{{d|event|The scene switches to a group of police cars and officers surrounding the front yard of the Watterson's house, with police helicopters flying nearby; Richard restrains his wife, while the Doughnut Sheriff watches her try to struggle free}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Let me in there! '''Let me in there!'''

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Sorry ma'am, but this is a police matter. We're professionals, you can trust us. {{d|event|Looks through manual}} Okay, let me see… police negotiations. "Police." Is that one word, or two? You know how some people say "pow-lis?"

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Grabs megaphone}} RELEASE MY BABIES, OR I'M SENDING IN THE SPECIAL TACTICAL FORCES-

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Hey, give me that! I'm the one with the manual! {{d|event|Through megaphone}} Release my tactical forces, or I'm sending in my special babies!

::{{d|event|From inside the house, Gumball and Darwin glare at the chimera}}

:{{d|Chimera}}: Aw, I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

:{{d|Anais}}: Why did you pretend to be our imaginary friend?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yeah. You better have a good story, man!

:{{d|Chimera}}: Uh… {{d|event|Sees Anais' pleading face}} oh okay. I was made by an old lonely toy maker. We were the best of friends until the day he didn't wake up. I wandered the streets, then to people's homes hoping to find a friend. Everyone was so scared of me, and chased me away. Everyone… except you guys.

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin continue glaring at him, with their arms crossed while heavy streams of tears rush from their eyes}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, that was pretty good.

::{{d|event|He and his brother wipe their eyes}}

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: {{d|event|Megaphone}} You have 2 minutes to comply, or we're coming in!

:{{d|Darwin}}: What're we gonna do!?

:{{d|Anais}}: Whatever it takes to protect our friend.

::{{d|event|Cuts to them in the living room with rolls of shrink-wrap; Darwin plays some action music}}

:{{d|Anais}}: What're you doing?

:{{d|Darwin}}: I'm setting the mood.

:{{d|Anais}}: For what?

:{{d|Darwin}}: The bit where we make the traps.

:{{d|Anais}}: We've only got 2 minutes. Faster! {{d|event|Speeds up the music}}

::{{d|event|They quickly set up traps, with some involving putting shrink wrap in place of the window, putting a sprinkler in the backyard, and a pail of water atop a slightly ajar door; Then Anais stops the music}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Alright, I think we're ready! Everyone in their posts.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Fast and high-pitched}} Okay!

::{{d|event|He runs upstairs, full of energy and hits the wall; then he gets up and continues running in place}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry, I was in the zone. WHOO!

==Raiding the House==
:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Okay, on my mark-!

:{{d|Nicole}}: CHARGE!

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Hey, I'm the officer in charge here.

:{{d|Richard}}: Didn't you hear her? She said ''CHARGE!''

::{{d|event|Police officers charge to the house, The soda cop pulls the door knob, activates a trap, and gets squished by a washing machine; in the backyard, french fry cops try to go through the backdoor, but become soggy when a sprinkler is activated}}

:{{d|French Fry Cop}}: It's a ''mash''acre!

::{{d|event|Back in the front porch, the coffee cop sees a rake in the house}}

:{{d|Coffee Cop}}: Not falling for that trick.

::{{d|event|He jumps through the window, but instead gets wrapped in shrink-wrap; the wrap causes him to fall on the rake, puncturing his bottom, and causing the coffee in him to spill; Earl comes through the door, and goes up the stairs; Gumball then activates the attic ladder trap which slices Earl up; In the kitchen, the hamburger cop spots the pail near the top of the slightly ajar door}}

:{{d|Hamburger Cop}}: {{d|event|Laughs}} You got me, eh?

::{{d|event|Then he sees it activate another trap, which sends a boot to his face that knocks his head/top bun off; the Doughnut Sheriff comes in, and gasps when he sees his badly hurt officers}}

:{{d|Hamburger Cop}}: Careful! The guy's a monster.

::{{d|event|The sheriff walks to a door, and tries to grab the greasy knob}}

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Son of a gun, he buttered the doorknob! This guy must be a criminal mastermind. I need to consult the manual. {{d|event|Reads}} "If the situation requires tact and intellectual effort, call someone else." Oh. {{d|event|Flees}}

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: {{d|event|Megaphone}} You've got 30 seconds to get out, or I'm sending in your mother!

:{{d|Anais}}: Okay, there's a very slim chance of any of us surviving that. Put your heads together, and come up with a plan!

::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin bump heads}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I got nothing.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Me neither.

:{{d|Anais}}: Oh, come on guys! We've gotta think of something. They'll never believe he's innocent, and they won't leave him alone for as long as he lives.

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: {{d|event|Megaphone}} STOP RIGHT THERE! Put the soda down, and your hands in the air!

::{{d|event|The chimera is seen out of the house, chugging down a bottle of soda}}

:{{d|Chimera}}: I took big bottles of unbranded cola, and I got a whole tube of unbranded mints. So please, just let me go, or else... {{d|event|Slowly motions to eat mints}}

:{{d|Hamburger Cop}}: Sir, put the mints down!

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Hold on! {{d|event|Reads}} "In case of sensitive situation"-- FIRE!
:
:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, and {{d|Anais}}: {{d|e|In slow motion}} '''''NOOOOOOOOOO!!!'''''

::{{d|event|All the police officers fire their tasers at the chimera; one of the taser's ends hit the chimera's hands, and this makes him drop the mints into his mouth; he explodes}}

:{{d|Doughnut Sheriff}}: Uh.. wait a minute. No. It says "F.I.R.E: '''F'''ind the problem, '''I'''nitiate a dialogue, '''R'''eason with the aggressor, and '''E'''vacuate the area." Oops.

==Saying Goodbye to a Friend==
::{{d|event|In the bedroom, a sad Anais stares out into the night; then suddenly, the parts of the chimera come together, and reassemble; Anais sees this, and gasps in amazement; The chimera completely reassembles himself in front of her view}}

:{{d|Anais}}: You're alive!

:{{d|Chimera}}: I just wanted to say thank you… and goodbye.

:{{d|Anais}}: But you will come back and visit, right?

:{{d|Chimera}}: I promise.

:{{d|Anais}}: High five.

::{{d|event|She high fives his nose, then watches him leave; he turns around and smiles, and she smiles back; then once again, he continues walking along the road; episode ends}}
