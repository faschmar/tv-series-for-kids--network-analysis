==Back to Pre-School==
::{{d|event|The episode opens at the Elmore Junior High School. It is early in the morning, and classes have yet to start. Yawning, Principal Brown enters the teacher's lounge and flips the light switch. He screams, scattering the stack of papers he is carrying, as his fur stands on end. On the other side of the room, Miss Simian is shown displaying an unsettling grin}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Lucy, what's wrong with your face?!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: I'm smiling, isn't it obvious?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: No, it looks like you're trying to eat your own chin.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Adjusts her mouth}} How about this?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Uhh...

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Tries again, with frightening results}} This?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: {{d|event|Recoils}} Ugh!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Hmm. I just lack practice.

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Why are you trying to smile anyway?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Sneering}} I found it.

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: {{d|event|Panicky}} Ah, let's not jump to conclusions. It could be ''any'' Principal Brown on that FBI warrant. It's a common name.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Baffled}} Hmm?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Oh, um... Listen, I'm not a furry. I just wanted to know what I'd look like with a tail.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: What?! What else have you been hiding?

::{{d|event|The hair on the back of his head parts, revealing a pale, humanoid face}}

:{{d|Face}}: {{d|event|Whispering}} She knows! Finish her now before she tells all the others!

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: {{d|event|Covers it up again}} Uh, no, that's it. {{d|event|Nervous}} So what is it that you found, exactly?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: What is the one thing that would improve the quality of life of everyone in this school by a thousand percent?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: {{d|event|Excited}} Money?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Better.

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: More money?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Even better.

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} Real food in the vending machines?!

::{{d|event|The screen turns to an empty vending machine with sheets of paper on it that have images of food on them}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: No! Even better! I was looking through Gumball Watterson's records, and he failed a test in kindergarten. His grade point average is void! {{d|event|Laughs}} I knew I was right to give up on him early. Let's celebrate! {{d|event|Shimmies to upbeat music}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Um, what is that?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Dancing.

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Hmm. Looks like you're trying to shake out a tapeworm.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Come on, join in!

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: {{d|event|Shrugs; Wiggles his body}} See, this is how you do it. Mmm-hmm. Work it.

::{{d|event|The school bell rings. Gumball is seated at a desk in his classroom, reading a textbook. Unbeknownst to him, the entire desk, himself included, is carried from the room and into the hallway. Upon arriving outside, he becomes aware of his surroundings just before Miss Simian dumps him face-first onto the sidewalk}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Gah! What the what?! What did ''I'' do wrong?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Shows him the test paper}} Look at this question on the test you did seven years ago. "I go to the store and buy ten hotdogs, nine burgers, three bags of chips, and six sodas. If I eat nine hot dogs, seven burgers, three bags of chips, and drink five sodas, what do I have?" You answered, "No self-control." ''That'' was not the correct answer. Which means your GPA is one point short. Do you know what that means?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh, Gumball's Peruvian antelope?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: What?! No! It's grade point average, and it means you're going back to kindergarten.

:{{d|event|Miss Simian grins as Gumball gets shocked}}

==First Déjà Vu==
::{{d|event|Nicole pulls up outside the kindergarten in her car. Apprehensive, Gumball exits the vehicle and closes the door}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Well, have a great... second, first day at school, honey. {{d|event|Drives away}}

::{{d|event|Gumball sighs, covering his face with his hands. When he lowers them, he is greeted by unfettered chaos in the form of toddlers. In unison, they notice his presence, the all-too-brief hush that follows signaling both the beginning and end of his respite. Against a backdrop of perpetual screaming, there is little he can do save weather the onslaught. Ears and fur tugged mercilessly, forcibly fed play-doh and toilet paper, covered in glue, glitter, and even food. He suffers through it all. At the end of the nightmare, he makes it home to his family, confiding in them while they are gathered by the dinner table}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Traumatized}} They just waddle around with their pants down, grabbing everything they see and putting it in their mouths, even if it's a part of your anatomy. They get into fights for no reason and end up crying and hugging. Then they just go on slurring unintelligible nonsense, until they pass out wherever they feel like it. They're like... They're like...British tourists.

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Irritated}} All I'm hearing, is that not only do you not have homework, but while we were stuck in lessons, today you got to play with toys, took two naps, and won good-boy points whenever you made it to the bathroom on time!

:{{d|Gumball}}: What are you trying to say?

:{{d|Anais}}: Stop going on about how good your day was.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} You're right.

:{{d|Anais}}: Thank you, finally!

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, I mean you're right. My day was awesome! I just need to get rid of my inhibitions.

::{{d|event|Next day at kindergarten, Gumball is seated on the floor with several of the kids. Straining, he reaches into the side of his head and plucks out what appears to be a small piece of his brain. As he tosses it on the floor, his face adopts an innocent, child-like appearance}}

:{{d|Octopus Kid}}: Eww. What's that?

:{{d|Gumball}}: My inhibitions.

:{{d|Octopus Kid}}: Your what?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, allow me to explain.

::{{d|event|Gumball demonstrates by waving his arms, spouting gibberish, and drawing on his face with a crayon. He then removes his pants, puts them over his head, and runs into a bookshelf. The kids cheer, and begin to emulate his behavior}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|On the children's potty}} Hey dude, got some TP?

::{{d|event|Kayvon’s hand emerges from the next stall and sticks a roll into his mouth}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Muffled}} Thanks.

::{{d|event|Next, he is by an easel and in the process of painting something}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: A little over there. Hmm. It needs more yellow. {{d|event|Dabs his brush onto the "canvas"}} There.

::{{d|event|Charlie-Ann, now multi-hued from head to toe, squeals happily. Out at the playground, Gumball slam-dunks a basketball into a net only a few feet off the ground, and celebrates with the other youngsters}}

==When Apes Cry==
::{{d|event|Meanwhile, at the junior high, Miss Simian opens the door to Principal Brown's office. She finds him at his desk, weeping in front of a laptop. His fur is drenched in tears}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Nigel, what's wrong?! You look like a biscuit that's been dunked.

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: I've been crying.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Why?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: I watched this video of an orangutan saving a baby bird from drowning.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Why?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: To remind myself that apes are not just terrifying creatures that bite people's fingers off when they lose it. {{d|event|Holds his arms up in self-defense}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Suspicious}} Why?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: {{d|event|Shakes dry, shudders}} Okay, right now I'm talking to you as Nigel Brown, your kind, supportive partner. The man you've loved for years who would never hurt you, and a man you would never hurt.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Aggressive}} Go on.

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: {{d|event|Flinches; Speaks quickly}} But that man is also the school principal, and it's his duty to inform you that by putting Gumball in kindergarten, you're one student short of the school board's targets and if he's not back in your class by Friday, you're fired!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Gently grabs hold of his hands}} Hmm. I understand

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Really? That's so sweet of you—

::{{d|event|He screams as she tightens her grip and starts gnawing on his fingers. Back at the preschool, Gumball is lying on the floor, surrounded by toddlers, during naptime}}

:{{d|Timmy (Kindergartener)}}: Gumball, why is air invisible?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Because scientists thought it was too ugly to look at, and no one would want to breathe it in.

:{{d|Octopus Kid}}: Gumball, where do clouds come from?

:{{d|Gumball}}: From bird flatulence.

:{{d|Polly}}: Gumball, where does rain come from?

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's the moon's eyes watering from all the bird flatulence.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} Psst!

::{{d|event|Gumball sits up as Miss Simian opens the front door, then approaches her}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ugh, what do you want?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Shh! They'll hear.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Meh, maybe. But as long as we use words with multiple syllables, there's no way they'll understand. {{d|event|Crosses his arms; resentful}} What is it anyway? You've already demoted me to kindergarten. Where next, my mom's belly?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Do you wanna get back to your old class?

:{{d|Gumball}}: No way, I love it here! Everyone looks up to me. I mean, mainly 'cause of the height difference, but it's still a good feeling.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Taken aback}} Huh? How can you enjoy it here?

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's a world of scheduled nap times, optional pants, and food you don't need to chew.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: You just described a retirement home.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Exactly! I get to retire without ever having a job! {{d|event|Content}} Ahh, I love this place.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Okay, I gotta level with ya. If you don't come back, I'm fired.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} As if I needed more reasons to stay here!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Huh? {{d|event|Closes her eyes; Her lips pucker as she forces a whimper}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: W-What are you doing? It's weird.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: I'm crying.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Grossed out}} It looks like you're trying to lay an egg with your face. Please stop.

::{{d|event|Her face contorts into other unnerving expressions}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Stop it! Okay fine, I'll come back!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Ah, thank you.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Please! I said I'd come back!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: I'm not doing anything.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ohh, that's your normal face, isn't it?

==Teaching Cheating==
::{{d|event|Miss Simian and Gumball travel to the school library}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: The only problem is you need to pass a test in order to prove you belong in my class. So, you're gonna have to study like you've never studied before.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Let's go!

::{{d|event|Rock music plays in the background while Gumball collects different textbooks}}

:{{d|Lyrics}}: Gotta think big, think deep. Pretty soon you'll make that quantum leap.

::{{d|event|The song ends abruptly, and he stares blankly at a grade eight math book}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: So?

:{{d|Gumball}}: What do I do? I've literally never studied before.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Are you kidding me?! All these years of teaching you? Just go to your mind palace or whatever, and try to remember how to study.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, I'll try.

::{{d|event|As he delves into his mind, the room around him fades to black. After a short struggle, his entire body is compressed into a small rectangular block}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Hmm. More like a mind cupboard. Okay Watterson, time to roll up your sleeves.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Annoyed}} What, more work?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: No, roll up your sleeves so I can write the answers on your arm.

:{{d|Gumball}}: But that's cheating!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Yeah, but if you rearrange the letters in the word teaching, what do ya get?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uhh, eting... cha? 

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: What? No! Cheating.

:{{d|Gumball}}: But isn't that wrong?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Only if you get caught. Look, when I was your age, I cheated too.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Shocked}} What the what right now?!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Places a history book with a photo of cave paintings on the table}} I scribbled the answers on the cave wall.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ohh, so ''that's'' what cave paintings are. Okay, what's the best way for me to cheat?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: In your case? Every way.

==Dishonor Student==
::{{d|event|Gumball is sitting at a desk in a barren classroom. Principal Brown hands him an exam paper}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Right, Watterson. You have one hour. {{d|event|Parks himself at the teacher's desk}} Begin.

::{{d|event|Outside, Miss Simian climbs a ladder that she leans against the window. Her and Gumball exchange a thumbs-up}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Okay, plan A.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mm-hm. {{d|event|Stretches his tongue to see the notes written on it}} Uh... I can't read it.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Why?

:{{d|Gumball}}: It's all backwards. I wrote it in front of a mirror.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Groans}} Okay, plan B.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Shuts his eyes}} Oh no! It goes dark when I close my eyes.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Just pull on them!

::{{d|event|Yanking on his upper eyelids, he studies their interior}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Spots Principal Brown approaching}} Watch out!

::{{d|event|She ducks below the window as Gumball releases his eyelids, causing them to snap into place}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: What is going on here? {{d|event|Peers at the ink imprinted on Gumball's corneas}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Just, uh... visualizing my answers?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Oh. I've always wondered what that would look like from the outside. Carry on.

::{{d|event|He returns to his desk, and Miss Simian comes back up}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Plan C then.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mm-hm.

::{{d|event|Tied to one of Gumball's teeth, is a string that leads down his throat. He tugs on it, and his lower body folds up like an accordion}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Huh?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Pull harder!

::{{d|event|He does as asked, and some of his innards fly toward Principal Brown. When they splatter against the blackboard behind him, he briefly glances up from his magazine}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Hmm? {{d|event|Shrugs}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Worried}} I hope that organ wasn't a vital one.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Next plan.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Raises his hand}} Uh, sir?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Yes?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Can I use the bathroom?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Mm.

::{{d|event|Gumball leaves for a little while, then goes back to his desk}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: So, did you use the notes we left in there?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yep.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Ah, good.

:{{d|Gumball}}: But I have to say, I prefer two-ply paper. It's softer.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: What the?! Okay, next plan. Use the water bottle.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh yeah, thanks! {{d|event|Guzzles the water}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: I meant the label, read the label!

:{{d|Gumball}}: "Recycle after use." Oh, of course. {{d|event|Throws the bottle into the bin}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Riled}} The answers were written ''inside'' the label! What is wrong with you?! {{d|event|Produces a cheat sheet}} Use these!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Squints}} I can't read that.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Don't worry, I've got ''this''.

::{{d|event|Miss Simian lifts a magnifying glass up in direct sunlight, inadvertently igniting the paper}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Yelps; Drops both items}} Never mind! I'll write the answers on the window.

::{{d|event|She tries to fog up the glass with her breath, but it is not very effective}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Dagnabbit, it's too hot outside. {{d|event|Faints; Falls off the ladder}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Watterson, you have five minutes remaining.

::{{d|event|Gumball gasps and Miss Simian reappears outside}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: I'll just mime it. First answer, the birth of Venus.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Realizes that she is nude; Gags and shields his eyes}} That's not really necessary! I ''can'' hear you!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Good point. Question two—

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh, we don't have time for this! I'm gonna do it myself! {{d|event|Backs up, blindly feeling for the cord to the window shade}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: What? No, you can't! You're only one IQ point away from being a vegetable!

::{{d|event|He lowers the blinds, then sits down again}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Question three, question three!

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Okay, here we go.

==Passing Muster==
::{{d|event|The exam finally over, Gumball and Miss Simian are waiting anxiously outside the classroom. Before long, Principal Brown exits the room with a stern expression}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Okay, Watterson, I've marked your test, and I've got some bad news.

::{{d|event|Gumball takes the test paper and gasps}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: I'll see you back in eighth grade tomorrow.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Shows it to Miss Simian}} Look!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Surprised}} You got an A-plus? But how?!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Must've been all the time we spent going over it.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Wait, so you actually—

:{{d|Gumball}}: Yes, I actually learned something.

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: And a pleasure to keep you with us too, Miss Simian.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Ah, good job, Watterson. I guess you didn't need me after all to help you chea... oose your pen for the test. {{d|event|Coughs}}

::{{d|event|Principal Brown glares at them suspiciously}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Nervous}} Yeah, it really helped. It meant I could focus and didn't need to cheat like you did in the eighth grade.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Ah!

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Hmm...

::{{d|event|Gumball facepalms. Cut to the next day. The school bell rings, and Gumball is once more in his old class. Working on an assignment, he looks over to his left and catches Miss Simian trying to copy from him. He covers up his paper, and she turns away, sighing unhappily. The episode ends}}
