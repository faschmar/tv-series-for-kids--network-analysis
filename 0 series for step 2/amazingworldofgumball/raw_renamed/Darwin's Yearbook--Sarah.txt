{{Stub}}{{d|Sarah}}: Ah.

{{d|Gumball}}: Sarah, please just stop.

{{d|Sarah}}: Just read it.

{{d|Gumball}}: I'm so glad you guys are still friends despite fighting for my affections?

{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin look at her}}

{{d|Sarah}}: What? It's fanfiction. There's got to be a bit of shipping. Aah what a pleasant evening in the park.

{{d|Onix}}: ROOOOAR

{{d|Gumball}}: ONIX!!! I should have known!...

{{d|Darwin}}: Don't worry Laserheart. I got this!!! AHH!

::{{d|event|The Smooch attempts to charge Onyx, but ends up getting beaten up}}

{{d|Gumball}}: THE SMOOCH!!!

{{d|Onix}}: Now. For the girl!!!

{{d|Sarah}}: There! If I looked any hotter I'd melt. ( laughs)

{{d|Darwin}}: I guess. Wait, what does "rotflagbotlidsomfwitpoae" mean?

{{d|Sarah}}: Rolling on the floor laughing and getting bits of the lunch I dropped stuck on my face which I then pick off and eat.

{{d|Darwin}}: Right. Do you use that a lot?

{{d|Sarah}}: More than you think actually.

{{d|Darwin}}: Anyway I'm not sure that the comic book Sarah is right for the yearbook. How about just being yourself?

{{d|Sarah}}: With or without lunch on my face?

{{d|Darwin}}: Without.

{{d|Sarah}}: Hmm, narrows it down... Oh, how about when we all raced to the mall?

{{d|e|Scene plays}}

{{d|Darwin}}: That seemed legit that time but now it looks really harsh.

{{d|Sarah}}: Hmm, what else then? Oh! The time you and Gumball went nuts in a police car.

{{d|e|Scene plays}}

{{d|e|Scene pauses}}

{{d|Darwin}}: Wait, how are you remembering this? You weren't there.

{{d|Sarah}}: Yes, I was.

{{d|e|Scene plays again}}

{{d|Sarah}}: That's me!

{{d|Darwin}}: No, you look too frightened there.

{{d|Sarah}}: Oh, then how about when I look frighten''ing?''

{{d|e|Scene plays}}

{{d|Darwin}}: That was my dream sequence. How do know what's in my dreams?

{{d|Sarah}}: Because I'm your biggest fan, duh! Oh, the best dream was the one with the cake shoes.

{{d|Darwin}}: And the goat?

{{d|Sarah}}: You got it.

{{d|e|Scene plays}}

{{d|e|Scene pauses}}

{{d|Darwin}}: Wait, you weren't there for this either.

{{d|Sarah}}: Give it a second.

{{d|e|Scene unpauses}}

{{d|Sarah}}: Here I am!

{{d|Darwin}}: Ah, I think this has gotten too complicated. I just need a simple photo of you, looking like you, in focus, not splattered, or scared, or melting, or in costume, or with food on your face.

{{d|Sarah}}: But food is my face.

{{d|Darwin}}: You know what I mean.

{{d|Sarah}}: Okay how about this?

{{d|Darwin}}: Too melty.

{{d|Sarah}}: Okay how about this?

{{d|Darwin}}: Too painted.

{{d|Sarah}}: This one?

{{d|Darwin}}: Too evil.

{{d|Sarah}}: This?

{{d|Darwin}}: Too...happy I guess?

{{d|Sarah}}: How 'bout this?

{{d|Darwin}}: I don't even know what that is, but it's too that.

{{d|Sarah}}: I know... this!

{{d|Darwin}}: Too... actually, that's fine.

{{d|Sarah}}: Arigato.

{{d|Darwin}}: Sayonara! Man, that was way too difficult. Wait, hang on... I just have to blur it out a bit. Bit more. Bit more. I'll just have to draw her features back on. {{d|e|Grunting}} Yeah, she'll love it.

{{d|Sarah}}: I do.

{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|e|screams}} How long have you been sitting there?

{{d|Sarah}}: 'Bout an hour.
