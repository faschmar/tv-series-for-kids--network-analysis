==You Can't Take Away Our Son!==
::{{d|event|The episode starts out showing inside Principal Brown's office, as Richard is weeping by the desk}}

:{{d|Richard}}: How can you take Darwin away from us?!

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Well it seems he scored a hundred percent in his aptitude test. This has never happened before, so I had to tell the government.

:{{d|Gumball}}: The government?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Yes, they want to test him out. Study his brain, probe it, dissect it. That kind of thing.

::{{d|event|The scene switches to Darwin with an equation on a chalk board}}

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: {{d|event|Via surveillance camera}} Please resolve the following equation using the marker pen provided. 

::{{d|event|Darwin wipes marker ink all over his face}}

::{{d|event|The scene switches back to Elmore Jr. High School}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: It's best they take him away. He'd make the rest of you feel stupid.

:{{d|Richard}}: I guess he's got a point.

:{{d|Anais}}: So, you put clever people in quarantine like they're some sort of contagious pathological disease?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Hmmm... maybe there's more than one genius in this family.

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} What I meant was, ugh... {{d|event|Pulls down her ears and blows a raspberry, then chants "la la la la", and blows another raspberry}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: {{d|event|Wipes his glasses}} Apparently not.

:{{d|Anais}}: Phew!

:{{d|Nicole}}: What makes you think I'll let you take away my son?!

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Well, technically, you're not his parents. He's registered as a... pet fish.

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Worried, then sits back down}} Richard, what are we going to do?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Get a new pet fish?

:{{d|Richard}}: I'll save you, my little fish boy! {{d|event|Runs into a closet}}

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Mr. Watterson, that is a stationary closet.

::{{d|event|Richard walks out of the closet and sits back down sadly}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Can we visit him?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Nooo.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Are you saying we'll never see Darwin again?

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Yup.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Then I'll go with him by proving I am a genius, too!

::{{d|event|Principal Brown, Nicole, Richard and Anais laugh mockingly at Gumball and he walks out of Principal Brown's office}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I need to become intelligent right now! Quick, Gumball! To the liberray! The libararara! The... libarium? Eh, the place where the nerds hangs out.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the school's exterior, where Richard and Nicole are crying}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Cries}} I had so much more love to give.

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Zooms to Darwin photo}} No one will ever be able to replace him.

:{{d|Rocky}}: Hey dudes.

::{{d|event|Darwin's photo descends, revealing Rocky}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Oh, hi Rocky. What's with the suitcase? {{d|event|Sniffs}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Oh, I kinda got rent troubles and I don't wanna stay with parents. Hey. Can I crash at your place? Please. {{d|event|Begs}}

==Library==
::{{d|event|At the school library}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hmm... I gotta find something that will make me smart. {{d|event|Turns}} What do you reckon, Darwin? {{d|event|Remembers Darwin is not around}} Oh, right. {{d|event|A tumbleweed passes by}}

:{{d|Egghead 2}}: Oh look! ''Salsola collina''! More commonly known as Russian thistle, wind-witch, or if you're really stupid, a tumbleweed!

::{{d|event|Both Eggheads laughing}}

:{{d|Colin}}: I love being smart.

:{{d|Gumball}}: That's it! I need a bigger head!

::{{d|event|Gumball start to pump his head with air}}

:{{d|Felix}}: Inconceivable. Mass will always held a special place in my time table.

::{{d|event|Gumball arrives}}

:{{d|Colin}} and {{d|Felix}}: Greetings, fellow crusader of knowledge!

:{{d|Felix}}: What's your favorite subject, hmph?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Unintelligible}}

:{{d|Felix}}: Calculus?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Unintelligible}}

:{{d|Colin}}: Trigonometry?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Unintelligible}}

:{{d|Colin}}: Eh? Eh? Come on, spit it out.

::{{d|event|Gumball bursts and splatters both Eggheads with spit, then slides away}}

:{{d|Colin}}: That guy is such a Gluteus Maximus.

==The Internet==
::{{d|event|Gumball pops up in front of a computer, with Bobert next to him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey Bobert. Whatcha' doing?

:{{d|Bobert}}: I'm on the internet, the largest source of knowledge in the world. Why don't you get connected?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Uses mouse as a telephone}} Uh, hi, hello. Is this the Internet?

:{{d|Bobert}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} You need to click the icon.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Mocks Bobert by imitating him}} Which one is the icon?

:{{d|Bobert}}: Dude, it's the only thing on the screen.

:{{d|Gumball}}: I knew that.

::{{d|event|Gumball clicks Internet icon and the computer shows an endless stream of pop-ups}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wooaaah! {{d|event|Laughs}} This is beautiful! I can feel it! I'm totally learning something-thing-thing-thing...

::{{d|event|Gumball glitches out and a blue screen of death appears, indicating Gumball has "crashed", then disappears as Gumball groggily gets to his feet}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Strained}} What... happened?

:{{d|Bobert}}: Your memory could not cope. You crashed. I had to reboot you.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Annoyed}} Oh come on! There's gotta be something in this library making people smart.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Teri}}

:{{d|Teri}}: This is such a great, ''book''!

:{{d|Leslie}}​: I'd like to borrow this, ''book'', please?

:{{d|Dictionary}} and {{d|Thesaurus}}: {{d|event|Reading each other}} Book book book book, book book book, ahh booook.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ahh that's it, they are all watching books.

==Gumball's Brain==
::{{d|event|Gumball sits between Carmen and Carrie, then he puts out a book and watching it}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispers to Carmen}} Hey.

:{{d|Carmen}}: Shh.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispers}} Hey.

:{{d|Carmen}}: Shhhh.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Whispers}} Hey.

:{{d|Carmen}}: Shhhhhhhh.

:{{d|Gumball}}: I think my book is broken. I've been watching for ages and I'm still not smart.

:{{d|Carmen}}: {{d|event|Facepalms}} You don't watch books. You ''read '' them.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Shh. People are trying to work.

::{{d|event|Carmen leaves the table with her book}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, brain, let's get reading. {{d|event|Inhales}} Once... u-pon... a.. ti-i-i-me--

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: That's it. I'm outta here. {{d|event|Deploys a ladder out of Gumball's ear}} I've had enough. I'm off to watch TV.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey. Where do you think you're going?

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: I didn't sign up for this. I quit.

:{{d|Gumball}}: You can't quit. There's no way I'm gonna pass a test without a brain. Please. I need you.

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: We'll never pass. I'm stupid.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Then— then, I'm going to make you smart, like Darwin!

::{{d|event|Inside the government facility}}

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: Uh, sir? You appear to have a bit... ink on your face?

::{{d|event|Darwin turns around to show his face, covered in ink}}

==The Watterson's House==
:{{d|Nicole}}: Are you sure there's nothing else you want, honey?

:{{d|Richard}}: Ask for anything.

:{{d|Rocky}}: Well, uh, can I have two cans of soda?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Quick, Richard! The fridge!

::{{d|event|Richard quickly runs to the kitchen}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Oh, and some jellybeans. But only the yellow ones!

:{{d|Richard}}: Okay!

::{{d|event|Rocky questions Nicole while he wears green underwear and shoes}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Uh, are you sure there's nothing else to wear, Mrs. Watterson?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Please honey, You can call us "Mom" and "Dad."

==Training==
::{{d|event|Scene cuts to the School Library. Gumball's Brain can be heard crying}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Read it!

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: I can't! {{d|event|Crying}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Read it!

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: It's too difficult! Don't make me!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Aren't you tired of being so useless? Years and years of insults and abuse! Remember...

::{{d|event|Zooms in to Gumball's Brain. Visions of Miss Simian, Banana Joe and Principal Brown appear and insult Gumball's Brain}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Another "F" for you, Pea Brain!

:{{d|Banana Joe}}: {{d|event|Laughs}} Doofus!

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Loser!

::{{d|event|The three of them laugh and disappear}}

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: Okay, I'm ready.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Then prove it.

::{{d|event|Gumball's Brain opens a book and performs a chop, but ends up hurting himself}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: This may take a while.

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: {{d|event|Falls}}

::{{d|event|They perform a song while Gumball's Brain gets stronger}}

:{{d|Man}}: ''I was a feeble minded guy. I'd slip on ice and wonder why.'' 

:''So many obstacles were thrown my way, on a downward slide each and every day.'' 

:''But something popped inside my brain. I got up to fight that fight again.'' 

:''And I knew what to do. I went through the mental pain.'' 

:''You gotta think big, think deep.'' 

:''Pretty soon you'll make that quantum leap.'' 

:''Think big, think smart. Make your brain your finest body part!'' 

:''The greatest minds from yesterday, will be crushed to dust 'cause I'm on my way.''

:''(Big, big, big) You gotta think big!''

::{{d|e|Gumball and his Brain freeze frame while jumping. Idaho walks by, and wonders why they are doing that, but he shrugs it off}}

==What the?==
::{{d|event|Scene cuts inside Principal Brown's office while he's enjoying his coffee, when suddenly Gumball surprises him}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: I want to take the aptitude test!

:{{d|Principal Brown}}: Hmmph! You don't have the brain of the genius, Watterson.

:{{d|Gumball}}: We'll see about that. Come on, brain! Show Principal Brown what you can do.

::{{d|event|Gumball's Brain grabs a desk light and swings it at Principal Brown, knocking him unconscious}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: What the—? What is wrong with you?! I meant do an equation or something.

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: Oh. Sorry.

==Back in the Watterson's House==
::{{d|event|Scene cuts inside Watterson's house with Rocky walking around}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Looks at Gumball's brain}} I always pictured it a little smaller.

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: I've been working out.

::{{d|event|Rocky sits with Anais and Gumball}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Hey, dudes, want some popcorn? {{d|event|Shouts to the kitchen}} Dad, can I borrow Mom's car tonight?

:{{d|Richard}}: Sure, son. Anything you like.

:{{d|Rocky}}: Man, my dad is a righteous dude.

::{{d|event|Gumball notices Rocky's strange attire}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mom? What's going on here?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh. Well, this is your new brother: Rockwin.

:{{d|Rocky}}: 'Sup?

:{{d|Gumball}}: You're kidding, right?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Come on. Let's just all give it a try. Just for a moment. {{d|event|Humming}}

::{{d|event|Brief pause}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Shouts}} It's not working!

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} You're right. It's not.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Interrupts Nicole}} Just a minute. {{d|event|Hums, then stops}} No, it's not working.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Crying}} I miss Darwin so much.

::{{d|event|Everyone starts sighing, except Anais. Then Anais interrupts}}

:{{d|Anais}}: All right! It was me!

:{{d|Gumball}}: What?

:{{d|Anais}}: It was me who filled out Darwin's aptitude test. I found it on the TV guide. I should be the one taken away.

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Nicole}}, {{d|Richard}}, and {{d|Gumball's Brain}}: So Darwin's not a genius?

:{{d|Anais}}: No. ''I'' am.

::{{d|event|Suddenly the doorbell rings. They open the door and see Darwin}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Richard}}, {{d|Nicole}} and {{d|Anais}}: Darwin!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hello!

:{{d|Clipboard Men}}: We believe this, is yours.

::{{d|event|Darwin steps inside the house}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Yay!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Welcome back, buddy!

:{{d|Nicole}}: I missed you so much.

:{{d|Anais}}: Don't ever go away again.

:{{d|Richard}}: What a conveniently happy ending.

==Happy Ending?==
::{{d|event|The door starts to close, but a Clipboard Man prevents the door from closing with his leg}}

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: Not so fast.

::{{d|event|Everyone gasps}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Hey. I said it was a happy ending.

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: You still owe us one genius.

:{{d|Gumball}}: What do you mean?

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: Well, it's obvious ''he'' didn't take that test.

::{{d|event|Darwin gives a stupid look}}

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: But someone in this house did, {{d|event|Rips off the other Clipboard Man's paper, showing a Warrant}} and this warrant says that we get to take that person away.

::{{d|event|Everyone gasps again}}

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: Who is it?

::{{d|event|They begin to get anxious}}

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: Ahem. ''I'' know who it is.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} Be quiet. Don't listen to him. He's insane in the membrane.

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, you don't. You're stupid. We've established that.

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: Let the brain speak.

::{{d|event|A heartbeat sound can be heard as each person's worried face is shown. Then cuts to Rocky drinking soda and creating the heartbeat-like sound}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Burps}} Sorry.

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: The person who took the test was... H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h— him! {{d|event|Points at Rocky}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Huh?

::{{d|event|Everyone surprised}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Me?

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: {{d|event|Winks}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Oh. Yeah, I took that test.

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: Then get your suitcase. You're coming to the research center.

:{{d|Rocky}}: What, you mean like, for free?

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: Well of course.

:{{d|Rocky}}: Eh, definitely beats my parents' place.

::{{d|event|Scene cuts inside the car with Rocky in it}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Oh, and I'm gonna need a hot tub, too. 'Cause I do most of my thinking in the bath.

::{{d|event|The car leaves}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: See ya, Rocky.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Bye, Rocky.

:{{d|Richard}}: Bye.

:{{d|Gumball}}: That was really smart, Brain. Darwin's back home.

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: Can I come home too?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Are you kidding me? Get in there, little dude.

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: Whoo-hoo. {{d|event|Enters Gumball's head}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: High five.

:{{d|Gumball's Brain}}: Ha. {{d|event|High fives Gumball from his ear}}

::{{d|event|Scene changes inside the research facility with Rocky in it}}

:{{d|Rocky}}: Oh, and a pepperoni pizza?

:{{d|Clipboard Man}}: ''Then'' will you solve the equation?

:{{d|Rocky}}: Yeah, yeah. After my pedicure.
