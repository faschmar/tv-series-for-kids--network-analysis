:{{D|Mike}}: {{D|event|To Felicity}} Ma'am, do you find the new speed bumps in your neighborhood a nuisance?

:{{D|Felicity}}: Yes. I believe these ''imported'' speed bumps do not fit the regulation standards.

==Phone Unboxing==
::{{D|event|Scene changes to Tobias in his room}}

:{{D|Tobias}}: Hi, guys, this is my new phone-unboxing video. My old phone told me it needed an update, so I followed its advice, threw it away, and my dad bought me a new one.

==ButterSmear==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to Richard recording himself in his children's room}}

:{{d|Richard}}: I love butter. But "''science''" claims that the body is not designed to consume only butter. Well, man has been known to overcome every obstacle in his existence. We've been on the moon, and proved the Earth is flat, and Albert Einstein brought a guy named Frank back from the grave! So I'll tell you what, real science is not taking no for an answer. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...{{d|event|Holds up a stick of butter on a popsicle stick}} ButterSmear! It's the combined taste of all the essential food groups: Burgers, bacon, sausages, fries, bacon, burritos, curries, bacon, bacon, bacon--all in one healthy yet delicious yellow spread. I've eaten ButterSmear every meal for eleven days now and I feel no ill side effects at all. In fact, I've lost feeling in my entire body. Pledge today to help me push mankind one step further. {{d|event|Eats the ButterSmear}} Mmm...ButterSmear, makes everything taste a little bit butter. {{d|event|Falls face-first onto keyboard. Richard speaks in a muffled voice}} If you're watching this video, please call an ambulance.

Start with squats. It's gonna go fast so just try to follow my moves. {{d|event|As Coach begins counting, the footage becomes squished}} And one...and two...and three...and four. Feel the burn, that's right. Now for some sit-ups. {{d|event|The footage moves along with Coach again, this time falling back and then pulling up again}} And one...and two...and three...and four. {{d|event|Coach breathes in exhaustion}} Let's keep going. Push-ups. {{d|event|The footage shrinks and begins to bend forward, once again as Coach counts}} And one...and two...now you're working. And three...{{d|event|Grunts}} and four. Well done, everyone. In my next video we'll be into more acrobatic exercises. Here's a little teaser. Backflip. {{d|event|Grunts as the footage does a back-and-forth spin}} This was four steps to get in shape with Coach Russo.

Bad boy. {{d|event|Sausage Dog lifts his leg again}} Hey. {{d|event|Sausage Dog begins to repeatedly lift his leg up and down}} AaaAAAaaahh...heEEey...heeEEEyy...aaAAAHHH. Hey! Hey! Hey! Heeeey! Hey...no! {{d|event|Fire Hydrant tries to blow the dog away}} Go away! {{d|event|Continues blowing}} Fine! You asked for it! {{d|event|Sprays water on the dog. The dog whimpers and runs away.
