==The Last Trophy==
::{{d|event|Rocky is seen polishing some trophies of Miss Simian, when her reflection is seen in the glass. Rocky yelps and drops the trophy}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Dives toward the trophy}} Careful, numbskull! These trophies are symbols of my excellence as a teacher. It took me 754 years to collect them all.

::{{d|event|Rocky mumbles}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: What was that?!

:{{d|Rocky}}: Hello! "Favorite teacher award"? It's like the best one and stuff, but you'll never win it.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Why not?

:{{d|Rocky}}: Because you need a letter of recommendation from a student who, uh... actually likes you.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: That sounds easy enough.

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Laughs}} Seriously, though, no one likes you, Miss Simian. Not even me! And I like ''everybody.''

::{{d|event|Rocky runs away}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Nobody likes me? Hmm...

==In Class==
::{{d|event|Miss Simian continues to think even in class as Gumball and Darwin watch her}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, I think something's wrong with Miss Simian.

:{{d|Darwin}}: What makes you say that?

:{{d|Gumball}}: She hasn't told anyone off all day.

::{{d|event|Gumball faces behind. The camera changes views, showing all members of the class causing a massive chaos}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: That ''is'' weird.

::{{d|event|The school bell rings}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Hey, guys! Wait up!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Gumball?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Nervous}} Yeah...?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: You and I are friends, right?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Faces to Miss Simian}} Are we?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Well, what with all the detentions and everything, I guess we spend a lot of time together.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uhh... I guess so. Anyway, gotta go.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Just one more thing. Would you mind if I hang out with you just for a little while?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uh... yeah. Yeah, I would. {{d|event|Walks out of the class}}

==Break Time==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to Gumball and Darwin in the school yard}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Basically, she asked to be my friend. Well, I told her "no," obviously. {{d|event|Camera pans to Miss Simian}} But she's just following me around.

::{{d|event|Scene location changes to the cafeteria, where Gumball, Darwin and Miss Simian having lunch together}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: And the strangest thing is, she's completely unresponsive. Watch. {{d|event|Launches a pea using a spoon into Miss Simian's face, gaining no response from her}} See? Nothing!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hmm. Try something hot.

==Return to Home==
::{{d|event|Gumball and Darwin are on the way to their home, with Miss Simian following them}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|To Darwin, nervously}} Is she still there? {{d|event|Faces behind, camera view changes to Miss Simian}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yep. 

::{{d|event|Darwin starts walking with Gumball for a few steps before turning to Miss Simian again}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!! 

::{{d|event|Brief silence}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Huh?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Grabs a stick and throws it toward Miss Simian}} Fetch!

::{{d|event|Miss Simian acts depressed and does nothing, then they give up}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} I hope things get better tomorrow. {{d|event|Continues walking with Darwin}}

==Unexpected Guest==
::{{d|event|Scene changes in front of the Wattersons' house, from which slurping can be heard. Scene changes inside, with the Wattersons watching Miss Simian drinking milk from a bowl of cereal}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: What is she doing in my house?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Stops}} I'm sorry. I just that maybe we could share a nice breakfast together, but since you all hate me, {{d|event|Stands up}} I'll just go. {{d|event|Approaches the door}} I'm walking.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Sadly}} It's so sad.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: This is me... on my way. I'm at the door... {{d|event|Grabs the door knob}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Sadly}} This is kind of harsh.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: I'm turning the door knob. {{d|event|Turns the knob}} I'm opening the door. {{d|event|Opens the door}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Starts crying}} I don't know why, but I'm crying!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Boy, it sure looks lonely out there. {{d|event|Shuts the door}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Cries}} Mom, why do you hate Miss Simian so much?

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Annoyed}} I don't want to talk about it.

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Crying}} Please, let her stay!

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} Okay. She can stay, but—

::{{d|event|Miss Simian interrupts Nicole from the window}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Oh, thank you! You're such a kind and friendly family! {{d|event|Camera zooms}} You know, {{d|event|Heads down}} I never had friends before. I don't even know what friends do.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't worry. We'll show you.

==Therapy Session==
::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin and Miss Simian are outside of the house}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Now, a very important part of friendship is sharing. Imagine you both have ice creams.

:{{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Miss Simian}}: Oh. {{d|event|Pretend they are holding ice cream}}

::{{d|event|Darwin moves his tongue as if licking ice cream}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: But what's this? Darwin has dropped his ice cream. 

::{{d|event|Gumball waits for Darwin to mimic the ice cream dropping, but Darwin doesn't stop licking}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: I said, "Darwin has dropped his ice cream." 

::{{d|event|He wings his hands over Darwin's hand as he knocks over Darwin's ice cream}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Splat!

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Stops briefly, then looks down}} You got it on my shoes.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Uh, do you want to share mine? {{d|event|Moves her hands as she breaks her ice cream in half}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} Very good.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Ice cream, Darwin? {{d|event|Hands her hand as she gives an ice cream to Darwin}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Aw, thanks! {{d|event|Starts moving his tongue as he licks the ice cream again}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: But, Gumball, ''you'' don't have an ice cream. Want to share mine?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sure! 

::{{d|event|Miss Simian starts licking, then Gumball also starts licking, literally, but then stops licking}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh... {{d|event|Starts licking again}}

::{{d|event|Camera zooms to Gumball's tongue trying to avoid touching Miss Simian's tongue, then he gives up}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dude, {{d|event|Whispering to Darwin}} this is so gross!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Why don't you pretend you have your own ice cream?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Sighs and facepalms}} Ugh! Why didn't ''I'' think of that?

==Hi-Face==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the bench area in a Stadium}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Friends also high-five, like this.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Toss}} High-five!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Okay, now— 

::{{d|event|Miss Simian pushes her hand into Gumball's face}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: No, I mean slap my— 

::{{d|event|Miss Simian repeats the same thing}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Let's move on to the next lesson.

==Dodge or Dare==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the Wattersons' backyard}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: How about we all play game, like friends do? Here's one we made up. It's called...

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Dodge or Dare!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Roll the dice. 

::{{d|event|Miss Simian rolls the dice}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Take a card. 

::{{d|event|Miss Simian takes a card}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: What'd you get?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: "Put a gooey hair ball in Miss Simian's lunch."

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} L-Let me take that. 

::{{d|event|Gumball takes the card that Miss Simian had and hands her a deck of cards, which Miss Simian takes one of them}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: Pick another.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: "When Miss Simian's back is turned—"

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Chuckles}} A-Actually, let me pick one for you. {{d|event|Starts searching for cards}} Uh, cover Simian in slug juice, drop water balloons on Simian, Miss Simian, Miss Simian, Miss Simian— {{d|event|Throws the cards away and giggles}} Heh heh. Forget the cards. Here's a dare: make the most annoying noise possible.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Brief pause, then attempts to scream}} Eeeh...

:{{d|Gumball}}: O... kay. That was... good, but we know that you can do better.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Like when you're mad at us.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Oh, you mean this little thing? ''GUUUUUUUUUMBAAAAAAALL!!!''

::{{d|event|Miss Simian's scream is so loud that it produces ultrasonic residue and makes both Gumball's and Darwin's skin slides back and shows their insides of their mouth}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: That... was... awesome!

:{{d|Gumball}}: High-five! 

::{{d|event|As before, Miss Simian pushes her hands into Gumball and Darwin's faces}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: That still needs a little work.

::{{d|event|View changes to backyard window, with Nicole watching Gumball, Darwin and Miss Simian while doing her dishwashing}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: I've got my eye on you, Simian.

==Family Fun==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the living room of the Wattersons' house where Richard is laughing on the couch}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Ha-ha-ha-ha. Do it again! Do it again! 

::{{d|event|Camera zooms out showing Miss Simian blowing into Richard's stomach again, while Nicole watches the family laughing. Richard falls off the couch, laughing and revealing Darwin standing behind him}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{D|event|Hugging Gumball, Darwin and Anais}} I'm so pleased to finally have such ''great'' friends!

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, {{d|Richard}}, and {{d|Anais}}: Ahhh! We love you, Miss Simian.

::{{d|event|Camera zooms to Nicole}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Sorry, kids. Miss Simian, c-can I have a word with you {{d|event|Angrily}} in private, please?

:{{d|event|View changes to the dining room}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Sits on a dining chair}} Yes, Nicole, how can I help you?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Listen, Simian, you might have the rest of them fooled, but I don't trust you for a second. {{d|event|Lunges forward}} I remember you from school. I remember the horrible name you used to call me everyday. 

::{{d|event|Camera zooms towards Nicole and Miss Simian}} 

:{{d|Nicole}}: Do you remember that?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Regretful}} Yes, I do. And I'm sorry.

::{{d|event|Camera zooms to Nicole}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Surprised}} What?

::{{d|event|Then to Miss Simian}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: I was that horrid person for so long, and look where it got me. No friends, no family, {{d|event|Covers her face}} just bitterness and wrinkles.

::{{d|event|Camera zooms to Nicole who is still surprised and back to Miss Simian again}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Hugging herself}} But even an old ape can change. {{d|event|Points to Nicole}} Will you give me that chance?

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Thinks for a second}} Oh, I don't know. It's all happening so fast.

::{{d|event|Miss Simian rushes forward and hugs Nicole from behind}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Ple-e-e-e-e-ase?

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Shudders}} Okay, I'll-I'll give it another shot.

==The Letter==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to Front of Wattersons' house, then into the living room}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: What do we do now, best friends?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Uh, let's see. I know! Best friends write letters to each other about how great they are. {{d|event|Gives a notepad to Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wow! What a... friendly idea. {{d|event|Takes the notepad}} What shall we write?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Um...ooh... How about "We, the aforementioned, unanimously agree that Miss Simian is worthy of this year's Favorite Teacher Award."

:{{d|Gumball}}: "Favorite Teacher Award." Okay! Done it!

::{{d|event|Miss Simian quickly takes the notepad from Gumball, and laughs maniacally}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: It's mine! {{d|event|Holds the notepad into her chest}}

::{{d|event|Miss Simian dances away in glee as hip-hop music plays}} 

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Ah-a! Ha-mmm! Ah-mmm! Ah-a! Ah-a! Uh-hmm! Uh-mmm! 

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the window}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Look how happy she is.

:{{d|Gumball}}: That's the power of friendship.

==Horrible Memories==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to Elmore Junior High}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wow! You baked that cake for Miss Simian?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Yeah. I think she deserves a second chance. {{d|event|Walking towards Rocky}} Is Miss Simian around?

:{{d|Rocky}}: Nah, dude. She just drove off. You should've seen her, all dancing and laughing, saying she finally got some losers to write her a "Favorite Teacher" nomination.

::{{d|event|The scene goes slow-motion, Nicole gasps and drops the cake, which shatters upon hitting the floor}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|e|Anxiously}} What was the word she used?

:{{d|Rocky}}: {{d|event|Slow-motion}} "Losers."

::{{d|event|Nicole's eyes grow wide and the scene changes to a flashback of her as a baby, falling after a few steps, and her eyes well up with tears}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Unh!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Heh! Nice first steps, loser!

::{{d|event|Nicole, as a kid, falls from a bike that was hitting a rock}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Unh!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Laughs}} Nice cycling, loser!

::{{d|event|Nicole, as a student, sits at her desk as Simian looks at a poem she wrote}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Nice "poem," loser!

::{{d|event|At the school reunion dance, Nicole has permed hair}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Nice hair, loser.

::{{d|event|At Nicole's wedding with Richard, Miss Simian passes by with her car}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Nice husband, loser! {{d|event|Laughs maniacally}}

::{{d|event|End of flashback. Scene returns to the school}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Angrily}} Everyone, get back in the car.

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Eating Nicole's cake off the floor}} Now?

==The Chase==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to Miss Simian driving in her car down the expressway}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Laughing}} Soon the trophy will be mine! 

::{{d|event|Nicole bumps into the rear-end of Miss Simian's car with her own car}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: We'll see about that, you two-faced baboon!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: There's nothing you can do about it, loser!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Mom! What are you doing?!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Something I should have done a long time ago. {{d|event|Presses down on gas pedal}}

::{{d|event|Nicole and Miss Simian's cars bump a few times. Gumball, Anais, and Darwin sway as the car shakes}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Kids, throw stuff at her!

:{{d|Gumball}}: But isn't that dangerous?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Not as dangerous as disobeying your mother!

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin and Anais grab soda cans}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry! Eh! {{d|event|Throws the soda cans outside the window}}

::{{d|event|Miss Simian begins to swerve}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Ah! Oh! Aaah!

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Reaches for candy in the car seat}} Open your mouth.

::{{d|event|Anais loads the candy into Darwin's mouth, and he fires it at Miss Simian like a machine gun. The candy cracks Miss Simian's windshield}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Aah! Ohh!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I hope you like pepperoni! {{d|event|Drops a pizza box on her windshield}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Aaaaaah! 

::{{d|event|Miss Simian's car into the rails and drives tilted for a little while. She notices the recommendation letter about to fly out and grabs it}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: That was close!

::{{d|event|Miss Simian's car tilts back to normal,but she rides off a ramp made of dirt}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Midair}} Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Cool!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Not coo-o-o-o-l! 

::{{d|event|Miss Simian's car lands right side up}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: I thought you were our friend, Miss Simian.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Ha! Who needs friends when you have this letter? {{d|event|Notices the letter isn't in her hand}} Aah! Huh?

::{{d|event|The letter is stuck on Miss Simian's car antenna}}

:{{d|nicole}}: There it is, Richard! Get it!

:{{d|Richard}}: Do what?!

:{{d|nicole}}: I'll get closer, and you'll lean in and grab it.

:{{d|Richard}}: Seriously?

::{{d|event|Nicole gives him a serious look, and Richard rolls down the window}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Reaches out the window}} Little bit closer, honey! Ooh! Almost... there! Aah!

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, and {{d|Anais}}: Dad! 

::{{d|event|Richard holding on to both cars}} 

:{{d|Richard}}: Oooh-whoo! Whoo-oooh!

:{{d|nicole}}: Hold on! {{d|event|Drives closer to Miss Simian}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Waaah-ha! 

::{{d|event|Richard's head falls through Miss Simian's car window}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Hi.

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Bye! {{d|event|Repeatedly slaps Richard in the face with her palm}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Ow! 

::{{d|event|The cars break through the rail as a truck approaches them}}

:{{d|All}}: Aaaaaaaah!

::{{d|event|The two cars separate when the truck goes by. The cars then come closer and Richard is standing on both cars}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Grabs letter}} Got it! Ha ha! Aaaaaah! 

::{{d|event|Richard drops letter, which gets wrapped around the antenna again, when he sees rail}}

::{{d|event|The cars separate and Richard is left running on a car ramp until he goes flying into the air}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Whoooooa! {{d|event|Explodes somewhere off the road in the woods}}

:{{d|nicole}}: {{d|event|Bumping into Miss Simian as she says each word}} Never... trick... my... family... again!

:{{d|Anais}}: Mom, watch out! {{d|event|Nicole swerves}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, and {{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Spinning}} Wooooaaah!

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: {{d|event|Laughs}} Aaah! {{d|event|Smashes through a warning sign}}

::{{d|event|Nicole's car stops}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Panting heavily}} And that, kids, is why you wear seatbelts.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Where's Miss Simian?

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Uh... huh... ah... ah-hey!

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Miss Simian trying to reach the letter on her windshield, and her car tipping over the ledge}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Miss Simian, no! 

::{{d|event|Miss Simian looks towards Gumball}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: You could still be friends with us if you like.

::{{d|event|Miss Simian glances at the letter, then glances at Gumball, Darwin, and Anais}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: Nah! {{d|event|Grabs the letter, and the car falls of the ledge}} Aaaaaaaaaah!

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Nicole look over the ledge as a crash and explosion are heard}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Ohhh.

:{{d|Richard}}: What did I miss?

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, and {{d|Anais}}: Dad!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh, just Simian taking a little tumble.

:{{d|Richard}}: Maybe that'll teach her for "monkeying around."

:{{d|All}}: {{d|event|Laugh}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: We shouldn't laugh. She may be seriously hurt.

:{{d|Richard}}: Well, you shouldn't have "gibbon" her a second chance.

:{{d|All}}: {{d|event|Laugh}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: No, really. That's enough.

:{{d|Richard}}: Well, she shouldn't have "orangu-tangled" with us.

:{{d|All}}: {{d|event|Laugh}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: I said that's enough.

==So Worth it==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to Miss Simian (bandaged and in a wheelchair) putting a trophy on her shelf in school}}

:{{d|Miss Simian}}: That was so worth it.
