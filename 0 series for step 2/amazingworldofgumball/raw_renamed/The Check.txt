==The Morning Surprise==

::{{d|event|The episode starts with the kids in their room. Everyone is sleeping peacefully when Louie suddenly comes in}}

:{{d|Louie}}: Breakfast!

::{{d|event|Everyone abruptly wakes up screaming, then fall back asleep. Louie comes in again}}

:{{d|Louie}}: Breakfast!

::{{d|event|Everyone wakes up screaming again, only to go back to sleep. Louie comes in a third time}}

:{{d|Louie}}: Break- 

::{{d|event|Gumball interrupts Louie. He tries to put his foot over Louie's mouth}} 

:{{d|Louie}}: Sorry, kids. I don't have a snooze button. Come on down, now.

::{{d|event|Louie pulls Gumball out of bed. Gumball grabs Anais, who in turn grabs Darwin. Everyone is then being dragged downstairs by Louie}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Moaning voice}} Why?

:{{d|Louie}}: Because as your new old grandpa, I wanna spend some quality time with ya!

:{{d|Anais}}: I call being asleep quality time.

:{{d|Darwin}}: And no offense, Grandpa Louie, but I don't trust old people's taste in food!

::{{d|event|A flashback starts. Cut to a view of a fish on a plate}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|bleh}} What is that?

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: It's herring surprise.

:{{d|Gumball}}: What's the surprise?

::{{d|event|The fish looks at Gumball and says "boo." After this, the flashback ends and cuts to the kids still being dragged}}

:{{d|Louie}}: Come on, it will be fun!

:{{d|Anais}}: No offense, but we don't trust old people's taste in fun, either.

::{{d|event|Another flashback starts. Cut to the kids and Granny Jojo sitting on the couch. Granny Jojo has a crossword in her hand}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} Cruiseship! {{d|event|Writes "cruiseship" in her crossword}} WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

::{{d|event|The flashback ends. Cut to Louie dragging the kids into the kitchen}}

:{{d|Louie}}: Come on, I even have a present for you!

:{{d|Gumball}}: No offense, Grandpa Louie, but...

::{{d|event|Another flashback starts. The kids are out in the backyard opening a present. They look inside}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: What the? {{d|event|grabs a single shoe from inside the box}} How are we supposed to play with this?

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Like so. 

::{{d|event|Granny Jojo grabs the shoe, puts it on the ground, and starts running around it while laughing and clapping her hands. After this, the flashback ends. Louie and the kids have made it to the kitchen}}

:{{d|Louie}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} I guess you won't want ''my'' present, then.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Nah... {{d|event|Sighs}} Of course we do.

:{{d|Louie}}: Here you go, guys. A check for being my favorite grandkids! {{d|event|Gives the kids the check}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wow, thanks. {{d|event|He sets the check on the ground and runs around it while clapping his hands}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Gumball, it's a check! You take it to the bank and you exchange it for money!

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin, and Anais scream excitedly before they pick up Louie, throwing him in the air a few times while chanting "yes!" They then hug him, but he gets shot up into the air and through the roof}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Sorry!

:{{d|Louie}}: It's OK. That was all I wanted. Spend the money wisely!

::{{d|event|Gumball picks up the check}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: How much is it for?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|gasps}} Five dollars!

:{{d|Anais}}: Your thumb's in the way.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Moves his thumb to the right, then gasps again}} Fifty dollars! {{d|event|Moves his thumb more and gasps again}} Five-hundred? {{d|event|Does so again}} Five-thousand?! {{d|event|He moves his thumb one more time, but nothing else is on the check}} Oh. Five thousand. Wait. Five thousand dollars?!

:{{d|Darwin}}: Make it rain! 

::{{d|event|Gumball slides his hand over the check as Darwin laughs}} 

:{{d|Darwin}}: Maybe we should go to the bank and get it cashed.

:{{d|Anais}}: No, let's figure out what to do with the money first.

::{{d|event|Everyone starts thinking about how to spend the money}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

::{{d|event|Darwin and Anais nod their head "yes"}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: We should spend it on-

:{{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|In unison with Gumball}} We should spend it on making the world a better place!

:{{d|Gumball}}: I was going to say {{d|event|Singsong voice}} Vegas! Now I feel like some sort of... I mean... Yeah. Yours is better.

==Darwin's Charity Plan==

:{{d|Darwin}}: I would use the money to set up a charity.

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of Darwin walking in town. He sees a hobo sitting on the sidewalk}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Narrating}} It would start out small...

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Holds a dollar}} Here, my friend. Take it.

::{{d|event|The hobo takes the dollar}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Oh, don't be shy. Everyone needs human contact. {{d|event|Hugs the hobo}}

:{{d|Hobo}}: {{d|event|Pushes back Darwin}} No! I don't! Money's enough, thanks!

::{{d|event|Darwin pets the hobo on the head while the hobo is moaning}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Narrating}} And then it would get bigger.

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of the Wattersons' TV. A commercial for a beef cake is shown}}

:{{d|Announcer}}: For just ninety-nine cents!

::{{d|event|A commercial featuring Darwin comes on}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|On the TV}} How ya doing? Feeling comfortable? That's funny. 'Cause a lot of people on this planet aren't. In fact, there's a lot of people who have it really, really bad. How does that make you feel? Are you proud? Are you still feeling good? What is wrong with you?! Give them money! Give us money so we can give it to them! DO IT NOW!!! GET OFF YOUR COUCH AND DO IT!!! DO IT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!

::{{d|event|The commercial ends with a note saying "TO DONATE CALL (0800) 555-0119. WATTERSON AID CERTIFIED CHARITY." while a happy tune plays. Then cut to a shot of a skyscraper with a picture of Earth on it}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Narrating}} My charity would get bigger and bigger, and it would be called the Coalition of Really Really Useful People Together. 

::{{d|event|The camera pans up to the top of the skyscraper, which shows a sign showing the acronym for the company: C.O.R.R.U.P.T. Then cut to a shot of the inside}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: First order of business, expanding the charity so we can help as many people as possible. So, how much money have we raised?

:{{d|Dolphin Man}}: Well, the TV campaign raised over three million dollars.

:{{d|Darwin}}: Hooray!

:{{d|Dolphin Man}}: So, after paying for the offices, the media budget and the salaries for our advisers, we're left with twelve dollars and thirty cents to spend on actual charitable deeds.

:{{d|Jeff}}: Ahem.

:{{d|Dolphin Man}}: Oh, sorry. Five dollars and twenty-nine cents. Jeff bought donuts.

:{{d|Darwin}}: But that's not enough!

:{{d|Goblin}}: Yes, but if a charity can't take care of itself, it can't take care of others.

:{{d|Darwin}}: But I just wanted to help people.

:{{d|Dolphin Man}}: Exactly, so we need to make ''even more'' money by diversifying it to other areas such as Toxic Waste Management. {{d|event|Gives Darwin a pen}} We just need you to sign off on that.

:{{d|Darwin}}: OK! I don't see a problem with Toxic Waste Management. {{d|event|As he says this, he signs a paper}}

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of Darwin in a toxic waste dump site}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uh, does anyone need any help from my charity? Maybe just a hug? Hello?

::{{d|event|Zombie versions of Masami, Carrie, Leslie, Tobias, Carmen and Sarah pop out and approach Darwin. He starts screaming as it cuts to the living room, where the kids are sitting on the couch}}

==Anais's Plan for World Peace==

:{{d|Anais}}: I would use the money to make more money. {{d|event|A computer suddenly appears}} First, I would invest in a portfolio of high risk shares on the stock exchange.

::{{d|event|Cut back to the couch}}

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: What?

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of Anais in the bedroom}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Sighs}} 

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of Anais cutting a dollar in half in a dollar-filled environment}}

:{{d|Anais}}: First, I would invest in things and when they do well, I make money.

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Cut back to the couch}} What?

:{{d|Anais}}: Listen. 

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of Anais wearing glasses and standing in front of lots of stacks of dollars}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Greed minus morals times lack of empathy plus slicked back hair equals '''ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD!!!'''

:{{d|Gumball}} and {{d|Darwin}}: Oh!

:{{d|Anais}}: Once I have all the money in the world, all I have to do is...

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Cut back to the couch, in a sing-song voice}} Go to Vegas!

:{{d|Anais}}: No, I have to destroy it all.

:{{d|Darwin}}: What? Why?

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of Anais cutting a dollar in half in a dollar-filled environment}}

:{{d|Anais}}: To bring people together.

::{{d|event|Anais makes paper dolls using a dollar, then cut to Anais dancing with life-size versions of said paper dolls}}

:{{d|Anais}}: In my money-free world, {{d|event|Cut to a shot of Banana Bob driving}} you won't need a car to go to work. 

::{{d|event|Banana Bob's car vanishes and he drops onto the ground, then cut to a shot of Harold painting his house}} 

:{{d|Anais}}: Because you won't need to work to pay for material things! 

::{{d|event|Harold's house vanishes, causing the ladder he's standing on to fall, then cut to a shot of some employees on an elevator}} 

:{{d|Anais}}: You won't need to wear a suit to pretend you're someone you're not, {{d|event|The employees' clothes vanish, leaving them naked}} because everyone will be free to be one with nature.

::{{d|event|The employees run joyfully out of the building naked, then cut to the Wattersons with others in a forest wearing nothing but leaf garments}}

:{{d|Anais}}: We won't eat meat, we'll never fight, we'll be incapable of hurting anything ever again! It will be paradise!

::{{d|event|Suddenly, a butterfly lands on a flower that traps it, then Mr. Small runs away from a bear. The Wattersons then get attacked by wolves}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Oh, yeah. Predators.

::{{d|event|Anais is swooped away by a bird, screaming. Cut back to the kids on the couch, where Darwin is screaming. Everyone sighs, then Gumball points at himself so the others can hear what he would do with the money. The two let him speak}}

==Gumball for President==

:{{d|Gumball}}: I would use the money to buy a new suit and tie to become president of the world!

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of Gumball sitting in front of the computer in his room. He is in a suit and tie}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{D|event|New England accent}} If you vote for me, I promise you a seven day weekend and state issue mobility scooters. I'll replace the water supply with soda, and the sidewalks with conveyor belts, AND I'll make pizza delivery the fourth emergency service.

::{{d|event|Gumball holds up a hand-drawn sign saying "VOTE GUMBALL" in front of the camera}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{D|event|Normal voice}} Then all I have to do is put it on the Internet.

:{{d|Anais}}: {{D|event|Cut back to the couch}} Gumball, have you seen how many videos there are of fatheads asking to be president? You'd just be another drop of dumbness in the online ocean of idiocy.

:{{d|Gumball}}: Do-do-do. Wait until you see my viral trump card!

::{{d|event|Cut to Hot Dog Guy looking on the computer at Gumball's trump card. It is a video of Gumball making hand fart noises in the tune of the Star-Spangled Banner}}

:{{d|Hot Dog Guy}}: {{D|event|Laughs}} Gets my vote!

:{{d|Soulless office worker}}: I don't know what he stands for, but he sure gets my vote!

:{{d|Sheep}}: {{D|event|Makes "baa" sound, and subtitles appear saying "Well, if everyone else is voting for him..."}}

:{{d|Anais}}: OK, Mr. President. So what are you going to do when everyone's so fat from eating pizza and not walking that they need a grabbing stick to grab their grabbing stick?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Everyone will have ROBOT SERVANTS!

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of the Wattersons' TV. A news report is coming on, with the title being: BREAKING NEWS}}

:{{d|News Reporter}}: We've had more reports of robot servants refusing to obey commands.

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of Pantsbully and his robot servant. The robot is trying to give Pantsbully pizza, but instead keeps slapping him with it}}

:{{d|News Reporter}}: They seem to have developed a will of their own and are now violently rebelling against their owners.

::{{d|event|In the time it takes for the news reporter to say this, the scene cuts to a robot servant carrying his owner to his car. However, the robot throws his owner out of sight and drives the car itself. Then cut to a shot of a huge fire in Elmore, with a couple of helicopters on the scene}}

:{{d|News Reporter}}: Scientists are baffled by what people are now calling {{D|event|Explosion, then text saying "ROBOLUTION" appears}} the Robolution.

::{{d|event|Cut to a shot of a robot servant. It turns around and stares at the viewer while a drum beat like that of the "Terminator" theme song plays. Its eyes turn red, then TV static interrupts the news report. Then cut to a shot of President Gumball in his office}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{D|event|New England accent}} My fellow Americans, I think we all know where this is going, {{d|event|Normal voice}} so let's just skip to the end.

::{{d|event|President Gumball pushes a button that causes a giant explosion visible through the window behind him, meaning that a nuclear war/explosion has just occurred. A scream can be heard, and when the scene cuts back to the couch, it turns out Anais is muffling Darwin's scream}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Since all our ideas end with the total destruction of humanity, why don't we just split the money?

:{{d|Darwin}}: OK! What's five-thousand divided by three?

:{{d|Anais}}: Well, it doesn't divide equally. One of us will have to be a penny short.

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin and Anais start shouting at each other about who ends up a penny short}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Well, it can't be me because I deserve to be treated more equally than everyone else!

::{{d|event|Richard takes the check from out of Gumball's hand}}

:{{d|Richard}}: If you are incapable of sharing this money, then I'll take it and spend it on myself to teach you a valuable life lesson. {{D|event|Get tripped on the floor, then Nicole pops up}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Like your father said, we need this money for more important things.

:{{d|Gumball}}: HEY! YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT! IT'S MINE!!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Not if I get to the bank first! {{D|event|Dashes outside}}

==Invisible Car Chase to the Bank==

:{{d|Richard}}: HEY!!! GIVE IT BACK!! {{D|event|He and the kids chase after her}} YOU'RE JUST GONNA SQUANDER IT ON FOOD AND BILLS AND ALL THE STUFF THAT KEEPS US ALIVE!!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Exactly! {{D|event|Mimics door close sound}} Like getting the car fixed! {{D|event|Mimics noise of starting an imaginary car and drives away at high speed}}

:{{d|Richard}}: What the..?

:{{d|Darwin}}: How did she do that?

:{{d|Anais}}: And if she ''can'' do that, then why does she need the money to fix the car?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|He jumps and slides over his invisible car before getting inside it}} Just shut it and drive!

::{{d|event|Darwin puts on invisible seatbelt, Gumball starts his invisible car and mimics noise of revving it motor and Richard puts on a trucker hat. Gumball makes his "car" do a few donuts before speeding after Nicole. Darwin and Anais promptly follow him while Richard's "truck" is not moving}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Why isn't my invisible truck working?! Oh yeah.. {{d|event|Pushes the hand brake down, causing the truck to immediately speed up}} AAAAHHHHH!!!

::{{d|event|The Watterson family are in high-speed invisible car chase across town, trying to claim the check for themselves. Nicole moves her invisible rear view mirror and is too late to notice Gumball ramming his invisible car into hers}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Stop it! That's reckless driving!!

:{{d|Gumball}}: Not without a car, it's not!!! {{d|event|He continues to ram into Nicole's car to steer it off the road while Nicole struggles}} Give me the check!! We clearly don't need a car!! {{d|event|Continues to push the car while sticking his hand out trying to reach the check}} Give me that!!! 

::{{d|event|Gumball reaches for the check, but gasps as he and Nicole see Richard speeding toward them, running into Nicole's car hard enough to break her invisible wind shield and knock her unconscious. Gumball tries to reach the check, but doesn't keep his eyes on the road and speeds out of control on the pavement}} 

:{{d|Gumball}}: AAAAAHHHHHHGGGHHH!!!!!

::{{d|event|Gumball breaks through a picket fence and knocks over a fire hydrant, coming to a stop next to it as it sprays water on top of him. Gumball then makes noises of an invisible folding roof setting up in his car. He signs in relief at being shielded from the water}}

::{{d|event|Nicole, unconscious in her still-moving car, accidentally drops the check and it falls onto the ground, where Richard stops by and picks it up while laughing with glee. Nicole slowly wakes up and sees road construction in her way. She quickly tries to get control but is too late as her invisible car drives onto a dirt ramp. She screams as the car goes flying and crashes into a house. Richard drives by and laughs}}

::{{d|event|Mr. Small drives peacefully in his minivan, listening to music, when Anais and Darwin appear on both sides of his van. Darwin switches his imaginary gear while Anais cranks down her imaginary window}}

:{{d|Anais}}: Err... which way is the bank?

:{{d|Mr. Small}}​​​​​​​: Take a left, then a second right.

:{{d|Anais}}: Thank you! {{d|event|Pulls her imaginary window back up and speeds toward the bank with Darwin in pursuit}}

::{{d|event|Richard pulls an imaginary truck horn while making horn noises. He laughs a bit before being struck by a screaming Nicole, who was still flying out of control. His "truck" tumbles and bounces and, in the span of one bounce, Anais drives underneath him and snatches the check from his hand. She narrowly escapes with it as Richard's truck explodes. Anais then spots Gumball driving right toward her. She gasps and hits the brakes before switching to reverse. Gumball rams her car three times and as they reach the burning remains of Richard's truck, Darwin drives out of the fire and attempts to ram them. Anais sees him and stops the car in time, causing Darwin to drive screaming toward a lamp post and slam into it, knocking him down while his mouth takes the shape of a broken car hood. Anais and Gumball resume their struggle and she continues to drive in reverse, before pulling an immediate turn, leaving Gumball to drive head-first into a street sign. He makes noises of the car shuttering. Anais drives with the check towards the bank as the rest of her family, all battered and bruised, catch up to her}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Give that back!!

:{{d|Anais}}: Hey!!

:{{d|Nicole}}: No! It's mine!!

:{{d|Richard}}: Gimme that check!!

::{{d|event|While they fight, Anais gasps in alarm as they were dangerously driving towards the bank. Everyone notices and collectively hit their brakes, but are too late to stop in time. After crashing through the door, the Wattersons get out of their cars while arguing and struggling for the check towards the clerk counter. Darwin stops them while holding the check}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Wait! Wait! 

::{{d|event|Darwin Takes out imaginary car remote and makes noises of car alarm being set. Gumball snatches the check from him and they all resume fighting for the check in front of Larry}}

:{{d|Larry}}: Hey guys, guys, '''guys!''' What's the problem?

:{{d|Gumball}}: We were given five thousand dollars and we can't work out what to do! {{d|event|Puts the check on Larry's desk}}

:{{d|Larry}}: Five thousand dollars between the five of you? Well, that's a thousand dollars each!

:{{d|Richard}}, {{d|Nicole}}, {{d|Anais}}, {{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Gumball}}: YEAH! A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH!!

::{{d|event|The Wattersons heard motor noises and see Louie driving on an imaginary Moped, who stops in front of them and takes off his imaginary helmet}}

:{{d|Louie}}: Wait up! Wait up! Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. {{d|event|Panting}} I forgot the decimal point. {{d|event|Puts decimal point in the middle of five-thousand making it fifty}} There. {{d|event|Gives the updated check to Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Groans}} Fifty dollars? {{d|event|Gasps}} Wait!

:{{d|Richard}}, {{d|Nicole}}, {{d|Anais}}, {{d|Darwin}} and {{d|Gumball}}: YEAH!! TEN DOLLARS EACH!!

::{{d|event|They happily pick Louie up, throw him in the air a few times and then they hug him. Like before, the combined hug makes him shoot through the roof}}

::{{d|event|Episode ends}}
