==Fixing the TV==
::{{d|event|The episode starts in the living room where Richard puts down a plate of cookies and uses the remote to switch on the TV; he taps the remote several times but nothing happens, he holds up the remote and sees the battery compartment is empty and then he sees some batteries on the table}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Puts his finger on his lips}} Hmmmm...

::{{d|event|Richard starts throwing batteries at the TV until the screen breaks}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Puts his finger on his lips}} Hmmmm...

::{{d|event|Richard starts pounding the TV then looks down at the wire connected to the TV}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Puts his finger on his lips}} Hmmmm...

::{{d|event|Richard uses a chainsaw and cuts a hole to the backyard then looks at the satellite dish}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Puts his finger on his lips}} Hmmmm...

::{{d|event|Richard tries to jump up to the satellite dish several times then he sees a ladder behind him}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Puts his finger on his lips}} Hmmmm...

::{{d|event|Richard uses the ladder to smash the satellite dish several times, and goes back inside to check on the TV, which is of course still off}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Angrily}} Hmmmm!

::{{d|event|Richard goes to the kitchen and takes everything out of a drawer and sees a TV repair card, some forks and tape}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Puts his finger on his lips}} Hmmmm...

::{{d|event|Richard goes back to the backyard and uses tape and forks to climb to the roof then throws batteries at the satellite dish, one of the batteries hit him, causing him to fall off the roof then the satellite dish crushes his face, knocking him out unconscious}}

==At the Hospital==
::{{d|event|Richard wakes up in the hospital and sees the rest of the Wattersons}}

:{{d|Richard}}: What happened?

:{{d|Bandage Doctor}}: You are very lucky Mr. Watterson, it appears your skull is so thick you were able to survive a half a ton of tiles and a satellite dish falling on your head.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Is he going to be okay, doctor?

:{{d|Bandage Doctor}}: Apart from being living proof that we're doomed as a species, he's fine, I just need a signature from whoever is responsible for him.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh that would be me.

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} I don't think so!

::{{d|event|Camera zooms in Granny Jojo's face}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: That would be his mother.

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Laughs nervously}} Granny Jojo, what a pleasure.

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: I wish I could say the same but it seems I have no other choice but to move in and sort out your family which you are clearly incapable of taking care of.

::{{d|event|Nicole gets very angry and starts breathing heavily}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Notices his mother's fury}} Uh doctor, what's the cheapest object in this room?

:{{d|Bandage Doctor}}: Probably that. {{d|event|Points to an IV pole}}

::{{d|event|Gumball grabs the rack and gives it to Darwin, who passes it on to Nicole; and she bends the pole out of shape effortlessly}}

:{{d|Bandage Doctor}}: That was still worth about three hundred dollars.

::{{d|event|Nicole sighs and bends the pole back to normal as Jojo shakes her head scornfully}}

==Crossing the Road==
::{{d|event|The Wattersons walk out of the hosiptal}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: So, Granny Jojo, why are you staying with us?

::{{d|event|The Wattersons stop at a pedestrian crossing}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Because someone has to look after your safety, kid.

:{{d|Nicole}}: I think they're perfectly safe with me, now look left then right before you cross that road Gumball.

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: No, you look right then left, that way you see the nearest car first.

::{{d|event|Gumball turns left then right}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: But while you're looking left, something maybe coming from the other direction, look right again, sweetie.

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: No, look left!

::{{d|event|Gumball starts turning left and right repeatedly}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Look right.

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Left!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Right!

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: LEFT!

:{{d|Nicole}}: RIGHT!

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: LEFT!

:{{d|Nicole}}: RIGHT!

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: LEFT!

:{{d|Nicole}}: RIGHT!

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: ''LEFT!''

::{{d|event|Gumball's head starts turning rapidly before it completely splits in half}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Now run, it's better to cross the road as quickly as possible.

::{{d|event|Gumball starts running across the road}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: No, you might trip and fall, just walk.

::{{d|event|Gumball walks across the road and walks past Felicity and her son Billy}}

:{{d|Felicity}}: Oh, don't worry, Billy, it's a really good hospita-AAHH!!!

::{{d|event|Felicity and Billy scream at Gumball's head}}

==Bad Mother==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the Wattersons' front yard where Gumball is attempting a skateboard trick while Darwin watches him; Anais takes a photo of Gumball as he jumps; Nicole and Granny Jojo looks out from a window}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Dude, I think the board is supposed to jump as well.

::{{d|event|Camera changes to Nicole and Granny Jojo; she is too short, so only her ears are visible}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: See, this is exactly the kind of thing I was worried about.

:{{d|Nicole}}: How would you know, you're not even tall enough to look out the window!

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: I don't need to, I know how dangerous the world is.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh come on, he's wearing all the protective gear, what the worst that could happen?

::{{d|event|Gumball tries to do the trick again but the board hits his crotch}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Argh, you stupid board-

::{{d|event|Gumball throws the board but it hits his face then he steps and trips on the board and it hits Darwin's face then the board bounces and hits Anais's face}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Talks very fast}} Oh my gosh, you're right, I'm a terrible mother.

::{{d|event|Granny Jojo snaps her fingers a couple of times}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Follow me.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the inside of the house which Granny Jojo walks and show Nicole what she have done}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Corner padding,

::{{d|event|Granny Jojo walks to the staircase}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Socket covers.

::{{d|event|Points to the steel door on the staircase}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Stair guard.

::{{d|event|Walks up the staircase and opens the bathroom door}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: A good mother prevents the incident before it happens.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Richard bathing then he falls into a catch net; Nicole stares in horror}}

:{{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Looks down}} The worst part is that it's working.

::{{d|event|Granny Jojo closes the door}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Shocked}} I always thought I was a good mother...

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: But you're not, are you?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Maybe it's because of stress or something-

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: {{d|event|Pats Nicole's hand}} Don't worry about it.

:{{d|Nicole}}: But they're my family, they need me!

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: They need me more.

::{{d|event|Nicole sighs and dejectedly walks down the stairs}}

==It's Not Safe==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the living room; Gumball is playing a video game while Granny Jojo walks towards him}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Excuse me sweetie, I forgot to ask your mom to buy some milk before she left for work, do you mind running to the store to pick some up?

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gets off couch and takes money}} Sure.

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Good boy, now you be careful outside.

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Scoffs}} Yeah right, who knows? I might get jumped by a garden gnome.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to a street; Gumball is walking home with the milk; a car comes and tries to hit Gumball}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Panting and scared}} What the what?

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: This lesson shows that nobody is safe the moment they leave their house.

::{{d|event|Gumball faints and loses his outline, making him melt down into a puddle of blue ink; scene changes to the kitchen where Darwin is using a knife to spread butter on his bread; Granny Jojo with a fake arm appears}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: What are you doing sweetie?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Just making a sandwich.

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: {{d|event|Takes knife from Darwin}} Well let me show you how to do it safely. {{d|event|Cuts her bread; her fake arm falls off}}

::{{d|event|Granny Jojo screams, then Darwin screams as well; the camera shows the two screaming at each other repeatedly; then Granny Jojo reveals her real arm, but Darwin continues screaming}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: That lesson shows that nobody is safe when there's a knife around, so get out of here!

::{{d|event|Darwin runs away screaming; scene changes to the bedroom where Anais is trying to close the window and then Granny Jojo comes in}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Ah hold on sweetie, let me get that for you.

::{{d|event|Anais gets down; Granny Jojo goes up and slams the window which explodes; camera zooms to Anais who is in shock then camera changes back to Granny Jojo}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: {{d|event|Muffled}} And this lesson shows that nobody is safe around windows.

::{{d|event|Anais pants while Granny Jojo walks out of the room}}

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the backyard shed where Richard is walking to the shed with some planks; his hand goes toward the shed's doorknob, but then he hesitates; camera changes between Richard's terrifed face and hand as he decides what to do; he gives up, drops the planks and runs off; the door slowly opens revealing Granny Jojo inside with a saw; she is standing on one leg and holding a fake leg in the air}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: And this is why you don't play with tools! {{d|event|Puts down fake leg and stands on two legs}} Oh, looks like my work here is done.

==Turned Into Richard==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the Wattersons' living room where everyone is at couch eating junk food}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Eating}} Why are we eating like this?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Because it's the only thing... {{d|event|Eats marshmallow}} ...I'm not terrified of doing.

:{{d|Anais}}: I don't think it's very good to stop using our brains like this, I can feel myself getting dumber-rer.

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: {{d|event|Walks in and puts a hamburger on the table}} You have nothing to worry about anymore, all you'll ever need is right here.

::{{d|event|Everyone breathes a sigh of relief and continues eating junk food; After a while, everyone looks as fat as Richard, not only they became like Richard, but also lose their senses; Gumball presses the remote, but the TV does not turn on}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Wuh?

::{{d|event|Gumball presses the remote a couple more times and sees the battery compartment is empty and looks at the table with batteries on it}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Puts his finger on his lips}} Hmmmm...

::{{d|event|Gumball starts throwing batteries at the TV until it breaks}}

:{{d|All}}: {{d|event|Puts their fingers on their lips}} Hmmmm...

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Off-screen}} What the?! 

::{{d|event|Camera zooms out showing Nicole and Granny Jojo}} 

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Angry}} What have you done to them? They've all have turned into Richard!

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Well, at least they're safe!

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} It's because of your parenting that Richard had that accident. Wait, it's because of your parenting that he has no common sense whatsoever, you protected him his entire life, never letting him think for himself, and now he can hardly think at all!

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Richard's brain which is full of static}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Richard! Richard! Richard!!

::{{d|event|Scene changes back to the living room}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Huh?

:{{d|Nicole}}: Take the kids and go buy some milk.

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: What do you think you're doing?!

:{{d|Nicole}}: I'm trying to revive their brains.

::{{d|event|Gumball, Darwin and Anais walk to the front door, Gumball smacks into it, and so do Darwin and Anais}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Uhh... does anyone remember how to open a door?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Yeah, I think you're supposed to turn that. {{d|event|Points at door knob}}

::{{d|event|Gumball opens the door but he falls and hits Darwin, Anais, and Richard, causing them to fall as well; Then they all try to get out at the same time, causing them to get stuck in the doorway}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, {{d|Anais}}, and {{d|Richard}}: Huh?

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Nicole and Granny Jojo who are behind the couch}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: If you think I'm letting you send them out into danger, you got another thing coming!

:{{d|Nicole}}: If you think I'm gonna let you mess with my family anymore, you got this chair coming!

::{{d|event|Nicole takes the chair and hits Granny Jojo but the chair bounces off}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: What the?

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Good luck trying to stop me Nicole, I've safe-proofed this whole house.

::{{d|event|Nicole throws a flower pot at Granny Jojo but it bounces off again}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Everything breakable is now plastic.

::{{d|event|Nicole takes a lamp and hits Granny Jojo but it bounces off}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Everything else is rubber.

::{{d|event|Nicole takes a painting and hits Granny Jojo but the paper tears and goes through Granny Jojo}}
:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Apart from that, which was paper. A good mother prevents accidents before they happen.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to a fire background with Nicole's eyes burning with anger}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: I AM A GOOD MOTHER!

::{{d|event|Nicole pounces on Granny Jojo and starts pulling her ear and uses her hand to slap her face}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Say it!

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: No.

:{{d|Nicole}}: Say it!

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: No!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Say i'm a good mother!

::{{d|event|Scene changes back to Richard and the trio who are still squeezing out of the door, then Anais pops out and hits the car}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|Puts her finger on his lips}} Hmmmm...

::{{d|event|Scene changes back to Nicole who is still slapping Granny Jojo until they hear the car's engine starting}}

==The Expressway Chase==
::{{d|event|Scene changes to the street as Nicole and Granny Jojo watch Richard drive off}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Noooooo! You've sent them to a highway of eternal doom in a chariot of pain and despair! My babies! My babies!!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Oh please, Richard is perfectly capable of driving to the store.

::{{d|event|Richard runs a red light, causing a major traffic accident}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Shocked}} I'll get the car.

::{{d|event|Scene changes to the expressway with the kids screaming}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Dad, you need to stop the car!

::{{d|event|Camera changes Gumball and Richard, who is using his butt to steer}}

:{{d|Richard}}: I can't, I can't remember how to drive!

:{{d|Anais}}: Hmm, you're clearly doing something wrong, I just don't know what.

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, {{d|Anais}}, and {{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|Puts their fingers on their lips}} Hmmmm...

:{{d|Gumball}}: Oh oh I got it, you forgot your seat belt.

::{{d|event|Everyone agrees and Gumball help to put Richard's seat belt on, then Nicole's car appears; they scream}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Stop the car!

:{{d|Richard}}: I don't know how!

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Well start by looking the right way!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Don't give them the answers, they have to figure it out by themselves. {{d|event|Camera changes to Richard's car}} Just use your common sense, honey, it's okay to make mistakes!

::{{d|event|Richard turns around and seats in the right direction}}

:{{d|Richard}}: Okay, I need a little help here, how do you stop a car?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Well it depends, are we moving forward or is the world moving backwards?

:{{d|Anais}}: Whatever it is, the answer must be in this car!

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, {{d|Anais}}, and {{d|Richard}}: LET'S PUSH ALL THE BUTTONS!

::{{d|event|Everyone pushes a random button and causes the car to do multiple stuff}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: Agh, what we do now?

:{{d|Richard}}: I think the right thing to do is flail our arms and scream in panic.

::{{d|event|Everyone screams in panic as the car goes under a truck in a gas station, causing the car's roof and hood to be torn off; they return to the expressway; Scene changes to Nicole's car}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: Uh, okay, that was a pretty good mistake, what did you learn from that?

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Nicole, I have to put a end to this right now.

::{{d|event|Granny Jojo jumps out of the car in slow-motion}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|In slow-motion}} Nooooooo!

::{{d|event|Nicole rams Richard's car and stops Granny Jojo from jumping into it and starts wrapping the seat belt around her}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Your family is in danger and you- 

::{{d|event|Nicole grabs Granny Jojo's mouth and puts it into the glove compartment}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: My family is fine, they just need the right incentive.

::{{d|event|Nicole drives her car ahead of Richard's}} 

:{{d|Richard}}: No no, don't leave us!

::{{d|event|Nicole stops her car in the middle of the expressway, gets out and stands in the middle of the expressway}}

:{{d|Gumball}}: We've got to stop the car!

:{{d|Anais}}: But how?

:{{d|Darwin}}: Have you tried saying please?

:{{d|Gumball}}: Don't be silly, just do as I do.

::{{d|event|Gumball opens his car door and puts a foot on the road, everyone follows him; their feet get burned; they scream as they put out the flames on their feet}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, {{d|Anais}}, and {{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|See Nicole ahead and scream}} Get off the road!

:{{d|Nicole}}: No, you can do it, honey!

::{{d|event|Granny Jojo grabs her mouth and winds down the car's window, then she holds her mouth outside the window}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: Are you crazy?!

:{{d|Nicole}}: Come on guys, I believe in you, remember everything you've learned!

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Richard's car going into slow-motion}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Echo}} Learned, learned, learned, learned, learned.

::{{d|event|Camera changes to Darwin as he experiences a flashback; Darwin puts a bowl of food into a microwave and starts it but it explodes; Scene repeats but before Darwin starts the microwave...}}

:{{d|Darwin}}: Uh pap pap.

::{{d|event|Darwin takes out the spoon and starts the microwave}}

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Echo}} Remember...

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Gumball as he has his flashback; Gumball tries to get a chocolate bar from a vending machine by putting his hands into the machine and ends up getting stuck in it with a fireman having to cut the machine open; Scene repeats with Gumball sighing but this time he puts money into the vending machine}}

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Anais as she has her flashback; Anais holds on a cabinet door in the Wattersons' kitchen as she reaches for a jar of cookies but the door breaks off, causing her to faceplant onto the floor; Scene repeats but now it's Gumball trying to get the jar, he grabs it but the cabinet door breaks off again, causing him to faceplant onto the floor}}

:{{d|Anais}}: {{d|event|As she grabs the jar from Gumball}} Ha ha ha!

:{{d|Nicole}}: {{d|event|Echo}} Remember...

::{{d|event|Scene changes to Richard as he has his flashback; Richard was driving and whistling in his car and sees the red light but instead of pressing the brake, he presses the accelerator, causing the car to speed up and ram into Principal Brown's car; Scene changes back to the present in slow motion with everyone not being fat anymore}}

:{{d|Gumball}}, {{d|Darwin}}, {{d|Anais}}, and {{d|Richard}}: {{d|event|In slow-motion}} The brake!

::{{d|event|Richard presses on the brake and everyone screams while Nicole and Granny Jojo brace themselves; the car stops a few inches from Nicole; everyone laughs and then faints}}

:{{d|Granny Jojo}}: {{d|event|Gets out of the car and gasps}} Nicole, I-I-I'm sorry I ever doubted you, you are a good mother.

:{{d|Nicole}}: It's okay to make mistakes if you learn from them Granny Jojo, now if you'll excuse me, I just need to pass out as well.

::{{d|event|Nicole passes out and faceplants into the hood of the car then melts into a blob while Granny Jojo stares in shock; the episode ends}}
