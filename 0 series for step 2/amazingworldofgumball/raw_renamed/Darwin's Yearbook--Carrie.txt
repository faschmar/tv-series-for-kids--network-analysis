== Darwin + Carrie's Relationship Recap ==
''[The episode begins with a shot of the Watterson's house, and then switches to Gumball, Darwin and Anais' room. Darwin is shown on the bed typing on his computer.]''

{{d|Darwin}}: Ah, Carrie... ''[Cursor moving around on the unfinished yearbook around Carrie's spot]'' What sweet pleasure it would be to find a photograph of thee. ''[Proceeds to ElmorePlus' mini dashboard, clicking on Carrie's profile. Darwin clicks it, opening Carrie's Upload Page on Elmore StreamIT]'' Let's have a look at your uploads. ''[Zooms to amount of videos uploaded]'' 

Hm, [''cursor going around the words 'NO VIDEOS UPLOADED']'' no videos uploaded. I guess she's shy, like me. Which is why she's my girl. ''[Heads back to the mini ElmorePlus Dashboard and clicks Carrie's Profile again, opening a DM between them]''

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' Hey!

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' Hey!

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' Hey.‚ù§Ô∏è (emoji of red heart)

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' Hey.üñ§üñ§üñ§ (three emojis of black hearts side by side)

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' Whatcha thinkin about?

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' Us.

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' Me too.

''[Darwin's fantasy romantic moment with Carrie from "[[The Scam]]" is shown, with Darwin's song from "[[The Matchmaker]]" beginning to play in the background. The scene then transitions to Darwin sitting next to the bunk bed from a scene in "The Matchmaker", afterward beginning singing "[[Without You]]"]''

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[singing]'' Your smile answers my silent scream, your photo on the screen...

''[Various scenes of Carrie & Darwin from Various Episodes Play, after transitioning back to "The Matchmaker" scene, with Darwin still singing]''

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[singing]'' My eyes well up, I vent my spleen, your photo on the screen...

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[singing]'' Your chair a throne, you're like a queen, my heart is drenched in gasoline, you look at me, yet I'm unseen ,your photo on the screen...

''[While singing, various scenes of Carrie & Darwin from Various Episodes Play again, after transitioning back to "The Matchmaker" scene, with Darwin still singing]''

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[singing loudly ]'' Without you, I can't breathe! Without you, I can't breathe!

''[scene ends]''

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' Yeah, that's how I see us too.

''[Scary rock music shows, showing a compilation of scenes from Various episodes with Darwin and Carrie (and sometimes Gumball). Scene ends with Ghost Darwin shown behind a heart]''

== "So In Tune" ==
{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' *sighs* We are so in tune.

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' Yeah, apart from when it comes to actual tunes, remember.

''[Scene from "[[The Drama]]" shows]''

''[Darwin and Carrie are at the record store while Gumball still spies on them, disguised as a poster. Carrie listens to metal music with headphones on.]''

{{d|Darwin}}: What are you listening to?

{{d|Carrie}}: It's not really your style.

{{d|Darwin}}: Oh yeah? And what ''is'' my style? ''[Carrie shows him an album: "The Editones", with a photo of three live-action men in drag on the cover.]'' Okay. FYI, those girls yodeled everyone's socks off at the county fair! But that doesn't mean I don't like the rock and the roll!

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[laughs]'' Well, who are you into, then?

{{d|Darwin}}: Ha-ha! Oh, you wouldn't know them.

{{d|Carrie}}: They're called something like the Candy Bears or the Flannelettes, aren't they?

{{d|Darwin}}: Heh! No. ''[blushes]'' They're called the Lollipuppies. 

== Carrie's Soft Side ==
{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' You have a soft side too though.

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' I do not! üëéüèª (White thumbs down emoji)

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' Come on...

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' What?

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' You love PONIES!

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' SHUSH!! You said you'd never mention that again.

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' It's okay, we're on DM.

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' Yeah, but you never know when your being hacked.

{{d|bananajoe}}: ''[texting]'' HAAAhahaha - PONY LOVER! ‚ù§Ô∏è (red heart emoji)

{{d|Tobias}}‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã: ''[texting]'' Does that make you the GHOST RIDER? üëª (ghost emoji)

{{D|Leonard Daniels}}: ''[texting]'' I like ponies. (...) I like their pony hair.

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' Listen! It was just one DVD and it caught me at a weak moment okay?!

''[Scene from "[[The Pony]]" shows]''

''[Nightmare on Elmore Street falls out of the DVD case]''

{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Gasps}} Nightmare on Elmore Street?!

{{d|Darwin}}: So where's our DVD?

{{d|event|In Carrie's bedroom}}

{{d|Princess on TV}}: Oh, Loretta. If only he knew me the way you do...

{{d|event|Carrie, with a bucket of popcorn, is staring at the TV}}

{{d|Gumball}}: {{d|event|Barges in Carrie's room}} Carrie! {{d|event|Swings arms in front of her face}} {{d|event|Whispers to Darwin}} I think her horror movie brain got traumatized by an overload of pony cuteness.

{{d|Carrie}}: {{d|event|Drops popcorn}} I thought I was a hardcore horror movie fan, but I was living a lie! {{d|event|Grabs Gumball by the shirt}} Tell me, is it wrong for a punk-rock chick who lives in a haunted malevolent mansion to be touched by the magical friendship of a ''pony''?

{{d|Gumball}}: Mmmm, no, but can you tell your pet to stop rubbing itself on my leg, 'cause that's kind of wrong...

{{d|event|A zombie-like hand is seen scratching on Gumball's leg}}

{{d|Carrie}}: That's not a pet. That's my grandma.

''[scene freezes]''

== Photo for the yearbook... but goes off-topic ==
{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' It's okay Carrie, I know you're the most hardcore person in Elmore. And the cutest - which is why I need a photo of you for the yearbook cover.

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' Awesome. Hey, what about one of the times I possessed someone?

''[scene from "[[The Ghost]]" plays]''

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[Gumball starts eating Carrie's Lunch]'' I wish I still had a body.

{{d|Darwin}}: Why don't you use Gumball's?

{{d|Gumball}}: ''[Spits the food out]'' What? Me?

{{d|Carrie}}: Great! Thanks!

''[Carrie possesses Gumball's body, and others from various episodes shown in this montage]''

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' On second thought, you don't look your best in any of these scenarios.

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' Well I don't just possess people, you know. I can also exorcise.

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' Me too!

''[Various scenes from various episodes show '''Darwin's Physical Talent <u>Excercising</u>, not Exorcising''']''

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' No no no, exorcise - with an 'O'.

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[texting]'' Ahh right. Like with a hula-hoop.

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[texting]'' No! Like with Gumball's jealousy, remember?

''[scene from "[[The Flower]]" plays]''

<br />

== Carrie's First Marriage? ==
{{d|Darwin}}: That was terrifying.

{{d|Carrie}}: Yeah you really shouldn't hang around with me on Halloween.

{{d|Darwin}}: No, I mean the thought of you marrying someone else. But also yes, Halloweens with you are pretty intense.

''[scene from "[[Halloween]]" plays]''

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[Whispers]'' Okay, if anyone asks, don‚Äôt tell them you‚Äôre alive.

{{d|Darwin}}: Tell who?

{{d|Carrie}}: You‚Äôre going to have to make sure that... ''[Whispers so low Gumball and Darwin can‚Äôt hear]''

{{d|Gumball}}: Um, sorry, you were a little too quiet on the second part.

{{d|Carrie}}: [Sighs] I said, you‚Äôre going to have to make sure that... ''[Gumball and Darwin tries to listen closely]''

{{d|Gumball}}: ''[In an irritated tone]'' Are you doing this on purpose? Because it‚Äôs kinda annoying.

{{d|Carrie}}: I said, you going to‚Äî

{{d|Darwin}}: ''[Shouting]'' '''JUST TELL US ALREADY! WHY. ARE WE WHISPERING. IN AN EMPTY HOUSE?!'''

{{d|Carrie}}: ''[Makes a green potion appear]'' Just drink some of this potion and you will see. It will make you part ghost. ''[Hands the potion to Gumball]'' But no more than a drop, understand?

{{d|Darwin}}: What are you doing? You‚Äôre too young to be drinking mysterious potions!

{{d|Gumball}}: Oh don‚Äôt be a square, what‚Äôs the worst that can happen? ''[Opens the bottle and a green ghost-shaped smoke comes out]'' ''[In a nervous tone]'' Um, are you sure we are going to be okay?

{{d|Carrie}}: As long as you only have one. drop.

{{d|Darwin}}: See? THAT‚ÄôS the thing. Anything you can only have one drop of what can‚Äôt be good. They don‚Äôt sell milk by the drop, do they? They would sell it by the GALLON! Look at water, that‚Äôs good for you. Which is why it comes out of the '''FAUCET!''' ''[Gumball places a drop of the potion into Darwin‚Äôs mouth]'' '''OOOOOOOOOOOOH...'''

{{d|Gumball}}: I think I might give this potion a miss.

''[scene ends]''

{{d|Carrie}}: Man, Gumball is such a wuss. I don't know how you put up with him.

{{d|Darwin}}: Then I'm glad you didn't see that alternative version of the future.

''[scene from "[[The Shippening]]" plays]''

{{d|Gumball}}: I don't see how this day could get any weir-aaaaaand {{d|event|Points offscreen}} here we go.

{{d|event|The shot then changes to a strangely-drawn adult Gumball and Carrie on a bench, holding a baby}}

{{d|Darwin}}: {{d|event|Yells}} WHAT THE? DUDE! THIS IS SO MESSED UP!

{{d|Gumball}}: I know, right? I mean, a future me? Wearing sandals?

''[scene ends]''

{{d|Carrie}}: Eww Nightmare Family!
