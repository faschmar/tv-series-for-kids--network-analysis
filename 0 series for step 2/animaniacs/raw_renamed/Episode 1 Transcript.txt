== Newsreel Of The Stars ==
'''Narrator''': "Newsreel of the Stars", dateline Hollywood 1930. The Warner Brothers studio. Here at the studio's new animation department, the artists toil endlessly to come up with cartoon stars. Ultimately creating three new characters: the Warner Brothers and their sister Dot.

'''[[Yakko Warner|Yakko]], [[Wakko Warner|Wakko]] and [[Dot Warner|Dot]]''': Hello, nurse!

'''Narrator''': Unfortunately, the Warner kids went totally out of control.

'''Yakko, Wakko and Dot''': Boingy, boingy, boingy, boingy!

'''Narrator''': The trio ran amok throughout the studio...until their capture. The Warners' films, which made absolutely no sense, were locked away in the studio vault, never to be released. As for the Warners themselves, they were locked away in the studio water tower, also never to be released. Publicly, the studio has disavowed any knowledge of the Warners' existence to this very day...when the Warners escaped!

== Theme song ==
(music)

'''Yakko, Wakko and Dot:''' It's time for Animaniacs! And we're zany to the max! So just sit back and relax, you'll laugh till you collapse, we're Animaniacs!

'''Yakko and Wakko''': Come join the Warner Brothers...

'''Dot''': ..and the Warner sister Dot!

'''Yakko, Wakko and Dot''': Just for fun, we run around the Warner movie lot! They lock us in the tower whenever we get caught, but we break loose and then vamoose and now you know the plot!

We're Animaniacs, Dot is cute and Yakko yaks; Wakko packs away the snacks while Bill Clinton plays the sax; we're Animaniacs!

Meet Pinky and the Brain who want to rule the universe, Goodfeathers flock together, Slappy whacks them with her purse, Buttons chases Mindy, while Rita sings a verse, The writers flipped, We have no script, Why bother to rehearse?

'''All''': We're Animaniacs, We have pay-or-play contracts, we're zany to the max, there's baloney in our slacks! We're Animanie, totally insane-y

'''Dot''': Here's the show's name-y

'''All''': Animaniacs! Those are the facts!

'''[[Dr. Scratchansniff]]''': I suppose it would be vise to start at ze very beginning, ja?

'''[[Yakko Warner|Unknown Psychiatrist]]''': Proceed.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Uh. I was one of the most successful psychoanalysts in all of Hollywood. ''[flashback]'' 50 years ago, I started work at Warner Brothers. Ah, Warner Brothers, home to some of ze biggest stars in Hollywood.

'''Ralph T. Guard''': Ah, good morning mr. biggest star in Hollywood.

'''Mr. Biggest Star in Hollywood''': Morning, sweetheart.

'''Ralph T. Guard''': Uh-ah, morning, Porky

'''[[Porky Pig]]''': g-g-g-uh-g-g-g-uh-g-uh-g-g-uh-g-g-uh-m-m-mo-uh-m-uh-m-uh-m-uh-muh-muh-. All right!! Hello.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': (narrating) And when the stars had a problem, they came to me.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff:''' So, tell me more about these dreams you've been having, Mr. Reagan.

'''Ronald Reagan''': Well, in my dreams, I'm president of the United States.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': (narrating) (writes: Delusions of grandeur, Incurable). For years, the biggest actors told me their problems, their secrets, their pain! Ooh, it was so much fun! And then just recently, I had just completed a delightfully intense session with Clint Eastwood. Then...it happened.

'''Crowd''': *screaming* What is that? What's going on up there?

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': (narrating) It was them...the Varner Brothers! After years of being locked away in the water tower... they managed to escape!

'''Dot''': Did you miss us?

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': I hardly even know you.

'''Yakko and Wakko''': We're the Warner Brothers!

'''Dot''': And the Warner sister!

'''Yakko, Wakko and Dot''': Mmmm! (they all kiss Dr. Scratchansniff)

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Eh! Pleh! Pleh! Pleh! Pleh! Bleh! AAH! What do you want?

'''Yakko''': We asked you first.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Well, I want--no, you didn't.

'''Dot''': Well, we meant to.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Do you know who I am?

'''Yakko''': Dr. Otto Scratchansniff, world-famous psychoanalyst to the stars?

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Correct.

'''Yakko''': I won! I won! What did I win!?

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Nothing.

'''Yakko''': Say, what kind of game show is this?

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': This isn't a game show.

'''Yakko''': I'll say it isn't. Nobody wins anything. You'll be lucky to be on the air for one week!

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': *screaming* Nurse! Nurse!

'''[[Hello Nurse]]''': Yes, Dr. Scratchansniff?

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Get those kids out of here!

'''Yakko and Wakko''': Helloooo Nurse!

'''Yakko''': Hah... 

'''Wakko''': Huuh...

'''Dot''': Diiiisgusting!

'''Hello Nurse''': Why don't you cute little kids follow me? ''(Yakko and Wakko float towards Hello Nurse while Dot walks out the room)''

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': (narrating) After the Warner Brothers escaped, I was called to see the chairman of the board of the Warner Brothers studio.

'''Thaddeus Plotz''': [screaming] The Warner Brothers are wreaking havoc throughout the studio, Scratchansniff! And I won't have it! In order for a studio to run efficiently, there must be order, calmness, control. The Warner Brothers have taken the calmness and replaced it with chaos. They're too zany, Scratchansniff! I haven't been this upset since we made "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead". And I have chosen you to get the Warner Brothers under control.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Why me?

'''Thaddeus Plotz''': Because you're a psychiatrist, dummy.

[scene change]

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Oh... Und zo, I scheduled an appointment with the Warner Brothers. I'll never forget our first session... 

'''Hello Nurse''': The Warner Brothers are here for their 3:00 appointment. ''[Warners zoom inside the room]'' You be good little boys.

'''Yakko and Wakko''': Mmm. [Yakko and Wakko's tounges touch the ground; Dot walks over them and yanks both tounges, and lets go, causing the tounges to retract back inside their mouths.

'''Dot''': Boys.

'''Yakko''': How you doing, Scratchy?

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': I take umbrage at that.

'''Yakko''': Oh sure. Take all the umbrage. Don't leave any for us.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': No, I mean I take offence.

'''Yakko''': And you want our fence, too? ''[pulls out fence]'' All right, take it, but that's all, we're tapped out.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': I think it's time we got down to business, ja?

'''Yakko''': ''[Warners begin dancing in business suits]'' No-our first quater figures are really low as this-a business-a graph will hopefully show.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': What are you doing?

'''Yakko''': We're getting down... to business.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': You always make ze jokes. Zis is not good. No more jokes, ja...

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Yah. Good, now, plant yourselves on ze couch there.

'''Yakko, Wakko and Dot''': ''[turn into plant seeds and zoom towards the couch, planting themselves and rapidly growing into flowers] (more violin noises)''

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': I said, no more jokes!

'''Yakko''': This isn't a joke, it's a visual gag.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': Well, no more jokes, gags, or monkey stuff.

'''Yakko''': Define monkey stuff.

'''Dot''': Then you did a very good job.

'''Dr. Scratchansniff''': *screaming* I didn't draw it! *calms down* Doesn't it looks like a little kitty cat or a butterfly or something?

'''Dot''': No. ''[grabs inkblot and transforms it into a butterfly]'' ''That's'' a butterfly. ''[Dot chases the butterfly with a net and catches both the butterfly and Dr. Scratchansniff's head. Scene changes to Scratchansniff and Wakko].''
