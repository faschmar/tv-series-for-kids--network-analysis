<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko, Wakko and Dot:

It's time for Animaniacs

And we're zany to the max

So just sit back and relax.

You'll laugh till you collapse.

We're Animaniacs!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko and Wakko:

Come join the Warner Brothers

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot:

And the Warner Sister Dot

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko, Wakko and Dot:

Just for fun, we run around the Warner movie lot.

They lock us in the tower whenever we get caught.

But we break loose and then vamoose and now you know the plot.

We're Animaniacs

Dot is cute and Yakko yaks.

Wakko packs away the snacks

While Bill Clinton plays the sax

We're Animaniacs

Meet Pinky and the Brain who want to rule the universe.

Goodfeathers flock together, Slappy whacks them with her purse.

Buttons chases Mindy, while Rita sings a verse.

The writers flipped, We have no script, Why bother to rehearse?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>All:

We're Animaniacs

We have pay-or-play contracts

We're zany to the max

There's baloney in our slacks!

We're Animanie-

Totally insane-y

The rain in Spain-y

Animaniacs! Those are the facts!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Unknown person: He's a chicken, I tell ya. A giant chicken!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Thaddeus Plotz: Dr. Scratchansniff, do you know what keeps this studio running?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Err, your brilliant leadership, T.P?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Thaddeus Plotz: I mean besides that. What keeps this place going?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Mmmm... Mel Gibson movies?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Thaddeus Plotz: YES! That's it, sniff. And how do we pay for those movies? With money! money. And we need more. With that in mind, I've invited some powerful foreign investors to come here tomorrow. They'll prepare to give us 1 billion of it. Billion of it. 1 billion. 1 billion dollars! Do you know what that means?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Ja, that's a one with lots und lots of zeros after it.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Thaddeus Plotz: No! It means tomorrow is the most important day in the studio's history! I'm throwing a gala banquet on sound stage 10. Now every star in hollywood would be there. Investors will get the royal treatment, and we'll get the check. IF, it goes smoothly. There's just one catch. Before they invest, they wanna meet every one who works here. Including you.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Ooh, that's nice. I like to party.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Thaddeus Plotz: And including, the Warner Brothers.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko and Wakko: Hi, T.P

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: And the Warner Sister

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: No, T.P! Don't let the investors meet the warners! They're out of control. They're koo-koo! They're-

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Thaddeus Plotz: Your responsibility. You're the studio psychiatrist. You have 24 hours, Scratchansniff, to teach them some manners. I can't have those! Those! What are they?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: I don't know

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Thaddeus Plotz: Now I can't have them ruining this banquet! Understand?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Alright, I'll try.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Thaddeus Plotz: Trying is not good enough, Scratchansniff. DO IT!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Uh! Eh! Pleugh! (falls down) . Rggrgh! (change scene, on communication device), Bring me ze Warner Brothers. Wish me luck, Siggy.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Ralph T. Guard: (brings in box, runs out)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: (opens box using crowbar)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko (in harmony of the A7 chord): Hello

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: Doctor.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: Scratchansniff

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warnet trio (singing):

He asked a lot of questions, to find out what we think

He's Doctor Scratchansniff, the studio's shrink.

He says

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko:

How do you feel?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko and Dot:

We say with our hands.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko:

How do you stay together?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko and Dot:

We use rubber bands.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko:

I want to know your psyche

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko and Dot:

There's two inside our skull

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko:

Now what would you call that?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko and Dot:

A Bi-psyche-skull.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warner trio:

He knows our motivations, that's what he'd like to think,

He's Doctor Scratchansniff, the studio shrink!

(they all fling Dr. Scratchansniff into a wall with a circular motion)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff (spoken): Stop zat, Stop! Do you know why you're here?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: No-one really knows why we're here, doc, although Schopenhauer put forth an interesting theory.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: That is not what I meant! 

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: Then why'd you say it?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: You're misinterpreting!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: No, this is miss interpreting.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: This is miss understanding.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: And I'm mysterious.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: Ooh, a giant pez dispenser (Siggy?). Want one?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Please.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Stop playing with my bust!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: (kiss) Goodnight, everybody!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Be quiet please, I have something to tell you!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Ooh, story time

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: Get right to the scary part.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: What scary part?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: The part with my pet. (opens box, Dot's pet appears as giant crab with eyeball replacing its head)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: She is? Of course not. No, ze bad news is, you can only go if I train you to be polite, clean, well-dressed children on your best behavior.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: I thought you said it was a party!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Well, yes? or no?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warner Trio: (gibberish)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Well, what did you decide?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warner Trio: (exactly same gibberish as before)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Yes, or no?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warner Trio: Yes.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: (bows) How do, you do (shakes hand), that thing with your mouth? (lands in Hello Nurse's arms, kisses her) Take me away, but be gentle; I'm fragile. (Yakko fractures into many tiny pieces.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: No, no, it is impolite to be that personal. Wakko?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: I disagree.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: No, I want you to greet ze lady.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: (kisses Hello Nurse), Hello, Nurse!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Now, we will eat a practice meal, ja, und I will correct you as we go along. Begin

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warner Trio: (Drink soup, throw the plates away, then jump around stuffing themselves more than saiyans from dragon ball)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Doctor Scratchansniff: Don't eat with your hands! You must use the proper tools!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: (operates a dig machine as to dump food with a bigger total volume than Wakko into Wakko's mouth

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Stop zat, sit down! Do you want to go to the party, or not?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: You're not paying attention. You didn't hear any of that. You're not listening to anything I say!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Well, sure we are, doc. Let's review, shall we.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko (singing):

When you walk into a party, it's a formal universe.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warner Trio:

So you jump up on your host and with a kiss say hello, nurse!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Doctor Scratchansniff:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko:

Remember that good diction reflects so well on you,

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warner Trio:

So practice all your vowel sounds, by saying aeiou

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff (spoken): Ehuhuh. No. No! NO! I give up! It can't be done! Kaputski, you're not going to the party!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warner Trio: Not going to the party? Why?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dr. Scratchansniff: Why? WHY? Because you won't be polite, speak correctly, or say, how do you do?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: Oh that.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: You mean like this?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warner Trio: (dress up) How do, you do? (Dot does a curtzy, Yakko and Wakko bow)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Thaddeus Plotz: Ruin my studio, will you? You, you! You, whatever you are!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Female translator: Mr. Kato would like to know who is responsible for 'zis.
