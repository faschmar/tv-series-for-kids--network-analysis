== The Tiger Prince ==
<nowiki>*</nowiki>Intro:

Ahhh la wain-ya!

Ee-malla ee ya away!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Singers: 

Oom balla ee a walla ling goo

Ee oola coola yalla din doo

Oo day loo ee-a totta malla

I know eets joost a lota walla

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Singer:

Ever since we could think for ourselves

We've wondered what will happen to us

But it can't be foretold

What the future will hold

If you'll get rich

Or get hit by a bus.

The surprises in life

Keep us on our toes

Like a sock in the jaw

Like a punch in the nose

(Yakko climbs up the rock.)

They keep us guessing

They mix it up

The surprises

The surprises in life.

(Yakko hold the tiger prince over the edge of the rock, then drops it. The tiger yowls.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: (spoken) Ooh. I thought they were supposed to land on their feet.

== Theme Song ==
(music)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko, Wakko and Dot:

It's time for Animaniacs

And we're zany to the max

So just sit back and relax.

You'll laugh till you collapse.

We're Animaniacs!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko and Wakko:

Come join the Warner Brothers

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot:

And the Warner Sister Dot

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko, Wakko and Dot:

Just for fun, we run around the Warner movie lot.

They lock us in the tower whenever we get caught.

But we break loose and then vamoose and now you know the plot.

We're Animaniacs

Dot is cute and Yakko yaks.

Wakko packs away the snacks

We pay tons of income tax

We're Animaniacs

Meet Ralph and Dr. Schratchansniff, say hi to Hello Nurse

Goodfeathers flock together, Slappy whacks them with her purse.

Buttons chases Mindy, while Rita sings a verse.

The writers flipped, We have no script, Why bother to rehearse?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>All:

We're Animaniacs

We have pay-or-play contracts

We're zany to the max

There's baloney in our slacks!

We're Animanie-,

Totally insane-y...

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko:

Uhhhhhhhhhh

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners:

Animaniacs! Those are the facts!

(Yakko continues singing in background,)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: We’ll, there it is. Yakko Warner now well under way in singing all the words in the English language. I’m Dot Warner. With me is Dick Button. Dick, a good start?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dick: Oh, yes, Dot, a marvelous start to what is a difficult, difficult routine.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: Stay tuned, and we’ll be back to bring you the whole thing.

== The Kid in the Lid ==
<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: It was hotter than blazes, about 110. So we stayed in the house, in the air conditionin’. We just hung around, my sister and me. And watched countless hours of daytime TV. Too hot to go out, we’d melt in the sun. So we stared at the tube, which isn't much fun. All we could do was watch, watch, watch, watch, ‘til I spilled lots of soda all over my crotch. Then we heard a kaboom. That kaboom shook the room. We turned, and into our house something slid. A strange-looking fellow, the Kid in the Lid. And he said to us:

(Yakko comes in through a wall, destroying it.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Oops. Now look what I did. Now we all know it's hot, and you don't have a pool. But there are lots of fun things we can do that are cool. The first silly thing we can do…

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Said the kid.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Is play with some glue!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Said the kid in the lid.

(Yakko gets glue all over the walls.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Lots of wet glue, we’ll make a big mess. We'll glue things together, your parents will stress.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: But our parents were out, they were gone for a week. To be truthful they’d been gone for a 90-day streak. The last that we heard they were in the Bahamas, leaving us here to face childhood traumas. As for playing with glue, my sis said:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Mary: Let’s do it!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: “Kids need to have fun,” I shouted, “Let’s glue it!” But our pet woodchuck said:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Charlton: No, that kid has to leave. Open the door, and give him the heave. He doesn't seem normal, he doesn't seem well. Besides that, his pants have a real funny smell.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Hey, woodchuck, calm down, just relax.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Said the kid.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: It’s you who smells bad.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Said the kid in the lid.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: I bet you've not washed in at least seven months. So I strongly suggest that we bathe you at once. In the tub,

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Said the kid.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Goes the smelly woodchuck. (puts Charlton in tub) Use lots of shampoo to cut through all the muck.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Charlton: No, stop!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Yelled our woodchuck.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Charlton: Get me out of this tub!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: But as the water got deeper, out woodchuck went,

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Charlton: Blub!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: It’s okay.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Said the kid.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: I won’t let your drown. I won't let you drown. I'll pull on this chain so the water goes down. And the woodchuck goes too, and he goes down the drain. And comes out the potty in considerable pain.

(Charlton goes down the drain in the bathtub and comes out of the toilet bowl.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Then the toilet exploded, a messy disaster. The water rose up and wrecked all the plaster. It surged down the hallway and flooded the den.       It filled up the kitchen, and bedrooms, and then... It splashed out the door and into the street, where it provided relief from the afternoon heat. Kids came from all over to splash in the lake, not knowing the source was our potty break.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Mary: They’re swimming in water straight out of our toilet!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Think we should tell ‘em?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Nah, that’d just spoil it.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Charlton: Ooh, you’re gonna get it!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Said our woodchuck, upset.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Charlton: You ruined our house and got everything wet! I think you're insane. You’re rude and you're naughty! To make matters worse, I'm stuck in this potty!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Perhaps you should nap. You need sleep.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Said the kid. Then all of us watched as that kid closed the lid.

(Charlton speaks, muffled.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Then he went running off, and in less than an hour, the kid had come back with a small water tower.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: I’ve returned!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Said the kid.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: I've returned with this tower. It would have been sooner but I needed a shower.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Then he opened the top, and he shouted:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Let’s play!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Then out sprang two kids who responded:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko and Dot: Okay!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: These two are my sibs. They're fun, wait and see. May I proudly present Kid Two and Kid Three?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: They gave us a kiss, then said:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko and Dot: Hello nurse!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: The first kid was trouble, but these two seem worse! Hi, how ya doin’? That’s Mary, I’m Scooter. Kid Two looked at Mary then whispered:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: I’m cuter.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter:  Then they ran all around doing impossible feats, acting like kids who’ve had too many sweets. Kid three said:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: I’m hungry.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: His eyes started twitchin’. He shot out the room and ran into the kitchen. He opened the cupboards and then started chewing on cans of tomatoes and carrots for stewing. He gulped down the flour, some dry macaroni, three bottles of ketchup, and then Rice-A-Roni!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: The San Francisco Treat!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: He ate all the dishes, but didn't stop there. He swallowed the sink then our new Frigidare.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: Ahh! Hey, that was delicious, thanks for the snacks. I'm hypoglycemic, I get munchy attacks.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Then we heard a loud blast, and ran out the door. Those three crazy kids were now playing war!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Mary: Oh no! You must stop this!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Said Sis to Kid Two.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Mary: It’s this sort of playing you just must not do!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: I’m sorry, we can’t. It’s too late, we’ve begun. We always play war until somebody’s won.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Then the walls started cracking and the ceiling gave in. We ran out the door as the whole house caved in. Then, oh! what bad timing, for right then and there, our parents returned, so we said a quick prayer.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter and Mary: Don’t let them be angry.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: We said it again.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter and Mary: Don’t let them be angry. Oh, please, please, amen.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: Our parents were dazed, they stood there dumbfounded. As they looked at the damage we knew we'd be grounded.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Well, that was some fun, but enough for one day. Give us a call and we'll come back to play.

(The Warners leave, and the kids begin to cry. Wakko comes back and taps Scooter on the shoulder.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: Ha ha ha! We got ya!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: Yeah, we were just kiddin’

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: We’ll rebuild your house and paint it with Glidden.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: The San Francisco Treat!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Scooter: And that's what they did, and in less than a jiffy, the house was rebuilt, and it looked really spiffy. That night, we ate well. It had been quite a day. But now life was happy. It was all A-Okay.

(Charlton is still in the toilet.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Charlton: Hello? Hello? Anyone? Anybody? Can anyone hear me? I’m still in the potty!
