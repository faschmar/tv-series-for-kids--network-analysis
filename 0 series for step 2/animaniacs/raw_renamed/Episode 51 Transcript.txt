== Opening Segment ==
(Skippy walks down stairs)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Mornin', Skippy.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Skippy: Hi aunt Slappy, what's for breakfast?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: A brand new cereal from Smellogs, Branimaniacs. (Shows cereal)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Skippy: Wow, we're on the box!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: That's right, kiddo.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Skippy: Do we get paid for that?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: You don't... but just look at what's inside! (Pours contents into bowl, slow motion). Branimaniacs is chock-filled with tasty bran, crunchy fiber, natural roughage and...tiny sugar cubes shaped like my head. (Sets it onto table, milk, bacon, eggs and half a lemon) It's an important part of this balanced breakfast. So dig in, Skippy (pours milk on both's Branimaniacs)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Skippy: You bet! (Eats)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: And remember, to start your day with Branimaniacs for that get up and go feeling.

(Both eat cereal, gulp and get a gas sound effect. Then they open their eyes and look down.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Skippy: I gotta get up and go.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: I'll race ya.

(Both run, cut to Warners dancing next to giant cereal box)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners (singing):

Eat Branimaniacs.

Nutritionally, it lacks,

But this cereal attacks all of your digestive tracts,

It's Branimani

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: (In cover)

My stomach's in pain-y

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners:

Branimaniacs!

== Theme Song ==
(music)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko, Wakko and Dot:

It's time for Animaniacs

And we're zany to the max

So just sit back and relax.

You'll laugh till you collapse.

We're Animaniacs!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko and Wakko:

Come join the Warner Brothers

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot:

And the Warner Sister Dot

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko, Wakko and Dot:

Just for fun, we run around the Warner movie lot.

They lock us in the tower whenever we get caught.

But we break loose and then vamoose and now you know the plot.

We're Animaniacs

Dot is cute and Yakko yaks.

Wakko packs away the snacks

While Bill Clinton plays the sax

We're Animaniacs

Meet Pinky and the Brain who want to rule the universe.

Goodfeathers flock together, Slappy whacks them with her purse.

Buttons chases Mindy, while Rita sings a verse.

The writers flipped, We have no script, Why bother to rehearse?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>All:

We're Animaniacs

We have pay-or-play contracts

We're zany to the max

There's baloney in our slacks!

We're Animani,

Totally insane-y...

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot

Come back, Shane-y...

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners:

Animaniacs! Those are the facts!

== The Warners and the Beanstalk ==
<nowiki>*</nowiki>Narrator (From nighty-night toon): Once upon a time, in a land far, far away. No, much farther than that. (Change scene) No, further still. (Change scene) Uhh, here we are. Anyway. In this land far, far, far, far away, there was a village of poor, but happy people.

(Shows man with bison or ox walking down path, wagon)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Narrator: The villages were poor, because they were terrorized by a giant, who lived in the clouds.

(Giant steps on road, man screams and transport runs away.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: (Speaks like Ralph) Duh, vroom, vroom! Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh! Vroom! He he he he he heh! (Puts wagon in pocket, takes moose out of trees) All the dinky treasures of the world are mine! (Laughs, takes tree, uses it to dust house, and takes house from ground. People run away, screaming)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Narrator: Also in this village, lived the three Warners. The Warners were so poor, they had to sell their only possession. A dried up old cow.

(Cow breaks 4th wall, grunting.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: There's the used cow salesman now. Let me do the talking. (Dismounts cow) Excuse me, but would you be interested in buying our cow? Steers like a dream.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Salesman: Well, uhh... I don't know.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: How 'bout buying Wakko? (Holds Wakko up)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: Why me? (Sparkly eyes)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: 'Cause Dot gets more letters.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: (Writes signatures, puts them into letters, sees Wakko angry at her) I can't help it if I'm c-ute!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Salesman: Okay, tell ya what. I'll give ya a bean for that cow.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: (Gets in salesman's face) Bean, a bean? You should be ashamed of yourself. Why, she's worth at least, uhh... three beans.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Salesman: Deal. (Shakes hand, holds 3 beans)\

(Cow eats beans)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: There goes our 3 bean salad.

(Cow struggles, spits beans into hole. Beanstalk immediately starts grow.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Beans'll do that to ya.

(Warners scream, get pushed into the clouds. They get zipped into a bag, Yakko unzips, Wakko spits.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: huh. That's the last time I ever travel by bean.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: (Pokes Yakko's arm) Look! (Points to castle)

(Warners walk to castle)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Narrator: And sure enough, the Warners had arrived at the giant castle.

(Warners go to door)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Looks like Aaron Spelling's house

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Harp (singing):

Free me, free me,

Won't you rescue me?

The giant sleeps before he wakes,

Come in and rescue me

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko (Spoken): Are you pretty?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Harp: Yes!

(Yakko and Wakko look to each other excitedly.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: We'll be right there.

(Wakko drags grappling hook out of bag)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: Is there a handsome man in there too?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Harp: No.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: I'll wait out here.

(Wakko throws grappling hook onto inside, Yakko and Wakko pull rope down, making door fall down. Dot reads book before dragged inside by brothers. All walk and see the various objects the giant got earlier in the segment, around furniture.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: This must be Tory's dressing room.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Harp: Hello. Please save me.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko and Wakko: Hello, harp!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: She's a dream! (Floats up with cartoon hearts popping like bubbles.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: She's a pretend. (Ditto)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: She's a woman with a harp stuck to her back! Boys. (Sternly walks up leg of table)

(Wakko plays harp)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Harp: O-hohohoho, ohuh, that tickles! (Grips Yakko's chin) If you rescue me, you'll be greatly rewarded. I'll give you 4 beans, and a goose (points).

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: How lucky can we get (stern)?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Harp: (Grips Yakko's chin) Ooh, but this goose is very special. It lays golden eggs.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: A little fibre in its diet, and it won't do that anymore.

(Wakko picks up goose, looks under, puts it down again, confused. Shakes goose)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: It's broken.

(Goose gasps, poops out golden egg)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: (Joyously) I fixed it!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: (Wakes up, yawns)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Harp: Please, we must leave before the giant wakes. Lower me safely to the floor.

(Warners push harp off table, Harp screams.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners: 

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Harp: (Irritated, gasps, seeing giant)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: A-ha! I got teeny-weenies in my house! (Puts face at level of warners)

(Warners panic and shout. Dot points hand, Yakko babbles and bounces, Wakko spins, then revert.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners: (Calm, enthusiastic) Hi!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: (Grabs Warners, sniffs) Pee-pie-pooker-plut. I smell Yakko, Wakko and Dot.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Don't you mean phi-phy-pho-phum?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: Yeah, but it don't rhymes with Dot.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: You know, you really should pluck those unsightly nose hairs. (Picks hair out)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: Oow! Uh, dat smarted me!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: I doubt it.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: Now, I's gonna eat you teeny-weenies (puts on apron).

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Eat us?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: You don't wanna eat us?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: We taste awful

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners: Bleugh!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Hmm... (clicks)

(Warners discuss)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: We know what you want.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: You does?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners: Uh-huh.

(Wakko makes the goose poop out a golden egg, Yakko cracks it and pours contents in pan with heater, then shakes. Dot gets canned meat, out, drops it onto tiny plate while Yakko gets eggs there.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: I'm sure you'd love this, have a seat. Here's your meal, gold eggs and meat. (Imitates green eggs and ham)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: I does not like gold eggs and meat. It's you who I would like to eat. (Puts Warners in container)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: (Comes out of cupboard) Would you like them a la mode?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: Would you like them with a toad?

(Toad croaks out of Wakko's had)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: I would not like them a la mode. I would not like them with a toad. I does not like gold eggs and meat. It's you who I would like to eat.

(Wakko changes scene, Giant is on small platform, rain and thunder.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: Would you eat them with a cod?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Holding up a metal rod?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: I woulds not eat them with a cod, holding up a metal rod.

(Giant electrocuted by lightning, falls off)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: I does not like gold eggs and meat. It's you who I would like to eat.

(Giant stands on San Andreas Fault

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dot: How 'bout with a dash of salt?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: On the San Andreas fault?

(Fault widens, Giant falls down.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: No, not with a dash of salt, on the San Andreas fault. I does not like gold eggs and meat. It's you who I would like to eat. (Annoyed, sad)

(Scene changes, people run)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wakko: Would you, could you, in Japan?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: With godzilla and rodan?

(Godzilla and rodan surround Giant)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: I would not, could not in Japan, with godzilla and rodan (pushes both away).

(Giant gets flamed by godzilla, whacked far away by rodan, slams into ground)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: (Tired) I will not eat gold eggs and meat. It's-

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners: Us that you would like to eat.

(Change scene, onto cloud of castle)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: Eat them, eat them on a cloud.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: Oh, alright for crying out loud. (Takes and eats) Mmm. Gold eggs and meat, I do not hate.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: But now those clouds won't hold your weight.

(Giant sinks)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: Gee, I never thought about that.

(Giant falls, slams into ground forcing surface into a hole)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Giant: (Dazed) Phi-phy-pho-phum. I fall down and hurt my bum. (Falls over in hole)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Narrator: And so, with the giant gone, the poor village became a wealthy suburb.

(Same man with jewellery rides to cow trade, waves mutually. Harp and Warners on stage.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Narrator: And the heroic Warners were richly rewarded for saving the village.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Mayor: As mayor of the village of the happy and rich, I am proud to present the three Warners with... (reaches in pocket) five beans, and Merv Griffin's autograph.

(Applause, Yakko given items.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yakko: (Annoyed) Doesn't anyone ever get cash in fairytales?

== Slappy the Squirrel intro ==
<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners (singing):

The crankiest of creatures in the whole wide world, our next cartoon features Slappy the Squirrel.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: (Opens door, spoken) E-nough with the singing, already. (Slams door)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Warners (singing):

That's Slappy!

== Frontier Slappy ==
(Music. Kentucky Wilderness, 1767. Two bunnies snuggle, then gasp when tree falls. It crashes just after they escape. Bees escape as a music comes and a man drives using animals. The man cuts a tree down.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Trio (singing):

Daniel Boone was a great, big guy,

Yes, a really big guy.

He knocks down trees and frightens off bees,

(Vehicle knocks trees, which turns into stumps and bees fly away.)

So they'll cry

(Daniel Boone gets axe, jumps out)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Ken-tucky at last! I'm gonna build me a little log cabin right here. Then a log-cabin for my oxes. Then a summer cabin! The only thing I love more than building cabins is chopping down trees. (Cuts down tree) Birch is good wood for clothes pins. (Cuts down tree) This oak'll make a dandy shelf. (Cuts down 5 oak trees) Well I'll be kissed by a wolverine. A (incomprehensible). That's best wood around for making a front door.

(Singing)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Trio:

Daniel Boone saw a great big tree.

An attractive tree,

But he didn't know it was home to a squirrel

Named Slappy.

(Slappy and Skippy put candles above pot)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Skippy (spoken):

How come we're making so many candles, aunt Slappy?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Skippy, it's the 1700's. What'd ya expect, roller blading?

(Periodic smashes)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Skippy: What's that?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Maybe my colon. I hope not. I'll go find out

(Daniel seen swinging axe and hitting Slappy's tree.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Hey, you break this tree, you're gonna pay for it.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Lookie here you old squirrel, I'm Daniel Boone! The best frontiersman that ever lived.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Well I'm Slappy Squirrel, and I'm so old my blood is solid (pats arm). What are you doing to my tree?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Uh, fixing and making it into the front door of my cabin. Now get, or I'll make a cap outta ya!

(Slappy slams door)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Uh, I got yer cap right here. (Walks away)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: (Continues chopping) Huh. No old squirrel's gonna stand between me and my cabin!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: (Holds pot of hot wax, bubbling) Excuse me there Boone. Is there any chance you might find another tree.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: No!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: I was hoping you'd say that. (Pours wax)

(Candles are on Daniel Boone's covered body.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Maybe he can rent himself out as a Menorah. (Chuckles)

(Scene change)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Trio:

Daniel Boone had a great, big plan.

Yes, a very large plan,

(Daniel ties rope on house, connected to ox)

He'd fix that squirrel by yanking her tree-house

From the land.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Pull, you lazy good fer nothing critters! (Slaps ox)

(Oxes pull)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Reckon this'll teach that old squirrel that I'm the king of the wilderness. (Sees rope fall down) Huh?

(Ox hold up strike signs, Slappy holds up Dray Animals Local 809)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Whaddaya say, we won't dray, what we want is an 8 hour day.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: (Angry) What in blazes are you doing?!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Call me Norma Rae, or Barbara(?) Rae, but I unionized your team.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Get up and yank down that tree ya dumb slabs o' hide!

(Ox get angry, Daniel makes cute face, laughs. Ox whack Daniel with signs into ground, hat pops up.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Ox: Management

(Oxes walk away, scene change where Daniel is in bush, walks to house.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Trio:

Daniel Boone had another big plan,

Yes, a crafty plan,

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Shh! (Laughs) I'm gonna get that squirrel my famous panther call (moves). She'll think a for real panther is comin', and run out of that tree like a fat badger (laughs). (Makes hissing call)

(Slappy stirs wax in thin barrel with rod)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Skippy: (sarcastic) Gee aunt Slappy, a panther.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: You think so? Maybe we better run for our lives here.

(Daniel makes another call, Slappy exits house with wax barrel, slams door and spreads wax on floor around Daniel.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: I'm running away like a fat badger.

(Daniel smiles, but hears real panther growl, and then roar. Daniel runs away on wax, but gets caught and fights, panther continues growling.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Eck! Ow, woah, panther!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: The panther's in my bridge club.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Trio:

Daniel Boone was very, very sore.

Yes, painfully sore,

He picked up a log and charged

Slappy squirrel's front door.

(Daniel Boone does that, but Slappy opens door and trips Daniel with umbrella. Daniel flies into spinning wheel, crashes out again. Slappy closes door.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Skippy: Who was that, aunt Slappy?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Maybe a flying Wallenda. I'm not sure, my eyes are bad (puts fingers around eyes).

(Daniel slams into tree and then ground, dazed.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Daniel Boone was a great big guy.

(Daniel puts on Acme bird costume)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Trio:

Daniel Boone was a big dang bird.

Yes, a really big bird,

But he didn't know that his disguise

Was pretty absurd.

(Daniel runs)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: QUIET! You dead gum idiots, this is a dang good disguise. (Laughs) That old squirrel will think I'm just a big woodpecker. I'll chop down this here tree right in front of her. (Pecks tree with nose-cone)

(Slams)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Uh, there's no rest for the elderly. (Open door) Hey, are you Daniel Boone?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Shoot, no, I'm a big woodpecker.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Get outta here with that woodpecker thing, there. You're Boone!

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: No, I ain't. My daddy was a big woodpecker, and his daddy before him. Can't you see how I'm a... pecking at your tree for bugs and such? (Makes cute face)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: I guess you really are a big woodpecker.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Dang straight.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Then here, I made you some woodpecker lunch. (Pulls cloth, revealing bugs, dungbeetles.)

(Daniel turns green, groans.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: That's right, neighborly of ya, ma'am. (Eats bug.)

(Daniel turns yellow)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Yeah, there's nothing like dead bugs mixed with manure and served on a big piece of rotten bug, eh woody?

(Daniel gasps, covers mouth and runs.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Trio:

Daniel Boone was a great big guy,

(Slappy dances to music)

Yes, a big sick guy,

He lost his lunch all over,

The trees and sky.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: That's nice singin'. They remind me of Up With People.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Trio:

Daniel Boone was a great big jerk,

(Daniel goes underground, puts explosives under tree.)

Yes, a stupid jerk,

He had another dumb plan

That more than likely wouldn't work

(Daniel gets irritated by singing)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: That ties it! You boys are fired! Come on down from there, and get!

(Trio comes down from ladder)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Man 1: Hey, what's the big idea? You can't just fire us.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Man 2: Yeah, who do you think you are?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Man 3: Ey, we got rights, you know.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Man 2:Wait a second,

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Man 3: We got a contract.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Man 1: Our agent said- 

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Man 2: Yeah-

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Man 1/2/3: (Incomprehensible)/Yeah, my agent said the same thing. Come on, this is ridiculous./(Incomprehensible)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: I said get! I'm gonna blow this here tree and that old squirrel sky high, and I don't need no dang smart aleck chorus!

(Trio goes up ladder, while Boone makes trail of gunpowder up ladder. Lights match)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: If I can't have that tree, then nobody's gonna have it! (Lights gunpowder, goes in wagon, laughs) Now there's gonna be a big hole in the ground. I could make it into a rootseller, or a... fruitseller.

(Fire goes down ladder, wagon explodes into the sky.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: (Comes out) Hey Boone, I moved all yer gunpowder. It was attracting ants.

(Daniel flies, Earth shot)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel: Oy, ey-ey! Shoot, dang, OH! (Falls into ground)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: Yeesh! Bet that left a crater.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Skippy: What'cha wanna do tonight, aunt Slappy?

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: How 'bout a little music, Skippy? Hit it, boys!

(Trio sways, about to sing)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Trio (singing):

Slappy squirrel is a grand old dame,

Yes, a very old dame.

She whipped Daniel Boone, now she pays us

To sing of her fame.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slappy: What can I say, I love the lyrics.
