{{L|''[Starts off with people surfing. Then shows Chad Nelsen.]''}}
{{L|Chad Nelsen|I love just about everything about the beach. It's been a- It was really a part of my childhood. It was a place to meet friends, socialize, and have fun on the surf and on the sand.}}
{{L|Matt McClain|I'll tell ya,you know what's not to love about the beach? The beach is one of those places that I think that, it's impossible to not have a great say at. You come down here and the sand is warm, and the water is cool.}}
{{L|Steve Pezman|And you can stand at the edge, and think that it goes all the way to China and all the way to Africa, and it goes around the world.}}
{{L|''[Switches to a scene in The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie, where SpongeBob and Patrick are on a beach.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh no! How will we ever get back to Bikini Bottom?}}
{{L|''[Switches back to Matt]''}}
{{L|Matt McClain|Approximately, two thirds of our nation's population lives within 500 miles of the beach, so all of the pollution, and run-offs, and sometimes toxic materials, end up in our beaches and coastal waters. You can come down and go swimming in the ocean and some cases, get sick just for going in the water.}}
{{L|''[Switches to a scene in The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie, showing Mindy]''}}
{{L|Mindy|Eww!}}
{{L|''[Switches back to Steve]''}}
{{L|Steve Pezman|Everything that we do, has a cause an effect. So when someone dumps something bad in a drainage in the mountains, it washes down and empties out in the ocean.}}

{{L|''[Switches back to Chad]''}}
{{L|Chad Nelsen|Often the Mississippi River, in the Gulf of Mexico there's what they call a "dead zone", that's the size of New Jersey. This is an area where there is nothing living anymore, and the reason that "dead zone" is there is cause all the pollution collected in the Mississippi River, is ending up in the Gulf of Mexico. While offshore, that water in the ocean evaporates, and comes into cloud, and forms rain clouds, and comes back to the coast.}}
{{L|Steve Pezman|So what happens in Kansas, effects the Gulf of Mexico. And what happens in the Gulf of Mexico, effects the plains of Kansas.}}
{{L|''[Switches to a scene in The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie, where Mindy is talking to SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|Mindy|See, you can't quit. The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands.}}
{{L|''[Switches back to Steve]''}}
{{L|Steve Pezman|Surfrider Foundation is a group of surfers, and ocean scientists, and concerned citizens, who have banded together to protect the ocean.}}
{{L|Matt McClain|What we try to do, is address things such as water quality, beach access, and beach preservation, to make sure that for generations to come, we have plentiful beaches, safe beaches for people to go to.}}
{{L|''[Switches to a scene in The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie, where King Neptune is talking to SpongeBob, while SpongeBob is in his hand.]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|You're just a kid}}
{{L|''[King Neptune throws SpongeBob to the ground.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But I'm not a kid. I can do it.}}
{{L|''[Switches back to Steve.]''}}
{{L|Steve Pezman|The most important thing, if you want to become an involved person in saving the ocean, would be to become informed, and understand what the issues are in your area, and then begin to contribute to making it better.}}
{{L|Chad Nelsen|By using less toxic herbicides, and pesticides, and cleaners in their house, making sure that their cars aren't leaking oil. All these little things add up to cause the problem, so each of us can take these little steps to protect the environment.}}
{{L|Matt McClain|And that makes a big difference. If everybody did that, our beaches would be a lot whole cleaner.}}
{{L|''[Switches to a scene in The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie, where Mr. Krabs is talking to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, me boy, I'm sorry I ever doubted you. That's a mistake I won't make again.}}
{{L|''[Switches back to Chad]''}}
{{L|Chad Nelsen|For a long time, we sort of believed that the ocean was so big that we couldn't really affect it. And now we're realizing that, on a global scale, we're having impacts to the ocean environment. And that's unfortunate. The good news is, is that there's an increasing awareness about these problems, and people being more conscious about pollution issues, about coastal development, and really recognizing that we need to pay attention and cherish our coastal environments, and not take them for granted.}}
