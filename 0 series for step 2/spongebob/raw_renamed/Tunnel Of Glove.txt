{{L|''[Pans in on Glove World!]''}}
{{L|Nancy Suzy Fish|Pearl, come on! The line for the Tunnel of Glove is filling up! This is going to be so, totally like, fun!}}
{{L|''[Pearl, Debbie, and Nancy walk into SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Pearl!}}
{{L|Pearl|Barnacles, SpongeBob, why are you talking to me?}}
{{L|Nancy|Is that your boyfriend?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I am a boy, and I am her friend. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Nancy and Debbie|''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Nancy|SpongeBob! Stand here for a second! ''[moves SpongeBob next to Pearl]''}}
{{L|''[camera flash and sound effect]''}}
{{L|Nancy|''[giggles]''}}
{{L|Debbie|''[holds her camera]'' Just thought we should keep this moment for... posterity. ''[shows Nancy]''}}
{{L|Nancy and Debbie|''[both giggle]'' Pearl's got a boyfriend! Pearl's got a boyfriend! Pearl's got a boyfriend!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[to SpongeBob]'' I didn't know you had a girlfriend.}}
{{L|Pearl|Quiet! He is not my boyfriend!}}
{{L|Patrick|That was fast. ''[to SpongeBob]'' Don't worry, buddy. There's plenty of fish in the street car.}}
{{L|Nancy|Anyway, let's go to the ride!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Bye, Pearl! Tell Mr. Krabs I said "Hi," Let's bounce Patrick. Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[eating cotton candy at a stand]'' Busy, I'll catch up with you later.}}
{{L|''[Goes to the "Tunnel of Glove"]''}}
{{L|Man|''[opens the metal gate to the ride boats]'' Next!}}
{{L|Nancy|''[walks through with Debbie]'' Come on, Pearl!}}
{{L|Man|''[holds his hand out]'' Sorry, only two per car. You'll have to wait for the next car. ''[to the line]'' Any single riders come to the front!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! I'm a single rider! ''[walks through the line]'' Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, pardon me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[holds his hands out to direct Pearl into the car]'' After you, fellow single rider Pearl.}}
{{L|Pearl|''[groans]''}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to boat riding]''}}
{{L|Intercom System|Please keep your arms and legs inside at all times. And do not leave the boat until the ride, is over. Thank you!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uhm, Pearl. Your arm... it's outside the boat.}}
{{L|Pearl|Ugh, I will put my arm in the boat. But don't touch me, don't talk to me, don't even look at me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[zips his mouth and eyes shut]''}}
{{L|''[The boat enters the tunnel. After about 6 seconds, Pearl begins to get bored]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Boring!}}
{{L|''[Camera turns to a metal person]''}}
{{L|Metal Angel|Will my arrow find her heart?}}
{{L|Pearl|Ugh, this ride is lame! Hey! You're allowed to speak now!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[unzips his eyes and mouth; quickly]'' I bet Mr. Krabs would get a kick out of this ride, don't you think? I mean he's so tough on the outside, but he's got a soft side, too. You know, this one time I was upset because my snail Gary he was sick and he let me leave five minutes early. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever heard? ''[his mouth becomes a megaphone and he speaks gibberish]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Two very boring minutes later...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And then, there was that time that Mr. Krabs yelled at me for getting to work before he did, and he didn't even dock my pay. What a sweet man!}}
{{L|''[Pearl gets very annoyed and even more bored]''}}
{{L|Pearl|''[screams]'' You are making this ride even more boring! Is such a thing is possible!}}
{{L|''[Pearl begins to climb out of the boat, but SpongeBob tries to stop her]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're supposed to remain seated until the ride's come to a complete- ''[now launched up onto the ceiling and knocks over a few hearts. One lands in the water. SpongeBob lands next to a stunned Pearl]'' Stop! ''[one of the hearts lands in one of the ride's controls, jamming it. Then, the ride stops]''}}
{{L|Pearl|What was that?!}}
{{L|Voice over microphone|Attention sweethearts! We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain seated.}}
{{L|''[Pearl then becomes frustrated]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Oh, great! Just great!}}
{{L|French Narrator|Three hours later...}}
{{L|''[Scene changes to policemen, thousands of people, and a helicopter surrounding the ride as if someone was being held hostage]''}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Breaking News! The Tunnel of Glove has turned into a Tunnel of Terror! Just hours ago, the mechanism that controls the boats mysteriously stopped, trapping the doomed couple inside. We have the youth's friends here, who escaped the tunnel before tragedy befell the two sweethearts.}}
{{L|Nancy|''[crying]'' It's true! We barely escaped with our lives! It was horrible!}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|And what was the name of your friends?}}
{{L|Nancy|''[still crying]'' Pearl, and her boyfriend SpongeBob! ''[she and Debbie both walk away giggling]''}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|So there you have it. As time quickly runs out ''[scene zooms out to a big screen with Patrick sitting next to it eating a whole bunch of junk food]'' still no word from the imperiled whale girl and SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[startled]'' Oh, no! I'm out of coral on a stick! ''[throws his stick away]'' Time to chomp through the fried barnacles!}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|''[starts talking as Patrick continues to eat]'' At this time survival looks bleek, for the little yellow sponge.}}
{{L|Patrick|Nooooooo! This is my worst nightmare! I don't have a drink!}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|''[talks to Patrick]'' Hey, doofus!}}
{{L|Patrick|Huh?}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Your best buddy is trapped in the tunnel of glove and he may never escape!}}
{{L|Patrick|You mean SpongeBob?}}
{{L|''[Scene changes to Patrick walking on top of the line to the entrance to the tunnel]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm coming, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|Policeman|Hold it! No one beyond this point!}}
{{L|Patrick|My best buddy is trapped in there! You gotta let me through!}}
{{L|Policeman|No can do, big guy. Too dangerous.}}
{{L|Patrick|Fine! ''[walks away. When he goes to the ground, the people give him an angry look]'' Well, mister police guy won't let me in the front, huh! Well, I'll just find my own way in!}}
{{L|''[Scene changes to the Glove World Power Plant with Patrick at the front door]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Let's see. Where could SpongeBob be? ''[notices the door sign]'' Aha! ''[reads dumbly when it says Danger! Keep Out! High voltage area]'' Con-grat-ulations! You have-uh-ooh-fouuunnd-uh your friend! ''[now excited]'' Oh, SpongeBob is right behind this door! I'm coming to get you, buddy! ''[runs away, then comes back using his head as a battering ram. Once inside, he then looks around]'' SpongeBob?! Where-? Oh, there you are! ''[the camera zooms in on a control that looks like SpongeBob. Patrick runs to it and grabs it]'' Hang in there! I'll free you from your shackles! ''[pulls it off, and bursts through the left wall]'' You're okay now, buddy! Go to your happy place! ''[Back inside, sparks begin to fly, and then the wires explode, causing the lights in the tunnel to turn off. SpongeBob screams in fear, a police officer hears them and pulls out a megaphone]''.}}
{{L|Police Officer|Don't worry, little girl! We're working as fast as we can!}}
{{L|Pearl|That wasn't me, that was SpongeBob!}}
{{L|Policeman|Thank you, little boy! ''[Pearl growls]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's okay, Pearl, it's only the dark. There's nothin' scary about... the dark! It's what's in the dark you gotta watch out for. ''[scared]'' Monsters, creeps, ghouls, clowns, witches, werewolves, clowns, crawly things, crawly clowns, those are the worst! The crawly clowns!}}
{{L|Pearl|Well, whatever, SpongeBob, I'm gonna find my way out! ''[gets out of the boat]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Pearl! I wouldn't do that! You're not keeping your arms and legs inside the boat! Pearl! Wait! I should probably accompany you, ya know, in case there's anything in the darkness.}}
{{L|Pearl|Fine. After you. ''[puts her arm in front]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, then. I'll just fearlessly lead the way... ''[touches the streamers, then screams and hides behind Pearl]'' Snakes!}}
{{L|Pearl|Those are streamers, fool!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[climbs on top of Pearl]'' Maybe I'll just stay up here... keep an eye out for any other creepies.}}
{{L|Pearl|Oh, grow up, SpongeBob! ''[slides SpongeBob off her head]'' There aren't any creepies, there aren't any crawlies, there aren't any snakes! So stop whining so we can look for a way out of here!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, Pearl, you've made your point. I'll stop talking about ogres, and vampire bat fish, and sharks, and...}}
{{L|Pearl|SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|...And I won't talk about zombies! ''[whimpers]''}}
{{L|Pearl|''[scared]'' SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[dressed as a pirate]'' Or ghostly pirates!  ''[Pearl starts being scared, SpongeBob is dressed like a Frankenstein Monster]'' Or laboratory creatures!}}
{{L|Pearl|''[gasps]'' SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks like an alien]'' Or green beings from another planet!}}
{{L|Pearl|Okay, SpongeBob. Okay.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks like an unshaven person with a full head of black hair]'' Or bus drivers!}}
{{L|Pearl|Ah, that's enough! ''[cries]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Shhh. Did you hear that?}}
{{L|Pearl|Now I'm scared, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It sounded like a crawly were-clown.}}
{{L|Pearl|But there's no such thing!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, he's here.}}
{{L|''[A Cupid swings by]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Pearl|''[scream and jump into the boat and SpongeBob gets hit in the head by a toilet plunger]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[chuckles weakly]''}}
{{L|''[Scene shows to Patrick and the SpongeBob-shaped control]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Not another skunk! How did you beat me again? ''[turns to an electrician]'' Hey you! You find it funny to lock up my friend? Hey, I am talking towards you.}}
{{L|Electrician|Did you see the dimwit who ripped this apart?}}
{{L|Patrick|I unfortunately don't know who that dullard is, but I do know that you've kidnapped SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Electrician|I don't know about your friend. I'm just the electrician. ''[light turns on]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Wow! I see you are a magician. But that voodoo does not erase what you just have done.}}
{{L|Electrician|You need to relax. Have a seat and cool off.}}
{{L|Patrick|Geez. Some people are so pushy. ''[sits on the lever]''}}
{{L|Electrician|Just don't sit on the lever!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oof. ''[breaks the lever]''}}
{{L|Electrician|Now the whole ride is stuck on "Dangerous Super Fast Mode"!}}
{{L|Patrick|You told me to sit on it.}}
{{L|''[Scene shows the inside of the Tunnel of Glove. The boat moves quickly. SpongeBob and Pearl scream]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's that sound?}}
{{L|Pearl|I don't know. Hold me, SpongeBob}}
{{L|Both|''[scream]'' Huh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey. The Hall of Great Romance!}}
{{L|''[Scene shows the Glove World Power Plant]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay, okay. I think I heard you. I will not sit on anything else. I'll just gingerly lean on this wall. ''[leans on a do not push button, which reads "Animatronic Override"]''}}
{{L|Electrician|Noooooooooooooooo!}}
{{L|''[Scene skips to the inside of the tunnel]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! How romantical.}}
{{L|Pearl|Pssssst. I imagined it bigger. ''[robot Anthony's head explodes]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Look! Pearl, a sweet adorable cherub. ''[The cherub's head explodes, then the cherub shoots its arrow]'' Pearl. I don't think this is the Tunnel of Glove. It's the Tunnel of Evil! ''[the rest of the Robot heads explode and walk towards SpongeBob and Pearl, they both shiver in fear]'' Pearl!}}
{{L|''[Scene skips to the Glove World Power Plant]''}}
{{L|Electrician|''[grunts]'' Stupid kid.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[walks out of the water pressure control system with toilet paper on his leg and a newspaper on his hand. The toilet paper slides back]'' Hi-yah. Nice facilities. Great water pressure. ''[the toilet paper slides back to the room that says Glove World Pumping Station]''}}
{{L|Electrician|Neptune's mother! ''[realizing that there is extreme water pressure]''}}
{{L|''[Scene skips to the inside of the Tunnel of Glove]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Pearl|''[frightened]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's that noise?! ''[a torrent of water comes out from the tunnel that pushes them towards a waterfall. An evil robot pops out, scaring them some more. They fall off the waterfall and get sucked in the drain]''}}
{{L|Both|''[screaming some more]''}}
{{L|''[The evil robots slide down the waterfall]''}}
{{L|''[Scene skips to outside the Tunnel of Glove]''}}
{{L|Police Man|She's gonna blow! Noooooo! ''[fish run away from the tunnel]''}}
{{L|Other Fish|''[scream as the Tunnel of Glove bursts and the boat SpongeBob and Pearl are in breaks]''}}
{{L|Pearl|I guess that turned out to be... kinda fun.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah.}}
{{L|Nancy and Debbie|''[laugh at SpongeBob and Pearl]''}}
{{L|Nancy|SpongeBob is your boyfriend.}}
{{L|Pearl|''[knocks SpongeBob out of the seat]'' Eww! How many times to I have to say it? Eww! Gross!}}
{{L|Nancy|Oh, don't deny it. You were totally hugging him, and everyone knows that totally means he's totally your boyfriend.}}
{{L|Crawly Clown|''[laughs]'' Howdy, kids!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams]'' Crawly clown! Crawly clown!}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Nancy, and Debbie|''[screaming horrified]''}}
{{L|Pearl|''[takes a picture, then laughs]'' You understand, girls. For posterity! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[Scene skips to Patrick and the SpongeBob-shaped control]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Are you gonna finish that?}}
