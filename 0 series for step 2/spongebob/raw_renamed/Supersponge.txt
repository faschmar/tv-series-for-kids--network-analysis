Today he is in search of the Best Birthday Present ever, for his best friend Patrick. The question is how far he go for his best friend?}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Gary, I just had a great idea about what to get Patrick for his birthday!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Ohhh no, not you again. Just keep the noise down. What do you want?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's my best friend Patrick's birthday and a signed photo of his favorite superheroes would be the best thing ever!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Well we are a bit busy right now., no rest for superheroes! Well, I know that Mermaid Man might consider signing one for a superhero snack.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|...sea-nut butter... ...tomatoes... ...jelly...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Like a calculator, you can count on it!}}
{{L|Gary|Meow!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi Squidward! Ready for another great day together, friend?}}
{{L|Squidward|Today's Sunday, SpongeBob. Forget the Krusty Krab. Hey moron, why don't you take your net and go waste somebody else's time!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, I can use this net to catch jellyfish and throw them at those annoying critters!}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob you silly 'ol sponge, try using your helmet!!!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yippee... Now to find the Kelp Lettuce... Off to Fish Hooks Park! Now to find the Bread. But where? I know! Bikini Bottom has loads of bread!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Zzzzzzzzzz.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Zzzzzzzzzz.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Oops!}} 
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Back already?...That is definitely a sandwich fit for a super hero! Gonna need to think of something to test your super hero potential, and keep busy! Look MM is not in great super hero condition at the moment and he could really do with some pampering!! Some Kelp cream and a facial! Not for me you understand!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm on my way! With this coral blower, I can suck up all those sea shells laying around, and use them to break the rock walls!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! Now listen boy! I'm countin' on ya to use this ere coral blower to make your way around Bikini Bottom!!! And watch out for some scurvy Plankton he is up to his old tricks again!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmmmm, using the coral blower on those rocks up there should cover up those spikes! then Gary Can Walk over them. Te-heee-hee! How Gary, follow me, I'll protect you!! Just head for your food Gary! Yippee... Now to find the Loofah... This has to be in Thermal Tunnels!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey SpongeBob. I got an extra balloon for my birthday. Want it? Oh, you're floating away! Hey, where'd my balloon go? SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Bubbles! Hey, I wonder if I can jump on them... Now to find the Mud Pack... off to those nasty Acrid Air Pockets, better make sure I'm nice and moist! I can make bubbles! And what do you know, I can jump on them! Now to find the False Teeth.... only in the lava fields, better pack some ice - it's gonna be a hot one! Right! Now back to Mermaid Man to receive my new orders! Ah!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|That is amazing, how did you manage that!! Reflecto has nothing on you kid, you must really love your mate, Trevor!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Whatever! Look we could do with some new uniforms? So how about you pop back to pre-historic Bikini Bottom to see what you can find!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|By the power of Neptune, and the use of Plankton's Time Machine I shall go through time!}}
{{L|Plankton|Blast you SpongeBreath, you have my secret time machine! Whatever you do make sure you fill it up before you bring it back!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This floor doesn't look too stable. A good ol' butt bounce should do the trick.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! Now listen Boy! There are dangerous surfaces that none shall pass unless they have squeaky boots. I happen to have a pair. You can owe me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now to find the Scallop Bra, the only place is Desert Wasteland. But what if I get stuck in quicksand! Like that's gonna happen!!}} 
{{L|Sandy|Hai yah! Excellent! You'll be able to use this move on most of the enemies you encounter, as well as special objects.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now to find a pair of Shell slippers..... and in to Kelp Jungle! A few more bubbles should get me up there...}}
{{L|Patrick|Da da da da da dum dum dum dumâ€¦ here you go, SpongeBob! One bubble wand dipped and ready to go! Up, down and all around! I don't know what that means.}}

Who could be eating all these Kandy bars...? I've got a kandy bar for ym favorite Super Hero! Mmh that's funny? Oh I know!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Mmh! Thanks kid. Look kid MM has a turn, the TV has broken and unless you get the right tools he is gonna miss his favorite cartoon. Can you help?}}
