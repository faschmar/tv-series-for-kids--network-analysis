{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You... did not... get... the job.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But... But why?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook, but I gave the job to Squidward because being manager is a big responsibility. Well, let's face it, he's more... mature than you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm not... mature?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Lad, I mean this in the nicest of ways, but there's a word for what you are, and that word is... now, let's see...}}

{{L|Jimmy|Wing nut.}}
{{L|Mable|A Knucklehead McSpazatron!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|OK, that's enough! Look, what I'm trying to say is, you're just a kid. And to be a manager, you have to be a man. Otherwise they'd call it "kid-ager." You understand-ager? I mean, you understand?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I guess so, Mr. Krabs.}}

{{L|King Neptune|So, you have confessed to the crime of touching the king's crown?}}
{{L|Prisoner|Yes, but...}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[angrily]'' But what?!}}
{{L|Prisoner|But it's my job, Your Highness. I'm the royal crown polisher.}}
{{L|King Neptune|Well, then I guess I can't execute you. Twenty years in the dungeon it is.}}
{{L|Mindy|Daddy! ''[Frees the crown polisher]'' You're free to go.}}
{{L|Crown Polisher|Bless you, Princess Mindy. ''[runs away]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|Mindy! How dare you defy me!}}
{{L|Mindy|Why do you have to be so mean?}}
{{L|King Neptune|I am the king! I must enforce the laws of the sea.}}
{{L|Mindy|Father, I wish you'd try a little love and compassion instead of these harsh punishments.}}
{{L|Squire|That would be nice. ''[Neptune hits him on the head with his trident]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|Squire. Clear the room! I wish to speak to my daughter alone. ''[Everyone except Neptune and Mindy leave. Neptune then shows Mindy his crown]'' What is this, Mindy?}}
{{L|Mindy|Your crown?}}
{{L|King Neptune|And what does this crown do?}}
{{L|Mindy|It covers your bald spot.}}
{{L|King Neptune|It's not bald! It's... thinning. This crown does much more than cover a slightly receding hairline. ''[Puts the crown on a pillow on a stool. While his back is turned, Plankton peeks out from behind the crown, snickering evilly]'' No, this crown entitles the one who wears it to be in charge of the sea. One day, you will wear this crown.}}
{{L|Mindy|''[Alarmed]'' I'm gonna be bald?!}}
{{L|King Neptune|Thinning! Anyway, the point is, you won't wear it until you learn how to rule with an iron fist. Like your father. ''[He reaches for his crown, but puts the pillow on his head instead.]''}}
{{L|Mindy|Dad, your "crown"...}}
{{L|King Neptune|What the...!? ''[Discovers that his crown is missing]'' My crown! ''[screams]'' Someone has stolen the royal crown!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[We see him leaving the castle with the crown]'' I got it! I got it! ''[He flies past Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat, which we get a view of inside. The bar is filled with people eating ice cream. Suddenly, a Goofy Goober Clock speaks]''}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Wait!}}
{{L|King Neptune|Nahhh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm flattered you would do this on my account, but being manager isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over.}}
{{L|King Neptune|Quiet, fool! Mr. Krabs stole my crown, and now it's in Shell City. That's why he must die.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown?}}
{{L|King Neptune|You don't understand. My crown is a symbol of my king-like authority. And between you and me... my hair is thinning a bit.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not that noticeable... ''[King Neptune removes his paper bag covering the top of his head, revealing a huge bald spot that shines]'' Bald! Bald!}}
{{L|All|Bald! Bald! Bald!}}
{{L|Fred|My eyes!}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[places the paper bag back on his head]'' All right, all right.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|King Neptune, sir? Would you spare Mr. Krabs' life if I went to get your crown back?}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[stretches his eyes out]'' You, go to Shell City? ''[laughs while stretching his eyes out again]'' No one who's gone to Shell City has ever returned. What makes you think you could? You're just a kid. ''[throws SpongeBob to the floor]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But I'm not a kid, I can do it.}}
{{L|King Neptune|Run along. I have a crab to cook. ''[lights his trident]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No! ''[SpongeBob gets in the way]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, I won't let you!!}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[Sighs]'' Very well, then. I'll have to fry you both.}}
{{L|Mindy|''[runs to the Krusty Krab]'' Daddy, stop it! Can't you get through one day without executing someone!?}}
{{L|King Neptune|Mindy!? I told you to stay in the carriage!}}
{{L|Mindy|Where's your love and compassion? ''[Holds SpongeBob]'' Look at this little guy. He's willing to risk his life to find your crown and save his boss.}}
{{L|King Neptune|But, daughter, I...}}
{{L|Mindy|Please, Father..at least let him try....What have you got to lose? Might I remind you of your...special problem...?}}
{{L|''[She removes the paper bag, once again revealing the shiny bald spot]''}}
{{L|All|Bald! Bald! Bald!}}
{{L|Fred|My eyes!}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[places the paper bag back on his head]'' All right....Very well, Mindy. I'll give him a chance. But when your little champion fails to return, I get to splatter this crab all over the walls!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Huh?!}}
{{L|King Neptune|And as for you... be back here with my crown in exactly ten days. ''[Patrick pops up]''}}
{{L|Patrick|He can do it in nine!}}
{{L|King Neptune|Eight!}}
{{L|Patrick|Seven!}}
{{L|King Neptune|Six!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs|Patrick! ''[They tackle him]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|Six it is, then.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Being choked by Mr. Krabs]'' Fi--ve.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, shush!}}
{{L|King Neptune|Until then, the crab shall remain frozen where he now stands! ''[He points his trident at Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No, wait... I'm begging you!! ''[King Neptune freezes him]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Who turned on the AC? ''[gasps]'' Mr. Krabs!? Oh, no, this is terrible! Who's gonna sign my paycheck??}}
{{L|King Neptune|Come along, Mindy.}}
{{L|Mindy|Listen, you guys, the road to Shell City is ''really'' dangerous. There's crooks, killers and monsters everywhere! And what's worse, there's a giant Cyclops ''[she imitates the Cyclops stomping]'' who guards the outskirts of the city and preys on innocent sea creatures! Don't let him catch you, because if he does, he'll take you back to his lair, and you'll never be seen again!}}
{{L|''[While Mindy is explaining, SpongeBob is scared but Patrick is infatuated with her]''}}
{{L|Patrick|She's purty, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Mindy|Here, take this.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's in here? ''[Opens bag and few winds blow at his face]''}}
{{L|Mindy|It's a magical bag of winds. I stole them from my father.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[To Mindy]'' You're hot.}}
{{L|Mindy|Once you find the crown, open the bag of winds and you'll be blown back home.}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[from outside]'' Mindy!}}
{{L|Mindy|I'm coming! Good luck, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait! How did you know my name?}}
{{L|Mindy|Oh, I'm gonna be queen of the sea one day. I've learned the names of all the sea creatures.}}
{{L|Patrick|What's my name?}}
{{L|Mindy|That's easy. You're Patrick Star. ''[Patrick's cheeks turn red and he blushes shyly from head to toe]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|Mindy!}}
{{L|Mindy|I gotta go. I believe in you guys.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, Mindy. ''[to Mr. Krabs]'' Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Patrick, Squidward, and I...}}
{{L|Squidward|Pass. ''[He walks out the door, and leaves his hat behind]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick and I... ''[Patrick interrupts]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hi.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Continues]'' ...are gonna get that crown back and save you from Neptune's wrath. You've got nothing to worry about. Your life is in our hands. ''[Mr. Krabs turns his eyes and looks at them. They are drooling, and look very stupid. Mr. Krabs moans out of doubt]'' Patrick, let's go get that crown.}}
{{L|''[They run to the kitchen where they slide down two metallic poles. They enter an elevator where elevator music is playing. The elevator stops at a secret room under the Krusty Krab 2, where the Patty Wagon is kept]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Feast your eyes, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|What is it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The Patty Wagon. Mr. Krabs uses it for promotional reasons. Let me show you some of its features. Sesame-seed finish, steel-belted pickles, grilled-leather interior. And under the hood, a fuel-injected French-fryer with dual overhead grease traps.}}
{{L|Patrick|Wow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah. Wow.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, I thought you didn't have a driver's license.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You don't need a license to drive a sandwich. ''[They start the engine, and crash through the side of the Krusty Krab 2, a word that says "Ker-Patty!" appears]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Shell City, here we come!}}
{{L|''[Later, Plankton enters the Krusty Krab, looking satisfied with himself. Mr. Krabs is still there, frozen]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Ding-a-ling. Hey there, old buddy. ''[Sarcastically]'' Freeze. ''[laughs]'' One secret formula to go, please. No, no, don't trouble yourself. I'll get it. ''[goes into the kitchen and walks out with the bottle with the Formula inside it]'' Well, I'd like to hang around, but I've got Krabby Patties to make... over at the Chum Bucket. Plan Z, I love ya! ''[Mr. Krabs' tears fall to the ground as Plankton leaves, as he realizes that he was set up]''}}
{{L|''[The next scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick riding to a nearby gas station in the Patty Wagon]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|♪Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah. You're a Goofy Goober, yeah. We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah. Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah!♪}}
{{L|''[They stop at a gas station right before the county line. Past the county line, Bikini Bottom's beautiful landscape is replaced by barren locations. SpongeBob is wearing an aviator's outfit at the wheel and honks his horn to wake up the two hick gas station attendants, Floyd and Lloyd.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Fill 'er up, please.}}
{{L|Floyd|What'll it be, fellas? Mustard... er ketchup?! ''[Floyd and Lloyd slap their knees and crack up, rocking in their chairs.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Are they laughing at us?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick. They're laughing next to us.}}
{{L|''[Floyd and Lloyd continue to laugh as they advance towards the Patty Wagon. Then, Lloyd bends down and Floyd uses him for support.]''}}
{{L|Floyd|Where you two dumb kids headed, anyway?}}
{{L|Patrick|Kids?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now, Patrick. For your information, we are not kids. We are men. And we're off to get King Neptune's crown in Shell City.}}
{{L|Floyd and Lloyd|Shell City?}}
{{L|Lloyd|Ain't that the place that's guarded by a killer Cyclops?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's right.}}
{{L|Floyd|Lloyd, take off your hat in respect. Respect for the dead!}}
{{L|''[The two "nyuk" and slap their knees again.]''}}
{{L|Floyd|You two dipsticks ain't gonna last 10 seconds over the county line!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, yeah? We'll see about that. ''[He and Patrick get back into the Patty Wagon and pass the county line. A boat jacker stops them]''}}
{{L|Boat jacker|Out of the car, fellas. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick obey and the boat jacker drives off in the Patty Wagon]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How many seconds was that?}}
{{L|Lloyd|''[checks his watch]'' Twelve.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|In your face!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick slap their knees and laugh like Lloyd and Floyd, who don't seem to care. Patrick makes a loud noise with an airhorn.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's what I'm talking about. Yeah!}}
{{L|Patrick|Who's the kid now?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob runs around Patrick and flaps his arms like chicken wings as Patrick continues to honk the airhorn.]''}}
{{L|Floyd|They're dead.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick continue their laughing as they walk down the road. They give each other a high-five, and Patrick honks his airhorn once more.]''}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to a crowd entering the Chum Bucket back in Bikini Bottom. Perch Perkins is in front, once again reporting on TV]''}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Perch Perkins here with an incredible news flash. Plankton is selling Krabby Patties at the Chum Bucket. How is this possible? Let's find out. ''[He goes inside]''}}
{{L|''[Inside, Plankton is watching his new customers]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Step right up. Plenty for everybody.}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Excuse me, Plankton. Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News. Can I get a minute?}}
{{L|Plankton|Anything for you, Perch.}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|All of Bikini Bottom wants to know, how did you get the Krabby Patty?}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, Perch, before my dear friend Eugene Krabs was frozen by King Neptune.... ''[voice breaking]'' I'm sorry....he confided in me a secret wish...."Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence at the Chum Bucket," he said..."Don't let the flame die out." ''[sobs]'' By the way, act now and you get a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet with every purchase. Here you go, Perch. ''[He plants a bucket helmet on his head]''}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Thanks.}}
{{L|Plankton|Bucket helmets for everyone!}}
{{L|Man|''[happily]'' My helmet!}}
{{L|''[Plankton enters his lab, where Karen is]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Karen, baby, I haven't felt this giddy since the day you agreed to be my wife.}}
{{L|Karen|I never agreed.}}
{{L|Plankton|Evil Plan Z is working perfectly. Nothing can stop me now.}}
{{L|Karen|Nothing except SpongeBob and his pink friend. ''[Displays SpongeBob and Patrick on the road on her computer screen]'' My sensors indicate that they're going after the crown. If they make it back, Neptune might discover some fingerprints. Tiny fingerprints. Stubby, tiny fingerprints. ''[Plankton looks at his hands]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Evil Plan Z is way ahead of you, baby. I've already hired someone to take care of those two. He's a vicious, cold-blooded predator!}}
{{L|''[Miles away, we see a hitman wearing sunglasses traveling on his motorcycle down the road. First, we see the front, then his license plate, which reads "I Kill U", and then his boot, which reads "Your Head Here"]''}}
{{L|Dennis|''[takes off sunglasses in another one]'' Sesame seed....}}
{{L|Floyd|Hey, mister, does that hat take ten gallons?}}
{{L|''[The gas station attendants smack their knees and laugh more. Dennis, very annoyed, stomps up to them and tears their lips off. The hillbillies looks at each other as Dennis drives away.]''}}
{{L|''[Meanwhile, an exhausted SpongeBob and Patrick crawl down the road, sweaty and tired, but still cheering. Patrick's airhorn stops working and he tosses it behind him.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Going on...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah...Moving on...Just keep going...}}
{{L|Patrick|Yup...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gonna get that crown...}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, yeah....All right....}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah....Victory....}}
{{L|Patrick|Are we there yet?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We must be close by now. Patrick, look. ''[He points to a billboard and reads it.]'' We're doing great! Shell City's only five days away! ''[A leaf blocking part of the sign comes off, revealing 2 more words]''}}
{{L|Patrick|By car.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I wish we still had our car.}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, look! Our car!}}
{{L|''[We see the Patty Wagon in front of a beat-up bar. SpongeBob and Patrick are about ready to get in the Patty Wagon, but SpongeBob notices that the key is missing]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The key!}}
{{L|Patrick|Where do you think it is?}}
{{L|''[A fish is kicked through one of the Thug Tug windows and lands next to SpongeBob and Patrick, with many broken bones. His leg twitches. The two look through the broken window, and see thugs fighting, becoming drunk, and playing pool. The inside is a disaster. Everything is cracked or splintered, and the dim lights make everything look red. "R.I.P." is written in spray paint on a wall with a dead or knocked out fish below it. They see the boat jacker playing pool with the key hooked onto his belt.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|There it is, Pat. The key! Now, how are we gonna get it?}}
{{L|Patrick|I know. Walk in and ask him for it.}}
{{L|Thug|''[From inside.]'' What are you looking at!?! ''[SpongeBob hears the punching sounds and pained cries inside]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, that's a terrible idea.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Downcast and realizing SpongeBob's point]'' Sorry.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I know. I'll go in and create a distraction, and you get the key.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Becomes enthusiastic]'' Ooh! Ooh! Wait, I wanna do the distraction!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay... I guess it really doesn't matter who does the distraction.}}
{{L|''[Patrick puffs out his chest as he bursts through the swinging doors, while SpongeBob crawls underneath them. Patrick clears his throat.]''}}
{{L|Thug in background|You see me walkin' back?!}}
{{L|Patrick|Ahem! Can I have everybody's attention? ''[Everyone clusters around Patrick with angry expressions, ready for a fight.]'' I have to use the bathroom.}}
{{L|Boat jacker|''[confusingly]'' It's, uhh...right over there. ''[He points behind him and notices SpongeBob reaching for his key. SpongeBob looks up at him for a second before scuffing around on the ground, searching for something.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Stupid contacts. ''[He holds up an imaginary contact.]'' Oh, there it is. I better go wash it off. ''[Runs away]''}}
{{L|''[Inside the restroom, Patrick is going to the bathroom. He finishes as SpongeBob comes in]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Angry]'' Patrick! You call that a distraction?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Jolts up. He flushes the toilet. Turns to SpongeBob after realizing his error]'' Well, I had to go to the bathroom.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I got my hands dirty for nothing. ''[He pumps the soap dispenser, and the top is pushed off by pressure from bubbles forming inside of it.]'' Patrick, check it out! ''[He pumps more.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Wow!}}
{{L|Both|Hooray! Bubble party! ''[Bubbles float all around the bathroom and ragtime music plays as SpongeBob and Patrick dance with bubbles. Patrick juggles them, as SpongeBob gives him more to juggle. Then, SpongeBob lays on his side and balances one on his foot. Patrick balances one on his head. But one bubble drifts out the door and into the pub. Victor, the bartender, sees it.]''}}
{{L|Victor|Hey! Who blew this bubble?! ''[Victor punches it, and it pops.]'' You all know the rules!}}
{{L|Everybody in the main area of the Thug Tug|''[In unison]'' All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every able-bodied patron in the bar.}}
{{L|One Patron|''[falling behind]'' ...bar.}}
{{L|Victor|That's right! So who blew it?!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick frantically pop all of the bubbles]''}}
{{L|Victor|So... Nobody knows?}}
{{L|Tough Guy #1|Maybe it was...}}
{{L|Victor|Shut up! ''[Throws a chair at him]'' Somebody in here ain't a real man. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick attempt to sneak out, but Victor sees them.]'' You! We're on a baby hunt. And don't think we don't know how to weed 'em out. Now, everybody line up! DJ! Time for the test. ''[The DJ gives a thumbs-up to Victor and plays a CD.]'' No baby can resist singing along to this. ''[The Goofy Goober theme song plays]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Nervously]'' SpongeBob, it's the Goofy Goober theme song.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[In a raspy voice]'' I know! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick try to resist to sing along]''}}
{{L|Goofy Goober|''[On record]'' ♪Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah. You're a Goofy Goober, yeah. We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah. Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah!♪}}
{{L|''[As the song goes on, Victor walks down the line to see the patron's responses to the songs.]''}}
{{L|Tough Guy #2|''[coughs]''}}
{{L|Victor|''[Points at Tough guy angrily]'' It was you! You're the baby!}}
{{L|Tough Guy #2|No, no! I only coughed, I swear! ''[Victor points with two fingers from his eyes to the thug's to show that he's watching him. Then, he walks on. Tough Guy #2 sighs in relief.]''}}
{{L|Victor|DJ! Turn it up louder!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[trying not to sing]'' Don't sing along, Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm trying. Trying so hard. ''[Victor notices his and SpongeBob's struggle and starts singing mockingly]''}}
{{L|Victor|♪I'm a Goofy Goober, YEAH! You're a Goofy Goober, YEAH! We're all Goofy Goobers, YEAH!♪}}
{{L|''[Victor watches as SpongeBob and Patrick can't take it anymore and open their mouths to sing when...]''}}
{{L|Siamese Twins|♪Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah!♪ ''[disc scratch and the song stops]''}}
{{L|Victor|''[laughs.]'' Well, well, well. Which one of you babies was it?!}}
{{L|Siamese Twins|''[Nervously; look at and point at the other]'' It was him! Uh, he did it. I've never even eaten at... ♪Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah!♪ ''[They cover each other's mouths after realizing their words.]''}}
{{L|Victor|Well, looks like we got ourselves a double baby! ''[The thugs surround the twins, crack their knuckles, and lunge at them in unison. SpongeBob and Patrick escape the Thug Tug.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Man, that was a close call.}}
{{L|Patrick|Guess what I got? ''[Pulls out the key]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The key! Shhh...}}
{{L|''[Cut to the Patty Wagon rolling down the street as it becomes night. Back in Bikini Bottom the next morning, Squidward is enjoying the time without SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Too bad SpongeBob's not here to enjoy SpongeBob not being here. ''[He laughs to himself and closes the window. Pan over to the side of his house, which opens like a garage door.

{{L|Nat|Morning. ''[Squidward notices he is wearing a Chum Bucket helmet]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Some people have no taste in headgear. ''[He stops at an intersection, and glances at a husband and wife with their baby in a stroller, showing it to another fish, who shakes a rattle at the giggling baby. All have helmets on.]'' Huh?

{{L|Shubie|''[She looks around confused]'' Who said that?}}
{{L|Squidward|Down here.}}
{{L|Shubie|''[Finds Squidward]'' Oh! Well, I got it at the Chum Bucket. Plankton's giving them away free with every Krabby Patty.}}
{{L|Squidward|Chum Bucket?... Free?... Krabby Patty?... Plankton?... Giving?... With...?!}}
{{L|''[At the Chum Bucket, Plankton is enjoying his day and watching his customers. Squidward bursts in]''}}
{{L|Squidward|So! You're selling Krabby Patties, eh, Plankton?}}
{{L|Plankton|That's right, Squidward. ''[Pulls out a helmet]'' And there's a free bucket helmet with every purchase. Care for one?}}
{{L|Squidward|No! You may have hoodwinked everyone else in this backwater town, but you can't fool me! I listen to public radio.}}
{{L|Plankton|And what's that supposed to mean?}}
{{L|Squidward|It means you set up Mr. Krabs. You stole the crown so Neptune would freeze him and you could finally get your stubby little paws on the Krabby Patty formula. ''[Plankton looks at his hands]'' It was you all along! But you made one fatal mistake. You messed with my paycheck. And I'm gonna report you to the highest authority in the land....King Neptune!}}
{{L|Plankton|We'll see about that, Inspector Looselips! ''[laughs and presses a button on Karen]''}}
{{L|Karen|Now activating helmet brain-control devices.}}
{{L|Squidward|Huh? ''[A satellite goes up on the Chum Bucket. An antenna rises out of each customer's bucket helmet, which covers every customer's head, one by one]'' What!? ''[Soon, they all stand up, as they all speak in a drone.]''}}
{{L|Slaves|All hail Plankton.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Eyes widened]'' What's going on here?}}
{{L|Slaves|All hail Plankton.}}
{{L|Plankton|Seize him, slaves!}}
{{L|Slaves|All hail Plankton.}}
{{L|Squidward|Ah! I'm getting out of here! ''[Runs for the door, but more slaves burst in and corner him]''}}

{{L|Patrick|Okay. ''[Imitates Victor]'' We're on a baby hunt. And don't think we don't know how to ''weed'' 'em out. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|"Weed 'em out."}}
{{L|Patrick|What a jerk. ''[They drive along a pile of skulls]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa! The road's getting kinda bumpy here.}}
{{L|Patrick|You know, SpongeBob, there's a lesson to be learned from all of this.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's that, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|A bubble-blowing double baby doesn't belong out here in man's country.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah. ''[Then realizes something]'' Wait. We blew that bubble. Doesn't that make us a bubble-blowing double baby? ''[Both think about this until Patrick spots a free ice cream stand and sign]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey look! Free ice cream!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whee! Oh, boy! ''[heads the stand, oblivious to the piles of skulls surrounding him]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Talks to a skull]'' How you doing? ''[Patrick looks at his surroundings and looked worried]'' Wait a minute. Wait a minute! SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah?}}
{{L|Patrick|Make mine a chocolate!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Got ya covered. ''[To the old woman]'' Two, please.}}
{{L|Old Woman|Certainly. ''[she takes out a fake ice cream]'' You kids enjoy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Actually, we're men, lady, but thanks. ''[Gets bowl]'' Okay, Patrick, let's... ''[His hand is stuck on the bowl, which the old woman is still holding]'' Uh, you can let go now.

{{L|Dennis|''[He arrives at The Thug Tug, and notices soap on SpongeBob's footprint. He unmasks himself]'' Hmm... ''[He blows the soap, forming a bubble. Images of SpongeBob and Patrick giggling appear in it. Suddenly, all of the thugs appear]''}}

{{L|SpongeBob|''[He and Patrick scream at the cat]'' Jump for it, Patrick! ''[They jump out of the Patty Wagon, which the frog fish eats. It smiles but stops when a tongue grabs it.

{{L|Patrick|Never mind the car, where's the road? ''[echoes]'' Road? Road? Road? ''[the echo turns out to be Patrick repeating in disbelief]'' Road, road, road, road, ''[SpongeBob stares at him]'' r... sorry.}}

{{L|SpongeBob|I'm going home, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|But what about Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What about us? We'll never survive in that trench! You said it yourself, this is man's country. And let's face it, Pat. We're just...kids.}}
{{L|Patrick|We're not kids!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Open your eyes, Patrick! We blow bubbles, we eat ice cream. We worship a dancing peanut, for corn's sake! We don't belong out here!}}
{{L|Patrick|We do not worship him!?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Pulls down his shorts]'' Patrick. You've been wearing the same Goofy Goober Peanut Party underpants for three years straight! ''[We see Patrick's underwear with the Goofy Goober pictures on it]'' What do you call that!?}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Pull your pants up, Patrick. We're going home.}}

{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick see Mindy riding a coach driven by seahorses]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mindy!}}
{{L|Patrick|Mindy?! ''[Struggles to pull his shorts up]'' Huh...?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How much did you hear?}}
{{L|Mindy|I heard enough.}}
{{L|Patrick|Did you see my underwear?}}
{{L|Mindy|No, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[About to pull down his shorts]'' Did you want to?}}
{{L|Mindy|Look, guys, you may be kids, but you're the only ones left who can get that crown.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What do you mean, the only ones left?}}
{{L|Mindy|Things have gotten a lot worse since you left Bikini Bottom. ''[Pulls out a magical clam, which opens up revealing Bikini Bottom now]'' Or should I say, Planktopolis?}}
{{L|Slaves|All hail Plankton.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Holding a whip]'' No resting! This monument celebrating my glory isn't gonna build itself! Move faster!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, my gosh! Patrick, look! Plankton's turned everyone we know into slaves.

{{L|Gary|Meow Plankton.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Can't your father do something?}}
{{L|Mindy|My father's too distracted by his bald spot to do anything. ''[The magical clam shows Neptune's bald spot about to be sprayed by the Squire with hair growth spray]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|Squire, will you hurry? ''[The Squire is nervous. He closes his eyes and accidentally sprays Neptune's eyes, which grow hair. Neptune screams in pain]''}}
{{L|Mindy|''[She closes the clam]'' So you see, you can't quit. The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But... But we're just...}}
{{L|Mindy|Hey. It doesn't matter if you're kids. What's so wrong with being a kid, anyway? Kids rule! You don't need to be a man to do this. You just gotta believe in yourself. You just gotta believe! ''[Swims up into the sky, then comes back down]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I believe.}}
{{L|Mindy|That's the spirit!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I believe that...everybody I know is a goner! ''[He and Patrick begin sobbing]''}}
{{L|Mindy|Come on, guys. ''[They don't stop]'' Guys... ''[They still don't stop]'' Guys? ''[they both spray tears to each other's mouths]'' Ew!}}

''[SpongeBob and Patrick look at Mindy]'' A couple of kids could never survive this journey. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick look at each other and they cry again]'' That's why I guess I'll just have to turn you into men. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick stop crying]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You can do that? How?}}
{{L|Mindy|With my ''mermaid magic.''}}
{{L|Horses|''[neighing, subtitles read: "Mermaid Magic?" Mindy shushes]''}}

{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Hooray! ''[Singing]'' We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men!}}
{{L|Mindy|Good. Now, let's get started. Close your eyes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[He and Patrick close their eyes]'' Are we men yet?}}
{{L|Mindy|Not yet. Uh... spin around three times.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[He and Patrick spin like doing ballet]'' I think it's working.}}
{{L|Mindy|Good. Now, keep your eyes shut. ''[Grabs two blades of seaweed]'' With my mermaid magic and my one tailfin ''[Patrick giggles. Mindy puts the seaweeds onto SpongeBob and Patrick]'', I command the two of you to turn into men! Open your eyes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[He and Patrick open their eyes]'' I don't feel any... ''[Notices that Patrick has a "mustache"]'' Oh, my gosh, Patrick, you have a mustache!}}
{{L|Patrick|So do you!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow... ''[He and Patrick play with each other's "mustaches"]''}}
{{L|Mindy|So now that you're men, can you make it to Shell City? ''[SpongeBob and Patrick still adore their "mustaches"]'' Guys!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Yeah?}}
{{L|Mindy|I said, now that you're men, can you make it to Shell City?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Heck, yeah!}}
{{L|Mindy|Are men afraid of anything?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Heck, no!}}
{{L|Mindy|And why?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Because we're invincible! ''[they jump off the trench]'' Yeah! Woo-hoo!}}
{{L|Mindy|''[yelling down to them]'' I never said that!}}

{{L|Patrick|Right! ''[He and SpongeBob rush over to the crown and get ready to pick it up]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|On three, Patrick. Ready? One, two, three. ''[The scuba diver picks up the crown]'' Hey, it's lighter than I thought. Whoa! ''[The camera pulls up to reveal that the Cyclops is the one that picked it up.]''}}

{{L|Patrick|I sure do! ''[Patrick shows a lump on his butt. He and SpongeBob laugh]'' Here you go. ''[Pulls out the bag. SpongeBob stares at the lump, wide-eyed]'' What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nothing, nothing... Okay, let's go over the instructions. ''[Reads the paper with the instructions on it]'' Let's see, it says here, "Step one: Point bag away from home."}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay. ''[Points bag at Shell City]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|"Step two: Plant feet firmly on ground."}}
{{L|Patrick|Right! ''[Plants his feet in the sand]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|"Step three: Remove string from bag releasing the winds."}}
{{L|Patrick|Check. ''[Pulls the string tied around the bag, and the bag flies out of his arm. He looks around]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, that seems simple enough. "Point bag away from home, feet firmly on ground, pull string, releasing the winds." All right, let's do it for real.}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh, SpongeBob? ''[points to the bag flying away like a deflating balloon]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, no, stop! ''[He chases after the bag]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I was bad, I'm sorry! Please, bag. I'm sorry, I just thought... It was a mistake! ''[the bag falls into the water]''}}

{{L|David Hasselhoff|All hands on deck. ''[Places them on his pecs and prepares for liftoff]''}}
{{L|Houston Voice|Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight...}}
{{L|King Neptune|Eugene Krabs, the time has come... ''[Lights his trident]''}}
{{L|Mindy|''[Outside]'' No!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Jumps off his chair]'' Yes!}}
{{L|Houston Voice|...six, five...}}
{{L|King Neptune|... for you...}}
{{L|Mindy|''[Outside]'' No!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Pulls Antennae]'' Yes!}}
{{L|Houston Voice|...three, two...}}
{{L|King Neptune|...to fry.}}
{{L|Mindy|''[Outside]'' No-o-oo!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Wide-eyed]'' Yes!}}
{{L|Houston Voice|... one. ''[SpongeBob, Patrick, and the crown are launched back down to Bikini Bottom]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[Scream]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Closes his eyes]'' No! ''[Just then, SpongeBob and Patrick fall through the roof. Krabs is about to be fried, but the crown blocks the ray, and it is blasted up to the surface, where Hasselhoff is floating on his back]''}}
{{L|David Hasselhoff|You done good, Hasselhoff. You done... ''[He is blasted with Neptune's ray but survives]'' Ow. ''[Back at the sea. Mr. Krabs opens his eyes, seeing SpongeBob and Patrick dancing with delight and King Neptune looking at his crown.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hooray! We made it!}}
{{L|Patrick|We made it! ''[Mr. Krabs happily dances with them.]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|My crown! My beautiful crown! ''[Kisses it]''}}
{{L|Mindy|''[Comes inside]'' SpongeBob? Patrick? I knew you could do it! ''[Hugs them. Plankton then starts clapping slowly]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Sarcastically]'' Oh, yes. Well done, SpongeBoob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Sarcastically]'' Sorry to rain on your parade, Plankton.}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, don't worry about me. My parade shall be quite dry under my.....umbrella! ''[pulls a cord that is hanging above him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Mindy, and Patrick|Umbrella? ''[Turn to Neptune, who is still kissing his crown. The door on the ceiling that says, King Size, opens up and a helmet falls out. It lands on Neptune's head. He struggles to get it off]''}}
{{L|Mindy|Daddy, no!}}
{{L|Plankton|Daddy, yes! ''[Pulls out a remote control with only a big, red button on it. He presses the button]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[We see Neptune still struggling. An antenna emerges from the top of the helmet, turning him to a slave. He stops and says only 3 words]'' All hail Plankton. ''[Mindy, SpongeBob, and Patrick scream. Plankton's slaves burst in through the windows]''}}
{{L|People|All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. ''[Patrick, Mindy, and SpongeBob back up against the wall. Neptune lights his trident]''}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, what happened?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Plankton cheated.}}
{{L|Plankton|Cheated!? ''[To Neptune]'' Hold on there, baldy! ''[Neptune turns off the light in his trident. To SpongeBob]'' Oh, grow up. What, you think this is a game of kickball on the playground? You never had a chance to defeat me, fool! And you know why?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Because you cheated?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Dumbfounded for a second]'' No, not because I cheated. Because I'm an evil genius! And you're just a kid. A stupid kid! ''[He and his slaves laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I guess you're right, Plankton. I am just a kid.}}
{{L|Plankton|Of course I'm right. Okay, Neptune, time to kill.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And you know, I've been through a lot in the past six days, five minutes, twenty-seven-and-a-half seconds. And if I've learned anything during that time, It's that you are who you are.}}
{{L|Plankton|That's right. Okay, Neptune...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And no amount of mermaid magic... ''[Turns to Mindy, who looks down sadly]'' ...or managerial promotion... ''[Turns to the frozen Mr. Krabs]'' ...or some other third thing... can make me anything more than what I really am inside: A kid.}}
{{L|Plankton|That's great. Now, get back against the wall.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[over microphone]'' But that's okay!}}
{{L|Plankton|What? What's going on?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Because I did what everyone said a kid couldn't do! I made it to Shell City, and I beat the Cyclops, and I rode the Hasselhoff, and I brought the crown back!}}
{{L|Plankton|All right, we get the point....}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So, yeah, I'm a kid. ''[Dry ice smoke surrounds Plankton, and a spotlight falls on SpongeBob]'' And I'm also a goofball. And a wing nut. And a Knucklehead McSpazatron!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[coughs from the smoke]'' What's going on here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But most of all, I'm...... ''[he swipes his arm]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Okay, settle down. Take it easy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm.....I'm......}}
{{L|Plankton|What the scallop?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Bursts into song]'' ♪I'm a Goofy Goober! Rock!♪ ''[Plankton goes flying into the wall and leaves a gaping hole in it]'' ''[Points at the crowd of bucketheads]'' ♪You're a Goofy Goober! Rock! ''[The camera zooms out of the Krusty Krab 2 and Bikini Bottom and into space, showing the Earth made of clay. SpongeBob jumps on top of the clay Earth]'' We're all Goofy Goobers! ''[A UFO with an alien in it floats by. It briefly stops and SpongeBob jumps into it, then it flies off-screen]'' Rock! ''[The Earth turns over to reveal SpongeBob's face on the other side]'' Goofy, goofy, goober, goober! Rock!! ''[The camera zooms into SpongeBob's mouth and transitions to a scene with a brick wall with a large vent on it. A spotlight moves around before it focuses on SpongeBob, who is sneaking forward and wearing a green toque. SpongeBob stops at a part of the brick wall with a sign labeled "JAIL" and a TNT plunger near it]'' Put your toys away, well, all I gotta say when you tell me not to play, I say no way! ''[Pushes the TNT plunger, causing an explosion to destroy the wall. Several toys come running out]'' No way! No, no freaking way! ''[Transition to a scene with SpongeBob wearing a black fedora and standing under something.]'' I'm a kid, you say, ''[The camera zooms out to reveal Patrick, who has grown to a huge size and is wearing fishnet socks and black boots with heels]'' when you say I'm a kid I say, say it again and then I say thanks! ''[Patrick kicks up his right leg]'' Thanks! ''[Patrick spins around, claps and does a split]'' Thank you very much! ''[SpongeBob pulls down his shades and shows a surprised expression. The scene is duplicated twice. Transition to a background of ice cream. SpongeBob moves backward in a forward slithering motion]'' So if you're thinking that you'd like to be like me, go ahead and try, the kid inside ''[SpongeBob opens his mouth and stretches out his tongue. A smaller SpongeBob slides across SpongeBob's tongue]'' will set! You! Free! ''[The tiny SpongeBob dons a top hat, dress outfit, bowtie, star-shaped sunglasses and cane (all colored white) and dances while moving the cane back and forth]'' ''Humala bebuhla zeebuhla boobuhla humala bebuhla zeebuhla bop!'' ''[The scene shatters to transition back to the Krusty Krab 2. SpongeBob held the same pose as when he stopped dancing]'' I'm a Goofy Goober! ''[The word "ROCK!" written in pink is shown on a background of a grassy field with a large stone in it]'' Rock!♪}}
{{L|Plankton|''[He is recovering from being flung into the wall]'' What's happening? ''[Sees SpongeBob dancing]'' His dance moves are impressive, ''[Puts on headphones and a microphone]'' but I'm in control. ''[To slaves]'' Seize him!}}
{{L|People|All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. ''[Crowd in around SpongeBob. A few seconds later, SpongeBob bursts out in a wizard outfit (with a purple hat and robe both covered in peanuts, and tall, white shoes), playing an electric guitar (with the letters "GG" on its head, obviously standing for "Goofy Goober"). He slowly goes up while Plankton and Mr. Krabs look at him ascend]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Whoo!}}
{{L|''[As SpongeBob plays the electric guitar, its head stock lights up and a laser beam blasts out and destroys a slave's helmet]''}}
{{L|Fish|''[After SpongeBob zaps his helmet, and it comes off]'' I'm free. I've been freed!}}
{{L|Plankton|What...? ''[SpongeBob zaps more helmets off]'' ''[Plankton screams]'' No! ''[SpongeBob twirls into action, zapping even more helmets off]'' My precious helmets!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[SpongeBob zaps his helmet]'' Ha!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[SpongeBob zaps her helmet]'' Oh!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[SpongeBob zaps her helmet]'' Yee-haw!}}
{{L|Gary|''[SpongeBob zaps his helmet]'' Meow. ''[SpongeBob blasts the Krusty Krab 2's antenna, breaking the helmets on all slaves outside.]''}}
{{L|All|''[in their slave voices as earlier]'' Yay.}}
{{L|Plankton|His chops are too righteous! The helmets can't handle this level of rock 'n' roll! Karen, do something! Karen? ''[Looks for her. She is surfing through the crowd]'' All right, that's the last straw! Neptune, I command you to-- ''[SpongeBob zaps Neptune's helmet. Mindy hands him his crown]''}}
{{L|Mindy|Here you go, Daddy.}}
{{L|Plankton|I... better get outta here. ''[Runs for the door, but a crowd of freed fish burst in]''}}
{{L|Sandals|Look, it's the wizard who saved us.}}
{{L|Plankton|Out of my way, fools. ''[The freed fish ignore him and rush to see SpongeBob, stomping over Plankton in the process]'' Ow! Ow! Ow! ''[yelping]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[He is now squished into the texture of cookie dough, covered with shoe-prints. The policemen pick him up and put him in a cage]'' Come on, I was just kidding. Come on, you guys knew that, didn't you? With the helmets and the big monuments...hehehe....wasn't that hilarious, everybody? ''[His cage is put in a police car, which drives away]'' Th...I will destroy all of you...!! ''[Everyone watches the scene unfold and they return to the Krusty Krab 2]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|Well, Mindy, I have to admit, you were right. Your compassion for these sea creatures proved a most admirable trait. Without it, I would have never again seen my beloved crown. I think you're going to make a fine ruler of the sea one day. Now, let's go home. ''[Turns to leave, but is stopped by Mindy]''}}
{{L|Mindy|Daddy, haven't you forgotten something?}}
{{L|King Neptune|What? Oh, yeah. Eugene Krabs, I forgot to unfreeze you. ''[He does so, but Mr. Krabs is now a human instead of a crab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What the?...}}
{{L|King Neptune|Whoops! I guess I had it set to "real boy" ending. ''[Sets the trident's ending settings from "real boy" to "unfrozen" and then turns Krabs back from a human into a crab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yippee!}}
{{L|King Neptune|Oh, I'm sorry for falsely freezing you, Krabs. And may I say, sir, you are a very lucky fellow to have in your employment such a brave, faithful, and heroic young lad. Where is he, anyway?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm up here. ''[We see him hanging from ropes]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm on it. ''[Gets SpongeBob down]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|Go to him now, Krabs. Embrace him. ''[Krabs walks over to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, me boy, I'm sorry I ever doubted ye. That's a mistake I won't make again.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Mr. Krabs, you old soft-serve. ''[They hug]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And now, SpongeBob, I'm gonna do something that I should've done six days ago. Mr. Squidward! Front and center, please. ''[Squidward comes]'' I think we all know who rightfully deserves to wear that manager pin. ''[Looks at SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I couldn't agree more, sir.}}
{{L|Harold|Hooray for SpongeBob!}}
{{L|''[Everyone cheers]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait a second, everybody. There's something I need to say first. I just don't know how to put it.}}
{{L|Squidward|I think I know what it is. After going on your life-changing journey, you now realize you don't want what you thought you wanted. What you really wanted was inside you all along.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you crazy?! ''[Grabs manager pin]'' I was just gonna say that your fly is down! ''[Squidward's eyes widen]'' Manager!? This is the greatest day of my life! ''[jumps in the air in excitement and a freeze frame occurs and fades to the credits]''}}
{{L|''[The credits begin rolling as ''[[Ocean Man]]," ''[[SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy]]," ''[[Just a Kid]]," and ''[[Best Day Ever]]'' play]''}}

{{L|Usher|Excuse me, sir. You folks have to leave. ''[All the pirates growl]''}}
{{L|Captain|What? ''[Points his sword at her]'' Say that again, if you dare.}}
{{L|Usher|You folks have to leave.}}
{{L|Captain|''[Sadly]'' Okay.}}
