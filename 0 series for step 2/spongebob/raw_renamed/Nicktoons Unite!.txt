This article is the transcript for cutscenes of the [[List of games#Crossovers|crossover game]], ''[[Nicktoons Unite!]]'', which was released on {{Time|October 26}}, {{Time|2005}}.

==Intro cutscene==
{{L|''[The scene begins showing Conch Street behind some coral.]''}}
{{L|French narrator|''[As the coral separates, making Conch Street more visible. There is a wall next to SpongeBob's house.]'' Ah. Bikini Bottom. A paradise on the ocean floor. Home to many undersea creatures living their lives in peace and tranquility.}}
{{L|''[The scene cuts to another shot of Conch Street. SpongeBob is shown skipping towards Gary, who is outside the pineapple.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good morning, Gary. What are we gonna to do today? ''[Gary meows.]'' Great idea! Let's visit, Patrick.}}
{{L|''[A PA system starts up and SpongeBob turns to the direction of the noise. At the PA System, which is on a wall near Conch Street, there are fish looking up at the PA system.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Through the PA System]'' Citizens of Bikini Bottom, may I have your attention please.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I wonder what's going on?}}
{{L|''[Gary meows.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|From now on, I, Plankton, and the Syndicate ''[Jellyfish Harvesters drive into the scene.]'' will rule Bikini Bottom! ''[Plankton laughs]'' But, I'm fair. I listen to the little people. Those of you who don't want me to rule, raise your hand. ''[Several fish raise their fin.]'' Get them!}}
{{L|''[The Jellyfish Harvesters suck the fish up. SpongeBob and Gary hide on the side of their house.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Plankton can't do that to people. ''[SpongeBob gasps]'' Oh, no. If Plankton's in charge, he'll steal the Krabby Patty formula and shut down the Krusty Krab.}}
{{L|''[A portal opens and Goddard flies out. SpongeBob screams and jumps up in terror.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't eat me!}}
{{L|''[Goddard lands on the ground and opens the flap for his TV screen. Jimmy Neutron appears in his lab.]''}}
{{L|Jimmy|Hello, SpongeBob. We haven't met, but believe me, I'm your friend. Plankton has joined forces with villains from other worlds and with their help, he's taking over Bikini Bottom.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on, SpongeBob, wake up. Oh, I must have had too much ice cream last night.}}
{{L|Jimmy|''[Off-screen]'' I've been gathering information about your world and I know you've dealt with him before. Please SpongeBob, ''[The scene cuts to the PA system.]'' we need your help.}}
{{L|Plankton|Anyone else care to defy me?}}
{{L|''[The scene cuts back to SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, I'll do what I can to help.}}
{{L|Jimmy|''[On-Screen]'' Follow my dog and he will lead you to me. I'll be able to tell you more when you get to my lab.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gary, stand guard and don't let them in. I'll be back soon.}}
{{L|''[Gary meows. Off-screen, SpongeBob enters the portal and it closes.]''}}

==SpongeBob Meets the Team==
{{L|''[In Retroville, SpongeBob lands face first into the floor of Jimmy's lab. He is next to Goddard.]''}}
{{L|Jimmy|''[Off-Screen]'' I'm Jimmy Neutron. Welcome to my lab.}}
{{L|Timmy Turner|''[Off-Screen; as Jimmy is walking towards SpongeBob]'' This is amazing. ''[Jimmy stops walking.]'' He's a giant block of cheese.}}
{{L|''[Danny Phantom walks towards SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|Jimmy|Timmy, SpongeBob is a sponge from a place called, "Bikini Bottom". Oh, that reminds me. ''[Jimmy takes out a spray can and starts spraying SpongeBob]'' My Neutronic Moisture Sealer will keep you moist outside of water.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This is the strangest morning I had since, well, last Tuesday.}}
{{L|Danny|Wow. He can talk?}}
{{L|Jimmy|Of course he can, Danny. Where SpongeBob comes from, all sea creatures can talk. ''[SpongeBob, Danny, Jimmy, and Timmy walk to Jimmy's computer.]'' SpongeBob, we need to bring you up to speed on what's happening. This all started with my latest invention, the Universe Portal Machine. It's a device that let's us travel to other worlds. ''[The computer screen shows a 2D images of Professor Calamitous.]'' Professor Calamitous has somehow gained access ''[The blueprints for the Universe Portal Machine appear on the screen.]'' to my project plans and created a copy of my machine. I've been tracking Calamitous' portals ''[The image of Calamitous appears.]'' and he's been visiting your worlds. ''[The image of Calamitous shrinks and is moved to the left. An image of Vlad Plasmius joins the image of Calamitous.]'' He's found ''[The image of Vlad shrinks and is moved other right.]'' an ally in ''[An image of Mr. Crocker appears.]'' each world ''[The image of Mr. Crocker shrinks and is moved next to the image of Calamitous.]'' and they've teamed up ''[An image of Plankton appears.]'' to form ''[The image of Plankton shrinks and is moved next to the image of Vlad.]'' a Syndicate. ''[Lines connecting each member of the Evil Syndicate appear. The images are also highlighted.]'' He must have some sort of master plan that they can all benefit from. They've ''[The image of the Evil Syndicate is replace by an image of a robotic syndicate troop.]'' combined their powers to create an army of Syndicate Troops and their ''[The image of the robotic syndicate troop is moved to the upper right corner.]'' stealing ''[An image of Vlad stealing energy from his ghost portal appear.]'' energy from each of your worlds. We ''[The image of Vlad is moved below the image of the syndicate troop.]'' don't know ''[An image of the Rainbow Bridging leading into Crocker's Fortress appears.]'' why their stealing this energy, but whatever ''[The image is moved below the image of Vlad. An image of Jellyfish in the Jellyfish Factory appears.]'' it's for, it won't be good.}}
{{L|Timmy|Don't be such a ''[He rolls his eyes.]'' science nerd. If you think about it, this is actually pretty cool. It's just like one of my games.}}
{{L|''[Cosmo and Wanda "Poof!" in.]''}}
{{L|Wanda|Now Timmy, this is a lot more serious than one of your video games. We've lost our powers because of this Syndicate and we won't be able to do anything until their stopped.}}
{{L|Cosmo|Yeah, Timmy, right now, this wand is just a glorified backscratcher.}}
{{L|Jimmy|Your holograms are right, Timmy. We must work together to stop the Syndicate. I know that you've each defeated these guys individually. That's why I brought you all here. If we combine our knowledge, we can beat them.}}
{{L|Timmy|All I'm saying is that it's exciting to work as a team and save the day.}}
{{L|Danny|Well, now that the entire team is assembled, I think it's time we get started.}}
{{L|Jimmy|Okay. Since we don't know where Calamitous' secret laboratory is, our only leads lie in each of your worlds. To begin with, let's stop them from draining the energy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Where should we start?}}
{{L|Danny|How about Amity Park?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[While he and the other heroes are running towards the portal]'' Let's go!}}

==The Heroes Enter Amity Park==
===Introduction===
After entering the portal, they travel to Amity Park. Here, the heroes find themselves inside Vlad's Castle.

===Transcript===
{{L|Jimmy|Huh? Where are we? I set the machine to send us to Danny's school. I must have made a miscalculation.}}
{{L|Vlad|''[As the Heroes are turning around.]'' Oh, you've made no mistake. ''[He start to float towards them.]'' I've taken up residence ''[He stops moving]'' at Casper High or at least where Casper High once stood. I'm glad you could finally make it. I've been waiting for you all to arrive.}}
{{L|Danny|Sorry, we were late, but now, let's get the party started.}}
{{L|''[Vlad laughs.]''}}
{{L|Vlad|Oh, it's not that simple, Danny. I ''[The scene pans to show Jack and Maddie Fenton]'' have the upper-hand. All you need to do is join me and I will let them go.}}
{{L|Danny|I told you before, I use my powers for good.}}
{{L|Vlad|You cannot resist, Danny. The Syndicate ''[The scene cuts to show panning through the heroes.]'' ''[Off-screen]'' cannot be defeated. With every passing moment, this ghost portal provides us with power for the Syndicate's ultimate plan and provides me with unlimited ghost energy.}}
{{L|Danny|I will never join you!}}
{{L|''[Vlad sighs.]''}}
{{L|Vlad|You will have plenty of time to reconsider my offer further as you rot for eternity ''[He shoots a blast out of his hand.]'' in the Ghost Zone ''[The blast hits the kids and they scream. They are knocked out]'' Prison!}}

==Ghost Zone Prison==
===Introduction===
After escaping their cell in the Ghost Zone Prison, the heroes travel through the facility fighting guards and syndicate troops. They find an ability pod for Danny, which gives him his overshadowing ability. Eventually, they reach the boss battle, Walker, the warden of the Ghost Zone Prison. The cutscene begins once the player(s) defeat(s) Walker. It begins with walker falling to the ground.

===Transcript===
{{L|Timmy|So, how are we going to get out of this Ghost Zone?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait a minute. If this is a Ghost Zone, then those things before...they m-must have been...Ghosts!}}
{{L|Danny|Ya know, Vlad's not the only one with a ghost portal.}}
{{L|Jimmy|You have access to another ghost portal?}}
{{L|Danny|It's nearby. Follow me.}}
{{L|''[The heroes then run away.]''}}

==Fenton Works==
===Introduction===
After escaping the Ghost Zone Prison and the heroes enter a ghost portal and end up in the basement of Fenton Works.

===Transcript===
{{L|''[The scene pans through the lab.]''}}
{{L|Jimmy|Fascinating! This looks like ghost hunting technology. Did you make these devices yourself?}}
{{L|Danny|Uh...No. Uh. The Fenton Family are the ghost technology wizards, ''[chuckles]'' not me.}}
{{L|Timmy|The Fentons? Are they the freaky couple Vlad had trapped in his throne room? If they are ghost experts, we should try to rescue them!}}
{{L|Danny|We can't! Vlad's too powerful with his ghost portal open. We need to find some way to shut it down.}}
{{L|Jimmy|If I spend some time studying these devices, perhaps we can build a gadget to close the portal.}}
{{L|''[The scene stops panning when it shows Timmy and his fairies.]''}}
{{L|Cosmo|This is no time to be studying!}}
{{L|''[The scene switches to a shot with all the heroes, in it.]''}}
{{L|Timmy|Yeah! We're heroes! Heroes don't just sit around and study!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're right! Heroes go out and save the world!}}
{{L|Danny|All right! Let's get going! We'll figure out a plan once we get to Vlad's castle.}}

==Outside Vlad's Castle==
===Introduction===
After Jimmy enters an ability pod and gains his Shrink Ray, the heroes leave the basement and find themselves outside, where Sam Manson and Tucker Foley tell them that ghosts have overshadowed people and that the heroes need to stop them. Once they do (and Timmy gains the Freeze Glove ability from an ability pod), they find themselves at the Amity Park Cemetery, where they meet back up with Sam and Tucker. They tell the heroes that they can get to Vlad's castle through the Cemetery. The heroes fight through the cemetery until they reach the castle.

===Transcript===
{{L|SpongeBob|Hooray! Amity Park is a ghost-free zone!}}
{{L|Jimmy|Not quite. There's still one big ''ghost'' we need to take care of.}}
{{L|Danny|''[As the heroes are running towards the castle]'' Let's close his portal for good!}}

==Inside Vlad's Castle==
===Introduction===
The heroes enter Vlad's castle.

===Transcript===
{{L|''[The scene pans through the opening room.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This place isn't so creepy... ''[short laugh]'' right, guys?... ''[scared]'' right?}}
{{L|Timmy|This place is awesome! It's just like something out of a scary movie.}}
{{L|Danny|We need a way to shut down that ghost portal. We can't beat Vlad ''[The scene stops panning.]'' while that thing is open.}}
{{L|''[The scene fades to black.]''}}
{{L|Jimmy|Vlad would need a lot of energy to keep that portal open. He must have ''[The scene fades to show a generator.]'' generators in this castle.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's why ''[The generator scene fades to black.]'' you're the Boy Genius!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob laughs. The scene fades to show the heroes at the front gate.]''}}
{{L|Danny|Let's find those generators and shut 'em down.}}

==Outside the Throne Room==
===Introduction===
The heroes battle their way through the castle. SpongeBob gains the Water Soak ability and Danny gains the Phase Shift ability via an ability pod. At the end of their journey, they find themselves at outside the throne room, which is where they landed when they arrived in Amity Park.

===Transcript===
{{L|Danny|Okay, that should do it! Now that the ghost portal is out of the picture, ''[As the heroes are running towards the throne room]'' let's go find Vlad!}}

==Inside the Throne Room==
{{L|''[The heroes run towards Vlad, but stop when they get close to him.]''}}
{{L|Vlad|So, Danny, you've escaped from the Ghost Zone and shut down my portal.}}
{{L|Danny|Give it up, Vlad! You've lost your power and Amity Park has been saved! It's all over, just give up.}}
{{L|Vlad|You underestimate me, Danny. With the help of the Syndicate, I'll soon have it up and running again. And, we've already harnessed enough ghost energy for our device.}}
{{L|Danny|"Our device"? The syndicate is building something?}}
{{L|Vlad|Yes, and very soon you will all bow down to the might of the Syndicate.}}
{{L|Danny|It doesn't matter what you're planning, we're going to stop you!}}
{{L|Vlad|Oh, but what of Jack and Maddie Fenton? Surely you wouldn't risk their innocent lives, would you?}}
{{L|Danny|I'm not going to stand here and let you treat them like puppets! Get ready to pay for this!}}

==Vlad Defeated==
===Introduction===
After overshadowing Jack Fenton, Danny uses Jack, who is wearing his Fenton Ghost Gloves, to defeat Vlad.

===Transcript===
{{L|Vlad|I don't believe it.}}
{{L|''[Danny laughs.]''}}
{{L|Danny|You better believe it, Vlad. You've lost.}}
{{L|Vlad|For now, maybe, but soon you will regret standing up to the Syndicate. ''[A portal opens]'' This is far from over. Far, far from over.}}
{{L|''[Vlad enters the portal and it closes.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That mean, old Vlad escaped!}}
{{L|Timmy|At least, the Fentons are safe.}}
{{L|Danny|Well, that's a relief. Okay, let's get outta here before they notice us.}}
{{L|Jimmy|But, I was hoping to learn more about their ghost-hunting technology!}}
{{L|Danny|Trust me, ghost hunters and ghost boys don't mix. Besides, Amity Park is back to normal and we've got other worlds to save.}}
{{L|''[A portal opens.]''}}
{{L|Jimmy|You're right. Here we go!}}

==The Heroes Enter Bikini Bottom==
===Introduction===
After going through the portal in Amity Park, the heroes find themselves back at Jimmy's lab. The heroes then go through the portal again and find themselves in Bikini Bottom, more specifically, outside the pineapple.

===Transcript===
{{L|Timmy|Wow. This is Bikini Bottom? I can't believe we're under the sea.}}
{{L|Jimmy|Everyone, keep chewing your Neutronic Air Gum. It will let you breathe in this environment.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't wait to introduce you to all my friends. There's Patrick and Squidward and Mr.--}}
{{L|Danny|Uh, SpongeBob, where is everybody?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now that you mention it, it is a bit quiet. Too quiet.}}
{{L|Jimmy|If everyone is missing, the Syndicate may be responsible.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Jimmy, I think it's something much more devious than that. I think that someone has prepared...a surprise birthday party for me! ''[The scene cuts to the roof of Squidward's house. SpongeBob jumps onto the roof.]'' Surprise! Huh, not here. ''[The scene cuts to a house nearby. SpongeBob jumps out from behind the house.]'' Surprise! Nope, not here, either. ''[The scene cuts to a bamboo fence nearby. SpongeBob jumps out from behind it.]'' Surprise! ''[While scratching his head.]'' Wow. They're hiding so well, it's gonna take me forever to find everyone.}} 
{{L|''[SpongeBob walks back to the others.]''}}
{{L|Jimmy|I don't think that's it, SpongeBob. I think that--}}
{{L|''[The scene pans out two show six robotic syndicate troops.]''}}
{{L|Robotic Syndicate Troops|Surprise!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Is it a costume party?}}
{{L|Danny|I don't think they're costumes.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[As she comes out from behind one of the Robotic Syndicate Troops and karate chops it]'' Hy-yah! ''[The robot's head turns around.]'' ''[Off-screen]'' Come on, SpongeBob, ''[As the robot troops falls]'' let's skidaddle.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sandy! I knew you wouldn't miss my surprise party.}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob, ''[On-screen]'' your birthday's not for another month. Now, you and ''[As Sandy and the heroes run away]'' your friends, follow me.}}

==[[Krusty Krab]]==
===Introduction===
After following Sandy for a while, the heroes get separated from her. Eventually, they meet back up with her. They follow her again until they end up getting separated from her again. Eventually, they meet her at The Krusty Krab. She tells them that they need to rescue five fish. On their way, SpongeBob enters an ability pod and gains the DoodleBob Lure ability. After they are done rescuing the fish, they head back to The Krusty Krab, where Sandy tells the heroes the situation.

===Transcript===
{{L|Sandy|Okay, guys, here's the situation. Plankton has taken control of Bikini Bottom. He's locked up anyone who's resisted and one of the first to get captured was Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, no!}}
{{L|Sandy|Now, he's catching the jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields and transporting them back to his Fortress Factory, where he's extracting power from their sting.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Those poor Jellyfish!}}
{{L|Sandy|I have a plan to save the Jellyfish and overthrow Plankton and we need your help.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We'd be happy to help, Sandy!}}
{{L|Sandy|First, we go to Jellyfish Fields and destroy his Jellyfish Harvesting Machines. That should disrupt Plankton's plans...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And save those wild Jellyfish!}}
{{L|Sandy|Next, we will sneak into Plankton's fortress and shut down his machines...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And save the captured Jellyfish!}}
{{L|Sandy|In all that Chaos, we should be able to sneak into Plankton's control center to stop his operation completely.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And save Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Timmy|Ooh, this is like a spy movie! Do we have any secret agents?}}
{{L|Sandy|You're smart, kid. We've already got an agent in Jellyfish Fields. Your mission is to make contact with our agent.}}
{{L|Jimmy|And how will we know this agent?}}
{{L|Sandy|Don't worry, he one of our best men. His codename is "Agent Star."}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow. A secret agent, I wonder who it could be.}}
