{{L|''[Submarine sinks underwater and starts to fly through Bikini Bottom]''}}

{{L|Patrick|Got it! ''[Throws net on jellyfish causing it to buzz and knock Patrick over harder]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Careful Patrick! We wouldn't want to hurt the little jelly!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Standing back up]'' She's okay.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Actually, I think that one's a 'he'.}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob! There's some weird-looking fish watching us.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?! ''[voice calms down]'' No, no, it's okay Patrick. These weird-looking fish are with me!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[runs up to SpongeBob and Patrick holding a jellyfish net launcher]'' Hi y'all!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey Sandy!}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh, what's that?}}
{{L|Sandy|This is my jellyfish net launcher. ''[Shoots net at the camera]'' SpongeBob asked me to bring it to help show these fine fish what jellyfishing is all about!}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, I thought I was doing a pretty good job.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, where'd all the jellyfish go? Hmm... ''[looking around]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Looking around]'' They were just here.}}
{{L|Sandy|I wonder where they could be.}}
{{L|''[Gigantic swarm of jellyfish starts moving towards them, behind them]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's that noise? ''[Giant jellyfish swarm crashes into them and they all start to get lifted into the air by the jellyfish]'' Argh! Hang on you guys! Whoa!}}

{{L|Sandy|Aww, I dropped my net launcher!}}
{{L|Patrick|Look, it's a tiny Bikini Bottom!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick! We're up high!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh hey, I can see my rock from here! Hello, rock! ''[waving]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And there's the Krusty Krab! ''[pointing at Krusty Krab]'' Hi, Mr. Krabs! [waving]}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! Get back to work!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Jellyfish start wobbling on his feet]'' Dwah! Phew looks like the worst is over! ''[Jellyfish start rapidly moving again and then pulling them through]'' Argh! ''[Eyeballs get detached from his body and then he grabs them again as  the jellyfish are pulling him]''}}
{{L|Sandy|It's Goo Lagoon!}}
{{L|Patrick|I didn't bring my tanning butter.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, Squidward! ''[Bumps someone accidentally]'' 'Scuse me! Pardon me!}}
{{L|Sandy|Patrick! Look out! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick hit two changing booths and come out in bikinis]'' Y'all look ridiculous.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Jealous? Everyone okay back there? ''[Jellyfish lift them higher into the air again]'' Wow, we're in one huge herd of jellyfish.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah it's like they're running from something or something, or something.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasp]'' Look! They're trying to get away from that big truck!}}
{{L|Patrick|It's sucking them up!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We gotta help 'em.}}
{{L|Sandy|Well, boys, let's get to it! Hyah!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No! No! Argh! Argh!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[laughs evilly]'' Hello, SpongeBoob.}}

{{L|''[The truck goes over a ramp like hill and starts flying in the air]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[jumps in front of truck]'' I got it! I got it! I got it! ''[gets run over and muffles painfully]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Argh!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[evil laughs]'' You're just in time for the most exciting part of my latest and greatest plan. Behold! ''[pulls out chart]'' I'm draining these jellyfish of all their dangerous electricity so I can use it to destroy the Krusty Krab! ''[evil laugh]'' Pretty cool huh? Oh and I should also mention my ''[loud]'' electric cannon! Patent pending.}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy|''[being electrocuted by cannon]'' Argh! Ough! Argh!}}
{{L|Plankton|Later, jelly-lovers! Kiss-kiss!}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy|''[Dizzy and whimpering after being electrocuted]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We have to do something!}}
{{L|Sandy and Patrick|Yeah!}}
{{L|Patrick|Let's go get some milkshakes!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick! That's not what I mean.}}
{{L|''[The Flying Dutchman's ghostly ship crashes]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What was that?!}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|''[coming out of his ship]'' Argh! What is it now?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Screaming along with Patrick and Sandy. His face peels off revealing skeleton]''}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|First me seas are befouled with black sooty soot, and now a broken headlight! And me horoscope said it was going to be a good day. I hold all ye responsible for this calamity! I've a very special place for troublemakers the likes of you! ''[drags them on a rope through his ship]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob & Patrick|Yay! Special place!}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|Save your breath. You'll be needing it where you're going.}}
{{L|Patrick|That guy's skinny.}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|For your bad deeds, you're banished to... the perfume department/the disco dance floor/Swiss fondue party! ''[reveals one secret place]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[In the perfume department variant, they are being sprayed by giant realistic hands with perfume bottles and start running around in circles and SpongeBob says "Argh! Argh! Argh! My nose!" In the disco dance floor variant, they just dance and SpongeBob says "I got it! I got it!" In the Swiss fondue party variant, TBA]''}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|''[Laughs, then looks at Sandy]'' Hey! Why aren't you writhing in pain?}}
{{L|Sandy|''[taps water helmet]''}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|Oh.}}
{{L|Sandy|We didn't cause those toxins out there. Plankton did!}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|Well, why didn't they say so?}}
{{L|Sandy|Because they're... ''[looks at SpongeBob and Patrick run into each other]'' them!}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|C'mon then. We'll stop that shrimp with me cannons.}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy|''[Getting dragged into a room full of cannons]'' Ahh!}}
{{L|Patrick|Wow, they're sharp! ''[looking at weapons]''}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|Welcome to me cannon room.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, Plankton's on this little television. ''[looking through telescope]''}}
{{L|Sandy|That's a telescope, Patrick.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Looking through telescope]'' Oh my gosh! He's zapping the Krusty Krab! Take a look, guys! ''[camera goes into telescope revealing Plankton zapping the Krusty Krab with jellyfish electricity]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Plankton! Not me Krusty Krab!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We have to stop Plankton!}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|Nothing a couple of cannonballs can't fix! ''[Fires cannonball]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, what if we use this old net? ''[Fires it through cannon]''}}
{{L|The Flying Dutchman|You do know that net was tied to your leg, right?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[laughs]'' Wait. What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy|''[Flying out of the window screaming, connected to the rope of the net landing in front of SpongeBob's house]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi Gary! Hi Squidward! ''[starts getting pulled through downtown Bikini Bottom]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Downtown Bikini Bottom!}}
{{L|Plankton|The Krusty Krab will be mine!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh hey, there's Plankton's truck! ''[All crash into it]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh look, the jellyfish are free!}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, this looks like a perfect time for me to GET OUTTA HERE! ''[One jellyfish fires a net at him getting knocked into the camera]'' Oww!}}
{{L|Patrick|Where's SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm over here. ''[Big and absorbed]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[gasp]'' You're sucking in all of Plankton's yucky soot!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yep! We sponges are natural filters. ''[releases soot]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! Break's over!}}
{{L|Patrick|Smells pretty.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Fellow jelly fishers, I salute thee. You did real well for your first time out!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah! Not bad.}}
{{L|Sandy|Sayonara!}}
{{L|Patrick|That's French for goodbye!}}

{{L|''[Back to shot of ocean with small island]''}}
{{L|The French Narrator|And so our undersea journey comes to an end. Please be careful as you exit from the submersible, and please do not try to smuggle any jellyfish out in your pants. Believe me, you will regret it. Au revoir!}}
