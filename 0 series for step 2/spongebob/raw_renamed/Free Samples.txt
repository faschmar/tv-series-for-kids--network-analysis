{{L|''[Plankton laughs, squirts out chum onto a plate, smells the chum and laughs again. Karen comes out of the door.]''}}
{{L|Karen|What do I owe the excessive volume of this giggling?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[chuckles]'' You may thank my new and original idea, darling. ''[cut to Karen, who has a confused look on her face]'' Free samples! ''[cut back to Karen, who is still confused]''}}
{{L|Karen|New and original, my exhaust fan.}}
{{L|Plankton|Okay, so I didn't invent the concept, but I have improved upon it by removing the only obstacle to chum's success!}}
{{L|Karen|You mean the smell?  ''[Starts laughing]'' Smell. ''[Plankton is annoyed that she doesn't get what he says.}}
{{L|Plankton|''No''. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of ''my'' delicious chum, they'll tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free?! ''[cut to Plankton sitting on a bench near the store with free samples]'' Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!}}
{{L|Nat|Hey, what did he just say it was?}}
{{L|Plankton|I just said they're free!}}
{{L|Nat|Oh... I thought he said freaks. In that case... ''[he enters the line, and everyone else follows suit]'' So glad I actually left my house today.}}
{{L|''[everyone gets some chum]''}}
{{L|Plankton|That's the spirit, people. Step on up, but please take your time and be orderly. I wanna savor this whole "Putting-Krabs-out-of-business" business.}}
{{L|Sally|What is it?}}
{{L|Shubie|Oh, who cares silly-big-milly? It's free!}}
{{L|Sally|Oh, it's going to be so good 'cause it's free!}}
{{L|''[everyone starts putting the chum in their mouths then gets surprised]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Eat up. ''[Plankton laughs as Shubie holds her stomach. Nancy and Frank turn green, and the former's hair stands on end. Everyone is nauseous out of food poisoning.]'' Ugh. I have no idea that chum was this rotten. I better not be here when all this agony turns to anger. ''[Runs away with the tray]''}}
{{L|Nat|''[Believing Plankton robbed them, Nat gets up and is angry]'' Hey, he's making a run for it! We can't let him get away with this! Let's get up and... ''[Nat is nauseous again and retches; He speaks in a deep voice]'' get him.}}
{{L|''[everyone, still sick, chases Plankton. Patrick comes up to the stand]''}}
{{L|Patrick|"Free samples." ''[Patrick eats one of the chum and enjoys it]'' Yum! ''[Patrick eats more chum]''}}
{{L|''[everyone is standing outside the Chum Bucket. Frank the Lifeguard pounds on the door]''}}
{{L|Frank|Hey, you! I know you're in there!}}
{{L|Plankton|It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!}}
{{L|Karen|If Krabs gave away free samples, he probably wouldn't poison people thus tarnishing the good name of his restaurant.}}
{{L|Plankton|Yeah, I suppose you right, Karen. ''[Plankton gets an idea]'' Free Krabby Patties! Step up, step up, you'll never get this chance again, folks!}}
{{L|Harold|Free Krabby Patties?!}}
{{L|''[everyone runs to the stand again]''}}
{{L|Nat|Hey, what's all the hubbub?}}
{{L|Nazz|Oh, didn't ya hear? Someone's giving away free Krabby Patties!}}
{{L|Plankton|That's it. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Frank|''[Suspiciously]'' Hey, wait a minute. Aren't you the same guy what was giving away those rotten chum samples before?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[sweats nervously; lies]'' Oh, that wasn't me. That was... uh... my... brother-in-law, yeah, er, Flankton.}}
{{L|Lifeguard|Oh, okay.}}
{{L|''[everyone eats the chum, Frank's eyes pop out and his arms fall out]''}}
{{L|Lifeguard|''[dolphin chirp]''!}}
{{L|''[everyone else falls on Frank. Frankie Billy sees them, while eating chum. He shrugs and is about to leave, but tripped over and falls. Plankton comes out of the sewer]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Krabby Patties, anyone?}}
{{L|''[other people eat the chum, as a fish hurls. Meanwhile, SpongeBob goes to work.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[singing]'' I'm off to work, off to work, ready for grilling and fulfilling. ''[SpongeBob sees people by the Krusty Krab. At first, he sighs and calms down, believing they're hungry and impatient customers.]'' Those customers can't get enough Krabby Patties. Settle down folks: I'm here; I shall have your Krabby Patties before you shortly.}}
{{L|Nat|''[Pointing at SpongeBob]'' You!}}
{{L|Frank|You made those awful Krabby Patties what made my eyeballs fall out!}}
{{L|''[The people start to get furious. SpongeBob gets scared and slides into the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Over here boy. ''[Mr. Krabs is hiding by the table]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What is going on out there?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|The whole town has turned against me! And I have no idea why. ''[Frank throws a brick through the window. It has a note attached to it, which Mr. Krabs reads]'' "Because the Krabby Patty is terrible." ''[gasps in shock]'' Krabby Patty? Terrible?! How do those words even ''go'' together?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know, but we have do something to turn this situation around.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, you're right. We got to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, if you want to get customers ''in'' here, shouldn't we lower the prices?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[upset]'' Fine. ''[Mr. Krabs lowers the price from $2.99 to $2.98]'' How about that? ''[one of the customers throws rocks as the customers continue protesting]'' I'm ruined! ''[Mr. Krabs starts crying]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm all ears.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We simply give Krabby Patties away for fr- ''[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob's lips, completely shocked by this and is very reluctant to do this.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Don't you say it, boy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's the only way, Mr. Krabs. ''[Few minutes later, SpongeBob and very reluctant Mr. Krabs in Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob is holding a stand]'' Alright, sir, it's time.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Time? But it's too soon. ''[Mr. Krabs jumps to the stand, whimpering]'' I'm not ready to let them go free.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter ''how'' hard you fight me.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Gasps]'' I... I don't remember saying anything like that.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''I'' do. ''[SpongeBob pulls the sheet off, and Mr. Krabs screams]'' Free Krabby Patties! Get your totally and completely free of charge Krabby Patties!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Nooo! ''[Mr. Krabs tries to run to stop him from doing so, but his claws are suddenly in chains, which SpongeBob complied to do this to stop Mr. Krabs from stopping him.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's for your own good, Eugene. ''[On the loudspeaker]'' Free Krabby Patties, come and get your free Krabby Patties! ''[the word "patties" echoes]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Whew, for a second there, I thought we were gonna have to give away a ton of Krabby Patties, but it looks like ''free'' ain't even enough to jump start me business. ''[Suddenly has a nasty thought]'' Wait, free ain't even enough? Me business is doomed! ''[starts crying again]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[watching from atop a trash can]'' I really can't believe how well this is turning out for me today! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmm... Looks like it's time to pull out the big guns. ''[SpongeBob opens the small doors and plays the calliope]'' No one can resist the sweet sounds of a calliope.}}
{{L|Shubie|Hey look, Billy, a calliope.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[opens the door, revealing Squidward]'' Okay, Squidward. Here's your cup just like we rehearsed.}}
{{L|Squidward|Argh, I can't feel my legs.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Here let me help you, Squidward.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pulls Squidward's nose, tossing him in front of Billy]'' Hello.}}
{{L|Baby Billy|Look, mama, a monkey! ''[Billy throws a penny at Squidward]'' Dance, monkey, dance! Dance, monkey!}}
{{L|''[Squidward takes off his suit and gives it to Baby Billy]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I quit!}}
{{L|''[Squidward leaves in annoyance, while stomping on despondent Mr. Krabs, who is still crying.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait, Squidward, don't leave! We just can't give up yet!}}
{{L|''[Plankton laughs]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Sweet and delicious victory, you are mine!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob pulls up Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, we'll fix this.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[heartbroken]'' Not this time boy, it's all over for the good old Krusty Krab. It's probably best if you ''[sniffles]'' start looking for a new job, boy. Maybe in a different line of work.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sadly]'' New... Different... ''[SpongeBob gets an idea]'' That's it! ''[runs off]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, that went better than expected. Well only one thing left to do now. I'll have to move back with me ma. Hopefully she kept me posters up in me room.}}
{{L|French Narrator|Five minutes later...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Calling on ludspeaker]'' Krabby Patties, brand new Krabby Patty recipe, all new, all different, all delicious, try them for free!}}
{{L|Nazz|You can't be serious.}}
{{L|Frank|''[Sighs]'' I'm so hungry, I don't care, I gotta eat something.}}
{{L|Nazz|No! Wait!}}
{{L|Nat|''[Touches her shoulder]'' Let him go, it's too late.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|All new free Krabby Patties!}}
{{L|Frank|Hey, buddy, I'll try one. What have I got to lose? ''[everyone gasps as Frank eats half of the Krabby Patty]'' Dear Neptune Gill Sacks, this is the best thing I every put in my mouth! Yay! ''[Frank's shirt turns pink, then goes back to normal]''}}
{{L|Nazz|Did he just say it was good?}}
{{L|''[Frank finishes the other half of the Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|Frank|Woohoo! ''[Frank dances]''}} 
{{L|Nat|Wow, Frank never dances, it must be good!}}
{{L|''[everyone eats the Krabby Patties, Henry-Bart's eyes turn into a thumbs up, money comes out of his skin]''}}
{{L|Henry-Bart|I'm getting something this amazing for free! How much will this buy? ''[Henry-Bart throws money on SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Frank|Yum yum! Yum yum yum yum! Yum yuuuum! ''[Frank goes like a rocket]'' Hey you, patty boy, take my wallet, I gotta have more! ''[Frank goes in the stand and takes two Krabby Patties]''}}
{{L|''[Nat and the Fish's heads turn into arms and give a high-five]''}}
{{L|Nat and Nazz|Now that's what I'm talking about!}}
{{L|''[Nat and Nazz's head turn back to normal, they get a briefcase from their pockets]''}}
{{L|Nat|Here's our life savings! Just give us more Krabby Patties! ''[Nat and Nazz dump the money on SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|''[cut to Plankton talking on a cellphone]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Don't worry, Karen, I'll be home before lunch time. My mission here is accomplished. ''[laughs, and then a dollar bill lands on Plankton]'' Ooh. What the... huh?! ''[gasps]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's working!}}
{{L|Plankton|No, wait! What's going on? You ''hate'' Krabby Patties, remember?}}
{{L|Dump truck driver|Wowee, this thing is right tasty.}}
{{L|Plankton| ''[a dump truck prepares to dump money]'' Uh-oh. ''[the money lands on Plankton]''}} 
{{L|''[a helicopter dumps a bag full of money on SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs is just walking and then a dollar lands on his nose. His eyes pop out and he screams so loudly, Plankton comes out of the money]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[While running towards the mountain of money]'' Money, money, money, money, money, money! ''[Mr. Krabs jumps on the money and laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We did it, Mr. Krabs! We saved the Krusty Krab! All I did was sell the same old Krabby Patties, and call them new!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Do you mind? I'm trying to make a money angel here.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, money angels! Can I make one?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Sure thing, SpongeBob. Hop in! ''[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh. Plankton screams because Mr. Krabs is sitting on him]'' Did you hear that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hear what?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hm. Good point. ''[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue laughing]''}}
