{{L|''[In the city part of Bikini Bottom, everyone screams and points at a giant Plankton robot as it grabs a handful of people in each hand and drops them inside the Chum Bucket.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[everyone running around inside]'' Oh, good, the lunch rush. Now that my ChumBot has dropped you into my clutches, you'll be forced to eat at the Chum Bucket. ''[everyone stops in their tracks]''}}
{{L|Nat|What?! You mean you kidnapped us just to sell us your fast food?}}
{{L|Plankton|Come on, it's a standard marketing technique. ''[people leave]''}}
{{L|Nat|You little twerp!}}
{{L|Plankton|Hey!}}
{{L|Karen|He's right, ya know.}}
{{L|Plankton|Karen?! You think I'm a twerp?}}
{{L|Karen|Well, yes, but I was referring to the kidnapping.}}
{{L|Plankton|Everything I do is always wrong in your eyes.}}
{{L|Karen|Maybe it's because you are always wrong.}}
{{L|Plankton|Fine. I'm wrong, you're right.}}
{{L|Karen|You said it, not me. You know, you're lucky to have me.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[walking away]'' Why did I ever install that nagging software?}}
{{L|Karen|Nagging software? I heard that! Come back and dust my screen!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, money. You're always there for me. ''[kissing noisily]''}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Hello, Eugene}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Mother! Uh, what brings ya by today?}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|I just wanted to see my favorite son.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|How much of my money do you want?}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Well, I did see the prettiest hat in town today.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, look at the time! So sorry to have to rush off. Bye! ''[pushes Mama Krabs out his office and closes his door]'' Whew, that was a close one.}}
{{L|Plankton|Why did I ever buy that computer wife? I need a real woman - not a girl in a cold-hearted shell. ''[Plankton hears Mama Krabs humming outside so he brings down his periscope on her]'' Such beauty. She's an angel; and no wires. I've never felt like this before. I don't even know her name and yet she's stolen my heart.}}
{{L|Karen|Plankton! You've fallen in love with another woman?! I'm your wife!}}
{{L|Plankton|You're a W.I.F.E. ''[pulls out chart]'' '''W'''ired '''I'''ntegratred '''F'''emale '''E'''lectroencephalograph.}}
{{L|Karen|Oh, you always pull that one out! "You're not a real wife, you're just a computer!"}}
{{L|Plankton|''[sighing]'' Why don't you have an 'off' switch? ''[sees an off switch and smiles]''}}
{{L|Karen|Plankton, don't you dare... ''[turns off]''}}
{{L|Plankton|And now to woo that beloved creature. ''[cut to Mama Krabs taking a nap while ChumBot is looking through her window. Then the robot grabs her]''}}
{{L|ChumBot|Roses are red. Violets are blue. World domination has nothing on you. ''[she screams]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Hmmm, I guess she's not a poetry fan. ''<nowiki>[everyone is running around screaming while the robot is using its eye laser to spell out "I â™¥ You" on the ground, but while destroying some of the town when doing this. Mama Krabs reads it and screams a few times]</nowiki>'' Poetry, love notes--nothing's working. Maybe something personal. ''[Mama Krabs is shrieking. The robot walks over to a rock and karate chops a memorial-like statue of Mama Krabs' head and puts her down]''}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|''[stops screaming]'' Am I really that pretty?}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, yeah... I am smooth. ''[cut to later in his restaurant by a phone]'' Just dial the number and ask her to dinner. C'mon, you can do this. ''[dial tones beeping; Plankton grunting]''}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Hello? ''[Plankton panting in the phone]'' I'm hanging up.}}
{{L|Plankton|Wait! It's your secret admirer.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Oh, you're that giant robot?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[laughing]'' No. I program the robot. Did you enjoy the gift I sent you?}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|How did you know I wanted a hat? Have you been spying on me? ''[6 TV screens are set-up to in different parts of Mama Krabs house]''}}
{{L|Plankton|It was...just a lucky guess. I've admired you from afar for far too long, my angel. We must meet face-to-face.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Well, how about the Krusty Krab? Tonight at 8:00?}}
{{L|Plankton|Sounds wonderful. I'll be the tall fellow wearing a red carnation. Until tonight, my dear. ''[cut to Mama Krabs walking into the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ah! Quick, SpongeBob, swallow me wallet!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|OK. ''[Mr. Krabs shoves his wallet in SpongeBob's mouth and SpongeBob swallows it]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, sorry, Mommy. I can't lend you any money. SpongeBob accidentally swallowed me wallet. ''[sniffs his mother's hat]'' Mommy, you got yourself a hat without my financial assistance.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Isn't it nice, Eugene? It's just the one I wanted.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But Mommy, you shouldn't be spending me inheritance... I mean, since, you told me you wanted a hat, I went out and I dug one up. ''[takes out a hat with holes in it]''}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Where did you get this old thing? ''[at a funeral where two fish are paying their respects to the person in the coffin]''}}
{{L|Nat|She looks so peaceful.}}
{{L|Fred|Yeah. But wasn't she wearing a hat? ''[Mr. Krabs is seen running out with the hat behind him]''}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|You can take this back to the trash heap.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes, Mommy. ''[tosses hat and shovel to Squidward]'' Squidward, I need you to make a return for me.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Thank ye for your concern for my finances, but me new boyfriend bought me this hat.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Boyfriend? Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|I don't know. I'm meeting him here, tonight.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wonderful! I'll stay open late so ye can have a nice, romantic dinner. Run along, make yourself pretty. SpongeBob, you're working late tonight. No overtime! ''[SpongeBob lunges himself into the door. Cut to Plankton wearing a rose, walking into the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is in a waiter uniform]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[clears throat]'' I've reservations for two, tonight.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Right this way, sir. ''[SpongeBob pulls back the chair for Plankton as he jumps up on it]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[shouts]'' Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Terribly sorry, sir. ''[reaches into his pocket and takes out a miniature table and chair. Places it on top of the big table, then grabs Plankton and places him in the chair]'' Will there be anything else?}}
{{L|Plankton|Is my tie on straight?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You look fabulous! ''[Mama Krabs walks in]'' Your gentlemen caller awaits. ''[Mama Krabs walks up to the table]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[pulls rose away from his body]'' Hello, my dear. I must say you look ravishing tonight. ''[Mama Krabs notices Plankton]''}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Oh, my, you're a tiny thing, but awfully cute. Tell me about yourself. ''[sits down in a chair that SpongeBob has brought to her]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, I'm in the food service business. I'm a bit of a restaurateur. I'm the founder and owner of the Chum Bucket.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Never heard of it.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Points to the Chum Bucket]'' It's across the street.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Doesn't ring a bell. ''[Plankton shows her the back of a phone book with a picture of him and the Chum Bucket]''}}
{{L|Plankton|It's on the back of the phone book! Come on! I paid a lotta money for that ad! ''[Puts the book away]'' Never mind, never mind. I'd like to hear about you.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Well...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|Krabs!}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Eugene!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Mommy?}}
{{L|Plankton|"Mommy?"}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[jumps in the air]'' SpongeBob!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob...!}}
{{L|Plankton|This delectable creature is your mother?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|This no-good conniving chiseler is your date!?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And this devilishly handsome sponge is your waiter.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! I don't know what sort of skulduggery you're up to, Plankton, and I'm not waiting to find out. ''[picks up Plankton by his antennae]''}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Eugene, you better put me boyfriend down, this instant!}}
{{L|Plankton|Boyfriend?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But, mommy...}}
{{L|Plankton|You heard the lady. Let me go. ''[Mr. Krabs drops him into Mama Krabs' hand]''}}
{{L|Plankton|That's more like it.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Come, Plankton. I'm sorry me son had to spoil our romantic evening.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Mommy? ''[cut to Plankton cleaning a picture of Mama Krabs then in walks Mr. Krabs]'' You!}}
{{L|Plankton|Eugene.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I came to warn you, Plankton. Stay away from me mother. I know what you're really up to.}}
{{L|Plankton|I'm serious, Eugene. I've changed my ways. And all it took was the love of a beautiful woman.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|All you like is thieving and conniving. Now, stop trying to get the formula out of me mother.}}
{{L|Plankton|What are you talking about?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm talking about the Krabby Patty formula!}}
{{L|Plankton|Your mother knows the Krabby Patty formula?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Don't play stupid with me. Of course she does. It's an old Krabs family recipe, and ''you're'' not family! ''[Plankton frowns]'' I'm telling you for the last time: stay away from me mother. ''[walks out]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Not family, eh? Well, I can fix that. ''[cut to Mama Krabs walking into the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Eugene!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Mommy!}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|What did I tell ye about interfering in me life?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Mommy, can't you see? He's trying to seduce the Krabby Patty formula right from under you.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|For your information, Eugene, he hasn't asked me once about the formula. I doubt that he even knows that I know it.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[chuckles nervously, pulling his shirt as he realizes he let that slip needlessly.]'' Uh, yeah...funny thing about that.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|I forbid ye to interfere in me private business. Go to your office, now!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes, mommy. ''[walks into his office]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Somebody call heaven because I think an angel's gone missing.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Oh, Sheldon.}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, Mrs. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, brother.}}
{{L|Plankton|Attention, attention, everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. Mrs. Krabs, in full view of this restaurant, I ask you for your hand in holy matrimony.}}
{{L|Crowd|Aw!}}
{{L|Plankton|Would you marry me? ''[a big diamond ring is shown up close]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ah, that's it! No more hiding in my room like a scared little kid, it's time to act like a man! '' [he flies, screaming, and jumps at Plankton]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Gasp!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[jumps in his mother's lap]'' Please don't marry him, mommy! Don't marry this bad, bad man! I don't want you to!}}
{{L|Plankton|Too late, Krabsy. We're going to be married. And you're gonna be my new son! ''[laughs maniacally. Mama Krabs hands the ring back to Plankton]'' Huh? What's this, honey bunch?}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|I'm flattered by your offer, really I am, but I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment. ''[Mr. Krabs laughs]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What is this? There's somebody else, isn't there?}}
{{L|ChumBot|''[breaks into Krusty Krab with flowers]'' I... I... this is very uncomfortable. I'll just wait in the car.}}
{{L|Plankton|I don't believe this! You led me on!}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Now, now Plankton, it's not what you think.}}
{{L|Plankton|I don't wanna hear your lies! You owe me for leading on like this! Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|The formula? Is that what this whole thing was about?}}
{{L|Plankton|No! No, not really. I mean... not at first. I mean uh... Uh, honey bunch? ''[Mama Krabs shows her muscles, which show a ship's cannons]'' Uh-oh. ''[she punches Plankton back to the Chum Bucket]'' Oh, well. Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all! ''[Plankton ends up flying into the ON switch of Karen.]''}}
{{L|Karen|Working.}}
{{L|Plankton|So, you decided to come crawling back to me, huh?}}
{{L|Karen|''[beginning to zap Plankton]'' What did you say?}}
{{L|Plankton|Nothing. Nothing, dear.}}
{{L|Karen|''[zaps Plankton]'' Yeah. That's what I thought you said, honey bunch.}}
{{L|Plankton|Ow!}}
