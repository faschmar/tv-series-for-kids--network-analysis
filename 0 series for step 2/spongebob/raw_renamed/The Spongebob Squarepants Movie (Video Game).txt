===Console versions===
====No Cheese====
{{L|Narrator|Welcome to our little tale of woe, triumph against impossible odds, terror, and managerly responsibility. Our story begins in the calm waters above the town of Bikini Bottom. As we descend beneath the waves, we find another day... Wait a minute! Hold your seahorses!}}

====I'm Ready... Depression====
{{L|Phil|Who are you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm the manager of this establishment. Everything is going to be just fine.}}
{{L|Phil|I'm really scared, man!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You got a name?}}
{{L|Phil|Phil. (Cries)}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on, Phil. Stay with me. I've only got one shot at this. Gotta have the right tool for the job. Bingo. Now, I want you to do me a favor, Phil.}}
{{L|Phil|What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Say, "Cheese".}}
{{L|Narrator|Ah, the beginning. Our little yellow friend awakes from his slumber, and prepares for the biggest day of his life. Yet, despite his dreams, he is not honored with the manager position of the new Krusty Krab 2. So, he sulks off to drown his depression in ice cream, at the local Goofy Goober's. Across the street, jealous of Mr. Krabs' success, the diabolical Plankton hatches "Plan Z": he steals King Neptune's crown, and frames Mr. Krabs for selling it to the far-off and dangerous land, of Shell City. Let us now join our heroes in the midst of their self-pity.}}

====Sandwich Driving 101====
{{L|SpongeBob|There you are, Patrick. I've been trying to find you all evening.}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh, it's eight in the morning, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, my gosh, eight o'clock! I am late for work! Mr. Krabs is gonna kill me! Oh, Mr. Krabs...}}
{{L|Narrator|Back at the Krusty Krab, King Neptune confronts Mr. Krabs about his alleged thievery. He asks if there's anyone present who may vouch for Mr. Krabs' character. And, our yellow Knucklehead-McSpazitron shows up to accuse Mr. Krabs of being a horrible person. King Neptune zaps Mr. Krabs, causing SpongeBob to sober up quickly. He selflessly volunteers to journey to Shell City and retrieve the King's crown. Freezing Mr. Krabs in place, King Neptune grants a six-day reprieve, so SpongeBob and Patrick may attempt to retrieve the crown. King Neptune's daughter, Mindy, provides SpongeBob and Patrick with a magic mirror, through which she can communicate and assist our heroic duo. We continue, as SpongeBob and Patrick arrive at the Patty Wagon.}}

====Three... Thousand Miles to Shell City====
{{L|Narrator|With the chaos of Bikini Bottom behind it, SpongeBob and Patrick begin their long journey towards Shell City. However, with SpongeBob gone, all is not well. Plankton is now selling the Krabby Patty at the Chum Bucket, and with every purchase, customers are getting a mind-controlling bucket helmet. Squidward has discovered Plankton's plan to create an army of bucketheads. Will Squidward save the day? No. On the outskirts of town, SpongeBob and Patrick meet some of the charming locals, who tell them they will not last long outside the city. But, our friends, did not listen. They should have listened. Our heroes are now stranded in a vast desert, with only their feet for transportation.}}

====Bubble Blowing Baby Hunt====
{{L|Narrator|Our heroes, having foiled Plankton's evil plans, continue across the desert. But, Plankton remains one stubby step ahead of them. He sends someone to make sure that they will fail. He is a vicious, ruthless killer named Dennis. Fortunately, SpongeBob and Patrick have discovered the patty wagon in a parking lot, but the key is missing. So, the only thing to do, is to go into the Thug Tug bar and look for it. Good luck, my friends. You're going to need it.}}

====Rock Slide====
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, step on it! (Screaming)}}
{{L|Ice Cream Lady|Come on, kiddies. Have some ice cream.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Jump for it, Patrick!}}
{{L|Narrator|And so, the hideous creature was vanquished by an even more hideous creature coming from the deep ocean trench.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, we lost our car again.}}
{{L|Patrick|Never mind the car, where's the road?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|There's the road! On the other side of the deep, dark, dangerous, monster-infested trench. (They gulp)}}
{{L|Narrator|After gulping, SpongeBob and Patrick decided to throw in the towel. Luckily, Mindy arrived, and showed them what was really going on back in Bikini Bottom. Plankton had transformed Bikini Bottom into Planktopolis. The sight of their city, convinced our heroes to continue on to Shell City. So, in order to become men, they cried like little babies. But, someone was hot on their tail. With no time to lose, Princess Mindy thought of a better idea, and our heroes quickly became men, and marched toward the treacherous trench.}}

====Shell City, Dead Ahead====
{{L|Narrator|And that, is how SpongeBob and Patrick escaped the trench full of hideous, disgusting monsters. Meanwhile, Dennis continues to follow our heroes. Some unsavory types attempt to get in his way, but he manages to reason with them. And so, like two tin cans in a trash compactor, SpongeBob and Patrick continue on, blissfully unaware of the danger closing in on them. Standing in their way, is a field full of stinky garbage. But with Shell City somewhere on the other side, they have no choice, but to push on.}}

====Sundae Driving====
{{L|Dennis|Finally, I got you right where I want you.}}
{{L|Patrick|That's a big boot!}}
{{L|Dennis|Don't worry! This'll only hurt a lot! (Evil laughing) I love this job! (Gets squashed by a bigger boot)}}
{{L|Patrick|(trys runs away) Bigger boot!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait, Pat. This bigger boot saved our lives.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yay! (With SpongeBob) Thank you, stranger.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's the Cyclops! Run!}}
{{L|Narrator|And so, SpongeBob and Patrick escaped the clutches of the mad, murderous Dennis, only to be captured by even more hideous Cyclops! And then, they passed out, awakening in a greenie, Goofy Goober wonderland where-- Huh? Wait a minute.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, it's the Goofy Goober. Patrick, there's the Goofy Goober himself!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, boy.}}
{{L|Narrator|As I was saying? SpongeBob and Patrick continued on, allowing nothing to distract them.}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Patrick|Goofy Goober, Goofy Goober, yeah!}}
{{L|Narrator|It's just a dream, don't waste your time! Eh, go ahead.}}

====Google Eyes and Smelly Knick Knacks====
{{L|Narrator|When SpongeBob and Patrick awakened from their sweet dreams of ice cream sundaes, and dancing peanuts, they discover that they have become prisoners of the Cyclops. For you see, gentle viewers, our heroes had at long last made it to Shell City, and had discovered its awful secret. Shell City was nothing more than a souvenir shop. Those who are captured were dried up and turned into smelly knick-knacks! And that is precisely what was happening to our two friends. The situation seemed to be completely, and utterly, hopeless. But they were saved by the tear of the Goofy Goober, as well as a conveniently placed sprinkler system. King Neptune's crown lay nearby, but our heroes still needed to escape the treacherous depths of Shell City, and get past their most dangerous adversary, the Cyclops.}}

====Dennis Strikes Back!====
{{L|Narrator|And so, after escaping the hideous fate that awaited them in the clutches of the Cyclops, SpongeBob and Patrick find themselves standing on the beach, staring out at the vastness of the ocean.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How are we going to get back to Bikini Bottom?}}
{{L|David Hasselhoff|(appears) I can take you there.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Who are you?}}
{{L|Hasselhoff|I'm not a lifeguard, but I play one on TV.}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Patrick|Hooray!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So, uh, where's your boat?}}
{{L|Hasselhoff|"Boat"? (Laughing)}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hooray! Nothing can stop us now! Bikini Bottom, here we come!}}

====Welcome to Planktopolis... Minions====
{{L|SpongeBob|Yay, Patrick! We did it!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hooray for SpongeBob and Patrick!}}
{{L|Dennis|(comes back via Cyclops' boot) Now, where were we?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait, Dennis! Uh, look out, behind you!}}
{{L|Dennis|That's it! I'm through messing around! See you later, fools! (Hears honking) Huh? (Screaming when seeing a catamaran, and he dies)}}
{{L|Patrick|Goodbye.}}
{{L|Narrator|After many adventures, our heroes arrived back home. But it is a much, much different place from the one they left. Where there once was rolling green fields and bustling city streets, there is now Planktopolis. Our city is dark and twisted as the heart of its teeny tiny ruler. All of Bikini Bottom's familiar faces are now covered by unfashionable mind-controlling buckets. And perhaps most horrible of all, King Neptune is at the Krusty Krab 2, preparing to fry Mr. Krabs. Bikini Bottom's only hope rests with a small, yellow sponge, and a pink sea star. Can they survive the dangers of Planktopolis? Oh, let us hope so.}}

====Aftermath====
{{L|Plankton|Kill him. Kill him, you idiot!}}
{{L|King Neptune|"Idiot"?!}}
{{L|Plankton|Uh, no, no, idiot's... (Chuckles nervously) uh, French for a "Handsome Man". (Gets stunned by the Power of Music and is taken to the police)}}
{{L|King Neptune|Eugene Krabs. It looks like you were innocent the whole time. Oh, well. That's why pencils have erasers. And now, to thank the brave heroes who recovered my crown, and saved Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick, you have performed a manly deed.}}
{{L|Mindy|I'm so proud of you!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, Mindy. I've learned a few things about myself. I may be a dork, and a wingnut.}}
{{L|Patrick|And knucklehead-mcspazitron.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes! But more importantly, I'm a kid, and I like being a kid. I'm just glad that everything is back to normal.}}
{{L|Narrator|And so ends the most heroic tale ever told, in Bikini Bottom. And as the sun sets over the island paradise above the waves, we must stop and wonder, how long until the sequel? Depends on the box office. Now, go outside and get some sun! You look awfully pale.}}

===GBA Version===
{{L|SpongeBob|Woohoo! I'm ready! Promotion! Time to get to the Krusty Krab for my big day! I'm going to be the manager of the Krusty Krab 2!}}
{{L|Plankton|It's diabolical. Plan Z can't possibly fail! I must take King Neptune's crown!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Sorry, SpongeBob, you have to be a MAN to be a manager. You're just a kid. }}
{{L|Plankton|King Neptune's crown, safe and sound?}}
{{L|King Neptune|What the? My crown! It's GONE!}}
{{L|Plankton|Whoever wears the crown is in charge of the sea! Hee hee hee. Plan Z. I love Plan Z.}}
{{L|King Neptune|Eugene Krabs, you shall remain frozen until my crown is returned. All clues point to you! Crown taker!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll prove I'm a man by getting that crown back! Mr. Krabs I will save you and the crown! Quick, to the Patty Wagon! Let's go get that crown, Pat. Woohoo! We're about to cross the county line! Nothing's going to stop us from manhood now!}} 
{{L|Patrick|Let's talk to that vehicle inspector.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.}}
{{L|Thug fish|You babies better step aside.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|He just took the Patty Wagon. I don't think he was the vehicle inspector.}}
{{L|Patrick|Ummmmm, I don't think he's coming back.}}
{{L|Mindy|Welcome to my palace. Use your Golden Clams to make a purchase. Would you like to buy an item today? This is an extra life. You can never have too many of these! This is a secret. What could it be? Are you sure you want to leave? Goodbye.}} 
{{L|Thug Tug thug|You guys must be the baby face baby heads. Time to take you down.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|No sir, you must have mistaken us for some other baby face baby heads.}} 
{{L|Patrick|Ummmm. Yeah!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The key! I can't believe he had the key to the Patty Wagon. And there's the Patty Wagon! Back to the man quest!}} 
{{L|Ice Cream Monster|Come here my sweets. Come and get your ice cream, my sweets!}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Um, no thank you scary tongue grandma in a monster's mouth.}}
{{L|Patrick|Mmmm. Ice cream.}}
{{L|Mindy|Thank goodness I caught you before you went into that dangerous trench! Close your eyes and I will turn you into men with my mermaid magic.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now it's time to unleash the manliness of our mustaches}}. 
{{L|Patrick|That trench was no match for two such manly man.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on, Pat, time's a wastin'. We gotta get the crown and save the town.}}
{{L|Dennis|Someone very powerful has sent me to destroy you two!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You better move aside, because you're talking to some mighty men. We don't want to have to hurt ya.}} 
{{L|Patrick|Yeah! Just look at our mustaches!}}
{{L|Dennis|You mean those fake seaweed mustaches... HA HA HA!}} 
{{L|Patrick|It's the Cyclops!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ayyieeeeeee! He's coming for us! Heh? Are we dead? Is it? Could it be? It is! It's... Shell City!}}
{{L|Cyclops|Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We gotta get past this guy, or we're never going to get back to Bikini Bottom in time. Maybe if he couldn't see us, then we could leave? Woohoo, we did it! We escaped from Shell City!}}
{{L|Patrick|Now how do we get back to Bikini Bottom?}}
{{L|David Hasselhoff|I'm David Hasselhoff. I will take you back!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Woohoo!}}
{{L|Dennis|Did you miss me?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams]''}}
{{L|Dennis|Now where were we}}
{{L|Patrick|He put us in his man chest, such control...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gee, Patrick, who would've thought Hasselhoff waxes?}}
{{L|David Hasselhoff|All hands on deck! Hang on! My manly chest blast will get you back to Bikini Bottom!}}
