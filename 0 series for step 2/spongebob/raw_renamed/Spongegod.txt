{{L|Mr. Krabs|Not free!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|♪And if I saw a frown, "Aha!" I'd turn it upside down!♪ ''[Squidward's frown into smile, smile burns, Squidward muffles]'' ♪And as for toxic waste, I don't care for the taste.♪ ''[face turns green and peels]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[telling beside Patrick's head]'' ♪So listen to my scheme. I'd change it into ice creeeam!♪ ''[toxic waste becomes ice cream, singing stops]''}}
