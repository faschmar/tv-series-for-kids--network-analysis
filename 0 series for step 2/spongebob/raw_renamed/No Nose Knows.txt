{{L|''[Episode starts with Squidward walking home. He places his keys on the table, and puts down a bag that says "Nautical Mart" on it. He then takes some stuff out]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I thought I told that kid not to put the organic sea cucumber on top of the free range anemones! Well, at least my flowers survived the trip. ''[sniffs it, then SpongeBob's nose is in his nostril, he screams, then sneezes him out]'' SpongeBob, would you please find your own flowers to sniff?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What about Patrick? Does he have to find his own flowers, too? ''[Patrick pops up from the flowers, and they die]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What are you talking about, nitwit? He doesn't even have a nose!}}
{{L|Patrick|Of course I have a nose, Squidward. Why, it's as plain as the nose on my... ''[human hands touch his face, then he talks sadly]'' ...face? ''[touches Squidward's nose, then his face, then SpongeBob's nose]'' You're right, Squidward! ''[cries, his tears flooded the floor]''}}
{{L|Squidward|My floors! Think fast, Squiddy. I've got your nose.}}
{{L|Patrick|You do?}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah. I've got it... ''[touches Patrick's face, and holds his thumb, looking like a nose]'' ...right here.}}
{{L|Patrick|Give me! Give it here!}}
{{L|Squidward|If you want it, you gotta go get it. ''[pretends to throw it, then they run outside, and Squidward shuts the door. They then look around]''}}
{{L|Patrick|There! ''[picks up a shell]'' Well, SpongeBob, what do you think of my new nose?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, that's not a nose! That's a... ''[a hermit crab bites him and Patrick yelps]'' ...hermit crab.}}
{{L|Patrick|I guess I'll always be a noseless freak. ''[cuts to them walking down the street]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's not so abnormal to be noseless. Just look around. Lots of fish don't have noses.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, but all my friends have noses. You, Squidward, Sandy, even Mr. Krabs! ''[Mr. Krabs walks on screen sniffing around, then sees a penny]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|There you are! ''[picks it up and continues sniffing]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face?}}
{{L|Patrick|I can do that? ''[cuts to Patrick with a false nose tied on him]''}}
{{L|Surgeon|Well, what do you think?}}
{{L|Patrick|Sorry, doc. I don't really think it's me.}}
{{L|Surgeon|That's a-okay. That's cool. As lead surgeon here, I take a hypothetical oath. Which means I will not stop, I will not rest, I will not cut a single toenail, until the customer is 100% satisfied! So please, browse our extensive wall of noses! And I will patiently await your final decision.}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay! Let's see. Hmm. ''[looks around]''}}
{{L|Surgeon|Excellent choice! ''[puts him on a medical bed. Scene cuts to him walking out of the nose store, with a nose bandaged up]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|All right, Patrick, let's unveil the new schnoze! ''[tries to pull off the bandages, but Patrick stops him]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Wait, stop, careful, SpongeBob! This fragile stitching requires tender care. Allow me to carefully remove the bandages. ''[crushes his nose, then pulls off the bandages, then uses a cooking mixer, then a sander]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|There it is, Patrick! Your brand new sniffer! Looking good, buddy! ''[silence for a few seconds]'' Well, I've gotta go to work now. Have fun with your new nose.}}
{{L|Patrick|I will! Now, how do I use this thing? ''[smells something]'' What is that smell? ''[walks over to a bakery]'' Pastries? I never knew they smelled so good! ''[sticks his face in and sniffs them]''}}
{{L|Fred|Well, I guess I won't be eating those. ''[cuts to Squidward walking out of the Nautical Mart with more flowers]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Let's see Patrick destroy these. ''[Patrick sniffs them all in his nose, then he is sitting on a lawn mower smelling the grass, then putting on deodorant, and sniffing his armpit. He then smells some bread, and floats toward it. He then floats through a cloud of perfume a lady is putting on]''}}
{{L|Patrick|All these years I knew I was missing out on something, but I never thought smelling could be this good! ''[smells a bad smell, then falls]'' What is that horrible smell? ''[notices something]'' Onion rings? ''[sniffs them, then screams and covers his nose]'' The scent! Nobody told me about bad smells! ''[a bad smell taps him on the shoulder]'' What is it now? ''[sniffs some trash, then runs away from the stench]'' I'm going to have to re-think this whole smelling thing. ''[runs into his rock, and the smell vanishes. Patrick sits in his chair]'' I made it. At least here at home, I can't be attacked by those wretched odors. ''[smells a bad smell again]'' Bad smells are all around me! ''[takes a look at all the trash. His eyes then water up, and he runs outside]'' I cannot live in these conditions! ''[puts a mask on his nose, then gets some cleaning spray and a brush. He then runs to his rock to clean it]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|48 hours later... ''[Patrick's house is really clean, and he is still cleaning]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hiya, Patrick. How... Whoa! Hey, looking good.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, the smells! They're everywhere! It's unbearable! ''[cries and Patrick's crying sounded like Squidward, then Squidward walks on screen]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What's wrong with the pinhead? ''[Patrick smells something, and screams]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, it's another one! No! I can't take it!}}
{{L|Squidward|Where do you think you're going?}}
{{L|Patrick|To do what should have been done long ago. ''[barges into Squidward's house, then smells something, and opens his fridge, revealing bad smelling cheese ''[Ã„delost?]'', then screams]'' Sweet Neptune, imported cheese! ''[runs off screen, then comes back with a mask and sack]'' This is inexcusable! ''[puts it in the sack]'' Yuck!}}
{{L|Squidward|What are you doing with my cheese?}}
{{L|Patrick|It's rotten garbage now. ''[throws it in the garbage, then blasts it with a rocket launcher]'' That's better.}}
{{L|Squidward|That was my cheese. It's ''supposed'' to smell like that, kelp for brains!}}
{{L|Patrick|You are sick, Squidward. ''[smells another bad smell]'' Bad smell again! ''[looks out the window, and we see SpongeBob working out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|1, 2, 3, 4... ''[has trouble lifting the weight again]'' Come on, '''SquarePants''', be a man! ''[lifts it up]''}}
{{L|Patrick|You! ''[SpongeBob is scared, and drops the weight on him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, help!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[throws the weight off him]'' Oh, I'll help you, all right! Help stop you from polluting our world with your sweaty holes. ''[plugs up SpongeBob's holes with corks]'' There.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't work at the Krusty Krab looking like this. I'm out of uniform.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, you can't go to work smelling like that. You should be thanking me, SpongeBob. ''[smells another bad smell]'' Smells like... something greasy. ''[cuts to the Krusty Krab]'' Nobody moves! I am ridding this place of its disgusting stench with these scented candles! ''[puts a candle on a table. Fred tries to eat a Krabby Patty, but can't]''}}
{{L|Fred|''[coughs]'' My mouth can't take these conflicting flavors! Agh! ''[walks away, then Patrick puts scented candles on every table]''}}
{{L|Patrick|This air freshener should finish the job. ''[sprays it, then everyone coughs. Patrick then puts a candle on the cashier boat]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What the barnacles do you think you're doing?! You're chasing away all me customers! ''[everyone leaves]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, good! No one should have to eat in this stench!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[outraged at what Patrick has just said]'' What?! Why, I got a good mind to...}}
{{L|Patrick|Say no more, you can thank me later. Right now, I've got many more stink holes to swab clean.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, that new honker of his has turned him into a complete jerk! ''[Patrick walks outside, and Sandy walks past him]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Hiya, Pat. ''[Patrick sprays Sandy with the air freshener. Sandy screams, then coughs]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Take a bath, fleabag! ''[cuts to the Krusty Krab. Where Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Sandy, and SpongeBob are there]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I've asked you all here because we all face a similar problem. The problem bein' a sea star with a nose that's gotten way out of hand! ''[all except SpongeBob agree]''}}
{{L|Squidward|You got that right, yeah!}}
{{L|Sandy|Yeah!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now what I want to know is, are we going to do something about it!? ''[all except SpongeBob agree again]''}}
{{L|Squidward|You bet we're gonna do, yeah!}}
{{L|Sandy|Yeah, sure are!}}
{{L|Squidward|Let's give him what for!}}
{{L|Sandy|Let's hogtie him and run him out of town on a rail! ''[all, except SpongeBob agree again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in thought bubble]'' Come on, '''SpongeBob''', be a man! ''[talking]'' Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Not now, boy! We're in the middle of a public listen! That no-good, nose-flartin...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It is not Patrick's fault!}}
{{L|All|Huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's the new nose that has betrayed us. My grandma SquarePants always says, punish the nose, not the man. But we're going to need something foul, something beyond foul, a stench that will blow the socks off his fungus-infested socks! ''[cuts to them pushing a giant stinky ball toward Patrick's house, in air suits, so they won't smell it]'' Okay, this should be stinky enough. I've gathered every sweaty sock, moldy pizza, and rotten piece of fruit in Bikini Bottom. ''[puts a nasty slimy messy pepper on the garbage ball]'' With a little raw sewage for good measure.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Attaboy! Now for the moment of truth!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, sir! ''[knocks on Patrick's rock and runs away]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hello. ''[smells the bad smell, casing his nose to cough, then dry and shrivel out]'' No! ''[his nose than falls off, then vanishes]'' All I wanted was to be able to smell like the rest of you. ''[runs away crying, then cuts to a cemetery]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|''[reading tombstone]'' Here lies the nose of Patrick Star. Rip. ''[referring to the R.I.P]'' Well, this is terrible! All Patrick wanted was to be like the rest of us, and we punished him for it.}}
{{L|Squidward|Who cares? At least now that pink moron will leave us alone.}}
{{L|Patrick|I heard that! ''[moves to Patrick with giant human ears]''}}
