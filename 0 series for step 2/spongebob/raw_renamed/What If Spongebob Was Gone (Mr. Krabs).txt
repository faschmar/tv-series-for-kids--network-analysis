{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ah, who needs him? I can manage this place and do SpongeBob's job with me eyes closed ''[flips a burger and puts it on a Krabby Patty]'' and me pockets full. ''[brings the Krabby Patty to Frankie]'' Here you are, sir. ''[slips on some soda on the floor]'' Whoa! ''[the Krabby Patty lands on Frankie's face]'' Sorry about that. ''[smells smoke and notices that it's from the grill]'' Oopsy. ''[blows off smoke from Patties]'' Phew. ''[but the hat lands on the grill and causes a fire to start; Mr. Krabs screams]'' Fire! Fire! Fire! ''[Squidward and Frankie scream while running out of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs has his head unstuck with the window and breaks the table, landing on the floor]'' Okay, maybe I do need SpongeBob.}}
