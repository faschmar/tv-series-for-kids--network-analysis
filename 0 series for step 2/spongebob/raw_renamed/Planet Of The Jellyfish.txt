{{L|''[SpongeBob catches three jellyfish in his net]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Weee! Gotchya! There you go, little fella. ''[to Patrick]'' Say, Patrick. Don't you think that Jellyfish Fields has gotten bigger today?}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know, but all of this failure is tiring me out. I'm just gonna take a nap on that rock right over there.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, Patrick. I'll go see if there are any jellyfish in that creepy, scary, evil-looking cave over there.}}
{{L|''[Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord is shown]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Catches a jellyfish while the overlord watches from the "evil looking cave" ]'' Aw. You're the charms. If only you didn't sting, you'd make the perfect pet! ''[SpongeBob touches the Jellien and the Jellyfish stings SpongeBob]'' Oh, well! I guess it's catch and release for now.}}
{{L|''[Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord catches a jellyfish with its tongue, makes a tentacle and it turns it into a Jellien; right after that, the Overlord makes 3 more tentacles to release more Jelliens. Patrick is shown sleeping. One of the Jelliens engulfs Patrick's entire body and creates a Jellienized clone of Patrick. Some Jelliens take the real Patrick away. Tentacles extend out of Jellien Patrick's mouth and place Patrick's jellyfish net in Jellien Patrick into his hand]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[steps in front of Patrick]'' Isn't he the cutest little jellyfish you've ever seen. ''[picks up Jellien jellyfish by the stingers]'' And he doesn't sting.}}
{{L|''[Jellien Patrick raises his net and captures numerous jellyfish in his net]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looking at Jellien jellyfish]'' You don't suppose this is some sort of new breed, huh? ''[places Jellien jellyfish back into net]'' I think I'll keep this one as a pet. ''[spots Jellien Patrick's overfilled net]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|Jellien Patrick|Yes. I too have caught many jellyfish. ''[holding up index finger]'' Perhaps we shall give one to each of our friends. ''[grins and breaths heavily]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, Patrick! That's a great idea.}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to Squidward's house at night]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, we've given a jellyfish to everyone, except Squidward. I'm sure he doesn't want one.}}
{{L|Jellien Patrick|He will take one and like it. ''[Patrick tries shoving the Jellien into the mail slot but it doesn't fit, so Pat uses the net the cram the Jellien into the mail slot and it goes through, The Jellien then heads upstairs and a tentacle pops out the right window, and goo spills out of it and unto the ground, to which the goo forms Jellien Squidward]'' Pleasant dreams, square one.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hah, back at ya good buddy. ''[Jellien Squidward is behind him]''}}
{{L|Jellien Squidward|Don't let the bed bugs bite. Ha ha ha.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um, that's some good advice. Good night, Squidward.}}
{{L|Jellien Squidward|''[twists their head around 180°]''  There will be plenty of biting this night. BRAAAP!}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[To Jellien]'' Tonight, you'll sleep with me little jelly. Goodnight, jellyfish. Goodnight, Gary! Heh, good night little jelly. ''[SpongeBob sleeps. The Jellien tries to climb on SpongeBob, but he wakes up]'' Ah, I can't sleep. ''[walks downstairs. The Jellien follows him. SpongeBob is watching a horror film and eating popcorn. The Jellien tries to climb on SpongeBob again, but he screams he laughs nervously]”'' These late-night horror shows are a real hoot. ''“[The Jellien tries to climb on him, once again]'' Oh, hey you want some popcorn? Here ya go. ''[tosses popcorn into the Jellien's mouth, causing it to choke]'' Hey, hey! Are you okay back there?}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to morning. The Jellien is shown sleeping]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aw, look at him, the little angel. Guess he couldn't make it past the third feature. ''[picks up the Jellien]'' Good morning sleepy-head. We wouldn't want anything to happen to you while I'm at work. ''[puts the Jellien in a cage]'' You better stay in here where it's safe. ''[pats Gary's shell]'' You two stay out of trouble, bye!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob leaves his house and Gary takes a nap near a plant. The Jellien then eats Gary and the plant at the same time creating Jellien Gary, which looks like Gary mixed with a plant. Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking into the Krusty Krab]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa! Look at all of the customers!}}
{{L|Jellien Clone|One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise.}}
{{L|Jellien Squidward|One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise.}}
{{L|Jellien Patrick|''[holds out a tray with a Krabby Patty]'' One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise.}}
{{L|Jellien Squidward|''[takes the tray with the Krabby Patty and gives it to the Jellien Clone]'' Thank you, come again.}}
{{L|Jellien Clone and Jellien Squidward|Braaap!}}
{{L|''[The next customer, who appears normal walks up]''}}
{{L|Martin|I would like one Krabby Pat-}}
{{L|Jellien Squidward|''[takes out another Krabby Patty]'' One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise. BRAAAP!}}
{{L|Martin|Ugh. Actually I want one with extra mayo!}}
{{L|''[Jellien Squidward and the rest of the Jellien Clones begin hissing and pointing at the lone, normal fish]''}}
{{L|Martin|W-what's wrong, dudes?}}
{{L|Jellien Mr. Krabs|''[comes out of Mr. Krabs' office]'' I'm sorry, valued customer. We are currently out of the condiment you call mayonnaise. ''[takes out a Jellien]'' Please accept this free jellyfish hat instead! ''[puts the Jellien on the normal fish's head]'' Thank you, come again! ''[leaves]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks confused]'' Huh? That's funny. We just received a whole shipment of mayonnaise. ''[walks to the back and spots Jellien Patrick]'' Patrick?!? What are you doing? Cooking Krabby Patties is my job.}}
{{L|Jellien Patrick|I am here to replace you and all of your kind!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' I saw that movie last night, too. Whoops! If you're going work here, you're going to need an official Krusty Krab hat.}}
{{L|Jellien Patrick|Hat? ''[grows a Krusty Krab hat on his head]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Say, that's a pretty neat trick! I'm going to get some extra mayonnaise from the back.}}
{{L|Jellien Patrick|''[quickly turns around with his torso still facing the grill]'' No mayonnaise! ''[uses his mouth tentacles to eat the Krabby Patty SpongeBob was holding then turns back around to cook more Patties]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|O...kay? ''[walks into the freezer]'' He's acting weird today. ''[spots the boxes of mayonnaise]'' Hey! There's plenty of mayo back here! ''[hears a strange noise]'' Huh? Is somebody in there? ''[looks into the back and spots the Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord, Jelliens, and all of the citizens trapped in pods]'' Monsters! Huh? Squidward and Mr. Krabs! Patrick, too! ''[spots Harold]'' And some random guy! Huh? ''[screams, noticing his spatula is also trapped in a pod]'' My spatula! It's just like that movie I watched last night! Those things have captured everyone and put them into creepy pods. ''[walks out of the freezer, nervously walking past Jellien Patrick]'' Hi, uh, Patrick? I gotta...clean the tables...Patrick. Ha ha...Patrick. ''[walks out backwards with Jellien Squidward then surprising him]''}}
{{L|Jellien Squidward|Hi, SpongeBob! Don't you want this cute little jellyfish? ''[the Jellien then hisses at SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ha ha... uh, no thanks. ''[continues walking backwards and bumps into Jellien Mr. Krabs]'' Ah! Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Jellien Mr. Krabs|You seem tired, SpongeBob. Why don't you go home and take a nap? ''[hisses strangely at SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Jellien Squidward|''[still holding a Jellien]'' Yes, and you can use this jelly as a pillow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, that's okay. I-I have one at home. Hah... ''[continues walking backwards until he is scared off by more Jellien Clones until he reaches the door]''}}
{{L|Jellien Squidward and Jellien Mr. Krabs|Sleep well.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[continues walking backwards until he bumps into Jellien Harold]''}}
{{L|Jellien Harold|Sleep!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah! Random guy! ''[starts running from a bunch of Jelliens, until he loses them by hiding behind a rock]'' What am I going to do? All of my friends taken by those Jelly creatures. I can feel their creepy, rope-like tentacles now! ''[suddenly is roped and dragged into Sandy's treedome and is locked down]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Alright, you rotten jelly clone! What have you done with SpongeBob?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm no clone, Sandy! I am SpongeBob!}}
{{L|Sandy|Then you won't mind if I run a simple test. ''[she cracks her knuckles and she starts tickling him]''}}
{{L|Sandy| Cootchie Cootchie coo! Cootchie Cootchie Cootchie Coo!''}}
{{L|SpongeBob| No! no! not the cootchie cootchie coo! ''[laughs]'' No that's the tickle spot! ''[continues laughing]''}}
{{L|Sandy|You're SpongeBob, alright...}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to where SpongeBob is free]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What are we going to do, Sandy?}}
{{L|Sandy|If only we knew the Jellien's weakness.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, the only thing I know is that they can't stand mayonnaise.}}
{{L|Sandy|Ew, I don't like mayonnaise neither.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks suspiciously at Sandy]'' Oh, so you don't like mayo? Just like a Jellien!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[smacks SpongeBob]'' Oh, snap out of it, SpongeBob! Now if only we had some mayonnaise.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|There's lot at the Krusty Krab! But we'll never get past them! ''[points to a bunch of Jellien Clones just outside the dome]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Not to worry! ''[takes out glasses that looks like the Jellien's eyes]'' We'll be in disguise.}}
{{L|''[They both walk outside the dome whistling as they walk up to a Jellien Clone]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Greetings, fellow clone. I hate mayonnaise.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I hate mayonnaise and mustard.}}
{{L|Jellien Fred|''[looks suspiciously at SpongeBob]'' Hmm...}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Sandy both walk off whistling]''}}
{{L|Jellien Fred|I like mustard!}}
{{L|''[They both walk into the Krusty Krab and meet up with Jellien Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Jellien Mr. Krabs|Did you take that nap, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh huh! Sure did!}}
{{L|Sandy|Yep. We're all rested and jelly-fied.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs nervously and elbows Sandy accidentally knocking off her Jellien glasses]'' Good one, Jellien Sandy.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[laughs nervously]''}}
{{L|Jellien Mr. Krabs|Imposters!}}
{{L|''[All of the Jellien Clones in the Krusty Krab begin hissing and surrounding SpongeBob and Sandy]''}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob! The mayonnaise!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[leaps up high and swings over to the condiment stand and grabs a jug of mayonnaise, then squirts one at Jellien Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Jellien Mr. Krabs|Ah! ''[the mayonnaise lands on him]'' Ew... ''[he then disintegrates which frees the real Mr. Krabs from his pod]''}}
{{L|Sandy|It worked, SpongeBob! Keep going!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[squirts Jellien Squidward who tried to attack him with mayonnaise destroying him and freeing Squidward in the process]''.}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob! Look out!}}
{{L|''[All of the Jellien Clones begin to close in to which SpongeBob squirts and destroys all of them. SpongeBob and Sandy then head towards the back running past Jellien Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, hi, Jellien Patrick!}}
{{L|Jellien Patrick|Hold the mayonnaise!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|D'oh! Almost forgot! ''[squirts Jellien Patrick with the mayonnaise, causing him to disintegrate and frees Patrick from his pod]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[wakes up and falls on his neck]'' D'oh! Hey guys! What's shaking? ''[Squidward nervously points to the Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord and Patrick realizes the situation]'' Oh...}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Sandy enter the freezer to confront the Overlord]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Hold it right there, you evil blob of slime! You're through 'cause we know your weakness! Show 'em, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob shows the Overlord the jug of mayonnaise. The Overlord then roars loudly telling the Jelliens to attack SpongeBob and Sandy]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Let 'er rip!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[starts squirting the Jelliens until the jug of mayonnaise starts to act up]'' Nah! Gasp! Sandy! It's so cold in here the mayonnaise is starting to freeze!}}
{{L|Sandy|Then hurry and throw it, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye, aye! ''[unscrews the lid of the jug of mayonnaise and hurls it at the Overlord, but it freezes and lands on its head. Then it laughs at SpongeBob's failure]'' Oh no! This mayonnaise is frozen solid!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[next to a thermostat]'' Then I'll just turn up the heat! ''[turns the thermostat from "COLD" to "HOT", causing the mayonnaise to melt on the Overlord's head, thus destroying him and all of the Jelliens]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Sandy|Hooray!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What happened?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, let me tell ya!}}
{{L|Frenchy|Eleven minutes later...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And that's why we're covered in goo!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Thanks for rescuing us, SpongeBob. But what are we going to do with all of this green slop?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[tastes the green goo]'' Mmm! Freaky Clone Jelly Relish!}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab again]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Relish Patties! Get your Freaky Clone Jelly Relish Patties! Only four bucks extra!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[to Squidward]'' Uh, I'll have one Relish Patty. Hold the mayo.}}
{{L|''[Both Squidward and SpongeBob open their eyes wide. SpongeBob looks suspiciously at Patrick with the next time card saying "The End?", ending the episode]''}}
