{{L|''[SpongeBob Patrick are browsing through Fry Cook Museum making noises at every rare item they see]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula! ''[Larry tries to pull the spatula out]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, SpongeBob, look what it says here. ''[reads plaque]'' Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease, but all have failed.}}
{{L|Larry|''[Makes a straining noise after the golden spatula springs back.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|...the golden spatula. Wow!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula! ''[SpongeBob runs up to the spatula and holds it]'' Okay, I'm ready! ''[Patrick is about to take a picture]''}}
{{L|Miss Shell|Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is? ''[Patrick gets confused and drools]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way. ''[SpongeBob pulls the spatula out and gray clouds appear above him]'' Uh-oh.}}
{{L|Miss Shell|''[deep voice]'' Holy smokes! ''[runs away]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Rude. Hey, the light changed.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uhh, Patrick...}}
{{L|Patrick|''[lightning bolts strike]'' Hold on, almost there. ''[clouds open to a mysterious figure comes out that is known as]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.}}
{{L|King Neptune|A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge. ''[SpongeBob goes droopy each time he is insulted]'' Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore, you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny! ''[laughs]'' Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook. ''[searches for the real spatula taker]'' No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no... ''[soon comes up to a hot dog stand]'' Ah!}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|But, but...}}
{{L|King Neptune|A purveyor of foods. ''[chuckles]'' Yes, you must be my new fry cook.}}
{{L|Hot Dog Vendor|Uhh, sorry, King Neptune. I don't make them. I just sell them.}}
{{L|King Neptune|Then who pulled out the spatula?}}
{{L|Hot Dog Vendor|''[scoffs at Neptune]'' Uh, he did. ''[points to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[everyone laughs]'' It is even funnier a second time! ''[destroys the hot dog stand with his fist]'' You there, crustacean!}}
{{L|Larry|Who, me?}}
{{L|King Neptune|You have the physique of Atlas!}}
{{L|Larry|''[laughs]'' Thanks, I work out.}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[laughs]'' Make poses with me!}}
{{L|Larry|Okay!}}
{{L|Larry and King Neptune|''[show off their muscles]'' Body slam! ''[body slams each other]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|You pulled the spatula from the grease!}}
{{L|Larry|Nope, that was SpongeBob.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob smiles]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook? ''[everyone runs except Patrick]'' Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know who can flip a burger to suit a royal palate! ''[Patrick points to SpongeBob]'' What? Am I expected to believe ''this'' creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof? ''[Patrick shows the photo he took of SpongeBob holding the spatula]'' Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Like?}}
{{L|King Neptune|The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Actually, I've got two. ''[shows two left hands]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[snaps fingers]'' Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear. ''[SpongeBob shows his red underwear]'' No, blue. ''[SpongeBob shows his blue underwear]'' Uh, the royal fry cook's wallet contains... ''[SpongeBob takes out his wallet]'' His big toes are... ''[SpongeBob gets ready to show something about his foot]'' Uhh, he has six...}}
{{L|Patrick|''[contemptuously mocks Neptune]'' He is the new royal fry cook and you...}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[shouting]'' Silence! ''[Patrick gets zapped]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Is it hot in here or what? ''[falls over]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasp]'' Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[grabs SpongeBob]'' So, little one, you think you have what it takes to be my fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[faint, down below]'' ''[mocks Neptune again]'' Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any!'' [Patrick gets zapped again]'' Ouch.}}
{{L|King Neptune|Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.}}
{{L|Patrick| ''[mocks Neptune again]'' Only two? One or two challenges to someone like Sponge?'' [Patrick gets zapped again]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|Three challenges!}}
{{L|Patrick|Three? ''[laughs contemptuously]'' ''[mocks Neptune with sarcasm]'' Three challenges are nothing. It might as well be! 500 challenges! ''[Patrick gets zapped again]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|Enough! ''[Patrick gets zapped into a dust pile]''}}
{{L|Patrick|He'll settle for one.}}
{{L|King Neptune|There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.}}
{{L|King Neptune|Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him. ''[Patrick gets zapped to normal]''}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! ''[turns around as we see that his face is now on the bottom of his body above his legs]'' SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How you feeling?}}
{{L|Patrick|Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?}}
{{L|King Neptune|And now, see the fate that may lie ahead. ''[summons the clouds]'' For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great. ''[opens the clouds]'' Behold! ''[shows Tom Kenny taking a shower and he screams; Neptune quickly closes the portal and chuckles sheepishly]'' Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold! ''[opens the clouds again and shows the city of Atlantis]'' My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, that sounds pretty good.}}
{{L|King Neptune|But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm ready.}}
{{L|King Neptune|Very well then. To the Poseidome! ''[At the Poseidome]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off! ''[Everyone cheers]'' All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.''[King Neptune and SpongeBob shake hands. SpongeBob's arm disintegrates]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[regrows his hand]'' May the best man win.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking! ''[talking to SpongeBob]'' Don't worry, lad, I have total confidence in you. ''[Mr. Krabs has a lot of money in his hands]'' Put it all on Neptune!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.}}
{{L|Patrick|Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: "Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds." Well, just look at me now. ''[bell dings]'' Go get 'em, tiger! ''[King Neptune starts making his Krabby Patties and so does SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|''[King Neptune makes his very quickly with help from sea creatures and his magic. SpongeBob takes his time going through each important step to make sure his patty comes out right. King Neptune summons large amounts of wheat from the ground and zaps them into buns.]''}}
{{L|''[King Neptune summons the vegetables, and summons the swordfish to slice them all. SpongeBob makes sure a tomato is perfectly aligned. He carefully slices the tomato with the golden spatula.]''}}
{{L|''[King Neptune zaps the patties, while SpongeBob rubs sticks to create a fire. King Neptune uses magic to flip hundreds of patties. SpongeBob patiently waits for the patty to cook above the campfire.]''}}
{{L|''[King Neptune uses magic to assemble the hundreds of burgers that appear like Krabby Patties. King Neptune laughs while the burgers rain down. SpongeBob puts ketchup on two pickles to apply faces on them. He applies a cheese "blanket," kisses a pickle.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[reading a bedtime story to the pickles]'' Once upon a time...}}
{{L|''[King Neptune still laughs, while the burgers assemble in a square-based pyramid. SpongeBob puts the top bun on his one Krabby Patty.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Perfect!}}
{{L|''[In the end, the score is King Neptune: 1000 and SpongeBob: 1]''}}
{{L|King Neptune|I win! ''[everyone cheers but SpongeBob]'' Loser! ''[Chuckles]'' Free patties for everyone! ''[everyone chews a bite out of the patties that King Neptune made and they spit it out immediately]'' Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious! ''[sniffs one]'' Ooh.}}
{{L|Audience|''[Everyone complains different complaints that King Neptune needs to try one of his burgers]'' You can eat it all, come one! Chew it! Why don't you eat it? Try it! Eat it! Eat it!}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[throws his burger out]'' Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better? ''[King Neptune grabs a patty from SpongeBob]'' Give me that! ''[King Neptune eats it and begins to like it]'' Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time! ''[King Neptune spits it out and eats it again; the crowd groans in disgust.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So, uhh, what do you think?}}
{{L|King Neptune|Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win. ''[everyone cheers]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Yeah! ''[both dancing]'' We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis! ''[King Neptune laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's so funny?}}
{{L|King Neptune|You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You mean, Patrick can't come?}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[laughs]'' No, of course not.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And my friends?}}
{{L|King Neptune|Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[crying and wiping his tears with a tissue]'' It was nice knowing you, buddy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Mr. Krabs cries]'' I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I lost me bet!}}
{{L|King Neptune|Come, SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart... ''[a two-seater bike appears]'' to Atlantis!''[rings bell]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I... I... ''[cries]'' I don't wanna go!}}
{{L|King Neptune|It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it! ''[King Neptune zaps SpongeBob and he becomes a muscular god. But being the same size, he looks a little strange]'' Maybe we do have a problem.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in a booming voice]'' Wait, Neptune! I have another idea! ''[Patrick walks in the Krusty Krab still looking the same when King Neptune changed him back to normal but with his face on the bottom]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Good morning, Krusty Krew.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, Patrick. What'll you have? ''[Patrick drools stupidly then SpongeBob hears King Neptune shout]'' Can you excuse me?}}
{{L|King Neptune|The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thine own wrath, stove! ''[uses his powers to zap the stove]'' Haha!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in a stern voice]'' What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?}}
{{L|King Neptune|''[Sighs. Embarrassedly puts arms behind his back.]'' Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic. ''[SpongeBob smiles]''}}
