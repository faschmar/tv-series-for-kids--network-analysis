{{L|''[episode starts at the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is grumbling]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What is going on here?! ''[screams, and rips off some of his skin, then Karen comes out]''}}
{{L|Karen|What's wrong now?}}
{{L|Plankton|Same as always, look, empty again!}}
{{L|Karen|So what are you gonna do about it?}}
{{L|Plankton|I don't know anymore! ''[cries]''}}
{{L|Karen|Hey, hey, hey, why don't you just work on a new recipe?}}
{{L|Plankton|What's the point? I haven't had a customer in years! ''[Nat walks in]''}}
{{L|Nat|Hello!}}
{{L|Plankton|Away with you! Can't you see that I'm self-loathing here?}}
{{L|Nat|Sorry, I just wanted a Chum Stick.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[eye pops out in shock]'' What?!}}
{{L|Nat|Yes, I'd like one of your Chum Sticks.}}
{{L|Plankton|You're kidding, right?}}
{{L|Nat|No, I'm serious, I want a Chum Stick.}}
{{L|Plankton|Uh, okay if you insist. ''[hands him a Chum Stick, and Nat eats it]'' Oh, no, please don't sue me! ''[Nat finishes the whole thing and says: Mmm-mmm!]'' I can't believe someone actually enjoys my chum! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Nat|Now this was so good, I'm going to have to come back tomorrow. ''[hands him a dollar]'' Here you go. See you in the morning.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[to Karen]'' Did you see that? I didn't even have to threaten his life! He loved it!}}
{{L|Karen|How'd you pull that off?}}
{{L|Plankton|Well it's simple, finally someone came in who has good taste. And he's coming back tomorrow! Excuse me, Karen, but I've gotta whip up some more. ''[cuts to the next day, Plankton comes running out of the Kitchen with a Chum Stick]'' Now, I wait. I wait until he returns. ''[hops up on a stool, and stares out the window]'' I wait. I wait. I wait. I wait.}}
{{L|French Narrator|8 hours later... ''[Plankton is asleep, then the clock wakes him up]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Huh? Nat? Hello? Huh? What? ''[sees the clock]'' Uh, it's closing time. I should have known it was too good to be true.}}
{{L|Nat|Hey!}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, hello, Nat!}}
{{L|Nat|I came back like I said yesterday.}}
{{L|Plankton|You certainly did, didn't you?}}
{{L|Nat|I'd like another Chum Stick, please.}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, it's your lucky day, Nat. I happen to have a quite delectable one, right here.}}
{{L|Nat|Oh, boy! ''[eats it]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Is it okay?}}
{{L|Nat|''[angry]'' Okay?! ''[happy]'' It's perfection! ''[both laugh, and then do a high five]'' Hey, how about I have another?}}
{{L|Plankton|You betcha! ''[gives Nat another one, and he eats it]''}}
{{L|Nat|Whoo, boy! I cannot believe how good these things are.}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, well, you know.}}
{{L|Nat|All right, see you tomorrow. ''[hands him another dollar]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What?! You're coming back again?}}
{{L|Nat|Oh, you know it! And the day after that, and the next week after that! You've got a regular customer on your hands! ''[walks out]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, my, this is amazing! At last, I've got my revenge! ''[laughs evilly, then cuts to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is laughing]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|♪Rolling, rolling, rolling! Money keeps on rolling along!♪ ''[playing bowling with money]'' One more time! ''[notices Plankton]'' No way, Plankton! You're not getting me formula this time or any time! ''[throws him on the counter, then gets a spoon, and crushes him]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Don't bother. There's no need.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What are you talking about?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[slides out of the spoon]'' I'm just saying I no longer need to copy you, Krabs. I've got my own winning recipe now.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' You're really funny, man! You think you can compete with me? Look, Plankton, look at all these loyal customers. Loyal to me, Plankton, not to you!}}
{{L|Nat|Hey, Plankton, can I get another one of your delicious Chum Sticks?}}
{{L|Plankton|But of course, loyal customer. ''[hops out of Mr. Krabs' hands, onto Nat's hand]'' I'll see you later, loser. Much later! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, no! How can this be? Boy, front and center!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, sir!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Plankton's trying to overthrow me business! He's got a customer that actually likes his food! You've gotta get that guy back on our side with a couple of Krabby Patties.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, you can count on me, sir. ''[cuts to Nat walking toward the Chum Bucket]'' Pardon me, you smart fellow. Down here. ''[laying on the floor, like a mat]'' Why settle for Plankton's lumpy chum, when you can enjoy a steaming Krabby Patty for free?}}
{{L|Nat|''[sniffs it, shakes in disgust]'' No thanks. ''[opens the door, peeling off SpongeBob's skin]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Barnacles! ''[cuts to SpongeBob in a chair]'' There he is. Just in time for breakfast. ''[walks down the street, then throws a rock on the ground]'' Oh, I am such a clumsy oaf. I sure hope nothing happens to this Krabby Patty while I step carefully over this rock here. ''[deliberately trips over the rock]'' Oh, no! Too late! No! No! ''[tries to shove in his mouth, but his mouth dodges every time]'' Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Come on, Nat. Just one accidental bite! I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty is gonna make a great snack later.}}
{{L|Nat|Yeah, do me a favor. ''[rips off SpongeBob's pants, uses it as a napkin, then gives it back]'' From now on, keep those Shabby Patties to yourself. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, fishpaste! ''[cuts to the Chum Bucket]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Nat, back all ready? That's the fifth time today. Not that I'm surprised. Karen, babe, fetch Nat another plate of that sweet chum.}}
{{L|Karen|Yes, Your Diminutiveness. ''[goes in the kitchen]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Say, Nat, do you have any friends?}}
{{L|Nat|Nope. ''[Plankton sings a little, then laughs]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Would you hurry up with that chum, Karen?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Karen]'' Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep your tiny pants on Plankton, bleep bloop. ''[throws a Krabby Patty]'' There's your chum, bleep blap blop.}}
{{L|Nat|Hey, this doesn't look like chum.}}
{{L|Plankton|And that doesn't look like Karen! ''[SpongeBob looks like Karen]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why, don't be ridiculous, my husband, bleep blap. Of course it's me.}}
{{L|Plankton|What have you done with Karen, you brute?! ''[cut to the kitchen, where Karen is taped up]''}}
{{L|Nat|How many times do I have to tell you? ''[throws the Krabby Patty away]'' I don't want to eat your trash! Plankton's chum is my favorite breakfast, lunch, and dinner! I love chum! So forget it! I don't want to eat anything else! ''[SpongeBob returns to normal, and speaks in normal voice]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So you're saying that you love chum? And all that you ever eat is chum?}}
{{L|Nat|Yeah! Th-that's right!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Interesting. ''[walks away, scene then cuts to Nat walking out of a trailer. He notices a hole with a sign that says "Shortcut 2 Chum Bucket"]''}}
{{L|Nat|A shortcut to the Chum Bucket? Hmm. That must be for me. ''[whistles as he goes through the hole, and it leads to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs|Welcome, valued customer!}}
{{L|Nat|This isn't the Chum Bucket.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' Why go to the Chum Bucket when the Krusty Krab has added tasty chum to our menu?}}
{{L|Nat|That's okay, I only eat Chum Bucket brand chum.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But we've developed a special recipe for the most discerning chum lovers. Besides, I locked all the exits until you give it a try. So what do you say? ''[Nat eats it, then spits it out]'' You like it?}}
{{L|Nat|It's...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah?}}
{{L|Nat|It's... ''[coughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, what do you think?}}
{{L|Nat|It's the second foulest thing I've ever tasted! ''[vomits in a sick and angry mood off screen]'' I'm going back to Plankton's chum. ''[crawls away]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What am I going to do?! I can't let Plankton have so much as one single customer! ''[cries]'' I just can't afford it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I guess you'll have to make Chum that's as good as Plankton's.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But to do that, I need to know how Plankton makes his Chum. ''[gets an idea]'' That's it boyo! ''[cuts to the Chum Bucket at night time. Mr. Krabs sneaks over and uses a flamethrower to cut his way through the Chum Bucket metal wall, allowing him to get inside]'' Where could it be? ''[notices the safe]'' There! Plankton's secret formula! ''[tries to open it]'' It's gotta be in here... ''[an alarm goes off, and he gets crushed by a giant spoon]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[laughs]'' What do you think Krabs, baby? This time I caught you trying to steal ''my'' secret formula! Ironic, isn't it?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing. You see, crabs are not born with an innate inkling of irony.}}
{{L|Plankton|Ouch, double irony! ''[SpongeBob picks him up]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Triple irony, Plankton! Though you nabbed Krabs trying to steal your formula, I'm still here to foil your evil plans! So, it's like a dollop of irony on top of an ironic twist. ''[Plankton groans]'' I mean, just think about that. ''[presses a button on his remote]'' You know, in a weird way, it's like we never left the... ''[gets crushed by a giant spoon]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Good thing I sprang for the dual spoon installation.}}
{{L|Karen|Call it a computer's intuition, but I sense your regular approaching, with an unusually large wad of cash.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Look at all that loot!}}
{{L|Plankton|That's right, Krabs! And you're going to have to keep looking when my customer comes in and pays me for my chum!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|D'oh, just put me out of me misery! ''[Nat walks in, angered]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Back for more of my delicious chum, I see!}}
{{L|Nat|Not this time.}}
{{L|Plankton and Mr. Krabs|Huh?}}
{{L|Nat|''[to Karen]'' Not ever again! ''[throws all the money at Karen's computer screen]'' The deal's off, computer! I can't eat another bite of that slop, no matter how much you pay me!}}
{{L|Plankton|Ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-huh?}}
{{L|Nat|I have eaten ten of those things, and I've already had to go to the doctor...twice! ''[groans in pain and stumbles backward, falling to the ground, then Joe and his co-worker put him on a medical bed.]'' If you need me, I'll be getting my stomach pumped. Again. ''[They carry him out.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What's the deal, Karen?}}
{{L|Karen|The deal was that I paid Nat to eat your chum, so you'd quit your constant complaining.}}
{{L|Plankton|All this time, I never had one regular customer?}}
{{L|Karen|Duh.}}
{{L|Plankton|Should have known! Why would anyone ever eat my slop?}}
{{L|Karen|Uhh, there he goes again. Cut it out, Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|What? It's just obvious that I'm a complete failure, and a waste of a lower life form! Oh, woe is me! ''[cries]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Quickly, now is the time to beat a hasty retreat!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What? And miss this? I've never enjoyed meself more! This irony's pretty good stuff! ''[laughs]''}}
