{{L|SpongeBob|''[comes out from behind a rock]'' Oh, hello. Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Jellyfish Trauma Center. Let's go inside. ''[smashes into the door]'' Ow!}}
{{L|Patient|Ow! Ow! Ow! It burns.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[walks past patients with various injuries]'' These poor souls are here because they found themselves for the wrong side of a jellyfish stinger. Not if they're the right side. ''[laughs]'' The point is, that we will all be respectful...}}
{{L|Plankton|Ouch!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Bah! Stepped on a pickle.}}
{{L|Plankton|Pickle?! I'm not a pickle, you... ''[SpongeBob picks up Plankton]'' Whoa! Careful, oaf!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ow, that pickle's Plankton. What happened to you?}}
{{L|Plankton|This is the Jellyfish Trauma Center, dunce. What do you think hapâ€”}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aw, you poor thing, have some flowers.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[screams]'' I'm allergic to Chrysanthemums! ''[turns red]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nurse! This hot dog needs help!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[comes in dressed like a nurse]'' I'm on it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, what are you doing here?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[starts filling Plankton with air]'' Community service. It's a long story.}}
{{L|Plankton|Um, I could use a little help here. ''[opens door and floats away into the air]'' Well, at least I'm safe from those savages. ''[shows one jellyfish]'' Err, gah. Ohhh! ''[shows all the jellyfishes]'' Oh, mommy. Not the eye! ''[the jellyfish sting him and he screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I think we've all learned something here for today. Thanks for watching.}}
