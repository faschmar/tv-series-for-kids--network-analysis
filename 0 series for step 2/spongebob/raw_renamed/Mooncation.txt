{{L|Patrick|''[walking]'' So why are we going to Sandy's house?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|To see her vacation slides for the hu.. ''[gets smacked in face by door]'' Ow!}}
{{L|ZDS Agent|''[Walking out the door with his partner and the slides]'' We got the slides, sir.}}
{{L|Patrick|Who?...What?...Why?}}
{{L|''[The both get dragged in by Sandy]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[Taking SpongeBob and Patrick]'' Those two agents from the Zero Dryland Security just confiscated all my vacation slides, boys. Or so they think... ''[She pulls a tree trunk lever to activate a secret hideout]'' You see, ''[puts the two on two chairs. She goes to a copy of the vacation slides]'' Someone already made six copies.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob raises his hand]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Yes, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Who is this someone? Do we know him?}}
{{L|Sandy|By someone, I was implying me, SpongeBob. ''[Patrick raises his hand]'' Yes, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Can you not imply anymore? It's confusing.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob raises his hand again]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[tying up SpongeBob and Patrick with rope]'' Okay, no more questions until the end of the slideshow. Okay? ''[they nod in agreement]'' Good. ''[shows the first slide]'' The first slide is of me getting some last-minute readings before I took off on my vacation. ''[switches to the next slide]'' And this is me giving the thumbs-up-goodbye for now salute. ''[shows the next slide]'' And this... ''[dreadfully] This'' is where a little square pal of mine decided to pay me a visit.}} 
{{L|''[transition to SpongeBob visiting Sandy]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[walking to Sandy's house]'' ♪I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy ''[spinning]'' I'm ready to ring Sandy's doorbell♪ ''[rings the doorbell; suddenly, an extreme humming noise vibrates the ocean floor]'' Sandy...! ''[a rocket emerges from beneath the ground]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|Sandy|What do you think of my moon wagon?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I activated it! How was I to know it was hooked up to your doorbell?}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh no, SpongeBob. That's what you call a "coincidence." I'm getting ready for my vacation!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Where are you going?}}
{{L|Sandy|The moon! ''[SpongeBob gasps]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're going on a moon trip?!}}
{{L|Sandy|Yep! I'm all packed up and ready to go. Wanna help me…}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll be right back!}}
{{L|Sandy|...load up the moon wagon? ''[sighs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[SpongeBob is at bakery]'' Morning, Mr. Bakerman! Oh, that's right, I'm sorry. I have to pick a number. ''[attempts to pull a ticket, but fails and gets tangled up]''}}
{{L|Bakerman|Number 12.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, I'm Number 12!}}
{{L|Bakerman|What can I get for you today?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I need a bon voyage sheet cake. ''[Bakerman brings out out sheet cake]'' Could you put yummy words on it? Hmmmmm, what would those yummy words be? I got it! "Have fun on the moon...". What rhymes with "moon"? Tune? Roon? Noon? Goon?}}
{{L|Bakerman|How about “loon?”}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I got it! "See you soon!”}}
{{L|Countdown|''[SpongeBob heads back to Sandy’s dome with the cake. The rocket is a few seconds from takeoff]'' T-minus 12, 11, 10, 9, 8…}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Sandy! Wait! You can't go without your sheet cake! ''[grabs a hold of the ladder, but falls into the rocket]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[sees SpongeBob]'' SpongeBob? What in cold chicken and pickles are you doing in my ship?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[panting, and out of breath]'' I went to get you a, so I went to the, and then I got you a, and then T-minus something, and…}}
{{L|Countdown|Launch commencing.}}
{{L|Sandy|Never mind. Can't stop the countdown now. Better strap yourself down. Looks like you're going on a mooncation!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I am?! Whoooooo! Moon trip! Moon trip! Moon trip! ''[rocket takes off]'' Hey, Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Hey, Sandy...}}
{{L|Sandy|Uh, I'm kinda busy here, SpongeBob. Gotta recalculate to account for the extra weight.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I just wanted to show you the…}}
{{L|Sandy|for the afterburners! ''[activates afterburners; propels rocket further]'' What were you saying, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I… brought you a “bon voyage” sheet cake.}}
{{L|Sandy|You can't bring regular food into space!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wha, wha, wha, why not?}}
{{L|Sandy|Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh. Is that a bad thing?}}
{{L|Sandy|Only if it gets sucked into the reverse spatial linearity drive. ''[cake floats into the reverse spatial linearity drive. The rocket engine malfunctions and turns off]'' Ah nuts!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oops. Sorry, Sandy.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[presses "Toss" button, and gets dressed in a large space suit]'' Well, it's a good thing I've brought my special space suit designed for just this kind of situation! Now, try not to file anything else up while I'm saving our necks. ''[goes into space]'' Aha! There's our problem. ''[clears the cake out from the the reverse spatial linearity drive.]'' Eh, could've used more nuts. ''[comes back inside rocket]'' Okay. I've got her up and running, again. Now, can you please sit with your hands folded for a while, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Roger that! Folding hands.}}
{{L|Sandy|Now, get ready for lunar module se…}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[folds hands into a bird]'' What do you think Sandy?}}
{{L|Sandy|Just don't touch anything while we separate.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ok.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[detaches rocket from boosters]'' That looks like a good spot. ''[lands on the moon, sets camp up]'' Alright, SpongeBob. Now that our camp is set up, it's time for some moon crater boarding! ''[brings out boards]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's moon crater boarding?}}
{{L|Sandy|You ride these on that like this. ''[jumps on and rides her snowboard on the moon]'' Yeehaw! Right here is the Flip-a-dee-do-dah. ''[flips her board in midair]'' Right there is the classic Texas tail grab. ''[grabs tail, and twists it into the shape of Texas]'' And this I call the 7-20 Nut Drop. ''[spins and breaks an asteroid into an acorn and eats it]'' Munchie! And let's not forget my grandpappy's favorite: The Tour de Saturn. ''[lies down on Saturn's rings]'' Star gazer! Yeehaw! Nothing like extreme sports and zero gravity! Alright your turn.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh gee Sandy. I don't know. This looks kinda scary.}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh, come on SpongeBob. You got this! It's a can of corn.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans. Alright, I'll give it a try. ''[jumps on board and floats off into space]'' Sandy, this doesn't seem right.}}
{{L|Sandy|Uh oh! Looks like SpongeBob's too light for lunar gravity. SpongeBob, grab a hold of this! ''[lassos asteroid to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grabs onto asteroid]'' Ok. ''[the rock pulls SpongeBob to the moon surface. SpongeBob begins to surf the moon, but screams]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Wow, SpongeBob! What do you call that trick? ''[SpongeBob keeps screaming]'' Interesting. Maybe you can teach me how to do a “Waaaaah!”}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[SpongeBob continues screaming, and begins to surf over a satellite]'' Hey, this is kind of fun! [leaps, and bounces off the satellite, damaging it]}}
{{L|Frankie Billy|''[shifts to Patrick watching TV]'' Carol, your real father is… ''[TV goes out due to satellite damage]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey! Who's Carol's real father?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[scene returns to SpongeBob]'' Watch this Sandy! ''[ties an asteroid to his helmet to hold him down]'' Alright. A no-look... let's see... a one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up… ''[accidentally smashes into rocket's fuel tank, making it leak]'' puncture into the side of the rocket.}}
{{L|Sandy|You did great, SpongeBob! But, you should call your trick the "no-look, one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up, puncture the fuel tank on the rocket.”}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oops!}}
{{L|Sandy|Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get while there's still enough fuel to make it home!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait! I have to do something very important! ''[takes picture of himself “holding the earth”]'' There! ''[both go into the rocket, and head for earth]'' So, we are going to make it, aren’t we Sandy?}}
{{L|Sandy|If the fuel holds out, there's no reason to panic. ''[rocket fuel signs shows “Empty”. Rocket starts falling to earth]'' Without the engines, we've lost all control. We're coming in too steep!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Is that bad?}}
{{L|Sandy|''[unbuckles seatbelt]'' Only if you consider being consumed in a giant fireball “bad”.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, in that case, I won’t… giant fireball?! ''[unbuckles seatbelt, but hits wall]'' Sandy, where are you going?}}
{{L|Sandy|'m going to take this bull by the horns! ''[Lassos the nose of the rocket. Rocket begins to catch fire as it descends towards earth]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?}}
{{L|Sandy|Not if I can keep her nose up we aren't. Hang on! It's gonna get bumpy when we hit the atmosphere. ''[the rocket keeps falling at a faster rate. SpongeBob yells in terror]'' Yeehaw!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[continues screaming]'' My goodness!}}
{{L|Sandy|Yeehaw! Yeehaw! ''[rockets crashes]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, oh my gosh! Sandy! Sandy, are you okay? ''[Sandy groans]'' Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I ruined your vacation.}}
{{L|Sandy|Ruined? Oh heck no! That was the most fun I've had in a toad's age! Once I get my rocket fixed, you and me is heading to Mars. Now, let's go grab another one of them sheet cakes. }}
{{L|Both of them|''[laugh]''}}
