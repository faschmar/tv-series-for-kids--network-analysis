{{EpisodeTranscript}}
{{L|''[The scene starts at the Krusty Krab in Mr. Krabs' office. SpongeBob is stirring on a barrel tub. Mr. Krabs comes with a bag of coral dust and a bucket of algae paste.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Just a couple more additives, SpongeBob. ''[Mr. Krabs dumps the ingredients in the barrel. The smell and aroma causes SpongeBob's face to disintegrate and his nose disappears. Mr. Krabs is seen wearing a nurse's mask.]'' Oh, and try not to breathe the fumes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Is it toxic patty Tuesday?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Barnacles, no. ''[shows many dirty money bills]'' The customers keep passing off their dirty money. So we're cooking up the only solution powerful enough to clean it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well then, let's get cleaning.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hold on, kiddo. We still have one more ingredient. ''[Takes out a bottle of Disulfide, SpongeBob takes the bottle and takes the lid off.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How much do we need?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Careful, SpongeBob! Just two drops and that stuff could-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Got it. Two dro- ''[Squeezes out some drops in the barrel. A loud explosion occurs and SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are smeared in black and their faces are blown up.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|-blow our faces off.}}
{{L|''[A ringing is heard. SpongeBob looks at the fax machine.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Fax coming through, boss.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|We can get it later.}}
{{L|''[Fax prints out Plankton]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[laughs maniacally]'' Infiltration achieved. Phase one, complete. ''[Jumps down and goes to kitchen]'' Now for phase two. ''[Saws a slit in SpongeBob's spatula and blows away the dust]'' Sabotage!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Whistling. Plankton puts the spatula back and hides]'' Well, my dependable spatula, shall we? ''[Puts patties on the grill. Tries to flip a patty and the spatula breaks. SpongeBob screams.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Wow, phase two is great! My favorite phase so far. ''[laughs and runs out of the kitchen.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Wipes ingredients off of the counter and lays down the spatula. Panting. Puts his ear up to the spatula]'' No pulse. ''[Does CPR using two fingers]'' We're losing him! Hang in there, buddy!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Looking into the kitchen from his office door]'' What's all the ruckus?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Using a defibrillator]'' Clear! Clear!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Pull yourself together, boy. So your spatula snapped. Go get yourself a new one!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Looking at the broken handle that Mr. Krabs is holding. Dramatic music plays]'' I'll never forget you.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Slaps SpongeBob away]'' Quit that, boy. It's creepy. Spatulas can't talk. ''[Walking back to his office]'' And if I catch yous talking to your next one, I'll lock you up in a padded kitchen.}} 
{{L|''[Scene cuts to Harvey's Spatula Emporium.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[laughs]'' Just like clockwork. The twerp approaches. ''[SpongeBob whistling]'' Time for phase three. ''[Boosts up with the jet pack and leaves the store. Flies into one of SpongeBob's pores and flies back out another, landing face down on the ground. Groans and mumbles]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, hi, Plankton! ''[Picks Plankton up]'' What brings you to Harvey's Spatula Emporium?}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, just picking up one of these. ''[Holds up red circular object]'' Not that you'd know what it is.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, judging from its diameter and vermillion color, I am looking at the handle cap for a vintage Grill Force 700 Spatula.}}
{{L|Plankton|Wow! A fellow spatula enthusiast, I see. You're right, SpongeBob. But with a few modifications, it'll serve as the end-cap for my SizzleMaster.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I've never even heard of that model.}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, there is only one. And some say it has magical grilling powers.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! I must know more.}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, you could come over and check it out.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That sounds thrilling! But I do need to hurry back to work.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Knocking on SpongeBob]'' SpongeBob, it's a magical spatula with a legend. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. ''[Jumps onto SpongeBob's hat]'' Onward to the Chum Bucket! ''[laughs]'' Hey, it's this way, kid. ''[SpongeBob's legs rotate and he walks the other direction]''}}
{{L|''[At the Chum Bucket. Plankton and SpongeBob are standing at the doorway of the spatula room]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Feast your absorbent eyes on this! ''[claps twice]''}} 
{{L|''[Spatulas are seen everywhere, lining up and down against the walls]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' Wow. This is the greatest spatula collection on the whole seafloor.}}
{{L|Plankton|These are nothing compared to...''[claps 3 times. Spotlight turns on and spatula rises in a container]''...the majestic SizzleMaster! ''[SpongeBob sings in a heavenly choir voice and draws the outline of the spatula with his hand]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes, SpongeBob. I believe the SizzleMaster has found its fry cook in you! ''[Kicks glass cover off of the spatula. Glass shatters]'' The legend of the SizzleMaster has been fulfilled. ''[Gives the spatula to SpongeBob]'' And since you are its fry cook, it will reduce your workload tenfold!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, that rhymes. Almost.}} 
{{L|''[SpongeBob walks out of the Chum Bucket]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes, a legend has been fulfilled today. Go forth, SpongeBob. Wouldn't want you to miss the lunch rush. ''[Now talking more sinisterly]'' Or as I like to call it, "Phase 4."}}
{{L|Karen|Phase 4? ''[Rolls up next to Plankton]'' How many phases are there in this convoluted plan?}}
{{L|Plankton|Enough, my sarcastic wife. Enough to gain SpongeBob's trust, then steal the Krabby Patty formula right from under his dumb yellow nose! ''[Now standing at a control panel. Laughs]'' Now to tune in SpongeBoob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[holding new spatula]'' I'm back, Mr. Krabs. Did I miss anything?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You're gonna be missing a job if you don't get in that kitchen. The lunch rush is nigh!}} 
{{L|''[Plankton laughs while he is listening in from the Chum Bucket.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|These orders have really piled up. ''[Holding pile of orders with larger piles behind him]''}}
{{L|Squidward|And don't forget these. ''[Dumps more orders over SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Swipes away the orders in the air]'' Well, nothing me and the SizzleMaster can't handle.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' That's right, SpongeBob! Let's show this lunch rush what for!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmm. I must be hearing things, 'cause Mr. Krabs says spatulas can't talk.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Well, I can! The mystical SizzleMaster can do all!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs said he'd put me in a padded kitchen if he caught me talking to you.}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[startled]'' I wasn't talking to my spatula!}}
{{L|Squidward|I don't care if you were. The customers are about to snap!}} 
{{L|''[Customer looking very mad and crooks his head appears in the following scene.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Time to focus. ''[flips patty]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' You know, SpongeBob, there's a much faster way to do this.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh? ''[The spatula goes under one patty and expands out to under 4 patties, then flips]'' Wow, pretty good. But we're a long, long way from filling all these orders.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Hey Sponge, I know a way to double our productivity. I'll handle things here at the grill, alone, while you man the condiments, huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey! That's a great idea! But you man the condiments, I'll take the grill. Sorry, but I don't trust anyone with this baby, but me.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Drat!}}
{{L|Nat|Hey, Squid guy! Where's my lunch? ''[Grabs onto the register]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Stay back, you ravenous brutes. Oh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Puts plate of Krabby Patties on Squidward's head making his hat fall off]'' Orders, ahoy! ''[Squidward places patties on customers plates]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, SizzleMaster, you truly are magical. We're catching up. But we got an empty grill here.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Leave it to me, kid. ''[SizzleMaster opens the freezer, gets patties and tosses them on the grill]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|All right, good night, boyo. Headin' home. Thanks for all the extra greenbacks you earned me today. ''[Holding sack of money]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't thank me, Mr. Krabs. ''[Cleaning spatula]'' Thank my new magic talking spatula.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ooh, that's great SpongeBob. ''[walking away, then quickly stops]'' Wait a minute. What did I tell ya about talking to spatulas? Only do it if it makes me money. ''[chuckles]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, you can really do wonders, SizzleMaster. Today was great. ''[Hangs SizzleMaster on spatula rack]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' It sure was, SpongeBob. And maybe tomorrow I can even handle the grill for you, huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Unlikely. But a spatula can dream. See you tomorrow.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Dang it! I need SpongeBob to trust me behind that grill for this plan to work. Hmm. Oh! Hey SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' How about you take me back to your place tonight? I mean, I could help you around the house.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I'm not going to be grilling tonight, but thank you.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Oh, I am so much more than a patty flipper.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Jumps into SpongeBob's hand]'' I'm a multipurpose tool.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh. Hey, do you clean snail litter boxes?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Sure!}}
{{L|Karen|''[From Chum Bucket]''Gross.}}
{{L|Plankton|It's not like it's actually me touching it, so...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Here she is. Home sweet pineapple.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Infiltration complete. Time to execute phase five! ''[evil laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' You're such a joyful being, SizzleMaster. Here's that litter box you said you'd clean. ''[Tosses spatula into the litter box]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' ''[Sniffs. Gah!]'' Karen! I thought I told you not to put smell sensors on the spatula!}} 
{{L|''[The next morning. SpongeBob's foghorn alarm goes off. SizzleMaster flips SpongeBob out of bed]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoop!}} 
{{L|''[SpongeBob lands upside down. SizzleMaster flips his clothes and they fly off the hanger and onto SpongeBob. SizzleMaster brushes SpongeBob's teeth then feeds Gary and gives SpongeBob cereal. SpongeBob takes a bite]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mmm, mmm. ''[SpongeBob bounces to work on SizzleMaster]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! I'm three hours early to work. Thanks to you, SizzleMaster.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' That's no problem, buddy. ''[pulls up a chair]'' Hey, why don't you take a seat while I get to work for you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, don't mind if I do. ''[Sits]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Would you like me to man the grill for you today?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, eh...}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' ''[Pulls up barrel as footstool]'' You deserve a break. And I've been able to handle everything else for you, so...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That is true. Well, I guess I can trust you with my grill while I take a brief respite.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' ''[Jumps away. Laughs maniacally]'' Yes! Phase five is finally complete! Time to kick phase six into overdrive! ''[Throws pile of patties onto the grill. Turns the heat up]'' Yes, burn patties, burn! ''[Patties catch fire and turn to ashes. Evil laughing. Sweeps away ashes and some get into SpongeBob's mouth]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Snoring. Then gags and coughs. Takes ash off the tongue and inspects it] ''Charred Krabby Patty bits? SizzleMaster, what happened?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Oh, SpongeBob, I'm sorry. I just wasn't used to this grill. All of the Krabby Patties are gone.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, no!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[As SizzleMaster]'' Hey, I got an idea! ''[SizzleMaster jumps into SpongeBob's hand]'' I can mix up some new patties in a jiff. If we just go get the Krabby Patty secret formula.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, yeah. Okay. It's just over here in the safe.}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes! Ye-e-es! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Washing money. SpongeBob is opening the safe in Mr. Krabs' office]'' Hey, whatcha doin', boy?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, my new magical talking spatula that I got from Plankton says it needs your Krabby Patty secret formula.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, no! Uh, I mean, it was your talkin' spatula, you say? That you got from Plankton? Well, why didn't you say so? ''[Pulls piece of paper out of his shirt]'' Here. Give your talkin' spatula this recipe. ''[Mr. Krabs winks twice]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, I think your blinker's broken.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Just read it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye, aye! Okay SizzleMaster, the first ingredient is... five gallons combustible cooking oil.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[At Chum Bucket]'' Yes! Karen, begin production! ''[cooking oil comes out of the machine into tub]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|One sack coral dust, extra spicy. One bucket fire algae paste. And the final ingredient, disulfide.}}
{{L|Plankton|Y-y-yes! ''[laughs]'' Wait how much disulfide?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Mr. Krabs writes down on paper]'' The whole enchilada.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Pouring bottle]'' I had no idea this stuff was approved for restaurant use.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, it's not... Plankton.}}
{{L|Plankton|Krabs? ''[Plankton sees "Danger! Explosive" on the bottle]'' Oh, no.}} 
{{L|''[Chum Bucket explodes. Karen and Plankton land in front of the Krusty Krab.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Quite a volatile concoction, eh, Planky?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Must be explosive patty Wednesday, eh, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' You got that right, boyo. ''[keeps laughing]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[sarcastically]'' Oh, hardy-har-har!}}
