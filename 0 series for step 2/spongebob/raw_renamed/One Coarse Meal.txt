{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[turns off the lights, lights an incense stick, turns on the radio, takes off his shirt and bathes in money]'' Ahh, that's the stuff. Right there. ''[sniffs]'' Something don't smell right. ''[scene cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen and Mr. Krabs opens the door]'' SpongeBob! Say, what are you burning out here, boy?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sniffs]'' Hmm... I'd say a high grade explosive.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Explosive!? ''[scene cuts to outside the Krusty Krab where Plankton is flying on a glider laughing evilly]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Ha ha ha ha! Enjoy, Eugene! ''[activates a bomb, which blows up the roof]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[muffled]'' Plankton! ''[bites the wood in half hard with his teeth]''  I just had that roof redone last week!}}
{{L|Plankton|You will be re-re-doing it after I'm through with you!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ready ammunition! ''[SpongeBob takes off his hat and it reveals a pea can. Mr. Krabs opens the can with his claw and he pours all the peas into SpongeBob. He then uses SpongeBob as a gun]'' Fire! ''[SpongeBob shoots peas at Plankton. The peas shoot through Plankton's air glider. But Plankton blows a bubble over himself causing the peas to be deflected. The deflected peas hit the frying pans. One of the frying pans falls and hits SpongeBob. Plankton then fires a missile at them]'' Take cover! ''[picks up SpongeBob and uses him as a shield, but the missile just falls straight to the ground]'' Oh, ha, ha, it didn't go off! ''[laughs]'' Another dud, Plankton.}}
{{L|Plankton|A dud, huh? ''[pushes a button which causes the missile to transform into a robotic arm and it squeezes Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, you're playing with fire now, Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|No need to get worked up over this, Krabs, just give me the secret formula and I’ll be on my way. }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You ain't getting it.}}
{{L|Plankton|I implore you to reconsider. ''[presses the button and  his arm squeezes harder]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Go jump off a plank.}}
{{L|Plankton|I have ways of getting the information I need. Where’s the formula, Krabs? ''[tickles Mr. Krabs' posterior with a feather]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughing wildly]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Still not going to talk, eh, Krabs? ''[tickles Mr. Krabs' nose with the feather causing him to sneeze and blowing Plankton to the ground]'' Okay, Krabs, I see you're not going to crack. But I don't think your underling is of the same metal.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll never talk.}}
{{L|Plankton|We’ll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, okay! But I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula. He won't let me near it.}}
{{L|''[Everyone pauses]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Clever. Behind the painting, eh, Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[growls]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Incidentally, what am I smelling? You got something burning?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sniffs]'' Smells like blubber to me.}}
{{L|Plankton|Bl-bl-blubber?}}
{{L|Pearl|''[comes in]'' Daddy!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[screams]'' Call off your daughter, Krabs! Call her off!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|She's a big girl, Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, and you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today.}}
{{L|Plankton|Stay back, whale! I'm privy to what you do to organisms like me. I've seen those documentaries! ''[as he says this he backs up into the freezer]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Did he just go into the freezer?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[exits freezer and walks out the door]'' Don't say it!}}
{{L|Pearl|I prefer salad over Plankton, anyway.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales? ''[chuckles evilly]'' Pearl, me darling daughter, you saved my business and my formula, now get us out of this trap.}}
{{L|Pearl|Mall money.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs gives a dollar to Pearl out of his chest like an ATM machine.]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Thanks, Daddy. [pulls SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs out of the claw and puts them down.]}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Why don't you swing by the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a scare.}}
{{L|Pearl|Double my mall money!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[grunts]'' ''[to SpongeBob]'' Your turn to chip in, boy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure. ''[hands Pearl dollars]'' Here you go. Buy yourself something pretty.}}
{{L|Pearl|Hey, this isn't money!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, it's even better! This is what Mr. Krabs pays me with. ''[money is shown]'' Mr. Krabs' Wacky Bucks!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[to self]'' Oh, it's all starting to catch up with me... ''[to Pearl]'' Please, Pearl? I'll do your homework for you.}}
{{L|Pearl|No way! The Chum Bucket is, like, totally gross!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hmmm... in that case, Pearl, I'm gonna need to borrow one of your dressers.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Pearl|Hummina-hunh? Huh?!}}
{{L|''[Cut to the Chum Bucket]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[runs inside]''}}
{{L|Karen|My triumphant husband returns. How'd you fail this time?}}
{{L|Plankton|Krabs had a whale!}}
{{L|Karen|You mean his big, bad, scary teenage daughter?}}
{{L|Plankton|I hear that mocking tone in your voice, Karen, and I don't appreciate it. Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?}}
{{L|''[Plankton's family is shown being eaten by a whale]''}}
{{L|Karen|Okay, when you need a break from your delusional paranoia, the trash needs some attention. It's ripened.}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to Plankton taking out the trash]''}}
{{L|Pearl (Krabs)|''[emerges from the dumpster]'' I'm hungry!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[screams and runs back inside and bars the door, then hides at the transmutator]'' That should keep her out!}}
{{L|Pearl (Krabs)|''[sneaks up behind him, breathing heavily]'' I want plankton meat!}}
{{L|Plankton|Holy protozoas! ''[runs out of the lab]'' Karen, she's here! She got in!}}
{{L|Karen|What are you talking about?}}
{{L|Plankton|There's a whale in the laboratory!}}
{{L|Karen|Are you out of your mind?}}
{{L|Plankton|See for yourself!}}
{{L|Karen|''[checks the lab]'' No whale in here.}}
{{L|Plankton|I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!}}
{{L|Karen|Oh, that's enough, Plankton. If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to more pertinent binary functions. ''[rolls away]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Karen! Karen--!}}
{{L|Karen|''[in sing-song]''  I'm not listening. ''[hums]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|16 paranoia filled days later...}}
{{L|Karen|''[off microphone]'' Plankton, your dinner is ready. Plankton? Plankton, do you hear me? ''[showing Plankton sitting on his chair with long gray hair, long beard, long fingernails, and two boxes of tissues on his feet as shoes]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes, I can hear you. Can you bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me. ''[cries]'' ''[camera zooms out to the outside window where Pearl/Krabs looks at Plankton evilly]''}}
{{L|Pearl (Krabs)|''[laughs. Bubble transition to night.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[scene of Plankton in his bed, grunting while sleeping]'' No! No! No! No! ''[starts having a nightmare, being chased by Pearl and falls into her blowhole and lands in her mouth]'' Whoa! ''[banging on Pearl's teeth]'' Hey! Get me out of here! ''[Pearl laughs evilly, then flings him into her throat with her tongue]'' Oh, no! ''[screams as he falls into her stomach, where his ancestors find him.]''}}
{{L|Grand-Dad|Hey, Plankton! Glad you could join the rest of the family!}}
{{L|Plankton|Grand-Dad?}}
{{L|Grand-Dad|Yep, and you're pretty brave standing in that there gastric acid.}}
{{L|Plankton|Gastric acid?! ''[his body is half-burned and he screams]''}}
{{L|Pearl| ''[cackles, thunder and lightning strike]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[wakes up from nightmare and screams]'' I can't take it! ''[cries]'' This is driving me crazy! ''[continues crying]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[takes off disguise and laughs. Bubble transition to morning]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[crying]'' What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale! ''[lies down]'' That's it. I'm done. The 4:15 bus should be along any time now.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, Plankton. What are you doing laying in the middle of the road?}}
{{L|Plankton|Go away, Cheese head! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet, just step on me as hard as you can. Would you do that for me?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature.}}
{{L|Plankton|Forget it, kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay!}}
{{L|''[Cut to the Krusty Krab, in Mr. Krabs' office]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[erases a picture of Plankton]'' Goodbye, pipsqueak!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry to interrupt your gloating, sir. I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Really? He's a mess! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Need I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No need to remind me, sir. I broke Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, sir. I can fix this.}}
{{L|''[scene cuts to Plankton]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[angrily]'' Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, Plankton.}}
{{L|Plankton|What do you got? Mud in your ears? Take a hike!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah, yes, I remember. But very quickly, I just wanted to tell that the Krabby Patty secret formula is not, I repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab.}}
{{L|Plankton|Why should I care? All meaning has left my life ever since I've been plagued by that blasted whale.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's okay. Everybody has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is... ''[whispers in Plankton's ear]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Really?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mmm-hmm, and guess what else? That was Mr. Krabs in a whale suit that you've been scared of.}}
{{L|Plankton|You mean this entire time it's been Krabs masquerading as a whale!? ''[angrily]'' Why that conniving bottom feeder!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, luckily, you wouldn't have use for such innocuous information, would you?}}
{{L|Plankton|Uh, of course not.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, all-righty, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thanks for the talk!}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, no, thank you! ''[laughs evilly. Bubble transition]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Whoo-ho! This is too much fun! ''[puts on the Pearl costume]'' I think I found me second calling.  ''[opens the door]'' Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, is that so?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Plankton? Oh, Back for more, are you? Oh, well, here it goes. ''[breaths deeply]'' Boo!}}
{{L|Plankton|You don't scare me, Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I ain't Krabs, I'm... I mean... ''[Pearl's voice]'' I'm Pearl, not Krabs.}}
{{L|Plankton|The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, and your secret fear!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Secret fear? ''[regular voice]'' What are you talkin' about?}}
{{L|Plankton|See for yourself. ''[the robotic arm squeezes Mr. Krabs]'' Enjoy the show! ''[a mime is shown]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No. No. No! Muh-muh-make it stop! Make it stop! ''[cries]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[laughing evilly]'' Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, does it scaredy pants? ''[laughs]'' I am loving this.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Plankton, if I were you, I wouldn't be so smug.}}
{{L|Plankton|Why not?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding. ''[Plankton gasps. Whales are outside.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[scared]'' ''[screams]'' Not another feeding! Get me out of here! ''[removes a nail from the floor and jumps inside. SpongeBob puts a cork in the hole, turns off a projector, making the whales disappear, and gets Mr. Krabs out of the robot arm]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Whew! Well, you redeemed yourself, boy.  ''[to mime]'' Okay, you really are creeping me out now.}}
