{{L|Plankton|My evil genius video diary by Sheldon J. Plankton. ''[Plankton appears in a video tape on a computer screen.]'' Greetings. It is I, Plankton! ''[The screen fuzzes to another part]'' I'm sorry. I'm not myself today. ''[The screen fuzzes to another part]'' It's just the world knows me as an evil villain...}}
{{L|''[The scene cuts to a clip of Dead Eye Plankton.]''}}
{{L|Dead Eye Plankton|That's me, Dead Eye Plankton.}}

{{L|Plankton|...bent on destroying the Krusty Krab and stealing the Krabby Patty formula... ''[The scene cuts to Plankton on a rocket holding the secret formula in the bottle.]'' I've got your formula. ''[Plankton laughs.]'' Yeeha! ''[The scene cuts back to Plankton on the video.]'' ...but I'm so much more than that. Does anyone care about my hopes? My dreams? My secret passion for song? ''[The screen fuzzes to another part]'' That's right. I may have a mind of an evil genius, but I also have the voice of an angel. ''[Plankton coughs]'' ''[Attempting to sing]'' Me. Me. Me. ''[A building is shown. The windows crack.]'' Me.}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff, Frank the Red Shirt Wearing Fish, Frank the Lifeguard, and Frankie Billy appear in a classroom at Mrs. Puff's boating school. The glass breaks. The scene cuts to Bill and Nazz-Mimi sunbathing at Goo Lagoon. They sit up.]''}}
{{L|Bill|Did you hear that?}}
{{L|Nazz-Mimi|How could I not?}}
{{L|''[The scene cuts back to Plankton.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Can your normal super villain do that? I don't think so! ''[The screen fuzzes to another part]'' Alas, the world is not ready for a talent like mine, but I'll get there some day. ''[The screen fuzzes to another part]'' You better watch your back, Justin Bottomfeeder. ''[The screen fuzzes to another part]'' ''[Singing poorly]'' "N" is for anywhere at anytime at all down here in the deep- blue- seaaaaaaaaa. ''[Talking]'' That's the stuff! You haven't heard the last of me!}}
