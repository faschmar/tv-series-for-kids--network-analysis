{{L|Plankton|Eh, that's the life.}}
{{L|Karen|''[screen changes to herself]'' Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|Hey, I was watching that!}}
{{L|Karen|And I'm tired of watching you sit around all day. Admit it, the Chum Bucket is a total failure.}}
{{L|Plankton|It is not! Business is just slow.}}
{{L|Karen|Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah. If you'd take my advice, the Krabby Patty recipe would be yours.}}
{{L|Plankton|You? You're just a computer. I'm the evil genius around here.}}
{{L|Man|''[door bangs open]'' This is it, son, the Chum Bucket.}}
{{L|Plankton|Looks like this failure has a customer. Hello. Are you lost?}}
{{L|Man|No, we're not lost. I promised my boy I'd take him to the Chum Bucket today.}}
{{L|Plankton|Really?}}
{{L|Man|Wow, look at that order window! It's completely covered in grime and filth.}}
{{L|Kid|Cool!}}
{{L|Man|''[he smells it]'' Smell that air!}}
{{L|Kid|It makes me want to hurl!}}
{{L|Man|I think the Chum Bucket is the high point of our tour.}}
{{L|Plankton|Your tour?}}
{{L|Man|That's right. We're visiting the most disgusting places in Bikini Bottom. And so far, you're number one. Farewell, you filthy little fella. ''[the two leave]''}}
{{L|Man|What do ya say we try the city dump next?}}
{{L|Kid|Oh, boy!}}
{{L|Plankton|Groan.}}
{{L|Karen|So, how'd it go?}}
{{L|Plankton|You're right. I'm such a failure.}}
{{L|Karen|So, do you give up?}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes.}}
{{L|Karen|You'll do what I tell you now?}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes.}}
{{L|Karen|Here's all you have to do. You want the patty recipe, then go to the man who wrote it, Eugene Krabs.}}
{{L|Plankton|Right. Why didn't I think of that before?}}
{{L|Karen|With my mind connector, you'll be able to read Krabs' mind, transferring the recipe directly into your teeny, tiny, little brain.}}
{{L|Plankton|Wow, that's a pretty good idea. Whoa! Um, Karen? Whoa!}}
{{L|Karen|Hold still.}}
{{L|Plankton|Mmph!}}
{{L|Karen|You'll need this. ''[puts a smaller tool with plungers attached at the end]''}}
{{L|Plankton|And just how am I supposed to attach it to Krabs' brain?}}
{{L|Karen|Leave that to me, hon.}}
{{L|''[Doors burst open]''}}
{{L|Karen|Prepare for launch. Target in range. Launch sequence initiated.}}
{{L|Plankton|No! Wait! ''[Karen squeezes it]'' There he is! ''[launches him to Mr. Krabs, but Squidward is carrying a garbage bag]'' Get out of the way! This is it! ''[Patrick walks at outside]'' Move it! Ha, ha! You're mine!}}
{{L|''[It is SpongeBob that was holding a cardboard cutout of Mr. Krabs.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, where do you want this life-size cutout of you, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Plankton|No! ''[gets inside SpongeBob and screams]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[offscreen]'' I told ya to stop playing with that thing and get back to work!}}
{{L|Plankton|Ugh, great.}}
{{L|Karen|''[antenna comes out]'' Plankton, what happened?}}
{{L|Plankton|Thanks to your brilliant aim, honey, I'm stuck inside that fool of a fry cook.}}
{{L|Karen|Well, honey, you'll just have to change plans. Plug into his eyes to see what's going on outside.}}
{{L|''[Plankton unplugs SpongeBob's eye plugs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh? ''[his eyes go completely black as a bulb]'' Hey, Squidward, we blew a fuse!}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm gonna blow a fuse if you don't get that order up.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[plugs himself with SpongeBob’s eye plugs, his eye glows in the dark]'' It works! I can see everything SpongeBob sees.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, can somebody hit the lights?}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, where's the Krabby Patty for order 17?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Squidward, is that you? Oh, it's so dark in here. I can't see a thing.}}
{{L|Squidward|Can you just get the Krabby Patty?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure thing, Squidward. One Krabby Patty coming up!}}
{{L|Plankton|He's gonna make a Krabby Patty in front of me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[makes a different Krabby Patty, he uses the two pink sponges, aluminum]'' Oh, no, where are those patties? Oh, nuh-uh. Nuh, no. Ah, there you are, patty! Add one fluffy bun like so and a squirt of special sauce. ''[uses the soap into the "Krabby Patty"]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Heh, heh, special sauce. Wait, soap is the special sauce?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Then you grab yourself some lettuce. ''[takes out strings from the mop]'' And voilà! One perfect Krabby Patty! I only wish I could see how beautiful it looks. Number 17, your patty is ready. Whoa. Watch your step, Squidward. It is pitch black out here.}}
{{L|Squidward|Don't know, don't want to.}}
{{L|''[he pulls a customer's face and then searches in his mouth]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Order number 17. Order number 17? Order 17? Order 17? Your Krabby Patty, ma'am.}}
{{L|Plankton|That's it! I'm going somewhere else. ''[plugs back SpongeBob's eye plugs]'' Where are those eardrums? ''[SpongeBob's eyes turn back on]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, the lights are back on. ''[SpongeBob screams as he saw the "Krabby Patty" that he just made.]'' Mr. Krabs! Help me, Mr. Krabs. I've forgotten how to make Krabby Patties. Please tell me the secret recipe again.}}
{{L|''[Plankton walks up to SpongeBob's eardrums]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Finally, the eardrum. Whew. Now, I’ll just unplug this thing. ''[struggles]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Need a little refresher, eh? Okay, boy. I'll run through the Krabby Patty formula one more time. First...}}
{{L|''[Plankton unplugs the ear plugs, turning it to silent]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Let me see what I can tune in here. Hmm.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|The secret of the Krabby Patty formula is...}}
{{L|Plankton|Jackpot!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I said, the secret to the Krabby Patty formula is-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Could you speak a little louder, please?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|The secret to the Krabby Patty formula is-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hold on.}}
{{L|Plankton|Here it comes.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[into a megaphone, shouting]'' The secret to the Krabby Patty formula is...!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[screams as two drums come out, making Plankton becoming deaf. Plankton quickly unplugs the ear drums]'' Ow! I hate my life!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Is this thing loud enough?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, sure, I can hear you fine now.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What was the question again?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, it, uh-- you know, I don't remember.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Me neither. So we good?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Get out!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay!}}
{{L|Plankton|Enough with these petty carnal senses. If I'm going to get the Krabby Patty recipe, I'm gonna have to go to command central. ''[he laughs evilly]'' The brain! ''[plugs into the brain, laughs evilly]'' Ugh! ''[he acts like SpongeBob]'' Hi, friend. Why am I making idiotic comments? ''[he gasps as he saw "Superficial Greetings" on the brain]'' Superficial Greetings? What kind of idiot-- ''[sees the parts of the brain]'' Personal Opinions? Knock-knock Jokes? No, no, no, no! This is all useless! I'm gonna have to go in deeper. ''[he gets inside the brain house]'' Ugh. ''[he was in the brain version of the living room]'' Where am I?}}
{{L|Brain Gary|Meow, meow, meow! ''[it slides around it]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Ew. That's disgusting. Now, where do morons keep all their secrets? ''[he finds in the brain closet, searching in the squarepants, but not found]'' Nope. ''[then he finds under the brain bed in the brain bedroom]'' Doesn't this kid have any secrets? ''[opens door]'' Aha! The library, where he keeps records of his every thought. All of his deepest, juiciest secrets. ''[opens the file drawer]'' ''[grunting]'' In convenient alphabetical order. Look at that. Q, R, S! ''[grabs gooey file]'' "Sounds that make Squidward upset"?}}
{{L|''[he opens the file and hears SpongeBob's laughs.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|"Patrick's favorite places to be scratched"?}}
{{L|Squidward|What are you doing? ''[SpongeBob is scratching Squidward's back]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, uh, scratching!}}
{{L|Plankton|Aagh, all of these secrets are lame! Wait a minute. What's this? ''[picks up a pink paper that says "Krabby Patty Recipe"]'' The secret recipe isn't in the brain? It's located in the heart. How cheesy.}}
{{L|''[Plankton slides down SpongeBob's spine and he lands to the heart]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Ugh. Uh. ''[Plugs to the heart]'' The Krabby Patty recipe. Yes, yes, yes! Here it is! ''[his lips are licking]'' My mouth is watering. My taste buds are tingling! ''[cut to Plankton's tongue sparkling]'' Mm, mm. Oh, yeah! It feels so good! I can feel it all the way to my finger...stumps. All of the ingredients coming together in perfect harmony. And it's all mine! ''[he laughs evilly, sounding like SpongeBob]'' Hwuh. Okay, that was weird. Like I was saying, the Krabby Patty recipe is...the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab! Hwuh. Who said that?! ''[strains]'' What's happening to me? ''[he gasps]'' It's all warm and fuzzy! It's --- ''[Plankton's body is transforming, sponge emerges out on him]'' It's --- ''[He grows eyelashes, his eye rolled to SpongeBob, and his teeth shatters, grows buckteeth.]'' It's...beautiful! ''[he laughs]'' All of the delicious ingredients living in perfect harmony.}}
{{L|Karen|You got the recipe?}}
{{L|Plankton|I sure did!}}
{{L|Karen|Well, what are you waiting for? Bring it back to the Chum Bucket.}}
{{L|Plankton|Karen, wouldn't that be stealing?}}
{{L|Karen|Stealing?}}
{{L|Plankton|The Krabby Patty recipe is the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab.}}
{{L|Karen|Oh, brother. ''[she presses a button, Plankton is emerging out of SpongeBob's nostril]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, everybody! Wait, that's not what I wanted to say. Now, what was it?}}
{{L|Plankton| ''[Plankton lands on Patrick's forehead, begins to transform, the camera shows Plankton's brain as it shrinks and pops,  Plankton signs]'' Huh? ''[his hand changes to a starfish, eyelashes fall, his eye roll to Patrick buckteeth shatters and grows a tooth, he sighs as Plankton's body turn pink]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, well. Never mind. ''[Karen's hand opens the door, and removes Plankton from Patrick]''}}
{{L|Karen|Well, where's the recipe?}}
{{L|Plankton|The what?}}
{{L|Karen|I knew you'd louse this up.}}
{{L|Plankton|Louse what up?}}
