{{L|''[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab where Squidward is selling his paintings.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Ladies and gentlemen, behold my wondrous paintings!}}
{{L|''[The customers ignore him and continue eating their foods. Squidward moans and gets really angry.]''}}
{{L|Nat|Um, excuse me, can I have some ketchup?}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey, look at my arts, you dummy!}}
{{L|''[Nat falls over, splattering patties all over SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[wipes the patties off his face]'' I don't know how you talked me into this art show, SpongeBob, but I'm shutting this thing down right now! ''[wipes the patties off SpongeBob's face]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aw, you can't, Mr. Krabs. Wait until Squidward sells some of his paintings.}}
{{L|Squidward|Buy some important paintings. See me expose my exquisite suffering.}}
{{L|''[The customers continue to ignore Squidward and continue eating their foods.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Hmph! These fools don't even recognize the masterworks in front of their faces. I'll confront them with the power of my art!}}
{{L|''[Squidward runs up to a customer with a painting of himself with a shirt on.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Witness the beauty!}}
{{L|''[The customer spits his food onto the painting.]''}}
{{L|Larry|Come on, Larry! Get your salad on!}}
{{L|Squidward|Come on, Larry! Get your art on! ''[holds up a painting of his muscular self with a sea bear]''}}
{{L|Larry|''[his eyes flare up]'' Oh! My eyes! Ahh! ''[pulls his burning eyes out and his innards flare up as well]'' The pain! ''[runs away]''}}
{{L|''[Squidward backs away slowly.]''}}
{{L|Orchid's son|I want a Krabby Meal!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[baby talk]'' How about some art to go with that? ''[holds up a painting of two Squidwards riding each other on the beach]''}}
{{L|Orchid's son|Ahh!}}
{{L|Orchid|''[screams]'' Run, baby, run!}}
{{L|''[Orchid and her son run out of the restaurant.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That's it! Squidward is scaring me customers away! I'm shuttin' this art show down! He's never gonna sell his paintings!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure he will! ''[holds up a painting]'' I just bought one.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gasps]'' Holy shrimp! Why would you do that to yourself?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What do you mean? I love it.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob holds the painting in front of a customer, but the customer's head burns up and his body crawls to the floor.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, Squidward is our friend and his paintings are so cheap, you should buy one just to be nice.}}
{{L|Customer|''[coughs]'' I'm good.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Nice? Nice? I don't waste my money on nice!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But think about how valuable these paintings might become.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Valuable? What do you mean?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|When art gets older, ''[his face becomes old]'' it usually gets more expensive. ''[his face becomes money]'' Squidward's paintings might be worth millions someday.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Millions?! ''[his tongue makes a dollar sign and he pushes SpongeBob]'' Out of me way! Here! ''[throws coins at Squidward and takes the paintings]'' Gimme! ''[grabs the painting he missed]'' Give it here! This is mine now!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' Now, all I need to do is sit back and watch me art grow more valuable. ''[his eyes turn into coins as he laughs]''}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|I am a very important art appraiser and I say this so-called art will never be worth a penny.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, Eugene H. Krabs does not—''[freaks out and gasps]'' I'll lose money! There must be something I can do to make this art worth lots more cash!}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|''[lowers his glasses]'' Hmm...}}
{{L|Squidward|I sold all my art? This tiny handful of coins has legitimized me! ''[puts on his beret]'' Who wants the autograph of a real artiste?}}
{{L|''[Squidward paints his signature on a tough guy's forehead, which angers him. The tough guy throws Squidward out the door.]''}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|Well, paintings can become much more valuable when the artist is no longer with us. You know. Out of the picture.}} <font color="red">''[pretends to hang himself]''</font>
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Out of the picture, eh? I think I can arrange this.}}
{{L|''[Squidward walks back in the restaurant.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Artist walking. Check me out.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Check this out. ''[holds out a delivery bag]'' I have a delivery for ya, Mr. Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|What? You can't be serious. An artist such as myself should not be subject to such menial tasks.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aw, don't be menial to Squidward, Mr. Krabs. I'll take the delivery.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No, Mr. Squidward is a real artist now and real artists can handle anything.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to Squidward walking through the arctic tundra with the delivery bag.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|The arctic is so cold! ''[shivers and the wind blows upon Squidward]'' Come on, Squidward. You're a strong artist. You can do it! ''[the wind blows him off]'' No!}}
{{L|''[Squidward is blown off the cliff and falls into the snow next to a snowman who looks like SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[shivers and looks at the snowman]'' SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sneaks up behind Squidward]'' Oh, hi, Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[screams]'' SpongeBob, what are you doing here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Just getting some ice. ''[holds up a large cube of ice]'' Fresh. ''[stuffs the ice inside his mouth and laughs]'' Need some help? ''[falls in Squidward's hole]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob lifts Squidward out of the hole as the SpongeBob-snowman comes to life. SpongeBob and Squidward walk over to an arctic sperm whale.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Here's your food.}}
{{L|''[The arctic sperm whale takes the delivery bag and pulls out a Krabby Patty frozen in ice. Then he takes a bite of the frozen patty.]''}}
{{L|Arctic Sperm Whale|Hey, this is cold! Perfect!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and the arctic sperm whale laugh. The whale slaps Squidward and he breaks into pieces.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Eeh, we'd better get you home.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs on the phone in his office.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hello, is this the art appraiser? Just wanted to let you know that me good, good friend, Squidward, is now "out of the pict—" ''[sees SpongeBob and Squidward walk in]'' Wh—wh—wh—What the seahorse?! ''[runs up with another delivery bag]'' Got another delivery for you, Squidward! ''[points to SpongeBob]'' And only Squidward!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Your eyes are so pretty.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs giggles. The scene changes to Squidward going to Rock Bottom on a bus.]''}}
{{L|Bus Driver|Next ''[raspberry]'' stop, ''[raspberry]'' Rock ''[raspberry]'' Bottom! ''[raspberry]''}}
{{L|''[Squidward exits the bus and two very creepy fish swim past him.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[reads bag]'' "237 Rock Bottom." Oh, there it is! Oh, remember, Squidward, real artists embrace the unknown. ''[goes down the ladder]'' Uh, is anyone here? ''[raspberry]'' I've got a delivery from the Krusty ''[raspberry]'' Krab!}}
{{L|''[Creepy fish come up and blow raspberries at Squidward.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Ahh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams as he appears next to Squidward]'' What are we screaming about?}}
{{L|Squidward|Monsters!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, they're not monsters, Squidward. They're my friends.}}
{{L|Angler Fish|What's ''[raspberry]'' up, ''[raspberry]'' SpongeBob? Ha. ''[raspberry]''}}
{{L|''[The angler fish and gang put on party hats and dance as they blow raspberries. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs erasing Squidward's picture on the paper.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[on the phone]'' Yes, I'm sure that Mr. Squidward is out of the picture for good. He will be missed. So, come on over and tell old Krabs how much money me paintings are worth. ''[hangs up the phone and laughs]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Squidward appear with party hats, laughing.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ha, ha, ha, he-he, ha. ''[sobbing and growls]'' Squidward, delivery! ''[gives him another delivery bag]''}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob and ties him to a chair.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ha, this tickles. ''[giggles]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Follow me, Mr. Squidward. I've got a special delivery vehicle just for a great artist like yourself.}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, that's more like it. Finally, some respect.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Into the rocket ya go!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs pushes Squidward into the rocket ship and Squidward gets strapped into the seat.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Wait! Why do I need a rocket? Where is this delivery to?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Mars. ''[closes door]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, Mars. Well, the...M—M—M—M—M—Mars?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Bye, Squidward!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs launches the rocket and it blasts off into space. The rocket flies Squidward all the way to the planet, Mars. Squidward walks towards three martians-like creatures and hands them the delivery bag.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Delivery from the Krusty Krab.}}
{{L|''[The martian takes the bag and pulls out the Krabby Patty. Then the Martian eats the patty.]''}}
{{L|Martian|Mmm! Yummy, yummy! ''[gibberish]''}}
{{L|''[The martians hover together and eat the delivery Squidward gave them.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Hmph. All this red. So garish. Ha, this dump needs a true artist touch.}}
{{L|Martians|Huh?}}
{{L|''[The martian roars and swallows Squidward whole. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab back on Earth.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So, now that Squidward definitely 100% is gone for good, what a shame, what do you think of these here paintings?}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|Well, of course they're awful, but if the so-called artist is really out of the picture, then perhaps they're worth something.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Really? ''[sobs]'' Oh, it's so complicated. These are tears of joy, but they're also tears of sadness for my good friend, Squidward. Wherever he is.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, here he is, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|''[Squidward appears in a UFO outside the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob rushes outside.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Stay here and keep an eye on me investments. ''[runs outside]''}}
{{L|''[The UFO drops Squidward off and flies away, leaving him covered in slime. Squidward is paralyzed at the events on Mars, but recovers quickly.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[wipes the slime off and puts his beret back on]'' Well, that was disgusting. So, who wants to talk about my use of color and brush stroke?}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs growls.]''}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|Ahem! ''[rips the $150,000 tag]'' Hmph!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I have done everything I could to get you away from here safely and now you're messing with me money!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs pulls out a mallet and Squidward runs away, screaming.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Run, Squidward, run!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey! How about a little support here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Run, Mr. Krabs, run!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs runs off after Squidward, screaming.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But a little slower than Squidward.}}
{{L|French Narrator|3 hours later...}}
{{L|''[Squidward is still being chased around by Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs is using a human nose mask to track down Squidward. SpongeBob appears hiding behind some rocks, grabs Squidward and covers his mouth.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Psst, it's your best friend, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs continues to sniff around.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, get off of me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll never get off of you, Squidward. Not until you're safe.}}
{{L|Squidward|I'll never be safe! ''[pushes SpongeBob off]'' Not until my paintings are gone!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Squidward! You can't deprive the world of your paintings!}}
{{L|Squidward|True, but it's better than depriving the world of me!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs finds Squidward and SpongeBob behind the rocks and goes to hit them with his mallet. Mr. Krabs chases Squidward and SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab in a fast pace.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on, Squidward! Destroy those paintings before Mr. Krabs gets back!}}
{{L|''[Squidward pulls out a power saw and hesitantly goes to destroy the paintings. However, he doesn't have the guts to do it.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I...I can't do it! They're just too magnificent!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, hey, hey! Get away from me paintings!}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, I'm sorry, paintings, but it's you or me!}}
{{L|''[Squidward destroys several paintings with his power saw.]''}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|Yes, yes! Now, this is true art!}}
{{L|Squidward|What? Really?}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|So visceral! So dangerous!}}
{{L|Squidward|Yes, feel my art! ''[destroys some paintings with his power saw]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[crashes through the doors]'' Leave me paintings alone, you monster!}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|No! That was the most accelerating performance art I have ever seen!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Really? So, it must be worth millions! Hey, out of me way!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs proceeds in helping Squidward destroy all of the paintings. Then they go to destroy the office and some tables.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[chuckles nervously]'' Mr. Krabs, uh, Squidward, I—I don't think you should be doing that.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, don't be so provincial, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah, stop trying to censor our money! I mean our art!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs and Squidward continue to destroy everything in the Krusty Krab. They destroy the menu, the clock, and the cashier boat. They even destroy the table of a paid customer, who was about to eat his lunch.]''}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|''[gasps]'' Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs and Squidward continue to destroy the Krusty Krab until it is nothing but shambles. They exhaustedly walk up to SpongeBob and the art appraiser.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Whoo, boy! Hee, hee! So, how much ya gonna give me for all this? Ha, ha.}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|Nothing! Performance art is about the moment. You cannot put a price on it. ''[walks off]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What? Wait, come back here, you double-crossin'—}}
{{L|''[A piece of the roof falls on top of Squidward and Mr. Krabs, crushing them.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|D'oh! Mr. Krabs! Squidward!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob lifts the roof piece up.]''}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|Ah-ha.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to the art appraiser giving a tour around the art museum.]''}}
{{L|Art Appraiser|And that is how I acquired this masterpiece.}}
{{L|''[The masterpiece turns out to be a completely flattened Mr. Krabs and Squidward who are stuck on the fallen roof piece. The tourists chatter in wonder.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm an artist.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm rich.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And I helped. ''[laughs]''}}
