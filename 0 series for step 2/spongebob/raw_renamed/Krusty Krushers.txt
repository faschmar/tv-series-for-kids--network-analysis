{{L|Mr. Krabs|No living soul should have to suffer through what I've witnessed here today. Except maybe...}}
{{L|''[Later, SpongeBob and Patrick run to the stage blindfolded and excited and they both laugh. Mr. Krabs guides them with a leash]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Where are you taking us, Mr. Krabs? ''[they continue to laugh]''}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs releases the leash]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now go get them!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[He and Patrick laughs]'' What do you think the surprise is, Patrick?}}

{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know. What do you... ''[they both run into the wrestlers]'' Ohhh. Whatever it is, it's really big.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[pops out from one of the wrestlers' chest hair]'' And hairy.}}
{{L|''[Wrestler #2 picks up and breathes on SpongeBob who coughs every time he gets blown on]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And it smells angry.}}
{{L|Patrick|Is it time to look yet?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You peek first.}}
{{L|Patrick|No, you peek first.}}
{{L|''[Wrestler #2 squeezes SpongeBob until his eyeballs pop out and see the wrestlers and Wrestler #1 does same to Patrick. Both of them scream and get out of the wrestlers' hands and run behind Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, who are those guys, Mr. Krabs? They look like they wanna hurt us.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What? Those two? Ah, they're harmless. It's all just part of the act.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The act?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Of course. They're just pretending.}}
{{L|Patrick|Pretending?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|We like pretending.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' Don't we all?}}
{{L|Patrick|Can we wear costumes?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Eh... sure.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[turns to show his butt]'' Hey, SpongeBob, how do I look?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow. Looks like those Iron Bun workout videos are really paying off.}}
{{L|''[Cuts to Patrick at home doing his bun workouts]''}}
{{L|Woman on Exercising Video|And 2, and 3, and 4 steps closer to your dream body.}}
{{L|''[Cut to Patrick sleeping and still doing the exercise]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I can even do it in my sleep.}}
{{L|''[Scene cuts back to the wrestling arena]''}}

{{L|Patrick|Whoo!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, we're ready.}}
{{L|Announcer|''[looks at watch]'' Huh? Oh, yeah. Al, send the mike down. We got fresh meat.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Actually, we're here to fake wrestle.}}
{{L|Patrick|And to pretend wrestle.}}
{{L|Announcer|Whatever. ''[clears his voice]'' In this corner we have the challengers, the Krusty Krushers!}}
{{L|''[They both pull out a Krabby Patty and they chew it like they're tough. SpongeBob burps after he bites his. The crowd is cheering]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[burps]'' Oh, excuse me.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You can do it!}}
{{L|Announcer|And on the opposite side of the ring, we have the undefeated champions.}}
{{L|''[Wrestler #1 lifts up a barbell then Wrestler #2 crushes the barbell with his bare hands and puts it in a Krabby Patty and eats it then burps in Wrestler #1's face until his skin rips off as the crowd boos]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts... ''[As the 2 wrestlers' shadows go over them, the announcer runs away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Did it just get dark in here?}}
{{L|Patrick|Dark?! I'm afraid of the dark.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, don't be afraid. It's just them.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, right, it's just those guys we're gonna wrestle. ''[Waves at them]'' Hello, fellow competitors. ''[Wrestler #1 screams so loud that they fall to the ground]''}}
{{L|Patrick|What was that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[reading Wrestling for Beginners Book]'' That's Wrestlese for "You're dead meat."}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't get it. ''[Wrestler #1 picks up both of them and throws them]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, look, Patrick, it's Mr. Krabs cheering us on.}}
{{L|''[They crash into Wrestler #2 then SpongeBob falls into a bucket]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa.}}
{{L|''[Patrick also lands into the bucket on top of SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, hey, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Patrick. Look, Patrick, ''[points to wrestler]'' it's a fist.}}
{{L|Patrick|A fist? Where? ''[turns around]'' Oh, yeah, that's definitely a...}}
{{L|''[They both get punched more and more until they turn to liquid. Wrestler #1 gargles SpongeBob and Patrick and spits them out into the drain. The crowd groans as they slosh down the drain. An impatient Mr. Krabs uses a plunger to get them out.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Yeah!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How fun was that?}}
{{L|Patrick|It was so super duper fun. ''[They do a Pattycake like handshake]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Boom!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs clears his throat]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Did you need something, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, did I need something? Hmm, let me think. Did I need something? ''[suddenly angry voice]'' Yes, I need something! I need you 2 to get back in there and show them who's boss! Show them what Short Order Boy and Pink Patty can really do!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Right! C'mon, Patrick, let's show these two who they're messing with.}}
{{L|Patrick|With pleasure.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Let's do this!}}
{{L|''[They both walk away with angry expressions]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That's the million dollar winning spirit.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Alright, you two, no more messing around. You see this? ''[pulls out his spatula]'' It's just a spatula, right? Wrong! Actually, this represents your face after I get through mangling it. ''[tries to bend spatula but can only bend it a little bit]'' There, you see that? It's not gonna be pretty when I get done with ya.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, good one, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, Patrick. Now you try saying something intimidating as well.}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay. ''[Takes SpongeBob's spatula]'' And if you think this is bad, wait till I get my hands on ya. ''[takes out a piece of paper]'' I'm gonna, uh... I'm gonna... tear ya to shreds! Like a... ''[struggles with ripping the paper]'' C'mon! Ah! I got a paper cut! Paper cut! ''[starts sucking his hands]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, are you okay?}}
{{L|Patrick|Huh? Oh, I'm fine. I just like to suck on my hand.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Really? Me, too. ''[They both suck on their hands. Wrestler #1 picks up Patrick and squishes him into a ball. Mr. Krabs screams thinking he's gonna get hurt but Wrestler #1 takes the rope]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh. Heh heh. Now what?}}
{{L|''[Wrestler #1 ties the rope to Patrick. He then picks up SpongeBob and puts the rope connected to Patrick behind his back. Then he pretends it's a paddleball.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' That tickles. ''[Wrestler #2 takes Patrick as a ball]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Good catch! ''[Wrestler #2 twists him and Wrestler #1 does same to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Look, I'm a...}}
{{L|Patrick|Helicopter.}}
{{L|''[They collide and are shredded into pieces. They fall into a wagon and Wrestler #1 throws the wagon in a cement truck. Both scream as the truck starts blending them and the crowd cheers. Mr. Krabs bites on the rope nervously. Inside the truck, Wrestler #2 pulls the pour lever and SpongeBob and Patrick come out as cement and go into the wagon. Whistling, Wrestler #1 pours them into deep spaces and they dry out. Wrestler #1 puts his hand in SpongeBob and writes "Jim was here" with his finger. SpongeBob giggles. Wrestler #2 puts his foot in Patrick and writes "My foot was here" with his toe. Patrick giggles. The wrestlers both laugh and butt heads. Mr. Krabs pulls them out with 2 spatulas.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What are you doing out there?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Fake wrestling.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Okay, but you still have to try to win in fake wrestling.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, we're having so much fun! Doesn't that make us winners?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Actually... ''[literally steaming mad]'' It doesn't! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick just stand there]'' Okay, okay, look. Just... ''[notices they're gone]'' Hey, where'd they... ''[gasps]'' Oh, no! Not the...}}
{{L|''[The crowd gasps]''}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Wow, now that's a serious Sleeper Hold. ''[SpongeBob is in the arms of Wrestler #1 about to go to sleep. Wrestler #1 gives SpongeBob a jellyfish plush]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, hello, Mr. Fluffy.}}
{{L|''[Patrick and Wrestler #2 is doing the same thing. Patrick does baby talk before being handed a bottle.]''}}
{{L|Crowd|Aw.}}
{{L|''[The wrestlers then put them in a bed and cover them with a blanket]''}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|And it looks like the champs are ready to end it.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|End it?!}}
{{L|Crowd|''[chanting]'' End it!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Get up! Get up, you guys!}}
{{L|''[The wrestlers dig a hole in the sand floor. Wrestler #1 grabs one of the ropes and the wrestlers use it as a slingshot to launch themselves high into the air and through the ceiling of the arena. They wrap their arms together and spin as they fall and crash back into the arena. As they do this, Perch speaks]''}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Yep. They're gonna leave more than a mark with this special move. The mother of all moves, the Flying Double Decker Atomic Headbutt of Destruction... ''[The wrestlers literally start spinning like a drill]'' with a spin.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[screams]'' C'mon, c'mon, wake up! ''[Patrick is dreaming of doing his Iron Bun exercise]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[in his sleep]'' 1 and 2 and squeeze...!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, who am I kidding? Goodbye, money. ''[goes to ringside]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Squeeze...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Goodbye, money. ''[sobs]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Squeeze...}}
{{L|''[Patrick's Iron Buns rip through his costume]''}}
{{L|Wrestlers #1 & #2|''[gasp]'' Oh no!}}
{{L|Wrestler #2|The Iron Butt!}}
{{L|''[They land on Patrick's Iron Buns and crack, then shatter into pieces that are then swept up by the janitor, who is whistling]''}}
{{L|Announcer|Ladies and gentlemen, here are your new champions!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Goodbye, mon- ... new champions?!}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|That's right, Skip. And the winner of one million dollars.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[his eyes, teeth and tongue transforms into money]'' Hello, money! ''[starts hugging the money]'' Woo-hoo! Money, sweet money!}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Or...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Or?!}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|You can take what's behind Curtain #2.}}
