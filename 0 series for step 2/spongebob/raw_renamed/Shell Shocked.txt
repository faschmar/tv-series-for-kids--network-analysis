{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[Opens with SpongeBob lying in bed with his teeth chattering. He hears a crash and sits up, awake. He thinks he imagined it and sighs with relief, but then there's another crashing sound. He picks up the phone to call for help]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hello? Hello! ''[Realizes the phone line is cut]'' Huh? The line’s been cut. ''[Slams the phone down]'' Barnacles! ''[Puts on an army helmet and gets out a tennis racket]'' I guess I’d go better take a look. ''[Gets up and legs start shaking]'' ''[Shakes around tennis racket]'' Who's there? Stay back, I'm armed! ''[Slips on a toy fire truck]'' Whoa! Whoa! ''[Falls down stairs]'' Ha, hey! ''[Flicks on the light switch. Novelty teeth chattering]'' Aha, wind-up novelty teeth! How did you wind up down here? Dahaha! ''[Fancy boot runs in circles]'' What the heck is going on with my fancy boot? ''[Goes over to fancy boot]'' Hey, knock it off! ''[Boot goes in circles faster]'' Alright, I warned you! ''[Whacks boot. The racket comes back around and hits SpongeBob in the face]'' You're a dirty fighter... I got you now! Hiya! ''[Karate chops boot. Gary bounces out]'' Gary? ''[Heads towards a sand castle near the wall]'' Noooooooooo! ''[Gary crashes underneath bucket with soap in it]'' Gary! ''[Lifts off bucket]'' Hooa! ''[SpongeBob removes the soap from Gary’s mouth]'' Phew! Thank goodness. For a minute, I thought you were hurt. ''[pats his shell, which breaks]'' ''[shocked]'' Gary, I've - I've broken your shell.}}
{{L|Gary|Meoooow! ''[starts crying in pain]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh no, you're in pain! Don't worry, I'll make it better. ''[Gives Gary a tight hug and Gary screams]'' Sorry about that. Oh, I know, ''[Picks up the cracks from Gary's shell]'' here, just use a little tape and there ya go, good as new! ''[Shell breaks off]'' Oh. Well, that's alright, because we'll find a new shell for ya. ''[later]'' SpongeBob|How about this? ''[holds up green Hawaiian shirt with orange flowers on it]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, you're right, too gaudy. ''[Pulls out a Santa hat]'' No, too last season. ''[Pulls out a gorilla mask]'' Well, I need that. Ahahaha, look, Gary! ''[Pulls out pair of SquarePants]'' Here, try this on for size.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Of course it's a shell. ''[Gary looks at SpongeBob sternly]'' Aw, come on, don't look at me like that. ''[The slime on Gary's back covers the pants and the wet pants go soggy]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, you're right, it's not a shell. ''[Starts thinking]'' Oh! ''[Comes back with a clear helmet over his head]'' Greetings, earthling, I am SpongeBob. I come from the future. Dahahaha. ''[takes off helmet]'' I bet this'll look great. ''[Puffy skin swirls up inside helmet]''. Ew. I can see why snail shells aren't clear. ''[Takes helmet from Gary]'' Hmmm.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Here it is, Gary, your new shell! ''[puts on race driver helmet]'' Oh, you look ready to ride. ''[Gary throws magazine at SpongeBob]'' "Shell Spiffy". Great idea, Gare, I'll order you a new shell. Are there any you have your mind on, ol' buddy? ''[Shows Gary magazine]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, page seventy-two. Here it is - wow! ''[Looks the same as Gary's old shell]''. "This stylish fully insulated, dual coat ceramic shell comes with automatic rest-room facilities standard, and for the affordable price of just... 9595.95"!? Isn't there a place I can get a quality shell without spending a fortune?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Commercial? What commercial? ''[he looks at the TV, where a commercial is playing]''}}
{{L|Commercial Voice|Uh-oh, now look what you've done. You've broke your snail's shell again.}}
{{L|Actor|Yeah. Now what do I do?}}
{{L|Angry Jack|You come on down to Angry Jack's Shell Emporium!}}
{{L|Commercial Voice|''[Drop scene with shop name on it]'' Angry Jack's!}}
{{L|Angry Jack|I'm so angry about my massive inventory that I'm slashing prices like crazy.}}
{{L|Commercial Voice|Jack's angry!}}
{{L|Angry Jack|Ninety-nine ninety-nine, buy this refurbished shell and I'm angry about it. ''[holds up a pink shell]'' Or what about this one? Brand new plastic shell, super gloss coat, only thirty-nine ninety-nine. ''[The price flashes in front of his eyes]'' Hey! Get those numbers outta my face! ''Did I mention I'm angry?''}}
{{L|Commercial Voice|He's seething with rage!}}
{{L|Angry Jack|The wife's gone for good, so I'm gonna sell sell sell all these shell shell shells! So come on down to Angry Jack's now.}}
{{L|Commercial Voice|Jack is real mad! Don't bring your kids.}}
{{L|Angry Jack|And remember, I'll match or beat anyone's advertised rage or your shell is absolutely – ''[Notices SpongeBob]'' Hey, what are you doing in my commercial?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, sorry, Angry Jack. Gary here needs a new shell, and we knew you would help us find one. Hey, shouldn't you be yelling at me right now?}}
{{L|Angry Jack|Nah, I just do that to make my commercials louder. And louder is the same as better! Now, let's see if I can't get you into a new shell. Hmmm. ''[starts scanning shelves]'' There she is! ''[Takes the same shell as Gary's old one]'' There you are, little guy.}}
{{L|Gary|''[happily]'' Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, it's perfect! Just like the old one hey, buddy? ''[Shell falls off and breaks]'' Now, it... really looks like the old one, eh, buddy?}}
{{L|Gary|''[irritably]'' Meow.}}
{{L|Angry Jack|Hey, accidents will happen. Why don't we try this one? ''[Picks up yellow shell with orange patches]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oooohh, that's nice, love the pattern. We'll take it. But first I've gotta make sure it's battened down. We don't want this one slippin' off, eh, buddy? ''[He pushes down shell so hard, then it cracks and breaks. Angry Jack looks at him angrily]'' Oops. Hey, what about that one? ''[Walks to a shell with purple and orange stripes on it. Turns around to take to Gary, but whacks it on Angry Jack]'' Oops, sorry, Jack. Hey, how much is that one? ''[Picks up shades of pink stripes, he tries to take it to Gary but he trips over lace and drops shell]''}}
{{L|Angry Jack|Why don't you just hold your snail? I'll take care of the shells.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good idea, Angry.}}
{{L|Angry Jack|So, how do ya like this one? ''[Puts on very bright-lighted shell]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, it certainly is shiny.}}
{{L|Angry Jack|It's our most reflective model.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, that is bright. ''[stumbles backwards]'' Can't... see! Ow, what was that? 'Scuse me. ''[Bashes into shell shelves and knocks them over one by one. Shelves knock each other over like dominoes. Some shell shelves spell 'oops']'' Why – can't – I – stop – breaking – shells?! ''[Screams and falls off shelf he was running along. View from outside Angry Jack's store]'' Whoops. Say, Jack, I don't suppose you have any more to show me?}}
{{L|Angry Jack|I do have one more available. It's the only certified indestructible shell I've ever seen, but I'm sure you'll find a way.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait, wait, wait. Before we do the hand-off, let me make some precautionary measures. Okay, first, ''[shoes pop from under shell bits]'' shoes are tied. Hands are dry. ''[pulls out a roll of bubble wrap]'' And now, a thick layer of bubble wrap. ''[starts wrapping shell in bubble wrap. Picks up shell, but the actual shell falls out of the bubble wrap layer and breaks]'' You, um, you sure you don't have any more in the back?}}
{{L|Angry Jack|The back? There is no back anymore.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, look on the bright side. I reduced your inventory for you.}}
{{L|Angry Jack|Reduced?! You destroyed everything! And now, you're gonna have to pay!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you really angry or ya just trying to sound louder?}}
{{L|Angry Jack|I'm really angry!}}
{{L|Commercial Voice|Blistering fury!}}
{{L|Angry Jack|And I demand immediate payment!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Takes about forty cents out his pocket]'' Take it, it's all my savings.}}
{{L|Angry Jack|This? This isn't enough to repay my fortune! I'm gonna need more.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry, that's all I got. Honest.}}
{{L|Angry Jack|No, it's not. You've got two arms and two legs, don't ya?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah.}}
{{L|Angry Jack|Gimme one of each.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay. ''[does so]''}}
{{L|Angry Jack|I'll also need some internal organs. ''[SpongeBob hands one over]'' And an eyeball. ''[SpongeBob gives him an eyeball]'' And your clothes. ''[cut to SpongeBob walking in Bikini Bottom carrying a still shell-less Gary]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sadly]'' Oh, Gary. How I wish your shell could grow back like my appendages. ''[sees box]'' Hey, I've got an idea! ''[draws a shell pattern on the box]''}}
{{L|Gary|''[angry tone]'' Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Gary, it's not that bad! Square looks good on anybody! ''[Gary starts to cry, so SpongeBob does, too]'' Oh, who am I kidding? It looks terrible on you! I know, Gary, I ruined your life! Do you have to rub it in?!? ''[Mr. Krabs pokes his head of of the dumpster behind them]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, what's with all that sniveling?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, I just, - oh - well, um… never mind that, boy. What's your problem?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I destroyed Gary's shell, and now I can't find a replacement, so I guess he'll just spend the rest of his days as a lowly slug! ''[he bawls]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|There there, boy, there there. It's not that bad. I'm sure you'll think of something.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[suddenly gets an idea]'' Mr. Krabs, perhaps you can help me find a new shell for Gary.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, I'd be honored to help you and your snivelin' snail during such desperate times, 'cause I love helping others, like helping myself. Now, how much ya got?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nothing, Mr. Krabs. I'm broke.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh. I see ''[walks away disappointed]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait, Mr. Krabs! If you help me get Gary a shell, I'll, work for free for the rest of the year.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Only if I get to cut your health benefit for ya.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Deal! ''[they high five. Cut to SpongeBob's house; his teeth are chattering, and he wakes up again]'' Another bad dream. ''[he sees a scary silhouette]'' Aaargh! ''[he shines a flashlight at Gary]'' Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry, Gary, I'm not used to your new shell. ''[something pink and fleshy enters through SpongeBob's bedroom window]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, me boy, I need to borrow a blanket.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|There ya go, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Thanks, boyo. Now I'm all toasty.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ahh. I guess "all's shell that ends shell," huh, Gary? Dahahah! That's a good one. ''[Gary goes furious and crawls back, Gary slams the door locking SpongeBob out]'' Gary? ''[pounds on the door]'' Gary? ''[Gary turns off the bedroom light]'' Gary?}}
