{{L|Patrick|Haha. Jellyfish, beware! Patrick Star is here. Jellyfish. Oh, how do you hold this again? ''[turns net upside-down so he's holding the net side]'' There. Got ya! ''[fails, uses the net as a catapult but fails again, throws the net at the jellyfish but can't get one]'' This isn't over! Hey, I'm not done with you. ''[a big jellyfish, with the net stuck in it, rises from under the ground]'' I could really use SpongeBob's jellyfishing expertise right about now.}}
