{{L|French Narrator|Ah, the Krusty Krab. Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery. Where it will be closing time right about...}}
{{L|Squidward|''[talks cheerfully as he switches the "Open" sign to "Closed"]'' Now! 8:00! [takes off his Krusty Krab uniform hat] So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is: ''[pulls out his clarinet]'' Clarinet. ''[Tom shows up at the door and knocks on it, causing Squidward to drop his clarinet]'' What?}}
{{L|Tom|Are you open?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[points to the sign]'' Read the sign.}}
{{L|Tom|''[ignores him]'' I'll have a Krabby Patty Deluxe and a double chili kelp fries.}}
{{L|Squidward|No, you won't! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life.}}
{{L|Tom|Well, fine, if you don't want my money!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[says cheerfully]'' Money?! ''[Mr. Krabs then falls from the ceiling on top of Squidward]'' You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?}}
{{L|Tom|''[pulls out cash; Sadie, an anchovy, and an old man appear behind him]'' Sure!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Mr. Squidward, ''[tears up the "Closed" sign]'' welcome to the night shift. From now on, [he puts a spare Krusty Krab uniform hat on Squidward's head] the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[gets up]'' What!? ''[crowd of fish barge in cheering and tramples Squidward]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|[gasps] Wow! Now we never have to stop working!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[gets up again]'' Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life.'' [leaves]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working! ''[gasps]'' It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease! ''[jumps on cash register counter]'' Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!}}
{{L|Squidward|No.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good! 'Cause we've got customers! ''[jumps through the window above the register, into the kitchen]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Sandals walks up to counter; Squidward hands him a baseball bat]'' Here. Please hit me as hard as you can.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Pst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen ''[giggles]'' at night!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[takes hat off; leans head on counter]'' Don't hold back.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen]'' Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night. ''[cuts to SpongeBob in the bathroom wiping it clean with himself]'' Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night. ''[cuts to SpongeBob at the grill picking up his spatula. He misses the spatula and hits the grill; screams]'' I burned my hand!...at night. ''[cuts to SpongeBob walking on the counter, singing to the tune of Charge]'' Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! Night!}}
{{L|Squidward|Will you please?! Here, ''[hands SpongeBob a bag of garbage]'' give me a moment's peace and take out the trash.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|All right! ''[takes bag from Squidward]'' Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash at niâ€” ''[stops at the door and stares at the dumpster outside in the dark]'' You mean outside?}}
{{L|Squidward|That's where the dumpster is, yes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know, Squidward, ''[leans face against window]'' it's kinda dark out there.}}
{{L|Squidward|But I thought you liked the night shift.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're right. ''[lifts bag over his head]'' For the Krusty Krab! ''[runs out of the building to the dumpster, screaming and panicking the whole way; reenters the building panting heavily. He snaps his fingers and confidently says]'' Piece of cake.}}
{{L|Squidward|So you're not afraid?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[walking past Squidward]'' Pfft, nah.}}
{{L|Squidward|Well I am. Especially after, ''[looks around, gulps]'' well, you know.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[stops and turns around]'' What? What do I know?}}
{{L|Squidward|You don't remember? It was all over the news.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Tell me, tell me!}}
{{L|Squidward|No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you. ''[gives a sympathetic look, then smiles slyly]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[excitedly]'' What happened, what happened, what happened?!}}
{{L|Squidward|You mean you've never heard the story of the ''[thinks]'' "Hash-Slinging Slasher?"}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[a little confused]'' The Slash-Bringing Hasher?}}
{{L|Squidward|The Hash-Slinging Slasher.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.}}
{{L|Squidward|Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha---''[breaks into scream]'' because that's all they have time to say, before he ''gets them!''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[begging]'' Tell me the story!}}
{{L|Squidward|Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook, just like you, only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties... it happened.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|He forgot the secret sauce?}}
{{L|Squidward|No.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|He didn't wash his hands?}}
{{L|Squidward|No.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Irregular portions?}}
{{L|Squidward|No! He cut off his own hand by mistake.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You mean like this? ''[pulls one of his arms out of socket, another one grows back in its place]'' Or like this? ''[pulls it again, another one grows back]'' Or this? ''[does it again]'' Or this? ''[does it again]'' But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or-}}
{{L|Squidward|''[interrupts]'' Except he wasn't a sponge!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[ask with all his extra hands creating a rainbow-like line]'' So?}}
{{L|Squidward|So it didn't grow back!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams]'' Oh, no! ''[all his extra arms lift their hands upwards and run away]''}}
{{L|Squidward|And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Tuesday.}}
{{L|Squidward|Tuesday night, his ghost returns to the Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' But tonight's Tuesday night!}}
{{L|Squidward|Then he'll be coming.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How will we know?}}
{{L|Squidward|There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First, the lights will flicker on and off. Next...}}
{{L|Harold|''[interrupts]'' Dude, can I have some ketchup?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, here you go. ''[hands him ketchup]'' Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there. ''[shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails]'' And finally, the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus, that ran him over! ''[shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails, starts eating his arms, the arms regrow and he eats those]'' Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways, because he's already ''dead!'' ''[SpongeBob begins eating his hands like popcorn]'' Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No.}}
{{L|Squidward|He opens the door... ''[pushes his tentacle to SpongeBob's face, making it looking like he's a door that's being opened; while doing this he imitates the sound of a creaky door opening. leans towards SpongeBob's face, which sinks in]'' He slowly approaches the ''counter!'' ''["counter" echoes menacingly]'' ...And you know what he does next?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Squidward|You really want to know?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Squidward|Are you sure you want to know?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What, what, what does he do?!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sneaks up on SpongeBob, taps him]'' He gets ya! ''[SpongeBob now screams repeatedly for about 20 seconds while Squidward is laughing]'' SpongeBob... ''[continues screaming]'' SpongeBob I wa... ''[screaming continues]'' I was ju... ''[SpongeBob's pupils are now screaming too]'' I was jus... ''[screaming continues]'' SpongeBob, I was joking!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Squidward|It's not true. None of it's true.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's not?}}
{{L|Squidward|Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ohhhhh... ''[laughs repeatedly like he did with screaming, much to Squidward's annoyance.]'' ''[cuts into later in the night. Shows Krusty Krab with a big sign that says 'Open Forever']''}}
{{L|''[Squidward is shown at the counter reading a book. Squidward hears spooky noises and feels water dripping on him but he doesn't know what it is.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[on the ceiling wearing suction cups cleaning]'' Isn't this great, Squidward? ''[Squidward screams]'' There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[says to himself]'' Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea. Who wants a Krabby Patty at 3 in the morning?}}
{{L|''[cuts to Patrick's bedroom. Patrick's alarm clock goes off.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[turns off the alarm]'' Oh, boy! 3 A.M.! ''[whips out a Krabby Patty from under his blanket and starts to eat it; cuts back to The Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here. ''[lights start to flicker on and off]'' Very funny, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Squidward|"And the lights will flicker on and off." Just like the story. I get it. ''[realizes no one is flickering the light switch and looks shocked]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day! ''[phone rings, Squidward picks it up]'' What, what, hello? Hello? Hello? ''[no one's on the other end of the line]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[walks up to the counter]'' Nice try, Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|Nice try, what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|"The phone will ring and there will be no one there." ''[raises eyebrows up and down and giggles]'' Oh, you crack me up.}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, I'm not doing this. ''[hangs up phone]'' Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights, ''[lights flicker on and off]'' and the phone, ''[phone rings]'' and the walls will ooze green slime?! ''[walls start to ooze green slime]'' No, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing? ''[hears a motor, turns his head and opens his eyes wide; a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab doors]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[walks up to the counter]'' I didn't know the buses ran this late.}} 
{{L|Squidward|They don't... ''[the bus pulls away, dropping off a man on the opposite side of the street, all Squidward and SpongeBob can see is his spooky outline.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, they're dropping someone off. ''[from the outside, the man lifts his spatula]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[screams to the point where hair grows from his head and starts wiggling]''}}
{{L|Squidward|The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The Hash-Slinging Slasher! ''[starts to cry]''}}
{{L|Squidward|At last you understand! We're doomed!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, that's not it. ''[wipes tear]'' I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me! You must really like me! ''[cries again]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, there are 2 problems with your theory. 1: I hate you. And 2: how can that be me when I'm standing right here?! ''[the man taps on the door with his spatula]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob| ''[screams to the point where his eyelashes grow and start wiggling]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Squidward|The Hash-Slinging Slasher! ''[the guy walks in the door and up to the counter, SpongeBob and Squidward hold each other in terror]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!}}
{{L|Squidward|Huh? ''[the guy reaches the counter, revealing himself to be just a regular, nerdy guy as he steps into the light]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Get away! Get away! Get out of here! You're not welcome here!}}
{{L|Richard|Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula. ''[holds up spatula, his sleeve rolls down his arm to show he has his hand]'' I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Do you have references?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[lets go of SpongeBob]'' Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights? ''[lights flicker on and off; SpongeBob, Squidward, and Richard look over  and camera darts over to see a vampire flicking a giant light switch]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Squidward and Richard|Nosferatu!}}
{{L|Nosferatu|''[smiles, light turns off]''}}
