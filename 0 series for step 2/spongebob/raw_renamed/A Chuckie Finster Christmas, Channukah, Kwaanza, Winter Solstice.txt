{{L|Rugrats| Christmas, Channukah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice time is here! ''[Tommy Pickles and Chuckie Finster walk outside and lean on the fence after Spike grabs Angelica, Phil, Lil and Dil.]''}}
{{L|Chuckie| Oh, I think there must be something wrong with me, Thomas!}}
{{L|Tommy|Diaper rash?}}
{{l|Chuckie|Nope. Our Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, and Winter Solstice are coming, But I'm not happy! ''[both walk away from the fence.]'' I just don't understand Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, and Winter Solstice, I guess. I like getting presents, sending cards and decorating trees, and spinning dreidels, and eating chocolate money, and having a harvest, feast, and brushing-- ''[The short title fades in. Cut to everyone in the play pen inside and dancing like the Peanuts characters.]''}}
{{L|Angelica|Alright, you stupid babies! Chuckie will be here in a second with our decorations. ''[notices Spike is imitating her and gets mad. Cuts to Chuckie.]''}}
{{L|Chuckie|OK, guys. I got a tree, a menorah, and corn. But I still got one question: Isn't there anyone who knows what Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, Winter Solstice is all about?}}
{{L|Tommy|Hey, man, there's no need to yell. Uh, sure, Chuckie Finster, I can tell you. Ahem. Lights please! ''[spotlight shines on the carpet]'' And there were, in the same country, people of different backgrounds, beliefs, and cultures. What ho! This shall be unto you a time of joy, peace on Earth, and good will towards peoples.}}
{{l|Angelica|You blockhead! It's about the presents! Lots of presents!}}
{{L|Rugrats|Yay, presents! Happy Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, and Winter Solstice, Chuckie Finster!}}
{{L|Voiceover|The Chuckie Finster Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, Winter Solstice special was brought to you by Dork Krabby Mint Patty. ''[Cuts to a parody of the York peppermint patty commercial]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|When I bite into a Dork Krabby Mint Patty, I get the sensation of swimming in money! Piles and piles of it! ''[takes a bite as money rains down. He laughs. Cut to Nickelodeon logo.]''}}
