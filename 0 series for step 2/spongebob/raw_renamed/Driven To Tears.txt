{{L|French Narrator|It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm ready! ''[walking up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School with Patrick]'' I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?}}
{{L|Patrick|Right here, buddy. ''[takes them out of his pocket]'' Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards. ''[eats the cards]'' Mmm.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, learning tastes good.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, I needed those.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|57 times.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm a winner?}}
{{L|Patrick|Who's a winner?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sadly]'' I'm a winner.}}
{{L|Patrick|Who's a winner?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[cheered up a little]'' I'm a winner.}}
{{L|Patrick|Who's a winner?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! ''[runs into the classroom]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|One minute thirty seven seconds later... ''[SpongeBob walks up crying]''}}
{{L|Patrick|How'd you do, winner? ''[SpongeBob's crying continues]'' Let's see that license.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I didn't get a license, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Are they gonna mail it to you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.}}
{{L|Patrick|No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's just go home, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[hanging onto Patrick's pants]'' No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. ''[Patrick's pants rip off]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick. No!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[Patrick walks up to the boat she is sitting in and gets in it, in his underwear]'' Good morning.}}
{{L|Patrick|You're not the judge of me!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Actually, I am. Let the testing begin! ''[clicks her pen. Scene cuts to SpongeBob, outside the boating school]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob! SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm here for you, buddy.}}
{{L|Patrick|I passed my test!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You got a perfect score?}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, I thought you said it was hard.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Perfect score. ''[eye twitches]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. ''[scene cuts to the license registration building]''}}
{{L|Miss Shell|Stand behind the line, sir.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[smiling]'' How do I look?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sarcastically]'' Like a winner.}}
{{L|Miss Shell|Ready?}}
{{L|Patrick|Ready. ''[banner comes down which says "CONGRATULATIONS" on it. Balloons and confetti fall]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh?}}
{{L|Fish|Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test.}}
{{L|Patrick|Does that mean I get a free key chain?}}
{{L|Fish|Uhh, no.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh.}}
{{L|Fish|You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.}}''[Patrick runs up to the new boatmobile as SpongeBob's jaw drops]''
{{L|Patrick|Yeah! All right!}}
{{L|Fish|Women will want you. ''[all sigh]'' Men will want to be you. ''[all faint]'' You'll be the envy of your friends. ''[SpongeBob growling angrily]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm so happy for you... ''["La Cucaracha" horn blows in his face]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|Patrick|The horn works. ''[scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road]'' Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.}}
{{L|Patrick|Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Two millionth?}}
{{L|Patrick|Then you can get a free boat just like me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, just like you.}}
{{L|Patrick|I try to serve as an inspiration to others.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Can we go home now? ''[zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over]'' We've been driving around your house for hours.}}
{{L|Patrick|I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks for the ride, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. ''[shudders then drives off. SpongeBob imitates Patrick. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in bed asleep. His clock turns to 3:00am when an engine revving is heard which sends SpongeBob into his diving board then back into his bed]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, what are you doing?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. ''[SpongeBob groans and slams his window shut, breaking it, before going back to bed. Scene cuts to 4:00am]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|4:00? ''[yawns. Doorbell rings]'' Who could be at the door at this hou— ''[falls down the stairs. Opens the door]'' Now what is it, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|You will never guess what happen to me today.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You got your license.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah! ''[shows his license]'' But that's not all.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You got a new boat.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. ''[walks off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gets back into bed]'' Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. ''[foghorn alarm blows]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. ''[scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work]'' I'm so tired. ''[horn honks]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. ''[tries to take a step, but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks for the ride.}}
{{L|Patrick|No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. ''[SpongeBob is getting very angry]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|When did we get a drive-thru?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I used to have a dream.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[through headphones]'' Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— ''["La Cucaracha" horn honks]''}}
{{L|Patrick|The horn still works. ''[scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform]'' Hey, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's with the helmet, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. ''[clicks tongue]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh-huh. ''[scene cuts to Patrick driving]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Boy, driving is so easy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh?}}
{{L|Patrick|Do you want me to give you lessons?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sarcastic]'' Oh, that would be great.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh! ''[drives over to SpongeBob's parents]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.}}
{{L|Mr. SquarePants|Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you? We're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours.}}
{{L|Patrick|What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.}}
{{L|Mrs. SquarePants|That's great, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.}}
{{L|Mrs. SquarePants|Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mom!}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey! ''[Patrick drives off]''}}
{{L|Mr. SquarePants|Even Patrick has a license. ''[both parents sigh]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Let's see what this baby can do. ''[steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH']''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, yeah.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[reads the speedometer]'' 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. ''[car stops next to a policeman]''}}
{{L|Patrick|What? Where? Who?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?}}
{{L|Officer|Umm... okay. ''[uses radar gun. It reads 0mph]'' Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. ''[drives off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you sure you don't want to run him in? ''[scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red]'' It's a red light, Patrick! ''[Patrick runs through red lights]'' Patrick, you just ran three red lights!}}
{{L|Patrick|So?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're suppose to stop!}}
{{L|Patrick|I think the driving genius knows what he's doing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[finally snaps]'' Driving genius?! Would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!}}
{{L|Patrick|They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!}}
{{L|Patrick|How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! ''[takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face--literally--which makes muffled noises]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[fixes his face and then gives Patrick's license out of his hand]'' Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! ''[tears up Patrick's license then laughs. The pieces of the license fly into the cop's hands.]''}}
{{L|Officer|Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. ''[drives off after SpongeBob & Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob & Patrick|It's the police!}}
{{L|Officer|''[over speaker]'' Pull it over, litterbug!}}
{{L|Patrick|Litterbug?! No! ''[drives faster]''}}
{{L|Officer|Ooh, I got me a runner. ''[a bunch of police cars are following him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, what do you think you're doing?}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. ''[drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom]''}}
{{L|Judge|90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.}}
{{L|Patrick|So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! ''[runs up to the judge]'' Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.}}
{{L|Judge|Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! ''[a smiling SpongeBob is put in jail]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|One debt to society later... ''[door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob! ''[both hug]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. ''[shows him a license plate that reads "PALS 4 EVER"]'' Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Patrick|It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, then what do we do with this? ''[Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind]''}}
{{L|Patrick|How's that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah!}}
{{L|Patrick|Ready, buddy?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ready, pal. ''[hops on Patrick's shoulders and makes car noises]'' Woo! Woo!}}
