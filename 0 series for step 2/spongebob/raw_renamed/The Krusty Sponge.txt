{{L|Squidward|Okay, would you like any fries with that?}}
{{L|Customer #1|Uh, ''[turns around to the other customers]'' Hey, if I get some kelp fries, would you guys share them with me?}}
{{L|Jimmy|Do we know you?}}
{{L|Customer #1|''[turns back to Squidward]'' Two orders of kelp fries, please.}}
{{L|Squidward|And two orders of—}}
{{L|Customer #1|I only said one order.}}
{{L|Squidward|But you said "two."}}
{{L|Customer #1|Okay, I'll have two.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[takes out a ticket for the customers' order]'' SpongeBob, order up. ''[all the tickets are stuck in the window, he sighs]'' Welcome to The Krusty— ''[all the tickets get shot out and Squidward walks in the kitchen]'' SpongeBob, what in Neptune's... ''[sees that SpongeBob's body can't move]'' SpongeBob? ''[pushes him back and forth and hat tips over. touches spatula]'' Well, his spatula's still warm. ''[pokes his eye]'' Well, SpongeBob. I must admit this is strange behavior, even for you.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[shows up in the kitchen]'' Ahoy, Squidward. ''[sees SpongeBob]'' Good Neptune, SpongeBob. What has gotten into to you, son?}}
{{L|Squidward|I think he's in some kind of self-induced trance.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No, Squidward. This is worse. he's got the thousand-yard stare. I had it once meself back in me service days. ''[shakes SpongeBob]'' What is it, lad? Quick, we're losing money! ''[SpongeBob's hat falls off and Mr. Krabs picks up what's in it]'' It's the boy's tiny calendar. And he has circled today's date. ''[reads the date on the 23rd]'' "Important Food Critic visits Krusty Krab?!"}}
{{L|Squidward|That's what's causing all this? Only a complete moron would worry about what some critic has to say. ''[both Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are quivering]'' I rest my case. ''[the doors get pushed away and a fish version of Gene Shalit named "Gene Scallop" enters and sniffs the air in the restaurant]'' Hey, in or out, mister? You're letting out the A.C. ''[the fish stares at Squidward]'' Weirdo.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Why, hello! You're the television food critic Gene Scallop, aren't ya? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Eugene Krabs, owner and proprietor of this fine... ''[Gene Scallop walks away and up to Squidward]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, do you want to order something or do you just want to block my reading light?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Squidward, you just drove away Gene Scallop! Don't you know our lives depend on his review?}}
{{L|Squidward|Mr. Krabs, the only thing my life depends on is going home at 6:00. ''[Mr. Krabs walks over to Gene Scallop]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|M— Mr. Scallop, wait, please! Before you go, come on, sit down. Try one of our delicious Krabby Patties. It's absolutely— ''[spits while trying to say "free"]'' Complimentary. ''[cut to SpongeBob squirting mustard on Mr. Scallop's patty, then putting the bun on]'' Okay, SpongeBob, that'll be all. ''[SpongeBob lifts up his hat, then puts it back down and leaves]'' He's nobody. ''[Gene takes the Krabby Patty and takes one bite, then leaves without saying a word]'' We're doomed! ''[cut to news on the TV as cats meow]''}}
{{L|Barbara|And there were no survivors.}}
{{L|Bob|Thank you, Barbara.}}
{{L|Barbara|Thank you, Bob.}}
{{L|Squidward|She is so tacky.}}
{{L|Bob|And now it's time for "Bottom Feeding" with Gene Scallop.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Turn it up, Squidward. ''[Squidward turns it up]''}}
{{L|Gene Scallop|Thank you, Bob. This week, I visited--}}
{{L|Bob|You're welcome, Gene.}}
{{L|Gene Scallop|''[clears throat and moves his glasses]'' This week, I reviewed The Krusty Krab restaurant, a local burger joint that's second to none; or should I say second to "run," since this critic wanted to make like a banana and peel out the minute he saw how drab this Krab really was.}}
{{L|Barbara|That bad, huh, Gene?}}
{{L|Gene Scallop|Barbara, once I stuck my beak through that door, my appetite flew South for the winter. I mean, I'm not "kidding" when I say this restaurant smells like the rear-end of a goat. ''[customers smell the aroma, and a gas noise is heard]''}}
{{L|Bob|And how was the service, Gene?}}
{{L|Gene Scallop|You could find livelier help in a graveyard and I'm not just "coffin." ''[two customers are whispering to each other]'' The management stunk so bad, I had to get my sweater dry cleaned on the way home... with me ''in'' it. ''[customers start mumbling and walking out]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, no, wait! Wait!}}
{{L|Gene Scallop|''[too close to Barbara and Bob]'' However, at the end of my visit, I chowed down on a meal that titillated my taste buds and gratified my gullet. That sponge behind the grill is no square when it comes to cooking. ''[excited talking as the customers rush to sit down at their tables for some food]'' If Krabs really wanted to soak up the dough, he'd sponge it up, he'd sponge it out, he'd over-sponge it. You can never have too much sponge. ''[Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, back to work.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' That's me boy, SpongeBob! That's me boy. ''[SpongeBob walks in the kitchen as a dollar sign while register rings keep sounding. Cut to a line of fish lined up at The Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|La, la, la, la, la, la, la! Wow. ''[Mr. Krabs is working on putting a new sign called "The Krusty Sponge"]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Okay, a little lower, lower— that's perfect!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good morning, sir. What's with the new sign?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, just making a few cosmetic changes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, you mean like when Squidward had that mole taken of his—}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[cuts him off before he could finish]'' Umm— yeah, a little bit like that. ''[cut to inside of the Krusty Sponge where SpongeBob walks past Squidward, dressed in a SpongeBob costume with a sign behind saying "As Seen on TV"]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Morning, Squidward! ''[oblivious to the costume]'' Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes? ''[Squidward hisses at SpongeBob who runs away]''}}
{{L|Tyler|Look, it's him! ''[walks up to Squidward]'' Mr. SquarePants, can I have your autograph?}}
{{L|Squidward|No.}}
{{L|Tyler|But, why?}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, the first reason is, I have no use of my arms. See? ''[shakes his arms, but accidentally hits Tyler]''}}
{{L|Tyler|Ow! ''[Mr. Krabs runs between them.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, what's going on over here?}}
{{L|Tyler|He hit me, just as I wanted his autograph!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Angry]'' Squidward! I'm sorry, little girl. Of course you can have his autograph— for five bucks.}}
{{L|Tyler|What a rip! ''[walks away. Grumbles madly, goes to a table]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Look at these, Squidward! ''[holds up napkins that have SpongeBob's face on them]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Looks like some horrific shroud.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|They're our new Krusty Sponge napkins! Extra absorbent. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Squidward|You really need to see a doctor.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, that reminds me, Squidward. I need you to unpack these boxes. ''[points to a stack of boxes that say "KK" on them]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What's in them?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[takes out two bottles that have SpongeBob's face as a label and red nozzles]'' Condiments. We got "Tangy Spongy Sauce" and "Mild Bobby Sauce" for the not-so-daring.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, clever. ''[SpongeBob runs up to Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Captain! My spatula's missing, sir!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I got it right here. Here you go, Squidward. ''[sticks it into the costume's forehead]'' You're on grill duty now.}}
{{L|Squidward|But that's SpongeBob's job!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Don't worry, Squidward. I got something else lined up for him. ''[cut to SpongeBob as the engineer in the train that is going around The Krusty Krab]'' Step right up, folks! Take a ride on The Krusty Sponge Fun Train! Tickets are only $1.98. Seat belts not included. ''[everyone cheers. Cut to the kitchen, where Squidward is looking at the spatula that is on the grill]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Okay, how am I going to do this now? Umm— ''[grunts while trying to get the spatula. Hits it with one of the costume arms and hits himself in the forehead, sending him back into pots and pans]'' Mommy, is that you? ''[outside, SpongeBob is tired of pedaling the train]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, I really think I should be getting back to the grill now.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Are you kidding, lad? Just look at these paying customers! ''[uses the megaphone]'' Who's ready for another lap? ''[everyone cheers]'' Keep on truckin', SpongeBob. I've got some important business to see to in me office. ''[cut to Squidward, still in the SpongeBob costume, entering Mr. Krabs' office]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Mr. Krabs? Uh, this is a bad time, isn't it? ''[Mr. Krabs is bathing in his money]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Nervously]'' No!}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, there are some men out back with a delivery and want you to sign.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Still nervous]'' Okay, tell them I'll be right out.}}
{{L|Squidward|Got it. ''[as he turns around, he hits his head on the top of the door entrance]'' Ow! ''[mutters]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And let's watch the language, Squidward! ''[cut to Mr. Krabs signing for the packages]''}}
{{L|Joe|Just sign here, here and here.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|My pleasure.}}
{{L|Squidward|What the heck is all this stuff?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm glad you asked. We got SpongeBob drinking straws— ''[shows a green straw with SpongeBob in the middle]'' coasters— ''[holds up two coasters with SpongeBob's face on them]'' bibs— ''[holds up a bib with SpongeBob's face on it that says "I soiled myself at The Krusty Sponge"]'' and me personal favorite, SpongeBob ice cubes! ''[shows them, but they melt away]'' Aww.}}
{{L|Squidward|Mr. Krabs, don't you think you might be taking all this a little bit too far?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Showing signs of delusion]'' Get back to work, SpongeBob! I'll be in me SpongeBob if you SpongeBob me. ''[walks away crazily as Squidward is not surprised. Cut to Squidward flipping a patty and laughing at his success]'' Whoops! ''[sets three boxes down on the floor]'' There you go, Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|Now what?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, you're going to love this. Spongy Patties! ''[shows a yellow patty with green holes]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Spongy Patties?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah. I want you to start using them instead of the other ones. ''[tosses one on the grill]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Where'd you get them?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|They were just the boxes of patties we didn't have room for in the freezer. They turned yellow. Got to keep those SpongeBob ice cubes somewhere, you know.''[he chuckles]''}}
{{L|Squidward|You mean to tell me you actually expect people to pay $1.98 for a rotten patty?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Squidward, you're right! All this instant success must be scrambling my brains! We'll make them $2.98! ''[shuts the kitchen door. Cut to SpongeBob blowing the whistle on the Fun Train, but he’s really tired]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|All aboard...}}
{{L|Nat|Hey, we didn't pay $3.00 to watch you take a nap!}}
{{L|Sadie|That's the worst SpongeBob costume I've ever seen! ''[all the passengers chant]'' Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride! ''[SpongeBob sneaks away and takes the statue of himself, where Billy is going to get a picture by a camera by Harold, and puts it in his seat of the Fun Train, then squeezes through the doors of the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, boy. What a day. What's next? A zombie invasion? ''[screams seeing after Buddy, Bill, Tina, Sadie, Sandals and Frank with yellow skin and green spots similar to SpongeBob's holes walking around like zombies]'' Mr. Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uh, go away, please, I'm busy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies! ''[screams as the zombies walk towards him]'' Open up, open up, open up! ''[bangs on the door hard enough to where it collapses on the floor]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Who? ''[Mr. Krabs is dressed in a nice shirt with a pile of money in the chair across from him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob— ''[sees the zombies and gasps]'' Great Neptune's mother's stockings! Zombies— they're here to eat me money! ''[tries to run back into his office, but SpongeBob grabs him and turns him around]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers— look! ''[two fish are sitting at the table. One is yellow with green spots and the other one is normal-looking]''}}
{{L|Sandals|''[groans]'' I ate this yellow Krabby Patty and now I feel sick.}}
{{L|Bailiff|Krabby Patty? ''[takes a bite and spits it out, disgusted. He then glares at the worried Mr. Krabs before he walks up to him ]'' Man, you've got some serious problems. If you're trying to pass that off as a Krabby Patty—}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Nervously]'' It's a... It's a Spongy Patty! ''[Bailiff turns yellow with green spots]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, what have you done?! You've poisoned all these people!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Shocked and guilty]'' No! But... I just... just... I can explain, I... ''[Mr. Krabs looks down at his wrists because they are in handcuffs]'' What the...?}}
{{L|Bailiff|''[shows his police badge]'' Tell it to the judge, Krabs. ''[cut to the courtroom]''}}
{{L|Guard|Calling the courtroom to attention in the case "People of Bikini Bottom vs. Mr. Krabs." The honorable Judge Horace A. Whopper presiding.}}
{{L|Judge Horace A. Whopper|''[clears throat]'' Has the jury reached a verdict? ''[jury is all yellow with green spots. Gene Scallop stands up and is yellow with green spots as well]''}}
{{L|Gene Scallop|''[along with the others]'' We have, your honor. We the jury find the defendant, Eugene H. Krabs, guilty of all charges.}}
{{L|Judge Horace A. Whopper|Very well. Does the defendant have anything to say before we send him down the river?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sadly]'' No, your honor.}}
{{L|Judge Horace A. Whopper|Very well. ''[bangs the SpongeBob gavel down. When he does, it laughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Eh, hang on a second there, judge! That wouldn't happen to be a SpongeBob gavel you're using?}}
{{L|Judge Horace A. Whopper|Oh, why, yes. It's my prized possession. I am a huge SpongeBob fan.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Permission to approach the bench, your honor! ''[cut to a patty being flipped on the grill]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure is glad to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It's good to have you back, boy. Let's see how Squidward's enjoying his new position. ''[outside, Squidward, still in the SpongeBob costume, is giving the judge a ride on the Fun Train. The judge has a whip in his hand]'' Take him around as many times as you like.}}
{{L|Judge Horace A. Whopper|I just might have to take you up on that. ''[winks and cracks his whip so Squidward goes faster]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sighs]'' I love a happy ending. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[screen goes blank as the whip cracks at the background]''}}
