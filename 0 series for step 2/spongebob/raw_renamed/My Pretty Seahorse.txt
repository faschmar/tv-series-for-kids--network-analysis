{{L|French Narrator|Ah, springtime in Bikini Bottom. All sea creatures have an innate sense of the seasonal changes... ''[Patrick jumps out of his rock with a purple sweater on]'' ...like the starfish. A quick survey of his environment... ''[scratches his back]'' ...and he knows that.}}
{{L|Patrick|It's spring!}}
{{L|French Narrator|The starfish then sheds his winter coat ''[takes his sweater off]'' and stores it away safe for winter. ''[buries the sweater in the sand]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[walks outside and smells the air]'' I'd better call the doctor, 'cause I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers. ''[sniffs them into his nose]'' Hello, Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?}}
{{L|Squidward|Huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Have you said hello to the flowers yet?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[scoffs]'' Good morning, flowers. ''[flowers hiss at him like snakes. Squidward screams and runs inside]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers. ''[SpongeBob digs a hole and puts the flower in it]'' You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty. ''[turns around and grabs his container. When he turns back around, the flower is half eaten. He plants a new flower. When he turns around and grabs the container of water, he sees the flower is eaten again]'' Huh? ''[plants a new one]'' I'm not taking my eyes off you. ''[eyes stretch out staring at the flower]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Three days later...}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob is still staring, but his eyes have shriveled up. He uses the water to make his eyes normal]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[running by]'' Hey, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[turns around]'' Hi, Patrick! ''[when SpongeBob turns back around, the flower is eaten again]'' How does this keep happening? ''[notices a seahorse eating the flower next to him]'' Hi. ''[horse neighs then gallops onto a rock]'' She's beautiful! Wow! ''[imagines riding the seahorse with a head full of wavy hair]'' What a magnificent seahorse. I shall tame her. Who knows what we can accomplish? ''[scene cuts to seahorse eating some flowers and SpongeBob looking at her from a distance writing in a book]'' Because of her mysterious behavior, I have decided to name her Mystery. Hmm, now that I think of it, she is very graceful and majestic. Perhaps I should name her Grace, or Majesty, or Debbie. ''[seahorse neighs]'' She must have spotted my floral bookmark! ''[using a flower bookmark in his book. Mystery gallops over slowly]'' She's coming this way. That's it, girl. Don't be afraid. I'm just a talking sponge, is all. ''[Mystery sniffs the bookmark and then eats it. Scene cuts to SpongeBob riding with Mystery, blowing a bubble heart, posting for Mystery, making stamp books, and walking out of a store laughing with hats. Scene cuts to nighttime in SpongeBob's bed where SpongeBob is sleeping on the floor and Mystery is in SpongeBob's bed]'' Gosh, Mystery, that was the greatest day of my life. Do you think we'll be friends forever? ''[Mystery is asleep]'' I'll take that as a yes!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[it's now morning on the 3rd day as Squidward rides his bike. SpongeBob and Mystery gallop by him]'' What the...?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Squidward! Still riding a machine, I see!}}
{{L|Squidward|Don't say anything, Squidward, remember your karma. ''[his bike trips on something and he falls off a cliff, then explodes. He groans. SpongeBob arrives at the Krusty Krab and ties Mystery to a bike rack]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa, girl. Now you wait out here until I'm done with work. See you at the end of my shift. ''[walks in as Scooter and Wobbles walk by]''}}
{{L|Scooter|Hey, look, Mr. Krabs put in a kiddy ride!}}
{{L|Wobbles|Why doncha try it out? ''[Scooter gets out a quarter]''}}
{{L|Scooter|I can't find the coin slot. Here it is! ''[Scooter finds the "coin slot", but Mystery bucks Scooter into the background and he explodes]''}}
{{L|Wobbles|''[runs off; screams; still in Southern drawl]'' Help! Kiddy ride on the loose!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[walks out]'' What's with all the ruckus? ''[gasps and points at Mystery as she stands innocently idle]'' A monster scaring away me customers!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's not a monster, Mr. Krabs, it's a horse. She's my friend. Her name is Mystery.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You're a mystery, SpongeBob. ''[SpongeBob laughs]'' Get rid of it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[stops laughing]'' Huh? Please, Mr. Krabs, let her stay! She won't hurt nobody nohow!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It's either you or Mystery.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I knew I should've named her Debbie. ''[scene cuts to SpongeBob, sadly grilling up some patties in the kitchen]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, thanks for finally getting rid of that horse!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in a sad voice]'' You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now, if we could just get rid of Squidward. ''[laughs then walks out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good one, sir. ''[takes his pair of sad eyes contacts off]'' Ha! It worked, girl! ''[opens the cabinet with Mystery inside it]'' I'll just keep you here until Patrick finishes that stable I asked him to build. ''[scene cuts to Patrick sitting down with a board on his forehead, doing absolutely nothing]'' Only eight more hours. ''[closes cupboards]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Twelve seconds later... ''[Mystery peeks out of the cupboard]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Mystery, you can't come out yet. If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job. ''[gives her a tray with a patty on it]'' Wait a sec. I bet you're hungry. How 'bout some lunch? ''[Mystery eats the patty and neighs]'' Shhh! Girl, you got to be quiet or...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! ''[SpongeBob closes the cabinet quickly as Mr. Krabs comes bursting in]'' What was that? Is that horse in here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Mr. Krabs. I was just doing my imitation of Mystery. Weesnaw.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, keep working on it! That was terrible! ''[walks out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That was close. ''[gets a tray with three patties]'' From now on, no more hijinks. Order up! ''[puts the tray on the window. Mystery eats it. Squidward walks up to the window]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Huh? SpongeBob, where's my order?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Did you look under the tray?}}
{{L|Squidward|No I didn't, sorry. ''[looks under the tray then sighs]'' SpongeBob, could you just get my order?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|They vanished. ''[starts trembling]'' Squidward, do you think the Krusty Krab is haunted? What if they come for me next? ''[bites his fingernails in fear]'' I gotta get out of here! ''[runs to the door but Squidward intervenes]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, there's no ghosts!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Mystery approaches a customer's Krabby Patty]'' In case you've forgotten, here's how things work. I order the food, ''[SpongeBob notices Mystery]'' you cook the food, then the customer gets the food. ''[SpongeBob's eyes move to the side of his face. Squidward is still talking]'' We do that for 40 years and then we die. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, what do you say? ''[Mystery eats a Krabby Patty and she burps]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward. I'll be right back. ''[grabs Mystery and shoves her under a cupboard]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What's that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't tell Mr. Krabs! I got it all under control! ''[closes the cupboard]'' Now then, you were saying?}}
{{L|Squidward|Just get my order. ''[walks out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You got it, Squidward? ''[chuckles]'' Ghosts. ''[Mystery eats SpongeBob's Krusty Krab work hat]'' Mystery, you ate my hat! ''[Mystery belches out a chewed spatula as SpongeBob gasps]'' Mystery, you ate my spatula! ''[approaches empty Krabby Patty boxes]'' You ate all the Krabby Patties! ''[approaches the half-eaten stove]'' You ate the stove! ''[approaches an empty wheelchair]'' You ate Old Man Jenkins!}}
{{L|Old Man Jenkins|''[from inside Mystery's belly]'' I don't want to be a burden.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[customers yelling for complaints]'' Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen. }}
{{L|Thaddeus|Where's our food?}}
{{L|Fred|I'm so hungry!}}
{{L|Tina|This is my only lunch hour!}}
{{L|Tom|Where's Old Man Jenkins?}}
{{L|Squidward|Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Squidward, what's going on in here?}}
{{L|Squidward|Why don't you go ask CowBob RanchPants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[runs into the kitchen]'' SpongeBob, what's the meaning of all these nicknames? ''[his eyes bulge in shock]'' Davy H. Jones! ''[SpongeBob is by Mystery's side, who has eaten too much]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mystery got a belly-ache from eating Krabby Patties, so I made her a bicarbonate of soda. ''[Mystery belches out Old Man Jenkins]''}}
{{L|Old Man Jenkins|What did I miss? ''[Mr. Krabs takes out his eyes, blows on them, rubs them, and puts them back on]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So, my eyes are correct! You still have that horse even after I ordered you to get rid of it! Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Mr. Krabs! Don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend! ''[Mystery licks SpongeBob's cheek. Squidward sobs because of a bowl of onions near him]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey, who left this bowl of onions here?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sniffles]'' You do?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I was 5 years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sniffles]'' And one day at the beach, it was so hot and I was so thirsty! I spent it on a soda! ''[sobbing]'' My best friend! ''[crying]'' ''[Squidward sobs some more because of the onions again]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What? Would you get out of here?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|The point is, son, sometimes, you have to set things free even though it's hard. ''[points to Mystery]'' Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse. ''[two customers spit out their patties]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand.}}
{{L|Nat Peterson|''[sobbing because of the bowl of onions Squidward is holding under his nose]'' Hey! }}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, girl, you're free to go. ''[takes Mystery outside and takes Mystery's leash off]'' I can't keep you anymore. ''[cries]'' I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild. ''[Mystery gallops away]'' Well, what are you waiting for? Can't you see I don't want you anymore? ''[now begins bawling harder by a huge shot, as Patrick walks up with the board on his head]'' Just get out of here, you stupid, dumb animal! ''[resumes wailing intensely, Patrick walks away as Mr. Krabs walks up to SpongeBob]'' Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It's okay, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey, Mr. Krabs, looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad! ''[vault of money opens to show dollar bills that have been eaten and a bunch of money is missing]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[yelling]'' Get that horse! ''[he and SpongeBob run after Mystery]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Mystery!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Come back!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mystery! Weesnaw!}}
{{L|Both|Mystery, come back here!}}
{{L|''[The scene cuts to Patrick, who still has the board attached to his head, trying to enter a hat shop, but the board keeps bumping on the sides of the entrance repeatedly as the screen fades to black, ending the episode]''}}
