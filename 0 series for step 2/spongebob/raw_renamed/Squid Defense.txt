{{L|''[The episode starts with Squidward walking out of the bathroom holding a newspaper]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hiii... yah! ''[karate chops Squidward in the stomach]'' Squidward! Sorry, buddy, didn't see you. Are you okay?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[holding his leg in pain; moans]'' What kind of unforeseen yet completely predictable stupidity have you ruined my day with this time?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I'm just practicing my ''[chops with his hand]'' karate chops. I'm going to have ''[takes off his karate glove]'' an intense karate session with Sandy later. Sandy says you never know what creepy creeper could be creeping creepingly around any creepy corner.}}
{{L|Squidward|Paranoid much?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[spooked]'' Hiyah! ''[chops Squidward in the torso again]'' Sorry, Squidward! I thought you were one of those creepy creepers. You know, Squidward, you really should know how to protect yourself. Maybe you'd like to join us.}}
{{L|Squidward|Well... no. I have more important things to do.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okey dokey, Squidward! Stop on by later if you change your mind about the karate.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[pushes SpongeBob]'' I won't. ''[walks out of the Krusty Krab and scene changes to him walking in town with groceries. He then walks down a dark alley then turns around noticing something]'' Uh... hello? Is somebody there? ''[spots a large figure in the distance]'' Um... hello? It's considered rude not to answer! ''[the figure walks closer to him. He starts to act nervous]'' Hah... whatta ya got? Cotton in your ear holes? ''[laughs nervously as the figure gets even closer to him]'' I gotta get outta here! ''[starts to run away, walks face-first into a low ladder, then falls on the ground and drops the groceries, then notices the figure staring at him, gets up and runs to SpongeBob's house]'' SpongeBob! ''[starts banging on his door as the scene changes over to SpongeBob and Gary]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[watching television with Gary while laughing]'' Oh, wait, I don't get it.}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob! SpongeBob! Open up! ''[the door opens and he falls on his face]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|Hurry, SpongeBob! ''[pushes SpongeBob inside and closes the door]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward? What's wrong?}}
{{L|Squidward|You were rrrright!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I was? About what?}}
{{L|Squidward|About the danger that lurks around every corner! ''[screams as a shadow roars at him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um, Squidward? ''[Gary is shown]'' It's just Gary.}}
{{L|Gary|''[looking at the television]'' Meow meow meow meow meow!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, I should've named you "Scary," eh buddy?}}
{{L|Gary|''[laughs]'' Meow meow meow meow! ''[crawls away]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, this is serious! I was just viciously attacked!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' No!}}
{{L|Squidward|You gotta teach me, SpongeBob! Teach me the way! The way of tarake.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Eh, don't you mean "karate?"}}
{{L|Squidward|Um... sure. Whatever.}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to Squidward and SpongeBob who is in his karate gear]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[walking around Squidward]'' Hmm... hmm! Hmm... yes! You show potential young student! ''[grabs Squidward's arm]'' But with the rubbery arms and the doughiness in this area ''[pokes Squidward's belly]'' you obviously have our work cut out for us.}}
{{L|Squidward|Can't we just get on with this SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|See see ba ba!}}
{{L|Squidward|Sigh... I mean can't get just get on with this "O Great Sensei?"}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Play close attention and you will receive the totality of my karate mastery! Handed down from Sensei Cheeks herself. Now watch! Watch and learn. ''[walks over to a piece of wood and karate chops it the force breaks him in half]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Uh huh. What else you got?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's it.}}
{{L|Squidward|That's it!? THAT'S the "totality" of your karate mastery?}}
{{L|SpongeBob Half 1|Well, Squidward. I've only been studying a couple of years. But if total karate knowledge is what you seek...}}
{{L|SpongeBob Half 2|...then you should visit Sensei Cheeks.}}
{{L|SpongeBob Half 1|Hey! I was just going to say that!}}
{{L|SpongeBob Half 2|I know! ''[both laugh]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh boy...}}
{{L|''[karate chop transition to Sandy's Treedome]''}}
{{L|Sandy|I don't know, SpongeBob. ''[grabs Squidward's arm]'' With the rubbery arms and doughiness in this area ''[pokes Squidward's belly]'', we obviously-}}
{{L|Squidward|-Alright already! We've been through this! Are you going to teach me how to get revenge on my attacker or what!?}}
{{L|Sandy|Whoa, oh, oh! Karate ain't for revenge. It's a delicate art that helps you protect yourself!}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah, fine.}}
{{L|Sandy|Great! Now repeat after me: HIYAH!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|HIYAH! ''[also karate chops]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh...whatever. Hiyah...}}
{{L|Sandy|"I promise to use karate only for protection and not for revenge."}}
{{L|Squidward|"I promise to use karate only for protection and not for revenge." Or whatever...}}
{{L|''[karate chop transition to SpongeBob, Sandy, and Squidward near a wooden board]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Okay then! Let's get started with a little choppin'! Like so. Hiyah! ''[karate chops the board in half, and SpongeBob does the same]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa!}}
{{L|Squidward|A board? I wasn't attacked by a piece of wood! I was assaulted by a deranged lunatic!}}
{{L|Sandy|The only way to protect yourself is if you know the basics. Now give it a chop!}}
{{L|Squidward|Sigh...whatever you say, Sensei...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This is a tough one, Squidward. Don't feel bad if you can't do it.}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm sure I can break one little twig! Hiiii-YAH! ''[karate chops the board but it doesn't break. the force makes him shake and moves back on the treedome wall and he breaks apart on the ground]''}}
{{L|''[karate chop transition to Sandy]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Arms up Squidward! Block! Block! ''[Squidward gets hit by acorns thrown by SpongeBob]'' Block! Block!}}
{{L|Squidward|Arg! This is stupid! The only thing this maniac threw at me were his big, meaty fists! ''[raises his hands up but SpongeBob continues to throw acorns at him. Then he throws a acorn at SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[blocks the acorn with his elbow]'' Block!}}
{{L|Sandy|Now that's how you do it!}}
{{L|Squidward|Dimwits luck! ''[gets hit by another acorn]''}}
{{L|''[karate chop transition to the tree of them near a sandbag]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on, Squiddy! Give it the ol' roundhouse!}}
{{L|Squidward|Alright... ''[moves backwards]'' Hiyah! ''[kicks the sandbag but gets stuck to it and starts to get smacked over and over and is thrown in front of Sandy]'' This isn't working! ''[walks back toward the sandbag]'' My assailant was twice as tall! And shoulders were twenty times as broad! The burrows of his brow with the size as biceps!}}
{{L|Sandy|Hmm... we're gotta make this more personal for you Squidward. So is to help you bring out your inner dragon! SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[jumps in wearing a ski mask]'' Hey! Grocery boy! It is me! A big, scary miscreant! Now hand over that sack of groceries before things get ugly!}}
{{L|Squidward|Groceries? You'll have to pull my groceries from my cold, wet tentacles bucko! Take this! Hiyah! ''[tries to karate chop SpongeBob but his arm gets stuck to his helmet]'' Huh? Think that's going to stop me!? You're not getting me without a fight! HIYAH! ''[tries to kick SpongeBob but his feet retract and get stuck to his helmet as well. He starts moving around on the ground getting more and more tangled]'' Got you... right where...I want you! ''[moves around again becoming fully tangled]'' Vengeance... is... MINE!}}
{{L|Sandy|Vengeance? Squidward Tentacles, I told ya at the beginning that karate ain't for revenge! Sorry Squidward. As of now, I ain't your sensei no more! ''[walks off]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Sandy! Wait! ''[tries to move]'' I need you to teach... ''[sighs]''... this is pointless. ''[struggles]'' I'll never be able to protect myself. ''[struggles]'' I may as well start handing my groceries to criminals. Here! Please Mr. Criminal! ''[struggles]'' Take my unprocessed kale cream.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sandy! Wait! Please! Help him! He just want to keep his organic, blue algae safe.}}
{{L|Sandy|He's going to use my teachings for revenge, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Squidward|Please, Sandy! I'll do anything!}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh, really? Well, Squidward, a wise sensei once told me: ''[takes out a mop]'' "One must first know the movements of everyday, to master ka-rah-tay!}}
{{L|''[karate chop transition to a short montage with Squidward first mopping in Sandy's house. He then tries to turn on a vacuum but doesn't turn on. He kicks it and it finally turns on and starts to clean up making the place spotless]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Phew! All finished!}}
{{L|Sandy|Wow! It looks great!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[to Squidward]'' Psst! You missed a spot!}}
{{L|''[Squidward growls and a karate transition to him with water hoses tied to him spraying the grass]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Alright! I reckon that yard is good and watered!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Psst! You missed a spot!}}
{{L|''[Squidward mumbles angrily as a karate chop transition to him shoveling the ground]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Shut up! Phew! ''[grabs the bucket of acorns and pours them into the hole he dug up]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Atta boy Squiddy! ''[on a beach chair next to SpongeBob]'' Be sure to twist that torso!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey Sandy? ''[stretches]'' I don't remember this being a part of my training.}}
{{L|Sandy|It wasn't! But today is chore day! So I'd figured why not fry two fish in one skillet! ''[she and SpongeBob laugh]''}}
{{L|Squidward|That's it! I am outta here! This is a no good waste of my time! ''[rams his foot onto a bucket of acorns and they start to fly toward him. He blocks them all away]'' Hey! I'm doing it! I'm blocking the acorns!}}
{{L|Sandy|Ye-ha! I told y'all had to do is know the movements of everyday to master karate!}}
{{L|Squidward|Hah hah! I can't believe I did it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[holding a wooden board]'' Yeah Yeah! Now try this!}}
{{L|Squidward|Okay! Okay! Hee-YAH! ''[chops the wooden board and SpongeBob in half] ''Hah hah hah! Oh, I did it! ''[starts running then jumps]'' Hee-Yah! ''[kicks the Slug Buddy punching bag destroying it]'' I can protect my groceries now! Hee-YAH! ''[kicks SpongeBob toward the glass wall and breaks him apart. SpongeBob holds a thumbs up]'' I am a karate master! WOO HOO HOO!}}
{{L|Sandy|Well, I wouldn't go that far. But you have proven yourself worthy of... ''[takes out a belt]'' ...the Belt of Basic Competence!}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah yeah, that's great, thanks. But I have some business to attend to! ''[walks off and a karate chop transition to him walking down a dark alley]'' Heh heh heh... What's this? Do I find myself on this dark and scary street, yet again? We'll just see what happens! ''[walks down further into the alley]'' This time!}}
{{L|Man|Hey! You! ''[starts walking toward Squidward]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Let me give him a taste! A mere morsel of what's in store! ''[karate chops]'' Hee-YAH! ''[kicks]'' HEE-YAH! ''[flips]'' Hiyah! That one was called Washing Sandy's Windows! ''[the man walks closer]'' Stay back or you're gonna get it! I am warning you! ''[the man continues to walk closer breathing heavily]'' Okay buddy, I warned ya! ''[near a trash can]'' I like to call this one Taking Out Sandy's Trash! Hee-YAH! ''[kicks the trash can toward the man]''}}
{{L|Man|What? ''[gets hit on the head by the trash can]'' Ow!}}
{{L|Squidward|Hah! Hah! How do you like them apples? Yah! ''[punches a crate at the man]''}}
{{L|Man|Ow! OW!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[holding two wooden planks]'' Hah! Feel my wrath! ''[throws them]'' How's your uncle!}}
{{L|Man|''[gets hit on the head by one of the planks]'' Ow! ''[the other hits him on the stomach]'' Ow!}}
{{L|Squidward|My finishing move! I give you Watering Sandy's Lawn! Hee-YAH! ''[spin kicks a dumpster at the man. Then pushes it off of him]''}}
{{L|Man|Oh...hey, man! Wha-what was that for? ''[holding Squidward's groceries]'' I was just trying to give you back your groceries you dropped!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[takes the groceries]'' Uh, oh.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Sandy! I found him! He's over here! ''[holding the belt]'' You forgot your belt silly! ''[looks at the man and gasps]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Gosh! What happened to you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This guy's been... ka-rah-tayed!}}
{{L|Sandy|After all I'd said about never using karate for revenge?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|For shame, Squidward. For shame.}}
{{L|Sandy|Looks like he's not worthy of this belt after all. ''[takes the belt]'' Thanks for dishonoring our trust in you Squidward. ''[walks off with SpongeBob]''.}}
{{L|Squidward|Whatever! I'm still a karate master!}}
{{L|Officer John|Wow, really? You are? ''[walks Squidward to the police car]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Yes I am!}}
{{L|Officer John|Hey watch your head. ''[Squidward gets into the police car. Then John gets into it]'' Oh, I never guess it.}}
{{L|Squidward|And what does that suppose to mean?}}
{{L|Officer John|Oh, uh... nothing. Just with the rubbery arms and the doughiness in the midsection...}}
{{L|Squidward|Okay, already! I get it! ''[notices the handcuffs on him]'' What? Wait a second. Am I under arrest?}}
{{L|Officer John|You sure are! And you have the right to remain silent... ''[Squidward screams loudly]'' ...or not silent. ''[drives off, and the episode ends]''}}
