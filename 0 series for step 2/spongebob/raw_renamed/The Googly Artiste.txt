{{L|''[episode starts with Squidward exiting his house while mummering a tune while pushing a cart with a cloak over an unknown object]''}}
{{L|Squidward|La da de, la da dum, la da doo. La da dee. Ah, it's a great day for the art world. ''[stops walking]'' Famous art critic Fredrick T. Nitpick will be critiquing my latest masterpiece. I love hearing myself talk.}}
{{L|''[hears giggling and laughing. camera pans over to SpongeBob and Patrick clearly with weaved baskets in front of them. Squidward appears to be behind him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, hi, Squid... ''[observes artist hat]'' Whoa! ''[points to hat]'' I love your hat.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[whacks arm away]'' Don't touch it! And it's not a hat. It's a beret.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A beret? Oh, where can I get one?}}
{{L|Squidward|Sorry, SpongeBob. Berets are only worn for true artists, like moi.}}
{{L|Patrick|You're an artist?}}
{{L|Squidward|Yes, I'm an artist! What are you two bubbleheads doing anyway?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're making arts and crafts. I've been learning the fine art of basket weaving. ''[holds up a basket]'' I made this one using designs of me and my best friends. ''[the basket appears to have Squidward, Patrick, and himself weaved on the basket]'' And I also made this cute little scallop house.}}
{{L|''[scallops fly out of scallop house and commute on Squidward's face, only for Squidward to shoo them away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And I made this wallet, ''[pulls out his wallet out of his basket]'' and I crocheted money to go in it. ''[holds up crocheted bills]''}}
{{L|Squidward|So, you've been counterfeiting currency? And what's doorknob number two been up to?}}
{{L|''[camera cuts to Patrick, apparently hitting a weaved basket with a hammer]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[halts hitting the basket with the hammer and laughs]'' I've been making baskets, too. ''[the basket unravels onto the table]'' Darn! This hammer is defective.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Do you want to make crafts, too?}}
{{L|Squidward|Crafts? ''[raspberries]'' This isn't summer camp. I am a true artiste. ''[walks out of scene]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, man. I'll never make art like you and...Squidward! ''[initiates sobbing]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, don't be sad. You can be an artist, too. I'll find something that will tap into your particular artistic skill set. ''[thinking]'' Now let me see. Oh, this'll be perfect! Now, start with a rock... ''[pulls up a rock]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A little glue... ''[applies glue to his rock]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Stick on a couple of googly eyes... ''[applies googly eyes to his rock]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Whoa. Slow down, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And presto: A rock with googly eyes!}}
{{L|Patrick|Whoa. I did not see that coming!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now you try! ''[pulls up glue and a rock]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm scared.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You can do this!}}
{{L|Patrick|I shall make the attempt! ''[grabs glue and starts working on his rock]'' Privacy, please?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, sorry. ''[looks away and shields eyes as Patrick turns away. Patrick makes noises]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I've done it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, let's take a look!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[moves his hands away so SpongeBob can see his rock]'' Behold!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! Oh! Oh, it's beautiful!}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm an artist!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Hooray!}}
{{L|Squidward|Hate.}}
{{L|''[Nitpick shows up]''}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|Why, hello, Mr. Tentacles! I'm Frederick T. Nitpick, world famous art critic! This is your artwork, I presume?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, it certainly is! This piece represents my struggle to reveal my genius to a moronic world. ''[pulls the sheet off the sculpture]'' Witness "La Visti Squidward"! Stunning, isn't it?}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|My considered opinion is "Eww!" I'll have to confiscate your artist beret.}}
{{L|''[Nitpick pulls off Squidward's beret]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What? No! No, you can't do that!}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|Sorry, but I'm looking for a real artist!}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm an artist! Hooray!}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|''[walks away]'' An artist, eh?}}
{{L|Squidward|No, wait, come back!}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|''[walks over to SpongeBob and Patrick]'' Now, which one of you two is the artiste?}}
{{L|''[Squidward runs over]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We both are. It's lots of fun! Would you like to make something, too?}}
{{L|''[Nitpick laughs heavily]''}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|I'm a critic. I don't make things. I judge things. I’m a judger. For instance, I judge your work. ''[looks at SpongeBob's scallop house]'' Lame. ''[walks over to Patrick]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Don't judge me! ''[becomes worried]''}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|''[looks at Patrick's rock with googly eyes]'' Holy guacamole frijoles! It's so, so, primitive and naïve! You're a genius!}}
{{L|Patrick|Is that good?}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|I'll give you 500 bucks for it! And this hat! ''[places Squidward's beret on Patrick's head]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey!}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|''[slaps money in Patrick's hand]'' You are a master artist, my friend. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|Squidward|You can't give that dunderhead the artist hat!}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|Who's the critic here? ''[continues to walk away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! Did you hear that, Squidward? Patrick is an artist!}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, ''[raspberries]'' selling one lousy piece doesn't make you an artist!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How many lousy pieces have you sold, Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, about... um, um, well, I'll bet he never sells another one of those ridiculous trinkets!}}

* ''[a man named Ted walks over to Patrick]''

<br />{{L|Ted|Hey there, I noticed your hat. Are you an artist?}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah!}}
{{L|Ted|Do you have any art? I have a real craving for creativity!}}
{{L|Patrick|Um...okay! ''[picks up a rock and puts googly eyes all over it]'' Art! ''[hands it to the man]''}}
{{L|Ted|Thanks, man! Here's fifty bucks! ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I'll bet he never sells another!}}
{{L|Sally|Hey, Ted! Where'd you get that art?}}
{{L|Ted|From that pink genius over there!}}
{{L|Sally|I want to buy one!}}
{{L|Nat|Me too!}}
{{L|Man|I also!}}
{{L|Squidward|I'll bet.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[presses on Squidward's nose to prevent him from talking]'' Squidward, I think we should have a little talk about your gambling problem. ''[Squidward grunts and removes SpongeBob's hand]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I actually want to go to work today! ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks at his watch]'' Oh! I'm almost late to be early for work! See ya later, Patrick! ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|Patrick|So long, my dear, earnest, yet untalented friend! ''[skips to Patrick selling his googly-eye rocks at a stand in front of his house]'' One for you! And one for you! And one for... ''[looks around and notices there are no more rocks]'' I've run out of rocks to put googly eyes on! I've run out of rocks!}}
{{L|Harold|Got anything else?}}
{{L|Patrick|Um, the artist needs alone time! ''[runs into his rock]''}}
{{L|Harold|He's so eccentric!}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm all out of rocks! What am I going to do now? That was my thing! Oh! ''[goes to get a bucket of paint and splatters it all over a sheet of paper, creating a The Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh]'' Tartar sauce! ''[throws bucket away and gets a big boulder to sculpt from and ends up sculpting The Thinker]'' That stinks, too! ''[his stomach growls]'' The artist needs a lunch break!}}
{{L|''[skips to the Krusty Krab. Patrick opens door to the restaurant]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, not you again! May I take your order?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[looks over his menu]'' Um! Uh! I'm thinking about having a Krabby Patty.}}
{{L|Squidward|One Krabby Patty ''[lifts his hand to press the button on his register, only for Patrick to stop his hand from making any moves]''}}
{{L|Patrick|But I'm wondering if that might be too predictable! ''[Takes his hand off Squidward's]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[rubs his hand]'' Then, what do you want?}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know! I'm not feeling very inspired at the moment!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hiya, Patrick! Ordering up a delicious Krabby Patty?}}
{{L|Patrick|Maybe, I don't know! I'm in a creative slump!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Patrick, that's terrible.}}
{{L|Squidward|Just order already!}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay, I want new ideas to satisfy a public hunger for my goodly goods!}}
{{L|Squidward|Off the menu! Choose something off the menu! We don't serve artistic advice here!}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, then, why is it on the menu?}}
{{L|''[Squidward looks at menu to see "Artistic Advice" written on the menu]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Huh? What?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Get back to work, Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|In case you haven't noticed, ''[takes his hat off his head]'' this is not an artist hat! ''[inhales and exhales]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, you can borrow mine! ''[puts his hat on Squidward's head]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Beautiful. ''[cuts to SpongeBob bringing Patrick to his table]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Make yourself comfortable, Mister Patrick! Our artistic consultant will be right with you!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob brings Squidward to table against his will]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This is Mr. Tentacles. He'll be handling all your artistic advice needs!}}
{{L|Squidward|Mm-hmm!}}
{{L|Patrick|Mm-hmm. Pleasure!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Here's your Krabby Patty! ''[puts his Krabby Patty on the table and holds up his tray]'' Shall I put it on your tab?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, yeah. Keep it open. We might be here all night! Let me just say up front, I'm a fan! I'm excited to learn from a master. My career in self-worth are in your hands! Let us writing on this. Okay... advise!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sighs and gets up]'' Why don't you just concentrate on your patty? ''[leaves]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[looks at his patty]'' Of course, it's so obvious now! How did I not see it earlier? Squidward's a genius! I know now what I must do! ''[reaches in his pocket for googly eyes and puts them on the patty, admiring his masterpiece. Frederick Nitpick pops out of the ketchup bottle]''}}
{{L|Frederick Nitpick|Brilliant! ''[hands Patrick a bag full of money]'' I've never seen such an example of raw creativity! This will turn the art world on its head! I hereby declare this the next big thing! ''[echoes. The customers swarm the Krusty Krab and hold up their money]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You did it, Patrick! You found your inspiration!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[holds up his money bag]'' And I'm going to need some more of those patty thingies!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You got it, buddy! ''[jumps into the kitchen and flips some patties, which fly out to Patrick. Patrick decorates a patty and gives it to Tom, who gives him another money bag]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Huh? ''[hears cha-ching]'' Ooh, money! Money, money, money, money, money, money, money! ''[opens the cash register and notices it's empty, then gasps]'' What the? ''[gasps again and notices customers giving money to Patrick and SpongeBob giving him patties]'' SpongeBob! ''[grabs SpongeBob]'' Patrick! ''[grabs Patrick and pulls both of them into his office]'' What's the meaning of this?}}
{{L|Patrick|It's my art. Uh, I buy Krabby Patties for $3 and I..I sell them for $50. ''[Mr. Krabs gets mad. SpongeBob and Patrick get worried]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Ha and ha!}}
{{L|Patrick|Why is he so mad, Squidward? I was just following your advice!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What?! ''[to Squidward]'' It was your idea, huh?}}
{{L|''[Cuts to SpongeBob bringing more patties out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Here's a whole new batch of Krabby Patty canvases.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Great, SpongeBob! That'll be fifty bucks!}}
{{L|Nat|''[hands Mr. Krabs money]'' It's so inexpensive!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And here's your patty! One more art patty, Mr. Star!}}
{{L|Nat|It's such an honor to meet you!}}
{{L|Patrick|I can only imagine! Apprentice! Make another of my masterpieces, good man.}}
{{L|''[Squidward grabs the patty and starts to glue]''}}
{{L|Patrick|If you work real hard, you may be an artist too someday!}}
{{L|''[Squidward growls at Patrick. Patrick looks at the patty]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Mm, probably not. Needs more glitter.}}
{{L|''[Squidward breaks down bawling, ending the episode]''}}
