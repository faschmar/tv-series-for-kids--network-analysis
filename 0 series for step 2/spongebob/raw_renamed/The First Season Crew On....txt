{{L|''[Starts off showing the words "The First Season Crew on..." Then shows the words "Visual Writing." Then shows Erik Wiese.]''}}
{{L|Erik Wiese|We really use animation to its fullest extent, you know a lot of people aren't doing that these days. We're trying to keep it, you know reality based. This was a cartoon show.}}
{{L|Sherm Cohen|There's a time and a place for a script driven show. There's a time and a place for an artist driven show, and I think SpongeBob works best because it's a cartoon driven show.}}
{{L|Erik Wiese|We got to do a lot of cartoon gags, exploited animation as much as possible.}}
{{L|''[Shows the words "Pitching" before switching to Ennio Torresan."]''}}
{{L|Ennio Torresan|I hated pitching, it was so, it was an extra effort to draw and pitch.}}
{{L|''[Switches to the pitching for the episode "Jellyfish Jam" on September 28, 1998. It then switches back to Erik.]''}}
{{L|Erik Wiese|We have to pitch to, you know the forty people and crew, but before that it would be you know a sleepless night. You know, just tossing and turning because I have a fear of crowds, but what happened is, the next morning I would, you know tons of sugar and lots of espressos, extra sugar, sugar in my Coca-Cola. Run around the block and then get in there and just try to pitch, and try not to look at the faces, and you just go through it and hopefully you get the laugh so they don't pick up how nervous you are.}}
{{L|''[Switches to the pitching for the episode "Home Sweet Pineapple" on December 11, 1998. The shows the word "Editing" before showing Lynn Hobson.]''}}
{{L|Lynn Hobson|SpongeBob was really fun, for like I said the very reason that we could come up with a lot of gags in post production.}}
{{L|Tony Ostyn|We did a lot of Frankensteining on the show. We did a lot of taking cannibalizing from different takes to come up with a line just so it sounded nearly exactly the way they wanted it to.}}
{{L|Lynn Hobson|It was because it was sort of guerilla animation. So we could just do things on the fly, and add a minute the last minute if they were appropriate, and you know, made the show funnier.}}
{{L|''[Shows the words "Underwater." Then switches to Dene Ann Heming.]''}}
{{L|Dene Ann Heming|Scuba diving is one of my favorite things to do. I could take my experiences underwater, and think about the different sea life and you know, use those things as color references.}}
{{L|John Seymore|I was snorkeling or scuba diving on vacations in locations where this kind of plant life existed in the ocean. I appreciated so much more than in the past. I was going, "Whoa hey! I draw that thing. There's that thing and that's what it really looks down here."}}
{{L|''[Shows the words "Partners." Then switches to Sherm Cohen.]''}}
{{L|Sherm Cohen|Aaron Springer is a cartoon genius.}}
{{L|''[Switches to Aaron Springer, who takes a sip out of a cup. Then goes back to Sherm Cohen.]}}
{{L|Sherm Cohen|And the hardest thing about working with Aaron is that he has about twenty thousand ideas for every one idea that I have.}}
{{L|Aaron Springer|Sherm hated when I used sharpies because it would give him a headache. So, but I think he secretly liked it.}}
{{L|''[Shows the words "Work Environment." Then switches to Kenny Pittenger.]''}}
{{L|Kenny Pittenger|Life in a cubicle, it's sad.}}
{{L|''[Shows a clip of Kenny in his cubicle.]''}}
{{L|Kenny Pittenger|You think it's easy don't ya. Sit down, have a bagel, some coffee. Draw a few pictures, la la la, no. It's not the simple.}}
{{L|''[Switches back to Kenny.]''}}
{{L|Kenny Pittenger|But it was kind of fun because you have a lot of interaction with people around you. But the problem with that is, when you want to get something done, you're trying to concentrate. It just doesn't happen.}}
{{L|''[Shows a montage of people having fun in the office. Including dancing, dressing up for Halloween, and more. Then shows the words "Final Words." Then shows Paul Tibbitt.]''}}
{{L|Paul Tibbitt|Personally first season is my favorite season of all of them. I mean I think, you know, we weren't, we were just hitting our stride, and you can see a lot more of the styles of the individual directors in first season shows.}}
{{L|Teale Wang|I feel like personally, SpongeBob and Patrick are my children and everyday I come to work and I have to dress them. Just like I would my kid in the morning, and that's just you know my favorite shows that I have ever worked on have been like that.}}
{{L|Mr. Lawrence|We have a staff that's really there, and on it one hundred percent, and they're happy to be there, they're happy to be, they feel like they're all contributing to this great, you know nucleus.}}
{{L|Derek Iversen|The people on it were so much fun, and they brought together so much. They brought together talent, and a great sense of humor.}}
{{L|Andy Clark|SpongeBob was just one of those shows, where the right elements and the right people, were at the right place and the right time}}
{{L|Jennie Monica|Everybody bonded really well. Everyone got along great, and we were like one big happy family.}}
{{L|Kenny Pittenger|Those were good times. Good times.}}
