{{L|''[everyone is enjoying their day at the Goo Lagoon, SpongeBob and Patrick both see a surfer riding a wave]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|See, Patrick? Now that is surfing!}}
{{L|Patrick|I wanna try! I wanna try!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's do it! ''[lies on his back on the water]'' Your surfboard awaits.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oooooohhh.}}
{{L|''[Patrick is on SpongeBob, he sees a wave and surfs on it, and laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This is awesome! ''[but because he's a sponge, he starts absorbing water, and grows bigger]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I feel so floaty! Hey, why aren't we, huh? ''[SpongeBob is now at gigantic size, with all of the water absorbed]''}}
{{L|Surfer|Uh, excuse me. Can we have our ocean back?}}
