{{L|SpongeBob|''[walks around with boxes, then stops, drops the boxes, and gasps]'' I almost forgot. It's "Surprise Sandy Day." ''[The calendar is seen. One of the dates on it is "Surprise Sandy Day"]'' The only question is how to surprise her.}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob tunneling to Sandy's treedome. He stops in front of it and sees Sandy writing something on a piece of paper. SpongeBob then knocks on the door. Sandy turns around]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Hello? ''[Flowers drop from the ceiling and land in a vase on the table. Sandy turns around]'' What in tarnation? ''[There is a note attached to the flowers. Sandy reads it]'' "To Sandy, the smartest, prettiest squirrel in Bikini Bottom. Signed, a Friend." ''[We see SpongeBob giggling on top of the treedome. He jumps down. Sandy chuckles and somehow sees him]'' I wonder who it could be from. ''[SpongeBob runs away. But before he does, he jumps in the air and clicks his heels, happy that Sandy got the message]''}}
