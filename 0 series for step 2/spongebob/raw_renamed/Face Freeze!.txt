{{L|''[episode begins at Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Thanks for having lunch with me, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Anything for my bestest buddy. There's no better way I could've spent my lunch break. ''[slurps his drink and makes a relaxed face]'' Ahh.}}
{{L|Patrick|That's a pretty cool face. ''[chuckles]'' Check you this one out. ''[chomps, chews]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, hey, how about this? ''[dolphin call]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's awesome! ''[he and Patrick both laugh]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[snores]'' Ooh. I know that sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick laughs]'' SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry, sir. I got carried away. Patrick and I were making faces at each other.}}
{{L|Patrick|Funny faces make me laugh! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What?! Are you out of your liquid-absorbing mind?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why, is there something wrong?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Haven't ye ever heard the saying "If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way"?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Uh, no!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Let me tell you the story of face freeze. ''[thunder claps, SpongeBob and Patrick's tooth chattering, breathing quickly]'' It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out. ''[Fred raspberries and laughs]'' But what he really liked, was sticking his tongue at people. ''[Fred raspberries and laughs, Norma and green Monroe gasp]''}}
{{L|Norma Rechid|How rude! ''[walks away with Monroe, who's crying]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Fred raspberries to other people]'' Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time, ''[Fred raspberries]'' his face froze with his tongue sticking out...}}
{{L|Fred|''[touches his tongue]'' Huh, huh... Huh?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|...permanently!}}
{{L|Mable|Weirdo. ''[walks off]''}}
{{L|Fred|''[muffled]'' No... no!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off! ''[Fred's tongue snaps]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[back to reality]'' Oh, no!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So are you gonna keep making faces, boys?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Mm-mm.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Good. I hope you've learned your lesson.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again.}}
{{L|Patrick|Done and done.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face.}}
{{L|Patrick|Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah. This is... ''[gulps]'' easy. How you holding up?}}
{{L|Patrick|Huh, fine. You? ''[SpongeBob grunts, but makes an T-shaped face and laughs]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[fails to keep a straight face and makes an ugly face]'' Dun ah eeh. ''[both SpongeBob and him are laughing, SpongeBob suddenly stops and looks at his himself]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey! ''[Patrick is still ignoring him while laughing]'' Patrick. ''[pulls out a megaphone]'' Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[stretching]'' Gosh, you're right.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true, let's make lots of faces.}}
{{L|Patrick|You mean like this? ''[stretching]'' Ree eeh eeh!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both, SpongeBob growls]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[laughs]'' Aye yi yi yi!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Aw!}}
{{L|''[montage of SpongeBob and Patrick making grotesque faces]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Phee!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ay yi yi yi yi yi!}}
{{L|Patrick|Dun ree ah yee!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Doy doy doy doy!}}
{{L|Patrick|Ah ah ooh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Duh!}}
{{L|Patrick|Aydh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Awoot duh doo!}}
{{L|Patrick|Looo ooo ooo!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Dah yah dah da dah!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick both laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't breathe! I can't breathe! ''[grabs a mirror and they look into it]'' Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes! But, how to choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross. ''[makes his eyes go up to the top of his head]'' And then slip into an overbite. ''[pulls out his upper jaw]'' And the finishing touch. Gah lowh.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[chuckles]'' Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one... ''[pushes his nose, makes his mouth bigger and puts out his eyeballs on the top of his head]'' The "Gary". Meow!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[chuckles]'' Gloriously disgusting, sir.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share them with the whole wide sea.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing and running. Cutting to the scene where they're on the bus while the other passengers are hiding behind them. And then cutting to the scene at [[Goo Lagoon]], they come out of the pool, making everybody swim away screaming.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[paddling up on a surfboard]'' You two need help.}}
{{L|''[The scene bubble transitions into outside their house at night. SpongeBob and Patrick are in the tent.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, SpongeBob! ''[turns on the flashlight, both of them are laughing, Patrick then turns off the flashlight.]'' Hey, SpongeBob! ''[turns on the flashlight, both of them are laughing, Patrick then turns off the flashlight.]'' Hey, SpongeBob! ''[turns on the flashlight, both of them are laughing, Patrick then turns off the flashlight.]'' Hey, SpongeBob! ''[both of them laughing again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It never gets so old! ''[Patrick turns off flashlight.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[comes up and rips the tent]'' Do you mind?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mind what? Making faces? Of course, we don't! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]''}}
{{L|Patrick|You got that right, pal! What a silly question.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Your turn, Squidward, let's see your crazy face.}}
{{L|Squidward|I don't wanna make faces. I want to SLEEP! ''[growls in anger]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's a good one right there. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, good one, Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the... quiet of sleep!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh yeah? Watch me. ''[both SpongeBob and Patrick falling sleep]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Whatever works. ''[goes back to his house. The scene bubble transitions into the sun rises.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[wakes up and surprised]'' Wow, Patrick, you did hold that face all night!}}
{{L|Patrick|Actually, I can't move my face at all. ''[feels on his face]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't move my face either!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[oblivious and excited]'' Alright! We did it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick! It's not alright, this means Mr. Krabs was right! ''[Patrick then realizes the situation and gets scared]'' Patrick, we have the face freeze! ''[both scream]'' Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Sandy! Sandy!}}
{{L|''[Later, at Sandy's treedome]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Hmm, this may get tricky. Y'all need to relax them facial muscles, what y'all need is a massage.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And you're a licensed masseuse, right, Sandy?}}
{{L|Sandy|Well, I shouldn't say licensed. Just sit back, relax, ''[shows Sandy's hands looking creepy]'' and let my gentle mammalian hands melt away that tension. ''[starting to message both of their face]'' You seem to be carrying a lot of stress in your eyeballs. Them shoulders look way outta line. I can feel them knots just meltin' away. Let's see if I can just finesse that jaw line back in place. ''[after the montage of Sandy messaging both of their face...]'' Phew! Okay, you two. Bad news first. That wicked face freeze ain't going nowhere. But, y'all are looking much more relaxed. ''[showing that SpongeBob's and Patrick's faces are more deformed.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[At the Krusty Krab]'' Ahoy, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hello, Mr. Krabs. ''[walks with his back towards him to the kitchen and Mr. Krabs goes in as well]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, you all right, boy? Eh, look a little cattywampus walking in here.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Doing fine, Mr. Krabs. Just grillin' and grillin'...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ahem. Uh, but what's with the skewed posture? ''[touches SpongeBob's head and SpongeBob knocks his claw away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, did you hear that? Someone somewhere just dropped a penny.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gasps]'' Penny? Where?! Where?! ''[looks for a penny]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That'll buy me some time.}}
{{L|Squidward|Let's go, SpongeBob, the orders are piling up.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm on it, Squidward! ''[starts slicing an onion, but onion juice gets in his eyes]'' Onion juice! Ah!}}
{{L|Squidward|Come on, SpongeBob! Chop, chop!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, okay. ''[falls, retrieves patties on back]'' Ow! Phew. Order up.}}
{{L|Squidward|You deliver it, I'm on break.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny. ''[sniffs]'' Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs is still distracted. Now's my chance. ''[passes Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sniffs]'' Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Your order is served, sir.}}
{{L|Harold|''[gasps when he sees that SpongeBob's lips are drooling on the patties]'' I'm sorry, I did not order a side of lips with my patty!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, dear.}}
{{L|Harold|''[takes his money out of his register]'' I'm taking my clams elsewhere.}}
{{L|''[As SpongeBob tiptoes behind Mr. Krabs on the way back to the kitchen, Mr. Krabs takes notice of Harold leaving and chases him to the door]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wait, come back!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why? Oh, why? Why did I have to make a face?! ''[whimpers]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What's going on back here? Why are we losing business?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um, how should I know? I'm just the cook in these parts.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Face me when I'm talking to you, boy-o. ''[SpongeBob turns around with his face down]'' So I can see your face.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, have you seen this, Mr. Krabs? ''[shows him a rolling trick]'' My impersonation of a burrito!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, you better stand up this instant or... huh? ''[sees Patrick walk in with face freeze]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[sees Mr. Krabs and gets worried]'' Oh. Is this a bad time, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, I see what's going on here. ''[picks up SpongeBob and turns to see his frozen face.]'' A-ha! You just had to keep making faces, didn't ya? You couldn't heed me warning, could ya?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[guilty]'' I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. We thought it was just one of your stories.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm losing business because you thought I was telling one of me stories?! Why, this makes me so angry! I could just... just... just... ah! ''[his anger gives himself the face freeze]'' No! I can't move my face! I've got the face freeze, too!}}
{{L|Squidward|What is the hold up in here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait, Squidward, don't get worked up! You could get the face freeze!}}
{{L|Squidward|Face freeze? I thought that was a myth? Ha! Krabs too! ''[begins laughing hard]'' This is rich! Ha ha ha! Oh. ''[sees Patrick and begins laughing very hard and he too gets face freeze]'' Hey, my face! Ah, my face. Oh, great, look at what you've done. ''[begins crying]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Look! Squidward has it, too! ''[Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob begin laughing while Squidward keeps crying]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey, i- it's not funny! Stop laughing!}}
