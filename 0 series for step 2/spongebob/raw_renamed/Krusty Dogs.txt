{{L|SpongeBob|''[has Krabby Patty meat in a container]'' Ooh... delicious!}}
{{L|''[He blows out more Krabby Patties onto a nearby table and puts them all into the freezer, then rolls up the leftover meat into a top hat then puts it on.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[British accent]'' Top of the morning to ya! ''[laughs, then makes the meat into a version of Gary and it meows. Then makes the meat into a telephone and answers it]'' Krusty Krab, SpongeBob speaking! ''[laughs again but the telephone suddenly starts to ring and answers it]'' Gary? Is that you? ''[pause]'' Gary, I know you're there. I can hear you breathing! ''[hangs the phone up then makes the meat into a hot dog-like shape and gasps]'' Ooh! ''[boils the meat in water on the stove]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|One wiener later...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[enters Mr. Krabs' office holding the hot dog]'' Mr. Krabs! This wiener tastes just like a Krabby Patty! Maybe we could add them to the menu?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm not impressed...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I made it with leftover ingredients.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now I'm impressed!}}
{{L|Frank|''[enters the Krusty Krab and walks to the empty cash register]'' Hmm... I could've sworn that sign said "Open."}}
{{L|Squidward|''[outside]'' Sigh... Once in a while, I need to breathe in and not smell grease. Or the stench of my miserably failed life... Talking to myself... again...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[shows Mr. Krabs how to make a Krusty Dog]'' And then I just cooked it like this!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Go on.}}
{{L|Frank|My! What an interesting shape! Are those for sale?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Why? Would you like to buy one?}}
{{L|Frank|Well, that would depend on the price.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Would you pay the same as what a Krabby Patty costs?}}
{{L|Frank|Hmm... sure, I suppose so!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|How about double?}}
{{L|Frank|Now you're talking!}}
{{L|Customer|Krabby Patties again? ''[sighs]'' If only there were something else... ''[notices Frank eating a Krusty Dog]'' Hey, whatcha got there Frank?}}
{{L|Frank|It's new! Tastes just like a Krabby Patty, but it's shaped like a wiener! ''[walks off]''}}
{{L|All three customers|That sounds interesting!}}
{{L|Dave|''[talking to SpongeBob]'' Hey! I'd like to request a wiener!}}
{{L|Two customers|Me too!}}
{{L|All three customers|Wieners! Wieners! Wieners!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs climbs up to the menu sign and writes "Krusty Dogs" on it in red chalk]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, what's that noise?}}
{{L|Squidward|Excruciating.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Up here, boy! Take a look!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't read it from here, Mr. Krabs! What's it say?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It says "Krusty Dogs, only $3.99!" Or $4.99 with cheese!}}
{{L|Squidward|$4.99!? That's highway robbery!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Avec fromage, Monsieur Squidward. Avec fromage.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My Krusty Dog! Handwritten on the menu! Oh, pinch me Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|Pinch yourself, you ninny.}}
{{L|French Narrator|The following day...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[runs to SpongeBob holding a ticket]'' SpongeBob! Three more Krusty Dogs! Pronto!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye, aye Captain! ''[dumps three Krusty Dogs in a pan of hot water]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! Three more orders of Krusty Dogs! Extra Krusty!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, Mr. Krabs! We sure are gettin' a lot of orders for Krusty Dogs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yep!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, I'll get those going right after I finish cooking up these Krabby Patties!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, forget about making those patties! Just make the wieners! ''[gives SpongeBob the ticket]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Just make the wieners? ''[follows Mr. Krabs who is holding a ladder]'' Um, excuse me, Mr. Krabs? Uh, w-where are you going with that ladder? Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm just going to make a few changes to the Krusty Krab menu, that's all.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Changes...?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, that reminds me! Do you have an eraser I could borrow?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Eraser?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[on top of the ladder]'' Ah, never mind. I'll just cross it off. ''[uses the chalk to mark out "Krabby Patties"]'' No more Krabby Patties!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[shocked]'' No more Krabby Patties...''[passes out, then two paramedics put a breathing mask on him]''}}
{{L|Paramedic 1|Okay, just breathe normally, son.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No more Krabby Patty…}}
{{L|Paramedic 1|There you go. That's it.}}
{{L|Paramedic 2|There! He's startin' to revive.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I had this horrible dream that Mr. Krabs was never gonna let me cook Krabby Patties again. ''[sees Mr. Krabs pushing his grill out from the kitchen, much to his shock]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Pardon me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[falls on the floor crying]''}}
{{L|Paramedic 2|We're losin' 'im!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Mr. Krabs throws grill into trash heap]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[zoomed in on Mr. Krabs eyes]'' SpongeBob. SpongeBob. Wake up.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|''[being held in the two paramedics arms]'' Where am I? And what are these paramedics doing here?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You're back in yer old kitchen. And the pair of paramedics were here to revive ye.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I was asleep?}}
{{L|Kr. Krabs|Yea, but just for a little while, so I only docked your pay for the time you were unconscious.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks over at the empty space where the grill used to be]'' Mr. Krabs, isn't that where the grill used to be? ''[points to empty space]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Maybe. But now we have this! ''[unveils a small hot dog cooker]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And what about my... my spatula? ''[tears fill his eyes]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I gotcha a new one! ''[lifts up hot dog holder]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[catches hot dog holder, accidentally pinching his nose with it]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs and the paramedics|''[laugh at SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Alright! Those wieners aren't going to rotisserie themselves. Everybody back to work.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs and paramedics|''[walk away]'' ''[Mr. Krabs pushes the hot dog cooker up to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye aye, captain. ''[he sadly taps the small cooker with the hot dog holder]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[approaches Squidward]'' Squidward, can I talk to you for one second?}}
{{L|Squidward|I don't know. That's a pretty long talk.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Has anything ever happened at your job that made it... not as fun as it used to be?}}
{{L|Squidward|Actually, yes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Really?! What was it?}} 
{{L|Squidward|Being hired.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know why, but things aren't just the same after Krusty Dogs were added to the menu.}} 
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, my boy, I realized long ago that there is nothing, I repeat, nothing, that could make this job any more boring, or humiliating, or demeaning that it already is.}} 
{{L|Squidward|''[wearing hot dog suit outside the Krusty Krab]''}} 
{{L|Billy|Look at that guy dressed like a hot dog, Mommy.}} 
{{L|Mom|Let that inspire you to stay in school, Billy.}} 
{{L|Billy|''[runs back and kicks Squidward]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[approaches Mr. Krabs, who is hammering a sign to a support beam]'' Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ahoy, SpongeBob! How goes the wieners?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Eh, I was kinda wondering... could we just go back to selling Krabby Patties?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What on earth for?! Krusty Dogs was your best idea ever, boy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I know. Well, I guess I sorta miss the Krabby Patties. After all, they're what gave this place its name.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah, good point.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah! Don't you think that we should… ''[watches Mr. Krabs dash outside and change the sign to "The Krusty Dogs]'' Krusty Dogs?! Those wieners have got to go!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[serves Abigail-Marge and Dale their hot dogs]'' Here you are, hungry customers, your delicious Krusty Dogs!}}
{{L|Abigail-Marge|They do look delicious!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes! ''[whispers into her ear]'' Eat one and you'll develop an unsightly skin condition.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[approaches another customer]'' Here's your footlong, sir!}} 
{{L|Jimmy|Thanks! 12 inches of deliciousness!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah! You know what gives them that added flavor?}}
{{L|Jimmy|No, what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[whispers into ear]''  Nose hairs and recycled dental floss.}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, what are you doing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We have gotta get rid of these wieners and bring back the Krabby Patty!}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, I never thought I'd be saying this, but... count me in!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hooray!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[The scene bubble transitions into a customer is about to eat the Krusty Dog. Suddenly, Squidward bursts into the Krusty Krab]'' Help! I'm having terrible abdominal pain! I think it was the... the... ''[looks over at SpongeBob]'' Line?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[quietly]'' Wiener.}}
{{L|Squidward|The wiener!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[dressed in a brown coat and beard]'' Ladies and gentlemen! Allow me to introduce myself. I am but a simple, old-timey gentlemen. I came here for one purpose today.}}
{{L|Mabel|So I said, it didn't smell so bad, but it tastes aw-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Quiet, Granny, I'm talking!}}
{{L|Mabel|Oh.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And that is to loudly decry these modern, new-fangled days of wieners, and to band for a return to a simpler time. A Krabby Pattier time! ''[looks at customers]''}} 
{{L|Sadie|I'm not really concerned about possible ill-health effects. How about you guys?}}
{{L|Clay|Eh.}}
{{L|Dennis|How about nostalgia?}} 
{{L|Sadie|Never heard of 'em. ''[continues eating]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, that didn't work at all.}}
{{L|Squidward|It only seemed to increase their appetite for wieners.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We need stronger tactics.}} 
{{L|Squidward|Right, something that would make Mr. Krabs' whole wiener thing blow right up in his face!}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, blow up. ''[facial expression changes to happy]'' Squidward, that's it! ''[skips and laughs away]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob| ''[grabs balloons from a drawer, puts one in a Krusty Dog]'' Beautiful.}}
{{L|SpongeBob| ''[serves to customer with a air pump connected to the Krusty Dog]'' Your Krusty Dog, sir, with extra mustard.}} 
{{L|Nat|Thanks.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Can I bring you something else? ''[silence]'' Okay, I guess not. Thank you sir. ''[walks away]''}} 
{{L|Nat|''[picks up the Krusty Dog, slowly starts bringing it to his mouth]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[watches the customer]'' Wait for it, SpongeBob. Wait for it. Now! ''[pushes down on air pump, filling up the balloon, and the hot dog]''}}
{{L|Sadie|Yeah, remember that, that was... Oh, my Neptune! ''[sees the hot dog expanding]'' That Krusty Dog is about to explode!}}
{{L|Nat|What? Where? ''[the Krusty Dog explodes, shooting meat on all the customers]''}}
{{L|All customers|''[begin screaming and angrily leaving]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Have a nice day!}} 
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! What happened in here? Where all me customers?! What are we gonna do?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oooh! I know the answer.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[pops in the window looking at SpongeBob grilling Krabby Patties]'' Hey, SpongeBob! Have you seen Mr. Squidward?}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|I think he's outside on his break.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Perfect! And keep them Krabby Patties coming, boy!}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye aye, captain!}} 
{{L|Squidward|''[standing outside the Krusty Krab in a Krabby Patty suit, waving a sign saying "THEY'RE BACK!"]''}}. 
{{L|Billy|Mom, look! It's a guy dressed as a Krabby Patty!}} 
{{L|Mom|It's never too soon to start picking a good college, Billy. ''[runs back and kicks Squidward to the ground]''}} 
{{L|Squidward|Well, I guess I was wrong again. It can always get more humiliating.}}
