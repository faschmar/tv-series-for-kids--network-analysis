{{L|Squidward|This is your fault!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, buddy. I can give you a hand.}}
{{L|Squidward|No, you have helped me enough. I don't want your help ever again!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No problem, pal. ''[walks away]''}}

{{L|Squidward|Ha ha ha.}}
{{L|Scooter|I knew you would eventually get it, dude. ''[laughs. SpongeBob is looking at Squidward]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Stop staring, SpongeBob. You're affecting my productivity.}}
{{L|Sandals|I would like to order one Krabby Patty.}}
{{L|Squidward|That'll be three dollars.}}
{{L|Sandals|''[with many pennies]'' Do you accept pennies?}}
{{L|Squidward|I don't have time to count all that!}}
{{L|Sandals|Oh, well, have it your way. I'll just take my loose change elsewhere!}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, please do, I'm trying to get some work done here. Sheesh, some people just want to waste your time. ''[Fred is tapping his feet]'' Hey, buddy! How am I supposed to focus with all of that incessant tapping? And what do you think you're doing, sir?}}

''[to SpongeBob]'' And SpongeBob, would you quit singing that song?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's the matter, Squidward? Don't you have an attitude of gratitude?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sighs]'' SpongeBob, I hate my job, and I live in a dead end town with neighbors I can't stand. I'm the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom! What do I have to be thankful for?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, it could be worse.}}
{{L|Squidward|How could life in Bikini Bottom possibly get any worse?}}

{{L|Nat|Mount Bikini Bottom's erupting!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's how.}}
{{L|Lloyd|Cool.}}
{{L|Scooter|Look, the roof! ''[lava and fire is burning down the Krusty Krab,and everyone runs around screaming]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Eh, ya lemons. Afraid of a little lavar? ''[lava splashes on the cash register]'' Cashy! No! Make it stop raining fiery destruction! ''[sobs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry to interrupt your crying, Mr. Krabs, but shouldn't we get to a place that at least doesn't have a roof with lava coming through it? ''[everyone evacuates]'' Fear not, shelter can't be far a-}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, why even bother, SpongeBob? Can't you see? Civilization as we know is crumbling to dust! ''[a hideous close-up is shown]'' Civic orders is in tatters. It's every man for himself, there's no other way. I'm gonna need your life essence! ''[grabs SpongeBob and Squidward]''}}

{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[lets go]'' Oh, yes. Of course, ma'am. ''[to SpongeBob and Squidward]'' Try and behave yourselves, fellers.}}
{{L|''[Cut to a building with a sign reading, "Volcano Shelter" on it. Inside, citizens argue angrily.]''}}
{{L|Mayor|No need to get excited, citizens. The government is working tirelessly to defeat this evil volcano.}}
{{L|''[a member of the crowd angrily smashes the nameplate that reads "MAYOR".]''}}
{{L|Billy|What are we gonna do?}}
{{L|Mayor|Don't worry. We've got it under control.}}
{{L|Billy|''[jerks on the mayor]'' Under control? Half the city's on fire! ''[the two of the police angrily walk up to him]'' You call THAT under control? Huh? Do ya? ''[being taken away]'' The end is near, Mayor.}}
{{L|Harold|That guy's on to something. What are you hiding from us, Mayor? Do you have some secret? Is the end near?}}
{{L|''[the crowd of citizens angrily stretches their arms, but SpongeBob raises his hand.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, please. I've got something.}}
{{L|Mayor|Oh! Yes, boy? How do you propose we stop the volcano?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[takes out parking tickets]'' Actually, I just had a question about these parking tickets. I don't have a car.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, boy. Moron.}}
{{L|Mayor|We're doomed!}}
{{L|''[a shadowy figure appears in the doorway, laughing. The figure reveals to be a humanized dolphin holding a staff.]''}}
{{L|Dolphin Warrior|''[laughs]'' You fools!}}
{{L|[''The crowd of Bikini Bottom citizens looks at the dolphin flying on his staff. He lands on behind the mayor's desk.]''}}
{{L|Mayor|Who are you?}}
{{L|Dolphin Warrior|''[laughing]'' I am an ancient warrior from long ago. The last of my kind who ruled over the ocean from before the dawn of time. But, alas, my people were wiped out by the same volcano that plagues you now.}}
{{L|Harold|Then how did you survive?}}
{{L|Dolphin Warrior|''[laughs]'' I survived, because I was the only one who knew how to stop it!}}
{{L|Harold|Well, don't keep us in suspense. How did you stop it?}}
{{L|Dolphin Warrior|You must make... a sacrifice!}}
{{L|''[everyone gasps]''}}
{{L|Harold|What kind of sacrifice?}}
{{L|Dolphin Warrior|A sacrifice must be made of the most miserable person.}}
{{L|Harold|I knew it! We have to sacrifice the most miserable person!}}
{{L|Monica|And who would that be?}}
{{L|Harold|Well, it certainly isn't me! ''[The crowd of citizens argues, pointing at each other. We look at SpongeBob, Squidward, and Krabs, as the citizens continue pointing at each other.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Squidward, who do you think is the most miserable person?}}
{{L|Squidward|Don't know, don't care. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But, Squidward, it's imperative that we...}}
{{L|Squidward|''[imitating SpongeBob]'' But, Squidward, it is imperative that we... ''[regular voice]'' Nothing! I think I'd rather take my chances with the volcano than be stuck in this miserable barnacle hole with you ''[the citizens who continue arguing hear Squidward talking]'' and the citizens of Dumb-Dumb Town!}} 
{{L|Man|Oh, oh, we're idiots now! Oh, nice! Nice!}}
{{L|Woman| I'm a solitary smart woman.}}
{{L|[''A group of citizens walks to the exit of the stage, where they equip their torches and pitchforks, forming a mob to make a sacrifice.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What?}}
{{L|Male Fish|''[The mob of citizens angrily carrying Squidward marches to the volcano.]'' Miserable Squidward! Oh, you ''are ''miserable!}}
{{L|Squidward|You idiots! You've got the wrong guy!}}
{{L|Dale|We heard you complaining about the fingerprints.}}
{{L|Nat|And the foot tapping.}}
{{L|Sandals|And my loose change.}}
{{L|Mabel|And my teeth! ''[points to the fish from earlier a hat]'' And his hat!}}
{{L|Scooter|And you called your pipe stupid.}}
{{L|Lloyd|And the fact that you said you were the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom! ''[plays tape recorder]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[on the tape recorder]'' I'm the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom! Oh, would you just... ''[grumbles]'' Let me down, you goons!}}
{{L|Mayor|Sorry, Mr. Tentacles. Throw him in, fellas.}}
{{L|Squidward|No!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait! It is I who makes Squidward miserable. Throw me in instead.}}
{{L|Mayor|Works for me.}}
{{L|''[The trio puts Squidward down.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, I'm glad that y'all came to your senses. Bunch of ingrates. Come on, SpongeBob. Jump in. ''[Squidward steps on the ledge; it breaks and Squidward falls and holds on to other ledges]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[screams]'' SpongeBob, help!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'd love to, Squidward, but you said to not help you ever again! And that being my neighbor left you with nothing to be grateful for. I made a promise!}}
{{L|Squidward|I take it back! ''[screaming]'' Please SpongeBob, I didn't mean any of that! I do appreciate your friendship. I am grateful. I'm... I'm... ''[cries]'' I'm grateful for the life I'm living! Who knows how long I'll have it? I learned that from you, remember? Goodbye, everyone! ''[the cliff crumbles and Squidward falls and screams]'' Huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grabs him]'' Squidward, I always knew you felt that way. ''[pulls him up]'' Aw, buddy. Thanks for finally opening up to us.}}
{{L|''[the pipe at Squidward's house bursts causing it to fall into the volcano. everyone except Squidward cheers]''}}
{{L|Squidward|My house!}}
{{L|Dolphin Warrior|Ah, now the volcano is appeased!}}
{{L|Squidward|But I thought you said a sacrifice had to be made of the most miserable person.}}
{{L|Dolphin Warrior|''[chuckles]'' No! You didn't let me finish. ''[looks at the camera]'' I was trying to say, a sacrifice of the most miserable person's house. No one ever listens to me. ''[laughs as he flies away on his scepter]''}}
{{L|Squidward|You know SpongeBob, in light of everything that just happened... I lied to you. I am not grateful for anything! I mean look at me. I don't even have a roof to sleep under, anymore!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I wouldn't say that. ''[bubble transition to SpongeBob going to bed with Squidward.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Go away. ''[turns out lights. Cut to black.]''}}
