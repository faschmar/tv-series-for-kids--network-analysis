{{L|''[At the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is in the bathroom, looking at a filthy sink mirror.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're nothing! Is all that grime meant to scare me, Mr. Mirror? I've met sardines tougher than you are. Time to put you in your place. ''[squirts soap on his head and scrubs the mirror clean, then puts his work hat on his head from his nose]'' Looking good, mirror! Sorry about the harsh words. ''[gets a mop and a bucket]'' Now to attack these floors!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[in his office, on the phone, chuckling]'' Are you kidding? He's an absolute treasure to have around the restaurant!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[chuckles]'' Sounds like Mr. Krabs is bragging about me again to his associates. ''[turns to reveal an ear on his back]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And he's been with me for such a long time now.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[chuckles again]'' I am.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let the little guy go today.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yep, he's gonna have to-- ''[notices, shocked]'' What? Let the little guy go?! Little guy? Who's the little guy? It must be either me, or... ''[gasps]'' Squidward! ''[SpongeBob stands behind Squidward, who is sitting down]'' Phew! I ''am'' taller. You're the little guy, Squidsy!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[stands up]'' No, and I want you to stop calling me Squidsy. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Squidward looked taller there for a second. Better get a more accurate measurement. ''[stands right next to Squidward in the workstation]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What do you think you're doing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, just seeing which one of us is the little guy... ''[makes himself taller, like a skyscraper]'' ...and it looks like it ''is'' you!}}
{{L|Squidward|No, I'm not! ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, wait! ''[becomes short again]'' We haven't measured with my legs at full extension yet! ''[extends his legs]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[off-screen]'' I don't care! Now get back in the kitchen!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You'll care when you find out what's gonna happen to the little guy. Whoa! ''[walks off balance, then falls and breaks a table]'' Oh, who am I kidding? I need to face the facts. ''[makes a strange face]'' Face the facts that ''I'm'' the little guy! ''[tears up, making another face]'' And that Mr. Krabs is letting me go today.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[smiles]'' Krabs is letting you go today? ''[laughs]'' As in I won't have to work with you ever again. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[walks through the doors and becomes flattened, sad]'' Goodbye, Krusty Krab. Goodbye, life as I know it. ''[the wind blows SpongeBob away]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[still on the phone]'' Yeah, as much as I don't like doing it, I have to let him go. ''[a little scallop in a cage is shown]'' Gotten too big for his cage. ''[releases the scallop]'' Go on, little guy. Fly away. You'll be missed.}}
{{L|''[as scallop flies away, SpongeBob floats into his house, landing in a chair]''}}
{{L|Gary|''[meows questioningly]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, what's the use, Gary? ''[his body pops up to his normal self]'' I've lost the will to go on! ''[bursts into tears on the couch, then stops, noticing a rumble from a refrigerator Patrick is pulling with a rope]'' ''[sniffs sadly]'' Hi, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob. ''[happily]'' I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[confused]'' What happened to yours?}}
{{L|Patrick|Nothing, it's just empty.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sad]'' Oh, get it out of my sight! Now that I have no means of purchasing food for myself, I do not need a refrigerator.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, don't get down on yourself, buddy. You can still purchase food for me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, no, I can't, Patrick. I lost my job today. I won't be able to buy food for you, ''[sniffles]'' or Gary, ''[sniffles again]'' or for anybody!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[shocked]'' Oh, no! What are you gonna do?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sad]'' I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I've been a fry cook for so long I... I don't think I can do anything else.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[gets an idea, happily]'' I know, SpongeBob! Just do what I do when ''I'm'' looking for a job. ''[runs to the couch, then sits on it]'' Kick back, watch some TV, ''[turns the TV on with his remote, then holds a carton of Drinkable Sausage with a close-up shot of it]'' and chug down a carton on Drinkable Sausage! ''[drinks from the carton]''}}
{{L|Gary|''[meows while sitting on some newspaper]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[happily]'' Good, Gary! There had to be some job openings in the classifieds. ''[picks up one newspaper while noticing its dirty smell]'' Whoa! Although, these ads smell a little out of date. I better get some fresh ones. ''[bubble transition to SpongeBob reading a clean newspaper]'' Lawyer, no. Too much arguing. Stunt driver, don't have a boating license. Astronaut, don't like food in a bag. Oh, this one sounds interesting. ''Bank Teller Needed''. That shouldn't be too much of a stretch from fry cooking. ''[bubble transition to SpongeBob counting money at a bank while having his name tag on]'' 20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97. ''[flips money up with his spatula, then chops it all up, some flying onto Fred's head, forming the money into a Krabby Patty, as seen in a close-up shot of it]'' Order up! ''[rings the bell once, then employee takes SpongeBob's name tag off, causing SpongeBob to lose air inside of him]'' ''[bubble transition to SpongeBob hammering a nail while building a house]'' What do you think, boss?}}
{{L|Carpenter|''[looks at his house, shocked]'' Clam shells! What have you done, boy? ''[looks at a piece of paper showing what the ''real'' house looks like, while then looking at a house built by SpongeBob shaped into a Krabby Patty]'' I told you to build me a house, not a sandwich! ''[kicks SpongeBob and Patrick out of the construction site]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I guess I'm not a carpenter, Patrick. ''[walks in front of a billboard showing a live sponge]'' I need to start fresh. ''[some words on the billboard sparkle as SpongeBob talks]'' With a job that feels... natural. Something that says, "This is a job for a sponge." Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|No. Oh, but, yes! It's so obvious! You should work at the Krusty Krab. They need a fry cook!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't, Patrick. That's the job I got fired from, remember?}}
{{L|Patrick|Ohhh. Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you. He looks happy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's just a billboard, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Why don't you get a job as a billboard?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I...don't think that's physically possible, ''[happily]'' ''but'' I could audition to be a sponge model.}}
{{L|Patrick|Fine, do it your way.}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick walking into the Bikini Bottom Television (BBTV) building]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! What a setup! Oh, I don't know, Patrick. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I don't have the talent.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, you have the talent. But do you have the natural ability?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, but...wait, isn't that the same thing?}}
{{L|Patrick|Why don't you find out?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[quickly covers the door]'' Wait! I can't do this, Patrick. What if I don't stack up to the competition? Maybe I should just beg Mr. Krabs for my old job back. ''[starts walking out, but Patrick stops him]''}}
{{L|Patrick|No way! It's too late for that now. Krabs doesn't need you anymore. ''This'' is your chance to prove you don't need him. Now get in there and earn me some groceries! ''[pushes SpongeBob through the door to a lady fish, a casting director, looking at a clipboard]'' ''[to casting director]'' My friend here wants to audition for the sponge model role.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, well, ''want'' is a strong word. I'd like an audition, but if you've already cast it, that's fine if you cast it. ''[to Patrick]'' I think she's already cast it. We'd better go, Patrick.}}
{{L|Casting Director|''[stops SpongeBob and Patrick from walking out]'' Hold it. You want the audition, kid? You got it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[turns his whole body around, happily]'' I did?}}
{{L|Casting Director|Show me what you got.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sweats, worried]'' Okay. Here goes. ''[clears throat]'' Patrick, please? ''[Patrick hands out a metal tool and hits it on his forehead, playing a note]'' ♪ ''Laaa!'' ♪ ''[clears throat again]'' Sorry. ''[keeps clearing throat and getting a perfect pitch at the same time, from high to low]''}}
{{L|Casting Director|Okay, okay, okay! Let's get on with this train wreck.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, getting on it. ''[clears throat yet again, then sings off-key]'' ♪ ''When you dream upon a wish, you'll be heartened to know, that hope fills your dish, to the brim!'' ♪}}
{{L|Casting Director|''[unenthusiastically]'' All right, all right. Thank you. I've heard enough.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[runs closely to the casting director]'' How'd I do?}}
{{L|Casting Director|Horribly. I've seen clams with more talent than you. ''[SpongeBob falls down]'' But since the role specifically calls for a real sponge, the part is yours. ''[SpongeBob slowly gets up]'' Here's the script. We start shooting tomorrow at 10. Don't be late. ''[SpongeBob rips himself in half, happily snatches the script, then jumps out of the building]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I guess a sponge ''can'' make it in this town. ''[his pupils turn into stars]'' I am going to be a star! ''[a crowd suddenly comes close to SpongeBob, cheering while holding camera and microphones, while a news reporter faces a camera close to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Barbara|I'm standing here with the new face of television, Mr. SpongeBob SquarePants. ''[to SpongeBob]'' I'm sure the viewing audience would love to know, how does it feel to be the next big thing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Fantastic. ''[puts on sunglasses, then signs an autograph and waves at the crowd chanting, "SpongeBob! SpongeBob!"]''}}
{{L|''[cut to SpongeBob with his eyes closed]''}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob. Did you say something?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, yes, I did, Patrick. ''[points to himself]'' I said, "You're looking at the new face of television."}}
{{L|Patrick|All right!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I better go home and get some beauty sleep.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, beauty sleep!}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick walking on the road]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's right. You are looking at a changed sponge. But don't worry. I won't forget all the people who held me on the way up.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[walks by, carrying golf supplies and even wearing golf clothes]'' Afternoon, boy-o!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah, just as I was saying. I'd like to thank you for giving me my humble start. I won't forget you. ''[he and Patrick walk by]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[scratches his head]'' What was ''that'' about? Oh, probably just nonsense and babbling, as usual. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick on the street right next to SpongeBob's pineapple]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, when next you see me, it shall be on the television. ''[walks into his house]''}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to SpongeBob walking back into the Bikini Bottom Television (BBTV) building towards the casting director, working on a computer]''}}
{{L|Casting Director|Oh, you're back!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A star's first day is his most important.}}
{{L|Casting Director|Great. Let me see if they're ready on set. ''[through a microphone]'' SpongeBob's here, sir. Uh-huh. Okay, great. ''[to SpongeBob]'' Okay, you can go right in.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yippee! ''[happily runs into the set, toward a spotlight]'' I am ready for my close-up, Mr. Director.}}
{{L|Director|''[with a French accent]'' Very well. ''[through a megaphone]'' Lose the pants! ''[a claw snatches SpongeBob's pants, making him naked]'' Hans! Where's my star?! ''[a live-action hand comes out of a dressing room and grabs SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa! What's happening? ''[lights turn on behind SpongeBob, showing a dirty bathroom set]'' Wh-wh-what's happening?!}}
{{L|Director|In this scene, you'll be cleaning bathroom mixtures.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, so, uh, where's my cleaning utensil?}}
{{L|Director|''[mumbles angrily and quietly]'' Don't you get it? You ''are'' the cleaning utensil. ''[SpongeBob suddenly frowns]'' Roll speed! ''[a red light turns on from a camera]''}}
{{L|Charlie|''[as a movie assistant, holding a movie clipboard]'' New Sponge Commercial: Take one. ''[closes clipboard]''}}
{{L|Director|''[through a megaphone]'' Action!}}
{{L|Announcer|''[off-screen]'' Oh, no! Your bathroom is a disaster. Get it cleaned up fast with...the new sponge! ''[while on camera, SpongeBob groans]'' Household chores are a snap with new sponge. It cleans sinks. ''[sink shines after being cleaned by a now dirty SpongeBob]'' Just look at that shine! New sponge cuts through even the toughest grime and grit. New sponge also cleans showers! ''[SpongeBob screams while cleaning the shower, which shines too]'' Ha, ha! That tile looks good as new! ''[SpongeBob sighs, tired]'' But best of all, new sponge can make any toilet sparkle! ''[as SpongeBob hears this, he looks at the toilet dirty inside before going straight in]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Noooo! ''[suddenly stops right before he goes in]'' I can't do this!}}
{{L|Director|''[through a megaphone]'' Cut!}}
{{L|SpongeBob| I'm sorry. I don't think I'm cut out for acting.}}
{{L|Director|''Was''? You said you were professional actor.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I'm not. ''[puts on his work hat]'' I am a fry cook. ''[holds up his spatula]'' That's what I am, and that's what I've always been! I'm sorry to waste your time, mister. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|Director|Wait! Wait!}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs making a money pyramid in his office]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ever so gently...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[slams door loudly, causing Mr. Krabs' money pyramid to fall down]'' Mr. Krabs! ''[while crying a trail of tears toward Mr. Krabs]'' Please let me back, please! I promise I'll do better. ''[hugs Mr. Krabs]'' Please.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Boy, what are you going on about?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sniffles]'' I heard you on the phone saying you were gonna let the little guy go. But I don't wanna go! Please don't let me go, Mr. Krabs! You're looking at the little guy that doesn't want to go.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|All right, boy-o! I won't get rid of ya: on one condition. ''[SpongeBob happily nods]''}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to SpongeBob happily mopping a toilet]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, boy! This is the best job in the world!}}
{{L|Hans|Hey, could you keep it down in there? ''[shown reading a newspaper in a stall while on a toilet]'' I'm trying to concentrate.}}
