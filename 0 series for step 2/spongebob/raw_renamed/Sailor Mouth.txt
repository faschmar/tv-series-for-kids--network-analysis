{{L|''[The title card has men singing part of the song "Sailing Over the Dogger Bank"]'' ♪Watcha twigger she's a proper jubby-jewel... On a passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby!♪ ''[then we see the Krusty Krab at night]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sighs]'' Well, it's the worst time of the day once again. ''[cringes as he changes the "Open" sign to "Closed"]'' Closing time!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hold on there, SpongeBob! ''[pulls SpongeBob back]'' Take that pile of filth out with you. ''[Squidward holds up a trash bag with flies flying around it]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!}}
{{L|Squidward|He means ''this'' filth, you loon. ''[Drops the bag on the floor]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob goes to the dumpster while bringing the trash bag]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[singing]'' Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob throws the trash in the dumpster and then looks at some writings on the dumpster.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmm... dumpster writing! The voice of the people! "Up with bubbles, down with air!" ''[laughs]'' "Nematodes are people too!" ''[laughs]'' Ha, those nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells. ''[writes the word "good" after "smells"]'' Good. ''[laughs]'' Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a ''[dolphin chirp]''.}}
{{L|Garbage man|''[clearly disgusted]'' Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? ''[picks up some garbage bags and leaves]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, sometimes, but not... Recently.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[off-screen]'' Hi, garbage man. ''[appears on-screen]'' Hi, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?}}
{{L|Patrick|"Krabs..." Uh, isn't that the red, sweaty guy you work for?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pointing to "Krabs," then the unseen word]'' Nah-uh, not that word, ''that'' word.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hmm... ''[dolphin chirp]''! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sentence enhancers?}}
{{L|Patrick|You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-O! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I get it! Let me try. ''[clears his throat]'' Hello, Patrick. Lovely ''[dolphin chirp]'' day we're having, isn't it?}}
{{L|Patrick|Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This ''[dolphin chirp]'' day is particularly ''[dolphin chirp]'' lovely!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How ''[dolphin chirp]'' right you are, Patrick!}}
{{L|''[The two continue to say the word a few more times]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, mine, too!}}
{{L|''[both laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It tingles when I laugh!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab the next day]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hello, customers, nice ''[dolphin chirp]'' day we're having, uh? ''[The customers stop eating and stare in shock]''}}
{{L|Incidental 40|''[gasps]'' Did he just say?!}}
{{L|Pirate fish|Aye, he did.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Patrick, how the ''[dolphin chirp]'' are ya?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[sitting at table at the Krusty Krab]'' Pretty ''[dolphin chirp]'' good, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Old Man Jenkins|I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[taps on the microphone and speaks into it]'' Attention, customers, today's special is a ''[dolphin chirp]'' Krabby Patty served in a greasy ''[dolphin chirp]'' sauce and grilled to ''[dolphin chirp]'' perfection. ''[a mother octopus covers her laughing children's ears and puts soda on one since she doesn't have enough hands]'' And don't forget to ask us to ''[dolphin chirp]'' the ''[dolphin chirp]'' fries. It will be our ''[dolphin chirp]'' pleasure. ''[Squidward hears the intercom and a giant human ear pops out of his head; he pushes it back in]'' Hi, Squidward, how the ''[dolphin chirp]'' are ya?}}
{{L|Patrick|Nice ''[dolphin chirp]'' day, isn't it, Squidward?}}
{{L|Incidental 6|I don't understand. That guy's talented, he doesn't have to work blue.}}
{{L|Incidental 14|Let's go somewhere more family oriented. ''[Everyone leaves the Krusty Krab, grumbling in frustration]''}}
{{L|Female fish|''[chattering (variously and) inaudibly]'' I'm never eating here again.}}
{{L|Male fish|''[chattering (variously and) inaudibly]'' Those foul-mouth bottom feeders.}}
{{L|''[The Krusty Krab customer meter is running down; sirens wail and a red light flashes]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[in the bathroom, hears the sirens]'' Huh? ''[looks through the periscope, sees that the Krusty Krab is empty and gasps]'' The Krusty Krab, she's empty! ''[runs to dining room with toilet paper stuck to one of his legs]'' All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me beautiful paying customers gone?}}
{{L|Squidward|Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, what was it? What'd he say?}}
{{L|Squidward|Er... he said... um, well he said... ''[whispers the word]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Huh?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[whispers it again]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gasps]'' SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But, Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, it's fancy talk.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|There ain't nothing fancy about that word!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You mean ''[dolphin chirp]''?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes, that one! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick stand up]'' Now quit saying that! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick frown]'' It's a bad word!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Bad word?! ''[both regretfully wipe their tongues while moaning]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.}}
{{L|Squidward|Don't you mean there are only seven?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Not if you're a sailor. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, 13.}}
{{L|Patrick|That's a lot of ''[dolphin chirp]'' bad words.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Okay, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|We promise.}}
{{L|''[later at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are playing ''Eels and Escalators'']''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yea, verily. Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of ''Eels and Escalators.''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, boy, my favorite! ''[Flops arms up and down like a seal]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes! ''[rolls the dice]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Darn. ''[moves game piece to eel]''}}
{{L|Patrick|My turn! ''[rolls dice]'' Hooray! Escalators! ''[laughs excitedly]'' Up, up, up!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators. ''[rolls dice, sighs]'' Eels again.}}
{{L|Patrick|My turn! ''[rolls dice]'' Escalators!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Escalators, Escalators, Escalators! ''[throws dice]'' Eels?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[rolls dice]'' Es-skee-lators! ''[moves to escalators]'' Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gets frustrated while rolling the dice]'' Escalators, escalators, escalators! ''[dice is thrown and lands on escalators]'' Ha! Escalators! ''[dice later turn over to eels]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Eels...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah, ''[dolphin chirp]''! ''[Quickly covers his mouth as he realizes his mistake]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Ooooh...! You said number 11!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[babbles for Patrick to understand]'' I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying... what I meant to say was... some things just slip out. You gotta understand!}}
{{L|Patrick|Don't worry, SpongeBob, I understand. ''[pause]'' Mr. Krabs! ''[runs out the door]'' Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! ''[starts running to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[starts running after him]'' Aah! No, wait, Patrick! ''[after SpongeBob catches up to Patrick]'' Patrick, no, please don't tell!}}
{{L|Patrick|But, you said "''[dolphin chirp]''"! ''[Promptly covers his mouth as he realizes his mistake]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!}}
{{L|Patrick|Not if I tell first!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can run faster than you! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[riding on the back of an ice cream truck]'' See ya at the Krusty Krab! Hahaha! ''[the truck turns left, away from the Krusty Krab's direction]'' Oh, nooooo!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs as he barges into the Krusty Krab]'' Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What, what, what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes, yes, yes?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|He said, he said, he said!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Out with it, boy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[talking fast]'' Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[eyes SpongeBob]'' What kind of things?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, he said...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in a list of 13 words you said shouldn't be said.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uh... right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[walks in door of the Krusty Krab and eats an ice cream cone, but throws away the cone]'' Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs! ''[Mr. Krabs sighs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|He said that word that you said we shouldn't say...!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|...number 13...}}
{{L|''[They babble on about the word, as Mr. Krabs stares on disapprovingly, until the two are just pointing at each other and yelling gibberish; Mr. Krabs eventually grabs their lips to quiet them.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Mmm-hmm. ''[Mr. Krabs lets go of their lips, which initially deflate, then reinflate; they both point at each other again]'' He said "''[dolphin chirp]''"!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gasps]'' Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash. ''[picks SpongeBob and Patrick up by their pants and carries them outside the Krusty Krab]'' You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear: Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back. ''[walks back in Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Patrick|What's going to happen to us?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We'll probably get 40 lashes!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, no! ''[fearfully imagines himself blinking with 40 thick eyelashes]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that.}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm sorry, too, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[shakes hands with SpongeBob]'' Agreed!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[returns with a ladder and several paint cans]'' All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for ''fouling'' the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom. ''[jams his foot on a rock then hops on one leg]'' Ow, Ooh! Ow! My ''[dolphin chirps]'' foot! What ''[dolphin chirps]'' genius put a ''[dolphin chirps]'' rock in a ''[dolphin chirps]'' path?! Can't you see I got a ''[boat horn no. 1]'' foot here?! Oh! ''[seal bark. Continues saying a bunch of swear words, censored out by seagulls, foghorns, ship bells, etc.; at this moment, SpongeBob and Patrick count the swear words he uses]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Five, six, seven...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|...a whole lotta ''[old-style foghorn]'' and with a side of ''[dolphin chirp]'', a heapin' helpin' of ''[ship's bell]'' and a boatload of ''[boat horn no. 4]''...}}
{{L|Patrick|Nine...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs| Ooh ''[seal bark, seagull squawk] ''crabbin' ''[SpongeBob's alarm clock]'' Ooh-hoo-uh! ''[cries in pain]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[cuts to SpongeBob with 13 fingers]'' That's all 13, Patrick! ''[gasps]'' We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[worried]'' No, please, not my mommy! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as they run to Mama Krabs' house, Mr. Krabs runs after them]'' Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!}}
{{L|''[They all arrive at Mama Krabs' house, a giant pink anchor]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[repeatedly banging on the door]'' Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Well, hello there!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs all explain the situation at the same time, swearing numerous times as they do so]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mama Krabs, he said ''[dolphin chirp]'' and then he said ''[dolphin chirps]'' and he said ''[dolphin chirps]'' again and he said ''[seal barks]'', and then he screamed at the top of his voice ''[foghorn blows]''!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[at the same time as the above lines were said]'' It was terrible.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And he--}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[at the same time as the above, angrily]'' Gah, they're a bunch of ''[horn honks]'' liars!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|--Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of ''[seagull caws, foghorn, ship's bell]''--}}
{{L|Patrick|''[crying]'' It was terrible!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|--I have ever heard in my days!}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|''[shocked]'' Oh, dear! My poor old heart. ''[faints]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gasps]'' Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you? ''[takes a coin out of her pocket]'' You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|''[wakes up]'' You should ''all'' be ashamed. And if you're going to talk like sailors, then you're going to ''work'' like sailors.}}
{{L|''[Then the three are painting her house; Patrick is painting the sand]''}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|I guess you scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade. ''[laughs, then stubs her foot on a rock]'' Yeeeoww! My ''[Klaxon horn]'' foot!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick gasp in shock]''}} 
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[shocked]'' Mother!}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|What? It's Old Man Jenkins and his jalopy.}}
{{L|Old Man Jenkins|''[driving by]'' Howdy, Mrs. K! ''[honks the horn]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Mama Krabs|''[all laugh together]''}}
