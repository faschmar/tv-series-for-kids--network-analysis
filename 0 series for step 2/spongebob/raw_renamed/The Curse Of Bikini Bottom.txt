{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick are lying down outside, all bored]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[yawns]'' Oh, I'm bored.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hmmm... Interesting. Me too. Let's go look for something to do in Old Man Squidward's shed!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Old Man Squidward's shed?!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[slowly]'' Yyyeeeeeep!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[sneak inside]'' Ooohhh! ''[they spot Squidward's lawnmower]'' What's that?}}
{{L|Patrick|What is it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know, Patrick.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sighs]'' ''[singing]'' La-da-dee-la-da-dum-la-da-doo, la-da-dee-la-da-dum-la-da-doo! ''[as he walks towards his shed]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[SpongeBob's pretending to drive it and Patrick is imitating it. The door is about to open]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's Old Man Squidward!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hide!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Searches through his gardening tools]'' Where's my trowel?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[whispering]'' SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[whispering]'' Yes, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Is this a trowel? ''[turns to reveal the trowel in his butt]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, Patrick!}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, here it is. ''[reaches for it and screams]'' ''[screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[shouts]'' ''[scream]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't hurt us, Squidward!}}
{{L|Patrick|We're bored!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We just wanted to play with your... ''[looks at lawnmower and points to it]'' ...whatever this thing is.}}
{{L|Squidward|No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! You morons would probably... ''[pauses]'' You want to play with my lawnmower?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!}}
{{L|Squidward|Hmmm... ''[thinking]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[mowing the lawn with Patrick]'' Thanks for letting us mow your lawn, Squidward! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick fall into lawnmower and get cut into pieces offscreen]'' Ahhh! My patty flipping hand! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick sob]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Not thinking. Laughs to himself and starts the lawnmower]'' Knock yourselves out!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick are riding around Squidward's yard on the lawnmower. The lawnmower breaks through the gate and rides straight toward the cemetery. SpongeBob and Patrick giggle]''}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|Excuse me, Davy, I've got my first blind date in 400 years, and I've got to look good. ''[picks a torn shirt]'' It's a little torn. Of course this was the shirt I was buried in. Ahhh, memories! ''[sniffs it]'' Bleah! ''[coughs]'' Okay, that one's a bit ripe. Stained. Too itchy! Hey, there she is! I've been saving this beauty for a special occasion! ''[puts on coat]'' Sssss! Looking good! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick are still riding the lawnmower. The cave ceiling shakes and dirt lands on the Dutchman's clothes. He gets furious]'' Who dares-- ''[gets hit by lawnmower, part of his beard is shaven]'' Who-- ''[gets hit by lawnmower again, more of his beard is cut]'' --disturb-- ''[gets hit a third time, more of his beard is cut]'' --The Flying-- ''[gets hit a fourth time; his beard is now gone]'' --Dutchman?! ''[feels his chin, reveals a mirror, and gasps, noticing his beard is gone]'' My beard! Hey! ''[gets hit by lawnmower and gets livid. He zaps the lawnmower and takes SpongeBob and Patrick off of it]'' Who dares disturb the Flying Dutchman?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[stupidly]'' You're not the Flying Dutchman.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, the Flying Dutchman has a beard.}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|I don't look like the Flying Dutchman, because... ''[lividly enraged and shouting]'' You morons cut off my beard!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[realizing]'' Ooh! It makes you look a thousand years younger.}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|I don't want to look younger! I hate youth! I'll probably get pimples again.}}
{{L|Patrick|Your beard will just grow back.}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|You know nothing about me facial hair. It'll take a thousand years for my beard to grow back! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick now look guilty]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sympathizing]'' I'm sorry. But, we don't know what it's like to be ghosts.}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|Well, now's the time you've learned. Until my beard grows back, I'm going to turn you two fools into ghosts. Prepare to be ghostified! ''[echo]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Ghostified? That's not even a real word.}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|''[zaps SpongeBob and Patrick, but they giggle]'' Okay, you're having too much fun. ''[finishes zapping them as they become ghosts]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[wiggles his ghostly tail]'' We're mermaids.}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|You're ghosts!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Ooh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[to Patrick]'' We're ghosts! ''[with Patrick]'' Yaayyy!}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|This isn't really working out the way I imagined.}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to Squidward watering his garden]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[emerging from beneath and behind Squidward. ghostly moaning voice]'' Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh! Squuiiidwaaarrrd! ''[Squidward looks behind him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Patrick|And Patrick! We're ghoooooooosts! ''[with SpongeBob]'' Ooohhhh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're going to haunt you! Foreeever! ''[with Patrick]'' Oooooohhhâ€”! ''[Squidward sprays them with his hose. normal voice]'' Well, that killed the mood. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the scene]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I knew I shouldn't have lent them my lawnmower.}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition at night]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good night, Patrick. Being a ghost can sure tire ya out!}}
{{L|Patrick|Good night, ghost buddy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gets the key to his door, but it falls through his hand]'' That's odd. However shall I get in? ''[leans on door and falls through it]'' That's handy! ''[yawns]'' I am beat! Well, I don't have to take the stairs! ''[flies straight through the ceiling and into his bedroom, then lies down on his bed]'' Ah. ''[but falls through the bed, the floor, and ends up underground. Bubble transition to morning; SpongeBob exits his house with a very sleepy expression. He then goes to Patrick's house.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[tired]'' Hey, Patrick. I didn't sleep so good last night.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[erratic]'' I didn't sleep at all. I can see through my eyelids. ''[closes his eyes and can see through his eyes; grabs SpongeBob]'' My eyelids!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' I'm late for work!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[whispers]'' My eyelids...}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'm here!}}
{{L|Harold|''[walks by, gets scared of SpongeBob, seeing him as a ghost, and runs out of The Krusty Krab. screams]'' Ahh! Mermaid!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, you're late! Why are you bright green, and what happened to your legs?}}
{{L|Squidward|He's a ghost, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|A ghost, eh? Can you still cook Krabby Patties?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Can do, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Then get your Captain's Quarters in the kitchen!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye, aye, old living employeer! ''[flies through Mr. Krabs and into the kitchen, leaving Mr. Krabs covered in slime]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ewww.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[goes through kitchen door]'' La la la la! ''[grabs the spatula, but it falls through his hand; picks it up, whistles, and breaks it, revealing its spirit; uses it to pick up a Krabby Patty, but it falls through; SpongeBob begins to struggle picking up the patty, but it burns, and disappears; SpongeBob begins to cry]'' I can't cook Krabby Patties! I don't wanna be a ghost anymore, Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't either. I can't eat anything! Food just goes right through me! ''[eats a Krabby Patty, but it falls through him]''}}
{{L|Squidward and Mr. Krabs|Bleah! / Yuck!}}
{{L|Patrick|Maybe the weird hairless man will change us back?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah! Let's go see the Flying Dutchman!}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to the Flying Dutchman's cave, where he is rubbing his chin, which is where his beard used to be]''}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|Well, at least I still have my personality.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[begging]'' Change us back! / Change us back! / We don't like being ghosts! / I don't want to be a ghost! ''[Patrick]'' Change us back! / Change us back! Change us back! / We don't like to be a lie again!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Please, Mr. Dutchman, we can't take it! Constantly moaning and groaning!}}
{{L|Patrick|Invisible to the world!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[starts to cry]'' Living without a soul!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[crying]'' It's miserable!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sobs]'' How could anyone live like this?! ''[cut to Squidward sipping tea. He looks back. He continues]''}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|Hmm, I guess you feel my pain. Well, I'll lift the curse from ya. ''[snaps fingers, but they are still ghosts]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey! We're still ghosts!}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|Yeah, yeah, yeah. The curse will wear off when my beard grows back.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But we want to be normal now!}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|Well, I want to be on my date now! But, you knuckleheads loused that up, too!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're still ghosts, because you can't go on your date?}}
{{L|Patrick|And you can't go on your date because you're ugly?}}
{{L|Both|Makeover!}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to SpongeBob untying the Dutchman's hair and wraps it around his head; Patrick shakes his head; Bubble transition to SpongeBob spreading jelly on the Dutchman's face. Patrick smashes a jellyfish hive and they land on the Dutchman's face; SpongeBob and Patrick shake their heads. Bubble transition; SpongeBob is now on the Flying Dutchman's face]''}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|Thanks, fellas! I love the new beard. Well, I'm off on my date. Don't wait up. ''[he and Patrick laugh as the Dutchman leaves.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't get it...}}
{{L|French Narrator|Several months later...}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick are back to normal and lying on the ground]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, here we are several months later. I wonder how the Flying Dutchman and his new girlfriend are doing.}}
{{L|Flying Dutchman|''[off-screen]'' I can't do it. ''[SpongeBob & Patrick then walk up to the Flying Dutchman, who's beard is restored.]'' ''[on-screen]'' She wants to marry me! I ain't the marrying type. ''[Then, all of a sudden, SpongeBob, Patrick, & the Flying Dutchman hear a mysterious screeching noise, and when the Flying Dutchman turns his head around he sees his date rising from the background.]'' Aaaahhh! ''[runs away]''}}
