{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[Scene starts with Squidward leaving his house on a bicycle while he hums a tune.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go. ''[starts riding his bicycle to work and passes a tall piece of stalk with a treehouse on top of it with SpongeBob and Patrick in it]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[giggling]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wey, wook. It's Widward!}}
{{L|Squidward|What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Widward's woing to work.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[growls]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What's that supposed to be? Some kind of stupid secret code?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron? ''[laughs]'' Moron... ''[laughs again]'' as a requirement. ''[laughs again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!}}
{{L|Squidward|Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[whispering to SpongeBob]'' What did he say?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[whispering to Patrick]'' I don't know. Something about his nose?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[sticks his head out of the "Clubhouse" and talks to Squidward]'' Squidward, you and your nose will definitely not fit in!}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in? ''[takes off his hat and starts to climb up the "Clubhouse"]'' Why, you should be begging me to join!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!}}
{{L|''[Squidward grunts as he tries to get in the "Clubhouse"]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!}}
{{L|Patrick|That's what we've been trying to tell you!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We've been stuck up here for 3 days.}}
{{L|Patrick|We told you you wouldn't fit in.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sneers]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Ready!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[singing]'' Welcome to our club! Welcome to our club! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squid...! }}
{{L|Squidward|Shut your half-wit pieholes! ''[grabs a stalk beside the one holding up the "Clubhouse" and pulls it while the other one is going down]'' I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club! ''[gets to the floor but the stalk snaps and the stalk holding up the "Clubhouse" flings back very fast and the "Clubhouse" flies off it, then starts screaming]''}}
{{L|Nancy|Whoa!}}
{{L|Frank|Make a wish, honey.}}
{{L|''[Squidward continues screaming. The "Clubhouse" falls into the Kelp Forest]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again! ''[victory screech]}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!}}
{{L|Patrick|What happened?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob shrugs. Squidward runs around the "Clubhouse"]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick wave at Squidward who starts crying]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery? Why-y-y-y?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, cheer up, Squid. It could be worse.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah. You could be bald and have a big nose.}}
{{L|''[camera cuts to Squidward's big-nosed and bald head, which deflates]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Well... this is the end. ''[head falls on the ground]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, it's not, Squidward.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[building coffins]'' It's not?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine! ''[patting Squidward's head]'' As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[they do the victory screech again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And besides, we have ''this! [pulls out a conch shell]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What's that?}}
{{L|Patrick|Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married? ''[pulls the string attached to the Magic Conch]''}}
{{L|Magic Conch|Maybe someday.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[giggling]'' Oooohhhh!}}
{{L|Squidward|You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.}}
{{L|Patrick|The shell knows all!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Magic Conch Shell, what do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest? [pulls the string attached to the Magic Conch]''}}
{{L|Magic Conch|Nothing.}}
{{L|Patrick|The shell has spoken!}}
{{L|Squidward|Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting down doing nothing]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[growls]'' I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick still do nothing]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[growls again]'' All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity! ''[starts walking away in the Kelp Forest]'' But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns... ''[laughs]'' sad... ''[laughs again]'' clowns. ''[laughs again. Later, he begins to run fast and grows scared and starts panting rapidly]'' What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost! ''[trips and falls]'' Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here! ''[sees light]'' Huh? ''[laughing. He goes toward the light]'' I'm ''free!'' Take that, SpongeBob and Patrick! ''[pumps fists in the air and starts laughing triumphantly but sees SpongeBob and Patrick]'' Huh? Ohhh... ''[falls on the ground]'' there's no way out of here. ''[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick still doing nothing. A stick is thrown at Patrick's head. Squidward is putting a pan over a fire]'' How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight? ''[spots a bug running around so he steps on it]'' Ah... ''[puts the bug on the pan and walks over to SpongeBob and waves the pan over his nose]'' Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days. ''[walks over to Patrick]'' How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any. ''[walks away from Patrick]'' And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell! ''[shakes his butt in SpongeBob's face]'' If you had listened to me, you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam... ''[moves back to Club Squidward]'' that tells you nothing! ''[stirs the pan]'' As if the answers to all your problems will fall right out of the sky! ''[laughs]'' Fall right out of the sky! ''[camera switches to an airplane falling out of the sky]''}}
{{L|Scooter|Dude, we're falling right out of the sky! We gotta drop the load! ''[presses the "Drop the Load" button. The airplane drops picnic supplies to where SpongeBob and Patrick are]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Praise the Magic Conch! ''[victory screech. Squidward stares shockingly. The bug gets up, hits him with the stick, and runs off. SpongeBob and Patrick eat. SpongeBob eats two hamburgers. Patrick eating a whole turkey in one bite. Now, when SpongeBob and Patrick are drinking, SpongeBob is drinking a can of soda and Patrick is drinking a bottle of ketchup. They laugh and Squidward goes to them]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's a gift from the Magic Conch.}}
{{L|Squidward|Everything sure looks delicious. ''[gasps]'' Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite! ''[smells them but Patrick sucks them in and Squidward's nose too. He pulls his nose out]'' Uh, hey, uh, ''[laughs]'' SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um... ''[stammers; While he is saying all this, SpongeBob is eating a cookie and is drinking a glass of orange juice]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|Umm... uh... yeah?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Once a member, always a member!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[clink glasses]'' To the club! ''[victory screech]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah. ''[mimics the victory screech, weakly]'' Now, uh, if you'll excuse me... ''[runs to the table with all the food]'' What shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why don't you ask... the Magic Conch, Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.}}
{{L|''[Squidward prepares to eat but SpongeBob and Patrick pull the table away and block it]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[whispering]'' Maybe he's not a brother.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob looks at Squidward wide-eyed]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[chuckles]'' Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic. ''[takes the Magic Conch from SpongeBob]'' Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|Neither.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, then how about the soup?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|I don't think so.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[becomes annoyed]'' Could I have anything to eat?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|No.}}
{{L|Squidward|No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[takes the Magic Conch]'' Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|No.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hmm... ''[happily]'' Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|Yes.}}
{{L|Patrick|All right! ''[vacuums in the sandwich and burps]'' Sorry, Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|Give me that! ''[grabs the Magic Conch]'' Could I have something to eat?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|No.}}
{{L|Squidward|Could I have something to eat?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|No.}}
{{L|Squidward|Could I have something to eat?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|No.}}
{{L|Squidward|Can't you say anything else but no?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|Try asking again.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[asks excitedly with a grin on his face]'' Can I have something to eat?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|''[in a very insulting, sarcastic-like tone]'' No.}}
{{L|''[Squidward starts getting enraged]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, are you all right?}}
{{L|''[Squidward shakes his head uncontrollably]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Maybe we should ask the shell if he's ok.}}
{{L|Kelp Forest Ranger|''[offscreen]'' Hello? Anyone there? Hello? Hello?! ''[reveals himself after he cuts through the kelp, then gasps and sees SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward dirty]'' Do you folks need some help?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[gasps]'' I'm saved! ''[runs over to the forest ranger]'' You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!}}
{{L|Kelp Forest Ranger|Magic... Conch Shell? ''[pulls out a Magic Conch Shell]'' You mean like this?! ''[says this while cross-eyed and having two big teeth]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[jump but they stop in midair]'' The Magic Conch! A club member!}}
{{L|Kelp Forest Ranger|''[victory screech]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[victory screech]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[dumbstruck]'' Abra.}}
{{L|Kelp Forest Ranger|My conch told me to come save you guys.}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Patrick and Kelp Forest Ranger|Hooray for the magic conches!}}
{{L|Kelp Forest Ranger|''[we see Squidward in the background looking unhappy]'' All right, Magic Conch... what do we do now?}}
{{L|Magic Conch|Nothing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Kelp Forest Ranger|All hail the Magic Conch! ''[sit down doing nothing, while Squidward, still dumbstruck, moves in between them]''}}
{{L|Squidward|All hail the magic conch! ''[sits down with SpongeBob, Patrick, and the Kelp Forest Ranger]''}}
