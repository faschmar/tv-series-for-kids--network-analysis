{{L|''[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. A customer is giving a creepy smile at Squidward.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Hmm.}}
{{L|''[The customer makes an even more creepier smile.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob! Where are those patties?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Coming right...down, Squidward. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What are you talking about, SpongeBob? Don't you mean coming right up?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mmm...''[points to the ceiling]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I don't see what you're— ''[looks up and sees a patty stuck to the ceiling]''}}
{{L|''[The patty falls down from the ceiling and lands onto Squidward's eyes, burning them and he screams.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nice catch, Squidward! ''[scoops the patty of Squidward's eyes and makes it into a Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Thanks...}}
{{L|''[Suddenly, SpongeBob hears a little boy crying in the dining room. He goes out of the kitchen and hands the customer a patty.]''}}
{{L|Customer|Whoo! ''[chortling and gibbering]''}}
{{L|Little Boy|I want my teddy fish! ''[sobs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ha, ha, all right, don't worry, little boy, we'll find it! ''[to SpongeBob]'' This kid lost his toy. SpongeBob, I need you to check the Lost and Found.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh! I didn't know we had a Lost and Found.}}
{{L|Little Boy|I love my teddy fish! ''[sobbing]''}}
{{L|''[An angry customer gets up and leaves with her sandwich.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You better find it quick, SpongeBob. The kid's bawlin' is chasing me customers away. Follow me, boy-o!}}
{{L|Little Boy|''[bawling continues]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs go into the kitchen. Mr. Krabs opens the door to the Lost and Found and dust flies out, making SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs cough.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Is there a ladder?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes. ''[leaves]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob steps into the Lost and Found and falls into it.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Here's the ladder, boy-o! ''[throws the ladder down to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, I— ''[gets hit by the ladder]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Nice catch!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob struggles to get up but falls over the ladder.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ow!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now, try not to get a bit of anything poisonous!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, nothing, nothing. Good luck!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob sees a box and starts to dig around in it.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, this must be the Lost and Found! ''[looks through the box]'' It's not in here!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Try turning on the lights!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob turns on the lights and sees a huge collection of lost stuff in the Lost and Found.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Wow! Lost umbrellas! Lost flip flops! Lost keys! Lost remotes! Oh! A whole, entire shelf of lost "cool guy" shades! Now, that's a sight for more eyes. ''[laughs as dozens of eyes appear in his holes]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob takes a pair of shades and puts them on.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, no pictures, please. Did you get my good side? ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[A giggle echoes in the background.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What a funny echo. Ha...ha.}}
{{L|''[Another giggle echoes in the background.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gulps]'' Hey! ''[laughs]'' There's bric-a-brac and gee-gaws! ''[gasps]'' I wonder if there's tchotchkes! Oh! Oh! Tchotchkes! Lost novelty items! Wow! ''[his eye widens and covers his entire face]'' I love lost novelty items! ''[takes out false teeth]'' Ooh!}}
{{L|''[The teeth chatters in his arms and shakes SpongeBob, making him step on the whoopee cushions on the floor.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Excuse me! Oh!}}
{{L|''[The chattering teeth make SpongeBob bounce up and down until he grabs a rubber chicken.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob performs a Latin dance with the rubber chicken while stepping on the whoopee cushions. He throws the rubber chicken away.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams and hides in his pants as a real chicken flies over him]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob finishes his Latin dance and cymbal-clapping sea monkeys clap their cymbals.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, thank you, cymbal-clapping sea chimps! ''[notices a snow globe]'' What is this? Looks like Bikini Bottom.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob shakes the snow globe. Suddenly, the entire place rumbles and the people in Bikini Bottom scream as if they are having an earthquake. The shaking stops and SpongeBob nervously puts the snow globe down.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whew! ''[gets hit by a falling box]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|''[Another giggle echoes in the background. Meanwhile, upstairs in the kitchen, Mr. Krabs waits just as Squidward walks in.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey, Mr. Krabs, you know that annoying crying kids?}}
{{L|''[The little boy continues his crying.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|He's still crying...and it's still annoying!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Squidward, I'm glad you're here. I think SpongeBob may be lost in the Lost and Found.}}
{{L|Squidward|And this concerns me how, exactly? ''[gets grabbed by Mr. Krabs]'' Wait—what?! ''[screams as he is thrown into the Lost and Found]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Don't worry. There's a ladder.}}
{{L|''[The little boy's constant crying and screaming even louder begins to destroy by throwing a huge giant tantrum and drive all of the customers crazy.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And find that toy...pronto!}}
{{L|''[Meanwhile in the Lost and Found, SpongeBob wakes up and sees four elderly kids hovering over him.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa! Are you the people of the too-small clothes?}}
{{L|Ginger|No. We were the children, lost in the Krusty Krab over 60 years ago, and we were never claimed.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Did you drop a box on my head?}}
{{L|Ginger|Of course! It's how we say hello.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! ''[throws a box on one of the older kids]'' Hello!}}
{{L|Old Kid #1|''[weakly]'' Hello. ''[moans as he drags away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, no...looks like I'm lost now too.}}
{{L|Ginger|Don't worry. You are found and can live with us now.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How did you survive down here all this time?}}
{{L|Ginger|People leave all kinds of things behind. Like gum. And mints. They leave lots of mints. ''[eats a mint and belches out a horrible breath, which makes SpongeBob dizzy]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Your breath is delightfully fresh.}}
{{L|Ginger|''[claps twice]'' Bring on the welcoming feast!}}
{{L|''[The three older kids runs away and come back with a table filled with stuff made out of candy.]''}}
{{L|Old Kids|Welcoming feast!}}
{{L|''[The candies are shaped like a turkey, a suckling pig, a bottle of wine, and a cornucopia with fruit.]''}}
{{L|Ginger|Dig in!}}
{{L|''[The older kids eat the candied-shaped food. Some of them blew bubbles with the bubble gum while others stuff candy in each others mouth. Ginger goes to give candy to a teddy bear with fins on each side.]''}}
{{L|Ginger|Hey, little dolly. You must be getting hungry! ''[she squeaks the toy]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, hey! That's the teddy fish! My boss, Mr. Krabs, told me to grab that. Thank you!}}
{{L|Ginger|Grr! This? I found it, so...finders keepers.}}
{{L|Old Kids|Finders keepers. Finders keepers.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob taps Ginger's shoulder.]''}}
{{L|Ginger|Huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grabs the toy]'' Yoink! Losers weepers! ''[runs away]''}}
{{L|Old Kid #2|He is using our sacred words against us!}}
{{L|Ginger|That's my teddy fish! Get him!}}
{{L|''[The four older kids chase after SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry, but this has to go back to its rightful owner!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob continues to run. The four older kids try to catch up, but because they are old, they walk slowly gasping and wheezing.]''}}
{{L|Old Kid #2|Run...like the wind...}}
{{L|''[Meanwhile, Squidward is going around the Lost and Found, looking for SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Moron! I mean, SpongeBoooob?! I can't believe Old Man Krabs has held on to all this stuff. ''[notices a box of kazoos]'' Oooh! Kazoos! Why, I had a kazoo when I was a child...}}
{{L|''[A flashback of a younger Squidward is shown.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Everybody loved it!}}
{{L|''[Little Squidward blows threw the kazoo, making music that is off-key. All of the children run out of the school, screaming.]''}}
{{L|School Kid|Oh! Ow! My ears! ''[sobbing]''}}
{{L|''[The flashback ends. Squidward looks through a box and sees clarinets in it.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|These are clarinets! In fact, these are all my clarinets! Wait a minute—these weren't lost! They were all in my locker! Mmm.. ''[hears SpongeBob's panting]'' Now what could that possibly—''[gets run over by SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|''[In slow motion, SpongeBob steps onto Squidward's old clarinets and breaks them as his runs.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[groans and sees the broken clarinets]'' Typical.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs looking through the Lost and Found door.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Squidward? SpongeBob? It's the curse of the Lost and Found: no one ever gets found. They just stay lost. ''[closes the door]'' Oh, well, back to work.}}
{{L|Little Boy|Waaah!}}
{{L|Customer|The ambiance in this place stinks! ''[leaves]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gasps]'' Stinky ambiance? Oooh, it's a dark time for the Krusty Krab.}}
{{L|Little Boy|Waaaah!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Waaaaah!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob continues to run away from the older kids.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! Lost toys! ''[almost gets hit by a toy arrow and screams, then he pants as he jumps on a scooter]''}}
{{L|''[The older kids ride on tricycles and skateboards as they chase SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|Ginger|Get him!}}
{{L|''[One of the older kids rides on a pogo stick, but falls over. Another older kids rides up to SpongeBob and throws jacks and balls on the floor, making SpongeBob fall over.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Lost Toilets? ''[hops on a toilet and rides off]''}}
{{L|''[The older kids ride on toilets as they chase SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|Ginger|We need more speed!}}
{{L|''[The older kids flush the toilets to go faster. SpongeBob manages to slow them down by getting them tangled with toilet paper, causing them to crash into each other.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Lost Pets! ''[gasps and whimpers]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob continues to run as the older kids chase him on snails.]''}}
{{L|Older Kid #2|Hyah! Hyah! Mush! Mush!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and the older kids ride through a mine as miners dig up jewelry.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Lost Mine!}}
{{L|''[The older kids throw diamonds at SpongeBob, but he deflects them back with his spongy body. Then, SpongeBob is seen riding on a Tylosaurus  in the prehistoric lost world.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Lost world!}}
{{L|''[The older kids ride on the back of a Tanystropheus as they chase SpongeBob. The scene changes to Squidward continuing to look for SpongeBob. However, he looks up and sees a hatch on the ceiling.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|A hatch! Maybe that's the emergency exit! ''[opens it and grease rains down on him]'' Grease trap!?}}
{{L|''[Squidward gets caught in the torrent of grease and screams helplessly. SpongeBob is still being chased by the older kids until he reaches a dead end.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Lost dead ends?! ''[mutters and whimpers]''}}
{{L|''[The older kids corner SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|Ginger|Give us the teddy fish!}}
{{L|Old Kids|Teddy fish! Teddy fish!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No! This teddy fish belongs to a poor, sweet child! ''[notices grease on the floor]'' Huh? ''[licks the grease]'' Patty grease? Oh, no! I haven't cleaned the grease trap in years!}}
{{L|Old Kids|Oh, no.}}
{{L|Ginger|Quick! Get on each other's shoulders.}}
{{L|''[The older kids make a ladder as they climb on their shoulders.]''}}
{{L|Ginger|''[climbs on them]'' At least some of us will survive.}}
{{L|Old Kid #1|Aw, come on!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait! I have a better idea! ''[whistles]''}}
{{L|''[Upstairs, Mr. Krabs and the little boy continue to wail.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No SpongeBob, no teddy fish, no customers! ''[sobbing]'' All is lost!}}
{{L|''[A knock is heard on the door.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sniffles]'' Who is it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Tylo!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Tylo who? ''[gasps as SpongeBob opens the door with a Tylosaurus]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Tylosaurus!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! Thank Neptune you're back, son!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, good to be back Mr. Krabs, but I'm not the only one. Look who I found!}}
{{L|''[Ginger comes up the door.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ack! ''[hits Ginger with SpongeBob]'' Get back! Get back!}}
{{L|Ginger's mother|Ginger? Is that you?}}
{{L|Ginger|Mom? What are you doing here?}}
{{L|Ginger's mother|We come here every week.}}
{{L|Ginger|"We?"}}
{{L|Ginger's mother|Yes. Myself and your father and the other parents of kids who were lost here. Where were you?}}
{{L|Ginger|In the Lost and Found!}}
{{L|Ginger's mother|''[stutter]'' There's a Lost and Found?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hm. Maybe I should put up a sign.}}
{{L|''[Ginger and the older kids hug their older parents as they are happily reunited.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aww, all the old people are hugging. ''hugs Mr. Krabs}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs pats SpongeBob for doing a good job of reuniting the families.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Dry your tears, little kid. Look! It's teddy fish! ''[gives the kid his toy]''}}
{{L|Little Boy|I don't want that anymore!}}
{{L|''[The little boy throws the teddy fish. Ginger catches the toy.]''}}
{{L|Ginger|Huh? ''[hugs the toy]'' Hmm.}}
{{L|Little Boy|I want this! ''[rides on the Tylosaurus]'' Whaaa-hoo!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, I guess we all learned a lesson about being lost and being found today.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's that, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I don't know.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, speaking of lost, where's Squidward?}}{{L|''[Squidward, who is still in the Lost and Found, screams as he is being swept away in a river of the lost world. He blows the kazoo and continues to scream and even bawl uncontrollably as the Tylosaurus and Tanystropheus swim and stomp over him respectively.]''}}
