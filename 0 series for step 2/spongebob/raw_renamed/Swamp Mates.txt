{{L|''[The episode begins with SpongeBob talking to Gary in his library.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you ready for a bedtime story, Gary?}}
{{L|Gary|''[goes into his shell and pops out wearing a night hat and yawns]'' Meow, meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[twists around his chair and starts wearing a fancy outfit]'' Good evening, Gary, and welcome to Pat-Star-Piece Theatre. ''[sips his pipe while bubbles come out of it]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Patrick is shown on a high wheel bicycle drinking tea in front of a red stage with Pat-Star-Piece Theatre written in red. There are two trumpets blowing as well.]'' Hot, hot, hot! ''[Patrick falls off the bicycle.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pulling his mustache]'' Hmm. ''[picks out a book]'' Would you like to hear an exciting story about Great Sir Patrick and the Fire-Breathing Dragon? ''[he opens the book and gets burned by the contents inside.]''}}
{{L|Gary|''[scared]'' Meow. ''[shaking his head]'' Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[closes the book, cleans his face and puts the book back on the shelf]'' Or perhaps a thrilling tale of explorer Patrick on safari in the jungle! ''[a lion head comes out of the book and roars at SpongeBob, scaring him while Gary hides in his shell. Once he closes it, SpongeBob pants heavily]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow, meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[puts the book inside a cage]'' Ah! ''[he picks out a book called "Swamp Mates." He blows on the dust and goes to his chair]'' This is a good one. "Swamp Mates," a story of two buffoons in a bog. ''[he and Gary laugh. SpongeBob opens the book, disgusted by the amount of bugs there are on it]'' Gee. Once upon a time, there was a saucy superhero with a prognathous posterior, and they called him ''[SpongeBob turns the page where Bubble Bass is shown]'' Bubble Bass.}}
{{L|''[the scene changes to the First Nautical Bank, with Man Ray running outside with a loot of cash]''}}
{{L|Bank guard|''[points to Man Ray]'' Stop, thief!}}
{{L|''[Bubble Bass is seen in his plane targeting Man Ray and obtaining his information. He hits the eject button and goes in mid-air. He smashes his posterior onto Man Ray, and at that moment the Anchor Man pauses the video.]''}}
{{L|Anchor Man|Excellent job capturing Man Ray last week, Bubble Bass!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Thank you, Anchor Man, ''[he sits up]'' he was no match for my ''[shows his posterior to the crew, with dumbbells on them]'' mighty heinie! ''[starts lifting the dumbbells with his posterior, while Anchor Man and the others look with interest. After finishing, he clears his throat]'' I call this meeting of the Guild of Obsessive Fans, aka G.O.O.F.S ''[shows his G.O.O.F.S uniform]'' to order, fellow heroes! Let us welcome our newest member, Wonder Whale! ''[her chair is shown to be empty. Suburban Dad looks concerned about this. Bubble Bass clicks his mouth and looks at his watch]'' It would appear Wonder Whale is late.}}
{{L|The Chief|''[The Chief appears on the screen after a ringing sound occurs]'' Heroes!}}
{{L|Anchor Man|''[he salutes]'' It's the chief!}}
{{L|The Chief|Wonder Whale isn't late, she's been kidnapped! By the avarice snare dwell, Hoodoo Guru, the voodoo villain!}}
{{L|''[The heroes start gasping in disbelief. An anchor drops on Anchor Man's foot, then Bubble Bass shows his abs]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Don't worry Chief! We'll rescue Wonder Wha-}}
{{L|Mama Bass|''[knocks on his door, revealing this whole sequence just to be an imagination]'' Bubble Bass?!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Mother?! ''[His stomach fat slaps on the table]''}}
{{L|The Chief|''[screams]'' Your mother! ''[gets his hand out of the screen to turn it off, then disappearing into static]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[grunts and groans as his fantasy is interrupted as he is in his mother's basement]''}}
{{L|Mama Bass|''[from across the room]'' Why don't you go outside and make some real friends?}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Mother, you know direct sunlight gives me gas. ''[burps loudly]'' Besides, I'm busy looking for my Wonder Whale... ''[looks under the couch]'' action figure.}}
{{L|Mama Bass|I knew you'd say something like that.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[angered]'' Why you...}}
{{L|Mama Bass|So your mother has scheduled ''a playdate'' for you.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|I'm ''not'' 23 anymore, mother! You'll just have to cancel it!}}
{{L|Mama Bass|Too late, your new friend is already here. Have ''fun''!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[walks up the stairs and hears knocking, then opening the door to reveal Patrick at the entrance]'' Huh?!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey buddy! Ready for our playdate? ''[squeezes Bubble Bass into a tight hug]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[slaps Patrick and picks him up to scold him]'' I will not associate with such a dimwitted doofus.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[flattered]'' Aw, you're just ''saying'' that!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[angered by his stupidity]'' Ugh! ''[Throws Patrick back outside of the room and slams the door on him, create a dent in the shape of his body through the door]'' Ugh! ''[gasps to see Patrick somehow found his way into the basement despite being thrown out with the door being closed]'' What?!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[laughing as he is playing with his Man Ray and Anchor Man action figures, then chews on the Man Ray one]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[snatches the figurine out of his hand]'' Put those down! ''[Takes the rest of the action figures on the table and hugs them in protection]'' My ''poor'' things. But don't worry, daddy will protect you.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[starts chewing on the Anchor Man figure]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[snatches the figure out of his mouth]'' You've completely chewed up my limited-edition Anchor Man! ''[A close-up is shown of the action figure in a chewed stated covered with saliva. Bubble Bass then groans]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Sorry! I'm teething. ''[A close-up is shown of Patrick's one tooth and his deteriorated gums pounding]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[groans as his head start to release smoke due to anger]''}}
{{L|Patrick|So... What do you want to do for our ''playdate''? ''[Wraps his arm around Bubble Bass' neck]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[pushes Patrick aside]'' I have no time for a cretin like you. I must find my Wonder Whale action figure. ''[Walks off to find it]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[gets excited and starts making an amused face]'' Oh? Oh! I'll help you look! ''[Lifts a box upside down filled with other toys and skims through the pile, then throwing some of the toys at the wall]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Stop it you clod! ''[Walks over to confront him]'' Do not touch ''any'' of my property!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh! That's okay! We can play with ''my'' game. ''[Takes out a gigantic bag from his pants and jumps onto it, which leaks out green liquid]'' Let's play swamp! ''[Opens up the bag to reveal more of the green liquid, which he then pours on the ground as it floods the basement]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[gasps and becomes repulsed]'' Wait, stop! What are you doing?! ''[Screams as Patrick creates a flooding. The action figures get lost in the flooding, but Bubble Bass manages to catch some of them]'' No! My precious babies!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hehe, no problem! I'll fix it! ''[Flushes the toilet but it causes the swamp liquid to flush down]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[notices his Wonder Whale action figure in the swamp liquid]'' My Wonder Whale! ''[Runs to catch it before it is too late]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I got it! ''[Tries to catch it but misses. Hangs onto the toilet so he does not get sucked into the liquid, where the toy is heading]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[hangs onto the back of Patrick's short as Patrick hangs onto the toilet seat, which then detaches as both of them get sucked into the drain and find themselves in a swamp forest. After the screen turns to black, Bubble Bass is shown sticking his head out from the swamp pool with the toilet seat around his neck]'' Wonder Whale! Where are you? ''[Is about to drown into the liquid]'' I. Require. Assistance! ''[Sinks into the swamp pool]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I got you, playdate partner! ''[Grabs Bubble Bass by the head to save him from drowning. Patrick then starts to lose balance and slips continuously on the log, causing Bubble Bass to spin in circles]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[coughs up liquid as he slowly regains consciousness]'' Where am I? ''[Becomes nervous as he hears an owl howling and looks around]'' By the enchanted spatula of Suburban Dad... We're in a real swamp! ''[Notices the toilet seat around his neck]'' Ew! Why am I wearing this collar of shame?!}}
{{L|Patrick|I think it looks good on you.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[removes the toilet seat from his neck and throws it into the lake]'' Eugh! I ''despise'' nature.}}
{{L|Patrick|Aww you just haven't given it a chance. Smell that swamp air! ''[Patrick inhales deeply and gets a lot of plants and a few firefly-like jellyfish stuck inside his nose, then sneezes them out as the firejellies fly into Bubble Bass' mouth and sting him constantly before flying out and giving him a tongue blister]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[looks at his stung tongue]'' My tongue! ''[Notices Patrick drinking a cup of what seems to be water]'' Water! Give me water! ''[Takes Patrick's cup and drinks it, but then spits it out in disgust over realizing it is not water, but rather the swamp goo]'' Ew! Where did you get this disgusting liquid?!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[drags his cup through the swamp goo and turns its upside down as the solid liquid gets into his mouth. He then swallows the goo]'' Ah. Slimy ''and'' refreshing.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|This can't be happening. ''[Preaches out loud]'' This place is a nightmare! ''[Sobs]'' I'll never find my Wonder Whale action figure. ''[They then hear an evil guy laughing and see his shadow behind one of the plants. Both Bubble Bass and Patrick gasp]'' What is that? ''[The guy is then revealed to have stolen Bubble Bass' Wonder Whale action figure]'' My Wonder Whale! That crook stole my precious possession! ''[Points his finger at him]'' Get him!}}
{{L|Patrick|Are we playing tag? I love tag! ''[Jumps off the log and onto the sand with Bubble Bass. Puts his dirt-covered hand on Bubble Bass' face]'' Tag you're it! Hahaha! ''[The man then takes off with Bubble Bass' action figure]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|After him! ''[He and Patrick run to chase the villain. Patrick trips over some rocks and lands his face into Bubble Bass' butt]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Where'd he go?}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Perhaps he's in that dilapidated dwelling. ''[points to an old shack house]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Doubt it. Maybe he's in that ''shack''? ''[Points to it. Bubble Bass is angered by his stupidity. They then look through the window of the shack to reveal a blue and green alligator, the blue one pouring peppers into a machine]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Hmph. It's just some uncouth natives. ''[Both he and Patrick get grabbed by the heads by a purple alligator]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hello! ''[He and Bubble Bass then get thrown into the shack]''}}
{{L|Buford|I caught these two a peepin' through the window.}}
{{L|Cletus|They're thieves! Trying to steal our illegal hot sauce.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Illegal?}}
{{L|Luther|Our swamp sauce is so spicy, it can blow your head clean off.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|I assure you we are not interested in your disgusting hot sauce.}}
{{L|Cletus|Then what's he doing?}}{{L|Patrick|''[gulps the bucket of hot sauce, and his head explodes from his body and makes a steam sound, and his head falls into Bubble Bass' arms]'' Huh. You call that spicy? ''[burps out flames, causing the nearby equipment to catch on fire]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[aiming Patrick's head at the alligators]'' Back off, you backwater bumpkins! Run!}}
{{L|Cletus|After 'em, boys! You ain't a-gettin' away that easy!}}
{{L|Luther|Yee-ha.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Ha, too slow, you cold-blooded clowns. Those Crocs are catching up with us!}}
{{L|Patrick|That hot sauce has already caught up with me.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|That's it!}}
{{L|Cletus|What?!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|So, play date partner. What are we supposed to do now? Hmm?}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Give me back my Wonder Whale!}}
{{L|Hoodoo Guru|Huh?}}
{{L|Patrick|Huh? Hey, wait for me, buddy!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Come back here. You'll swing for this, you ruffian!}}
{{L|Hoodoo Guru|I am afraid you are the ones who will swing. You ignoramuses fell right into my trap!}}
{{L|Patrick|Technically, I'm a doofus.}}{{L|Bubble Bass|Hoodoo Guru the Voodoo Villain? He's real!}}
{{L|Hoodoo Guru|That's right, Bubble Bass, and your precious Wonder Whale is all mine.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|I dread to think what horrific ritual you will use it for.}}
{{L|Hoodoo Guru|Huh? Ritual, shmitual! I just needed it to complete my collection.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Stealing from a fellow collector? That's despicable! I will thrash you, sir! Can't break out.}}
{{L|Patrick|You're probably weak from hunger. Here, try some of this spaghetti.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Mmm! Glorious caloric intake! Wherever did you find it?}}
{{L|Patrick|We're sitting on it!}}
{{L|Hoodoo Guru|Ouch.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Ha ha! Evil never triumphs against a truly obsessive fan!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah! Evil never triumphs over a oscillating fan!}}
{{L|Hoodoo Guru|Not so fast, Bubble Bass. I've got one more trick up my sleeve. Or should I say, up my glove!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|A Patrick Star action figure? Ha! No collector would touch such trash.}}
{{L|Patrick|Plus, it's a choking hazard. What's going on?}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|That fiend, Hoodoo, is using his magic voodoo doll powers.}}
{{L|Patrick|Sorry.}}
{{L|Hoodoo Guru|I'll take that.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Stop! I'm allergic to centrifugal force!}}
{{L|Hoodoo Guru|Uh-oh.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Ha! I'll return this to its rightful owner. Me.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well done, pal.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Eww.}}
{{L|Buford|Hey, Luther, Cletus, I found them fellers what blowed up our still!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, hi!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|No, our only escape! If only I had something large and buoyant.}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know what that means, but... Hop on, friend!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Friend?}}
{{L|Patrick|Sure, you're my play date, right, buddy?}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Buddy?}}
{{L|Hoodoo Guru|It's over, Bubble Bass! Give up!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|You will never win, Hoodoo, because we have the power of reluctant friendship! Yeah, that's right. Run away from our righteous acquaintance!}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh, they might be running from that.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|What happened?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, you were dead for like 10 minutes.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Oh, it was all just a hallucination? Then my Wonder Whale action figure is still missing.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, you may have lost your toy, but you've gained an indoor pool! Congratulations!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|My precious Wonder Whale!}}
{{L|Mama Bass|Bubble Bass! What did you do to my basement?}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Perhaps the swamp wasn't so bad after all. [dives into the water]}}
{{L|Patrick|Best playdate ever! ''[dives into the water too]''}}
{{L|The Chief|Whoo-hoo! This completes my collection.}}
