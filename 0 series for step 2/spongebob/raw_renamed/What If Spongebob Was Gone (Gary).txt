{{L|French Narrator|What if SpongeBob was gone?}}
{{L|''[the alarm clock blows when it moves and falls out of the window, Gary wakes up and looks at SpongeBob's bed noticing that SpongeBob isn't there anymore]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow? ''[He runs downstairs and pushes the TV the furniture and moves the furniture and everything else until they're on top of the table, scene cuts to night-time when the moon comes up, Gary and all the other snails are having a party until they notice the stuff Gary moved and an alarm clock coming into the room, the alarm clock hits everything, Gary meows sadly but the alarm blows at him]''}}
