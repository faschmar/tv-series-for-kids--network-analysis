{{L|''[Mr. Krabs reclines in his chair in a white tank top and underwear, fast asleep. Pearl walks up to him angrily]''}}
{{L|Pearl|''[yelling]'' Unacceptable!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[wakes up]'' Pearl?!}}
{{L|Pearl|My friends will be here in twenty minutes for my slumber party, and you're laying around in your tighty-no-longer-whities.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|A man works hard all week to keep his pants off all weekend!}}
{{L|Pearl|If you trusted me, you would leave for the night.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs, causing corn chips to come out of his nose]'' You make Corn Crunch come out me nose!}}
{{L|Pearl|Dad!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gets out of his chair]'' Look, I'll stay upstairs in me room and not interrupt.}}
{{L|Pearl|You promise?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I promise.}}
{{L|Pearl|Good night, daddy. ''[giggles]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Good night, sweetie. ''[goes upstairs. Pearl walks to the refrigerator, and finds Mr. Krabs chaining it up]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Dad!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, hi, pumpkin. I was just setting out refreshments for you and your friends. ''[hands her a tray with crackers and a glass of water on it]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Crackers and tap water? You are the cheapest crab alive!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now, don't say that. ''[holds up a wallet full of cash]'' Here, would your friends like some pizza?}}
{{L|Pearl|Well, yeah. Yeah, we would.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Okay, you can have your allowance early. ''[pulls some ketchup packets out of the wallet]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Ketchup?!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|See, you put it on the crackers... ''[does so]'' and a mamma mia, you got-a one-a spicy pizza pie-a! ''[eats some of it; Pearl grabs him furiously]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Okay, okay, I'm going. ''[Pearl flings him into his room. Suddenly, she hears knocking from outside]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Oh! Oh! ''[laughs]'' They're here! ''[rushes outside]'' Hi! ''[finds Mr. Krabs nailing a large sign to the front of the house]'' Dad?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Just putting up the house rules.}}
{{L|Pearl|''[reading from the sign]'' No dancing... no loud music after 7:30... no touching the root beer cellar?!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And the most important one of all... ''[pulls a switch that activates a large neon sign reading "NO BOYS ALLOWED"]'' No boys allowed! Isn't it glorious? ''[Pearl leaves and locks the door on him; he tugs on the door handle]'' Sweetie? You accidentally locked the door.}}
{{L|Pearl|You're not coming back in this house until after my slumber party is over!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gasps]'' This is mutiny!}}
{{L|Pearl|What are you gonna do about it? Take away my allowance? ''[throws the crackers with ketchup at him]'' Here you go!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Open this door or I'll...}}
{{L|''[The neon sign shorts out, along with all the other lights in Bikini Bottom. We hear clamoring from the citizens. Cut to SpongeBob's house, where Mr. Krabs is talking to SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You wanna stay here? At my house? With me? ''[looks excited]'' }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What do you say, boy? }}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[jumps into the air in exhilaration]'' Yee-hee! Slumber party!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Maybe I should just sleep under the highway. }}
{{L|''[Cut to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob sitting near the TV in sleeping bags]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We can stay up really, really late! ''[shines a flashlight on his face]'' And tell ghost stories! ''[shows Mr. Krabs his socks]'' And trade socks! }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Is that what girls do at slumber parties?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No. They invite boys over and destroy the house!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|They what?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You know how girls are.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uh, SpongeBob, do you know anything about girls?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Do I know any... no. But Gary does. ''[we see Gary reading a magazine, sitting next to the remote]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow. ''[turns on the TV]''}}
{{L|TV Announcer|We now return to tonight's scary movie: "Slumber Party Zombie Attack." ''[the movie features a group of girls having a pillow fight]''}}
{{L|TV Girl|Pillow fight! ''[the girls giggle]'' That tickles! ''[someone throws a pillow at some furniture and breaks it]'' Missed me!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gasps]'' Look what they're doing to that man's house!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, it's only a mov...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[silences him]'' Quiet, boy! }}
{{L|TV Girl|Boys are here! }}
{{L|TV Boy #1|''[walks in with two other boys flanking him]'' Hi, girls. I brought my destructive friends.}}
{{L|TV Boy #2|Nice to... ''[breaks a model boat with a crowbar]'' meet you! }}
{{L|TV Boy #1|Ha! Destroying other people's possessions is fun! ''[the boys break a lamp, some tupperware and a piggy bank, and then set fire to the money inside. This frightens Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[shrieks]'' Turn it off! Turn it off! I can't take it! ''[hides in his sleeping bag]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't think this is the scary part yet.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I said turn it off! ''[destroys the TV with a baseball bat]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gosh, Mr. Krabs. I never knew you were scared of zombies.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Not zombies, you barnacle brain! Teenagers.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Zombie teenagers?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No! Pearl and her no-good friends! They're probably destroying me house right now! Like this. ''[knocks over a potted plant]'' Oops! I don't care, it's not mine. ''[picks up SpongeBob's family picture]'' Oh, look! One of the homeowner's most prized possessions! ''[throws it over his shoulder]'' La-dee-da... }}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[goes over to the bookshelf]'' Ooh, this'll be fun to destroy! ''[knocks the shelf over and it crushes SpongeBob]'' Whee! ''[SpongeBob's head pops out of the bookshelf]'' Now do you get it, boy?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I do, Mr. Krabs. It must be horrible to invite people into your home and have them treat your property with so little respect! }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That's what teenagers do! Do you want this to happen to my house?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gosh, no, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[lifts him up by his head]'' Then get into Pearl's party and find out what they're doing! }}
{{L|SpongeBob|Leave it to me, Mr. K. I've got the perfect disguise.}} 
{{L|''[Cut to Pearl's room, where Pearl and her friends are reading magazines and laughing. There is a knock at the door. Pearl answers it]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Hello? ''[A female sponge is there with her suitcase]''}}
{{L|Girly Teengirl|Hi, I'm here for the slumber party.}}
{{L|Pearl|Do I know you?}}
{{L|Girly Teengirl|My name is... um... Girly Teengirl.}}
{{L|Pearl|''[suspiciously]'' Uh-huh.}}
{{L|Girly Teengirl|Um, I just moved here from... um... Farawayville.}}
{{L|Pearl|I know it's you, SpongeBob SquarePants!}}
{{L|Girly Teengirl|I don't know what you're talking about. ''[Pearl grabs her by the hair and lifts her up; Girly screams]'' }}
{{L|Pearl|You were sent to spy on me by my dad! Get him, girls!}}
{{L|''[Girly screams again. Cut to Girly running away in tears while the girls throw fruit at her]''}}
{{L|Girly|''[crying]'' I am so moving back to Farawayville! ''[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs drive up in a pizza delivery truck]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Who the heck is that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know, but she is ugly! Now to put on that disguise I told you about. ''[puts on a fake mustache]'' Ta-dah! Huh? Huh? Huh?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You are one of a kind, boy. ''[SpongeBob knocks on the door of Mr. Krabs' house, holding a pizza box]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Pizza delivery.}}
{{L|Pearl|We didn't order any pizza!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Y-You didn't?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, tell them it's from me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Your dad sent it. It's already paid for.}}
{{L|Pearl|''[opens the door]'' I'd sooner believe space aliens sent me a free pizza before I'd believe my dad would! Now, who are you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um... uh... ''[his mustache flies away, singing like a bird]'' Hey!}}
{{L|Pearl|SpongeBob?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|They're on to us, Mr. Krabs! Drive!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Right, boy! ''[SpongeBob makes a dash for the truck, but Mr. Krabs drives off without him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I wanted to come with you, Mr. Krabs. ''[the girls grab him]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Get him! ''[SpongeBob screams as the girls pull him inside and he drops the pizza box, showing that there is no pizza inside]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Oh, big surprise. Dad was too cheap to buy real pizza!}} 
{{L|''[Cut back to SpongeBob's house, Mr. Krabs is digging through a trunk in his bedroom]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What's taking SpongeBob so long? I'm getting tired of looking through his stuff. ''[there is a knock at the door; he answers it]'' Hello? ''[sees the pizza box]'' Pizza! ''[opens it, only to find SpongeBob in the shape of a pizza]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I failed you.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I know, son. ''[takes a slice of SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Mr. Krabs, that's my eye!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[bites the slice, then spits it out]'' And it's ice cold, too. You should have been back here in 30 minutes or less! ''[takes another slice. At Mr. Krabs and Pearl's house, the girls are playing a board game. There's a knock on the door]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Who is it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[disguised]'' Piano repair man! ''[The girls are giggling]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Okay! We'll be right out!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, it's working! ''[Pearl and her friends drop the piano on him from the roof]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Have it back by tomorrow. Okay?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[squashed]'' Maybe we should leave them alone, Mr. Krabs. They seem pretty trustworthy.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You get into that party, or you're fired!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, Mr. Krabs. ''[There is another knock on the door of Pearl and Mr. Krabs' house]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Whoever could it be this time?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's me, SpongeBob SquarePants. Can we talk, Pearl? Whale to sponge?}}
{{L|Pearl|''[to her friends on the roof]'' Hold the boiling oil! ''[Her friends groan]'' What do you want, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[crying]'' Oh, please let me stay at your party! Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please!}}
{{L|Pearl|No!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Give me one good reason why I can't stay!}}
{{L|Pearl|I can give you a hundred million billion reasons!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeesh, I only asked for one.}}
{{L|Pearl|Reason number one: you're just like my dad!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Really?!}}
{{L|Pearl|A no-good, dried-up, old fuddy-duddy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So if I prove I'm fun, can I stay?}}
{{L|Pearl|Sure, SpongeBob. If you can prove you're the most fun person on the planet in the next ten seconds, you could stay.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I only need eight! ''[runs inside]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoo! Party! ''[cranks up the record player]'' Crank it up!}}
{{L|Pearl|Five seconds.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|These old newspapers are confetti in fun hands! Whoo!}}
{{L|Girl 1|I'm allergic to newsprint! ''[starts blotching]'' Oh, ow!}}
{{L|Pearl|Two seconds! ''[opens up a trap door to Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar. SpongeBob falls inside]'' Okay, okay, I got to admit. That was kinda fun.}}
{{L|Girl 2|I think he's hurt.}}
{{L|Pearl|He's not hurt. ''[SpongeBob groans]'' See?}}
{{L|Girl 2|Maybe he's a zombie!}}
{{L|Girl 1|If he comes back as a zombie and eats my brain, I'm totally not going to be your friend anymore! ''[Pearl closes the trap door]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[recovers]'' Ooh, Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar. Fun! ''[opens all the root beer kegs which fills up the cellar. He absorbs it all. Upstairs, the girls are watching the same movie that him and Mr. Krabs were watching]''}}
{{L|TV Announcer|We now return to Slumber Party Zombie Attack!}}
{{L|Girl on TV|''[screams]'' A zombie! ''[A slimy, ugly thing appears on screen]''}}
{{L|Pearl|This movie isn't all that scary!}}
{{L|Girl 1|Yeah, that zombie looks totally fake! ''[The trap door creaks open, and the girls look. SpongeBob emerges enormous and dripping with root beer, similar to the one on TV]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gurgling]'' Party!}}
{{L|Girls|''[screams]'' Zombie!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Fun! ''[squirts root beer out of his body]''}}
{{L|Girl 3|''[screams and gets soaked by root beer and falls down]''}}
{{L|Girl 4|Zombie juice! ''[gets blasted and falls down]''}}
{{L|Girl 5|''[screams]'' Run!}}
{{L|Pearl|''[screams as she narrowly avoids a root beer blast, which soaks some knick-knacks. Root beer starts pouring out of the windows with random girls sliding out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gurgling]'' Who wants to dance?}}
{{L|Girl 6|No! I already have a zombie boyfriend!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's boogie! Whoo! ''[starts spinning two girls in circles and get thrown out of windows. The house keeps spewing more soda and eventually breaks the door down. The spewing stops as Mr. Krabs pops onto the scene]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What in Neptune's toupee is going on here? ''[gasps and screams]'' Me knick-knacks! ''[screams]'' Me root beer! ''[walks past Pearl]'' Me pile of old newspapers! ''[crying]'' I was maybe gonna read that someday! ''[to Pearl]'' I knew I shouldn't have trusted you!}}
{{L|Pearl|Trusted me?! Your ''employee'' destroyed this house! ''[picks up SpongeBob from inside the record player]'' The only ''boy'' at the party!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[normal voice]'' Well, Mr. Krabs, you know how boys are. ''[Pearl drops him]'' Ow!}}
{{L|Pearl|''[to Mr. Krabs]'' It's your fault my party is ruined, and all my friends have zombie shock syndrome!}}
{{L|Girl 6|''[rocking back and forth]'' I'm too pretty to be a zombie!}}
{{L|Pearl|We were fine with a nice simple slumber party. But now, it's gonna cost you!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Cost me what?!}}
{{L|Pearl|''[sinister hiss]'' Money....!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Nooo!}}
{{L|''[At Goo Lagoon, a party is being held by Pearl. There are many people there]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Everyone having a good time? ''[crowd cheering]'' Well, you can all thank my dad for making this possible! Thank you, Daddy! ''[Mr. Krabs is far away behind a velvet rope. A boss hog is watching him]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You're welcome, sweetie! ''[leaning on a rope]'' Oh, this is so expensive!}}
{{L|Boss Hog|You're not allowed any closer, sir. ''[SpongeBob appears]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, I think I know what'll cheer you up. ''[puts a drinking glass under his armpit and squirts some root beer into it]'' A mug of ice cold root beer!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No, SpongeBob, that doesn't cheer me up at all!}}
