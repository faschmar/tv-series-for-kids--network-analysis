*'''Painty:''' Are you ready, kids?
*'''Kids:''' Aye, aye, captain!
*'''Painty:''' ''[as he pops out of his painting]'' I can't hear you!
*'''Kids:''' Aye, aye, captain! ''[Painty's arms pop out of the picture]''
*'''Painty:''' Good! In you go! ''[Painty pushes the audience into Bikini Bottom as the instrumental SpongeBob SquarePants theme song plays. The audience flies through Bikini Bottom.]''
*'''Mr. Krabs:''' SpongeBob, me boy! It's time to give them a crash course in Krabby Patty making! ''[The audience crashes into The Krusty Krab's kitchen and the show starts now.]''
*'''SpongeBob:''' Welcome, trainee! ''[He runs to a counter with the Krabby Patty ingredients and pulls down a chart with the ingredients]'' The foundation of the Krabby Patty is as follows: bun, lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce, and secret recipe patty.
*'''Mr. Krabs:''' ''[popping up on the side of the screen]'' Trademarked by Mr. Krabs! ''[Krabs vanishes from the side of the screen as SpongeBob pulls the chart up and a Krabby Patty falls into his hand]''
*'''SpongeBob:''' But like anything in life, it's not complete without a pickle. ''[shakes out a slice of pickle from a mini pickle barrel]'' Hey! The last one! ''[opens the Krabby Patty]'' Come on, little fella. Fulfill your destiny. ''[The pickle slips out into the audience as SpongeBob tries to grab it. Sandals is shown waiting for his Krabby Patty at the register where Squidward reads a magazine while chaos happens in the kitchen.]''
*'''Sandals:''' Hey, what's taking so long?
*'''Squidward:''' Oh, believe me, it's worth it. ''[The pickle hits Squidward as the kitchen door opens]''
*'''SpongeBob:''' Come back! Fulfill your destiny! ''[Patrick appears in the door way on a pogo stick]'' Patrick! Stop that pickle! ''[Patrick grabs it and hops away on a pogo stick]'' Weird. I didn't even know Patrick owned a pogo stick.
*'''Sandals:''' ''[walks up to SpongeBob]'' Hey, is that my patty?
*'''SpongeBob:''' Not yet it isn't for you see, this patty is incomplete! ''[An alarm sounds off. Sandals covers his ears]'' Come on, new guy! We gotta get that pickle for the customer!'' [SpongeBob pulls out his bubble wand and makes a two seater bubble bicycle that knocks Sandals offscreen. SpongeBob puts the audience in the second seat.]'' Get on! In the history of The Krusty Krab, we have never served an incomplete patty and we're not gonna! Not on my watch!
*''[SpongeBob throws his hat down while he and the audience pedal out of the Krusty Krab and into the streets of Bikini Bottom]''
*'''SpongeBob:''' Now let's see. If I'm going to catch Patrick, I must first think like Patrick. ''[Makes stupid noises. He and the audience are almost hit by a bus and a boatmobile. He and the audience almost run over a fish. SpongeBob and the audience are almost hit by a truck. The bike turns to Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob hits the Jellyfish Fields sign. Jellyfish float into the screen]'' Look, jellyfish! Try to say "hi." Aren't they pretty? You know, if you're gentle, you can pet them. ''[The jellyfish zap SpongeBob and the viewers. Patrick hops past SpongeBob and the audience. SpongeBob and the audience ride past the "Entering Rock Bottom" sign]'' Look, it's Patrick! Hey, Patrick, I need that pickle to complete the patty! Hey, that looks like the back of the Rock Bottom sign. Rock Bottom?! Neptune on a needle! This is gonna get a little vertical! ''[SpongeBob screams as the audience and the bike falls into Rock Bottom. The audience lands on SpongeBob as three Rock Bottomites walk into the screen.]'' You OK, new guy? Well, at least the bubble bike made it. ''[SpongeBob turns around as a cyclops Rock Bottomite blows a raspberry and a chubby one bites the bubble bike and plays tug-o-war with SpongeBob]'' Hey! Let go!
*'''Sandals:''' ''[walking into the scene]'' Hey, is that my patty?
*'''SpongeBob:''' Not yet. ''[Sandals walks away. A snake-like Rock Bottomite opens his mouth]'' No! Don't pop the bubble bike! ''[The snake Rock Bottomite bites the bubble bike causing it to pop sending SpongeBob and the audience into the air. He screams as he and the audience are sent flying in the air]'' By the way, you're doing great for your first day. ''[He continues screaming as he spots Patrick going to The Chum Bucket]'' Hey, look, there's Patrick! He's going into the Chum Bucket! ''[SpongeBob and the audience bounce into Plankton's Laboratory.]''
*'''Patrick:''' Hi, SpongeBob! ''[Patrick is shown in a stock]''
*'''SpongeBob:''' Patrick?!
*'''Patrick:''' What are you doing here? ''[SpongeBob sets him free]''
*'''SpongeBob:''' Why did you steal my pickle?
*'''Patrick:''' Pickle? Wasn't me. ''[The Patrick on a pogo stick hops into the lab.]'' IT'S ME! ''[Patrick runs off screaming. The other Patrick jumps off his pogo stick] ''
*'''SpongeBob:''' Am I seeing double? What's going on here? ''[The lights in the lab turn on as Plankton on a hovercraft flies in laughing evilly]''
*'''Plankton:''' Isn't it obvious?
*'''SpongeBob:''' Plankton!
*'''Plankton:''' That's right, Plankton! My robotic Patrick has lured you and that delicious patty into my fiendish hands! Now hand it over!
*'''SpongeBob:''' Never! You can't make me!
*'''Plankton:''' Maybe I can't, but the Pat-Bot 3000 can. ''[He pushes a button on his hovercraft]'' Behold! ''[The Pat-Bot 3000's arm turns into a claw]'' A hydraulic metal... uh, to crush your bones. ''[A saw comes out of the robot's other arm]'' A titanium tipped ripping saw to cut your flesh! ''[A compartment opens in the robot's belly to reveal an arm with a paddle ball]'' And a paddle ball! Made from rubber and wood. And a staple. Anyways, get him! ''[The robot begins to chase SpongeBob all over the lab] ''
*'''SpongeBob:''' No!
*'''Plankton:''' Yes! ''[The robot and Plankton begin to chase SpongeBob and the audience around the lab]'' You can run but you can't hide, SquarePants! ''[Lasers shoot out of the robot's eyes as it tries to grab SpongeBob.]'' How do you like that, huh?!
*'''SpongeBob:''' I don't like it! I don't like it! ''[SpongeBob lifts his legs as the robot tries to saw him]''
*'''Plankton:''' Here comes the paddle ball! ''[SpongeBob dodges the paddle ball as the ball flies into the audience]'' I've got you right where I want you! ''[The robot's claw grabs SpongeBob, lifts him into the air and tries to saw him.]''
*'''SpongeBob:''' No! You can't have it! You can't have it! No! My baby!
*'''Plankton:''' Give me that patty! ''[The robot Patrick powers down]'' Huh?! ''[The robot is revealed to be plugged into an outlet that Patrick unplugged to use for his toaster.]''
*'''Patrick:''' Oh, sorry. Can I use this outlet?
*'''Plankton:''' Well, at least I still have the pickle. ''[The robot Patrick falls on Plankton]'' Well, this stinks. ''[The pickle rolls out from under the robot Patrick]''
*'''SpongeBob:''' Come on, little fella. That's right. ''[In a choir-like voice]'' Complete!
*'''Sandals:''' ''[walks in]'' Hey, is that my patty?
*'''SpongeBob:''' Yes, sir! ''[Sandals takes a bite of the patty]''
*'''Sandals:''' Uh, I asked for no pickles. ''[Sandals' stomach begins to rumble]''
*'''SpongeBob:''' No pickles, ha ha ha.
*'''Sandals:''' No, you don't understand. ''[Sandals inflates until he is covered in bumps and explodes. SpongeBob covers his ears. His feet, head and eyes land on each other.]'' I'm allergic to pickles. ''[Sandals' head walks off.]''
*'''SpongeBob:''' Well, that was "pickle-culiar". ''[SpongeBob laughs and the ride ends.]''
