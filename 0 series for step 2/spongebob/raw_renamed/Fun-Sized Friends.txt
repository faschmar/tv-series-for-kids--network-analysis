{{L|Patrick|Batter up!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob rolls in a little stove with pots, pans, a whisk, and a bowl. He pours pancake mix into the bowl and cracks two eggs. He mixes them up and puts the batter on the pan.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[flips the pancakes]'' Ah, oh.}}
{{L|''[Patrick throws the pan and SpongeBob swings his own pan to hit it like he was playing baseball.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I got it, I got it! ''[falls on the ground as the pancakes land on his plate.]''}}

{{L|''[Patrick slurps down on the pancakes and the two friends give each other a high-five.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Whoo-hoo!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick run around Squidward's house while banging on pots and pans. Moments later, an extremely irritated Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob and Patrick crash into the door, landing in front of Squidward.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What are you two dizzy dingbats doing out here?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Just treasuring our time together, Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, that time is over! Say good night, go to your separate houses, and be quiet!}}

{{L|Patrick|This is great. See you forever, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, see you forever, Patrick. ''[enters his house and yawns]'' Time for bed, Tiny Patrick.}}
{{L|''[Mini Patrick jumps happily on SpongeBob's hands and hops on his head as SpongeBob goes upstairs. The scene changes to SpongeBob washing his face with soap and water.

{{L|SpongeBob|Huh? Careful there, little buddy. The grill is hot. ''[puts Mini Patrick back on the counter with his spatula]''}}
{{L|Mini Patrick|''[gasps as he sees SpongeBob dump French fries into the fryer]'' Ohhh.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob pushes down the fryer and begins making French fries. Mini Patrick climbs down from the counter, climbs on the fryer and goes to dive in the cooking oil.]''}}

{{L|''[Mini SpongeBob jumps on a sand table and holds out a knife and fork; ready for breakfast. Patrick brings out various foods and makes it into a sandwich. He sticks out his tongue and eats the whole thing. leaving Mini SpongeBob stunned.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Didn't think I was gonna be able to eat all that. But then I did! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to SpongeBob returning home with Mini Patrick, who isn't to trilled with SpongeBob's pampering and is now dressed in a fancy suit.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[humming as he brushes Mini Patrick's hair]'' Brushy, brushy, brushy. ''[sees Patrick and Mini SpongeBob trying to lift a sand sofa]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Come on, Tiny SpongeBob. You gotta lift with your back.}}
{{L|''[Mini SpongeBob tries to lift the sand sofa, but it is too big and heavy for him. Patrick sees SpongeBob and lets go of the sand sofa, flattening Mini SpongeBob underneath.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, oh. Hey, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, hi. ''[gets nervous]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[makes a weird face]'' Eeh. ''[gets nervous]'' Hmm. Hmm.}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Good night.}}
{{L|''[Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick cry out for each other. It seems as though that SpongeBob and Patrick are unintentionally preventing their miniature selves from seeing each other. The scene changes to Mini Patrick now dressed in some baby pajamas with a zipper. He is growing tired of SpongeBob's pampering.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't want you getting into trouble during the night, so you're gonna stay in the aquarium like a good little sleepy clam. ''[drops Mini Patrick in the aquarium]''}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Just trying to live their lives, Patrick. Just trying to live their lives.}}
{{L|''[Mini Patrick attempts lift the remote, but couldn't because it was too big and heavy.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Poor little guys.}}
{{L|''[Mini SpongeBob attempts to flip the egg, but ends up sending himself and the egg flying into the television.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Our world is just too big for them. Ohh, I have an idea. ''[slithers himself free]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, I hope it's not another one of your crazy plans to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're thinking of Plankton, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[realizing his error]'' Oh, yeah!}}

{{L|Squidward|''[wakes up]'' Ah, too bright. ''[hears chattering]'' Oh, those two again!}}
{{L|''[Squidward shakes the sand off. It appears that Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick snuck into Squidward's house, took Squidward and buried him up to his head in the sand right in between their houses. Just then, Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick run around Squidward, banging pots and pans really loud.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What the—}}
{{L|''[Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick continue to bang on pots and pans like the actual SpongeBob and Patrick did early in the episode. Mini Patrick throws a pot and Mini SpongeBob hits it like a baseball, hitting Squidward in the nose.]''}}
