{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Extreme what?}}
{{L|British Gentleman|Extweme spowts.}}
{{L|Patrick|Extreme spots? Well, that's no fair. You're already covers in extreme spots. Ooh. Hold on a second. ''[hive buzzing, Patrick screaming, electricity crackling]'' Okay, let's do meet our new heroes.}}
{{L|''[The Drasticals laughing]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We want to join your extreme spots team, as you can see, we're also covered head to toe in the most extreme of spots.}}
{{L|Patrick|Itchy Spots!}}
{{L|''[Drasticals laugh]''}}
{{L|Johnny|It's extreme sports, not spots. So you wanna be a Drastical. Let's see what you got, little dude.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No problemo. I guess you just hop up like this... ''[revs engines, motorcycle drives off with his hands]'' Hey! Come back! ''[SpongeBob chases after it, motorcycle goes faster]'' Heeeeyyy! ''[Runs the other way, motorcycle picks him up and he screams as he goes through sand dunes. Motorcycle stops, SpongeBob faints]''}}
{{L|Granny|''[Chuckling, to Patrick]'' You're turn, fat boy!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey! How'd we get up here? ''[Patrick is pushed off cliff, hits several rocks then falls off mountain]''}}
{{L|Johnny|Our sports are too extreme for you dudes. Maybe we should start you two on something easier. What games do you dudes like to play?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, I know. How 'bout a little something called ''Jump rope?''}}
{{L|Johnny|Jumprope, eh? Demonstrate.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ready Patrick? On your mark, get set, jump rope!}}
{{L|Patrick|Extreme! ''[starts jumping]'' Hey, who's holding the other end?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I am of course. ''[Pan to the right]'' Hi Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|D'uh. ''[blows harmonica, starts singing]'' My best friend is SpongeBob, he has a square head, I try on his clothes while he's asleep in bed.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah! What?}}
{{L|Patrick|That's weird, my face is leaking.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're face isn't leaking. You're just sweating from all the exercise.}}
{{L|Patrick|Exercise?! ''[stops]'' Eww, I didn't sign up for this! ''[faints]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Extreme!}}
{{L|Johnny|Dude that was not extreme. Let the Drasticals show you how it's done. Grab it Granny ''[throws one end of jump rope, Granny bites end of rope, Ted makes a somersault and lands on rope with his tongue, jumps back into the air]''}}
{{L|Ted|Drasticals! Whoo! Yeah! ''[Lands and jumps over rope to the point where he steams up]''}}
{{L|Johnny|Kick it up a notch!}}
{{L|''[Ted sets aflame and shoots into the air]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooooh.}}
{{L|Ted|Yeah! ''[plane hits him, he falls face first into ground and burns to a crisp]''}}
{{L|Johnny|Yeah! See, extreme sports should be explosive! Boom!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Explosive, huh? I know just the thing! ''[dips bubble wand and blows bubble. Bubble pops]'' Boom! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick make several explosion sounds]'' Impressed?}}
{{L|Drasticals|No.}}
{{L|Johnny|Look dudes, to be extreme you gotta go bigger. Show 'em Drasticals! ''[Granny climbs huge bottle of bubble soap, dips huge wand and puts it in front of a ramp]'' Watch this! ''[Rides motorcycle into bubble, speeds into town and knocks over a building. Bubble pops and he gets crushed]'' Extreme. ''[Tunnels back, hops out of the ground]'' Now that's how you do extreme! You understand?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I think I do. Is fighting extreme?}}
{{L|Johnny|Fighting is totally extreme.}}
{{L|''[Scene opens in wrestling ring.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I want a clean fight. I don't wanna see any trash laying around. ''[Rings his head instead of bell. SpongeBob tries to punch a pillow, spins to the edge, launched back into pillow which land on his head]'' Oohh...We give up! Fling ''[Waves towel and throws at SpongeBob]'' That was close.}}
{{L|Johnny|Not so fast, that's not fighting. Stand aside ''[Stomps SpongeBob and Patrick out of ring]'' I'll show you how it's done! ''[Slams into pillow, puts into washing machine, sets it on wash]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Noo! It's dry-clean only!}}
{{L|''[Johnny smashes machine open, punches pillow out of ring]''}}
{{L|Pillow|Avenge me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Brutal.}}
{{L|Mattress|Charlie! ''[Jumps into ring and smashes Johnny, then does it again 6 times more]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Even more brutal!}}
{{L|Johnny|Now that was extreme, dudes. You think you're starting to get it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Oh yeah.}}
{{L|Johnny|So what else you got?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well there is one sport that Patrick's an expert at.}}
{{L|Patrick|Dumpster diving!}}
{{L|''[Patrick pushes dumpster, climbs it, and jumps in. SpongeBob cheers. Patrick sinks in and pops out, coughing up some trash.]''}}
{{L|Johnny|That's not extreme.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Spits out old toothbrush]'' How revolting. ''[Brushes teeth with it]''}}
{{L|Johnny|Okay, that's kinda extreme. Not bad, but the Drasticals will show you how it's done. ''[Ted brings in a ladder with diving board and Granny on top. Ladder is set higher]''}}
{{L|Granny|Okay artificial hip, don't fail me now. ''[Jumps into dumpster and chuckles. Johnny dumps her and trash into a garbage truck and crushes them with a compactor. Trash comes out a square shape and Granny pops out]'' Extreme!}}
{{L|Patrick|That is one tough elderly person.}}
{{L|Johnny|Dude, that was awesome! What other crazy sports do you dudes play?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, there is a very extremely extreme sport we play if you're up to it.}}
{{L|''[At Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob and Patrick chase after jellyfish]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, where are the Drasticals? ''[They feel ground shaking]'' Here they come!}}
{{L|''[Johnny catches jellyfish on motorcycle, Ted in the air, and Granny riding them like a tidal wave]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow!}}
{{L|Patrick|Amazing!}}
{{L|Johnny|Jellyfishing, yeah...''[Jellyfish flies into his mouth and stings him, Ted flies into huge jellyfish and burns, thrown into Johnny and Granny and they get caught in an explosion]''}}
{{L|Johnny|''[Covered in stings]'' Dudes, now we get it! These spots are way extreme!}}
{{L|Ted|And itchy!}}
{{L|British Gentleman|As you can see, extweme spowts are the direct bi-product of the most extweme spowts.}}
{{L|Patrick|Who is that guy?}}
