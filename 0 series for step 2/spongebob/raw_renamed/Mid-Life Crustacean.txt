{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[Mr. Krabs wakes up in his hammock in his bedroom. The radio clicks on]''}}
{{L|Radio DJ|You've got it tuned to K-O-L-D, K-Old, your all-oldies station. Here's a little something you may remember from the good old days.}}
{{L|♪You're old... Groaning like a geezer♪ ''[Mr. Krabs opens his eyes, which are crusty and coated in barnacles]'' ♪Feel yourself a-crackin' like an old has-been♪ ''[Mr. Krabs gets out of bed with all his joints cracking when he moves]'' ♪Look at yourself, old man, you've got multiple chins♪ ''[Mr. Krabs looks in his bathroom mirror. He pulls down his shirt to show a bunch of chins]'' ♪'Cause you're old...♪ ''[scene cuts to the kitchen. Mr. Krabs sits down at the table as Pearl comes in]''}}
{{L|Pearl Krabs|Good morning, Daddy. ''[gives him a kiss]'' I made you breakfast.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Thank you, sweet pea. I see you got creative with the bran today. ''[looks down at the plate to see his bran shaped as bacon, eggs, juice, and others]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Open up, it's time for the pill. ''[Pearl takes out a giant pill]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, barnacles! I hate the pill. ''[Pearl shoves the giant pill in his mouth and he swallows it]'' Pearl, do you think I'm... old?}}
{{L|Pearl|Well, of course I do! But that's okay. Daddies are supposed to be old.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?}}
{{L|Pearl|See, no one says cool anymore. That's such an old-person thing. Now we say "coral," as in: "That nose job is so coral."}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Coral, eh?}}
{{L|Pearl|Eww, when you say it, it sounds so uncoral.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, what if I said it with a different inflection? Co-''ral''.}}
{{L|Pearl|Don't you have to go to work or something, Dad?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Whoop, you're right! ''[eats his breakfast]'' Have a coral day, honey.}}
{{L|Pearl|''[picks up her phone and dials]'' Jenny? It's Pearl. "Coral" is definitely out. ''[scene cuts to Mr. Krabs walking outside]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ha! Old? What was I thinking? I ain't old. Huh? ''[turns around to see a boy scout helping him walk across]''}}
{{L|Boy Scout|Don't worry, Pops, we're almost across the street.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, get away from me. I don't need no snot-nosed little... ''[as he walks away, his arm comes off. Walks back to get it]'' Sorry you had to see that. ''[keeps walking to work where a fish is walking behind him]''}}
{{L|Harold|Come on, move it! Could you be any slower? And you've had your blinker on for the last five blocks. ''[Mr. Krabs turns around and notices he has two signals on his behind, the right arrow is blinking, so he covers his behind. He continues to walk until a ball rolls next to him]''}}
{{L|Tyler|Hey, mister, could you throw the ball back over here?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[picks up the ball]'' Hey, how's about I join you kids?}}
{{L|Tyler|Uhh, that's okay. You can keep it. Why do old people have to ruin the fun? ''[Mr. Krabs drops the ball. He walks up to a line of elderly fish]''}}
{{L|Elderly Fish #1|Hey, no cutting! You gotta wait your turn in line like everybody else! ''[Mr. Krabs notices a long line in front of the Bikini Bottom Cemetery]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No! No! I ain't old like you! I ain't old! I ain't old! ''[runs away]''}}
{{L|Elderly Fish #2|What's his problem? ''[the line is for ice cream]''}}
{{L|Lou|Next? ''[scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is sitting a table depressed]''}}
{{L|Monroe|Mommy, my Krabby Patty tastes funny.}}
{{L|Mother|Well, no wonder. It's all old and dried out. Like that man right there. ''[points to Mr. Krabs]'' Now put that thing where it belongs... in the garbage.}}
{{L|Monroe|♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la...♪ ''[Timmy walks up to the trashcan, but Mr. Krabs grabs his patty before he can get there]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, little patty, we're two of a kind. We've both lost our luster. ''[takes a bite out of the patty]'' Hmmm, so that's what I taste like.}}
{{L|Patrick|Good morning, Krusty Krew! ''[SpongeBob pokes his head out of the kitchen window]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[shouts]'' Hey, Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[shouts]'' Yeah, it's gonna rock!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you ready to go crazy?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm already hearing voices!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you ready to...?!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[yelling]'' SpongeBob! Patrick! Do you mind?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping!}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, how rude of some people!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hmmm, those youngsters are going out for a big night on the town. ''[stretches his eyes into the kitchen where SpongeBob and Patrick are talking]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoo! I've been looking forward to this night all week!}}
{{L|Patrick|Party!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What do you think we should do first?}}
{{L|Patrick|What shouldn't we do first? We're young, ''[Mr. Krabs' eyes move a little closer]'' we've got wheels, ''[Mr. Krabs' eyes move closer]'' the world is our oyster! SpongeBob, you got something on your shoulder. ''[SpongeBob notices Mr. Krabs' eyes are on his shoulders]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, boys, hanging out?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[looks at his large belly]'' Yes.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I couldn't help overhearing your big plans. And I was wondering if you had room for one more craaaaazy dude tonight, huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Of course. Did you wanna come with us, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, hadn't even crossed me mind. But, sure, I'll go!}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know, SpongeBob. He might cramp our style.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[appear in a picture with a silly look on them]'' Style!}}
{{L|Patrick|Let's see if he knows the secret cool-guy handshake. ''[holds out his hand]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uhh, yeah, course I know it! ''[begins to sweat]'' Uhh... uhh...}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm waiting... old man.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[shakes Patrick's hand]'' Uhh... how do you do?}}
{{L|Patrick|Fine, and you? All right, you're in. But I'm not happy about it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You passed the test, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Great! Why don't you boys show up at my house at eight o'clock?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I just wanna warn you, Mr. Krabs. We're always fashionably late.}}
{{L|French Narrator|8:01 PM. ''[scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' house. The doorbell rings]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey there, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready to party?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm ready to party! Are you ready to par- ''[Pearl runs by them crying in embarrassment]''}}
{{L|Pearl|Stop it, just stop it! You're embarrassing me, Dad! ''[sobbing]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So, what kind of hot rod will we be cruisin' in tonight?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Only the most powerful chick magnet in town. The Underwater Heartbreaker. ''[we see a bike with two streamers on each handle]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It's more like a chick repellent. And there's only two seats.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Calm your waters, Mr. Krabs. I modified this little baby myself. ''[scene cuts to SpongeBob & Patrick riding at the front of the bike, while Mr. Krabs is in a wagon behind them]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Are you sure this is what the kids are driving these days?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Only the cool kids. ''[a hot rod, driven by a young teen, pulls up beside them]''}}
{{L|Hot rod fish|Hey, you guys must be lost. Doofus Drive is around the corner!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're not lost, I've got my compass. ''[shows him the compass]''}}
{{L|Hot rod fish|So long, dorks! ''[speeds away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Goodbye, pals!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|We used to beat people up for saying things like that! Everything's all topsy-turvy now. ''[they pull up to "The Wash"]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Here we are: The Wash.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|They sure are giving these clubs some crazy names! I have to tell you boys... I'm a little nervous. I haven't been, you know, on the scene for quite a while now.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Just follow our lead, Mr. Krabs. And, above all, keep it cool.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Cool. Gotcha. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick walk away jumping up and down in a silly way. Mr. Krabs does the same]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[opens door]'' Hello, gang! SpongeBob's back!}}
{{L|Patrick|Let's party!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Any port in the store—! Wait a minute...this is a Laundromat. ''[scene shows the entire room is a place to do your laundry]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[all three looking at their reflections in the washer]'' Oh yeah, whoo! That's what I'm talking about. Oh, yeah! Yeah, the colors! whoo! ''[washer stops]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You guys want another rinse cycle? I'm buying.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You know, I love staring at delicates as much as the next guy, but it's just that I thought we'd see more of the nightlife. Something that'll give you that wild and crazy hot-blooded feeling, if you know what I mean.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I know what you mean, Mr. Krabs. This is only stop numero uno on our night of debauchery!}}
{{L|Patrick|Debauchery!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Debauchery! ''[scene cuts to the road where all three are picking up trash]'' Debauchery? I never thought of picking up trash under the highway as hot-blooded, but if it's what the kids are into...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So, are you feeling that wild and crazy feeling, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Not yet.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, you will. ''[scene cuts to all three in a kiddie swimming pool]'' Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm feeling a warm spot.}}
{{L|Patrick|Sorry. ''[scene cuts to them riding kiddie rides outside Barg'n Mart]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm feeling it, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[off-screen]'' Patrick, that's not a ride. ''[Patrick is riding on the back of Harold who is pushing a grocery kart with a bag of groceries in it]''}}
{{L|Harold|Get offa me! ''[scene cuts to them getting their teeth pulled]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? ''[scene cuts to them redoing a roof]'' Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? ''[scene cuts to them dressed in costumes playing Dungeons and Dragons]'' Art thou feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? ''[scene cuts to the library]'' You're feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Miss Shell|''[pops out]'' Shhh!}}
{{L|''[scene cuts to a place called "Bunny Buns," an area for kids to play in]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How about now? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? ''[kids in the room around running around Mr. Krabs, hanging on his hat streamers. Mr. Krabs has clown make-up on his face]''}}
{{L|Kids|Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So, you wanna know if I can feel it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Yeah!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Do you really wanna know if I can feel it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Yeah, yeah!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Because I can feel it! You wanna know what I'm feeling?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Yes!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[angry]'' I'm feeling like a total barnacle head! ''[swings the screaming kids around and around then off his hat]'' You think this is cool?! ''[jumps on a bunny and punches its head off]'' How about this?! ''[jumps on top of the bunny]'' And this? Am I with it now? ''[runs up to SpongeBob and Patrick]'' You guys wouldn't know a good time if it bit you in the aft end! I'm going home. You guys ain't cool, you're lame!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sadly]'' Lame?!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Lame! You're nerds! Geeks! Creeps! And babies!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Not babies! ''[both suck their thumbs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I may be old, but even an old bag of shells like me knows that you haven't suggested one cool thing all night! So good night to ya!}}
{{L|Patrick|I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|The what?}}
{{L|Patrick|I said, I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Panty raid? You're talking about girls, right? "Girl" girls?}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And you're talking about raiding their dressers for their underpants, right?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, yeah.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, count me in! If this works, I'll take back what I said about you two being lame!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[happy]'' Not lame! ''[scene cuts to the three of them carrying a ladder]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now this is more like it! ''[lean the ladder against a house]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Give us some credit, old man. We're panty professionals! ''[climbs the ladder]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We score here all the time. ''[all three tiptoe into a bedroom. Mr. Krabs opens a drawer and takes out a pair of panties]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Frilly things! We hit the jackpot! ''[everyone jumps up and down]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[holds up the pair of underwear he got]'' You finally came through for me, boys! I feel young again! ''[light turns on]''}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Eugene?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Mother?}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|What are you doing with my bloomers?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, I, uhh, uhh, heh, ''[hides his mother's bloomers behind his back]'' hehe... ''[turns around to SpongeBob and Patrick]'' Why didn't you tell me this was my mother's house?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why didn't you ask? ''[both run away. Mr. Krabs turns around to see his mother angry]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[giggles nervously then hides his mother's bloomers behind his back]'' But it was all SpongeBob and Patrick's idea!}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|Go to your room, mister. You're grounded for the rest of the night!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[walks away]'' Yes, Mommy. ''[boy scout from earlier is walking with Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Boy Scout|Don't worry, Pops. We're almost to your room. ''[Mr. Krabs groans. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' old bedroom. SpongeBob peeks through the window]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sighs]'' That's all right, lad. I certainly feel younger. ''[scene zooms out revealing Mr. Krabs is lying on his race car-shaped bed among a few toys]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good night, Mr. Krabs. ''[leaves]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Good night, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Mama Krabs|''[outside. We see SpongeBob leaving]'' Eugene, lights out!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes, Mommy. ''[the episode ends as the light turns off]''}}
