{{L|''[The episode starts with showing SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward's houses]''}}
{{L|Squidward|It's finally complete! ''[shows Squidward in his house at a table]'' After weeks and weeks of burning the candle at both ends, ''[voice calms down]'' literally, ''[a double-sided, burned candle is shown, and his voice returns in a louder tone]'' my first clarinet concerto is complete and ready to be performed! ''[falls at a quake, and his clarinet concerto papers fall in the fire of the double-sided candle]'' No! ''[now quaked again]'' Now, I'm flummoxed. ''[opens his front door, and he hits his head four times as he yells "Doh, doh, doh, doh." SpongeBob and Patrick are shown hammering a "For Rent" sign]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hit it one more time Patrick. Don't want anyone stealing it. ''[Patrick hammers the sign into the ground, and it is destroyed to pieces]'' Perfect.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[grunts angrily]'' All right, what's going on out here? I can't even hear myself think!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[raises his hand]'' Oh! Ooh! Can you smell yourself think?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[calmly]'' No. ''[raises his voice]'' As I was saying, you two... ''[Patrick interrupts]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Or see?}}
{{L|Squidward|No!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[screams]'' How, how about taste? Can you taste yourself think?}}
{{L|Squidward|Shut it! What are you two dingbats doing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We were just posting Patrick's new "For Rent" sign. We worked on it all morning, see? ''[the sign is shown]''}}
{{L|Squidward|For rent? You mean one of you is moving out?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard.}}
{{L|Patrick|Need a little extra cash if you know what I mean.}}
{{L|Squidward|Wow! To think this day started off so horribly and now... ‘’[realizes what Patrick said]’’ What do you mean you're just gonna rent out your front yard?}}
{{L|Patrick|First come, first, serve.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh great, now another idiot can move in.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, I would love to. Just let me check my planner. ''[takes out his planner and looks in it]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, thanks!}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh no, I'm sorry, I can't.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aww, why not?}}
{{L|Squidward|It's because I was planning to do "No such thing"! See?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, thanks. ''[Bubble transition]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, with those two bonebrains gone for the day, at least now I can finally get some peace and... ''[everything shakes]'' ...quiet. ''[walks outside]'' Now what are you two boobs up to? I thought you were gonna.. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick are not there]'' Huh? Well, if they’re not here, then I wonder who could have been making all of that-}}
{{L|Howard|Hello. My name is Howard.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hello, Howard.}}
{{L|Howard|I noticed this "For Rent" sign. Is this yard still for rent?}}
{{L|Squidward|Sorry, you're too late.}}
{{L|Howard|Hmmm. Howard is disappointed.}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah, well, aren't we all?}}
{{L|Howard|This looked like it might’ve been a wonderful place to pursue my passions...}}
{{L|Squidward|''[peeks out the door]'' Passions?}}
{{L|Howard|...painting…}}
{{L|Squidward|Painting?}}
{{L|Howard|…playing the bassion…}}
{{L|Squidward|The bassion?}}
{{L|Howard|...and enjoying a nice glass of tea in my front yard.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[speaks gibberish]'' I can hardly believe what I’m hearing. ''[sighs]'' Finally, a neighbor with some culture! Oh, I can only imagine! Painting portraits while sipping tea, recumbent bicycling into a museum, playing a duet together at the Bikini Bottom Philharmonic! ''[sighs again]''}}
{{L|Howard|''[leaves]'' Farewell. I should’ve known all this was too good to be true.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[stops him]'' Wait! Don't go! ''[panting]'' I was...just kidding!}}
{{L|Howard|Ok, well, in that case, I should move in right away!}}
{{L|Squidward| Wonderful!}}
{{L|Howard| Make yourself at home!}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, my. His designs sense are impeccable! ''[to Howard]'' Oh-ho-ho, I do feel right “at home".}}
{{L|Howard|Okie-dok, then. I’d like to propose a toast—to my new neighbor.}}
{{L|Squidward|New neighbor! ''[they both toast the tea. Squidward sips the tea.]''}}
{{L|Howard|While we're on the topic, what are the other neighbors like who live around here?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[nervous]'' Gah, other neighbors! Oh, they're just like any other neighbors, I suppose.}}
{{L|Howard|Well, that's perfect. I'm the the type of person that likes all kinds of neighbors!}}
{{L|Squidward|That is perfect!}}
{{L|Howard|Well, as long they’re not jellyfishers. ''[Squidward nearly chokes on his tea]'' I can't stand living near anybody who jellyfishes. But, luckily, they're not the worst type of neighbor.}}
{{L|Squidward|‘’[chuckles]’’ Yes, that-that is lucky. ‘’[sips his tea]’’}}
{{L|Howard|That would be the bubble blowers. ''[Squidward spits out his tea]'' Between the jellyfishers and bubble blowers, I just couldn't stand to stay in my old neighborhood anymore.}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, rest assured Howard, ''[chuckles]'' you-you won't even ''notice'' the neighbors around here.}}
{{L|Howard| Well, that’s a relief.}}
{{L|Squidward| Yes, uh, isn’t it? ''[hears SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob| La la la la!}}
{{L|Patrick|La la la la!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|La la la la!}}
{{L|Patrick|La la la la!}}
{{L|SpongeBob| La la la la! ''[Squidward looks through the window]''}}
{{L|Patrick|La la la la!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|La la la la!}}
{{L|Patrick|La la la la! ''[a jellyfish swims by and starts chasing them. SpongeBob and Patrick run while laughing until they see the mobile house]''}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, look! There's a mobile home parked in front of my house!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, do you know what that means?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm a landlord!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[holding each other’s hands and jumps]'' All hail the landlord! ''[laughter]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes?}}
{{L|Patrick|Why don’t we knock on the door, and meet the new neighbor?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Great idea.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh no!}}
{{L|Howard|What's going on? Is sombody there?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[closes the curtains]'' No, no! There's nobody at all for miles around!}}
{{L|Howard|Well, are you sure? I thought I heard voices.}}
{{L|Squidward|Nope, there weren't any voices.}}
{{L|Howard|Perhaps it's just the other neighbors coming to meet me. We'd better open it up and have a look.}}
{{L|Squidward|I can't let you do that!}}
{{L|Howard|''[chuckles]'' Well, of course you can. They're your neighbors, too.}}
{{L|Squidward|NO! You really don't wanna go out there, trust me! ''[jerks on Howard's arm harder and harder]''}}
{{L|Howard|You're hurting my arm!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[lets go]'' Oh! I’m sorry, Howard. I was just hoping you and I could, um…}}
{{L|Howard|Could, what?}}
{{L|Squidward|Could, um, uh, take advantage of this peace and quiet and  perform a little duet. Together. Just two of us. With each other. You know, you on bass on, me on clarinet. Together.}}
{{L|Howard|Why, that's a splendid idea. I'll get some sheet music.}}
{{L|Squidward|Wonderful! ''[looks through the curtains]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Did you see the way those curtains jerked shut?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah. Our new neighbor must be really shy.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, Maybe we should just come back and meet him later.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, besides, we have more pressing things to attend to—like this jellyfish we've befriended and this brand new bottle of bubbles!}}
{{L|Squidward|Phew! That was close.}}
{{L|Howard|And a one and a two... ''[they both olay on their instruments]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[thinking]'' Squiddy, this is absolutely the best day of your life! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing]''}}
{{L|Howard|Perplexing. I could've sworn I just had this thing tuned.}}
{{L|Squidward|Uh, that's me! I think this reed needs replacing. Excuse me for a moment! ''[runs and builds a fence around Howard's house]'' There! Now, where were we?}}
{{L|Patrick|Look! Our new neighbor must be even shyer than we thought!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah. ''[a bubble pops and a jellyfish stings Patrick. They both laugh]''}}

*'''Howard:''' There it is again.<br />

*'''Squidward:''' ''[laughs nervously]'' Excuse me one more time! ''[builds a wall of cinder blocks as more laughing is heard.]'' Just a second. ''[runs outside and paints zippers on SpongeBob and Patrick's mouths]'' Now, uh... where were we? ''[SpongeBob and Patrick unzip the zippers and laugh. Squidward climbs in a bulldozer and pushes SpongeBob and Patrick's houses off a cliff. SpongeBob and Patrick run after them and jump off the cliff. Squidward then comes back inside]'' I'm back.<br />
{{L|Howard|''[angrily]'' What is going on? Are you hiding something?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[nervously]'' Why, Howard, I would never hide anything from you!}}
{{L|Howard|Stand aside! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick are shown jellyfishing and blowing bubbles]'' Repulsive! Somebody's got to stop these bubble blowing jellyfishers!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[crying]'' WAIT! Please, Howard, don't go! You're the rain of sunshine I've had in years!}}
{{L|Howard|I'm sorry. It's too late, Mr. Tentacles!}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, Neptune, no!}}

{{L|Howard|''[to SpongeBob and Patrick]'' You there! ''[pops a bubble]'' Hey! That was actually kind of fun! Maybe it's time I stop being so stuffy and loosened up for a change! ''[joins in on the fun]''}}

{{L|Squidward|I know I can handle two dunderheads, but I draw the line at three! ''[knocks out the brick and Howard's trailer rolls away]''}}
{{L|Howard|My house! ''[runs after it and jumps off the cliff]'' I knew it was too good to be true.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sadly as he holds a piece of the broken sign]'' Well, I almost had a decent neighbor.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, Squidward. We can cheer you up. ''[blows a bubble]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Go on. Pop it!}}
{{L|Squidward|Pop it? Me? Well at this point, what have I got to lose? ''[bubble floats away]'' Hey, come back here, you bubble! ''[bubble floats over the same cliff and Squidward jumps off of it]'' Jellyfishing bubble blowers!}}
