{{L|Snow-woman|If I live to be a trillion and two I will never forget the year Goddard the 200-Watt Dog saved Nickmas. But we all know that story. What we don't know is the good stuff, what happened at the after-party. It all started here at Santa's workshop. Everyone was there: Yukon Chinelius, Winter Squidlock, The Abominable Starfish, even jolly ol' Saint Nick himself.}}
{{L|Saint Nick|Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho.}}
{{L|Rapper Krabs| K to the R to the A to the B to the B to the Y. That's krabby!}}
{{l|Snow-woman|The joint was jumping, the music was pumping, and the whole shindig was catered by Donner and Blitzen. So, naturally, things started getting juicy. There was gossip.}}
{{L|SpongeBob the Elf|I don't want to be an elf. I want to be a fry cook.}}
{{L|Elf That Looks Like Jorgen Von Strangle| A fry cook? ''[talking to Jimmy Neutron]'' SpongeBob wants to be a fry cook.}}
{{L|Elf That Looks Like Jimmy Neutron|''[talking to Zim]'' SpongeBob wants to be a fry cook.}}
{{L|Elf That Looks Like Invader Zim|Who's SpongeBob? Tell me!}}
{{L|Snow-woman|There was flirting.}}
{{L|Chinelius|''[talking to Debbie Thornberry]'' There I was, Sweet Cheeks, cornered with the vicious and ferocious Abominable Starfish of the north. ''[Tommy is jumping up and down on Abominable Starfish's belly]''}}
{{L|Snow-woman|And, whoo, there were embarrassing photos. ''[pictures of SpongeBob ripping his pants, Plankton underneath the mistletoe with Helga, and Goddard peeing on a present]'' But somehow, through it all, they managed to remember the true meaning of the holiday season. ''[everyone is holding hands around the Christmas tree]'' To put aside our differences, join together, and fight for presents! ''[everyone fights and gets their presents]'' From all of us to all of you, Happy...}}
{{L|Voiceover|Insert holiday choice here...}}
{{L|All| ...to you!}}
