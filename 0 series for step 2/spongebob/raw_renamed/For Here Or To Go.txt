{{L|Mr. Krabs|Eh, uh, no. He's out of town.}}

{{L|''[Mr. Krabs blows raspberry]''}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Golly, Mr. Krabs, what if Plankton guesses right and wins a ''[gasps and says next words in gasping voice]'' Krabby Patty?}}

{{L|Mr. Krabs|No worries. That nitwit Plankton hasn't got a chance.}}
{{L|Plankton|Hmm. ''[puts on eye equipment with numerous lenses. The device analyzes the bun seeds inside of the jar. He uses a calculator to calculate the analysis.

{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, he's getting close.}}
{{L|Plankton|...And one!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs laughs.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wrong! It's five hundred thousand three hundred and none! You are one over the mark. You lose.}}

{{L|Plankton|Eh!}}
{{L|''[Plankton blows raspberry]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hold on. There's something on the lid. You missed a bun seed, Mr. Krabs! Plankton was-- right.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob tears in half.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes!}}
{{L|Agent Twirp|I now command you to give Mr. Plankton his prize.}}
{{L|Plankton|You heard him, Krabs. Give me a Krabby Patty.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I can't.}}
{{L|Plankton|What?!}}
{{L|''[Agent Twirp pulls out the "CLOSED" tape again.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob needs to clean the grill first.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I cleaned it this morning.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Doesn't your spatula need aligning or something?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nope, she's perfectly aligned.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs crosses his arms.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Drat your efficiency! Uh, oh, yeah! ''[He snaps his fingers.]'' I can't serve you your Patty until after the show!}}
{{L|Plankton|What show?}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs runs to the sign, takes out a pen, and puts the cap in his mouth. He starts writing something on the board behind him.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|The show that comes with a free Krabby Patty. ''[He shows the sign and it has, "and a show." on it. He spits the cap out of his mouth.]'' See?}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, come on! Are you kidding me?}}
{{L|Agent Twirp|It clearly says, "and a show." I'll allow it.}}
{{L|Plankton|Drat!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs is shown cutting wood. Plankton is shown. Mr. Krabs is shown sewing a purple piece of cloth. He has pins in his mouth.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Is this part of ''[does finger quotes]'' "the show?"}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs is shown in front of a puppet show stage with a paint brush.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No, this is isn't part of the show.}}
{{L|''[He paints part of it.]''}}
{{L|Agent Twirp|Mm, such lovely filigree, wouldn't you agree?}}
{{L|Plankton|Ugh.}}
{{L|''[The curtains open. A character that is made of a Krabby Patty as it head, a fry container as its body, fries as its limbs, and fake eyes appears. SpongeBob slides up.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Puppets!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Once upon a time, there was a happy Patty Laddie.}}
{{L|Patty Laddie|La la la la la la la la!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|He was beloved by all the good-hearted people in the world. Alas, there is also a villain in this story, by the name of ''[A green paper bag is shown with two straw antennas, two fry arms, two fangs, a red eye, and a unibrow.]'' Pla-- Flankton!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Boo! Hiss!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs takes Flankton away and brings the Patty Laddie back up.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So, one day, when the lad was minding his own business, Flankton struck and took a huge bite out of the Laddie's face!}}
{{L|''[Patty Laddie screams and Mr. Krabs takes ketchup out and sprays it around.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ahh, My face! Ahhhhhhhh, My face!}}
{{L|Plankton|Okay, we get it already!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Unfortunately for Flankton, ''[The Patty Laddie is shown as an angel.]'' the Patty didn't sit well with him. And he was so evil, it caused him to bloat something fierce... ''[Mr. Krabs inflates Flankton.]'' ...until eventurally he popped! ''[He pops the bag.]'' The end.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[sarcastically, while clapping his hands]'' Oh, bravo. Bravo. Why does the puppet get to eat a Krabby Patty and I don't? And why aren't you in the kitchen cooking my patty?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Alright, SpongeBob, we can't stall him any longer. Make a good one, laddie. This may be the last Patty you'll ever cook.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll do my best, sir.}}
{{L|''[He starts sobbing. He enters the kitchen and Squidward walks to Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob then looks out the window and cries. This makes Squidward and Mr. Krabs jump in surprise.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[whispering to Squidward]'' Psst. I got a plan. You keep that blasted bureaucrat busy.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs pushes Squidward towards Agent Twirp.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Uh, excuse me, Mr. Agent, sir. While we're waiting, perhaps I could direct your attention to-- oh, to the many code violations you'll find ''[He pushes Agent Twirp up and starts heading him away from his chair.]'' if you turn this way. It's a death trap.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs enters the kitchen and takes all of the buns and goes into the restroom. He enters a stall. A customer leaves a stall and walks to the sink. Mr. Krabs is shown inserting the buns into the toilet. The customer is shown washing his hands. Mr. Krabs grunts. The customer stops washing his hands and looks at the stall. Mr. Krabs gets on the toilet to try to push the buns down.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|There we go. ''[He flushes the toilet.]'' Ooh, that takes care of that. ''[Mr. Krabs leaves the bathroom.]'' And in three, two, one.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob.}}  
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, it's awful! We're all out of buns!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No buns? Drat the luck! ''[Mr. Krabs sees a delivery truck pull up.]''}}
{{L|Truck Driver|Got a delivery for the Krusty Krab. Where do you want us to put these buns?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh, good thing I ordered us extra b-- for the contest crowd.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob then realizes his error as Mr. Krabs crosses his arms and looks at him for now understanding. The scene changes to show SpongeBob in from of the Cash register boat with the Kitchen door open. He takes off his hat and sadly plays trumpet as Squidward and Mr. Krabs bring Plankton the Krabby Patty.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Finally! At long last, the Krabby Patty is mine! Go ahead and wrap that up, son. I'll take it to go.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|One Krabby Patty to go. ''[SpongeBob puts the Krabby Patty in a "to go" bag.]'' ''[Off-Screen]'' Here you are.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, no, you don't! ''[He takes the bag]'' You have to eat it on the premises. ''[He puts the patty on the plate.]'' Them's the rules.}} 
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs runs off-screen and runs back with the contest sign. It has, "Must be eaten at the Krusty Krab" on it.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yeah, that's what it says.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So?}}
{{L|Plankton|Okay, okay. I will! ''[He eats Krabby Patty whole.]'' I bid you good day, sir.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You gotta swallow it here on the premises.}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, come on.}}
{{L|Agent Twirp|I'll allow it.}}
{{L|Plankton|Fine! ''[He swallows it whole and pants.]'' Can I go now?}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton and throws him back to the Chum Bucket. He slides into the lab and gets on to a table.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Karen, quick! You gotta cut this Krabby Patty out of me, stat!}}
{{L|Karen|But what about anesthetic?}}
{{L|Plankton|There's no time! I can feel it digesting!}}
{{L|''[Karen lifts her arm revealing that there is a saw attachment.]''}}
{{L|Karen|Whatever you say, dear. Hold still. ''[The exterior of the Chum Bucket is shown]'' This may pinch a little.}}
{{L|''[Plankton screams in pain. The scene changes to shown SpongeBob looking out a Krusty Krab window at the Chum Bucket with a sign and a line of customers.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What is it, lad?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Take a look.}}
{{L|''[The scene shows Plankton with a bandage on his stomach and holding a megaphone as a line enters the Krusty Krab.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Keep it moving, nice and orderly. Hey, Eugene! You want a free Krabby Patty? Just guess how many customers I can fit into the Chum Bucket!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs gasps.]''}}
{{L|Abigail Marge|I feel terrible! The Krabby Patty takes like stomach acid!}}
{{L|''[She gags and runs off. Henry Bart leaves.]''}}
{{L|Henry-Bart|Yeah, and it tastes like aspirin and carrots! ''[rubs tongue]'' Ugh! Get it off! Get it off!}}
{{L|''[All of the customers scream and run away.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Wait, come back! Oh, come on, Karen, what happened?}}
{{L|Karen|I just did what you asked. ''[She lifts up a bag of Plankton's stomach contents.]'' I analyzed the contents of your stomach and used them to synthesize a ''[She lifts up a Krabby Patty that is messed up.]'' Krabby Patty.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs laughs.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It warms me heart to see that little twerp fail. Okay, boyo, fun time's over. ''[He hands SpongeBob a plunger.]'' Now go fish them buns out of the toilet. Oh, yeah, ''[He holds up bun seed jar.]'' and put these seeds back on 'em.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's my Krabs!}}
