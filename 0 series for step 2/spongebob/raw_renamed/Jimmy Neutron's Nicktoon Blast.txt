==SpongeBob Policy Promo==
{{L|SpongeBob|Welcome to Nicktoons Studios! We hope you enjoy your visit. While you're on the ride, we ask that you refrain from the following activities: (TBA) Thank you for joining us, and we hope you enjoy your- ''[screams as he runs away from a sea monster]''}}<br />

==Pre-show==
{{L|The ride begins with Carl fixing a rocket.}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Carl, that's an advanced piece of high-tech quality home-crafted rocketry, not a toy. Plus, we have a presentation coming up, uh hu-hu, now I guess. Hello everyone! I'm Jimmy Neutron, and this is my cybernetic K9, Goddard. That's Carl over there NOT TOUCHING ANYTHING...}}

{{L|Carl|Dang!}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Welcome to my rocket lab, right here at Nicktoons Studios! Goddard, floor plan.}}

{{L|Goddard|Bark! Bark!}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|This is where the Rugrats live. Over two seven klicks, east-south-east of that is Arnold's neighborhood. And right here, precisely at sea level is [[Bikini Bottom]]. And of course, my Rocket Lab, where we are right now! Finally, it's with great pleasure and pride that I present to you...the Mark IV! ''[Carl is seen not controlling it]'' *sigh* Carl!}}

{{L|Carl|''[screams until the Mark IV hits the ground] The room's looking really busy...}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Along with the Mark IV is my Mark II, and the original, slightly unpredictable Mark I.}}

{{L|Carl|What happened to the Mark III?}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|The Mark IV is triumphant in engineering. It's the fastest, strongest rocket ever built.}}

{{L|Alarm plays}}

{{L|Carl|What's that, Jim?}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|VOX, status report!}}

{{L|VOX|Intruder detected outside the rocket lab, Jimmy.}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Security cam! Check the perimeter. All seems fine. Please, let me know if you see anything. If the Mark IV lands in the wrong hands... Maybe it's just a false alarm. Probably a bug in the security system.}}

{{L|Carl|Jimmy... ''[Ooblar arrives]'' A Yolkian!}}

{{L|Ooblar|So, Jimmy Neutron, my old nemesis, we meet again!}}

{{L|Carl|I hope nemesis means buddy.}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Ooblar! What are you doing here?!}}

{{L|Ooblar|You left THIS on my ship!}}

{{L|Carl|Mr. Fluffkins!}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|You came ALL THIS WAY to return Carl's bear.}}

{{L|Ooblar|Oh my, Neutron! Just wait 'till you see what we've got planed for you. We made a tape.}}

{{L|Carl|Cool.}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Carl...}}

{{L|Cut scene-tape}}

{{L|Ooblar|Please, can I enslave him?}}

{{L|King Goobot|No.}}

{{L|Ooblar|Please?}}

{{L|King Goobot|No.}}

{{L|Ooblar|Please?}}

{{L|King Goobot|No.}}

{{L|Ooblar|Please?}}

{{L|King Goobot|Nooo.}}

{{L|Ooblar|Please?}}

{{L|King Goobot|Fine!}}

{{L|Ooblar|Wehooo!!}}

{{L|King Goobot|Jimmy Neutron's developed a powerful new rocket, the Mark IV. Steal it. Bring it back here. Then we'll duplicate it so my egg armies will use it to...ENSLAVE THE EARTH!!!}}

{{L|Ooblar|But enslaving the Earth was MY idea!}}

{{L|King Goobot|Whatever. Just get me that ship.}}

{{L|End of cut scene-tape}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Ooblar!}}

{{L|Carl|Jimmy, you've got to stop him!}}

{{L|Ooblar|Too late, Neutron! I claim the rocket in the name of Yolkus!}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Carl, the remote!}}

{{L|Ooblar|GIVE ME THAT! ...or I'll hurt you.}}

{{L|Carl|Okay.}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Carl!}}

{{L|Carl|I couldn't help it Jim. He used some kind of space mind meld on me.}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Come on Carl, you have to stop Ooblar! We're the only ones who can save the [[Nicktoons]], and the planet!}}
{{L|Carl|We? No Jimmy, I don't think that's a good-}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|We'll take the wrap shooter and you guys follow the Mark I.}}
{{L|Carl|I thought you said the Mark I was slightly unpredictable.}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Well, it's not totally unpredictable. Besides, I'll pilot the Mark I by remote control. What could go wrong?}}
{{L|As the Mark I steams, the screen signals to black.}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|I can fix that.}}
{{L|Carl|Mommy...}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Come on! The rockets are waiting...}}

{{L|Carl|Ooh! My aching head!}}

{{L|Cosmo|Bacon head? Okay! ''[Carl screams in response]''}}

{{L|Elvis|Ohh! Bacon!}}

{{L|Carl|Don't let him eat my hair Jimmy!}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Ugh, this isn't really helping guys!}}

{{L|Cosmo|Okay. Here, Carl!}}

{{L|Carl|Go away! ''[Elvis disappears]''}}

{{L|Carl|Whoa! (not included on the YouTube version)}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Look, that's the Yolkian planet!}}

{{L|Carl|Uh, Jim, they don't really like us here.}}

{{L|Jimmy Neutron|We've got to stop him, Carl!}}

{{L|Carl|Oh, I've got a funny feeling, and this time I don't think it's death!}}

{{L|Carl|I wanna go home!}}

{{L|They teleport back to earth.}}

{{L|Jimmy|Uh-oh...}}

{{L|Carl|I'm kinda hoping uh-oh is a pilot term-}}

{{L|Jimmy|Nothing to worry about, Carl; prepare to splash down.}}

{{L|Jimmy|Wait! I can't see!}}
