{{L|''[The episode begins with SpongeBob once again trying to pass his boating test. SpongeBob is driving out of control.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Look out! Oh!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob hits the boat against the fence and the boat bounces back on the road. The boat swerves around in circles and a passing driver crash into the fence.]''}}
{{L|Driver 1|Learn how to drive!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm trying!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Calm down, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, Mrs. Puff!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob comes up with an idea as a bottle of bubble soap appears above his head.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nothing soothes one's frazzled nerves like blowing bubbles! ''[blows lot of bubbles that covers the boat]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|No blowing bubbles while driving!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob's bubbles pops into the eyes of many drivers. SpongeBob's boat stops.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Phew! ''[sighs]''}}
{{L|''[The drivers appear out of the cloud of bubbles and crash into SpongeBob's boat, inflating Mrs. Puff in the process. SpongeBob laughs nervously as the drivers moan and groan in pain. Firefighters arrive to put out the fire.]''}}
{{L|Driver 2|I can't feel my big toe.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So, uh, how'd I do?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[deflates herself]'' Get out! You're never getting a boating license!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[whimpers as he goes to leave]'' But—but—}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[screams]'' Never! Never!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob curls up and sulks away. A piece of debris falls on Mrs. Puff's head, inflating her again.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll never pass my driver's test, I'll never get my license, and I'll never know the joys of boat ownership!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob notices Larry's boat at his gym.]''}}
{{L|Nancy Suzy Fish|Ooh...}}
{{L|Tina Fran|It's really nice.}}
{{L|''[The girls giggle.]''}}
{{L|Larry|Oh, yeah, it's a turbo jet. 390 sea horse power with 11-to-1 pop-up piston. ''[chest revs like a racecar engine]'' We're talking some serious muscle!}}
{{L|''[Larry turns on his boat and his engine roars.]''}}
{{L|Tina Fran|I love your boat, Larry! ''[hugs the tire]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob murmurs as he sees Larry's boat. He sulks off as the girls continue to admire Larry and his boat. SpongeBob continues to sulk back to his house until he sees Mr. Krabs washing his boat.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, hey there, boyo! Lovely day for a boat wash! ''[wrings out his sponge]'' Isn't it?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob runs away, crying.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob stops running and continues to cry. Then he notices Patrick.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Patrick, you want to hang out?}}
{{L|Patrick|Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Your boat. ''[shrinks]'' Sure, Patrick. See you later. ''[whimpers]''}}
{{L|''[Patrick hums as he takes out a flying disc.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Catch! ''[throws flying disc at the boat]''}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to SpongeBob sulking behind his house. He blows a bubble version of Mrs. Puff.]''}}
{{L|Bubble Mrs. Puff|You're a very good driver, SpongeBob, and my favorite student. Here's your license.}}
{{L|''[The Bubble Mrs. Puff blows a bubble license and gives it to SpongeBob before she pops.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh! ''[bubble license pops]'' Aww! If only I was as good at driving as I am at blowing bubbles. ''[sulks down; gasps]'' Oh! That's it!}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to SpongeBob putting on some shades.]''}}
{{L|Abigail Marge|Whoa!}}
{{L|Tom|What is that?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob appears to be driving in a bubble-shaped boat. As he drives it, everyone seems to take notice of it. He stops at a stoplight.]''}}
{{L|Girls|Oh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|All right, all right.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob bounces inside his bubble boat and makes it go faster. A boat in back of the girls' boat crashes at seeing SpongeBob's bubble boat. Just then, a motorcycle cop comes by.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Pleasant day for a drive, hey, Officer?}}
{{L|Motorcycle Cop|Sir, I'm going to need to see your license for that, um...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' You don't need a license to drive a bubble.}}
{{L|Motorcycle Cop|Hmm, I suppose you're right. Carry on, citizen.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob drives off with his bubble boat. The scene changes to SpongeBob coming home with his bubble boat. He enters his house and jumps in front of Gary, who is sleeping on his chair.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gary!}}
{{L|Gary|''[yowls]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You'll never believe it! I was out driving all day! Yes, driving! First, I drove down the street like this!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob imitates his driving experience by floating around the house.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Then I made a right turn on red like this.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob imitates his right turn on red and floats around the living room. He lands on top of Gary.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You should've been there, Gary! Oh, it was like a dream come true!}}
{{L|Gary|''[grumbling]'' Meow.}}
{{L|''[Gary goes back to sleep. SpongeBob hears a knock at the door.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmm?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob answers the door and sees various people.]''}}
{{L|Green Fish|I'm here for a bubble boat.}}
{{L|Martin|Uh, yeah, me too!}}
{{L|Dave|I want one!}}
{{L|Various people|Uh, yeah, yeah, me too! Yes, please. One, please.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I'm not sure I have enough soap to make this many bubble boats.}}
{{L|Green Fish|Please?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I suppose I could tap into my rainy day reserves.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to SpongeBob carrying a large bottle-full of bubble soap for everyone to have bubble boats. He pushes the bottle into the tub and fills it with soap. He kicks the bottle away. The green fish grunts in excitement. SpongeBob takes out his bubble wand from his mouth.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|One bubble boat coming right up!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob dips his wand into the soap and blows the green fish a bubble boat.]''}}
{{L|Green Fish|Thank you!}}
{{L|''[The green fish drives off with his bubble boat.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Down here, idiot! I want to strike fear in the hearts of other drivers. You got something terrifying in that wand for me, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I sure do, Plankton!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob dips his wand into the soap and blows Plankton a bubble boat that appears to be a killer robot. Plankton tries to get in, but he bounces off because the bubble is too big.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Oof!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob takes out a straw and sips the bubble boat down to Plankton's size. Plankton gets into his bubble boat.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Ha-ha-ha, you fool! Now I will rule the streets! ''[cackles]''}}
{{L|''[Plankton starts to drive his boat, but gets stepped on by Larry within seconds.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Ouch!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob looks on, disgusted, as Larry raises his foot, unsticking Plankton from his foot. Plankton, squished into a blob, crawls away.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Strike fear...}}
{{L|Larry|Hmm...blow me something that screams Larry, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm on it, Larry!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob pulls out a bigger wand, dips it in the soap, inhales and blows three huge bubbles until he shrivels. The three bubbles form into a bubble boat that has muscles like Larry.]''}}
{{L|Larry|Now, this is what I call a muscle car!}}
{{L|''[Larry jumps into his bubble boat as Tina drives by with her bubble boat.]''}}
{{L|Tina Fran|I love your boat, Larry!}}
{{L|''[Larry's bubble boat bulks up as they drive away. Just then, a huge line of people line up at SpongeBob's house.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sighs]'' I'll never blow enough bubble boats at this rate. Yahoo! ''[jumps into tub]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob absorbs the bubble soap and blows a huge amount of bubble boats for everyone. The crowd cheers. Meanwhile at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, Mrs. Puff is preparing for class.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[hums as she writes on the board]'' Greetings, class. My name is—''[gasps]''}}
{{L|''[No one is there.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[startled stammer]'' Mrs. Puff. Oh, now that everyone's driving bubbles, they don't need licenses. ''[sighs]'' I guess there's just no place in this world for an old driving instructor.}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff puts her apple in her apples box. She drives away from her Boating School and drives into the street.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh! Bah!}}
{{L|Fred|Hey, watch it, lady!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff swerves into a passing driver.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Ah!}}
{{L|Tom|I'm driving over here!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff swerves into another passing driver.]''}}
{{L|Mable|Hey, hey, hey, hey!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh—wah!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff swerves into another passing driver.]''}}
{{L|Clay|Hey! Pick a lane, butter-brain!}}
{{L|''[A stoplight turns red as Mrs. Puff frantically tries to drive. As she drives, she runs through a stoplight, popping many bubble boats in the process. Just then, a motorcycle cop comes by on a bubble motorcycle.]''}}
{{L|Motorcycle Cop|I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the boat, ma'am. Do you know why I pulled you over?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|You ran my plates and saw my rap sheet?}}
{{L|Motorcycle Cop|What? No. Your vehicle has been outlawed, ma'am.}}
{{L|''[A truck driver tolls Mrs. Puff's boat with his bubble truck, throwing out her apples in the process.]''}}
{{L|Motorcycle Cop|Now that everyone drives bubble boats, real boats have been deemed too sharp and pointy to be street legal. ''[writes a ticket]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|But I've never driven a bubble!}}
{{L|''[The motorcycle cop gives Mrs. Puff a ticket and leaves.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Bubble boating school?}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to Mrs. Puff's Boating School now changed to Bubble Boating School. Mrs. Puff walks to the school, worried.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. ''[opens door]'' Please don't be SpongeBob.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob is seen at the desk.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! ''[spins on the chair until he flies into the board]'' Hi, Mrs. Puff.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Of course.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You must be here for the bubble lessons. Don't worry, Mrs. P. ''[blows bubble]'' You'll be learning from a master.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob bounces his bubble around. He puts his foot on it and pops it, making him fall over.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa! ''[belches out bubble and laughs]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Great.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the driving track in the bubble boat.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now, to get your bubble going, just pump your legs like this.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob pumps his legs and makes the bubble boat move. He gives the steering wheel to Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff tries to do what SpongeBob did, but she loses her balance.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh! Ooh! Oh!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff inflates herself inside the bubble boat.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nice start.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the starting line again. Mrs. Puff pumps her legs and manages to control the bubble boat. She makes a left turn from the wall and turns where the safety cones are. SpongeBob is writing down her scores. Mrs. Puff avoids prickly cactuses. However, she did not notice the cactuses that are on fire.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh! Fire!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff makes the bubble boat run through the burning cactuses and swerves it into the school's lighthouse. The lighthouse is set on fire and firemen arrive in their bubble firetruck to put out the fire. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the starting line again. Mrs. Puff takes a deep breath and drives the bubble boat again. She goes over a hill, through a loop-de-loop hill, and drives past the flaming cactuses.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh! Ah! Hmm. Hah. Eeh.}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff stops the bubble boat at the starting line.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|I did it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mrs. Puff, you're ready.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Really?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Absolutely! You just need to pass your final test...out there. ''[points to people driving in their bubble boats]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[whimpering]'' Oh.}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff drives the bubble boat out of the boating school.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nice and easy. Doing great.}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff continues driving.]''}}
{{L|Harold|Hello!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff waves to Harold.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|You know, this whole bubble boating thing isn't so bad. ''[laughs]'' Maybe I could—}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff frantically panics now that she is on the freeway.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's okay! Just calm down!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff swerves the bubble boat to the left.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Eeh! Oh!}}
{{L|''[A passing driver makes Mrs. Puff's bubble boat spin around. The bubble boat hits two other drivers and bounces off into another street. Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob are driving in a one-way street and almost get hit by other drivers.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Ah!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff move around in the bubble boat in panic.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff's bubble boat hits Nathiel Waters' bubble boat.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh! ''[inflates herself and pops her bubble boat]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob was sent flying into the ground. He pulls his head out of the sand.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff's inflated body causes a pileup in the middle of the road. The bubble boats send Mrs. Puff and the other drivers flying to the surface.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface?}}
{{L|''[The bubble boats reach the surface and they pop, sending everyone falling downward. SpongeBob quickly takes out his bubble soap and blows a lot of bubbles. SpongeBob's bubbles catches and saves everyone.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Doh!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob blows one last bubble to save Mrs. Puff.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[wipes the soap off]'' No more bubbles. Get them off me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles? ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Motorcycle Cop|''[takes bubble wand]'' Give me that! Bubble boats are too unstable. They've been declared illegal. Everyone back to your regular boats! ''[breaks the bubble wand and leaves]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! ♪La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la♪}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[inflates herself]'' Oh, joy. ''[pops]''}}
