{{L|''[SpongeBob and Sandy are on the bus]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't wait to see the ancient rains, I even brought an umbrella. ''[opens umbrella]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Ancient ruins, not rains. ''[the bus stops, everyone gets out of the bus and goes to the ancient ruins, Sandy takes a photo using her camera]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gee, Sandy! I can't wait to see the inside.}}
{{L|Sandy|Behold! The uncharted caverns of Lemuria. Now remember, SpongeBob, this place is filled with delicate artifacts, don't touch anything.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[smiles]'' Hey look, an ancient Lamorian toilet plunger, ''[SpongeBob pulls the lever]'' he-he sorry. ''[a twisted pentagon entrance appears, Sandy and SpongeBob walk inside]'' This place is sure a Brain Twister.}}
{{L|Sandy|I'm losing track of which way is up in here.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I'd say up is... ''[points his finger behind them]'' Oh, that way.}}
{{L|Sandy|Up is that way?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yep.}}
{{L|Sandy|Then that means... ''[the screen turns sideways]'' Oh, boy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Sandy|Ahh...! ''[falling and screaming, Sandy and SpongeBob stop falling, SpongeBob is still screaming then stops slowly]''}}
{{L|Sandy|We're ok, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! Ok.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Sandy|''[They walk into a different room]'' Wow!}}
{{L|Sandy|Looks like some sort of control module or maybe a holographic projector. ''[Sandy places her hands on the activation circles]'' Whoops! Well, I guess we're gonna find out what this doohickey does. ''[machine opens]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[A diamond prism comes out]'' Ooh, purty.}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob, no! ''[The prism fires a laser]'' Look out! ''[The laser hits the top of Sandy's tail and it's hair and skin burns off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's it doing? ''[The laser hits a crystal and aims at two diamonds, they soon come out the walls in tubes and make direct contact]''}}
{{L|Sandy|This place sure got a friendlying hurry. ''[Three pieces of the tube spin, when it stops three holes pop out three steel balls]'' Duck! ''[SpongeBob and Sandy duck, the three balls land in three robot bodies, their faces and arms come out and go to SpongeBob and Sandy]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aw! Look, cute. ''[Two robots trap Sandy and SpongeBob inside magic bubbles]'' Kinda reminds me of bubble blowing. ''[The bubbles rise up, the three robots, Sandy, and SpongeBob go into a new room, the bubbles pop and Sandy and SpongeBob crash]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Whoa, what is this place?}}
{{L|Robot #1|You now stand in the most sacred place in all of Lemuria.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[SpongeBob walks up to a glowing sculpture]'' Mesmerizing.}}
{{L|Robot #1|I see you are an art lover, the sculpture of the Sphere Laser Dichotomy, it really holds the room together.}}
{{L|Sandy|I didn't realize the Lemurias were a race of robots.}}
{{L|Robot #1|Not originally. ''[Flashback]'' The Lemurias actually created us as a legion of janitor bots, and that's what we did until the great disaster. ''[Huge explosion]'' But, when we realized that we were the only survivors, we took it upon ourselves to maintain the technology and customs of the once great civilization. ''[Back to the present]'' That's not to say it's been easy, it's been a couple of millennia.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh! Really, really, mesmerizing. ''[SpongeBob's touch destroys the sculpture, the ruins start to fall apart]''}}
{{L|Robot #1|You fools, what have you done? We told you, it "really" holds the room together.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry, I didn't think you meant it literally!}}
{{L|''[The Ruins are destroyed, everyone gasp]''}}
{{L|Narrator|Two Days Later.....}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Sandy and SpongeBob survived the disaster]'' Gee, I feel bad for those poor robots, they worked so hard to keep this place clean.}}
{{L|Sandy|Speaking of which.}}
{{L|Robot #1|''[The robots are doing a campfire]'' Those two idiots.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, please forgive me robots, I didn't mean to ruin your ruins.}}
{{L|Robot #1|Oh, what's the point. Our way of life has been destroyed, we no longer have a purpose.}}
{{L|''[The robots move to a different spot]''}}
{{L|Robot #3|Looks like a good place to just dry out in the sun. ''[The robots shut themselves down]''}}{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, hey, don't be down. I know just the thing to get you out of this funk.}}
{{L|''[Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk into the restroom]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How's it going, guys?}}
{{L|Robot #2|Wonderful.}}
{{L|Robot #3|Very fulfilled!}}
{{L|Robot #1|''[uses his toilet plunger]'' Thank you, you have restored our dignity.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uh, how much are these tin cans gonna cost me?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not a penny, they're just doing what they were made to do.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No thanks, SpongeBob, I'm already not paying you to clean the toilets.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, but Mr. Krabs, I did accidentally destroy their way of life.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' Just fooling, sonny, and besides, why would I start saying no to free labor now?}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and the three robots laugh.]''}}
