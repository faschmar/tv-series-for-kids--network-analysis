{{L|''[opening shot of The Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Ahhh... The Krusty Krab, Bikini Bottom's answer to fine dining. And here we see one of its patrons now. ''[Patrick runs away from the back of the Krusty Krab dropping grease across his path]'' Ah... yes, moving on. Oh, it is the SpongeBob, creator of the fine cuisine within. Now let us watch.}}
{{L|Squidward|One Krabby Patty, extra grease. ''[SpongeBob chuckles and flips a page in his book.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa!}} 
{{L|Squidward|Mmm.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh! ''[he starts laughing]''}} 
{{L|Squidward|''[growls]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|''[he laughs more and flips a page]'' ''[Gasps and moans]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Grr...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[he gasps again and laughs even more]''}}
{{L|Squidward|All right, let me see it. ''[he picks up the book that SpongeBob was looking at]'' The Krusty Krab work schedule, what's so great about this?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' What's so... why, it's my happy book. The Krusty Krab is where all of my happiest memories occurred.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hmmm... ''[drops SpongeBob's book]'' Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, Squidward. ''[walks to his cabinet and opens it]'' I have a whole cabinet of backups. ''[Squidward deflates]'' So what's ''your'' happiest memory, Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|Ummm, let me think...  ''[A thought bubble appears. Inside it, a video of TV static zooms in. Then it cuts to the color bars screen. The thought bubble disappears.]'' ''[sighs]'' I guess I don't have a happiest memory. Oh, well. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob thinks and he pops out from Squidward's boat]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Yes?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, you don't have a happiest memory?}}
{{L|Squidward|So what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How can you live without a happiest memory? Do you cry yourself to sleep at night?}}
{{L|Squidward|I hear you crying all the time.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy.}}
{{L|Squidward|Look, I don't need a happy memory, so just get back to your culinary grease factory and leave me alone.}}
{{L|Sandals|Hey, I'd like to order a Krabby Patty, please. ''[Squidward bursts into tears, bawling hysterically]'' Okay... can someone else take my order?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob appears out from Squidward's boat again and cries with him.]''}} 
{{L|Sandals|''[annoyed]'' I'll wait.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob continues crying.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[crying]'' You're right, SpongeBob, I don't have a happy memory. This is horrible!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sniffs]'' Really? Do you think you can?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[puts his arm around Squidward]'' No problem.}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, it's against my better judgement, but, okay. ''[SpongeBob squeals with excitement]''}}
{{L|''[At a concert, a song plays.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You love music, right, Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|Mmm hmm.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey, this isn't so bad. I think I actually feel kinda...happy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|See? Your happiest memory is forming!}}
{{L|''[Nat plays his violin but his bow launches from it]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oops. That was a sour note. ''[Notices the violin bow on Squidward's eye]''}}
{{L|Squidward|This is not my happiest memory...}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to the Museum]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Why are we at the Art Museum?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, you love art. Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!}}
{{L|Squidward|Great... I get to see all the art of people who have succeeded where I've failed. My art will never be shown in this... ''[Walks into a statue resembling him]''  What the? This... this is my sculpture! How did it get here?}}
{{L|Curator|''[Walks up to Squidward's sculpture along with a group of fish]'' Oh! You're just in time! Art lovers, this is Squidward Tentacles! Creator of this piece! ''[The group is in awe]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! Your work at a museum, Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Excited]'' Gosh! I can't believe it! I think this might be it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Your happiest memory?}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah!}}
{{L|Curator|And now the performance artist Fiasco will say a few words about this piece ''[camera shifts over to Fiasco]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Gosh! Fiasco himself is talking about my art!}}
{{L|Fiasco|Ahem! Squid... ward... go toward... the light... ''[takes out a flamethrower]'' of my flamethrower! ''[burns down Squidward's sculpture and the Art Critic's group claps for him]''}}
{{L|Squidward|And now he's melted it... ''[Fiasco takes away the sign "Created by Squidward Tentacles" and replaces it with "Burned by Fiasco"]'' Not a happiest memory...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um... it's kinda smokey in here! ''[grabs Squidward's arm]'' You need fresh air!}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward (who is blindfolded) in a hot air balloon]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What a majestic view!}}
{{L|Squidward|What view?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh yeah! I forgot about your blindfold! ''[removes Squidward's blindfold]'' Isn't it beautiful?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[looks down at his house]'' Very nice... except that I'm ''[scared]'' afraid of heights!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! Sorry Squidward! I'll take us down! ''[takes out a needle]''}}
{{L|Squidward| What?! No! ''[SpongeBob pops the balloon]'' Oh boy... ''[he and SpongeBob start flying around and crash into a mountain. He knocks away the basket and notices SpongeBob's butt]'' Oh yeah... nice view...}}
{{L|Harold|''[reaches the top]'' Son of a seahorse! Twenty years of training and a couple of amateurs just leap out of a balloon! Here! ''[gives SpongeBob his flag]'' You plant it! ''[walks back down]'' All that time and money and resources wasted on...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey! We're the first to ever reach the top of Mt. Bikini! Surely that makes for a happiest memory! I claim this mountain in the name of Squidward Tentacles! ''[accidentally jams the flag onto Squidward's foot]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[removes the flag from his foot and notices the mountain starting to shake]'' Uh oh...''[the snow starts to carry him and SpongeBob down the mountain]''}}
{{L|Harold|Stupid amateurs... ''[stops walking and notices the snow]'' Fantastic... ''[the snow carries him, SpongeBob, and Squidward onto Conch Street]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Time to face facts. I'll never have a happiest memory. ''[opens the snow up like a door and walks out then turns to SpongeBob]'' And if I do, it definitely won't involve you. ''[closes the snow door on SpongeBob and locks it; then walks inside his house and closes the door]'' Hello misery... I'm home... ''[walks up the stairs and gets on his bed]'' I might as well go to bed for a hundred years or so. ''[lays down in bed]'' Wake me when I'm dead... ''[rolls under his bed and sighs]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Two weeks later...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[at his house]'' Gary, I am worried about Squidward. He hasn't come out of his house for two weeks now!}}
{{L|Gary|''meow eow-ow.''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[knocks Squidward's door]'' Why isn't he answering? ''[looks through Squidward's mail slot]'' Squidward! Squidward! Now I'm really worried! Squidward! Squidward! ''[notices Squidward through the window]'' Gasp! Squidward! Down here! He's upstairs! ''[near Squidward's window will sitting on top of Gary; then knocks on the window]'' Hey! Hey! Squidward! ''[Squidward pulls the blinds down on both windows]'' Well at least we know that he is still alive. Uh oh... ''[Gary's shell falls off and SpongeBob lands on the ground; then runs into Squidward's house and Gary's shell cracks off of him]'' I'm okay Gary!}}
{{L|Gary|Meow...}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to inside SpongeBob's house and near the phone]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward sure seems depressed. I think I'll call him to cheer him up! ''[starts calling Squidward and he picks up the phone]'' Hello? Squidward? Are you there? ''[Squidward throws his phone out his window and into SpongeBob's house]'' Squidward? Are you there? Squidward?}}
{{L|Gary|Mrow?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gary? What are you doing at Squidward's? Uh Gare? Can you put Squidward on the phone? ''[Notices Gary trying to give him another phone and takes it]'' Hold on a second, someone is on the other line. ''[echoing]'' Hello? Hello!? Hello!? ''[Squidward's phone breaks]'' Hello? ''[his phone then breaks]''}}
<font color="red">{{L|Squidward|I just can't seem to get happy... ''[opens his oven and takes out burned brownies]'' Well, that didn't help...''</font>[hears ringing; then walks over to his phone]'' Huh? That's strange, I could have swear I just threw that darn phone away. ''[notices his fax machine]'' Oh yeah. My fax machine. Now, why did I buy that again?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[emerges from the fax machine and is in paper form]'' Hi, Squidward! ''[Squidward grabs him]'' You sure are a hard man to get a hold of! ''[sniffs]'' Hey, do I smell brownies?}}
{{L|Squidward|Yes... ''[tosses SpongeBob into the paper shredder and picks the box up]'' Thanks for stopping by. ''[dumps SpongeBob out of his window then closes it]''}}
{{L|Gary|(sighs) meow. ''[gathers up the bits of SpongeBob and puts him back together]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks Gary! I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory. These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!}}
<font color="red">{{L|Squidward|''[grabs a rope]'' I can't seem to get happy... ''[swings the rope over]'' Maybe this will help. ''[pulls on the rope to reveal a scallop in a cage but it sprays unknown liquid at him and the cage falls on his face; the scallop then flies away]'' Nope... I guess not... ''</font>[hears knocking]'' Oh great... I wonder who that could be... ''[looks through the mail slot and notices the Mailfish]'' You're not SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Mailfish|I have a package for a Squidward "Tentaclees"?}}
{{L|Squidward|"Tentacles". Yes that's me.}}
{{L|Mailfish|Well, here you go. ''[gives Squidward the package]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Thanks... ''[closes his door]'' Doesn't say who's it from. No doubt SpongeBob is hiding inside. Ah well, here goes nothing. ''[opens the package]'' Gotcha! Huh? ''[notices it empty]'' It's empty. Empty, just like my miserable life! ''[SpongeBob emerges from the box]'' I see nothing but darkness ahead... ''[SpongeBob tapes him in another box]'' SpongeBob!? ''[starts muffling as SpongeBob takes him to the Krusty Krab; SpongeBob then opens the box]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Surprise. I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up. Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick, but don't worry, I used my papier mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person: me! ''[camera zooms out to show the Krusty Krab filled with papier mâché SpongeBobs]'' So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?}}
{{L|Squidward|You don't seem to understand. ''[starts to get angry]'' I... don't... want... ''[angry skulls appear in his eyes, saying what he's saying]'' a... happiest memory! ''[starts to go crazy and destroys the cake]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[talking to a papier mâché SpongeBob]'' So you enjoying the hors d'oeuvres?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[rips the papier mâché SpongeBob apart then saws more apart; then crawls to the ceiling and grabs the banner that says "Happy Happiest Memory Squidward" and kicks more of them away]'' I feel wonderful! ''[Laughs maniacally and destroys more papier mâché SpongeBobs]'' This is it, my happiest memory!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sigh... he's so handsome!}}
