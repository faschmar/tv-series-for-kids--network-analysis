{{L|''[Episode starts in Jellyfish Fields, with a clam on top of the sign. He then gets out a breath spray. As soon as the sun rises, he coughs, instead of crowing. We now see SpongeBob and Patrick waiting at the main entrance.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks at his watch]'' Just two more minutes, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[looks at his watch, although he doesn't have one]'' Yup!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Look! Here he comes! ''[The jellyfishing ranger passes them]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Who?}}
{{L|''[The jellyfishing ranger switches the "closed" sign to "open." He looks at SpongeBob and Patrick.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thank you, Mr. Ranger.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, thanks. ''[both breathing]''}}
{{L|Ranger|Yes?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aren't you forgetting something?}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, something.}}
{{L|Ranger|''[grabs his eyeballs and lets go of them]'' Please show me your-- ''[SpongeBob and Patrick show him their jellyfishing licenses]'' jellyfishing licenses.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and go in, ignoring the "Open/Closed" sign they knocked over]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[catches a three-spot jellyfish]'' Patrick, look! I caught a rare breed a glowing three-spot.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, I caught one, too! This one's a five-spot. ''[although it is a one-spot]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sniffles]'' Patrick, guess what?}}
{{L|Patrick|You like it here so much, you feel yourself being moved to a song?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, yes, how did you guess?}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, I kinda feel the movement coming on myself.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's just start with the song.}}
{{L|Patrick|You mean "The Jellyfishing Song"?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's the one.}}
{{L|''[both breathe in deeply, throw off their goggles and nets, and then start to sing in silly fashion]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|♪Jelly lelly lelly jelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jellyfishing song!♪ ''[jellyfish claps]''♪Jelly lelly lelly jelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, everyone sing along!♪ ''[jellyfish claps. Patrick picks up SpongeBob, starts spinning him around, and throws him through the air; next scene shows SpongeBob and Patrick hanging onto a jellyfish's tentacles, while still singing the Jellyfishing Song'. they are singing on a desert island, surrounded by jellyfish clapping in rhythm, in calypso]''♪I go jellyfishing in da' morn'in,♪}}
{{L|Patrick|''[singing in calypso]''♪I jellyfish all da' night!♪}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[singing in calypso]''♪jellyfishing in da' afternoon,♪}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[singing in calypso]''♪Jellyfishing make me feel all right!♪}}
{{L|''[next shows them running through Jellyfish Fields, singing the Jellyfishing Song]''}}
{{L|Coral|''[sings in deep opera voice]''♪Everyone singgggggggg♪ ''[A jellyfish performs a drumroll and Patrick and SpongeBob rise out of his mouth]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|♪Everyone sing along!♪ ''[a jellyfish beats on his drum]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Isn't it great that these majestic creatures have Jellyfish Fields to call their home?}}
{{L|Patrick|You bet! And it's highway convenient too, according to that big sign!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[turns around and jumps when he sees a big billboard for Shelly Super Highway]'' Big sign? I didn't see a big- Jumping Jellyfish! That's a big sign!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[reading the board]'' It says, "Future site of the Shelly Super Highway."}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[horrified]'' Super highway!? Do you know what this means?!}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, it’s sorta like other roads, except there's no sto-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I know what a superhighway is! I mean for all this jellyfish! For us! For Jellyfish Fiel-''[pulls on Patrick's skin, and accidentally rips off two pieces]''-ds, uh sorry. ''[sticks the pieces back on]''}}
{{L|Patrick|So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single species of flora and fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, yeah, that's a simplified version, yeah, something like that, ''[angrily takes off his goggles]'' which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, "Shelly Super Highway," from ever being built!}}
{{L|''[Scene now takes place in Goo Lagoon, with Larry the Lobster lifting on a barbell.]''}}
{{L|Larry|1,397, 1,398-- ''[SpongeBob appears on one of the weight plates of the barbell]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Larry, you gotta help me stop the highway!}}
{{L|Larry|Can't right now, bro. I got about 4,098 more reps to do. ''[SpongeBob slides out of the barbell, causing the other weight plate to lose Larry's balance.. Another scene takes place outside Shady Shoals, with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy sitting on a bench]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy! Certainly with superpowers like yours, we can stop this superhighway! ''[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy still in silence. APATHY! appears, then switches back to the scene]'' Hmmm.}}
{{L|''[scene now outside Squidward's house]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I actually would like to help, but I'm just too busy right now.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Too busy doing what?}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm too busy telling you, "No!" ''[slams the door, with SpongeBob all in pieces. scene in the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is seen cleaning the tables, while whistling. He then notices SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Private SpongeBob! Ahoy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[depressed]'' Captain Mr. Krabs, ahoy.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Why SpongeBob, that's not your usual four-fingered salute.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm just upset because they're building a highway over Jellyfish Fields. ''[sniffles]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, SpongeBob, I'd sure hate me customers to see you like this. Is there anything I can do to help?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Really, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Sure, why not?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Mr. Krabs! I just know that together, we can stop that nasty old highway from going right through Jellyfish Fields!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[puzzled]'' Uh, you're not talking about the Shelly Superhighway, are ya?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, why?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uh well, 'cause I'm actually in favor of that highway being built.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gibberish, possibly trying to say "no" or "what?!", while pulling on his eyeballs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[smiling, walks over to a poster with charts and maps on it]'' Yes! I've already calculated how many new customers I'll get once it's finished. You can see for yourself in this series of these charts and diagrams I have displayed!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sniffles, brushes away a tear]'' Charts and dia- ''[his eyes widen, horrified]'' Mr. Krabs! Didn't you see!?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob| This. ''[folds out the rest of the diagram map]'' According to these plans. After the Shelly Superhighway goes right through Jellyfish Fields, it goes right over the Krusty Krab! Look, there you are, decrepit and living in a cardboard box! Then, it goes through a loop-de-loop for some reason, and goes right through the front door of the Chum Bucket!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[horrified, then furious]'' What!? Who approved this plan!?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[starts to read off the map, while Mr. Krabs' eyes widen]'' "Plan approved by and sponsored by Sheldon J. Plankton Enterprises, a division of No Fun Incorporated!"}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[angrily punches his claws together]'' C'mon, boy! Let's you and I go over and show that Plankton a piece of our minds!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[smiling, rips off a corner of his head and hands it to Mr. Krabs]'' Think this piece will get the point across?}}
{{L|''[cut to them walking over to the Chum Bucket]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[yells]'' Alright, Plankton! It's Eugene Krabs, here, with, What's-His-Name! Now c'mon out!}}
{{L|Plankton|I can't.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|C'mon outside, and take what's coming to ya!}}
{{L|Plankton|I really can't come outside!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why not!?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[shows him literally right in front of them, and yells angrily]'' Because I'm already out here, you bumbling barnacles! Open your eyes, for cryin' out loud!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob look down and see Plankton]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, right.}}
{{L|Plankton|Now what's this all about, anyway?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Don't play coy with us, Shelly. We both know you've been up to no good. Now start talking.}}
{{L|Plankton|All right, so I've been stealing your mail for the past five years, big whoop.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not that!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What? You've been what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're talking about that new superhighway you're planning on building, and in case you didn't know, it's gonna destroy Jellyfish Fields. Not to mention that your plan is stupid and dumb and dumb and stupid.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wait a minute. You've been what?}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I don't know.}}
{{L|Plankton|Forget it. Even if I wanted to stop the Shelly Superhighway from being built, it would be impossible.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why?}}
{{L|Plankton|Because the whole city has already approved it! See for yourself, through this conveniently-timed flashback.}}
{{L|''[the scene now takes place in the Bikini Bottom Town Hall and Fun Center, where the voting for the superhighway is held]''}}
{{L|Mayor|Order. Order. Order in the Meeting Hall. ''[pounds the gavel on one of the guard's heads. The guard puts his hat back on his head when the mayor stops]'' Now all those in favor of paving over Jellyfish Fields and building the Shelly Superhighway, raise your right fin and say "aye."}}
{{L|Everyone|Aye!}}
{{L|Mayor|Now everyone else, just sit there, quietly.}}
{{L|Fish 1|I like highways.}}
{{L|Fish 2|I like things that are super.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And I like saying, "aye."}}
{{L|''[scene is back at the Chum Bucket]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, why did I say "aye"?}}
{{L|Plankton|Seems as though the ayes have it. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got superhighway preparations to be attending to. Toodles!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs now walk towards the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What are we gonna do now, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, I'm gonna do the only thing I can do when me character is tested by insurmountable odds: lie on me back and sob loudly.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Normally, Mr. Krabs, I would lie on my back and sob loudly too, but I am not giving up! There's still one citizen in Bikini Bottom who won't sit still in the face on this outrageous injustice!}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to the song Give Jellyfish Fields A Chance, with SpongeBob and Patrick handing out fliers on Jellyfish Fields to two fish, but they just throw them away]''}}

{{L|SpongeBob|It's working, Patrick! They're booing the highway! Looks like our message has really gotten through to the people! Let's play a song while their hearts are open! ''[a sheet of paper flies in his face]'' Hey wait a minute. This is one of our fliers! They're pelting us with our own pamphlets! ''[to Patrick]'' What does this mean!}}
{{L|Patrick|I, couldn't tell you.}}
{{L|Nat|I'll tell you what it means! It means this! ''[grabs the tambourine and stomps on it]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[confused]'' It means, you hate tambourines?}}
{{L|Fish|No! It means- ''[is interrupted by police who come up in their car]''}}
{{L|Police Fish #1|Alright, you guys the highway haters?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes sir, but with good reason. You see, without Jellyfish Fields, jellyfish will have to find a new home and- ''[he and Patrick are put in handcuffs]''}}
{{L|Police Fish #2|Alright, you two. You're under arrest!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What for?}}
{{L|Police Fish #1|Unlicensed use of a sitar!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[confused]'' But, my grandma gave me this sitar! It didn't come with a license.}}
{{L|Police Fish #2|''[raises the baton]'' Yeah well, neither did this! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick are dragged away by police while crowd behind them yells, "Highway! Highway!"]'' ''[cut to the police car getting driven out of town]''}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, I'll never forget what my great-uncle Cletus said right before he was arrested during a freedom march.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What was that?}}
{{L|Patrick|It's when a bunch of people go walkin' on the street, an-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[annoyed]'' I know what a freedom march is Patrick! I mean, what did he say?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh. ''[chuckles]'' He said, "Let not your heart walk away from you, let your mind grow legs and follow it."}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[impressed]'' Wow. Your uncle sounds like a pretty smart guy, Patrick! What happened to him after he was arrested?}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know, he was ever heard from him again. ''[SpongeBob looks nervous. the police car stops in the middle of nowhere and throws SpongeBob and Patrick out, and then drive away, kicking up dust and blowing away their clothes, leaving them in their underwear]''}}
{{L|Police Fish #1|See ya later, longhairs! ''[drives away]''}}
{{L|Patrick and SpongeBob|Bye!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|See you later!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks for the lift!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[horrified]'' They left us, out here in the middle of nowhere!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, this isn't the middle of nowhere; We're actually on the edge of nowhere! ''[points to a sign that says: "Now entering Nowhere. Population: 0]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[smiles weakly]'' Well, at least it isn't raining!}}
{{L|''[a single small thundercloud in the entire sky starts to pour rain right above where SpongeBob and Patrick are. A scene cuts to a miserable SpongeBob and Patrick sitting in a rain puddle. Rain stops as one of SpongeBob's fliers float by, remotivating him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[angrily]'' I'm not ready to give up just yet!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[gleefully]'' I am!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|If we could just come up with a better way to reach the people, something everyone can see and hear!}}
{{L|Patrick|You mean like a parade?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh a parade! Patrick, how did you come up with such a brilliant idea?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[points to the left]'' There's one going by right there. ''[shows two fish with a banner saying "Shelly Super Highway"; followed by a marching band; followed by a float and the circus; followed by Santa on a tropical island on a limo; followed by a herd of senior citizens being whipped at by the two wrestlers from Krusty Krushers: followed by a group of Scottish fish playing bagpipes; followed by some clown fish and a cat parade balloon: followed by a choir: and finally followed by a heavy metal rock band]''.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That certainly is a parade!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[points]'' Look!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps at Plankton in a complex paver/bulldozer hybrid following everyone]'' Plankton! Driving a big tractor! This doesn't look good at all, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Does this?! ''[flexes his back]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|C'mon! Let's go follow them! ''[follows the parade while Patrick still flexes, the parade stops, and Plankton gets out a loud speaker]''}}
{{L|Plankton|People of Bikini Bottom- ''[crowd starts to murmur and ignore him, until a Scottish fish points at him]''}}
{{L|Scottish fish| Look, up there.}}
{{L|Plankton|Today marks the new- ''[is cut of again by the crowd]'' Stop murmuring! ''[everyone is silent]'' Thank you. And as I was saying, today marks the beginning of a new- ''[is interrupted by the crowd singing, "For He's A Jolly Good Fellow"]'' ''[angrily]'' Shut up! ''[crowd stop immediately]'' Today marks a new beginning for Bikini Bottom! ''[crowd cheers and confetti falls]'' Now, it’s time to pave our way down the road to success! ''[starts the paver/bulldozer hybrid while the band plays, and starts to make the highway, which makes all of the jellyfish pack their bags and fly away; he laughs evilly. sniffs the air, and then sighs]'' Ah, I love the smell of hot tar in the morning! Yeah baby! ''[stops in front of a matador/band member with his hat covering his face]'' Hey you there! Are you trying to get yourself crushed!?}}
{{L|''[takes off his hat, revealing SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[furious]'' I won't let you do it, Plankton! If you're going to pave over Jellyfish Fields, you're going to have to pave over me first! ''[shows he and Plankton dramatically locking eyes, and quickly shows some surprised members of the parade]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[simply smiles]'' Ooh! Your wish is my command, Sponge! ''[angrily pushes the levers forward, crushing SpongeBob. shows SpongeBob crushed, clearly in agony]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[weakly]'' Is that all you got? ''[covered in tar; next scene shows the parade continuing, Plankton still paving, the jellyfish moving, and Jellyfish Fields being transformed into a desolate, lifeless wasteland. SpongeBob gets out of a manhole, looking very sad, and sees Patrick playing a trumpet]'' Knock it off, Patrick.}}
{{L|''[next scene shows the Shelly Super Highway going through Jellyfish Fields into a severely polluted Bikini Bottom, and shows the graffiti concrete pillars holding up the road arch over the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[miserable]'' I used to dream of a restaurant that have an "easy highway access!"}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks sad too]'' Yeah, but this is more like "highway excess!"}}
{{L|Squidward|''[shows up]'' Well, I'm going to go soak my tentacles. ''[shivers]'' It's cold in here under all this concrete!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[looks hopeful]'' But Squidward, we can't leave! What if we have, a customer?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sarcastically]'' Really. We haven't had a customer since the day this highway was built!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sheepishly]'' uh, Squidward, it's technically its a super-highway.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[angrily]'' I don't care what it is! I'm out of here!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[shocked]'' But Squidward- ''[is interrupted by Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[looks sad]'' No, no SpongeBob. Squidward's right. ''[gets up and walks to his office]'' I think it's high time we started accepting facts. ''[SpongeBob runs over to a fax machine and pulls out a new one]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[smiles]'' I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[annoyed]'' No boyo! Not that kind!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[confused]'' Mr. Krabs, what are you saying?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[darkly]'' The Krusty Krab can't stay in business. Not like this.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It can't?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No SpongeBob. It's time to activate Plan Z-99.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Z-99!? ''[is horrified, and his eyes nearly shoots out of his head, and faints landing in Squidward's hands]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Eugene, what is plan Z-99!? And more importantly, how does it affect me!?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Plan Z-99 is, ''[a truck passes over]'' I'm-''[is interrupted by traffic honking and driving]'' I'm-''[is interrupted again, and then yells quickly during next honks]'' I'm selling the Krabby Patty secret formula to Plankton!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[shocked]'' Eugene!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sadly]'' I have no choice. And stop calling me Eugene. ''[walks out of Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Tell me I'm dreaming! ''[moans]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[looks sad]'' Not this time, little fella. ''[sniffles. It shows Mr. Krabs outside, and changes the "Open" sign to say "Closed" as he sobs. Cut to the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is rich, successful, and getting a back massage from Karen, via an electric plug]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Uh, lower, a little lower, yeah, that's it! ''[doorbell rings, and Plankton rides to the door on a segway]'' Now who could that be during my hour of triumph? ''[shows a miserable Mr. Krabs holding the Secret Formula]'' How appropriate. ''[snickers]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Plankton, I'm ready to negotiate a price for me secret formula.}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, goody! ''[gets out a large pocketwatch]'' Let me just wind my watch!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[very sad]'' What for?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[gleefully]'' 'Cause I'm gonna love every minute of this! ''[a faint buzzing is heard]'' Did you hear that? Karen, is that you?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[points up to a vent]'' Up there! ''[a massive amount of jellyfish come out of it]'' Whoa nelly!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[outside]'' First I lost Jellyfish Fields, and- and......}}
{{L|Squidward|And what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in a sobbing mess]'' And now I lost the only job I ever wanted! ''[cries]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Look at it this way, I don't have to see you every day now! Ha, this could be the start of something beautiful! ''[a jellyfish stings him]'' OW! What in the name of-!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gleefully]'' Squidward, look!}}
{{L|Squidward|What am I looking- ''[screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|All the jellyfish who used to live in Jellyfish Fields are coming to Bikini Bottom!}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah, but for some reason, I don't think it's to distribute holiday gift baskets!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aw, ya don't? ''[he and Squidward run away as the town turns into chaos]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[back in the Chum Bucket]'' Uh. You know, Plankton? Let's just talk about this later. I think I'm just gonna run for me life. ''[runs out the door, closing it behind him]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[horrified]'' Wait! I'm coming with you! ''[before Plankton can escape, the jellyfish grab him]'' Nooooo! ''[jellyfish sting him]'' Not the eye! Not the eye!}}
{{L|Ben|Chaos runs rampant in Bikini Bottom.

{{L|Bill|Am I on television?}}
{{L|Ben|Yes sir, you are, would you care to say a few words about the-}}
{{L|Bill|''[grabs the mike]'' Hi, Mom, hi, Dad. Hey, Dr. Slieen. ''[SpongeBob is seen running away from jellyfish in the background]'' Hey, Jennifer, hey, Sally, hey, Francis, hey, Mable, ''[Ben's face turns into an annoyed look]'' hey, Julie, hey, Abigail.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[panting still running then notices the News]'' Ah! Now they'll have to listen! ''[runs to Ben and Bill]''}}
{{L|Bill|And there's my pals in El Tuna, and the gang at the Pudgy Flipper... ''[Ben pushes him away]''}}
{{L|Ben|Uh, thank you. ''[SpongeBob skids in] ''Hello, little boy, how about saying a few words into the camera about the current crisis?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, okay, I guess. Sorry I am a little nervous.}}
{{L|Ben|That's understandable, just speak loud and clear.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, all I have to say is that, um, well, ''[yells]'' Stop the madness! We need to get Jellyfish Fields back to the jellyfish, which will restore their natural habitat, so they will be in peace. And balance will once again restore to their natural land. So what do you say, everybody? Will you help me?}}
{{L|Everybody|No!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[confused]'' You're kidding, right?}}
{{L|Everybody|Yes!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well all right! Everybody, follow me.}}
{{L|''[Everybody runs over the cameraman to Jellyfish Fields.. The scene cuts to SpongeBob in the tractor ready to tear down the Shelly Superhighway]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay everyone, say goodbye to the worst thing that's happened to this town since 97 cent stores.}}
{{L|Everyone|Yeah! ''[SpongeBob tries to break the highway with the tractor, but it just stopped]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Good effort, Spongedope, but you can't tear up my highway, it's indestructible!}}
{{L|Larry|Not if we have anything to do with it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Larry Lobster!}}
{{L|Larry|That's right, pal, but that's not all. ''[Sandy walks out from the crowd, waving]''}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Harder still!}}
{{L|Fish 3|You heard the little square guy, yeah! ''[Everybody lines up behind the tractor and pushes it]''}}
