{{L|''[Nat rides on a seahorse while the camera pans to SpongeBuck and a seahorse]''}}
{{L|Announcer|In the old west, it's central to understand the basics of riding a seahorse. Are you ready, SpongeBuck?}}
{{L|SpongeBuck|I sure am.}}
{{L|Announcer|Fine. To start, ''[SpongeBuck is shown on the screen while the arrows are also shown]'', we place the right hand on the saddle horn. Then place your right foot in the stirrup located here while placing your hand there.}}
{{L|SpongeBuck|Okay. Right foot here. ''[Puts right foot on the saddle horn]''}}
{{L|Announcer|Keeping your left leg balanced in ready here.}}
{{L|SpongeBuck|Left foot here. ''[Puts left foot on the saddle horn]'' Right arm there. ''[Puts hand on seahorse's tail]''}}
{{L|Announcer|Well, sliding your index finger there with that left toe push up over to the upright mounting position with the foot ending on the opposite side of the back front.}}
{{L|SpongeBuck|Left there and ''[Hops on seahorse]'' voila!}}
{{L|Announcer|Well, all right. You're ready to ride.}}
