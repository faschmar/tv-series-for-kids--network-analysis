{{L|Perch Perkins|Food truck, food truck.}}
{{L|Campers|Food truck, food truck, food truck, food truck, food truck.}}
{{L|Sandy|Hoo-ee, everyone's hungrier than a termite in a submarine.}}
{{L|Patrick|I've had to eat dead bugs all weekend... And they taste terrible. You want some?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, I'm okay. Mr. Plankton, why do you always run out of food every week?}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, you can blame that skinflint Krabs. He only buys camp food week to week, and you slobs eat all of it by Friday. Do the math.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Math? In summer?}}
{{L|Campers|Ew... Hooray!}}
{{L|Plankton|Whoa, girl, whoa. Who's a pretty food truck? You are, that's who. I'll tickle your doors. I'll tickle your doors! Okay, cutie pie. Show us the food. Shoes?! Who ordered shoes?}}
{{L|Patrick|Um, I'll have one olive loafer, and a pair of pickled heels.}}
{{L|Sandy|Where's the food truck?! 'Cause this obviously ain't it. Yah! Get. Our growing bodies need vittles.}}
{{L|Campers|Yeah, vittles!}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, kids, I-I don't know what to tell you. Sometimes food trucks need to go and be food trucks, and drive unleaded, in the wild. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to figure out our new shoe-based menu. Get off!}}
{{L|Sandy|Okay, y'all. Looks like if we wanna eat, we're gonna have to form a posse, and hunt down that food truck ourselves.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Hold your pretty ponies, prissy. If there's any posse forming to be done, we'll be doing it!}}
{{L|Larry|Yeah, 'cause we're the counselors, and we're big and strong!}}
{{L|Squidward|What?! Yeah.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass and Larry|Yeah! Truck hunt, truck hunt, truck hunt, truck hunt, truck hunt, truck hunt!}}
{{L|Sandy|Anywho, I think if we just follow them there tire tracks from last week's delivery, we'll be having breakfast by lunchtime. But first, we're gonna need to arm ourselves.}}
{{L|Sandy|Yeah. The weapon of choice when hunting down a truck. Grab a dipstick, you dipstick.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Ooh! Dipstick, dipstick, dipstick!}}
{{L|Sandy|Food truck, food truck, food truck, food truck!}}
{{L|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy|Food truck, food truck, food truck, food truck, food truck!}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Save some for me!}}
{{L|Larry|Can't, go on. Too, hungry.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Mother, I want my num-nums. ''[cries]''}}
{{L|Squidward|So much for big and strong. I guess it's up to me to save us. Right, jellyfish jelly, coming right up. Typical.}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh no, the tracks are gone.}}
{{L|Patrick|Sorry, it must be something I didn't eat.}}
{{L|Sandy|No silly, that weren't your innards a-honking. That was the food truck!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It came from over there.}}
{{L|Patrick|Food truck, food truck, food truck, food truck, food truck, food truck!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Sandy|Oh no! Bubble sand!}}
{{L|Patrick|Food truck, food truck, food truck, food truck, food truck!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hold your breath, Patrick! I'm coming!}}
{{L|Sandy|No! The truck is this way, Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh yeah, right.}}
{{L|Sandy|Let's go.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Sandy|The counselors are eating each other!}}
{{L|Larry, Squidward, and Bubble Bass|No, we're not.}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh, we ain't never gonna find that food truck.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Ooh.}}
{{L|Sandy and Larry|Shh...}}
{{L|Patrick|Food!}}
{{L|Squidward|Idiot!}}
{{L|Larry|Alright, campers! Let's put all our strengths together, and...}}
{{L|Sandy|...hunt that truck down like our primal ancestors.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Motor oil.}}
{{L|Sandy|Ha, got you cornered!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're not going anywhere.}}
{{L|Patrick|You are mine. Huh? Ooh.}}

{{L|Larry|Stand back! We're gonna use the buns of life! Who's hungry?}}
{{L|Squidward|I thought I was.}}
