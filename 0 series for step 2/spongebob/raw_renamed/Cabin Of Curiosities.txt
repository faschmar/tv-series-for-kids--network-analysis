{{L|SpongeBob|Ready Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm ready, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick are standing on a tree, then they start swinging from a vine making a Tarzan-like yell. They both crash into each other and climb up the tree to do it again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you ready?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm ready!}}
{{L|Squidward|What's all this yelling?!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick crash into Squidward]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Ouch...}}
{{L|''[Squidward becomes a broken jigsaw puzzle]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Oh.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's do the corners first. This piece then that piece.}}
{{L|Squidward|What in the name of Neptune are you two doing?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Trying for our danger badge.}}
{{L|Squidward|It says ranger badge, not danger badge.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, Mr. Tentacles, do you have a ranger badge?}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, I tried for it once. Never go for a ranger badge... Why don't you just try for something easy? A playing dead badge?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|No.}}
{{L|Squidward|A going home badge?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|No...}}
{{L|Squidward|Um, um... Ah, here, the making friends badge. All you need is four signatures.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Will you be my friend? Will you be my friend?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know if that counts, Patrick. We're already friends.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, this friendship is interfering with my badge getting.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, there are a lot of potential friends in camp.}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay. But if you get in my way again, I will destroy you!}}
{{L|Lady Upturn|Deliveries are in the back.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good to know. Patrick and I are working on our friendship badges. Would you like to be our friends?}}
{{L|Lady Upturn|How much is it going to cost me?}}
{{L|Rea|I'll give you a thousand dollars.}}
{{L|Roh|Two thousand.}}
{{L|Patrick|Do I hear three?}}
{{L|Lady Upturn|Three thousand dollars and all my jewlry, that I'm wearing today.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Please everybody stop! Our friendship is free.}}
{{L|Rea|I think I'm going to be sick.}}
{{L|Lady Upturn|Please, just leave before we catch what you beggars are infested with.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Eh, okay.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Cannonball! I'll be your friend.}}
{{L|Lady Upturn|No.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, Larry. Hi jocks! Patrick and I are working on our friendship badge. Would you like to be our friends?}}
{{L|Larry|No problemo. As soon as you two cream puffs do one chin up.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No problemo.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, no problem-eno. ''[they both struggle]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Nine hours later...}}
{{L|Larry|The gym's closed, bros. Better luck next time!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gee whiz, nobody wants to be our friends. ''[they both scream as lightning comes from the grass]'' That's the trawler cabin. They also call it the weirdo cabin.}}
{{L|Patrick|That's got a nice ring to it.}}
{{L|Little Roxy|You are either very brave.}}
{{L|Big Roxy|Or very foolish to venture into this dark domain.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Foolish! We're very foolish!}}
{{L|Big Roxy|So are we.}}
{{L|Big Roxy and Little Roxy|We are Roxy.}}
{{L|Little Roxy|Say hello to my cabin-mate, Jimmy.}}
{{L|Jimmy|Shake.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ye-yes, we are.}}
{{L|Jimmy|Don't worry. It tastes like maple syrup.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, thanks.}}
{{L|Preda|Hello. My name is Preda Tory. That is my web. I spun it this morning.}}
{{L|Patrick|Nice work. You do free alterations?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So, uh, whi... Which one of you is the ca-cabin counselor?}}
{{L|Preda|Hey, kid! Kidferatu.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, look at that. It's past our dead time... I mean bedtime.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Huh? Ooh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, how'd you get those badges?!}}
{{L|Big Roxy|By doing...}}
{{L|Little Roxy|Night camp activities!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We want night badges!}}
{{L|Preda|You're in luck! We can help you.}}
{{L|Jimmy|The first badge, is for swamp ape fishing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait, there's a swamp ape in this lake? ''[screaming]'' The lake we all swim in?!}}
{{L|Preda|Yeah, there are many horrible things in this lake besides campers.}}
{{L|Patrick|Ooh, I got one! It's a big one!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick!}}
{{L|Swamp ape|Hmm?}}
{{L|Little Roxy|Congratulations! You just earned your swamp ape fishing badge.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I get it! Swamp, ape, fishing! He fishes us! Night badge! Night badge! Night badge!}}
{{L|Jimmy|The next challenge is for nocturnal jelly milking. Here you go. Just fill this jar with jelly jam and the badge is yours.}}
{{L|Patrick|I caught one!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh boy! Oh, this ought to be easy-peasy. Who's a cute little jelly? You are.}}
{{L|Jimmy|Ahem. That one's too puny to fill the jar. Why don't you try this one?}}
{{L|Big Roxy|So which do you think is more effective, horror or terror?}}
{{L|Jimmy|I like revulsion.}}
{{L|Preda|I've always been partial to dread. Well, look who's back. Or should I say "look who's blech?"}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Yay!}}
{{L|Jimmy|Okay, this is your last task for the night.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, don't tell me. Some horrible monster is gonna catch us or eat us?}}
{{L|Jimmy|Oh, great idea. But I thought we'd play Sardine.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sardines? Oh, you mean that game where one person is it and hides. Then when somebody finds them, that person has to hide with the person that just got found. And then everyone that's looking for that person has to hide with that person when they find the person and then the last person finds them all? Oh, we got this.}}
{{L|Jimmy|Okay, Kidferatu will hide and we'll seek.}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh-huh. Hey!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aha!}}
{{L|Kidferatu|Shh!}}
{{L|Preda|Found you.}}
{{L|Big Roxy|Found you.}}
{{L|Jimmy|Pardon me. Excuse me. Tight fit.}}
{{L|Big Roxy|And as the loser, you're the winner! Here's your badge.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh! Um... They're gone.}}
{{L|Patrick|Without a kiss goodbye.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sandy!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Tentacles!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come quick! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!}}
{{L|Squidward|What? What? What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh! We wanna show you our night badges!}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh!}}
{{L|Squidward|Night badges? There's no such thing.}}
{{L|Sandy|You two jokers had me going there for a minute.}}
{{L|Squidward|Just where were you two all night?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|With the kids from the trawler cabin. You know, the one the other campers called the weirdo cabin?}}
{{L|Sandy|I hate to break it to you, SpongeBob, but that's what the other campers call our cabin.}}
{{L|Squidward|I wonder why.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm gonna find out what happened to our night badges.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um, hello? Where is everybody? Look, Patrick, four signatures! The Roxys, Jimmy, Preda, and Kidferatu. We got our friendship badge! Weirdos, weirdos, wei... Whoa.}}
{{L|Swamp ape|Ooh.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Will you be our friend?!}}
