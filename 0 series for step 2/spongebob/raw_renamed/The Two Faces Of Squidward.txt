{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|♪Squidward had a Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty. Squidward had a Krabby Patty whose buns were white as snow!♪}}
{{L|Squidward|''[talks while they sing the whole song again]'' Welcome to the Krusty Krab. Where it's almost as if the evolutionary clock ticks backwards. ''[cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|♪Squidward had a Krabby Patty--♪}}
{{L|Squidward|''[SpongeBob & Patrick are still singing in the kitchen]'' Excuse me for just a second.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|♪--white as snow!♪}}
{{L|Squidward|Do you mind, I'm trying to work in a fast food restaurant. You might wanna try it sometime!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I sure would, Squidward. That sounds... ''[Patrick interferes]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, wait a minute! SpongeBob, you already do work in a fast food restaurant! }}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, yeah!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Yay!}}
{{L|Squidward|Remind me to fire my therapist. ''[cuts to the front of Squidward's boat]'' And stop bringing your neighbors to work!}}
{{L|Patrick|We're not just neighbors.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You can say that again!}}
{{L|Patrick|We're not just... ''[Squidward interferes]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I don't care! ''[faces the customers, embarrassed. Laughs nervously]'' $4.19, please.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Squidward is shown like a thermometer, reaching the boiling point]'' Alright! I am gonna... Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do, but... ''[SpongeBob opens the door and bashes Squidward's face]''}}

{{L|Squidward| ''[screams as SpongeBob looks into Squidward]'' SpongeBob, you nincompoop! You broke my face! Don't just stand there, help me! I need a doctor!}}
{{L|''[Sounds of operation, SpongeBob eats Krusty Krab hats, Purple Doctorfish opens the door]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' Oh, doctor! Is he gonna be alright? For the love of Neptune, tell me!}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|Well ,son...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No! don't tell me! I can't take it! ''[SpongeBob is crying]''}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|We should know...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, please. Just... just don't.}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|We won't know for two weeks. You'll just have to wait. ''[Purple Doctorfish leaves]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Two weeks? I'll never make it. ''[SpongeBob falls down. Two weeks later, SpongeBob comes into the hospital with a bouquet of flowers]''}}
{{L|Nurse Rechid|Mornin', SpongeBob. You're early today.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good morning, Nurse Rechid. ''[walks over to an old lady]'' Hi, Mabel. Saved the blue one just for you. ''[takes out a blue flower and gives it to Mabel]''}}
{{L|Mabel|Oh, SpongeBob. Blue is my favorite color. Er... or is it orange?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Don't worry, Mabel. I'll bet your amnesia's gonna wear off in no time. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|Mabel|My what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[flops into Squidward's room]'' Hiya, Squidward! I've been practicing how to flop on my back.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[muffled shouting. His head is covered with bandages]''}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|We can't really have you in here today. I'm going to be removing Squidward's bandages and he made me swear to keep you far away from him.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It has been two weeks already? ''[SpongeBob Smiling]''. Don't worry, doc. I promise to stay out of the way.}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|Okay. As long as you stay on the other side of the...''[SpongeBob immediately dashes to the bed]'' ''[sighs]'' Right. ''[takes out some scissors and is about to remove the bandages on Squidward's face]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't rush it! Sorry, go ahead. Wait!}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|''[angrily]'' What is it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you sure that the patient has enough emensmansera?}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|I have no idea what that is. Please. Just let me work.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Very well, doctor. Carry on.}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|May I?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hold it! The readings on this brain meter are all wrong! We must postpone the operation!}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|That is a television set put here for the patient's enjoyment. And it's not even plugged into the wall!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're right, doctor. Proceed with operation sever. Hold it!}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|Now what?!}}
{{L|''[On the television]''}}
{{L|Nurse|Doctor, we can't do this. Surely we can use a less dangerous procedure. After all, we have to start thinking about... the welfare of... ''[Purple Doctorfish turns off the TV]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait!}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|''[impatiently]'' WHAT could it possibly be this TIME?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I just want to say sorry for interrupting you before.}}
{{L|''[Purple Doctorfish twitches his eye for a second. He unwraps the bandages. When all the bandages are off, there is a bright light that shines in his face.]''}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|''[gasps]'' I...I...I can't believe it. ''[Purple Doctorfish faints]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah?}}
{{L|Squidward|How does it look?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks at Squidward's face and is likewise stunned]'' Great Neptune...}}
{{L|Squidward|Come on. Spit it out. I can take it.}}
{{L|Nurse|Time for your medicine, Mister ''[sees Squidward's new look]''...Mister...Mister... ''[flirting gesture]'' Handsome! Ohhh... ''[The nurse melts]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What did she call me?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Handsome. But she spelled it wrong.}}
{{L|Squidward|Quick, hand me that mirror! ''[SpongeBob hands him a mirror, and he notices his new handsome look]'' What the...? Wait a second. That nurse was right. I ''am'' handsome!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, you're not handsome. You're a hunk!}}
{{L|''[Scene cuts to the Bikini Bottom city. People start to notice Squidward's new look]''}}

{{L|''[they are about to cross the street until a limousine enters their way, with the driver opening the door for them]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Squidward|A limousine?! ''[shocked then the crowd cheers]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Well SpongeBob, earlier today my spine was hurting, now I'm resting on fine leather upholstery. ''[Limo stops at Squidward's house while the crowd cheers for them]''}}

{{L|Fish #4|I want his eyelids! ''[crowd rips his shirt, causing Squidwar to run back inside home]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I guessed I kept them waiting a little too long. I know, a little music should soothe their hunger. ''[plays the clarinet]''}}

{{L|Squidward|''[smells the liquid soap]'' There's nothing a little foaming herbal bath can't cure. ''[a female fish takes his soap]'' Hey, my grandmother gave me that soap! Well, no one ever said it'd be easy being so handsome, Squiddy. You'll just start getting used to.. ''[screams as a big female fish with 4 eyes pops out of his bath tub]''}}
{{L|Big Female Fish|Hi, Handsome.}}
{{L|Male Fish #7|Handsome!}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Hmmm... I know just what to do. ''[crowd chases Squidward and SpongeBob until they reach the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Squidward? What have you done? You know what the Krusty Krab means to me, don't ya? And you took it upon yourself to bring all these, these customers, to me. Hey, don't worry folks, There's plenty of Squidward to go around. So everybody just line up and get your pocketbooks out, first will be a small fee of $14.98 per person, everyone will get the opportunity to touch Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|We don't have much time! Take the door and change me back.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And I'll even throw in a free soft drink for an extra $3.}}
{{L|Squidward|Come on, SpongeBob. Take the door and smash my face back!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't! It was one thing doing it by accident, but I can't hurt you on purpose.}}
{{L|Squidward|You better hurt me or I'm really gonna hurt you!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, okay...}}
