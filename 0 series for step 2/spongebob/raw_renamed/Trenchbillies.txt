{{L|''[Jellyfish run away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, it's moving!}}
{{L|Patrick|Ready to go for it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Like Mr. Krabs says, it's now or never!}}
{{L|Patrick|When does he say that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Usually on his way to the Men's room. Bunsai!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, that's usually what I say!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick begin chasing the jellyfish]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, he's taking evasive action.}}
{{L|Patrick|We better fake him.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll fake left, you go right!}}
{{L|Patrick|Roger that! ''[runs left]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Other right, Patrick!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[in slow motion]'' ''[jumping to catch the jellyfish]'' ''[the two collide in mid-air]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ow, I think I ruptured a spleen...}}
{{L|Patrick|I think I shattered my abacus.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Your what?}}
{{L|Patrick|My abacus. ''[Takes out his abacus]'' Nope. Seems okay...}}
{{L|''[The jellyfish fly by]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick! There it goes! ''[The two begin chasing it again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't stop now, Patrick, we're gaining on him! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh and they fall off a cliff]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[screams]''}}
{{L|''[Cuts to a small village inside a trench]''}}
{{L|Cletus|''[heading into outhouse]'' Well, it's now or never. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick fall onto the outhouse as Cletus walks into it]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ehhh.}}
{{L|Trenchbilly|You boys are mighty colorful, a smidget too colorful, if ya' ask me.}}
{{L|Cletus|''[climbs out of hole]'' And too darn heavy, if ya' ask me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, actually Patrick has been trying to shed a few-''[The trenchbillies capture them with a rope and they scream]''}}
{{L|Cletus|Tell it to Ma Angler...''[The trenchbillies carry them on a pole to Ma Angler's house]''}}
{{L|Trenchbillies|''[all talking]'' ''[cuts to Ma Angler's house]''}}
{{L|Ma Angler|Now tell me there, what was it y'alls was doin' down yonder at the outhouse in the first place?}}
{{L|Cletus|I dun told ya', Ma, thar I was doin' my duty, just like any other Sunday...''[flashback]''}}
{{L|Cletus|''[heading into outhouse]'' Well, it's now or never... ''[flashback stops]'' When not so much as a warning shout, these here varmints dun dropped, right out of the wild, black yonder, smack-dab onto my noggin! Darn there givin' me a crick in the neck it has to.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're really sorry about interrupting your-}}
{{L|Jordan Klein|Y'all hush up!}}
{{L|Ma Angler|Now Cletus, is this another one of your tall tales, you tend to tell?}}
{{L|Cletus|I-I-I swears I ain't fibbin', Ma!}}
{{L|Ma Angler|Cletus.}}
{{L|Cletus|Just ask Uncle Belcher. He'll tell you the whole story.}}
{{L|Uncle Belcher|''[belches]''}}
{{L|Cletus|See.}}
{{L|Ma Angler|Well, I must admit one thing, they is awfully perty... Nevertheless, as leader of this here clan, which I is, I must subject these two pretty folks, to clan initiation rights to deem their worthy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Umm...}}
{{L|Patrick|Worthy of what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|...specifically.}}
{{L|Ma Angler|Of livin'... ''[SpongeBob and Patrick gulp]'' Theether! Go on and get your fiddle.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Look, Patrick! He's gonna play us a little song. ''[Teether plays a short tune]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Short song.}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, I think this is meant to be a-a musical challenge.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Challenge? ''[The trenchbilly plays another short tune]'' Patrick, we don't even have an instrument to play. ''[He plays yet another song, a bit longer this time.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, and soon we won't have anything to play it with...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh! Patrick! Hang on... ''[SpongeBob whispers to a trenchbilly]'' ''[The trenchbilly takes off his suspenders and gives them to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, don't leave me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wouldn't dream of it, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Alright! ''[The trenchbilly continues to play his fiddle]'' ''[Patrick begins playing a tune, using SpongeBob's body. Patrick and the trenchbilly play back and forth very fast]'' ''[The trenchbilly eventually explodes and Patrick wins. Stars fall from the sky]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, Patrick, even though you won, it looks like he was the real star. Hahaha. ''[Patrick smiles]''}}
{{L|Ma Angler|Betsy!}}
{{L|Betsy|Yes'um?}}
{{L|Ma Angler|It's time for a hootin' and hollarin' contest.}}
{{L|Betsy|''[clears throat]'' ''[begins yodeling]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, it's a singing competition. What are we gonna do?}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know, but I am a sure thirsty after that fiddlin'. ''[drinks soda]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, give me some of that! ''[begins drinking the soda]'' ''[Both SpongeBob and Patrick let out a very long and loud belch.]''}}
{{L|Trenchbillies|Yee-haww!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Looks like we're on a roll, eh, Patrick?}}
{{L|''[Cuts to outside, where a wrestling match is taking place.]''}}
{{L|Ma Angler|I just love me some wrastlin' and tusslin'! ''[One of the wrestlers in thrown through Ma Angler's roof]'' ''[SpongeBob and Patrick clap and SpongeBob whistles]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Let me see more.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My compliments to the chef.}}
{{L|Cletus|''[pokes SpongeBob with a pitchfork]'' Your turn.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hah! Well, actually, my friend and I, we don't like to wrestle.}}
{{L|Ma Angler|Huh? You don't like to wrastle?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, we're not the wrestling sort.}}
{{L|Ma Angler|Well, then, what in tarnation do you pretty folks like to do for fun?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, uh-uh, we like to go jellyfishing!}}
{{L|Ma Angler|Jellyfishin'. What kinda tomfoolery is jellyfishin'?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, it goes something like this: ''[SpongeBob and Patrick pull out their nets and start running around and dancing]''}}
{{L|Cletus|What-the?}}
{{L|Ma Angler|That's disgustin'.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now, Patrick! ''[they both jump into the air and collide in slow motion once again]'' Well, something like that anyway...}}
{{L|Patrick|Nice knowing you, buddy...}}
{{L|Ma Angler|Well, I haven't seen anybody cut up like that 'round these parts since we was potty-trained Junior. ''[laughs]'' He was near about 13! ''[The trenchbillies all laugh]''}}
{{L|Cletus|Them boys is dumber than my box a' rotten teeth! ''[Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick walking through a crowd of trenchbillies, with confetti.]''}}
{{L|Cletus|Go get em' tiger!}}

{{L|Ma Angler|As leader of this here clan, I hereby debut: Sponge-Joe-Bob and Deral, honorary trenchbillies. ''[hands them novelty teeth]'' ''[SpongeBob and Patrick both put in the teeth]''}}
{{L|Cletus|Speech! Speech!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I guess if I were to say one thing, and I think I'm speaking for Patrick and myself here, is that y'all are a bunch a' real kind folks and it's been a real hoot gettin' to know y'all! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick walk away waving]'' Farewall, friendly trenchbillies. See ya' 'round.}}
{{L|Patrick|Toodles.}}
{{L|Cletus|''[stops them with a pitchfork]'' And where do you folk think you're goin'?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Over to home.}}
{{L|Cletus|Well, you're one of our kin' now, so this is your home, and as such, you've been givin' the great honor of takin' care a' Ma, for the rest of your natural-born lives.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Confused and worried]''Takin' care a' Ma?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Terrified]''For the rest of our natural-born lives?!}}
{{L|Cletus|You know, carry her purse, give her cat massages, read her the Willy Shakespeare â€˜til she falls asleep at night. Ah, Ma just loves Iambic pentameter!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Nervous]''Well, that all sounds like a lot of fun, but I-I have responsibilities back home at Bikini Bottom. I have a pet snail to feed and can't be late for work at the Krusty Krab!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, and, iambic pentameter gives me a headache! ''[starts crying]''}}
{{L|Cletus|''[swings pitchfork]'' You folks ain't goin' nowhere.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh please, Mr. Trenchbillie, where can we-}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, hey, your shoe's untied.}}
{{L|Cletus|What? But I ain't even wearin'-''[Sees SpongeBob and Patrick are suddenly gone]'' Darn it.}}
{{L|''[Cuts to Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, what was I supposed to tell them, Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|You could have told him that he could have his money back.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, no I couldn't.}}
{{L|Squidward|Why?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Because, I already put it in the register!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick burst through the door]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs! We just escaped from an angry mob of deep sea bunkins!}}
{{L|Patrick|It was horrible! They were gonna make us stay forever and massage their grandma.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Unconcerned]'' So. Why ya' telling me?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Because they followed us here. ''[The trenchbillies show up at the door Squidward and Mr. Krabs get scared]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs all scream]'' ''[The trenchbillies storm in and begin destroying the Krusty Krab's possessions]''}}
{{L|Cletus|Come on out! We know you're in thar!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[nervous]'' Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?}}
{{L|Cletus|Umm, sure. I'll have me a large Krabby Patty with uhh...a cola, no, no! Lemon-lime! ''[Shows the trenchbillies all eating.]'')}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Keep them coming, SpongeBob! This is the most business in a long time!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye', captain! I'm gonna get some more buns.}}
{{L|Ma Angler|More! More! More! More! ''[A trenchbilly shoves Krabby Patties into her mouth using a shovel]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh yeah, that's what I like to see. She's gonna make customer of the week.}}
{{L|Cletus|''[pokes Mr. Krabs with his pitchfork]'' We catch anyone makin' goo-goo eyes like that at our Ma, it can only mean one thing: He's gonna get hitched!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gulps]'' ''[shows Mr. Krabs and Ma Angler in a car riding away]'' Noooooo!}}
