{{L|''[The episode begins with SpongeBob getting himself ready to go to sleep. He stretches, yawns, and hops into bed. He puts on his nightcap, fluffs up his pillow, and lays down to sleep. But when he breathes, he notices something was wrong with his mouth. He smacks his lips and opens his mouth. Inside, his tongue is all dried up and a family of hillbilly germs move away because they're home has no water. SpongeBob realizes that he is thirsty, so he gets out of bed to get a drink of water. He walks downstairs and into the living room.]''}}

''[pours water in a glass and drinks it; but he spits it out after seeing the refrigerator open]'' I don't remember leaving the fridge open. Huh? ''[closes the fridge and sees the living room a complete mess]'' Huh, I don't remember making such a mess. ''[spaghetti falls on his face]'' And I'm pretty sure I didn't eat spaghetti. ''[opens his stomach, revealing a lite candle, a Krabby Patty, some fries, and a soda]'' Nope. ''[puts spaghetti in his stomach and closes it; then a big noise from upstairs]'' Huh?}}

{{L|''[SpongeBob grabs his alarm clock, turns up the volume, and sets it to the waking hour. SpongeBob's alarm clock bellows a loud noise in Patrick's face. The noise was so loud that it even woke Squidward and several people up. The car alarm goes off and several worms start barking. The alarm clock did not effect Patrick and he continues to sleep-walk.
