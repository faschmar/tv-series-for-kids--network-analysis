{{L|French Narrator|Ah, the eternal expanse of the deep sea. Teeming with fantastic creatures. Uh, teeming… I’m sure they’re around here somewhere. Aha! ''[zooms in on a rock with bugs on it]'' Oh, that’s a rock. Where is everybody? ''[screams]'' ''[SpongeBob is right there, and he scared the narrator]'' Oh, it is just SpongeBob. Watch and witness one of the rarest and mysterious rituals of the deep, the staring contest. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick are having a staring contest]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[his eyes get watery and he finally blinks]'' Patrick, wow!}}
{{L|Patrick|What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You are the best starer I’ve ever stared at!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, staring contest! I thought it was a blinking contest and I was losing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[There is a sound like something is falling]'' Hark, Patrick. Do you hear something? ''[A message in a bottle falls on SpongeBob’s head, and SpongeBob falls down]'' Oh! ''[reads the note tied to the bottle]'' Hmm, it’s a letter for Sandy, all the way from Texas. We better deliver it!}}
{{L|''[Scene cuts to Sandy’s treedome]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sandy! ''[tries to open Sandy’s door, but it doesn’t open]'' Oh, it’s not opening!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, SpongeBob! I have something that might help. ''[pulls out a book called '‘How to Open Things’']''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How to open things. Brilliant, Patrick! I saw the movie, but I never read the book.}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh, ok. ''[flips through the pages]'' Garbage cans. No. Jar. No. Box. No. Sandy’s door! Twist to the left.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! I was twisting to the right.}}
{{L|Patrick|A common mistake, my good friend. ''[puts away the book]'' Allow me. ''[does some warm up exercises]'' Okay, time to open this.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[kicks her door open]'' Hi-yah! Trying to ninja sneak attack? Hi-yah! Hi-yah! ''[kicks Patrick up in the air, and she hits SpongeBob, causing the note in the bottle on SpongeBob’s head to fall out]'' Well, you’re still no match for my squirrel-fu! ''[grabs the note and reads it]'' It’s a letter from my twin brother, Randy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Patrick falls on SpongeBob]'' Oh!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[SpongeBob and Patrick get into Sandy’s suit]'' Do you mind?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not at all. Read on.}}
{{L|Patrick|Doesn’t bother me.}}
{{L|Sandy|Get out of my suit!'' [SpongeBob and Patrick are flushed out of Sandy’s suit]'' Well, golly! Randy says the rodeo’s come to town. I’ve got to head back to Texas and defend my championship title!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Championship title? For what?}}
{{L|Sandy|You got cotton in your ears?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[looks in SpongeBob’s ear]'' Hmm, no. It’s not cotton. It’s actually an old moldy piece of Krabby Patty. ''[eats the Krabby Patty]'' Mmm.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[holds a jellyfish net]'' Is your championship title for jellyfishing?}}
{{L|Sandy|No.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Karate? ''[hits Patrick in the face]''}}
{{L|Sandy|No!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[he and Patrick are now wearing white coats and glasses, and Patrick is holding a mini volcano]'' Perhaps the science fair, then.}}
{{L|Sandy|No. It’s my rodeo championship on the line.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Rodeo? What does rodeo mean?}}
{{L|Sandy|♪Critters that you gotta wrangle.♪ ''[pulls out a lasso and lassos SpongeBob and Patrick]'' ♪Cowboy suits with purty spangles.♪ ''[now wearing spangles on her suit and she is wearing cowboy boots and a cowboy hat]'' ♪Boots with spurs that jingle jangle, that's a rodeo. Tight blue jeans you gotta squeeze in, but they sure look mighty pleasin'!♪ ''[gives Patrick a wedgie by putting some jeans on him.]'' ♪Big belt buckles are always in season!♪ ''[SpongeBob is wearing a big belt buckle]'' ♪That's a rodeo.♪}}

Tractor pulls and big old bulls.♪ ''[she, SpongeBob and Patrick are on a tractor and then a bull]'' ♪Line dancin’, horses prancin’!♪ ''[There is a bunch of squirrels line dancing, and then there is a horse in a tutu prancing]'' ♪Barrel racin’, bareback ridin’!♪ ''[she, SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting on a barrel and then a horse]'' ♪Bronco bustin’,  aluminium sidin’.♪ ''[The horse bucks SpongeBob and Patrick off and onto barn doors]'' ♪That’s a rodeo.♪}}

{{L|Sandy|♪And don’t forget who makes us laugh when we’re feelin’ down. The happy slappy, sunny, funny good ol’ rodeo clown.♪ ''[puts on a clown suit]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Clowns? ''[grabs onto Sandy]'' Don’t go, Sandy! It’s too risky!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[pushes SpongeBob away]'' I must! It’s my duty! ''[her suit turns into a rocket and Sandy rockets out of the water]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, this is terrible! We can’t let Sandy go all alone! It’s too dangerous up there, right Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Eh, I’m indifferent.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How could we live with ourselves if Sandy got hurt, and we weren’t there to help? Why, I wouldn’t be able to look at myself.}}
{{L|Patrick|Look at yourself? How do you do that? ''[spins around, trying to look at himself]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick! This is no time for silly games! Sandy needs us. You understand? Patrick? Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[runs away, thinking about the wedgie]'' No more tight jeans!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I’m sure someone else will help me.}}
{{L|''[Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs’ office in The Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So there you have it, Mr. Krabs. Sandy really needs our help.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Okay, explain it to me again, but this time, take out anything that doesn’t have to do with money. Uh-huh, that’s what I thought. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sighs]'' I need to find someone with compassion. Someone who selflessly helps others, with no concern for his own safety. I need…a hero.}}
{{L|''[Scene cuts to Squidward’s front yard, where Squidward it sunbathing]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Squidward! Sandy is in terrible trouble. You’ve got to help me save her!}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, no! Sally’s in trouble!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, Sandy.}}
{{L|Squidward|Don’t worry, SpongeBob. Just wait right here. ''[walks towards his house]'' I’ll get my emergency squirrel rescue kit!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Right-o, Mr. Tentacles, sir!}}
{{L|Squidward|Just don’t panic! ''[goes in his house and slams the door, then he climbs out the back window and walks away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, uh, well, there’s one last person I can ask.}}
{{L|''[Scene cuts to the Chum Bucket]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[bangs on the door]'' Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[opens the door and comes out]'' What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sandy’s in trouble. I need help rescuing her.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[gets some dynamite with a timer on it]'' I’m kind of busy right now.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Jeepers, it’ll only take a minute.}}
{{L|Plankton|Yeah, uh, I’d love to help, but I really got to go. ''[picks up the dynamite and carries it towards the Krusty Krab, and the dynamite blows up before Plankton gets to the Krusty Krab]'' Ouch.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ugh. Well, I’m going to go save Sandy, whether anyone wants to help or not.}}
{{L|''[Scene cuts to SpongeBob’s room]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[packs his suitcase]'' I guess it’s just you and me, Gary. ''[tries to pack Gary, but he doesn’t let go of the floor]'' Let’s go. Gary the snail! Do you plan on staying here while Sandy is possibly in trouble somewhere up there?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow meow meow?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|She’s the squirrel.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, brown. Gary, what does that have to do ''[Gary leaves]'' You too, huh? Well, we’ll see about that! ''[pulls out some bubble soap. Scene changes to nighttime]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[opens his bubble soap and blows a bubble to capture Gary. Scene cuts to Squidward’s front yard]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[blows a bubble that goes in Squidward’s window, and captures Squidward, then SpongeBob blows a bubble that goes in Patrick’s house and capture’s Patrick]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Eh, pudding.}}
{{L|''[Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs house, where a bubble is blown to capture Mr. Krabs. Scene cuts to Bikini Bottom, where a lot of Bikini Bottomites are captured by bubbles. Scene cuts to SpongeBob’s house, where everyone that was captured by bubbles is]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|''[blows a bubble capturing his alarm clock which goes off, popping all the bubbles]''}}
{{L|Everyone inside a bubble|''[screaming]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good morning!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! What’s the meaning of this?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sandy’s in trouble, and I need all of your help to save her from the horrors of the rodeo! There are clowns there!}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, the next time you ‘invite’ me to one of your slumber parties, I’m calling the cops! ''[walks outside, and he falls because SpongeBob’s house is also in a bubble]'' ''[screams]'' Arrgh, Arrgh, oh, oh. What the? SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[falls beside Squidward]'' Oh. Yes, Squidward?}}
{{L|Everyone who was trapped in a bubble, except Squidward|''[walk outside, and they fall as well and scream as the bubble comes out of the water and goes to Texas]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Where the devil are we?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's... Texas.}}
{{L|Everyone in the Bubble|''[screaming]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What’s that, boy? You see Sandy?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And she’s…riding a bullfrog?}}
{{L|Sandy|''[riding a bullfrog]'' Yee-haw!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ahoy, Sandy!}}
{{L|Sandy|Huh?}}
{{L|Frog|Ribbit! ''[bucks Sandy off]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Ow! Gall darn it! You sea slickers made me lose the rodeo. Why are you here, anyways?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|To help save you from this rodeo thing!}}
{{L|Sandy|I don’t need to be saved! ''[gasps]'' Watch out! That old bullfrog’s got a flea on his flanks, and he’s comin’ right at ya!}}
{{L|Bullfrog|Ribbit, ribbit!}}
{{L|Everyone in the bubble| ''[screaming as they were attacked by the bullfrog, when the bubble pops everyone looks like real sea creatures when they land]''}}
{{L|Bullfrog|Ribbit.}}
{{L|Patrick|Did we save Sandy?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick. We didn’t.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Did we make any money?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|Sandy|Aw, cactus! That ol’ bullfrog’s got SpongeBob! Hang on, old buddy! ''[lassos SpongeBob away from the bullfrog as the crowd cheers]'' Next time, leave the rodeos to me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aw, nuts. ''[iris out.]}}
