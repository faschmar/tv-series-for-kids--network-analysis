{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[Episode starts at the night view of the Bikini Bottom with a scallop on the sign, then there's a view of Squidward's house, with a light now turned on. Squidward picks up a remote and sits on his couch]''}}
{{L|Squidward|All of the most intelligent programming starts before 5 AM. ''[clicks the remote]''}}
{{L|Announcer|Our programming will begin shortly.}}
{{L|Squidward|No, no, no. Take your time. It's worth the wait.}}
{{L|Announcer|Bikini Bottom Public Access presents: ''[Squidward claps his hands]'' "Fab and Fancy," your source for the latest in exotic pets, collectible jewel-encrusted mittens, ''[doorbell rings]'' and classical doorbell chimes...}}
{{L|Squidward|How sophisticated! ''[drinks empty cup of coffee]''}}
{{L|Announcer|...has been canceled! ''[buzzer sounds]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[spits out steam]'' Oh, yeah, I haven't made the coffee yet. ''[cuts to coffee maker as he makes the coffee]'' Why in the world would they cancel "Fab and Fancy?" What could possibly be more enriching? ''[as he drinks his coffee, guitar music starts playing, the house starts shaking and Squidward spits out coffee]'' What?! ''[a man continues to play the guitar on TV. He's then lit on fire, and then explodes and a title card comes up saying "The Guitar Lord".]''}}
{{L|Zeus|Hey. I'm Zeus the Guitar Lord. I don't have a guitar yet. But if I did, I would want a really killer one like this! ''[pulls out a paper, showing a red guitar]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[scoffs, in an angered tone]'' He obviously doesn't know the first thing about music! This is an outrage!}}
{{L|Zeus|''[shows his phone number: "1-32G-LORD"]'' So, here's my number if you want to talk about... ''[phone rings]'' Hello?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[angrily]'' Where is my "Fab and Fancy?!"}}
{{L|Zeus|Your... what?}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm quite certain you wouldn't know culture if it bit you on the guitar!}}
{{L|Zeus|Uh... hummm... I don't have a guitar.}}
{{L|Squidward|Do they just give a show to just anybody over there?}}
{{L|Zeus|Pretty much. My mom gave me this one for my birthday.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[surprised]'' Really?}}
{{L|Zeus|Yeah. I wanted a guitar or a star named after me... but you know, whatever. I guess a TV show is cool.}}
{{L|Squidward|It's that easy? ''[hangs up the phone and dials a number]'' Hello? Bikini Bottom Public Access? ''[excitedly]'' Give me a TV show! Give me a TV show! I want a show! ''[cut to the Krusty Krab later]'' Come on! Just a few more minutes, Squiddie, and it will be your turn to bask in the lime light! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ohhh, yeah! Oh, lime light basking! Baskin' in the lime light! ''[laughs]'' Oh, good times. Good times. ''[turns to Squidward]'' So, where will said basking take place?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[angrily]'' Like, I would tell you! Hmph... ''[thinking]'' Although, I've waited my whole life to have enough glory to rub it in someone's face. Anyone's face. ''[turns to SpongeBob who winks. He shivers.]'' Even that face. Okay! I'll tell you, but the last thing I would want is for you to show up so plug your ears! ''[shoves Krabby Patties in SpongeBob's ears]'' Well, I don't want to toot my own whistle, but... Wait, no! That's exactly what I mean to do! ''[SpongeBob hears Squidward mumbling and laughing. Clock ticks to 5:00PM and a bell rings]'' Oh! ''[rushes off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Say again, Squidward? ''[Squidward laughs as he runs home]''}}
{{L|Announcer|Bikini Bottom Public Access presents: "Squidward Chat!" With your host: Squidward Tentacles.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[in his home]'' Greetings. I'm Squidward Tentacles, your host of "Squidward Chat". ''[Gary is seen watching TV at his house. He pushes a button on the remote.]'' ''[off-Screen]'' Today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing something near and dear to my heart, under-appreciated artists like myself. ''[SpongeBob sees Squidward on TV]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward's on TV? ''[screams and rushes to Squidward's house]'' Squidward! Squidward! ''[pants and then rushes into the house, but goes back out, knocks and then goes inside. He pants as he approaches Squidward]'' Squidward, you're on TV! ''[Squidward frowns]'' No, really, Squidward, come look!}}
{{L|Squidward|I know I'm on TV! See the camera? ''[They both look at a camera]'' You're on TV too! ''[SpongeBob stares at the camera]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|TV? ''[leaves happily]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Moron. As I was saying, today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing...}}
{{L|Patrick|Wow! ''[SpongeBob enters with Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So I ran to tell Squidward that he was on TV and he told me that I was on TV and now you're on TV!}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm on TV?! ''[rushes back to his house and turns on the TV]''}}
{{L|Squidward|This isn't happening!}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm not on TV! ''[rushes back into Squidward's house]'' SpongeBob! I went home and turned on my TV, but... I wasn't on the TV. Why did you lie to me, SpongeBob? Why?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[annoyingly]'' Patrick, just how dumb are you?}}
{{L|Patrick|It varies.}}
{{L|Squidward|If you want to be on TV, you have to be in front of the camera!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh. I get it! ''[rushes to camera, giggling]'' Hi, TV people! ''[puts his face on the lens, then shows his mouth]'' And my mouth is on TV! ''[a live action shot of the inside of a person's mouth is shown on a television set]''}}
{{L|Grandma|This is disgusting!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[licks and bites the lens]'' SpongeBob, you gotta try this! ''[they both play with the camera and laugh]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Patrick, SpongeBob, get off my camera! ''[gets Patrick off the camera, but Patrick falls onto Squidward. Squidward growls and pushes Patrick off of him]'' Would you get out of here?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[scratching his head]'' Doubt it. ''[Squidward slaps his head and sighs]''}}
{{L|Squidward|If you like the camera so much, why don't you be the camera man?}}
{{L|Patrick|Camera man?}}
{{L|Squidward|That means you take all the pretty pictures. ''[makes air quotes]''}}
{{L|Patrick|All right!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, ooh! Whoo! Whoo! Let me do something too, please?!}}
{{L|Squidward|Fine. You can be the soundman. ''[hands SpongeBob a boom microphone]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[amazed as an angelic choir sings]'' Soundman...}}
{{L|Squidward|Imbeciles! ''[clears throat]'' Today, we're going to be talking about... ''[the camera is aimed at a still painting of Squidward]'' Why isn't the camera on me?'' [Patrick moves it to another painting]'' No! I'm the one talking! ''[Patrick moves the camera around, Squidward growls and jumps in front of the camera]'' I'm right here! Ahem! Today on Squidward Chat... we'll be discussing the under-appreciated arts. ''[sits down]'' Patrick, I'm down here! ''[Patrick lowers camera]'' As I was saying, today, we'll be... ''[Patrick moves the camera up and down once]'' Today... ''[Patrick moves the camera up and down repeatedly and Squidward growls]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[as he moves the camera up and down]'' Upsy-daisy! Downsy-wounsy! Upsy-daisy! Downsy-wounsy! ''[Squidward growls, gets up, walks up to Patrick, and ties him to the camera]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sits back down]'' Now then, I was going to tell you about my fabulous... ''[SpongeBob lowers boom microphone into the scene, hits it on Squidward's head and puts it in his mouth]'' Sponge...! ''[the microphone hits Squidward in the face and he growls]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's heavy! ''[Squidward grabs it and places it in SpongeBob]'' Thanks! But it itches. ''[Cut to Mr. Krabs seeing Squidward on TV]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[off-screen]'' I gotta go potty!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Squidward has his own TV show?}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, you'll just have to hold it, Patrick! Now, if there are no more interruptions... ''[Mr. Krabs holds a sign that says "Eat at the Krusty Krab" in front of the camera]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Eat at the Krusty Krab, home of the original Krabby Patty! ''[Squidward gets up]'' And remember, we change our grease monthly!}}
{{L|Squidward|Out! ''[pushes Mr. Krabs out and comes back, groans and sighs in relief]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[comes back in, dances with sign and sings]'' Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! We don't want just you! We want your money too! ''[cut to Sandy seeing the show]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Whee, doggy! I can line-dance better than that! ''[goes in front of the camera and dances]'' Yee-haw!}}
{{L|Pearl|Daddy! I'm borrowing your wallet! ''[sees Mr. Krabs and Sandy dancing on TV]'' Line dancing? Eww! That is so lame. What they need is my way cool cheer routine. ''[falls onto Squidward's desk, breaking it in half]'' Give me a K! ''[cuts to Plankton at the Chum Bucket watching the show]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, please. I can cause far more collateral damage than that! ''[walks off]'' Karen, where'd you put my death ray?}}
{{L|Pearl|Go, team, go! Go, team, go! Go, team, go! ''[Plankton appears on camera, laughs evilly and starts firing lasers around the house, breaking two paintings in the process]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[laughs as he rocks the camera up and down]'' My shorts are wet! ''[lasers fly by him]''}}
{{L|Pearl|''[as camera pans at Sandy, then at Pearl, and then at Mr. Krabs]'' Fight, team, fight! Fight, team, fight! Fight, team, fight! ''[Plankton then fires at Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Plankton|And eat at the Chum Bucket or perish! ''[laughs evilly, but Mr. Krabs kicks him away]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|The Krusty Krab! The Krusty Krab! Eat at the Krusty Krab!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sadly]'' No! My show! ''[sniffles and sobs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[rises from behind the desk along with his arms and then rubs Squidward's back]'' You seem tense. ''[Squidward growls]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[groans and pushes SpongeBob away]'' Cut that out! ''[gets angry and veins throb in his forehead]'' That's it! Everyone, out! ''[everybody stops what they're doing]'' What do you think this is, huh? Some kind of housewarming?!}}
{{L|Larry|''[as Squidward frowns]'' Did somebody say housewarming? Hey, everyone! It's a housewarming! ''[citizens come into Squidward's house cheering as the house's cheeks start puffing up. Squidward notices everyone talking as a limousine pulls up and a man comes out]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Get off my set! This is not working! ''[the man comes in]''}}
{{L|Man|Actually, I'd say the show is doing just fine. ''[approaches Squidward]'' At least according to our latest ratings. ''[pulls out a bag of money, big at first, but then zooms out to show that the bag is tiny. He then laughs, coughs and clears his throat]'' This is actually a lot by public access standards. Everyone is working out except for you... ''[points to a lady]'' ...you... ''[points to a boy]'' ...you... ''[points to a man]'' ...and you! ''[points to Squidward]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Me? ''[now kicked out of his house. Cuts to Squidward in the bed frowning with a remote in his hand]''}}
{{L|Announcer|And now, Bikini Bottom's top public access show for the last 20 weeks: ''[as horn toots]'' "Squidward's House Party!" With your host, Zeus the Guitar Lord.}}
{{L|Zeus|Hey, hey, hey, Bikini Bottom. Are you ready to party Squidward style? ''[crowd cheers, applauds. Cuts to Squidward in his bed frowning]'' Thank you for making us number one because I was finally able to get... ''[shows his guitar on camera]'' ...a new guitar! Thanks, Squidward! ''[Squidward growls]'' Let's party! ''[As a curtain reveals Zeus, he begins to play guitar as audience cheers and applauds. The scene zooms out to show Sandy line-dancing, SpongeBob playing the keyboard, Patrick playing the drums and Pearl doing her cheer. Mr. Krabs swings on a rope holding the sign that says "Eat at the Krusty Krab" as Plankton is pressing buttons, which fire lasers. Cuts to TV, then to Squidward, who is shocked]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[as he stomps on the floor while holding a broom]'' Keep it down! I'm trying to sleep! ''[screams as the camera pans down on Zeus, rocks start falling from the ceiling. People continue to party around Squidward's house. Fades to black, ending the episode.]''}}
