{{L|''[The episode begins with Sandy rounding up capturing some bacteria in her amoeba form.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[laughs]'' Yee-haw! Get along, little amoebas! ''[checks her watch]'' I did it! It's sarsaparilla time! ''[jumps out from her microscope, pushes the exit button and reverts back to her normal form]'' Holy osmosis! I lived as an amoeba for a whole week!}}
{{L|''[Sandy jumps off her table, takes a vial and pours it on a speck, which forms into a telephone. Sandy dials the number and calls Karen at the Chum Bucket.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[crushing a remote]'' Can't get it to work, can never get it to work! ''[yells indistinctly in the background]''}}
{{L|Karen|''[answers the phone]'' Hello?}}
{{L|Sandy|''[pushes the screen to make room]'' Karen, my Mainframe! I just made a scientific breakthrough. Let's go and celebrate, girl!}}
{{L|Karen|I'm sorry, Sandy. I can't hear you because ''[turns to Plankton]'' someone can't shut up!}}
{{L|''[Plankton stops yelling.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|That's okay, Karen. I'll tell you all about it later. Let's meet up tonight at the corner café!}}
{{L|Karen|You got it, Bushy Tushy. I will definitely be there. ''[Sandy hangs up the phone]'' Okay, I'm off.}}
{{L|Plankton|Those are not my test tubes! ''[kicks some test tubes]''}}
{{L|Karen|Ugh. Don't wait up.}}
{{L|Plankton|I don't know where they came from! ''[throws some more test tubes]''}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to SpongeBob, who is once again trying to pass his boating exam with Mrs. Puff at her boating school.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[mutters excitedly]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[sighs]'' Don't forget to signal.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gets up and waves his arms]'' Oh, thanks for that, Mrs. Puff, I—''[crashes into the wall and Mrs. Puff puffs up]''}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff deflates and her cellphone rings.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[answers her cellphone]'' Hello?}}
{{L|Sandy|''[pushes the screen to make room]'' Howdy, Powder Puff! You wanna step out with me and Karen tonight?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh, yes, Sandy! I desperately need to step out. ''[laughs and exits her boat]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh! You're talking to Sandy? Mrs. Puff, tell her I said, "Hi!" Tell her I said, "Hi!" Tell her I said, "Hi!"}}
{{L|Sandy|We'll all meet up at the corner café tonight. Get ready to party, y'all!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Okay! See you soon!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Tell her I said, "Hi!"}}
{{L|Sandy|''[hangs up the phone and pulls the screen back up]'' Whoo.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Tell her I said, "Hi!"}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff exits the boating school and locks the gate. She hums as she walks until SpongeBob shows up.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mrs. Puff! Tell her I said, "Hi!"}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff frantically runs away from SpongeBob. The scene changes to Sandy, Karen and Mrs. Puff drinking hot chocolate at the corner café at night.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[gives Mrs. Puff and Karen a toast of their friendship]'' Yeah!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff and Karen get whipped cream on their faces and sigh. Sandy gets whipped cream on her face as well. But she sneezes it onto her helmet.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[licks the whipped cream]'' Y'all are never gonna believe what I did this week. It's about as crazy as a mule with a top hat!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Was it crazier than this? ''[imitating SpongeBob]'' "Tell her I said 'Hi!'" "Tell her I said 'Hi!'" ''[mimics SpongeBob's laugh and falls over]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Sorry you day was tough, Puff. But my news will cheer your head off. I lived as a microscopic organism for a whole week!}}
{{L|Karen|That's great, Sandy, but I've lived ''with'' a microscopic organism for 26 years and wait until you hear what that pipsqueak did today. He leaves his little telescope on the floor, ''[smacks Mrs. Puff by accident as she talks]'' I rolled over it. It hurt like heck! And then, he gets mad at me for breaking it. Doesn't even ask if my wheel's okay. ''[picks up her wheels to show that one of them is broken]}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[gets up]'' SpongeBob is the same way, Karen. After all these years of my trying to teach him how to drive, he doesn't know the first thing about a car! ''[pounds on the table]'' I'm going crazy!}}
{{L|''[Both Karen and Mrs. Puff cry their tears off. Karen’s screen visualizes a scenic waterfall, with her tears running down in real time from where the waterfall is on screen]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Hey, hey, hey, hey. We're supposed to be having a good 'ol time, not a good 'ol cry.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[sniffs and stops crying, with her mascara running down her face]'' I'm having a good time.}}
{{L|Karen|''[stops crying, Karen’s screen visualizes an industrial valve being turned off]'' Me too.}}
{{L|Sandy|Look, guys. This is a girls night out. And I'm gonna make sure we have more fun than three rats in a pickle barrel! ''[Karen and Mrs. Puff join hands with Sandy]'' Gal pals unite!}}
{{L|Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen|Yeah!}}
{{L|Karen|''[her screen shows "Gal Pals" on it]'' Gal pals!}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen are hiding in the dumpster.]''}}
{{L|Karen|So, let me get this straight. Pranking Plankton will make me feel better?}}
{{L|Sandy|You bet your sweet software it will. Now let's get pranking.}}
{{L|''[Sandy and Mrs. Puff dress up in a poorly made costume of Mr. Krabs. They come out of the dumpster, but the costume is making them lose their balance. Karen places the costume's head on them, takes out her microphone and imitates herself as Mr. Krabs.]''}}
{{L|Karen|''[imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone]'' Money, money, money, money, money, money, money.}}
{{L|''[Sandy and Mrs. Puff step up to the front door.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Ready? ''[throws a rock]'' Yah!}}
{{L|''[The rock smashes through the window and hits Plankton.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Ouch! ''[peaks out the window and sees Mrs. Puff and Sandy in their disguise]'' Krabs?! If I wasn't on probation, I'd call the cops!}}
{{L|Karen|''[imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone]'' Plank-ter-ren, me old nemesis-ser! ''[Sandy and Mrs. Puff's balloon eye on their disguise deflates, but they quickly fix it]'' I've got good news-erer: I'm leaving town and going back into the "Navery," so I'm giving you me secret formuler-er-rer! ''[the disguise's arm falls off]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What? How do I know this isn't a trap-erer? Ah! You got me doing it!}}
{{L|Karen|''[imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone]'' It's a going away gift-erer.}}
{{L|''[Sandy and Mrs. Puff fall backwards and almost expose themselves. Karen slaps herself in embarrassment.]''}}
{{L|Karen|''[imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone]'' I'll get me formuler-er out of me safe-er-er-er and meet you at the Krusty Krab-er-er-er.}}
{{L|''[Plankton's thought cloud shows Mr. Krabs giving Plankton the secret formula.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|I'll meet you there, Eugene honey! ''[blow kisses]'' Kiss! ''[giggles]''}}
{{L|Sandy|I think he bought it.}}
{{L|Karen|Psst! Come on!}}
{{L|Sandy and Mrs. Puff|Whoa-whoa! Wa-whoa! Whoa! ''[fall in the dumpster]''}}
{{L|''[Plankton comes out of the Chum Bucket, humming happily. Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen giggle as Plankton enters the Krusty Krab.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|I'm here! ''[hums as he heads to the office where the formula is]''}}
{{L|''[Just then, the alarm goes off and the real Mr. Krabs arrives.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Plankton! You've interrupted me beauty sleep!}}
{{L|Plankton|Hey, Eugene. I'll just take the secret formuler-erer heh and be on my way.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[pulls out a cannon]'' Over my dead body!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[pulls out a ray gun]'' Whatever you say, Welcher!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs and Plankton begin a brawl inside the Krusty Krab. Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen laugh together.]''}}
{{L|Karen|Y'know, you're right, Sandy. I do feel so much better! ''[shows the word "Gal Pals" on her screen]''}}
{{L|Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen|Gal pals!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs blasts Plankton out of the Krusty Krab and sends him flying off into the distance. The scene changes to Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen outside of SpongeBob's house.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|I'm not so sure about pranking SpongeBob. He can't help he's insufferable.}}
{{L|Sandy|Nobody likes a good prank more than SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Mm. Okay.}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff takes out a ruler and unlocks the door. Sandy and Mrs. Puff sneak into SpongeBob's house while Karen stand outside as a look-out. Sandy and Mrs. Puff come back out with SpongeBob sleep on his bed's mattress. SpongeBob slides off the mattress and continues sleeping. Sandy then quietly slips a helmet on his head.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Virtual reality helmet, engaged.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob murmurs in his sleep and the girls laugh at him.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Shh, shh. All right, Karen. You're up.}}
{{L|''[Karen turns on her screen and makes the sound of a doorbell ringing.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[wakes up]'' Huh? C-coming!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob sees through the virtual reality helmet as sees his house. He walks up to Sandy and turns her as if he's opening the door. Then he sees Mrs. Puff as Norton.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hello? Can I help you?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[via Norton]'' Hello, Mr. SpongeBob. I'm just here to deliver your driver's license. ''[gives SpongeBob a card in order to fool him into thinking it's his driver's license]'' Congratulations.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, uh, thanks—''[gasps]'' My driver's license! ''[his "license" winks at him]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[via Norton]'' And your new boat! ''[shows SpongeBob a shopping in order to fool him into thinking it's his boatmobile]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My new boat! ''[jumps in his shopping cart]'' Whoa, wow! ''[mutters excitedly]'' Am I dreaming? ''[sees flying pineapples and a pterodactyl through the helmet]'' Nope, it's for real. ''[Sandy and Mrs. Puff shake the shopping cart to fool SpongeBob into thinking he's driving; Through the helmet, he sees bystanders waving at him. Including a talking banana]'' Look at me, everyone! I'm driving! I'm driving!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[shudders]'' Oh! That voice. Yes, you're driving! You're driving me crazy! ''[gasps and laughs maliciously]'' I know! Let's make the road really bumpy!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff lifts up the shopping cart and crashes it back and forth while losing her sanity.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wha-what? Whoa! ''[falls down]'' Whoa! Ow! ''[Mrs. Puff murmurs angrily]'' Hm, those are some potholes.}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff breathes heavily from her insanity.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Whoa, girl! Easy there. Maybe it's about time we let SpongeBob in on the joke.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[punches herself and calmly regains her sanity]'' Okay. I'll tell him. SpongeBob—''[notices SpongeBob driving away]'' SpongeBob!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob laughs as he drives away in the shopping cart. Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen scream and chase after SpongeBob. SpongeBob runs over a rock, spins and continues to drive. Sandy and Mrs. Puff ride onto Karen.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Poor little guy! This is all my fault!}}
{{L|Sandy|No, Puff! This is all my fault!}}
{{L|Karen|''[her screen shows "Gal Pals" on it]'' Gal pals!}}
{{L|Sandy|Not now, Karen!}}
{{L|Karen|Sorry.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs and sees a crowd cheering for him through the helmet]'' Ooh, a turn. Better use my hand signals.}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob! Look out!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob grabs onto a one way sign and swings the shopping cart the other direction. Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen continue to follow him. As SpongeBob drives the shopping cart, he causes a major pile up on the road.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving! ''[laughs and waves the card around]'' Look, I got a license. ''[two boats collide and Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff emerge from the smoke; SpongeBob giggles]'' Whoo! Nothing but me and miles of road! ''<nowiki>[giggles as he is ending to a brick wall] near a construction site]</nowiki>''}}
{{L|Sandy|We gotta stop this cart, gal pals!}}
{{L|''[The background changes into red, orange, and yellow sunlights. Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen reach SpongeBob and grab onto the shopping cart.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Whoa! Whoa! ''[sees the brick wall saying the words, "Dead End"]'' I'll save you, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|''[Mrs. Puff jumps onto SpongeBob and the shopping cart loses control. They crash through the brick wall and the all descend down into the construction site.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now I'm flying! ''[sees clouds through the helmet]'' Whee!}}
{{L|''[Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff fall into the shopping cart as it hits the ground. Mrs. Puff inflates herself and SpongeBob lands safely on her. Mrs. Puff deflates her body.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh? Huh? Huh. ''[sees the cloud through the helmet and Mrs. Puff takes it off of his head]'' Huh? ''[Mrs. Puff laughs sheepishly]'' Mrs. Puff? Oh, I see. You guys played a prank on me, huh? I love pranks! ''[laughs]'' Thank you, thank you, thank you! You gave me a chance to live my driving dream. And most importantly...''[hugs Mrs. Puff]'' Mrs. Puff saved my life! Now I will stay by your side forever! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh, no! No!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob flies around Mrs. Puff. Sandy grabs Mrs. Puff and the hop back onto Karen. They all run away from SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh? Oh, you girls got me again! ''[laughs, puts the helmet back on and moves around in midair]'' Vroom! Vroom!}}
{{L|Sandy|I know somewhere where we can finish our ladies night in peace.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to Sandy's treedome where Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen are seen as amoebas.]''}}
{{L|Karen|''[laughs]'' Good one. ''[laughs]'' This was a great idea, Sandy.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Yeah, what a nice place to relax.}}
{{L|''[Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen drink their hot chocolate and get whipped cream on their faces. They like off the whipped cream and sigh. All of a sudden, SpongeBob comes in as an amoeba.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Vroom, vroom! Honk, honk! Beep, beep! Oh, look at me, Mrs. Puff! I'm driving! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[Then Plankton and Mr. Krabs come in as amoebas continuing their brawl over the Krabby Patty secret formula.]''}}
{{L|Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen|''[sighs]'' Men. ''[Karen shows her screen "Gal Pals" on it through the microscope lens]'' Gal pals!}}
