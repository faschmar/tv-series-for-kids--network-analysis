{{L|SpongeBob|Grampy Joe?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Slaps his head]'' Ooh! No! Now, this'll be a great learning experience for you, so keep yer brain peeled!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[peels his head off, revealing his brain]'' Can do, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And in the tradition of the event, we are required to travel cheaply, and I'm gonna teach ya the cheapest way to do it!}}
{{L|''[Cut to a hotel where all the cheapskates are meeting. A mailman drops a heavy envelope on the front desk. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob come out]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Attention, cheapskate attendees! I, Eugene Krabs, have only spent on me travel, the price of a one-cent stamp! ''[The crabs start cheering]'' Thank you! Thank you! I'd like to see someone top that!}}
{{L|''[Suddenly, another crab comes out of a suitcase]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Gasp]'' Chintzy McGee?!}}
{{L|Chintzy McGee|Thanks for letting me hitch your ride, Mr. Krabs! I didn't have to spend a penny on travel!}}
{{L|Crabs|Oooh! ''[One of them says, "Snap!" and snaps his finger]''}}
{{L|Chintzy McGee|''[To SpongeBob]'' Better wish him luck, kid. He'll need it. ''[Leaves]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good luck, Mr. Krabs- ''[Mr. Krabs grabs his mouth]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Come on. ''[Leaves]''}}
{{L|''[Cut to hotel room door. An employee carries their bags to their hotel room]''}}
{{L|Employee|Your room, sir. ''[Holds out hand]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You see that, laddie? That outstretched hand is one of the biggest dangers to becoming a true cheapskate: ''[whispers]'' He wants a tip.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Whispers]'' What's a tip?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It means he wants money for nothing. ''[pulls out a quarter with a string attached to it]'' So watch closely. ''[Drops it on employee's hand]'' There ye are, lad.}}
{{L|Employee|Wow. A quarter. You, sir, are a real cheapskate.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Why, thank you! ''[Employee walks away]'' Now watch closely, boy! You give it a little lean, and then... snatch it back! ''[pulls on string. The quarter flies away from the employee's hand]''}}
{{L|Employee|Oh. Like I haven't seen that gag ten times today. ''[quarter flies back to Mr. Krabs' hand, who laughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Go ahead! Give it a try!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye aye, sir! ''[pulls out another quarter]'' Here you are, sonny! A nice, shiny- ''[turns to see another employee, who is very big and ugly]'' quarter. ''[SpongeBob gives it to him, who grapples tightly onto the quarter, then leaves]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Go on, boy! The quarter's getting away!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob pulls the string, but lures the big employee back to him, and squashes him, the big employee gets up, and he is stuck to his butt]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Quit foolin' around! I got an award to win! ''[He pulls SpongeBob out and leaves]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My quarter! ''[the big employee leaves with the quarter stuck to his butt]''}}
{{L|''[They walk into a room full of cheapskate crabs who are chatting]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hi, fellers! ''[He laughs, the crowd laughs, and SpongeBob attempts to laugh like them]''}}
{{L|One of the crabs|Ye still know the cheapskate handshake?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Of course. ''[They start the handshake]''}}
{{L|Both|Penny pinchin', penny pinchin'. ''[They pinch each other's butts, then act like chickens]'' Cheep cheep cheep! ''[They peck the ground, then sighed]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'd like to introduce me fellow fry cook, SpongeBob. I've been giving some pointers.}}
{{L|Crab|Ah! Training in the cheapskate arts, eh? Yer learning from the master, kiddo!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I cook Krabby Patties.}}
{{L|Crab|Yes. Sure you do. Later, Krocs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Lad, you're surrounded by stingy wisdom, so try to pick up some pointers. But whatever you do, don't lend anyone money. ''[He sees SpongeBob lending money to a crab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Twenty five, twenty six- ''[They both see Mr. Krabs. The crab then walks away with the cash]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Let's mangle.}}
{{L|Judge|Attention, penny pinchers! ''[pinches his claw]''}}
{{L|Crabs|''[confused, then pinches their claws. Laughter]''}}
{{L|Judge|It's time to award the trophy ''[pulls out trophy]'' for this year's Cheapest Crab! ''[The golden trophy shows a claw pinching a penny]''}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob sit down to watch a video]''}}
{{L|Judge|And the nominees are: Eugene Krabs! In: "Sign of the Times!"}}
{{L|''[The video shows Mr. Krabs putting out a "Free Krabby Patties" sign. Audience gasps. customers comes to Krusty Krab. A "$1.00 per footstep" sign is put out]''}}
{{L|Crowd|"Huh?" "A dollar per footstep?" "I can't afford that!" ''[they're confused]''}}
{{L|Harold|How do I get out of here? ''[He, along with others, struggle not to walk too much. Mr. Krabs laughs. Applause]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Thank you, thank you!}}
{{L|Judge|Next up is Buford Bargain Bottom in: "Convenience Store Caper!"}}
{{L|''[Video shows a customer walking to Buford, the cashier, with a bag of chips. Buford scans it three times]''}}
{{L|Customer|Uh, you charged me three times.}}
{{L|Buford|Yeah. Three times the flavor, three times the price! ''[Applause]''}}
{{L|Judge|And Dwight T. Wad in: "Tying Up Loose Ends!"}}
{{L|''[Video shows Wad tying used toilet paper to a roll of new toilet paper. Applause]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uh, geez. I didn't think the competition would be so stiff this year! ''[To SpongeBob]'' I'm gonna need your help on this one! ''[Runs to whisper something to the judge]''}}
{{L|Judge|Well, that's highly unconventional, but okay. We will now hear a testimony from a Krusty Krab employee! ''[Mr. Krabs gets SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I need ya to testify about how cheap I am! So if you need to do a little exaggeratin'... ''[his eyelids move twice. SpongeBob winks. Mr. Krabs winks four times. wink. two eyelids and a wink. wink]'' Ye not getting it, are ye? ''[SpongeBob shakes his head]'' Exaggeratin' is like tellin' the truth, only with little lies sprinkled in to make it, uh... true...er.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Gasp]'' You're teaching me to lie?! Lying is wrong, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No, no, no, no, no, no, exaggeratin's completely different from lyin'. You're taking the truth, and just seasoning it with little lies. I mean, just because you put salt on a Krabby Patty... it doesn't make it a salty patty. Does it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No. ''[he is pushed onto the stage]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, good enough. Just make sure you exaggerate enough fer me to win! ''[Throws SpongeBob to the mic]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[speaks through mic]'' Um, uh, uh, uh... Mr. Krabs has always been very, uh... very...very red.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Slap]'' Exaggerate!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Blue!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No! About me being cheap!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, Mr. Krabs is... a very generous employer. ''[The audience gasps, including Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No, no, no, no, exaggerate the other way!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um, he's not doing it for the money. He is doing it for his loyal employees. ''[The crabs talk to each other about this]'' Vacation time, regular raises, profit sharing. To Mr. Krabs, he's such a little gift that he's to glad to give us, so that he can see the looks on our faces when he hands us our paychecks. ''[Mr. Krabs faints]''}}
{{L|Judge|We've heard enough. ''[pushes SpongeBob away, points to Mr. Krabs on the floor]'' Disqualified!}}
{{L|''[Cut to hotel room. Mr. Krabs is packing up, but also sobbing into his suitcase]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, Mr. Krabs, you left some bitter tears on the nightstand.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Sniff]'' Thanks. ''[Puts tears in suitcase]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Cheer up, Mr. Krabs. You may have not won the award, but you taught this sponge a lot about stinginess. Ooh! I almost forgot to pack these hotel toiletries! ''[Puts them away]'' And let's not forget these hotel towels! ''[Puts them away]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But...but isn't that stealing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Stealing? Phhhht! We're exaggerating!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Heh heh. Well, could we "exaggerate" this pillow, too?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, only if you help me "exaggerate" this air conditioner!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Sure, boy! But why not "exaggerate" the whole wall? ''[They laugh, then start taking the room and its walls apart. They exit with their huge suitcases full of parts of the room]'' Well, I didn't win the award, but it's been nice exaggeratin' with you, boy. ''[They laugh again]''}}
{{L|''[Cut to lobby]''}}
{{L|Employee|Do you have any hotel property in this bag?}}
{{L|Judge|Preposterous! This is all mine! ''[Pats his suitcase, which opens and reveals hotel property. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob pull their bags in]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Heh heh heh. Looks like he bit off more than he could chew. ''[The bags explode, revealing the hotel room like it was]''}}
{{L|Judge|''[Gasp]'' You took the entire hotel room?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Duh! ''[Wags finger]'' Exaggerated! ''[The crabs give an applause]''}}
{{L|Judge|That is the stingiest display I've ever seen. I declare you the new winner! ''[gives trophy to Mr. Krabs, who laughs]'' See ye next year! ''[exits, then pulls on a string. The trophy flies back to him, then he leaves]''}}
<font color="red">{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[doesn't care and talks to SpongeBob]'' Thanks for ruinin' everything so I could win! Put er there, SpongeBob, me boy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure. ''[holds out hand. SpongeBob holds out his hand, but chopped SpongeBob's hand off.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oops. ''[They laugh]''}}</font>
