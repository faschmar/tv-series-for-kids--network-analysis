{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[Scene begins at the Krusty Krab with Old Man Walker walking into a pole]''}}
{{L|Old Man Walker|Oh! Pardon me, young lady. ''[Takes glasses off to get a better look]'' What a fox. ''[Walks over to Condiment Island, and puts a bottle of ketchup on his tray. Plankton is in the ketchup bottle]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Makes an evil laugh]'' Ooh! ''[His machine detects a Krabby Patty. Makes another evil laugh.]'' You're all mine you sweet Krabby Patty. Ooh hoo-hoo-hoo! Ah ha ha ha ha ha! ''[Alarm goes off inside the ketchup bottle, and Plankton buckles himself]'' Initiating launch sequence. ''[Puts on a mask and zips his eye zipper closed, but unzips mouth zipper]'' Krabby Patty, here I come!}}
{{L|Old Man Walker|''[holding ketchup bottle unsteadily]'' Eh, eh... I hope I don't miss again. ''[Old Man Walker presses the bottle but he points the bottle forward, missing the patty and releasing Plankton]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Reunited, and it's gonna feel so good! ''[Unzips eye zipper, screams as he crashes through the wall. Squidward makes a shocked expression and he looks at the hole]'' D'oh!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[He sweats and he has dollar bills covering his eyes]'' Ooh, ooh, ooh, sweet wampum. ''[Plankton bounces around his office]'' Huh! What's that? ''[He hides under his desk for protection]'' Squidward, where are you? Shield me with your forehead! ''[Plankton finally lands right next to the desk, and Mr. Krabs picks him up]'' So, it was just another failed Krabby Patty theft attempt by my ''[Close-up. He spits saliva at Plankton as he talks]'' arch-competitor, Plankton! ''[Laughs]'' For a second there, I mistook you for a threat. But you're just a dirty little man. ''[He flicks Plankton away]'' So long, shrimp! ''[An actual shrimp who is exiting the Krusty Krab turns around]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[flies towards the Chum Bucket]'' Curse you, Mr. Krabs! ''[collides into the wall of the Chum Bucket]'' Ow! ''[lands on the ground]'' Ouch! ''[Plankton walks into the Chum Bucket, sighing]''}}
{{L|Karen|So, typical day of failure, I see, huh, darling?}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, can it, computer wife. Can't you see I'm exhausted? Why don't you go make yourself useful and synthesize me up some grub? ''[opens the fridge to get a can of soda]''}}
{{L|Karen|Yes, your majesty. ''[Holographic meatloaf appears on the table that Plankton's sitting at. Plankton sits at his table.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What do we got here? ''[Uses his fork on the holographic meatloaf. Sarcastically]'' Oh, goody. Holographic meatloaf again! ''[pounds the table, knocking the meatloaf off the table]'' When am ''I'' gonna get some ''real'' food? Mr. Krabs gets to eat real food. Just look at his daughter, she's as big as a whale! I wish I could be successful like Mr. Krabs. ''[opens his can of soda that he got from his fridge]'' I wish I could somehow just switch lives with him. Just to know what it's like. ''[Drinks some soda]''}}
{{L|Karen|Then why don't you just use that "Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier" thing you built last Tuesday? ''[Plankton spits out his soda]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What a brilliant idea! Your parents must have been like, part computer or something. ''[Karen sighs. Plankton sits down in front of the Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier]'' Now, let's see here. ''[A picture of a jellyfish shows up on the Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier]'' No... ''[a dolphin appears]'' no... ''[a mermaid appears]'' no... ''[Finally, a picture of a crab in the shape of Mr. Krabs shows up]'' A-ha! ''[Plankton is buckled up]'' Well, I hate to leave you, Karen, but you know what they say... a rolling stone gathers no algae. ''[Plankton presses a button, and then goes through a hole of space and time and screams. Plankton stops for a few seconds to get a drink of soda. He smacks his lips afterwards]'' Ahh... ''[he then resumes screaming. Later, Plankton wakes up at Mr. Krabs' desk]'' Ugh... dear Neptune above, what happened last night? Huh, what's this? ''[Plankton picks up a name plate reading "Mr. Plankton" instead of "Mr. Krabs"]'' Mr. Plankton? ''[Plankton picks up a picture of Pearl]'' Who the Davey? ''[Plankton looks out the office windows and sees people eating Krabby Patties]'' Ehh... I'm in the Krusty Krab... and that means the life switcher was a success! The Krusty Krab is mine! ''[Plankton sees himself dressed]'' Corporate casual!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Order up! Two deluxe Krabby Patties.}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|''[Plankton's eye turns into a Krabby Patty]'' At last!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[SpongeBob delivers food to customer]'' There you are, sir. Two deluxe... ''[Plankton appears at the table]'' Ahoy there, Mr. Plankton.}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Er, um, hey there, uh, SpongeBob. Uh, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[Steam coming out of his mouth]'' Yes, sir?}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|I'm gonna need to take one of these Patties back to my office for um, bun inspection.}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|I'm afraid you can't do that, Mr. Plankton!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Why- why not?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Because that Patty is for the customer, sir!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|The customer? I'll boil the customer in hot oil, and rip out his— ''[SpongeBob's eyes point to Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson, who's the customer, to stop Plankton]'' I mean, yes, of course, for the lovely... customer.}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[SpongeBob gives Plankton two Krabby Patties]'' But you can take these Patties, sir. I made them in the off chance that you'd decide to instigate some bun inspection today, Mr. Plankton, sir!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Uhh... yes, uh, very nice. Um, thanks. ''[Plankton runs back to his office]'' All mine, it's finally all mine! The Patties... ''[shows Mr. Plankton's rich wealth in his money vault]'' The wealth... ''[shows business award and Clams Magazine award frames on the wall]'' The notoriety! The... ''[Plankton sees SpongeBob in his office]'' SpongeBob, what do you want?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Well, it's just that it's Tuesday again, sir, and I was wondering if I could have my, um... weekly performance review!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Review?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Oh, yes, please, sir, please!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|But I've never reviewed anything... except those foreign exercise videos my cousin sent me.}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Oh, please, sir! I want to make you so happy and proud!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Eh, you're doing fine. Now leave me to my work. ''[kisses one of the two Krabby Patties]''}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|But, sir!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|I thought I sent you away, cretin!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|But, sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. Anything!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|All right, the sauce.}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' Wh-what?}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|The sauce. I don't know. You're using too much sauce, okay? Review's over.}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[SpongeBob's eyes squint, his nose droops, and his mouth becomes tiny. Jerkily moves arms forward and back each time he stutters...]'' Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|What?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|What's the matter with you? All I said was "A little too much sauce." It's no big deal, really.}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|What do you want from me, a promotion?!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[SpongeBob's face changes back to normal]'' A pro- a promo- a promotion?!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Uh, sure, kid, you're uh... you're on register now.}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[Gasps excitedly]'' Register! ''[SpongeBob explodes. Plankton gets back to the Krabby Patties]''}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Glad that's over. ''[Kisses the same Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe Squidward|''[Squidward standing at the cash register reading a book, when he realizes that SpongeBob is standing right next to him]'' SpongeBob, do you remember that little talk we had about "personal space"?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe Squidward|''[SpongeBob points out his badge that says "Co-Cashier"]'' Co-Cashier?!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|''[Plankton is sitting at a table with the two Krabby Patties.]'' So, have you two known each other long? ''[Candle suddenly extinguishes by itself as the door opens suddenly]'' Huh?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe Squidward|''[Squidward storms into Mr. Plankton's office]'' You can't do this to me, Mr. Plankton! If you think I'm going to stand out there all day listening to... ''[Cuts to SpongeBob, whose mouth splits in two while SpongeBob talks rubbish]''}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah... ''[Cuts back to Squidward]''}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe Squidward|Then you must have coral wedged in your frontal lobe!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|So what do you want me to do about it?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe Squidward|I'd like my view to be a little less yellow, if you know what I mean.}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|''[Squidward's now the fry cook, standing in front of the grill]'' Hope you like gray. ''[Hops off the window between the cashier stand and the grill]''}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Hey, Squidward, I can see you through this little window! ''[Alternate-Universe Squidward groans.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|''[Mr. Plankton heads back to his office]'' Now, no more intrusions! I'd like to begin writing the memoirs of my success story, so everyone just stay the—}}
{{L|Pearl Plankton|''[Pearl Plankton runs inside the Alternate-Universe Krusty Krab. Mr. Plankton is being bounced up and down as she runs in.]'' Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! ''[Jumps up and down, making him bounce again]''}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Just tell Daddy what you want! Oof! He's very busy!}}
{{L|Pearl Plankton|Could I please have a um... an advance on my allowance?}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|If it'll get you out of my antennae. ''[Plankton gives Pearl a one dollar bill]'' Go crazy.}}
{{L|Pearl Plankton|$1?! You ''hate'' me! ''[Pearl begins to cry. Mr. Plankton gasps at the closeup of the enormous tears. Mr. Plankton attempts to dodge all of the tears, but a drop ends up landing in his mouth, making him a circle]''}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|''[falls over]'' Ow!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson|''[walks out and angrily flattens Plankton, getting all of the tears out]'' You!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Me?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson|You think this is funny?}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|In a cosmic sort of way, yes. (In Latin Spanish, Plankton says "If I wasn't here, yes.")}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson|Well, Mr. Funny Man, is this how you get your sick kicks?! ''[Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson shows Mr. Plankton a Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|What? It's just an ordinary Krabby— ''[Scene zooms in to show the patty made with gross-out items like wood, eyeball and more]'' Oh, my goodness!! Squidward!!!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[Alternate-Universe SpongeBob appears at the table, next to Mr. Plankton]'' I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did.}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Oh, what now?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name! ''[Repeatedly screams out "Soiled it!" for a very long time]''}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|I command you to stop that! Stop that and return to your post! ''[Mr. Plankton pushes his hand is Alternate-Universe SpongeBob's chest, in hopes that he'll stop]'' Where's the off button on this thing?}}
{{L|Pearl Plankton|''[Pearl Plankton walks up to Mr. Plankton]'' Okay, Daddy. I've decided I'm gonna run away! Run away and find a ''new'' daddy!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Make it stop! ''[A siren horn then goes off and then everyone becomes silent, including Alternate-Universe SpongeBob]'' What, did I say the secret word?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|No, sir, he's back.}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Who's back? What? ''[Something red flashes by]'' What was that?!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[An alarm sounds]'' Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover! ''[All the Alternate-Universe customers scream, and run to take cover]''}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|''[he runs in circles]'' Take cover from what?!?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[Alternate-Universe SpongeBob's up in the crow's nest searching for him]'' He's around here somewhere. ''[Alternate-Universe SpongeBob sees the red flash by once again]'' There he goes!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe Harold Bill Reginald Scott|Some say he crawled out from the lowest trench in the ocean.}}
{{L|Pearl Plankton|He's the saltiest of all the sea dogs.}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom. ''[The red flash then bursts out of the kitchen and we then see it is Krabs holding a Krabby Patty while swinging on a rope]''}}
{{L|Krabs|And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|Krabs?! What the barnacles is going on here?!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant.}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|That's terrible!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Yeah! But the worst part is...}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|''[Krabs lands behind him. Shows a Dutch-angle, low-angle shot of naked Mr. Krabs and Mr. Plankton is surprised]'' Good grief, he's naked! ''[A part of Krabs then glints]''}}
{{L|Krabs|''[Swings up onto a board on a support beam above and yelling like Tarzan's]'' Clothe me if you can, silly landlubbers!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs! ''[The cash register spins upside down, and turns into a place where a cannon is located. Alternate-Universe SpongeBob shoots a green shirt out of the cannon at Krabs, but Krabs dodges the shirt and runs somewhere else in the Alternate-Universe Krusty Krab while laughing.]'' No shirt, no shoes... no service! ''[SpongeBob shoots all the other clothes out of the cannon at Krabs, but all of them miss]''}}
{{L|Krabs|Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar! ''[Krabs stops laughing, as he realizes that a bra has caught him]'' Aw, ya got me! Well, at least it's underwire. Here's your stinkin' Patty! ''[Krabs throws the Krabby Patty back to Mr. Plankton]''}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|''[catches the Krabby Patty]'' I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech! ''[Alternate-Universe SpongeBob and all the other Alternate-Universe customers start screeching, except for Mr. Plankton, who's hearing all that screeching.]''}}
{{L|Krabs|Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!}}
{{L|Krabs|Oh, but I will! Even if I have to come back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day... ''[Mr. Plankton's red pupil from his yellow eye shrinks and starts sweating as he starts to become scared]'' And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, ''[Krabs leaves the Alternate-Universe Krusty Krab, walking backwards.]'' and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...}}
{{L|Alternate-Universe SpongeBob|''[Alternate-Universe SpongeBob hands Mr. Plankton a phone]'' Phone call, Mr. Plankton.}}
{{L|Krabs|''[On the phone]'' And the next day, and the next day, ''[Mr. Plankton sweats]'' and the next day, and the next day...}}
{{L|Mr. Plankton|''[screams out of madness, then rips off his clothes and becomes the old Plankton again]'' It's not worth it! It's just not worth it! Goodbye, everyone. I'll remember you all in therapy. ''[Plankton presses the button for the Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier. He ends up back in the Chum Bucket. Holographic meatloaf is on the table]'' Holographic meatloaf? My favorite! ''[Plankton starts eating it, and is happy again as the episode ends.]''}}
