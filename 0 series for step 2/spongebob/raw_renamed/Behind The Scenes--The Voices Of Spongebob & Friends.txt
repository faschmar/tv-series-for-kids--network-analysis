* '''Mr. Krabs: '''SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda... different.
* '''SpongeBob: '''Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my...
* '''Mr. Krabs: '''''[snaps fingers] ''Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on. ''[puts hat on SpongeBob's head] ''Knew I'd figure it out. ''[walks away]''
* '''Tom Kenny:''' The most important thing to remember about SpongeBob is that he's hyperactive.
* '''SpongeBob:''' ''[shouting karate yells and running in circles]''
* '''Tom Kenny:''' Very sweet, very open.
* '''SpongeBob: '''I am SpongeBob and this is Patrick. ''[laughs nervously]''
* '''Tom Kenny: '''And no malice whatsoever towards anyone.
* '''Mr. Krabs: '''Hold on there, SpongeBob. Let me show you your new station. It's kind of a promotion. Sorta.
* '''SpongeBob:'''  A promotion? ''[scene cuts to SpongeBob being lowered in the well by a bucket] ''Why do I have to go down in the well?
* '''Mr. Krabs: '''To collect the money!
* '''SpongeBob: '''Thanks for the promotion.
* '''Bill Fagerbakke: '''Go back to second grade and think of the best buddy you had when you were seven and that's Patrick.
* '''SpongeBob: '''Patrick, this is a wishing well. Just throw in a coin and make a wish.
* '''Patrick:''' Okay, magical talking trashcan. ''[takes out a coin from his pocket]'' I wish SpongeBob were here to see this. ''[throws himself and the coin down the well]''
* '''SpongeBob: '''Patrick.
* '''Rodger Bumpass: '''Squidward to me, is an artistic, self-important, curmudgeon.
* '''SpongeBob: '''What's the first thing you're gonna wish for?
* '''Squidward:''' To be far away from you as possible.
* '''Rodger Bumpass:''' He goes from quiet sarcasm with SpongeBob and Patrick, to apoplexy which is one of the things I like about him. He's got a wide range of things that he does.
* '''Squidward:''' SpongeBob, why aren't those patties ready?
* '''SpongeBob/Tom Kenny: '''You can't rush perfection.
* '''Squidward/Rodger Bumpass: '''I'm not rushing perfection. I'm rushing you.
* '''SpongeBob/Tom Kenny:''' ''[laughs]'' Always the kidder, Squidward.
* '''Tom Kenny: '''Always the kidder, Squidward.
* '''Rodger Bumpass:''' Again, Tom messed up.
* '''Tom Kenny:''' It's always the kidder, Squidward. Not always the kidder eh, Squidward?
* '''SpongeBob:''' ''[laughs]'' Always the kidder, Squidward.
* '''Squidward/Rodger Bumpass: '''Oh, this job stinks! But at least I'm not digging ditches.
* '''Mr. Krabs/Clancy Brown: '''''[enters the Krusty Krab]'' Squidward, SpongeBob, I got a new job for ya.
* '''Clancy Brown: '''Mr. Krabs is a avaricious crustacean fast food gourmand. Who's main love is the dollar.
* '''Mr. Krabs/Clancy Brown:''' You mean suckers throw in money down a hole for fun? That's the greatest scam ever.
* '''Clancy Brown: '''Well, the dollar after his daughter...I think...maybe.
* '''King Krabs:''' Thou must hand over thy village and thy throne or thy daughter shall be dipped into a cauldron of lava?! Pearl! ''[Pearl screams]''
* '''Patrick: '''I guess this is what you call the royal treatment.
* '''Bill Fagerbakke:''' Patrick and I share probably more than anything else, personal hygiene...I think.
* '''Squidward:''' Patrick!
* '''Patrick: '''''[shoves Squidward]'' And stop stepping in my potato salad.
* '''Bill Fagerbakke:''' I think our diet is similar....I live under a rock.
* '''Patrick:''' ''[comes out from under his rock drinking coffee and then eats the coffee mug]''
* '''Bill Fagerbakke: '''''[burps]''' '''''That wasn't a very good one. ''[burps again and does Patrick's laugh]''
* '''Patrick/Bill Fagerbakke:''' ''[burps and laughs] ''I only tasted six types of sediment.
* '''SpongeBob/Tom Kenny:''' I know how to handle this: With a little karate!
* '''Tom Kenny:''' I don't think SpongeBob and I have that much in common. For one thing, SpongeBob has a very annoying laugh like ''[does SpongeBob's laugh] ''and I don't so ''[laughs] ''so that's one thing we don't have in common.
* '''Mr. Krabs/Clancy Brown: '''Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula. ''[takes out the formula]'' You know you want it.
* '''Clancy Brown:''' He's very much a crustacean, he's very tough on the outside but soft on the inside. That's what I love about him. And he hires losers. ''[laughs]''
* '''SpongeBob:''' What's going on Mr. Krabs?
* '''Mr. Krabs:''' Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.
* '''SpongeBob:''' Whatever you say, cap'n. ''[peels eyes]''
* '''Mr. Krabs:''' Now that's an employee who follows orders. 
* '''Squidly/Rodger Bumpass: '''Dost thou talketh to me?
* '''SpongeBob/Tom Kenny:''' ''[laughs]'' Good one, Squidward. ''[imitates Squidly]'' "Dost thou talketh to me?" ''[laughs]''
* '''Squidly/Rodger Bumpass: '''Scoff not, young squire. 
* '''Rodger Bumpass:''' The real life person that influences my character of Squidward is me. ''[laughs]'' I am Squidward, there's no acting involved.
* '''SpongeBob and Patrick:''' ''[raise up from behind the couch making noises. Squidward spits out his chocolate]''
* '''Mr. Krabs:''' ''[laughs]'' Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?
* '''Clancy Brown:''' ''[does Mr. Krabs' laugh]'' That's all I do to get into character.
* '''Squidward:''' Could you not stand so close? You're making me claustrophobic.
* '''Patrick/Bill Fagerbakke:''' What does claustrophobic mean?
* '''SpongeBob/Tom Kenny:''' It means he's afraid of Santa Claus.
* '''Squidward:''' No, it doesn't.
* '''Patrick/Bill Fagerbakke:''' Ho, ho, ho! ''[giggles]''
* '''SpongeBob/Tom Kenny:''' Stop it, Patrick, you're scaring him!
* '''Patrick/Bill Fagerbakke:''' Ho, ho, ho!
* '''Squidward:''' It's not working, Patrick.
* '''Patrick: '''Darn.
* '''Tom Kenny:''' It's nice to just come into the studio and just become this really nice, positive, hyperactive freak for 4 hours.
* '''SpongeBob/Tom Kenny: '''''[screaming]''
* '''Rodger Bumpass:''' It's like this all the time here too. It's amazing it never gets finished.
* '''Clancy Brown, Tom Kenny, and Rodger Bumpass:''' ''[walk out of restroom stumbling]''
* '''Tom Kenny: '''That was cartoon madness.
