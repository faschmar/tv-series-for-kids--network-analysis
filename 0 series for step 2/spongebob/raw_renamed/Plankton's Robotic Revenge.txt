{{L|Captain|First, mate, ship's radio is dead. Get some new batteries in the double.}}
{{L|Sailor|Right away, sir. I will just-- Whoa. Uh, oh.}}
{{L|Karen|What was that?}}
{{L|Plankton|That Karen, was the sound of my dreams becoming reality.}}
{{L|Karen|You're getting taller?}}
{{L|Plankton|Taller, no. But, I definitely will be moving up in the world. ''[Laughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What?}}
{{L|Plankton|Ahem. Now, Krabs, kneel before me and my technological superiority. Your flemisy defenses are no match for my super charge exoskeleton and robot minions. The Krabby Patty Formula's is mine. Mine! ''[Laughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You'll need more than the tin clown suit to out with me, Plankton? The Krabby Patty Formula is perfectly safe in my new uptersecur-- Oh. Safe.}}
{{L|Plankton|You mean this? Ultra Secure Safe? I'll have this open in no time.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Get back with me safe, Plankton.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Thank Poseidon you're here, boy. Plankton is stolen me safe with the Krabby Patty Formula in it. Even does he know that the safer acquires special key to open it. I made three copies of the key and hidden them in three secret locations marked on these map.}}
{{L|Plankton|Thank you.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, no!}}
{{L|''[Three hours later.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Nooooo!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I have an idea!}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob has an idea! We're saved! We're saved!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What is it, boy?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|OK. All we have to do is get a giant speaker system and play sad music about a lonely trucker really loud. Next, we'll have a BBQ and start cooking hotdogs, baked bananas and sauerkraut. Then using electric fencing, an old tuba and a litter of kittens...}}
{{L|Squidward|And how is THAT going to help?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward! Picnics always help!}}
{{L|Sandy|Wait! Why don't we all head out and find the keys before Plankton does?}}
{{L|Patrick|I like SpongeBob's idea better.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, buddy.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That's it! All we have to do is find the keys before Plankton does and the formula will be saved! Heh, So glad I thought of that!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[Sighs]'' Me too.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Use sprockets and you have collected to purchase and upgrade Gizmos. Use the Ground Slam to open Chests.}}
{{L|Plankton|Not so hard really when you realize you're dealing with a powerful intellect like mine. You see, I owe it all to these Enerjolt Power Cells. They are a source of UNLIMITED POWER! Using these babies, Karen was able to build me this freaky robot and an ENTIRE ROBOT ARMY.. Yes, yes, with a little help from the Plankton family! I assure you that I will find these blasted keys. But I have one more thing I must to do before I am on my way to world domination!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's that Plankton?}}
{{L|Plankton|Destroy the lot of you! That's what! Sick 'em boys!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We did it! Chalk up one more victory up to the forces of good.}}
{{L|Plankton|Not so fast young pore-bearer. You may have won this first battle, but I assure you that victory will be mine! My robot army will have those keys anytime now and I will finally posses the fabled formula for the Krabby Patty!}}
{{L|Patrick|What do we do now?}}
{{L|Squidward|I suggest giving up this charade and going home. Maybe a nice cup of tea before bed.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No Squidward! We've got to beat Plankton to those keys!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh brother...}}
{{L|Rainchild|We gotta find that key! Cousin Sheldon is gonna be sorer than a wet toad at a square dance if he finds out we lost it!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! Look! It's the key! It's stuck to that metal crate for brains!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|If we move quickly .. he'll never know what hit him.}}
{{L|Rainchild|Oh, I reckon I'll know what hit me, don't you worry! I mean, you just told me what you're gonna do!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on gang! Get him! Great work everyone. We did it. We have a key and another Enerjolt Power Cell. Sandy, maybe you can use this to help us to find the others!}}
{{L|Sandy|I sure can!}}
{{L|Plankton|Ok, if my calculations are correct, and of course they always are, there is another key in ROCK BOTTOM. All we have to do is... Wait a minute! Is this thing on?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Did you hear that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes sir! Plankton should really learn to control his temper.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Not that part! There's another key! We need to get there and beat him to it! C'mon!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Plankton, stop right there!}}
{{L|Clem|Uh ,excuse me? uh, yea. I'm a Plankton, but not the Plankton you want. I think that's cousin Sheldon you want, and I ain't him.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh I see. I thought you were. Cause, If you were, which I can see that you are not, I would challenge you to a battle.}}
{{L|Clem|Well, I may not be Sheldon, but I do have a key. Does this count?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh ah, why, yes... Yes it does.}}
{{L|Clem|Phew! I was a bit worried there.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Me too... Glad we cleared that up.}}
{{L|Sandy|Guys! Are you kidding me? Get him!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're right! I don't know what I was thinking!}}
{{L|Patrick|I was thinking about ice cream. Who's ready for a snack?}}
{{L|Clem|Ok, you got me. Please just let me scurry away. I won't bother you again.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not so fast! Where is Sheldon Plankton, your cousin? And where is the last key? Tell us now or...}}
{{L|Clem|Or what?}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah SpongeBob, or what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You will see sights so heinous, so terrible, so utterly unpleasant, your eyeballs will tremble just wondering what it is!}}
{{L|Patrick|I can't take it! I'll talk!}}
{{L|Clem|Ahh! Please! Leave him alone! Plankton is heading to the Krusty Krab! The last key is there! J-just don't hurt Patrick!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Incredible boy. Just incredible.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Chuckles]'' All in a day's work sir. Hey Plankton, what're you doing?}}
{{L|Plankton|Don't bother me now kid. The third key to the safe is around here somewhere and I intend to find it.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You'll never find it Plankton, because I'm the one who hid it and even I don't remember where I put it!}}
{{L|Plankton|Well the map it's around here somewhere. That, or it's a blasted SESAME SEED! I tell you, this map is confusion! Once you pesky meddlers are out of the way I will find that key and claim my rightful peace as ruler of all Bikini Bottom!}}
{{L|Patrick|Not so fast, Plankton! You have forgotten one crucial detail.}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh yeah? What's that numbskull?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah Patrick, what is it?}}
{{L|Patrick|Um. What's what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The crucial detail?}}
{{L|Patrick|Um. I forget!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Sobbing]'' Defeated again. Why isn't that even my superior intellect powerful technology and dashing good looks. I can not realize my dream of fast food sup-premises.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Perhaps, it's because you were a puny annoying pest.}}
{{L|Squidward|That's one reason.}}
{{L|Plankton|Enjoy this moment all you want, Krabs. It doesn't matter anyway. Someday soon I will find that final key and then victory is mine!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Doesn't matter? Matter? Matt-- Hold that thought. There ye are my little beauty. Now, I'll just open that safe and the Krabby Patty formula will be back in the rightful hands. "Me, formula is in your pocket." My pocket? Hmm. Ooh! And so it is. I had it with me all along. Davey Jones' Ghost, I'm clever.}}
{{L|Squidward|You mean we did all that for nothing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, all for nothing, Squidward. I think we all learn a valuable lesson.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh. And what was that, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We learned that the before you fight a giant robot army. Always remember to look in Mr. Krabs' pocket.}}
{{L|Patrick|Words to live by.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I am sure I'm glad things are back to normal here in Bikini Bottom. Say, I wonder what happened to those batteries, anyway?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, uh, what batteries?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, never mind. By the way, Patrick, the reception on your television sure is incredible.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, thank you very much. More pickles?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Two Gurkins, please?}}
