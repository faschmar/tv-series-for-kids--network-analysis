{{L|Patrick and Sandy|We... huh?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[turns off lights and turns on a slideshow and turns it to a picture of a dollar]'' I'm sure you know this charming fellow! ''[changes slide to him catching money]'' Here's the one that almost got away! ''[changes slide to a pile of money]'' Look at these pile towers of golden green! ''[changes slide to the Krusty Krab]'' Here's how the whole thing started! ''[cuts to flashback]''}}
{{L|Squidward|That will be $6.75, please. ''[Takes money from the customer]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[on a loud speaker]'' Attention! Attention, all employees of the Krusty Krab! Report immediately to the main office!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[walks off]''}}
{{L|Frankie Billy|Hey! What about my change?}}

{{L|Mr. Krabs|That's right. You better have a seat laddy. Gentlemen! I have an announcement to make. As of tomorrow, I'm closing the Krusty Krab.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hallelujah! ''[Charges out the door]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[In shock gasping]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Relax, boy! I'm just going on vacation for a few days. ''[Moves next to SpongeBob who is still in shock]'' Yesiree, laddy! I think the old Krusty Krab can afford a few days in dried up while I take little Pearl to a long, overdue vacation. And I was kinda hoping, that you come along with us, SpongeBob. ''[echo many times]'' Come along with us, SpongeBob. Come along with us...For a nominal fee of course. So, what do think, boy?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Smiles brightly]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob? ''[Starts shaking SpongeBob]'' SpongeBob!?}}

{{L|''[Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' house]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Pearl, my dear! Are you all packed and ready to go?}}
{{L|Pearl|You bet your bottom dollar!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Me bottom dollar? Why I never do that!}}
{{L|Pearl| It's just an expression daddy. I just mean I'm really excited! ''[Walks outside with Mr. Krabs and spots SpongeBob]'' Gasp!}}
{{L|SpongeBob| La la la la la la la la la!}}
{{L|Pearl|Daddy! One of your employees is in the back seat!}}

{{L|Pearl|Daddy! I thought this was supposed to be OUR family vacation!?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Eh... It still is! SpongeBob's... like a son to me! Plus he'll pay a top dollar to tag along.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|  ''[notices Pearl walk closer to Mr. Krabs' boat]'' Hi Pearl! Looks like you and I get to spend some quality time together!}}
{{L|Pearl|You know, SpongeBob. We got an old family tradition of having our guests ride on the floor with the luggage until we leave town! ''[throws her suitcase at SpongeBob knocking him to the floor]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob| ''[Raises arm up which is bent]'' I will happily honor this family tradition.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|See? You two are already having fun together! ''[laughs and drives off past SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick's houses]''}}
{{L|Squidward| ''[Laying on a chair]'' And there they go! Two whole days of no work and no SpongeBob! This is almost too good to be true! Nothing can possibly go wrong!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Appears behind Squidward]'' Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ow!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Did you hear something?}}
{{L|Pearl|Just the sound of this vacation dying!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, cheer up pumpkin puss! We're almost there!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Raises arm]'' Um, is time to come up yet?}}
{{L|Pearl|Sure, why not? Join the funeral. Super Mega Mall World? Is that where we going?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Noooo! No. The place we are going is much better! ''[Drives past Super Mega Mall World]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um, Mr. Krabs? Think we could make a bathroom stop?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But we are making such great time! Try to hold it a little longer lad!}}
{{L|Pearl|Holly molly! We're going to Planet Rollercoaster! ''[Mr. Krabs drives past it]'' But, daddy? W-why aren't we stopping?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Laughs]'' The place we are going is 100 times better than that old amusement park!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Is it Bathroom Land? 'Cause I could really use a bathroom right now!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Laughs]'' Bathroom Land! Oh, SpongeBob! You kill me!}}
{{L|Pearl|Yeah! He's a real chuckle factory. ''[laughs sarcastically]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Continues driving]'' Ok, kids! We're just about there! Just over that hill, is the greatest sight in the sea! Now close your eyes for a big surprise!}}
{{L|Pearl|''[closes eyes and crosses fingers]'' Teenage Boy Museum! Teenage Boy Museum!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Closes eyes and crosses legs]'' Bathroom! Bathroom!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Stops driving]'' Ok! We're here! You can open your eyes now!}}
{{L|Pearl|''[she and SpongeBob open their eyes]'' Yay! The Teenage Boy Museum! ''[a wrecking ball suddenly knocks down the Teenage Boy Museum]'' It was right there!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh... that's okay, honey. We weren't going there anyway. That's where we're going!}}
{{L|Pearl|Gasp!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It's the Bikini Bottom Mint! Where they make all of the money! Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in all of your life?}}
{{L|Pearl|There is no way I'm going in there! I'd rather sit through the rubble of the Teenage Boy Museum! ''[searches through the rubble]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, laddy! Looks like it's just you and me! And of course, the Mint! ''[Hearts in eyes fly off]''}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to inside the Bikini Bottom Mint]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Is this the most exciting day in you life?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not really.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Bill? ''[Laughs]''}}
{{L|Bill|and yes... I am aware of the hilarious irony between my name and my job. Now, I'll be your tour guide for today. This tour will take you through the entire money process. }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You hear that, boy? ''[Eyes in SpongeBob's face]'' The entire money making... process! }}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, I... ''[Takes Mr. Krabs' eyes off his face]'' ...sure did sir! }}
{{L|Bill|''[Leading the crowd]'' This just to your right is the first part of the dollar making process. ''[Shows the crowd people behind the glass window operating a pressing machine]'' Where very special sheets of paper are prepped for... }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Guah guah guah guah guah! ''[Starts licking the glass window]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is staring at us. ''[Shakes Mr. Krabs]'' Sir, get a hold of yourself! It's just paper! }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Just paper? That's like saying the ocean is just water! Or, or the Krabby Patty's just a... a... a sandwich! }}
{{L|Bill|Ahem... }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh! ''[Dusts off SpongeBob]'' Uh... uh... }}
{{L|Bill|''[Walks the crowd to a new area]'' And in this area here to my left, we see the process in which the sheets of silver are pressed into... ''[The machine then pounds the silver sheet into coins]'' ...shiny blank coins which are collected in back of one million pieces for the coining press. }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wuh wuh wuh... o-o-one million shiny pieces of... ''[His eyes start to inflate]'' silver coins? ''[His eyes explode with the pieces flying]''}}
{{L|Bill|They call... ''[Gets hit in the face by pieces of Mr. Krabs' eyes and the rest hit the other tourists]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh oh! I thought this might happen! ''[Takes out a box that says "Replacement Eyes" and screws the eyes into Mr. Krabs and turns him on]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Thanks SpongeBob! }}
{{L|SpongeBob|Anytime sir! Oh! The tour's leaving without us! ''[Points to Bill and the others moving forward]''}}
{{L|Bill|''[Talking with the tourists]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We better catch up with them before we miss something, right Mr. Krabs? ''[Notices Mr. Krabs is gone and looks over]'' Gasp! ''[Sees Mr. Krabs on the conveyor belt getting ready to be crushed by the machine]'' ''[yelling]'' Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|He he he he!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Pushes Mr. Krabs out of the way but gets crushed instead turning into many coins]'' I'm not sure how I feel about this sudden change! ''[Laughs]'' Good one, huh, Mr. Krabs? AHHH! ''[Reforms back together]'' Watch out, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Holding a coin and moving down the conveyor belt]'' Hello! My name is Eugene! What's yours? ''[A machine with a needle makes the face on one coin and moves up towards it]'' Do you believe in love at first sight?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Swings by and saves Mr. Krabs]'' Phew... that was close.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'd say! I almost had that quarter's phone number!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Pretty neat, huh, boy? That's where they... ''[Claw pops and his whole arm deflates and yells ]'' ...Destroy money!? No! ''[Charges to the shredder looking at the shredded money]'' ''[screaming] '' Noo! Why? Why? ''[Starts crying a fountain]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Puts buckets on both sides of Mr. Krabs]'' It's okay, sir. I'm sure I...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Arms and nose pop off as he continues to cry from all ends, starting to flood the Mint]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wah oh! ''[Feet turn into propellers and he swims toward Mr. Krabs turning a knob on him which stops him from crying then sucks up all of the tears and tries to spit them out the window but goes through the wall instead.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Finishes spitting]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Rocking on the ground speaking gibberish]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs! It's okay! ''[Picks up Mr. Krabs]'' The shredded money is recycled and turned into brand, new money! See? ''[Shows Mr. Krabs the new dollars being made]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It's a miracle!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yay!}}
{{L|Bill|''[growls angrily]'' That is it! I have had enough of your nonsense! Guards, show these good for nothing dawdlers out right now... ''[sees the guards tied up and robbers stealing money]'' Oh, my. ''[hides behind his tourists]'' Angry thieving criminals aren't part of this tour. Uh, take whatever you want!}}
{{L|Skinny Robber|Take care of them!}}
{{L|Muscular Robber|No problem, boss! ''[Growls and moves toward the crowd]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Jumps in]'' Oh no you don't! You filthy dollar wrestler! ''[Throws SpongeBob at the Muscular Robber, which has no effect]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That didn't work at all! ''[Falls to the ground]''}}
{{L|Muscular Robber|Grrrr... }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Grrrr...  ''[yelling] '' ''[Charges at the Muscular Robber and knocks him into the Skinny Robber. Uses SpongeBob to tie them up, then tosses them through the ceiling and into a police car. Both police officers calmly look at the robbers who were sent into their police car.]''}}
{{L|Male Police Officer|That was easy.}}
{{L|Female Police Officer|Yeah, it sure was.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Good work, boy! }}
{{L|SpongeBob|You, too, sir! }}
{{L|Bill|''[The crowd starts claping]'' clearly I  misjudged you are both brave citizens and for that, on behalf of the mint I would like to present you both brand new extremely fine limited-run dollar bills with your faces on them.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs|Oooooo... }}
{{L|Bill|''[Gives them their dollars]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! It's-}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Takes it]'' Mine! I haven't charged you yet for tagging along on me vacation! }}
{{L|Pearl|''(takes dollars from Mr. Krabs)'' And I haven't charged you yet for taking me on this terrible vacation. Here's the two dollars I was short on those shoes. I must've maxed out daddy's credit card. ''(give dollars to clerk, and takes shoes)'' Yay, shoes! }}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Starts to cry]'' Shoes? }}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh no... ''[Puts on rain clothes]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Bursts out bawling]''}}
{{L|''[The episode ends with the Bikini Bottom Mint spraying out Mr. Krabs' tears]''}}
