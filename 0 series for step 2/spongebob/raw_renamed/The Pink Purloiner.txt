{{L|SpongeBob|''[A bus arrives at Jellyfish Fields]'' You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets. ''[gasps as he sees a blue jellyfish]'' Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter! A two fisted Jumper! And a gold-throated stinger!}}
{{L|Gold Throated Singer|La, la, la, la, la, la, la!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick are over-shadowed]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Uhh, SpongeBob? ''[looks up and sees a bunch of colorful jellyfish above them]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable! ''[opens his case to a metal net instead of one made of bamboo sticks. He catches many jellyfish while Patrick struggles to catch one. Scene cuts to the bus stop.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net. ''[his net breaks]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloy netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.}}
{{L|Patrick|Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky. ''[shudders. Scene cuts to the bus dropping off Patrick and SpongeBob on their street]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good night, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Good night, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in his bed]'' Ah, I love jellyfishing. ''[night breaks into day quickly and the foghorn alarm goes off]'' Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable. ''[realizes he doesn't have it]'' Ol' Reliable? ''[gasps]'' It's gone! ''[runs out the door in his underwear]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, right. Pants.}}
{{L|French Narrator|One pair of pants later...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen! ''[both scream. Scene cuts to them stapling posters saying "STOLEN! OL' RELIABLE"]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Put one over there, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm all done.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Maybe we should spread out a little. ''[newspaper ad of the "Bikini Bottom Gazette" reads "STOLEN OL' RELIABLE" on the front page]''}}
{{L|Johnny|Flash. The jellyfish migration enters it second day of fantastic jellyfishing. We now go live to our reporter on the scene.}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|''[in Jellyfish Fields]'' This year's migration is the largest in a century! I feel truly sorry for the poor saps that will miss even one minute of this remarkable event. ''[SpongeBob takes Perch's microphone]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return. ''[Mr. Krabs sees this on TV at home and runs to Jellyfish Fields then appears on TV instantly]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Reward? How much we talkin' about?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|12 dollars and... ''[counts the coins]'' ...38 cents.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm on the case. ''[takes SpongeBob's money and runs off screen while Perch takes back his microphone]''}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Guys, I know it's a slow news day, but come on. ''[The scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in his chair by the phone when it rings. He picks it up.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! Hello? Hello?}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, did you get your net back?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, sorry. ''[hangs up. The phone rings again]'' Did you get your net yet?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net. ''[hangs up. The phone rings again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hello?!}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, I found your net!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?! Really, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever. ''[looks out his window and notices Patrick running around with a jellyfish net]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sighs]'' Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net. ''[gets in bed]'' Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday. ''[his eyes widen. Scene cuts to morning. Patrick walks up to SpongeBob's pineapple]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sighs]'' No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net? ''[Patrick laughs then stops]''}}
{{L|Patrick|No. ''[SpongeBob laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.}}
{{L|Patrick|A present? What is it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pulls out a bear with a microphone in its hand]'' It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.}}
{{L|Patrick|Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.}}
{{L|''[He quickly dashes off to speak for the bear.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear|Hi! My name is Confess-A-Bear! Tell me all your secrets.}}
{{L|Patrick|Um, ''[sits on the ground]'' I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened.}}
{{L|SpongeBob / Confess-A-Bear|Oh, maybe you should talk about it.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out.}}
{{L|SpongeBob / Confess-A-Bear|Tell Confess-A-Bear!}}
{{L|Patrick|I've said too much already.}}
{{L|SpongeBob / Confess-a-Bear|Tell Confess-A-Bear now! Now!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[screams]'' I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear? ''[SpongeBob runs around in the background screaming and wiping his tongue off in disgust]'' You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear? ''[scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Patrick's rock]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, we need to talk.}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmmm... ''[walks down some stairs into Patrick's rock]'' Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm in here. Be out in a second. ''[Patrick's shadow reveals himself holding a jellyfishing net]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Standing with his hands behind his back]'' Hello.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's in your hand, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[shows his left hand]'' Nothing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's in your other hand?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[grows another arm through his chest]'' Nothing in my other hand.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I gotta go.}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay, bye.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he? ''[imagines Patrick from earlier]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I would kill for a net like that! ''[takes out a carrot, breaks it in half, and laughs maniacally]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams]'' Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure. ''[scene cuts to the next day]'' Good morning, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Good morning, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What are you going to do today, buddy?}}
{{L|Patrick|Eh, nothing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[puts on his Krusty Krab hat]'' Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Bye. ''[SpongeBob walks off then sneaks into a bush in the background]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants. ''[looks through binoculars]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Eight hours later...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[still looking through binoculars]'' Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go? ''[Patrick is behind him]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?}}
{{L|Patrick|Nothing. I just finished. ''[takes out his to-do list and crosses out 'Nothing']'' Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here. ''[shudder]'' Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[yells and throws away the binoculars]'' I don't have any binoculars, see?}}
{{L|Patrick|You're acting weird.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm not acting weird! You're acting weird! ''[runs off panting]'' You're... acting... weird!}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay, bye! ''[later, SpongeBob knocks on Patrick's rock]'' Hello! Who are you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[wearing a mustache. British accent]'' Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh. No.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies hmm.}}
{{L|Patrick|What street said that? Was it this one? ''[points at the street]'' Mind your own business!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net. ''[shows a fake $1,000,000,000 bill that is colored on with crayon]'' I will pay one billion dollars for that net.}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know who you are, but you're not getting this jellyfishing net! ''[holds the jellyfishing case out]'' I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, really?}}
{{L|Patrick|You can't have it for any price.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And why not?}}
{{L|Patrick|This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[rips off the mustache. Normal voice]'' A-ha!}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, ''[puts on the mustache]'' I'm the scary mustache guy!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[screams]'' Why, SpongeBob, why?! Why would you wear such a scary mustache?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[rips off the mustache]'' Why did you steal my jellyfishing net?!}}
{{L|Patrick|What?! I'm your best friend!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You ''were'' my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!}}
{{L|Patrick|How could you think that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Because you said it! You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!}}
{{L|Patrick|Gift.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Patrick|It's my friend SpongeBob's gift. ''[opens the case up to reveal a new jellyfishing net]'' I made you a new net.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[reads inscription]'' For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you! Patrick? ''[a bunch of stuff is on the ground]''}}
{{L|''[Patrick puts the TV in the pile.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What'cha doing, best friend?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm not your best friend. I'm a no-good jelly netting thief fish!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Where are you going?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, no! ''[bus stops in front of them]'' So, this is it?}}
{{L|Patrick|Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[hands onto Patrick's left foot]'' Patrick, don't go! I'm sorry I accused you! It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me.}}
{{L|Nat Peterson|What's the holdup? Oh, it's you two. ''[shows SpongeBob his net]'' Look, you left your net on the bus again.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?}}
{{L|Nat Peterson|You do it every week. Now can we get going?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by.}}
{{L|Patrick|You're giving me Ol' Reliable? ''[cries loudly]'' I accept your apology!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, come here, you big lug! ''[both hug and cry loudly]''}}
{{L|All|Aww...}}
{{L|Nat Peterson|They do this all the time. I'm serious. I--ugh, never mind.}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!}}
{{L|Passengers|Hooray! ''[bus drives off]''}}
{{L|Patrick|You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net. ''[holds up Ol' Reliable]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So did I. ''[holds up the one Patrick made for him]'' My best friend made it for me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob & Patrick|Whee! ''[Both laugh and run into Jellyfish Fields, where the exotic jellyfish are still there.]''}}
