{{L|''[The episode begins at the Bikini Bottom Zoo. Three peacock-like clams are sleeping until they are awoken by SpongeBob's Tarzan yell. A sea tiger opens his mouth as SpongeBob makes his yell inside. SpongeBob comes out of the sea tiger's mouth with a red ball.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Timmy! I've found your ball. And...''[holds up a little girl]'' Your sister.}}
{{L|Ryan Timmy's sister|Hi!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob grabs the sea tiger's uvula and swings on it. SpongeBob gives Timmy/Ryan his sister and ball.]''}}
{{L|Ryan Timmy and his sister|''[giggles as they play ball]'' Yeah!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[lets go of the sea tiger's uvula]'' A thousand pardons, Sir Sea Tiger. ''[the sea tiger licks SpongeBob and he giggles]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob swings over to the sea elephant enclosure and hops onto the sea elephant's head.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And the elephant says... ''[the sea elephant moos like a cow and SpongeBob giggles; he slides down the sea elephant's trunk]'' Weee!!! ''[jumps onto the back of a sea giraffe's long neck]'' The giraffe goes... ''[the sea giraffe barks like a dog and throws SpongeBob to the baboon enclosure]'' And the baboon says... ''[the baboon quacks like a duck; SpongeBob giggles and is thrown out; he lands on the zookeeper's head]'' And the zookeeper goes...}}
{{L|Zookeeper|''[growls in anger as his mustache is set on fire]'' Again with this kid?! ''[SpongeBob hops off]'' How many times do I have to tell you to stay out of the animal enclosures?! They are not pets! These are wild animals! And you can get ''[teary-eyed]'' seriously injured.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pets a giant sea monster]'' These little cuties are dangerous? ''[laughs as the sea monster roars]'' Don't be silly.}}
{{L|Zookeeper|''[quivers as the sea monster looks at him; he growls angrily]'' That's it! ''[puts an ankle alarm on SpongeBob's left foot]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|For me? Thanks!}}
{{L|Zoo manager|Oh, it's not a gift, it's an ankle alarm! And the next time you try to sneak into the animal enclosures, it's gonna do this! ''[puts SpongeBob's foot with the ankle alarm through the sea monster's enclosure and the alarm blares]''}}
{{L|Alarm|SpongeBob alert! SpongeBob alert! SpongeBob alert!}}
{{L|Zookeeper|Get it?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Got it.}}
{{L|Zoo manager|Good! ''[throws SpongeBob out of the zoo]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob sighs in sadness. He secretly heads back into the zoo and tiptoes into the sea giraffe's animal enclosure without triggering his ankle alarm. He hops onto the sea giraffe's back and meows like a cat. SpongeBob and the sea giraffe giggle. The zookeeper finds SpongeBob's foot sticking out of the enclosure.]''}}
{{L|Zookeeper|''[pulls SpongeBob's foot]'' Oh, no, you don't!}}
{{L|''[The zookeeper struggles to pull SpongeBob out, but the zoo animals try to pull him back. The zookeeper continues to pull until he lifts out all of the zoo animals and gets crushed by them. SpongeBob climbs out of the animal enclosure.]''}}
{{L|Zookeeper|''[fuming with rage]'' That's it! You are banned from the zoo! Get out! Out, I say!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[shrinks to a small size from the zookeeper's outburst]'' Yes, sir. I'll go. ''[goes to leave]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[appears in the sea monkey enclosure]'' Hold it! If he goes, I go! ''[jumps out of the enclosure]'' And you can keep your dumb old peanuts! ''[throws peanut shells to the ground]'' Huh! Come on, SpongeBob. ''[leaves with SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Zookeeper|And stay out!}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to Patrick comforting a crying SpongeBob from the zookeeper's angry outburst.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, that's it now. Let it all out.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sobs]'' I-I just want to pet the critters. Does that make me an animal? ''[continues to cry]''}}
{{L|Patrick|That mean old zookeeper! ''[scratches his back]'' He even looks like a monkey and he smells like one too! ''[scoffs]'' You should just make your own zoo.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My own zoo? That's a laugh. ''[as he cries, a snot bubble forms and floats]'' Ooh... ''[catches the snot bubble]'' Are you thinking what I'm thinking? ''[the snot bubble pops]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Bubble zoo!}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to SpongeBob creating bubble animals with his bubble soap. He makes a bubble pig, a bubble duck, and a bubble rooster.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Voilà! Our first zoo animals.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[laughs]'' Oh, oh, I get to name 'em! Um, your name is Aspen. ''[pops the bubble pig]'' Your name is Audrey! ''[pops the bubble duck]'' And you're Debbie! ''[pops the bubble rooster; he then notices that he popped them all and breaks down]'' Aww, I forgot they're bubbles! ''[cries]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[brings in a big container of extra strength bubble soap and talks low]'' Don't be a dope. Try extra strength soap. ''[grabs the bubble wand, takes a very deep breath and blows a bubble penguin]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[squeezes the bubble penguin, but it doesn't pop]'' It works! It works!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[laugh as they jump up and down]'' It works! It works!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[takes another deep breath and blows more bubble animals]'' Ooh, look at 'em, Patrick. So happy and healthy. ''[a bubble rhino leaves bubble droppings]'' Oh, and look, Patrick! Bubble droppings!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[hops on SpongeBob's head]'' Bubble droppings? ''[happily leaps off and dances on the bubble droppings]'' I'm popping poops! ''[laughs before a bubble goat rips off Patrick's pants and eats it]'' Hey! ''[the bubble goat belches]'' But I was gonna eat those!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[blows a bubble pants for Patrick to wear]'' No more "buts." We need more animals! ''[inhales and blows some more bubble animals]''}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to all of the Bikini Bottom citizens attending SpongeBob and Patrick's bubble zoo.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Welcome to the Bubble Zoo! Where the price of admission is a smile. ''[stops a frowning customer]'' Just a second you. ''[turns the customer's frown upside-down]'' That's better. ''[allows the customer to enter]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[as the bubble zoo's security guard]'' Hello, folks. Please leave all your sharp objects at the gate. ''[stops Old Man Walker]'' Okay, Grandpa. Spread 'em. ''[puts on bubble gloves]''}}
{{L|''[Patrick dumps out a pizza cutter, a pencil, a cactus, darts, and a real-life echidna.]''}}
{{L|Old Man Walker|Rascal.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to SpongeBob showing the customers the bubble elephant enclosure.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gather around, folks, and meet the animals! These wild bubble-phants never forget to have fun. ''[forms into the word, "fun" and laughs; the bubble elephants blow water in SpongeBob's face and sends him flying into the bubble giraffe enclosure where the bubble giraffes are tangled up with their necks]'' These bubble-raffes are necking. And they have the necks for it. ''[laughs as the bubble giraffes untangle themselves; SpongeBob's watch beeps]'' Ooh, time to feed the sea monsters. ''[a bubble giraffe lowers his neck]'' Ooh! Alley-zoop! ''[laughs as the bubble giraffe carries him over to the sea monster enclosure; he blows a bubble rotisserie chicken]'' Come and get it!}}
{{L|''[A bubble piranha jump up and eats the bubble chicken. Then Patrick jumps up and eats the bubble piranha. Then the bubble sea monster pops out, eats Patrick, and swallows him.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hi! ''[swims inside the bubble sea monster]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob looks nervously at the audience. But instead of being scared, the audience loves it. Meanwhile, Squidward wakes up from his nap.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[yawns]'' ♪Oh, up from my nap, ''[hums as he goes to the closet]'' getting my garden pants, ''[comes out with garden clothes and a hoe]'' going out the door, ''[exits his house]'' walking on the tongue, ''[continues walking]'' that's a lot of teeth.♪ ''[hums as he ends up getting swallowed by the bubble sea monster; he screams]'' What's happening?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Squidward! I see you're playing with my sea monsters. Isn't my bubble zoo fun?}}
{{L|Squidward|Get me out of here, you moron!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay. ''[the bubble giraffe sets him down]'' Oh, Maggie. ''[tickles the bubble sea monster]'' Tickle, tickle. Let's put Squidward down. ''[the bubble giggles and lays a bubble egg with Squidward cramped up in it]'' Wow! Aww!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[grunts as he struggles to break free and pops out of the bubble egg]'' Blech!}}
{{L|Patrick|And Squidward is reborn!}}
{{L|''[The audience cheers.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Now, wait just a darn second, I- ''[before he can rant, a bubble goat appears and eats his clothes; he sees himself with no clothes on and freaks out; he runs over to the bubble rhino enclosure and gets his nose caught in its horn]'' Uh-oh.}}
{{L|''[Squidward unintentionally provokes the bubble rhino and it starts going on a rampage.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Look out, Squidward!}}
{{L|''[The bubble rhino stampedes through the bubble zoo and destroys the bubble ticket stand. It then destroys the bubble zoo sign and almost all of the bubble zoo itself, setting all of the bubble zoo animals free. The customers run off in panic.]''}}
{{L|Fred|Run for your lives!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, don't forget to bring it back! ''[the bubble zoo animals growl at him]'' Nice bubble beasts. Uh, let's make you some more enclosures, huh? ''[the bubble zoo animals trample over SpongeBob and go to wreck havoc in Bikini Bottom]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Would now be a good time to talk about my hours?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[injured and dazed]'' Stop those animals, Patrick! Go!}}
{{L|Patrick|Huh? Oh! ''[runs over to the bubble zoo animals and hops onto the bubble elephant's back; he takes the trunk and forms it into a hammer]'' Stop animules! ''[starts hammering some of the bubble animals]'' Stop, stop, stop! ''[the bubble elephant pulls back its trunk]'' Huh? ''[the bubble elephant hammers Patrick off its back and sends him flying back to SpongeBob]'' But seriously, SpongeBob. Thursdays are out.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to the bubble zoo animals entering the Krusty Krab. The customers run out in panic as the bubble animals begin causing a mayhem in the restaurant.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[grabs the cash register and quivers in fear]'' Take me customers! Just don't hurt me money! ''[hops onto his cash register and rockets himself out of the restaurant]''}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket being invaded by bubble penguins. Plankton and Karen climb higher to avoid the bubble penguins.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|For hate's sake! I spit my last breath at thee! ''[spits at the bubble penguin, but it only makes it bigger; he screams and climbs up onto Karen's monitor]''}}
{{L|Karen|Don't be so dramatic. They're cute. ''[bubble penguins begin flooding the Chum Bucket]'' Wait! Wait! ''[screams alongside with Plankton as they are being surrounded by the bubble penguins]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick are being cornered by the bubble zoo animals.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh, SpongeBob, why are the animals making scary faces?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|They've gone wild, Patrick! Wild!}}
{{L|''[Patrick screams in terror. He opens SpongeBob's body, removes his brain and hides inside him. SpongeBob unleashes a really loud Tarzan yell. The yell was so super loud that the wild animals from the Bikini Bottom Zoo heard it.]''}}
{{L|Zookeeper|''[hums until he sees the animals out of their enclosures]'' Hey! This ain't no inferno! Get back in your enclosures right now!}}
{{L|''[The zoo animals refuse to listen to the zookeeper and they trample on top of him to go save SpongeBob, which is considered as the zookeeper's punishment for banning SpongeBob from the zoo in the first place.]''}}
{{L|Zookeeper|''[dazed]'' Or whenever you know I'm flexible. ''[passes out]''}}
{{L|''[The zoo animals arrive at SpongeBob's house just in time before the bubble animals begin their assault.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, it's the zoo animals!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|They must've heard my uvula!}}
{{L|''[Patrick climbs out of SpongeBob's mouth. The zoo animals and the bubble animals growl at each other as they are about to go at war. Just then, the sea monster from the zoo appears and lets out a mighty roar. The terrified bubble animals fearfully retreat back into the extra strength bubble soap, leaving the bubble giraffe's head floating until it pops.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You guys saved our lives!}}
{{L|Patrick|Thank you, animules!}}
{{L|''[The zoo animals cuddle and lick SpongeBob and Patrick out of affection. The scene changes back to the Bikini Bottom Zoo. It seems that the zookeeper appeared to have apologized to SpongeBob for selfishly banning him from the zoo earlier and is now on good terms with him.]''}}
{{L|Zookeeper|And thank you, SpongeBob, for bringing my animals back. And I just love the new animals too. ''[points to the bubble animals being with the zoo animals in their enclosures]'' You are welcome at the zoo anytime. I officially remove the ban. ''[removes the ankle alarm from SpongeBob's leg]'' There you go.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I promise you won't regret it, Mr. Zookeeper, sir. ''[yells like Tarzan and grabs a vine]'' I'm free again! ''[swings on the vine]'' Weee!! ''[swings by Squidward, who is still hanging on the bubble rhino's horn with his nose]'' Good morning, Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|Good morning. ''[sighs]'' It's a living.}}
