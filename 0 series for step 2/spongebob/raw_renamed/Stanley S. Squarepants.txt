{{L|''[Episode begins at SpongeBob’s House. SpongeBob opens his front door and sees a package on the ground]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, somebody left me a package! ''[straining and grunting while carrying the package inside]'' Heavy! I wonder what's inside. ''[opens the package]''}}
{{L|Stanley|Hello.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams]''}}
{{L|Stanley|Phew! Cramped in there.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Cousin Stanley!}}
{{L|Stanley|Cousin SpongeBob! ''[both shake their tongues]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So, what brings you to Bikini Bottom, Stanley?}}
{{L|Stanley|Uncle Sherm said I should come visit you. I have a note from him somewhere. Oh, right. It's in here. ''[pulls the note out of his head]'' Here it is.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[reading it]'' Dear SpongeBob. I'm sending your cousin Stanley to live with you. He can't hold down a job and he ruins everything he touches. I can't take it anymore. Maybe you can straighten him out. Love, Uncle Sherm. Well, you're always welcome here, Stanley! My pineapple is your pineapple.}}
{{L|Stanley|Wow! You've got your own refrigerator. I'm not allowed near the fridge at Uncle Sherm's. ''[accidentally throws out its contents]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh well, now I don't have to clean it out.}}
{{L|Stanley|''[off-screen]'' Yahahaahoo!}}
{{L|SpongeBob| ''[walks to the washroom and knocks on the door]'' Stanley! You okay in there, Stanley?}}
{{L|Stanley|Your toilet is so cool! Is that what I think it is? ''[runs to the TV, the toilet starts overflowing, SpongeBob opens the door. Water rushes out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, it was bath night.}}
{{L|''[Stanley flips through the channels on the TV]''}}
{{L|Stanley|Gee... Whee...}}
{{L|Announcer|Only $29.99!}}
{{L|Squirrel|You'll never take me alive, flat foot!}}
{{L|TV speaker|A flaky scalp.}}
{{L|Stanley|Uncle Sherm never let me watch TV at home.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why not? ''[an explosion happens]''}}
{{L|Stanley|That's why... What's that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, that's okay. There's nothing good on TV anyway. ''[He is now clearly annoyed]'' Nothing...}}
{{L|Stanley|''[looking at a picture of SpongeBob in front of the Krusty Krab]'' You work at the Krusty Krab!?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't just work there! I'm vice assistant general manager in charge of certain things. That's me turning the front door key! That's me serving a customer! And that's me performing sanitary maintenance!}}
{{L|Stanley|Oh! Who's that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, that. That's me making Krabby Patties! The best job in the world. It's my calling.}}
{{L|Stanley|I wish I had a calling.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Stanley. You just haven't found your purpose in life, that's all!}}
{{L|Stanley|You really think so?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I know so. I bet my friend Squidward can help you! ''[outside]'' Hi, Squidward. I'd like you to meet my cousin, Stanley.}}
{{L|Stanley|We're related.}}
{{L|Squidward|There's two of them?! ''[screams and gets all his things, and puts a "For Sale" sign next to his house]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Step on it! ''[drives off]''}}
{{L|Stanley|Your friend Squidward seems busy.}}
<font color="red">{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, it's okay. I'm sure my friend Sandy can think of something. She's a scientist! ''[cuts to the treedome]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Hey, SpongeBob. Who's your friend?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This is my cousin, Stanley SquarePants. I thought you could teach him how to be a scientist.}}
{{L|Sandy|Why, sure! Glad to meet you, partner.}}
{{L|Stanley|Nice to meet you too, Sa... ''[Stanley trips on a rock in slow motion ]'' Whoa! ''[his buck teeth rip a hole in Sandy's air suit]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Uh oh. ''[zooms up]'' Y’all... darn it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Err... Maybe you're not scientist material. But don't you worry. I bet Patrick can help you! He's a genius!</font> ''[at Patrick's house]'' And so, Mr. Star, that's why we came to you.}}
{{L|Patrick|Looking for your calling, huh? ''[examines Stanley]'' Hmmm... So, what are you good at?}}
{{L|Stanley|Nothing.}}
{{L|Patrick|Nothing at all?}}
{{L|Stanley|Yep.}}
{{L|Patrick|Interesting. Let's see how good you are at nothing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's perfect! Patrick can do nothing better than anyone! ''[whispers in Stanley's ear]'' You'll be learning from the master!}}
{{L|Patrick|Come with me. First, sit down on this chair. Clear your mind. Empty it off all thoughts... until you're doing... absolutely... nothing. ''[does nothing]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|See? Isn't he amazing?}}
{{L|Stanley|Clear my mind. Do nothing. ''[focuses on Stanley's difficulty to do nothing, but taps his foot, twitches, looks at the clock and Patrick, and mutters until he panically shouts]'' I can't do it!}}
{{L|Patrick|You're not worthy for instruction in the immobile arts. Leave my presence!}}
{{L|Stanley|Couldn't I try...}}
{{L|Patrick|Too bad! Not a word!}}
{{L|Stanley|I can't even do nothing right.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry! We just have to keep on looking! ''[looks at his watch and takes out his Krusty Krab hat]'' Oh, gentle hat, symbol of employment! Cornerstone of my eternal happiness! I don thee now, in preparation, for this workday. ''[kisses it and puts it on]'' Wooo! You have no idea how this feels.}}
{{L|Stanley|No! ''[starts to cry]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, what's wrong, Stanley? You're not still upset about that whole never accomplished anything in your life thing, are you?}}
{{L|Stanley|No.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good, then why don't you come with me to work. Maybe seeing me totally fulfilled with cheer you up.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|There's me little money maker! ''[kisses SpongeBob]'' Are you gonna make me lots of money today?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, sir!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ah, what I give if only there are two of what? One, two? There's two?! He looks like you. He smells like you. He tastes like you! Is he a hard worker, just like you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um... Uh...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, is he?}}
{{L|Stanley|''[saying "please" 9 times]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, sir.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[money comes out of his pants]'' You've got the job!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[at the cash register with Stanley]'' Your job is to take people's money, and put it in here! ''[points to register]''}}
{{L|Stanley|Ooh! Can I touch it? ''[register explodes]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[in office]'' Money? ''[sniffs]'' Burning?! ''[jumps out of office and onto money, gets covered with tar and sobs]'' SpongeBob!? Who's responsible for this!?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I... guess I am, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You're on probation, boy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[at the kitchen]'' Well, Stanley. Thanks to you, I'm on probation. If you wanna keep this job, you're gonna have to... ''[customer comes in]'' Woo! Customer at the port bow! Man your stations! Man your stations! ''[does push-ups]'' Ready for duty!}}
{{L|Stanley|My first customer. Hi, I'm Stanley! Ohhh! This is so exciting!}}
{{L|Harold|Hmm... I'd like a...}}
{{L|Stanley|Wait, wait, wait, wait! ''[grabs camera]'' Hold on. ''[places camera]'' I don't want to ever forget this moment! ''[come next to Harold and snaps a picture]'' That's gonna be a keeper. Now let's do one with funny hats! ''[snaps pictures of them wearing sombreros, scuba diving outfits, and wedding outfits. Harold starts getting angry]'' Ooh! Let's pretend we're mad at each other! ''[snaps picture]'' ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Harold|''[explodes]''}}
{{L|Stanley|I can't wait to get these developed. ''[Stanley abandons long line of customers, who are impatiently waiting for their order]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I said I'm ready, Stanley. ''[commotion]'' Whoa! ''[SpongeBob rushes to the cash register and starts taking and making the orders as fast as he can, soon everyone in the restaurant burps making the Krusty Krab float and shake, everyone is satisfied and leaves the restaurant, Mr. Krabs burst in to see what's going on]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! What's the meaning of this? Your station looks horrible. Take some pride in your work, boy! Look at your cousin, Stanley, for example. Spiffing up his workplace with meaningful photos of the customers! ''[looks at wedding picture]''}}
<font color="red">{{L|SpongeBob|''[goes into office]'' Um... sir?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes, boy?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|About my cousin, Stanley?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes, yes. The one I hired entirely on your recommendation. Hurry up, boy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|About what I said...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What? You didn't lie to me just so your cousin could get the job, did ya?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, good. Because there are plenty of other relatives that got passed over for the job!}}
{{L|Sandy's Cousin|''[Scottish accent]'' Aye, 'tis true!}}
{{L|Squidward's Cousin|Whatever. ''[Squidward's Cousin walks away]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I even turned down my three adorable nephews.}}
{{L|Nephews|''[in unison]'' But, Uncle Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|They solve mysteries. ''[laughs]'' Now go solve the mystery of why you didn't get the job!}}
{{L|Nephews|''[They walk away in annoyance]''}}</font>
{{L|SpongeBob|Stanley, I cannot keep covering for you...! ''[SpongeBob screams in shock and sees that Stanley has bent SpongeBob's spatula]'' No! Not my spatula! My spatula... ''[sniffs]'' The thing I hold nearest and dearest to my heart...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, what in the name of Neptune is going...? Oh. You broke your spatula. That's a shame. I'll order another one tomorrow, boy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Screaming]'' No! No! No! I didn't break my spatula. He did! And I also didn't burn your money. He did that, too! I have been covering for him because he can't do anything right! ''[breathes heavily]''}}
{{L|Stanley|He's right! I ruin everything I touch! ''[runs off crying]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wait a minute... I know the perfect job for you! ''[bubble transition]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[next day]'' Good luck on your new job, cousin Stanley!}}
{{L|Stanley|Thanks! I bet I'll be even better in this one!}}
{{L|Plankton|Good morning, Mr. SquarePants!}}
{{L|Stanley|Morning, boss.}}
{{L|Plankton|I can't believe it! That fool Krabs letting the blood relative of his best worker! ''[big explosion as Mr. Krabs watches through windows]'' Well, that's the end of me.}}
{{L|Stanley|Sorry, boss.}}
