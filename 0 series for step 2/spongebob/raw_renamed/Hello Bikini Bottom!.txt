{{L|SpongeBob|Kind of sounds like Squidward's practicing his clarinet over there. Doesn't it, Gary? Gary? Well, I can't just stand by and let him practice alone. Then what kind of a friend and neighbor would I be? Not that kind that I... ''[metal tinges and takes out guitar]''...would want.}}
{{L|''[Squidward continues playing his clarinet until SpongeBob opens his window and he starts to play along. Squidward stops playing his clarinet after noticing SpongeBob]''}}

{{L|''[The bus stops at the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs comes out of it and enters the Krusty Krab]''}}

{{L|Patrick|''[Enters holding a boat]'' Somebody left this thing laying around the parking lot.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Roadie! Check!}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to the Ned and the Needlefish concert with Mr. Krabs driving to the outside of it]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Here we are, boys! Our first gig! All those people are lined up to see you!}}
{{L|Squidward|Sounds like a load of hooey...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Alright, roadie, start unloading the hooey! ''[Walks off the bus with Patrick]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Holding the speaker]'' Uh, Mr. Krabs? Where do I put this?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Writing on clipboard]'' Anywhere is fine.}}
{{L|Patrick|Then what about this? ''[Still holding the same speaker]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey! Look! It's Ned and the Needlefish!}}
{{L|''[Ned and the Needlefish walk off their bus with the crowd cheering for them and they enter the building]''}}
{{L|Colonel Carper|Well, well, well! If it isn't that guy that stole my band! I hope you all aren't here to steal THIS band, too! Because THIS time around, I'll be ready for ya!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, that's very interesting, Colonel Carper! But right now, my band and I are on a world tour! And tonight, we're opening for Ned and the Needlefish!}}
{{L|Colonel Carper|''[Laughs heavily]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah...eh, what's so funny!?}}
{{L|Colonel Carper|You are! And the fact that you think you have any idea what it takes to put on a musical tour!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|We have a tour bus, sound equipment, a roadie!}}
{{L|Colonel Carper|You call that a tour bus? ''[Walks over to Patrick who is still holding the same speaker]'' You call this sound equipment? That's not a roadie, these are roadies! ''[Points over to two very large and muscular fish standing beside Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ahhhh!}}
{{L|Colonel Carper|I'll tell you what, I'll let you open for Ned and the Needlefish on one condition: My roadies get to sabotage your sound equipment and have it blow up during your sound check!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wait a minute...what's that gonna cost me?}}
{{L|Colonel Carper|Oh, that will be free!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Shakes Carper's fin]'' Deal!}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to a stage]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Okay, Mr. Squidward. Take it from the top! ''[Squidward plays a note but the speaker overhead instanly explodes]'' Doggonit...}}
{{L|Colonel Carper|Hah hah hah! Now you don't have any sound equipment! Unlike me, who has this entire wall of speakers you see right behind me! Hah hah hah! Now your whole tour is ruined! Hah hah hah hah! ''[Doesn't notice Mr. Krabs pushing away his wall of speakers behind him]'' Seriously! I can't! I can't take it! It's too much! ''[Falls on the ground laughing.

{{L|SpongeBob|It sure was nice of that Colonel Carper guy to let us borrow his entire wall of sound equipment! Wasn't it Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, here we are! Our next gig! ''[Stops at a Supermarket]''}}
{{L|Squidward|We're performing at a supermarket? Driver, turn this bus around! The tour is canceled! Head straight back to the Krusty Krab!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Sorry, Squidward, but that is physically impossible!}}
{{L|Squidward|What!?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Because it's not there anymore!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The Krusty Krab's not there anymore!? Where'd it go?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I pawned it! To raise the cash for the concert tour!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Ears explode]'' You did what?!!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah...hard to believe, I know! My heard aches when I think of me old girl cold and lonely. Just sitting in the front window of that dirty pawn shop at the mercy of any random joe who just happens to pass on by.}}

{{L|Plankton|''[Whistling]'' Gasp! ''[Notices the Krusty Krab in the Pawn Shop's window]'' Hopping Hamburger Stands! I gotta go home and get my wallet!}}
{{L|''[Scene changes back to the tour bus]''}}
{{L|Squidward|It's not even my restaurant and somehow I regret that decision...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey! Now quit your worrying back there! With the success we're about to have, we'll be able to buy ten Krusty Krabs!}}

{{L|Elderly Fish|Too loud! You're playing too loud!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Quietly]'' Sorry, sir.}}

{{L|''[Scene changes back to the tour bus]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Supermarket openings, retirement homes! What's next a child's birthday party! ''[They arrive at a child's birthday party and they get off the bus]'' This is our worse gig yet: Children parties! Well, if this is the way this tour is being organized, then I would like to... Owww! ''[Notices a kid stuck in behind with a pin used for Pin the tail on the donkey]'' I am not a donkey-fish!}}
{{L|''[Cue commercial. Comes back from commercial with it opening with Mr. Krabs' tour bus. SpongeBob and Patrick are resting on Squidward]''}}

{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Reading a map]'' Uh... not too much farther, Squidward! Uh...oh, in fact, we're just entering it now! ''[Turns on a sign that literally says "Next Town"]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, if this concert is anywhere near terrible as the other ones, then it's gonna be my last! ''[Notices Mr. Krabs parking at run down place called Electronics Outhouse]'' What the... Electronics Outhouse!? Goodbye! ''[Tires to leave off bus but Mr. Krabs quickly closes it on his face]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|This ain't our next concert!}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, then, where is it!?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It's uh... uh... um... ''[He, Squidward, and SpongeBob notice a crowd heading toward a stadium]'' Well, it's right over there obviously! ''[Drives to the stadium that says "Ned and the Needlefish Today" on it and they get off the bus]'' I'll just leave the three of you right here to set up! I got some important tour management business to attend to, you know!}}
{{L|Squidward|Hold it! This better not be one of your tricks, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs closes the door on Squidward and drives back to the "Next Town" sign and hammers something to it then drives off. Ned and the Needlefish then drives up to the sign]''}}
{{L|Band Member 1|Hey, look, man! ''[Notices the sign that now shows their name]'' "Ned and the Needlefish, Next Turn."}}
{{L|Ned|Whoa... it's like a sign from.... a sign, man. ''[Stops driving at the Electronics Outhouse]'' Wow... we have really moved down in the world.}}
{{L|''[Scene changes back to the stadium where SpongeBob and Squidward are at]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Isn't this the most exciting experience in your entire life, Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah. I've never thought I get to perform for so many fans!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh? Are there people showing up?}}
{{L|Squidward|Isn't that... what you we’re talking about? ''[The stage opens up and he smiles and he hears the crowd cheering]'' Ah, just soak on in, Squiddy, old boy! Pretty invigorating, isn't it? Wait a minute... why are they chanting "Ned and the Needlefish?"}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, can't you hear them, Squidward? They're saying “Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward...” ''[Notices the lights turn on and the crowd stop chanting]''}}
{{L|Harold|That does not look like Ned and the Needlefish! ''[He along with the crowd start booing]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Wait! I know what you came here for! ''[Starts to play on his clarinet with SpongeBob playing along with his guitar]'' Well?}}

{{L|Patrick|Wow... you're good at guessing...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, why didn't you just ask me? ''[Takes out a small plastic bag with very small tires in it]'' You know I always bring tiny, snack size tires for in-between meals. You know, I'm kinda hungry now actually. ''[Eats one of the tires]'' Hmm... Squidward? They're fat free.}}
