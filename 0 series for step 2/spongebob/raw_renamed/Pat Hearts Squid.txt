{{L|''[A crablike creature is walking along the ground, and a giant mud monster arises from the ground and scares it away.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Be quiet down there or I'm calling the cops!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[break out of the mud monster]'' What?!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sighs]'' I said... ''[screaming loudly]'' be quiet, ''[puts his head out the window]'' or I'm calling the ''[he loses balance, and he falls along with his entire house. The house then crumbles into pieces.]'' My house! My shelter! My life!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[putting their hands on Squidward's shoulders]'' My my my... ''[Squidward releases their arms]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So, who you gonna stay with until you find a new house, Squidward? Me, or Patrick?}}
{{L|Squidward|I wouldn't stay with either of you two idiots if the entire ocean was on fire and you were the only ones with water.}}
{{L|Patrick|So there's a chance!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[frustrated, he pretends to open the nonexistent door to his house and slams it, making him fall to the ground]''}}
{{L|''[bubble transitions to a shot of Conch Street, where Squidward's house is now a tent. Squidward gargles in his mouth while in a sleeping bag and spits into a bucket.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Ah, roughin' it ain't so rough. ''[he turns off a lantern and goes to sleep]''}}
{{L|The wind carries the tent into the air along with Squidward's nightcap, and he wakes up. It then starts raining.}}
{{L|Squidward|Too rough! ''[he flips a coin]'' Oh... I guess it's Patrick. ''[he zips himself up into the sleeping bag and inches towards Patrick's rock.]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Zee next morning...}}
{{L|Patrick|''[wakes up and stretches] [talks like Squidward]'' Well, Patrick, time for another lovely day in the flower garden of life. ''[gets up, and notices that his home is now a mess]''}}

{{L|Patrick|''[takes the brick off Squidward's face]'' Squidward, you kelp head,  what did you do to my beautiful house?!}}
{{L|Squidward|Define do. ''[shoves a Squidward-like Patrick figurine up his nose]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[screams] [takes the figurine off Squidward's nose, revealing Squidward's brain on top]'' Don't put my art up your nose, you cretin!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[takes back his brain on top of the figurine with his tongue and eats it]'' I might need that someday. Duh!}}
{{L|Patrick|Ugh... ''[he puts the figurine on a sand table]'' I'll play the old licorice stick. That always soothes my nerves. ''[he opens a clarinet case to see that his clarinet is missing, and gasps]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[eats the clarinet]'' Doesn't taste like licorice.}}
{{L|Patrick|My clarinet! Noo!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[spits out clarinet bits]'' Oh, sorry. You want some?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[slaps the clarinet bits out of Squidward's hand with a wooden spoon]'' Ah-ah-ah. The etiquette spoon came back and he says, 'Eat like a gentleman.'}}
{{L|Squidward|''[eats one of the clarinet valves in a "gentlemanly" manner he learned previously] [hears SpongeBob laughing off-screen]'' Umm...ummm...I 'm going to go play with my best friend SpongeBob. ''[laughs like Patrick and runs out]''}}{{L|Patrick|Yeah, you do that. Well I'll take a Pat-nap. ''[walks to his couch, lays down, and sleeps. Suddenly, he hears laughing coming from SpongeBob and Squidward]'' What are those ninnies up to now?! ''[Outside of Patrick's house, SpongeBob and Squidward appear to play in a mud puddle, with SpongeBob blowing a mud bubble.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' I told you would make a great Patrick, Squidward! ''[Squidward laughs]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[opens his window]'' Pipe down, you two!}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey Patrick, hands up! ''[holds a piece of mud and throws it at Patrick's face]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Squidward|Bullseye! ''[both laugh]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I said, be quiet, you two, or I'm calling the- ''[a piece of mud is thrown at Patrick's mouth and swallows it] [in normal voice]'' Mud... puddle! ''[Patrick makes noises as he transforms himself back into his original-self]'' Hi-huh! ''[He jumps into a mud puddle and splashes the screen]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[spits out mud]'' ''[in normal voice]'' He's Patrick again! Finally!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Squidward, look! ''[A helicopter carrying Squidward's new house appears, Squidward transforms back into his original-self, without his pants]''}}
{{L|Squidward|It's the new house I ordered! No more Patrick! ''[The helicopter drops Squidward's house on the ground]''}}
