{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|French Narrator|Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life. ''[chuckles]'' Well, you know. ''[Patrick is sleeping and the mailfish walks by and puts a box in his open mouth as he is yawning and waking up, he grabs it and quickly opens it, and it turns out to be a shiny, gold trophy]''}}
{{L|Patrick|An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award. ''[antenna on top of rock breaks]'' Jellyfish, I got an award. ''[jellyfish zap him and he jumps up above the surface]'' Island, I got an awar... ''[chokes for air and floats back down]'' I gotta show SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[building a house of cards looking like Gary]'' Hold still, Gary.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Almost done. ''[Patrick smashes through the wall and cards fall on the floor; Gary flies away]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award. ''[SpongeBob falls down to the floor]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[muffled]'' That's great, Patrick. What's it for?}}
{{L|Patrick|See for yourself.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[his body is facedown, but his face come out and reads the award]'' "For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants"?}}
{{L|Patrick|"SpongeBob SquarePants"? That's a funny way to spell my name.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.}}
{{L|Patrick|But, it's shiny. ''[SpongeBob takes the trophy]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?}}
{{L|Patrick|Ice cream!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Exactly!}}
{{L|Patrick|I can find it. Is it in here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, don't! That's my... ''[Patrick opens the door and a bunch of awards pile out of SpongeBob's closet]'' ...award closet.}}
{{L|Patrick|I want an award! ''[starts to cry]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[has two 1st place ribbons in his eyes]'' Aww, Patrick, don't cry. ''[Patrick starts sobbing loudly and wildly going away from the awards]'' You'll get an award one day.}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But you're Patrick... ''[jumps on Patrick and his eyes turn into stars]'' ''Star''. You can do anything you want.}}
{{L|Patrick|That's easy for you to say. You're Sponge''Bob''.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?}}
{{L|Patrick|I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Smaller. ''[shrinks]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Doctor?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Smaller. ''[shrinks more]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Fireman?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in a tiny voice]'' The smallest you can think of. ''[shrinks even more]''}}
{{L|Patrick|A job at the Krusty Krab?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[normal voice]'' Yeah! ''[reverts to normal size]'' I do things at work all the time.}}
{{L|Patrick|Then let's go. ''[runs off, pulling off SpongeBob's arm]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?}}
{{L|Squidward|Guess who just quit? ''[puts his hat on Patrick's head and then leaves]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Do I get my award yet?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You have to work for it, remember?}}
{{L|Patrick|Tartar sauce. ''[SpongeBob flipping patties]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[places the order in the window]'' Pick up order! ''[Patrick comes and eats the order]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Do I get my award now?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, you have to take the tray to the customer.}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay. ''[his tray gets to the table but with no food; burps]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table. ''[Patrick arrives with food on tray but then eats it as he sits down]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Like that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nope.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[spits out food in the customerâ€™s face and forehead palms as he frustratingly yells]'' Barnacles!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's try something different.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|All you have to do is answer the phone.}}
{{L|Patrick|Aye aye, Captain! ''[the phone rings]''}}
{{L|Man on Phone|Is this the Krusty Krab?}}
{{L|Patrick|No, this is Patrick. ''[hangs up and starts whistling; the phone rings again]''}}
{{L|Woman on Phone|Is this the Krusty Krab?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[annoyed]'' No, this is Patrick. ''[hangs up and continues to whistle; the phone rings yet again]''}}
{{L|Another Man on Phone|Is this the Krusty Krab?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[yelling angrily]'' No! This is Patrick! ''[puts the phone down and folds his arms]'' I'm not a Krusty Krab.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.}}
{{L|Patrick|Huh? Oh... Fishpaste!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out? ''[hands Patrick a broom]''}}
{{L|Patrick|What's the point? I can't do anything right.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You'll do fine. ''[Patrick sweeps with the handle side of the broom instead of the head]''}}
{{L|Nat|''[approaches Patrick]'' Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown? ''[continues drinking]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Keep trying, Patrick.}}
{{L|Delivery Guy|I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants. ''[Patrick becomes furious and sweeps harder]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[steams up]'' Why can't I do anything right?! ''[sweeps harder in frustration then bangs the head of the broom on the floor making dust rise all over the Krusty Krab's dining area, which makes the nearby customers cough]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pushing Patrick]'' Kitchen...! }}
{{L|Patrick|''[throws the broom to the floor]'' I'm never gonna get an award, now.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar. ''[gets a jar and opens the lid]'' Easy. Now you try. First get a jar. ''[Patrick gets out a pickle]'' Patrick, that's a pickle.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You need a jar. ''[Patrick picks up a spatula]'' No. ''[Patrick takes his pants off]'' No. ''[Patrick picks up SpongeBob]'' No. Try... this! ''[gives Patrick a jar]'' Now take the lid off the jar. ''[Patrick puts the lid in his mouth]'' Just relax. Lift your hand. ''[Patrick lifts his hand]'' Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. ''[Patrick puts his hand on counter]'' No, the lid. ''[Patrick slides his hand to the corner of the counter]'' ''[Patrick tries for the lid over and over as SpongeBob keeps telling him "the lid", Patrick pants due to exhaustion; few seconds later, Patrick is almost there]'' Freeze! ''[Patrick's hand is on the side of the jar]'' Almost there. Now head for the lid. ''[his hand goes lower]'' Cold. ''[his hand goes higher]'' Warmer. ''[his hand goes higher]'' Warmer. ''[his hand goes higher]'' Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!}}
{{L|Patrick|Aagh, it burns!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do. ''[takes it off again]'' Exactly as I do. ''[takes it off again]'' Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.}}
{{L|Patrick|Exactly as you do. ''[takes lid off jar, then starts to cry]'' Oh, no, I broke it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, no, Patrick, you did it!}}
{{L|Patrick|I did? ''[both cheer as Patrick slams the jar into the floor]'' Touchdown! I'm jarmaster!  }}
{{L|SpongeBob|That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah. Remember when I had my hand up? And I put it on the lid?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, yeah.}}
{{L|Patrick|Then I took the lid off and I thought I broke it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Yeah.}}
{{L|Patrick|But I didn't. I opened the jar with my hand. And it was all because you showed me how to do it. I'm never gonna forget this.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, you do exactly what I do and you'll have an award in no time. ''[night becomes day in SpongeBob's house. A clam crows like a rooster]'' I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. ''[notices Patrick dressed up like him]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Good morning, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow. It's amazing how a simple change of clothes can make a guy look...just...like...me.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yup. If I'm gonna be an award winner, I've gotta dress like one.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... ''[Patrick copies SpongeBob, who then stops]'' Huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, back to the ol' grind.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, back to the ol' grind.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Forgot my hat.}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh, me, too. ''[SpongeBob mops the floor then puts the mop up; Patrick mops the floor but he makes the floor wet; SpongeBob comes out with a handful of plates and slips and breaks them all; Patrick follows in SpongeBob's footsteps; SpongeBob glares at him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[at the grill, frying patties, both whistle a tune, then stop, they both wipe their foreheads]'' Whew! ''[SpongeBob drops his spatula]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Dropped my spatula. ''[bends down to pick it up]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Uhh, me, too. ''[drops his spatula and bends down to pick it up; SpongeBob takes off his hat, then Patrick takes off his, they both put their hats back on, then they both put their hands on the grill; Patrick's hand burns after a few seconds]'' Ow!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aha! ''[shows the fake hand]'' You're copying me!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why are you doing that?}}
{{L|Patrick|So I can win an award like you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, it's annoying, so stop it!}}
{{L|Patrick|Stop it. ''[both imitate the others facial expressions]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Say, you're good.}}
{{L|Patrick|Thanks.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Ha! Darn. ''[both look at each other with suspicion, while rubbing their chins. They later watch each other as they dance to ''Mary had a Little Lamb'']'' Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as... pickle fish lips! ''[both cover their mouths]'' Seaweavel. ''[both cover their mouths again]''  Yorgyshmorgies. ''[both cover their mouths yet again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in his head]'' At least I'm safe inside my mind. ''[realized that he wasn't safe in his mind]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[in his head]'' At least I'm safe inside my mind.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[screaming]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[he and Patrick run out of the Krusty Krab]'' Stop copying me!}}
{{L|Patrick|There's no award for that!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[leaning against the Krusty Krab sign pole, reading a newspaper, a Krusty Krab hat falls near him]'' Well, I guess it's safe to go in now. ''[puts his hat back on and walks back in]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[he and Patrick are still running]'' Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?}}
{{L|Patrick|Until I have as many awards as you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We'll see about that!}}
{{L|Patrick|No, we won't.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[takes out a jump-rope]'' I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.}}
{{L|Patrick|Me, too. ''[takes out a jump-rope]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice. ''[crosses his arms and jump-ropes while Patrick tries to imitate but ties himself up with his rope]'' Ha! Not a scratch on me. ''[his body breaks down into pieces, which later hop away]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, no, you don't! ''[squeezes the rope on himself breaking his body down into smaller pieces, then both hit a hammer on their heads]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Are you kidding? I used to do this ''way'' before I started copying you. ''[SpongeBob stops hammering his head but Patrick does not notice; Patrick hits himself faster and too hard, he stops and gets dizzy...]'' Wheeeee... ''[...as trophies appear and spin around his head. He falls on the ground; SpongeBob runs into Patrick's rock painted as SpongeBob's house; SpongeBob gets angry and steam comes out of his head]''}}
{{L|Patrick|My turn! ''[runs into the pineapple rock]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[runs into his house]'' I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me. ''[pushes his nose into his face and comes out of his house dressed in Patrick's normal outfit]'' Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Patrick|What's so great about being a big pink loser? ''[SpongeBob's nose pops back out]'' Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But, Patrick...}}
{{L|Patrick|Patrick's not here!}}
{{L|Delivery Guy|''[stops in front of SpongeBob and Patrick in truck]'' Trophy delivery! ''[drives off and SpongeBob has a package in his mouth]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Another trophy?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[sarcastically]'' Oh, great! ''[SpongeBob opens the package]'' What's it for THIS time?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|"For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else: Patrick"! This trophy's for you!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yay! ''[puts his trophy on his head like a hat]'' Eeeh! ''[both rip off their present outfits to reveal their own normal outfits]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So, what are you gonna do, now?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm gonna go protect my title. ''[jumps on his rock and falls asleep, the rock closes]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|So you thought I was kidding, huh? No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock.}}
