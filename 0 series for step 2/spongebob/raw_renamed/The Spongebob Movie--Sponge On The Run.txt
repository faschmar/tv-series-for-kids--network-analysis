{{L|SpongeBob|I'm ready! (Not heard in other Nickelodeon movies and not heard in International versions of the film)}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob struggles to pull down the lever, until finally it breaks free and the camera then follows what looks to be electric green slime going through a tube until finally reaching the "N" on the Nickelodeon logo and thus powering on the entire logo. The walls fall down opening up to a beautiful sunset with palm trees on each side and with electric green slime tubes coming down from the first and last "N" on the Nickelodeon Logo. The Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards blimp comes by spitting out the word "Movies" right underneath the Nickelodeon logo. As the Blimp comes into shot, a fanfare plays the Nickelodeon jingle with SpongeBob singing along.]''}}

{{L|''[Gary then climbs all over SpongeBob in an attempt to wake him up, leaving slime all over SpongeBob's face which gets slightly distorted; his eyes are sideways and his nose is on his forehead.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! uh... G'morning, Gary!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob then rubs some slime off his face, thus shifting it back to normal. The shot transitions to SpongeBob's hands with slime all over them and with Gary sitting right in front, looking directly at him.]''}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Come on, Gary, breakfast!}}
{{L|''[Gary burps.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're welcome!}}
{{L|''[Gary rolls over wanting his belly scratched.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Who wants a belly scratch!? ''[scratches Gary's belly]'' I love you so much, Gary!}}
{{L|Gary|Meow!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob holds one of Gary's toys and plays with him.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's this? ''[Gary eats the toy whole, leaving nothing behind.]'' Okay... that’ll come out later.}}
{{L|''[The movie's logo then splashes down under the sea with a dark blue sea background, then the scene transitions back to SpongeBob taking Gary out for a walk while [[It's Always Summer In Bikini Bottom]] continues to play.]''}}

{{L|Mr. Krabs|Money...money...money! [laughs]}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh! I'm late if I'm gonna be early! ''[dashes back onscreen putting his hat on.]''}}
{{L|Gary|[meows disappointingly]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob peers from the side of the door}''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh ho, don't worry Gare Bear. I'll be back before you can say, "Why did he cruelly abandon me like that?" [Laughs and leaves]}}

{{L|Squidward|[Sighs] Another day, another migraine...}}
{{L|''[It then shows Squidward grumpily walking to his register boat where there he sits down and reads a Kelpy G magazine]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, at least I'll get a little peace and quiet before that little...}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Good morning Squidward, and isn't it a lovely morning?}}
{{L|Squidward|Nope, not talking to you.}}
{{L|''[Squidward then goes back to trying to read his Kelpy G magazine]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm especially not getting involved in any of your nonsense today! I always end up with the wrong end of the stick!}}
{{L|''[The camera then cuts back to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ok, Squidward.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob then begins to walk back to the Kitchen.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|[Sighs]}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But you should know that Old Gertrude is getting pretty finicky these days.}}
{{L|Squidward|Old Gertrude? Who the kelp is that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You've worked with her for years! She's the 8-burner grill in the Kitchen.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob then goes into the kitchen]''}}
{{L|Squidward|[Angrily] It never ends...}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob then skips around the kitchen placing himself next to the grill]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Anyway, to fire her up, you've gotta spark the flames manually...}}
{{L|''[The grill then lets out a boom releasing the grill into midair for a brief second]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Then jiggle the gas jets just a little.}}
{{L|''[The scene then cuts to SpongeBob turning knobs behind the grill. It then it cuts to Squidward who is constantly flipping pages in his Kelpy G magazine looking very annoyed with SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And then read her favorite story.}}
{{L|''[The scene then cuts back into the kitchen with SpongeBob]''}}

{{L|''[The scene then cuts back to Squidward who is looking really fed up and annoyed with SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What did I just say? I am not interested! Don't involve me!}}
{{L|''[The grill then starts to flame then explodes into flames causing Squidward to catch on fire. He then turns around and falls over].''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whatcha say Squidward? Squidward?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob looks around for Squidward]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ok, Squidward doesn't matter. I'll always be here anyway.}}
{{L|''[The scene then pans down to Squidward who is face first on the ground]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Unfortunately.}}
{{L|''[The scene then pans up to Mr. Krabs leaving his office]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Stop yer loafin' Mr. Squidward, there's work do be done around here!}}
{{L|''[The camera then pans up to Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Attention Krusty Krew! All hands on deck, front and center!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob then quickly zips into frame while Squidward walks slowly into frame]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye, aye, Cap'n Krabs, sir!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now, who's ready to set sail on another adventure of making me money?}}
{{L|''[Squidward walks out of frame. Mr. Krabs then yells at SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Get movin' sailor!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sir yes sir!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob runs off.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Raise the colors!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob grabs a rope and swings up to the mast and back down to pull the five international maritime signal flags above the front door.]}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hoist the main sail!}}
{{L|''[Outside, SpongeBob pulls the rope from the large clam-shaped sign, opening it up to show its sign.]}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Deploy smokestacks!}}
{{L|''[Inside, Squidward flicks the lever on a nearby engine order telegraph with a pencil, setting it to FULL while reading his magazine. Outside, the smokestack rises up on the roof. Inside, in the kitchen, SpongeBob sniffs the grill while smoke form it comes up through the smokestack and spread over Bikini Bottom. Mr. Krabs then walks to the door, puts on the opening sign, and opens the doors, leading a herd of hungry customers to run over Krabs flat.]}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|[chuckles] Ahh... never gets old.}}
{{L|''[Outside, Plankton spies on the Krusty Krab from the Chum Bucket with a giant telescope.]}}
{{L|Plankton|''[cackles]'' Enjoy it while you can, Mr. Eugene Krabs.}}
{{L|''[Beeping]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What the...? ''[The telescope says "INSERT COIN"; growling]'' Stupid machine! ''[Inserts a coin]'' Where was I? Oh, yeah. [cackling]. Tonight I launch Evil Plan Number 3,087, and finally take possession of the Krabby Patty secret formula!}}
{{L|Karen|Great. Another evil plan.}}
{{L|Plankton|What's wrong with another evil plan?}}
{{L|Karen|Oh, nothing, it's just we're running out of room on The Wall of Failure.}}
{{L|Plankton|Wall of Fai--?}}
{{L|''[He sees a wall of framed pictures of his failed plans]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Karen, why do you keep collecting these?}}
{{L|Karen|Heh. Memories.}}
{{L|Plankton|Hmm! Well, tonight… is gonna be different. ''[Laughs]'' You see Karen, my computer wife, every time I've tried to steal that formula, Krabs has tried to thwart me.}}
{{L|Karen|Mm-mm, not Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Plankton|But tonight, that all...what?}}
{{L|Karen|It's not Mr. Krabs, sweetheart. I've checked the data. It's SpongeBob who's the problem.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|[on screen] Hello!}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, fishsticks. What could that boob have to do with it? Heh.}}
{{L|Karen|Boob savant, you mean. SpongeBob is the one who keeps foiling your plans.}}

{{L|Plankton|Oh nonsense, It's Krabs, Karen! I know it is. And tonight, I will finally, extract my revenge! [laughs evilly]}}
{{L|Karen|Will you be late?}}
{{L|Plankton|You can't put a clock on genius, Karen.}}
{{L|''[Back at the Krusty Krab.]}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Order up! Move it, let's go!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob then come out of the kitchen, to the order window.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye-aye, chef.}}

{{L|Sandy|Did you know in the future everything will be automated?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Really? Even stomachaces?}}
{{L|Sandy|''[Laughs]'' I'm gonna see if Mr. Krabs wants to be an early adopter of my new technology.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait what?! ''[jumps on the box, feeling scared]'' You're gonna replace me with a robot? Don't do it!}}
{{L|Sandy|No, Silly, that's gonna happen anyway. This is something much more innovative and start-uppy.}}
{{L|[The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs office]}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You have sixty seconds.}}

{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hmm. Automated? Sounds expensive, Not interested.}}
{{L|Sandy|Otto doesn't require a salary.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs stop walking, with his eyes turned around]''}}
{{L|Sandy|And it can make cold, heartless decisions like firing people because it doesn't have a heart.}}
{{L|[Sandy punch Otto]}}
{{L|Otto|Ow!}}

{{L|Plankton|In just a few minutes, the formula will be mine!}}
{{L|''[The bag says "Analyzing Formula", and "Analysis Complete" and it's printing the formula, waiting for it to complete. Plankton then snatched the formula and kicks his bag]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes! Krab's fast-food empire will fail, and I will rule Bikini Bottom, as it's new slop king! ''[Laughs loudly]''}}

{{L|Poseidon|Is that right?}}
{{L|Chancellor|Yeah.}}
{{L|''[Poseidon and Chancellor both chuckle and starts to laugh]''}}
{{L|Poseidon|Very good. Oh, Chancellor, when will you learn to focus on what really matters? A monarch's regime is only as powerful as his skin care regime.}}
{{L|''[Chancellor throws away his paycheck]''}}
{{L|Chancellor|Word. Mm-hm.}}
{{L|Poseidon|You know, some say I have a face like a Greek God.}}

{{L|Chancellor|Here you go, sire. Your royal snail.}}
{{L|Poseidon|Oh! Oh, oh, thank you. This mollusk has the rejuvenating power of a thousand facials.}}
{{L|Snail|''[Meows]''}}
{{L|''[Poseidon rubs the snail on his face, but it's not working, then he stops]''}}
{{L|Poseidon|What?! Is it empty?}}
{{L|''[He shakes the snail to see if they have any of them left, then he stops and the snail coughs]''}}

{{L|Plankton|Bon voyage, boys. I'm ready, I'm ready. They're dead.}}

{{L|Patrick|This is gonna be like one of those buddy movies. We're the buddies!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not sure that really applies Patrick, but--}}
{{L|Patrick|Why not? Were two buddies setting out with a common goal. We'll argue about something dumb, fight and breakups, only to come back when we realize neither could do it without the other. It's simple yet magical.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah. It feels more to me like the journey of a singular hero who against all odds, triumphs over adversity.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[snorts]'' I say buddy movie and you say, oh, whatever that dumb thing you said.}}
{{L|''[They begin to start an argument]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, really? Dumb thing, I'm dumb? Oh, I love your sense of irony, Patrick.}}
{{L|''[He then sees Patrick ironing his sweater and throws his iron and wears it]''}}

{{L|Patrick|I shouldn't have said your brain is made of sand. That was mean and dumb.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay. Let's just forget it, huh?}}
{{L|Patrick|Never happened.}}
{{L|''[Patrick then hugs SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh-huh.}}
{{L|''[As they went back to the car, SpongeBob takes out sand in his head, and Patrick takes out rocks in his head, while "On the Road Again" by Willie Nelson plays.]''}}

{{L|Patrick|Where are we?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We must be dreaming!}}
{{L|Patrick|You amuse me, SpongeBob. [starts to clean out his glasses] Two people can't have the same dream, let alone be in that same dream at the same time. That would be philosophically untenable.}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Indeed. You proffer a metaphysical conundrum.}}
{{L|Patrick|Wait, we're talking like smart people. This must be a dream!}}

{{L|Young Patrick|That's right. Yup.}}
{{L|Young Squidward|I… I did?}}

{{L|Mr. Krabs|But, I won't. I might even speak about how he inspired me when I was just a small-time vendor with a broken-down luncheonette. But I won't. Heck, I'd probably mention how he encouraged meto start up me own restaurant.}}

{{L|Mr. Krabs|But that's the funny thing. I used to think me secret Krabby Patty formula was also the secret to me success. We serve breakfast till 11, by the way, 12 on weekends. It wasn't until SpongeBob came to work for me that I realized the formula is more than just a list of ingredients and flavor-capturing methods. It's more than a jealously guarded recipe. The real secret formula is sitting right here, SpongeBob SquarePants.}}
