{{L|French Narrator|One extremely annoying shift later...}}
{{L|Squidward|''[screams and runs into his house. Locks door using every type of lock. Comes to crossword puzzle]'' A nine-letter word for annoying: SpongeBob. ''[writes "SpongeBob" on crossword]'' Ugh. ''[wipes his face]'' Finally. Some peace and quiet. ''[takes off his hat and puts his feet into slippers]'' No more SpongeBob, Just me, myself and home sweet home. ''[sits on his chair]'' Ahh. Nothing like a squid's good ol' chair to soothe the pains of a rough day. Just relax and contemplate some me time. ''[walks to the record player and disc]'' Perhaps I will dance to some soothing dance records. ''[puts the disc on the player and snaps fingers to the beat as well as dances]'' Or I could dabble a little on painting! ''[walks to the paint and pallet and paints, then sighs.]'' Yup. I sure am looking forward to it. ''[eel sting]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[eel sting]''}}
{{L|''[Laughter]''}}
{{L|''[eel sting]''}}
{{L|''[more laughter]''}}
{{L|Squidward|No, no, no! ''[walks to window and sees SpongeBob stinging Patrick with an electric eel.

What in the world are you doing out here?}}{{L|Patrick|Trying to have a relaxing evening.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're playing flashlight tag.}}
{{L|Squidward|You're playing flashlight tag with an electric eel?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're using the advanced rules.}}
{{L|Squidward|Advanced rules? ''[growls]'' That has got to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever-}}{{L|''[Patrick grabs the electric eel and has it sting Squidward who screeches]''}}{{L|Patrick|You're it.}}
{{L|''[Squidward gets a rash then screams and runs away.]}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, well played, Patrick!}}{{L|''[Squidward runs home, sobbing hysterically and rams into his house wall, becoming dazed, and the window rings fall at him and then the nose crushes him. Squidward digs his way into his house.]''}}{{L|Patrick|Shocking!}}{{L|Electric Eel|''[sarcastically]'' How original.}}
{{L|''[cuts to Squidward's house where he is under his chair in a fetal position]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[crying]'' All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax in peace ''[sniffs]'' and quiet.  Is that too much to ask? ''[sniffles again. SpongeBob pokes Squidward's head with a stick. Squidward tearfully looks up at him and Patrick.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, we're playing tag! Not hide and seek, you silly!}}
{{L|Patrick|But we like hide and seek too, if you want to play that.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[still crying]'' All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax ''[sniffles]'' in peace!'' [quietly whimpers. SpongeBob finally realizes something is wrong with Squidward]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, Squidward is really, really sad.}}
{{L|Patrick|You're right. Let's go poke someone else.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How about instead, we do something extra special for him! Then he won't be sad anymore!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, I get it. It'll be like the time  I was feeling impressed, and you let me eat all of Gary's... I mean feed Gary for a week.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, this has to be extra special, and we should probably vow to it.}}
{{L|Patrick|Vow?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, vow.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, how about instead of vowing, we just do it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I like it!}}
{{L|''[cuts to later that night]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[in bed]'' Good night... lamp. ''[turns lamp off. Then, sawing and hammering noises begin outside and he turns the lamp back on]'' I guess having a relaxing evening meant saying up all night with power tools! Well, it's not that late, even morons need to sleep sometime.}}
{{L|''[clock spins around until morning and construction sounds are still there]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I can't take it anymore!}}
{{L|''[runs downstairs grumbling]''}}
{{L|Squidward|When I get those two, I am gonna...! ''[opens the door]'' All right, you two, I... ''[gasps. he walks out his door to a Hawaiian-like beach with tikis, palms, and waterfalls]''}}
{{L|Squidward|It's, it's, it's... beautiful! ''[gazes in amazement]'' It's too good to be true! ''[sadly]'' It's a mirage! I knew it! ''[starts walking back to his house]'' I guess this is it. ''[Gary walks by with a coconut and Squidward grabs it]'' Insanity.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob slingshots a Hawaiian shirt on him. Patrick uses a fishing pole to reel down a hat, sunglasses, and a lei and drapes it around Squidward's head.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sadly]'' Next stop, padded room at the cephalopod home! ''[weeps, then looks at his drink and sighs]'' Just go with it, Squiddy.}}
{{L|''[Squidward walks around a bit, drinking his coconut along the way, then comes to a waterfall, goes inside, and takes a shower. Then he comes back out to see a tiki boat waiting for him. He gets in and floats down a stream, drinking the coconut. Then he realizes it is empty and notices a tiki bar ahead and stops.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|A refill, my good man! What the? ''[notices Patrick behind the bar blending a smoothie]'' Patrick?! What are you doing here?!}}
{{L|''[Patrick turns around and pours the drink into Squidward's coconut. While he takes out a newspaper and reads it, Squidward drinks the drink.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|It's delicious! What is it?}}
{{L|Patrick|A smoothie.}}
{{L|Squidward|Remember, Squiddy, just go with it.}}
{{L|''[tiki song starts as three tikis watch Squidward in the boat]''}}
{{L|Tiki #1|Hey fellas, look! it's Squidward!}}
{{L|Tiki #2|Hey, buddy, where ya been?}}
{{L|Squidward|Hit it boys!}}
{{L|Tikis|Welcome, to Squidward's Tiki Land! Welcome, to Squidward's Tiki Land! You can relax all day like a tiki can, or lay out in the sun for a tiki tan.}}{{L|Squidward|Or drink from a coconut that's full of flan! ''[drinks from the coconut]''}}{{L|Tikis|Here in Squidward's Tiki Land! You can play all day in a tiki band, and dance all night on the tiki strand.}}{{L|Squidward|Don't matter to me 'cause, 'cause I'm crazy, man!}}{{L|Tikis|Here in Squidward's Tiki Land! ''[song continues as Squidward floats down the stream]''}}{{L|Squidward|Ahhhh, this is the life!}}
{{L|''[Boat bumps onto land where SpongeBob puts out a canvas and paint. Squidward then paints a picture of the wonderful scenery]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's beautiful!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob hands Squidward his clarinet and he starts playing.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I've never felt this happy in my life! ''[laughs and grabs SpongeBob and Patrick by the hands and they start dancing in circles. They are laughing and having a good time until Patrick crashes into one of the tikis and knocks them all over in a domino-like effect. The world catches on fire and burns]'' My world!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are left looking at a charred pile of rubble]''}}
{{L|Patrick|You were right, SpongeBob. We should've used glue instead of earwax.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, especially considering neither of us have ears.}}
{{L|''[Squidward drops to his knees, sweating and completely saddened.]''}}{{L|Squidward|''[crying]'' You-you destroyed my beautiful world!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry we couldn't make it last forever, Squidward.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, we really tried to make it last.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sobbing]'' Yeah, ''[sniffles]'' make it last. ''[bawls uncontrollably]''}}
{{L|''[After Squidward finishes crying, he, SpongeBob and Patrick see the tiki boat still in one piece.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I know how to make it last!}}
{{L|''[Squidward has attached the boat to a swing and has SpongeBob and Patrick stand and take turns getting hit by it. Patrick gets hit and screams.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[laughs nastily]''}}{{L|''[SpongeBob appears, gets hit and screams, and the episode ends with Patrick and SpongeBob getting hit by the boat and screaming with Squidward laughing.]''}}
