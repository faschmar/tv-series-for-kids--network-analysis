{{L|''[Episode starts at Goo Lagoon. Patrick is running there wearing SpongeBob as a towel, and both are laughing. When they get there, he takes him off, then puts on his swimsuit]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I thought you left your swim suit at home.}}
{{L|Patrick|No, I just didn't want to get it all wrinkled up. Last one in is a rotten egg! ''[runs over to the lagoon, laughing]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Rotten eggs?! ''[runs over to Patrick laughing. Cuts to a scene showing a lot of people tanning. Nat Peterson takes out some tan accelerator]''}}
{{L|Shubie|Honey.}}
{{L|Nat|Huh?}}
{{L|Shubie|You're not using that tan accelerator again, are you?}}
{{L|Nat|Oh, don't pretend you don't love it. ''[pours the entire thing on him, and he turns into a strip of bacon]''}}
{{L|Craig|Good work, man! ''[Shubie gasps]'' I see you've read my book.}}
{{L|Nat|Craig Mammalton?}}
{{L|Shubie|The tannest man on TV?}}
{{L|Craig|''[laughs]'' None other. ''[winks, then a large crowd surrounds him]''}}
{{L|Sadie|Oh, look at those gorgeous wrinkles.}}
{{L|Craig|What, these? ''[shows off his wrinkles, then everyone cheers]''}}
{{L|Nancy|Oh, and his skin, it's so leathery!}}
{{L|Craig|Well, I don't mean to brag, but, uh... ''[pulls some of the skin on his feet, revealing leather, and everyone cheers again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Who's Craig Mammalton?}}
{{L|Sandals|You don't know who Craig Mammalton is? He's like, so tan! Legend has it that his tan is so deep, that even his bones are a rich caramel brown!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Wow!}}
{{L|Patrick|His mother must be so proud.}}
{{L|Craig|Please, people, please. There'll be plenty of time to admire my body this weekend, at my annual summer shindig. ''[everyone cheers, then lines up to receive invitations]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, Patrick, an invitation to our first summer shindig! And here it is! ''[Craig won't let go]''}}
{{L|Craig|Can I help you, little fella?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It seems to be stuck.}}
{{L|Craig|Yeah, I don't think this is your type of party. I don't want to embarrass you guys... Hey, everyone, check this out! ''[everyone comes back]'' ...but this party is for the pig-mentally gifted. ''[shows them the invitation]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Must be this tan to enter.}}
{{L|Craig|And your skin is as light and smooth as a, well, as a baby's bottom. ''[everyone laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why, thank you.}}
{{L|Patrick|We did put on a few extra coats of sun screen today.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|In fact, ''[gets a lot of sunscreen]'' it's time for another coat. ''[shapes it into a coat, and puts it on. Patrick also has a coat of sunscreen]''}}
{{L|Patrick|We've gotta look our best.}}
{{L|Sandals|''[hides it with a cough]'' Losers. ''[everyone laughs]''}}
{{L|Craig|You're not coming to my party, without a tan. ''[their coats then fall off. Scene then cuts to Patrick's rock. It then opens, revealing tanning lights]''}}
<font color="red>{{L|SpongeBob|There, now that we've turned your rock into a tanning bed, we're sure to get tan enough for the party! Let's just test it out first to be sure. ''[places an apple in the tanning bed. He then presses a button on the outside which turns it on. He then looks at his watch, then turns it off. The apple is all dried out]''}}
{{L|Both|Hooray! ''[both run around laughing]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Me first! Me first! ''[rips off his pants, revealing tanning shorts, then jumps on the bed. SpongeBob then turns it on, then off. Patrick has a really good tan. He then walks out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, Patrick, how do you feel?}}
{{L|Patrick|Like one of those hip young old folks from a soda commercial. ''[scene cuts to real live-action old man in a soda commercial]''}}
{{L|Old Man|It's radical! ''[drinks it]'' Radical! ''[drinks it again]'' Drink it! ''[scene then cuts back to SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My turn! ''[jumps in, and his pants and shirt vanish, revealing tanning shorts]''</font> Remember, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly.}}
{{L|Patrick|Gotcha, 15 seconds, give or take a few minutes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, no, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly! It's really important... ''[Patrick turns the tanning bed on. Scene then reveals SpongeBob tanning]'' It's working! ''[gets a good tan also]'' Okay, Patrick, I'm done. ''[no answer]'' Patrick? Patrick, you there? ''[Patrick is listening to music outside SpongeBob's house]'' Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|What? Did somebody say something? ''[a car with Shubie, Nazz, Evelyn, Sally, and Millie in it drives up to him]''}}
{{L|Ladies|Hey, there!}}
{{L|Sally|Is that tan for us?}}
{{L|Patrick|What? ''[they bring him into the boat and they drive off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, Patrick, it's time for me to get out! ''[begins to dry out]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Two hours later... ''[The boat then drives back up to Patrick's house]''}}
{{L|Millie|Do you really have to go, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Afraid so. Bye, girls.}}
{{L|Ladies|Bye, Pat.}}
{{L|Nazz|Oh, he's so leathery. ''[Patrick turns off the tanning bed, then SpongeBob comes out, and he's "Sun Bleached"]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in dried out voice]'' Well, Patrick, how do I look?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[screams]'' Oh, it's you. You don't look too good.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What, what, what do you mean?}}
{{L|Patrick|See for yourself. ''[pulls out a mirror, and SpongeBob screams in horror]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I must have been under the tanning machine too long! ''[cries, then Patrick pulls off some of his skin]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Ew, what are you going to do?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll ask Squidward, he's always so helpful. He'll know what to do. ''[cuts to them walking up to Squidward]'' Hi, Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|What is it now, Sponge---''[sees him and screams]'' Ghost! I'm sorry I was so mean to you while you were alive, please don't haunt me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I'm not a ghost, Squidward. ''[laughs]'' I used Patrick's tanning booth, and I stayed under too long.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[laughs]'' Oh, this is too precious! You're sun bleached! Looks like you won't be at the party. ''[walks into his house, then opens his top window]'' Sun Bleached!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh, now I'll never get into that party.}}
<font color="red>{{L|Patrick|Hey, that's quitter talk, mister! You're going to that party tonight! What you need, is a makeover! ''[cuts to SpongeBob on a rock next to Patrick. Patrick uses a hose to make mud, while whistling, then puts SpongeBob in it. He then wipes the mud out of his eyes, then takes out a bag of Kelp Jerky]'' A little Kelp Jerky? Open wide. ''[puts two strips of Kelp Jerky on SpongeBob's teeth. Patrick then pulls out his armpit hair, screams, then puts it on SpongeBob's head. He then gives him a mirror]'' What do you think?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams, then talks in his normal voice]'' I look... amazing! Time to go to the party! ''[cuts to them walking down the street. SpongeBob pats a baby in a stroller]'' Oh what a cute wittle baby. Cootchie-cootchie-coo.}}
{{L|Norma|Monster! ''[runs away, running over SpongeBob, then comes back and stomps on him then walks off screen]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, hey, buddy, looks like you could use an ice cream.</font> ''[cuts to them in an ice cream palace. SpongeBob is eating a shake, then uses his tongue like an anteater's tongue to eat the cherry]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, yeah, that hit the spot.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[talking to cashier]'' One caramel sundae, please. ''[cashier gives him one, then he goes back to the table]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I think you'll have to go to the party without me, Patrick. There's just no way I can get that golden brown in time. But that's no reason you shouldn't go. ''[Patrick throws some caramel on SpongeBob's face]'' Patrick, why did you...}}
{{L|Patrick|Can't talk, working.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, really, Patrick, what are you... ''[Patrick takes out a skim coat, smoothes out the caramel, then puts a cherry on SpongeBob's head]'' Ugh. I feel sticky.}}
{{L|Patrick|Take a look. ''[SpongeBob walks up to a mirror to see his 'newly tanned' body.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wooh! ''[hugs Patrick]'' Thanks, Patrick! ''[tries to let go, but he can't]'' Uh, I'm stuck. ''[Scene cuts to the Party. There is a long line, and Craig is judging the peopleâ€™s tans. He lets Gus in, then Evelyn comes up]''}}
{{L|Craig|Nice job, Ma'am. Join the party! Ahem, but the baby's going to have to wait outside.}}
{{L|Evelyn|But he's the perfect shade of ''Tropical Toddler''. ''[holds up a card to prove her point]''}}
{{L|Craig|Yes, but... ''[Craig pulls down the hem of his shorts, revealing his behind left un-tan]''}}
{{L|Evelyn|''[gasps]'' Tyler! How could you?!}}
{{L|Craig|Now, don't worry, Ma'am, he can wait out here, with the other rejects. ''[throws him in a trash can, next do a dumpster filled with un-tan people]''}}
{{L|Fish|Oh, no tears, son, we'll get in next year.}}
{{L|Craig|Next. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick walk up]'' Hey, hey, hey! Looks like you two took my advice! Nice job, gentlemen. Come on in! ''[scene cuts to the big party, where a lot of people are dancing]'' All right, party people! It's time to roll out the portables. ''[some fish bring some tanning lights. Craig then sets the setting on the remote to "Golden". The people begin to dance. SpongeBob and Patrick dance too. As SpongeBob keeps dancing, the tanning lights shine down on his caramel. His dancing starts to slow down]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, no! Caramel, hardening! Gotta get out of here! ''[tries to walk out, but the caramel hardens so much, he doesn't move.]'' ''[whispers]'' Patrick? Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Can I get a little help here?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, sure thing, pal. Hey, everybody, make some room! ''[everyone stops dancing and makes a circle around him and SpongeBob]'' The floor's all yours! Knock 'em dead, kid.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick, I... ''[notices the people staring at him and laughs nervously. The caramel cracks a little bit, which reveals some light. Everyone gasps, then the caramel cracks a little bit more, revealing some more light, and then, the caramel breaks apart, which reveals a massive white blinding light.]''}}
{{L|Frankie|So bright!}}
{{L|Sally|Honey, look away! ''[Frankie's eyes melt and he falls down to the floor. SpongeBob laughs nervously]''}}
{{L|Fred|Nice job!}}
{{L|Harold|Your hideously white skin just ruined the party. I mean, look at you! Do you hug your mother with that skin? ''[everyone complains]''}}
{{L|Tina|Can you believe this guy crashed your party? Craig? ''[Craig walks up to him]''}}
{{L|Craig|I have seen this only one other time. It's the ultimate tan. He's... ''[pulls a strip from the invitation, revealing the color skin that SpongeBob has]'' ...Sun Bleached. ''[all gasp, then Frankie puts his eyes back in his head, then gasps]''}}
{{L|Frankie|Sun Bleached?!}}
{{L|Craig|This young man... This young hero, should be praised for his dedication to tanliness. ''[all cheer]'' If you guys are feeling it, we should all follow in his footsteps. ''[all cheer again]'' Frankie, crank it up! ''[Frankie uses the remote to put the lights on "Bleached". Everyone dances, then the scene goes up]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Two hours later. ''[pans back down, revealing that everyone is dust]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Patrick. Do you think that maybe too much sun is a bad thing? ''[the wind blows the dust away, so now only their eyes are there]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Whatever. I just go with the flow.}}
