''[Now, he is shown walking to a mailbox with his mouth closed, but you can still hear his voice]'' If you would take the time to ''[puts the letter in the mailbox]'' answer all my neat questions, ''[starts to walk away]'' then that would be ''[walks back to the mailbox and puts the red flag up]'' really swell.}}
{{L|''[The scence cuts to the Bikini Bottom post office]''}}
{{L|''[A mailfish drives a car full of sacks of letters to the post office. After sorting a few letters, he comes across SpongeBob's envelope, which says, "To Vikings" with a heart below the words. He takes the envelope, walks outside, and throws it away. Two men in a garbage truck pull up to the garbage cans. The men play rock, paper, scissors. The man who was driving plays paper, and the other man plays scissors. The driver goes outside, grabs a garbage can, and trips on his own shoe lace. Trash spills everywhere, but SpongeBob's letter lands right in front of the driver. He picks the envelope up, takes one look at it and stands up. The other garbage man knocks on the windshield of the truck, but the driver just runs away. His hat falls off to reveal a Viking helmet. A viking waits at the bus stop with Fred, Old Man Jenkins, and Ms. Shell. Fred, Old Man Jenkins, and Ms. Shell stare at the garbage-scented Viking. a bus drives through sun light, rain, and snow. Meanwhile, the Viking is shown riding a bike. He rides around mountains. Soon, the top of the mountain range is shown.]''}}

{{L|Squidward|''[appears in front of Gordon]'' Hold it right there, whiskers! Let's not forget you're the one who dragged me onto this crate in the first place! Now, you ask me to pour my heart out, and this is the respect I get?! Well, you got another thing coming, honey! I want off this boat, pronto! ''[appears in the catapult]'' On second thought, bathroom attendants make me some tips. Well, look on the bright side, Squidward. No more living next door to SpongeBob. Let her rip, Jack-o!}}
{{L|''[Purple Olaf pulls back his hammer and gets ready to launch Squidward]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait! ''[stops the hammer]'' You can't do that.}}
{{L|Gordon|You mean to question the vill of the tribe?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|If it means saving my best friend, then yes.}}
{{L|Gordon|''[throws an axe in front of SpongeBob]'' Well. Then pick up the weapon and fight with me a duel in accordance with the prophecy! ''[pulls a sword out of no where]''}}
{{L|Olafs|Duel, duel, duel, duel!}}
