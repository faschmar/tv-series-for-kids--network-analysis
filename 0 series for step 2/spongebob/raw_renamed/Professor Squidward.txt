{{L|''[Transitions to an outside view of the Bikini Bottom Recital Hall. Inside, on the stage is Squilliam Fancyson. Flowers are being thrown to him]''}}
{{L|Squilliam|Thank you. ''[he bows]'' Thank you. ''[he catches a flower and sniffs it]'' Ah.}}
{{L|''[Squidward, in a sweater the same color as his usual shirt, watches, irritated, in the audience. A fish next to him leans over him]''}}
{{L|Music Lover|Isn't it grand?}}
{{L|Squidward|What is?}}
{{L|Music Lover|He's such a great musician. He doesn't even have to touch an instrument to be brilliant! ''[The clarinet plays on a table besides Squilliam. He moves his arms towards it and the cheering of the crowd gets louder]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Alright, I've had enough! ''[He stands up and walks out]'' Bunch of nonsense!}}
{{L|Music School Headmaster|Why, here he comes now.}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|''[gasps]'' It ''is'' him!}}
{{L|Squidward|Huh?}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|Aren't you the esteemed Squilliam Fancyson the Third, who we all came here to see perform tonight?}}
{{L|Squidward|No, I am not, nor would I ever want to be! I am quite content being Squidward Q. Tentacles.}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|Oh, dear. Well, that's too bad.}}
{{L|Squidward|Why?}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|Because I'm head matron at an esteemed musical college in town and thought if you ''were'' Squilliam Fancyson, I would offer you the high-paying and prestigious opportunity to come there and teach your very own music class.}}
{{L|Squidward|My very own music class? Did you say "Squilliam Fancyson"?}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|Yes.}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm... Squilliam Fancyson.}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|But didn't you just say a minute ago that your name was Squidward Q. Tentacles?}}
{{L|Squidward|It is... No, I mean, uh, no, no, I didn't!}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|Well, that's a relief. I mean, what kind of a moron would go to their worst enemy's music recital?}}
{{L|Music School Headmaster|A very pathetic one, that's whom. ''[both laugh]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[pretends to laugh]'' Oh.}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|Well, good evening, Professor Squilliam.}}
{{L|Squidward|Who? Ha, um, uh, and a good evening to you as well. ''[runs off]''}}
{{L|Music School Headmaster|Hmm, music types.}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|Ooh, they're so strange.}}
<font color="red">{{L|''[Transitions to Squidward's music teaching lesson building. Inside, Squidward, wearing a large white curly wig, enters the classroom]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[clears throat]'' Good evening, students. Now, our first...}}
{{L|Students|Good evening, Professor.}}
{{L|Squidward|As I was saying, our first...}}
{{L|''[Billy puts his hand up]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Yes?}}
{{L|Billy|Aren't you gonna write your name on the board like most professors do?}}
{{L|Squidward|My-my name? What for?}}
{{L|Billy|Well, you know, it just seems like teachers usually write their names on the board the first day of class.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sighs]'' Why don't ''you'' come write ''your'' name on the board? We'll see how ''you'' like it.}}
{{L|Billy|Okay.}}
{{L|''[Billy walks up to the board and writes his name]''}}
{{L|Squidward|There, now how does ''that'' feel, Billy?}}
{{L|Billy|Okay, I-I guess.}}
{{L|Squidward|Good. Now, why don't you take your seat and stop poking your nose into other people's business?! ''[Billy walks back to his seat]'' Now, if we can go for five minutes without having any further interruptions. I would like to...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughing and pointing at Squidward]'' Hey, look! It's Squid... ''[Squidward quickly puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth, cutting off the rest of his speech]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Squilliam, everybody, he was about to say "Squilliam"!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, uh, oh, actually, I think he was about to say Squid... ''[Squidward puts his other hand over Patrick's mouth and Patrick mumbles]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[nervously]'' Didn't you two nincompoops know? I have my name legally changed to Squilliam Fancyson. And you are to refer to me only as Professor Squilliam from now until the end of time. Now blink twice so I know you understand. ''[Patrick and SpongeBob blink twice]'' Okay, good. ''[Patrick blinks one more time]'' Hey, he blinked three times!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, only eight minutes in and we've already been given a math quiz. Very advanced music class, huh, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'll say.}}
{{L|Squidward|Would you two numb skulls mind telling me what you're doing in music class anyway?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure! Patrick's New Year's resolution was to learn to play an instrument!}}
{{L|Squidward|You told me your resolution was to sign up for an all natural slimming, toning, and increased muscle mass program!}}
{{L|Patrick|It was. I traded with SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And I have been very happy with the results. See? ''[shows his muscular leg to Squidward]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Wow, those ''are'' impressive results.}}</font>
{{L|''[Transitions to later in the classroom]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[clears throat]'' As you may not be aware, music is a... ''[SpongeBob giggles]'' Music is a... ''[SpongeBob giggles]'' Music is a complicated series of... ''[SpongeBob giggles. Squidward glares at the class]'' ...is a complicated series of notes that when played in the... ''[SpongeBob giggles. Squidward stomps up to him]'' SpongeBob, do you mind?! There are other people here besides you, you know. And I don't think they appreciate you depriving them of my wisdom!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sighs]'' I'm sorry, Professor Squilliam. ''[SpongeBob winks at Squidward]'' Patrick here keeps tickling my foot.}}
{{L|Patrick|No way! He's making that up! It was him!}}
{{L|Squidward|You expect me to believe he was tickling himself?}}
{{L|Patrick|You better tell him, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Alright, it was me.}}
{{L|Squidward|You were tickling yourself?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mm hmm!}}
{{L|Squidward|How?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Like this. ''[close up of him rubbing his shoes together. SpongeBob bursts out laughing and continuously rubs his feet together]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Alright, that's enough!}}
{{L|''[Transitions to show the students now in a straight line, with SpongeBob and Patrick at both ends]''}}
{{L|Squidward|There. Now, as I was saying, music is a series of complex... ''[SpongeBob laughs]'' SpongeBob, I told you to stop tickling yourself!}}
{{L|Patrick|Actually, that time, it really was me.}}
{{L|''[Squidward looks baffled, transitions to later]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Now, I'm going to put some notes on the chalkboard. ''[Squidward goes to the board and draws a staff. Patrick starts whispering to SpongeBob]'' Excuse me? Is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh-uh.}}
{{L|Squidward|Go on, you've already interrupted once. You might as well tell us what was so very important.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, I was just saying that these lines you drew remind me of a railroad track.}}
{{L|Squidward|I have never heard anything more insipid, insane, uninteresting, or irrelevant!}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, actually, there ''was'' a railroad convention in town last week, and I bought myself this nifty conductor's cap. ''[he takes out the hat and puts it on]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I have never seen a more ridiculous looking outfit on top of anybody's head, anywhere!}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, I don't know. Suits my needs.}}
{{L|Squidward|What else did you buy at this convention? Your very own locomotive? ''[starts laughing. Patrick pulls up a toy train]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes.}}
{{L|Squidward|Ha! Ha! Ha! What the...?}}
{{L|''[Patrick, now shrunk down to the train's size, climbs into the train, toots the horn and drives the train on a track going past SpongeBob and the other students. It then goes into what appears to be a tunnel which is then shown to be a garbage can being held by Squidward. Squidward then takes the can outside and dumps it with the other cans, then he goes back inside]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Now, where were... ''[sees Patrick back in his seat]'' ...we?}}
{{L|''[Transitions to later]''}}
{{L|Squidward|This is what's known as a metronome.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, my mom has one of those in her garden!}}
{{L|Patrick|No, SpongeBob, that was a garden gnome.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[clears throat]'' Anyway, the metronome helps us keep time.}}
{{L|''[He starts the metronome and it starts ticking. SpongeBob and Patrick suddenly start staring at the metronome as though they are in a trance. They start swaying to the rhythm]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick...}}
{{L|Squidward|Do you mind? ''[they don't respond]'' Is there something seriously wrong with your HEADS?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My whole life has been pointed in one direction.}}
{{L|Patrick|I see that now. There's never been any choice for me.}}
{{L|Squidward|Will you two nincompoops cut it out?! Or am I gonna...}}
{{L|''[Knocking on the door. A news reporter and a cameraman enter the classroom]''}}
{{L|Bikini Bottom News Reporter|Hello! We're with the local Bikini Bottom News Channel. I'm a reporter. ''[Squidward gasps and neatens his wig]'' We're here to conduct an interview with the esteemed musical genius Squilliam Fancyson.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick are still ticking]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Please ignore them.}}
{{L|Bikini Bottom News Reporter|Are those students of yours?}}
{{L|Squidward|Nope, they're just morons. Come on, you two, snap out of it!}}
{{L|Bikini Bottom News Reporter|They appear to be in some type of trance. A case of genuine hypnosis like this make a much hotter scoop.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hotter? Scoop?!}}
{{L|Bikini Bottom News Reporter|Well, it's the sort of thing that borders the paranormal. Our viewers just eat that stuff up.}}
{{L|Squidward|Paranormal?! The only thing paranormal around here is how fast I'm going to make you two disappear!! ''[he starts pushing the reporter and cameraman out of the room]''}}
{{L|Bikini Bottom News Reporter|Don't blame me, blame the market. ''[Squidward slams door. A bell rings and SpongeBob and Patrick jolt as though they have woken up]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wha...? Where am I? I felt like I was in some sort of horrible trance. ''[Squidward's eyes narrow angrily]''}}
{{L|Squidward|You wanna know what happened?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Okay!}}
{{L|Squidward|You once again managed to single-handedly annihilate what might be the one and only chance I may ever get to sew just one tiny seed of creative hope into the culturally barren wasteland that each and every one of us is forced to call home!}}
{{L|Harold|Actually, I've been commuting from upstate.}}
{{L|Squidward|Now, I don't suppose you two have anything to say for yourselves?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I guess if I was to say one thing, it would have to be: We're sorry, Squidward. ''[Squidward looks horrified as SpongeBob revealed Squidward's name]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, we're sorry, Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[frantic]'' No, no, no, no, no! Shh shh shh...}}
{{L|Harold|Hey, did those guys just call you Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[frantic]'' No, no, no, no, no! They said "Squilliam"!}}
{{L|Gus|Oh! I knew this guy was phony from minute one! I'm gettin' outta here.}}
{{L|Harold|Yeah, me, too! I'm gonna get my tuition back!}}
{{L|Squidward|No! Wait! ''[Everyone walks to the door and Squidward blocks it]'' NO! You're not going anywhere!}}
{{L|''[The door is smashed open and several police fish run in. Squidward, who was flattened against the wall by the door, is grabbed by them]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Wha-What's going on here?}}
{{L|Johnson|Sorry, Professor, your little symphony is over.}}
{{L|''[Music School Headmistress and the real Squilliam Fancyson are there]''}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|It's true, we're onto your little ruse! ''[The reporter and cameraman are there too]''}}
{{L|Bikini Bottom News Reporter|What a hot scoop!}}
{{L|Music School Headmistress|The ''real'' Squilliam, as we all know, has a large, bushy unibrow just at the base of his forehead! ''[She points to Squilliam's unibrow]''}}
{{L|Squidward|But...}}
{{L|''[A police fish takes Squidward's wig off]''}}
{{L|Green Police Fish|No unibrow. Squidward Q. Tentacles, I'm placing you under arrest for impersonating a genius.}}
{{L|''[Squidward is handcuffed and taken away by the police. SpongeBob takes out the metronome, starts it, and he and Patrick start swaying to the rhythm again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick...}}
