{{L|''[SpongeBob is sitting inside of his mailbox, happily humming. He checks his watch. The mailman arrives opens the mailbox, and SpongeBob suddenly pops out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, mailman!}}
{{L|''[The mailman drops his mail, screams in terror and runs away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, ''[gets out of the mailbox]'' see you tomorrow!}}
{{L|''[Patrick walks up]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's see... ''[looks through the mail]'' Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, hey! A magazine!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob looks at the magazine]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[look inside the magazine]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!}}
{{L|''[A picture of a rich person's swimming pool is shown]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!}}
{{L|''[A picture is shown of an old, rich person surrounded with bags of money]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[points at the man's feet]'' This guy's got shoes!}}
{{L|Squidward|Give me that! ''[takes the magazine out of their hands]'' Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?}}
{{L|Squidward|They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What kind of things?}}
{{L|Squidward|How should I know? Things people wanna buy. ''[walks off]'' Now keep your paws off my mail.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's it, Patrick! We gotta become entrepreneurs!}}
{{L|Patrick|Is that gonna hurt?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Quick, Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh... ''[sweats]'' More time for thinking.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, something real, an item, something you would pay for.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[pops up behind him]'' A chocolate bar?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick exiting the Barg'N-Mart carrying many chocolate bars]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Fancy living, here we come!}}
{{L|Patrick|Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a house]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob runs up and knocks on the door, Tom the fish opens the door]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good afternoon, sir, could we interest you in some ''[holds up chocolate bar]'' chocolate?}}
{{L|Tom|Chocolate? Did you say, Chocolate?!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes, sir. With or without nuts?}}
{{L|Tom|Chocolate?! ''[screaming]'' Chocolate?! Chocolate! Chocolate!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick slowly back away, and then run off. Tom chases them while madly screaming "Chocolate!". The scene cuts to SpongeBob ringing the doorbell of another house]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, the first guy didn't count. This is our real first step! ''[A con man opens the door]'' Good morning, sir! Would you like to buy some chocolate?}}
{{L|Con man|Chocolate bars, eh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen!}}
{{L|Con man|Ha! A couple of mediocre salesmen if you ask me. That's no way to carry your merchandise!}}
{{L|''[Patrick is shown holding many chocolate bars in his pants]''}}
{{L|Con man|No, no no no, wrong. You guys wanna be good salesmen, right?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Oh, most certainly, sir!}}
{{L|Con man|Well, ''[chuckles]'' no self respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these! ''[holds up a bright-orange bag]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow... what is it?}}
{{L|Con man|It's a candy bar bag, you knucklehead! It's specially designed to cradle each candy bar in velvet-lined comfort!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob tries to touch it]''}}
{{L|Con man|''[pulls bag away]'' But, I'm wasting my time. ''[walks inside]'' You don't need these bags.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|We need 'em! We need 'em!}}
{{L|''[The con man grins, the scene changes to the con man counting money. SpongeBob and Patrick are walking away with armfuls of bags]''}}
{{L|Con man|So long, boys! Happy hunting! ''[laughs when the two aren't looking]'' Suckers... ''[walks back inside]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[singing as they run off]'' Fancy livin', here we come! La la la la, la!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's try next door!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob walks up and rings the doorbell with his foot, the same con man comes out]''}}
{{L|Con man|Yes?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?}}
{{L|Con man|I... don't recall. But it looks to me like you fellas have got a lot of bags there. You two lady killers are too smart to be without one of my patented Candy Bar Bag Carrying Bags. ''[holds up two large maroon bags]''}}
{{L|Patrick|We'll take twenty!}}
{{L|''[Scene changes to SpongeBob knocking on the door of a different house, Sadie comes out]''}}
{{L|Sadie|Oh, what can I do for you two nice young men?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?}}
{{L|Sadie|That sounds heavenly! I'll take one.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|One chocolate bar, coming up!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob attempts to pull out a chocolate bar, but keeps pulling more bags, while Patrick is zipping and unzipping his pants]''}}
{{L|Sadie|''[Sadie looks at her watch]'' I don't have time for this.}}
{{L|''[Sadie goes back inside, and then SpongeBob pulls out a chocolate bar]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice— ''[sees something off camera; it is revealed to be Tom, still screaming]''}}
{{L|Tom|Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|—lady. ''[Tom chases SpongeBob and Patrick again while screaming "Chocolate!". The scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick sitting in a diner]'' We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate. There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags?}}
{{L|Patrick|He said we were mediocre...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's it! He made us feel special!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!}}
{{L|''[Patrick runs to the door]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, wait, Patrick!}}
{{L|''[Patrick freezes in place]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why don't we try being nice?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, okay.}}
{{L|''[Scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick walking up to a customer's door]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Remember, Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good.}}
{{L|''[Patrick knocks on the door, a customer opens the door]''}}
{{L|Blue Fish with purple stripes|Hello?}}
{{L|Patrick|I love you.}}
{{L|''[A harp is heard playing, the customer stares at SpongeBob and Patrick for a few seconds, then he slams his door shut in extreme disgust, a tuba is heard playing after the slamming]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob rings the doorbell, the customer opens the door]''}}
{{L|Blue Fish with purple stripes|Please. G-Go away!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um, ''[clears throat]'' H-H-How you doin'?}}
{{L|Blue Fish with purple stripes|How am I doing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wanna buy some chocolate?}}
{{L|Patrick|We got him now!}}
{{L|Blue Fish with purple stripes|Sorry, chocolate has sugar and sugar turns to bubbling fat. Isn't that right, lover boy?}}
{{L|''[Patrick's belly is bubbling]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hee hee, it tickles!}}
{{L|Blue Fish with purple stripes|As you can see, me and chocolate no longer hang.}}
{{L|''[The customer holds up a picture of an obese self at age 13]''}}
{{L|Blue Fish with purple stripes|You can keep that for five bucks.}}
{{L|Patrick|I'll take ten!}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob with a sad look on his face walking, a sad song plays]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that we're too easily distracted.}}
{{L|''[Cut to Patrick staring at the pictures]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Huh?}}
{{L|''[Far cut]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[raises his fist]'' Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[removes pictures from his face]'' Huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[holds out his hand]'' Let's shake on it.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[looks at SpongeBob confused]'' Did you say something?}}
{{L|''[Cut to the other customer's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are seen entering the view]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Remember, Patrick, focus.}}
{{L|''[Cut to the door, SpongeBob knocks on it, customer answers]''}}
{{L|Purple Fish|Yes?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars.}}
{{L|''[Patrick somehow moves up to the customer with his eyes going in and out back and forth]''}}
{{L|Purple Fish|Why is Chubby here staring at me?}}
{{L|''[Cut to Patrick's eyes]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Focusing.}}
{{L|''[Cut to the inside of the customer's house]''}}
{{L|Purple Fish|''[freaks out]'' Back up, Jack!}}
{{L|''[The customer slams the door on Patrick's eyes; Patrick is heard saying "Oof!" from the other side of the door]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[moves his eyes around]'' Nice place you got in here.}}
{{L|''[Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Patrick is eating a chocolate bar]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't understand what were doing wrong.}}
{{L|Patrick|I can't understand anything.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!}}
{{L|''[Cut to the sign]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[reading the sign]'' Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|They are most certainly not delicious!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[smiling]'' Not the way I use them!}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yet they sell millions of bags a day!}}
{{L|''[Cut to Patrick]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[happily]'' That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!}}
{{L|Tom|Chocolate!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick run off, cut to Mary's house]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill!}}
{{L|Patrick|The kill!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob uses the doorbell, Mary answers]''}}
{{L|Mary|Yes?}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hello, young lady.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob winks at Patrick, Patrick then chuckles]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're selling chocolate. ''[gets a closer look at Mary]'' Is your mother home? }}
{{L|''[Cut to Mary]''}}
{{L|Mary|Mom!}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|''[enters from the right side of the house]'' What, what, what's all the yelling?}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick who have stunned looks on their faces. Cut back to Mary's mother]''}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|You just can't wait for me to die, can you?}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|Mary|They're selling chocolate.}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|Chocolate?}}
{{L|Mary|Yeah!}}
{{L|''[Cut to Mary and her mom]''}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|What, what are they selling?}}
{{L|Mary|Chocolates!}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|What?}}
{{L|Mary|Chocolates!}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|I can't hear you!}}
{{L|Mary|They're selling chocolates!}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|They're selling chocolate?}}
{{L|Mary|Yeah!}}
{{L|''[Cut to a close-up of Mary's mother smiling]''}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate.}}
{{L|''[Cut back to view Mary and her mom]''}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|I always hated it!}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob sweating]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for...}}
{{L|''[Patrick comes from the top left]''}}
{{L|Patrick|You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.}}
{{L|''[Cut to Mary and her mom, Mary is heard saying no constantly]''}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|Live forever, you say? I'll take one. ''[Mary slaps her face. Cut to the outside, Mary pays SpongeBob a dollar]''}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|''[from inside the house]'' Come on, you lazy Mary! ''[cut to Mary]'' Start rubbing me with that chocolate!}}
{{L|Mary|''[looks at SpongeBob and Patrick angrily]'' I hate you. ''[slams the door. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[raises fist]'' Hooray for lying!}}
{{L|''[Bubbles transition to SpongeBob and Patrick, Patrick is seen with a look that was about to make him laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It'll make your hair grow.}}
{{L|''[Cut to Fred]''}}
{{L|Fred|Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, Patrick has a sad face this time]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|They'll make you sound smart.}}
{{L|''[Cut to the customer holding money]''}}
{{L|Customer|''[southern accent]'' I'll take twenty!}}
{{L|''[Cut to Patrick]''}}
{{L|Patrick|It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.}}
{{L|''[Cut to the two Patricks]''}}
{{L|Patrick 2|Just in time.}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick over and over]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|They'll make you fly!}}
{{L|Patrick|You'll fall in love!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|They'll bring world peace!}}
{{L|Patrick|You'll walk through walls!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[echoing]'' You'll rule the world!}}
{{L|''[Cut to a door, SpongeBob and Patrick are wrapped in casts. Cut close to Patrick]''}}
{{L|Patrick|This'll be the best lie yet!}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!}}
{{L|''[Customer opens door]''}}
{{L|Customer|What can I do for you boys?}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation.}}
{{L|Customer|Really?}}
{{L|''[Cut to the customer, who apparently is in a cast covering his entire body]''}}
{{L|Customer|Small world. What's the matter with you guys?}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are completely stunned]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[nervously]'' Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding.}}
{{L|''[Cut to the customer]''}}
{{L|Customer|Ah, some guys have all the luck.}}
{{L|''[A violin begins]''}}
{{L|Customer|I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms.}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, they both have faces meaning that they were about to cry]''}}
{{L|Customer|At night, ''[As SpongeBob looks up sadly, a tear runs down his face]'' I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.}}
{{L|''[Cut to the customer, the wires snap]''}}
{{L|Customer|''[About to fall]'' Oh, no...}}
{{L|''[A glass breaking sound is heard while the customer grunts while hitting the steps]''}}
{{L|Customer|''[on the last step]'' Ow...}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Quick, Patrick, let's help him!}}
{{L|''[Cut to the inside of the house. SpongeBob and Patrick enter from the left]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Careful, put him down gently.}}
{{L|''[Patrick drops the customer's head, a glass breaking sound is heard, cut close to the customer]''}}
{{L|Customer|''[in pain]'' Ow...!}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?}}
{{L|''[Cut to the customer]''}}
{{L|Customer|Well, there is one thing... as you can well imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars. ''[gestures his head over to a massive stack of chocolate bar boxes. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Cut to the customer looking out his window as SpongeBob and Patrick walk by]''}}
{{L|Customer|Such nice boys, ''[far cut to the customer]'' it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! Ha ha ha!}}
{{L|''[Cut to a close-up of the customer laughing while looking at his cash, zipping his costume off to reveal himself as the con artist from earlier. Cut to the street]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grunting]'' Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob makes another grunting noise, he trips up on a rock and falls, cut to SpongeBob with a box flat on his face]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's face it, Patrick. We're failures.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[walks in from the left]'' I can live with that. ''[places the box on SpongeBob's box and sits on it, making a small squeaking sound]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's change our names to Why and Bother.}}
{{L|''[Tom appears behind the box]''}}
{{L|Tom|Chocolate! ''[screams and knocks SpongeBob, Patrick and the boxes over. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick babble]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[simultaneously with Patrick]'' No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...}}
{{L|Patrick|''[simultaneously with SpongeBob]'' No! Have mercy on me! Please spare me!}}
{{L|''[Cuts to Tom laughing manically]''}}
{{L|Tom|Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you... ''[turns back to normal]'' I'd like to buy all your chocolate. ''[Holds up a large amount of cash. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick looking shocked, chocolate bars fall out of Patrick's shorts, along with a Hershey's kiss. Cut back to the three, SpongeBob and Patrick melt]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thank you for your patronage.}}
{{L|''[Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene, Patrick is pushing a wheelbarrow]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|''[Cut to the money in the barrel, SpongeBob pops out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money.}}
{{L|''[Cut to the two]''}}
{{L|Patrick|But what are we going to spend it on?}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob thinking. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene, a boat in a bottle with "Fancy!" on top is seen. Cut to the inside of the boat]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[walking in from the left]'' Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.}}
{{L|Server|Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party.}}
{{L|''[Cut to Squidward shocked]''}}
{{L|Squidward|But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restaurant?}}
{{L|Server|Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs ''[leans over to Squidward]'' and their dates.}}
{{L|''[Cut to SpongeBob, Patrick, Mary, and Mary's mother; Mary is seen holding a glass]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So, how long have you two ladies known each other?}}
{{L|''[Pause]''}}
{{L|Mary's Mother|What? What did he say?}}
