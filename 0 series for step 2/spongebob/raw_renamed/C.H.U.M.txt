{{L|''[The episode begins with the camera panning on the Chum Bucket and Plankton chuckling]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[chuckling while going inside the Chum Bucket glove. He puts on an analyzing helmet and analyzes The Krusty Krab]'' Very sloppy, Eugene, leaving an unprotected vent that leads right into your office! ''[chuckles and launches a plunger under the vent]'' Perfect! The secret formula is as good as mine! ''[chuckles and the plunger drags him]'' Yaaaaaaah! ''[crashes into the vent]'' Oof! I made it! Yes! ''[starts unscrewing a bolt]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[The F.U.N. song starts playing on his headphones and splashes the windows with soap. He grabs the hose and it spins him around]'' Whoa, whoa! ''[Spraying the water to the soap in the letters]'' F  is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me! ''[Sprays water inside him and he inflates to the third window and sprays out water to make an N]'' N is for anywhere and anytime at all! ''[point the hose up]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Eh? ''[the hose water splashes him and turns into a hand and slaps him.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Down here in the deep blue sea! }}
{{L|Plankton|''[falls and tries to swim back up from the hose water but he falls into the sewer]'' Aah! ''[Plankton comes out of a faucet and lands on Bubble Bass' toothbrush]'' Ooh!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass' Mom|Bubble Bass! Are you brushing your teeth?}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Yes, mother! Ugh.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Smells Bubble Bass' breath and gags. Bubble Bass starts to brush his teeth]'' Oh, no.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[While brushing his teeth, Plankton is grunting inside. He brushes his tongue, and his teeth and spits out. His teeth then are shiny.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[falls down the drain until he ends up in a sewer]'' Yuck! This place is filthier than the bathroom in my own paternity house. Time to get outta here! ''[The sewer starts shaking]'' Aaah! Terrified, mind blank, possible wetting pants! Wait, I don't wear pants. Oh, lucky me!  ''[an alligator appears behind him and Plankton whimpers until a group of chum scare it away]'' That's right, you better run! ''[looks behind him]'' Huh? ''[The C.H.U.M.S appear]'' Terror double ! Please, I'll do whatever you say! Just down hurt me! ''[Starts crying]''}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|''[bows down]'' We would never hurt the master! ''[The other C.H.U.M.S. bow down along with the leader]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Wait, what now?}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|We are praising you, the master creator! ''[They and the other C.H.U.M.S bow down]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Me?}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|Yes! We are C.H.U.M.: Collective Hive Under Master! ''[bows down]'' You are master! You create us when you flush chum into sewer from your upside domain.}}
{{L|Plankton|You mean the Chum Bucket?}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|Yes! Chum mixes with gases in sewer... ''[A C.H.U.M. burps into a bucket of chum]'' ...to form we!}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Baby|Goo, goo!}}
{{L|Plankton|Hmm. Makes sense! ''[Some C.H.U.M. surround him]'' In a stupid sort of way. ''[The C.H.U.M. form into a boat]'' Yee! Whoa! What's happening?}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|Master must come to village! ''[rows boat with a spork]'' So we may worship him!}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, I do love to be worshipped. ''[blinks twice]'' Hold on, how did you recognize me?}}
{{L|C.H.U.M Leader|From sacred scrapbook! ''[The scrapbook appears out of the C.H.U.M.'s body]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yah! ''[A pipe decapitates the C.H.U.M. Leader's head. The neck grabs the head and puts it back on.]''}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|We save all articles about master that float down here. Here review of Chum Bucket! You get one negative toilet. That must be highest rating possible.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[chuckles nervously]'' Yep! That's the highest, alright! Let's just close that.}}
{{L|C.H.U.M.|''[Carries Plankton onto a chum throne]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[removes the chum on him until the C.H.U.M.S carry him to the village. They lower him down and he slides into the C.H.U.M. Leader.]''}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|The master is pleased with our village?}}
{{L|Plankton|Uh, sure. Why not?}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|Oh, thank you, master! Thank you! ''[shakes Plankton's hands]''}}
{{L|Plankton|That's enough of that! Do you have a napkin or something I can use to wipe my hands off?}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|A napkin for master!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[While C.H.U.M.S offer him a napkin, he takes one]'' Thanks, but try to be a little faster next time. So you C.H.U.M. would really do anything for me?}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|Yes, yes! Whatever the master wishes! ''[Squeezes Plankton until he launches up in the air]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Hm, this gives me an idea! I don't need to steal the secret Krabby Patty formula by stealth! With you C.H.U.M. by my side, I can take it by force!}}
{{L|C.H.U.M Leader|Yes, yes! Whatever the master wishes!}}
{{L|Plankton|Ew. ''[Pushes C.H.U.M. Leader]'' Alright, then! Line up for assault training! ''[laughs evilly, then bubble wipe to the next scene]''}}
{{L|C.H.U.M.|''[plays a fanfare]''}}
{{L|Plankton|In order to successfully infiltrate The Krusty Krab, you'll need to batter some doors down! Now get to battering! ''[The C.H.U.M. form into a battering ram and batters the door]'' You call that battering? batter harder! ''[falls down the door]'' Wait, no, stop! ''[The C.H.U.M. runs over him and fully batters the door.]''}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|How was that, master?}}
{{L|Plankton|In order for my plan to succeed, you will need to be experts marksmen. ''[clapping]'' Line up and form up! ''[The C.H.U.M. form into weaponry]'' Hold on, hold on,  let me just put up this target before you fire.}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|Master say fire! ''[The C.H.U.M. start launching]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Uh-oh! ''[Avoids every shot except for the third. He falls out]''}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|How was our aim, master?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[muffled]'' Eh, impeccable. ''[bubble wipe to the next scene]'' When we finally enter The Krusty Krab, you will face an enemy more evil than any of you can imagine! ''[The C.H.U.M.S. gasp when they see cardboard cut outs of SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|To get past Krabs and his vial cronies, and make it to the secret formula, you will need to be experts at the deadly art of Kah-Rah-Tay! ''[does karate at the cutouts]'' Now show master what you've got! ''[The C.H.U.M. form into a hand and smash the cutouts and Plankton]'' A+, you're ready! ''[Mr. Krabs cutout falls on Plankton. Bubble wipe to the next scene with Mr. Krabs washing his hands]'' Hello, Eugene!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Plankton? Ah, get out of here before I flush you!}}
{{L|Plankton|The only thing getting flushed around here is your hopes of The Krabby Patty formula not being stolen by me!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ha! You and what army?}}
{{L|Plankton|Me and my C.H.U.M. army! ''The C.H.U.M. starts coming out of the stalls]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Plankton, what insanity is this?}}
{{L|Plankton|The insanity of genius!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What's that chum doing?}}
{{L|Plankton|Anything I want it to do! ''[The C.H.U.M. form into a tank, then he chuckles]'' Oh, Krabs, you look a little hungry! Give him a taste, boys! ''[The tank launches chum at Mr. Krabs. He dodges them two times and holds himself upside down until the third chum hits the door and spins him. Another chum is fired and launches him to the window]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sees SpongeBob playing with the hose]'' SpongeBob! SpongeBob! ''[falls over]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[C.H.U.M. grabs his eyes and he pulls it out. He runs to hide in the cash register]'' You'll never get me formuler!}}
{{L|Plankton|Today your formula, tomorrow the world! ''[comes in with C.H.U.M. tank] Ya can't hide forever, Krabs! Come meet your stinky fate!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[attacks the chum with a bag of flour, swings on the Order Here sign, and climbs to the top of wood]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Sorry, Krabs, your aging acrobatics are no match for my C.H.U.M. monster!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[swings on a rope]'' So long, sucker! ''[C.H.U.M. monster pulls on the rope]'' Oh, shrimp! ''[lands on a table which breaks and runs]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Attack, my putrid scent splatoon!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Eat splinters, ugly! ''[throws barrels at the monster then trips]''}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. monster: ''[Takes off its head to dodge the barrel and crushes the second and eat it then roars]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[watering the ground until the hose stops spraying water. He peeks inside and it sprays water at him]''}}
{{L|Plankton|This is your last chance Eugene! Give up the formula or else!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Or else what?}}
{{L|Plankton|Or else this! ''[C.H.U.M. monster crushes the table]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Alright, alright! I'll give you what you want! Just please don't hurt me. SpongeBob, help! ''[Mr. Krabs runs out of the Krusty Krab]'' SpongeBob! ''[puts a garbage bin behind the C.H.U.M. monster]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Stop him! ''[C.H.U.M. monster eats Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, a penny! ''[points the hose up]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Not again! ''[He and the C.H.U.M. monster get washed down the sewer]'' Aah!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh! I'm so sorry, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[carries SpongeBob and spins him around]'' My little hero! ''[smooches his nose]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! ''[giggles, bubble wipe to the next scene]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, thanks for trying anyway. So, uh, you guys wanna hang out? You know, uh, maybe worship me a little more?}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|No, we think C.H.U.M. happier in the sewer. Too crazy up here.}}
{{L|Plankton|But you'll keep worshipping me, right?}}
{{L|C.H.U.M. Leader|We check our schedule. Get back to you. ''[flushes themselves down]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[groans sadly as the episode ends]''}}
