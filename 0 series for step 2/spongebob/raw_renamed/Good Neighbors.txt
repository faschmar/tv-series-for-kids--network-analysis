{{L|''[Everyone is sleeping until SpongeBob's foghorn alarm wakes Squidward up.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good morning, Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sarcastically]'' Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for.}}
{{L|Squidward|You did overlook one teensy little detail, however.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's that, Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|It's Sunday! ''[angrily kicks SpongeBob out of his house]'' A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. ''[He sees a stack of newspapers up the lawn]'' He forgot his Sunday papers. ''[walks up to them]'' This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him. ''[breaks the string that holds the paper together]'' Man, this is heavy. ''[The paper falls to the ground and SpongeBob puts it together as a paper ball]'' ''[bumps into Patrick]'' Oh, pardon me.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, watch where you're going. ''[screams]'' Newspaper monster!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[throws paper in the air, screaming]'' Monster! ''[both scream and run around]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[opens the window; not knowing they have his Sunday papers]'' Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! ''[goes back inside]'' I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday. ''[Bubble transition to him in the living room; hums]'' My Sunday relaxation kit. ''[reaches into box]'' Let's see…pillow. ''[puts pillow on end of couch]'' Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance. ''[sprays fragrance on flower. The flower dies. Squidward sniffs and sighs.]'' And the final touch. ''[dials on phone]'' Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, the pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4, my good man. ''[hangs up phone]'' Ah, this is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot. ''[grabs a box]'' Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder. Take me on a chocolate vacation. ''[SpongeBob & Patrick raise up from behind the couch making noises and with spinning fezzes. Squidward spits out his chocolate and growls.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob & Patrick|''[singing a deep note]'' By the all seeing eye. Ye are worthy, we are not.}}
{{L|Squidward|What are you two idiots doing?}}
{{L|Patrick|Secret ritual.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|To inaugurate you as president.}}
{{L|Squidward|Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses.}}
{{L|Patrick|No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better.}}
{{L|Squidward|Better?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're the president of 'The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge'.}}
{{L|Squidward|The what? Is this some stupid club you two made up? ''[SpongeBob & Patrick gasp and then laugh]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Maybe. ''[both laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's a secret. ''[both laugh]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Fine! As my first presidential decree, uhh, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer? ''[pushing SpongeBob & Patrick out the door]'' Now out, out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays. ''[closes the door, screams when SpongeBob & Patrick appear from inside]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What color should we paint the leaves, your presidentialocity?}}
{{L|Squidward|Ahh! Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore.}}
{{L|SpongeBob & Patrick|Wow. Polka dots.}}
{{L|Patrick|Our new president is a genius.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah. ''[both laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob & Patrick|See ya later, Squidward.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[now outside, a red paint can drops on the ground]'' Whenever you're ready, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Patrick unscrews SpongeBob's hat which turns out to be a screw]'' Hold still, buddy. ''[pours the red paint inside SpongeBob's hole. When he is done, he throws the can away and ends up hitting an elderly citizen Lonnie riding a bike. Patrick screws the hat back in.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, Pat, gimme a quick shake.}}
{{L|Patrick|Okie dokie. ''[Patrick shakes SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay! I'm ready! ''[Patrick grabs SpongeBob's arm and uses it like a slot machine. Drops of red paint come shooting out of SpongeBob's holes and onto the trees.]'' Hey, that worked perfectly. C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[clock on wall is ringing noon]'' Oh, no. It's already noon. I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday.}}
{{L|SpongeBob & Patrick|''[singing outside of Squidward's window]'' Good neighbors are we. La-la-la-la-laa-la.}}
{{L|Squidward|What's going on out there?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, President Squidward. Almost done painting… ''[Patrick pulls on SpongeBob's arm which makes the paint shoot out his holes and all over Squidward's face and in his eyes]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[screams]'' My eyes! ''[continues screaming as he runs around bumping into stuff. Runs outside and in front of a car.]''}}
{{L|Gale Rechid|Look out! ''[car slams on brakes and stops in front of Squidward]''}}
{{L|Frank (red shirt)|Oh, you poor man.}}
{{L|Gale Rechid|You must be very sick. Let us take you to the hospital.}}
{{L|Squidward|No really, I'm fine. Please, I…no, I’m f-fine. ''[mumbles]'' ''[Frank and Gale put Squidward in the back seat and drive off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob & Patrick|See ya later, neighbor!}}
{{L|Patrick|It is a lovely day for a ride in the country.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, our president sure knows how to live. ''[later]'' I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick. ''[Patrick is snoring]'' OK…Squidward? ''[Squidward's chair is empty]'' Squidward? Squidward, you home?}}
{{L|Patrick|Did you find him, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive.}}
{{L|Patrick|Or maybe he's on a secret mission.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I hope he's not in danger.}}
{{L|Patrick|Danger?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger.}}
{{L|Harold (red fish)|Excuse me? Somebody ordered a relaxing pedicure and foot massage? The Sunday special?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to. ''[SpongeBob & Patrick are laughing inside Squidward's house. Squidward opens his front door]'' What are you two doing in my house?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin.}}
{{L|Patrick|I say he checks out a-ok.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips? ''[shows foot with long toenails]''}}
{{L|Squidward|French tips, huh? ''[pushes SpongeBob and Patrick's chair out of the way]'' Alright, pal, make with the relaxing foot massage, pronto!}}
{{L|Harold (red fish)|Uh-oh. Um...no, Sorry. Your hour's up. [packed up and leave]}}
{{L|Squidward|''[He shockedly twitches his eye. As SpongeBob happily wiggles his toes, he angrily makes way toward the front door, opens it and points his finger outside]'' Alright, you two! Out! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick, realizing that they are in trouble, slowly walk out]'' And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day! Or tomorrow! Or next week!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, does that include…?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[angrily screams]'' Yes, it does!}} <font color="red">''[furiously slams the door]''{{L|SpongeBob| Gee, Patrick. Do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[furiously smashes his head through the door, screaming]'' Yes, I was! You call yourselves good neighbors?! You're the worst neighbors ever! ''[deep breath]'' You don't deserve to wear those fezzes! ''[furiously takes SpongeBob and Patrick's fezzes, angrily grits his teeth and angrily stomps them into the ground]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gee, Pat, maybe President Squidward's right.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, I guess we aren't good neighbors after all.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[pops back out through the hole of his front door, screaming with rage]'' No, you aren't! You're horrible neighbors! ''[angrily hyperventilates]'' And stop calling me president!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|C'mon, let's go. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick sadly walk away]''}}</font>
{{L|Squidward|There are only 3 hours of my Sunday left. They took it all away. I didn't even get to read the Sunday paper. ''[notices pile of paper on the ground with a note on it]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''['Here's Your Sunday Paper Squidward. Enjoy. Love, SpongeBob.']}}
{{L|''[Squidward steams up furiously, kicks the paper into the air, then growls like a dog. Then he takes a paper off his head.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Good neighbors, my right. ''[reads paper]'' Hello? "Keep Out Intruders For Good! New Security System 5000. Free Installation" ''[Squidward does an evil laugh. Later, he has the security system built in and turned on.]''}}
{{L|Security System|System activated.}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, that oughta do it. Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[he with Patrick, with their fezzes back on, walk up to Squidward]'' President Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[screams]'' What the…?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We hereby present you with this delicious cake.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[reads writing on cake]'' "Sorry for bugging you so much"? What the…? Security system, help! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! What's the matter with you?!}}
{{L|Security System|No threat detected.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[angry, banging on security system]'' Oh! You infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrapheap you came from!}}
{{L|Security System|Threat detected. ''[Squidward screaming while the system shoots a laser at him which makes SpongeBob & Patrick's cake fly into the air and land on the system, causing it to go haywire.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Now, what's going on?}}
{{L|Security System|Threat detected. Code red! Code red!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughing as fireworks are shooting out all over Squidward's house]'' It's like a carnival ride.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[running around]'' Run for your lives! ''[Squidward's house suddenly grows legs and arms and stands up. Then grabs Squidward from inside. He yells.]'' What the…?! What are you doing?!'' [Squidward's house kicks him into the air and walks off, Squidward trembles in fear and he holds himself together]'' I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. ''[gasps]'' Ooh, just what I've been waiting for. ''[laughs hysterically]'' I am gonna relax… if it kills me. ''[takes a deep breath]'' Ahhh!}}
{{L|''[Meanwhile, Squidward's house is on a rampage while people are screaming]''}}
{{L|Army|Fire! ''[The tank fires a missile at the house, but the house catches the missile and flicks it away. Then the house grabs the tank, squishes it, and throws it away.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Wow. Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We gotta turn this thing off. ''[turns on a light switch]'' Nope, not it.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[flushes the toilet]'' Nope.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[turns on the fan]'' Nope.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[pushes the toaster button down]'' That's not it, either.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[still resting]'' This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot. ''[house stands right above Squidward]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmmm, where to look. ''[notices an "off button" on the wall]'' Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious. ''[pushes button and house sits on top of Squidward and goes back to normal]'' We did it, Patrick! ''[Squidward busts through from beneath the floor]'' President Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[calmly]'' No-no, don't say anything more. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now, if you'll be so kind to leave so that I can get ready for work tomorrow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. President...}}
{{L|Squidward|Shush.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But, we just wanted to...}}
{{L|Squidward|''[yells in their faces angrily]'' Get out of my house! ''[notices an angry mob surrounding his house]'' Huh?}}
{{L|''[As soon as SpongeBob and Patrick flee from Squidward, a whole angry mob: Larry the Lobster, Lou, Mable-Monica, Lenny, Henry-Bart, Paco, an anchovy, Molly, Shubie, Martin, three Officer Slugfish, Harv, Scooter, Thaddeus, Nazz-Mimi, two Nat Peterson's, Sadie Rechid, Nathiel Waters, Mable (gray), and two police boats appear outside Squidward's house.]''}}
{{L|Scooter|There he is!}}
{{L|Mr. Poecilia|''[walks up to Squidward]'' Are you the owner of this house?}}
{{L|Squidward|Yes! Yes, I am!}}
{{L|Mr. Poecilia|[his eyes turned bloodshot when he gets angry] Then on behalf the citizens of Bikini Bottom, I present you with this summons to pay for the destruction of our town. ''[hands Squidward the summons]'' You'll be doing community service every Sunday for the rest of your life. ''[walks off]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Huh? [twitches his left eye and looks at the camera]}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too? ''[SpongeBob & Patrick walk up with a summons in their hands]'' This'll be great. The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, President Squidward.}}
