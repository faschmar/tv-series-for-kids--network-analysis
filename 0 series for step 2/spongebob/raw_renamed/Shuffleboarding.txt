{{L|Mermaid Man|Keep on your guard, Barnacle Boy! They're getting ready for another attack!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Those aren't super villains. It's just that kid, uh, SpongeBob and his goofy friend. Hey, kid, can you give us our Mermarang back? We only got the one.}}

{{L|Mermaid Man|Nice shot!}}
{{L|Patrick|Wow! That Mermarang really likes you!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I know!}}

{{L|SpongeBob|''[Preparing to catch the Mermerang once again]'' I've got it! ''[The Mermarang flies past SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Runaway Mermarang!}}
{{L|''[PANIC! All the old people start running around creating chaos.. The Mermarang hits Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy again. Both of them fall back on their couch and are dumped into the Mermalair. SpongeBob and Patrick follow]''}}

{{L|Barnacle Boy|So?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're also certified Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy impersonators. ''[turns the card around]''}}

{{L|Mermaid Man|You can't argue with certification!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Ohhhh... All right. I suppose they can't do too much damage. It's just shuffle boarding... umph!}}
