{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[holds up a green trash bag that is leaking green ooze]'' SpongeBob, take this bag of moldy sponges out to the garbage, will ya?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Eww. ''[trips over a bucket]'' Whoa! ''[he flies out the door, covered in the moldy green sponges, and gasps. Then he looks up at the green moon, as a coyote howls as SpongeBob's body turns teal green]'' What's happening to me? ''[mushrooms grow out of the side of his body; his eyelashes grow extra long and he laughs evilly]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I thought I told SpongeBob to throw these moldy sponges away. ''[throws SpongeBob in the dumpster and closes the lid, the lid re-opens as SpongeBob groans, annoyed]''}}
