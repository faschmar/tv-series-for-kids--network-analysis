{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hi, uh...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick stare at each other for about 30 seconds, blinking occasionally]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You wanna play hide-and-seek?}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay! I figure that that spot over there by those rocks is a good place to-}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah...?}}
{{L|Patrick|Do I have to know what hide-and-seek is in order to play it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' C'mon, Patrick, quit fooling around! We've played hide-and-seek dozens of times!}}
{{L|Patrick|Dozens?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thousands!}}
{{L|Patrick|Thousands?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I don't know for sure how many I...}}
{{L|Patrick|Gosh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gosh what?}}
{{L|Patrick|I didn't know hide-and-seek had so much mathematics.}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition changes the scene]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, it's simple. ''[stands behind a rock]'' A person stands behind a rock, like this. ''[covers his eyes]'' Then they cover their eyes. ''[uncovers one of his eyes]'' And count while the other person runs and hides!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, you're peeking!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I thought you said you didn't know how to play.}}
{{L|Patrick|Play what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hide-and-seek!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I do! I do know how to play!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, good!}}
{{L|Patrick|I- I just have one tiny question.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's that?}}
{{L|Patrick|What's hide-and-seek? ''[Bubble transition changes the scene]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[with socks on his hands]'' You think you're getting it now, Patrick? Did you find the sock puppet demonstration to be useful?}}
{{L|Patrick|Hide-and-seek: a game played by two or more players in which one player chosen at random counts aloud to a pre-determined number while the remaining players hide. Upon reaching said number, the counting player now embarks on a search for the other players. ''[SpongeBob takes his socks off his hands and puts them back on his feet]'' The search continues until all players are located and a winner is determined.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, you really are getting it!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hide-and-seek sure sounds fun, ''[gets choked up]'' I just wish I could play! ''[starts crying]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Patrick, come on. Of course we can play!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh no! I can't! ''[sobbing in despair]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why can't you?}}
{{L|Patrick|Because... I don't have any socks! ''[bawls uncontrollably]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick, forget about the socks.}}
{{L|Patrick|What socks?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Never mind, just start counting.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[covers his eyes]'' One, two, three... ''[continues counting]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's perfect! Now I'm gonna run and hide.}}
{{L|Patrick|Seven, eight...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now I'm all over, where am I gonna hide? ''[looks to the right, then the left]'' Hmmm. ''[lifts his finger up, then puts his finger in his mouth and sticks out his tongue before licking his finger and puts the finger in and out]'' That's definitely one idea.}}
{{L|Patrick|Seventy-eight, seventy-nine, a hundred! Four! A-ha! I found you. I win, I win, I win! In your face! ''[pokes SpongeBob in the face]'' I must be the best hide-and-seek player ever!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|All right, it's my turn to count. You know what you're supposed to do right?}}
{{L|Patrick|Of course! I'm the best hide-and-seek player ever aren't I?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Right. Here I go. ''[covers eyes]'' One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...}}
{{L|Patrick|''[thinking]'' Do you hear that? No, what is that? Oh, it's SpongeBob. Why is he counting? I guess I'll just go home, maybe or later he'll want to play a game, or something.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty... ''[Patrick lifts up his rock and jumps in]'' Ninety-nine, ''[uncovers eyes]'' a hundred! Now where is he hiding? ''[looks at Patrick's rock]'' Nah, way too obvious. ''[walks away, little realizing that Patrick was taking out his trash]'' Come out, come out wherever you are! ''[looks behind kelp and through a rock, but the rock is upside down a flower springs behind him]'' Patrick! ''[sees something that looks like Patrick's head, sticking out of the ground]'' Patrick! ''[lifts his head up, but it is brain coral]'' This is gonna be harder than I thought.}}
{{L|Squidward|La da dee, la da dum, la da doo... ''[reaches for his keys]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward! ''[Squidward is rummaging now]'' SQUIDWARRRD! ''[Squidward is flicking]'' Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|No! ''[flicks through carrots]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward! ''[Squidward tries to get in the house, but the key snaps, meaning he is stuck with SpongeBob, then screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[yelling]'' What?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm playing hide-and-seek with Patrick and I was wondering if I could search for him in your house.}}
{{L|Squidward|No.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay. See ya, bye.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Patty's kr- ''[bangs into a letter]'' What the... ''[an A falls near him]'' Time for the shelter! Doomsday came sooner than I thought.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, how do they know my name?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, up here!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob? What are you doing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm playing hide-and-seek with Patrick. I thought I'd look for him on this sign.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob! That makes me furious!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll clean it up.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It's not that! It's just that you haven't paid the fee.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The fee?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah, you know. The Krusty Krab Hide-and-Go Seekers' Fee. For playing hide-and-seek on Krusty Krab premises.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, that one. I almost forgot. ''[throws coins into Mr. Krabs' chest]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Okay! Good luck finding him!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks Mr. Krabs! Darn it! ''[cut scene to boating school and the bell rings. SpongeBob is looking under boats]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Where could that awful noise be coming from? It's been going on for hours now. SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, Mrs. Puff.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|What are you doing? My class can hardly hear me teach.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm trying to lift this boat. I think Patrick's hiding underneath it.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Why would he be doing that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Because we're playing hide-and-seek. Wanna play?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Me? Why, no, I couldn't.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you sure?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Yes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you sure you're sure?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Yes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you sure you're sure you're sure?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Yes I'm sure.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you sure you're sure you're sure you're sure?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Yes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you sure you're sure you're sure you're sure you're sure?...}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Actually, SpongeBob, I will play. ''[lifts up the boat and throws it, creating a fire]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nope, he's not under there. Thanks for checking under your car, Mrs. Puff.}}
{{L|Sandy|Yes? ''[SpongeBob rushes through the door]'' SpongeBob? What are you doing with that magnifying glass?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Looking for Patrick. I've been seeking and seeking all day, but I can't find him.}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh, that's terrible news.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I know.}}
{{L|Sandy|Come on. You ain't gonna find him with that drab little thing. I've got something better. ''[pushes a button and a submarine comes up]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow. Are you sure it's okay for me to use this?}}
{{L|Sandy|I keep this thing here for emergencies. This is an emergency. Right, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes. Yes, absolutely. ''[climbs into the submarine]'' Thanks again, Sandy.}}
{{L|Sandy|Be careful! ''[a hole breaks in treedome. SpongeBob searches everywhere. Cut scene to map of Bikini Bottom]'' }}
{{L|SpongeBob|Darn it. "Welcome to the end of the world, caf√© and gift shop". ''[walks in]''}}
{{L|Waiter|May I help you, son?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm looking for my friend, Patrick.}}
{{L|Waiter|You mean a big mouthish fellow with a pointy head?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Exactly.}}
{{L|Waiter|I have not seen him.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh. Oh, well, thanks anyway.}}
{{L|Waiter|Wait! Is he pink?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah.}}
{{L|Waiter|Well, in that case, he's sitting right over there.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't believe it! Patrick, it really is you.}}
{{L|Patrick Not-Star|My name is Patrick. ''[turns around]'' Patrick Not-Star.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick Not-Star? Oh, no! ''[starts crying]'' You aren't the one I'm seeking! Now I'll never find Patrick! He wins at hide and seek! He wins, he wins!}}
{{L|Patrick Not-Star|So he wins. What's so bad about that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, if he wins, I lose.}}
{{L|Patrick Not-Star|Did you have fun playing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah.}}
{{L|Patrick Not-Star|Well, then, it's okay to lose, as long as you have fun doing it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, you're right! Thanks, Patrick Not-Star.}}
{{L|Patrick Not-Star|Just one more thing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's that?}}
{{L|Patrick Not-Star|Do you have a dollar I can borrow?}}
{{L|''[cuts to SpongeBob leaving a note outside Patrick's house; the rock opens to reveal Patrick.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick! You were under there the whole time?}}
{{L|Patrick|Under where?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I was just leaving this note for you.}}
{{L|Patrick|"Dear Patrick: I couldn't find you so you win. But that's okay, because I still had fun playing. You are truly the greatest hide-and-seek player in the whole world. Love, SpongeBob." Thanks, SpongeBob. That really means a lot.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it.}}
{{L|Patrick|I still have one question.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ask away.}}
{{L|Patrick|What's hide and seek?}}
