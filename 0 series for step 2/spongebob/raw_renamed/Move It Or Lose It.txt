{{L|''[The scene begins with a boat driving up to the intersection between the Chum Bucket and the Krusty Krab. A bureaucrat fish steps out of the car and places a stake into the street. He then places two signs on both of the hangers.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[inside the Krusty Krab]'' Hmm. What could be the doings of this stranger?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[inside the Chum Bucket]'' This looks suspicious.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs and Plankton|''[both step out of their restaurants toward the male fish]'' What's the big idea?}}
{{L|State Officer|Mr. Eugene Krabs and Sheldon Plankton?}}
{{L|Plankton and Mr. Krabs|Yes?}}
{{L|State Officer|These are for you. ''[walks away. They both look at the two signs]''}}
{{L|Plankton and Mr. Krabs|''[reading the signs]'' "Updated city ordinance: Fast Food Restaurants cannot be within 100 feet of each other". Huh?}}
{{L|State Officer|The Krusty Krab and The Chum Bucket are located too close together. One of your restaurants is going to have to be bulldozed. }}
{{L|Plankton and Mr. Krabs|''[in shock]'' B - B - B - Bulldozed!? ''[measure the distance between the two restaurants with Tape Measures]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[in shock]'' 99 feet!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sad]'' It's true!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[letting go of the tape measure]'' Ah! ''[crashes into a pole]'' Oof!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[suspicious]'' Which one of us is gonna get bulldozed?}}
{{L|State Officer|That's for you two to decide.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[angry]'' I'm not going anywhere! You're the one who is moving!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[angry]'' You are moving!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ohoho! No, you are!}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, no I'm not!}}
{{L|State Officer|''[interrupts them]'' Gentlemen, you have 24 hours to decide which of you moves. That's the law around here! ''[drives off]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[angry]'' Pack your bags pipsqueak!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[angry]'' You might as well close up shop right now, Krabs. Your customers won't miss a thing.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' At least I have customers.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[angry]'' Oh yeah!? Well I'm gonna put together a... uh... a petition of customer signatures.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ha! Good luck with that ludicrous idea! ''[walks to the Krusty Krab]''. ''[confused]'' Petition? ''[walks through the doors]'' Squidward! SpongeBob!}}
{{L|''[Squidward puts magazine down]'' ''[SpongeBob zooms to Mr. Krabs while Squidward walks]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[hands petitions to SpongeBob and Squidward]'' You two take these petitions to save The Krusty Krab and secure as many signatures as you can!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[saluting]'' Sir, yes, sir!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sarcastic]'' Oh yeah, I'm definitely gonna do this.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[signing]'' And I'm gonna be the first signature. There and how about you Squidward? Could we count on your support? ''[in shock to see Squidward gone and the petition still there]'' Squidward?}}
{{L|''[Bubble transition to Mrs. Puffs Boating School]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hello, Mrs. Puff!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[frightened]'' No! Stay away! I can't afford to go back in the slammer!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm just here if you would sign this petition. It'll save the Krusty Krab from getting bulldozed!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Why would I care about that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' Mrs. Puff, don't you care what happens to Mr. Krabs? Squidward? Gary? Me?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Not particularly.}}
{{L|Delivery Man|''[walks in the classroom]'' Excuse me? I'm looking for a Mrs. Puff.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Yes, that's me.}}
{{L|Delivery Man|Your new boat's here. Just sign here, please. ''[Mrs. Puff signs the paper]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Speaking of signatures, would you sign this petition to save the Krusty Krab? ''[hands out a piece of paper]''}}
{{L|Delivery Man|Why would I care about the Krusty Krab? ''[annoyed]'' I'll unload the boat. ''[SpongeBob and the delivery man both walk out of the classroom. SpongeBob notices something about the boat.]'' ''[closeup of the boat's lever]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, Mr. Delivery Man. I got this. ''[pushes down the boat's lever. It moves backwards, heading straight towards the school. Mrs. Puff notices this.]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Noooo! ''[closes the door, when the boat crashes into the school. Mrs. Puff puffs up.]''}}
{{L|''[bubble transition to SpongeBob walking on the street]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[comes to a repair man close to a boat, who looks at a piece of paper]'' Excuse me, sir. Would you like to sign a petition to save the Krusty Krab?}}
{{L|Repair Man|''[confused]'' Why would I want to do that? The food there is dangerous. ''[closeup of the paper that says, "Krabby Patties are Dangerous" as SpongeBob reads it]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[worried]'' Sir, where did you get this?}}
{{L|Repair Man|It was on my windshield. They're all over the place! ''[even more copies of the paper are attached to buildings]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This must be Plankton's dirty plan. ''[cut to SpongeBob running towards the Krusty Krab]'' Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! ''[As he enters, many people with papers all talking at once angrily to Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Nat|Hey, Mr. Krabs! Why are your patties dangerous?}}
{{L|Everyone|Yeah! ''[keep talking at once]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[worried]'' I...I...uh... My...my patties are dangerous because...because they're so...uh...uh...they're so-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[comes out of the kitchen with a plate of Krabby Patties]'' Delicious!}}
{{L|Nat|''[as everyone else stares]'' Kid's got a point. ''[Everyone talks at once happily. They start taking the patties.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[leans closer to SpongeBob]'' Thanks for saving me shell, boy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't thank me, Mr. Krabs. Thank the Krabby Patty.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[growls, then returns to the Chum Bucket teary-eyed]'' That does it!}}
{{L|Karen|Throwing in the napkin, are we?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[sobs loudly onto a suitcase before speaking tearfully]'' My restaurant. My laboratory. My evil inventions. All about to be flattened! Just give me a moment to say my goodbyes. ''[walks sadly by his former things while dragging his suitcase]'' Farewell, stench-vision goggles. Farewell, Chum Bucket replicator. Farewell, hypnotizer helmet. We had some diabolical times together, didn't we? ''[walks to a cannon]'' So long, sonic cannon that destroys every known material in the universe. ''[weeps onto the cannon's button, accidentally activating it so it burns a hole through the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob sees this while humming on the street and hears Plankton crying, tears up himself, and finds him sobbing while laying down.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sadly]'' Plankton, I'm sorry. ''[sniffs]'' Sorry I made my Krabby Patty so delicious. ''[sobs]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[stops crying and gets up angrily]'' Hey, get lost! I'm the only one that weeps around here.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But I can't help it think that I somehow had a hand in your misery. Or at least a spatula. Nobody would sign a petition to bulldoze the Krusty Krab unless you pay them. And who would be low enough to do that?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[smiles, closes a door, then chuckles evilly]'' Karen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?}}
{{L|Karen|Before you start buying up those petition signatures, you should know that our checking account balance is ''[shown on her screen]'' negative $375.}}
{{L|Plankton|Not to worry, my lady. I have a plan.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[cut to him looking through a telescope]'' Hmm... Now there's something you don't see every day.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[serves Krabby Patties to a three-headed fish]'' Three-Headed Jake? He comes in every day.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Not him. I'm referring to the large crowd gathered at the Chum Bucket. It appears they are actually giving Plankton... money?! ''[A customer gives Plankton money while wearing the hypnotizer helmet from earlier.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|You just got a steal, sir. You'll get many villainous years out of that little number. ''[chuckles evilly, then jumps up to put the money in the cash register]'' I'll forget this restaurant nonsense, Karen. I should've opened a yard sale business years ago. ''[Fish look at stuff.]'' Step up, fishes. Every evil invention is price to move!}}
{{L|Charlie|I'll take this riptide generator off your hands! ''[gives Plankton money]''}}
{{L|Nat|''[wears the goggles from earlier.]'' I'll give you $1,000 for the stench-vision goggles. ''[puts the money on Plankton's antennas]''}}
{{L|Pilar|''[points at Karen]'' Hey, how much for the computer?}}
{{L|Plankton|How much you got?}}
{{L|Karen|''[angry]'' Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|All right. My wife's not for sale. ''[to everyone]'' But everything else must go! ''[Everyone cheers and gives Plankton even more money, smiling. Plankton sticks his head out of the stack.]'' Well, wifey. Looks like it's time to proceed to the next phase. ''[As he pulls a rope, the sign changes from "Yard Sale" to "$ for your signature".]'' ''[through a megaphone, holding a dollar]'' Who wants free money? ''[Everyone notices.]''}}
{{L|Dennis|''[turns his head]'' Free?!}}
{{L|Debbie|''[also turns her head]'' Money?! ''[Everyone happily runs to the stand.]''}}
{{L|Nat|Free money! ''[Angrily, he turns a boat to the other side then joins everyone else. The boat catches on fire and explodes.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Everyone crowds around him.]'' Okay, okay. One at a time, please. ''[holding a dollar]'' To receive your free money, ''[holding a piece of paper attached to a clipboard]'' just sign this petition to save the Chum Bucket.}}
{{L|Pilar|Ooh, ooh. Me first. ''[As he signs the petition, Plankton gives him a dollar, then laughs evilly.]'' Yeah!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[walks in the Krusty Krab, angry.]'' This is outrageous! ''[to SpongeBob]'' You see what Plankton's doing, don't ya? He's undermining the democratic process by lab raging his temporarily financial windfall in order to buy every signature in Bikini Bottom. ''[counts his change]'' There's 20, 40, 50... We just bought mine 4 times! And me tasty food is one thing. ''[points out the window]'' But how can I compete with free money? ''[sad]'' I'm doomed! Well... clean around, boy. Border up. I'm afraid we're closing up for good. ''[sobs while biting his finger]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sad]'' Mr. Krabs is hurt so much!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[laughs hysterically]'' Whoo... priceless.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[meanwhile, as everyone cheers...]'' ''[happily]'' Thank you, thank you! I've got what I need! ''[holding up the clipboard and paper]'' I got the signatures! ''[confused while looking at the paper]'' All but one. Guess I won't be hiring the yellow sponge anytime soon. ''[evilly happily]'' But none of that matters now! Cause the majority is on my side! Which in a democracy is all you need.}}
{{L|''[Meanwhile, cut to SpongeBob putting mayonnaise in a box, then taping it up, then cut to Mr. Krabs putting down a clock as a bulldozer arrives.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sad]'' It's time. ''[goes outside on the street and waits for the truck to stop in front of him.]''}}
{{L|State Officer|''[puts one of the bulldozer's windows down]'' So, who's getting bulldozed today?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[with the clipboard]'' Oh, not me, your bureaucraticness. I completed my petition. ''[Mr. Krabs is worried.]''}}
{{L|State Officer|The people have spoken. Step aside, Mr. Krabs. ''[Part of the bulldozer smokes fire out.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But... but... ''[As he backs up, the bulldozer follows him, towards the Krusty Krab.]'' ''[angry]'' No! I'm not going anywhere!}}
{{L|State Officer|Please comply, Mr. Krabs. It'll be quick and painless.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|If you wanna bulldoze me restaurant, ''[locks himself up]'' it's gonna be long and painful!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[is seen at the top of the restaurant, also locked up]'' ''[angry]'' Stand your ground, Mr. Krabs! We are right behind you, right, Squidward? ''[The lock is empty.]'' Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[He is outside his home, with an umbrella on top of him, sitting on a chair, and drinking a cup of tea, happily.]''}}
{{L|State Officer|''[moves his bulldozer closer to the restaurant.]'' Okay, now this is really your last chance.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[still angry]'' I'm never leaving the Krusty Krab!}}
{{L|State Officer|Fine. Have it your way. ''[pushes a lever.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[chuckles evilly, while setting up himself a movie theater seat, then sits on it.]'' Bring it on! Bring the destruction! ''[munches on popcorn]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[Part of the bulldozer smokes more fire out, and the bulldozer starts to move even closer to the restaurant.]'' ''[sad]'' Goodbye, Krusty Krab! ''[As he closes his eyes, the bulldozer begins to move the restaurant, but only moves 1 foot.]'' ''[confused]'' Eh?}}
{{L|State Officer|Thank you for your cooperation.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[spits the popcorn out, angry]'' What?! Excuse me, sir, but, uh... ''[stands on the seat]'' you forgot to level the place!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[confused]'' Uhh... yeah.}}
{{L|State Officer|Demolition is outside of my purview. I simply ensure that restaurants comply with the 100 foot ordinance. ''[measures the distance with a tape measure and says the 1 foot on it.]'' That's 1 more foot. Perfect! ''[walks away from the restaurant.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[jumping on the seat, still angry]'' But that's not fair! ''[He slips inside and the seat closes on him.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So you're not gonna destroy the Krusty Krab?}}
{{L|State Officer|No...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[jumps inside the bulldozer, hugging the bureaucrat fish.]'' Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! ''[As the bureaucrat fish accidentally pulls the lever, the truck goes backwards. He and SpongeBob look out the window.]'' Oh, dear. ''[The bulldozer crashes through the Chum Bucket, destroying it.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Meanwhile, he's free from the seat after struggling to.]'' ''[still angry]'' Come on! Let's do this! I wanna see some destruction! ''[As he gasps, he finally sees the destroyed Chum Bucket.]'' I think I've seen enough. ''[goes back inside the seat]''}}
