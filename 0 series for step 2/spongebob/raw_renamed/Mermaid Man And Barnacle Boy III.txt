{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|TV Announcer|The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join Bikini Bottom's noblest, boldest, oldest superheroes as they bravely prepare for vacation. ''[both pack their clothes into their bags while the words "FOLD" and "PACK" come up]'' But wait! While our heroes relax at Leisure Village, who will watch the Mermalair? ''[Barnacle Boy opens the doors and SpongeBob and Patrick jump in]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|ManSponge...}}
{{L|Patrick|...and BoyPatrick...}}
{{L|Both|Reporting for duty!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Yeah, yeah, follow me.}}
{{L|Both|Up, up, and away!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Evil!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Now, we want you boys to keep an eye on the place. Water the plants, and make sure that...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, my gosh, Patrick! This is the greatest wall of superhero secret gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!}}
{{L|Patrick|I get the Aqua-Glove!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Hold on there, boys! You cannot play with this stuff!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What about the Orb of Confusion? ''[turns the orb on and makes confused faces]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|''[turns it off]'' No, no! Prolonged exposure to the Orb of Confusion will give you... uh... confusion!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[opens the boat's door]'' What about the Invisible Boatmobile?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Especially not the Invisible Boatmobile! ''[closes the boat's door]'' When we say don't touch anything, we mean ''don't touch anything''! Do you understand?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|[salutes] Loud and clear, trusted boy companion!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Well, great. Here are the keys. ''[SpongeBob takes the key from his hand]'' We'll see you in a week.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|''[both run out the door]'' Up, up, and away!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come, BoyPatrick, while our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay! ''[both flip into the other room while letting out battle cries]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Huh? Muh-muh-muh-ma-muh-muh-ma-muh-ma...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What is it, trusted sidekick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Muh-muh-muh-ma-muh-muh-ma-muh-ma! Muh-muh-muh-ma-muh-muh-ma-muh-ma!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Muh-muh-muh-ma-muh-muh-ma-muh-ma! Muh-muh-muh-ma-muh-muh-ma-muh-ma! Man Ray! ''[both scream, then hide]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Looks like he's frozen or something.}}
{{L|Patrick|Fruh-fruh-fruh-fro-fruh-fruh-fro-fruh-fro...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It appears to be some sort of prison chamber... ''[licks the chamber]'' ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible! Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him! ''[Patrick pulls the lever down to UNFREEZE]'' Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!}}
{{L|Patrick|But you said you had a question.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We could get in trouble!}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, that's not a question. ''[they both argue when Man Ray's eyes start to light up]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|They said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! ''[pulls level up back to FREEZE]''}}
{{L|Man Ray|I'm free! Hahaha!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.}}
{{L|Man Ray|By the supreme authority of wickedness, I, the evil Man Ray, command you to release me from this frozen prison at once!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that.}}
{{L|Man Ray|Why... Not?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Because you're evil!}}
{{L|Man Ray|You mean, if I was good, then you'd let me go?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, sure, why not?}}
{{L|Man Ray|Then, uh, in that case... I am good.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Really?}}
{{L|Man Ray|Yes, really.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Really, really?}}
{{L|Man Ray|Yes, yes, really, really.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Really, really, really?}}
{{L|Man Ray|Yes, yes, already! I'm good! I'm good! Now let me out of here or you'll suffer dire consequences!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, that's good enough for me. ''[SpongeBob pulls the lever back to "UNFREEZE" Man Ray is unfrozen and falls to the ground]''}}
{{L|Man Ray|You fools! Prepare to be eradicated! ''[tries to jump at SpongeBob and Patrick but stops in mid-air and falls to the ground then laughs]'' What's wrong with me? Hahaha! What is this...Hahaha...infernal contraption?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17!}}
{{L|Narrator|''[showing a picture of the belt]'' As seen in episode #17!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, I love that episode.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, me too, me too!}}
{{L|Man Ray|I'll never get out of here wearing this belt! ''[chuckles]'' I... I need an evil plan that will trick them to take it off me. ''[chuckles again]'' Time for those acting lessons to pay off.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...}}
{{L|Man Ray|Oh, boohoo! Oh, sob! Oh, cry! ''[opens and closes his eyes]'' Oh, woe is me! You don't know what it's like being evil for so long. Oh, how I wish to be... good. If only some kind heroes would show me the path to decency. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go!}}
{{L|Man Ray|''[turns around]'' Ahh, that would be fantastic! ''[chuckles]'' I'll fake my way through this just like I did in high school. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready for your first day at goodness school? ''[Man Ray puts an apple on his desk]'' Pat, get your wallet out. ''[Patrick gets his wallet out of his pocket]'' Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet. ''[Patrick tosses it on the ground]'' Now, what do you do?}}
{{L|Man Ray|Excuse me, sir, but I do believe you've dropped your wallet.}}
{{L|Patrick|Doesn't look familiar to me.}}
{{L|Man Ray|What? I just saw you drop it. Here.}}
{{L|Patrick|Nope, it's not mine.}}
{{L|Man Ray|It is yours. I am trying to be a good person and return it to you.}}
{{L|Patrick|Return what to who?}}
{{L|Man Ray|''[facepalms, then shows Patrick his ID]'' Aren't you Patrick Star?}}
{{L|Patrick|Yup.}}
{{L|Man Ray|And this is your ID.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yup.}}
{{L|Man Ray|I found this ID in this wallet. And if that's the case, this must be your wallet.}}
{{L|Patrick|That makes sense to me.}}
{{L|Man Ray|Then take it.}}
{{L|Patrick|It's not my wallet.}}
{{L|Man Ray|''[in anger and frustration]'' '''You dim bulb! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off!''' ''[SpongeBob pushes tickle button and Man Ray laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah-ah! Wrong. ''[SpongeBob pushes button]'' Good people don't rip other people's arms off! ''[Man Ray chuckles]'' Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?}}
{{L|Man Ray|Hello, friend. I noticed you were struggling with that package. Would you like some help with... ''[Patrick drops package on Man Ray's foot]'' Ow!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oops, sorry. Can I start over?}}
{{L|Man Ray|I noticed you was... ''[Patrick drops package again]'' Ow!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oops! Gotta start again.}}
{{L|Man Ray|Would, ''[Patrick drops package again]'' Ow!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oops!}}
{{L|Man Ray|''[Growls in anger]'' You butter-fingered pink thing! What's in that box anyhow?}}
{{L|Patrick|My wallets.}}
{{L|Man Ray|''[Screams in fury. He grabs Patrick's head]''}}
{{L|Patrick|No! SpongeBob, tickle him! ''[Man Ray slams Patrick into the ground. SpongeBob presses the tickle button]''}}
{{L|Man Ray|''[laughs]'' It tickles, but it's worth it! ''[continues slamming Patrick into the ground, while still laughing]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Alright, goodness lesson number three. ''[Patrick is shown angry and severely injured]'' Uhh, let's see. ''[Patrick grabs the remote]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?}}
{{L|Man Ray|Umm... 62?}}
{{L|Patrick|Wrong! ''[pushes button]''}}
{{L|Man Ray|Haha! Stop!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.}}
{{L|Patrick|Let go of it, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad!}}
{{L|Patrick|Let go!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, you let go!}}
{{L|Both|Let... go! ''[remote breaks and the belt goes hay-wire]''}}
{{L|Man Ray|Frequency rising! Belt out of control! Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Belt on too hard! ''[he continues to laugh]'' It's tickling my DNA! Make it stop! ''[tears come out as he laughs]'' Haha! Please!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.}}
{{L|Patrick|Peanuts?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No. Please.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Rehabilitated.}}
{{L|Patrick|Gesundheit.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future. ''[unlocks the belt, then the tickling stops]'' Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness. ''[Man Ray takes the Aqua-Glove off the wall of weapons]'' Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff. ''[Man Ray put the glove on his hand and activates it]'' We're not supposed to touch that, either. ''[Man Ray grabs the Cosmic-Ray and attaches it on the Aqua-Glove]'' We are really not suppose to touch those, sir. ''[He aims the weapon at SpongeBob and Patrick]'' Good people have no use for weapons such as... ''[Man Ray zaps them into dust]'' Thooose!}}
{{L|Man Ray|''[laughs]'' The only thing I'm good at is being evil. ''[door opens and Man Ray runs]'' So long, suckers!}}
{{L|Patrick|What's that smell, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.}}
{{L|Patrick|Good, I thought it was my skin.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Forget about your skin, Patrick! Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man...}}
{{L|Patrick|...and Barnacle Boy! ''[both slide down the poles and get their costumes on]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|To the Invisible Boatmobile! ''[both stop in the invisible boat]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Ignition, on!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait! I don't have a license!}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license. ''[shapes hand into a rectangle]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy. ''[they scream as the boat rams through the wall and into a street light]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Thank goodness for invisible seat belts!}}
{{L|Man Ray|''[walks past SpongeBob and Patrick]'' Out of my way, fools! You no longer have control of me. ''[stops at the edge of the cliff and points to Bikini Bottom]'' And now this town belongs to...Man Ray! ''[he does a victory pose]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not so fast, arch-villain! We still have the Orb of Confusion! ''[Patrick takes out the Orb of Confusion]'' Take this! ''[turns it on and gets all confused]'' Doy... Duh...}}
{{L|Man Ray|Well, that was easy. ''[heads to the bank where he kicks in the door]'' Hahaha! All right, people! Everybody stand right where you are!}}
{{L|''[citizens: Vera Fishbowl, Harold "Bill" Reginald, Sylvester, Lloyd-Rich, and Nancy gasp]''}}
{{L|Man Ray|I want you to, uh... ''[Man Ray chuckles, so everyone else chuckles, too]'' No! No! Stop giggling or I'll have to... ''[chuckles again, so everyone else is still chuckling]'' Stop laughing, you fools!}}
{{L|Nancy Suzy Fish|What can I do for you, sir?}}
{{L|Man Ray|I'll tell you what you can do! ''[points glove at the lady]'' Gimme all of your... ''[Man Ray chuckles again]'' G-gimme, gimme all of your... ''[Man Ray is still chuckling]'' Give me...! ''[he chuckles so much he realizes what's going on]'' Aah! The belt is gone, but I still feel its tickle! The urge to do bad is gone! ''[sighs]'' I guess I'll just open a checking account. ''[Man Ray returns to SpongeBob and Patrick and turns the Orb of Confusion off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Doy... ''[gasps]'' Man Ray!}}
{{L|Man Ray|No need to be alarmed, SpongeBob. Your teachings have transformed me. Besides, I have checks... with little poodles on them! ''[Man Ray takes his head off and gives it to SpongeBob]'' I won't be needing this anymore. Farewell, fellow do-gooder. ''[walks off]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Bye, Man Ray! Wow, we did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We saved the day! Isn't it incredible, Patrick? Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Uhh... ''[still has a confused look on his face]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Woo-hoo? Patrick?}}
