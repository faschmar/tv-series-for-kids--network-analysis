{{L|Sherm Cohen|Hi, my name is Sherm Cohen and I am one of the storyboard artists on the SpongeBob SquarePants show. We are here today to show you a segment called, "How to Draw SpongeBob SquarPants and His Underwater Buddies." They're a few things that you are going to need for this activity, and that's paper, pencils, an eraser, and if you'd like you can also use colored pencils or some markers; it's all up to you. I am gonna show you how to draw each of the main characters, one by one, from start to finish, and we'll end up with some nice finished drawings. And I just wanna let you know that if your drawings don't look like mine right away, well that's okay; I've had a lot of practice on the show. And for drawing the character on television we have to draw the character over and over, and we all had a hard time at first, but I know if you keep at it they'll look just fine. So grab your pencil, grab your paper, [in a pirate like voice] are you ready kids? Let's draw SpongeBob and his underwater buddies.}}

{{L|Sherm Cohen|And now we are going to draw SpongeBob SquarePants.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in a bubble in the bottom right corner]'' This is gonna be great! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Sherm Cohen|''[now shows a paper with Sherm drawing on it]'' So we start with basically square shape{{sic}}, with a slight bit of a tilt to it. ''[shows him drawing a rectangle]'' ''[draws 3D rectangular prism]'' ... and that's to give it a bit of life, and he's not so perfectly rigid. And draw some pants here and the side as well. ''[shows a box with a line at the bottom to separate the pants from the shirt]'' }}
