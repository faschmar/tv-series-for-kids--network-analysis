{{L|Don Snapper|Hello, I'm Don Snapper. And welcome to Fish Food Rescue, the show where I snap on disgusting food establishments. Today, we're going somewhere we've never gone before. The Krusty Krab. Let's see how krusty this place is.}}
{{L|Narrator|The Krusty Krab has been shelling out quality service with its signature Krabby Patty is the sizzling source of revenue. Mr. Krabs has served over 50 billion aquatic customers.}}
{{L|Don Snapper|Wow! This place seems spotless from bow to stern! How about the krustomer's satisfaction?}}
{{L|Customers|The only people who don't like a Krabby Patty, have never tasted one!}}
{{L|Don Snapper|Satisfaction duly noted. But how about the busyness of the business?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' At first, we didn't know what to do with all the money.}}
{{L|''[Clips of Mr. Krabs' happy moments with his money.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But in the end, we decided to just give it all away.}}
{{L|''[Patrick gives a customer a box of money.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Come again, sir!}}
{{L|Don Snapper|Holy fishpaste! You keep selling those and you'll never go out of business!}}
{{L|Plankton|Yippee.}}
{{L|Don Snapper|But how about your competition?}}
{{L|Plankton|Where you can enjoy a nice helping of chum. ''[sarcastically]'' Oh, boy this is so... ''[pretends to eat it by hiding it behind his head]'' ...good.}}
{{L|Don Snapper|Barnacles! This place is serving plank-tons of filth!}}
{{L|Plankton|What? It's just an ordinary Krabbyâ€” ''[Scene zooms in to show the patty made with gross-out items]'' Oh, my goodness!}}
{{L|Don Snapper|I don't embrace excuses. We need to shut it down!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[whimpering, starts bawling]''}}
{{L|Don Snapper|Shut it down! I'm Don Snapper. Tune in next time when we try and save the Chum Bucket. Trust me. I'm a professional expert.}}
