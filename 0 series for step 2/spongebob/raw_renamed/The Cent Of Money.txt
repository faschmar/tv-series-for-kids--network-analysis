{{L|SpongeBob|''[sings to himself, then addresses Gary]'' I'm sorry, Gary. I thought you were done.... ''[now pushed down]'' Wow. This town is sure going downhill. ''[bumps into Mr. Krabs' parked boat]'' Uh, Mr. Krabs. What are you doing out here?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well...you know...unwinding. Enjoying the free parking. ''[The "P" falls off the sign that reads "free parking. Gary's eyes start wiggling]'' What's happening to your little critter here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know, but when he does that he usually finds change.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Change? As in legal tender?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah. Watch. ''[A penny flies onto Gary's shell]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wow. Shiver me shell wax. You're like a little money detecting... Uh... You know... A sneagle.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You mean snail.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Thank you, SpongeBob. How about you bring your sneagle into work with ye?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You said pets were not nothing but disease-carrying vermins that should never be brought to the workplace.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But that was before I knew that they had such an amazing talent.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But the whole process causes Gary big discomfort. I could never do it to him.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I could.}}
{{L|''[Scene skips to the Krusty Krab. Money flies from the floor onto Gary's shell and Mr. Krabs takes it.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|There you go. Bring in that change. ''[money comes from the order boat and then from a piece of gum]'' I've been working on that one for months. [laughs]}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's so funny, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uhh...SpongeBob. Shouldn't you be out back scrubbing the dumpster?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Done and done!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Then get back there and scrub the poop deck, so to speak.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, sir!}}
{{L|Gary|''[gets the coins on his shell]''}}
{{L|Nat|Hey! What are you doing with my change?!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Your change? Anything on the floor be fair game. ''[Gary gets change from two people.]''}}
{{L|Sun Breathe Nazz|Hey! ''[money goes into Mr. Krabs' pockets. The back of Mr. Krabs' pants falls off and a lot of money comes out]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|[laughs] Looks like I need pockets for me pockets! ''[A whole group of customers walks out of the Krusty Krab, muttering angrily.]'' Ah. Fine! With my new money finder... Who needs ya?! ''[slams the door]'' Ahh. I was about to close up shop anyways.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Close up! Come on, Gare. You're coming with me.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You aren't taking him anywhere yet. You haven't greased the fryer yet. ''[slams a brush in SpongeBob's mouth]'' Don't worry about Jerry. I'll make sure he gets his nightly craw.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gary.}}
{{L|''[scene skips to Goo Lagoon]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[uses Gary like a detector. Money comes from the ground and then a sunbather] ''Heh, heh. Excuse me, ma'am. ''[scene skips to the middle of Bikini Bottom; Krabs holds Gary over a sewer drain. Money comes from the sewer]'' Dirty money spends just like the clean. ''[bumps into SpongeBob and accidentally shoves Gary into his mouth]'' SpongeBob, what are you doing here?''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|[pushes Gary out] Mr. Krabs, I finished the- [grabs Mr. Krabs' money sack and barfs money into it] I finished scrubbing the fryer, sir.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You sure make easy work.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Try telling that to my frizzled hands. ''[his hands disintegrate]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah, but you still have work to do.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I do?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah. How about you rearrange the wall rivets from smallest to largest?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But aren't they the same size.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That's what they want you to know. Now take a long look.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Will do, captain. ''[Leaves]'' Lalalalalala!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now back to our treasure hunt. Eh, boy?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow. ''[his eyes wiggle]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You okay, boy? ''[money comes out of parking meters]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow. ''[hides in his shell]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That a boy.}}
{{L|''[scene skips to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[uses a magnifying glass]'' Mr. Krabs is right. Some of these rivets are off by as much as five nanometers. Well, I better get to work.}}
{{L|''[scene skips to Mr. Krabs and Gary]''}}
{{L|Gary|''[falls asleep]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. There's no stopping. There's a laundromat that needs to be cleaned out. [laughs] Cleaned out. Get it? Ahh. Never mind. Mush!}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|If you don't get moving, I'm gonna'...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're gonna' do what, sir?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'm gonna' give him a snaily treat. ''[stuffs a treat in Gary's mouth]'' See?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Gary look at each other]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ohh, okay. The rivets are all rearranged.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What?! How is that possible? Uh, now I want you to paint the Krusty Krab.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay. That's easy.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uh, uh, uh, but I want you to do it with this toothbrush. ''[gives SpongeBob a toothbrush]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay. Bye, old pal.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry about Terry. He's in good claws.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm sure he is. Bye.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Now little sneagle. Ready to do some laundry? [laughs]}}
{{L|''[scene skips to the laundromat]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.}}
{{L|Tough guy|Hey, where's my change? ''[Mr. Krabs runs out with Gary and the coins]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hee, hee, hee, hee.}}
{{L|Tough guy|Well, that stinks.}}
{{L|''[scene to Mr. Krabs and Gary]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|[laughs] I guess he didn't see that coming. ''[bumps into a building]'' Hey, what's the big ide-er? We've just found a pot at the end of the rainbow. Aieeeee! ''[goes in]''}}
{{L|Old Man Jenkins|''[coins fly from the machine]'' What the?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It's like taking candy from a baby!}}
{{L|Old Man Jenkins|And that old whip shoo the coins just flew from the machine!}}
{{L|Security guard|Ahh, don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uh-oh. Pronto. Time for plan B! ''[grabs a dress]''}}
{{L|''[scene skips to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah ha! That should do it! ''[climbs down a ladder]'' Ahh. Time to check in with Mr. Krabs to see if he needs me to do anymore impossible stuff.}}
{{L|Tough guy|Oh boy, I'm not gonna hear the end of this when I get home.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Pardon me sir. You haven't seen a crab walking around with a snail, have you?}}
{{L|Tough guy|Say, are you in with those thieving criminals too?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thi-thieving what?}}
{{L|Tough guy|Them two jerks what stole my money. The fat one used his sneagle to swipe my coins from me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|His sneagle?}}
{{L|Tough Guy|That's right. Why, the coins were sticking right to his shell.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|[laughs]}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, what have you done to my Gary? ''[sighs]'' So this is what a hotbed of sin looks like.}}
{{L|''[scene skips to the bathroom]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|[laughs] How's it going, boyo? You feeling the coin vibes?}}
{{L|Gary|Pu, pu, pow.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What do you mean you don't feel so good?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow. ''[sweats]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You look fine to me. Now quit being such a baby and start making me some money. Excuse me! Excuse me! Pregnant lady coming through! ''[chuckles and walks into the security guard]'' Uh, he he. Ooh, boy. It... it sure is hard being preggers!}}
{{L|Security guard|Uh...yeah. ''[Mr. Krabs walks on, then notices all the buckets full of coins sitting at the games.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[gasps, then squeals as he looks at more buckets]'' Ooh! ''[pants. people are carrying buckets and are putting their hands into them. Mr. Krabs gets nervous]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[to Gary]'' Get ready for it now, boy, me boy! ''[to everyone]'' Ladies and gentlemen! ''[Everyone looks at Mr. Krabs.]'' Thank you for your money! ''[lifts up Gary. Nothing happens.]''}}
{{L|Player 1|Huh?}}
{{L|Player 2|What?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Come on, Harry! Let's go. Come on, you! ''[shakes Gary]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs! For shame!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What do you mean? I'm just showing Rory off.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't you lie to me! I know all about you using Gary to steal money!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I am doing nothing of the sort! ''[Gary's eyes wiggle]'' I would never steal... You have to quit making up stories, boyo!}}
{{L|''[Some of the coin buckets begin to wiggle]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm not making up anything! I know all about your little scheme! You're the one making up stories!}}
{{L|''[More buckets wiggle]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Don't you have work you should be doing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, that's rich!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No, if I was rich, I wouldn't have to hire the likes of you!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's hurtful, Mr. Krabs, and you know it.}}
{{L|''[More buckets wiggle faster]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Why you little yellow... Well, I never...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You never what? Learned to use decent language? ''[People scream and run.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Who do you think you are?! ''[the big wave of money begins to approach SpongeBob, Gary, and Mr. Krabs]'' Jackpot! ''[throws Gary into SpongeBob's arms and rushes toward the wave of coins]'' Money, money, money, money, money money, money! ''[Mr. Krabs keeps running to the big wave of coins]'' Come to papa! ''[stops as he realizes his mistake far too late]'' Oh, boy.}}
{{L|''[Scene skips to the hospital]''}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|Yeah he's in pretty bad shape with the impact of all that metal but he'll pull through.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Doctor? How does this sort of thing happen?}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|I think this has something to do with it. ''[gives SpongeBob a magnet]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, my ''Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy'' fridge magnet!}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|Yes, it appears that your pet swallowed it. It has a very strong magnetic pull. ''[holds a coin and it flies onto the magnet]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Cause' it's a magnet! That's it, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|[laughs] Well, what do ya' know?}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|Unfortunately, there's still the matter of the bill. ''[gives Mr. Krabs the bill]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What? Oh, I can't afford this.}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|Actually, it looks like you've got just enough change to cover it. ''[Mr. Krabs watches a nurse walk away with all the money]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Nooooooo!}}
