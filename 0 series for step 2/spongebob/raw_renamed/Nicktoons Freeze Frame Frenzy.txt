{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Goddard, look! There's something strange going on here... and it's not just Retroville, there's something going on across all our worlds. All five Worlds seem to be having the same problem. I'm getting readings of a huge magnetic disturbance, and my satellites are showing the cities in total chaos. Let's start investigating. My Intermodular Digital Transporter is standing by! Fairy OddParents World. Okay. Let's BLAST! Who should we contact to send out the first mission? Hello SpongeBob, do you read me? It seems there's trouble in our neighborhoods and I need you to help get to the bottom of it! Welcome! I would like you to take my newest invention, the 'Neutrino-Cam 4000' on a test run into the field. I'm counting on you to take as many pictures as possible for the investigation. I'll download the pictures into my Vox-2000 Computer System for analysis. Let's get a move on, we don't have time to waste! It seems that there are many 'misplaced' people that have been somehow transported into worlds where they don't belong! I have created an attachment to the camera that homes on on these 'out of place characters' and teleports them back to their real homes. Take pictures of any characters that look out of place or aren't supposed to be in Dimsdale. While you are there, Timmy's looking for his parents: if you see them take their picture to help him and find them. Also take pictures of 6 rare birds in each area. You must earn a total of 5,000 points to advance. First Objective: Identify any characters hiding. Let's see if we can send them back where they belong. Second Objective: Photograph Timmy's parents. Third Objective: Photograph 6 birds and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 5,000 points. Let's calculate how we did. That was stupendous! I'm picking up a transmission from Fairy OddParents World... this is really strange.}}
{{L|Gruff Voice|Report your progress to me at once, faithful robotic impostorminion!}}
{{L|Robotic Voice|Greetings, fearless commander. I am now disguised and the plan is underway.}}
{{L|Gruff Voice|Very well. Once you are in place, go forth with the next phase of the plan... BZZZ... BBZZTTT... TTT.}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Disguise? 'The Plan'? What on earth is going on here/ I hope you can help discover more about what's going on! There's something weird happening at the Dimmsdale Elementary School. There appear to be lots of out of place characters in the area. Go there and see if you can find anything strange. You'll need 12,000 points to move ahead. First Objective: Investigate the school and discover characters that are misplaced in this world throughout the school. Second Objective: Photograph people eating lunch. Third Objective: Photograph 6 posters 6 of this world' inhabitants. Goal: 12,000 points. How' the investigating progressing? Amazing job! Another report is coming in. I'll put all the data we've collected so far into my processor for analysis...}}
{{L|Computer|There is a robot in the Dimsdale Elementary School that is not from our world, it contains parts that are alien in origin.}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Interesting... Clearly, we must find the exact location of this robot and learn more information about it. Looks like lots of out of place characters are in the school lockers, you better check them all out! I also understand that there's another photographer in the school. Try to find out who it is! You must earn 12,000 points to complete this world. Get moving! First Objective: Find 3 characters that are misplaced in this world. Second Objective: Photograph mysterious photographer in the school. Third Objective: Photograph 3 posters and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 12,000 points. Neutron, here, requesting a report on the investigation. With all of the information you have collected, my computer has pinpointed a possible location of the robot! It's time for confront it!}}
{{L|Urgent Directive|An evil 'robot impostor' version of Eddie is trying to escape through the boiler pipe work! You must take his picture when he merges from one of his pipes. You're heading into what looks like basement of the Dimsdale Elementary School, take pictures of the evil impostor Eddie to stop him!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, I think it's time to par-tay!}}
{{L|Boss|I I love to dance! Do you tango?}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Welcome back! Thanks a lot for your help! This World is peaceful again. The total score for this adventure is...... Area 1. Area 2. Area 3. Area 4. Keep it up. I know you can do it. Thanks a lot and see you later. Reports indicate that SpongeBob has been trapped up a tree, take some pictures so that the fire department knows where he is so he can be rescued. While you're there, do some of your own jelly fishing! Photograph 6 jellyfish in each area. You'll get a 1000 points for any out of place character found hiding in Bikini Bottom. Earn 12,000 points to escape this mess! Also, try this Neutro-02 Gum I made. It will help you breathe underwater. First Objective: Photograph 17 characters that are misplaced in this world. Check the Portholes! Second Objective: Photograph SpongeBob on a tree limb. Third Objective: Photograph 6 jellyfish and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 12,000 points. Alright, I think we are getting closer to the source of this robot impostor attack! As far as I can determine, we should, continue collecting information from these strange robots and attempt to fix the problems they are causing in each world... it should lead us directly to the source of the problem soon! Amazing! We're on the right track! The pieces are beginning to come together. Wow! I'm getting reports of some sort of 'robot' in Bikini Bottom! I also have reports that someone has been digging through a dumpster near the Krusty Krab. See what you can dig up! It looks like there are quite a few out of place characters in Bikini Bottom, see how many you can find. You'll need 7,000 pints here to blast to the next area! First Objective: Photograph 2 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph trashcans. Third Objective: Photograph 6 jellyfish and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 7,000 points. Neutron, here. What's the status of the mission? The computer has detected something strange at the bottom of the ocean... Bikini Bottom... in an abandoned shipwreck. We don't have a lot of time! Nice work! Remember that discovering each out of place is worth 1000 points. The Flying Dutchman is letting ghostly creature into Bikini Bottom! Try to snap some shots of them for me. We are getting closer to Bikini Bottom's 'evil impostor robot', we have to find it before it cause any more problems! We're counting on you! First Objective: Photograph 22 out of place characters. Second Objective: Photograph The Flying Dutchman releasing monsters. Third Objective: Photograph 6 jellyfish and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 23,000 points. Hey, check this out! I've determined that there's another robotic imposter tearing apart Bikini Bottom and causing all sorts of problems. I'll send a few pieces of my Neutro-02 Gum to you that will allow you to breathe underwater. Amazing! Bikini Bottom thanks you! If you can, find this robotic imposter and see if you can take its central processor. I should able to figure out more about the person giving the orders if I can get a closer look at the technology. Great job so far, but apparently Sandy is being attacked by a giant calm! Try to take a photo of the attack. By my calculation, you need to collect 14,000 points to get to the next stage! That means you'll have to find more out of place characters. You can do it! First Objective: Photograph 12 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph giant calm attacking Sandy. Third Objective: Photograph 6 jellyfish and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 14,000 points. Let's see what my computer can pull from this. It looks like there's a... what? ... A robotic version of Danny Fenton's Dad, Jack. And it's trying to destroy... Sandy's Tree Dome? Get in there and stop him, and try to bring back his 'Main Processor' for analysis! The Dr. Fenton robot is exceptionally large, but appears to have the ability to move with lightning speed. Good Luck! I've got an idea. Aim for his suction machine after you daze him. That should put him out of commission.}}
{{L|Danny|You are not my father and you won't get away with impersonating him, robot!}}
{{L|Boss|Now, now, Danny. Really, I am your real father.}}
{{L|Danny|Robot, you don't have a clue!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Welcome back! Thanks a lot for your help! This World is peaceful again. The total score for this adventure is....... Area 1, Area 2, Area 3, Area 4. Total. Keep it up. I know you can do it. Thanks a lot and see you later. Wow! That was hard, but we managed to get the robot imposter's central processing unit! This should help tell us who's causing this chaos and why!}}
{{L|Computer|Downloading all data from the Fenton robot imposter's processor! Most data unreadable. Robot imposter programmed to infiltrate, to become Jack Fenton. All language undecipherable. Possibly alien in origin.}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Wow! Just as I suspected! This is some sort of alien plan to use robot duplicates to take over each world! We need to find out who's controlling these robot duplicates and stop them! Hello, Tommy, do you read me? It seems there's trouble in our neighborhoods and I need you to help get to the bottom of it! Welcome! I would like you to take my newest invention, the 'Neutrino-Cam 4000' on a test run into the field. I'm counting on you to take as many pictures as possible for the investigation. I'll download the pictures into my Vox-2000 Computer System for analysis. Let's get a move on, we don't have time to waste! I've had reports of some more out of place characters in Ocean Shores! Seems like there's something really wrong here, 'robotic imposters' are causing more and more problems, we need to catch them quickly. It looks like the robot in this world has released some monkeys from the zoo! Find 6 monkeys, so they can be taken back. Also, try to take some pictures of Otto and Ray they are looking for one another. Looks like we'll need 16,000 points before we can advance to the next level. First Objective: Photograph 10 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph Ray calling Otto. Third Objective: Photograph 6 monkeys and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 16,000 clue points. Alright, just like in the other cities, we are pinpointing the robotic imposter transmissions. We have to clean up Ocean Shores as possible! We are hot on this robotic imposter's trail! A new development. It's not only monkeys who climb trees! Get ready to take pictures of a Wild Boy as he swings from tree to tree. We still need more clues to find the imposter robots inside this level. In this area, earn 18,000 points to move on. First Objective: Photograph 12 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph Donnie jumping from tree to tree. Third Objective: 6 monkeys and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 18,000 points. Checking in. The pictures have been successfully uploaded to my supreme info-processor system. This will prove exceptionally useful to the investigation. Looks like we are getting closer to finding the evil robotic imposter and gettin' out of here. We better get moving! The Tornberrys have several out of place characters in their Commvee. Investigate immediately and take as possible. See what you can find! You'll need 20,000 points to complete this mission. First Objective: Photograph 10 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph robotic imposters in the Commvee. Third Objective: Photograph 6 monkeys and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 20,000 points. You're approximately 75% there! This robotic imposter's causing a mess! We have to keep going and put a stop to it! We're getting close... Only a few more out of place characters to send home picture of Otto on the Skateboard Ramp. He's really tearing it up! We need 25,000 points so get a snapping! First Objective: Photograph 14 misplace characters. Second Objective: Photograph Otto skateboarding. Third Objective: Photograph 6 monkeys and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 25,000 points. The computer is outputting the data... let's see... Great! You did it! Alright, I'm tracking the robot imposter on my radar... this is strange the robot is some sort of sea creature... it looks like... it is... Squidward Tentacles Robot! This is the speediest squid I've ever seen! I wonder if this robotic imposter is as much of a grump as the real Squidward! You have to catch the Squid-Bot three times, but first you have to stun him.}}
{{L|Tommy|Let me get this straight, you're supposed to be a friend of SpongeBob, right? But you aren't really because you're a robot...}}
{{L|Boss|I wouldn't say that I was a 'friend' of SpongeBob's either way... and I'm definitely not your friend!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Welcome back! Thanks a lot for your help! This world is peaceful again. The total score for this adventure is....... Area, 1, Area 2, Area 3, Area 4. Total. Keep it up. I know you can do it. Thanks a lot and see you later.}}
{{L|Zim|Rats! That's the third evil robot that has been defeated. Even more, they are starting to catch on to me!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Hello, Arnold, do you read me? It seems there's trouble in our neighborhoods and I need you to help get to the bottom of it! Welcome! I would like you to take my newest invention, the 'Neutrino-Cam 4000' on a test run into the field. I'm counting on you to take as many pictures as possible for the investigation. I'll download the pictures into my Vox-2000 Computer System for analysis. Let's get a move on, we don't have time to waste! We need to help the characters who have been mixed up and transported into Danny's World. Use your camera to teleport them home as quickly as you can! I've also had reports that Sandy is fending off some ghosts with her Karate, get some pictures of that! Take pictures of 6 ghosts in each area so that Danny can round them up! You must earn 10,000 points to reach the next area. First Objective: Photograph 5 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph Dandy fending off ghosts. Third Objective: Photograph 6 ghosts and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 10,000 points. There, your collected information has been input into my computer! Alright! It looks like we have gathered enough information here. Let's see.... Looks like once again I have located evidence of another evil imposter robot loose in Danny's world... and it looks like this robot has released Sampson the white ape! Get a shot of Sampson so he can be easily located for capture. Remember to use your camera to take as many pictures as you can, you can't take too many pictures! You must accumulate 28,000 points here. Get to work! First Objective: Photograph 28 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph escaped Gorilla. Third Objective: Photograph 6 ghosts and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 28,000 points. Checking in. The pictures are successfully uploading to the Vox-2000. This will prove exceptionally useful to the investigation. We are getting closer to an answer here! We are nearly there! Find the whereabouts of more misplaced characters and help send them home! Also Jenny is trying to cut class, take her picture to catch her red handed! You'll need 32,000 points to advance to the next area. First Objective: Photograph 22 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph Jenny escaping through the school window. Third Objective: Photograph 6 ghosts and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 32,000 points. Cool! Soon we should get some answers! We are getting closer to finding out exactly where this new robotic imposter is headed, you are on the right track. Reportedly, there are some in misplaced characters hiding behind closed doors. We need to investigate. Try to get some shots of them. You must earn 32,000 points to complete this world. First Objective: 26 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph doors and people behind them. Third Objective: Photograph 6 ghosts of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 32,000 points. Alright, I think I've pinpointed the hiding place of the robotic imposter who has been causing all the problems here. Based on your photographic information and my satellite tracking, it looks like this robot is impersonating... Helga! I have created an attachment for the camera that should home on the robot imposter's communication with the person who is controlling it. With this attachment we should be able to discover exactly where it came from. So here's the information that I have on the Helga-Bot. Her creator has given her the ability to 'teleport' meaning she will be a difficult target. The robot is impossible to photograph while teleporting, make sure the Helga-Bot is visible to get it!}}
{{L|Arnold|I can't believe I'm seeing this! A robot Helga! This is crazy, I wish Gerald was here to see this!}}
{{L|Boss|Arnold! Did I ever tell you how much I like you? I mean, I really like you!}}
{{L|Arnold|Aw man! Even the robot Helga has a crush on me!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Welcome back! Thanks a lot for your help! This world is peaceful again. The total score for this adventure is....... Area, 1, Area 2, Area 3, Area 4. Boss. Total. Keep it up. I know you can do it. Thanks a lot and see you later. So, the readings I got from the new camera attachment have given me the exact location of the person or thing controlling these monstrosities! Looks like the communication is coming from... this can't be right... It's coming from Zim's town! Hello, Timmy, do you read me? It seems there's trouble in our neighborhoods and I need you to help get to the bottom of it! Welcome! I would like you to take my newest invention, the 'Neutrino-Cam 4000' on a test run into the field. I'm counting on you to take as many pictures as possible for the investigation. I'll download the pictures into my Vox-2000 Computer System for analysis. Let's get a move on, we don't have time to waste! Let's continue our investigation into those evil hidden robots' plans and try to get to the bottom of the problem: Who is controlling them? Try and find any misplaced characters in this world. I have to take a good look at the clues and try to figure out how they are being 'misplaced'. Also, talk take some pictures of store windows. Look for fruit as well, I need 6 pictures of fruit in each area. You must earn 20,000 points! First Objective: Explore behind windows and doors to find 25 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph store windows. Third Objective: Photograph 6 pieces of fruit and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 20,000 points. Alright, I'm inputting your photographic data now.... Great, looks like we're on the right track! Reports are showing that this area is full of 'out of place' characters! Try to take as many photos of them as you can so I can try to figure out how they got mixed up. There's also a strange problem with the ice cream here. Ice cream of all flavors is disappearing! Who can be causing this? Take pictures to get to the bottom of this high fructose dilemma! It's going to be tough, you will need 28,000 points. Good luck! First Objective: Find 25 characters that are visiting this world. Second Objective: Photograph the person stealing ice cream! Third Objective: Photograph 6 pieces of fruit and of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 28,000 points. I think you got some great information, let's see. Nice work! Looks like we'll clean up these robotic imposters in no time! This area has quite a few misplaced people in it, we'll have to send as many home as possible. Good luck! Hmmm, a report is coming in that the Flying Dutchman has been complaining of a bully, check out who is harassing him. We need 30,000 points here. No joke! Get snapping! First Objective: Photograph 20 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph the Flying Dutchman being bullied. Third Objective: Photograph 6 pieces of fruit and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 30,000 points. Give me a sec while I input your collected data... Okay, I'm getting huge readings of 'robot activity' near Tommy Pickles home. We better send someone out there, it must be another robot imposter! Hang on, more reports coming in. There have been complaints of flying skateboarders in the area. You must photograph this unusual activity. Snap them and any out of place characters to earn 12,000 points! We are close to solving the mystery of the misplaced characters and the robot imposter in this world! First Objective: Photograph 7 misplaced characters. Second Objective: Photograph Reggie flying with on her skateboard. Third Objective: Photograph 6 pieces of fruit and 6 of this world's inhabitants. Goal: 12,000 points. Neutron here, let's input into my computer and see what you got! Good work. The data you collected has allowed us to pinpoint the evil 'Vicky-Bot'! And she's up on the roof! This robotic imposter is so evil it's ready hard to tell it apart from the real Vicky! Quickly, let's get you to the roof and put and end to this robo-sitter's tyranny. Ah-ha the Vicky-Bot! Now, see if you can leave this robot's central processor intact, it could hold some vulnerable information! It seems like the Vicky-Bot is being controlled by Crocker. It would be a good idea to try and stop all communications to the Vicky-Bot to stop it.}}
{{L|Timmy|Alright, Mr. Crocker! What's going on here?}}
{{L|Boss|Hello Timmy Turner, I've invited one of your favorite friends to come out and play.}}
{{L|Timmy|Vicky? Vicky! Wait, that's not the real Vicky... and you aren't the real Crocker!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Welcome back! Thanks a lot for your help! This world is peaceful again. The total score for this adventure is....... Area, 1, Area 2, Area 3, Area 4. Boss. Total. Keep it up. I know you can do it Thanks a lot and see you later.}}
{{L|Zim|Those useless puny earth creatures have terminated all the radio communications from the evil robots. I must continue my plan! I must find and repair my robots! Jimmy Neutron Human! It's all your fault! You will pay for destroying all of my evil imposter robots! Trust me Neutron Human, I will make you pay for this!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Based on my analysis of the Vicky-Bot's wreckage I should be able to triangulate the exact source of the problem. What is this! This strange U.F.O. is giving off massive energy signatures: it's eating more power up than my lab. Wait a minute, according to my calculations, that ship is heading straight for my house! Here's the plan. I'll use the Strato XL to get to the U.F.O. before it reaches Earth! Let's go! We're right on course. The ship is trapped! Now, we must enter and put an end to this plan! Invader Zim! It was you along! Your robots are defeated! Give up now and I'll let you go!}}
{{L|Zim|Bring it on! I've got enough tools here to smash that blasted camera into tiny little pieces!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Invader Zim is trying to destroy the camera. Take pictures of the objects that Zim throws at you and teleport them away.}}
{{L|Zim|Neutron Human! Get out of my ship! G.I.R.! Let's stop this meddling human once and for all! This is not possible!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Are you ready to admit that you're finally defeated, Invader Zim?}}
{{L|Zim|What now? My ship is falling! We're out of fuel! We're being pulled into the earth! We're breaking up in the atmosphere! We're going to be smashed to smithereens!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|I think I can fix the problem. Where is your engine room?}}
{{L|Zim|Are you kidding, Neutron? I will never trust you, human! Get off my ship!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Wherever you tell me where it is or not, I'm going to find it. This ship will land to safely or my name isn't Jimmy Neutron!}}
{{L|Zim|Okay, substandard brain boy, here's the power supply. Let me fix the computer, you know nothing of this advanced technology!}}
{{L|Jimmy||Okay, while you pinpoint the computer problem, I'll stop the Plasma-Steam leaks!}}
{{L|Zim|Careful, Neutron! If the power meter reaches 0, we'll be destroyed! Hurry up, we've only got 60 seconds. Alright, Neutron Human. The ship has been reprogrammed and repaired. But hear me now! If it wasn't for you, my evil plan would have worked!}}
{{L|G.I.R.|No it wouldn't have.}}
{{L|Zim|Yes it would have!}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Alright, Zim. I hope that his is all over. I have to get back to Earth. There's a huge mess to clean up.}}
{{L|Zim|Neutron Human! If you didn't just save my ship I would...}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Save it, Zim. I'm going to let you go this time, but be warned, if you ever try anything like this again you're going to have to answer Jimmy Neutron!}}
{{L|Zim|Zim answers to no one, boy! Be glad I'm letting you leave with your life!}}
{{L|(At Jimmy's Huge Party)}}
{{L|Jimmy Neutron|Listen up, everyone, with your courage, skill and strength, we were able to uncover Zim's evil plot and stop all of the robotic imposters! Thanks again! I'm sure we aren't going to see him around these parts anytime soon! Okay, everyone smile... on the count of 3. 1... 2... 3!}}
{{L|(At Voot Cruiser)}}
{{L|Zim|A-HA! I think I've found out where I went wrong! G.I.R.! Hand me that wrench and those bolts! Those disgusting, wretched humans will pay for what they did to me this day! I will take over the world!}}
