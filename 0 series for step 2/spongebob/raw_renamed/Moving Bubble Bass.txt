{{L|Narrator|Snark Chat with Bubble Bass.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|And we're back. My first guest had dinner with me just last night. He's a close personal friend of mine. Please welcome the Krabby Patty. ''[audience clap]'' Great to have you back on the program.}}
{{L|Krabby Patty|Great to be here, BB.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Well, I'm sorry to say it, but last night, you were not quite as delicious as one would hope.}}
{{L|Krabby Patty|Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Mr. Krabs will give you a refund. ''[percussion sting] [laughter]''}}
{{L|Mama Bass|Bubble Bass, who are you talking to down there?}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Mother! Please stop trying to undermine my fantasy talk show! ''[Krabby Patty thuds]'' Mmph.}}
{{L|Mama Bass|You march yourself upstairs this instant! Take out the garbage, dry the dishes, and walk the worm!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Ooh, I don't feel like it!  Huh? ''[Mama Bass throws garbage, two dishes, and the worm at Bubble Bass]'' That tears it, Mother! ''[grunts]'' I am moving out! ''[slams the front door]''}}
{{L|Mama Bass|Moving? Hah! You can't even do your own laundry! ''[grunts]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[underwear lands on Bubble Bass's face, and a fly is heard buzzing. SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing in the background]'' All I need to do is find two able-bodied idiots. But where am I to find such stupidity on such short notice? Hm... ''[wagoon crashes into Bubble Bass]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoops. ''[Bubble Bass grunts]'' Sorry, Bubble Bass.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Why you two able-bodied idiots! I—  ''[gasps and giving an evil grin]'' Ooh. ''[Patrick sobbers and SpongeBob blinks strangely]'' Why, SpongeBob and Patrick, my occasional friends. How would you two like to earn a free lunch?}}
{{L|Patrick|Freeeeeee lunch! ''[His head turns as if a balloon and then explodes]'}}
{{L|Bubble Bass| All righty, we're moving all of my belongings out of my mother's basement into my grandmother's basement across town. Let's start with my lounge.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, Patrick, up with the loveseat. ''[grunts]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[fakes having his back popped by breaking a stick]'' Ow! My bad back! I guess you two will have to move everything without me. So I'll meet you both at this address.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But don't you have to pack your things before we can move 'em?}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Ooh, ahh, I guess you'll have to pack my stuff too. But remember with gastric prizes await your mouths.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[beat horn blares from ship]''  Oh, Patrick ''[puts a finger inside Patrick's mouth, causing him to fill up and release water]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, Patrick, let's get p-p-p-packing!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[grumbles trying to fit a stool into the box, breaking the stool in the process] [hums]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh... ''[grunts, puts on welder's helmet, and turns on torch. He hums and then laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pushes computers in the box grunting]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[grunts] [water from toilet splashes] [toilet shatters]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grunts]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both grunt trying to push wooden planks]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[hits mail-box with an ax, causing clanging]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[exclaims]'' ''[spits out mail]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[gasps]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grunts]''}}
{{L|Patrick|All right, that's the last of it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whew, I hope we didn't leave anything behind.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[grunts]'' ''[part of the house clangs]''}}
{{L|Kids|''[laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grunts]''}}
{{L|Old Man Jenkins|''[screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both grunt]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh pardon us, ma'am, but could you walk around?}}
{{L|Ms. Mildred|Walk around? Hmph, I'm Lady Upturn the 333rd, and you want me to walk around? ''[laughs]'' I'm afraid you just have to back it up.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Back it up? ''[backup alarm blares]'' Okay. Back it up, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|What'd you say?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grunts]'' Oh, oh, oh!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[grunts]'' ''[giggles afterward]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pants]'' ''[screams]''}}
{{L|Ms. Mildred|''[screams]'' ''[grunts]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both exclaim]''}}
{{L|Ms. Mildred|Oh! ''[spits shoe out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both exclaim]'' ''[cars vroom, scratching their behind]'' Huh? ''[embarrassed shock]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Phew, hey, Patrick, from now on, we gotta be more careful. Huh? Patrick...}}
{{L|Patrick|''[giggles, thinking about the free lunch]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob blows the thought away, and Patrick yells]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, focus, Patrick, focus!}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay. ''[grunts "focusing"]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah, that's perfect. ''[grunts]'' ''[laughs]'' ''[grunts again]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[giggles]'' ''[starts grunting]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Hmm? ''[both scream]''}}
{{L|Snail|''[meows after being stuck on the bag]''}}
{{L|Old Man Jenkins|''[mumbles]'' I can walk! ''[turns around]'' Oh!}}
{{L|Kids|''[laugh]'' ''[Ryan screams, along with SpongeBob and Patrick]'' ''[bag comes back to get the other two]'' Oh!}}
{{L|Old Man Jenkins|''[exclaims briefly]''}}
{{L|Babies|''[laughter]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Babies?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grunts]'' ''[motor revs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both scream]'' [''tires screech]''}}
{{L|Babies|''[babble]''}}
{{L|''[bag thuds on SpongeBob and Patrick]''}}
{{L|Random people|''[scream]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[grunts]'' SpongeBob? Where are you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grunts]'' I'm down here. ''[giggles]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[giggles]'' Shall we, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We shall, Patrick.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both hum]''}}
{{L|Babies|''[laughter]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Babies? No! ''[both scream]''}}
{{L|Babies|''[laughter]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Whoa! ''[both grunt]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmm... Hm? ''[turns paper around]'' Hey, this is the address! We made it, Patrick! Nice aim, babies!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hooray! Now, where's that free lunch? ''[slurps]'' ''[thinks again about it]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[groans]'' ''[slaps Patrick]'' Focus! Let's get all this stuff inside the house, then we can eat. Hmm, hmm.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hmm, hmm.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both hum]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Bubble Bass, special delivery. ''[shocked]'' Hmm? Okay, Patrick, push it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both grunt]'' ''[bag thuds]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[goes through the back door to pull it]'' ''[becomes muscular]'' ''[destroys the house]'' And that's how you do it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[frightened]'' Uh-oh, Patrick. Look what we did to Bubble Bass's granny's house.}}
{{L|Fruit man|This isn't Bubble Bass's grandmother's house. That is! ''[points to Bubble Bass's grandmother's house]'' This was my house!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, that's a relief. For a minute there, I thought we did something wrong.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Whew.}}
{{L|Fruit man|''[blows up and hat flies down]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both grunt]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks down]'' Don't look down, Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[zips eyes]'' I turned off my eyes. ''[wind gusting]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[whimpers]'' Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh! ''[hiccups]'' Uh-oh, Patrick, I think I have the—  ''[hiccups again]'' Hiccups.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hiccups? I want some. I'm so hungry!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[hiccups again, exclaims]'' Here comes another one, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[blocks SpongeBob's hiccup, grunting]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, buddy. We're almost there. Just a few more steps, and we'll claim that free lunch.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah—  ''[hiccups saying "Hiccup!"]''}}
{{L|''[the bridge collapses, and both grunt]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, this is a dilly of a pickle.}}
{{L|Babies|''[laughter]''}}
{{L|Ms. Mildred|Back it up!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both scream]''}}
{{L|Ms. Mildred|Back it up! Back it up!}}
{{L|Babies|''[laugh]''}}
{{L|Ms. Mildred|''[hits Patrick in the head with a shoe]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both scream]'' Oof, ta-da, Oof.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|I hope you didn't damage my goods.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, your goods are all good, Bubble Bass. And we sure build up an appetite for that free lunch.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[gulps out a bib and fork and knife]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|Oh, yes, about that. I'm afraid I was waiting for you so long that I ''ate them!'' ''[eats the paper bags]'' Mmm. ''[belches]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[whimpers]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[inhales and swallows the fork, knife, and bib. grumbles]'' If my friend SpongeBob doesn't get his free lunch, ''[a realistic close-up of Patrick's face]'' things are gonna get crazy! ''[pants while Bubble Bass melts]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That was the meanest thing I ever saw, Bubble Bass. You, sir, have crossed the line of aquatic decency. You might think you took a couple of bottom feeders like us for a ride today, but I got a newsflash for you, slappy. These bottom-feeders wouldn't eat your free lunch if you paid us.}}
{{L|Patrick|I would.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come, Patrick. I'll make you a free Krabby Patty for $2.50 plus tax.}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[watches the pair leave and laughs]'' Well, you pulled it off, Bubble Bass. And you didn't even have to flick a fin. ''[hums and opens a box]''}}
{{L|Mama Bass|''[emerges from a box and growls]'' Bubble Bass, why do you think it's funny to pack your mother in a box and drag her all over town?!}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|''[shocked]'' Mother?! ''[grunts as she picks him up and stuffs him in two boxes]''}}
{{L|Mama Bass|''[Pulls a dolly out her hair]'' We'll just see how you like it! ''[pants as she pushes him]''}}
{{L|Bubble Bass|I didn't do it! ''[Mama bass bumps into a mailbox]'' Ow! ''[bumps him into a building]'' Mother, please—  ''[grunts]'' It was SpongeBob and Patrick! ''[grunts]'' I'll dry the dishes, Mommy. ''[grunts]'' I love you, Mommy.}}
