{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[At a diner, it is raining outside. A man in a hat with a suit and tie is sitting at the bar, looking for his pen. A waitress pours him some coffee into his cup.]''}}
{{L|Ted|Oh, no, I lost my pen.}}
{{L|''[The Waitress takes a pen out of her hair.]''}}
{{L|Waitress|You can borrow mine.}}
{{L|''[She hands her pen to Ted.]''}}
{{L|Ted|Thanks.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity. ''[the two fish look at SpongeBob then they ignore him]''}}
{{L|Ted|So, anyway, thanks for the pen.}}
{{L|Waitress|No problem, hon.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[walking on the counter]'' It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.}}
{{L|''[Ted looks at his watch.]''}}
{{L|Ted|''[whispers]'' I've gotta go. ''[flashback to Monday morning where SpongeBob is sleeping until his alarm goes off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[jumps up and throws his blanket in the air]'' Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. ''[his blanket lands on his head and he struggles to get it off]'' Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary! ''[SpongeBob puts his foot on the floor to feel around for Gary]'' Gary, are you there? ''[falls on his face. His alarm falls on his head]'' Ow! ''[stands up]'' Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom? ''[shrieks as he falls down the staircase. When he falls into the living room, his alarm clock spits him out]'' Gary? ''[hits one of his windows]'' Gare? ''[slides off the window]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast? ''[grabs a can of snail food then sings and dances]'' The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop! ''[pours the can into Gary's bowl]'' Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like. ''[sticks out his tongue and tastes the snail food but finds it disgusting, sound echoes from his pineapple house]'' Blech! ''[sound echoes through the streets]'' Blech! ''[sound echoes to the Snail Po headquarters]'' Blech!}}
{{L|Sadie|What is it, Peterson?}}
{{L|Peterson|I'm not sure. I feel... a disturbance. ''[cuts back to SpongeBob's house where he is carrying his pants on a hanger]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again. ''[looks at his watch]'' Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work. ''[spins and his pants are on his head]'' Ooh! ''[spins and his pants are in his arm]'' Uh oh. ''[spins and his pants are in the correct place but the collars are missing]'' All right! ''[walks out the door and past Patrick]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hi, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi Patrick! ''[he skips and sings. Scene cuts to the present at the Diner where SpongeBob skips and sings while sitting on a chair]''}}
{{L|Waitress|Wait a minute. When exactly did you lose your identity?}}
{{L|Ted|Yeah, and who's Patrick?}}
{{L|Diner Chef|Why did you eat Snail-Po?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab. ''[cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob opens the door with a food tray in his hand]'' Order up! ''[walks to Debbie]'' One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy.}}
{{L|Debbie|Thanks, uh... ''[looks closely at his shirt]'' Oh.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Is there a problem?}}
{{L|Debbie|Well, you really should be wearing a name tag so I can thank you properly.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here. ''[points to an empty spot on his shirt where his name tag should be]'' Huh? ''[he searches for his name tag then he hyperventilates after he realizes his name tag is missing. Squidward walks up to him]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Uh, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it? ''[SpongeBob imagines a quiet bank and a bank robber bursting in wearing a mask over his head and SpongeBob's name tag]''}}
{{L|Bank Robber|Alright! Nobody move! This is a bank robbery! Attica! ''[cuts back to SpongeBob who screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm innocent, I tell ya! ''[faints then awakens and walks over to Squidward]'' Squidward, what happened?}}
{{L|Squidward|Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh? ''[hyperventilates again]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world? ''[Mr. Krabs comes out of his office]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot! ''[SpongeBob and Squidward stare nervously at Mr. Krabs, who pulls out a big, black boot emitting toxic green fumes]'' This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour. ''[Mr. Krabs zips back into his office. SpongeBob starts hyperventilating again]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[flattered]'' Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[walks off]'' Cover me till I get back, okay?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, sure, sure. ''[chuckles]'' A genius? Well, how about... Hey! ''[cuts to SpongeBob walking down the road]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning. ''[walks by Patrick]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hi, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, hi Patrick. ''[runs back to Patrick]'' You said hi to me this morning, right?}}
{{L|Patrick|As I do every morning.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I need you to do it again.}}
{{L|Patrick|That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, what are you talking about?}}
{{L|Patrick|My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps!}}
{{L|Patrick|You lost your name tag? ''[hyperventilates like SpongeBob does. Scene cuts to SpongeBob poking his head out his window and Patrick standing outside his house]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?}}
{{L|Patrick|I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say "hi", just like this morning.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up. ''[climbs in bed]'' I sure hope this works. ''[pretends to go to sleep then jumps up]'' Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it! ''[blanket falls on his head which causes him to fall and his alarm clock to fall on him again]'' So far, so good. ''[falls down the staircase and lands in his living room. The alarm clock shoots him out]'' I don't see my name tag up here. ''[smacks into his window then slides off of it to Gary]'' Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast? ''[grabs a can of Snail-Po and sings]'' The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way. ''[pours the food into Gary's bowl, then tastes it]'' Blech! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick. ''[walks by Patrick, outside, but he doesn't say anything]'' Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You were supposed to say hi to me!}}
{{L|Patrick|Hi. ''[SpongeBob gets shocked]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh. All right, let's take it from the top. ''[walks off]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hi, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't forget your line this time!}}
{{L|Patrick|I won't.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. ''[falls down the staircase, hits the window, and slides to Gary]'' The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Blech. ''[walks by Patrick who, again, says nothing, and SpongeBob growls in anger]'' Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?!}}
{{L|Patrick|What's my motivation?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[angrily]'' Forget the motivation! Just say hi! Ugh! ''[runs off. Cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again; SpongeBob falls off his bed, then falls off his stairs, then is spat out by his alarm, then hits his window. Cuts again to outside]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry. ''[laughs. SpongeBob walks off]'' I'm sorry. Let's try it again. ''[Cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again; SpongeBob falls off his bed, then falls off his stairs, then hits his window, then tastes Gary's food which disgusts him again. Cuts again to outside]'' Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai... ''[laughs]'' Who's SpongeBoob?! I said SpongeBoob! ''[SpongeBob walks off]'' Again, again. Sorry people.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. The first frame appears, SpongeBob falls off his bed; the second frame appears, SpongeBob falls off his stairs; the third frame appears, SpongeBob is about to feed Gary]'' The most important meal of the day la-la-la Gary's way. ''[the fourth and final frame appears, SpongeBob hits his window]'' Blech!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Cuts to outside, where Patrick is trying not to laugh]'' I've got the giggles.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmm, let's see. ''[imagines what he did today in his thought bubble]'' I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins... ''[Old Man Jenkins honks his horn]''}}
{{L|Thought SpongeBob|Hi, Mr. J.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|...placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... ''[thought ends]'' and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster. ''[cuts to SpongeBob being thrown into a dumpster by the Krusty Krab. He laughs]'' Good one, guys! ''[tries getting up but slips into the garbage again]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|Patrick|That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, then we'll look in the dumpster! ''[cuts to the dumpster outside the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Eh, what is that stench?}}
{{L|Patrick|That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost. ''[gets on all fours]'' Hop on, pal.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[jumps in the dumpster]'' Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it.}}
{{L|Patrick|I wish I had a nose.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine.}}
{{L|Patrick|Cannonball! ''[does a cannonball and jumps to the dumpster. He spits some dirt out and laughs; his teeth are filled with filth]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You look over there and I'll look over here.}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay. ''[digs through the trash while throwing some on SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm looking. I'm looking.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick? Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[digs even faster]'' I'm looking as fast as I can.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick! ''[Patrick stops and turns around to see SpongeBob covered in garbage]'' Thank you. ''[Patrick pulls trash off of SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Have you ''[throws all the garbage away in anger]'' forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag.}}
{{L|Patrick|Could I have another hint?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks at the viewers and blinks twice]'' Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got ''[looks at his watch]'' one minute till inspection. ''[screams and jumps]'' One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time. ''[digs quicker]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[notices a name tag on the back of SpongeBob's shirt]'' Hey, SpongeBob...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not now, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|I know where your name tag is. ''[SpongeBob turns around]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Where?! Where?!}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh... I can't remember.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, I don't have time for this! ''[turns back around]''}}
{{L|Patrick|There it is!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[turns around again]'' Where?!}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh... ''[SpongeBob becomes angry]'' I forgot again.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, are you with me or against me?}}
{{L|Patrick|Could you give me a hint? ''[SpongeBob simply turns back around]'' There! I see it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[turns around, angry]'' Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My shirt backward... ''[looks at his clothes]'' What the...? ''[bends his head back to his back]'' My shirt's on backwards! ''[Patrick looks at him]'' I had my identity all along. ''[spins his shirt around and looks at his watch]'' Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick. ''[shakes hands with Patrick]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[shakes hands with SpongeBob]'' Don't mention it, buddy. ''[cuts to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Fall in for inspection! All right, you two... ''[inspects Squidward]'' Hat and uniform seem to be in order. ''[notices a few hairs in Squidward's nose]'' Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hoorah.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[moves to SpongeBob, who is stinky because of the dumpster]'' Okay, boy, your turn.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[salutes]'' I think you'll find everything shipshape.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sniffs SpongeBob and he covers his nose because he smells bad]'' Ack! Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh... discovery? ''[Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob and sets him outside. Flashback ends and cuts back to the diner]'' And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story. ''[Ted yawns while the waitress checks her watch]''}}
{{L|Waitress|Well, you managed to kill eleven minutes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Thanks, uh... ''[looks at her name tag]'' Betty.}}
{{L|Waitress|What? ''[looks down at her name tag]'' Oh, sweetie, I'm not Betty. I just borrowed her uniform while mine's at the cleaners. ''[SpongeBob looks at the camera, confused]''}}
