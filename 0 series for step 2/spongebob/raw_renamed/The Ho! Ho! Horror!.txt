{{L|Santa|''[gasps]'' Bikini Bottom! Second happiness town in the sea! I don't remember ever delivering toys from a place called Bikini Bottom before. ''[gasps]'' could I have missed a town? I've never missed a town since 1921 ''[laughs]'' and that was a ghost town, nobody saw it. ''[throws newspaper]'' Ooh It says here that all the kids are staying at the Kamp Koral summer camp, and there all asleep. Oh those poor toyless tods. ''[puts on suit]'' Get ready kids, cause Santa is coming to camp! I hope. Away!}}
