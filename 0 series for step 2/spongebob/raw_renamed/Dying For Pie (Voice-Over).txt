{{L|Tom Kenny|Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.}}
{{L|Rodger Bumpass|Why are you still here?}}
{{L|Tom Kenny|Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make a new one! We should be able to finish by January. I already filled this book with ideas.}}
{{L|Rodger Bumpass|Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!}}
{{L|Tom Kenny|You want me to explode?}}
{{L|Rodger Bumpass|Yes! That's what I have been waiting for!}}
{{L|Tom Kenny|Um, okay. I'll try. ''[pretends to explode]'' Gary, you are gonna finish your dessert and you are gonna like it! ''[laughs]'' Now it's your turn.}}
{{L|Rodger Bumpass|That's not what I meant, you barnacle-head!}}
{{L|Tom Kenny|Ooh, good one.}}
{{L|Rodger Bumpass|No! No! You're supposed to explode into a million pieces!}}
{{L|Tom Kenny|Why would I do that?}}
{{L|Rodger Bumpass|Because the pie you ate was a bomb.}}
{{L|Tom Kenny|What pie?}}
{{L|Rodger Bumpass|The one I left sitting on the counter this morning, that I bought from the pirates from 25 bucks... ''that'' pie!}}
{{L|Tom Kenny|The pie? Oh! You mean ''this'' pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat. Oops!}}
{{L|Rodger Bumpass|''[making a booming noise]'' Ouch.}}
