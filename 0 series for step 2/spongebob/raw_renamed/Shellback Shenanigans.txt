{{L|''[episode starts at the Krusty Krab at night]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[flips sign from "open" to "closed]'' Good night, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Closing time already?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I just served a Krabby Patty to the last customer.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, have a good night, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, is it okay if I buy a Krabby Patty to go for my pet snail Gary?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I thought those things ate mostly kibble.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's a special treat. Just to get him ready for tomorrow...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh! Right! Okay, that makes- Wait, what's tomorrow?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' Mr. Krabs, did you forget?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Probably.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Tomorrow is "Bring Your Pet To Work" day!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I don't need a special day for that. Squidward's here every day!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[stands in the doorway]'' Nice. ''[walks away]'' Real nice!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Umm... can I buy that patty?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah, sure.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Alright! Gary's gonna be so excited!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, SpongeBob! I almost forgot. The price is double for pets because they're so special.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good idea! ''[gives Mr. Krabs some change]'' Thanks again, Mr. Krabs! ''[leaves, then pops out of nowhere]'' Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs| Whoa, what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[speaking gibberish]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What, what?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're all out of Krabby Patties!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Did you check the freezer?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, the extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What about the freezer in the attic?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We don't have an attic.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No attic?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You sold it, remember?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, yeah.}}
{{L|''[Plankton and Karen are spying on Krabs and SpongeBob from the Chum Bucket with a telescope]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Now what are they saying, Karen? Karen?!}}
{{L|Karen|I have no idea.}}
{{L|Plankton|What? I thought you said you could read lips!}}
{{L|Karen|I can, but you took my telescope away!}}
{{L|''[Plankton gives the telescope to Karen]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[in the telescope]'' Well, that settles it, SpongeBob. We're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A fresh batch?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That's what I said. A fresh batch of Krabby Patties.}}
{{L|Plankton|Okay, now what's he saying?}}
{{L|Karen|He said that they're going to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.}}
{{L|Plankton|A fresh batch ofâ€”ooh, this is good. This is really good!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|When are we making this fresh batch of Krabby Patties, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What?}}
{{L|Plankton|Okay, what'd he just say?}}
{{L|Karen|What?}}
{{L|Plankton|I said, "What'd he just say?"}}
{{L|Karen|He said, "What?"}}
{{L|Plankton|I have no idea, that's why I'm asking you what he just said!}}
{{L|Karen|I know that, and I'm saying he said, "What?"!}}
{{L|Plankton|I know that! Wait... oh, he said, "What?".}}
{{L|Karen|Yes!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, a whole new fresh batch of Krabby Patties! Gary's gonna go crazy!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You know, SpongeBob, heh, might not be such a good idea bringing a dirty snail into the kitchen. I think we might just want to reschedule "Bring Your Pet To Work" day.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No! Mr. Krabs, I promise that Gary will be sparkly clean. I'll give him an extra long bath tonight!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, okay. Just make sure he's healthy and clean!}}
{{L|Plankton|Healthy and Clean, Fresh Batch of Krabby Patties? Ooh, I think I smell a plan!}}
{{L|''[Bubbles change the scene showing SpongeBob's house]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gary! I brought you a delicious treat!}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|There you are, Gare-bear. I brought you some kelp fries. ''[holds a bag and shakes it upside down. A plate of kelp fries falls out and Gary sniffs them]'' I was going to bring you a Krabby Patty, but we ran out! I'll go get your bath ready, while you enjoy those. ''[Gary gets scared and runs away while SpongeBob fills the bath tub]'' Gary! Your bath is ready! Gary? Gary? ''[eats a kelp fry]'' Gary? ''[walks in the kitchen''] Gary?! ''[sees Gary hiding under the counter]'' Gary, not again. Come out of there, it's dirty! ''[grabs Gary]'' Gotcha! Come on, Gary, quit messing arou.... ''[tries to pull him out but accidentally trips and Gary flies into a pot on top of the refrigerator and is covered in mud]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[upset]'' Great, Gary, just great. Now you're gonna need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath! You're not gonna come down from there, are you?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow. ''[No]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ugh! You win, we'll bathe you in the morning. ''[flicks off the light and leaves; bubbles change the scene. Gary hears a knock on the door and comes to answer it]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[in a disguise wearing a wig and has a suitcase]'' Good morning, sir! My name is Sheldon R. Shellcleaner, owner and operator of Super Shell Cleaner Vacations Unlimited. Can I ask you a question? Are you tired of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[offscreen]'' Gary! I'm going to start the bath!}}
{{L|Plankton|Look, I'll just cut to the chase. Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|Plankton|Of course you do! That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer. For not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here! ''[opens his suitcase and a large poster pops out]'' At Club Shell! A perfect resort for snails. Don't try to pinch yourself, this could be...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[offscreen]'' Gary! The bath is ready!}}
{{L|Plankton|...all yours! Now I know what you're thinking, but I got you covered! ''[shows Gary an orange inflatable shell]'' A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge, of course.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[offscreen]'' Gary! Your bath is ready!}}
{{L|''[Gary immediately puts on the shell and leaves]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Have a pleasant stay! Bon voyage! ''[closes the door and takes off the disguise, goes into Gary's real shell, and puts small balls on his antennas, making him look like Gary, then laughs]'' If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet, I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch! Then I can copy the formula and destroy Krabs once and for all!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[appears walking next to Plankton in the shell and mistakes him for Gary]'' Ah-ha, there you are, Gare-Bear! ''[picks him up and walks up the stairs]'' Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for "Bring your pet to work" day! And today is the day! ''[goes to the bath tub and drops "Gary" in the tub]'' First, I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!}}
{{L|Plankton|Wha...? ''[gets squirted with the gel and is covered in shampoo]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, smells nice, doesn't it?}}
{{L|Plankton|Ugh...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[takes "Gary" and holds him above his head]'' Prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime! ''[scrubs Plankton by dragging him back and forth like a sponge]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[stops scrubbing him]'' Bet that feels good, huh?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[coughs and chokes]'' Curses! I mean... meow?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[nervous]'' Gary, are you sure you're feeling alright?}}
{{L|Plankton|I've never felt better! Uh, I mean... meow! ''[soap washes off and reveals his body to SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[worried]'' Gary! You're turning green! And talking!}}
{{L|Plankton|No, I'm not.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[rushes down the stairs holding "Gary"]'' We gotta get you to the pet hospital!}}
{{L|Plankton|Pet hospital?! But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?! I mean, meow!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're right! I'll call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm gonna be late. Gary, you're a lot more talkative when you're sick. ''[Bubbles change the scene showing the hospital. To Sadie]'' Excuse me, nurse. My snail has been talking and turning green. Is he sick?}}
{{L|''[Sadie takes a look at "Gary"]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[afraid she might notice it's him]'' Meow? ''[Sadie throws bottles of medicine on the ceiling while shrieking in horror]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Is that yes? Or no?}}
{{L|Sadie|I have never seen such a drastic case! Rush this snail to the intensive care unit stat!}}
{{L|Plankton|Intensive care unit?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, Gary. These are professionals.}}
{{L|''[Bubbles change the scene and Plankton is sitting on a bed]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[sees a large computer, thinking it's Karen]'' Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.}}
{{L|Sadie |''[walks in the room]'' Don't worry. We're just going to subject you to a series of invasive tests. It'll be over before you know it. ''[pulls a curtains and we hear Plankton screaming in pain while the screen shows the hospital. SpongeBob breathes heavily thinking about "Gary"]''}}
{{L|Jennifer-Millie|Sir, all the doctor is saying is that your snail is still in the intensive care unit, and we just need to run a couple more tests.}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|''[to Jennifer]'' That's not what I'm saying at all.}}
{{L|SpongeBob| Oh, Gary! ''[crying]''}}
{{L|Purple Doctorfish|''[to SpongeBob]'' Yes, I'll be honest with you, son, we've tried everything we can. We just can't find out anything wrong with him. I've never seen anything like it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Please try to save him, doctor!}}
{{L|''[Cut to Plankton]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[sleeps on the bed, then wakes up paranoid]'' No! No more! Please! I-I-I-I...}}
{{L|Sadie|Relax, Gary, the tests are over. I'm just here to give you a little pill.}}
{{L|Plankton|Whew! That's a relief.}}
{{L|Sadie|''[takes out a giant pill bigger than Plankton]'' Now, open wide. ''[Plankton screams as Sadie puts the pill in his mouth]''}}
{{L|Sadie|That wasn't so bad, was it? ''[Plankton has the pill in his mouth, tears up, and spits out the pill all over her]'' That's not good. ''[Cuts to SpongeBob still crying]'' Uh, Mr. SquarePants?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[stops crying and heads over to "Gary" who is covered up in bandages]'' Gary!}}
{{L|Sadie|The doctor says there's nothing more we can do. It's best to take him home and let nature take its course.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're- you're saying that he's... that he might... oh. ''[Sadie walks away]'' Nurse? Nurse?! Oh, well, Gary, this looks like it might be...''[sniffles]''... the end. ''[wails]''}}
{{L|Plankton|If I could just have a... ''[coughs]'' Krabby Patty before I go...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure thing, little buddy, sure. ''[sniffs]'' Y'know, it's... it's really poignant.}}
{{L|Plankton|What is?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, now that you can talk, we're... we're running out of time to say I love you! ''[continues wailing and crying]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[sighs]'' Oh, boy...}}
{{L|''[Bubbles change the scene to the bus Gary is on]''}}
{{L|Tourist|So, once again, we'd like to thank you for choosing Club Shell, and we hope to see you again real soon.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[carries "Gary"]'' Just a little further, Gare-Bare.}}
{{L|Gary|''[looks out the window]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes!}}
{{L|''[Gary pulls busline angrily and slithers over to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[puts "Gary" down on the floor next to the grill]'' Buddy, you just stay right here, and Daddy's gonna go get the secret formula and whip you up the best batch that we ever whipped up. Be right back, Gare-Bear. ''[walks away gloomily]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes, SpongeFool, come right back with your complete undoing and victory will be mine!}}
{{L|''[Gary slithers to Plankton angrily and growls at him]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Mommy? Hey, wait!}}
{{L|''[Gary beats Plankton up, while Mr. Krabs hears this, and he sees Plankton running out the door]''}} 
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Plankton? ''[finds out Gary beat him out of the restaurant and has an idea. Bubbles change the scene. Gary is at the Krusty Krab door letting people in, then Plankton, in a costume, comes up to Gary]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Good day, sir. I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare. ''[Gary growls]'' Whoa, there, fido! ''[screams and runs away]'' I'm going! I'm going already!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer, huh, Mr. Krabs? Really earning his pay.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, he takes after you, boy. ''[surprised]'' Pay?!}}
