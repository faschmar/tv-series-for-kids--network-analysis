{{L|''[Episode starts at the Discount Grocery Mart, Mr. Krabs places a basket of items on the counter and Debbie scans them.]''}}
{{L|Debbie|Price check on industrial size econo pack of raw fiber.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ah, it goes in like steel wool, but comes out like an angel from heaven.}}
{{L|Debbie|''[sarcastically]'' Please, tell me more.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ooh, well, this one time I...}}
{{L|Debbie|Not really!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I didn't think so. Ooh, wait, I almost forgot me coupons! ''[hands her a lot of coupons]'' There's a couple double ones in there, too.}}
{{L|Debbie|Sir, these expired over 30 years ago.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What does that mean?}}
{{L|Debbie|It means they're no good, sir. I'll just throw those away for you.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No, wait! I'll take 'em.}}
{{L|Debbie|Okay, sir, your change today is going to be exactly ten cents.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Come to papa! Come to papa! ''[two nickels slide out]'' Yay! Two nickels. ''[laughs, then gasps as he notices SpongeBob walking on the street]'' Hey, that's SpongeBob out there! ''[SpongeBob does some weird things]'' What in blue blazes is that boy up to? ''[SpongeBob points to something that appears to be a penny. Two fish passing by look at him. SpongeBob picks it up and puts it in his pocket]'' Well, I'll be a geriatric jellyfish! SpongeBob found a penny! A bright shiny penny just sitting there, and he picked it right up! Huh, I can remember the whole thing as if it just happened a moment ago. ''[Mr. Krabs imagines what just happened]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in the thought bubble]'' Sir? Sir?! ''[it is actually Debbie]''}}
{{L|Debbie|...Sir?! ''[thought bubble disappears]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What?}}
{{L|Debbie|You're holding up the line.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[a long line of angry fish is shown]'' Ooh, I am? ''[he leaves]''}}
{{L|Debbie|Next, please. ''[cuts to night where Mr. Krabs is driving his boat]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Interesting how things work out that way. Some folks just walk along and stumble over free money, while others, others, they work! ''[zooms out seeing that there's another car next to his and hearing dolphin chirps from Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Billy|Hey, mommy, look at that weird guy in the car over there.}}
{{L|Billy's Mom|Billy, mommy's watching the road right now.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I mean, why couldn't I have just walked along and found it? I have legs, too, you know! ''[sighs]'' How about a little music. ''[music dial turns into a penny. Mr. Krabs gasps and screams]'' Okay, okay, get a grip, Krabs. Just concentrate on driving. ''[steering wheel turns into a penny. Mr. Krabs screams and lets go of it, then holds it again]'' Okay, getting all worked up over a little coin. ''[laughs]'' Ah, it must just be the full moon. Wait a second. ''[the moon turns into a penny, and Mr. Krabs screams]'' I.. gotta... have... that... penny! ''[cuts to next day at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob walks in]'' Good morning, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good morning, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Find anything special lately?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yae-yes!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Really?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yup!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And you want to share it with your old uncle Krabs, don't you, boy?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Of course!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Great! Well, share it with me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' I already am sharing it with you, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wha.. What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The thing I found was a bright, shiny, new... day! Well, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me. ''[talking to Squidward]'' Good morning, Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|Don't talk to me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs seems to be in a good mood today.}}
{{L|Squidward|That counts as talking. ''[SpongeBob walks into the kitchen, and Mr. Krabs is in there]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa! Hello again, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hello, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What can I do you for?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Can I borrow a penny?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A penny? Sure. ''[checks his pocket]'' Hmm, sorry. All out of pennies right now.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But did you check all your pockets?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I thought I did.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Front pockets? ''[SpongeBob checks]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmm, no.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Back? ''[SpongeBob checks]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmm-mm.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Shirt pockets? ''[SpongeBob checks]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nuh-uh.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Shoe pockets?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Shoe pockets. Oh, Mr. Krabs, that is just ridiculous.}}
<font color="red">{{L|Mr. Krabs|It is?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I do have a tie pocket though. ''[SpongeBob checks]'' No, not in there either.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, maybe it fell in your sock.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Did you check there? ''[holds SpongeBob upside down, and shakes him, SpongeBob's brain falls out]'' Uhh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, look, it's my brain! ''[brain grows legs and walks away]'' Hey, where's it going? ''[brain walks through a crack]'' Ooh, there. ''[brain crawls on Squidward, and SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs follow it, they find it under a barrel]'' Aha! ''[brain squirts liquid at him]'' Ugh! ''[SpongeBob laughs. He grabs his brain]'' Not so fast, little guy. There now. Yes, I know. Come here. ''[brain crawls back into SpongeBob's head]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uhh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's the matter, Mr. Krabs? Didn't you know I was a brain whisperer?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So, uhh, no penny, huh?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nope.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Darn!</font> ''[cuts to later when SpongeBob is mopping, and hears a noise]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, these deafening construction sounds are preventing me from working.}}
{{L|Squidward|Me, too.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Do you think we should walk out back to investigate?}}
{{L|Squidward|Never. ''[SpongeBob and Squidward are now walking out back]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The sounds are coming from back here. What the? ''[a movie theater is being built]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Careful with those marquee ladders!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Mr. Krabs, you made your own movie theater!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes, I did.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yay!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|And you're just in time for the grand opening! ''[pulls a lever that turns on the electricity on. Removes his construction hat and wears a magician hat]'' Step right up, folks, and witness a spellbinding tale chock full of adventure, and action, and thrills... ''[Mr. Krabs is chirping like a dolphin as two fish walk up]''}}
{{L|Frank|You know, I'm not really hungry.}}
{{L|Fred|Yeah, let's go see what this fat guy is yelling about.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|...witness the terrifying challenges overcome by... by...}}
{{L|Fred|By who?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|by a... by a plucky young sponge.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Just like me!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That's right! And the best part is: admission is only one penny!}}
{{L|Squidward|Does a movie like that even exist?}}
{{L|Fred|Yeah, does it?!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uhh, well, actually, I was going to show you this flip book and...}}
{{L|Squidward|A flip book?}}
{{L|Fred|Yeah, I don't even know what that is! ''[everyone angrily walks away]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|No, wait. Noooooooo!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, can I see the movie now? Please?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Of course you can, lad! ''[SpongeBob smiles]'' You just gotta give me one penny.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But, but...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But, I really don't have a penny. ''[Mr. Krabs screams, his eye twitches, then he drives a crane with a wrecking ball to demolish the theater. SpongeBob runs off. After demolishing the theater, a puff of smoke flies to Mr. Krabs and pops at his face. Cuts to night where SpongeBob is walking to the Krusty Krab at night]'' Huh, that's too bad. I really wanted to see that movie. ''[enters the Krusty Krab]'' Oh, well. ''[Squidward is dressed like a waiter]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Good evening, ''[SpongeBob whistles]'' and ''[Squidward looks at a piece of paper]'' welcome to the ''[looks at paper]'' Krusty Krab semi-annual charity night.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward? You look beautiful!}}
{{L|Squidward|Let me show you to your table.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My table? Fancy. ''[gasps]'' My very own name tag! ''[lights turn off and Squidward sighs, as he shines a flash light on Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hello, and welcome to a very important evening. Tonight's event is entitled: Pennies, for the penny-less. And before the following images are shown, I would ask each of you to look not look with your eyes, but with your heart. ''[Mr. Krabs shows some images]'' Three dimes, two nickels, one quarter, zero pennies. And since I realize the images seen here tonight may be wretchedly hideous, I am going to tell you what you can do to end this travesty: You can donate one penny to me: Mr. Krabs. Also known as: Mr. Krabs, the man who doesn't have one. ''[Mr. Krabs starts crying and SpongeBob is crying, too]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[cheered up]'' Yes?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I would like to donate a penny.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You would?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|If I only had one! ''[SpongeBob starts crying, Mr. Krabs' eyes go into his head, and he screams. The scene then cuts to SpongeBob's house, Mr. Krabs is using a flower delivery truck to spy on his house, he is speaking gibberish, he notices SpongeBob walking out the door, he walks in, with a metal detector, and then Mr. Krabs looks around]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hiding it, somewhere. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What's that? You! You know where!}}
{{L|Gary|Meow. ''[Mr. Krabs picks him up]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Tell where!}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hiding it, inside, ''[reaches into Gary's shell]'' in there, somewhere. ''[lights come on, and SpongeBob walks in holding a drink]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' Mr. Krabs! What is this metal detector doing on the floor? These should only be stored on special racks. ''[gasps]'' And you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, I just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, that wasn't a penny. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|It wasn't?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. I think it's peppermint.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. I feel so relieved. There was no penny after all! Well, I'll be going now, You can keep the metal detector, SpongeBob. See ya!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Gary, you can play with that. ''[Gary sniffs it, then blows a raspberry at it, and slithers away, the gum then absorbs the spit]'' Hey, this isn't gum at all. ''[pulls it out, revealing that it is a $500 bill]'' It's just a dumb old $500 bill. This won't go with my chewed-up gum collection. Oh, well. Good night, Gary.}} 
{{L|''[turns off the light, then zooms out revealing that Mr. Krabs is digging holes outside of his house looking for the penny]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Penny, he must've buried it around here somewhere. I'll just have to keep digging.}}
