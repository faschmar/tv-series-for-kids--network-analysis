{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[at the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[humming to the radio. Opens the door for a customer who is leaving]'' Oh, thank you for eating at The Krusty Krab. ''[SpongeBob is trying to balance stacks of trays with food on them]'' Can I give you a hand with that, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure. Thanks, Squidward! Gee, looks like playing Kelpy G's music here in the restaurant has really energized him.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow. Kelpy's music is really, um, unique.}}
{{L|Squidward|Kelpy's not for everyone.}}
{{L|D.J.|That was Kelpy G. Taking you on a trip that is out of this ocean. Hope you fellow Kelpheads got your tickets early 'cause his concert tonight at High Tide Stadium is, sorry, sold out.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! Kelpy G is performing tonight, Squidward. But tickets are… ''[in announcer's voice]'' sorry, sold out.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, how could this be? Whatever shall I do?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You forgot to buy a ticket?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh no, I have a ticket. I just don't know what I'll do without you there. ''[snaps]'' Oh wait, I just realized... I'll be having the greatest time of my life!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, may I at least gaze upon your ticket?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh yeah. I show you the ticket, and then through some manner of folly, you destroy it! ''[Patrick swallows ticket]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're probably not gonna get that back before show time.}}
{{L|D.J.|This goes out to all those sad sacks without a ticket to tonight’s concert. We're giving away the last two tickets to one lucky caller.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, the dream is still alive! ''[Squidward rushes over to the phone and dials]''}}
{{L|D.J.|Hey, you are lucky loser number one. Please, try again. Hey, you are lucky loser number five. Please, try again. Hey, you are lucky loser number nine. Please, try again. Twenty-two. Try again. Twenty-seven. Sixty-five.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, come on! Nothing but a scam.}}
{{L|D.J.|Hello! You're winning caller number 102.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I am? ''[Squidward falls over sideways]''}}
{{L|D.J.|Not only have you won two front row seats, but you and a friend will go backstage to meet Kelpy G himself.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Me and a friend. Hmm, I wonder who that will be.}}
{{L|''[cut to later that night]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Can you believe it? We're gonna meet your hero, Kelpy G! ''[shows backstage pass]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Ah, so nice to be surrounded by such kindred spirits.}}
{{L|Female Fan #1|You can say that again. It's a rare treat to mingle with true diehard smooth jazzists.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You said it, lady. I've been a diehard since 10:00 this morning. Who's ready for a Kelpy G concert tonight?!}}
{{L|Male Fan #1|Was it you who brought the raucous miscreant?}}
{{L|Squidward|Me? No. Of course not. No.}}
{{L|Squidward|See all you fellow Kelpheads at the show.}}
{{L|Female Fan #1|Just keep your friend's outbursts under control.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Isn't this so much fun, Squidward? Wow, I love your Kelpy G wig, sir.}}
{{L|Male Fan #2|What wig?}}
{{L|Squidward|Come on, SpongeBob. SpongeBob's obnoxiousness is ostracizing me from all these other fans. Somehow I gotta give him to slip.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa, just look at that lemonade line.}}
{{L|Squidward|That's it. Hang on, SpongeBob. I need a rest. My throat is parched. I sure wish I knew where one could procure some lemonade.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah.}}
{{L|Squidward|I said, I wonder where someone could get some lemonade.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah.}}
{{L|Squidward|It's right behind you SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! Why don't I get one for you?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, no. Dear me. Oh, no. I could not have you wait in that long line, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's no problem, Squidward, really, I—}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, okay, if you insist.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Alright. One lemonade, coming up.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[chuckles]'' See you after the show, Spongee-G.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[a few Squids are snapping at some jazz music]'' Ah, "Turquoise Scallop Sun Dance." I just love this tune.}}
{{L|Male Fan #3|Hey hey, a fellow mellow jazz-dazzler. What's happening?}}
{{L|Squidward|Just grooving to the soothing waves of the Gentle G.}}
{{L|Male Fan #3|I'm picking up what you're laying down. You can groove with us any time.}}
{{L|Squidward|Don't mind if I do groove.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughing]'' Look what I found!}}
{{L|Squidward|What the…? What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Guess what? There's a second lemonade stand! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, nice tune. ''[gets out ukulele]'' Nothing like a little accompaniment meant to bring out the genius of Kelpy's kazoo playing, huh, guys?}}
{{L|Male Fan #3|Kazoo? Your friend knows absolutely nothing of Kelpy G, man!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you friends with Squidward?}}
{{L|Male Fan #3|Friends? I should think not. We only associate with true jazz-dazzlers.}}
{{L|Squidward|But I dazzle. Oh.}}
{{L|''[cut to later at concert. Squidward and SpongeBob sit in front row]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoo! Kelpy, yeah! Put your hands together, people.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, boy.}}
{{L|Female Fan #2|Hey, Sponge! Would you just sit down and shut your mouth?}}
{{L|Male Fan #4|Well, thank you for speaking up. ''[indistinct chatter from everyone else]''}}
{{L|Announcer|Hello, all you snazzy jazzlers. Please put your thumbs and forefingers together and give a warm welcome to the pied piper of jazz himself— Kelpy G. ''[he comes out and plays some jazz on his clarinet]''}}
{{L|Male Fan #5|Bravo! Bravo! It's so exciting!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow!}}
{{L|Squidward|Such immaculate music. It's the very voice of Neptune himself.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[pokes Squidward's head]'' Excuse me, sir, do you have any ketchup?}}
{{L|Squidward|No I don't — ketchup?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, what brought you here?}}
{{L|Patrick|Two words, SpongeBob— "na" "chos."}}
{{L|Squidward|Two words, Patrick— "get lost."}}
{{L|Patrick|''[points to Squidward's backstage pass]'' What's that?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, no, you don't, Patrick. You stay away from my backstage pa— huh? ''[Patrick is swallowing the backstage pass. Squidward deflates]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's okay, Squidward, you're the biggest Kelpy G fan I know. Please, take my backstage pa— ''[Patrick takes it and swallows it. He burps and his stomach growls]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Tummy want more. ''[walks off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, boy.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[gets extremely angry]'' I'm going to get those passes back even if I have to rip Patrick in half. ''[rips his head in half]'' What the...?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[goes up on stage and takes the microphone]'' I would like two extra cheesy nachos with a side of cheese and two vanilla coral shakes. ''[crowd booing]'' Actually, make that two cheese coral shakes. And instead of whipped cream on top, I'll take cream cheese on the bottom. That's it for now. ''[two stage security fish get on either side of Patrick]''}}
{{L|Security Fish #1|Get 'im! ''[they both jump into each other as Patrick jumps off the stage and crowd surfs]''}}
{{L|Male Fan #6|You're so light.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey, come back here with those backstage passes.}}
{{L|Crew Member|Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where do you think you're going?}}
{{L|Squidward|But our friend just took our—}}
{{L|Crew Member|Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't care about the whosits or the whatsits. Clear the aisle and go back to your seat. ''[they do so]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, well, at least we still have our seats. ''[a giant squid is sitting in both seats. Squidward gets angry]''}}
{{L|Big Squid|You got a problem, tentacle head?}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah, I got a problem. Those are my seats, you numbskull. I'm gonna rant for a while. You're just gonna sit there, aren't ya? ''[Kelpy G stops his jazz]'' You're not gonna move along. We waited long and hard for this— ''[security grabs Squidward and toss both him and SpongeBob out of the concert. Squidward sobs]'' Tonight's ruined. A complete disaster. And I didn't even meet Kelpy G.}}
{{L|Patrick|Keep it jazzy, Miles. And thanks for the grub. ''[Squidward and SpongeBob run inside the backstage door]''}}
{{L|Squidward|We're in, SpongeBob. Now I'll finally get to meet the incomparable Kelpy G. ''[runs into the manager]''}}
{{L|Milo J. Fingerfish|Hey, this is a private area. Only people with backstage passes can come back here.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, well, you see, sir, we had backstage passes. But my friend ate them with his nachos, then he dove off the stage and got carried away by the audience.}}
{{L|Milo J. Fingerfish|What are you talking about? I'm Kelpy G's manager. Now read my lips. ''[Squidward literally does so]''}}
{{L|Squidward|"No backstage passes, no entry."}}
{{L|Milo J. Fingerfish|And no seeing Kelpy G, got it?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, please, please, let me see him. Please. Please. Please!}}
{{L|Milo J Fingerfish|Get up, man. Have some dignity.}}
{{L|Squidward|But, but, but… what if I told you, uh… I'm a clarinet player myself. ''[manager groans]'' I call this one, "Ninth Movement, A Kaleidoscope of Stars." Wait. Hold for it. ''[inhales and plays off-key]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! Oh! ''[gets out his ukulele and plays. Squidward plays his clarinet in SpongeBob's face. The manager groans again. Back at the stage, Kelpy G gets finished]''}}
{{L|Crew Member|Right this way, Mr. G.}}
{{L|Kelpy G|Another show, another intermission.}}
{{L|Crew Member|Your dressing room is right over here, sir.}}
{{L|Kelpy G|Hold on a smooth second.}}
{{L|Crew Member|Ugh! Who let those two back here? That sounds horrible. I'll get 'em right out.}}
{{L|Kelpy G|No, no. I agree, the clarinet sound abysmal, but that ukulele. Genius. And his clogs. They're just like mine, see? Excuse me, young man.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hello, Kelpy. It's great to finally meet— ''[Kelpy pushes him away]''}}
{{L|Kelpy G|And what might you be called?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|SpongeBob SquarePants.}}
{{L|Kelpy G|Come, young protege, let us woo the crowd with sounds of heavenly delight. ''[crowd is softly chanting "Kelpy"]'' At this time, I'd like to welcome a very special guest to the stage — Mr. SpongeBob SmoothPants. ''[SpongeBob and Kelpy play their instruments at the same time and the crowd loves it]''}}
{{L|Squidward|This isn't fair. I should be on stage, not SpongeBob. I'm the mega-talent. I'll show you, Kelpy. ''[security takes Squidward away]'' But I'm a musician!}}
