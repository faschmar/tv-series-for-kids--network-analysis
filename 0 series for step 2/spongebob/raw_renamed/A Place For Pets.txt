{{L|''[The episode opens up to a shot of the Krusty Krab zooming in towards the front entrance with Fred walking into the restaurant. It then transitions to inside the restaurant where we see customers eating and Squidward delivering food to tables.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Order for...}}w
{{L|''[Incidentals 41 and 42 show looks of excitement as they quickly snatch their food from the plate Squidward is holding. It then shows them eating their food like a bunch of slobs and getting Soda all over Squidward.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Eugh, oh. Disgusting. You people eat like animal... animal... achoo!}}
{{L|''[Squidward sneezes and it causes him to slam his head into the plate getting the two soda cups getting stuck in his eyes. He then pushes his eyes through the bottom of the soda cups and uses them as binoculars as he looks at the table next to him.]''}}
{{L|Ms. Mildred|Oh, there's my baby. Oh, my little baby!}}
{{L|''[Ms. Mildred feeds her pet worm who is coming out of her purse a small Krabby Patty. Squidward then pulls the soda cups off of his eyes which results in his eyeballs becoming small. He then walks over to Ms. Mildred's table.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh no. You cannot bring a worm in here. It's unclean! And some of us are allergi... Achoo!}}
{{L|''[Squidward then hits his head on the table as Ms. Mildred and her worm look at him very surprised. Mr. Krabs then rushes onscreen.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What's with all the sniffy fits out here, Mr. Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|It's not my fault, Mr. Krabs! She snuck a pet into the restaurant!}}
{{L|Ms. Mildred|Oh! I didn't know my sweet little Fifi wasn't allowed.}}
{{L|''[Fifi then whines at Mr. Krabs with a sad face and then Squidward sneezes all over both Mr. Krabs and Fifi resulting in her hair flying onto Mr. Krabs's eyestalks. Fifi then strains and manages to make her hair to grow back instantly.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, your sweet little Foo-Foo is gotta go, we got a strict policy, ''[points at sign]'' no pets allowed.}}
{{L|Mrs. Mildred|What a shame, Krabby Patties are all my Fee-Fee will eat these days, I would have gladly paid double the price, if it only meant she could have her favorite food...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Huh? ''[changes the sign]'' There. all fixed! ''[shows Mrs. Mildred the sign]'' See? Now: Pets, Allowed!}}
{{L|Mrs. Mildred|Oh! How delightful!}}

{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hee hee! I tell ya, Mr. Squidward, I'm making more money than Neptune! Hee hee hee! ''[Squidward sneezes]''}}
{{L|Health Inspector|Hold it right there, Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh no, the health inspector!}}
{{L|Health Inspector|Oh yes, the health inspector! And I'm afraid, you can't run a restaurant and a feed lot out of the same building! It's unsanitary. I'm shutting you down! Unless you pick one. People or pets.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ohh. Ooh! Ooh! Oh, yeah! I choose pets!}}
{{L|Squidward|What?! No!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Alright, you heard the man. If you ain't a pet, you're tresspassing. Time to go! Get a move on.}}
