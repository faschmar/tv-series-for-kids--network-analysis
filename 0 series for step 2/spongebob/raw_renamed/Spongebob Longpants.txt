{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[pans out from Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy "The Dark Tide Rises" poster]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! Another Mermaid Man reboot. It's how I always re-imagined the reboot would be remade,}}
{{L|''[wind blows]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[shivers]'' Oh, cold knees!}}
{{L|''[Salesfish drives by, then parks his boat and jumps out with a suitcase]''}}
{{L|Salesfish|Well you see you got cold knees, icy joints, Siberian patellas? What you need is a pair of longpants!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Longpants? ''[twists around looking at the pants spin around him]'' Well, I don't think I'm ready for looong pants.}}
{{L|Salesfish|Nonsense, no fellers like you walk around with shiver shins! ''[shows SpongeBob's knees with icicles popping out]'' Give yourself something to leg up ''[pulls SpongeBob's legs]'' Join the trouser troupe! ''[three businessmen marching and hutting]'' Don't be a slacker, wear slacks!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh..well..I don't...uhhh...Okay! ''[peels off his old pants and jumps into the longpants]'' How do I look?}}
{{L|Salesfish|''[takes hat off]'' Excuse me, sir, I was just talking to a little baby schoolboy a second ago, about yay high and...''[puts hat on and jumps up]'' ''[stutters]'' It's you! I didn't recognize you with your mature, grownup longpants!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're pulling my leg, sir, I don't look like a man! Do I?}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, man!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[jumps]'' He called me a man! And my knees are a perfect 72 degrees! ''[pulls out wallet and hands salesfish money]''}}
{{L|Salesfish|''[walks away with money, bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Customers|''[gasp, talking about SpongeBob's pants while SpongeBob is walking to his workstation]''}}
{{L|Customer's son|Is that my daddy?}}
{{L|Customer's mother|I wish! ''[gawking at SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uhh, excuse me, sir, that door is for employees only, ohh! It's SpongeBob! ''[sniffs SpongeBob]'' There's something different about you today? You seem more, able bodied.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yah, it must be the long pants! ''[in manly tone]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So they are! You'll run the register today! ''[grabs Squidward]'' Into the galley with you, Mr. Squidward, and start cooking!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sadly]'' But, Mr. Krabs? Why?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, look, SpongeBob's got longpants on and you've got.. none! ''[Krustomers ooh]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[covers himself, Mr. Krabs throw Squidward into the kitchen, glass shatters, bubble transitions to SpongeBob at the register]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ohh! I could get used to this job! Hey Squidward what's on sale this week?}}
{{L|Squidward|Nothing, there is never a sale.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pokes head through the serving window]'' Squidward, how much is the senior discount?}}
{{L|Squidward|There's no senior discount! ''[looks at burning patties, throws patty onto foot, burns his foot, and grunting and hitting and breaking everything because of the pain]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[screams]'' What?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What do I do when the register is $2000 short?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Alright, alright, that's enough! ''[picks up SpongeBob and puts him outside of the register]'' I see it was a mistake to put you behind the register! You’re just looking to good for such a simple meaning of work!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[grunts angrily]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You should be the maitre'd! Greeting customers when they come in! Charming the pants off of everyone with your longpants!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Okay! ''[walks around Krusty Krab, saying hi to everyone]'' How is that patty treating you, sir? ''[teeth glisten]''}}
{{L|Blue customer|Are you an angel?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, merely a man, a man in longpants. ''[elderly spits out soda, missing the longpants, people are spitting food everywhere, just missing SpongeBob's pants, until a ketchup drop stains his pantleg]'' Oh, my precious longpants!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What's wrong, slick? Your not having trouble with your pants, are ye?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Nothing like that, Mr. Krabs. I just don't think I'm maitre'd material.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah, you're right, you're too good for this place. ''[two customers burp]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|As much as I hate to admit it, I've outgrown the Krusty Krab. Time for me to move on! ''[pulls up pants, leaves The Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Where's he going?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|A place called... manhood. ''[bubble transitions to SpongeBob walking on the streets]''}}
{{L|Nancy Suzy Fish|Doris, I insist! ''[puts hand on check]''}}
{{L|Doris|Don't be silly!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Allow me, ladies, I should pay, after all, I am a man, and I'm wearing...''[whistles, points at longpants]''}}
{{L|Nancy Suzy Fish|What an inseam!}}
{{L|Doris|And those pleats were pretty easy on the eyes!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[boat splashes water on his pants]'' AH! Shrimp! Oh, dry cleaning, and one hour! ''[walks into dry cleaners]''}}
{{L|Dave|Uh, ticket please.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Has it all ready been one hour? One more time! ''[goes back into the dry cleaning cycle, bubble transitions to SpongeBob at a window, with SpongeBob looking at himself, whistles]'' Huh? ''[click, car stops]''}}
{{L|Driving Instructor|Congratulations, you passed your driving test!}}
{{L|Mable Jenkins/Lobster|Wahoo!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You know, I've never took the drivers test with long pants! I'll do it!}}
{{L|Alternate Universe SpongeBob|There goes a real man! ''[bubble transition to SpongeBob taken the drivers test]''}}
{{L|Driving Instructor|Let's try parallel parking. ''[SpongeBob trying to parallel park]'' Now take it slow! A little faster?! ''[SpongeBob crashes into a boat, and then backs up and crashes into the boat behind him several times, driving instructor grunts]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this! ''[boat is upside-down and is on top of another boat]''}}
{{L|Driving Instructor|I was gonna fail you, and send you to jail, but because of those longpants, and all the blood rushing to my head, you passed! ''[hands SpongeBob his license]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I finally got my drivers license!}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[puffs up, sirens wailing]'' Lock your doors, bar your windows, it's the end of the world! ''[bubble transition to Fancy! restaurant]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Help wanted? Now this seems like a longpants establishment! ''[takes off tie, puts on bowtie]'' ''[talking to customers]'' Today's special is a most amusing indian ocean seagrass, handpicked by indigenous prawns, pre-chewed by local manatees, and smothered in a rich, red algae.}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|Extraordinary. And may I add that those are very impressive breeches you are wearing.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Breeches? ''[laughs]'' Oh, oh, these old things?}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|What is your name?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|SpongeBob!}}
{{L|Fancy! Employee|''[grunts]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|'Oh, ''[distinguished accent]'' SpongeRobert.}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|Well, SpongeRobert, how would you like to join us. We're going to a party.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Boy, would I! I love parties! ''[Fancy fish and SpongeBob laughing distinguishably, bubble transition to fancy fish house]'' ''[SpongeBob looking around]''}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|What are you looking for, SpongeRobert?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm looking for the party!}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|This is the party.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[puts on party hat]'' Well, were's all the party hats, were's the cake, and the clown? You can't have a party without a clown!}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|''[fancy fish and the other fancy fish laughing]'' Oh, SpongeRobert, if it weren't for your pants, I'd take you for the type of immature ignaramus that would frequent the Krusty Krab!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait, what's that? ''[car with poster on back drives by]'' The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie is opening tonight! Wow! I totally forgot! ''[goes back inside]'' Hey guys, I got an idea! Let's all go to the Mermaid Man movie!}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|''[laughs]'' You're incorrigible! But le cinema is a delightful idea. There is a foreign film at the arthouse I've been meaning to see. It's called, "The Table." ''[jumpshots to the Seven Seas Cinema, and "The Table"]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't get it. We have been staring at this table for three hours. That table could use a cleaning.}}
{{L|Squidward|SHH! Some people are trying to enjoy le cinema.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! Hey Squidward! Hey, do you understand what this movie is about?}}
{{L|Squidward|Nobody does, it's art, now sit down!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[loudly]'' WHAT?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you remembering to flip the patties clockwise? It's very important because the heat..}}
{{L|Squidward|''[really loud]'' PLEASE SIT DOWN!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob sits back down in his seat.]''}}
{{L|Movie Theater Attendant|''[shines a flashlight in Squidward's face]'' I'm sorry sir, you're being too loud. I am going to have to ask you to leave.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[grumbling as he is walking away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, wait, Squidward, I'll walk you out. ''[Squidward continues to grumble as he exits the theater]'' Squidward!}}
{{L|Sandy|Hey SpongeBob, y'all going to see the Mermaid Man movie with us?}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|SpongeRobert? Yoohoo? Are you coming? We're going to drink some more coffee and watch the nightly news.}}
{{L|Sandy|Wow, that sounds pretty grown up, SpongeRobert!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My pants say yes, yes, yes, but my heart says no! I want to see the Mermaid Man movie!}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|''[laughs]'' Now you really sound like one of those nitwits that frequents the Krusty Krab!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not only am I one of those nitwits, I actually work there! ''[puts on Krusty Krab Hat and hold up dirty Spatula]''}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|Ahh! A peasant in longpants!}}
{{L|Pink Fancy Fish|Social-climbing sponge!}}
{{L|Blue Fancy Fish|Poser!}}
{{L|Fancy Fish|Let's leave this bottomfeeder.}}
{{L|Sandy|That-a-boy! I got you a ticket just in case!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasp]'' Really! ''[Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick give ticketman their tickets, and enter the movie theatre, but SpongeBob is stopped]''}}
{{L|Ticketman|I'm sorry, you can't come in. This movie is too silly for a cultivated gentleman of your pants length. House rules! ''[SpongeBob walks over to movie poster]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What? Rated for those in knee-highs only? Doh! I hate these pants! [''tries to undo zipper, grunts while doing]'' ''[SpongeBob runs to a parking meter and puts his longpants on it, and and stretches his pants]'' Get off! ''[a car hits his elongated pants]'' Oh!, now I know I'm an adult because I've been ripped off by these defective pants! ''[cries, Mr. Krabs comes out of the movie theater]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What's goin' on? How pathetic, a man, in longpants, crying.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sobbing voice]'' Mr. Krabs, why aren't you watching the movie?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|How can I watch the movie with all this blubbering going on out here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[regular voice]'' Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm not ready for long pants, I want my short pants back, but I can't because these are stuck on me.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, for Pete's sake. ''[uses his pinchers to snap of SpongeBob's legs, knee down] ''Sorry 'bout the legs boyo.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' It's okay! I'm a sponge, remember? ''[legs grow back]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' Well, good! Now, I want you back on the grill tomorrow morning. And if it makes you feel anymore manly, you can do your grilling outdoors!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sounds great! And I'll be driving to work.}}
{{L|Driving Instructor|Wait a minute! ''[he drives up]'' Oh no you don't! Not with those short pants! ''[takes the driving license and rips it up]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|''[in her bedroom with rations and in hunting outfit, shrinks back]'' I don't know what that was all about, but I'm glad it's over.}}
