{{L|SpongeBob|Jellyfishing Safety Tips. Rule number one: never try to feed the jellyfish while jellyfishing.}}
{{L|Patrick|You want some? ''[bites and stings Patrick and he screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Rule number two: never, ever try to capture a baby jellyfish.}}
{{L|Patrick|Aww, but they're so cute. ''[a big jellyfish taps Patrick on the shoulder]'' Oh, hey there, mama jellyfish. ''[mama jellyfish stings Patrick and he screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Patrick starts yelling in background as he gets stung by mama jellyfish]'' Which leads us to our final rule, always carry a thick tube of emergency Jellyfish Sting Ointment.}}
{{L|Patrick|I think I might need that. ''[gets stung again and screams]''}}
