{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[The episode starts with the camera panning in on Squidward's house. Squidward arranges living room for a dinner while scatting, the oven dings and his cookies are done. Squidward smells the aroma of the freshly-baked cookies. He then goes into his living room and sets the pan of four, neatly organized, pieces of pointed toast on his coffee table then removes his oven mitts. A few clams grab his apron and carry it away. Then, the door bell rings.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Huh? ''[growls angrily]''}}
{{L|''[Squidward opens the door and sees no one.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey.}}
{{L|''[camera pans down showing SpongeBob standing at the door, smiling.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whatcha doing?}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm busy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How busy would you say you are on a scale of eight to nine?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[angry]'' Fourteen!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, I'm no mathematologist, but that sounds like a lot.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[gets in SpongeBob's face]'' It is!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob's face pops back in place.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, quick survey. Are you busy busy, or just busy?}}
{{L|Squidward|What's "busy busy?"}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob opens his mouth to speak, but Squidward shuts his mouth with his hand.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|No, no, no, no, no! Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Don't tell me anything, don't even tell me what you're doing here!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[in a singing tone]'' I found a jump rope.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[angry]'' I said not to tell me! ''[calmly]'' You're ruining my perfect afternoon. I'm spending some quality time with someone who's very important to me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh! Who's the lu-}}
{{L|''[Squidward slams the door in SpongeBob's face.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sighs; spreads butter on toast]'' Perfectly brown toast points. ''[pours kelp juice in glass]'' Sparkling kelp juice. ''[raises glass and looks in his reflection]'' Here's to me! ''[doorbell rings]'' D'oh! That simpering buffoon!}}
{{L|Squidward's reflection in glass|You have a great vocabulary.}}
{{L|Squidward|I know.}}
{{L|Squidward's reflection|Indubitably.}}
{{L|''[Squidward puts down glass, slams door open, Norton the mailfish is there.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[angry yelling]'' Go away!}}
{{L|''[Norton starts crying.]''}}
{{L|Norton|Okay. ''[starts walking away]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Wait. I thought you were some other idiot.}}
{{L|Norton|No. I guess I'm just this idiot.}}
{{L|''[Norton hands Squidward an envelope. Norton excitedly waits for Squidward to open it. He doesn't open it for about 10 seconds at first, but then opens it. A pop-up picture of Bikini Bottom opens out of a card that Squidward opens again.]''}}
{{L|Norton|Why, it's beautiful.}}
{{L|''[Squidward slams card closed and reads the front.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|"You are cordially invited to the fanciest and shmansiest artistic event of the season: The opening of Galleria Diphtheria." Oh, I've heard of that! "Bikini Bottom's most exclusive fine arts showcase. This invitation guarantees the admittance of Squidward Tentacles--" ''[holds up card and squints eyes]'' "--Squidward Tentacles..." ''[misreads phrase on card]'' "...'Ploos Oh-nay.'"}}
{{L|''[Norton appears behinds Squidward.]''}}
{{L|Norton|Ah, it's a plus one.}}
{{L|Squidward|Ahh! What are you still doing here?}}
{{L|Norton|It's not "ploos oh-nay." It says "plus one"! ''[points to words on cards]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Plus one! Oh, yeah, of course! Plus one! ''[starts laughing a little]'' Sure! ''[looks at invitation]'' What's a plus one?}}
{{L|Norton|Well, when you get an invitation to a party, sometimes, they put "plus one" on it to tell you it's okay to bring along a friend.}}
{{L|Squidward|Do you have to do it?}}
{{L|Norton|Well, no, you could go alone. It's just that everyone will laugh at you 'cause they think you're a friendless loser.}}
{{L|Squidward|What? Do you want me to call your supervisor and tell him you're just standing around?}}
{{L|''[Norton sadly walks out of Squidward's house. Squidward opens the pop-up picture again.]''}}
{{L|Squidward's reflection|You need to find a friend to take as your "plus one".}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[offscreen]'' Somebody like me?}}
{{L|''[Squidward freaks out.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I like openings.}}
{{L|Squidward|No, not like you!}}
{{L|''[Squidward slams the door on SpongeBob. SpongeBob's face pops back in place again and takes out his jump rope.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[disappointed]'' Come on, jump rope. I guess it's just you and me.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob puts one end of the jump rope inside his ear then sadly walks away. Squidward quickly removes his relaxing stuff and takes out a phone book.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Let's see here. Friends... ''[coughs and then blows away the dust, then sighs]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[while looking through the phone book]'' Friends, friends...}}
{{L|''[Squidward keeps flipping the pages until he spots the number, "555-5717". Squidward gets surprised until it is revealed that the number was formed by little bugs.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Hm. Yeah, I wonder if I still have my receipt for this thing. No big deal. Anybody can make a friend by... ''[reveals more of the card that says...]'' ...tonight?! ''[walks around and thinks a bit]'' Let's see. There must be someone who's a real part of your life, Squidward. Who do you see every single day? Who do you know like the back of your suction cups?}}
{{L|''[Squidward sees SpongeBob out the window, laughing and playing with his jump rope.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|But, of course! It's so simple.}}
{{L|''[Squidward runs out of the house. SpongeBob falls on his jump rope. Squidward runs up to SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, I have something to ask you.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob happily blinks his eyes to the camera and grabs Squidward's arm.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Of course I'll go to the opening with you!}}
{{L|Squidward|That wasn't the question. Which way did the mailman go?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, he said he had a package for the Widow Duncan. I think he went...}}
{{L|''[Squidward quickly runs off. SpongeBob sadly walks away. Norton is delivering a package at the Widow Duncan's door and is having her sign some papers.]''}}
{{L|Norton|And then you just initial there, and we're all set.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey, there you are!}}
{{L|''[Squidward runs up to Norton, but Norton becomes scared as he thinks Squidward is going to hurt him.]''}}
{{L|Norton|Not in the face!}}
{{L|Squidward|What? What are you... Oh! ''[laughs]'' You always were a big kidder, huh? ''[laughs a bit]'' Mailman ''[thinks a second]'' guy?}}
{{L|Norton|Actually, I'm not a kidder. I'm much more of an introvert.}}
{{L|Squidward|I love introverts! Why, I'm an introvert!}}
{{L|''[Squidward stands on Norton's head and the crowd cheers.]''}}
{{L|Norton|You are?}}
{{L|''[Squidward jumps down.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Say, I bet we have a lot in common.}}
{{L|Norton|''[laughs nervously]'' Yeah, I don't know. I'm just a regular guy. But in not being a mailman, I love going to fancy art galleries.}}
{{L|Squidward|That's me!}}
{{L|Norton|And eating delicious food.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, delicious food is my favorite kind of food! Especially when that delicious food is something you can...}}
{{L|Both|Spread on a toast point!}}
{{L|''[They both laugh and hug each other until they calm down.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Once you've had pointed toast, you just never want any other kind.}}
{{L|Norton|Right? And if there's one thing I hate, it's...}}
{{L|Squidward|''[simultaneously]'' SpongeBob!}}
{{L|Norton|''[simultaneously]'' Clarinets!}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah, I know it... What?}}
{{L|Norton|I mean, what kind of maniac could enjoy the sound of a clarinet? That squeaky, hollow, kind of piercing howl from the very pits of Gehenna. Only a deluded blow-hard with nothing to lose could pick up a ''[grunts]'' clarinet and think "Yeah! This is for me! Let me inflict this pain on the world!" ''[laughs]'' Am I right, buddy? Heh. Uh.}}
{{L|''[Squidward is nowhere to be seen.]''}}
{{L|Norton|Buddy? ''[slaps his face]'' Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why are you so darn opinionated, Norton? All you do with your searing and abnormal honesty is drive everyone away! When's Norton's time? When's Norton's time to shine?!}}
{{L|Widow Duncan|Oh, Norton! I've always taken a shine to you. ''[winks as her dentures slide out]''}}
{{L|''[Norton nervously slides the dentures back in Widow Duncan's mouth and runs away. The scene changes to Squidward walking down a street in Bikini Bottom until he sees a can tied to a string.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, you think you know a guy? ''[kicks can]'' Oh, who are you kidding? It's not in the cards for you. I bet not even this old tin can would be my friend.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[talks through can]'' I'll be your friend.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[grumbles as he picks up the can]'' Who is this?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's me, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|''[Squidward looks at the can and reads the label, "Protein Powder" on it. The label on the can gives him an idea.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes? I'm still here.}}
{{L|Squidward|I need to ask you something important.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob blinks his eyes in excitement.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You don't have to ask me three times.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob rips his pants and reveals a tuxedo underneath.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Will you tell Larry I want to talk to him?}}
{{L|''[Squidward runs off and drops the can.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[disappointed again]'' Oh.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob picks up the can and sadly starts to play jump rope.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okey-doke.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to several of Larry's friends working out. Squidward is seen standing next to Larry as he is talking to him.]''}}
{{L|Larry|So, Squidward, what do you wanna talk about?}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, it's, uh, kind of hard to put into words.}}
{{L|Larry|Oh, I've been there, amigo.}}
{{L|Squidward|You have?}}
{{L|Larry|Sure. But nothing clears the sawdust out of your brains quicker than a ride on a jet ski.}}
{{L|''[Larry holds out a jet ski.]''}}
{{L|Larry|Ever been on one of these little babies?}}
{{L|Squidward|Um, no. The.. they always seemed a little sporty for me.}}
{{L|Larry|Well, you only live once. And I just happen to have an extra helmet.}}
{{L|''[Larry holds out a helmet for Squidward.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What the heck?}}
{{L|''[Squidward puts on the helmet and rides with Larry across the water. As they ride, they draw images of Squidward and Larry in the water. Then the fly off a ramp and ride across the beach. The ride through some people standing in line at a ride in the amusement park.]''}}
{{L|Unnamed fish|Hey!}}
{{L|''[Larry and Squidward ride on the rails of a roller coaster with the jet ski. Squidward is then playing a game of pool with Larry. Then Squidward and Larry are watching a movie and eating popcorn with the jet ski. Squidward and Larry are now at a wig store playing music with the bongos and the clarinet while the jet ski is holding a saxophone. A man passes by and donates money to them.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|We make quite a team!}}
{{L|Larry|I'll say!}}
{{L|Squidward|You know, earlier today, I met a jerk who said he didn't like clarinet music.}}
{{L|Larry|Hey, you know, that's very uncool. What kind of thoughtless ding-dong would knock another man's passion?}}
{{L|Squidward|You know, you're alright, Lester.}}
{{L|Larry|It's Larry.}}
{{L|Squidward|Whatever. The point is, do you want to go with me to a gallery opening tonight?}}
{{L|Larry|Well, that's not my kind of thing at all, but... for you, sure. I'll just need to stop by the apartment and make myself a protein shake.}}
{{L|Squidward|What?! You don't need that glop!}}
{{L|Larry|Oh, I wouldn't call it "glop". Protein shake saved my life, bro.}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, come on. It's a fad. You don't wanna be one of those mindless rubes who marches around in a constant haze of stupidity. "I love protein shakes. I'm the most gullible rube on the planet. Duh! Duh! Duh! Give me my stupid protein shake."}}
{{L|''[Squidward bumps into Larry while he continues to mock. He looks up and sees Larry in extreme anger after the way he made fun of him.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[dumbfounded]'' I mean...}}
{{L|''[Larry punches Squidward to the ground and walks off. Squidward pops his head out.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|So, are we still on for tonight? Sevenish?}}
{{L|''[Squidward looks at his reflection on the window.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sighs]'' I guess it's just you and me again.}}
{{L|''[Squidward turns and sees SpongeBob breathing heavily.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[scoffs]'' What are you doing here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[holds out his jump rope]'' Just playing draggy rope. You wanna play?}}
{{L|Squidward|No.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You hold on to one end of the rope and you drag it behind you like a sea snake is chasing you, like this. Wanna play?}}
{{L|Squidward|Just get me out of here!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[silence]'' Will do.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob pulls Squidward out of the hole with the jump rope, but ends up making him fall flat on his face.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Thanks.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Anything for a friend.}}
{{L|''[Squidward comes up with an idea.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Friend?}}
{{L|''[Squidward sees his reflection in SpongeBob's eyes and grins.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Would you be my plus one?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob gasps in excitement. The scene changes to people attending the Galleria Diptheria. A limousine drives up and Squidward, who is now wearing a tuxedo, steps out.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Come on, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob, dressed in a black suit, comes out of the limousine with a mirror that shows Squidward's reflection and closes the door. Squidward and SpongeBob walk across the red rug with the mirror.]''}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|And here comes Squidward Tentacles and what must be either a bizarre piece of performance art or the saddest display of loneliness it has ever been my displeasure to report. One is inclined to suspect the second thing I said. A thing about sadness!}}
{{L|''[Squidward and SpongeBob stop in the middle.]''}}
{{L|Squidward's reflection|You'll always be my plus one!}}
{{L|Squidward|Aww!}}
{{L|''[The episode ends with people taking random pictures of Squidward, SpongeBob and the mirror with Squidward's reflection on it.]''}}
