{{L|Fred|Stay away from '''my leg''' '''(29)''' (23), SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Fred, I'm so sorry I drove that freight train onto '''your leg!''' '''(30)'''}}
{{L|''[The scene changes into a flashback. Fred is stretching his leg out onto the railroad while sipping down a drink. Suddenly, SpongeBob comes rolling by the tracks on a small freight train laughing, running over Fred's leg.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[chuckles]'' Choo-choo.}}
{{L|Fred|'''My leg!''' '''(31)''' (24)}}
{{L|''[An ambulance drives by. The paramedics pick up Fred and drive him away to the hospital. The flashback ends and SpongeBob squiggles his body.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs]'' Flashbacks tickle.}}
{{L|''[Fred ties a balloon around SpongeBob.]''}}
{{L|Fred|Now please go away. ''[blows SpongeBob away and leaves]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, I know. I'll protect '''his leg!''' '''(32)''' From harm, incognito.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob pulls on the string, pops the balloon and flies into a nearby trashcan. He sees Fred is going to step in the oil puddle. He jumps out and falls flat onto the oil puddle so Fred wouldn't slip on it.]''}}

{{L|SpongeBob|''[rips himself in half]'' This is his job?! Oh no. Not safe. Must think. ''[puts on a fake mustache and construction helmet; talks in a deep voice]'' Welcome back, Fred. '''Nice leg''' '''(34)''' work. But you know, it's a lot safer if you use a...''[pulls out a table leg]'' '''table leg''' '''(35)''' instead.}}
{{L|Fred|Wow! Really?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[chuckles]'' Now Fred, I wouldn't pull '''your leg!''' '''(36)''' Watch this. ''[pushes the log in the drilling machine, but ends up getting caught in the blades]'' Huh?}}
{{L|''[With SpongeBob jamming the machine, it starts to overload and the construction workers flee the factory. The factory unleashes a devastating explosion. The smoke clears and SpongeBob pops out from the debris.]''}}

{{L|Patrick|''[wearing a gas mask]'' So far this plan stinks.}}

{{L|Dr. Charley Horse|The only way to relax '''your leg!''' '''(40)''' Is to walk on... ''[removes the rug and reveals a patch of burning, hot coals underneath]'' hot coals.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Hot coals?!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob goes to protect Fred while Patrick hides in a sock.]''}}
{{L|Dr. Charley Horse|Now Fred, close your eyes, and repeat after me the ancient mantra: '''My feet''' '''(41)''' are cold. '''My feet''' '''(42)''' are cold.}}
{{L|Fred and Dr. Charley Horse|'''My feet''' '''(43)''' are cold.}}

{{L|Patrick|''[grabs the box of cookies]'' I got the weapon! ''[the girl scout bites his leg]'' Yow!}}
{{L|''[The girl scout brutally beats Patrick up and whacks him around on the ground while holding his leg with her teeth. She heavily pants like a wild savage beast until picks up the box and returns to her sweet innocent self. She skips away and Fred removes SpongeBob's sunglasses.]''}}
{{L|Fred|SpongeBob? Why are you following '''my leg?!''' '''(54)''' (27) (42) [pulls SpongeBob off his leg]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Fred, you have to listen to me. '''Your leg!''' '''(55)''' (43) Is in constant danger. Isn't that so, Patrick?}}

{{L|Fred|I know. I just miss being at the hospital.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why?}}
{{L|Fred|Well, secretly...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh! ''[leans closer to listen]''}}
{{L|Fred|''[whispers]'' I'm in love with a nurse.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, you're in love with a nurse? Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! ''[forms into a heart and sighs; a cupid arrow pops SpongeBob back to his normal form]'' Fred, I've got an idea. Why don't we hurt '''your leg!''' '''(59)''' (47) So you can be reunited with your lady fair?}}
{{L|Fred|Let's do it! And we should step on it. It's almost time for her break.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'd say it's almost time for ''your'' break.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Fred share a laugh. SpongeBob takes out a toy hammer and hits Fred's leg with it, but it didn't do any physical harm.]''}}

{{L|''[Fred stretches out his leg and SpongeBob quietly explains to the convict to hit it with his hammer.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ahh?}}
{{L|Convict|Hmm? Mm-mm.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob grabs the hammer and goes to hit Fred's leg with it. But the hammer slips off his hand and it lands on the convict's foot. The screen becomes black and white and like a silent movie, the convict words '''"My Leg!"''' '''(60)''' (30) (48) appears on the screen when he screams. The ambulance arrives again.

{{L|''[The ambulance arrives again. The paramedics climb out, throw Tom in, and float away.]''}}
{{L|Fred|Aw, it's no use, SpongeBob. Maybe the nurse and me were never meant to be.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now, don't put your tail between '''your legs!''' '''(69)''' (57) Just yet, Fred. I've got the perfect plan to get you back to the hospital. Okay, here's what we do... ''[his left leg grows back, but it's smaller than his normal leg]'' Hey, '''my leg!''' '''(70)''' (34) (58)}}
{{L|''[The ambulance falls back down, crashing on top of Fred. The paramedics climb out, throw SpongeBob on the side, and drive away, leaving Fred with some tire marks.]''}}

{{L|Fred|‚ô™When I met you, my fingers went numb and my arms were all aloof. But I tripped over your heart. And now, my loneliness went poof. Because... '''My leg''' '''(74)''' (36) (61) is in love!
