{{L|''[SpongeBob & Patrick are running through Jellyfish Fields laughing and trying to capture jellyfish.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[pokes SpongeBob]'' You're it! ''[both laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pokes Patrick]'' You're it! ''[both laugh. Patrick runs off]'' Wait, Pat, ''you're'' it! ''[notices a sign a few yards away and yelps. Patrick laughs, not paying attention]'' The sign!}}
{{L|Patrick|Huh? ''[tries to read it as he is running]'' Duuhh... aaann... ger... ''[crashes through the sign and falls off the cliff]'' cliff!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick! ''[runs down the cliff to Patrick]'' Let me help you out of there, buddy! ''[grabs a starfish shaped head out of the ground. When he notices it's just a head, he screams]'' Is the rest of you down there?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[walks up to SpongeBob with no head attached to his body]'' The rest of me is up here.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whew, you had me worried there, buddy. ''[laughs]'' Here's your head. ''[attaches the head onto Patrick and laughs. Picture of inside Patrick's head shows a plug plugging into an outlet. Gears and cranks start up. Patrick gets a spark or two from his head]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'! ''[takes out two jellyfish nets. Hands a net to Patrick]'' Go ahead, you get first crack.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[jellyfish floats by]'' Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.}}
{{L|Patrick|Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets! C'mon, Patrick! ''[captures a jellyfish]'' Look, buddy, I captured one!}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes... ''[shows SpongeBob a notebook with a Davinci-style jellyfish drawn]'' I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner. ''[frees the jellyfish from SpongeBob's net]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay...what do you wanna do?}}
{{L|Patrick|Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Pretty.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes, quite.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Fragile.}}
{{L|Patrick|Indeed.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[jumps at Patrick three times]'' C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I was thinking more like jumping rope, ''[jumps rope with his arms]'' 1-legged races ''[one leg goes inside his body and he hops on his remaining leg]'', or playing duck-duck-hermit crab. ''[jumps into a hermit-crab shell and blows bubbles]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Doesn't feel like fun.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pops out of the shell]'' How about some jokes? ''[Patrick sighs]'' Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?}}
{{L|Patrick|You can't ''strum'' a jellyfish.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes! ''[laughs. Patrick grabs a jellyfish and strums its tentacles]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh my, look at the time. I really must be going. ''[walks off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's wrong with Patrick? I sure hope he gets better soon. ''[at Patrick's house where Patrick is doing some scientific work]'' Are you better, Pat? Uhh, whatcha doing?}}
{{L|Patrick|Just studying this amazing subspecies.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[through a microscope]'' I'll show you subspecies!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wanna visit Squidward?}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, since I am finished with my work, I'll humor you with your trivial pursuits. ''[now at Squidward's house where Squidward is playing his clarinet. He hears SpongeBob and Patrick come in and prepares to yell at them]'' I'd recognize that piece anywhere! Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67, "Symphony in Blue."}}
{{L|Squidward|''[very confused]'' Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|It's a beautiful piece. Execution needs some work. ''[walks over to the piano]'' May I suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale.}}
{{L|Squidward|Wow! I never thought to do it like that.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, that is because you rarely think.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How do you know so much about music?}}
{{L|Patrick|A creative outlet provides a spiritual release and helps facilitate a healthy mental balance. ''[inhales]'' Ah.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Does that include... ''[burps]'' belch-talk-ing?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[waving his hand in front of his face]'' Mr. SquarePants, I find your humor ''vulgar.''}}
{{L|Squidward|I had no idea you were so knowledgeable, Patrick! Do you think you can be my musical mentor?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uhh, guys?}}
{{L|Patrick|Let's take it from the top. ''[Squidward plays, badly]'' Not so excellent, Squidward. Let me demonstrate the proper technique. ''[looks at clarinet with spit covered all over the mouth piece]'' On second thought, practice makes perfect. Let's begin. ''[SpongeBob comes up playing his musical nose as a flute]'' Thank you, my good chap. Unfortunately, this is a solo piece for clarinet only. And 1, 2, 3, 4... ''[Squidward plays more. SpongeBob frowns and walks out. Patrick covers his ears since Squidward's playing is still terrible]'' Stop! Enough! ''[walks out]'' Find yourself a new mentor!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub.}}
{{L|Patrick|No, SpongeBob, I'm afraid not.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap! ''[blows a bubble that pops on Patrick's face]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[wiping his face]'' No, thanks again.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, maybe later we can play pirates.}}
{{L|Patrick|Robert, my dear, it's no use. We've just grown apart.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What? What do you mean?}}
{{L|Patrick|I know we've had fun in the past, but we're just not compatible anymore. It's time we went our separate ways...such is life.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[starting to cry]'' But Patrick, you're my best friend!}}
{{L|Patrick|I know it's hard, but brace up, chap.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah.}}
{{L|Patrick|Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Think fondly of me, Mr. SquarePants.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Goodbye... Mr... Best friend! ''[sobs. At Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob rings her doorbell]'' Sandy, you there? I need some professional help. ''[Sandy and Patrick are heard laughing inside]'' Patrick?}}
{{L|Sandy|Well, Pat, the new you gets an A+.}}
{{L|Patrick|Why, thank you, Sandra. I find your intellect rather stimulating as well.}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh, really? Well, thanks. ''[SpongeBob cries then walks away from the treedome, at a chalkboard, there's an equation on it]'' Well, Patrick, what do you think about this problem?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[changes formula]'' You simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desired quotient. Even the simplest of mammals can figure it out with a little thought.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[angrily puts her hands on her hips]'' What do you mean by that, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm merely suggesting you lack the ability to solve remedial equations.}}
{{L|Sandy|Are you suggesting I'm ''dumb?''}}
{{L|Patrick|I'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired'.}}
{{L|Sandy|I think you'd better leave.}}
{{L|Patrick|I was only trying to help. ''[walks off]''}}
{{L|Sandy|I don't need your kind of help, Mr. know-it-all! I liked you better when you were a barnacle head!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sitting on his chair at home, crying]'' I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[sitting on his chair at home]'' Surrounded by knowledge and no one to share it with. No one I can call friend. Who's that old chap I used to run with? ''[notices a book on the table next to him called 'MY FRIEND SPONGEBOB']'' SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks at his 'MY FRIEND PATRICK' book]'' Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories. ''[SpongeBob looks at several pictures of him and Patrick together, as SpongeBob begins to cry another picture is shown, it's revealed that Patrick is the one who put a tear on the last picture]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Aww, the glory days. Why have we grown apart? I must apply all that I know to solve this problem! ''[looks at x-rays of him and SpongeBob's head, meditates on top of his rock, studies Squidward, reads a book. He puts the book down and shows his bloodshot eyes]'' What could it be? ''[applies a chemical on his head and grows hair]'' What's different? Ah! ''[tears out his hair]'' What?! I'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[doorbell rings]'' Coming... ''[opens door and gets kidnapped in a jellyfish net. Patrick is shown carrying the net over his shoulder with SpongeBob inside. SpongeBob pops out happily]'' Patrick, you're kidnapping me?}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes, I am.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yay! ''[jumps out of the net and writes "Yippie" in the air with bubble soap]'' What should we do?}}
{{L|Patrick|We are going to have fun, whatever the cost may be.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's do this.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes, let's have some fun.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[jumping around]'' Oh, yeah!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[jumping around]'' Oh, absolutely! ''[now riding on a shell down a mountain]'' Are you quite sure I found this activity to be ''fun?''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah! ''[screams with enjoyment. Shell lunges them into the sand]'' That was fun, huh Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Swallows a mouth-full of sand]'' When did the fun go away, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off.}}
{{L|Patrick|That's it! ''[runs off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's what? Patrick, what are you doing?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm going to duplicate my actions from that day to ascertain the origin of my cha...an...nge! ''[falls off the cliff]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick! Hold on, buddy! ''[takes Patrick out of the ground]'' There ya go. ''[notices he has no head and screams]'' Don't worry, Patrick. I found your head last time, I'll find it again! ''[searches around some coral]'' Not back there. ''[checks under a rock]'' Not under here. What if I can't find it? Oh, poor headless Patrick! ''[turns around and runs into Patrick making his head pop out]'' Patrick, your head is back! But, uhh, do you feel different?}}
{{L|Patrick|Quite unchanged, actually.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I guess we'll never have fun together again.}}
{{L|Patrick|You said you found my dislodged cranial cap last time.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes.}}
{{L|Patrick|Where exactly did you find it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uhh, it was right here.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hmmm, impossible! If I landed ''here,'' the trajectory of my dismembered skull would cause it to come to rest, not ''there,'' but ''here,'' exactly five meters due north.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over... ''[sign says 'Brain Coral Field']'' Brain Coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy. ''[blows off the Poison Sea Urchins off Patrick's head]'' Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and "phosisticated" to be my friend again?}}
{{L|Patrick|Knowledge can never replace friendship. I prefer to be an idiot!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal. ''[Patrick takes off his coral head and SpongeBob puts his old one back on]'' Patrick? Say something, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[burps]'' Hi, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, you're back!}}
{{L|Patrick|Patrick, you're back. ''[both laugh, then pull out their jellyfish nets, make oo-loo-loo sounds, and run off into the sunset]''}}
