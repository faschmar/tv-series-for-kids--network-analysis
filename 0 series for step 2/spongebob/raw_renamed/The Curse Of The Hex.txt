{{L|''[It's a dark and stormy night at the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Nat|Boy, good thing I remembered my umbrella.}}
{{L|Mabel|Me too.}}
{{L|''[Nat and the old fish both walk out of the Krusty Krab and gets swept away by a tornado]''}}
{{L|Abigail Marge|Come on, kids. ''[The family of fish also get swept away]''}}
{{L|Dave|''[walks outside]'' Ahh, too bad I forgot my umbrella. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ahhh, the end of another successful business day. You know, Squidward, this kind of day always reminds me of money. ''[pours the money out of his cash register]'' Ahhahhahah.... ''[Pilar gets swept away]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, yeah, that's nice. I'll be here working while you.....AHHHHHHHH! ''[sees an old fish at the door]'' Uh... Uh... Um... I'm sorry, ma’am, ''[gulps]'' but were closed. ''[The hagfish pours saliva out of her mouth]'' I know you're hungry, but- ''[The Hagfish pours out more saliva]''. Uh... but we really are closed. Thank you, come again.}}
{{L|''[Madame Hagfish slides through the door as Squidward closes it]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey! Closed means closed, Grandma! ''[closes the door and the fish is pulled back, the fish slides into the Krusty Krab and sighs]'' Oh, boy, Some people... ''[walks to the cash register]''}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|''[goes to order]'' One Krabby Patty, please.}}
{{L|Squidward|I told you...we're closed! I was supposed to get out of here ten minutes ago! And besides, I already cashed the register out.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Oh, but I-}}
{{L|Squidward|No.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|I-}}
{{L|Squidward|No.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|I-}}
{{L|Squidward|No way.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Please I-}}
{{L|Squidward|Never...}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|I brought exact change... ''[holds out three small shells]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[eyes twirking]'' Ah-ha, that is what they cost...20 years ago. Krabby Patties cost $4.50, lady.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Oh, dear. Seems I'm just one short.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[looks at her]'' No way, granny!}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Oh, But it's all I have. Please...}}
{{L|Squidward|Nope.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Oh ''please''.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sniffles]'' How terribly sad.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Please, Oh, please...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[whispers to the Hagfish]''}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|''[gasps. slithers to the door]'' You haven't seen the last of me! ''[leaves]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, I've certainly seen enough. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What a creepy old hagfish, I thought she'd never leave.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Aye, good job there, SpongeBob. Say, what did you tell here that finally drove her out? I may need to know in case she ever comes back. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[begins laughing along]'' Need to know in case she ever- ''[laughs again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[leaves]'' Have a good night, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, you too, SpongeBob. Have a good- ''[notices something in SpongeBob's pants]''...night?}}
{{L|''[Thick fog sweeps across the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sneaks behind the Krusty Krab]'' Old lady? Old lady?}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Here I am. ''[coughs]'' Right where you told me to meet you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Actually, I told you to meet me two paces to the left.}}
{{L|''[Hagfish moves two paces to the left]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh good, you're here! ''[pulls two delicious Krabby Patties out of his pants]'' I brought the stuff.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|My goodness! This has to be the most kind, most generous, most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're welcome, just take them before someone sees us.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Too late! ''[takes the patties]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So, it's true!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|H-How did you find out?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Found out? Boy, you would have to get up pretty early to sneak a pair of buns past old, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Squidward|Or before he takes off his sleep mask.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|How did you know I wear a sleep mask?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ohh please, Mr. Krabs don't fire me. Please! ''[thunder]''}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|''[flies in the air]'' Eye of newt and frozen sharkskin slab, I hereby curse the Krusty Krab! ''[evil laugh. flies away. The clouds clear up]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[throws patties away]'' We are not a soup kitchen, boy! And these will be coming out of your paycheck. Besides, we don't want to encourage- ''[shutters]'' charity...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But what about the- the- the- the- the- the-}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Come on, boy! Spit it out!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The- the- the- the- the-}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Okay, let's see what's under the hood. ''[reveals a record player in SpongeBob's chest and moves the pin and laughs]'' I think that should do it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What about the curse?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Curse? Boy, let me explain something about curses with a short story me grandpappy used to tell me: Oh yes, curses are nonsense!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|They are, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yep. Just fabricated superstition. Right, Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|You're asking the wrong guy about curses, I live next to SpongeBob. ''[shudders]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' See, boy, just a bonical ramblings of an old lady. Nothing to worry about.}}
{{L|''[Cuts to inside the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs watching out the door]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Squidward, I'm starting to get worried. I've got a funny feeling that the Krusty Krab really is cursed.}}
{{L|Squidward|And why is that?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, we haven't seen a single customer all morning!}}
{{L|Squidward|That's not a curse. ''[sips coffee]'' That's a blessing.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' Yeah, you're right, there is no such thing as curses. Ha.}}
{{L|''[A dish suddenly falls from the top of the Krusty Krab, it startles Squidward, who drops his coffee, starting a fire, the fire begins burning Mr. Krabs' money]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Me money! Aah!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I got it! I got it! ''[grabs a dollar bill and begins blowing on it]'' Oh, Oh Hot, hot! ''[realizes that it is hot and slowly rips it into pieces]'' I don't got it...}}
{{L|Squidward|I just remember there is a no-curse clause in my contract, nice working with you.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Squidward, wait. You don't even have a contract.}}
{{L|Squidward|There is a no-contract clause in it too.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are driving to Madam Hagfish's house]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, what makes you so sure that even if we find that old lady, that she will lift the curse?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughs]'' Don't worry, SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs has a special technique when dealing with situations like these. It's called beggin' and pleadin.'}}
{{L|French Narrator|Many hours later...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, SpongeBob,  I don't think were ever gonna find-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, look!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well I'll be the slimy, son of a slithery, slippery sea slug, boy. It's here!}}
{{L|''[At Madame Hagfish's house]''}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Give me one good reason why I should lift the curse.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Because if ya' don't, me business will be ruined forever.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|I said: give me a good reason.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[crying and on his knees, begging]'' Oh please, Madame Hagfish. Please, I'll do anything, anything at all.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Oh, I like a man who begs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[whispering to SpongeBob]'' See, told ya.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|I will lift the curse, provided you two complete a dangerous task.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, wait a minute, granny, what part of this-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh anything, Great Hagfish.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Bring me the sacred gold doubloon from the throat of the Giant Golden Eel!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs|Okay...}}
{{L|''[Cuts a dark cave]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, this must be it. The lair of the Golden Eel.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|How could you tell?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|She gave me its business card.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs begin walking through the cave]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey, SpongeBob so you think this fudgy stuff we're walking in is the eel's-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|...Leftover pudding. Yes I thought that too.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hold it, SpongeBob, Look. ''[points to the Golden Eel, who is sleeping]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's the eel. Well, nappy time always comes after pudding. Let's go get the doubloon from his throat before he wakes up.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Good idea, be careful not to-}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[trips and falls]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|''[The Golden Eels starts to awaken]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|He's awake!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob screams. The Golden Eel begins to mumble and swings his tail around]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Look out for his- Tail! Quick find something to-}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs uses SpongeBob as a shield]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|...Hide behind... ''[the eel whacks SpongeBob and he goes flying]'' Whoa!}}
{{L|''[The Golden Eel grabs and strangles Mr. Krabs with his tail]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[starting to get up]'' Morning, already. ''[gasps]'' I'm coming Mr. Krabs ''[runs to Mr. Krabs]'' Don't go anywhere!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I really don't have a choice. ''[the eel traps in on Mr. Krabs tighter]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Take this! ''[pokes the Eel with his fist very lightly. The eel drops Mr. Krabs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Good job, laddie!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're not finished yet! ''[pokes the Eel again, the doubloon flies out of his mouth]'' I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it! ''[claps his hands together but is unsuccessful in catching it]'' I don't got it.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs shows that he has caught it. Cuts back to Madame Hagfish's house]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Madame Hagfish, we've got the gold doubloon you asked for.}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|Finally. ''[deposits the doubloon into her washing machine]'' Clean free.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ahh, now it's time to lift that curse, like you promised.}}
{{L|''[Cuts to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|''[pulls out a 'closed' sign from the Krusty Krab lawn]'' There ya' go, the curse is lifted.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A closed sign?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That's it? That's the curse?!}}
{{L|Madame Hagfish|You think I'm gonna waste good spells on a bottom-feeder like you? Have a nice day.}}
{{L|''[many customers immediately drive up]''}}
{{L|''[now inside the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs| Well, it's like I told you before boy, there ain't no such thing as witches, or curses, or magical beings, or-}}
{{L|''[a very loud rumbling is heard. the Giant Golden Eel pops up inside the Krusty Krab, which scares everyone away as the episode ends]''}}
