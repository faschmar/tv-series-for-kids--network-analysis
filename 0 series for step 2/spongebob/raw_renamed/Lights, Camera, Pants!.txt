==Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy special==

=== Intro ===
{{L|TV announcer|''The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy''! Mermaid Man! Forceful, fearless, regular. Aided by his trusted ward, Barnacle Boy!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|''[grabs Barnacle Boy and shakes him]'' Most important meal of the day.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Oh, put me down, you old coot!}}
{{L|TV announcer|Protecting our seas and homes from our most dastardly of villains, including their number #1 arch nemesis, the Dirty Bubble.}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|''[chasing and scaring a couple of citizens]'' A booga-booga-booga! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|TV announcer|And their second most arch nemesis, Man Ray.}}
{{L|Man Ray|''[after making graffiti on a building]'' Oh, come on! What does it take to get to number #1 in this town?}}
{{L|TV announcer|Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! Well, they're better than nothing.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|By the power of Neptune, unite! ''[he and Barnacle Boy join their rings together]''}}

=== At the Sand Stadium ===
{{L|TV announcer|The Sand Stadium, cultural hub of our undersea art community. Home of quality music from Bikini Bottom's finest performers. And also ''[referring to the whale performers]'' these guys. It's good to know if there's any trouble, the audience is safe tonight. For amongst them are Bikini Bottom's finest crime fighters. And also ''[referring to Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy]'' these guys.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Barnacle Boy? ''[shakes Barnacle Boy]'' Barnacle Boy?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Oh, what is it now? I'm trying to watch.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Who's winning?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|What are you— ''[stutters]'' Oh, look. I told you. It's a musical performance, not a football game.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|''[stupidly]'' Ah, you're only saying that because your team's losing.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|''[groans]'' No! I—oh, geez.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|''[waves pennant]'' Who's court?}}

{{L|Maestro|
**'''SpongeBob''': My big moment as a maestro! ''[bends his baton]'' Stay cool, SpongeBob. They're all watching you. ''[accidentally flicks his baton, sending it flying into the audience and hitting someone]'' '''Man''': Ow! '''SpongeBob''': Nah! Uh, here's the Whale Pants! One, two, three, four!
**'''Patrick''': Huh? Who are you? A-and what are you doing in my bathroom? '''Whale performer''': Ahem! '''Patrick''': Oh, right, uh. The choir. Okay, on this tune, I'll be performing alongside the delightful sounds of Whale On My Packs. Right now!
**'''Squidward''': My moment has arrived. Under the excellent conductorship of yours truly, Maestro Squidward, I present the Whale Philharmonic! Hit it!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Argh! Welcome aboard all you heavily paying customers! Me and the Whaler Sailors here will play a few shanties for your pleasure! Feel free to throw money! No coin too heavy! ''[laughs]''
**'''Sandy''': Howdy, y'all! Welcome to my hootin' annie! You're in for a treat tonight 'cause me and the fellers are in fine form! I present to you the Texas Blubber Boys!
**'''Plankton''': Behold my awesome power! Tonight, I will unleash my army of killer whales and— '''Whale performer''': Ahem! '''Plankton''': Oh, yeah. ''[clears throat]'' Here's the music of Whaletronic 2000. Activate!}}
{{L|''[The maestro begins his performance and the whales start to sing.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|That quarterback is showing real progress this season.}}
{{L|''[The maestro continues his performance with the whales.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Did you find the hotdogs chewy this evening, Barnacle Boy?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|That wasn't a hotdog, it was the arm of the chair, you old coot.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|''[realizing]'' I thought it was a bit stale and hard to lift. Phew. I probably shouldn't have eaten all that cheesecake either. ''[rubs his belly and fiddles around with his utility belt, pushing one of the buttons that creates a bright flash, blinding the audience in the process]''}}
{{L|''[All of the sudden, the Sand Stadium shakes and completely vanishes into thin air.]''}}

{{L|Maestro|
**'''SpongeBob''': Maybe they're all getting up to dance?
**'''Patrick''': Wow. The crowd's really getting into it tonight.
**'''Squidward''': They're all moved by my amazing performance!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': No! Come back! There ain't no refunds you know!
**'''Sandy''': Hotdog! We really brought the house down!
**'''Plankton''': Hmm. I don't remember activating a Doomsday device today.}}
{{L|''[The dust clears and the audience is scattered everywhere on the ground including Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Oh, what have ya done this time, Mermaid Man?}}
{{L|Lady|Oh, look! It's Mermaid Man! He's gone mad and destroyed the Sand Stadium! Someone call the police! Mermaid Man must've gone EVIL!!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Evil!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Ah, geez! Come on, Mermaid Man! We better get to the bottom of this disappearance before we're arrested. ''[grabs Mermaid Man and drags him]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|I hope the merchandise stand hasn't sold out of those big foam hands. I-I love those things.}}

=== Police Chase ===
{{L|''[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy rush to the invisible boatmobile. Mermaid Man jumps in, but Barnacle Boy falls straight to the ground, hurting his buttocks in the process.]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Ow!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Ooh, sorry, Barnacle Boy. I must be in the passenger seat. ''[hops over to the driver seat]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|''[gets in the passenger seat]'' Remind me again why we made the invisible boatmobile invisible?}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive away.]''}}

{{L|Police Officer|
**'''SpongeBob''': That rock hasn't moved for a while. And that seaweed is swaying a little too quickly. That coral looks awfully—
**'''Patrick''': ''[imitates static noise]'' Breaker, breaker. ''[static]'' What are you talking about? I didn't break anything. ''[static]'' No, I-uh. I was just saying. ''[static]'' You've got a smart mouth! Maybe I should run you in! ''[static]'' But you hate running! ''[static]'' You've got a smart mouth, Mister! Maybe I should—
**'''Squidward''': Join the police force they said. Exciting life of action they said. ''[blows raspberry]'' I say.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': ''[looking through his right claw]'' Clear. All clear. ''[looks through telescope]'' Still clear. Argh, I love double-overtime duty.
**'''Sandy''': ♪Oh, give me a home where the barnacles grow and the—♪
**'''Plankton''': Now that I've infiltrated the police force, I'll control Bikini Bottom from both sides of the law! And—}}
{{L|Chief|''[through walkie-talkie]'' Officer, be on the lookout for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in their invisible boatmobile! They are believed to be old and dangerous.}}

{{L|Police officer|
**'''SpongeBob''': Officer SpongeBob understands over!
**'''Patrick''': Hello?
**'''Squidward''': Thank goodness you called. I am so bored.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': ''[imitates slurping a cup]'' Argh. ''[slurps]''
**'''Sandy''': Copy that, chieferooney!
**'''Plankton''': Oh, what is it now?}}
{{L|Chief|''[through walkie-talkie]'' Officer, have you seen Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive past the police officer.]''}}

{{L|Police officer|
**'''SpongeBob''': Wow. My heroes.
**'''Patrick''': Have I seen what now?
**'''Squidward''': I'm sorry. You were saying?
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Shiver me timbers!
**'''Sandy''': 10-4. We got a 10-12 on that 10-17. I got that 10-20 over.
**'''Plankton''': Maybe.}}
{{L|Chief|''[through walkie-talkie]'' That sounded like the invisible boatmobile! Was that them?}}

{{L|Police officer|
**'''SpongeBob''': Steven! I mean Rodger! I mean—
**'''Patrick''': Who? '''Chief''': ''[through walkie-talkie]'' '''''Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!''''' '''Patrick''': Oh! Yeah, I guess.
**'''Squidward''': Two floating old guys? Uh-huh.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Argh. That it was. That it was.
**'''Sandy''': Didn't I just say that?
**'''Plankton''': Oh, very well. Yes!}}
{{L|Chief|''[through walkie-talkie]'' Apprehend them at once!}}

{{L|Police Officer|
**'''SpongeBob''': I am on it! ''[peddles and talks in the sound of a siren]'' I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!
**'''Patrick''': Copy that. Over and out. ''[imitates static]'' I'm in hot pursuit! ''[static]'' You're not that hot. ''[static]'' You've got a smart mouth! Maybe I— '''Chief''': ''[through walkie-talkie]'' '''''NOW!!!''''' '''Patrick''': Oh, yeah! ''[peddles and imitates siren]''
**'''Squidward''': Finally, something to do! ''[plays clarinet as he peddles]''
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Aye-aye, captain! Long as I get paid! ''[peddles as says the word, "money" as a siren]''
**'''Sandy''': I'm on it! Yee-haw! ''[peddles really fast]''
**'''Plankton''': When I become chief, I'm gonna fire that guy. ''[puts on helmet and peddles]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Hey, I didn't know we had a radio.}}
{{L|''[The police officer gets closer.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Sing along, Barnacle Boy. I love this song!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|That's not a song, you twit! It's a police siren! Barnacles! We need time to solve the disappearing building mystery and we can't do that if we're arrested!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|I'm sorry. I was thinking about cabbage. You were saying?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Floor it!}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man floors the invisible boatmobile and they drive faster. The police officer continues to pursue them and keeps on peddling.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Barnacle Boy, I know a shortcut that would confuse anyone. Hold on! ''[drives a different way]''}}
{{L|''[The police officer is starting to get tired from peddling and Gary slithers by.]''}}

{{L|Police Officer|
**'''SpongeBob''': Meow.
**'''Patrick''': ''[breathing heavily]''
**'''Squidward''': ''[breathing heavily]''
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Money... ''[screams]'' Money...
**'''Sandy''': ''[peddles by Gary as she breathes heavily]''
**'''Plankton''': ''[breathing heavily]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|Chief|''[through walkie-talkie]'' Request update on the chase, Officer!}}

{{L|Police Officer|
**'''SpongeBob''': Want to succeed.... Having trouble... ''[gasps]'' Oh, there they are!
**'''Patrick''': ''[groans]'' I'm having trouble keeping up. ''[sighs]'' Oh! Hold on! I see them!
**'''Squidward''': ''[breathes]'' Thinking of a career change and... Oh, hold on. I see them!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': ''[groans]'' This peddlin' will be the end of me. ''[sighs]'' Wait! I see 'em!
**'''Sandy''': Targets in sight, sir!
**'''Plankton''': ''[groans]'' Curse my buff but minuscule legs! ''[grunts]'' Oh, wait! There they are!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Uh, Mermaid Man?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Not now, son. I'm trying to concentrate on all these devious twists and turns.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Uhh... Mermaid Man?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|They'll never catch us now! They couldn't keep up with the boatmobile!}}
{{L|''[The screen pans out to reveal that Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are just driving around the parking lot of Mrs. Puff's Boating School. The police officer finally catches up to them and parks at the front.]''}}

{{L|Police Officer|
**'''SpongeBob''': I'm bringing 'em in, sir!
**'''Patrick''': They are so busted!
**'''Squidward''': I get to arrest people! Hooray!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Ne'er-do-wells ready for the brig, captain!
**'''Sandy''': I'll bring 'em in, chief! 10-4!
**'''Plankton''': The fools will soon be in the big house!}}

=== The Sneaky Hermit On Cue ===
{{L|''[The sneaky hermit watches everything behind the building.]''}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': ''[evil laughter]'' They have arrested Mermaid Man for my crimes! Which doesn't sound fair really, but bah! I am a super villain and that is what we do! So, I guess I shall go do more villainous type stuff. ''[laughs]''
**'''Patrick''': Har-har-har! They've arrested the wrong people for my crimes! My crimes! They won't be looking for me now, which is good. Uh, I think I'll say, "har-har-har!". Har-har-har!
**'''Squidward''': Ha! They've arrested Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy for my crimes. Heh. Really disappointing 'cause where's the recognition? But they won't be looking for me now. ''[laughs]''
**'''Mr. Krabs''': ''[evil laughter]'' They've arrested Mermaid Man for me crimes! Oh, it sure warms me money purse. Now, I'll be free to steal anything I want! Buildings and money! Boats and money! Wallets with money in 'em! ''[laughs]''
**'''Sandy''': ''[evil laughter]'' That sheriff has arrested those hero varmits instead of yours truly! They won't be lookin' for me now. I'm in the clear like a window in a swimmin' pool. ''[laughs]''
**'''Plankton''': ''[evil laughter]'' The fools have arrested Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy for my crimes! My crimes! Leaving me free to steal everything I possibly can! Oh, the power is going to my head! Ouch! Ooh, my head. I mean ''[laughs]''}}

=== News Flash #1 ===
{{L|Johnny Elaine|News flash! It is believed that the masterminds behind the disappearance of Sand Stadium are none other than Bikini Bottom heroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. When questioned, the older hero had this to say, "Is that a microphone? Is it time for pudding? Do these pants feel damp to you?" The ex-heroes are now doing time in Bikini Bottom Jail. We will keep you updated with further updates.}}

=== Jailed ===
{{L|''[Meanwhile in Bikini Bottom Jail, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are placed in a cell together. The two heroes struggle to figure out the disappearance of the Sand Stadium.]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Now, let's go over it again. Are you sure you didn't hit the building-obliteration button when you were foolin' around with your utility belt?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|I'm sure of it, Barnacle Boy. I was full of cheesecake, I reached down to loosen my belt, and I pressed this button by accident. ''[pushes the same button again]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Oh! Geez! ''[stutters]'' I sure wish you'd stop fiddling with that thing. Ya make me nervous.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Nothin' to be afraid of, Barnacle Boy. It's just my chin-cam. ''[pulls out a picture of his chin]'' Lookie. Such a handsome chin. ''[pulls out another picture of his chin]'' And here's the picture I took at the Sand Stadium. Right before it vanished.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Well, that proves it wasn't you that caused the mess. This time at least.}}

{{L|Prison Guard|
**'''SpongeBob''': Ooh, I know a story about mess. And it's not about Gary's litter box. ''[laughs]'' It's about an inmate years ago called Messy Messerson, who some called him Stanley. Nice guy, nice guy.
**'''Patrick''': You wanna hear about mess? We had an inmate. Messy Messerson, I think. Eh, but we called him Stanley and—Whoa! ''[falls over]'' I think Stanley had a pony and—Whew!
**'''Squidward''': Hmph! What do you know about mess? We had an inmate here once. Messy Messerson was his name. Or Stanley or something. Anyway, he smelled worse than SpongeBob's shoes. ''[snickers]'' Shoes. ''[snickers]'' SpongeBob. ''[snickers]'' I still got it.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Argh. I know a thing or two about mess. I remember a filthy scurvy by the name of Messy Messerson. Or Stanley or something. Filthiest land-lubber that ever loved the land. Oh, the tales I can tell. Hee-hee.
**'''Sandy''': I'll tell y'all about mess. I remember an inmate called Messy Messerson. Or was it Stanley? Messy is a dump-truck in a twister. Soo-weet!
**'''Plankton''': Oh, you don't know what mess is. I remember an inmate, super messy. Probably had an electric messing ray. Messy Messerson, that was his name, but we called him Stanley. And—Whoa! ''[falls of the table]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Uh, yeah, thanks. Uh, somehow I don't think this is the work of someone called "Stanley".}}
{{L|Man Ray|No, it doesn't sound like Stanley's style at all. Stanley "Messy" Messerson likes to make a mess. The Sand Stadium vanished too cleanly.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Man Ray!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|''[gasps]'' Our second most arch nemesis!}}
{{L|Man Ray|That's right, super-zeroes! It's me!}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and Man Ray growl at each other for a bit. But stop.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|So, what are you in for?}}
{{L|Man Ray|I got caught jaywalking. Could you believe it?}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and Man Ray share a laugh.]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|You think that's bad? I got caught for having bad breath in a public place. Ho-ho!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|The Dirty Bubble?!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Our number #1 arch nemesis!}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and the Dirty Bubble growl at each other.]''}}

{{L|Prison Guard|
**'''SpongeBob''': That's enough of that, gentlemen!
**'''Patrick''': Oh, let's not go through that again!
**'''Squidward''': Oh, would you knock that off?!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Oh, not again!
**'''Sandy''': Oh, can it, fellers!
**'''Plankton''': Oh, brother! ''[hops up]'' Give it a rest!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Spoiled sport.}}

{{L|Prison Guard|
**'''SpongeBob''': Let's talk about the disappearance of the Sand Stadium. I think the stadium was a giant monster in disguise.
**'''Patrick''': Now, let's talk about the disappearance of the Sand Stadium. The monster who killed the butler could be in this...very...room.
**'''Squidward''': I have a theory about the disappearance of the Sand Stadium. Maybe a big monster musical note blew it out of Bikini Bottom!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Now, let's talk about the disappearance of the Sand Stadium. Maybe a huge monster of the deep ate it!
**'''Sandy''': Now, let's talk about the disappearance of the Sand Stadium. I think a huge monster truck dragged it away.
**'''Plankton''': Now, let's talk about ''[grunts]'' the disappearance of the Sand Stadium. ''[climbs back on the table]'' I think a giant monster robot teleported it to another dimension!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Monster?!}}

{{L|Prison Guard|
**'''SpongeBob''': In disguise, yeah! Or maybe it was the Sneaky Hermit.
**'''Patrick''': Monster?! ''[falls over again]'' Hey, maybe the Sneaky Hermit took the stadium.
**'''Squidward''': Monster note! Or possibly the Sneaky Hermit.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Stranger things happen at sea. Though it also could've been the Sneaky Hermit.
**'''Sandy''': It's a good theory! Or maybe it was the Sneaky Hermit.
**'''Plankton''': You got a better theory? Next thing you'll say it was the Sneaky Hermit.}}
{{L|Man Ray|The Sneaky Hermit. Of course! This crime shows all the signs that have been present throughout the hermit's criminal career!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|What signs? What does the Sneaky Hermit do?}}
{{L|''[Suddenly, the entire building of Bikini Bottom Jail shakes and vanishes into thin air, just like the Sand Stadium.]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|I think it would be fair to say that the Sneaky Hermit steals buildings.}}
{{L|Man Ray|A fine observation, my villainous companion. Now, if everyone will excuse us, this sudden freedom has renewed my eagerness for villainy. Come, Dirty Bubble! ''[leaves]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Ooh, let's start with jaywalking. They couldn't possibly catch us twice. ''[leaves]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|We should probably catch those two you know.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|All in good time, Barnacle Boy. All in good time. First, I think we've got a hermit to catch. We'll start with the beach 'cause hermits love the beach. To the invisible boatmobile away!}}

{{L|Prison Guard|
**'''SpongeBob''': ''[very dizzy]'' Nobody move! I think this building is unstable! ''[a ceiling tile falls on him]''
**'''Patrick''': ''[laying down]'' I guess I'll have to go back to my job straightening paper clips I've failed to—Oof! ''[a ceiling tile falls on him]''
**'''Squidward''': ''[very dizzy]'' Smell worse than SpongeBob's feet! ''[laughs]'' 'Cause his feet smell! Ha—Oof! ''[a ceiling tile falls on him]''
**'''Mr. Krabs''': ''[very dizzy]'' I'll have a captain's basket and a side order of—''[a ceiling tile falls on him]''
**'''Sandy''': Dang that monster truck! ''[a ceiling tile falls on her]''
**'''Plankton''': That hermit has style. ''[chuckles]'' I wonder if I could get a business card. ''[a ceiling tile falls on him]''}}

=== News Flash #2 ===
{{L|Johnny Elaine|News flash! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy have been cleared of suspicion in the disappearance of the Sand Stadium. Authorities are now on the lookout for a crab called the Sneaky Hermit. Who is still at large and may have accomplices.}}

That kid's got ice cream!

''[looks through binoculars and sees a citizen]'' Nothing. ''[sees a strong guy]'' Nothing. ''[sees Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in their invisible boatmobile]'' Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. ''[sees a citizen eating ice cream]'' More nothing.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Well, I'm not making much being a lookout, ''[grabs binoculars]'' but here's what I spy. ''[looks through binoculars and sees a citizen]'' Little nipper. ''[sees a strong guy]'' Another nipper. ''[sees Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in their invisible boatmobile]'' Old fellers in tights. ''[sees a citizen eating ice cream]'' Scallywag.

**'''Squidward''': I thought it was Mermaid Man. ''[looks through his binoculars and sees Mermaid Man up close]''
**'''Mr. Krabs''': False alarm. It's just the letter M. ''[looks through his binoculars and sees Mermaid Man up close]''
**'''Sandy''': Could've sworn I saw some oldies. ''[looks through his binoculars and sees Mermaid Man up close]''
**'''Plankton''': Hmm. ''[knocks on the binoculars]'' This equipment must be malfunctioning.}}

{{L|Ice Cream Vendor|What can I get you, gentlemen? Kelp sundae? Sea cucumber split? Information on any of the major super villains?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Super what-no? No, I'd like two scoops of high fiber ice cream with Brussels sprouts sprinkles. Mmm.}}
{{L|Ice Cream Vendor|Oh. Thought you might have been looking for a super villain. Someone hermit like? Bit sneaky?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|There's a sale on underpan—I—I mean, a Sneaky Hermit?!}}
{{L|Ice Cream Vendor|That's the one. Was here not that long back. Said something about being hungry. Something about the Krusty Krab.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Jumpin' jellyfish, Mermaid Man! The Sneaky Hermit must be at the Krusty Krab! We should go immediately.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Well, I don't need new undies, but I'm happy to go. To the Krusty Krab away! ''[he and Barnacle Boy leave Goo Lagoon]''}}
{{L|Ice Cream Vendor|Well, I got rid of them for ya.}}

{{L|Lookout|
**'''SpongeBob''': I will make sure you get a pretty badge for your service.
**'''Patrick''': Thanks. I'll make sure you get a Sneaky Hermit t-shirt.
**'''Squidward''': I think there's a form you can fill out for a thank you gift or something.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': You've come to the wrong place if you're after a tip, laddie.
**'''Sandy''': Thanks, old timer. I'll give you a big Texas hug later.

**'''Patrick''': Oh, hi, boss. Yeah, they're gone. Well, we shouldn't be having any more surprises like that again. ''[looks through his binoculars and sees Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble up close with masks on their faces]'' Ahh! ''[climbs up the beach umbrella]''
**'''Squidward''': Yes, Sneaky Hermit, they're gone. I won't slip like that again. ''[looks through his binoculars and sees Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble up close with masks on their faces]'' Ahh!! ''[hides under the ice cream stand again]'' Well, there goes that job.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Yes, Sneaky Hermit. I surely won't let anyone get past me sharp eyes again. ''[looks through his binoculars and sees Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble up close with masks on their faces]'' Argh! Aw, crabsticks. ''[hides under the ice cream stand again]''
**'''Sandy''': Yep. Don't know how those guys passed my eagle eye. Won't happen again. ''[looks through her binoculars and sees Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble up close with masks on their faces]'' Ah! Aw, nuts. ''[hides under the ice cream stand again]''

**'''Patrick''': Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will be my home! ''[looks at the picture of his ex-wife]'' If only you hadn't left me and taken the house. Now, all I wanna do is steal all of Bikini Bottom! And— ''[the doorbell rings and Lary meows]'' What?
**'''Squidward''': Soon, this whole wretched town will be mine! ''[looks at the picture of his ex-wife]'' I was happy with you. Why'd you take our house? Now, all I want is to steal all of Bikini Bottom! And— ''[the doorbell rings and Lary meows]'' Oh, just when I was getting into it.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Soon, I'll own everything! ''[evil laughter and looks at the picture of his ex-wife]'' Oh, my sweetness. You left me dry and took our home. And now I'm crabby and evil and wanna steal all of Bikini Bottom! And— ''[the doorbell rings and Lary meows]'' D'oh! Just when I was gettin' nice and angry!
**'''Sandy''': Soon, I'll have this whole town as my own personal spread! ''[looks at the picture of her ex-husband]'' Oh, my darlin'. You done left and took our house and turn me into a evil super villain! Bets on! ''[the doorbell rings and Lary meows]'' Who in tarnation could that be?
**'''Plankton''': Soon, I'll have it all! ''[looks at the picture of his ex-wife]'' You took my heart. And then our home. No wonder I'm evil. Now, I just want all of Bikini Bottom! And— ''[the doorbell rings and Lary meows]'' Ugh! This had better be good.}}

{{L|Man Ray|We'll help each other out. Hatch evil plans, make prank phone calls. It'll be fun! What do you say?}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': Ooh, friends. Sounds fun and could fit right into my own selfish and evil plans! ''[laughs evilly as Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble stare in confusion]'' You got it. ''[pulls out a bag]'' Distract Mermaid Man with this captive. Then we can play. Play evil!
**'''Patrick''': That sounds good. And will fit right into my own selfish and evil plans! ''[laughs evilly as Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble stare in confusion]'' Yeah, that sounds great. ''[pulls out a bag]'' I stole this from the mayor's house. Use it to distract Mermaid Man. Then we can do evil stuff.
**'''Squidward''': Hmm. This is perfect. And it'll fit right into my own selfish and evil plans! ''[laughs evilly as Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble stare in confusion]'' Yeah, okay, whatever. ''[pulls out a bag]'' Get this ungoofed captive off my hands, distract Mermaid Man with it, then we'll team up.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Argh. I like this idea. 'Cause it'll fit right into me own selfish and evil plans! ''[laughs evilly as Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble stare in confusion]'' It's a deal. ''[pulls out a bag]'' Take this money bag—I mean, uh, prisoner and distract Mermaid Man. Then we can do evil.
**'''Sandy''': That's a piece of luck. This will fit right into my own selfish and evil plans! ''[laughs evilly as Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble stare in confusion]'' Sounds good. ''[pulls out a bag]'' Take this wrigglin' critter to distract Mermaid Man. Then we can go do evil together.
**'''Plankton''': Yes, this new idea could fit right into my own selfish and evil plans! ''[laughs evilly as Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble stare in confusion]'' Good plan. ''[pulls out a bag]'' This captive should serve to distract Mermaid Man. Leaving us free for more evil!}}
{{L|Man Ray|Hurrah! I think this is going to work out just fine! Come, Dirty Bubble. Let's begin our alliance of sneakiness.}}

{{L|French Narrator|Pardon? Ooh, sorry. My mistake. Please carry on.}}
{{L|TV announcer|Thank you. ''[clears throat]'' The Krusty Krab. Here we find Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy sent to find the Sneaky Hermit. But the hermit is not here. Only tasty and nutritious meals at affordable prices.}}

**'''Squidward''': Oh, for crying out loud! Would you just keep the pepper?! ''[gives Mermaid Man the pepper grinder]''

**'''Patrick''': Yep. I saw Man Ray drag a wriggling sack into the Chum Bucket.
**'''Squidward''': You mean, like, Man Ray dragging a wriggling sack into the Chum Bucket?
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Well, if ya call Man Ray carrying a wriggling sack into the Chum Bucket suspicious, then yes.

**'''Plankton''': ''[groans]'' Ow, ow! ''[moans]'' This is horrible! I'm too important for this! I only got little legs! This is sizist and exhausting! Ow! ''[groans]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|That kid is so annoying.}}
{{L|Man Ray|Yes, my hollow spherical accomplice! But it'll prove an adequate distraction for our bumbling superheroes.}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|The Sneaky Hermit will be pleased. Let's invite our new chum to my lair. We can concoct our evil plans over herbal tea! ''[laughs]''}}

{{L|Dirty Bubble|You're too late, Moron Man! The mayor's child is trapped inside a vortex of stinkiness!

{{L|Mermaid Man|Oh, yeah. The kid. You're gonna be just fine. Oh, sweet merciful Neptune! What is that smell?!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|It's the vortex of stinkiness, Mermaid Man. ''[flips the switches on the machine]'' We've got to shut off this machine and free the captive.}}

{{L|Dirty Bubble|That's pretty much why we're here.}}

{{L|Barnacle Boy|Hey, no name calling during the truce, remember?}}

{{L|Hunter|
**'''SpongeBob''': I sense with my keen hunter senses that you seek the Sneaky Hermit.

=== News Flash #3 ===
{{L|Johnny Elaine|News flash! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy have enlisted the help of the finest hunter in Jellyfish Fields. It is believed that the Sneaky Hermit is somewhere in downtown Bikini Bottom. Not far from this very studio...''[the studio disappears]'' Um...we'll be right back.}}

=== The Final Battle ===
{{L|''[The scene changes to downtown Bikini Bottom.]''}}
{{L|TV announcer|Downtown Bikini Bottom, a fitting setting for our final battle. A dramatic location for the powers of good and evil to clash climatically. And a really good place for pizza.}}
{{L|''[The Sneaky Hermit is going around stealing many stuff and balancing them on his back. Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble pull over and exit the invisible boatmobile.]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|That hunter sure left in a hurry.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|I didn't even get a chance to say bye-bye.}}
{{L|Man Ray|Well, you were annoying, Dirty Bubble.}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|I was annoying?}}
{{L|Man Ray|All that disgusting belching.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Knock it off. It doesn't matter. We know all we need to know about the Sneaky Hermit.}}
{{L|Man Ray|Indeed. We'll soon put an end to the "Stinky" Hermit! ''[rimshot]''}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble share a good laugh.]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|The hermit's really in it for a surprise!}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble continue laughing. When all of a sudden, the Sneaky Hermit sneaks up behind them and steals the invisible boatmobile.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Oh, hey, Barnacle Boy, where did you park the invisible boatmobile?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Oh, I didn't park it, Mermaid Man. You did. ''[chuckles]'' It's just over—''[sees the invisible boatmobile missing and gasps]'' Oh my gosh!}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble gasp in a shocking surprise.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|The invisible boatmobile! It's been stolen!}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': And I'm the one who's got it!
**'''Patrick''': Oh, come on! It's just a boatmobile.
**'''Squidward''': Oh, quit blubbering. It's just a boatmobile.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Argh! That it has! By me!
**'''Sandy''': That's 'cause I done took it!
**'''Plankton''': It's just an old boatmobile. Sheesh!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, Man Ray, and the Dirty Bubble|The Sneaky Hermit!}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': They don't come any sneakier, boys.
**'''Patrick''': The Sneaky Hermit?!
**'''Squidward''': The very same.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Argh, the Sneaky Hermit! Argh!
**'''Sandy''': You sure got that right!
**'''Plankton''': Yes. So, bow down, lowly beings!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|You've been busy, Hermit. You've stolen almost the whole town.}}
{{L|Man Ray|And put it all on your back, too. It's reasonably impressive.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|You've stolen our invisible boatmobile, Sneaky Hermit!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|You stole our evil lairs!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Evil bears?!}}
{{L|''[The screen shows two koala bears with red, evil eyes.]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|But why, Hermit? Why did you do it?}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': I wanted the best home ever.
**'''Patrick''': Everyone needs a home.
**'''Squidward''': I needed a home.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Money. I mean, uh, I needed a home.
**'''Sandy''': You can't deny a lady a home.
**'''Plankton''': I wanted a good home.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|A home? You've got all of Bikini Bottom on your back!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|What's your plan? To put the whole town on your back? Then the next town? Then eventually the whole world?}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': Hmm....maybe.
**'''Patrick''': Uh, maybe.
**'''Squidward''': You, uh, could say that.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Um...perhaps...yeah.
**'''Sandy''': Uh...yep.
**'''Plankton''': That's the plan.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|All on your back? Where will you stand?}}
{{L|Man Ray|Wow! I'm an evil genius who wants to take over the world, but even I'm not that crazy!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Enough talk! Can we fight already?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|''[facing the wrong way]'' Hurrah! Prepare to make a fool of yourself, ''[Barnacle Boy turns him around]'' Sneaky Hermit!}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': I am already there, Mermaid Man!
**'''Patrick''': It's a little late for that!
**'''Squidward''': Ha! I'll beat you to it!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': I like to see ya try!
**'''Sandy''': I'll fool you!
**'''Plankton''': You mean of you, Mermaid Man!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|I hope you brought a stunt double, Hermit. Because this is gonna hurt.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|''[summons a swarm of jellyfish]'' Sea creatures of the deep unite!}}
{{L|''[The Sneaky Hermit runs away. The hermit's stunt double (depending on which character) punches and kicks away the jellyfish. He then puts another building onto his back.]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|By all things dirty, I—uh—''[stutters]'' Make you dirty!}}
{{L|''[The Dirty Bubble charges at the Sneaky Hermit's stunt double. The stunt double grabs a helicopter and blows the Dirty Bubble away with the propeller. The Dirty Bubble is sent flying into a pile of trash with a character's face in his mouth (depending on which character).]''}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|''[The Sneaky Hermit continues to steal buildings and goes for the giant sea needle in the middle of the city.]''}}
{{L|Man Ray|The Sneaky Hermit's about to steal the Sea Needle!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Aw, nuts! That's the last building in Bikini Bottom.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Oh, barnacles.}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': ''[tries to lift the Sea Needle, but it's stuck]'' Oh, I cannot lift it! Why, why, why?
**'''Patrick''': ''[tries to lift the Sea Needle, but it's stuck]'' Why is this building so hard?!
**'''Squidward''': ''[tries to lift the Sea Needle, but it's stuck]'' Oh, why can't I lift this building?
**'''Mr. Krabs''': ''[tries to lift the Sea Needle, but it's stuck]'' Why's this building givin' me troubles?
**'''Sandy''': ''[tries to lift the Sea Needle, but it's stuck]'' Oh, why is this buildin' bein' stubborn?
**'''Plankton''': ''[tries to lift the Sea Needle, but it's stuck]'' What's wrong with this building?!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|I know! I know! It's locked! Lookie! ''[points to a lock at the very top of the building]'' You could just take that lock off and then take the building. You can even use those window-washer platforms to get up there.}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': Hey, thanks.
**'''Patrick''': Thanks!
**'''Squidward''': Ha! Thanks.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Thanks!
**'''Sandy''': Much obliged.
**'''Plankton''': Thanks, fool.}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|''[groans]'' Why do you good guys have to be so helpful?}}
{{L|''[The Sneaky Hermit climbs onto the winder-washing platform and goes up.]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|We should, um, probably try to stop that from happening. ''[chuckles]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Excellent idea, Barnacle Boy! All those in favor?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, Man Ray, and the Dirty Bubble|Aye!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|All against?}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': Nay!
**'''Patrick''': Nay!
**'''Squidward''': Nay!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Nay!
**'''Sandy''': Nay!
**'''Plankton''': Nay!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Quiet you!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Alright, there's not much left to say but...to the window-washing platforms on the side of the Sea Needle ''[as Mermaid Man talks, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble get annoyed and get a head start]'' building to rescue Bikini Bottom from the clutches of the evil Sneaky Hermit, ''[breathes and Barnacle Boy grabs him by the arm]'' away!}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, Man Ray, and the Dirty Bubble climb on the window-washing platforms and go up after the Sneaky Hermit. The hermit is struggling to reach the top.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|You'll never get away with this, you sneaky thing.}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Can we hurry this up? I'm getting a bit dizzy here.}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': Okie doke. Have a bite of my hermit nippers!
**'''Patrick''': With pleasure. Prepare for hermit nippers!
**'''Squidward''': You asked for it! Behold my hermit nippers!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': You got it, laddie. Prepare for hermit nippers! ''[chortles]''
**'''Sandy''': You got it! Hermit nippers comin' at ya!
**'''Plankton''': Of course. Taste my hermit nippers!}}
{{L|''[The Sneaky Hermit fires his hermit nippers at the Dirty Bubble. But he dodges all of them.]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|''[laughs]'' Your nippers are no match for my dirty breath of doom!}}
{{L|''[The Dirty Bubble inhales and blows a horrible stench of bad breath at the Sneaky Hermit, but the hermit dodges and it affected Mermaid and Barnacle Boy instead.]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Oh, geez! ''[coughs]'' Whew. That's worse than Mermaid Man's socks.}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': Hey, you should try my sneaky frightener!
**'''Patrick''': Ha! Let me try. I give you the sneaky frightener!
**'''Squidward''': Ha! Try my sneaky frightener on for size!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Argh, funny. But taste the sting of me sneaky frightener!
**'''Sandy''': Funny, but not as funny as my sneaky frightener!
**'''Plankton''': Ha! Tremble before my sneaky frightener!}}
{{L|''[The Sneaky Hermit forms a ball and launches it over to Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. The sneaky frightener floats behind Barnacle Boy's ear.]''}}
{{L|Sneaky frightener|Boo!}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy jump in fright and the ball pops like a bubble.]''}}
{{L|Man Ray|Okay, now this is getting weird.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|The powers of good will prevail! Behold! Raging whirlpool!}}
{{L|''[Barnacle Boy performs his raging whirlpool technique at the Sneaky Hermit. But the hermit dodges the attack and it hits the Dirty Bubble.]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|''[spins around]'' Hey, w-watch it! You're gonna make me s-s-spill my lunch!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Mermaid Man, that's it! Spilling! The hunter told us that if the hermit loses balance, then everything on its back could fall off. And the hermit is susceptible to sneezing. You know what that means?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|We're having prune and broccoli pudding for desert tonight?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|No, you old coot. Pepper! We use some pepper and make the hermit sneeze.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Good idea, Barnacle Boy! If only we had some.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|You got some in your pocket from before!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Oh, this isn't helping at all.}}
{{L|''[Everyone reaches the very top of the Sea Needle.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|''[holds out the pepper grinder]'' Hey! Here's some pepper! Okay, Hermit, I've got a handful of pepper here. And I gotta warn ya, it's especially tasty. The jig is up!}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': It should take more than pep—uh oh.
**'''Patrick''': Pepper? Is that all you—uh oh.
**'''Squidward''': Ha! Pepper. As if that—uh oh.
**'''Mr. Krabs''': All you got is pepper? ''[laughs, but pauses]'' Oh, barnacles.
**'''Sandy''': Is that all you got? I—oh dagnabbit!
**'''Plankton''': Oh, come on. Pepper? I mean oh dear.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|By the power of Neptune, I give you a handful of delicious pepper! ''[sprays pepper in the Sneaky Hermit's face]''}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': Ah—ah—ah—ah—
**'''Patrick''': Ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—
**'''Squidward''': Ah—''[grunts as he is about to sneeze]''
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Ah—''[grunts as he is about to sneeze]''

{{L|Mermaid Man|''[looks down]'' You know, being up here doesn't feel safe anymore.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|You got that right, old man. Let's scoot.}}
{{L|''[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy let go of the ropes and descend down.]''}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': Ah—ah—ah—ah—

**'''Sandy''': Ah—ah—
**'''Plankton''': Ah—ah—ah—}}
{{L|Man Ray|I think those bumbling ninnies might be onto something. Let's get out of here!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Not so fast, Man Ray! I'm still feeling ''[Man Ray lets go of the rope and descends down]'' queaaaaaassssyyyyy!}}

{{L|Sneaky Hermit|
**'''SpongeBob''': Achoooooo! ''[flies off the building and soars across the sky]'' I am flying!
**'''Patrick''': Achoooooo! ''[flies off the building and soars across the sky]'' Hey, I can see my house from here!
**'''Squidward''': Achooooo! ''[flies off the building and soars across the sky]'' Oh, I hope I paid my health insurance!
**'''Mr. Krabs''': Achooooo! ''[flies off the building and soars across the sky]'' Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money!
**'''Sandy''': Achoooo! ''[flies off the building and soars across the sky]'' I ain't no flyin' fox!
**'''Plankton''': Aaaaaccchoooo! ''[flies off the building and soars across the sky]'' Not again! This isn't happening!}}
{{L|''[As the Sneaky Hermit flies away into the distance, all of the buildings he stole return to their proper positions. Bikini Bottom is back to the way it is.]''}}

=== Ending ===
{{L|''[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy land safely on the ground.]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Well, we sure did teach that little critter something about not stealing buildings and storing them on your back and plotting to take over the world.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|We sure did. And teaming up with our enemies worked.}}
{{L|''[Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble land safely on the ground.]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|''[feeling sick]'' Spinning, spinning, spinning! ''[goes somewhere to throw up]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and Man Ray|Eeewww!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Feeling good now, Dirty Bubble?}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|No. I think I'm almost back to feeling evil again.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Oh.}}
{{L|Man Ray|So, would you like to come and throw rocks with us?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|No, we're still good I'm afraid.}}
{{L|Man Ray|Oh. So, um... Ah, the heck with it. Come, Dirty Bubble, I'm tired of all this goodness! Let's go steal chocolate chips out of the prison warden's cookies!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Now you're talking. Time for some evil!}}
{{L|''[Man Ray draws on Mermaid Man's face.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Evil?}}
{{L|''[Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble run off into the streets to continue doing evil.]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Uh...Mermaid Man?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Yes, son?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Are you going to, uh, fix that anytime soon?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|All in good time, Barnacle Boy.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|So, what do you say we go see the rest of that performance at the Sand Stadium?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|We're going back to the football game?! Hot dog! I love football!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Oh, geez. It's not foot—''[stutters]'' Oh, whatever. Yep. Let's go see the rest of the "football game."}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Yippee! ''[he and Barnacle Boy enter the invisible boatmobile]'' Ice cream, ice cream. Can I have ice cream?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|As much as you want, old chump.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Hee, hee! Best day ever! ''[drives away]''}}
{{L|TV announcer|And so once again, the forces of badness have been outdone by the forces of goodness. And thank goodness, there's an end to the madness. Tune in next time for another mostly interesting episode of ''The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy''!}}
{{L|French Narrator|Ah, monsieur, you really are very good at that.}}
{{L|TV announcer|Thanks again, my French companion. There's a funny story about how I got into cartoons. You see, when I was just a kid, I had this deep voice.}}
