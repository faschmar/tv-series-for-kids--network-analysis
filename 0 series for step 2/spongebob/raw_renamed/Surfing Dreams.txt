{{L|''[at Squidward's house, Squidward is humming as he is arriving at his bathroom toilet when SpongeBob, equipped with his shorts and surfboard, pops out of it, Squidward screams]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Squidward! Wanna go surfing?}}
{{L|Squidward|What? How'd you? Where'd you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come on, Squidward! Since you already got a surfboard and shorts!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[a surfboard and shorts magically appear with him, Squidward notices them]'' What the?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And since we're already at the beach!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Squidward magically appears at Goo Lagoon]'' Wha?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And the water with a huge wave behind us! ''[SpongeBob and Squidward are on their surfboards in the water, a huge wave goes for Squidward]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Nooooo! ''[Squidward wakes up from the nightmare, he looks around to see it's not a reality, he does a sigh of relief]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Squidward! Wanna go surfing? ''[Squidward screams, gets off his beach chair, and runs off]'' Hmmm. I guess surfing isn't his thing.}}
