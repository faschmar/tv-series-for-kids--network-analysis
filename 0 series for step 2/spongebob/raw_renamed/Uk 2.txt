{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, remember when we saw the London Eye?}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Look, Patrick. Trafalgar Square. Wasn't it beautiful.}}
{{L|Patrick|No. The lions are scary.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Those lions won't hurt you Patrick. Why they've been there for hundreds of years.}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, that just means they're hungry. Come on!}}
{{L|''[A photo showing SpongeBob and Patrick next to Abbey Road appears.]''}}
