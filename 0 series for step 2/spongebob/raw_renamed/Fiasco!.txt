{{L|Patrick|''[walks down the street wearing a tie, green jeans, a hat and carrying a briefcase. He stops and rips off his tie]'' Uhh. Such a tired day at the office. ''[looks at his watch]'' Boy, am I famished. I sure wish I knew the best restaurant in Bikini Bottom. ''[smell comes and Patrick's stomach morphs into a nose shape]'' From where has this glorious scent come?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[comes to Patrick]'' Hark, the odor you seek is before you.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[jumps out from Krusty Krab's doors wearing a leotard]'' At the Krusty Krab, where the tastiest sandwich in the seas is grilled to perfection by our expert fry cook. ''[raises hand to SpongeBob who comes out sky sliding on rainbow holding a spatula]'' And served with a smile by our friendly waiter. ''[Squidward arrives on a dolphin with a platter of Krabby Patties and gives the plate to Patrick, Patrick pours the Krabby Patties into his mouth, then it reveals that it was all a storyboard planned by SpongeBob for a commercial]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uhh, Patrick gobbles down the patties. Nom nom nom nom nom.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wait a minute. Why am I dressed in a leotard?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, cause you're the mascot.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Nah, I don't think so! ''[he tears off the storyboard pictures on the wall as SpongeBob looks in horror, some pieces of the shreds flies into SpongeBob's face and he blows it off him]'' We need a gimmick that's nothing short of a masterpiece.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesdays! ''[Mr. Krabs stops walking and SpongeBob bumps into him. Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob out of the kitchen. SpongeBob looks depressed and sighs louder and louder and louder which irritates Squidward.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, for dolphins sakes! Do tell what's troubling you so!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping.}}
{{L|Squidward|Shocking.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimmick.}}
{{L|Squidward|Sounds like you'd better stop bothering me and put on your thinking cap.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Great idea, Squidward! ''[zooms off]''}}
{{L|Squidward|That'll keep him out of my hair. ''[rattling engine noises are heard and smoke engulfs around Squidward. Squidward sees SpongeBob wearing a big blue machine of his head saying Thinking as SpongeBob thinks really hard for an idea. Covers his nose]'' Of course, he actually has one. ''[Squidward leaves his cash register and sees a strange patron squirting ketchup all over the Krabby Patties. He then picks them up and drops them all over the floor]'' To each, his own.}}
{{L|Fiasco|Mustard!}}
{{L|Squidward|Yes, your freakishness. ''[he swipes the mustard from Squidward's hand and squirts it all over the platter. Squidward sighs in disgust as mustard splashes onto his face]''}}
{{L|Fiasco|''[drops the empty mustard condiment as he is finished]'' Like our own fleeting existence, an untimely end has come upon this Krabby value meal. ''[he notices something on the platter and scrapes it off before he leaves]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Good riddance. ''[just as Squidward was about to spray the table, he quickly notices what the patron has done on the platter]'' What's this? Something's familiar about those ketchup swirls. ''[gasps]'' Sweet Neptune! Could that have been...}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah, yeah enough dilly-dallying. Now, help me with the garbage Mr. Squidward. ''[Mr. Krabs takes the platter and tries to throw it away, but Squidward takes it from him]''}} 
{{L|Squidward|That's not garbage, it's a Fiasco!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ok, let's not overdo it.}}
{{L|Squidward|No, no, no, you don't get it! It's the work of Fiasco the artist! ''[pulls out the Art Wonk magazine]'' He was featured in last month's Art Wonk magazine!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[reads the magazine and sees the picture of Fiasco and his art in it]'' Heh, you call this art? Looks like a swappy's footlocker.}}
{{L|Squidward|It all makes sense now! The dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow! This is directly out of his early abstract experiments!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[takes the Fiasco from Squidward]'' Ohh, what is this?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[takes it back from SpongeBob]'' This is an authentic Fiasco!}}
{{L|Customers|A Fiasco? ''[gets up from their tables and looks at the Fiasco in amazement]'' Ooh!}}
{{L|Dave|An original Fiasco, you say?}}
{{L|Gus|He's one of the famous picture-drawing artistes!}}
{{L|Nancy-Suzy Fish|Just look at his audacious use of pickle in this piece.}}
{{L|Incidental 27|''[stutters]'' What's your asking price?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, it's simply not for sale, not even for a million dollars.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hold it! ''[takes the Fiasco]'' I'll take a million for it.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[takes it back]'' It's not yours to sell! I found it!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Me plate, me buns, me mustard, ''[tries to take it from Squidward]'' me Fiasco.}}
{{L|Squidward|You tried to throw it away! ''[pulls it back]'' It's mine!}}
{{L|Farfel Bainbridge|Let's not be hasty. It belongs toâ€¦neither of you. Farfel Bainbridge: Curator of the Bikini Bottom Art Museum. We curators have a way of sniffing these things out. ''[takes the Fiasco from Squidward and examines it. He sniffs it for a little bit]'' ''[gasps]'' It's authentic! Aahh! Which makes this a national treasure! ''[everyone cheers as Farfel places the Fiasco back on the table and puts a glass lid around it]'' And for preservation, it must be hermetically sealed! ''[blows his whistle]'' And guarded by Bikini Bottom's finest! ''[three policemen rip off their costumes, revealing themselves]''}}
{{L|Officer John|Ready for duty, sir!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Great idea, Farkle. Gotta protect me valuable property.}}
{{L|Farfel Bainbridge|Well, technically, it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the people of Bikini Bottom. Unfortunately, they'll have to set foot in this grease-trap to get a look at this great piece of art.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, so now you're a restaurant critic. ''[goes to a scene where the Krusty Krab has a really long line waiting to see the Fiasco]'' Step up! Step up for your free glimpse at the Fiasco masterpiece! ''[Evelyn and Frankie look at the Fiasco]'' Alright, you've had your look. Now hold up your end of the bargain!}}
{{L|Frankie Billy|Two Krabby Patties, please.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Each!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[while all the customers are lined up, Plankton sneaks up behind a small rock outside of the Chum Bucket]'' So, what have you got for me today, huh? ''[looks through his telescope]'' No Krabby Patty in sight. ''[notices the customers looking at the Fiasco]'' What? What's this? Looks like a chewed-up Krabby Patty. A perfect sample from which to reverse engineer a whole Krabby Patty! ''[gets down and paddles to the Krusty Krab with a tiny bag on a unicycle]'' Thanks, Eugene. You just made my job a whole lot easier.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[As Mr. Krabs counts his money and sniffs some of them from his valuable success, he hears a loud scream in the dining room]'' I know that scream anywhere! It's me profits dying! ''[opens his office door and sees Plankton making a getaway with the Fiasco in his bag]'' Stop that thief!}}
{{L|Plankton|Don't worry, Krabs! I'm just taking out the trash for ya!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Stop thief! ''[pushes the alarm button and emergency bell rings and alarm blares; Cut to the police car driving after Plankton]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Heh, heh, heh, that was almost too easy. Plankton old boy, you're home-free! ''[Just then, he hears the sirens of the police cars. As he turns around, he notices several more police cars following him at high pursuit.]''}}
{{L|Officer John|Stop thief!}}
{{L|Plankton|Ahh! ''[paddles faster]'' What's with the police?! It's just a bag of garbage! ''[the police chases Plankton into the streets of Bikini Bottom and passes by the Movie Palace. Plankton manages to take refuge in the movie theater]'' What's going on?}}
{{L|Female movie character|How long do you think we'll be here?}}
{{L|Male movie character|I don't know. But my stomach feels all tingly.}}
{{L|Female movie character|Mine does too. ''[the movie characters slowly attempt to kiss, until Officer Rob bursts through the screen]''}}
{{L|Officer Rob|Hey you! Yeah, you in the chair!}}
{{L|Officer John|Don't move! ''[the cops burst out of the screen and chases Plankton out of the movie theater and into the supermarket]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[as the cops search all over the market, Plankton hides in a batch of flowers but his eyes gets all watery due to the pollen]'' Achoo! ''[the cops turn around and sees where Plankton is hiding]'' Blasted pollen allergies! ''[Plankton notices that the cops are looking at him and quickly runs out of the market as the cops chase him from behind. He somehow manages to take refuge in a floating satellite in outer space, thinking that he is safe.]'' Ahh, I should be safe in space. ''[he hears the hatch door open and sees that the cops are still after him only in spacesuits this time]''}}
{{L|Officer John|Stop thief!}}
{{L|Plankton|You gotta be kidding me! ''[exits out of the satellite as the cops pursue from behind. Sooner or later, Plankton becomes exhausted from being chased around by the cops. He then stumbles upon Patrick's rock]'' Hello? Hello? ''[knocks]'' Open up! ''[continues knocking]'' Open up!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[opens his rock as he is in his purple robe]'' Do you mind? Some of us have nothing to do tomorrow morning! ''[slams his rock]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Wait, what? ''[looks around and sees SpongeBob's house and bursts in the front door with a wooden spoon in his hand]'' Hey, keep your hands where I can see em'! ''[SpongeBob raises his hands in the air]'' Ok you two, against the wall! ''[SpongeBob and Gary get off of the chair and sofa and walk up towards the wall]'' That's it. Nice and slow. ''[Plankton walks into the house and places the bag on the table revealing the Fiasco he has stolen to SpongeBob. Plankton jumps up onto SpongeBob's chair]'' You gotta help me! Ever since I left the Krusty Krab, I've had all kinds of heat on me! It's so bizarre! Normally, when I steal something from the Krusty Krab, it's Krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops. So if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I-I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune.}}
{{L|Plankton|Really?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back.}}
{{L|Plankton|Interesting. It appears I've won more than I bargained for.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do.}}
{{L|Plankton|You mean hold onto it until it's really worth something?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, you need to turn yourself in.}}
{{L|Plankton|Turn myself-What?! If I go down, we all go down! You're harboring an art thief!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Who's that?}}
{{L|Plankton|Me, you imbecile!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Plankton|Not only that, you're an accomplice to the crime, yeah.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Really?}}
{{L|Plankton|And not only that, but Gary's an accomplice too!}}
{{L|Gary|Meow?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now you've gone too far!}}
{{L|Plankton|No, you have! Criminal Accomplice!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't believe you're calling me that!}}
{{L|Plankton|Believe it, Man Boy!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[comes in and appears to be eating something]'' Hey! What did I tell you before? I'm trying to get some shuteye!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, what are you eating?}}
{{L|Patrick|The hors d'oeuvres you left on the table. ''[an empty plate is shown as it reveals that Patrick is eating the Fiasco that Plankton stole. SpongeBob and Plankton gasp in horror as Patrick swallows the Fiasco and burps]'' Not bad.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!}}
{{L|Plankton|Ohh, he's an accomplice too!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[bursts through the front door with the cops behind him]'' Here they are, Officers! These idiots have been causing a ruckus. Interrupting my beauty sleep.}}
{{L|Officer John|Well, well, well. If it isn't the art thief himself. Drop the spoon. ''[Plankton throws the spoon away after realizing he has no place to run anymore]'' You're all under arrest until we figure this out. ''[puts handcuffs on Squidward's wrists]''}}
{{L|Squidward|But what do you mean "all"? ''[stammering]'' I'm not under arrest! I..I..I..uhh.. These are idiots! They're causing a ruckus! I..I want sleep! ''[cuts to the Bikini Bottom Police Station]''}}
{{L|Officer John|''[locks Plankton away in jail as SpongeBob, Patrick, Gary, and Mr. Krabs stand there and watch]'' Thanks for clearing this whole mess up, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Of course, Officer. Heh, can't let me fry cook rot in this place. It'll ruin me business! Especially, now that the Fiasco's finito! ''[begins to cry]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[thinks for a second and comes up with an idea, snaps his fingers]'' Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution. ''[cuts to the Krusty Krab with a really long line]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Thanks very much. Enjoy the show. You sure saved the day boy-yo.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[stands behind the X-ray and presents the Fiasco he accidentally ate to the customers, which amazes them. As he is showing it to them, he giggles for a little bit]'' X-rays tickle.}}
{{L|Fiasco|Such artistic genius! ''[throws his paintings on the floor and smashes them to bits]'' I'll never paint again!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[reveals that he is still behind bars at the Bikini Bottom Police Station]'' Hey, don't I get a phone call?}}
