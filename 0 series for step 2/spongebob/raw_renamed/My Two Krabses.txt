{{L|''[The episode starts off at the Krusty Krab.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Ah, it's finally my lunchtime. My only respite from these cretins and all the slop they call food.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Patrick eats his lunch]'' Hello!}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, let's see what delectable treats I packed myself today.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yoink! ''[Mr. Krabs grabs Squidward's treats]'' You know the rules, no outside food in me restaurant. Oh, and, uh, Mr. Squidward, I've got a hot date tonight. So don't let no one bother me for the next few hours. I'm gonna be in the tanning bed, browning the leather. ''[Spanks himself]'' ''[laughs]''.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hello!}} 
{{L|Squidward|''[groans]''}} 
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yeah... see here. ''[pulls out a box of dried kelp strips]'' Hmm... dried kelp strips? Nah. ''[tosses the box and grabs a bottle of reduced fat sea water]'' Reduced fat sea water? That's weird. ''[tosses the bottle]'' Jackpot! Ice cream sandwich!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs tosses the bag, takes a bite from the ice cream sandwich, and opens the desk, revealing a tanner inside. He then spins the ice cream sandwich on his finger, then unzips and exits his shell. He puts on goggles and headphones, kicks the ice cream sandwich on the shell's finger, still spinning, and shell-less Mr. Krabs enters the tanner.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oooh, nice and toasty in here. ''[points to shell]'' I'll be back for you later.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs closes his desk, and the sandwich falls on the shell. The ice cream starts to melt inside the shell. The scene cuts to SpongeBob, who opens the kitchen door.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I got a Krabby Patty for my favorite Pat! A patty-pat, for my favorite Pat! ''[SpongeBob sets the Krabby Patty on the table]'' Here you go, Patrick.}}
{{L|''[Patrick eats the patty, but suddenly stops.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, mama, it's hot in here!}}
{{L|Patrick|What was that?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, Neptune, I'm melting!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs' air conditioning must be malfunctioning! He could be violently uncomfortable!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob kicks the door to Mr. Krabs' office open, and he and Patrick run inside the office.]''|}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sarcastically]'' No, wait. Don't.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams as he sees Mr. Krabs' shell with melted ice cream]'' Mr. Krabs! Are you okay?! ''[starts to cry]'' Oh, speak to me...}}
{{L|''[A shot of Mr. Krabs is shown dancing in the tanning bed]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob cries]''}}
{{L|Patrick|This doesn't look good. ''[He grabs some of the melted ice cream]'' He melted all over the floor. ''[Eats the melted ice cream]'' Hmm, strawberry! Poor guy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob (crying)|Oh, Mr. Krabs! A tasty puddle... He's-he's-he's deeeaaad! ''[Cries in the cash register, as Squidward takes a look at Mr. Krabs' shell.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Laughs]'' Oh, oh, look at that. And right before his big date tonight.  What a shame.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A date? ''[A heart appears in the top of SpongeBob's hands]'' Oh, must love die meltily in my arms too? ''[The heart melts in SpongeBob's hands and he continues crying]''}}
{{L|Squidward|I guess he's just an empty shell of the man used to be. ''[snickers]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[stops crying]''Hey, Squidward, you're right! Only Mr. Krabs' inside is melted, his shell is fine! Maybe if we fill this back up with organs, he'll be okay.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick runs off with Mr. Krabs' shell.]''|}}
{{L|Squidward|Say what now?}}
{{L|''[Next shot is of the Chum Bucket]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|I didn't do it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We would like to purchase one large Drum of Chum, please.}}
{{L|Patrick|Extra organ-y.}}
{{L|Plankton|Say what? How do I know this isn't a plot to steal my secret chum formula? ''[A brief short pause occurs, and after that, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton all laugh, and SpongeBob gives Plankton some money, and he takes it.]'' Yoink! ''[Karen takes out the Drum of Chum through the door.]'' Enjoy your chum drum. Yum, yum!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, Plankton! Love you! ''[transitions to the inside of SpongeBob's house]'' Well, alright. Let's put some kick back in this crab!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob takes off the lid of the drum with his leg, and, while he holds Mr. Krabs' shell mouth open, Patrick grabs the chum drum and tries to put it in but makes a mess all over the walls and the floor, then, he puts it in his mouth, and pushes it in then it didn’t work, so Patrick kicks it.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob: Hmm, we're still missing something... ''[he gets an idea]'' Oh! ''[SpongeBob takes off his shoes, and starts rubbing his socks on the floor, to produce electricity.]'' A little zaparooni ought to do it. The spark of life! ''[SpongeBob points at Mr. Krabs' shell with chum and zaps it. And soon, the chum from the chum drum starts to fill all around the shell, creating a creature named Chum Krabs.]'' He's alive! He's alive! Oh, he's alive!}} 
{{L|''[Patrick and SpongeBob walk up to Chum Krabs, and Patrick looks very closely at him with his one big eye.]''}}
{{L|Patrick: Mr. Krabs seems... kind of dumb now...}}
{{L|SpongeBob: Well Patrick, he has had a rough day. We'll just have to remind him of everything that makes him him again. Don't you worry, Mr. K. We'll have you right back up to speed before you're big date tonight. I promise.}}
{{L|''[Chum Krabs trying to speak up]''}}
{{L|''[Next shot is back in the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|''[A pop-up thermometer comes out of Mr. Krabs' side, indicating he's done.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oooh, I'm done. ''[Mr. Krabs opens the tanner and feels around for his shell, but it is not there so he pops out.]'' Where'd me shell go? I'm never that careless with me carapace. ''[watch beeps]'' Oh no, I'm running late. Just have to grab me spare suit from home. ''[He peers out of the door and sees the restaurant is packed.]'' Let's see, if I time this right, no one'll notice me naked nethers. ''[He jumps behind the customers and stays out of sight behind a baby carrier. The baby begins to cry and the mother takes it out, and then he hides behind Bubble Bass. He successfully makes it outside, looks around, and hides behind the sign post. Then he runs off, hiding behind buildings.]''}}
{{L|''[Scene changes to SpongeBob's house where he and Patrick are sitting at a table with Chum Krabs. On the table sits a pile of money and a plate of cookies.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay Mr. Krabs, this is your final test. What do you like more: money or cookies?}}
