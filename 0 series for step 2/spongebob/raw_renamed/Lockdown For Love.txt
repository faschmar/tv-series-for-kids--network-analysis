{{L|''[The episode starts at the [[Chum Bucket]], which the bucket's handle falls to the ground, this is because Plankton and Karen are coming out of it, with a hot air balloon shaped like a heart for a date.]''}}
[[Category:Transcripts]]
{{L|Karen|Ah, I'm floating on air! A balloon ride, a candle-light dinner, and our wedding song is playing! Oh, this day is perfect.}}
{{L|Plankton|No, you're perfect, Karen. You're the best computer wife a copepod ever could have! ''[types on keyboard]'' Bon-bon?}}
{{L|Karen|Oh, I shouldn't.}}
{{L|Karen|Thank you, Plankton. This is truly a date to remember.}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, my love, you haven't seen anything yet. ''[runs dressed as Ray Ray]'' For you, my love! ''[passes a rose to Karen using his tongue]''}}
{{L|Karen|Oh, Ray Ray! ''[laughs and sniffs rose]'' Aah.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[combs hair]'' That's right, baby. Ray Ray is at your service. ''[shines teeth]''}}
{{L|Karen|Ray Ray, you've got my cooling fans running on high. ''[grabs Plankton and knocks down table]'' Ha, ha. Get over here and give me some sugar! ''[as Plankton and Karen are about to kiss, Plankton sees Mr. Krabs down from above.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Huh?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|♪Do do do do do♪ ''[yawns]'' What a long day. [he gets in his boat as he leaves the formula from behind.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[looks down at the formula]'' ''[angelic singing]'' Uh...eh...ehh! Ahhh! I can't take it!}}
{{L|Karen|What is it, Plankton?}}
{{L|Plankton|Hold that thought, baby. I uh- I forgot something down here. I'll be right back! ''[jusps off from the balloon]'' Can't believe this is really happening. ''[falls to the ground]'' The Krabby Patty secret formula is finally mine! Huh? ''[goes thru the formula, every time he touches it, his hand goes thru the formula]'' Huh? Eh... ''[The formula disappears]'' Ehh! ''[looks for the formula]'' Hm, eh, ah, eh, eh! Is this some kind of horrible nightmare? What? ''[goes back into the Chum Bucket, just to find the projector 3000.]'' A projector? You tricked me with a simulation?}}
{{L|Karen|It was a test, Plankton! And you failed! You fail every time when it comes to our romance.}}
{{L|Plankton|Right, so I goof up one time and now I'm the bad guy?}}
{{L|Karen|One time? Failed one time? ''[Numbers show up on her screen]'' How about 4,700,000 and- ''[glitching]'' Error, er-er-error.}}
{{L|Plankton|But baby cakes, I left to go get the Krabby Patty secret formula. For me... and you... You know... for us! Ehhh?}}
{{L|Karen|Listen, Sheldon. You need to show me a interruption-free romantic date night because until that happens, no one is leaving the Chum Bucket. ''[presses an alarm that makes the place go on lockdown]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Aah! ''[a brick wall crushes the front doors as the Chum Bucket's glove grabs some tinfoil as it places it on top of the roof and puts a rubber band on it.]'' ''[Karen grabs Plankton]'' Oof!}}
{{L|Karen|You better not mess this one up, Ray Ray. ''[pushes Plankton off her hand]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Ah! ''[bubble translation cuts to the next scene]'' ♪Da da da da doo doo♪ I think Karen's favorite "scrap electronics stew" ought to do the trick. ''[laughing]'' Yep. Huh? ''[notices that there is a window]'' I guess it wouldn't hurt to have just a little peek at the Krusy Krab. ''[climbs on the window]'' Hmm.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|♪Dee dee doo dee♪ What a long day. ''[yawns]'' ''[he gets in his boat and leaves the formula behind again.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[gasps]'' It's really out there! And this time it's not a hologram! ''[scratching the window and whimpering]'' ''[gets a screwdriver to untwist one of the nails attached to the window.]'' Uh, uh..}}
{{L|Karen|''[clears throat]'' Plankton! What are you doing?}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, hey, baby! Just adding the finishing touches to tonight's main course!}}
{{L|Karen|Aww, you are so sweet! I can't wait to try it! ''[Plankton kisses her screen]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Whew! Good one, Plankton. The formula! Now how am I gonna get you? ''[breeze blows as the formula rolls to the Chum Bucket.]'' Yes, yes, yes! ''[boat runs over the formula]'' No, no, no! Slow it down, you maniac! [panting] Who's that?}}
{{L|Patrick|Krabby Patty! Krabby Patty!}}
{{L|Plankton|Eesh. It's that numbskull Patrick. ''[gets a microphone]'' Hey, doofus! I mean, star friend.}}
{{L|Patrick|Krabby Patty. ''[he stops]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Over here.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hmm?}}
{{L|Plankton|No, over here! Come on. ''[Patrick finally looks at the Chum Bucket]'' Yes, that's it. You've got it. Now who's a good boy? ''[Patrick painting]'' Okay, now grab that bottle by your feet there. ''''[Patrick grabs drink container]'' No.  ''[sighs]'' The other drink container by your feet.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hmmm.}}
{{L|Plankton|Pick that one up instead.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[looks at the Krusty Krab]'' Uh?}}
{{L|Plankton|By your feet.}}
{{L|Patrick|Huh? Uh?}}
{{L|Plankton|Now look right!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, huh! ''[drops his head into the ground]''}}
{{L|Plankton|You have got to be kidding me. Right, Patrick!}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh?}}
{{L|Plankton|Your other right!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh! ''[looks at formula]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes! [laughter] That's it, huh!}}
{{L|Patrick|Ah! ''[picks up formula]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Good boy. Now bring it over here to me. Yes, that's it! Huh? ''[he notices that Patrick is gone.]'' Oh, where did he go?! ''[sees Patrick in the Chum Bucket out of nowhere]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Excuse me, are you the window cleaner?}}
{{L|Plankton|How in barnacles did you get in here?}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know?}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, who cares? Did you bring that bottle I told you to bring?}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh-huh. ''[shows Plankton drink bottle]'' Tastes kind of funny, though. ''[drinks the bottle]'' No, I said the other one, you moron! ''[looks at the window as Larry is exercising with people]''}}
{{L|Larry|Hey, you guys are doing great! ''[rolls the formula]'' Two, there, four!}}
{{L|Plankton|A thin piece of glass is all that stands between me and what I want most in the world. Why is life so unfair?}}
{{L|Karen|Oh, honey? Is dinner almost ready? I'm famished!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[he gets nervous]'' Uh, it's almost finished, my sweetheart! What am I gonna do? Think, Plankton, think! Oh? ''[Pulls off his hair]'' Idea! ''[Plankton shows his hair at Patrick]'' That's it! Karen will never know the difference! Now I think I got what I need right here. ''[grabs a saw]'' Patrick, you may feel a slight tickle.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, I like tickles. ''[Plankton saws Patrick into Ray Ray]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Okay, let's get a look at this.}}
{{L|Patrick|Ha, ha! That was intense!}}
{{L|Plankton|Oop! Almost forgot. ''[he tears off Patrick's right eye.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Ha, ha. Ow!}}
{{L|Plankton|You're going on a date with my wife Karen, Ray Ray.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, but I sound like Patrick.}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, no. You keep your mouth shut. I will take care of that. ''[he puts a microphone in his tooth]'' ''[high-pitched feedback]'' ''[chuckles]'' Oh, Karen? Dinner is served, my little love nugget!}}
{{L|Karen|Oh, my gosh. This looks amazing! I loves my Ray Ray. ''[growls and giggles]''}}
{{L|Plankton|And I love my Karen. Now let's dig in! ''[Ray Ray known as Patrick puts the spoon in his mouth and chews it.]''}}
{{L|Karen|''[giggling]'' ''[bubble translation continues to the next scene.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[lights a lighter]'' Krabby Patty secret formula, here I come! ''[cuts the lighter into the wall]''}}
{{L|Karen|Ow! That's a little rough, Ray Ray. ''[Patrick biting one of Karen's wheels]'' Ow, Plankton! What are you doing? ''[Plankton grabs Patrick's hands and has him massage Karen]'' Ohh. Oh, that feels nice. Ahh, okay. Goodnight.}}
{{L|Plankton|Whew! That was close. ''[bubble transitions to the next scene]''}}
