{{L|''[The episode starts with SpongeBob placing a pinecone of top of two other pinecones.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ladies and gentlemen, the last pinecone!}}
{{L|''[Patrick barges in with a panic.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|My candy!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob has pinecones in his two front teeth.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh? What's the matter?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[looking in his trunks]'' My candy! It's gone!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, Patrick. You can have some of my "stache".}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob finds a mustache from under his bed, and puts it on. He digs inside it.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' My "stache" is empty too!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick run out of the cabin in a panic.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Our candy's gone!}}
{{L|Camper #1|My candy is gone too!}}
{{L|Camper #2|Mine too!}}
{{L|''[Suddenly, Sandy Cheeks jumps in.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Seems our sweets have been swiped by candy rustlers. Look! Candy droppings.}}
{{L|''[Sandy picks a candy dropping up and inspects it.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Seems like we've got ourselves a woodland creature with a sweet tooth. We need something sweet for bait.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob's eyes grow, and he is highly interested.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm sweet!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob is dressed as a red candy wrapper for bait.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|If I was a hungry animal, I'd eat you all up, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aw. You're just saying that, Sandy.}}
{{L|Sandy|Just stick to the plan. We'll all be watching you from behind that kelp tree.}}
{{L|Patrick|And we'll stay up all night if we have to.}}
{{L|''[That night, Sandy, Patrick and 2 other campers are sleeping behind the kelp tree.]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob sleeps, but slowly opens his eyes to see he is getting eaten by a strange creature with red eyes. SpongeBob starts to strain, and the trap gets activated.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Help!}}
{{L|''[Everyone wakes up and runs around. Sandy and Patrick bump into each other.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|We're coming, SpongeBuddy!}}
{{L|''[Sandy shines a flashlight over SpongeBob to see what the creature is.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Help! it's eating me!}}
{{L|''[The creature is then seen with the flashlight. It shows Nobby, who is on SpongeBob's back.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Aww, it's just a little nibbler.}}
{{L|''[Nobby chews his way out of the rope, which causes him and SpongeBob to fall to the ground.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Little boy, did you eat all our candy?}}
{{L|''[Nobby speaks gibberish, making it almost impossible to understand him, and this confuses Sandy.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Uh, does anyone understand this jibber-jabber?}}
{{L|''[Suddenly, an eerie shadow appears and grabs Sandy, three other campers, and Patrick.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What? Patrick? Sandy? Oh, where is everybody?}}
{{L|''[The shadow grabs Nobby and SpongeBob flips in the air and lands straight down. SpongeBob sees the person's shadow.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mommy! I'm too young to be unwrapped!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob screams as he gets dragged out by the shadow.]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Not much later...}}
{{L|''[A light flickers on which causes SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy and all the other campers to scream. Nobby is then seen playing with two toy cars, and is crashing them together.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Leaping Lollies!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's the kid that ate our candy!}}
{{L|Patrick|Let's pump his stomach! ''[He pulls a plunger from his belly, and comes near Nobby with it.]''}}
{{L|Narlene|Stay away from him, or feel the wrath of... de-feet!}}
{{L|''[She shows her bare foot and wiggles her toes while SpongeBob and Patrick look frightened. Narlene steps into the light, revealing her true form.]''}}
{{L|Narlene|''[laughs crazily]'' I'm just bugging y'all, kids!}}
{{L|''[She then rolls on a log as she gives them all noogies, which slightly discomforts them.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[curious]'' Who are you?}}
{{L|Narlene|My name-o is Narlene Narwhal, and that hushpuppy over yonder is my bouncing bro, Nobby!}}
{{L|Nobby|Hey y'all! ''[He then uses his horn to drill into the floor, and come back again.]'' Ta-da!}}
{{L|''[He takes a bow as SpongeBob and Patrick clap for him. But, Sandy is not amused.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Now just hold on a hot Houston minute! ''[SpongeBob then stops clapping. Sandy walks over to Narlene and Nobby.]'' While it's nice to hear you're not a hungry monster, you still stole all our candy!}}
{{L|''[Narlene pushes Sandy away with her foot.]''}}
{{L|Narlene|We're not theives, y'all! We just borrow-fied your candy, so I could make a fresh batch of... Sugar Squeeze!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Sugar Squeeze?}}
{{L|''[Narlene takes a bag of candy and pours it into a funnel into her machine. She then climbs down, pulls a lever, and spins a wheel which turns the machine on. The candy is then seen being stomped on by a boot. It then goes through some test tubes. Narlene then runs to the end of the machine, and grabs a bottle of clear liquid. A golden drop of liquid drops into the bottle, turning it gold and finishing the Sugar Squeeze.]''}}
{{L|Narlene|''[melodiously]'' Sugar Squeeze! ''[normal]'' Candy wishes it was this dandy.}}
{{L|''[Patrick then takes the Sugar Squeeze and drops a small bit onto his tongue. His tongue then turns gold, and he giggles in a hyper tone.]''}}
{{L|Narlene|So, what ya think?}}
{{L|Patrick's tongue|Woo-wee! Oh, that's good Sugar Sugar Squeeze right there!}}
{{L|Narlene|Sugar Squeeze for all y'all!}}
