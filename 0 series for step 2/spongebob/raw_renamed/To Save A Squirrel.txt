{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! Sandy!}}
{{L|Sandy|What the? ''[SpongeBob and Patrick get inside Sandy's air suit. Sandy takes them out and SpongeBob and Patrick are in a muttering worry]'' Whoa there! Calm down! Now, tell me what happened.}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob and I are being chased by a savage beast!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And it's gonna eat us!}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh, no it ain't!}}
{{L|''[The little cricket in an air helmet shows up]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|''[both scream]'' There it is!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[laughs]'' This little guy? Why, he's just a harmless little cricket, he's a land creature just like me! The poor thing must have gotten lost. But he's not going to hurt ya. See? ''[SpongeBob and Patrick faint when Sandy shows them the "savage beast"]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Aahh, let's get you back home you little fella! ''[blows a bubble to the cricket]'' There you go! See, that wasn't nothing to be afraid of, huh guys?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick cry]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[sighs]'' I don't have time for this, I'm late for my survival training camp.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Survival training camp?! Patrick and I love camping!}}
{{L|Patrick|Can we come?!}}
{{L|Sandy|This is ain't no ordinary camping trip, I go out into the wild, armed only with my bare hands, my quick wits, this harpoon, and 65 pounds of dynamite ''[shows the dynamite]''. Out in the wild, it's eat or be eaten. You have to be willing to do ''anything'' when you're alone in the wild. You two wouldn't last a single day!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey!}}
{{L|Patrick|Would so!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We'll have you know that just the other day, Squidward commented at our survival skills!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[The Other Day]'' You two are harder to get rid of than cockroaches!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thank you, Squidward!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick walk away]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[starts pinning on SpongeBob and Patrick voodoo dolls]'' Why aren't these things working?! [Out of the Daydream]}}
*[Out of the Daydream]
{{L|Sandy|No way, guys! This is a serious trip for hard-core survivalists only!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|But, Sandy...!}}
{{L|Sandy|No!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Ohhh...''[Sandy drives away on her jeep, but SpongeBob and Patrick are already on it. They laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sshhh! We'll show Sandy we're tough as she is! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick have a rough shaking]'' I guess the road smoothed out. ''[The mountain Sandy is driving on is upside down, and SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming, fall from the truck, but drop in]'' That was a close one Patrick! We were almost left in the wilderness... without Sandy! And nobody would have known where to find us!}}
{{L|Patrick|Weird. There's a door back here too?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick! No! ''[SpongeBob and Patrick scream and fall out of the truck with Food Box, water bottle, and tent after Patrick opens the door]'' Sandy, wait! Sandy! Sandy! Well, at least we have food, shelter, and water. I'll pitch the tent while you start a campfire. Then when we're all settled, I'll cook us up some grub. ''[scene cuts to later]'' Okay Patrick, we're all set! We have fresh water, a rugged tent for shelter...}}
{{L|Patrick|And a nice fire to keep us warm.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, where did you get the firewood? ''[SpongeBob looks at the food box]'' You burned our food supply?! Oh-no! Quick! Quick! Put it out with something! ''[SpongeBob screams "Fire!" three times while running in circles, Patrick puts the tent over the fire]'' Hey Patrick, nice job. ''[The fire burns the tent and SpongeBob screams. SpongeBob puts the water over the water bottle and their supplies are wasted]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whew! Uh-oh, well, we burned our food, ruined our tent, and lost all our water. Patrick, we are going to need to use our [as he's poking his head] razor-sharp quick wits if we're going to make it out of here alive!}}
{{L|Patrick|Gotcha.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay. Here's the plan...}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no. You made the last decision. It's my turn.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure Patrick, what do you think we should do?}}
{{L|Patrick|Um...maybe,...uh...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob, I didn't rush you when it was your turn!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry, sorry, take your time. ''[months pass, many nights have gone, winter comes, and they become old]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Uhhh... ''[rain and thunderbolts come]'' Oh shoot! I forgot what I was going to say!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No hurry Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Do you wanna go play hide and go-seek?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure. Let's go play in that cave over there.}}
{{L|''[They go to the cave]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I like it here. It's rooooooomy, and best of all, we have this cave all to ourselves.}}
{{L|Strange Voice|Ahh, hoo-heeheeheeheeheehee.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Huh? Nice. We'll only stay here tonight, and head home tomorrow.}}
{{L|Old Cave Fish|Home? This is your new home. You'll be here forever just like me! ''[laughs. Patrick joins his laughing. ]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Aahh, good times.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What do you mean we'll be here forever? How long have you been here?}}
{{L|Fish|40 years I've been here. There's ain't no way out of this valley. You're stuck in here' with me for the rest of your lives!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We'll be here forever? We're doomed!}}
{{L|Patrick|Are you kidding? That old coot's been here for years! Look at him: he's in great shape! Look at his muscular arms, his rock-hard abs, and a great complexion, why, he's glowing with health.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You're right Patrick, but what will we eat, where will we sleep?}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know about you, but I've got all the comforts of home right here. ''[goes inside his rock home]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick's right. If I'm stuck here, I should make the best of it. I'll build myself a new home. ''[builds sand home that looks like his Pineapple Home only made out of sand and has some texture and details, but it is connected to the ground]'' There, just like my pineapple in Bikini Bottom...only, smaller, ''[grunts because he sits on the top of the sharp leaves of the sand pineapple home]'' comfy, safe and sound in my own little home.}}
{{L|Cave Fish|Safe? You're never safe out in the wild! If I were you, I'd keep an eye on that big fella.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick? ''[waves at SpongeBob]'' Do'h! Patrick is my best friend! He wouldn't hurt me.}}
{{L|Cave Fish|He's a big boy! Just wait 'til when he gets hungry! Out here, it's eat or be eaten! ''[Patrick licks and then chews on his arm]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams]'' He's got the taste of flesh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, SpongeBob. ''[his stomach growls]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sounds like you're hungry.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, boy, am I! I'm ssoooooo hungry, I could eat anything! I could eat an entire sponge...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[screams and runs away]''}}
{{L|Patrick|...cake. I was just going to share my golden sponge cake with him. It has delicious cream filling too! ''[eats the cake]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's all true! Patrick is going to eat me! What should I do?}}
{{L|Cave Fish|You've got to protect yourself! What you need is a fort!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This mud replica of the Krusty Krab should protect me from that fiend Patrick! ''[screams]'' He's onto me! Must hide! ''[hides in the sand replica of the Krusty Krab]''. Ha,ha, I'm safe, Patrick can't get me in here, ''[laughs]'', I don't need to go outside, I have everything I need right here! ''[makes tools out of sand]'' Spatula. ''[makes a sand patty]'' Now I just need some buns. ''[makes sand buns, takes a bite]'' Oh, crunchy. ''[spits the patty out]'' I can't take it! ''[blows up the sand replica of the Krusty Krab]'' I need some real food!}}
{{L|Cave Fish|Remember, kid, it's eat or be eaten.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yyyess! Yyeess! I shall eat Patrick before he eats meee! ''[SpongeBob fries Patrick's arm on a pan while Patrick is sleeping. Patrick smells the tasty aroma of his hand frying in smoke by SpongeBob's frying pan]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Something smells good. What are you cooking, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm gonna cook you up and eat ya!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[screams]'' Why do you want to eat me?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I know what you're doing, you're playing dumb, but it won't work, because I'm going to eat you before you eat me!}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, not if I eat you first!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, no you don't! ''[hurries to get Patrick]'' Where'd he go? Come on out, Patrick. You can't hide forever! What's this? ''[realizes he's in a warm boiling pot of water]'' Warm water?}}
{{L|Patrick|You seemed kinda tense, so I drew you a hot bath.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah, thanks, Patrick! I did get a trifle unhinged, didn't I?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oops, I forgot the bathbeads! ''[takes out a carrot and knife, then cuts up the carrot, which is placed into the water]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, Patrick! You're a real pal! ''[picks up a piece of the carrot]'' Funny looking bathbeads. They almost look like carrots. Carrots?! [points to Patrick] You're making soup out of me! ''[quickly hops out of the pot of water]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I was not! It was supposed to be stew! ''[runs, then becomes tired]'' Whew! I'm getting tired.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why don't you take a nap on this nice, soft bed? ''[it's a slice of white wheat bread]'' There, that's it. Here, I'll tuck you in with this nice soft blanket ''[it's another slice of white wheat bread with a toothpick and olive]'', and what's a little blanket without a little ketchup? Ne-me-me-me. [Patrick gets up and walks away]}}
{{L|Patrick|This isn't a bed!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait! Come back! You're not properly seasoned! ''[Patrick grabs the ketchup bottle and sprays ketchup all over SpongeBob. He then screams and runs away from Patrick. SpongeBob grabs back the ketchup bottle]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Give me that ketchup back!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick fight over the ketchup bottle, and cover each other with ketchup]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gotcha! ''[tries to bite Patrick]''}}
{{L|Patrick|No, got you! ''[tries to bite SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I got you! ''[tries to bite Patrick. The Cave Fish claps his hands]''}}
{{L|Cave Fish|Congratulations! You did it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Did what?}}
{{L|Patrick|What?}}
{{L|Cave Fish|Why, earned your survivalist medals, a'course! Only a hardcore survivalist would break down and nearly eat his best pal!}}
{{L|Patrick|Why do you care if we're survivalists?}}
{{L|Cave Fish|''[laughs]'' Cause I'm not just some old hermit.}}
{{L|Sandy|I'm ''[rips her costume out]'' Sandy Cheeks! Survivalist extraordinaire!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Sandy?}}
{{L|Sandy|It weren't no accident that you fell out of my truck, I was just testing your survival skills.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|You planned this?}}
{{L|Sandy|Yup. And I'm happy to say you both passed! Here's your survivalist medals! ''[gives them their medals. SpongeBob and Patrick cheer]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! It's great that we've won our medals, but I'm still hungry. ''[picks up his ketchup bottle]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Me too. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick plan to eat Sandy with ketchup]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Guys? What'cha doing? Aah, fellas?}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Eat or be eaten!}}
{{L|Sandy|Uh-oh! Next time, I'll bring more granola! ''[runs away from the cave]''}}
