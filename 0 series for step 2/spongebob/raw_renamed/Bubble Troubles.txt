{{EpisodeTranscript}}{{L|''[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting down around SpongeBob's house and the bubble jar.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|After you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah, thank you, Patrick. ''[dunks stick in a jar of bubbles, blows the bubble and it bursts]''}}
{{L|Patrick|My turn. ''[dunks stick in a jar of bubbles, blows the bubble and it bursts]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Neato. ''[the bubble pops as SpongeBob dunks the stick in a jar of bubbles]'' Watch this. ''[blows the bubble]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[bored]'' Wow. ''[SpongeBob yawns as Patrick sleeps and snores as the bubble pops and he wakes up, shouts]'' Monosodium glutamate! ''[blows another bubble, then pops]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You know, Patrick, ''[sniffs]'' we should spice up our bubble blowing.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, yeah. Spice. ''[picks up the bubble jar, close-up of it]'' No spice. Hmm... ''[throws away the bubble jar and pulls out a jar of hot sauce from his pocket, close-up of it]'' Hot sauce! ''[opens the jar with his mouth while the inside of the jar mini-explodes, then places it down]'' Spicy bubbles. ''[SpongeBob giggles as Patrick dunks the stick in the hot sauce then blows a bubble, which it flies to SpongeBob's eyes and bursts, causing the eyes to sting'']}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmm... ''[screams as his eyes disappear, then pop back out, causing him to laugh, and then he blows a bubble and does the same thing to Patrick: screaming from the sting of the bubble]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I wonder if hot sauce is bad for our eyes.}}
{{L|Both|Nah. ''[they laugh, then blow bubbles repeatedly toward their eyes that make them scream and then laugh]''}}
{{L|''[meanwhile, at Squidward's house]''}}
{{L|Squidward| ''[cuts a leaf from his bonsai portrait of himself]'' ''[sighs]'' 20 years of paint-staking care, and my bonsai portrait is almost complete. Oh! Oh, my. What's this? ''[close-up of leaf under the portrait's nose]'' I missed a spot. Not to worry. You'll be perfect soon, as perfect as me. Hmm... ''[tries to cut the leaf, but eventually, SpongeBob and Patrick keep screaming and laughing outside, causing the bonsai to rip off and land on Squidward's lap]'' ''[worried]'' Oh. Look what I've done. ''[cries]'' Oh, no!}}
{{L|Bonsai Squidward|''[comes to life]'' Squidward.}}
{{L|Squidward|What? What? Who said that?}}
{{L|Bonsai Squidward|It's me, your bonsai Squidward. Will you grant me my final request? }}
{{L|Squidward|Of..of course. ''[puts the bonsai down]'' What...what...what is it?}}
{{L|Bonsai Squidward|Avenge me.}}
{{L|Squidward|"Avenge me?" ''[ominous music plays as Squidward gets angry and looks out the window, seeing SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]'' SpongeBob!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Patrick continue to blow bubbles in there eyes before they laugh again]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I must have more.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You want more? ''[inhales and blows a big spicy bubble]''}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, you moron, you ruined my bonâ€¦ ''[notices the bubble]'' ...sai. ''[the spicy bubble explodes and burns Squidward]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Let's go to Sandy's.}}
{{L|''[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick walking to Sandy's house where Sandy fixes an air tank connected to her treedome]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sandy, Sandy, check out these new spicy bubbles that Patrick invented.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, I thinked it up with my own head. Now I'm as smart as Sandy}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Maybe even smarter.}}
{{L|Sandy|Smarter, huh? Well, I'd love to try out your new-fangled bubbles, Patrick, but I've got to fix these air lines to my treedome. They're all clogged up and the lack of fresh air is making me woozy.}}
{{L|Patrick|Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person? ''[breathes deeply a few times, then chuckles]'' Guess you're just too dumb.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I know, Sandy. I'll use these spicy bubbles. They'll clean out your pipes for you. ''[inhales, then starts blowing]''}}
{{L|Sandy|That's sweet of you, SpongeBob, but a bunch of little old bubbles ain't gonna clear these air lines. ''[SpongeBob blows the bubbles onto the air tank which starts to burn]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[gasps before seeing the water starting to flood Sandy's treedome]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oops.}}
{{L|Sandy|I'll tar and feather you nincompoops later. My suit's air supply is nearing empty. Luckily, I have just enough air in my submarine to get to the surface and refill my air tanks.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Phew! Thank goodness. Allow me to get the door. ''[opens the door, but the water comes in]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Even I knew that was dumb.}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh, no! I have only a few minutes of air left! I'm far too dizzy already. You'll have to drive, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoo! ''[cuts to the submarine whirring and pinging up to the surface]'' How's Sandy doing back there?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm not sure. Let me check. ''[an alarm beeps]'' Oh!}}
{{L|Sandy|Hey there, Patty-Pat-Pat-Pat-Patrick. Careful where you're breathing. You don't want to disturb the subatomic particle rodeo. Yee-haw, micro-dawgies! Rope them molecules.}}
{{L|Patrick|She's totally losing it.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[gasps and grunts, touching her face]'' Are there cobwebs on my face? 'Cause it feels like there's cobwebs on my face.}}
{{L|Patrick|Never mind. She seems fine.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hold on just a little longer, Sandy, we're almost there. I can see sunlight.. ''[covers his face]'' ...horrible dehydrating sunlight. ''[shivers]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Gimme that wheel, SquareButt. I know a shortcut. ''[the sub screeches around as SpongeBob and Patrick both scream]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Make sure and hold her tight, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Don't worry. She's not going anywhere.}}
{{L|Sandy|Ahh... ''[licks her helmet and smacks her lips]'' You taste like glass. ''[hiccups]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[the submarine reaches the surface]'' Blah! Fresh air. Let's hurry up and get this over with.}}
{{L|Patrick|Get what over with?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Where's Sandy?}}
{{L|Patrick|I thought she was with you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh-oh. ''[the engine revs]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Hang on, fellers! I got a hankering for a Krabby Patty ''[the sub screeches downward as SpongeBob and Patrick both scream]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sandy, what are you doing? Air is up there.}}
{{L|Sandy|Yeah, yeah. Right after I grab a quick bit at the Krusty Krab. Yee-haw.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|No! ''[the submarine crashes on the rooftop of the Krusty Krab before Sandy's gauge gets empty]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Oh, well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore. ''[takes off her helmet, which the ocean water fills, before eating a Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No Sandy, you need air, not food! ''[shoots the Krabby Patty out of Sandy's mouth with her tail]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey! What's going on out here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob| ''[as Sandy holds her breath in]'' Mr. Krabs, Sandy's run out of that crazy air stuff that she needs to breathe. We have to find some right now or she'll be headed for the last roundup.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, okay. I suppose I can't have her croaking at the Krusty Krab. That'd be bad for business. All right, let's see here. Hmm... Oxygen. O{{Sub|2}} I believe. Good old atomic number eight.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[moans angrily]''}} 
{{L|Patrick|Uh--uh-- ''[his bones crack]'' Hey, everyone. Look! There's some air bubbles trapped on the ceiling.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But how are you gonna get them down?}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Never fear. I know what to do. We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wait a minute. Those straws cost me money!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[while connecting the straws together]'' Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll put them all back.}} 
{{L|Patrick|Hurry up, SpongeBob. I'm no doctor, but I don't think squirrels are suppose to be blue.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, I'm ready.}} 
{{L|Patrick|Just a little bit further. Okay, got it.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Hurry up, Patrick. ''[Patrick starts sucking bubbles with straws]''}} 
{{L|Sandy|Hm-mmm. ''[Patrick holds a nut before Sandy sniffs it and punches Patrick]''}} 
{{L|Patrick|Looks like her color's coming back.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|That's good, but is it gonna be good enough? Mr. Krabs, you must have some spare Squidward always says you're full of hot air.}} 
{{L|Squidward|I said what?}} 
{{L|Mr. Krabs|So you think I'm full of hot air, do ye? Well, in this case, you're right. There's usually an air bubble or two trapped inside me shell. ''[to Sandy]'' Go ahead. Don't be shy. ''[Sandy grunts and puts her head on Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob starts clicking Mr. Krabs' arm back and fourth]''}} 
{{L|Pearl|Daddy, there's a submarine on the roof. Oh, you seem kind of busy. Maybe I should come back later.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|''[stops Pearl]'' No, Pearl. Don't go. You're a mammal, right?}} 
{{L|Pearl|Yeah, I guess so.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|And you breathe air, right?}} 
{{L|Pearl|Sure, my nose is full of it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You've got to help Sandy. She needs to share your air.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[whimpers while being held by SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Pearl|I guess us mammals have to stick together.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, hold still. This may pinch a little ''[places Sandy on Pearl's head]'' Okay, Pearl let 'er rip. ''[Pearl breaths and Sandy inflates]'' Now just keep breathing, Pearl. Come with me, Patrick. I have an idea that'll fix everything. ''[they go outside to the back]'' I'm gonna go up to the surface to get some air. ''[while tying a rope around his foot]'' When I tug on this rope, you pull me down.}}
{{L|Patrick|But how are you going to get up there?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll use this tank of oxygen as a makeshift rocket.}}
{{L|Patrick|An oxygen tank! Great idea, buddy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I know. Wish me luck, old friend. ''[uses a wrench and opens the oxygen tank]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[salutes]'' SquarePants, I salute you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gets to the surface before he gasps, then he opens the jar of bubble soap and pours it on his head]'' Okay, SpongeBob, it's time to catch a breath for Sandy. ''[inhales]'' So fresh it hurts. ''[squeaks and forms a huge air bubble]'' Okay, Patrick, pull me down. ''[tugs the rope with his leg]''}} 
{{L|Patrick|Hey, who did that? Hey! Oh! Ghost! ''[screams before running away]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, here we go. ''[goes underwater]''}} 
{{L|Patrick|Ah, ah! Oof! ''[starts rolling down the hill and rolls into Sandy's treedome with the big bubble]''}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|''[as Sandy wakes up]'' Welcome back, Sandy.}} 
{{L|Sandy|I'm alive? And the treedome's full of air? And sort of dry? How'd you fellers pull it off?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, you could say we had a little help from a big bubble. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick both snicker]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Hmm... In case you forgot, it was bubbles that got us into this mess in the first place. I don't want you blowing anymore bubbles around my house.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Uh-oh. ''[Sandy's house begins floating in the giant bubble]''}}
