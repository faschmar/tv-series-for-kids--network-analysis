{{L|''[Squidward has blonde hair and is playing the clarinet while the crowd is cheering for him]''}}
{{L|Tina-Fran|Squidward, we love you!}}
{{L|Audience Member #2|I love you, Squidward. You're my favorite! ''[Squidward laughs as he does a crowd surf. His alarm goes off and wakes him up]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous. ''[Plays a few notes on his clarinet]'' Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Time for another glorious day at work. ''[winks at his tie, the tie winks back]'' Good morning, Squidward! ''[walks down the street with Squidward]'' And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work?}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidwart. Hey, Sandy, what's this?}}
{{L|Sandy|Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, that sounds fancy.}}
{{L|Sandy|Let me show you how it works. ''[puts an apple in the transporter]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoa! ''[apple disappears]'' Where'd it go?}}
{{L|Sandy|Just where you think it would be. ''[apple appears on Mrs. Puff's desk]''}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab?}}
{{L|Sandy|I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoo-hoo! ''[goes into transporter]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Hold on tight.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[transporter starts]'' Gee, Sandy, this sure feels...}}
{{L|Squidward|''[walking up to the Krusty Krab]'' Well, here we go again. ''[as he reaches for the door, SpongeBob appears and Squidward's arm is attached through SpongeBob's body]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Squidward! ''[laughs. Sandy's remote is going haywire]''}}
{{L|Sandy|What's going on with this thing? ''[SpongeBob and Squidward get transported back to Sandy's machine]'' What in tarnation? ''[gasps. SpongeBob and Squidward are mutated into one body]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, Sandy!}}
{{L|Squidward|I'm not sure what it is, but something seems different about me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah, me too.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hey, what are you doing with my hand? What am I doing with your hand? Ahh! What is this? We're all mixed up together. ''[tries to detach himself, but fails]'' This is horrible! I have my clarinet recital tomorrow!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[screams]'' Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated!}}
{{L|Sandy|Well, I wish I knew how.}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, you have to do something! I can't stay stuck to ''him''!}}
{{L|Sandy|Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if I tried zapping you back in the transporter.}}
{{L|Squidward|Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it.}}
{{L|Sandy|Well, here goes nothing. ''[transports to Bikini Bottom Elementary]''}}
{{L|Mable|All right, children. Today's Timmy's birthday. You know what that means. Ready, Timmy? ''[opens present. SpongeBob and Squidward rise up from the box, still mutated together. Mable screams as SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again]''}}
{{L|Doctor|Congratulations, Mrs. Smith. You gave birth to a healthy baby boy.}}
{{L|Mrs. Smith|May I see my baby?}}
{{L|Doctor|Of course. ''[baby appears as SpongeBob & Squidward mutated into one body again. Mrs. Smith screams as they are transported again]''}}
{{L|One-Eyed Monster|I've been in love with you ever since I first laid my eye on you. ''[both monsters kiss. SpongeBob and Squidward appear between them]'' Hey, baby, what's your name? ''[SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again. The lady monster slaps the one-eyed monster's face and leaves]''}}
{{L|Squidward|It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same.}}
{{L|Sandy|Well, that's a darn shame. You know what, I was working on the blueprints for a new invention. But it's still in the embryonic stage.}}
{{L|Squidward|Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this.}}
{{L|Sandy|I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Together forever.}}
{{L|Squidward|Misery. ''[later, SpongeBob and Squidward are riding a bike to work]'' SpongeBob, hasn't anyone taught you how to ride a bike?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Don't worry, I'll drive.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Squidward's head bumps against the wheel of the bike]'' Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. ''[both enter the Krusty Krab riding the bike. The bike crashes into the boat and they fly through the kitchen window]''}}
{{L|Customer #1|I gotta lay off the hot sauce.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[enters kitchen]'' What in blazes is going on in here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|What are you two doing laying around? Get to work.}}
{{L|Squidward|If you say so. ''[as they stand up, Mr. Krabs freaks out]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Egad! What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye aye, cap'n!}}
{{L|Squidward|Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon.}}
{{L|Squidward|I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register. ''[stretches his head through the kitchen window]'' Whew. Can I help you?}}
{{L|Customer #2|Can I get two Krabby Patties, please?}}
{{L|Squidward|SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Two Krabby Patties coming right up. ''[notices the buns are out of reach]'' I can't... reach the buns.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, what's the holdup?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Time is money, boy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Time is money. Right. ''[reaches bun]'' Hello, bun. At last we meet. ''[Squidward can't hold the cash register. His head flies through the kitchen window, onto the grill and crashes into SpongeBob]'' And now for the-}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth. ''[pushes them out the restaurant]'' And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other.}}
{{L|Squidward|That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile! Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace. ''[plays clarinet as they walk past a surfer]''}}
{{L|Surfer|Whoa, rock on, freaky bro!}}
{{L|Squidward|Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us.}}
{{L|Sandy|Say hello to the 'Molecular Separator Ray'.}}
{{L|Squidward|Hello, Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night.}}
{{L|Sandy|Uhh, well, I'm not quite done with it yet.}}
{{L|Squidward|What'd you say?}}
{{L|Sandy|I'm still putting it together. At best I'll have it ready, uhh, the day after tomorrow? Maybe? [Squidward pushes Sandy's air helmet]}}
{{L|Squidward|What?!? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak! ''[SpongeBob smiles]'' Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show!}}
{{L|Sandy|Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on. ''[Squidward and SpongeBob stretch through their front doors, but can't walk much further, so their houses collide together]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Of course. ''[at the clarinet recital]'' Oh, my. ''[not an empty seat in the house]'' Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar!}}
{{L|Squidward|Superstar?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen!}}
{{L|Squidward|You're right! The show must go on!}}
{{L|Announcer|Ladies and gentlefish, Bikini Bottom's Community Rec Center is proud to present: Squidward Tentacles. ''[curtain rises to Squidward wearing a big cape like clothing. Squidward starts playing and everyone begins to hate it]''}}
{{L|Evelyn|Honey, I'm scared. ''[the crowd continues to dislike Squidward playing the clarinet, the cape comes off as a nail tears it. SpongeBob starts to see the crowd, the crowd gasps]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uhh, hi.}}
{{L|Wobbles|Whoa. Rock on, freaky bro! Yeah. Whoo! ''[crowd cheers]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, they really liked it.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[laughing]'' There you go, Squiddy!}}
{{L|Squidward|They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it [starts to laugh happily] sounds like. And... ''[smells the air]'' ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating.}}
{{L|Sandy|Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Squidward|Sandy?}}
{{L|Sandy|One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good. ''[SpongeBob and Squidward try to tell Sandy not to blast them, but was too late, she blasts the ray at Squidward and SpongeBob and it separates them. Crowd gasps]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[SpongeBob gives him back his clarinet]'' Hmph. ''[plays clarinet off-key making SpongeBob cheer for him, but the audience hates it as they block their ears, Old Man Jenkins faints off his chair]''}}
{{L|Mary|I think I'm going to be sick! ''[Squidward blows his clarinet at Billy, which blows his skin off and shows his skeleton]''}}
{{L|Billy|Ah, I'm out of here!}}
{{L|Squidward|Huh, no, wait. Wait! ''[everyone leaves]'' Oh, my one moment of fame... gone. ''[grabs the Molecular Separator Ray]'' There's got to be some way to reverse this. ''[pushes the button over and over]''}}
{{L|Sandy|No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, I wouldn't--! ''[laser blasts into the final scene]''}}
{{L|Therapist|So, what seems to be the problem, Mr. Tentacles?}}
{{L|Squidward|It all started when I was born. ''[camera zooms out to show Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Pearl, SpongeBob, and Squidward deformed and misshapen into a liquid ball of the fused characters]''}}
