{{L|Patchy the Pirate|Oh. Bye, Mom. Thanks for the lift. ''[The car drives off, leaving smoke behind. Patchy coughs a bit.]'' Hey, kids. Isn't this exciting?

He returns to the ground.]''}}
{{L|Patchy|Woo! Oh, hey, when'll SpongeBob be here? Where's he? At lunch? At an important meeting?}}
{{L|Security Guard|I'm not sure, sir.}}

{{L|Patchy|Yeah. A shrimp cocktail. ''[Patchy chuckles. The security guard puts his hand out and then back in with a shrimp cocktail. He gives it to Patchy.]'' Ooh! Now, that's what I call service... ''[The security guard smiles.]'' with a smile! ''[he smiles]''}}

{{L|Gary|''[Angrily]'' Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A little overboard? And take a chance at being late for the single most greatest day of my career. ''[The shot widens and a thought bubble appears.

{{L|''[The scene returns to SpongeBob's room. He is yelling out of his window.]'' See you at the big event, Squidward! ''[SpongeBob gets hit with an alarm clock. This causes him to fly and land next to Gary. SpongeBob gets up.]'' Can you believe that it's been eleventy-seven years already?}}
{{L|Gary|''[Snidely]'' Meow, meow, meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, watch the potty mouth, Gare. Today is a day for gentle reflection. Aw, I remember my first visit to the Krusty Krab.}}

{{L|Harold SquarePants|I don't know. This doesn't seem like a family restaurant.}}

{{L|''[SpongeBob runs off-screen and Gary hisses at the alarm clock. The alarm clock "runs" away. The scene changes to show SpongeBob with a towel around his waist in the bathroom. He turns on the shower and takes the towel off. The scene shows SpongeBob showering]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Singing voice-over]''|♪ I never thought that I would have a chance like this. What dreams exist as big as this one? ''[SpongeBob turns the water off. SpongeBob grows big. The tub falls to its side and SpongeBob uses his wringer.]'' If happiness are patties frying on a grill, ''[SpongeBob makes a flat SpongeBob that goes through a slot. The scene changes to show a room with SpongeBob's pants on two wires.]'' I'll have my fill upon each fresh bun. ''[The flat SpongeBob lands and folds on top of SpongeBob's pants. He takes his hairdryer and puts it in one of his holes. He blows himself up.]'' Here's a day that couldn't get much better. ''[SpongeBob's legs go through the leg holes.]'' It is the greatest that's ever been. ''[SpongeBob runs into another room with a set of drawers. He opens the top one. It is filled with cans. He takes one. It reads, "Sock."]'' It's so cool, I ought to where a sweater ''[SpongeBob drinks the can.]'' just to hold on to that warm feelin'. ''[Socks start to form one top of SpongeBob's feet.]'' A miracle is something that you don't believe ''[SpongeBob runs into his library were there is a pile of shoes. While running, he picks up two and continues to run.]'' you will receive, and then it happens. ''[SpongeBob ends up in his bathroom. He takes off his face and opens a cabinet of faces where he finds and puts on an exited face.]'' This is what I have to call a miracle. My heart is full and toes are tappin'. ''[The scene moves into SpongeBob's mouth.]'' Here's a day that couldn't get much better. ''[SpongeBob is shown running on a round surface at night. It is revealed that the surface is the bun of a Krabby Patty, which is on a cloud. It moves upwards.]'' It is the greatest that's ever been. ''[The Krabby Patty stops and SpongeBob dives off.]'' It's so cool, I ought to where a sweater just to hold on to that warm feelin'. ''[SpongeBob lands on a patty that is on his grill.]'' Sure, I know it's gonna take a lot of work, ''[A spatula takes SpongeBob and it is revealed that SpongeBob is putting the patty on the other patty makings.]'' but here's the perk, ''[SpongeBob eats the patty and it falls into a flowery background]'' I think I must say, ''[The Krabby Patty decomposes into its part and the SpongeBob that landed on the patty falls out.]'' when you're doing something that you really love ''[The scene changes to show spatula flying through the air. SpongeBob lands on one. SpongeBob starts dancing.]'' and so proud of, then work is like play. ''[SpongeBob then controls the spatula.]'' Here's a day that couldn't get much better. It is the greatest that's ever been. ''[The spatula flings SpongeBob and he lands on an ice cube in a cup of soda.]''It's so cool, I ought to where a sweater ''[A purple sweater falls on SpongeBob]'' just to hold on to that warm feelin'. ♪}}

{{L|Devil Potty|Look, Patchy, a Rolodex. Why, it's probably full of celebrity phone numbers. You don't need SpongeBob. You can call them yourself. Go on, have a look. Squawk.}}
{{L|''[Patchy leans into it. Another figure that looks like Potty, but this time with a halo and angel wings appears.]''}}
{{L|Angel Potty|That's private property, Patchy. If you get caught looking at it, we'll never get to meet SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Patchy|Yeah, good point.}}
{{L|Devil Potty|Don't listen to him. You want your TV show to have big-name guests, don't you?}}
{{L|Patchy|Yeah. No. I mean...}}
{{L|Devil Potty|Then do it.}}
{{L|Angel Potty|Don't do it, Patchy.}}

{{L|''[A flashback starts. Mrs. Puff is shown playing the organ. Sandy is shown in a wedding dress. She starts to walk down the aisle.

Sandy finishes walking down the aisle.]''}}
{{L|Wedding officiant|Friends, we have gathered here today to join these two hearts ''[The crowd is shown]'' in the bonds of love. ''[Plankton is shown. He looks up.

{{L|SpongeBob|I do.}}
{{L|Wedding officiant|And Sandy, do you take SpongeBob as your lawfully wedded husband?}}
{{L|Sandy|And how!}}
{{L|Wedding officiant|Well then, I now pronounce you sponge and squirrel. You may kiss the bride.}}
{{L|''[The wedding officiant walks away backwards. SpongeBob sprays breath spray into his mouth.  He straightens his bow tie. SpongeBob and Sandy lean in and SpongeBob kisses Sandy's helmet.

{{L|Mr. Krabs|Worst play I've ever seen. ''[The scene changes to shows part of the exterior of the Recreation Center. There is a sign that reads, "Tonight" and below that "The Marriage of SpongeBob" and below that there is an image of SpongeBob's head with a bow tie. The audience starts to leave.]'' And a total rip-off!}}

{{L|''[The scene changes to black and then shows Patchy inside the whale. He has a fire. There is also a projector and some old film next to him. Patchy sighs deeply.]''}}
{{L|Patchy|Well kids, this was supposed to be the part of the show where SpongeBob and I were gonna watch old outtakes ''[He takes out a film reel.]'' and rejected scenes and talk about 'em. ''[He starts crying and drops the film reel.]'' But he never showed up! And now I'm stuck in the belly of a whale! Oh well, We already paid for the airtime, so...here they are. ''[He starts the projector. A title card appears that reads, "Patchy the Pirate's World of Rare and Rejected SpongeBob Clips". Patchy then appears on the film next to an image of SpongeBob on an easel on a red curtain background.]'' Hello, children. You know, like any great work of art, SpongeBob didn't just appear out of nowhere. He started out as a thought. ''[A drawing of a man with SpongeBob in his head is shown.]'' Then he evolved into ''[A painting of a caveman drawing SpongeBob in the sand in a dark cave appears.]'' a primitive rendering. And along the way, ''[Patchy is shown again.]'' to becoming the sponge we all know and love, ''[Images of realistic SpongeBob and other characters appear on paper briefly, floating down.]'' he went through many different changes... ''[Patchy is shown again.]'' and phases...and phanges. ''[A painting that mimics the evolution of man image is shown. It uses SpongeBob looking-creatures instead of human ancestors.]'' And change can be very painful. For instance, ''[Patchy is shown again.]'' did you know that SpongeBob was not the first choice to star in the show? ''[gasps]'' Hard to believe, I know. Watch these opening themes, and you'll see why he was eventually picked.}}
