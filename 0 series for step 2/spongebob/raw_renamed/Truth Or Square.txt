''[The clip is replaced with a clip of Patchy holding up a SpongeBob cookie when he was talking about if Squidward was right about Christmas in "Christmas Who?"]'' It's 10 years ago. ''[The clip is replaced with a clip of Patchy seeing the stick of dynamite and it going off from "Party Pooper Pants".]'' Let's see what happens, yeah.}} ''[The clip shows Patchy burned after the explosion in "Shanghaied".]''
{{L|''[The screen fades to black. The scene opens up to the front of Nickelodeon Animation Studios, where [[Patchy's Mom]]'s car is pulling up. The scene changes to show the left of the car. Patchy gets out.]''}}
{{L|Patchy the Pirate|Oh. Bye, Mom. Thanks for the lift. ''[The car drives off, leaving smoke behind. Patchy coughs a bit.]'' Hey, kids. Isn't this exciting? I'm here at Nickelodeon, home of SpongeBob SquarePants, and I'm gonna ask him if he'll be my guest of honor on my tenth fan-iversary TV special! ''[Patchy chuckles. An image of the special's title appears. It reads, "Patchy the Pirate's SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club Big Time Celebratory Television Extravaganza!"

He walks to the gate. The scene shifts to show a speaker communicator. Patchy's hook is shown pressing it]'' Ahoy.}}
{{L|''[The scene shifts to show Patchy hunched over next to the speaker.]''}}
{{L|Security Guard|''[through the speaker]'' Sir, may I help you?}}
{{L|Patchy|Yes. This is Patchy the Pirate for SpongeBob SquarePants. I believe he's expecting me. I sent him over 400 letters...this week.}}
{{L|Security Guard|Uh, yes. SpongeBob is not here right now, sir.}}
{{L|Patchy|That's okay. I can wait. ''[Patchy takes out a lawn chair and sits down. The down to the gate opens and this startles Patchy.]'' Oh, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|Security Guard|Sir, please step away from the gate.}}
{{L|Patchy|Aw, poopdeck. I was hoping I could ask SpongeBob to phone up some of his famous friends so he could ask them to be guests on my show.}}
{{L|Security Guard|Uh-huh. ''[The security guard starts to leave, but then realizes who Patchy is.]'' Oh. You're here for the Casting Department.}}
{{L|Patchy|Yeah.}}
{{L|Security Guard|In that case, please step right inside, sir.}}
{{L|''[Patchy thrusts his arm and mouths the word, "yes". Patchy follows the security guard inside. Inside, Patchy and the security guard walk down a hallway where a cardboard cutout of SpongeBob and a model of SpongeBob made out of Lego bricks are seen. Patchy jumps up in the air and laughs. He returns to the ground.]''}}
{{L|Patchy|Woo! Oh, hey, when'll SpongeBob be here? Where's he? At lunch? At an important meeting?}}
{{L|Security Guard|I'm not sure, sir.}}
{{L|Patchy|Getting his boat waxed?}}
{{L|Security Guard|''[Pointing ahead]'' This way, sir.}}
{{L|''[The two continue to walk]''}}
{{L|Patchy|What's he really like?}}
{{L|Security Guard|''[Pointing ahead]'' This way, sir.}}
{{L|Patchy|Does he come in everyday?}}
{{L|Security Guard|''[Pointing ahead]'' Go this way.}}
{{L|Patchy|Does he dye his hair?}}
{{L|Security Guard|''[Pointing ahead]'' Walk this way, sir.}}
{{L|Patchy|Huh?}}
{{L|''[The scene shifts to show a room. It has a couch, a TV, a poster for ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'', and an animation cell of SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab. The security guard opens the door. Patchy walks in.]''}}
{{L|Security Guard|Here you are, sir. Please wait here while you wait. ''[Patchy sits down on the couch.]'' Can I get you anything, sir?}}
{{L|Patchy|Yeah. A shrimp cocktail. ''[Patchy chuckles. The security guard puts his hand out and then back in with a shrimp cocktail. He gives it to Patchy.]'' Ooh! Now, that's what I call service... ''[The security guard smiles.]'' with a smile! ''[he smiles]''}}
{{L|''[The security guard leaves. The SpongeBob part of the episode begins with the title card. The episode begins showing the three houses of Conch Street at night. The scene transitions to morning. The scene changes to SpongeBob's room, where Gary's shell shaking with a blanket on top of it. Next to the shell is an traditional alarm clock.]''}}
{{L|Gary|''[In his shell]'' Meow. ''[The alarm clock goes off.]'' Meow. ''[Gary's head pops out of his shell.]'' Meow.}} 
{{L|''[A long line of alarm clocks go off, which leads from Gary, who is in the front of the bed to SpongeBob's normal alarm clock. It goes off and spits out more alarm clocks. SpongeBob wakes up. SpongeBob gets out of bed and turns the alarm clocks off.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good morning, Gary!}}
{{L|Gary|''[Angrily]'' Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A little overboard? And take a chance at being late for the single most greatest day of my career. ''[The shot widens and a thought bubble appears. It shows the Krusty Krab.]'' The eleventy-seventh anniversary of the Krusty Krab. ''[SpongeBob leans near Gary and shakes his head.]'' Oh, oh, oh, I think not. ''[He returns to his previous position.]'' No self-respecting Krusty Krab employee would be late on this day.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to show the exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple, where SpongeBob's door open and a line of alarm clocks are leading to the inside of Squidward's house. The scene follows the alarm clocks to Squidward's door and then moves up. Squidward is heard muttering.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[Off-Screen]'' What the?}}
{{L|''[The scene returns to SpongeBob's room. He is yelling out of his window.]'' See you at the big event, Squidward! ''[SpongeBob gets hit with an alarm clock. This causes him to fly and land next to Gary. SpongeBob gets up.]'' Can you believe that it's been eleventy-seven years already?}}
{{L|Gary|''[Snidely]'' Meow, meow, meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, watch the potty mouth, Gare. Today is a day for gentle reflection. Aw, I remember my first visit to the Krusty Krab.}}
{{L|''[A flashback begins. It shows the exterior of the Krusty Krab. Harold and Margaret SquarePants are walking to it. The scene shifts to show Harold and Margaret's front.]''}}
{{L|Harold SquarePants|I don't know. This doesn't seem like a family restaurant.}}
{{L|Margaret SquarePants|Oh. ''[The scene widens to reveal that she is pregnant with SpongeBob]'' Well, what do you think, baby? Should we eat here? ''[The scene moves to show the inside of Margaret's womb. SpongeBob swims off-screen. The scene returns to show Margaret. She is moved inside to the front of the cash register boat.]'' Well, okay, then. ''[The scene returns to the womb and SpongeBob is next to Margaret's belly button which looks like a window. Margaret's voice is echoing.]'' What would you like?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob looks out Margaret's belly button and sees the Galley Grub]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Krabby Patty! ''[The scene changes to show Margaret and Harold sitting at a table eating Krabby Patties. In the womb, SpongeBob is eating the Krabby Patties through the umbilical cord.]'' Yummy! ''[He takes the cord, rips it out, and sucks on the cord. The flashback ends and SpongeBob is shown laying on the ground being held up by his elbows.]'' Good times. ''[An alarm clock appears. SpongeBob jumps up and starts running in the air.]'' Oh, sorry, Gary, we can reminisce later. I gotta get ready.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob runs off-screen and Gary hisses at the alarm clock. The alarm clock "runs" away. The scene changes to show SpongeBob with a towel around his waist in the bathroom. He turns on the shower and takes the towel off. The scene shows SpongeBob showering]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Singing voice-over]''|â™ª I never thought that I would have a chance like this. What dreams exist as big as this one? ''[SpongeBob turns the water off. SpongeBob grows big. The tub falls to its side and SpongeBob uses his wringer.]'' If happiness are patties frying on a grill, ''[SpongeBob makes a flat SpongeBob that goes through a slot. The scene changes to show a room with SpongeBob's pants on two wires.]'' I'll have my fill upon each fresh bun. ''[The flat SpongeBob lands and folds on top of SpongeBob's pants. He takes his hairdryer and puts it in one of his holes. He blows himself up.]'' Here's a day that couldn't get much better. ''[SpongeBob's legs go through the leg holes.]'' It is the greatest that's ever been. ''[SpongeBob runs into another room with a set of drawers. He opens the top one. It is filled with cans. He takes one. It reads, "Sock."]'' It's so cool, I ought to where a sweater ''[SpongeBob drinks the can.]'' just to hold on to that warm feelin'. ''[Socks start to form one top of SpongeBob's feet.]'' A miracle is something that you don't believe ''[SpongeBob runs into his library were there is a pile of shoes. While running, he picks up two and continues to run.]'' you will receive, and then it happens. ''[SpongeBob ends up in his bathroom. He takes off his face and opens a cabinet of faces where he finds and puts on an exited face.]'' This is what I have to call a miracle. My heart is full and toes are tappin'. ''[The scene moves into SpongeBob's mouth.]'' Here's a day that couldn't get much better. ''[SpongeBob is shown running on a round surface at night. It is revealed that the surface is the bun of a Krabby Patty, which is on a cloud. It moves upwards.]'' It is the greatest that's ever been. ''[The Krabby Patty stops and SpongeBob dives off.]'' It's so cool, I ought to where a sweater just to hold on to that warm feelin'. ''[SpongeBob lands on a patty that is on his grill.]'' Sure, I know it's gonna take a lot of work, ''[A spatula takes SpongeBob and it is revealed that SpongeBob is putting the patty on the other patty makings.]'' but here's the perk, ''[SpongeBob eats the patty and it falls into a flowery background]'' I think I must say, ''[The Krabby Patty decomposes into its part and the SpongeBob that landed on the patty falls out.]'' when you're doing something that you really love ''[The scene changes to show spatula flying through the air. SpongeBob lands on one. SpongeBob starts dancing.]'' and so proud of, then work is like play. ''[SpongeBob then controls the spatula.]'' Here's a day that couldn't get much better. It is the greatest that's ever been. ''[The spatula flings SpongeBob and he lands on an ice cube in a cup of soda.]''It's so cool, I ought to where a sweater ''[A purple sweater falls on SpongeBob]'' just to hold on to that warm feelin'. â™ª}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob melts through the ice cube. He falls into the soda. He gets sucked up by a straw, which is being sucked up by SpongeBob. SpongeBob then jumps away.

{{L|Patchy|Security, more shrimp cocktail in casting, please. Thank you.}} 
{{L|''[He throws away the end of the last shrimp piece on the tray. A figure that looks like Potty, but with a devil tail and horns appears.]''}}
{{L|Devil Potty|Look, Patchy, a Rolodex. Why, it's probably full of celebrity phone numbers. You don't need SpongeBob. You can call them yourself. Go on, have a look. Squawk.}}
{{L|''[Patchy leans into it. Another figure that looks like Potty, but this time with a halo and angel wings appears.]''}}
{{L|Angel Potty|That's private property, Patchy. If you get caught looking at it, we'll never get to meet SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Patchy|Yeah, good point.}}
{{L|Devil Potty|Don't listen to him. You want your TV show to have big-name guests, don't you?}}
{{L|Patchy|Yeah. No. I mean...}}
{{L|Devil Potty|Then do it.}}
{{L|Angel Potty|Don't do it, Patchy.}}
{{L|Devil Potty|Come on. Do it! Do it!}}
{{L|Patchy|I shall. ''[He takes the Rolodex. The Potties leave.]'' Let's see, Dawson, Richard. Rosario. Rosario Dawson! She'll bring a little class to the show.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to show Rosario Dawson in her home looking at a magazine. She gets a phone call.]''}}

{{L|''[The scene returns to Rosario.]''}}
{{L|Rosario Dawson|Okay. You need a little mouthwash is what you need.}}
{{L|''[The scene returns to Patchy.]''}}
{{L|Patchy|I was wondering if you'd like to be my special guest.}}
{{L|''[The scene returns to Rosario. She groans.]''}}
{{L|Rosario Dawson|Are you going to be in the same city?}}
{{L|''[The scene returns to Patchy.]''}}
{{L|Patchy|Of course, silly. We'll be working closely together ALL day.}}

{{L|''[The scene shows Patchy confused. The scene returns to the door. The security guard comes in.]''}}
{{L|Security Guard|This way, sir.}}

{{L|Triumph|I'm Busy. Hurry up.}}
{{L|Patchy|This is Patchy the Pirate.}}
{{L|Triumph|Oh. Don't give me that Patchy stuff. Come on, Depp, I know it's you. Drop the pirate thing.}}
{{L|Patchy|You know, I do get that a lot, but seriously, it's not Johnny Depp.}}
{{L|Triumph|Come on. Who is this? The pirate from the cereal box or the litter box?}}
{{L|Patchy|The one from Encino! It's Patchy, president of ''the'' SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club.}}
{{L|Triumph|Ooh, the president! Well, your mother must be so proud.}}
{{L|''[The scene returns to Patchy. He looks disgusted.]''}}
{{L|Triumph|Listen, Scratchy.}}
{{L|Patchy|It's Patchy.}}
{{L|Triumph|You know, Catchy, maybe you should consider wearing two eye patches. That way, you won't be able to see what's become of your life.}}
{{L|Patchy|What?!}}
{{L|Triumph|So, what are you tell me, what are you selling, besides your dignity and self-respect?}}
{{L|Patchy|None of the above. I was wondering if you'd like to be a guest on the big TV special. That I am throwing for SpongeBob.}}

{{L|Patchy|Well kids, this was supposed to be the part of the show where SpongeBob and I were gonna watch old outtakes ''[He takes out a film reel.]'' and rejected scenes and talk about 'em. ''[He starts crying and drops the film reel.]'' But he never showed up! And now I'm stuck in the belly of a whale! Oh well, We already paid for the airtime, so...here they are. ''[He starts the projector. A title card appears that reads, "Patchy the Pirate's World of Rare and Rejected SpongeBob Clips". Patchy then appears on the film next to an image of SpongeBob on an easel on a red curtain background.]'' Hello, children. You know, like any great work of art, SpongeBob didn't just appear out of nowhere. He started out as a thought. ''[A drawing of a man with SpongeBob in his head is shown.]'' Then he evolved into ''[A painting of a caveman drawing SpongeBob in the sand in a dark cave appears.]'' a primitive rendering. And along the way, ''[Patchy is shown again.]'' to becoming the sponge we all know and love, ''[Images of realistic SpongeBob and other characters appear on paper briefly, floating down.]'' he went through many different changes... ''[Patchy is shown again.]'' and phases...and phanges. ''[A painting that mimics the evolution of man image is shown. It uses SpongeBob looking-creatures instead of human ancestors.]'' And change can be very painful. For instance, ''[Patchy is shown again.]'' did you know that SpongeBob was not the first choice to star in the show? ''[gasps]'' Hard to believe, I know. Watch these opening themes, and you'll see why he was eventually picked.}}

{{L|Ricky Gervais|Wow, Patchy sure made a mess of things, didn't he? He's not much of a pirate either, really, come to think of it. ''[A canon shot is shown.]'' That's the problem. ''[A drawing of Blackbeard is shown.]'' Not like Blackbeard. Whoa, now there was a pirate. ''[Footage of a Jolly Roger is shown.]'' Now Blackbeard ''[Footage of a ship shooting another ship is shown.]'' would have been able to get the real A-listers ''[Footage of pirates fighting is shown]'' on his TV special.

''[Footage of a pirate balloon in a parade is shown.]'' Patchy's kinda ''[Footage of a sailor dancing around is shown]'' giving pirates a bad name, really, ''[Footage of a kid dressed like a pirate is shown.]'' if I'm being brutally honest. ''[Footage of a kid picking up gummy bears and putting them in his shirt pocket is shown.]'' Oh well, thanks for watching, kiddies. [[SpongeBob's Big Birthday Blowout|And we'll see you at the 20th anniversary]]. ''[Footage of a person flipping over an hour glass is shown.]'' That's 10 years from now. Starting now.
