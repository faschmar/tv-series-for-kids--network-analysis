{{L|French Narrator|Let us join SpongeBob. Look out, SpongeBob! What is this? He has uncovered something.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! Mr. Krabs will know what this is! Mr. Krabs, I found a statue...}} 
{{L|Mr. Krabs|By great neptune's beard! That statue marks the entrance to the Dutchman's underworld! A long time ago, in the city of Palm Bay there was the master fry cook who ruled with the golden spatula. But, Mt. Kabloovious buried Palm Bay starting the grease fires that ended the greasy civilization. As legend has it, the Flying Dutchman took over the cities ruins and his first mate buried the key to the city somewhere in the Goo Lagoon. Find that key boy. If you get the golden spatula, I'll be rich... Uh, I mean you would be a master fry cook. Now, you'd better go home and get your things!}}
