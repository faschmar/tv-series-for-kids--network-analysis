This article is the transcript of the video game, ''[[Battle for Bikini Bottom]]'', which was released on {{Time|October 31}}, {{Time|2003}}.

===Bikini Bottom (first area)===
{{L|French Narrator|Welcome to Bikini Bottom. A normally peaceful undersea sanctuary. Today it will be transformed into a theater of pure horror, wherein our little yellow friend will play the starring role.}}
{{L|''(Zooms out to show the Chum Bucket, then the inside to show Plankton next to a machine)''}}
{{L|Plankton|Today's the big day. I have devised an ingenious plan to finally steal the Krabby Patty formula. And if Bikini Bottom happens to get demolished in the process, oh well. Hehehehe! With my brand new Duplicatotron 3000, I'll clone an army of robots that will wreak mayhem and destruction at my command. One last review of the checklist. Let's see... Item number one: is Plankton a genius? Answer: yes. Okay, checklist complete. Throwin' the switch![on-screen text states "throw on" instead of "throwin'"] ''(turns on the Duplicatotron 3000 and Fodder robots come out)'' Welcome, my perfectly obedient robot army! Hang on, I want to get a photo for my scrapebook... ''(Notices the Fodders surrounding him)'' Hey. Hello? What do you think your doing? ''(Sees that he forgot to switch the Duplicatotron 3000 to "Obey Plankton" as the Fodders carry him off)'' Oh, no. No, no, wait. Wait! But I'm your master! I made you!!! No! No! Oh! My good china!!! ''(The Fodders kick him out of the Chum Bucket)'' Arggghh!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Another perfect day playing robots and racehorses.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, only I keep getting the racehorses and the robots mixed up.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wouldn't be great if we had real robots to play with Patrick? I'd name mine Robo Junior. Or Zorlon, or maybe Frankie.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, these unreal robots are getting boring, hey, what if we put the robots in here?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh how shell-fish of you.}}
{{L|Patrick|It's not just any shell, it's my magic wishing shell.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! That's great Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|So, we put they toy robots in here.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay.}}
{{L|Patrick|Then we say the magic wishing words. And shake the magic wishing shell.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay.}}
{{L|Patrick|Then we go to sleep, and in the morning, we'll have real robots to play with.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But Patrick, aren't we going to say the magic wishing words?}}
{{L|Patrick|You already did.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So "okay" is the magic wishing word?}}
{{L|Patrick|It used to be Alakazama-ala-balo-weesnaw-dinky-tana-fooshbarg-griddlebits-von-wiener-schnauzer. But I kept forgetting it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you sure this'll work?}}
{{L|Patrick|Sure. Last week, i only had one big cookie crumb, and I was really hungry, so I put my cookie crumb in the magic wishing shell. Then I said the magic wishing word and shook it, and in the morning I had lots of little cookie crumbs.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick. I proclaim that tomorrow is going to be the best day ever.}}
{{L|Patrick|Goodnight SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Goodnight Patrick.}}
{{L|''(A [[Fodder]] is shown outside of SpongeBob's house)''}}
{{L|French Narrator|The next morning.}}
{{L|''(The alarm goes off and SpongeBob awakens and gets out of bed.)''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gonna play with robots, gonna play with robots, gonna play with robots, gonna play with- Whoa! Uh Gary, did you do that?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah Gary, it sure looks like we're in a doozy of a pickle. I think I'm gonna have to learn a lot in order to fix this mess.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What a fantastic idea, these signs will provide important tips to help me out.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um, how do I read the signs?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh. Ok. Press this button to read the signs.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So if I want to come back and talk to you again, just walk up to you and press this button, I better get started now Gary, I think that this is going to be a very long day. }}
{{L|Johnny|Breaking news, Bikini Bottom residents have been attacked by a raging torrent of robot horror.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So much for fixing this quietly.}}
{{L|Johnny|Authorities are not sure the who is responsible for unleashing the mechanical menaces, but they have assured us that the person is in big-big trouble.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh-oh.}}
{{L|Johnny|Did I say big trouble? I meant so enormous that it's hard to comprehend trouble, we'll keep you posted as this tragic story unfolds. Tragically, we're sure.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A note from Mr. Krabs. And it even smells sweaty just like him.}}
{{L|Mr Krabs|Ahoy there SpongeBob, as the faithful crew member of the Krusty Krab, you've been, err... promoted to head for any object collector.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! A promotion!}}
{{L|Mr Krabs|That's right a promotion, so what this here new job entails, is you collecting all these shiny objects that the robots are leaving behind and bringing them to me, now stop sea-horsing around and get busy collecting.}}
{{L|French Narrator|Ah, there's nothing like the sounds of your own neighborhood.}}
{{L|Plankton|Go away SpongeBob, you're polluting my thinking space.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula again, eh Plankton? Well you won't get away with it.}}
{{L|Plankton|I've got bigger fish to fry, i've got to figure out how to regain control of the Chum Bucket from those robots.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Where did they come from?}}
{{L|Plankton|Where? Umm... I don't know. Not from me, though. That's for sure. They just showed up out of nowhere and started calling me rude names and throwing things. They even bent all my spoons. I love those spoons like they were my children.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's terrible.}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh won't you help me stop them? Before they bend all my forks?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not the forks! Of course I'll help. But wait. I'm supposed to collect a whole lot of golden spatulas.}}
{{L|Plankton|Golden spatulas eh? SpongeBob if you could get me back into the Chum Bucket. I'll give you a bucket full of golden spatulas, in your dreams.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You've got a deal.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, this flapping robot crisis is makin the Krusty Krab lose money like a sinking ship, no money means no more Krusty Krab, no more Krusty Krab means no more fry cooking for you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|(Sadly sniffs) No more fry cooking?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|But because you're gullible, I'm gonna help you out, and of course make a small profit in return. I've got a few golden spatulas that i'll be willing to trade to you for some of those shiny objects.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You will?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Of course, what are employers for? Besides them shiny objects is worth lots of money. Your treasure chests looking a bit light boy, do you think I've got bilge water on the brain? I ain't runnin a charity here, come back when you've got enough shiny objects to trade.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey Patrick, nice sock.}}
{{L|Patrick|What sock?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The one you're standing on.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh that one, it's lost.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well if that one's lost where are your other socks?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh they're more lost, a bunch of robots came through here and stole my old sock collection. I could use some help getting them back.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure thing Patrick, what are best friends for?}}
{{L|Patrick|Ok then, for every 10 socks you bring back to me. I'll give you uh... a golden turkey baster.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You mean spatula?}}
{{L|Patrick|Bless you.}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|Hey SpongeBob. I just dropped by to give you a bubble hand.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Bubble Buddy.}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|You see, you're going to need to learn some new bubble-blowing moves, if you're going to journey to the ninth dimension and defeat the giant monkey man.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But uh... All I need to do is figure out how to get rid of these robots.}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|Oh, yeah, sorry. I've been in the soap bottle a little too long. Where were we?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, something about new bubble moves?}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|Right, press this button and you'll launch yourself straight up in the air with bubble power that defeats anything that is directly above you, try it out.}}
{{L|Squidward|First those stupid robots ruined a perfectly relaxing mud bath this morning, and now you show up, can my day get any more dreary?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I am so sorry Squidward, Patrick and I were just playing a game and-}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh! I correct myself. I should have known that whole robot problem involved both of you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, i don't know what to do. How can I fix everything?}}
{{L|Squidward|Why don't you move to another town? That should help out more than enough. Ha! Move to another town. I crack me up. But seriously, just jump around like an idiot. That should at least make me smile.}}
{{L|Squidward|Okay, okay, okay, just stop jumping will you? If you take this golden spatula, will you please go away?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|See Squidward. I knew that you could help me out, you're the best.}}
{{L|Squidward|Don't touch me.}}

===Jellyfish Fields===
{{L|French Narrator|Ah, the rolling green hills of jellyfish fields, a place to experience nature and it's the most raw, and sometimes a bit tender from the stings.}}
{{L|''(Squidward is shown screaming and running away from a Fodder. Three jellyfish corner him, then zap him, causing him to get thrown into the air before landing on the ground)''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oww...}}
{{L|''(The Fodder laughs and then leaves)''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oww!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward. Are you okay?}}
{{L|Squidward|No i'm not okay you barnacle head! Do I look like I'm okay?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well your nose does look pretty big. I mean bigger than usual because it's usually pretty big, and you look clammy. And- Oh my gosh! You're bald!}}
{{L|Squidward|I've always been bald, but now i'm stung all over.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, according to the jellyfisher Field Manual, severe jellyfish stings can be treated effectively by applying a thick layer of King Jellyfish jelly to the affected areas. (gulp) K-k-k-ing J-j-j-jellyfish?}}
{{L|Squidward|Well I guess you're off to scale Spork Mountain and die a horrible death under the vicious tentacles of King Jellyfish. I'll stay here, balled up here in excruciating pain.}}
{{L|SpongeBob (manly voice)|You do that, don't worry, Squidward. I'll bring back that King Jellyfish jelly for you to rub all over yourself.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey Gary, what's shaking?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! A bungee jump. For a golden spatula. I must be in... heaven.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! Mermaid Man. I have all your comics and toys and mail.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Eh, huh, what? Oh yeah, it's that sponge kid, now what was I suppose to tell you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That Patrick is surrounded by robots and needs my help.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Huh? Oh-no, I think it had something to do with massaging my feet.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well if massaging your feet will save Patrick, then massage I must.}}
{{L|Patrick|Help! Their making me hit myself.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Massaging your feet isn't working. I think i better try a more direct approach.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|By clipping my toenails?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Here I come Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whew! Thank goodness your safe Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well of course Spongebob, why would'nt I be?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well the robots and the-}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh yeah, I found this for ya. I don't know what it is, but it looks important.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, Patrick. I tell you what, all that running around has left me pooped. Why don't you continue on for a bit?}}
{{L|Patrick|Ok.}}
{{L|Plankton|Hey you barnacle head! Watch where your going!}}
{{L|Patrick|The rock... is talking to me. Oh mighty rock, I am at your command.}}
{{L|Plankton|Down here you big pink lummox!}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, hi there Mr. Plankton. Are you going to vaporize me?}}
{{L|Plankton|So, very, tempting. Unfortunately I've found myself in the undesirable position of having to assist you.}}
{{L|Patrick|I was in an undesirable position yesterday, and now my neck hurts.}}
{{L|Plankton|Heed my words my large future minion, go into jellyfish cave, follow the instructions on the signs that you see, at the end of the caves you'll still be a big pink idiot, but you'll know enough to help me defeat the robots and get me back into the chum bucket.}}
{{L|Patrick|Well then will you vaporize me?}}
{{L|Plankton|I might spare your life so i can force you to work in my sweatshop making low quality designer knockoff wallets.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh. Thank you.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ahoy there. Squidward tells me your looking for the king jellyfish.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yes.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Good thing too, that monster has been stinging all my good customers in their poop decks. I hear that you can find him on top of old Spork Mountain here. Go hook that beast sailor.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh boy Mr. Krabs. I'll see what I can do.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hello Mrs Puff.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Hello Patrick, i got a job for you to do.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh boy.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|I found a golden spatula, but those robots out on the island stole it and threw it into the lake. If you can figure out how to get it back, your welcome to it.}}
{{L|Patrick|Sho'nuff Mrs Puff.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Well done Patrick. Your a real star.}}
{{L|Patrick|Can I get a cookie?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|No.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Bubble Buddy. Gosh, everyone is trying to help me out today.}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|Step quietly there, that king jellyfish is just at the top of this path. Good luck, you'll need it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks Bubble Buddy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I knew that King jellyfish was big, but who knew he had such a beautiful voice?}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, yeah, Oh that feels so much better.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Anything for my best friend Squidward, can I rub some on?}}
{{L|Squidward|Um, what If I just gave you this?}}

===Downtown Bikini Bottom===
{{L|French Narrator|Downtown Bikini Bottom, once a bustling metropolis, now a debris covered crater.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|SpongeBob, the robots are destroying Downtown Bikini Bottom, we have to evacuate.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Alright, but it's gonna take a while to get all this dust.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Not vacuum. Evacuate, we have to get everyone to safety.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Can we just load them up in the boats?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|That won't do any good.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why not?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Because the robots have taken all the steering wheels.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Couldn't we just drive in a straight line.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|No, there are too many turns.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Those fiends, they thought of everything. Never fear Mrs. Puff. I'll get those steering wheels back}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|SpongeBob, if you're involved. I always fear, but i tell you what, if you can pull this off. I'll give you a golden spatula.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How 'bout a driver's license instead?}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Nice try.}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|This door is locked from the inside, who would do such a thing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi Gary.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes thanks for noticing. I have been working out.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Not done? Doesn't that mean-}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh that's the entrance to the rooftops which leads to the lighthouse? Aha! There's another golden spatula. I could really use that.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What do you mean get Sandy to help me? I can get though this.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow. Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh that gap looks big. Okay I'm definitely not making that jump. How is anyone going to get across there? Uh-oh. More robots. Holy Dutchman's Ghost! That gap looks impossible. It's impassable. Okay, okay. I'll go get Sandy to help me out.}}
{{L|Sandy|Hey Larry, what's shakin?}}
{{L|Larry|Sandy, boy am I glad to see you. I need your help, my TV reception has been terrible lately. I need to have someone replace my old antenna with this shiny new one.}}
{{L|Sandy|Yes sir, that there antenna is shinier than a $3 bill, well, why don't you replace it yourself?}}
{{L|Larry|I'm not really much of a jumper.}}
{{L|Sandy|So what's jumping got to do with it?}}
{{L|Larry|Because the old antenna is up there.}}
{{L|Sandy|Woo! That's taller than a glass of Texas iced tea.}}
{{L|Larry|The robots have blocked off that building and i can't do all those fancy moves you and SpongeBob do to get across these gaps, all I could do is flex, wanna see?}}
{{L|Sandy|Yeah great, so what are you gonna do with the old antenna?}}
{{L|Larry|Oh that? It's yours if you replace it with a new one.}}
{{L|Sandy|Well I have been getting bad TV reception in the treedome. Okay Larry, you got a deal.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ah there you are boy, someone's broken the sea needle.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's horrible, the sea needle is the cradle of crochet corner.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes, yes it is. But what's more important is that there are tikis and shiny objects just outside the windows.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, how can you think of money at a time like this?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Easy. I just clear my mind. Money, money, money. Now listen here boy, you know that i'll give you golden spatulas if you bring me shiny objects, but i'm going to sweeten the deal, if you can break all the tikis here at the sea needle. I'll give you a bonus golden spatula.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why would i want to break the tikis Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uh, because they were laughing at you and calling you funny names.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What kind of funny names?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Um, you know, SpongeBob ButtPants.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's not very funny.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uh, no, but they said your mom was ugly.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ugly?! Alright Mr. Krabs, break them I shall, you've got a deal.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Good work boy, here's the golden spatula like I promised.}}
{{L|Mrs Puff|SpongeBob, I'm impressed how did you find them?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well there were these robots, i met Sandy, and the lighthouse was-}}
{{L|Mrs Puff|Okay, okay. Sorry I asked, here's the golden spatula that I promised you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks Mrs Puff. Now i'll help you guys evacuate.}}
{{L|Mrs Puff|But SpongeBob, you don't have a driver's license.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh don't I?}}
{{L|Mrs Puff|No, no you don't.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well if I don't, then what's this?}}
{{L|Mrs Puff|A library card.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh.}}

===Goo Lagoon===
{{L|French Narrator|Ah Goo Lagoon, A sun drenched beach of sludge at the bottom of the sea. But, all is not well here "en" paradise.}}
{{L|Larry|SpongeBob, do I looked burned?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well you do look a little red.}}
{{L|Larry|Barnacles! That darn robot.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Robot?!}}
{{L|Larry|Yeah, a big robot stole everybody's sunscreen.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh-no! Everyone will burn, and then they'll get all itchy and peel.}}
{{L|Larry|Exactly, you can't spend a day at the beach without sunscreen. That sun is way too hot. That robot is out on the island, nobody can get to him. SpongeBob, maybe you can use those sun reflectors to point the sun's rays on that robot, if you hit one of the buttons on the side of a lifeguard tower, the reflector will turn, connect all the towers and the light will shoot right out of the big reflector on the island, then all you have to do is swim out to the island and turn the big reflector onto the robot. I'll stay here and protect the babes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But I uh... can't swim.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Oh-no, the children's balloons have been overfilled, they're carrying the children out of control.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know Mrs. Puff, it looks like they're having a lot of fun.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|Yes too much fun if you ask me, you can save the children by bubble bashing each of the balloons, bubble bash all the balloons then come see me for a reward.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Can do Mrs. Puff.}}
{{L|Mrs. Puff|My hero! You've saved the children, here's a golden spatula as a reward.}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|SpongeBob. I heard that you are collecting golden spatulas.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes Bubble Buddy. I am, have you seen one?}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|Why yes, we were having a sandcastle contest, and somebody put a golden spatula on the top.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|If I had a castle, I'd name it Fort Patty Town the third and Fort Patty Town the third would have a big bake sale every Monday.}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|Uhh... the golden spatula?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh at the top of the sand castle. Right. That should be easy to reach.}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|Well perhaps you should see for yourself.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hello Gary, what's new?}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You don't say? Squidward bought a new sweater? Oh he's so crazy.}}
{{L|Gary|Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And there's a golden spatula at the end of this cave. Wow!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Sorry lad, but the carnival is closed. A pesky robot has taken over me ticket booth. And worse, me money. If you help me get rid of that no-good robot. I'll give you a big reward.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, that's not exactly what i had in mind. I hope my insurance covers all this. Why don't you try something less expensive... er, i mean dangerous. I need them robots cleared out of the bumper boats. When you've destroyed them all, come back and see me.}}
{{L|Larry|Congratulations SpongeBob, you're king of the beach. Here have a golden spatula.}}

===Poseidome===
{{L|Neptune|I have brought you two here to face a great challenge.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I've got nerves of steel, and muscles of sand.}}
{{L|Patrick|And eyes of jelly.}}
{{L|Neptune|My Poseidome has been breached! By a mighty for who you must vanquish.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Bring it on your highness. Bring! It! On!}}
{{L|Johnny|In this corner, defending the Poseidome, a small square guy. And his challenger, a huge murderous robot shaped like a squirrel.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Er... I think I need to get home. To feed Gary.}}
{{L|Patrick|I wanna play! I wanna play!}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, we're not playing, we're fighting for our lives.}}
{{L|Patrick|I wanna play! I wanna play!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, alright.}}
{{L|Patrick|That was fun, okay SpongeBob. Your turn.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, uh... whee. (gulp)}}
{{L|Neptune|That was quite a battle, tell him what he's won, Johnny.}}
{{L|Johnny|It's a new power, the bubble bowl. But wait there's more, a golden spatula. And that's not all, a gift certificate for 5 dollars and 32 cents two Deans Little Shop of dried fish flakes and flowers.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh thank you, it all means so much. I... I... I promised myself I wouldn't cry.}}
{{L|Neptune|Cry all you want, but not here, we just waxed the floors.}}

===Bikini Bottom (second area)===
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Plankton.}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes? what is it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I was just wondering why all the robots seem to be coming from inside the Chum Bucket.}}
{{L|Plankton|Have they? I really haven't noticed.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um yeah. And then there's that big flashing neon sign that says robot headquarters.}}
{{L|(''Cuts to the sign on the Chum Bucket then back to Plankton'')}}
{{L|Plankton|SpongeBob I'm your friend right?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, not really.}}
{{L|Plankton|Exactly and as your non-friend. I worry about you. Like right now you're thinking too much. I'm worried you might really hurt yourself. Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna think for you. This way you won't hurt yourself and you can just keep working on getting me into the Chum Bucket.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks Plankton, you're the best non friend a friend could have, no more thinking for me.}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|Let me teach you how to bowl a bubble. Press this button and you'll Bowl a bubble that can knock down robots from a safe distance.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow!}}
{{L|Bubble Buddy|Remember though, the bubble bowl only works on things that are close to the ground.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Got it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! My heroes! Hit me with a water ball! Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|We don't do that stuff anymore kid. We're retired.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Is that the TV repairman?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|No it's that excited sponge kid again.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Oh. Are you sure he can't fix the TV?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mermaid Man, t'would be my greatest honor to fix your television.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Goody.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Hey Spongekid, you really want to help out?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh boy, would I!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Okay then, but lighten up a bit on the enthusiasm. You're making my bowels act up. We've got a little problem with some robots down in the Mermalair. Are you sure you're up to this task?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Absolutely, Barnacle Boy.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Well go over to the couch to access the Mermalair, we'll meet you down there.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Is it pudding night yet?}}

===Mermalair===
{{L|Mermaid Man|Eeeevilll!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Ahh!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|You shouldn't sneak up on Mermaid Man like that, his heart's not so good. Come to think of it, nothing on him is that good anymore.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry Mermaid Man, it's just that I'm always so excited to see you two! Standing in your awesome presence gives me the chills of justice! See, I've got goosebumps on my goosebumps on my goosebumps on my goosebumps on my-}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Alright kid, knock it off just tell us what you want?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well I really want a new pair of sunglasses. Patrick sat on my old ones.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|That's not what I meant.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Actually it's a good thing you showed up, young sponge of goodness!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It is?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|It is?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Yes, a bunch of evil robots have taken over the Mermalair security system. It's up to you to shut it down and stop them.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Why him? We're perfectly capable superheroes.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Because it's Thursday and we have a whole bunch of doctor's appointments.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Aww fish sticks! I forgot.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Go talk to the Mermalair computer in the next room, she'll tell you what to do.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I accept this awesome responsibility Mermaid Man, you won't be disappointed, shamed maybe, but not disappointed.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|To the doctor's office. Away!}}
{{L|French Narrator|The Mermalair, secret fortress of the wrinkly superheroes. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Squidward, am I happy to see you, and not just the kind of happy you feel in the front of your knees but the kind of happy of feeling the back of your elbow. You'll never believe what's been happening.}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah yeah. I've already been briefed by the geriatric duo. Those two old coots sent me in to get updated with the Mermalair Computer. But since you're here now. I'll let you do it, it's right over there. Look at this place. I mean puh-leeze! Would it kill them to lay down a few throw rugs? And all this wasted space. How did those two old fogies make all this?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh that's easy. In episode 27, the Mermalair is invaded by the digging monsters of Bermuda and they-}}
{{L|Squidward|Never mind!}}

{{L|Barnacle Boy|Hmm... we're gonna need a lot more power to activate the Hydro-acoustic Doppler modulator. Do you think you can handle this?}}
{{L|Patrick|I could see Squidward's house from up here, and he's not wearing any pants. Oh wait, he never wears pants.}}

{{L|Barnacle Boy|Oh-no. It looks like one of the villains is broken free.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|What's that? An evildoer on the loose? Who is it? Man Ray? The Atomic Flounder? The Dirty Bubble?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|No, worse than that. He's your arch enemy. Prawn.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Prawn!}}
{{L|Prawn|Did someone call? Oh I thought maybe I was looking at superheroes, but now I see it's just a couple of pieces of gnarled driftwood.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Prawn! I'll never forgive you, you madman!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What did Prawn do?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|The worst thing you can imagine, he put all of Mermaid Man's white clothes in the washer, with a red sock.}}

{{L|SpongeBob (manly voice)|I shall avenge you, Mermaid Man.}}
{{L|''(The [[Ham-Mer]] robots are now destroyed and Prawn is now frozen.)''}}

{{L|Sandy|This better not be some trick varmint.}}
{{L|Sandy|Nothin' a little Southern elbow grease can't handle!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey Mr. Krabs what are you doing?}}

{{L|Larry|I'm the fastest there is. My time down this slope is unbeatable. I'll give you a golden spatula if you can beat my time.}}
{{L|Plankton|Hello my most favorite friend in the whole world. I found another golden spatula for you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh Boy! Can i have it?}}
{{L|Plankton|Sure, if you fall down to the bottom of this pit.}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Actually I think that Patrick borrowed your equipment.}}
{{L|Squidward|What!? Who said he could do that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I did. I figured if you didn't know you wouldn't mind... again.}}
{{L|Squidward|Wouldn't mind!? Of course i mind. It's only the most expensive skiing equipment you can buy. And what does Patrick want with that stuff anyway? He doesn't even know how to ski.}}

{{L|''(Robo-Patrick is shown licking his ice cream.)''}}
{{L|Sandy|Well we better figure something out. And pronto!}}
{{L|''(A note is shown on the back of Robo-Ptrick and it says, "Kick me here!")''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Maybe that button on his back is a self-destruct. I'll try to hit it.}}
{{L|Sandy|Good idea SpongeBob, but it's time to stop yappin' and get to it.}}
{{L|''(Robo-Patrick is hit and then burps and fells on the floor, SpongeBob is scared and then tries to run but gets frozen)''}}

{{L|Plankton|Yes it's the Chum Bucket security system. I decided myself it makes me so proud. It was meant to keep out the hateful throngs of the unwashed. Unfortunately I never figured i'd be on this side of it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So what are you gonna do Plankton?}}
{{L|Plankton|We (of course meaning you) are gonna have to go out there and get those golden spatulas. Or i'll never get back into the Chum Bucket to regain control of my robots.}}

{{L|Plankton|Oh uh, I said 'will I ever get back into the Chum Bucket to stain all my pots?' Yes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmmm, something's fishy here.}}
{{L|Plankton|Keep looking for Golden Spatulas, SpongeBob. I'm sure that my robots out there have some.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey! You called them 'your' robots!}}
{{L|Plankton|No, I...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And I saw a plaque on the butt of one the robots that said 'Property of Plankton!'}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, maybe, but I..}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And I found this order form for robot parts with your signature on it!}}
{{L|Plankton|Can I have that back? I need it for my tax write-off.}}

{{L|SpongeBob|I'm a bubble blowing machine.}}
{{L|Johnny|Flash, authorities have confirmed that the robots running amok through Bikini Bottom are indeed coming from the Chum Bucket. Yes, right where you're standing.

*'''French Narrator''': One night in Bikini Bottom...
*'''Plankton''': Ha ha ha ha! When I finish building the Duplicatron 3000, my robots will allow me to rule Bikini Bottom! Ha ha ha ha ha! At last! Robots! I command you to get me a Krabby Patty! What? Robots? I command you! Come back! The switch! I forgot to flip the switch! 
*'''French Narrator''': The next morning...
*'''SponegBob''': Do you notice anything strange about Bikini Bottom today, Gary? Oh well... I better get back to the Krusty Krab for another great day at work! 
*'''Patrick''': Well I'll be hogited and horse-whipped SpongeBob! It looks like Bikini Bottom is infested with robots! Gee, I wondered why there was a robot in my shower this morning. 
*(Mr. Krabs arrives)
*'''Mr. Krabs''': SpongeBob! Those robots are scaring away all me customers! And they're making off with me Krabby Patties!
*'''Squidward''': Well, if there are no customers, I guess that means I get the day off, then.
*'''Mr. Krabs''': Arr! I bet my first dollar that Plankton's behind this Krabby Patty thievery! SpongeBob, you've got to get to the Chum Bucket and stop him or I'll run out of business!
*'''SpongeBob''': Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll put a stop to those robots!
*'''Sandy''': There's no stoppin' these robots, SpongeBob! If you destroy them, they just come back again! You'll just have to battle your way to the Chum Bucket and stop Plankton! Find three golden spatulas to unlock the warp gates to the next area of Bikini Bottom! Good luck, little square dude!
*'''Patrick''': Hi SpongeBob! Have you tried on jumping top of the robots? You can bounce off them that way!
*'''SpongeBob''': What's that, Gary? I should blow a bubble at the robots to deactivate them so I can push them around? Thanks, pal!
*'''Mr. Krabs''': Ahoy, SpongeBob! Try to find all me Krabby Patties! Don't let those robots get away with the secret recipe! Good job, SpongeBob! You found all me Krabby Patties! Now try to get all the Patties in this next area and you'll get a bonus! Good luck, me boy! 
*'''Patrick''': Hey SpongeBob, Mystery sure is a pretty seahorse, huh? Why don't you take her for a ride? .
*'''Sandy''': SpongeBob, you can use Mystery to chomp robotsand spit 'em out someplace else. She also loves to eat flowers.
*'''Patrick''': Did you know you can ride on some of the robots, SpongeBob? It's like being at Glove World!
*'''Sandy''': Sometimes you may have to float across a large gap, SpongeBob! Look out, SpongeBob! That bot over there has more spikes than a prickly pear cactus! I don't reckon even Mystery can swallow that thing! 
*'''Patrick''': Do you know that sometimes that have you to jump off of Mystery in midair, SpongeBob?
*'''Mermaid Man''': Use the invisible boatmobile to collect all the Krabby Patties, sonny! If you do, you'll get a bonus! Now go get 'em! And watch out for those EVIL robots!
*'''Sandy''': Howdy SpongeBob! Do you know you can push those blocks around? Then you can use 'em to reach higher areas.
*'''Fish''': Hey mister! Are you going to stop the bots? I think they're cool! See that bot over there? I bet his shots can destroy stuff that gets in your way!
*'''Patrick''': Hey SpongeBob! You need to find the key before you can go through the door over there. Those robots are pretty tricky, huh?
*'''Sandy''': I'm glad you're here, SpongeBob! Those ornery robots have taken over my tree dome! I know it's pretty dry in here though, so take a dip in my birdbath if you need some water! Now go stop those robots! Thanks for helping me out with those robots, SpongeBob. Those critters sure do cause a mess load of trouble. SpongeBob, look out! Why that robot's bigger 'an the state of Texas! And it looks like me! 
*'''SpongeBob''': You're right, Sandy! I wonder if it knows karate, too?
*'''Sandy''': You think you can handle it, SpongeBob? I bet if you stomp on it's head, you can crack it's helmet! Go for it! Way to go, little square dude! You put a hurtin' on that robot imposter!
*'''SpongeBob''': Thanks, Sandy. That robot's kah-rah-tay is no match for trusty bubble wand. 
*'''Squidward''': Don't bother me on my day off, SpongeBob! Why don't you concentrate on stopping those robots from taking over Bikini Bottom?!
*'''Mr. Krabs''': SpongeBob, those robots are still scaring away me customers! You've got to stop them or I'll go out of business! There's no time for jellyfishing now, SpongeBob! You've got to get to the Chum Bucket! And watch out for that bot over there... it's got an explosive temper! 
*'''Patrick''': I'm going to catch a jellyfish if it's the last thing I do, SpongeBob!
*'''Fish''': Hey mister, do you know that you have to hit some robots with your bubble in order to turn them on?
*'''Fish 2''': Hey, buddy, watch out for those bots up ahead. You'll be in for the shock of your life if you bump into them! Hey buddy, you see that pressure plate over there? If you stand on it, that door opens up. Pretty far out, huh? 
*'''Sandy''': SpongeBob! Y'all better watch out for that bot up ahead! It will charge at you if you bump into it and won't stop until it hits something!
*'''SpongeBob''': Hi Squidward!
*'''Squidward''': Oh joy, if it isn't CowBob RanchPants. Go away! And take Sir Eats-A-Lot with you!
*'''Mermaid Man''': How did you figure those robots got into the Mermaidlair, sonny?
*'''Patrick''': Hey SpongeBob, look at that robot! Did you see the size of his jellyfishing net? 
*'''SpongeBob''': That robot isn't after jellyfish, Patrick, it's after Krabby Patties!
*'''Patrick''': Uh oh, SpongeBob, it's coming this way... and it looks angry! Run! Hey, you stopped it! But don't you think that robot was pretty good looking, SpongeBob?
*'''Mr. Krabs''': I don't pay you to stand around, SpongeBob! Those robots are still scaring away me customers! Hurry and get to the Chum Bucket so you can stop Plankton!
*'''Fish''': Hey mister, do you see those bubble blocks? You can alternate between the red and blue bubble blocks by blowing a bubble at the bubble switch.
*'''Patrick''': Hey SpongeBob! I think I saw Mystery up ahead. I still haven't found any jellyfish, though. Hey SpongeBob, hoe's it going? Have you seen any jellyfish around here? 
*'''Squidward''': How is it you always manage to find me, SpongeBob? Can't you tell I want to be alone?
*'''Sandy''': Don't fall in that goo, SpongeBob! It's more toxic than a gas vent in Sulphur Fields!
*'''Squidward''': Why are you bothering me, SpongeBob? Aren't you supposed be headed for the Chum Bucket? Wait, that's that? It's the most beautiful sound I've ever heard! 
*'''SpongeBob''': Look out Squidward! It's another big, ugly robot! 
*'''Squidward''': Why must you destroy everything that's beautiful, SpongeBob? You have no ear for great music, do you? 
*'''SpongeBob''': Hi! Do you know the way to the Chum Bucket?
*'''Fish''': Pfft.... pfft... pffft....
*'''SpongeBob''': Gary! What are you doing so far away from home? What's that, boy? I can jump on that bot over there to get a boost? Thanks! Now take yourself back home this instant! 
*'''Patrick''': It sure is strange around here, SpongeBob. I jumped into one of those glowing things and ended up here. 
*'''Sandy''': Hey there, SpongeBob! Why, you're tougher than the hide on a buckin' bronco! I'm glad you're showing those robots who's boss!
*'''Mermaid Man''': I tell ya, sonny, fighting crime isn't as easy as it used to be. These robots are just too fast for me.
*'''Mr. Krabs''': Good job, SpongeBob! You've almost made it to the Chum Bucket! Now hurry up and stop Plankton! I'm losing money as long as robots is runnin' loose!
*'''Plankton''': Ah, SpongeBob... I was expecting the Kursty Krab's best fry cook to come here and try to stop me! I had the perfect plan, you know... With the Duplicatron 3000 I created an army of robots to steal a Krabby Patty so I could discover the secret recipe. I even created my own giant robot chef to make my own Krabby Patties! Unfortunately, I forgot to make the robots obey me, and now they're trying to discover the formula without me! It was my plan, I tell you, my plan! But no matter, SpongeBob! My robots may not be loyal to me, but they're still going to discover the Krabby Patty formula... and then I'll just steal it from them! Hahahaha! 
*'''SpongeBob''': You'll never get away with stealing a Krabby Patty, Plankton! Not if I destroy the Duplicatron! Come on, Mystery! 
*'''Plankton''': The Duplicatron! My robots! My plan! All ruined! Why me? Why me?
*'''SpongeBob''': I hope you learned your lesson! You make a Krabby Patty with love, Plankton, not robots! 
*'''Plankton''': Now you tell me!
