{{L|''[The episode begins on another beautiful day at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his military hat and is holding a swagger stick.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|All right, Krusty crew, I want to remind you all that you're representing the Krusty Krab â€” the greasiest greasy spoon you'll ever have the privilege of serving!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob's face is painted red and is wearing a claw-shaped form hand with #1 on it.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoo! You tell 'em, Mr. Krabs! ''[rips off pants]'' Bring it around town! Yeah!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs whips SpongeBob's face. Squidward is wearing a smiling mask. Mr. Krabs whips him the mask off of Squidward as he appears to be sleeping.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[blubbers]'' Bring it around somewhere!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs jumps on the table.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Open the doors and let the consuming commence! I'll be in me office polishing yesterday's booty. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs walks into his office.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[imitating Mr. Krabs]'' "I'll be in me office polishing yesterday's booty." ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob gasps at Squidward's imitation and laughs. Mr. Krabs pops out of the cash register and glares at Squidward.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[angrily]'' I heard that, Mr. Squidward!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob hides in his hat.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[nervously]'' It wasn't an insult, Mr. Krabs. It was a... tribute. Haven't you ever heard of "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob's eyes peek out under his hat.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You trying to tell me that was a "complement"?}}
{{L|Squidward|Exactly. It's my homage to you and your love for money.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[grumbles]'' Well, you got me there. I do love money. ''[giggles]'' Excellent observation, Mr. Squidward!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs dives into the cash register. SpongeBob comes out from hiding in his hat.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, boy, that was a close one.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yes, it was a very close one, Squidward. Close and warm. ''[his eyes widen]'' Mr. Krabs was really flattered by your imitation.}}
{{L|Squidward|Already forgot about it.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob runs up to the window and looks at various people passing by the restaurant.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Imitation plus flattery equals happy people. ''[hums as he gets an idea]''}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to Tom with his kids sitting at a table. SpongeBob serves a plate of Krabby Patties to the kids.]''}}
{{L|Tom|Whoa, okay. Everybody, come on now. Settle down, time to eat your patties.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob morphs his body to look like Tom.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Tom]'' Whoa, okay now. Everybody, settle down, time to eat your patties. ''[changes back to normal]'' Huh?}}
{{L|''[The kids laugh, but Tom looks infuriated. However, he does like it.]''}}
{{L|Tom|Wow, that's just like me! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob takes a bow and walks off while Tom's kids continue to laugh.]''}}
{{L|Tom|''[angry]'' I said eat your patties!}}
{{L|''[Tom pounds on the table and the kids frightfully eat their meals.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Hurry up, SpongeBob, I need two double orders of Krabby Krusts stat.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No problem, Squidward, I'll get you those orders as soon as possible.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob morphs his body to look like Squidward.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Squidward]'' Or never, whichever comes first.}}
{{L|''[Everyone laughs as SpongeBob walks into the kitchen.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh swoon. That imitation stuff really works. Look out world! ''[his faces morphs into a handsome man, and in a voice similar to the narrator from Powerpuff Girls]'' I'm gonna flatter your socks off! ''[his teeth glimmers]''}}
{{L|''[Patrick is outside the restaurant digging in a garbage can. He pulls out a partially eaten Krabby Patty.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hmm. Nope. ''[throws away patty and pulls out a soda cup]'' Ah.}}
{{L|''[Patrick eats the soda cup and SpongeBob sneaks up behind him through the front doors. SpongeBob giggles and morphs himself into Patrick.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Patrick]'' Hey, there, Patrick old buddy.}}
{{L|Patrick|What? Oh, hi, Patrick. What's shaking?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Patrick]'' I'm gonna eat ice cream and go jellyfishing with my good buddy SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Patrick|Sounds good to me, "me"!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob morph back to normal.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah, it's just me, Patrick! Fooled ya! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[laughs]'' You can't fool me, "me". That's the worst SpongeBob impression I've ever seen.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[laughs but then becomes confused]'' Wait, what?}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to Sandy playing chess with Plankton outside the Chum Bucket. Plankton pushes the black rook to the next square.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Rook to king four.}}
{{L|''[Plankton pushes the piece, groaning. The rook topples over and squashes him.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Check-mate...}}
{{L|''[Sandy yanks and unsticks the piece off of him]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Plankton, maybe we should play a game that's a little less dangerous. You're flatter than hammered horse hockey.}}
{{L|''[Sandy, with a disgusted look on her face, pokes squished Plankton with her finger. SpongeBob pops up and morphs his body into Sandy.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitates Sandy, leans over and crushes him with his artificial helmet]'' Cattywampus, Plankton. You're just about the teeniest gal-dang critter I ever did see. Yee-haw!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob forms another head that resembles Plankton.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Plankton]'' And you are the fuzziest nut-eating scientist I've ever seen. ''[evil laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Sandy]'' I like to use science for good.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Plankton]'' Really? I always use science for evil!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[laughs as she claps]'' That is me to a Texas "T", SpongeBob! He nailed you too, Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|It was okay. He got my face right, but that voice is terrible.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob morphs back to normal.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, those impressions are making everyone so happy! I can't stop doing them! I can't..I won't.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob morphs his body into Gary and meows like him.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating the French Narrator as he reads the time card]'' 80,000 impressions later...}}
{{L|French Narrator|Would you please stop imitating me? It is starting to get very annoying.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab as SpongeBob, who morphed his body to look like Nathiel, serves a Krabby Patty to Nathiel.]''}}
{{L|Nathiel Waters|Uh, can I have some extra napkins please?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Nathiel]'' Oh, you want some napkins, please?}}
{{L|Nathiel Waters|Stop it! Stop imitating me! For the love of Neptune, shut your talented mouth! ''[runs out of the restaurant]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, bye. Yup, everybody still loves it. ''[sighs]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob morphs his body into Squidward.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Squidward]'' Are we having fun yet, Squidward Tentacles? ''[laughs as he walks into the kitchen]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Oh, that's it! I can't stand the perfect impression of me anymore! I never thought I'd say this, but I'm tired of looking at myself. I quit! ''[throws his hat and leaves]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Boy, SpongeBob is really getting out of control with his impression obsession.}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs pops out of the cash register.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Ah!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Right you are, Sandy. SpongeBob has lost touch with reality. I've seen it before. They call it: the "mocking mimicry madness."}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob sneaks up behind with his body morphed into Mr. Krabs.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Mr. Krabs]'' The mocking mimicry madness. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs screams and hides into the cash register.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, oh, oh! ''[falls backwards]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Huh! Oh.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob laughs. The scene changes to Patrick, Plankton, Squidward, Mr. Krabs and Sandy standing outside of SpongeBob's house.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|All right, remember, guys, this is an intervention. So we need to make sure that above all, SpongeBob knows how much we all care about him.}}
{{L|Plankton|Why don't we just destroy him and get it over with?}}
{{L|Squidward|Hear, hear.}}
{{L|''[Patrick grabs Plankton and Squidward and strangles them really hard.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|You leave my best friend alone!}}
{{L|Plankton and Squidward|''[muffled]'' It was just a suggestion!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Spread out! All right, you scurvy dogs, SpongeBob needs us, and more importantly, I need him... to stop imitating me customers!}}
{{L|Sandy|Right, guys. That's... almost... the spirit.}}
{{L|''[Sandy rings the doorbell.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh boy, someone's at the door! I can't wait to imitate 'em! ''[opens the door as his friends enter]'' Oh, hello Patrick! And Sandy? And Squidward? And Mr. Krabs? Plankton too? Five at once, huh? Okay, here goes nothing.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob strains himself and morphs his body into five of his friends all at once.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating his friends]'' Hi! Ahoy! Howdy! Greetings. Go away.}}
{{L|All|''[creeped out]'' Ugh!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[Terrified]'' Why?!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[nervous]'' Hi, SpongeBob. We need to talk.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating his friends]'' Why sure! Aye! Love to! About what? Who cares?}}
{{L|Sandy|You know, it's okay to be yourself, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[struggles to get his body back to normal]'' I'm trying, Sandy, I'm trying!}}
{{L|Sandy|You can do it, SpongeBob, just concentrate, and it'll all come back to ya!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob takes a deep breath and struggles to revert himself to normal. His friends cringe in fear. SpongeBob's body morphs into various characters.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating various characters]'' Good morning, Gary! Meow. Duh! Me money! ''[laughs]'' Karate chop. Ha! I went to college! I said eat your patties! ''[talks normal as his body is messed up]'' I can't do it! I'm a freak! A freak! ''[imitating Plankton]'' I'm a freak!}}
{{L|Plankton|Hey!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob, with his completely deformed face, runs out of his house, crying.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[cluelessly]'' That went well.}}
{{L|''[The scene changes to nighttime. SpongeBob is hiding in a dark cave where is body is morphed into an owl.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|â™ªWho?, Who?, Who?, Who? Who?, Who?, Who?, Who? Who... am I? ''[morphs into a question mark]'' Who am I? ''[morphs into a pineapple]'' I just can't remember. ''[morphs into Pearl]'' Who am I? ''[imitates Pearl]'' I just can't recall. ''[morphs into handsome man and imitates him]'' Who am I to sing this somber song? When you've got six heads, there's something wrong. ''[morphs into five of his friends]'' Who am I? ''[imitates his friends]'' Please tell me. ''[normal]'' Who am I? ''[imitates his friends]'' Do you know me? ''[morphs into a female fish]'' My name could be Clementine ''[morphs into Fred]'' or it could be Freddie. ''[morphs into two SpongeBobs]'' I just can't recognize myself. I don't know if I'm ready. ''[imitating his friends in a barber shop quintet]'' I'm ready! ''[normal]'' Who am I? ''[morphs into a male fish]'' I have a right to know. ''[normal]'' Who am I? Am I friend... ''[morphs into Plankton and imitates him]'' or foe? ''[normal]'' I have so many features. It makes it hard to tell. I don't know what my first name is. But my faces ring a bell. ''[imitates Squidward]'' Who am I? ''[bell dings] [imitates Mr. Krabs]'' Who am I? ''[bell dings] [imitates Patrick]'' Who am I? ''[bell dings] [imitates Plankton]'' [bell dings]'' Who am I? ''[normal]'' Who am I? ''[phone rings]'' Hello-o-o?â™ª}}
{{L|Caller|Hello. To whom am I speaking?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|â™ªI... don't... kno-o-ow...â™ª}}
{{L|''[As SpongeBob's song ends, his face shrivels.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|The salty tear trail leads right in here.}}
{{L|Sandy|There he is!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob groans as his friends run up to him.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Are you all right, SpongeBob? How many fingers am I holding up?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob groans and morphs into a letter B.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|B.}}
{{L|Patrick|Good SpongeBob! I had the same answer.}}
{{L|Sandy| ''[annoyed, looks at Patrick]'' I know you're in there somewhere, SquarePants!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob morphs into a telephone.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're sorry, the person you are calling â€” SpongeBob SquarePants â€” has been disconnected or is no longer in service.}}
{{L|Sandy|Okay, guys, SpongeBob imitates whoever he hears. So we've all got to do is imitate him to help him remember who he is. ''[pulls out a paintbrush with yellow paint]'' This should help!}}
{{L|''[Sandy paints yellow paint on Mr. Krabs.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hey!}}
{{L|''[Sandy paints yellow paint on Squidward and Patrick.]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[rubs himself]'' Mmm! Mmm!}}
{{L|''[Sandy paints yellow paint on herself. Plankton tries to run but Sandy catches him.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Ah! Hold still, you little rascal!}}
{{L|''[Sandy dips Plankton into a bucket of yellow paint. Plankton spits out the paint.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[sarcastically]'' What a great idea. ''[spits out paint]'' Ugh!}}
{{L|Sandy|''[imitating SpongeBob]'' I'm a square and yellow critter! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[imitating SpongeBob]'' I like cooking with lard! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[imitating SpongeBob]'' Mr. Krabs is the best boss in the whole ocean! ''[snickers]'' Oop! Sorry, I meanâ€” ''[laughs like SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[imitating SpongeBob]'' I forgot the secret Krabby Patty formula, Mr. K. Would you remind me again?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[imitating SpongeBob]'' Sure, SpongeBob, I got it rightâ€” ''[normal]'' Oh, no, you don't, Plankton!}}
{{L|''[Mr. Krabs smashes Plankton with the bottle.]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That was a pretty good impression, though.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[dizzy]'' Thanks.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob's body is becoming much more messed up than before.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[groans]'' It's not working, fellers! We need to combine our efforts and do an impression of SpongeBob all at the same time! Okay, all together now!}}
{{L|All|''[imitating SpongeBob]'' I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob's body continues to go out of control, until SpongeBob reverts himself back to his normal state.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I remember! I know who I am! I am SpongeBob SquarePants, and yes, I do like cooking with lard! ''[holds up his spatula with lard]''}}
{{L|''[His friends cheer.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thanks, guys. You're the best friends a guy with memory loss could have. It sure feels great to just be yourself. Doesn't it, guys? Guys?}}
{{L|''[Suddenly, SpongeBob's friends morph into five imitations of SpongeBob and they all laugh like him.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, no! Now they have mocking mimicry madness! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|''[As they continue to laugh, two small Squidwards appear in Squidward's eyes, knocking on them.]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Let me out! Let me out!}}
