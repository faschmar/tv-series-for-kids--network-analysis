{{L|''[At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is making a [[Krabby Patty]] with a rainbow patty. He finishes it and briefly admires his work.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Order up!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[wakes up to SpongeBob's voice and screams]'' What is that? ''[points to the rainbow Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I call it a "rainbowger." It contains all the colors of the rainbow. ''[zooms in to SpongeBob's shining eyes]'' It will bring the whole world together.}}
{{L|Squidward|Yeah, together to hea-.}}
{{L|''[They are interrupted by the front door opening.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Hello! ''[shot zooms out and reveals Plankton is sitting in a small machine of some sort]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob and Squidward are startled by Plankton's sudden appearance.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[laughs]'' Let's see how popular your precious patties are after I zap all the color out of them with my color nullifier! ''[laughs]'' ''[presses a button on the color nullifier.]''}}
{{L|''[A beam shoots out of the color nullifier, which sucks the color from the rainbowger into the nullifier]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[laughs]'' ''[the colors start to jam the color nullifier]'' Wha- What? Oh, no! It's taking in too many colors at once! ''[screams]''}}
{{L|''[The color nullifier stars shooting colors all around the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Frank|''[color hits him]'' Ooh! ''[becomes purple with white spots]''}}
{{L|Norma Rechid|''[laughs at Frank]'' ''[gets hit by color]'' Eww! ''[becomes plaid]''}}
{{L|Frank|''[laughs at Norma Rechid]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[color hits him; becomes brown, white, and pink, like his ice cream]'' Huh? ''[shurgs]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[color continues to be blasted out of the nullifier]'' No, no! You should have no colors!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[watches proceedings with black and white rainbowger still in his hand]'' ''[color hits him]'' Whoa! ''[transforms into many different colors before eventually becoming green]'' Hey, look at me! I'm a coloring book. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[comes out of kitchen]'' What a wonderful publicity stunt! Thanks, Plankton! ''[gets hit by color, becomes striped purple and yellow]''}}
{{L|''[The force of the color nullifier still blasting color pushes Plankton out of the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|''[Squidward becomes rainbow]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ooh, Squidward! I didn't know you were such a colorful character. I'm green with envy.}}
{{L|Squidward|It's just superficial. Inside, I'm just blue.}}
