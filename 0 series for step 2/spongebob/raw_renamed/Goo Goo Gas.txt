{{L|''[It is a normal day at the Krusty Krab. All of a sudden, Plankton, disguised as a peppershaker, steals a Krabby Patty from a customer.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Ha ha! ''[runs out of the Krusty Krab. However, Mr. Krabs picks him up from behind]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Hold it right there, Plankton.}}
{{L|Plankton|Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I'll take that. ''[Gets the Krabby Patty from him]''}}
{{L|Plankton|How'd you know it was me?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it.}}
{{L|Plankton|Hmmm... perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You think? SpongeBob! ''[SpongeBob runs onto the scene]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wooo-ooo! ''[Krabs puts Plankton in his mouth, his eyes turn into numbers counting down]''}}
{{L|Announcer|''[off-screen]'' 3, 2, 1…, launch! ''[SpongeBob launches Plankton out of his hat and through the Chum Bucket roof]''}}
{{L|Plankton|AAHH!}}
{{L|''[Cut to the park. Plankton is on a bench]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs' formula! Mr. Krabs is too powerful. If only there were a way to render him helpless!}}
{{L|Sadie|''[with her baby]'' Oh, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless.}}
{{L|Plankton|Hey, I resent that! Huh?}}
{{L|Sadie|''[she takes the bottle from her baby]'' Why, you're so tiny and helpless, I could take your formula whenever I wanted to and you couldn't do a thing about it. ''[the baby starts crying, Sadie puts the bottle back into her baby's mouth and moves on]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerless… baby.}}
{{L|''[Cut to Mr. Krabs walking up to his restaurant]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[A penny catches his eye]'' Ooh, a penny. ''[He sees a trail of pennies]'' A trail of pennies! ''[They lead him into a phone booth outside. We see some green gas appear around Krabs.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|I've done it! Nothing can stop me now! My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant! ''[He opens the phone booth, and grabs the key.]'' The key to the Krusty Krab. This is easier than I hoped. ''[Looks at baby Krabs]'' He's a little bigger than I imagined. ''[baby Krabs takes the key and swings it up and down, then puts Plankton into his mouth and starts biting him]'' Whoa! No, no! Ow, ow, ow! Oof! Whoa! ''[baby Krabs then sucks on Plankton, and releases him. He runs for the front doors of the Krusty Krab, with Krabs following behind him, but he can't reach.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here all alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up! ''[baby Krabs giggles]'' Oh, aren't you just too cute. ''[tickles baby Krabs]'' Coochie coochie coo! ''[they both laugh]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Hello! If you're done making a total fool out of yourself, I could use some help with this lock.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, sure thing, Plankton. ''[places baby Krabs on top of him]'' Here you go, little guy. ''[places the key inside the door]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes, my plan is working perfectly! Now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine! ''[laughs, stops then notices SpongeBob staring at him]'' Hello.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looking at Plankton after hearing what he just said]'' Police! Police!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[getting arrested]'' Fools, you'll never hold me! Your primitive shackles are no match for my genius. ''[the cuffs are too wide, and he easily escapes, dropping to the ground before running away, with the police on pursuit]'' That was easy. I'm free! Free!}}
{{L|''[Squidward walks up to the Krusty Krab, looking glum as always]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby! ''[SpongeBob shows Squidward baby Krabs]'' It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned him into an infant so he could steal the Krabby Patty formula! ''[baby Krabs burps in Squidward's face]'' What do we do, Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|I don't know about you, but I'm going on my coffee break. A very long coffee break. ''[walks away]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[back at the Chum Bucket, talking to Karen]'' …and then that blasted sponge called the cops! That's just not cricket. ''[pouts]'' Now I'll never be a tyrannical overlord.}}
{{L|Karen|Do I have to tell you how to do everything? Next time, spray SpongeBob, too.}}
{{L|Plankton|Not sure I follow you.}}
{{L|Karen|Listen carefully. Spray...}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes.}}
{{L|Karen|...Sponge....}}
{{L|Plankton|Uh-huh.}}
{{L|Karen|....Bob.....}}
{{L|Plankton|Right.}}
{{L|Karen|....Too!}}
{{L|Plankton|Now you're just talking gibberish. What I really need is to spray Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Karen|Ugh! That's just what I...}}
{{L|Plankton|I don't wanna hear anymore of your loony schemes, Karen. I've got work to do!}}
{{L|''[Back at the Krusty Krab, baby Krabs starts to cry.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aw, what's wrong, Mr. Baby Krabs? Are you thirsty? ''[gives him some milk and he stops crying]'' That's it, drink up! ''[baby Krabs spits out the bottle and he continues to cry]'' Okay, maybe you're hungry? How about a nice soft Krabby Patty? ''[baby Krabs slaps it away and continues to cry]'' Yikes, not even a Krabby Patty helps. ''[reaches into his pocket]'' How about a stack of $20s? ''[shows a stack of $20 bills; Krabs takes it and chews on it]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Hands in the air!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[pops up at the scene, with a gas tank behind his back]'' That's right, SpongeBob, I'm back! And you won't stop me this time. ''[starts to spray. Mr. Krabs turns back into an adult, wearing a diaper, and SpongeBob turns into a baby]'' What? SpongeBob's a baby, but Krabs is back to normal? ''[sprays again. Mr. Krabs returns to his baby form as SpongeBob returns to normal, but is still wearing a rectangular diaper and is barefoot]'' It seems the second dose acts as an antidote! [sprays only SpongeBob, and he is turned back into a baby again] One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult! ''[sprays both of them once, and they come back to normal. They're still wearing their diapers]'' Or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult? ''[tries to spray them, but nothing comes out]'' Barnacles, I've run out of gas!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ahem!}}
{{L|Plankton|Krabs! Nice diaper. ''[Mr. Krabs is about to throw him]'' Hold on, hold on! I think I... ''[throws him like a slingshot pellet; cut to Plankton flying in the air]'' Yes, I've got it!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[checking the mailbox]'' Better be something other than bills this time. ''[Plankton comes out]'' Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|Peek-a-boo!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[running back in the Krusty Krab]'' I can't tolerate your stinky gas!}}
{{L|Dennis|''[farts]''}}
{{L|Miss Shell|That makes two of us. ''[drinks her cup]''}}
{{L|Dennis|I don't do it on purpose!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You'll never catch me, Plankton! Never! Ooh…another penny! Come to papa! Now, what were we doing?}}
{{L|Plankton|This! ''[sprays him]'' What's the matter, baby? Are you gonna cry? ''[Mr. Krabs has turned into a senior citizen]'' What the heck happened to you? This isn't baby gas, it's senior citizen spray!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Eh? What was that, sonny?}}
{{L|Plankton|Out of my way, Methuselah! You're old and useless. ''[SpongeBob comes out of nowhere]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!}}
{{L|Plankton|I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again! ''[sprays the gas on SpongeBob, turning him into a senior citizen]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Plankton|This baby gas is worthless! ''[throws the spray fan away]'' At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What was that, sonny?}}
{{L|Plankton|It'll take more time to explain than you have left. ''[walks away; runs back out with a Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[sniffs]'' He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Catch who?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, Gesundheit.}}
{{L|Plankton|Victory is mine! ''[the bottom of the walkers cause Plankton to jump]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Come back here, you little whippersnapper!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You kids get off my lawn! I'll catch up with you, boy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm catching up with my knitting.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[hatches an idea]'' That's it! Knit, little nitwit!}}
{{L|Plankton|That was almost too easy. ''[Plankton is caught in a knitwear net]'' What? No! I demand you geezers release me!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Right after the party. The piñata party. ''[A group of senior citizens show up]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What?}}
{{L|Senior Citizens|''[beating Plankton with their canes and walkers]'' That's for calling us old.}}
{{L|Plankton|Hey, quit it!}}
{{L|Senior Citizens|I want candy!}}
{{L|Plankton|No!}}
{{L|''[Cut to the Chum Bucket, with Plankton in his lab, writing something on a chalk board.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|One squirt equals baby, carry over the two plus the square root of SpongeBob. Of course! The final ingredient that I've been lacking! It's so simple yet so evil! And I know just the place to get it.}}
{{L|''[Cut to Barg'n Mart]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Excuse me, what aisle did you get that from?}}
{{L|Shubie|You mean the Kelp-O?}}
{{L|Plankton|No, that thing--the ugly, drippy, smelly thing.}}
{{L|Shubie|Are you talking about my baby, creep?! ''[Chases Plankton with her cart. She ends up squashing him by running him over.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Ow, ow, ow! ''[moans]'' Baby powder? This could be just what I need! Hey, buddy, is this made of real or artificial babies? ''[Shubie squishes Plankton again with her cart.]'' Ow, ow, ow, ow! ''[Cut to the Chum Bucket]'' That powdered baby did the trick! Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!}}
{{L|Karen|Just like all your other plans that "couldn't possibly fail"?}}
{{L|Plankton|What is it now, Karen?}}
{{L|Karen|I'm saying you should test your gas before you run over there all willy nilly!}}
{{L|Plankton|That's an excellent idea. And I know just the guinea pig! ''[Grabs the pack and points it at Karen]''}}
{{L|Karen|''[gasps]'' Plankton, don't you dare! ''[sprays her and a calculator falls to the ground]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Karen! Speak to me! ''[the calculator types in "hello" as 07734 upside down]'' It worked!}}
{{L|''[Cut to the Krusty Krab, where the old Mr. Krabs is drinking a soda]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Everyone say your ABCs! ''[sprays two people, turning them into babies]'' Now when you turn into babies, ''[they both start crying]'' you stay babies! ''[Plankton sprays two more people]'' Hey, Krabs, catch! ''[throws a gas bomb which turns Mr. Krabs into a baby, who starts crying. SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's wrong, little feller? ''[A gas bomb is thrown at him and explodes, turning him into a baby. They both cry.]''}}
{{L|''[Cut to an aerial view of the Krusty Krab where everyone is turning into babies. Patrick is seen turning into a baby. Squidward opens the bathroom door and sees what's going on, then walks away. A gas bomb explodes in the bathroom turning Squidward into a crying baby.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|My moment of triumph! ''[slips on some drool]'' What the...? ''[SpongeBob, Krabs, and Squidward are drooling over Plankton]'' Oh, gross! I command you to stop drooling on me!}}
{{L|Baby Mr. Krabs|Goo!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[he yelps. Baby Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton.]'' Put me down! ''[baby Mr. Krabs just shakes him playfully like a rattle]'' Ow! ''[shakes him again]'' Stop it! I'm an adult! ''[SpongeBob grabs him and starts sucking on him like a pacifier. Spits him out into Patrick's diaper. Patrick farts and Plankton runs away from him, screaming]'' Huh? I don't believe it! ''[Plankton sees Krabs sucking on the secret formula bottle]'' The Krabby Patty formula! He's teething on it! Give it here, you big stupid baby! ''[baby Krabs smashes Plankton with the bottle]'' Ow. ''[he squishes him four more times as Baby Thaddeus laughs. As baby Mr. Krabs crawls away, Plankton emerges, groaning in pain]'' I've got it! Just like taking candy from a baby! Get it, Krabs? I'm taking candy from ''you!'' ''[baby SpongeBob starts playing with the gas tank by repeatedly banging it against the ground]'' Hey! What are you doing? ''[the gas tank rises into the air like a rocket ship and releases gas everywhere, which sprays onto Plankton]'' Uh-oh. ''[he shrinks into microscopic size with amoebas floating around]'' Ahem... ''[he covers himself]'' Mama's evil little genius needs a diaper!}}
