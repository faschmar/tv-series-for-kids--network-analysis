{{L|Patrick|''[screaming while flying on his sandboard, then bashes his body on sand mountain. The red word "DEAD" flashes, also making a ¨death¨ sound effect]''}}
{{L|''[Screen zooms out, revealing that Patrick is only playing a video game with his character while sandboarding down Sand Mountain]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Aww, I got dead again. This game stinks. ''[hits a rock and flies and screams then bashes his body on sand mountain just like on his video game]''}}
{{L|Sandy|See? That's why you must always pay attention to the mountain.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm listening to you, mountain! ''[starts sandboarding, and he passes by Patrick's legs]'' Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, yeah, I forgot. ''[eats yellow sand on a plate]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Sandy, watch me do the "Grouchy Squidward."}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sits at a table drinking tea close to the mountain]'' Stop naming moves after me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[imitating Squidward]'' Everybody's an idiot except for me.}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, it's true. ''[takes a sip]''}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob laughs like Squidward; Sandy and Patrick laugh with him]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[stops laughing and gasps]'' SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[stops laughing like Squidward]'' Huh? ''[avoids tree with scuba diving gear on it]'' Don't worry, guys, everything is under control, 'cause I'm an... ''[hits a log and he goes off the mountain]'' Expert...! ''[suddenly stops in mid-air]'' Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down. ''[camera reveals that SpongeBob is upside down and not the mountain and he screams as he falls]''}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[makes himself right-side up and he takes off his pants]'' Like this?}}
{{L|Patrick|No, your other bottom!}}
{{L|Sandy|Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?}}
{{L|Patrick|Not until 4.}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob crashes into the ground and his bottom breaks into tiny pieces]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Ooh, that's gotta hurt.}}
{{L|Patrick|Do it again! I wasn't looking!}}
{{L|''[Cuts to the doctor's office]''}}
{{L|Doctor|Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My what has a what now?}}
{{L|Doctor|Your butt's all better. It's really quite amazing. ''[he turns on an X-ray]'' It took twenty hours to put it all back together. ''[he holds a stapler]'' We actually ran out of staples and had to use a glue stick ''[he holds a glue stick]''. Yep, you're a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, luck boy. But from now on, I'd like you to be more careful. One more injury like that and you could wind up like that poor creature there. ''[points to where the fish is]'' ''[we see Tom and his butt is in a giant machine]'' In the Iron Butt.}}
{{L|Tom|''[in the Iron Butt]'' Aww, man. It itches.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[outside hospital]'' You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol. ''[sees Harold behind him]'' Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you!}}
{{L|Harold|What's your problem? ''[leaves SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whew. That was close.}}
{{L|Football Player|Hey, SpongeBob, why don't you join us? We need an extra player. ''[another football player catches a football]'' Nice catch, Percy! ''[slaps Percy's bottom, SpongeBob cringes as he holds his butt]''}}
{{L|Jimmy|Hey, SpongeBob! ''[SpongeBob screams as he turns around, while holding his butt]'' You've gotta try this, dude! We finally got enough people for a seven-mile spanking machine! ''[crawls between people's legs, who each take turns spanking his butt]'' Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch.}}
{{L|Martin|Next.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No! ''[screams as he runs off. Everybody looks at him]''}}
{{L|Squidward|Is this where the line starts?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|My butt is not safe out here! ''[runs inside his house and closes the door]'' No part of me is safe! ''[closes the window curtain]''}}
{{L|''[Patrick and Sandy return from another trip from Sand Mountain]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy! ''[Patrick starts laughing as they enter SpongeBob's house]'' Hey, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[is still laughing while riding on Sandy's back; Sandy glares at him and he gets off her back as well as clearing his throat afterwards]'' That was fun. ''[he stops smiling]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[Patrick smiles again]'' Hey, SpongeBob, you ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob is sitting in a fetal position in the middle of the floor, with a penny, a potato chip, and a wadded-up napkin lying on the floor in front of him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[with a little smile on his face]'' Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world?}}
{{L|Sandy|Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again.}}
{{L|Sandy|That's crazy talk!}}
{{L|Patrick|That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk. ''[does various forms of gibberish blabbing, but his third blabbing makes his saliva hit Sandy, making her pound him to shut him up, bashing his head into his body]'' Sorry.}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead.}}
{{L|Patrick|Or your other armpit!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking… My people are sedentary.}} 
{{L|Sandy|Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny... ''[holds up a penny]'' and Chip... ''[holds up a potato chip]'' and say hello to Used Napkin. ''[holds up a used napkin]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Well, how are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No problem! ''[he grabs the end of a spatula, which is so long it stretches all the way inside the Krusty Krab]'' A really long spatula. ''[flips a patty with the really long spatula]''}}
{{L|Sandy|What about eating?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed. ''[breathes in a different and weird way]''}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go outside!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again.}}
{{L|Patrick|Never ever?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Never ever ever!}}
{{L|Patrick|Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Never ever never never ever ever never!!}}
{{L|Patrick|Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sighs exasperatedly]'' Never ever...}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Never never never never ever never ever never…}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door? ''[throws Chip to the door, opening it, and Patrick and an angry Sandy leave]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Thank you, Chip. ''[closes the door. Outside, Sandy is still glaring at SpongeBob]'' I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward!}}
{{L|Squidward|''[pops out of his window]'' No! ''[slams his window shut]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Aww!}}
{{L|Sandy|Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of.}}
{{L|Patrick|And that's when I ''[holds a boxing glove]'' punch him, right? ''[Sandy gives a bummed look. Patrick and Sandy are jellyfishing outside SpongeBob's house]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Look at all the jellyfish out here. Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[catches a jellyfish]'' I caught one! ''[puts head in net and his jellyfish sticks to his face]'' Huh?}} 
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Patrick gets electrocuted in the background, making him scream in pain]'' Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting. ''[puts on a pair of glasses and a tiny net and waves it in the air]'' I think I caught one!}}
{{L|Sandy|We've got to try something else!}}
{{L|''[Patrick and Sandy are holding a cake in front of SpongeBob's house]''}}
{{L|Sandy and Patrick|♪Three cheers on your birthday, SpongeBob! Three cheers for you!♪}}
{{L|Sandy|Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. ♪I know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors!♪ Take it away, Penny! ''[the penny lies silently on the floor]''}}
{{L|Patrick|''[sniffles]'' That penny has the most beautiful voice.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[goes inside the window to angrily point at a smiling SpongeBob]'' That is it, SquarePants! We're gonna find you something that's so dang fun that you'll have to come outside! ''[goes outside]''}}
{{L|Sandy|''[jumps on a trampoline]'' Trampoline!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[holds an ice cream cone]'' Ice cream.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[surfs on an underwater wave]'' Underwater surfing!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[holds two ice cream cones]'' Two ice creams.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[rides on a Ferris wheel]'' Ferris wheel!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[the two ice creams are melting]'' Still two ice creams.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[struggling with a giant clam]'' Clam wrestling!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[washes an old man in a tub]'' Washing an old person.}}
{{L|Sandy|Patrick, that's not fun.}}
{{L|Old man|It is for me!}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob is still "filter-feeding," and Sandy and Patrick watch him through his window]''}} 
{{L|Sandy|Nothing's working, Patrick!}} 
{{L|Patrick|What do we do?}}
{{L|Old man|''[appearing from below]'' I say we take a bath!}}
{{L|Sandy|Wha... will you get out of here?}}
{{L|''[Patrick and Sandy are hiding behind a coral bush and Patrick is in a gorilla suit]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Now remember. Don't jump out until I give the signal.}}
{{L|Patrick|Right. ''[he zips up his mask]''}} 
{{L|Sandy|''[opens the door]'' All right, SpongeBob. You win. Stay inside forever. Yours is truly the iron will. Now, Pat! ''[Patrick comes out in the gorilla suit and acts crazy like a gorilla]'' Eek! A gorilla! Save me, SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[Patrick continues dancing]'' No, really! You've got to come and save me! ''[Suddenly, a second Patrick shows up out of nowhere with an ice cream]''}}
{{L|Patrick #2|Hey, Sandy. ''[SpongeBob gives a startled look]'' Who's your friend?}}
{{L|Sandy|''[Confused]'' But--but you're supposed to be in the gorilla suit.}}{{L|Patrick #1|I am in the gorilla suit. ''[unzips the gorilla suit]'' I thought I was doing a pretty good job.}}
{{L|Sandy|If you're Patrick, then who's that? ''[The two look at second Patrick who unzips his head, which reveals a real gorilla underneath which scares them!]'' [gasps] A real gorilla!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Shocked]'' Huh? ''[The gorilla rips out of the Patrick suit it is wearing. Sandy and Patrick are screaming. The gorilla grabs the scared Patrick and Sandy, puts them in a bag, and repeatedly beats them]'' Oh, my gosh! ''[Sandy and Patrick are still screaming while the gorilla beats them]'' This can't be happening! ''[The gorilla hits Patrick and Sandy using a chair, then beating them some more]'' This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about! ''[the gorilla can be seen still beating up the sack outside the window; it also does things like dribbling the sack and bouncing on it like it's a ball]'' Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary.}}
{{L|Gary|''[eats Chip]'' Meow.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[looks behind]'' Well, here I go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world. ''[gulps and shakes as he reaches for the door. The door shakes as well until SpongeBob opens it]'' I'm taking my ''[walks slowly]'' first step. ''[continues walking]'' So far, so good. I think I can do this! ''[the wind blows a piece of paper onto his face; SpongeBob screams]'' Oh, dear Neptune, get off of me, get off of me! Chip! Help me, help me! ''[Squidward waters his plants and rolls his eyes and SpongeBob removes the paper off his face]'' I'm still alive! I did it! I made it outside! Nothing can stop me now! ''[the gorilla grabs SpongeBob]'' Is it too late to go back inside again? ''[the gorilla rips SpongeBob in half]''}}
{{L|1st half of SpongeBob|It's too late. ''[the gorilla screeches]'' Patrick? Sandy?}}
{{L|Patrick and Sandy|''[still in the bag]'' Yes, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|1st half of SpongeBob|I'm sorry I caused all this. I'm not scared of going outside anymore. ''[eye widens]'' But I'm terrified of gorillas now.}}
{{L|Sandy|''[shaken]'' Ah, that's okay, SpongeBob. Us too.}}
{{L|First half of SpongeBob|You know what I don't understand though? ''[moves to the second half of SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Second half of SpongeBob|What?}}
{{L|First half of SpongeBob|What's a gorilla doing underwater in the first place? ''[the gorilla's eyes widen once he realizes this]''}}
{{L|Gorilla|''[man's voice]'' Oh! Well, it's funny you should, I mean, you see, George, they're on to us! ''[A zebra rushes onto the screen]''}}
{{L|George|Let's get outta here! ''[the gorilla gets on George and rides away with him. Patrick, Sandy, and the two halves of SpongeBob are watching the gorilla ride on George into the sunset. Text reads: The End. The screen zooms out to reveal a live-action family watching the episode on TV in confusion. The father turns to the mother and gives her a confused look. He shakes his head, and eventually turns off the TV.]''}}
