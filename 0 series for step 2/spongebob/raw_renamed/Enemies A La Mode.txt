{{L|''[The episode begins at the Star House, where Patrick is spinning a large wheel}}
{{L|Patrick|Come on, wheel! Give me a good idea for my show! ''[He excitedly watches the wheel spin. It lands on "Eel Hats."]'' Eel hats? I guess we could do a fashion episode. ''[He puts an eel on his head that electrocutes him as he yells. The eel then jumps off of him]'' Yow! Well, that's no good. Who knew making TV shows would be harder than watching TV shows? ''[He spins the wheel again, but it spins off the hanger.]''}}
