{{L|Plankton|My evil genius video diary, by Sheldon J. Plankton.}}
{{L|''[Plankton appears in a video tape on a computer screen.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Greetings, it is I, Plankton! And there's something I gotta get off my chest. ''[The screen fuzzes to another part]'' I'm worried that my evil laugh isn't evil enough.}}
{{L|''[The screen fuzzes to another part. Plankton does his evil laugh then stops. The screen then fuzzes to another part.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|After all, everyone knows that an evil villain needs an exceptionally evil laugh. So, I've been working on a few new options. Ahem.}}
{{L|''[The screen fuzzes to another part. Plankton does his evil laugh again, but very gently.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|That's good, but I really want a wild one.}}
{{L|''[The screen fuzzes to another part. Plankton does his evil laugh again, this time he's laughing wildly. The screen then fuzzes to another part where he sits on a chair and eats popcorn.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Mmm. There might be something there, but let me try one more.}}
{{L|''[Plankton does his evil laugh again, but he does SpongeBob's laughter. Plankton spits out the popcorn.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Wow, that is annoying. Oh well, I guess I'll just keep practicing and we'll see who laughs last. a-Whoa!}}
{{L|''[Plankton loses his balance and falls into the chair. The laugh track is heard in the background and Plankton pops out of the chair.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Okay, that's not funny! You haven't heard the last of me!}}
