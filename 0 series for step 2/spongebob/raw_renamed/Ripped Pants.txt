{{L|''[Pan across Goo Lagoon]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|Ah, Goo Lagoon. A stinky mud puddle to you and me. But to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom, a wonderful, stinky mud puddle. ''[SpongeBob and Sandy sit enjoying the beach. SpongeBob sighs]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What a great day. ''[runs off]'' Hey, Sandy! Look! ''[now covered in a mound of sand]'' I'm Sandy! ''[Sandy laughs. SpongeBob forms sand around his head and nose to look like Squidward and imitates his voice]'' Hey Sandy, who am I? ''[Sandy still laughs. SpongeBob picks up a sand phone]'' Hello, SpongeBob. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. ''[Sandy continues laughing]''}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob! ''[a doorbell rings, SpongeBob walks in carrying sand pizza boxes and wearing a Krusty Krab sand hat]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? ''[he and Sandy laugh together. Larry walks up]''}}
{{L|Larry the Lobster|Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Sandy|Hey, Larry.}}
{{L|Larry|You guys wanna go lift some weights?}}
{{L|Sandy|Sure. ''[she and Larry walk off]'' Well, come on, SpongeBob. ''[SpongeBob's sand pizzas and hat fall flat as he walks on dejectedly]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[disappointingly]'' Coming. ''[cut to a group of weightlifters, each grunting as they work out. Larry turns to Sandy]''}}
{{L|Larry|Give it a try, Sandy. ''[Sandy stands in front of a weight. She picks it up, grunting as she does so. The crowd cheers for her, and she throws the weight down]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? ''[tries to walk off]''}}
{{L|Larry|How about a little more weight? ''[bends down to pick up a weight heavier than Sandy's]'' Observe. ''[grunts as he picks it up, his eyes bulging, and veins stick out from his neck. The crowd cheers, and Larry throws the weight down]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|All right, stand back, everyone. ''[picks up a single twig from the ground. The crowd is silent. He sinks into the sand. Sandy walks to a weight]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Y'all watch this! ''[picks up an anchor weight. The crowd cheers for her, but stop when they realize Larry has lifted the spectator stands]'' Way to go, Larry! ''[SpongeBob burrows into the sand, and tunnels over to Incidental 36 who is picnicking next to a marshmallow sack]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Could I borrow a couple of these?}}
{{L|Incidental 36|''[through his marshmallow-filled mouth]'' Mm-hmm. ''[crams another marshmallow into his mouth.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[takes two marshmallows and places them on the twig]'' And now, with the addition of 2, count 'em, 2 marshmallows. ''[preps himself for his lift, inhales deeply, takes hold of the twig, and is unable to lift it. The crowd isn't moved. He tries again. And again. After a huge effort, SpongeBob hears a rip. He looks down and notices that he's ripped his pants. The crowd gasps, then laughs at SpongeBob. SpongeBob scuttles off, embarrassed. Scooter walks over, laughing]''}}
{{L|Scooter|That was too funny. ''[slaps SpongeBob on the back]'' You are hilarious!}}
{{L|Sandy|Ain't he the funniest little Sponge you ever saw? ''[SpongeBob grins widely which gave him an idea. Cut to Larry with a volleyball on his claw]''}}
{{L|Larry|Anybody up for some volleyball? ''[the ball volleys back and forth, until Larry spikes it into some fish and the crowd cheers for him. SpongeBob looks at him in contempt. A fish serves the ball and as Larry is about to hit it, SpongeBob interferes]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I got it! ''[the ball falls and SpongeBob tries to serve it]'' Incoming! ''[the serve misses and the crowd boos. He bends down to pick the ball up and rips his pants]'' Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again! ''[the crowd laughs. Scooter walks in laughing again]''}}
{{L|Scooter|Once again, dude, ''[slaps SpongeBob on the back]'' you have split my sides! ''[he continues to laugh. Cut to a tossed Frisbee. Larry catches it and throws it to Sandy]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?}}
{{L|Sandy|Okay, here it comes! ''[SpongeBob stands still and lets the Frisbee hit him on the head, knocking him over]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I could use a hand here! ''[laughs. Sandy walks over and helps him up]''}}
{{L|Sandy|You okay, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I guess so... ''[does a handstand, revealing his pants]'' ...except I ripped my pants! ''[the crowd laughs, and Scooter walks up to SpongeBob once again]''}}
{{L|Scooter|You still got it, dude! ''[slaps SpongeBob on the back again. Cut to SpongeBob and Sandy walking to an ice cream vendor]''}}
{{L|Incidental 39|May I help you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'll take a banana split.}}
{{L|Incidental 39|Uh, we don't have that.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|That's okay. I already split my pants! Get it? ''[Sandy giggles]''}}
{{L|Incidental 39|''[annoyed]'' Tee-hee. Anything else?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|How about ripple? ''[does so, Sandy giggles again]'' No, thanks, already got one! ''[Sandy drops laughing, Incidental 39 is unamused, and SpongeBob happily bounces off to a snack bar. SpongeBob runs up to Incidental 40, knocking his drink over]'' Is that a burger you're eating?}}
{{L|Incidental 40|Why, yes, it is.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You know what would go good with that?}}
{{L|Incidental 40|No, what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[whispers]'' Ripped... pants. ''[smiles widely and shows the annoyed Incidental 40 his ripped pants. SpongeBob then runs around the snack bar, laughing. He comes up in-between two fish]'' Ripped pants a la mode! ''[rips his pants, the fish are annoyed. Cut to SpongeBob being in the kitchen of the snack bar, next to the fry cook]'' Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? ''[shoves his behind through the box, revealing his ripped pants, then laughs and the box is revealed to have no lower part. The fry cook groans disgustedly. Cut to a broadcasting booth over looking the lagoon]''}}
{{L|Sports guy|Surf's up in the Goo Lagoon. ''[fish are surfing. Close-up of Perch Perkins]'' And here comes Larry, doing his trademark lay-back. ''[cut to Larry lying on his surfboard]'' There goes Sandy, hanging ten... fingers, that is. ''[cut to Sandy doing a handstand on her surfboard]'' There goes SpongeBob... ''[rip]'' ripping his pants again. ''[The sports guy is annoyed, then cut to SpongeBob ripping his pants on his surfboard. A wave knocks SpongeBob off his surfboard and washes him up on the beach]''}}
{{L|Incidental 155|Hey, look! A cardboard box washed up on the beach. ''[takes a closer look through his telescope]'' Holy fish paste! It's a guy! ''[sprints over to SpongeBob and flips him over]'' Why?! Why?! WHY?! ''[a crowd gathers around SpongeBob and Incidental 155]''}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[to Incidental 155]'' Come closer. ''[a divine light shines on him]'' I need... I need...}}
{{L|Incidental 155|What do you need? ''[tears come to Incidental 155's and Sandy's eyes]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[pats Incidental 155 on the shoulder. Close up of SpongeBob's mouth]'' A tailor. ''[the light turns off, accompanied by a light switch]'' Because I ripped my pants! ''[laughs. Incidental 155 makes an annoyed expression, drops SpongeBob, and the crowd surrounding him walks off with annoyance. SpongeBob is left alone and Sandy walks up to him angry]''}}
{{L|Sandy|That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! Y'all had me worried sick!'' [walks off as Scooter walks towards SpongeBob and looks at him sadly]''}}
{{L|Scooter|''[shakes his head]'' Dude... ''[walks off. Cut to a dressing tent, with SpongeBob inside]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[thinking]'' Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think! Your public's waiting. ''[speaking]'' Let's see... ''[checking them off a list]'' "Lifting weights - big laugh," "Frisbee in face - kills," "Surfing - knocks 'em dead," "Pretending to drown," ''[uses his pencil to write the word "NO" and circle it]'' No. Come on, think! I got it! Hey, everybody! ''[runs out of the dressing tent]'' Not ripped pants! ''[tears his pants off]'' Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose! ''[the wind howls, SpongeBob standing alone on the beach. A tumbleweed rolls by. SpongeBob turns and hears party music at a distance, and sees Larry and Sandy playing volleyball]'' Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no. ''[lies on the beach as he continues saying, no]'' We blew it, pants. ''[throws his pants aside]''}}
{{L|Pants|What do you mean, "we?" ''[the pants walk off, leaving SpongeBob alone]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! ''[Incidental 22 walks up to SpongeBob, shining red]''}}
{{L|Incidental 22|No, I am. I forgot to put on sunscreen. ''[places a fin on herself, and it leaves a sounding mark, which vanishes]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ouch. ''[a fish walks up to the two]''}}
{{L|Loser|No, I am. I got sand in my buns. ''[shows them two sandy hamburger buns. There is a rumbling coming from the sand and a whale pops his head out of the sand]''}}
{{L|Frank|No, I'm the biggest loser on the beach. They buried me in the sand and forgot me.}}
{{L|All|What happened to you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I lost my best friend.}}
{{L|All|How? ''[SpongeBob grabs a sand guitar and sings he is front of the sand castle and a sand telephone he built earlier]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|When I ripped... ''[his underwear starts ripping]'' my pants. ''[starts to sing]'' I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, [The curtain comes down and a spotlight shines on SpongeBob]  all just because I ''[rips his underwear again]'' ripped my pants. ''[the other three "losers of the beach" assemble on a sand stage with sand instruments and sing]''}}
{{L|All|♪When big Larry came round just to put him down, SpongeBob turned into a clown, and no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and ''[Incidental 22 turns around and suddenly, her bottom then rips, splitting open, revealing her white underwear]'' ripped his pants!♪}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[singing voice, a crowd begins to gather]'' ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪}}
{{L|All|♪Or sand in your buns!♪ ''[instrumental break. The loser scrapes the two buns together to make a rhythm then the curtain shows waves crashing about]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ ''[the whole group comes together one by one in sync with the music and they rip their pants. By now, a huge crowd has gathered and is cheering the group onstage. A blimp flies by with SpongeBob's name on it. It's revealed that SpongeBob and his band were having a concert.]''}}
{{L|Sandy|SpongeBob!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sandy! ''[she gets onstage and hugs SpongeBob. He returns the embrace]''}}
{{L|Sandy|Your song is true. If y'all want to be my friend, just be yourself. ''[Larry walks up]''}}
{{L|Larry|''[impressed with SpongeBob's singing during the big concert]'' SpongeBob, that was so righteous. ''[hands SpongeBob a pencil]''  Would you... sign my pants?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Absolutely, buddy. ''[SpongeBob bends down to sign Larry's pants. His underwear then rips off completely, leaving SpongeBob "au naturel." Someone off-screen whistles. SpongeBob covers his crotch, grins, and blushes sheepishly]''}}
