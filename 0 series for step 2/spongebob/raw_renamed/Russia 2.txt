{{L|SpongeBob|Russia is famous for its nesting dolls, also known as matryoshka dolls. Each one has a series of smaller dolls hidden inside it.}}
{{L|Patrick|It is what's inside that counts.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, that is so true.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[laughs]'' I wish I had a little sea star inside of me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|True that, brother.}}
{{L|''[A photo of SpongeBob and Patrick standing next to a bear revealed to be named Teddy.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The bear is a wide spread symbol for Russia. So, we were excited to meet one here. His name is Teddy. He's kind of shy. Didn't really like us taking his picture.}}
{{L|Patrick|And wasn't much of a cuddler either.}}
{{L|''[A photo of SpongeBob and Patrick dancing with some ballet dancers.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Russia is also known for having some of the most talented ballet dancers in the world.}}
{{L|Patrick|I would make a bad ballet dancer because I can't stand on my toes.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, you don't have toes.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh! What?}}
