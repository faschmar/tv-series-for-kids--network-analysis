{{L|SpongeBob|Here are the colorful boats that travel the canals in Xochimilco.}}
{{L|Patrick|Uh, bless you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, Patrick, I said, "Xochimilco," not... ''[Sneezes]'' We learned that in Mexico, instead of Halloween, they celebrate d√≠a de los Muertos.}}
{{L|Patrick|This Halloween, I'm gonna dress up like Patrick.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Uh, but, Patrick, you are Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|That's why they'll never know it's me. ''[Chuckles]'' It's brilliant!}}
