{{EpisodeTranscript}} {{L|''[The episode begins with Bikini Bottom news.]''}} 
{{L|Johnny Elaine|This is a Bikini Bottom News special report. ''[the screen shows Perch Perkins at the Bikini Bottom power plant with the police]'' Perch?}}
{{L|Perch Perkins|Perch Perkins here at the Bikini Bottom power plant, where the evil supervillain known as the Dirty Bubble has finally been cornered by police!}}
{{L|''[The Dirty Bubble is at the very top of the power plant, holding the police chief hostage.]''}} 
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Stand back, coppers, and cease your attack, or I'll make your police chief my late night snack! ''[laughs and holds the chief in the air with his tongue]''}} 
{{L|Police chief|Do what he says! ''[groans as the Dirty Bubble squeezes him tighter]''}} 
{{L|Perch Perkins|''[appears from the left]'' Will the grime of this evil soap globe wash over our fair city? Or will the law force him to clean up his act?}} 
{{L|Dirty Bubble|''[releases the police chief and grabs Perch]'' Or will he choose door number three, and devour a newsman live on TV? ''[laughs as he goes to eat Perch]''}} 
{{L|''[Just then, three officers seize the Dirty Bubble with giant bubble wands.]''}} 
{{L|Officer Slugfish|Drop him, airhead!}} 
{{L|''[The officers force the Dirty Bubble to let Perch go.]''}} 
{{L|Perch Perkins|Yike! ''[falls off-screen]''}} 
{{L|Officer Johnson|''[grunts while seizing the Dirty Bubble]'' I got him!}} 
{{L|''[The officers shove the Dirty Bubble into the bottle.]''}} 
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Remember this face and remember it well, so you'll recognize me when I see you in—''[gets pushed into the bottle by the chief]''}} 
{{L|Police chief|Jail!}} 
{{L|''[The Dirty Bubble, still in the bottle, is placed in a prison cell in Bikini Bottom Jail.]''}} 
{{L|Johnny|Six months later...}} 
{{L|''[Two men carry the bottle containing the dirty bubble inside. One man opens the bottle, takes out the bubble wand, dips it into the liquid and blows out the Dirty Bubble, now sparky clean and reformed.]''}} 
{{L|Clean Bubble|Thank you, warden. I feel like a new bubble. ''[laughs]''}} 
{{L|Warden|Remember, Bubble, keep it clean, or you'll get mean. ''[gives the Clean Bubble a handshake]''}} 
{{L|Clean Bubble|Thank you, warden. I promise I won't let you down! ''[puts on his hat]''}} 
{{L|Warden|''[holds out a paper with KK on it]'' Here's the address of your new job. ''[gives the paper to the Clean Bubble and blows him away with a fan]''}}
{{L|Clean Bubble|I'll make you proud, warden. Stay clean or you'll get mean. A new life. No more dirt, and no more wrong turns. ''[crashes into the Krusty Krab sign]'' The Krusty Krab. Hm, this must be the place! ''[enters the restaurant and gives a friendly handshake to Mr. Krabs]'' Oh, I can't thank you enough for this job, Mr. Krabs. What would you like me to do? ''[slams his face into the glass doors]'' Greet people at the door? Serve the food?}} 
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, no. I've got a special job that need someone with your special talents. You're on dirty dish detail.}} 
{{L|Clean Bubble|''[gets real nervous when he sees a pile of dirty dishes]'' D-d-d-d-dirty dishes? Wait, couldn't I just work the cash register or something?}} 
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Listen, I hired a dish-washing bubble to save money on soap, and I want these plates sparkling by lunchtime, savvy?}} 
{{L|Clean Bubble|Just call me Sparkles.}} 
{{L|''[The Clean Bubble becomes nervous and looks at the dirty dishes. One drop of slime nearly hits the Clean Bubble.]''}} 
{{L|Clean Bubble|''[sweating]'' Stay clean, or you'll get mean. Stay clean, or you'll get mean.}}
{{L|''[Pans screen to the right, to reveal what appears to be a walking stack of frozen Krabby Patties coming out of the freezer.]''}}
{{L|Clean Bubble|Ah?}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob removes all the frozen Krabby Patties from himself and places them onto the grill]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Yeah. ''[shivers]'' Brr! Is there a blizzard coming in, 'cause I've got a cold front. ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Clean Bubble|''[laughs with SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, hi! I didn't see you there, you must be the new dishwasher. Welcome aboard! I'm SpongeBob.}}
{{L|Clean Bubble|Hi, SpongeBob, I'm, uh... DB, uh... DB.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, we're gonna have so much fun, DB. ''[gasps]'' We'll be galley pallies!}}
{{L|''[Squidward rings the desk bell multiple times]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Whoops. ''[grabs spatula from his hat]'' Back to work! ''[flips patties while singing to self]''}}
{{L|Clean Bubble|''[shudders]'' Keep it clean, or you'll get mean. ''[cleaning a dirty dish]'' Keep it clean, or you'll get mean!}}
{{L|''[Dish is sparkling clean. Clean Bubble gasps.]''}}
{{L|Clean Bubble|Huh. Hey, I did it! I got dirty and I didn't turn evil! Huh, I must be cured!}}
{{L|''[Clean Bubble continuously cleans the dirty dishes with his body, while beginning to turn evil.]''}}
{{L|Clean Bubble|Scraping up filth, from between every crack! ''[transforms to the Dirty Bubble]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|I'm the Dirty Bubble, and, baby, I'm back! ''[evil laugh]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, what can I get you, Dirty Bubble? ''[Whistles while flipping a patty. Suddenly turns back surprised. Screams.]''}}

{{L|SpongeBob|What did you do with DB? ''[Sobs. Looks at the newly transformed Clean Bubble.]''}}
{{L|''[Clean Bubble glows and smiles]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|DB is short for Dirty Bubble, isn't it?}}

{{L|SpongeBob|Wow, a supervillain intervention! I'll help you, DB. I'll make sure you stay squeaky clean and dirt-free! ''[offers a handshake]''}}
{{L|''[Clean Bubble happily offers a handshake]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[comes from the right with an electric fan, blowing away the Clean Bubble and SpongeBob]'' Attention, Mr. Bubble, I've got another job for you!}}

{{L|''[The Dirty Bubble appears yet again in another comic frame where he spits out a fountain of mud onto a bus "White Suit Society" while the fish of the bus scream and panic. SpongeBob comes in surfing and washes the Dirty Bubble down. The Clean Bubble comes on the surfboard]''}}
{{L|''[Transition to the Krusty Krab. Squidward is sleeping at the cash register area, while SpongeBob mops the floor. The Clean Bubble comes in to serve a tray of three Krabby Patties and two drinks, while whistling.]''}}
