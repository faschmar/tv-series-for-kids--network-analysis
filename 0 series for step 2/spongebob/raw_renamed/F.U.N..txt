{{L|French Narrator|Ahh, lunchtime at the Krusty Krab. Everyone is enjoying their Krabby Patties. ''[lights go off and sirens and red lights blare as everyone in the Krusty Krab screams and runs for cover]'' Huh?! What's this? ''[doors and windows are now metal]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?}}
{{L|Squidward|''[up in a crows nest with a telescope]'' Down there, sir! ''[a Krabby Patty is bouncing to the door]''}}
{{L|French Narrator|''[gasps]'' There appears to be a Krabby Patty napping in progress! ''[Krabby Patty shoots a laser hole big enough for it to go through at the door]'' There can only be one culprit: Plankton!}}
{{L|Plankton|Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win! ''[laughs]''}}
{{L|Squidward|He got away, sir.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[devastated]'' No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!}}
{{L|French Narrator|Perhaps not, Monsieur Krabs, for it's... ''[SpongeBob tears himself into another SpongeBob and flies off]'' ...SpongeBob SquarePants! ''[later, SpongeBob peeks out through under the sewer with binoculars in his hand. Catches a peek at a Krabby Patty jumping through the crowd]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|A-ha! ''[chases it behind some buildings]'' Hey! ''[Plankton flies up with a propeller. SpongeBob takes the twirling club that Incidental 118 is using as a propeller and flies after the Krabby Patty to the top of a building]'' Okay, that's far enough! Huh? ''[patty jumps off building]'' Tartar sauce! ''[uses his hat as a balloon-like ball and jumps off the building. Bounces off the ground towards the Krabby Patty. Bounces past a cowboy and a cowgirl]''}}
{{L|Cowboy|Yeehaw! ''[Plankton walks into a magic shop and comes back out with funny glasses on]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and... ''[looks up and reads the sign MAGIC SHOP]'' Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, "If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true." ''[Plankton takes away Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Argh! I can't take it!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Plankton! It's you!}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes! And after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that... that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser. ''[cries]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[stops crying]'' Wh-what did you say?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I said, you're a-- ''[a bunch of people run up and point at Plankton]''}}
{{L|All|Loser! ''[Plankton jumps away from group and walks back to his restaurant]''}}
{{L|Squidward|How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?! I know!}}
{{L|Incidental 118|Yeah, and for running you out, we're going to make this kid honorary town rookie of the day. ''[puts a big donut with a ribbon on it around SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|All|♪For he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie...♪}}
{{L|''[Everyone throws SpongeBob into the air.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[thinking to himself]'' I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie.}}
{{L|All|''[as SpongeBob comes down, they stop singing]'' Which no... whatever. ''[everyone walks away. Later, Plankton hears a knock on his door at his restaurant]''}}
{{L|Plankton|A customer? ''[opens door]'' Our special today is chum... ''[sees SpongeBob at the door]'' ...balaya.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hi, Mr. Plankton.}}
{{L|Plankton|Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.}}
{{L|Plankton|What?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Play with me.}}
{{L|Plankton|You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, but I like to go jelly... ''[Plankton closes the door]''}}
{{L|Plankton|That naïve cube! How long must I suffer this?}}
{{L|Karen|You're not letting him leave, are you? Can't you see? This is the perfect opportunity for revenge!}}
{{L|Plankton|Elaborate. ''[computer shows images of a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob]''}}
{{L|Karen|Befriend the SpongeBob, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!}}
{{L|Plankton|Take the Krabby Patty? ''[runs back to the door]''}}
{{L|Karen|Get moving, genius, don't let him get away.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[Plankton opens the door]''  ...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.}}
{{L|Plankton|Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Great! ''[SpongeBob grabs Plankton and runs off]'' Last one to the fields is a rotten clam! ''[now at Jellyfish Fields]'' So, I get the big net and you get the little net. ''[hands Plankton a net bigger than him]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What happens after we eat 'em?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this! ''[captures a jellyfish]'' Like that.}}
{{L|Plankton|And?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!}}
{{L|Plankton|Stingers? ''[Plankton imagines ruling Bikini Bottom with a jellyfish that only he controls]'' All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win! ''[end of fantasy while laughing]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|It's not about winning, it's about fun!}}
{{L|Plankton|What's that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪}}
{{L|Clams|♪Down here in the deep blue sea.♪}}
{{L|Plankton|♪F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you-♪}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this: ♪F is for friends who do stuff to-♪}}
{{L|Plankton|Never! That's completely idiotic!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Here, let me help you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.♪ Try it!}}
{{L|Plankton|♪N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪}}
{{L|Clams|♪Down here in the deep blue sea!♪}}
{{L|Plankton|Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No! That's how you're suppose to feel!}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, I like it. Let's do it again!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Plankton|♪F is for frolic through all the flowers, U is for ukulele. N is nose-picking, sharing gum, and sand-licking, here with my best buddy. Hahahahahahahaha!♪}}
{{L|''[At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is looking through a telescope at SpongeBob and Plankton]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Arrgh, mutiny.}}
{{L|''[At the Chum Bucket at night, Plankton is changing clothes.]''}}
{{L|Plankton|And after that, we frolicked through the flowers, and then we...}}
{{L|Karen|Sounds like fun.}}
{{L|Plankton|Well, the really fun part was when we...}}
{{L|Karen|What did you do with the Krabby Patty?}}
{{L|Plankton|The what? ''[shows a Krabby Patty on Karen's computer screen]''}}
{{L|Karen|The Krabby Patty, remember?}}
{{L|Plankton|You can't rush these things, you know.}}
{{L|Karen|You're forgetting the mission! ''[shows a formula]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What are you talking about?}}
{{L|Karen|You're going native, Plankton! Look at yourself! ''[metal arm picks up Plankton and shows him wearing square pants like SpongeBob's]''}}
{{L|Plankton|What?}}
{{L|''[cuts to Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Who knows? Maybe he's changed.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Who knows? I think you knows! ''[shows a picture of him and Plankton holding up the letters for FUN]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|He's changed, I tell you! ''[Plankton enters]''}}
{{L|Plankton|SpongeBuddy! Yoo-hoo! ''[SpongeBob runs over to Plankton]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private. ''[talking to Plankton]'' You won't mind if I set this here, will you? ''[puts a plate with a Krabby Patty on the table and pushes it toward him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Why can't you just accept our friendship?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you. ''[walks up to Plankton]'' Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.}}
{{L|Plankton|Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Uhh... suit yourself. ''[walks off then comes back to push the plate closer to Plankton. Uses a fan to get the smell to Plankton]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs! ''[turns the fan off]'' Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here. ''[both walk away]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight. ''[plate falls down revealing that it was cardboard]'' And maybe scallops will fly out of my pants! ''[takes the boat and paddles to 'The Reef']'' Hang on there, laddie, I'm a-comin! ''[at 'The Reef' movie theater, SpongeBob and Plankton are sitting in the front row. SpongeBob is giving popcorn to Plankton as he is eating some himself. Then Bubble Bass comes down and sits on Plankton, squishing him]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I sure like sequels, Plankton. ''[sees Bubble Bass in his spot]'' Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend. ''[Bubble Bass meanly smiles and gets comfortable in his seat, and a squelching sound comes from Plankton being squashed by his butt]'' Hey, Bubble Bass! ''[throws some popcorn and Bubble Bass runs after it]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Thanks for that, friend.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sure thing.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Listen up! ''[Mr. Krabs' shadow is on the movie screen]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs? ''[in the projector room]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got! ''[Everyone in the theater steals an item from the pocket of whoever is sitting next to them]'' You too, boy! ''[SpongeBob reaches into Plankton's pocket and takes out a Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[gasps]'' I can't believe this!}}
{{L|Plankton|It's not what you think.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What is it then? Tell me what you see here!}}
{{L|Plankton|I... I don't see anything.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[starting to cry]'' How can you not see it!? ''[groans]''}}
{{L|Plankton|''[beginning to tear up as well]'' Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay? I couldn't help it.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But we sang the F.U.N. Song! ''[clutches his stomach]'' I think I'm gonna be sick. How long?}}
{{L|Plankton|How long what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[grabs Plankton, holding him in his fist]'' How long were you planning on doing this?! ''[tears well up in SpongeBob's eyes]'' Tell me!}}
{{L|''[Plankton puts his head down and begins to sob.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[the tears now dripping down his face]'' What?!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[looks up at SpongeBob]'' All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship! ''[the two look each other in the eyes]'' And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[sniffs, then smiles, beginning to stop crying]'' Really?}}
{{L|Plankton|''[Plankton grabs the patty and jumps towards the screen]'' No, not really. Being evil is too much fun! ''[laughs evilly]''}}
{{L|Movie Woman|Oh, darling, I knew nothing would ever tear us apart. ''[Plankton rips through the movie screen]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know what’s behind these screens? Solid concrete! ''[laughs. Plankton is squished on the wall groaning. Mr. Krabs takes the Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Well, maybe on a discount. ''[Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton off the wall and onto Bubble Bass' jelly beans]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Huh? ''[Plankton runs around Bubble Bass' hand getting chased by his other hand, being mistaken for a jelly bean]''}}
