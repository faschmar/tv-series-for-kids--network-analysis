{{L|Narrator|The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. ''[we see a long line to the Krusty Krab]'' In a familiar restaurant, in a familiar part of town, a call goes out in frustration.}}
{{L|Frank|Will you hurry up?}}
{{L|Narrator|A call that would normally be answered by Bikini Bottom's semi-retired champions... ''if'' they weren't the ones causing the problem.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Let's see... I want a... no. ''[shows a brief shot of Krusty Krab Menu]'' I want a... ''[camera returns to Mermaid Man]'' uh, no, uh, hmm...}}
{{L|Squidward|Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[whispers in Mermaid Man's ear]'' Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|I've made my decision!}}
{{L|Line of customers|Hooray!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|One Krabby Patty for me and a Pipsqueak Patty for the boy.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Now, wait just a darn minute!}}
{{L|Line of customers|Aww!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty! I want an adult size Krabby Patty!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|The Krabby Patty is too big for you. You'll never finish it.}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Don't you see what you're doing? You're treating me like a child!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|The boyâ€™s eyes are bigger than his stomach.}}     ''[Everyone starts laughing]''{{L|Barnacle Boy|And that's another thing, I'm not a boy! I'm so old I got hairs growing out of the wrinkles on my liver spots. ''[removes his hat to show a hair popping out on the wrinkles of his liver spots]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[snickers]'' One Pipsqueak patty... ''[close up of the patty. He shows a bib and a highchair]'' and your bib and highchair.}}     ''[Everyone laughs again]''{{L|Barnacle Boy|I'm 68 years old and I want a Krabby Patty!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Your Pipsqueak is getting cold. Shall I feed you?}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|Feed this, old man! ''[slaps the Krabby Patty out of Mermaid Man's hand]''}}
{{L|All except Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy|Ooh!}}
{{L|Barnacle Boy|I'm tired of playing second banana to a man who wears a bra! From now on, I want to be called Barnacle Man! And, I'm through with protecting citizens that don't respect me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I respect you, Barnacle Man!}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|That's Barnacle Boy, I mean, Man! I... Ohh... forget you people. I say if you're not going to give me any respect as a hero, then maybe you'll give me respect as a villain. A villain who is... ''[the sky turns orange as thunderstorms are heard]'' evil!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Evil?}}
{{L|Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, and Patrick|Evil? ''[Mermaid Man zones out, so Mr. Krabs slaps him.]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Evil!}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|I'm crossing over... to the dark side! ''[points to dark side of Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Why should I waste money lighting the whole store? ''[villain car comes in, shows brief shot of License Plate (MEAN 2 U), then the window opens revealing Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble in the car.]''}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Did someone say evil?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble! ''[Barnacle Man gets in the villain car]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|Nighty night, you old goat! ''[the villain car departs]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Nighty-night! ''[to Squidward]'' Will you tuck me in? ''[Squidward narrows his eyes]''}}
{{L|Realistic Fish Head|We interrupt your bleak and meaningless lives for this special news break. ''[Man Ray zaps a building]'' Man Ray, ''[Dirty Bubble grabs a local bank while snickering]'' the Dirty Bubble, and now, playing for the dark side, Barnacle Boy...}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|Barnacle Man!}}
{{L|Realistic Fish Head|...have been committing a series of crimes throughout Bikini Bottom. ''[shows Man Ray, the Dirty Bubble, and Barnacle Man ding-dong-ditching and snickering]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|Shh! ''[rings the doorbell and run off, while laughing]''}}
{{L|Senior Citizen|''[opens door]'' I'll get you crazy kids!}}
{{L|Realistic Fish Head|These three have named their new alliance: ''[their logo is shown]'' Every Villain Is Lemons, otherwise known as E.V.I.L.! What can we do? When will this crime wave end? How will we defeat the evil? Why am I asking ''you'' all these questions? Mermaid Man, where are you? ''[Mermaid Man zones out again, so Mr. Krabs slaps him again]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Huh? I'm right here! Don't worry, good citizens! Nothing will stop me from defeating the E.V.I.L.! ''[runs outside]'' Nothing! ''[ice cream truck sounds]'' Ice cream? I love ice cream! A double scoop of prune with bran sprinkles. ''[he receives an ice cream with a lit fuse]'' Mmm. ''[MM licks it and takes a big bite but explodes, "KA-BRAN!" appears, leaving a hole in his stomach]'' Goes right through me every time.}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|''[E.V.I.L. is shown as ice cream men]'' You might as well give up, Mermaid Man. There's three of us and only one of you. You don't stand a chance. ''[drives off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[runs to Mermaid Man with Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward]'' Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|You're right. ''[sits down]'' I give up.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You can't give up. What if we help you?}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|No, no, that's a terrible idea. But what if you help me?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Okay!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Who wants to save the world?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I do!}}
{{L|Sandy|I do!}}
{{L|Patrick|I do!}}
{{L|Squidward|I don't.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[confronts Squidward]'' Oh, yes, you do! No world means no money! Now, go save the world, or you're fired! ''[runs back to the Krusty Krab; Squidward grumbles]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Then it's settled! To the Mermalair! ''[Transition to the Mermalair]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! The Mermalair!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|These costumes belonged to the original International Justice League of Super Acquaintances!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Once you put on these costumes, their fantastic powers will become yours!}}
{{L|Sandy|Wow! I didn't think super powers worked that way.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Sure! Power's all in the costume! Why else would we run around in colored undies?}}
{{L|Squidward|I can think of three good reasons.}}
{{L|Narrator|''[SpongeBob is running at lightning fast speed in his costume]'' The Quickster... with the uncanny ability to run really... quick!}}
{{L|The Quickster|Want to see me run to that mountain and back? ''[doesn't move]'' You want to see me do it again?}}
{{L|Narrator|''[Squidward is wearing his costume]'' Captain Magma... get him angry and he's bound to erupt!}}
{{L|Captain Magma|Krakatoa! ''[lava shoots out, licks his hand, then puts his thumb on his rear, while making a sizzling sound]''}}
{{L|Narrator|The Elastic Waistband... able to stretch his body into fantastic shapes and forms! ''[Patrick, in his costume, stretches his whole body really long]''}}
{{L|The Elastic Waistband|I can finally touch my toes! ''[stretches his toes over the back of his body and to his hands]''}}
{{L|Narrator|And Miss Appear... now you see her... ''[Sandy disappears in her costume]'' now you don't.}}
{{L|Miss Appear|Does this outfit make me look fat?}}
{{L|Narrator|The International Justice League of Super Acquaintances! A subsidiary of Viacom.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|So, it's agreed. We'll get one cheese pizza, one with pepperoni and mushrooms, and one with olives.}}
{{L|Chief|Super Acquaintances, we need your help.}}
{{L|The Quickster|Holy halibut! It's the chief!}}
{{L|Chief|Thank you for the introduction, Quickster, but we all know who I am! More to the point, we've got news on the whereabouts of E.V.I.L.}}
{{L|The Elastic Waistband|The whose-abouts of what?}}
{{L|Miss Appear|You just tell us where they are, Chief, and we'll hog-tie 'em faster than you can say "Salsa Verde."}}
{{L|Chief|Our sources last found E.V.I.L. harassing teenagers up at "Make-Out Reef." You know, Make-Out Reef? ''[makes out with himself]'' Whoo hoo hoo!}}
{{L|The Quickster|Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Those fiends! Attacking hormonally stressed-out children!}}
{{L|Captain Magma|Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|To Make-Out Reef, ''[chair falls backwards]'' away!}}
{{L|The Elastic Waistband|Does this mean we're not getting pizza? ''[scene cuts to Make-Out Reef at night. E.V.I.L. is pointing a flashlight at two fish]''}}
{{L|John & Nancy|Stop, please!}}
{{L|E.V.I.L.|John and Nancy, sittin' in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Oh! ''[points at a car]'' Shine the flashlight in that car, Man Ray!}}
{{L|Man Ray|Haha, with pleasure! ''[shines on a guy making out with a pillow]''}}
{{L|Sandals|Hey man, that's not cool. ''[E.V.I.L. snickers until Mermaid Man appears]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Leave those young lovers alone!}}
{{L|Man Ray|Well, if it isn't Milk Maid Man! You've saved us the trouble of tracking you down!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|You fiends can't win! You're outnumbered!}}
{{L|Man Ray|You senile bag of fish paste! There are three of us and only one of you!}}
{{L|The Quickster|''[runs up at super fast speed from behind and stops next to Mermaid Man]'' Make that two!}}
{{L|Man Ray|The Quickster!}}
{{L|Captain Magma|''[blasts up and flies like a rocket over the villains and joins the two heroes]'' Three!}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|Captain Magma!}}
{{L|The Elastic Waistband|''[stretches far from behind and joins the three heroes]'' Four!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|The Elastic Waistband!}}
{{L|Miss Appear|''[appears next to the group of heroes]'' Five!}}
{{L|E.V.I.L.|M-M-Miss Appear!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|And me makes ten, I think.}}
{{L|Man Ray|Uh-oh.}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|I don't have a good feeling about this.}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|Oh, there goes our toy deal.}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Super Acquaintances, attack!}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|Oh no, please, mercy!}}
{{L|Captain Magma|Krakatoa! ''[lava shoots out onto The Quickster]''}}
{{L|The Quickster|Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off! ''[starts running in a circle fast]'' Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!}}
{{L|The Elastic Waistband|I'll save you, Quickster! ''[stretches his arms to try and save Quickster, but ends up getting caught, and flies out with his arms overstretched. The villains look at each other in confusion]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|I'll cool you off, Quickster, with one of my water balls! ''[creates a water ball with his hands and concentrates, but targets Captain Magma instead]'' Aha!}}
{{L|Captain Magma|Huh?! No, no, no, I'm not the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag... ''[gets hit by the water ball]'' ma. ''[coughs, then melts to pile of ash]''}}
{{L|Miss Appear|Well, I guess it's up to me! ''[turns invisible and walks, only her footprints show in the ground]'' I'll sneak over... unseen... and catch them by surprise. ''[a boat hits her, sending her through the sign and to the cliff, while still invisible]'' ''[yelling and lands on the ground]''}}
{{L|The Quickster|Get it off! Get it off! ''[eventually stops, but only shown as shoes]'' Whew, glad that's over.}}
{{L|''[villains look at fallen heroes and Mermaid Man just falls backwards]''}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|We...We did it. We won! This day belongs to E.V.I.L.! ''[approaches the fallen Mermaid Man as he laughs maniacally]'' You've lost, Mermaid Man, and the superhero and super-villain rules say you have to give in to my demands!}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Okay, what do you want?}}
{{L|Man Ray|World domination! Tell him we want world domination!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Oh, and make him eat dirt! Ha! ''[Man Ray stares at him questioningly]'' In addition to the... domination thing.}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|Number one--I want to be treated like a superhero, not a sidekick. Number two--I want to be called Barnacle Man. And number three--}}
{{L|Man Ray|Come on, domination!}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|...I want an adult-sized Krabby Patty.}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|''[he and Man Ray are shocked]'' Did you hear him say anything about eating dirt?}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|Need a hand, superpal? ''[both start to get tears in their eyes as they grab and shake hands. "FRIEND" appears]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|Good to have you back on the side of justice, Kyle. Let's go get you that Krabby Patty! ''[leaves with Barnacle Boy]'' }}
{{L|Man Ray|Was that it? ''[groans in disgust]'' That's sickening!}}
{{L|Dirty Bubble|Oh, this reminds me of the time I went to Cancun with the Killer Shrimp. Oh, they had these papaya drinks that were to die for!}}
{{L|Man Ray|''[while Dirty Bubble is talking]'' Oh, Neptune, shut up! ''[at the Krusty Krab. Barnacle Boy is eating an adult-sized Krabby Patty]''}}
{{L|Mermaid Man|How is that adult-sized Krabby Patty treating you, Barnacle ''[winks]'' Man?}}
{{L|Barnacle Man|Actually, it's pretty big. I'm not sure if I can finish the whole thing. ''[Mermaid Man laughs, then Barnacle Boy laughs, SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward come in, all injured and laughing. The guy at make-out reef who was kissing the pillow is laughing, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble are in jail, laughing, and the chief is making out with himself; he turns around and laughs hysterically.]''}}
