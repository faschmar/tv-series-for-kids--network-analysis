{{L|SpongeBob|The Story of ''[SpongeBob's pants pull down]'' King Neptune. ''[switches to story]'' When King Neptune was a little Neptune, his mother sent him adrift in a river. As he floated along, a giant meteor fell on Earth. An alien appeared, and inflicted the baby with Super Neptune Fluid. ''[alien squirts King Neptune]'' By the time he was in school, he had already begun exhibiting signs of super-duperness. As an adult, he would fly through the sea, helping people, and getting snails off of sea-trees. ''[King Neptune gives snail to an elderly fish]''}}
