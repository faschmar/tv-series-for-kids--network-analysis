{{L|''[in Jellyfish Fields]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Breaker, breaker outer perimeter, looks clear. Over.}}
{{L|Patrick|Robert, Robert... uhh... Ronald, Ronald, Ryan.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Are you sure you're not trying to say Roger?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, wait, I got it. Ringo...}}
{{L|''[SpongeBob sees jellyfish.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, we have visual contact. Now taking evasive action. Subject still in close proximity. Over.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hello?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Please reply.}}
{{L|Patrick|I wonder if I can order pizza with these things.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Please, contact immanent Patrick. Respond now. Please. Please!}}
{{L|Patrick|SpongeBob, you're gonna need to speak up. My eardrums aren't what they used to be.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I can't speak up Patrick, there's a jellyfish here and I'm worried it might sting me if I make any loud... ''[SpongeBob bumps Patrick and he screams]'' noises.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oops. ''[they run away. The jellyfish shrugs it off]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Is he still after us, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know, buddy!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Should we turn around and check?}}
{{L|Patrick|Okay. ''[they both turn around and trip over something]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, I think I landed on my pain center.}}
{{L|Patrick|I think I landed on a rock. ''[Patrick shows a big rock on the back of his head.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, look! There's a weird thing sticking out of the ground right there.}}
{{L|Patrick|That's just Squidward sunbathing again. ''[Patrick points to Squidward who lowers down his sunglasses.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, not that, Patrick. This!}}
{{L|Patrick|What is it?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know. I think there's something buried underneath it. And I'm gonna go get some shovels so we can dig it up.}}
{{L|Patrick|We?}}
{{L|''[cut to large piles of dirt]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Phew! Nothing like a little manual labor to put some hair on your chest, eh, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'll say. ''[his entire chest is covered with hair while monkey sounds are heard.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Plus look at what we unearthed! A UFO! ''[looks inside]'' Go on, you first. ''[Patrick climbs down a ladder with SpongeBob following]'' Kinda dark, huh?}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah, dark.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, there's gotta be a light switch around here somewhere. Found it. Excuse me, sir. ''[pulls off a skeleton and proceeds to start the submarine]'' Hey, Patrick, look! We're moving! And here's the steering wheel!}}
{{L|Patrick|Now hold it, SpongeBob. You better let me drive.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Gimme that wheel!}}
{{L|Patrick|No! Let go! I wanna drive! ''[the submarine goes crazy. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I don't understand, Squidward. Where are all the customers? I know the Krusty Krab isn't Bikini Bottom's most prestigious eatery, but at least it's better than that salty old Chum Bucket across the street. And that's our only competition.}}
{{L|Squidward|Am I getting paid extra for this conversation?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Oh, come on, Squidward. Can't you just pretend to listen for once in your life? Do it for old Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Squidward|Well, since you can't bring any customers into the Krusty Krab, have you ever thought about bringing the Krusty Krab to the customers?}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Quiet, Squidward, I'm brainstorming! Ooh, ooh! What if instead of bringing customers to the Krusty Krab, we could bring the Krusty Krab to the customers?}}
{{L|Squidward|La la la la la la la la la la la la.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Yes, of course! But how? ''[the submarine crashes into the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Can we park here? ''[Squidward looks up]'' Hey, Mr. Krabs! Look what Patrick and I found! We're gonna use it to go on a long journey.}}
{{L|Patrick|Or even around the block!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|That's it! We'll take the Krusty Krab on the road. ''[cuts to outside]'' So long, boys. Make me lots of money!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Bye, Squidward. Bye, Mr. Krabs. ''[flirtatious]'' Bye, Squidward.}}
{{L|Patrick|You said "Bye, Squidward" twice.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I like Squidward.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[looking through a telescope]'' A traveling restaurant, eh? It's not fair! I had that idea years ago! No matter. If Mr. Krabs wants to play dirty, then Plankton's ready for his turn to take his turn. ''[laughs and turns the fist from the Chum Bucket building into a flying vehicle]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hello!}}
{{L|Con Man|Hello.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Could I interest you in a Krabby Patty?}}
{{L|Con Man|No thanks.}}
{{L|Patrick|Now what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|I don't know, Patrick. Mr. Krabs said if we didn't find customers, not to come back. ''[to Man]'' Are you sure you don't want to be out first customer, sir.}}
{{L|Con Man|Yeah, I'm pretty sure. ''[starts to walk away]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Wait! We'll pay ya!}}
{{L|Con Man|Hey, thanks again, guys. Good luck with the restaurant!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Thank you, sir, come again!}}
{{L|Plankton|Those nincompoops are better salesmen than I suspected. ''[an alarm sets off]''}}
{{L|Karen|Customer approaching.}}
{{L|Plankton|Hello, little boy. Would you like a chum burger?}}
{{L|Boy|Uh, does it come in raspberry?}}
{{L|Plankton|Um, no.}}
{{L|Boy|Blueberry?}}
{{L|Plankton|No.}}
{{L|Boy|Um... raspberry?}}
{{L|Plankton|Ah, come on, kid. You asked me that already. Now quit wasting my time!}}
{{L|Mable|Hey, you can't talk to my son that way! Who do you think you are?}}
{{L|Plankton|I'm Plankton, you old hag. And your son smells like boogers!}}
{{L|Truck Driver|Hey, you can't talk about my wife that way! What do you think this is?!}}
{{L|Plankton|I think it's time for you to lose some weight, fatty. That's what it is.}}
{{L|Mary|Hey, you can't talk to my grandson like that! Someone oughta put you in a mental hospital!}}
{{L|Plankton|Someone should put you in a box floating down the river, Grandma! }}
{{L|Mary|You're probably right.}}
{{L|Plankton|You people are crazy. I'm getting out of here. ''[a person throws a rock at Plankton]'' What the? ''[the crowd starts throwing rocks]'' No! Controls malfunctioning! ''[people continue to throw rocks]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hey, Patrick.}}
{{L|Patrick|Yeah?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Weren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty? ''[cut to the kitchen, where the patties are burnt]'' Oh, no! You burnt all the patties! It's hard as a rock. How are we gonna find somebody who would buy these?}}
{{L|Truck Driver|''[sees there are no more rocks]'' Hey, the rocks are all gone.}}
{{L|Crowd|Awwww. ''[Plankton smiles, but sees SpongeBob coming]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Folks, have I got a deal for you. ''[the crowd sees the hard patties and eagerly buy them]''}}
{{L|Jack|All right, get him! ''[they start to throw the patty rocks at Plankton]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Won't Mr. Krabs be so proud of us when he finds out how good we're doing? See any new customers, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|No, but I see a sign. It says. "Warning: Ab... eyes?"}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Here, let me see. ''[looks through periscope]'' No, Patrick, that says "abyss."}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, okay. What's an abyss, SpongeBob?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|An abyss is a bottomless... ''[SpongeBob turns around, the submarine falls down the abyss]'' ...chasm! ''[an alarm goes off]'' Pat, we're falling!}}
{{L|Patrick|And now we're being bathed in an eerie red light!}}
{{L|Plankton|''[he sees them falling]'' Yes! Yes!}}
{{L|Patrick|[the submarine loses its bolts and breaks in the water] And now, a deafening warning siren. ''[SpongeBob imitates the sound. the submarine hits a sludgy item, which turns out to be the head of the Sea Monster]''}}
{{L|Sea Monster|''[roars]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Look, Patrick! We've floated back up, out of the deep, dark, depressing, horrible abyss! ''[looks at the Sea Monster]''}}
{{L|Sea Monster|Hey! ''[he grabs the submarine and looks into it]'' Who are you calling dark and depressing?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Daa! We didn't mean it that way, Mr. Sea Monster, sir! What we really wanna know is... are you hungry?}}
{{L|Sea Monster|Hungry? I've been asleep for seventy-nine years. Which means my last meal was seventy-nine years ago. Yes, I'm hungry.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Then try one of our Krabby Patties.}}
{{L|Sea Monster|''[eats the Krabby Patty]'' Mmm! That's the best thing I've tasted since that sewer spill, back in... 'seventy-six. I'll take six hundred forty of them.}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|Woo-hoo!}}
{{L|Patrick|Order... uh... up! ''[the Sea Monster gives them large wads of cash]''}}
{{L|Plankton|Now that those two are out of the picture, all of the customers will come running to me. ''<nowiki>[looks at the Sea Monster paying them big money </nowiki>''[literally]''<nowiki>, he rips off the periscope out of fury]</nowiki>'' This calls for drastic-er-est measures! ''[Plankton goes into the abyss]'' Okay, you bums, time for the second course; Chum Charges!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[the Chum Charges explode around the submarine]'' SpongeBob! Our hull's been breached. Do you know what that means?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[after a pause]'' Neither do I!}}
{{L|Plankton|Yes! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the... Huh?! ''[Plankton sees the vehicle crashing into a cavern wall]'' Ah, who needs that old Rust Bucket anyhow.}}
{{L|Sea Monster|Come on in there! I want more sandwiches!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[a piece of chum enters the submarine]'' SpongeBob, look!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What is it?}}
{{L|Patrick|It's a liquid.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|No, it's a solid! It's a solid!}}
{{L|SpongeBob and Patrick|It's a "lol-squid."}}
{{L|Sea Monster|All right, what's going on in there? ''[he sees the Chum Patty]'' Hey, that looks like a sandwich to me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|But not just a sandwich. It's a...Chum-Wich.}}
{{L|Sea Monster|''[eats it and likes it]'' Mmm! Now that's a sandwich!}}
{{L|''[cut to a sequence of SpongeBob making Chum-Wiches, Patrick collecting the Chum, and the Sea Monster paying them for the Chum-Wiches.]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|[the monsters belly is still rumbling] Anything else before we shove off?}}
{{L|Sea Monster|I want dessert! ''[Plankton parachutes down]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We - we don't have desserts.}}
{{L|Plankton|''[lands from his parachute]'' Don't give another penny to those fast-food phonies. That's right, they stole my idea. My, my, my... ''[the end of the periscope breaks off, he falls down and screams as he rolls into some wet mud, hits a rock and lands next to the Sea Mosnter's foot.]''}}
{{L|Sea Monster|''[looks at Plankton]'' Hey, a chocolate éclair. ''[to audience]'' Now that looks like dessert to me.}}
{{L|Plankton|No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You - you've got it all wrong, see... Hey! ''[the Sea Monster chases Plankton through the abyss. cut to the Krusty Krab]''}}
{{L|Janitor|''[repairing the windows SpongeBob and Patrick broke previously]'' There you are, Mr. Krabs, just like new again.}}
{{L|Squidward|Now all we have to do is keep SpongeBob away from the... ''[the submarine crashes into the windows again]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|We're back, Mr. Krabs!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Tell me all about it. Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You wouldn't believe it Mr. Krabs, we had so many new customers!}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|I don't care about that. Tell me about the money.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|There we were at the bottom of a deep, dark, abyss. And we had to let go of something heavy.}}
{{L|Patrick|And paper.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You let go of all the money I earned as ballast?!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[he and Patrick nod their heads, Mr. Krabs is upset]'' But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back thirty-seven thousand pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks!}}
