{{L|''[The episode starts off with Patrick laughing in his house]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Giddy-up! Hyah!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Weren't you going to put your vacation slides in the projector, Patrick?}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. ''[takes out some hash browns]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick, those are hash browns.}}
{{L|Patrick|Hash browns! ''[engulfs the hash browns in his mouth]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Um, Patrick, the slides.}}
{{L|Patrick|Right. The slides. ''[takes out the slides from his belly button]'' Voila! Uh, now what?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Now you put the slides in the projector.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[chuckles & snaps]'' I knew that. Put the slides in the projec-- ''[the stool collapses and the projector breaks into pieces]'' ...tor. Don't worry, SpongeBob. I've got something even better. ''[turns off the lights and turns on the lamp, shining the light at the projector screen]'' Okay, here we go. ''[makes shadow puppets of his rock]'' There I was...}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[claps]'' Ooh, a shadow puppet show!}}
{{L|Patrick|Please, no interruptions.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Sorry.}}
{{L|Patrick|As I was saying... ''[clears throat]'' I was lying around my house, not even planning to have a vacation when I heard a knock at my door. ''[Flashback. SpongeBob walks up to Patrick's rock and knocks on it. Patrick moans]'' For clammin' out loud! Aww, sheesh! I'm still not there yet? ''[grunts. Opens his rock with a key. SpongeBob jumps inside and sees Patrick laying on the floor with the key in his hand]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Patrick! Patrick, what have you done to yourself?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[panting]'' I've been waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping for my whole life without a rest! I need a break from the hustle and bustle of my everyday life. ''[breathlessly]'' It's so exhausting. ''[cries]'' Help me, SpongeBob. Please, help me.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Pal, what you need is a vacation.}}
{{L|Patrick|That's it! I need a vacation! ''[cut to Bikini Travel Agency]''}}
{{L|Travel Agent|So, you'd like a vacation.}}
{{L|Patrick|''[gasps]'' Oh, great. Another thing for me to d--}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[covers Patrick's mouth]'' Yes, he'd like a vacation.}}
{{L|Travel Agent|Well, your options are endless, Mr. Star. Anywhere from beautiful white sandy beaches to exhilarating jungle safaris. It all depends on your budget. ''[SpongeBob and Patrick stare at him. They get booted out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob & Patrick|Ugh!}}
{{L|Patrick|I guess I'll just have to stay home.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|"Stay home"? That's it! You can take a "stay-cation."}}
{{L|Patrick|Wh-what's that?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Take a vacation at home. No packing, no travel, just do whatever you want to do. Best of all, it's free.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, boy! ''[cut to later at Patrick's house]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|All right, Patrick. Enjoy your stay-cation.}}
{{L|Patrick|That's what I'm gonna do, buddy. ''[goes into his rock and walks up to a check in counter]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[dressed up in a hotel suit]'' Welcome to Star Rock Inn, sir. My name is Todd. Can I check you in?}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't know. Can you?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Ah, yes. Star, Star, Star. ''[checking in the computer for Star]'' Patrick Star, room 801. ''[gives him a key]'' Your key, sir. And please don't hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable. ''[rings bell twice and is now dressed as a luggage man]'' May I take your bags, Mr. Star?}}
{{L|Patrick|I don't have any ba-- ''[SpongeBob gives him two suitcases]'' Oh... ''[SpongeBob takes the suitcases back]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Follow me, sir. Your room is right this way. ''[opens a door that leads to a bedroom]'' Your room, sir.}}
{{L|Patrick|Oh, dear.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Something wrong, Mr. Star?}}
{{L|Patrick|Well, um, honestly, I'm not sure I like the way this room is arranged.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Arranged?}}
{{L|French Narrator|One Hour Later.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mr. Star, are you sure about this? ''[standing on top of all the furniture in a pile]''}}
{{L|Patrick|No, I--uh, maybe it's the walls. ''[SpongeBob deflates and all the furniture crashes into a pile of sand]'' I got it. Let's put the room back the way it was originally!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[talking about a bathtub full of water]'' The pool is one of Star Rock Inn's most relaxing features.}}
{{L|Patrick|Ah a pool! ''[rips off shorts, revealing a black speedo, and walks over to the tub]'' Where's the diving board?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|The diving board? Ooh, one diving board, coming up. ''[runs off and puts together a wooden diving board]'' Your diving board, sir.}}
{{L|Patrick|All right! ''[laughs and gets on the diving board and does a few flips in the air and hits the bathtub with his head, and then flips into the water]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|You okay, sir?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[confused]'' My head is swimming just fine, thank you.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, no! ''[runs off and comes back in a lifeguard outfit]'' Lifeguard on duty! ''[blows whistle and pulls Patrick out of the tub]'' You okay, sir?}}
{{L|Patrick|''[teeth chattering]'' So cold.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|This calls for CPR—candy peppermint resuscitation.}}
{{L|Patrick|So weak. ''[SpongeBob sticks the candy peppermint in Patrick' mouth]'' Strength... returning. ''[licks more of the peppermint. His tummy is rumbling]'' But I'm still hungry.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Follow me, sir. ''[now outside, SpongeBob is dressed as a waiter and puts out a table and a giant rock. He drops the giant rock on his foot which causes it to throb and then deflate]'' If you would take your seat, sir. ''[Patrick sits down. SpongeBob puts a bib around his neck.]'' Your dining bib, sir. ''[Patrick reads it as "who's a good boy"]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Wow. What luxury. ''[SpongeBob, now dressed as a chef, wheels a bbq pit over and gets out a spatula and patty]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|One Krabby Patty coming up.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|''[clears throat. SpongeBob gives him a dollar]'' What, no tip?''[SpongeBob hands him some coins]''}}
{{L|Patrick|Hey, what kind of resort is this? Where's the entertainment?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Oh, uh, you are absolutely right, sir. ''[jumps on the table]'' Presenting the SpongeBob Follies! ''[vocalizes music while dancing]'' What the hey.}}
{{L|Patrick|Boring. ''[SpongeBob does a magic trick. Patrick scoffs]'' Lame. ''[SpongeBob swallows a pineapple]''}}
{{L|Man|Three, two, one, liftoff. ''[SpongeBob shoots the pineapple out of his head and into an airplane's turbine, slicing the pineapple's skin off and cutting it into little parts, and back down onto the table]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Well, what do you think?}}
{{L|Patrick|You are smokin'!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Aw, it was nothing.}}
{{L|Patrick|No, no, you're really smoking!}}
{{L|SpongeBob|What? ''[sniffs and sees the patty is burning]'' Oh, no, the Krabby Patty! ''[the black smoke fills up around him and Patrick. Patrick exits through the back and his tummy is rumbling again]''}}
{{L|Patrick|My tummy is still lonely. ''[sniffs the aroma in the air]'' Ahh. ''[sees the aroma is coming from behind Squidward's kitchen where he is making some sort of stew]''}}
{{L|Squidward|''[sniffs the stew and sighs]'' ''[licks on it and smacks his lips over and over]'' Ah, delish. ''[brings a bowl of stew to the table]'' Oh, silly me. I forgot the napkin. ''[walks off to get it from the cabinet]'' And now an elegant meal for an elegant person. ''[walks back to the table to see Patrick eating his stew]''}}
{{L|Patrick|I am quite refined. ''[slurps the rest of the bowl]'' Ah! ''[burps]''}}
{{L|Squidward|What are you doing here?}}
{{L|Patrick|I'm on vacation! The last resort I was staying at was a dump, but this place is awesome. Oh, hey, waiter... ''[snaps]'' a napkin, please. ''[Squidward growls]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|''[coming out of the black smoke with a burnt patty on a plate]'' Mr. Star, your meal is ready. ''[Krabby Patty dissolves into dust and blown away by the wind]'' Patrick, where is he? ''[Squidward screams]'' Ah!}}
{{L|Squidward|Patrick, you dimwitted moron, get out of my kitchen!}}
{{L|Patrick|Good idea. I think I'll head over to the spa. ''[bones crack]'' I could use a massage.}}
{{L|Squidward|Get this into your tiny, tiny, little, tiny brain—this is not a resort. It's my house. There is no spa. And you can't get a massage!}}
{{L|Patrick|''[moaning]'' Oh, yeah, that's the spot. ''[SpongeBob is giving him a massage]'' Hey, you should get a massage, too.}}
{{L|Squidward|''[scoffs]'' Not likely. ''[bones crack]'' Ow ow ow ow! What the hey?! ''[pushes Patrick off the table]'' Move over. I want a deep tissue treatment and don't forget the feet.}}
{{L|French Narrator|5 Hours Later.}}
{{L|''[Squidward is sleeping and SpongeBob is tired out]''}}
{{L|SpongeBob|So tired. ''[goes into his house and gets into bed. Sighs but notices snoring is coming from Patrick]'' Patrick, what are you doing here?}}
{{L|Patrick|That resort next door is too crowded. Then I found this place. It's quiet and peaceful. Good night, SpongeBob. ''[snores. Cut to Mr. Krabs gargling in front of his sink. Goes into his room, turns on the light, and sees SpongeBob in his hammock, snoring]''}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Wake up, laddy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Hmm? Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|You have another nasty old dream?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mm-mmm.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Patrick in your bed again?}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Mm-hmm.}}
{{L|Mr. Krabs|Aye. Well, good night, laddy.}}
{{L|SpongeBob|Good night, sir.}}
