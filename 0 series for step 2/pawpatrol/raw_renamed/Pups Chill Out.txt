|(Panting)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|It's so hot out today!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Then jump in here with us, Rocky!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|In a pool full of water? No, thanks.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|I know the best way to cool off. Liver-flavored... frozen... Puppy Pops!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|Mmm, yeah! Puppy pops!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|Let's go get some!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Cheering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Yuck! Water would be so cool if it wasn't so wet. Bleh!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Bad news, pups. Somebody ate the last of the Puppy Pops!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Mmm!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|Marshall!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|What? Oh, was that the last box? Oops.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|It's all right, Marshall. I can pick up another box at Mr. Porter's.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|Can you get two boxes?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Or a whole case?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|A whole case, huh? Okay! But I'll need some help carrying it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|I'll do it! Since I ate the last one.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Cheering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Porter]]:
|Sorry, folks, but I've run out of icy drinks, and frozen yogurt.
|-

|(Sighing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Porter]]:
|(Sighing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Hi, Mr. Porter! May we have some liver-flavored Puppy Pops, please?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Porter]]:
|Sorry, I've run out of those, too.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Oh, no!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Ah-hah. Fan, please.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cat Rocky]]:
|(Meowing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Quick, get me some Meow Meow ic pops to cool off my kittens.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Oh, Mr. Porter, some frozen corn for Chickaletta, please. This heat wave has hit Adventure Bay so hard.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Porter]]:
|I'm so sorry, mayors! But all the ice pops and frozen corn are gone.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Oh, but what will my poor overheated chicken do?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Porter]]:
|It will be okay. I'm expecting a rush delivery of frozen food any minute now.

|-

|Uh-oh, I'm stuck!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Gouge beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Roger]]:
|And my freezer is broken, too! Aw... I need help.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Pup-pad ringing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Ryder here.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Roger]]:
|It's Roger. My truck skidded into a ditch. Now my engine won't start, and the freezer's not working! That food won't stay cold for long.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Mayors:
|Save that truck!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Don't worry, we'll save the delivery for everyone.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Roger]]:
|Please hurry.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Roger, Roger! No job is too big, no pup is too small! PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|Ryder needs us!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa...
|-

|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|PAW Patrol, ready for action, Ryder, sir!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Thanks for hustling in this heat, pups. Roger's delivery truck hit a pizza and slid into a ditch!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|A smooshed pizza? What a waste!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Now the truck's freezer isn't working, and everyone is waiting for cool food to beat the heat!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|We've gotta save those Puppy Pops!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Chase, we'll need your winch to put the truck out of the ditch.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Chase is on the case!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Rocky, we'll need your tools to fix the truck, and get the freezer running again.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Green means go!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Alright! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:

|Good to see you, PAW Patrol!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Wow, that is one stuck truck! (Barking) Winch! (Barking) Retract!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Rocky, how fast can you get that truck running?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Let me check. Hmm... it will take me awhile, but I can fix the engine here. The parts I need for the freezer, though, are back in town.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Roger]]:
|But my shipment will metl in this heat!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Unless we can get you a lot of ice. (Gasps) I know!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Pup-pad beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Rubble? Skye?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Rubble and Skye:
|Yes, Ryder?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Rubble, I need you to go to Jake's Mountain and use your jackhammer to cut out a huge block of ice.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Rubble on the double!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|But first, Skye, I need you to fly up and find a nunk of ice for Rubble to cut. Then carry the ice back to Roger's truck with your copter.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|That's going to be one chilly copter. But let's take to the sky!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|I'll meet you guys at the mountain!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Ryder, there's a ginormous hunk of ice up ahead! Follow me.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Rubble, cut a block of ice as big as the back of Roger's truck.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|You bet! (Barking) Jackhammer!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Jackhammer pounding)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Crashing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Great job, Rubble! Looks good. It's ready to go, Skye. We'll meet you at the truck!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Here comes the world's biggest ice cube!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|What's taking those Meow Meow Ice Pops so long? Ooh, I could make a lot of snow comes with all that ice.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Kittens:
|(Meowing angrily)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Fine, snow cones and Meow Pops. Good, now's my chance. You two, follow that copter!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cat Skye]]:
|(Meowing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Menacing laughter)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|There it is! Kitties, get me that ice!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Oh, come to me, you cool, beautiful—- way too big ice cube! (Screaming) Whoa! No! Stop! My precious ice! (Groaning) Ahh, it's so cool and refreshing. What?! And fast! Augh! Hah, I made it—- Oh, no! Help!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Ryder! Mayor Humdinger's kitties cut the ice block! Now it's sliding down the road! With the mayor on it!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Help!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, Skye, I'll call Chase and Rubble to help.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Rubble, Chase, I want you to move old logs to the sides of the roads, to keep Mayor Humdinger from running off it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Yes, sir, Ryder!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Screaming)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Here they come!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Grunting and whimpering) Whoa... ohh! Agh, not in there! Oh! Wha... oh!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Rocky and Roger:
|Huh?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Oh, whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Over to you, Rubble!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Shouting) Whoa, whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Goal! And now it's my turn! (Barking) Harness!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Screaming) (Groans)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Great save, Skye! Nice shot, Rubble!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Thanks to an awesome assist from Marshall!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|How did you know we could use an extra set of paws?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Well, I felt bad about the Puppy Pops, so I came to see if you needed any help.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Engine's fixed and ready to go!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Roger]]:
|Great! See you in Adventure Bay!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|(Gasps) Poor pizza, never had a chance.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Kittens:
|(Slurping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Roger]]:
|Thanks for your help with my truck, PAW Patrol!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Porter]]:
|And for saving the frozen food!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|It's all "cool"! Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|I'm sorry for, uh, borrowing your ice, but if you don't need it anymore, can I have it?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Sure you can, Mayor Humdinger! It's right over there.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Groaning) Well, how am I to get relief from this heat? Hmmph. Hey, give me one of those.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, Mayor Humdinger, but they're--
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Blech, yuck! What is this?!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|A liver-flavored Puppy Pop!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Oh, ugh!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Mmm... (Slurping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Slow down, Marshall, you'll get--
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|(Shivering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|Brain freeze!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|It was worth it... So cool.
