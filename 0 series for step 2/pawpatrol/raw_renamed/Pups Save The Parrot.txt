|So, did your parrot come home yet?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:01:57 [[Carlos]]:
|No, I haven't seen Mateo at all. I'm worried.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:01 [[Carlos]]:
|He's little and isn't used to being on his own in the jungle.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:04 [[Ryder]]:
|Hmm, we saw a big harpy eagle up the road.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:07 [[Carlos]]:
|Uh-oh. Mateo's no match for a big bird like that.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:11 [[Ryder]]:
|Don't worry, the PAW Patrol will find Mateo.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:14 [[Ryder]]:
|No job is too big, no parrot's too small.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:19 [[Ryder]]:
|PAW Patrol to the PAW Patroller.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:22 Pups:
|Ryder needs us!

|Sorry to cut your jungle fun short, pups, but we have an emergency.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:03 [[Ryder]]:
|Carlos' little parrot Mateo is still missing in the jungle.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:07 [[Marshall]]:
|Aww!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:08 [[Chase]]:
|On his own?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:09 [[Rubble]]:
|Poor little parrot.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:11 [[Ryder]]:
|Mateo doesn't know how to take care of himself in the jungle.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:14 [[Ryder]]:
|Look for his blue and red colors.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:17 [[Ryder]]:
|Oh, and Carlos has trained him to talk.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:20 [[Carlos]]:
|Yeah, I taught him to say "Squawk!" for help. Squawk!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:24 Everyone:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:27 [[Ryder]]:
|Skye, I need you and your helicopter to look for Mateo from the air.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:30 [[Skye]]:
|This puppy's got to fly!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:34 [[Ryder]]:
|Chase, I need you to use your spy drone to search the treetops.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:38 [[Chase]]:
|Chase is on the case!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:40 [[Ryder]]:
|Great.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:42 [[Ryder]]:
|Marshall, I need you to use your ladder to look for Mateo in the thick leaves.
|-

|I'm fired up!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:48 [[Ryder]]:
|PAW Patrol is on a roll!

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:04 [[Marshall]]:
|Hey, there's something red!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:07 [[Marshall]]:
|The tallest tree in the jungle is a great spot for a parrot to hide.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:11 [[Marshall]]:
|(Barking) Ladder!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:17 [[Marshall]]:
|I thought I saw something red. Oh, it's just a red flower.

|Something red, something red.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:43 Little Toad:
|(Croaking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:44 [[Chase]]:
|Huh? That's not a parrot, it's a cute little toad.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:53 [[Chase]]:
|There's something red.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:56 [[Chase]]:
|Marshall, are you missing your hat?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:59 [[Marshall]]:
|Mandy has it! Every time I try to grab it back, she puts a banana in my mouth!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:04 [[Mandy]]:
|(Chattering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:06 [[Marshall]]:
|See?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:07 [[Chase]]:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:16 [[Skye]]:
|Ryder, I see a red bird!
|-

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:19 [[Skye]]:
|Whoa! Eagle!
|-

|Whoa! Evasive manoeuvres!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:32 Harpy Eagle:

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:38 [[Ryder]]:
|Skye, are you okay?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:40 [[Skye]]:
|Yeah, but that was close!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:44 [[Skye]]:
|Wait a sec.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:46 [[Skye]]:
|Mateo is a red and blue parrot, right? I think I found him!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:51 [[Skye]]:
|He's headed towards the ruins.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:53 [[Ryder]]:
|On our way, Skye.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:55 (Sound):
|(Sirens blaring)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:01 [[Marshall]]:
|These old ruins are creepy. I feel like something is watching us.
|-

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:18 [[Carlos]]:
|Mateo!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:19 [[Marshall]]:
|It came from the roof!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:20 [[Marshall]]:
|If only we had a pup who could get up there.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:26 [[Marshall]]:
|Oh, like me, huh? (Gulping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:33 [[Marshall]]:
|I don't see Mateo up here. I'm coming down.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:35 [[Ryder]]:
|He's got to be up there somewhere.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:38 [[Marshall]]:
|Okay, I'll keep looking.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:44 [[Marshall]]:
|Mateo!
|-

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:58 [[Marshall]]:

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:00 [[Ryder]]:
|Marshall, any luck?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:02 [[Marshall]]:
|I found him, Ryder. He just went around this corner.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:07 [[Marshall]]:
|A-ha!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:08 Mateo:
|(Squawking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:10 [[Marshall]]:

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:11 [[Marshall]]:
|An egg?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:13 [[Marshall]]:
|Aww. I know why Mateo doesn't want to leave. Look!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:18 Mateo:
|Yelp for help!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:19 [[Ryder]]:
|What? He's a she?

|So, Mateo is a she?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:58 [[Carlos]]:
|And a mom. (Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:09:00 [[Carlos]]:
|I guess now I should call her "Matea".
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:09:03 [[Carlos]]:
|She can't leave until her egg hatches.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:09:05 [[Carlos]]:
|I'll stay up on the roof with her and make sure she's safe.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:09:07 [[Ryder]]:
|We'll all stay. That eagle is still out there.

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:09:10 [[Rubble]]:
|(Screaming)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:09:23 [[Rubble]]:
|It was just a marshmallow.

|Little chick, no!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:10 [[Ryder]]:
|We'll deal with the eagle, you get down to the ground in case the chick falls.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:14 [[Carlos]]:
|Got it!
|-

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:03 [[Ryder]]:
|Nice flying, Chase.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:05 [[Ryder]]:
|That'll keep the eagle too far away to do any damage.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:08 Baby Matea:
