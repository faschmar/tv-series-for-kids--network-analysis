|Pleased to meet you. I'm Jeremy the Genie.

|I'm Rubble the, uh, pup and this is Rocky the, uh, other pup.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:06 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|I've never granted a wish to a pup before.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:09 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|But that's the deal; let me out, you get three wishes.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:12 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|So, Rubble, what would you like?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:14 [[Rubble]]:
|I get three wishes?!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:16 [[Rubble]]:
|Cool!

|Yup. I just graduated from genie school. I'm an expert... almost.
|-

|Hmm... what do I really, really, really want?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:29 [[Rubble]]:
|I know! A bone that'll last forever!
|-

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:36 [[Rubble]]:
|Awesome.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:40 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|Grant this wish to a pup so clever, one big bone that'll last forever!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:48 [[Rubble]]:
|Whoa! My wish bone!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:53 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|Did I mention I'm still kinda learning?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:02:57 [[Farmer Al]]:
|Oh! My barn!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:01 [[Rubble]]:
|Don't worry, Farmer Al. We'll get Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:04 [[Farmer Al]]:
|Well, now I've seen everything!
|-

|(Wrench clicking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:09 [[Rubble]]:
|Ryder! (Panting)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:10 [[Rubble]]:
|I found this old Jack-in-the-box...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:12 [[Rubble]]:
|(Panting) ...and there was a genie inside, and he granted me three wishes, so I wished for this big, big bone and when I got it...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:18 [[Rocky]]:
|It broke Farmer Al's barn roof!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:20 [[Ryder]]:
|Okay... that's a new one. But we'll take care of it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:24 [[Ryder]]:
|No wish is too big, no pup is too small!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:03:28 (Sound):

|Thanks for hurrying over, pups.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:20 [[Ryder]]:
|Rubble was helping at Farmer Al's when he found an old Jack-in-the-box with a genie inside.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:26 Pups:
|Wow!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:27 [[Skye]]:
|A genie?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:28 [[Skye]]:
|Can he make wishes come true?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:30 [[Ryder]]:
|I guess he can.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:32 [[Ryder]]:
|Rubble wished for a bone that would last forever.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:35 [[Rubble]]:
|(Crushing) Ah!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:36 [[Skye]]:
|That's one bone-crushing problem.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:38 [[Ryder]]:
|(Chuckling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:40 [[Ryder]]:
|Rubble...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:41 (Sound):
|(Beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:42 [[Ryder]]:
|I need you and your crane to lift the bone off the roof.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:44 [[Rubble]]:
|Rubble on the double!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:46 [[Ryder]]:
|Rocky...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:47 (Sound):
|(Beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:48 [[Ryder]]:
|I need you and your tool arm to repair Farmer Al's roof.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:51 [[Rocky]]:
|Green means go!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:53 [[Ryder]]:
|Skye...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:54 (Sound):
|(Beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:04:55 [[Ryder]]:
|I need your 'copter to give Rocky a lift, so he can repair the roof, then you can bring the bone back home.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:00 [[Skye]]:
|(Barking) Let's take to the sky!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:05:03 [[Ryder]]:
|All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!

|Rubble, use your crane to lift that bone off the roof.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:19 [[Rubble]]:
|I'm on it!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:25 [[Ryder]]:
|Hi. You must be Jeremy.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:27 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|Who is this all-knowing and very powerful genie?

|I can't get a grip on this!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:48 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|I know what you need.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:49 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|This bone's so big, it's a scan scandal, we need to lift it with a...
|-

|A candle?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:06:55 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|No. Oh, okay. How about this?
|-

|A sandal?!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:04 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|(Groaning) Okay, one more.
|-

|We need to lift it with a...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:09 [[Rubble]]:
|A handle! Yes, that's perfect.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:07:13 [[Rubble]]:
|Thanks, Jeremy the Genie.
|-

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:16 [[Rubble]]:
|Thanks for reminding me. Hmm...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:19 [[Rubble]]:
|A belly scratching machine?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:21 [[Rubble]]:
|Nah. Maybe a stick that throws itself, so I can play fetch...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:25 [[Rubble]]:
|(Splashing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:08:28 [[Rubble]]:

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:03 [[Ryder]]:
|Skye, I need you and your 'copter to lower me on your cable, so I can lift Rubble out of the tub.

|Uh, yeah.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:20 [[Ryder]]:
|A little lower, Skye.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:22 [[Ryder]]:
|Hang tight, Rubble.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:23 [[Rubble]]:
|I'm trying.
|-

|Thanks, Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:37 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:

|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:47 [[Rubble]]:
|Gosh, everyone, thanks so much.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:50 [[Ryder]]:
|It's okay. Whenever you're in trouble, just wish for help.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:54 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|Speaking of wishes... what's your last one going to be, Rubble?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:10:58 [[Rubble]]:
|My friends are so great, I really wish I could do something nice for all of them.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:04 [[Jeremy the Genie|Jeremy]]:
|Done.
|-

| class="transcript_time"|00:11:14 [[Rubble]]:
|Mmm...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:16 [[Ryder]]:
|Rubble, wake up. Time to go home.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:19 [[Ryder]]:
|Farmer Al said you were a big help.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:21 [[Farmer Al]]:
|I'll say. You good pups deserve some good treats.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:25 [[Rubble]]:
|No thanks. I ate a bunch from the sky.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:28 [[Ryder]]:
|Are you all right?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:30 [[Rubble]]:
|Barns give me weird dreams.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:32 [[Farmer Al]]:
|(Chuckling) They make you messy too.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:34 [[Rubble]]:
|No way am I taking a bath.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:11:36 [[Rubble]]:
|Nope.
