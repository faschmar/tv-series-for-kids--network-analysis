|(Car horn honking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|There's only one thing better than going to the jungle.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|What's that?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Going to the jungle to celebrate Carlos' birthday.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:

|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Barking and howling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Hey, Carlos. Happy Birthday.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Carlos]]:
|Gracias, mis amigos.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Want to see the giant cake we brought?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Carlos]]:
|Did you say "giant"? That's my favorite flavor.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|I almost forgot how beautiful this place is.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|But it feels like something's missing.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|It does?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Yep, party decorations!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Robo-Dog]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Gasping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Oh, fantástico. I'll go hang the streamers. (Barking) Cables!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Mechanism whirring)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Cool move, Tracker.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|You're a real-deal acrobat.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|What are you looking at, dude?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Oh, nada. I was just hoping to see Mr. Postman. He's supposed to deliver my muy especial gift for Carlos.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Ooh. What is it?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|I'm not saying. I want it to be a surprise for everyone.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Carlos]]:
|That's so nice, Tracker, but I don't need a gift. I'm just happy that everyone is here to help me celebrate.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Don't worry, Tracker. Mr. Postman always brings the mail on time.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Yeah, it'll get here.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Don't worry.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mailman]]:
|Oh, boy. Better be careful. I don't want this delivery to be delayed.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Can you take this one, too?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Sure can. (Barking) Wings!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Mechanism whirring)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Those bright colors really pop.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|I just hope the balloons don't.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Both:
|(Giggling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Monkey:
|Oh. (Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Monkeys:
|(Gibbering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Wow. Look at all those streamers.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Gracias.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|And how do you like all the balloons?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Huh?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Uh, they're very invisible?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]] and [[Rocky]]:
|Huh?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|But they were just there.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|The wind must have blown them away. But don't worry, I brought extra balloons. We'll just blow up some more.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Tires squealing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Did you hear that? It sounded like screeching tires.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Maybe it's Mr. Postman.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mandy]]:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Tires squealing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Monkeys:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Everyone:
|Huh?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|And that solves the mystery of the missing balloons.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|But not the mystery of the missing Mr. Postman. Where coud he be?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Tires grinding on gravel)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mailman]]:
|Whoa! Whoa, whoa! My mail is flying away. Whoa. This is quite a dilemma. I better call Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Pup-pad ringing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|(Giggling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mailman]]:
|Hello, Ryder. My truck is stuck in the mud and my mail is up a tree.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Looks like you're sinking, too. We're on our way. No mail truck is too big, no pup is too small! PAW Patrol, to the PAW Patroller!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|Ryder needs us!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Careful.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Look out!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Whoa-oa! (Crashing) I'm okay. I'm just vine.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Everyone:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|PAW Patrol, ready for action, Ryder, sir!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Thanks for hustling over, pups. Poor Mr. Postman had a very bumpy ride today, and now his truck is stuck and the mail is up in a tree.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|(Gasping) The mail? Oy-oy-oy! Carlos' present is in there.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|And other people's important mail, too. So, for this mission, I'll need Chase. I'll need you to use your winch to pull Mr. Postman's truck out of the mud.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Chase is on the case!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|And Tracker, I need you to use your grappling cables to bring the mail down from the tree.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|I'm all ears, and cables, too.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|PAW Patrol is on a roll!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Robo-Dog]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Barking and howling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Music):
|♪ (Deployment sequence for Chase and Tracker)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Engines reviving and siren wailing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|There's Mr. Postman, and his truck is really stuck in that mud.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Except that's no ordinary mud, It's quicksand. His truck is sinking. Que malo.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mailman]]:
|It's a crying shame about my truck, but the real disaster will be flks not getting their mail.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Don't worry, we'll take care of everything. Let's get that truck out.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|On it, Ryder. (Barking) Winch!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Mechanism whirring)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, Chase. Pull. Yes!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mailman]]:
|Delightful. Thanks.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Now, Tracker, go bring down that mailbag.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|I thought you'd never ask. (Barking) Cables! Got it. (Grunting) I don't see my package, it was covered in special paper.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Hey, what's that up there?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|That's it, yes! (Barking) Cables!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Monkey:
|(Chanting)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|No!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mailman]]:
|Golly. I've heard of airmail, but never monkey mail.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Sorry, Tacker. We'll go look for it, but it won't be easy to find in the jungle.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|I know how to find it, I can listen for it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Listen for it? Package don't make sounds.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|This one does...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Latin music playing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|...and it's calling me right now. Follow me.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Monkeys:
|(Gibbering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Snake:
|(Hissing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Monkeys, did you see a package?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Monkeys:
|(Gibbering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Latin music playing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Snake:
|(Hissing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Frog:
|(Croaking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Serpiente, did you see a package?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Siren wailing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Hey, guys!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Frog:
|(Croaking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Did you find the package?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|No, but I can still hear the sound. But now it's like an echo. It keeps repeating.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|This map says there's a gorge just beyond this ridge. It the package fell in there, it would sound like that.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Engines reviving)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Ahí está! There it is!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Monkey:
|(Gibbering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Ay no!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|It's okay, Tracker, we'll just go down into the gorge and get it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|But you can't get down there, the cliff hills are too steep.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Then you'll have to use your cable and lower yourself in.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Buena idea. (Barking) Cables!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Mechanism whirring)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|My cable is too short.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, Tracker, just hang on. Time to call for air support.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|So, you need me to help Tracker get lower? Okay, I'm down with it. Take it to the sky!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Elevator, going down.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Easy, Skye. Just a little lower.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Got it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|He's got it! He did it!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Woo-hoo-hoo!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Great work, pups. I think you've all earned a party.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Monkeys:
|(Gibbering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Carlos]]:
|Thank you, everyone. This is awesome.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|And thanks especially for helping me save Carlos' gift.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|It's what we do. Whenever there's a problem, just yelp for help!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Or yelp for cake. (Barking) It looks so yummy.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Not yet. Carlos has to open su regalo.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Ooh. I want to see, too.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Carlos]]:
|Wow. I love the picture, and what a cool frame.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|But wait, there's more.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Latin music playing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|''♪ Happy, Happy Birthday, I can't believe my luck ♪''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|''♪ To find a boy like you, and get to be your pup ♪''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|''♪ Feliz Cumpleaños, Carlos' is today ♪''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|''♪ Always my best buddy, amigos all the way ♪''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Carlos]]:
|Friends forever.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|Aw!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|What a great song. Now, who wants cake?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|You don't have to ask me twice.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Monkey:
|(Gibbering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Tracker]]:
|Or the monkeys.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Everyone:
|(Laughing)
