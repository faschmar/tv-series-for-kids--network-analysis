|Nice outfit, but it's a bit early for Halloween, isn't it?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|This is a traditional hula skirt, Mayor Humdinger—- the proper attire for our luau to celebrate the opening of Adventure Beach!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|A luau?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Katie]]:
|A Hawaiian party!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Beach party? Hah! What a silly idea.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Well, find then, I won't invite you. You'll miss all the music and dancing.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Porter]]:
|And the food!
|-

|Food?!

|Please?! Why, I--
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Fine, I accept. When's dinner?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Pups, Mayor Goodway has asked us to be Adventure Beach's lifeguard rescue team. From our new Beach Tower HQ, we'll be the Sea Patrol. But before you can save anyone, you have to earn your lifeguard badge.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(All howling happily)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|We're ready, Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, pups, lifeguard are in charge of keeping everyone safe on the beach and in the water. And if someone does get in trouble, it's up to us to rescue them quickly.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|Ready, set, get wet!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Exactly. So, I'll need you to save that guy—- Mr. Prickly.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Guy? That's a pineapple.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|That's why he's called Mr. Prickly. Save him before my pup-pad buzzes and you'll earn your lifeguard badge.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(All cheering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Lifeguard badge, awesome!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, Chase, you're first. Race through the markers to Mr. Prickly, then put him in your rescue buoy and bring him back here.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|I'll bring that pineapple head back before he can say "help."
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Whistle blowing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|(Barking, howling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Cheering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Chase is one the case! (Barking) Rescue buoy! Hang on tight.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|You did it!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Yay, you did it!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Awesome!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|You finished with lots of time to spare. You've earned your Sea Patrol lifeguard badge.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Wow, way to go, Chase.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Way to go!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, next pup.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Everyone:

|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Marshall!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Oh, yeah!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Great! You made it just in time. Rocky, you're the only one left.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|That's okay. I don't like getting wet.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|You can't be a lifeguard without getting wet, Rocky.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Hmm. We'll see about that. Ready?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Whistle blowing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Oh! (Barking) Rescue buoy! See? Nice and dry.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Cool rescue technique, but if you want to earn your lifeguard badge, you have to swim.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|How 'bout if I be a land guard instead?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|I know you can do this, Rocky. But if you don't feel up to it now, you can try later. Mr. Prickly will be waiting for you. Come on, pups. It's time to get out of uniform and go party at the luau.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:

|Uh-oh, that's the sonar siren.

|Uh-oh. That ping looks like trouble. Wally, let's pack up and turn for town. Whoa! Oh! No! Slithering sea serpents! Great gushing geysers! I need the PAW Patrol!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Aloha, friends! Welcome to our Adventure Beach luau.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Okay, okay. When do we eat?!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|After the PAW Patrol gets here.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Look! Here they come!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Crowd:
|(Cheering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Sorry we're late, we were doing lifeguard drills.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Okay, now can we eat?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Okay then.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:

|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Ryder!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Hey, Cap'n Turbot. You're misssing the luau.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|I've got more pressing problems. Look! Terrible tentacles are taking my tug!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Don't worry, Cap'n. No sea monster's too big, no pup is too small!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Sea Patrol, to the Beach Tower!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|Ryder needs us! (Barking and howling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Ha-ha! Close one. Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Hey, where's Marshall?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Look, I'm a floaty toy.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(All laughing, barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Sea Patrol, ready for action, Captain Ryder, sir!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Cap'n Turbot's got big trouble, pups.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|No!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(All gasping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|What is that thing?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|I'm not sure, but I do know it'll stink the Flounder if we don't do something fast. So, for this mission, I'll need Zuma. I need you to use your new boat with its grabber arms to pull the tentacles off the Flounder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|Ready, set, get wet!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|And I'll also need Rubble. I need you to use your new construction boat's crane to grab Cap'n Turbot off the boat.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Rubble on the double!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|I'll also need lifeguards to make sure everyone is safely out of the water until we take of… whatever that thing is.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|I'd like to help, but I guess I can't.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Sorry, Rocky, not till you've earned your lifeguard badge. Chase? Skye?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Sure thing. Let's go, Skye.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Alright! Sea Patrol is on a roll!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Uh, Ryder, how are we gonna get out to the Flounder?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Watch this!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|All aboard, pups!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Powering up)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|What's that noise?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Load 'er up, Robo-Dog.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Robo-Dog]]:

| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):

|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Welcome to the Sea Patroller.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Robo-Dog]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Robo-Dog, take us to sea!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|The Beach Tower turns into a boat?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]] and [[Skye]]:
|(Howling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Giant baby octopus]]:
|Yum, yum, yum! (Chattering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Please be careful with my precious Flounder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Air horn blaring)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Oh, thank goodness. It's the PAW Patrol with a super slick ship!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Cap'n Turbot, we're here to save you! Zuma, Rubble, Sea Patrol, go!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Roger, Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|You got it, Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Music):
|♪ (Deployment sequence for Zuma and Rubble)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Robo-Dog, steer the Sea Patroller closer to the Flounder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Robo-Dog]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|They're coming from everywhere!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Look out!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Oh, no!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Oh, no! Now the tentacles have the Sea Patroller too!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|I've got Ryder. You rescue Cap'n Turbot.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|You got it!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|I'm coming, dudes! It's tickle time!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|(Gasping) Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]] and [[Marshall]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Oh, no. It's gonna drop me in the water.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|(Gasping) I'm coming!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Thanks, Marshall.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Ryder, this is tough. These tentacles keep getting in the way! I can't get to Cap'n Turbot.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Maybe we can scare them off. Robo-Dog, give them a blast of the horn.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Robo-Dog]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Air horn blaring musically)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|It worked!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Everyone:
|(All cheering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Uh-oh! My boat is still sinking!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Hurry, Rubble. Use your crane to get him.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|You got it, Ryder. (Barking) Crane!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Whoa! Ah!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|It'll be okay, Cap'n. The pups and I will do everything we can to raise the Flounder back up.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Please, I can't bear to be without my boat.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Zuma, Rubble, take Cap'n Turbot back to Adventure Beach. Maybe the party will cheer him up.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Aye-aye, Captain Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|I'll try. Though, I doubt my smile will come up until my boat does.

|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, pups, we have to raise Cap'n Turbot's ship from the ocean floor. It's scuba time.
|-

|Yes!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Scuba? Like in the water?

|You don't have to if you don't want to, Rocky.
|-

|Thanks, Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Marshall, you have the perfect tool for this job. Dive down and use your air tanks to pump air into the Flounder's hull. That should make it float back up.
|-

|I'm ready for a blub-blub rescue! (Chuckling)
|-

|(Barking) Scuba!

|Wow! Cool new suit, Marshall.

|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|How will we ever stop this ferocious, rampaging water beast?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|You know, I don't think that octopus is ferocious, Mayor. It's not really trying to hurt anyone. Look how it's squinting. It's looking for something, but it just can't see very well.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|What's it looking for?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Well, keep it away from me! I don't want that on my head, too. Oh, this nuisance won't let go. Now, cut that out!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|(Gasping) That's it! This must be the big octopus' baby, and all the things it's checking out are pink and shaped like him. We need to get that baby back to its mom.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Well, good luck getting him off.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Katie]]:
|Maybe we can lure the baby off with a treat.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Good ida! Wow, everything's almost gone.
|-

|Don't look at me.

|Oh, great. Now, it's full. I'll never shake this creature!

|Ah! What's it doing?!

|Ah!

|Careful, Mayor Humdinger!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Giant octopus]]:
|(Grunting)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|We need that rattle.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|I can find it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Huh?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|With my metal detector.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Are you sure, Rocky? You'll have to swim and get wet.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|If getting wet will help that baby octopus get back to his mom, I can do it!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|That's my Sea Patrol pup. I saw the rattle land around here.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Okay, I can do this! (Barking) Metal detector!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Beeping faster)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Rattling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|You found it! You're amazing!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Hey, it's just water.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, pups, we still have a job to finish. I'll need a magnifying glass to make the baby look so big even its mama can see it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|But where are you going to find a magnifying glass?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Hmm... I'll start with this punch bowl.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Giant octopus]]:
|(Gumbling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Hey, Mom, over here!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Giant octopus]]:
|(Gasping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|I hope Mom isn't as hungry as this little guy.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|She's not hungry, she just misses her baby.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, Zuma, it's time to rattle and roll.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Rattling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|That's it. Come on.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Rattling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Giant baby octopus]]:
|(Chattering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Okay, Zuma, we're out far enough.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Rattling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Zuma]]:
|Now, that's a hug!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Oh, thank you, PAW Patrol! You saved the beach and the party!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|I think Rocky deserves the biggets thank you. He got wet to save the day and earned this.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|My lifeguard badge? Awesome!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(All cheering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Can we eat now?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Oh, now you're talking! But eat what?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|(Sound):
|(Air horn sounding)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Hey, friends! I brought some food as a thanks for fixing my favorite Flounder!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Barking and howling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|But, Ryder, what if that mama loses her baby again and returns?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Whenever there's a problem, Mayor, just yelp for help! And the Sea Patrol will be there.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Oh, Ryder, we can always count on you.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|But I don't think she'll be back. I did a little octopus eye doctor work.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Giant octopus]]:
|(Grumbling happily)

| class="transcript_time"|[[Giant baby octopus]]:
