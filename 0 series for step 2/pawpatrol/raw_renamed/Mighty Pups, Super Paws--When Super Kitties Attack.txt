|''(The episode starts with Ryder and the pups lifting the meteor into the Lookout.)''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:48 [[Ryder]]:
|Thanks for helping with the meteor, pups.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:50 [[Rubble]]:
|No problem, Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:53 [[Marshall]]:
|Is it glowing again?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|00:55 [[Ryder]]:
|Yep. That's why we're putting it in the tower, so you pups can get your mighty powers whenever you need them.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:00 [[Zuma]]:
|Sweet! How about right now? I could just hold up my paws and my water power would totally push the meteor right in place. Whoosh!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:09 [[Skye]]:
|I could use my mighty whirlwind to lift it way up. Whoosh!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:15 [[Chase]]:
|Not if I run it up there first with my super speed. Vroom!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:19 [[Ryder]]:
|(Laughing) Your powers were pretty awesome.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:22 [[Rocky]]:
|Ah, look at me. I'm super strong.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:25 [[Rubble]]:
|Hey. That's my mighty power.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:28 (Sound):
|(Beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:31 (Scene):
|''(The meteor gets placed in its spot.)''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:34 [[Rubble]]:
|The meteor is in place, Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:37 [[Ryder]]:
|Thanks, Rubble. We're all set.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:39 [[Marshall]]:
|I miss being a Mighty Pup. I hope we get to use our powers again soon.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:43 (Scene):
|''(The scene changes to Mayor Humdinger and Harold Humdinger at the beach.)''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:45 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Slurping) Find anything yet, nephew?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:47 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Not yet, Uncle Mayor, but I know that meteor crashed right around here. 
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:51 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|If a piece of it broke off, my Space Rock Finder 3000 is sure to find it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|01:57 (Sounds):
|(Clicking, beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|02:00 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Wow! I can't believe it worked. I mean, I can believe it worked, cause I made it. I'm a genius.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|02:08 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Ooh, good work, genius. Now, step aside so your beloved uncle can get super mayor powers from this... lousy bottle cap?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|02:15 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Harold, I thought you were a genius.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|02:18 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|I'd probably be more genius-y if I had the mighty building powers the meteor gave me. Can I at least get some help digging?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|02:27 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Kitties, help your cousin dig. I'm going back to Foggy Bottom to take a nap, call me if you find anything super.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|02:36 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Follow me, kitties. Let's search over here.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|02:39 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|If I could just get my super powers back, then I'll be the one charge, then I'll be the one who gets to take naps.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|02:46 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Except, I don't like naps, so I won't take them. (Cackling) Huh?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|02:54 Kitties:
|(Meowing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|02:55 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|(Gasping) I did it! I found a piece of the meteor.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:00 (Sound):
|(Explosion)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:01 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|All right, I'm super again. Now kitties, watch my awesome machine-making powers!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:10 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Check it out. It's a rocket-powered hover board, impressive, huh?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:16 (Scene) [[Kitten Catastrophe Crew]] ([[Cat Rubble]]):
|''(Hover board goes out of control and hits a lifeguard chair with Cat Rubble launching it in the air.)''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:22 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|(Gasping) Okay, that was impressive, too. How did you do that? (Kitties claws glow)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:28 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Oh, you have super powers too? This means you can be my super-powered hench kitties.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:35 [[Cat Rubble]] and [[Cat Marshall]]:
|(Muttering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:36 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Now, to put together my foolproof plan. Follow me to Foggy Bottom, hench-kitties. (Evil laughing) Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:48 Kittens:
|(Giggling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:51 [[Mr. Porter]]:
|(Humming) Whoa! Hi there, Kitty. No, no. This tuna is not for you.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|03:59 [[Mr. Porter]]:
|Wow! What kind of cat food have you been eating? Hey, my melons!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:04 [[Cat Chase]]:
|(Giggling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:07 [[Mr. Porter]]:

|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:13 (Sound):
|(Garbie bleating)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:14 [[Farmer Al]]:
|I'll be right back, Garbie. I just need to milk the cows.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:18 Cows:
|(Mooing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:22 [[Farmer Al]]:
|Huh? Instead of waiting for the milk, that itty-bitty kitty just took my whole herd.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:29 [[Wally]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:30 [[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Yep! The Flounder is full of fresh fish, Wally. Once I unload it, I'll treat you to a taste.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:35 [[Wally]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:39 [[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:41 [[Wally]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:42 [[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:47 [[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Oof! A flying furry feline? I'd better call the PAW Patrol.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:54 (Sound):
|(Phone ringing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:57 [[Ryder]]:
|Hi, Mr. Porter. What's going on?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|04:59 [[Mr. Porter]]:
|''Mayor Humdinger's kitty was moving super fast and took all my tuna.''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|05:04 [[Ryder]]:
|Oh! Hi, Farmer Al. What's up?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|05:06 [[Farmer Al]]:
|''Oh, my cows! A teeny, tiny kitty lifted them all up and carried them away.''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|05:11 [[Ryder]]:
|Cap'n Turbot? Let me guess. Kitty trouble?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|05:14 [[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|''Trouble is too timid a term. I've been fish-jacked by a flying feline who beached my boat to boot. It looked like it had...''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|05:20 [[Mr. Porter]], [[Farmer Al]] and [[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|''Superpowers!''

|Whoa!
|-

|Thanks for getting here so quickly, Mighty Pups. Somehow, Mayor Humdinger's kitties got superpowers.

|Kitties with superpowers? That makes me super sneezy just thinking about it. (Sneezing)
|-

|They're causing problems all over Adventure Bay. It'll take you Mighty Pups and your super paws to stop them.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|06:45 [[Rubble]]:
|All over town? Chase can go super fast, but how are the rest of us going to get there in time?
|-

|Mighty Chase, I need your super speed and super fast ride to catch up to that kitty, and to get back Mr. Porter's tuna using your energy net.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|07:06 [[Chase]]:
|These mighty paws uphold the laws!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|07:09 [[Ryder]]:
|And Mighty Rubble. I need you to use your super strength and mighty rig to push the Flounder back into the water. And when we find them, carry back Farmer Al's cows.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|07:17 [[Rubble]]:
|Mighty Rubble is ready for trouble!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|07:20 [[Ryder]]:
|Last, I'll need... Mighty Skye. I need you to use your whirlwind jet to return Cap'n Turbot's fish.
|-

|Whoa! (''In distance:'') That was a mighty nice nudge, Mighty Rubble.

|Yes! My super ride is back. So, hench-kitties, is it awesome or super awesome?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|09:11 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Hench-kitties? Where did they go?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|09:13 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|You got your superpowers back? You were supposed to call me. Hey! My Uncle Mayor-mobile looks ready to roll again.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|09:21 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Actually, it's now the Nephew Mayor-mobile. (Evil laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|09:26 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|What? That's a terrible name.
|-

|Ryder, Harold blasted right through my roadblock, and now he's headed into town.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:22 [[Ryder]]:
|We're on our way.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:23 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Help! Again!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:26 [[Ryder]]:
|But we also have a soggy mayor to re-rescue. Zuma?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:30 [[Zuma]]:
|''My mighty wave will get the save.''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:34 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Oh, my itty-bitty island is getting ittier and bittier.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:38 [[Zuma]]:
|Time to do the wave!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:44 (Sound):
|(Splashing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:44 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Help! Phew!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:49 (Sound):
|(Laser buzzing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:49 (Sound):
|(Engine revving)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:49 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Uh-oh.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:51 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Witness my genius, hench-kitties. When I laser my way to the other side of Adventure Bay, my new foolproof plan will be complete.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:00 Kittens:
|(Giggling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:04 [[Ryder]]:
|Mighty Pups, any sign of Harold?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:06 [[Rubble]]:
|No sign of him at the train station.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:08 [[Chase]]:
|He's not at the beach, either.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:12 [[Skye]]:
|I've got a visual.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:14 (Sound):
|(Laser buzzing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:14 [[Skye]]:
|(Gasping) I found Harold. He's heading towards Town Hall.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:18 [[Ryder]]:
|Great! Chase, speed up there and try to stop him.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:21 (Sound):
|(Laser buzzing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:22 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Almost there. We just need to cut a little bit more, and then Adventure Bay will be floating away.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:28 (Sound):
|(Laser buzzing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:32 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Oh, look at our beautiful tulip garden, Chickaletta. We just need to make a small trench for the water.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:38 [[Chickaletta]]:
|(Clucking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:39 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Oh, you're such a helpful chicken. Where did I put my shovel?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:44 (Sound):
|(Laser buzzing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:46 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Too deep, Chickaletta. Too deep!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:48 [[Chase]]:
|Your laser line ends here, Harold!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:51 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|''Whoa! Whoopsie!''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:54 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Well, at least I still have one beautiful tulip.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:58 (Sound):
|(Clanging)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:59 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Oh, this is a disaster. I'd better call the PAW Patr... ooh.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:04 [[Ryder]]:
|Don't worry, Mayor Goodway. The Mighty Pups are here.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:07 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Keep them busy, hench-kitties.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:08 Kittens:
|(Meowing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:11 [[Chase]]:
|Not so close, kitty. I'm super allergic. (Sneezing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:16 [[Rubble]]:
|Aw! What a cutie-wudie, itty-bitty, naughty kitty.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:21 Kittens:
|(Muttering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:22 [[Rubble]]:
|Hey! Paws off my rig.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:28 (Sound):
|(Rumbling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:30 Kittens:
|(Snickering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:31 [[Rubble]]:
|Okay. No more Mr. Nice Pup. That laser is going down.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:35 (Sound):
|(Engine revving)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:38 (Sound):
|(Laser buzzing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:42 [[Rubble]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:45 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|For those keeping score, Harold's Hench-Kitties, 2. Ryder's Puny Pups, zilch. (Cackling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:54 [[Ryder]]:
|We have to find a way to stop Harold, pups.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:56 [[Chase]]:
|But those super kitties keep throwing a wrench into our plans.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:59 [[Ryder]]:
|Wrench! That's it! Rocky, we need you and your energy tools, fast.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:04 [[Rocky]]:
|''Green means go!''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:08 [[Rocky]]:
|What do you need, Ryder?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:09 [[Ryder]]:
|The biggest, best kitty toy you can come up with. While they're busy playing with it, we can shut down Harold's laser.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:15 [[Rocky]]:
|One super kitty toy, coming up.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:19 [[Rocky]]:
|And done!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:22 [[Ryder]]:
|Nice! The kitties are going to love it.
|-

|''Hey, where are you going?''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:30 Kittens:
|(Meowing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:31 [[Ryder]]:
|Now's our chance. Chase, think you could beat them to the edge of the cliff?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:35 [[Chase]]:
|Watch me, if you can.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:39 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|(Sighing) Kitties, forget that silly toy mouse.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:44 (Sound):
|(Laser buzzing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:46 Kittens:
|(Meowing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:47 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Now, stop that pup.

|(Evil laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:59 [[Rocky]]:
|This town is about to get really wet.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:02 [[Ryder]]:
|(Gasping) I have an idea. If we use the satellite dish from the Mighty Tower and hold it in front of the beam, it'll deflect right back at the laser and destroy it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:13 [[Ryder]]:
|Catch!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:14 [[Skye]]:
|Time to go laser-beam-bouncing.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:19 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|One last step, and my island will be...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:22 (Sound):
|(Laser buzzing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:24 (Sound):
|(Banging)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:24 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Whoa! Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:29 (Sound):
|(Crashing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:31 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|You lasered my laser? How dare you ruin my second foolproof plan? No problem. I'll just rebuild it. Huh? Where'd my powers go? Hench-kitties, fetch the laser pointer.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:47 [[Cat Marshall]]:
|(Yawning)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:48 [[Cat Skye]]:
|(Meowing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:49 [[Harold Humdinger|Harold]]:
|Yours are gone, too? I don't get it. I have the meteor piece right here in my... Hey! Where'd it go?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:58 [[Skye]]:
|(Gasping) Ryder, Harold and the kitties lost their superpowers.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:02 (Sound):
|(Rumbling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:03 [[Chase]]:
|(Gasping) The ground is giving way.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:05 [[Ryder]]:
|We've got to keep it together or the town will float away.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:08 [[Rubble]]:
|It's just... too... big. Sorry, Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:13 [[Marshall]]:
|I heard the town could use a ruff-ruff rescue.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:16 Pups:
|Mighty Marshall!
