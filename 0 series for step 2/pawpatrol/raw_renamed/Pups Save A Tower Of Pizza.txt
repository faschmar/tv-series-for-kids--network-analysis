| class="transcript_time"|11:57 [[Chase]]:
|Rocky? Pizza dough on the go.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:02 [[Rocky]]:
|Pizza pie. Watch it fly.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:05 [[Ryder]]:
|And now for some sauce.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:08 [[Skye]]:
|And lots of cheese, if you please.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:11 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Yum. I love cheese.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:14 [[Ryder]]:
|Now it's ready to bake.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:16 [[Rubble]]:
|Hot pizza coming through.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:21 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Mmm! It smells pizza-licious. I could just gobble up a slice.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:26 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Mayor Goodway, we can't eat these pizzas yet. We need to make the world's tallest pizza tower so we can get our picture in the record book. See?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:37 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|And we shall win that trophy, Alex. I just hope the judge gets here while the pizzas are still warm. (Sniffing) Mm-mm-mmm!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:47 [[Mr. Porter]]:
|I'll get started on some more dough.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:49 [[Ryder]]:
|Thanks for bringing more soft cheese, pups.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:52 [[Marshall]]:
|Oops. Don't roll away, big cheese. Whoa.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|12:57 [[Marshall]]:
|Hey. Who turned out the lights?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:00 [[Mr. Porter]]:
|Oops.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:04 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Grandpa, we have to build the tallest pizza tower. We don't have time to play scary ghost.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:10 Everyone:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:12 [[Chase]]:
|Come on, pups. Let's win that trophy.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:16 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Pizza tower? Trophy? I'm going to win that trophy. Right, kitties?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:26 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|I'm so excited. The judge will be here any minute, and he'll be so thrilled to see our pizza tower.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:33 [[Chickaletta]]:
|(Clucking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:34 [[Farmer Al]]:
|And Garbie will be thrilled to eat a slice after the judging. Pizza is his favorite.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:39 [[Garbie]]:
|(Bleating)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:40 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|''Did someone say "pizza"?'' As in the world's tallest and most magnificent pizza tower?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:44 Citizen:
|Look at that.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:49 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|The trophy will say, "World's tallest pizza tower from the world's best town: Foggy Bottom, run by the world's best mayor." Me.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|13:59 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Aw. But I thought we were going to break the record and win the trophy.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:04 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|We will. Once the judge sees our tower is the tallest, the record will belong to Adventure Bay.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:10 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Don't count on it, Mayor Goodway, 'cause Foggy Bottom is in it to win it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:16 [[Chase]]:
|Everyone clear the way for the Adventure Bay Tower of Pizza.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:20 Citizen:
|Wow!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:24 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Gasps)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:25 Citizen:
|That's huge!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:30 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Drat. My tower isn't high enough. I'm never going to win that trophy.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:34 (Sound):
|(Car horn honking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:35 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|Hello. I thought I was only judging one tower of pizza. Ooh, so exciting. There are two.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:44 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Yes! Ours is taller.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:46 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Not if I can help it. Time for Plan B, kitties. You know what to do. (Cackling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:55 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|It's obvious the tallest pizza tower is--
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:58 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|We're going to win!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|14:59 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Wait, wait. Look, everyone. It's an amazing airborne pizza.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|15:06 Citizen:
|How in the world did that happen?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|15:08 [[Ryder]]:
|(Gasps)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|15:11 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|You may have heard of a flying saucer, but have you ever seen a flying pizza?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|15:16 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|That has nothing to do with the tallest tower of pizza.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|15:20 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|Ooh. I wonder if there's a record for flying pizza. Heh. Interesting.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|15:27 [[Ryder]]:
|Maybe we should keep an eye on it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|15:34 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Now, kitties, let's win that trophy. You know what to do.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|15:42 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|All we need to do is make the tower shorter, but no one can know it was us.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|15:46 [[Garbie]]:
|(Bleating)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|15:48 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Cackling) Garbie, lunchtime.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:03 Citizen:
|Flying pizza.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:08 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|Aha! So, it's just a flying kitten.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:11 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|A kitten? Oh, I should have known. Where is that Mayor Humdinger, anyway?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:21 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Cackling) Eat up. But don't touch my tower.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:26 Everyone:
|(Gasping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:28 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Our pizza tower. It's ruined!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:31 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|I'm afraid it's now a leaning tower of pizza. Oh, shoo. Shoo.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:36 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Shoo, shoo! Now we'll never win. The pizza tower is broken.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:41 [[Ryder]]:
|Get away. Eating all that pizza is going to give you tummy aches.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:46 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|Hey. I got to measure that tower. Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|16:56 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|Oh. I'm stuck. But now, I'm moving. Woo! (Laughing) Help!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:02 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Ryder, please help the judge.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:04 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|Whoa, whoa. Not liking this. Not liking this at all!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:09 [[Ryder]]:
|Don't worry. No pizza tower is too fast, no pup is too small.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:16 [[Ryder]]:
|PAW Patrol, to the Lookout.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:18 Pups:
|Ryder needs us!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:24 [[Marshall]]:
|Whoa.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:25 [[Rocky]]:
|Where's Marshall?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:26 [[Marshall]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:30 [[Marshall]]:
|Who wants pizza with extra pup-aroni?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:33 Pups:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:35 (Music):
|♪
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:51 [[Chase]]:
|PAW Patrol ready for action, Ryder, sir!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|17:55 [[Ryder]]:
|Thanks, pups. As you know, animals started eating our pizza tower, and now it's rolling with the judge all over Adventure Bay.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:02 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|''Help!''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:03 [[Ryder]]:
|So, for this mission, I'll need Skye. I'll need you to use your harness to lift the judge off the runaway pizza tower.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:10 [[Skye]]:
|Let's take to the sky!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:12 [[Ryder]]:
|And Chase. I'll need you to use your net to stop that tower before it causes any damage.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:18 [[Chase]]:
|Chase is on the case!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:20 [[Ryder]]:
|And Marshall. Use your water cannon to lead those critters away. They're going to be thirsty after all that pizza.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:26 [[Marshall]]:
|I'm fired up!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:28 [[Ryder]]:
|All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:31 Pups:
|(Barking, howling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|18:33 (Music):
|♪ (Deployment sequence for Skye and Chase)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:36 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|Somebody help me!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:39 [[Ryder]]:
|Skye, use your harness to carry the judge to safety.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:42 [[Skye]]:
|Roger, Ryder. (Barking) Harness.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:50 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|Now, that's a record-breaking rescue. Thanks.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|19:58 [[Ryder]]:
|Marshall, there's the raccoon. See if it'll take some water.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:02 [[Marshall]]:
|After all that pizza, I bet you'd like something to drink. (Barking) Water cannon.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:15 [[Ryder]]:
|Great. I'll put out some bowls to lead them back to the forest. You fill them up.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:19 (Sound):
|(Engine revving)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:21 [[Marshall]]:
|Drink up, and let's get you home.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:27 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|(Gasps) We'll get you down, kitty. Go on, kitties. Go help him. Do something.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:41 [[Mr. Porter]]:
|Not Mayor Goodway's tulip garden.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:45 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Huh? Chickaletta, come back. You shouldn't wander off so far. Especially now.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|20:51 [[Chase]]:
|I'm on it, Mayor Goodway. (Barking) Net.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:07 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|''Oh, my kitties!''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:09 [[Ryder]]:
|They're heading for the bridge. Come on, Chase.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:17 [[Chase]]:
|Uh-oh. That's not good.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:20 [[Ryder]]:
|Skye, we need your help.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:22 [[Skye]]:
|''I'm on my way!''
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:23 [[Chase]]:
|Hold on, kittens.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:26 [[Ryder]]:
|Skye, use your basket to rescue those kittens.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:29 [[Skye]]:
|You got it, Ryder.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:37 [[Ryder]]:
|Okay, kitties. Now, jump in.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:45 [[Chase]]:
|Phew. Close call.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:48 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|There goes another pizza. We'll never win that record now.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|21:53 [[Ryder]]:
|It's not over yet, Alex.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:00 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Ah. That's it. That's the last pizza.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:03 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|And that is the world's tallest pizza tower. A real record-setter.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:10 Everyone:
|(Cheering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:12 [[Mr. Porter]]:
|(Sighing) We had to make a bunch of new pizzas, but it was worth it.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:16 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|And now for the record-breaking photo.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:18 [[Mayor Goodway]]:
|Alex, would you like to do the honors?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:22 [[Chili and pizza judge|Judge]]:
|Congratulations. You're our youngest record-setter. Ha! That's a record, too.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:29 (Sound):
|(Shutter clicking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:31 [[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Woo-hoo! Thank you. And thank you, PAW Patrol, for saving the day.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:35 [[Ryder]]:
|You're welcome. Whenever you have a runaway pizza tower, just yelp for help.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:41 Everyone:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|22:44 [[Mayor Humdinger]]:
|Oh, I'm so sick of pizza. Ah. Aw!
