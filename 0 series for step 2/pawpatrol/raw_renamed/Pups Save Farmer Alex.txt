|That looks great, Rocky and Marshall!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Thanks! We've even put balloons along the race course.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Nice idea!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Uh-oh. This one's stuck.

|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|(Yelling) Oof! I'm good!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Sorry, you can't go this way! The road's closed for the big event!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mayor Goodway]]:
|This potato sack race will be so exciting! Who do you think will win?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|I dunno, Cap'n Turbot and Francois have been practicing for hours!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|I know this course completely! It pays to be perfectly prepared.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Francois Turbot|Francois]]:
|Perhaps, but your potato sack is no match for mine. Fashioned from the most beautiful, luxurious materials.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Hi, Farmer Yumi!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Farmer Yumi]]:
|Oh, hi, Alex!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|What are you up to? Anything I can do to help? I could drive the tractor, or paint the barn... or milk the cows, or--
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Farmer Yumi]]:
|Or, how about you help me feed the animals?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Now, that's a great idea!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Cool!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Farmer Al]]:
|(Panting) Hurry! The big race, the Tour De Turbot, is about to start!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Farmer Yumi]]:
|Peach fuzz! I nearly forgot! Come on, we don't want to miss the first hop!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|But I'm having so much fun! Can I stay and hang out with Skye, please?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Farmer Yumi]]:
|Well, I guess you could stay. If you don't mind keeping an eye on you-know-who, Skye.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Skye will keep an eye! (Yipping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Farmer Yumi]]:
|All righty. Don't forget, when I get back, we'll feed the animals.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Yay! (Giggling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|I'm tired of hopping. Let's do something else.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Do you want to go watch the race?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Nah... I know! Let's surprise Farmer Yumi, and feed the animals for her!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|But we don't know what they like to eat!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|I know! Let's make them a ginormous salad! There's a whole mess of vegetables right over there.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|My grandpa always tells me to eat my veggies, to grow up healthy and strong. And now, Farmer Yumi's animals will be healthy and strong, too!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Alex, I don't think Farmer Yumi wanted you to pick all those—- Oof—- Veggies...
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Animals:
|(Chomping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|(Laughing) See? The animals love my salad.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Heh-heh, looks like the floor loves it, too. Yuck!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Now, it's time for animal-robics!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Animal what now?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Animal-robics! If you want to be healthy, exercise like me! Hooves up! Now, wings! Let's go!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Okay, I'll go put the wagon away. I'll be right back.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Alex Porter|Alex]]:
|Yeah!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Cap'n Turbot]]:
|Good luck, Francois. May the best Turbot take the trophy.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Francois Turbot|Francois]]:
|Merci, I will. But don't worry, cousin. I'm sure you'll get second place.

|And we have to get Alex safely off Bettina, too.
|-

|Exactly. So, for this mission, I'll need Chase. I need you to use your megaphone and cones to safely herd those animals.

|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
