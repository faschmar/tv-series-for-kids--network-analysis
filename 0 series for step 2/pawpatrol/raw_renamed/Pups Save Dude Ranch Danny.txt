| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Yee-haw!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Horn honking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Get along, little dogies.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Don't you mean "doggies"?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Not "doggies." Dogies. "Dogie" is a word we cowboys use that means "a little cow."
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Oh. Sorry, Chase. Moo!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|Moo! (Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Lookie yonder, cow-pups. We're almost to the Wingnuts' Wild West Pony Park.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|I can't wait. I've always wanted to be a cow-pup and call myself Sheriff Chase.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|And I've always wanted to be a buckaroo riding a bucking bronco. I'm gonna record all the awesome action on my 10-callon hat cam. Much obliged for letting me come along.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|We're happy you could join us, Daring Danny X. I mean, partner.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Yippee-ki-ay!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Robo-Dog]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|We're here.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|Here come our guests, Lightning Bolt. Let's give 'em a Wild West howdy. That is, if I've gotten your wires uncrossed. Welcome to Wingnut's Wild West Pony Park! Say howdy, Lightning Bolt.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Electronic neighing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Cool.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Cool, a robo-bronco. Mr. Wingnut, you always make the coolest robot critters.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|Why, thank you, Rocky.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|So what kind of fun cowboy stuff can we do here? Any jobs for a sheriff?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|We haven't needed a sheriff yet, but we've got horseshoe tossing, a hay wagon, and a real deal Western trail ride!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Trail riding? That sounds like my kind of extreme cowboy fun! Which pony'll give me the wildest ride?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|Well, you could choose between Sweetfoot or Speedy Steve.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Speedy Steve! He sounds like the fastest.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Come on, Speedy Steve! Giddy up. Please? (Groaning)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Hey, Daring Danny. Isn't it fun ridding the range?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|I guess. Just wish Speedy Steve would go a little faster. Actually, a lot faster. The only action my cowboy hat cam has seen is one fluttery butterfly.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|Cheer up, buckaroo. We're heading for Wildflower Meadows. There's a whole heap of butterflies up there!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Flowers? Bor-ing. Come on, Speedy Steve, get galloping. Hyah!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Electricity crackling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|Whoa, whoa, whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|Looks like Lightning Bolt's got the giddy-ups!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Yeah, lucky.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|Ooh! Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Lightning Bolt:
|(Neighing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|We better help Mr. Wingnut.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Sweetfoot]]:
|(Neighing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Easy, there, Sweetfoot. Just settle down and turn the wagon around.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|Whoa! Oof! (Groaning) Mighty fine work with the horse, Sheriff Chase. I think you have a special touch.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Aw, shucks.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Lightning Bolt:
|(Neighing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Electricity crackling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|Looks like old Lightning Bolt's got a glitch in his get-along.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Everyone:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Awesome! That was like a rodeo trick. Can you show me how to do it?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|Oh, afraid not, cowpoke. In fact, we'd best head back to the ranch so I can fetch my robo-horse-fixin' tools.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Sure thing, Mr. Wingnut. We'll see Wildflower Meadows later.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Um, I'll stay here and keep an eye on Lightning Bolt.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Good idea, Deputy Daring Danny. Watch out for rustlers who might try to take him.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|(Laughing) I don't think you'll see any rustlers, but we've got our share of sneaky gophers!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|This is boring. I'm gonna get a selfie on the robot-horse. Look at me, everybody! It's Daring Danny X saying "yes-haw!" I wonder what would happen if I pushed one button. Cool! I must have fixed you.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Electricity crackling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Wow! Now this is a Daring-Danny-X-style ride! Woo-hoo! Coming through, gophers! Whoa, careful, Lighting Bolt. Don't want to step in those gopher holes! Whoa... whoa... whoa! I'm riding side-saddle!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Gopher:
|(Chattering)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|No! Lightning Bolt, stop! Hat cam, broadcast to Ryder!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|(Playing harmonica)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Howling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Cowboy concert's over, pups. We're here.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|Thanks, Ryder. Let me just fetch my toolbox and we can head back out.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Oh, boy, more harmonica music. (Howling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Mr. Wingnut]]:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Phone ringing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Danny? Where are you?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|I don't know. Lightning Bolt is out of control.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Lightning Bolt? I thought he was broken.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Well, I sort of fixed him. Help!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rocky]]:
|Danny must be broadcasting from his hat cam.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Yeah! So, how's the picture look?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|Kind of shaky and sideways, but it's very clear.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Rubble]]:
|So clear we can see you're heading for a cactus field!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Awesome! I mean, prickly.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Don't worry. We're on our way. No robo-horse is too fast; no pup is too small! PAW Patrol, to the PAW Patroller.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|Ryder needs us.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|(Playing harmonica) Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Marshall!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Whoa, there!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Crashing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Marshall]]:
|(Playing harmonica)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Laughing) (Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|PAW Patrol posse ready for action, Ryder, sir!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Much obliged, pups.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Beeping)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Daring Danny's on a runaway robo-horse.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|And we've got to do a roundup rescue. Skye, fly over the valley and find the cactus filed. Once you locate it, and Danny, let us know how to get there.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|This cow-puppy's got to fly!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Chase, you'll use your sip line like a lasso to stop that runaway robo-horse.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Sheriff Chase is on the case.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|PAW Patrol is on a roll!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Robo-Dog]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Pups:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|(Barking)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|(Laughing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Ryder, I found the cactus field. And there's Danny! He's just west of those rocky towers.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Great job, Skye. Chase and I are headed there now.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Siren wailing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|It looks way prickly ahead!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|We're closing in. Chase, Danny's moving around too much for you to be able to lasso his horse. Lasso the cactus instead and bend it out of the way.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Giddy up, four by four! (Barking) Zip line! Whoa, there, four by four.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Thank you! That was close! Hey, I think I see its off switch.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Lightning Bolt:
|(Snorting)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Looks more like a turbo booster. Hang on, Danny!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Siren wailing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Uh-oh. Danny's headed right toward those hoodoos.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|What are hoodoos?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Those!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Whoa! Whoa. Phew. No, Lightning Bolt. Horses can't climb stairs. Oh!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Electricity crackling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|But I guess you do. Phew. Whoa! (Whimpering) Help.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Siren wailing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Looks like the rocky tower might topple soon. We got to get Daring Danny down.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|But how?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Sheriff Chase, reckon you can use your special touch to ride old Lightning Bolt down off those hoodoos?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|No. I know I can.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Great! Skye, I need you to airlift Cheriff Chase onto Lightning Bolt's saddle.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Skye]]:
|Here comes the harness!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Hippee-ki—- whoa! Almost there. Now. Ah!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Sound:
|(Crackling)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Yee-haw!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Lightning Bolt:
|(Neighing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Whoa! Not again!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|I got this. Lightning Bolt may have lots of wires, but he still has the heart of a horse. Now hang on tight, 'cause now we're gonna... jump!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Oh, no! I meant... cool.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|So let's do it again.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Whoa! Whoa. Ah!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Easy, boy.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|You're doing great, Sheriff Chase. Just tow more to go!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|Then let's do it! Hee-yah!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Yee-haw! Alright! We made it! That was extreme!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Great job, Sheriff Chase.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Chase]]:
|'Tweren't nuttin'.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Lightning Bolt:
|(Neighing)
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Whoa, whoa, whoa!
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Sorry we're late. Speedy Steve and I stopped to get a little something to say thanks for making this the best Wild West day ever. Here. We picked these in Wildflower Meadows.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Ryder]]:
|Thanks, partner. If you ever have a lick of trouble, reckon you should just yelp for help.
|-
| class="transcript_time"|[[Danny]]:
|Huh?
|-
| class="transcript_time"|Everyone:
