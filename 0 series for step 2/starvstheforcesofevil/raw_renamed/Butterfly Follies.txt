|''Episode begins at a dungeon tower. [[Star Butterfly]] blasts a guard knight through a wall with wandless magic.''
|-
!Knight
|[screams]
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Oh! Not bad, me!
|-
!
|''More knights swing their weapons at Star. She dodges and fires back with more magic.''
|-
!Star
|Incoming!
|-
!
|''[[Marco Diaz]] fights off a knight with his sword, El Choppo. Marco looks behind him and ducks down. The knights that Star sent flying crash into the knight that Marco was fighting, and they fall down a flight of stairs.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Nice!
|-
!
|''As Marco and Star continue fighting, [[King Butterfly|King River]] sinks his teeth into another knight's leg.''
|-
![[King Butterfly|King River]]
|Tastes like chicken!
|-
!Star
|Glittery Heart Slap Blast!
|-
!
|''Star sends two more knights flying with a purple heart-shaped blast.''
|-
!Star
|Rainbow Fist Punch!
|-
!
|''She sends another knight flying into a wall with a fist of rainbow light. The knight's mace strikes his own face.''
|-
!Marco
|Look out!
|-
!
|''Another knight hurls a wrecking ball at Star, and she jumps out of the way. When Star hits the ground, her purse goes flying.''
|-
!Star
|My purse!
|-
!
|''Star catches her purse just as it flies out the tower window.''
|-
!Star
|Whew!
|-
!
|''The photo of Star and Marco's "Beach Day" slips out of the purse's open zipper.''
|-
!Star
|Noooo!
|-
!
|''Star jumps out the window, hangs from the ledge by her foot, and catches the photo.''
|-
!Star
|[sighs in relief]
|-
!Marco
|Come on, Star! [pulls Star back inside the tower]
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, and River run to the top of the tower and reach a door covered with a lot of locks and chains.''
|-
!Star
|I got this. Narwhal Blast!
|-
!
|''Star breaks the door down with a Narwhal Blast, and she, Marco, and River run inside.''
|-
!Star
|Mom?!
|-
!
|''A [[Mewmans|Mewman]] prisoner hangs upside-down from the wall.''
|-
!Prisoner
|[coughing] I'm not your mom.
|-
!Star and River
|What?
|-
!Marco
|Huh?
|-
!Warden
|For corn's sake, Star Butterfly! This is the third time you've ruined my prison tower! Couldn't you have used one of the holes you already made? [shows Star, Marco, and River two holes of the prison wall that are made by them before]
|-
!Star
|Uh, sorry. We just wanted to triple check to make sure we hadn't missed anything.
|-
!Warden
|I believe I told you before – let me say it again – [[Moon Butterfly|Queen Moon]]'s not here!
|-
!Prisoner
|You know, this is all your mom's fault anyway. Keeping secrets and conspiring with evil queens.
|-
!Star
|I know things are a little shaky right now, but it's not my mom's fault.
|-
!Prisoner
|Yeah, I suppose you're right. It's ''your'' fault!
|-
!Star
|Ugh!
|-
!Warden
|[tightens prisoner's bindings] Yes, the moment you're in charge, you just hand the whole kingdom over to the [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Queen of Darkness]] and her frozen [[Globgor|monster husband]]. [to prisoner] How's that feeling? Too tight?
|-
!Prisoner
|Oh, no, you— y-you could go tighter.
|-
!Warden
|Now with Queen Eclipsa in charge, I'm no longer allowed to imprison monsters. No. I've had to resort to imprisoning Mewmans, and... well, you know, I'm just not as passionate about that.
|-
!Star
|How about just not imprisoning anybody?
|-
!Warden
|How about you let me keep doing my job, and I'll let you keep ruining everything for everybody?
|-
!Star
|Fine!
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, and River leave.''
|-
!Warden
|Princesses. Am I right?
|-
!Prisoner
|[strained] Totally.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to tower exterior, inside a small canyon. [[Cloudy]] is sleeping with Star's bags on his back.''
|-
!Star
|[sighs] There's gotta be some place in [[Mewni]] we haven't checked yet.
|-
!
|''Marco holds a map of Mewni with a lot of X-marks on it. He makes another X-mark.''
|-
!Marco
|I don't know, Star. We're running out of options. [sniffs, looks at River, shudders] We could go to the Hot Springs again. It's been awhile since some of us have showered.
|-
!River
|[shoves Marco's face in his chest, laughs] Drink in that musk, boy. Ha-ha! That's all natural.
|-
!Marco
|[pulls away] Okay! [groans]
|-
!
|''Star's compact mirror phone starts ringing.''
|-
!Marco
|You want to know why hygiene is important? It's because the world is a petri dish of bacteria!
|-
!
|''Star answers the phone call to see [[Tom Lucitor]].''
|-
!Star
|Tom!
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|How's the search goin' today?
|-
!Star
|Oh, it's goin' great! We got tons of leads!
|-
!Tom
|Isn't that the same tower you checked twice already?
|-
!Star
|Uh, noooo! What do you know about towers? You live underground.
|-
!Tom
|There ''are'' towers in the Underworld, you know?
|-
!Star
|Sorry, sorry. You're right, Tom. You're not stupid.
|-
!Tom
|You never said I was stupid.
|-
!Star
|Well, not out loud.
|-
!Tom
|[laughs] Okay. That's the Star I miss.
|-
!Star
|Miss you, too, Boo! See ya soon! [closes phone]
|-
!Marco
|...And then, when you go to eat the sandwich, your fingers are gonna touch the food you eat in your mouth.
|-
!
|''Marco's phone starts ringing. He answers it.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey, man.
|-
!Tom
|(''o.s.'') Hey, Marco...
|-
!Star
|We've looked at this a million times.
|-
!River
|Maybe we've been looking at it all wrong.
|-
!Tom
|(''o.s.'') I just want to make sure. You know I know what a tower is, right?
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, I know you know what a tower is.
|-
!Tom
|(''o.s.'') So you'll be home at some point, right?
|-
!Marco
|Think she still wants to re-check a few more places, but we're running out of options.
|-
!Tom
|(''o.s.'') Did she call me stupid?
|-
!Three-Eyed Monster
|Hey, you there! Is everything okay?
|-
!Star
|Uh, yeah. We're kind of in the middle of something.
|-
!Three-Eyed Monster
|Oh, my bad! I thought you fell down and broke all your bones. Ignore me!
|-
!
|''The monster starts walking away. The back of his T-shirt bears Queen Butterfly's image.''
|-
!Star
|Wait a second! Wait! Wait-wait-wait-wait! Hey-hey-hey, monster dude! Your shirt!
|-
!
|''Star runs up to the monster and pulls on his shirt.''
|-
!Three-Eyed Monster
|Whoa! What'd I do?!
|-
!
|''The back of the monster's T-shirt has Moon's face and reads "COME SEE ME AT THE PIE CARNIVAL!"''
|-
!Star
|[Star] It's... It's her!
|-
!River
|Moooon!
|-
!Marco
|[reading] "Come see me at the Pie Carnival."
|-
!River
|[grunts] Pie Carnival!
|-
!Marco
|Why would your mom be at a Pie Carnival?
|-
!Star
|She's probably confused. The time she spent in the [[Realm of Magic]] really did a number on her memory.
|-
!Three-Eyed Monster
|Wait a minute! Are you Star Butterfly?!
|-
!Star
|What? Oh!
|-
!Three-Eyed Monster
|[vigorously shakes Star's hand] It is an honor to meet you!
|-
!Star
|Oh! [laughs] It's nice to meet you, too. But about the Pie Carnival...
|-
!Three-Eyed Monster
|Yeah, the Pie Carnival. [chuckles] Oh, they hate monsters there! But they gotta deal with us now, you know? Ever since you gave the kingdom back to Eclipsa, you've given us monsters a chance to live a normal life again!
|-
!Star
|Oh. Well, I guess I was just doing what felt like the right thing to do.
|-
!Three-Eyed Monster
|You did good, Princess. Too bad your mom was such a dum-dum!
|-
!River
|You take that back about my wife!
|-
!Star
|Dad, wait! He knows where Mom is! Uh, monster dude? Please, can you tell us how to get to the Pie Carnival?
|-
!Three-Eyed Monster
|Oh, yeah, didn't I say? I guess I didn't— I was very excit— It's just over that hill!
|-
!Star
|Okay, thanks! Bye!
|-
!River
|Wait!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco run to the carnival grounds. The entrance sign reads "PIE CARNYVALE".''
|-
!Star
|"Pie Carn-ya-val-lay. Now with Queen Moon." My mom is Queen Moon!
|-
!
|''Star runs into the carnival, pulling Marco along.''
|-
!River
|Wait! Wait! [tackles Marco to the ground]
|-
!Star
|Dad, Mom's here.
|-
!River
|Aah! Pie Carnival! Danger! Pie Folk!
|-
!Star
|Pie Folk?
|-
!River
|Pie Folk! The sleaziest scammers in all of Mewni. What may seem like a fun carn-ya-val is but a trap to take everything you have. Your horse! Your carriage! Your wedding ring!
|-
!Star
|Did this, uh... happen to you?
|-
!River
|I was trying to win a boombox. But now they've taken my wife!
|-
!Star
|Well, say what you want about the Pie Folk. But if Mom's here, I'm going. [walks away]
|-
!River
|Honey, wait! Wear a money belt! She's doomed.
|-
!Marco
|Uh, w-w-w-wait a sec. Look, we've been questing for weeks, and I haven't had a proper meal. Let's get some food.
|-
!River
|You just touched my beard!
|-
!Marco
|C'mon, man. You're, like, the hungriest guy I know. You gotta be starving, too!
|-
!River
|Of course I'm starving. I'm starving for my wife! [whimpers] My wife.
|-
!Marco
|Uhhh...
|-
!River
|We'll eat a proper meal at home after we find Moon!
|-
!Marco
|I'm just talking about a snack, dude. This place is full of pies!
|-
!River
|Full of pies? [bites a leg of meat] Full of lies!
|-
!Marco
|You... You have food? River! Is that a drumstick?!
|-
!
|''River passes by a pie stand. Marco stops in front of the same stand.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey. Can I, uh... Can I get one of these pies?
|-
!Elderly Pie Folk Woman
|They're six-fifty.
|-
!Marco
|Wait. Six dollars and fifty cents, or six hundred and fifty dollars?
|-
!Elderly Pie Folk Woman
|[smiles]
|-
!Marco
|I don't care. I'm hungry. But you better throw in a napkin.
|-
!River
|Marco, no! I told you not to eat the pies! They're stuffed with nothing but balderdash and humbug! And [muttering gibberish]! I'm onto you.
|-
!Marco
|[picks up pie and leaves $650] Look, man, I'm eating this pie.
|-
!
|''River flings his crown at the pie in Marco's hand, causing it to go flying. The crown twirls back onto River's head, and he walks away. Star walks up to a tall Pie Folk man and pulls on the back of his suspenders.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, hey, sorry to bother you. Have you seen my mom?
|-
!
|''The man turns his neck 180 degrees to look at Star.''
|-
!Pie Folk Man
|Uh, that depends. Who's your mom?
|-
!Star
|Queen— Uh, ''former'' Queen Moon Butterfly.
|-
!Pie Folk Man
|Ohhhhh! [bows to Star] Forgive me for being so common, milady! Your mama... Uh, I mean, Queen Moon is over at the meet and greet. I'll walk you over. Hold my pie, would ya?
|-
!Marco
|[holds man's pie] Sure.
|-
!
|''The Pie Folk man pulls up on his pants and leads Star, Marco, and River over to the meet-and-greet area just a few feet away. A sign reads a chair reads "MEET MOON", and a sign over the chair with Moon's face on it reads "CLOSED".''
|-
!Pie Folk Man
|There it is! Problem is meet and greet is closed. I gotta go. That'll be six-fifty for the pie.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, right. [laughing, gives $650 to the man] There ya go.
|-
!
|''Star looks emotional at the "CLOSED" sign of Moon's face.''
|-
!Merchant
|Excuse me, miss. Did I hear you're looking for Queen Moon?
|-
!Star
|Yes! Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes, yes, yes! Oh, please tell me you know where she is!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to interior of the merchant's tent, where multiple pieces of Queen Butterfly merchandise are on display.''
|-
!Merchant
|Welcome to the exclusive Queen Moon Merchandise store! Or shall I say... Moon-chandise! Here we have all your Queen Moon merchandise needs! Including thirteen different types of Moon Dolls! Our newest addition is the Supportive Mom Moon Doll! [pulls doll's string]
|-
!Moon Doll
|You're doing just fine, sweetheart.
|-
!Star
|No! We don't want your dumb merchandise!
|-
!River
|[holding a lot of Moon Dolls] Maybe just... one or two.
|-
!Star
|I thought you said you hated the Pie Folk.
|-
!River
|Yes, but do I hate the Pie Folk more than I love my wife?
|-
!Star
|Ugh!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco leave the tent.''
|-
!Star
|She's everywhere.
|-
!
|''Around the carnival, people have Queen Moon merchandise and stand next to Queen Moon cardboard standees.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Just look around. They all love my mom.
|-
!Merchant
|Sounds like you need a Supportive Mom Moon Doll.
|-
!
|''Star buys a Moon Doll from the merchant and hugs it.''
|-
!Star
|I thought giving the kingdom back to Eclipsa was the right thing to do. But... I don't know. Did I... Did I blow it?
|-
!Marco
|You were Queen, and you made a decision. [takes Moon Doll from Star and drops it on the ground] Some people might just need some time to get used to it.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco hear fanfare. A man on a stage playing [[Manfred]] addresses an audience.''
|-
!"[[Manfred]]"
|Fellow Mewmans! Let us tell you a tale... one that we all know too well.
|-
!River
|Maybe this will take my mind off of things.
|-
!"Manfred"
|The Butterfly Follies!
|-
!
|''The theater curtains open to reveal a man playing a dull caricature of King River, with a pie on his head.''
|-
!"River"
|Ho-ho-ho! Being king of Mewni is the easiest job I've ever married into!
|-
!Crowd
|[laughing]
|-
!River
|Who... Who is this idiot?
|-
!"River"
|[belches] All hail your king!
|-
!Crowd
|[laughing and booing]
|-
!River
|Oh, no! It's me! ''I'm'' the idiot?!
|-
!"River"
|I'm all out of fooood! What do I do?!
|-
!Crowd
|There's a pie on your head!
|-
!"River"
|Oooh! There's a pie on my head?
|-
!
|The actor playing River stands up, and the pie on his head falls off. When he tries to catch it, he stumbles and falls onto it face-first.''
|-
!Crowd
|[laughing]
|-
!Mewman Man
|[laughing hysterically] I can't! I can't! He's so dumb! He's just like the real King River!
|-
!River
|[shoves Mewman man away] This is an outrage!
|-
!Star
|[sighs] Let's get out of here. We don't have to watch this.
|-
!
|''An actress playing a goofy caricature of Star Butterfly appears on stage hanging from a rope.''
|-
!"Star"
|Papa! Save some pie for me! Star Butterfly!
|-
!Crowd
|[booing]
|-
!Star
|Oh, no.
|-
!"Star"
|I'm here to destroy the great Butterfly legacy with my love of monsters! [falls on her butt]
|-
!Crowd
|[laughing]
|-
!"River"
|But, dear! What about your responsibilities to the Mewmans?
|-
!"Star
|Here's what I got to say about Mewmans! Narwhal Blast! [farts]
|-
!Crowd
|[laughing]
|-
!Star
|That's not how the Narwhal Blast works.
|-
!Marco
|Hey. Let's... Let's leave.
|-
!Star
|No. No-no-no-no. No-no. I want to see where they take this.
|-
!Marco
|But I don't! What do you think they're gonna do to me?
|-
!"Star"
|What's that I hear? I think my best friend is about to make an appearance! It's... Horseface!
|-
!
|''The actress playing Star reveals a [[Pony Head]] puppet on her head.''
|-
!Crowd
|[laughing]
|-
!"Star"
|My only friend! [imitates Pony Head] Girl, you know I'm so sassy! Hee-haw!
|-
!
|''Marco looks sad.''
|-
!Moon
|(''o.s.'') You two always make such a mess!
|-
!
|''A spotlight shines onto the stage.''
|-
!"Star" and "River"
|Oh, no!
|-
!Moon
|(''o.s.'') But do not worry.
|-
!
|''Queen Moon appears from behind the stage backdrop.''
|-
!Crowd
|[gasps]
|-
!Moon
|Your Queen is here!
|-
!Crowd
|[cheering]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to black. Cut back to Queen Moon on stage.''
|-
!Crowd
|[cheering] We love you, Moon! The rightful queen of Mewni! All hail Queen Moon!
|-
!River
|Moonpie!
|-
!Marco
|Is that really her?
|-
!Star
|It has to be! [runs to the stage]
|-
!Marco
|Star, what are you doing?!
|-
!Star
|Mama! Mama! It's me, Star!
|-
!
|''The theater music stops playing, and Moon stares at Star. Star climbs onto the stage.''
|-
!Star
|You're here! [hugs Moon] Mmm!
|-
!Moon
|Um, excuse me?
|-
!Star
|You don't remember me, but this hug feels good right now.
|-
!Elderly Man in Crowd
|Who is that?
|-
!Man in Crowd
|What's going on?
|-
!Moon
|Who... Who are you?
|-
!Star
|Mom, you were in a magical dimension. You lost your memory. There was a unicorn?
|-
!Moon
|[in complete shock] Um...
|-
!Star
|I know it doesn't make any sense, but you're my mom.
|-
!"Star"
|Indeed! Queen Moon is like a mom to us all!
|-
!Star
|No, she is actually my mother! I am the real Star Butterfly!
|-
!"Star"
|Well, I've got the wand! But I don't know how to use it!
|-
!Crowd
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''Star blasts away the actress playing her with a Heart Blast.''
|-
!Crowd
|[gasps]
|-
!Star
|I don't need a wand.
|-
!Man in Crowd
|It's the real Star Butterfly! Get her!
|-
!Crowd
|[shouting and throwing pie]
|-
!Star
|I'm sorry...
|-
!
|''Star and Moon duck under flying pieces of pie.''
|-
!Star
|...but I need to queen-nap you! [grabs Moon and runs away] You make terrible pies!
|-
!River
|You tell them, sweetie!
|-
!Marco
|We gotta go! [grabs River and runs away]

!
|''Star, Moon, Marco, and River are chased out of town by an angry mob with pitchforks.

!River
|We'd love to stay, but we don't want to!

!Star
|Mom! [hugs Moon]
|-
!River
|Moonpie! [hugs Moon]
|-
!Star and River
|Mmm!
|-
!River
|You've come back to me. [teary-eyed] I was so scared I would forget your face, but you're as beautiful as I...
|-
!
|''River brushes Moon's face with his hand, and her cheek mark smears on his fingers.''
|-
!River
|...remembered... Uh... [mutters]

!"Moon"
|Um, I have to tell you something.

!
|''"Moon" takes off his wig, revealing himself to be another Butterfly Follies actor.''

!Star and River
|[gasp]
|-
!River
|You... cut your hair?
|-
!Erik
|No, I'm not— [clears throat, in normal voice] I'm not the real Queen Moon. My name is Erik. [chuckles nervously] Sorry I didn't tell you earlier. I was trying not to break character.
|-
!Star
|We were so close! [crying]
|-
!Marco
|Oh, my gosh! You have a gift! This is the most flawless contouring I've ever seen!
|-
!Erik
|I used my new luminizer to highlight my cheekbones.
|-
!Marco
|Sometimes Turdina likes to highlight with glitter.
|-
!Erik
|I like to use glitter on my eyelids to make 'em pop!
|-
!Marco
|Sometimes I'll put a little bronzer on, and then blend it with my—
|-
!Star
|MARCO! We don't have time for this!
|-
!Erik
|Oh, my gosh. Can I just say it's an honor to meet the real Star Butterfly? What does it feel like knowing you single-handedly ruined your kingdom?
|-
!Marco
|Look, she's been through a lot, and she really doesn't need this from you.
|-
!Star
|Argh!
|-
!
|''Star transforms Erik into a frog/flying squirrel.''

|Wait!

!
|''Erik leaps off a cliff and starts to glide. He lands on the back of a crow, and they fly away.''
|-
!Star
|[sighs] Great, one more thing I messed up.
|-
!Marco
|[wistfully] Erik...
|-
!Star
|I guess the only thing left to do is retrace our steps and start searching all over again.
|-
!Marco
|Or... we could go home.
|-
!Star
|Oh, you mean give up?
|-
!Marco
|It's just that we've been out here for a while. We'll be more efficient if we're well-rested.
|-
!Star
|[moans]
|-
!Marco
|Hey. I promise we're not quitting. Just washing days of funk off our bodies. Or in River's case, weeks of funk.
|-
!River
|[scratches his armpit, chuckling]
|-
!Star
|Let's go home.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to "New Monstertown", a monster village at the base of the Monster Temple mountain. Star, Marco, and Cloudy enter the village while River makes a bed out of dirt.''
|-
!Star
|Come on, Dad. Not again.
|-
!River
|I have no home without my Moonpie! I'm sleeping outside tonight!
|-
!Marco
|Just leave him. It's not our fault if he wants to be a drama king.
|-
!Star
|Ugh, fine. I guess you're right.
|-
!
|''In front of the Monster Temple, Eclipsa uses the [[Royal Magic Wand]] for floral decoration.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Hey, Eclipsa!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, Star! Marco! Welcome back! Any luck finding your mother?
|-
!Star
|[sighs] No.
|-
!Eclipsa
|You know, have you checked the tower down the way?
|-
!Star
|I've checked the tower.
|-
!Marco
|[whispering] Three times.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, you never can be too thorough.
|-
!Cloudy
|You want to bet?
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!Star
|[poofs Cloudy away] The castle's really coming along.
|-
!Eclipsa
|It's a work in progress. Luckily, I've had lots of help from my transition team. I'd be lost without them.
|-
!Archibald
|[holding tray of drinks] Fresh lemonade, milady?
|-
!Elegant Lizard Monster
|Thank you, Archibald.
|-
!
|''The [[laser puppies]] come running out of the temple.''
|-
!Star
|Aah, puppies! Aw, did you miss us?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Let's head inside. You must be tired.

!Marco
|Actually, I could really go for some food.

!
|''Star and Marco enter the temple. [[Butterfly Castle]] stands ruined and abandoned in the background. Cut to temple interior; the Mewni royal guard march past a mounted wall portrait of Eclipsa.''

!Guards
|Left. Left. Left, right, left.

!Eclipsa
|(''o.s.'') Where's your father? Still camping off-site?

!
|''Star, Marco, and Eclipsa walk through the temple foyer.''

!Star
|You know my dad. He's processing things slowly.
|-
![[Sir Lavabo]]
|[gives clean clothes to monster] Princess Star! I mean, Regular Star! How goes the search for your mother?
|-
!Star
|It's going. Just... taking some time to recharge.
|-
!Lavabo
|Did you check that tower?
|-
!Marco
|So, Lavabo, how are things going here?
|-
!Lavabo
|I am busy performing my royal duties as always.
|-
![[Slime Monster]]
|Mmm. Fresh linen smell.
|-
!Lavabo
|I am... still getting used to seeing the fruits of my labor defiled. [chuckling]
|-
![[Manfred]]
|[panting] Oh, Star! Did you find your mother? Things have been a bit, uh... different in her absence.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Star, might I borrow you for a second?

!
|''Eclipsa guides Star and Marco to Globgor's chamber. Monsters chip away at the crystal with pickaxes.''

|That is... not working.
|-
!Eclipsa
|No, it's not. But I just can't help but try everything I can to bring him back. You know what that's like.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, I do.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Let's get you settled in.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa leads Star and Marco to a room covered in skulls and candles.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|I'm afraid your rooms aren't quite ready yet. Things have been a bit hectic around here.
|-
!Marco
|Ha-ha-ha! Don't worry about it. I'm just happy to sleep in a real bed for once.
|-
!
|''Marco lies down on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed. Something under the covers pops up, crawls around under the bed and on the walls, and scurries up the wall; it's [[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]]. On the ceiling, Meteora turns her head 180 degrees and screeches at Star.''
|-
!Star
|[shudders]
|-
!Eclipsa
|There's my baby! Come to Mama!
|-
!
|''Meteora jumps from the ceiling and into Eclipsa's arms.''
|-
!Meteora
|[baby talk]
|-
!Eclipsa
|[cooing]
|-
!Marco
|Aw, baby Meteora. Long time no see.
|-
!
|''Meteora stares at Marco with a sinister gaze.''
|-
!Marco
|Uh... a-are you sure she doesn't remember anything from before?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Of course not! At least I hope not. That'd be bad for all of us, wouldn't it?
|-
!
|''Star casts the All-Seeing Eye [[Spells|spell]] off-screen.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh! Would you look at that? My old spying spell! Back to work already, Star?
|-
!Star
|Yup. May as well start quadruple-checking all the places.
|-
!Eclipsa
|That's... very thorough of you. But don't work yourself too hard. You need some time to rest.
|-
!Star
|Ugh! This is pointless! [jumps off bunk bed, runs off]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Star, wait!
|-
!Star
|Okay, she's somewhere. But where is where?! Ugh, I don't know what to do!
|-
!
|''Star finds [[Glossaryck]] pouring salt into a pudding cup. She pulls up a chair and in front of him and sits backwards in it.''
|-
!Star
|Okay. Glossaryck, here's what's goin' down. I need your help, but I don't have time for any of your weird riddles. I am going to ask you a question, and you are going to answer it, okay?
|-
![[Glossaryck]]
|Okay.
|-
!Star
|I think the reason I can't find my mom is because something happened to her when we went to the magic dimension. But I can hardly remember what even happened there. What did the magic do to my mom?
|-
!Glossaryck
|You're asking the wrong question. The real question is, what were you doing in the magic dimension at all? That was your first mistake.
|-
!Star
|What are you talking about? I ''had'' to go there to find my mom! Just like I ''had'' to go there to defeat [[Toffee]]!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Maybe that was a mistake, too.
|-
!Star
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to another room where Meteora is bouncing up and down in a baby jumper and Eclipsa is folding clothes with Marco.''
|-
!Meteora
|[baby sounds]
|-
!Eclipsa
|I'm worried about Star. If she can't even find Moon with the All-Seeing Eye, well, it's not a good sign.
|-
!Marco
|But she was in a dimension of pure magic! I mean, maybe there's some kind of interference or something?
|-
!Eclipsa
|That doesn't really change how my spell works, Marco. I'm afraid someone will have to have a very difficult conversation with Star.
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] I know. There's just never a good time.
|-
!
|''Star passes by the door of the room Eclipsa and Marco are in.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Now might be a good time.
|-
!
|''Cut to Star in her pajamas, sitting on the bunk bed's top bunk and staring at a photo in her hands. There's a knock at the door. Star turns to face Marco, also in his pajamas.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey. Could we, uh... chat?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, sure, what's up?
|-
!Marco
|[sits next to Star] So... how is... you? I mean... I mean, how is you are doing?
|-
!Star
|Ugh, you are so bad at small talk. Just get to it.
|-
!Marco
|Okay, okay. It's just... we've searched everywhere in the kingdom for your mom, but we never seem to get any closer to finding her. Have you ever worried that maybe there's a... a tiny chance that... we might never find her?
|-
!Star
|Nope. We'll find her. I know it.
|-
!Marco
|But how can you possibly know that?
|-
!Star
|Because I have this. [gives photo to Marco]
|-
!Marco
|A picture of us that says "Beach Day"?
|-
!Star
|Look closely, Marco. ''When'' exactly did we go to that beach?
|-
!Marco
|What is this?
|-
!Star
|It's a gift from [[Father Time]]. It's from the future.
|-
!Marco
|What?!
|-
!Star
|Father Time gave it to me, and I keep it with me because sometimes I need a reminder—
|-
!Marco
|Oh, my gosh, this was on our fridge! How long have you had this thing?! That's, like, so many levels of time paradox!
|-
!Star
|Just listen, okay?! I don't know how, but someday soon, we're gonna have this awesome beach day, and there's no way I'd be this happy if we never found my mom.
|-
!Marco
|Huh. Well... I'm not keen on paradoxes, but you do look pretty happy in that photo. Still a paradox, though. Let's get some rest. The sooner we find your mom, the sooner we get to go to the beach.
|-
!
|''Marco lays down on the bottom bunk and kicks Star's mattress above him, making her jump.''
|-
!Marco
|Good night.
|-
!Star
|Night night, Marco. [turns off bed lamp] Good night, future Star. [puts Beach Day photo under her pillow]
|-
!
|''As Star stares at the ceiling, paper crinkles loudly off-screen. In the bed under her, Marco unwraps one of the Pie Carnival pies and is about to eat it.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] You bought one of their pies?! [falls out of bed] Aah!
|-
!Marco
|Star! I'm tired of corn, okay? Don't judge me.
|-
!Star
|Those pies are garbage, so, yes, I will judge you.
|-
!Marco
|[eats pie] Mm! Mmm! Star, you should try this. It's actually pretty good!
|-
!Star
|Yeah, who am I kidding? I'm not above garbage.
|-
!
|''Marco gives the pie to Star, and she notices the butterfly shape in the top of the crust.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Marco!
|-
!
|''Star punches Marco in the gut, causing him to spit out the piece of pie he was chewing. She places the chewed piece back in its original place in the pie.''
|-
!Star
|Over, under, around, and through! Grab the little Mewni rabbit, pull him through!
|-
!Marco
|What are you doing?
|-
!Star
|The crust! It's just how my mom makes it! She made them all the time when I was a little girl!
|-
!Marco
|So, do you think... ?
|-
!Star
|Yes.
|-
!
|''Star turns the pie over. The bottom of the pie tin reads "BAKED FRESH ON PIE ISLAND".''
|-
!Star
|My mom made these pies.
|-
