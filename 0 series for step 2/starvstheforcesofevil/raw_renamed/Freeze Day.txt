|''Episode begins at the [[Diaz Household]]. In the bathroom, [[Star Butterfly|Star]] straightens her red horned headband in the mirror.''
|-
!Star Butterfly
|Eh.
|-
!
|''Using her [[Star Butterfly's wand|magic wand]], Star cycles through several different headbands: a flower headband...''
|-
!Star
|Ugh.
|-
!
|''...a pirate hat...''
|-
!Star
|Uhh.
|-
!
|''...a red fez with a gold tassel...''
|-
!Star
|Eh.
|-
!
|''...a blue unicorn horn and mane...''
|-
!Star
|Ugh.
|-
!
|''...and a green cactus headband.''
|-
!Star
|Ah! Cacti for the win.
|-
!
|''[[Marco Diaz|Marco]] bursts into the bathroom as [[laser puppies]] yap around his feet. He rushes up to the mirror and shoves Star out of the way.''
|-
!Marco Diaz
|[screams] Out of the way! I overslept! I'm gonna be late!
|-
!
|''Marco briefly rummages through things on a nearby shelf. He brushes his teeth with a hairbrush and his hair with a toothbrush. Behind him, the laser puppies scurry around shooting lasers in random directions.''
|-
!Marco
|Ah! Where's my hoodie?!
|-
!Star
|Whoa, chill, Marco. We can still get to school by first period.
|-
!
|''Marco puts his red hoodie on backwards and pulls the hood off his face.''
|-
!Marco
|This isn't about learning! This is about love.
|-
!
|''Flashback to Marco standing next to the [[Echo Creek Academy]] lockers. He looks at his phone while straightening his hair. His phone clock reads "7:56".''
|-
!Marco
|(''v.o.'') Every day, I get there by 7:55, because at exactly 7:56, [[Jackie Lynn Thomas]] gets there.
|-
!
|''Jackie skates up to Marco on her skateboard. She skates past him.''
|-
!Marco
|(''v.o.'') And we share a nod.
|-
!
|''Marco nods to Jackie. Jackie nods back and continues skating away.''
|-
!Marco
|(''v.o.'') It's kind of our thing.
|-
!Marco
|[sighs]
|-
!
|''Cut back to Diaz Household bathroom – present day. Star's eyes are wide with affection.''
|-
!Star
|Awww... Wait. A nod? You don't even say hi?
|-
!Marco
|I'm working up to that.
|-
!
|''Marco takes a folded-up paper out of his pocket and unfolds it.''
|-
!Marco
|See? It's all a part of my 23-step plan. I'm already on step 4: nodding every day.
|-
!Star
|Hmm.
|-
!
|''A laser puppy shoots its lasers at Marco's hands.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey! Down, boy! [falls over] Bad laser puppy! [looks at clock] It's 7:54! I can't make it! Can't you just... uh, uh, magically stop time or something?
|-
!Star
|[scoffs, laughs] Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Easy Peasy Time Freezie.
|-
!
|''A magic ticking clock effect appears over Star and Marco. The laser puppies' movements and barking slow to a halt. In the kitchen, [[Mrs. Diaz]] flips a pancake; the pancake freezes in midair. In the shower, [[Mr. Diaz]]—wearing his Viking helmet and holding a rubber duck—sings opera; his singing slows down and stops. Marco touches one of the laser puppies' lasers mid-fire with one of his fingers then he puts his hurt finger in his mouth to heal it.''
|-
!Marco
|Ow! Do you know what you just did? 
|-
!Star
|Uh... froze time?
|-
!Marco
|You froze time! [touching Star excitedly] Now I can get to school and nod at Jackie! Hurry!
|-
!Star
|School? [touches Marco's face] But it's a [singsong] freeze day!
|-
!
|''Marco's eyes widen with excitement. As the two run out the front door jumping and laughing, a time-frozen laser puppy chases a time-frozen mailman. Star uses her magic to give an infant a mustache.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''Star gives everyone in the area mustaches. Later, at a birthday party for [[Amy Vendrosian|Amy]], a little girl in one of [[Charlie Booth]]'s foreign exchange families, Star and Marco eat birthday cake. Star has a lit candle on her tongue.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''Later, at the school, [[Lars Vanderdud|Lars]] gives a nerdy-looking kid a wedgie. Marco frees the kid from the wedgie, and Star gives Lars an atomic wedgie. Later, Star and Marco have a picnic on top of a car in the middle of a freeway.''
|-
!Star
|Yee-hee!
|-
!Marco
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''Later, in Marco's dojo, Star and Marco laugh while [[Jeremy Birnbaum]] is in the middle of a flying kick. Marco slaps him off-screen. Later, as [[Ludo]] emerges from a dimensional portal, Star switches his skull crown with her cactus headband. Marco takes a picture of Ludo wearing the cactus headband. Star and Marco return to the school.''
|-
!Marco
|[laughing] That was the funnest sixty hours of my life!
|-
!Star
|Oh, hey, there's frozen Jackie!
|-
!Marco
|I better get into optimal nod position.
|-
!
|''Marco straightens his hair and leans against the lockers.''
|-
!Marco
|Ready.
|-
!Star
|...Or maybe now's the time to move on to the next step of your crazy plan. [o.s., singsong] You could talk to her...!
|-
!Marco
|[looks at Jackie, stammering] T-The wind isn't right. I've got a pimple coming in. Uh, I'll just do the nod today.
|-
!Star
|[disappointed] Okay... Easy Peasy Time Unfreezie!
|-
!
|''Nothing happens. Time remains frozen.''
|-
!Star
|Huh. Easy Peasy Time Unfreezie!
|-
!
|''Still nothing happens.''
|-
!Star
|Ooh.
|-
!Marco
|Come on, Star. What's going on?
|-
!
|''Marco approaches Star, who has a frozen smile.''
|-
!Marco
|Star?! Star! Not you too!
|-
!Star
|Ha-ha! I'm just messin' with ya!
|-
!Marco
|[groans]
|-
!
|''Scene transitions to Diaz Household. Star pulls her [[Magic Instruction Book]] out from under her bed.''
|-
!Star
|Okay, Magic Instruction Book, instruct me.
|-
!
|''Star opens up to a page with [[Glossaryck]], who is also frozen.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, no, Glossaryck is frozen too.
|-
!Marco
|Good. I never liked that guy. [turns a page] "Scrape the sides", buddy.
|-
!Star
|Okay, let's see, let's see. What to do if you make a dimension explode, what to do if you delete gravity... [soft gasp] Ooh.
|-
!Marco
|Don't get any ideas.
|-
!Star
|Heh-heh. Sorry. Ah! What to do if you freeze time. We can move time forward if we go to the [[Plains of Time]] and push the Wheel of Progress.
|-
!
|''Star uses her [[dimensional scissors]] to open a portal to the Plains of Time. Marco steps through the portal.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa.
|-
!
|''The surrounding landscape is covered in sand and melting clocks. There's also an umoving stream of water, a frozen waterfall, a giant hourglass, and a cuckoo clock.''
|-
!Marco
|This is definitely one of the weirder places we've been to.
|-
!Star
|Weirder than that dimension of cats with human faces?
|-
!
|''Flashback to Star and Marco in a different dimension. In front of them is a cat sitting in a litter box with its back turned.''
|-
!Star
|Here, kitty, kitty!
|-
!
|''The cat turns to face Star and Marco. It has a human-like face.''
|-
!Cat
|[demonic voice] Look away!
|-
!
|''Cut back to Plains of Time – present day.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|[shuddering]
|-
!Star
|Look! That must be it.
|-
!
|''Star points to the Wheel of Progress.''
|-
!Star
|Whoooaaa...
|-
!Marco
|Looks like a giant hamster wheel.
|-
!Star
|Now, how do we start this thing?
|-
!Marco
|Hmm. I got this.
|-
!
|''Marco steps onto the Wheel and tries moving it. It doesn't budge.''
|-
!Marco
|[grunting]
|-
!
|''Marco's various attempts to start the Wheel end with him landing on his head and getting his head stuck between two wheel spokes.''
|-
!Star
|New plan. Rainbow Raccoon Rotation!
|-
!
|''Star conjures a Rotating Raccoon. It bounces across and stands next to Star, mimicking her motions.''
|-
!Star
|Hmm.
|-
![[Father Time]]
|Magic won't work on that. You gotta use the magic of toesies. [wiggles toes]
|-
!Star
|Who are you?
|-
!Father Time
|I'm Father Time. And this is Rocksworth. He's a rock, but don't bring it up. He's kind of sensitive about it. [makes motorboat sounds]
|-
!
|''Star helps Marco off the Wheel of Progress.''
|-
!Marco
|Father Time? So you must push this thing. [grunting]
|-
!Father Time
|Hey, look! I'm over here! [moves a little to the left] And now I'm over here! [laughing]
|-
!Star
|And how long were you ''on'' the wheel?
|-
!Father Time
|Oh, you know... forever. Until someone cast a freeze spell and knocked me off of it. What is ''that''? [runs up to a mud puddle]
|-
!Marco
|Uh, mud?
|-
!
|''Father Time falls face-first into the mud and rolls around in it.''
|-
!Father Time
|Oh, it's glorious! I ''love'' mud.
|-
!
|''Father Time slathers mud in his tongue. He gags in disgust and spits the mud in Marco's face.''
|-
!Marco
|So, Mr. Time, how would you feel about getting the universe started up again?
|-
!Father Time
|Oh, where has this been all of my life?
|-
!Star
|Uh... look, look, look.
|-
!
|''Star picks up some mud and slathers it on the Wheel of Progress.''
|-
!Star
|You can play with mud on your wheel.
|-
!Marco
|Huh? Huh?
|-
!Father Time
|Well, that is an enticing offer, but nah.
|-
!Marco
|Argh!
|-
!Father Time
|Oh! There's some mud that's a slightly different color.
|-
!
|''Father Time runs off, and Star and Marco chase after him. He looks at a twig on the ground, a bush with arrows in it, and a goose wearing a clock around its neck.''
|-
!Father Time
|And there's a twig, and there's a bush, and I-I don't know what that thing is, but it's waddling.
|-
!Goose
|[quacking]
|-
!Marco
|Wait! You can't just leave time stopped!
|-
!
|''Father Time starts taking incredibly high jumps across the landscape. Star and Marco can hardly keep up with him.''
|-
!Father Time
|Whoo!
|-
!Star
|But without time, rainbows can't shoot across the sky! Glitter can't glitter!
|-
!Marco
|And everyone we know will be frozen forever!
|-
!
|''Father Time finds a hourglass with a door.''
|-
!Father Time
|What's this?
|-
!
|''The door whooshes open.''
|-
!Father Time
|Ooh!
|-
!
|''Father Time dances through the door, and Star and Marco approach just as the door closes.''
|-
!Father Time
|[o.s., laughing]
|-
!
|''Suddenly, Father Time is racing across the sand on the back of a speedy turtle.''
|-
!Father Time
|YOLO! [laughing] Anything's possible!
|-
!
|''Attempting to give chase, Star and Marco jump on the back of a large rabbit...''
|-
!Marco
|Yah! Whoo-hoo!
|-
!
|''...but the rabbit moves slowly.''
|-
!Marco
|I hate this dimension.
|-
!
|''Elsewhere, Father Time plays in the water.''
|-
!Father Time
|[laughing] Whoo!
|-
!
|''He crosses to the other side of the stream, still laughing.''
|-
!
|''Star and Marco chase after him, using clocks in the stream as stepping stones. They step onto one clock, transforming them into infants. Star helps Marco before he falls into the water. She steps onto the next clock, transforming into an elderly woman. The hearts on her cheeks droop.''
|-
!Star
|[feeble moaning] Oh, my hearts...
|-
!Marco
|[squealing]
|-
!
|''Marco falls over, and his chin lands on the next clock. Only his head is aged up while the rest of his body is still that of an infant.''
|-
!Marco
|Not a word.
|-
!Star
|[giggling]
|-
!
|''Star and Marco reach the other side of the stream, and their bodies are returned to normal. They follow Father Time into a large building filled with television screens.''
|-
!Star
|I think he went in there.
|-
!Marco
|Wow...
|-
!
|''The history of the universe is shown on the screens.''
|-
!Marco
|It's the history of the whole universe! Ooh! Battle of Lexington. Nailed it.
|-
!
|''A giant eyeball extends down from the ceiling and looks at Star. All of the television screens suddenly show Star as a baby.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] It... It's me!
|-
!
|''The screens show baby Star playing with toys, young Star taking the royal carriage for a joyride, and young Star being taught how to swordfight by her [[Royal guard babysitter|babysitter]].''
|-
!Star
|Oh, I remember that!
|-
!
|''The screens also show young Star and [[Pony Head]] stealing treasure from Cyclopes, young Star watching fireworks, and teenage Star and Pony Head going through a punk phase.''
|-
!Star
|[laughing] Watching me is fun.
|-
!
|''The screens also show Star riding the [[Warnicorns|warnicorn]] in "[[Star Comes to Earth]]" before ending on Star's mirror image.''
|-
!Star
|Oh! Hi, me!
|-
!Marco
|This place must keep track of everything we've done in our lives.
|-
!
|''The giant eyeball looks at Marco, and the television screens show his life too. They show him nodding to Jackie Lynn Thomas from kindergarten to elementary school to high school. The camera swivels around Marco as he takes in this realization. The screens then cut to static.''
|-
!Marco
|Wow. I've been nodding for a long time.
|-
!
|''Star puts a comforting hand on Marco's shoulder.''
|-
!Father Time
|(''o.s.'') Hey, guys!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco look at Father Time as he plays with a spring door stopper.''
|-
!Father Time
|Isn't this place incredible? It's like we're living in the future.
|-
!Marco
|Father Time!
|-
!Star
|Emerald Snake Strike!
|-
!
|''Star uses magic to wrap Marco and Father Time in green snakes.''
|-
!Marco
|Great. I think we got him. Yuck. Okay, buddy, let's get you back to your wheel.
|-
!
|''As Marco and Star guide Father Time out of the building, the giant eye looks at him.''
|-
!Father Time
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''The television screens show Father Time running endlessly on the Wheel of Progress, slowly becoming depressed as the years go by. Star and Marco look at each other, sympathetic.''
|-
!Father Time
|Ah, all right. I guess I'll get back to doing that. Oh, well, it's only for all eternity.
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] We can't just make him.
|-
!Star
|Maybe there's some other way to turn that giant wheel.
|-
!
|''Father Time pets a giant hamster. Star and Marco smile.''
|-
!Star
|Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
|-
!
|''Star makes a hamster-drawn carriage for Father Time using the Wheel of Progress as its base.''
|-
!Marco
|Actually, I was thinking we'd— ...Never mind, it works.
|-
!Star
|Now you can go anywhere you want ''and'' keep the wheel moving!
|-
!Father Time
|Aww, thanks, guys. I owe ya. Please help yourself to any of my mud. Even the nice stuff.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco look at Father Time's mud collection. It's a giant mound of mud with several nametags sticking down that read "VOLCANIC", "MOOR MUD", "SLURRY", "BLACK", "MUCK", and "SEA BED".''
|-
!Marco
|We're good.
|-
!Father Time
|Oh, and maybe don't freeze time again. It's kind of fragile. You don't want to break it. Know what I mean? Well, so long! [laughs] Time hamsters away! Yoo-hoo!
|-
!
|''Father Time whips the carriage reins, and the time hamsters pulls the Wheel of Progress forward. Star and Marco smile at each other.''
|-
!Star
|Wait. The wheel's moving.
|-
!Star and Marco
|We've got to get back!
|-
!
|''Back on [[Earth]], a clock moves one minute forward. Mrs. Diaz catches the flipping pancake, the laser puppies start moving again, and Mr. Diaz continues singing opera in the shower. Star and Marco return to the school with the dimensional scissors.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa!
|-
!Star
|Aah!
|-
!
|''Jackie skates past Marco just as he steps out of the portal. He nods to her. She nods back. Marco bites his lip.''
|-
!Marco
|...Hey, Jackie!
|-
!
|''Jackie stops skateboarding and looks back at Marco.''
|-
!Jackie
|Hey, Marco!
|-
!
|''The two briefly look at each other in silence.''
|-
!Jackie
|...Well, see ya!
|-
!
|''Jackie skateboards away, and Marco catches his breath.''
|-
!Star
|You did it! You finally talked to her! What happened to waiting for the perfect time?
|-
!Marco
|Well, all of a sudden, I thought: if you have the time, why waste it? Looks like I'm finally geeeettiiiiing sooooooomewheeeeeeeeeere...
|-
!
|''Time slows to a halt again. Cut back to the Plains of Time, where Father Time and the time hamsters roll in the mud.''
|-
!Father Time
|[laughing] You guys really get me!
