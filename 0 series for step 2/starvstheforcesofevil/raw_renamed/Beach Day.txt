|''Episode begins at the [[Diaz Household]]. A guy wearing sunglasses appears on television.''
|-
!Larry
|That would be a great idea! [lowers sunglasses] If I cared. Ohhh! [sits in inner tube with can of soda]
|-
!
|''Larry's friends - two girls and two guys appear around him.''
|-
!Youths
|[reproachfully] Larry!
|-
!
|''The studio audience laughs and applauds. [[Star Butterfly|Star]] and [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] watch the show on the couch, eating pancakes.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Oh-ho, boy, I am such a Larry.
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Totally!
|-
!
|''On TV, the cast of ''Youths'' are piled up on a blue couch.''
|-
!TV Announcer
|You're watching an all-day marathon of ''Youths''! Get comfy!
|-
!Star and Marco
|Done! [high-five each other]
|-
!Marco
|Oh, man, I missed [[Earth]] TV. Today's gonna be perfect.
|-
!
|''[[Angie Diaz|Angie]] walks in holding a piece of clothing covered in ice.''
|-
![[Angie Diaz]]
|Uh, Star? Is this yours? I found it in the back of the freezer for some reason.
|-
!
|''Star tosses her plate of pancakes up, and it lands on Marco's head.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, my gosh! I was wondering where this went! [takes clothing from Angie and shakes off the ice] Marco, look! My frozen swimsuit!
|-
!Marco
|Cool, cool, cool. [eats piece of pancake]
|-
!Angie
|You know, it might be easier to find next time if you put it in your closet instead of the freezer.
|-
!Star
|[chuckles] Oh, Mrs. Diaz. No, my closet is for secrets, not swimsuits!
|-
!Angie
|[shrugs] Yeah, okay.
|-
!
|''At the living room table, [[Rafael Diaz|Rafael]] takes pictures of [[Mariposa Diaz|Mariposa]] with a slice of quiche in front of her.''
|-
![[Rafael Diaz]]
|Oh, honey, look! It's Mariposa's first breakfast quiche! I've been documenting her cuteness with this trendy instant camera.
|-
!Star
|Instant camera... Wait just a minute. Swimsuit. Instant camera. Unused beach ball that's in the corner! [gasps] Marco!
|-
!Marco
|Aah!
|-
!Star
|I know what we're gonna do today!
|-
!Marco
|Are we... not watching a marathon?
|-
!Star
|Look, all the signs are here! My bathing suit, the instant camera, and the final pièce de résistance!
|-
!
|''Star shows Marco the Beach Day photo.''
|-
!Marco
|Uh... the photo from the future that [[Father Time]] gave you?
|-
!Star
|Don't you see? You have a zit on the tip of your nose!
|-
!
|''Screen super-zooms in on the zit on Marco's nose.''
|-
!Marco
|[covers his zit] So?!
|-
!Star
|Sooo... that zit is exactly the same as the one in the Beach Day photo!
|-
!
|''Screen super-zooms in on the zit on Marco's nose in the photo.''
|-
!Marco
|Ohhhh.
|-
!Star
|Ever since Father Time gave me this future photo, I've been dreaming of the day it would happen. And that day is today!
|-
!Marco
|All right, sure. Maybe it is Beach Day.
|-
!Star
|Oh, you bet your booty it's Beach Day!
|-
!
|''A U.S. flag waves on the TV behind Star, and patriotic music plays in the background.''
|-
!Star
|As soon as my swimsuit is done defrosting, we are going to the beach, and we're gonna have the best day of our lives!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the [[Echo Creek]] highway; Star and Marco are in a taxicab. Marco is looking at his zit in Star's compact mirror, and Star takes his picture with an instant camera.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, boy. Can't wait for this Beach Day!
|-
!Marco
|Yeah. At the rate we're going, we might get there before sunset.
|-
!Star
|Hmm. [to driver] Excuse me. What's, uh... What's taking so long?
|-
!Taxi Driver
|There's a spill up ahead.
|-
!
|''A goatherder is surrounded by goats next to an overturned truck.''
|-
!Goatherder
|Go on, goat. Get back in the truck!
|-
!Goat
|[chomp]
|-
!Goatherder
|Eeh!
|-
!Star
|Oh, no. There's, like, twenty goats out there! We're gonna be here all day!
|-
!Marco
|Star, if I cover up my zit with makeup, would the zit in the photo disappear? Or would I just be unable to conceal it no matter how hard I try? How much of my life would be affected by what I choose to do to my zit? Do I have free will?
|-
!Star
|Marco, you are stressing me out. You know what? I'm just gonna move this along. Super Sparkle Car-Fly Wings!
|-
!
|''Star gives the taxi big purple wings, and it takes off into the sky, flying over the other cars on the highway. One of the goats is chewing on a hubcap. When the taxi flies over, the goat drops the hubcap.''
|-
!Star
|Whoooo!
|-
!Marco
|Flying cars make me sick!
|-
!Star
|But it's totally worth it for Beach Day! How's that for a shortcut, Mr. Driver Man?
|-
!Taxi Driver
|[quietly] Put my car down.
|-
!Star
|What was that?
|-
!Taxi Driver
|I said, put... my car... [glares at Star] DOWN!
|-
!
|''Star looks stunned. She lowers her left arm, and the taxi lands on the ground. Star and Marco get out of the taxi, and it drives off.''
|-
!Marco
|Now what?
|-
!Star
|Don't worry, Marco, I got this. Summoning Sparkle [[Cloudy]] Charm!
|-
!
|''Star summons Cloudy.''
|-
![[Cloudy]]
|Oh, hey there, Star!
|-
!Star
|Cloudy, to the beach!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco climb on top of Cloudy.''
|-
!Marco
|Maybe we should have just done this from the staaaaaart!
|-
!
|''Cloudy takes off into the sky.''
|-
!Cloudy
|Here we goooo! [laughing]
|-
!
|''Cloudy rises up into a dense black smog and descends back to the ground.''
|-
!Cloudy
|[coughing, drops Star and Marco]
|-
!Star
|Augh!
|-
!Marco
|[groans]
|-
!Cloudy
|I can't fly in this! [coughing] It's like breathing death!
|-
!
|''Star sends Cloudy away.''
|-
!Star
|[sighs] Looks like we're walking.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to middle of Echo Creek; a bodybuilder is doing push-ups with his feet on a fire hydrant, and a teenage boy passes by on a skateboard.''
|-
!Bodybuilder
|491, 492, 493, 494...
|-
!
|''Star and Marco walk past the bodybuilder.''
|-
!Marco
|[out of breath] It's weird. It's almost as if events are conspiring against us.
|-
!
|''Star stops walking, and Marco bumps into her.''
|-
!Marco
|[groans]
|-
!Star
|Hey, where is the beach!? The ocean's, like, the biggest thing in this world! How have we not run into it already?!
|-
!
|''A surfer walks past Star and Marco holding a surfboard.''
|-
!Star
|Ah! Surfer dude!
|-
!Surfer
|Huh?
|-
!Star
|Can you tell us how we get to the beach?
|-
!Surfer
|The beach is a state of mind, man. Just follow your heart.
|-
!Star
|That's not helpful, just so you know! Ugh!
|-
!Marco
|Hey, it's all right. Maybe we just need to take a break. Get some food in our belly. [takes out a sandwich]
|-
!Star
|No time for food, Marco! I can't afford any distractions. Beach Day ''is'' going to happen. I can feel it in my bones. We just gotta wait for a sign.
|-
!Marco
|......Are we just gonna stand—?
|-
!
|''A seagull swoops down and snatches the sandwich out of Marco's hand.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah!
|-
!Star
|The sign! C'mon, Marco! Follow that seagull! [pulls Marco by the arm]
|-
!Marco
|Aah!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco follow the seagull across town.''
|-
!Seagull
|[screeching]
|-
!Star and Marco]
|[panting]
|-
!
|''Star and Marco eventually arrive at the beach and stare out at the ocean.''
|-
!Star
|We made it. Beach Day is actually happening!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco run down to the beach.''
|-
!Star
|Aah! Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! The water is perfect. The sand is perfect. Everything is perfect! Now all we gotta do is take that picture! [takes out box of crackers] Oh. [laughs] Oh, this is a box of crackers. [reaches into her bag] Where's the real camera? [drops bunch of stuff on the sand] Where is the camera?! [shakes her bag upside-down, gasps] Oh, no! I must have left it in the cab! I left the camera in the caaaab! [puts her face in the sand]
|-
!Marco
|Hey, it's okay.
|-
!Star
|Oh, no. The photo's gone, too.
|-
!Marco
|Oh.
|-
!Star
|I just don't understand. Today was supposed to be Beach Day! I can't believe I lost the photo ''and'' the camera!
|-
!Marco
|Hey, look at it this way. It's a beautiful day. We can still have a fun day at the beach.
|-
!Star
|[crosses her arms] Myehh.
|-
!Marco
|I'll let you make me into a sand mermaid.
|-
!Star
|[smiles]
|-
!
|''Star and Marco run around the beach with a beach ball, laughing and whooping. They hit the beach ball back and forth. Star uses a Rainbow Fist to hit the ball high into the air.''
|-
!Marco
|I got it! I—!
|-
!
|''Marco gets engulfed by the water. When it washes away, Marco has a bunch of seaweed on his head. He catches the beach ball.''
|-
!Marco
|Got it.
|-
!Star
|You know what you look like?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Star and Marco making Marco look like a sand mermaid; he has a starfish and seashell on his chest to resemble a bra, and his legs are covered in sand shaped like a mermaid tail.''
|-
!Star
|You know, this day actually turned out pretty good after all.
|-
!
|''An old lady taps on Star's shoulder. She has a camera hanging around her neck.''
|-
!Old Lady
|Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you. It's just that... Oh, you two looked so cute earlier, and I just happened to see this adorable young couple.
|-
!Star
|We're not a couple. [gasps, sees old lady's camera]
|-
!Old Lady
|I debated whether or not to even say anything, but when opportunity comes along like this...
|-
!Star
|Ohhhh! [gasps]
|-
!Old Lady
|[holding a photograph] ...well, you just have to take the bull by the horns. [laughs]
|-
!
|''Star takes the old lady's photograph away.''
|-
!Old Lady
|Oh.
|-
!Star
|[looks at photograph] Whaaa...?
|-
!Marco
|[looks at photograph] No. Way.
|-
!
|''When the photograph comes into focus, it shows Star and Marco holding a beach ball.''
|-
!Star
|It's the Beach Day photo!
|-
!Marco
|How... How? How?!
|-
!Star
|It's all part of the paradox! We lost the camera ''and'' the photo earlier today because I was supposed to, because this creepy lady was meant to take our Beach Day photo!
|-
!Marco
|So that means...
|-
!Star and Marco
|Today ''is'' Beach Day!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco dance happily.''
|-
!Star
|It is Beach Day! It is Beach Day! I lived the happiest day of my life!
|-
!Marco
|Woo-hoo! [laughs] Yeah! Wow! Wow! This is bananas! The paradox came true! It was real! Everything happened for a reason!
|-
!
|''As Star stares at the photo, she stops dancing and looks sad. She takes out Marco's [[dimensional scissors]], opens a [[dimensional portal]], and steps through it.''
|-
!Marco
|Wow! Oh, my goodness! It's so exciting! [notices Star is gone] Star?
|-
!
|''Star enters the [[Plains of Time]]. Father Time is seen playing in the stream with his time hamsters.''
|-
![[Father Time]]
|[laughing and humming]
|-
!Star
|Hey, Father Time? [shows Father Time the photo] Why am I not happy?
|-
!Father Time
|Oh, hey. It's that beach photo. You look pretty happy to me.
|-
!Star
|No, I ''was'' happy. But that was, like, five minutes ago, and it's already starting to wear off. I thought Beach Day was supposed to be the best day of my life, and everything would be figured out, and then I could just live happily ever after or whatever. But that didn't happen. So why'd you even give this to me?
|-
!Father Time
|I didn't give that to you.
|-
!Star
|Uh, yes, you did.
|-
!Father Time
|No, no, no. ''You'' did.
|-
!Star
|What?
|-
!Father Time
|Yeah, you gave me the photo to give to Past Star, because you knew she was about to go through a lot of difficult, messy life stuff. You know, what with her mom going missing and her identity as a princess kind of thrown out the window. You wanted to give her something to look forward to.
|-
!Star
|''I'' gave this to me? But that can't... T-That means this whole time Beach Day was a lie? A lie I told myself?!
|-
!Father Time
|I can just destroy it for you, seeing as it's giving you so much grief.
|-
!Star
|You know what? Yeah, sure. Beach Day, no Beach Day — what's the difference? So what if I don't see it up on the fridge every day... or keep it in my little purse always... or... stuff it under my pillow every night?
|-
!Father Time
|Yeah, who needs it? No photo, no Beach Day, no confusing time paradox. You wouldn't even be here right now asking about it. Who knows where you'd be?
|-
!Star
|That's a... That's a good question. Some days, knowing I'd be this happy was the only thing that kept me going.
|-
!Father Time
|So you want me to destroy it?
|-
!Star
|No. No! No, no, no! You can't! I needed this! You gotta give it to Past Star! Wait, no! I don't want to give it away. But if I keep it, I'll never have given it to myself, so I'll never have had it, and then it'll never have existed at all. [gasps] Whoa! Okay, okay, you know what?
|-
!
|''Star takes a picture of the photograph with her compact phone.''
|-
!Star
|There. Now she can have it.
|-
!
|''Star levitates the photo over to Father Time and opens a portal back to Earth.''
|-
!Star
|Bye, Father Time. Thank you so much.
|-
!Father Time
|Sure thing! Too bad the hardest times are still ahead.
|-
!Star
|[sticks her head back through the portal] What was that?
|-
!Father Time
|Nothing!
|-
!
|''Star leaves, and the portal closes. Father Time takes out a pen and writes "BEACH DAY!" and draws a little yellow sun on the photo.''
|-
!Father Time
|[hums] "B-E-A-C-H"... "Beach Day!"
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to the Echo Creek beach at sunset. Star watches the sunset, and Marco makes a sand sculpture of [[Ludo]].''
|-
!Star
|So basically, Beach Day was never real. I was chasing some perfect idea that didn't even exist. Don't get me wrong. It got me though a lot. But... now how am I supposed to know if everything will end up okay?
|-
!Marco
|Well, I guess we just don't.
|-
!Star
|Huh?
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, I mean... you don't know what'll happen in the future, but who does? It wasn't the Beach Day itself that made you happy, right? It... It was... It was you.
|-
!Star
|Huh.
|-
!Marco
|You didn't wait for someone to tell you everything would be okay. You created your own happiness through self-determination! Anyway, I thought that was pretty cool.
|-
!Star
|Yeah. Maybe you're right.
|-
!Marco
|[smushes sand sculpture of Ludo] Well, I'm kinda Beach Day'd out. [chuckles] What do you say we head home?
|-
!Star
|I say let's do it.
|-
!Marco
|Wait! We don't have a way to get home!
|-
!Star
|Actually...
|-
!
|''Star levitates a shopping cart partially buried in the sand.''
|-
!Star
|Ah? Ahh?
|-
!Marco
|Star, I'm not wheeling you all the way home in a shopping cart.
|-
!Star
|[chuckles] Not wheeling, silly.
|-
!
|''Cut to Star and Marco riding a shopping cart with wings through the sky.''
|-
!Star
|Woo-hoo-hoo! Woo-hoo!
|-
!Marco
|Aaaah! No, no, no!
|-
!Star
|[laughs] Woo-hoo!
|-
!Marco
|I'm gonna be sick! But it's worth it for Beach Day!
|-
!Star
|Beach Daaaaay!
