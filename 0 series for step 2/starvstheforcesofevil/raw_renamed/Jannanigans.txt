|''Episode begins at the [[Diaz Household]]. [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] is sleeping in bed.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|[snoring]
|-
!
|''[[Star Butterfly|Star]] slowly pulls Marco toward the foot of the bed and onto the floor.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|[whispering] Marco. Wake up.
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] No.
|-
!Star
|[whispering] I know the solution to getting back to [[Mewni]]. It's [[Janna Ordonia|Janna]]!
|-
!Marco
|Janna? [groans] Let's not talk about Janna until I've had my morning tea.
|-
!
|''Star pulls hard on Marco's legs so his head hits the floor.''
|-
!Marco
|Ugh! Oww!
|-
!Star
|Don't you remember? [sits on top of Marco]
|-
!Marco
|[groans]
|-
!Star
|Janna mysteriously showed up on Mewni without a portal.
|-
!Marco
|Ohhh, yeah. We gotta wake up [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]]. Tom, wake up!
|-
!
|''Tom's bed is empty.''
|-
!Marco
|Tom?
|-
!Star
|Ugh. Look up.
|-
!
|''Tom is seen sleeping with his body floating in mid-air.''
|-
!Marco
|Ugh!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Star calling Janna on her mirror phone.''
|-
!Mirror Phone
|Calling Janna.
|-
!Star
|C'mon, Janna, pick up your phone. Pick up, pick up, pick up...
|-
!Marco
|Uh, she'll never pick up. She's probably someplace super weird.
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|Like a monster truck graveyard.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah!
|-
!Tom
|Yeah.
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
|Hello?
|-
!Star
|Oh, thank goodness, Janna! Okay! Okay, listen to me very carefully. We are stuck on Earth. The portals aren't working. You gotta tell me - how did you get to Mewni?
|-
!Tom
|[grabs Star's phone] Yeah! We gotta get back, like, now!
|-
!Marco
|Something really bad is happening!
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]'s Voice
|Wait, can you say that louder?
|-
!
|''Janna is shown to be at a monster truck graveyard.''
|-
!Janna
|[grunting] Yeah, the reception here is pretty bad. I'm at a monster truck graveyard.
|-
!
|''Marco and Tom high-five.''
|-
!Star
|Listen to me carefully. [deep breath] How... did... you... get... to... Mewni?
|-
!Janna
|I don't know. Bye. [hangs up]
|-
!Star
|No, no, Janna, wait! Ugh! Arrrgh! Janna!
|-
!Tom
|Now what?
|-
!Marco
|We gotta wait for the beast in her cave.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Janna's house. Star, Tom, and Marco are sitting across from Janna's parents and holding cups of tea.''
|-
!Janna's Dad
|It's so nice to finally meet our Janna's friends. And each as unique as her, it seems. So, did you meet before the Canada trip?
|-
!Tom
|What's a Canada?
|-
!Janna's Dad
|Oh! Did I pronounce it wrong? Tala and I have never been, so, you know. Janna says it's lovely.
|-
!Marco
|[sips tea]
|-
!Star
|[sips tea]
|-
!Tom
|[sips tea]
|-
!Tala Ordonia
|Are any of you dating?
|-
!Tom
|[chokes, coughs]
|-
!
|''Janna enters the house and starts heading upstairs.''
|-
!Janna
|Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
|-
!Tala
|Hi, sweetie!
|-
!Star, Marco, and Tom
|Janna!
|-
!Janna
|Oh, geez. [continues walking upstairs]
|-
!Marco
|N-Nice... Nice meeting you, Mr. and Mrs. Janna!
|-
!
|''Star, Tom, and Marco follow Janna upstairs.''
|-
!Tala
|I hear Vancouver's nice.
|-
!
|''Star, Tom, and Marco burst into Janna's bedroom.''
|-
!Star, Marco, and Tom
|Janna!
|-
!
|''Janna dumps a bunch of junk out of her duffel bag and onto her bed.''
|-
!Janna
|I thought you kids respected others' personal space. Welcome to my room, I guess.
|-
!
|''Tom walks up to a giant animate eyeball in the corner.''
|-
!Tom
|Wow, sweet digs.
|-
!
|''The eyeball blinks at Tom. Marco finds a long horned bug in a glass tank.''
|-
!Marco
|It's nicely creepy.
|-
!Janna
|Soooo... how's the breakup going?
|-
!Star
|What?! That JUST happened! How did you even know that?!
|-
!Janna
|Oh, I hid a camera on Marco's body.
|-
!Marco
|What?! Tom! Help me find this illegal surveillance!
|-
!Tom
|[pushes Marco away] No, no! Dude, I don't wanna get bugged!
|-
!Star
|Guys! We can't get distracted by her... "Jannanigans".
|-
!
|''Janna smiles at the others while using a screwdriver.''
|-
!Star
|Janna Banana, you know the seriousness of this situation. And you know you're our last hope. So, please, how did you get to Mewni?
|-
!Janna
|I don't remember.
|-
!Marco
|Aaahhhhhh!
|-
!Janna
|No, really. Look, all I remember from that day is that it was a Thursday. A totally normal Thursday.
|-
!Star
|All right. I'm scared to ask, but what is a "normal" Thursday like for Janna?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to outside a garage next door to Janna's house. Janna is holding a bag of garbage.''
|-
!Janna
|Thursday is garbage day.
|-
!Tom
|So you bring your garbage to your neighbor's garage?
|-
!Janna
|To feed the possums.
|-
!
|''Janna opens the garage, and a bunch of possums jump out and attack Marco and Tom.''
|-
!Marco and Tom
|[screaming]
|-
!Tom
|You're not supposed to feed these things!
|-
!Janna
|If I don't, they'll come to ''my'' garage.
|-
!
|''Janna dumps the garbage near the possums.''
|-
!Tom
|No! No! That's my leg!
|-
!Star
|So what happened next?
|-
!Janna
|Well, usually these rascals tear up my hat...
|-
!
|''Janna holds out her hat in front of possums, and they rip it up off-screen.''
|-
!Janna
|...and then I have to go get a new one from Needles.
|-
!Star
|Who's Needles?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to an alleyway in the city with graffiti all over the walls.''
|-
!Janna
|He's the man who runs these streets.
|-
!
|''The alleyway is occupied by gang members wearing colorful knitted clothes. One of them - Pickles - confronts the group.''
|-
!Pickles
|Whoa, whoa, Janna! You know the boss isn't happy with you.
|-
!Janna
|[holds out her hand] He who gives shall never need.
|-
!Pickles
|[holds out his hand] He who takes shall forever bleed. [slaps Janna's hand] It ain't my fault if you leave here in crutches.
|-
!
|''Pickles leads Janna down the alley.''
|-
!Janna
|[to Star, Tom, and Marco] Come on.
|-
!
|''Star, Tom, and Marco follow Janna.''
|-
!Marco
|I don't like the sound of this Needles.
|-
!Pickles
|Hey! Quiet in the back!
|-
!Janna
|Show some respect.
|-
!
|''Pickles and Janna walk behind a knitted curtain. Needles, the gang leader with a glass eye and knitting needles in his hair, is seen knitting a scarf.''
|-
!Needles
|Janna! What's up?
|-
!Janna
|Hey, Needles.
|-
!Needles
|Looks like you need a new hat.
|-
!Janna
|Looks right.
|-
!Needles
|But you still owe me for the last one I made you. Don't forget, you're in the red.
|-
!
|''Janna puts on her new hat.''
|-
!Janna
|Oh, dang. I never got you the goods.
|-
!Needles
|Yeah, that's right! And you know what that means! Omega One doesn't have any tennis balls!
|-
!
|''Needles holds up his puppy, Omega One.''
|-
!Star
|Tennis balls?
|-
!Janna
|Yeah. Needles knits my hats that I pay for with tennis balls. Standard back alley deal.
|-
!Pickles
|[knitting dollar bills] Yeah, standard back alley deal! You know what it is. A normal thing. That's how we do it.
|-
!Star
|We don't have time for this! We gotta get to Mewni!
|-
!Needles
|Well, guess what? You better ''make'' some time. Or Bland Man over here is gonna get broke like a breadstick! Crack!
|-
!Marco
|What? Who? Me?
|-
!Needles
|Or maybe we can make a deal for these sweet horns! [points at Tom's horns] I could make a real nice hat with those. Hand 'em over!
|-
!Star
|Hey! [pushes Needles' arm away]
|-
!Janna
|Cool it, Needles. My crew and I will get you the goods.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to behind a public tennis court. Star, Tom, Marco, and Janna are picking up lost tennis balls.''
|-
!Janna
|Oooh, that's a fresh one. Just about a hundred more to go!
|-
!Tom
|Man. A week ago, I was staring at a thousand sunsets in the Dimension with a Thousand Sunsets. And now I'm here picking up tennis balls.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, sorry it ended like this.
|-
!Tom
|It's cool. And you know what? [puts hand on Marco's shoulder] ''We're'' cool.
|-
!Marco
|Wait, were we not?
|-
!Tom
|Well, with Star and I broken up now, just saying it's cool if...
|-
!Marco
|If what?
|-
!Tom
|I mean, if you and your best friend... [points at Star] ...ended up being something else, I wouldn't be mad.
|-
!Marco
|What? Tom, the Blood Moon Curse has been lifted. I mean, you were there.
|-
!Tom
|Come on, dude. I think we both know that what you two have is something better than a curse.
|-
!
|''Star suddenly pops in.''
|-
!Star
|Guys!
|-
!Marco
|Aah! [drops tennis balls on the ground]
|-
!Star
|I think we gotta-- What are you staring at?
|-
!Marco
|Uh... [mumbles gibberish]
|-
!Star
|I think we gotta put some pressure on her. This is getting ridiculous. Janna! How can you not be taking this seriously?!
|-
!Tom
|Mewni might be in trouble!
|-
!Marco
|You're wasting so much time!
|-
!Janna
|Well, excuse me, Bland Man! Geez! [walks away]
|-
!Marco
|Hey! That's not my name!
|-
!Janna
|What part of "I don't remember how I got to Mewni" do you guys not understand?! You guys just do not get it! I am the author of my own weirdness! But forgetting how I got to Mewni was totally out of my control, and it freaks me out! [sighs]
|-
!Star
|Aw, Janna...
|-
!Janna
|I'm sorry I can't help you guys out. I really am. I just cannot remember what happened that day for the life of me.
|-
!Marco
|Janna, I'm... I didn't realize how much all of this was affecting you. Plus, I didn't realize that you actually had human emotions.
|-
!Janna
|Yeah. Me, neither.
|-
!Marco
|C'mon. Let's... Let's just take a break.
|-
!Janna
|Well, collecting tennis balls does make me hungry.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to [[Britta's Tacos]]. Star, Tom, Marco, and Janna are sitting at an outdoor table looking depressed. [[Oskar Greason]] appears with a tray of food.''
|-
![[Oskar Greason]]
|Okay, party people, I got your grub. Taco-o-o-o for Mango-o-o-o. [laughs] All right. And for the lady... Wait a second! Your name wouldn't happen to be Janna, would it?
|-
!Janna
|No. It's Banana.
|-
!Oskar
|[looks skeptical] ...Okay, cool. [gives Janna a burrito] All I know is I'm supposed to refuse service to someone named Janna.
|-
!Tom
|Can't be too careful!
|-
!Oskar
|I know, right? Dangerous world. But, as they say, "Enjoy your horchata." [gives Star a cup of horchata]
|-
!Star
|[sips horchata]
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, Tom, and Janna spend several seconds in silence eating their food.''
|-
!Tom
|So you just havin' horchata today, huh, Star?
|-
!Star
|I'm just too stressed to eat right now. I mean, we have no idea what's happening on Mewni.
|-
!
|''Tom puts a lot of hot sauce on his taco.''
|-
!Star
|Why do you have to put hot sauce on every bite? Why don't you just put it on the whole taco all at once?
|-
!Tom
|[pauses, looks annoyed]
|-
!Janna
|Whew! Habanero sauce makes me sweat like a beast! [removes her jacket]
|-
!Marco
|Pfft! Hey! That's my shirt!
|-
!Janna
|What are you talking about?
|-
!Marco
|This is the [[Britta's Tacos (episode)|200-taco punch card Mystery Prize]]! And it's mine! Just look at it!
|-
!
|''The back of Janna's shirt has the Britta's Tacos logo on it.''
|-
!Marco
|See?!
|-
!Janna
|[gasps] Guys! I remember!
|-
!Marco
|You remember stealing my shirt?!
|-
!Tom
|No! Shh-shh-shh! Marco! You'll break her train of thought!
|-
!Janna
|After I collected the tennis balls, I stopped by here on my way back to Needles and saw a promo for the 200-taco Mystery Prize. And I figured, "Hey, this girl has eaten at least 200 tacos over the course of her lifetime," so they already owed me the prize. But they didn't see it that way. So I claimed what was mine. I went to the back door and...
|-
!
|''Janna throws her weight against the back entrance of Britta's Tacos.''
|-
!Janna
|Omph! Omph! Omph!
|-
!
|''[[Sensei Brantley]] opens the door.''
|-
![[Sensei Brantley]]
|Hello?
|-
!
|''Janna throws her weight again, hitting Brantley to the floor. Janna picks herself up and dusts herself off.''
|-
!Janna
|Okay. At Britta's, they always keep the Mystery Prize in the supply closet, so I forced open the door.
|-
!
|''There are dents in the supply closet door.''
|-
!Janna
|Yup! Sure enough! Forced entry! [opens closet door] And this is where it gets weird!
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, Tom, and Janna descend into a sub-level under Britta's Tacos on top of [[Cloudy]]. Star is using Glowworm Blast to illuminate the dark. Marco and Tom are plugging their noses from the smell.''
|-
!Janna
|I went down this creepy ladder.
|-
!Marco and Tom
|[groan]
|-
!Janna
|Yeah, I think they age their meat down here.
|-
!
|''The group enters a large open-air tunnel underground. There are dinosaur bones in the walls and tennis balls strewn across the ground.''
|-
!Janna
|Oh, yeah, this is looking familiar.
|-
!Marco
|Are those dinosaur bones?
|-
!Tom
|Man, this place is downright homey! [jumps off of Cloudy and slips on tennis balls] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Oof!
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!Star and Janna
|Tennis balls!
|-
!
|''Janna finds a wire hanger.''
|-
!Janna
|Ah, and here it is! Where I got my new shirt! And then I guess I saw this dumb wall with graffiti.
|-
!
|''Janna points to hieroglyphics on a stone wall depicting [[Glossaryck]], human worshippers, boats sailing on gold water, and [[warnicorns]].
|-
!Marco
|Whoooaaaa! I don't think that's graffiti.
|-
!Star
|Glossaryck? Janna, what happened next?
|-
!
|''Janna finds a rock where she wrote "JANNA WAS HERE" in red but left one "E" off of "HERE". She takes out red lipstick and adds the missing "E".''
|-
!Janna
|[chuckles] I guess I was here. Aaah!
|-
!
|''She falls into a well.''
|-
!Star, Marco, and Tom
|Aah!
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, and Tom run over to the well. Tom pulls off the well cover, and Star and Marco pull Janna out. She is covered in gold water.''
|-
!Star
|Are you okay?
|-
!Janna
|Yeah. I just, uh... fell into some secret sauce.
|-
!Tom
|[dips his hand into water] Uh, I don't think that's secret sauce.
|-
!
|''Star has a look of realization on her face. She looks at the well cover. The underside has two black handprints on it.
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Flashback to "[[Conquer]]". Star and her mother [[Moon Butterfly|Moon]] emerge from the [[Realm of Magic]] into a world blocked off by a wooden sewer grate, which they hit their heads on.
|-
!Star and [[Moon Butterfly]]
|Oof!
|-
!Star
|Hey!
|-
!Moon
|Let's see what's up there.
|-
!
|''Moon pushes against the grate cover with her hands, but it's stuck, and she leaves behind two black handprints. Scene flashes back to present day.''
|-
!Star
|You guys, I've seen these before! This is a well... that leads to the magic.
|-
!Janna
|[gasps] Now I remember!
