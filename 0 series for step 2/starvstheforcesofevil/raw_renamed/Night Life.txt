| ''A dragon cycle roars by in the distance. On it rides grown-up [[Marco Diaz]] and [[Hekapoo]].''
|-
!Marco
| Hold on to my abs. They'll keep you safe.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Hey, Mr. Muscles. Just keep driving.
|-
!Marco
| Just lookin' out for your safety.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Well, then look out for that cliff!
|-
!Marco
| Huh?
|-
!
| ''They scream as Marco drives off a cliff. The dragon cycle's wings flap right before they hit the bottom.''
|-
!Marco
| Ha-ha! Oh, man, I was not payin' attention. Nice save, Nachos.
|-
!
| ''The cycle rolls an entire 360 degrees.''
|-
!Hekapoo
| Marco!
|-
!Marco
| Sorry. So, uh, what are we lookin' for again?
|-
!Hekapoo
| Oh, uh, [points] that thing.
|-
!
| ''A giant one-eyed squid is floating immediately to their right.''
|-
!Marco
| Follow me. [punches squid's eye]
|-
!
| ''The squid starts chasing them aggressively. Both scream.''
|-
!Hekapoo
| Why did you punch it in the eye?
|-
!Marco
| Where else was I supposed to punch it?
|-
!Hekapoo
| Just don't punch it!
|-
!
| ''The two fly right towards a portal, but then swerve straight downwards. The squid, not reacting quickly enough, flies through the portal. Hekapoo leaps up to the portal and closes it with her [[dimensional scissors]].''
|-
!Marco
| Whoa!
|-
!Hekapoo
| Just drive, muscles.
|-
!Marco
| Yes, ma'am.
|-
!
| ''The scene changes to a tavern with the name "Dragon Spit". Hekapoo and no-longer-grown-up Marco are inside getting drinks.''
|-
!Hekapoo
| Another portal closed.
|-
!
| ''They toast.''
|-
!Marco
| Man, I miss this. Punchin' monsters, crazy adventures, seeing weird things.
|-
![[Quirky Guy]]
| Hey! Who you callin' weird? I'm quirky.
|-
!Marco
| I just wish more portals would open in your dimension, Hekapoo. [flexes] I look so awesome there.
|-
!Hekapoo
| [dryly] Yeah, it's a real shame.
|-
!Marco
| [watch beeps] Oh, I gotta go.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Already? We just sat down.
|-
!Quirky Guy
| I'll sit with ya.
|-
!Hekapoo
| [gets up] No, thanks, weirdo.
|-
!
| ''Outside the bar.''
|-
!Marco
| [to dragon cycle] Nachos! Oh, buddy, it's getting harder and harder to leave ya.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Hey, muscles, you comin' back tomorrow?
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, if you need me.
|-
!Hekapoo
| I could use a hand.
|-
!Marco
| Cool. Can't wait.
|-
!
| ''Marco opens a portal and steps through. He arrives in [[Star Butterfly]]'s room during night, and tries not to wake up Star. Star, however, was awake in bed as he arrived. She has a black eye and looks quite beat up.''
|-
!Star
| Marco?
|-
!Marco
| Hey... oh... whaâ€“what happened to your face?
|-
!Star
| I tried to take [[Glossaryck]] for a walk today. It did not go well.
|-
!
| ''Glossaryck scratches his ear with his foot.''
|-
!Star
| I really could've used some help from my squire, who was mysteriously not around.
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, sorry. I was, uh... fishing.
|-
!Star
| You went fishing in the middle of the night?
|-
!Marco
| Yep.
|-
!Star
| Well, did you catch anything?
|-
!Marco
| [sweating] I caught a mackerel. A big old mackerel.
|-
!Star
| You caught a mackerel? Well, where is it?
|-
!Marco
| [silence] I ate it.
|-
!Star
| Okay... Well, I gotta help my dad clear out the castle sewers tomorrow. Fuuuuun! So can you just keep an eye on Glossaryck?
|-
!Marco
| Yeah. I can do that.
|-
!Star
| Oh, great. Things have been pretty busy around here.
|-
!Marco
| Well, your squire is here to help.
|-
!Star
| Thanks, squire.
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps to the Dimension of Cats with Human Faces. Water is flooding in from a portal.''
|-
!Cat 1
| [screeches]
|-
!Cat 2
| Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!
|-
!Cat 3
| This is a meow-trage, I say. [to Hekapoo] Can you hurry up?
|-
!Hekapoo
| [struggling to close the portal] I'm trying!
|-
!
| ''The flooding water knocks her away from the portal, and Hekapoo screams. A pirate ship comes sailing through.''
|-
!Seabunny Captain
| Shiver me timbers, we're all gonna die...!
|-
!
| ''The seabunnies scream as their boat starts falling. Hekapoo makes a new portal, appears above the original one, and uses a grappling hook to try to hoist the ship back in. Marco arrives riding his dragon cycle.''
|-
!Marco
| Hekapoo! Hey! I'm here!
|-
!Hekapoo
| Oh. It's nice of you to show up.
|-
!Marco
| Star needed me to watch Glossaryck. But-but it's cool, I handled it.
|-
!Hekapoo
| [struggling] Great story. Now can you give me a hand with this?
|-
!Marco
| Oh, right.
|-
!
| ''Marco flies up on his cycle towards the ship.''
|-
!Seabunnies
| Huh?
|-
!
| ''The other pirates scream as Nachos smacks his tale, knocking the ship through the portal. The portal then closes.''
|-
!Seabunny
| Captain, what were those strange creatures?
|-
!Seabunny Captain
| Angels, me boy. They be but angels.
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps back to the cat dimension.''
|-
!Cat 4
| Fur-tastic.
|-
!Cat 5
| You two make a purr-fect team.
|-
!Cat 3
| Meow-velous.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Well, I hate it here. So... tavern?
|-
!
| ''Marco's watch beeps.''
|-
!Marco
| Oh, no. I gotta go. Star needs me. She says it's urgent. But the same time tomorrow?
|-
!Hekapoo
| Ah, you bet. [smacks Marco's head with flaming hand]
|-
!Marco
| Ugh. Please stop doing that.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Not until you're bald.
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps to Star's room as Marco portals in.''
|-
!Marco
| Hey, Star, what's the emer... gen... cy?
|-
!
| ''Star's entire bedroom is in shambles. Star looks very angry.''
|-
!Star
| You had one job.
|-
!Marco
| Sorry, I was uh.. [puts scissors behind back] fishing again.
|-
!Star
| Wait a minute. Greasy pants. Dimensional scissors. [gasps] Scorched bald spot! You haven't been fishing at all! You've been hanging out with Hekapoo again!
|-
!Marco
| Uh, uh, just, just for, like, a second.
|-
!Star
| [groans] Marco, I need you here. Glossaryck needs constant surveillance.
|-
!Glossaryck
| [blows raspberry]
|-
!Star
| I know it's not as glamourous as dragon cycling. I've been really overwhelmed lately, and I need your help.
|-
!Marco
| [sighs] You're right. No more moonlighting. Here. [hands Star his scissors] You can watch these for me.
|-
!Star
| [sighs] Thanks, Marco.
|-
!Marco
| I'm at your service, milady.
|-
!Star
| Ha-ha-ha. Don't ever call me that. Now get some sleep, you. Tomorrow, we're gonna be waist-deep in sewer sludge.
|-
!Marco
| Can't wait.
|-
!
| ''Scene changes to night. Marco is in bed, but not sleeping.''
|-
!Marco
| Let's ride.
|-
!
| ''He sneaks into Star's room and grabs his scissors.''
|-
!Marco
| Okay, this is just for tonight. [opens portal]
|-
!Glossaryck
| [blows raspberry]
|-
!Marco
| Don't look at me like that.
|-
!
| ''Marco steps though the portal. Scene changes to Hekapoo, who is in a tavern with a map.''
|-
!Marco
| Hey, sorry. I'm late again, uh. Where are we riding today?
|-
!Hekapoo
| Well, this next job's pretty big, so I hired [[Talon Raventalon]] for some extra muscle.
|-
!Marco
| Who's Talon Raventalon?
|-
![[Talon Raventalon]]
| (''o.s.'') I'm Talon Raventalon!
|-
!
| ''Electric guitar riff plays as the camera shows a bald eagle humanoid with huge muscles. He takes off his sunglasses.''
|-
!Talon
| [to bartender] One glass of worms! Extra wiggly!
|-
!Marco
| Hekapoo, we don't need this bro.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Actually, we kinda do. You've been so busy, I wasn't sure you were gonna show, and I can't do this job alone.
|-
!Marco
| I guess that's fair... But him?
|-
!
| ''Talon Raventalon's beak is stuffed full of worms.''
|-
!Marco
| So what's the job, anyway?
|-
!Talon
| Dragon cyclers don't ask questions. Dragon cyclers ride! [puts on sunglasses]
|-
!Marco
| Ugh.
|-
!Hekapoo
| [opens portal] Follow us, okay?
|-
!Talon
| Yaaar!
|-
!
| ''They all head off to a new dimension on their dragon cycles: Hekapoo and Talon are on one, Marco on the other.''
|-
!Marco
| So what are we doing today?
|-
!Hekapoo
| Something fun.
|-
!Marco
| Ooh, like what?
|-
!Hekapoo
| Like closing up these portals for good.
|-
!
| ''They land their cycles.''
|-
!Marco
| Wait, so... what?
|-
!Hekapoo
| [looking at map] There's a pattern to where these portals have been opening. And the next one should open right over there. Whatever comes out of it, we're takin' it down!
|-
!Talon
| Oh, yeah! With this!
|-
!
| ''He takes a cloth off of a harpoon gun.''
|-
!Marco
| Doesn't this seem like overkill?
|-
!Talon
| Talon likes overkill!
|-
!Marco
| H-Poo, can we chat?
|-
!
| ''The two walk away from Talon.''
|-
!Marco
| So it's just that closing these portals with you has been the highlight of my time on Mewni. Do we really have to stop?
|-
!Hekapoo
| Marco, this has been fun, but I've got a job to do.
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, just don't do it.
|-
!Hekapoo
| My job is to stop whatever comes out of that portal.
|-
!
| ''She points off in the distance. A portal stars opening right where she pointed.''
|-
!Talon
| Incoming!
|-
!
| ''A yellow fireball flies out of the portal.''
|-
!Hekapoo
| There it is!
|-
!Talon
| Oh, yeah! [aims harpoon gun]
|-
!Marco
| Stop! [kicks over Talon]
|-
!Hekapoo
| Marco, what are you doing?!
|-
!Marco
| I'm not sure, but you need to stop!
|-
!Talon
| [threatening] Ooh... Oh, I'm just gettin' started. [his glasses shatter, kiais] Ba-kaw!
|-
!
| ''The two start fighting each other.''
|-
!Hekapoo
| Marco, it's my job. [aims harpoon gun]
|-
!
| ''In the harpoon gun's scope, Hekapoo see's that the yellow fireball is actually Star in her Mewberty form. Hekapoo's eye widens and she starts sweating.''
|-
!Hekapoo
| [gasps] Star?
|-
!Talon
| [shoving Hekapoo aside] Oh, I love harpoons!
|-
!Hekapoo
| No! You idiot!
|-
!
| ''Talon fires the harpoon.''
|-
!Talon
| Ha-ha!
|-
!
| ''Hekapoo jumps on the dragon cycle with the gun, and pulls it the opposite direction. Marco jumps onto Talon. As Hekapoo rides, the rope on the harpoon pulls taut and can no longer unwind any further.''
|-
!Marco
| Star!
|-
!
| ''The harpoon stops, mere inches away from her eye. Hekapoo sighs as she stops the cycle. Star opens a portal and flies through it.''
|-
!Marco
| That was some great riding, Hekapoo.
|-
!Hekapoo
| [yelling] You knew?! You knew that Star was the one opening these portals, and you didn't tell me?!
|-
!Marco
| Okay, okay, hear me out.
|-
!Hekapoo
| I'm reporting this to the High Commission. [walks away]
|-
!Marco
| Okay, yeah, I lied to you about Star, but not about anything else. Working with you has been incredible, and I don't want it to end. Please don't report this to the High Commission. Star needs to figure out her new powers on her own.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?
|-
!Marco
| I'm her squire. I can make sure she's safe. Haven't I earned your trust by now?
|-
!Hekapoo
| [aflame] No!!
|-
!Marco
| [sighs, in adult voice] Pretty please, H-Poo?
|-
!Hekapoo
| [whimpers, angrily] Oh, you know I can't resist your adult voice. Fine. I won't report this for your sake, but us working together is oâ€“ver.
|-
!Marco
| Hekapoo.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Here. [tosses him the map] You're gonna need this. Star's lucky to have a squire like you. [to dragon cycle] Hyah!
|-
!
| ''Hekapoo rides off in to the sunset on Talon's dragon cycle. Talon walks over to Marco.''
|-
!Talon
| You wanna hang out?
|-
!
| ''Marco opens a portal and leaves Talon stranded. Scene changes to Star's bedroom.''
|-
!Star
| [sleepy] Uh... hello?
|-
!
| ''Marco's hovering by her with his scissors.''
|-
!Star
| [screams, grabs wand] Creepy blast!
|-
!Marco
| Aaagh! [groans]
|-
!Star
| Marco? What are you doing? And what are you doing with your scissors?!
|-
!Marco
| Okay, okay, I can explain.
|-
!Star
| First you're lying, and now you're stealing? What are you doing?
|-
!Marco
| I've been closing your portals. Uh, you've been opening them in different dimensions, and I've been closing them with Hekapoo.
|-
!Star
| Wha-wha-what? Does... does Hekapoo know about...
|-
!Marco
| Yeah. Yeah, she knows. She's not happy about it.
|-
!Star
| Oh, no. Oh, no, oh, no!
|-
!Marco
| Star, I like adventures, but I like keeping you safe more, so if I can stop doing this [snips scissors], can you stop doing that? [opens map]
|-
!Star
| Whoa, what is it?
|-
!Marco
| I think it's what you've been looking for.
