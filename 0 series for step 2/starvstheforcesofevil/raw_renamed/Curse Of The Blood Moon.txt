|''Episode begins in a dimly lit room at the Monster Temple. A ticking clock on the wall reads a few minutes before midnight. At a table with two chairs and two bowls, [[Star Butterfly|Star]] sits in a kneeling position in one of the chairs and stares at the ceiling.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|[sighs]
|-
!
|''[[Marco Diaz|Marco]] enters from off-screen carrying a lit candelabra.''
|-
!Star
|[whispering] Huh? What took you so long?! I've been waiting here forever!
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|[simultaneously] Sorry, sorry! I know, I know! I went the long way. I just don't like walking past [[Globgor]] at night. It gives me night terrors.
|-
!Star
|Oh, brother. So, what'd ya bring me?
|-
!Marco
|Well, why don't we just take a little peek? Bam!
|-
!
|''Marco lifts up his hoodie to reveal a box of [[Captain Blanche's Sugar Seeds]] pressed against his body.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Captain Blanche's Sugar Seeds?! Why are you so good to me?
|-
!Marco
|Special edition, too. Extra marshmallows. [shakes cereal box]
|-
!Star
|Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh! Don't wake the baby!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, right.
|-
!Star
|Just wait 'til midnight.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco stare at the clock until it strikes midnight.''
|-
!Clock
|[chiming, cuckoo sounds]
|-
!Star
|Go!
|-
!
|''Marco opens the box and pours cereal in the two bowls on the table. Star levitates a quart of milk and pours milk in the bowls.''
|-
!Clock
|[stops chiming]
|-
!
|''Star and Marco each take a spoonful of cereal.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|[clinks spoons together] Cheers!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco start eating the cereal.''
|-
!Star
|[mouth full] Mmm! These marshmallows are actually really good.
|-
!Marco
|[mouth full] Yeah, I know, right?
|-
!Star
|[talking indistinctly with mouth full] Mmm, mmm, mmm.
|-
!Marco
|[chuckles, mouth full] You got a little milk on your shirt.
|-
!Star
|[mouth full] Oh, really? [chuckles] Mmm. Mmm.
|-
!Star and Marco
|[slurping milk] Ahhhh.
|-
!Star
|Oh, no! One left!
|-
!
|''Star's cereal bowl has a duck-shaped marshmallow in it.''
|-
!Star
|Wouldn't want that little guy gettin' lonely.
|-
!
|''Star spits out a cogwheel-shaped marshmallow and drops it in the bowl.''
|-
!Star
|Now they have each other. Well, good night, Marco! [leaves]
|-
!
|''Marco stares at the marshmallows in Star's bowl. Scene cuts to Globgor's chamber; [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]] is brushing his crystal cage with toothpaste.''
|-
!Marco
|(''o.s.'') Eclipsa!
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|[gasps, turns to Marco] Marco! Haven't you learned by now not to sneak up on a magical queen?
|-
!Marco
|It's happening again.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, no. What is it this time?
|-
!Marco
|[shows Star's cereal bowl] Marshmallows.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Aww.
|-
!Marco
|She paired them up so they wouldn't be lonely! It's so... adorable! It's makin' my guts go... [growling] Bleh! And then I get warm. And then... And then... I-I sweat. I sweat a lot.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Augh.
|-
!Marco
|[tearing up] And then, my... my eyes h-have been welling up a little. Every time I think I'm over her and I like someone else, I get marshmallows.
|-
!Eclipsa
|[smiles]
|-
!Marco
|[tears up] Do you have a spell to make my feelings go away?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[hugs Marco] Oh, sweet baby boy. No. No, I do not. But you shouldn't be in such a rush to get rid of them.
|-
!Marco
|But they hurt.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Feelings are worth feeling, even if they hurt.[clears throat] Now, if you'll excuse us, I think Globgor would be rather embarrassed to have his teeth brushed in front of company.
|-
!Marco
|Oh! Oh, of course. Yeah. Uh, sorry, Globgor.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa goes back to brushing Globgor's teeth while Marco leaves the chamber. [[Janna Ordonia|Janna]] is leaning against the wall.''
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
|Hello, Marco.
|-
!Marco
|[does karate pose] Back off!
|-
!Janna
|[scoffs] Relax, "[[Mackie Hand]]".
|-
!Marco
|Oh, it's you.
|-
!Janna
|I heard your conversation with Eclipsa, and I think I might be able to help with your embarrassing little problem.
|-
!Marco
|Eh, nope. Don't say it. Do not—
|-
!Janna
|Hypnotism.
|-
!Marco
|[closes his eyes] No, Janna! You are not gonna hypnotize me again!
|-
!Janna
|Aw, come on. I'm just tryin' to help a friend.
|-
!Marco
|Friends don't hypnotize each other and make them hate their favorite food! I used to love nachos. Now the thought of them makes me— [gags] —queasy.
|-
!Janna
|Yeah, but it's better for you this way. Besides, ya look good.
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] Thanks. But I don't want to have nausea every time I think of Star. I just don't want to have feelings for her anymore.
|-
!Janna
|Don't worry. I totally got this.
|-
!Marco
|No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
|-
!Janna
|[snaps her fingers] "Chicken butt".
|-
!
|''Marco falls over unconscious. The toilet is heard flushing, and he wakes up in a women's restroom.''
|-
!Marco
|[sighs, stammers] The women's restroom? What the heck, Janna?!
|-
!Janna
|Don't thank me yet. Let's see if it worked. What do you think of Star's marshmallows now?
|-
!Marco
|[stares at marshmallows] ...They're still adorable.
|-
!Janna
|So, you're telling me I just wasted 14 hours of my life? Ugh. That's so annoying.
|-
!Marco
|Ugh. [buries his face in the bowl] I know what I have to do. I just don't wanna do it.
|-
!Janna
|What's that?
|-
!Marco
|I gotta... I gotta tell Star.
|-
!Janna
|And you think that's a solution?
|-
!Marco
|I'm walkin' around with a bowl of cereal here, Janna.
|-
!Janna
|[chuckles, runs out of the restroom] This is gonna be awkward.
|-
!
|''In Star's bedroom, she plays with a [[Laser puppies|laser puppy]] on her bed. Marco stands outside the bedroom door.''
|-
!Star
|Aw, my little baby puppy!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, no! It's too cute!
|-
!Star
|Oh, hey, Marco! Have you come to say hi to this little angel baby puppy?
|-
!Marco
|Star, can... can you put the puppy away? I-I have something to talk to you about.
|-
!Star
|Oh, okay. Hey, [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]]! Marco's got somethin' he wants to talk about!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, no!
|-
!
|''Tom lies on the floor under a pile of laser puppies.''
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|Oh, cool. [sits next to Star on the bed] What do you want to talk about, buuuuddy?
|-
!Marco
|[sweating] Uh, hey, Tom.
|-
!Janna
|[pulling up a chair] Wait, wait. Just one second. [sits in chair and eats popcorn] This should be good.
|-
!Marco
|Uh... Uh... Okay! Fine. [shows cereal bowl] Star, this kills me.
|-
!
|''Flies buzz around the marshmallows.''
|-
!Star
|My little sweet baby marshmallow friends?
|-
!Tom
|[grabs a marshmallow] Yoink! Delicious marshmallow friends!
|-
!Star
|Tom!
|-
!Tom
|What? There's still one more.
|-
!Star and Marco
|Exactly! [I/Star] didn't want that marshmallow to get lonely, so [I/she] gave her a friend! Now, it's all alone! How do you not see that?!
|-
!Marco
|It's adorable!
|-
!
|''Star drops the marshmallow back in the bowl and slowly backs away from Marco. She and Tom stare at him, disturbed, while Janna continues to eat popcorn.''
|-
!Marco
|Uhhh... Star? I'm havin' a problem... and I think it's you. I like every single thing about you. It's... It's unnatural.
|-
!Tom
|No, Marco. It's not unnatural. [stands up and walks toward Marco]
|-
!Janna
|This should be good.
|-
!Marco
|Look, Tom! Tom! I-I'm sorry, dude! I-I just needed to get this off my chest!
|-
!Tom
|[puts hand on Marco's shoulder] It's SUPERnatural. You're both cursed.
|-
!Star
|What? What are you talking about?
|-
!Tom
|[sighs] Remember the [[Blood Moon Ball (event)|Blood Moon Ball]]?
|-
!Star
|Yes...
|-
!Tom
|Right. Well, its actual name is the Blood Moon CURSE. The curse chooses two souls to be eternally bound under the light of the Blood Moon. And I took you in hopes that it would choose us, but it didn't. It... it chose you and Marco instead.
|-
!Star
|Wait. So we're cursed, and you knew about it?
|-
!Tom
|Yeah, but I-I-I kinda thought you knew, too.
|-
!Star
|No, Tom. I didn't know! How would I have known?!
|-
!Tom
|Well, I thought it was pretty clear! I mean, there was that guy who explained everything. The light? Remember the light? It chose you.
|-
!Star
|I thought that was a fun party light! I didn't know it was cursed!
|-
!Tom
|But you know you have feelings for Marco. And ''I'' know you have feelings for Marco. I mean, where did you think that came from?
|-
!Marco
|You have feelings for me?
|-
!Star
|[blushes, stammers] Because of the curse!
|-
!Tom
|Star, I'm sorry. I was an idiot back then. W-What can I do to make it up to you?
|-
!Star
|How about get rid of this curse?!
|-
!Tom
|Okay, well, my grandpa Relicor was the one to tell me about the Blood Moon.
|-
!Star
|Well, then, let's go talk with him. [pulls Tom by the arm]
|-
!Tom
|No, wait-wait-wait. He's never gonna talk about it with us. But he's got a study room with books on everything, so let's start there.
|-
!Star
|Fine. Let's just hurry up and break this thing. Right, Marco?
|-
!Marco
|[looking shocked and sad]
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Marco, what's wrong?
|-
!Marco
|I just... can't believe that all this has been because of some dumb curse. It... It's just... [sighs] ...confusing.
|-
!Star
|Hey. You're my best friend, and no curse is ever gonna change that. But if this thing is messing with us, let's smash it to a billion pieces!
|-
!Marco
|Yeah! Let's go destroy our feelings!
|-
!Star and Marco
|[high-five]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Relicor's study. In a picture of Relicor and his wife on the wall, the wife's face is clawed out.''
|-
!Janna
|Whoa! [touches gold statue of Relicor with muscles] Your grandpa's study is like my dream home.
|-
!Tom
|Yeah. It's his little man cave.
|-
!Star
|Little? He has, like, a billion books in here!
|-
!Marco
|Good thing he has a computer to search it all with. I love it when the elderly embrace technology.
|-
!
|''Marco searches "how to break the blood moon curse" on the Lucitor Archives computer.''
|-
!Marco
|It says here that moon curses are easily broken! "The accursed simply needs to stand in the exact spot where the curse was placed at the exact same cycle in the lunar calendar, and when the moon hits its apex..." [gasps] "...the curse shall be removed!"
|-
!Star
|Oh, easy. We can totally do that. When's the next Blood Moon?
|-
!Tom
|Uh, around 665 years from now.
|-
!Star and Marco
|[stunned silence]
|-
!Tom
|Ohhhh, right. You don't live that long.
|-
!Marco
|[walks away] I wanted to start a family. Fall in love. [sighs] What's the point if this curse is making all the decisions?
|-
!
|''Marco sits in what he believes to be a chair that looks like Relicor but is actually Relicor himself.''
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks, grabs onto Marco's head]
|-
!Marco
|[screams, runs around] What the heck is this thing?!
|-
!Tom
|Oh, no! Grandpa Relicor, calm down!
|-
!Marco
|Get him off, get him off, get him off!
|-
!Star
|Rainbow Fist Grab!
|-
!
|''Star uses a Rainbow Fist to pin Marco and Relicor to the wall.''
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieking]
|-
!Marco
|[screaming]
|-
!Tom
|Grandpa! I know I'm not supposed to be in here!
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|But I used the Blood Moon Curse.
|-
!Relicor
|... [inquisitive grunt]
|-
!Tom
|I used it, but it chose my friends. Now I really messed up their lives, and we can't find a way to break the curse.
|-
!Relicor
|[grunts, sniffs Marco]
|-
!Marco
|Uh, Tom?
|-
!Relicor
|[grunts, flies onto Star and sniffs her]
|-
!Star
|Uh, what's happening?
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|I-I-I don't know.
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|My grandpa says that I've doomed you both.
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks, takes out "Demon's Guide to Enchanted Rocks"]
|-
!Tom
|[takes book] But he says the Severing Stone might be able to help us.
|-
!Janna
|[grabs book] Yoink! [opens book] "The Severing Stone. This enchanted rock possesses an edge so sharp that it can sever anything, be it physical, emotional, or even magical. The Stone can be found at the deepest depths of the [[Underworld]]." Aw, man, this day gets better and better.
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|Uh, Relicor says he'll guide us to the Severing Stone, 'cause he's my grandpa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-paaaaaaaaaa.
|-
!Star
|Okay... [poofs Rainbow Fist away]
|-
!Marco
|Wait, is he just staying up there—?
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieking]
|-
!
|''Relicor flies to the other side of the room while carrying Marco. They slam into a shelf, and Relicor pulls one of the books.''
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|He's saying to back up.
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!
|''The bookshelf Relicor pulled a book from suddenly erupts in flames, and a demon elevator rises out of the ground. With a ding, the elevator doors open.''
|-
!Marco
|You know, this elevator might not be worth burnin' a shelf of books every time you wanna use it.
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Marco
|Just sayin'.
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, Tom, Janna, and Relicor enter the elevator. It lowers into the ground. Scene cuts to black, then cuts to elevator interior.''
|-
!Tom
|[whistling, stretching his arms]
|-
!Marco
|[chuckling]
|-
!Star
|Why are you a lil' giggly boy over there?
|-
!Marco
|[laughs] Oh, I-I-I forgot I had this cereal bowl in my pocket. And, uh, the cereal's all... all mushy.
|-
!Tom
|[still whistling]
|-
!Star and Marco
|Tom!
|-
!Tom
|What did I do?
|-
!Marco
|You're an elevator whistler!
|-
!Star
|And you were doing that little thing we talked about. That little stretchy yoga thing. In public. That I hate.
|-
!Tom
|So... What? We gonna... what, just dump on Tom now?! Is that it?!
|-
!Star
|No, it's just... When you do that, your shirt comes up and...
|-
!Relicor
|[annoyed grumble]
|-
!
|''The elevator stops.''
|-
!All but Janna
|[gasps]
|-
!Star
|We stopped.
|-
!
|''The doors open to reveal a landscape populated by Underworld creatures with multiple eyeballs.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') What?
|-
!Marco
|(''o.s.'') Where are we?
|-
!Relicor
|[grunting]
|-
!Tom
|Uh, he, uh... he says it's not the right floor.
|-
!
|''Relicor crawls on the elevator's ceiling and talks at the elevator-operating demon.''
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieking]
|-
!Elevator Operator
|Well, this is as far as I go. Sorry. It's the way it is.
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieking, extends a fingernail]
|-
!Elevator Operator
|Uh, sir? Do not... do not do that.
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks, saws elevator rope]
|-
!Elevator Operator
|[holding camera phone] Everything... Everything you're doing is being recorded!
|-
!
|''Relicor cuts through the elevator rope, causing it to plummet to the ground.''
|-
!All
|[screaming]
|-
!Star
|Super Inflatable Bounce House Blast!
|-
!
|''Star creates a bouncy castle to soften the elevator's landing. The elevator doors open, and Star, Marco, Tom, and Janna are on the floor.
|-
!All
|[groaning]
|-
!Relicor
|[flies out of elevator]
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, Tom, Janna, and Relicor walk through the Underworld's deepest level. Something at the other end of a rope bridge glows bright blue.''
|-
!Marco
|Wow. That must be the Severing Stone!
|-
!Relicor
|[mocking grumble]
|-
!Tom
|You want me to translate that for you, Marco?
|-
!Marco
|No. It's fine, Tom. I think I got it. Thanks.
|-
!Janna
|Hey, shut up. Look!
|-
!
|''Janna steps on a sigil that glows red. A giant tower rises out of the ground, blocking off the rope bridge. The top half of a door at the base of the tower opens to reveal a cloak-wearing demon.
|-
!Star
|Oh, great demon thing! What is it that you want from us?
|-
!Marco
|Wait, are you serious? Ugh. Isn't it painfully obvious that this creep is some sort of bridge troll? He just came up out of the ground to block our path. Over a very rickety bridge, I might add. Now there's gonna be some crazy thing we gotta do to pay the toll. Feed him a goat or something. There's always a thing! Any second, this creep's gonna be all like, [creepy voice] "If you wanna cross my bridge, you must, uh, uh, uh, uh, lift this couch that magically appeared up these 30 stairs!" And then the five of us are gonna try to lift this stupid thing up the stairs, and it's not gonna work, and the creepy guy's gonna be all like— Uh, sorry. What... What's your name?
|-
!Abraxacan
|Abraxacan.
|-
!Marco
|Thanks. Then Abraxacan is gonna be all like – and I know this is a bad impression – [creepy voice] "The couch can only be lifted by the right pairing!" Ugh! And we're gonna be all exhausted and stuff. And we're gonna be like, "Duh! It has to be me and Star who lift the couch!" Just us. Because our souls are bonded.
|-
!Abraxacan
|Bound.
|-
!Marco
|Thank you. Bound. Together. Anyway... [sighs] Grab an end, Star. Let's get this thing over with.
|-
!Tom
|Um, I don't know if all that was completely obvious. To me. Maybe I'm alone.
|-
!Marco
|[laughs] No way. This thing's got a bed inside of it. [chuckling] Oh, yeah. It's gonna weigh a ton. [tries to lift the couch]
|-
!Vexicor
|(''o.s.'') Stop!
|-
!
|''Another cloak-wearing demon appears through a fog.''
|-
!Vexicor
|[exhaling menacingly]
|-
!Abraxacan
|No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, no, no, no!
|-
!Vexicor
|[holding fast food bag and sodas, slurps soda] Ahhhh... Abraxacan, what are these people doing here?
|-
!Abraxacan
|They're... moving the couch.
|-
!Vexicor
|I can see that. But ''why'' are they moving the couch?
|-
!Abraxacan
|To get across the bridge.
|-
!Vexicor
|Right. But if they want to cross the bridge... [draws sword] ...they have to fight us to the death!
|-
!Abraxacan
|Um, yeah. I just thought they'd do that ''after'' they moved—
|-
!Vexicor
|Please stop talking. Please stop talking.
|-
!Abraxacan
|I mean... somebody's gotta move the couch.
|-
!Vexicor
|Well, hire movers! Just like everybody else!
|-
!Star and Marco
|[look at each other]
|-
!Vexicor
|Ugh. Just... lower the tower. This is a total mess.
|-
!Abraxacan
|Fine.
|-
!
|''Abraxacan spins a steering wheel, and the tower starts to lower back into the ground.''
|-
!Vexicor
|You forgot to close the door.
|-
!Abraxacan
|What?
|-
!
|''The top half of the tower's door breaks off as the tower lowers into the ground.''
|-
!Star
|I have no idea what just happened, but let's go before they change their minds.
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, Tom, Janna, and Relicor cross the rope bridge.''
|-
!Marco
|[panting] This bridge is a death trap.
|-
!
|''The bridge starts to violently shake.''
|-
!All
|[exclaiming]
|-
!Janna
|[hanging off the bridge] Aah! Help! Help me!
|-
!Star
|Janna!
|-
!Janna
|[pulls herself back up] No, I'm kidding. I have really strong fingers. I had you fooled, though! You should have seen yo' faces! [chuckles]
|-
!
|''The group reaches the other end of the bridge and sees the Severing Stone.''
|-
!Star
|So, that's the Severing Stone?
|-
!Relicor
|[kneels before Severing Stone, clears throat, high-pitched shriek]

!

!Tom
|I don't speak Severing Stone.
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|Ohhh! He says the Stone is asking why we're here.
|-
!Star
|[clears throat] Oh, Severing Stone, we wish to sever our souls, which were bound in the light of the Blood Moon.
|-
!Severing Stone
|[plays notes]
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|He says that'll be easy. Just hop up on the stage.
|-
!Star and Marco
|Let's do this.
|-
!
|''Relicor suddenly runs ahead of Star and Marco...''
|-
!Marco
|Huh?
|-
!Star
|Huh? Relicor?
|-
!
|''...and shrieks in anger at the Severing Stone.''
|-
!Tom
|Gramps? What are you doing?
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieking, shaking his fist]
|-
!Severing Stone
|[plays notes]
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks sadly, whimpers, flies off stage]
|-
!Tom
|[kneels down next to Relicor] Okay... What was that all about?
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|Relicor says he came to the Severing Stone once before, thousands of years ago...
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|...because he wanted to sever his soul from my great-grandma, but...
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|...but to do so, he had to sacrifice the memory of the moment they first fell in love. Now, he can never have that memory back. And he says he's regretted it ever since.
|-
!Relicor
|[sobbing, shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|The Stone says the severing is permanent. But that's cool, 'cause that's... that's what we all want, right?
|-
!
|''Star and Marco nod to each other.''
|-
!Marco
|Janna, would you mind holding this? [gives Star's bowl to Janna]
|-
!Janna
|No, I'm cool.
|-
!Marco
|[looks annoyed]
|-
!Tom
|I got you, bro.
|-
!Marco
|[gives bowl to Tom] Thanks, ''Tom''.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco step onto the Severing Stone's stage.''
|-
!Star
|So, we have to sacrifice the memory of the moment our souls were bonded.
|-
!Marco
|When we danced.
|-
!Star
|Yeah.
|-
!Marco
|Okay, so... like this, I guess?
|-
!
|''Star and Marco take each other's hands and turn around as if dancing.''
|-
!Star
|I mean, I think so.
|-
!Tom
|Hey! Hey, that dance was meant for me! [laughs] I'm just kidding.
|-
!Star
|Are we sure this is what we're—?
|-
!
|''The stage under Star and Marco's feet starts to glow.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|Whoa...!
|-
!
|''They look up and see the Blood Moon skylight, and they're suddenly at the Blood Moon Ball in their ball outfits.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|It's the Blood Moon Ball!
|-
!Star
|Oh, my gosh, outfits and everything! Are you guys seeing this?
|-
!
|''Tom, Janna, and Relicor are gone.''
|-
!Star
|Wow. Wow-wow-wow-wow-WOW. Marco, I think we're ''in'' our memories.
|-
!
|''The Blood Moon's light shines on Star and Marco through the skylight, and [[Blood Moon Waltz]] starts playing.''

!Marco
|I guess we gotta go for it. [pulls Star into a dance]
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Star and Marco starts dancing under the moonlight.''
|-
!Star
|Aww, you look so cute in your mask.
|-
!Marco
|Uh, naw.
|-
!Star
|Oh, right! I also never told you you had corn chip crumbs on your tie.
|-
!Marco
|Aw...
|-
!Star
|[laughs]
|-
!Marco
|[laughs] Well, that's embarrassing. [sighs] Uh, this would have been the part where Tom shoved me halfway across the ballroom.
|-
!Star
|This feels... new.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco continue to spin around the dance floor.''
|-
!Star
|Where have you been hiding these dance moves, Diaz?
|-
!Marco
|Nowhere. I mean, I just keep on dancin', you know? That's what Grandma said. "Just keep dancing, even if you look silly."
|-
!
|''Star and Marco's dancing reaches a crescendo as Marco dips Star, and they keep spinning around each other.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|[laughing]
|-
!Star
|Aww. [laughs]
|-
!
|''Star's facial expression changes from joy to worry.''
|-
!Star
|Marco... I'm really scared.
|-
!Marco
|Don't worry. It's gonna work.
|-
!Star
|That's what I'm scared of. [looks up at skylight] I-I-I don't want my destiny determined by some creepy curse, but... I like this.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco's grip on each other's hands gets tighter. Marco lifts his Dia de Los Muertos mask.''
|-
!Marco
|Yeah? So do I.
|-
!Star
|[tearing up] What if it was never the Blood Moon?
|-
!
|''The ballroom skylight suddenly breaks in two, and the waltz music winds down. Scene cuts back to the Severing Stone's stage, and Star and Marco open their eyes.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|[groaning]
|-
!Severing Stone
|[plays note]
|-
!Star and Marco
|Aah!
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|He says it is done.
|-
!Janna
|W-W-Wait. What happened? You, like, turned around once, and that was it.
|-
!Star
|I don't know. I feel like I just woke up from, like, a weird nap.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, we were at the Blood Moon Ball, and we were dancing, and then... W-What were we just doing?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, I... I don't remember. How do we know it even worked?
|-
!Tom
|Well, here. [holds out Star's bowl] The cornshmallows. Do these cornshmallows give you any... feelings?
|-
!Marco
|[stares at marshmallows] Huh. I just see two gross pieces of cereal!
|-
!Star
|What about when you look at me?
|-
!Marco
|[stares at Star] I see... my best friend.
|-
!Star
|Me, too. [hugs Marco]
|-
!Tom
|Whoo! [laughs] Oh, well, now things are only a little awkward! Instead of very awkward, which it was for, like, a year. [shudders] I felt so much guilt every single day.
|-
!Star
|Tom, you should have. But it's okay.
|-
!Tom
|[smiles]
|-
!Star
|Let's just get outta here.
|-
!Severing Stone
|[plays note off-screen]
|-
!Janna
|[cackling]
|-
!Star
|Janna?
|-
!Janna
|I did it! I got my soul severed from itself! Whoo! [laughs]
|-
!Star
|What?! Oh, Janna, come on! Why would you do that?
|-
!Janna
|Now I have two souls. I'm pretty much a demon.
|-
!Tom
|Uh, Janna, it... it doesn't work like that.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, now you just have two halves of the same soul.
|-
!Janna
|So I'm half-demon. Still counts.
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks, jumps onto Marco again]
|-
!Marco
|[screams] Okay, you know, I will be waiting in the elevator.
