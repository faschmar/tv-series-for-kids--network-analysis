|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Star, let's go! We've been here for hours.
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|No! We're not leaving until the old donuts get thrown out.

|''Mina Loveberry pops out of the garbage bin with the garbage bag and falls out, the donuts coming out of the bag.''
|-
![[Mina Loveberry]]
|Oh no, no, no, no, no, no!
|-
!Marco
|Star? Some lady just got your donuts.

|What?
|-

|''Star gasps.''
|-
!Star
|Mina...
|-
!
|''Star walks over to Mina.''
|-
!Star
|You're Mina Loveberry!
|-
!Mina
|Ya caught me! Are you a cop?
|-
!Star
|[to Marco] That's Mina Loveberry.
|-
!Marco
|I have no idea who that is.
|-
!Star
|Marco! She's the greatest warrior to ever live.
|-
!Marco
|Uh, her?
|-
!Mina
|I lost my bag! Has anyone seen my bag? Has anyone seen my bag?
|-
!Marco
|That's a lady who's lost her marbles.
|-
!Star
|No, she's Mina Loveberry.
|-
!Mina
|[in background] Hello!
|-
!Star
|Mewni's greatest protector. At least I think that's her.
|-
!Marco
|Well why don't you see for yourself?
|-
!Star
|No, no, no, no, no. Marco, Marco, no!
|-
!
|''Marco pushes Star over to Mina.''
|-
!Star
|[nervously] Hello, Mina.
|-
!Mina
|Hello!
|-
!Star
|What are you doing on Earth?
|-
!Mina
|I'm on vacation! Doctor's orders!
|-
!Star
|Wh-wh-wh-what are you gonna do on your vacation?
|-
!Mina
|I will let the soul be my guide and wander off to the depths of this unseen planet.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Wow!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|That's what you say when you've lost your marbles.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Okay Marco, just... [pushes him] There is actually a really great park across the street.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Fantastic! The perfect place to view humanity at its most docile. I will leave in two seconds. [walks away backwards]
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Boy, what a weirdo. Star? [no response] Oh no.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[following behind] Wait. Wait, Mina. Wait. Teach me your ways, O great warrior.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Hmm. Yeah. Okay.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Really? O great Mina, you will not be disappointed.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|But ain't nothin' for free. You're gonna have to do something for me.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Anything.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Get this bag off my head.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[starts tugging]
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Ooh, ow. A, E, I, O, U! Ahh. Ow.
|-
!
|''Over in the park''
|-
!'''Park Ranger'''
| Welcome to the Echo Creek Mud Pits. Here, we will answer all your questions about mud.
|-
!'''Woman'''
|Finally
|-
!'''Star'''
|Today I go where Mina goes. Look at us; we're already basically best friends. Inseparable.
|-
!
|''Mina with Star on her back goes down into the mud pit. ''
|-
!'''Ranger'''
| Boy, are you guys in for a real educational treat today.
|-
!'''Mina'''
| Lesson number first. In becoming a great warrior, one must cleanse their mind from thinking thought.
|-
!'''Star'''
| So... just don't think?
|-
!'''Mina'''
| Don't think.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh, it feels so good.
|-
!
|''Mina mentions for Star to put mud on her face.''
|-
!'''Mina'''
| We are mud sisters.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [giggles excitedly]
|-
!'''Mina'''
| Wait a second. [points at a fake mammoth] Where's my camera, where's my telescope, where's my sketch pad? What the heck is that?
|-
!'''Ranger'''
|Observe the woolly mammoth who may or may not have walked through these mud pits 19 million years ago. We're not really sure.
|-
!
|''Mina climbs on top of the mammoth''
|-
!'''Mina'''
| Ride, my great beast. Ride to the cloud city of Cloudlandia!
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Get down, ya weirdo.
|-
!'''Mina'''
| Come on, big boy. Let's get to movin'.
|-
!'''Ranger'''
|Uh ma'am, you leave that mammoth alone.
|-
!'''Mina'''
| [pushes mammoth] I command ye to move.
|-
!'''Ranger'''
| That's it. I'm comin' in to get you ma'am. Sorry, you can't be doin' that. [screams, sinks into mud] Whoa, goin' down.
|-
!'''Mina'''
| Aah, what a cruel twist of fate.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Star, she's clearly lost it.
|-
!'''Mina'''
| [on top of sunken mammoth] I am the conqueror of the beast. No autographs.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Lesson number one Marco. Just stop thinkin'.
|-
!
|''In a different area of the park''
|-
!'''Mina'''
| Now class, meaning you, our next lesson is of utmost importance to the survival of a warrior. We're gonna learn how to make some weapons.
|-
!'''Kid on swing'''
| The higher I go, the closer I get to reaching the stars.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Be resourceful with finding material. [rips chain]
|-
!'''Kid'''
|[screams]
|-
!'''Mina'''
| See? Now I have a sturdy chain to chain stuff with. Easy breezy taco peasy. Go make your own warrior weapon.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Alright Star, you got this. It's just like arts and crafts, but with weapons.
|-
!
|''Marco watches from a park bench with a lady''
|-
!'''Lady'''
|Which ones are yours?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[sighs] Those two [points towards a screaming Mina]
|-
!'''Lady'''
|Oh bless your soul.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Come on Star, anything can be a weapon. [sees a shoelace] Oh my goodness. Look at this string. How lucky could I be? Oh, and what is this? A pine cone? Everything's comin' up Star.
|-
!'''Kid'''
|Let go of my bat, you naughty lady.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|[grabs it, sticks out tongue]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Mina, did you finish building your weapon yet?
|-
!'''Mina'''
|I have created the most deadly of maces [holds bat]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Awesome! You know, I'm actually pretty proud of mine too.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Uh, kazza kazza wha?
|-
!'''Star'''
|It is a pine cone tied to a string, and then, I put some flowers on it and drew a face. I call him Davey.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Fantastic! Ho!
|-
!'''Star'''
|Ho!
|-
!
|''On the park bench''
|-
!'''Lady'''
|[to Marco] You know, when they turn 18, they're the government's problem.
|-
!
|''At a hot dog stand''
|-
!'''Vendor'''
| Hot dogs here. Get your hot dogs. Hot dogs.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Lesson number tres. You gotta gather intel. Sh, someone may be listening. Learn from your new surroundings.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[writing] Learn from new surroundings.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|[pokes a woman's hair] Oh sorry. I didn't know it was a wig. Who is your ruler on this planet?
|-
!'''Woman'''
|[laughs] Not from around here, are we?
|-
!'''Star'''
|She's a foreigner.
|-
!'''Woman'''
| Oh, how exotic. This is the United States of America. We don't have any rulers here. We're free.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|But how makes the rules?
|-
!'''Vendor'''
| We make our own rules. [eats half of a customer's hot dog] through the radical process [grabs the customer's money] of voting.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|[screeches] Just trying to wrap my head around this. You mean you vote if you can do something or not?
|-
!'''Random Cowboy'''
| That's right little lady.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|So, I can do this? [stands on two people's backs]
|-
!'''Woman'''
|Sure.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|[juggles] And this too?
|-
!'''Star'''
|You betcha.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Is this legal? [sets hot dog cart on fire]
|-
!'''Vendor'''
| Actually, that's arson [laughs]
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Freedom!
|-
!'''Crowd'''
|Freedom!
|-
!'''Mina'''
|No chains or limitations. I'm freedom!
|-
!
|''Marco is flabbergasted.''
|-
!'''Mina'''
|We have learned there are no rules on this planet. It's an anything goes fight to the death.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Star, wait. You've gotta stop this.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Stop what? What am I doing?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| You guys ruined the entire park today.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Marco, Mina was my idol growing up. Imagine if you randomly met your idol one day and didn't follow them around.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|But your idol is bananas.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Look, thanks for trying to look out for me, but I'm gonna go train with my hero.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Fine. I'm just gonna enjoy the park by myself.
|-
!
|''Police arrive''
|-
!'''Officer 1'''
| Sir, we're gonna have to ask you a couple of questions.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[hikes up hill] Alright, step one. Just stop thinking. Step two make a weapon. Step tres. Gather intel. [pants] Mina. I made it.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Come, little mud face. You must partake in the warrior's ritual. Step inside the circle of animals.
|-
!
|''Star steps inside''
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Now, repeat these words:
|-
!'''Star'''
|Repeat these words.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Not these words, the ones coming.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Right. Sorry.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|O great battle lords.
|-
!'''Star'''
|O great battle lords.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Please protect us.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Please protect us.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Carry our foes off to the depths of space and time to they may forever live in the ruins of our victory.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [mutters gibberish] victory.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Lead us to the battle and you shall bathe in our conquests. Ha! [makes weird noises]
|-
!'''Star'''
|So, mud sister, what are we battling? So demons? Gargoyles?
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Them people [points]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Joggers?
|-
!'''Mina'''
|No, ding-dong. All the people of this forsaken planet.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[laughs] No. You don't mean that. That's wacky talk.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|What these little ants lack is a ruler. And guess who's gonna give 'em one? [touches Star's nose] Bink. Now, [to everyone] kneel before your new ruler.
|-
!'''Man'''
|Okay.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Ha ha. We're gonna have so much fun rulin' these folks.
|-
!'''Star'''
|I've made a huge mistake.
|-
!
|''Scene changes back to Marco and the police.''
|-
!'''Officer 1'''
|So a gonzo donut collector came out of a dumpster.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Uh huh.
|-
!'''Officer 1'''
|To teach your friend, another gonzo donut collector in a dumpster.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Yep
|-
!'''Officer 1'''
|And together, they destroyed a family park?
|-
!'''Officer 2'''
| Yeah. If I was trying to cover my butt, I'd say the exact same thing.
|-
!'''Mina'''
| [far away] Kneel before me, minions. I am the greatest warrior that this world has ever known!
|-
!
|''Police turn on their sirens''
|-
!'''Officer 1'''
| Let's ride.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Mina, I can't take over the Earth.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Ah, of course you can. You're a warrior now. Now let's start by rounding up the rest of these folks, and pushin' 'em off this here ledge.
|-
!'''Man'''
|[nervous giggle]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Mina, I care about Earth; I don't wanna conquer it.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|I thought you cared about being a warrior! [floats into sky; her body becomes larger and more muscular, and her voice deepens]
|-
!'''Star'''
|I guess I thought being a warrior was something different.
|-
!'''Man'''
|Uh, excuse me miss. Don't we get a vote in this?
|-
!'''Crowd'''
|Yeah!
|-
!'''Mina'''
|What are you, a bunch of comedians? We ain't votin' on this. I'm your ruler now.
|-
!'''Man'''
|Mm, all those in favor of the crazy lady being our new ruler, raise your hands. [pause] One, two... six. Okay. All those opposed. [pause] One, two... five, six. Looks like we have ourselves a draw. Hey, did anybody not vote?
|-
!'''Star'''
|Me. I didn't vote.
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Come on. You got mud on your face; we're a team. We can rule this land together, mud sister.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[wipes off mud] No. You're bananas, Mina. Like the bad kind.
|-
!'''Man'''
|Hey, freedom wins again.
|-
!'''Crowd'''
|[cheers]
|-
!'''Mina'''
|I thought you were a warrior, but you're just a little girl living on a stupid freedom planet. [grabs Star's weapon] You don't even deserve this.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Davey!
|-
!'''Mina'''
|Ha! I wouldn't dare rule over this loony bin [crawls into a dumpster]
|-
!
|''Police arrives on scene.''
|-
!'''Officer 1'''
|Attention citizens. We are looking for
|-
!'''Star'''
| She's in there.
|-
!'''Officer 2'''
|[opens dumpster] Uh, there's nothing inside.
|-
!'''Officer 1'''
| Magic does exist. I repeat, magic does exist.
|-
!'''Star'''
|You were right, Marco. Mina was a lady with no marbles.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|You wanna go check behind the French bakery for some day-old baguettes?
|-
!'''Star'''
|Of course I do.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to Mewni.''
|-
!'''Mina'''
|[to Davey] Boop. Mud sister.
|-
!
|''Camera zooms out to show Mina sitting under a tree. She has reverted to her normal appearance.''
