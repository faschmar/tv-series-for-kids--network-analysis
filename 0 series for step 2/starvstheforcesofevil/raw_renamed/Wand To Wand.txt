|''Scene opens in a lodge in the woods. Inside, many rats socialize while eating porridge out of glass bowls. The door opens; bird and spider walk in holding Ludo, dropping him at the host's counter.''
|-
!'''[[Ludo]]'''
| I'm glad you're open. I'm starving. I'd like some porridge, please.

|-
!'''Ludo'''

|-
!'''Ludo'''
| You messed with the wrong bird, rat. Face-melting death ray! [nothing happens] Huh?
|-
!
|''Ludo shrieks as he, bird, and spider are thrown out of the lodge. His wand hits him in the head.''

| It's your turn to take out the garbage.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Marco, you've ruined my Mewni battleship. 
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Don't you think you have enough ships in a bottle?
|-
!'''Star'''
| Enough? I don't even know you.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Come on. We told Mom and Dad we'd have the place cleaned up before they got home, and garbage is all yours. 
|-
!'''Star'''

|-
!'''Cloudy'''
| Yeah. Perfectly fine [eye moves out of place]
|-
!'''Star'''
| Okay. Could you take out the garbage?
|-
!'''Cloudy'''
| Sure can. I guess princess hands are too delicate to touch garbage [chuckles] 
|-
!'''Star'''
| What?
|-
!'''Cloudy'''
| Oh, nothing [grabs trash bag, bumps into wall] Excuse me. [bumps into door] Pardon me, I got a mouthful of garbage.

|-
!'''Ludo'''
| [stares at wand] I don't know girls. Maybe this isn't what it looks like. It looks like a magic wand but...
|-
!'''Spider'''
| [tries to grab it]
|-
!'''Ludo'''
| What did I say? Follow three feet behind me. Three! Yeah, anyway, I don't know, maybe it's just a baby rattle.
|-
!'''Spider'''
| [grabs wand]
|-
!'''Ludo'''
| What are you doing? No. No, put it down.

|-
!'''Ludo'''
| Not you, you stupid...
|-
!'''Bird'''
| [throws Ludo]
|-
!'''Ludo'''

|-
!
|''The wand illuminates green light, dragging Ludo further away. Ludo smiles and runs back.''

!'''Ludo'''
| Oh no no. No no! I was kidding
|-
!'''Spider'''

!'''Star'''
| Glossaryck! 
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Inside voices please.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh, sorry. Yeah. Uh, Glossaryck, there's something funky happening with my wand.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Oh. What's wrong with it?
|-
!'''Star'''
| It's acting weird. It's not doing what it's supposed to. 
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Look Star, maybe there's something wrong with you. You ever think about that? 
|-
!'''Star'''
| And what's that supposed to mean? 
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Uh, I'm not 100% sure. I guess it means there's something wrong with everyone. I mean, look at me. I did magic on my own face. You know?
|-
!'''Star'''
| No help as usual. 
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| It hurts everywhere!

|-
!
|''A rat smacks Ludo's face with a mop into a wall.''
|-
!'''Ludo'''
| Now you're really starting to tick me off.
