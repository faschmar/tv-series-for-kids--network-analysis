|''Scene opens at [[Echo Creek Academy]].''
|-
![[Jackie Lynn Thomas]]
|[talking to Lynn] Oh, Minnesota, huh? Fancy.
|-
!
|''[[Marco Diaz]] peers at Jackie from behind his locker. He's nervous, and his armpits are sweaty. ''
|-
!Marco
|Okay, you got this. [fanning his sweaty pits, whispers to his reflection] Today is the day.
|-
!Jackie
|Hey, Marco.
|-
!Marco
|[gasps]
|-
!Jackie
|Today is the day for what?
|-
!Marco
|Oh, uh... today is the day... I was going to ask you a question.
|-
!Jackie
|Okay.
|-
!Marco
|Jackie, I was wondering if you'd like to go out... and get me some paper towels for Marco's sweaty pits. [gasps]
|-
!Jackie
|Uh...
|-
!Marco
|No, no, no, no! That is not what I meant to say! What I meant to say is the sweat is gushing down Marco's back like a waterfall.
|-
!Jackie
|[laughs nervously]
|-
!Marco
|Now it's crossing the border into Marco's undies. Aaaah!
|-
!Jackie
|Okay, well, Jackie is going to go now and get Marco some paper towels for his wet body. [walks away]
|-
!Marco
|[panics, runs away]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to later in the cafeteria.''
|-
!Marco
|[banging head against table] That! Was! So! Stupid! Ugh.
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Hey, hey, now, Marco. It's not that big a deal.
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
|I heard what happened. Everyone's talking about it. Welp, looks like you should just give up on dating forever.
|-
!Marco
|Thanks for the vote of confidence. [sighs] I'm not gonna let being tongue-tied stop me. Pen me!
|-
!
|''Star gives Marco a pen, and he starts writing on a piece of paper.''
|-
!Marco
|"Jackie, will you go out with me Friday night?" [walks up to Jackie] Hey, uh, Jackie?
|-
!Jackie
|Oh, hey, there you are. I got your paper towels.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, uh... [nervous giggle] Here's some paper for you. [hands paper to Jackie]
|-
!Jackie
|[reading letter] "Marco can't grow hair on his chin, but he can on his back"?
|-
!Janna
|Ha!
|-
!Marco
|What?! [grabs the note, reads in a whisper] "Marco can't grow hair on his chin, but he can on his back"?!
|-
!
|''Marco nervously backs away from Jackie and crashes into Chet, spilling his lunch on his jacket.''
|-
!Chet
|Bro, my jacket.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, uh, sorry, Chet.
|-
!Chet
|No worries. It's just a material possession.
|-
!Marco
|Marco thinks Chet should punch him.
|-
!Chet
|What?
|-
!Marco
|No, no, no! I mean, if-if Marco were Chet, he'd totally punch Marco.
|-
!Chet
|It's just a jacket, dude.
|-
!Marco
|[grabbing Chet's arm] Marco would lose all respect for Chet if Chet didn't punch Marco?!
|-
!Chet
|Don't... Don't make me do this bro.
|-
!Marco
|Ow!
|-
!
|''Marco blacks out as he pulls Chet's fist into his face. Scene reemerges at a drinking fountain; Marco flushes his black eye with water.''
|-
!Star
|What happened in there?
|-
!Marco
|I don't know what got into me. Every time I'm around Jackie, I keep blurting out the wrong thing.
|-
!
|''Jackie walks by.''
|-
!Marco
|Every night when Marco goes to sleep, he shapes his pillow in the form of Jackie Lynn Thomas! [gasps, closes mouth] And kisses it goodnight!
|-
!Jackie
|Did you say something?
|-
!
|''Marco muffles his speech with his hands. After it cuts out, he falls over and starts groaning. Black clouds gather in the sky.''
|-
!Star
|Marco, what's happening?
|-
!Janna
|Wait. Let's see where this goes.
|-
!
|''Marco continues to scream until a smaller head pops out of his neck.''
|-
![[Naysaya (character)|Naysaya]]
|Hello.
|-
!Star
|[screams] ...Oh, you made a little Marco Junior.
|-
!Janna
|'Sup, Marco Junior? [shakes hand]
|-
!Marco
|Janna, that's... that's not his hand. That's...
|-
!Naysaya
|Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Marco Diaz covers the mirror when he showers because... because, because Marco is ashamed of his own body!
|-
!Star
|Oh, it's so adorable.
|-
!Marco
|Are you crazy?! How am I ever gonna ask out Jackie like this?!
|-
!Jackie
|Hey, guys.
|-
!Marco
|[gasps, hides behind Janna]
|-
!Janna
|Hey.
|-
!Jackie
|Did any of you get the English homework assignment?
|-
!Naysaya
|Marco thinks...
|-
!
|''Marco muffles the little head with his hoodie.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, I can show you, Jackie. Come with me. [leads Jackie off-screen]
|-
!Janna
|That's it. I remember where I've seen you before.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to Marco's locker as Janna opens it.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey, where'd you get my combination?
|-
!Janna
|From your diary.
|-
!
|''Janna removes the back panel to reveal a hole in the wall lit by a candle.''
|-
!Marco
|What is that stuff?
|-
!Janna
|Just some of my personal things.
|-
!
|''Janna pulls out a book entitled "Paranormal Folklore and Witchcraft, 5th Edition".''
|-
!Janna
|I've seen Marco Junior somewhere before.
|-
!Marco
|Stop calling it that!
|-
!Janna
|[flips to a page] Here. "The Naysaya. The Naysaya grows out of the neck of its victim."
|-
!Naysaya
|Yes, that is Naysaya when Naysaya was younger.
|-
!Janna
|"It reveals itself when the afflicted attempts to woo their true love, exposing the victim's deepest, darkest secrets for all to hear."
|-
!Naysaya
|And to judge.
|-
!Marco
|[pointing at figure in background] What the heck is that thing?
|-
!Janna
|Oh, that's a demon. The Naysaya is a total demon curse.
|-
!Marco
|[groans] A demon.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]]'s abode, where he is seen playing video games.''
|-
!Tom
|Dude, I'm so sorry. I totally put that curse on you to prevent you from asking out Star.
|-
!Marco
|Why would you do something like that?
|-
!Tom
|That was before we started hanging out. You haven't asked out a girl since the [[Blood Moon Ball (event)|Blood Moon Ball]]? [laughs] That's way more embarrassing than that thing on your neck.
|-
!Marco
|How do I get rid of it?
|-
!Tom
|Eh, just let it run its course. Once it's shouted all your worst, most shameful secrets, it'll wear off.
|-
!Marco
|And how long will that take?
|-
!Tom
|It depends. How insecure are you?
|-
!Marco
|...Oh. no. [pulls out [[dimensional scissors]] and opens a portal]
|-
!Tom
|Good luck, dude.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the [[Diaz Household]]; Marco hides under a pile of pillows in his bedroom. Star knocks on Marco's door.''
|-
!Star
|Marco? What did Tom say?
|-
!Naysaya
|Thomas says Marco will have Naysaya for the rest of his life because... because, because Marco is ''so'' insecure!
|-
!Marco
|You should get back to school. You're missing class.
|-
!Star
|Well, aren't you coming too?
|-
!Marco
|I won't be going to school anymore.
|-
!Star
|What?
|-
!
|''Star looks at her finger. She slides it under the door with two hearts, two eyes, and a mouth drawn on it. She rotates the little face towards Marco.''
|-
!Star
|Marco, it's just a demon curse. Don't let Naysaya keep you from what you want. [sighs] Okay. The door is cutting off the circulation to my finger, so I better get going. Ooh, tingly.
|-
!Naysaya
|She's a good friend.
|-
!Marco
|Alright, dude. What do you want to keep your mouth shut?
|-
!Naysaya
|What?
|-
!Marco
|What do you want?
|-
!Naysaya
|M-Marco wants to know what Naysaya wants? But no one has ever asked what Naysaya wants.
|-
!Marco
|Well, dude, it's your lucky day. What do you want?
|-
!Naysaya
|May Naysaya have whatever he pleases?
|-
!Marco
|As long as you let me ask Jackie out, you can have whatever you want.
|-
!Naysaya
|Then Naysaya would like... cereal.
|-
!Marco
|Seriously? You... You can have cereal.
|-
!Naysaya
|But... b-b-but... Naysaya would like to enjoy cereal in Naysaya's own mouth. [sticks out tongue] Ahhhh...
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to the kitchen. A bowl of cereal is being made. Marco holds up a spoonful to Naysaya.''
|-
!Naysaya
|[panics] Will... will... will it hurt?
|-
!Marco
|Just make sure you chew with your teeth.
|-
!
|''Naysaya eats the spoonful.''
|-
!Naysaya
|Some more.
|-
!
|''Marco feeds Naysaya another spoonful.''
|-
!Naysaya
|Some more.
|-
!
|''Marco feeds Naysaya yet another spoonful; Naysaya's mouth is really getting full now.''
|-
!Naysaya
|Some more!
|-
!
|''Marco cleans milk off of Naysaya's mouth.''
|-
!Marco
|Okay, so you promise to keep your mouth shut, right?
|-
!Naysaya
|[swallows, sighs] Naysaya is in your corner.
|-
!
|''The scene changes to Echo Creek Academy. Marco watches Jackie from a distance.''
|-
!Jackie
|[talking to [[Hope Hadley]] and Lynn] That is so cute, you guys.
|-
!
|''Marco wraps a scarf around Naysaya, sighs, and approaches Jackie.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey, Jackie.
|-
!Janna
|Look. Is that Marco?
|-
!Star
|[gasps] He's going for it!
|-
!Jackie
|Hey, Marco. Wha... Are you cold? What's going on here with the scarf?
|-
!Marco
|Oh, you know, sometimes I... ski... to school.
|-
!Jackie
|No way! I snowboard! Awesome.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, yeah. There's probably a lot of stuff you don't know about me. That's why I thought it would be cool if we, uh... if we... if you and I... if we went on a—
|-
!Naysaya
|Oh-oh-oh, ''this'' is the Jacqueline Marco practiced asking out in the mirror. Oh! Marco even pretend-kissed you with his own... reflection.
|-
!Marco
|Naysaya, you promised you wouldn't do that!
|-
!Naysaya
|Wha... What's a promise?
|-
!Jackie
|Look, I gotta go home. You're... you're really confusing me.
|-
!
|''Jackie gets on her skate board and starts skating away.''
|-
!Marco
|Jackie, wait! It's not me saying this stuff! [unwraps scarf] It's him!
|-
!Students
|[gasps]
|-
!Naysaya
|Greetings, Jacqueline.
|-
!Jackie
|[gasps]
|-
!Carrie
|That is disgusting.
|-
![[Sabrina Backintosh]]
|Is that a British accent?
|-
!Marco
|Jackie, there's nothing I can do. [sighs] Got this curse thing on my neck. But I'd still like to ask—
|-
!Naysaya
|Marco hasn't taken a bath since he saw that shark movie!
|-
!Marco
|Ugh. He's right. I haven't taken a bath since I saw that shark movie. I mean, I take showers. I'm just... afraid of the tub.
|-
!Naysaya
|Oh, oh, oh! And Marco wears—
|-
!Marco
|I wear ballet shoes around the house.
|-
!Naysaya
|And he never held hands—
|-
!Marco
|I never held hands with a girl. So I practiced with [[Ferguson O'durguson|Ferguson]].
|-
!Naysaya
|And, and, and—
|-
!Marco
|I always sit when I go to the bathroom. What? Come on, there's ladies in the house. I cry when it rains. I-I still got my wubbie, and his name is Esteban. Until last week, I thought that the state of mind was between Nebraska and Kansas. I'm a straight-A student, and I've still got no idea how to do long division. Go ahead! Someone yell out a division!
|-
!Student
|Uh, 724 divided by 37?
|-
!Marco
|I got no idea. Get a calculator!
|-
!Naysaya
|Yes, but-but Marco also—
|-
!Marco
|I filled a notebook with my first name and your last name because I couldn't decide which looked better – "Marco Diaz Lynn Thomas" or "Marco Lynn Thomas Diaz".
|-
!Naysaya
|Oh, oh!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, yeah, and another thing. [holds up a piece of paper] I kept this drawing you made of the moon. I pulled it out of the trash in art class.
|-
!Jackie
|That's supposed to be a watermelon.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, really? Looks like a moon. Well, your watermelon reminds me of my biggest fear of all: that we're all alone on this tiny blue marble, floating in the infinite expanse of the universe, ripped from the center, and ejected out into a black void for no reason at all. Players on the stage of the absurd.
|-
!Jackie
|Wow, that was really... deep.
|-
!Marco
|So there it is, Jackie Lynn. That's it. That's all my insecurities. You know everything now. Unless I left anything out.
|-
!Naysaya
|...No, Marco, that's... everything.
|-
!Marco
|I still think it'd be really great if we hung out Friday night.
|-
!Star
|[laughing excitedly]
|-
!Jackie
|You know, a group of us are all going to a movie Friday night. You should totally come.
|-
!Marco
|That would be awesome.
|-
!Jackie
|Cool. Well, see you then. [skateboards away]
|-
!
|''Star tackles Marco.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah!
|-
!Star
|You did it, you did it, you did it, you did it, you did it, you did it!
|-
!Janna
|You know who to call when you get divorced, Marco.
|-
!Marco
|So, curse fulfilled right? How's this work? You just kinda dry up, flake off?
|-
!Naysaya
|You know, Naysaya has never been to the movies.
|-
!Marco
|[sighs]
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the movie theater; Marco and Jackie sit next to each other.''
|-
!Naysaya
|[eating popcorn, whispers] Don't open the door! It's not the milkman!
|-
!
|''An evil laugh bellows, following by a scream of terror.''
|-
!Audience
|[gasps]
|-
!Jackie
|[grabs Marco's arm, scared] That's not milk!
|-
!Naysaya
|Oh! Marco's very nervous right now.
|-
!
|''Marco shoves a piece of popcorn into Naysaya's mouth.''
|-
!Marco
|After the movie, you gotta go.
