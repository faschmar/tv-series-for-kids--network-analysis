|-
!Marco
| Star? Huh? [notices his locker] I don't know my combination!
|-
!
|''The lock rattles to the point of breaking, and the locker opens to reveal another version of Marco inside''
|-
!Marco
| [gasps] I'm... I'm... I'm wearing a suit!
|-

|''Out of sight, the alternate version of Marco turns into Mr. Candle. ''
|-
![[Mr. Candle]]
| What are your plans for the future, Mr. Diaz?
|-
!Marco
| Mr. Candle?

|''Various students from Echo Creek Academy appear on balloons which float up to the moon. ''
|-
![[Jackie Lynn Thomas]]
| We're moving on with our lives.
|-
!Marco
| But I haven't made up my balloon yet.

|''A red belt appears suspended in the sky above Marco''
|-
!Marco
| My red belt. I've been looking all over for you. [the belt flies away] Wait! Come back.
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
| Marco. Marco. Marco!
|-

|''Marco awakes from his dream. Star is in his room, leaning out of a dimensional scissors portal.''
|-
!Star
| Marco, Marco, Marco.
|-
!Marco
| [screams] Star?
|-
!Star
| You okay? Sounded like you were having one of those "stuck in life" dreams again.
|-
!Marco
| Yeah. Wait. What are you doing in here?
|-
!Star
| I'm hanging my first "Love Sentence" poster. You can be my prisoner of love, Justin Towers.
|-
!Marco
| Uh... that's not what I meant. I was sleeping.
|-
!Star
| Oh! Right. You have a hammer? I'm putting this bad boy up Earth girl style. No majack!
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, all I'm saying is, you could've tried knocking on my door, Earth girl style.
|-
!Star
| Why would I do that when I have dimensional... oh! How can I be so "duh"? Nothing's easy on Earth! [laughs] I'm gonna find a hammer the hard way. Scavenger hunt!
|-
!Marco
| Do we even have a hammer? [Marco stares at his karate gi]
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the Echo Creek Dojo''
|-
!Marco
| Sensei, I need to talk to you about graduating to a red...
|-
![[Sensei Brantley]]
| Silence! I'm about to achieve oneness with the universe. [inhales loudly, unintelligible muttering and grunting] Now, bow to your sensei.
|-
!Marco
| [bows] Master, I've been a green belt for five years. It's time for me to level up.
|-
!Sensei
| [laughs] Five years, and you think you're ready? Go get an ice cream cone or something and quit wasting my Saturday.
|-
!Marco
| Sensei, I'm serious.
|-
!Sensei
| Are you sure? The training you desire has broken many a student.
|-
!Marco
| I'm ready to do whatever it takes.
|-
!Sensei
| Fine. We start... [screaming] now! [kicks up his foot] Clip the toenail.
|-
!Marco
| Seriously?
|-
!Sensei
| Clip the toenail!!
|-
!Marco
| [starts clipping, nail hits his eye] Ow!
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the bathroom''
|-
!Sensei
| Plunge the toilet.
|-
!Marco
| Ugh.
|-
!
|''Scene changes back to the dojo floor''
|-
!Sensei
| Take the deduction.
|-
!Marco
| [fly lands on his eye, winces]
|-
!Sensei
| Is your moment of failure at hand, Mr. Diaz?
|-
!Marco
| [painfully] No sensei. Bleh.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the Diaz's home''
|-
!Star
| Hey guys! Just ignore me.
|-
![[Angie Diaz]]
| Why exactly are we ignoring you?
|-
!Star
| I'm scavenging the house for a hammer. Just pretend I'm not here.
|-
![[Rafael Diaz]]
| Okie-dokie.
|-
!Angie
| [to Rafael] Do we even have a hammer?
|-
!Rafael
| No.
|-
!Star
| [groans] If was a hammer... I'd be up there! [climbs the chimney]
|-
!Angie
| [to Rafael] We have to do something.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Marco. ''
|-
!Sensei
| That's right, Mr. Diaz. Feel the squeegee deep in your soul. Preparation is key; you never know when trouble will arrive
|-
!Sensei's mom
| [honks horn, steps out of car] Hello dear.
|-
!Sensei
| Mom! How nice to have you, uh, visit me at my own house.
|-
!Sensei's mom
| It's nice to see you finally getting to those windows, and you have a little friend helping you. Maybe I'll fix you a big helper's snack.
|-
!Marco
| Your mom seems nice.
|-
!Sensei
| Oh yes, she often comes to see me. But not too often, on account of her having her own home.
|-
!Marco
| I'm glad you made that distinction because it almost seemed like this was her house.
|-
!Sensei's mom
| Here you go boys [holds a plate of food]. If you need me, I'll be taking a nap in my room, okay?
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to the Sensei's room. ''
|-
!Marco
| Okay, it's clear that you live at home in a room that is unsettlingly similar to mine.
|-
!Sensei
| Uh... great. Then you'll have no problem cleaning it.
|-
!Marco
| Wait a minute. Are you training me for a red belt, or are you making me do all your chores?
|-
!Sensei
| No no, we're training. [Kicks out his leg] Ha! Cut the toenail.
|-
!Marco
| Ugh! I think I've more than earned my red belt.
|-
!Sensei
| Uh, you can't because I, uh... [starts sobbing] because I'm also only a green belt.
|-
!Marco
| What⁈
|-
!Sensei
| I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life so I rented a dojo and ordered these instructional videotapes. Each tape tole me what to learn to get each color belt. It was going pretty well at first, but I only watched as far as the green belt tape.
|-
!Marco
| Why'd you stop there?
|-
!Sensei
| Because the red belt tape got stuck in the machine. Now it just holds up the short leg on my computer table.
|-
!Marco
| Couldn't you just try to get the tape out and untangle it?
|-
!Sensei
| I did, but that tape got stuck in another machine! What kind of sensei can't even work a VCR?
|-
!Marco
| [breathes deeply] Well, we can totally find it online. [uses his cell phone] Except we can't. It seems like this is one of the rarest sets of videotapes in existence. I guess we'll just have to find it IRL.
|-
!Sensei
| No way. I owe those guys too much in back taxes.
|-
!Marco
| IRL means 'in real life.' We just have to find a copy somewhere out there.
|-
!Sensei
| I see. In that case, we'll need wheels.
|-
!
|''Outside the house''
|-
!Sensei
| [riding bicycle with Marco] To adventure!
|-
!Marco
| [laughing] Feel the wind in my tassels!
|-
!Dog
| [barks]
|-
!Sensei
| Mom, call Rocket. He's being weird.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Star, who's still searching for the hammer. The Diaz's house is a total mess!''
|-
!Star
| [groans while crawling] Must... find... hammer. [head smacks against ground]
|-
!
|''Scene changes to outside thrift store''
|-
!Sensei
| What is this place?
|-
!Marco
| It's cool. You'll love it.
|-
!Sensei
| [inside the store] Yuck. Come on. It's like a yard sale, but inside.
|-
!Marco
| These are the only kind of places you can find old videotapes anymore. [grabs a cassette]
|-
!Sensei
| Is that it?
|-
!Marco
| No [grabs another].
|-
!Sensei
| Is that it?
|-
!Marco
| No [grabs another].
|-
!Sensei
| Is that it?
|-
!Marco
| Nope [grabs another].
|-
!Sensei
| Is that?
|-
!Marco
| Nope [grabs another]. Got it. Never mind, this is how to karaoke.
|-
!Sensei
| Ahg. This is impossible! We're never gonna find it.
|-
!Marco
| Come on, we just got here. [store bell rings] Why don't you go check one of those other bookcases? Sensei?
|-
!
|''Outside the store''
|-
!Sensei
| How about grape and cherry? Ooh, you know what? Just squirt every flavor you got on it zombie style. [receives an ice cream cone] Ooh, yeah.
|-
!Marco
| Why'd you leave?
|-
!Sensei
| Got some cash? I don't get my allowance till Friday.
|-
!Marco
| Oh, uh... here.
|-
!
|''Marco's sensei has vanished, but the ice cream man points Marco in the right direction. He is currently showing off a bicycle trick to two ladies.''
|-
!Sensei
| Fifty one, fifty two, fifty three...
|-
!Marco
| Sensei, what are you doing?
|-
!Sensei
| Dude, these chicks totally dig my bike.
|-
!Marco
| Are you for real?
|-
!Sensei
| What?
|-
!Marco
| You don't really wanna earn your red belt, do you?
|-
!Sensei
| Look, we tried, and we failed, and that's okay.
|-
!Marco
| It's not okay. I actually wanted to be like you, but you're just like me, except I'm not gonna end up 38 years old and still living with my parents. I'll see you later
|-
!Sensei
| Where you going?
|-
!Marco
| I'm going to find that tape and get my red belt.
|-
!Sensei
| Uh, bow to your sensei.
|-
!Marco
| I don't have a sensei anymore. [to himself] So where am I gonna look next? I could check more thrift stores, but what are the odds I'll [walks in to a billboard] Ow. [the billboard reads 'Rare video Tapes'] Bump into it? [looks up and reads the store name 'VHS Depot'].
|-
!
|''inside''
|-
!Cashier
| You are no cinephile. Next.
|-
!Marco
| I'm looking for a rare set of karate instructional tapes.
|-
!Cashier
| Finally. A customer who knows what he's talking about.
|-
!Marco
| It's the "How to Karate" series. The red belt tape.
|-
!Cashier
| [gestures] Behold, the coveted volume 8 red belt cassette. [pulls it from the shelf] Viewed only once.
|-
!Marco
| [sighs] I've been looking all over for you [reaches to pick it up]
|-
!Cashier
| [smacks Marco's hand] Not without gloves, please.
|-
!Marco
| Okay. How much is it?
|-
!Cashier
| I will give you the aficionado price. 2,400.
|-
!Marco
| Dollars⁈ [laughs] I can't afford that.
|-
!Cashier
| Well, there is another way. Fight me for it.
|-
!Marco
| Really? Yeah, okay.
|-
!
|''The cashier stands up, revealing his tall height and his muscular body. ''
|-
!Marco
| [unintimidated] I'm not leaving without that tape.
|-
!
|''The cashier karate chops his own desk, and the battle begins. Marco's old sensei walks in.''
|-
!Sensei
| Hey, Marco. I'm still your sensei, right? Ooh.
|-
!
|''The fighting continues, Marco is losing. ''
|-
!Marco
| Sensei, he has the tape [screams]
|-
!Sensei
| Mr. Diaz, clip the toenail!
|-
!
|''Marco does as he says, and the cashier falls to the ground.''
|-
!Cashier
| You... defeated me. [smiling] The tape is yours [hands it over].
|-
!Sensei
| [in a loop of magnetic tape] Can you ask him if he has the "How to Untangle Multiple VHS Tapes" VHS tape?
|-
!Marco
| No. Do you have a pair of scissors?
|-
!Cashier
| Actually, we...
|-
!Marco
| Not the critically acclaimed award-winning romantic comedy "A Pair of Scissors," an actual pair of scissors.
|-
!Cashier
| No.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to star. She's being licked by her laser puppies''
|-
!Star
| It's okay guys. I'm done. Go on without me. [clattering] A hammer!
|-
!Rafael and Angie
| [sigh]
|-
!Star
| Now I just need to find some nails.
|-
!Rafael
| [whispering] Back to the store.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to the dojo. The "How To Karate" tape ejects from the VHS player.''
|-
!Sensei
| You know, red is really your color [bows].
|-
!Marco
| It's yours too, sensei [bows].
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Star in her room.''
|-
!Star
| I'd say this Earth girl did a job well done. [part of the wall's paint flakes off] Now, let's clean this house the easy way.
