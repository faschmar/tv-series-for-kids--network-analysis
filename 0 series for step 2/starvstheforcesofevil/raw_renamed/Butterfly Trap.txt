|''Episode begins at the Bureaucracy of Magic; the sound of a gavel is heard. In a courtroom,[[Rhombulus]], [[Hekapoo]], and [[Omnitraxus Prime]] sit behind the judges' chairs, and [[Eclipsa Butterfly]] stands behind the defendant podium with her hands handcuffed.''
|-
![[Omnitraxus Prime]]
|All rise! The court of the [[Magic High Commission|Magical High Commission]] is now in session. Her Majesty, [[Queen Butterfly|Queen Moon]] of [[Mewni]], presiding.
|-
!
|''[[Queen Butterfly|Queen Moon]] appears behind Omnitraxus and stands in front of the judge's chair in the middle.''
|-
![[Queen Butterfly|Queen Moon]]
|Thank you. We are gathered here today for the trial of Eclipsa—
|-
![[Sean]]
|[bursts in with a typewriter] I'm sorry! [courtroom door briefly closes on him] I-I'm sorry I'm late! [panting] We haven't had a trial in so long, I didn't know where to find the typey thingy. Usually Rhombulus just crystallizes everybody. [laughs] With his laser eye. But a real trial! This is exciting!
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]
|That depends on where you're sitting.
|-
!Moon
|As I was saying, we're gather here today for the trial of Eclipsa.
|-
!
|''As Moon speaks, Sean types loudly over her.''
|-
!Sean
|[stops typing]
|-
!Moon
|[growls]
|-
!Sean
|[types slowly and softly]
|-
!Moon
|We shall determine once and for all whether Eclipsa has committed the evil deeds recorded in our histories. If she is found guilty, the punishment will be—
|-
![[Rhombulus]]
|Death! Death!
|-
!Moon
|Rhombulus, we talked about this!
|-
!Rhombulus
|Well, we crystallized her last time. Look how that turned out. Death!
|-
!Moon
|Hey! Sit down.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Yes, ma'am...
|-
![[Hekapoo]]
|Well, that's all in order. But what is ''she'' doing here?
|-
!
|''Hekapoo reveals [[Star Butterfly]] sitting behind her.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|This is supposed to be a ''private'' hearing!
|-
!Moon
|Star was the one who convinced me to hold this trial in the first place. If Eclipsa is found guilty, I want her to be here to see it.
|-
![[Star Butterfly|Star]]
|Or if she's innocent — which she is — I wanna see all y'all's faces when you realize how wrong you were.
|-
!Hekapoo
|If you think you can just waltz in here and run your mouth off—!
|-
!Star
|[simultaneously] I can waltz wherever I want! I can run my mouth when I want!
|-
!Rhombulus
|[simultaneously] Death! Death!
|-
!Moon
|[simultaneously] No! I will hold you in contempt of court! Sit down!
|-
!Sean
|[interrupting everyone] Excuse me! Hey, sorry, but could you talk a bit slower, please?
|-
!Moon
|[whispering angrily] No.
|-
!Sean
|[types "NO" on the typewriter]
|-
!Omnitraxus
|Queen Moon, what evidence have you brought us?
|-
!Moon
|I'm afraid this is the evidence.
|-
!
|''Moon produces a large stack of papers, binders, stone tables, and scrolls.''
|-
!Moon
|It's less impressive than it looks. These are all second-hand accounts, oral histories, folk stories, none of them verified.
|-
!Hekapoo
|There's no way around it. Come on, everybody grab a stack.
|-
!Star
|You guys aren't gonna seriously sit here and read all of that?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Yes, I don't mean to fuss, but exactly how long is this trial meant to last?
|-
!Moon
|[sighs] As long as it takes. Now to begin, we must organize each and every one of these documents by date and author.
|-
!Rhombulus
|[groans] Sounds like math!
|-
!Moon
|Once we've constructed a rough timeline, we can—
|-
!Eclipsa
|Uh, that won't be necessary. I request a Trial by Box.
|-
!Rhombulus
|[tosses papers] Awesome!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Well, it looks like I won't be needing these anymore.
|-
!Omnitraxus
|Sean, cancel my lunch order. We're gonna be done here pretty quick.
|-
!Sean
|[stops typing] Lunch?
|-
!Moon
|Eclipsa, are you sure about this? The Box is a ruthless seeker of truth. If you attempt to conceal anything from it, crystallization may be the least of your worries.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I'm tired of sitting around waiting for you to decide my fate. I'll give you the truth. All of it. And if that means crystallization, so be it.
|-
!Moon
|Sean, we wish to invoke Trial by Box.
|-
!Sean
|[salutes] Yes, your Majesty!
|-
!
|''Sean runs out of the courtroom and returns with an ornamental cart with a banner that reads "BOX OF TRUTH".''
|-
!Sean
|The Box of Truth has arrived!
|-
!
|''Sean pulls on a rope cord, and the banner pulls up to reveal the [[Truth or Punishments]] box.''
|-
!Star
|Wait, is that Truth or Punishment?
|-
!Moon
|What? No, no, no, no. This is the Box of Truth.
|-
!Star
|That, my friend, is Truth or Punishment. We played it at my sleepover.
|-
!Moon
|You played it?! The Box is not a game!
|-
!Box
|[intense male voice] Who do you have a crush on? 
|-
!Rhombulus
|[stammers] Queen Moon! Uh-oh.
|-
!
|''Moon, Star, Hekapoo, and Omnitraxus stare at Rhombulus as he blushes.''
|-
!Moon
|[sighs] It must be on the wrong setting.
|-
!
|''Moon picks up the Box and turns it over, showing a display that reads "PARTY" and a dial.'' 
|-
!Moon
|[turns dial to "INTERVENTION"]
|-
!Box
|We need to talk.
|-
!Moon
|[turns dial to "BACHELORETTE"]
|-
!Box
|All right, ladies! Are you—?
|-
!Moon
|[turns dial to "TRIAL"]
|-
!Box
|Prepare for judgment!
|-
!Moon
|The rules are simple. Each member of the Magical High Commission shall ask one question, and the accused must answer. [turns the box on]
|-
!Box
|To all who seek the path of knowledge, listen well to this decree. Surrender to the eye
of justice. Swear an oath of truth to me.
|-
!
|''A small mouth rises out of the box.''
|-
!Star
|Ooh. Different poem, different poem.
|-
!Moon
|[sticks pinky finger in box's mouth] I swear.
|-
!Hekapoo
|[sticks pinky finger in box's mouth] I swear.
|-
!Omnitraxus
|I swear. [sticks index finger in box's mouth]
|-
!Rhombulus
|I, uh... swear? [sticks one of his snake heads' tongue in box mouth]
|-
!Eclipsa
|[sticks pinky finger in box's mouth] I swear.
|-
!Box
|And now, it's time for trial by Box.
|-
!
|''The box reconfigures to an eyeball shape and shines a spotlight on Eclipsa.''
|-
!Omnitraxus
|Eclipsa, did you write the evil chapter in the [[Magic Instruction Book|Book of Spells]]?
|-
!Box
|Exhibit A! [creates hologram of the Book of Spells]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Yes, I did. But for the record, I never called it the evil chapter. That was your people's name for it. [unlocks her chapter and flips pages containing her spells] I wrote plenty of eviler spells that never even made it into the final draft. Writing is rewriting, you know.
|-
!Box
|[turns green] Truth!
|-
!
|''On a "GOOD/EVIL" checklist, Hekapoo makes a checkmark under "EVIL".''
|-
!Star
|[scoffs] Whatever. Have you guys even read her chapter?
|-
!Moon
|Hekapoo, the second question goes to you.
|-
!Hekapoo
|Box, pull up the royal archives for me, would ya?
|-
!Box
|Exhibit B. [creates hologram of Eclipsa and [[King Shastacan]]]
|-
!
|''Eclipsa stares at a hologram of King Shastacan making a disgusted grimace, crossing her arms and looks away.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Did you abandon your husband, King Shastacan, and your kingdom to elope with a monster?
|-
!
|''The hologram version of Eclipsa runs away from King Shastacan and goes up to a hologram of [[Globgor]].''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[blushes] Oh, hello, sweetie. Yes, I did run off with a monster. But could you really blame me? How could I resist a smile like that? [carressing Globgor's check with her finger as Globgor growls contentedly] 
|-
!Box
|[turns green] Truth again!
|-
!Star
|Aww! Huh?
|-
!Hekapoo
|[checks off "EVIL" again] Uh-huh.
|-
!Star
|Come on, Eclipsa.
|-
!Moon
|Rhombulus, the third—
|-
!Rhombulus
|Did you eat those babies?!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[blinks her eyes and tilts her head in confusion] ...What?
|-
!Hekapoo
|Ugh! Bobipsa was the baby-eater, not Eclipsa!
|-
!Rhombulus
|Oh, right. I wanna take my question back.
|-
!Box
|There are no take-backs in trial by Box! [creates hologram of Eclipsa tormenting babies]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, I hate to disappoint you, but I'm afraid I have not eaten even a single baby. Now, I did hurt the occasional teenager, but only psychologically, and they always deserved it.
|-
!Box
|[turns green] We're on a roll here, people!
|-
!
|''Hekapoo checks off "EVIL" once again.''
|-
!Star
|What is wrong with—?! Didn't you hear her?! She didn't eat those babies!
|-
!Moon
|Star, sit down. We must respect the rules of the Box.
|-
!Star
|Fine! [returns to her seat]
|-
!Moon
|[stands up] Eclipsa... Are you sorry for what you've done?
|-
!Eclipsa
|...No. I'm not.
|-
!Hekapoo
|What?!
|-
!Omnitraxus
|The nerve! Outrageous!
|-
!
|''Hekapoo writes "EVIL" in big, red letters on a scroll and shows it Eclipsa.''
|-
!Omnitraxus
|That settles it. Rhombulus, if you would.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Right. [charges his crystal gem]
|-
!Eclipsa
|One moment. I haven't asked ''my'' question.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Wait. What?
|-
!Hekapoo
|[laughs]
|-
!Omnitraxus
|She can't ask us a question.
|-
!Star
|Um... I think she can! Right, Mom? [stammers] My mom said! She said in the rules!
|-
!Moon
|Technically, since Eclipsa was once a queen of Mewni, she is still a member of the Magical High Commission. And every member gets to ask one question.
|-
!Eclipsa
|[clears throat] What did you do with my daughter?
|-
!
|''The Box of Truth shines a spotlight on the Magic High Commission.''
|-
!Magic High Commission
|[gasps]
|-
!Hekapoo
|Uh, I have no idea what she's talking about.
|-
!Omnitraxus
|We didn't do anything with your daughter!
|-
!Rhombulus
|And honestly? I-I'm kind of offended.
|-
!Box
|[turns red] Too bad for you. [bellowing] Everyone lied!
|-
!
|''The Box traps everyone in a giant metal box.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|What's happening? We told the truth!
|-
!Box
|Are you sure about that?
|-
!
|''The giant box shrinks slightly.''
|-
!All
|[gasps]
|-
!Star
|Uh, c'mon, guys, spit it out!
|-
!Hekapoo
|We didn't do anything wrong!
|-
!
|''The giant box shrinks again.''
|-
!Moon
|The Box seems to differ!
|-
!Omnitraxus
|We aren't the ones on trial!
|-
!Box
|If you'd rather get to the truth more quickly, I can work with that.
|-
!
|''The giant box starts shrinking steadily.''
|-
!All
|[gasps]
|-
!Rhombulus
|That's not good.
|-
!Star
|[pushing against wall] Guys!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa glares intensely at the Magic High Commission.''
|-
!Omnitraxus
|[pushing against wall, grunts] My magic's no good in here!
|-
!
|''Rhombulus creates tall crystal pillars to keep the box from shrinking. Hekapoo creates several clones of herself to push against the walls.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|[grunting]
|-
!Omnitraxus
|Moon, please shut it off!
|-
!Moon
|I can't do that. We all took the oath!
|-
!
|''Rhombulus' crystal pillars start to break.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|Oh, no. Okay, I'm done! I want out!
|-
!
|''Hekapoo's clones poof into thin air.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|We're gonna be crushed!
|-
!Star
|You know, this is so unfair! You enforce the laws of magic on everyone around you, and yet for some reason, ''you'' can lie to ''us''? How does that make you any different than the villain you say Eclipsa is?!
|-
!Rhombulus
|...We got rid of your daughter, sorry!
|-
!Box
|[turns green] Truth!
|-
!
|''The giant box disappears, and everyone returns to their original positions in the courtroom.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|[groans]
|-
!Hekapoo
|What the heck, Rhombulus?!
|-
!Rhombulus
|I'm sorry, I'm tired of keeping it a secret. Tell 'em Omni.
|-
!Omnitraxus
|[sighs] Fine. Eclipsa, your ex-husband, King Shastacan...
|-
!
|''Omnitraxus' explanation is accompanied by holograms from the Box of Truth.''
|-
!Omnitraxus
|He wanted nothing to do with your half-monster daughter. So we swapped her out with a [[Festivia Butterfly|peasant girl]]. We gave her the [[Royal Magic Wand|royal magic wand]], and she became the next queen of Mewni.
|-
!Box
|Eclipsa has been found guilty of crimes against Mewmanity. However, the Magical High Commission has also been found guilty of tampering with Mewni's history and omitting the truth from the [[Butterfly family]] for generations. This concludes the trial. Although, if we're all being honest here, it seems like y'all still have some issues to deal with.
|-
!
|''The Box of Truth deactivates and falls into Moon's hands.''
|-
!Moon
|...So it was just as we suspected.
|-
!Hekapoo and Omni
|What?!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Uh, Moon?
|-
!
|''Moon gets out of her chair and walks up to Eclipsa's podium.''
|-
!Moon
|We knew there was something missing from our family's history. Eclipsa's daughter should be recorded here in the royal archives, but she's gone.
|-
!Rhombulus
|[gasps] Wait a minute. This whole trial was a set-up?!
|-
!Sean
|[panicked whimpering]
|-
!Hekapoo
|You were planning this all along!
|-
!Star
|Actually... we ''all'' planned this.
|-
!Sean
|[more panicked whimpering]
|-
!Moon
|We thought you might be hiding something. And it turns out we were right!
|-
!Star
|You lied to our family for generations!
|-
!Sean
|[mouth hanging open, banging on typewriter keys]
|-
!Hekapoo
|We had to!
|-
!Omnitraxus
|Can you imagine if the power of magic fell into the hands of a monster?
|-
!Star
|You let us live a lie. We shouldn't even have the throne. Eclipsa isn't even— Wait. [turns to Eclipsa] You aren't actually my great-great-great-great-something-grandma.
|-
!Eclipsa
|No, sweetie, I'm not.
|-
!Star
|Then... that means... [takes out her wand and holds it] we're no more royal than anybody else.
|-
!Moon
|You're still a princess, Star.
|-
!Star
|No, Mom. [pauses before looking at Eclipsa] We're nobody.
|-
!
|''Star uses her wand to unlock Eclipsa's handcuffs, then walks away as Eclipsa, surprised, rubs her free wrists and watches Star leaving.''
|-
!Moon
|Star! Star, wait!
|-
!
|''Star runs out of the courtroom.''
