|''Scene opens at Britta's Tacos''
|-
!'''[[Marco Diaz]]'''
| [slurps drink] Huh. Authentic Mexican horchata isn't supposed to have dairy in it.
|-
!'''[[Star Butterfly]]'''
| So what? It isn't illegal to make horchatas with milk.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Are you sugaring your burrito?
|-
!'''Star'''
| Food is anarchy dude. Live by your own rules [takes a bite]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Ugh.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [holds out burrito] Want some?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Keep your sacrilege off my taco!
|-
!'''Star'''
| Mmm. [takes another bite] Whoo! Do I feel alive! [bounces up and down vigorously] You sure you don't want a bite?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Definitely sure.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Who's up for fireworks?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| I can't see how that'd be a good idea.
|-
!'''Star'''
| 'Cause I totally wanna make fireworks. Bright-Glow Pyro! Sparkling Spiral Noodle! Radical Rainbow Blast!! Rainbow Glitter Unicorn Gnome Hat Kitty Bacon Hawaiian Nightmare!
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Star, might wanna tone it down a notch.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [laughs]
|-
!
|''A firework blasts the giant Taco logo onto a police car, destroying it. ''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [gasps]
|-
!'''Star'''
| Ooh!
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [grabs Star and runs, panting] What the heck was that⁈ I thought rainbows were made of light.
|-
!'''Star'''
| My rainbows are made of stuff, okay?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Okay, okay, okay. You just smashed a police car. Oh man. This is fine, this is fine.
|-
!'''Star'''
| What's the big deal, Marco? I've done this a thousand times. I'll just have my dad give them some crowns. Call it even.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Things don't work like that on Earth. Here, you'll go to prison.
|-
!'''Star'''
| You mean like Saint O's?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| It's worse than Saint O's. They give you one bar of soap, and you have to make it last a whole year. You gotta get up every day at 4:00 A.M. and make hash browns you're not allowed to eat. And they force you to wear orange jumpsuits every single day.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Orange⁈ [peeks around the corner]
|-
!'''Female Officer'''
| Ai. I don't know. You tell me.
|-
!'''Star'''
| They noticed the dent.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| I guess I could visit you in prison or whatever.
|-
!'''Star'''
| There's only one thing left for me to do. I'm gonna run away.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Wait, wait, wait. No, that's not... running is worse.
|-
!'''Star'''
| You can't stop me, rule boy [takes off].
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Star, wait.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [turns around] I'll contact you when I find a place to lay low [runs].
|-
!
|''Star turns a corner and runs into two police officers off duty.''
|-
!'''Officer'''
| Look, if you can't read, you can't do a crossword.
|-
!
|''Star turns around, runs to a fence labeled "No Trespassing," and jumps it, landing in some bushes.''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Whoa!!
|-
!
|''Her momentum causes her to tumble down to the side of a canal below.''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh! No one'll find me here. Okay, first day in hiding. Where to start? Shelter [puts her hands together]
|-
!
|''A castle appears out of a cloud of purple smoke''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Okay, maybe something less conspicuous.
|-
!
|''She dismantles the castle and starts gathering materials from the canal in to a shelter.''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
|-
!
|''It fall apart on top of her immediately.''
|-
!
|''Sometime later, Star grabs a bush for shelter instead.''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Heh. Good enough.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to that night, Star shivers despite having a small fire. She wakes up that morning because of a bird poking its beak at her; there's more than one.''
|-
!'''Bird'''
| [squawks]
|-
!'''Star'''
| [screams]
|-
!'''Bird'''
| [squawks]
|-
!'''[[Brigid]]'''
| Well, what are you doing down here, sunshine?
|-
!'''Star'''
| Uh, nothin'. Just takin' a stroll. [Her stomach growls and she hides her hands behind her back]
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Well, sounds like someone's hungry. I'm about to make some pancakes if you'd like to join.
|-
!'''Star'''
| I do like pancakes.
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Well then, my house is right through hair.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Wait a second. Did you just say hair?
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Of course not, my dear.
|-
!'''Bird'''
| [squawks]
|-
!'''Star'''
| [stares at Brigid] Okay. Mm, pancakes.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to inside Brigid's home.''
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Welcome to 80 square feet of my own personal paradise.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh, your home is so cozy. [looks at a tapestry on the wall] A radical tapestry.
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Would you like one pancake or two?
|-
!'''Star'''
| Five please. [climbs up to Brigid's loft] Wow! Cool loft bed.
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Pancakes are ready.
|-
!
|''Star eagerly awaits her pancakes at the table''
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| So you gonna tell me what you did?
|-
!'''Star'''
| What do you mean?
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Oh, hon, come on. Folks don't come down to the river unless they broke some of the rules. Your secret's safe with me.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Well... okay. So, like, I was with Marco at Britta's Tacos, and we were eating, and he was all, like, "Star, you can't put sugar on your burrito." But what does he care, ya know? So then I ate the burrito and I wanted to see some fireworks. Again, he's like, "Star don't fireworks your burrito."
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| [stares at Star's hair/headband]
|-
!'''Star'''
| and it's all like, don't do this, don't do that. Hey. My eyes are down here.
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Oh. I'm sorry, dear. Go on and finish your story.
|-
!'''Star'''
| So anyway, my rainbow smashed a cop car. Jumped a fence and fell asleep in some garbage by the river, and now I'm here. So... what did you do?
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Oh, you know, I steal hair.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [grabs her bangs] Oh, why would you do that?
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Oh, no, no, no, sweetie. It's not like that. I don't take hair from people. No, no, no. It's more of like a back-alley kind of thing. You know, dumpsters, behind hair salons, dog kennels, discarded hair.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [still holding her hair] So you do, like, witchy stuff with the hair, right? Is that what this is? You some kind of witch?
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Oh, goodness no, dear. You can do lots of things with hair. I wove it into that tapestry you like so much. Stuff your bed with it. Heck, you can even make pancake batter from it.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [stares horridly]
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| [laughs] I'm just playin' with you. But seriously, my favorite thing to do with the hair is to weave it into nests for all my wounded forest friends [opens window to show Star]
|-
!'''Star'''
| Aww!
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| You can make anything from hair. Well, anything... but love. [holds up a 'Missing' poster of Star] Star, your family loves you. Let's call them and tell them you're okay.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh no no no. You don't have to do that. Just let me stay here with you. See, I can sleep anywhere. Look [goes under table, snores].
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| But this is no life for a little girl. Let me help you.
|-
!'''Star'''
| No thank you [runs]
|-
!'''Brigid'''
| Star! Wait. Come back. [picks up a tomato can] Hello. Operator.
|-
!'''Man'''
| Whoa, whoa, stop. Stop right there.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Aah.
|-
!'''Man'''
| I said stop [his dog barks]
|-
!'''Star'''
| [jumps into river]
|-
!'''Man'''
| Who's walkin' who here?
|-
!
|''Star continues to swim deeper into the river. She forms a bubble around her with her magic.''
|-
!'''Star'''
| [gasps, yawns, falls asleep]
|-
!
|''Later, someone knocks on her bubble.''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Whoa.
|-
!'''Sea Serpent'''
| Excuse me.
|-
!'''Star'''
| What is going on?
|-
!'''Sea Serpent'''
| I'm fishing, hamster pats. What does it look like? No go on. Hidin' out here; you're gonna blow my cover.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Whoa, you too? I too am hiding out, too.
|-
!'''Sea Serpent'''
| Why didn't you say so? You've come to the perfect place.

|-
!'''Star'''
| But he'll be so worried.
|-
!'''Sea Serpent'''
| No, no, no, you're hiding out; you gotta lay low.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Lay low?
|-
!'''Sea Serpent'''
| Yeah. You're on the lam. You can do whatever you want down here so long as you never see your family and friends again.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Huh? Never ever?
|-
!'''Sea Serpent'''
| Not even a bit.
|-
!'''Star'''
| So I'd have to spend the rest of my life here with just you?
|-
!'''Sea Serpent'''
| [scoffs] Don't be ridiculous. I'm not real. I'm just your brain trying to convince you you haven't made a big mistake.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh no. So I wrote that song?
|-
!'''Sea Serpent'''
| Enjoy the inside of your mind [eats himself]
|-
!
|''Star decides to surface. It's night.''
|-
!'''Star'''
| bleh-bleh-bleh.
|-
!'''Male Officer'''
| See anything? What's over there?
|-
!'''Female Officer'''
| Are those footprints?
|-
!
|''Star puts on her devil horns headband and crawls out to shore.''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Okay, I surrender. [grabs officer] Just lock me up and put me in orange. Seeing Marco once a month is better than never again.
|-
!
|''At the Police Station''
|-
!'''Male Officer'''
| Marco. You mean him? [gestures to Marco]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [wakes up] Star? You're okay! [hugs Star] We were so worried. How'd you find her?
|-
!'''Male Officer'''
| [holding an empty corn can] We have our ways. You know, you shouldn't run away like that. You really worried your friend here. Lucky for you, we were gonna smash that old squad car anyway.
|-
!'''Star'''

|-
!'''Female Officer'''

|-
!'''Male Officer'''
| I was really looking forward to smashing it.
|-
!'''Star'''

|-
!'''Marco'''
| Star, isn't that what got you into this mess in the first place?
