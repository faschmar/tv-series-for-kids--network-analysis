|''Scene opens in a desert. Star, Marco, and Pony Head are together.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz|Marco]] Diaz
| Uh, next.
|-
!Pony Head
|Where are you going? I thought you wanted a goblin dog, right?
|-
!Marco
|Do you see the goblin dog truck?
|-
!Pony Head
|This is the place. I am positive.
|-
!Marco
|But you've been saying that for the last 12 dimensions, and I'm hungry. I'm gonna go home and make a sandwich.
|-
![[Star Butterfly|Star]] Butterfly
| Guys guys guys! I found it. [pointing] There it is. The goblin dog truck.
|-
!
|''They spy the truck, and a monstrously long line in front of it.''
|-
!Marco
|That line is like, a million miles long.
|-
!Pony Head
|It's all good. My friend Kelly's holding us a spot. Yo, Kelly!
|-
!
|''A green and fluffy monster pokes her head out of line.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, hey Kelly. Yo, Star! come stand by me girl. [shoves others to make room] Oh my goodness. B-fly, we got so much catching up to do. Let's start doing it. Not you Marco. [pushes Marco to Kelly] Okay. You can stand over here and talk to Kelly.
|-
!Marco
|Hey Kelly.
|-
!Kelly
|[blinks]
|-
!Marco
|Uh, have you been waiting long?
|-
!Kelly
|[blinks]
|-
!Pony Head
|That's so cute. You guys are basically like the same person.
|-
!Marco
|[hesitantly] Yeah, but, uh, are you sure you wanna wait in this crazy line for just a hot dog?
|-
!Koala
|It's not just a hot dog.
|-
!
|''A battle axe swings by Marco into a tree, barely missing his head.''
|-
!Koala
|It's a goblin dog. Some would kill for a goblin dog. Just like how I almost killed you with that axe. Just to be clear, I'm the one who threw that axe.
|-
!Tree
|I pulled myself out of the ground for a goblin dog. [points to roots] I'm a bit tender.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh please. I had a goblin dog just last week and it was teh bomb.
|-
!Koala
|Really?
|-
!Roy
|[singing] ♪ You might think this line is long. But listen to my goblin song. It's been hours since you ate but goblin dogs are worth the wait ♫ Yeah!
|-
!Marco
|What is happening?
|-
!Pony Head
|With Ms. Heinous gone, St. O's is like a total party school now.
|-
!Marco
|Did you guys see that little man playing the music? [laughing]
|-
!Pony Head
|Marco, you're ignoring Kelly. Rude.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, sorry. [to Kelly] Did you see that little man playing music?
|-
!Kelly
|[blinks]
|-
!Marco
|Okay.
|-
!
|''Sometime later''
|-
!Pony Head
|I gotta have a tall man, you know, 'cause I like to float, like, five feet off the ground, so it's like I'm 4'6" but with six inch heels, you know what I'm saying?
|-
!Marco
|Ugh. I mean, sometimes it feels like they're the kids and I'm the parent, you know?
|-
!Kelly
|[spits out an apple core]
|-
!Marco
|Whoa! You got another one of those? I'm starving.
|-
!Kelly
|[spits out an apple core]
|-
!Marco
|You gotta be kidding me.
|-
!
|''[Marco gets smacked in the face by a projectile]''
|-
!Marco
|What the...
|-
!Roy
|Alright, kiddies. You're just moments away from maximum mouth-ertainment. So stay cool in a hot goblin dog T-shirt.
|-
!Monster 1
|[jumping] Me, me!
|-
!Monster 2
|In my mouth! I want it in my mouth!
|-
!Marco
|Excuse me.
|-
!Roy
|Hi.
|-
!Marco
|You work here?
|-
!Roy
|Yes.
|-
!Marco
|We've been waiting forever. How do we get a goblin dog?
|-
!Roy
|You wait in line.
|-
!Marco
|And can you tell me how to get in that short line over there? [points]
|-
!Roy
|Oh, that's the VIP line. It's my boss' idea.
|-
!Marco
|How do we get to the VIP line?
|-
!Roy
|Well, it's pretty exclusive but I could s-n-e-a-k you guys in.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, you know what? I'm gonna go with no, thank you.
|-
!Marco
|What? He just offered to sneak us in?
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, what? I thought he spelled something else. That's my bad.
|-
!Roy
|Welcome to the VIP line! [appears in merchandise wagon] Okay. Who's ready to buy some goblin dog products?
|-
!Star
|That's okay. We just want the hot dog.
|-
!Roy
|You're in the VIP line. That stands for... ̲Very ̲Interested in buying ̲Products. Buy the products, stay in the line. get the dogs.
|-
!Star
|I don't have any money.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, I think I got some. Check in my back pocket, girl.
|-
!Star
|[reaches inside Pony Head]
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, uh-uh. No, I think that's my keys.
|-
!Star
|Oh, I found it. Uh, 27 cents and two pistachio shells.
|-
!Marco
|I got some cash.
|-
!Star
|Marco, how much money is that?
|-
!Marco
|Like 650 bucks.
|-
!Roy
|Yep, that'll do it. [grabs money] This will get you the executive package.
|-
!Star
|[in goblin dog slippers] Man, this goblin dog stuff is ridiculous.
|-
!Pony Head
|Yeah, you dropped a ton of cash on all this swag.
|-
!Marco
|No, I got us into the right line.
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Oh my gosh. Look. We're next!
|-
!Roy
|[opens window]
|-
!Star
|Four goblin dogs please.
|-
!Roy
|Oh, you have to wait in that line now. [points to another monstrously long line]
|-
!Marco
|How many lines are there?
|-
!Roy
|Oh, it's all one line. There's just a lot of them, so after that line, you'll go to that line, then that line, then that line, then that line, then that line, then that line, then it hooks back like a dog's leg. Then you gotta take a number. You know, from a little number ticket pulley thingy.
|-
!Marco
|Okay, I'd like to speak to the manager please.
|-
!Roy
|Certainly sir. [closes window, opens it up now wearing a hat] Yes?
|-
!Marco
|What's the deal man? We waited six hours and bought all your stuff.
|-
!Roy
|I'm sorry sir, did you say you've been waiting for six hours?
|-
!Marco
|Yes.
|-
!Roy
|Well, some of these folks have been waiting years.
|-
!All
|[yelling] Years⁈
|-
!Roy
|[screaming] Years!! [closes window, reopens without his hat] So what did my manager say?
|-
!All
|You're the manager!
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, you know what? Forget this okay? I'm not waiting years just to try a goblin dog.
|-
!Marco
|What? Pony Head, I thought you said you had a goblin dog before.
|-
!Pony Head
|Well, as it were, uh...
|-
!Marco
|Have you had a goblin dog or not, Pony Head?
|-
!Pony Head
|Uh, I don't know. [laughs] Who can tell? Like... maybe not?
|-
!Marco
|I'm done.
|-
!Star
|Marco, come on. Pony Head didn't mean bad. She's just a liar.
|-
!Marco
|[walks away, angrily muttering]
|-
!Pony Head
|[following] Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
|-
!Marco
|Wait? That's all we've been doing. I'm sweaty, I'm hungry, and on top of everything, you lied about goblin dogs.
|-
!Pony Head
|Look, Marco, I mean, all of these people have lied.
|-
!Koala
|She's right. I lied too. I'm not the one who threw this axe at you.
|-
!Stan
|Hi. My name's Stan.
|-
!Crowd
|Hi Stan.
|-
!Stan
|I'm also a liar. I told my wife this was a mink coat. It's just my body.
|-
!Monster 3
|My glasses are fake. Ooh, it feels good to let that out.
|-
!Monster 4
|These aren't my teeth.
|-
!Star
|Look, we've all lied, and lying is not cool, but there's only one person here who's lied to all of us.
|-
!Koala
|Yeah. Pony Head.
|-
!Crowd
|Yeah!
|-
!Star
|Wait, no. No, no, no. That guy [points at Roy]
|-
!Koala
|Oh, yeah. He did lie to all of us. Get him!
|-
!Crowd
|[starts yelling]
|-
!Roy
|You're gonna lose your place in line. [takes out a shirt-zooka, starts firing at the crowd]
|-
!Pony Head
|Look out Marco.
|-
!
|''Marco gets hit by a t-shirt. ''
|-
!Skeleton
|[gets hit] Skeleton!
|-
!
|''Pony Head casts a magic spell to destroy the shirt-zooka.''
|-
!Roy
|Oh no!
|-
!Star
|Yeah!
|-
!Marco
|Alright Pony Head!
|-
!
|''Roy starts driving the goblin dog truck away. ''
|-
!Star
|He's getting away.
|-
!Marco
|We lost him.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh no we certainly did not. Grab on, turd.
|-
!Marco
|[grabbing on to Pony Head] I'm not sure I like you calling... [aah]!
|-
!Star
|Summoning cloudy charm.
|-
!
|''Pony Head, Marco, and Star chase after the goblin dog truck. When they catch up, Marco throws some goblin dog merchandise at Roy, causing him to swerve the truck.''
|-
!Star
|Magnificence marshmallow mush!
|-
!
|''The truck's wheels turn into marshmallows, and it crashes.''
|-
!Roy
|[falls out, groans]
|-
!Pony Head
|Okay Roy, now get out the goblin dogs.
|-
!Roy
|Look okay, you get me severed horse head. goblin dogs aren't real.
|-
!Pony Head
|What?
|-
!Roy
|It's a ruse. I took you for everything.
|-
!Star
|Come on you guys. Let's just go.
|-
!Roy
|Look, kids, you can have your money back.
|-
!Marco
|You know what? Keep it.
|-
!Star
|Uh, Marco, that was 650 bucks.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah. Well, now every time he sees my 650 dollars, he'll remember the three kids whose dreams he wrecked.
|-
!Roy
|No, I'll just spend the money.
|-
!Star
|He's right Marco. Yeah, we'll take the money, okay, thanks.
|-
!Marco
|No Star, we're going home.
|-
!
|''The trio walks away without the money.''
|-
!Roy
|[giggling, lets the money blow away, runs up to Marco]
|-
!Marco
|What the...
|-
!Roy
|[grabs on to Marco]
|-
!Marco
|Star.
|-
!Roy
|[laughing] You've done it.
|-
!Marco
|Ready when you are, Star.
|-
!
|''Star blasts Roy with her wand.''
|-
!Roy
|No. You earned the goblin dog.
|-
!Marco
|What are you talking about?
|-
!Kelly
|Goblin dogs are real. I had one before.
|-
!Star
|Kelly?
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, we thought you died.
|-
!Marco
|What? No we didn't.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, okay, well, I'm sorry. I thought she did die, so excuse me.
|-
!Marco
|Wait. You've had a goblin dog?
|-
!Kelly
|Got it from Roy.
|-
!Marco
|[to Roy] So goblin dogs are real?
|-
!Roy
|They are. Yes.
|-
!Star
|This was all some kind of trick.
|-
!Roy
|Not a trick. A goblin dog must choose its master through trial, and today, the goblin dog chooses you.
|-
!
|''Roy holds up a bottle of ketchup and mustard. He creates a pentagram on the ground with the two condiments. ''
|-
!All
|Wow!
|-
!
|''The magic symbol teleports them to a temple of some kind.''
|-
!Roy
|Behold!
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh my gosh!
|-
!Star
|Whoa.
|-
!Roy
|Those aren't goblin dogs. [puts them in a microwave] These are goblin dogs.
|-
!Star
|Oh, yeah. Here Pony. Bon apetit.
|-
!
|''They all bite into their goblin dogs.''
|-
!Marco
|This tastes like a normal hot dog.
|-
!Pony Head
|It's basic, but it's good.
|-
!Star
|Hmm. Yeah. I guess I was expecting... [gasps]
|-
!
|''All four of them start having hallucinations.''
|-
!(voice)
|Goblin dogs! Goblin dogs.
|-
!
|''They all wake up back in the desert.''
|-
!Star
|That was amazing!
|-
!Marco
|I gotta give it to you, Pony Head. Those hot dogs were pretty good.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, well, you know, the best for my besties, and whatever, all that kind of stuff. [laughs] But, you guys, on the real, I am so done with this place.
|-
!Marco
|I'm ready to hoof it. [elbow knocks Pony Head]
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh no, you can't say that. No.
|-
!Kelly
|Ugh. Roy makes me go through this every time. Why are those goblin dogs so good?
|-
!Marco
|Hey Kelly, it's been really great talking to you.
|-
!
|''A figure stands up from the top of Kelly's hair.''
|-
!Tad
|Yeah man. It was really cool hangin' out with you too.
|-
!Marco
|What⁈
|-
!Tad
|Oh, hey, I'm Tad. I'm Kelly's boyfriend.
|-
!Marco
|You've been here this whole time?
|-
!Tad
|Yeah, I don't really eat hot dogs. I'm a vegan and stuff. But, you know, I like to hang out.
