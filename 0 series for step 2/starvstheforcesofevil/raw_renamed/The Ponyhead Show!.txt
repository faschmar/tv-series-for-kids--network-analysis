|''Episode begins in a snowy field in [[Mewni]]. A [[Mewmans|Mewman]] man is playing a ''Centipede''-like game on his compact mirror phone.''
|-
!Man
|Okay. Come on, come on, come on, come on. [seethes] Oh! Okay. Whew. Come on, come on. Come on.
|-
!
|''The phone suddenly beeps with an interrupting "ALERT" notification.''
|-
!Man
|Ugh! You...!
|-
![[Seahorse]]
|(''o.s.'') Attention, Mewmans. It's the Ponyhead Show!
|-
!
|''A logo for ''The Ponyhead Show'' appears on the phone screen. [[Pony Head]] bursts through the logo.''
|-
![[Pony Head]]
|That's me!
|-
!Man
|What the...? Noooooo! [echoes]
|-
!Man's Baby
|[crying]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to ''The Ponyhead Show'' camera stage with spotlights.''
|-
!Seahorse
|And now your host. It's... Pony Head!
|-
!
|''Pony Head appears on-screen, and the audience cheers.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, my goodness. Stop it, stop it. You guys are too kind.
|-
!
|''[[Seahorse]] operates the camera. The audience seats are all empty. Two soundspeakers emit applauding and cheering sounds.''
|-
!Pony Head
|I'd like to welcome you all to the very first ever ''Ponyhead Show'', starring me, Pony Head. And if y'all would shut up...
|-
!
|''Music and applause stop.''
|-
!Pony Head
|...I'm going to tell you some jokes. [goes off-camera and comes back with clown nose on her face] Clown nose!
|-
!
|''Screen close-up on Pony Head's clown nose. A male Korean voiceover says "clown nose" in Korean. [[Pony Head family|Shonda and Shinda Pony Head]] and [[Foolduke]]'s white monkey make a rimshot on a pair of drums and a hi-hat.''
|-
![[Foolduke]]'s Monkey
|[hoots]
|-
!
|''The two soundspeakers near Seahorse change from "APPLAUSE" to "LAUGH" and emit the sounds of audience laughter. [[Star Butterfly|Star]] and [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]] appear in the backstage area watching the show.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Okay, well, this probably seems kind of weird, but Pony Head totally knows what she's doing. And I'm... I'm so excited she's going to put you on her show.
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|It's been a while since I've performed in front of an audience, but if you think it's a good idea...
|-
!Star
|Oh, it's a good idea. [opens her phone] Look, Seahorse even set it up so that everyone can watch. ''And'' we can gauge how much the audience likes it.
|-
!
|''On an upvote/downvote meter, ''The Ponyhead Show'' gets one downvote.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|And you're sure this'll get the public on my side?
|-
!Star
|Oh, I know it will. If there's one thing Pony Head knows, it's popularity.
|-
!Pony Head
|And now... staring contest!
|-
!
|''The upvote/downvote meter goes up to 8 downvotes. Star and Eclipsa look at each other.''
|-
!Pony Head
|You have been a great audience, but let's face it, I've been an even greater host. [laughs] We'll be right back, so don't get lonely. But first, a message from our sponsors. [floats off-camera]
|-
!Seahorse
|[floats into the spotlight] ''The Ponyhead Show'' is brought to you by the new Reflectacorp Mirror Deluxe. To access your new mirror, you just need to give a sample of your DNA. [licks phone screen]
|-
!
|''In the backstage area, Pony Head's sisters Azniss and Khrysthalle do her makeup.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Hold up right now! [shoves Azniss and Khrysthalle away] What the heck is that?
|-
!Star
|Pony Head, we talked about this. Eclipsa's going to perform.
|-
!Pony Head
|What? No, I did not say anything about having her perform. She's just supposed to be on the show, like, you know, like, just, like, sit there and, like, just, like, be good.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, don't worry, Pony Head. I've been practicing, and I really think your audience is going to enjoy it.
|-
!Pony Head
|Really? Do you think that right now? Because here's what's tipping me off: your guitar is made out of dead people, okay? So that doesn't feel normal for me, and it's not on brand with my show!
|-
!Eclipsa
|It looks cool.
|-
!Pony Head
|Well, it looks like a pile of bones. We need get rid of that old thing.
|-
!Shonda and Shinda
|[appear behind Eclipsa] We can take it off your hands.
|-
!Pony Head
|You guys remember my sisters Shonda and Shinda.
|-
!Shonda and Shinda
|We're musicians, too. We'll take good care of it. [take Eclipsa's guitar] Bye, Eclipsa. [sink away into cloud wall]
|-
!Pony Head
|Don't worry, girl. I know what I'm talking about.
|-
!Seahorse
|(''o.s.'') And now, welcome back to ''The Ponyhead Show''!
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, I'm on. [shoves Seahorse off-camera]
|-
!Seahorse
|[shrieks, crashes off-screen]
|-
!Pony Head
|Welcome back! [desk, chair, and microphone appear next to her] We have a great show for you tonight. Do you like cooking? Do you also like [[Earth]]? Because later in the show, we have ''Cooking with Earth Turd''!
|-
!
|''[[Marco Diaz]] and [[Kelly]] appear on a cooking stage wearing chef hats. Marco waves at the camera.''
|-
!Pony Head
|But first, you guys are so lucky, because we have a very special celebrity guest. Oh, my gosh, I am so excited to speak with her.
|-
!Star and Eclipsa
|[looking hopeful]
|-
!Pony Head
|It's me! I'm the celebrity guest.
|-
!Star and Eclipsa
|[groans]
|-
![[Kelly]]
|Why are we doing all this prep? Aren't cooking shows fake?
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|[cutting onions] Yeah— No, no, no, cooking shows are real. Uh, wrestling is fake. Can you pass me the salt?
|-
!Kelly
|Wait, what did you just say?
|-
!Marco
|I said can you pass the salt?
|-
!Kelly
|No, before that.
|-
!Marco
|Uh, I said that wrestling is fake.
|-
!Kelly
|[wide-eyed shock]
|-
!Marco
|(''o.s.'') Kelly? Are you okay?
|-
!Kelly
|[walks off-stage] I have cramps.
|-
!Marco
|Kelly?
|-
!Star
|Aw, man, Pony Head sure is taking forever.
|-
!Eclipsa
|[snoring]
|-
!Azniss Pony Head
|Hey, you ready for makeup, Eclipsa?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[wakes up] Ooh, I didn't know I'm getting my makeup done.
|-
!Khrysthalle Pony Head
|It's nothing fancy. It's just a touch-up before you go on.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Righty-ho. [follows Azniss and Khrysthalle]
|-
!
|''Foolduke's monkey plays the piano on-camera, with Pony Head sitting on the piano wearing a blond wig, blue dress, and lipstick.''
|-
!Pony Head
|When you tell your daughter that she is beautiful... you're saying to her, "Who you are is how you look." You are saying to her, "The person you are on the inside, the person who is good at roller skates, the person whose beautiful singing voice fills the halls of this home, the person whose unparalleled drawing and painting abilities is less important than the person you appear to be."
|-
!
|''Backstage, Marco knocks on Kelly's dressing room door.''
|-
!Marco
|Uh, Kelly? [sighs] I'm so sorry I—
|-
!Kelly
|[appears behind Marco] Marco, why are you talking to my dressing room?
|-
!Marco
|Oh, I... I thought you were in there. I don't... Anyway, I... I just want to say I'm... I'm sorry. I... I didn't know you didn't know about wrestling.
|-
!Kelly
|Oh, no, it's fine. I'm over it.
|-
!Marco
|Oh. Really? Because it seems like you were upset.
|-
!Kelly
|No, no. I mean, you did ruin wrestling for me, that's true. But you know, I just walked around and dealt with it. Let's go make some sandwiches. It's not like you've never ruined anything before.
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!
|''Cut back to ''The Ponyhead Show''.''
|-
!Pony Head
|And finally, it's time for a very special segment that I know you've all been waiting for. It's self-defense your mama never taught you! [puts on wrestling mask, holding boxing gloves, grunts]
|-
!Star
|Ugh! Pony Head! Seahorse, go to commercial.
|-
!Pony Head
|[swinging boxing gloves, grunting]
|-
!Audience
|[cheers]
|-
!Pony Head
|See that? It's all in the neck. [panting]
|-
!
|''Star pulls Pony Head off-camera.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Whoa! What?! What are you doing?! We're on live television!
|-
!Star
|What am ''I'' doing? What are ''you'' doing?
|-
!Pony Head
|Uh, I think I'm owning it.
|-
!Star
|Owning it? You are renting it at best. And really, you're just making people mad. They don't like this, Pony. And it is getting worse.
|-
!
|''The upvote/downvote meter goes up to 558 downvotes.
|-
!Pony Head
|You asked me to make Eclipsa popular. I'm going to make her popular.
|-
!Star
|Then why don't you put her on?
|-
!Pony Head
|Ugh! I can't put her on if she's not even here!
|-
!Star
|Oh, excuses—! Wait, where is she?
|-
!Pony Head
|I don't know, but she's missing out. [floats away]
|-
!
|''Laughter is heard coming from Eclipsa's dressing room.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, no.
|-
!
|''Inside the dressing room, Pony Head's sisters do Eclipsa's makeup.''
|-
!Azniss
|[holding powdering stick] It's all about the 'tude, 'clipsa. You got to be mean.
|-
!Hornanne Pony Head
|[holding hairspray] Yeah, you don't want to be understood. You want to be feared. [rattles can, sprays]
|-
!Star
|[kicks in dressing room door] Where's Eclipsa?! What have you done with her?!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa spins around in her chair. She has a wild hairstyle and is wearing glasses with wacky frames, a leopard-print suit, and purple high-heels.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|How do I look?
|-
!Star
|Ohhhh, that is more than just a touch-up.
|-
!
|''Shouting is heard outside Pony Head's house.''
|-
!Woman 1
|(''o.s.'') I want my compact back!
|-
!
|An angry mob of Mewmans shouts outside the front gates of Pony Head's house.''
|-
!Mewmans
|[yelling, "Get this show off my phone!", "Turn this garbage off!"]
|-
!Star
|What is wrong with these people? If they don't like the show, they could just turn it off.
|-
!Seahorse
|Actually, they can't do that.
|-
!Star
|What? Why?
|-
!Seahorse
|Oh, I hacked their compacts. It's impossible for them to turn it off.
|-
!Star
|What?! Why would you do that?!
|-
!Seahorse
|I'm so glad you asked. You can do anything with Reflectacorp mobile technology.
|-
!Star
|Ugh! Eclipsa, I am so sorry. This is a train wreck. Pony Head is crazy. Why do I always forget that? I think you should just back out of the show.
|-
!Eclipsa
|No, no, it's okay. I want to go through with it. In for a penny, in for a pound.
|-
!Star
|But this is a P.R. disaster.
|-
!Eclipsa
|How is that any different than the rest of my life? At least I get the chance to formally introduce myself to my people.
|-
!Star
|You know what? You're right. Okay, Eclipsa, let's make them LOVE YOU. But first thing's first. This outfit.
|-
!Eclipsa
|No, no, I'm definitely changing out of it.
|-
!Star
|Oh, okay, good. Then we'll make them LOVE YOU.
|-
!
|''Cut back to ''The Ponyhead Show''. Pony Head is telling a story to the viewers. Behind her, Marco looks bored and disappointed, and Kelly is patting him on the back.''
|-
!Pony Head
|...So, I asked him to buy me a $60,000 necklace, obviously. And he was like, "You don't even have shoulders. How are you going to wear a necklace?" And I was all, "What?! Have you ever seen a necklace?! It's not a jacket! it's for a neck! And guess what! I have one, dummy!" And then I dumped him.
|-
!
|''Star uses Raspberry Ribbon Lasso to pull Pony Head off-camera.''
|-
!Pony Head
|How many times you going to—?!
|-
!Star
|[plugs Pony Head's mouth with Cupcake Blast]
|-
!Pony Head
|[muffled shouting]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Uh, hi. [waves to camera] I'm Eclipsa. Uh, queen. [chuckles] Um... [takes out her guitar] I'm going to play you a song here. I wrote it.
|-
!
|''Star turns on a single spotlight on Eclipsa, and Seahorse points the camera at her. She starts singing [[Here I Am]].''

!
|''The angry mob stops shouting and looks at their phones.''

!Eclipsa
|♪ Those you know are gone ♪<br />♪ And suddenly you have the crown ♪<br />♪ Here I am, this is me ♪<br />♪ Brokenhearted but finally free ♪

|''Marco and Kelly look awestruck.''

|♪ Centuries from my home ♪<br />♪ Can't go back, so let's start something new ♪<br />♪ Here I am, this is me ♪<br />♪ Open-hearted, I proudly decree ♪<br />♪ Now as queen, I am yours ♪<br />♪ Let's make magic and reach for the stars ♪<br />♪ Let's make magic and reach for the stars ♪
|-
!Marco
|Wow...
|-
!Pony Head
|[spits out Cupcake Blast] Whoa, hold up. You guys like that?
|-
!
|''A tomato splats against a window near Star, and the angry mob outside resumes shouting.''
|-
!Mewmans
|[yelling, "Give me back my compact, you evil witch!", "Give me back my compact!", "Can you please give me back my phone?!"]
|-
!
|''Star looks at her phone. The upvote/downvote meter is at over 4,900 downvotes and zero upvotes. Star closes the phone and uses her magic to poof away all the broadcasting equipment.''
|-
!Seahorse
|Aah! You could've just pulled the plug.
|-
!Star
|Oh, we should have pulled the plug a long time ago.
|-
!Marco
|It's over? I never got to show off [[Rafael Diaz|my dad]]'s recipe for tortas ahogadas.
|-
!Kelly
|You should come make it at my house sometime.
|-
!Marco
|Sure!
|-
!Star
|Uh, Eclipsa? That was an awesome song. I'm sorry nobody else liked it. [sighs] I'm sorry I dragged you into this. But don't worry, we'll find a way to get the people of Mewni to love you.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, don't be so hasty. Every single one of my boyfriends hated me before they loved me.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I don't have any regrets. I'd rather be hated for who I am than liked for who I pretend to be.
|-
!Pony Head
|Wait, don't you want to be fake and hated?
|-
!
|''The angry mob outside the house disperses. A little girl is humming "Here I Am", and she upvotes ''The Ponyhead Show''.
