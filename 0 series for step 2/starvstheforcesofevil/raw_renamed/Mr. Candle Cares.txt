|''Episode begins inside Echo Creek Academy, at the Guidance Counselor's office''
|-
!'''[[Oskar Greason]]'''
| Mr. Candle said I'm gonna be a musician.
|-
!'''Chet'''
| Sweet. I got champion swimmer. I was gonna get dressed, but now I don't need to.
|-
!'''[[Marco Diaz]]'''
| Wow. Everyone's getting really awesome careers.
|-
!'''[[Star Butterfly]]'''
| I can't wait to find out what my future holds. [nervous laughter]
|-
!'''[[Mr. Candle]]'''
| Star Butterfly. Please sit
|-
!'''Star'''
| Okay
|-
!'''Candle'''
| Help yourself to some candy.
|-
!'''Star'''
| No, thank you. I'm just really excited to have my fortune told. How do you do it? Read palms? Converse with the dead? Examine head lumps?
|-
!'''Candle'''
| Nope. Just normal guidance counselor stuff. Have you given much thought to your future?
|-
!'''Star'''
| Totally. When I grow up, I wanna raise warnicorns [spawns a warnicorn]
|-
!'''Candle'''
| Well, that seems like a fun hobby but you might not have much time for hobbies as the queen of Mewni.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [warnicorn neighs] Queen?
|-
!'''Candle'''
| I may not know your fortune, but your future is set in stone.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Stone?
|-
!'''Candle'''
| Are you dating anyone?
|-
!'''Star'''
| What? Uh, no.
|-
!'''Candle'''
| What about that Marco boy? Got a secret crush on him?
|-
!'''Star'''
| He's my roommate. We're just friends.
|-
!'''Candle'''
| Yeah, that's weird to date your roommate. Maybe someone else then. It's never too early to start searching for the future king of Mewni.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Maybe
|-
!'''Candle'''
| Cheer up Star. Or should I say, Your Majesty?
|-
!'''Star'''
| Hmm.
|-
!
|''Star leaves the counseling office''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| So how'd it go? [Star walks by him] Or we can catch up later.
|-
!
|''Marco is now in the counseling office.''
|-
!'''Candle'''
| Mr. Diaz. I've been very anxious to speak to you.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Seen my test scores, have you?
|-
!'''Candle'''
| Indeed.
|-
!
|''Sometime later''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Garbage Island⁈ What's the use of taking honors classes if it gets you sent to the middle of nowhere?
|-
!'''Star'''
| So don't go. At least you have a choice. Apparently, the only thing in my future is being queen.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Oh, man, I'd love to be queen. You never have to think about what to wear; you have somebody do that for you.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [groans]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| People would just love you because they have to, no matter how weird you are.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [groans]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| You never have to bathe alone.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Marco, please stop talking.
|-
!
|''Mr. Candle visits the men's restroom''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Head janitor, Garbage Island.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [sighs]
|-
!
|''Marco enters the restroom and hears a plopping sound''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| I'll come back later.
|-
!
|''A fiery explosion in one of the stalls causes Marco to investigate. He finds that it's caused by Candle dumping some mysterious substance into the toilets.''
|-
!'''Candle'''
| All right sir, phase one is complete. What's next? Sir, are you there?
|-
!
|''Tom's face appears in the toilet's water''
|-
!'''[[Tom]]'''
| You idiot! You forgot the most important part. Me!
|-
!'''Candle'''
| I got confirmation. Starco is completely platonic.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Starco?
|-
!'''Tom'''
| Make sure there's no possibility of them ever being a thing.
|-
!'''Candle'''
| Absolutely, sir.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| Also, stop offering everyone candy. You're gonna blow my cover. I want her back.
|-
!'''Candle'''
| I gotta go.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| I'm not done.
|-
!'''Candle'''
| No. You don't understand. [puts his hands over his pants] I gotta go.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| Flush me first.
|-
!
|''Later, Mr. Candle enters his office whistling''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Hey Mr. Candle.
|-
!'''Candle'''
| [startled] Oh, hello Marco.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| I appreciate all your guidance with Garbage Island and all, but I'm gonna pass [crumples Garbage Island flyer and throws it into the trash can but he misses]. Actually, I was just thinking I might be king of Mewni.
|-
!'''Candle'''
| [spluttering his drink] What⁈
|-
!'''Marco'''
| The thing is, Star and I have recently become smooch buddies. On the lips.
|-
!'''Candle'''
| Even if that's true kid, you shouldn't say that out loud.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Yeah, we've been trying all styles. German, Italian, Polynesian. My tongue is so tired, I can't feel my teeth.
|-
!
|''The cat-shaped candy bold explodes into a pillar of flame, revealing Tom.''
|-
!'''Tom'''
| [ferocious growl]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Busted. I knew you weren't a guidance counselor. [points at Mr. Candle when his cover is blown]
|-
!
|''Tom grabs Marco by the collar to take him to the underworld.''
|-
!
|''At the Diaz's house, Star reads a magazine about being a queen.''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh. These women look so miserable. [sighs heavily, goes to her mirror]
|-
!'''Mirror'''
| Calling Mom
|-
!'''[[Queen Butterfly]]'''
| What did you do?
|-
!'''Star'''
| What... nothing! Yet. I'd like to ask you something. Are you happy?
|-
!'''Queen'''
| Happy? What difference does that make?
|-
!'''Star'''
| I mean, I don't know. Do you have any warnicorns?
|-
!'''Queen'''
| Goffrey, do I have any warnicorns?
|-
!'''Goffrey'''
| You have 19, Your Majesty.
|-
!'''Queen'''
| Oh. Apparently I have 19.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh, sweet.
|-
!'''Queen'''
| But when you are queen, you don't have time for warnicorns.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh.
|-
!'''Queen'''
| Everything I'm saying is in your guide book. Incidentally, you may want to review the chapter on hair care.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [brushes her hair sadly]
|-
!'''Queen'''
| If you're going to be queen, you have to look the part. Don't worry so much about happiness. It makes you look pale. Love you. Bye.
|-
!
|''Star stares comprehensively at her guide book for a while''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Hmm.
|-
!
|''She smiles as she gets out a hair trimmer and turns it on''
|-
!
|''The scene switches back to Marco, now in Tom's lair. He is being vertically spun on some kind of torture device.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Stop! I knew you were listening. I never made out with Star.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| [snaps; the wheel stops spinning]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| I just said that to get your goat.
|-
!'''Skull on wall'''
| What?
|-
!'''Tom'''
| You lied to me.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Well, you lied to Star. You made her think all she's good for is being queen.
|-
!
|''Tom frowns and walks away from Marco''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Dude, just take me home.
|-
!
|''Tom snaps again, which releases Marco in to a tub of water.''
|-
!'''Tom'''
| I can't do that; you know too much. Now I gotta destroy you.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| What⁈ That's not fair.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| All right, fine. Battle to the death. I win, you die.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| What do I get if I win?
|-
!'''Tom'''
| [laughs] It's not gonna happen. So, yeah, ask for whatever you want.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| If I win, you gotta take me home, and you gotta tell Star the truth.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| Fine. Pick your weapon. Dueling battle axes? Rhino fiend joust? Pear grenades of anguish?
|-
!
|''A pear shrieks and explodes.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [pointing elsewhere] What about ping-pong?
|-
!'''Tom'''
| [shrugs] That's cool.
|-
!Small-headed demon
| [holds out a basket full of paddles] Your weapon of choice, my liege.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| I oughta warn you, I'm not only a karate master, I'm also good at ball sports.
|-
!
|''Marco serves the ball to Tom, who smacks it so hard that it breaks Marco's paddle and injuries his hand.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Ow!
|-
!'''Demon'''
| Point, Master Tom.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [grabs another paddle] Okay, so I'm a little rusty. Wait till you... hi-yah!
|-
!
|''Marco surprise serves the ball, Tom smacks it and once again breaks Marco's paddle.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Owww!
|-
!
|''Scene switches back to Star. She tears a poster of a queen off the wall, puts on eye liner, lipstick, skull stickers, spiked arm bracelets. She also intentionally tears her pants and grabs a battle axe.''
|-
!
|''Scene returns to Marco's ping-pong game. ''
|-
!'''Demon'''
| Game point.
|-
!
|''Tom serves the ball rather slowly''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [swinging furiously] In your face!
|-
!
|''Tom easily bounces the ball back, and it smacks Marco in the forehead.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Ow! Ugh! Since when do ping-pong balls hurt so much?
|-
!'''Tom'''
| These balls are guided by demons.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Okay. Let's play for real this time. Double or nothing.
|-
!Small-headed demon
| Dude, you're out of paddles, just give up.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| No, it's fine. Here, you can have mine [throws it at Marco]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Ugh!
|-
!'''Tom'''
| I don't need it [levitates ball with finger]
|-
!
|''Marco ducks as the ball barely misses his head and cause a huge dent in an arcade machine. ''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Hey! Isn't this kind of cheating?
|-
!'''Tom'''
| You think this is cheating? You should try playing Star at ping-pong.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Well, Star doesn't really cheat, she just makes up her own rules.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| And then she changes the rules again halfway through the game.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Oh, so that's why I never win.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| She just does whatever she wants.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Yeah, that's Star.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| Yeah. She is kinda awesome. [brief silence] You know you're never gonna win, right?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| I know, but you're not either. It doesn't matter if you beat me at ping-pong or pull out all my organs. You can't make Star be your girlfriend unless she wants to.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the Diaz's house. A torrent of flame delivers Marco back. ''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Star, I have something to tell...
|-
!
|''Marco notices Star has totally changed her appearance to be more punk.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Whoa.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh hey Marco. Did you know that if you cut off a mermaid's tail, you can never be queen? It's all in the guide book.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Star, you don't have to do that.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh, thank goodness. I'm so sorry Tiffany; I never wanted to hurt you.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Shameful [Tom walks in].
|-
!'''Star'''
| Tom! What's going on?
|-
!'''Tom'''
| I have something I need to confess. I used Mr. Candle to try to get back together with you, and it took me destroying Marco 58 games to zero to realize I was wrong. Like, I slaughtered him. I mean, beating him was so easy.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Okay, she gets it.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| All I wanted was to get you back, but I never stopped to consider what you wanted. I'm sorry.
|-
!
|''Star smiles and punches Tom aggressively in the chest.''
|-
!'''Tom'''
| Ow!
|-
!'''Star'''
| You tricked me, but it doesn't even make a difference. I'm still gonna be queen.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Yeah, but that doesn't sound like a bad thing because you're gonna run Mewni your way, no matter how destructive.
|-
!'''Star'''
| That's true [throws the guide book away and creates another warnicorn, hugs Marco]
|-
!'''Demon'''
| Point, Marco.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| [Sadly] Well, I should go. by the way, I like your hair.
|-
!
|''Star smiles, Tom levitates himself back in to the elevator, descending down to the underworld. ''
|-
!'''Star'''
| So you guys were hangin' out?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Uh, yup.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Is he still dark and broody?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Oh yeah, but he's not so bad.
|-
!
|''Scene changes back to the counseling office''
|-
!'''Candle'''
| No Brittany, I don't believe your life has peaked at such a young age.
|-
!'''Tom'''
| [burst in to room via flame] Dude, abort the mission; we're done.
|-
!'''Candle'''
| [whistles, opens window, and flies away on a file cabinet]
