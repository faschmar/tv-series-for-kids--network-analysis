|''Episode begins outside [[Star Butterfly|Star]]'s bedroom; the mail delivery monster girl from "[[Ransomgram]]" knocks on her door. The door opens.''
|-
!Mail Monster
|Hello, [[Star Butterfly]]! I have a special delivery for—
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no! Rainbow Fist Punch!
|-
!
|''Star sends the monster girl flying with a Rainbow Fist.''
|-
!Mail Monster
|[grunts]
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Star, why did you just punch that lady?
|-
!Star
|Uh, that is the ransomgram lady. She's here to ransom us.
|-
!Mail Monster
|[on the ground] No. I also deliver the mail sometimes. This is just mail.
|-
!Star
|Oh. Sorry! [takes mail from monster girl]
|-
!Mail Monster
|[dusts herself off] No, it's fine. People, uh... People do that—
|-
!Star
|Okay, thank you, bye! [closes bedroom door] Oh, no!
|-
!Marco
|What is it?
|-
!Star
|[shows Marco the letter] [[Quest Buy (store)|Quest Buy]] is closing! They're having a Going Out of Business sale right now!
|-
!Marco
|Quest Buy is closing? [gasps] Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah! All right! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! All right! [dancing] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. All right! [screams enthusiastically] Yeah! Oh! [victory pose]
|-
!Star
|[stammering] What are you so happy about?
|-
!Marco
|This is the Going Out of Business sale! That means Quest Buy is closing down forever. It's, like, the happiest day of my life. I hate Quest Buy.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, but what happens, say, if something happens to your wallet? If there's no Quest Buy, you can't get another one!
|-
!Marco
|Wait, you mean my dab-coat, bad-lad, bad-2-da-bone, tri-tone, triple-locking, thumbprint-activated-surity security wallet in Prussian blue?
|-
!Star
|Oh, yeah, baby.
|-
!Marco
|Which I purchased on a previous trip to Quest Buy?
|-
!Star
|Uh, yeah, baby!
|-
!Marco
|Based on the rate of decay, if I'm gonna live to be a hundred, I'm gonna need... [whispering] one, two, three, four, five, six... sixteen of these things! We gotta go to Quest Buy.
|-
![[Janna Ordonia|Janna]]
|[appears next to Marco] Classic Diaz, doin' the math. [takes Marco's wallet]
|-
!Marco
|What?! [[Janna Ordonia|Janna]]?!
|-
!Star
|[opens [[dimensional portal]] with [[dimensional scissors]], gasps] Janna!
|-
!Janna
|So, are we doin' this thing or what?
|-
!Marco
|Wait! W-W-Wait a second! H-How did you get here?
|-
!Janna
|[chuckles] Wouldn't you like to know?
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, I would like to know. That's why I asked the question.
|-
!Star
|[pushes Marco toward portal] No one cares, Marco! The important thing is Janna's here! Let's go, guys!
|-
!Marco
|Fine. But we're gonna come back to this.
|-
!
|''Star tries to push Marco and Janna into the portal, but something pushes back.''
|-
!Star
|Huh? [straining]
|-
!Marco
|It's... It's like there's something—!
|-
!Star
|Come on, Diaz! Suck in that gut! [straining]
|-
!
|''On the other side of the portal, Star, Marco, and Janna arrive in an overly crowded Quest Buy.''
|-
!Customers
|[shouting indistinctly]
|-
!Star
|Oh, my gosh. What is going on? This is crazy!
|-
![[Quest Buy sloth clerks|Sloth]]
|[over P.A. system] Attention, customers. Don't miss our Going Out of Business sale.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco are carried away by the crowd.''
|-
!Marco
|Uh, this is way more people than I'm comfortable with!
|-
!Star
|Wait. Head count. Where's Janna? Janna! Where are you?
|-
!Janna
|[gets carried away in opposite direction] I'm good, I'm good. Yeah, and, uh, don't wait up!
|-
!
|''[[Talon Raventalon]] runs across an aisle, screaming and throwing boxes of bird seed and a couple of other customers into his shopping cart. Johnny Blowhole and a horned, hairy man fight over a ''Man Mower''-brand electric razor.''
|-
!Hairy Man
|That's my Man Mower, ya porpoise!
|-
!Johnny Blowhole
|[dolphin chirping]
|-
!Star
|[looking from top of a shelf] Okay, Marco, let's just grab your sixteen wallets and get outta here. Okay, right there!
|-
!
|''Marco shoves through the crowd of customers to reach the display of wallets and coin purses.''
|-
!Marco
|Wallets!
|-
!
|''The entire display is empty.''
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] Bye-bye.
|-
!Star
|Oh, look! More wallets right over there!
|-
!Customers
|[gasp]
|-
!
|''A sloth employee appears pushing a cart with more wallets on it. The customers shove past Star and Marco and ambush the sloth. All the wallets are taken, and the sloth is reduced to a skeleton.''
|-
!Marco
|[groans] We're never getting these wallets.
|-
!Janna
|(''o.s.'') Do you ladies need help with anything?
|-
!
|''Janna appears wearing a Quest Buy employee shirt and the nametag of an employee named Stu.''
|-
!Star
|Janna, who's Stu?
|-
!Janna
|Who's Janna?
|-
!Skeleton
|Uh... what do I do?
|-
!Janna
|You're fired.
|-
!Skeleton
|[walks away]
|-
!Janna
|Ugh, I'm doing him a favor. Come on, let's go!
|-
!
|''Janna leads Star and Marco to the stockroom entrance, and Star turns on the lights.''
|-
!Star
|Whoa.
|-
!
|''The stockroom entrance has multiple "KEEP OUT" and "DO NOT ENTER" signs, stop signs, danger/warning signs, hazard signs, and "KEEP OUT" written in large red letters.''
|-
!Janna
|"Keep out."
|-
!Marco
|Something tells me they don't want us to go in there.
|-
!Janna
|Oh, wait. What's this?
|-
!
|''Janna pushes a warning sign aside and sees a small sticker behind it that says "EMPLOYEES ONLY".''
|-
!Janna
|"Employees only." Nope, we're good!
|-
!
|''The warehouse door into the stockroom opens.''
|-
!Janna
|Behold. Stockroom! Or whatever.
|-
!
|''All the shelves in the stockroom are empty and covered in cobwebs.''
|-
!Star
|Huh. Where's all the stock?
|-
!Janna
|Don't ask me. I just work here.
|-
!Marco
|What's with this place?! I'm never gonna get my wallet! [slams face on a shelf] Why do I live?
|-
!Star
|Uh, Marco? Look.
|-
!Marco
|Wait, what?
|-
!
|''Sixteen security wallets appear on the shelf next to Marco.''
|-
!Marco
|[counts quickly, gasps] There are exactly sixteen wallets here!
|-
!Star
|What?! It's like this place can read our... [makes concentrating face]
|-
!Janna
|Read our what?
|-
!Star
|[gasping] Unicorn cake! Unicorn cake!
|-
!
|''Star runs up to a unicorn made of cake.''
|-
!Star
|Do you see? Unicorn! Unicorn! [jumps onto unicorn cake and hugs it] I have always wanted to do this.
|-
!Janna
|And I've always wanted to do this.
|-
!Unicorn Cake
|Aww.
|-
!
|''Janna bites into the unicorn cake's neck. When she pulls away, the cake's bite mark spews raspberry jam like blood.''
|-
!Unicorn Cake
|Aah! [groaning] Aw, don't pay that no mind. It's only raspberry!
|-
!Marco
|[sitting in massage chair, soaking his feet in tub] You guys, this place has everything!
|-
!Unicorn Cake
|It's true!
|-
!Star
|Shopping spreeeeeee!
|-
!Janna
|Ermahgerd.
|-
!
|''A giant floating eyeball blinks at Janna.''
|-
!Janna
|I've always wanted one of these! [skull-shaped beanbag appears behind her] Just a second. [jumps onto beanbag chair] Please, continue. [slurps drink]
|-
!Star

|''Marco opens a jar of "Pizza in a Jar" with an automatic jar opener.''
|-
!Marco
|Ahh. Convenience. [flaming arrow shoots his hat and headphones off] Aah!
|-
!Janna
|[holding a crossbow] Sorry. My bad. The crossbow's got a hair trigger.
|-
!Star
|[wearing rainbow boots] Janna Fanna Fo-Fanna! Just look at these boots!
|-
!Marco
|[holding oddly-shaped speaker device with a lightbulb on one side] Hey, guys! Check out this amazing item of relaxation!
|-
!Janna
|What does it do?
|-
!Marco
|I don't even know! I love this place so much!
|-
!Janna
|Yeah, it's like everything we've ever wanted just appears.
|-
!Star
|You know, people keep saying, "Don't wander in creepy places", uh, but it's working out pretty fine for us.
|-
!
|''A sloth employee appears, watching Star, Marco, and Janna while taking long slurps of his soft drink.''
|-
!Star
|Uh, guys? I think we're about to be busted.
|-
!Janna
|That's my favorite part!
|-
!Sloth
|Oh, don't mind me. [slurps, gulps] I'm just waiting.
|-
!Marco
|What are you waiting for?
|-
!Sloth
|[echoing] What?
|-
!Marco
|[echoing] I said, what are you waiting for?!
|-
!Sloth
|Sorry. The acoustics are really bad in here. I'll come to you.
|-
!
|''The sloth employee walks up to Star, Marco, and Janna very slowly while sipping his drink.''
|-
!Sloth
|I'm waiting for your brains to go gooey. [slurps]
|-
!Star
|What?! Why would our brains go gooey?
|-
!Sloth
|Well, why didn't you tell 'em, Stu? You know that everybody who wanders back here's brain turns to goo.
|-
!Janna
|Oh, yeah. Sometimes, Stu's brain goes gooey.
|-
!Sloth
|[laughs] Classic Stu. [slurps]
|-
!Star
|Well, our brains feel fine, thank you very much.
|-
!Sloth
|Well, yeah. They're fine for now. You're in a magical room that turns all your needless desires into pointless realities. [to Marco] Your sixteen wallets. [to Star] Your vibrant fashions. [to Janna] Your... uh...
|-
!Janna
|[wearing demon hat] Yeah, I don't know either, dude.
|-
!Star
|So, whatever we want just appears here?
|-
!Sloth
|[slurps] Pretty much.
|-
!Janna
|Cool. [straining]
|-
!Star
|Janna?
|-
!
|''Janna creates a baby version of Marco with wheels for hands.''
|-
!Baby Marco
|I'm baby Marco, and I got wheels for hands! Wheeeee! [speeds off]
|-
!Marco
|[to Janna] Why?!
|-
!Janna
|'Cause I can. [straining, makes another baby Marco]
|-
!Baby Marco
|I'm baby Marco, and I got wheels for hands! Wheeeee! [speeds off]
|-
!Star
|Janna.
|-
!Janna
|Aw, come on. That was for you, too, girl.
|-
!Sloth
|See? Your brains just keep makin' stuff you want, you're never gonna wanna leave, then your brains turn to goo. [shows dozens of customers in cages] It happens to everybody that wanders back here.
|-
!
|''A teenage girl in a crown and ragged clothes and bloodshot eyes has her own hamster band toy playing distorted music.''
|-
!Star
|Whoa. How did we not see all those cages? What kinda creepy stuff are you pullin' here, bub?
|-
!Sloth
|We're just keeping these people safe. They can leave whenever. [opens teenage girl's cage]
|-
!Girl
|[whimpering, steps out of the cage] Maybe just one more song. [returns to her cage, squeals]
|-
!Sloth
|[slurps] They just don't want to leave their stuff. Well, I'll start getting your cages ready. [walks away]
|-
!Star
|Oh, you hear that, guys? He's gettin' our cages ready.
|-
!Janna
|Yeah. It's like he thinks this is the first time we've been trapped in a back room.
|-
!Marco
|Hey! My dude! We're pros at these, uh, "situations". I don't think we're gonna need the cages.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, we're just gonna head on out.
|-
!Sloth
|Sure. The exit's right over there. But you're never gonna make it without filling up these shelves with needless desires.
|-
!Star
|[scoffs] Okay, bub. Feels like you're not really gettin' who we are. We don't need stuff. I mean, sure, a little dancing penguin baby would be tight.
|-
!
|''A dancing penguin baby appears next to Star.''
|-
!Star
|Yeah, that's pretty tight. But I don't really need it.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, and I've always wanted a talking bike named Wheelie.
|-
!
|''A talking bike named Wheelie appears next to Marco.''
|-
!Wheelie
|I'm right here, Marco!
|-
!Marco
|But Wheelie's not really what's important.
|-
!Wheelie
|What?
|-
!Janna
|And I think we all want an evil Marco with a mole on the other side of his face.
|-
!
|''An evil Marco with a mole on the other side of his face appears next to Janna.''
|-
!ocraM
|I am ocraM!
|-
!Janna
|I think we want hundreds of ocraMs.
|-
!
|''Hundreds of ocraMs appear behind Janna.''
|-
!ocraMs
|I am ocraM!
|-
!Marco
|[looks completely shocked]
|-
!Janna
|(''o.s.'') But we don't really care.
|-
!Star
|Look, I'm sure a lot of people get caught up in whatever this is, but we're not a lot of people. We're three people. We've got everything we want right here. Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, and Janna start to walk away. Marco's face is frozen in wide-eyed shock.''
|-
!Star
|Whew! What a crazy place, am I right?
|-
!Janna
|Yeah. You can make, like, whatever.
|-
!Star
|That was a pretty cool bike you made, Marco.
|-
!Marco
|[still shocked]
|-
!Star
|You named him "Wheelie" and everything. But, hey, you told them, "Who needs stuff when you've got friends?"
|-
!Janna
|Yeah! It's not like stuff ever cares about ya.
|-
!Star
|[laughs] Yeah!
|-
!Baby Marcos
|Bye, Marco!
|-
!Wheelie
|[bell rings]
|-
!
|''A sloth employee rings up Marco's wallets at the cash register.''
|-
!Star
|[sighs] You know, I'm really gonna miss Quest Buy. We have got so many memories here.
|-
!Janna
|Yeah. It's a shame it's gonna be wiped from existence. Never to be seen from again.
|-
!Marco
|Wait. I need to go get something!
|-
!Sloth
|I'm sorry, but Quest Buy is now closed.
|-
!Marco
|But... But I need to save the babies!
|-
!Sloth
|[into microphone] Thank you, local customers, for shopping at Quest Buy. Have a good... whatever.
|-
!
|''Quest Buy vanishes into thin air, leaving behind a banner that reads "OUT OF BUSINESS" and a single cash register.''
|-
!Star
|What a weird, weird, sometimes terrifying, magical place.
