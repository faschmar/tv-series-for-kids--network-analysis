|''Episode begins at the [[Diaz Household]]; music is heard inside. [[Star Butterfly|Star]] and [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] appear outside through a [[dimensional portal]].''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|All right. We'll just pop in and pop out real quick, 'cause I've got that royal squire mixer this afternoon.
|-
!
|''A woman runs out of the house wearing a baby diaper on her head and a sash that reads "DIAPER QUEEN" and waving a baby diaper flag.''
|-
!Woman
|Aah! I caught the bouquet! I caught the bouquet! I caught the bouquet!
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|So... what kind of party is this?
|-
!Marco
|[looking at stork statue] Bird... Bird Day? Bird Day? Is that a thing? Bird Day?
|-
!Star
|Doesn't it say on the invite? [takes party invitation out of Marco's hand]
|-
!Marco
|Star, I'm a squire of Mewni. I don't have time to read invites!
|-
!Star
|Seems to be some kind of kid-washing party.
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!Star
|Yeah. A "baby shower".
|-
!Marco
|I guess someone's having a baby.
|-
!Star
|A dirty baby, it sounds like, seeing as to how they're gonna wash it.
|-
![[Angie Diaz]]
|Marco!
|-
!Marco
|Hey, Mom. So, who's having the baby?
|-
!Angie
|Can't you tell?
|-
!
|''Angie turns slightly to the side to reveal she's pregnant. Star excitedly bobs up and down.''
|-
!Marco
|[gasps] Mom?! You're gonna be... a mom?! When did this happen?!
|-
![[Rafael Diaz]]
|Oh, while you were out on [[Mewni]]. And you're going to be a big brother! [shows an ultrasound sonogram] Say hello to your ''hermanito'' – Marco Junior!
|-
!Star
|[deep gasp] Oh-my-gosh, oh-my-gosh, oh-my-gosh, oh-my-gosh!
|-
!Marco
|Wait, what? You're naming him Marco Junior?
|-
!Angie
|After you.
|-
!Marco
|That's not how it works! You don't name your son after your son!
|-
!Angie
|[points at Marco Jr.'s mole] But he's got a little mole just like you, "Marco Senior".
|-
!Marco
|Wow... A brother! How have I not heard about this until now?
|-
!Angie
|It's okay. You've been busy. Point is, you're here today. Now, give your mom a hug!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, yeah, okay. [gives Angie a weak one-armed hug]
|-
!Angie
|[grimly] I spent thirty-seven hours squeezing you out of my body, and this is what I get?
|-
!Marco
|Oh, I just didn't want to—
|-
!Angie
|[threateningly] Give your mother a hug.
|-
!Marco
|[nervously] Okay.
|-
!
|''Marco and Angie share a tight, warm hug.''
|-
!Rafael
|Now come on! We have a baby to shower!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to house interior. Party guests mingle about and eat and drink food.''
|-
!Star
|[feels Angie's belly] Whoa! I felt him kick! We might have to find a spot for this little guy on the Mewni King's Guard!
|-
!Rafael
|[laughs] No, I think stealing one of our sons is enough for now, Star.
|-
!Marco
|[pushes Star aside] Oh, oh, oh! He's kicking? He's kicking?
|-
!Angie
|[sarcastic] Why, yes, Marco, you may touch my stomach.
|-
!Marco
|...I don't feel anything.
|-
!Angie
|He must have stopped.
|-
!Marco
|You think that's because he doesn't like me?
|-
!Angie
|I think his brain is the size of a grape. Which reminds me, I'm gonna eat a bag of grapes before we open presents. [runs off-screen, panting]
|-
!Marco
|Presents?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, it was in that invitation you didn't read.
|-
!
|''[[Charlie Booth]], disguised as Gustav, appears with a lot of baby presents.''
|-
!Rafael
|Oh, Gustav, you've outdone yourself again!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, my gosh. I didn't get a gift for Marco Jr. I'm a terrible big brother.
|-
!Star
|Shh-shh-shh-shh. Calm, Marco Sr. I know! Why don't we pop on over to [[Quest Buy (store)|Quest Buy]] and get him a little present?
|-
!Marco
|Quest Buy? I don't know.
|-
!Star
|Sure! Come on! [pulls Marco toward the front door]
|-
!Marco
|Whoa!
|-
!Angie
|[talking to Mrs. Morrison] Well, we were so lonely that we decided, "Hey, why not have a baby?" [sees Star and Marco leaving] Marco, where are you going?
|-
!Marco
|Uh, I'm gonna, uh, run out and grab some ice for the party.
|-
!Rafael
|But we have plenty of ice.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, but I'm gonna get fancy ice they harvest from a glacier.
|-
!Rafael
|Oooh! Glacier ice!
|-
!Angie
|Well, don't be gone too long. We'll be opening presents soon.
|-
!Marco
|No problemo! [leaves]
|-
!Rafael
|[tosses ice out of his cup] Get out of here, tap-water ice! You are not needed anymore!
|-
!Angie
|Are you... just gonna hold your drink until Marco gets back?
|-
!Rafael
|For glacier ice? I will wait.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Quest Buy.
|-
!Marco
|Seriously?! None of this stuff is safe for a baby!
|-
!Star
|How about Baby's First Hidden Poison Capsule?
|-
!
|''Star holds a pacifier that ejects a small cloud of poison.''
|-
!Star
|What's safer than not having enemies because you poisoned them all?!
|-
!Marco
|I am not giving the baby a pacifier filled with magic poison.
|-
!Star
|Well, there's always a gift card.
|-
!Gift Card
|You have 8.5 minutes until expiration. [shoots laser]
|-
!Goblin
|Aah! No! Aaah! Please! No!
|-
!Marco
|No. This gift has to be the perfect reminder of me since I might not be around much.
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Oh, I know!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to a sign that reads "Atelier de Cobalt Ferrero, Mewni's Quality Painter".''
|-
!Marco
|"Atelier de Cobalt Ferrero". He... works in the basement?
|-
!
|''Star and Marco go down to the Quest Buy basement, where various art supplies are scattered around.''
|-
!Star
|Mr. Ferrero?
|-
!Cobalt Ferrero
|What?
|-
!Star
|[kneels down next to Cobalt] Oh, your portraitness.
|-
!Cobalt
|Eh? What do ya want?
|-
!Star
|My friend Marco here wants one of your legendary portraits.
|-
!Cobalt
|[flies up to Marco] Is that right, Marco? [pokes Marco's face]
|-
!Marco
|Yeah. I'm starting to think this is a bad idea.
|-
!
|''As Marco walks away, he bumps into a portrait of [[Rich Pigeon]].''
|-
!Marco
|Oh! [[Rich Pigeon]]. Sorry, didn't see you there.
|-
!Star
|Uh, Marco, that's a portrait.
|-
!Marco
|What?!
|-
!Cobalt
|That piece? Not even finished yet.
|-
!Marco
|Wow! He's so real, I can almost smell him!
|-
!Cobalt
|That's just the perch he posed on.
|-
!
|''A nearby bird perch is covered in bird poop.''
|-
!Star
|That's "fowl"! Get it? 'Cause he's a bird.
|-
!Marco
|It's the perfect gift! A portrait that realistic, it's like I'll be there with my family even when I'm not!
|-
!Cobalt
|I know, I know. I'm very talented. But we got a lotta work to do before the painting begins. I have to study you closely. I have to live with you, breathe with you, eat a lock of your hair. The process takes weeks, maybe months.
|-
!Marco
|Can't you do something faster?
|-
!Cobalt
|No! I never compromise my work.
|-
!Marco
|[holding $650] 650 cash.
|-
!Cobalt
|Sold.
|-
!
|''Cobalt gives Marco an exam booklet and Scantron sheet.''
|-
!Cobalt
|You need one of these things.
|-
!Marco
|A Scantron?
|-
!Cobalt
|[gives Marco a pencil] And one of these.
|-
!Marco
|What? I don't have time for a pop quiz!
|-
!Cobalt
|It's an "Essence Test", wise guy. The abridged version of me studying you for months.
|-
!Marco
|"What kind of socks do you prefer with loafers? A: Tube socks. B: Ankle socks." How is this supposed to help with a portrait?! [sighs] Whatever. I don't have time for this. [humming]
|-
!
|''Marco quickly fills in bubbles on the Scantron sheet before finishing on question 200.''
|-
!Marco
|Uh, Mr. Ferrero? All done.
|-
!Cobalt
|[takes Scantron sheet] Let's make some art!
|-
!
|''Marco sees his reflection in Cobalt's good tooth.''
|-
!Marco
|Let's.
|-
!
|''Cobalt paints Marco's portrait on a canvas. The passage of time is indicated by a clock.
|-
!Marco
|[sitting on bird perch] C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Time's running out, and my legs are asleep!
|-
!
|''Cobalt snaps his fingers. His assistant elves give him Marco's Scantron sheet and a bowl. Cobalt squeezes black liquid out of the sheet and into the bowl. He dips his hands in the liquid and flings it at the painting before wiping his hands on one of the elves' hat.''
|-
!Cobalt
|Mwah! She's done.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to the Diaz Household. The Morrisons leave the Diazes' party.''
|-
!Mrs. Morrison
|Bye! Great party! And, uh, congratulations!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco return.''
|-
!Angie
|Marco, what took you so long? You missed the whole party.
|-
!Rafael
|Yes, and where is the glacier ice?
|-
!Marco
|What? Oh! Uh, they were all sold out... of it.
|-
!Rafael
|Oh. I see. [pours his juice on the ground]
|-
!Marco
|I know I'm not always here, so I got Marco Jr. this gift to make up for it.
|-
!Angie
|Aw, how sweet.
|-
!
|''Marco shows his parents the painting.''
|-
!Angie
|Aw, how nice. You got us a... [shocked] painting!
|-
!Rafael
|Ohhh!
|-
!Angie
|You paid money for that?
|-
!Marco
|What are you talking about? Whoa-ho-ho!
|-
!
|''Marco looks at the painting. It looks overly detailed and absolutely hideous; Marco has misaligned eyes, long nose with exaggerated nostrils, big mole, crooked smile, and long chin. He also has long clasped fingers.''
|-
!Marco
|What the heck?! This doesn't look like me at all!
|-
!Rafael
|It's like he got the proportions all wrong and then tried to fix it by adding more detail and more detail and more detail. But, Marco, it did not fix it.
|-
!Angie
|Well, it was a nice thought.
|-
!
|''Marco looks disappointed and ashamed. Scene cuts to house interior, where Star and the Diazes have dinner together. Marco has the same expression as in the previous scene.''
|-
!Rafael
|And then just as I take off Marco's diaper, he pee-pees all over my shirt!
|-
!Star
|[laughing]
|-
!Angie
|[laughing] I remember. C'mon, Marco, I thought you loved it when Dad told stories about when you were a baby.
|-
!Marco
|No, I'm fine.
|-
!Star
|Uh, Marco, what's that on your face?
|-
!Marco
|Huh? Oh. [wipes his face] Did I get it?
|-
!
|''When Marco moves his napkin away from his face, he suddenly has a longer chin.''
|-
!Star
|[stunned] Um... Yeah, no, no, not exactly.
|-
!Angie
|Marco?
|-
!
|''Marco blinks, and his eyes fall slightly out of alignment. He also has exaggerated eyebrows, eyelashes, and nostrils.''
|-
!Star
|Your face! It looks like... [gasps] It looks like the painting!
|-
!Marco
|Oh! Ha-ha, guys. I get it. The portrait stinks. But, you know, I was just trying to do something that Marco Jr. could remember me by when I was— [muffled]
|-
!
|''Marco's mouth suddenly freezes into a crooked smile.''
|-
!Marco
|[mumbling] [garbled] What's happening? What is happening?!
|-
!Star
|Oh, I knew it was a bad idea to rush a magical portrait!
|-
!Marco
|[mumbling angrily]
|-
!Angie
|Marco, don't use that kind of language at the table.
|-
!Marco
|[mumbles sadly]
|-
!Rafael
|Oh! Maybe if we destroy the painting, it will break the spell.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to outside the house.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Laser Beam Blast!
|-
!
|''Star's magic reduces the painting to ashes.''
|-
!Star
|Anything?
|-
!
|''Marco's face remains unchanged.''
|-
!Rafael
|I think it's getting worse?
|-
!Marco
|[mumbled] It's getting worse?!
|-
!Star
|Well, guess there's only one thing left to do.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to the Quest Buy basement. Cobalt Ferrero is painting a minotaur woman's portrait.''
|-
!Cobalt
|Very nice. Now if you could just turn your cheek a little to the—
|-
!Star
|Cobalt! Look what your painting did to Marco's face.
|-
!Marco
|[distressed mumbling]
|-
!Star
|It's getting worse!
|-
!Cobalt
|The painting is just a reflection of his answers in the Essence Test, and if there's any discrepancies, the painting will adjust you to match the portrait. No extra charge!
|-
!Star
|Okay, there's gotta be some way to fix this. We tried destroying the painting, but that didn't work.
|-
!Cobalt
|True art can never be destroyed. [chuckles] You'll need to take the Essence Test again, and you must answer the questions truthfully.
|-
!
|''Cobalt gives Marco another exam booklet, Scantron sheet, and pencil. Before Marco can grab the pencil, his fingers straighten and become rigid.''
|-
!Marco
|[mumbling]
|-
!
|''Marco picks up the pencil with his frozen hands, but he quickly drops it. He slowly picks it up again...''
|-
!Marco
|[muffled] I got it! What the...?!
|-
!
|''...but then his arms fold into a rigid clasped pose.''
|-
!Marco
|[whimpering]
|-
!Rafael
|Oh, no! He can't take the exam like that!
|-
!Angie
|C'mon! Don't worry, we'll take the test for you.
|-
!Rafael
|After all who understands the mind of a teenage boy better than his own parents?
|-
!Marco
|Mrmpf!
|-
!
|''Marco suddenly turns flat like a canvas.''
|-
!Rafael and Angie
|[screaming]
|-
!Cobalt
|[eating popcorn] He's becoming the canvas. You'd better hurry.
|-
!
|''Angie picks up Marco, moves him to the side of the table, and sits in his chair.''
|-
!Angie
|Okay! Question one: "Which do you prefer to ride? A: A bicycle. B: A unicycle. C: A tricycle. D: A dragoncyc—" Uh, what's a dragoncycle?
|-
!Rafael
|I don't know.
|-
!Angie
|Remember when Marco was little and had that red tricycle?
|-
!Rafael
|He loved that!
|-
!Angie
|That's it! The answer is C: tricycle!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco looking worriedly at each other. Star jumps onto the table in front of Angie.''
|-
!Star
|Mrs. Diaz, we don't have much time! We have to be really careful these answers are perfect!
|-
!Angie
|That's what we're doing! [straining] If you could get off the... sheet!
|-
!
|''Angie pulls the Scantron sheet out from under Star and accidentally smacks Rafael in the face with it.''
|-
!Rafael
|Ay!
|-
!Angie
|Sorry, dear.
|-
!Rafael
|I am not bleeding. It is okay.
|-
!Star
|That's great! [wrestling Scantron out of Angie's hands] But I don't know if your answers really capture the Marco of today.
|-
!Rafael
|Of course not. The Marco of today is very frightening.
|-
!Marco
|[whimpering]
|-
!Star
|No, I just mean he... he's grown up.
|-
!Angie
|Sure, but I know my own son.
|-
!Star
|Sorry, but the answer is D: dragoncycle.
|-
!Angie
|Marco?
|-
!Marco
|[muffled, sadly] Um... Uh-huh.
|-
!Angie
|Oh. I was wrong about my own son?
|-
!Rafael
|This is sad.
|-
!Angie
|Star, get this test done.
|-
!Star
|All right, let's do this thing! Okay. "How old are you? A: 0 to 15. B: 16 to 25. C: 26 to 35." [fills in answer C]
|-
!Angie
|Um...
|-
!Rafael
|Hmm...
|-
!Star
|You two have some catching up to do. Okay, "Have you ever worn a dress? A: Yes." "Do you prefer corn shakes or corn malts?" Malts, duh. Next question.
|-
!
|''Star fills in answers up to question 200.''
|-
!Star
|And... done!
|-
!
|''Star hurriedly gives the Scantron sheet to Cobalt, who squeezes black liquid out of it and pours it onto the portrait's ashes. Marco magically turns back to normal.''
|-
!Marco
|Huh?
|-
!Star
|[hugs Marco] Oh, Marco, you're beautiful again!
|-
!Marco
|Thanks, Star. [to his parents] Mom? Dad?
|-
!
|''Marco and his parents have a group hug.''
|-
!Angie
|I guess we have some catching up to do.
|-
!Rafael
|My beautiful son is all grown up!
|-
!Marco
|I should have visited more. I don't want Marco Jr. growing up without knowing who I am.
|-
!Angie
|Visit anytime, sweetie. I mean, those [[Dimensional scissors|scissors]] work both ways, right? Snip, snip?
|-
!Cobalt
|This is a beautiful family moment. And I just happen to be runnin' a special on family portraits.
|-
!Marco
|Uh... that'll be a no!
|-
