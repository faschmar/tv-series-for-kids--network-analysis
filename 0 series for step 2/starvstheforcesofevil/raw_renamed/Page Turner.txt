|''Scene opens in Star's room. Glossaryck is eating [[Cornritos]] corn chips with his feet.''
|-
![[Glossaryck]]
| [picks up a chip] Hmmmm... [throws it away, picks up another] Hmm...
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|[leaps out of her bed pillows] Ugh, just eat one already!
|-
!Glossaryck
|There's only ever one chip worth eating. Besides, if this is too boring, you could be practicing your magic.
|-
![[Laser puppies|Laser puppy]]
|Woof!
|-
!Star
|Fine! [walks to [[Magic Instruction Book|spell book]]] What are we learning today?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Why don't you pick one? Pick anything.
|-
!Star
|[gasps] And my [[Queen Butterfly|mom]] would be cool with that?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Yes, there's a lot I do that your mom isn't cool with.
|-
!Star
|Well, how cool would she be with... this?! [laughs evilly]
|-
!Glossaryck
|The table of contents? A thrilling choice.
|-
!Star
|Why is that in the middle? [flips to another page] Ehh?
|-
!Glossaryck
|[tosses chip at Star's head] Pedestrian.
|-
!Star
|[flips to another page] Ehh?
|-
!Glossaryck
|[tosses another chip at Star's head] Boring.
|-
!Laser Puppy
|[barks]
|-
!Glossaryck
|[laughs, holds up a chip] The perfect chip!
|-
!Star
|Ohohoho. What's this?!
|-
!
|''She shows Glossaryck the page. It's locked by magic blue chains and a skull. Ominous music plays.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, no-no-no. [takes spell book away from Star]
|-
!Star
|Hey! You said anything!
|-
!Glossaryck
|It's the most dangerous chapter in the book. It shouldn't even be in there. Your mom would totally freak out.
|-
!Star
|Okay, okay, you sold me! I wanna read that!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, I don't know Star. It could taint you.
|-
!Star
|[grabs Glossaryck's chip]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Perfect chip!
|-
!Star
|Unlock it.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Hostage-taking. Classic Butterfly.
|-
!Star
|Unlock it... or else. [brings chip to her mouth]
|-
!Glossaryck
|You wouldn't.
|-
!Star
|Ah-ah-ah... [moves her tongue precariously around the chip]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Okay, okay. [grabs the chip] Chip. [eats it]
|-
!Star
|Okay, so...
|-
!Glossaryck
|Yes, yes, but, um...
|-
!
|''Glossaryck pushes Star away from the book with a spell.''
|-
!Star
|Hey! This wasn't the deal!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, well, I'm so sorry. But you're without your bargaining chip.
|-
!Star
|Fine. I am standing here. Open it!
|-
!
|''Glossaryck pulls out a key and using his toe, inserts it into the skull. The skull falls to the floor.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Now, I'm going to show you for a split second.
|-
!
|''Star's eyes glimmer with excitement. Glossaryck starts turning the page, but then he starts buzzing like a pager. ''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Wha... Bureaucracy of Magic? [picks up the call, puts his finger to his ear] Yes, this is he. Uh, this is...
|-
!Star
|Tell 'em you're busy.
|-
!Glossaryck
|...kind of a bad time.
|-
!Star
|Tell 'em you're busy.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Are you listening to me? This is...
|-
!Star
|You're busy right now.
|-
!Glossaryck
|... not a good time. This is the ''worst'' time. Star, I'll be right back.
|-
!Star
|Just hang up.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Don't turn the page.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck's eyes turn black. He shrieks as he falls into a starry universe inside himself. Star peers in through his eyes.''
|-
!Star
|Uh, Glossaryck?
|-
!
|''Glossaryck continues to scream as he falls. Scene changes to outside a tower. A security guard (Sean) munches some Cornritos chips. Glossaryck slams into the front door, still screaming.''
|-
!Sean
|Oh, hi, Mr. Glossaryck, sir.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Sean. Oh.
|-
!Sean
|[picking up Glossaryck] Sorry. The transporter's on the fritz today. [dusts off Glossaryck] But there's free muffins in the lobby.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Look, Sean, I was in the middle of something, and it was of ultra cosmic importance.
|-
!Sean
|Yeah, but you see, the [[Magic High Commission]] wants to see you too, and...
|-
!Glossaryck
|[laughs angrily]
|-
!Sean
|Uh, is everything alright?
|-
!Glossaryck
|[mocking] I don't know. Is everything alright? Did you get on the right flight? Are you running late? Are you cracked? Are you confused? Are you mad? [blubbers unintelligently]
|-
!Sean
|Oh, Mr. Glossaryck, you're so crazy. But you still have to go up and see the Magic High Commission.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Hand me your radio.
|-
!
|''Sean hands over the radio, and a loud air horn blast knocks him back.''
|-
!Sean
|Radio's on the fritz, too. You're gonna have to go up.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh. Very well.
|-
!Sean
|Great. Up the elevator, all the way to the top.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck tries to float inside.''
|-
!Sean
|Wait, wait, wait! [slams door closed] No magic in the building. You'll have to walk.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Fine. [floats to the ground]
|-
!Sean
|Have a magical day.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck sprints out of sight, and the door closes. The scene changes back to Star.''
|-
!Star
|Glossaryck?
|-
!
|''She taps him; he simply dangles lifelessly in mid air.''
|-
!Star
|[spins Glossaryck around] Glossaryck, Glossaryck, Glossaryck? He is not waking up. Time to call Mom.
|-
![[Interdimensional mirror|Mirror]]
|''Calling Mom.''
|-
!
|''Star's eyes glance at the spell book across the room, the forbidden chapter in sight.''
|-
!Star
|Uh, never mind. [closes mirror curtains]
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Glossaryck.''
|-
!Sean
|Please step through the magical detection machine.
|-
!
|''A wizard carrying many artifacts jumps in front of Glossaryck.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, come on!
|-
!Sean
|Are you carrying any articles of magic, sorcery, or occult objects of a mystical nature?
|-
!Wizard
|Uh... no.
|-
!Sean
|Just step this way please.
|-
!
|''The machine flashes green.''
|-
!Sean
|Thank you. Okay, Mr. Glossaryck. Your turn.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck runs through, setting off an alarm.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Wait, hold on. Are you kidding? That other guy just walked right through.
|-
!Sean
|Technology, right? I miss the simpler days.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck removes all of his belongings.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|I think we're done here.
|-
!Sean
|Have a magical...
|-
!
|''The alarm goes off again. Scene jump-cuts; Glossaryck is being searched.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Sean, work with me please. Cosmic ultra importance.
|-
!
|''Sean holds a scanner to Glossaryck's body. It sounds an alarm when held over Glossaryck's gemstone embedded in his head.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|That stays with me. [takes off] Hello! Hold the elevator!
|-
!
|''Glossaryck jumps into the elevator as the door closes, which squishes him, but he still squeezes through.''
|-
!Sean
|Oh, hey, Mr. Glossaryck. Which floor?
|-
!Glossaryck
|We've done this. Top floor.
|-
!
|''Sean pushes the elevator's top floor button, but nothing happens.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Uh, what's going on? The elevator's not moving.
|-
!Sean
|Uh, elevator's on the fritz too. Sorry. But there's muffins in the lobby.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Which part of "cosmic ultra importance" do you not understand?
|-
!
|''Glossaryck moves Sean out of the way and pushes the top button until it lights up. Unfortunately, all the other buttons light up as well.''
|-
!Wizard
|Now we have to stop on every floor! [laughs maniacally]
|-
!
|''Glossaryck jumps out of the elevator just before the doors closes.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Sean! Stairs!
|-
!
|''Sean points the way, and Glossaryck opens up a door to reveal a spiraling tower of stairs. He sighs, then magically beefs up his legs and starts sprinting. The scene changes back to Star.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Hey Star, check it out. I'm getting my first chest hair. It's pretty small, but if you look at it in just the right light... [sees Glossaryck] Uh, Glossaryck? [pokes him] What's up with him?
|-
!Star
|[in front of spell book] He's on the fritz.
|-
!Marco
|Wait a sec. Are you doing something you're not supposed to?
|-
!Star
|Glossaryck said not to turn the page. But he didn't say ''you'' couldn't...
|-
!
|''Scene changes back to Glossaryck. He is still running up stairs. He reaches the top floor, only to open the door and end up back on the first floor.''
|-
!Sean
|Stairs are on the fritz too. [laughs]
|-
!Glossaryck
|[growls angrily, eyes lighting up with magic]
|-
!Sean
|Now, now, Mr. Glossaryck. N-No magic in the building.
|-
!
|''A blast destroys the "No Magic" sign. Glossaryck holds his arms out, light envelops around him, and suddenly, the first floor smashes its way up the tower to the top. Glossaryck opens a pair of double doors and floats to one side of a table. [[Hekapoo]], [[Lekmet]], [[Rhombulus]], and [[Omnitraxus Prime]] sit on the other side.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|You're probably wondering why you're here.
|-
!
|''An office chair rolls up behind Glossaryck.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Children, the only thing I wonder is why you waste my time.
|-
!Rhombulus
|[jumps on top of the table] Don't call me children! ''You're'' the children! I've got chest diamonds bigger than you!
|-
!
|''Rhombulus's snake arms sizzle with magical energy.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Rhombulus...
|-
!Glossaryck
|Rhombulus, you still mad about my last visit?
|-
!
|''Rhombulus encases Glossaryck inside a crystal. The crystal doesn't last long though, as it quickly cracks open.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|[yawns] Excuse me, sorry. Don't mean to be rude. Getting stronger though, huh? That's good.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Gah. You always do this!
|-
!
|''Rhombulus picks up the table and throws it outside, shattering the glass wall. He then attempts to attack Glossaryck. Glossaryck shines his forehead gemstone, and Rhombulus backs away and shoots crystals at him.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Now you bring me here... while I'm at work... [punches Rhombulus into a wall] ...doing my job...!
|-
!
|''Glossaryck projects a giant hammer with his forehead gem and is about to strike Rhombulus.''
|-
!Queen Butterfly
|Yes, Glossaryck.
|-
!
|''The fighting immediately ends.''
|-
!Queen
|That's exactly what we're here to talk about.
|-
!Glossaryck
|[bows to Queen Butterfly] My liege.
|-
!
|''Sean sets up another table and slides it over to Magic High Commission.''
|-
!Queen
|The Commission has discovered a problem. Something somewhere is sapping the power of magic from the universe.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Yes, that would explain the fritz.
|-
!Rhombulus
|[sitting in the corner] Oh, that's what I've been saying!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Hey! The time-out corner is not on the fritz!
|-
!Rhombulus
|Stupid Glossaryck. Stupid time-out.
|-
!Queen
|Omnitraxus has been searching for the leak's cause. Omnitraxus, what have you learned?
|-
!Omnitraxus
|[muffles inside his sphere]
|-
!Queen
|Hello? Omni? Can you hear me?
|-
!Rhombulus
|Check the inputs!
|-
!Hekapoo
|You, out!
|-
!Rhombulus
|[leaving the room] Yeah, whatever. I'll crystallize myself. Would you miss me? No.
|-
!
|''Lekmet pushes buttons on a VCR like machine below Omnitraxus. The sphere cycles through various images, including [[Toffee]], before stopping on a tomato can. Lekmet starts bleating and drooling.''
|-
!Queen
|Well, whatever's causing it, I want everyone to be on their toes. Especially Star. I need you to accelerate her training.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Yeah... no.
|-
!Queen
|Why all the riddles? You were always very direct when you were training me.
|-
!Glossaryck
|[sighs] Well, it finally happened. Every queen wants to tell me how to do my job. "My training was different." You know what Glossaryck hears? Me, me, me, me, me! "I'm going to pull my mentor away from his job so I can be in the spotlight again." The only Butterfly to leave me be was your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother, [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa the Queen of Darkness]], whose chapter, coincidentally, you left Star alone with when you pulled me into this wonderland of red tape.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck smacks on Omnitraxus Prime. The sphere reveals Star and Marco.''
|-
!Star
|Turn the page! turn the page!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, I'm gonna turn the page!
|-
!Star
|Turn the page!
|-
!Marco
|I'm gonna turn the page!
|-
!Star
|[singing] Turn the page, Marco!
|-
!
|''The High Commission shrieks/bleats.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|You all did this because you don't trust me, and what's worse, you don't trust Star. My queen. My queen, your training was different because Star is different. You have to have faith in her to make choices that are best for her. And my job is to train Star to be a queen.
|-
!
|''The queen nods, and her frown turns into a smile. Glossaryck's essence leaves the meeting and reappears in his body back in Star's room.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh!
|-
!
|''Star is reading the spell book at her desk.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|So?
|-
!Star
|Yeah.
|-
!Glossaryck
|You read the whole thing?
|-
!Star
|Yeah...
|-
!Glossaryck
|And?
|-
!Star
|It wasn't all that. I mean, I get it. Power of darkness, forces of evil, eternal suffering, blah-blah-blah. But honestly, didn't really affect me that much. Just wasn't my thing.
|-
!Glossaryck
|[to himself] Yes!
|-
!Star
|But Marco, on the other hand...
|-
!
|''Marco floats in the middle of a purple vortex of dark magic, his eyes completely black.''
|-
!Star
|Yikes.
|-
!Marco
|[mutters evilly]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Luckily, there's a spell to fix that.
