|-
![[Spider With a Top Hat (character)|Spider With a Top Hat]]
|Whee! Pancakes! [lands on table] Ahem. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the 10th biweekly Pancake Day!
|-
!Spells
|[cheering]
|-
!Spider
|Hey! Looking good, Greg. Hey, Susan, don't eat that all at once. And Glowworm, may I say you're looking particularly glowy today?
|-
!Glowworm
|Yeah, I've been hitting the gym.
|-
!Spider
|Well, whatever you're doing, keep it up.
|-
!Richard the One-Eyed Narwhal
|Yeah, Billy-boy, watch your papa show you how it's really done. First, you got to slather on some good old-fashioned maple syrup.
|-
!
|''Minotaur grabs the syrup bottle before Richard and squirts a large amount on his pancakes.''
|-
!Minotaur
|[strains] You... can have some... [yells] ...when I'm done with it. Here!
|-
!
|''Minotaur gives the syrup bottle back to Richard completely empty.''
|-
!Billy
|Aww.
|-
!Richard
|Don't you worry, Billy-boy. Daddy's gonna find you some syrup. Hey, Spider! Can you get some syrup for my kid?
|-
!Spider
|[talking to Dave the Flying Pig] So then I say, "That's not a pencil. That's a pen!"
|-
!Spider and Dave
|[laugh]
|-
!Richard
|Slacking on the job, huh? Guess I got to do everything around here. Hey, Spider. Hey, Dave.
|-
!Dave
|[sighs] Richard. [flies away]
|-
!Spider
|What can I do for you on this glorious Pancake Day?
|-
!Richard
|Well, my kid needs syrup, but we're all out.
|-
!Spider
|Out of syrup? Hmm. I'm afraid that was our last batch.
|-
!
|''There's a loud pounding at the door, and several spells burst into the room: Low Self-Esteem Nightmare Dream (a floating head with two-colored hair and two mouths), Ourobors (a snake eating its own tail), Goth Moth (a moth with skulls on its wings), Pyro Pony (a bipedal horse with no head), Hypnoslumber (a black cloud with a lightning bolt sticking out from under it), Void Cat (a one-eyed cat that comes up through the floor), and a spell with no eyes, a mouth, and several thorny tentacles).
|-
!Rock the Warnicorn
|[[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]'s spells!
|-
!Richard
|What are they doing out of their room?
|-
!Spider
|Now, now, let's not jump to conclusions here. Maybe they just want some pancakes.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa's spells spread out around the room.''
|-
!Spider
|Hey, good morning, gang. We're having pancakes. W-We're working on the syrup thing. We don't have any – that's a bit of a problem, but—
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|Perimeter secure. Kill the lights. [blasts a lamp made of crystal to pieces]
|-
!Spider
|Oh, boy.
|-
!
|''Pyro Pony breaks another lamp and pushes over the soda machine. Hypnoslumber blasts a chandelier on the ceiling, and it shatters on the floor.''
|-
!Spider
|Okay, that's it!
|-
!
|''As Nightmare Dream blasts more of the luminescent lights, Spider appears before her, dangling from the ceiling.''
|-
!Spider
|Hey there, buddy. Now, I know you're the new queen's spells, but you can't just go around wrecking other spells' rooms.
|-
!
|''Nightmare Dream tries getting around Spider, but Spider keeps cutting her off from floating away.''
|-
!Spider
|Now, whatever problem you're having, I'm sure we can find a perfectly good solution—
|-
!
|''Nightmare Dream blasts Spider with the spell she's named for.''
|-
!Spider
|Aah!
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|Out of my way!
|-
!Rest of Star's Spells
|[gasp] Spider!
|-
!Spider
|[groaning]
|-
!Richard
|Spider, you okay?
|-
!Spider
|Oh. Y-Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. Just had a little misunderstanding back there. [chuckles] Of course, that was probably all my fault. I'm always screwing everything up. [pulls top hat down over his face]
|-
!Makeup Blast
|Oh, no. They took his self-esteem.
|-
!Richard
|Cool. So, uh... you're still going to talk to them, right?
|-
!Makeup Blast
|[gasps] They're coming back!
|-
!
|''Richard, Makeup Blast, and Spider hide behind a sideways table. Hypnoslumber knocks over the last source of light in the room and blasts it.''
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|Okay, that's the last of them. Now, let's find that glowworm.
|-
!
|''Glowworm hides behind a stack of pancakes.''
|-
!Glowworm
|[whimpering]
|-
!
|''Hypnoslumber rises from behind Glowworm and blasts him to sleep. Void Cat ties up Glowworm to a stick and rope. Nightmare Dream carries Glowworm around the room in search of something.''
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|All clear. Not here.
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|All right, you heard them. Next room. Time's of the essence, people.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa's spells leave with Glowworm.''
|-
!Makeup Blast
|Wait. They took Wormy! Someone should go after them!
|-
!Spider
|I-I-I'll save him. Except I'll probably just make it worse. [crying] Oh, why do I bother doing anything?
|-
!Makeup Blast
|You're in no condition to go out there. One of us will go instead, like.. Narwhal!
|-
!Richard
|Hmm?
|-
!Makeup Blast
|(''o.s.'') Why don't you go?
|-
!Richard
|What? M-Me? W-Why? I—
|-
!Makeup Blast
|Aren't you Spider's best friend?
|-
!Richard
|I mean, we hang out occasionally, but...
|-
!Flying Snail
|(''o.s.'') You guys hang out all the time.
|-
!Dave
|Yeah, you're always chatting it up at the lunch tables.
|-
!Rich
|Didn't you guys plan a road trip together?
|-
!Flying Snail
|Uh, isn't he godfather to your children?
|-
!Richard
|Yeah, but who ''isn't'' a godfather to a kids?
|-
!Dave
|Shame on you, Richard.
|-
!Richard
|Fine. I'll go. [floats out into the hallway]
|-
!Dave
|Quick, shut the door!
|-
!
|''The doors into Star's spells' room suddenly close shut behind Richard.
|-
!Richard
|Huh? What? [sighs] Huh?
|-
!
|''In a circular hallway, Richard sees multiple doors leading into the rooms of the past [[Mewni]] queens' spells.''
|-
!Richard
|Whoa. I have got to get out more. I-I didn't even know we had this many queens.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa's spells come out of the room of [[Celena Butterfly]]'s spells.
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|We're all clear! Let's move.
|-
!Richard
|Wait! [follows Eclipsa]]'s spells]
|-
!
|''The spells stand outside [[Moon Butterfly|Moon]]'s spells' room.''
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|All right, on my mark. Three, two, one—!
|-
!Richard
|Hey, I don't want to interrupt, but could I get that little glowworm back?
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|Sir, what is that sound coming out of your face? The real spells are working here.
|-
!
|''Hypnoslumber opens the doors. Moon's spells are having a tea party.''
|-
!Spell 1
|Ahem. May I help you?
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|[blasts the lights]
|-
!Spell 1
|Aah!
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|Scan the room.
|-
!
|''Nightmare Dream searches the room using Glowworm like a flashlight.''
|-
!Spell 2
|Do you mind?
|-
!Spell 1
|What, were you born in a barn?
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|All clear. Let's keep moving.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa's spells proceed to the next room.''
|-
!Richard
|Uh, so about, uh... [groans] I'm missing pancakes because of this. [follows Eclipsa's spells] Can't you just give back my little buddy? Come on.
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|Sir, go back to your cake party. Your worm friend will be returned to you at the end of the mission.
|-
!Richard
|Oh, really? Well, that's—
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|If he survives.
|-
!Richard
|What? Hey, what do you mean by—?
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|There's movement up ahead!
|-
!
|''Nightmare Dream shines Glowworm on a small, black, skull-shaped butterfly.''
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|We have a visual! Formation Indigo Indigo Waning Moon!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa's spells follow behind the skull butterfly. It phases through the wall, leaving behind cracks and a butterfly-shaped burn.''
|-
!Richard
|That spell is intense.
|-
!Pyro Pony
|That's Eclipsa's most powerful spell. It don't even have a name.
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|Ouroboros, get the containment unit ready.
|-
!
|''Ouroboros pulls a glass jar out of its mouth.''
|-
!Ouroboros
|Locked and loaded, sir.
|-
!Richard
|Whoa, what is that thing?
|-
!Pyro Pony
|It's a dark magic containment cylinder. Best in the business.
|-
!Richard
|It looks like a pickle jar.
|-
!Pyro Pony
|Yeah. Yeah, it is a pickle jar.
|-
!Ouroboros
|Pickle jars work great, as long as you don't knock it off the shelf!
|-
!Void Cat
|Knocking stuff over is super fun, "Mom"!
|-
!
|''Ouroboros wraps itself around Void Cat, and the two phase down through the floor. The spell with tentacles flies out with Goth Moth on its back. It flings its thorns at the Spell With No Name, but the Spell With No Name dodges them. The tentacle spell and Goth Moth crash into the wall, and the Spell With No Name flies away.''
|-
!Tentacle Spell
|Follow the target! Don't let it out of the light!
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|Roger!
|-
!
|''Nightmare Dream follows the Spell With No Name with Glowworm's light. Void Cat and Ouroboros leap out several times to catch it in the jar, but it dodges every time. It also dodges more thorns flung at it.'' 
|-
!Richard
|[to Pyro Pony] So, when are ''you'' gonna spring into action?
|-
!Pyro Pony
|Me? I'm not doin' nothin'. On account I'm a weenie and I don't have a head. Yeah! Go get them, boys!
|-
!
|''Ouroboros flings the jar at Hypnoslumber, who supercharges the jar with lightning and shoots it toward the Spell With No Name. The jar catches the spell and lands on the floor face-down.''
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|Self-Esteem, get a light on this!
|-
!
|''Nightmare Dream shines Glowworm's light on the jar. It's empty.''
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|What the—?! The target is still at large. I want another perimeter sweep right now.
|-
!Other Spells
|[looking stunned] Uh... Uh...
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|What
|-
!
|''The Spell With No Name appears behind Hypnoslumber.''
|-
!Richard
|That spell! It's...! It's...!
|-
!Hypnoslumber
|It's what? Speak up!
|-
!
|''The Spell With No Name phases through Hypnoslumber. Hypnoslumber hardens like rock and disintegrates into dust, leaving behind a brief aftereffect of butterfly-shaped smoke.''
|-
!Other Spells
|[scream]
|-
!
|''The rest of the spells run around in a panic. When Nightmare Dream slams into a wall, Glowworm slams into it as well, causing his light to go out.''
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|Oh, no! Oh, no-no-no-no-no!
|-
!
|''Nightmare Dream regroups with Ouroboros, Pyro Pony, and Richard in the circular hallway.''
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|Where'd the others go? Where's Void Cat? Where is Goth Moth?
|-
!Pyro Pony
|It's just us now.
|-
!Richard
|What was that?! What happened to Hypnoslumber?!
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|That's what that spell does. One touch, and your days are numbered.
|-
!Pyro Pony
|What do you think happened to my head?! [wails]
|-
!Richard
|I didn't know it was gonna be like this!
|-
!
|''Nightmare Dream tosses Glowworm to the ground next to Richard.''
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|Your friend is no use to us without his glow light. You may as well take him now.
|-
!Pyro Pony
|Yeah, yeah, just go home to that little cake party or whatever.
|-
!Richard
|But what are you guys gonna do without the glowworm light?
|-
!Ouroboros
|Don't worry about that. We have a plan B.
|-
!Richard
|Oh! Well, that's a relief. I'll show myself out. [floats away with Glowworm]
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|Do you have the device?
|-
!Ouroboros
|Yup.
|-
!
|''Ouroboros reaches into his mouth and pulls out a magical bomb.''
|-
!Ouroboros
|One press of this button, and this whole place goes sky-high.
|-
!Richard
|[stops floating away] Wait, what did you just say? Y-You... You can't just blow up the whole dimension! My kid still needs to eat his pancakes!
|-
!Ouroboros
|You know what happens if we don't catch that thing? First we die. Then everyone dies. It'll eat its way through every dimension until there's nothing left.
|-
!Richard
|But there has to be another way! All the other spells—!
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|We spells were created to serve the queens of Mewni. If we have to sacrifice ourselves to keep them safe, so be it.
|-
!
|''Richard drops Glowworm in shock.''
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|This is it, fellas. Any last words?
|-
!Ouroboros
|[tearing up] I just want to say, you guys are the best teammates a spell could ask for. I love you guys.
|-
!Richard
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''In Richard's point of view, the Spell With No Name appears behind Ouroboros.''
|-
!Pyro Pony
|Aw, Ouro. I love you, too.
|-
!Richard
|[whispering] Uh... Guys? Behind you!
|-
!Eclipsa's Spells
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Eclipsa's spells look in the Spell With No Name's direction, but they don't see anything.''
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|Uh, what are we supposed to be looking at here?
|-
!Richard
|The... The spell! It's right on top of you!
|-
!
|''The Spell With No Name flies around the spells' vicinity.''
|-
!Richard
|Watch out! Don't make any sudden movements!
|-
!Pyro Pony
|Hey, is this kid playing some kind of trick on us?
|-
!Richard
|There it goes!
|-
!
|''The Spell With No Name flies off into another part of the hallway.''
|-
!Richard
|Seriously, did none of you see that?!
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|No. How could we? You can only see the spell using the glow light.
|-
!Ouroboros
|Uh, what do you think we were using your friend for?
|-
!Richard
|I don't need to see it to know where it is! I have echolocation! [realizing] ...Hey. I have echolocation. Guys, I can fix this!
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|What?
|-
!Ouroboros
|You can?
|-
!Richard
|Follow me!
|-
!Eclipsa's Spells
|[follow Richard]
|-
!Richard
|Okay, here's the plan. I'll go in there and chase the spell out with my magic. You still got that pickle jar?
|-
!
|''Ouroboros puts the magic bomb back in his body and takes out the jar.''
|-
!Ouroboros
|Right here. But are you sure about this?
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|Yeah, there's no way you're strong enough to take that thing on your own.
|-
!Richard
|Oh, I'm definitely not strong enough. But when all else fails, a narwhal's got to step up. [inhales deeply] Oh, boy, I really don't want to do this.
|-
!
|''Richard goes down the same hallway the Spell With No Name went. When he sees the spell with his echolocation, Richard chases it into the pitch-black darkness. Richard blasts energy beams from his horn at the Spell multiple times.''
|-
!Pyro Pony
|Dang. You know he could do this?
|-
!Richard
|Okay, I got him on the run! Get that pickle jar ready!
|-
!Ouroboros
|But where am I aiming it?!
|-
!Richard
|Just point it directly at me!
|-
!Ouroboros
|Uh, roger that!
|-
!Richard
|Here it comes!
|-
!
|''Richard's energy beam pushes the Spell With No Name in the direction of Eclipsa's spells. When the spell flies into the jar, Pyro Pony covers it with the lid.''
|-
!Nightmare Dream
|Did you get it? Narwhal, get your eyes on this.
|-
!
|''Using his echolocation, Richard sees the Spell With No Name inside the jar.''
|-
!Richard
|Yeah... We got it... [falls unconscious]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to some time later in Star's spells' room. Everyone is gathered around Glowworm, who has bandages on his butt.''
|-
!Glowworm
|[laughs] Check out my little bandage butt!
|-
!Cupcake 1
|Oh, where'd you get that?
|-
!Glowworm
|Beats me. I guess I took a tumble somewhere.
|-
!Cupcake 2
|Hey, Narwhal, couldn't you bring him back in one piece?
|-
!Richard
|Sorry about that.
|-
!Warnicorn 2
|You did good, kid, bringing Glowworm back all by yourself.
|-
!Richard
|Well, somebody had to do it, right?
|-
!Octocorn
|Oh, and guess what? We found more syrup.
|-
!Narwhal
|Turns out Spider was hoarding a secret stash in the basement.
|-
!
|''Several warnicorns are hugging and licking crates of maple syrup.''
|-
!Warnicorn 3
|Blessed be this luscious bounty of sunlight and nectar!
|-
!Spider
|[crying] It's true! I'm a liar! There's always syrup! There's never no syrup! I'm so sorry!
|-
!Makeup Blast
|It's okay.
|-
!Spider
|Is it really?
|-
!Makeup Blast
|Kind of iffy. But now we have infinite syrup. That's a good problem to have.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa's spells start to leave.''
|-
!Makeup Blast
|Hey, Eclipsa's spells. Y'all want some pancakes?
|-
!Ouroboros
|Nah, we don't want to hang out with you kids. Eat your pancakes.
|-
!Pyro Pony
|Catch you on the flippity-flop.
|-
!Makeup Blast
|Well, they sure are friendly. Anyway, back to syrup.
|-
!Rock
|I vote we pour it in a giant tub and swim around in it!
|-
!
|''As the rest of Star's spells walk off-screen, Richard stares at Eclipsa's spells as they leave. Using his echolocation, he stares with worry at the Spell With No Name in the jar until the doors close.''
|-
