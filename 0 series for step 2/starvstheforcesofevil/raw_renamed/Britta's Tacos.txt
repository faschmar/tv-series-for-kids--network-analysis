|''Episode begins at the [[Britta's Tacos]] fast food restaurant. Several [[Echo Creek]] citizens are seen hanging around the restaurant eating food. [[Star Butterfly]], [[Marco Diaz|Marco]], [[Mariposa Diaz|Mariposa]], and [[Cloudy]] arrive at Britta's Tacos. Marco is carrying Mariposa in a baby carrier, and Cloudy is carrying Mariposa's baby supplies.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|And this, [[Mariposa Diaz|Mariposa]], is Britta's Tacos.
|-
![[Mariposa Diaz]]
|[blowing raspberries]
|-
!Star
|No, no, no, no, no. It's pronounced "tacos". "Ta-cos". I had trouble with it, too.
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|I am so pumped! All I need is 50 more punches on my Frequent Eater card, then I'll win... the mystery prize!
|-
!Star
|[gasps] I hope it's a T-shirt!
|-
!Marco
|For 200 tacos, it'd better be a lot cooler than a T-shirt.
|-
!Star
|I think it's a shirt.
|-
!Marco
|All right, Mariposa. I got your bottles, your teddy, and your diaper bag.
|-
!Star
|So what are we doing today, besides eatin' tacos?
|-
!Marco
|Do? Summers are all about relaxin' and doing nothin'.
|-
!Star
|Ohhh, okay. [slumps onto restaurant table] After the year I've had, nothin' is all I wanna do.
|-
!Marco
|I'm gonna get some tacos.
|-
!Star
|Tacos sound good. [straining] Cloudyyyyyyy!
|-
!
|''Star summons Cloudy next to her.''
|-
![[Cloudy]]
|Aaah!
|-
!
|''Star rides on top of Cloudy to the restaurant counter. [[Sensei Brantley]] and [[Oskar Greason]] appear before them as Britta's Tacos employees.''
|-
![[Sensei Brantley]]
|Welcome to Britta's Tacos.
|-
!Marco
|Sensei?
|-
!Star
|And Oskar!
|-
![[Oskar Greason]]
|Hey.
|-
!Marco
|What are you doing here?
|-
!Sensei
|Dude, I've been working here for the last six months. But you'd know that if you hadn't just up and left. I see you're a dad now. Figures.
|-
!Oskar
|Classic Mango.
|-
!Star
|Classic Mango.
|-
!Marco
|Dude, this is... this is my sister.
|-
!Sensei
|Ooh, I get it. You're hiding it from [[Jackie Lynn Thomas|Jackie]]. Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
|-
!Marco
|I'm not hiding anything. This IS my sister. A-And even if she wasn't, there's no drama between me and Jackie.
|-
!Sensei
|[winks at Marco and gives him a thumbs-up]
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] Can I just get 10 tacos?
|-
!Oskar
|[to Star] Hey, weren't we supposed to hang out, like, last summer?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, guess so. Whatcha been up to?
|-
!Oskar
|I got a job at Britta's Tacos.
|-
!Star
|Niiiice.
|-
!
|''Sensei gives Marco a bag of tacos and uses a hole puncher to punch holes in his "Tacos Frequent Eater" card.''
|-
!Marco
|If I just pace myself, I should have no problem knocking back all 50 tacos today.
|-
!
|''Marco unwraps one of the tacos and eats it. Some of the taco meat falls on Mariposa's head.''
|-
!Marco
|[strained] That's four down. Ugh, it's gonna be a long day.
|-
!Star
|Why don't you just have someone else eat them?
|-
!
|''Star summons a kitty cat with a spinning tail.''
|-
!Star
|All you need are the punches.
|-
!Marco
|Oh-ho-ho-ho, yeah!
|-
!
|''Two bodybuilders are placing an order to Sensei.''
|-
!Bodybuilder 1
|Five ''lengua'' tacos, extra ''lengua''.
|-
!Marco
|Uh, excuse me. Could I have your punches?
|-
!Bodybuilders
|All right, kid! [about to punch Marco]
|-
!Marco
|No, no, no, no, no! Your Loyalty Card punches. I'm trying to get the mystery prize.
|-
!Bodybuilder 2
|I dunno, man. I really wanna punch you.
|-
!Marco
|C'mon, guys. Can you say no to this? [holds up Mariposa]
|-
!Mariposa
|[babbles]
|-
!Bodybuilder 1
|Whoa! How could I say no to the father of such a cute baby?
|-
!Marco
|Father? Oh, no, I'm, uh... [sighs] Never mind.
|-
!
|''Sensei punches more holes in Marco's card with the hole puncher.''
|-
!Marco
|Ohhhh-ho-ho-ho-ho! That mystery prize is as good as mine!
|-
!
|''[[Principal Skeeves]], [[Mr. Candle]], and [[Miss Skullnick]]  appear at the restaurant counter.''
|-
![[Principal Skeeves]]
|[to Sensei] So you mean to tell me, I can't get apple slices with my que-sa-dill-a?!
|-
!Star
|Teachers? Oh, no, no, no, no! I just ditched an entire year of school while we were in [[Mewni]]! Push me under the table, Marco!
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!Star
|Just do it!
|-
!Marco
|Okay! Geez! [pushes Star under the table]
|-
!Skeeves
|Well, well, well, Mr. Diaz. Getting along well without an education?
|-
!Marco
|Uh-uh-uh-uh!
|-
!
|''Marco slaps his "High School Equivalency Diploma" on the table in front of Principal Skeeves.''
|-
!Marco
|Read it and weep! I got my diploma and everything.
|-
!
|''Marco's diploma gets greasy and slightly see-through from all the taco grease on the table.''
|-
!Marco
|Ewww!
|-
![[Mr. Candle]]
|Oh, no. Put that official business away, Marco. It's summer.
|-
!Marco
|Crandle?! Did you, uh, follow me from Mewni?!
|-
!Mr. Candle
|I don't know what a Mewni is. I'm just here in Echo Creek helping kids find their lifelong posts. [stutters] Careers. Good lifelong careers.
|-
!Skeeves
|[slaps Marco on the back] Relax, my boy! It's summer!
|-
!Marco
|Well, since everything is cool, can I have your punches?
|-
!Skeeves
|Yeah, sure!
|-
!Mr. Candle
|Okey-dokey.
|-
!
|''As Marco, Skeeves, and Mr. Candle walk off-screen, [[StarFan13]] appears in the bushes near Star and Marco's table.''
|-
!Star
|[laughs] I'm never going to school.
|-
![[StarFan13]]
|[breathing heavily] Star!
|-
!Star
|Aaaah!
|-
!
|''StarFan drags Star into a spinning hug.''
|-
!StarFan13
|I thought you'd never come back to me! Selfie! [takes selfie with Star] And pout! [takes another selfie] Now smolder! [takes another selfie]
|-
!Star
|If we're gonna do this, Mama needs a horchata. Marco! Earth money!
|-
!StarFan13
|[sees Marco and Mariposa] Whoa! Nice baby!
|-
!Marco
|Thanks.
|-
!StarFan13
|[takes picture of Mariposa] I'm posting this right now! Wait. Oh, Marco, is it cool if I post this? You know, because Jackie might see it.
|-
!Marco
|Uh, yeah, of course. Why not?
|-
!StarFan13
|Some people get really awkward when they run into an ex. You know, it's, like, drama! [accidentally drops Star on the ground] Oh! Oops! [picks up Star] It could get really weird.
|-
!Marco
|Everything's totally great between Jackie and me. No weirdness here!
|-
!StarFan13
|Oh, that's good. 'Cause it's Taco Tuesday. Jackie always comes to Taco Tuesdays.
|-
!Marco
|[puts Mariposa down on Cloudy] Well, I look forward to seeing her. I gotta go to the bathroom.
|-
!
|''Marco enters the public restroom and splashes his face with water.''
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] What does StarFan know? It's not gonna be weird to see Jackie. We're friends.
|-
!
|''A grown man with the same hairstyle as Marco's pops up from inside the bathroom stall behind Marco.
|-
!Man
|I thought me and my ex were cool. But last year, I ran into her at this very taco stand. It was terrifying! And she threatened to squeeze hot sauce into my eye! And I've been hiding out in this here stall ever since.
|-
!Marco
|Well, that's you, man. Jackie and I – we had a healthy relationship.
|-
!Man
|Yeah? Well, why'd you break up then?
|-
!Marco
|Oh. Well, you know, 'cause she thought I was in love with... my best friend.
|-
!Man
|Oh, brah, that's, like, way worse than what I did!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, no... I was a terrible boyfriend.
|-
!
|''From outside the bathroom, StarFan13 pounds on the door.''
|-
!StarFan13
|Yoo-hoo, Marco! Guess who's here! You have a visitor! Marco!
|-
!Marco
|[whispers] Jackie!
|-
!
|''StarFan13 uses Star's hand to slam the bathroom door with continuous Narwhal Blasts.''
|-
!StarFan13
|Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco! Great work, Star!
|-
!Star
|Yeah. Yeah, you bet.
|-
!
|''Marco slowly comes out of the bathroom.''
|-
![[Ferguson O'durguson]] and [[Alfonzo Dolittle]]
|(''o.s.'') Hey, Marco!
|-
!Marco
|Huh?
|-
!
|''[[Ferguson O'durguson|Ferguson]] and [[Alfonzo Dolittle|Alfonzo]] run up to hug Marco.''
|-
!Ferguson
|[laughs]
|-
!Alfonzo
|[laughs] Marco, it's so good to see you!
|-
!Ferguson
|Are you all right, man? You look a little freaked.
|-
!Marco
|No, no, no, I'm fine. I mean, I just thought you guys were... maybe... Jackie or something.
|-
!Ferguson
|Jackie? Nah. Last I heard, she was studying abroad in France, so I don't think she'll be coming by anytime soon. I mean, unless she wants a taco. [laughs] Say hello to our new D&D group!
|-
!
|''Ferguson introduces four cool-looking guys and girls.''
|-
!Cool Girl
|What up?
|-
!Marco
|These guys play D&D?
|-
!Alfonzo
|Oh, being a nerd has gotten super cool since you left.
|-
!Cloudy
|Special delivery from Star! [puts Mariposa's baby carrier on Marco]
|-
!Marco
|What the heck?!
|-
!Mariposa
|[giggles]
|-
!Ferguson
|Cool! Star and Marco had a baby!
|-
!Marco
|No! It's not our baby! It's—!
|-
!Ferguson
|Aw, cool! Star's here! Guys, this is the one I was telling you about. She does real magic.
|-
!Alfonzo
|Hey, Star! Can you, uh, conjure a unicorn stampede?
|-
!Star
|Awww, unicorns.
|-
!StarFan13
|Sorry, guys, she's kinda busy at the moment doing nothing. See?
|-
!
|''StarFan13 picks up Star's arm, and it flops back down on the table.''
|-
!StarFan13
|Just like an old cat! [crazed laughter] I could do this all day!
|-
!
|''Sensei gives bag of tacos to Ferguson and Alfonzo and Marco's Frequent Eater card to Marco.''
|-
!Sensei
|Here's 30 tacos and 30 punches.
|-
!Marco
|I'm getting really close! Thanks for the punches, guys.
|-
!Ferguson
|Ah, sure thing, Marco! Hey, I'll see ya! Gotta go crush some elves!
|-
!Alfonzo
|I'm sure we'll see you really soon though!
|-
!
|''Ferguson and Alfonzo leave. Scene cuts to nighttime. Star, Marco, Mariposa, Cloudy, and StarFan13 are still at Britta's Tacos, and Marco is still eating tacos.''
|-
!Marco
|[chomps, gulps, groans] I just need two more punches. [groans] Why hasn't anyone else come by?
|-
!StarFan13
|This is more of a lunch place, actually.
|-
!Marco
|Wait! [[Janna Ordonia|Janna]]! She can get me a few punches, I bet!
|-
!Sensei
|Hold on there, bro! Janna isn't welcome around here anymore! She's banned for life!
|-
!
|''Sensei points at a wall with several pictures of Janna on it, some of which show her wearing disguises.''
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] Looks like it's up to you, Diaz. Let's get this over with.
|-
!Mariposa
|[babbling]
|-
!Marco
|[walks up to counter] Two tacos, please.
|-
!Sensei
|Bad news, Marco. You bought us out of every ingredient. All we have to make tacos with are these home-grown Echo Creek white-hot pain peppers.
|-
!Marco
|[gags, gulps] Haven't those been outlawed in, like, 16 states?
|-
!Sensei
|What am I? A cop? Embrace the pain!
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] Nah, man. I'm done. My quest for the mystery prize is a bust. Two punches! I just needed two!
|-
!
|''Someone punches Marco's arm twice from off-screen.''
|-
!Marco
|Ow! Ow! Huh?
|-
!
|''Jackie Lynn Thomas appears beside Marco.''
|-
![[Jackie Lynn Thomas]]
|You want chips on the side?
|-
!Marco
|Jackie?! I thought you were...! Hi!
|-
!Jackie
|[sees Mariposa] Aww, who's this little lady? Looks like you've been busy.
|-
!Marco
|She's not mine! I mean... she's... she's mine. Just not ''mine'' mine. She's my sister.
|-
!Jackie
|[laughs] Classic Diaz. Oh, hey, I've got somebody I'd like ''you'' to meet.
|-
!
|''Chloe appears next to Jackie.''
|-
!Chloe
|''Bonjour!'' (Hello)
|-
!Jackie
|Chloe, meet Marco.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, hi! How do you guys know each other?
|-
!Chloe
|We met in France.
|-
!Jackie
|She taught me all about the beauty of French architecture and how to do sweet parkour off it. ''Montre-lui'' (Show him), Chloe.
|-
!Chloe
|''D'accord!'' (Okay)
|-
!
|''Chloe runs up to Star's table and does a circular parkour swing off the umbrella stand.''
|-
!Star
|[whispers] She's so cool.
|-
!Chloe
|''Voilà!''
|-
!Jackie
|Now I'm showing her the coolest of Echo Creek life: skateboarding and pain pepper tacos!
|-
!Marco
|Pain pepper tacos? Hey! Uh, if you give me your two punches, I'll buy them for you. [gives money to Sensei]
|-
!Jackie
|Dude, Diaz! What a gentleman!
|-
!
|''Jackie takes two pepper tacos from Sensei and gives one to Chloe.''
|-
!Chloe
|Ready for ze pain?
|-
!Jackie and Chloe
|''Un, deux, trois!'' (One, two, three) [bite into tacos]
|-
!Jackie
|Aah! [breathing heavily]
|-
!Chloe
|Oh, ''sacré bleu!'' Oh, my gosh, it's so spicy!
|-
!Jackie
|[laughing]
|-
!Marco
|[smiles]
|-
!Jackie
|Well, Marco, thanks for the tacos. It's really nice to see you.
|-
!Marco
|Really? 'Cause I wasn't sure if things were cool between us.
|-
!Jackie
|Of course things are cool, bro. You just bought us tacos.
|-
!Marco
|I don't know. I was in the bathroom thinking about life, and it dawned on me: Marco, you were a terrible boyfriend to Jackie.
|-
!Jackie
|[wide-eyed]
|-
!Marco
|And you're Jackie.
|-
!Jackie
|[laughing]
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!Jackie
|Nothing. You're just the best. Look, as boyfriends go, you were pretty standard. But you always knew how to make me laugh.
|-
!Marco
|Standard? You're not just saying that?
|-
!Jackie
|Look, I learned a lot about myself in France, and we just weren't the best match. And that's okay. It doesn't mean we can't be friends.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah. That's what I was hoping.
|-
!StarFan13
|[sobbing] That's soooo beautiful! [slapping Star's hand on the table]
|-
!Jackie
|Okay, Marco. Well, we better get going. Bye, Star!
|-
!Star
|Bye, Jackie!
|-
!Jackie
|Now, she's a special girl, Marco. [ruffles Marco's hair] Make sure you don't mess that one up. Stay amazing.
|-
!Chloe
|''Au revoir!'' (Till we meet again)
|-
!
|''Jackie and Chloe ride away on skateboards while holding hands.''
|-
!Marco
|Bye.
|-
!
|''On Star and Marco's table, Marco's "Tacos Frequent Eater" card has 200 punches. Next to the card is a napkin that says "TWO PUNCHES! CHLOE & JACKIE" with a smiley face.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Marco's got all 50 punches! [grabs card and gives it to Sensei] Prize! Now!
|-
!Sensei
|Sorry, the prize has been stolen. [chuckles]
|-
!Star
|What?! Well, what was it?!
|-
!Oskar
|A T-shirt. Said "Britta's Tacos" on it. Pretty sweet.
|-
!Marco
|You know, the real prize was getting to see all our friends.
|-
!StarFan13
|[breathing heavily, hugs Marco] Friends!
|-
!Marco
|[gags] I think I just threw up a little bit.
