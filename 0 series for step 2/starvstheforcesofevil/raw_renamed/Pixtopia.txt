|-
!Pixie
|I'm sorry, but you have exceeded your minutes. Your mirror service has been temporarily suspended. Please visit our office in [[Pixtopia (location)|Pixtopia]] to settle your bill. [giggles, hangs up]
|-
!Star
|[gasps] No! What if my mom tries to call me?! She's gonna freak!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, sorry, Star. That's my bad. The calls were totally my idea.
|-
!Star
|Marco, you messed up! Now you're just like me. Yeeeees.
|-
!Marco
|What? No! I-I made one mistake.
|-
!Star
|You sure "Star'd" this whole thing up. How's it feel? Not bad, right? [hugs Marco] Oh, Marco, now we can be mess-up twins!
|-
!Marco
|What?! Man, I ain't no twin. I'm... I'm... I'm Marco Diaz, only child!

|-
!
|''Two pixies kiss Alfonzo's cheeks.''
|-
!Alfonzo
|Awww, they're so small!
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, Alfonzo, and Ferguson approach the [[Pixie Mirror Office]].''
|-
!Star
|Here we are! How you gonna "Star" this one up, twinsy?
|-
!Marco
|I already told you, Star, I ain't no twin! Marco Diaz came into this world alone. Alone!
|-
!Ferguson

|-
!
|''Ferguson gets stuck in the door trying to enter the office. Alfonzo struggles to pull him inside.''

|-
!
|''Marco places the bills on the counter in front of the pixie clerk.''
|-
!Marco
|This is for the Butterfly account. I think that should cover it. And, uh, this is for you. [adds a quarter] Go buy yourself some of those thimble-sized shoes.
|-
!
|''The pixie clerk throws the bills in Marco's face.''
|-
!Pixie clerk
|I'm sorry, sir. We only accept gold and jewels. You'll have to work of the bill in the [[Shard Mines]].
|-
!Star, Marco, Alfonzo, and Ferguson
|Shard Mines?
|-
!
|''The pixie clerk opens a trapdoor under Star, Marco, Alfonzo, and Ferguson, and they fall through.''

|-
!Ferguson
|[screaming, stops] Hey, guys.
|-
!Star

|-
!Star
|Okay. You want some of this? Let's go, little man!
|-
!Marco
|[holds Star back] Whoa-whoa. Easy, Star. Okay. Okay, sir, I'm-I'm sure we can work this out. See, this is the princess of [[Mewni]], Star Butterfly. Her [[King Butterfly|dad]] has connections.
|-
!Ferguson
|And I'm King Fergon!
|-
!Taskmaster

|-
!Pixie Guard
|Empress this prisoner was disobedient.
|-
!Pixie Empress
|He looks ''delicious''.
|-
!Ferguson
|Wha?
|-
!Pixie Empress
|[flies up to Ferguson] Are you a king?
|-
!Ferguson
|Uh... This is a plunger.
|-
!Pixie Empress
|Tell me, are you betrothed?
|-
!Ferguson
|Yes. ...What is betrothed?
|-
!Pixie Empress
|[giggling] Oh, such wit!
|-
!Ferguson
|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Are you, um... Are you, like, into me?
|-
!Pixie Empress
|Oh, big time.
|-
!Ferguson
|[blushes] Wow. Wow! [laughing nervously] Alright! Alright, so you think you can let my friends—
|-
!Pixie Empress
|[kisses Ferguson on the cheek]
|-
!Ferguson
|...
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Shard Mines. Star, Marco, and Alfonzo are still mining.''
|-
!Alfonzo
|[coughing violently]
|-
!Minotaur
|Looks like your friend's getting a bad case of pixie lung.
|-
!Marco
|This is crazy! We have to find a way out of here and save Ferguson!
|-
!Wizard
|Sorry. There's no way out. Not that I've seen—
|-
!Star
|What about that mine cart?
|-
!
|''Star points to an empty mine cart near a neon "EXIT" sign.''
|-
!Wizard
|But that's the bathroom.
|-
!Minotaur
|Like fried eggs.
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, and Alfonzo climb into the mine cart.''
|-
!Star
|Come on!
|-
!Taskmaster
|Guards! Seize them!
|-
!
|''The minotaur and wizard jump into the mine cart, and it speeds down the tracks. The taskmaster and pixie guard follow in a second mine cart. Cut back to the Pixie Empress' throne room. Ferguson enjoys a bubble bath while a pixie fans him with a giant leaf.''
|-
!Pixie Empress
|I've never met anyone with such beautiful, soft, excess skin.
|-
!Ferguson
|[laughing] Oh, yes! I try to not move around too much.
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Shard Mines. The pixies chase Star, Marco, Alfonzo, the minotaur, and the wizard through the elaborate mine shafts.''
|-
!Star, Marco, Alfonzo, Minotaur, and Wizard
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''A pixie guard throws a crystal shard onto the tracks. Star and the others' cart briefly flips through the air before it lands right-side up. They land back inside the cart and continue forward. When the two carts gets close, and the pixie taskmaster whips at the wizard. The two carts end up on parallel tracks.''
|-
!Star
|Hey! You should watch where you're going!
|-
!Taskmaster
|''You'' watch where ''you're'' going!
|-
!
|''The pixies' cart takes a sudden drop.''
|-
!Taskmaster
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''Star and the others' cart travel up into the Pixie Empress' throne room.''
|-
!Star, Marco, Alfonzo, Minotaur, and Wizard
|Oof!
|-
!Pixies
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Two pixies point swords at them. A third pixie points a chainsaw at them. Ferguson sits on a pile of pillows being served various foods.''
|-
!Ferguson
|Hey! I was just about to come rescue you guys!
|-
!Alfonzo
|[hugs Ferguson] Ferguson! I was so worried!
|-
!Ferguson
|Yeah. Turns out they worship me here.
|-
!
|''Six pixies carry Ferguson across the room.''
|-
!Ferguson
|''And'' check out my new girlfriend. That's right, I did, I said "girlfriend."
|-
!Pixie Empress
|He calls me Sugar Wings. [giggling]
|-
!Ferguson
|I am so happy you guys are here. You're just in time for my wedding!
|-
!
|''Several banners unfurl from the ceiling. Pixies appear seated in chapel pews. Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" plays.''
|-
!Pastor pixie
|Are you two ready to swear your undying love for each other?
|-
!Marco
|No! This is crazy! Ferguson, think about this! You're not ready for this kind of commitment! You're only fourteen! You still paint a face on your stomach and make it talk!
|-
!
|''Ferguson lifts up his shirt to reveal a face on his stomach drawn in marker.''
|-
!Ferguson's stomach face
|He has a point.
|-
!Ferguson
|Empress, you're an amazing flying pixie lady and you're really cool, but... I didn't really think this through. I'm sorry. I can't marry you.
|-
!Pixie Empress
|[smiles] Hmm. Guards... kill them all.
|-
!
|''The pixies attack the group with swords. Marco fights back with karate, and Star defends herself with her wand. Ferguson hides behind the wedding cake. He removes the Ferguson figurine from the top of the cake.''
|-
!Ferguson
|Fly free, little Ferg! [takes the Pixie Empress figurine] And I am saving ''you'' for later.
|-
!
|''Star knocks a sword out of a pixie's hand. It falls on top of three pixies about to attack the minotaur and wizard, knocking them out.''
|-
!Star
|Winter Storm Hyper Blow!
|-
!
|''Star blasts the pixies with cold air, freezing them in ice. Star opens a dimensional portal.''
|-
!Star
|Let's go!
|-
!Pixie Empress
|No! I haven't killed you yet!
|-
!Star
|Rainbow Flytrap!
|-
!
|''Star traps the Pixie Empress and her guards in a rainbow-colored flytrap.''
|-
!Empress and Guards
|Oof!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco jump through the portal. Ferguson steps halfway through.''
|-
!Ferguson
|I still think you're cool! [leaves]
|-
!Pixie Empress
|[sighs] He was out of my league anyway.
|-
!
|''Cut to Star's bedroom. Star falls onto her bed.''
|-
!Star
|That's it! I'm switching service providers!
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, good call. Star, I feel bad. I think I may have ruined Ferguson's one chance at love. Maybe we ''are'' mess-up twins.
|-
!Star
|Oh, Marco. That pixie didn't love Ferguson. She just wanted to eat him.
|-
!Marco
|Really?
|-
!Star
|And let's be honest. Ferguson does look ''delicious''.
|-
!Marco and Star
|[laughing]
|-
!Marco
|Well, yeah, I guess nobody's perfect.
|-
!
|''Camera pans out to show Ferguson standing a few feet away.''
|-
!Ferguson
|Uh, why are you guys talking about me like I'm not here? And where's Alfonzo?
|-
!
|''Cut back to Pixie Empress' throne room. The Empress is getting married to Alfonzo.''
|-
!Pastor pixie
|You may now kiss the bride.
|-
!Alfonzo and Empress
|[kiss]
|-
!Pixies
|[cheering]
|-
!Alfonzo
|Yay! I will make a great pixie king! I'll be very tyrannical, hmm?
