|''Episode begins on Pie Island. At the pier, [[Star Butterfly|Star]] is next to a boat, wearing red Pie Folk clothes. Several Pie Folk walk past her. She reaches into her handbag and takes out the pie from the end of [[Butterfly Follies|the previous episode]].''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Okay, [[Moon Butterfly|Mom]]. Where are you? [walks forward]
|-
![[King Butterfly|King River]]
|[appears in Pie Folk clothes and eye patch] Star, wait! Look, I want to find your mom as much as you do, but trust the Pie Folk here, and you'll lose everything. Even your mind.
|-
!Man with Axe
|You guys obviously aren't from around here, huh?
|-
!River
|Ha! What are you talking about? This is our home. Did you not notice that we're dressed in the traditional garb of the Pie Folk?
|-
!Man with Axe
|Yeah, whatever. Anyway, if you're gonna leave, you should have somebody keep an eye on your boat. I'll be happy to do it for a few bucks.
|-
!River
|Good idea! Just allow me to grab my things.
|-
!
|''River tosses an anchor onto the boat and through its hull, causing it to sink.''
|-
!Star
|Dad!
|-
!Man with Axe
|A'ight. I'm out. [walks away]
|-
!River
|That's right! Run away! I won't be swindled by you and yours!
|-
!Star
|Dad, what are you doing?
|-
!River
|Oh, can't you see he's a racketeer? That scoundrel wants us to pay him to protect our boat from himself. We have to stay ahead of these schemes if we're going to find your mother. Now, where's [[Marco Diaz|Marco]]?
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|(''o.s.'') Here.
|-
!
|''Marco appears wearing a giant pie over his usual outfit.''
|-
!Marco
|Uh, where's the boat?
|-
!River
|I sank it. Where's the bloodhound?
|-
!Marco
|The sales guy said that only a fool would use a bloodhound to track someone. So, I bought this instead! [takes out a white monkey]
|-
!Monkey
|[chitters]
|-
!Star
|You got... a monkey.
|-
!River
|No, Pumpkin, he got swindled.
|-
!Marco
|No, it'll work. Just look at his beauty mark. Our spirits are bonded. Have him sniff the pie.
|-
!
|''Star holds the pie up to the monkey's face.''
|-
!Monkey
|[sniffs]
|-
!Marco
|Now, go find Queen Moon! [tosses monkey onto the pier]
|-
!
|''The monkey slowly blinks its eyes and holds up Marco's wallet.''
|-
!Marco
|Is that my wallet?!
|-
!
|''The monkey waves its hand over its face and looks mischievous.''
|-
!Marco
|But... But we're spirit bonded!
|-
!
|''The monkey removes its own beauty mark, revealed to be fake, and flicks it away.''
|-
!Marco
|No! Not the beauty mark!
|-
!Monkey
|[laughs, clicks tongue, runs away]
|-
!Marco
|Monkey, no!
|-
!River
|You see, Star? Swindled. Uh, Star?
|-
!
|''Marco and River notice Star is gone. In the Pie Folk village, Star goes up to a little boy sitting by a pig-drawn wagon.''
|-
!Star
|Aw, hey there, little guy. Do you think you can tell me where they make these pies?
|-
!Sandy
|Sure, I know where. And I'll tell you – ''if'' you help me steal this wagon.
|-
!Star
|Steal? J— No! What?! No!
|-
!River
|(''o.s.'') It's a deal!
|-
!Star
|Dad, what are you doing?
|-
!River
|Um, give us a second, my boy. [pulls Star aside] It's okay. You see, this kid is running a classic Pie Folk scam. The wagon belongs to him, and he wants us to steal his wagon so that the shill can come out of hiding and catch us in the act of stealing his wagon. We need to draw the shill out of hiding! [gnaws on wagon padlock]
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|[runs up to River] Hey, you there, stop!
|-
!River
|There he is! Ho-hah!
|-
!
|''River belly-flops the short man to the ground.''
|-
!River
|Ah-ha!
|-
!Star
|Dad, stop! You're hurting him!
|-
!River
|No! Don't you see? He's the shill!
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|Ah! I'm not the shill! The shill is over there!
|-
!Shifty Man with Cane
|Yeah, he's right. I am the shill. Me and the boy were trying to trick you out of your wallet, but it didn't work.
|-
!Star and Marco
|What?
|-
!Shifty Man with Cane
|All right, come on, Sandy. Get back in your little hole there. Let's get going.
|-
!
|''The little boy gets sucked up into the cane-holding man's stubby right leg, and they walk off.''
|-
!River
|Ugh! I got the wrong shill!
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|I was just trying to stop him from robbing you. They robbed me last week. That's why I've got the broken arm.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco help the short man off the ground.''
|-
!Marco
|Easy does it, sir.
|-
!Star
|I am so sorry. You will have to forgive my dad.
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|Typical lazy thinking, if you ask me. You think all Pie Folk are liars and thieves! Some of us are good, you know? Luckily, I have a pretty thick crust. [crying] Oh, Boysenberry! Why are people so cruel?!
|-
!Star
|W-W-W-Wait, please. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. We didn't mean any harm. Before you go, just... Do you know who made this pie?
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|Well, actually, I... I do.
|-
!Star
|Oh, sweet! Can you take us there? Please, please, please, please, please, please, please?
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|I'm not too keen on doing favors for people who assault me. [climbs onto wagon] Okay, Boysenberry, let's be on our way. [to Star] I wish you well. Sorry I wasn't able to help you.
|-
!River
|[stops wagon] Just a moment, please! [groans] This... This does not come easy for me, for I am but an old man set in his ways. But please, please forgive me. I just... I just miss my Moonpie! [crying]
|-
!Star
|Dad, no. Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. We're going to find her.
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|You know, I-I lost a pie myself, once. Oh, please... please allow me to take you to where your pie was made.
|-
!
|''The short man gives Star, Marco, and River a wagon ride through the village.''
|-
!Star
|We really, really appreciate this. I was beginning to lose hope.
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|Well, not to worry. Always happy to help.
|-
!River
|[crying]
|-
!Marco
|[gives River a handkerchief] Don't cry, River. Here.
|-
!River
|[sobbing softly, grabs Marco's wrist] Aah! Marco!
|-
!Marco
|What?! What is going on?
|-
!River
|Marco, these tears are fake tears.
|-
!Marco
|[teary-eyed] Mine are real.
|-
!River
|I want to show you something.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, no, no. You— No. You don't have to do that.
|-
!
|''River pulls up his left pant leg. Several crabs are pinching his leg.''
|-
!River
|Ho-ho! That's bracing. That is bracing. Those little devils get the tears flowing. You see, I played on the little fool's sympathy to get him to take us to Moon. I've got him right where I want— [groans] Ouch!
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|I say, would you be a dear and pull that lever for me, please? What with the arm and all.
|-
!
|''Star pulls the lever, and the wagon rattles. The top half of a pillory raises up and falls to capture Star, Marco, and River inside.''
|-
!River
|Ow! [stammers] What's this?! This wasn't supposed to happen!
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|Is everyone comfy?
|-
!River
|What's going on here, you little weirdo?!
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|Oh, honestly. Did you really think your petty scams and those ridiculous disguises would work on us? [chuckles]
|-
!Marco
|Aww, my disguise was starting to grow on me.
|-
!Short Pie Folk Man
|Oh! [giggles] That's shocking... because I find them to be rather confining.
|-
!
|''The short man unzips his disguise to reveal a very tall man inside. He un-contorts his body and stands up straight.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|Ugh...!
|-
!River
|I was wrong again.
|-
!Pie King
|[sinister laughter] Everyone, everyone, gather round, gather round! And say hello to our new guests. [removes hook hand] And for the right price, I'm sure they'll make delicious pies.
|-
!Star
|Wait, what? Make pies?
|-
!Pie King
|[puts on auctioning gavel] Now, who will start the bidding?
|-
!Lanky, Bearded Man
|I'll give ya five bucks!
|-
!Short, Chubby Man
|I'll give you ten.
|-
!Man with Fork and Knife
|I'll pay twenty!
|-
!Marco
|They're gonna eat us!
|-
!Star
|No, Marco, I took that to mean we're gonna help them make pies. Right, Dad?
|-
!River
|[crying] I don't know anything anymore!
|-
!
|''The Pie Folk shout over each other making bids. The white monkey that stole Marco's wallet appears in the crowd.''
|-
!Marco
|[gasps] Monkey!
|-
!
|''The monkey takes out a gold key.''
|-
!Marco
|Monkey, the key! Yes! I just knew we had a connection, you little—!
|-
!Monkey
|[steals Marco's shoes]
|-
!Monkey
|Hey! My shoes!
|-
!
|''The monkey makes off with Marco's shoes and tosses the key away.''
|-
!Marco
|The key!
|-
!Pie King
|[bangs gavel] Sold! To Fat Brett Scamson for the price of—!
|-
!
|''A tall, gravelly-voiced figure in a cloak appears in the crowd.''
|-
!Cloaked Figure
|Wait! I'll give you 45 billion, 710 million, 412 thousand, 242... pennies!
|-
!Crowd
|[gasps]
|-
!Pie King
|Sold.
|-
!Cloaked Figure
|[writes a check] Do not cash this till Monday. [gives check to Pie King]
|-
!Pie King
|[sniffs the check] Deal! [bangs gavel]
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, and River are tossed into the cloaked figure's house. They stand over them and reach into their cloak.''
|-
!Star
|I hope you get a refund, 'cause you just made a bad purchase.
|-
!
|''Star gets ready to fight, but she gets hit in the face with a rubber chicken.''
|-
!Star
|Wha...?!
|-
!Cloaked Figure
|The only thing bad...
|-
!
|''Four eyes appear under the cloaked figure's hood. They pull back their hood to reveal [[Foolduke]] and her monkey.''
|-
![[Foolduke]]
|...is that check I just wrote! Whoops! I have no money.
|-
!Monkey
|[shrieks]
|-
!Star
|Foolduke!
|-
!Marco
|Monkey?!
|-
!Monkey
|[shrieks]
|-
!Foolduke
|Oh, I was wondering where he got these. [holds Marco's shoes]
|-
!Star
|[hugs Foolduke] Aww, I knew there was somebody good on this island!
|-
!Foolduke
|[to monkey] Give the wallet back.
|-
!
|''The monkey gives Marco his wallet. Marco takes his wallet and shoes and backs away.''
|-
!Star
|What the— What are you doing here?
|-
!Foolduke
|Well... I'm from here.
|-
!Star
|You Pie Folk?
|-
!Foolduke
|Yup, just came to visit the old family. Hey, family! We got company!
|-
!Foolduke's Father
|They got anything good?
|-
!Foolduke
|No! And quit scamming my husband!
|-
!
|''Foolduke's parents are playing a board game with [[Ruberiot]].''
|-
![[Ruberiot]]
|It's okay, honey. I can feel a winning streak coming my way. [rolls dice] Noooo!
|-
!
|''Ruberiot gives his hat to Foolduke's parents, and they put it on a pile of stuff they already won from him.''
|-
!Foolduke
|Star, what are you doing here?
|-
!Star
|Well, we've been trying to find my mom. [shows Foolduke the pie]
|-
!Foolduke
|That's a pie.
|-
!Star
|Yup. This pie is gonna lead us to my mom. Only she bakes pies like this.
|-
!Foolduke
|[sighs, walks off-screen]
|-
!Star
|We just need to find where she's making them.
|-
!Foolduke
|(''o.s.'') Star?
|-
!
|''Foolduke reveals several pies that look identical to Star's pie.''
|-
!Star
|You Queen-napped my mom?
|-
!Foolduke
|No. Pie Folk have been making pies like this for hundreds of years.
|-
!Star
|Even with the little butterfly?
|-
!Foolduke
|Actually, it's a moth. I'm sorry, Star, but your mom's not here. Maybe that's a good thing. This place is terrible! Ruberiot's lost everything except the hot air balloon we got here with!
|-
!Ruberiot
|Nooooo! My wife is gonna kill me.
|-
!
|''The white monkey hangs from the hot air balloon that Foolduke's parents just won from Ruberiot.''
|-
!River
|How do you play this game?
|-
!Foolduke's Father
|Give me that ring, and I'll teach ya.
|-
!Star
|Oh, no.
|-
!River
|[starts to remove his ring]
|-
!Star
|Come on, Dad. Let's go.
|-
!River
|[puts ring back on] Okay, honey.
|-
!Star
|[sighs]
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, and River leave Foolduke's house and fly away from Pie Island on [[Cloudy]].''
|-
!Marco
|So, what do we do now?
|-
!River
|[teary-eyed] Sleep... until the pain in my heart is gone. [whimpering, covers himself with Cloudy]
|-
!Star
|[crying]
|-
!
|''They fly into a cloud of smoke.''
|-
!Marco
|It's okay. We'll... We'll figure something out.
|-
!Star
|[crying, sniffing]
|-
!Marco
|Wait. Are you crying, or are those allergies?
|-
!Star
|[sniffing]
|-
!Marco
|What—? Uh, what—? What are you doing?
|-
!River
|[sniffing]
|-
!Marco
|Uh, what's going on?
|-
!Star
|You smell that?
|-
!River
|I'd recognize that particular blend of cinnamon and cardamom anywhere!
|-
!Star
|Foolduke's pies didn't smell like that. Mom's here! Cloudy, take us into that volcano.
|-
![[Cloudy]]
|Okay! [flies down toward volcano]
|-
!Marco
|Wait, we're going into a volcano?!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to black. Cut back to Star, Marco, River, and Cloudy flying down into the volcano's mouth.''
|-
!Star
|I know you're down here, Mom. I just know it.
|-
!River
|Okay, does everyone have their emergency preparation meat in case we're held captive for the rest of our lives?
|-
!Star
|Yes, Dad.
|-
!Monkey
|[appears on Marco's head, hooting]
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Cloudy hits the bottom of the volcano, causing Star, Marco, and River to fall off.''
|-
!Star, Marco, and River
|[scream, grunt]
|-
!Cloudy
|Oops! Sorry! I-I didn't see the ground there.
|-
!
|''A steam whistle blows.''
|-
!Star
|What?
|-
!
|''Star and Marco walk over to and look over a nearby ledge.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|Whoa...!
|-
!
|''In a giant factory, dozens of Pie Folk make pies together. One of them churns butter, two others squish dirt with their feet, three others mold the dirt into pie shapes, and several more carry them to a table. Someone, from off-screen, uses magic to levitate the pies, turn their dirt filling into more edible ingredients, and cover them with pie crust, all while humming a song.''
|-
!Marco
|That song! Star, isn't that your—?
|-
!Star
|[gasps] It is!
|-
!
|''The person humming folds pie dough into a butterfly shape and places it on top of a pie. They levitate several pies into the central oven to bake, and use their magic to stoke the flames. When one of the pies is fully baked, they levitate it out of the oven. It is revealed to be Queen Moon.''
|-
!Star
|[echoing] '''''MOM!'''''
|-
!Marco
|[covers Star's mouth] What are you doing?!
|-
!Star
|[shoves Marco away] Marco, get your hands off of me!
|-
!Marco
|Star, I know we finally found your mom, but let's not blow this.
|-
!
|''A chef's hat flies past Star's face.''
|-
!River
|(''o.s.'') [grunting]
|-
!Star
|Huh?
|-
!
|''River beats up a couple of Pie Folk and removes their hats and aprons.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, great idea, Dad! We'll get in using disguises!
|-
!River
|Disguises? Oh! Yes! That's exactly what I was doing.
|-
!Pie Folk Man
|[pained groan]
|-
!
|''Star dresses up like a Pie Folk baker.''
|-
!Star
|Okay, let's go get my mom.
|-
!Marco
|Ugh! You know we already did disguises, and it didn't work?
|-
!Star
|Yup! Let's go.
|-
!River
|But don't I get a costume? I'm the one who beat them up.
|-
!Star
|No, you can't go! Oh, I'm sorry. You always mess things up! Uh, is that mean? I know that sounds mean. I love you so much, Dad.
|-
!River
|Uh, [stammers] I love you, too.
|-
!Star
|[pulls Marco along and runs toward factory] Don't worry! You have a purpose on this mission, Daddy! Just not right now!
|-
!Cloudy
|Uh, bring back some pie for Cloudy, okay?
|-
!
|''The monkey pops out of Cloudy with a slice of pie.''
|-
!Cloudy
|[long breathy gasp]
|-
!
|''Star and Marco lower down to the factory from a rope and spy on the Pie Folk from behind a rock wall.''
|-
!Star
|All right, I got an idea.
|-
!Marco
|Great. What is it?
|-
!Star
|[runs into the factory]
|-
!Marco
|W-What? Star, what are you doing?
|-
!
|''Moon hands freshly-baked pies to a line of Pie Folk chefs. Star gets in line and approaches Moon from behind.''
|-
!Star
|Hey, Mom!
|-
![[Moon Butterfly|Moon]]
|[turns to face Star] You call me "Mom"?
|-
!Star
|[takes pie from Moon] No.
|-
!
|''Star walks away, and Moon looks confused. Star goes back behind the rock wall where Marco is.''
|-
!Star
|All right, my mom's completely lost her memory.
|-
!Marco
|Okay, so what do we do?
|-
!Star
|I got an idea.
|-
!Marco
|Great. What is it?
|-
!Star
|[runs into the factory again]
|-
!Marco
|[stammers] Star, wait! What are you doing?!
|-
!
|''Star makes a pair of Rainbow Fists and charges at the Pie Folk.''
|-
!Star
|Yaaaaaah!
|-
!Marco
|Star?!
|-
!
|''Pie Folk surround Marco, and he fights them off with karate.''
|-
!Star
|Bunny Rabbit Blast!
|-
!
|''Star blasts some Pie Folk away with a blast of bunnies, then jumps into a circle of Pie Folk.''
|-
!Star
|Tiara Tornado!
|-
!
|''Star blows away all the surrounding Pie Folk except for a green-haired woman with an eye patch.''
|-
!Woman with Eye Patch
|Intruder!
|-
!Star
|Super Geyser Windstorm!
|-
!
|''Star launches the green-haired woman into the air with a geyser of water.''
|-
!Moon
|[giving pie to chef] Here you go.
|-
!
|''The green-haired woman falls into the lava near Moon.''
|-
!Moon
|What?
|-
!
|''The chef Moon was about to hand the pie to gets blasted with more water.''
|-
!Star
|Sorry, Mom! [ties burlap sack over Moon's head]
|-
!
|''Star puts a burlap sack over Moon's head and carries her off. She blasts away a chef that Marco is fighting and places Moon onto a cart. Marco sits on the cart, and Star pushes the cart. Three Pie Folk block Star's path.''
|-
!Star
|Starfish Tsunami!
|-
!
|''Star washes the Pie Folk away with a tidal wave of starfish.''
|-
!Star
|Quick, this way!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco duck behind a rock wall as more Pie Folk come running.''
|-
!Pie Folk Woman
|Get her!
|-
!Star
|Dad, we're back! Let's go!
|-
!River
|So what if I mess things up? Shouldn't I still get a costume?
|-
!
|''A narwhal from Star's Narwhal Blast lands on River's lap.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Dad!
|-
!River
|Mm? Oh! [laughs] Right.
|-
!
|''River and Cloudy reach the bottom of the rock wall next to Star and Marco. Star and Marco jump onto Cloudy with Moon in a sack.''
|-
!River
|Moonpie! [hugs Moon] You're even more beautiful than I remembered.
|-
!Moon
|[muffled] I am not a pie!
|-
!Pie Folk Woman
|[turns around] Hey, get 'em!
|-
!Pie Folk
|[clamoring] Get 'em! Don't let 'em go! Don't let 'em get away!
|-
!
|''The Pie Folk try to stop Star and the others, but they start flying upward and out of range.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|[cheering]
|-
!
|''Cloudy suddenly turns green and starts losing altitude, falling back toward the ground.''
|-
!Pie Folk Woman
|You come back here!
|-
!Star
|No! No-no-no-no-no-no-no! What's going on?!
|-
!Marco
|Uh, I think something's going on with Cloudy.
|-
!
|''The monkey force-feeds numerous pies to Cloudy, causing him to get physically sick.''
|-
!Cloudy
|[groaning]
|-
!
|''Marco stops the monkey from feeding Cloudy.''
|-
!Marco
|Oh! Monkey!
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, and River fall into a circle of Pie Folk. Three of them catch Moon in their arms.''
|-
!Pie Folk
|[sinister laugh]
|-
!Star
|[growls] Sparkle Lightning Blast!
|-
!
|''Star makes an opening in the Pie Folk's circle with a blast of magic.''
|-
!Pie Folk
|[exclaim]
|-
!Star
|[charging another blast] Give me my mom!
|-
!Pie King
|[shoving through Pie Folk crowd] Ugh! Stop, stop, stop! Knock it off, you!
|-
!Star
|What? What are you doing here?
|-
!Pie King
|Granting you my ''royal'' audience. After all... I'm the Pie King! [reveals crown under his hat]
|-
!Star
|Pie King? How many disguises do you have?
|-
!Pie King
|[pops up behind Star] That doesn't matter right now. What ''does'' matter is the Sky Baker is free to go whenever and wherever she likes.
|-
!Star
|What? Sky Baker?
|-
!Pie King
|Yeah, she fell to us from the sky!
|-
!Star
|She's not the Sky Baker. She's my mom! [to Moon] You're my mom, and I'm the princess. Well, I was the queen, too. But anyway... Look, you need to come back with us to our home.
|-
!Marco
|[jumps up behind crowd] There's lots of corn!
|-
!River
|[jumps up behind crowd] And you are the prettiest one there!
|-
!Moon
|Goodness.
|-
!Pie King
|Well, that sounds lovely. But that's not the full story, is it?
|-
!Star
|What?
|-
!
|''A giant pie is wheeled out on a cart. Some of the Pie Folk bow their heads. The Pie King jumps on top of the giant pie.''
|-
!Pie King
|Behold! The Pie of Truth!
|-
!Marco
|[behind the crowd] I can't see anything.
|-
!River
|Get on my shoulders, my boy!
|-
!
|''River hoists Marco up on his shoulders, allowing Marco to see over the crowd.''
|-
!River
|What do you see?
|-
!Marco
|Well, there's, uh, a giant pie.
|-
!River
|What? Pie? [hoists himself onto Marco's shoulders] What are they plotting?
|-
!Marco
|How the—?! [grunts]
|-
!Pie King
|The Pie of Truth reveals everything. Long ago, a Pie Folk girl traveled to the mainland with a Pie Carnival and was accidentally left behind. She was taken by [[King Shastacan|the king]] of [[Mewni]] and raised by the [[Magic High Commission|Magical High Commission]]. No one knew that she was not of royal blood. Her name was [[Festivia Butterfly|Festivia]]. And she became the queen of Mewni. So, that means your great, great, greaty-great, etcetera granny was Pie Folk. And if Sky Baker is your mama... then ''you're'' Pie Folk, too!
|-
!River
|No! [shoves crowd aside] My Moon is not some dirty pie-monger! I won't allow it!
|-
!
|''The Pie Folk drag River back.''
|-
!River
|Nooooo!
|-
!Star
|No! No, no, no! You're a liar! You're literally the king of liars! There is ''no'' way we're Pie Folk!
|-
!Pie King
|Oh, you think it's a coincidence that your mother just happened to end up here on Pie Island?
|-
!Star
|I-I don't know why she ended up here. But Mom, this isn't your home. Don't you remember anything besides this place?
|-
!Moon
|I don't. I know how to make pies.
|-
!Pie King
|And what delicious pies they are! Thanks to you, we finally have a pie that we can be proud of.
|-
!Moon
|Oh, you... you like my pies?
|-
!Pie King
|I ''do'' like your pies. And if you don't mind, could you get back to the oven and bake some more? We're way behind schedule.
|-
!Moon
|[to Star] I'm going to go make pies now.
|-
!
|''Marco and River shove through the crowd again.''
|-
!River
|No!
