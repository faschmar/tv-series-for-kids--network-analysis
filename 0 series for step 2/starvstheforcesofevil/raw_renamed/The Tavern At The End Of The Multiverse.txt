|''Episode begins where "[[Pizza Party]]" left off. [[Star Butterfly|Star]], [[Marco Diaz|Marco]], [[Moon Butterfly|Moon]], [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]], [[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]], and [[Hekapoo]] are standing in the middle of a muddy forest in the rain. Thunder cracks in the sky.''
|-
![[Hekapoo]]
|Soooo... I'm not hearing a "thank you". I mean, I just saved your life!
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Hekapoo, we were kinda in the middle of something.
|-
!Hekapoo
|In the middle of dying! But hey, I took you somewhere that will solve all that business.
|-
!
|''Hekapoo knocks on a tree trunk. A doorway and a stoic-looking bouncer rises out of the mud.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Welcome to the Tavern at the End of the Multiverse!
|-
!
|''The Tavern at the End of the Multiverse's neon sign blinks on and off.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|[opens tavern door] Now come on, are you just gonna stand out there in the rain?
|-
!
|''Marco and Eclipsa look at Star.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|[to bouncer] They're with me.
|-
!
|''Hekapoo, Star, Marco, Eclipsa, and Meteora enter the tavern.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Hey, Moonie, are you coming in?
|-
!
|''Moon is staring down at the ground. She lifts up her gaze and walks toward the tavern entrance.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Come on, you're gonna love this place.
|-
!
|''Moon enters the tavern, and the entrance closes. The bouncer closes off the entrance with a velvet rope and takes a deep breath. He and the tavern entrance lower back down into the mud. Scene cuts to tavern interior; Hekapoo leads the others through an elevator-like door.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Welcome to the furthest possible place away from all your problems. This quaint watering hole sits at the end of reality and at the start of complete nonexistence.
|-
!
|''The far right end of the tavern is a black void.''
|-
!Tavern Patron
|Hear, hear! Oh! [gets sucked into the void]
|-
!Dog Patron
|[growls at Moon and Eclipsa]
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|I'm getting a vibe that we're not welcome here.
|-
!Hekapoo
|[sits on couch] Most of these people left their dimensions to get away from magical issues or power-hungry rulers. You check both boxes.
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|What?! This doesn't solve any of our problems!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Yeah, it does! We got a sweet place to hang out as [[Mewni]] gets destroyed.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Hekapoo, give me the scissors.
|-
![[Moon Butterfly]]
|Wait, what are you doing?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[[Globgor]] needs my help.
|-
!Moon
|Yes, but it's too dangerous.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, it's too dangerous because of YOU!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Well, y'all are buzzkills. I'm gonna go make the best of this mess.
|-
!Moon
|Star, let's just take a seat and talk about this.
|-
!Star
|What is there to talk about exactly? We can't go back to Mewni because we'll die from a situation that YOU caused! So just stay far away from me!  Or better yet, stand over there where you don't exist!
|-
!
|''Star walks away from Moon, and Moon's eyes start to water.''
|-
!Pool-Playing Dog
|[laughs] Was that your daughter? Talking to you like that? I could never talk to my mom like that, I tell ya.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa grabs the pool-playing dog's pool cue.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|That's it! You're done! All done! Game over!
|-
!Pool-Playing Dog
|Oh, hey, hey! Hey, let go! That's my pool cue!
|-
!Eclipsa and Pool-Playing Dog
|[straining]
|-
!
|''Eclipsa pulls the pool cue away and falls over backward, crashing off-screen.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|So, what do you say, Moon? You wanna get in a quick game of pool?
|-
!Moon
|How can you even think about that at a time like this?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[chalking pool cue] My whole entire life has been a time like this, Moon. You learn to enjoy these moments.
|-
!Pool-Playing Dog
|That's my pool cue.
|-
!Eclipsa
|You should smile more.
|-
!Pool-Playing Dog
|I don't know what that means. [walks away]
|-
!Eclipsa
|You know, I never got a chance to thank you.
|-
!Moon
|Oh, yeah, I put the entire kingdom in jeopardy and destroyed both of our families. You're welcome.
|-
!Eclipsa
|No, I mean thank you for freeing my husband.
|-
!Meteora
|[coos, rolls cue ball into yellow 9 ball]
|-
!Eclipsa
|I can only assume it was you who asked [[Rhombulus]] to release Globgor at my coronation.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to flashback. A hooded Moon walks through the rainy [[Crystal Dimension]] toward Rhombulus' house. Rhombulus opens the door to greet Moon and lets her inside. Scene cuts back to the tavern in present-day. Eclipsa gives the pool cue to Moon.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Your turn!
|-
!Meteora
|[cooing]
|-
!
|''Moon takes the pool cue from Eclipsa, and Eclipsa walks away. Scene cuts to the [[Monster Temple]] on Mewni; [[Mina Loveberry]] and the Solarian Army have gathered all the monsters of Mewni at the edge of a cliff over the ocean.''
|-
![[Mina Loveberry]]
|Monsters of Mewni! For too long, you've plagued our lands with your monster treachery! [helmet visor raises] Wait. This doesn't feel right. [sighs] It's just not the same without the King of Monsters. All right, new plan, new plan. We find Globgor,''then'' we push these freaks off the cliff.
|-
!
|''Mina points her armored finger at Katrina Bulgolyubov. [[Buff Frog]] pulls Katrina in close.''
|-
![[Buff Frog]]
|Don't worry, my babies. Everything will be okay.
|-
!
|''Mina flies toward the Monster Temple. Inside the Temple, [[Kelly]], [[Pony Head]], [[Seahorse]], [[Rich Pigeon]], [[Janna Ordonia|Janna]], [[Quirky Guy]], [[Talon Raventalon]], and [[Jorby]] feel the temple shake.''
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
|Jeez, I am surprised they haven't found us yet.
|-
![[Quirky Guy]]
|[groaning] Can you check on my Devil's Mark?
|-
!Janna
|What's a Devil's Mark?
|-
!
|''Quirky Guy lifts up his shirt. His Solarian Scar has progressed so much that he has a bright white hole in the center of his stomach.''
|-
!Quirky
|D-Does it still look cool?
|-
!Janna
|Mm, yeah, looks pretty cool.
|-
!Quirky
|Y-You know, it's funny. I feel like I spent my entire life trying to be cool, but I only got as far as "quirky".
|-
!Janna
|I know what you mean. I think quirky is cool.
|-
!Quirky
|Really?
|-
!
|''Quirky's scar glows brighter and brighter.''
|-
!Janna
|Whoa, dude. Dude, dude, dude!
|-
!Quirky
|Cool...
|-
!
|''Quirky's body explodes in a flash of light, leaving a black burn mark on the bed he was lying on.''
|-
!Janna
|[screams]
|-
!All
|[screaming]
|-
![[Pony Head]]
|Oh my goodness! We're all gonna die!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the middle of the forest. [[River Butterfly|River]] and Eddie are carrying Globgor on a stretcher made of sticks and leaves. Globgor's Solarian Scar has progressed to the point of covering almost the entire right side of his body.
|-
![[Globgor]]
|[groaning]
|-
!Eddie
|River! Globby's boo-boos are getting bigger!
|-
![[River Butterfly]]
|We just need to get him to the [[Magic Sanctuary]]!
|-
!Eddie
|But what if we don't get him there in time?
|-
!River
|The man is a father! He'll make it in time!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to the tavern. Star is sitting by herself and hugging her legs. Marco walks over holding a glass of pomegranate juice.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey, hey, hey there, buddy. You... You doin' okay?
|-
!Star
|[groans, turns away from Marco]
|-
!Marco
|Uh, Hekapoo said this place has the best pomegranate juice in the multiverse. [slurps, sighs] You wanna try?
|-
!Star
|[groans] I hate magic. [gets up and walks away]
|-
!Marco
|W-What?
|-
!Star
|You were right, Marco! Magic's just... Ugh! I don't even know what it is! I hate magic!
|-
!Marco
|[slurps]
|-
!Star
|I mean, my "wise, royal family" keeps "solving situations" with the stuff, but – oops – we just cause more problems!
|-
!Slug Patron
|This universe would be better without it!
|-
!Star
|That's right! Magic's the worst, and the people that use it are idiots!
|-
!All
|Yeah!
|-
!Star
|No more magic. No more Butterflys. All we need is me and you.
|-
!Marco
|But magic's what brought us together.
|-
!Mouse Waiter
|Milady, a patron sent these over for you.
|-
!
|''The mouse waiter presents Star with a pair of chocolate pudding cups.''
|-
!Star
|Pudding? [groans]
|-
!
|''[[Glossaryck]] is seen sitting at the bar with a pudding cup next to him. He looks back at Star and winks at her.''
|-
![[Glossaryck]]
|[laughs] Hey there, sport. Long time no see.
|-
!Star
|I need a word with you.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Uh, okay—
|-
!
|''Star grabs the top and bottom of Glossaryck's right eye and stretches his eyeball.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|[screams]
|-
!
|''Star jumps inside Glossaryck's eyeball and wriggles her way inside.''
|-
!Moon
|We have to do something. I can't just be stuck in here and play pool.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, you created those Solarian Warriors. Don't they have some kind of weakness or something?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to another flashback. Moon uses her magic to transform Mewmans into Solarian Warriors. Mina watches with a smile.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|(''o.s.'') Moon?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to the tavern in present-day.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Moon?
|-
!Moon
|Uh...
|-
!Eclipsa
|Do the Solarian Warriors have a weakness or what?
|-
!Moon
|Uh, no. Not that I know of.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Look, the way I see it, we have three options. One – we stay here. Two – you give me my wand, and I go back to Mewni and blast those warriors with my Total Anihilation Spell, probably destroying most of the kingdom as well.
|-
!Moon
|Hmmm...
|-
!Eclipsa
|Or three –  you go over there, make amends with your daughter, and the three of us go back together to unleash a wicked bunch of nasty business on those warriors! [growls]
|-
!Moon
|[sighs] Y-You're probably right. But she won't even talk to me.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Moon, look, it's our only real option. I'm sure... once... [trails off]
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') [grunting]
|-
!
|''Moon turns around to look at Star.''
|-
!Moon
|Star?
|-
!
|''Star wriggles inside Glossaryck's giant eyeball, and the eyeball disappears with a "pop".''
|-
!Moon
|What was ''that''?
|-
!
|''Star plummets out of the sky in the dimension inside Glossaryck.''
|-
!Star
|[screaming] Whoa! [exclaiming, shrieking] Okay, Glossaryck, that's enough!
|-
!
|''Star falls onto a bed of clouds.''
|-
!Star
|Oof! [panting] Stupid magic eyeball ride! Stupid magic Glossaryck dimension!
|-
!Glossaryck Statue
|Well, that hurts my feelings.
|-
!
|''An eyeball appears in the Glossaryck's statue's mouth, and the real Glossaryck appears from behind it.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|You barge into my eyeball unannounced and then insult my home? If I knew you were coming, I would've tidied up a bit.
|-
!Star
|Yup, yup, it's official. I hate magic! I'm... I'm gonna destroy it.
|-
!Glossaryck
|What? And how are you going to do that?
|-
!Star
|I could... I could say the Whispering Spell inside the [[Realm of Magic]]. [chuckles] Boom! It's the only way to stop Mina.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Okay, whoa. Calm down. Look, see?
|-
!
|''Glossaryck brings himself and Star into the Tapestry Room of [[Butterfly Castle]].''
|-
!Glossaryck
|It's all gone. It's all gone!
|-
!Star
|Oh, so now you're gonna just put me in the Grandma Room. Why did he put me in the Grandma Room? ...Glossaryck? Glossaryck, please don't leave me here with my dysfunctional family! [sighs] Okay. [waves to Eclipsa's tapestry] Hi, Eclipsa. [waves to Moon's tapestry] Mother. [points at [[Celena Butterfly|Celena]]'s tapestry] Hi, Celena. Wait. Where's Celena?
|-
!
|''Celena Butterfly is missing from her tapestry, leaving a glowing yellow vacant space. Star hears whispering behind her. She turns around to see the previous Queens of Mewni – [[Estrella Butterfly|Estrella]], [[Solaria Butterfly|Solaria]], [[Crescenta Butterfly|Crescenta]], [[Dirhhennia Butterfly|Dirhhennia]], [[Jushtin Butterfly|Jushtin]], [[Rhina Butterfly|Rhina]], Celena, [[Festivia Butterfly|Festivia]], and [[Skywynne Butterfly|Skywynne]] – outside their tapestries and gathered together.''
|-
!Queens
|[whispering] Star Butterfly.
|-
!
|''The former Queens all turn to look at Star with blank white eyes. They all step to the side to let Star pass.''
|-
!Star
|It's a grandma reunion.
|-
!Queens
|[whispering]
|-
!Star
|Uh, hello.
|-
!
|''Solaria Butterfly glares at Star.''
|-
!Star
|[nervously] Hi...
|-
!
|''Celena Butterfly stares at Star.''
|-
!Star
|What are we all looking at? [gasps]
|-
!
|''Star looks up to see her own tapestry. It depicts her destroying the magic while her parents smile at her and the monsters of Mewni cheer for her.''
|-
!Star
|My tapestry! It's finished! [gasps] Oh, my. I actually destroy the magic? So my temper tantrum was right all along!
|-
!
|''Star looks behind her. The previous Queens of Mewni have vanished and are back in their tapestries.''
|-
!Star
|And they're gone. [looks at her tapestry] Monster Castle is looking good, no Mina, and everyone is safe and happy. Okay, great! Obviously gonna go destroy the magic now! ...Wait. Where's Marco?
|-
!
|''Marco is not present in Star's tapestry.''
|-
!Star
|So... no magic means no Marco?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Actually, no magic means no Glossaryck. Marco will be fine. The magic will put him back where he belongs.
|-
!Star
|On [[Earth]]. But that's not fair! Plus, that doesn't even make sense! The magic put Marco in the lint catcher at the Mewni castle, and it put me in a shed with [[Doop-Doop (character)|Doop-Doop]], and my mom on Pie Island!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, I'm sure it had a really good reason to do that. Your mom makes really good pies.
|-
!Star
|[pounds on loom] Hey, excuse me! Excuse me! You need to change this! My boyfriend Marco – he is missing in this picture! [tearing up] Can you please just add him in there? Like, maybe holding my hand or... just...?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Star.
|-
!Star
|It's just, he... he belongs with me!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Star!
|-
!Star
|What?!
|-
!Glossaryck
|I think the tapestry is done.
|-
!Star
|[sighs, sniffles, wipes away tears, sighs] So I have to destroy the magic. I guess this means [[Toffee]] was right.
|-
!
|''Star looks at Moon's tapestry. The Toffee depicted in the tapestry turns his head to look and grin at Star.''
|-
![[Toffee]]
|Surprise!
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to the tavern. Glossaryck's eyeball appears, and Star drops out of it.''
|-
!Star
|Gah! Doh! [gasps]
|-
!Marco
|Star! Jeez, we were kinda getting worried about you.
|-
!Star
|[panting]
|-
!Marco
|Did you, uh, you figure anything out in there?
|-
!Star
|[sighs] ...I'm gonna destroy the magic.
