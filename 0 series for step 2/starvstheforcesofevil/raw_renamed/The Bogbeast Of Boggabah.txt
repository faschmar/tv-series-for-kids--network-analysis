|''Episode begins at [[Butterfly Castle]]. In her office, [[Queen Butterfly]] looks over a stack of papers.''
|-
![[Queen Butterfly|Queen Moon]]
|[sighs, leans back in her chair]
|-
!
|''[[Star Butterfly|Star]] kicks the door open with a grunt.''
|-
!Moon
|[screams, falls over]
|-
!Star
|Mama, I need to talk to you! I can't believe it!
|-
!Moon
|Star, I'm in the middle of—
|-
!
|''Star tosses all of the books and papers off of Moon's desk.''
|-
!Star
|It's blowing my beautiful mind!
|-
!Moon
|Okay. [gathering papers off the floor] I have been meaning to talk to you as well. We need to discuss what happened at the temple.
|-
!Star
|Right?! Isn't it bonkers that [[Miss Heinous|Heinous]] is [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]'s daughter?! [[Mina Loveberry|Mina]] told me everything!
|-
!Moon
|Mina? What are you talking about? Listen, I won't have you making up ridiculous stories to distract from the real issue here. The little party you threw at the Monster Temple? I told you that it was dangerous to rush the Mewman and monster relationship. You should have checked with me first.
|-
!Star
|What? No, that's not what I'm talking about! Besides, you should've checked with me before you sent [[Rhombulus]] in to storm the whole place!
|-
!Moon
|Rhombulus? I didn't send Rhombulus.
|-
!Star
|Lies!
|-
!Moon
|You barge in here with ridiculous claims about Heinous, make a mess in my office, and then call me a liar? I don't have time for this!
|-
!
|''Moon casts magic to levitate Star out of the office.''
|-
!Star
|[grunting] What?! H-Hey! No-no-no-no! I am not finished talking about this yet! What are we gonna do about Heinous?! How could you do this to your precious baby girl?!
|-
!Moon
|You're not a baby, so stop acting like one! [slams office door]
|-
!Star
|[grunts] I'm not a baby? I'll show you a baby. No! I came here to talk about Heinous, and that's just what I'm gonna do. [bumps into [[King Butterfly]]] Ugh!
|-
![[King Butterfly|King River]]
|There you go, rushing into things again.
|-
!Star
|Ugh! Dad, now is not the time! I really need to talk to Mom!
|-
!River
|[picks up Star and puts her down in front of him] Ah, you don't know what you need.
|-
!Star
|I'm sorry?
|-
!River
|But I do. [rips off his clothes] Hunting trip!
|-
!Star
|What?!
|-
!River
|Just like my father did with me, his father did with him, and his father did with him!
|-
!Star
|Just right after I talk to Mom about this—
|-
!
|''River grabs Star and carries her away from Moon's office door.''
|-
!River
|[laughs] That's what I said to my father before me, and what he said to his father before him, and his father before him, and his brother...
|-
!Star
|Uggghhh! Daaaad!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to [[Forest of Certain Death]]. River wades through a stream carrying sleeping bags, a bow, and arrows over his head.''
|-
!River
|[grunting]
|-
!Star
|Dad, what are we doing here? We have a royal family crisis on our hands!
|-
!River
|[climbs out of the stream] There's always a crisis.
|-
!Star
|[takes out compact mirror] Okay, I'm just gonna call Mom and—
|-
!River
|[grabs compact mirror] No, you don't. [eats compact mirror]
|-
!Star
|Papa, what are you doing?!
|-
!River
|[swallows] Ahhh!
|-
!Moon's voice
|[muffled in River's stomach] Hello? Hello? Star, is that you?
|-
!River
|[pokes his belly to end phone call] She's busy. Starship, listen to me. This is a very important hunt, and I want you here for it. Once it's over, you can return to your little crisis, but until then, you're all mine. Deal?
|-
!Star
|Fiiiiiine. Can we please hurry, then?
|-
!River
|As soon as we find Eddie.
|-
!Eddie
|[appears out of a bush] I'm right here!
|-
!Star and River
|Aah!
|-
!Eddie
|That's me, Eddie. I have the markings of a plant, but in fact, I'm just a regular fella.
|-
!River
|Oh! [laughs] Eddie, you old bottom dweller!
|-
!Eddie
|[chuckles] True, I am a bit of a creeper.
|-
!Star
|Yeah. You are.
|-
!Eddie
|So, what brings you to this neck of the parts?
|-
!River
|The Bogbeast of Boggabah!
|-
!Eddie
|Wow-wee. Is it that time already?
|-
!Star
|Bogbeast? [takes out her [[Star Butterfly's wand|wand]]] Sounds easy enough.
|-
!Eddie
|Ah, you're a first-timer, clearly.
|-
!River
|This is no trifle matter! The last thing you want is to face the beast ill-prepared.
|-
!Eddie
|I remember my first Bogbeast hunt. It did not go well. Well, I'll alert the others! You better get prepped! [crouches down in bush and crawls away]
|-
!Star
|How long is this gonna take?
|-
!River
|It takes as long as it takes!
|-
!Eddie
|[appears again, whispering] Listen for the Bogbeast song. That's when you know it's near.
|-
!River
|(''o.s.'') Come, Star!
|-
!Star
|[groans] Coming...
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to a tribal tent in a forest clearing.''
|-
!River
|Okay, the first ritual is to cleanse our minds of fear! [pours water on hot coals] The beast can smell your fears before you're even afraid.
|-
!Star
|Uh-huh. Okay, yeah. So what do we do first?
|-
!River
|We sweat! [lightly shaking]
|-
!Star
|O... kay. [lightly shaking]
|-
!
|''After several moments, a bead of sweat appears on River's forehead.''
|-
!River
|[strained] Look, look! I got one!
|-
!Star
|Ugh, forget this. Summoning Cloudy Charm!
|-
!
|''Star summons [[Cloudy]] to rain on her and River, flooding the tent.''
|-
!Star
|We good here?  
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to forest. River rolls up to a bunch of leaf clumps.''
|-
!River
|[spits] It's time to learn how to be one with our surroundings. [gathers leaves around himself] Voilá! The ancient skill of camouflage! But before you start, you must check every leaf carefully.
|-
!Star 
|Yeah, I have a better idea.
|-
!
|''Star uses her wand to completely cover herself with leaves.''
|-
!River
|No! You'll accidentally pick up the baby bog dragons that live there!
|-
!Star
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Five bog dragons appear in Star's coat of leaves.''
|-
!Bog dragons
|[squeaking, breathing fire]
|-
!Star
|Easy, little dragon babies.
|-
!
|[flames whoosh]
|-
!Star
|[screams]
|-
!
|''Star is covered in soot with her hair blown back. The bog dragons run away.''
|-
!Star
|[sighs] Next task!
|-
!
|''River dusts off a tree stump and pats it.''
|-
!River
|Mewman hair-braiding is very important.
|-
!Star
|Oh. [sits on stump]
|-
!River
|It teaches focus and attention to detail! [tugs on Star's hair]
|-
!Star
|Ugh! Dad!
|-
!River
|[humming and laughing]
|-
!
|''River ties Star's hair into braids.''
|-
!River
|There! [knocks Star off stump] Now do me.
|-
!Star
|[growls]
|-
!
|''Deep, low tones suddenly emerge from the deep forest.''
|-
!Star
|The Bogbeast song! Let's go get it!
|-
!River
|Honey, we must finish the rituals.
|-
!Star
|But—!
|-
!River
|Make me pretty!
|-
!Star
|Fine-fine-fine-fine! [quickly ties in a knot in River's beard] Done!
|-
!River
|Thank you, pumpkin. Next ritual!
|-
!
|''River walks away and drags along Star, who accidentally got one of her braids caught in River's beard knot.''
|-
!Star
|[grunting] Dad!
|-
!
|''River collects sap from a tree in a small wooden bowl.''
|-
!River
|Okay. The last ritual is to teach focus. [mixes leaves and twigs into sap] To protect ourselves, we must cover our bodies with ancient markings!
|-
!
|''River unrolls a small scroll with markings drawn on it.''
|-
!Star
|Ahhh! Like tattoos?
|-
!River
|No! Ancient markings!
|-
!Star
|That doesn't seem hard. And kinda cool.
|-
!River
|[dips stick into sap] Dip the stick. Careful. Slowly.
|-
!
|''As Star holds up the scroll, River draws markings on his arms.''
|-
!River
|There we are!
|-
!Star
|Way ahead of you!
|-
! 
|''Star has a crude, splattered mess of sap on her arm.''
|-
!Star
|Fascinating! Can we start the hunt now?
|-
!River
|Yes! Just one hundred more scrolls to go! [unrolls another, much larger scroll]
|-
!Star
|[gasps, groans]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Star drawing markings on River's back.''
|-
!River
|Make sure you get the curve. Don't forget the curve at the end.
|-
!Star
|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Got the curve. There, I'm done!
|-
!River
|Very good, milkshake! Now, let's see what you—
|-
!
|''The top of River's back reads "BOY BEATZ" in sap.''
|-
!River
|"Boy Beatz"? [laughs] That's supposed to say "Bogbeast"! Ha! I'm afraid we'll have to start all over.
|-
!Star
|What?! [flustered groan] All right, I'll get the ink, and then—
|-
!River
|Oh, no. I mean ''all'' over. From the very beginning! Tallyho-ho! [runs off-screen]
|-
!Star
|[whispering] Whaaaaat? Ugh.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts from Star and River forcing themselves to sweat in the tent, to covering themselves in leaves, to braiding their hair, to painting markings on their bodies again.''
|-
!Star
|[panting] Okay! We sweated, we camouflaged, we braided, and we protected our bodies with ancient scroll thingies! I... am... ready!
|-
!River
|Wait! I'll tell you if you're ready or not! Look into my eyes.
|-
!
|''Star and River stare into each other's eyes.''
|-
!River
|Hmm... Mm-hmm... Yes. You are ready! [back cracks] Ack! My back! Don't worry. This happens all the time. Just need to sit down. [lies down on sleeping bag]
|-
!Star
|But I'm ready!
|-
!River
|[zips up sleeping bag] Actually, no, you're not. I lied. Just as my father lied to me, and his father lied to him, and his father lied. He was a liar. Now, come lay down, and we'll start over fresh in the morning. [snores]
|-
!Star
|What?! You're asleep?! Ugh! Okay. [climbs into sleeping bag]
|-
!
|''Wind whistles through the forest. The Bogbeast's song echoes again, and Star's eyes open pop open.''
|-
!Star
|He's here. That's it!
|-
!
|''Star bursts out of her sleeping bag in a new outfit.''
|-
!Star
|Bogbeast, I'm coming for you!
|-
!
|''Various accessories magically appear on Star's outfit, giving her the appearance of a huntress. Her wand transform into a bow.''
|-
!Star
|[screaming] Bogbeast! [runs into a muddy bog] Yow! Ugh! Oh! Are you kidding me?! I don't have time for this!
|-
!
|''The Bogbeast's song echoes once again.''
|-
!Star
|What the? Ugh!
|-
!
|''Star fires an arrow behind her and gets even more stuck in the mud.''
|-
!Star
|[grunting] Uh... Hello? Hello? Who is there?
|-
!
|''Mud is suddenly thrown in Star's face.''
|-
!Star
|[groans] Bogbeast, is that you?
|-
!
|''Star sinks further into the mud, and her wand sinks completely.''
|-
!Star
|No!
|-
!
|''A shadowy figure with antlers approaches from behind Star.''
|-
!Star
|Don't— Don't— Don't come any closer! [screaming] 
|-
!
|''Someone puts a crown of antlers on Star's head.''
|-
!Star
|What? Huh?
|-
!
|''River appears next to Star wearing a pair of stump shoes.''
|-
!River
|Greetings, all! [laughing] I present you the Bogbeast of Boggabah!
|-
!
|''A crowd of [[Mewmans]] appear around the bog, cheering. Some start playing bluegrass music. One blows a horn that sounds like the Bogbeast's song.''
|-
!Star
|Dad?
|-
!
|''Mud is thrown in Star's face again.''
|-
!River
|Congratulations, pumpkin! [laughs]
|-
!Star
|Uh... [chuckles] What? Me? I am not the Bogbeast.
|-
!River
|Of course you are! We've all been the Bogbeast at one point or another! Old Eddie here has even been the Bogbeast twice!
|-
!Eddie
|[laughs] I never learn!
|-
!River
|Being impulsive and running into situations headfirst without thinking is your specialty, dear. But it's also what makes a Bogbeast. You have so much greatness in you. I don't want anything to stand in your way, especially yourself. Please remember this hunt always.
|-
!Star
|[hugs River] I will, Dad.
|-
!Mewman
|Bog party, everybody!
|-
!River
|Sorry, not this time. I promised Star we'd go home. She has stuff that she needs to do.
|-
!Crowd
|Awww...
|-
!Star
|You know what? My stuff can wait 'til morning. I think I can squeeze a little bog party in.
|-
!River
|''Bog party!''
|-
!Crowd
|[cheering, playing music]
|-
!
|''Star, River, and the Mewmans start dancing. Scene cuts to next day at Butterfly Castle. Star walks up to Moon's office door covered in mud.''
|-
!Star
|[sighs] Okay. [knocks on door]
