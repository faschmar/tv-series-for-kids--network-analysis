|''Episode begins at a temple at the top of a mountain. The large rats from the [[Mewni]] porridge tavern carry stone blocks and building tools up the template stairs and raise large stone pillars.''
|-
![[Ludo]]
|Hyah! Mush! Mush! Hyah!
|-
!
|''Ludo rides toward the temple on a carriage of rats. The other rats bow to him as he passes by.''
|-
!Ludo
|Hello! Yes!
|-
!
|''He goes to the temple's lowest level, where his [[bald eagle]] and [[giant spider]] companions lie in front of a dungeon door. At the bottom of the stairs, Ludo unbuckles his "seatbelt".''
|-
!Ludo
|I have arrived. Did you keep him up all night?
|-
!Eagle and spider
|[nod their heads]
|-
!Ludo
|You haven't fed him, have you?
|-
!Eagle and spider
|[shake their heads]
|-
!Ludo
|Good! Then he must be about to crack. [takes out [[Ludo's wand|wand]]] Time to turn up the heat.
|-
!Wand
|[low humming]
|-
!Ludo
|What's that? [to eagle and spider] Um, hold on a minute. I have to take this. [walks away a few feet, whispers] What? Yes. Oh, of course. That'll be our last resort, heh-heh.
|-
!Eagle and spider
|[look at each other]
|-
!
|''Ludo enters the dungeon. There's a lump on the far bed under the covers.''
|-
!Ludo
|Well, well, well! How do you like my monster temple? Pretty cool, huh? My wand told me where to find it.
|-
!
|''Window shutters above Ludo burst open.''
|-
!Ludo
|Aah!
|-
!
|''[[Glossaryck]] lies on the windowsill in his underwear, looking down at Ludo.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Hellooo...
|-
!Ludo
|What are you doing?
|-
!Glossaryck
|I was just out for my morning stroll.
|-
!Ludo
|But then who is in your bed?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh-oh-oh! Um... Easy. [chuckles] Easy. Don't shoot. It's, uh... It's just my robe. [puts robe on]
|-
!Ludo
|[to eagle and spider] Girls! Bring me the book!
|-
!Eagle and spider
|[carry in [[Magic Instruction Book]]]
|-
!Ludo
|[to Ludo] I want you to teach me this... [points at book] ...to make me awesome at this! [points at wand] You will not resist! Resistance is pointless!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Uh, you mind hopping off?
|-
!Ludo
|[gets off book]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Thank you. [opens book] Okay! Let's get started!
|-
!Ludo
|But... you're not going to resist? Even a little resistance?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Look, it's your book now. I'm just here to help you. Or not. Up to you.
|-
!Ludo
|Really? You ''want'' to teach me?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, yes. Sure.
|-
!Ludo
|What's your game? You must want something.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, I don't have wants. I have a job. And that job is to help you reach your ultimate potential with this.
|-
!Ludo
|Well, then... Pudding! Someone just earned themselves some pudding. You, little man, you are going to make me the most powerful being in the universe! [laughing]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, slow, slow, slow your roll. Look, all I can promise is to help you reach your full potential.
|-
!Ludo
|Oh, goody! Is it going to be hard?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Mmm... Could be.
|-
!Ludo
|Exhausting?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Mmm... Quite possibly.
|-
!Ludo
|Almost unendurable?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Uh... Well, do you want it to be?
|-
!Ludo
|Oh, yes! I so want it to be!
|-
!
|''Scene changes to temple exterior; Ludo pushes the book up a hill.''
|-
!Ludo
|[straining]
|-
!
|''He paddles the book across a moat.''
|-
!Ludo
|Stroke! Stroke!
|-
!
|''He carries the book down a hill.''
|-
!Ludo
|[grunting]
|-
!
|''He drags the book across the ground until he reaches Glossaryck, reading a newspaper.''
|-
!Ludo
|[grunting, panting] This... is so hard! When are we going to start doing spells?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Whenever you want.
|-
!Ludo
|What?! Are you kidding me?! What was all of this?!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, this? Well, I was only doing that because you said you wanted it to be really hard.
|-
!Ludo
|I don't know what I want! I've never done this before! You know what my dad taught me about making my way in the world? Nothing! Zip! I was one egg out of fifty! Everything I've learned, I had to learn dirty!
|-
!Glossaryck
|[folds newspaper into paper airplane]
|-
!Ludo
|But for once in my life, I'd like... some guidance.
|-
!Glossaryck
|[tosses paper airplane] Okay. We can do that.
|-
!Ludo
|Really?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to temple; Ludo and Glossaryck go to the top of the stairs.''
|-
!Ludo
|So when am I going to learn a Narwhal Blast? Pshew-pshew-pshew!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, oh. Oh, that. Yes, well, mm-hmm... You see, Star made that up. It's not in the book. She just used her imagination for most things.
|-
!Ludo
|Ooh! What's an imagination?
|-
!Glossaryck
|[sighs] Okay. Well, let's start with the basics. [snaps fingers]
|-
!
|''The book of spells rolls up the stairs and stops in front of Ludo. Glossaryck opens it.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Let's see... [mumbling, opens book to [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]'s chapter] Oh, that's probably a little too advanced. [opens book to Chapter One] Okay, okay... [mumbling, opens book to Levitato page] Oh! Here we go. Uh, why don't you take a look here? Now note the stance and posture. Basically, you're going to want to put your arm out and your feet... ahem... less out. You got that?
|-
!Ludo
|Okay. [straining]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Hmm... [positions Ludo's right arm a little higher] Hmm... [positions Ludo's left arm a little lower, pulls on Ludo's eyelids] Would you just relax?
|-
!Ludo
|Oh.
|-
!Glossaryck
|We're going to start with some simple object transfer. Let's have you try... LLLLLLevitato.
|-
!Ludo
|[reading] Levitato...
|-
!Glossaryck
|Now, when you're ready, I want you to bring me that apple.
|-
!Ludo
|What apple?
|-
!Glossaryck
|That one.
|-
!
|''An apple poofs onto a flat stone across from Ludo and Glossaryck.''
|-
!Ludo
|[raises wand] Levitato. ... [shakes wand] Levitato—!
|-
!
|''A green blast of magic shoots out of the wand and burns the apple to ashes.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|[sighing] O-kay.
|-
!Ludo
|Oh! You see that?! How am I supposed to work with this?! I listen to my wand, but it never listens to me.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Look, kid, it's your first try. Don't worry about it. [snaps fingers]
|-
!
|''Another apple appears in the same spot as the first.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|We'll just try again. Relax.
|-
!Ludo
|[inhales] Levitato!
|-
!
|''The wand shoots another green magic blast that drags a rat carrying building tools up into the air.''
|-
!Rat
|[squeals]
|-
!Ludo
|Levi—!
|-
!Glossaryck
|[stops Ludo] Okay, okay. No, no. No. No. Stop. Look, you're really being sloppy. You need to really feel it. Say it with conviction. LLLLLLLLevitato!
|-
!Ludo
|Lev-i-tato.
|-
!
|''The apple levitates.''
|-
!Ludo
|It worked. Huh. Levitato.
|-
!
|''Ludo pulls his wand to the left, and the apple flies to the left. Glossaryck catches it.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Hey! Now you're getting it. Nice job.
|-
!Ludo
|Am I better than Star?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Well, I... Well, I guess you're better at following the spell book.
|-
!Ludo
|Are you... proud of me?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Yeah, um... Yeah, you're doing fine.
|-
!Ludo
|Could you say "proud of me", though?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Uh... huh. Uh... [chuckles] I'm proud of you.
|-
!Ludo
|[giggling giddily]
|-
!
|''Ludo uses Levitato to levitate the book of spells uphill, over the moat, and back downhill. Scene changes to Glossaryck eating chocolate pudding.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Hmm.
|-
!Ludo
|[using magic on rocks on the ground] Levitato. Levitato.
|-
!Glossaryck
|[points to pudding cups]
|-
!Ludo
|Levitato. [catches pudding cup in his hand]
|-
!
|''Glossaryck guzzles chocolate pudding, and Ludo imitates him. In the next scene, Ludo uses Levitato on eight apples at once.''
|-
!Ludo
|Levitato.
|-
!
|''The apples float down into a circle around Glossaryck.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|[gives thumbs-up] Yep.
|-
!Ludo
|[gives thumbs-up]
|-
!
|''At sunset, Ludo settles into bed, with Glossaryck at his bedside.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|And you see, it's a complex theory behind the levitations...
|-
!Ludo
|Levitato. [levitates bed covers onto him]
|-
!Glossaryck
|...you'll be performing as a magic user.
|-
!Ludo
|Levitato! [levitates glass of water and drinks from it]
|-
!Glossaryck
|And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
|-
!Ludo
|Levitato. [levitates candlestick]
|-
!Glossaryck
|You'd better get some sleep. You have a lot of work to do tomorrow.
|-
!Ludo
|Levitato. [sets candlestick down]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Might even learn a second spell or something.
|-
!Ludo
|This was a really great day, Glossaryck.
|-
!Glossaryck
|I'm sure it was.
|-
!Ludo
|Will you tuck me in?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Um, well, I... Uh, okay. [tucks Ludo under the covers]
|-
!Ludo
|And my wand.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Uh...
|-
!Ludo
|[excited chuckle]
|-
!Glossaryck
|[tucks Ludo's wand into bed] Ahem... there you go.
|-
!Ludo
|And pat my head?
|-
!Glossaryck
|[pats Ludo's head] Pat-pat-pat. See you in the morning.
|-
!Ludo
|And say, "Good night, my darling."
|-
!Glossaryck
|Are you kidding me...? Um, good night.
|-
!Ludo
|"My darling".
|-
!Glossaryck
|Um, uh... My-my... My darling. [picks up book of spells and floats away]
|-
!
|''Scene transitions from Ludo's candlestick burning bright to melted and burned out.''
|-
!Eagle and spider
|[snoring]
|-
!Rats
|[snoring]
|-
!Ludo
|[to wand, whispering] Are you still awake? I can't sleep either! I'm too excited to sleep! Today was wonderful!
|-
!Wand
|[low humming]
|-
!Ludo
|Why would you say that? Glossaryck is proud of me. He said I was better than Star!
|-
!Wand
|[low humming]
|-
!Ludo
|What do you mean, he showed her something hidden? Don't be silly! We just started. I'm sure we'll get to it soon.
|-
!Wand
|[low humming]
|-
!Ludo
|He kept it from me on purpose?
|-
!Wand
|[low humming]
|-
!Ludo
|No. No, no, no, no. He'd never lie to me!
|-
!
|''Ludo picks up the wand and runs toward the book of spells.''
|-
!Ludo
|[panting] Levitato! [levitates himself over short steps] Glossaryck! [knocks on book's cover] Wake up!
|-
!
|''The book opens to a page that Glossaryck is lying and eating pudding on.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Didn't we just do bedtime?
|-
!Ludo
|Glossaryck. I know this is crazy, but my wand told me... [chuckling] It's my... my wand, he told me there's a chapter in this book that you've shown Star that you haven't shown me. But that's crazy, right?
|-
!Glossaryck
|No, it's true.
|-
!Ludo
|What?! Why didn't you show me?!
|-
!Glossaryck
|You know, you didn't ask.
|-
!Ludo
|Well, I want to see it!
|-
!Glossaryck
|[sighs] You want to see it. You want to see... Well, you know, I don't know. It's ''really'' advanced. Um, you know, dark stuff.
|-
!Ludo
|Did you show it to Star?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Um, technically, I didn't ''show'' her, but, uh, she ''has'' seen it.
|-
!Ludo
|''Show me!''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Okay, it's your book. [flips book's pages to Eclipsa's chapter]
|-
!Ludo
|Secret chapter...! [chuckles] Unlock it!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Are you truly sure? It could taint you.
|-
!Ludo
|Oh, I got plenty of taint already. Now unlock it!
|-
!Glossaryck
|[sighs] As you wish.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck uses a key on his left big toe to unlock Eclipsa's chapter. The skull-shaped lock's jaw lowers, then the whole lock flies off the page. Ludo turns the first page into the chapter.''
|-
!Ludo
|H...mm! I thought there'd be more pict—
|-
!
|''A burst of black smoke drags Ludo into the air.''
|-
!Ludo
|Aah! Ohhh!
|-
!
|''Ludo floats at the center of a black magical void. His wand's face plate glows green. Ludo opens his eyes to reveal swirling pools of green energy, and he smiles.''
|-
!Ludo
|[<nowiki />[[Toffee]]'s voice] Hello, Glossaryck.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Hello... Toffee.
|-
!Ludo (Toffee)
|Time to give it up, old man. You'll never get him on your side.
|-
!Glossaryck
|But I don't have a side.
|-
!Ludo (Toffee)
|You don't, do you? [chuckles] Excellent.
|-
!
|''Screen fades to black around Ludo/Toffee's eyes, then Ludo/Toffee's eyes's fade to black.''
