| ''Scene opens with a shot of the Mewni Castle. [[Star Butterfly]] is feeding [[Glossaryck]] pudding.''
|-
!Star
| Ready, Glossaryck? Here comes the airplane. [makes airplane noises]
|-
!Glossaryck
| [[Globgor]], Globgor.
|-
!Star
| Come on, Glossaryck. Be a good boy.
|-
!
| ''Glossaryck throws the bowl of pudding at Star's face.''
|-
!Star
| Glossaryck, what have I told you? We express ourselves with our words, not our pudding.
|-
!
| ''Glossaryck tilts his chair over, jumps out, and takes off running on all fours.''
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor!
|-
!Star
| [gasps] Oh, Glossaryck. Here, boy. Do you wanna...
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor?
|-
!Star
| [holds up a leash] ...go for a walk?
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor!
|-
!
| ''Scene skips ahead. Glossaryck is running on Star's leash. Star is struggling to keep up.''
|-
!Star
| Glossaryck, slow down!
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor, Globgor.
|-
!
| ''Star yells. They stop temporarily.''
|-
!Star
| Glossaryck, what the heck?
|-
!
| ''Glossaryck sniffs a painting. He then holds up his leg as if he were about to urinate on it.''
|-
!Star
| Stop that, bad Glossaryck. Are we gonna have to go back into the diaper, 'cause I will do it.
|-
!
| ''Glossaryck sees a squirrelicorn, and takes off running.''
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor!
|-
!Star
| Aaaaah, Glossaryck!
|-
!
| ''The leash rips as Glossaryck jumps out the window.''
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor!
|-
!Star
| No!
|-
!
| ''Glossaryck continues pursuit of the squirrelicorn in a garden outside. He chases it through a bush, and leaps into the air after it, but is then caught by an arm.''
|-
!Star
| Whoa, Glossaryck! Heh, oh my goodness, I am so sorry about your roses. He'd... oh!
|-
!Eclipsa
| Oh don't worry. They're just flowers. It's not like they're something really cool, like a squirrelicorn. [to Glossaryck] Isn't that right?
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor! Globgor, Globgor.
|-
!
| ''Eclipsa pokes Glossaryck's forehead jewel, causing it to light up. Glossaryck suddenly becomes less hyper.''
|-
!Glossaryck
| What... Oh!
|-
!Star
| How did you do that, and teach it to me now.
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]
| [laughs] He just looked like he needed a little head scratch.
|-
!Glossaryck
| [quietly] Globgor.
|-
!Eclipsa
| You know, once in a while, you've got to slow down and appreciate the feeling of a nice head scratch, or the smell of a freshly bloomed rose, or the taste of a delicious candy bar.
|-
!
| ''Eclipsa takes out a chocolate bar and eats it. She throws the wrapper into a bucket filled with many similar wrappers.''
|-
!Eclipsa
| I might have some self-control issues.
|-
!Star + Eclipsa
| [laughs]
|-
!Star
| Yeah, me, too. [laughs] You seem so familiar. We've met before, right?
|-
!Eclipsa
| Maybe. I used to visit this garden a lot. Oh-oh, have you been to the Rose Tower? [points] The view of the garden is absolutely divine.
|-
!Star
| Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That's been condemned for forever.
|-
!Eclipsa
| Well, don't let that stop you.
|-
!Star
| [giggles] Hey, if you're around tonight, you should come to the royal dinner.
|-
!Eclipsa
| Oh, that sounds delightful. But I may have other plans.
|-
!Star
| Aw. You got a hot date?
|-
!Eclipsa
| Something like that.
|-
!
| ''[[Queen Butterfly]] and the [[Magic High Commission]] burst down the castle door and enter the garden.''
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Star!
|-
!Star
| Mom!
|-
!
| ''Omnitraxus Prime smashes his way to Eclipsa and pins her to the wall.''
|-
!Star
| Omnitraxus!
|-
!
| ''The other guards run over to him.''
|-
!Star
| What is going on?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| [gasping] Star, are you okay? Did she hurt you?
|-
!Star
| What? No. No one hurt me. I was just talking to that nice lady.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Nice lady? Star, that's Eclipsa.
|-
!Eclipsa
| Oh. Long time, no speak, Moon. How did that spell work out for you?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Not another word out of you, Eclipsa.
|-
!Star
| That's Eclipsa!?
|-
!
| ''Scene transitions. Star is standing in a shower where (presumably) water is being dumped onto her.''
|-
![[Hekapoo]]
| We need to decontaminate you.
|-
!
| ''Star shivers, then lets out a yelp as Hekapoo holds up an otoscope to her face.''
|-
!Hekapoo
| Look into the light, please.
|-
!Star
| What?
|-
!Hekapo
| Uh, to check for spots of evil.
|-
!Star
| Spots of evil?
|-
!Hekapoo
| Well, there's no telling what Eclipsa might have done to you.
|-
!Star
| Stop it. I am telling you, Eclipsa didn't do anything to me. I am fine.
|-
!
| ''[[Rhombulus]] pulls up a wheel chair and bumps Star into it.''
|-
!Star
| What? Uff. What are you d... hey!
|-
!
| ''Star is dropped of by [[Omnitraxus Prime]] who stands ready next to an eye chart.''
|-
!Omnitraxus
| Cover your left eye with the paddle, and read the lines as best you can.
|-
!Star
| I-A-M-E-V-I- what no you don't. That just spells "I am evil."
|-
!Rhombulus
| That was, like, totally an admission.
|-
!Star
| What? No, I was right. This is rigged. I was reading the thing.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Skin check. [looks at Star's arm] Oh, dear. Have you always had this mole?
|-
!Star
| Yes, but it doesn't make me evil. Just a little self-conscious sometimes. And why is there a monkey?
|-
!
| ''Indeed, there is a monkey now examining Star's hair.''
|-
!Hekapoo
| To check for evil fleas.
|-
!Star
| Evil fleas?
|-
!Monkey
| [screeches]
|-
!Hekapoo
| [gasps] He found something.
|-
!
| ''The monkey takes out a flea and eats it.''
|-
!Hekapoo
| Never mind. He says they're just regular fleas.
|-
!Star
| I knew that.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Stand here, arms down.
|-
!
| ''They put Star on an operating table.''
|-
!Hekapoo
| One moment.
|-
!
| ''Hekapoo staps Star to the table.''
|-
!Star
| Hey! What? Do you even know what you're doing?
|-
!
| ''Rhombulus sticks two probes on Star's heart cheeks.''
|-
!Rhombulus
| No, but we still gotta do a test. [screaming] Are you evil?
|-
!Star
| [groans] No!
|-
!
| ''The machine buzzes and displays a signal''
|-
!Hekapoo
| Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
|-
!Rhombulus
| Are you evil, are you evil, are you evil?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Is she all right?
|-
!Star
| I am fine. I talked to Eclipsa for, like, two seconds, and she was really nice. No big deal.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| It could be a very big deal.
|-
!Star
| Okay, fine, but why?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Star, she betrayed her kingdom. She abandoned her people so she could run off with a monster.
|-
!Star
| Mm-hmm, yes, right. I knew that. Kinda selfish. Okay, then what? She blew everything up?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| No. They crystallized her before she had the chance.
|-
!Star
| Wa-wa-wait, you crystallized her for being in love?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| To a monster. And that's not all. She didn't respect the natural order. She meddled in the dark arts, and created her own chapter of dangerous evil magic.
|-
!Star
| Have you ever even read it?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| [scoffs] Of course not.
|-
!Star
| Well I have, and it really wasn't that big of a deal.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Ugh. [to commission] Chime in any time, guys. You knew her, too.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Uh, I mean, I saw her double-dipping in the ranch at the royal ball once.
|-
!Omnitraxus
| She told me she thought Rhombulus was annoying.
|-
!Rhombulus
| Can you believe it?
|-
!Star
| Yes.
|-
!Rhombulus
| Oh, yeah. She totally used to eat babies!
|-
!Hekapoo
| Nope, nope, that wasn't Eclipsa. That was Bobipsa, the barbarian baby eater.
|-
!Rhombulus
| Are you calling me a liar?
|-
!Omnitraxus
| I'm pretty sure Eclipsa was a pescaterian.
|-
!Star
| Okay, guys, as fascinating and fact-filled as this conversation is, I'm feeling kinda done. The tests say I'm fine.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Star, please, these tests are for your own good.
|-
!Star
| Ugh! I am good. And, it sounds like Eclipsa didn't deserve to be crystallized. I mean, what's next, you gonna crystallize me if I do something you don't approve of?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| [to Commission] Give us the room.
|-
!
| ''The others leave and Queen Butterfly unstraps Star from the operating table.''
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| You know, when I first met Eclipsa, I trusted her, too. I didn't know any better. Truthfully, Star, you're very capable for your age, but–
|-
!Star
| Then why won't anyone listen to me?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| It's complicated. Eclipsa can be very... convincing. For your safety, let me handle this.
|-
!Star
| So what are you gonna do?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| I'm afraid the only option is immediate re-crystallization.
|-
!Star
| What? No. No, no, no, no. That's so harsh. You can't just go crystallizing–
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| This isn't a debate, Star. I gave my orders to the Magic High Commission, and they're on their way to her cell as we speak. She's to be re-crystallized immediately.
|-
!
| ''Queen Butterfly exits the room.''
|-
!Star
| Oh-ho-ho, we'll see about that.
|-
!
| ''Star walks out of the room. Glossaryck is in a room down the hallway, along with Star's wand.''
|-
!Glossaryck
| Oh, Globgor!
|-
!Star
| My wand!
|-
!
| ''She checks the door.''
|-
!Star
| Locked! Glossaryck.
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor.
|-
!Star
| [banging on door] Glossaryck!
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor?
|-
!Star
| [whispering] Glossaryck, the wand.
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor? [picks his nose]
|-
!Star
| [facepalms, traces a wand with her fingers] Wand.
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor!
|-
!
| ''Glossaryck leaves the window. The door knob starts rattling.''
|-
!Star
| Good boy, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
|-
!
| ''The door opens. Glossaryck is floating mid-air holding the wand.''
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor.
|-
!
| ''He then immediately flies of screen with lightning speed while sticking his tounge out at Star.''
|-
!Star
| [chasing him] No, Glossaryck. We have to save Eclipsa.
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps to Eclipsa in her holding cell, then back to Star + Glossaryck in the hallway''
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor.
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps to Queen Butterfly and the Magic High Commission, also in that hallway. Scene jumps back to Glossaryck who's sticking his tounge out at Star. Star runs up and grabs him''
|-
!Star
| Gotcha. Super sparkle cloudy.
|-
!Cloudy
| Aaahhhhhhhh!
|-
!
| ''The three race down the hallway, catching up to the Commission as they open the door.''
|-
!Cloudy
| Weeeeee!
|-
!Rhombulus
| I'm gonna enjoy this.
|-
!Star
| Rhombulus, no! wait!
|-
!
| ''Star crashes into Rhombulus as he fires his crystal blast, causing it to ricochet off the walls, floor, and ceiling.''
|-
!High Commission
| Aaah!
|-
!Rhombulus
| Oh geez.
|-
!Hekapoo
| Turn it off!
|-
!
| ''The spell hits Rhombulus in his butt, causing small crystals to grow out of it.''
|-
!Rhombulus
| Ahhhggg! Ow! OWIE! Great... Now I got crystals growing outta my–
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Well, Star, you've caused quite the ruckus.
|-
!Star
| Will you all just listen to me for one second? Crystallizing people is a serious punishment, and so far, no one has been able to convince me that Eclipsa deserves it.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Star, I know Eclipsa seems nice, but she can get into your head and make you do things you don't want to do.
|-
!Star
| Oh, my goodness, you're right. Giving you that spell to destroy Toffee was her idea. Oh, no, wait. You were the one who went to her for help.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| All right, yes, but...
|-
!Star
| And you made a deal with her. When Toffee was destroyed, she'd be set free. Well, hey, Toffee's gone, and you wanna go back on your word?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| But Star, look what her spell did to me.
|-
!
| ''Queen Butterfly takes over her right glove, revealing her purple hand and darkened veins.''
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| When I performed that spell, I could feel the darkness. Eclipsa is evil, Star. I know you don't believe it now, but if you wait to find out the truth for yourself, it'll be too late.
|-
!Star
| Okay, fine. If she is as bad as you say she is, then put her in a crystal. But she at least deserves to have a fair trial.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| [agitated] Oh, for goodness sake, fine. We'll have a trial.
|-
!Star
| Ah, Yes! [dancing] Due process, due process.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| But I'm only allowing this because I want there to be no doubt amongst anyone in Mewni—I'm looking at you, Star—that Eclipsa is evil and deserves her fate.
|-
!Star
| See Eclipsa? Around here, we believe in a little thing called the justice system.
|-
!
| ''The Commission begins to leave''
|-
!Star
| Hey, where are you going?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Well it's going to take a little time to get the trial all set up.
|-
!Star
| What? No, you can't just leave her chained up in this dark and smelly dungeon.
|-
!Eclipsa
| You know, I always did enjoy gazing at the roses.
|-
!
| ''Scene changes to the rose tower above the garden. Star approaches the tower.''
|-
!Guard
| Oh, hello, Princess Butterfly.
|-
!Star
| Stand aside.
|-
!
| ''The guard stands aside, and the other begins unlocking the multi-locked door. Star sighs, and then just opens all the locks with her wand.''
|-
!Star
| Eclipsa.
|-
!Eclipsa
| Star. I was hoping you'd–
|-
!Star
| Don't move. I gonna need some answers. Did you or did you not mess with dark magic?
|-
!Eclipsa
| Well... I did what I had to do for me. If the Magic High Commission and your mother think that's evil, call me a villainess.
|-
!Star
| Wait. Are you in my mind? They said you could be in my mind, and I wouldn't even know.
|-
!Eclipsa
| Definitely not. But if I were, I wouldn't tell you. [silence] That's a joke.
|-
!Star
| Oh [nervous laugh], it wasn't very funny. But that's okay, 'cause...
|-
!
| ''Star reaches for a brown bag and opens it to reveal Glossaryck.''
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor. Globgor!
|-
!
| ''Glossaryck jumps on to Eclipsa's face.''
|-
!Eclipsa
| Glossaryck! Good to see you.
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor!
|-
!Star
| He's, uh, he's been kind of a handful lately. [chuckles] Could you maybe do that little crystal-y tickly thing again?
|-
!Eclipsa
| Are you sure.
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor, Globgor.
|-
!Eclipsa
| I might corrupt him.
|-
!Star
| What?! [nervous laughter] That was another joke. Ha ha. Right?
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor?
|-
!
| ''Eclipsa touches his forehead''
|-
!Glossaryck
| Globgor.
|-
!Star
| Aw, they're so sweet when they're sleeping. Okay, listen, just because I didn't want you crystallized again doesn't mean I trust you. I just want you to be treated fairly. Although, this place doesn't exactly seem fair. What in the rodent is that?!
|-
!
| ''Eclipsa's bed is full of angry critters.''
|-
!Eclipsa
| Well, I love it here. Actually, this was my room, you know, back in the, well, you know, before. A lot has changed. But the most important thing is still the same.
|-
!
| ''Eclipsa walks to the window and pulls back the curtain, revealing a view of the garden.''
|-
!Star
| Ah! Wow! This view is incredible.
|-
!Eclipsa
| Isn't it?
|-
!
| ''([[Shining Star|end song]])''
