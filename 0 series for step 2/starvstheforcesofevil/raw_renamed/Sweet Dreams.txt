|''Episode begins with [[Star Butterfly|Star]] flying through the clouds. Multiple flying Goblin Dogs appear around her.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|[gasps] Goblin Dogs? Goblin Dog family?! Whee!
|-
!
|''The Goblin Dogs follow Star through the sky. One of the Goblin Dogs has a face.''
|-
!Goblin Dog
|Star! Star! Will you please eat me?
|-
!Star
|Don't mind if I do! [eats Goblin Dog]
|-
!Goblin Dog
|[laughing]
|-
!Goblin Dogs
|Eat me now, Star!<br />Eat me!<br />Eat all of us!<br />[laughter]
|-
!
|''Star keeps eating Goblin Dogs as she flies. Cut to Star sleeping in bed and chewing on her pillow.''
|-
!Star
|[chewing noises, wakes up] Pleh! What a satisfying and filling dream.
|-
!
|''Someone knocks on Star's door.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Star, are you up? [holds out box of [[Captain Blanche's Sugar Seeds]]] It's time for breakfast! I found Captain Blanche's Sugar Seeds here on [[Mewni]]. They have an importer.
|-
!Star
|[yawns] Nah, I'm all good. I just had the most ''amazing'' dream where I was flying, and then there were all these Goblin Dogs that were also flying, and then I ate them. [burps] Ew. Smells like Goblin Dogs.
|-
!Marco
|Uh, Star, what are all those?
|-
!
|''Multiple Goblin Dog wrappers are in Star's bed.''
|-
!Star
|What the...? Goblin Dog wrappers?!
|-
!Marco
|You've been sneaking out to the Goblin Dog truck without me?
|-
!Star
|No, no, no! I swear, I am not—! [burps up Goblin Dogs receipt] Ew! A receipt? I ''did'' go to that dimension! In my sleep?
|-
!Marco
|How is that possible?
|-
!Star
|I have... no idea.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to [[Butterfly Castle]] again, at night.''
|-
!Star
|Okay, Marco, you know the plan. You stay up all night and see if whatever happened last night happens again tonight.
|-
!Marco
|But then what? Shouldn't we tell somebody about this? I mean... I mean, what if—
|-
!Star
|Marco? Shall I remind you you are my squire? So I order you to sit there and watch me sleep.
|-
!Marco
|Okay.
|-
!Star
|Good. [turns off lamp and goes to bed] Oh, and don't tell [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]] about this, either.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, heck no.
|-
!Star
|Good! Good night.
|-
!
|''[[Glossaryck]] jumps into Marco's lap.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah! Glossaryck!
|-
!Glossaryck
|[yawns] [[Globgor]]... [goes to sleep]
|-
!Marco
|All right, but just for a little while. You're so... warm... and cozy.
|-
!
|''Cut to some time later; Marco has dozed off in his chair.''
|-
!Marco
|[sleepy muttering, snoring]
|-
!
|''Marco's head slumps onto Glossaryck.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Wha! Whoa! [jumps out of Marco's lap]
|-
!Marco
|Star?!
|-
!
|''A [[dimensional portal]] is open on Star's bed. Star, in her [[Mewberty (phase)|mewberty]] form, emerges from the portal.''
|-
!Marco
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Star eats a Goblin Dog and pulls the entire Goblin Dog truck up through the portal.''
|-
!Truck
|[playing music]
|-
!
|''The portal closes, and Star drops the truck on the floor. Star lands on the floor, returns to her normal form, and falls over asleep.''
|-
!Marco
|[shakes Star] Star, wake up!
|-
!Star
|[wakes up, giggles] Hey, buddy.
|-
!Marco
|There's definitely something weird going on.
|-
![[Roy]]
|[panting]
|-
!Star
|Marco, what happened?
|-
!Marco
|I might've dozed off for a minute, but when I opened my eyes, you had opened a portal and gone through it.
|-
!Star
|Without [[dimensional scissors]]?
|-
!Marco
|You came out of the portal as that big scary thing you turned into when you defeated [[Toffee]].
|-
!Star
|Well, that shouldn't be happening.
|-
!
|''Cut to next morning. Star, Marco, [[King Butterfly]], and [[Queen Butterfly]] are seated at the breakfast table.''
|-
!Star
|So, Mom! You know that big butterfly thing you can transform into when you get all mad and feel like scaring people?
|-
![[Queen Butterfly|Queen Moon]]
|It's not for scaring people, Star.
|-
!Star
|Right. Right, right, right. So, does that ever happen... unintentionally?
|-
!Moon
|Well, it starts with mewberty. Nut after that, it requires years of training.
|-
!Star
|Oh, good. Good, good, good. But what if it just sort of happened... randomly?
|-
!Moon
|Star, it doesn't happen randomly. Okay? It happens... in times of need. Like when you defeated Toffee.
|-
!Star
|But what if it... ''did'' happen randomly?
|-
![[King Butterfly|King River]]
|Catastrophe! [laughing] Yes! We'd have to put you in the dungeon!
|-
!Moon
|River—
|-
!River
|No! Then the [[Magic High Commission|Magical High Commission]] would come and take you away! There'd be weeks of examinations. You'd be locked away forever! [chortles]
|-
!Star
|[sinks low in her seat]
|-
!Moon
|River, please.
|-
!River
|I mean, if this happened, eventually we'd just have to adopt a new princess.
|-
!Moon
|River, enough! Star, is everything all right?
|-
!Star
|Oh! [nervous laugh] Yes. Everything is totally normal, obviously. I was just asking so that I can be prepared to handle it if I ever do learn to transform like you on purpose.
|-
!Marco
|Queen Moon—
|-
!Star
|[kicks Marco under the table]
|-
!Marco
|Ouch! I... have nothing to say.
|-
!
|''Cut to hours later, at evening. Star enters her bedroom with the wrecked Goblin Dog truck sitting on top of her bed.''
|-
!Star
|Food Truck Bed Transform!
|-
!
|''Star restores her bed, with the Goblin Dog logo on the front.''
|-
!Star
|All right, Marco. Let's try this again.
|-
!
|''Marco chains Star to her bed with multiple chains and shackles and locks them with a large key.''
|-
!Marco
|So... this'll keep you from morphing into... Butterfly Star?
|-
!Star
|Yep! Don't worry, Marco, I got this.
|-
!Marco
|But even your mom seemed concerned.
|-
!Star
|My parents cannot know about this! You heard what Dad said! Locked away forever!
|-
!Marco
|I think he was exaggerating a little.
|-
!Star
|Marco. My squire. You are the only person I can trust with this. Promise me you won't doze off again.
|-
!Marco
|Don't worry, not gonna happen. And even if it does, this chain will alert me any time you move, and I'll wake up, too.
|-
!Star
|Thanks, Marco. [sighs] Good night. [goes to sleep]
|-
!
|''Marco sits down on a footstool, and Glossaryck jumps into his lap again.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah! Glossaryck! Oh, no, you don't. You're not making me fall asleep this time! [puts Glossaryck outside Star's room] Out you go. [closes door]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Globgor?
|-
!
|''Cut to hours later, late at night. Marco has once again dozed off.''
|-
!Marco
|[snoring]
|-
!
|''Something glows off-screen. Objects around Star's room start floating, and Marco gets hit in the back by Star's star-shaped purse.''
|-
!Marco
|Oof! [falls over] Huh? [gasps]
|-
!
|''Star, in her butterfly form, floats over her bed and struggles against her chains. A dimensional portal over the bed sucks up everything in the room.''
|-
!Star
|[grunting]
|-
!
|''Some of Star's chains break, and she pulls her bed with her into the portal.
|-
!Marco
|Star!
|-
!
|''The chain attached to Marco's leg starts getting pulled into the portal.''
|-
!Marco
|Oh, no. Aah!
|-
!
|''Marco gets pulled into the portal. He and Star fly into the space-like void between dimensions.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa! [dodging asteroids] Ah! Ahh! [sees vending machine fly by] Huh? [gets hit in the face with a bag of [[Gold'n Crispz]]] What the...?
|-
!
|''Marco flies past [[Ludo]]. Ludo waves to Marco. Marco waves back. Star drags Marco through an asteroid field.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah! Whoa! Whaaa! [grunting] Star! Wake up!
|-
!
|''Marco grabs the chain connected to his leg, pulls himself toward Star, and grabs her ankle.''
|-
!Star
|Marco?
|-
!Marco
|I need you to fly us back to that portal!
|-
!Star
|Portal? Ohhh...
|-
!
|''Star grabs Marco and flies back toward the portal. Her butterfly wings start to fade away, an the horns on her headband shrink to normal size.''
|-
!Star
|Huh? Seriously?
|-
!
|''Star reverts back to normal form, and she and Marco drift out of control.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|[wailing]
|-
!
|''Star and Marco float past the portal.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, no-no-no.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck appears out of the portal with a chain of cloths tied around him.
|-
!Star
|What?
|-
!
|''Star and Marco grab the cloth chain, and they are pulled through the portal.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''They end up back in Star's bedroom. Glossaryck hops over to [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]].''
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|Are you two all right?
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa! I am so glad you're here. Wait a minute. Why are you here?
|-
!Eclipsa
|I'm returning this little guy after he wandered into my tower.
|-
!Marco
|Eclipsa?! [gasps] Isn't she that ancient evil queen everyone's talking about? We don't trust you one bit!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, are you afraid I'll get my evil cooties on you?
|-
!Marco
|[assumes karate pose] Stay back, woman!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[imitates karate pose] What's this? Some sort of sword hand dance? This looks fun.
|-
!Marco
|Don't come any closer!
|-
!Star
|Marco, she's really not dangerous.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Aren't you adorable?
|-
!Marco
|Who are you calling adorable?!
|-
!Star
|Stop! I have had ten times my daily dose of weirdness in the last hour, so let's just call it a night, okay?
|-
!Marco
|What? Y-Y-You can't just—
|-
!Star
|Nope. [pushes Marco out the door] Nope-nope-nope-nope-nope-nope-nope-nope-nope. [closes door, groans]
|-
!
|''Eclipsa starts to leave.''
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa! Wait. Wait-wait-wait. I need to ask you something.
|-
!
|''Cut to Star and Eclipsa having tea.''
|-
!Star
|[sighs] So, that's about it. Every night, I still go all "Rah! Butterfly monster!" [sighs] I just wish I could stop it.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Do you need to stop it?
|-
!Star
|You saw what happened tonight. It was horrible.
|-
!Eclipsa
|What about the other times? Were ''they'' so horrible?
|-
!Star
|Well, no, not exactly. In fact, they were really fun. They were actually the most amazing dreams I've ever had.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I wouldn't run from these dreams.
|-
!
|''A flying teapot refills Eclipsa's teacup.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|I would embrace them. See where they take me.
|-
!Star
|Really? You think I should just let them happen?
|-
!Eclipsa
|It's the only way to learn what you're truly capable of. All knowledge is good knowledge, I always say. Well, I should get back to my tower before the guards realize I'm missing.
|-
!Star
|Oh, yeah. How did you break out of there, anyway? I thought you were under tower arrest.
|-
!Eclipsa
|So long as we're spilling secrets... Oh, Captain! Permission to come aboard?
|-
!
|''The sea captain in the portrait on Star's wall winks. The portrait opens to reveal a secret passageway.''
|-
!Star
|Whaaaaat?! I never knew that was there!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Yes, I used these secret tunnels constantly when I was your age. All knowledge is good knowledge, my dear.
|-
!
|''Cut to the following night. Marco enters Star's bedroom.''
|-
!Marco
|Okay, so the chains were a bust. But how about...? [holds out bottle of magic glue]
|-
!Star
|Actually, Marco, I don't need you to watch me tonight.
|-
!Marco
|Oh! Did you figure out how to stop transforming?
|-
!Star
|No, but I thought maybe I should see what I'm capable of or whatever.
|-
!
|''Star poofs up a new bed.''
|-
!Marco
|Star, you don't know anything about this.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, and I'll ''never'' know anything about it if I keep trying to stop it. I know it's weird, but I really need to see this through, okay?
|-
!Marco
|Okay, I guess. But could you at least take my dimensional scissors with you in case you get trapped?
|-
!Star
|Sorry, Marco, but if I'm gonna do this, I can't do it halfway.
|-
!Marco
|Okay, fine! I tried to help! No one can say I didn't try! Because I tried. So if you die out there, don't go blaming me, all right?
|-
!Star
|[happily] All right!
|-
!Marco
|[angrily] All right! [sighs] Well... good luck out there.
|-
!
|''Marco leaves the room. Star turns off the lights and goes to sleep. Her cheek marks start glowing. When Marco comes back, he sees a dimensional portal in her bed. He sits down on the footstool, and Glossaryck jumps onto his lap.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Globgor...
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, Gloss. I'm not sure she can do this alone, either.
|-
!
|''Episode ends on shot of the dimensional portal in Star's bed.''
