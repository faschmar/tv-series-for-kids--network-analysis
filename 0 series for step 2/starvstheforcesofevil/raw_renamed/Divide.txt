|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay, and how exactly big was this portal?
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|[stammering] It was huge. I mean, massive.
|-
!Star
|[writing] "Ginormous portal..." And you say it was rainbow-colored?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Yes, all kinds of swirling colors. She went to it like a moth to a flame.
|-
!Star
|Ah, right, I know that one.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I'm so sorry. Moon would have stopped her if I hadn't interfered. Now Meteora's heading this way.
|-
!Star
|[clicks pen] Okay, well, that about covers it. Guards!
|-
!Lady Whosits and Kyle
|Hup-hup-hup-hup-hup! [grab Star by the arms]

!Star
|[yelps] Not me. [points at Eclipsa] Her.

|-
!Eclipsa
|Star, what are you going to do? What are you going to do to my daughter?!
|-
!Star
|Come on, [[Marco Diaz|Marco]].

!Kyle
|[muffled through door] Uh, I-I'm in here.
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Hey, you doing okay with this queen thing?
|-
!Star
|Ugh! I'm not queen. I'm ''acting'' queen. My [[Queen Butterfly|mom]]'s still out there!
|-
!Marco
|Right! Right-right-right-right-right. Acting queen! Well, are you doing okay, acting queen?
|-
!Star
|Marco! I'm freakin' out, man!
|-
!Marco
|I know! I'm freakin' out, too! Being a queen's squire, it's like a... a big deal.
|-
!Star
|Mmmm...
|-
!Marco
|Sorry. Acting queen.
|-
!Star
|Everybody's looking at me for decisions, but all I can think about is my mom. [points at portrait of [[Queen Butterfly]]] Ohhh, what would Mama do?
|-
!Marco
|Wha... What are you doing?
|-
!Star
|Waiting... for an answer.

|Queen Star.

|We have a situation that demands your attention. May I present Mr. Bugbert Swampington and his family.

!Marco
|Aah! What happened to 'em?!
|-
!Bugbert Swampington
|Big monster ramp-ragin' through the countryside, gave 'em the eye and made 'em all floaty.

!Marco
|[[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]].
|-
!Star
|Sir, I assure you the Butterflys are on this job, and we will fix this. You have my word.
|-
!Bugbert
|Yeah? All right.
|-
!Manfred
|[blows trumpet]
|-
!Star
|Manfred! Stop with the horn.
|-
!Manfred
|Sorry, my queen. The scouting raven has returned with news of the monster.
|-
!Raven
|[squawking] The monster... It approaches... the castle! Must... fly away! [flies away]

|What do we do, my queen?
|-

|We're gonna figure it out.

|Bless you, Queen! Bless you.

|''Scene cuts to the royal council room. Star bursts in by kicking the door open. The council consists of Sir Dashing of Muscleton, Sir Stabby, [[Hekapoo]], [[Omnitraxus Prime]], [[Rhombulus]], [[Sir Scarsguard]] and his wife, and Lady Whosits.''
|-
!Star
|Okay, everybody, hi. Thanks for coming. Look, my mom is gone. Uh, she's coming back. Workin' on that. In the meantime, we need to come up with— Hey! What are you doing here?
|-
![[Hekapoo]]
|Uh, counseling you?
|-
!Star
|No! No! No-no-no-no-no! I'm sorry, no liars allowed. Leave now! [uses her wand to open the door] Out, out, out, out! Go! Out!

!
|''Hekapoo, Rhombulus, and Omnitraxus leave.''
|-
![[Rhombulus]]
|Big mistake.
|-
!Hekapoo
|You're gonna need us.
|-
![[Omnitraxus Prime]]
|Omnitraxus Prime has spoken!
|-
!Star
|[closes the door] Ugh! Okay, here's where we're at. Meteora is on her way here right now to destroy us all, and so far, nobody has been able to stop her. Pretty serious. So I am opening up the floor for any ideas you've got. [laughs] C'mon, gang, there's no dumb suggestions! Sir Scarsguard! You've led the [[Mewni]] army against legions of marauding monsters for three generations. You even taught me how to wield a sword. In this time of crisis, your expertise would—
|-
![[Sir Scarsguard]]
|[holding hearing aid] What'd she say?
|-
!Lady Scarsguard
|She said that there's a monster that they want you—
|-
!Sir Scarsguard
|What?
|-
!Lady Scarsguard
|—you to go and fight, to be fighting the monster.
|-
!Sir Scarsguard
|I can't hear a word.
|-
!Lady Scarsguard
|[louder] There's a monster—
|-
!Sir Scarsguard
|Not a single word.
|-
!Lady Scarsguard
|—that they would like you—
|-
!Sir Scarsguard
|I must be out of batteries.
|-
!Lady Scarsguard
|You're not even trying. [to Star] You see? He acts like that thing doesn't work.
|-
!Star
|Okay, uh, thank you, Lord and Lady Scarsguard.
|-
!Lady Scarsguard
|Welcome to my life. [whimpers]
|-
!Star
|Okay... Sir Muscleton!
|-
!Sir Dashing of Muscleton
|What's up, baby girl?
|-
!Star
|...What did you... What did you call me?
|-
!Sir Muscleton
|I think I called yooouuuu... baby girl.
|-
!
|''Star blasts Sir Muscleton with her wand.''
|-
!Sir Muscleton
|Aah!
|-
!Star
|Yeah, so Sir Dashing of Muscleton isn't gonna be able to help us. Marco, what do ya got?
|-
!Marco
|What about [[Mina Loveberry]]?
|-
!Star
|Oh, right, Mina! [laughs] Perfect! That nut mix is a one-woman army!
|-
!Lady Whosits
|Way ahead of you. We already sent Mina out to do just that.
|-
!Star
|[laughs] Great!
|-
!Lady Whosits
|And she lost.

!

!Chef
|Queen Star?
|-
!Star
|''Acting'' queen!
|-
!Chef
|We just need to know what the royal kitchen should make for dinner.
|-
!Star
|Just choose anything!
|-
!Chef
|Queen Moon always decided on the menu, not us.
|-
!Star
|Okay. Well, today's the day you start. Surprise me.
|-
!Chef
|Of course. What would you like us to surprise you with?
|-
!
|''Star leaves the room and walks down the corridor, frustrated. [[King Butterfly]] runs up to her.''
|-
![[King Butterfly|King River]]
|Star! Wait!
|-
!Star
|What is it, Dad?!
|-
!River
|I want to help you plan.
|-
!Star
|Oh, yes! Oh, thank you, Papa. How do we stop Meteora?
|-
!River
|No, I meant the dinner menu. I've got some ideas.
|-
!Star
|Ugh. Not helping, Dad.
|-
!River
|I'm sorry, Star, but you're queen now. I've seen how strong you've grown. You'll figure it out. And whatever you decide, I'll back you! Think about a corn medley. Cornbread, cornmeal. That's an entire meal of corn.
|-
!Star
|[sighs] Thanks, Dad. I do love corn.

|[picks up Glossaryck] Glossaryck, what do I do?

!Glossaryck
|Globgor!

!Star
|[groans into her pillow]
|-
!Marco
|[enters room] Uh, buddy? The chefs are working on dinner, but they wanted me to ask you about dessert.
|-
!Star
|Argh! How am I supposed to delegate anything to these cornheads?! Can't anybody here actually think for themselves without my mom around?!
|-
!
|''[[Sir Lavabo]] enters with a rack of Star's clothes.''
|-
![[Sir Lavabo]]
|Good day, acting Queen Butterfly!
|-
!Star
|Finally, somebody gets it right.
|-
!Sir Lavabo
|I have your laundry, freshly pressed.
|-
!Star
|Thank you. Just leave it on the thing.
|-
!Sir Lavabo
|I've sorted it all from your favorite to least favorite color and removed a couple stains I found. I also re-dyed a few items to better compliment your skin tone.
|-
!Star
|Oh. Thank you. That's actually really helpful.
|-
!Sir Lavabo
|I also ironed your socks and re-hemmed your favorite dinosaur skirt.
|-
!Star
|Wow, that's amazing.
|-
!Sir Lavabo
|It seemed better to head off the problem before it got worse.
|-
!Star
|Why didn't I see it before?! Lavabo, it's you!
|-
!Sir Lavabo
|Me?
|-
!Marco
|Him?!
|-
!Star
|You! [hugs Lavabo] Steadfast Lavabo, dependable Lavabo! Sir Lavabo, I have a job for you.
|-
!Marco
|What?!
|-
!Sir Lavabo
|[holds Star's hand and kneels] My queen, it would be an honor to serve you in any way—
|-
!Marco
|No, no. No, no, no. [pushes Lavabo out of the room] Nuh-uh. No way. Can you, um... Can you please excuse us for just a...? [slams door] What are you thinking?! You can't send him!
|-
!Star
|Do you have a better plan, squire? Because I have been waiting to hear one all day!
|-
!Marco
|...Me. Send me.
|-
!Star
|You? Marco, no offense, but it's gonna take more than a red belt to defeat Meteora.
|-
!Marco
|[ties his hoodie around his head] You forget I have 16 years of experience fighting thousands of Hekapoos. [pounds wall, catches battle axe and spiked flail] Go ahead! Hit me with your best spell!
|-
!Star
|Marco, I'm not gonna fight you.
|-
!Marco
|Weeeeaaaak!
|-
!Star
|Ugh. Come on, Marco, I really don't have time for this nonsense— Strawberry Shake Quake!
|-
!
|''Star fires strawberries at Marco. He uses the axe to slice them all in half, then catches half a strawberry in his hand.''

!Star
|Narwhal Blast!
|-
!
|''Star launches narwhals at Marco, and he punches them all away. One flies over Star's head and into the wall.''

|Okay. Not bad, Diaz.
|-
!Marco
|[laughs] Told you!
|-
!
|''Star lifts up the front of Marco's shirt to look at his bare chest.''
|-
!Marco
|No, Star, my abs are not back.
|-
!Star
|Just checking. Look, just because you can take on my spells doesn't mean you can take on Meteora. I don't know if anyone can.
|-
!Marco
|Your mom can. You heard what Eclipsa said. If she hadn't interfered, your mom would have beaten Meteora. I don't have to stop her. I just have to buy you time to find your mom and bring her back.
|-
!Star
|Okay. We gotta divide and conquer. You keep Meteora from reaching the castle while I go find my mom.
|-
!Marco
|How are you gonna do that?
|-
!Star
|My mom is stuck in the [[Realm of Magic|magic dimension]]. I gotta go there to find her.
|-
!Marco
|But that's where you lost your memory. That's really dangerous.
|-
!Star
|I know, but... I don't have a choice. Okay. As acting queen, I order you, my squire Marco Diaz, to do whatever it takes to stop Meteora from reaching Butterfly Castle.
|-
!Marco
|I accept my orders.
|-
!Star
|[blushes, turns away] Okay, well, then you get started on that order right away.
|-
!Marco
|Hey, Star. You know, you don't have to pretend to be strong around me. I'm your best friend.
|-
!Star
|Mmmm! Ugh! I need a hug! [whimpers]
|-
!
|''Star and Marco hug.''
|-
!Star
|I'm really scared.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah... Me, too.
|-
!Chef
|[bursts in] Hello, Queen Butterfly! Dinner is served!
|-
!
|''Still hugging, Star and Marco blush. They pull out of the hug and awkwardly shake hands.''
|-
!Star
|Great talking!
|-
!Marco
|Yes, thank you, friend!
|-
!Star
|Just a talk, bro!
|-
!Chef
|Uhhh... Anyway, we did what you said. We got creative!
|-
!
|''The chef reveals a tray of corn gelatin.''
|-
!Star
|Good first try.
|-
!Sir Lavabo
|Can I go now?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to black, then cuts to the Realm of Magic. Star comes through the portal in her [[Mewberty (phase)|mewberty]] form, then changes back to her normal form. A small unicorn washes up next to her on a wave of gold water.''
|-
!Unicorn
|Oh, hey! It's you! You wanna paddle around with me?
|-
!Star
|Oh, no! No-no-no-no-no way, buster! If I have fun with you, I'll forget who I am and be stuck here forever.
|-
!Unicorn
|Yeah! Doesn't that sound great?!
|-
!Star
|Nice try, but this time I came prepared!
|-
!
|''Star takes out her compact mirror phone.''

|Okay, have fun! I'll see ya soon!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to a forest outside the Butterfly Groundlands. Marco marches back and forth.''
|-
!Marco
|I've called you all here because you're the most cunning, the most agile, the most experienced, hardest-hitting wahoos I know.
|-
!
|''[[Kelly]], [[Jorby]], [[Talon Raventalon]], Talon's dragoncycle, Hekapoo, and [[Nachos]] all stand in a row.''
|-
!Marco
|(''o.s.'') Each of you were hand-picked for your specific set of skills. Hekapoo's basically a one-woman army, and she's also on fire.
|-
!
|''Hekapoo creates a clone of herself.''
|-
!Marco
|(''o.s.'') Talon is... is really big, and I think Hekapoo has a crush on him, but it's probably just because of his body.
|-
![[Talon Raventalon]]
|Wait, what?
|-
!Hekapoo and clone
|[shrugs]
|-
!Marco
|(''o.s.'') And then Jorby and Kelly...
|-
!
|''Kelly sharpens one of her swords on Jorby's teeth.''
|-
!Marco
|They're, um... well... Kelly's got a lot of swords! Anyway, I feel proud to call you my "Marc-nificent Seven".
|-
![[Jorby]]
|[speaking gibberish]
|-
![[Kelly]]
|Oh, yeah, good point. You're right, Jorby. Yeah, Jorby says, uh, your math is off. Yeah, there's only, uh... There's only four of us here plus you. That's five. Two short of a seven.
|-
!
|''[[Pony Head]] appears with an axe blade mounted on her horn.''
|-
![[Pony Head]]
|He forgot about me!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Uh...
|-
!Talon
|Who's that?
|-
!Marco
|No, I-I didn't forget about you. I... You're late. And what is that thing on your head?
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, that's just my battle axe. I'm basically like a cyborg now. I could change into anything I want. Mascara brush. Little tiny Pony Head. Chainsaw!
|-
!Marco
|Okay, I get it, Pony Head. Talon! What are you doing?
|-
!Talon
|[holding box of sunglasses] What am I doin'? I'm handing out shades for our group victory photo.
|-
!Marco
|We're not doing a group photo.
|-
!Talon
|Dude, every group I've ever run with takes a cool sunglasses group shot.
|-
!
|''Talon takes out a set of photos with Talon posing with Little League baseball teams, all wearing sunglasses.''
|-
!Marco
|Are... Are those... Little League teams?
|-
!Talon
|Little?! There's nothin' little about them! You don't know what it's like to be alone on the field, your friends covered in boo-boos and ouchies.
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|(''o.s.'') Hey!
|-
!
|''[[Tom Lucitor|Tom]] appears out of a hole in the ground, his eyes glowing and flames from his palms propelling him upward.''
|-
!Tom
|Listen to your commander.
|-
!Marco
|Ha! See? I told you there were seven of us. Boom. Eat that, Kelly.
|-
!Pony Head
|Earth Turd! Are you gonna tell us the plan or what?
|-
!Marco
|Oh, yes. The plan is simple. We're gonna build... the Doom Nut!
|-
!
|''Tom makes a fire behind Marco's head to make him look more dramatic. Marco takes out a sword and draws a diagram in the dirt.''
|-
!Marco
|Jorby and Kelly, you're gonna make a huge dugout circle. Talon and Pony will fill it with wood. When Meteora steps inside, Tom's gonna set the wood on fire, trapping her in a flaming prison.
|-
!Pony Head
|Ohhhh! "Doom Nut"! Because it looks like a doughnut! Earth Turd, that is very clever. I am into this plan.
|-
!Marco
|I'll open up the floor to questions if there's anything you'd like to ask me about the plan or this thing in my hand that I'm holding. 
|-
!Tom
|Oh. Well, I'll just take the bait here. Where did you get that sword, Marco?
|-
!Marco
|Oh! This old thing? Funny you should ask. This is "El Choppo". I got this sword from the mists of the Never Zone when I was in my early 30s, and it's still even got some dried blood on it. Any other questions? Yes, Kelly?
|-
!Kelly
|Wait, how are we going to convince her to step into what is an obvious trap?
|-
!Pony Head
|You know, I'm no longer into this plan.
|-
!Marco
|Simple, Kelly. We use the best bait. Me. [points El Choppo at Tom]
|-
!Tom
|Aah! Dude.

!Marco
|Sorry.

|[with mouth full] Oh, my bad. [spits water back into canteen] Well, here you go.
|-
!Marco
|Ugh... [dumps water out of canteen]
|-
!Tom
|Marco, you know, I-I kind of treated you bad sometimes. Like that ping-pong game, or the... the [[Blood Moon Ball (event)|Blood Moon Ball]], those [[Mackie Hand]] tickets, [[Naysaya (character)|Naysaya]]...

|I-I get it, Tom.
|-

|The [[Monster Arm (character)|monster arm]].

!Star
|Marshmallow? [mesmerized] Find marshmallow!

!Black Unicorn

|It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt ya.

|''Back on Mewni, Marco stands alone in a small field next to a stream of water.''
|-
!Marco
|[acting] Woe is me! A rebel princess in distress named Turdina! Nachos, my precious steed, what will I do?
|-
!
|''Something approaches with loud footsteps, and a flock of crows flies out of the trees.
|-
!Marco
|All right, Nachos, stick to the plan.
|-
!
|''The monster from "[[Marco and the King]]" emerges from the trees.''
|-
!Monster
|Are you okay?
|-
!Marco
|Uh, sorry. Looking for a different monster.
|-
!Monster
|I just thought you needed help.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah... Actually, hey, we could really use your help!
|-
!Monster
|Huh. Well, now it just kind of feels weird. I don't know. Good luck finding your monst—
|-
!
|''Something suddenly zaps the monster and sucks out his soul. He floats up into the air, revealing Meteora, who has grown to giant monster size.''
|-
![[Meteora Butterfly]]
|[singsong] I'm right here!
|-
!Marco
|Huh?!
|-
!
|''Marco ducks under Meteora's soul ray and gets on Nachos. Meteora approaches, and Marco has trouble starting Nachos' engine.
|-
!Marco
|Really?!
|-
!
|''With one last push on the pedal, Marco starts Nachos' engine and flies away from Meteora. Meteora's soul ray hits Nachos mid-flight, and she sucks out Nachos' soul. Marco dangles helplessly from Nachos' handlebars.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa-ho! [falls, screams]
|-
!
|''As Marco falls out of the sky, Kelly and Jorby catch him and run from Meteora. Meteora chases after them and blasts Jorby with her soul ray. Marco and Kelly fall to the ground, and Jorby's body floats off into the sky.''

!Kelly
|Jorby!
|-
!
|''Meteora emerges from the trees.''

|-
!Marco
|Now, Tom!
|-
!
|''Tom sets the wood in the dug trench on fire. Marco and Kelly run out of the ring of fire before it closes.''
|-
!Meteora
|Huh? Aah!
|-
!Tom
|Hey, "Mete-normous"! Looks like you're trapped!
|-
!
|''Meteora is surrounded by a ring of fire.''
|-
!Marco
|I think... I think we did it!
|-
!Meteora
|Graaah!
|-
!
|''Meteora uses her tail to blow the flames away. She looks at Marco, Kelly, and Pony Head, and they slowly back away.''
|-
!Kelly
|Hey, what's the plan now?
|-
!Marco
|...Run.
|-
!
|''Back in the Realm of Magic, Star watches the jellyfish fly through the sky while Moon splashes her feet in the water.''
|-
!Star
|Whatcha doin' over there?
|-
!Moon
|I don't know. Feels good though.
|-
!Star
|I want to feel good, too. Let me try.
|-
!
|''Star takes off one of her boots, and a small slip of paper falls out.''
|-
!Star
|What the...?
|-
!
|''Star reads the slip of paper. It reads "YOU ARE STAR BUTTERFLY!"''

!Star
|What are these symbols?
|-
!Phone

|-
!
|''Multiple compact phones fall out of Star's boot.''
|-
!Star (Recordings)
|[overlapping] ''You are Star Butterfly. You must find your mom and bring her home. You are Star Butterfly. You must find your mom and bring her home.''
|-
!Star
|I'm... Star... Butterfly! Oh, no! It's happening again! Mom! Mom, Mom, get up!
|-

|-
!Moon
|Ooh! What is that? It's amazing!
|-
!Star
|[stares at portal, mesmerized] Whoa... It is amazing!
|-
!
|''Back on Mewni, Meteora searches for Marco under a bunch of rocks.''
|-
!Meteora
|Turdina! I know we've had our issues, but it's nothing we can't talk about!
|-
!Marco
|[panting, runs behind another rock] Come on, Star! Hurry up!
|-
!
|''Meteora picks up the rock Marco is hiding behind and crushes it in her hand. She then tries to stomp on him with her foot.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah!
|-
!
|''Hekapoo's clones stop Meteora's foot.''
|-
!Hekapoo Clone
|[straining] Marco! Dude, get up!
|-
!Hekapoo Clones
|[groaning]
|-
!
|''Meteora stomps the Hekapoo clones flat while Marco runs away. He jumps behind a log and joins Tom and the real Hekapoo.''
|-
!Tom
|I don't know how much more we can take of this.
|-
!Meteora
|(''o.s.'') Hey!
|-
!
|''Meteora shields herself from one of Kelly's swords.''
|-
!Meteora
|You could've put out someone's eye!
|-
!
|''Kelly hurls her swords at Meteora. Meteora blocks them with her arm and blasts her soul rays at Kelly, who dodges them. Talon and Pony Head ride Talon's dragoncycle toward Meteora.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Talon, launch me!
|-
!Talon
|You got it!
|-
!
|''Talon hurls Pony Head at Meteora. She lightly hits Meteora's shoulder and falls to the ground.''
|-
!Pony Head
|I don't hear nothin'. She's dead, right? I won?
|-
!
|''Meteora uses her soul ray on Pony Head and sucks out her soul. Marco, Tom, and Hekapoo look horrified.''
|-
!Marco
|Where's Star?
|-
!
|''Back in the Realm of Magic, Star and Moon run past the open portal.''
|-
