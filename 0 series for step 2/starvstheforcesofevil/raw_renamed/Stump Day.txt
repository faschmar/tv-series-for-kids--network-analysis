!Merchant
| Stumps here. Get your fresh stumps here.
|-
!Kid
| Daddy, can we go sing some Stump carols?
|-
!Father
| Oh not until we get you some cocoa first!

|-
![[King Butterfly]]
| Good evening, everyone. Please gather round.
|-
!Star
| [gasps excitedly, runs over and sits next to [[Marco Diaz]], knocking him over]
|-
!King Butterfly
| Today we pay thanks to the roots of our kingdom! [gestures to a stump] To the Stump!
|-
!Mewman
| To the Stump!
|-
!All
| To the Stump!
|-
!Star
| Yes! To the Stump! Whoo hoo!
|-
!Baby
| Tell us the story of Stump Day, Uncle River.
|-
!King Butterfly
| Ha ha ha ha! You don't tell me what to do. Now, let me tell you the story of the first Stump Day. Centuries ago, a small band of explorers crashed their ships on Mewni. After weeks of traveling, they began to get on each other's nerves.
|-
!Star
| Aah! Oh, no.
|-
!King Butterfly
| They planned to go their separate ways, but suddenly, a blizzard struck. Blizzard! And the crew was forced to survive by huddling together around a giant tree stump to keep warm and share supplies. They forged a lasting bond that day, and decided not to split up after all. To commemorate the occasion, they carved their initials on the back of the stump, and the kingdom of Mewni was born! And that is why, each year, we come together and honor the Stump through our friendships for a full 24 hours. [sinister] Or else.
|-
!Marco
| Or else?
|-
!Star
| Shhhhhhhh!
|-
!King Butterfly
| Thank you, everyone, for making this a Stump Day to remember!
|-
!All
| [applause]
|-
!Baby
| Do you think the Stump will visit me tonight?
|-
!Girl
| Come on. Only babies believe in the Stump.
|-
!Star
| Oh, don't listen to her. I know the Stump is real, and if you've been good, the Stump will never visit. [runs over to her parents, hugs] Happy Stump Day, Mom and Dad. [runs over to Marco, hugs] Happy Stump Day, Marco. Happy Stump Day, everyone.
|-
!Marco
| You're really into this, huh?
|-
!Star
| Oh, you have no idea. This is my favorite holiday. It is so special.
|-
!Marco
| [laughs] More special than you think.
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps to later that night. Star is singing while brushing her teeth''
|-
!Star
| ♪ All hail the Stump, for it is great and kind ♪<br />♪ Don't anger the Stump, or it will be unkind ♪<br />♪ The Stump is our savior, we praise it on this day ♪<br />♪ Keep the Stump in your heart, and let it lead the way ♪ [spits, gets in bed] Ah! The perfect Stump Day.
|-
!
| ''There's a knock on her door. It creaks open.''
|-
!Star
| The Stump! [pulls up covers]
|-
!Marco
| Star? Are you decent?
|-
!Star
| [yelling] Marco! Ugh! Quit creeping around, you creep. [throws pillow at him] It's Stump Day.
|-
!Marco
| Sorry, sorry. Uh, can you come downstairs for a second? One of the windows is stuck, and I need your magic to fix it.
|-
!Star
| Sure. I can... I can do that. It is Stump Day, after all.
|-
!Marco
| Stump-tacular.
|-
!Star
| A good try, Marco.
|-
!
| ''Scene changes to another room.''
|-
!Marco
| It's right over here.
|-
!Star
| Uh, Marco, I can't see anything.
|-
!
| ''The lights flip on. [[Tom Lucitor]], [[Janna Ordonia]], [[Kelly]], and [[StarFan13]] are gathered in a room filled with decorations. Above, there's a banner reading "Happy Quinceañera Star", and there's a large cake on the table.''
|-
!All
| Surprise!
|-
!Starfan13
| [snaps a photo of Star's face, laughs]
|-
!
| ''The photo drops to the floor. In it, Star looks very distraught.''
|-
!Marco
| Your birthday always falls on Stump Day, so we decided... [yelling] surprise quinceañera! Hit it!
|-
!
| ''A mariachi band starts playing.''
|-
!Band
| ♪ Cumpleaños feliz. Cumpleaños feliz ♪
|-
!Star
| Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no, oh, no! [screams, runs over to the band, grabs the guitar, smashes it]
|-
!Marco
| Star, wha-what's wrong?
|-
!Star
| We never celebrate my birthday on my actual birthday, Marco, because it's Stump Day.
|-
!Band Member
| ¿Lo que es un día de tocón?
|-
!Star
| ¡Es un día muy importante!
|-
!Marco
| But it's your birthday, too. Isn't that pretty important?
|-
!Star
| Not as important as the Stump. Today is the Stump's day. [pops balloon]
|-
!Kelly
| Oh, come on, Star. Don't tell me you still believe in the Stump.
|-
![[Pony Head]]
| Yeah, that's a baby story. Like, for babies.
|-
!Tom
| Awe, I think it's cute. [holds Star]
|-
!Star
| Get off me, non-believer. [kneeling] O, great Stump, I beg your forgiveness, for they [points to Earthlings] do not know the ways of the Stump, and they [points to others] are but foolish teenagers.
|-
!Marco
| Wait, so the Stump is real?
|-
!Kelly, Tom, and Ponyhead
| No!
|-
!Kelly
| It's just a manipulative fairy tale...
|-
!Tom
| ...that parents tell their kids...
|-
!Pony Head
| ...so that they're less annoying during the holidays.
|-
!Star
| He he. Okay, everyone, thank you so much for this magnificent party. I am overwhelmed with joy. Really. But unfortunately, I cannot celebrate my birthday today. As the song goes, ♪ We honor the Stump each year ♪ [kicks over tower of presents]♪ To this we have sworn ♪ [smashes plate of cookies] ♪ If we anger the Stump, We'll wish we were never born ♪ [takes Sombrero off Stump, screams and chases the band away]
|-
!Janna
| [bumping Tom] That's my girl.
|-
!Star
| [struggling with the band] Come on, guys, help me honor the Stump.
|-
!Marco
| Um, Star.
|-
!Star
| [pops balloons frantically]
|-
!Marco
| What gives? It took me a long time to set up these decorations and bake your favorite flavor of cake, rainbow. I even imported a mariachi band all the way from Earth just so you could have a birthday.
|-
!
| ''The lead band member pulls out another guitar, and they start to sing.''

!Band
| ♪ Cumpleaños feliz ♪
|-
!Marco
| Guys, not now.
|-
!Band
| [stops]
|-
!Marco
| Look, Star, I think I know what this is really about. You're afraid of getting older. It's cool. We've all been there.
|-
!Star
| What? No, this isn't like that at all.
|-
!Pony Head
| Yeah, Marco, you know what? Maybe this is really about you, and how you have to control every situation like a maniac. Okay? I mean, you didn't even ask Star if she wanted a birthday party. [scoffs] That's rude.
|-
!Marco
| Because that would've ruined the surprise. Duh!
|-
!Tom
| I told you this was a bad idea, dude, but you didn't wanna listen.
|-
!Marco
| Well, at least I wanted to throw Star a party. You didn't plan anything, and you're supposed to be her boyfriend.
|-
!Kelly and Janna
| Whoa!
|-
!Pony Head
| Ohhhh! Oh!
|-
!Tom
| What?
|-
!Kelly
| [whispering] Marco, take it back.
|-
!Marco
| You heard me, Lucitor.
|-
!Tom
| Uh, I didn't plan anything, because unlike you, I actually thought about what Star would want.
|-
!Marco
| Did you? Because this morning, it kinda seemed like you forgot.
|-
!Tom
| Oh ho ho. That's it. [bursts into flame] I'm gonna pound you into next Stump Day.
|-
!
| ''He hurls a fireball at Marco, but he misses and almost hits the band.''
|-
!Band Leader
| ¡Es el diablo!
|-
!
| ''Tom dives at Marco, and the two start wrestling.''
|-
!Star
| Boys, stop it.
|-
!Tom
| [putting Marco in a chokehold] Say I'm a good boyfriend.
|-
!Marco
| Never.
|-
!Pony Head
| Whoa! Happy birthday, Star. It's the ultimate gift. Two boys are fighting over you.
|-
!Star
| Ugh!
|-
!Janna
| All right, dinner and a show.
|-
!Kelly
| How can you say that? Marco almost got burnt to a crisp.
|-
!Janna
| Geez, Kelly, chill out. Are you just mad because Marco's fighting Tom over Star instead of you?
|-
!Kelly
| What? Why would you say that?
|-
!Tad
| Yeah, Kelly, why would you say that?
|-
!Kelly
| Tad! Ugh! You need to move out.
|-
!Star
| Guys, stop it. Tom, I really don't care if you forgot it was my birthday.
|-
!Tom
| I didn't forget.
|-
!Marco
| Yes, he did.
|-
!Star
| It doesn't matter, stop fighting!
|-
!Starfan13
| I'm mad because Star is mad.
|-
!Pony Head
| No one is paying attention to me. Also, this party has no hotties.
|-
!Band Leader
| [gasps]
|-
!
| ''Everyone in the room continues to shout over each other.''
|-
!Star
| No! See what I mean? We've angered the Stump, and now it's tearing us apart. [runs over and opens window]
|-
!Pony Head
| Girl, what is wrong with you? Have you gone insane? It's freezing out there.
|-
!Star
| That's right, Pony. Nice and freezing. Just like the settlers felt on their first winter. [grabbing Kelly] Let the cold settle deep into your bones. We believe!
|-
!Kelly
| No, we don't.
|-
!Star
| Ugh! Yes, we do. Tell the Stump you believe, Marco. Tell it!
|-
!Marco
| I believe... we're all gonna get hypothermia. [closes window] Look, isn't someone gonna do something here?
|-
!Janna
| I'm on it. [puts stump in fire place]
|-
!Star
| Janna, no!
|-
!Janna
| Ah, that's nice.
|-
!
| ''Everyone but Star gathers around the fireplace.''
|-
!Janna
|  Get away from my stump.
|-
!Star
| Oh, no!
|-
!
| ''Thunder crashes outside, revealing a large stump-like shadow.''
|-
!Star
| It's here.
|-
!
| ''Tree roots start creeping in through the door. They start grabbing ahold of Janna.''
|-
!Janna
| Marco, if you wanna give me a back rub, just ask.
|-
!
| ''Marco's staring at Janna in horror. The stump pulls Janna into darkness.''
|-
!Janna
| [screams]
|-
!
| ''The stump rises in through the floor. Its carved initials ooze with orange yellow fluid.''
|-
!Tom
| It's real.
|-
!Tom, Kelly, and Ponyhead
| [pull out stumps figures, get on knees] We believe. We believe!
|-
!
| ''The Stump swipes their smaller stumps away from them.''
|-
!Janna
| It's too late for that.
|-
!
| ''The Stump swings another branch/vine at the three. [[Queen Butterfly|Queen Moon]] and King River come bursting in.''
|-
!King Butterfly
| Kids, what is all this ratchet?
|-
!
| ''They continue to scream as the Stump grabs Tom, Kelly, and Pony Head.''
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| Oh, no.
|-
!King Butterfly
| The Stump is real.
|-
!Star
| Wait. You didn't believe in the Stump?
|-
!King Butterfly
| Honey, it's a stump!
|-
!
| ''The stump grabs all the Butterflys and Marco.''
|-
!Marco
| I should've believed you, Star.
|-
!Kelly
| I should've respected the Stump.
|-
!Tom
| I'm sorry for being a bad boyfriend.
|-
!Pony Head
| And I'm truly sorry that I was so hard on Earth Turd, except not really, 'cause he's improved as a person with my thoughtful criticism.
|-
!Janna
| At least we all get to die together. That's kinda cool.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| I'm sorry for blaming you, Star. I love you.
|-
!Star
| I love you, too, Mom. I love you, Dad. I love all of you.
|-
!
| ''Star grabs Marco's hand. Marco grabs Tom's. Tom extends his foot to Janna. They close their eyes. When they open them, everyone is gathered around on a circle holding limbs.''
|-
!Marco
| We're... okay. We did it. The Stump spared us 'cause we all came together.
|-
!Star
| No Marco, it left 'cause it's midnight, and Stump Day is over. It was definitely gonna kill us.
|-
!Marco
| Oh.
|-
!Star
| Thank you, great Stump, wherever you are.
|-
!Marco
| Um, why are you thanking it? You just said it wanted to kill us.
|-
!Star
| Oh, I know. But it also reminded us just how much we mean to each other, even in the face of certain death.
|-
!King Butterfly
| In a way, this has been the best Stump Day of all, though it will be very expensive to repair the damage to the castle.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
| And we'll have to have an extra big celebration next year, just to make sure things are cool between us and the Stump.
|-
!King and Queen
| [laugh nervously]
|-
!Star
| Hey, Marco. I just wanted to say thank you for planning this party for me. It was really sweet, even if the timing wasn't that great.
|-
!Marco
| No problem. You know, with all the infinite dimensions that exist, it's still your birthday somewhere, right? [holds up plate of cake]
|-
!Star
| [takes the plate]
|-
!Marco
| [to band] Hey, guys, it's safe to come out now.
|-
!Band
| [gathers to their feet]
|-
!Marco
| You cool with this?
|-
!Star
| Mm-hmm.
|-
!Marco
| All right guys! ¡A uno, dos, tres!
|-
!
|''The band begins playing music as all the teenagers begin to dance to the music.''
