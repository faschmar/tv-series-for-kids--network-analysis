|''Episode begins at the Lucitor family lake house in the [[Underworld]]. [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]] surfs on a surfboard in the lava ocean. As he surfs, his mother [[Wrathmelior Lucitor|Wrathmelior]] takes photos of him with a camera. The camera dispenses a photo, and Wrathmelior waves it in her hand.''
|-
!Wrathmelior Lucitor
|[trills tongue, shows photo to Dave]
|-
!Dave Lucitor
|That's my boy!
|-
!Exasperella
|That's my nephew!
|-
!Gloominus
|I'm not related to him!
|-
!
|''[[Star Butterfly|Star]] appears in the surf next to Tom, wearing a lava-protection suit and surfing on top of [[Cloudy]] on top of a surfboard.''
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|Excuse me, miss. Couldn't help but notice that that lava suit really "suits" you.
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Well, you don't look so bad yourself, stranger. Well, maybe a little bit bad.
|-
!Tom
|Roar!
|-
!Star
|Last one ashore is a rotten gargoyle egg!
|-
!Tom
|Oh, no, ya don't!
|-
!Star
|[removes helmet] Oh, thanks, Tom. That was so much fun! But I gotta boogie.
|-
!Tom
|Aw, you leaving already? The party's just getting started! [Star tosses her lava suit on his head]
|-
!Star
|Thank you so much for the wonderful day, everyone. Lord and Lady Lucitor, it was a pleasure to see you again.
|-
!Dave
|Yeah, well, some of us are pretty hard to miss.
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[chuckles]
|-
!Star
|And Gloominus, Exasperella, wonderful meeting you both.
|-
!Exasperella
|Well, it was a pleasure, dearie.
|-
!Gloominus
|You know, I was a mean tap dancer 20 years ago.
|-
!
|''There is an awkward pause, and Exasperella stares at Gloominus.''
|-
!Tom
|Wait, Star. So, where are you going?
|-
!Star
|I gotta help [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] make dinner for his family.
|-
!Tom
|Ooooor... you could stay.
|-
!Star
|I'm sorry, Tom, but I promised Marco I'd be there. You understand.
|-
!
|''The sky suddenly gets dark, and thunder crashes as storm clouds roll in over the beach.''
|-
!Dave
|Uh-oh, one of our nasty storms is rolling in. It looks like it might not be safe to travel, Star.
|-
!Tom
|Guess you'll just have to stay here with us 'til it blows over.
|-
!Star
|What? No. I'm not gonna let a little drizzle get in my way. See ya later, handsome!
|-
!
|''Star starts to float away on Cloudy, but he gets struck by lightning and goes flying uncontrollably, and Star falls.''
|-
![[Cloudy]]
|[shrieks]
|-
!Star
|[screaming]
|-
!Tom
|[catches Star] Oof! You okay?
|-
!Star
|I'm okay, I'm okay. Maybe I should—
|-
!Cloudy
|[flies past background screaming]
|-
!Star
|Maybe I should—
|-
!Cloudy
|[flies past background again screaming]
|-
!Star
|Maybe I should—
|-
!Cloudy
|[flies past background yet again screaming]
|-
!Tom
|Maybe you should come inside!
|-
!
|''Cut to lake house interior; Star and the Lucitors sit around the den as fireballs rain from the sky outside.''
|-
!Tom
|You okay, Star? That was a close call.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, I'm fine, but my dinner with Marco... How long is this gonna last?
|-
!
|''Thunder crashes outside. Star startled and holds onto Tom's arm.''
|-
!Star
|[blushes, chuckles nervously] Hi.
|-
!Dave
|Yeah, this one looks pretty bad. We might be stuck here for a while.
|-
!Everyone
|[groans]
|-
!Tom
|No way! I'm gonna miss out on all those gnarly pounders! Why did I even bring my surfboard?
|-
!Exasperella
|Well, how do you think I feel? Cooped up with my weird boyfriend and my gigantic little sister?
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[growling lowly]
|-
!Gloominus
|I like pickles okay, but I can't stand cucumbers.
|-
!Exasperella
|[sarcastic] Well, thank you, Mr. Personality.
|-
!Star
|Well, it has been forever since I got to hang with the Lucitor family. [laughs] Family bonding!
|-
!
|''Cut to Star and Lucitors playing Drabble, which is very similar to Scrabble. Two crossed words on the game board spell out "DEPTHS" and "SULPHUR".''
|-
!Exasperella
|...H-U-R, "Sulphur". That's 30 points.
|-
!Star
|Oh, nice one, Exasperella!
|-
!
|''The painting behind Star and Tom screeches.''
|-
!Star
|What the heck was that?!
|-
!Tom
|Oh, that's just a painting of my great grandfather Relicor. He was quite the lady killer. [chuckles] Uh...
|-
!Star
|So, what's with all the shrieky business?
|-
!Tom
|Oh, he just wants to join us for Drabble. It's his favorite game.
|-
!
|''The painting opens up on hinges, and the real Relicor Lucitor is seen behind it.''
|-
!Relicor Lucitor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|Watch out. He cheats.
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[trills, leaves the room]
|-
!Dave
|Oh, good idea, Honeybunch.
|-
!Star
|What did she say?
|-
!Dave
|Oh, she said that she wanted to mix up some refreshing demonade.
|-
!Exasperella
|Oh, none for me, thanks. I never touch the stuff. [scoops up some of Gloominus' slime and sips it]
|-
!Gloominus
|You know, the thing about demonade is that—
|-
!Star
|Well, I'll go give Wrathmelior a hand. It's been a while since we had any one-on-one time. [leaves the room]
|-
!Relicor
|[flutters to couch, shrieks]
|-
!
|''In the kitchen, Wrathmelior cuts up demonfruit with a knife.''
|-
!Star
|Hey, Wrath! I thought you could use some help. I figured it's been a while since we got to hang. You know, get in some female bonding. So, put me to work. What can I do?
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[ignores Star, continues cutting]
|-
!Star
|[to demon blender] She always like this when she's cooking?
|-
!
|''Wrathmelior removes the demon blender's head.
|-
!Star
|[shrieks]
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[trills, points at demonfruit, then points at blender]
|-
!Star
|Ohhhh-ho-ho-ho-ho! Demonfruit goes in the demon blender. A-doy! Got it. [scoops demonfruit into blender] So, this is some crazy weather we're having, isn't it? On [[Earth]], Marco says it rains cats and dogs, but I've never actually seen any, so... [laughs]
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[huffs]
|-
!Star
|[puts top on overstuffed blender] What's new with you? Bet you've been pretty busy.
|-
!Demon Blender
|Uh, y-you... you kind of overfilled!
|-
!Star
|I know I have.
|-
!
|''The overstuffed demon blender explodes...''
|-
!Star
|[shrieks] Oh!
|-
!
|''and burning demonfruit flies all over the kitchen and comes to life.''
|-
!Demonfruit
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''They run around the kitchen, knocking stuff over and causing general mayhem. One of them singes Star's backside.''
|-
!Star
|Aah! All right, Wrathmelior! You get the blender – I'll take care of these little creeps!
|-
!Demonfruit
|[yelling]
|-
!Star
|Get back here, you little...!
|-
!
|''One demonfruit shakes his butt; Star steps on him. Another demonfruit climbs up the walls; Star smashes it with a frying pan. Three demonfruit dance on the table; Star squishes them with a rolling pin. Three more demonfruit lurk by the kitchen window; Star gets rid of them with karate kicks and punches.''
|-
!Star
|Now come on out!
|-
!
|''Four demonfruit pounce on Star and tackle her to the floor.''
|-
!Star
|[screams] Wrathmelior, I need you!
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[sighs]
|-
!
|''Wrathmelior flicks the rest of the demonfruit away with one finger. They burst into flames on the wall.
|-
!Star
|Wow, we make a pretty good team, don't we? [extends high-five] High five, girlfriend!
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[ignores Star, smashes demon blender, walks away]
|-
!Star
|Uh... she left me hangin'.
|-
!
|''Star and Wrathmelior return to the den.''
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks off-screen]
|-
!Star
|What happened here?
|-
!
|''Tom sits angrily on the couch. The table at the center of the room is destroyed and on fire.''
|-
!Dave
|Oh, there was a disagreement.
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks from behind painting]
|-
!Tom
|"Milkshake" is totally a word, Relicor!
|-
!Star
|Hey! What's this? [picks up photo album] Is this a family photo album? Oh, this will be so much fun!
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[growls happily, gestures everyone to another room]
|-
!Star
|Hey, Tom, can we talk just a second?
|-
!Tom
|I know, I know, I know. Sorry. Our Drabble games can get pretty heated.
|-
!Star
|No, no, no, no, no. It isn't that. Although, that was really scary. We'll have a conversation later. Earlier, in the kitchen, your mom seemed upset, and when I went to high five her, she totally left me hangin'.
|-
!Tom
|Star, the woman's name is Wrathmelior. She's always upset about something. Come on, let's go look at some embarrassing family photos.
|-
!
|''Cut to Tom's baby picture in the album.''
|-
!Tom
|(''o.s.'') Oh, come on, Mom! You just had to start with that one!
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[chuckles, trills]
|-
!Star
|Oh, Tom! Well, you were just the sweetest little baldy bear!
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[trilling]
|-
!
|''Wrathmelior turns the album page to Tom as a young child, holding a one-eyed pet.''
|-
!Tom
|(''o.s.'') Little Lord Fool-leroy!
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[trilling lullaby]
|-
!Dave
|[gasps] And who is this young couple?
|-
!
|''Photo shows Tom giving Star a flower at the Silver Bell Ball.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Aah! The Silver Bell Ball!
|-
!Exasperella
|Oh, here we go. The "Star and Tom" section.
|-
!
|''Photo shows Tom giving Star her horned headband.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Awww, when I got my horns.
|-
!Tom
|(''o.s.'') You mean our second date?
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[huffs, quickly turns album page]
|-
!
|''Photo shows Star and [[Pony Head]] at Star's going-away party before she leaves for Earth for the first time. Tom is in the background.''
|-
!Star
|Wait a minute. Tom, you were at my going-away party? Why don't I remember that?
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[turns the page]
|-
!Star
|Oh, my gosh. Is that when you and me had our—?
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[turns the page again]
|-
!Star
|Ohhhh! Your carriage! You took me to the [[Blood Moon Ball (event)|Blood Moon Ball]] in that.
|-
!
|''Photo shows Tom in his white suit, leaning on his carriage.''
|-
!Tom
|(''o.s.'') Yeah, that thing took forever to put together.
|-
!Star
|Wait, you ''built'' that crazy thing?
|-
!Tom
|Well, I... I made it so... so I could drive you to the Blood Moon Ball. But it didn't really go as planned, I guess.
|-
!
|''Wrathmelior stands up with a grumble. More thunder crashes outside the house. She starts crying and leaves the room.''
|-
!Dave
|[sighs] She's— You know, memories just... get her all misty-eyed. Honey? Honey! [follows Wrathmelior]
|-
!Tom
|Maybe that's enough of this. [puts photo album on bookshelf]
|-
!Star
|Okay, whatever your mom's mad about, it's definitely something I did.
|-
!Tom
|Well, she likes you, but I think she's concerned you might hurt me again.
|-
!Star
|Wait, why? Just because we broke up? Everybody breaks up! That's what teenagers do! Teenagers are dumb!
|-
!Tom
|Oh, I know, I know. I had issues I had to deal with.
|-
!Star
|Okay, well, then what is going on?
|-
!Tom
|Well, it might be... because you [[Booth Buddies|kissed]] Marco.
|-
!Star
|You knew about that? ...And you didn't say anything?!
|-
!Tom
|Oh, no! I know it wasn't on purpose! I-It was an unusual situation. You know, with that weird [[Ben Fotino|photo booth guy]] and all.
|-
!Star
|But you told your mom and you didn't tell me?
|-
!Tom
|You're not supposed to be angry. I am. If I had kissed Marco, wouldn't you want me to tell you?
|-
!Star
|Well, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, I guess.
|-
!Tom
|But... you didn't tell me.
|-
!Star
|...I gotta go.
|-
!
|''Star leaves the lake house and walks into the stormy weather.''
|-
!Tom
|Star! I know it didn't mean anything! But that doesn't mean I didn't wanna talk about it. So, I talked with my mom.
|-
!
|''Wrathmelior looks out the window and sees Star and Tom outside.''
|-
!Tom
|Let's... Let's just go inside, okay?
|-
!
|''A tidal wave of lava rises up near Tom.''
|-
!Star
|Tom!
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Wrathmelior watches in horror as the tidal wave drags Tom into the ocean.''
|-
!Tom
|Whoa! Whoa! Aah!
|-
!Star
|Oh, no! I'm coming!
|-
!
|''Star grabs her surfboard and uses her magic to jet across the lava.''
|-
!Tom
|[gasps] Aah!
|-
!
|''As Star rockets toward Tom, she dodges fireballs falling from the sky.''
|-
!Tom
|Star, it's too dangerous!
|-
!
|''Another giant tidal wave rises behind Tom.''
|-
!Tom
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Wrathmelior bursts through the door outside and sees Star's surfboard floating on the lava, broken in half.''
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[gasping and sobbing]
|-
!
|''A magic bubble washes up on shore, and Star and Tom are inside.''
|-
!Star
|Tom?
|-
!Tom
|[groans] Are you an angel?
|-
!Star
|Nah, I got a demon for a boyfriend. You okay?
|-
!Tom
|Yeah, I feel pretty good.
|-
!
|''Wrathmelior grabs Tom, holds him close, and cries tears of joy.''
|-
!Tom
|Mom, stop! I'm okay! I'm okay! Oh, jeez, you don't have to cry.
|-
!
|''Tom is engulfed in his mother's tears, and the sky clears up.''
|-
!Star
|Wha... What's happening?
|-
!Tom
|[sees a rainbow] Wait. Was that one of ''your'' storms?
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[low grunting]
|-
!Tom
|Oh, no...
|-
!Star
|[shouting] What'd she say?
|-
!Dave
|Sorry, Star. My wife has her own emotional weather system. Haven't seen a storm like that since her sister started going out with her ex-boyfriend.
|-
!Exasperella
|[slurps drink] She can have him.
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[low grunting]
|-
!Tom
|My mom says she's sorry about the storm.
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[low grunting]
|-
!Tom
|She says that sometimes her temper gets the best of her.
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[low grunting]
|-
!Tom
|And she wants to take one more picture of the two of us.
|-
!
|''Wrathmelior pushes Star and Tom together.''
|-
!Star and Tom
|Oof!
|-
!Tom
|For the family album.
|-
!Wrathmelior
|[takes Star and Tom's photo, trills]
|-
!Relicor
|[shrieks]
|-
!Dave
|Relicor says he's got two burgers with you kids' names on 'em.
|-
!Tom
|Oh, I would hate for Star to break her plans with the Diazes.
|-
!Star
|You know what? [shrieks]
|-
!Tom
|What? W-What was that?
|-
!Star
|It was demon for, "A burger sounds great."
|-
!Tom
|Ohhhh. But for the record, that's not what you said.
|-
!Star
|What?
|-
