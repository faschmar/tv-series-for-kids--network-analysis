|''Episode begins on a shot of a smoldering campfire.''
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|(''o.s.'') Deep in the sand, a wicked ember glows. Though all around, a chilling wind doth blow. With heat and spark and smoke uncurled, bring forth the fires of the [[Underworld]]!
|-
!
|''The campfire suddenly burns with flames. On the Lava Lake Beach, [[Star Butterfly|Star]], [[Marco Diaz|Marco]], [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]], and [[Kelly]] roast marshmallows over the fire. A demon girl chases a blushing skeleton across the beach holding a skull crab.''
|-
!Skeleton Guy
|[laughing]
|-
!Demon Girl
|[playfully] Get back here! I'm gonna claw you in the head!
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|I love how spoooooky Underworld beaches are.
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Isn't that kind of the Underworld's... thing?
|-
!Tom
|Yeah, it's pretty metal. Hey, Star, finished your marshmallow.
|-
!Star
|Aw, I finished yours, too! Twins.
|-
!
|''Star and Tom exchange marshmallow sticks. Tom blows on his marshmallow before they eat them.''
|-
!Marco
|Wait a second. Is that one of my hoodies?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, I gave him a spare one for the beach.
|-
!Tom
|I gave it a little custom job. You want me to do yours?
|-
!Marco
|No! [his marshmallow completely melts] Oh, man! [sighs] Kelly, can I have one of yours?
|-
![[Kelly]]
|[eating several marshmallows on a stick] Um, I actually licked all of these.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, okay, never mind.
|-
!Star
|Aw, it's okay, Marco. You can have our last one.
|-
!Tom
|[gives marshmallow to Marco] Here you go, dude.
|-
!Star
|Oh, man, the Soulrise is gonna be so great this year!
|-
!Tom
|Oh, yeah. And we got such a good spot to watch it.
|-
!
|Ulric, a big demon guy with three eyes, and his skeleton girlfriend walk up to Star, Marco, Tom, and Kelly's spot.''
|-
!Ulric
|What are you jerks doing in our spot?!
|-
!Tom
|''Your'' spot? We were here first!
|-
!Star
|Yeah, I don't see your name on it.
|-
!Ulric
|Well, maybe you need more eyes.
|-
!Tom
|Hey! Back off my girlfriend, man!
|-
!Star
|Sounds like this guy's looking for a fight.
|-
!Ulric
|There's only one way to settle this. [rips skull off a skeleton]
|-
!Marco
|[gasps]
|-
!Star and Tom
|Yeah!
|-
!Marco
|How are we settling this? How are we settling this?!
|-
!
|''Ulric tosses the burning skull into the air. When it falls back to the ground, the two sides play beach volleyball with it.
|-
!Marco
|(''o.s'') I got it! I got it!
|-
!Demon
|[changes score to 10-11] Point, Team Ulric.
|-
!Ulric
|Ha-ha!
|-
!
|''Ulric serves the ball over the net. Star bumps it back over the net, and the skeleton girl bumps it back. The ball bounces off the net and flies back at the skeleton girl, knocking her head off her body.''
|-
!Skeleton Girl
|Aah!
|-
!Star
|Kelly, it's yours!
|-
!Kelly
|[walks off the field]
|-
!
|''Ulric spikes the skeleton girl's head over the net, and Marco falls into the sand trying to catch it. Ulric and the skeleton girl's body high-five.''
|-
!Star and Tom
|What?!
|-
!Tom
|That's cheating!
|-
!Skeleton Girl
|[to Marco] Hey, your friend looked upset. Maybe you should check on her.
|-
!Marco
|Kelly! Guys, where did Kelly go?
|-
!Tom
|It's okay. We can still take these chumps. Star and I haven't even unleashed our secret weapon.
|-
!
|''Star jumps on Tom's shoulders, and they start flying around the volleyball field.''
|-
!Marco
|Fine. Marco will fix it.
|-
!Star
|Whooooo!
|-
!
|''Marco goes around the beach looking for Kelly.''
|-
!Marco
|Kelly?
|-
!Skelly (Boy)
|[pops out of sandcastle] Did you say "Skelly"?
|-
!Marco
|No, I said Kelly.
|-
!Skelly (Girl)
|[pops out from under the sand] Did someone say "Skelly"? 'Cause that's me.
|-
!Skelly (Boy)
|Oh, hey. Hey, there. I'm Skelly, too.
|-
!
|''Marco walks up to a demon couple; the girl is putting suntan lotion on the guy's back.''
|-
!Marco
|Have you guys seen my friend?
|-
!Demon Guy
|I don't know, man. But I'll fight ya.
|-
!Marco
|I just wanna find my friend. She's, like, this tall and has a lot of body hair. No?
|-
!Demon Girl
|Sounds like I could take her.
|-
!Demon Guy
|Two-on-two sound fair?
|-
!Marco
|Okay, well, uh, thanks anyway. [shuffles around demons and leaves]
|-
!Demon Girl
|He seemed nice.
|-
!
|''Marco sees Kelly at the edge of the lava by herself and goes up to her.''
|-
!Marco
|Are you okay?
|-
!Kelly
|No... Tad and I broke up.
|-
!Marco
|Oh... Sorry. I... I mean, you guys will probably work it out. You always do, you know?
|-
!Kelly
|No. This is very much the end.
|-
!Marco
|Oh. Well... I know how you feel. [[Jackie Lynn Thomas|Jackie]] and I split up, too. Hey, if you need to talk—
|-
!
|''Jorby runs up to Marco from behind and tackles him.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah! [grunts, kiais]
|-
!Jorby
|[growling]
|-
!Kelly
|Jorby! What are you doing?
|-
!Jorby
|Oh, I don't know, Kelly. What are ''you'' doing? Is this your new sparring partner? You know what? I had to fight Greg. Greg! And I killed him in, like, three seconds!
|-
!Kelly
|You didn't kill Greg.
|-
!Jorby
|Yeah, well, I killed his pride.
|-
!Marco
|Leave her alone, man! She's going through some stuff! [picks up beach umbrella]
|-
!Jorby
|We all are! Everyone's in a constant state of falling apart! Existential war cry!
|-
!Marco
|Does everyone on this stupid beach wanna fight?!
|-
!
|''Marco and Jorby start fighting.''
|-
!Kelly
|Stop! I cannot—! [sighs] I cannot deal with this much static right now! [walks away]
|-
!Jorby
|Sorry, man, I didn't know. I'd help you talk to her, but I got my own lady I gotta deal with.
|-
!
|''A goose sitting on a nearby beach towel quacks at Jorby and points at her wristwatch.''
|-
!Jorby
|I'm coming! Oh, kill me...
|-
!Marco
|Kelly, wait up! I just wanted to say if you need to talk—
|-
!Kelly
|[sputters sadly, hugs Marco] I don't know who I am anymore. All I know is I'm tired of being Tad's girlfriend, and I can't seem to move on.
|-
!Marco
|That stuff takes time.
|-
!Kelly
|I know, but... [sighs] Tad's still in here.
|-
!Marco
|He'll always be in here, but it gets easier—
|-
!Kelly
|No, Marco. He hasn't moved out yet. [points at her hair] He's still in here.
|-
!Marco
|Wait, what?
|-
!Kelly
|[whispering] He just isn't getting it, and I've already hurt him too much.
|-
!Marco
|I could try talking to him.
|-
!Kelly
|Really? Hmm, well. Maybe he'll listen to you. You are his best friend.
|-
!Marco
|[laughs nervously] I am?
|-
!Kelly
|[unfurls her ponytail and turns around] Go on in.
|-
!Marco
|In there?
|-
!Kelly
|Yeah.
|-
!Marco
|In your hair?
|-
!Kelly
|Get in "hair"! Get it? [laughs] "Get in hair"?
|-
!
|''Marco enters a large, open space inside Kelly's hair. The pizza delivery guy from "[[Crystal Clear]]" walks past him. Marco walks up to Tad, who is sulking behind a pizza box.''
|-
!Marco
|Um, hey, Tad.
|-
!Tad
|Oh, hey, bestie. [sighs] Kelly dumped me again.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, that's why I'm here. She asked me to come talk to you.
|-
!Tad
|Are we getting back together?
|-
!Marco
|No. She needs you to move out, bud.
|-
!Tad
|She keeps saying that, but I've been looking.
|-
!Marco
|Oh! That's great. Where?
|-
!Tad
|Mmm, like... on the back of these pizza boxes? Uh, inside these chip bags? At the bottom of these soda pops? [drinking soda pop]
|-
!Marco
|Look, dude, I felt the same way when Jackie and I split.
|-
!Tad
|That's your "B", man. Kelly and I break up and make up constantly. We'll get back together in no time, so why even bother getting out of this chair?
|-
!Marco
|Tad, it's for real this time.
|-
!Tad
|You're harshing my groove, Marco.
|-
!Marco
|Dude, Kelly wants to move on. You should give her that chance.
|-
!
|''Marco tries to take Tad's pizza box away, but Tad resists.''
|-
!Marco
|Come on, man!
|-
!Tad
|No! Nooo!
|-
!Marco
|You're just making yourself miserable hanging around her.
|-
!Tad
|[sighs] You're right. You're the expert.
|-
!Marco
|Well, yeah, I'm an expert in many things— Wait, what? What are you talking about?
|-
!Tad
|How you're making yourself miserable hanging around Star.
|-
!Marco
|What?! [scoffs] What does Star have to do with it? [stutters] If anything, I'm miserable because... because Jackie dumped me.
|-
!Tad
|Marco, you didn't come here for the Soulrise.
|-
!Marco
|Yes, I did.
|-
!Tad
|[puts his hands on Marco's face] Oh, Marco. Marco, Marco, Marco, Marco...
|-
!Marco
|[grunts]
|-
!Tad
|Shhh. I've been watching you all night. You have feelings for your best friend, dude.
|-
!Marco
|What?! No! No. ...No...
|-
!Tad
|Dude, you have [[dimensional scissors]]! You could be knocking back soda pops and crushing pizzas in any dimension! And you're choosing to live with your unavailable crush? When it comes to making yourself miserable, you are the master, bro.
|-
!Marco
|No, no. [slowly backing away] No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.
|-
!Tad
|Hey, Marco, are you okay? Buddy?
|-
!Marco
|No... Noooo...
|-
!
|''Marco leaves Kelly's hair. [[I Don't Wanna Know]] plays in the background. Kelly kicks over a skull just as Marco comes out of her hair.''
|-
!Kelly
|Hey, did you talk to him?
|-
!Marco
|[runs away]
|-
!Kelly
|Marco!
|-
!BGM
|♪ All my plans are falling apart ♪
|-
!
|''Marco runs around the beach with his hands over his ears. He finds Jorby and his girlfriend licking ice cream. The ice cream falls off the cone.''
|-
!Jorby
|It's okay. Ice cream melts, but our love is forever.
|-
!Marco
|[groaning, panting]
|-
!
|''Marco runs up to the demon couple who challenged him to a fight earlier.''
|-
!Demon Guy
|I'd fight anyone for you, babe.
|-
!Demon Girl
|Would you fight me?
|-
!Demon Guy
|To the death!
|-
!Demon Girl
|Awww!
|-
!Marco
|[screams]
|-
!
|''Marco runs up to the two Skellys.''
|-
!Skelly (Boy)
|I'm glad I found you, Skelly.
|-
!Skelly (Girl)
|Me too, Skelly.
|-
!Skelly (Boy)
|Being in love with your best friend is great!
|-
!
|''Marco runs away from them and runs into the demon girl and skeleton from the beginning of the episode. He also sees two skull crabs holding claws and a food-vending demon hugging a plant.''
|-
!BGM
|♪ And I don't want to see ♪<br />♪ The things that I've been shown ♪
|-
!
|''Marco continues to run until he finds Star and Tom sitting on their beach towel and kissing.''
|-
!BGM
|♪ But I can't shut my eyes ♪<br />♪ So I'll walk away alone ♪<br />♪ Tonight ♪
|-
!
|''Marco looks heartbroken. He walks away from Star and Tom with a blank expression. Later, he sits alone on the sand zipping and unzipping his hoodie.''
|-
!Kelly
|Oh, there you are. Whatever you said to Tad worked. He moved out. I feel lighter already. Also, I think the zipper works, so... Yeah, you don't need to...
|-
!Marco
|I'm glad that that worked out for you.
|-
!Kelly
|I know that face. Come on, Kelly's driving. [pulls Marco across the sand, grunting]
|-
!Marco
|I'll walk!
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly walk along the beach.''
|-
!Kelly
|You know, Tad and I? We used to come to every Soulrise.
|-
!Marco
|So why come here now?
|-
!Kelly
|I love the Soulrise. I don't want it to be a place that makes me sad. The only thing I could think to do was face it. Rewrite it so it was mine again.
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly walk up to a black and red lifeguard tower.''
|-
!Marco
|Where... are we? Should we even be here?
|-
!Kelly
|It's the best view of the Soulrise!
|-
!
|''Kelly tosses a skull into the tower, and it dislodges the ladder entrance underneath.''
|-
!Kelly
|Ladder!
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly climb to the top of the tower.''
|-
!Marco
|Wow. You can see everything.
|-
!Kelly
|Told ya!
|-
!Marco
|I guess we should go find Star and Tom, huh?
|-
!Kelly
|They don't need this. They haven't earned it.
|-
!
|''The lava starts to ripple. Marco takes off his hoodie and drapes it around Kelly.''
|-
!Kelly
|Uh, what are you doing?
|-
!Marco
|Oh, I was just... trying to... warmthen... you... You know... You looked cold. [groans]
|-
!
|''Kelly moves closer to Marco and drapes half of the hoodie around him.''
|-
!Kelly
|Thanks. I... I was cold.
|-
!
|''The lava continues to ripple as black clouds gather in the sky. A giant eyeball rises out of the lava and emits a beam of bright light Souls start to swim up the beam and release into the sky. Screeching skeleton demons fly overhead.''
|-
!Marco
|Is... Is that thing...?
|-
!
|''One of the flying skeletons flies past Marco's face.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah! Oh! Ha-ha! Sorry.
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly continue watching the Soulrise together.''
|-
!Marco
|Is it past midnight?
|-
!Kelly
|[looks at her watch] Yeah.
|-
!Marco
|Then it's my birthday.
|-
!Kelly
|Happy birthday, Marco Diaz.
