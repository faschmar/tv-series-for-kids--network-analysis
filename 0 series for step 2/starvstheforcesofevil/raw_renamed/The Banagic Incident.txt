|''Episode begins at the [[Diaz Household]]. [[Star Butterfly|Star]] is reading magazines in the bathtub.''
|-
!'''[[Star Butterfly]]'''
|[while flipping the pages] No... No... Nope... Reading in the tub is not... a sure-fire fun way to spice up a dull day. Hmm... Today might be the day I face my biggest fear: Boredom... Maybe today is the day I renounce my vow to never have a dull day!
|-
!
|''Star picks up her wand.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Today, I will look boredom in its eyes, those beady little black eyes, like tiny little black fists, I'll look into those eyes and I will say... Oh wait, never mind, what's this?
|-
!
|''Star looks at a magazine.''
|-
!Star
|Oh! "The Banagic Wand, Earth's coolest magical treat." [gasps] Earth magic! I swear to baby dolphin giggles, I will find the Banagic Wand before this day is done... or die trying. Or my name's not Star Butterfly! As me as my witness, I'll never go bored again! And anything else I'm supposed to say to make this official! Whoo-hoo!
|-
!
|''Star runs away from the bathtub and then goes back to the bathtub.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|I don't know where I'm going. Hmmm...
|-
!
|''Star looks at the Banagic Wand page.''
|-
!Star
|Ah, "As featured on TV." But I saw it in this magazine. Hmm. Aha! A riddle [Laughs]. But I'm terrible at riddles. Need Marco.
|-
!
|''Marco inhales deeply as he is about to chop a plank of wood. Star suddenly replaces the plank of wood with herself.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Marco!
|-
!'''[[Marco Diaz]]'''
|Ah! [shocked, accidently hits his face then falls down]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Earth magic. Look.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|That thing from TV?
|-
!'''Star'''
|[gasps] You've seen it?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Yeah, it's one of those late night commercials.
|-
!'''Star'''
|So it does exist. To the TV!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|I can't. I've gotta get to my karate class.
|-
!
|''Star pulls Marco to the TV and then turns the TV on.''
|-
!'''TV Doctor'''
|Your new kidney came from a werwolf.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Glitter Grenade Rewind.
|-
!
|''The TV rewinds. It then shows two kids on-screen.''
|-
!'''Kid #1'''
|It's so hot.
|-
!'''Kid #2'''
|And I'm so bored.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco observe the commercial.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|What are they gonna do?
|-
!'''Announcer'''
|The Banagic Wand! It's a little bit of banana, and a little lot of magic.<br />Designed by leading freeze-ologists, the Banagic Wand uses state-of-the-art molecular ice-stronomy to frostulate your sizzle zones and CHILL YOU OUT!!!
|-
!'''Kid #2'''
|Mmm.
|-
!'''Kid #1'''
|I'm totally chilled out.
|-
!'''Kid #2'''
|There's enough Banagic fun "For all my friends to enjoy".
|-
!
|''All the kids scream happily.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Friendship magic.
|-
!'''Announcer'''
|Available at better stores near you.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Better stores?
|-
!'''Announcer'''
|Supplies are limited! Get yours now!
|-
!'''Star'''
|[Gasps] Supplies are limited. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
|-
!
|''Star puts a bike helmet on Marco and throws him out the door.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|I can't. I have karate. Today we're learning how to channel our emotions.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[Excited] To a better store near us!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Did you hear anything I just said?
|-
!'''Star'''
|[Humming] ðŸŽµA little bit of banana, a little lot of magicðŸŽµ
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Star, I can't go now. And I'm not sure you have a firm enough grasp on Earth culture to go on your own.
|-
!
|''Star goes to the mailman.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Hey, get out of our yard box, you scoundrel! Hide your dragon eggs somewhere else. Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.
|-
!
Marco
|[groans]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Marco, we're not moving. You push these little thingies with your feet. Honestly, Marco, sometimes I wonder if you have a firm grasp on this Earth stuff.
|-
!
|''Marco paddles the bike slowly.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Oh, too slow. Bunny Rocket Blast!
|-
!
|''The spell propels the bike and its occupants to the plaza where the Karate Dojo is. Star kicks the Dojo's door open and sees all the Karate stuff inside.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Karate class? Marco, we don't have time for detours. The commercial said we have to hurry while supplies last. Focus on the quest.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|This is where I'm going. Karate. I am not going with you.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Dear, sweet Marco. I commend him for making it this far on the journey, and vow to complete the quest in his honor. Good-bye, sweet Marco.
|-
!
|''Star cartwheels out of Karate class and into the Record store. She then looks around, noticing the cashier and quickly hiding. She peeks on a beardy, fanged cashier.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|The store is guarded by a werewolf.
|-
!
|''Star goes to the cashier.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|I wish you no harm, werewolf. All I seek is the Banagic Wand. Is this a better store?
|-
!'''Cashier'''
|Uh, better than what?
|-
!'''Star'''
|[groans] [frustrated] More riddles. I wish Marco was still with us.
|-
![[Sensei Brantley]]
|You must learn to channel what is deep inside you. [points at Marco] Diaz, name an emotion!
|-
!Marco
|Uhh, hunger!
|-
!Sensei
|Channel your hunger Diaz! Channel your emotions to brave the Gauntlet of Fire!
|-
!Marco
|Wait, we're gonna walk on those?
|-
!
|''[[Jeremy Birnbaum|Jeremy]] laughs maliciously. In the meantime, Star walks out the store while a couple of pedestrians pass by.''
|-
!Male pedestrian
|That one's okay, but there's a better store down on Main and Riverside.
|-
!Star
|A better store near me.
|-
!
|''Star intercepts the pedestrians.''
|-
!Star
|There's a better store on Main and Riverside?
|-
!Male pedestrian
|Uhh, yeah?
|-
!Star
|Woo-hoo!
|-
!
|''Star runs away happily, but comes back to ask directions.''
|-
!Star
|Which way is Main and Riverside?
|-
!
|''The pedestrian gives Star the right way and she runs away in the indicated direction. The scene cuts to the Dojo, where the coal walking mayhem continues.''
|-
!Sensei
|Diaz, approach.
|-
!
|''Marco tries to do the walk, but quickly burns his feet.''
|-
!Jeremy
|Classic Marco, grieving in agony.
|-
!Marco
|[groans]
|-
!
|''Back to Star, she is trying to figure out where the store is.''
|-
!Star
|OK... I'm on Main Street. Now, where is riverside?
|-
!
|''Walks down the street and finds a river.''
|-
!Star
|Ah, a river and its side!, I found it!, like I knew I would.
|-
!
|''She high fives a cyclist on a tall bike. Later, she enters in a store, "The Salty Barnacle Club", a pirate themed restaurant.''
|-
!Pirate Worker
|[pirate voice] Ahoy, Matey.
|-
!
|''Star looks at the place, distrustful at what she thinks is a real pirate organization.''
|-
!Star
|Pirates...
|-
!Pirate Worker
|That's what we are! Now come with me to Davey Jones's Fish Locker.
|-
!
|''Star follows the worker, thinking that she is really being kidnapped.''
|-
!Star
|Okay pirate... I am at your mercy for I am but your helpless prisoner.
|-
!
|''Star approaches a dinning couple''
|-
!Star
|Not true, I'm a powerful princess from another dimension, and I'm gonna get us all out of here. Freedom is Nigh!
|-
!Pirate Worker
|Arrgh, ma'am?
|-
!
|''Star keeps following the "pirate", who gets her a seat and a table. Two workers approach her, and she quickly dispatches them.''
|-
!Star
|Surrender, pirates!
|-
!
|She starts attacking the "pirates".
|-
!Star
|Surrender bloodthirsty savages!
|-
!Barmaid
|Enough!
|-
!Star
|Do you surrender, pirate?
|-
!Barmaid
|We aren't pirates. This is a Pirate-Themed restaurant.
|-
!
|''Star realizes her error.''
|-
!Star
|Do you know where I can find a better store?
|-
!
|''The remaining workers chase Star angrily out of the place and down the streets, where she spots a "Better Store".''
|-
!Star
|A Better Store...
|-
!
|''While the angry mob keeps chasing her, Star jumps at a lady's supermarket cart, which she proceeds to ride to the promised place, almost being run over by a bus.''
|-
![[Brittney Wong]]
|Miranda I swear, if you wear fuzzy boots at my party, I will break your feet off!
|-
!
|''Star's cart falls right in front of Brittney.''
|-
!Brittney
|What the...?
|-
!Star
|Oh Brittney, you gotta help me! There's an angry mob after me! Could you just throw them off my trail and tell them I went that way? Thanks, bye.
|-
!
|''Star enters the store. The angry mob approaches Brittney.''
|-
!Brittney
|She went in there.
|-
!
|''Back to the Dojo, where Marco is trying to do the walk.''
|-
!Jeremy
|[while recording the scene] Here we have Marco Diaz approaching the goblet of fire, it's been a tough 14 years for Diaz: no girlfriend, can't seem to get past green belt, that history of failure must be suffocating him right now...
|-
!Marco
|Jeremy get out of here, I'm trying to channel my emotions!
|-
!
|''Jeremy takes a picture of the angry Marco. Marco goes back to the goblet and tries to channel his emotions.''
|-
!Jeremy
|Fail, fail, fail...
|-
!Marco
|ENOUGH!
|-
!
|''Marco tries to catch Jeremy and chases him through all the dojo, and finally succeeds after a trophy falls on Jeremy's head.''
|-
!Marco
|You little twerp!
|-
!Sensei
|Diaz, wait, you did it!
|-
!
|''Marco realizes that he managed to control his emotions through anger, as he is stepping in the coals.''
|-
!Marco
|[laughs] I did it. I understand now sensei.
|-
!Sensei
|Diaz.
|-
!Marco
|This was all a part...
|-
!Sensei
|Diaz.
|-
!Marco
|...of your plan, you had Jeremy act to me like this to give aâ€”
|-
!Sensei
|Diaz! Foot fire buddy!
|-
!
Marco
|[screams loudly]
|-
!
|''Back to Star's quest, she is looking shocked at a pile of boxes containing the mighty "Banagic Wand". And while she is doing that a random shopper joins her amazement.''
|-
!Random Shopper
|They're magnificent, aren't they?
|-
!
|''Star takes a box of Banagic Wand.''
|-
!Barmaid
|You! It's time to pay for what you've done!
|-
!Random Shopper
|Are they talking to you?
|-
!Star
|Mm-hmm.
|-
!
|''The random shopper walks away from the scene slowly. The angry workers corner Star to the aforementioned "Banagic Wand" boxes pile.''
|-
!Barmaid
|Wreck my store?! I'll show you!
|-
!
|''Star aims the wand at the people.''
|-
!Star
|Ok guys, you need to chill out... The Banagic Wand [humming] ðŸŽµA little bit of banana, a little lot of magicðŸŽµ. Designed by leading freeze-ologists, the Banagic Wand uses state-of-the-art molecular ice-stronomy to frostulate your sizzle zones and CHILL YOU OUT!!!

|''Back to the Diaz household. Marco just enters through the front door.''
|-
!Marco
|Star, I'm back! Still wanna go...?
|-
!
|''Marco gets surprised at the scene of his living room, where Star is enjoying a cup of Banagic ice cream with all the "pirates".''
|-
!Star
|Hey, Marco. I conquered my boredom!
|-
!
|''The people laugh along with Star.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey.
|-
!Star
|Here. [hands over a cup of Banagic Ice Cream to Marco] I went downtown by myself.
|-
!Marco
|I know, I was there...
|-
!Star
|It was way easy... I guess you can say I've totally mastered Earth.
|-
!Marco
|Sorry, I underestimated you.
|-
!Star
|[surprised] You underestimated me?
|-
!Marco
|Ehmmm, yeah, I did. Sorry. This stuff looks delicious though.
|-
!
|''Star pushes Marco's Banagic bowl out of his hands, making him drop it.''
|-
!Marco
|Why did youâ€”
|-
!Star
|There was a fly on it. [walks away]
