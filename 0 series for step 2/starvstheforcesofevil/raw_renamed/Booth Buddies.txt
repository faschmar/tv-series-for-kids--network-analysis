!Star
|Isn't this just beautiful? It's too bad [[Pony Head]] never showed up.
|-
!Tom
|Yeah. The photo booth isâ€”
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Photo booth.
|-
!Tom
|Okay. Well, I'm just gonna go get some pie, then.
|-
!Star
|No way! [gasps]

!Marco
|Star, can I go?
|-
!Star
|Oh, my gosh!
|-
!
|''Star reaches over Marco's head and pulls an old reel of photos of herself and Marco off the wall.''
|-
!Star
|Look! Old photos from our days at the [[Bounce Lounge]].
|-
!Marco
|Can we just take photos some other time?
|-
!Star
|Sure, as soon as we take some photos.
|-
!Marco
|[groans]
|-
!Star
|[holding out her hand]
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!Star
|Money.
|-
!Marco
|Excuse me?
|-
!Star
|What? Money. Gimme, gimme. [reaches into Marco's jacket] Now, come on! Where is it?
|-
!Marco
|Star, I'm not made of money!
|-
!Star
|Yes, you are. Oh! Found it. Ohh! [pulls out a bundle of cash] Six hundred fifty dollars! See, Marco? You're a boy made of money.
|-
!Marco
|[glares at Star]
|-
!Star
|Yeah, yeah, that should be enough.
|-
!
|''Star puts a five-dollar bill in the photo machine.''
|-
!Star
|First, let's do a silly one.
|-
!
|''Star makes a silly face, and the camera clicks.''
|-
!Star
|Ooh! Okay, now a fighting stance. Hi-yah!
|-
!
|''Star makes a fighting pose, and the camera clicks.''
|-
!Star
|Ooh! Okay, now let's do one where we're stuck inside a monster's belly, and we're slowly drowning in its toxic stomach acid. Blech!
|-
!
|''Star dramatically slides down Marco's body, and the camera clicks.''
|-
!Marco
|Okay. I go now. [starts walking away]
|-
!Star
|Wait! [pulls Marco back] One more! Best friends pose.
|-
!
|''Star makes a cool pose, and the camera clicks. The machine prints out a reel of photos.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! Here we go! [looks at photos] What the...? Marco, what is this?
|-
!Marco
|They look like photos.
|-
!Star
|These aren't photos. They're travesties.
|-
!Marco
|Geez, Star.
|-
!Star
|I asked for best friend photos, but these are business acquaintance photos. Soooo...
|-
!Marco
|Okay, let me look at the old photos. What do we got here? Happy-go-lucky, fish face, "Oops, I did it again," too cool for school. Okay. Let's do it.
|-
!
|''Star puts another five-dollar bill in the photo machine. She and Marco put their arms around each other and smile at the camera, and the camera clicks. They make silly faces for the second click, make "Oops, I did it again" faces for the third click, and make cool poses for the fourth click. The machine prints out another reel.''
|-
!Star
|Ooh! [looks at photos]
|-
!Marco
|Perfect! Well, see ya!
|-
!Star
|[grabs Marco by the ankle]
|-
!Marco
|You know you have my ankle, right?
|-
!Star
|Something's... Something's not right.
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!
|''Star looks at the two sets of photos side-by-side.''
|-
!Marco
|These are exactly the same. I don't know what you want.
|-
!Star
|I want ''your'' face to look like ''this'' face.
|-
!Marco
|I was just making that face!
|-
!Star
|Yours was a fake face. This is a best friend face. [puts five dollars in the machine] I know the difference.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco smile for the camera, and the camera clicks.''
|-
!Star
|Nope, that's not it. [puts five dollars in the machine]
|-
!
|''Marco smiles again for the camera, and the camera clicks.''
|-
!Star
|Something's off. [puts five dollars in the machine]
|-
!
|''Marco smiles yet again for the camera, and the camera clicks.''
|-
!Star
|These are all travesties! Enough shenanigans. It's time to get real. [takes out a hundred-dollar bill] Too big to fail.
|-
!
|''Star puts the hundred-dollar bill in the machine, and the camera clicks over and over.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Come on, Marco!
|-
!
|''The machine prints out another photo reel.''
|-
!Marco
|Star, I'm trying.
|-
!Star
|I know you are, Marco. But it's not good enough!
|-
!
|''The machine prints out reel after reel after reel of photos and eventually gets jammed. An alarm goes off.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|Hmm?
|-
!
|''A large metal door suddenly closes over the booth entrance. Marco tries breaking it down, but fails.''
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] We're stuck!
|-
!
|''The sound of a revving engine is heard outside the photo booth.''
|-
!Marco
|[gasps] Oh, no!
|-
!
|''Outside the booth, Kelly revs up Nachos' engine.''
|-
!Kelly
|[laughing] Oh, yeah!
|-
!Marco
|Help! [pounds on metal door] Let us out! It's an emergency!
|-
!
|''The photo booth briefly shakes, and a diamond-shaped panel on top lights up. The panel opens up, and [[Ben Fotino]] pops out. He slides down the side of the booth and looks at Star and Marco through the metal door's small window.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|Aah!
|-
!Marco
|Star? What the heck is that?
|-
!Star
|[mumbles "I don't know"]
|-
![[Ben Fotino]]
|Did somebody say... "emergency"?
|-
!Marco
|Who are you?
|-
!Ben
|I'm Ben Fotino! Booth repair extraordinaire! [laughs]
|-
!Marco
|Does Pony Head know you live in her photo booth?
|-
!Ben
|Does a hot dog have bones in it?
|-
!Marco
|Dude, I don't know. Can you let us out of here, please?
|-
!Ben
|Well, I'd like to, but I can't. It's broken. Gonna have to take it back to my shop for repairs. [sinister chuckle]
|-
!Marco
|Wait. What's happening?
|-
!
|''Handlebars appear on the side of the booth, and Ben hops on.''
|-
!Ben
|[cackling]
|-
!Marco
|Where are you taking us? No! No! No, no, no, no, no, no! Let us out of here!
|-
!
|''The booth levitates into the air and takes off into the sky.''
|-
!Marco
|[panics] We gotta get out of here!
|-
!
|''Marco opens up the booth seat and sees a horrible monster inside.''
|-
!Monster
|[screeching]
|-
!Marco
|[screams, closes seat, panting]
|-
!
|''Ben drives the booth to his repair shop, crashing it down through the ceiling.''
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] Hey... Hey, Ben? Could you get us out of here, please?!
|-
!Ben
|Gotta get my mind juices warmed up. [drinks bottle of soda] Ahhh... [walks up to booth] Hmm.
|-
!
|''Ben pulls at the photo reels jamming the machine and unjams it, and hundreds of reels pour out of the printing machine.''
|-
!Ben
|Aah! Whoa, whoa! [looks at photos] Hmm... Hmmmmm... Well, I think I found your problem.
|-
!Marco
|Really?
|-
!Ben
|Now, this here photo booth ain't just any photo booth.
|-
!Star
|Is it... Is it magic?
|-
!Ben
|It's magic!
|-
!Star
|[delighted gasp]
|-
!Marco
|Oh, no.
|-
!Ben
|This booth can look deep into your soul, seeing all truths that lie beneath them pictures.
|-
!Star
|Wow...
|-
!Marco
|Well, what does it want from us?
|-
!Ben
|Heck if I know. I ain't no magic photo booth.
|-
!Marco
|Ugh. I hate magic.
|-
!Star
|[slaps Marco on the back] Marco!
|-
!Marco
|Sorry.
|-
!Star
|I told you something was up with those photos, bub. I knew it. The booth knew it. Your face knew it.
|-
!Marco
|What does my face know?
|-
!Star
|That we're not taking best friends photos.
|-
!
|''Star puts yet another five-dollar bill in the photo machine.''
|-
!Star
|[forces Marco's face to smile] Give the people what they want!
|-
!
|''The camera clicks several times, and the machine prints out another reel.''
|-
!Ben
|Well, this is gonna take a while. [sits on recliner] Good luck getting out of that death trap. [snoring]
|-
!Star
|All right, what's going on here? You used to love the photo booth. You're my little camera hog.
|-
!Marco
|I'm... I'm just worried about Nachos. And call me crazy, but I didn't want to end up on a magical adventure today. But nope, magical adventure.
|-
!Ben
|[snoring]
|-
!Star
|Well, I like our adventures, and I thought you liked them, too. And we only got one money left.
|-
!Marco
|What?! Where'd it go?!
|-
!Star
|Photo booths are expensive. Plus, I gave a tip to Ben.
|-
!Ben
|[holding a bunch of money bills] Much obliged.
|-
!Star
|This is all we got left.
|-
!
|''Marco looks at the old reel of photos again.''
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] You wanna know what's different in this photo? This was before.
|-
!Star
|Before what?
|-
!Marco
|Before you told me... you... had a crush on me.
|-
!Star
|[stares blankly, gasps, sighs] I just blacked out. Mmm... Go on.
|-
!Marco
|Well, I was caught off-guard by it. And then like a Marco, I never brought it up again. And that stunk. I stunk.
|-
!Star
|Well, a lot was going on. But yeah, that stunk.
|-
!Marco
|It's getting harder to end up on these adventures pretending things aren't different.
|-
!Star
|Are they?
|-
!Marco
|They are for me.
|-
!Star
|Oh. Oh! OH! Like different, different?
|-
!Marco
|[sighs, groans]
|-
!Star
|Well, no wonder we're stuck here hearing truth bombs like that.
|-
!Marco
|[imitates explosion]
|-
!Star
|Weird question, but what do your guts feel like?
|-
!Marco
|My guts?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, my guts were all like, [gibbers] You know?
|-
!Marco
|Uh, my guts are more like, [long groan]
|-
!Star
|[chuckles] Well, they do feel better after you talk about it.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, I guess.
|-
!Star
|Last photo. Anything you need to tell me?
|-
!Marco
|No. But there's one last thing I need to do.
|-
!Star
|What's that?
|-
!Marco
|[grabs last five-dollar bill] Take the photo the booth is waiting for.
|-
!Star
|Go get 'em, tiger!
|-
!Marco
|[exhales sharply]
|-
!
|''Marco inserts the bill into the photo machine. On the first camera click, he and Star smile into the camera. On the second click, he looks over at Star. On the third click, she looks back at him. On the fourth click, they kiss. They stare at each other in shock.''
|-
!Marco
|Uhhhh...
|-
!Star
|Uhhhh...
|-
!
|''Rowdy circus-style music starts playing, and the metal door opens up.''
|-
!Ben
|Congratulations! [throwing confetti] Three cheers for the happy new couple! Hip, hip...!
|-
!Star and Marco
|[still stunned]
|-
!Ben
|Hip, hip...!
|-
!Star and Marco
|[still stunned]
|-
!Ben
|Huzzah!
|-
!Star
|[long groan]
|-
!Marco
|Star? I'm sorry! It's just the booth! It's magic!
|-
!Ben
|[giggles]
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!Ben
|That photo booth ain't magic. It's just a booth! [laughing]
|-
!Marco
|Did... Did you trap us in there?
|-
!Ben
|Look, I seen a lot of pictures in my day, and your photo showed two young'uns who needed a smooch.
|-
!Marco
|You trapped us in there.
|-
!Ben
|I trapped you in there. Okay, back in the booth.
|-
!
|''Ben pushes Star and Marco back into the booth and drives the booth back to the wedding. Star and Marco sit together in silence.''
|-
!Star
|We... kissed.
|-
!Marco
|I thought the booth was magic.
|-
!Star
|You're my squire.
|-
!Marco
|Which is a job I take very seriously.
|-
!Star
|I have a boyfriend. His name is Tom.
|-
!Marco
|I was just trying to get us out of here! [buries his face under his suit]
|-
!Star
|Hey...
|-
!Marco
|[looks at Star]
|-
!Star
|I'm glad you were honest with me. Just maybe not ''that'' honest.
|-
!Marco
|I'm sorry.
|-
!Star
|At least it can't get more awkward.
|-
!
|''The booth suddenly stops moving, and Star falls onto Marco. They look at each other and quickly leave the photo booth.''
|-
!Marco
|Okay.
|-
!Star
|That's enough photo booth.
|-
!Ben
|Now, if you kids need any more help, you know where to find me.
|-
!
|''Ben goes back inside the diamond-shaped panel at the top of the photo booth.''
|-
!Marco
|Creep.
|-
![[Nachos]]
|[slurping water]
|-
!Marco
|Nachos! [sighs] Oh, I was so worried you took her out on a joyride.
|-
!Kelly
|[with blown-back hair] Eh, ye of little faith.
|-
!
|''Marco briefly looks nonplussed. He and Kelly get on Nachos together.''
|-
!Marco
|See yaâ€” I'll see ya later, Star.
|-
!
|''Marco, Kelly, and Nachos drive off into the sky. She turns around and looks completely stunned. Tom walks over holding a plate of pie.''
|-
!Tom
|Hey, boo, sorry. I've been off falling in love... with this pie! [laughs] Man, it's getting pretty serious. [kisses Star on the cheek] Am I the only one who loves this pie?
|-
!
|''Star's compact phone rings.''
|-
!Tom
|Hey, there's your phone.
|-
!Star
|[answers phone] Hello? ... [drops phone] Something's wrong with Pony. [drags Tom away by the arm]
|-
!Tom
|Aah!
|-
!
|''The photo reel of Star and Marco kissing is left behind in the photo booth's printer. Star briefly returns to grab it, and as it is pulled off-screen, the photo of Star and Marco kissing shows their cheek marks glowing. The Blood Moon shines in the sky.''
