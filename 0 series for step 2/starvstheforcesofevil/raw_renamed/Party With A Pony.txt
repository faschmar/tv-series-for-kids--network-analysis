|-
!Marco
|Where are we?
|-
!
|''Camera zooms out to show the entire [[Bounce Lounge]].''

|-
!Star
|Marco! Photo booth, photo booth! Come on! [giggles]
|-
!
|''Star shoves Pony Head and Marco into the booth. She pops up between them in the booth, and they take several photos. In the first photo, the three smile, and captions read "yay", "good times" and "Happy Besties!"

|-
!
|''The booth takes another photo of Marco and Pony Head smiling, and captions read "LETS ENJOY", "HAY GURL!", and "PARTY LIFE".''

|Pony Head just tried to shove me off this cloud!
|-
!Star

!Marco
|Well, she also threatened to skewer me in the photo booth!
|-
!Pony Head
|(''o.s.'') Whoo! Yes!
|-
!Star

|-
!
|''Pony Head goes through the portal.''
|-
!Star
|[sing-songy] She's warming up to you.
|-
!
|''Star pushes Marco through the portal and follows him, plugging her nose as if about to dive into water. Scene transitions; Marco is wide-eyed and drooling.''

!Marco
|Holy pixels!
|-
!
|''Camera zooms out to show the whole Amethyst Arcade.''
|-
!Marco
|So many video games!
|-

|-
!Star
|Ewww. Oh! I'll go get us some nice cold icicles to put on your disgusting sweaty back.
|-
!
|''A square plays a Whack-a-Mole!-like video game. The three masked men approach from behind.''
|-
!Masked Man
|Hey, you. Square.

!Masked Man
|Have you seen this head?
|-
!Square #1
|[confused grunt]
|-
!Masked Man
|Don't lie to me, little man.

!Marco
|Hah! Who's the turd now?
|-
!Pony Head
|[flies off-screen] Still you!
|-
!Square #2
|Uh, I think I'm next. But with less abusive trash talk, please.
|-
!
|''Star waits in line at the icicle stand.''
|-
!Square #3
|Um, let's see. Do I want the pointy one or the pointier one? Oh, it's such a tough choice.
|-
!Pony Head
|[flies up to Star] Hey, Star, I'm bored. Uh, I know this other club, so let's bounce. Bleh!
|-
!
|''Pony Head takes out her dimensional scissors.''
|-
!Star
|Sounds cool. I'll go get Marco.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, no-no-no-no-no. He went on ahead. Um, yes, he wanted to save us a good spot in the mosh pit. Yes, that is the course of events.
|-
!Star
|Oh, classic Marco. Always putting friends first.
|-
!
|''Star jumps through the portal, and Pony Head follows. Cut back to Lance Lance Revolution.''

|Finish him! You win!
|-
!Marco
|Hah! Did you see that, Star? Try and beat that, Pointy Head! ...Star? Pointy Head?
|-
!
|''The three masked men surround Marco. One puts his hand on Marco's shoulder, and the shortest one breathes heavily. Cut to an underwater club called the [[Scum Bucket]]. Star and Pony Head laugh and crowd-surf.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Is this not a blast or what, B-Fly?
|-
!Star
|Yeah-heah! But I don't see Marco anywhere.
|-
!Pony Head
|Pfft! You got me, girl. And I'm way more fun!
|-
!Star
|Uh, what are you talking about?
|-
!Pony Head
|Uh, heh, funny story. You're gonna love it. ...I kinda ditched him and left him in the other dimension. Oops. [chuckling]
|-
!Star
|What?! [screams, falls to the floor]
|-
!Pony Head
|B-Fly!
|-
!Star
|How could you do that to my best friend?!
|-
!Pony Head
|Best friend?! Last time I checked, the best friend was me!
|-
!Star
|I can have two best friends. Unless one of them is a friend-ditching liar.
|-
!Pony Head
|That Earth Turd means that much to you?
|-
!Star
|He's the best turd I've ever known.
|-
!Pony Head
|[sighs] Okay.
|-
!
|''Cut back to the Amethyst Arcade. Marco is tied to a chair as the masked men shine a lamp in his face and interrogate him.''
|-
!Masked Man
|For the last time... where is she?!
|-
!Marco
|[crying] I'm telling you! I don't know!
|-
!Masked Man
|Not talking, eh? What if I do... this?! [flickers lamp on and off]
|-
!Marco
|Stop! That's ''really'' annoying!
|-
!
|''Star and Pony Head emerge from a portal.''

|Wait, B-Fly! It's too dangerous, girl! ...Hold out your hand. Bleh!
|-
!

|-
!Masked Men
|Huh? [screams]
|-
!Pony Head
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''Pony Head slams into a wall and falls to the ground. The masked men approach her. Star and Marco jump in front of Pony Head to protect her.''

|Back off, creeps!
|-

|Hello, Daddy.
|-
!King Pony Head
|Hello, princess.
|-
!Star
|[whispering] What is he doing here?
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, B-Fly, it's the end of the line for me. But at least I got in one last night of fun with you, girl.
|-
!Star
|One last night? Before what?
|-
!Pony Head
|Before this! I'm going to St. O's!
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Not [[St. Olga's Reform School for Wayward Princesses]]?!
|-
!
|''Thunder strikes. Cut to shot of Pony Head being sent to St. Olga's Reform School on a conveyor belt while screaming. Cut back to Star and Pony Head at the Amethyst Arcade.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, it's true. I did it to myself. I'm headed to the slammer.
|-
!King Pony Head
|It's reform school, cupcake, not jail. Although admittedly it is a lot like jail.
|-
!Star
|Oh, Pony Head! You knew you'd get sent to St. Olga's, but you still came back to save Marco.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, well, you know... It's hard to say it, but he ''is'' your other bestie. Okay, I said it.
|-

|Ohhhh... Come here!
|-
!

!
|''Pony Head stops to look back at Marco.''
|-
!Marco
|Good luck in princess jail.

!Pony Head
|Aw. Thanks, Earth Tu— I mean, thank you, Marco. But don't worry about me! No jail can hold on to me for long! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
|-
!
|''Pony Head is dragged through the portal.''
|-
!King Pony Head
|[sighs] Kids... You have 'em, and then you... wish they weren't around.
|-
!
|''King Pony Head goes through the portal, and it closes behind him.''
|-
!Star
|Yay! My besties ''are'' besties!
|-
!Marco
|Yeah... I wouldn't go that far. Hey! We're stuck in another dimension!
|-
!Star
|Oh, no, we're not. Bleh!
|-
!
|''Star reveals Pony Head's dimensional scissors.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa!
