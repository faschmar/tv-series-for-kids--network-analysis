|''Episode begins in [[Star Butterfly|Star]] and [[Marco Diaz|Marco]]'s shared quarters in the Monster Temple. Star and [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]] are packing beach supplies onto a wagon.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|All right. Sunglasses, flip-flops, colorful umbrella, and a cooler stocked with snacks. I am so ready for this day! [looks at Beach Day photo]
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|Hey, I know that picture is from the future, but how come I'm not in it?
|-
!Star
|You're gonna be the one taking the photo, silly goose.
|-
!Tom
|Ohhhh! Well, yeah, yeah. No, that makes sense. I-I do have a better eye for composition.
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|[opens door] Hey, guys? No making fun.
|-
!
|''[[Marco Diaz|Marco]] enters wearing an oversized purple cloth.''
|-
!Tom
|[takes Marco's picture, laughs]
|-
!Star
|Uh, Marco? What's going on, uh, here?
|-
!Marco
|I couldn't find my swimsuit, so Eclipsa let me borrow one of [[Globgor]]'s old ones.
|-
!Tom
|Instant classic.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, I didn't think this would work.
|-
!
|''There's a soft knock at the door.''
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]
|Star, um, could I borrow you for a moment?
|-
!Star
|Of course! You guys, keep on packing up snacks. I'll be right back. [puts her sun hat on Marco's head]
|-
!
|''[[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]] leads Star into Globgor's temple chamber.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Sorry to take you away from your friends, but I'm in a bit of a bind at the moment.
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''[[Rhombulus]] floats at the center of a dark vortex in the air. He has bugs and worms on him, his right shoulder is encased in ice, his left leg is contorted around his back, and his snake arms are eating each other.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Is that... Rhombulus?! What did you do to him?
|-
!Eclipsa
|It's been so long since I've wielded magic, things got a little out of hand. It's far worse than I ever meant. In the heat of the moment, one spell led to another, andâ€”
|-
!Star
|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Back up and explain, please.
|-
!Eclipsa
|All I did was ask Rhombulus if he would use his powers to free Globgor from his crystal. But he got mad, heated words were exchanged, yadda-yadda-yadda... I think he might be dead.
|-
!Star
|What?!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, dead or in a dreamless sleep forever. I'm not sure which. I didn't know what to do, so I brought him back here.
|-
!Star
|Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait. Didn't the entire kingdom see you do that?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, no, I'm pretty sneaky. Any progress, [[Glossaryck]]?
|-
![[Glossaryck]]
|Progress? [laughs] I don't work for you. [pokes Rhombulus' arm] Poke.
|-
!Star
|[her phone rings] Hold on a second, will you? [answers phone]
|-
!Marco
|[on phone] Hey, uh, Star? Glossaryck let me borrow one of his swim trunks, but I think they're too small.
|-
!Glossaryck
|[on phone] They look great on him!
|-
!Star
|Huh? Glossaryck? Are you in two places at once?!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Sometimes...
|-
!Glossaryck
|[on phone] ...one place isn't interesting enough.
|-
!Marco
|Can I just get your opinion on these trunks before we go? [angles phone downward]
|-
!Star
|[blushes] Marco, I am busy! Just pick a swimsuit! [closes phone] Okay, here we go, Glossaryck. How do we fix this?
|-
!Glossaryck
|I dunno. I told Eclipsa to ask you.
|-
!Star
|What?! I can't fix this! Ugh! Eclipsa, can't you just undo your spells? You know, in reverse?
|-
!Eclipsa
|In reverse. Of course. I don't know why I didn't think of that. Thank you, Star. I knew you'd have the answer. [points [[Royal Magic Wand|wand]] at Rhombulus] Bubble Bubble Toil and Struggle. [the bugs and worms go away] Cold Shoulder Ice Storm. [unfreezes Rhombulus' shoulder] Poison Gas Manipulation. [gas flies into Star's face]
|-
!Star
|[coughing]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Sorry about that. And... Dreamless Sleep.
|-
!
|''The dark vortex is dispelled, and Rhombulus falls onto the floor. Star and Eclipsa stand over Rhombulus as he wakes up.''
|-
![[Rhombulus]]
|[groaning] Huh?
|-
!
|''Rhombulus' snakes are still stuck together.''
|-
!Snakes
|[muffled moaning]
|-
!Rhombulus
|Huh?! Eclipsa?! Aaah! [gets up, runs into a pole] Aaaaah! [runs into a wall, groans] You! You did this to me! You Rhomb-napped me!
|-
!Star
|Okay, and you gotta fix his hands.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Awww, that's my Ouroboros spell. I'm proud of that one.
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa...
|-
!Eclipsa
|Okay, fine. Ouroboros.
|-
!
|''Rhombulus' snake hands are released from each other.''
|-
!Snakes
|[gasping for air, panting]
|-
!Left Snake
|You're nuts, lady!
|-
!Eclipsa
|You have venom on your face.
|-
!Rhombulus
|[growling]
|-
!Star
|I think you owe him an apology.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Look, I'm sorry, Rhombulus. I didn't mean for things to get so out of hand.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Well, I'm sorry your monster husband is a [[Mewmans|Mewman]]-eatin' menace!
|-
!Star
|No, Rhombulus! Stop for one second! She's trying to apologize!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Exactly! I'm sorry that Rhombulus doesn't know how to use his inside voice! Globgor hasn't eaten a Mewman since before we started dating!
|-
!Star
|Yeah! Wait, what?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Once Globgor and I fell in love, he became a vegetarian just for me! He wouldn't eat a Mewman if he was starving and it came with a side of ranch!
|-
!Rhombulus
|A likely story.
|-
!Star
|Cool it, you two! [puts chair under Eclipsa] Eclipsa, it's fair that you would want your hubby back. [puts chair under Rhombulus] And Rhombulus, you and the rest of the [[Magic High Commission|Magical High Commission]] have your reasons for ''not'' wanting to free Globgor. But you both just gotta talk it out. You probably won't reach an agreement overnight. It might take years! But it is the grown-up thing to do. Now, are we all grown-ups here?
|-
!Eclipsa and Rhombulus
|Yes!
|-
!Star
|That's right. Oh, wait. Except ''I'm'' still a teenager, so I'm gonna go. [on phone] Hey, Marco! Strap Tom to that wagon, 'cause I am ready to hit the beach!
|-
!
|''A chair is thrown against the wall near Star.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!Rhombulus
|Mewman-eater! Mewman-eater!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Crystal-headed tyrant!
|-
!Star
|That's it! [turns phone off] Macaroon Melee Swarm!
|-
!
|''Star creates a ring of pink macaroons around Eclipsa.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Aah!
|-
!Star
|Mega Narwhal Blast!
|-
!
|''Star fires narwhals at Rhombulus. Rhombulus freezes a couple of them and hurls them at Eclipsa, pinning her hat and dress to the wall.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|I liked you better when you were sleeping! Spiral Hypnoslumber! [shoots magic beams at Rhombulus]
|-
!Rhombulus
|Nice try. [Hypnoslumber bounces off Rhombulus' face] Hypno spells bounce right off!
|-
!Star
|[gets hit by Spiral Hypnoslumber] Aaah!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, dear!
|-
!Star
|[snoring, starts sleepwalking]
|-
!Marco
|[enters wearing a towel] Hey, Star? Uh, Tom likes 'em, but I think Glossaryck's trunks are cutting off my circulation. [his legs are turning blue] Would your dad mind if I borrowed his loincloth?
|-
!Star
|[sleepwalks into a wall, snoring]
|-
!Marco
|Star! Wake up! [falls over] My legs! Ohhh! So tingly!
|-
!Tom
|Dude! You'll never guess where I found your swimsuit.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Aw, look what you did to Star!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Low Self-Esteem Nightmare Dream!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa shoots a coiling blast of magic at Rhombulus. Rhombulus ducks under it.''
|-
!Tom
|[holding [[Foolduke]]'s white monkey] Monkey stole 'em! [laughs]
|-
!
|''Tom gets hit by Low Self-Esteem Nightmare Dream. He drops the monkey, and it runs away.''
|-
!Tom
|[looking at his reflection] Is that... me? Am I wearing... make-up? I am! And... And boots?! I mean, w-what am I thinking? Marco, am I ridiculous?
|-
!Marco
|You look fine, dude.
|-
!Tom
|Oh, no. I have terrible taste in fashion ''and'' friends!
|-
!
|''Rhombulus fires his crystal lasers at Eclipsa. She frees herself from the wall and dodges the lasers.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|I won't miss again! Low Self-Esteem Nightmare Dream!
|-
!Rhombulus
|[gets hit with Nightmare Dream, whimpering] W-Wait a second. A-Are these ''my'' muscles? I'm not buff enough! I-I gotta work out!
|-
!
|''Marco crawls on the floor and tries to grab Star, but Rhombulus picks him up and starts using him for weightlifting.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|One, two, three...!
|-
!
|''Glossaryck laughs while eating popcorn, and the monkey tosses popcorn everywhere.''
|-
!Marco
|Star, wake up! [throws loincloth at Star]
|-
!Star
|[loincloth hits side of her head] Ugh! What happened? Aah! Loincloth?! What the heck is going on?!
|-
!
|''Rhombulus continues to weight-lift with Marco. Eclipsa is about to attack him again.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|Eighty, ninety...
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Supersonic Leech Bomb!
|-
!
|''Star scatters leech bombs around Eclipsa and Rhombulus' feet, and they beep intermittently.''
|-
!Eclipsa, Rhombulus, and Marco
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''Eclipsa and Rhombulus jump away as the bombs explode. Star catches Marco, and Rhombulus flies backward into Globgor's crystal.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|[groaning] Huh? [the crystal in his left nipple shatters] Oh, no! My other Crystal Nipple Demon! I still wasn't sure which one was evil.
|-
!Red demon
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''The tiny red demon that was trapped inside the crystal flees on the back of Foolduke's monkey. They leave the chamber, and screaming voices, whinnying horses, and loud crashing sounds are heard outside.''
|-
!Left Snake
|Pretty sure that was the good Nipple Demon.
|-
!Right Snake
|Yeah, I think we can let him go.
|-
!Star
|That's it! We can't have Nipple Demons running all over the place! Tom?!
|-
!Tom
|[sad] What?!
|-
!Star
|[gives Marco to Tom] Take this sweaty teen out of here.
|-
!Marco
|It's not my fault this swimsuit's too tight!
|-
!Star
|Mama's gotta deal with these babies. [to Rhombulus] Hey! No more!
|-
!Rhombulus
|What?! [his left nipple pops out]
|-
!Star
|Look, this thing is gettin' out of hand.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Why're you telling me? ''She's'' the evil one! I should just recrystallize her like her freak husband!
|-
!Star
|Dude, saying stuff like that is probably why this is happening!
|-
!Rhombulus
|She's the one who started it!
|-
!
|''Rhombulus' crystal face suddenly shimmers, and his snake arms fall to his sides.''
|-
!Star
|Uh, Rhombulus?
|-
!
|''Rhombulus falls unconscious while standing, and his body floats in midair. Eclipsa has her wand raised, and dark helixes spiral in her eyes. The wand parasol closes, and Eclipsa falls over unconscious.''
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa! [runs to her side] What was that?!
|-
!Rhombulus
|[in Eclipsa's body] Uh... Huh? What?! [looks at his hands]
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa?
|-
!Rhombulus
|[in Eclipsa's body] Uh... Uh... Why are there so many holes in my face?!
|-
!Right Snake
|[in Eclipsa's body] I don't like this!
|-
!Left Snake
|[in Eclipsa's body] Everything's so dark and cold!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa, in Rhombulus' body, wakes up. Her cheek marks glow on Rhombulus' face.''
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[in Rhombulus' body] Okay, j-j-just hold on! [uncontrollably shoots crystals out of her snake hands] Aah! Oof!
|-
!Star
|You have no idea what you're doing!
|-
!Eclipsa
|I can explaaaaaain!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa propels herself around the chamber by shooting crystals from her hands, creating a wall between herself and Star.''
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa, stop!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa propels backward into Globgor's crystal and falls over.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|[in Eclipsa's body] Oh, man, that had to hurt! [laughs]
|-
!Snakes]
|[in Eclipsa's body, laughing]
|-
!Star
|That was your body, you idiot. Eclipsa! What are you doing?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[in Rhombulus' body] I'm sorry, Star. There's no other way. [shoots crystal laser from forehead]
|-
!Star
|This is not the way to get what you want!
|-
!
|''Globgor starts to de-crystallize.''
|-
!Rhombulus and Snakes
|[in Eclipsa's body, gasp]
|-
!Star
|[hand glowing] You can't just take someone else's body like this! It's gross! Ugh! How is anyone supposed to trust you if you use spells like that?! How am ''I'' supposed to trust you?
|-
!
|''Eclipsa looks remorseful and powers down her forehead laser. Globgor stops de-crystallizing from his hair and right hand.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[in Rhombulus' body, sighs] You're right.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa gets rid of the crystal wall between her and Star. Her crystal face shimmers, she falls unconscious, and she regains consciousness in her own body.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|Huh?
|-
!Snakes
|Oh, my gosh! We're back! All right! [headbutt each other] Huh! What?!
|-
!Star
|Hey, Rhombulus. You okay?
|-
!Rhombulus
|Let's see. I was just violated by dark magic. What do you think?
|-
!Eclipsa
|I... I'm sorry, Rhombulus.
|-
!Rhombulus
|This isn't over, Mewman-eater! [walks away] Oh, I almost forgot. Hah! [recrystallizes Globgor's hair and right hand] He's never getting out of that crystal. [leaves]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Thank you, Star. I just wanted so badly for Globgor to be free. But you were right. The kingdom comes first. [leaves]
|-
!Star
|[sighs]
|-
!
|''Star goes back to her and Marco's room and sees Marco and Tom filling a pool with hot water.''
|-
!Star
|Whoa.
|-
!Marco
|I still think it's too warm.
|-
!Tom
|Nah, if it's boiling, it's just right. [sees Star] Dude.
|-
!Star
|W-What's... What's going on here? Is this... Is this what bro time is?
|-
!Tom
|What? No. While you were still with Eclipsa, we decided â€“ why not still have a Beach Day?
|-
!Star
|Aw, you guys! You didn't have to do this!
|-
!Marco
|We just wanted to do something to make your day better.
|-
!Monkey
|[chattering, whacking Marco with a long leaf]
|-
!Marco
|Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
|-
!Star
|[holding back tears]
|-
!Tom
|Star, are you okay?
|-
!Star
|[crying] Yeah, I'm okay. It's... It's... It's just so sweet!
|-
!Tom
|Awww! [hugs Star] Happy Beach Day, Star.
|-
!Star
|Hey, Marco, did you ever find that swimsuit?
|-
!Marco
|Uh, yeah, I did. It just looks better on somebody else.
|-
!
|''Foolduke's monkey, wearing Marco's swimsuit, shakes its butt in front of a mirror.''
|-
!Monkey
|[shrieking]
