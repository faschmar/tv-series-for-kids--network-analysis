|-
!Star and Marco
|[spit]
|-
!Marco
|Oh, man, the only thing cooler than these Love Sentence singing toothbrushes is the fact you got us tickets to see them tomorrow!
|-
!Star
|Duh. That's what friends are for! Plus, Love Sentence is like our thing.
|-
!Marco
|Aw, you would know. You're my best friend.
|-
!Star
|Good night, Marco.
|-
!Marco
|[leaves the bathroom]
|-
!Star
|[slyly] Sleep tight.

|-
!Marco
|[snoring]

|''Marco's phone buzzes, and he answers.''
|-
!Marco
|Hello?
|-
!Star
|Marco! Are you awake? I forgot to tell you, there's more.
|-
!Marco
|[phone buzzes again] Aw, wait. I'm getting a call from [[Jackie Lynn Thomas|Jackie]].
|-
!Star
|Yeah, you are!
|-
!Marco
|[answers other call] Hey, Jackie. Uh, is everything all right?
|-
!Jackie Lynn Thomas
|Dude, Love Sentence tickets? You're smoother than you let on, Marco Diaz.
|-
!Marco
|[chuckles nervously] What?
|-
!Jackie
|Ooh, gotta go. Gotta crush this ramp. See you tomorrow! [hangs up]
|-
!Marco
|Star! Did you get tickets for Jackie, too? ...Star! I know you're there.
|-
!Star
|[slowly rises up behind Marco's bed]
|-
!Marco
|Hello? Did you get Jackie tickets?
|-
!Star
|[pokes Marco] ''You'' did.
|-
!Marco
|[gasps]
|-
!Star
|Aren't you excited, Marco? You guys are a thing now! The three of us are gonna be hanging out a ''lot''. I don't want Jackie feeling left out 'cause I'm a supercool girl who's also your supercool best friend.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, you are. I'm just... I'm just worried that with you around, Jackie will realize I'm not as super-cool.
|-
!Star
|I've dated before. Trust me, you'll be fine.
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] Fine. Just let me sleep.
|-
!Star
|Yay! This is gonna be awesome! Now, get them beauty sleeps. [leaves Marco's room]

!Star
|Time to get dressed, Marco!
|-
!Marco
|[screams, falls over]
|-
!Star
|Come on! Come-on-come-on-come-on! Jackie's gonna be here any minute!
|-
!Marco
|I know. [puts his hood up] That's what I'm worried about.
|-
!Star
|Oh, poor thing. I told you, there's nothing to worry about, right? We just want to make Jackie feel included in our fun times together.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, I guess.
|-
!Star
|[picks Marco up off the floor] Come on, it'll be fine. I promise. Now get dressed! [skips away humming]
|-
!Marco
|Uh, I ''am'' dressed. Red hoodie. Jeans. That's pretty much dressed for me.
|-
!Star
|Hah. Uh, no, you're not, 'cause I made concert tees~!
|-
!
|''Star uses her [[Star Butterfly's wand|wand]] to make three concert tees, one of which materializes on her body.''
|-
!Marco
|Oh, man! Love Sentence concert tees! [gets tee thrown in his face]
|-
!Star
|Handcrafted.
|-
!
|''Marco's concert tee bears his, Star's, and Jackie's faces with the words "LS TOUR".

|[horror movie music sting]
|-
!Marco
|[sarcastic] Perfect.
|-
!Star
|I know, right? Put it on!
|-
!
|''Marco struggles to put the concert tee on.''
|-
!Marco
|[chuckles, straining] Little tight.
|-
!
|''The doorbell rings.''
|-
!Star
|Jackie's here!
|-
!Marco
|[panicked grunting]
|-
!Star
|[opens door] Hey, girlfriend!
|-
!Jackie
|No way! You made concert tees?
|-
!Star
|Oh, yeah. Check it out.
|-
!Jackie
|That's so funny, 'cause I made concert skateboards! Whoa! [holds up Love Sentence-themed skateboards]
|-
!Star
|No... way... I can't believe we had the same idea!
|-
!Jackie
|Great minds, am I right?
|-
!Star
|♪ Trade! ♪
|-
!
|''Star trades a concert tee for one of Jackie's skateboards. Jackie puts the tee on.''
|-
!Jackie
|So, where's Marco?
|-
!Star
|Oh, he's getting dressed.
|-
!Marco
|[still struggling to put on concert tee, straining, panting] Hey, Jackie.
|-
!Jackie
|[takes off helmet] Hey, Marco.
|-
!Marco
|[strains, pants]
|-
!
|''Marco finally puts the tee on, but it's way too small for him.''
|-
!Jackie
|Nice shirt. Shows off your pecs.
|-
!Marco
|[strained] Skateboards, really? I thought we were taking the bus.
|-
!Star
|[puts helmet on Marco's head] Yeah! Skateboards! It'll be fun! Summoning [[Cloudy]] Charm! [summons Cloudy]
|-
!Cloudy
|[excited scream]
|-
!Star
|[riding skateboard on top of Cloudy] Love Sentence, here we come!
|-
!Cloudy

|-
!Star
|Whoo!
|-
!Marco
|[sighs]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Star and Jackie riding to the concert.''
|-
!Star
|Ooh-ooh! I got one. How many times did Love Sentence break up before their fourth reunion tour?
|-
!Jackie
|Uh... Six, if you count the time they broke up on the morning of their second reunion tour and got back together after lunch.
|-
!Star
|Yes! Except it was ''before'' lunch, not after.
|-
!Jackie
|No, it was totally after.
|-
!Star
|Let's ask Marco.
|-
!Jackie
|Yeah, where is Marco?
|-
!Marco
|[skating slowly, wheezing] Right... behind... you!
|-
!Jackie
|Wow... Maybe we should've taken the bus.
|-
!Marco
|[wheezing] No! Can we just get to the concert?
|-
!
|''Marco skates ahead of Star and Jackie and crosses a family of ducks.''
|-
!Mother Duck
|[honking]
|-
!Marco
|[girly screaming]
|-
!
|''The duck and her ducklings sail through the air. Marco sails through the air.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah! [thud] 
|-
!Ducklings
|[chirping]

!
|''Marco's concert tee tears in half down the middle. Scene cuts to veterinarian's office.''
|-
!Veterinarian
|The ducks will be fine.
|-
!Mother Duck
|[honks]
|-
!Veterinarian
|Marco should be fine, too, provided he take some skateboard lessons. The skateboard didn't make it. [hands Marco a medical bill] Your bill.
|-
!Marco
|650 dollars?! Aw!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the city riverbed; Star slides to the bottom while holding the box of ducks.''
|-
!Star
|Come on!
|-
!Jackie
|[skates to bottom of riverbed]
|-
!Marco
|[slides to bottom of riverbed on his stomach]
|-
!Star
|Aw, they are so cute!
|-
!Mother Duck
|[honks]
|-
!Jackie
|Little disease-ridden angels.
|-
!Marco
|I want to help! Let me help! Quack-quack!
|-
!Ducklings
|[alarmed chirping]
|-
!Star
|Marco, you're scaring them!
|-
!Marco
|[walks away]
|-
!Star
|It's okay, little babies. He's gone.
|-
!Marco
|Aw...
|-
!Star
|Calm down. We're at your new home.
|-
!Duckling
|[chirps]
|-
!Jackie
|Aw, come on, little dudes, don't be nervous.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, this place is great! I used to live here.
|-
!Jackie
|Me, too. Wait, what?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, for, like, a day. But you guys will make friends so quick! There's [[Brigid|the lady that steals hair]] who lives over there.
|-
!Jackie
|[laughs] Really?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, she smells like shampoo all the time. It's crazy.
|-
!Jackie
|[laughing] No way that's true.
|-
!Star
|Seriously, it is! And around there is where I met the dragon. I think. Oh, oh, oh. And there's a really good taco place around here.
|-
!Jackie
|Star, dude.
|-
!Star
|Oh. Time to say bye!
|-
!Mother Duck
|[honks]
|-
!Ducklings
|[chirping, jump into water]
|-
!Star
|Marco, come say bye!
|-
!
|''Marco sits on a milk crate under the overpass with his head down. Jackie walks over to him.''
|-
!Star
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Marco holds his ripped concert tee; the rip goes through the picture of his face. He pushes the left and right sides together, placing Star and Jackie's faces next to each other.''
|-
!Jackie
|Marco, dude. Are you okay?
|-
!Marco
|You and Star should just go on without me. You'll have more fun. I'll just be here ruining things, breaking skateboards, ripping shirts, and traumatizing families of ducks.
|-
!Mother Duck
|[honks angrily, chases Marco]
|-
!Marco
|Aah! [hides behind Jackie]
|-
!Jackie
|[pats duck on the head] Dude. [pats Marco on the head] Dude. Don't worry about the skateboard. My uncle works for the company, and I'm... I'm having fun with you, but... these guys deserve an apology.
|-
!Marco
|I'm s—
|-
!Jackie
|I'm kidding, Marco, but that was really sweet.
|-
!
|''The mother duck and her ducklings return to the water and swim away. Star appears between Jackie and Marco and puts her arms around them.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, ''we'' should be apologizing! Me and Jackie were having so much fun, you probably felt left out. But you shouldn't.
|-
!Jackie
|Yeah, we wouldn't have met those cute ducks if it weren't for you.
|-
!Star
|And that was magical!
|-
!Marco
|Heh. They were cute.
|-
!Star
|The idea was we go together.
|-
!Jackie
|Yeah, Marco, come on. Let's go have fun.
