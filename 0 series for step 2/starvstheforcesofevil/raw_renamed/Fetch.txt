|''The scene opens in the park with Marco trying to stick a straw into a juice box.''
|-
!'''[[Marco Diaz]]'''
| Okay Diaz, you got this. Aim it at the little... [the straw becomes scrunched, angry muttering] All right, going again. [laser puppy jumps on juice box] Hey, this is hard enough already. Star, can you please get control of these puppies? I'm trying to focus.
|-
!'''[[Star Butterfly]]'''
| Oh yeah yeah yeah, no problem. Totally. Come on guys. I believe in you, Marco.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Star, I'm concentrating.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Right, right, right, right, right. Okay, I'll be quiet. Even if no one else does... I believe.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Got it. I'm trying to focus. [mirror rings] Ugh. Just answer it please.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Ugh. [opens mirror] Hey mom.
|-
!'''[[Queen Butterfly|Queen]]'''
| Star, your Aunt Felicity still hasn't received her thank-you card for the lovely necklace she sent you.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Grr, just give me the juice!
|-
!'''Star'''
| Yeah, I can't right now Mom. Things are happening.
|-
!'''Queen'''
| You said that the last time...
|-
!'''Star'''
|[closes mirror] Marco, did you free the nectar from the juice cocoon?
|-
!
|''The puppies start shooting lasers.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Get the puppies out of the way.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh, stop it puppies. Here [grabs her wand], go fetch [throws it]. Oh no!
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Did you just throw your wand?
|-
!'''Star'''
| I threw my wand. The poo-poo bin! No, no, no! [bounces off the trash can into a bush] Oh, thank Mewni. Saved by the bush. [wand is pulled into bush] What? [reaches for it] Got it. [pulls out dog holding wand in mouth, screams] Oh, you're just a doggie. For a second, I thought you were a gargoyle. Thank you for bringing me my wand [touches the wand].

|-
!'''Dog'''

|-
!'''Star'''
| All right dude, this is annoying. Is your person here somewhere?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| There's no one else in the park, Star. Everyone always leaves when we get here... for some reason [pulls out fire extinguisher to quench a fire]. The laser puppies are hungry. Just grab your wand. Let's go.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Hmm.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the Diaz's house, sometime later. Star holds the dog, which still has the wand in its mouth. She taps its muzzle to a coat rack.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Star, what are you doing? That's a dog, not a coat.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Fur coat.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| No. Look, you're basically a pet owner now; you're gonna have to feed him. He'll put the wand down if he wants to eat.
|-
!'''Dog'''
| [eats food with wand in mouth, walks into the bathroom]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Okay.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Is that normal?
|-
!'''Dog'''
| [flushes toilet, uses sink, leaves bathroom]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Sorry, this is your problem. I'm gonna go to bed. Come on puppies. [goes upstairs with laser puppies]
|-
!'''Star'''
| [to dog] Hi. So it's bedtime now, and I sleep best with my wand right under my pillow, even though my mom says not to because of [yawns] radiation [falls asleep with dog].
|-
!'''Dog'''
| [growls]
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to Marco's room. Marco is asleep with the laser puppies, but the new dog is staring at him.''
|-
!
|''The next morning, Marco wakes up and walks down the stairs.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Star, you down here?
|-
!'''Star'''
| [wakes up, the dog beside her] What?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [screams] Star, come on. We gotta get going; we're gonna be late for school.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [groans] Okay, okay. Just give me a sec [reaches for wand]
|-
!'''Dog'''

|-
!'''Star'''
| What?!
|-
!'''Principal'''
| Where are you going with that dog?
|-
!'''Star'''
| he's got my wand.
|-
!'''Principal'''
| A dog in a classroom is a roadblock to learning. Do not come back until you get rid of that dog.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Ugh.
|-
!'''[[Jackie Lynn Thomas|Jackie]]'''
| Cool hat Star Butterfly
|-
!'''Star'''
| Shut up.
|-

|''Scene changes to later at the Stop and Slurp. Star is on a call with her mom.''
|-
!'''Queen'''
| Star, you have to send your aunt a thank-you card. It's a really nice necklace.
|-
!'''Star'''
| I can't talk right now Mom, I just got kicked out of school.
|-
!'''Queen'''
| What?
|-
!'''Star'''
| [hangs up]
|-
!'''Cashier'''
| Uh, no dogs in the store. [no response] Sure. Ignore me. I'm not like a person with feelings. Or anything.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [puts down a slurpee]
|-
!'''Cashier'''
| That'll be a buck fifty.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh, I can't make any money right now 'cause my dog has my wand.
|-
!'''Dog'''
| [growls]
|-
!'''Star'''
| See?
|-
!'''Cashier'''
| Right. On your tab then?
|-
!'''Star'''
| Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Marco Diaz. Cool. Thanks Joe.
|-
!'''Cashier'''
| Name's not Joe.
|-
!'''Star'''
| And my name's not Marco. [sees a lost dog poster, gasps] Lost dog!
|-
!
|''Poster slides away due to it being on an automatic sliding door''
|-
!'''Star'''
| What? Come back.
|-
!
|''Door continues to open and closes''
|-
!'''Cashier'''
| Please stop that.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Sorry [giggles, grabs poster]. "Lost smallish medium-to-large dog." You're a smallish medium-to-large dog. "Dog-ish face." Yep, dog-ish face. "May or may not bark" [holds hand to dog]
|-
!'''Dog'''
| [growls]
|-
!'''Star'''
| You may or may not bark! I'm pretty sure this flyer is talking bout you, mister. "Call 555-0199." Okay, 555-0199.
|-
!
|''A phone rings inside the store.''
|-
!'''Cashier'''
| Hello. Thank you for calling...
|-
!'''Star'''
| Hi. I got your flyer and I think I found your dog.
|-
!'''Cashier'''
| I do not have any pets.
|-
!'''[[Lydia]]'''
| [to cashier through a window] Tee! Is someone calling about the dog?
|-
!'''Cashier'''
| Uh, yeah.
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| It's for me. [grabs phone] Hello. This is Lydia.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Hi. I found your dog. I am outside the Stop and Slurp.
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| Be right there.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Okay, bye.
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| [walks around corner to Star] Hiiii.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Hi. Here for this little gargoyle? I found him. Here you go.
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| Come to Mommy, my little, um... Willow...bee.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Right, okay. Can you get Willoughby to drop my wand?
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| I... I can do that. Willoughby, put it down. Where are you going?
|-
!
|''Willoughby walks into the restroom and uses the toilet.''
|-
!'''Star'''
| It's, uh, cool you taught your dog to use the bathroom.
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| Yeah [nervous giggle]
|-
!'''Star'''
| That's not your dog, is it?
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| [nervous giggle]
|-
!
|''The dog leaves the bathroom, Star picks him up and runs.''
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| But I have... so much love to give.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to Marco at his home. He is talking to one of the laser puppies, with his juice box in hand. ''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Stand up.
|-
!'''Puppy'''
| [stands]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Bark.
|-
!'''Puppy'''
| [barks]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Now play pirate.
|-
!'''Puppy'''
| [squints left eye shut]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Now laser the hole.
|-
!
|''The dog shoots a laser into Marco's eye.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [shrieks, his eye starts emitting red light] Okay, everything is half red.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [walks in]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Star, where have you been?
|-
!'''Star'''
| I don't wanna talk about it.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Okay.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Today was the worst day ever Marco. I got sent home from school, I couldn't make any money so I had to put everything on your tab.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| What?
|-
!'''Star'''
| I was harassed by a weird lady, and worst of all, Willoughby still won't give me back my wand [groans].
|-
!'''Marco'''
| His name's Willoughby?
|-
!'''Star'''
| That's what the weird lady called him. I thought I found his owner, but she was just a fake.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Yeah, this flyer's obviously fake, but let's go back to the dog park and see if his real owner put up a flyer.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [sighs] Okay. You know your eye is glowing, right?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| I know.
|-
!
|''Scene transitions to Marco and Star at the park. ''
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Hmm, nope.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [holding Willoughby like a metal detector] Beep, beep, beep. Where's your owner?
|-
!'''Lady 1'''
| My problem is, I'm stuck in a doubt loop.
|-
!'''Lady 2'''
| You so are.
|-
!
|''Star jumps on the ladies' table, holds Willoughby to the second's face, and beeps rapidly. she holds it over the first's and buzzes. ''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Mm-mm [walks back to Marco] Come on, Willoughby.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [trying to open the juice box]Why is this so hard?
|-
!'''Star'''
| I know, right?
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Oh, right. Your thing is hard too.
|-
!'''Star'''
| [frowns, groans]
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| [Ears rustle rapidly]
|-
!'''Star'''
| Willoughby senses something. [gasps as a man approaches] Marco, look. Beautiful businessman. Go Willoughby. Go to your businessman.
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| [runs towards businessman]
|-
!'''Star'''
| [gasps]
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| [stops, runs towards outhouse]
|-
!'''Star'''
| [burst in to outhouse] that's it! What the...
|-
!
|''Willoughby looks in the mirror, waving the wand with his hand. ''
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| [hands Star the wand, in a female voice] Sorry.
|-
!'''Star'''
| What just happened?
|-
!
|''They leave the outhouse''
|-
!'''Star'''
| Who are you?
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| It doesn't matter.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Why did you take my wand?
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| [sigh] Because in my dimension, dogs are the ones with all the problems. There's no escape. [grabs Marco's juice box] Only sadness. [pokes the straw in] It's easier if you poke it from the bottom.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| You did it. [sips] White grape.
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| All I really want is to be... like them [gestures at the laser puppies]. I thought if I zapped myself with your wand, I could quiet my troubled mind.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [sipping]
|-
!'''Star'''
| But you can't just run away from all you're problems.
|-
!'''Marco'''
| [chokes] You run away from your problems all the time.
|-
!'''Star'''
| No, I just take breaks.
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| That's what I want. I want a break.
|-
!'''Star'''
| You don't need magic for that. You need a chew toy [creates a bone shaped toy]. And you need to play fetch [lifts up her wand].
|-
!'''Marco'''
| No, Star! No fetch.
|-
!'''Star'''
| He. Oh yeah. And you need a Marco too. [calls Lydia with mirror] Hey Lydia, I found your dog. Again.
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| [jumps out of a bush] I've been here all along. Come here, my sweet little boy.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Actually, he's a girl.
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| It doesn't matter. My little cake pop. It's time to come home.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Go on.
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| I guess it couldn't hurt.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Wait. There's one more thing [gives her necklace to Willoughby].
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| Your necklace? I couldn't.
|-
!'''Star'''
| Eh, it's a win-win. This way, I don't have to send my Aunt Felicity a thank you card. [baby talk] Now go get your Lydia.
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| Uh, why are you talking to me like that?
|-
!'''Star'''
| [baby talk] 'Cause that's how we talk to wittle doggies [pushes Willoughby to Lydia]
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| [picks up Willoughby] This is what happiness feels like.
|-
!'''Willoughby'''
| [pants]
|-
!'''Lydia'''
| Thank you for finding my dog. Bye [runs away]
|-
!'''Star'''
| See, Marco? I do face my problems [mirror buzzes]
|-
!'''Marco'''
| Is that your mom calling again?
|-
!'''Star'''
| [shoves him] Break!
