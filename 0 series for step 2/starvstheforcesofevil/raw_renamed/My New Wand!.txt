|My towel!
|-
!'''Star'''
|Hang on. I'll get you out.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. I'm not decent.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Oh, okay.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Don't open that.
|-
!'''Star '''
|Wasn't gonna.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Uh, it's locked.
|-
!'''Star'''
|What⁈
|-
!
|''Star pulls on door knob with both hands''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Try the knob.
|-
!'''Star'''
|What do you think I am doing?
|-
!
|''Laser puppies enter room''
|-
!'''Star'''
|No, no, not now, sweetie. [grunts] I usually open this door with my wand.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Well, your book ate it.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Better not be pokin' around in there. That's my secrets closet. It's private.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Just get me outta here.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[struggles to pull door open]
|-
!'''[[Glossaryck]]'''
|What are you doing?
|-
!'''Star'''
|[screams] Uh, hey, Glossaryck. My wand's locked in the closet.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Hey, what about me?
|-
!'''Star'''
|Oh, yeah. Marco's in there too. And my spell book. Basically all my stuff. I want my stuff.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Did you try the knob?
|-
!'''Star'''
|I tried the knob.
|-
!
|''Star swings at door with a large sword''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Anything?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Nope. Still locked.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Aha! What's going on? Is this some kind of training thing or something?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Are you some kind of training thing? Are you mad? Is this wolf-babob rock bandage ba ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba...
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Stop, stop. Stop it! Just tell me how to get out of here.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Okay. I'll tell you what to do. Are you listening?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[sighs] Yes, I'm listening.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|To reach the chunks in the hobo stew, find her secret. That's the clue.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|So if I find her secret, the door's just gonna magically open?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Goodbye!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Secret? [looks at a mountainous pile of secrets] Which one? Here we got
|-
!
|''Star stabs the door with her sword''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Why don't you try the easy way and open the door with magic?
|-
!'''Star'''
|I can't do magic. My wand's in the closet.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|[gasps, pupils dilating] Do you wanna try the hard way?
|-
!'''Star '''
|[pupils dilating] Yeah! What's the hard way?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|You've never heard of the hard way?
|-
!'''Star'''
|Nope. Sounds hard though.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Oh, it is. But I can teach you.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Teach me.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|The lesson begins inside my eyeball.
|-
!
|''Camera pans to inside Glossaryck's eye. He and Star sit round a bubbling cauldron.''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Imagine the universe as this big old cauldron, and magic is the bubbly stew inside, and your wand is the spoon. And now...
|-
!'''Star'''
|[interrupting] My wand isn't a spoon. It's a wand.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|It's a metaphor, Star.
|-
!'''Star'''
|No, it's a wand.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Fine. It's a wand.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[clapping] Now you're getting it.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Now the wand can only skim the surface of the hobo gravy, watery and brown. But if you want to get to the chunks, you've got to dip down.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck extends his hands into the stew and lifts out a pile of mush from within it.''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Get it?
|-
!'''Star '''
|[nods, then shakes her head] Uh-uh.
|-
!
|''Cauldron disappears in a poof. The pair is now back in Star's room.''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Okay, look. You can do magic without your wand. You just have to dip down, ya know? Dip down. Dip down!
|-
!'''Star'''
|Without my wand?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|[shrugs] Your mom did it.
|-
!'''Star'''
|psh! If she can do it, I can do it. Okay, I've just gotta dip down. [picks up laser puppy and shoots door with laser]
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Hot laser!
|-
!
|''Glossaryck lifts up his hand. A hole has been burned in it.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|I am so sorry.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Star, try dipping downer for the chunks.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck enters the closet through the door's key hole and opens up the spell book''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Ow!
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Ah, Marco my boy. How's it going over there?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Oh, you know, just trying to find her "secret" in a closet full of secrets!
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Yes, well, you know I do this because I love you.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Okay, that's a little weird.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Ha ha. I'm sure it is. Now if you don't mind [gestures to wand], I've got work to do.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Yeah. So do I [opens a treasure box]
|-
!'''Strange Fish Thing '''
|Help... me!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[screams]
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Hmm [looks at wand]
|-
!
|''Star sits outside the closet, looking at the door. Her laser puppy pants.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|You ever dip down before, Sajak?
|-
!'''[[Laser puppies|Sajak]]'''
|[continues to pant]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Yeah, me neither.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to inside the closet.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|What a mess. It's time to get organized.
|-
!
|''Marco places two signs on the floor, one labeled "No secrets" the other "Secrets?" He walks over to the pile of stuff and starts sifting through it.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|No... No!
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Star. She is in her room pacing.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Dip down, dip down, dip down, dip down. Dip down, dip down, dip down, dip down. DIP DOWN! DOWN!! [stares at fish]
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to outside the closet. Star takes the pufferfish with a few rocks and throws them at the closet door''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Aquarium blast! [picks up just the fish] Fish blast. [looks at fish] Are you okay?
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Glossaryck''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Hmm.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Star, back in her room''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Dip down. [falls face first on bed, crawls under the covers] Dip down. [pulls out a box underneath the bed labeled 'Mewnian Termytes' and smiles]
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Marco. He wheels around the closet on a unicycle''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Nope.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to Star. She releases the Mewnian Termytes into the closet through the door boards.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[screams] They're biting me!
|-
!'''Star'''
|That didn't work.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Stop eating my flesh.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Glossaryck''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| [looks at wand] Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmmmmm.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Star in her room.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|[exhales] Ahem. Call Mom.
|-
!'''Mirror'''
|Calling Mom
|-
!'''[[Queen Butterfly]]'''
|Star?
|-
!'''Star'''
|Hi Mommy.
|-
!'''Queen'''
|What did you do?
|-
!'''Star'''
|[stammering] oh, wha, why would you, ha, that is [sighs] Okay, Marco's locked in my closet and Glossaryck wants me to dip down to get him out.
|-
!'''Queen'''
|Dip down? I didn't learn that until I was 19.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Wow! Wow. So I'm, like, advanced [chuckles]
|-
!'''Queen'''
|I suppose.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Anyway, Glossaryck didn't really give me any instructions, so...
|-
!'''Queen'''
|Ha. That sounds familiar. Well, it's not easy. If you want to dip down, you have to summon everything you have.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Everything⁈ Oh! Everything.
|-
!'''Queen'''
|Star, you do know what I mean by everything...
|-
!'''Star'''
|Yeah, totally, totally [ends call]
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Marco''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Okay, I think that's everything.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Star. She has loaded all the items in her room into a giant catapult aimed at the closet door.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|[grunts, ties the catapult's rope down] You want everything? Everything you shall get [holds sword ready to swing]
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Marco Diaz makin' progress.
|-
!
|[''crashing noise, all the piles fall on top of Marco]''
|-
!
|''Glossaryck peaks inside Star's wand, looking at the Millhorse on the treadmill who screams.''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Okay, that's not good.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Star''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Well, Marco, looks like I'm just a skimmer. Skimmin' the surface of the hobo gravy. The watery hobo gravy. How are things goin' for you?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[from inside the closet] Not so good. Actually, you thwarted my progress.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[sigh] I guess it's not that bad. I can slide sandwiches under the door. Bring you your homework. Life could be good for you.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|I don't wanna live in your secrets closet. [spell book glows]. Whoa! [holds it up, yells, drops it, grabs Glossaryck] Alright. No more riddles, little man. Tell me what I'm supposed to be looking for [pokes Glossaryck, activating a flashlight] Ow. My eyes! [a book falls in front of Marco] Oh! So this is the thing.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Bingo.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Star, I found the thing. It's a little book.
|-
!'''Star'''
|That's good. Reading will keep the mind sharp. Like a horn.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|It's in Mewnian writing. Oh, wait, here's English. "Chapter one. Mom's a poop head."
|-
!'''Star'''
|Mom's a poop head? [gasps] Marco, no. No, no, no,no, no!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Hang on Star. Just give me a sec.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Marco, no. That's not the thing. That's not the thing!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Skipping forward.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Marco, put that down!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|"On my tenth birthday, I put noxie forgs in all the servants's beds." [Glossaryck's light goes out] Hey.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|I'm out of juice. Dip down [dives into spell book]
|-
!'''Star'''
|[banging on closet door] Marco, it's not the thing, it's not the thing!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[reading by light from the door] "Chapter 11, my thoughts on... Marco."
|-
!'''Star'''
|[gasps] Dip down. [she turns blue, fills with magical energy, levitating off the floor, and successfully opens the lock]
|-
!
|''Marco crashes to the floor, still reading. Star blinks twice.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|I did it! I dipped, I dipped, I dipped, Marco! I'm not a skimmer. I dipped! [grabs the diary from his hands and smacks him with it]
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Ow!
|-
!'''Star'''
|Sorry. But don't read my journal.
|-
!
|''Spell books rolls out of the closet, opens to reveal Glossaryck and Star's wand''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|Well, this thing's broken, but give it a whirl.
|-
!
|''Star blasts a hole in the roof, and a small tower appears.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Uh...
|-
!'''Marco'''
|I'm gonna go put on some pants.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Uh...
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
|[coughs] I call dibs on the new tower.
