|''Episode begins with [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]] applying lipstick while looking at a mirror.''
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|Coo. Coo.
|-
!Archibald
|[holding "Pigeon Made Easy" book] Coo ''coo'' coo.
|-
![[Meteora Butterfly]]
|[shakes her rattle] Coo-coo!
|-
!All
|[cooing]
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
|[enters room] Is... Is this a bad time?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, [[Janna Ordonia|Janna]]! [chuckles] You'll have to pardon me. I'm just brushing up on my pigeon for the dinner party tonight with the rich pigeons. Thank you for offering to babysit.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa puts Meteora in her baby crib.''
|-
!Meteora
|[baby talk]
|-
!Janna
|Hey, anything for the Queen of Darkness.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I would've asked [[Marco Diaz|M-A-R-C-O]], but I get the sense she doesn't like him very much.
|-
!Janna
|Yeah, who can blame her? [to Meteora] Marco!
|-
!Meteora
|[hisses]
|-
!Janna
|[chuckles] Exactly.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Ooh. She really does take after her father, doesn't she? [kisses Meteora's forehead] You be good, my darling. I'll be back by 8:00. [leaves]
|-
!Janna
|If you're not, I charge double for overtime!
|-
!
|''The door closes.''
|-
!Janna
|Well, let the babysitting begin. [starts playing mobile game]
|-
!Meteora
|[giggles, shakes her rattle, turns her head 360 degrees]
|-
![[Glossaryck]]
|(''o.s.'') Psst! Meteora.
|-
!Meteora
|Huh?
|-
!Glossaryck
|(''o.s.'') Down here!
|-
!
|''Meteora looks down to see [[Glossaryck]] at the foot of her crib. He's wearing a leaf hat, and his right arm is in a cast.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Hello, Princess.
|-
!Meteora
|[exclaims, claps]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, geez. You would not believe the day I've had today.
|-
!Meteora
|[baby talk, points at Glossaryck's cast]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah. My arm. Just a little boo-boo. Nothing to really worry about.
|-
!Meteora
|[crying]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, no-no-no. Don't cry. Your buddy Glossaryck's okay. Look. Look. I've got another arm. Plus, I've got a silly hat.
|-
!Meteora
|[baby talk]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Now, as your guide to all magical matters, are you ready to continue our lessons?
|-
!Meteora
|[exclaims, claps]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Have you been practicing the "dip down" exercises I taught you?
|-
!Meteora
|Dee-daa!
|-
!Glossaryck
|No, no. A little longer and a little louder.
|-
!Meteora
|Di-i-i-i-i-i...
|-
!Glossaryck
|No-no-no-no. That... T-That's all wrong. It's just "dip down". Two short words.
|-
!Meteora
|[louder] Di-i-i-i-i-i...! [sweating]
|-
!Glossaryck
|No. N-N-Now you're just getting louder. No, no. No, no, no, no, no!
|-
!
|''Meteora grabs Glossaryck and sucks on his forehead gem.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|I know how much joy this brings you. Let's get going.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck opens a [[dimensional portal]] with his foot. Meteora tosses Glossaryck aside and goes through it.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Wait. Wait! Don't go in there without me. [follows Meteora through the portal]
|-
!Janna
|[still playing mobile game] Shh-shh-shh. There, there. [rocks Meteora's crib with her foot] Oh! Triple burger bonus! Yes!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the [[Plains of Time]] [[dimension]].''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Welcome... to the Plains of Time. To complete your lesson, we got to go back in time. And we need [[Father Time]] for that.
|-
!Meteora
|[turns her head 180 degrees, baby talk]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, yes. Yes, yes. I can go back in time. But I can't take a passenger with me. That's why we need Father Time. Where is he?
|-
!
|''Glossaryck uses his eyes like binoculars to look across the landscape. Meteora grabs a flying clock with her tongue and eats it.''
|-
!Meteora
|[baby talk]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Yes, of course I knew he wasn't going to be here. If he was here, it would've been easy, and you wouldn't learn anything.
|-
!Meteora
|[baby talk]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Um... Sure, there's another way to time travel. I just, uh... [covers his face with his hands] I really don't want to see [[Reynaldo the Bald Pate|Reynaldo]] today.
|-
!Meteora
|[baby talk]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Reynaldo the Bald Pate? Ferryman of the River of Time?
|-
!
|''Glossaryck points to a subway-like staircase leading underground.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|[groans] Okay. Let's just get it over with. [leads Meteora down the stairs] Look, look, he's gonna talk and stuff. Uh, just... don't interact, okay?
|-
!
|''Underground, Glossaryck and Meteora stand in front of the River of Time.''
|-
!Meteora
|[exclaims]
|-
!Glossaryck
|All right, Meteora, pull up a seat.
|-
!Meteora
|[sits down]
|-
!Glossaryck
|This might take a while. Sometimes—
|-
!
|''Glossaryck is cut off by a blinding light off-screen.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|[cries out] You know what?! Never mind! He's here!
|-
!
|''Reynaldo the Bald Pate appears on a gondola with a figurehead shaped like his own head.''
|-
![[Reynaldo the Bald Pate]]
|For passage through my timely sea, this question you must answer me. Who speaks in rhyme and wanders time with none to call his family? No phone calls, cards, or—
|-
!Glossaryck
|Thank you, Reynaldo! Please be quiet. Just... We're in a hurry, and we need to get going. [carries Meteora onto the gondola]
|-
!Reynaldo
|What doth bring you to my land? A passage through time, swift and grand?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Ah-bup-bup-bup! We don't have time for riddles today. Princess Meteora and I need to go back.
|-
!Reynaldo
|An inch, a pinch, the years unravel. How far dost thou wish to travel? The length of something short and flat, or perhaps something—?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Ah-bup-bup-bup! We just need to go... to the Age of Butterflies.
|-
!Reynaldo
|With haste, we must depart this place and skim the flow of time and space. Away we go and briskly float. We ride, us three, upon a...
|-
!Glossaryck
|...Boat.
|-
!Reynaldo
|[whispers] And boom goes the dynamite.
|-
!Glossaryck
|At this point, I don't even know what you're getting out of this.
|-
!Reynaldo
|[rowing gondola] What's dank and musky like a foot and falls apart when overcooked? In soups and stews this foulness lingers. If you must touch, don't smell your fingers.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Meteora, I really must apologize. Father Time's wheel would've been so much faster and less... Reynaldo.
|-
!Meteora
|[chews on Glossaryck's mustache]
|-
!Glossaryck
|But why don't you practice your "dip down" while we're waiting?
|-
!Meteora
|Dee-daa! [falls backward, exclaims] Dee-daa! Dee-daa!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Okay, that's good. But try it with more emotion.
|-
!Meteora
|[exclaims]
|-
!Glossaryck
|A-All right. You're getting closer.
|-
!Reynaldo
|I can fill a room or just one heart. I cannot be shared, only apart. What am I?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Loneliness. Ah. You want to get back on the [[Magic High Commission|Magical High Commission]].
|-
!Reynaldo
|[whinnies, nods his head]
|-
!Glossaryck
|I don't think so, Reynaldo. The riddle thing, it's... [sighs] Look. Just because I created the Commission doesn't mean they listen to me.
|-
!Reynaldo
|[sighs] You have arrived at the time you seek.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Okay, great. Thank you! Come on. Let's go, Meteora. [carries Meteora away]
|-
!Reynaldo
|Bye... Dad.
|-
!
|''The staircase leading to the River of Time rises out of the ground in a forest, and Glossaryck carries Meteora out.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|[groans] Oh, my goodness. They keep you well fed, don't they? All right. Are you ready for your lesson? 'Cause we're here— Oh, no.
|-
!
|''A sea of gold water is seen, with multiple alligators in it. At the shore, several [[Mewmans]] are seen standing in a boat, covered in gold water.''
|-
![[Mewmans]]
|[shuddering]
|-
!Man 1
|W-Where are we?
|-
!Woman
|''Who'' are we?
|-
!Glossaryck
|[groans] Reynaldo brought us back too far. Let's go, Meteora.
|-
!Man 2
|Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Do you... Do you know who we are?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Uh... yes.
|-
!Man 2
|Can you help us?
|-
!Glossaryck
|[groans] Fine. Let's just do the abbreviated version here.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck takes the Mewnipendence Day pop-up book out of Meteora's pajamas.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|[opens book] A long time ago arrived the first settlers of [[Mewni]]. That's you.
|-
!Mewmans
|Wow...
|-
!Glossaryck
|A modest people with noble pursuits – life, liberty, and... corn. The end. [closes book, starts floating away] Oh. O-One more thing. [to Meteora] Mind if I borrow your rattle?
|-
!
|''Glossaryck takes Meteora's rattle and scoops a sphere of magic out of the water. A [[millhorse]] appears inside the sphere.''
|-
![[Millhorse]] 
|[yawns]
|-
!
|''Glossaryck puts the millhorse inside the rattle and closes it.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Eenie, meenie, Mewni, moe... Okay, you, Moe. Here you go.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck tosses the rattle into the hands of the Mewman woman in the middle.''
|-
!Woman
|Ah...
|-
!
|''The rattle transforms into the [[Royal Magic Wand]].''
|-
!Man 1
|Ooh!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Congratulations! You can do magic with that thing.
|-
!Woman
|Okay.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Come on, Meteora. We've got to hitch another ride with my weird son. [to Mewmans] Oh, and another one more thing! There's a storm coming! So y'all might want to huddle around that stump!
|-
!
|''The Mewmans look at the giant stump nearby as thunder crashes in the sky. Scene cuts back to Reynaldo in his gondola.''
|-
!Reynaldo
|Through darkness, slumbers, toils, solemnly alone. No game of catch, no father, no home.
|-
!Glossaryck
|[enters behind Reynaldo] Hey, Reynaldo?
|-
!Reynaldo
|Father!
|-
!Glossaryck
|Yeah. Can we just go forward in time a bit? Thanks.
|-
!Reynaldo
|Thou makest haste like wind, we shall arrive and—
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, geez, just go. Just go!
|-
!
|''The staircase pops out of the ground again, and Glossaryck and Meteora emerge.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|[sighs] Here's a free extra lesson for you – don't have children. [chuckles] Oh, it looks like we're here.
|-
!
|''A group of Septarians is gathered. In the middle, young [[Rasticore]] nervously holds out his arm inside the open mouth of another Septarian and closes his eyes.''
|-
![[Rasticore]]
|Boss, is this really necessary?
|-
!
|''Young [[Toffee]] appears with long hair and a spiked jacket.''
|-
![[Toffee]]
|Rasticore, if you're too weak for this, you'll never survive against a Mewman. Do it.
|-
!
|''The Septarian with his mouth open bites off Rasticore's arm.''
|-
!Rasticore
|[screams] It's kinda tingly.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Great. On to the last part of your lesson.
|-
!
|''Rasticore's arm slowly grows back.''
|-
!Toffee
|Now, they may have magic, but we are invincible.
|-
!Glossaryck
|(''o.s.'') Hey, Toffee!
|-
!Toffee
|Who said that? [turns around and sees Glossaryck and Meteora] Oh. Hello again.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Sorry for interrupting your weird meeting, but I'm trying to teach this little girl a lesson.
|-
!Toffee
|What are you trying to teach her? How to get your arm broken?
|-
!Septarians
|[laughing]
|-
!Meteora
|[baby talk]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Yep, that's the bad boy who broke my arm.
|-
!Meteora
|[snarls at Toffee]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Whoa. Hold your horses. I'm sure Toffee had a good reason for doing what he did.
|-
!Toffee
|You were making that stupid leaf hat, so I snapped your arm.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Okay. Not the best reason. But that doesn't mean he has to keep doing terrible things. If he did, he'd... break my other arm.
|-
!Toffee
|Oh. That's a good idea. [grabs Glossaryck]
|-
!Meteora
|[crying, snarling]
|-
!
|''Meteora pounds on Toffee's pant leg, but he shoves her away with his tail.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Maybe that baby isn't the one who needs to be taught a lesson. Maybe we came to teach ''you''.
|-
!Toffee
|Well, what are you going to teach me?
|-
!
|''Meteora stands up with her eyes closed. She opens them, and they glow bright green. Toffee looks nervous as Meteora levitates off the ground.''
|-
!Meteora
|Deeee... daaaaa!
|-
!
|''Meteora fires ray beams from her eyes that strike Toffee. His eyes turn black, and he releases Glossaryck from his grip.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Okay. That's enough, Meteora. Meteora!
|-
!Meteora
|[stops dipping down, giggles, falls to the ground]
|-
!Toffee
|[gasps deeply] See?! This is the threat of magic! This is what we're at war against.
|-
!
|''Toffee and his fellow Septarians leave.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|I guess you learned two lessons today – how to "dip down," and that jerks like him never learn.
|-
!Meteora
|[giggles]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to Janna; the screen on her mobile phone reads "YOU DIED".''
|-
!Janna
|Not again! Ugh. Now I got to restart from the pickle factory.
|-
!
|''There's a flash of light off-screen, and Meteora is back in her crib. The door opens.''
|-
!Janna
|Oh, hey.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa enters with a bunch of feathers in her hair.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|How did it go? Any trouble?
|-
!Janna
|Yeah, I keep getting stuck on this one jump on level 43. Oh, come on!
|-
!Meteora
|Dee-daa!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Did she just say "Daddy"? [picks up Meteora]
|-
!Meteora
|[giggles]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Did you just say "Daddy"? Oh, my darling! Oh, what a genius!
|-
!
|''Glossaryck is sitting on a pillow. He pulls his right arm off and grows a new arm.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|You know, I think magic's in pretty good hands.
|-
!
