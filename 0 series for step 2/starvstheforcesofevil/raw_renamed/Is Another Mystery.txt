|''Episode begins at [[Butterfly Castle]]. [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] chases [[Glossaryck]] through the castle hallways.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|You stop right there, young— old man!
|-
![[Glossaryck]]
|[[Globgor]]!
|-
!
|''Glossaryck squeezes under the door of [[Buff Frog]]'s (originally Dr. Jelly Goodwell's) office.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah! [panting, enters office] Hey, Buff Frog, sorry about Glossaryck. He gets fussy around, uh... nap time?
|-
!
|''The office is vacant. Glossaryck lies on a folded letter on Buff Frog's desk.''
|-
!Marco
|Oh. Uh, guess he has today off.
|-
!Glossaryck
|[snores]
|-
!Marco
|Come here, you. [picks up Glossaryck]
|-
!
|''Marco notices the letter on the desk. It is addressed to [[Star Butterfly]].''
|-
!Marco
|Hmm. [picks up letter] Guess I'll bring this to—
|-
!
|''The letter opens up in Marco's hand.''
|-
!Marco
|Ohhh! Aah! [covers his eyes] I looked at someone's mail without their permission! Wait. What?! [reads letter] Oh, beans.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Star's bedroom. Star and [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]] are on the balcony together.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|[sighs] I don't know. I feel so weird. I have so much on my mind, and I can't talk to my parents about it. I don't think I can talk to anyone.
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|[awkwardly] Oh! Yes, you can! You can talk to me! Right? Yeah. Yeah, th-th-that's a thing that boyfriends do, right? Listen! Yeah! I'm all ears. I mean, technically I'm mostly eyes. [chuckles] Just talk to me. [puts his hand on Star's hand]
|-
!Star
|[sighs] It's just that—
|-
!
|''Star's bedroom door bursts open off-screen.''
|-
!Marco
|Star! Buff Frog is gone!
|-
!Star
|What?!
|-
!
|''Tom looks annoyed by Marco's interruption.''
|-
!Marco
|I found this letter for you in his office. Look.
|-
!Star
|[reads letter] Wait a second... This letter is legible! Buff Frog didn't write this note!
|-
!Marco
|Exactly!
|-
!Star
|We gotta find him. I'll get my wand! [runs off-screen]
|-
!Marco
|Yes! Weapons! I'm gonna try the lance this time!
|-
!Tom
|Marco. Marco. My man. My dude.
|-
!Marco
|Hmm?
|-
!Tom
|Um, how about I go with Star on this one?
|-
!Marco
|What? No, no. I'm her squire. It's my job.
|-
!Tom
|Okay, okay, yes. But also, as her boyfriend, my job is kinda to spend time with Star. Time you kinda just interrupted. So...
|-
!Marco
|Okay, true. But also, Buff Frog's my friend, and—
|-
!Star
|[summons [[Cloudy]]] Okay, that's enough bickering! C'mon, Marco, let's go!
|-
!Tom
|[whispering, to Marco] Pleeeease...
|-
!Marco
|[looking annoyed] ...Oh! What do you know? Glossaryck is escaping again! [throws Glossaryck over the stairs] That nimble little rascal!
|-
!Glossaryck
|[falls down stairs] Globgor!
|-
!Marco
|Uh, uh, I gotta go catch him before he starts trouble! Sorry, Star! Tom can go with you instead!
|-
!
|''Tom grins happily, and Marco gives him a thumbs-up before following Glossaryck.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|(''o.s'') [weakly] Globgor...
|-
!Star
|Whatever, fine! C'mon, Tom! Let's go!
|-
!
|''Tom jumps on Cloudy's back, and he and Star fly into the sky. Scene cuts to Buff Frog's house in the swamp. Star, Tom, and Cloudy fly down to the front door.''
|-
!Star
|[knocks on door] Buff Frog? [opens door] Buff Frog? [gasps]
|-
!
|''The inside of Buff Frog's house is a complete mess.''
|-
!Star
|This doesn't look right. Buff babies? [picks up three-eyed stuffed animal] I've got a really bad feeling about this.
|-
!Tom
|Well, we tried. Guess he's not home. Do you wanna get a corn shake?
|-
!Star
|Are you for real right now? We are just getting started!
|-
!Tom
|A-All right, well, maybe we could ask someone in the village if they've seen him.
|-
!Star
|[gasps] The monster village! Great idea!
|-
!Tom
|Oh. Yeah. Better than something Marco could come up with?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Star and Tom in the monster village. It is completely abandoned.''
|-
!Star
|Hello?! [echoing]
|-
!Tom
|I don't think anyone's here.
|-
!Star
|This just doesn't make any sense.
|-
!
|''Something thuds off-screen.''
|-
!Star
|What was that?!
|-
!
|''Star inspects the source of the sound and finds a flapping window shutter. Inside the house, there is an unfinished meal on the table and a still-burning stove.''
|-
!Star
|This is troubling.
|-
!Tom
|[looks inside house]
|-
!Star
|C'mon, let's keep looking around.
|-
!Tom
|Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait-wait-wait! I want to get me some of that meat.
|-
!Star
|W-What? Are you serious? That's monster food.
|-
!Tom
|[mumbling "I don't know"]
|-
!Star
|You are gross, dude. What if someone rounded them up? A rogue band of [[Mewmans]] maybe? [gasps] Or worse – [[Mina Loveberry|Mina]]?! Oh, no-no-no-no-no! Everywhere I look, things are getting worse and worse!
|-
!Tom
|I don't know, maybe everyone is out grocery shopping or on a picnic or something. I mean, that's what peasants do, right?
|-
!Star
|Hey, what's that thing on your neck?
|-
!
|''Tom has a tranquilizer dart sticking out of his neck.''
|-
!Tom
|What? I don't have anything in my neck. What's that on your arm?
|-
!
|''Star has a tranquilizer dart sticking out of her left arm.''
|-
!Star
|What? I don't have anything on...
|-
!Tom
|[falls over unconscious]
|-
!Star
|[drowsy] Hey, what... what are you doing... on the ground...? What am ''I'' doing on the ground...? [falls over unconscious]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to black, then cuts to the interior of a forest. Star wakes up with a sack tied over her body.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, gee! Oh! [panting] My face is itchy. Why is my face itchy?!
|-
!Tom
|Because you're in a burlap sack.
|-
!
|''Tom sits up next to Star, his body also in a sack.''
|-
!Star
|Aah! Don't sneak up on me! [punches Tom]
|-
!Tom
|Ow! Sorry.
|-
!Star
|What happened?
|-
!Tom
|I don't know.
|-
!Star
|Where are we?
|-
!Tom
|I don't know.
|-
!Star
|Who did this?!
|-
!Tom
|Star, I know exactly the same amount as you do right now, which is nothing.
|-
!Star
|Somebody really does not want us to know where Buff Frog is. Okay, let's get up. Ready? On the count of three. One, two... [groaning]
|-
!
|''Star and Tom try to stand up using each other as supports. Star successfully stands upright, but Tom falls back onto the ground. He starts spinning around in a circle, screaming.''
|-
!Star
|Tom? Tom! Are you okay?!
|-
!Tom
|I think I just found out I'm claustrophobic, and I might be panicking a little!
|-
!Star
|Me, too! Okay, I think I'm close. Just stay where you are. I'll come to you. No, Tom! No, stay put!
|-
!
|''Tom stands up and starts running around the area.''
|-
!Star
|Tom! It's all right! It's all right! I'm right here! I'm right here!
|-
!
|''Star and Tom run in a circle around each other.''
|-
!Tom
|Aahh! Aah!
|-
!
|''Tom runs off-screen with his horns pointed forward, and there's a loud thunk. Three monsters around a campfire watch the two.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Tom, stop being so difficult!
|-
!Tom
|Huh? [straining] Uh, I accidentally gored a tree, and... Well, n-now I'm stuck.
|-
!Star
|A tree! Aha! Now we know we're in the woods!
|-
!Red-Skinned Monster
|[walks up, roars at Star]
|-
!Star
|Run!
|-
!
|''Star and Tom blindly run away from the monster. Star runs up the length of a tree, pushes off of it, and does a flying kick to knock the monster over.''
|-
!Star
|Woo-hoo! Okay, I don't know what I just did, but I think it was pretty awesome, and I am very proud of myself for it!
|-
!
|''A blue-skinned monster with tentacle-like hair grabs Star.''
|-
!Star
|[grunting] No!
|-
!Blue-Skinned Monster
|I have message for you. Those that search for little lost frogs will find themselves at bottom of swamp!
|-
!Star
|What does that mean?!
|-
!Blue-Skinned Monster
|[pulls sack off of Star] Stop looking for Buff Frog! And to make sure message is clear... break his horns!
|-
!Star
|Aah!
|-
!
|''The red-skinned monster picks Tom up by the horns.''
|-
!Tom
|[screams]
|-
!
|''Buff Frog appears with his [[Buff Frog's tadpoles|tadpoles]] on his back.''
|-
![[Buff Frog]]
|What is going on here?!
|-
!Star
|Buff Frog?! Ah! You're okay!
|-
!Buff Frog
|Hello, Princess.
|-
!
|''Buff Frog's tadpoles dogpile on Star.''
|-
!Star
|[whisper yell] Babiiiieeees! I was so worried! That letter freaked me out.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Letter? I know nothing of letter.
|-
!Katrina
|[steps out from behind Buff Frog] Excuse me. The person who wrote the letter was me. [shrugs her arms]
|-
!Star
|Ahhh! Katrina got li'l arms! [cheek marks turn into muscular arms]
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oy-yi-yi. How many times must I tell children, to become spy, they must not to leave paper trail? Is like number one rule. Kids these days...
|-
!Star
|But your house... It was a mess.
|-
!Buff Frog
|When ''you'' are single parent of pile of kids, I would like see your house!
|-
!Katrina
|I just want Star to know we were leaving.
|-
!Star
|Leaving? Where are you going? Grocery shopping?
|-
!
|''Buff Frog's tadpoles and other monsters gather around him.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|No. We must leave this dimension for good. We cannot stay on [[Mewni]] anymore.
|-
!Star
|What are you... What are you talking about?
|-
!
|''Buff Frog's tadpoles all hold bags of luggage.''
|-
!Star
|What? No! But... No-no-no! No! You can't leave! I need your help to bring monsters and Mewmans together! We're so close!
|-
!Buff Frog
|[hugs Star] Sorry, Star. You tried, but it not work. This not problem you can solve.
|-
!
|''Star's eyes start to tear up. Buff Frog opens a [[Dimensional portal|portal]] with his [[dimensional scissors]].''
|-
!Tom
|(''o.s'') Fools!
|-
!Buff Frog
|[angrily] Beg your pardon?
|-
!Tom
|You heard me! You're all being a bunch of fools right now! How can you say things will never change? Things ''are'' changing. I mean... Buff Frog, you work at the castle now, right? Star did that.
|-
!Buff Frog
|True, yes. But everyone in castle still scared of me. Plus commute is terrible.
|-
!Teenage Monster
|What do you care, your Highness?
|-
!Tom
|What? Why wouldn't I care?
|-
![[Unnamed two-headed monster|Two-headed Monster]] (right)
|'Cause you don't know...
|-
!Two-headed Monster (left)
|...what it's like!
|-
!Eyeball Monster
|Being treated differently, day in and day out.
|-
!Tom
|I do know what it's like, because... I, too, am a monster.
|-
!Star
|Yeah! Wait, what?
|-
!Monsters
|[shocked murmuring]
|-
!Eyeball Monster
|What?!
|-
!Tom
|Well, technically half-monster. I got these eyes, horns, tail.
|-
!
|''A long, red, pointed tail pops out of Tom's pants.''
|-
!Star
|Okay, that's new.
|-
!Tom
|And let's not forget... [burning up] ...this face! Look at it!
|-
!Monsters
|[screaming]
|-
!Buff Frog
|Please, please. Not in front of children.
|-
!Horned Mouse Monster
|Yeah, but I mean, you're a rich guy. I mean, ri-right? He's... He's rich. Doesn't count.
|-
!Tom
|Okay. You're right. I am very rich. Uh, but when I get on an elevator with a stranger, I'm a monster just like all of you. I'm a rich monster, yeah, but I'm a monster.
|-
!Star
|[smiles at Tom]
|-
!Buff Frong
|Thank you for pretty words, purple boy. But for us to stay, we need more than words. Star Butterfly, you are good person. You tried your best, but it was not good enough. I'm sorry.
|-
!Star
|No, no-no-no, Buff Frog, please wait! I can try harder! We have to stick together!
|-
!Buff Frog
|[hugs Star] Goodbye, Star. Perhaps when it is your time to rule, we will come back.
|-
!Star
|My time? But how will you know?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Princess, please. It's me, Buff Frog, master spy. Trust me, I will know. Babushkas, come say bye.
|-
!
|''Buff Frog's tadpoles dogpile on Star again.''
|-
!Star
|Aah! [laughing] You sweet little baby angels. I'm-a miss you so much!
|-
!Buff Frog
|[voice cracking] Okay, no more with the sentimental. Time to go, everyone!
|-
!
|''The two-headed monster stands in front of the portal.''
|-
!Two-headed Monster (right)
|After you.
|-
!Two-headed Monster (left)
|No, after you.
|-
!Two-headed Monster (right)
|No, no, after you.
|-
!Two-headed Monster (both)
|...Together!
|-
!
|''The two-headed monster walks into the portal, followed by the other monsters.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Okay, now you babies.
|-
!
|''The tadpoles jump into the portal one-by-one.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Where is Katrina?
|-
!Katrina
|[to Star] I made you something so you don't forget me.
|-
!
|''Katrina gives Star a purple, blue, and indigo lanyard with her name stitched onto it.''
|-
!Star
|Aw, Katrina! I actually got something for you, too.
|-
!
|''Star gives Katrina the three-eyed stuffed animal.''
|-
!Katrina
|My toy! [runs into the portal]
|-
!
|''Just before walking through the portal, Buff Frog salutes Star and Tom and croaks. They wave goodbye to him. He gives them a smile and leaves. The portal closes.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, Tom, I... I can't believe they're gone. I feel like I've only made things worse.
|-
!Tom
|Have a little faith, Star. I'm a monster. You're a Mewman. If we can make it work, then there's hope for everyone.
|-
!Star
|Aw. Thanks, Tom.
|-
!Tom
|You're welcome.
|-
!
|''Star and Tom hug.''
|-
!Tom
|So did I do better than Marco?
