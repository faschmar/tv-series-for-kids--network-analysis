|''Scene opens inside. [[Queen Butterfly|Queen Moon Butterfly]] is ringing a hand bell.''
|-
!Queen Butterfly
|Kingdoms of Mewni, each year we hold this dance to celebrate the peace between us. Welcome to the Silver Bell Ball. [rings bell]
|-
!
|''[[King Butterfly|King River Butterfly]] stars clapping while everyone else remains silent.''
|-
!King Butterfly
|Whoa! Yeah-ha-ha! Wahoo! Woop! Yeah!
|-
!Queen Butterfly
|The rules of the ball are the same as always. Each royal heir will dance with all the others, representing the bonds between our kingdoms.
|-
!King Spiderbite
|[whispering] Their kingdom got taken over by rats. Ehw.
|-
!Queen Spiderbite
|[whispering back] How could they let that happen?
|-
!River
|Hey! Hey! They were big rats.
|-
!
|''[[Pony Head]] floats over to [[Star Butterfly]].''
|-
!Pony Head
|Ooh, girl. [looking at the Princes] Okay, okay. What do you think of the line-up this year? Be honest.
|-
!Star
|It's just the same bunch of borings as every year, Pony.
|-
!Pony Head
|Emm, okay, that's fine, but, like, check out Prince Larry Kelpbottom. Mm-hmm, okay. It's like somebody came up and hit him with a hottie stick.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, I guess it is kinda cool to see everyone again. [turning] Hey, Princess Jaggs.
|-
!Princess Jaggs
|[waving] Hey.
|-
!Star
|[looking over Pony Head] Hi, [[Princess Spiderbite]].
|-
![[Princess Spiderbite]]
|Hello.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, look, there's your annoying cousin.
|-
!Star
|Yeah. Guess I should say hi. [waving] Hi, Rock.
|-
!
|''Rock is busy typing on his phone.''
|-
!Star
|[louder] Hi, Rock, your cousin, over here. Rock Johansen.
|-
!
|''Rock glances at Star, then back to his phone.''
|-
!Star
|Okay well, he hasn't changed. [turns] Oh, looks like [[Rich Pigeon]] got himself some new legs.
|-
!Pony Head
|[ses an empty chair] Ooh, somebody's missing, Star.
|-
!Star
|Yep. He's always late.
|-
!Pony Head
|Well this is where you two met, isn't it?
|-
!Star
|Mm-hmm.
|-
!Pony Head
|Drama.
|-
!
|''Star doesn't respond; her arms are crossed.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Drama!
|-
!
|''Pony Head looks at Star, who remains unresponsive.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Drama, drama, drama, drama, drama, drama...
|-
!
|''Star clamps Pony Head's muzzle closed.''
|-
!Star
|Pony, no drama this year. I told my parents I was gonna focus on the princess biz.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, come on, you're the bomb at shakin' up these dusty old traditions, girl.
|-
!Star
|Not this year.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, come on.
|-
!Star
|No.
|-
!Pony Head
|Come on.
|-
!Star
|No, Pony. Seriously.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, Did you not hear me when I said come on?
|-
!
|''Pony Head pushes herself against Star's face.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Come on, come on.
|-
!Star
|I'm serious.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
|[from across the room] Shhhhhhhhhhh!
|-
!Star
|I've caused a lot of trouble this summer. It's time to be a better princess.
|-
!
|''The door burns down to reveal [[Tom Lucitor]] as he arrives.''
|-
!Star
|Sunglasses at night. Classy.
|-
!Manfred
|Announcing the arrival of Prince Thomas Lucitor.
|-
!Tom
|Hey, everybody.
|-
!Manfred
|And his parents, Lord and Lady Lucitor, of the underworld.
|-
!
|''Wrathmelior walks across the room. She snorts as her horns scrape the chandelier. She eventually takes her seat along with her husband.''
|-
!King Butterfly
|[waving] Hello, Wrathmelior. [turns] Hi, Dave.
|-
!King Dave
|Hey.
|-
!Manfred
|Will the dancers please stand for the commencement bow?
|-
!
|''All the princes and princesses take their bows. Tom bows to Rich Pigeon.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Did you just see that?
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh ho ho, yes! Ooh, I think the whole room saw that. Girl, you're getting club-snubbed.
|-
!Star
|Oh, no... wait. What is that?
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, I don't know, it's just the best way to get someone all up in your business. Watch. [shout across the room] Hey, Kelpbottom.
|-
!
|''Kelpbottom grins, and gestures to himself.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Kelpbottom! No, no, not you. Not you. The handsome one.
|-
!King Kelpbottom
|You hear that, honey? I'm the handsome one.
|-
!King Pony Head
|[snorts]
|-
!Star
|Pony, what the... I thought you liked him.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, I do, I do. But listen, the more you ignore somebody, the more they fall deeply in love with you. That's like science. It's scientific or something like that.
|-
!
|''Kelpbottom has made his way over to Pony Head. He sniffs Pony Head's mane.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Ugh, okay. Can you please give me some space, 'cause I really need that from you, okay? Thank you. Bye-bye. [to Star] It works every time.
|-
!Star
|Weird.
|-
!Queen Butterfly
|[rings bell] Let the first dance begin.
|-
!
|''No one stands up.''
|-
!Manfred
|Ahem. Anyone? [glances] Oh, my. It seems Prince Thomas has taken the initiative, and he appears to be walking towards Princess Star. Star and Thomas have always been the best dancers at every Silver Bell Ball, and we all know they had a very tumultuous relationship before breaking up last year.
|-
!Star
|[groaning] Manfred.
|-
!Tom
|May I have this dance...
|-
!Star
|[sigh] Well, all right. Let's do this.
|-
!Tom
|Princess Jaggs?
|-
!
|''Some of the Kings and Queens gasp.''
|-
!Jaggs
|Uh, yeah, okay.
|-
!Tom
|You look lovely today.
|-
!Jaggs
|What? No, you do.
|-
!
|''The two player orchestra begins playing.''
|-
!Manfred
|Well, this is a surprising turn of events. No mistake. At the previous Silver Bell Balls, Tom has always chosen Princess Star first to dance.
|-
!
|''Tom refuses to look at Star while he dances.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Pony, I think I am getting club-snubbed.
|-
!Pony Head
|Ooh, this is some next-level club-snubbing. He wants you bad, girl.
|-
!Star
|Ugh. Tom always does this. When is he gonna realize I am not interested? [to herself] Okay, calm yourself, Butterfly. You're a princess, for goodness sake.
|-
!
|''Tom kisses Jaggs' hand.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, it's on.
|-
!
|''Queen Butterfly rings her bell. Star gets up to take her first dance. She walks up to Tom.''
|-
!Star
|Hmm, let's see, let's see. I choose you.
|-
!
|''She points at Rich Pigeon.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, oh, oh!
|-
!Manfred
|Oh, Princess Star has chosen Prince Rich Pigeon as her first dance partner. Could there be a new romance waiting in the wings?
|-
!Star
|[laughing] Oh, Richard. I had no idea you were such a good dancer.
|-
!
|''Rich coos as his weight pulls Star and himself to the ground. Queen Butterfly rings her bell, and Star takes her seat.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Good job, girl.
|-
!Star
|Mm-hmm, that oughta show him.
|-
!
|''Tom and Kelpbottom laugh. Star growls. The musicians begin to play, Tom chooses another Princess other than Star, and Star gapes. Star takes the next turn, and picks the same Princess Tom just danced in an attempt to piss him off. The evening continues. Pony head also joins in the fun by refusing to pick Kelpbottom. Star grows more and more angry but Tom continues to play it cool. Queen Butterfly rings her bell.''
|-
!Manfred
|At last, the dancers have completed the ceremony, and are seated with their parents. [chuckles] All except Star and Thomas.
|-
!King Butterfly
|[To King Lucitor] They're saving the best for last.
|-
!
|''Both kings laugh nervously.''
|-
!Queen Butterfly
|[sigh] Come on, Star. Dance with him.
|-
!
|''Star stomps angrily over to Tom.''
|-
!Star
|May I have this dance... Manfred?
|-
!
|''Everyone gasps.''
|-
!Queen Butterfly
|Oh, dear.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, snap! [laughs while eating popcorn]
|-
!Manfred
|[happily] No one has ever asked me to dance. [giggles]
|-
!
|''The pair begin to dance.''
|-
!Manfred
|Ladies and gentlemen, Star has asked me, Manfred, to the dance floor. I feel like I'm in a dream.
|-
!King Lucitor
|[to King Butterfly] Your daughter just club-snubbed my son.
|-
!King Butterfly
|Your son's been club-snubbing my daughter all night!
|-
!King Lucitor
|My son is a gentleman.
|-
!King Butterfly
|My daughter is a delicate flower.
|-
!King Lucitor
|Delicate flower? Let's see how delicate a flower you are!
|-
!
|''Tom walks out of the hall slowly, sadly looking at star.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, unbelievable!
|-
!
|''The two kings continue to fight as Star follows Tom outside''
|-
!Star
|Oh, No-no-no-no-no, you do not get to make sad eyes at me. This is your fault. Look, I still don't wanna date you. I have been through a lot lately, and what I really need is a friend. But all you wanna do is play your little childish games.
|-
!Tom
|Games?
|-
!Star
|Oh, don't act all innocent, you club-snubber.
|-
!Tom
|What? Star, I was there on Song Day. I-I know you're with Marco now.
|-
!Star
|Oh, Ruberiot. That song is gonna haunt me for the rest of my life.
|-
!Tom
|No, no. It was a huge wake-up call. I finally realized you're not into me. So during the dance, I wanted to do the right thing, and give you space. If-if you'd asked to dance, I totally would've, but... I wanted it to be your choice.
|-
!Star
|Okay, first of all, me and Marco, not a thing.
|-
!Tom
|Really?
|-
!Star
|Hey, not the point. Second of all, giving me space doesn't mean pretending I don't exist. That's just rude.
|-
!Tom
|I was just trying to do the right thing.
|-
!Star
|Well it would've been nice if you didn't ignore me all night.
|-
!Tom
|[bursting into flame, yelling] I don't know how to be nice! At least give me credit for trying. This wasn't easy.
|-
!
|''Tom fire blasts his horse drawn carriage. Star casts a cloudy charm spell, and rises up towards him.''
|-
!Star
|[yelling] You're being really dramatic.
|-
!Tom
|[yelling] Whatever, Star. You know I was just trying to give you what you want.
|-
!Star
|[yelling] This isn't what I want.
|-
!
|''A window breaks as a chair from inside is thrown outside and lands in between the two of them. The two of them look inside to see their fathers fighting physically.''
|-
!King Butterfly
|Look what you did! You're paying for that chair!
|-
!King Lucitor
|I'll pay for the chair when you pay for all the damage Toffee caused. I'm starting to rethink being allies with your kingdom.
|-
!King Butterfly
|Oh, why don't you just crawl back into that little hole you came out of?
|-
!Queen Butterfly
|Please, everyone, settle down.
|-
!
|''The bird royalty coo.''
|-
!Queen Spiderbite
|How could they let that happen?
|-
!
|''Star groans in frustration and walks back over to Tom.''
|-
!Star
|Tom, may I have this dance?
|-
!Tom
|I'd be delighted.
|-
!
|''The two of them scoff at each other and begin to dance. As they dance, their fathers eventually notice their kids' beautiful dancing.''
|-
!King Butterfly
|Aw, look at 'em go.
|-
!
|''Queen Butterfly eventually rings her bell to end the dance. The pair is looking into each other's eyes. Star is smiling.''
|-
!Tom
|Um, Star? We should probably stop dancing.
|-
!Star
|Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. Right.
|-
!
|''Queen Butterfly stops ringing her bell.''
|-
!Queen Butterfly
|And this concludes the Silver Bell Ball.
|-
!
|''The royalty applaud. Queen Lucitor (Wrathmelior) even lets out some fiery tears.''
|-
!Queen Lucitor
|Awwww.
|-
!Star
|I forgot what a good dancer you are.
|-
!Tom
|Yeah, thanks. So, um, would you maybe wanna get a corn shake sometime?
|-
!Star
|Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I could do that.
|-
!
|''Some of the princes/princesses run between the pair while heading out the door.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Beep beep. Excuse us. Look at me, Star. Ooh, it's a new club-snub record.
|-
!
|''Star and Tom both laugh.''
