Buff Frog opens an eye and peers around, noting a hole in the ceiling, then an elevator with sleeping guards, the Meat Fork sleeping on a pile of corn with keys on his belt. He stretched his tongue all the way to Meat Fork, wrapping it around the keys. He chuckles, then refocuses. He pulls on the keys so hard, Meat Fork's pants come off, and both fly into his mouth as he swallows them. He shakes his head, the inserts his tongue into the lock, filling the inside and unlocking the chains. Cut to Buff Frog jump up onto a corn chute and run up it.

|-
!Ludo

|-
!
|''Buff Frog tries to pick up wand, but the spider grabs it with web and Buff Frog gasps. He runs from the spider/eagle duo, grabs Meat Fork, and begins jumping up the walls. The eagle flies after them. Buff Frog reaches a hole, throws Meat Fork up it, and jumps on the Eagle, pushing it down and him up. Buff Frog and Meat Fork climb out of the hole, shake hands and part ways. Buff Frog almost falls down another hole. Cut to Buff Frog writing scribbles in his notebook while [[Boo Fly]] entertains his children.)''

|(in mind:) With vand, Ludo more powerful than ever, but more crazy than ever too. He make Buff Frog intriguing offer, but did I make right choice for my tadpoles? Have crazy idea, but have to make sure I'm not talking out loud first. (holds up mirror) A big black bug bit a big black bear. Rubber baby buggy bumpers. Okay, good. (writing in notebook) Must. Varn. Star.
