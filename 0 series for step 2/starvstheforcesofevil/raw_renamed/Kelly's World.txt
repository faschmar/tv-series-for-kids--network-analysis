|''Episode begins in the Woolandia [[Dimension]]. A [[dimensional portal]] opens, and [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] sticks his head through.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Whooooaaaa! [[Kelly]]'s world is... hairy. All right, let's see here.
|-
!
|''Marco takes out a piece of paper with a picture of Kelly's house drawn on it.''
|-
!Marco
|Kelly's house should be...
|-
!
|''He sees a large mass of hair that matches the drawing.''
|-
!Marco
|Oh! There it is! All right. [steps out of portal] One small step for Marco, and I'm not sure what I'm steppin' on. [walks up to Kelly's house] Okay. Just gonna pretend this is a normal house.
|-
!
|''Marco reaches his arm into the mass of hair, and the doorbell rings.''
|-
!Marco
|You're killin' it, Diaz.
|-
!
|''Kelly's father reveals his face through the giant mass of hair.''
|-
!Marco
|Oh! Uh, hi there. I'm Marco. Is... Kelly around?
|-
!
|''Kelly's father hides his face.''
|-
!Marco
|And he's gone. Is this the right house?
|-
!
|''Kelly's father jumps out of the hair and dropkicks Marco to the ground.''
|-
!Marco
|Ow! [grunts, gasps]
|-
!Kelly's father
|[points sword at Marco's face] Stand and face me, boy!
|-
![[Kelly]]
|Dad? What's going on out here?
|-
!Marco
|This is your dad?! He was trying to—!
|-
!Kelly
|Fight you? Oh, yeah. That's just how us Wooletts say hello. Dad, cool it. You're freaking Marco out.
|-
!Kelly's father
|Oh, right, right, sorry. [puts sword away] Well, now that we're acquainted, Marco, let me give you a hand.
|-
!
|''Marco takes Kelly's father's hand, and he slams Marco onto the ground again.''
|-
!Kelly
|(''o.s.'') Dad!
|-
!Marco
|Uh... Hey...
|-
!Kelly
|So, Marco, what brings you here?
|-
!Marco
|Well, we talked about making tortas [[The Ponyhead Show!|a while ago]]. So, I brought over a few ingredients. At least... they ''were'' ingredients.
|-
!Kelly
|Cool... [plops onto the couch] Let's, uh, make some tortas...
|-
!
|''Two Woolett wrestlers appear on the TV across from Kelly.''
|-
!Wrestler 1
|I'm gonna comb you over real good!
|-
!Wrestler 2
|Not if I get to those split ends first! Just-just kidding. Your... Your hair looks amazing.
|-
!Wrestler 1
|Thanks for noticing. But I'll never reveal my conditioner!
|-
!Marco
|[notices Kelly is depressed] Is something wrong?
|-
!Kelly
|Sorry. I just haven't felt like doing anything or talking to anyone lately. [pulls hair back into ponytail]
|-
!Marco
|Yeah. I know it's been hard since [[Tad]]... you know.
|-
!
|''Kelly's cell phone vibrates, and she picks it up.''
|-
!Kelly
|Ugh! He just won't stop calling!
|-
!Marco
|Uh, who won't stop calling?
|-
!Kelly
|Tad!
|-
!Marco
|Tad's alive?!
|-
!Kelly
|But he's still dead to me.
|-
!Marco
|What happened?
|-
!Kelly
|After [[Conquer|the battle]], he ended up joining this creepy self-help group and started acting all self-righteous. He's become... a nester.
|-
!Marco
|Whaaat?
|-
!Kelly
|[presses "Accept Call" button]
|-
![[Tad]]
|[on phone] Namaste, Kelly. How's it been? Just wanted to say how great ''I've'' been doing since we broke up.
|-
!Marco
|Yeesh.
|-
!Tad
|Now that I'm free of all that negative energy, I'm a provider now.
|-
!
|''Phone screens zooms out to show Tad is a nest for baby chicks.''
|-
!Tad
|It's like, life isn't really worth living unless you're really making a difference in the world.
|-
!
|''The chicks' mother appears and feeds them.''
|-
!Tad
|Anyways, gotta go! Mother bird provides.
|-
!
|''The phone call ends.''
|-
!Kelly
|[imitates Tad] "Mother bird provides." Ugh! I'm sorry, Marco. I'm just in a weird place right now. Besides, I got a bunch of boring errands to do today. This library book's not gonna return itself.
|-
!Marco
|Well, I don't mind running to the library with you.
|-
!Kelly
|Really? But it's so boring.
|-
!Marco
|Then we can make it fun together.
|-
!Kelly
|All right. But don't say I didn't warn you.
|-
!Marco
|Yes, ma'am!
|-
!
|''Marco follows Kelly, and she tosses a suit of red Woolett hair at him.''
|-
!Marco
|Augh! Ugh! What is this?
|-
!Kelly
|You don't want to be caught outside without your hair on, do you? [undoes ponytail and wraps hair around her body] Besides, you're gonna need the extra padding. Trust me.
|-
!Marco
|Oh. [puts on hair suit and follows Kelly] That's not ominous at all.
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly leave the house.''
|-
!Kelly
|Bye, Mom! We're off to the library!
|-
!
|''Kelly's mother is revealed to be the house itself.''
|-
!Kelly's mother
|Bye, sweetie! Don't forget the family ancestral sword!
|-
!Kelly
|Yeah, Mom.
|-
!Marco
|Whaaaaaaat?
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly pass by a large mass of blue hair.''
|-
!Kelly
|So, the library's downtown. We'll need to take the bus.
|-
!
|''The mass of blue hair is revealed to be a Woolett.''
|-
!Blue Woolett
|Huh? Oh, man, I'm late for work!
|-
!Brown Woolett
|Have a good day, sweetie!
|-
!
|''At a bus ticket window, a green Woolett is buying a bus ticket.''
|-
!Green Woolett
|One, please! [groans]
|-
!
|''The ticket lady punches the green Woolett and then gives him a bus ticket.''
|-
!Marco
|I don't know why I haven't gotten around to visiting you sooner!
|-
!Kelly
|[to ticket lady] Two for the downtown express, please!
|-
!Marco
|Oh! Let me get 'em! Two for the downtown expr— [gets punched, grunts]
|-
!
|''Cut to bus interior; Marco has a black eye.''
|-
!Marco
|So, there's no money used here? Everything's done by fighting?
|-
!Kelly
|Yup, everything. Movie tickets are two punches. A hamburger is a kick and a jab. My uncle bought a yacht once. He's still in the hospital.
|-
!Elderly Woolett
|[to Marco] Excuse me, young man, but c-could I fight you for that seat of yours?
|-
!Marco
|Oh, no-no-no-no, please. Just take it.
|-
!Elderly Woolett
|Whaaaaa...?!
|-
!Bus Passengers
|[gasp]
|-
!Marco
|I-Is something wrong?
|-
!Kelly
|Marco! You can't just turn down a fight! That is the most shameful thing you can say to a Woolett!
|-
!Indigo Woolett
|Yeah! How dare you disrespect that old lady! If you won't fight her, I will!
|-
!Teal Woolett
|Hey! I was gonna fight the old lady!
|-
!Deep-Blue Woolett
|I'll fight both of ya to fight her! [screams]
|-
!
|''A fight breaks out among all the bus passengers.''
|-
!Kelly
|Let's get outta here.
|-
!
|''Kelly pulls Marco off the bus, and they run away. The bus itself – a large, yellow, dog-like Woolett with wheels – barks at Marco and Kelly as they flee.''
|-
!Kelly
|Sorry this dumb errand is taking way more time than it should.
|-
!Marco
|I don't mind. I always have fun when I'm around you.
|-
!Kelly
|Thanks, but you don't have to say that.
|-
!Marco
|Hey, since you guys are so into fighting, do you have any dojos around here?
|-
!Kelly
|What's a dojo?
|-
!Marco
|You know, a place you go to practice your sweet moves. [pulls hair into ponytail, kiais, does a karate kick]
|-
!Kelly
|Wool-hair-do!
|-
!Marco
|Wool-what-now?
|-
!Kelly
|Wool-hair-do! [shows library book to Marco] It's the ancient martial art of Woolandia!
|-
!Marco
|Whoa! This looks just like karate! [sits down and opens book] But hairier! In a good way!
|-
!Kelly
|My dad taught me to do these moves when I was a toddler. It was the first fighting style that I ever learned.
|-
!Marco
|Whoa, what's goin' on here?
|-
!
|''Marco points to a picture of one Woolett standing on another Woolett's shoulders.''
|-
!Kelly
|Oh, that's Dual Mode. To do that, you and your partner have to be totally in sync with each other. Like, uh, two Wooletts with one mind.
|-
!Marco
|Looks fun! You wanna try it out?
|-
!Kelly
|Oh, I've never been able to pull it off myself. [turns book page] But how 'bout one of these guys?
|-
!Marco
|Whoa! How is that even possible?!
|-
!Kelly
|Yeah. It's illegal in, like, 12 dimensions.
|-
!Marco
|Well, I won't tell if you won't tell.
|-
!
|''Screen pans up to the sun. Two clouds float close to the sun, and the sun punches them. The sun goes down and the sky gets a little darker to indicate the passage of time. Screen pans back down to Marco and Kelly.''
|-
!Marco
|Wow. If I could pull off a roundhouse kick like that, I'd just roundhouse kick all day.
|-
!Kelly
|[chuckles] That's the dream, right?
|-
!
|''Kelly's cell phone vibrates inside her hair, and she takes it out.''
|-
!Kelly
|Ugh! It's Tad again!
|-
!
|''The phone screen shows a picture of Tad with his hands together in a prayer pose. The words "PEACE" and "FAMILY" and several peace signs are all around him. A caption under the picture reads "One day... I hope you find your own NESTING PLACE".
|-
!Kelly
|Why won't he just leave me alone?!
|-
!Marco
|You could just block him.
|-
!Kelly
|Really?
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, it's pretty simple. [points at "Block Number" button] Just press this button right here.
|-
!Kelly
|Huh. I gotcha. [presses button] Wow. I cannot believe I didn't know about that. Wait a minute.
|-
!
|''The clock on Kelly's phone reads 4:55pm.''
|-
!Kelly
|Is that the time? The library closes in five minutes!
|-
!Marco
|Hey, hey, don't worry. If it's a fight they want, I'm sure we can take 'em.
|-
!Kelly
|Marco, no! We don't play when it comes to library fines! If I'm late, I have to cut off my hair!
|-
!Marco
|What?!
|-
!Kelly
|Yeah. So let's book it!
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly run to the Woolandia Library. Inside, the librarian scans a book titled "HOW TO HUG EVERYTHING" for a young Woolett.''
|-
!Librarian
|Okay, you're all set, dear. Oh, and could you tell your mother "hello" from me? [punches Woolett out of library]
|-
!Young Woolett
|Aah!
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly run into the library, and Kelly slams her book onto the librarian's desk.''
|-
!Kelly
|[panting] Book!
|-
!
|''A clock on the wall above the desk ticks from "ON TIME" to "LATE". The librarian scans Kelly's book, and her scanner beeps several times.''
|-
!Librarian
|Oh, wow. This was due yesterday.
|-
!Kelly
|What?!
|-
!Librarian
|I'm afraid you'll have to pay the overdue fee.
|-
!
|''The librarian presses a button on her desk. The desk splits in half and sinks into the floor. A barber's chair pops up in its place.''
|-
!Librarian
|Let's make this quick. [holds pair of scissors in each of her four arms]
|-
!Marco
|Now, hold on!
|-
!Kelly
|Don't bother, Marco. Everything in my life is a mess right now.
|-
!
|''Kelly sits down in the chair as the librarian sharpens her scissors.''
|-
!Kelly
|What's one more situation that I can't control? [sighs] Life is cruel.
|-
!Librarian
|Yes, it is!
|-
!Marco
|No! Uh... If Kelly doesn't want to cut her hair, then she shouldn't have to! Librarian lady, I challenge you to a fight! [tosses off hair suit] If I win, you let Kelly keep her hair!
|-
!Librarian
|[laughs, puts scissors away] You know, I've always wanted to fight a [[Mewmans|Mewman]]. [takes out four daggers]
|-
!Marco
|Actually, I'm a human.
|-
!Kelly
|Yeah, you are! A soft, squishy human who just threw away his padded hair suit!
|-
!Marco
|Oh...
|-
!Kelly
|Well, I guess we're doing this! [pulls hair into ponytail] Okay. Just so you know, librarians are extremely powerful and fight pretty dirty, so, uh, use this. [gives Marco a short sword]
|-
!Marco
|Whoa! Is this your family's ancestral sword?
|-
!Kelly
|No! Why would I give that to you? [reaches into her hair] Found it!
|-
!
|''Kelly pulls a large sword out of her hair.''
|-
!Kelly
|''This'' is my family ancestral sword!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, dang!
|-
!Librarian
|Ready?
|-
!Kelly
|Okay, you take the left two arms, I'll take the right. And, uh, try not to die.
|-
!Marco
|No promises.
|-
!
|''Marco fights the librarian on her right side. Kelly goes around to her right side and knocks one of her daggers out of her hands, and it flies into a poster on the wall.''
|-
!Librarian
|Ooh, that makes me angry!
|-
!
|''The librarian attacks Kelly with three daggers at once, and one of them cuts off a piece of her hair.''
|-
!Kelly
|Aah!
|-
!Marco
|Kelly!
|-
!
|''Marco jumps in front of Kelly to protect her. They team up against the librarian's three daggers, eventually knocking all of them out of her hands.''
|-
!Librarian
|Aah! [growling]
|-
!
|''Dozens of hair ninjas fly out of the librarian's hair, wielding daggers, maces, and firecrackers. They completely surround Marco and Kelly.''
|-
!Hair Ninjas
|[exclaiming]
|-
!Kelly
|Hey, you know what might be a good idea?
|-
!Marco
|Wool-hair-do?
|-
!
|''Marco jumps inside Kelly's hair, and Kelly undoes her ponytail. A firecracker-wielding hair ninja charges at Kelly.''
|-
!Kelly
|Hyah!
|-
!
|''Kelly punches the hair ninja into the air...''
|-
!Hair Ninja
|[grunts] You punched my butt!
|-
!
|''...and Marco pops out of Kelly's hair, sitting on her shoulders, to punch the hair ninja again.''
|-
!Marco/Kelly
|The Top-Knotted Double Fist!
|-
!
|''The hair ninjas all charge at Marco and Kelly, and they knock them away with a spinning flurry of punches and kicks.''
|-
!Marco/Kelly
|Legendary Side Bangs Sweep!
|-
!Librarian
|[growls, charges at Marco and Kelly]
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly leap into the air.''
|-
!Librarian
|Huh?
|-
!
|''While in the air, they join hands and fly at the librarian with a spinning punch, and she explodes into more hair ninjas.''
|-
!Marco/Kelly
|The Twist Out of Destruction!
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly land on the floor, surrounded by unconscious or incapacitated hair ninjas.''
|-
!Kelly
|Oh, my gosh! That was amazing! Um, I cannot believe we just pulled off Dual Mode! It was like I had your mind or something! I've never felt that way before!
|-
!Marco
|[simultaneously] Oh-ho-ho! ''You'' were amazing! That twirling thing you did! And then we were, like, "whoosh" up in the air! I didn't even know fighting could feel that way!
|-
!Marco and Kelly
|[laughing, sigh]
|-
!
|''Kelly's cell phone vibrates in her hair.''
|-
!Marco
|Uh...
|-
!
|''Kelly fumbles to take her phone out and accidentally presses the "Accept Call" button.''
|-
!Tad
|[on phone] Yo, Kells. It's me again. Tad. Your ex. Saw a tree, and it reminded me of you.
|-
!Marco
|I thought you blocked him.
|-
!Kelly
|[turns phone off, sighs] I... I couldn't do it. I know it's not smart, and I am ready to move on, but...
|-
!Marco
|Actually, I think I ''might'' know how you feel. I mean, I don't ''want'' to have feelings for Star, 'cause they're getting in the way of... [blushes] ...other feelings.
|-
!Kelly
|[blushes] Oh! Wow. Yeah. Then, um... I guess you ''do'' know exactly how I feel.
|-
!Marco
|[chuckling nervously] Oh, yeah. Cool. Sure is a bummer about the timing of these feelings.
|-
!
|''One of the hair ninjas' firecrackers detonate into fireworks. The fireworks knock over a stack of books and turn on a tape cassette player.''
|-
!Female Singer
|♪ Your eyes, your eyes ♪<br />♪ The light in your eyes ♪<br />♪ It's just like the sun ♪<br />♪ Oh, it burns me alive ♪
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly are surrounded by blue and red fireworks.
|-
!Marco
|[stammering]
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly blush and stare at each other until the fireworks stop.''
|-
!Kelly
|Buuuut... if we're honest about it, then maybe we could be break-up buddies?
|-
!Marco
|What's that?
|-
!Kelly
|Well, you kinda help each other forget your old feelings. So you can move on. [kisses Marco's cheek] Also, you can kiss when the mood is weirdly romantic. [chuckles, takes Marco's hand] And you can hold hands.
|-
!
|''Marco and Kelly leave the library hand-in-hand.''
|-
!Marco
|You know, every time I come to the library, I learn so much.
|-
!Kelly
|Ugh. We're hopeless.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, yeah, hopeless. Yeah, it's my middle name.
|-
!Kelly
|Huh. I thought it was Ubaldo.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah. "Ubaldo" is Spanish for "hopeless".
|-
!Kelly
|Really?
|-
!Marco
|No. No, I-I don't think I know Spanish, actually.
