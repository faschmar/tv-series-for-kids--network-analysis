|-
![[StarFan13]]

|-
![[Awesome Opossums]] player
|Oh, yeah! Hit him!
|-
!
|''Star approaches a line of students as bat strikes are heard off-screen.''
|-
!Star
|Ooh, a line! I love lines! [hops up and down] Why are we in line?
|-
![[Sabrina Backintosh]]
|Only for the most important social event of the year – [[Brittney Wong]]'s birthday party!

|-
!Brittney
|Yes.

!Sabrina
|I'm in. I'm in! I'm-in-I'm-in-I'm-in-I'm-in...! [sighs, passes out]

|-
!Flying pig
|[oinks]
|-
!Brittney
|[gasps]
|-
!Star
|Problem solved.
|-
!Flying pig
|Anything for you, Star.

|-
!Flying pig
|Flying pig don't need this. [snorts, flies away]
|-
!Brittney
|[whips hair at Star] Hmph! [walks away]
|-
!Star
|[muffled] I'm going to her party...
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Diaz Household]] exterior at sunset. Star, dressed in a party gown, drags [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] out to the sidewalk.''
|-
!Marco
|It's so weird that ''Brittney'' invited ''us'' to her birthday.
|-
!Star
|And all she wanted was a flying pig. [gasps] The party bus!
|-
!Marco
|Party bus?
|-
!
|''Brittney's party bus approaches from down the street.''
|-
!Marco
|But I get carsick.
|-
!Star
|It's not a car. It's a bus.
|-
!
|''The party bus passes Star and Marco.''
|-
!Star
|Rabbit Rocket Blast!
|-
!
|''Star rockets herself and Marco onto the roof of the bus.''
|-
!Marco
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''Buff Frog spies on Star from a tree branch through binoculars.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Cut to party bus interior. Brittney sings karaoke, and her party guests cover their ears.''
|-
!Brittney
|[singing, off-key]<br />I send texts straight to your heart<br />You replied, baby, that's a start<br />Saw your zit, I knew it was the end<br />Sorry, honey, I have to de-friend<br />Ooooh...
|-
!
|''Star and Marco crash inside through the ceiling.''
|-
!Brittney
|[gasps]
|-
!Marco
|[groaning]
|-
!Star
|See? That was way more fun than taking the stairs. Oh, sweet! A little, tiny hat. Cool. I can make those.
|-
!
|''Star makes a tiny hat for herself that matches Brittney's.''
|-
!Brittney
|Star Butterfly. [drops microphone] What are you doing here?
|-
!Star
|Nothin' yet. I just got here.
|-
!
|''Marco does pushups on the party bus floor.''
|-
!Marco
|One... Two... Three... One... Two...
|-
![[Jackie Lynn Thomas]]
|Marco, what are you doing?
|-
!Marco
|[prolonged gasp, thinking] ''Jackie Lynn Thomas? Play it cool.''
|-
!
|''The bus lurches to a stop.''
|-
!Marco
|[gagging, backs away slowly]
|-
!Star
|Let me sing you some birthday tunes with my mouth sounds. [beatboxing badly]
|-
!Brittney
|Driver, pull over this bus at once!
|-
!Bus driver
|Lady, I can't. We're in bumper-to-bumper traffic. You're gonna have to wait until the next exit.
|-
!Brittney
|[scoffs] This is why I told my dad I wanted a party jet. Hmph.
|-
!Bus driver
|I can't drive a jet.
|-
!Brittney
|Okay. Now, to my ''invited'' guests, who wants to watch me open my presents?
|-
!
|''Pause.''
|-
!Brittney
|I'm waiting.
|-
!Party guests
|Me, me, me! Pick me, please!
|-
!Star
|Something tells me we were not invited to this party.
|-
!Marco
|That's possible. Why don't we get off at the next bus stop?
|-
!Star
|We can't do that. These people are miserable. They need us now.
|-
!Marco
|Star, you don't have to—
|-
!
|''The bus lurches to a stop, and Marco gags sickly.''
|-
!Star
|Are you feeling okay?
|-
!Marco
|I told you. [gags] I get motion sickness. Don't worry. [sits on a chair] I just need to sit here, stare out this window, and never turn my head.
|-
!Star
|You do that, homie. I'ma get this party started!
|-
!
|''Star lightly shoves Marco, causing his chair to spin.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa! Who puts a swivel chair on a bus?!
|-
!
|''The chair rolls to the right.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa! With wheels? Seriously?!
|-
!
|''The chair crashes off-screen. Brittney holds up a handbag.''
|-
!Brittney
|Ugh. It's not designer.
|-
!
|''She throws the handbag away, and it hits Sabrina's face, giving her a black eye and knocking out one of her teeth.''
|-
!Sabrina
|You're welcome.
|-
!Star
|Oh, hey, everybody. I just want you all to know I can make little hats.
|-
!
|''Star makes a [[Laser puppies|laser puppy]] with her wand.''
|-
!Laser puppy
|[yipping]
|-
!Star
|And also dogs.
|-
!
|''The laser puppy shoots a laser from its eye.''
|-
!Girl
|(''o.s.'') Ow!
|-
!Star
|Check this out!
|-
!
|''The puppy makes a laser light show that reads "HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRITTNEY".''
|-
!Party guests
|[exclaiming]
|-
![[Justin Armberg]]
|(''o.s.'') I wish my dog could spell that good!
|-
!Brittney
|Hmph!
|-
!
|''Brittney whips the laser puppy out of Star's hands.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps, thinking] ''Not cool.''
|-
!
|''Scene transitions to Jackie sitting alone with a drink. Camera zooms out to a sick-looking Marco.''
|-
!Marco
|[thinking] ''There she is, Diaz. Jackie Lynn Thomas. You're feeling better. Now's your chance.''
|-
!
|''Marco slowly rolls the swivel chair up to Jackie. Justin appears before Marco and shoves a plate of oysters in his face.''
|-
!Justin
|Hey, do these oysters smell bad to you? [slurping] Yep, taste like they turned. Mmm.
|-
!Marco
|[gagging]
|-
!
|''Marco rolls away from Justin and into Brittney.''
|-
!Brittney
|You better not throw up on my bus, "Barfo" Diaz!
|-
!Marco
|[gulps]
|-
!Brittney
|Ugh! This party is a disaster.
|-
!Star
|Hey, Brittney! I know how to make your party more fun. Rubber Sparkle Bounce House!
|-
!
|''Star uses her magic to turn the inside of the party bus into a bounce house. They start bouncing happily.''
|-
!Party guests
|[cheering]
|-
!Justin
|Walkin' on the moon!
|-
!Marco
|[gagging]
|-
!
|''Brittney stands in the middle of the room with her arms crossed, bouncing lightly due to everyone else's momentum.''
|-
!Star
|Isn't this fun, Brittney? Better idea!
|-
!
|''Cut to party bus roof.''
|-
!Party guests
|[chanting] Hot tub, hot tub!
|-
!Star
|Foaming Twinkle Bubble Ripple!
|-
!
|''Star creates a large clam-shaped hot tub.''
|-
!Party guests
|[cheering]
|-
!Justin
|[rips his clothes off] Yeah! Star Butterfly rules! [jumps into the hot tub]
|-
!
|''Justin jumps into the hot tub. [[Ed]] and two other boys join him.''
|-
!Boy
|I'm all wet!
|-
!Girls
|Yeah, party!
|-
!
|''Cut back to Marco inside the bus, looking green.''
|-
!Marco
|[groaning]
|-
!
|''Star slinks down onto the couch next to him.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, Marco. It's hard work making everybody happy.
|-
!Marco
|Can you make my tummy happy?
|-
!
|''The bus lurches to a stop, throwing Star and Marco onto the floor. The bus stops at a stop sign.''
|-
!Brittney
|Finally. End of the line for the princess and the puke boy. Now get off my bus!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, thank you!
|-
!
|''Marco steps off the bus.''
|-
!Marco
|Fresh air! [inhales deeply] Smells just like... monsters?
|-
!
|''Camera zooms out to show [[Ludo]] and his [[Ludo's army|army]].''
|-
!Ludo's army
|[growling]
|-
!Ludo
|Get them!
|-
!
|''Cut back to bus interior.''
|-
!Brittney
|Ugh, finally.
|-
!
|''Star is thrown backward into Brittney.''
|-
!Brittney
|What is going on here?!
|-
!Ludo
|[[Three-eyed Potato Baby]]! Take the wheel!
|-
!Three-eyed Potato Baby
|[growls]
|-
!Bus driver
|[on the phone] She says she wants a jet.
|-
!
|''Three-eyed Potato Baby picks up the bus driver and tosses him aside. He sits in the driver's seat, fastens his seatbelt, checks his mirrors, and puts on a driver's cap. He spends extra time straightening his cap.''
|-
!Ludo
|Will you get on with it?!
|-
!
|''Three-eyed Potato Baby slams on the gas, and the bus pulls away at high-speed, throwing the party guests toward the back of the bus.''
|-
!Party guests
|[screaming]
|-
!Star
|What's your game?
|-
!Ludo
|[pops open a soda] I'm gonna bus-jack this bus.
|-
!
|''[[Spikeballs]]'' and a crocodile monster stand next to an open dimensional portal.
|-
!Spikeballs
|Here they come.
|-
!
|''A random car drives through the portal.''
|-
!Spikeballs
|Was that them?
|-
!Crocodile monster
|Uh, nope.
|-
!
|''Cut back to bus interior.''
|-
!Star
|That's a particularly stupid plan, Ludo.
|-
!Ludo
|[spit-take] It's a great plan! Shut up! Oh, just... just get her.
|-
!Ludo's army
|[roaring]
|-
!
|''Star runs up to the bus's roof. The monsters chase her.''
|-
!Brittney
|[sighs] Star's the worst.
|-
!Ludo
|I know, right?
|-
!Brittney
|I hope you destroy her.
|-
!Ludo
|Thank you! That is so nice!
|-
!
|''On the bus's roof, Star fights Ludo's monsters. Star blasts [[Beard Deer]] off the bus with a magic beam. A three-eyed monster attacks, and Star knocks him backward with a kick to the face. She blasts Buff Frog and the giraffe monster away with cupcake blasts. As he flies over the edge of the bus, the giraffe monster hangs onto the railing with his teeth. Star blasts the two-headed monster over the side of the bus. As the two-headed monster hangs on, his face hits the window, scaring two of the party guests. He swings over to Star's back with the party banners. When the two-headed monster climbs back up, Star knocks him over again with an elbow to the face. The two-headed monster lands in the passenger seat of an elderly Asian man's car.''

!Asian man
|[speaks Japanese] わたしは八十だが、まだまだ現役じゃあ！''(Revised Romanization: "Watashi wa hachi jūdaga, madamada geneki jā" Subtitled: "Although I'm in my eighties, I'm still healthy!.")''
|-
!
|''Star dodges Buff Frog and [[Big Chicken]], hitting Buff Frog with Rainbow Fist Punch. Buff Frog falls into the hot tub, and Star closes it on top of him. Star runs straight into the giraffe monster.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!Giraffe monster
|[growling]
|-
!
|''Camera zooms in on an overpass sign that reads "CAHOOGA ½, HOLLIWOOD 1, SETSUN 1½". The giraffe monster looks surprised. His head is dragged straight through the overpass. A guy on a bicycle rides up his neck, leaving tire tracks, and falls to the ground. Cut to bus interior. Ludo eats the spoiled oysters.''
|-
!Ludo
|[slurping and laughing] There's a rumbly in my tumbly!
|-
!
|''Cut back to bus roof. Star is overpowered by [[Bearicorn]] and Big Chicken. Star sees the dimensional portal.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Oh, no!
|-
!
|''Star knocks Bearicorn and Big Chicken over and opens the ceiling hatch, poking her head inside the bus.''
|-
!Star
|Marco! Quick, take the wheel!
|-
!Marco
|[shudders]
|-
!
|''Marco slowly makes his way over to Three-eyed Potato Baby.''
|-
!Marco
|[gagging and gasping]
|-
!
|''Marco eventually knocks Three-eyed Potato Baby out with a karate chop. Three-eyed Potato Baby passes out, and his head falls onto the gas pedal, making the bus go faster. Marco grabs the steering wheel. Star falls through the bus ceiling. The bus gets closer to the dimensional portal. Marco cuts the wheel right, causing the bus to veer left and right. It knocks into a fire hydrant, spins through the air, and crashes onto the ground a complete wreck. The party guests emerge from the bus unharmed.''
|-
!Party guests
|[cheering]
|-
!
|''Ludo's monsters emerge from the bus in pain.''
|-
!Ludo's army
|[groaning]
|-
!Bearicorn
|Why did only we get hurt?
|-
!
|''Marco dashes toward a garbage can and throws up.''
|-
!Ludo
|Out of the way!
|-
!
|''Ludo dashes toward the same garbage can, and he and Marco take turns throwing up.''
|-
!Jackie
|Sick. Party animals.
|-
!Brittney
|[looks at bus, pulls at her hair] Oh, this is horrible! My party is ruined!
|-
!Justin
|Oh, man, Brittney! Hot tub, bounce house...
|-
![[Andrea]]
|Laser puppies and an epic fight...
|-
!Party guests
|Best party ever!
|-
!
|''Paramedics carry Sabrina away on a stretcher.''
|-
!Sabrina
|It hurts all over!
|-
!Star
|Just so you know, I also do quinceañeras.
|-
!Brittney
|[swats at Star] Ugh! Hmph! [walks away]
|-
!
|''Marco walks over and puts his hand on Star's shoulder.''
|-
!Marco
|Man, Star, that party was the jam.
|-
!Star
|[removes Marco's hand] Please don't with your puke fingers.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, yeah. Sorry. You know, if I ever have a party, you're gonna be my party planner.
|-
!
|''Marco runs back to the garbage can and continues throwing up off-screen.''
