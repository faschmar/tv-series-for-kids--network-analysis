!Star
|I don't know. Watch. [picks up a lizard] Watch, watch.

!
|''Star tosses the lizard into the waterfall, and it floats up into the sky.''
|-
!Moon
|Oh, that looks super-duper fun.
|-
!Star
|[with her hair in the waterfall] Well, it ain't half bad. You should try it.
|-

|Cannonball!

|A unicorn!
|-
!Unicorn
|Hi.
|-
!Star
|Cool! Where'd you find that?
|-
!Moon
|Oh, just in the other world at the top of the waterfall.
|-
!Star
|Another world?!
|-
!
|''Star looks at multiple upward-flowing waterfalls.''
|-
!Moon
|[to unicorn] I'll always take care of you.

!Star
|[runs toward the waterfalls]
|-
!Moon
|U-Uh, hey, where are you going?
|-
!Star
|To see if there's more worlds. Come on!

|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|All right, we gotta come up with a new plan.
|-
![[Hekapoo]]
|Oh, I got one. Let's run for it! We could just hang at the tavern, wait for this thing to blow over.
|-
![[Talon Raventalon]]
|I second that.
|-
![[Kelly]]
|Uh, that does sound pretty good.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, come on, guys! We're on a mission from the acting queen!
|-
!Talon
|Wait! She's not even queen?!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Marco. The plan didn't work, man.
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|Well, of course it didn't work! I thought we all knew that when he named it the "Doom Nut".
|-
!Marco
|Aw, come on.
|-
!Tom
|Look, we're not following Marco's plans because they're good. We're following them because he's Marco. He is gonna come up with another terrible plan, and when that one doesn't work out, he'll come up with another, and then another. That's why he's our leader, 'cause he's just dumb enough to never give up.
|-
!
|''Marco looks touched by Tom's words.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Um, yeah, that's true.
|-
!Kelly
|Yeah!
|-
!Talon

|We'll take a group photo.
|-
!Talon
|I'm in.
|-
!Kelly
|Well, what are we gonna do about those eyes?
|-
!Talon
|Um, we could put some shades on her. That'll keep her cool.
|-
!Hekapoo
|Ugh, Talon!
|-
!Tom
|Geez, man!
|-
!Kelly
|Come on!
|-
!Talon
|Oh! Only Turdina can come up with ideas!

!Star and Moon
|Ohhh!
|-
!Moon
|I've never seen anything like it.
|-

|[points at statues of [[Glossaryck]]] Who's the guy with the hot dog head?
|-
!Moon
|Oh, he's creepy.
|-
!Star
|I like it.
|-
!
|''Star and Moon go back down the waterfall and go up a different waterfall. They end up in a world blocked off by a wooden sewer grate, which they hit their heads on.''
|-
!Star and Moon
|Oof!
|-
!Star
|Hey!
|-
!Moon
|Let's see what's up there. [pushes against sewer cover, straining] This is dumb. This world is dumb. Let's go.
|-
!Star
|Okay!

|[deep breath]

!

!

|-
!Moon
|What's that?
|-
!Star
|I don't know, but it has way too many legs.
|-
!Moon
|What should we do?
|-
!Star
|Run! [laughing]
|-
!
|''Star and Moon run away from the firstborn.''
|-
!Moon
|We have less legs than you, but we can still run!
|-
!
|''Back on Mewni, Talon struggles with the clasp on the back of Marco's Turdina bloomers.''
|-
!Talon
|[grunting] How does this thing work, man?
|-
!Marco
|Just unhook the clasp in the back.
|-
!Talon
|Oop! Oh, there it is.
|-
!Marco
|Now get in position!
|-
!Talon
|Got it, ma'am!
|-
!
|''Marco climbs up a tree. Hekapoo distracts Meteora by jumping in and out of [[dimensional portal]]s. Meteora throws a tree at her.''

!Hekapoo
|Aah!
|-
!Marco
|Over here!
|-
!
|''Hekapoo runs in Marco's direction and jumps through another portal.''
|-
!Meteora
|Hey!

|Welcome to Britta's Tacos. Can I get your order?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to Mewni.''
|-
!Meteora
|Your friends are doing all the fighting for you? Are you afraid, Turdina?

!Marco
|Turdina... fears... no one!

!Kelly
|Marco! We're good!
|-
!Marco
|Tom!

!

|-
!Tom
|Talon! Cinch the rope!
|-
!
|''Talon drives away from the trees, causing the rope to pull taut and trap Meteora in trees.''
|-
!Talon
|Yeah! That's how you do it!
|-
!Meteora
|[straining] You're only making things worse for yourself!
|-
!Marco
|Whoo!
|-
!
|''Marco jumps off of Meteora's head and floats gently to the ground using his dress as a parachute.''
|-
!Meteora
|[grunting]
|-
!Marco
|Hey, nice work, guys.
|-
!Hekapoo
|I'm impressed. I was pretty sure Talon would mess it up.
|-
!Talon
|Hey! I'm a professional!
|-
!
|''Talon accidentally revs his dragoncycle's engine, causing it to pull away. Still connected to the harpoon's rope, Meteora falls over and rolls down the hill.''

|Oh, no.

|[groaning]
|-
!Meteora
|Whoa-ho!
|-
!Tom
|I got this! [demonic chant]
|-
!
|''Tom opens a fiery fissure in the ground that Meteora falls through.''
|-
!Meteora
|[screams]
|-
!Tom
|And that takes care of that.
|-
!
|''Tom claps his hands together, and the fissure closes shut.''
|-
!Marco
|She's gone!
|-
!
|''Back in the Realm of Magic, Star and Moon hide from the firstborn behind a pair of see-through crystals.''

|[looks for the unicorn] Hmm... Wait. What am I looking for? [gasps]
|-
!Moon
|Aah!
|-
!Star
|Who are you?!
|-
!Moon
|Uh, who are you?!
|-
!Star
|I'm... um...
|-
!
|''Moon suddenly vanishes in a flash of light.''
|-
!Star
|[gasping] Where'd she go?
|-
!Firstborn
|She wasn't supposed to be here.
|-
!Star
|Aww. Well, now I'm all alone.
|-
!Firstborn
|You're not supposed to be here, either.
|-
!
|''The firstborn's horn flashes brightly. Scene cuts back to Mewni. Talon holds [[Nachos]], [[Jorby]], and Pony Head's floating bodies on ropes.''
|-
!Kelly
|Are they gonna be okay?
|-
!Marco
|I... I don't... I don't know.
|-
!Talon
|[tearing up] I guess it's time for that group photo. [lowers sunglasses, sniffles] Get over here, guys. [takes out a selfie stick]

|-
!Tom
|Not today, you turd!
|-
!
|''Tom shoots a fireball at Meteora. Meteora swats it back with her tail, and it flies toward Kelly. She gets hit and falls to the ground.''

![[Tad]]
|(''o.s.'') [weak voice] Kellyyyyy...!
|-
!Kelly
|Wait. What? Tad?
|-
!
|''Camera pans up to reveal Kelly has some of her hair burned off. She sees Tad lying on the ground.''
|-
!Tad
|Kellyyyyy...! Kellyyyyy...! [groans]
|-
!Kelly
|[tearing up] What are you doing here?! You were supposed to move out.
|-
!Tad
|I was just collecting the last of my... [coughs] ...things.
|-
!Kelly
|That's... really mature of y—
|-
!Tad
|And, uh, writing the greatest love poem of all time. Can I recite it for you?
|-
!Kelly
|You don't have to.
|-
!Tad
|Roses are red, your hair is blue. I was a bad boyfriend. I don't deserve... you. Just... let me go. I'm gonna... I'm gonna die now, baby.
|-
!Kelly
|Okay, no, you're not gonna die.
|-
!Tad
|What?
|-
!Kelly
|You're not gonna die.
|-
!Tad
|How do you know? Are you some kind of doctor or something? [coughs]
|-
!Kelly
|Because you never go away. That's the thing with you, Tad. You never go away! Every time I think you're gone, you're back, living inside my hair.
|-
!Tad
|But where am I 'upposed to go?
|-
!Kelly
|Live in the woods, Tad! Live in the woods!
|-

!Meteora
|[inhales] Delicious! [singsong] Turdina!
|-
!
|''Marco and Tom hide behind a rock.''
|-
!Tom
|Marco, it's over. We're the only ones left. I don't think the Marc-nificent Two is enough to stop her.
|-
!Marco
|You're right, Tom, but someone needs to go warn Star. [draws his sword] I'll stay and buy you both some time.
|-
!Tom
|Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I'm not leaving you! You're... You're my best friend.
|-
!Marco
|...I... kissed Star.
|-
!Tom
|W... What?
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, so you don't owe me anything. Now go—
|-
!
|''The sound of Tom running away is heard.''
|-
!Marco
|Wow. No hesitation. [comes out from behind the rock] Hey!
|-
!Meteora
|Oh, hello, Turdina. I've been looking for you.
|-
!Marco
|[drops his sword] Well, I'm right here!
|-
!
|''Meteora picks Marco up with her tail.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa! What are you doing? 
|-
!Meteora
|You're a smart girl. Figure it out.
|-
!Marco
|But aren't you gonna savor this? I'm Princess Turdina!
|-
!Meteora
|Yes, I know. But I'm looking for a queen.
|-
!
|''Just before Meteora blasts Marco with her soul ray, Tom jumps in the way.''
|-
!Tom
|Rah!
|-
!Marco
|Tom!
|-
!Meteora
|Huh!
|-
!Marco
|What are you doing?
|-
!Tom
|[gasps] Calling your bluff!
|-
!Marco
|No! I-I really did kiss Star!
|-
!Tom
|Oh. Well... it's too late now.
|-
!Meteora
|Let's try that again. [sucks out Tom's soul again]

!Meteora
|[...and again...]
|-
!Tom
|[gasps] ...take—

!Meteora
|[...and again]
|-
!Tom
|[gasps] ...a while.

!
|''Meteora starts sucking out Tom's souls at a steady rate. She starts to grow even more in size.''

!Tom
|I may not have—

!Meteora
|[sucks out Tom's soul yet again...]

!Marco
|Hiiiiii-YAH!

!Meteora
|Marco?!
|-
!Marco
|Run...!
|-
!Meteora
|TUUUURDIIIINAAAA!

!
|''Meteora shoots her soul rays and covers the screen in white. Scene fades in on King Butterfly standing over Star.''
|-
![[King Butterfly|King River]]
|What are you doing in bed? You're supposed to be looking for your mother.
|-
!Star
|Oh, Papa. I had the most wonderful dream. There were unicorns with too many legs and marshmallows and Mom. ...Mom? [gasps] Mom!
|-
!River
|You found your mother! Where is she? I don't see her.
|-
!Star
|[sighs] No. I mean... I mean, I did. I did. But... [sighs] She was there. She was standing right next to me, and I let her get away.
|-
!River
|It's okay, dear. We'll just keep looking until we find her. Meteora! Then it has come to this! Ryah!
|-
!
|''River tears off his clothes to reveal a loincloth underneath.''

!Star
|[panting] Marco! Tom?
|-
!Tom
|[holding a rope] I tried, Star.
|-
!Star
|What happened? Where's Marco?
|-
!
|''Camera pans up to reveal Marco's soulless body on the end of Tom's rope.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to black, then cuts back to the Butterfly Groundlands, where Meteora destroys everything in her path. River fires at Meteora with lightning from his staff, but Meteora deflects it with her tail.''
|-
!River
|Scatter!
|-
!
|''River's eagles scatter and dodge Meteora's soul rays. Tom watches from the front of Butterfly Castle.''
|-
!Tom
|Star, she's right behind us. What do we do?
|-
!Star
|Wait a minute.
|-
!Tom
|Uh... Meteora?
|-
!Star
|I'm so dumb.
|-
!Tom
|What?
|-
!Star
|I'm an idiot!
|-
!Tom
|Uh... Oh, no. D-Don't say that.
|-
!Star
|How could I forget the Magic Sanctuary?
|-
!Tom
|What? But Meteora— Aah!
|-
!
|''Star grabs Tom by the arm and pulls him along. They fly away from the castle on [[Cloudy]]'s back.''
|-
!Tom
|Star, where are we going?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the pond where the Magic Sanctuary is located.''
|-
!Star
|This is where me and my mom brought the [[Magic High Commission]] when they were all balloonified. We obviously can't bring the whole kingdom here, but at least we can start with Marco.
|-
!
|''An alligator pokes its head out of the water.''
|-
!Star
|There he is. [gives Marco to Tom] Hold my balloon. [kneels down next to alligator] Bwah! Bwah! Bwah!

|-
!Alligator
|Bwah.
|-
!
|''The alligator crawls back into the water... and eats a fish.''
|-
!Star
|What?! No! No, no, no, this is not how this works! Go get the Sanctuary!
|-
!Tom
|Wh-What did you think was gonna happen here?
|-
!Star
|I-I'm doing the thing my mom showed me! You talk to the Guardian, he swims in, he goes down, the Sanctuary comes up out of the water. W-Why are you looking at me like that?
|-
!
|''A single bubble pops next to the alligator.''
|-
!Tom
|Star, I'm sorry.
|-
!Star
|It-It would have worked if my mom was here.
|-
!
|''Star and Tom hug each other.''
|-
!Star
|But I'm not her. It's all over.
|-
!Tom
|[gives Marco to Star and walks away]

|-
!Tom
|[demonic chant]
|-
!
|''Tom opens a door leading to the [[Underworld]].''
|-
!Tom
|Star, I promised Marco I'd keep you safe. We need to go. Meteora won't find us in the Underworld. We'll be safe and very, very warm.
|-
!
|''Star looks down at the Underworld entrance. The soulless body of a [[Mewmans|Mewman]] bumps against the side of her head.''
|-
!Star
|What the...?
|-
!
|''Star looks up to see dozens of soulless bodies floating through the sky, including the eagles that fought Meteora with River.''
|-
!Star
|Eagles! She got Dad? What am I doing?! I can't leave!
|-
!Tom
|Star?
|-
!Star
|I am the queen, and these are my people. I have to stay and fight.
|-
!Tom
|But Meteora will destroy you!
|-
!
|''Star transforms to her [[Mewberty (phase)|mewberty]] form.''

|Stay here and take care of Marco. [flies toward the castle]
|-
!Tom
|Wha...? Did... Did... Did you know she could do that?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the Butterfly Castle and surrounding groundlands in flames. Star flies up and enters the castle.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''The lifeless bodies of Star's guards and subjects float around the inside of the castle. Star flies past the Tapestry Room; all the tapestries except [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]'s have been ripped up by claws.''

![[Glossaryck]]
|[[Globgor|Globgooooor]]!
|-
!Star
|Aah! Glossaryck! [groans] You almost gave me a heart attack! Now where is Meteora?
|-
!Glossaryck
|Globgor. [runs off]
|-
!
|''As Star follows Glossaryck, Tom floats to the castle balcony using Mewmans' bodies as balloons. He releases the bodies into the sky and enters the castle with Marco.''

!

|-
!Meteora
|[growling]
|-
!Tom
|Oh, shoot.

!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''The painting-covered entrance to one of the castle's secret passageways swings open, with Eclipsa's handcuffs on the entrance frame.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, great. Look, Eclipsa got out. That's awesome. Another thing I gotta deal with.

!

|-
!Tom
|Aah! Oof!
|-
!Star
|Tom!
|-
!
|''Meteora sits where the king and queen's thrones once were.''
|-
!Meteora
|That was so much easier than sucking all those souls. Just one punch. Bam!
|-
!Star
|Tom, you gotta wake up!
|-
!Meteora
|Don't tell me you've forgotten all about your other boyfriend.
|-
!
|''Meteora holds up Marco sitting on one of the thrones.''
|-
!Star
|Marco!
|-
!Meteora
|Isn't it ironic? All that time I was chasing after Princess Turdina, I barely even noticed you.
|-
!
|''Marco floats out of the throne, and Meteora crushes the throne in her hand.''

!Star
|[straining] Okay, I get it! You're angry! If I were in your shoes, I'd be angry, too! But you don't have to do this! We can fix everything!

|You can't fix what your family's done!
|-
!Star
|[groaning] You're right! I can't! You want my power?! Take it!
|-
!
|''As Star focuses her energy, her mewberty wings start to dissipate. All of her energy focuses into a heart shape on Star's chest.''
|-
!Star
|[shouting]
|-
!
|''Star releases the energy from her body and shoots it at Meteora, causing a tremendous explosion. Moments later, Star emerges from the rubble. Meteora emerges shortly after, stumbling around blindly.''
|-
!Meteora
|[groaning] You little brat. Where are you? Where are—? [bumps into stone pillar, whimpers, growls]
|-
!Star
|[points her wand at Meteora] Na... Narwhal... [groans] Narwhal... Huh?
|-
!
|''Eclipsa picks up the wand out of Star's hand, and it transforms into a parasol. She opens it and spins it around before revealing herself.''
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa raises the wand, and it surges with power. Her cheek marks glow brightly.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Star looks at Eclipsa in shock. Meteora approaches Star from behind.''
|-
!Meteora
|Found you!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Midnight... Shriek...!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa points her wand at Meteora. A black skull-like butterfly appears, and a blast of energy fires through the butterfly and strikes Meteora.''
|-
!Meteora
|Mama?!
|-
!Star
|Whaaaaaaat?
|-
!Meteora
|You blasted me!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[closes her parasol] You can't do this, Meteora!
|-
!Meteora
|But they... This... This should all be ours! They stole it from us!
|-
!Eclipsa
|So, what, you're just going to destroy it all?
|-
!Meteora
|Something like that.
|-
!
|''Meteora raises her claw toward Star.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Stop!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa strikes at Meteora with continuous arcs of energy.''
|-
!Meteora
|[groaning] You're on their side?!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[tearing up] Black Velvet Inferno...!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa blasts Meteora with a beam of dark-blue light and light-blue butterflies. The energy wraps around Meteora in the shape of a sphere.''
|-
!Meteora
|[gasping] Mommy...?
|-
!
|''The sphere closes, and Meteora's silhouette is seen through it.''
|-
!Meteora
|[muffled] No! No! [pounding]
|-
!
|''Cracks appear along the outside of the sphere, and it fills with white-hot light.''
|-
!Meteora
|[screams]
|-
!
|''The light disappears, and the sphere's fragments crumble to the floor, leaving only Meteora's tattered dress.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[sobbing gasps, falls to her knees] I'm sorry...
|-
!Star
|What did you do?
|-
!Eclipsa
|...What I had to.
|-
!
|''Kyle, one of the castle guards, floats down from the sky with a balloon-like squeak. He falls to the floor, and his eyes return to normal.''
|-
!Kyle
|I'm... I'm alive! [laughing]
|-
!
|''Other Mewmans also float down from the sky and start returning to normal.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] They're... They're turning back!
|-
!
|''Marco's body falls through the air.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Marco! Aah! I gotcha! I gotcha!
|-
!
|''Star catches Marco just before he hits the floor.''
|-
!Star
|Aah! Oof! Marco! Marco? Marco?
|-
!Marco
|[opens his eyes] Huh? Star! W-What happened?
|-
!Star
|[hugs Marco] I got you, Marco Diaz!
|-
!
|''As Star and Marco look at each other, Tom walks up.''
|-
!Tom
|Awww! I'm... I'm just gonna make this weird. [hugs Star and Marco]
|-
!Star
|Tom! Okay, Marco, this is great, but your butt's making my legs fall asleep.
|-
!Marco
|[laughs, gets off of Star] Sorry.
|-
!
|''Star sees Eclipsa still on her knees in front of Meteora's crater and approaches from behind.''
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa, you... you saved us.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Star? Well, thank you for letting me borrow this.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa gives the wand back to Star. Star looks at the wand, then at Meteora's dress, then at Eclipsa again.''
|-
!Star
|...No. Keep it. This wand was yours. It belongs to you. Things haven't been right since my family took the kingdom. The best thing I can do as queen is return what my family stole from you.
|-
!
|''A baby's cries are heard inside the crater. Eclipsa walks toward the crying.''
|-
!Star
|Uhhh...
|-
!
|''Eclipsa reaches under the tattered dress and picks up Meteora, reverted to an infant. Meteora stops crying and stares at Eclipsa.''
|-
!Meteora
|[cooing happily]
|-
!Eclipsa
|[tearing up] Hello there, little one.
|-
!Star
|WHAT?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[to Star] Thank you.
|-
!Star
|Oh, yeah... Totally-totally-totally...
|-
!
|''Eclipsa opens her wand parasol...''
|-
!Star
|Uh, Eclipsa?
|-
!
|''...and floats off into the night sky.''
|-
!Marco
|What did you just do?
|-
!Star
|Where is she going?
|-
!Glossaryck
|[runs around Star and Marco] Globgor! Globgor! Globgor! Globgor!
|-
!Star
|Yes, Glossaryck, "Globgor". We know.
|-
!Glossaryck
|...No, no, no! Eclipsa's monster love, Globgor! She's going off to be with him. I've been trying to tell you for months. Anyway, see ya around.
|-
!
|''Glossaryck departs similarly to Eclipsa, making a parasol with his forehead gem and floating away. Star and Marco watch him leave, completely speechless. Marco falls over onto the floor in shock.''
|-
!Star
|[[Keith David|Is his voice different?]]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the Monster Temple. Eclipsa floats toward the Temple and enters Meteora's nursery. She uses the wand to blast away the walls and rubble and disintegrate the back wall depicting a monster's four eyes. She walks beyond the wall and finds Globgor frozen in crystal.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[teary-eyed] Hello, my love. We're home.
