|''Scene opens with a shot of a corn field. It changes to reveal Ludo in a cave, being slammed into  its walls due to firing bursts from his wand. ''
|-
!'''[[Ludo]]'''
|[groans] I don't even understand, girls. This thing is impossible to control... [screams, groans] Why won't you work? Hm?
|-
!
|''The wand hums in pulses.''
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Huh? You can talk?
|-
!
|''Bird and spider stare blankly at Ludo.''
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Tell me your secrets.
|-
!
|''The want hums again.''
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Star Butterfly? But I don't want to see Star Butterfly. She doesn't have a wand anymore.
|-
!
|''The wand hums. ''
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Oh, you're right. She doesn't need a wand for me to steal her wisdom. Girls, pack your things. It's time to catch a butterfly!
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the Diaz's home. Smoke is rising into the air. ''
|-
!'''[[Star Butterfly]]'''
| [groans] I'm not good at these new spells. Why can't I just stick with a narwhal blast?
|-
!'''[[Glossaryck]]'''
| Because there are other spells in your book.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Yeah, but...
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Oh, Star. Look. This one's got pictures. Can we do it?
|-
!'''Star'''
|That's got a lot of steps.
|-
!'''[[Marco Diaz]]'''
| [holding spell book off ground] Star, can you just do the spell, please? This book is so heavy. 
|-
!'''Star'''
|Ugh! Alright. [groans] What do I gotta do?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Start with the first one.
|-
!
|''Star strikes a bored looking pose.''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Mmm, close enough. I guess. Now how about this one?
|-
!
|''Glossaryck points to the next picture in the book. Star lazily matches the pose. ''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Mmm. Okay, see to me, it looks like you're gonna wanna get both arms up, [gesturing] like way up together. 
|-
!
|''Star moves her arm an inch.''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| More.
|-
!
|''Star extends her arm another inch.''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Up and out Star. Look at me.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Huh?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| All the way up. Pointing at 11:00.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Earth 11:00 or Mewni 11:00?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| They're the same Star. Ugh, this is impossible.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Look, I know how to cast a spell, okay? Twirl, twirl, twirl, helicopter arms, helicopter arms, warnicorn stampede!  
|-
!
|''A tiny purple warnicorn drops from the sky.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|See, I did it.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| But Star, that's a single warnicorn. A stampede is many warnicorns. [laughs] I think somebody needs to get back to studying her spell book. 
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[crushed by book] Help.
|-
!'''Star'''
|You know what, Glossaryck? I'm done with the book for today. [grabs Marco's feet] Come on Marco. Let's go have fun with our friends.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Oh. I thought we were friends but...
|-
!'''Star'''
|What? Oh, no, no, no, no. That's not what I meant. We're friends. I just don't have fun with you. But that is so fine 'cause it's not like you like having fun, right? Obviously. That's why you're alone all the time. Lonely people can be cool, like you. You're like a wise old hermit. Or like [stuttering], like a wise old monk. Or... or a... a... well I don't really know what you are but...
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Wow. Say no more. I know when I'm not wanted. [descends into a donut box]
|-
!'''Star'''
|No, no, no.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| I won't be bothering you ever again.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Oh my gosh. I am so sorry, Glossaryck. No of course you're our friend.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Uh, is he though? All this guy has ever done for us is hand out weird riddles and eat pudding.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Uh! Don't you talk like that about our friend Marco. We have to make it up to him.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Alright. Look, my Uncle Enrique hid in a box for three days once. I know how to handle this.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the movie theater. Inside, a black and white film is playing.''
|-
!'''Man'''
|We can never be together, Isabel. We're from two different worlds. 
|-
!
|''Something puts a tentacle on the actor's face.''
|-
!'''Isabel'''
|[screeches]
|-
!'''Man'''
|Society will never accept us! [runs away]
|-
!'''Star'''
|[to donut box] See? isn't this fun? Just three good friends watching a movie together. 'Cause that's what good friends do.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| [from inside box] Marco, please tell Star we are not talking.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Star, Glossaryck said he's still not talking. Glossaryck, can you be nice and pass this popcorn-candy mix to Star?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Hmm, let me think. No, but I will have these. [takes all of Marco's other food]
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Hey!
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Oh, Boom Nuggets. I know where you're going.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[mumbling] They're my Boom Nuggets.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Hey, no big deal. I'll just make us some more snacks. [takes out wand]
|-
!'''Marco'''
|No wait!
|-
!'''Star'''
|Cotton candy cloud!
|-
!
|''A pink cloud appears over Marco's head.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Huh. That worked out better than...
|-
!
|''A bunch of spaghetti falls out of the cloud and onto Marco.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Ugh. You know, it might not kill you to study a bit more.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Oh don't you start too Marco.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Glossaryck, you'll miss the whole movie if you stay in there. I thought you liked romantic comedies. 
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. I've seen this one before. And the squid lady dies in the end.
|-
!'''Crowd'''
|[groans, throws popcorn at the trio]
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the Diaz's house. It is night. Something walks into Star's room.''
|-
!'''Marco (disguised)'''
| [screeches]
|-
!'''Star'''
|[screams, starts attacking] I can't hold her back much longer. Glossaryck, help me.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Marco, could you do me a favor and tell Star she should ask one of her Earth friends to help out? [opens soda, burps]
|-
!'''Star'''
|[sigh] You can stop Marco. He called our bluff.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[takes off disguise, screeches]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Stop Marco.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Oh, sorry.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to inside a dumpster somewhere.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|This is the most disgusting dumpster in town.
|-
!
|''Star throws the box of donuts Glossaryck is in inside. ''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|The smell will get him out of the box.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Alright! We're getting Glossaryck back.
|-
!
|''The two high-five while a garbage truck rolls up to the dumpster.''
|-
!'''Both'''
|[gasp]
|-
!
|''The truck picks up the trash; the box of donuts balances between two crush doors.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Glossaryck!
|-
!
|''A dimensional pair of scissors pokes out of thin air. Star almost runs right into its blade.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Aah!
|-
!
|''The portal opens up. Ludo flies in with bird and spider.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|What the? 
|-
!
|''The trio lands, revealing Ludo dramatically.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Ludo‚Åà You're back?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[gasps] Ludo's back!
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Yes, I am.
|-
!'''Star'''
|I tossed you into the abyss.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|She tossed you into the abyss.
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Yes, you did.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[growls, raises wand]
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|[raise wand, sees Star's] What?
|-
!'''Star'''
|[sees Ludo's] Huh?
|-
!'''Both'''
|You have a wand?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|You both have wands.
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Okay, seriously Marco, that's getting annoying.
|-
!'''Star'''
|[to Marco] Actually, he's right.
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Star Butterfly, you're coming with me [screams]
|-
!
|''Ludo's wand fires, flinging him backwards into a wall. The blast hits a building, causing it to explode.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Rainbow fist punch!
|-
!
|''Star's spell wimpily deflates instead of attacking Ludo.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|What?
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Ha ha! That's your rainbow punch?
|-
!
|''Spider and bird approach Marco. They jump on him. Ludo fires more shots at Star, who screams as they narrowly miss.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Heart attack!
|-
!
|''The spell does nothing to disarm Ludo.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|This is the worst wand fight I've ever seen.
|-
!
|''The garbage truck starts closing its crush door, threatening to destroy Glossaryck's box.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Oh no, I don't have time for this. [runs]
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Hey, we aren't done. Come back here.
|-
!
|''The two continue to misfire their respective wands.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Seriously?
|-
!
|''Ludo continues to scream as his wand thrusts him around the sky, causing a lot of destruction. Marco continues fighting spider and bird. Marco then sees the crush door lowering and throws a garbage can lid into it to hold the door open.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Nice.
|-
!
|''The battle continues''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Star, the lid. It isn't holding.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Glossaryck!
|-
!
|''A blast from Ludo's wand knocks her over the the truck as it crushes the box.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Oh no! Glossaryck!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|No!
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|[landing on ground] Now Princess, I give you a choice. Come with me or die.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Warnicorn stampede!
|-
!
|''The spell misfires a small harmless warnicorn like it did before.''
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|Fine. Have it your way. [holds up wand] It's going to be pretty hard to miss from here.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Star!
|-
!
|''The donut box uncrumples, blasts itself through the air, and trips Ludo. Glossaryck levitates out of the box.''
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| [meditating] Om!
|-
!'''Star'''
|Glossaryck?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| [whistles]
|-
!
|''The spell book smashes its way out of the Diaz's house, rolls down the street, and flies into Star's hands.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|[gasps]
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|What? A book.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Now read.
|-
!
|''Star rereads the page on "Incantation Dance" and immediately starts striking the correct poses, charging up her wand with energy.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Warnicorn stampede!
|-
!
|''Behind her, 5 warnicorns pop into existence in a fanfare of light, and charge.''
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|What is that?
|-
!
|''The warnicorns attack, sending Ludo, spider, and bird plummeting back into their portal.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Oh.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|You did it! That was so cool.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Yeah it was! And all I had to do was read from the book.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Well, my work here is done. [dives into book]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Glossaryck. [grabs book] I'm sorry we hurt your feelings.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Oh, you didn't hurt my feelings. I have no feelings. It was all part of the plan.
|-
!'''Star'''
|What do you mean, part of the plan?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Yeah, why'd you lock yourself in the donut box then?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| I went into that box on purpose because I needed to get to that candy. 
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Oh! Wait, why?
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Well, how would you rocket yourself from a trash compactor? 
|-
!'''Marco'''
|What? I don't know.
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Marco, Marco. I had to be in that donut box so I could land at Ludo's feet to trip him up and save the day.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Wait, wait. So you're saying you did all that on...
|-
!'''Glossaryck'''
| Boom Nuggets. [laughs]
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[sighs] Fine.
|-
!
|''Scene jumps back to Ludo. He and his minions fall into the cave from the portal.''
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|[laughs, to wand] Guess what.
|-
!
|''The wand hums.''
|-
!'''Ludo'''
|There's a book.
