|'' Scene opens with Janna painting a rainbow on Star's cheek hearts. She and others are in the bathroom, giving each other makeovers.''
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
|There. What do you think?
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
| I love it!
|-
![[StarFan13]]
| Me next, me next, me next! [knocks over Star] And make me look exactly like Star. [grabs Janna] And I mean exactly.
|-
!Star
|Fun sleepover, huh, guys?
|-
!StarFan13
|Best sleepover ever!!
|-
!Star
|And it's about to get a lot better.
|-
!
|''Star's wand, functioning as a timer, rings. The scene changes to the kitchen''
|-
!Star
|I never made brownies before. I used real magic sprinkles.
|-
!All
|Mmm! [some make a face]
|-
![[Jackie Lynn Thomas]]
| So good, right?
|-
![[Pony Head]]
|Yes.
|-
!
|''StarFan13 eats as many as possible.''
|-
!StarFan13
|Yes! [with mouth full of brownies] Oh, so good.
|-
!
|''The crowd hears some jazzy piano music playing. They find Marco in the living room with a keyboard, fake playing.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Oh, hey girls. I was just practicing piano. It's jazz.
|-
!Star
|Hi Marco.
|-
!Jackie
|Ooh! I didn't know you played, Marco. Yeah!
|-
!
|''Marco lowers his sun glasses, and the two stare into each other's eyes briefly.''
|-
!Marco
|Oh hey, Jackie. Didn't see you there.
|-
!
|''Marco begins moonwalking across the living room, but trips on a change in elevation between rooms.''
|-
!Marco
|[falling] Whoa!
|-
!Star
|Are you okay? Why don't you come and try one of my brownies?
|-
!Marco
|Brownies? [to Jackie] These days, I'm sticking with the protein shakes. It's what keeps these bad boys happy [flexes biceps]
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh oh, uh-huh. You got it bad.
|-
!Marco
|Bad? No [laughs nervously]
|-
!Pony Head
|It's game time, Marco. [laughs] And since you're so good at playing the field, I got a game that would be perfect for you.
|-
!
|''Scene changes. They are all looking at a blue-green cube.''
|-
!All
|Wow!
|-
!Marco
|It's a box.
|-
!Pony Head
|It's called [[Truth or Punishments]]. It's all about telling your friends your deepest, darkest secrets.
|-
!Marco
|And I'm out. [runs away]
|-
!Star
|Give me one second. Marco!
|-
!
|''Marco keeps running away.''
|-
!Star
|Marco, Marco, Marco, Marco. [blasts him with wand] Why don't you wanna play?
|-
!Marco
|I just think maybe some things are better kept secrets.
|-
!Star
|What are you talking about?
|-
!Janna
|Oh Marco, come play with us. [giggles]
|-
!Jackie
|Yeah Marco. Come share secrets.
|-
!Marco
|[laughs nervously]
|-
!Star
|He's coming.
|-
!Marco
|I hate you.
|-
!Pony Head
|Okay, it's supposed to ask three questions, each one harder than the last, and all we do is answer them. So...
|-
!
|''Pony head claps her ears together, and the lights go out. The cube starts glowing when Pony Head sticks her tongue on it.''
|-
!Cube
|Deceit and fables, lies and fiction, even with complete conviction. If truth is absent from these events, all will face the punishments.
|-
!StarFan13
|What does that mean?
|-
!Janna
|It means if you lie to him, something bad'll happen. 
|-
!
|''The cube expands to reveal a mouth. ''
|-
!Cube
|Pledge an oath of truth. Pinky swear to me.
|-
!Star
|Okay. 
|-
!
|''Star puts her pinkie in the cube's mouth.''
|-
!Star
|I promise to tell the truth. 
|-
!
|''Her friends take turns doing likewise''
|-
!Janna
|The truth.
|-
!StarFan13
|The truth.
|-
!Pony Head
|[using her tongue instead] The truth.
|-
!Jackie
|The truth.
|-
!Marco
|The truth.
|-
!Cube
|It's time for Truth or Punishments.
|-
!Star
|Oh-ho! Pony, this is already awesome.
|-
!Cube
|The first question:
|-
!
|''Everyone looks tense as the cube spins for a question.''
|-
!Cube
|What is... your... favorite color?
|-
!Star
|Uh, Pony?
|-
!Pony
|Oh, girl, maybe the first one is just very easy. The next one's probably something interesting, like, have you ever killed a man. Mm, actually, that's still easy.
|-
!Marco
|Pony Head, favorite color?
|-
!Pony Head
|Pony Head color. Done.
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!Star
|It's a very popular color on Mewni.
|-
!StarFan13
|Uh, Star, what's your favorite color?
|-
!Star
|Uh, I have to go with yellow.
|-
!StarFan13
|[gasps] Me too.
|-
!Star
|No way!
|-
!Both
|[giggle]
|-
!Marco
|Jackie?
|-
!Jackie
|Neon green. How about you?
|-
!Marco
|Well, I like red.
|-
!Janna
|Blood red?
|-
!Marco
|Uh... no. Just like, hoodie red.
|-
!Janna
|Well, I like black.
|-
!Marco
|I can see that.
|-
!Jackie
|Oh, black is my second favorite.
|-
!Marco
|Black is pretty cool.
|-
!
|''The room is suddenly filled with red light.''
|-
!Cube
|Someone is lying.
|-
!
|''The cube sends out a blast of red lightning which tickles everyone in the room. They all start uncontrollably laughing. ''
|-
!Star
|[still laughing] Whoever lied, speak up.
|-
!Janna
|Okay. I love pink. It's my favorite.
|-
!
|''The room is filled with green light.''
|-
!Cube
|Truth.
|-
!All
|Pink⁈
|-
!Janna
|I just hate contributing to gender stereotypes.
|-
!Cube
|Janna likes pink and fights the patriarchy.
|-
!
|''The cube levitates into the air, and removes all the light from the room. It segregates Star's room from the rest of the house by sealing it inside a large cube with sides that look like circuit boards.''
|-
!Star
|That was awesome!
|-
!Marco
|[walking around the new space] Yeah. It's like we're inside the game.
|-
!Cube
|Second question. What did you... really... think of... Star's brownies?
|-
!Star
|Pshh. Easy. Everybody loved my brownies.
|-
!Pony Head
|Okay yes, they were every um, watchamacallit, very good, right guys?
|-
!Janna
|Yeah they were great. 
|-
!Jackie
|Yep. Good brownies Star, ha ha.
|-
!Marco
|Actually, I didn't have a brownie, so I guess I missed out. 
|-
!Jackie
|Oh, that's too bad Marco, because they were...
|-
!
|''Jackie's face starts inflating like a balloon.''
|-
!Jackie
|...really good.
|-
!Marco
|Jackie?
|-
!Janna
|Yeah. Delicious.
|-
!
|''Janna's face also inflates. The others follow suit.''
|-
!Marco
|What⁈
|-
!Star + StarFan13
| What's happening to us?
|-
!Pony Head
|[whinnies]
|-
!Cube
|Someone is lying. And this is what lies look like on the inside.
|-
!All
|[scream]
|-
!Star
|Wait. Who didn't like my brownies?
|-
!Jackie
|I just... ha ha... uh...
|-
!Marco
|No. I told you, I didn't even have a brownie. Somebody tell the truth. Quick.
|-
!Janna
|Okay. Fine. Sorry Star, I lied. Those were, like, the worst brownies ever.
|-
!Star
|Huh?
|-
!StarFan13
|Poor Star.
|-
!Jackie
|Okay, I lied too. Those brownies tasted like dirt.
|-
!Pony Head
|Okay, if I had a stomach, I would be very sick inside of the stomach, okay?
|-
!StarFan13
|Well, I loved her brownies. 
|-
!
|''Everyone immediately inflates some more, becoming even more grotesque.''
|-
!StarFan13
|Okay okay, I lied. The brownies were horrible. 
|-
!Cube
|Truth.
|-
!
|''Everything turns back to normal''
|-
!Star
|Okay, I don't wanna play this game anymore.
|-
!Pony Head
|Yeah. I'm sorry I brought this stupid game now. Come on, let's go to the Bounce Lounge.
|-
!All
|Yeah / Good idea / Let's get outta here.
|-
!
|''As they try to exit, the exit door pushes all of them back into the room.''
|-
!Cube
|Nobody leaves until you answer the final question. Who do you... have a... crush on?
|-
!Marco
|Okay, let's do something else.
|-
!Jackie
|Okay guys, we can do this. Let's just answer and end this. [they all hold hands] Go ahead, game. We're ready.
|-
!Cube
|[to Jackie] Who do you have a crush on?
|-
!Jackie
|Okay, this really cute guy from skate camp last summer. He's really nice. 
|-
!All
|Aww!
|-
!Jackie
|See? That was easy. Okay, now you go Marco.
|-
!Marco
|No, thanks. I, uh, I'm good. It's Star's turn, I'm sure.
|-
!Cube
|I say who goes next, and I say Star goes next.
|-
!Star
|Oskar Greason. Everybody knows that.
|-
!StarFan13
|Good choice.
|-
!Cube
|StarFan13, your crush?
|-
!StarFan13
|[grabbing Star] Star Butterfly of course.
|-
!Cube
|Pony Head?
|-
!Pony Head
|Well, if we're really being honest here, and we're gonna be vulnerable, I guess I just have to admit it and say, it's me. I love myself.
|-
!All
|[mutters]
|-
!Star
|Go Pony.
|-
!Janna
|Well, I think we all know who I have a crush on. Don't we, Marco?
|-
!Marco
|Uh...
|-
!Janna
|Eighteenth-century poet John Keats.
|-
!Marco
|Heh heh.
|-
!Cube
|Okay Marco Diaz. Your crush.
|-
!Star
|Oh Marco, you don't have to...
|-
!Marco
|No. It's... it's fine. Ugh. Okay. My crush... my crush is on Jackie. Jackie Lynn Thomas.
|-
!Jackie
|What?
|-
!
|''The room is filled with red light''
|-
!Cube
|Somebody lied big time!
|-
!
|''The cube starts emitting lightning''
|-
!Star
|[screaming] Who lied⁈ Janna, was it you again?
|-
!Janna
|No. It is John Keats.
|-
!Jackie
|Mine is the cute guy from skate camp.
|-
!StarFan13
|Ha ha. I love Star [hugs Star].
|-
!Star
|And I love Oskar Greason.
|-
!Pony Head
|Marco!
|-
!Marco
|I told you, I have a crush on Jackie. At least I think I do. But what does that really mean? I've put her on this sort of pedestal. So do I like the image of her or who she really is? I mean, I like her enough to know that she deserves someone who wants to get to know her, which is definitely me. 
|-
!Jackie
|[smiles]
|-
!Cube
|Wow! I always get to the truth, but that... kudos, really. But you weren't the one who lied!!
|-
!
|''The cube turns into a monster, laughs evilly, and prepares to attack.''
|-
!Star
|Don't worry guys. I got this.
|-
!
|''Star blasts the monster, but it does nothing. The floor raises Star higher up, and she screams.''
|-
!Marco
|Star!
|-
!Pony Head
|[flying upwards] Hold the seat.
|-
!
|''The others are also moved closer to the ceiling by the floor.''
|-
!Janna + Jackie
|Marco! Jump!
|-
!
|''The room continues to shift. Everyone holds on to Pony Head, as she struggles to hold them all above the chaos. A platform moves, and they all crash down in a pile. The monster laughs and goes in for the kill.''
|-
!Star
|Stop it! What did we do to deserve this?
|-
!Monster's face
|Lies are a plague
|-
!Monster's other face
| A virus
|-
!Monster's face
| A weed.
|-
!Monster's other face
| And to stop a weed...
|-
!Monster's face
| You must kill the roots.
|-
!Star
|But it's not really lying.
|-
!Both faces
|Huh?
|-
!Star
|Sometimes, you don't know what you think. Your head and your heart disagree. You think you know how you feel about something, but then it changes. Pony, ask me my favorite color.
|-
!Pony Head
|You already said it. It's yellow.
|-
!Star
|Ask me again.
|-
!Pony Head
|What's your favorite color?
|-
!Star
|Right now? Blue.
|-
!
|''The room turns green, indicating Star speaks the truth.''
|-
!Cube
|Wait! Stop it! You can't change your mind?
|-
!Star
|Jackie, who do you have a crush on?
|-
!Jackie
|Uh... I don't... I don't know anymore.
|-
!Cube
|No! [screams]
|-
!Star
|You think that everything is black and white, and you can't. 
|-
!Cube
|Stop!
|-
!Star
|It's a bunch of different colors, a rainbow of feelings that's always changing.
|-
!
|''The monster spins violently, turning back into its original cube form, but now it's black and damaged. Scene briefly changes to a trash can. The cube is now in it. Then it jumps back to the Diaz's house.''
|-
!Star
|Thanks for coming to my sleepover. 
|-
!
|''Some of the girls groan.''
|-
!Jackie
|Thanks, Star. Crazy night, huh?
|-
!Marco
|Yeah. Crazy.
|-
!Jackie
|See ya at school, Marco.
|-
!Star
|Bye, ladies. [looks at Marco] Uh, hey. What say we get our Sunday morning breakfast burritos?
|-
!Marco
|Nah. Not today, Star. I'm gonna go catch up on some Z's. [muttering to self] My room's that way. [giggles]
|-
!Star
|Marco?
|-
!
|''Scene changes to outside the house. The trash is being taken away by the garbage man. ''
|-
!Star
|Marco Diaz! 
|-
!Cube
|Truth. Star Butterfly has a crush on...
|-
!
|'' The garbage truck's doors come down, and the cube is crushed.''
