|''Scene opens in the woods. Marco unpacks gear from the car. Star is hiding in the trunk.''
|-
!'''[[Star Butterfly]]'''
|Camping!
|-
!'''[[Marco Diaz]]'''
|[screams]
|-
!'''Star'''
|[jumping out] What's up nature? You're gonna get tamed! 
|-
!'''Mosquito'''
|[buzzes, lands on star]
|-
!'''Star'''
|[gasps] Nature's touching me. Hey little guy. 
|-
!'''Mosquito'''
|[bites Star]
|-
!'''Star'''
|[gasps] Cataclysmic total extinction death blast! 
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Star, we're not on Mewni. [sprays bug repellent]
|-
!'''Mosquito'''
|[flies away]
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Nature's nice here. You'll see. We'll do some fishing, a little hiking, and then... this! [holds up map]
|-
!'''Star'''
|[gasps] A treasure map?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|What? No. It's Old Youthful. One of the oldest geysers on Earth. And guess when it's erupting.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Today?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Mmmm-hmmmm. Well, we got a big day ahead. Let's get started. [grabs fishing pole]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Aren't your parents coming?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Nah. You know how most parents show slide shows of their vacations? Mine show paintings. 
|-
!'''[[Rafael Diaz]]'''
|[painting] And done. Next!
|-
!'''[[Angie Diaz]]'''
|[changes pose]
|-
!'''Rafael'''
|[starts a new canvas]
|-
!'''Star'''
|So it's just the two of us then? 
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Yeah. Is that okay?
|-
!
|''An explosion occurs as something falls from the sky forming a crater. Star and Marco run over to check it out. There is someone in the crater...''
|-
!'''[[King Butterfly]]'''
|Camping!!
|-
!'''Star'''
|Dad!
|-
!
|''The scene changes. Marco, Star, and her father are fishing. The King does sit-ups on the boat, rocking it greatly.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Dad, oh, it's always great to see you. But what are you doing here?
|-
!'''King'''
|[straining] What, I can't go camping with my own daughter? I taught you how to camp.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Yeah, and now Marco's showing me how to go camping here on Earth. 
|-
!'''King'''
|Really? Is he showing you how to stalk a Narinthian tar beast for eleven days with no food, no sleep, and no clothes⁈
|-
!'''Star'''
|No Dad, nature's really nice here. Look at what it gave me [holds out mosquito bitten arm]. Love bites. Here Marco. Show Dad how to Earth fish. 
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Yeah, sure. [hands him a fishing pole]
|-
!'''King'''
|Whoa. So how do I... [hook falls in water] Amazing. Now what?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|You're already doing it.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Yay Dad!
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[lowers his line] Now we just sit and wait. 
|-
!'''King'''
|[after waiting] You wait for the fish to come to you?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Just relax and take it all in. [breathes deeply] Smell that? Okay. Where'd he go?
|-
!
|''The King surfaces from the lake, holding a giant boulder over his head.''
|-
!'''King'''
|Fishing!! [swings rock] Yah. Take that and that. [finds leg, grabs and punches] Oh, gotcha now. 
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Is that what fishing on Mewni looks like?
|-
!'''King'''
|[shakes leg vigorously]
|-
!
|''The scene changes. The trio is hiking''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|It says Old Youthful actually got its name from early settlers who believed that it had rejuvenating powers.
|-
!'''Star'''
|That sounds really...
|-
!'''King'''
|Boring! Why are we walking so slow?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Well, I was trying to take it easy 'cause you know, what you did to your foot.
|-
!'''King'''
|But I don't even feel it. 
|-
!'''Star'''
|Come on, let me magic you up some boots. 
|-
!'''King'''
|I don't need any of that; I don't even need feet. [jumps onto his hands] Can you do this, huh? Can you do this? [kicks Marco lightly] I don't think you can. Want a piggyback ride, honey?
|-
!'''Star'''
|[laughing] Aw, Dad. [serious] No.
|-
!'''King'''
|Since when are you too cool for piggyback rides?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Well, I'm not too cool for a piggyback...
|-
!'''King'''
|That would be weird Marco. [takes off] Race you to the water thing. [laughs]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Is that the right way?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|No. [runs towards him] Is your dad okay?
|-
!'''Star'''
|I think so. He just really loves family camping trips. [takes out wand] Okay, where'd you go, big guy? [wand points to high up in a tree] Got him. What's he doing way up there?
|-
!
|''Star uses her wand as a magic parasol, and the two of them float up the King, who's in an eagle's nest.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Hey Dad. Everything alright?
|-
!'''King'''
|Shh! Staring contest.
|-
!
|''An eagle stares unblinking at the king.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Whoa! That's a bald eagle. We are breakin' a whole bunch of laws here. 
|-
!'''King'''
|He started it.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Marco's right Dad. Let's go see Old Youthful. 
|-
!'''King'''
|Don't worry, darling. Once I break his spirit with my eyes, he'll fly us there. [speak gibberish to eagle]
|-
!'''Eagle'''
|[stares]
|-
!'''King'''
|Llama pajama llama... [pokes his eye on each syllable] pa... ja... ma.
|-
!'''Eagle'''
|[stares]
|-
!'''King'''
|This guy's unbelievable. You can't let him beat you in front of your own daughter. She looks up to you. Does she though? What is that supposed to mean? Did you notice, she's pretty much over your piggyback rides. She used to love those. And she went camping without you. That Marco kid's probably her boyfriend. What? No way.
|-
!
|''Marco and Star stare at the king.''
|-
!'''King'''
|My little girl isn't dating yet. Whatever. Keep lying to yourself, old man. Old? Who are you calling old?
|-
!
|''A siren goes off, and the king loses his focus. It is two park rangers who have come to apprehend the three. Scene changes to the ranger station. The King drops many coins on the table to pay the fine.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Something is definitely goin' on with my dad.
|-
!'''King'''
|Okay, everything's cool. Turns out that feathered thing was some kind of a sacred animal. Heads up would've been nice.
|-
!'''Ranger'''
|You folks better get a move on if you wanna see that old geyser.
|-
!'''King'''
|Who are you calling an old geezer⁈
|-
!
|''Scene changes. The trio is hiking again.''
|-
!'''King'''
|Oh. Geyser. 
|-
!'''Star'''
|Yes Dad, the thing Marco's been trying to see all day.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|We can still make it in time. This trail should take us straight to it. 
|-
!
|''The trail forks into a myriad of paths. ''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Let me see that map. 
|-
!'''King'''
|[crumples it up, eats it]
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Is he eating the map?
|-
!'''King'''
|I was hungry. Everything is food when you're struggling to survive. 
|-
!'''Star'''
|Except we're not on...
|-
!'''King'''
|Mewni. Right. Sorry. 
|-
!'''Marco'''
|I'm staying positive about this. One of those trails is the right one. Maybe we'll get lucky. Eeny, meeny, miney...
|-
!
|''Scene changes. They are now looking at a sign that says "Old Youthful 50 Miles"''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Nooooo!
|-
!'''King'''
|You know what? I think this may be my fault. You kids wait right here while I score us a ride. 
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Oh man, if he could get us a ride, that would be...
|-
!
|''Scene changes to them riding a bear with four ranger vehicles and a helicopter in pursuit''
|-
!
|''Scene changes again to the ranger station. The king pays another load of coins and his crown.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|[groans]
|-
!'''Ranger'''
|You'll never make it to Old Youthful now. He goes off in five minutes, and it's a ten-mile hike.
|-
!'''Star'''
|I'm sorry Marco.
|-
!'''King'''
|Oh, come on. What's the big deal?
|-
!'''Star'''
|Dad, what is up with you?
|-
!'''King'''
|Is this about the bear?
|-
!'''Star'''
|No Dad. You've been acting really weird all day, and now Marco's plans are basically ruined. He really wanted to see Old Youthful.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|No Star, I've seen it, like, ten times. I wanted you to see it. You've shown me all kinds of amazing stuff I never knew existed. I just wanted to pay you back. Show you something amazing here on Earth.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Marco!
|-
!'''King'''
|Marco.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|I guess we can come back to see Old Youthful erupt some other time.
|-
!'''Ranger'''
|Oh, you poor, poor boy. Didn't nobody tell you?
|-
!'''Marco'''
|What?
|-
!'''Ranger'''
|This here eruption is gonna be the last.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|What⁈
|-
!'''Ranger'''
|Those big-city scientists gave that geyser a look-see, and he's all dried up. He's been fadin' away for years. Oh, he used to be impressive. King of the geysers. But now, he's just a sad shadow of his former glory. Aged out and obsolete. Ready to retire and getting in everybody's way. Yes sir, to use clever wordplay, Old Youthful is plumb out of youth.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|We should just go.
|-
!'''King'''
|[dramatically] Yes, Marco. We will go... and see that geyser.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Didn't you hear what that guy said? It's impossible.
|-
!'''King'''
|Is it?
|-
!'''Ranger'''
|Tick-tock. [slowly] tick... tock.
|-
!'''King'''
|What do you say, Star? One last piggyback ride from your old man?
|-
!
|''Dramatic music plays as the King carries Star on one shoulder and Marco on the other as he runs through the forest, unstopping, through the leaping deer, past the eagle's nest, jumping up a waterfall, across rocks like a goat, through the war, surviving cannon blast.''
|-
!'''Marco'''
|We're almost there. Just a glacier and two more war re-enactments.
|-
!'''Star'''
|You hear that, Dad?
|-
!'''King'''
|Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
|-
!
|''Scene changes. A geyser is surrounded by lots of people taking pictures. But as the King arrives, it suddenly stops and the people walk way.''
|-
!'''King'''
|[groaning]
|-
!'''Marco'''
|No!
|-
!'''King'''
|[falls face first on the ground]
|-
!'''Star'''
|Dad!
|-
!'''King'''
|I'm so sorry pumpkin. I let you down.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Are you out of your mind? You ran ten miles in five minutes; that's like, a hundred and fifty miles an hour.
|-
!'''King'''
|I used to be able to do it in four minutes. I'm not that dad I used to be Star. You need someone younger to take care of you now. Someone like... your boyfriend Marco here.
|-
!'''Marco'''
|I'm not her boyfriend. You fell up a waterfall dude! Who does that?
|-
!'''Star'''
|I'm older too Dad, but I still need you. No matter how old I get, you'll always be my hero because you'll always be my dad.
|-
!'''King'''
|Come here you [hugs star]
|-
!'''Marco'''
|Well, it's gettin' chilly out, so what do you say we go find you some pants? [slaps the King's back]
|-
!'''King'''
|[stumbles, falling on top of the geyser's crater]
|-
!
|''The geyser rumbles, erupting in a huge blast of water which sends the King soaring high into the sky and creates a rainbow.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Wow!! 
|-
!
|''At the ranger station''
|-
!'''Other ranger'''
|You gotta stop lying to the tourists about that geyser, man. 
|-
!'''Ranger'''
|Yeah I know, but it sure is fun. 
|-
!
|''Back at the geyser.''
|-
!'''Star'''
|Marco. It's beautiful. 
|-
!
|''The king lands on the ground, creating another huge crater. It burns away a lot of his outside.''
|-
!'''King'''
|Look Star.
|-
!'''Star'''
|Dad. You look so young. 
|-
!'''Marco'''
|yeah. Fresh-out-of-the-womb young.  
|-
!'''King'''
|Brand new dad! 
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the Diaz's place. Mr. Diaz is showing off the paintings he created.''
|-
!'''Rafael'''
|And here's the king with his arms up. [changes painting] And here's the king putting his arms down. [changes painting] And here he is walking out of the crater. [changes painting] And climbing out of the crater...
|-
!'''Star'''
|This is so much better than a slide show.
