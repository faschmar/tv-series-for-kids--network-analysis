|''Episode begins on a carriage being pulled by invisible goat traveling to [[St. Olga's Reform School for Wayward Princesses]]. Inside the carriage, [[Pony Head]] is putting makeup on something.''
|-
![[Pony Head]]
|Okay, you need to hold still. One more second. It needs to be perfect. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm!
|-
!
|''[[Marco Diaz|Marco]], dressed as "Princess Marco Turdina", is shown wearing a lot of eyeliner, blush, and lipstick.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|How do I look?
|-
!Pony Head
|[holds a mirror up to Marco's face] Super pretty!
|-
!Marco
|[gasps, covers his face] Oh, no.
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|What's the matter? You don't like it?
|-
!Marco
|[smears makeup on his face] No, I... I know I look amazing. It's just... Ugh! I can't go back to St. Olga's like this! I gotta come clean!
|-
!Pony Head
|[spits out mirror] Mm-mm! If you tell those girls that you have been lying about being a princess, they will destroy you.
|-
!Marco
|I still can't believe they want to give me an honorary degree.
|-
!
|''Marco holds an invitation to St. Olga's. The word "Wayward" is crossed out and replaced with "Doing Just Fine".''
|-
!Marco
|Ugh. I know I inspired a generation and all, but I can't keep lying!
|-
!Pony Head
|Whatever. It's your funeral.
|-
!
|''The carriage suddenly stops, and Marco is thrown out of his seat.''
|-
!Marco
|[groans]
|-
!Pony Head
|Hey, goat! Just because you're invisible doesn't mean I can't hurt you! Oh. We're here. Mm. [leaves the carriage] Come on, ladies.
|-
!
|''Star follows Pony Head out of the carriage. Marco's dress can't fit through the carriage.''
|-
!Marco
|[grunting]
|-
!Star
|You're having a princess problem.
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] Yeah, I'm having a princess problem.
|-
!Star
|Okay, stand up straight.
|-
!Marco
|[stands up straight]
|-
!Star
|Arms forward.
|-
!Marco
|[holds his arms out in front of him]
|-
!Star
|And exhale.
|-
!Marco
|Exhaaaaale.
|-
!
|''Star pulls Marco through the carriage door.''
|-
!Marco
|Oh! Well, you've obviously done this before.
|-
!
|''Dance music plays at St. Olga's School, and princesses are heard cheering.''
|-
!Marco
|Okay. I can't do this. [runs back toward the carriage]
|-
!
|''A spotlight shines down on Marco.''
|-
!Turdina Fan
|(''o.s.'') Princess Turdina, where you going?
|-
!
|''Princesses cheer for Marco.''
|-
!Fish Princess
|Sign my poster!
|-
!Minotaur Princess
|Sign my cat!
|-
!Minotaur Princess's Cat
|[meows]
|-
!Cactus Princess
|Sign my face!
|-
![[Princess Arms]]
|[shoves through the crowd] Okay, people, don't crowd her! Princess Turdina! It is truly an honor.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, please, you don't have to—
|-
!Princess Arms
|We can't wait to show you what we've done with this place.
|-
!Marco
|Whoa!
|-
!Princess Arms
|[opens school doors] Welcome to Utopia!
|-
!Star, Marco, and Pony Head
|[gasping]
|-
!
|''Princesses party and play games around the main school lobby. One princess is holding a boombox. Two other princesses are playing foosball. Three other princesses ride a large wolf monster through the room. A prince lies sleeping on a pile of trash with a slice of pizza on his head.''
|-
!Prince
|[gasps] Where am I?
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, it's so beautiful!
|-
!Marco
|Wow, this is, uh... [opens a book on tea party etiquette and finds a slice of pizza] ...really something.
|-
!Princess Arms
|Oh, we got rid of all those oppressive classes about manners and "please" and "thank you" and all that other trash. We have our own curriculum now!
|-
!
|''Princess Arms points to a class schedule painted on the wall. It reads "11am—7pm: Brunch. 7pm—11am: Party!"''
|-
!Marco
|Brunch and... party. When do you sleep?
|-
!Princess Arms
|Oh-ho-ho, don't worry about it!
|-
!Marco
|You know, sometimes structure isn't a bad thing.
|-
!
|''The dance music stops.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|What?
|-
!Marco
|I just think that rules have a place—
|-
!Princess Arms
|Yeah, but you told us to never conform! If you weren't being honest about who you are, then this whole school would be built on a lie!
|-
!Marco
|Uh, what I meant to say was rules have a place... in the garbage! Ha-ha!
|-
!Princess Arms
|Oh, ha-ha! Oh! Oh, good one. That was... Oh, you had me.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the school dining hall, where several princesses are talking. One princess is sleeping on a stack of pancakes.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|Here's some princesses hard at work on their brunch final. We don't believe in grades. No, we don't. Just pancakes.
|-
!Troll Princess
|[noisily eating pancakes] I love learning!
|-
!
|''Cut to the school gardens, where princesses are seen gossiping.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|These are the whispering gardens, our designated gossip area, because a princess's voice shall not be silenced! [gasps] Oh, my gosh, did you hear that Beatrice and Alfred broke up again?
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, no way!
|-
!
|''Cut to empty school courtyard, where only a DJ is seen behind turntables.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|And this is where we have our party class to celebrate our freedom from the reign of Miss Heinous!
|-
!
|''A deflating balloon blows through.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|I see what you're seeing. It's cooler at night.
|-
!
|''Cut to school interior; Princess Arms opens a pair of doors.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|This... is the Hallway of Turdina!
|-
!
|''The hallway is filled with portraits, posters, and other memorabilia of Princess Marco.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa.
|-
!Princess Arms
|This is the very first Turdina poster we hung up. All of your T-shirts, and all of your dolls, and a lock of your hair, and a poster of your movie!
|-
!Star
|Oh, I gotta get a DVD of that!
|-
!Marco
|This is too much!
|-
!Princess Ram
|Are you kidding? We owe this whole school to you. You showed us that all princesses don't have to fit into the same mold.
|-
!Chicken Princess
|[squawks]
|-
!Marco
|Pfft. No, I didn't.
|-
!Princess Arms
|And we're gonna show you our appreciation by throwing you the biggest party this school's ever seen!
|-
!Marco
|A party? For me?
|-
!Star
|Uh, Marco, isn't there something you wanted to tell these girls?
|-
!Marco
|Oh! Yeah, um... [clearing throat] It's not criminal to be an individual!
|-
!
|''The princesses cheer for Marco.''
|-
!Princess Ram
|She said her catchphrase!
|-
!Pony Head
|Aw, you are way much more fun as Turdina!
|-
!Lizard Princess
|Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! It's here! It's here!
|-
!Marco
|What's here?
|-
!Lizard Princess
|[pulls Marco to front of the school] Check it out! Isn't it amazing?
|-
!Marco
|Whoa.
|-
!
|''A large statue of Princess Turdina is seen in front of the school.''
|-
!Princess Ram
|In honor of the one princess who changed our lives, we dedicate this to you!
|-
!Marco
|[blushing] I'm so beautiful...
|-
!Minotaur Princess
|I hope you do like it, Princess Turdina! It took all year to save up enough to get it made!
|-
!Two-Headed Princess
|We cleaned toilets on weekends for extra cash!
|-
!Princess Arms
|But it was worth it because you showed us that there's another way to live.
|-
!Princesses
|[cheering]
|-
![[Princess Smooshy]]
|Hey, hey! It's time for a group selfie in front of the statue.
|-
!Marco
|Oh. Okay, sure. [smiles for the camera]
|-
!Princess Smooshy
|Camera phone! Mm! [snaps picture]
|-
!Star
|Are you... enjoying this?
|-
!Pony Head
|Hey, this is the first time he's ever been popular! Don't ruin it for him.
|-
!Star
|Well, he should tell the truth like a decent human being. [goes up to Marco] Hey, Turdina, can I talk to you for a sec?
|-
!Marco
|Sure. Uh, bye, ladies!
|-
!Star
|[pulls Marco aside] Marco, I think you're running out of time to tell the truth.
|-
!Pony Head
|Don't even listen to her, Turdina! These princesses worship you!
|-
!Star
|Yeah, but they worship someone who doesn't exist. Marco is the most organized, rule-abiding person I know.
|-
!Pony Head
|Think of the party!
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, they spent all that money for the statue. I can't crush their spirits.
|-
!Star
|I'm just worried you might be letting this attention get to your head.
|-
!Marco
|What? That's not it! This is for them, not for me!
|-
!Princess Arms
|Princess Turdina, come on! It's time for your ceremony!
|-
!
|''Several princesses prepare a palanquin for Marco to ride to the ceremony.''
|-
!Marco
|I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm going with Pony's advice.
|-
!Pony Head
|Whoo! Good choice.
|-
!
|''Marco gets on the palanquin and claps his hands. The princesses carry him to the ceremony. Scene cuts to ceremony stage, where Princess Gwendolyn does an interpretative dance.''
|-
!Princess Gwendolyn
|Oppression! Eternal darkness! Suddenly, light! Freedom! Turdina! [releases doves into the air]
|-
!Princesses
|[looking confused]
|-
!Princess Arms
|[through microphone] Thank you, Princess Gwendolyn, for that beautiful interpretive dance. And now, the moment you've all been waiting for. The woman herself – Princess Marco Turdina!
|-
!
|''Marco appears from behind the curtains, and the princesses cheer for him.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|I present you this honorary St. Olga's degree.
|-
!Marco
|Wow!
|-
!
|''Marco's degree reads "St. Olga's Degree (Cool!)" and is decorated with various stickers.''
|-
!Princesses
|[chanting] Turdina! Turdina! Turdina! Turdina!
|-
!Marco
|Dearest princesses, congratulations on this wonderful school. I know you see me as an idol, but today you're ''my'' idols! You embody everything that Princess Turdina... uh, um, that ''I'' stand for – not letting anyone force you to be something you're not, living by your true colors, loving who you are!
|-
!Princesses
|[cheering]
|-
!Marco
|I'm proud to have inspired you to be brave, even when it's scary. And when being true to yourself might mean disappointing... thousands of people. Um... [looks at Star]
|-
!Star
|[looking sad]
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] That's... That's why I have to tell you the truth. I, Princess Marco Turdina, am a boy!
|-
!
|''Just as Marco says "boy", his words are drowned out by the sound of a chainsaw. A [[dimensional portal]] opens, and [[Miss Heinous]]' car comes out, with [[Rasticore]]'s torso tied to the front.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, no.
|-
!
|''[[Gemini]] comes out of the car, walks around to the other side, and opens the driver side door. Miss Heinous steps out.''
|-
!Princesses
|[gasping, screaming]
|-
!Princess Jaggs
|Ooh!
|-
!Mouse Princess
|It's Miss Heinous!
|-
![[Miss Heinous]]
|Princess Turdina is a fraud, and I have the evidence to prove it! [holding cassette tape labeled "Princess Turdina's Confession"]
|-
!Princesses
|[muttering]
|-
!Princess 1
|It's a tape...
|-
!Princess 2
|It's a tape of what?
|-
!Miss Heinous
|That's right, I watched your video and saw your dark secret!
|-
!Marco
|Oh, that phony confession I did? Go ahead, show 'em! It's not real!
|-
!Miss Heinous
|Oh, no, it's not... But this is!
|-
!
|''Miss Heinous pulls down on Marco's dress collar and reveals his single chest hair.''
|-
!Princesses
|[gasps and exclamations]
|-
!Princess 3
|Wait! Is that a hair?
|-
!Miss Heinous
|Turdina isn't a princess! She's a boy!
|-
!Princesses
|[gasping]
|-
!Marco
|How'd you know about Rodrigo?!
|-
!Humanoid Princess
|Whatever! That doesn't prove anything! Princesses can be hairy!
|-
!Hairy Princess
|Yeah! We believe in you, Turdina!
|-
!Marco
|No.
|-
!Princesses
|[whispering]
|-
!Star
|[smiles]
|-
!Marco
|I lied to you. [takes off his dress] I... am a boy.
|-
!Princesses
|[gasping]
|-
!Princess Jaggs
|[intrigued] Ooh! [blushing] Oop! I mean, ugh!
|-
!Miss Heinous
|This, princesses, is why you need me running St. Olga's. Look where all this freedom got you – living in filth and championing a "hero" who's been lying to you all along. Henceforth, you must reinstate me as your schoolmaster! You need me... and I need you.
|-
!Star
|Wait, what did she just say?
|-
!Princess Arms
|Wait, no. Why does it matter if he's a boy? Nothing he said was wrong!
|-
!Minotaur Princess
|Yeah! He can think for himself and so can we!
|-
!Princess Ram
|He can be a princess if he wants to!
|-
!Princess Arms
|Turdina's a state of mind!
|-
!Princesses
|[cheering]
|-
!Miss Heinous
|Silence! Silence!
|-
!
|''Miss Heinous gets hit in the face with a water balloon.''
|-
!Princesses
|[gasps]
|-
!Star
|Ooooh! I just got her right in the face!
|-
!Pony Head
|[neighs excitedly] Come on, girls!
|-
!
|''The princesses rush toward the stage.''
|-
!Princess Ram
|Free will!
|-
!Miss Heinous
|No! No! [runs away]
|-
!
|''Gemini fends off the princesses with Rasticore's torso tied to his back.''
|-
!Gemini
|Spare me!
|-
!Miss Heinous
|Get in the car!
|-
!
|''Miss Heinous and Gemini get in the car as the princesses rush up to it.''
|-
!Princess
|Turdina lives!
|-
!
|''Miss Heinous backs the car up, and it flies away into a dimensional portal.''
|-
!Princesses
|[cheering]
|-
!
|''A robot DJ starts playing club music, and the princesses start dancing.''
|-
!Marco
|Well, looks like Turdina's gone for good.
|-
!Pony Head
|[crying] Yeah! Because you took her away from us, you selfish monster!
|-
!Star
|You look like you can breathe a lot easier now.
|-
!Marco
|Mostly 'cause I'm out of that dress! That corset was killin' me!
|-
!Mouse Princess
|[walks up to Marco] Could we get a selfie with Marco Turdina, Boy Princess?
|-
!Marco
|Sure.
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, Pony Head, Mouse Princess, and Minotaur Princess pose for a selfie with Mouse Princess's phone.''
|-
!All
|Camera phone!
|-
!Mouse Princess
|Oh, Smooshy's gonna be so jealous of this one!
|-
!Minotaur Princess
|Where is Smooshy, anyways?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to another dimension, where Miss Heinous, Gemini, and Rasticore use a machine to transfer youth energy from Princess Smooshy to Miss Heinous. Because of the energy transfer, Smooshy looks emaciated. When the transfer is complete, Smooshy collapses on the ground. Miss Heinous pulls the transfer device off her head, and she looks younger with glowing cheek marks.''
|-
!Miss Heinous
|Ahhh! Oh, yeah, that's good! Gemini, we gotta get more of this stuff.
|-
!Gemini
|Oh, yes, but I'm afraid this one is out of juice, milady.
|-
!Princess Smooshy
|[weakly] Camera phone...
|-
!Miss Heinous
|I know that, you fool! I'm not talking about her!
|-
!Gemini
|Well, I'm happy to share some of mine with you.
|-
!Miss Heinous
|No! I want the good stuff. I'm coming for you, Princess Marco Turdina!
|-
!Gemini
|I don't mean to interrupt, milady, but we say this all the time. "I'm coming for you..." Maybe we should just stay in tonight, and you can have a little Gemini fuel?
|-
!Miss Heinous
|No. Nobody asked you. Go get the car!
|-
!Gemini
|U-uh... Of course, milady.
