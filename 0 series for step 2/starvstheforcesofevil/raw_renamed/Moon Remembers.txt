|''Episode begins in New Monstertown; [[Star Butterfly|Star]], [[Marco Diaz|Marco]], [[Moon Butterfly|Moon]], and [[River Butterfly|River]] ride into town on [[warnicorns]].''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|So, yeah, those are the big changes. [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]] is queen, monsters live among [[Mewmans]], ''and'' there's this new kind of chocolate called carob. It's not very good.
|-
![[Moon Butterfly]]
|Hmm. The things that happen when you lose your memory.
|-
!Star
|Yep, things are a bit different!
|-
![[Slime Monster]]
|Hey, Star! You want some hay?
|-
!Star
|No, thanks. Uh, I'm good.
|-
!Moon
|Monsters living among Mewmans. I never thought I'd see the day.
|-
!Star
|So, now that you've seen it, you're, uh, not mad, right?
|-
!Moon
|No, I'm not mad. It's just different. Different can be good.
|-
!Star
|Oh, good! [chuckles] Wait, you do remember what monsters are, right?
|-
!Moon
|Star, I know what monsters are.
|-
![[River Butterfly]]
|Moonpie! Does this mean your memory is back?!
|-
!Moon
|It's getting there.
|-
!River
|Huzzah! Oh, wait. Does this mean you remember our 14th anniversary?
|-
!Moon
|[laughs] You got sick on the Twirly-Whirly Wheel and threw up in our caramel corn.
|-
!River
|What?! I was hoping that one would be lost to the ages.
|-
!River's [[Warnicorns|warnicorn]]
|[whickers, stops walks]
|-
!River
|Aah! [falls on the ground] Oof!
|-
!Star
|Well, here we are! The new and improved Monster Temple! I know it's got a lot of stairs, but, y'know, sometimes it's a nice stroll.
|-
!Moon
|[gets off her warnicorn, kneels down next to River] You know, a walk might be nice with proper company.
|-
!River
|I'm proper company. [bird lands on his head]
|-
!Moon
|Yes, you are.
|-
!Star
|[gets off her warnicorn]
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Soooo... Didn't you, uh... [chuckles] ...leave something out?
|-
!Star
|Hmm? Nope, nope. Think I caught her up!
|-
!Marco
|What about the 50-foot monster inside that place?
|-
!Star
|Um, who?
|-
!Marco
|[[Globgor|Globgo]]— [Star covers his mouth] Mmph.
|-
!Moon
|Come on! I'll race you up the stairs!
|-
!River
|[laughs] Okay!
|-
!Marco
|What? I can't say "Globgor" now? [[Glossaryck]] said nothing but the word "Globgor" for, like, the last year.
|-
!Star
|Marco, I don't know what we're gonna do about... [whispering] the "Plucker of Limbs". [speaking normally] But I'll deal with it when I figure it out, okay?
|-
!Marco
|Oh, I get it. So you're just gonna avoid the problem then?
|-
!Star
|[walks up temple stairs] You don't understand. I grew up with stories of Eclipsa's monster love. If she saw him face to face, she'd lose her mind! Again! Again, Marco!
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] Maybe just don't make a big deal out of it? Your mom might be cooler than you think.
|-
!Moon
|[panting, reaches top of the stairs] I win!
|-
!River
|[out of breath] Yes, you win.
|-
!Star
|Or, Marco, we can sweep it under the rug until I find a good time to tell her. And as my squire, I order you to be duplicitous in this plan.
|-
!Marco
|W-Where'd you learn that word?
|-
!Star
|So, Mom, what do you think of the place so far?
|-
!Moon
|Well, I last remember it being in ruins, so it's nice.
|-
!Star
|Oh! Wait until you see the inside. [opens temple doors] Eclipsa's been fixing it up real nice. You can barely even smell [[Ludo]] lived here.
|-
!Moon
|Ah, yes, Ludo. [mimicking Ludo] "Turns out you're dead." I remember him.
|-
!Star
|See? She got tapestries, chandeliers, some tasteful paintings.
|-
!Moon
|[looks at lizard statue] What's that?
|-
!Star
|Oh, that's her sculpture collection. Eclipsa looooves sculptures.
|-
!Moon
|Wow. What beautiful... art.
|-
!River
|You call that art? [flexes his muscles] ''These'' are masterpieces! [chuckles]
|-
!Moon
|Well, it looks like Eclipsa's really making this place her own.
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|(''o.s.'') Moon?
|-
!
|''Eclipsa steps out of the shadows with baby [[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]].''
|-
!Moon
|Star was just showing me around. It's really impressive, everything you've do—
|-
!Eclipsa
|[hugs Moon tightly, tearing up] Moon. Do you remember me? Do you remember what I did?
|-
!Moon
|[strained] No, not really, it's just... it's just a feeling.
|-
![[Meteora Butterfly]]
|[crying]
|-
!River
|[strained] I think you're... squishing the baby.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, no, no, no, she's fine. She only cries like this when she's got a dirty nappy. [[Manfred]]!
|-
!
|''Manfred enters, takes Meteora from Eclipsa, and walks away.''
|-
!Meteora
|[giggles]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Moon... I'm so sorry for everything that happened. I—
|-
!Moon
|Eclipsa, it's okay. Maybe it's a good thing that I can't remember.
|-
!
|''Moon and Eclipsa share a hug. Eclipsa looks over at River, who looks back at her with an angry face.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, River. Hello. Maybe you'd like to freshen up under the waterfall?
|-
!River
|Oh-ho-ho. So, now that you're queen, you think you can just boss me around?
|-
!Moon
|River, go take a bath.
|-
!River
|Yes, dear. But only because ''you'' asked me. [walks away]
|-
!Moon
|He's still processing all of this.
|-
!Eclipsa
|And Moon, my dear, how are you holding up? I know it's a lot to take in. Me running the kingdom, Meteora's a baby, and, of course, there's Globgor.
|-
!Moon
|Globgor? I feel like I-I know that name somehow.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I'll show you. Right this way!
|-
!Star
|Marco! Distraction! Now!
|-
!Marco
|What? Why me?
|-
!Star
|Marco, just do it!
|-
!
|''Marco takes a few steps backward and stumbles down a flight of stairs.''
|-
!Marco
|Aah! Aaah! [screams, falls down stairs]
|-
!
|''Moon and Eclipsa stop in front of a door and hear Marco falling off-screen.''
|-
!Marco
|[groaning]
|-
!Star
|[comes down stairs] Oh, no-no-no! Oh, my gosh! [shakes Marco] Marco, speak to me!
|-
!Marco
|You're not supposed to shake people with spinal injuries!
|-
!Star
|[shakes Marco again] You have a spinal injury?!
|-
!Marco
|No! But if I did, shaking me wouldn't help.
|-
!Star
|Marco, that stunt was totally overkill.
|-
!Star
|Actually, I slipped.
|-
!Eclipsa
|[comes down stairs] Marco! Oh, I am so sorry! We just had the stairs waxed!
|-
![[Glossaryck]]
|[falls down stairs] Whoa! Oof! Ow!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Marco, are you all right?
|-
!Star
|Okay, look, Eclipsa. I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to talk to you about this, but I think ''I'' should be the one to tell my mom about Globgor. Yeah, her memory just isn't all there yet, and this is a lot to take in. You know what I mean?
|-
!Moon
|[comes down stairs] Oh, my goodness! Marco, what happened?
|-
!Marco
|Uhhhh...
|-
!Star
|[chuckles] Oh, Mom, Marco was just so excited because he wanted to show you... Eclipsa's guitar! Eclipsa, did you know my mom plays classical guitar like a beast?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Ooh! Moon, you simply must play us a tune!
|-
!Moon
|Oh. [chuckles] I suppose one song wouldn't hurt.
|-
!
|''Moon plays a soft acoustic guitar piece on Eclipsa's bone guitar. Eclipsa, Star, and Marco stare in amazement at her talent. Cut to River bathing under a waterfall. The bugs and leaves covering his body wash away.''
|-
!River
|My sweet little angels. [sobs] Goodbye.
|-
!
|''Cut back to Eclipsa and Moon.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|That is so beyond brilliant! What if you kicked it up a little? Like... [imitating rock guitar] ♪ Eeh eeh eh eh eeh ehh! ♪
|-
!Moon
|Ah, yes, I suppose you could. Perhaps a little... [plays rock guitar riff, laughs]
|-
!Eclipsa
|[imitating rock guitar] ♪ Eeh eh eeh eh eeh! ♪
|-
!Star
|What the...?
|-
!Marco
|I need to talk to you.
|-
!Star
|Am I losing my mind? They're, like, having fun.
|-
!Marco
|That was a close one. You need to tell your mom about Globgor. She's gonna find out sooner or later. Rip that Band-Aid off!
|-
!Star
|You know what? You are right, Marco. Mom, I have something important to tell you!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[playing hard rock guitar solo]
|-
!Star
|[yells over guitar] Eclipsa! Eclipsa! ''Eclipsa!''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[stops playing] Oh, I'm sorry. I just got lost in a solo.
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa, where's my mom?
|-
!Eclipsa
|She was just here.
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, and Eclipsa run back up the stairs and enter Globgor's chamber.''
|-
!Star
|No, no, no! Mom!
|-
!
|''Moon watches monsters use pickaxes on Globgor's crystal prison.''
|-
!Moon
|The Monster King...
|-
!Star
|Uh, um, Mom, look. I wanted to tell you, but I was just afraid your brain couldn't take it.
|-
!Moon
|You know, Eclipsa, torches and chisels won't do anything to [[Rhombulus]]' magic.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I know. But I just couldn't stand the sight of my love just sitting there, trapped, without doing something.
|-
!Moon
|I understand. Being separated from the ones you love is a terrible thing.
|-
!Star
|Marco, what's happening? She's being... so reasonable.
|-
!Marco
|[whispering] I know! I told you she would be.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Thank you for being so understanding. That means a lot to me.
|-
!Archibald
|Eclipsa? Can... can I blow the horn now?
|-
!Eclipsa
|I suppose it is time. Yes, please.
|-
!Archibald
|[plays trumpet out of tune] Dinner is served!
|-
!
|''Star, Marco, Moon, River, Eclipsa, and several monsters have dinner together near Globgor's crystal.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|You'll never guess what Meteora tried to eat today.
|-
!Wolf monster
|Ah, here you are. Open up, darling. [feeds bird monster]
|-
!Bird monster
|[squawking]
|-
!River
|What kind of barbarian eats roots and leaves for dinner?
|-
!Glossaryck
|[dives into bowl of pudding] The things you miss when you're dead.
|-
!River
|[pounds dinner table] Confound it! That was the only vegetable worth eating!
|-
!Moon
|[chuckles]
|-
!Eclipsa
|300 years later, and he's still the same little scamp.
|-
!Moon and Eclipsa
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''Meteora crawls across the table.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|Hello, infant!
|-
!Meteora
|[babbles, picks up Glossaryck and sucks on his forehead crystal]
|-
!Glossaryck
|Wow! Somebody's teeth grew in fast!
|-
!Moon
|Star did the same thing when she was a baby.
|-
!Eclipsa
|[laughs] Babies do the darnedest things!
|-
!Moon
|Star also used to wear her diapers as a crown. [laughs] Can you imagine?
|-
!Marco
|[laughs] Really?
|-
!Star
|At least I didn't wear a meat blanket for a month.
|-
!Bird monster
|[choking, retches up food, looks at Marco]
|-
!Marco
|Uh, hey, Star, can we maybe move seat—?
|-
!Star
|[staring straight ahead]
|-
!Marco
|Hey, are you okay?
|-
!
|''Soft music plays over Moon and Eclipsa's friendly dinner conversation.''
|-
!Star
|[teary-eyed] I'm perfect.
|-
!Moon
|[stands up] Eclipsa, thank you so much for a wonderful evening. Unfortunately, I must be going now.
|-
!Star and Eclipsa
|[surprised look]
|-
!Moon
|[leaving the room] River.
|-
!River
|Yes, dear! [to dinner plate] I never liked you. [follows Moon]
|-
!Star
|[to Eclipsa] Uh, he was talking about the broccoli.
|-
!
|''Cut to Monster Temple exterior; Moon and River leave together.''
|-
!Star
|[comes out of the temple] Whoa-whoa-whoa, Mom! Wait! Where are you going?
|-
!Moon
|Your father and I are going to take off.
|-
!Star
|Oh, it was the Globgor thing, wasn't it? Ugh! I know I should've told you earlier.
|-
!Moon
|No, it's... it's not Globgor. It's Eclipsa.
|-
!Star
|W-What? You guys looked like buds. You were jamming back there.
|-
!Moon
|I don't trust her.
|-
!Star
|I guess you don't think I made the right decision then.
|-
!Moon
|Look, you were queen, and you made a decision. I may not think it was the right decision, but that doesn't matter.
|-
!Star
|Well, so what are you gonna do?
|-
!Moon
|Your dad and I need some time alone together, and he wants to build something called a... yurt?
|-
!Star
|A what?
|-
!River
|A yurt, my dear. It's like a tent, but round! I got the plans right here. [unrolls scroll of yurt diagram] I'm going to use my saliva to bind the logs together.
|-
!Star
|That... doesn't sound safe.
|-
!Moon
|Yes, it sounds pretty dangerous. Sure you don't want to come with us?
|-
!Star
|I feel like I gotta stay here and help Eclipsa figure this out.
|-
!Moon
|[hugs Star] I love you, sweetie.
|-
!Star
|[tearing up] I-I love you, too.
|-
!
|''Moon and River walk away. Marco appears next to Star and puts his hand on her shoulder.''
|-
!Marco
|You okay?
|-
!Star
|Just kinda feel so grown up.
