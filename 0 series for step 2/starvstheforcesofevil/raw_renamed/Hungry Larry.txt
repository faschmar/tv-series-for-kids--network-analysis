|''Episode begins at the [[Diaz Household]], Halloween night. [[Rafael Diaz]] slowly opens the door, weak light on his face.''
|-
![[Rafael Diaz]]
|(tries to sound creepy) Oh. Hello, children.
|-
!Kid #2
|Uh... hey.
|-
!Rafael
|(looks around, still tries being creepy) You should be at home with the door locked.
|-
!Kid #1
|We're here for your... to see your haunted house.
|-
!Rafael
|But this is the most dangerous place to be.
|-
!
|''Kid #1 sniffs, [[Marco Diaz]] looking down at the children.''
|-
!Rafael
|Well, then, step inside... (zoom at his face) at your peril.
|-
!Kid #1
|(to Marco) Is this a joke?
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Just remember our deal. (pushes children inside the house)
|-
!Rafael
|Perhaps you are more brave than smart. Or perhaps you are just like me. (looks closely at Kid #3) Perhaps you too have sympathy for the monster.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, boy.
|-
!
|''[[Star Butterfly]] and [[Janna Ordonia]] looking from the stairs at Rafael, then at each other. [[Angie Diaz]] plays creepy music.''
|-
!Rafael
|But beware.
|-
![[Angie Diaz]]
|(gasps)
|-
!Rafael
|Do not do what I have done. (pushes the red button) You must never let the monster inside.
|-
!Kid #1
|(looks at Marco) I can't do this. Can you turn on the lights, please?
|-
!
|''Music stops, lights are on.''
|-
!Kid #1
|Look, man, you seem like a nice guy, and I wanna be scared - I really do. But the truth is, I'm eight. That's like 90 years old in Halloween years. (points at his friends) Next year, we might not even be afraid of monsters. I don't wanna waste my time. (children leave from the couch) I'm sorry. You're just not scary.
|-
!Rafael
|(sad) I'm not scary?
|-
!Kid #2
|(leaving the house) Come on, guys. Let's go to a real haunted house.
|-
!Marco
|(whispering after them) We had a deal, remember? (pulls out the money)
|-
!
|''Marco, Janna and Star are looking at Rafael.''
|-
!Rafael
|(groans, carrying the Frankenstein doll which is grunting) Okay. Halloween is over. Janna and Star need to go home now. (laughs)
|-
!Marco
|Dad, Star lives here.
|-
!Rafael
|(laughs) Yes, Marco. It doesn't always have to be an argument. Sometimes we just do what daddy says. (kicks the Frankenstein doll, then tries to pull it out of the house) Now, if anybody needs me, I'll be in the shed.
|-
!Marco
|He does it every year and it makes him miserable.
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Okay, so what do we do?
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
|Oh, I got it. Let's go to that other haunted house down the street and just ditch this one.
|-
!Marco
|What? No. You're missing the point. How do we make my dad's haunted house scary?
|-
!Star
|We can always summon [[Hungry Larry (character)|Hungry Larry]].
|-
!Marco
|Uhh... Who?
|-
!Star
|Oh, Hungry Larry. You know, you summon him, he comes and haunts your house. I've heard he's a real creep. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
|-
!Marco
|(facepalm) We're not summoning... anyone. (looks at his friends) We're not summoning... ugh! (facepalm) I can't believe I even have to have this conversation with you. (goes out of the house)
|-
!Star
|(pointing at him) Where are you going?
|-
!Marco
|(from the door) I'm gonna go bribe some five-year-olds. Maybe they'll think my dad's scary. (closes the door, then opens them again) No summoning. (closes them again)
|-
!
|''Star's room, lights are off. Janna and Star are sitting on the floor.''
|-
!Star
|Okay, it says here, (reads) "If Hungry Larry is the haunt you need, do these actions and you'll succeed. A lick of mustard you must bear, off an old takeout menu if you dare."
|-
!Janna
|(puts mustard on an old takeout menu from Emilio's Pizza) Alright, done.
|-
!Star
|(reads again) "Then three times his name is said. Arrive he does with scares and dread."
|-
!
|''Janna and Star lick the menu.''
|-
!Janna and Star
|Hungry Larry. (the clouds hide the moon) Hungry Larry. Hungry Larry.
|-
!
|''The girls hear a knocking at the door. They go downstairs, afraid to open the door.''
|-
!Hungry Larry
|Star Butterfly? (reads) You summoned me. (Star looks at him) Can I come in or what?
|-
!Janna
|Star, invite him in.
|-
!Star
|Please, come on in.
|-
!
|''Outside the house, Angie carries a bowl of candy corn.''
|-
!Angie
|(knocks to shed's door) Honey, I know you're probably totally humiliated, that you wrestled that blow-up doll in front of your son and his friends. But everyone inside loves you. (points at the house)(sighs and leaves a bowl) There's a bowl of candy corn for you out here on the porch. Don't step on it. (Rafael looks from the window) Rafael, I can see you in the window! (Rafael covers the blinds)
|-
!
|''Star's room. Janna and Star are looking at Hungry Larry who is searching for something in his suitcase, not interested in what the girls are saying.''
|-
!Star
|So, basically, we just need the house to be, like, super scary. Mr. Diaz hasn't scared a single kid all night. Actually, I don't know if he's ever scared a single kid ever. (Hungry Larry measures the room) But Janna and I are very handy, so how can we help? (no response, Larry practices scary noises) Larry? Larry, watcha doing?
|-
!Hungry Larry
|Oh, you guys are still here?
|-
!Janna
|We're not guys.
|-
!Hungry Larry
|Cool. Can you leave?
|-
!Star
|(leaving with Janna from her room) Uh, yeah, yeah. Okay, fine. You're working. I get it.
|-
!Hungry Larry
|You guys are still here? (closes the door)
|-
!
|''Star and Janna are sitting on the stairs.''
|-
!Janna
|Ow, that guy isn't scary. He's creepy.
|-
!Star
|(sighs) Bummer. I really just wanted Mr. D to have his haunted house.
|-
!Janna
|Eh, even if you did give him a haunted house, that wouldn't make Mr. Diaz scary.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, maybe not. But at least it'd be something. Should we just call it off?
|-
!Janna
|You mean fire Hungry Larry?
|-
!Star
|I guess.
|-
!Janna
|Oh, can I fire him?
|-
!Star
|Go for it.
|-
!Janna
|Yes! (runs upstairs)
|-
!Star
|Poor Mr. Diaz. (hears Janna scream, stands up)
|-
!
|''Janna's scream is heard on the street, catching everybody's attention.''
|-
!Marco
|(runs into the house) Star, what was that?
|-
!Star
|Uh, I think it was Janna. (scratches her back)(doorbell rings, Marco goes open it) Wow.
|-
!Kid #4
|Hey, did that scream come from inside of this haunted house?
|-
!Marco
|Uh...
|-
!Star
|Yes. Welcome, kids to the Diaz House of Horror!
|-
!
|Children are cheering and running into the house.
|-
!Marco
|Star, seriously. What is going on?
|-
!Star
|Okay, Marco, I know you said no summoning, but we summoned. We summoned Hungry Larry.
|-
!Marco
|(gasps)(children scream) You what?! (tries to run upstairs but Star stops him)
|-
!Star
|Oh, chill, Marco. Everyone's having a great time. Can't you hear all those bloodcurdling screams? (screams fades away)
|-
!Marco
|I don't hear anything, Star.
|-
!
|''Star opens the door to her room, weird liquid is spread all around the damaged room.''
|-
!Marco
|(grabs a lollipop from the ground) Candy.
|-
!Star
|Uh, no duh. It's Halloween. (touches the liquid and licks it) This is saliva.
|-
!
|''More saliva pours out under Star's bed.''
|-
!Star
|(confused/scared) Hungry Larry?
|-
!
|''Three kids show up under Star's bed, terrified. Marco screams and falls on Star.''
|-
!Star
|(comes to them)(summoning light from her wand) Where's Hungry Larry?
|-
!Kid #1
|(terrified) He's... still... hungry. (gasp)
|-
!
|''Something sucks the kid under the bed and then his friends. The door suddenly closes.''
|-
!Voices of the kids
|(echo) I'm still hungry.
|-
!Star
|What the...? (terrified) Hungry for what? (something pulls Marco out)(gasp) Marco! (splashing)
|-
!Voices of the kids
|(whispering) I'm still hungry... (voices echoing)
|-
!
|''Star looks up - saliva pours from the walls and then red eyes are seen. Star is looking at them confused.''
|-
!Voice of a girl
|I'm still...
|-
!Voices of the kids
|...hungry.
|-
!
|''Hungry Larry slowly shows up with open mouth and saliva spread all over his face. Then he suddenly comes down and terrified, Star screams.''
|-
!
|''At the shed, loud metal music plays. Rafael turns on the wood chipper and puts a mask on. He tries to destroy the Frankenstein doll but it bounces away and pushes the radio off the table.''
|-
!Rafael 
|(runs after it) Oh, no, no, no. (the doll bounces away)
|-
!
|''Rafael is sad, then looks down and picks up one piece of candy corn.''
|-
!Rafael 
|(inside the house) Honey, I'm... sorry. I thought this year was going to be different. (no response) Honey? (walks through the house) Kids? (looks at the keyboard, starts to play) Marco, Marco, Marc... oh! (liquid drops on his hand)
|-
!
|''Rafael looks at his hand, and then at the ceiling which is wet.''
|-
!Rafael
|(confused) Wet ceiling? (enters Star's room)(gasps) Oh! Kids.
|-
!Scary voices
|They're in here.
|-
!
|''Hungry Larry shows up. He's much bigger than he was and he flies down to Rafael.''
|-
!Rafael
|(scared) Who are you?
|-
!Hungry Larry
|(many voices) I'm Hungry... (clears throat)(one voice) I'm Hungry Larry. (candies and saliva flow from his mouth) I've been summoned here to haunt your home because you're not scary.
|-
!Rafael
|(terrified) But where is my family?
|-
!Hungry Larry
|I told you. (opens his mouth wider) They're in... here.
|-
!
|''Children, Star, Marco and Janna scream for help inside Hungry Larry's stomach.''
|-
!Children
|Help!
|-
!Marco
|Dad, get us out of here!
|-
!Rafael
|(gasps) Kids!
|-
!Hungry Larry
|Oh, your wife is in here, too. (looks around) Um, uh, somewhere. She's pretty.
|-
!Rafael
|Oh. Thank you?
|-
!Hungry Larry
|(points at Rafael) I would eat you too, but I'm stuffed. (pats his stomach) So, uh, count your blessings. I guess.
|-
!Rafael
|(sad) But my family is my blessings.
|-
!Hungry Larry
|Oh. What I meant to say was, (screams) ''get out''!
|-
!
|''Candies and saliva pours out Hungry Larry's face and it knocks down Rafael. He notices a candy corn, grabs it and then gets up.''
|-
!Rafael
|Give me back my (screams) ''family''!
|-
!Hungry Larry
|(confused, gasps)
|-
!
|''Rafael jumps on Hungry Larry and then inside his mouth but he spits him out. Rafael gets up again and once again jumps inside Hungry Larry's mouth. In his stomach everything's dark but then it brightens and Rafael shows up with lollipops in his eyes and saliva all over his body. Terrified by Rafael, the children start to scream louder. Finally, Rafael pushes himself into Hungry Larry's stomach which causes him to regurgitate everybody he ate and some kids are cheering.''
|-
!Rafael
|(lands on his back) Ugh.
|-
!Marco and Star
|(lands on their backs) Oh.
|-
!Angie
|(lands on the floor) Ah.
|-
!
|''Rafael, Angie, Star and Marco look at each other and then hug.''
|-
!All
|Aww!
|-
!Janna
|Mr. Diaz! (excited) You were terrifying in there!
|-
!
|''Children cheering.''
|-
!Kid #1
|Best Halloween ever!
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, Dad, that was amazing.
|-
!
|''Rafael smiles, then Hungry Larry shows up again.''
|-
!Hungry Larry
|It's like I always say. Nothing more terrifying than a man who's lost everything.
|-
!Rafael
|(serious angry look) Leave this place.
|-
!Hungry Larry
|(leaves and gets into the cab) How rude. Whatever.
|-
!
|''The cab flies away and the episode ends.''
