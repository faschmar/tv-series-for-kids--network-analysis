| ''Scene opens inside Star's wand. [[Spider With a Top Hat|Spider with a Top Hat]] sticks a spile into a Stump Day stump and extracts some fluid into a punch bowl. Scene changes to some pastries in the oven.''
|-
!Spider
| Perfect! [grabs tray] Ow! Hot! Hot! Hot!
|-
!
| ''He runs the hot tray over as fast as he can; on the return trip he pushes the stump across the room. He then runs back across, holding 13 stump mugs.''
|-
!Spider
| Steady, steady. Ooh, steady.
|-
!
| ''Scene changes to Spider's checklist. He marks off the last few items.''
|-
!Spider
| All right. Looks like everything is going to be A-O... [hears something dripping] oh, oh, no! The chocolate fountain!
|-
!
| ''He runs away while yelling, grabs a plunger, and plunges the fountain until a large geyser of chocolate erupts, which sends him flying. The fountain's now working and the scene changes to a hallway. Flying Pig positions a stump wreath on a door.''
|-
!Spider
| Up high!
|-
!Pig
| You mean [high-fiving spider] down low?
|-
!Spider
| [laughs] Because I'm short.
|-
!
| ''The All-Seeing Eye opens the door, and the wreath falls. It looks at the wreath.''
|-
!Spider
| Oh, let me get that for you. [throws it onto the door] Hey, you're the new guy. Uh, Seeing Eye spell, right?
|-
!Eye
| [hums]
|-
!Spider
| You settling in okay?
|-
!Eye
| [hums]
|-
!Spider
| Fantastic. Well, [points to his eye] I'll see you at the party later. [laughs] I jokes.
|-
!
| ''Scene changes to some purple goats who are spitting out snowflake decorations.''
|-
!Goats
| [bleat]
|-
!Spider
| Well, if it isn't the goats with the moats. Uh, most. These are beautiful. Keep up the good work. Bye.
|-
!Goats
| [bleat]
|-
!
| ''The All-seeing eye walks in. The goats stop. Scene changes to the dish washroom. Raccoon is washing a cookie. Spider comes flying in on a silk thread.''
|-
!Spider
| Hey, Raccoon. Thanks for washing those... uh... cookies. But, maybe you could wash the fine china instead.
|-
!Raccoon
| [eats cookie, starts washing a plate]
|-
!Spider
| Thanks, buddy. Spider out!
|-
!
| ''Spider's flies out on a silk thread again. The All-Seeing Eye comes in, and Raccoon stops washing the plate. Scene changes to two warnicorns and narwhal who are stacked on top of each other. Narwhal positions a red ribbon up top.''
|-
!Spider
| Hey, Narwhal, looks pretty good.
|-
!Narwhal
| Thanks, Spider. [whispering] But there's something I need to talk to you about.
|-
!Spider
| Okay. What?
|-
!Narwhal
| Well, I...
|-
!Bottom Warnicorn
| [groans] Narwhal, please.
|-
!Narwhal
| Oh, dismount.
|-
!
| ''The three unstack.''
|-
!Bottom Narwhal
| Next time, you're the foundation.
|-
!Spider
| So what's up?
|-
!Narwhal
| [sees All-Seeing Eye] Let's go somewhere a little quieter to talk. [grabs Spider]
|-
!Spider
| What? Is... something wrong?
|-
!Narwhal
| It's Seeing Eye. He's really creepy.
|-
!Spider
| What? What are you talking about? He's fine. Plus, spying is kind of his job.
|-
!Crystal Muffin
| Then can we fire him?
|-
!Warnicorn
| He's seriously harshing our mellow.
|-
!Spider
| Well what do you want me to do? [laughs] Uninvite him from the Stump Day party?
|-
!
| ''The crowd voices their approval at that idea.''
|-
!Spider
| I can't do that. Stump Day is about inclusiveness and love, [sinister] and not angering the Stump.
|-
!Beanbag
| But Stump Day is the one day of the year I get to cut loose and guzzle beans. How can I do that with Spy Eye buzzin' around?
|-
!Snail
| Yeah, let him eat the beans.
|-
!Pig
| Spy Eye is not even one of Star's spells.
|-
!Other Narwhal
| Yeah, he's from Eclipsa.
|-
!Spider
| Well but Star used him, and he's one of us now.
|-
!Warnicorn
| Spy Eye is definitely not one of my bros.
|-
!Spider
| Hey, come on, guys. We all have our quirks, right? Narwhal, you're always breaking pillars around the house with your blast ever since I can remember. And Snail, ugh, you leave your gross snail trails everywhere.
|-
!Snail
| It's a side effect from my medication.
|-
!Spider
| And me, me, I've got a laser cannon in my hat. [laughs] Look, Seeing Eye's just part of our family now, and you guys need to give him the same consideration that you give each other. Now, let's have a wonderful Stump Day.
|-
!Narwhal
| Yeah! What do you say, guys? Maybe Spider has a point.
|-
!
| ''The spells reluctantly agree. Scene changes to the beginning of the party in the main room.''
|-
!Spider
| Hey, hey, ya old Stump. Glad you could make it.
|-
!Minotaur
| Merry Stump Day. Whoo! Stump Day!
|-
!Spider
| Merry Stump Day to you.
|-
!Snail
| Whoa, you really outdid yourself.
|-
!Spider
| Merry Stump Day, Snail. Cloudy, I'm liking the upgrade.
|-
!
| ''Scene changes to later; Spider spindles down from the ceiling with a tray of pastries.''
|-
!Spider
| Hey, guys, can I interest anyone in some fresh-baked Stump cakes?
|-
!Minotaur
| Ooh!
|-
!Pig
| My favorite.
|-
!Minotaur
| Hey, Spider, hit me up. [eats the pastry Spider throws into his mouth] That's what a Stump should taste like.
|-
!
| ''Scene changes to the punch bowl.''
|-
!Spider
| [to Warnicorn] Here you go, fresh from the Stump.
|-
!
| ''Scene changes to Squirrel playing "Pin the stick on the stump". Squirrel pins the stick.''
|-
!Squirrel
| Did I get it? Did I pin the twig on the stump?
|-
!Spider
| Oh, you sure did. Way to stick it to him.
|-
!Narwhal
| Great party, Spider. Everyone's havin' a great time.
|-
!
| ''Spider looks around at all the happy party goers. He notices All-Seeing Eye by itself.''
|-
!Spider
| Well that's not right! [walks through the crowd] Excuse me. Pardon me. Hey, Seeing Eye, good to see ya, buddy. You havin' fun over here in the corner, by yourself?
|-
!Eye
| [hums]
|-
!Spider
| You know what? Why don't I introduce you to some of the other spells, huh? Sound fun? Come on.
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps to Flying Pig.''
|-
!Pig
| So then I said, "Forget about flying. You ever seen a pig do this?" [dances, silence] I'm dancin'.
|-
!
| ''The others around Flying Pig laugh''
|-
!Makeup Blast
| Oh that's what he was doing.
|-
!Spider
| Good one. Hey, speaking of cool, funny things, have you guys met Seeing Eye? Yeah, he's a new spell that Star's been using a lot lately and is an all-around great guy.
|-
!
| '' They all fall silent.''
|-
!Spider
| [nervous laugh] Anyhoo, Seeing Eye, now I could tell you some stories about these crazy guys [laughs].
|-
!
| ''The All-Seeing Eye blinks, and in the eye, a scene from earlier in the party plays.''
|-
!Squirrel
| Tell me about it.
|-
!Kitten Barrel
| [behind Squirrel] Achoo! [blows nose into Squirrel's tail]
|-
!
| ''The All-Seeing Eye blinks again, revealing more events from earlier. Makeup Blast''
|-
!Makeup Blast
| [licks pastry] Nah. [licks another] Nah. [likes a third] Nah. [licks a fourth]
|-
!
| ''All-Seeing Eye blinks. The others look angrily at Makeup Blast. All-Seeing Eye reveals another event.''
|-
!Squid
| [flies by office supplies] Cool. Free stuff. [burns it with blue fire]
|-
!
| ''All-Seeing Eye blinks again. Flying Pig is at the punch bowl; he throws his head into it and slurps up the majority of the punch, spitting some back into his cup.''
|-
!Pig
| Oh, there you go.
|-
!Eye
| [blinks open]
|-
!Makeup Blast
| That's disgusting.
|-
!Pig
| Whatever. You're the one licking the cupcakes.
|-
!Kitten Barrel
| You put your head in the punch.
|-
!Squid
| Not cool.
|-
!
| ''They all march off bickering.''
|-
!Spider
| [nervous laugh] Well I, I guess he already knows all of you.
|-
!Gray Warnicorn
| Hey, do you lift? 'Cause, you know, it's a... it's a pretty big deal around here, as you can tell by my body. [flexes]
|-
!
| ''The Eye turns to the other Warnicorns and reveals a scene of him putting on a fake muscle suit.''
|-
!Other Warnicorns
| [gasp]
|-
!Gray Warnicorn
| [gulp]
|-
!Green Warnicorn
| You totally lied to us, bro.
|-
!Blue Warnicorn
| You broke a sacred sweaty bond.
|-
!Gray Warnicorn
| Hold on a second, guys, don't be mad.
|-
!Blue Warnicorn
| I'm not mad, [sniffles] I just need some time to process.
|-
!Green Warnicorn
| Yeah, me, too, bro. [tears up] We have to go. [trots away]
|-
!Gray Warnicorn
| Wait, bros, no! Aghhh! All right, [to Eye] You know what? No. No. This is your fault. All right. Instead of taking responsibility for my actions, I am gonna blame you for recording them, and then I am gonna pummel you.
|-
!
| ''Spider jumps on top of Gray Warnicorn.''
|-
!Spider
| The, uh, Stump cakes you were looking for, they're over there. [laughs]
|-
!Warnicorn
| Fine. I'll be back momentarily to whoop your... eye, I guess. [trots away]
|-
!Spider
| Seeing Eye, what are you doing?
|-
!
| ''The Eye blinks, revealing a scene of Marco Diaz and Jackie Lynn Thomas''
|-
!Marco
| It's always best to tell the truth.
|-
!Spider
| Yes. Be that as it may, we are at an office Stump Day party.
|-
!Eye
| [hums]
|-
!Spider
| Ugh! Look, just try havin' some fun, okay?
|-
!
| ''All-Seeing Eye floats off into the crowd. It wanders by multiple groups of people, but ultimately doesn't find a place to join.''
|-
!Spider
| No.
|-
!Narwhal
| [puts down cup] How's it goin'?
|-
!Spider
| This is a nightmare. [dumps his head in the cup] You know what? I'd like to tell every spell at this stupid, stinkin' Stump Day party that they stink. Ruining Stump Day after all the hard work...
|-
!Narwhal
| [whispering] Spider.
|-
!Spider
| What?! I'm trying to wallow.
|-
!Narwhal
| That.
|-
!
| ''Narwhal gestures towards All-Seeing Eye, whose gaze is focused right on Spider.''
|-
!Spider
| Maybe he didn't hear us. Let's just start dinner, and get this whole thing over with.
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps to dinner at the main stump. Spider taps a fork against a stump mug.''
|-
!Spider
| Attention, please. [unenthusiastically] Friends, we made it another year, and now we have this beautiful feast...
|-
!Pig
| Licked by a raccoon.
|-
!Snail
| Blecchh!
|-
!Spider
| ...to enjoy together as a...
|-
!
| ''Spider pauses, gazing upon all the spells. He begins to tear up.''
|-
!Spider
| ...as a family. [smiles]
|-
!Makeup Blast
| Without any punch, 'cause a certain pig drank it all.
|-
!Spider
| You know what? Pig did drink all the punch.
|-
!Pig
| Hey.
|-
!Spider
| And Makeup Blast licked our food, and Raccoon, he washed our cookies.
|-
!Warnicorn
| [disgusted snort]
|-
!Spider
| While Seeing Eye is creepin' everybody out. But it's his first Stump Day, guys, and you know what? Where I come from, that counts for something, right?
|-
!Warnicrons
| [bro-hoof] Oh, yeah, that's true. [hug each other]
|-
!Gray Warnicorn
| Yeah, let's hear it for Spider, man! He's the glue that holds us together.
|-
!All
| To Spider! To Spider!
|-
!
| ''The All-Seeing Eye reveals Spider's earlier statement''
|-
!Spider
| You know what? I'd like to tell every spell at this stupid, stinkin' Stump Day party that they stink!
|-
!All
| [gasp]
|-
!Gray Warnicorn
| Is that... how you feel?
|-
!Spider
| [agape]
|-
!
| ''Everyone begins talking, they all leave the table, and head back to their rooms besides Spider and All-Seeing Eye.''
|-
!Spider
| Well yeah... but no... my exact... the meaning of what I, uh was saying... Oh. [angrily, to Eye] What the heck, man?
|-
!
| ''Eye blinks''
|-
!Marco
| It's always best to tell the truth.
|-
!Spider
| Whatever, man. I hope you're happy. We were a family, and you could have been a part of it. But now! Now, it's over! And and, if I never see you again, well, it would be fine with me. [storms off]
|-
!
| ''All-Seeing Eye is alone on the table. As Spider walks to his room, Eye reveals another scene.''
|-
!Pig
| Oh, Stump cakes. Oh, excuse me.
|-
!Squirrel
| Your hand is really soft.
|-
!Spider
| What?
|-
!Eye
| [blinks]
|-
!Narwhal
| Tell me about it.
|-
!
| ''Squid drops a stump bucket on his head''
|-
!Narwhal
| What? Oh.
|-
!Narwhal and Squid
| [laugh]
|-
!Eye
| [blinks]
|-
!
| ''Makeup Blast and Beanbag pour punch into Kitten Barrel. As the scene plays, other spells come out of their rooms to watch. Eye blinks; Kitten Barrel is dumping punch onto Minotaur. Narwhal, Squid, Kitten Barrel, and Minotaur all laugh.''
|-
!Minotaur
| [laughs] Oh, yeah, I did do that, didn't I?
|-
!Kitten Barrel
| [laughs] You did do that, didn't you?
|-
!Eye
| [blinks]
|-
!Spider
| [to Warnicorn] Let me get your jacket.
|-
!Warnicorn
| Why, thank you, Spider.
|-
!Eye
| [blinks]
|-
!
| ''In the scene, Spider laughs as he runs around with a wreath.''
|-
!Green Warnicorn
| Dude is such a gentleman.
|-
!Pig
| I didn't realize how hard he worked.
|-
!Marco
| [in Eye] It's always best to tell the truth.
|-
!Eye
| [blinks, opens]
|-
!Spider
| [eyes sparkling] Wow. Thank you, Seeing Eye.
|-
!Gray Warnicorn
| Aw, dude [hugs Eye] that was beautiful, man. Come on, bring it in. You're all right, bro.
|-
!
| ''All the spells re-gather.''
|-
!Spider
| [teary-eyed] It's a Stump Day miracle.
|-
!Gray Warnicorn
| [laughs] Sure is. Come on, guys, we got a Stump Day to celebrate.
|-
!Spider
| Really?
|-
!Narwhal
| Ha ha, you know it buddy!
|-
!Spider
| Come on, Seeing Eye. Let's get this party started!
