|''Episode begins in [[Mewni]]'s Garbage Island. [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]] and [[Janna Ordonia|Janna]] are on the beach. Tom is texting on his mirror phone. Janna shields her eyes from the sun.''
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|[texting throughout] J-Janna, um... Hold on one second. Let me get this. Uh... okay. Um, I just wanted to say that I— Oh. I... I wanted to say... thaaaa... thank you for bringing me along on your, uh...
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
|[looks at the fourth wall]
|-
!Tom
|You know, I just... I don't know what to do with myself when [[Star Butterfly|Star]] is, um... Hold on, I got to... You know, when... when she's at one of her meetings. [chuckles] It's what it's like being in a serious relationship.
|-
!Janna
|[walks away] Whatever.
|-
!Tom
|[continues texting]
|-
!
|''Janna climbs on top of a large pile of garbage and finds something under a tarp.''
|-
!Janna
|It's on.
|-
!
|''Janna pulls the tarp away, revealing a giant metal boot.''
|-
!Janna
|Yeah, baby!
|-
!
|''Tom floats up to Janna's side and continues texting on his phone. His phone suddenly vibrates.''
|-
!Tom
|Oh. I got a call. [puts phone to his ear] Hello?
|-
!Janna
|[speaking into her phone] You know, if you really want to have a life when you're away from Star, you might want to get off your phone. [turns phone off]
|-
!Tom
|Oh. Yes, yes. Of course, right. I am here. Present and accounted for.
|-
!Janna
|Now... Tom, hop in the boot.
|-
!Tom
|Ta-da! [jumps into the boot] So, what exactly are we doing?
|-
!Janna
|Boot sledding.
|-
!Tom
|Wait, wait, wait. What?
|-
!
|''Janna pushes the boot toward the edge of the hill and jumps inside with Tom. The boot falls over the hill and slides downward the steep incline.''
|-
!Tom
|[screams]
|-
!Janna
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''The boot bounces off a piece of sheet metal and flips through the air, with Tom screaming and Janna laughing the whole time. The boot comes to a stop at the bottom of the hill.''
|-
!Tom
|[panting] Okay. Hey, you know what? That was, uh... That was actually kind of fun.
|-
!Janna
|Yeah, it was. Come on, let's push this thing to the top.
|-
!Tom
|Wait, wait. One quick selfie for Star first. [opens his phone]
|-
!Janna
|[annoyed] Yeah, okay.
|-
!
|''Tom takes a selfie with his phone. Scene cuts to the Bureaucracy of Magic; Star and [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]] are standing in the waiting room.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|[using her phone, giggles] Oh, Tom.
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|[tapping her foot] This is so typical of the [[Magic High Commission|Magical High Commission]]. They tell me it's urgent, and then leave us waiting for 45 minutes. And there isn't even a place to sit down.
|-
!Star
|Mm-hmm. Total power move.
|-
!Eclipsa
|[[Sean]]!
|-
![[Sean]]
|[pops up behind security desk] Yes, ma'am! Would you like me to play you another song? [blows trumpet off-key]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, good heavens, no. Uh, please inform the Magic High Commission that I shall return on a day that they aren't so busy. Now come along, Star.
|-
!Sean
|Uh, you should at least stay to... taste my donuts! [holding a plate of donuts]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, Sean, how very thoughtful. But I have a very serious gluten aller—
|-
!Sean
|They're gluten-free.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I also must avoid all dairy—
|-
!Sean
|No cows were used in the making of these donuts.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Salt.
|-
!Sean
|Sodium-free.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Molasses.
|-
!Sean
|Nope.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Guar gum?
|-
!Sean
|Negatory.
|-
!Star
|Oh, yummy! Sounds great, Sean. [whispers to Eclipsa] Just try one so we can get out of here.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I can hardly wait. [gives a donut to Star] One for you, and one for me, darling. Cheers.
|-
!Sean
|They're made with love.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Goody. [takes bite out of donut, hacks and burps]
|-
!Sean
|How much do you love it?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[eyes watering] Oh, Sean...! [groaning]
|-
!
|''Star stuffs her donut in her pocket.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[gulps] Full of... flavors.
|-
!Star
|[pats her stomach] Mm-hmm, yeah. That was good, Sean.
|-
!Sean
|Oh, I'm so glad. Have another!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[distressed] Oh, dear...
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to Garbage Island; Tom, Janna, and the giant boot are back at the top of the garbage hill.''
|-
!Tom
|Wow! Boot sledding! So much more fun than I thought it would be.
|-
!Janna
|That's what I've been saying. If you want to have your own life when Star's not around, you got to—
|-
!
|''A crow flying overhead suddenly caws.''
|-
!Janna
|[narrows her eyes] Okay, here we go. [climbs into the boot] Tom, see that crow? Blast it.
|-
!Tom
|Wait. W-Why? Why?
|-
!Janna
|'Cause every time I find an awesome sled like this, he comes and takes it.
|-
!Tom
|Uh, no. I'm not just going to blast some innocent bird.
|-
!Janna
|[wiggles Tom's arms] Come on. Demon blast! Pew-pew!
|-
!Tom
|[shoves Janna away] Stop it! No way that's happening!
|-
!Janna
|Ugh! Then why'd I even bring you?
|-
!Tom
|Hold on. Is this why you brought me here today? To blast a harmless bird?
|-
!Janna
|We all have a purpose, Tom.
|-
!Tom
|[looks hurt] Ouch.
|-
!
|''The crow flies down and scratches the back of Tom's head.''
|-
!Tom
|Ow! Hey!
|-
!Janna
|See? That's the kind of behavior I'm talking about. Blast him!
|-
!Tom
|For the hundredth time, I'm not gonna blast a bird!
|-
!
|''The crow flies high into the sky, then menacingly swoops down at Tom and Janna.''
|-
!Janna
|Oh, no, no. Go, go, go, go, go!
|-
!Tom
|Wait! What are you—?
|-
!
|''Janna nudges the boot over the hill's edge, and it falls, with the crow chasing after.''
|-
!Tom and Janna
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''The boot crashes at the bottom of the hill.''
|-
!Janna
|[crawls out of the boot, sighs]
|-
!Tom
|[panting] Okay.
|-
!Janna
|Ugh. Why didn't you blast him when you had the chance?
|-
!Tom
|Okay, look. I was having fun until you asked me to blast a harmless animal. And now, honestly, I'm... I'm starting to have regrets that I even came. [pouts and takes a selfie]
|-
!Janna
|What are you doing?
|-
!Tom
|Taking a "sad face" selfie. I want to share this disappointment with Star.
|-
!
|''Janna grabs Tom's phone and tosses it into the boot.''
|-
!Tom
|Hey! That's my compact!
|-
!
|''The crow lands on top of the boot, gives an odd hissing sound, and starts carrying it away in its claws.''
|-
!Janna
|You come back here with my boot!
|-
!
|''Janna grabs the bottom of the boot, and the crow carries both the boot and Janna into the sky. Scene cuts back to the Bureaucracy of Magic; Star has dozens of donuts stuffed into her pockets, and Eclipsa is green in the face with indigestion.''
|-
!Sean
|Since you liked all of those so much, you're just going to love my donut burger. It's a family recipe, going back to my great-great-grandmother Millie. She took a donut and a burger and made them one.
|-
!
|''The door opens, and [[Rhombulus]], [[Hekapoo]], and [[Omnitraxus Prime]] enter.''
|-
![[Rhombulus]]
|Looked like a turnip with a feather stuck in it.
|-
![[Hekapoo]]
|No way!
|-
![[Omnitraxus Prime]]
|[laughing]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh. How lovely— [gulps] —of you to join us.
|-
!
|''Star, Eclipsa, and the High Commission enter the meeting room.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|I apologize for keeping you waiting, but we had urgent matters to attend to.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Hmm. Urgent matters? At the Corn Shake Shack?
|-
!
|''Rhombulus and Omnitraxus Prime are sipping corn shakes.''
|-
!Rhombulus and Omnitraxus
|Hmm?
|-
!
|''They quickly hide their cups in embarrassment.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Look, Eclipsa, we hate being here as much as you do.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Nuh-uh! I hate being here way more than she does!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, I highly doubt that.
|-
!Star
|[takes picture of herself and Eclipsa]
|-
!Omnitraxus
|Silence! We have extremely troubling news to report.
|-
!Star
|[giggling] Oh, Tom, you are such a cutie patootie.
|-
!Omnitraxus
|This is not a laughing matter.
|-
!Star
|Okay, in my defense, I wasn't actually listening.
|-
!Rhombulus
|You know, young lady, I have half a mind—
|-
!Star
|HALF a mind? [laughs] No. I think you have more like an eighth.
|-
!Eclipsa
|[giggles]
|-
!Omnitraxus
|[laughs] Eighth of a mind.
|-
!Hekapoo
|[laughs]
|-
!Rhombulus
|All right, hand over the phone.
|-
!Star
|[makes a Rainbow Fist] Why don't you come and get it, Trapezoidius?
|-
!Rhombulus
|Oh, no, you didn't!
|-
!
|''Rhombulus freezes Star's phone in crystal.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Oh, no, YOU didn't! Oh, you're going down!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to Janna and the crow in the sky.''
|-
!Janna
|If you think I'm letting go, you're sorely mistaken.
|-
!Crow
|[caws]
|-
!Janna
|[looks worried]
|-
!
|''The crow lets go of the boot, causing it and Janna to fall.''
|-
!Janna
|Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Stupid bird! [screams]
|-
!
|''Tom flies up and catches Janna in his arms.''
|-
!Janna
|Tom, what are you doing?
|-
!Tom
|Uh, saving you.
|-
!Janna
|No, you're keeping me from my boot! [points at [[Butterfly Castle]]] Look, I need my boot, and you need your compact. Let's go get our stuff.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to Bureaucracy of Magic's meeting room. Star is sitting in a chair with her arms crossed. In the seat next to her, Rhombulus is covered in bruises with his left snake arm in a cast.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|[crying] It hurts so bad...
|-
!Omnitraxus
|I will now yield the floor to Hekapoo, who has a matter of great importance to discuss.
|-
!Hekapoo
|Thank you, Omnitraxus. We have discovered that someone in Mewni has been using extremely powerful magic spells that haven't been used for centuries.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Is that so? Any idea who's been doing it?
|-
!Hekapoo
|No, but we've been tracking it in order to find out where it's concentrated.
|-
!
|''Hekapoo uses a remote control on Omnitraxus to show a map of Mewni. Several red circles appear around Monster Castle.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|You know, if the source is going to turn out to be Monster Castle, you really could save us a lot of time.
|-
!Eclipsa
|So you mean to tell me that you dragged us all the way here and bored us half to death just to ask me that?
|-
!Hekapoo
|Well, yeah. That's... right.
|-
!Rhombulus
|[simultaneously] Well, duh. I mean...
|-
!Omnitraxus
|[simultaneously] Pretty much.
|-
!Star
|Well, yeah. Between me, [[Glossaryck]], Eclipsa, and [[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]], there are some pretty serious magic users in the Monster Temple.
|-
!Hekapoo
|It's not Glossaryck, and no living queen has ever used magic like this.
|-
!Eclipsa
|[sarcastically] Well, hasn't this been fun? I can hardly imagine a better way to spend an afternoon. Thank you for your hospitality, and I'll be sure to keep an eye out for any unusual magicking. [walks away] Let's go, Star.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Butterfly Castle. Tom and Janna find the giant metal boot on a pile of other junk.''
|-
!Janna
|Ah. So this is where he's been taking all my stuff. Come on, let's get it.
|-
!Tom
|[holding Janna back] Hold on, let's... Let's think about this. This bird is NOT normal. He's super strong.
|-
!
|''The crow watches them from a crack in the wall.''
|-
!Janna
|No, he's just a dumb bird. This is what they do: take all the shiny stuff and dump it in their nest. Come on. [jumps over a wall] You want your compact, don't you?
|-
!Tom
|[hovers over the boot, gasps, dives into the boot] Here it is! [cleans phone screen] Hmm. I've missed you, baby. [continues texting]
|-
!
|''Janna pushes the boot off the pile of metal.''
|-
!Janna
|[climbs into the boot] All right, let's get out of here.
|-
!Tom
|I'm all for that.
|-
!
|''Tom shoots flames out of his feet to push them forward, but the boot suddenly stops moving.''
|-
!Tom and Janna
|[gasps]
|-
!Tom
|What's going on?
|-
!
|''The crow stops the boot from moving with just one wing.''
|-
!Tom
|[gasps] What do we do?
|-
!Janna
|Tom, you got to blast the bird.
|-
!Crow
|[flaps his wings, caws]
|-
!Tom
|I'm not gonna blast the bird!
|-
!
|''Flapping up into the air, the crow suddenly transforms, turning into a monstrous, over-muscular version of itself.''
|-
!Crow
|[shrieks]
|-
!Tom and Janna
|[scream]
|-
!
|''Tom and Janna jump out of the boot as the crow perches on it. Janna falls backward onto the floor, and the crow approaches her.''
|-
!Crow
|[shrieks]
|-
!
|''The crow swings its axe-like beak down at Janna, and she barely dodges its attacks.''
|-
!Janna
|Uh, it's-it's fine! You know what? You can have the boot!
|-
!
|''The crow swings its beak at Janna once more, and Tom defends her by sacrificing his phone. The phone screen cracks into a dozenpieces.''
|-
!Crow
|[growls]
|-
!Tom
|We got to get out of here! Run!
|-
!Crow
|[shrieks, flaps its wings]
|-
!Janna
|You got to blast him, Tom!
|-
!Tom
|Yeah, yeah, okay, fine!
|-
!
|''Tom blasts fire at the crow, hitting its right eye.''
|-
!Tom
|[laughs] Yes!
|-
!
|''The crow glares at Tom and Janna. Its right eye is now white with a red scar across it, and the feathers around it are burned off.''
|-
!Janna
|Uh... you probably shouldn't have done that.
|-
!Tom
|What are you talking about?! You've been telling me to blast him all day!
|-
!Janna
|Come on, we got to get out of here!
|-
!
|''Tom and Janna run away. The crow perches on top of the boot. Scene cuts to Star's bedroom; Star removes her boot and dumps Sean's donuts out of it. Tom and Janna enter.''
|-
!Tom
|[giggles] Knock, knock.
|-
!Janna
|Yo, what up?
|-
!Star
|Well, look who it is. A guy who had a fun day.
|-
!Tom
|Oh, yeah. We got up to some serious weirdness. I almost died!
|-
!Star
|Aw, I didn't know you were actually gonna go out and do stuff. That makes you so much more attractive to me.
|-
!Tom
|Oh, yeah. [flips up his jacket collar] I know how to make my own fun.
|-
!Janna
|Yikes, man. You really shouldn't do that.
|-
!Tom
|Hey, are those donuts?
|-
!Star
|Wait, Tom! No-no-no-no!
|-
!Tom
|''(o.s.'') [with mouth full] Oh, yeah! Tasty! Gluten-free?
|-
!
|''Cut back to Butterfly Castle; the monster crow carries the metal boot into another part of the castle. It transforms back to a normal crow and perches on [[Mina Loveberry]]'s arm.''
|-
![[Mina Loveberry]]
|Oh, Sebastian, my poor little baby. Did they hurt your eye?
|-
!Sebastian
|[nods]
|-
!Mina
|Well, don't worry. It was all worth it.
|-
!
|''Mina is shown assembling a giant suit of armor.''
