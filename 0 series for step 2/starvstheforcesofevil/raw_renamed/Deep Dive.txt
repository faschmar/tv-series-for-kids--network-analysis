| ''Scene opens outside [[Butterfly Castle]]. It is night. Inside, [[Star Butterfly]] is pacing while talking to [[Marco Diaz]] and [[Janna Ordonia]].''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
| Okay, I thought it was a dream, but then, it was like, "Oh, no, you ate all these Goblin Dogs," so it's like, it was not a dream. And then I brought the Goblin Dog truck into my bedroom, and then I crushed my bed with it, and I had to turn my bed back into a bed, [breathes]...
|-
!
| ''Janna blows air onto Marco's face; Marco resists laughing out loud.''
|-
!Star
| ...and then I told my mom about it, and my mom was, like, "Oh, that shouldn't be happening." And I was like, "Oh, no..." [noticing Janna] Janna. Stop blowing in Marco's hair.
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
| What?! That was you?!
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
| Sorry. Got a little bored. No offense.
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, Star, can you just get to the point, please?
|-
!Star
| [sighs] Okay, I'm sleep-portaling. In my sleep, every night, I hear this sound, and it's like... [high-pitched whining]. Oh, no, that's not it. [high-pitched whining]
|-
!
| ''Marco and Janna both cover their ears, but even still, Star's noises are agitating them.''
|-
!Janna
| Okay, Star, we get it! Can we just get to the point, please?
|-
!Star
| I've been following this sound [unrolls map] to the same location every night. But I never make it there because I wake up. And that's where you come in, Janna. You've gotta hypnotize me so I can stay asleep.
|-
!Marco
| What? Hypnotize you? Star, shouldn't you leave that to a trained professional?
|-
!Janna
| You doubt my skills?
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, actually I do.
|-
!Janna
| [snaps fingers] Chicken butt.
|-
!
| ''Marco falls off the couch, asleep. Janna snaps, and Marco's awake again.''
|-
!Marco
| What the heck? What happened?
|-
!Star
| You guys, stop messing around and get over here. [straps mirror to headband] Hey, check it out. I linked my compact phone to my [[Interdimensional mirror|mirror]], so you'll be able to see whatever I see. Marco, you've got the [[Dimensional scissors|scissors]]. If anything goes wrong out there, you come get me. You're my lifeline.
|-
!Marco
| What if you get lost, or go so far out that we can't find you?
|-
!Star
| Marco, we've dealt with much worse stuff than this.
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, I guess.
|-
!
| ''Star gets into her bed and puts her [[Star Butterfly's wand|wand]] on her bedside table.''
|-
!Janna
| Okay, Star. Take a nice, deep breath.
|-
!Star
| [breathes]
|-
!Janna
| Now, focus on my watch.
|-
!Marco
| Hey, that's ''my'' watch.
|-
!Janna
| Dude, this is about Star. Get over yourself.
|-
!Marco
| Ugh.
|-
!Janna
| Keep your eyes on the watch. You're feeling light as a feather.
|-
!
| ''Star's eyes close, and she drifts to sleep.''
|-
!Marco
| And now we wait.
|-
!
| ''They leave her briefly.''
|-
!Janna
| So what exactly does it look like when she portals?
|-
!
| ''Behind them, Star begins opening a portal.''
|-
!Marco
| Kinda like that.
|-
!
| ''Star and part of her bed are sucked into the portal, which then closes.''
|-
!Janna
| We have liftoff.
|-
!
| ''The two walk over to Star's mirror to watch her journey. The mirror flashes on, and the scene transitions to Star's perspective. She flies through dimension after dimension, only spending a few seconds in each one before flying through a different portal into another.''
|-
!Marco
| [from Star's room] I'm here for you. Your lifeline.
|-
!
| ''Janna walks away from the mirror and moves a table over to it. Janna's various belongings are on it.''
|-
!Marco
| Uh, what's all that?
|-
!Janna
| Spiritual chromatograph, magic wave scope, energy oscillotron, and a jigsaw puzzle for when things get slow. But most importantly, [knocks everything off the table] the map.
|-
!Marco
| Agh... agh... where is she?! Oh, here she is, she's here! No, no, maybe she's here! Or here. No. Forget this. I'm goin' in!
|-
!Janna
| Dude, relax. She's got a long way to go. [grabs popcorn]
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, I guess you're right.
|-
!Janna
| [eating popcorn]
|-
!Marco
| So... Janna. Been a while since we've hung out one-on-one. [laughs] We've never really had–
|-
!Janna
| [snaps] Chicken butt.
|-
!
| ''Marco falls off his chair, asleep, and Janna watches Star. Somewhere in a space-like dimension, Star hears the whining sound she described earlier. She looks around and there's a huge purple/pink vortex right next to her. Back in Star's room, Janna's reading a book entitled "Hypnotism" when she notices the vortex.''
|-
!Janna
| What the... [snaps] Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
|-
!Marco
| Huh... what... Huh? Janna? What did you–
|-
!Janna
| Shh, shut up and look.
|-
!Marco
| Wait. Where is that on the map?
|-
!Janna
| I don't know. She's off the map.
|-
!
| ''Star gazes at the vortex, mesmerized by it.''
|-
!Marco
| Star. No, no, no, no, no. Don't, don't go in there.
|-
!
| ''Star approaches the portal, closes her eyes, and flies into it. Her compact phone falls off her head. In her room, the mirror flashes with multicolored light, and then goes static.''
|-
!Marco
| No! That's it. I'm goin' in.
|-
!
| ''Marco opens a portal and jumps in, but the portal spits him back out into Star's room.''
|-
!Janna
| What happened? Where is she?
|-
!Marco
| I can't get to her with the scissors if I don't know where she is.
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps to Star, who's submerged in gold liquid. She floats to its surface, and her eyes open. A small unicorn is on her, and it licks her face.''
|-
!White Unicorn
| You're here.
|-
!Star
| [wipes her face, dreamily] I'm here.
|-
!
| ''The unicorn continues to lick her face.''
|-
!Star
| [laughs] Stop, stop it, stop it.
|-
!Other Unicorns
| [soft whinnying] You're here!
|-
!
| ''All the small unicorns start licking her face.''
|-
!Star
| Okay, okay, okay. I'm here. But where is here?
|-
!Blue Unicorn
| You don't know? You're in the Realm of Magic.
|-
!Star
| [gazes at surroundings] Wow! It's like Toffee was never even here.
|-
!White Unicorn
| It's been rebornded.
|-
!Star
| That's not a word.
|-
!
| ''A siren-like sound echoes in the distance.''
|-
!Star
| That sound.
|-
!White Unicorn
| The song of the firstborn. She's been calling to you.
|-
!
| ''The sound continues as a larger white unicorn comes running up to Star.''
|-
!Star
| [closes muzzle] Okay, stop, please. And thank you. So who are you?
|-
!Unicorn
| Do you not recognize your own creation?
|-
!
| ''Star's memory flashes back to [[Toffee (episode)|episode Toffee]], where she created a unicorn.''
|-
!Star
| [loud gasp] I made you?! [examines her] I did good. So you're the one that called me here?
|-
!Unicorn
| I can only call one who wishes to be called.
|-
!Star
| I don't understand. Why would I wish to be called?
|-
!Unicorn
| I don't know. Perhaps the answer rests here in the Realm of Magic.
|-
!Star
| Oh, I can't stay. I have to go home.
|-
!Unicorn
| Do you?
|-
!
| ''All the other unicorns whinny while riding a wave of gold liquid.''
|-
!Star
| [mesmerized] I guess I could stay.
|-
!
| ''The unicorn puts Star on her back.''
|-
!Unicorn
| Plug your nose.
|-
!Star
| Oh, okay. [holds breath]
|-
!
| ''The unicorn and Star trot beneath the surface of the water. Scene changes back to Star's room.''
|-
!Mirror
| [flashing "Error"] Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
|-
!Marco
| [frustrated groan]
|-
!Mirror
| Please check the number and try again.
|-
!Marco
| Come on, come on. Call Star.
|-
!Mirror
| Calling Star. [flashes "Error"]
|-
!Marco
| [shaking the mirror's blinds] Aaaaahhh! Ugh, what am I gonna do?
|-
!Janna
| Oh, what about Glossaryck? [picks him up] Maybe he can...
|-
![[Glossaryck]]
| [screaming] [[Globgor]]! [falls on his face]
|-
!Janna
| You're a disgrace to magic.
|-
!Marco
| Magic. [walks to Star's wand]
|-
!Janna
| Oh, that's a bad idea. And that's coming from me.
|-
!
| ''Marco picks up the wand and closes his eyes.''
|-
!Janna
| Ooh-aaaaah, [ducks] you're gonna die! [grabs Glossaryck]
|-
!Glossaryck
| Ooh!
|-
!
| ''Nothing happens. Marco opens his eyes.''
|-
!Marco
| Huh. Nothing happened. It's like our souls are bonded–
|-
!
| ''Marco screams as the wand pulls him up into the air and flashes with energy. It then transforms into a new wand with a teal compass-like dial and bat wings. Janna takes a marker and adds a black dot to it.''
|-
!Janna
| And there. Now it has your mole.
|-
!
| ''Marco opens up Star's bedside table and takes out her spell notebook. He flips to "The All-Seeing Eye" and hands Janna the notebook.''
|-
!Janna
| Whoa. The All-Seeing Eye? "Spying leads to crying"?
|-
!Marco
| Just hold it up so I can read it.
|-
!Janna
| Okay.
|-
!Marco
| [takes a deep breath] Okay. I summon the All-Seeing Eye to tear a hole into the sky. Reveal to me that which is hidden. Unveil to me what is forbidden!
|-
!
| ''The wand surges with magical energy. Marco's cheeks glow with crescent moons. The All-Seeing Eye activates. Scene jumps back to Star. She and the unicorn are hanging out on top of some gold liquid fountains.''
|-
!Star
| Ssssssss-salmon. Sss-stromboni? Strawberry? Sally... Sally!
|-
!Unicorn
| What are you doing?
|-
!Star
| I can't remember my name.
|-
!Unicorn
| What's a name?
|-
!
| ''Marco's image appears in the All-Seeing Eye.''
|-
!Marco
| Star!
|-
!Star
| That's it! That's my name. Star. Thanks, strange boy.
|-
!Marco
| Star, you have to come home.
|-
!Star
| I am home.
|-
!Marco
| [to Janna] We've gotta get her out of there. [to Star] Just give me your hand.
|-
!
| ''He tries to stick his hand through the spell, but it clouds up with red, and the spell collapses.''
|-
!Star
| Marco... Marco? [sitting up] Marco!
|-
!
| ''She takes off running and accidentally transforms into her butterfly form.''
|-
!Star
| Ahhhh!
|-
!
| ''She gestures with her hands, causing a portal to open up.''
|-
!Unicorn
| Wait. Where are you going? Don't go.
|-
!Star
| I'm sorry. I have to.
|-
!
| ''She flies into the portal. Scene changes to Butterfly Castle. Star pops out of a portal in her room.''
|-
!Star
| Janna? Janna? Marco? Where are you?
|-
!
| ''She looks around the room. The room's been damaged, and half of her stuff is aflame.''
|-
!Star
| Janna! Marco!
|-
!Marco
| [groaning from under a table] Over here.
|-
!Star
| [gasps, lifts the table with magic] Oh, my gosh, Are you okay?
|-
!Marco
| [holds up wand] Better now without that table on me.
|-
!Star
| My wand. [grabs it]
|-
!
| ''The wand transforms back to normal.''
|-
!Star
| What did you do?
|-
!Marco
| Well, I was kind of out of options.
|-
!Star
| Oh, Marco, that was incredibly stupid of you.
|-
!Marco
| That's a little mean.
|-
!Star
| [hugs him] Thank you.
|-
!Marco
| [blushes]
|-
!Janna
| Ew, gross. Get a portal.
|-
!Star
| Janna!
|-
!
| ''Janna is dangling from a broken support beam.''
|-
!Janna
| No rush.
|-
!
| ''The beam collapses and Janna falls.''
|-
!Star
| [catches her] Gotcha.
|-
!Janna
| This is the coolest thing that has ever happened to you.
|-
!Star
| Agreed. Oh-ho-ho, check this out. [transforms back to normal] Huh? [transforms to butterfly form] Huh? [back to normal] Huh? [back to butterfly] Huh? [back to normal] I can do it... at will!
|-
!Janna
| So are you still hearing that sound?
|-
!Star
| I... I guess I'm not.
|-
!Marco
| And does that mean you're going to quit sleep-portaling?
|-
!Star
| I guess... it does.
|-
!Marco
| I don't know. I'm not convinced that this is–
|-
!Janna and Star
| [snap] Chicken butt.
|-
!
| ''Marco collapses.''
