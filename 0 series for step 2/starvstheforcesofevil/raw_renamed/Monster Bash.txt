| ''Scene opens outside the Monster Temple, which is decorated festively with lights. [[Star Butterfly]] is inside, hanging them up as quickly as possible. She then sticks a party hat on a skull, dumps some candy in a bowl, places a ladle in a punch bowl, and jumps into her boots, zipping them up.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
| All right, [[Marco Diaz|Marco]]. What do you think? Is it too much?
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
| It's not too much.
|-
!Star
| Is it not enough?
|-
!Marco
| I think it's perfect.
|-
!Star
| But does it read as [[Mewmans]] ''and'' Monsters together?
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, basically.
|-
![[Rich Pigeon]]
| Stop worrying, Star [bends over to sip some punch from Star's goblet]
|-
!Star
| Oh, Rich, it is really cool of you to pay for this party. I cannot believe you found this place.
|-
!Rich
| No [sips] problem [sips], Star. [sips]
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, thanks. And I'm glad your leg is better.
|-
!Rich
| Legs heal, Marco, but grudges last forever. [menacing silence]
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, well... I'm sorryâ€”
|-
!Rich
| Kidding, kidding! [laughs] Water under the bridge. Besides, I love throwing parties. What's the point of money if you aren't lording it over everyone, hmm?
|-
![[Pony Head]]
| Hiiiii! Time to get this thing started now. Okay, I'm sorry that I'm late, but guess why. It's 'cause I brought you a gift.
|-
!
| ''Johnny Blowhole carries over a photo booth and then collapses. [[Kelly]] steps out of it.''
|-
![[Kelly]]
| Hey.
|-
!Star
| Ohhhhh! Pony, you're the best.
|-
!Pony Head
| [to Marco] Oh, did you hear that? The best. Me. [to Star] Ooh, but, girl, this looks more like a standoff than a party. There's tension.
|-
!
| ''All the monsters are on one side of the room, and all the other are on the other side. None are speaking to each other.''
|-
!Star
| Ugh. Maybe I pushed too hard and they aren't ready for this.
|-
!Rock Johansen
| [sips a glass, throws it down] That's it!
|-
!
| ''The music stops.''
|-
!Star
| Oh, no. No!
|-
!Pony Head
| Ooh! Okay, now it's getting started.
|-
!Rock
| If no one else is gonna say anything, I will! [walks over to the monsters] How dare you?!
|-
!
| ''All of them run away except for a fuzzy yak monster.''
|-
!Yak Monster
| Uh, uh me?
|-
!Rock
| [examining him] Pre-distressed ripped-knee jeans. I should've thought to wear mine. What's it like being the coolest dude here?
|-
!Yak Monster
| Oh, you're... you're happy at me?
|-
!Rock
| Yes, I'm happy at you.
|-
!Yak Monster
| Oh, well, thanks. Where'd you get those horns? I really like 'em.
|-
!Rock
| Oh, ha-ha. These old things? Yeah, boating accident. I should've died.
|-
!Yak Monster
| Yeah, you should've.
|-
!Rock and Yak
| [laughing]
|-
!Rock
| Yeah, it was pretty painful.
|-
!
| ''The two crowds now start mingling, and the music starts up again.''
|-
!Star
| Oh, thank corn.
|-
!Marco
| See? You had nothing to worry about.
|-
!Star
| Monsters and Mewmans partying together. Who'd have thunk?
|-
!
| ''Scene changes. [[Miss Heinous]]' car is parked somewhere outside the party. Inside, her tracking device beeps.''
|-
![[Gemini]]
| Here he comes.
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps to Marco, who waves his arms above his head. The Goblin Dogs van rushes in, almost running him over.''
|-
!Marco
| Aah! Geez! Careful, [[Roy]].
|-
!
| ''Scene jumps back to the car. Miss Heinous's checks start glowing.''
|-
!Gemini
| Milady, your cheek marks are glowing.
|-
![[Miss Heinous]]
| Put in the mixtape.
|-
!Gemini
| As you wish.
|-
!
| ''Gemini puts in a cassette entitled "I Hate Princess Marco Turdina Mix". Thrash rock begins playing, and Heinous headbangs to it. Meanwhile, back at the party, Star is introducing Larry Kelpbottom to a bird-like monster.''
|-
!Star
| Introductions!
|-
!Bird Monster
| Hey, so, like, wanna dance?
|-
!Larry
| Mmm, sure.
|-
!
| ''Star and Marco poke their head around the party, making sure everything is in good shape.''
|-
!Star
| [to DJ robot] Beats, on point. [at punch bowl] Punch. [licks a drop] Not cold enough!
|-
!Marco
| On it! [runs off]
|-
!Star
| Marco! I have magic. [pulls out wand, casts spell]
|-
!
| ''The bowl becomes encapsulated in a giant ice cube.''
|-
!Star
| Hmm. [licks it, tongue get stuck] Hmm!? Cold, cold cold, uh-huh. [whines]
|-
!
| ''[[Tom Lucitor]] holds up his hand and melts the ice with some fire, freeing Star's tongue.''
|-
!Star
| Oh! Oh, my dear sweet angel lady, I thought I lost you. [sighs, looks up] Tom, when did you get here?
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
| Um, I helped you set up. Remember? Rich Pigeon made me carry in that statue of him. [gestures]
|-
!Star
| How did I not notice that till now?
|-
!Tom
| I don't know. I looked great moving it... all by myself. [helps Star up] It's your loss really. May I have this dance?
|-
!Star
| Aww, you're being very sweet, but I have to focus on this party right now. It's a new age, Tom. Monsters and Mewmans living in harmony, and I want everyone to remember this night forever.
|-
!Tom
| Well, do you remember this? [moves in to kiss her]
|-
!Star
| What are you doing?
|-
!Tom
| Uh, being romantic and kissing you.
|-
!Star
| [laughs] Oh. [suggestively] You might have to help me remember then.
|-
!Tom
| Okay.
|-
!
| ''He moves in to kiss Star again, but right as he's about to do so, Star inhales deeply and blows right into Tom's mouth. Tom turns away and coughs the air out.''
|-
!Tom
| Star!
|-
!
| ''Star then immediately hugs him and kisses him on the cheek multiple times.''
|-
!Tom
| I miss this. I miss you. I haven't seen you at all recently. Come on, just one little dance.
|-
!Star
| Oh, Tom, I miss you, too. But I really gotta focus. We'll dance later.
|-
!
| ''Star blows him a kiss and runs off.''
|-
!Tom
| I'll see you then.
|-
!Marco
| [returns with bag of ice] Ice! Oh, Star fixed it.
|-
!Tom
| Dude, I-I don't get it. She'll be queen soon anyway. Why not enjoy being young just for a little longer?
|-
!
| ''He groans and hits the table, setting the punch on fire. Marco opens the block of ice and tries to dump it in.''
|-
!Marco
| She's been working on this for months, man. This is important to her. She's trying to fix centuries of bigotry and social biases that plague [[Mewni]]...
|-
!
| ''Tom punches the ice block, which is stuck in the bag. The ice block breaks into cubes that put out the fire in the punch.''
|-
!Tom
| Sorry, sorry. Just gonna stop you there, Marco. I'm not into politics. [walks away]
|-
!Marco
| Dude, you're a prince. Everything you do is political.
|-
!
| ''An arm off-screen creepily reaches for Marco. Marco jumps back into a karate pose.''
|-
!Marco
| Whoa!
|-
!Rich
| [gasps] Look, guys, I got him to do it! I got him to do the sword hand dance! Everyone, sword hand dance!
|-
!
| ''Upbeat music begins playing and everyone starts doing the "sword hand dance".''
|-
!Marco
| No, it's... it's not a dance. This indicates I'm poised for combat.
|-
!Kelly
| Hey, Marco, wanna dance?
|-
!Marco
| Okay.
|-
!
| ''On the outside of the party, [[Princess Spiderbite]] is rubbing her spider bite. [[Slime Monster]] walks up to her.''
|-
![[Slime Monster]]
| Ahem. Would you like to...?
|-
!
| ''A piece of slime drips off and splatters to the floor.''
|-
!Spiderbite
| Eww, no. Does that actually work on girls? Come on!
|-
!Slime
| Well, yeah, it works on everybody. Girls' bites, boys' bites. It even works on grandmas' bites.
|-
!Spiderbite
| Wait, what?
|-
!Slime
| My slime. It's just like aloe vera.
|-
!Spiderbite
| You actually wanna cure my spider bite?
|-
!Slime
| Yeah. Uh, well, only if-if you want to.
|-
!Spiderbite
| Dude, I am so sick of this spider bite! Give me some of that!
|-
!
| ''The two high-five, and Spiderbite applies the slime to her bite. The bite vanishes instantly.''
|-
!Spiderbite
| Whoa! That's amazing! ''You're'' amazing.
|-
!Slime
| Oh, it's nothing. [leans against wall] Really.
|-
!
| ''The wall behind him collapse, and he falls backwards down some dark stairs. Spiderbite looks in, slipping on his slime and falling down right on top of him.''
|-
!Spiderbite
| Oh, my gosh! Slime, are you okay?
|-
!Slime
| [lifting his head] I'm okay. You'd be surprised how many times that's happened.
|-
!
| ''Something growls.''
|-
!Slime
| [looks at surrounding monster statues] There's some pretty spooky statues down here.
|-
!Spiderbite
| Yeah. That one looks like it's seen better days.
|-
!Slime
| That one looks like my old math teacher.
|-
!
| ''A large shadow approaches Spiderbite and Slime.''
|-
!Spiderbite
| [laughs] Yeah, and that one looks like... it's breathing?
|-
!
| ''Both scream as the shadow draws closer. Scene goes black, and then returns to the party upstairs.''
|-
!Pony Head
| This party is on point. Good job, girl!
|-
!Star
| Aww, thanks, Pony. You know, I think I really did do a good job.
|-
!Rich
| [raising goblet] To Star Butterfly, for putting on this magnificent party.
|-
!Squirrel Monster
| And inviting everybody to come.
|-
!Star
| Aww, you guys. Stop.
|-
!Crowd
| Speech, speech!
|-
!Star
| Okay, I'm blushing. I'm literally blushing, guys. [sighs] Well, we kids are the future, and starting tonight, we are going to create a new Mewni. A Mewni where everyone is welcome anywhere. [squeals] I'm so excited, I could scream.
|-
!Spiderbite
| [screams] Help!
|-
!Star
| Oh, my gosh. [runs over to her] What happened?
|-
!Spiderbite
| Ahh... It-it was a monster.
|-
!Bird Monster
| What is going on over here?
|-
!Larry
| Obviously, she was attacked by that slimy monster.
|-
!Bird Monster
| What? Slime wouldn't attack anybody.
|-
!Duck-Billed Monster
| Is he still down in that chamber?
|-
!Spiderbite
| I... I...
|-
!Duck-Billed Monster
| We saw you take him down there.
|-
!Bird Monster
| Yeah, like, what did you do to him?
|-
!Star
| Okay, has anyone seen Slime Monster?
|-
!Mole Monster
| No, but Eric's missing, too. He was over by that door earlier.
|-
!Squirrel Monster
| So was Tanya. [to Rock] Weren't you dancing with Tanya earlier?
|-
!Rock
| There were a lot of girls. I don't know all their names.
|-
!Squirrel Monster
| What did you do with Tanya?
|-
!Rock
| Nothing! Monsters do whatever they want!
|-
!Squirrel Monster
| What is that supposed to mean?
|-
!Rock
| It means Mewmans aren't the ones attacking people and dragging them through creepy hidden doorways. You know, monsters. It's like their instinct.
|-
!Squirrel Monster
| Oh, here it comes. Just 'cause he's a monster.
|-
!Pony Head
| [to Star] Hey, girl.
|-
!Star
| Oh, Pony, thank goodness.
|-
!Pony Head
| I don't know what you did, but this party just got way more interesting.
|-
!Squirrel Monster
| You're jumping to conclusions.
|-
!Rock
| Just common knowledge.
|-
!Star
| [screaming] Stop!
|-
!
| ''Everyone falls silent.''
|-
!Star
| Please, everybody, just let me take care of this. Go back and enjoy the party. There's fresh punch; it's very cold. The Goblin Dog food truck is out front, and we even have some... jokes! [to Pony Head] Pony, keep everybody entertained while I investigate.
|-
!Pony Head
| Ooh! I'm the jokes!
|-
!
| ''Outside the party, Marco is looking through the Goblin Dogs menu.''
|-
!Marco
| [reading] "Original, Strawberry." Roy, who... who gets strawberry?
|-
!Roy
| [shrugs]
|-
!Marco
| Can... Can I have one?
|-
!Star
| Marco, I need you. [grabs him away]
|-
!Marco
| Whoa!
|-
!
| ''Scene changes back to the party.''
|-
!Tom
| [to Rich] Your hat looks fine.
|-
!Marco
| [being dragged] Star, I was doing something.
|-
!Star
| Tom, I need your help. Monster kids have started disappearing, and nobody knows where Slime Monster isâ€”
|-
!Tom
| Star, relax. It's a party. They're probably just off cuddling somewhere... which is what you and I should be doing. Don't you think?
|-
!Marco
| Ewww.
|-
!Star
| Ugggh! I do not have time for this, Tom. Don't you understand? If something bad happens to those monsters, everything I've worked for will be ruined. So you can either help me or you can get out of my way. Come on, Marco. [walks away]
|-
!Marco
| Princesses. [pats Tom's back] Pat, pat. [walks away]
|-
!
| ''Tom bursts into flames, then cools it. A piece of the ceiling falls to the floor next to him. Scene jumps to Star and Marco who are now descending down the stairs with a candelabra.''
|-
!Star
| Hey, Slime? Slimy dude. You in here?
|-
!
| ''The two find a streak of slime leading into darkness. They follow it down even more stairs.''
|-
!Marco
| What do you think this place was anyway?
|-
!Star
| I don't know, but these stairs are not easy in this dress.
|-
!
| ''The two enter a chamber with a large circular door.''
|-
!Marco
| Whoa, check it out. It's like a little campsite.
|-
!
| ''Marco walks up to a pile of books next to a pitched tent. He opens one.''
|-
!Marco
| These earmarks are fresh.
|-
!
| ''One of the torches on the wall goes out. Star and Marco jump in fright.''
|-
!Star
| Slime? If that was you, now would be a nice time to tell us.
|-
!
| ''The candelabra goes out.''
|-
!Marco
| [panicking] Matches, matches, matches!
|-
!Star
| Okay, [panics] I found a candle!
|-
!Marco
| Here, here!
|-
!Star
| I can't see where! Oh, wait, I'll just use my wand.
|-
!
| ''Star's wand flickers with light. Someone else puts down their foot causing Star and Marco to jump.''
|-
!Star and Marco
| [yelp]
|-
!Star
| What the... [[Mina Loveberry]]?
|-
![[Mina Loveberry]]
| Mud Sister?
|-
!
| ''Scene cuts to black. Cut back to Mina Loveberry in the temple sub-basement.''
|-
!Mina
| Hah. What the heck are you doing here?
|-
!Star
| I am throwing a very important Mewman and Monster friendship party.
|-
!Mina
| Wait, wait, wait, monsters? I've been throwing monsters into this closet all night.
|-
!
| ''She opens up the closet; trapped inside are six different monsters.''
|-
!Slime
| Get us outta here!
|-
!Star
| What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no! What are you doing? You need to let them go right now!
|-
!Mina
| Ha! I need to keep this place safe from evil monster treachery.
|-
!Star
| They're not evil, they're my friends. Come on. This place is abandoned. Nothing sinister is going on.
|-
!Mina
| Young warrior, everything about these monsters and whosits is sinister.
|-
!Star
| You don't understand. I am trying toâ€”
|-
!Mina
| Interrupting! ''You'' don't understand the complexities of this situation. I am duty-bound to protect this temple. Doctor's orders.
|-
!
| ''Mina holds up a rock with two eyes and smile drawn on. It is wearing a stethoscope.''
|-
!Marco
| This one's all you, Mud Sister.
|-
!Star
| Maybe it's time to get a second opinion.
|-
!Mina
| You doubt the words of a professional?
|-
!
| ''Mina starts poking Star with the probe of the stethoscope.''
|-
!Star
| No, but, just... Ow! Okay, stop it! Okay, Mina, look, let's just calm down and not escalate things.
|-
!Mina
| I'm not the one escalating things, escalator! I've been waiting hundreds of yearsâ€” Aaah!
|-
!
| ''The ceiling above her caves in; on top of the rubble is Miss Heinous.''
|-
!Miss Heinous
| Princess Marco.
|-
!Marco
| Heinous?! Oh, no! I am done running from you. This ends now!
|-
!
| ''Gemini and [[Rasticore]] pounce on Marco and Star. Moments later, Star tries to gnaw away Rasticore's arm while Gemini straps Marco to Miss Heinous's machine.''
|-
!Miss Heinous
| Okay. Now to set the mood. Play the music.
|-
!Gemini
| Uh, again, milady?
|-
!Miss Heinous
| [growling] Play it!!
|-
!Gemini
| Yes, ma'am. [under his breath] Heard it 15 times.
|-
!
| ''The thrash begins to play. Miss Heinous headbangs to the music.''
|-
!Miss Heinous
| [putting the bulb on her head] Start the machine.
|-
!
| ''Gemini tries to start it.''
|-
!Gemini
| Okay... um... Milady... the lever is... stuck.
|-
!Miss Heinous
| What? Hmm?
|-
!Gemini
| Whenâ€“when I push it, it doesn't go down.
|-
!Miss Heinous
| [pushes Gemini aside] You imbecile! Utterly incompetent! But no matter. This is between me and Princess Marco now.
|-
!
| ''Miss Heinous's cheeks glow, and the ground shakes. Behind them, the circular door glows with two clubs inside a spade. It opens slowly. The entire temple explodes with a blast of light. Miss Heinous walks towards the room.''
|-
!Gemini
| Milady?
|-
!Miss Heinous
| [gasps, enters the room] It can't be.
|-
!
| ''The room appears to be a nursery.''
|-
!Marco
| So are we still fighting or...?
|-
!Star
| Read the room, Marco.
|-
!
| ''Miss Heinous picks up two dolls, one a red monster, and the other who looks like [[Eclipsa Butterfly]].''
|-
!Gemini
| What have you got there [chuckles], milady?
|-
!Miss Heinous
| Dolls.
|-
!Gemini
| Oh, I... I can see that.
|-
!Miss Heinous
| These were ''my'' dolls. [clasps them to chest] I love my dolls.
|-
!Gemini
| That's... That's very... nice.
|-
!Miss Heinous
| I can't believe it. It's all coming back to me. That was my bookshelf. And my toy chest. This place â€“ this was my nursery. [gasps]
|-
!
| ''Miss Heinous walks over to the crib and wipes the dust away on its backboard, revealing the name "Meteora".''
|-
!Miss Heinous
| And this... this was my baby bed.
|-
!Gemini
| But... how is this possible?
|-
!Mina
| Oh, it's possible, all right! I knew you'd be back here one day... Meteora!
|-
!Gemini
| I beg your pardon! This is Miss Heinous, the honorable headmistress of [[St. Olga's Reform School for Wayward Princesses|St. Olga's School for Wayward Princesses]]!
|-
!Miss Heinous
| No. Meteora. That ''is'' my name. At least, it was my name a long, long time ago. [her cheek marks glow again]
|-
!Gemini
| Milady, your arm.
|-
!
| ''Miss Heinous's arm now has the appearance of a red claw with scales.''
|-
!Miss Heinous
| No, no, no, no, no!
|-
!Gemini
| Shall I fetch your makeup?
|-
!Mina
| Well, ain't this a pretty picture? First, Eclipsa wakes up, and now, look who comes a-cryin'. Ty-pi-cal.
|-
!Star
| Whoa, wait. Eclipsa? What does she have to do with this?
|-
!Marco
| Yeah, uh, can someone fill us in?
|-
!Mina
| Don't you ding-dongs know anything? She's her mama! [gestures to a portrait of Eclipsa holding Miss Heinous as a baby]
|-
!Marco
| Eclipsa is Heinous' mother?! But how?! Eclipsa is hundreds of years old! Besides, that would mean Heinous is a... a princess!
|-
!Star
| It... means she's a Butterfly.
|-
!Mina
| It means [jumping into air] she's a [demonic voice] monster!
|-
!
| ''Mina, in a fit of rage herself, turns into her muscular augmented form. She hovers in mid-air.''
|-
!Gemini
| Now, uh, uh, see here...
|-
!
| ''Mina blasts Gemini aside with a blast from her arm. She then holds up her arm to Miss Heinous.''
|-
!Star
| Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mina. Just... Wait just one second. I got a lot of questions here.
|-
!Mina
| Doctor's orders!
|-
!Star
| [grabs wand] Double Rainbow Fist!
|-
!
| ''Star shoots a pair of Rainbow Fists at Mina to throw her against a wall.''
|-
!Star
| [to Marco] Quick, go get the monster kids!
|-
!Marco
| Right!
|-
!
| ''Mina gets up and takes another swoop at Star. Star shoots out a few blasts, but Mina swats them away easily.''
|-
!Star
| Stardust Daisy Devastation!
|-
!
| ''Mina is surrounded by a barrier of stardust and daisies, but she breaks it. Marco successfully frees the monsters and looks in on Star still blasting away. Mina dives at Star, but Marco jumps in and knocks her out of Mina's path.''
|-
!Yak Monster
| [running] Whoa! Get out!
|-
!Mina
| Ugh, you let them go?! You traitor!
|-
!
| ''Mina glows blue with flames and starts blasting the fire at Star. Star takes cover behind a pillar. Miss Heinous is still staring at her dolls.''
|-
!Gemini
| Miss Heinous! We must leave quickly!
|-
!
| ''Marco grabs some of Mina's books and throws them at her. They merely agitate her.''
|-
!Mina
| Ugh!
|-
!
| ''Meanwhile, Tom comes heading down the stairs using his finger as a candle.''
|-
!Tom
| Star? Star, are you down here?
|-
!
| ''Star screams as she's thrown against the wall right in front of Tom.''
|-
!Star
| Tom!
|-
!Tom
| Star! Look, I know I did something wrong, and I'm still not sure what, but I want to apologize.
|-
!Star
| Oh, that's great, great. Kind of got a thing here.
|-
!
| ''Star runs back into the room. Tom sees the fight and ignites his fists.''
|-
!Star
| Spider With a Top Hat Blast!
|-
!
| ''[[Spider With a Top Hat (character)|Spider With a Top Hat]] appears, and his top hat turns into a minigun. He blasts Mina with laser fire.''
|-
!Spider
| War cryyyyyyy!
|-
!
| ''The bullets do nothing, and Mina smacks him over to Star. Mina then walks towards Star slowly. Star tries a few blasts. Tom joins in and growling with rage, he casts a spell which causes a fault line to emerge beneath Mina. From the chasm, large stone blocks emerge, encasing Mina in a coffin-like space which Tom wraps with golden magic chains. Mina manages to break free, knocking Tom aside.''
|-
!Tom
| Oof! Agghhh!
|-
!
| ''Mina looks around the nursery, now completely ablaze in blue fire.''
|-
!Mina
| Where is she?! Where is Meteora?! Nooo!
|-
!
| ''Mina screams, punches a hole in the ceiling, and flies away. Scene jumps back to the party.''
|-
!Pony Head
| [laughing] Okay, all right. Here's a good one. Okay. Mmm. Knock, knock.
|-
!All
| Who's there?
|-
!Mina
| [crashes through the floor] Where is Meteora?! Where's the monster?!
|-
!Star
| Raspberry Ribbon Lasso!
|-
!
| ''The spell grabs a hold of Mina's ankle.''
|-
!Star
| You're ruining everything I'm trying to accomplish!
|-
!Mina
| Well, you just helped the most dangerous monster in the history of Mewni escape!
|-
!
| ''The doors to the temple burst open, and blasts fly everywhere, crystallizing party goers indiscriminately.''
|-
!Rock
| What's happening?!
|-
!
| ''The Butterfly Castle royal guards rush in.''
|-
![[Rhombulus]]
| Everybody, freeze!
|-
!Star
| Uh-oh.
|-
!Mina
| The donut patrol? Huh. I gotta make track.
|-
!
| ''Mina runs over to a window and jumps out. She flies away by spinning her hair like helicopter blades.''
|-
!Star
| So... you guys came here to party?
|-
!
| ''Scene changes to outside the temple. A knight straps yellow "Though Shalt Not Cross" tape against the entrance. Sirens wail.''
|-
!Rhombulus
| You are in a world of trouble, young lady.
|-
!Star
| Look, it was just a party, okay? We weren't doing anything wrong.
|-
!Rhombulus
| Oh, really? Then what was that huge surge of magic we detected in the dungeon earlier?
|-
!Star
| Oh, yeah. That. [laughs]
|-
!Rhombulus
| Do you have any idea what this place is?
|-
!Star
| Uh... a fun place to throw parties?
|-
!Rhombulus
| It's not just a fun place to throw parties. It's... Well, I'm not even authorized to tell you what it is. That's how bad it is.
|-
!
| ''His left snake arm blows raspberry.''
|-
!Star
| You don't know what it is, do you?
|-
!Rhombulus
| What? No! I totally know what it is! It's...
|-
!
| ''His left arm immediately starts jabbering to Rhombulus.''
|-
!Rhombulus
| Oh, yeah. Ugh. I don't have time for this. You stay here. I got a crime scene to deal with.
|-
!
| ''He walks over to Miss Heinous's car and crystallizes it.''
|-
!Tom
| [to Star, holding a goblet] Hey. I made this for you. I mean, no, that's-that's a lie. They're just handing them out over there. I was, um... here.

| ''Tom lights the drink on fire to warm it up and hands it to Star.''
|-
!Star
| Aw, thanks, Tom.
|-
!Tom
| So, sorry for being a total nag back there. I get it now. You were dealing with some serious stuff.
|-
!Star
| It's okay. Doesn't even matter now anyway. The party was a disaster.
|-
!Tom
| What? No! It was a great party. I mean, yeah, sure, some monsters got trapped in a closet. And Mina probably traumatized some people. And we got busted by the cops. And I... am not helping at all right now.
|-
!Star
| This is all my fault. I really thought I could just change everything overnight. Ugh, I was so wrong.
|-
!Tom
| Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. There's no way you could've known that all this weirdness would happen.
|-
!Star
| Yeah, that's the problem, Tom. I don't know anything. I don't know how to fix what's wrong with Mewni. I don't even know who my own family is anymore. All that stuff with Heinous and Eclipsa. I just... what?

| ''Star sees some guards escorting the monster party goers.''
|-
!Star
| Hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? Let those monsters go.
|-
!Guard 1
| We found these hooligans loitering outside the temple. I need to take them in for processing.
|-
!Star
| Oh, really? Then why don't you process those hooligans?
|-
!
| ''Star gestures to the royal kids, who are wrapped in blankets and being given hot chocolate .''
|-
!Guard 2
| More hot chocolate, Your Highness?
|-
!Spiderbite
| Yes.
|-
!Guard 1
| Well, uh...
|-
!Star
| Let 'em go!
|-
!Guard 1
| Yes, Your Highness.
|-
!Star
| [to monsters] I am so sorry this happened to you guys.
|-
!Elephant Monster
| Ugh, it's okay, Star. Trust me, this happens to us all the time.
|-
!Star
| I-I can make it up to you. Stay for the after-party. Snacks on me.
|-
!Elephant Monster
| Uh, thanks, but I've had enough parties for a while.
|-
!Slime
| Yeah, I almost died for real.
|-
!Elephant Monster
| Catch you later, okay?
|-

| ''They all walk off together. Scene jumps to a road in the forest. The guards in their horse-drawn vehicles are heading back, sirens wailing. After they pass, Gemini leans out from behind a tree.''
|-
!Gemini
| Ooh, there's too much heat out there. We should get going, Miss Heinous.
|-
!Miss Heinous
| [cheek marks glowing] That's not my name.
|-
!Gemini
| I'm... sorry?
|-
!
| ''Miss Heinous stands up, and Rasticore looks shocked. When she turns around, she has yellow eyes, pointy ears, and fangs.''
|-
!Miss Heinous
| My name is Meteora.
