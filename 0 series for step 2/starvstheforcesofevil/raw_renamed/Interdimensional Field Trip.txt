|-
!
|'''(The Episode starts with [[Star Butterfly|Star]] screaming happily trough the window of a running Schoolbus, really excited for something)'''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|''(Who is sitting next to her)'' Seriously Star? There is nothing to be excited about, it's just...
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|''(Interrupting Marco)'' The best day of my life! We're Going on a Field Trip!
|-
![[Miss Skullnick]]
|Cork it "Princess"!
|-
!Star
|I can't believe we're actually doing this! ''(Star takes Marco's phone and looks at something)''
|-
!Star
|Oh, he's so cute! I just want to gobble him up!
|-
!
|''(The thing on Marco's phone reveals to be a "[[Wikipedia:Lolcat|Funny Cat Image]]")''
|-

|I hope [[Jackie Lynn Thomas|Jackie]] likes it as much as you!
|-
!Star
|Oooh, conversation starter!
|-
!Marco
|Shhh!, She is right there! ''(Points at Jackie, who is looking at her phone)''
|-
!Star
|Yeah she is right there! You go talk to her.
|-
!Marco
|More than just "Hello"? Too risky. I may say something dumb. That's why I let the kitten pics do the talking for me. ''(Sends the pic to Jackie)''
|-
![[Jackie Lynn Thomas]]
|''(After receiving the pic)'' Oh, I love it!
|-
!Marco
|''(Showing the conversation to Star)'' She sent me an "L.O.L". ''(Gasps)'' We're communicating!

|Why must you torture us!
|-
!
|''(Star starts worrying about the success of the trip)''
|-
!Skullnick
|Well, you know what? ''(Taking the megaphone again)'' Life is boring!
|-
!Star
|Miss Skullnick! Life is supposed to be fun!
|-
!Skullnick
|I used to think that, but now I'm fifty and all my dreams are in the rear view mirror. The best thing of my life is teaching you kids, and I hate teaching you.
|-
!Star
|That's cause you're doing it all wrong.
|-
!Skullnick
|And you think you can lead this trip better than me?
|-
!Star
|I was born to lead, literally
|-
!Skullnick
|''(Laughs)'' Ok, go ahead then! When you fail, those brats might actually appreciate me for a change.
|-
!Star
|''(Talking to the students)'' Who wants to go somewhere not boring?!
|-

|-
!Marco
|What is this place?
|-
!Star
|Oh, just a planet full of the most odd and unbelievable things in the universe.
|-
!Miss Skullnick
|''(Yelling of the megaphone)'' No running! No yelling! No...!
|-
!Star
|Hey hey hey hey ''(Blasts the megaphone off with a magic spell, and turns it into a "Megaphone animal" that runs away)'' You put me on charge, so Rule NÂ°1: No rules!
|-
!Skullnick
|No rules leads to Anarchy.
|-
!Star
|When you give people the freedom to do whatever they want. ''(Gives Marco back his phone)''
|-
!Marco
|I get more bars here than i do on earth! ''(Walks away)''

|-
!Skullnick
|I'm gonna live to be Four Hundred? And here I thought I was going trough "The big change." Turns out i'm a teenager again!
|-
!
|''(Back to the students, they are running free trough the dimension, except for Marco who is still on the "Funny Cat Images" enterprise, but Jackie doesn't pay attention to him because she is riding a flying stingray)''
