|''Episode begins in the [[Forest of Certain Death]]. A mail carrier and his [[Warnicorns|warnicorn]] travel quickly through the forest.''
|-
!Mail carrier
|[panting] Okay, Trot-Fudge Sundae! You got this! [wails]
|-
!
|''The mail carrier's cart jumps over a snapping Venus flytrap-like monster. The cart slows down near [[Ludo]]'s parents' house.''
|-
!Mail carrier and warnicorn
|[panting]
|-
!Mail carrier
|[leaves mail on house's front porch] Here you go. [leaves]
|-
!
|''Ludo's father Brudo pushes a plank of wood aside and looks through the mail slot. He opens the door to pick up the mail.''
|-
!Lord Brudo
|[grumbles, grunts, closes door] [tossing envelopes] Junk... Junk... Junk... [holding a box] Mm, what's in here?
|-
!
|''The box reads "LUDO" on the bottom.''
|-
!Brudo
|Ugh! The worst junk. [tosses box in trash can] When will they stop sending us that garbage?
|-
!
|''[[Dennis]] is seen hanging out at the bottom of the stairs. He brings the box to his room and closes the door. He dumps the box's contents onto the floor.''
|-
![[Dennis]]
|Ludo shirt, Ludo mask, Ludo mask, Ludo mask, Ludo mask. [groans]
|-
!
|''A shiny object glimmers under the pile of Ludo merchandise.''
|-
!Dennis
|[gasps] [[Dimensional scissors]]?
|-
!
|''Dennis closes the curtains and takes out a book called "Black Metallurgy and Ores of the Multiverse". He heats up a beaker of liquid and drops the scissors in it.''
|-
!Dennis
|All right, Ludo. Where are you?
|-
!
|''The liqud in the beaker turns blue.''
|-
!Dennis
|Oh! Blue! Let's see. What's blue? [flips through book pages] Oh, please don't be the Cat-Face Dimension.
|-
!
|''The liquid turns green.''
|-
!Dennis
|Wait, green? Okay, green.
|-
!
|''The liquid turns pink.''
|-
!Dennis
|No, pink. Okay, that's—
|-
!
|''The liqud turns blue again.''
|-
!Dennis
|Blue again? What's going on?
|-
!
|''The liquid then turns a rainbow of colors and swirls around in the beaker.''
|-
!Dennis
|Uh-oh. Oh, no-no-no-no-no!
|-
!
|''The beaker explodes, and purple smoke bursts out the window.''
|-
!Dennis
|[coughing]
|-
!Brudo
|(''o.s.'') Dennis!
|-
!
|''Brudo enters the room.''
|-
!Brudo
|What's going on up here?
|-
!Dennis
|[wheezes] Nothing.
|-
!Brudo
|Well, that nothing interrupted me and my stickers! [sniffs sticker] Mmm. Good old scratch-n'-sniff. What's this? [steps on Ludo bobblehead, groaning] Honey! He's doing it again! Dennis, do you know what a deadbeat is? It's you! That's what you're gonna be if you keep acting like your brother – collecting all this garbage, destroying property, acting like you're too good for us!
|-
!Lady Avarius
|[appears in doorway] Oh! Are we berating Dennis? It's not even dinnertime!
|-
!Brudo
|He's hoarding Ludo stuff again.
|-
!Avarius
|Dennis, how could you? Ludo betrayed us. He and his goons took over the castle. He was the worst!
|-
!Dennis
|[under his breath] ''You're'' the worst.
|-
!Brudo
|[menacingly] You got something to say?
|-
!Dennis
|No.
|-
!Brudo
|"No" what?
|-
!Dennis
|No... sir.
|-
!Brudo
|That's what I thought. Now clean up this mess and come help me and your mother with our stickers.
|-
!Avarius
|And mind your nails. We need those fresh young fingers.
|-
!
|''Brudo and Avarius leave the room and close the door. With a sad expression, Dennis starts cleaning up the mess. [[Bald eagle|Bird]] and [[Giant spider|Spider]] emerge from his closet.''
|-
!Dennis
|[sighs] No, you guys. You need to get back in the closet. My dad catches you out here, he's gonna freak.
|-
!
|''Spider picks up Ludo's dimensional scissors and drops them in front of Dennis.''
|-
!Dennis
|Spider, these things are useless unless I know where he is.
|-
!Spider
|[clicks mandibles]
|-
!Dennis
|What? Y-You just want me to... [snips scissors]
|-
!Spider
|[nods head]
|-
!Dennis
|[sighs] Okay. [opens portal] Be my guest.
|-
!
|''Spider jumps into the portal. Dennis looks over at Bird, who just stares back at him.''
|-
!Bird
|[squawks softly]
|-
!
|''Spider emerges back through the portal.''
|-
!Spider
|[clicks mandibles]
|-
!Dennis
|I-I told you, they don't work if you don't know where he is.
|-
!Spider
|[clicks mandibles]
|-
!Dennis
|[sighs] Okay.
|-
!
|''Over the course of some time, Dennis opens portal after portal for Spider to go into.''
|-
!Dennis
|[groans] Come on! [smacks himself] Stay awake!
|-
!
|''Spider returns through a black and green portal.''
|-
!Dennis
|What is it?
|-
!Spider
|[clicking mandibles]
|-
!Dennis
|[gasps] You found him!
|-
!
|''Dennis pulls Ludo's old skull helmet out from under his bed and puts it on his head.''
|-
!Dennis
|Let's get my brother.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to a house on an asteroid somewhere in the dimensional void. Dennis and Spider emerge from a portal and stumble onto the front lawn.''
|-
!Dennis
|[yelps] Our... house? Made of garbage.
|-
!
|''Dennis enters the front gate. Ludo, wearing a robe and with his beard hair tied behind his head, is seen watering the plants and whistling a tune.''
|-
!Dennis
|Ludo?
|-
![[Ludo]]
|[turns around] Wha-a-a-t?! Spider!
|-
!
|''Dennis has his arms stretched out to hug Ludo, but Ludo runs right past him and hugs Spider.''
|-
!Ludo
|[laughs] It's you! Oh, my friend!
|-
!Dennis
|Brother, it's me, Dennis.
|-
!Ludo
|Dennis? How long has it been? Last time I saw you, you were this tall. And now you're exactly
as tall as I am! What are you doing here?
|-
!Dennis
|I came to bring you home.
|-
!Ludo
|Dennis, this is my home. Come inside.
|-
!Dennis
|[goes inside]
|-
!Ludo
|[to Spider] I just cleaned up. I can't have you come into the house. You'll make a mess. Look, Papa hasn't forgotten about you. [shakes bugs out of his beard and into a bowl] Ooh, been saving up a stash for my best girl!
|-
!Spider
|[eats bugs]
|-
!Ludo
|[laughs] Bon appétit! [to Dennis] Come sit.
|-
!
|''Ludo leads Dennis over to a chair and takes the skull helmet away.''
|-
!Ludo
|Let me take care of this for you. [throws skull helmet in the trash]
|-
!Dennis
|[stammers] But that's your helmet from when you ruled the Monster Army.
|-
!Ludo
|And now it's ruling the garbage.
|-
!Dennis
|That was a piece of your legacy.
|-
!Ludo
|[pushes Dennis's chair into another room] I'm done with that part of my life. Now how about a drink, you? Nothing too fizzy, of course. Make yourself comfortable. Could you ask Mother and Father if they'd like a beverage?
|-
!Dennis
|Uh... Mother and Father?
|-
!
|''Sack dummies shaped like Brudo and Avarius are seen on the couch next to Dennis.''
|-
!Ludo
|Dennis, do you want crushed ice or regular? [humming happily]
|-
!
|''Ludo returns with a tray of cups and gives one to Dennis.''
|-
!Ludo
|Oh, thank you, Mother. I do make the best sodas, don't I?
|-
!
|''Dennis dumps screws and brown sludge out of his cup.''
|-
!Dennis
|Thanks, yeah. Look, Ludo? You gotta come home. Mom and Dad are driving me nuts.
|-
!Ludo
|[looking crazy] But you can't say that in front of them, Dennis.
|-
!Dennis
|Okay, fine, Ludo. Let's just go talk in the kitchen, then. [leads Ludo away from parent dummies] Look, I really, really need you to come home.
|-
!Ludo
|I am home.
|-
!Dennis
|No, Ludo. I'm at my wits' end. The yelling, the berating, the stupid scratch-n'-sniff stickers. All they do is push me around and talk trash about you!
|-
!Ludo
|What are you talking about, Dennis? Mother and Father love us!
|-
!
|''A mug falls off of the dummy shaped like Brudo.''
|-
!Ludo
|They're so happy you're here! cha-rahds after dinner! [whispering] They always let me win! [giggles]
|-
!Dennis
|What are you talking about—?
|-
!Ludo
|Just kidding! I'm just really good at cha-rahds. Now stop worrying. That's not the Dennis I barely remember. Make that frowny turn upside-downy!
|-
!Dennis
|Okay. But after dinner—
|-
!Ludo
|And cha-rahds.
|-
!Dennis
|And after... cha-rahds... we're leaving, okay?
|-
!Ludo
|Yes, Dennis, whatever you say.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to several hours later. Ludo tucks the dummies into bed.''
|-
!Ludo
|There we go, all tucked in! What's that? Oh, yes. How could I forget? [pats dummy] Good night, my darling.
|-
!
|''Ludo leaves the room and joins Dennis in the hallway.''
|-
!Ludo
|[whispering] They're finally asleep. What angels!
|-
!Dennis
|Awesome. Cool. Now let's go.
|-
!Ludo
|Go? Dennis, I can't just go.
|-
!Dennis
|Ludo—
|-
!Ludo
|Shhh!
|-
!Dennis
|[yelling] We don't need to whisper! There's no one who can hear us! Now come on! [walks away] This is ridiculous. I'm gonna lose my mind. Oof!
|-
!
|''Dennis bumps into the Brudo and Avarius dummies.''
|-
!Dennis
|What the?
|-
!Ludo
|Mother! [laughs] Father! What are you doing up?
|-
!Dennis
|What are you doing?
|-
!Ludo
|Cha-rahds? At this hour? Mmm... Well, you twisted my arm! I'll do it! [giggles]
|-
!Dennis
|This whole thing is a cha-rahd! [grunts] Charade!
|-
!Ludo
|Just one more round, Dennis! Let's humor them. Come on, what do you say?
|-
!
|''Dennis picks up the dummies and sets them down on the other side of the room.''
|-
!Dennis
|Okay, let's get out of—
|-
!
|''The dummies appear in front of Dennis again.''
|-
!Dennis
|Where did—?
|-
!Ludo
|I don't know.
|-
!Dennis
|[groans, pushes dummies to the side] You know what? Never mind. The sooner we leave, the better.
|-
!
|''The dummies appear beside Ludo again.''
|-
!Ludo
|But mother and father want us to stay.
|-
!Dennis
|[groans] No, forget it!
|-
!
|''Dennis grabs Ludo by the hand and leads him out of the room. Ludo ends up in front of Dennis with the dummies yet again.''
|-
!Ludo
|Wow, they really wanna play cha-rahds. Once they get going... [laughs]
|-
!Dennis
|Stop! This isn't funny! These aren't our parents. This is actual garbage.
|-
!
|''Dennis takes a wire hanger off of the Lady Avarius dummy, which crumbles in his hand.''
|-
!Ludo
|Oh, no! Mother! We can fix this. We can fix this. We can fix this. It's fine, we can fix this. We can fix this. We can fix this.
|-
!Dennis
|You're losing it.
|-
!Ludo (imitating Brudo)
|Calling his own mother and father garbage?! How about I teach you to apologize?!
|-
!Ludo (imitating Avarius)
|Watch his fingers, dear.
|-
!Dennis
|[under his breath] ...You watch ''your'' fingers.
|-
!Ludo (imitating Brudo)
|What did you say?!
|-
!Dennis
|I said you watch your fingers, ''sir!''
|-
!
|''Dennis tackles the Brudo dummy to the floor and beats it up, but the other dummies dogpile on him.''
|-
!Ludo
|Dennis!
|-
!Dennis
|[growls, bursts out of the dogpile]
|-
!Ludo (imitating Brudo)
|This is what we get!
|-
!Ludo (imitating Avarius)
|For raising brats like your and your brother!
|-
!
|''Dennis tackles more dummies to the floor. A giant Brudo dummy towers over Dennis.''
|-
!Ludo (imitating Brudo)
|Oh, but you're a big man now who thinks he and his brother are too good for this family!
|-
!Dennis
|Yes, I do!
|-
!
|''Dennis punches the dummy over and over before obliterating it with a single punch. Another Avarius dummy appears made out of a basketball hoop.''
|-
!Dennis
|[panting]
|-
!Ludo (imitating Avarius)
|Look at you! You're just like your awful brother!
|-
!Dennis
|Good. Because he's... my... hero!
|-
!
|''Dennis picks up a basketball with Brudo's face, dribbles it toward the hoop, and does a slam dunk, shattering the backboard.''
|-
!Ludo
|[teary-eyed] Dennis! [hugs Dennis's leg] You stood up for me! No one has ever stood up for me.
|-
!Dennis
|Of course. [hugs Ludo] I love you, big brother.
|-
!Ludo
|Oh, I lo... lub... oh, how to... l-o-o... ove? Lo-o-ve... yo... u-u? Tu... I love you, too!
|-
!Dennis
|Let's get out of here. We can face the real mom and dad now.
|-
!Ludo
|I can't. Something very important happened today, but I have lots more I need to work through before I can leave.
|-
!Dennis
|Well, I'm here to help. You're not alone anymore, big brother.
|-
!Ludo
|I know that now. But I have to do this part on my own.
|-
!Dennis
|But... you're my hero. No one else in the family was brave enough to leave. I can't stand up to them on my own.
|-
!Ludo
|Dennis, you just did! Did you see that dunk? You can jump higher than they could ever reach. You need to go find your own adventures.
|-
!
|''Dennis and Ludo share another hug.''
|-
!Ludo
|You're going to be just fine, kiddo. Take good care of Spider. She's quiet, but she's a smart lady.
|-
!Dennis
|And I'll take care of Bird, too.
|-
!Ludo
|I don't know who that is. Goodbye.
|-
!
|''Dennis and Spider leave through the dimensional portal. Ludo opens a closet, revealing dummies shaped like [[Star Butterfly]] and [[Marco Diaz]].''
|-
!Ludo
|Hello, Star and Marco. How about a game of cha-rahds?
|-
!
