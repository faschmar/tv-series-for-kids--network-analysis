|''Episode begins with [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] knocking on the door of a monster's house. The monster opens the door, and Marco hands him an envelope with [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]'s royal seal on it. [[Janna Ordonia|Janna]] is standing next to Marco.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|Greetings, friends! We would like to cordially invite you...
|-
!
|''Scene shifts to the Spiderbite Kingdom; Marco and Janna give an invitation to King Spiderbite, Queen Spiderbite, [[Princess Spiderbite]], and [[Slime Monster]].''
|-
!Marco
|...to the coronation of Queen Eclipsa!
|-
!
|''Scene shifts again to the Pigeon Kingdom; Marco gives an invitation to King Pigeon, Queen Pigeon, and [[Rich Pigeon]].''
|-
!Marco
|It's gonna be held at the Monster Auditorium...
|-
!
|''Scene shifts again to Monster Mim's house.''
|-
!Marco
|[shouting] ...and there's gonna be food and music!
|-
!Monster Mim
|You don't have to yell.
|-
!
|''Scene shifts again to [[Buff Frog]]'s house; Marco gives an invitation to Buff Frog and his [[Buff Frog's tadpoles|tadpoles]].''
|-
!Marco
|And a bounce house for the kids!
|-
!
|''Scene shifts again to the Assassins' Guild; Marco gives an invitation to [[Rasticore]], Babs, and a third unnamed assassin.''
|-
!Marco
|So, can we expect to see you there?
|-
!Assassin
|Heh-heh! Oh, we're DYING to go! [stabs doll of Eclipsa with a dagger]
|-
![[Rasticore]]
|Yeah, we'd KILL for a front row seat.
|-
!Babs
|[holding a book of death puns] Uh, did you guys say "of CORPSE" yet?
|-
!Marco
|...Awesome! Love that enthusiasm!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to [[Globgor]]'s chamber at the Monster Temple. A bear monster puts a bowtie on Globgor's frozen body.''
|-
!Marco
|Ugh! We still have so many invitations to hand out! How are we gonna deliver them all?
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
|[sighs, takes invitations from Marco] Come on, here. Let me show you how it's done. [walks up to [[Mewmans|Mewman]] on his compact phone] Hello, sir. Hand these out to 300 of your friends before midnight, or you'll die.
|-
!Man 1
|[screams, runs off with invitations]
|-
!Marco
|She's joking!
|-
!
|''Cut to [[Star Butterfly|Star]] and [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]] approaching the Yurt Village.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|I dunno. Maybe it's crazy to think my mom would go.
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|I think she'd be crazy not to go to the "cornonation".
|-
!Star
|[laughs] Wait, what did you call it?
|-
!Tom
|Corn-o-nation? That's what it says on the invitation.
|-
!Star
|What?!
|-
!
|''Star looks at the invitation. "Coronation" is misspelled with an extra "n".''
|-
!Star
|No, no! No-no-no-no-no! It's supposed to say "coronation". [groans] Marco! You were supposed to spell-check the invitation.
|-
!Tom
|Well, if you think about it, [[Mewni]] is sort of the only dimension where that kinda makes sense. We're pretty obsessed with corn.
|-
!
|''Star and Tom walk past several people as they enter the village.''
|-
!Star
|Whoa, where did all these people come from?
|-
!Tom
|I think they all live here?
|-
!Villagers
|[laughing]
|-
!Woman 1
|I hear she's still doing dark magic.
|-
!Man 2
|I am not surprised.
|-
!Man 3
|Well, I heard she keeps Globgor in a crystal and talks to him every night!
|-
!Man 2
|What a monster fangirl!
|-
!Woman 1
|I wouldn't go to that cornonation if you paid me!
|-
!Tom
|See? "Cornonation". Totally works.
|-
!Star
|Wait a minute. Is that [[Manfred]]?!
|-
!
|''Manfred is seen, un-petrified and eating an apple.''
|-
!Star
|Manfred!
|-
![[Manfred]]
|Star Butterfly?!
|-
!Star
|It is you! How'd you get all un-yada-yada'd?
|-
!Manfred
|Ugh! I don't want to get into that. I'm just glad that Queen Moon has created this beautiful oasis for all those who oppose Eclipsa's reign.
|-
!Star
|Wait, my mom did what?
|-
![[Moon Butterfly]]
|Manfred! There's no need for such divisive language here!
|-
!Star
|Mama!
|-
!Manfred
|Oh, please, Moon. All those who oppose Eclipsa, say aye!
|-
!Villagers
|Aye!
|-
!Moon
|All right, that's enough out of you. [pushes Manfred away] Go make yourself useful. [to villagers] That goes for you as well!
|-
!Villagers
|[Okay.] / [Yes, my queen.] / [Fine, Queen Moon.]
|-
!Moon
|Star! Tom! So sorry about that!
|-
!Star
|Uh, yeah. Uh, does everyone in this town really hate Eclipsa?
|-
!Moon
|Of course not! Don't listen to Manfred. He loves his gossip.
|-
!Star
|Okay, cool, because I brought you this! It's an invitation to Eclipsa's official coronation. It would really, really mean a lot to me if you came. It would send the message that Eclipsa isn't a villain.
|-
!Moon
|Oh, sweetie, I—
|-
![[River Butterfly]]
|Absolutely not! I hate those stuffy royal ceremonies. They make you wear itchy clothes and eat weird tiny food off those little plates. Besides, I already made plans to go bogbeast hunting with Eddie. Oh! Thomas, my boy! You're a strapping young lad. What say you come with us?
|-
!Tom
|Oh, I'm not really the outdoorsy—
|-
!River
|[picks up Tom over his shoulder] Well, at least take a look at my bogging gear before you go.
|-
!Tom
|Okay, I guess!
|-
!Star
|Look, this will be the last thing I do for Eclipsa. Seriously, after this, I am out! I just want to be a teen again. I don't even know what teens do anymore. Like... Do they jet-ski? Scrapbook? What do they do?!
|-
!Moon
|Oh, Star. You've grown up so much.
|-
!Star
|[blushes] Awww, Mom.
|-
!Moon
|Your devotion to the kingdom is truly commendable.
|-
!Star
|So you'll come?
|-
!Moon
|I didn't say that. I still have my reservations about Eclipsa.
|-
!Star
|Okay. And you don't have to support Eclipsa. But could you support me?
|-
!River
|Avast! [lifts up rowboat] Bogbeast straight ahead!
|-
!Tom
|[inside rowboat] I'll get him!
|-
!
|''Tom shoots fireballs from his hands and sets several things on fire, and the nearby villagers run away screaming while River and Tom go running through.
|-
!River
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''River trips, causing himself and Tom to fall over face-first in the dirt.''
|-
!Tom
|[muffled] Whoo-hoo!
|-
!Star
|ell, that's my cue to get going. Lots more invites to hand out. [helps Tom up and leaves]
|-
!Moon
|Good— Good luck, sweetie!
|-
!Star
|Thanks, Mom!
|-
!Moon
|[looks at invitation] "Cornonation"? Somebody forgot to spell-check.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the Monster Auditorium on the day of the coronation. The seats are packed with Mewmans and monsters.''
|-
!Sir Cuddles
|Here are your seats, Lord and Lady Spiderbite.
|-
!
|''A large monster sits in front of a pair of Mewmans with binoculars, blocking their view. [[Hekapoo]], [[Rhombulus]], and [[Omnitraxus Prime]] sit in a private seating box, and Hekapoo eats popcorn. Archibald flies to the stage holding a clipboard.''
|-
!Archibald
|Oh, dear, oh, dear! [pushes curtain aside] Five minutes to curtain, everybody! Five minutes!
|-
!Marco
|I dunno, Tom. Are you sure I shouldn't wear my meat blanket?
|-
!Tom
|[fixing Marco's shoulder epaulette] Dude, trust me on this one.
|-
!Janna
|[following [[Ruberiot]]] I'm just saying, it would be way cooler if you knew some [[Love Sentence]] covers.
|-
![[Ruberiot]]
|Okay, seriously, who are you? Who is this person? Why is she here?
|-
!Star
|Hey, has anyone seen Eclipsa?
|-
!
|[[Pony Head]]'s [[Pony Head family|sisters]] are around Eclipsa doing her makeup. Eclipsa is obscured by a pink cloud of hairspray.''
|-
!Pony Sisters
|[giggling]
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Hey! Hey, no-no-no-no-no! Pony Heads! Get away from her!
|-
![[Pony Head]]
|Chill out, B-Fly! Your girl is in good hands! Like, figuratively or whatever.
|-
!Star
|I swear to corn, if you are dolling her up in another one of those rocker getups, so help me—!
|-
!Pony Head
|Wait, baby girl. It's the reveal. Mm.
|-
!
|''The Pony Heads disperse, and the pink cloud disappears to reveal Eclipsa wearing a red and yellow gown and gold crown and holding the [[Royal Magic Wand]].''
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|How do I look?
|-
!
|''Star runs up and hugs Eclipsa, who blushes.''
|-
!Star
|You look like a real-life queen!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Thank you, Star. You've been so helpful to me these past few months.
|-
!Star
|Oh, no, you would have figured it out. Maybe.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I'm so glad you could come. And [[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]] is, too. Meteora! Come say hello to Star!
|-
!
|''Meteora, wearing a white dress and yellow bow, crawls on the wall and ceiling and spins her head 180 degrees before falling toward the ground.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, no-no-no-no-no! [catches Meteora in her arms] Now, what did I tell you about climbing in your formal wear?
|-
!Star
|Aww, look at you, li'l dressed-up baby!
|-
![[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]]
|[touching Star's cheeks]
|-
!Star
|Aw, li'l baby, you all ready to be baby coronated?
|-
!Ruberiot
|Well, you can't be coronated without a coronation song! Should we practice one last time, my Queen?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, of course! This song must go off without a hitch.
|-
!Star
|Goodness gracious, why do all our ceremonies have to have songs?
|-
!Ruberiot
|Because that's the way that queens get coronated! They play the song, the people cheer, and voilà! A newly coronated queen.
|-
!Star
|[under her breath] Just sayin', could've been a dance or something.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa's bone guitar has a broken string.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, when did this happen? Seems we're having some technical difficulties. I believe I have a spare set of strings back at the temple. Won't take but a minute.
|-
!Ruberiot
|Wait!
|-
!Star
|No-no-no, w-w-wait!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa flies up to the Monster Temple with her wand parasol.''
|-
!Star
|[sighs] Classic Eclipsa.
|-
!Tom
|Star! You gotta see this!
|-
!
|''Star pushes the curtains slightly aside to see Moon in the front row of the audience.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Mom! She came! Hey, Mom! Mom! Mom! Over here! Mom!
|-
!Moon
|[waves to Star]
|-
!Star
|[loud whisper] Thank you!
|-
!
|''Moon pantomimes several actions indicating River's beard, "walking", and "bogbeast".''
|-
!Star
|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oooooh. She says Dad is bogbeast hunting. And...
|-
!
|''Moon pantomimes more actions indicating Tom's horns, Star's cheeks, and her heart.''
|-
!Star
|Ugh! Mom! [sighs] She says we look cute together.
|-
!Tom
|Awww!
|-
!Star
|Everything is finally coming together! [hugs Tom] Ahhh! I can't believe it!
|-
!Tom
|You're pretty excited, huh?
|-
!Star
|Yeah! I mean, I know things with Eclipsa haven't been perfect.
|-
!Tom
|Mm-hmm.
|-
!Star
|But after today, I feel like I can actually move on!
|-
!Tom
|Whoa. 'Cause I've actually been thinking ''we'' could move on to somewhere else. Maybe like a trip or something?
|-
!Star
|Aww, Tom, that is so sweet!
|-
!
|''Star and Tom move in for a kiss, but Ruberiot pops up between them.''
|-
!Ruberiot
|Star!
|-
!Star and Tom
|Aah!
|-
!Ruberiot
|Where is Queen Eclipsa?! [nervously bending up and down]
|-
!Star
|Slow your roll, Rubes. There's no need to panic.
|-
!Archibald
|[holding a pocketwatch] Two minutes to curtain! Time to start panicking!
|-
!Star
|Buuuut it wouldn't hurt to check on Eclipsa.
|-
!
|''Star goes to Eclipsa's music room in the Monster Temple.''
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa? It's almost time.
|-
!
|''The room is empty.''
|-
!Star
|Where is she? [walks through temple halls] Eclipsa! [enters Eclipsa's bedroom] Uh, Eclipsa? [goes to snack machine room] Oh, Eclipsa! Huh. Must have just missed her.
|-
!
|''Star pounds a vending machine next to her, and it drops a Snookers bar. Star unwraps the candy bar and takes a bite out of it.''
|-
!Star
|[crunch] Mmm, that's good. Mm-hmm.
|-
!
|''While continuing to look for Eclipsa, Star steps on something that makes a crunching sound. She looks down and sees crystal fragments on the floor.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Inside Globgor's chamber, Star sees Eclipsa's bone guitar, the rooster with a ribbon tied around its beak, the bowtie that was on Globgor's frozen body, and a shattered crystal prison with no one inside.''
|-
!Star
|Eclipsa, what have you done?
|-
!
|''Star bursts out of the temple and hears microphone feedback coming from the auditorium below.''
|-
!Star
|Huh?!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa is on the auditorium stage with a microphone.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Attention, everyone! I'm afraid we must send you all home immediately. Globgor has escaped.
|-
!Crowd
|[gasps]
|-
!Star
|What?
|-
!
|''Hekapoo nods to Rhombulus and Omnitraxus.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Please, stay calm! Once we've evacuated you, return to your homes, lock your doors, bar your windows—
|-
![[Hekapoo]]
|No! Everyone, stay where you are!
|-
!
|''Hekapoo, Rhombulus, and Omnitraxus appear on stage and form a circle around Eclipsa.''
|-
![[Rhombulus]]
|Don't listen to Eclipsa!
|-
![[Omnitraxus Prime]]
|That's just what Globgor wants you to do! He'll pick you off one by one!
|-
!Eclipsa
|What are you doing?! I'm trying to protect everyone!
|-
!Rhombulus
|You're not trying to protect anyone, you traitor! [puts Eclipsa in handcuffs]
|-
!Eclipsa
|[gasps]
|-
!Hekapoo
|The [[Magic High Commission|Magical High Commission]] is officially declaring a state of emergency! All residents of Mewni must remain in their seats until further notice!
|-
!
|''Hundreds of Hekapoo clones form a ring around the auditorium, and Omnitraxus encloses the auditorium in a barrier.''
|-
!Woman 2
|What's going on?
|-
!Hekapoo
|We wait here until the threat of Globgor is neutralized.
|-
!
|''Hekapoo opens a [[dimensional portal]] over Meteora and locks her inside a metal cage.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|That should keep her out of trouble.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh...
|-
!Rhombulus
|Come on, let's go.
|-
!
|''Marco watches from behind the curtains.''
|-
!Marco
|Things do not look good out there.
|-
!Ruberiot
|[nervous whine]
|-
!Marco
|We need some sort of... Huh?
|-
!
|''On a bulletin board next to Ruberiot is a talent show flyer depicting [[Foolduke]].''
|-
!Marco
|Aha! A distraction! [takes the flyer]
|-
!Ruberiot
|Hey!
|-
!Marco
|[appears on stage] Hey, everybody! What's more fun than a cornonation?
|-
!Man 4
|(''o.s.'') Sit down, kid!
|-
!Marco
|That's right! A talent show!
|-
!Ruberiot
|Uh, hold on, Marco. We are artists. We can't just put on a talent show with no preparation—
|-
![[Foolduke]]
|[appears with bag of stage supplies] I'm ready!
|-
!
|''Backstage, Rhombulus keeps watch over Eclipsa.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Rhombulus?
|-
!Rhombulus
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Star appears in the doorway, looking serious.''
|-
!Star
|I need a moment alone with the Queen.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Uh, I-I don't know. What if you help her escape or something?
|-
!Star
|Do I look like I'm going to help her?
|-
!Rhombulus
|Ohhh, okay. But I'm gonna be right over there watching.
|-
!
|''Rhombulus walks away from Eclipsa while Star approaches her.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Star, thank goodness! You have to believe me! I swear I didn't let—!
|-
!Star
|Stop. I don't know what to believe. All I know is that I need to find Globgor before he hurts somebody. Do you have any idea where he might have gone?
|-
!Eclipsa
|No. I'm not sure.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Ha-ha! You think that liar's gonna tell you? She doesn't care about Mewni. All she cares about is her freak monster family.
|-
!Star
|[sighs, walks away]
|-
!Eclipsa
|[gasps] The bog! He... He might be at the bog. It was a special place for us.
|-
!Star
|[says nothing and continues walking away]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the bog, where Eddie is braiding River's beard.''
|-
!Eddie
|You sure you shouldn't be with the family at the cornonation?
|-
!River
|And abandon you in your time of need? Eddie, you're stressed! You need me!
|-
!Eddie
|I ain't stressed.
|-
!River
|Of course you are! How could you not be? You live in the wild with danger lurking every night. You have a sneaking suspicion that no one takes you seriously, including your own wife. And then there's the case of your daughter. Whom you love, of course. [scratches his armpit] Why wouldn't you? Very much! Ah, but sometimes you wonder if you and Moon would have been better off if... [finds bug in his armpit hair] A bug. [flicks bug away] Well, the point is, you have a lot on your mind.
|-
!Eddie
|...Wow-wee. I ''am'' stressed. I wonder if it also has to do with that beast that's approaching.
|-
!River
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Globgor appears before River and Eddie, covered in mud.''
|-
![[Globgor]]
|[low growl]
|-
!River and Eddie
|Aaaaaah!
|-
!
|''Cut to black. '''END OF PART A.'''''
|-
!
|'''''START OF PART B.''' Scene begins on the same shot of River and Eddie screaming at Globgor. Star appears facing Globgor's back.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, that's not good. Globgor!
|-
!Globgor
|[growls]
|-
!River
|Raah! Ha!
|-
!
|''River and Eddie jump up and catch Globgor's right horn with a small net, swinging around and around.''
|-
!River
|Star, sweetie! Look at your old man! He's caught the bogbeast!
|-
!Star
|Dad, that's not the bogbeast! That's Globgor!
|-
!River
|What?! [lands on Globgor's nose] Oof! Ah. Well, when you're right, you're right.
|-
!Globgor
|[growls]
|-
!River
|Aaah!
|-
!
|''Globgor unleashes a supersonic roar that blows a path through multiple trees. He then runs away from Star through the path he just made, dragging River and Eddie with him.''
|-
!Star
|Dad!
|-
!
|''Star leaps high into the air, transforms into her Butterfly Form, and flies after Globgor. She grabs River and Eddie off of Globgor and drop them off in a tree.''
|-
!Eddie
|Oof!
|-
!River
|Good luck, sweetie! I'm proud of you!
|-
!Star
|Globgor! You need to come with me! Now!
|-
!Globgor
|No! You stay away from me!
|-
!Star
|You know I can't do that!
|-
!
|''Star fires Raspberry Ribbon Lasso at Globgor, but he shrinks to small size, dodges it, and falls into the treetops.''
|-
!Star
|Don't make this more difficult!
|-
!
|''Star keeps firing magic at Globgor, and he keeps dodging. He then grows to huge size behind Star...''
|-
!Star
|Oh, boy.
|-
!
|''...and grabs her in his hands.''
|-
!Globgor
|I said stay away from me! I'm just trying to protect my wife and child!
|-
!River
|I'm a father myself! ''Her'' father!
|-
!Globgor
|[lets go of Star] Oh! Oh! Oh, okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Look, I have to go far, far away from here. If the Mewmans find out I'm free, they're just gonna take it out on my family.
|-
!Star
|So you're not gonna hurt anyone?
|-
!Globgor
|What?! No! Of course not!
|-
!
|''Globgor shrinks to normal size and sits on a log.''
|-
!Star
|Look, Globgor. Eclipsa and Meteora are already in danger.
|-
!Globgor
|Well, what am I supposed to do?
|-
!Star
|[sighs] I think I know. But you gotta come with me. [extends three hands to Globgor]
|-
!Globgor
|Which, uh... Which hand do I take?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to the Monster Auditorium; Pony Head is on stage.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Annnnd here is this one. [does a pose turned away and looking over her right shoulder] Boom!
|-
!Man 4
|I thought this was supposed to be a talent show! [groans]
|-
!Pony Head
|Posing ''is'' a talent!
|-
!Foolduke
|Thank you, Pony Head! Next up, we've got Marco!
|-
!Marco
|I don't know about this. I mean, I'm... I-I-I'm totally unprepared. [takes out a microphone] There's no way I could perform in front of a crowd right this very second.
|-

|''While Marco is speaking, Tom slips sunglasses onto his face, and he takes out his phone to play Love Sentence's "[[Too Little Too Late]]".''

!Marco and Tom
|Star!
|-
!Star
|[turns back to normal] Citizens of Mewni! There is someone I'd like you to meet.

!Marco

|-
!Janna
|[takes picture of Globgor] Nice job, Eclipsa. I get it now.
|-
!Star
|Please, stay calm! I know he looks scary, but Globgor doesn't want to hurt you!
|-
!Man 4
|That's Globgor?
|-
!Monster 1
|Why is he in handcuffs?
|-
!Man 5
|I thought he'd be bigger.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Globgor would just as fast eat you than look at you! But don't worry! I'll crystallize him right here on this stage for you all to see!
|-
!Omnitraxus
|But that isn't enough! As soon as Globgor's crystallized, Eclipsa will just set him free again!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Omni is right! We will never be safe if Eclipsa is allowed to be queen!
|-
!
|''Hekapoo snaps her fingers, and the curtains behind her burn away to reveal Eclipsa.''

!Globgor
|[gasps] My darkest star!

!Eclipsa
|[gasps] You!

!
|''Eclipsa and Globgor tear up as they look across at each other.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Hi, dear. It looks like you've gotten yourself into a bit of trouble.
|-
!Globgor
|It seems I have. Why did you set me free? I told you, this isn't what I want!
|-
!Eclipsa
|I didn't do it, I swear! [groans]

!
|''Rhombulus starts crystallizing Eclipsa from the feet up.''

|No-no-no-no-no-no, please! You guys have to stop!
|-
!
|''Globgor falls over, causing debris to fall on the stage. A piece of debris hits Star and knocks her back toward the audience.''
|-
!Star
|Aah! Oof!
|-
!
|''Star gets up and tries to go back to the stage, but Moon holds her back.''
|-
!Moon
|Star, please! I don't want to see you get hurt!
|-
!Star
|Mom, I have to save—! Wait.
|-
!
|''Globgor sneaks onto Omnitraxus' shoulder while tiny-sized. He expands the size of his left arm and punches Omnitraxus across the face, causing him to fall over. Hekapoo appears through a portal and attacks Globgor from behind. When he dodges, Hekapoo makes more clones of herself, and they pile on top of him. Globgor grows in size and throws them off.''
|-
!Globgor
|Yaaaah!
|-
!
|''Omnitraxus' hand appears out of the floor and grabs Globgor's tail.''
|-
!Globgor
|Aah!
|-
!
|''Omnitraxus swings Globgor around and around by his tail and hurls him into the sky.''
|-
!Globgor
|Aaaaah!
|-
!
|''Omnitraxus appears in the sky over Globgor and punches him back to the ground. Meteora watches the battle from inside her cage.''
|-
!Globgor
|[growling, roars]
|-
!Meteora
|Ba-ba! [shakes the cage bars] Dip down!
|-
!
|''The cage glows, and Meteora blasts it apart. She starts crawling in Globgor's direction.''
|-
!Meteora
|[giggling]
|-
!Eclipsa
|[gasps] Meteora! No! Don't go to Daddy! Come to Mommy, baby!
|-
!Monster 2
|Aw, man! Don't go that way, baby! Go back!
|-
!Meteora
|[giggling] Huh?
|-
!
|''Meteora becomes surrounded by flames. Globgor struggles against Omnitraxus.''
|-
!Omnitraxus
|Just give yourself up, Globgor! You and Eclipsa have struck terror into the hearts of Mewmans for too long!
|-
!Monster 3
|Hey! There's a baby in the fire!
|-
!Globgor
|Baby?
|-
!
|''Meteora is surrounded by flames.''
|-
!Meteora
|[crying]
|-
!Globgor
|No! Meteora!
|-
!
|''Globgor kicks Omnitraxus away and blows the flames out with his breath. Meteora stops crying. Globgor shrinks to normal size and picks her up.''
|-
!Meteora
|Ba-ba?
|-
!Globgor
|[tearing up] Yeah, that's right. It's Ba-ba.
|-
!Meteora
|[cooing]
|-
!Crowd
|Awwwww!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Huh.
|-
!
|''Star and Eclipsa watch from the side, with Eclipsa also tearing up.''
|-
!Globgor
|Look, we don't need to fight. Put me back in the crystal and let my family go.
|-
!Meteora
|[coos]
|-
!Rhombulus
|All right, let's do this!
|-
!River
|(''o.s.'') Over my dead body!
|-
!
|''River appears in the crowd and climbs over audience members toward the stage.''
|-
!Crowd
|[Cut it out!] / [Watch it!]
|-
!River
|That man was willing to stay in a crystal to keep his family safe! He's a dad just like the rest of us!
|-
!Star
|Yes, exactly! Well, I mean, not everyone here's a dad, but...
|-
!River
|[inhales] Not yet.
|-
!Rhombulus
|I don't care if he's a dad! He's evil! He's a king of monsters! And Eclipsa set him free!
|-
!Star
|No, Rhombulus. I don't think she did.
|-
!Crowd
|[Huh?] / [What did she say?]
|-
!Star
|Think about it. Eclipsa's gonna let Globgor out of his crystal on her coronation day? That doesn't make any sense!
|-
!Rhombulus
|So what you're saying is... Globgor let himself out!
|-
!Star
|It was ''you!''
|-
!Crowd
|[muttering]
|-
!Man 6
|Man, what a juicy twist!
|-
!Star
|''You're'' the one who let him out! ''You're'' the crystal guy! You put him there in the first place! And you can't stand that she's out now and people are accepting her!
|-
!
|''Rhombulus starts sweating and breathing heavily.''
|-
!Star
|You got anything to say for yourself?
|-
!Rhombulus
|[straining] All right! I did it!
|-
!Crowd
|[gasps]
|-
!Rhombulus
|I let him out so you could see what a monster he really is!
|-
!Star
|Yeah, that's funny. 'Cause he didn't do anything but try and get away from ''you!''
|-
!Rhombulus
|Well... maybe this time, he didn't hurt anyone. But sooner or later, he'll show his true colors! And so will Eclipsa! She's evil! I've seen it with my own eye!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Are you kidding me?! We don't trust Eclipsa either, but if you think putting everyone here in danger was a good idea, ''you're'' the bad guy here! Guards! You know what to do.
|-
![[Lady Whosits]] and Kyle
|Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut! [grab Rhombulus' arms]
|-
!Rhombulus
|Huh? No, no, wait! I can explain!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Aw, pipe down, big guy!
|-
!Globgor
|It doesn't matter who let me out. I'm free, but I can't stay here. [frees Eclipsa's feet from crystal and breaks her handcuffs] These people are afraid of me.
|-
!Star
|But if they're afraid of you, why are they still here?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Perhaps... ''they'' should decide.
|-
!Crowd
|[confused murmuring] / [Wait, what do you mean, decide?]
|-
!Eclipsa
|You may not all love me, but you've accepted me as your queen. Will you accept my husband as well?
|-
!Monster 4
|Wait, you want ''us'' to choose?
|-
!Monster 5
|This is a monarchy, not a democracy!
|-
!Man 1
|Wait, what does Queen Moon think?
|-
!
|''Everyone in the audience around Moon looks at her.''
|-
!Moon
|[sighs] How many times must I tell you? I'm not your queen anymore! It doesn't matter what I think!
|-
!Star
|[smiles]
|-
!Man 4
|Hmm... I dunno. Didn't he used to, like, eat people?
|-
!Monster 1
|Wasn't he just trying to protect his family from angry Mewmans?
|-
!Man 5
|I don't know how to respond to this shift in the paradigm!
|-
![[Buff Frog]]
|[holding Marco and Tom] I think we should give him chance! Is true, Globgor is free now. For some, is Mewman's greatest fear. But now it has happened! And it not so bad! He seem like big proud papa. Like Buff Frog!
|-
!Tom
|Dude, we're fine. You can put us down now.
|-
!Katrina
|Can't we all put the past behind us and make a fresh start?
|-
!Crowd
|Awwwww!
|-
!Man 7
|Yeah! What that fish kid said!
|-
!Crowd
|[cheering]
|-
!Globgor
|Huh.
|-
!Hekapoo
|Well, I guess this is happening.
|-
!Rhombulus
|Uh, so does this mean I'm off the hook?
|-
!Hekapoo
|Ha! Yeah, you wish. Come on, hotshot. We got a prison cell with your name on it.
|-
!
|''Star hugs Eclipsa and Meteora. Globgor, Marco, and Tom join the group hug.''
|-
!Ruberiot
|So, Queen, I know a lot just happened, but it's still your coronation. Shall we make this thing official?
|-
!Meteora
|[babbles, giggles]
|-
!
|''Eclipsa takes her bone guitar and starts playing [[Some Kind of Magic]]. The royal guards kneel around her.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[singing]<br />♪ It's some kind of magic ♪<br />♪ When we make it through the night ♪<br />♪ It's some kind of magic ♪

!
|''Janna pushes Globgor to join Eclipsa.''
|-
!Eclipsa and Globgor

!
|''Ruberiot joins in on harpsichord, and he and Foolduke smile at each other.''
|-
!Eclipsa and Globgor
|♪ Where nothing's quite so clear ♪<br />♪ But I won't even falter (won't even falter) ♪<br />♪ When it's you I'm with, my dear ♪

!
|''Moon walks up to Star, and they, Tom, Marco, and River share a group hug.''
|-
!Eclipsa and Globgor
|♪ 'Cause all I wanna do ♪<br />♪ Is stay in Mewni with you ♪
|-
!
|''The royal guards start dancing. Mewmans and monsters in the audience start swaying side to side.''
|-
!Eclipsa and Globgor
|♪ And all I wanna see ♪<br />♪ Is you right here next to me ♪

|''Camera zooms out from the Monster Auditorium. A crow flies through the sky. A scar on its right eye indicates that it's [[Mina Loveberry]]'s crow Sebastian.''
