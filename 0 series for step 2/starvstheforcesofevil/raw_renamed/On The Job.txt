|''Scene opens on Mewni. The camera jumps to Buff Frog's house, where he takes care of his tadpole babies. As he opens a pot to feed them dinner, Buff Frog realizes the pot is empty, and he has no food for them. Buff Frog frowns.''
|-
![[Buff Frog]]
|[opens phone] Call Boo Fly.
|-
![[Boo Fly]]
|Hey, Buff Frog! Long time no see man! I heard you have kids now.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Yes. 12 beautiful babies. Very hungry. I hear you're hiring for a job.
|-
!Boo Fly
|Are you sure you're up for it? You've been out of the game for a while.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oh, don't worry about me. I am just as evil as ever. Hmm. Hehehe. [rocks his children in their cradles]
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to the Diaz's home. Buff Frog hands off his babies for [[Star Butterfly]] and [[Marco Diaz]] to babysit. ''
|-
!Marco
| It'll be just fine. Star and I got this handled.
|-
!Star
| Just like a suitcase. Totally handled.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Okay. Daddy will come get you after work. Six o'clock sharp. Be good and listen to babysitters.
|-
!
|''The portal closes, leaving Buff Frog back on Mewni.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|[bawls loudly] Come on. Pull yourself together man. Who's more evil than you? Nobody! [grunts and shouts] Hiya! Hya! Hya! Hya! [runs off to work]
|-
!
|''In another part of the Mewni forest.''
|-
![[Dogbull]]
|Buff Frog?
|-
!Boo Fly
|Buff Frog.
|-
!Dogbull
|Buff Frog Buff Frog?
|-
!Boo Fly
|Buff Frog Buff Frog.
|-
!Dogbull
|The Buff Frog?
|-
!Buff Frog
|[arriving] Actually, it's Yvgeny Bulgolyubov.
|-
!Dogbull
|What?
|-
!Boo Fly
|Guys, welcome the newest member of our team.
|-
!Dogbull
|This guy? Look a little... soft. To me.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Soft⁈ [grunts and snarls]
|-
!Porcupine
|Ooh.
|-
!Dogbull
|He's just like me. Ah, whatever. Last time he got his hands dirty, he was changing diapers. Heh-heh.
|-
!Buff Frog
|[grabs Dogbull] You want me to change your diaper?
|-
!Dogbull
|[gasps, growls]
|-
!Boo Fly
|Guys! Guys, guys, guys. We're all on the same team here. We have work to do.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to outside the rat's lodge. A rat sneaks out of the door. The team of villains watches as another rat gives it an ear of corn. ''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Corn!
|-
!Boo Fly
|Corn!
|-
!Buff Frog
|Wait. Only Mewmans have corn. How rats have corn when monsters are starving?
|-
!Boo Fly
|That's what we're here to find out.
|-
!Buff Frog
|In that case, let's get show on road.
|-
!Both
|Thumpie-bumpies!
|-
!Buff Frog
|Okay, here is plan. A) We capture rat. B) Make him tell us where he got corn.
|-
!Dogbull
|Well, great. I'll just go grab him!
|-
!Buff Frog
|No, no. Give your abs a break. We must do this quietly. Let me teach you about the element of surprise. [hops into air]
|-
!Boo Fly
|Aw yeah! Buff Frog's back!
|-
!
|''In a different part of a forest, a rat walks by itself, alone. It hears a rustling of leaves.''
|-
!Rat
|[squeaks]
|-
!Buff Frog
|Surprise!
|-
!
|''Buff Frog grabs the rat from above with both hands.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Ha! Hahaha. Okay, little guy. You and me will have little talk.
|-
!
|''Buff Frog's mind visualizes the rat as one of his children for a breif instant.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Huh? [drops the rat] Wait!
|-
!Dogbull
|What was that? Baby oil on your fingers? [laughs]
|-
!Boo Fly
|Umm, Buff Frog? Did that just happen?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Uhhh...
|-
!Dogbull
|Look what was in the Lost and Found. [holds up rat] Yeah, 'cause he lost it. And we found it! Right?
|-
!Dogbull, Porcupine, and Birdle
|[laughs]
|-
!Boo Fly
|Uuuhh... Hey, Buff Frog. Uh, why don't you show the team your patented interrogation technique? This guy's the best!
|-
!Buff Frog
|[chuckles nervously]
|-
!
|''Buff Frog holds out his hand over a table of various torture devices. ''
|-
!Buff Frog
|[to the rat] We will do this the easy way and the hard way. Easy for me, and hard for you.
|-
!Dogbull
|This is amazing!
|-
!Boo Fly
|He-heh. Told you he was good.
|-
!Buff Frog
|[approaching the rat with device] Where did you get the corn?
|-
!
|''Once again, Buff Frog imagines the rat as one of his tadpole children. ''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Uuhhh! [groans, recovers] This rat is tougher than I thought. You're not going to want to see this.
|-
!Dogbull
|Uuh, yeah I do!
|-
!Boo Fly
|No, no, no. Lets, uh, leave the master to his work. You know how artists are [chuckles]
|-
!
|''The monsters leave Buff Frog alone with the tied up rat.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|[whimpers, drops torture device] Ooh! What is happening to me? [to rat] I can't do this to you. Wait. What am I doing? [grabs rat] I know what you're thinking. You think I'm soft because I have children, don't you? [growls] I'll show you!
|-
!
|''Scene jumps to the other villains. They hear the rat squealing very loudly.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|[showing pictures] Oh, and can you believe Nadia here? Seriously. There ought to be a law against something that cute.
|-
!Rat
|[continues to scream]
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oooh! We should do live chat with them. I call Star right now. [pulls out phone]
|-
!Rat
|[screeches]
|-
!Buff Frog
|It's ringing!
|-
!Boo Fly
|[distantly] I'm telling you, he probably found all the corn by now.
|-
!
|''The monsters find Buff Frog with the rope untied and the rat nowhere to be found.''
|-
!Dogbull
|What did you just do⁈ You let him go⁈
|-
!Buff Frog
|Umm, yes. But...
|-
!Boo Fly
|It's all according to the plan. I've seen him do this a hundred times. It's a classic. Buff Frog interrogates the prisoner, then lets him go 'cause he's so freaked out that he'll lead us right to where the corn came from... technique. Am I right, B?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oh, yes. Yes, never fails.
|-
!Dogbull
|[picks up rope, sniffs] Well, I guess I can track his scent from here.
|-
!
|''The monsters follow Dogbull as he sniffs the ground, following the scent. Buff Frog and Boo Fly stay behind.''
|-
!Boo Fly
|Hey, Bruh, are you good? 'Cause, um... that didn't look good.
|-
!Buff Frog
|I know. I know! This should be easy... but nothing is feeling right.
|-
!Boo Fly
|You blow this again, I'm not gonna be able to cover for you.
|-
!Buff Frog
|No, no. I got this.
|-
!
|''The monsters gather back together, looking over the edge of a cliff.''
|-
!Dogbull
|Jackpot.
|-
!
|''They see a line of rats marching with corn strapped to their backs.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Yes, but this is not the source. Is only supply route.
|-
!Dogbull
|Hey Buff-Daddy. You with us or what?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Yes. One hundred percent.
|-
!Dogbull
|Okay, guys. Quiet...
|-
!
|''All the monsters quietly arm themselves. Buff Frog pulls out his weapons, except that he accidentally grabs some baby toys which start playing baby music loudly. The monsters stare at him blankly. ''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Uuh... Umm...
|-
!Dogbull
|Shh!
|-
!Buff Frog
|[stamping on toys] Ay. Ay. Ay.
|-
!Dogbull
|Stop it!
|-
!
|''The rats scatter as Buff Frog attempts to destroy the toys. Dogbull picks them up and throws them far away.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|That was Katrina's favorite...
|-
!Dogbull
|[grabs Buff Frog, growls]
|-
!Boo Fly
|Guys guys guys! Keep your cool.
|-
!Dogbull
|Now, we're gonna do this my way. We follow the supply route back to the source, and we'll be swimming in delicious corn!!!
|-
!All
|Corn!
|-
!Boo Fly
|[to Buff Frog] No no. Not you.
|-
!Buff Frog
|[whimpers]
|-
!Boo Fly
|Alright. Everyone else, move out!
|-
!Buff Frog
|Wait! Boo Fly. Please! I need one more chance.
|-
!Boo Fly
|Just go home man.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Thumbie-bumpie?
|-
!Boo Fly
|No man. No thumpie-bumpie. [flies away]
|-
!
|''Buff Frog's phone rings. He pulls it out, revealing a picture of his kids with the message "Good luck with your new job. We're counting on you!" Buff Frog starts crying. The rest of the monsters continue on their quest.''
|-
!Dogbull
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''They have found the source of the corn; it is a Mewni corn field. Screaming, they all run towards the fields only to crash into a force field surrounding it.''
|-
!Dogbull
|No! Stupid Mewmans! [slams fists on field, notices a hole] Huh? Green hole?
|-
!
|''He tries to stick his hand through to grab some corn, but it's too far away. ''
|-
!Boo Fly
|You can't fin in there. You need to try something small–
|-
!Dogbull
|[grabs Boo Fly, tries to push him through]
|-
!Boo Fly
|Hey!
|-
![[King Butterfly]]
| [inside castle] Corn, corn, corn. Ha ha! Corn! Corn! Corn! [hears something] Huh? [looks outside, sees monsters] My corn!
|-
!Dogbull
|Come on man, suck in your gut!
|-
!King
|You there, monsters! Get away from my corn!!
|-
!
|''The king launches a fireball. While it does not directly landing on the monsters, it magically surrounds them in a circle of flame.''
|-
!King
|Whoopsie!
|-
!Monsters
|[gasp]
|-
!Birdle
|No! [pulls into shell] Later.
|-
!Dogbull
|We're toast!
|-
!
|''The fire roars loudly. When all hope is lost, Boo Fly looks up to see Buff Frog leaping in from the sky.''
|-
!Boo Fly
|I thought you went home.
|-
!Buff Frog
|We are all going home [grabs them, hops out of the flames]
|-
!
|''They land in a fiery explosion some distance way.''
|-
!Dogbull
|My ab! My ab!! I'm missing an ab! [ab creaks into place] Oh, thank corn.
|-
!Boo Fly
|Thanks, Buff Frog!
|-
!Dogbull
|Oh! I was wrong, man!
|-
!Porcupine
|Thank you for saving us.
|-
!Birdle
|Sorry we were mean.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Just doing my job.
|-
!Dogbull
|[extends hand] I'm never making fun of dads again!
|-
!Buff Frog
|[opens his arms] Aww, c'mere my little pierogies! [hugs them all]
|-
!Dogbull
|Come here.
|-
!Boo Fly
|Oh!
|-
!Dogbull
|Yeah, come on now.
|-
!Boo Fly
|I don't want to ruin a moment, but um... we didn't get any corn.
|-
!Buff Frog
|True. We did not get corn. But mission not a failure. We found hole in Mewman force field that they did not know was there. We just need a way to get in through that hole [opens portal with scissors]
|-
!Boo Fly
|If anyone can do it, you can!
|-
!Buff Frog
|Now, I must get babies. [gasps happily] Daddy missed you so much, my little kreplachs! [portal closes]
|-
!Dogbull
|Know what? I'm gonna call my dad.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to some rats. They are taking corn from a field, bringing it to a greenly lit cave, and dumping it at the feet of Ludo, perched on his spider and bird.''
