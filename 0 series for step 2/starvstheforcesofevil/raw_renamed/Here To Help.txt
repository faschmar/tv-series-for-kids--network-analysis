|''Episode begins in New Monstertown. [[Princess Spiderbite]], [[Slime Monster]], and Slime Monster's parents come out of a small house.''
|-
![[Princess Spiderbite|Penelope Spiderbite]]
|Thanks again, Mr. Slime, for the slime meringue pie. It was perfect. Not too much meringue.
|-
!Mr. Slime
|Glad you could come by, Princess Spiderbite. Sorry about the, uh... invasion.
|-
!
|''Heavy footsteps thud off-screen.''
|-
!Penelope and Slimes
|[panicked sounds]
|-
!
|''[[Mina Loveberry]] appears leading an army of Solarian Warriors.''
|-
!Penelope and Slimes
|[scream, run back into house]
|-
![[Mina Loveberry]]
|[motions army to stop] Wait! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, hold up! [lifts helmet visor] What happened to Doug-Doug?
|-
!
|''Doug-Doug, the Solarian Warrior that [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]] destroyed with the Spell With No Name in "[[The Right Way]]", is seen, his armor and the nearby trees still sizzling with purple energy.''
|-
!Solarian Warrior
|[deep voice] Doug-Doug looks pretty gone-gone if you ask me. [laughs]
|-
!Mina
|[raises fist]
|-
!Solarian Warrior
|Oh, no. No-no-no. [lowers visor]
|-
!Mina
|[punches Solarian Warrior's face] Go check his helmet! Well, boys,
it looks like Eclipsa wants to get weird.
|-
!
|''A cockerel is seen on one of the sizzling tree stumps.''
|-
!Mina
|I can get weird, too!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the Monster Temple. [[Star Butterfly|Star]], Eclipsa, [[Marco Diaz|Marco]], and [[Janna Ordonia|Janna]] run inside the temple.''
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|Archibald, close the gate!
|-
!Archibald
|Yes, milady! [pulls lever to close temple gate]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Where's [[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]]?
|-
!
|''Mina and her army reach the base of the temple mountain.''
|-
!Sebastian
|[shrieks]
|-
!
|''Mina uses her armor pigtails like a helicopter to fly up to the temple.''
|-
!Mina
|[sing-song] Hellooooo! [leans on temple] Guess what! You're out of options, Princess!
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Mina!
|-
!Mina
|I'm givin' you 'til the crow of this cockerel to surrender Eclipsa and her [[Globgor|husband]].
|-
!
|''Mina sets the cockerel from earlier down on top of the temple gate.''
|-
!Mina
|And don't even think about trying any more of that magic blasty funny business like you did to Doug-Doug! [flies away]
|-
!Star
|Mina! Get back here and fight! I'm gonna knock the cheese right off your cracker, you... you no-good helicopter head!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Star, I appreciate your fighting spirit, but I don't know if I have the energy to do that spell again.
|-
!Star
|[laughs] Yeah, that's right! You're not doing that spell again! That thing was insane! I mean, kudos on taking out that Solarian Warrior, but you decimated everything around it.
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|So is that rooster gonna crow at sunrise or something?
|-
!Star
|What? No. It's a dumb bird, Marco. It crows whenever it wants. And when it does, we'll have to be ready for Mina.
|-
![[Meteora Butterfly]]
|Beh! Beh! [drops teddy bear]
|-
!Eclipsa
|[picks up teddy bear] Here, sweetie. Here's your Beh.
|-
!Meteora
|[pushes teddy bear away] Beh!
|-
!
|''Star and Eclipsa look to the sky. An eagle swoops down toward the temple.''
|-
!Star and Eclipsa
|Aah!
|-
!
|''Star and Eclipsa jump out of the way as the eagle flies into the temple. [[Moon Butterfly|Moon]] and [[River Butterfly|River]] appear riding on the eagle's back. Moon jumps from the eagle's back and lands on the floor. River falls flat on his face.''
|-
![[Moon Butterfly|Moon]]
|Star?
|-
!Star
|Mom?! You came! [runs up to Moon and hugs her] Did you see them, Mom? Those soldiers are everywhere! We defeated one of them, but it took everything we had!
|-
!
|''Moon looks around to the other people inside the temple.''
|-
!Moon
|I'm here to help.
|-
!
|''In one of the temple rooms, all of Star's friends that were scarred by Doug-Doug's Solarian Sword lie on beds, and they are cared for by nurses.''
|-
![[Talon Raventalon]]
|[moans]
|-
![[Jorby]]
|[licks his scar]
|-
!Moon
|Oh, dear. Okay, well, this can be treated. We need to figure out how to get the glow-wounded to the [[Magic Sanctuary]].
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Meteora's bedroom. River enters. Globgor is still lying in bed.''
|-
![[River Butterfly]]
|Globgor, old boy! [laughs] I heard you were up here! Thought you could use a good old Dad hang.
|-
![[Globgor]]
|[groans] Is my family okay?
|-
!
|''The magic scar on Globgor's body glows.''
|-
!River
|They're... fine, yes. [clears throat] Moon-Pie has everything well in hand. Uh, she always knows what's right. ...You know what you need? Some meat! Yes! Fix you up right as rain! [laughs]
|-
!Globgor
|[groans]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the temple meeting room. Star, Marco, Eclipsa, Meteora, Moon, [[Buff Frog]], [[Lady Whosits]], Sir Dashing of Muscleton, Archibald, and the giraffe royal guard are gathered around a circular table.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|All right, everyone. So... yes, we threw everything we had at the first Solarian Warrior, and now there are maybe a hundred more. We need ideas.
|-
!Sir Dashing of Muscleton
|Oh! Eclipsa, why don't you do that sweet thing again? You know, that... with your wand t-thing? [makes magic sounds] You know, that--
|-
!Star
|She's not doing that again.
|-
!Eclipsa
|That was too dangerous.
|-
!Sir Dashing
|Uh, I thought it was rad.
|-
![[Buff Frog]]
|My ancestors fought the Solarian Warriors. Now is my turn.
|-
!Marco
|Whoa. They fought those things? How'd they do?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Eh, bad. Very bad. Everyone die. Total shame.
|-
!River
|[walks past in background] Ah! [muttering]
|-
!Moon
|River? Where are you going?
|-
!River
|I'm going to get that man some meat! He is a king, for corn's sake!
|-
!Eclipsa
|He's a vegetarian!
|-
!River
|Fine! I'll get him some chicken!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Moon, can I have a quick word?
|-
!
|''Eclipsa walks off-screen. Moon and Star look at each other confused. Moon shrugs her shoulders before following Eclipsa.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|(''o.s.'') Oh, come on, you stupid thing!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa rattles a Snookers vending machine with her backside.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[growls] Oh, come on!
|-
!Moon
|Eclipsa, how about I hold the baby while you... do that?
|-
!
|''Eclipsa hangs off the side of the vending machine.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|No, it's fine, thanks! [straining]
|-
!Moon
|What did you want to talk about?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Ugh. It looks even more stuck now. How did it get more stuck? Oh, sorry. Okay. As you heard, I used a spell on that first warrior. It was... It was quite destructive.
|-
!Moon
|I saw the damage. It's a good thing no one was harmed.
|-
!Eclipsa
|No one except that warrior! [laughs]
|-
!Moon
|[forced chuckle]
|-
!Eclipsa
|I may have miscalculated a bit. I think I can give it another go.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa pushes Meteora inside the vending machine's "PUSH" slot.''
|-
!Meteora
|[giggles]
|-
!Eclipsa
|This time, I'll be more focused. I figure all I really need to do is take out Mina. That show of force may be enough to make an impression on the other warriors.
|-
!
|''Meteora crawls inside the vending machine, grabs a Snookers bar, crawls back out of the machine, and gives the Snookers to Eclipsa.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Thank you, sweetie! [to Moon] Fancy a Snookers?
|-
!Moon
|Thank you, no. Look, if you think using that spell again is a good idea--
|-
!Eclipsa
|[munching] Sorry. I'm a nervous eater. Mmm. I'm open to suggestions.
|-
!Moon
|Well, I'm not the queen, but if I were, I'd start by getting the people to safety, ''then'' deal with Mina.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, right! Good idea! All right, everyone! We have a plan. We need to get the people of Monstertown to safety. Buff Frog, prepare the glow-wounded for travel to the Magic Sanctuary. Sir Dashing, make sure we have enough provisions for all the evacuees.
|-
!Sir Dashing
|Just gonna weigh in one more time on doing that thing again.
|-
!
|''Silence.''
|-
!Sir Dashing
|I'll get the provisions ready. [walks away while making magic sounds]
|-
!Marco
|How can we help?
|-
!Star
|[grabs Marco's hand] Marco and I are gonna... take care of the pig goats!
|-
!Marco, Eclipsa, and Moon
|Pig goats?
|-
!Star
|Pig goats! Come on, Marco, let's go! [pulls Marco off-screen by the hand]
|-
!Marco
|Whoa!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Thank you for your guidance, Moon.
|-
!Moon
|Of course. [walks away]
|-
!Eclipsa
|Maybe once everyone's ready, we can sneak out through the canals. Or... I mean, I know Star wasn't a fan, but maybe I can use my Annihilation Spell again once everybody's safe.
|-
!
|''Moon pulls the lever by the temple gate to open it.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|What are you doing?! The warriors are out there!
|-
!Moon
|You and Globgor should surrender.
|-
!Eclipsa
|What?! Moon, w-what do you mean?
|-
!Moon
|Surrender now, and this is all over.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Star and Marco outside the pig goat stables.''
|-
!Marco
|So what are we doing exactly?
|-
!Star
|See, here's the thing. Pig goats are really dumb. They won't run from danger, so we gotta put them out to pasture so they don't end up trapped in here.
|-
!Marco
|Right. Uh, I guess what I mean is, this seems a little random. Shouldn't we help out with the evacuation?
|-
!Star
|Yeah. We probably should. [sits on wooden fence] It's just... I'm so overwhelmed, Marco. My friends came to help the kingdom, and then they got wounded, and it's all my fault.
|-
!Marco
|Yeah, but your mom said the Magic Sanctuary will fix 'em.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, I know what she said. It's just, this has been a lot to deal with. [sighs] I know. I'm bad. I'm bad! I'm a bad person, right? My friends are wounded, and I'm basically hiding.
|-
!
|''Marco smiles at Star.''
|-
!Marco
|Hiiii-YAH!
|-
!
|''Marco kicks the stable doors open.''
|-
!Pig Goats
|[bleating]
|-
!Star
|Marco, what was that for?
|-
!Marco
|You're not the only one who can kick in doors. Come on. Let's decompress. Show me how to get these pig goats to safety.
|-
!Star
|Okay, so you know that feeling when something is so adorable, you just need to ''smooooosh'' it?
|-
!Marco
|No.
|-
!Star
|So what you do is you just harness all that pent-up love and use it to give 'em a whack!
|-
!
|''Star smacks a pig goat on the backside, and it runs out of the stable.''
|-
!Pig Goat
|[squeals]
|-
!Star
|Easy peasy taco breezy!
|-
!Marco
|Okay, yeah, I'm not doing that.
|-
!Star
|It doesn't hurt them.
|-
!Marco
|It's not that.
|-
!
|''One of the pig goats stares at Marco with red eyes.''
|-
!Marco
|[whispers] I don't like their eyes.
|-
!Star and Marco
|[laughing]
|-
!Star
|Oh, Marco. You know... [sits on pig goat] I'm glad we're alone together, 'cause there's something I want to talk to you about. I remember what you said to me in the [[Realm of Magic|magic]].
|-
!Marco
|[poking pig goat] Uh... [laughs] Okay, well, you're gonna have to remind me what I said unless it's really weird, and then maybe I don't wanna know.
|-
!
|''Marco is about to sit on a pig goat's back, but it moves away, and Marco falls on the floor.''
|-
!Pig Goat
|[bleats]
|-
!Star
|[giggles]
|-
!Marco
|Oh, no. I... I said something weird, didn't I?
|-
!Star
|Uh...
|-
!Marco
|Look, that place was like... it was like a dream! T-Those were fragments of my subconscious mind! [laughs nervously] I don't wanna know!
|-
!Star
|Marco. You told me you loved me.
|-
!
|''There is a loud DRAMATIC STING in the musical score as Marco has a blank, wide-eyed stare.''
|-
!Marco
|Ah. Okay. [hyperventilates] Okay. Okay, okay.
|-
!
|''A pig goat backs up into Marco, and Marco sits on its back as it moves closer to Star. Marco covers his face with his hands.''
|-
!Star
|Maybe it was just a fragment of your subconscious mind, but--
|-
!Marco
|No, it's... It's not a fragment of anything. That's the whole Marco. You know the... the whole Blood Moon curse? That whole deal? Well, it's... it's baloney. I've felt like this since the beginning. I mean, I-I'm not a little boy. I know that you don't just fall in love at first sight.
|-
!Pig Goat
|[bleats]
|-
!Marco
|The way I feel has just gotten more intense since we first met.
|-
!
|''The pig goat chomps Marco's hoodie sleeve.''
|-
!Marco
|And it was intense at the start, and I know it's in the way.
|-
!Star
|In the way? Marco, why does it have to be bad?
|-
!Marco
|It is bad if ''you'' don't want it.
|-
!Star
|[grabs Marco's collar] Okay, can we kiss?
|-
!Marco
|Uhh... please.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco kiss for several seconds, then they pull away.''
|-
!Star
|Marco... I want you to love me... because ''I'' love ''you''.
|-
!
|''The pig goats surround Star and Marco.''
|-
!Star
|I think we have an audience.
|-
!Star and Marco
|[laugh]
|-
!Marco
|[whispers] The eyes! [normally] Maybe we ought to get back to the others.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, you're probably right.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to outside the stable.''
|-
!Marco
|(''o.s.'') Ha-yaah!
|-
!
|''The stable doors fly open, and the pig goats all run out. Star and Marco exit, with Star holding Marco's left arm.''
|-
!Star
|Well done, Mr. Diaz.
|-
!
|''Outside the Monster Temple, the cockerel is pacing back and forth and clucking. Inside the temple, Star and Marco enter, laughing and holding hands.''
|-
!Star
|No, I can. I really can.
|-
!Star and Marco
|[laugh, sigh]
|-
!Star
|What the?
|-
!
|''Moon and Eclipsa are locked in a magical confrontation. Eclipsa turns to face Star and Marco.''
|-
!Star
|What's going on?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[to Moon] Do you want to tell your daughter what you did, or should I?
|-
!
|''Moon's eyes stop glowing, and her expression softens.''
|-
!Star
|Mom... what did you do?
|-
!Moon
|First of all, this did ''not'' go down the way I intended.
|-
!Star
|Uh, I... What do you mean "intended"?! Are you... Are you working for Mina?!
|-
!Moon
|No. Mina's working for ''me''.
|-
!
|''Off-screen, the cockerel crows.''
