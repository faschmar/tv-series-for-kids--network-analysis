|''Episode begins on [[Mewni]], outside [[Butterfly Castle]]. An army of monsters is amassing weapons and building catapults for an invasion. Inside the castle, young [[Queen Butterfly|Moon Butterfly]], wearing a black robe, sits in her bedroom holding a picture of herself as a child and her mother [[Comet Butterfly]]. Behind her, Count Mildrew appears in her doorway.''
|-
!Mildrew
|Hey. I'm sorry, am I bothering you?
|-
!Moon
|No, Count Mildrew. I'm just—
|-
!Mildrew
|Mourning the loss of your mother? I understand.
|-
!Moon
|It's been a hard week, but I'm—
|-
!Mildrew
|[suddenly hugs Moon] There's no need to be strong. Deal with your feelings. We will handle everything else.
|-
!Royal aide
|Uh, Princess? Uh, uh, I mean, Queen Moon? There's a... a situation in the... in the situation room.
|-
!
|''Cut to the castle's "situation room", where [[Mina Loveberry]] interrogates Archduke Batwin in chains.''
|-
!Archduke Batwin
|I swear it wasn't my orders!
|-
!
|''Mina whips Batwin with her pigtails.''
|-
!Mina
|You shut up during your confession!
|-
!Moon
|[enters] Mina?
|-
!
|''Moon approaches a meeting room table where Mildrew, the [[royal guard babysitter]], [[Lekmet]], [[Rhombulus]], [[Omnitraxus Prime]], and [[Hekapoo]] are sitting.''
|-
!Moon
|What is going on?
|-
!
|''Mildrew pulls a chair out for Moon, but Moon pushes the chair back and then pulls it out herself before sitting down.''
|-
!Moon
|''What'' is going on?
|-
!Mina
|According to this ''dingus'' here, one of his mooks lammed off with half an army, and they're the ones who put your mama in a wooden nightgown! You know, they, uh... T-They put her on ice. Uh, drapes down in funtown.
|-
!Moon
|Thank you, Mina.
|-
!Mina
|Uh, sorry about your mama.
|-
!Batwin
|The queen and I were about to sign a peace treaty when one of my generals went rogue.
|-
!Mina
|Rogue wha-who?
|-
!Batwin
|He's known as... th-the "Lizard".
|-
!Rhombulus' right snake hand
|[stifling laugh] Sorry. I mean... the "Lizard".
|-
!Left snake hand
|Dude, don't laugh.
|-
!Rhombulus
|[whispering] Shut it, both of you!
|-
!Mina
|Put this guy in the caboose, and let's croak those toads!
|-
!Rhombulus
|I think we should go to war.
|-
!Mildrew
|Now is not the time!
|-
!Omnitraxus Prime
|And her magic isn't strong enough for war yet.
|-
!Hekapoo
|Especially against the lizards. They're indestructible.
|-
!Mina
|We need to go to war!
|-
!Hekapoo
|We need to sign the peace treaty!
|-
!Rhombulus
|Yelling feels really good right now!
|-
!
|''Everyone in the room starts yelling over each other while Moon looks exhausted.''
|-
![[King Butterfly|River Johansen]]
|Maybe w-we should let Moon decide. She is the queen.
|-
!
|''Moon smiles at River.''
|-
!Mildrew
|She just lost her mother, River. She needs time with her feelings.
|-
!
|''Everyone starts yelling at River, and he sinks into his collared shirt while blushing.''
|-
!Moon
|I am the queen now, so I will make the decision. My decision... is that I will make a decision at dawn.
|-
!
|''Everyone stares at Moon. Cut to Moon walking through the castle corridor.''
|-
!Moon
|Ugh. Why did I say "decision" so many times?
|-
!River
|[catches up with Moon] Queen Moon! I'm sorry I spoke out of place. I-I got you something.
|-
!
|''River gives Moon a leg of meat with the word "SORRY" carved in it.''
|-
!Moon
|Uh, what is this?
|-
!River
|It's an apology meat. It's how we [[Johansen family|Johansens]] apologize.
|-
!Moon
|[takes River's apology meat] It was a relief to know someone believed in me. Thank you.
|-
!River
|[blushes, backs away shooting finger guns] Hey! Anytime, pal! [turns around and walks away] Did I just call the queen "pal"?
|-
!
|''Moon returns to her bedroom and curls up in a ball on the floor.''
|-
!Moon
|Ugh! Oh, apology meat, what am I going to do?
|-
!
|''Moon hears muffled crying coming from the [[Magic Instruction Book|Book of Spells]]. She opens it and finds [[Glossaryck]] crying.''
|-
!Glossaryck
|[crying]
|-
!Moon
|Oh, Glossy, are you okay?
|-
!Glossaryck
|No! Your mama's gone! [sobbing]
|-
!Moon
|I know.
|-
!Glossaryck
|And she's never coming back! [sobbing]
|-
!Moon
|No, she isn't.
|-
!Glossaryck
|And I really liked her, too.
|-
!Moon
|I know you're upset. So am I. But right now, I really need your help. Things are bad. I-I have to decide between signing a peace treaty or waging a war.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Oh, yeah... [sniffles] That. I don't know. Just pick one. Sure it'll work out.
|-
!Moon
|That's not helpful at all.
|-
!Glossaryck
|Yeah, you're probably right. I'm in no condition to give advice. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go cry in your mama's chapter. [sobbing]
|-
!
|''Glossaryck turns the pages of the book to the skull lock on [[Eclipsa Butterfly]]'s chapter. Cut to the Crystal Dimension, where Moon and Rhombulus approach Eclipsa's crystal cage.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|Eclipsa's been crystallized for hundreds of years. I've got no idea what's gonna happen when we open this up.
|-
!Moon
|I can handle it.
|-
!
|''Rhombulus unfreezes Eclipsa's upper body.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|Hoo. Okay, I'm out. Uh, call if you need me! [runs away]
|-
!
|''Moon points her wand at Eclipsa in defense.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[deep gasp, gasping breaths] Ugh! [collapses]
|-
!Moon
|Oh, my gosh, I killed her!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[whispering] B... 4...
|-
!Moon
|What?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[shuddering] B... 4...
|-
!Moon
|"Before"? Before what?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[moves her eyes] B... 4...
|-
!
|''Moon looks behind her and sees a vending machine of snacks.''
|-
!Moon
|Oh, wait. You want the candy?
|-
!Eclipsa
|B4! B4, B4, B4!
|-
!Moon
|O...kay?
|-
!
|''Moon puts a coin in the vending machine and presses B4. The machine vends a "Snookers" candy bar. Moon feeds the candy bar to Eclipsa.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[chomp, noisy chewing] Ahhhh... [straining]
|-
!
|''Eclipsa pulls her right arm of her frozen glove, revealing a black forearm. She grabs the rest of the candy bar out of Moon's hand.''
|-
!Moon
|Aah!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[eating noisily] Mmm-mmmm! How long have I been here?
|-
!Moon
|Uh, like, three hundred years?
|-
!Eclipsa
|[coughs] Three hundred years?! [pauses, continues munching] So, you're the new queen?
|-
!Moon
|Yes, what of it?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, it's just you're far too young to be queen, unless... Oh, no. Unless your mother – is she...?
|-
!Moon
|[sniffles, nods]
|-
!Eclipsa
|I see. I lost my [[Solaria Butterfly|mother]], too, when I was not much older than you.
|-
!Moon
|Ever since Mom... Um, since I became queen, everybody's been looking to me to end the war and make all these big decisions, but I'm just a kid! I can't decide the fate of Mewni! [grabbing her hair] I can't even decide which boy I like!
|-
!Eclipsa
|I know how you feel.
|-
!Moon
|But that's not why I'm here. I need you to teach me one of the spells from your... forbidden chapter.
|-
!Eclipsa
|"Forbidden"? Is that what they're calling my chapter?
|-
!Moon
|Yeah, sorry. I didn't name it. But the point is I need a spell that can destroy something that's immortal.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Are you sure that's what you want?
|-
!Moon
|It's my only hope.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, the spell you seek requires a magical contract. I can give it to you. But once your enemy is killed, you must give me something in return.
|-
!Moon
|Okay, what do you want?
|-
!Eclipsa
|My freedom.
|-
!Moon
|What?!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, I know. It's a lot to ask. But... I've just been here so long, all by myself. I want to buy my own chocolate. Or those little shrink-wrapped muffins at the bottom. Mmm!
|-
!Moon
|But these are Rhombulus' crystals. I can't free you.
|-
!Eclipsa
|A contract between two queens is stronger than any crystal. Now, do you want to learn the spell?
|-
!
|''Eclipsa extends a hand to Moon. Moon takes Eclipsa's hand, and a magic black ribbon wraps around their hands. Both of their cheek marks start glowing. After a few moments, the ribbon vanishes, and their cheek marks stop glowing.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Come close. Now... [whispers in Moon's ear] ...and aim it directly at his heart.
|-
!
|''Rhombulus freezes Eclipsa again.''
|-
!Moon
|What was that for?
|-
!Rhombulus
|I'm just doing my job, your Majesty. Evil queen, gotta freeze it.
|-
!Moon
|She didn't seem so evil.
|-
!
|''Cut back to the castle situation room.''
|-
!Royal guard babysitter
|The queen is late.
|-
!River
|[points outside the window] Look!
|-
!
|''Moon rides on [[Lil Chauncey]]'s back toward the monster army outside the castle.''
|-
!Mildrew
|She's gone mad with grief! She was so young! [sobbing]
|-
!River
|She's not dead yet, you fool!
|-
!
|''The monsters see Moon approaching. Moon stops before the monsters and lays down a blanket. She takes out eating utensils, a goblet, and River's apology meat and starts to eat.''
|-
![[Rasticore]]
|Uh, can we help you?
|-
!Moon
|I wish to speak to the general.
|-
!Lizard monster
|The general?!
|-
!Monsters
|[laughing]
|-
![[Toffee]]
|(''o.s.'') Silence!
|-
!
|''Toffee emerges from behind a wall of skulls and approaches Moon.''
|-
!Toffee
|[bowing] Hello, Princess.
|-
!Moon
|I presume you're the one they call the "Lizard".
|-
!Toffee
|Yes, but you may call me... Toffee.
|-
!Moon
|Toffee? How is that any better?
|-
!Toffee
|What do you want?
|-
!Moon
|I want you and your army to leave immediately or face the consequences.
|-
!Rasticore
|Your mom couldn't defeat us, and neither can you!
|-
!Moon
|I was hoping you'd say that. [points her magic wand at Toffee]
|-
!Lizard monster 1
|We're not afraid of your little girl magic!
|-
!Rasticore
|We're invincible! Just watch!
|-
!
|''Rasticore holds out his left arm, and the first lizard monster opens his jaws around it.''
|-
!Moon
|No, wait! I already know about the—!
|-
!
|''The lizard monster bites off Rasticore's arm off-screen.''
|-
!Moon
|Ugh!
|-
!Rasticore
|[grunting]
|-
!
|''Rasticore grows a new left arm.''
|-
!Monsters
|[cheering]
|-
!Moon
|[closes her eyes] I call the darkness unto me from deepest depths of Earth and sea.
|-
!
|''In the Crystal Dimension, Eclipsa's cheek marks start glowing.''
|-
!Moon
|From ancient evils unawoken, break the one that can't be broken.
|-
!
|''Purple storm clouds start gathering over Moon and the monsters.''
|-
!Moon
|To blackest night, I pledge my soul and crush my heart to burning coal. 
|-
!
|''The top of Moon's magic wand becomes stained with black, and black veins appear along her arms.''
|-
!Moon
|To summon forth a deathly power, to see my hated foe devoured! [sees dark veins on her arms] Aah!
|-
!Toffee
|Enough of this.
|-
!
|''Toffee reaches out to grab Moon, but she fires an energy blast that severs his right hand's middle finger and knocks him over. In the Crystal Dimension, Eclipsa's cheek marks stop glowing. Toffee's severed finger disappears.''
|-
!Toffee
|Have you learned nothing?
|-
!
|''Toffee tries to regrow his severed finger, but the regenerating finger crumbles to black dust.''
|-
!Monsters
|[gasp]
|-
!One-horned monster
|It's not growing back!
|-
!
|''The monsters run away and scatter to the woods, screaming in terror.''
|-
!Toffee
|[grunts]
|-
!
|''Toffee stands up, dusts himself off, and walks away angry. River arrives on the back of a [[Warnicorns|warnicorn]].''
|-
!River
|Queen Moon! You did it!
|-
!Moon
|Oh, my gosh, River! [hugs him] Thank you!
|-
!
|''The [[Magic High Commission]] approaches Moon.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|What... did you just do?
|-
!Moon
|I did my job! And as your queen, I will continue to do my job of protecting this kingdom! I will hunt down the remains of the monster army and scatter them without country or leadership! Now, are there any questions?
|-
!
|''The members of Moon's royal court stare at her.''
|-
!Moon
|I didn't think so.
|-
!
|''Moon walks toward Butterfly Castle, and her court members bow to her.''
