|''The episode begins in [[Marco Diaz]]'s bedroom at the [[Diaz Household]]. Marco tells a bedtime story to [[Mariposa Diaz]] and [[Meteora Butterfly]], with a little penguin finger puppet to illustrate the story.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|[in a silly voice] And after the battle, they had all the breakfast burritos they could ever want.
|-
!
|''In a baby crib, Mariposa giggles and claps; Meteora stares blankly and drools.''
|-
!Marco
|[silly voice] The end.
|-
![[Mariposa Diaz]]
|[laughing]
|-
!Marco
|[normal voice] Okay, that's enough goofing off.
|-
!
|''Meteora gives Mariposa a piggyback ride. Marco takes Mariposa off of Meteora's back.''
|-
!Marco
|(''o.s'') Time for bed. Goodnight, Meteora.
|-
![[Meteora Butterfly]]
|[hisses at Marco, falls over] Goo!
|-
!Marco
|It's really great you two get along so well.
|-
!
|''Marco places Mariposa in her own crib.''
|-
!Marco
|[holding penguin finger puppet] Goodnight, Mariposa. [gives Mariposa the finger puppet] Sweet dreams.
|-
!
|''Marco watches his sister fall asleep. A [[dimensional portal]] opens behind him, and [[Hekapoo]] appears.''
|-
![[Hekapoo]]
|Marco.
|-
!
|''Marco turns around and assumes a defensive karate stance.''
|-
!Marco
|[whispering] Hekapoo? What the heck are you doing here?
|-
!Hekapoo
|I need to talk to you about the—
|-
!Marco
|[puts his finger over Hekapoo's mouth] Shh-shh! Not in front of the babies!
|-
!
|''Marco grabs Hekapoo by the arm, pushes her out of the room, and closes the door behind him.''
|-
!Marco
|[whispering] Mariposa and Meteora just fell asleep!
|-
!Hekapoo
|What are you? [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]'s babysitter?
|-
!Marco
|I am Eclipsa's FAVORITE babysitter, and I think it's nice that she and [[Globgor]] are having a night out after three hundred years—
|-
!Hekapoo
|Just listen, all right? I shouldn't even be telling you this, but I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down on [[Mewni]].
|-
!Marco
|Well, that sounds ominous.
|-
!Hekapoo
|Okay I know you like to [finger quoting] "get involved" because you "care", but trust me... [poking hard on Marco chest] Stay. On. Earth!
|-
!Marco
|Ow.
|-
!Hekapoo
|[reopens portal with her [[dimensional scissors]], goes inside, and returns briefly to repeat] Stay on Earth!
|-
!
|''Hekapoo's portal closes.''
|-
!Marco
|Ehh.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to [[Star Butterfly]] brushing her teeth in the bathroom. Marco enters.''
|-
!Marco
|Star! Hekapoo just gave me this really cryptic warning about bad things happening on Mewni. Have you hear anything about that?
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|[spits] Noooo... But we should probably ask Eclipsa that— Oh! I promised I'd send her a picture of the babies together! [runs out of the bathroom]
|-
!Marco
|[wispering] Quietly! They're asleep!
|-
!Star
|[singsong] Li'l babies!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco enter Marco's room, with Star holding her compact mirror.''
|-
!Star and Marco
|[gasp]
|-
!
|''The first portal Hekapoo appeared through is still open next to the babies' cribs.''
|-
!Star
|(''o.s.'') Hekapoo left her portal open!
|-
!Marco
|Why is it so quiet?
|-
!
|''Star and Marco look at each other nervously and walk up to the cribs.''
|-
!Marco
|[gasps]
|-
!Star
|Oh, my gosh!
|-
!
|''Both of the cribs are empty.''
|-
!Marco
|Do you think...?
|-
!
|''Star and Marco look at the open portal.''
|-
!Star
|Uh-huh. I think. Oh, no! How long has it been?!
|-
!Marco 
|I don't know! Five minutes?! Ten?!
|-
!Star
|They could be grandmas by now! Let's go!
|-
!
|''Star pulls Marco by the arm, and they go through the portal. Scene cuts to the Neverzone; a living cactus is seen eating a fairy. Marco appears through the portal in his adult form, and Star appears unchanged.''
|-
!Star
|What happened here?
|-
!Adult Marco
|Who knows? It's been centuries since we were last here.
|-
!Star
|Oh, hot Marco, where do we even start looking?
|-
!
|''Adult Marco squishes a fairy in his hands and smears its blood on a skull on the ground. The earth starts to shake, and lightning strikes all around them.''
|-
!Star
|[whimpering]
|-
!
|''[[Brunzetta]] appears in a bolt of lightning, kneeling with her axe. She stands up and opens her eyes. Star runs up to give her a hug.''
|-
!Star
|Ahhh! Brunzetta! You look so cool! Duh! [chuckles] Did you missed me?
|-
![[Brunzetta]]
|I'm sorry, who are you again?
|-
!
|Star's face freezes in a smile, and her cheek hearts crack.''
|-
!Adult Marco
|Brunzetta! My sister is missing! Do you know anyone that can help me find her?
|-
!Burnzetta
|Hmm... Old Irma! The sage who lives just pass the mountian range. We can get there by midday if leave now.
|-
!Adult Marco
|Oh. Uh... we've loved to have you Brunzetta, but this is kind of a family affair.
|-
!Brunzetta
|Wait. Did you summon me all the way out here just to ask for directions?
|-
!Adult Marco
|No! I-I also... One thing that I...
|-
!
|''Marco suddenly runs off-screen. There's a poof sound off-screen, and Star and Marco take off toward the mountains on top of [[Cloudy]].
|-
!Adult Marco
|I value your friendship!
|-
!Brunzetta
|[aside] Rude.
|-
!
|''Brunzetta taps her axe on the ground and vanishes in another bolt of lightning. Scene cuts to Star and Marco on Cloudy's back.''
|-
!Adult Marco
|Ugh! How could I be so irresponsible?! This is no place for babies!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco are attacked by giant flying bugs. Marcoes punch one away, and Star uses her magic to blast away another.''
|-
!Adult Marco
|I'm a terrible brother.
|-
!Star
|Cliff.
|-
!
|''Cloudy pulls up to avoid the cliff face. At the top of the cliff, Cloudy vanishes, and Star and Marco land on their feet.''
|-
!Old Irma
|(''o.s.'') Who's there?
|-
!
|''Screen pans across a large mountain campsite, with a campfire, weapons, hanging clothes, a tent, and various bones. A large figure wearing oversized clothes made of fabric and leaves is seen sitting in a rocking chair made of bones.
|-
!Adult Marco
|Old crone, we come in search of two girls. One a half-monster with clovers on her cheeks, the other a human girl with a mole like this. [points to his mole] Have you seen them?
|-
!Old Irma
|Who wants to know?
|-
!Adult Marco
|I'm mole girl's older brother. [points at Star] And she's the half-monster's... distant... cousin... or something.
|-
!Star
|[gives Marco a thumbs-up]
|-
!
|''Old Irma jumps out of her rocking chair toward Star and Marco and starts charging green magic energy between her hands.''
|-
!
Star
|Hey, she knows mag—! [gets blasted with some green magic sludge] Aah! Oof!
|-
!Old Irma
|[cackles]
|-
!
|''Old Irma appears to shed an outer layer of skin, revealing a smaller teenage form with six arms and wearing a skull helmet. She takes flight into the air, revealing large, purple butterfly wings on her back.''
|-
!Star
|[gasp] Is that...a Butterfly?!
|-
!
|''A teenage Mariposa appears riding on "Old Irma"'s back.''
|-
!Adult Marco
|Mariposa?
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Intruders! Prepare to meet your demise!
|-
!
|''"Old Irma" blasts more green magic at Marco...''
|-
!Adult Marco
|Aah!
|-
!
|...but Star jumps in and uses her own magic to fire back at them.''
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|[grunts] Wait! You're a magic user, too?
|-
!Star
|Yeah...
|-
!
|''Mariposa and "Old Irma" float down to the ground. "Old Irma"'s wings disappear, and she takes off her skull helmet, revealing teenage Meteora.''
|-
!Teen Meteora
|We don't see many of your kind here.
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Meteora!
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|What if they're telling the truth? That guy and I do have the same mole.
|-
!Teen Meteora
|Hmm... I called for a sister meeting.
|-
!
|''Meteora and Mariposa turn away from Star and Marco and have a private conversation. Star and Marco look at each other in mild confusion.''
|-
!Teen Meteora
|Ugh! Fine!
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|[to Star and Marco] Greetings. I'm Bork... [puts her arm on Meteora] ...and this is Grobb.
|-
!Adult Marco
|Those... aren't your real names.
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Please allow us to properly apologize by offering you some food. [chuckles] Our cave is this way.
|-
!Star 
|Food! Ho-ho! Don't mind if I do!
|-
!
|''Star follows Mariposa. Marco tries to follow as well, but Meteora steps in front of him.''
|-
!Adult Marco
|Uhh... can I... help you?
|-
!Teen Meteora
|I don't know why... but something about you... makes me angry!
|-
!Adult Marco
|[laughs nervously] Yeah...
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Mariposa and Meteora's cave. Star, Marco, Mariposa, and Meteora sit around a boiling cauldron.''
|-
!Star
|That was some pretty sweet magic you used back there.
|-
!Teen Meteora
|Oh, thanks. The old women of the mountain found us as babies and taught me all of their spells. Now that they've all died, it's my job to protect us, since "Bork" cannot do magic.
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|[looks sad]
|-
!Teen Meteora
|She still can kick butt though! Like the time you wrestle that giant mud-fly!
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|I chopped all the legs and drained the putrid goo from its body! And then it kind of exploded. But I manage to save the goo!
|-
!Teen Meteora
|[sighs] That was the last good meal we had that winter.
|-
!Adult Marco
|Yeah. It's not easy surviving in this dimension.
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Why did you abandoned us here?
|-
!Adult Marco
|We didn't abandon you! We came soon as we could, but time works differently here.
|-
!Star
|We're here now though! You can finally come home!
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Oh, yeah. [chuckles] I can't wait to see what Earth is like.
|-
!Teen Meteora
|But first, soup's on! Who's hungry? [grabs wooden bowl and cauldron ladle]
|-
!Star
|Oh, oh, oh! Me, me, me! It's me! I'm hungry! [takes bowl from Meteora] ...What is this?
|-
!
|''Star's bowl is filled with sickly green stew, skin flakes, and bugs.''
|-
!Teen Meteora
|(''o.s.') Skin flakes and garlic spider chow!
|-
!Star
|[hesitantly slurps and gulps the soup] Y-Yummy.
|-
!Adult Marco
|[eagerly drinks the soup] Ahhh! Really takes me back. Though I always used to add more garlic spiders. Ugh!
|-
!
|''Star and Marco fall to the ground, unconscicous. Mariposa and Meteora stand over them and smile at each other. Scene cuts to Mariposa and Meteora climbing up the moutain and carrying Star and Marco on their backs.''
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|[grunts] You sure this will work?
|-
!Teen Meteora
|It better! [heh!]
|-
!
|''Screen pans up to the top of the mountain. There is a magical, floating door with various symbols on it. Mariposa and Meteora reach the top of the mountain, out of breath.''
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|[sighing] So heavy. [sets Marco down on the ground] Wyscan the Granter! We summon you!
|-
!
|''The large doorway opens, and a magical being with blue skin, long bluish-white hair, and an effeminate appearance materializes.''
|-
!Wyscan the Granter
|Come for a trade, girls?
|-
!Teen Meteora
|We captured a magical creature.
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|We'll give it to you in exchange for giving me magical powers, just like Grobb.
|-
!Wyscan
|[crosses his legs] What an intriguing proposal. Very well. Feed me the magic girl.
|-
!
|''Wyscan lifts up his shirt, revealing another mouth on his stomach.''
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Ugh!
|-
!Teen Meteora
|Okey-dokey. [picks up Star and walks over to Wyscan]
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! He's just gonna eat her?
|-
!Teen Meteora
|Well, yeah. Seems pretty straightforward. Magic girl goes in, magic powers come out.
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Yeah, but I didn't think it would be so.. I don't know... creepy!
|-
!Adult Marco
|Mariposa! You don't need magic. You need to come home with me!
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|I'm not going anywhere with you! You're not my brother!
|-
!Adult Marco
|Even if I weren't, this is wrong. I think you know that.
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|...
|-
!Wyscan
|Ugh! What's taking so long over there?!
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|I've changed my mind.
|-
!Wyscan
|I thought we had a deal!
|-
!Wyscan's Stomach
|And baby's hungry! [slurping]
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|You want the girl... [pulls out a bo staff] ...you'll have to fight us for her!
|-
!Wyscan
|Ugh, fine. Come at me, or whatever.
|-
!Teen Meteora
|I've got this!
|-
!
|''Meteora shoots magic at Wyscan, but his stomach opens up to absorb to eat the magic blast.''
|-
!Wyscan's Stomach
|[burps]
|-
!Wyscan
|Oops! Pardon my manners.
|-
!Teen Meteora
|What?!
|-
!Star
|I've got it! Cupcake Blast!
|-
!
|''Star shoots a blast of cupcakes at Wyscan, but agai, his stomach opens up to absorb to eat the magic blast.''    
|-
!Wyscan
|Oooh! [chuckles] Strawberry!
|-
!Adult Marco
|[steps in front of Star] Stop! He eats magic! We have to beat him the old fashion way!
|-
!Wyscan
|Oh, the old-fashioned way, hmm?
|-
!
|'''Wyscan reached into his stomach's mouth, pulled out two swords, and strikes a fighting pose.''
|-
!Wyscan
|Don't mind if I do!
|-
!Adult Marco
|Let's go!
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|[runs past Marco with a war cry]
|-
!Adult Marco
|Mariposa!
|-
!
|''Mariposa starts to fight Wyscan with her staff. Wyscan blocks her attacks and pushes her backward with his swords. He quickly knocks her away and pins her to the ground.''
|-
!Wyscan
|Ooh, you're fun!
|-
!Adult Marco
|[runs up to Wyscan with war cry]
|-
!
|''Marco charges into the battle and fights Wyscan with his single sword. Mariposa joins in and fights Wyscan alongside Marco.''
|-
!Teen Meteora
|[watching the fight] You know, Bork actually kicked my butt once.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, Marco's pretty tough, too.
|-
!
|''Wyscan knocks both Marco and Mariposa to the ground. Garlic spiders appear crawling on Marco's face.''
|-
!Adult Marco
|Huh? Hey. [whispers to Mariposa]
|-
!Wyscan
|Oh, oh, oh, oh! Something you'd like to share with the class? Don't keep me waiting now.
|-
!
|''Marco and Mariposa nod to each other, and Mariposa charged in. Mariposa runs circles around Wyscan.''
|-
!Wyscan
|Hey! Stand still!
|-
!
|''Mariposa traps Wyscan by putting her staff around his ars.''
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Now!
|-
!Adult Marco
|Hope you like garlic spiders!
|-
!
|''Marco shoves a handful of garlic spiders into the mouth of Wyscan's stomach. Its face turns green, then Wyscan's face turns green.''
|-
!Wyscan
|Ugh!
|-
!
|''Wyscan drops his swords and falls to his knees. Marco and Mariposa point their weapons at him. Wyscan laughs, and Marco and Mariposa raise their eyebrows.''
|-
!Wyscan
|I actually rather like garlic.
|-
!
|''Wyscan teleports in front of the large, wide-open doorway, holding his stomach with indigestion.''
|-
!Wyscan
|Spiders, on the other hand, ruin everything! [groans] Take your magic girl and go, you awful children. They're still crawling! Why?!
|-
!
|''The large doorway closes and vanishes in a flash of light.''
|-
!Marco and Mariposa
|Yeah! [laugh]
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Not bad, dude!
|-
!Adult Marco
|Not bad yourself, sis! [tries to hug Mariposa]
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Watch it! You may be a good fighter, but you're still not my brother!
|-
!Adult Marco
|What's... What's that on your necklace?
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Mariposa is wearing a necklace with the penguin finger puppet Marco gave her when she was baby, worn with age. Marco grabs the puppet and puts it on his finger.''
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Hey!
|-
!Adult Marco
|And after the battle, they had all the breakfast burritos...
|-
!Marco and Mariposa
|...they could ever want!
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|[gasps] You ARE my brother!
|-
!Adult Marco
|Come home, Mariposa. We can be a family again.
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|A family?
|-
!Teen Meteora
|Wait, wait, wait! Does this mean we'll turn back into babies?
|-
!Adult Marco
|Well... yeah, but... you'll have loving parents, a safe home to grow up in.
|-
!
Star
|And Grobb, you get to live in a castle! With servants, and a [[Sir Lavabo|weird knight who does all your laundry]]!
|-
!Teen Meteora
|But... we don't need a castle.
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|And I already have a home. Grobb and I have built a life together, and I don't want to lose that.
|-
!Teen Meteora
|[puts hand on Mariposa's shoulder] Yeah. Thanks for coming here and all, but I think we're gonna pass.
|-
!
|''Meteora and Mariposa turn around and start walking away.''
|-
!Star
|Marco, what are we gonna do?
|-
!Adult Marco
|I... I don't know. [his eyes widen] W-What about food?!
|-
!Mariposa and Meteora
|[turn back around] Huh?
|-
!Adult Marco
|We, uh,  got all kinds of food.
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|You got, like, different flavors of spiders? 
|-
!Star
|You don't have to eat spiders where we're going! You can eat waffles, nachoes, sushi...
|-
!Adult Marco
|If you wanted to, you could eat breakfast burritos all day!
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Wait a minute. Breakfast burritos are food?
|-
!Star
|If you come home with us, you'll have all the food you could ever dream of!
|-
!Mariposa and Meteora
|[blushing and drooling, look at each other]
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|Will we get to grow up together again? 
|-
!Star
|We'll make sure of it.
|-
!
|''Meteora and Mariposa join hands.''
|-
!Teen Mariposa
|...Let's go home.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to Diaz Household. Meteora, reverted back to an infant, sleeps happily in her crib.''
|-
!Marco
|[whispering] Good night, Meteora. Good night, Mariposa.
|-
!Mariposa
|[cooing]
|-
!
|''Marco gives Mariposa the finger puppet, and she cuddles with it to sleep.''
