|''Episode begins in the [[Mewni]] marketplace. [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]] browses a rack of T-shirts while [[Star Butterfly|Star]] looks at some toy wands.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Whoa.
|-
!Teen Monster
|Yeah, that princess merch is, like, so cute, but for that price, I'm, like, it better do real magic.
|-
!Star
|[laughs] That is funny and a good point.
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|[holding red T-shirt in front of him] Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! This one's spicy!
|-
!Star
|Oh, my gosh, that is the cutest price tag.
|-
!Store Owner
|[to Teen Monster] Hey, monster! You know the rules! Monsters ain't welcome, so put the merch back and get out!
|-
!Star
|Whoa.
|-
!Store Owner
|[prods monster with broom] Shoo, shoo, shoo!
|-
!Teen Monster
|[runs away crying]
|-
!Tom
|Do you think I'd look cute in this shirt?
|-
!Star
|What?
|-
!Tom
|Or... [reaches down for a different T-shirt]
|-
!Store Owner
|[to Tom] Hey, over there! That goes for you, too! Monster!
|-
!Tom
|[stands up and glares] Hmph!
|-
!Store Owner
|[gasps] Oh! Prince Lucitor! [kneels in front of Tom] Sorry. Sorry, sir. Please don't incinerate my shop. [kisses Tom's hand]
|-
!Star
|Hmmm...
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to [[Butterfly Castle]]. [[Queen Butterfly]] is in the library reading law books.''
|-
![[Queen Butterfly|Queen Moon]]
|Circumstantial evidence... Hmm, okay. Hmm.
|-
!
|''Fast footsteps are heard approaching from outside.''
|-
!Moon
|No.
|-
!Star
|[kicks library door open] Hey, Mom!
|-
!Moon
|[strained groaning]
|-
!Star
|You know how [[Mewmans]] kind of keep monsters separated from the rest of the kingdom?
|-
!Moon
|Yes?
|-
!Star
|Well, I was just wondering – why?
|-
!Moon
|We keep monsters out because monsters are dangerous. You know that.
|-
!Star
|Well, yeah. But-but no! No-no-no-no-no! Not all of them. And what about people who aren't Mewmans but also aren't monsters? Like [[Rhombulus]]. He has snakes for hands. Are his hands monsters?
|-
!Moon
|Heavens, no! He's on the [[Magic High Commission|Magical High Commission]]!
|-
!Star
|And what about the [[Pony Head family|Pony Heads]]? They're a bunch of floating horse heads!
|-
!Moon
|No, dear. We've had ties with the Pony Heads for generations.
|-
!Star
|And Rich Pigeon? His kingdom is brand-new! And he's a pigeon with legs, Mother! How is he not a monster?
|-
!Moon
|Well, dear, he's rich.
|-
!Star
|I don't really see what that has to do with anything. And what about the Lucitors? I've seen Tom do some pretty scary stuff. Somehow he's not a monster? Okay, and it makes absolutely no sense that lizard people are monsters but [[Lekmet]], the giant magical goat-man, was not.
|-
!Moon
|Too soon, Star!
|-
!Star
|But what's the difference?! What the heck is the difference?!
|-
!Moon
|Enough! Look, I don't make the rules. The Royal Monster Expert does.
|-
!Star
|I'm sorry, what? We have a monster on staff?
|-
!Moon
|Not a monster. A monster ''expert''. Dr. Jelly Goodwell.
|-
!Star
|Okay, then I'm gonna go have a little chat with this "Jelly Goodwell", if that even is her real name!
|-
!Moon
|Fine!
|-
!Star
|Fine! Bye! [slams library door]
|-
!Moon
|[sighs] What am I supposed to do with this cart?
|-
!
|''Star stomps through the castle and kicks in another door.''
|-
!Star
|Jelly Goodwell!
|-
!Brie Parmesan
|[screams]
|-
!Star
|We need to talk now!
|-
!Brie
|Oh, you must be here for the cheese! [holding a plate of cheese]
|-
!Star
|What? No! Don't play dumb with me, Royal Monster Expert!
|-
!Brie
|Oh! [giggles] No, I'm the Royal ''Muenster'' Expert.
|-
!
|''Star looks at the plaque on Brie Parmesan's door. It reads, "Brie Parmesan, Royal Muenster Expert".''
|-
!Brie
|The Royal ''Monster'' Expert is down the hall to the right.
|-
!Star
|[angrily] Okay! Thank you! [opens another hallway door] Jelly Goodwell!
|-
!
|''A large, muscular castle official looks up from his desk at Star.''
|-
!Muscular Employee
|Hmm?
|-
!Star
|Wrong office, sorry. [closes door, opens another one] Jelly Goodwell!
|-
!
|''A small horse is riding a castle guard like a horse.''
|-
!Horse
|And step... Step...
|-
!
|''The horse and guard look at Star.''
|-
!Star
|Excuse me. [closes door, opens another one] Pardon me, is this Dr. Goodwell's office?
|-
!Dr. Jelly Goodwell
|[holding large magnifying glass] Yes, I'm Dr. Goodwell.
|-
!Star
|Ah, thank goodness! Now, you listen up, Goodwell! The way we treat monsters around here is outrageous! We have got all these dumb rules saying monsters can't mingle with humans, and monsters can't go here, and monsters can't go there! [grunts] It's gotten to the point where a monster can't even go shopping for a pre-ripped T-shirt! Well, sister, I am not leaving here until you agree to make some changes.
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|[stands up] I've spent my entire life studying monsters. Nobody knows more about them than I do. I've even lived among them and observed their behavior firsthand, and you... are exactly the princess I've been waiting for!
|-
!Star
|Wait, what?
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|For years, I've hoped to find a royal who actually gets it. The way we treat monsters in Mewni is, well, monstrous!
|-
!Star
|Exactly!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Monsters need to be respected.
|-
!Star
|Yes!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|And loved!
|-
!Star
|Yes!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|And their habitat preserved!
|-
!Star
|Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Excellent. Let me take you out into the field and show you what I've been working on.
|-
!Star
|Let's go!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Star and Dr. Goodwell walking through Mewni in monster costumes.''
|-
!Star
|Being a researcher is awesome! These monster costumes are great!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|[chuckles] They're monster camouflage. Speaking of which, we should probably go ahead and apply our monster musk.
|-
!Star
|Monster musk? What's that?
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|[sprays Star with monster musk]
|-
!Star
|[sniffs] Oh, that is nasty! What's in there?
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|My own special blend of various monster secretions. [sprays musk into her mouth, gargles, spits] Let's get going! First we need to go through the Forest of Certain Death... then across the Lake of Endless Suffering... over the Dam of Constant Sorrow... across the Bridge of the Inevitable Hereafter... and here we are!
|-
!
|''After traveling through the above areas, Star and Dr. Goodwell arrive a small treehouse.''
|-
!Star
|Whoa, sick treehouse, doc!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Oh, no-no. [laughs] It's not a treehouse. It is my field research lab. [climbs treehouse ladder]
|-
!Star
|It looks like a treehouse to me.
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|(''o.s.'') It's not!
|-
!Star
|Whatever you say, doc.
|-
!
|''Star tries following Dr. Goodwell up the ladder, but her monster costume prevemts her from climbing.
|-
!Star
|Oh!
|-
!
|''Star removes her costume and climbs into the treehouse.''
|-
!Star
|[grunts] Dr. Goodwell? Whatcha doing?
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|[looking through binoculars] Shhh! There's a herd nearby!
|-
!Star
|A herd? A herd of what?
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Monsters!
|-
!
|''A large village of monsters is seen at the center of a small valley.''
|-
!Star
|Whoa.
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|[whispering] This hill features naturally occurring geographic formations that almost look like buildings. The monsters were clever enough to use them for shelter. Amazing!
|-
!Star
|[laughs] Wait, what?
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Ooh! Ooh! You've got to get a look at this!
|-
!
|''[[Buff Frog]] walks through the village with his [[Buff Frog's tadpoles|tadpoles]] in a baby stroller.''
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|There's 011358, and he has his offspring with him!
|-
!Star
|Oh, hey, Buff Frog! You know him, too?
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|I have been watching 011358 since he was a tadpole. I implanted a tracker on his ear and have been keeping close tabs on him ever since.
|-
!
|''Buff Frog is shown to have a tracker on his right ear.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|[whistling, scratches just below his ear, continues whistling]
|-
!Star
|Okay, I don't know about this, Goodwell. The spying? The costumes? The monster musk? Monsters are just like us. You don't need all this equipment to get to know them.
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Get to know them? [laughs] Oh, sweet, naive Star. It's not so simple. When monsters and Mewmans mix, bad things happen, usually to the monsters.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, but the—
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|I've devised a plan! Let me show... you... [slowly slinks away into another room]
|-
!
|''Dr. Goodwell returns with a cart covered in a tarp. She pulls away the tarp to reveal a model of the monster village and surrounding valleys.''
|-
|Dr. Goodwill
|Ta-da!
|-
!Star
|Ooh! Nice cartsmanship.
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Thank you!
|-
!Star
|Aw, look at little tiny us in the treehouse! So cute! And the monster village! What are you planning?
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|[pours water from water cooler into a cup] You see that wondrously mysterious structure the monsters built? [pours water at top of model]
|-
!Star
|Uh, you mean "dam"?
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|I believe it's some kind of primitive monument that they built out of instinct. But no matter. We simply remove a small piece of their structure to release a gentle flow of water, which travels down the chasm, covers the lowlands around the monster nesting grounds, and creates a natural island! Voilà!
|-
!
|''Dr. Goodwell removes a piece of the dam in her model, causing the water to flow down and turn the village into an island.''
|-
!Star
|More like a prison. I mean, how are they supposed to get in and out?
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|[starts to look crazy] Well, they don't! It's guaranteed total isolation from Mewmans! [takes out detonator] Shall I detonate the dam?
|-
!Star
|Listen, we can't just go around blowing up dams and imprisoning monsters. That's crazy! Mewmans have been deciding what's best for monsters for way too long.
|-
!
|''As Star talks, something beeps.''
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|[with the detonator button pressed] But I already did it.
|-
!
|''An explosion at the dam causes water to rush down from the top.''
|-
!Star
|Ugh. Unbelievable. You know what, Jelly? You doomed these monsters!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|You don't like my explosion?
|-
!Star
|It's not about that. I thought you were different. But you're just like everybody else here. [leaves treehouse]
|-
!
|''Cut to Buff Frog and his tadpoles in the village.''
|-
![[Buff Frog]]
|No, no, no, no, no. Stop complaining. Look, of course there is bigger, better stroller. But you should appreciate the one we have.
|-
!
|''Buff Frog's tadpoles, crammed into the small stroller, look at him sad and angry.''
|-
!Star
|[runs up to Buff Frog, panting] Hey, Buff Frog! Look-look-look-look-look! [stuffs binoculars into Buff Frog's eyes] Jelly Goodwell blew the dam, and now the water's gonna come down and turn this whole place into an island!
|-
!Buff Frog
|[looks at dam] What?
|-
!
|''In Buff Frog's vision, a small amount of water trickles steadily from the dam.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Hey, Star, it's not a problem. That's just a little trickle of water. Nothing we haven't seen before. [to Dr. Goodwell] Oh, you must be crazy dirty lady that watches us through trees. Hello. I am Yvgeny Bulgolyubov.
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Well, I'm Jelly Goodwell! Oh-ho-ho!
|-
!
|''Dr. Goodwell shakes Buff Frog's hand with the hand she's holding the detonator with. Another explosion at the dam goes off, destroying it entirely and sending a large rush of water hurling toward the village.''
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Oh, I'm such a turd-brain! I... I shook your hand with the blower-upper thing!
|-
!Buff Frog
|No, it's too much water! It won't create an island. This will destroy entire village! Come on!
|-
!
|''The water rushes through the winding valley toward the village.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|[picks up boulder] Incoming! [hurls boulder]
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Oh, my goodness!
|-
!
|''Buff Frog hurls the boulder off-screen.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Come on, move it! This is not drill!
|-
!
|''More monsters appear to hurl objects. [[Three-eyed Potato Baby]] throws a house.'' 
|-
![[Three-eyed Potato Baby]]
|Hey, hey!
|-
!
|''Star uses her magic to stack the objects together to make a new dam.''
|-
!Star
|[grunting]
|-
!
|''The water continues to rush toward the village, knocking over some trees.''
|-
!Monster
|Hey, Star! [tosses boulder at Star]
|-
!Star
|[stacks boulder on top of dam]
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Incredible! Mewmans and monsters working together!
|-
!Star
|Here it comes!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Oh, no!
|-
!Katrina
|Hey!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Huh?
|-
!Katrina
|Grab that rock!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Oh! [picks up rock]
|-
!Katrina
|Great, let's go!
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Oh! Okay!
|-
!
|''Star finishes building the new dam seconds before the water reaches them. The water only makes a small splash over the dam.''
|-
!All
|[cheering]
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|How could I have been such a dum-dum? Here I thought we should live separately. But really, Mewmans should live like monsters!
|-
!
|''Dr. Goodwell rips off her clothes. Her hat lands on a small monster's head. Star covers Buff Frog and his tadpoles' eyes.''
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|Ha-ha! [rolls in mud] Play in the mud! Act like idiots! [laughs]
|-
!
|''Dr. Goodwell throws a rock at her hat on the small monster's head, knocking it off.''
|-
!Dr. Goodwell
|I'm a monster! [laughs] I'm a monster! [laughs, climbs tree]
|-
!
|''Star picks up Dr. Goodwell's "Royal Monster Expert" badge and pins it to Buff Frog's chest.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|[grunts]
|-
!Star
|There. Now Mewni has a real monster expert.
|-
!Buff Frog
|[tearing up, strained] Thank you.
|-
!Star
|Awww, you're crying.
|-
!Buff Frog
|[strained] No, the badge. I think you broke the skin a little.
|-
!Star
|Oh, gosh! [removes badge from Buff Frog's chest] Sorry, sorry, sorry!
|-
!Star and Buff Frog
|[laughing]
