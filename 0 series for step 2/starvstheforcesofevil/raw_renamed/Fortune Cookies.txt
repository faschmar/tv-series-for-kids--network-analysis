|''Episode begins at the [[Diaz Household]]. [[Star Butterfly|Star]] throws a punch at the camera, which cuts to [[Three-eyed Potato Baby]], [[Buff Frog]], and [[Beard Deer]] falling over. Camera shifts to Star and [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] side by side, dodging attacks and blasting spells. [[Ludo]] watches the battle from atop a nearby rock.''
|-
!Ludo
|How are you losing?! You guys have, like, 200 pounds on her!
|-
!
|''Camera shifts back to Star and Marco, blasting Beard Deer in his pants as he cries.''
|-
!Ludo
|[to [[Bearicorn]]] At least hit her with a rock or something!
|-
!
|''Bearicorn roars and throws a pebble at Star's head. She doesn't budge.''
|-
!Ludo
|[frustrated groan]
|-
!Star Butterfly
|Woo-hoo!
|-
!
|''After bouncing off a [[Unnamed two headed monster|two-headed monster]], Star jumps onto a cactus.''
|-
!Star
|Off the cactus, over the tree! Nothin' but net!
|-
!
|''Star fires a Dagger Crystal Heart Attack. It ricochets off a cactus and into the back of the [[unnamed giraffe monster|giraffe monster]]'s neck.''
|-
!Star
|Told you I could do it.
|-
!
|''Marco smiles and almost gives Star a dollar bill. He turns around to see several monsters approaching in a line.''
|-
!Marco Diaz
|Double or nothing! One kick, seven monsters!
|-
!
|''Star smiles and bows.''
|-
!Marco
|Hiii-yah!
|-
!
|''Marco kicks Buff Frog in the chin, knocking him backwards into the other monsters, and they fall like dominoes. At the back of the line, Three-eyed Potato Baby falls over onto Ludo.''
|-
!Ludo
|[screams]
|-
!Marco
|After a victory like this, there's only one thing to do: get Chinese food!
|-
!Star
|Ooh, Chinese food! [walks off-screen with Marco] I have no idea what that is.
|-
!
|''Camera pans over to Ludo, still underneath Three-eyed Potato Baby.''
|-
!Ludo
|[angry groans]
|-
!
|''Ludo's frustrated cries carry over into the next scene at his [[Castle Avarius|castle]]. Cut to the castle break room. Ludo and Bearicorn stand next to a vending machine while Ludo hollers in complete anger.''
|-
!Ludo
|[screaming] You guys are USELESS!!!!
|-
!
|''Camera pans across the break room. Three-eyed Potato Baby hovers over the water cooler, with the [[Boo Fly]] stuck inside. The two-headed monster's right head has forks in his eyes. The giraffe monster plays a guitar. The [[Unnamed nose-horn monster|warthog monster]] has a baguette in his nose. [[Big Chicken]] accidentally knocks over the coffeemaker. An orange lizard monster sits on top of the refrigerator. Cut back to Ludo and Bearicorn. Bearicorn tries inserting a dollar into the vending machine, but it keeps rejecting the dollar.''
|-
!Ludo
|You're always screwing up my brilliant plans! I need someone who can wrangle you imbeciles. [slaps Bearicorn's hand] Oh, go get change!
|-
!
|''Three-eyed Potato Baby gets water from the water cooler as the Boo Fly floats inside. Scene transitions to Chinese restaurant, where Star and Marco have lunch.''
|-
!Star
|[holding chopsticks] Delicious! And it's so fun eating with these tiny wands! [imitates laser]
|-
!
|''[[Mrs. Liao]] puts a plate of fortune cookies on Star and Marco's table.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, and there's cookies too!
|-
!
|''Star quickly eats a cookie and spits out the paper.''
|-
!Star
|Bleh. I don't like the filling.
|-
!Marco
|These are fortune cookies. They can magically predict the future.
|-
!Star
|What?! No way!
|-
!Marco
|[eats cookie] "A friend will greet you with a smile."
|-
!Star
|Aww, how sweet. [smiles]
|-
!Marco
|[gasps] See? The cookies know all.
|-
!Star
|No, it can't be. [breaks cookie] "Think positive and good luck will come your way."
|-
!
|''Mrs. Liao passes the table with a box of fortune cookies. Star jumps out of her seat and goes up to her.''
|-
!Star
|[yelping excitedly] More cookies!
|-
!Mrs. Liao
|They're stale.
|-
!Star
|Gimme!
|-
!Mrs. Liao
|[gives Star the cookies] You're a weird girl.
|-
!Marco
|Wow, Star. Good luck ''did'' come your way.
|-
!Star
|It did, it did! These are incredible!
|-
!
|''Star holds the cookies up to her face with a frozen smile.''
|-
!Marco
|...Star?
|-
!
|''Cut to a waiting room at Ludo's Castle. Job applicants waiting to be interviewed include a short monster with a lot of eyes, a horned bird, a cute pudgy jackalope, a snake in a bowtie, a large muscular monster, and a female cyclops applying lipstick. In an office, Ludo interviews a six-eyed, four-armed monster in a greasy shirt. His eye twitches. On his desk are a Star Butterfly-shaped pencil holder (making it look like Star is impaled with two pencils) and a Newton's cradle with skulls.''
|-
!Applicant 1
|Eh, previous job experience? Nope. No one's ever been dumb enough to hire me.
|-
!
|''Cut to next applicant: a monster with a long, thin neck and a large head.''
|-
!Applicant 2
|Weaknesses? I don't have any.
|-
!
|''His head falls over to the left. Cut to next applicant: a female pig-like monster with horns.''
|-
!Applicant 3
|How am I under pressure? Awesome!
|-
!Ludo
|''(o.s.)'' Hmm, is that so?
|-
!Applicant 3
|[trembling] Uh, yeah. Um, w-why? Did you hear otherwise? I can't take it anymore! [screaming, jumps out the window]
|-
!
|''Cut to next applicant: a fluffy monster with curly horns. Ludo's eye twitches even harder.''
|-
!Applicant 4
|Where do I see myself in ten years? Oh, we're best friends and we hang out all the time sharin' feelings and holdin' hands.
|-
!
|''Cut to next applicant: Three-eyed Potato Baby.''
|-
!Three-eyed Potato Baby
|[incomprehensible babbling]
|-
!Ludo
|You make absolutely no sense! Go away!
|-
!
|''Cut to next applicant: a squid-like monster petting a small animal.''
|-
!Applicant 5
|Soft... So soft...
|-
!Ludo
|''(o.s.)'' Next!
|-
!
|''Cut to next applicant: the pudgy jackalope from the waiting room.''
|-
!Ludo
|(''o.s.'') Next!
|-
!
|''Cut to next applicant: a small slime creature.''
|-
!Ludo
|(''o.s.'') Next!
|-
!
|''Cut to next applicant: a female monster who looks like Ludo. She has hearts in her eyes.''
|-
!Ludo
|(''o.s.'') ''Neeeeext!''
|-
!
|''Ludo rubs his temples as he gets a headache.''
|-
!Ludo
|These idiots are even dumber than ''you'' idiots!
|-
!
|''[[Toffee]] enters and gives Ludo a glass of swamp water with an eyeball in it.''
|-
!Toffee
|West Mewnian swamp water. Or do you drink from the bottle?
|-
!Ludo
|On days like this...
|-
!Toffee
|Tell me about it.
|-
!Ludo
|Oh, I'll tell you... [gurgling] I've been trying to steal a [[Star Butterfly's wand|wand]] from a teenager. It's harder than it ought to be. [tosses glass away] Wait a second!
|-
!
|''Ludo pulls on a lever next to him, raising the height of his seat.''
|-
!Ludo
|Where did you come from?
|-
!Toffee
|I let myself in.
|-
!Ludo
|When?
|-
!Toffee
|After you hired me.
|-
!Ludo
|I hired you?
|-
!Toffee
|I accept.
|-
!Ludo
|...Excellent!
|-
!
|''Bearicorn claps. Buff Frog looks confused. Toffee shakes Ludo's hand and leaves a black card.''
|-
!Toffee
|We'll start tomorrow. Get some rest. [leaves]
|-
!Ludo
|Uhhh... Did anybody catch his name?
|-
!
|''Ludo, Buff Frog, and Bearicorn look at the black card. It reads "TOFFEE."''
|-
!Ludo
|"Toffee". I guess his name is Toffee!
|-
!
|''Cut to Diaz Household – next day. Star holds up a box of fortune cookies.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, wise and powerful cookies, bestow your sugary prophecies upon me.
|-
!
|''Marco makes a plate of his [[Marco's Super Awesome Nachos|Super Awesome Nachos]].''
|-
!Marco
|Ehhh... Gotcha, Star! Those fortunes aren't magic. They're put there by people in a factory.
|-
!Star
|Next you'll tell me that's how they get the snow in snow globes. It's clear they're the work of dark wizards.
|-
!Marco
|I'm serious. They're not real. They're just vague so you can read things into them.
|-
!Star
|[breaks cookie] "An unexpected visitor will soon arrive."
|-
!
|''Star turns to the door expectantly. Marco walks over and opens and closes the door repeatedly.''
|-
!Marco
|See? No one's here. Now, who wants nachos?
|-
!
|''[[Ferguson]] suddenly appears behind the door.''
|-
!Ferguson
|Did someone say nachos?!
|-
!Star
|Well, hello, my ''unexpected visitor''.
|-
!Marco
|Ferguson, Star thinks fortune cookies are magical. Will you please tell her they're not?
|-
!Ferguson
|Now, whoa, man. Whoa. Cookies are magical. Once, I ate one from the floor of a cab, and I met my spirit animal that night. It was a wolf. [walks off-screen]
|-
!Star
|Why are you suddenly a non-believer? [breaks cookie] "Reach for the stars and achieve your dream."
|-
!
|''Star blasts a hole in the ceiling and nearly hits Buff Frog.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''Marco pushes Star out of the way of falling debris.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Huh?
|-
!Star
|Pegasus feathers! I have always dreamed of having a skylight in here!
|-
!Marco
|[groaning]
|-
!Star
|Blindly following these fortune cookies is the best decision I've ever made.
|-
!Marco
|[straining] Can you give me a hand?
|-
!Star
|[breaks cookie] ...Yes.
|-
!
|''Cut to Ludo's Castle – break room.''
|-
!Ludo
|Okay, Toffee, I'm going to show you what we're working with here.
|-
!
|''The two-headed monster and [[Unnamed frill-neck monster|frill-neck monster]] are having a breakdance battle.''
|-
!Music
|''[rapping]''<br />''This is my house, this is my house, this is my...<br />My house, this is my house, this is my...<br />This is my house, this is my house, this is my...''
|-
!
|''The fly monster sticks a "KICK ME" sign to the frill-neck monster's back. The lizard monster kicks him into Bearicorn, and Bearicorn shoves him into Beard Deer. All of the monsters begin roughhousing.''
|-
!Ludo
|Guess I'm doomed, huh? Be honest. I can handle it.
|-
!
|''Buff Frog appears through a dimensional portal and salutes.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Ludo, master. The girl things the messages in her cookies are fortunes. She does whatever they say.
|-
!Ludo
|[to Buff Frog] Interrupting! [to Toffee] Well, Toffee? Give it to me straight. Are my monsters the worst ever or what?
|-
!Toffee
|Uh...
|-
!
|''The warthog monster punches the lizard monster over and over, eventually getting his fist stuck in the lizard's mouth.''
|-
!Warthog monster
|Aw, man. It's stuck.
|-
!Lizard monster
|[muffled]
|-
!Toffee
|Maybe... we can do something with those... fortune cookies.
|-
!
|''Buff Frog pushes Ludo off to the side.''
|-
!Ludo
|What? What is... What? What?
|-
!Buff Frog
|[whispering] You sure you trust him, boss?
|-
!Ludo
|Of course!
|-
!
|''Ludo walks off with Toffee. The two-headed monster briefly walks on-screen with Three-eyed Potato Baby chewing on his left head. Cut back to Star and Marco walking through [[Echo Creek]].''
|-
!Star
|Aw. Last cookie. I can't wait to get more!
|-
!Marco
|Star, I'm telling you, they'll back me up at the restaurant. Food can't predict the future!
|-
!Star
|Sure it can. On [[Mewni]], there's a place where you can get calzones that'll tell you how you're going to die.
|-
!
|''Cut to shot of Mewni. A [[Butterfly family]] manservant bites into a calzone.''
|-
!Calzone
|You will die from choking on a calzone. Just kidding. [laughing] A giant's gonna sit on your face.
|-
!
|''Cut back to Echo Creek. Star and Marco enter an alleyway behind the Chinese restaurant. The two-headed and frill-neck monsters are in disguise and breakdancing.''
|-
!Star
|What are they doing?
|-
!Marco
|Shhh. I think one of them's about to get served.
|-
!
|''The fly monster sneaks up on Star and replaces her fortune cookie with another. He flies back to Toffee, who pets him on the head.''
|-
!Toffee
|Well done.
|-
!
|''As Star opens the cookie, Ludo's army appears, and the two-headed and frill-neck monsters remove their disguises. Bearicorn appears from under the boombox.''
|-
!Bearicorn
|Fooled you! [laughing]
|-
!Marco
|Hiiii-yah—
|-
!Star
|''[holds Marco back]'' Hold on. "Love is always the answer." Hmm.
|-
!
|''Toffee narrows his eyes. The monsters surround Star and Marco.''
|-
!Marco
|What?! Not in this case! Fighting is!
|-
!Star
|Sorry, Marco. It's not the will of the cookie.
|-
!
|''Big Chicken attacks Marco.''
|-
!Marco
|Really?! Now?! Whoa!
|-
!
|''Ludo's monsters chase Marco.''
|-
!Star
|Hugs! [hugs Beard Deer]
|-
!
|''Beard Deer briefly looks confused before hugging Star back.''
|-
!Ludo
|There's the wand! I can totally grab it!
|-
!Toffee
|[holds Ludo back] Patience.
|-
!Ludo
|Awww...
|-
!Marco
|Hiii-yah!
|-
!
|''Marco kicks Big Chicken. A large egg lands in his hands. He throws it in Buff Frog's face. Bearicorn shoves Marco into Three-eyed Potato Baby and Beard Deer. Marco steps on Three-eyed Potato Baby's foot and knocks him away, then tosses Beard Deer off-screen. When the two-headed monster approaches from behind, Marco does a jumping split kick to its two heads.''
|-
!Marco
|Star! [karate chops giraffe monster] Forget that stupid fortune! Help me!
|-
!Star
|[hugging warthog monster] Marco, don't fight. Then they'll stop fighting you. Trust the cookie!
|-
!
|''Ludo's monsters toss Marco into a dumpster. Bearicorn uses his horn to lock it shut.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey, let me out! Hey! Hey!
|-
!
|''Ludo's monsters approach Star.''
|-
!Star
|You guys really need some hugs.
|-
!Ludo
|It's actually working! [touches Toffee's sleeve] Mmmm...!
|-
!Star
|[hugging two-headed monster] Love is always the answer.
|-
!
|''Ludo shoves his way past the monsters''
|-
!Ludo
|Out of my way! [squealing excitedly] Mine! Mine! Yes! Yes! Yes—!
|-
!
|''Before Ludo grabs the wand, the two-headed monster holds him back.''
|-
!Two-headed monster<br />(right head)
|Back off, dude. I've been waiting for this since middle school. ''[continues hugging Star]''
|-
!Ludo
|What?! You idiots are screwing the plan!
|-
!Star
|Plan?
|-
!Two-headed monster<br />(right head)
|Huh? [inhale, exhale] Okay, look, Star. This is really hard to say, but if this is gonna go any further, I want our relationship to have a foundation of honesty.
|-
!Two-headed monster<br />(left head)
|Me too.
|-
!Star
|So confused.
|-
!Two-headed monster<br />(right head)
|Fortune cookies aren't real. It was all a trap so Ludo could steal your wand.
|-
!Ludo
|[stunned squealing]
|-
!Two-headed monster<br />(right head)
|Anyway, I hope—
|-
!Two-headed monster<br />(left head)
|''We'' hope.
|-
!Two-headed monster<br />(right head)
|''[groans]'' ''We'' hope this isn't a deal breaker.
|-
!
|''The dumpster flies into Ludo and the two-headed monster. Marco opens the lid.''
|-
!Marco
|You know what this means, don't you, Star?
|-
!Star
|Oh, yeah. Love is never the answer.
|-
!Marco
|Aw, man. I wanted to say it. [closes dumpster lid]
|-
!Star
|Mega Mushroom Destruction Blast!
|-
!Ludo's army
|[whimpering]
|-
!
|''Star blasts the monsters with a mushroom blast. Toffee watches from a roof, raising an eyebrow and grinning slightly. When the mushroom cloud fades, the monsters lie on the ground covered in mushrooms.''
|-
!Ludo's army
|[groaning]
|-
!
|''Ludo pushes Bearicorn through a dimensional portal.''
|-
!Ludo
|''[to Toffee] Welcome to my life.''
|-
!
|''Ludo enters the portal. Before following, Toffee briefly looks back at Star.''
|-
!Marco
|[groaning]
|-
!Star
|Sorry. I should've listened to you. Obviously you know better than a dessert.
|-
!Marco
|No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have messed with you and said those fortunes were magical in the first place.
|-
!
|''The back door of the Chinese restaurant opens, and Mrs. Liao appears with another box of cookies.''
|-
!Mrs. Liao
|Oh! Weird perky girl! You want some more stale cookies?
|-
!Star
|Who could say no to that?
|-
!
|''Star takes the box of cookies and Mrs. Liao closes the door while Marco looks at Star.''
|-
!Star
|[laughing] What? They're not real fortunes, but they're still real cookies.
|-
!
|''Marco breaks and eats the cookie, and Star reads the fortune.''
|-
!Star
|"A great evil has been unleashed."
|-
!Star and Marco
|Ooooohhh... [laughing]
|-
!
|''Star throws the fortune away. Cut to Ludo's Castle. Ludo and Toffee toast with some Mewnian swamp water.''
|-
!Ludo
|Cheers. [slurps] That was the closest we've ever come, but that girl always gets the best of me.
|-
!
|''Toffee approaches the window and looks at [[Butterfly Castle]].''
|-
!Toffee
|Yes, well, you're not the first monster to fall victim to their magic.
|-
!Ludo
|Things will be different when I get the wand. [laughing, imitating laser]
|-
!
|''Toffee looks out the window expressionless.''
