|''Episode begins inside [[Star Butterfly]]'s wand; a star-shaped pad in the middle of a lounge-like room intermittently flashes with light. [[Spider With a Top Hat (character)|Spider With a Top Hat]] drops down from above with his web. Several of Star's summoning creatures suddenly pop into the room through the star pad, groaning as they enter.''

!Spider
|Yeah, you're all my number ones! Ha-ha!
|-
!All
|[cheering]
|-
!Narwhal
|You're number one, Spider!
|-
!Spider
|I don't know why you guys are acting all sore, because the battle ''I'' saw was like, "Oh, I'm Mr. Bad Guy! I'm gonna eat up the childrens!" And then the warnicorns came in and were all, like, [roaring] And the bad guy was, like, [whimpering] "I didn't mean any harm!"
|-
!Rock
|He's totally right!
|-
!Spider
|"No, no!" [choking]
|-
!All

!Beanbag

|-
!Narwhal
|Hey, Spider, we all really appreciate you. Everything we do is the most important life-or-death situation all the time, you know, and it's nice to be greeted with something frivolous, something light. See you in the morning, bud.
|-
!Spider
|Hey, Narwhal. For real, how do you do that Narwhal Blast?
|-
!Narwhal
|It's easy. You hear the call, and your warrior spell instincts kick in. It's like... Narwhal Blast! [flies into a pillar] But hey, I like the way you do it.
|-
!Spider
|Good night.
|-
!

|Hey, Rock, can I work out a few sets with you?
|-
!Rock
|Hey, it's Spider! So you wanna work out with the big dogs? Wanna start with the one-ounce or the two-ounce?
|-
!Spider
|Actually, I want a big weight like you guys.
|-
!Rock
|Oh. Huh. Yeah, well, you should probably leave the big weights to us, Spider-dog.
|-
!Spider
|But I can do it.
|-
!Rock
|Uh... Well, he does have the headband. Okay.
|-

|-
!Spider
|Narwhal, I got something to show you.

|-
!Spider
|[removes paintings from Narwhal's wall, sighs] Spider with a Top Hat Blast! [hurls himself at target] Ugh!
|-
!Narwhal
|[laughing] Dude, that's hilarious! [raucous laughter]
|-
!Spider
|No. I'm being serious.
|-
!Narwhal
|Oh, I thought you were kidding. [puts paintings back on wall] Look, singing and dancing is great, but fighting? You could get hurt. Or worse, you could get Star killed.
|-

|[tearing up] ...Good night. [cries and runs away]
|-
!Narwhal
|Hey, Spider! Come on!

|-
!Narwhal
|What happened to Spider? He didn't wake us up.
|-
!
|''The spells gather around Spider, who is sulking on top of the star pad. He slinks to the floor. Makeup Blast picks him up and brings him over to the couch.''
|-
!Makeup Blast
|Uh, Spider, you okay? You're acting funny.
|-
!Spider
|[looks annoyed]
|-
!Makeup Blast
|Not like funny-funny. Like something's wrong-funny. Everyone's really worried about you, especially me.
|-
!Female Narwhal
|Yeah, we missed your morning dance number with the bubbles.
|-
!Rock
|Yeah, and the lights.
|-
!Spider
|''What''? Did I fail to entertain you?!
|-
!Female Narwhal
|Um, yes, you did.
|-
!Spider
|Well, I'm ''sorry'' if I don't feel like being your little dancing clown today!

The monster slinks back into the shadows, and Spider's laser cannon stops shooting. The monster disappears. Spider's minigun turns back into a top hat. In a blinding flash of light, the house returns to normal. Marco sits in the fireplace with bruises and rips in his clothes.''
