|''Scene opens at the [[Sanctuary]] at night. The vending machine inside is empty and beeping because it is out of order. Black ooze seeps on the floor where Moon and Star Butterfly are sleeping.''
|-
![[Moon Butterfly]]
|[groggily] Huh? [getting up] What is going on? Star, wake up.
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|[awakening] Marco, we're late for school!
|-
!Moon
|I'm not Marco.
|-
!Star
|Where am I?!
|-
!
|''The black ooze starts gushing in from multiple places.''
|-
!Star
|Oh. Oh, no! The High Commission!
|-
!Moon
|Leave them! [grabbing Star] There's no time!
|-
!
|''The two head to the door, but when Moon pushes the button, it leaks ooze and the door remains locked.''
|-
!Moon
|There's no way out!
|-
!Star
|[grabs wand]
|-
!Moon
|What are you doing?
|-
!Star
|Escape Route Blast!
|-
!
|''Her wand emits a powerful green burst which knocks a huge hole in the side of the Sanctuary. Star and Moon wash up on the shore as the Sanctuary sinks back into the depths of the water.''
|-
!Star
|Magic is not supposed to do that.
|-
!Moon
|I'm not sure what that was. [attempts to cast a spell] But my magic's gone.
|-
!Star
|Rats.
|-
!Moon
|It will be okay.
|-
!Star
|No, [pointing] rats. We gotta hide.
|-
!
|''Star grabs her mother and pulls her behind a log while three rats sail by on a wooden raft.''
|-
!Star
|[grabbing wand] Narwhal–!
|-
!Moon
|Star, no. [grabs wand]
|-
!Star
|Mom, you can't take my wand.
|-
!Moon
|It was mine first! No more magic until we find a way to stop this.
|-
!Star
|I've got an idea. Let's go destroy Toffee. [laughs] Come on Mom, let's just go. Let's go kill him!
|-
!Moon
|Star, no.
|-
!Star
|Well, then what's the plan Mom? 'Cause I ain't seein' one.
|-
!Moon
|[sighs] Oh Star. [exasperated] I don't have a plan. I'm just trying to keep you safe, okay?
|-
!Star
|Okay. Well, can't stay out here.
|-
!
|''A snake hisses behind the log and attempts to bite Star. She promptly punches its mouth closed.''
|-
!Star
|It's creepy.
|-
!Moon
|We need another hiding place.
|-
!Frog
|Ribbit. [pause] Ribbit.
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Ribbit. I think I have an idea where we can go. But you have to trust me.
|-
!
|''The scene changes. Star is knocking on the door to [[Buff Frog]]'s house. Buff Frog opens it, wearing his evening robe and underwear.''
|-
!Moon
|[gasps]
|-
!Star
|Buff Frog!
|-
!Buff Frog
|Star Butterfly! [hugging her] Oh, my little sweet potato. It's been too long.
|-
!Moon
|Ahem.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oh, [pulling his robe closed] Queen Moon. [bows] Greetings.
|-
!Star
|Mom, this is Yvgeny Bulgolyubov.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Ah, no, no. Please call me Buff Frog.
|-
!Star
|He used to work for Ludo, but he's cool now.
|-
!Moon
|What?!
|-
!Star
|Hey, Buff Frog, can we crash with you for a night?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Of course. I owe you for all that tadpole-sitting.
|-
!Moon
|Star, can I speak with you? [walking out of range of Buff Frog] We cannot stay with him. He's a monster.
|-
!Star
|Mom, get with the times. Not all monsters are bad. [looks at Buff Frog]
|-
!Buff Frog
|[smiles]
|-
!
|''Out in the forest, a twig snaps.''
|-
!Moon
|What was that?
|-
!
|''Many sinister eyes in the forest peer at them.''
|-
!Moon
|Well, it seems we have no other choice.
|-
!
|''They begin to enter Buff Frog's house.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Uh, welcome to my...
|-
!Moon
|[walks inside, ignoring Buff Frog invitation]
|-
!Buff Frog
|...home.
|-
!Star
|[poking Buff Frog] Boop.
|-
!
|''Inside, Star and Moon find themselves in a puddle of mud.''
|-
!Moon
|[gasps]
|-
!Buff Frog
|You're in luck. It's rainy season. [picks up mud, applying it to his head] Ah, so good for the skin. Oh, uh, no shoes in house.
|-
!Star
|[smiles]
|-
!Moon
|[scowls]
|-
!Buff Frog
|I am, how you say, germaphobe.
|-
!Star
|[throwing off her boots] Ah. I feel so free.
|-
!
|''Star walks across the mud, and then willingly falls face-first into it.''
|-
!Star
|[surfacing] Buff Frog, wonderful home.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oh, thank you. Is a bit of a mess right now. Please take a seat.
|-
!
|''He point to his couch which has green slugs on it.''
|-
!Moon
|Oh! Are those... slugs?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Slugs keep furniture clean. I-I thought everyone knew that.
|-
!Moon
|I'll stand.
|-
!Star
|[in street voice] Yo, Buff Frog, where them [[Buff Frog's tadpoles|babies]] at?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oh, I just put them down for nap.
|-
!
|''His babies come leaping out behind the couch.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Ahh!
|-
!Star
|Babies!
|-
!
|''Buff Frog's babies leap on Star, pushing her into the mud.''
|-
!Star
|[laughing] Oh, I missed your little baby faces so much!
|-
!
|''The babies all reach out with their arms to hug Star.''
|-
!Star
|[screaming with excitement] Oh, my gosh, you have little baby arms!
|-
!Buff Frog
|Ah, yes. All except little Katrina. She is late bloomer.
|-
!Star
|[picking up Katrina] Oh, you little special snowflake.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Babies, say hello to Queen Butterfly.
|-
!Moon
|That really isn't–
|-
!
|''All the babies jump on Moon, knocking her into the mud.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Star, I have been so worried about you.
|-
!Star
|Why? I'm good.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Well, when Ludo took your castle, I thought, you know...
|-
!
|''Buff Frog makes a slicing sound while gesturing across his neck.''
|-
!Star
|Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Toffee has our castle?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Toffee is dead. Ludo in castle.
|-
!Star
|Ugh! Toffee not dead. Toffee inside Ludo.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oh. That is... so creepy.
|-
!Star
|[gasping] Papa! Dad's still in the castle! We have to go save him.
|-
!Moon
|...No.
|-
!Star
|[gasps, slowly] He is your husband!
|-
!Moon
|Star, I've made my decision. We stay here. [to Buff Frog] Excuse me. Where is your washroom?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Uh, washroom?
|-
!Moon
|Yes. I'd like to freshen up a bit.
|-
!Star
|She needs to make boom-boom.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oh! [laughs] The washroom is out back.
|-
!Moon
|[blushing] Thank you.
|-
!Star
|I'm sorry. My mom's got... monster issues.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Yes, I'm getting certain... vibe from her.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, we all are. But, Buff Frog, I came here for a favor.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Of course. Anything for you.
|-
!Star
|I need you to hang out with my mom. I need you to keep her busy while I go find Toffee.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Star, Toffee is very dangerous. Do you have plan?
|-
!Star
|I have plan.
|-
!Buff Frog
|[pointing a finger at her] You have plan?
|-
!Star
|[pointing back] I have plan.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Okay. When Moon returns, I will distract her.
|-
!Moon
|Distract me from what?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Uh, from this.
|-
!
|''Buff Frog lifts up part of his chest, revealing a Ludo tattoo with the word "Forever" written below it. Star looks shocked.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|I didn't want you to see it. Bad choices in past.
|-
!Moon
|Oh. Thank you. So what do you monsters do for entertainment?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Uh, we could smash bugs.
|-
!
|''Star elbows Buff Frog.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|We could play board game.
|-
!Star
|Great idea, Buff Frog. And I will hang out with the babies in their room.
|-
!
|''Star runs to the babies' room and shuts the door.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Your daughter is... very strange.
|-
!Moon
|[pause] Thank you.
|-
!Buff Frog
|We have many option of board game. "Hungry Hungry Mewmans!", "Mewman Slayer", "Monstropoly", "Mewman Trap", "Monster Conquerors", "Castle Crushers", "Kill the Queen", "Mewman vs. Monster"... Oh! My favorite – "Puddle Defender".
|-
!Moon
|Hmm, interesting.
|-
!Buff Frogg
|[pulling out game tokens] I like babushka monster.
|-
!Moon
|[picks up angry princess figure] I don't know why, but I'm drawn to this one.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Okay, the rules of Puddle Defender are...
|-
!
|''Buff Frog sees Star beginning to make her stealthy escape.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Uh...
|-
!
|''Star gives him a thumbs up.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Um... the rules are...
|-
!Moon
|[frustrated] Yes?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Uh, rules are simple. The evil bloodthirsty Mewman – that's you – must try and sneak past watchful monster parent – that's me – break into daycare, explode helpless monster babies, and turn them into stew for eating.
|-
!Moon
|[gasps] That is horrible!
|-
!
|''Star snaps off a piece of cane/bamboo, which her mother hears.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Hey, here is dice! You roll first.
|-
!Moon
|[rolling] Seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. [sighs, draws a card] "You are filthy Mewman. Use teeth-sharpening spell for better eating of monster baby."
|-
!
|''Meanwhile, Star swims across the mud puddle under its surface using her cane/bamboo to breathe.''
|-
!Moon
|Really?
|-
!Buff Frog
|Is this fun? Heh. [rolling dice] Who will get to daycare first? [rolls five] Suspense is killing me. [drawing a card] "Congratulations." Oh. "You set a Mewman camp on fire. Collect four corn pieces from bank."
|-
!Moon
|[rolling] Hmm. Come on. [moves her piece]
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oh, you land in mud puddle. You get nothing. [rolling] Tough break.
|-
!Moon
|Hm. This game seems a tad biased.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Really? I never noticed. [moving piece] Yay! I get more corn!
|-
!
|''Star breaks the surface of the mud, coughs, and covers her mouth. Moon turns around.''
|-
!Moon
|Did you hear something?
|-
!
|''Star has managed to avoid her gaze by dangling from the ceiling via a vine.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|[sweating] I hear nothing.
|-
!Moon
|You know, [rolling] it's monsters that eat Mewman babies.
|-
!Buff Frog
|Oh, really? [rolling] Can you name a time when a monster has ever done such a thing?
|-
!Moon
|Well, no, but [rolling] when I was a child, we played a game called "Castle Defender" about Mewmans protecting our babies from ravenous monsters.
|-
!
|''She moves her piece forward and knocks a frog game token.''
|-
!Moon
|That idea had to come from somewhere.
|-
!Buff Frog
|[rolling, smirking] Because it was in a children's board game?
|-
!Moon
|[rolling] I just think that monsters would have less of a reputation if they didn't act so bloodthirsty all the time.
|-
!Buff Frog
|[rolling, angrily] Monsters only act that way to protect their babies from Mewmans. ''You'' may not understand, but monsters will do anything for our children.
|-
!Moon
|Don't talk to me about what I'm willing to do! Why do you think I'm here in this swamp? To protect Star from Toffee! Don't you think I'm worried to death about my husband? But I have to keep my child safe at all costs! Something ''you'' probably wouldn't understand, [now yelling] because you're a monster!
|-
!Buff Frog
|[throws game board, yelling] You insult me, Queen Moon! My buffbabies, they are my life. And that is why... Star Butterfly!
|-
!
|''Buff Frog whips around, pointing at Star who's know right at the doorway. She freezes.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|I will not help you escape!
|-
!Moon
|Star!
|-
!Star
|Buff Frog!
|-
!Buff Frog
|Star will be safe here.
|-
!
|''Buff Frog pulls a handle from the ceiling, which springs all kinds of traps into place around his house, effectively locking it down.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Keeps babies in and dangers out.
|-
!Moon
|I should have realized. But of course. You're a parent too.
|-
!Star
|I can't believe you're taking her side!
|-
!Buff Frog and Moon
|[yelling, pointing] Go to your room!
|-
!
|''Star angrily stomps to the other side back to the babies' room.''
|-
!Buff Frog
|Kids.
|-
!
|''Cut to Star and the tadpoles in the other room.''
|-
!Star
|[pacing around and around, muttering] Scared ol' mama. Two-timing Buff Frog. What's their plan, huh? Just avoid your problems to death? Great plan. It's a terrible plan. I've got plans. I've got big plans. But no, they stuck me in here.
|-
!
|''Star punches a mud wall; her fist gets stuck in it.''
|-
!Katrina
|We can help you.
|-
!Star
|Not now, I'm thinking. Who said that?
|-
!Katrina
|It was me, Katrina.
|-
!Star
|[gasps] You guys can talk?!
|-
!Katrina
|Just me so far. I haven't told my dad yet. There's something else I haven't told him.
|-
!
|''All the buffbabies move a toy chest, revealing a hole in the ground.''
|-
!Star
|[gasps] Holy moley!
|-
!Katrina
|Sometimes you just gotta sneak out to the club and go dancing.
|-
!Star
|I feel ya, girl.
|-
!
|''Scene changes to the other end of the tunnel.''
|-
!Star
|All clear.
|-
!
|''The babies and Star jump out of the hole.''
|-
!Star
|Wow. We made it.
|-
!Katrina
|So, what's the big plan?
|-
!Star
|What plan?
|-
!Katrina
|The plan for beating Toffee?
|-
!Star
|[laughs] Oh, right. I don't have one.
|-
!Katrina
|Wha...?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, planning's not really my thing. I kinda just go for it.
|-
!Katrina
|That is a terrible plan!
|-
!Star
|Oh, my precious little ribbit babies. Don't you worry.
|-
!Katrina
|I'm very worried.
|-
!Star
|I'll see you after I destroy Toffee.
|-
!
|''Dramatic music plays as Star walks toward the castle.''
|-
!Katrina
|Hmm. She's gonna die.
