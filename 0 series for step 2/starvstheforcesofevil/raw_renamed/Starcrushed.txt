|Hey, Marco. Whatcha doin'?
|-
!Marco Diaz
|Jackie, can I ask you something? Why are all these people acting like everything's normal?
|-
!Jackie
|'Cause everything's normal. [eats one of Marco's nachos] Mm, you should try those. They're delicious.
|-
!Marco
|You know what? You can have it. [gives Jackie plate of nachos] I can't eat. My guts... ugh... are all... blah. You know what I mean?
|-
!Jackie
|Is this all 'cause you're embarrassed of your parents?
|-
!
|''[[Rafael Diaz|Rafael]] and [[Angie Diaz]] dance to hip-hop music.''
|-
!Rafael Diaz
|Oh! Oh! Oh!
|-
!Marco
|That's certainly not helping, but... no. Ugh! Everything's just all super weird with Star. I just want things to be normal.
|-
!Jackie
|You're having a Marco moment.
|-
!Marco
|Uh, yeah, I'm having a Marco moment. Ha,Yeah.

|What's up, Star? You having fun?
|-
!Star
|Oh, yeah. Totally. Hmm.
|-

|I just realized, I have to go to the bathroom.

|''Scene cuts to [[Ludo]]'s monster temple. The [[Mewni]]an tavern rats cheer for a rat eating dozens of cornstalks. [[Rhombulus]] bursts in and starts freezing rats in crystal. [[Queen Butterfly]] enters, followed by [[Lekmet]], [[Hekapoo]], and [[Omnitraxus Prime]]. Omnitraxus turns into a giant fist and punches through Ludo's chamber doors. Inside, the [[bald eagle]] is seen regurgitating bugs and grubs into the [[giant spider]]'s mouth.''
|-
!Moon and Hekapoo
|Eww!
|-
!
|''The eagle and spider charge at the group, and Hekapoo opens a [[dimensional portal]] for them to slip through. They end up on [[Earth]] outside Britta's Tacos.''

!
|''Scene cuts to Star's bedroom.''
|-
!Star
|[groans] So now, Marco and I can barely make eye contact because of [[Ruberiot]]'s dumb song. I mean, Marco actually thinks I have a crush on him. [hysterical laughter]
|-
!Pony Head
|Yeah, but, like... don't you, though?
|-
!Star
|What?! No! [stammering] Okay, maybe once.
|-
!StarFan13
|[gasps]
|-
!Star
|But I don't anymore.
|-
!StarFan13
|Aww.
|-
!Star
|I just think he's kinda cute. I think lots of things are cute. Puppies are cute, kitties are cute, tiny peppers are cuteâ€”
|-
!Janna
|Star, it's cool. We believe you.
|-
!Star
|[whines] I just want things to go back to normal. What if they never do, Kelly? What if they never do?
|-
!Kelly
|Girl, don't freak out. Maybe you two just need some space. Like me and Tad, we're on our third break this week.
|-
!Janna
|Come on, Star. Let's ditch this place and go to the party the bad kids are having. I heard it's super dangerous.
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh! Star, you know what? You love danger.
|-
!Star
|That is true.
|-
!Pony Head
|Boom! You're in! Let's go! [grabs Star by the collar and carries her out]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to Ludo's temple.''
|-
!Moon
|What do you mean he's gone? What did you do with him?
|-
!Ludo
|I didn't do anything. Glossaryck showed me something in the [[Magic Instruction Book|spell book]], and next thing I know, I wake up, and they're gone.
|-
!Moon
|Oh, come on. You stole the book.
|-
!Ludo
|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Glossaryck said the book is mine now. How's that stealing? And I think we can all agree Glossaryck comes and goes as he pleases.
|-
!Rhombulus
|That's true.
|-
!Hekapoo
|Yeah.
|-
!Moon
|And I suppose it's just a coincidence that you've taken up shelter here in this ancient monster temple.
|-
!Ludo
|I'm supposed to know that? This place was empty, so I moved in. It's cold out there! I'm wearing a chip bag, for corn's sake!
|-
!Moon
|What about your wand? You have half my family's crystal embedded in it.
|-
!Ludo
|It doesn't even work anymore. If it's yours, you can have it. Face it. You've got nothing on me.
|-
!Rhombulus
|All right, all right, all right, this is getting us nowhere. Time for Plan B.
|-
!Moon
|No. Wait.
|-
!Hekapoo
|No, we need to find Glossaryck.
|-
!
|''The Magic High Commission members leave the room. Moon starts to follow, but she stops and looks back at Ludo.''
|-
!Moon
|Oh, I... I saw your family, Ludo.
|-
!Ludo
|My family? Let me tell you about my family.

!Star, Pony Head, Janna, Kelly, and StarFan13
|Wow!

!Aaron Dominic
|[holding failed math quiz] "See me after class"? See ''this'' after class, Mr. Kimball! [throws quiz into trash can fire]
|-
!Pony Head
|Ooh, burning homework! So dangerous!
|-
!Star
|Is that legal?
|-
!Firefighter Woman
|[puts fire out] Don't worry. It's a controlled burn.
|-
!Kelly
|This is pretty cool, right? Janna's having a good time.
|-
!Janna
|[throws books into fire] Burn! Burn!
|-
!Star
|Yeah...
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, come on, B-Fly, you need to loosen up. Here. Throw this math quiz into the fire.
|-
!Star
|[throws math quiz into trash can fire] Yeah, I don't feel anything. You guys were so awesome to bring me here, but I just don't think I'm in a party mood right now.
|-
!Pony Head
|No, I'm not like that.
|-
!Star
|You guys stay and have fun with your controlled burn. I'll see you back at my place.

![[Oskar Greason]]
|(''o.s.'') Star?
|-
!Star
|Huh?

!
|''Oskar Greason, with his hair shortened, sits on a car hood with his keytar.''

!Oskar
|[walks up to Star] Is that you?
|-
!Star
|Um... yeah. Maybe. Do I know you?
|-
!Oskar
|It's me, Oskar. I got a haircut. Check it out. Mmm!
|-
!Star
|[surprised] Oskar?
|-
!Oskar
|You're not leaving already, are you?
|-
!Star
|Uh... [looks at her friends]

!Pony Head, Kelly and StarFan13
|[Pony Head] Oh, yeah.<br />[Kelly] He's cute.<br />[StarFan13] Go for it.

|''Scene cuts back to Diaz Household; Marco stands alone in the backyard.''
|-
!Jackie
|Hey. What are we staring at?
|-
!Marco
|Oh, nothing. Just thinking about, uh, stuff.
|-
!Jackie
|Marco, it's the end of the year. We don't have to think about anything!
|-
!Marco and Jackie
|[laughing]
|-
!Jackie
|Let's only think about you, me, and what we're gonna do this summer. Now, what am I thinking right now?
|-
!Marco
|Uh...
|-
!Jackie
|Come on, Marco. Read my mind.
|-
!Marco
|Mm-hmm.
|-
!Jackie
|Imagine all the time we'll save if we learn to read each other's minds.
|-
!Marco
|Mmm... You want me to kiss ya?
|-
!Jackie
|Um, no. I just wanted you to feed me pizza nuggets, but hey, good first shot. [kisses Marco's cheek] Now go get us some pizza nuggets.
|-
!
|''In the kitchen, [[Rafael Diaz|Rafael]] takes a tray of pizza nuggets out of the oven.''
|-
!Rafael Diaz
|Hello. Welcome to the world. Oh, Marco. How are you?
|-
!Marco
|Feelin' pretty great, Dad.
|-
!Rafael
|Oh, that's good. Hey, where's your partner in crime?
|-
!Marco
|Oh, Jackie? I guess we are pretty good partners.
|-
!Rafael
|Star, Marco. I was talking about Star.
|-
!Marco
|Oh.
|-
!Rafael
|Jackie is no criminal. Star, however? Now ''she's'' a criminal. I haven't heard any explosions or magic sounds. Is she okay?
|-
!Marco
|Well, uh... things are a bit weird between us right now.
|-
!Rafael
|What could be weird? Two teenagers sharing a home. One boy, one girl. ...Oh. Oh, no. Well, if things are weird, it's always good to talk it out. I feel great talking right now, and I don't even have a problem.
|-
!Marco
|Thanks, Dad.
|-
!Rafael
|Now, go. Get out.
|-
!Marco
|What?
|-
!Rafael
|I have to make more pizza nuggets.
|-
!Marco
|Oh.
|-
!Rafael
|Leave!

|''Scene cuts back to Ludo's temple.''
|-
!Ludo
|Oh, and then, and then, and then, when I was, like, five years old, my big brother Chudo was walking me home from the park, and we stopped at this old, burned-down castle, and he said, "Well! [claps] Looks like the house burned down. Guess we've got to live outside now."
|-
!Moon
|That must've been difficult. But I do know that [[Dennis]] misses you. He says hello.
|-
!Ludo
|How is he?
|-
!Moon
|He's worried about his big brother. And so am I.
|-
!Ludo
|Worried about me? Don't you get it? I lost my [[Ludo's army|army]], my [[Castle Avarius|kingdom]], my clothes! And look â€“ still standing!
|-
!Moon
|Yes, but for how much longer? You don't look well, Ludo. Tell me what's going on, and maybe I can help you.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to black, then back to the Stop & Slurp.''
|-
!Star
|So I haven't seen you at school in a while.
|-
!Oskar
|Yeah, I... dropped out to pursue my music.
|-
!Star
|Oh, you just gonna play.. that right now?
|-
!
|''Oskar plays some synthesized rock music on his keytar. He then spins his keytar around his neck until the strap snaps and sends the keytar flying into the sky.''
|-
!Oskar
|You think maybe.. it'll end up on Mars?
|-
!Star
|Oh, I don't know. I mean, heh, Mars is pretty far away.
|-
!Oskar
|What are you saying?
|-
!Star
|Oh, no, no. I mean, yeah! Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Maybe it'll end up on Mars.
|-
!Oskar
|You see, Star? That's what I like most about you. You always believed in me. [holds hand out for a fist-bump]
|-
!Star
|Oh, no, I... I always do that wrong. You know, that fist punchy thingy.
|-
!Oskar
|What are you talking about? You can't do it wrong. Just do what you feel.
|-
!Star
|[puts hand on Oskar's fist] Is this okay? [''Oskar blushes]''

!
|''Scene cuts back to Ludo's temple; the Magic High Commission searches for Glossaryck.''

!Rhombulus
|You're a liar!
|-
!Lekmet
|Baaa?

|-
!Lekmet
|Hmm? [spits out corn, picks up book] Baaaa! [echoing]
|-
!
|''Hekapoo, Omnitraxus, and Rhombulus regroup with Lekmet.''
|-
!Omnitraxus
|You found Glossaryck?
|-
!Lekmet
|Baaaa!
|-
!
|''Lekmet opens the book; its pages are blank.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|Blank?
|-
!Hekapoo
|That's not the real book.
|-
!
|''Rhombulus, Hekapoo, and Lekmet return to Moon and Ludo.''

!Hekapoo
|Ludo?
|-
!Ludo (Toffee)
|Ludo's not here right now. But if you'd like, you can leave a message.

!
|''Toffee blasts Omnitraxus with dark magic, reducing him to only a skull mask.''

!Rhombulus, Hekapoo, and Lekmet
|[gasps]

!
|''Toffee absorbs Omnitraxus' power, and he rises off the ground with Omnitraxus' crags sticking out of the bottom of his crystallized legs.''
|-
!Rhombulus
|That's it!
|-
!
|''Rhombulus attacks Toffee, but Toffee blasts him away. Hekapoo, using a disconnected pair of dimensional scissors like daggers, attacks Toffee with a flurry of thrusts, but Toffee lifts her up and down onto the ground. He starts to absorb Hekapoo's power, but Rhombulus blasts him in the back. While Toffee fights Rhombulus, Lekmet revives Hekapoo.''

!Ludo (Toffee)
|[laughing]
|-
!
|''Toffee grabs Moon with long vines and pulls her toward him. Moon makes a sword of magic energy and clashes swords with Toffee. Toffee shatters Moon's sword, and she falls to the ground. As Toffee hovers over Moon, Moon creates a great explosion that brings the roof down on top of Toffee. Moon picks up Hekapoo's scissors and opens a portal. She throws Rhombulus into the portal and gathers Lekmet's ashes and Omnitraxus' mask. As she picks up Hekapoo, Toffee rises from the rubble. Moon blasts a pair of pillars to collapse the ground between them. As the temple crumbles, Moon carries Hekapoo to the portal.''

|So you just say stuff and magic comes out?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, pretty much. I've even been creating my own spells. Want to see?
|-
!Oskar
|Yeah, I'd be honored.
|-
!Star
|Okay, I haven't practiced this one too much, so if your body explodes, whoopsie-doopsies! Heh. That's a little magic joke for you.
|-
!Oskar
|Oh. [laughs nervously]
|-
!Star
|Okay. [inhales] Sparkle Kitten Fireworks Shower! [creates fireworks that explode into raining kittens]

!Star
|Aw, geez, I gotta stop making cats.
|-
!Oskar
|[laughs] Seriously, how have we not hung out before?
|-
!Star
|Well, I'm usually pretty busy fighting monsters and stuff.
|-
!Oskar
|Oh, yeah, with your buddy. What's his name? [snaps fingers] Mango! It's always just you and Mango.
|-
!Star
|Oh, Marco.
|-
!Oskar
|Yeah. Where's Mango?
|-
!Star
|Well, Mango's going out with Jackie now, so he'll probably have less time to hang out with me.
|-
!Oskar
|Well, I'm not doing anything this summer. I'd make a great Mango.
|-
!Star
|Oh, uh... Yeah.

|Hey, Star? I had a great time tonight. I think we could have an awesome summer together.
|-
!Star
|[laughing nervously] Yeah, maybe we could.

|Good-bye!

!Janna
|Good work, Star.
|-
!Kelly
|Great work.
|-
!Pony Head
|That's some fine work.
|-
!Star
|[embarrassed] Ew, gals, stop! You know, maybe this summer thing won't be that bad.
|-
!StarFan13
|[carrying a dozen cats] We're off to a pretty great start already!

!Star
|Yeah. I guess there's just one thing to take care of.

|All right, Star, let's get awkward.

!Jackie
|Okay, now do me. Ahhhhh...
|-
!Star
|Uh, hey, Marco? You got a sec?
|-
!Marco
|Star? [walks away from Jackie]
|-
!Jackie
|...ahhhhhhhhhh...
|-
!Star and Marco
|[Marco] I have to tell you something. [chuckling nervously]<br />[Star] We need to talk. [chuckling nervously]
|-
!Star
|Let's go somewhere more quiet.
|-
!
|''Star and Marco sit on the stairs.''
|-
!Star
|Okay... [inhales deeply] Marco, I know things have been "different".
|-
!Marco
|Definitely "different".
|-
!Star
|I wanted to talk to you after Song Day, but I feel like we've been avoiding each other.
|-
!Marco
|Oh, I've definitely been avoiding you.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, me, too. I guess I just got scared that everything would change and that you didn't want to be friends anymore, and I miss the way things used to be, and, and...!
|-
!Marco
|Star. I miss the way things used to be, too.
|-
!Star
|[gasps] You do?
|-
!Marco
|Yeah. You're my best friend. But... but do you have a crush on me?
|-
!Star
|Uhhh... No. I don't.
|-
!Marco
|But the song...
|-
!Star
|Marco, you're my friend, and I just want to have an awesome summer with my friend.
|-
!Marco
|Friend?
|-
!Star
|Friend. [hugs Marco]
|-
!Marco
|Well, maybe let's just forget Song Day ever happened.
|-
!Star
|What's a Song Day? That sounds like a terrible day.
|-
!Marco
|[chuckles] You know, I think we deserve a couple of months where we just don't do anything.
|-
!Star
|That sounds great.
|-
!Marco
|Star, it's called summer, and it's gonna be great.
|-
!Star
|[whispers] Great.

!
|''Star goes upstairs to her room and finds an open dimensional portal.''

|-
!Moon
|(''o.s.'') Star!
|-
!Star
|Aah! Demon! ...Mom? Wha... What are you doing here?
|-
!Moon
|I don't have time to explain, but suffice it to say, we are in danger. We must leave for Mewni immediately.
|-
!Star
|What? Mom, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No!
|-
!Moon
|Yes, I'm afraid you have no choice in the matter.
|-
!Star
|You sent me here, and I didn't have a choice, and now you're just telling me to leave?
|-
!Moon
|Star, this is different.
|-
!Star
|Mom, I've learned that I get to make choices here. I chose to fix things with Marco.
|-
!Moon
|Star.
|-
!Star
|I'm choosing to have a crush on Oskar, I guess.
|-
!Moon
|Star.
|-
!Star
|And apparently, there's this thing called "summer", where you just don't go to school.
|-
!Moon
|Star.
|-
!Star
|So I'm choosing to stay here with my friend...

!Moon
|Star!

!Star
|...and I'm not changing my mind!
|-
!Moon
|''Star!''
|-
!Star
|'''''WHAT?!?'''''
|-
!Moon
|...Toffee has returned.
|-
!Star
|[eyes widen] No. No, no, no, no, no. [she picks up a picture of her and Marco and gazes at it sadly]
|-
!Moon
|I'm sorry, Star, but you need to leave.
|-
!Star
|[sighs] I need two minutes.
|-
!
|''Star goes back downstairs.''
|-
!Star
|Mmm... [shouting] ''Marco!''
|-
!All
|[gasps]
|-
!Pony Head
|Loud.
|-
!Marco
|Star?
|-
!Star
|Marco, we need to talk. Just one last time.
|-
!Marco
|Is everything okay? You shouted pretty loud. Everybody's just staring at us.
|-
!Star
|Yeah, I know. But some stuff just came up, and I've only got a little time.
|-
!Marco
|What? Why? We got the entire summer.
|-
!Star
|Marco, I don't know how to tell you this, because you're my best friend...
|-
!Marco
|Star?
|-
!Star
|...and that makes this super weird because...
|-
!Marco
|What's wrong?
|-
!Star
|...because I... I... I ''do'' have a crush on you.
|-
!All
|[gasps]
|-
!Pony Head
|Who called it?! I called it! Boom!
|-
!StarFan13
|[faints]
|-
!Pony Head
|I called it.
|-
!Star
|I didn't want to admit it because I know you don't feel the same way, and I thought if I just pretended the feelings weren't there, they'd go away. But they haven't. I have to leave Earth, probably forever, and I couldn't go without telling you the truth.
|-
!Marco
|Uh... I, uh...
|-
!Star
|[crying] Good-bye! Good-bye, everyone! [runs back upstairs]
|-
!Marco
|Star! [follows Star upstairs] Hey!
|-
!
|''As camera follows Marco, Janna looks at Jackie, who appears stunned. Star runs inside her room and shuts the door. There's a bright flash of light inside.''
|-
!Marco
|[opens Star's door] What do you meanâ€”? [gasps]
|-
!
|''Star's bedroom reverts to the state it was in before she moved in.''
|-
!Marco
|Star?
|-
!
|''Episode ends on an exterior shot of the Diaz Household as Star's loft vanishes. Closing credits play over the same shot with complete silence. Just before the "Disney Television Animation" logo, Oskar's keytar falls out of the sky.''
