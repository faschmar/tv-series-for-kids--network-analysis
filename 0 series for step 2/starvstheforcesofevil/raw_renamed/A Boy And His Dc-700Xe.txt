|-
![[Marco Diaz]],<br />[[Hekapoo]], [[Kelly]], [[Talon Raventalon]], and [[Quirky Guy]]
|Cheers! [cheer, clink glasses and mugs together] To the Kill Devil Pass Riders Club annual ride!
|-
!Talon
|[guzzles mug of worms, belches] So, uh, who do you think will be cursed with the Devil's Mark this year?
|-
!Quirky Guy
|[with fingers crossed] Please let it be me! Please let it be me!
|-
!Talon
|Devil's Mark goes to the worst rider. Why would you want that?
|-
!Quirky
|'Cause I'm quirky?
|-
!Talon
|[puts his arm around Quirky Guy] Well, I'll be rootin' for ya, weird little dude.
|-
!Hekapoo
|Hey, Kelly, the new vest looks good on ya.
|-
!Kelly
|Thanks, Hekapoo. Official membership feels great.
|-
!Hekapoo
|You know, I think this is the best group we've ever put together for the annual ride.
|-
!Talon
|Talon wouldn't change a thing!
|-
!Kelly
|Me, neither!
|-
!Marco
|Ha! Uh, funny you should say that. I actually, uh... [puts drink over his mouth] [muffled] ...invited someone else this year. [guzzles his drink]
|-
!Kelly
|Uh, what?
|-
!Hekapoo
|Without telling us?!
|-
!Quirky
|Uh, Quirky don't like surprises!
|-
!Talon
|Not cool, Marco.
|-
!Marco
|Don't worry, guys! It'll be fine. He's a total pro.
|-
!
|''[[Tom Lucitor|Tom]], riding a dragon-cycle, crashes into the side of the tavern.''
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|[groans]
|-
!Marco
|Oh, my gosh, Tom! Are you okay?
|-
!Tom
|Oh, yeah! Yeah, me? Totally fine. I'm totally fine. I-I-I'm good.
|-
!Marco
|You always know how to make a grand entrance. Guys, you know Tom.
|-
!Hekapoo, Kelly, Talon, and Quirky
|[unenthused] Hi.
|-
!Tom
|I'm still just getting used to the new drag. ...Or, uh, d-dragon cycle?
|-
!Talon
|Hmm. [to Quirky] Looks like you're gonna have a little competition for that Devil's Mark, li'l dude.
|-
!Quirky
|But I was supposed to be the belle of the ball!
|-
!Marco
|Oh. Well, here's the problem. You gotta take off the hood so he can see.
|-
!
|''Marco removes Tom's dragon-cycle's hood off his face.''
|-
!Hampton
|[bellows]
|-
!Tom
|Whoa! It's alive?! [falls over]
|-
!Marco
|[shushing]. Whoa there, whoa there. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. It's... It's okay.
|-
!Hampton
|[purrs]
|-
!Tom
|I didn't know it was alive!
|-
!Marco
|[laughs] Good one.
|-
!Kelly
|Let's just get this show on the road.
|-
!
|''Quirky Guy, Kelly, Hekapoo, Talon, Marco, and Tom line up at a white line with their dragon-cycles.''
|-
!Hampton
|[growls, fidgets]
|-
!Tom
|Whoa! Gah! It's obviously not used to— Whoa! —having a driver.
|-
!Marco
|[pets Hampton] Yeah, the young ones, they usually take a little time to calm down. You know, there's no shame in backing out of the ride. Maybe get to know Hampton a little better.
|-
!Tom
|[puts on sunglasses with three lenses] Nah, he'll learn on the go.
|-
!Marco
|Okay. Let's ride!
|-
!
|''All the cycle riders, except Tom, take off into the air.''
|-
!Riders
|[cheering]
|-
!Quirky
|Quirky's goin' fast!
|-
!Tom
|All right, let me just—
|-
!
|''Hampton suddenly speeds forward on his own.''
|-
!Tom
|Whoa! Aah!
|-
!Marco
|Everything okay?
|-
!Tom
|Yeah, just tryin' out some new tricks! You go ahead, and I'll catch up! Whoa!
|-
!Marco
|All right, Kill Devils Pass Riders Club! Let's shred some sky!
|-
!Riders
|Woo-hoo!
|-
!
|''Tom and Hampton are still riding on the ground.''
|-
!Tom
|Agh, c'mon! Get in the air! Get in the air!
|-
!Hampton
|[growls]
|-
!
|''Hampton suddenly stops and tosses Tom off.''
|-
!Tom
|Aaaghh! Aaaah! [lands face-down on the ground]
|-
!Hekapoo
|[to Marco] So he's a total pro, huh?
|-
!Marco
|How about you guys just go ahead, and we'll meet you at Dragon Bone's rest stop?
|-
!Hekapoo
|All right, but just don't spend all day with Lucitor.
|-
!
|''Hekapoo and Talon ride ahead. Marco walks up to Tom.''
|-
!Marco
|Tom, you okay?
|-
!Tom
|[gives Marco a thumbs-up] [strained] Yeah, just takin' a little rest.
|-
!Marco
|C'mon, man, it's obvious you've never ridden a dragon-cycle before.
|-
!Tom
|What gave it away?
|-
!Hampton
|[speeds around, screams]
|-
!Marco
|Tom, if you're gonna do this, you're gonna have to get to know Hampton. [points at Hampton's collar tag]
|-
!Tom
|Who's Hampton?
|-
!Marco
|Ugh.
|-
!Hampton
|[growls]
|-
!
|''Marco uses an oven mitt to brush off [[Nachos]]' loose scales.''
|-
!Marco
|Half of dragon-cycling is just forming a bond with your cycle. [to Nachos] There you go, buddy. That's the spot. 
|-
!Nachos
|[growls, kicks her leg]
|-
!Marco
|Dragons are living creatures, not some expensive product you buy from a catalog.
|-
!Tom
|Well, technically, they're both, but I see what you mean.
|-
!Marco
|You and Hampton need complete trust between each other. [holding a toothbrush] Ready, Nachos?
|-
!
|''Nachos opens her mouth wide, and Marco sticks his head inside to brush her teeth.''
|-
!Marco
|See? Complete trust.
|-
!Tom
|All right. Let's develop some trust, Hampton.
|-
!Hampton
|[growls]
|-
!
|''Tom uses a brush mop to clean Hampton's scales.''
|-
!Tom
|Okay, light touch.
|-
!
|''..polishes his tail spikes...''
|-
!Tom
|And a little under there.
|-
!
|''...and irons his wings.''
|-
!Tom
|And right there. Phew! All right. [holds a toothbrush] Open up, Hampton.
|-
!Hampton
|Hrmpf! [turns his head away]
|-
!Tom
|Look, I'm sorry about all the wheelies and not treating you like a living thing.
|-
!Hampton
|[growls]
|-
!Tom
|I... I promise I'll do better.
|-
!Hampton
|...
|-
!
|''Hampton opens his mouth wide to reveal multiple rows of teeth. Tom looks back at Marco, who gives him a thumbs-up.''
|-
!Tom
|Okay, bud. Okay, yeah, here we go. I'm just gonna lean in here, and... [brushes one tooth] Hey, he didn't bite me!
|-
!
|''Hampton snaps his mouth closed.''
|-
!Marco
|Now let's go for a little ride.
|-
!
|''Marco and Tom take a slow ride on their dragon-cycles.''
|-
!Tom
|Whoo! I'm doing it! I feel so free!
|-
!Marco
|Nice, nice. Now just follow me! [takes Nachos up into the air]
|-
!Tom
|Hampton, let's go up. Please.
|-
!Hampton
|[growls, takes off into the air]
|-
!Tom
|Whooaaa! Oh! I'm... I'm really flying! This is incredible! Hey, thanks for doing this, man. I know I'm taking time away from you and your lady friend.
|-
!Kelly
|Actually, Kelly and I decided to stop doing the break-up buddies thing. But it's cool. Things were super amicable.
|-
!Tom
|Cool.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the Dragon Bones rest stop; Kelly, Hekapoo, Talon, and Quirky are around a campfire.''
|-
!Kelly
|How sad is that? My break-up buddy broke up with me.
|-
!Hekapoo
|Yeah. That's why I only date the dummies. Ain't that right, boys?
|-
!Talon and Quirky
|What?
|-
!
|''Marco, Nachos, Tom, and Hampton arrive.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey, everybody!
|-
!Talon
|Ohhhh! The lovebirds finally show up!
|-
!Kelly
|Hey, careful, Tom. Being break-up buddies isn't all it's cracked up to be. [high-fives Hekapoo]
|-
!Marco
|Uh... so are we going to this jump or what?
|-
!Quirky
|Let's get rolling! Quirky needs a Devil Mark! Woo-hoo! [takes off on his dragon-cycle] Varooom!
|-
!Marco
|[to Marco] Hey, the ride starts getting pretty intense. You sure you wanna keep going?
|-
!Tom
|[nervously] Yeah! Let's get intense.
|-
!
|''Marco, Hekapoo, Kelly, Talon, and Quirky ride their cycles through a narrow gorge. Tom ahd Hampton ride uncontrollably, scraping against the gorge walls.''
|-
!Tom
|Aaaah! Whoa! Aaah! Aah! Aah!
|-
!Bats
|[screeching]
|-
!Kelly
|Poor guy's havin' a hard time, huh?
|-
!Marco
|Can't get much worse than that.
|-
!
|''A herd of wild dragon-cycles appears behind the Riders Club.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Wild dragon-cycles, incoming!
|-
!
|''The wild dragon-cycles fly past the riders and Tom.''
|-
!Tom
|Aaah!
|-
!Hampton
|[whimpering]
|-
!Tom
|Uh, Hampton?
|-
!
|''Hampton speeds ahead to ride with the wild dragon-cycles.''
|-
!Tom
|Whoa! Aah! No-no-no-no! Hampton! Hampton! Bad! Bad Hampton! Aaaah!
|-
!Hekapoo
|Looks like his cycle would rather be with the wild herd than with Tom.
|-
!Tom
|Hampton, I swear, if you don't stop right now...!
|-
!Hampton
|[screeches to a stop]
|-
!Tom
|Oof!
|-
!Marco
|Hey, buddy. You doing all right?
|-
!Tom
|Oh, man! This is the... I mean, thrill of a lifetime!
|-
!Marco
|We're coming up on the Devil's Mark jump up ahead. It's pretty dangerous. You really think you're ready?
|-
!Tom
|Dragon-cycles already fly, right? I mean, how hard could a jump be?
|-
!
|''Cut to The Riders Club in front of a giant ramp jump that goes over a valley of spikes. Thunder strikes in the sky.''
|-
!Tom
|[nervously] See? I mean, that... Yeah, that... that looks cool.
|-
!Talon
|You think that's cool? Check this out!
|-
!
|''Talon tosses a rock into the valley of spikes. A giant arm comes out one of the holes in the gorge walls an punches the rock into the wall across.''
|-
!Tom
|Oh, mama.
|-
!Quirky
|That's gonna be me! That's gonna be me!
|-
!Hekapoo
|[revs up her dragon-cycle] Are you weenies just gonna stand around all day? Yee-haw!
|-
!
|''Hekapoo rides her cycle off the ramp and high into the air.''
|-
!Tom
|Oh, my goodness.
|-
!Marco
|Hey, Tom? You don't have to do the jump.
|-
!Tom
|[nervously] What? And miss out on all that sweet air?
|-
!
|''Hekapoo and her cycle fly across the valley of spikes, dodging the giant punching arms...''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Whoo-hoo! Whoo!
|-
!
|''...eventually landing on the other side.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Whoo!
|-
!Tom
|Totally rockin', H-Poo!
|-
!Marco
|Look, buddy. I don't know if you're ready for a jump like this just yet.
|-
!Tom
|Oh, nah, we got this.
|-
!Kelly
|My turn! Woo-hoo-hoo!
|-
!
|''Kelly rides her cycle off the ramp and into the air. As they fly across the valley of spikes, they get hit by one of the giant punching arms...''
|-
!Kelly
|Aaagh! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. c'mon!
|-
!
|''...but manage to land safely on the other side.''
|-
!Kelly
|[sighs, laughs]
|-
!Talon
|[to Tom] Your dude is right. You ain't ready for this! Yaaaah!
|-
!
|''Talon rides his cycle off the ramp and into the air. When they land on the other side, they crash.''
|-
!Kelly and Hekapoo
|[cheering]
|-
!Talon
|[gives a thumbs-up] My best one yet!
|-
!Marco
|Tom. Seriously.
|-
!Tom
|I'm doing the jump, Marco.
|-
!Marco
|But why? Nobody's pressuring you to do this.
|-
!Tom
|''You're'' doing it. You always do cool stuff like this.
|-
!Marco
|I'm not the cool one. You are!
|-
!Tom
|Yeah, that's what ''I'' thought! But then I actually realized that I don't really do anything. So I bought a dragon-cycle, and I'm gonna do this terrifying jump.
|-
!Quirky
|Don't do it, kid. That's Quirky's Devil Mark!
|-
!
|''Quirky rides his cycle off the ramp and into the air.''
|-
!Quirky
|Here I am! Come and get me!
|-
!
|''A giant arm flies toward Quirky. He lifts up his shirt to reveal a bull's-eye painted on his stomach.''
|-
!Quirky
|Come to Papa!
|-
!
|''The giant arm punches Quirky into the gorge wall.''
|-
!Hekapoo
|Ooh! That's gonna leave a mark.
|-
!Talon
|Ouch!
|-
!
|''When the giant arm moves away, Quirky has an imprint of the arm's devil ring in his stomach.''
|-
!Quirky
|[strained] Hey, guys, check it out. I got the mark!
|-
!Hekapoo, Kelly, and Talon
|[cheering]
|-
!Marco
|Tom, I really like the idea of me being the cool one, but... Dude, just do the stuff you want to do. Then it doesn't matter if it's cool or not. So I'm gonna jump this cliff. Not because it's cool, but because I like jumping cliffs!
|-
!
|''Marco farts and blushes.''
|-
!Tom
|...Dude, did you just fart?
|-
!
|''A silent Marco rides his cycle off the ramp and very high into the air.''
|-
!Marco
|I did! [echoing]
|-
!Tom
|Man, that guy is so cool.
|-
!
|''Marco lands on the other side of the jump.''
|-
!Hekapoo, Kelly, Talon, and Quirky
|[cheering]
|-
!Marco
|Thank you! Thank you!
|-
!Kelly
|Tom's not really thinking about doing the jump, right?
|-
!Marco
|I... I really hope not.
|-
!Tom
|[sitting on Hampton] You ready, Hampton? Let's shred some sky.
|-
!
|''The wild dragon-cycles fly overhead and roar.''
|-
!Tom
|Wow. They're so free. You just wanna be up there, don't ya?
|-
!Hampton
|[whimpering]
|-
!Talon
|Hey, what's he doing?
|-
!Marco
|Something pretty cool.
|-
!Kelly
|Ughhh!
|-
!Tom
|What are we doing? You don't wanna do this jump. I don't wanna do this jump. Hampton, I'm sorry. You should do what you want. [removes Hampton's collar'
|-
!Hampton
|[confused growl]
|-
!Tom
|Be free!
|-
!
|''Hampton drives in reverse and takes off into the sky.''
|-
!Tom
|Have fun with those wild dragon-cycles, buddy.
|-
!Marco
|Hey, Tom! I'm not sure what just happened, but I'll come back to pick you up!
|-
!Tom
|That's cool, Marco. I have my own way.
|-
!
|''Tom runs up the ramp, uses his fire powers to take off into the air, and blasts across the valley.''
|-
!Tom
|[laughing]
|-
!Marco
|Oh, yeah! He can fly! Way to go, Tom!
|-
!Hekapoo, Kelly, Talon, and Quirky
|[cheering]
|-
!
|''Tom dodges the giant punching arm, but at the last second, one punches him into the gorge wall. In the next scene, he has bruises and three black eyes.''
|-
!Tom
|[groans] Why did I do that?
|-
!Talon
|You took that hit like a total champ! Now let's see that Devil Mark!
|-
!Tom
|Oh, right. Let's see here.
|-
!
|''Tom lifts up his shirt. He is covered in bruises and broken ribs.''
|-
!Quirky
|Oh, thank goodness. He ain't nothin' but bruises.
|-
!Hekapoo
|[gives Tom a Kill Devil Pass Riders Club jacket] You may not have a dragon-cycle, but you definitely earned this.
|-
!Tom
|I'm part of the club?!
|-
!Quirky
|Maybe next year, you'll get one of these bad boys. Check it out. It's embossed in the back.
|-
!Tom
|Oh. Lucky.
|-
!Marco
|So, you coming back next year?
|-
!Tom
|[puts on the club jacket] We'll see. I think I'm just gonna do what I want. But... But no. I'm... I'm definitely not gonna do this again.
|-
!
|''Hampton and the wild dragon-cycles ride off into the sunset.''
