|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|[on [[interdimensional mirror]]] Ugghh! Mom! Worst. Song. Ever. Do I have to have one of those written about me?
|-
!Moon
|Yes, Star. It's a tradition as old as the kingdom itself. And it's your official introduction as future queen to the people of [[Mewni]].
|-
!Star
|That song didn't say anything about the ''real'' you. You could plug any name into that song, and it wouldn't make a lick of difference. How about... [sarcastic] Buttercup! Sparkle! Snowflake! They all happen to love puppies and smell like lavender? ''Wow''.
|-
!Moon
|I don't have time for this, Star. Preparations for your Song Day celebration are already underway, and the new official songstrel of Mewni is heading to Earth to write your song as we speak.
|-
!Star
|[groans] ''Fine.''
|-
!Moon
|And remember, Star, the people of Mewni like their Princess Songs light and fluffy. Can you handle that?
|-
!Star
|Yes, Mom. [closes mirror curtains] Oh, I can handle it – by avoiding this problem until it goes away.
|-

|''Scene cuts back to [[King Butterfly|King River]] and Queen Moon in Mewni.''
|-
!River Butterfly
|Moon, please. If I can't talk you out of going, at least take a bunch of our knights with you!
|-
!Moon
|I told you, River, this has to stay low-key, under the radar. Besides, I've been there before. It's perfectly safe.
|-
!River
|The [[Forest of Certain Death]] is ''not'' safe! And likely nothing on Mewni is as safe as it used to be.
|-
!Moon
|I promise you, I can handle myself. [kisses River's cheek and gives him her crown] Hold down the castle until I return.
|-
!River
|[sets Moon's crown down behind him] Can't you just take one little knight?
|-
!
|''River turns around. Moon is gone. He looks out the window and sees her trotting away on warnicornback.''
|-
!River
|[echoing] At least call me when you get there!

!
|''Scene cuts back to Earth. A [[dimensional portal]] opens down the street from the [[Diaz Household]], and a carriage of [[manticore]]s comes out. [[Ruberiot]] comes out of the carriage and rings the Diaz Household doorbell.''
|-
!Star
|[answers door] Ha-ha. The songstrel.
|-
!Ruberiot
|Greetings, Princess Star! I am Ruberiot. [plays lute]<br />♪ And may I just say ♪<br />♪ Though we have much to do ♪<br />♪ How much of a pleasure it is to meet you ♪<br />♪ I'll write you a— ♪
|-
!Star
|Stop. I get it. Come in.
|-
!Ruberiot
|So, this shouldn't take too long. [takes out pad and pencil] I just want to get to know the ''real'' Star.
|-
!Star
|Oh, how rude of me! [laughs] I didn't even offer you anything. What can I get you? Water? Juice? Tea?
|-
!Ruberiot
|Ha. Well, if you have mint tea, that might be—
|-
!Star
|As a matter of fact, we do! [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] is a member of the Tea of the Month Club, and I think we just got some super-special mint tea. Right, Marco? Don't move!
|-
!Marco Diaz
|[flipping TV channels] Tea of the Month Club?
|-
!
|''Star goes into the kitchen and makes various "tea-making" noises: opening and closing cupboards, tossing teabags, etc.''
|-
!Star
|Should be just a minute!
|-
!
|''Marco and Ruberiot sit motionless on the couch. Ruberiot starts strumming his lute. Marco turns up the volume on the TV.''
|-
!Star
|Oh, this tea is real good! [summons [[Cloudy]]]
|-
!Cloudy
|Hey, Star!
|-
!Star
|Cloudy! Let's get out of here. [takes out phone and flies toward mall] Hey, [[Janna]] Banana, want to go to the mall?

|''A Venus flytrap-like monster on the ground opens its maw.''
|-
!Moon
|Easy, girl. Almost there.
|-
!
|''Moon and her warnicorn jump over the flytrap monster, and its mouth snaps closed. They continue on to a small villa with a red roof and a large tree growing through it. Moon gets off her unicorn and knocks on the boarded-up door.''
|-
!Lord Brudo
|[in a low-hanging door slot] What is it?
|-
!Moon
|Hello, Lord Brudo.
|-
!Brudo
|Huh? Queen Moon. Hmph. What do you want?
|-
!Moon
|I need to speak with you. It's very important.
|-
!Brudo
|[grumbles] Step back. [unlocks door] Hmm. Ahem. You... you coming here to what?
|-
!Moon
|Eh, you're... you're blocking the door.
|-
!Brudo
|I'll move. Geez. [squeezes through door and drops crown]
|-
!Moon
|[enters house]
|-
!Brudo
|Not even gonna pick up a guy's crown for him. [picks up crown, closes door, and drops crown again] [grumbling] My dear, we have company. You may want to get dressed.
|-
!Lady Avarius
|Oh, Queen Moon! To what do we owe the, uh, honor of this visit?
|-
!Moon
|I'm sorry to intrude. Please accept this bag of corn.
|-
!Brudo
|Corn?! We don't need corn! We're doing great, thanks!
|-
!Avarius
|But perhaps we can find someone else who could use it! [slips bag of corn into her cloak] So, what brings you here, Queen Moon?
|-
!Moon
|I'm here because your son took a very important book from my family.
|-
!Avarius
|My son? Which one? Crudo?
|-
!Moon
|Eh, no.
|-
!Avarius
|Not Yudo!
|-
!Moon
|Mm-mmm.
|-
!Avarius
|Menudo?
|-
!Moon
|Uh, nope.
|-
!Avarius
|Ugh. Okay, I'm just gonna go down the list. Dudo, Kudo, Mudo, Tudo, Fudo, Zudo, Udo...
|-
!Moon
|I have no idea who that is.
|-
!Avarius
|Not [[Dennis]]!
|-
!Dennis
|[peeks out from behind a chair]
|-
!Moon
|No, no, it's... it's [[Ludo]].
|-
!Avarius
|[gasps] Ludo?! Well, w-we don't say that name in this house anymore! Not since he and his goons took over our castle and changed the locks when we were on vacation! N-Not that this place isn't lovely...
|-
!Moon
|Do you know where he is now?
|-
!Avarius
|We don't. You know, he is a grave disappointment to us.
|-
!Brudo
|Well, what do you expect?! We had a lot of kids. Ludo was the runt. He didn't even fit in our family portrait. We were extra hard on him to toughen him up. And look what happened! Was he grateful? No! Instead, he destroyed our ancestral home and brought shame on the family name!
|-
!Moon
|There, there. We can't always control the path our children choose to take.
|-
!
|''Cut to Moon leaving Brudo and Avarius' residence.''
|-
!Moon
|Thank you, Lord and Lady Avarius. If you hear from Ludo, please let me know. [trots away]

|''The door opens.''
|-
!Ruberiot
|Hey!
|-
!
|''Star stands in the doorway wearing a sun hat and sunglasses and carrying a purse.''
|-
!Marco and Ruberiot
|You're back!
|-
!Star
|You're still here. ...Well, goodbye. [turns around to leave]
|-
!Ruberiot
|Please! Princess! [kneels on the ground] I have a job to do, and I can't leave until it's done.
|-
!Star
|And ''I'' won't stay until you're gone.
|-
!Ruberiot
|But... what about your Song Day celebration? In just a day, the people of Mewni will be expecting us to perform the traditional Princess Song—
|-
!Star
|Ah-ah-ah-ah! I don't want to hear it, songstrel. If you don't leave right now, maybe I'll leave for good.
|-
!Marco
|Hey, Star! Before you leave us alone again—for a very long time with no explanation—could you help me make some more popcorn in the kitchen? [moves off-screen] ''Kit-chen!''
|-
!
|''Star joins Marco in the kitchen and gives the "I'm-watching-you" signal to Ruberiot.''
|-
!Marco
|Please. Just do what he says. He's been singing at me for eight hours, asking where you are!
|-
!Star
|Well, I'm sorry, but I don't want anything to do with Ruberiot and his stupid Princess Songs. My mom's was so stupid and so fake and so old-fashioned – it's just not me.
|-
!Marco
|It's okay, Star. Everyone knows you're anything but ordinary.
|-
!Star
|Aww. Thanks, Marco. [hugs Marco] Huuuugs. ...He's, uh... he's staring at us, isn't he?
|-
!Ruberiot
|[stares at Marco and Star from the couch]
|-
!Marco
|Yup.
|-
!Star
|Ugghh! Fine. Ru-ber-i-ot – if that even is your real name – You. Me. My room. Talk time.
|-

|''Scene cuts back to Queen Moon in the Forest of Certain Death. Something stalks her from the treetops.''
|-
!Moon
|I know you're there. Come on out if you know what's good for you.
|-
!
|''Dennis drops out from the trees in front of Moon.''
|-
!Moon
|What do you want?
|-
!Dennis
|It's me. Dennis. You were just at my house.
|-
!Moon
|Why are you following me?
|-
!Dennis
|Are you looking for my big brother because you want to help him?
|-
!Moon
|Help him what?
|-
!Dennis
|He's not well.
|-
!Moon
|Do you know where he is?
|-
!Dennis
|I can take you to him. [kneels down with his back to Moon]
|-
!Moon
|Oh, uh... what ''is'' this?
|-
!Dennis
|We must go by wing, M'lady.
|-
!Moon
|Oh. ...All right, then, well, let me just... hold on... [gasping]
|-
!
|''Dennis takes off into the air with Moon on her back and heads into the mountains. They rest on a mountaintop adjacent to Ludo's monster temple.''
|-
!Dennis
|He's over there.
|-
!
|''Moon uses her telescopes to see Ludo stirring broth in a pot.''
|-
!Moon
|What is that?
|-
!
|''She sees Ludo taste the soup with the wand.''
|-
!Moon
|[deep gasp]
|-
!Dennis
|What is it?
|-
!Moon
|We have to go. We have to go ''now''.
|-
!
|''Ludo briefly looks straight at the camera. Scene cuts to black, then to Star's bedroom.''
|-
!Ruberiot
|It's an honor to be your official songstrel, your Highness. I have some really exciting ideas that I can't wait to get your opinion on.
|-
!Star
|Ruby, just stop. Please. I know my mom sent you here, but honestly, I am sorry, I can't help you. Princess Songs are objectively awful. They are these trite little puff pieces about perfect little princesses with perfect little lives, and that's not me! And songstrels like you are part of the problem! Your music just puts pressure on future princesses to be perfect! So you might as well take your stupid notebook and your stupid lute and go back to Mewni, because I have no interest in helping some stupid hack write a stupid Princess Song!
|-
!Ruberiot
|...Oh, really?
|-
!Star
|Yeah, really!
|-
!Ruberiot
|Fine. [tosses pad and pen away] But for what it's worth, I also think the songstrels before me were hacks. You didn't think I had an opinion? That maybe I had some integrity? I wanted to write a real song about a real princess with all her gifts and flaws. [pulls Star's mirror curtain] Don't Mewmans deserve to know their future queen? [voice cracking] But you won't even help me do my job! [sniffling] I might as well just take your mom's song and just plug your name in and be done with it! You know, like some kind of hack! [leaves through dimensional portal]
|-
!Star
|Wait! Ah, no! No-no-no-no-no! Ruby!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts back to the Forest of Certain Death; Dennis sets Moon down next to her warnicorn.''
|-
!Dennis
|So, can you help him?
|-
!Moon
|I'll... I'll do what I can. [rides away]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Ruberiot's house; he sits in front of a piano.''
|-
!Ruberiot
|♪ Perfect Princess Star is great in every way... ♪<br />Hmm.<br />♪ Perfect Princess Star is— ♪<br />Argggh! [slams head on piano keys] It's so awful! [makes discordant note clusters with his face]<br />♪ Stupid Princess Song! ♪<br/ />♪ Why do I even try? ♪<br />Face it, Ruberiot. You ''are'' a hack like all the rest. [crumples sheet music and tosses it away] You'll never amount to anything!
|-
!Star
|Whoa. So you're, like, a totally tortured artist. Cool! That is a ''lot'' of paper just to plug a name into a previously existing song.
|-
!Ruberiot
|[soft gasp] What do ''you'' want?
|-
!Star
|You, uh... you forgot your stupid notebook. Ruberiot, do you really hate Princess Songs as much as I do?
|-
!Ruberiot
|I do, Princess. I-I thought I could change them. I-I know they can be better. ''I'' can do better. But the show is tomorrow, and I have nothing! If I go out there with your mom's old song, I'll be just as bad as all the others. [sighs] This is bad. Why did I drop out of lawstrel school? Good-bye, aspirations. Hello, flipping cornburgers.
|-
!Star
|Ruberiot, nothing is that bad when you have a magic wand. How about you and I turn this silly tradition into something real?
|-
!
|''Queen Moon storms into her bedroom and removes her cloak while walking toward the large curtain. She uses her magic to move the curtains away, revealing a door. The diamonds on her cheeks glow, and the diamonds on her gem glow, opening the doors to reveal a suit of armor. Moon suits herself up in the armor.''

|Moon, darling! You're back!

|You're wearing ''that'' to Star's Song Day?

|-
!River
|Oh, you lost one of your curlybadoos, dear. [puts curl on side of Queen Butterlfly back in place]

|''Star and Marco enter.''
|-
!Star
|Hey, everyone! Mom, hi!
|-
!Marco
|Hey, Queen.
|-
!Star
|Oh, my gosh, I had the worst wardrobe malfunction. Do you know how hard it is to find a decent shoulder tassel in an Earth mall? Oh. Hey. You got a little thingy in your hair. [points at Moon's hair]
|-
!Moon
|A what?
|-
!Star
|A little... thingy-thing. [pulls twig out of Moon's hair]
|-
!Moon
|Oh.
|-
!Star
|How'd that get there?
|-
!Moon
|[takes twig from Star] Thank you, dear. ...Star, I want to tell you something.
|-
!Star
|I ''know'' it's not very princess-like to show up late, but did you see traffic on the Royal Mile?
|-
!Moon
|Please, let me finish. I just want to say how... how proud I am of you.
|-
!Star
|What?
|-
!Moon
|I know Princess Songs aren't exactly your cup of tea, and I know I can be... hard on you sometimes, so it means a lot to me that you still went through with it.
|-
!Star
|Thanks, Mom. But, uh... just so you know, Ruby and me, we kinda changed some stuff. I mean, it's just not gonna sound exactly like your Princess Song did. So, you know, don't freak out or anything.
|-
!Moon
|Thank you for telling me, Star, but I trust your judgment.
|-
!Star
|Ohhhh, thank you! But we ''really'' went off-script. It's all good, but there might be, like—
