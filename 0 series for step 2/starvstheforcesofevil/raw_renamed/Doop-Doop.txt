|''Episode begins in [[Marco Diaz]]'s bedroom at the Monster Temple; [[Star Butterfly]] looks an almanac.''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|Hmmm...
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|(''o.s.'') Whatcha lookin' at over there?
|-
!Star
|Oh, it's, uh, Alphonse's Atlas of the Multiverse. [[Tom Lucitor|Tom]] gave it to me, so I could circle places I wanted to go on our trip, but, man, I didn't realize how many places I've already been to.
|-
!Marco
|Oh. Well, in that case, might I recommend... [pulls out a hook from his right sleeve] ...Pie Island? One taste of our pies, and you'll be hooked! [chuckles, drops hook in the box next to him]
|-
!Star
|Oh, [[Pie King]]. I remember him. [in a deep voice] Oh, look at me! I'm the king of pies, and I'm going to make pies out of you! [gnaws on Marco's left sleeve]
|-
!Marco
|[chuckles] Uh, Star?
|-
!Star
|[stops gnawing] Hmm?
|-
!Marco
|I should, uh, probably get going.
|-
!Star
|Oh, yeah! [chuckles] Of course. Gotta head back to [[Earth]].
|-
!Marco
|Still can't believe I'm going to be a big brother!
|-
!Star
|You're going to be such a good big bro.
|-
!
|''[[Janna Ordonia|Janna]] enters the room with a large pile of luggage.''
|-
![[Janna Ordonia]]
|Hey, Diaz. Give me a hand with this stuff, would ya?
|-
!Marco
|Janna, what is all that?
|-
!Janna
|I've acquired a few...
|-
!
|''The top of a pouch falls off, revealing a huge eyeball inside of it.''
|-
!Janna
|...souvenirs. Always lift with your back.
|-
![[Tom Lucitor]]
|Hey, Star! Are you almost ready for our trip?
|-
!Star
|[turns around to see Tom and a couple of backpacks behind him]
|-
!Tom
|These bags are pretty heavy. Aren't they, Petey?
|-
!
|''Camera pans up to reveal a tiny red demon flapping his wings to lift the bags off the ground.''
|-
!Petey
|[pants] Maybe just a little, Master Thomas.
|-
!Star
|[waves] Hi, Petey!
|-
!Marco
|[hugs Star] Have a great trip, guys.
|-
!Star
|[hugs Marco back] Aw, thanks, Marco!
|-
!Tom
|[hugs both of them]
|-
!Janna
|You better send some cheesy postcards!
|-
!Tom
|Oh, you know we will!
|-
!Star
|Oh yeah, you've got some Limburger comin' your way, Janna! [opens [[dimensional portal]] using Marco's [[dimensional scissors]]] Bon voyage!
|-
!Janna
|Whew! Thank goodness for portals. I'd never be able to get this stuff through airport security.
|-
!
|''Janna and Marco walk through the portal, leaving Star alone with Tom and Petey.''
|-
!Tom
|So, are you stoked for our trip?
|-
!Star
|Oh, I am so ready for some time away! I'm done being a princess. [scoffs] I can finally do whatever I want! [laughs] Okay, I just need to say a few goodbyes, then we are out of here!
|-
!Tom
|Hey, no rush! We've got all day.
|-
!Petey
|[sweats and chuckles nervously] All day...
|-
!Star
|Hey, Petey! Look alive! [throws the atlas at Petey]
|-
!
|''The atlas hits Petey, knocking him down to the ground. Scene shifts to the Monster Temple, where calm chattering can be heard.''
|-
!Tom
|Wow, Monster Temple is gonig off!
|-
!Star
|Yeah! It's pretty cool to see things going so well in the kingdom.
|-
!
|''Inside the Monster Temple, [[Mewmans]] and monsters are seen mingling with each other.''
|-
!
|''[[Globgor]] lifts [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]] over the crowd, and Eclipsa waves to Star and Tom.''
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly]]
|Yoo-hoo! Star! Tom!
|-
!
|''Tom and Star approach Eclipsa and Globgor's thrones.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, hello, you two.
|-
![[Meteora Butterfly]]
|[babbles, gives Star a piece of paper with scribbles on it]
|-
!Star
|Oh, what is this, li'l baby Meteora?
|-
![[Glossaryck]]
|Meteora made you a going-away card.
|-
!Star
|Awww! Baby, it's perfect!
|-
!Eclipsa

|''Globgor pulls out a Mewman-shaped cake.''
|-
!Eclipsa and [[Globgor]]
|Surprise!
|-
!Eclipsa
|We baked it ourselves!
|-
!Star
|You baked us... a Mewman?
|-
!Tom
|Yes!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, heavens, no! It's a cake, darling!
|-
!Globgor
|It's vegan!
|-
!Star
|Oh, you guys! [takes head of the Mewman cake and eats it] Mm, that's good Mewman.
|-
!Petey
|Oh, my goodness!
|-
!Tom
|I love you so much.
|-
!Globgor
|We're very sad to see you guys go.
|-
!Eclipsa
|But, even so, though it may be a new chapter for [[Mewni]], it's also a new chapter for you. So get out there and write! Write the rest of your marvelous story!
|-
!Star
|Thank you, Eclipsa. Bye, Globgor! Bye, guys!
|-
!Tom
|Bye, see ya.
|-
!Eclipsa

!Pony Head
|And then it's just, like, little old me. Like, what am I left with? [sheds a rainbow tear]

|-
!Star
|Pony Head, why is Seahorse wearing that blinking bracelet?
|-
!Pony Head
|Oh, he's on probation.
|-
!Seahorse
|If I go outside, I'll explode.

!Star
|[screams]
|-
!
|''Cut to back when Katrina tackles Star. Star opens her eyes, and Katrina stands over her.''

!Katrina
|[autographs cornball] Here you go, Star. It'll be worth a lot of money someday, when I'm a famous athlete. [gives signed cornball to Star]
|-
!Star
|There's not a doubt in my mind that you'll be the next cornball queen! [shoves cornball into Tom's stomach]
|-
!Tom
|Oof!
|-
!Buff Frog
|Is funny thing, Star Butterfly. One moment you are young, having whole life ahead of you. And next, kaboomski! You are fat old Buff Frog with teenagers for boss! [chuckles, hugs his children] As parent, I live for my children's choices now!

|''Scene cuts to [[Moon Butterfly]]'s village of yurt people. Camera pans right and stops at a table, at which Star and Moon are having tea.''
|-
!Star
|[sips tea] So, you probably don't approve of me going on such a long trip, huh?
|-
![[Moon Butterfly]]
|On the contrary, dear. You're going to experience so much! [sips tea]
|-
!Star
|How about you and Dad? What are your plans?
|-
!Moon
|We're actually very happy where we are. I would never have imagined that I would be comfortable living in a house made of sticks and leaves, but there's a beautiful simplicity to life in a yurt. And, of course, your father has his hunting classto keep him busy.
|-

|Uhhhh...
|-
!Star
|Oh, come on! He's real close! [pushes Tom out of the outhouse]
|-
!Doop-Doop
|Huh? Oh, yay, an adventure! All right, let's get going! W-Whoa [falls on the floor face-down] Ugh. Ohhh. I fell down. Just like a regular broom!
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Star and Tom walking through the woods again.''
|-
!Tom
|Star. Okay, w-what, what's going on here? Are we taking this trip or not?
|-
!Star
|Trip? Yeah, of course we're going, Tom! It's just... There's more friends to say goodbye to.
|-
!Tom
|Sorry, more people than Apple Jeff? Who I never heard of before?

|Well... yeah! Like [[Rasticore]]. Uh, t-that [[Gemini|robot guy who used to hang out with Meteora]]. Or is he dead?
|-
!Tom
|Okay, okay, all right, all right. Petey, let me see that atlas.
|-
!Petey

|-
!Tom
|Um, oh. Yeah, okay. Well, that's fine. We can pick a place together.
|-
!Star
|No, I really don't know where to go or what to do.
|-
!Tom
|[gives atlas back to Petey] Star, you're... you're acting like you don't want to go. You do want to go, don't you?
|-
!Star
|I think... I'm really excited to not be a princess. And now that Mewni doesn't need me, now that I'm free... I think I need time to figure things out.
|-
!Tom
|But I... [groans] Oh, I wish you would've told me this sooner!
|-
!Star
|Oh, Tom, please... don't be upset.
|-
!Tom
|[strained] Nope! Not upset! I... don't want to pressure you or anything!
|-
!Star
|Oh, you are upset. I can tell.
|-
!Tom
|Okay! Okay, I'm upset! But I'm allowed to be! Just like how you're allowed to be, uh, you know, I...! [groans, sighs] Look. You should take your time. If you want to. If you need to. [starts walking away]

|-
!Rafael
|For how much money these doctors charge, you'd think they would be much better at their jobs.
|-
!
|''Angie hands the baby to Star, who immediately cradles her in her arms. Mariposa looks at Star before setting her head on Star's chest and cooing. Star smiles warmly at the baby.''
