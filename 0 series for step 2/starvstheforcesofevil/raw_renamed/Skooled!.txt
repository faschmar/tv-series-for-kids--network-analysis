|''Before the coachman can open the carriage door, [[Pony Head]] sticks her nose out the window.''
|-
![[Pony Head]]
|[inhales deeply] I'm back.
|-
!Coachman
|Uh, what?
|-
!Pony Head
|[bursts out of the carriage] I said, I'm back! [bursts into the school] What y'all doing?!
|-
![[St. Olga's princesses]]
|[cheering]
|-
!Pony Head
|Yes, yes, I'm very excited to see me, too. I know how it feels.
|-
!Lizard princess
|[runs up and hugs Pony Head] Pony Head, I missed you so much!
|-
!Pony Head
|Girl, boundaries. [shoves lizard princess off] Now look, I been cooped up with my batty sisters for way too long. So I need to brunch, and then I need to party, pronto! Who wants to watch?
|-
!Princesses
|I do, I do!
|-
!
|''A montage plays of Pony Head and the other princesses partying together, giving each other makeovers, having a pillow fight, and laughing. When the lizard princess hits Pony Head too hard with a pillow, Pony Head hits back hard enough to send the lizard princess flying into the wall.''
|-
!Pony Head and princesses
|[laughing]
|-
!Pony Head
|That's what it is! Okay, that's great, but who wants to get brunched in the face?
|-
![[Princess Arms]]
|[stops the party] Hold on, there. Come with me to my office.
|-
!Pony Head
|You have a office?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to Princess Arms' (formerly [[Miss Heinous]]'s) office. One of the [[Guards of St. Olga's Reform School for Wayward Princesses|robot guards]] serves tea to Pony Head and Princess Arms.''
|-
!Pony Head
|You do realize those robots are killing machines, right?
|-
!Princess Arms
|We reprogrammed them. A lot of things have changed here, and if you wanna brunch, you gonna have to pass a new final.
|-
!Pony Head
|I know how to brunch, Patty!
|-
!Princess Arms
|All right, then. What are the four pillars of brunch?
|-
!Pony Head
|[scoffs] Waffles.
|-
!Princess Arms
|Mm-hmm.
|-
!Pony Head
|Uh... eggs, obviously.
|-
!Princess Arms
|Uh-huh.
|-
!Pony Head
|Buh... Ba-ba-ba... Bacon?
|-
!Princess Arms
|Yeah.
|-
!Pony Head
|Ugh. And, uh... Hold on, it's on the tip of my tongue. Now you're making me nervous. Uh, uh, uh... Uh...
|-
!Princess Arms
|And more bacon.
|-
!
|''Princess Arms' robot guard drops several textbooks on her desk.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|You're gonna have to take the exam.
|-
!Pony Head
|What?! I gotta take a waffle test?! That's crazy! I am not doing that, okay?! I invented brunch! [floats out of Princess Arms' office] Did y'all hear that?! Old Underarm wants me to take a test just to eat!
|-
!Rat princess
|[laughs] Yeah, Pony Head. It's so cool that you can get through brunch without passing a final, but... some of us aren't as cool as you.
|-
!Pony Head
|Well, sorry. No need to get all emotional about it.
|-
!Rat princess
|I guess, huh? What I'm saying is... [tearing up] Maybe if you don't like the way things are here now, you should just go. Come on, girls.
|-
!
|''The princesses walk away from Pony Head.''
|-
!Pony Head
|What?
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to castle courtyard. Pony Head tries to call [[Star Butterfly|Star]] on her compact mirror, but she gets the voicemail.''

![[Star Butterfly|Star]]'s voicemail
|Hey, girl! Or boy. Sorry I missed your call. Leave a message after the— [beeps]
|-
!Pony Head
|Girl, you would not believe how whack St. O's is now! They're trying to make your girl take a brunch test.
|-
!Coachman
|(''o.s.'') [screaming]
|-
!Pony Head
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''The coachman's carriage flies over the courtyard gates and crashes on top of Pony Head, causing her to go flying through a upper-level window.''
|-
!Rat princess
|Pony Head!
|-
!
|''[[Meteora Butterfly]] suddenly jumps over the gates and lands in the courtyard with a boom.''
|-
!Meteora
|[laughing evilly]
|-
!Rat princess
|Oh, no!
|-
!
|''Meteora charges forward. The rat princess goes to Princess Arms' office.''
|-
!Rat princess
|Princess Arms! Oh...!
|-
!Princess Arms
|[shaving her hairy armpits, puts her arms down] What do you want?!
|-
!Rat princess
|It's Miss Heinous! She's trying to take back the school!
|-
!Princess Arms
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''Princess Arms sounds a school-wide alarm. Some princesses are shown playing cards as the alarm goes off.
|-
!Lizard princess
|[gasps] It's Miss Heinous. Full house, girls!
|-
!
|''The card-playing princesses knock over the card table and charge to battle. A younger princess seen cooking in the kitchen drops her butcher knife, puts a collander on like a helmet, and carries a turnip into battle. The princesses storm to the front of the school, followed by the reprogrammed robot guards.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|Do not let them enter the school!
|-
!
|''Meteora and the robot guards charge toward each other.''
|-
![[Gemini]]
|Oh, milady!
|-
!
|''Gemini takes out a small remote and presses the red button on it. The robots suddenly stop charging, and their eyes turn red. They then march back toward the princesses.

!Princess Arms
|Wha— What are you doing?
|-
!
|''The robots rip out their own hearts, which start to beep.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|[gasps]
|-
!
|''The robots throw their ripped-out hearts at the princesses like bombs.''
|-
!Princesses
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''A beeping heart lands near the youngest princess, and she cries.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|Come on,  don't just stare at it!
|-
!
|''Princess Arms picks up the beeping heart and throws it at Meteora, and it explodes, engulfing Meteora in blue fire and smoke. Meteora emerges from the smoke moments later.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|Oh, no. Everyone back inside! [punches robot guard]
|-
!
|''The princesses go back inside the school and close the doors on Meteora.
|-
!Princess Arms
|Lower the pizza boxes!
|-
!
|''Princesses toss out pizza boxes from the second floor balconies and board up the doors with them.''
|-
!Young princess
|[sobbing] We're gonna die!
|-
!Princess Arms
|No, we're not.
|-
!Human princess
|Yeah, this is like a year's worth of pizza. There's no way she's getting through this.
|-
!Princess Arms
|Shh-shh-shh! Listen. I think they stopped.
|-
!
|''[[Rasticore]] suddenly gets into the school by opening a portal with his dimensional chainsaw.''

!Gemini
|[chuckles evilly]
|-
!Princess Arms
|[frees herself from the wall] All right, girls! Plan B!
|-
!
|''Meteora, Gemini, and Rasticore run down a hallway, but the princesses cut them off.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|Hold it right there! If you wanna get to the brunch room, you're gonna have to go through us!
|-
!Rasticore
|[revs up chainsaw]
|-
!Princess Ram
|[shudders]
|-
!
|''Meteora, Gemini, and Rasticore attack, and the princesses scream with terror. Scene cuts to the brunch room; Princess Arms comes in flying through the wooden door. The door then falls over next to her.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|[yelps]
|-
!
|''She sees Pony Head stuffing her face with waffles.''
|-
!Princess Arms
|Pony Head, you're alive?!
|-
!Pony Head
|[loud gulp]
|-
!Princess Arms
|What are you doing?
|-
!Pony head
|[makes a waffle, egg, and bacon sandwich] I'm brunching on your four pillars before Heinous finds me. [chomp]
|-
!Princess Arms
|[gasps] She's after ''you''?
|-
!Pony Head
|Isn't everybody?
|-
!
|''There is a loud boom and sizzling sound outside the brunch room, and Meteora, Rasticore, and Gemini walk through the blue smoke. Pony Head's horn lights up with magic power.''
|-
!Pony Head
|If I don't make it out of this, I want you to know... I hate you.
|-
!
|''Before breaching the brunch room, Meteora tears away a nearby door, and she, Gemini, and Rasticore enter a side room.''
|-
!Pony Head
|What?
|-
!
|''In another chamber, Meteora finds several robots in glass tubes and other scientific equipment. At the far back is a heap of a robot. Meteora snaps her fingers, and Gemini plugs the robot in, causing it to power on. St. Olga stands upright and pulls cobwebs off herself.''
|-
!St. Olga
|Young lady, did you unplug me?
|-
!Meteora
|Good morning, St. Olga.
|-
!St. Olga
|Oh, no. You changed your... look.
|-
!Meteora
|It's called a tail, and I think I look great with it.
|-
!St. Olga
|I think you looked better without it.
|-
!Gemini
|Well, I think she looks great with or without—
|-
!
|''Meteora covers Gemini's mouth with her tail.''
|-
!Meteora
|I need you to show me my master file.
|-
!St. Olga
|...Of course. A trip down memory lane.
|-
!
|''St. Olga starts playing a slideshow of herself and baby Meteora.''
|-
!St. Olga
|I found you when you were just a street baby. I raised you as my own out of the goodness of my heart, and I managed to find the perfect work-life balance.
|-
!Meteora
|Show me the ''real'' master file!
|-
!St. Olga
|[turns off slideshow] I do not know what you are talking about.
|-
!
|''Meteora snaps her fingers again, and Gemini presses his remote, causing St. Olga's eyes to turn red. A compartment on her back opens to reveal a computer mouse, and Gemini clicks on the mouse twice. St. Olga starts playing a new slideshow.''
|-
!Gemini
|There we go.
|-
!
|''The slideshow first shows Meteora as a young adult, strapped to a chair in the school's solitary conform-ment chamber.
|-
!Meteora (younger)
|You know, my mind's been wandering so much lately, I thought I could use a little refresher. Get me back on track.
|-
!St. Olga
|Time for a nice, relaxing brain massage.
|-
!Meteora
|No, not that memory! Rewind more! Go back!
|-
!
|''The slideshow then shows Meteora as a teenager, looking at her monster tail in the mirror.''
|-
!Meteora (teen)
|Mother, why do I have to hide my tail?
|-
!St. Olga
|You know that old rhyme, dear. "Boys do not make passes at girls with devil tails."
|-
!
|''Teenage Meteora hides her tail under her dress.''
|-
!Meteora
|No, rewind!
|-
!
|''The slideshow then shows Meteora as a child, looking at her glowing cheek marks in a puddle of water.''
|-
!Meteora (child)
|Oh, Mommy, Mommy, look! My cheeks are glowing! Isn't it pretty?
|-
!St. Olga
|Do you know what would make you even prettier?
|-
!Meteora (child)
|What, Mommy?
|-
!St. Olga
|Suppressing your flaws.
|-
!
|''St. Olga wipes young Meteora's cheeks. Present-day Meteora watches the film in silence.''
|-
!Meteora (child)
|[crying] Mommy, wait! I can fix it!
|-
!
|''Young Meteora tearfully makes her cheek marks stop glowing.''
|-
!Meteora
|Please, not this memory. Go back further.
|-
!
|''The slideshow then shows [[King Shastacan]] standing over baby Meteora's crib.''
|-
!Royal aide
|King Shastacan, the Lady St. Olga is here to see you.
|-
!King Shastacan
|Oh, St. Olga, thank you for coming.
|-
!Meteora
|This. This is it.
|-
!Shastacan
|This baby is unfit to inherit the kingdom. She's absolutely heinous.
|-
!Meteora (baby)
|[sneezes]
|-
!St. Olga
|Heinous. What a pretty name.
|-
!
|''The slideshow stops.''
|-
!Meteora
|[[Mewni]] should've been mine.
|-
!St. Olga
|I did my best raising you. All the other robot moms laughed behind my back. It was not easy. You should thank me.
|-
!Meteora
|Yeah... Thank you!
|-
!
|''Meteora punches St. Olga into the wall, deactivating her again. The arm Meteora punched St. Olga with suddenly grows in muscle mass. The princesses appear before Meteora again.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Hey! This school has become so dear to me since I got here ten minutes ago, and I did not come here to watch you destroy it!
|-
!
|''A more monstrous-looking Meteora growls at Pony Head and glares at her with yellow slitted eyes.''
|-
!Pony Head
|Ooh, you know what? You are clearly going through some things that, actually, I'm just gonna
circle back later. Wow.
|-
!
|''Meteora charges at Pony Head.''
|-
!Pony Head
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the school's front exterior. Meteora emerges from the fog holding Pony Head's broken horn and drops it on the ground. Rasticore tries to sneak past Meteora.''
|-
!Rasticore
|[muttering] I'm just gonna sneak by you...
|-
!Meteora
|Oh, Rasticore.
|-
!Rasticore
|Hmm?
|-
!Meteora
|[slowly turning her head] Looks like it's just you and me now.
|-
!Rasticore
|Yeah, about that... I really appreciate you nursing me back to health and all, but, uh... Look, y-you're great. Uh, you know that. Why am I telling you, huh? Ugh! I'm so bad at these things. I don't deserve a gal like you.
|-
!Meteora
|What...?
|-
!Rasticore
|Oh, I'm so busy with this job. I'm addicted to work! Sometimes I say to myself, "You know, Rasticore, wouldn't it be cool if you could meet Heinous, like, four years from now?"
|-
!Meteora
|It's Meteora.
|-
!Rasticore
|Yeah, yeah. See? I don't even know your name. Such a jerk. Ugh. Yeah. I gotta go. [starts walking away] But promise me this one thing: Twenty years from now, if we meet up and we're both still single, you'll be my soulmate. What am I talking about? That's not gonna happen. You're gonna find some awesome guy that's gonna steal you away from me.
|-
!
|''Meteora looks stunned. Gemini appears next to her.''
|-
!Gemini
|Looks like it's just you and me.
|-
!Meteora
|Ugh!
|-
!
|''Meteora opens Gemini's heart compartment, rips out his heart, and throws it at Rasticore, blowing up his body.''
|-
!Gemini
|Uh, if you wanted my heart, all you had to do was ask... [powering down]
|-
!
|''Rasticore, once again reduced to just an arm, tries crawling away, but Meteora steps him and picks him up.''
|-
!Meteora
|Oh, Rasticore. Time to take back the throne of Mewni.
|-
!
|''Meteora walks off into the night.''
