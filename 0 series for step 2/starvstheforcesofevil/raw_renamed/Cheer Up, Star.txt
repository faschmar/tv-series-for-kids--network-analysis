|''Episode begins on exterior shot of the [[Diaz Household]]. Magical explosions are seen behind it.''
|-
![[Marco Diaz]]
|[o.s., screaming]
|-
!
|''Cut to Marco and [[Star Butterfly|Star]] running from [[Ludo]]'s monsters.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa!
|-
!Star Butterfly
|Cupcake blast!
|-
!
|''Star fires upon the monsters with cupcake projectiles. One of the monsters cuts off the head of a coyote sculpture. Star and Marco run into a backyard shed as monsters follow.''
|-
![[Ludo]]
|[laughing] We've got them cornered!
|-
!
|''[[Ludo's army]] run toward the shed. Cut to the shed's interior. Star uses her [[Star Butterfly's wand|wand]] to brighten the shed, and Marco locks the door as the monsters try to break it down.''
|-
!Marco
|How could I have been so stupid?
|-
!
|''Marco boards up the door with buckets of paint. The monsters pound on the door. Marco retrieves a skull-shaped bust on a shelf.''
|-
!Star
|Marco, what the heck is going on?
|-
!Marco
|Uh... this may be all my fault.
|-
!Star
|What?! What did you...
|-
!
|''Star notices a three-eyed monster looking inside through the open window blinds. Star closes the blinds.''
|-
!Star
|What did you ''do''?
|-
!Marco
|Um...
|-
!
|''Marco falls off the shelf and hands the skull bust to Star.''
|-
!Marco
|Hold this. Uh, we're gonna need to build some armor.
|-
!Star
|Marco?
|-
!
|''Marco puts on a protective mask.''
|-
!Marco
|Okay. where does [[Mr. Diaz|Dad]] keep his blowtorch?
|-
!
|''The monsters outside shake the shed, and the blowtorch falls into Marco's hand.''
|-
!Marco
|Heh-heh! There it is!
|-
!Star
|Marco!
|-
!
|''Marco puts the mask down and turns the blowtorch on.''
|-
!Star
|''Marco Diaz!''
|-
!
|''Marco lifts up the mask and turns to face Star. Star drops the skull bust on the floor.''
|-
!Star
|What... is going... on?
|-
!Marco
|Look, do you remember when I was having that really bad day?
|-
!
|''Flashback to Marco trying to catch up with a moving school bus.''
|-
!Marco
|[panting] Wait! [pounding on the bus] Stop!
|-
!
|''Inside the bus, Star opens a window.''
|-
!Star
|Look at you, jogging to school. In the zone.
|-
!Marco
|[out of breath] I'm trying... to catch... the bus!
|-
!Star
|Got to keep your focus. I get it. Stay in that zone.
|-
!
|''Star closes her window. The bus comes to a stop, and Marco runs into the bus's "Stop" sign.
|-
!Marco
|Oof!
|-
!
|''He falls on the ground. The bus driver opens the door.''
|-
!Bus driver
|Who punched by bus? Who does that? Bus never did nothin' to you.
|-
!Marco
|Ow...
|-
!
|''Marco groans and sits up. The bus door closes on his hood, and the bus starts moving again, pulling him along.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa! [panting]
|-
!
|''As Marco jumps over a speed bump, his hoodie rips, and he crashes into a pile of garbage.''
|-
!Marco
|Oof! [pained groans]
|-
!
|''Marco emerges from the garbage with a black eye. A guy on a bicycle rides up next to him.''
|-
!Guy on bike
|Whoa... [laughing]
|-
!
|''The guy points at Marco's exposed shirt. The shirt depicts Marco kissing a ninja with the caption "I KISSED A NINJA AT KARATEKON 2012".''
|-
!Guy on bike
|You kissed a ninja! [laughing]
|-
!
|''Marco covers his shirt with a newspaper and runs away. The guy on the bike suddenly stops laughing and rides away off-screen. Marco runs up to the school and opens his black eye.''
|-
!Marco
|You have got to be kidding me.
|-
!
|''A sign outside [[Echo Creek Academy]] reads "PICTURE DAY!"
|-
!Marco
|School picture day?!
|-
!
|''A female student appears from off-screen with a camera.''
|-
!Student
|Smile!
|-
!
|''She takes a picture of Marco as he makes a silly face.''
|-
!Marco
|[groans] I wanna go home.
|-
!
|''[[Jeremy Birnbaum]] appears behind Marco.''
|-
!Jeremy Birnbaum
|Well, well, well. Marco Diaz.
|-
!Marco
|Not today, Jeremy.
|-
!Jeremy
|I came to give you a black eye for picture day, but apparently, there's no need.
|-
!Marco
|I said ''not today''!
|-
!
|''Marco stomps his foot down, breaking [[Jackie Lynn Thomas]]'s skateboard in half.''
|-
!Jackie
|Marco... you broke my... skateboard.
|-
!Jeremy
|Ooo-hoo-hoo!
|-
!Marco
|Jackie, I...
|-
!Jackie
|It's fine, Marco. I'll just live with it.
|-
!
|''Jackie rolls off-screen on half of her skateboard.''
|-
!Jeremy
|I think my work here is done.
|-
!
|''Cut back to Diaz Household shed – present day. Star puts the skull bust in a vise.''
|-
!Star
|I'm sorry you had a bad day, Marco, but what does that have to do with right now?
|-
!
|''Marco starts sawing the skull bust in half.''
|-
!Marco
|I'm getting to that.
|-
!
|''[[Man Arm]]'s arm crashes through the wall.''
|-
!Marco
|Whoa!
|-
!
|''Man Arm paws at the air trying to grab Star or Marco. Marco places the skull bust within Man Arm's reach. Man Arm grabs the bust and breaks off the top half.''
|-
!Marco
|Thank you!
|-
!
|''Marco boards up the hole in the wall with a painting.''
|-
!Marco
|I was so bummed out.
|-
!
|''Flashback to Marco on the living room couch looking depressed. Star appears from behind the couch wearing a large mustache.''
|-
!Marco
|(''v.o.'') But you did everything you could to cheer me up.
|-
!Star
|Huh? Huh? Huuuh?
|-
!
|''Star juggles the [[laser puppies]] and nearly drops them. Star pulls a large fish out of a hat.''
|-
!Star
|Ta-da!
|-
!
|''The fish swallows Star's head.''
|-
!Star
|[muffled scream]
|-
!
|''Star runs around the room and trips. The fish swallows her whole.''
|-
!Marco
|[laughing]
|-
!Star
|[laughing] I'm in a fish.
|-
!
|''Cut back to shed – present day.''
|-
!Marco
|And then, you met Oskar.
|-
!
|''Flashback to Echo Creek Academy hallway. Dissonant keyboard sounds fill the air.''
|-
!Nerdy kid
|[screaming]
|-
!Male student
|Make it stop! Make it stop!
|-
!Female student
|[screaming]
|-
![[Janna]]
|No, no, no, no!
|-
!
|''Star looks wide-eyed at something. She pulls [[Principal Skeeves]] in from off-screen.''
|-
!Star
|Skeeves. Who is that fresh of breath air?
|-
!
|''[[Oskar Greason]] sits on his car playing his keytar discordantly as students around him cover their ears.''
|-
!Skeeves
|Oh, that degenerate is Oskar Greason. I'd stay away if I were you. That boy has a record.
|-
!Star
|Ohhhh, a record...
|-
!
|''Star sneaks up to Oskar's car. He smiles at her as he plays. He presses a button on his keytar to produce a rhythmic percussive beat.''
|-
!Oskar
|[singing] Ah, ah, ah, ah<br />My car is a flying snail<br />Let's ride him far away, yeah<br />To mermaid pools filled with puppies' drool<br />And centaurs pulling candy sleighs<br />Ah, ah, ah, ah
|-
!Marco
|(''v.o.'') Star!
|-
!
|''Cut back to shed – present day. Marco splatters a wall with red paint.''
|-
!Marco
|Can you please keep your fantasies out of my flashback?
|-
!Star
|Almost done.
|-
!
|''Cut back to previous flashback. Star writes her number on a star-shaped sticky note and sticks it to Oskar's keytar.''
|-
!Star
|Call me. [sighs, slinks away]
|-
!
|''Cut back to shed – present day. Marco holds up a circular slide rule.''
|-
!Star
|[sighs] I couldn't wait to talk to him.
|-
!
|''Flashback to Diaz Household interior. Marco is using his cellphone. Star runs up the stairs and snatches his cellphone away.''
|-
!Star
|I'm expecting a phone call! From Oskar. [tittering]
|-
!Marco
|Why don't you just give him the home line?
|-
!Star
|Mmm, I like your ringtone better.
|-
!Ringtone
|''[[Space Unicorn|Space unicorn]], soaring through the stars''
|-
!Star
|[laughs] So cute.
|-
!Marco
|[sighs] It's supposed to be ironic.
|-
!
|''Star runs to her room with her wand in her mouth. She sits at a table, sets the phone down, and stares at it.''
|-
!Ringtone
|''Space unicorn''—
|-
!Star
|[answers] Hello?
|-
![[Grandma Diaz]]
|Hola, Marco, it's Grandma.
|-
!Star
|[hangs up, groans]
|-
!
|''Star lies on her bed waiting for Oskar's call. Scene transitions from afternoon to early evening to late evening to night. Cut back to shed – present day. Star is seen wearing the circular slide rule as a protective mask.''
|-
!Star
|I guess I'm just not cool enough for a guy with a record.
|-
!Marco
|Are you kidding? You're the coolest girl I know.
|-
!
|''Star smiles at Marco. The shed shakes violently again, and Star falls over onto the floor. Everything on the shelves crashes.''
|-
!Marco
|Anyway, you were so sad.
|-
!
|''Cut back to previous flashback. Star lies face-down on her bed while Marco looks at her from the door.''
|-
!Marco
|(''v.o.'') It was my turn to cheer you up.
|-
!
|''Marco slips away off-screen. Star's bedroom door creaks closed, and a shadow creeps toward her bed. Star looks at the shadow. A flashlight turns on, and Marco is shown wearing clown makeup.''
|-
!Marco
|Hey, Star!
|-
!Star
|[shrieks, turns on the lights]
|-
!Marco
|[quickly walks away] I thought you liked clowns! Sorry!
|-
!
|''Smash cut to next scene. Star still lies on her bed.''
|-
!Marco
|(''o.s.'') Hey, Star, up here!
|-
!
|''Star looks up. Camera pans up to the top of Star's loft. Marco sits in a shopping cart with a rocket strapped to it, wearing a sombrero with sparklers on it and a foam finger.''
|-
!Marco
|Ha-ha, watch this. I'm gonna... [stammers] I can't do this.
|-
!
|''Before Marco can get out of the cart, it takes off.''
|-
!Marco
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''Star watches in shock as fireworks light up the room and Marco screams off-screen. Star [[Star Butterfly's sword|sword]] sticks into the floor. Marco rides a rush of water down a flight of circular steps and slides next to Star's bed. He spits a lit sparkler out of his mouth.''
|-
!Marco
|Ta-da!
|-
!Star
|Ugh!
|-
!
|''Marco stands up and finds Star's wand on the table.''
|-
!Marco
|(''v.o.'') And that's when I realized – nothing makes you happier than when you're Narwhal Blasting a monster.
|-
!
|''Marco ties the wand to the end of a fishing line and opens a portal with Star's [[dimensional scissors]]. On the other side of the portal, Ludo's [[Unnamed two headed monster|two-headed minion]] is seen sweeping up skulls and bones.''
|-
!Marco
|(''v.o.'') So I tried to lure one with your wand.
|-
!
|''Marco tosses the wand next to the monster's feet.
|-
!Two-headed minion
|Hmm? Hey!
|-
!
|''As he bends down to pick up the wand, Marco reels it in. The monster chases after it and follows it through the portal.''
|-
!Marco
|[sing-songy] Oh, Star!
|-
!
|''More monsters suddenly appear. Cut back to shed – present.''
|-
!Star
|So you brought these monsters here to cheer me up?
|-
!Marco
|Yeah... I just didn't expect so many. [chuckles]
|-
!
|''Marco puts a bucket on Star's head.
|-
!Marco
|But don't worry. This armor will hold them off.
|-
!
|''Marco and Star are dressed in crudely-made battle armor. The shed's roof is suddenly ripped away, and Man Arm's arm reaches inside to grab Marco.''
|-
!Star
|Marco!
|-
!Marco
|[screaming]
|-
!
|''Man Arm holds Marco in one hand while Ludo and his army surround him.''
|-
!Ludo
|Give it up, Star Butterfly! You're outmatched!
|-
!Star
|Ludo, what's with all these new monsters?
|-
!Ludo
|What? These are all the same monsters I always bring.
|-
!Star
|Mmm, I don't know.
|-
!Marco
|[pointing at Man Arm] I've never seen this dude in my life.
|-
!Ludo
|You mean you've never met Man Arm?
|-
!
|''Man Arm turns to the left to reveal his human-like left arm.''
|-
!Man Arm
|Hey.
|-
!Ludo
|Surely you know [[Spikeballs]].
|-
!Spikeballs
|Well, we were never formally introduced.
|-
!
|''Spikeballs walks up to Marco and shakes his hand.''
|-
!Spikeballs
|Hi, I'm Spikeballs. I'm usually in the back.
|-
!Ludo
|[sighs] Now that you all know each other... [chuckles] Get the wand!
|-
!
|''Ludo's monsters charge in to attack. Star blasts Man Arm with Rainbow Fist Punch, causing him to drop Marco. Star and Marco team up against the monsters. Star jumps high into the air.''
|-
!Star
|Honeybee Tornado Swarm!
|-
!
|''Star swarms the monsters with bees and pollen. Most of the monsters get covered in bee stings, but a [[Unnamed flower monster|flower monster]] appears to enjoy it.''
|-
!Star
|You were right, Marco! I'm totally cheered up! [blasts [[Big Chicken]]] I don't even care if Oskar calls!
|-
!Ringtone
|''Space unicorn, soaring through the stars<br />Delivering the rainbows all around the world...''
|-
!Ludo
|Ugh, what is that terrible ringtone?
|-
!Marco
|It's supposed to be ironic!
|-
!Star
|[looks at phone, gasps] It's Oskar!
|-
!Marco
|[in a headlock] Well, talk to him.
|-
!Star
|Oh, right-right-right-right-right! [answers] Hello?
|-
!Oskar
|Hi, I'm calling this phone number on my phone?
|-
!Star
|Thank you for calling. No, I mean—Hiiii.
|-
!Oskar
|Hi.
|-
!Star and Oskar
|So what are you...
|-
!Star
|Oh, I-I-I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
|-
!
|''[[Bearicorn]] roars loudly in Star's ear. She slowly turns to him, appalled.''
|-
!Star
|Ugh! [to Oskar] Oskar, can you hold on for, like, one second? [to monsters, enraged] ''Hey! I am on the phone! You monsters are so rude!''
|-
!
|''Ludo's monsters look surprised.''
|-
!Star
|Syrup Tsunami Shockwave!
|-
!
|''Star washes the monsters away with a tidal wave of waffles, pancakes, and maple syrup.''
|-
!Ludo's army
|[screaming]
|-
!Star
|[sighs, to Oskar] Sorry about that. [giggles] Cool.
|-
!Oskar
|Cool.
|-
!Star
|Cool.
|-
!Star
|...Okay, bye. I like your phone voice. [hangs up, sighs]
|-
!
|''The two-headed minion is seen stuck to the ground. A crocodile minion is stuck to a cactus. A giraffe minion's head is stuck to his own back.''
|-
!Two-headed minion
|[grunts] Sticky. All sticky.
|-
!Star
|Mmm, thanks, Marco. You did know just how to cheer me up. And Oskar called anyway! [giggles] Hugs!
|-
!
|''Star hugs Marco and gets stuck to him because of the maple syrup.''
|-
!Star
|Blecch.
|-
!
|''The bicycle guy from earlier rides up next to them.''
|-
!Guy on bike
|Whoa... [laughing]
|-
!
|''He suddenly stops laughing and rides away. Marco and Star look to the camera confused.''
