|''Episode begins in [[Queen Butterfly]]'s office at [[Butterfly Castle]]. She levitates [[Star Butterfly|Star]] out of the office as in "[[The Bogbeast of Boggabah]]".''
|-
![[Star Butterfly]]
|How could you do this to your precious baby girl?!
|-
![[Queen Butterfly|Queen Moon]]
|You're not a baby, so stop acting like one! [slams door, groans] Trying... [sits in her chair] Trial ready... and she doesn't think... Whew. Baloo-balee, baloo-balow. I let you go, I let you go. [eats [[Cornritos]]] I don't even know my own family...
|-
!
|''Moon looks over at the large book labeled "[[Butterfly family|BUTTERFLY FAMILY]]".''
|-
!Moon
|[groans] Fine.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to [[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]'s room, where loud rock music is playing. Moon opens the door.''
|-
!Moon
|Eclipsa? I—
|-
!
|''Eclipsa is playing thrash music on a skeleton guitar.''
|-
![[Eclipsa Butterfly|Eclipsa]]
|[gasps] Oh, hey. Queen Moon. Hi. You're in my room.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa puts the guitar down, and a winged rat-like creature next to her floats away in fright.''
|-
!Moon
|Did you... make a... guitar... out of a skeleton?
|-
!Eclipsa
|I work with what I'm given.
|-
!Moon
|This should be quick. Star just stormed into my office with some crazy idea about who your daughter is.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Okay.
|- 
!Moon
|[opens "BUTTERFLY FAMILY" book] Look, I just need you to identify her from a picture. Can you do that?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Hm.
|-
!Moon
|What is it?
|-
!Eclipsa
|It's just... I haven't seen my daughter in three hundred years.
|-
!Moon
|Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have—
|-
!Eclipsa
|No, it's fine. I'm fine.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa turns the book to [[Festivia Butterfly|Festivia the Fun]]'s page.''
|-
!Moon
|Is this your daughter?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Festivia? No.
|-
!Moon
|What? Are you sure?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, I'm sure. [sits by the window] My daughter was [[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]].
|-
!Moon
|Well, the name may have been changed.
|-
!Eclipsa
|But that's not her. My daughter had pretty little clovers on her cheeks and the cutest tail in all of Mewni.
|-
!Moon
|I-I'm sorry. A tail?
|-
!Eclipsa
|She got it from her daddy.
|-
!Moon
|But how is that possible?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, when a queen and a monster love each other very much—
|-
!Moon
|I mean, how could this not be your daughter? This is the complete history of the Butterfly family! If this isn't your daughter, then who is she?
|-
!Eclipsa
|I wish I could tell you. The Royal Archive would have the truth.
|-
!Moon
|The Archive? In the Bureaucracy of Magic? Where they keep lunch receipts and office supplies?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Don't judge a room by its supplies. The Archive has the real history, beyond what's in your book.
|-
!Moon
|Well, I don't have access to the Archive. Don't even know how to get there.
|-
!Eclipsa
|I could come with you.
|-
!Moon
|No, no, no. That, uh, won't be possible. I'd never hear the end of it if I took you out of here.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, good luck.
|-
!
|''Moon starts to leave the room.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|If you find out what happened, please let me know. I had a daughter. I'd like to know what happened to her.
|-
!Moon
|[sighs] Fine. Let's go. I can't believe I'm doing this.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, think of it as a girls' night if that makes you feel better.
|-
!Moon
|It doesn't.
|-
!
|''Scene cuts to the Bureaucracy of Magic lobby. Sean the security guard puts cupcakes on a tray and gets his hoof covered in frosting.''
|-
!Sean
|[scoffs] Sean, you little pig. You made a mess. Who's gonna clean this up? Ahhh... [licks frosting off his hoof]
|-
!Moon
|(''o.s.'') Hello, Sean!
|-
!Sean
|Huh?
|-
!
|''Moon enters the Bureaucracy of Magic with Eclipsa hidden under her gown.''
|-
!Sean
|(''o.s.'') Queen Moon!
|-
!Moon
|Just, uh, just grabbing something from my office, like a normal person.
|-
!
|''Moon crosses the magic detection device, causing it to go off.''
|-
!Sean
|Sorry, Queen Moon. Looks like I'll have to scan ya.
|-
!Moon
|[threateningly] Yeah, that's a great idea, Sean. Why don't you scan me?
|-
!Sean
|Uh... No, it's... I don't need to. Uh... it's probably fine.
|-
!
|''Moon hurries deeper into the building and hides behind a corner.''
|-
!Moon
|[quavering] I can't believe I'm doing this. What am I doing? 
|-
!
|''Eclipsa pops out from under Moon's gown.''
|-
!Moon
|Get out of there! Now, where's the Archive?
|-
!Eclipsa
|I dunno.
|-
!Moon
|You said you knew where you were going!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Last time I was here, the Archive was just a stone cottage.
|-
!Moon
|Wait. Did you say stone?
|-
!
|''Moon opens a supply closet with a coat rack and various objects.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh. It's a coat closet.
|-
!Moon
|Don't judge a room by its supplies.
|-
!
|''Moon pushes the coats aside to reveal a stone wall.''
|-
!Moon
|Ta-da.
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, would you look at that? Let's see if I remember... [presses musical stone panels] Duh... duh... Mmm... Duh-duh-duh-duh-buh-bah!
|-
!
|''The stone wall opens to reveal a secret passageway.''
|-
!Moon
|Aren't you just full of secrets?
|-
!
|''Sean enters the closet with a tray of empty cupcake cups and frosting all over his mouth.''
|-
!Sean
|Did it again, Sean. Is that how you want to live your life? Those cupcakes weren't even for you! [throws tray in the trash] Oh. Hey, Queen Moon.
|-
!Moon
|Sean!
|-
!Sean
|I... see you brought, um... you brought a friend. And you opened a secret door.
|-
!Moon
|It's not—! What are you doing?
|-
!Sean
|[holding his radio] I think I gotta report this, don't I?
|-
!Moon
|Put that down, Sean. Right now!
|-
!Sean
|I'm... sorry, I can't do that.
|-
!
|''Moon grabs Sean's radio away and rips the cord.''
|-
!Moon
|[chuckles nervously]
|-
!Sean
|[worried moan]
|-
!
|''Sean runs to the closet door, but Moon cuts him off.''
|-
!Moon
|No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait! Look, the other members of the [[Magic High Commission|High Commission]] – they won't understand!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Why don't you wipe his memory?
|-
!Moon and Sean
|What?!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Use your magic. You know, just point and say "Mind Eraser!" Pew-pew!
|-
!Sean
|What?! You can't do that!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, of course she can. She's magic.
|-
!Moon
|I am not wiping his memory, Eclipsa!
|-
!Sean
|Eclipsa?!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Well, I can't do it. I never learned magic without a wand.
|-
!Sean
|Yeah, please don't.
|-
!Moon
|Is this how you used magic? When there's a problem, you just "Mind Eraser, pew-pew"?
|-
!
|''Moon accidentally wipes Sean's memory, leaving in a vegetative state on the floor.''
|-
!Sean
|[groans]
|-
!Moon
|[gasps] What have I done?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, come on. You did that on purpose.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa pushes Sean out of the closet, and he falls onto the floor. Scene cuts to interior of the secret passageway.''
|-
!Moon
|I can't believe I'm doing this. I must be crazy!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Let's see... [singing] Dark is the hall beyond the pitch, oh, where could there be light?
|-
!Moon
|What are you doing?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Oh, just singing a little song I wrote to help me remember my way.
|-
!Moon
|Wait, Eclipsa, don't run!
|-
!Eclipsa
|♪ Dark is the hall beyond the pitch ♪
|-
!
|''Eclipsa and Moon hop over a small hole.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|♪ Oh, where could there be light? ♪
|-
!
|''Eclipsa uses a compact mirror to reflect a beam of light at a door, unlocking it.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|It's this way.<br />♪ Not up nor down but three steps round ♪
|-
!
|''Eclipsa runs faster through the passageway.''
|-
!Moon
|Hey, slow down!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Two doors down!
|-
!
|''Moon and Eclipsa reach a statue of a man holding a torch.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|♪ Her torch shall steer you right ♪<br />[sighs] Ta-da!
|-
!
|''Moon and Eclipsa turn to face a large eyeball-shaped door.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[jiggles doorknob] Locked. Hmm. Have you got a hairpin?
|-
!
|''Moon gives Eclipsa a hairpin, and she tucks it into her hair.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|That's better. Okay, right. So we're going to use the rat hole.
|-
!Moon
|What rat hole?
|-
!
|''Eclipsa pushes a nearby rock aside to reveal a small hole in the wall.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Rat hole.
|-
!Moon
|I am not getting in a rat hole!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[giggles] It's so dirty in here!
|-
!Moon
|Isn't there– Isn't there another way?
|-
!
|''Moon tries crawling through the rat hole and gets stuck.''
|-
!Moon
|[groans] Oh, I think I'm stuck!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Yeah, I think so, too. Looks like your gown is stuck. I'll have to go around to pull you through, okay?
|-
!Moon
|How long will it be before you're on the other side?
|-
!Eclipsa
|Not long at all. No worries!
|-
!
|''Moon looks up at a chandelier of lit candles. A three-eyed spider appears and looks at Moon. It lowers down to her eye level on a string of web and looks at her crown. It starts swinging back and forth. Moon follows the spider's movements, and her eyes start to close.''
|-
!Moon
|What are you... doing...?
|-
!
|''Moon falls asleep. When she wakes up, the spider is dancing with her crown.
|-
!Moon
|[gasps] Hey, drop that!
|-
!
|''The spider runs away with Moon's crown.''
|-
!Moon
|How long have I been out?
|-
!
|''The candles on the chandelier have completely burned out.''
|-
!Moon
|Oh, no. Eclipsa! Eclipsa? Hello?! [sighs] I trusted her! I can't believe I trusted her!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa appears through the eye-shaped door.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|[kicks Moon's leg] Knock, knock!
|-
!Moon
|What took you so long?!
|-
!Eclipsa
|I came as fast as I could! Are you okay?
|-
!Moon
|Yes, I'm fine. I just needed a little— Agh!
|-
!
|''Eclipsa pulls Moon out of the rat hole, and they enter the Royal Archive.''
|-
!Moon
|It's... It's incredible!
|-
!
|''A giant clock with wings controls dozens of automatons writing on scrolls with quills.''
|-
!Moon
|I had no idea this was here.
|-
!Eclipsa
|No, no, no! Watch your step.
|-
!
|''Moon stops before stepping on a booby-trapped floor tile.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|You'll set off the alarm. I haven't seen these little guys in forever. [waves to automatons] Hello! They've been recording everything that's ever happened to the royal family.
|-
!Moon
|[reading] "7:59, [[King Butterfly|King River]] reveals Star to be the Bogbeast of Boggabah"? What? You know, this stuff would've made it a lot easier to build a case against you! Sorry.
|-
!Eclipsa
|There's so much stuff here, it's impossible to find anything. Unless you know where to look.
|-
!
|''In a large room of shelves with scrolls, Eclipsa climbs a tall ladder.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Of course, I know where my scroll is.
|-
!
|''As Moon climbs the ladder, it suddenly rolls to the left.''
|-
!Moon
|Aah!
|-
!Eclipsa
|[rifling through scrolls] Ah, here it is! [pulls out her scroll, reads] "And so the daughter of Eclipsa and [[King Shastacan]], Princess Festivia, was crowned queen upon her mother's imprisonment." They took her out. They erased all record of my daughter completely. Who's Festivia?
|-
!Moon
|Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this.
|-
!
|''Eclipsa jumps to the bottom of the ladder, and Moon falls flat on the floor.''
|-
!Moon
|Oof! [stands up and dusts herself off] Once we're back at the palace, we can put—
|-
!
|''Moon steps on a booby-trapped floor tile.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|I told you to watch your step!
|-
!
|''The alarm sounds, and the automatons throw their quills at Moon and Eclipsa.''
|-
!Eclipsa
|Run! Run!
|-
!Moon
|It's not the easiest thing in this dress!
|-
!
|''The three-eyed spider dancing with Moon's crown sees Moon and Eclipsa running and notices the scroll in Moon's hands.''
|-
!Spider
|Ooh!
|-
!
|''As Moon and Eclipsa dodge flying quills, the eye-shaped door starts to close.''
|-
!Moon
|Oh, dear!
|-
!
|''The spider suddenly swings into Moon and knocks the crown and scroll to the floor.''
|-
!Moon
|[grunts, picks up scroll] You incorrigible—!
|-
!Eclipsa
|Moon, hurry!
|-
!
|''Moon jumps through the closing door gap and uses the spider and its web like a lasso to retrieve her crown.
|-
!Moon and Eclipsa
|[panting]
|-
!
|''Moon and Eclipsa duck behind a corner as [[Omnitraxus Prime]], [[Hekapoo]], and [[Rhombulus]] run toward the Royal Archive, and they safely make their escape. Scene cuts back to Butterfly Castle.''
|-
!Moon
|All right, so it's clear someone's orchestrated a cover-up. And I think I know who it was.
|-
!Eclipsa
|They erased my daughter. ''I'm'' the one on trial.
|-
!Moon
|Eclipsa, I believe your daughter may still be alive.
|-
!Eclipsa
|What? But how?
|-
!
|''There's a knock at the door. Star enters covered in mud.''
|-
!Star
|Hey.
|-
!Moon and Eclipsa
|Hey.
