''(Above the water, [[Nya]] battles [[Wojira]] and [[Kalmaar]] fiercely. Under the surface, [[Jay]]'s damaged [[Sub car|car]] is leaking.)''

'''Jay''': Uh, teensy problem, guys. I've got a bad leak and no control. [[Lloyd]]? [[Zane]]? Anyone? ''(He notices his car leaking quickly.)'' Okay. Okay. Looks like we're going for a swim. Eject! ''(He pushes a button but it doesn't respond.)'' Oh come on, why won't you eject! Oh, not good. Think! What would Zane do? Actually, no. Think, what would [[Kai]] do. ''(He tries to break the glass.)'' Come on ...

''(On the [[Destiny's Bounty]], [[Wu]] and [[P.I.X.A.L.]] are speeding away from Wojira.)''

'''Wu''': Everyone, listen up! Nya's not going to hold off Wojira for much longer. We need to regroup!

''(The ninja comply, but are surrounded by [[Merlopians]].)''

'''Lloyd''': Any suggestions, Zane? What's our best course of action?

'''Zane''': I have run three million simulations, and the outcome of all of them is the same. We will lose.

'''Kai''': Ninja never quit!

'''Wu''': No, but a wise ninja knows when to retreat, and now is that time. Everyone, fall back.

'''[[Gripe]]''': Fire!

'''Kai''': You heard Master Wu. Let's get out of here!

'''Wu''': P.I.X.A.L., we have to get these people to safety.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Kalmaar is unlikely to allow us to retreat, and at this speed, we have little chance of outrunning him.

'''Wu''': Hmm. ''(He sees the [[NGTV]] building.)'' There! Set course for that building and turn on the autopilot. I have an idea.

''(Above the water, Nya continues to fight Kalmaar and Wojira. She is blasted and nearly falls off.)''

'''Nya''': This -- isn't over, Kalmaar! I'll be back! ''(She leaps off and escapes by jumping on [[Water]].)''

'''Kalmaar''': Ugh, don't let her get away. After her! After her!

''(Under the surface, Jay's car is completely filled with water. As he kicks at the door, [[Benthomaar]] and [[Cole]] arrive.)''

'''Cole''': Let's get him out of here.

'''Benthomaar''': ''(He opens the door and carries Jay to the surface.)'' Hang on!

''(Out at sea, Kalmaar spots the Bounty.)''

'''Kalmaar''': There! The cowards are retreating! Destroy the ship! Sink that vessel! ''(He leaps on board to find it empty.)'' It's on autopilot. ''(He strikes the screen.)'' Find them. Find the ninja!

''(On the NGTV building, Benthomaar emerges with Jay, followed by the others.)''

'''Nya''': ''(She gasps.)'' What happened?

'''Cole''': He's hurt. He inhaled a bunch of water.

'''Wu''': Get him inside, quickly! And hide those [[Mini submarines|vehicles]]!

'''Kalmaar''': Nya! I will find you. There's no way you can hide! This world is no longer yours. It's mine!

''(In the building, Jay struggles to breathe.)''

'''Kai''': How is he?

'''Zane''': Jay has a significant amount of sea water in his lungs. Unless the water is removed, his condition will worsen.

'''Kai''': Uh, what about Nya? Maybe she can draw out the water.

'''Wu''': She has tried. The water in his lungs does not respond to her.

'''Lloyd''': We need to get him to a hospital!

'''Kai''': How are we gonna move him with that thing out there hunting us?

'''Cole''': Maybe we can get help? From Princess Vania or somebody.

'''Zane''': Our communicators do not have that range.

'''Nya''': Bentho, how did [[Nyad]] defeat Wojira? In the story you told me.

'''Benthomaar''': She became one with the [[Endless Sea|sea]].

'''Nya''': But how exactly?

'''Benthomaar''': She opened herself up to the full power of the ocean. She merged with it. ''(Nya gazes at the sea outside.)'' Do not think of such things. Nyad may have defeated Wojira, but she lost herself. What she did ... could not be undone. She vanished.

''(She looks grimly at the sea. On a different building, Gripe bangs open a door and startles Kalmaar, causing his crown to fall off.)''

'''Gripe''': My Lord! Still no sign of the ninja.

'''Kalmaar''': They are here. Keep searching! Search every one of these buildings if you must.

'''Gripe''': Yes, my Lord! In the meantime, we have found someone who claims to know them.

'''Kalmaar''': What? Who?

'''Gripe''': He refuses to speak, but we found this in his possession. ''(He holds up a photo of the [[Police Commissioner]] and the ninja.)''

'''Kalmaar''': Take me to him. At once.

''(The sun rises. In the NGTV building, Nya wakes up. She sees that everyone else is still asleep.)''

'''Nya''': I wish we had more time, but we never seem to get a break. ''(She kisses Jay on the cheek, which wakes him, and quietly exits the room. On the roof, she turns to look back at the door. With a sad smile and tears rolling down her cheeks, she mouths "I love you." and dives into the sea. Underwater, she does Spinjitzu as her eyes start glowing. The water in Jay's lungs are drawn out, and he lets out a gasp, waking everyone else.)''

'''Wu''': Jay?

'''Lloyd''': What's happening?

'''Zane''': The water in his lungs is being drawn out!

'''Cole''': How?

''(A bright glow causes them to look outside.)''

'''Benthomaar''': No!

'''Wu''': What is she doing?

'''Benthomaar''': She's attempting to merge with the sea. But it is something that can never be undone! She will be lost forever!

'''Wu''': ''(He gasps.)'' We must stop her! ''(Everyone but Jay runs out of the room.)''

'''Jay''': What? ''(He looks up to see Nya completing her transformation.)'' Nya? ''(Nya swims to his window and they share a smile. Far away, Wojira roars, and Nya blasts off to face her.)'' Nya, wait! ''(The force blasts Jay away from the window.)'' Whoa!

'''Wu''': Nya. Nya! Come back!

'''Benthomaar''': She did it.

'''Jay''': She's going after Kalmaar. She's going to finish it. And I'm gonna help her.

'''Wu''': Jay, you can barely stand.

'''Jay''': I'm going.

'''Wu''': Very well. We will all go.

''(Kalmaar arrives at the [[Ninjago City Police Station|police station]], where the Commissioner and [[Jimmy]] are cornered.)''

'''Kalmaar''': Who are you?

'''Commissioner''': I'm the police commissioner.

'''Kalmaar''': Commissioner?

'''Gripe''': I believe it is a potentate of some kind. Like a king.

'''Commissioner''': I'm a law officer. It's my job to protect the people and property of this [[Ninjago City|city]].

'''Kalmaar''': Then I would say you have done a poor job. Where are the ninja? Tell me, and I will show you mercy.

'''Commissioner''': Even if I knew, I'd never tell you.

'''Kalmaar''': I will ask one last time. Where are the ninja? ''(The Commissioner shakes his head. Suddenly, Wojira's eyes glow and she slithers up the building. Kalmaar and the Merlopians run to the roof to see a blue glow speeding towards them.)''

'''Gripe''': What is it?

'''Kalmaar''': It's her! The girl!

'''Nya''': My name isn't "girl". It's Nya. And you're going to wish you never crossed me! ''(She leaps at Kalmaar angrily.)''
