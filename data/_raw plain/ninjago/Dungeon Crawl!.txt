''(In a flashback, [[Lou]] takes a young [[Cole]] to visit [[Lilly]].)''

'''Past Lilly''': ''(coughs)'' Hi, honey.

'''Past Cole''': Mom! ''(He runs to her and hugs her.)'' I don't want you to be sick anymore, Mom!

'''Past Lilly''': I know. But we don't always get what we want, do we? Your father said you got into trouble at school.

'''Past Cole''': Yeah. But it - it wasn't my fault! There's this kid, he's just - he's just a big bully! He's always picking on the little kids and -

'''Past Lilly''': And you got in a fight.

'''Past Cole''': I'm sorry, Mom. I promise, I-I won't fight anymore. I'll be good from now on. I'll make you proud! And - and -

'''Past Lilly''': Oh, Cole. Don't you see? I ''am'' proud. I want you to promise me, Cole, that you will always stand up to those who are cruel and unjust. Always.

'''Past Cole''': I - I promise, Mom. Always.

''(The flashback ends.)''

'''[[Plundar]]''': What are we doing? We've explored this tunnel a million times. If there was a way out of [[Rock-Bottom]], we would have found it already.

'''[[Fungus]]''': Come now, Plundar. It doesn't hurt to have someone take a fresh look.

'''Plundar''': It's hurting my feet! We've been at this for hours.

'''[[Vania]]''': Are we having a [[tea]] time chat, or are we trying to escape this [[Dungeons of Shintaro|dungeon]]? ''(She catches up to Cole.)'' Another dead end?

'''Cole''': Another dead end.

'''Fungus''': Good sir [[ninja]], if it makes you feel any better, the four of us have been failing to escape this place for years.

'''Cole''': Well, thank you, but that doesn't really help.

'''Plundar''': ''(sighs)'' What are we doing following this guy? This is a waste of time. We're already a bunch of failed adventurers. We don't need a leader to help us fail more.

'''Vania''': Cole isn't helping us fail! He's helping us escape! For your information, Cole is a fantastic leader!

'''Plundar''': Oh yeah? Where's he leading us? In circles? Because guess where we are. That's right, back in Rock-Bottom.

''(Cole throws a rock into the pool in frustration.)''

'''[[Wu]]''': What is on your mind, Cole? You seem troubled.

'''Cole''': Ever since I saw my mother's [[Lilly's necklace|locket]], I felt her presence. She's connected to this place somehow, I - I can feel it! ''(sighs)'' Listen to me, what am I talking about? Why would my mother have come to this place? We're at the bottom of the world.

'''Wu''': You're right. This is the lowest you have ever been.

'''Cole''': Thanks for noticing.

'''Wu''': No, I mean, your mother once told me that her powers were strongest when she was closest to the earth.

'''Cole''': Really?

'''Wu''': You've never been farther underground. Never been more surrounded by the very thing that powers you. The [[Skull Sorcerer]] thought he was burying you, but what if he was actually bringing you closer to the earth? To the source of your [[Earth|elemental power]]?

'''Cole''': So what do I do? Try to connect with the earth?

'''Wu''': Perhaps. Or perhaps you just have to stop worrying so much and let the earth connect with you!

'''Cole''': ''(He nods, closes his eyes, and concentrates.)'' I'm not feeling anything. ''(He starts glowing orange.)''

'''Wu''': Cole. Open your eyes.

'''Cole''': Whoa. ''(The rocks around him glow orange and float. He starts floating, too.)''

'''Wu''': Let it in. Let the energy of the earth infuse you!

'''Cole''': I feel it. It's coming from the ground all around me! ''(He punches the ground, and an orange streak leading into the pool appears.)'' There's a tunnel down there. Maybe a way out!

'''Fungus''': We're with you.

'''Plundar''': Fine.

''(They dive into the pool and swim through a tunnel. Vania screams when she sees a skull, and Cole gives her a boost up. Wu's cape gets stuck, and Cole frees him.)''

'''Vania''': Where's Cole? And Master Wu?

'''Wu''': ''(He and Cole emerge.)'' You - you saved my life.

'''Cole''': Nothing you haven't done for me a thousand times. Is everyone okay?

'''Vania''': But which tunnel do we take?

'''Wu''': Cole, touch the ground again. ''(Cole does so, revealing the correct path.)''

'''Plundar''': Across the lava? Ugh, what am I saying? Of course across the lava. All these nice tunnels we could take, but no. We got to take the tunnel on the other side of the lava.

'''Cole''': You think I'm any happier about it? But that's the way. I feel it.

'''[[Korgran]]''': Ah, Korgran fears no lava. ''(He dips a mug into the lava.)'' Korgran drinks lava for breakfast.

'''Plundar''': No you don't. You drink juice.

'''Korgran''': What? ''(The mug burns up.)'' Oh, right. Juice! Korgran fears no juice! Lava, on other hand ... very scary.

'''Cole''': Is the path filled with danger? Yes. Would it be easier to turn back? Of course. But we can't stop [[Skull Sorcerer]] and save our friends trapped down here, can we?

'''Plundar''': We can't stop him if we're dead either.

'''Cole''': Then I guess you better roll your dice and take a chance. What's it gonna be? Turn back, or keep going?

'''Plundar''': Ah. ''(They begin crossing the lava.)'' Almost there.

'''Cole''': Wait. I sense danger.

'''Plundar''': What are you talking about? We're practically home free.

'''Cole''': No, I - I sense tremors in the ground beneath us. I've never felt anything like this! ''(A lava monster emerges and roars.)''

'''Fungus''': Never seen anything like that!

'''Cole''': Look out! Team, listen up! Korgran, frontal assault. Keep it focused, look out for those tentacles.

'''Korgran''': Tentacles should look out for Korgran! ''(He cuts some of the lava monster's tentacles off, but they grow right back.)''

'''Cole''': Master Wu, block those lava balls, and send them right back at him!

'''Vania''': Look out, more lava flying at us! ''(Wu does [[Spinjitzu]] and redirects the lava ball.)'' Two more to the left! ''(Wu sends the lava back at the monster.)''

'''Cole''': Fungus, see if you can distract him with some more of those snow flurries!

'''Fungus''': I will endeavor to do more than just distract him!

'''Cole''': Plundar, see if you can sneak around and reach that boulder! It just needs a little nudge!

'''Plundar''': Ah, that's a job for [[Adam]]. Get it, Adam! Get it!

''(Fungus freezes the lava monster just before it crushes Plundar.)''

'''Cole''': Adam! Now! ''(The boulder crushes and defeats the lava monster.)'' Everybody all right?

'''Wu''': Yes.

'''Vania''': I'm okay.

'''Fungus''': Doing well, sir ninja.

'''Plundar''': I've been better.

'''Korgran''': Korgran still alive.

'''Plundar''': Good job, Adam! Good boy!

'''Cole''': Yeah, not bad for a bunch of failed adventurers! ''(They leave through a tunnel.)'' Hang on. I'm gonna seal this passage. Just in case that lava monster decides to come back. ''(He uses his [[Earth Punch]] to seal it.)''

'''Plundar''': Hey, hold up. I need to say something to you. I was wrong about you. You've been straight with us. You got us out of there, and, well, you're okay in my book.

'''Cole''': Thanks, guys. But let's not start getting all huggy yet. We got a long way to go.

'''Fungus''': For the first time in a long while, I believe we have a chance. Lead on, young ninja!

'''Vania''': Phew. Let's hope it's downhill from here. I mean, I know it's uphill, but you know, downhill uphill. That would be nice.

'''Plundar''': Yep, I'm willing to bet the worst is behind us.
