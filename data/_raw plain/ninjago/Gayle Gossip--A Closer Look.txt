(At [[Ninjago City]], [[Gayle Gossip]] reports about the ''[[Prime Empire]]'' trend.)

'''Gayle Gossip''': There's a new trend sweeping in Ninjago City, and it's called ''Prime Empire''. It's a video game that popped up seemingly from nowhere, but if you scratch the surface, something strange is going on. And I'm gonna get... a closer look.

----

''(An old commercial of Prime Empire starts playing.)''

'''Commercial Narration''': ''(At an arcade, two kids get bored after playing two of the video games.)'' Bored of the same old tired games? Think there's nothing new? Well, think again. ''(Smoke appears out of no where and the two kids see an Arcade Pod that features the Prime Empire video game. The game then shows a person traveling across Prime Empire while fighting of [[Sushimi]] and [[Red Visors]].)'' ''Prime Empire'' is a gaming experience like no other. Giving you eight whole bits of graphics! From the [[Temple of Madness]], to the [[Forest of Discontent]], to the futuristic [[Terra Technica]]. You'll never experience anything like ''Prime Empire''. Coming to an arcade near you.

----

'''Gayle Gossip''': The commercial never aired of course. ''Prime Empire'' was shelved for reasons that are still unclear. What happened? Why did [[Vast Industries]] shut the game down? The game's programmer, [[Milton Dyer]], was a legend in the gaming industry, cranking out [[Turbo Street Brawler|hit]] after [[Counter|hit]] after [[Conic the Ratboy|hit]]. Perhaps the reason has something to do with an undisclosed incident that occurred in Vast Industries on the eve of the game's release. Dyer certainly isn't talking. He's been in hiding ever since. Is he behind the [[Would You Like to Enter Prime Empire?|sudden reemergence]] of the game? And if so, why now?

''(At [[Benny's Arcade Emporium]], Gayle interviews [[Nelson]].)''

'''Gayle Gossip''': What do you think of ''Prime Empire''?

'''Nelson''': Greatest! Game! Ever! Even my [[Roise|mom]] likes it. She's been playing it nonstop. I h-haven't seen her in a while, but I'm sure she's around here somewhere.

'''[[Benny]]''': This game is amazing. I've never seen an arcade this popular. ''(He points to the line behind him.)'' We've got lines around the block, but come on down, we'll make room, everyone gets a turn at Benny's Arcade Emporium!

'''[[Zane]]''': ''(He interrupts Benny to speak to Gayle.)'' That would be unwise. We have reasons to believe that these games are potentially hazardous, and advising all toâ€” ''(He gets interrupted by Benny.)''

'''Benny''': Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, mister. I wasn't quite done. ''(To Gayle.)'' So come on down to Benny's Arcade Emporium, where fun is number one! ''(Laughs awkwardly.)''

'''Gayle Gossip''': I suspect there's some deeper truth being covered up, but what? Let's go straight to the source, ''Prime Empire'', itself.

----

''(Inside the arcade, Gayle Gossip continues her report behind Nelson while the latter plays Prime Empire.)''

'''Gayle Gossip''': Sure, it's all fun and games now, but how long until these players discover ''Prime Empire''<nowiki/>'s dark side?

''(Behind Gayle Gossip, Nelson reaches Level 13 of Prime Empire.)''

'''Game Voice''': Would you like to enter ''Prime Empire''?

'''Nelson''': You bet I would. I love this game!

'''Gayle Gossip''': ''(A flash of light appears behind her.)'' Until we know more, this reporter urges caution and forethought. I'm Gayle Gossip and this has been... a closer look.
