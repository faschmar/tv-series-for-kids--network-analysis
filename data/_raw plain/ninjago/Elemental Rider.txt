''([[Kai]] and [[Zane]] walk around the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu|Monastery]].)''

'''Kai''': Hey, Master. What's up?

'''Wu''': ''(Mumbles)'' [[Spinjitzu]]...

'''Kai''': Hey, [[Jay]]. What's up? Huh?

'''Zane''': He appears to have gone into some meditative trance. Or possibly spontaneous self hibernation.

'''Kai''': Nah. He's probably just fantasizing about that. ''(He looks at a mural.)'' Our Elemental vehicles. Created from our [[Golden Weapons]]. Remember those, Zane?

'''Zane''': I don't need to remember. I can recall an enhanced visual augmentation from my data log.

'''Kai''': Hey, we didn't look like that back then.

'''Zane''': I told you, it was an enhanced visual augmentation.

'''Kai''': Whatever.

''(In a flashback, a group of [[Venomari]] raided a city.)''

'''Past [[Spitta]]''': Give me that!

'''Past Kai''': Venomari. Careful, Zane. They spit [[Venomari venom|bad stuff]].

'''Past Spitta''': ''(A group of citizens escape)'' Hey, where do you think you're going? Get back here!

'''Past Zane''': You! Get back here!

'''Past Kai''': No fear, folks! The [[Fire]] Brigadeâ€”Whoa! ''(He falls off his [[Blade Cycle]]. Spitta takes his [[Sword of Fire]].)'' Zane! A little help? Whoa!

'''Past Zane''': Hey, Kai!

'''Past Kai''': Huh?

'''Past Zane''': When is a Venomari truly defeated? When a [[Nindroids|Nindroid]] rolls... ''(He freezes Spitta.)'' ...Snake ice! ''(He gives Kai his sword back. The Venomari warriors throw spears at him but miss.)'' How many guys are there?

'''Venomari Warrors''': Yah! ''(They jump on the back of Zane's [[Snowmobile]].)''

'''Past Zane''': Ah-uh!

'''Past Kai''': Be right with you, Zane! Ninja, go! ''(He does [[Spinjitzu]] and spawns his Blade Cycle, knocking back the warriors surrounding him. He rides after Zane.)'' Hey, Zane. Which bird can swim, dive, and goes "quack"? ''(He stands on his bike.)''

'''Past Zane''': Huh?

'''Past Kai''': ''(He de-spawns his Blade Cycle and throws the Sword of Fire at a light post, which Zane is heading towards.)'' Duck! ''(Zane ducks and the light post slams against the Venomari, knocking them off. The Venomari run away. Kai passes back everyone's belongings. Zane de-spawns his Snowmobile.)''

'''Past Zane''': Thank you, thank you. And now for our encore. ''(He juggles his [[Shurikens of Ice]] and some balls.)''

'''Kai''': Wait a minute, you never did that.

'''Zane''': That is another recent upgrade of mine: selective memory. It can be quite handy, you know.

'''Kai''': Ugh, whatever. Let's get something to eat. You coming, Jay? Jay? Jay! Ugh. Whatever.
