''(The [[ninja]] grunt as [[Jay]] tries on a [[Vermillion]] helmet.)''

'''Jay''': Sorry, guys, nothing.

'''[[Cole]]''': Darn, I was sure trying on the helmet was gonna help us figure out who those samurai snake guys were.

'''[[Nya]]''': Me too. Jay, are you positive the helmet doesn't do anything?

'''Jay''': Ha! Besides make me look cool? What? I know how to accessorize.

'''[[Kai]]''': Hm. Something about this is familiar, though. I just can't place it. Perhaps [[Wu|Master Wu]] knows. ''(They go find Wu, who is resting on a bed.)'' Master Wu, this helmet. I feel like we've seen it before. Can you tell us anything?

'''Wu''': Curious. Time...

'''Kai''': Time?

'''Wu''': Time waits...

'''Nya''': Time waits...

'''Wu''': Time waits for no… ''(He falls back asleep.)''

'''Kai''': Uh, Master?

'''Wu''': ''(He wakes up.)'' Did someone mention lunch?

'''[[Lloyd]]''': No, Master, no one mentioned lunch.

'''Wu''': Then why did you wake me? ''(He sleeps again.)''

'''Lloyd''': He isn't himself.

'''Jay''': Clearly. Lunch isn't for three more hours. Ahh, this is just perfect. Mysterious snake samurai, uh, things attacked [[Ninjago]], [[Cyrus Borg]] is missing, and our team is down one master and one [[Zane|ninja]].

'''Lloyd''': We've got to get Zane back online. He was the last one to see Cyrus Borg.

'''Cole''': Yeah, except Cyrus Borg is the only one who has the equipment to get him back online.

'''Nya''': I might be able to reboot Zane with the computer in the [[Samurai X Cave]]. Although I could use some help.

'''Cole''': Well, I'm in.

'''Jay''': You know I am.

'''Lloyd''': I'll stay. One of us should keep an eye on Master Wu.

'''Kai''': I'll go to the [[Ninjago Museum of History|museum]] and talk to [[Krux|Dr. Saunders]]. He's an expert on all things Ninjago. Maybe he knows what Master Wu is too weak to tell us.

'''Lloyd''': Good thinking. Go and see what you can see.

''(The Vermillion bring Cyrus to the museum and traps him in a [[golden sarcophagus]].)''

'''Krux''': The Vermillion warriors have done well, [[Acronix|brother]]. Borg is captured and the first step of our plan is complete. It's time to begin phase two.

'''Acronix''': How? Phase two requires many more Vermillion than we have.

'''Krux''': We'll have them shortly. With even [[Vermillion eggs|more]] growing in the swamp. Soon, there will be a force of thousands.

'''Acronix''': Okay, but how do the two of us control a force of thousands?

'''Krux''': I've had forty years to develop this plan, brother. Do you not think I took that into account? May I introduce…[[Raggmunk|Commander Raggmunk]], [[Blunck|Commander Blunck]], and [[Machia|Commander Machia]]. Hand selected from the most genetically superior [[Serpentine]]. Their superior intellect allows them to communicate telepathically with the Vermillion warriors and control them to the [[Hive Mind|hive mind]].

'''Acronix''': You've thought of everything.

'''Krux''': Indeed. I bred them to be strategic thinkers. In fact, they've been working out the details for phase two.

'''Blunck''': With your permission, sir, I've outlined an attack so we can—

'''Raggmunk''': ''We've'' outlined. ''(They hiss at each other.)''

'''Acronix''': Hand selected?

'''Krux''': They're fighters. One must expect a certain amount of...aggression.

''(They keep hissing at each other)''

'''Acronix''': ''(hitting his fist)'' The plan!

'''Blunck''': Of course. I will explain.

'''Raggmunk''': We will.

''(They hiss again)''

'''Machia''': Enough! You will tell them the plan or I will eat the two of you for breakfast, bones and all!

'''Krux''': Hm. Aggression.

''(Nya hooks Zane up to the computer.)''

'''Nya''': Okay, he's hooked up to the main computer. Keep your fingers crossed.

'''Jay''': Come on, Zane…Nope. Still out.

'''Cole''': Hang on. There's something on the video feed.

'''Past Cyrus''': Well, this is a surprise. I didn't expect to see you.

'''Past Zane''': Who did you— ''(knock)''

'''Jay''': Um, did I miss something? One second Zane is talking, then nothing.

'''Nya''': Okay, let's try again, only slower. ''(She slows down the video, but still sees nothing.)''

'''Cole''': Oh, there you go. Zane was nailed by, uh, some mysterious blurry thing. Hehe.

'''Jay''': Oh, so all we need to do is round up all the blurs in Ninjago. This tells us nothing!

'''Nya''': Maybe I can slow it down more. ''(She tries to.)'' We lost the connection.

'''Jay''': Aw, and Zane.

''([[Misako]] brings Wu a cup of [[tea]].)''

'''Wu''': Thank you, Misako. Focus Tea might help to clear my head. ''(Lloyd sighs.)'' Maybe you should have some as well.

'''Lloyd''': Uh, what?

'''Wu''': You seem...distant.

'''Lloyd''': Yeah. It's just that, as a master-in-training, it feels like I should be doing something. But what?

'''Wu''': A true Master must always...

'''Lloyd''': Yes, Master? Must always what?

'''Wu''': ''(He sleeps then wakes up.)'' ...and only then will he be a true Master.

'''Lloyd''': Sorry, I-I-I didn't quite get that.

'''Wu''': I said a true Master must… ''(He falls asleep.)''

''(Kai arrives at the museum.)''

'''Kai''': Hello? Dr. Saunders? He's gotta be here somewhere. He's always here. The guy is practically an exhibit himself. If anyone can shed light on the origin of this helmet, it'll be him. [[Maya|Mom]]. [[Ray|Dad]]. I wish I could ask you what this is. Actually, I wish I could ask you anything. It's been so long.

''(Kai remembers meeting Nya for the first time.)''

'''Past Maya''': Kai, say hello to your sister Nya.

'''Past Kai''': ''(Holding an infant Nya)'' Hello... ''(Echoes)''

'''Kai''': Your kids miss you, you know.

''(The commanders finish explaining their plan.)''

'''Krux''': Excellent. You may strike when ready.

'''Blunck''': My sentries say we have a visitor.

'''Krux''': It's a museum. We have lots of visitors.

'''Raggmunk''': This one's a ninja.

'''Acronix''': A ninja? We need to see what he's up to. Oh, wait, I bet you never set up a security camera, Mr. I-Hate-All-Technology-Even-Though-It's-Cool!

'''Krux''': I have something better. ''(He shows him a spy scope.)''

'''Acronix''': The [[Fire]] Ninja! He must be onto us! Perhaps he's more dangerous than I first thought. I'll [[Forward Time Blade|neutralize]] him before he uncovers our plans.

'''Krux''': No. That will draw too much attention to everything. I will take care of this. This changes nothing. Commence phase two.

''(Nya inserts a device into the computer.)''

'''Nya''': Upgrade complete. Say hello to Super Slow Motion. ''(They pause the video.)''

'''Cole''': Acronix? I though he got, you know, finished off at the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu|monastery]].

'''Jay''': He did!

'''Nya''': Apparently not. And look, he's still got the [[Forward Time Blade|Time Blade]]! ''(They continue the video to show Acronix taking Borg.)''

'''Jay''': That's why Zane never saw him coming. Acronix fast forwarded into a blur!

'''Nya''': But wait. Cyrus Borg said he saw someone approaching before that. But who? ''(They play the video to see Dr. Saunders.)''

'''Jay''': That's...Dr. Saunders.

'''Cole''': Hold on. That means he and Acronix...

'''Cole and Jay''': Are working together!?

'''Cole''': And he's hooked up with those slithering Samurais too.

'''Jay''': Oh, I always knew there was something snakey about that guy!

'''Nya''': No, there wasn't. Dr. Saunders is such a kind old man. Remember all the school field trips to the museum?

'''Jay''': Exactly! And how boring were those?

'''Cole''': I kinda liked them.

'''Jay''': The point is, he's definitely gone full snake now.

'''Nya''': ''(Gasps.)'' And Kai is headed right into that snake's nest!

''(Krux, disguised as Dr. Saunders, approaches Kai.)''

'''Kai''': Aah! Dr. Saunders!

'''Krux''': In the very flesh-flesh. You were expecting different doctor?

'''Kai''': No, you just startled me. But actually, I was looking for you.

'''Krux''': Were you now?

'''Kai''': Do you recognize this? ''(He shows him the helmet.)''

'''Krux''': Hm. It slightly resembles a post-[[Serpentine War]] Samurai battle helmet, but is probably just a knock-off. Cheapy-cheap-cheap. Perhaps costume from Ninjago Con?

'''Kai''': Uh, I don't think so. We got it off a snakey Samurai Warrior we defeated.

'''Krux''': Snake Warrior?

'''Kai''': Actually, a bunch of snakes, all, like, twisted into one, attacked the Borg Store. It was on the news. Don't you watch TV?

'''Krux''': I despise TV. ''(His voice slowly goes back to normal.)'' A vile, bilious contraption. ''(He fixes his voice.)'' I-I-I mean, interesting. Heh! If you leave it with me, perhaps I can look into its origin. Heh! Goodbye. ''(He walks away with the helmet.)''

'''Kai''': Master Wu always says "Never put off until tomorrow what can be done today." So I would like to look around now. Maybe I'll stumble on something useful. Is that okay?

'''Krux''': Of course. We are open to the public for seven days of the week. Late on Thursdays.

''(Nya, Cole, and Jay rushes out the Cave.)''

'''Nya''': Hurry! We've got to get to Kai before that double-crossing Dr. Saunders.

'''Cole''': What about Zane?

'''Nya''': He'll be fine. I've got him on a restore and reboot protocol.

'''[[P.I.X.A.L.]]''': ''(On computer)'' Zane. Zane. Wake up. Wake up! ''(Sighs.)'' Come on, snap out of it. He needs us! Ugh!

''(The Vermillion attacks the [[Ninjago City|city]].)''

'''Raggmunk''': Fresh off the rack! Arise, my army!

'''Blunck''': ''Our'' army!

'''Machia''': Let's hope for your sake phase two is a success. Or they will become my army!

'''Blunck''': No, they'd still be our—

''(The Vermillion attacks.)''

'''Raggmunk''': Yes! Grab the best...the most skilled...and the finest craftspeople!!

''(Kai checks the museum while Krux tries to keep his cover hidden.)''

'''Kai''': Master Wu taught us that any problem can be solved. It just takes thought and time.

'''Krux''': I am quite very certain there is nothing to interest you here.

'''Kai''': Hm, I don't know. I mean, what if this guy was related to the snakes we fought?

'''Krux''': Not likely. And really, I doubt you'll find anything. Our collection is mostly harmless artifacts.

'''Kai''': Hmm. Maybe. But you never know what might open the door to some secret information. ''(He sits on a chair, unknowingly opening a door to their base.)'' Something I'm missing. Like, you know the expression, "one can't see the forest for the trees?"

'''Acronix''': You said you were taking care of this.

'''Kai''': Something that's right in front of me.

'''Krux''': I am taking care of this.

'''Acronix''': No, I am! ''(he grabs a Time Blade, but Kai stands up, closing the door on him.)''

'''Krux''': Now, really, I must insist you to go [[Temple of Airjitzu|home]]. It is after closing time.

'''Kai''': Yeah, I guess you're right. It was a longshot, anyway. Wait a minute. ''(Gasps.)'' That's it! The helmet! It's just like the one [[Time Twins|they]] were wearing. But wait, Acronix is gone and Master Wu said Krux was lost in time forever. So that means Krux must still be around somewhere!

'''Krux''': Don't be ridiculous. I have told you, they are myth. ''(His fake mustache falls off.)''

'''Kai''': What is the—Dr. Saunders! You. You're Krux! Which means Master Wu was wrong! You weren't lost in time!

'''Krux''': No, no, no, no, no, no. That is positively...''(his voice goes back to normal)'' correct. I've been hiding here, right under his nose for decades.

'''Kai''': I knew I'd seen that helmet before!

'''Krux''': Well, aren't you clever? Such a smart little ninja.

''(Cole, Jay, and Nya drive toward the museum but see Vermillion warriors attacking the city.)''

'''Cole''': Uh, guys, look who's back.

'''Jay''': Oh, now what are they up to?

'''Cole''': They're either kidnapping more people or organizing a parade.

'''Jay''': Aw, I love a parade. Nya, keep going to the museum. We'll deal with these guys.

'''All''': Ninja, go!

''(Kai attacks Krux.)''

'''Kai''': Ninja, go!

'''Krux''': I almost forgot that Wu taught you [[Spinjitzu]].

'''Kai''': Yeah, but I came up with this one all on my own. ''(He jumps on the statue Acronix was spying on with.)''

'''Acronix''': I knew I should have dealt with him when I had a chance. ''(He tries to go out, but the sarcophagus blocks the entrance, trapping him, but revealing Cyrus.)''

'''Kai''': Cyrus Borg! So you kidnapped him!

'''Krux''': I prefer the term "acquired."

'''Kai''': That means you took out Zane too.

'''Krux''': Nothing is getting by you. Today is your day. Too bad it's your last. You and I are nearly an equal match, but let's see how you do against both Hands of Time! Brother! Brother?

'''Acronix''': Come on!

''(Jay and Cole attacks some of the warriors.)''

'''Jay''': Looks like somebody wants to play. Wish we had the rest of the team here to help.

'''Cole''': Well, say hello to our newest members. Lefty and Righty. ''(He uses his [[Earth Punch]], but can't control it.)'' Oops. Wow, if I'm not more careful, I can take all of us out.

'''Jay''': Lefty, Righty, nice to meet you. Also, do better!

'''Cole''': Okay, okay. ''(He uses it again, but just breaks more stuff.)''

'''Jay''': Cole, seriously!? Watch where you're throwing those things!

'''Cole''': It's out of my hands! Aah!

'''Jay''': It ''is'' your hands!

'''Cole''': I'm still trying to get used to them.

'''Jay''': Okay. How about getting used to them in ''their'' direction?

'''Cole''': ''(He accidentally launched Jay into a dumpster.)'' Jay!

'''Machia''': Fools! Did you forget your mission? We need the people. Forget fighting the ninja.

'''Blunck''': But Commander Machia, they are warriors. Fighting is what they do.

'''Machia''': Which is why we need the people. There is much to follow phase two. Into the sewers.

'''Cole''': Hurry, Jay. Get out of there.

'''Jay''': Just don't hurt me. ''(He gets out, but the streets are empty.)''

'''Cole''': Uh, hey. What?

'''Jay''': Where'd they go?

''(Nya arrives in the museum.)''

'''Nya''': Snakes. Why am I not surprised? ''(They attack her.)'' Okay, that surprised me. ''(She uses [[Water]] to push them outside.)'' Stay! No more surprises. ''(She rushes to find Kai.)''

'''Krux''': Is that all you've got? Your parents would be very disappointed!

'''Kai''': Don't you ever mention my parents. Aah!

'''Krux''': Wu may have been a good teacher, but he's not here to help you now.

'''Kai''': Don't you mention Wu either.

'''Krux''': Oh, ninja, such misplaced loyalty.

'''Kai''': My parents helped Wu and [[Garmadon]] defeat you once. And I will do it again.

'''Krux''': ''(Laughs.)'' Is that what you think?

'''Kai''': That's what I know. Master Wu told me!

'''Krux''': But you were not there, young ninja. I was, your parents were, and Wu. He told you a lie. Your parents were not who you think they are. They didn't fight against us. They fought with us.

'''Kai''': What? It can't be. They were heroes!

'''Krux''': True, they ''were'' heroes. But heroes for ''our'' side.

'''Kai''': I don't believe you. Master Wu would never lie!

'''Krux''': Surely you can see why he didn't want you to know the truth. Your parents were traitors!

'''Kai''': No!

'''Krux''': Oh, Kai, you've let your emotions get the best of you. The truth hurts, doesn't it?

'''Kai''': Not as much as this will. ''(Acronix managed to get out.)''

'''Acronix''': Ugh. Sorry I'm late.

'''Kai''': Acronix!

'''Krux''': Ah, yes. You've met my twin brother.

'''Kai''': You know, for twins, one of you looks much older.

'''Acronix''': He was born three minutes earlier.

'''Krux''': Time waits for no one, young ninja.

'''Acronix''': But it's time out—''(He gets splashed with Water.)''

'''Nya''': Aw, gee. What a mess. And to think we just cleaned up the museum.

'''Kai''': Nya! Good to see you, sis.

'''Nya''': Back at you, bro. Now let's teach these two a lesson in sibling rivalry. ''(They continued fighting.)''

'''Acronix''': They are good.

'''Kai''': Switch?

'''Nya''': He's all yours.

'''Krux''': But we are better, brother.

'''Nya''': I could probably use a hand, brother.

'''Kai''': I'm here for you, sister. ''(She kicks Krux inside the sarcophagus.)'' Hahaha. Looks like we have the upper hand. ''(Acronix sees Borg trying to reach the Time Blade.)''

'''Nya''': The Time Blade. Don't let him—

'''Acronix''': Until next time. ''(The Time Twins and Borg disappear.)''

'''Kai''': No! We can't let him—use it.

'''Nya''': Oh! Too late. They're gone. And so is Borg.

'''Kai''': Vanished. Before our eyes. ''(He grabs the helmet.)''

''(They go back to the Cave.)''

'''Nya''': So it looks like Acronix and Krux are working with those Samurai snakes.

'''Jay''': Yeah, but why are they kidnapping all of Ninjago's builders?

'''Cole''': There is still way too much we don't know here.

'''Kai''': Like, was Krux lying, or are my parents really...traitors?

'''Nya''': You seem lost in another place...or time. What is it?

'''Kai''': Uh, what if everything you believed in turned out to be a lie?

'''Nya''': What?

'''Kai''': I—

'''Cole''': Hey, he's rebooting!

'''Zane''': Four, seven, two, one...nine.
