}}''(In the [[Heart of the Mountain]], the [[Upply]] are figuring out how to get out.)''

'''[[Wu]]''': Here are the facts. We are lost underground, separated from our friends who are being hunted by an [[Vangelis|evil necromancer]] and an [[Re-Awakened|army of reanimated skeletons]]. We have very few weapons and no way out, but we are not giving in to despair. Where there is a will, there is a way, and we ''will'' find it. I want suggestions. Ideas.

'''[[Cole]]''': I've got an idea. But this one's a little nuts.

'''[[Plundar]]''': "This one"?

'''Wu''': Let's hear it.

'''Cole''': (He draws on the ground with a stick.) These are the tracks we found earlier, which I'm guessing lead to the surface. And let's pretend this is the mine cart. (He takes a mushroom from [[Fungus]]'s hat.) We take the wheels off, then strap the axle to the [[Stone Mech|mech]] like a pair of giant rollerskates, and use the mech to propel the other carts back up the tracks. Propelling, please? (Fungus makes the mushroom glow and spin with magic.) Then, we get in the carts, and go zipping back up the tracks, like this. (He sets the mushroom on the ground, which zips along the tracks he drew, then flies up and explodes.)

'''[[Korgran]]''': Explosion is us?

'''Plundar''': That idea seems a little ... what's the word I'm looking for? Oh yeah. Nuts.

'''Cole''': I told you that at the start! Yeesh, nobody listens.

'''[[Vania]]''': Well, I don't hear any other suggestions, so unless you guys want to give up and just go back to [[Rock-Bottom]]...

'''Wu''': I vote in favor of Cole's plan.

'''Fungus''': As do I.

'''Korgran''': Korgran also. And also [[Korgran's axe|Korgran's non-speaking axe]].

'''Korgran's axe''': Haha, you guys are bananas!

'''Korgran''': Uh...

'''Fungus''': Well, Plundar? What do [[Plundar's dice|your dice]] advise?

'''Plundar''': (He throws his dice away.) I'm deciding this one, and you've gotten me this far, so I'm with you all the way.

''(The Upply get to work, and Cole and Wu climb into the mech.)''

'''Cole''': I don't get it! There's no buttons, no dials. How are you supposed to operate this thing? (The crystals glow at his touch.) What?

'''Wu''': What did you do?

'''Cole''': Nothing! I - I barely touched it!

'''Wu''': Hmm. Is it possible that this mech is powered entirely by Elemental Energy?

'''Cole''': (He touches the crystals again, and the mech powers up.) Haha! This is gonna be a piece of cake! (He nearly crushes the others on the ground.) Sorry, my bad.

'''Plundar''': Uh, left. A little left!

'''Korgran''': Careful!

'''Wu''': Keep it together, Cole! Concentrate!

'''Cole''': Okay, I think I've got it now. You can do this. It's just like walking on roller skates. On really big, giant-sized roller skates. (He slips again and falls.) Whoops, uh, sorry about that! (He gets up, but falls again, nearly crushing [[Adam]].) Whoops. Uh, sorry!

'''Wu''': Cole.

'''Cole''': Okay, I definitely got it now.

'''Wu''': Let's go!

'''Cole''': Everyone ready?

'''Vania''': No, not really. I'm worried.

'''Cole''': Don't be. This is gonna work!

'''Vania''': Not that. It's ... my father. If we get out of here, I'm going to have to face him, aren't I?

'''Cole''': Yeah, but not alone. We'll be with you.

'''Vania''': Okay. Let's do it!

'''Cole''': Here goes nothing! (He powers up the mech.)

'''Plundar''': Is it too late for me to change my mind?

''(Wu falls out of the cart at a sharp turn.)''

'''Korgran''': (He grabs Wu in time.) No no!

'''Wu''': This is outrageous!

'''Vania''': Cole, the Lava Monster. What if it's still in the cave, waiting for us?

'''Cole''': What, just standing there, staring at a wall? No way, I'm sure he's gone back to his - (They find the Lava Monster waiting for them, and scream as it chases them.) Eat my dust! (He accelerates.)

'''Wu''': You did it, Cole! We're losing him!

'''Fungus''': (They enter a cave with [[Dire Bats]].) Oh, dear.

'''Cole''': (They fight the Bats. Cole swats a Bat away.) Get off! Whew. Hey! (The Lava Monster catches up.) You again? (He fights it with the mech.) This thing has a sword? Yeah!

'''Vania''': Cole, the mine cart. Stop the mine cart!

'''Wu''': Cole!

'''Cole''': (He sees the cart sliding.) Master Wu!

'''Vania''': Hurry, Cole! We're not gonna make it!

'''Cole''': Yes we will! (He destroys the Lava Monster and catches the carts in time.)

'''Korgran''': This stone thing flies too?

'''Cole''': You guys okay?

'''Wu''': We're going too fast!

'''Cole''': I can't slow it down! The lava's overheating the controls! This is gonna get a little bumpy!

'''Old Woman''': What did you say, [[Engelbert]]?

'''Engelbert''': Me? Nothing.

'''Old Woman''': Huh, but you made a sound.

'''Engelbert''': What kind of sound?

'''Old Woman''': A sound, like "Whaaaa".

'''Engelbert''': Don't be ridiculous. Why would I make a sound like -

''(The Upply burst out of the ground near the couple, screaming.)''

'''Cole''': Are you okay?

'''Vania''': (She nods.) Oh, look! We're in the palace gardens!

'''Fungus''': Is that the sky?

'''Wu''': It sure is!

'''Plundar''': You mean we made it?

'''Korgran''': We're out? (The Upply cheer.)

'''Plundar''': We made it!

'''Korgran''': We are not longer Lowly!

'''Fungus''': We're the Upply!

'''Upply''': Upply! Upply! Upply!

''(They enter the throne room and find Chompy caged.)''

'''Vania''': (gasps) [[Chompy]]? Did my father do this to you? Oh, that makes me mad! That makes me so mad! Just hang on, Chompy. Cole? (Cole opens the cage with his [[Earth Punch]].)

'''[[Hailmar]]''': Halt! Princess Vania?

'''Vania''': Hailmar.

'''Hailmar''': (He points his [[naginata]] at Cole.) You.

'''Vania''': Hailmar, it's okay. Cole is a friend.

'''Hailmar''': The King gave orders for the [[ninja]] to be arrested. On sight! He said they are traitors.

'''Vania''': That's not true. My father is the traitor, Hailmar. He's lying to you!

'''Hailmar''': Stand aside, Princess.

'''Vania''': Hailmar, listen. My father is lying to you. He's using you! Cole and these men, they were betrayed by my father. They were cast into the [[Shintaro Mountain|mountain]].

'''Hailmar''': Stand aside, on the King's orders!

'''Vania''': (To Cole) Go!

'''Cole''': What?

'''Vania''': He won't hurt me. Just go!

'''Wu''': Cole, I will stay here. Find the others, save them!

'''Hailmar''': On the King's orders, I command you, stand aside!

'''Cole''': Master Wu, catch!

'''Hailmar''': Stop! I command you! (Cole and the others fight against the palace guards.)

'''Vania''': Chompy! (She sees Chompy grow into the Battle Dragon.) Chompy?

'''Hailmar''': Attack! Stop!

'''Vania''': Hailmar, stand down! I command you! I am heiress to the throne of [[Kingdom of Shintaro|Shintaro]], and your future queen!

'''Hailmar''': Call off your dragon!

'''Vania''': Not until you're ready do listen! (Hailmar charges at Vania.)
