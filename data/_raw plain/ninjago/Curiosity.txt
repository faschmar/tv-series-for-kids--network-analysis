''(In the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu|Monastery]] courtyard, [[Kai]] smashes a brick while [[Jay]] eats a [[Cookies|cookie]] behind him.)''

'''Kai''': See?

'''Jay''': A single brick? Pft, I could break more than that. ''(Kai steals his cookie and eats it before he can.)'' Hey!

'''Kai''': Prove it then. The ninja who can break the most bricks gets to have the last cookie.

'''Jay''': Deal!

''(Kai and Jay stack and break more bricks.)''

'''Jay''': Three bricks! ''(He smashes the bricks, then notices Kai.)'' Hmm.

'''Kai''': Five! ''(He smashes the bricks.)''

'''Jay''': ''(He uses his [[Lightning|powers]] to smash more bricks.)'' Twenty!

'''Kai''': One hundred and one! ''(He smashes a tall pile of bricks with his [[Fire|powers]].)''

''(Defeated, Jay gives the cookie to a smug Kai. Suddenly, [[Wu]] bursts into the courtyard.)''

'''Wu''': What is happening?!

'''Kai''': Oh, uh... it's just, um...

'''Jay''': Uh, training! Uh, getting extra practice in, you know, ninjas never quit.

'''Wu''': But the courtyard. Where did you even get all these bricks? ''(Kai and Jay look towards the wall, which now has a giant hole in the middle.)'' My wall!

''([[Nya]], [[Lloyd]], and [[Cole]] enter the courtyard.)''

'''Nya''': What's going on? Did Jay and Kai mess up again?

'''Wu''': I instructed them to go into the yard and meditate on the six fundamental virtues of [[Spinjitzu]], and instead they demolished my wall! ''([[Zane]] enters the courtyard from a different door.)''

'''Jay''': Oh, right, you did tell us to do something. The six what now?

'''Wu''': Virtues! Don't tell me you've forgotten.

'''Kai''': ''(laughs)'' No way. We'd never forget the seven virtues.

'''Jay''': ''(whispers)'' Six!

'''Kai''': Six.

'''Wu''': Then tell me what they are.

'''Kai''': Right, I will. Uh, okay. They are... important! Huh? That's what they are. Hehe.

'''Wu''': Tell them, Nya.

'''Nya''': Oh! Yeah. The six things. They're on the tip of my tongue.

'''Wu''': Don't any of you remember?

''(The other ninja look away guiltily.)''

'''Wu''': Zane. You have a perfect electronic memory.

'''Zane''': Apologies, Master. I had to take portions of my memory offline in order to defrag them.

'''Wu''': ''(sighs)'' Meditation position. Now!

''(Later, the ninja are meditating.)''

'''Wu''': Curiosity. ''(Nya notices him near her and jumps.)'' Balance. ''(He knocks Cole over.)'' Wisdom. ''(He turns Lloyd around.)'' Honesty. ''(He knocks a cookie out of Jay's hand.)''

'''Jay''': Hey!

'''Wu''': Generosity. Courage. ''(Kai takes a cookie from Zane, but Wu scares him, and the cookies goes flying. Cole prepares to catch the cookie, but the [[Wu's chicken|chicken]] eats it first.)'' These are the six fundamental virtues of Spinjitzu. Through these qualities, a true ninja is forged. ''(Someone knocks the doors loudly.)'' Reflect on what I've just said. ''(He turns to get the door.)''

'''Nya''': ''(whispers)'' Great job, guys. Now we've all got to deal with a grumpy Master Wu! ''(She hears a roar.)'' What was that?

'''Zane''': Unidentified audio input.

'''Nya''': You've got to be at least a little curious.

'''Kai''': Yeah, but we should keep meditating. I don't want to make Master Wu any angrier than he already is.

'''Lloyd''': We're supposed to be meditating. Focus.

'''Nya''': ''(She hears another roar and gets up.)'' I can't. I'm just dying to know what's going on. ''(She opens the doors and gasps.)''

''(A [[Legendary Dragon|green dragon]] attacks the ninja with Wu in hand, while Wu screams.)''

'''Ninja''': Ninja, go! ''(They attempt to rescue Wu, but fail. The dragon takes flight.)''

'''Nya''': Master Wu!

''(The dragon creates a portal and disappears into it.)''

'''Kai''': Whoa.

'''Nya''': The portal's closing!

'''Lloyd''': After Master Wu! Ninja, go!

''(The ninja enter the portal and just as it closes. In the Monastery, the wall Kai and Jay had demolished collapses, and the chicken leaps away in alarm.)''
