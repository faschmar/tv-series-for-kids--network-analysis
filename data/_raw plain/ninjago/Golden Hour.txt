''(A series of past scenes flash by as [[Wu]] narrates.)''

'''Wu''': [[Time]]. The thread that holds the fabric of reality together. You cannot see it, you cannot hold it, and yet it seems you never have enough of it.

'''[[Nya]]''': Master, what are you doing?

'''Wu''': Putting off until tomorrow what cannot be done today. ''(He throws the [[Reversal Time Blade]] at [[Kai]] and Nya, causing them to fall off the [[Iron Doom]] and into the present.)'' As you said, [[Acronix]], it ends now.

''(The Iron Doom floats through time, getting lost in time.)''

'''Acronix''': No! It's destabilizing.

'''[[Krux]]''': We have to secure the other [[Time Blades]]!

'''Wu''': You may find this impossible with me in the way. ''(Suddenly, he is hit by energy.)''

'''Krux''': Or not!

''(Krux and Acronix attack Wu, but are zapped as well, and they end up in [[Fire Temple|a volcano]].)''

'''Acronix''': Where are we? How did we get here?

'''Wu''': Not how, or where. But when?

'''Past [[Lloyd]]''': Kai! Help me!

'''Krux''': Ah, I see. How wonderful. Maybe we can end this before it even began! ''(He lunges at Lloyd, but Wu zaps the twins and they return to the Iron Doom. Wu starts to de-age.)''

'''Acronix''': Huh? He got younger.

'''Krux''': No fair! That means he was hit by the Reversal Time Blade!

'''Acronix''': And the Iron Doom is using his reversal energy! If we get him, we'll have all the time we need!

''(They attack Wu and end up at the [[Temple of Light]].)''

'''Krux''': Ah, again.

'''Past Lloyd''': You guys ready for this?

''(The twins try to stop Lloyd, but Wu stops them in time, and they return to the Iron Doom once again. Wu continues to de-age.)''

'''Acronix''': There is no escape, boy! We ''will'' get you!

''(This time, they are transported outside the monastery where Wu and [[Garmadon]] grew up. As they fight, the past [[Great Devourer]] peers out from the bushes. Meanwhile, young Garmadon disarms young Wu and launches his katana over the wall, where it lands near present Wu and the Time Twins.)''

'''Acronix''': Ooh, lucky me. ''(He runs towards the katana, but Wu trips him.)''

'''Wu''': As much as I wish to change this moment, I know that I cannot.

''(Krux attacks Wu, and the three teleport through [[The Stone Army|more]] [[Enter the Digiverse|past]] [[Day of the Great Devourer|events]] and even a [[Escape from Merlopia|future one]]. Wu de-ages into a child, which causes the twins to laugh.)''

'''Krux''': I don't think we'll have a problem handling a bratty child with an embarrassing haircut!

'''Wu''': Then you've forgotten how rebellious we can be! ''(He throws his staff at Krux and runs towards the [[time apparatus]].)''

'''Acronix''': Wait! The Time Blades belong to us! We are the Hands of Time!

'''Wu''': So you are. And you're nothing but second-hand thugs! Tick, tock! ''(He grabs the time apparatus and the Iron Doom malfunctions.)''

'''Krux and Acronix''': Nooooo!

''(A bright light flashes. The Iron Doom, now in pieces, is revealed to be floating in the timestream; while Wu, now a baby, giggles as he floats as well.)''
