}}'''[[Nya]]''': Rerouting backup power. Shutting down all nonessential [[Samurai X Cave|cave]] functions.

'''[[Jay]]''': Ah, man. Well, I guess that means no more cappuccinos.

'''[[Cole]]''': Guys, this monster just ate one of our power generators!

'''[[Kai]]''': That's it. Let's get out of [[Zane]]'s head and fight this thing.

'''Nya''': Kai, the cave's power levels are fluctuating wildly. If we try to pull you out of Zane's head now, I don't know what will happen. It looks like Cole's on his own

'''Cole''': Uh, a little help? Hey! You come back here!

'''Kai''': Nya, do you have a visual?

'''Nya''': Not with so many systems down. All I have is audio. But what I did see looked gigantic.

'''Zane''': The largest creature in my database is [[Leviathans|the Leviathan]].

'''Jay''': The Leviathan had a lot of eyes. Cole, how many eyes can you see?

'''Cole''': If you haven't noticed, we are nowhere near the [[Endless Sea|ocean]]. Not only does this thing live on land, but it can also scale a mountain.

'''Zane''': That sounded like several legs moving at once. Like a giant [[Spykor|spider]].

'''Jay''': Spiders...like a [[Tiger Widows|Tiger Widow]]?

'''Past Jay''': Ew, uh. Here, Tiger Widow. I like tigers. Are you a little tiger? Or just a big scaredy cat? Hehehe. Aah! It's so big! Whoa. Ugh. This is not okay!

'''Kai''': When did this happen?

'''Jay''': Uh, I have my own life, you know.

'''Cole''': Don't you think I would recognize a giant spider if I saw one? It would be like a regular spider but bigger!

'''Kai''': Ugh. I can't just sit here and do nothing! We need to get back in our bodies and help Cole!

'''Nya''': Not happening, guys. The power is just too unstable right now. Don't forget, Zane needs us too.

'''Jay''': We can still help Cole, even if we're stuck inside Zane's head. We can fight it with knowledge.

'''Nya''': This thing is new to the neighborhood, so I'm guessing it was drawn to the extra power I used to digitize everyone and keep Zane online. Cole, any chance the creature displays electrical properties?

'''Cole''': Uh, would a mouth full of sparking energy count? Aah! That's a yes to electric powers.

'''Jay''': Ooh, ooh, ooh! Is it powered by [[Electro-Cobrai]]?

'''Cole''': Electro-Cobrai power [[Nindroid Army|robots]], and this is definitely not a robot.

'''Kai''': [[Nimbus]] was electrified. Maybe you could beat this thing the same way we beat Nimbus?

'''Past Zane''': Is this the Master Writer? He's in charge of our destiny?

'''Past Kai''': Whoever he is, I don't think he's handing over the [[Sword of Sanctuary|sword]].

'''Past Jay''': It's locked!? Okay, so now I know how that feels.

'''Cole''': Ugh! I would love to defeat this thing by writing it a very unhappy ending, but I left the destiny scrolls in my other pants. Argh!

'''Kai''': Cole, are you okay?

'''Cole''': I dove into a cave. I think it was the wrong cave.

'''Nya''': The Samurai X Cave is part of an underground system of caverns. They're all connected, so you should be fine if you keep moving.

'''Cole''': ''(Screams.)''

'''Jay''': Electric powers...like a [[Lightning Dragon (disambiguation)|Lightning Dragon]]?

'''Cole''': Why would your Lightning Dragon attack the Samurai X Cave? Our [[dragons]] have always helped us.

'''Jay''': Well, most of the time.

'''Past Jay''': Come on, Wisp. It'll be a quick visit. Just in and out, nothing more.

'''Nya''': So why is it attacking us?

'''Zane''': It could be because Cole is a [[ninja]]. And what hunts ninja?

'''All except Cole''': The [[Grundles|Grundle]]!

'''Zane''': Though now extinct, the Grundle was one of the most feared and dangerous creatures in all of [[Ninjago]]. With claws that can slice through steel and heightened senses that could detect the stealthiest ninja from miles away.

'''Cole''': Good suggestion! I'd run and get the [[Tea#Tomorrow's Tea|Tomorrow's Tea]] that we used to defeat the Grundle if this thing wasn't trying to eat our backup generator!

'''Kai''': Guys, we don't need to know ''what'' Cole is fighting, just ''how'' to fight it. If it has long legs like a [[Treehorns|Treehorn]], you could trip it.

'''Past Kai''': Ninja, g—ugh.

'''Nya''': Is it a [[Ravtures|Ravture]]? Maybe it just wants to protect its young.

'''Cole''': No, all this thing wants to do is eat me, then eat the Samurai X power source, and then eat all of you. In that order.

'''Zane''': Does it want to eat the metal? Maybe it is a species similar to the astro parasites we encountered on [[Delta V]].

'''Past Zane''': Hello there, little friend.

'''Past Jay''': Oh, would you look at that? Can you believe it? It's an extraterrestrial lifeform.

'''Past Cole''': It's a bug. And it's not what's important right now.

'''Past Jay''': Oh, there's so much we could learn from it. So much we could teach it. I'm gonna call him Glowy.

'''Past Nya''': Inside the meteorite, there were the fossilized remains of some kind of parasite that feeds on metal alloys.

'''Past Zane''': They tickle

'''Past Jay''': Silly Glowy.

'''Past Zane''': Ow.

'''Past Nya''': Do you hear me? Whatever you do, don't come in contact with the parasites. They eat through metal!

'''Past Zane''': Argh! They're eating through my exoskeleton!

'''Past Jay''': Bad, Glowy! Bad!

'''Cole''': Ha! Let's see you chase me in these tiny tunnels! Okay, it's actually snakier than I thought.

'''Nya''': But it has legs?

'''Jay''': Lightning Dragon!

'''Kai''': Uh, could be a dragon.

'''Zane''': But which dragon? They all have different specialties, and Ninjago's crawling with them.

'''Cole''': Gah! Okay, I just back-flipped over this thing, and I didn't see any wings. Can we all agree that dragons have wings?

'''Kai''': Maybe it's not any dragon we've seen before. Dragons evolve all the time.

'''Past Wu''': Every adolescent dragon goes through a transformation before it becomes an adult. We must allow them to migrate east to the [[Spirit Coves]] for their transformation.

'''Past Cole''': Our [[Ultra Dragon|dragons]] are back!

'''Past Zane''': It appears they too have found their [[True Potential]].

'''Cole''': Guys, it does have some kind of rocky spine up the back.

'''Zane''': Perhaps it is a [[Mud monsters|mud monster]] from the [[Realm of Madness]]. Or [[Craglings]]. Or [[Geotomic Rock Monsters]].

'''Past Nya''': Put me down!

'''Past Kai''': You heard my sister! Put her down!

'''Zane''': How did we defeat them?

'''Past Nya''': Kai! [[Fire]] and [[Water]] combined! The steam is cracking it!

'''Cole''': Uh, you know I'm the [[Earth]] Ninja and don't have Water and Fire abilities, right?

'''Nya''': I've almost got our power back on.

'''Kai''': Great! Now we can go help Cole!

'''Cole''': No, no. I'm fine. I've almost got it beat. It looks tired. Real tired. I just need to cut it off before it reaches another generator.

'''Nya''': Oh!

'''Zane''': A battle with a serpent-like creature in a series of caves—Caves—Caves...

'''Nya''': Enough memory files have been corrupted that Zane might need you inside his head to even remember who he is.

'''Jay''': I think Zane was trying to talk about our run-in with [[Clouse]]'s pet [[Anacondrai serpent|serpent]].

'''Kai''': Zane's memories might be wiped, but ours aren't. We defeated the [[Anacondrai]] Serpent with a cave in. Can you try that?

'''Cole''': On it! [[Earth Punch]]! Aah!

'''Nya''': Are you okay?

'''Kai''': Cole? Are you there?

'''Jay''': Ugh! I told you we should have helped!

'''Cole''': Phew! All clear!

'''Jay''': Ha! It worked! We did it! Now back to the Ninjigma.

'''Cole''': Uh, wait! ''We'' did it? I caused the cave in!

'''Jay''': Yeah, and who told you to do that?

'''Cole''': Kai.

'''Kai''': Guys, focus. We still need to stop this mystery force from taking over Zane's body. Right, Nya? ''(Zane gets up from the table.)''

'''Nya''': Zane! You're okay!

'''Zane''': ''(Deep voice)'' I'm more than okay

'''Nya''': Guys? Help!
