''(The episode begins at [[Chen]]'s [[Chen's Palace|Palace]] with Master Chen and [[Clouse]] playing ping-pong.)''

'''Chen''': Really? Is that all you've got, Clousey-Clouse? ''(Loses the round.)''

'''Clouse''': I'm afraid so, Master.

'''Chen:''' You got lucky this time. ''(Serves the ball and loses another round.)''

'''Clouse:''' Whoopsey.

'''Chen:''' No! That doesn't count! I wasn't ready!

'''Clouse:''' Of course, Master. ''(Serves the ball for another round and wins again.)''

'''Chen:''' No! Stop, cheater!

''(Several rounds are shown with Master Chen losing each of them.)''

'''Chen''': Ugh. Clouse! Oof. No! ''(Sighs. Grunts.)''

''(A ping-pong balances on the net.)''

'''Chen''': Yes...yes... ''(The ball falls on his side of the board.)'' Oh, enough!

''(Furious, he presses a button on his chair that fires ping-pong balls at Clouse and uses this to serve a ball that Clouse doesn't hit back, making him lose.)''

'''Chen''': ''(Celebrating on the board.)'' Winnerâ€” ''(The board folds him inside.)''
