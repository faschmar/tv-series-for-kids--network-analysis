''(The ninja attempt to open a closed door, while [[Ripper Sharks]] ram at the glass behind them.)''

'''[[Lloyd]]''': We've gotta get out of here!

'''[[Nya]]''': This isn't gonna hold!

'''[[Jay]]''': There's no handle! How do we open this thing?

'''Lloyd''': Look for some kind of switch or pressure plate!

'''[[Maya]]''': Ugh, there's nothing! Lloyd, look out!

''(The sharks break the glass and Lloyd dodges out of the way. Nya uses her [[Water|powers]] to push them back, when suddenly the door opens briefly, then shuts the sharks out.)''

'''[[Benthomaar]]''': Are you okay?

'''Nya''': Who are you?

'''Benthomaar''': Benthomaar, the [[Trimaar|King]]'s son. His... adopted son.

'''Lloyd''': We didn't attack the King!

'''Benthomaar''': I know. It was [[Kalmaar]].

'''Nya''': Is the King... 

'''Benthomaar''': He's... he's... ''(He shakes his head.)''

'''Nya''': I'm sorry. ''(Just then, Ripper Sharks bang at the doors.)''

'''Benthomaar''': We don't have long. Follow me! I have to get you out of here.

'''Jay''': Where are you taking us?

'''Benthomaar''': The hangar bay. Your [[Hydro Bounty|vessel]] was taken there. ''(The stop at a corner, where they see some [[Maaray Guards]].)'' Wait here. I'll get them to leave.

'''Jay''': Are we sure we can trust this guy?

'''Nya''': No, but he didn't have to help us.

''(The Maaray Guards leave and Benthomaar waves the ninja over.)''

'''[[Zane]]''': What did you tell them?

'''Benthomaar''': I told them that Kalmaar sent for them. By the time he finds out I lied, we'll be long gone. Follow me. ''(They enter the hangar bay to find multiple guards.)'' Oh. Hello. Um, these are my friends, from out of town!

'''Jay''': Don't worry, I got this. Hi, we're visiting from another underwater city! Heh, not the surface. It's called, um, uh, Bubbletubblepopolis! Yeah! You know, it's pretty far away, you probably haven't heard of it. ''(Whispering to Benthomaar)'' I think they bought it. ''(A guard blasts at him.)'' Whoa! This is no way to treat a tourist! ''(Zane struggles to take a [[trident]] from a guard, but ends up accidentally hitting a tank containing [[manta rays]].)'' The citizens of Bubbletubblepopolis will not be pleased! This will affect... your tourism!

''(Lloyd leaps into an [[APS suits|APS suit]] and attacks the guards, while the others fight them on the ground.)''

'''Nya''': Mom! ''(She points at a guard behind Maya.)''

'''Maya''': ''(She kicks the guard away.)'' What?

'''Nya''': Mm, nothing.

'''[[P.I.X.A.L.]]''': I'll start up the sub!

----

''(In the throne room, Kalmaar picks up his blue [[Kalmaar's trident|trident]], and strikes it on the ground, turning its glow red.)''

'''Kalmaar''': That's more like it.

'''[[Gripe]]''': Kalmaar! ''(He startles Kalmaar again, causing him to shriek and accidentally blast the throne.)'' Forgive me, my Lord, I did not intend to startle you.

'''Kalmaar''': What do you want?

'''Gripe''': Sir, the Ripper Sharks were released as you commanded.

'''Kalmaar''': Good. Bring me whatever is left of the ninja.

'''Gripe''': Unfortunately, Sir, the Ripper Sharks seem to have been... unable to locate the ninja.

'''Kalmaar''': What?

'''Gripe''': The ninja have disappeared.

'''Kalmaar''': Disappeared? What do you mean, disappeared?

'''Maaray Guard''': You sent for us, Sir?

'''Kalmaar''': What in the [[Endless Sea]] are you babbling about?

'''Maaray Guard''': We were guarding the hangar bay and Benthomaar dismissed us and said you sent for us.

'''Kalmaar''': The hangar? To the hangar bay! Benthomaar is in league with the surface dwellers!

----

''(In the hangar bay, the ninja fight off the guards while entering the Hydro Bounty. Just then, Kalmaar arrives.)''

'''Kalmaar''': Stop them! Fire!

'''Lloyd''': Go! Get out of here!

'''Nya''': What about you?

'''Lloyd''': I'll catch up! Go!

'''Automated voice''': Warning. Hull damage, 70 percent integrity. 60 percent. 50 percent. 40 percent. 30 percent. 20...

'''Nya''': Lloyd! We... are... leaving!

''(Lloyd turns to leave, but is hit by a blast.)''

'''Kalmaar''': You will rue the day you ever set foot in the sea!

'''Lloyd''': I'm already ruing it! ''(He throws a giant blade at Kalmaar with his mech and dives into the water. Kalmaar dodges it.)''

'''Kalmaar''': Don't just stand there, they're getting away! After them!

'''Jay''': P.I.X.A.L., reduce speed! We're losing Lloyd!

'''Lloyd''': No, keep going! I'll catch up! ''(He manages to latch onto the Bounty, but sees that they're being pursued.)'' Uh oh.

'''Jay''': Sonar contact! Six signals behind us, approaching fast!

'''Lloyd''': P.I.X.A.L., punch it!

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Accelerating to maximum speed.

'''Kalmaar''': Blast them from the sea! ''(Gripe sends a torpedo at the Bounty.)''

'''Jay''': Torpedo in the water! Bearing zero zero nine!

'''Zane''': Hard left rudder. West two two nine. Make your depth nine thousand!

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Hold on, Lloyd!

'''Lloyd''': Look out!

'''Kalmaar''': Fire! What are you waiting for?

'''Gripe''': But the city! If we miss, we would strike our own.

'''Kalmaar''': Fire again! ''(Gripe hesitates, then fires.)''

'''Jay''': Another torpedo!

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Hard left rudder. Hold on!

'''Benthomaar''': There's an opening there. A tunnel. If we can reach it, we might be able to escape.

'''Jay''': New course. Two one seven. Full speed ahead!

'''Kalmaar''': Goodbye, Benthomaar. Fire!

'''Jay''': Three torpedoes, five hundred yards and closing!

'''Zane''': Time to impact?

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Ten seconds.

'''Zane''': Range to tunnel?

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': One hundred yards.

'''Jay''': We're not gonna make it!

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Launching counter measures. ''(She deploys three [[Wu Bots]], causing the torpedoes to veer off course.)'' Ten seconds to impact. Nine seconds. Eight. Seven. Six.

'''Gripe''': What?

''(The Bounty passes through the tunnel safely just before it collapses.)''

'''Kalmaar''': ''(Screams in anger)''

----

''(The ninja breathe a sigh of relief.)''

'''Nya''': Lloyd, are you okay?

'''Lloyd''': Yeah, I'm fine. But the ''Hydro Bounty''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gonna need a new paint job. It's a mess out here.

----

'''Nya''': Benthomaar, these are my friends. Zane, P.I.X.A.L., Jay, Lloyd, and my mother, Maya.

'''Benthomaar''': It is good to meet you.

'''Lloyd''': Yeah, same here.

'''Jay''': Um, please don't take this the wrong way, but why exactly are you helping us?

'''Benthomaar''': Kalmaar seeks to awaken [[Wojira]] and destroy the surface world. I promised my father I would do everything in my power to stop him.

'''Nya''': He can't awaken Wojira without the [[Storm Amulet|second amulet]], and we know where it is.

'''Benthomaar''': Then I suggest we get there first. This is one race we cannot afford to lose.

'''Nya''': We won't. Not if we have anything to say about it. P.I.X.A.L., set course for the [[Island of the Keepers]]. Full speed ahead.
