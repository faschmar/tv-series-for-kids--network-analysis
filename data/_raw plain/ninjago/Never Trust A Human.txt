([[Wu]] tells [[Kai]], [[Cole]], [[Jay]], and [[P.I.X.A.L.]] the story about how he met [[Aspheera]].)

'''Wu''': In the days of my father, the [[First Spinjitzu Master]], there was peace between [[humans]] and [[Serpentine]], but it was a fragile peace. Humans were forbidden to enter the [[Desert of Doom|lands of the Serpentine]]. And the Serpentine were forbidden to enter the lands of men.

(A flashback is shown when Wu and [[Garmadon]] were children. Wu and Garmadon are playing with their staffs.)

'''Past Wu''': I'm tired of the lake. I don't wanna go swimming today.

'''Past Garmadon''': What do you wanna do?

'''Past Wu''': I wanna go that way. (He points to a wooden sign with a snake engraved on it.)

'''Past Garmadon''': That's the Serpentine Valley, Wu. We're not allowed there. Father promised [[Mambo V|King Mambo]], remember?

'''Past Wu''': Nobody will ever know. We'll just take a quick look and come right back. Come on. Don't you want to see the Serpentine? Are you even a little curious? Hmm? (Wu and Garmadon look at the Serpentine Valley behind bushes.) Wow!

([[Pyro Vipers|Hypnobrai]] are shown to be carrying loads, while two others are using hammers to drive a metal stake into the ground.)

'''Past Garmadon''': Okay, now you've seen it. Let's go before someone—

(Wu and Garmadon are surrounded by [[Pyro Vipers|Hypnobrai]] holding swords. The two boys both drop their staffs. They are taken inside King Mambo V's pyramid.)

'''Past Mambo V''': (Sitting in his throne.) You…are the [[Sons of the First Spinjitzu Master|children of the First Spinjitzu Master]]?

'''Past Garmadon''': Yes, sir.

'''Past Wu''': We're sorry! We-

'''Past Mambo V''': Silence! (Mambo slithers down from his throne.) You have recklessly endangered a peace between humans and Serpentine that has existed for millennia. Your foolishness has put me in...a difficult position.

(A young Aspheera and [[Char]] watch the boys, hiding. Wu looks at them, confused.)

'''Past [[Mambo's advisor]]''': They are the children of the First Spinjitzu Master, Sire. We must proceed cautiously.

'''Past Mambo V''': Put them in a cell for a night. Let them think on their foolishness.

'''Past Mambo's advisor''': Very wise!

(Wu and Garmadon are taken away by two Hypnobrai and put in a cell.)

'''Past Garmadon''': I can't believe this! This is all your fault! I'm gonna tell Father everything.

'''Past Wu''': You wanted to go too, remember? I asked you and you said—

'''Past Garmadon''': I said no! N.O. I said we shouldn't, but you wouldn't—huh?

(Wu and Garmadon see Aspheera behind the cell door.)

'''Past Aspheera''': Is it true? You are the children of the First Spinjitzu Master?

'''Past Wu''': Who-who are you?

(Aspheera smiles.)

'''Past Garmadon''': What do you want from us?

'''Past''' '''Aspheera''': I am called Aspheera. I'm training to be a sorceress in service to the king. Tell me, do you truly know the secrets of [[Spinjitzu]]? (Wu and Garmadon hesitate to answer.) For a price, perhaps I could help you. I could open this door. I know several spells already. One of them will bend steel.

'''Past Wu''': What price?

'''Past Garmadon''': We don't have any money.

'''Past Aspheera''': I do not speak of coin. I ask only for friendship. Who says serpents and humans can't be friends? And between friends, there must be trust, sharing. You must share the secrets of Spinjitzu with me.

'''Past Garmadon''': Deal! Let us out!

'''Past Aspheera''': (To Wu) You too. I wish to hear you say the words. Promise me.

(Garmadon nods at Wu.)

'''Past Wu''': Uh...I promise.

(Aspheera laughs and casts a spell, opening the door. Wu and Garmadon leave the cell and run home, now night time.)

'''Wu (Narrating)''': So Aspheera freed us and we ran back home.

(Wu and Garmadon try sneaking past their father.)

'''Past First Spinjitzu Master''': And where have you two been?

'''Past Garmadon''': At the lake! Wu caught a fish, but it broke the line and we spent the rest of the day trying to re-catch it.

(They both smile.)

'''Past First Spinjitzu Master''': Is that so?

(Wu and Garmadon look at each other.)

'''Past Wu''': W-What are you working on, Father?

(Wu walks toward the table where his father is working. Garmadon follows.)

'''Past First Spinjitzu Master''': (Working on a scroll.) Oh, uh, something new.

'''Past Wu''': (Reading one of the [[Scrolls of Forbidden Spinjitzu]].) "The Art of [[Forbidden Spinjitzu]]."

'''Past Garmadon''': Forbidden Spinjitzu?! Are those for us?

'''Past First Spinjitzu Master''': No. They are far too powerful.

'''Past Wu and Garmadon''': Aww.

'''Past First Spinjitzu Master''': Now off to bed, both of you. Go. Go.

(Garmadon and Wu are shown in their beds, the latter being awake.)

'''Wu (Narrating)''': That night, I could not sleep. I was troubled by the promise I had made. A promise Garmadon had no intention of keeping. But one which I felt I must. (It cuts to Wu walking in a forest to meet Aspheera.) I returned the next day to fulfill my promise, but I exacted a promise from her in return.

'''Past Aspheera''': What promise?

'''Past Wu''': You must vow that you will never Spinjitzu for evil.

(Aspheera nods.)

'''Wu (Narrating)''': She gave her word and I trusted her. (Wu turns around and walks. Aspheera has a grim look on her face and follows.) Much to my regret. In the days and weeks that followed, I taught her the secret of Spinjitzu.

(Wu is shown teaching Aspheera how to do Spinjitzu. She attempts to do Spinjitzu but falls on the ground. Wu helps her up. She attempts to do Spinjitzu again and falls down. Wu helps her up again. Wu is shown about to eat a sandwich. Aspheera watches him and he gives it to her. He pulls out another one and eats it. Aspheera is shown training again, only this time doing Spinjitzu, but falling down. Wu positions her arms and she attempts to do it again and succeeds. She does spins again and knocks Wu over. She helps Wu up and they bow to each other. They both wave goodbye to each other and walk their separate ways. Garmadon rises up from a rock he's been hiding behind. Wu is about to enter his house.)

'''Past Garmadon''': Where have you been?

'''Past Wu''': N-Nowhere.

'''Past Garmadon''': Don't lie to me! I saw you! You were with that snake! You were teaching her Spinjitzu.

'''Past Wu''': I had to, Garmadon. We promised.

'''Past Garmadon''': You can't trust her. She's a slimy snake. (He lightly pushes Wu.)

'''Past Wu''': Don't call her that! (He pushes Garmadon back. Garmadon pushes him to the floor.) Ah! You...you hurt me!

(Garmadon runs off.)

'''Wu (Narrating)''': For weeks, we barely said a word to each other.

(Wu kicks a rock while walking. He sees a crowd of people leaving their lands.)

'''Past Wu''': What happened?!

'''Past villager''': King Mambo's been overthrown by a Serpentine queen who knows Spinjitzu! (He makes a punching motion.) She's marching on our lands! (He walks away.)

(Another villager speaks to Wu.)

'''Second past villager''': You better clear out while you can.

(Wu runs home. Wu opens a sliding door.)

'''Past Wu''': I...need your help.

'''Past Garmadon''': What is it?

'''Wu (Narrating)''': I told Garmadon what had happened and we put aside our anger. Together, we hoped to undo what we had done. But it meant disobeying my father a second time. (They walk into the room with the Scrolls of Forbidden Spinjitzu.)

'''Past Wu''': There! The Forbidden Scrolls!

(They both grab the scrolls. Wu's scroll lights up in a golden light, while Garmadon's in a purple light. Afterwards, [[Creation]] is shown rushing through Wu's body and [[Destruction]] is shown rushing through Garmadon's. It cuts to them trying out the scrolls in a forest. Wu raises his scroll and does Spinjitzu.)

'''Wu (Narrating)''': The scrolls gave us powers we have never felt before. It felt as if... (Garmadon does Spinjitzu.) we had reached our [[True Potential]] (Wu does Spinjitzu and hits a rock, cracking it in half.) in an instance. It was a wonderful feeling. And a terrible one. (It cuts to Garmadon and Wu behind bushes with the scrolls on their backs, attached to staffs. King Mambo is tied up in chains beside Aspheera.)

'''Past Aspheera''': (To the Hypnobrai.) Mambo V has failed you! The truce was broken. And what did he do? Nothing! He is weak. Weak! But I am not. Behold, the power of Spinjitzu! (Aspheera does Spinjitzu and knocks over Mambo. The Hypnobrai gasp, surprised. (Garmadon and Wu fight two guards and enter the Aspheera's pyramid.) (To Char.) Once [[Aspheera's rule over Ninjago|my rule over Ninjago]] is complete, I think I shall rename it, after myself. (Char pours a drink into a cup she is holding.)

'''Past Char''': "Asphago?"

'''Past Aspheera''': "Aspheera," you fool!

'''Past Char''': Ah! "Aspheera." Much better. (Nods) Mhmm!

'''Past Wu''': That's a terrible name!

'''Past Aspheera''': You!

'''Past Wu''': You broke your promise! You swore never to use Spinjitzu for evil!

'''Past Aspheera''': Is it evil to be strong? (A guard hands her a staff.) To show ambition? To push aside the weak and seize control? (She laughs.) Oh, Wu. You have much to learn about the ways of the world.

'''Past Wu''': I learned something from you. Never to trust a snake.

'''Past Aspheera''': Guards!

(Hypnobrai march toward the boys.)

'''Past Garmadon''': I'll handle these guys. You take care of her.

'''Past Aspheera''': 'Take care of me' if you can. (She points her staff at him.) Now that I know all of your secrets!

'''Past Wu''': You don't know all of them! (He pulls out the Scroll and Creation rushes through his body. Aspheera does Spinjitzu and Wu does Forbidden Spinjitzu. The tornadoes clash, sending Aspheera flying.)

'''Past Aspheera''': Ahh!

(They both spin and clash again. Knocking Aspheera over.)

'''Past Aspheera''': You deceived me! You promised to teach me Spinjitzu, but this...I have never seen!

'''Past Wu''': I didn't deceive you, I just didn't show you everything!

(Wu spins and hits her with his staff. They both spin and clash again Aspheera is knocked back. Wu spins and hits her again. He spins one last time and knocks Aspheera onto the ground.)

'''Past Aspheera''': Ahh! Oof.

(Garmadon finished defeating the Hypnobrai.)

'''Past Aspheera''': I yield! I yield! (Wu raises his staff. Aspheera shields her face with her arm. Wu stops and throws down his staff. Garmadon follows Wu and does the same.)

'''Past Wu (Narrating)''': And so Aspheera was defeated. The power of the scroll was too much, even for her sorcery. (Aspheera lays down, relieved.) King Mambo was restored to his rightful throne. (It cuts to Mambo V coming out of his pyramid. The Hypnobrai all cheer.) And the peace was kept. As for Aspheera...

(Wu is shown walking down a hallway with numerous cells in it.)

'''Past Aspheera''': Help me, Wu, please! As I helped you!

'''Past Wu''': King Mambo has decided your punishment. You are to be entombed, magically. Until such time as your sins are forgotten.

'''Past Aspheera''': Wu, I beg of you, release me!

'''Past Wu''': You would've brought war and suffering to all [[Ninjago]].

'''Past Aspheera''': I spared you and your brother! I ask only the same!

'''Past Wu''': (Shaking his head.) Ugh. (He walks away.)

'''Past Aspheera''': Release me! I saved you and you betray me?! You abandon me?! You-you... (She lunges at the cell door.) ...treacherous dog! You deceiver! (Wu and Garmadon walk away from the pyramid.) You will pay for this, Wu! DO YOU HEAR ME?! IF IT TAKES A THOUSAND YEARS! (Wu stops.) I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE! (Wu turns back and leaves.)
