'''[[Plundar]]''': I thought we lost this thing!

'''[[Korgran]]''': Plundar think wrong!

'''[[Cole]]''': No more thinking. Just run! (He sees some carts.) Everyone, into the carts!

'''[[Vania]]''': Are you sure these still work?

'''[[Wu]]''': I am forced to agree with the Princess, this looks rather old!

'''Cole''': Trust me, it'll work! Korgran, gimmie a hand! (They push the cart together.)

'''Plundar''': Time to go! All aboard! (They scream as they travel along the tracks.)

'''Cole''': I told you it would work! Whoo! That's what you call a good idea!

'''Vania''': We're going too fast!

'''Wu''': Hold on!

'''Cole''': (The cart tilts dangerously.) On that side! Quick! Oh, what kind of person would build a track like this?

'''[[Fungus]]''': I think I'm going to be sick.

'''Cole''': (The cart slows.) Whew. That was close. (The cart accelerates again.)

'''Korgran''': Down!

'''Cole''': Uh-oh.

'''Vania''': What, uh oh? (They smash through some gates and tumble onto the ground.)

'''Cole''': See? Another good idea.

'''Wu''': Is everyone alright?

'''Korgran''': Ugh. Korgran head hurt.

'''Plundar''': My whole body hurts.

'''Fungus''': Where are we?

'''Wu''': Cole? What is it?

'''Cole''': I don't know. I have a strange feeling about this place. (Several torches suddenly light up.)

'''Wu''': Hmm.

'''Cole''': What is it?

'''Wu''': It is the [[Old Tongue]]. The language in which my oldest scrolls are written.

'''Fungus''': What does it say?

'''Wu''': There's something about ... the heart of the [[Shintaro|mountain]]? "Let pass through here, into this refuge and sanctuary. Only those who are one with the Earth." Hmm, I wonder.

'''Korgran''': What means that?

'''Wu''': "The [[Heart of the Mountain]]" is the name of the legendary temple of the [[Elemental Masters|Masters]] of [[Earth]]. Some believe it was hidden in the mountains of Shintaro. But it has never been found.

'''Vania''': Oh, I know this story! It's in one of my books. ''[[Famous Places That I Will Find Before Anyone Else]]'', by [[Clutch Powers]].

'''Plundar''': What's inside? Treasure? Loot?

'''Wu''': Something even more precious.

'''Plundar''': Gemstones!

'''Wu''': The teachings of the "[[Spinjitzu Burst]]."

'''Fungus''': The what?

'''Wu''': It's a powerful force. Only an Elemental Master surrounded by his element can achieve it, it's mentioned in some of the earliest teachings of [[Spinjitzu]]. Your [[Lilly|mother]] sought to learn the Burst... but she never did.

'''Cole''': There's so much I never knew about her.

'''Plundar''': How do you open it?

'''Fungus''': Korgran, a little help. (Korgran slams into the door, but he only falls over.)

'''Wu''': If the legend is true, the doors will open only for those who are one with the Earth. An Earth Elemental.

'''Korgran''': It would be nice to tell Korgran before.

''(Cole hesitates, then activates the door and they enter the temple.)''

'''Fungus''': Whoa. Such beauty.

'''Wu''': We are looking upon something that few have ever seen.

'''Vania''': (Cole gasps when he sees a statue of his mother, then approaches it.) Who is it?

'''Wu''': Cole's mother, Lilly.

'''Fungus''': (He finds the [[Stone Mech]].) Look. Look at this!

'''Korgran''': What is it?

'''Wu''': A mech. But unlike any mech I've ever seen. It appears to be made of stone?

'''Fungus''': Perhaps the builders of this place used it to build the Temple.

'''Vania''': Do you think it still works?

'''Plundar''': (He climbs in.) There's no controls in this thing. Just a bunch of weird crystals. And this junk.

'''Cole''': (He reads from a sign.) "This statue was carved with love and gratitude by [[Geckles|Geckle]] and [[Munce]] craftsmen."

'''Wu''': Cole. (Elemental energy illuminates the ground, revealing a mural of Lilly.)

'''Cole''': Whoa. I guess she did learn how to do it.

'''Vania''': What's that light shining out of her?

'''Wu''': Elemental energy. Power. The power of the Earth itself.

'''Vania''': (gasps) Cole! You have to try it!

'''Cole''': Me? I - I - I can't. I don't know how!

'''Vania''': But you're an Earth Elemental. If you could learn the Spinjitzu Burst, you could use it against [[Vangelis|my father]] and free all those poor creatures working in the [[Mines of Shintaro|mines]].

'''Cole''': We don't even know for sure if my mother could do the Burst. What if it was the [[Blades of Deliverance]]?

'''Wu''': But we don't have the Blades, Cole. The Burst is our only chance. You have to try.

'''Cole''': Okay. Fine. But I'm not making any promises. Okay. Let's get this Spinjitzu Burst started. (He grunts and punches.) What do I do?

'''Wu''': You're asking me? I don't know.

'''Cole''': You're the Master.

'''Wu''': I know nothing of this kind of Spinjitzu. This is known only to Earth Elementals. You must open your mind. You must discover the truth within you.

'''Korgran''': Mm. Nothing is happen.

'''Wu''': Do you feel anything?

'''Cole''': Nothing.

'''Korgran''': Still nothing is happen.

'''Plundar''': No kidding.

'''Cole''': You guys mind? (He does Spinjitzu.) That wasn't the Burst, was it?

'''Wu''': No.

'''Cole''': Come on, you stupid mountain! Do something! Do something! (He slams the ground, which begins to shake.) Was that me?

'''Plundar''': Whatever it was, it shook the whole mountain!

'''Korgran''': Sound like thunder!

'''Fungus''': I must look into this. (He drops some mushrooms into his hat.)

'''Cole''': What's he doing?

'''Korgran''': Fungus magic.

'''Plundar''': He's making the pictures again.

'''Fungus''': I-It is not pictures. It is far-sight. I have discovered a special concoction of lichen and moss which reveal things that are happening far away. Observe! (He throws something into his hat, which releases blue smoke that forms images.)

'''Cole''': Hey!

'''Vania''': It's the other [[ninja]]!

'''Wu''': Where are they? What's happened to them?

'''Fungus''': Quiet. Watch.

'''Plundar''': They're in trouble!

'''Korgran''': They fight dragon?

'''Fungus''': It must be [[Grief-Bringer]].

'''Cole''': Grief-Bringer? The dragon from the picture with my mom? (The image of the Grief-Bringer blasts the ninja, which dispels the blue smoke.) We have to do something! We have to help!

'''Wu''': Against something so powerful, only the Spinjitzu Burst can prevail.

'''Cole''': Well, I can't do that! Ugh. Our friends are in trouble, and we're wasting time, stuck here in this - this useless temple! Argh!

'''Vania''': Master Wu? I hope you will forgive me saying this, but instead of standing around doing nothing, maybe you should be helping Cole.

'''Wu''': Excuse me?

'''Vania''': Cole needs you. And you're not doing anything to help.

'''Wu''': Cole is no longer a student! He is an accomplished ninja and an Elemental Master. He has not needed me in a long time.

'''Vania''': That's not how it looks to me.

'''Wu''': Hmm. (He follows Cole out of the temple.) On your feet, Cole.

'''Cole''': What's the point?

'''Wu''': We have work to do.

'''Cole''': I can't do it, Master Wu. I'm not my mother! I can't do the Burst, so unless you know how -

'''Wu''': I do not.

'''Cole''': Then we have to find some other way.

'''Wu''': (sighs) Vania is right.

'''Cole''': Vania?

'''Wu''': I have neglected my duties. What has been the principal lesson of all my teachings? I'm waiting.

'''Cole''': Ninja never quit.

'''Wu''': Exactly. Ninja never quit. And from this moment on, neither do Masters. They would never quit on us and we will never quit on them. Burst or not, we have a dragon to face!
