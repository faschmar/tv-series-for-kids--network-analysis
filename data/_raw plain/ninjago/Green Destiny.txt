''(In [[Ninjago]], the [[Sons of Garmadon]] are attacking [[Lloyd]], [[Nya]], and [[Dareth]].)''

'''Nya''': Get us out of here, Dareth!

'''Dareth''': I don't exactly have a free hand at the moment.

'''Lloyd''': Just keep swinging!

''(A vortex opens. Everyone gasps, looking up to see [[Dragons]] flying out''.)

'''[[Wu]]''': Break away!

'''[[Cole]]''': Our [[Ninjago City|city]]!

'''[[Jay]]''': What's left of it.

'''[[Kai]]''': Let's just hope our friends are okay. ''(Earpiece beeps.)''

'''Nya''': You're coming in loud and clear, brother.

'''Jay''': Nya?! Oh, you're alright.

'''Nya''': Oh... I don't know about that, but we could use a little help.

'''[[Zane]]''': I've located their transmission.

'''Wu''': Lead the way. ''(Zane leads the way, freezing most of the SoG members.)''

'''Dareth''': The [[ninja]] are back!

'''Nya''': And with very large dragons. ''(The rest of the SoG gang run away, screaming, while Kai, Jay, and Cole's dragons scare them off.)''

'''Lloyd''': ''(Laughing.)'' We did it! We held out! ''([[Firstbourne]] lands. Wu backflips on to the ground.)''

'''Nya''': Is that?

'''Lloyd''': Master Wu?

'''Wu''': When I was an old man, I was wise to avoid a fight. But today, I'm not an old man. ''(The ninja's dragons land.)''

'''Nya''': Yeah!

'''Lloyd, Nya, Kai, Jay, Zane, and Cole''': ''(They run up to each other, screaming with joy.)'' Yeah! Alright!

'''Cole''': Oh, look at us! The gang is back!

'''Zane''': But where are [[P.I.X.A.L.]] and [[Misako]]?

'''Lloyd''': Locked away in [[Kryptarium Prison|Kryptarium]]. ''(Dareth brings in [[Skylor]].)''

'''Kai''': Skylor! What happened?

'''Nya''': She tapped into [[Garmadon]]'s power. It was too much for her to bear.

'''Lloyd''': But I think we can save her, if we stop my father.

'''Wu''': Has your [[Energy|power]] returned?

'''Lloyd''': No, but [[Mystake]] taught me power isn't what makes the [[Green Ninja]]. It's the person behind the power.

'''Wu''': She's no longer with us, is she?

'''Dareth''': You know, we wouldn't be here without that crazy, little woman. In honor of her, I recommend we drop old-school and kick butt!

''(He throws a sword to Lloyd. Lloyd catches it. Garmadon continues to use the [[Colossus]] to destroy as many buildings as he can. People run away, screaming for their lives.)''

'''Lloyd''': Dareth is right. We do this for Mystake, and everyone else hurt by my father.

'''Wu''': Ninja, can you stop the Colossus?

'''Cole''': We've learned a thing or two about taking down giants. ''(Kai, Jay, Zane, and Cole run to their dragons.)''

'''Wu''': Nya, you and Dareth, keep Skylor safe. Lloyd... you must confront your father.

'''Lloyd''': I've survived without my power, but I don't know if I can stop him.

'''Wu''': You may be without power, but you are not without me.

'''Lloyd''': ''(Raises arm.)'' Ninja!

'''Kai, Jay, Zane, and Cole''': ''(Raise their chains.)'' Go!

'''Dareth''': See you on the other side. ''(He closes entrance port to [[Battle Wagon]].)''

''(On the ride, Wu winces in pain.)''

'''Lloyd''': What's wrong?

'''Wu''': My brother. I feel his rage.

'''Garmadon''': I feel you, brother. I see you brought the ninja, but it's too late. Feel the wrath, of my [[True Potential]]!

'''Kai''': Looks like there's a few more who are unable to evacuate.

'''Jay''': [[Great Devourer|Giant snakes]], [[The Overlord|overlords]], and now [[Fall of Ninjago|this]]? Why do people insist on living in this city?

'''Cole''': Because old friends are worth fighting for! ''(A car is stopped by broken road parts on the road. Jay's [[Stormbringer|Dragon]] picks up the car, carrying it.)''

'''Jay''': I know. The commute is terrible. ''(Zane sees people waiting to cross a broken gap in the road. Zane's [[Ice Dragon (Realm of Oni and Dragons)|Dragon]] connects the road with ice.)''

'''People''': ''(Cheer.)'' Yeah! ''(They slide on the ice.)''

'''[[Rufus McCallister|Rufus]]''': ''(He screams as a piece of road is about to crush him. Kai fires his chain at him, carrying him to safety. He drops him off.)'' Super heroes do exist.

''(The battle wagon passes by the SoG making fun of [[Gayle Gossip]].)''

'''Gayle''': Whatever happened to freedom of the press? ''(Cawing sounds draw everyone's attention away.)''

'''Dareth''': ''(Leaps into view.)'' Aha! When you mess with Gayle Gossip, you mess with... the Brown Ninja.

'''SoG Member''': You hear that, fellas? The Brown Ninja made a mess! ''(The rest of them burst out into laughter.)''

'''Dareth''': Huh? What? No, no, no, that's not what Iâ€”No! That is gross, you twisted my words. Laugh all you want. It's time to wipe out crime! ''(The SoG toughen up, walking towards Dareth. Dareth trips over a stone while confronting them but takes all the SoG members out. The battle wagon rolls back in. Dareth turns to [[Vinny Folson|Vinny]].)'' Please tell me you got that. ''(Dareth walks backwards towards the battle wagon.)''

'''Gayle''': Hey, wait! Who are you?

'''Dareth''': Heh. Your biggest fan. ''(He belly flops into the battle wagon. Gayle Gossip sighs and faints.)''
----''([[Chopper Maroon]] returns to Kryptarium Prison to alert the rest of the SoG.)''

'''Chopper Maroon''': The ninja! They're back. The boss needs all hands on deck!

'''Misako''': The ninja!

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': They've returned?

'''[[Ronin]]''': Well, I'll be.

'''[[Karlof]]''': They need our help. [[The Resistance]] never quits! ''(He starts banging the bars with his metal fist.)'' The Resistance never quits!

'''Ronin''': The Resistance never quits!

'''Everyone in Prison''': ''(Bangs on bars.)'' The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! ''(Ronin helps Karlof take down the bars.)'' The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! ''(Karlof delivers the last blow on the bars. Others continue chanting in the background. The SoG gang runs up to Karlof. Karlof bounces them back with his metal power. Ronin and [[Griffin Turner]] come to his side.)''

'''The Resistance''': The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits!

'''Ronin''': ''(Simultaneously.)'' You ain't got the [[Vengestone]] to protect you now. ''(Griffin Turner speeds up the tower and pushes a button, opening all the gates.)''

'''The Resistance''': The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits!
----''(Firstbourne is flying Master Wu and Lloyd towards [[Borg Tower]].)''

'''Lloyd''': Tell me you know how to defeat him.

'''Wu''': Only a fool thinks he knows everything. I admit I know nothing! How this will end, is beyond me.

''(Kai, Jay, Zane, and Cole have reached the Colossus.)''

'''Cole''': Okay, we got the people out of the way. Time to deal with the elephant in the roof!

'''Zane''': That is not an elephant, Cole.

'''Kai''': We got it, Zane. Just train your chain on the big guy. Remember what [[Faith]] taught us. We do this together.

'''Jay''': The bigger they are, the harder they fall!

''(Firstbourne drops Master Wu and Lloyd off, and flies off. Lloyd spots a purple light and Master Wu nods, giving the signal to go up.)''

'''Garmadon''': ''(Echoing.)'' My family. ''(Lloyd and Master Wu immediately stop and hold up their weapons.)'' My enemies. You may have [[First Spinjitzu Master|Father]]'s [[Dragonbone Blade|sword]], but now my power will surpass his. ''(Slow-mo of Master Wu and Lloyd turning towards Garmadon's dramatic entrance. Garmadon lands, opening his eyes. Master Wu and Lloyd take a fighting stance. Garmadon uses his power to create his own four [[destruction daggers]].)''

''(A fight breaks out between Lloyd, Wu, and Garmadon.)''

'''Wu''': What have you become?!

'''Garmadon''': Time has treated you well. You think Father's sword can hurt me?

'''Wu''': ''(Grunts.)'' No. But it can ''hold'' you!

''(Lloyd jumps down to join the fight, but Firstbourne dramatically raises her head. Master Wu drops his sword and backs away. Firstbourne sprays out her fire at Garmadon, who slowly absorbs the power to fuel himself.)''

'''Garmadon''': Don't you get it?! ''(He conjures his power again.)'' The fight is what fuels me!

'''Wu''': Lloyd, take cover! ''(Lloyd and Master Wu run for cover. Garmadon blasts Master Wu and Firstbourne from the tower with his power.)''

'''Cole''': ''(Looking at the tower.)'' What was that?

'''Kai''': Look out! ''(The Colossus punches Cole. Firstbourne catches Master Wu while he is falling.)''

'''Wu''': ''(Gasps.)'' Lloyd.

''(Atop the tower, Lloyd has managed to grab on to the edge of the roof.)''

'''Garmadon''': ''(Mockingly.)'' Hello, son. And farewell. How long can you endure?

'''Lloyd''': I thought the fight is what fueled you. Is this how you fight?

'''Garmadon''': ''(He picks Lloyd up and throws him to the ground, then picks up the Dragonbone Blade.)'' If only Father could see me now.

''(A fight commences between Lloyd and Garmadon. Meanwhile, the ninja continue to try to chain the Colossus down.)''

'''Zane''': He's too considerable to take down.

'''Kai''': And he's got good reflexes!

'''Cole''': Guys, I'm nearly out of chain.

'''Jay''': Me too.

'''Kai''': Even if we had more, it's not thick enough to stop it.

'''Zane''': Then perhaps next time we should use thicker chains.

'''Cole''': There ain't gonna be a next time!

'''Jay''': And Zane's the smart one.

'''Kai''': No, he's onto something. Look at all that chain. If we can use it, we could lock it down.

'''Cole''': And who of us is stupid enough to jump on that thing?

'''Kai''': Cole, say no more. ''(He jumps on the Colossus.)''

'''Cole''': That's my last one. ''(He uses the chain.)'' Make it count!

''(Lloyd dodges one of Garmadon's attacks.)''

'''Lloyd''': This isn't what your father wanted Ninjago to be. He left his world to make a better place. He fought to restore the balance!

'''Garmadon''': Ninjago isn't built on balance! It's built on... power! And controlled by he who possesses it!

'''Lloyd''': ''(He knocks the Dragonbone Blade out of Garmadon's hands and switches his sword for it.)'' No matter what you've done, or what you've become, I have to believe this isn't you. You can change!

'''Garmadon''': Youthful ignorance! People don't change. They only reveal who they truly are!

'''Lloyd''': You're wrong! ''(Garmadon strikes the sword out of Lloyd's hands. The sword goes flying off the building.)''

'''Garmadon''': Get up and fight me. Get up! Fight me!

'''Lloyd''': No. It's the fight that fuels you. I can not fight you... but I can resist you. ''(He dodges his attacks.)''

'''Kai''': Keep distracting it!

'''Lloyd''': I can not fight you, but I can resist you.

'''Garmadon''': Stop saying that!

'''Lloyd''': I can not fight you, but I can resist you. I can not fight you, but I can resist you!

'''Jay''': It's working! Get off of there, Kai! ''(The Colossus falls over; the ninja cheer. But it starts to get up.)''

'''Cole''': It's breaking free!

'''Zane''': It is weakened.

'''Cole''': It didn't fall hard enough.

'''Kai''': Oh, come on!

'''Wu''': Maybe I can offer some metal!

'''Nya''': I hope you didn't think we forgot about you.

'''Kai''': Hey!

'''Misako''': Tie it down!

'''Cole''': Here we go again. The bigger they are...

'''Zane''': ... the harder they fall!

''(Garmadon's powers weaken.)''

'''Lloyd''': I can not fight you, but I can resist you. ''(Garmadon's powers disappear.)''

'''Garmadon''': My power... where is it?

''(Lloyd's power returns and the Colossus starts to crumble. Skylor wakes up.)''

'''Skylor''': ''(Coughs.)'' What happened?

'''Kai''': We won.

'''Garmadon''': You still have to finish it.

'''Lloyd''': It's over.

'''Garmadon''': It's not over. But when they come, it will be. My power... It was the only thing that could battle back the [[Darkness (Oni)|darkness]] from devouring us all. But you took that away. And now everything will be gone.

'''Lloyd''': Who will come?

'''Garmadon''': You'll see. And when they come, nothing will be left.

(The Sons of Garmadon are being arrested.)

'''[[Police Commissioner|Commissioner]]''': Well, I hope you scum took care of Kryptarium. I know some cells that have opened up.

'''Lloyd''': Do you have room for one more? ''(The police run towards Garmadon.)''

'''Kai''': Lloyd!

'''Jay''': Man! I can't believe it! Oh, yeah!

'''Nya''': Your power is back!

'''Jay''': And Garmadon's power is gone. The balance is restored.

'''Commissioner''': Thank you, ninja, for saving Ninjago. Again.

'''Garmadon''': They will come!

'''Kai''': Just another day in Ninjago. I wonder what tomorrow holds?

'''Jay''': It holds a lot of work, Kai.
----''(The ninja are seen cleaning up the [[Royal Palace]].)''

'''Cole''': We saved Ninjago. Can't we get a day off?

'''Lloyd''': We helped break it, we help rebuild it.

'''Wu''': Ninja! Trouble! ''(They see him as an old man again.)'' Come quick!

'''Kai''': Already?

'''Jay''': I'm still sore from our last adventure. ''(Wu leads them outside, where everyone is celebrating.)''

'''[[The Weekend Whip|Music]]''': ''Go!''

'''Commissioner''': I already thanked you, but the people want to thank you also.

'''[[The Fold (characters)|The Fold]]''': ''It's time for training and we're getting started. It's on, you know. And we wanna see you whip and shout it. We rock, you roll! They say, go slow. And everything just stands so still. We say go, go. We're ready for the fight, we know the drill. Monday morning and we feel defeated, seems so long ago...''
----''(Lloyd finds Wu tending to Firstbourne.)''

'''Lloyd''': She has to leave?

'''Wu''': This isn't their realm. She'll come back, when it's time. Right now, they need to return home. Thank you, my friend.

'''Lloyd''': The First Spinjitzu Master tried to make the perfect realm, and because of my father, there may never be lasting peace.

'''Wu''': Our world isn't perfect, but that doesn't mean we give up on it.

'''Lloyd''': Tell me, Master. Back in the [[Realm of Oni and Dragons|First Realm]], did you see the [[Oni]]?

'''Wu''': They were all gone when we arrived. To where, I do not know. What concerns you, Master Lloyd?

'''Lloyd''': If my father is right, I think they are coming.
