'''[[Lloyd]]''': Nice to meet you, [[Okino]]. That's [[Cole]], [[Kai]], [[Nya]], and [[Jay]].

''(Lloyd gestures to each of the [[ninja]].)''

'''Okino'''' I am honored. Allow me humbly to pledge my service.

''(Okino bows, offering his sword.)''

'''Nya''': Oh, gee, that's really not-

'''Okino''': I, Okino, samurai, pledge to serve you, and do all in my power to protect you and guide you to the [[Key-Tanas|Key-Tana]].

''(Okino bows on one knee.)''

'''Lloyd''': Thanks, Okino. That's-

'''Kai''': Just out of curiosity, when you said you failed all your previous masters, how many are we talking here? Two? Three?

'''Nya''': (whispers) Kai...

'''Kai''': What? I can ask that, can't I?

'''Okino''': (sigh)

''(Okino gestures to the large amount of swords in the ground.)''

'''Jay''': Oh... Yeah...

'''Lloyd''': Okay, so a few. But this time will be different. Right, Okino?

'''Okino''': Yes, I swear it.

'''Lloyd''': Lead on, Okino. We trust you.

''(Okino picks up his sword.)''

'''Okino''': This way. Into the [[Forest of Discontent]]. And then beyond, past the [[Cliffs of Hysteria]]. And finally, the [[Maze of the Red Dragon]].

''(Okino and the ninja head into the Forest of Discontent. When the enter, they stop.)''

'''Kai''': Forest of Discontent? Why do they call it that?

''(Spikes start shooting out of the nearby bushes. Okino blocks them with his sword.)''

'''Cole''': What was that?

'''Okino''': Thorns of Discontent.

'''Lloyd''': It came from those bushes.

''(Lloyd pulls out his weapon.)''

'''Lloyd''': Let's spread out. Six targets are harder to hit than one.

'''Cole''': Good idea. I got the bush in the middle.

''(Cole pulls out his weapon and his mask comes on.)''

'''Nya''': I'll take the one on the left.

''(Nya pulls out her weapon and her mask comes on.)''

'''Jay''': I'll take the one on the right.

''(Jay pulls out his weapon.)''

'''Kai''': I'll hang back and make sure no bushes are following us.

''(Kai pulls out his weapon. Everyone looks at Kai.)''

'''Kai''': What? I have one life left, remember?

'''Lloyd''': Okay. On three.

''(Lloyd's mask comes on.)''

'''Lloyd''': One, two, three!

''(Kai's mask comes on. The ninja run to the bushes to attack.)''

'''Jay''': Ninja versus Bushes! Attack!

''(Thorns of Discontent start shooting from the bushes. The ninja dodge them and slice them with their weapons. They deflect the thorns with their weapons and destroy the bushes.)''

''(Cole's mask comes off.)''

'''Cole''': Wow! These new weapons are really awesome! That was-

''(A Thorn of Discontent hits Cole in the back.)''

'''Cole''': Ahhhhhhh!

''(Cole regenerates behind Okino.)''

'''Cole''': Ahhhhh! It got me!

''One of Cole's [[Health boards|lives]] disappears. ''

'''Cole''': It got me! Aww, I just lost a life.

''(Everyone's masks come off.)''

'''Okino''': You must be careful. In this place, all things, any flower, tree, or beast, seek to [[Death|destroy]] you. Even the ground beneath cannot be trusted.

''(The ninja continue on. Later on, the Forest of Discontent is completely dark.)''

'''Cole''': Wow, it's dark in here!

'''Jay''': Hang on a sec.

''(Jay opens up his pause menu and generates two torches.)''

'''Jay''': There, that's better.

''(He passes one to Cole. Cole turns his on to reveal a huge flower with teeth.)''

'''Cole''': Great. Now I can see what I'm looking at, and it's even worse!

''(The ninja continue on.)''

'''Nya''': So tell us about the [[Purple Key-Tana|Key-Tana]], Okino. You said it's in a maze?

'''Okino''': Hai. Guarded by a fearsome beast. A [[Blue Dragon|dragon]].

''(The ninja look at each other, less than impressed by this.)''

'''Lloyd''': We've faced plenty of [[dragons]] before.

'''Okino''': Not like this one. They say its teeth can rend any armor, its breath can melt steel, and its scales are impervious to even the sharpest blades!

''(The ninja continue on. Nya hops over a tree root into a puddle of quick sand with teeth. She screams, and Okino looks back at her. Jay and Cole rush to help her.)''

'''Jay''': Nya!

'''Cole''': Hang on!

''(Nya sinks lower into the sand, and Cole and Jay lose their grip.)''

'''Nya''': Get me out of here!

''(Nya is completely swallowed by the quicksand, and regenerates next to Lloyd.)''

'''Lloyd''': What the heck was that?

'''Okino''': [[Swamp-teeth]].

'''Nya''': Swamp- teeth!?

'''Okino''': Even the ground cannot be trusted.

'''Nya''': I'll say one thing. [[Milton Dyer]] has a twisted imagination!

''(The ninja continue on. They come across a cavern with vines hanging above it. Okino stops them.)''

'''Lloyd''': What is it?

'''Okino''': Those vines. I think they are Strangler Vines.

'''Jay''': I don't like the sound of that.

'''Lloyd''': Strangler Vines? Great.

'''Kai''': Lloyd, you should check it out. It's your turn! Look, I already lost three lives, and Cole got hit by thorns, a-and Nya fell into the hole-

'''Lloyd''': Okay, okay.

''(Lloyd pulls out his sword and continues to the vines. He slices one and nothing happens.)''

'''Lloyd''': They're just normal vines-

''(A figure tackles Lloyd. Lloyd kicks him off of him. The figure slams into a rock and starts scratching himself furiously. Everyone grabs their weapons as their masks come on and advance toward the stranger. More [[Whack Rats|enemies]] appear from the trees. One throws a bomb near them. The enemies appear to be rats. The rats come down from the trees and attack the ninja. The ninja fight them, and the rats run off, scratching themselves.)''

'''Cole''': What were those things?

''(Nya has tied up one of the rats with a vine.)''

'''Nya''': Lloyd, are you okay?

'''Lloyd''': I'm fine.

''(Lloyd walks over to the rat.)''

'''Lloyd''': Who are you?

'''[[Ritchie]]''': I am from the Brotherhood of Rats, and I am sworn to silence. Do your worst, you'll get nothing out of me, nothing!

'''Lloyd''': So, you're working for [[Unagami]]?

'''Ritchie''': You're trying to trick me into giving away that Unagami ordered us to ambush you. Well, it won't work!

'''Cole''': (To Jay) Yeah, he's not the brightest, is he?

'''Jay''': So Unagami's cheating. To make sure we don't win the game!

'''Nya''': Oh, that makes me mad!

'''Okino''': Uh, game?

'''Cole''': Yeah. Prime Empire? Oh, wait. You're an NPC. You're part of the game. Nevermind.

'''Okino''': What...game?

'''Lloyd''': Okino, I know it's hard to believe, but this world, the forest, the traps, all of it, it's. . . it's just. . . it's only a game, Okino. It's not real. We're all stuck inside a game, and Unagami is the guy calling the shots. He's the one who made this whole place.

'''Okino''': (Laughs) Game! You are testing Okino! You think I am so easily fooled? Ha ha!

'''Kai''':No, Okino, we're telling the truth.

'''Jay''': Uh, he's not programmed to understand that kind of stuff, Kai. He's part of the game.

'''Okino''': Hahahahahaha! Game.

'''Nya''': So what do we do?

'''Lloyd''': This doesn't change anything. We already knew Unagami was trying to stop us. Now we know he's playing dirty. Let's keep moving!

'''Ritchie''': (Struggles) Oh no! No no no no no! I got an itch! You gotta help! You gotta do something! You gotta, you gotta scratch it!

'''Lloyd''': Give me one reason I should!

'''Ritchie''': Ooh, ooh, okay, okay, I can help! I know a glitch!

'''Nya''': A what?

'''Ritchie''': A glitch! A glitch in the game! A shortcut! Oh geez, it itches, to get past the forest! Oh come on, you gotta help! You gotta cut me down! Oh, get it!

'''Cole''': Huh. What do you think?

'''Lloyd''': He could be telling the truth. Games have glitches sometimes.

'''Jay''': Oh yeah! Like ''Fist to Face''! Remember that game? Where you can step right through the wall?

'''Kai''': If he's telling the truth, this could save us a lot of time.

'''Okino''': What means this word, glitch?

'''Jay''':Um, it's hard to explain.

'''Lloyd''': If we let you down, will you have to promise to lead us to the glitch.

'''Ritchie''': Ooh hoo hoo, yes! Yes, I promise! Just get me down! Come on, come on, let me down!

''(Lloyd pulls out his sword and cuts the vine. Ritchie immediately starts scratching the itch furiously.)''

'''Ritchie''': Ah, ah, that's it right there! Ah...

''(The ninja continue on with Ritchie, leading them to the glitch.)''

'''Ritchie''': Come on! This way! Hurry!

'''Nya''': You sure this is a good idea?

'''Lloyd''': What do we have to lose?

'''Ritchie''': There. See it?

''(Ritchie points to a glitch near a large rock. The ninja approach it.)''

'''Ritchie''': That's it. Jump in. Like this.

''(Ritchie jumps into the glitch and disappears.)''

'''Okino''': What devilry?

'''Lloyd''': It's okay Okino. You don't have to follow us. This is the glitch. We can go it alone from here.

''(The ninja run into the glitch and disappear as well. They are transported into a purple room with purple blocks scattered around it, some floating, some in the ground. Soon after, [[Red Visors]] appear with their guns, ready to attack. Ritchie can be seen hiding behind one of the blocks.)''

'''Lloyd''': Look out! It's a trap!

''(The ninja draw their weapons and their masks turn on. They are now surrounded by Red Visors. The Red Visors begin to shoot at them. They block the shots with their weapons.)''

'''Ritchie''': Ha ha! Suckers! Long live [[Atta the Ratta]]!

''(Ritchie runs back into the glitch.)''

'''Cole''': You lousy rat!

''(Cole gets shot and regenerates. The Red Visors continue their attack. Both Lloyd and Jay get hit. The ninja continue to deflect the laser shots with their weapons, hitting some of the Red Visors. Jay gets hit again.)''

'''Nya''': Lloyd! There's too many!

''(Both Nya and Lloyd get shot and regenerate.)''

'''Okino''': Hi-ya!

''(Okino comes into the fight, hitting some Red Visors with his sword.)''

'''Nya''': Okino!

'''Okino''': Go! I will hold them off!

'''Lloyd''': After the rat!

''(With less Red Visors surrounding them now, Lloyd and the rest of the ninja manage to break away from the fight.)''

'''Red Visor''': Patch the glitch!

'''Kai''': No!

''(The ninja run through the glitch, but Lloyd stays behind. He watches Okino fight.)''

'''Lloyd''': Okino! Come on!

'''Okino''': Go! Save yourselves!

'''Lloyd''': Okino! I'm not leaving without you. Now run!

''(Okino runs towards the glitch. He pushes Lloyd in right before it's patched. The ninja appear to be at the exit of the Forest of Discontent.)''

'''Kai''': Ugh-we made it. We actually made it!

''(The ninja cheer. Lloyd looks back to see Okino with his back turned to the ninja, kneeling on the ground.)''

'''Lloyd''': Okino. Thank you. You saved our lives back there.

'''Cole''': Uh, most of our lives.

'''Lloyd''': Are you okay Okino?

'''Okino''': You told me the truth. This world, my world, is a glitch?

'''Lloyd''': A game. Yes.

'''Okino''': And I am part of it. A pawn.

'''Lloyd''': No. If you were just a pawn you wouldn't have helped us. You decided to save our lives. You made that decision, not Unagami. Okino, we wouldn't have made it without you!

'''Okino''': If I cannot trust in what I see, in what I believe, what should I trust?

'''Lloyd''': You're a good person, Okino. How about you trust in yourself? And in your friends?

'''Okino''': My friends?

'''Jay''': Yeah. Us.

''(Jay offers his hand to Okino to help him up. Okino takes it and gets up.)''

'''Jay''': Because we're gonna to need all the help we can get.

''(The ninja show how many lives they have.)''
