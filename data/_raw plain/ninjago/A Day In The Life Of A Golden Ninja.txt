'''Narrator:''' An exciting day in the life a golden ninja. Let's peek in, shall we?

''(The golden ninja and his [[pet dragon]] are asleep. An alarm clock in the form of a gong rings, which the golden ninja turns off with a shuriken.)''

'''Narrator:''' Wakey, wakey!

''(The golden ninja gets out of bed. The pet dragon laughs upon seeing the golden ninja in his underwear.)''

'''Narrator:''' Oh, my! Here, let me help you with that. You've got the gi and the sword. You've got the dragon sidekick. You must be a golden ninja, right? Well then, you must be ready for a day of amazing ninja adventure! Running off into the thick of the action, saving the innocent, and battling evil... But wait! Aren't you forgetting something? No, not that! But try again. Not even close. Beautiful voice! But no. No, but thank you for that. That's not it either. A ninja must always do their chores before running off to playâ€”uh, I mean, protect the realm. First up, feed the fish. Oh come on, it'll be fun! Good job, but where are all the fish? Dragon! Open your mouth, please. Well done, gentlemen! Up next, the garden. No big deal, you just need to pull out a few little weeds. Uh, are you still with us, little buddy? Outstanding! Now let's sweep up those ashes. I'll just pretend I didn't see that for now. Congratulation, you're almost done! Just a few more easy-peasy household chores, and you'll be ready for adventure! Here's the list. Wash the dishes! Iron your gis! Clean the bathroom! Ooh, be careful in there, little friend! Clean out your refrigerator. Scrub the floor. Uh, hello? They wouldn't... They did! ''Ahem.'' Back to it please, gentlemen! Scrub the floor! Ooh, so graceful! Polish the gong. Tidy up the living room. Change the light bulb in the guest room. Chop the firewood. Do the laundry. Paint the rec room, wax the floors, wash the ceilings, polish the banister, clean the sun(?) room. You missed a spot! More elbow grease, please! Faster! Cleaner! (''Narrator laughs.)'' Well, how did it go, gentlemen? Beautiful! Ooh, so shiny! Absolutely fabulous job, gentlemen. It's finally time for adventure. Oh dear. Aren't they just adorable though? Oh well, I suppose there's always tomorrow. Just another exciting day in the life a golden ninja!
