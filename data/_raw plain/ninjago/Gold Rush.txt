''(Kai and Nya drive through [[Ninjago City]].)'' 

'''[[Kai]]:''' I can't believe you broke it!

'''[[Nya]]:''' I broke it?! You broke it!

'''Kai:''' Uh, [[Cyrus Borg|Dr. Borg]] can fix it.

'''Nya:''' If we get there.

'''Kai:''' This is why I never let you drive!

'''Nya:''' But I am the better driver. 

'''Kai:''' It's my [[Prototype X-1|car]]!

'''Cyrus Borg:''' Nya, Kai, where are you? 

'''Nya:''' We are on our way, Dr. Borg.

'''Cyrus Borg:''' According to my calculations, the [[shadow banshees]] will overtake Ninjago City in less than, uh, five minutes! Is the [[Idol of Unity]] safe?

'''Kai:''' Uh, more or less?

'''Cyrus Borg:''' Good. When you get it, place the idol on the beacon. Its power should destroy the shadow banshees.

'''Nya:''' Hope you are right, Dr. Borg. ''(To Kai.)'' We have to tell him eventually. ''(Kai shoots at the shadow banshees.)'' Not even a scratch.

'''Kai:''' You think you can do it better?

'''Nya:''' Watch me!

'''Kai:''' That's my bike!

'''Nya:''' ''(Nya kicks a shadow banshee.)'' Uh, what gives?

'''Kai:''' We just have to outrun them.

'''Nya:''' Then I'll see you at the [[Borg Tower|tower]], slowpoke.

'''Kai:''' Almost there!

'''Nya:''' Not fast enough, bro. ''(A shadow banshee wraps itself around Borg Tower, creating black smoke. Kai and Nya try to stop their vehicles, but crash. They reach for the Idol of Unity, and is surrounded by the smoke.)''

'''Kai:''' Nya?

'''Nya:''' Kai?

'''Kai:''' Nya?!

'''Nya:''' Kai?!

'''Kai:''' Nya!

'''Nya:''' Kai! I thought I lost you.

'''Kai:''' At least we are together now.

'''Nya:''' What do we do now? ''(They hug. The idol of Unity starts to glow.)''

'''Kai:''' Wait a second!

'''Nya:''' The idol...

'''Kai:''' ...of...

'''Kai and Nya:''' ...unity! ''(They combine their pieces, which turns their outfits gold. They remake the Prototype X-1.)''

'''Kai:''' Yes! ''(They hop inside.)'' Ninja, Go! ''(The car flies into the air.)''

'''Nya:''' Come on, bro. Let's go to save Ninjago City! ''(She uses her swords and cuts the shadow banshee.)''

'''Kai:''' Now! ''(Nya launches herself to the top of Borg Tower, where she places the idol on the beacon. A gold light erupts, destroying all of the shadow banshees.)''

'''Cyrus Borg:''' You did it!

'''Kai:''' I knew I can do it.

'''Nya:''' I made a flying car.

'''Kai:''' Hey, I was the one who did that.

'''Nya:''' What?!

'''Cyrus Borg:''' That, you both saved the day.

'''Kai and Nya:''' Exactly!

'''Kai:''' ''(Kai and Nya drive off into the distance.)'' You know, you really should have let me drive.

'''Nya:''' Is there a banana in your hair?
