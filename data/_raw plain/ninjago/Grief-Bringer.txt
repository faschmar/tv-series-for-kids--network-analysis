}}''(In the [[Munce Home-Cave]], the [[Munce]] are in an uproar.)''

'''Munce''': Not good! Not good idea at all!

'''Munce''': Is bad idea!

'''Munce''': Truce meeting with [[Geckles]] is trap! Tricky Geckle trap!

'''[[Jay]]''': Guys, it's not a trap! The Geckles aren't your enemies!

'''[[Lloyd]]''': The [[Vangelis|Skull Sorcerer]] is your enemy, and the only chance we have to defeat them is to work together! (The Munce continue fighting.)

'''[[Nya]]''': It's no use, they're not listening.

'''[[Murtessa]]''': You must make them listen.

'''Nya''': Oh, it's you.

'''Jay''': Nya. Be nice.

'''Nya''': She attacked me with a giant [[Spiked clubs|spiked club]], Jay. Remember?

'''Jay''': Yeah, but if you hold every little thing against a person, you won't make any friends at all.

'''Nya''': (sighs) Make them listen how?

'''Murtessa''': Munce are proud. Strong. They respect only power.

'''Nya''': Hmm. (She uses [[Water]] to get their attention.) Alright, you Munce. Listen up! We ''are'' going to that truce meeting, and there ''will'' be peace! If I have to fight every last one of you! Is that clear? (The Munce agree.) Good. Now, let's get this show on the road.

''(In the [[Geckle Strong-Cave]], the Geckles are arguing as well.)''

'''[[Groko]]''': This meeting is a trap! A treacherous Munce ambush!

'''[[Garpo]]''': Hear, hear!

'''[[Ginkle]]''': I propose we ambush ''them''!

'''[[Kai]]''': Order! Order in the court.

'''[[Zane]]''': I do not believe they're listening.

'''Kai''': Ugh. (He uses [[Fire]] to get the Geckles' attention.) Thank you. Now, I propose that we trust the new Munce Queen, whoever she is, and go to the truce meeting.

'''Zane''': (He throws a pebble at Kai's head.) Hear, hear. (Kai frowns at him.) I am attempting to follow Geckle Parliamentary procedures.

'''Groko''': What if you're wrong?

'''Ginkle''': Yeah, how do you know?

'''[[Gulch]]''': We could settle the matter by [[Slugs|slug]].

'''Kai''': How do you settle a matter by slug?

''("Slug" turns out to be a [[slug race]].)''

'''Gulch''': On your mark, get set... slow!

'''Geckle''': Oh, Brown! You can do it!

'''Garpo''': Go go go! Brown for the win!

'''Zane''': What is the purpose of this?

'''Gulch''': It's simple. If the gray slug wins, you're right, and the Munce can be trusted. If the brown slug wins, you're wrong, and the Munce cannot be trusted. Only the slugs know.

'''[[Gleck]]''': Please! I am Gleck! I must speak to you most urgently! (He takes them out of the other Geckles' sight.) I believe you! I do not think the Munce are evil. I do not think they stole our [[Ivory Blade of Deliverance|blade]]. But nobody listens to me. (Kai notices his [[Lilly's necklace|necklace]].) I'm only Gleck.

'''Kai''': Okay, uh, Gleck, don't take this the wrong way, but you're the little purple creature [[Cole]] saw in the [[Palace (Shintaro)|palace]], aren't you?

'''Gleck''': Yes. I did not mean to scare him. I was looking for [[Lilly|Gilly]]. I heard that the [[Elemental Masters|Elemental Master]] of [[Earth]] was invited to Shintaro. But I was wrong.

'''Zane''': Gleck, may I see your necklace?

'''Gleck''': Will you give it back? It is my most prized possession! Given to me by Gilly, herself!

'''Zane''': Of course, I promise. (Gleck hands him the locket.)

'''Kai''': Hey! Those are Cole's parents, [[Lou]], and - and - ugh, what's his mom's name again?

'''Zane''': Lilly.

'''Kai and Zane''': (gasp) Lilly is Gilly!

'''Gleck''': You - you know her? Oh, joyous news! Will you tell her the Geckles need her help again? Please?

'''Kai''': Ah, Gleck, I'm not sure how to say this, but... the woman you called Gilly... passed away a while ago. (Gleck's lips tremble at the news.) I'm sorry.

'''[[Hazza D'ur]]''': A meeting between Munce and Geckles! They plan a truce! The disobedient voices resonate through the [[Shintaro Mountain|mountain]].

'''[[Vangelis]]''': What? Who is to blame for this?

'''Hazza D'ur''': The [[ninja]]. They yet live. You know what must be done. (Vangelis transforms into the Skull Sorcerer and flies down to [[The Pit (Shintaro)|the Pit]], to a tomb guarded by [[Re-Awakened]].) Wake up, spawn.

'''Skull Sorcerer''': Open it! (The Awakened Warriors open the tomb) Bring the bones back to life, Hazza D'ur! Bring back [[Grief-Bringer]]!

'''Hazza D'ur''': Rise. Rise! (The Grief-Bringer comes back to life.)

'''Gleck''': Oh no! The Brown Slug is winning. That means the Munce cannot be trusted.

'''Kai''': We have to do something, Zane. Use your [[Ice|powers]]. Make an ice-slick for the grey slug!

'''Zane''': That would be cheating.

'''Kai''': It's not cheating, Zane, it's a white lie.

'''Zane''': A white lie?

'''Kai''': Yeah, it means we're doing it for a good reason. To stop a war, to defeat the Skull Sorcerer. (The brown slug is almost past the finish line.) Oh, no.

'''Zane''': You are implying that a lie can be good if done for a good reason? I do not accept that supposition.

'''Kai''': Ugh. Zane, what about [[The Explorers Club|the time you impersonated]] [[Clutch Powers]] to get into the [[Explorer's Club]]?

'''Zane''': Clutch Powers was hospitalized and unable to go himself. It was necessary.

'''Kai''': Right! We did it because we had to. Because there was no other way! Argh, we're running out of time. Ugh. It's over. It's all over.

'''Zane''': Very well. I accept the necessity of a white lie. (The gray slug screams as it is propelled all the way past the finish line)

'''Kai''': Wow! Wow, wow, wow. What a race! Well, the slugs have decided. Meeting's on.

''(Kai and Zane lead the Geckles to the meeting in their {{Suit|Hero}} suits.)''

'''Zane''': I do not see the necessity of this armor.

'''Gulch''': Merely a precaution. Just in case it is an ambush. The slugs are never wrong, but I suppose there's always a first.

'''Kai''': What do you know about this new Munce Queen? What's she like?

'''Gulch''': I have no idea. Except the Munce consider her very fierce and very ... ugly.

'''Kai''': Ugh.

''(Nya is being carried by the Munce on the way to the truce meeting.)''

'''Nya''': Is it really necessary for them to carry me?

'''Murt''': You are queen of the Munce. Very important position. Yes, it is necessary.

'''Lloyd''': Hang in there, Nya. Just a little further.

'''Nya''': Kai!?

'''Kai''': Nya? (They embrace.)

'''Lloyd''': Guys!

'''Jay''': Boy, are we glad to see you!

'''Zane''': Lloyd!

'''Geckle''': Protect the Chancellor!

'''Munce''': Protect the Queen!

'''Kai''': Whoa, whoa. Easy, guys. Stand down!

'''Nya''': Yeah, relax, it's okay!

'''Gulch''': You know the Munce Queen?

'''Kai''': Yeah, it's my sister. And she's not ''that'' ugly.

'''Nya''': Excuse me?

'''Kai''': Uh, long story. Gulch, Gleck, relax, guys. Nothing's gonna happen. Okay? (The Grief-Bringer roars in the distance.)

'''Gulch''': That sound...

'''Murtessa''': No! It is not possible!

'''Nya''': What? What is it?

'''Gulch and Murtessa''': Grief-Bringer!

'''Nya''': Run! (The Geckles and Munce scream as they run away.)

'''Gleck''': This way!

'''Lloyd''': (To Nya) Get them to safety!

'''Nya''': What about you?

'''Lloyd''': We're gonna try to slow it down! Come on, Zane!

'''Zane''': (He uses Ice to block the Grief-Bringer's attacks.) I - I can't hold it!

'''Nya''': (They halt in front of lava.) Oh no!

'''Kai''': Oh, what do we do now?

'''Gleck''': It's easy! Like this! (He grabs a rope and swings to the other side.)

'''Kai''': Well, if Jay can do it, how hard can it be? (He slams into the rock face.) Help!

'''Nya''': Grab my hand!

'''Zane''': Lloyd! I cannot hold it much longer!

'''Lloyd''': On three, let it go! Trust me! On three! One, two, three! (The ice shatters, and Lloyd blasts the Grief-Bringer with [[Energy]], then collapses.)

'''Zane''': Lloyd! (The Grief-Bringer reassembles itself.) We must run!

'''Nya''': Come on! Swing across!

'''Skull Sorcerer''': Look at them, fleeing like rats. But they cannot escape.

'''Hazza D'ur''': Grief will come to you all!
