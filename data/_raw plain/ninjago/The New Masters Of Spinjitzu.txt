}}''(The episode begins at the [[Underworld]] with the [[Skulkin]] Army still trapped in the Ferris Wheel that the [[ninja]] created using the [[Tornado of Creation]].)''

'''[[Kruncha]]''': ''(Growls.) This'' bites.

'''[[Nuckal]]''': Tell me about it. Since those ninjas came down here and did that Twistitzu—

'''Kruncha''': ''[[Spinjitzu]]''!

'''Nuckal''': Everything has just been... not cool.

'''Kruncha''': They think they're so tough. Well, they wouldn't be so tough if they didn't have those [[Golden Weapons|Magic Weapons]]. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?!

''(The two Skeleton Generals then escape the Ferris Wheel and cross-over to the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu]]. They then steal the Golden Weapons from the sleeping ninja and head outside to celebrate.)''

'''Kruncha''': Yeah!

'''Nuckal''': We're the Masters of Spin—''(He loses control of the [[Nunchucks of Lightning]] and spins inside a [[Lightning]] Spinjitzu. During the process, he accidentally turns on the training course and knocks Kruncha onto the spinning poles (which decapitates his whole body), but Nuckal spins to him, rebuilding him in the process.)''

'''Kruncha''': Oh, I'm okay!

''(Nuckal spins right to Kruncha, getting him inside the Spinjitzu. Kruncha punches Nuckal, which immediately stops the Spinjitzu.)''

'''Kruncha''': ''(Wielding the [[Sword of Fire]].) Oh, I'll get you for that! (He loses control of the Weapon and activates a [[Fire]] Spinjitzu.)''

''(As Kruncha is spinning in the Spinjitzu, Nuckal laughs, but is hit by the Spinjitzu, which sets his foot on fire and soon gets attacked by Kruncha in the Spinjitzu. They stop spinning when Kruncha strangles Nuckal. A half-asleep [[Kai]] exits the building to turn off the training course, not noticing the two skeletons.)''

'''Kai''': [[Jay]]! The training course turned itself on again! You really need to fix it! ''(Goes back inside.)''

'''Jay''''': (Off-screen.)'' Aw... I'll do it tomorrow!

'''Kruncha''': I don't think this is gonna work.

''(The Skeleton Generals return the Weapons to their rightful positions. They then head back to the Underworld.)''

'''Kruncha''': That was your worst idea yet!

'''Nuckal''': What?! It was ''your'' idea!

''(The episode ends with the two fighting each other.)''
