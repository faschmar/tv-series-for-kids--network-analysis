'''[[Machia]]''': (threatening [[Cyrus Borg]]) Build the [[time apparatus]], now!

'''Cyrus''': It simply can't be done!

'''Machia''': (moves closer) Do it!

'''Cyrus''': But I don't have the proper parts.

'''Machia''': DO IT!

(Cyrus wheels himself over to the workbench. A small montage of Cyrus building the Apparatus involves him either rejecting certain metal parts from Machia, welding some together and moving about. Before long, Cyrus had completed a propellor-like device, which soon starts up before exploding)

'''Machia''': (growls) AGAIN!

'''Cyrus''': (looks around) I need parts. (he shrugs while Machia looks around to see the shelves are completely bare)

'''Machia''': (growls and leaves the room while Cyrus resumes work. She puts a hand to her head as her eyes glow from the hive mind) Listen up, we need more metal. And we need it now! (another explosion soon occurs in the room, causing her to groan in annoyance)
