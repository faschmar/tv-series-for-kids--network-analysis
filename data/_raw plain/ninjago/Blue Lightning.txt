''([[Jay]] walks up to [[Wu]], who is watching [[monks]] finish the [[Ninjago history mural|murals]] .)''

'''Jay''': Hi, Master. What's happening?

'''Wu''': Oh, hello, Jay. Nothing much, except witnessing the birth of this historical—

'''Jay''': Wow! Look at that! My [[Storm Glider|Lightning Jet]]! Remember how cool that was? All I had to do was swing my [[Nunchucks of Lightning|nunchuck]] around and...

'''Wu''': Uh, yes. The [[Golden Weapons|Four Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu]]. Each possessing the power of [[Creation]], forged by my father, the [[First Spinjitzu Master]]. In the molten steams of the [[Golden Peaks]].

''(Jay gets a flashback about his Storm Glider.)''

'''Past Jay''': Yee-haw! I just love my Lightning Jet!

'''Past Wu''': ''(On computer)'' Jay, multiple reports of [[Serpentine]] attacks. [[Pythor]] has been reported at [[The Teeth]] raiding a convoy of [[noodle trucks]]. He's up to something.

'''Past Jay''': Hmm, mm, mmm. A [[Chen|Mr. Chen]] [[Chen's Noodle House|delivery]] of noodle goodness. That builds up an appetite.

'''Past Pythor''': Oh, dear. Battle stations, people! That's right, ninja! The exalted Serpentine King, Pythor P. Chumsworth sends his regards! Oh, I love saying that.

'''Past Jay''': Hey, watch it. I'm shocked. ''(He uses [[Lightning]] on the Venomari.)'' Haha, correction: ''you're'' shocked. ''(A Venomari shoots a mountain side.)'' Whoa! Trying to rock me? How about a taste of your own medicine? ''(He does the same, and the rocks fall on them.)'' Bowling with boulders. ''(Laughs.)'' Lightning strut. Two down, two to go.

'''Past Pythor''': Take him down. We have places to be.

'''Past Jay''': Time to get down and dirty. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Three against one? Heh. Fair odds to me. ''(More Venomaris climb up.)'' Oh, come on. Now I have to count all over again. Ninja, go! ''(He attacks, and the Serpentine retreat.)'' Ha! Take that, exalted Serpentine King, Pythor Chumsworth. That'll teach you not to mess with honesty, dependency, distributives, or fine foods!

'''Past Pythor''': Wha—

'''Past Jay''': Man, I gotta work on my one liners.

''(Jay accidentally hits himself with his nunchucks, snapping himself out of his flashback.)''

'''Jay''': Ow! ''(He notices it's dark and no one's there.)'' Aw, great. I missed supper again. I guess I'm ordering take out. ''(He makes a call on his phone.)'' Hello? Mr. Chen's [[Chen's Noodle House|Noodle Empire]]? Quick question, do you deliver?
