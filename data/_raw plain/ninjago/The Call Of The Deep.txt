''(In the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu|Monastery]], [[Maya]] goes to wake [[Nya]], who was snoring, up.)''

'''Maya''': Rise and shine, sleepyhead! It's 6 A.M.! Early ninja gets the worm! ''(She sees the state of Nya's room.)'' Oh, my! Would you look at this mess. Dear, dear, dear. Okay, let's tidy this place up. A messy room makes for a messy ninja, Nya, and we are not messy ninjas. Spears belong in their racks, [[shurikens]] and throwing stars belong in the shuriken and throwing star bin -

'''Nya''': Make it stop.

'''Maya''': Bladed weapons don't just get stabbed into a wall, they actually have a place! And [[chickens]] do not belong indoors! ''(She forces [[Wu's chicken]] out of the room)'' Now this place is starting to look like something. Are you still lying there? Come on, up up up, sleepyhead. I find the best way to start the day and chase away those sleepies is with a few jumping jacks! Ready set go! One - and - two - and - one - and - two - and - ''(She continues counting and doing jumping jacks in the background.)''

'''Nya''': Am I having a nightmare, or is this really happening?
----''(In the kitchen, Nya walks in to see Maya cooking.)''

'''Nya''': You made breakfast?

'''Maya''': Of course I made breakfast! It's the most important meal of the day! If we're going to get you back in shape and fix your life, you're gonna need your strength.

'''Nya''': My life does not need ''fixing'', Mother.

'''Maya''': That's not what your [[Kai|brother]] says. He says your powers are going haywire and you can't control [[water]] anymore. Personally, I never had that problem when I was [[Elemental Masters|master]] of water, but never fear! We'll figure it out together.

'''Nya''': Um, why is the bacon green?

'''Maya''': That's not bacon, silly. It's seaweed.

'''Nya''': Seaweed?

'''Maya''': Goes great with tofu pancakes!

'''Nya''': ''(She pokes the pancakes.)'' Ew. Yeah, no.

'''Maya''': And it will get you in tune with your element. Now eat up. Gobble gobble!

'''Nya''': No way am I eat- ''(Maya shoves a spoonful in Nya's mouth before she can finish her sentence.)''
----''(Later, Maya sets down a pail of water in front of Nya in the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu#Courtyard|courtyard]].)''

'''Maya''': Now for some basics. Assume water stance. ''(Nya starts poising.)'' No, no, no. Your form is terrible, dear. Not like that, like this! ''(She demonstrates, and Nya follows.)'' Uh-uh. Arms up. ''(Nya does it again.)'' Not quite. ''(She pokes Nya with [[Wu]]'s [[Bo staff|staff]] as Nya grows more exasperated by the minute.)'' Back straight, plant your legs, hands up, eyes fixed, breathe in and out, in and out. Not like a [[Minos|Mino]], dear, just like a [[Humans|person]].

'''Nya''': Okay, that's it. I can't do this! My water stance is fine, Mom!

'''Maya''': Well, if it was fine, you wouldn't be having all the problems you're having, dear.

'''Nya''': I'm not having problems. It was a one-time mistake, Mom. It won't happen again! ''(She stamps her foot angrily, which causes her to be soaked and the bucket to fall on her head. Maya gives her a little smile, and she groans and leaves angrily.)''
----''(In the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu/Rooms#Library|library]], Wu is looking through scrolls next to [[Misako]], while Nya complains to him.)''

'''Nya''': But there has to be something you can do!

'''Wu''': To accomplish what?

'''Nya''': To get her to leave! She's driving me bonkers. Can't you tell her that you found a solution? That we don't need her help anymore?

'''Wu''': I have been searching, Nya, but there's surprisingly little information on the elemental power of water. Your mother may be our best option.

'''Misako''': She just wants to help, Nya. She's been gone a long time. She wants to be your mother, and take care of you.

'''Nya''': ''(Sighs.)'' I know, but she's taking over. She's doing everything. She's got all this advice, all these sayings, she fed me bacon made out of seaweed!

'''Wu''': Perhaps you should talk to your brother. Kai might be able to help.

'''Nya''': Kai? Kai wouldn't understand. He probably likes being waited on. I bet he ''loves'' being treated like a baby.

'''Misako''': I'm sure that's not true. Kai's a grown man. Talk to your brother.

''(Nya sighs and walks away. In the relaxation room, Kai and [[Ray]] are playing [[Lava Zombies]].)''

'''Kai''': Oh, I got the powerup. Get ready, Dad.

'''Ray''': Roger that!

'''Nya''': Hey -

'''Ray and Kai''': Fiya! ''(They do a high five, not taking their eyes off the screen.)''

'''Kai''': Scorcher!

'''Nya''': Can I talk to -

'''Ray''': Oh, uh, hi Nya. We're about to break a new record. Nice move, Kai!

'''Kai''': Thanks, Dad! Not as good as you, though.

'''Ray''': Ah, thanks, son.

'''Nya''': Kai, can I talk to you for a sec?

'''Kai''': Oh, here comes the big boss! Hit him with all you've got!

'''Ray''': Oh, take that, you big oaf!

'''Maya''': I made sandwiches!

'''Kai''': Pause! Ham and cheese sandwiches with crispy bacon?

'''Maya''': Oh, you bet!

'''Kai''': Oh thanks, Mommy! You're the best! ''(He takes a bite.)'' Mm, bacon is the best too!

''(Nya grimaces and leaves exasperatedly. In the [[hangar bay]], [[Lloyd]] and [[Cole]] are fixing the computer.)''

'''Cole''': Okay, think I've fixed it. Try the video feed.

'''Lloyd''': That did the trick.

'''Nya''': Can I help?

'''Lloyd''': Oh, thanks, Nya, but we're basically done.

'''Nya''': Where are [[P.I.X.A.L.]] and [[Zane]]?

'''Cole''': ''(Nervously)'' Uh, they, um, kind of ... went on a mission.

'''Nya''': Mission? Why didn't they tell me?

'''Lloyd''': ''(Also nervously)'' They thought it might be better to ... handle it on their own.

'''Nya''': Why?

'''Cole''': It ... was a water rescue.

''(Nya sighs and leaves dejectedly.)''
----''(Out above the [[Endless Sea|ocean]], Zane and P.I.X.A.L. are heading towards a rescue in the [[ShuriCopter]] and [[Samurai X Mech (P.I.X.A.L.)|Kaiju Mech]].)''

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': I cannot help but feel a little badly that we did not include Nya on this mission.

'''Zane''': I have similar misgivings, but in her current state, Nya would only present a danger.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': As does that. ''(She points towards the ''[[Mary Louise]]'' being held by an [[Octopuses|octopus]].)''

'''Woman''': Help, help! Over here!

'''Man''': We're going down!

'''Zane''': I do not understand. Octopuses are peaceful creatures who seldom venture to the surface.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': I will attempt to calm it down and ''(The octopus's tentacles wrap around her.)'' - something has clearly agitated it.

'''Zane''': P.I.X.A.L., are you okay?

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': I am fine. Please attend to the sailors while I attempt to reason with the creature.

'''Zane''': Affirmative. ''(He freezes the water under the sailors, who cheer.)''

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Please release me before I am forced to resort to physical measures. I repeat, please - ''(A mysterious pulse causes both vehicles to malfunction.)'' 

'''Automated Warning Voice''': Danger. Danger. 

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': What was that? 

'''Zane''': P.I.X.A.L.. P.I.X.A.L., do you copy? 

''(Back at the Monastery, Nya climbs into the [[Bell of Divinity]] to soak in the water. Suddenly, the pulse passes through and disrupts the water.)'' 

'''Nya''': You've got to be kidding me. 

''(In the kitchen, Lloyd is doing the dishes when the water goes out of control. In the bathroom, Jay encounters similar problems.)'' 

'''Jay''': What is up with the plumbing today? ''(The water shoots upwards at him and he screams.)'' 

''(In the ocean, P.I.X.A.L. has been pulled into the water and is sinking.)''

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Please release me, before I am forced to resort to physical measures. I repeat, please - ''(Suddenly, the octopus lets go and leaves.)''

'''Zane''': P.I.X.A.L., if you can hear me, eject from the mech. I'm sending down a line. ''(He shoots a grappler into the water, but it doesn't reach P.I.X.A.L. in time.)''

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Zane! Zane, do you copy? I have lost all power.

'''Zane''': P.I.X.A.L., come in! ''(He presses some buttons and the Shuricopter goes back to normal.)'' P.I.X.A.L., if you can hear me, reboot your primary ignition system. Reboot primary ignition!

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Hmm, this is somewhat troubling.

'''Automated Warning Voice''': Danger. Approaching crush depth. Danger. Crush depth. Hull integrity failure in ten seconds. Nine. Eight.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Nya taught me a peculiar method in situations like this, which sometimes proves effective. I believe it goes like this. ''(She punches the control panel, which restarts the mech successfully.)'' That's better.

'''Zane''': P.I.X.A.L., come in. Can you hear me? P.I.X.A.L.!

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': I have decided to look into how to pressurize our vehicles for better depth deployment.

'''Zane''': ''(He breathes a sigh of relief.)'' There you are. I was worried.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': I am worried too, Zane. What was that?

'''Zane''': Some kind of energy signal or pulse. I am attempting to triangulate its source. The pulse, whatever it was, appears to originate from out at sea.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': From the surface?

'''Zane''': No, deep below the surface. If I am not mistaken, a trench of some kind.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': The energy pulse is what affected that creature. I fear it may also be affecting Nya's powers.

'''Zane''': ''(sighs)'' If you are correct, we must warn the others.
----''(Back at the Monastery, Wu and the others are cleaning up the water when Nya walks in.)''

'''Nya''': I'm ... I'm sorry for all the trouble. I don't know what's going on with me, but all of this is my fault.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': I do not believe that is true.

'''Wu''': What do you mean?

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': Zane and I believe that an unexplained energy signal from the deep ocean is responsible for the fluctuations in your powers.

'''Lloyd''': What energy signal?

'''Zane''': A pulse, of unknown origins.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': It appears to originate here, in the [[Tartarus Trench]]. ''(She projects a screen from her eyes.)''

'''Zane''': It is the deepest known point in the ocean.

'''Wu''': Didn't you build a submersible capable of deep sea exploration a number of years ago?

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': I did, the ''[[Hydro Bounty]]''. But it was never fully tested.

'''Wu''': It's about to be. You're going diving.
