}}''(Continuing from the [[The Weakest Link/Transcript|previous episode]], [[Ultra Violet]] pushes [[Skylor]] to her knees.)''

'''[[Mystake]]''': ''(As [[Harumi]].)'' My [[Garmadon|Lord]], I have proved my allegiance time and time again. For you to doubt my abilities—

'''Harumi''': Is what?! Two-faced? That isn't me, Emperor Garmadon.

'''Garmadon''': Hmm.

'''Mystake''': ''(As Harumi.)'' You're the impostor! Arrest her n—

'''Garmadon''': Let. Her. Speak.

'''Harumi''': That is Mystake. The shape-shifting [[Oni]] I was telling you about. She tried to get the [[Elemental Masters|Master]] of [[Amber]] close enough to touch you so that [[the Resistance]] could turn your [[Destruction|power]] against us.

''(Skylor rips out the ropes and tries to run to touch Garmadon. Ultra Violet immediately brings her to her knees again. Mystake sees the struggle and runs to help Skylor but [[Killow]] grabs her and holds her in the air.)''

'''Garmadon''': Well done, Harumi. ''(Mystake flails, trying to free herself.)'' It's good to have you back, my child.

'''Harumi''': ''(Smiles.)'' The pleasure was all mine, Father.

'''Skylor''': ''(She stands up, throwing off Ultra Violet's grip.)'' He's not your father. His son is [[Lloyd]]— ''(Ultra Violet pushes her down.)''

'''Garmadon''': I thought I smelled an Oni. ''(He looks at the Mystake-Harumi form.)'' Looks like your plan backfired.

'''Mystake''': ''(Human voice, Harumi form.)'' The only thing that backfired is you turning against your [[First Spinjitzu Master|father]]'s [[Ninjago|realm]]. Ninjago is a place of [[Creation|light]], and you are a source of shadow.

'''Garmadon''': You know it all turns to darkness.

'''Mystake''': ''(Human voice, Harumi form.)'' The future is not in your hands.

'''Garmadon''': Show me, Oni. Show me your real face. Or are you worried what your friends might think of you, demon?

'''Mystake''': ''(Human voice, Harumi form.)'' Maybe I'll show you. ''(She slowly transforms into her Oni form with smoke to disguise her entrance in the air, landing on the ground. Killow lets go and covers his ears.)''

'''Mystake''': ''(Oni Voice and form.)'' But only for you to see what a full-blooded Oni can do.

''(She knocks Garmadon back on to his throne seat. Garmadon hits her with his power. Mystake takes it and releases it to the air. Skylor pushes Ultra Violet back and kicks her across the floor when she moves to push Skylor down. Faint fighting noises of Mystake and Garmadon in the background.)''

'''Harumi''': ''(Screams.)'' No! ''(She jumps on Mystake. Mystake throws her off.)'' Don't let her touch the Emperor!

''(A fight breaks out as Skylor and Mystake try to reach Garmadon while the SoG hold them back.)''

'''Mystake''': ''(Oni Voice and form, chanting.)'' Ee Mah Vee-aza-bub. ''(Garmadon knocks Mystake down with his powers. Garmadon pushes her down, Mystake continues chanting.)'' Ee Mah Vee-zaz-bub. ''(She forms a staff, kicks Garmadon in the stomach, throwing him off her, then slams the staff down, forming a black cloud of [[Dark Magic]].)''

'''Harumi''': My Emperor, look out! ''(Garmadon sees Mystake in the form of Skylor, and hits her with his power. Smoke comes out of Mystake as she transforms back to herself.)''

'''Mystake''': Never trust... an Oni.

'''Skylor''': ''(Touches Garmadon.)'' Gotcha.

'''Harumi''': Don't let her leave!

'''Mystake''': Go, Skylor! ''(Garmadon grabs her by her arm Skylor runs to the stairs, sees the rest of the [[Sons of Garmadon]] blocking her way. She backs away to the edge of the top of the tower.)''

'''Harumi''': It's over. ''(Skylor gasps and looks behind her.)'' There's nowhere to go. ''(Skylor leaps off the side, landing on a blimp. Ultra Violet pulls her sai out, guarding Garmadon while he demands Mystake to surrender.)''

'''Garmadon''': Surrender.

'''Mystake''': Surrender? Never heard of it! ''(Creates a staff and tries to hit Garmadon but he stops it.)''

'''Garmadon''': That was your last mistake, Mystake.

''(Skylor uses SoG banner on blimp to swing to a building and umps down to a set of emergency stairs alongside building. She sees Killow and listens.)''

'''Killow''': Skylor escaped. Hunt her down!

'''SoG Rider''': What about the old woman?

'''Killow''': Oh, we no longer have to worry about her. ''(SoG screeches off.)''

'''Skylor''': Oh, no.
----''(In the [[Realm of Oni and Dragons|First Realm]], [[Faith]] is stuck in the ground.)''

'''[[Cole]]''': ''(Looks through a telescope.)'' Yeah. That's her.

'''[[Wu]]''': We have to go down and save her.

'''[[Kai]]''': No, we have to get the [[Dragon Armor]]. In case you've forgotten, they don't have the map and we do.

'''[[Zane]]''': Kai is correct. And it appears this could be a trap.

'''[[Jay]]''': Oh, really? Really? It takes a [[Nindroids|Nindroid]] to figure that out? Eh, sorry, Wu, but we can't go out there. If we want to go home, we need to find the [[Firstbourne's nest]]. ''(Wu takes the telescope from Cole and looks in it himself.)''

'''Cole''': Well, maybe more of his memories came back. Something that could help us in a situation like this.

'''Kai''': Is that true? Do you remember more?

'''Wu''': ''(Sighs.)'' I can't lie, they haven't. But my father told me I have to have faith, and without her, we would have never gotten this far. Besides, [[ninja]] never leave friends behind. ''(He looks back at Faith.)''

'''Kai''': ''(Everyone joins Teen Wu.)'' And we've got your back.

'''Wu''': They must have left her here for the elements to finish her off. ''(Everyone is on guard while getting Faith. Faith tries to talk in her gag. Wu pulls Faith's hat off.)'' Are you okay? ''(He removes her gag.)''

'''Faith''': ''(Coughs.)'' You should not have come. It's a trap. ''(The ninja are surrounded by [[Dragon Hunters]].)''

'''Jay''': And... it's a trap. ''(He drops his mace.)''

''(Later that night, the Hunters feast around a campfire.)''

'''[[Iron Baron]]''': ''(Laughs.)'' Eat up, Hunters! We have the son of the First Spinjitzu Master. By first light, with him by my side, the [[Firstbourne]] will gladly give up the rest of the Dragon Armor. Then, it will be a feast, every night!

''(The Dragon Hunters cheer and continue to feast and drink. All the ninja and Faith are tied up.)''

'''Jay''': Could you pass a roasted lizard stick up here? I'm hungry too. No? No takers? Oh, that's okay, I'm-I'm kind of watching my figure anyway.

'''Wu''': I'm sorry. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I've only made it worse.

'''Faith''': Hmm. Your heart is pure, but this realm is cruel. I am just sorry you ever had to find this place.

'''Kai''': I don't sweat a little, Wu. We've seen worse. Any moment, Zane will have cut through the binds and we'll be out of here.

'''Zane''': Um, I cannot cut through these binds, Kai. Perhaps, there is another alternative you were thinking of?

'''Kai''': ''(Sighs.)'' But, Zane, I'm the good looks of the team. You're the brains.

'''Jay''': ''(Gasps in horror.)'' I thought I was the looks.

'''Cole''': No... you're the annoying one.

'''Jay''': What are you? The Party Pooper?

'''Kai''': Mr. Party Pooper to you.

'''Cole''': Har har, Hair Gel. ''(Cole, Kai, Jay, and Zane burst out laughing.)''

'''Wu''': How can you all make jokes at a time like this?

'''Kai''': ''(Still laughing.)'' You got this one, Jay?

'''Jay''': Well, when all hope is lost, sometimes a good laugh is all you need to stay positive. Helps cope with what's bad while opening your eyes to what's good.

'''Wu''': I understand, Jay. ''(He smiles.)'' You are the annoying one.

'''Jay''': Eh-heh... ''(Cole, Zane, Kai burst out laughing, Jay later joins in.)''

'''Kai''': He's got you over.

'''Wu''': Did I do that right?

'''Jay''': Yeah.

'''Wu''': A joke? ''(Everyone including Faith bursts out laughing.)''

'''Iron Baron''': What is so funny?

'''Faith''': What is funny is you feeding them this food, to cover the taste of your lies.

'''Iron Baron''': ''(Laughs.)'' Well, I'd rather be eating food with them, than stuck on a pole with you. ''(The Dragon Hunters jeer and laugh.)''

'''Faith''': He only cares for himself. If he gets the armor, he'll have no need for you except to kiss his hand! ''(The Dragon Hunters gasp.)''

'''Iron Baron''': ''(Laughs.)'' Let me ask them, Heavy Metal. How can you believe anything she says, when she hid behind a mask? ''(The Dragon Hunters support and argue. [[Muzzle]] mumbles to [[Daddy No Legs]].)''

'''Daddy No Legs''': Oh, yeah, yeah, that's true. That is definitely not what I had expected.

'''Faith''': It's he who is the fraud! He forced me to wear the helmet just as he forced you to be his ''slaves''! ''(The Dragon Hunters gasp and look at each other, Daddy No Legs shrugs in confusion. They all go back to arguing.)'' We have all heard Baron's stories about how he had fought an army of Oni. Well, look around! We are on Oni land, and yet has anyone seen a single one?

'''Dragon Hunters''': ''(Murmuring.)'' Yeah. I have not seen any.

'''Faith''': No. You have not, because his stories are just that. Stories! The Oni left these lands long ago, yet he keeps you in fear of them. His power over you is built on lies! Brave Hunters ''died'' so that he could get the [[Dragonbone Blade|Dragon Blade]]. How do we know it was not him, who took their lives?!

'''Dragon Hunters''': ''(Murmuring in realization, snatches of conversation heard.)'' How do we... though... ninja is true...

'''Iron Baron''': Not another word! (Everyone stops talking.) Now, show of hands. Raise them if you're with her, so I can raise my Dragon Blade to lop them off! ''(Muzzle half-raises his hand, then slowly puts it down.)''

'''Jay''': That's not fair! You bullied them!

'''Iron Baron''': I said, "Not another word!" ''(Turns on machine. The ninja and Wu start laughing. Wu continues laughing, then gasps as his memories return.)''

'''Past Wu''': The best way to defeat your enemy is to make them your friend. Never put off until tomorrow what can be done today.

'''Wu''': I remember. ''(Voice slightly changes.)'' I remember it all. ''(He breaks free of the chains and back-flips on to the ground. He then stands up, revealing a mustache and a goatee on his face.)''

'''Jay''': Oh my gosh! He just grew a mustache. ''(Wu strokes his goatee.)'' And a goatee!

'''Iron Baron''': Get him!

''(A Dragon Hunter tries to strike Wu but he steps aside and grabs the staff. He spins around, using the staff to knock her off her feet and strikes her down in the stomach to the ground. Wu takes her bamboo hat as his.)''

'''Wu''': You will let my ninja go, or else.

'''Iron Baron''': Or else what? ''(Dragon Hunters step closer.)''

'''Wu''': Or else I will reclaim my father's armor and ask his dragon to end your rule. I am the Son of the First Spinjitzu Master and this is my oath! ''(He swings his staff at Iron Baron.)''

'''Jay''': Alright! Master Wu's back, baby!

'''Iron Baron''': ''(Iron Baron raises his sword in return.)'' So you just confirmed it. The Legend is true: He who reclaims the Armor controls the Firstbourne.

'''Wu''': That's not what I said.

'''Iron Baron''': You seem like a wise master. Are you really ignorant enough to take on me and my entire camp? ''(Dragon Hunters burst forward to attack Wu but he defeats them all.)''

'''Cole''': Don't give in, Master Wu. We've got your back.

'''Kai''': Yeah. If you can cut us down first.

'''Iron Baron''': ''(He grabs Wu's staff.)'' Before you do something foolish, let me make you an offer. How about you get me the Armor or else we can see right now how good you really are with that... staff.

'''Wu''': You want me to take you to the Firstbourne?

'''Iron Baron''': Get me the Armor and I'll send your ninja home. ''(He lets go of Wu's staff.)''

'''Wu''': Do I have your word?

'''Faith''': Don't—

'''Iron Baron''': Trust me. There's nothing I want more. ''(Slow motion of Wu dropping his staff in agreement.)''

'''Kai''': Oh, no!

'''Wu''': I'm sorry, but we are left with no other choice.

'''Iron Baron''': Ah. We go now to the Firstbourne. ''(He marches Wu away. The Dragon Hunters cheer.)''

'''Wu''': Don't worry, ninja. Have faith.

'''Faith''': I hope he knows what he's doing.

'''Kai''': We've learned not to question him.

'''[[Jet Jack]]''': ''(She runs after Iron Baron.)'' You promised whoever got Heavy Metal would become your Number Two. Since it was me, I must insist I go with you for your protection.

'''Iron Baron''': ''(Laughs.)'' Protection? ''(He laughs again.)'' Once I have the Armor, I won't need protection. It will be you needing me. ''(He pushes Jet Jack back and continues laughing.)''
----''(In Ninjago, Skylor returns to the Resistance's hideout.)''

'''[[Lloyd]]''': Skylor!

'''[[Nya]]''': Where's Mystake?

'''Skylor''': I... I...

'''[[Dareth]]''': She didn't... make it? ''(Skylor shakes her head.)''

''(Nya kicks a garbage bag across the room in frustration. The garbage bag hits dump, moving a walkie-talkie.)''

'''Ultra Violet''': ''(On walkie-talkie.)'' Target last seen at the intersection of Nelson and LaMonica.

'''Killow''': ''(On walkie-talkie.)'' Got it. We're moving in.

'''Nya''': You were followed.

'''Lloyd''': Did you touch him?

'''Skylor''': Yes.

'''Lloyd''': Can you control [[Colossus|it]]?

'''Skylor''': Not sure. But there's one way to find out. ''(Everyone is at the top of the building as Skylor attempts to control the Colossus. The Colossus' fingers move, then spins around.)''

'''Nya''': Yes! Woo-hoo!

'''Lloyd''': ''(Simultaneously.)'' Yes! Haha. Alright.

'''Dareth''': ''(Simultaneously.)'' It's working! ''(The Colossus walks towards them.)''

'''Skylor''': That's... not... me.

'''Nya''': Garmadon is controlling it! We have to go.

'''Lloyd''': ''(Leads Skylor.)'' You can do this. Take control. Break his hold.

'''Skylor''': ''(Struggles.)'' I... can't.

'''Dareth''': Uh... that's close enough for me. ''(He screams and runs into the building.)''

'''Nya''': We need to get out of here. Your father's too powerful.

'''Lloyd''': Control it, Skylor. I have faith in you. You felt his power and now it's yours. You can do it. Control it. Feel his power. ''(Garmadon prepares the blow as Harumi laughs on.)'' Control it.

'''Harumi''': Destroy them.

''(Garmadon brings his hand down but Skylor manages to stop the Colossus's hand.)''

'''Skylor''': ''(Struggles, taking the control slowly.)'' I'm... doing it.

'''Lloyd''': Yes! Now use it. ''(Skylor yells as she takes control. Her force surprises Garmadon and he loses control. Down below the Resistance, the SoG rides in.)''

'''Killow''': There. On the rooftop. ''(Skylor uses the Colossus to step on SoG vehicles.)'' Watch out! Where are you going? Cowards!

'''Ultra Violet''': ''(She puts on the [[Oni Mask of Hatred]].)'' Now we will have a fight! ''(She continuously punches the Colossus.)''

'''Skylor''': I wanted to do this for a long time. ''(She uses the Colossus to pick up Ultra Violet.)''

''(Killow puts on the [[Oni Mask of Deception]] and throws cars up at the Colossus. The Colossus blocks them and the cars fall back down towards him. The cars land on him and his mask falls off. He picks up the mask, only to find it broken. Skylor turns the Colossus towards [[Borg Tower]].)''

'''Garmadon''': ''(Struggles.)'' No! No. ''(Screams.)'' No!

'''Skylor''': Yes.

'''Dareth''': ''(Steps out, laughing.)'' I always knew you could do it.

'''Nya''': It's time to knock the emperor. Off. His. Throne. ''(The Colossus reaches base of tower and starts to climb. Garmadon struggles and panics in realization as he tries to take back control.)''

'''Nya''': Yes! Woohoo! ''(The Colossus continues to climb. Garmadon continues to struggle.)''

'''Harumi''': Stop it!

'''Garmadon''': I-I can't.

'''Harumi''': We must leave. It's not safe here anymore.

'''Garmadon''': I do not flee. I control! ''(He continually fails to control. Harumi looks at him and runs away. Skylor raises the Colossus' right hand while Garmadon tries to take back control. Skylor struggles but swings the Colossus's hand down.)'' I am the Emperor. I am the Destructor. ''(He slowly gains control of the Colossus.)'' I am in control! ''(Skylor struggles to bring Colossus's hand down again.)''

'''Nya''': Something's wrong. ''(Skylor continues to struggle.'')

'''Garmadon''': ''(Both Skylor and Garmadon lose control and The Colossus falls down.)'' No. ''(People run away screaming.)'' Yes. ''(He walks the Colossus towards them.)''

'''Lloyd''': My father's power. It's too strong.

'''Skylor''': ''(She tries to regain back her control.)'' I can hold on. ''(The Colossus turns towards Garmadon.)''

'''Garmadon''': I am in control.

''(They both shake off the power but Garmadon'' ''immediately takes control.)''

'''Nya''': His power. It's hurting her!

'''Skylor''': I—

''(Garmadon tries to regain his control. The Colossus wobbles. Harumi is seen ziplining down to a condo. The Colossus crashes into the building. Harumi screams and slides down an emergency ladder, running into the building. She sees an exit and frantically trys to open the door. She kicks it open and starts to run down the emergency stairs.)''

'''Son''': Mom, Dad, don't leave me! ''(He starts to cry. Harumi hears and hesitates, then runs back and finds them, watching from afar.)''

'''Mother''': Please, take him. ''(She pushes her son towards the elevator.)''

'''Son''': ''(Sobs.)'' No...

''(Memories come back as Harumi remembers how she lost her parents.)''

'''Past Harumi''': I wanna stay. [[Harumi's mother|Mama]]!

'''Past Harumi's mother''': We'll see you when we get down. I promise!

'''Harumi''': I'll get you out. Together. ''(She pulls the kid from the elevator.)'' I promise. ''(She leads the family to the emergency stairway.)''

'''Mother''': Thank you.

'''Harumi''': ''(She smiles but then the building collapses, blocking the exit. The Mom looks at her.)'' Go. I'll find another way. ''(She panics and runs back to top of the building. She sees the Colossus getting out of control between Skylor and Garmadon's fight. People run away screaming for their lives.)''

'''Nya''': Let go, Skylor! Let go! ''(Skylor's eyes turn purple.)''

'''Lloyd''': She can't. ''(He pulls Skylor away from the side of the building.)'' His power will kill her.

'''Garmadon''': ''(The Colossus falls on the building Harumi is standing on and he sees Harumi.)'' My child.

'''Harumi''': No. ''(She sees the Resistance on the other side. She panics, realizing her fate.)''

'''Lloyd''': ''(Holding Skylor.)'' Rumi... ''(Everyone watches as her building falls.)''

'''Garmadon''': ''(Screams.)'' No! ''(He bows down and then gets up in anger.)'' You want this city, Lloyd? Then you can have it, in ruins! ''(He marches the Colossus towards them.)''

'''Nya''': ''(Shakes Skylor.)'' I—I can't wake her up. It's like his power poisoned her.

'''Dareth''': Whoa whoa whoa, Doctor of Dark Arts. Should any of us really be making a diagnosis?

'''Lloyd''': No. Nya's right. I think the only way to save Skylor is to get his power out of her. ''(He tries to help Skylor.)''

'''Dareth''': I don't know anything about that. But I do know what's coming our way! ''(Everyone except Skylor looks up to see the Colossus approaching them.)''
