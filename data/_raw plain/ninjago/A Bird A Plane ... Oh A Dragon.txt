'''[[Nya]]''': Welcome back to our...

'''[[Jay]] and Nya''': Ninja Vlog!

----

'''Nya''': So we asked you to participate in our latest [[LEGO Life]] building challenge.

'''Jay''': And boy, did you deliver!

'''Nya''': For some reason, some were a bit... [[Chickens|chicken]]-inspired?

'''Jay''': This is getting out of—Whoa! That is a cool jungle speeder!

'''Nya''': I know and look at this amazing rainbow bird!

'''Jay''': It's great! I mean it really is, but I think I'm a little more on board with this couch-carrying chicken robot.

'''Nya''': Jay...

'''Jay''': What? It seems like a good way to get around.

----

'''Nya''': Thank you all for your awesome island exploration vehicles.

'''Jay''': B-But wait till you see what I managed to get my hands on.

----

''(They're standing outside in the jungle.)''

'''Nya''': We're just about to head into the jungle.

'''Jay''': I had to beg but [[Lloyd]]'s letting me borrow his [[Jungle Choppers|jungle chopper]]. It's so perfect for jungle trails! I mean it's got the suspension, we're just going to sail over the roots like— ''(He imitates them flying across the ground.)''

'''Nya''': See, I'm not sure we need the surf glider. I mean it's detachable anyway.

'''Jay''': ''(He jerks his imagination to a stop.)'' Nya? I have just one counterpoint.

'''Nya''': Hmm?

'''Jay''': It looks cool!

'''Nya''': Okay. It can stay.

'''Jay''': Hooray!

''(A roar is heard.)''

'''Nya''': Jay, get down!

----

''(They're both hiding behind some rocks.)''

'''Jay''': What is that?

'''Nya''': It's a [[Zippy|dragon]]!

'''Jay''': Why do you sound so excited?

'''Nya''': Because it's cool!

'''Jay''': Cool?! That thing is probably looking for its dinner, and we're on the menu!

'''Nya''': I don't know, Jay. It seems harmless.

----

''(They stand next to Lloyd's jungle chopper.)''

'''Jay''': What were you saying about harmless?

'''Nya''': It bit off an entire wheel of Lloyd's bike. Awesome!

'''Jay''': Awesome? Awesome?! Whoa whoa, no, no, no. You do realize it could easily just have been one of ''us'' flying away in those jaws?!

'''Nya''': Well, I can think of one thing worse.

'''Jay''': What?!

'''Nya''': Telling Lloyd we ruined his bike.

'''Jay''': Oh...

----

''(They return to the [[Destiny's Bounty|ship]].)''

'''Jay''': Well, I can confirm that Lloyd's never letting me borrow his jungle chopper again.

'''Nya''': Well, I know something that can make you feel better. ''(Jay scoffs.)'' I've set up a meme challenge for the viewers at home and we can go over the results next time.

'''Jay''': Well, I guess that would make me feel a little better.

----

'''Nya''': Find out more on the LEGO Life app. Plus, I've uploaded a lightning-proof chicken sticker as a treat for you all. ''(Jay groans and laughs.)'' But that's all for this week.

'''Jay''': Join us next time when we'll be exploring more on the island.

'''Jay and Nya''': ''(They both laugh.)'' Bye!

----

'''Nya''': Don't worry, Jay. I'm sure Lloyd will get over his bike.

'''Jay''': Really? You think so? You think he might let me borrow it again in the future? N-Nya?
