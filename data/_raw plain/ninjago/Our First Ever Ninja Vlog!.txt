'''[[Nya]]''': Is this thing on? There we go! Hmm, now where is... [[Jay]]?

'''Jay''': ''(He walks backwards in through the doorway.)'' All those [[noodles]] were delicious! I'm so glad that I—

'''Nya''': Really, Jay? You're late to our first ever vlog?

'''Jay''': Nya, I can explain.

'''Nya''': Hmm, go on, then.

'''Jay''': Oh, well, um, funny story—

'''Nya''': Is the story you got distracted by noodles and forgot about all this?

'''Jay''': Uh, yeah, that pretty much covers it.

----

'''Jay''': Hey, everyone! Welcome to our first ever— ''(Turns to Nya.)'' Ready?

'''Nya''': I was born ready.

'''Jay and Nya''': Ninja Vlog!

----

'''Jay''': I'm Nya! And this is Jay!

'''Nya''': You sure about that?

----

'''Jay''': I'm Jay.

'''Nya''': And I'm Nya. We're on our ship.

'''Jay''': The [[Destiny's Bounty|''Destiny's Bounty'']].

'''Nya''': Having just set off from [[Ninjago]] to the treacherous [[storm belt]].

'''Jay''': To locate a mysterious and undiscovered island. [[P.I.X.A.L.]] says there's only ever been one boat to emerge from the storm belt before.

'''Nya''': Well soon there's gonna to be two. ''(She holds up her hand and Jay high-fives her.)''

'''Jay''': Ooh, I hope there's a jungle we can explore. Oh, as long as there are no rope bridges.

'''Nya''': Well, I'd love to do some exploring. Though the island's said to be deserted, these drawings [[Twitchy Tim|Twitchy]] drew on ''his'' expedition show signs of an ancient civilization. ''(She walks off screen.)''

'''Jay''': Huh. Looks creepy.

'''Nya''': Aw, are you scared, Jay?

'''Jay''': ''(Scoffs.)'' I laugh in the face of fear.

'''Nya''': ''(She sits down with a mask on her face.)'' Boo. ''(Jay yelps and falls off his chair. Nya bursts out into laughter.)''

'''Jay''': Hey, hey, no fair! You caught me off guard!

'''Nya''': Oh, good point actually.

'''Jay''': It is? I mean, yes, it is. ''(Nya chuckles.)''

----

'''Nya''': We don't want to be caught off guard when we arrive. That's why we made the challenge on [[LEGO Life]], asking you at home to build creatures we might encounter.

'''Jay''': Yeah, looking through what they built already, I think we prepared for anything! I mean, look at this one's teeth.

'''Nya''': But the tongue is so cute.

'''Jay''': Oh, I don't know. I still would much rather come across this guy.

'''Nya''': Aw, yeah, the little—the little.

'''Jay''': ''(Simultaneously.)'' Little crab—little legs.

'''Nya''': So cute.

'''Jay''': That's so cute.

'''Nya''': Oh, do you think you could take that one with the teeth, the scales, the tail? The fact that it moves?

'''Jay''': Just to be safe, I'll let ''you'' go first.

'''Nya''': Yeah. Mhm.

----

'''Jay''': Ooh, can I tell them about my poll on LEGO Life now?! Can I, can I, can I?!

'''Nya''': Go on.

'''Jay''': Hooray!

----

'''Jay''': In our next vlog, we're taking our vehicle to travel on to the island.

'''Nya''': Uh huh.

'''Jay''': You can help us out by voting for your favorite one using the poll that I put on the LEGO Life app.

'''Nya''': And remember, there's going to be a lot of huge waves and lightning storms.

'''Jay''': And not the good kind.

'''Nya''': So we'll see ''you'' in two weeks time with the poll results.

'''Jay''': Plus we'll film as we travel on to the island.

'''Jay and Nya''': Bye!

----

'''Nya''': I have a confession to make.

'''Jay''': What?

'''Nya''': All this talk about noodles has made me ''so'' hungry.

'''Jay''': ''(Gasps.)'' I was just thinking the same thing!
