''([[Maya]] and [[Nya]] escape in the [[APS suits]], pursued by [[Ripper Sharks]].)''

'''Nya''': Move it, Mom!

'''Maya''': I'm going as fast as I can!

'''Nya''': Well, they're going faster! I hope they're not hungry!

'''Maya''': These suits are metal. Don't they know metal tastes terrible?

'''Nya''': I don't think they care, Mom! ''(A sulfur blast causes Maya to veer off course, but Nya pulls her back.)'' I've got you, Mom.

'''Maya''': Nya! Move it or lose it!

'''Nya''': They're too fast! We can't outswim them! This is their element!

'''Maya''': [[Water]] is your element too, dear. This far undersea, your powers are stronger than anywhere else.

'''Nya''': Whoa!

'''Maya''': I know you can do this. ''(Nya uses her water powers on the sharks.)'' See? It's working! Don't forget about the third one!

'''Nya''': What third— ''(A shark slams her onto some boulders.)'' I can take him! Oh, no no no no no, don't shut down on me now!

''(Just then, [[Lloyd]] and [[Jay]] arrive and blast the sharks away with their harpoon guns.)''

'''Jay''': Back off, fish sticks!

'''Nya''': Jay!

'''Maya''': Impeccable timing, boys!

''(In the temple, [[Kalmaar]] picks up the broken cuffs when [[Gripe]] barges in and startles him again.)''

'''Gripe''': They have escaped, my Prince! But do not fear. I unleashed the Ripper Sharks upon them.

'''Kalmaar''': You fool! I need them alive! I must have the location of that island!

'''[[Glutinous]]''': Sir! It appears they have been rescued by their friends. My sensors are picking up a vessel.

'''Kalmaar''': What vessel?

'''Glutinous''': The vessel you, um, attempted to sink. It seems to have survived. They repaired it somehow.

'''Kalmaar''': Interesting. It seems these surface-dwellers aren't quite as frail as I thought. How wonderful. Oh, this will be fun.

''(In the [[Hydro Bounty]], Nya and Maya are safely inside.)''

'''Maya''': Thank goodness you all came along. I thought we were done for.

'''Nya''': You said you knew I could save us!

'''Maya''': Well, I didn't want to be a Gloomy Gus, heh ... ''(Just then, an alarm goes off.)''

'''[[P.I.X.A.L.]]''': That's the proximity alarm. I'm afraid we have unannounced visitors.

'''Maaray Guard''': Trespassers, you have illegally entered the domain of King [[Trimaar]], ruler of the [[Endless Sea]] and monarch of [[Merlopia]]. Come peacefully, or you will be fired upon.

'''[[Zane]]''': The ''Hydro Bounty'' is not in any condition to sustain further damage.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': And we are unlikely to be able to outrun those creatures.

'''Lloyd''': Looks like we don't have a choice then.

''(The ninja are escorted into the throne room, with everyone but P.I.X.A.L. carrying an oxygen tank.)''

'''Trimaar''': You have trespassed into my kingdom and risked the peace. Do you have anything to say before I pass judgment?

'''Lloyd''': Well, to be perfectly honest, we didn't know there was an undersea kingdom.

'''Nya''': And we wouldn't have trespassed if it weren't for us being shot down by your son—

'''Trimaar''': What? Is this true?

'''Nya''': Yeah. And not only that, which is enough, really, right? But he also took me and my mother captive!

'''Trimaar''': Captive?

'''Nya''': Oh, it gets worse!

'''Maya''': Yeah, tell him about the giant snake.

'''Nya''': Yeah, yeah. A giant sleeping snake, that your son, Calamari, is trying to wake up.

'''Trimaar''': What sleeping snake?

'''Nya''': [[Wojira]].

'''Trimaar''': ''(Gasps.)'' Bring the Prince and his Mer-servant to me. At once! If these accusations are true, you have my deepest apologies. My son Kalmaar will be disciplined, I assure you. For too long, I have looked the other way and—

'''Kalmaar''': Whatever these surface-dwellers have told you is a lie, Father!

'''Trimaar''': You deny sinking their vessel?

'''Kalmaar''': Oh, that. No, that part is true, I admit it. I've sunken many of their ships. Something ''you'' should have been doing, Father, if you took your duties as king more seriously.

'''Trimaar''': [[Merlopians|We]] live in peace with the surface. We do not bother them, and they do not bother us.

'''Kalmaar''': This world was once ours. Then ''they'' came and despoiled the Endless Sea with their lands and their foul presence. But with the power of Wojira, I can correct this wrong!

'''Maya''': Uh, should we leave?

'''Nya''': Yeah, this is awkward.

'''Kalmaar''': I will do what you should have done long ago. I will return us to our proper glory!

'''Trimaar''': I will not accept this brazen defiance! You have no power here, Kalmaar. I am your father and your king!

'''Kalmaar''': I can't do anything about the first thing, but as to the second ... ''(He blasts Trimaar and the guards, throws the [[Kalmaar's trident|trident]] in front of the ninja, and starts calling for help.)'' Help! Help! The surface-dwellers have attacked the King! Help! Stop them!

'''Lloyd''': Run!

'''Gripe''': Go! Don't let them escape!

'''Maya''': Did you see that? I can't believe he did that! Someone needs to teach that boy a serious lesson.

'''Nya''': I think he needs a little more than a scolding, Mom!

''(Jay zaps two Merlopians, then ducks to avoid their attacks.)''

'''Nya''': ''(To Zane.)'' Ready for the old one-two?

'''Zane''': Affirmative. ''(He and Nya form a giant ice barrier together.)''

''(In the throne room, [[Benthomaar]] enters.)''

'''Benthomaar''': Brother!

'''Kalmaar''': ''Adopted'' brother.

'''Benthomaar''': Is it true? Is Father—

'''Kalmaar''': Sadly, yes. He has been gravely injured by the surface-dwellers. See for yourself.

'''Benthomaar''': Father? We've got to help him!

'''Kalmaar''': I fear he is beyond our help.

'''Benthomaar''': We can't just give up on him! Call the physicians!

'''Kalmaar''': There's no time for that! Let's both help him in our own ways. You by making him comfortable in his final moments. I will help by honoring his last wishes, and destroying the land-walkers who did this to him. Flood the castle and release the Ripper Sharks.

'''Benthomaar''': We can't just leave him here. It's too dangerous.

'''Kalmaar''': Don't worry. People who can breathe only air won't get far down here.

'''Benthomaar''': No, there's still time. ''(He picks Trimaar up and carries him.)'' Hang on, Father. I'll find you help.

''(In the castle, the ninja are still escaping.)''

'''Nya''': This castle is like a maze! Which way is out?

'''Lloyd''': I can't believe we just witnessed a palace coup!

'''Jay''': I can't believe we got blamed for it!

'''Maya''': What's that sound? Do you hear that?

'''Jay''': Sounds like somebody left the tub on.

'''Zane''': The amplitudes are inconsistent with the magnitude of a bathtub. I believe it might be—oh no! ''(He sees water flooding the corridors.)''

'''Nya''': Put your masks on! Fast!

'''Lloyd''': Everyone okay?

'''Maya''': Yeah, I'm okay.

'''Zane''': Affirmative.

'''P.I.X.A.L.''': It appears they did not think we would have rebreathers. Zane? You don't require a breathing device.

'''Zane''': Yes, but I like how it completes my attire.

'''Jay''': Ha! Well, they're gonna have to do better than that if they— ''(He turns to see Ripper Sharks heading towards them.)'' Ah, phooey.

'''Lloyd''': Stay real still. Maybe they won't notice us.

''(Jay screams as the sharks charge at them.)''

'''Nya''': Zane! Freeze it!

'''Jay''': Aha! Try to get past that! ''(singing voice)'' You can't get me, you can't get me —aah!

'''Nya''': Jay!

'''Jay''': Oh, sorry!

'''Lloyd''': I need some help over here! This door won't open!

''(In the corridors, Benthomaar is carrying Trimaar to find help.)''

'''Benthomaar''': I will get you to our physicians, Father, just hold on. Hold on.

'''Trimaar''': No. No time. Listen, Bentho -

'''Benthomaar''': Shh. Save your energy, Father. Don't talk.

'''Trimaar''': Listen, Benthomaar. Listen! You must know the truth.

'''Benthomaar''': What truth?

'''Trimaar''': Put me down. I need to rest. ''(Benthomaar complies.)'' It wasn't the land-dwellers. It was ... it was ...

'''Benthomaar''': Who? Who did this?

'''Trimaar''': Kalmaar did this.

'''Benthomaar''': No. No, he couldn't! He wouldn't.

'''Trimaar''': Promise me, Bentho. Promise me. You will help the surface-dwellers. Help them escape, and stop your brother, before he unleashes calamity upon us.

'''Benthomaar''': I promise, Father. I promise.

'''Trimaar''': You may not have been born to me, Bentho, but you are my son. I love you. ''(Trimaar dies.)''

'''Benthomaar''': I love you too, Father. Father?

''(In the throne room, Kalmaar eagerly picks up the crown when Gripe barges in on him again, and he shrieks, nearly dropping the crown.)''

'''Gripe''': The surface-dwellers have drawn their last breath, Prince Kalmaar.

'''Kalmaar''': Prince no longer ... I am ''King'' Kalmaar! ''(He strikes his trident on the ground, causing everything to glow red.)''

'''Gripe''': Long live the King!

'''Maaray Guards''': ''(Chanting.)'' Long live the King! Long live the King! Long live the King! Long live the King!
