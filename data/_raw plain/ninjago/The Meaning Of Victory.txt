''(In [[Prime Empire]], people are talking, when they hear cheering from a screen.)''

'''Announcer''': We are three days away from the next [[Speedway Five-Billion]]: the fastest and furious race in the world. And this is what it's all about: ''(The screen shows people competing in the Speedway Five-Billion from previous races, then displays a [[Yellow Key-Tana|yellow sword]].)'' the [[Key-Tanas|Key-Tana]]! Truly a prize-worthy of champions. But who will the champion be? Let's meet our racers and find out what victory means to them.

----

'''[[Hyper-Sonic]]''': ''(Shows off his moves.)'' I'm Hyper-Sonic and I'm pumped! I feel the need! I need for velocity!!

'''[[Ritchie]]''': I am Ritchie. I serve my King, [[Atta the Ratta]], for the glory of all [[Rat Pack|rats]]. I will win the Key-Tana.

'''[[Anthony Brutinelli]]''': I'm the Brute. But don't let the name scare you, it's got nothing to do with the intimidating nature of [[ATV|my vehicle]], it's just my given name, "Anthony Brutinelli", the Brute for short. We can't pick our names, can we?

'''[[Racer Seven]]''': ''(Takes off her helmet.)'' I'm Racer Seven. Ever since I can remember, I wanted to be a race car driver and the Speedway is the greatest race in the world. If I can win that, I'll know I was good at something.

'''Hyper-Sonic''': ''(He interrupts Racer Seven and focuses the camera on him.)'' To win a Key-Tana, ''(Whips his arms with speed.)'' you gotta be fast. Like supersonic! Except faster! You gotta be ''Hyper-Sonic''!!

'''Ritchie''': ''(Shoves Hyper-Sonic off screen.)'' Atta the Ratta! Atta the Ratta!

----

'''Racer Seven''': Winning a Key-Tana would be incredible! ''(A few viewers admire her on T.V.)'' Just across the finish line would be amazing!

----

'''Hyper-Sonic''': Hypersonic's the fastest thing in the world, except maybe an exploding volcano. Aw, darn it! ''(The viewers laugh.)'' Hey, can I change my name?

----

'''Announcer''': And what does winning a Key-Tana mean to these racers?

'''Anthony Brutinelli''': Well, it's a validation of my sense of self-worth and makes me feel like I've achieved special. I have some issues I'm trying to work out and I think this might help.

'''Hyper-Sonic''': ''(Pants.)'' It's the most valuable thing in ''Prime Empire''. If you've got a Key-Tana, you've got just anything!

'''Ritchie''': It means glory for Atta the Ratta. Glory for all rats! No longer will rats be seen as flea-ridden, filthy, verminous- ''(Immediately, he starts scratching himself.)''

'''Racer Seven''': Sometimes it feels like we're always playing a role, like someone else is pushing the buttons. Well, I'm tired of that. When I win, it'll be something I did.

'''Announcer''': But what's this? A [[Jay|late entrant]]? A new racer? ''(He starts walking over to the newcomer.)'' Who is this mysterious dark horse? Sir, what does winning the Key-Tana mean to you? Why are you entering the race?

'''Jay''': Why? Because someone has to stop this! This race isn't what anyone thinks! It's all a bigâ€” ''(Gasps. The camera turns to show three [[Red Visors]] shooting, then chasing after Jay.)'' Oh, no! ''(He runs away.)''

'''Red Visor''': You there! ''(One of the Visors switches off the camera.)''

----

'''Announcer''': So tune into the Speedway Five-Billion, the most dangerous race in the world.

''([[Unagami]]'s signature is displayed on the screens. People shrug and move on.)''
