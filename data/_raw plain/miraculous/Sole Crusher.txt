{{Scene|Scene: Taxi. The taxi driver tells [[Zoé Lee]] all about Paris.}}
<poem>
'''Taxi Driver''': You'll discover for yourself, Mademoiselle, but one can never see too much of Paris. ''(displays the [[Eiffel Tower]])'' Does the Eiffel Tower need an introduction? And to think that when it was first built, the Parisians thought it would stuck out like a sore thumb. ''(displays the [[Trocadéro]])'' And over there are the Trocadéro gardens. Did you know that underneath there is an aquarium, the first in the world built in 1867. ''(displays the [[Louvre]])'' The Louvre, the largest museum in the world. So huge that it would take a hundred days to see everything! Originally, the Louvre was a fortress built to protect our city. These days, it protects our art. Speaking of protecting the city, there are our local miracles, Ladybug and Cat Noir!
'''Zoé''': ''(notices the [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie]])'' Can we stop here? I've always dreamed of eating a real Parisian croissant.
'''Taxi Driver''': You couldn't have picked a better place this is the best bakery in Paris. My kids adore their croissants.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie.}}
<poem>
'''[[Sabine Cheng|Sabine]]''': You're lucky they're fresh out of the oven.
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]''': Sorry I got held up here! ''(Trips)''
'''Zoé''': Is everyone all right?
'''Marinette''': Sorry, sorry, sorry!
'''Zoé''': It's totally okay, but maybe I should be asking if you're okay. That was quite a fall!
'''Marinette''': ''(chuckles)'' Don't worry about me, I'll be fine, thanks. I'm pretty clumsy so I'm used to it. Come to think of it, I fall a lot. I fall on my face, fall asleep, fall out of bed, fall apart of the seams fall in love... ''(Zoé laughs)'' I really am sorry about all of this, how can I make it up to you?
'''Zoé''': It's nothing, don't worry!
'''Marinette''': Mom, can you put together a dozen more croissants for...
'''Zoé''': Zoé.
'''Marinette''': Hello, Zoé, I'm Miss Walking Disaster. Where's your accent from? It's really pretty!
'''Zoé''': I'm from [[New York City|New York]].
'''Marinette''': Wow, cool! And what are you doing in Paris?
'''Zoé''': I'm- uh- here to be with my family.
'''Marinette''': Well then it's gonna be a great trip, no matter where you are, if you're with the ones you love, then you feel right at home.
''(Zoé accidently bumps into Marinette)''
'''Zoé''': Sorry.
''(Marinette continues to pick up more apples)''
'''Marinette''': ''(notices Zoé's shoes) Wow, your sneakers are awesome! Did you decorate them yourself?
'''Zoé''': Yeah, I've written every nice thing that anyone's ever said to me, to keep them with me all the time.
'''Marinette''': But there's only one message!
'''Zoé''': I only had one friend.
'''Marinette''': Oh... ''(gets a bunch of pastries for Zoé and places them in a bag)'' If you're not doing anything with your family tonight, my friends are performing a concert on a river march. Let me give you my number! ''(writes her number on one of the pastry boxes)''
'''Zoé''': I can give you mine too if you want. ''(Marinette shows her hand)''
'''Marinette''': This way I won't lose it for sure. ''(Zoé writes her number on Marinette's hand)''
'''Zoé''': Bye!
'''Marinette''': See you tonight!
''(Zoe leaves and goes back in the taxi)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outside of the [[Le Grand Paris]]. Zoé exits the taxi.}}
<poem>
'''Zoé''': ''(gives the bag of pastries to the taxi driver)'' There, share it with your kids.
'''Taxi Driver''': Wow, but don't you want to keep some for your family?
'''Zoé''': Nah, they prefer sour to sweets.
'''Taxi Driver''': Well, thanks, miss. Enjoy your journey.
''(Zoé looks at Marinette's phone number and smiles. She puts the box in her [[Zoé's bag|bag]] and walks to [[Butler Jean]].)''
'''Butler Jean''': Oh, welcome back, Mademoiselle Zoé. Please, follow me.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Le Grand Paris.}}
<poem>
'''Butler Jean''': Pardon me madame, but your daughter Mademoiselle Zoé has arrived.
'''[[Audrey Bourgeois|Audrey]]''': Zoé? ''(looks at Zoé and becomes disgusted)'' Oh, you look terrible! I'm guessing the flight was horrific.
'''Zoé''': Someone in economy class- uh- smelled like disgusting cologne, and the flight attendants refused to open a window to air help the plane!
'''Audrey''': Your father forgot to provide a private jet for you too busy for anyone, as usual. It's fine that you want to come live with us in Paris, but what exactly was wrong with your boarding school again?
'''Zoé''': I- I found roaches in my locker, can you believe it?
'''Audrey''': Well, that's nice, dear. Jean Quinton. Take her to see her sister.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Chloé's room]].}}
<poem>
'''[[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]''': So… you're Zoé? Blonde hair, blue eyes… Good, so far you're measuring up to the family standards, you can make an acceptable sister physically, at least. Cellphone! ''(Zoé hands over [[Zoé's cellphone|her phone]])'' ''(looks at it and throws it away)'' You'll have to change the case. Not enough gold or diamonds! ''(looks at her shoes)'' ''(disgustingly)'' Ah! What are those?! ''(gets a box of shoes and shows it to her)'' See these? These shoes are light and in life, there are winners and losers. Winners have their perfect little feet in these shoes while losers get ''crushed'' ''(closes the box)'' under the soles. So you want them? ''(moves away the box)'' Uh uh uh! If you want to be a winner and be part of this family, you're gonna have to earn your place. But don't worry, I'll be your mentor and if you prove worthy enough to be my sister, well then, maybe…I'll let you borrow my shoes! Rule number one: your father only exists to give you everything you want whenever you want. ''(calls [[André Bourgeois|her father]])'' '''DADDY!''' ''(opens the door)'' ''(to André)'' I want the limo painted pink before I go to school!
'''André''': What? But sweetheart-
'''Chloé''': ''(closes the door)'' Since your father isn't here, you'll use mine! ''If'' you become my sister, of course. Rule number two: you need a minion. Where's yours?
'''Zoé''': Uhhh, I left them…in New York!
'''Chloé''': ''(gasps)'' Fatal mistake! You never go anywhere without your minion! ''(goes to her closet)'' Don't confuse a minion for a patsy which I'll teach you about later. A minion is someone who does everything for you. ''(opens the closet)'' ''(to [[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]])'' Aren't you done with that math homework yet?
'''Sabrina''': Sorry, Chloé. It's taking me a little longer 'cause it's so dark in here but now that my eyes are used to having no light, it'll go much faster! ''(Chloé closes the closet)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Bourgeois's limo.}}
<poem>
'''Chloé''': Now, a patsy is there to suffer for your own entertainment. If you're good enough, a patsy can last you a lifetime. I have an old one but it hasn't been working so well ever since I became a superhero. I got too soft. She's yours if you could do something with her. ''(Zoé looks at Sabrina running while carrying the bags)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] outside. Chloé and Zoé gets out of the limo. Sabrina huffs after running.}}
<poem>
'''Chloé''': Another super important rule. Number 72: All the boys have to be crazy about you carrying your school bag up the stairs should be the highlight of their day. Not you, no, not you, either or you, but you can shine my shoes in your dreams tonight! You! ''(gets Zoé's bag)'' ''(carries it to another boy)'' Here! ''(Zoé walks past him)''
'''Sabrina''': ''(huffs)'' Sorry! ''(gets Zoé's bag)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Collège Françoise Dupont. Sabrina rolls a carpet from the entrance of the school while Marinette and her friends laugh.}}
<poem>
'''Chloé:''' Hey you nobodies! Stop your meaningless chatter for a minute and listen up! This is uh... ''(whispers to Zoé)'' what’s your name again?
'''Zoé''': Zoé.
'''Chloé''': ''(pushes Zoé)'' We’ll buy you a new name later. ''(talking to the crowd again)'' This is Zoé. She’s only my half-sister for now but you must still treat her with respect, so bow down...uh, I mean give her the welcome her status deserves.
'''[[Rose Lavillant|Rose]]''': Her sister? Chloé has a sister?
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]''': If we’re lucky, she’ll only be half as horrible.
'''Marinette''': Relax girls! I met her at the bakery earlier. She’s totally nothing like Chloé. She’s actually really nice! And besides we shouldn’t make snap judgments about people before we get to know them, right? ''(all look at each other)''
'''[[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]]''': ''(from far away; goes to [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]])'' Hey, what's up, man.
'''Chloé''': Ah, rule number 148: obviously, you need a guy BFF to wrap around your finger. Preferably gorgeous and very rich. ''(Adrien and Nino do the handshake)'' That one over there is mine, Adrikins! He's the best there is. So keep your hands off, you here! We'll find you a less handsome one because you're less pretty than me, obviously. ''(Marinette comes)'' Ah! Here comes the patsy I was telling you about. If you can do a number on her, then I'll make you my real sister. Watch and learn. ''(to Marinette)'' Still loafing around, Dupain-Cheng? ''(laughs)'' Hello, she's a baker's daughter, get it? ''(laughs)''
'''Marinette''': Hey, Zoé. What'd you think about the macaroons? Good, huh?
'''Chloé''': ''(to Zoé)'' What?! You know Dupain-Cheng?!
'''Zoé''': ''(slowly to herself)'' Y-yeah, we've met. ''(meanly to Marinette)'' This clueless klutz knocked me down! So she gave me some super, uh… disgusting… macaroons ''(Marinette gets shocked)'' thinking that it would be enough to make up for it, but since I have good taste, I threw them out. ''(Marinette felt sad)''
'''Sabrina''': ''(hugging Zoé's arm)'' Can I do your homework?
''(Zoé felt sad for her.)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Mr. Damocles' office]]. Chloe and Zoe are sitting in front of Principle Damocles.}}
<br /><poem>
'''[[Mr. Damocles]]''': Find a spot. Find a spot! Mid-year admission is not so easy. There's a lot of paperwork-
'''Chloé''': ''(snaps)'' Rule number 38.
'''Zoé''': ''(gets her phone)'' Would you like me to call my stepfather, Mayor Bourgeois, and let him know how utterly useless you've been. So useless, in fact, that this would surely run just as well ''(slams on the desk)'' ''without'' you!
'''Mr. Damocles''': ''(shocked)'' Uhhhh…
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Ms. Mendeleiev's classroom]]. Mr. Damocles is introducing Zoé to their class.}}
<poem>
'''Mr. Damocles''': May I introduce your new schoolmate, Zoé. Please obey, I mean, give her a warm welcome.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Art classroom]]. Marinette and her friends are painting.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(confused)'' I don't understand. When I met her this morning, she was so nice.
'''Alya''': That's crazy. Chloe's influence is so toxic that she's managed to corrupt her sister in a few hours.
'''[[Alix Kubdel|Alix]]''': We gotta get her out of there.
'''[[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]]''': Who will take her in?
'''Rose''': Do you think we can adopt her?
'''Marinette''': Let's just talk to her first. I'll handle it.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Collège Françoise Dupont outside. Chloe and Zoe get into the pink limo.}}
<poem>
'''Chloé''': Needs improvement, but not such a bad start. As a reward, I'll let you touch my diamond shoes when we're home. ''(small laugh)''
'''Zoé''': Thank you? ''(looks outside)''
''(The limo leaves.)''
'''Sabrina''': ''(outside)'' See you later! ''(runs while carrying the bags)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. Marinette is texting Zoé.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Why did she become so nasty when she was so nice before?
'''[[Daizzi]]''': Maybe she was…hungry?
'''Marinette''': I'm sure the real Zoé is the one I met the first time. I hope I can get to the bottom of this.
'''[[Tikki]]''': As long as you're acting with kindness, Marinette, you can't go wrong.
'''[[Mullo]]''': Mm-hmm.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Chloé's room. Chloe is searching through her closet, throwing shoes out of it. Marinette is texting Zoé.}}
<poem>
'''Chloé:''' No. ''(throws a shoe)'' No. ''(Throws another shoe) (Zoé, sitting at the end of Chloé's bed, gets a text message as Chloé continues to search for shoes. She sees it is a message from Marinette, and reads.)''
'''Marinette:''' ''(voiceover)'' I can tell something is keeping you from being yourself. If it's Chloé, we can talk about it tonight, if you want. You're still welcome to come to the Barge.
''(Zoé smiles, but looks up to see Chloé still throwing shoes around.)''
'''Chloé:''' ''(off-screen)'' Ridiculous! ''(a shoe hits the ground)''
''(Zoé texts Marinette back.)''
'''Zoé:''' ''(internal voiceover as she types)'' Sorry. I'll explain tonight. ''(sends the message, Marinette's picture and name pops up as she does)''
'''Chloé:''' ''(sees Zoé messaging)'' Are you texting Dupain-Cheng?! I warned you! You walk over people, or I walk over you! Either you're proud to be who you are, proud to be a part of ''my'' family and you walk in ''my'' footsteps, or you ''clear out''!
'''Zoé:''' ''Are you through''? This is all just part of my plan! I trick Dupain-Cheng into thinking I'm her friend, and tonight at the Barge I'll throw her disgusting macarons into [[Seine|the Seine]], in front of all of her friends! Total humiliation.
'''Chloé:''' ''(gasps, smiles)'' Brilliant! Utterly brilliant! ''(puts a pair of diamond encrusted gold shoes in Zoé's hands. She jumps on her bed with a journal and a pen.)'' So, how about 'stick a wad of chewing gum on her chair'? No, done that. Oh! 'Get her punished for something she didn't do'! Too easy. ''(gasps)'' Roaches! ''(Zoé looks horrified. Chloé sits up on her bed.)'' Roaches in her locker! Yes! ''(Zoé tries to sneak away with a haunted look)'' How amazing am ''I''?'' (notices Zoé walking away)'' Hey! ''(Zoé stops)'' Where are you going?!
'''Zoé:''' I'm... ''(turns to Chloe with a positive expression)'' going to try them on outside. ''(lifts the shoes)'' I want to see the diamonds sparkle in the sunlight.
''(Zoé walks away with a hidden sad expression, while Chloé goes back to scheming in her journal.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Le Grand Paris, rooftop. Zoe looks over the street. She is about to throw the shoes off, but she stops. She puts her head on the rooftop railing. André Bourgeois is hiding, looking at Zoé with a sad expression on his face.}}
<poem>
'''André:''' ''(walks up to Zoé)'' Is everything okay, Zoé?
''(Zoé wipes the tears from her eyes, and smiles.) ''
'''André:''' ''(smiling)'' When I was young, I wanted to make movies, ''(background changes to a film reel, images popping up as he speaks)'' tell stories. Ah, that was the real me. ''(the images are scribbled off, and background changes to André being interviewed in front of the French flag with Audrey and Butler Jean.)'' But it made very clear to me that in order to earn my place, ''(background disappears)'' I had to let certain dreams go. ''(to Zoé)'' What about you? What are ''your'' dreams?
'''Zoé:''' At first, I– I wanted to be an actress. ''(looks down)'' I'm good at acting. Then I found myself acting all the time, playing these different roles trying to please everyone, until I couldn't do it anymore. ''(André looks down in sympathy)'' I just want to be accepted for being me, the real me. ''(covers her eyes with her arm)'' And now it's happening all over again, I just can't...
'''André:''' ''(hand on her shoulder)'' Let me show you something. ''(takes her to the cellar on the roof and opens it)'' I call this "My Cellar of Dreams." ''(in the cellar has a camera, some film reels, a Solitude script among many others, and three film booklets with [[Emilie Agreste]] on one of them which he picks up)'' It can be lonely when even your own family can't accept you for who you are. ''(holding the booklet to his chest)'' We end up burying out feelings deep, here. ''(puts the booklet back in the cellar)'' And here. ''(turns to Zoé)'' If you want, I can make some space for you.
''(Zoé flashbacks to Chloé.)''
'''Chloé:''' ''(flashback)'' I warned you: either you walk over people, or I walk over you!
''(Zoé looks down at her shoes sadly. Then a resigned look. She puts the shoes in the cellar. She looks down, hurt, as the cellar door closes.)''

'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Sole Crusher, I am Shadow Moth. Your sister challenges you to measure up to her? I give you the power to crush her soul instead. From now on, every person you crush will make you stronger.
'''Zoé''': ''(stands up)'' They'll be crushed under the soles of my shoes, all the same.
'''Shadow Moth''': All that I ask for in return are Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous. Start walking, Sole Crusher!

'''Chloé:''' ''(grins; turns to Sole Crusher)'' If you want to be my sister, if you really want to be like ''me'', then I'm not the one you should crush. ''(points to the people on the Liberty)'' They are! ''(they gasp)'' Those losers! Otherwise you'll go back to New York! You may be bigger now, but you're still just a ridiculous copy of me! Utterly ridiculous!
'''Marinette:''' That's not true! You don't have to crush anyone! There's no such things as winners, or losers! There's just.. people, with all unique interests and other individualities!
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(jumps onto a rooftop)'' Did someone start off on the wrong foot this morning?
'''Marinette:''' ''(to Chat Noir)'' I'm not finished. ''(turns to Sole Crusher)'' Zoé! No one will judge you here. You can just be yourself. You might trip, you might fall, and there'll always be someone to pick you back up. ''I'll'' always be there for you!

Chloé is hiding under the bridge of the Seine when Cat Noir extends his staff to Sole Crusher's neck, who grabs it and throws it and Chat Noir to fly. He grabs onto a light pole to stop himself from falling. Ladybug extends her yo-yo and wraps its around Sole Crusher's right ankle, causing the villain to crash into the nearby buildings.

'''Cat Noir:''' Let me trip her up a bit, m'lady. Cataclysm! 
''(Sole Crusher regains her balance, and Cat Noir destroys a part of her right shoe's heel, breaking it and causing the villain to fall.

<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(to Ladybug)'' Don't you find it strange that Sole Crusher didn't follow us here?
'''Ladybug:''' Let's make a run for it. ''(they run to the cellar)''
'''André:''' ''(reaches for the cellar) (to Ladybug and Cat Noir)'' Promise you won't tell my wife about this? ''(they nod)''
'''Sole Crusher:''' ''(twice the size of Le Grand Paris)'' You can't measure up ''to me''! I'm going to crush. You. All! 
''(Sole Crusher starts to throw her right fist as a punch. She yells in anger.)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(tries to open the cellar, but it's stuck. She struggles, but realises)'' Of course! ''(take the shoe horn Lucky Charm to open the cellar door. As Sole Crusher's fist is flaming and about to reach them, Ladybug finds the akumatized sneaker and breaks it. The Akuma flies out and stops Sole Crusher, who returns back to Zoé.) (opens her yo-yo)'' No more evil doing for you little akuma. Time to de-evilize! (''catches the akuma'') Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly! (''throws the shoe horn into the air'') [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]! ''(the streets are repaired, and the people in Le Grand Paris restaurant are restored)''
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir:''' ''(as Zoé wakes up on a pool chaise)'' Pound it!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(opens her yo-yo and pulls out a Magical Charm) ''This is a magical charm, Zoé. (puts it in her hand) With it, Shadow Moth can't get to you any longer. Always keep it with you to remember what you overcame today.
'''Zoé:''' Thank you, Ladybug. You really are Miraculous.
'''Ladybug:''' ''(smiles)'' Bug out! ''(she and Cat Noir jump off the rooftop. Zoé watches them leave.)''

'''Marinette:''' Let me introduce you to everyone. Guys. ''(the music stops)'' This is Zoé. She just arrived here from New York.  
'''Adrien:''' Hi.
'''Luka:''' Hi.
'''Mylène:''' Hello.
'''Zoé:''' I'm... really sorry about today. I thought that if I did everything Chloé wanted me to, she'd accept me. I just wanted to meet my family's expectations. Which is why I left New York in the first place. At the boarding school, I was playing a part; being someone else, hoping they'd accept me. But finally, I just couldn't anymore. That's when everyone turned against me, and one day, I found roaches in my locker. They all said I was a loser. Maybe they were right. I get that I'm different, and... I'd understand if you guys didn't want me as a friend.
''(Ivan smiles and gets up from his drum kit. He hugs Zoé with everyone around her.)''
'''Mylène:''' We're all one big, happy family. 
'''Rose:''' You'll be fine with us!
''(Ivan releases Zoé from the hug.)''
'''Marinette:''' You'll never have to leave again, Zoé. Welcome to Paris.
''(Zoé opens the box of macarons.)''

<poem>
'''Chloé:''' (to André) Daddy! Order her to return my shoes at once! (André nervously raises his arms, but Zoé lifts the shoes and Chloé snatches them.) And I demand she be sent back to New York ''immediately''! Exactly the way she came!
'''André:''' Of course, of course! However, uh...
'''Audrey:''' Is there a problem, André?
'''André:''' Well, what I mean is: with all the paperwork needed to enrol her in another boarding school, we won't be rid of her for months. Maybe we could just, er... put her somewhere else...?
'''Chloé:''' ''(she and Audrey have their arms crossed)'' In the cellar.
'''André:''' Excellent idea, in the cellar. Or at least a room in another wing of the hotel...?
'''Chloé:''' Well! A smaller room than mine!
'''André:''' Of course! Miniscule. Barely even the size of a junior suite!
'''Chloé:''' And see to it that we never cross paths again!
'''André:''' ''(opening Chloé's door and pushing Zoé out)'' She'll take the service elevator with the staff. ''(closes the door) (turns to Zoé)''
'''Zoé:''' Thank you. Promise me that you won't leave your dreams too long down in that cellar.
'''André:''' I promise. Come on. (they walk to the elevator) You're going to ''love'' your new room.
