{{Scene|Scene: Inside the Agreste car, the [[Butterfly Miraculous]] on Gabriel flashes as it senses a negative emotion.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': Adrien, I'm not just feeling well enough. You will have to represent me.
'''[[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]]''': But Father, you're launching your hundredth collection tonight! You're the one the journalists want to interview, not me.
'''Gabriel''': ''(fidgets with his ring)'' Adrien, I am your father, and I am giving you the responsibility to attend this press conference. Under no circumstances will you leave that room until it's finished. All I'm asking is that you honor my work and the memory of your mother. Do we have an agreement?
'''Adrien''': Yes, Father.
</poem>

<poem>
''(A journalist raises her hand.)''

{{Scene|Scene: The Parisian streets. [[Bob Roth|Moolak]] fires at the Parisians and turns them into coins inside his vault.}}
<poem>
'''Moolak''': ''(laughs)'' My money-making lasers are gonna make me even richer!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Bring me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous, Moolak!
'''Moolak''': Depends on how much these trinkets are worth!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' How much is your power which I can take back from you in an instant worth to you?
'''Moolak''': ''(groans)'' A guy can't even strike a bargain these days!
''(Ryuko's whirlwind strikes from outside of Moolak's vault and electrifies it. The superhero team chases after Moolak on the rooftops.)''
'''Moolak''': ''(laughs evilly)'' You'll never get your hands on my lucky coin!
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]]''': We have to get to Moolak if we're gonna defeat him! Pegasus, use your power now!
'''[[Max Kanté|Pegasus]]''': [[Voyage]]!! ''(He attempts to enter the portal he's made, only to be blocked by a pile of coins. He coughs out the coins inside his mouth.)'' I can't teleport! The safe is so filled up with coins, there's no room!
'''[[Zoé Lee|Vesperia]]''': It'd be simpler just to cataclysm the whole safe!
'''Ladybug''': I know! I already left I don't know how many messages for Cat Noir!
</poem> 
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, the [[Grand Palais]]. The interview is still on hold. Adrien overlooks the battle above the clear roof of the venue.}}

'''Moolak''': ''(laughs)'' I'm getting so rich!!
'''Nathalie''': ''(from the earpiece)'' Adrien, your father is counting on you!
'''Adrien''': Next question!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The Parisian streets. The battle continues. Ladybug continues to contact Cat Noir but fails.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir's voicemail''': You can ''purr'' your message after the "meow"! Meow!
''(Ladybug puts down her bug phone and activates her power.)
'''Ladybug''': [[Lucky Charm]]!
''(A [[List of Lucky Charm objects#Season 4|firetruck]] drops in front of Ladybug. She comes up with a plan to use her Lucky Charm. Her Lucky vision highlights Moolak, the firetruck's ladder, Vesperia, Polymouse, Purple Tigress, Viperion, and Carapace.)''
'''Ladybug''': Got it!
''(Ladybug hurls her yo-yo around Moolak.)''
'''Ladybug''': Gear up, guys!
'''Polymouse''': [[Multitude]]!
''(Polymouse multiplies and Moolak fires at her clones, while Purple Tigress and Pigella throw Vesperia towards Moolak.)''
'''Vesperia''': [[Venom]]!
'''Moolak''': Nice try! ''(fires at Vesperia)''
'''Carapace''': [[Shell-ter]]! ''(shields Vesperia, protecting her from Moolak's shots)''
'''Moolak''': Blasted super nerds!
'''Carapace''': Unshield!
''(Vesperia immpobilizes the safe and bounces off.)''
'''Ladybug''': Viperion, try every possible combination!
'''Viperion''': [[Second Chance]]!
''(Viperion tries the codes from 0000 to 0003 but fails, reverting time with each try.)''
'''Ladybug''': Viperion, try every possible combination!
'''Viperion''': Second Chance!
''(Viperion tries the code 0099, which grants access to open the safe.)''
'''Viperion''': Jackpot! And it only took me a hundred tries!
''(Viperion opens the safe and coins fall out, along with Moolak. Ladybug catches the coin.)''
'''Moolak''': Noooo!
''(Ladybug cracks the coin and frees the akuma.)''

''(The lair window closes shut.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sewers.}}
<poem>
'''Viperion''': Scales rest. ''(de-transforms into Luka)''
'''Ladybug''': Thanks, Luka—
''(Ladybug reaches for Luka's hand, but [[Su-Han]] grabs her arm.)''
'''Su-Han''': This really takes the cake!
'''Ladybug''': Grand Master Su-Han?
'''Su-Han''': Nine! You used nine Miraculouses to defeat a single villain, when Cat Noir could have just used his Cataclysm!
'''Ladybug''': I had to, Cat Noir was missing!
'''Su-Han''': What do you mean missing? You can't just let the holder of the most powerful Miraculous go about as he pleases! What if he started making his own decisions, or act it out? Like Shadow Moth!
'''Ladybug''': Cat Noir? Act like Shadow Moth? Wow. Are you blowing this out of proportion just a little?
'''Su-Han''': Not at all. In fact, you should find out who Cat Noir really is, so you can have better control over him.
'''Ladybug''': What? No way! We can't know our true identities! It would be too dangerous if Shadow Moth got a hold of one of us!
'''Su-Han''': I. Don't. Care!! Deal with this problem quickly, otherwise I will take back his Miraculous as soon as he shows a whisker! And I'll choose the new Cat Noir myself!
'''Ladybug''': Okay, okay, alright. What if you knew who he was, would that work?
'''Su-Han''': I... I suppose so. But I'm warning you, if you don't succeed...
'''Ladybug''': I get it. Cat Noir will be replaced.
''(Su-Han grunts while hopping away.)''
'''Luka''': Are you really going to do as he asks?
'''Ladybug''': Do I really have a choice in the matter? I can't fight the Celestial Guardian, and I don't want the risk of losing our Cat Noir. I'm gonna need both of you.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, the [[Agreste mansion]], in Adrien's bathroom. Adrien opens his shower. Plagg zooms out of his jacket.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': I hope Ladybug didn't need me. Plagg, claws out! ''(transforms into Cat Noir)''
''(He opens his cat phone.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Fourteen messages? She must be furious. ''(calls Ladybug)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(on the phone)'' Finally! 
'''Cat Noir''': I know what you're about to say, Ladybug, but—
'''Ladybug''': ''(on the phone)'' Nevermind! We got through it. That's all that matters. But we ''do'' need to talk. Meet me at the top of the Eiffel Tower.
'''Cat Noir''': ''(puts down the phone)'' I get the feeling I'll have my whiskers yanked. 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sewers. A wall separates both Luka and Marinette to hide their secret identities.}} <!-- though it's not hidden to Luka anymore lol -->
<poem>
'''Luka''': I'm wondering, Ladybug. How do you plan to reveal Cat Noir's identity to Su-Han if you don't know who he is?
'''Marinette''': Remember why you must all ignore who Cat Noir and I really are? 
'''Luka''': So Shadow Moth leaves us alone when we're not superheroes? If we don't know who you are, we're no interest to him.
'''Marinette''': Yes. But in fact, if worse comes to worst, a Miraculous holder could know Cat Noir's identity or mine, but not both. 
'''Luka''': That way, there'd always be one of you to fight Shadow Moth!
'''Marinette''': Exactly! But for Cat Noir and me, it's different. If we knew each other's identities, all would take is just for one of us to be akumatized to betray the other. 
'''Luka''': And Shadow Moth would win.
'''Marinette''': Tikki, spots on! ''(transforms into Ladybug)''
'''Luka''': Sass, scales slither! ''(transforms into Viperion)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sewers, Ladybug explains her plan to Viperion.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': This is the plan: you stay here hidden. I ask Cat Noir his identity. He tells me...
'''Viperion''': Since I'll hear everything, I'll also know his name.
'''Ladybug''': That's when you'll use your power of Second Chance to go back in time. I'll forget everything but ''you'' won't.
'''Viperion''': Or I could just ask him myself if you want. It'd be less dangerous that way, wouldn't it?
'''Ladybug''': ''(grabbing her earpiece from her yo-yo)'' Cat Noir will only tell if I'm the one asking.
'''Viperion''': Alright, and then I'll tell the Celestial Guardian Cat Noir's identity.
'''Ladybug''': And then he'll finally got me some slack. 
'''Viperion''': Are you sure the fact that I know who Cat Noir is won't be a problem?
'''Ladybug''': Like I said, as long as I don't know who he is, everything will be fine.
''(Viperion smiles.)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On top of the [[Eiffel Tower]], Ladybug waits for Cat Noir.}}
<poem>
'''Viperion''': ''(through the earpiece)'' Do you think Cat Noir would agree to this?
'''Ladybug''': ''(groans)'' He's been dying to tell me who he is for the longest time. ''(looks over the fence and sees Cat Noir leaping on the rooftops towards the Eiffel Tower)'' There he is! Get ready!
''(Ladybug and Viperion's timers reach at one in the morning.)''
'''Ladybug''': Now! We're in sync!
'''Viperion''': Second Chance!
''(Ladybug and Viperion start their timers at five minutes.)''
'''Ladybug''': The countdown has begun. It's 1 am, and we've got just five minutes before you transform back. So we've got to be done by 1:05. You'll rewind on my signal.
'''Cat Noir''': ''(upon landing on top of the Eiffel Tower)'' I'm sorry, but I really couldn't make it earlier.
'''Ladybug''': ''(waves)'' Hey, no big deal! That's the good thing about a team. It's not the two of us anymore! 
'''Cat Noir''': Oh, yeah! So then, why did you need me exactly?
'''Ladybug''': Well... actually, it's kind of linked to what happened today. I've given it a lot of thought ever since I became guardian, you know? ''(leans on the fence)'' And, I've realized that... you were right after all. ''(turns to Cat Noir)'' We should tell each other our secret identities. 
'''Cat Noir''': But, aren't the secrets supposed to protect us?
'''Ladybug''': I thought so. But when you didn't show up today, I didn't know how to locate you because we can't communicate when we're not transformed. If something bad happened to one of us when we're not heroes, we could know about it. It would make us stronger. We'd be able to defeat Shadow Moth quicker! 
'''Cat Noir''': ''(walks towards Ladybug's side)'' So, we're doing this, for real?
'''Ladybug''': Yes.
'''Cat Noir''': Wow. Okay. You go ahead, m'lady. Guardians first!
'''Ladybug''': No, you first. 
'''Cat Noir''': Let's do it together.
''(Viperion listens to their conversation while he's in the sewers.)''
'''Ladybug''': No, I mean it. You go first. I'm... feeling kind of... awkward. 
''(The timer on Viperion's lyre indicate almost a minute left.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Fine. I'm... I'm... Adrien Agreste.
'''Ladybug''': ''(bursts into laughter)'' And I'm Audrey Bourgeois! ''(continues laughing)'' You? Adrien Agreste? There's no way! You two aren't alike ''at all!''
'''Cat Noir''': Claws in. ''(de-transforms into Adrien)''
''(Ladybug's eyes widened.)'' 
'''Adrien''': See? It's really me, Adrien Agreste. What about you?
''(Ladybug remains to be dumbfounded.)''
'''Viperion''': ''(through the communicator)'' Ladybug! I heard his name! Shall I rewind?
'''Ladybug''': No— Wait— Not— Not yet. 
'''Adrien''': ''(frowns)'' I understand. It's never easy to show your true self to someone. You'd wonder what the other person would think of you if they'll like you. It's hard for me, too, you know? My heart's beating so fast, I've waited for this moment for so long! Imagine the stories that I have come up with when you saved my life as Adrien, or when you wanted to give me another Miraculous! It was awful having to hide Cat Noir from you. I'm so glad I don't have to do that anymore! I hope you're not too disappointed. But whoever you are behind that mask, you'll always be the most amazing person in the world.
'''Viperion''': ''(from the earpiece)'' Ladybug! We're almost out of time! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sewers, Viperion's timer hits 00:00.}}
<poem>
'''Viperion''': Oh no, there's no going back now. 
''(He de-transforms into Luka, and catches [[Sass]] on his hands.)''
'''Luka''': I hope she knows what she's doing.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On top of the [[Eiffel Tower]], Ladybug attempts to reveal her identity.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': ''(hesitantly)'' I am... Ma— Ma— Mari— madly awkward! 
'''Adrien''': Take all the time you need. I'll wait 'til you're ready. Besides, now that you know who I am, you know where to find me!
'''Ladybug''': Uhh, right! I'll take my think to time— er— uh— see you sooner! ''(swings away)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sewers, Luka returns the Snake Miraculous to Ladybug.}}
<poem>
'''Luka''': What made you change your mind?
'''Ladybug''': I... guess I'm just curious to see what's gonna happen. After that...
'''Luka''': But you said it was too dangerous to know his identity.
'''Ladybug''': As long as Cat Noir doesn't know who I am, it'll be okay. And I'm gonna make sure of that, starting with Grand Master Su-Han.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On the rooftops, Ladybug explains to Su-Han that Cat Noir could not know Ladybug's identity. They come into agreement and went on their ways.}}
{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. Marinette sits in front of her board full of pictures of her friends.}}
<poem>
'''Tikki''': This is wonderful! Since Cat Noir's in love with Ladybug, that means he's in love with you! You and Adrien can finally be together!
'''Marinette''': ''(grabs the picture of Adrien from her board)'' It's not that simple, Tikki. I'm in love with Adrien, but I've never been in love with Cat Noir. ''(lies down on her bed)'' It's as if they are two completely different people! Is the Adrien I'm in love with the fake Adrien? Is Cat Noir the "real" Adrien? Who's the real Adrien behind Adrien?
'''Tikki''': I don't know. Why don't you ask Alya?
'''Marinette''': I can't. She already knows I'm Ladybug. She can never know that Adrien is Cat Noir. It'd be too dangerous. 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, the [[Agreste mansion]], Adrien's room.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': ''(while climbing his rock climbing wall)'' When she's ready, she will tell me who she is! In the meantime, she'll get to know me! ''(slides down the stairs)'' And then, who knows? ''(rides his swivel chair across his room)'' I'm so char-meow-ing after all!
'''Plagg''': I usually like smelly cheese, but I get the feeling that this is gonna turn into some really really stinky cheese. ''(eats a piece of camembert)''
'''Adrien''': Woohoohooo!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Collège Françoise Dupont]], Ms. Bustier's Classroom.}}
<poem>
'''[[Caline Bustier|Ms. Bustier]]''': Who can tell me who wrote "I Am a Cat"?
'''Adrien''': Meow meow?
''(The whole class laughs, except for Marinette.)''
'''Adrien''': Or in human language, Natsume Sōseki.
''(Adrien turns to Cat Noir in Marinette's point of view.)''
'''Adrien''': He wrote the book "I Am a Cat". Sorry for the joke, Ms. Bustier!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Collège Françoise Dupont, in the locker room.}}
<poem>
''(Adrien bumps into Marinette.)''
'''Marinette''': Sorry, I'm so madly awkward. Uh— I mean clumsy. I'm madly clumsy—

''(Marinette wakes up and yawns. As she turns to the board with pictures of Adrien, it quickly turns into Cat Noir in her point of view. She goes out of the bakery and bumps into a poster of Adrien. She runs away, with all the other posters of Adrien turning into Cat Noir.)''

'''Luka''': I feel like you're not hearing the same tune anymore when you look at Adrien.
'''Adrien''': ''(to Kitty Section)'' I think that song sounded great!
'''Marinette''': Luka, have you ever thought you knew a person really well only to find out that they have a secret side to them that you couldn't possibly imagine?
'''Luka''': Yes.
'''Marinette''': And, did it... completely change your way of seeing them? Like all of a sudden, everything feels strange 'cause you don't really know them anymore?
'''Luka''': Quite the opposite, actually. Once I got over the shock, it helped me to get to know them better, and liked them even more. ''(stands from his seat)''
''(As Luka walked away, in Marinette's point of view, she still sees Adrien as Cat Noir. But as Luka walked across her sight of Adrien, he is seen as his normal self. Marinette smiles at the view.)''

''(Adrien starts to blush as his heart beats faster and faster.)''

''(She de-transforms into Marinette, leaving an awestruck and blushing Adrien in front of her.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(flustered)'' Please, say something! 
''(Adrien remains dazed.)''

'''Sass''': You can't, but I can. I can go back to any temporal marker that has been placed in the past.

''([[Jeanne d'Arc]] appears behind them.)''
'''Jeanne d'Arc''': Hark, what are those voices I hear? Bertrand? Gilles? My, what sorcery is this? ''(groans)''
''(Jeanne d'Arc tries to tackle them, but disappears in time.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Time has gone crazy! Or maybe I have...
'''Ladybug''': I have a bad feeling about this. Viperion! Viperion, can you hear me? Follow me!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sewers. Viperion is having trouble communicating with Ladybug.}}
<poem>
'''Viperion''': Ladybug, can you hear me?
'''Ladybug''': Viperion! I've gotta talk to Sass!
'''Viperion''': Scales rest! ''(de-transforms into Luka)''
'''Sass''': I'm so sorry, Ladybug, I had no choice!
'''Ladybug''': What happened?
'''Sass''': I'm not really sure. I just saw a photo of a lucky charm, a watch showing 1 am.
'''Cat Noir''': Do you understand any of this?
'''Ladybug''': When kwamis use their power without a holder, it always has magical and disastrous consequences. And Sass's power is to turn back time!
'''Cat Noir''': So time has gotten all mixed up!
'''Ladybug''': Stay here, Luka!

{{Scene|Scene: The Parisian streets. Multiple time anomalies appear everywhere.}}
<poem>
'''[[Anarka Couffaine|Captain Hardrock]]''': Liberty! Next stop, city hall!
''(Near the Eiffel Tower, [[Max Kanté|Gamer]] appears. On the Montparnasse Tower, [[Adrien's bodyguard|Gorizilla]] appears to be surrounded by helicopters.)''
'''Ladybug''': Woah, I'm getting major Déjà vu right now!
'''Cat Noir''': It's time to have a genius idea, m'lady!
'''Ladybug''': Lucky Charm!
''(Ladybug uses her power to summon a Lucky Charm, and a [[List of Lucky Charm objects#Season 4|scale weight]] appears.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Do you think this will be enough to tip the balance of time?
'''Ladybug''': Oh, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures! This organization coordinates the hours of the whole world with its satellite! It's right near Paris!
'''Cat Noir''': Which means the satellite is just above our heads! We fix it, we fix all the connected devices that depend on time to function! How are we going to know the exact time to program into the satellite?
'''Ladybug''': Thanks to this countdown, I still have a way to know what time it is for real. When it gets to the end, that'll mean that it's exactly 1:05 am. That's what we'll program into the satellite. Time to suit up!
'''Cat Noir''': Mmm. But, what's the plan with all the apparitions?
'''Ladybug''': Leave them to my magical ladybugs.
<center> '''''[Transformation Sequence]''''' <br> '''Cat Noir''': Power up! </br> ''(Cat Noir transforms into Astro Cat)''</center>
'''Ladybug''': Let's sync up our stopwatches.
''(Ladybug and Astro Cat sync up their stopwatches.)''
'''Astro Cat''': Now I have exactly the same countdown as you.
<center> '''''[Transformation Sequence]''''' <br> '''Ladybug''': Power up! </br> ''(Ladybug transforms into Cosmobug)''</center>
'''Cosmobug''': Ready, Astro Cat?
'''Astro Cat''': Ready, Cosmobug!
'''Cosmobug''': Okay, take off!
''(Cosmobug and Astro Cat fly up to outer space.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outer space. Cosmobug and Astro Cat fix the satellite.}}
<poem>
'''Cosmobug''': [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]!
''(Cosmobug uses her power, and everything returns back to normal.)''
'''Cosmobug and Astro Cat''': Pound it!
'''Astro Cat''': ''♪ Meow, meow, meow... Meow-meow! ♪''
'''Cosmobug''': That's a pretty tune, what is it?
'''Astro Cat''': A classical piece. Thus spoke Catathustra. By the way, what did you wanna talk about earlier, up on the Eiffel Tower?
'''Cosmobug''': Oh, nothing important. Forget about it.
'''Astro Cat''': Hmm. Atta blast!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Dupain-Cheng residence, balcony. Su-Han is waiting.}}
<poem>
'''Cosmobug''': Spots off!
''(She de-transforms into Ladybug.)''
'''Su-Han''': So, do you know who Cat Noir is yet?
'''Ladybug''': No.
'''Su-Han''': What? I thought I had warned you—
'''Ladybug''': I don't want to know. I've proven to you a hundred times that I'm a good guardian, and Cat Noir and I have proven to you a hundred times that we were exceptional superheroes, and you! How many times have you told us that we were messing up, when that was totally untrue? You're judging us based on your own fears, and not on our actions!
'''Su-Han''': ''(groans)'' You're right, little Ladybug. Perhaps I'm worrying over nothing. What's for sure is that one doesn't come across a guardian like you every century. ''(reaches out his fist)'' How do you say again?
'''Ladybug and Su-Han''': Pound it.
