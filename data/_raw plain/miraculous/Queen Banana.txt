'''[[Xuppu]]:''' I'll bet you anything it's a tablecloth for a picnic.
'''Marinette:''' Not even close, Xuppu. It's a cape. ''(She gets up.)'' This one's for the superhero of creation. ''(Walks over to a red cape.)'' This one's for the supervillain of destruction.
'''Xuppu:''' Capes for [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] and Ladybug?
'''Marinette:''' No, it's for a movie. ''(The [[Kwamis|kwamis]] ooh.)'' You know, those make-believe stories they show on TV?
'''[[Orikko]]:''' Are you gonna be famous?
'''Marinette:''' No, I'm the costume designer, I'm not acting in it. We ''are'' gonna be on the news. ''(Gasps.)'' I'm gonna be late! ''(She grabs two flashlights and leaves.)''

<poem>
'''[[Nadja Chamack|Nadja]]:''' And now, the very original project coming from the [[Collège Françoise Dupont|Françoise Dupont school]] in [[Paris]]. [[Clara Contard]] reporting.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Françoise Dupont highschool. [[Art classroom]]. The students are getting ready for the movie.}}
<poem>
'''Clara:''' Under the initiative of the art teacher, [[Jean-Pierre Monlataing]], one of Françoise Dupont school's alumni, [[Thomas Astruc (character)|Thomas Astruc]], who's become a successful film director, is participating in an ambitious project. ''(Thomas Astruc shows [[Zoé Lee|Zoé]] and [[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]] how to use the swords.)'' He's overseeing this group of students who are volunteering their own vacation time to produce a real-life movie. ''([[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]] and Jean-Pierre supervise [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Nathaniel]] as he draws.)'' From script to storyboard, not to mention costumes, ''([[Rose Lavillant|Rose]] admires Marinette's costumes)''—everything's being done by the students themselves ''([[Alix Kubdel|Alix]] paints a sword green.)'' with financial support from Paris' [[Hôtel de Ville|city hall]].
'''[[André Bourgeois|André]]:''' Yes; you know, I myself directed a few in my youth, and—
'''Clara:''' And the cherry on top is that the film will be released in select movie theaters thanks to famous producer [[Bob Roth]]. ''(An image of him appears, and André peeps from behind. Rose and Marinette help Mylène and Zoé with their costumes.)'' What a lucky break for these student-filmmakers, as well as for the two young actresses who'll be starring in the main role!
'''Zoé:''' ''(reading script)'' You may hate me, but I love you, and I always will!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]'s [[Chloé's room|room]] in [[Le Grand Paris]].}}
<poem>
'''Chloé:''' ''(throws banana peel at the screen with Zoé)'' A film with my half-of-a-sister as the star?! Ridiculous!
'''[[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]]:''' ''(offering a banana from a bowl)'' Do you want another banana, Chloé? I've heard they help put people in a better mood.
'''Chloé:''' ''(grabbing the banana)'' What I want is to go tell that bunch of lamoes how things work in real life! ''(She walks off. Sabrina runs after her.)'' In ''my'' life.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Art classroom. Zoé and Mylène are rehearsing.}}
<poem>
'''Zoé:''' You may hate me, but I love you, and I always will—
'''Chloé:''' ''(slamming the door open)'' How dare you all! Giving the lead role to my half-of-a-sister who just came out of nowhere?! And with daddy's money, on top of it all.
'''André:''' Uh, it's not actually funded by ''me'', sweetheart, but by the city.
'''Chloé:''' Same thing. ''(Walks over to Zoé.)'' You—I told you that you'd be sent back to [[New York City|New York]] if you ever crossed my path, and now, not only are you on my path, but on TV, too!
'''Marinette:''' Don't let your sister walk all over you, Zoé. You are made for this part, you deserve it!
'''Thomas:''' It's true, and we're meeting with the producer tomorrow, so it's too late to change anything now.
'''Jean-Pierre:''' Might I remind you that you were offered a chance, like all the students in the school, to participate in the film, but you refused because, and I quote, "Mylène's sweater is too ugly, Nate draws like a 2-year-old, [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] is useless and Marinette is ridiculous, utterly ridiculous"?
'''Chloé:''' I said that?
'''Jean-Pierre:''' Less politely.
'''Chloé:''' Well, I still mean all of it. But if this stupid, childish film actually gets released in theaters and turns someone into a star, that someone should be me. So, you're gonna give me the part my half-of-a-sister is playing because everything she owns is mine. ''(She walks off.)''
'''Sabrina:''' Banana, Chloé? ''(She follows her.)''
'''André:''' Don't worry, kids, I'll go talk to her, everything will be fine tomorrow. ''(He closes the door and runs after Chloé. Marinette and Zoé look at each other.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Bob Roth's office. The students enter with Thomas Astruc in the lead.}}
<poem>
'''Thomas:''' And here's the office of the producer, Bob Roth.
'''Chloé:''' ''(spins around in the chair)'' Surprise! ''(The rest gasp.)''
'''Marinette:''' ''(runs over)'' Chloé, what are ''you'' doing here?!
'''Bob:''' My old friend André told me you'd be okay making a few small changes in the script so that his daughter could be part of the film.
'''Marinette:''' But it's impossible, we've prepped and gotten everything set!
'''Bob:''' Moviemaking, kid, is the art of compromise. To protect your—I mean, the interest of the film, you gotta be flexible, therefore, André's daughter will play the starring role.
'''Marinette:''' That's not in the best interests of the film! ''Zoé'' is perfect for the role of the superhero of creation.
'''Chloé:''' The next plane for New York leaves in 30 minutes. ''(Marinette growls.)''
'''Zoé:''' ''(puts a hand on Marinette's shoulder)'' Marinette, no big deal if I don't play the main role. There is lots of other positions of the non-act crew.
'''Chloé:''' Perfect, as long as she's not on-screen, it's fine with me.
'''Bob:''' Then it's a deal! See you all tomorrow morning on set.
'''Chloé:''' Bye-bye, losers!
'''Bob:''' ''(shoving them out)'' Now get out! ''(He closes the door.)''
'''Marinette:''' This is totally unfair! ''(Zoé looks down sadly.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Jardin des Tuileries]]. Movie van.}}
<poem>
'''André:''' Believe this or not, I also shot a film in my youth. It was called ''"[[Solitude]]"''.
'''Chloé:''' Daddy, I'm trying to concentrate here!
'''André:''' Of course, sorry, sweetheart.
'''Chloé:''' And ''you'', Dupain-Cheng, cool it with the horrible costume, it's worse than (lame). ''(Sabrina laughs.)''
'''Marinette:''' That's why it suits you so well, Chloé. ''(Sabrina laughs again. Chloé glares at her, and she offers a banana.)
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Jardin des Tuileries. Outside the van.}}
<poem>
'''Nino:''' In this scene, the entire population has been put into an enchanted sleep, so we need tons of extras. ''(Marinette runs over to the rest.)'' You guys are gonna lay down here. ''(They lie down on the floor.)'' Perfect!
'''Chloé:''' Hey! All of you! Someone just told me I'm supposed to play the role of the supervillain of destruction and Mylène is the superhero of creation. Are you kidding me?! I get the lead role, I am the good guy, okay?
'''Nino:''' Chloé, those two roles are equally as impor—
'''Chloé:''' Blah, blah, blah, I don't care. I get to be the good guy.
'''Marinette:''' We don't have time for all of these changes, Chloé!
'''Chloé:''' Oh yeah? '''DADDY!''' ''(André giggles nervously. Nino rewrites the script.)''
'''Thomas:''' You know, it's not uncommon to have to adapt the script on the set at the last minute for production reasons. It's called—
'''Marinette:''' That's baloney, a waste of time, giving up on your dreams?
'''Thomas:''' ...a revision.
'''Nino:''' If it's for the good of the film... ''(Now from behind the camera.)'' Scene 9, take one. ''(Zoé snaps the clapperboard.)'' Action! ''(The students wait on the floor, but nothing happens. Nino looks around.)'' Chloé, you're supposed to be acting!
'''Chloé:''' ''(throwing the pages of the script)'' Lame! Boring! Dull! ''(Sabrina offers a banana.)'' What we need is a superhero film featuring a ''real'' superhero. Hey! ''(A Queen Bee silhouette appears in the background.)'' What's black and yellow, has pretty blonde hair, ''(she points at her ponytail)'' gets everyone's attention and is gonna break the box office?
'''Marinette:''' You're not talking about you as Queen Bee? 'Cause most of the time you were a super-disaster more than a superhero.
'''Chloé:''' Uh, actually, I wasn't even thinking of Queen Bee. I was thinking of a much more original character: Queen... uh... ''(Shows her banana)'' Queen Banana! ''(A Queen Banana silhouette appears instead of the Queen Bee one. [[Alix Kubdel|Alix]] laughs.)''
'''Marinette:''' Queen what?
'''Chloé:''' '''DADDY!''' ''(He laughs nervously again. Nino rewrites the script.)''
'''Nino:''' Scene 9, take 2. (Zoé snaps the clapperboard.) Action!
'''Chloé:''' Ah, this is ''way'' better than that ridiculous costume Dupain-Cheng made, but it's still missing something. I know, I need wheels! ''(A banana-themed car is shown.)''
'''Marinette:''' You don't need a car, these superheroes can ''fly''.
'''Chloé:''' What do ''you'' know about superheroes, baker girl? Just go back to sleep while I— '''DADDY!'''(Nino rewrites the script.)
'''Nino:''' Scene 9, take 3. (Zoé snaps the clapperboard.) Action!
'''Chloé:''' Ha! We can start now. ''(The crew behind the scenes sighs with relief.)'' Except, when she sees you all just lying around doing nothing, Queen Banana doesn't feel like saving you, she feels more like tossing you in the garbage.
'''Nino:''' Chloé, we're not changing everything again!
'''Chloé:''' Who said change everything? We just need a bigger and better challenge for Queen Banana! '''DADDY!''' ''(He sighs. Marinette helps Adrien into a cage and closes the door.)
'''Marinette:''' Thanks, Adrien. It's really gorgeous of you—I mean, generous of you—to come help us.
'''Adrien:''' Happy to, Marinette. My [[Gabriel Agreste|father]] said it was for the good of the film. ''(Marinette nods and raises her hand, and the cage gets lifted by a helicopter.)
'''Chloé:''' At least ''he'' is worth saving.
'''Nino:''' ''(with annoyance)'' Okay, now can we shoot?
'''Chloé:''' Hm, we need a new bad guy: a super-duper-ubervillain! ''(Nino bangs his head against the camera. He looks at the script with a pen in his mouth while everyone around him helps thinking.)
'''[[Max Kanté|Max]]:''' A galactic emperor?
'''Rose:''' A giant octopus that comes from outer space?
'''Alya:''' A fire breathing dragon?
'''Chloé:''' No, no, those are so lame! I want a giant yellow gorilla that throws exploding bananas.
'''Nino:''' ''(Zoé facepalms)''(shrugs)'' It's for the good of the film.
'''Chloé:''' ''(sees the cardboard gorilla)'' Are you kidding? I want a ''real'', dynamite-slinging gorilla, not some cardboard monkey!
'''Marinette:''' But Chloé, giant yellow dynamite-slinging apes do not exist!
'''Chloé:''' There are tons of giant gorillas doing stuff in ''all'' the good movies, can't you just hire one of those? Ugh, I'm so tired of all of you! ''(She walks away, followed by Sabrina.)'' I'm getting some beauty rest at the Palace, tomorrow you'd better have this monkey business figured out. ''(She slams the door of her limousine, which drives off. Sabrina runs after it.)''
'''[[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]]:''' Maybe the zoo will lend us an ape if we take extra good care of it.
'''Marinette:''' You're not really gonna look for a giant dynamite-flinging gorilla?
'''Max:''' It's for the good of the film, Marinette.
'''Marinette:''' It's not for the good of the film, it's not even a film anymore, it's just Chloé's fantasy! The only thing we're gonna do right now is get Adrien out of that cage. ''(Gets onto the banana-themed car.)'' Then we're gonna shoot the story that we all thought of together. ''That's'' for the good of the film! ''(Everyone cheers.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: A day passes. Next morning at the Jardin des Tuileries, Chloé's limousine arrives. Chloé exits limousine with Sabrina.}}
<poem>
'''Chloé:''' ''(looks around and gasps)'' Where's my giant gorilla? Where are all the others? ''(To a man loading boxes)'' Why isn't anyone here to shoot my big scene?
'''Man:''' They shot everything last night. Right about now they're probably over at the movie theater screening it.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The limousine makes it at full speed to the [[Sorbonne|movie theater]]. Inside.}}
<poem>
'''Chloé:''' ''(swinging the door open)'' What's that?! ''(She sees there's a movie playing.)''
'''Mylène (Destroika):''' Ultimate Nightmare! ''(Prepares her sword.)''
'''Zoé (Kreatika):''' Harmonic Wind!
''(They fight using the swords. The audience looks, amazed. Zoé/Kreatika uses her power to stop Mylène/Destroika, then to wake up the class/citizens.)''
'''Zoé (Kreatika):''' ''(taking her mask off)'' I've freed you from evil!
'''Mylène (Destroika):''' ''(removing her mask)'' Why did you wake them, Kreatika? Humans have destroyed the planet! They don't deserve to be awake! ''(Prepares her sword.)''
'''Zoé (Kreatika):''' ''(defending herself with her own sword)'' You're wrong, Destroika. Each one of those humans carries the hope of a better world within them!
'''Mylène (Destroika):''' You're just like them, I hate you! ''(Falls to try floor.)''
'''Zoé (Kreatika):''' You may hate me, but I love you, ''(kneels)'' and I always will, even if the whole world hates you, ''(places hand on Mylène/Destroika's)'' sister.
''(Mylène/Destroika looks up, and the two hug each other as the class/citizens cheer. The audience applauds.)''
'''Chloé:''' ''(Furious)'' This is ridiculous! Who authorized shooting this without me? Where's my monkey? And what is my half-of-a-sister doing in ''my'' movie?!
''(Adrien walks over to Chloé with tablet in his hands, with his father on the screen, with Marinette following behind.)''
'''Gabriel:''' ''(from tablet)'' Miss Dupain-Cheng convinced me to watch this first scene. I found it very moving and... Adrien is exceptional in it. I've therefore decided to privately finance the movie based on the original screenplay.
'''Chloé:''' DADDY!
'''Bob Roth:''' ''(counting money in his briefcase)'' Like we said before, kid: ''(shaking some of it in front of her)'' movie making's all about compromise. ''(puts money into briefcase and shuts it)''
'''Marinette:''' Sorry, Chloé. It was for the good of the film.
'''Chloé:''' ''(angrily, shoving away the banana Sabrina offers)'' Ridiculous! ''(slams the door open)'' Utterly ridiculous!

'''Gabriel:''' ''(watching Chloé furiously leaving the theatre from his tablet)'' But most of all, it's for the good of my plan. Chloé is always an excellent source of inspiration.

{{Scene|Scene: Chloé heads to the exit of the movie theater with a very mad expression on her face. Adrien runs after her.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' Hey, wait!
'''Chloé:''' ''(turns around)'' Adrikins, it's sweet of you to want to console me, but I'm fine. I'm going to get my revenge and send Zoé back to New York.
'''Adrien:''' Actually, I came to suggest that you apologize to everyone.
'''Chloé:''' ''(vehemently)'' Are you ill?! They've ruined my film!
'''Adrien:''' It was never your film, Chloé. It belonged to the group. You promised me you'd make an effort to stop being mean to everyone. I warned you that if you didn't, then we can no longer be friends.
'''Chloé:''' ''(ends her friendship with Adrien)'' You're as ridiculous that film! It's over, you're no longer my Adrikins, you're Adrinothing! ''(Runs off to the limousine and cries inside. The [[Akuma|akuma]] and the [[Amok|amok]] land in a pin on her hat.)''
'''Shadow Moth:''' ''(from his lair)'' Queen Banana, I am Shadow Moth. Once again, they refuse to recognize your true talent, so I give you the power to show them who the real star of [[Paris]] is.
'''Chloé:''' Fine, but I want a giant monkey who throws exploding bananas.
'''Shadow Moth:''' ''(from his lair)'' It's all arranged. I am the director of your dreams. In exchange for your powers- 
''(Chloé interrupts Shadow Moth, right when he was about to ask her in exchange of Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.)''
'''Chloé:''' Yeah, yeah, I know, [[Ladybug Miraculous|Ladybug]] and [[Cat Miraculous|Cat Noir]]'s [[Miraculouses|Miraculous]]. You'll have them!
''(Smiling evilly, Chloé transforms into Queen Banana along with her car, and a large and muscular [[Sentimonster|sentimonster]] banana-themed gorilla, [[Banana Boom-Boom]], appears. She blasts people with her banana gun and drives her car to Banana Boom-Boom's head.)''
'''Queen Banana:''' Banana Boom-Boom, action! ''(The Sentimonster roars and starts destroying the movie theater. Adrien looks down and walks away, very upset with Chloé no longer his friend. Suddenly, he falls after the destruction.)'' Where is my useless half-of-a-sister? Banana Boom-Boom, (peal) them off!
''(The sentimonster hits people, turning them into bananas. Adrien and Marinette with Zoé run away.)''

<poem>
'''Zoé:''' She's mainly mad at me, so I should try and reason with her.
'''Marinette:''' Unfortunately, no one can reason with your sister, Zoé. Stay here, I'm gonna... try to find a way out. ''(She runs up and sees Queen Banana wreaking havoc.)''
<div><center>'''''[Transformation Sequence]'''''<br />'''Marinette:''' Tikki, spots on! Yeah! ''(Marinette transforms into Ladybug.)''</center></div>
'''Queen Banana:''' ''(blasting at more people)'' If you don't come out from your hiding place, Zoé, I'm gonna turn all of Paris into bananas, and it'll be all your fault!
'''Zoé:''' My fault... ''(She looks at an emergency exit.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Rooftops of Paris. Cat Noir appears, much to Queen Banana and Banana Boom-Boom's surprise.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' Hey there, banana queen! So what's your superpower? Making people slip on banana peels?
'''Queen Banana:''' You're about to find out, ''(starts blasting)'' you ridiculous alley cat!
''(Cat Noir runs as Queen Banana and Banana Boom-Boom attack. He uses his [[Staff|staff]] to deflect the blasts. Ladybug grabs him with her [[yo-yo]], saving him from another one. They jump down.)''
'''Ladybug:''' Careful! Shadow Moth has been very generous to Chloé.
'''Cat Noir:''' I gotta admit, I'm a little jealous of her gear.
'''Ladybug:''' ''(extracts an ear communicator from her yo-yo)'' Totally unnecessary, nothing can beat a Cat and Ladybug duo.
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(extracts ear communicator from his staff)'' Meow, we do make the perfect pair, m'lady. ''(They take off to face Queen Banana. They try to attack her, but she fights back with bananas.)''
'''Ladybug:''' Well, we've got gear, too. [[Lucky Charm]]! ''(She gets a scooter, which she dodges skit doesn't land on her she checks it.)'' Scooter, helmets, tube of glue, cartridges, air pipe... Everything needed to fix a flat tire. That's a lot to process. ''(She looks around and forms a plan using the glue and the banana gun.)'' Still, something is missing, but what?
'''Zoé:''' Hey, Chloé! ''(Queen Banana looks down and sees Zoé standing in front.)'' Here I am!
'''Ladybug:''' Of course: Zoé! ''(She puts on a helmet.)''
'''Queen Banana:''' Ready for a transatlantic voyage on the banana express?
'''Zoé:''' Only if you promise to stop doing evil in Paris.
'''Queen Banana:''' ''(sarcastically)'' Of course, I promise I'll be really good. ''(She blasts a passerby.)''
'''Zoé:''' ''(angry)'' You'll never keep your promise!
'''Queen Banana:''' ''(cackles)'' Of course not, banana head! Banana Boom-Boom, grab her! ''(Ladybug grabs Zoé on board the scooter, and they drive away from Banana Boom-Boom.)''
'''Ladybug:''' Cat Noir, cover us!
'''Cat Noir:''' [[Cataclysm]]! ''(Queen Banana drives off the sentimonster, which goes haywire when hit by the cataclysm. As a result, a sentimonster goes berserk and roars crazily. Ladybug facepalms.)'' Oops. ''(Banana Boom-Boom attacks him and the surroundings.)'' 
'''Queen Banana:''' ''(cackles)'' When he's out of control, Banana Boom-Boom is even more destructive! Have fun, you two! ''(She flies off in the car.)''
'''Ladybug:''' Hang on tight. ''(She and Zoé drive to the metro, closely followed by Queen Banana, but end up alone because she gets stuck since her car is so big.)''
'''Queen Banana:''' You'll have to come out sometime, Ladybug, especially if you don't wanna see my monkey make a banana smoothie out of your kitty! ''(Cackles.)''

'''Ladybug:''' ''(taking her helmet off)'' We don't have much time. I need your help to save Cat Noir and Chloé. ''(She reaches the [[Bee Miraculous]] out of her yo-yo.)''
'''Zoé:''' Me, help you?
'''Ladybug:''' Zoé Lee, here is the Bee Miraculous, which grants you the power to immobilize your opponent. ''(She takes it with uncertainty.)'' You will use it for the greater good. ''([[Pollen]] flies out.)''
'''Pollen:''' At your service, my queen.
'''Zoé:''' ''(fearing)'' But Chloé's gonna furious, she used to be Queen Bee!
'''Ladybug:''' Chloé will never know it's you. Unlike her, ''(places a finger to her lips)'' you'll keep your identity a secret. And once the job is complete, you will return the Miraculous to me.
'''Zoé:''' I can't do it, I'm not strong enough, I—
'''Ladybug:''' ''(places hand on Zoé's shoulder)'' I know you can do this.
'''Pollen:''' You have only one thing to say, my queen: "Pollen, buzz on". ''(Zoé puts the Miraculous on)''

''(Banana Boom-Boom throws Cat Noir away and starts shooting bananas at Vesperia, who dodges them. She ends up running up his arm and using the Venom on his head. She lands next to Cat Noir.)''
'''Cat Noir:''' Queen Bee?
'''Vesperia:''' No, my name's Vesperia!
'''Cat Noir:''' Wow. ''(His ring starts flashing.)''
'''Vesperia:''' Ladybug's gonna need us again.
'''Cat Noir:''' Thrilled to make your acquaintance, Vesperia. ''(He kisses her hand, to Vesperia's surprise.)'' Just give me a second. 
''(They run to opposite sides of the Ferris wheel and de-transform. As Adrien gives camembert to Plagg, the latter starts regarding Zoé for her potential.)''

'''Vesperia:''' ''(lands with her Venom activated)'' Queen Banana, you're not even capable of a fair fight with the new holder of the Bee Miraculous!
'''Queen Banana:''' How dare you—I'm the one and only Queen Bee!
'''Vesperia:''' Oh, you were, but I am the real Queen Bee now. ''(Ladybug discretely puts glue where Queen Bananas stores the banana gun.)'' And you're only the queen of bananas! Ladybug chose me to defend Paris because you couldn't do it. ''(Queen Banana, furious, blasts Vesperia, turning her into a banana and freeing Ladybug in the meantime.)''
'''Queen Banana:''' ''(cackles)'' And what are you going to defend now that you're a banana? ''(She puts her banana gun away. To Ladybug and Cat Noir.)'' Now see what happens to people who don't see things my way? Give me your Miraculous! ''(She tries to pull out the banana gun, but it's stuck.)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(showing the tube of glue)'' This Lucky Charm glue is really good. And so is Vesperia, don't you think, Cat Noir?
'''Cat Noir:''' You counted your bananas before they were peeled, Queen Banana.
'''Queen Banana:''' No, not again!
''(Ladybug makes her trip with her yo-yo. Cat Noir uses his staff to toss the pin to Ladybug, who smashes it on the floor. The akuma and amok fly out.)''
'''Ladybug:''' No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize! ''(She catches them with her yo-yo.)'' Gotcha! ''(Opening the yo-yo.)'' Bye-bye, little butterfly. Bye, little feather. ''(Throws the box which came with the scooter up.)'' Miraculous Ladybug! ''(The damage is repaired.)''
'''Ladybug & Cat Noir:''' Pound it!
''(Although they've succeeded, but Chloé is still very mad at the heroes, back at what happened in [[Miracle Queen (The Battle of the Miraculous - Part 2)|the Season 3 Finale]].)''
'''Chloé:''' I hate you, Ladybug! And you, Vesperia. You're only a fake version of Queen Bee.
'''Ladybug:''' You need to learn to control your anger, Chloé. ''(She creates a [[Magical Charms|Magical Charm]].)'' There is a way I can help you, if you want.
'''Chloé:''' I don't want anything from you! You're non-existent to me, you're Lady-nothing-at-all! ''(She storms off.)''

'''Chloé:''' '''''DADDY!'''''
'''André:''' ''(confidently and sternly)'' Zoé is right, Chloé. You can ask me for a new cellphone or to paint the limousine pink, but you can't ask me to hurt your sister.
'''Chloé:''' ''(shaking with anger)'' Don't call her that. She's not even half of a sister, she's nothing to me! I— ''(turns to Zoé)'' I hate you!
'''Zoé:''' ''(places hands on Chloé's shoulders)'' You may hate me, but I love you, and I always will, even if the whole world hates you, sister. ''(she hugs Chloé)'' Remember? We have the same mother! Look, she even gave me this gift. ''(reaches out the Magical Charm)''
'''Chloé:''' If it comes from mom, then ''I'm'' the one who gets to wear it. Give it to me! ''(the akuma flies into the building)''

''(Chloé puts the Charm on as a necklace, and the akuma is blocked by a pink forcefield.)''
'''Marinette:''' It works!
