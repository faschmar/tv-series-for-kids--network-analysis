</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Getting ice cream from André's}}
<poem>
'''André:''' Which flavors for these two? [Kagami and Adrien] Orange and peppermint, a perfect pairing that's always a success; nothing can turn it into a mess. And for you two [Adrien and Marinette] blackberry and peppermint, an explosive mix that's a fact but often times it's the opposites that attract. Orange and blackberry, quite unusual it's true not the most obvious but it works for you two. So what will it be? 
'''Kagami:''' You pick. I don't really get what he's saying anyway.
'''Adrien:''' Yeah, you pick, Marinette. We trust you.
'''Marinette:''' Can't you find a blend for the three of us? 
'''André:''' I can, but too many flavors mixed together may throw off the delicate balance.
'''Marinette:''' I don't know. Blackberry and peppermint doesn't seem like a great pair. And what if the mint finds the blackberry lame and wants to be with the orange instead? And it's true that orange and peppermint are awesome together and well orange and blackberry just doesn't seem like they go together. (''looks at Kagami and Adrien together, walks up to André'') Look I think your first idea was the best. The orange and peppermint ice cream for.. for my friends here.
'''André''' (''concerned'') Are you sure Marinette? (''she nods, Adrien approaches cart'')
'''Marinette''' (''walks away and speaks to Kagami'') I'm gonna head back to the palace. I told my parents I'd bring them back those cocktail umbrellas. 
'''Kagami:''' We'll go with you. 
'''Marinette:''' No no, don't bother. Enjoy your ice cream. (''quickly looks back before leaving'') Seriously.
'''Adrien:''' (''gets ice cream from André and and asks Kagami'') Where's Marinette?

'''Audrey Heart Hunter:''' And for dessert, the cat! I'm sure he's very tasty. (''Continues pursuing Ladybug'')
'''Hawk Moth:''' It's always the same. Whenever she's backed up against a wall, Ladybug engages others to fight by her side. I'm convinced that the Guardian of the Miraculous is who she seeks every time.
'''Ladybug:''' (''Continues dodging attacks, looking around'') Where are you Cat Noir?
</poem>

</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Goes to Master Fu but forgets to detransform.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug:''' Master Fu, I need your help! 
'''Master Fu:''' (''sees Ladybug, gasps'') This costume is very cute, miss, but is it really fitting in this place?
'''Ladybug:''' (''gasps'') I forgot to transform back. (''Looks arounds enters the center of the merry-go-round trying to remain unseen'') I haven't been followed Master, I'm sure of it.
'''Master Fu:''' Hmm, (''decides to open the box'') Ladybug, if you'd like to have a turn on the merry-go-round, please pick your favorite horse. Once the mission is over you will retrieve the Miraculous and return it back to me.

</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Ladybug takes Kagami away while Kagami and Adrien were finishing the ice cream.}}
<poem>
'''Kagami:''' I'm honored that you've chosen me Ladybug, but I thought you couldn't give me this Miraculous again since Hawk Moth knows my identity.
'''Ladybug:''' There's no time. I need (''contemplating what to say'') your exceptional talent.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien runs into a back alley to transform.}}
'''Adrien:''' [[Plagg]], Claws out!
{{Scene|Scene: Ladybug and Ryuko talk about Adrien}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug:''' (''Miraculous beeps rapidly'') Don't look at me. I have to transform back. My kwami needs to refuel. (''runs behind a wall'') Spots off! (''detransforms'') 
'''Marinette: ('''''hands Tikki a macaron'') I hope I didn't interrupt anything with... that boy. (''places Dragon Miraculous on the ground'') 
'''Kagami:''' (''walks over and picks it up'') You did turn up a little... unexpectedly. (''opens box'') 
'''[[Longg]]:''' I'm honored to see you again, Kagami-San. We're about to accomplish great things together!
'''Kagami:''' Honor is mine, Longg-Sama.
'''Marinette:''' The boy's famous, isn't he? You're bound to break a lot of hearts.
'''Kagami:''' There's only one person I don't want to hurt. Marinette. She's the only other friend I have. But Adrien and I are made for each other. We're so alike, (''puts on Dragon choker'') I can't give him up, even for the sake of friendship.
'''Marinette:''' Sometimes choices can be so hard.
'''Kagami:''' We have a mission to do. Longg, bring the storm! (''Longg goes into the choker'')
'''Marinette:''' Tikki, spots on! (''Tikki goes into the earrings'')
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Place des Vosges}}
<poem>
'''Hawk Moth:''' You're powerless against me, old man. And Ladybug isn't here to protect you. Tell me the secret identities of Ladybug and Cat Noir.
'''Master Fu:''' Never!
'''Hawk Moth:''' Then help me get their Miraculous and I won't harm you.
'''Master Fu:''' You're not getting anything from me! [[Wayzz]]-
'''Wayzz:''' It's too dangerous, Master! You're too old for this...
'''Master Fu:''' Shell on! (''transforms into Jade Turtle'')
'''Hawk Moth:''' Very impressive.
'''Jade Turtle:''' Shell-ter!
'''Hawk Moth:''' You're on borrowed time, you crazy old man. I'll just wait for you to transform back.
'''Jade Turtle:''' My powers are no more time sensitive than yours. Obviously you haven't learned anything about the Miraculous, Hawk Moth.
'''Hawk Moth:''' I've learned enough to defeat you. The end of superheroes has come!
'''Jade Turtle:''' You talk a lot, but you haven't achieved much so far.
'''Hawk Moth:''' (''getting frustrated'') Your defeat will be my greatest achievement!

'''Ladybug:''' (''Ladybug hops on a building with Ryuko'') 
'''Chloé:''' (''notices Ladybug, gasps and smiles, sees both Ladybug and Ryuko leave, gets upset'') What about me?! You were supposed to give me a Miraculous! This is ridiculous, utterly ridiculous! They're my parents, you know. So I should be the one to save them!

<poem>
'''Chloé:''' (''growls angrily and throws her bee signal off the roof, lowers her head and sulks'')
'''Hawk Moth:''' Chloé Bourgeois, rejections hurt! (''Chloé turns to face him'') Your talents deserve to be recognized! Ladybug and Cat Noir's reign has gone on long enough. It's time for Paris to have a new queen, and the Queen Bee on my chessboard is you.
'''Chloé:''' You've akumatized my parents! If I had my Miraculous I'd-
'''Hawk Moth:''' (''puts up his hand and interrupts'') You're right, but I did it for one reason only. So that you would finally realize that Ladybug will never give you the Bee Miraculous again. I, however, always keep my promises. (''shows her the Bee Miraculous in his hand'')
'''Chloé:''' This isn't real! How do you have it? 
'''Hawk Moth:''' Try it and see for yourself. You're Ladybug's greatest fan. You've helped her, you've trusted her, and what has she done for you in return? 
'''Chloé:''' (''gets angry'') Nothing! She couldn't care less about me! I'm done with her. She's irrelevant, utterly irrelevant! (''reaches out to grap the Miraculous, stops'') I want you to deakumatize has my parents first! 
'''Hawk Moth:''' Whatever you say, my queen. (''Chloé takes the comb and puts it in her hair, releasing Pollen'')
