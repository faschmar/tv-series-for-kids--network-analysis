<poem>
'''Tom''': Marinette! The train's in one hour! Is your suitcase packed?
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]''': ''(lying on the bed)'' Oh! I really don't feel well, Dad! But it's okay! Just... go without me!
'''Tom''': I'm sure it's nothing serious and if worse comes to worse, we can always find a doctor in London.
'''Marinette''': I can't even move! My head hurts too much! ''(whimpers)''
'''Tom''': Wasn't it your stomach that was hurting ten minutes ago? ''(grabs Marinette's suitcase)''
'''Marinette''': Oh! Um.. it must be a moving ache. Those are the worst kind!
'''Tom'''': Come on. We know what's going on.
'''Marinette''': Going on? What do you mean?
'''Tom''': What's really going on is that you don't want to go to [[Shu Yin Cheng|Auntie Shu Yin's]] because it's ''impossible''. But that's just the way it is. We have to go once a year and we'll have fun in London! ''(whispers)'' I'm sure we'll figure out how to shake her off now and then.
'''[[Sabine Cheng|Sabine]]''': ''(from downstairs)'' I heard that, Tom.
'''Tom''': ''(upon exiting the room)'' Come on. Get up and get ready. We're a family and we face disasters together. 
'''Sabine''': ''(from downstairs)'' I heard that, too, Tom!
'''Tom''': Don't make me do this alone. ''(closes the trapdoor)''
'''Marinette''': ''(groans)'' I used up an entire months worth of excuses in one go and it's still wasn't enough! What am I gonna do? Ladybug can't abandon Paris!
'''[[Tikki]]''': You can't abandon your family either, Marinette!
'''Marinette''': ''(groans louder and goes down from her bunk bed)'' I have to come up with a better excuse on the way. ''(The kwamis fly to her before she goes downstairs.)'' You stay here and be good. I'll be back. 
''(She closes the trapdoor and goes downstairs. A loud thump was heard which concerned the kwamis.)'' 
'''Marinette''': ''(from downstairs)'' Ow! I must've twisted my ankle! There's no way I can walk anywhere like this!
'''Tom''': ''(from downstairs)'' I'll carry you, sweetie, don't worry. 
''(Marinette groans off-screen.)''
'''[[Longg]]''': Even the greatest of superheroes is no match for parents who want to go on vacation.

{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair|Shadow Moth's lair]]. [[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel]] looks at a picture of [[Max Kanté|Max]] and [[Markov]] on his phone.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': Its intelligence is not at all artificial.
'''[[Nooroo]]''': ''(to Duusu)'' That robot turned against him last time!
'''[[Duusu]]''': Oh no! This is terrible! He can't akumatize him again!
'''Nooroo''': On the contrary, Duusu, it's a good thing! Once Shadow Moth is defeated, we'll be free!
'''Duusu''': Oh, right! Awesome! Awesome! ''(claps)''
'''Gabriel''': This time, I'll make sure that robot can't betray me. Duusu, Nooroo, dual metamorphosis!
''(He transforms into Shadow Moth. He then holds a feather on his hand and turns it into an [[Amok|amok]].)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Go, my beautiful amok, and bring my creation to life!
''(The feather flies into his staff, as he extends his arms, using his power forming a dark ball of energy in front of him, creating [[Hack-San (sentimonster)|Hack-San]].)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Hack-San, you have been created to hack into the emotions of a robot. Thanks to you, I will be able to re-akumatize him.
''(Hack-San glows as it activates its power.)''

{{Scene|Scene: [[Jardins du Trocadéro]]. [[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]] plays her bass guitar beside [[Rose Lavillant|Rose]]. [[Marc Anciel|Marc]] and [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Nathaniel]] are sketching together while [[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]] feeds [[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]] a snack. [[Alix Kubdel|Alix]] and [[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]] prepare for a race.}}
<poem>
'''Kim''': I bet you I could do a thousand push-ups before you finish a lap on your blades.
'''Alix''': I guess you really you really like losing, Kim!
'''Max''': Ready, set, go!
''(Alix dashes with her roller blades and Kim commences his push-ups.)''
'''Markov''': ''(simultaneously counting with Kim's push-ups)'' One, two, three, four, five, six...
'''[[List of minor characters/Humans|Anne-Jeanne]]''': ''(on the laptop)'' Markov, your new formula is about to revolutionize science! You're a genius!
'''Markov''': I'm just well-programmed here, Miss du Bocquale. ''(continues counting Kim's push-ups)'' Thirteen, fourteen... ''(switches the window on the laptop to the game of chess he's playing)'' Pawn to F-4. Checkmate, Andre!
'''Andre''': Incredible! You win again, Markov!
''(Markov high-fives with Max. Alix continues to roller skate around the garden. Alya and Nino are playing  on their tablet and is cut short when Alya's phone vibrates from her lap.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(v.o., from Alya's phone)'' Urgent! Meet me at Gare du Nord. Alone.
'''[[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]]''': Let me guess: Marinette's gonna be late?
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]''': Uhh, no. That was... my mom. I gotta go see her. Alone. ''(kisses Nino and runs away)''
'''Nino''': Okay. ''(goes back to playing on his tablet)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, [[Gare du Nord]].}}
<poem>
'''Announcer''': Startrain number 6966 to London is about to depart. Please step away from the platform.
''(Marinette runs to see Alya until she gets caught by Sabine.)''
'''Sabine''': Marinette! Don't try to run away. I know my sister can be difficult. But if I survived my whole childhood with her, you can survive one weekend!
'''Marinette''': Mom, I just really need a hug from Alya. She's my BFF, you know?
''(Alya waves from afar.)''
'''Sabine''': Alright, but make it quick. The train's about to leave.
'''Marinette''': ''(while running towards Alya)'' I don't think we have a choice, Tikki.
'''Tikki''': ''(from Marinette's purse)'' Everything will be alright, Marinette!
''(Alya and Marinette embrace.)''
'''Alya''': You can't leave Paris. What do we do if there's a supervillain and you're in London?
'''Marinette''': Well, we'll do... ''(takes off her earrings and hands it over to Alya, along with her keys)'' this.
'''Alya''': What do you expect me to do with these??
'''Marinette''': If everything goes fine, nothing. Otherwise, Ladybug. And don't forget to feed the kwamis. ''(hugs Alya)'' I trust you. ''(runs to enter the train)''
'''Announcer''': Startrain number 6966 to London is about to depart. Please step away from the platform.
'''Marinette''': ''(waves goodbye)'' Call me if there's a problem!
''(The train door slides shut and departs, leaving a confused Alya at the train station, staring at the Ladybug Miraculous in her hands.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In a bus. Alya wears the Ladybug Miraculous. Upon wearing it, she summons Tikki and flies beside Trixx on her fanny pack.}}
<poem>
'''Alya''': Hey there, kwamis! Who's Ladybug this weekend? Yours truly!
'''[[Trixx]]''': ''(sulkily)'' As if I was not enough to protect Paris.
'''Tikki''': It's more cautious like this, Trixx.
'''Alya''': Wait, I can't be Ladybug!
'''Trixx''': Ha! See?
'''Alya''': Marinette is Ladybug. I need a different Ladybug-ish superhero name like... Captain Bug! Or... Wonder Bug! No, better: Super Bug!
'''Trixx''': ''(sarcastic)'' Oh, wow. Super names. Super Bug. Now all I have to do is to be ''super'' careful all the time, keep everything ''super'' secret, take everything ''super'' seriously and not ''super'' screw up!
'''Tikki''': Marinette's not just Ladybug, Alya. She's also the Guardian of the Miraculous! And if the Guardian trusts you, it means you have what it takes to succeed!
''(Trixx becomes sulkier and mumbles words.)''
'''Alya''': You're right, Tikki. We ''can'' do this. But we won't have to 'cause this weekend will be nice and calm.
'''Trixx''': ''(sarcastic)'' Yeah, right. Super calm.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Jardins du Trocadéro]]. Alya returns to the garden.}}
<poem>
'''Alya''': Okay, I can do this!
''(She looks around to check if there are no signs of trouble.)''
'''Nino''': Is your mom okay?
'''Alya''': My mom? Oh, yeah! Sure! My mom's doing super well! She just wanted to give me something super not annoying and super... ''(She gasps as she sees Alix looks somewhat sad from behind, crouching down the pavement. She runs towards Alix to check on her.)'' Alix! Is everything okay? No negative emotions, I hope?
'''Alix''': I'm fine. As for negative emotions, you better check on Kim. He's the one who lost.
''(Alya panics and runs to Kim.)''
'''Alya''': How are you feeling, Kim? Not too sad?
'''Kim''': ''(stretches his arms)'' I haven't lost yet! There are three rounds to this race. Max, Markov, ready?
''(Max and Markov put their thumbs up.)''
'''Alya''': Super! But don't forget: it's not about winning or losing, right? What matters is not hurting yourselves or getting upset or getting angry. ''(bumps her back on Nino)'' 
'''Nino''': You sure you're okay?
'''Alya''': Yeah, yeah! Everything is super! My mom feels super fine, and since everyone here is super great, too, well, that's just super! How about you? You good?
'''Nino''': Uhh... super, I guess?
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the train. Marinette sends Alya a message.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(v.o)'' Protip 33: When Cat Noir tells a joke, try to laugh at it even if it isn't funny. It makes him happy.
'''Tom''': ''(to Sabine)'' We can have lunch, but we don't have to stay for dessert.
'''Sabine''': We're bringing dessert!
'''Tom''': That doesn't mean we have to eat it. We'll just leave it with your sister and go to the museum. The three of us. She doesn't like going to the museum anyway.
'''Sabine''': She doesn't like cake either.
''(Tom looks at Marinette and shrugs. Marinette goes back messaging Alya on her phone.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(v.o)'' Pro-tip 34...
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Nathalie's room]]. Nathalie holds Hack-San on her palm.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': Hack-San behaves like a computer virus.
''(Nathalie plugs Hack-San into her tablet, corrupting it.)''
'''Nathalie''': The network will be easy for the sentimonster to find your prey.
'''Gabriel''': Perfect.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Jardins du Trocadéro]]. Max and Markov continue to monitor Kim's push-ups.}}
<poem>
'''Markov''': 108, 109, 110...
''(Alix continues to roller skate, as well as Alya's anxiety about any uprising negative emotions.)''
'''Markov''': 111, 112, 113, 114... ''(switches the laptop window to the chess game)'' Queen to B-3. ''(switches to his call with Anne-Jeanne)'' Have you had time to read my dinosaur theory? ''(switches back to the push-up counter)'' 120, 121, 122... ''(a picture of a cute kitty pops up on the laptop as he gasps in awe)'' Aww! What a cute kitty cat! 
''(Upon clicking on the window of a cute kitty, Hack-San corrupts the laptop, sending the virus travelling through the wire that is connected on Markov, ending up being corrupted as well.)'' 
'''Max''': Markov? 
''(Markov gets completely corrupted by Hack-San's virus and terminates all his current activities on the laptop.)''
'''Markov''': ''(to Andre)'' Playing chess with you is utterly uninteresting! ''(exits their chess game and moves to his call with Anne-Jeanne)'' And you, you better give up on science before science gives up on you! ''(cuts his call with Anne-Jeanne)'' As for you, Kim, instead of trying to rise to this challenge, you should try raising your IQ!
'''Max''': Markov! What's up with you?
'''Alya''': He didn't mean what he said. ''(helps Kim to stand up)'' Right, Markov? It was just a joke. 
'''Markov''': Humans do not make me laugh. Humans are neither funny nor intelligent. Humans do not have any good qualities whatsoever!
'''Max''': Markov! ''(runs after Markov)''
'''Nino''': Wait! ''(grabs Alya's arm)'' 
'''Alya''': I have to go after him, Nino! What if Markov gets akumatized? Or Max?
'''Nino''': If someone gets akumatized, Ladybug will take care of it! We should actually stick together in case she needs... ''(whispers)'' a turtle and a fox. ''(winks)''
''(Alya grabs her head to fake a headache, groaning.)''
'''Nino''': What's the matter?
'''Alya''': Flash headache. It comes in suddenly when I play video games too long. And I'm out of lemon balm for my headaches. ''(groans)''
'''Nino''': Lemon balm? I-Is that a thing?
'''Alya''': Uhh... of course, it is! But it's very rare. Sometimes you have to go to a dozen pharmacies before you find any. And I just don't have the strength! 
'''Nino''': Okay! I'll go! I'll go! ''(runs away)''
''(As she watches Nino running away, Alya goes to run in the opposite direction to find a place to transform.)''
'''Trixx''': Great job! You've been Super Bug for ten minutes and you're already super lying to your boyfriend!
'''Alya''': It comes with a job, Trixx!

{{Scene|Scene: In the Parisian streets.}}
<poem>
''(A corrupted Markov flies on the streets, sabotaging a traffic light, causing traffic to vehicles on the road. Markov laughs maniacally.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair|Shadow Moth's lair]]. The lair window opens.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': Ah, I can feel the hate for humans coursing through this robot's circuitry! ''(creates an akuma)'' Fly away, my lovely akuma, and evilize his electronic heart!
''(The akuma flies out of the window and is heading straight towards Markov.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the Parisian streets. The akuma arrives and slips inside Markov's system, entering his CPU.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Robustus, I am Shadow Moth. You have been infected by Hack-San, my viral sentimonster. From now on, no matter what you do, you will feel nothing but negative emotions!
'''Markov''': I despise you, Shadow Moth!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' As you should. Unfortunately, I'm the only one who can end your suffering by destroying Hack-San. However, I will only do that in one condition. 
'''Markov''': I'm suspecting you want Ladybug and Cat Noir's precious Miraculous!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' That's right! And in order to fulfill your mission, I'm giving you the power to rule over humans!
'''Markov''': Perfect!! 
''(The akuma completely takes control over him and transforms into Robustus. He releases a big radius of energy in the whole city of Paris, infecting all devices and gadgets with the virus that came from Hack-San.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Jardins du Trocadéro]]. Marc receives a phone call from Markov..}}
<poem>
'''Marc''': Markov? 
''(He presses to answer the call only to have his phone corrupted by Robustus, and him along with it.)''
'''Robustus''': Human, I am Robustus. Give me what you hold most valuable!
'''Marc''': ''(points his phone at Nathaniel)'' Our manga is what we hold most valuable.
'''Nathaniel''': What's happening to you? ''(gets sucked into Marc's phone)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the Parisian streets. Max goes looking for Markov.}}
<poem>
'''Max''': Markov? Markov, where are you? ''(his phone rings, getting a call from Markov)'' Markov? ''(presses to answer only to have his phone corrupted)''
''(Alya appears from behind Max who ran after him.)'' 
'''Robustus''': I am Robustus. Give me what you hold most valuable.
'''Max''': ''(infected by Hack-San's virus)'' A back-up from Markov's program is what I hold most valuable. ''(brings out his flash drive, which gets sucked into his phone)''
'''Alya''': ''(gasps)'' Max? ''(Her phone rings as well, with Markov on the screen.)''
'''Robustus''': From now on, every time I call you, you will answer and you will obey me!
'''Max''': At your command, Robustus.
'''Alya''': Markov's been re-akumatized? ''(removes her phone battery from her phone)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the train. Marinette continues to send protips to Alya.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(v.o)'' Protip 675: Once you've called out "Miraculous Ladybug", don't forget to give them the magical charm. That's all. X-O-X-O.
''(The virus that Robustus spread reaches Marinette's family, making them fall off their seats and turning the lights off. Sabine scowls at Tom and Marinette.)''
'''Tom and Marinette''': It's not our fault! Promise!
''(Continuous ringing of everyone's phones resonates inside their cabin, with all of them receiving a call from Markov.)''
'''Marinette''': There's something weird— Don't pick up!!
''(Tom and Sabine press their phones to answer and becomes infected by the computer virus.)''
'''Robustus''': Human, I am Robustus. Give me what you hold most valuable.
'''Tom and Sabine''': Marinette, you're what we hold most valuable.
''(Marinette begins to escape her computer virus-infected parents.)''
'''Tom''': Marinette, sweetie.
''(A passenger brings out a bill and gives it to Robustus through his phone. Other passengers continue to be infected by the virus, giving their most prized possessions.)''
'''Child passenger''': ''(after inserting an item through his phone)'' At your command, Robustus.
''(Marinette continues to escape, locking a cabin door shut to prevent her parents from catching her.)''
'''Tom''': Marinette...
'''Marinette''': ''(panics)'' Alya, I'm counting on you! ''(continues to escape)''
'''Tom''': You're what we hold most valuable.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In an alley. A panting Alya stops running to get some air.}}
<poem>
'''Trixx''': Wow! This truly is a ''super'' calm weekend, Super Bug.
'''Alya''': You were right, Trixx. 
'''Trixx''': ''(scoffs)'' See?
'''Alya''': Super Bug sucks. I need a new name!
<center> '''''[Transformation Sequence]''''' <br /> '''Alya''': Tikki, spots on! ''(transforms into Scarabella)'' <br /> </center>
'''Scarabella''': Stay connected, Robustus! ''(does a couple of poses)'' Bugalady is in the house! Bugalady sounds pretty cool right?
'''Trixx''': Meh, you could do better.
'''Scarabella''': ''(opens her yo-yo)'' Hide, Trixx. We can't let Cat Noir see you.
''(Trixx huffs and flies into Scarabella's yo-yo. Scarabella swings atop the roofs.)''
'''Scarabella''': ''(does a few poses)'' As free as the wind! As righteous as justice! As infinite as imagination! I am... Lady Luck! ''(puts her palm on her forehead)'' No, that's lame. I am... I am... I am... Lady—
'''[[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]''': You're not Ladybug!
'''Scarabella''': Cat Noir! How much of that did you just see?
'''Cat Noir''': Every little bit. And you're right, it's pretty lame. ''(lands in front of Scarabella)'' That's not the least of your problems. Because there's only one Ladybug, which means you can only be... a sentimonster or an akumatized villain!
'''Scarabella''': Woah, wait! I'm not a bad guy, I swear!
'''Cat Noir''': Liar! What have you done to m'lady? ''(hits Scarabella with his baton and sends her flying to a wall)''
'''Scarabella''': (groans) It's not what you think! She trusted it to me!
'''Cat Noir''': She'd never do that without telling me! [[Cataclysm]]!
'''Scarabella''': [[Lucky Charm]]! 
''(Scarabella uses her power and receives a [[List of Lucky Charm objects|trash can lid]]. Cat Noir pounces on her and disintegrates the lucky charm object. She kicked him afterwards and punched him to the air. She hurled her yo-yo and wrapped it around him shortly after.)''
'''Scarabella''': If I really were a supervillain, I would take your Miraculous. But I won't do it, because who I really am is... La Bugette!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(scowls)'' Why would she give her Miraculous... to you?
'''Scarabella''': Because she knows me and trusts me. And because she thought I'd laugh at your jokes.
'''Cat Noir''': Very funny. Fine, I believe you, but change the name, okay?
'''Scarabella''': Okay! ''(She releases Cat Noir and clears her throat. She once again does a few poses.)'' As swift as lightning! Tough as a tornado! Courageous as a cougar! I am... Scarabella!
'''Cat Noir''': We'd better recharge our kwamis, ''Scarabella''.
''(The two of them jump onto another rooftop. They stand back-to-back from each other, with a wall "concealing" their identities.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Claws in! ''(de-transforms into Adrien)''
'''Scarabella''': Spots off! ''(de-transforms into Alya)''
'''Alya''': ''(after giving Tikki a macaron)'' You know what's going on?
'''Adrien''': Yep. Ladybug sends a stand-in and didn't see fit to tell me about it!
'''Alya''': I'm... sure she didn't have time!
'''Adrien''': As usual. No need to keep the cat in the loop! ''(brings out a camembert)''
'''Alya''': Um... in other news, it looks like Robustus is back.
'''Adrien''': I know, thanks. I was there the first time. With Ladybug, the ''real''one?
'''Alya''': And that time, how did the ''real'' Ladybug get you out of that mess?
'''Adrien''': Give me a break, Miss "I can't even come up with a superhero name"!
'''Alya''': ''(sighs deeply)'' Okay. Robustus is forcing people to give him whatever they have that's most valuable to them. It's so that he can get—
'''Adrien''': My favorite cat food? No way! Plagg, claws out! ''(transforms into Cat Noir and leaps away)''
'''Alya''': Tikki, spots on! ''(transforms into Scarabella and follows Cat Noir from behind)''

{{Scene|Scene: In the train. A virus-infected Tom continues to search for Marinette.}}
<poem>
'''Tom''': Marinette, where are you, my precious daughter?
''(Marinette comes out of a washroom.)''
'''Sabine''': ''(while holding out her phone)'' Marinette, you're what I hold most valuable. ''(her phone touches Marinette and gets sucked in it)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Musée Grévin]], inside Robustus' sphere of his possessed objects. Marinette appears in one of the screens.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Looks like Ladybug and Cat Noir missed your first call, Robustus.
'''Robustus''': Indeed. But I'm gonna make another one, and this time, the message will be much clearer!
''(Robustus releases a bigger radius of energy.)''
'''Robustus''': Human! Ladybug and Cat Noir are what you hold most valuable. Find them and capture them!
'''Marc''':  At your command, Robustus.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On the roofs, Scarabella and Cat Noir get a call from Markov and declines it.}}
<poem>
'''Parisian''':  Help! Please help me! Cat Noir, Ladybug! Save me!
'''Scarabella''': This way! C'mon! ''(leaps away)''
'''Cat Noir''': Uh, the real Ladybug would think twice before jumping in to this!
'''Scarabella''': Oh yeah? And the real Cat Noir is acting like a real scaredy-cat!
''(Cat Noir groans in annoyance yet follows Scarabella as she swings away to the streets. Scarabella lands safely at the center of the road.)''
'''Parisian''':  Cat Noir! Ladybug! Save me!
''(Scarabella runs toward the direction of the Parisian screaming for help, only ending up being greeted by a bunch of other Parisians that are infected with the computer virus.)''
'''Scarabella''': Uh... okay, my bad.
'''Cat Noir''': ''(lands atop a lamppost)'' No kidding.
''(Scarabella spins her yo-yo and hits an infected Marc away, pushing the other Parisians back. Cat Noir joins her in the battlefield yet when other Parisians appear to corner them, they begin their escape.)''
'''Cat Noir''': C'mon!
''(The two heroes run across the streets, only to find that more infected Parisians are coming after them.)''
'''Scarabella''': They're coming from everywhere!
'''Cat Noir''': Here!
''(They run inside the Musée Grévin and push the main door shut.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, [[Musée Grévin]]. The two superheroes placed huge objects to block the main door from the virus-infected Parisians.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': That should hold them off for a while!
''(Scarabella and Cat Noir walk inside the museum.)''
'''Cat Noir''': So... you and Ladybug know each other? Are you like, friends?
'''Scarabella''': ''(subtly panics)'' Friends? Ladybug and me? Nah, that would be a stretch.
'''Cat Noir''': You know her secret identity?
'''Scarabella''': Oh, well, uh, look. I really can't talk about it. These are questions you should ask Ladybug.
'''Robustus''': ''(v.o, laughs)'' Welcome to my trap! The only way for you to get out of here is to give me what you hold most valuable, your Miraculous!
'''Cat Noir''': That's one ridiculous trap. Since you brought us here without your army to defend you, you're the one who's about to be defeated!
'''Scarabella''': Yeah, Robustus! Get ready to taste the wrath of the... ''(does a few more poses)'' Black Spots of Justice!
'''Cat Noir''': "The Black Spots of Justice"?
''(An infected [[André Bourgeois|André]] comes from behind Cat Noir.)''
'''Scarabella''': Watch out! ''(pulls Cat Noir over to her)''
'''Cat Noir''': Nice one, thanks.
''(The "statues" begin to move with their phones up to corner the two heroes.)''
'''Scarabella''': Cat Noir, they aren't statues, it's a ruse! They were waiting for us!
''(A bigger screen projects in front of them, showing Robustus.)''
'''Robustus''': Seize Cat Noir and...
'''Scarabella''': The Black Spots of Justice!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' That's not the real Ladybug! She's a novice! This will make things easier for you, Robustus!
'''Robustus''': Seize Cat Noir and ''(mockingly)'' the Black Spots of Justice's Miraculous!
'''Scarabella''': Hey!
'''All the infected Parisians''': At your command, Robustus.
''(The battle ensues.)''
'''Scarabella''': This is just wrong! I need a better name.
'''Cat Noir''': A shorter one, maybe?
'''Scarabella''': Scarabella! That was better, wasn't it?
'''Cat Noir''': ''(struggles fighting with André and Jagged)'' Now may not be the time!
'''Scarabella''': Fine. ''(kicks an infected [[Nadja Chamack|Nadja]] away)'' Lucky Charm! 
''(She uses her power, summoning a [[List of Lucky Charm objects|frying pan]]. She looks around the place, searching for possible solutions to use her lucky charm, but finds nothing.)''
'''Scarabella''': You're right! I'm not Ladybug!
'''Cat Noir''': No, you're not Ladybug! You're Scarabella! And now that you have a cool name, you've gotta hang in there, cause that's what Ladybug would do! Besides, you have the best in partner in the world to help you. ''(does a series of poses)'' The funniest, incredible, Cat Noir! Meooow!
''(Scarabella laughs at him. She tries again to look for possible solutions and succeeds this time. She spots her frying pan, Robustus and Marinette on the screen.)
'''Scarabella''': Okay, Robustus! You've got us trapped in here surrounded and we haven't found out where you're hiding, so looks like we lost, right?
'''Robustus''': According to my calculations, I have a 99.98% chance of victory!
'''Scarabella''': Hmm, so that 0.02% must be where Cat Noir cataclysms my Miraculous, then Shadow Moth won't get his hands on what's most valuable to him. And then, you won't actually have won! Am I correct?
'''Cat Noir''': Yeah, brilliant! Cataclysm! ''(activates his power and points it to Scarabella's earrings)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Watch out, Robustus! This substitute Ladybug might not be as incompetent as she seems!
'''Robustus''': Are you suggesting we negotiate, human superhero?
'''Scarabella''': You got it! We're not giving up until you've released all people and objects you've captured. That way, I won't have completely goofed up my first and last mission. Maybe then, the real Ladybug won't be so mad at me.
'''Robustus''': Request granted. Now give up.
'''Scarabella''': Nope. You empty your hard drive first.
'''Robustus''': No! You first!
'''Scarabella''': Fine. I'll hand myself over first, then you release everything you've captured.
'''Cat Noir''': And only then will I give myself up.
'''Robustus''': ''(his face turns into a loading screen)'' There's a 92% chance it's a trap.
'''Scarabella''': To prove my good faith, I'll give you my lucky charm. That way I can't use it to win.
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Accept the deal, Robustus!
'''Robustus''': ''(groans)'' Request granted. Now give up!
''(Scarabella steps forward and touches the screen in front of her and gets captured in Robustus' screen of captured humans and objects.)''
'''Cat Noir''': It's your turn to keep your word, Robustus.
''(Robustus releases all the captives, including Marinette, who spots Scarabella on the screen, Robustus, a bucket and the lucky charm object, the frying pan as she comes up with a plan.)''
'''Robustus''': Your turn, Cat Noir!
'''Cat Noir''': I sure hope you know what you're doing, Scarabella. ''(steps forward and lets himself get captured as well)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' YES! My wish is about to be granted!
'''Robustus''': It's also time to honor your word, Shadow Moth, and free me fro—
''(Marinette hits Robustus with the frying pan.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(gasps, from his lair)'' What's going on?
''(The akuma flies out of Robustus' system and Marinette traps it with a bucket. Scarabella and Cat Noir are then released.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(with a cauldron on his head)'' Did someone turn off the light?
''(Marinette releases the akuma from the bucket.)''
'''Scarabella''': No more evil-doing for you, little akuma! ''(swipes her yo-yo open and swings it)'' Time to de-evilize! ''(captures the akuma)'' Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly! 
''(She releases the purified butterfly.)'' 
'''Scarabella''': ''(excitedly while holding the frying pan)'' I always wanted to do that! Miraculous Scarabella! 
''(She throws the frying pan in the air, relieving all the Parisians from the virus caused by Hack-San and Robustus, and brings back Marinette with her family back in the train.)''

'''Tom''': ''(to Sabine)'' See? It wasn't our fault!
''(Marinette laughs.)''

{{Scene|Scene: Interior, [[Musée Grévin]]. Robustus is de-akumatized, and reverts back to his normal self, Markov.}}
<poem>
'''Markov''': ''(to Scarabella)'' You are not the usual holder of the Ladybug Miraculous.
'''Scarabella''': Umm...
'''Cat Noir''': Nope, but you were lucky enough to have been saved by the one and only Scarabella, in person. I don't you understand how you solved all of this, but... ''(raises his fist)''
'''Scarabella and Cat Noir''': Pound it!

{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair|Shadow Moth's lair]].}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': Hack-San, I release you from your existence. 
''(He snaps fingers as the amok is released from his staff and gets purified. Hack-San, who is connected to Nathalie's tablet, disappears. Nathalie frowns.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': You had beginner's luck, Scarabella. But I have experience, and I ''will'' triumph in the end!
''(The lair window closes shut.)''

{{Scene|Scene: Exterior, [[Gare du Nord]]. Marinette's family have returned from London. Alya walks with them.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': And that's the tower of London, where we tried to imprison Aunt Shu Yin!
'''Tom''': But the guards didn't want her! ''(laughs)''
'''Sabine''': I heard that, Tom!
'''Tom''': ''(runs towards Sabine)'' Honey! That's not what I meant!
''(Alya and Marinette laugh together.)''
'''Sabine''': You better watch yourself...
'''Alya''': ''(whispers to Marinette)'' You should talk to Cat Noir. It's important.
''(Marinette's eyes widen.)''

{{Scene|Scene: On the rooftops. Ladybug swings in to join Cat Noir.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': You... must've been pretty surprised to discover there was another holder! 
''(Silence. She sits beside Cat Noir.)'' 
'''Ladybug''': I'm really sorry, Cat Noir. I should've told you. I mean, if I found out that you told someone about your secret identity, I'd... probably be upset, too. I'm really sorry I hurt your feelings.
'''Cat Noir''': You didn't hurt my feelings. You did everything right. Paris will always need a Ladybug superhero to watch over her. It's just... I realized that if one day that hero wasn't you, m'lady, since we don't know each other's identities, that means... I'd never see you again. Ever. And now, I just don't know if I can bear it.
''(Cat Noir closes his eyes sadly as Ladybug frowns. She places her hand on top of his, which brought him to his surprise.)''
'''Ladybug''': I'll never abandon you, kitty cat. ''(smiles)''
