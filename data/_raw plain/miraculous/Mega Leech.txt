<poem>
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': Some time ago, during our Space Dumpster Program, I promised Parisians the end of pollution. And now I'm keeping that promise with Project Oxygen! ''(He indicates the Project Oxygen. The audience shots some photos.)'' ''(Marinette suddenly hears and looks at Mylène and Ivan protesting while holding the signboards at the corner.)''
'''Mylène and Ivan''': ''(from the distance)'' Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen!
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': ''(notices them and sighs)'' [[Roger Raincomprix|Officer Roger]], please deal with those protesters.
'''Roger''': But Mr. Mayor, they're just kids.
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': They're protesters. Just do your job.
'''Mylène and Ivan''': Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen! Stop-
'''Roger''': Kids, uh, you need to leave now.
'''Mylène''': We can't, Officer. This is too important. They're planning to cut all these trees down.
'''Roger''': Yeah, but ultimately, there'll be less pollution.
'''Mylène''': ''(in anger)'' No, there won't! That's just what they want you to think.
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': ''(from the distance)'' Roger! Your job is not to chit-chat with the troublemakers but to maintain order.
'''Roger''': Come on, kids. Let's be reasonable.
'''Mylène and Ivan''': ''(pauses for a while and continues to protest)'' Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen! ''(Roger sighs.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Police car. Mylène and Ivan are faced in anger.}}

'''Roger''': ''(enters the car)'' Sorry, kids. I don't have a choice. I'm escorting you home to your parents. ''(starts to drive)''

'''Marinette''': Tikki, what should I do? Should I transform?
'''[[Tikki]]''': I don't know, Marinette. Usually, the police deal with bad guys, but Mylène and Ivan are good guys, right?
'''[[Tom Dupain|Tom]]''': ''(voiceover)'' Marinette!
'''Marinette''': ''(gasps)'' I'm gonna be late again! Quick, Tikki! ''(runs away with Tikki)''

{{Scene|Scene: [[Miss Bustier's classroom]]. Marinette runs fast on her way to the classroom.}}
<poem>
'''[[Caline Bustier|Miss Bustier]]''': Marinette Dupain Cheng? ''(Marinette screams after opening the door and falls down)''
'''Marinette''': ''(raises her hand)'' Present. ''(goes to her seat)''
'''Miss Bustier''': Mylène Haprèle? ''(The entire class startled up when they didn't see Mylène.)'' Mylène?
'''Marinette''': She's not here. Officer Roger took her and Ivan home because, they were holding a sit-in and blocking a bulldozer.
'''Miss Bustier''': What? ''(The class all gasp.)''
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]''': ''(looks on her phone)'' Well, they must have been protesting the city's plan to rehabilitate Place des Vosges.
'''[[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]]''': ''(gasps)'' ''(whispers to [[Max Kanté|Max]])'' What does ''rehabilitate'' mean?
'''Alya''': ''(reads the news article)'' It says here, Project Oxygen will be a breath of fresh air for Paris.
'''Marinette''': A breath of fresh air? It's weird that Mylène and Ivan would be against it.
'''Miss Bustier''': ''(slams onto the desk)'' Regardless Officer Roger has made a huge mistake. ''(calls Roger)''
''(Meanwhile in the police car, there is a call on Roger's phone and answers it.)
'''Roger''': Miss Bustier, is there a problem with Sabrina?
'''Miss Bustier''': No, your daughter is fine. However, there is a problem with Ivan and Mylène. They weren't doing anything wrong, were they?
'''Roger''': Well, it's complicated. I'm escorting them home, just following orders.
'''Miss Bustier''': Well, I'm ordering you to bring them back to Place des Vosges. I'm coming to get them. ''(ends call)'' ''(to the entire class)'' Follow me, children. Today's class will be dedicated to civics education with real-life practical experience. ''(The class eagerly starts to line up in front except Alya who starts to record a video from her phone.)''
'''Alya''': ''(on the video)'' Hey, Ladybloggers! Just because there aren't any supervillains attacking Paris right now doesn't mean there's nothing super going on. ''(shows Miss Bustier opening the door)'' We've never seen Miss Bustier so worked up, so get ready to see some action. Stay connected, peeps!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Place des Vosges]]. The audience gathered around the side of the square with Mayor Bourgeois.}}
<poem>
'''[[List of minor characters/Humans#Hessenpy|Hessenpy]]''': The chainsaw is in good condition. ''(checking the chainsaw)'' It will be operated only by an adult who has read the instruction manual. ''(gives the chainsaw and a helmet to him)'' Everything's in order, you may proceed. ''(thumbs up)''
''(Mayor Bourgeois is about to cut down a tree when Miss Bustier speaks abruptly.)''
'''Miss Bustier''': Mr. Mayor, what are you doing?!
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': I am rehabilitating the Place des Vosges square.
'''Miss Bustier''': By cutting down a tree?!
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': Yes, but, I- ''(Mylène and Ivan continues to protest.)''
'''Roger''': Shh! Shh! Uhhh, Miss Bustier told me to do it.
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': Who pays your salary, Roger?!
'''Roger''': You do, Mr. Mayor. I, I mean, Paris City Hall does.
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': You obey me! Take those troublemakers right back home!
''(Roger is about to turn around to Mylène and Ivan when Miss Bustier stops him.)''
'''Miss Bustier''': Roger, don't do this!
'''Roger''': ''(looks at the two, confused)'' Whose orders am I supposed to follow?
'''Mylène''': Stop Project Oxygen!
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': You see? I can't rehabilitate in peace. They're disrupting my ceremony.
'''Mylène''': That's because your project is unethical and uneco-friendly!
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': Nonsense! Look here! ''(clicks on the remote)''
''(They all gasp when they're about to see the commercial. The commercial starts with the Tsurugi brand and the Gabriel brand. Smoke is around caused by the cars and the factories belching.)''
'''Commercial''': Because air is life, the city is teaming up with Paris's most significant investors. ''(The smoke slowly covers the sky, which the mom and her daughter felt hopeless. The Oxygen Tower releases the breeze of fresh air.)'' To transform pollution into pure fresh air, that will then be sold in unique container designed by fashion mogul, Gabriel Agreste. ''([[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] is floating over the clouds spraying some fresh air around him.)''
'''Adrien''': Oxygen isn't just a breath of fresh air. It's life itself. ''(sprays the entire screen)''
'''Commercial''': Oxygen! Get a whiff of life. ''(It ends with the Oxygen Tower with Adrien and the Oxygen Tower.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(lovestruck)'' He is so beautif- ''(Alya points out Marinette to Adrien.)'' Oh, I meant, it… is so beautiful, your commitment… to save the planet.
'''Adrien''': Father told me it was an ad for a new cologne.
'''Kim''': So that's rehabilitating? It actually looks kinda cool.
'''[[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]]''': Yeah, what's not ecological about it, Mylène?
'''[[Rose Lavillant|Rose]]''': It's super eco-friendly, it'll de-pollute the air in Paris and make it fresh! ''(spins around frantically)''
'''Mylène''': ''(sighs disappointedly)'' You're letting yourselves be fooled by pretty pictures shown like that. Project Oxygen seems great, but when you look closer at the details, it just doesn't hold up. In reality, they're cutting down ''(indicates the trees around them)'' our best natural filters, trees. ''(indicates the Oxygen Tower)'' And replacing them with artificial filters, their tower, and making us pay for all of it. ''(turns to Mayor Bourgeois)'' Mr. Mayor, instead of destroying all these trees, wouldn't it be better to build more parks?
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': Well-
'''[[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]''': ''(interrupts)'' Who cares about a lame ugly tree when you can have a gorgeous designer container from Adrikins' daddy, Gabriel Agreste instead? ''(Adrien looks down)'' Besides, there'll be a tree on the label, much prettier than the real thing.
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': And the floor in the tower will be built with recycled wood from the trees we cut down. Very eco-friendly.
'''Chloé''': And real trees have to be watered. Talk about wasting water! ''(Mylène starts to get scared when Marinette puts an arm on her shoulder.)''
'''Marinette''': Mayor Bourgeois, perhaps Mylène and Ivan have misunderstood your project. Do you really want to take away the trees, a natural and cost-free air filter, and replace them with a tower that will absorb polluted air? So that afterwards, you can clean the air and sell it back in plastic bottles. The same bottles which will become trash and pollute our oceans?
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': Yes, that’s it. ''(All of them gasp; Marinette smirks.)''  Uh, I mean, no. Of course not! It’s not that simple. Ecology is complicated, especially for children your age. Leave these things to the adults.
''(Alya continues to film and faces the camera on Mayor Bourgeois)''
'''Alya''': So actually, your project is all about cutting down our trees and closing our favorite park. ''(faces the camera on Miss Bustier)''
'''Miss Bustier''': And if Mylène and Ivan are trying to stop this, then we are on their side.
'''Marinette''': It’s true. The Mayor’s solution for fighting pollution is misguided.
'''Mylène''': Like so many other so-called miracle solutions that are supposed to deal with ecological problems, the thing is there’s never just one simple solution that can fix everything. What we need are lots of small solutions that can tackle the problem all at the same time. That’s why there has to be a lot of us all working together.
'''Marinette''': Good thing you and Ivan got involved to stop this, but why didn’t you guys tell us about it? The whole class would have come with you. ''(Ivan comes to Mylène, both looking sad and disappointed.)''
'''Mylène''': We did, Marinette. ''(shows the flashbacks of them protesting while schoolmates are having a conversation outside the school, Max and Kim are carrying their lunch, and Alix is listening with her headphones)'' We've been demonstrating against Project Oxygen for the past six months and we did everything we could to get your attention.
'''Marinette''': We're so sorry. We were just so busy doing... I don't know what it was we were doing.
'''Rose''': We're so lame.
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': This is all very touching but I've got a project to launch.
'''Mylène''': ''(stops him)'' Stop Project Oxygen! ''(Her classmates starts to join her protest. Alya, on the other hand, takes a video of them.)''
'''Class''': Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen!

<poem>
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': Roger, do something, will you?!
'''Roger''': To tell you the truth, Mr. Mayor, I've been thinking and it seems like these kids are onto something.
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': You're not paid to think, Roger, but to obey!
''(Various civilians come to stop the project)''
'''Tom''': You lost your mind, Mr. Mayor? These are just kids!
'''Fred''': I support my daughter one hundred percent.
'''Nora''': No one's messing with any trees on my watch!
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': I'm trying to help you people! ''(infuriated)'' Ah, you're all being ridiculous!
'''Adrien''': ''(walks over to Marinette)'' Sorry, Mayor Bourgeois, but we can't let you do this. ''(He holds Marinette's hand. Marinette suddenly blushes.)''
''(Wayhem arrives with a few other people)''
'''[[Wayhem]]''': ''(with his Adrien cutout)'' Adrien wants to save the trees, we're gonna save the trees! ''(everyone cheers)''
'''[[Nadja Chamack|Nadja]]''': Mr. Mayor, it seems everyone is opposed to Project Oxygen, including Adrien Agreste, even though his own father is involved. Are you going to resign?
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': Yes, I mean no, I don't know.

'''People in the video''': Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen! ''(A call from Mayor Bourgeois pops out from his computer and answers it.)''
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': ''(on call)'' Gabriel, it's André. I'm a bit overwhelmed here with our project, I need your help.
'''Gabriel''': Don't worry, André. I'm sure you'll find a way to change people's minds. When one fights for a good cause, one always finds a solution. ''(ends call; André whimpers)'' And if you don't find a solution, my old friend, destiny will come to your aid. ''(He presses the buttons from the painting of Emilie and heads to [[Hawk Moth's lair|his lair]].)''

'''Shadow Moth''': A powerful man rendered powerless. His plans disappear into thin air. This calls for the strongest of actions. ''(pulls out a feather and creates an amok and creates an akuma)'' Amok, akuma, go forth and evilize our dear Mayor. ''(the akuma and amok flies out)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Place des Vosges. Mayor Bourgeois is devastated when the akuma and amok enter to his sash.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Malediktator, I am Shadow Moth. They're challenging your authority? Why bother trying to convince them when you can make them change their minds?
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': I'd like to, Shadow Moth, but I can't be everywhere and control all my fellow citizens at once.
'''Shadow Moth''': You can't do this alone, but it's only because you're lacking a good deputy. I'm giving you the power to create your own sentimonster to assist you. This will allow you to be everywhere at once and force everyone to agree with you. All I ask in return are Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous. 
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': Excellent political strategy, Shadow Moth. ''(transforms into Malediktator)'' ''(reporters gasp)'' Greetings, my fellow citizens!  ''(summons Mega Leech)'' By the power vested in me, Mega Leech, '''''clone me!''''' ''(enters Mega Leech's mouth and releases millions of tiny clones of him)''
'''Mini-Malediktator''': Here I am, my fellow citizens! ''(Another clone of him enters Nino's ear.)''
'''Mini-Malediktator''': ''(clears his throat)'' Now, fellow citizens!
'''Nino''': ''(possessed)'' I will be everywhere!
'''Reporters''': Everywhere! ''(runs away)''
'''Kim''': Oh, so that's rehabilitating. ''(a clone enters on his ear)'' I'm root for clean air, my fellow citizens! ''(starts to kick a tree)''
'''Max''': ''(a clone enters his ear and he joins Kim)'' You've got it, my fellow citizens!
''(Marinette and Adrien runs away to find a place to hide, while Nadja, Tom, [[Alix Kubdel|Alix]], Rose, [[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]], and Nora starts to destroy the trees around them. Meanwhile, a clone tries to enter to Mylène and Ivan pushes her away.)''
'''Ivan''': NOOOOOO! ''(The clone enter Ivan's ear instead.)'' And I find that! Long live Project Oxygen, my fellow citizens!
'''Ivan''': ''(Mylène runs away whereas Adrien hides behind a column.)''
'''Adrien''': Come on!

''(Alya tries to avoid multiple clones from entering her ear when Cat Noir hits a clone with his staff.)''
'''Mini-Malediktator''': Oh, I forbid you to touch me, my fellow citizen!
'''Cat Noir''': And I forbid you to forbid me, Mr. Mini-Mayor! ''(slingshots the clone away)''
'''Alya''': ''(a clone enters)'' Get Cat Noir, my fellow citizens! ''(Ivan, Kim, and Max chase him after.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Malediktators, seize his Miraculous!
''(Cat Noir fights them back and lands on the fountain.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(worried)'' I don't know where you are, but I can sure use a helping claw, m'lady.

'''Mylène''': ''(appears)'' Marinette, we can't stay here! ''(grabs her arm)'' Follow me! ''(opens the manhole)'' Come on, we can hide down there.
'''Marinette''': Oh, yeah, but I... I can't. I... I'm afraid of sewers.
'''Mylène''': There's no shame in being afraid, Marinette. I'm scared, too, of the dark, of humidity, of germs, and even mice! I was really frightened about protesting this morning but I plucked up my courage, and managed to do it anyway. Now we've got to escape and find a way to help the others. If you ever get too scared, just hold this badge ''(gives her badge to her)'' and remember, fear is a natural reflex but you can overcome it.

Help us to de-pollute Paris, my fellow citizens! ''(Mylène runs away in fright. Tikki appears.)'' I know, that wasn't very cool, but I had no choice. Come on, Tikki, we need Ladybug!

'''Ladybug''': That was a close one.
'''Mini-Malediktator''': Hey, let me go!
'''Ladybug''': [[Lucky Charm]]! ''(recieves an ice skate)'' An ice skate?
'''Mini-Malediktator''': Release me! You must respect my authority, my fellow citizen! I demand that you stop! ''(Using her Lucky Vision, she sees his sash and the metal blades under the ice skate. She uses the blades to tear his sash apart causing the akuma and amok to be released. The clone detransforms into tiny Mayor Bourgeois.)''
'''Cat Noir''': You make it look so simple, m'lady.
'''Ladybug''': No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to deevilize! ''(captures the akuma and the amok)'' Gotcha! ''(releases the butterfly and the feather)'' Bye, bye! ''(about to throw the ice skate into the air)'' Miraculous-
'''Cat Noir''': Ladybug, look! It didn't work.''(They see people who are still controlled by the clones and Mega Leech continues to release more clones.)''
'''Clones''': Take their Miraculous, my fellow citizens! ''(The clones starts to chase Ladybug and Cat Noir.)''
'''Ladybug''': The akumas and the amoks must have multiplied at the same time as the Malediktators, capturing just one doesn't solve the problem. There are millions of them!
'''Cat Noir''': So what's the miracle solution, m'lady?
'''Ladybug''': The thing is there's no one miracle solution. What we need are lots of small solutions that can all tackle at the same time. That's why there has to be a lot of us working together. And I know who can help us! Buy us some time, Kitty Cat.
'''Cat Noir''': How come I'm always the one who has to buy some time? Catch you later! Woohoo! ''(He starts to distract them on top of [[Obélisque de Louxor]] So you want my Miraculous, fellow citizens? Then come and get it! ''(Ladybug starts to run away.)''

<poem>
'''Ladybug''': ''(appears)'' Mylène?
'''Mylène''': Don't waste your time on me, Ladybug. This is all my fault. I wanted to save the trees and because of me, everyone is uprooting them. If I hadn't gotten involved, none of this would have happened.
'''Ladybug''': You're wrong. You're not the problem, you're the solution. You've got great ideas. ''(opens her yoyo)'' Mylène Haprèle, here is the  Miraculous of-
'''Mylène''': ''(interrupts)'' No, Ladybug! I can't be a superhero. I'm scared of everything. Look, I have a badge for my fear of water, one for my fear of beasts. I need a necklace to help me get over my fear of badges!
'''Ladybug''': Do you realize how many fears you've managed to overcome? The objects that help you get over your fears are just like the Miraculous and you fight everyday to defend a cause without anyone noticing. That's just like having a secret identity. And this, you already are a superheroine. You just need one last badge. ''(Mylène is now convinced at last. She opens her yoyo once again and takes out the [[Mouse Miraculous]].)'' Mylène Haprèle, I am proud to entrust you with the Miraculous of the mouse. You will use it for the greater good.
''(Mylène takes the Miraculous and [[Mullo]] as a bright ball flies around her and then appears.)''
'''Mullo''': BOO! ''(scares Mylène and then chuckles)''
'''Ladybug''': Mullo, that's not nice. ''(to Mylène)'' True courage is not the absence of fear. It's persevering even though you're scared.
''(Mylène wears the Miraculous.)''
'''Mullo''': You only have to say one thing. Mullo, get squeaky!
<center> '''''[Transformation Sequence]''''' <br /> '''Mylène''': Mullo, get squeaky! <br />''(Mylène transforms into Polymouse.) </center>
'''Polymouse''': Wow! ''(amazed by her costume)''
'''Ladybug''': With you here, I know that we can do this. ''(gets the ice skate)'' This will help each other Mini-Malediktators' sashes. ''(Ladybug and Polymouse starts to run off.)'' You'll release the amok and akuma from every Mini-Malediktator in Paris by calling upon your special power of Multiplication.
'''Polymouse''': But what about the sentimonster? It'll just clone more.
'''Ladybug''': You free the Parisians, I'll deal with the sentimonster.
'''Polymouse''': How are you gonna do that?
'''Ladybug''': We just need a lot of people to take on the problem at the same time.
'''Polymouse''': That's what I always say about the fight for the environment.
'''Ladybug''': I told you, you have great ideas.
''(They stop at the wind turbine directing up to the grate. Polymouse hesitates for a while.)''
'''Ladybug''': It's the only way to quickly spread your powers throughout Paris. It's natural to be scared but you can...
'''Polymouse''': ...overcome my fear and go on despite it. I know. I'm not scared, I can do this. I'm not scared, I can do this. I'm not scared, I can do this! ''(jumps to the wind turbine)'' [[Multitude]]! ''(clones millions of her and passes through the grate)''

{{Scene|Scene: Place des Vosges.}}
<poem>
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': Parisians, I have heard the voices of our young people. They are our future, the future where the Place des Vosges will remain and the trees will continue to clean our air. ''(audience cheers)''
'''Hessesnpy''': ''(checking the shovel)'' This shovel is in good condition and will be operated only by an adult who has read the instruction manual. You may proceed. ''(Mayor Bourgeois starts to dig.)''
'''Miss Bustier''': On behalf of your constituents, Mr. Mayor. I'd like to thank you for the wise decision you've just made.
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': I only did what was right, Miss Bustier.
'''Marinette''': Congratulations, Mylène! You and Ivan won the battle.
'''Mylène''': We all won together, Marinette.
'''Mayor Bourgeois''': ''(struggles)'' Goodness, it really is quite difficult to plant a tree.
'''Mylène''': We'll help you, Mr. Mayor.
'''Marinette''': It's good that we finally opened our eyes even though you looked gorgeous in that commercial.
'''Adrien''': What was that, Marinette?
'''Marinette''': Uh, nothing! I just wanted to say that it was great that we all opened our eyes to the complex problems that were hiding behind that gorgeous commercial. That's what I meant, and not at all what I said before. ''(laughs uncomfortably while shoving away Alya along with herself)''

<poem>
'''Gabriel''': Adrien, you took a stand against me today.
'''Adrien''': I didn't take a stand against you, Father. I took a stand against a project that my friend showed me that was bad for Paris and for the planet.
'''Gabriel''': ''(waves his hand)'' Adrien. Go to your room.
'''Adrien''': ''(saddened)'' Yes, Father. ''(walks away past him)''
''(Gabriel turns around and twists Emilie's [[Graham de Vanily Twin Rings|ring]] on his finger)''
