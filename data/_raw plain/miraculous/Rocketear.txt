{{Scene|Scene: At the Stadium. [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] and [[Nino Lahiffe|Carapace]] are keeping four dinosaurs in Carapace's [[Shell-ter]] and waiting for [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]].}}
<poem>
'''Carapace''': Hey, do you think T-Rexes eat a lot?
'''Cat Noir''': Well, we're about to find out unless Ladybug gets back real soon!
''(Ladybug shows up, and she is with [[List of minor characters/Humans#Anne-Jeanne%20Th.C3.A9oxanne%20du%20Bocquale|Anne-Jeanne Théoxanne du Bocquale]])''
'''Ladybug''': Yeah, it's all good! We found the dino call!
'''Anne-Jeanne''': ''(chuckles)'' It rolled under my cyclotron.
''(One of the dinosaurs breaks Carapace's protective shield. Anne-Jeanne blows through her call and relieves the dinosaurs.)''
'''Anne-Jeanne''': Oh, yes! ''(rubs one of the T-Rex's belly)'' Who's the good little T-Rex? You are! Coochie-coochie-coochie-coochie-coo!!
''(Ladybug notices Carapace is sad.)''
'''Ladybug''': Everything okay, Carapace?
'''Carapace''': Oh, yeah! ''Yeah, yeah''.
'''Carapace, Ladybug and Cat Noir''': Pound it!
'''Ladybug''': ''(To Anne-Jeanne)'' Good luck with your good little T-rexes, Mrs. du Bocquale!
''(Ladybug, Carapace and Cat Noir leap away.)''
'''Anne-Jeanne''': Bye! ''(waves her hand)''
''(Dinosaur distracts Annie-Jeanne)''
'''Anne-Jeanne''': Maybe it wasn't the best idea to bring you dinosaurs back to life. What am I gonna do with you guys now? You're gonna eat my entire food budget.
''([[Bob Roth]] appears in a helicopter with a speaker.)''
'''Bob Roth''': I'll buy them from you! I'll put them on an island and turn it into a theme park! I'll be rich! ''(laughs)''

{{Scene|Scene: Paris Rooftops. Cat Noir is going back home, Carapace is going at safe place with Ladybug to hand-over Miraculous, whereas [[Alya Césaire|Rena Furtive]] is hiding behind the wall.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': Catch you later!
''(Rena Furtive witnesses they are going back safely.)''
'''Carapace''': Shell off! ''(detransforms)''
''(Nino Lahiffe hands over the [[Turtle Miraculous]] back to Ladybug.)''
'''Ladybug''': Thanks! ''(notices Nino is still upset.)'' Something's wrong, isn't it?
'''Nino''': Well, uh..., well, why wasn't Alya- I mean, Rena Rouge, here today?
'''Ladybug''': Oh, uh... because we needed you and... only you, and you've rocked it! Way to go!
'''Nino''': I did?
'''Ladybug''': Mm-hmm. ''(about to leave)'' Bug out! ''(leaves)''
''(Nino still feels upset and sadly leaves.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Sewers. Ladybug opens the lid and goes down while Rena Furtive hides behind a wall.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': We weren't followed? No sign of Shadow Moth's traps?
'''Rena Furtive''': Nothing to report.
'''Ladybug''': Perfect! Spots off! ''(de-transforms into Marinette)''
'''Rena Furtive''': ''(simultaneously)'' Let's rest! ''(de-transforms into Alya)''
'''Marinette''': ''(about to climb up the ladder she came through, but pauses)'' Alya, I wanted to ask you something.
'''Alya''': Ah, you noticed! It's crazy how my costume automatically adapted to my new role. And it gave me the idea for my new name - Rena Furtive!
'''Marinette''': Cool, yes, but secret. We agreed that officially the Miraculous of the Fox doesn't have a holder anymore. Alya, you did tell Nino that you would never be Rena Rouge again, right?
'''Alya''': Well, it's just...
'''Marinette''': Alya! Everyone has to believe that you can never use a Miraculous again. That way, you can be our spy without anyone suspecting.
'''Alya''': ''(interrupts)'' And cover you with my power of illusion if Shadow Moth has you followed or if he ever shows himself, I can follow him. I know, I know. ''(gets upset)''
'''Marinette''': For the plan to work, no one can know about it. And no one means ''no one''. Even Nino has to believe that you'll never be Rena Rouge again!
'''Alya''': Or... Rena Furtive?
'''Marinette''': Or Rena Furtive!
''(Alya groans.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. Marinette and Alya are discussing about her relationship with Nino.}}
<poem>
'''Alya''': ''(upset)'' I just don't know if I can lie to Nino like that we share everything and...
'''Marinette''': It's too late to turn back now. Tell yourself that it's not really lying. It's more-
'''Alya''': ''(interrupts)'' It's more like you don't lie to your boyfriend. If Nino ever finds out, he'll never trust me again.
'''Marinette''': I had to keep the truth from my best friend for a very long time, so I know how you feel.
'''[[Tom Dupain|Tom]]''': Girls! ''(appears a rainbow background)'' How about an Ultimate Mecha Strike 23 Tournament!
'''Marinette''': Woah! Sorry, but, uh, we're doing homework, Dad! ''(shoves him away and closes the trapdoor)''
'''Tom''': ''(opens the trapdoor)'' Again?! Your teacher sure gives you loads of homework!
'''Marinette''': ''(closes the trapdoor again and turns around to Alya)'' And see, I still have to lie to my family. It's been months since I hung out with my dad but... we don't have a choice. We've got to protect our superhero secrets.
'''Alya''': ''(sighs)'' Fine, I'll tell him.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Césaire apartment]], In [[Alya's room]], Nino is laying on Alya knee's.}}
<poem>
'''Alya''': ''(stutters)'' I-I, um...
'''Nino''': ''(lies on Alya's lap while reading a book)'' Somebody wants to play [[Super Penguino]]!
'''Alya''': There's something we gotta talk about first.
'''Nino''': ''(sits)'' What?
'''Alya''': ''(stutters)'' Uh, I, uh..., ''(groans)'' I can't do this, it's too hard.
'''Nino''': ''(worried)'' You're starting to worry me.
'''Alya''': If I do this, it might change so much between us.
'''Nino''': ''(stands up)'' Oh, no! Don't say it anything but that!
'''Alya''': Anything but what?
'''Nino''': You don't love me anymore!
'''Alya''': What? No! Of course, I do!
'''Nino''': What is it, then?
'''Alya''': ''(holds his hands)'' Nino, it's about our superhero secrets. Ladybug and I had a chat and... Okay. I'm no longer Rena Rouge and I never will be. Ladybug won't give me a Miraculous ever again, she thinks it's become too dangerous.
'''Nino''': That all makes sense. It was so weird you're not being there with us last time. Well, it's a super bummer for sure but if Ladybug thinks it's better for you, ''(hugs her)'' why are you so scared to tell me? You know we can share everything and nothing will ever change that.
'''Alya''': Yeah, we can share everything.
''(Alya hugs him back.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Miss Bustier's classroom]]. Alya is still upset.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(whispers to her ear)'' You did the right thing. It's safer to protect our secrets.
'''Alya''': Yeah, it's probably better that way. ''(smiles)''
''(Nino smiles back at her.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Collège Françoise Dupont]], outside. Adrien and Nino do their secret handshake before Adrien leaves while the other students are leaving.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': It's gonna be time for our ''(air quotes)'' ''evening walk'' soon if you know what I mean.
'''Alya''': And while the ''bug'' is out patrolling with the ''kitty'', the ''sly fox'' will cover them in case the ''mean old moth'' sets up- ''(gasps)'' Oh, I've been meaning to show you something. I took a few selfies with my new costume. There are tons of details I'm sure you missed. Check this out! ''(shows her new costume on [[Alya's cellphone|her phone]])'' Right by the neckline, isn't it way cool?
'''Marinette''': ''(upset)'' Alya...
'''Alya''': I think I like it better than the old one. Oh, what if I did a survey on the [[Ladyblog]] and let people vote on their favorite?
'''Marinette''': ''(sighs)'' Alya, Rena Furtive means Rena Invisible. No one can ever see these.
'''Alya''': Oh, right. I forgot. ''(sighs)'' Bummer, it's getting really hard to find a new material for the Ladyblog. ''(Marinette pats her head.)'' I guess I still have that raw footage of Cat Noir stunts depending on how well I edit it. ''(deletes the photo)''
'''Marinette''': ''(happy)'' Yes, that's an awesome idea. ''(hugs Alya)'' Come on, let's go.
''(They walk down the steps. The scene rewinds to Nino's perspective where Adrien leaves and Nino waves goodbye, then turns around at Marinette and Alya having a conversation. Marinette pats her head.)''
'''Nino''': ''(startled)'' Oh!
''(Marinette and Alya walk down the steps while Nino half-smiled.)''
'''Nino''': Hey! Since we got out early today, what do you say we catch a movie?
'''Alya''': Uh, I'm... not so sure.
'''Marinette''': ''(whispers to her ear)'' Go on! You have time, we'll meet up later.
'''Alya''': ''(approaches Nino)'' So, what's playing in the movies? ''(grabs his arm aggressively and runs off)''
'''Nino''': ''(while running)'' Alya! Slow down!
''(Marinette admiringly smiles at them.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Movie theater. Alya and Nino are watching the trailer of an upcoming film of Ladybug and Cat Noir.}}
<poem>
'''Trailer''': After Ladybug & Cat Noir...
'''Ladybug (in the trailer)''': ''(voiceover)'' Oh, Cat Noir, come back!
'''Cat Noir (in the trailer)''': ''(voiceover)'' I'll always love you, Ladybug!
'''Trailer''': ''(voiceover)'' Ladybug & Cat Noir 2: The Arrival of Rena Rouge.
'''Nino''': ''(annoyed)'' What about Carapace? Has everyone forgotten about Carapace?! ''(startled up to what Rena Rouge has said)''
'''Rena Rouge (in the trailer)''': Cat Noir, forget about Ladybug. You and I, we are made for each other.
'''Nino''': What?! Rena Rouge will love Cat Noir? This is totally ridiculous!
'''Alya''': Hey, Nino. It's a cartoon, a made-up story! It's just made to entertain people.
'''Nino''': Well, I, for one, am not entertained!
'''Ladybug (in the trailer)''': ''(voiceover)'' She's right, Cat Noir. You and Rena Rouge should be so much better together!
''(Alya has gone upset on her phone while Nino notices her, then, she turns off her phone quickly and smiles to him, then, Nino smiles back.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outside the Cinema.}}
<poem>
'''Nino''': Mademoiselle. ''(welcoming Alya outside the cinema)'' Should I take you home? Or..
''(Nino notices Alya once again checking her phone constantly)''
'''Nino''': That thing you were showing to Marinette on your phone earlier seemed really cool. What was it? Can I see?
'''Alya''': Oh- A thing? What thing? It was nothing. Besides, I'm just running out of battery. ''(laughs nervously)''
''([[André]] rings his ice-cream bell. Nino and Alya notices.)''
'''Nino''': Hey, look! André's over there! How about some ice cream?
''(Alya smilingly shakes her head)
'''Andrè''': Alya and Nino, my favorite lovebirds! What shall I serve you today?
''(Alya sees Ladybug who is calling her by gesturing.)
'''Alya''': Uh, nothing for me, thanks! I just remembered that I have homework to do and I'm not really hungry, anyway. You can have my half. See you later! ''(Alya leaves Nino and kissed him on his cheek.)''
'''Nino''': Thanks, André, but I guess we'll have to wait till next time.
''(Nino notices Cat Noir leaping majestically on the roofs. Nino suddenly gets distracted by three kids who are role-playing Cat Noir, Ladybug & Rena Rouge near him.)''
'''Kid 1''': Come on, Cat Noir is in love with Ladybug, not Rena Rouge!
'''Kid 2''': I don't care! I'm Cat Noir and all the girls love me!
''(Nino sadly looks down and leaves.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: the [[Seine]]. Nino is watching on the Ladyblog, where Alya is admiring Cat Noir.}}
<poem>
'''Alya''': There's a lot of talk about Ladybug, but hardly any about Cat Noir, and he's really an amazing superhero! Brave, funny, handsome; coming right up a montage of some of the most impressive stunts of a superhero who's every bit as magnificent as Prince Char-meow-ing. Stay connected!
''(Nino gets angry and calls Adrien.)
'''Nino''': I knew it! She's in love with someone else!
'''Adrien''': You guys spend every minute together. I'm sure you're just imagining things. Who else do you think she'd be in love with, anyway?
'''Nino''': ''(angrily)'' Cat Noir!
'''Adrien''': ''(laughs)'' Yeah, right. How about [[Jagged Stone]]'s [[Fang|crocodile]] while you're at it?
'''Nino''': ''(angrily)'' Did you see the video?
'''Adrien''': Come on, that's just some video from the Ladyblog, not proof.
'''Nino''': ''(angrily)'' I'll find proof, then you'll see that I was right! 
''(Nino disconnects the call)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Adrien's room]].}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': ''(to Plagg, worried)'' There's no way! 
'''Plagg''': Oh, there's a way. Yes way! My natural charisma has probably just rubbed off on you.
'''Adrien''': You think I played the charming kitty cat one too many times and unintentionally made her fall in love with me? I have to be sure! Plagg, claws out! ''(transforms into Cat Noir and jumps out of his window)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: At [[Place des Vosges]] fountain, Nearby [[Césaire apartment]]. Nino disguises himself as a detective.}}
<poem>
'''Nino''': Who would want a tormented turtle for a companion? No one could resist a kitten! ''(blows bubbles)'' This one just ripped my heart out, like a tragic sax solo and a love song. There I was, with my old buddies again: the city, the night, the solitude, the rain, pouring down, ''(his phone starts to ring)'' not like the tears that were stuck in my throat. ''(puts on a fake mustache)'' It was time to end all the lies and secrets. ''I'd always wanted to have a mustache anyway''.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Césaire apartment]]. Alya is editing on her Computer but get distracted by a knock at window.}}
<poem>
''(Alya unveils the curtain, revealing Cat Noir.)''
'''Alya''': Cat Noir!?
''(Alya opens the window and goes to talk to him, whereas Nino who is hiding, watches and records everything via his phone.)''
'''Alya''': What's going on? Is something wrong?
'''Cat Noir''': No, no! Everything's fine! It's just that I saw you posted a new video about me. I'm super flattered, really, but it made me wonder: you've been following Ladybug and me from the very start. You take photos and videos, and we even saved you a couple times. What I mean is, we're starting to know each other pretty well and... it's made me notice a couple of small things. I hope I'm just under the illusion that there's something but uh...
'''Alya''': Illusion...? What illusion? What small things?
'''Cat Noir''':  It's kind of hard to explain, but I wanted to make sure that in all this time you've spent admiring me, you haven't built up some kind of uh... feelings for me. I mean, I get it, "Hey, I am the Cat's Meow."
'''Alya''': Huh, what feelings for you?
'''Cat Noir''': Well.. you know.. ''(makes a heart on his hand)''
''(Nino zooms in his video as Alya laughs from the balcony.)''
'''Alya''': ''(laughs)'' Are you insane?! I already have a boyfriend! And FYI, with him it's not just, ''(makes a small heart on her hand)'' it's more like ''(makes a big heart with her arms)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(laughs)'' Sorry, that was so silly of me.
''(Cat Noir and Alya hug each other. Nino gets taken aback by the gesture and puts down his phone. He then returns on recording them.)''
'''Alya''': Sorry, Cat Noir, but my Nino is a ''thousand'' times more irresistible than you. ''(scratches his chin)''
''(Nino from a distance watches and starts to cry after seeing them "flirting" with each other.)''
'''Alya''': Besides, I don't really know your real identity, and I could never fall for someone I didn't really know.
''(Nino, in tears, runs off crying.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]. Adrien enters the school and sees bubbles all over him. Adrien comes forward and notices it's Nino who is creating them.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': Oh, hey, Nino! I gotta tell you something.
'''Nino''': ''(angrily)'' No! I gotta tell ''you'' something! 
'''Adrien''' Huh?
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The [[Boiler room]]. Nino takes Adrien to his table.}}
<poem>
'''Nino''': ''(sets up a chair for Adrien.)'' Sit down!
''(After offering Adrien to sit, Nino sits and puts his legs on the table.)''
'''Adrien''': Uh... when did you set all this up?
'''Nino''': I'm the one asking questions! Remember what I told you yesterday? I got proof now. What do you say to this?! ''(shows Adrien the video he recorded of Cat Noir and Alya on her balcony)''
'''Adrien''': ''(shocked)'' Uh- ''(turns the radio volume down)'' Come on, that doesn't make any sense. You're wrong, that's not at all what happened!
'''Nino''': How do you know? You were there? You're in on it too?!
'''Adrien''': No, no. Of course, not! But it's impossible! I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding. Alya and Cat Noir have nothing in common. They barely know each other! Alya is just a superhero fan she's been filming Ladybug and Cat Noir, that's all!
'''Nino''': They know each other well enough!
'''Adrien''': But no one knows Ladybug and Cat Noir's secret identities. Can you imagine Alya falling in love with someone she doesn't really know? The girl who wants to be a reporter who always wants to know the truth, no matter what? Who wants to share everything with the boy she loves?
'''Nino''': ''(turns the radio volume back on)'' They actually know each other much better than you think!
'''Adrien''': You can't assume ''that'' from this video.
''(Nino comes closer to Adrien, and tries to explain that he is right)
'''Nino''': Listen, here's what you don't know! I'm not talking about the video, dude. I'm talking about something I shouldn't be telling you. A mind-blowing secret. Alya is a superhero. She's Rena Rouge!
'''Adrien''': What?!
'''Nino''': Shh! ''(puts his finger on Adrien's lips)'' I know what you're about to say: "That's nonsense and how would Nino know that anyway?" I know because... I'm a superhero too. I'm Carapace!
'''Adrien''': Huh? You're... Carapace? But... the two of you know?! You know each other's secret identities?!
'''Nino''': Of course, Alya and I have never kept anything from each other. Until now, though that Cat Noir's business!
'''Adrien''': Wait a sec, I don't understand! I thought that secret identities had to be protected at all costs. If it were true, you'd never just tell me like that. Ladybug would never agree to that!
'''Nino''': Are you kidding? Ladybug is the one who gave us both our Miraculous at the same time.
'''Adrien''': ''(betrayed)'' No, that's impossible! 
'''Nino''': What are you trying to say? That I'm lying or something!?
'''Adrien''': No, no. What I meant was- Okay, you're Carapace, she's Rena Rouge and Ladybug's okay with this. But it still isn't like Alya or Cat Noir to be... ''(rolls his hands)'' you know...? 
'''Nino''': You don't know what Cat Noir really is but I do! I'm part of the team! I see how he acts in real life. Sure, as soon as Ladybug shows up, he throws himself at her feet with roses and big declarations, ''(smooches)'' but he gets blown off every time, because Ladybug thinks he's obnoxious, and she's right! And then whenever Rena Rouge shows up, it's like, ''(scratches Adrien's chin)'' "Why, hello there, pretty lady, you look so fine! You smell so good!" So yeah, it's easy to figure out that the first mission I missed- I mean, Carapace missed, he made his move and, BAM! This is what happened. Now, ''(sits down slowly)'' I'm all alone. I've lost the love of my life. ''(angrily)'' If I could, I'd sew his sweet talking mouth shut with his own whiskers! ''(a tear drops on the screen of his phone)''

'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]]''': A spurned boyfriend who wants vengeance on his rival. Now that's a strong emotion. ''(creates an akuma)'' Fly, my little akuma and help this young man destroy his enemy! ''My'' enemy! ''(the akuma flies out flies out the window)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Boiler room. The akuma flies over Adrien and Nino.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': There's got to be an explanation, Nino. We'll work it all out! ''(gasps as the akuma enters Nino's glasses.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Rocketear, I am Shadow Moth. Cat Noir has ripped your heart out and left you in a weeping state of sorrow. So, I'm giving your tears the power to destroy everything! All I ask for in return are-
'''Nino''': ''(interrupts)'' I know what you want, Shadow Moth. Don't worry, the only thing left to them will be their Miraculous. ''(transforms into Rocketear)''
'''Adrien''': Nino, you have to fight off this-
'''Rocketear''': ''(throws Adrien)'' You're not my enemy, Adrien. Cat Noir is! ''(jumps onto the upper hall and starts to walk away)''
'''Plagg''': I know what you're about to do but I would advise you not to, considering what your pal's got in store for Cat Noir.
'''Adrien''': I can't leave Nino like that!

<poem>
'''Alya''': And that's why he showed up in the middle of the night, because of this video I post on the Ladyblog. He thought I was in love with him.''(laughs)''
'''Marinette''': ''(facepalms)'' Oh, that Cat Noir.
''(A rumbling is heard outside. They looked at the window and saw Rocketear and Cat Noir fighting on the streets.)''
'''Rocketear''': ''(voiceover)'' Cat Noir! You stole my Alya from me! I'm going to steal your life from you! ''(He shoots tears at Cat Noir but is able to dodge from it and instead, it explodes on a car. He tries to shoot more tears at Cat Noir.)''
'''Cat Noir''': I didn't steal anyone! ''(lands on a lamppost)'' Alya still loves you!
'''Rocketear''': LIAR! I have proof! ''(continues to shoots tears)''
'''Marinette''': Oh no, this can't be happening! ''(goes behind an art desk along with Alya)''
'''Alya''': Oh, Nino, no!
'''Marinette''': ''(softly)'' We have to stop them before they hurt each other. Come on, follow me! 
''(The girls sneak away whilst the others continue to watch the battle by the window.)''

<poem>
'''Marinette''': Okay, we can transform in peace in here. ''(They notice Nino's secret office and walks towards it. Marinette also notices the video on Nino's phone.)'' Alya, don't tell me you... ''(shows the video to Alya)''
'''Alya''': Of course, not! It's a misunderstanding. If you could hear what we were saying, there's ''no'' way Nino would believe that I'm in love with Cat Noir.
'''Marinette''': Okay, fine. Let's not waste time. ''([[Tikki]] and Trixx pops out.)'' Tikki!
'''Alya''': ''(simultaneously)'' Trixx!
'''Marinette''': Spots on! ''(transforms into Ladybug)''
'''Alya''': ''(simultaneously)'' Let's pounce! ''(transforms into Rena Furtive)''
'''Ladybug''': [[Lucky Charm]]! ''(receives a [[List of Lucky Charm objects#Season 4|projector]])'' A video projector? What am I supposed to do with this? ''(lights it up)''
'''Rena Furtive''': Do like Nino and make up imaginary movies in your head?
'''Ladybug''': ''(using her Lucky Vision, she looks around and sees Rena Furtive's [[Flute|flute]], the video from Nino's phone, and the projector.)'' ''(to Rena Furtive)'' You said that if Nino could have heard what you were saying, there'd be no misunderstanding?
'''Rena Furtive''': Absolutely!
'''Ladybug''': How well do you remember what you guys said on the balcony?
'''Rena Furtive''': Every. Word.
'''Ladybug''': Do you think you could make... a sound illusion?
'''Rena Furtive''': Totally.
''(Ladybug smirks.)''

{{Scene|Scene: Streets. Rocketear shoots a tear to Cat Noir but jumps over it.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': I don't wanna fight you! 
'''Rocketear''': Silence! ''(Rocketear continues to shoot more tears.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(dodges the tears)'' Let me explain!
'''Rocketear''': ''(tries to knock him down)'' I don't wanna hear your lies!
''(Cat Noir throws Rocketear away from him.)''
'''Cat Noir''': You wanted proof? Here's proof. ''(shortens his staff and tosses it away)''
'''Rocketear''': That doesn't prove a thing! ''(He shoots tears at him, making him thrown onto a van and knocks him down one more time.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(weakly)'' See? I don't wanna hurt you. Can we talk now?
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Shut him up for good! But before you do, seize his Miraculous!
'''Rocketear''': ''(about to shoot a tear to him)'' It's over, Cat Noir!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(weakly)'' Don't do this.
''(A yoyo grabs Rocketear's wrist, misdirecting the tear and is shot on one of the buildings' roofs.)''
'''Ladybug''': Nino, stop!''(shows the projector)'' Look, my Lucky Charm gave me a super-advanced projector that will allow you to hear the sound of the video that you shot. ''(Rocketear hesitates for a moment. Meanwhile, Rena Furtive is hiding behind a wall on the rooftops, waiting for her cue to activate her power.)'' I don't know what Cat Noir said to your girlfriend either, but I trust him.
'''Rena Furtive''': ''(whispers)'' [[Mirage]]!
'''Ladybug''': Now, look and listen carefully. ''(shows a bigger screen of the video from the projector)'' ''(looks at her)''
'''Rena Furtive''': ''(uses her Mirage to create a sound for her and Cat Noir's conversation on the video)'' Well, you know...
'''Cat Noir''': ''(from the video)'' ''(repeats)'' Well, you know... ''(Alya laughs)''
''(The video made Rocketear furious but stops for a while.)''
'''Alya''': ''(from the video)'' Are you insane? I already have a boyfriend! And FYI, with him,...
'''Alya and Rena Furtive''': It's not just... it's more like... ''(gestures a bigger heart)''
'''Cat Noir and Rena Furtive''': ''(laughs)'' Sorry, that was so silly of me. ''(hugs each other)''
'''Alya and Rena Furtive''': Yeah, sorry, Cat Noir, but my Nino is a thousand times more irresistible than you. Besides, I don't know your real identity and I could never fall for someone I didn't really know.
''(Rocketear realizes the whole thing happened. In the meantime, Rena Furtive runs and hides behind a car to detransform.)''
'''Rena Furtive''': Let's rest! ''(detransforms into Alya)''
'''Alya''': Nino! ''(goes to Rocketear and hugs him)''
'''Rocketear''': I can't believe I ever doubted you.
'''Alya''': I can't believe I ever chose to do anything over spending time with you.
'''Rocketear''': I'm so sorry. ''(Alya removes his glasses and wipes away Rocketear's tear)''
'''Alya''': I was so scared for you. ''(hugs him and Rocketear hugs her back)''
'''Rocketear''': Shadow Moth! You can have your lame powers back! ''(resigns)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Oh! ''(he frowned)''
''(Rocketear turns back into Nino causing it to release the akuma.)''

{{Scene|Scene: Streets. Ladybug creates a [[Magical Charms|Magical Charm]] and give it to Nino.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': ''(takes his hand)'' Nino, take this magical charm. Always carry it with you. That way, Shadow Moth can't get to you, anymore.
'''Nino''': I won't need to use it, Ladybug. ''(holds Alya's hands)'' I'll never let Shadow Moth use my love to manipulate me again. ''(to Cat Noir)'' I guess I was wrong about you, my dude. I'm sorry. ''(tips his cap)''
'''Cat Noir''': Everyone has doubts now and then, ''(looks down)'' even me...
'''Ladybug''': Is everything okay, Cat Noir?
'''Cat Noir''': Yeah, yeah. ''(prepare his fist)'' Pound it!
'''Ladybug''': ''(fistbumps)'' Pound it!
''(Cat Noir and Ladybug runs away, whereas Cat Noir is still upset, thinking about the secrets Nino had blurted out to him earlier at the boiler room.)''

<poem>
'''Adrien''': I still can't believe Ladybug entrusted Alya and Nino with those Miraculous.
'''Plagg''': ''(while eating camembert)'' Of course she did. She's the Guardian.
'''Adrien''': But they're a couple and they know each other's secret identities.
'''Plagg''': So...? ''(eats the camembert)''
'''Adrien''': So, why does she make it a rule that we can't know each other's identities but it's okay for them?
'''Plagg''': She's the Guardian, the Grandmaster Cheese Ripener, and you and I are just cheese on the platter. She decides what's on the menu.

<poem>
'''Marinette''': I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to cause trouble between you and Nino.
'''Alya''': ''(at her balcony while on the call)'' Don't worry, I've got this. Do you trust me?
'''Marinette''': I trust you.

'''Alya''': Nino?
'''Nino''': Hmm?
'''Alya''': There's something I have to tell you.
'''Nino''': Again? You sure you don't wanna just play Super Penguino instead?
'''Alya''': ''(sighs)'' I'm still Rena Rouge. ''(Nino gasps.)'' But now I'm in hiding and that's why Ladybug asked me not to tell anyone.
'''Nino''': ''(goes to her)'' But why are you telling me if no one's supposed to know? Is Ladybug cool with this?
'''Alya''': I can't hide it from you, because I love you, Nino, and we share everything.
''(They hug each other.)''
