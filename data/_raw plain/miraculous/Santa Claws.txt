{{Scene|Scene: Streets of Paris. Adrien walks in the cold. He talks to Plagg.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' Don't worry, Plagg, I'll find you something to eat. I can't promise it'll be Camembert.
'''[[Santa Claus]]:''' Ho, ho, ho! No need to grab now, children. Good old Santa Claus has a gift for everyone.
'''Girl:''' These gifts are so lame, and I bet this is totally fake!
'''Santa:''' Hey! Easy on the beard!
'''Boy:''' Yeah! Totally. No way you're the real Santa Claus!
'''Adrien:''' Hey! What's wrong with you? Even if he's not the real one, what would Santa think of your behavior?
'''Man:''' The young man's absolutely right. Kids, say sorry right now.
'''Kids:''' Sorry, Santa Claus.
'''Santa:''' It's no big deal, children. Merry Christmas anyway.
'''Man:''' Same to you.
'''Adrien:''' I'm sorry, Sir, are you okay?
'''Santa:''' Fine. Don't worry, I'm a tough old Santa. But, what are you doing out at this time of night? Are you lost? You're not exactly dressed for the cold weather. Maybe you'd like some hot chocolate, I've got some left.
'''Adrien:''' Yeah, I'd love some, Sir, doesn't get much better than that.
''(Plagg comes out of Adrien's Christmas hat)'' 
'''Plagg:''' Ahem!
'''Adrien:''' Except maybe a slice of Camembert?
'''Santa:''' Oh you're in luck! I've still got some sandwich leftover. This is some of the smelliest cheese I've ever come across.
'''Adrien:''' Hmm, that smells… perfect.
'''Santa:''' ''(laughs)'' To each it's own. So you're not lost then, I hope.
''(Adrien feeds Plagg one slice of Camembert, he now feels better) ''
'''Adrien:''' It's my first Christmas without my mom, sir. And my father…
'''Santa:''' Doesn't know how to move on? I understand. But your dad must be wondering where you are, you know. He must be very worried about you. Now that you've gotten out of the house and cleared your thoughts a bit, don't you think it'd be a good idea to go home?
'''Adrien:''' Yeah, you're right.
'''Santa:''' Atta boy, that's what Christmas is all about. Families together. I'll take you there on my sleigh ''(puts his hat on)''.
'''Adrien:''' C'mon, Plagg. Alright, but you put this on.
'''Santa:''' Hmm?
'''Adrien:''' The friend who gave it to me would want you to have it.
'''Santa:''' A present, for me?
'''Adrien:''' Everyone deserves a Christmas present.
'''Santa:''' Thanks a lot, son.

{{Scene|Scene: Outside Hôtel de Ville. Ladybug swings by and sees the damage caused by Cat Noir's Cataclysm.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug:''' ''(singing)'' ''♫ There is only one thing this kind of damage can bring, Cat Noir's Cataclysm, am I right? And look this gift wrap too, it's an important clue, it's from my present to Adrien tonight. Adrien disappears, and Cat Noir steps in, he must be working to protect him. My only explanation, my speculation, is that some supervillain is after Adrien. It's a good thing I'm here, I'll protect him without fear, this boy that I secretly love. Now with all of my might, I'll save you tonight, you're the boy that I secretly love. If you'll never know it's true, I'll be there for you, you're the boy that I secretly love. But what would you do if you knew what's true, that's why I so secretly love you. ♫''
'''Ladybug:''' Who could possibly been akumatized on Christmas Eve? Footsteps.
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Streets of Paris. Santa Claus is taking Adrien home in his sleigh.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' How about you, sir? Where will you be celebrating Christmas?
'''Santa:''' Me? I have all of Paris. The whole world even! Ho, ho, ho!
'''Adrien:''' All by yourself, huh? Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Take me back home and have Christmas with us! I need you to bring the Christmas spirit back into our home.
'''Santa:''' All right then. But I can't stay for too long, you do know that Santa's very busy at Christmas time.
'''Adrien:''' Thank you!
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Outside the Agreste mansion. Adrien rings the doorbell while Santa is behind him, Gabriel answers.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel:''' Adrien, is that you? Who are you?
'''Santa:''' Isn't it obvious? I'm Santa Claus!
'''Gabriel:''' Really now? That would make me the Easter Bunny. You're here for money, I suppose? I'll get my bodyguard to deal with you.
'''Adrien:''' No, you're wrong, father!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(confronts them, angrily)'' No, he's not. Your father's got the right idea. He's a supervillain under Hawk Moth's control.
'''Adrien:''' What?
'''Santa:''' You're all totally crazy!
'''Adrien:''' What? No, Ladybug stop! That man hasn't been akumatized!
'''Ladybug:''' I know when I'm looking at an akuma victim, trust me.
'''Santa:''' C'mon! ''(runs away on his sleigh)''
'''Ladybug:''' You're safe now. Go on home.
'''Adrien:''' No wait! Plagg--

<poem>
'''Hawk Moth:''' Ahh. Without even knowing it, you're giving me the best Christmas gift ever, Ladybug. An innocent man wrongly accused, and the spirit of Christmas is broken! ''(he turns a butterfly into an [[Akuma|akuma]])'' Fly away, my little akuma. You have all that you need to evilize this Santa.
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Agreste mansion.}}
<poem>
'''Natalie:''' Where are you going, Adrien?
'''Adrien:''' ''(still expressing anger)'' To my room, of course, since my father isn't celebrating Christmas.
'''Nathalie:''' Of course he is Adrien. Your father came to see earlier, but you'd gone out. I'll tell him that you're waiting for him. Just making sure you'll stay in your room this time.
'''Adrien:''' Yeah, okay.
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Streets of Paris. Ladybug realizes Santa Claus is not akumatized.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug:''' You… So you're not a supervillain?
'''Santa:''' Of course I'm not! I think you've been reading too many comic books, young lady.
'''Ladybug:''' I'm so sorry, um, let me help you-
'''Santa:''' No thank you! I think you've helped me enough. ''(he walks away and Ladybug swings away)''
'''Santa:''' Nobody around here respects the spirit of Christmas anymore. ''(the akuma enters his [[List of akumatized objects|hat]])''
'''Hawk Moth:''' Well, I believe in you. Santa Claws, I am Hawk Moth. They wrongly accused you of being a supervillain, so that's what you'll get to be from now on. In exchange, since I've been good enough all year round, I'm going to ask you for two gifts. Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.
'''Santa:''' I shall deliver. Merry Christmas, Hawk Moth!
'''Santa Claws:''' Ladybug! ''(singing)'' ''♫ You think you can get away with making fun of me? You think you can get away with accusing me? I am Santa Claws! I'm a rebel with a cause! I'll punish and give you a fright! Have a horrible Christmas night. ♫'' ''(he throws her a present full of bats and flies away on his sleigh)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Agreste mansion. Adrien plays video games, while being watched by his chauffeur. Adrien drops his controllers and walks away in disappointment. To his and his chaffeur's surprise, Santa Claws appears.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' Santa Claws?
'''Santa Claws:''' Not exactly! ''(singing)'' ''♫ I am Santa Claws! I'm a rebel with a cause! I'll punish and give you a fright! Have a horrible Christmas night. ♫'' ''(throws them a present full of spiders and his chauffeur runs away in fear)'' I'll do you no harm, Adrien. I'm in your debt!
You gave me a present, and that I won't forget. In fact, I will avenge you! I'll avenge us too.
'''Adrien:''' No, wait!
'''Santa Claws:''' This will be the Christmas of revenge!

'''Cat Noir:''' The three of us, m'Lady.
'''Ladybug:''' Cat Noir? Where were you? What happened to Adrien?
'''Cat Noir:''' It's a-, long story. Cats have their little secrets too, y'know? ''(they get on Santa Claw's sleigh)'' Who's going to deliver presents to the children now, Santa Claws?
'''Santa Claws:''' There are no more presents, no more spirit of Christmas! You should've been good. ''(He throws Cat Noir a present which throws him off of the flying sleigh)''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(while falling)'' I've been good all year round!
'''Ladybug:''' Not enough, apparently. ''(She dives down to save him)'' Hang on! ''(she ties her yo-yo to Santa Claw’s sleigh)''
'''Santa Claws:''' How 'bout a nice sleigh ride, my little, wretched elves! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Hold on!
Here we go!
'''Cat Noir:''' Don't you have to have a license to drive one of these things?
'''Santa Claws:''' It's time to open your gifts, kiddies!
'''Ladybug:''' I'm gonna try to stop the sleigh. You deal with Santa Claws! ''(Cat Noir fight with Santa Claws. Ladybug gets on one of the reindeer)'' Woah, slow down! ''(Santa Claws falls off the sleigh, but Cat Noir catches him)''

<poem>
'''Santa Claws:''' It's me.
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(singing)'' ''♫ Santa, you're the winner. We stand down and surrender. We fear you have defeated us, so we give you our Miraculous. But beforehand, here is a gift for you. 'Cause on Christmas Eve, even you have a right to that too. ♫''
