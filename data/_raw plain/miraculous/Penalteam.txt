'''[[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]]''': Hmm. I choose—Max!
''([[Max Kanté|Max]] walks next to Kim, along with [[Markov|Markov]], and holds a yellow jersey)''
'''Kim''': Markov, who's gonna give me 100% chance of winning?
'''Markov''': Processing. ''(Markov prints out a slip of paper with his answer, to which Kim then takes and reads it)''
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]''': Alya! ''([[Alya Césaire|Alya]] rushes over to Marinette's side)''
'''Kim''': Oh no, Alya was Markov's pick.
'''Marinette''': Hey, using Markov is cheating!
'''Kim''': Well we're gonna need the best players if we're gonna win right?
'''[[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]''': Since we obviously know who's gonna win, there's no point in playing. I'm going home.
'''[[Caline Bustier|Miss Bustier]]''': Nobody's going home and nobody's going to cheat. I specifically asked [[Didier Roustan|Mr. Didier]] to join us to teach you how to play together and develop some team spirit.
'''Didier Roustan''': Yes, in soccer. What's important is not winning or losing, but enjoying yourselves by playing together. Together means not only with your teammates, but with everybody on the field.
'''Kim''': And I really like playing with my opponents. Especially when we're crushing them.
'''Didier Roustan''': Can you all think of ways to make teams more fair?
'''[[Alix Kubdel|Alix]]''': We can try girls against boys! ''([[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]], [[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]], [[Rose Lavillant|Rose]], and [[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]] pose behind Alix)''
'''Kim''': No way we'd lose again!
'''Rose''': I know! By alphabetical order of the names of our teddy bears.
'''Alya''': Rose, you're the only one who still has a teddy bear.
'''[[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]]''': You and Chloé.
'''Chloé''': Of course I have a teddy…Uhhh I mean ridiculous, utterly ridiculous.
'''Marinette''': Why don't we draw for it?
'''Rose''': Oh yeah, that's a great idea! (The rest of the class (minus Chloé) cheer)
''(Miss Bustier and Didier Roustan nod at each other)''

<poem>
'''[[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Nathaniel]]''': ''([[Marc Anciel|Marc]] dragging Nathaniel into the arena)'' I don't see what's so great about running around chasing a ball and what if I hurt my hand. I wouldn't be able to draw comics anymore.
'''Marc''': Nath, you play soccer with your feet, your hands will be fine and it's fun you'll see. Soccer is all about Bicycle kicks, Marseille turns, Rainbow kicks, and since you like stories so much just wait, a good game is full of exciting twists and turns. Like a good manga!
'''Nathaniel''': Well, I'd still rather be working on our comic.
'''Marc''': But you can't skip the class, don't you realize? Miss Bustier got Mr. Didier to come here. He's a legend in sports journalism, a real walking encyclopedia of soccer.
'''Nathaniel''': Oh, come on Marc! Think of an excuse for me please? You're the writer after all. And that way you'll get to meet Mr. Didier.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Parc des Princes]]}}
<poem>
'''Marc''': And so…that's why he can't be here for this class.
'''Miss Bustier''': That means we're missing a player.
'''Didier Roustan''': Wouldn't you like to play?
'''Marc''': ''(Points to himself)'' Uh…No I…This isn't my class and I'm not all that good. ''(looks down)''
'''Didier Roustan''': It's your call. Uh mind passing me that ball over there before you go?
''(Marc rolls the ball to himself, begins juggling with his knees and passes the ball to Didier Roustan)''
'''Marinette''': You absolutely have to play!
''(Marc looks at Didier Roustan, who smiles and winks)''
''(The two teams set up in their posistions. The red team with Juleka playing in goal. Alya, Rose and Alix playing in defense. Marc and Marinette as midfielders and Sabrina in the striker position. Among the yellow team is Chloé, who's posing for pictures on her phone. Max, [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] and Mylène as their defenders. Nino and [[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]] playing as midfielders and Kim as the yellow team striker)''
'''Didier Roustan''': ''(Blows whistle)''
''(The yellow team starts the kickoff. Kim attempts to pass the ball to Nino, but Sabrina immediately takes possession, begins running towards the yellow team's goal and is about to shoot the ball into the goal. 
'''Chloé''': Sabrina!
'''Sabrina''': ''(Falls, looks up at Chloé)''
'''Chloé''': I forbid you to play this stupid game!
''(Marinette kneels aside Sabrina)''
'''Marinette''': Don't listing to Chloé, you're allowed to play soccer if you like it. ''(Helps Sabrina off the ground)''
'''Chloe''': The only thing she likes is obeying me! ''(Chloé pushes Sabrina aside and turns face to face with Marinette)''
'''Mylène''': Sorry Sabrina. Go ahead Teddy Bear. ''(Mylène takes possession of the ball and pass it to [[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]])'' 
'''Ivan''': But I might hurt someone if I kick to hard or jostle them.
'''Rose''': Sorry! ''(Rose steals the ball from Ivan and passes it to Marc)''
''(Marc receives the pass with his chest and passes it to Marinette in the air. It flies pass Kim and Nino)''
'''Kim''': Awesome!
''(Marinette receives the pass with her knee and rolls it to the ground. She begins dribbling to the goal but freezes once she comes across Adrien)'' 
'''Marinette''': ''(smiles nervously and accidentally passes it to him)'' Oops.
'''Nino''': Dude quick, pass it! ''(Nino runs pass Adrien)''
''(Adrien picks up the ball with his hands and throws it to Nino, who then frowns)''
'''Didier Roustan''': ''(Blows whistle)'' Handball! Like my friend Andrea said: "Football is played with the head. Your feet are just the tools." But yeah, only the goalie can touch the ball with their hands.
'''Adrien''': Oh, sorry I'm not that familiar with the rules.
''(Nino facepalms. Alya places the ball in the spot for a free kick. She is about to kick the ball but instead, passes it to Marinette who shoots and scores a goal.)''
'''Didier Roustan''': Oh! Reminds me if my friend Michelle at '84.
'''Kim''': Hey Chloé you're the one who's supposed to stop the ball!
'''Chloé''': ''(Still looking at her phone)'' There is no way I'm touching that round thing. I don't wanna catch some kind of disease or even worse lameness!
'''Sabrina''': I can replace you if you want? I love being the goalie.
'''Alya''': But you're not even on her team!
'''Nino''': If we don't have a real goalie then it's a losing battle.
'''Chloé''': I refuse to be on a team of losers, I'm going home!
'''Miss Bustier''': Ah-Ah. Chloé you cannot go home during school hours.
'''Marinette''': If you wanna win Chloé, then just play.
'''Chloé''': How come I can't be on the Bench with what's-her-name over there.
''([[Lila Rossi|Lila]] waves from the bench and pretends to wince)''
'''Lila''': Uh, Ow.
'''Rose''': Lila's injured.
'''Marinette''': (scoffs) Another one of her lies.
'''Chloé''': We'll I'm injured too! In my wrist. Ow! Owch! Owwie! ''(Chloé pretends to be injured by hopping around)''
'''Marinette''': That's your thigh!
'''Chloé''': Nobody asked you baker girl!
'''Didier Roustan''': Anyone have an idea how to include your classmates in the game while still keeping the game fair and engaging?
'''Marinette''': Well…Chloé could switch teams with every goal. The team that wins will be the one that did the best with his handicap.
'''Chloé''': "(Chloé looks at Marinette with shock and anger as she quickly changes her words)"
'''Marinette''': Uhh…I mean having Chloé as their goalie.
'''Kim, Max, Ivan, and Mylène''' "(cheer)"
'''Didier Roustan''': Nicely done captain. Marinette, is it?
'''Marinette''': Yes. Thank you, sir.
'''Chloé''': ''(Chloé, furious, walks away to the goal and crosses her arms)'' Well I find Dupain-Cheng's idea ridiculous, utterly ridiculous!
'''Sabrina''': Why don't you just call your father? As mayor he can just cancel this class since I…mean we hate soccer.
'''Chloe''': No need. I'm waiting for a call from someone else, someone much more powerful.

{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair|Shadow Moth's lair]].  The lair's window opens up.}}
<poem>
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]]''': Ah, Chloé Bourgeois it's been too long. Ladybug's [[Magical Charms|Magical Charm]] has put you on the sidelines, but now it's time for a rematch! ''(He turns a butterfly into an [[Akuma|Megakuma]] and sends it out)'' Time for kickoff my Megakuma. Give back all the aggressiveness to my favorite striker?
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Parc des Princes]]}}
<poem>
''(The akuma infects Chloé's glasses)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Penalty, I am Shadow Moth. Your classmates are forcing you to play soccer? I'm giving you the power to make them loathe this sport forever. To accomplish this, you'll be an invincible team with all the guarantees of winning it all, including cheating of course. In exchange...
'''Chloé''': Save your breath: victory and the Miraculous. I know.
''(Chloé transforms into Penalty)''
'''Sabrina''': Chloé!
''(Penalty creates 10 clones of herself forming the Penalteam and a yellow dome is cast over Paris)''
'''Penalty''': Huh, you wanted to play soccer? Okay, then let's play.
'''Marinette''': But I thought you didn't like soccer.
'''Penalty''': I can't stand it and I promise that when I'm done with you, you too will never wanna play this ridiculous game ever again.
'''Miss Bustier''': Chloé, vengeance is never the solution to any problem.
'''Penalty''': I'm no longer Chloé. From now on call me Penalty and here's my Penalteam!
''(Penalty chucks a red card at Miss Bustier and she disappears. Startled, Lila abruptly gets up from the bench)''
'''Marc''': Miss Bustier!
''(Alya gasps. Miss Bustier has been placed in a yellow, clear ball above the field. Marinette taps Alya's shoulder and nods at her)''
'''Penalty clone''': The first half is 45 minutes. If I win, no one will ever play soccer in this city again! Hahahahaha!
''(The Penalteam clock at the top of the stadium sets 45 minutes for the first half, Penalteam blows her whistle to start the game. She passes the Penalteam themed soccer ball to one of her clones and they start sprinting towards the other goal. Alya, Marinette, Sabrina and Alix run and stand in front of them to protect their goal)''
'''Alya''': If you play anything like Chloé, this is going to be easy! ''(Alya runs forward to try and steal the ball)''
'''Marinette''': Alya, no!
''(Penalteam slide and tag Alya with her cleat at Alya's feet, which places Alya in a yellow, clear ball above the stadium along with Miss Bustier. Marinette becomes angry and clenches her fists)''
'''Penalty''': The Penalteam is invincible you bunch of losers!''(Penalty runs, shoot the ball and scores a goal. The yellow balls, which hold Miss Bustier and Alya, shrink)''
'''Alix''': That goal doesn't count! There was a foul on Alya!
'''Didier Roustan''': She's right, that's a red card!
'''Penalty''': I get to decide the rules! ''(Penalty creates a red card and throws it Alix, which also places Alix in a yellow, clear ball. Penalty then points at Didier Roustan)'' And you, since you like to talk so much, why don't you be our official commentator. ''(She creates another red card and throws it Didier Roustan, he is placed in a yellow, clear ball)''
''(Ivan, Juleka, Rose, and Sabrina run off the field. Nino runs past Mylène, who is hiding behind a wall at the staircase. Marc and Marinette run up the rows of seats and Marinette ducks behind a row)''
'''Penalty''': Giving up already? And I thought you loved soccer! ''(Penalty shoots the ball into the goal again and scores another point. The yellow balls holding Alix, Didier Roustan, Miss Bustier and Alya shrink once more)''
'''Penalty''': But I'm warning you: The more I score, the more cramped your friends will be.
'''Didier Roustan''': ''(Gasps)'' Welcome to the Stadium of Princesses…Or not?
'''Marinette''': No intention of losing this game! Tikki, Spots On! ''(From behind the row of seats, a flash of red light appears)''
'''Plagg''': Ah, for pity's sake anything but soccer please! ''(In the arena's bathrooms)''
'''Adrien''': Sorry, but Ladybug and I are a team. Plagg, Claws Out! ''(A flash of green light appears from inside the stall)''
''(Ladybug jumps out on the soccer field)'':
'''Didier Roustan''': ''(From inside his yellow ball)'' Just when it seemed all hope was lost, Ladybug enters the field!
'''Ladybug''': You wanna play soccer? How about battling it out on an equal playing field!
'''Penalty''': Ah Ladybug! Nothing would make me happier than crushing you and your team of ridiculous losers.
'''Ladybug''': ''(Cat Noir leaps from the seats and stands next to Ladybug)'' No need for a whole team, it's just Cat Noir and me against your clones! ''(Cat Noir taps his fingers nervously together)'' We'll be so awesome you won't even see the ball! We're gonna win and de-akumatize you in no time! ''(Cat Noir nervously tries tapping her shoulder)''
'''Penalty''': (laughs) The Akuma is the trophy and trophies are for winners, not losers! ''(Penalty throws her glasses on the ground and taps it with the foot to remove the glasses, in order to confuse the heroes on which clone is the original Penalty)''
'''Ladybug''': (laughs) Nice scare tactics, but it's not gonna work. Cat Noir and I are the best at soccer!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(Whispers to Ladybug)'' I don't know a thing about soccer M'lady. Maybe it's time to call the real team?
'''Ladybug''': ''(Shocked, slowly pushes Cat Noir to guard the goals and heads off)'' Oh, well Cat Noir will attend the goals while I get the rest of our team.
'''Penalteam''': (laughs) I guess you're not that confident after all Ladybug! Let's see what you're made of kitty cat!
'''Didier Roustan''': ''(From inside his yellow ball) From the look on his face, not champion material I'm afraid.
''(Cat Noir nervously points to himself and gets ready to defend the goal. Ladybug finds Nino, Max, Mylène, Kim, Juleka, Rose, [[Luka Couffaine|Luka]], [[Zoé Lee|Zoé]], [[Kagami Tsurugi|Kagami]] and hands then their miraculouses. As Ladybug enters the staircase, Sabrina is seen in the corner curled up in a ball. Sabrina stands up abruptly once she sees Ladybug)''
'''Ladybug''': Sabrina Raincomprix, here is the [[Dog Miraculous|Miraculous of the dog]] which grants the power to fetch and return whatever your ball has touched. ''(Handing her the miraculous. Sabrina hesitantly shakes her head)''
'''Sabrina''': I'm sorry but, I can't do that to Chloé!
'''Ladybug''': That's not Chloé out there, it's Penalteam. Don't you want to set her free?
'''Sabrina''': If It's to save Chloé, then yes! Besides I love soccer! ''(More confident, she takes the Miraculous and puts it on. [[Barkk|Barkk]], as a bright ball appears in front of her)''
'''Barkk''': Hi, I'm Barkk, and I'm your kwami!
''(Ladybug finds Marc and holds out [[Rooster Miraculous|a Miraculous]] for him)''
'''Marc''': Ladybug, I'm really not that good at soccer. I- ''(Shying away and pulls his hands to his chest)''
''(Ladybug takes his hand and places the Miraculous in his hand)''
'''Ladybug''': You're too hard on yourself. You're more talented than you realize.
''(Marc slides the miraculous jewel over his left thumb. [[Orikko|Orikko]] appears in front of him as bright ball of light)''
'''Orikko''': Hi. I'm Orikko. Let's play!

{{Scene|Scene: Outside [[Parc des Princes]]. Nathaniel is holding the Goat Miraculous, having been given by Ladybug}}
<poem>
'''Nathaniel''': It's just, I'm.. flattered, Ladybug. But I don't feel comfortable being on a team. ''(tries to hand the [[Goat Miraculous]] back to Ladybug)''
'''Ladybug''': Really? Aren't you the one who's teamed up with the writer to create those Ladybug comics? You will use it for the greater good and return it to me once the job is done. Can I trust you?
''(Nathaniel smiles and places the hair clips on his head. [[Ziggy|Ziggy]] pops out and turns to him)''
'''Ziggy''': Hi, I'm your kwami, Ziggy!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Parc des Princes]]. Ivan has received the [[Ox Miraculous]] from Ladybug and looks hesitant}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': Can I trust you?
''(Ivan puts in the nose ring in his nose. [[Stompp|Stompp]] flies out next to him)''
'''Stompp''': Hi, I'm Stompp. Let's add some muscle to this game.
'''Ivan''': What if I hurt someone using my superpowers?
'''Ladybug''': It's good to be careful, Ivan, but remember, you'll be on a team of superheroes facing supervillains! No one can be hurt. ''(Ivan, reassured, smiles)''
''(Back on the soccer field, the goal Cat Noir is supposed to be defending appears to have its polls bent, the net ripped and smoke coming out from the ground and the stands behind it fulled with big holes. Cat Noir is then hit in the face by the Penalteam-themed soccer ball)''
'''Dider Roustan''': ''(From his yellow ball)'' Left on his own, Cat Noir seems exhausted. Penalteam's cannonballs have hurtled the feline in the cat food! It's not sport anymore, it's animal abuse!
''(Penalteam shoots the ball again at Cat Noir and scores another point. Laughing at Cat Noir, who has been been hit into the net and lays on the ground in exhaustion)''
'''Ladybug''': You didn't do so badly, kitty cat!
'''Didier Roustan''': Ladybug is back! Here's the group selected for this decisive match! Ladybug remains faithful in her classical line-up Carapace, Pegasus, Polymouse, King Monkey, Purple Tigress, Pigella, Vesperia, Viperion and Ryuko!
''(Carapace, Pegasus, Polymouse, King Monkey, Purple Tigress appear on top of the stadium. Pigella, Vesperia, Viperion, Ryuko, also appear)''
'''Didier Roustan''': But also 4 new recruits' who's names I don't know...
''(The new heroes appear one by one, starting with Miss Hound)''
'''[[Sabrina Raincomprix|Miss Hound]]''': Miss Hound!
'''[[Marc Anciel|Rooster Bold]]''': Rooster Bold!
'''[[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Caprikid]]''': Caprikid!
'''[[Ivan Bruel|Minotaurox]]''': Minotaurox!
'''Penalteam''': Blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, losers, are you done yet?
'''Cat Noir''': ''(Whispering to Ladybug)'' You got a plan for getting our paws on the akumatized object?
'''Ladybug''': That'll be our trophy when we win.
'''Cat Noir''': What if we don't?
'''Ladybug''': Come on, I know the secrets of this game!
'''Penalteam''': Let's finish this soccer game once and for all!
'''Didier Roustan''': And so begins the battle of the century between Penalteam and the Miraculous team!
''(Viperion passes the ball to Ladybug and runs alongside of her as she starts dribbling the ball. One Penalty goes in to stop Ladybug but Ladybug quickly passes to Viperion. Another Penalty slides in and tags Viperion by the ankles which puts him in a yelow, clear ball)''
'''Didier Roustan''': Impossible, injustice, treason!
'''Ladybug''': Foul!
'''Penalteam''': Not according to my rules!
'''Ladybug''': ''(Minotaurox, Rooster Bold, Ladybug and Pegasus take off on the field)'' Careful, you don't want her to touch you with her feet!
''(Penalteam dashes toward the team of heroes, one Penalteam passes the ball to another)''
'''Didier Roustan''': Penalty passes to Penalty, who passes to Penalty! What a show of incredible coordination as if they were one! Which seems to be the case! Pegasus lets Penalty pass... 
''(The Penalteam have created a square formation in their passing with the 4 heroes inside, passing to each other back and forth. Pegasus tries to get the ball but one Penalteam runs past him, toward the goal and shoots. Carapace attempts to stop it with his shield but because the kick was so powerful, he is shot into the goal, outside into the city through several buildings and in big concrete pile)''
'''Didier Roustan''': Ladybug's team seems thrown off course! ''(The yellow balls shrink once again)''
'''Penalteam''': Yahoo!
'''King Monkey''': The goal's gone, now what do we do?
'''Penalteam''': We move on to the next level, losers!
''(Penalteam snaps her fingers and the goals are transported to another location)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Arc de Triomphe]]}}
<poem>
'''Didier Roustan''': The playing field has gone from just the stadium to all of Paris! This is total soccer, like my friend Johann used to say!
''(Penalteam blows her whistle. Carapace chucks the ball in the air to Ladybug. Ladybug jumps and receives the ball with her shoulder, then slides down the [[Louvre]] with the ball. Purple Tigress is seen running ontop of the [[Louvre Palace]])''
'''Didier Roustan''': And the game resumes with a long clearance to Ladybug! Ladybug seems determined to turn this game around! Purple Tigress is in a good position...
'''Ladybug''': Purple Tigress, cover me!
'''Purple Tigress''': Huh? [[Clout]]! ''(Purple Tigress jumps off the building and activates Clout, rupturing the area with the two Penalteams. Ladybug takes the ball and continues dribbling.)
'''Didier Roustan''': Minotaurox who just came in to replace Viperion is unmarked, but Ladybug decides to go alone. (Two other Penalties try to tag Ladybug with their cleat but Ladybug hops and dodges them both, leaving the two Penalteams to collide into each other but instead they get up and steal the ball) The Penalteam seizes their chance and take back control of the ball what a shame!
'''Ladybug''': Give it back!
'''Ryuko''': ''(Appears ahead in front of the Penalteam with the ball and Ladybug)'' Stop! Ladybug, I got this! ''(Tagged by another Penalteam and captured into a yellow ball)''
'''Didier Roustan''': Ladybug will have to play more of a team game if she wants to block Penalteam's aggressive and coordinated strategy.
''(The Penalteam with the ball passes to another Penalteam over the Louvre Palace. Cat Noir and another Penalteam go head to head trying to take the ball. Then Cat Noir heads the ball into the goal scoring a point)''
'''Cat Noir''': Woo-hoo!
'''Didier Roustan''':  Cat Noir just scored an own goal! Now that's what I call a cat-tastrophe!
''(The yellow balls shrink)''
'''Cat Noir''': Huh? But I scored not her.
'''Carapace''': You scored against your own team Cat Noir! You put the ball into the Penalteam's goal!
'''Cat Noir''': Ah! Got it!
''(Carapace takes the ball and passes it up to Polymouse on top of the [[Roue de Paris]] but a Penalty steals the pass and kicks it to another Penalty, who kicks it to another Penalteam, to another and another then shoots it into the goal scoring a point. The Penalteam then proceed pass and shoot 4 more goals, which shrink the yellow balls holding the people once more. Ladybug, Polymouse, Pegasus are seen being dodged and passed by the Penalteam. Pigella is tagged by one Penalteam and goes to shoot the ball into the goal)''
'''Carapace''': [[Shell-ter]] ''(Stops the Penalteam from scoring but his shield then shatters and he is falls to the ground)''
'''Didier Roustan''': Keeping the Penalteam from scoring is a good start, but it's a long road to victory. Halftime!
''(The Penalteam clock buzzes, signifying halftime with Penalteam having 12 points and the hero team with none. The Penalteams cheer while Polymouse, Rooster Bold, Carapace, Minotaurox and Ladybug are stopping to catch their breath. They gather in as a group along with Cat Noir and Pegasus)''
'''Ladybug''': No one uses their power anymore, it's too risky if you get caught and imprisoned. Go recharge your kwamis and transform back. ''(The other heroes scatter off. Ladybug growls after looking at the score. Later the heroes return recharged, but discouraged)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(looks around them and frowns)'' I'm sorry, I've been a bad captain. I played a solo game, I forgot we're a team. I'm gonna need all of you now, more than ever.
'''Rooster Bold''': Are you sure? I'm not really..
'''Ladybug''': You're an excellent player, Rooster Bold. That's why I chose you. That's why I chose all of you! Let's play together, and bring all of our individual strengths together onto the field!
''(They come together and do a group fist bump)''
'''All''': Together!
'''Didier Roustan''': Ladybug's team is back onto the field with a 4-3-3 formation and a toughly new spirit!
''(Carapace is in goal with the ball, Vesperia and Purple Tigress set up in defense near him, Pegasus and King Monkey stand up on top of the Louvre, Miss Hound, Caprikid and Polymouse stand up on the Louvre Palace, Ladybug is positioned ontop of the [[Obélisque de Louxor]], Rooster Bold, Cat Noir and Minotaurox stand on top of the clear area of the Louvre Palace. Penalteam blows her whistle. Carapace starts off by passing it all the way to Ladybug. One Penalty tries to take the ball but Ladybug immediately passes to Polymouse. Polymouse runs and dodges three Penalties)''
'''Ladybug''': King Monkey is just ahead of you, to your right!
''(Polymouse sends the ball up to King Monkey who is running along the Louvre Palace. King Monkey jumps and dodges a Penalty and passes to Vesperia)''
'''Ladybug''': King Monkey, switch wings, on your right, to Vesperia! 
''(Vesperia comes to the ball is companied by two Penalteams, she heads the ball to Rooster Bold)'' 
'''Ladybug''': You're up, Rooster Bold! You can't score a goal if you can't take a shot!
''(Rooster Bold receives the ball with his chest, juggles it to his knee then foot, and shoots the ball into the Penalteam's goal, scoring one point)''
'''Didier Roustan''': GOAL! The change of strategy seems to be paying off! The game is smoother and better coordinated! Come on, Team Miraculous! 
''(Rooster Bold is shown scoring one point, then 3 more points are immediately scored after. Several points are also scored later by the hero team and they have tied their points with the Penalteam.)''
'''Didier Roustan''': It's a tie! With only thirty seconds left! ''(Ladybug dribbles the ball and avoids getting tagged by a Penalty by jumping over the Penalteam with the ball between her feet)''
'''Didier Roustan''': Nice rainbow flip, perfectly executed by Ladybug!
''(She passes to Minotaurox, Minotaurox receives the ball with his chest)''
'''Ladybug''': Use your power and shoot as hard as you can!
'''Minotaurox''': (Starts dribbling through the city)'' [[Resistance]]! ''(The six Penalties are blasted away after attempting to tag Ivan with their cleats)'' 
'''Didier Roustan''': Incredible! It looks like Minotaurox is now impervious to all other powers!
''(Minotaurox jumps, juggles the ball up in the air and heads the ball. Pulling in three Penalties into the goal and scoring a point, the score board shows the heros team with 13 points and the Penalteam with 12 points. The yellow balls expand more)''
'''Dider Roustan''': My friends this is more than just a miraculous comeback, it's a miraculata! Ladybug's team has won!
'''Ladybug''': I think we've earned our trophy.
'''Penalteam''': No, this is not over!
''(The goals disappear and are placed in the [[Champ de Mars]])''
'''Cat Noir''': But that's not fair!
'''Penalteam''': It's my soccer game - I can do whatever I want! I'm the villain! ''(throws a red card at Cat Noir)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''[[Cataclysm]]! (The red card is destroyed)''
''(5 Penalties surround Cat Noir and all throw red cards at him)''
'''Dider Roustan''': Cat Noir's been hit! In 5 minutes he'll transform back and reveal his secret identity, unless our heroes can get their hands on an Akuma… that's unreachable!
''(Cat Noir is placed in a yellow, transparent soccer ball upside down)''

''(The heroes line up in front of Ladybug)''
'''Ladybug''': [[Lucky Charm]]!
''(An art easel appears. Ladybug places it next to her and opens up a marker)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(to herself)'' Okay Penalteam, we'll keep playing. ''(to everyone)'' So we can't win, she'll never let us and the glasses are out of reach. The only way to end this is if Chloé rejects the Akuma herself. We'll have 5 minutes to make the Penalteam despise playing soccer so much, that she'll quit the game.
''(All the remaining heroes are drawn on the paper with arrows pointing  to 3 angry Penalties)'' 
'''Carapace''': How?
'''Ladybug''': By making her realize ''she can't win''. We'll be a team of invincible superheroes! We will use our powers indefinitely without ever transforming back!
'''Vesperia''': But that's impossible! If we use our powers, we will transform back after 5 minutes.
'''Ladybug''': True, but we can make the Penalteam believe otherwise. Thanks to Caprikid's power.
'''Caprikid''': Hmm. What we need is a magic wand. I can create any object I want, so I guess I could make a wand, but I don't have the power to make it magic.
'''Ladybug''': Also true, but Penalteam doesn't have to know that.

'''Didier Roustan''': Ladybug's 11 are in position, there are less than 4 minutes before Ladybug and Cat Noir transform back!
''(The group of heroes and the Penalteam walk toward each other to from opposite sides of the bridge with the ball between them)''
'''Penalteam''': Ready for your countdown as a superhero, Lady-Loser?
'''Ladybug''': Never claim a goal before the ball has crossed the line Penalty! ''(nods to Caprikid; he nods back)''
'''Caprikid''': [[Genesis]]! ''(Creates a wand with his power)'' Thanks to this magic wand, I'm granting you all the power to indefinitely use your powers! ''(pats Minotaurox with his wand)'' No more time limits, ''(pats Ladybug with his wand)'' no transforming back, unlimited number of use!
''(The Penalteam is shocked and outraged)''
'''Penalteam''': ''(stuttering)'' But that.. that's cheating!
'''Ladybug''': You were the one that wanted to play right? So we will, indefinitely and we're gonna love it, forever!
''(Miss Hound throws out her ball, which touches the soccer ball)''
'''Penalteam''': Hey, don't touch that!
'''Miss Hound''': Sorry, I just love ballies.
''(Penalteam blows her whistle, one Penalty begin to pass the ball to another and they head off into the heroes team. The Penalteam with the ball passes Miss Hound)''
'''Miss Hound''': [[Fetch]]!
''(The ball disappears from in front of the Penalteam)''
'''Penalteam''': What?!
''(Miss Hound retreives the ball)''
'''Ladybug''': Super! Miss Hound!
'''Rooster Bold''': ''(Miss Hound passes to Rooster Bold, Rooster Bold starts dribbling the ball)'' [[Sublimation]]!
'''Penalteam''': (laughs) Sublimation? You have the power to make yourself less ugly?
'''Rooster Bold''': Actually my power is to choose a super ability, and I choose to score a ball anytime I shoot. ''(Rooster Bold shoots the ball, with his power the ball moves around the Penalteam in the way and goes into the goal)'' And that's how it's gonna be every time I get the ball!
'''Penalty 1''': You're…lame!
'''Penalty 2''': It's not us, it was them! ''(The Penalteam goalie kicks ball out between two other Penalties)''
'''Didier Roustan''': The tension is starting to rise between the Penalteam players.
''(One Penalty runs up to the ball, Ladybug nods to Vesperia, Vesperia goes and touches a Penalty with [[Venom]], freezing the Penalteam before she could shoot)''
'''Vesperia''': Venom!
'''Didier Roustan''': There you go! A winning team is a united team. United by its diversity, a team where everyone's individualities find expression and complement each other! That's the beauty of team sports! Like my friend Arsenne said, "In soccer the important thing is not to have the eleven best, but the best eleven."
''(Vesperia takes the ball and passes to Rooster Bold, he shoots the ball into the goal again. The yellow balls grow. One Penalty tries to kick the ball but Pegasus uses [[Voyage]] and transport the ball into the goal. Rooster Bold is shown shooting the ball 4 more times after. Cat Noir, watching from inside a yellow ball, looks down excitedly but glances at his ring as it starts beeping that's he's gonna transform back)''
'''Penalteam''': So you're just gonna keep scoring everytime? That's not fair!
'''Ladybug''': Yep, and that's the way it's gonna be, forever.
'''King Monkey''': [[Uproar]]! ''(Using the power, which gives him a yellow rubber duck, he throws it at a Penalty and the rest of the Penalties' cleats turn to rubber ducks, the goals turn to a bathtub and the yellow balls holding the captured people turn to bubbles)'' 
'''Penalty''': ''(stomping around)'' But… what has this fool done?! My powers all messed up now!
'''King Monkey''': Nah, I just made it way more fun.
'''Penalty 2''': ''(All the Penalteam's cleats making squeaky noises)'' You are so useless!
'''Penalty 3''': No, you're useless!
'''Penalty 4''': You're both ridiculous! Stop going quack-quack!
'''Penalty 5''': You're the one who's going quack-quack!
'''Penalty 6''': ''(One Penalty trying to take off the rubber duck off another Penalty)'' Stop making that noise!
'''Penalty 7''': But if we can't move, we can't play!
'''Penalty''': I am done with you! I can't stand you another minute! You're all ridiculous, utterly ridiculous! ''(Penalty growls angrily and is contacted by Shadow Moth)''

'''Ladybug''': ''(captures akuma)'' No more evil-doing for your little Akuma…Time to de-evilize! Gotcha! ''(releases a white butterfly)'' Bye-bye little butterfly. ''(throws up her lucky charm)'' [[Miraculous Ladybug]]!

'''Marinette''': Miss Bustier, Mr. Didier, we've all discussed it and we all agree: Chloé shouldn't have to play if she doesn't want to.
'''Chloé''': ''(throws down her yellow jersey)'' Oh that's too kind of you Dupain-Cheng! Yuck!
'''Didier Roustan''': Hmm, we're gonna be one player short again.
'''Nathaniel''': Well, I could play. I mean, if it's okay with you?
''(The rest of the class cheers. Marc picks up the yellow jersey from the ground and hands it to Nathaniel. Chloé angrily walks pass them)''
'''Chloé''': (groans and then looks at Sabrina) What are you waiting for?!
'''Sabrina''': Please Chloé, I'd like to…
'''Chloé''': Ugh, whatever! Go play with these bunch of losers, after all you're just like them. ''(Stomps off to the bench where Lila is sitting and goes on her phone)''
'''Lila''': Welcome to the bench.
'''Chloé''': What's your name again?
'''Lila''': It's not my name that matters, but who I hate. And I think we have a lot in common on that front. ''(Chloé smirks at her)''
''(The end card shows the heroes, Polymouse, King Monkey doing a an upside down punt, Cat Noir running, Ivan, Marc, Sabrina, Nathaniel, Carapace using Shell-ter, Viperion, Ladybug looking back and grinning, Purple Tigress, Vesperia bouncing the ball, and Pegasus sliding on the ground.)''
