{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair]]. [[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]] is standing, in front of the lair's window.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]], ever since you became the guardian of the [[Miraculouses]], something has been different, and believe me I will find out exactly what it is.
''(The lair window closes shut.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Agreste mansion|The Agreste mansion's]] [[Unknown repository|repository]]. [[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel]] is in front of [[Emilie Agreste|Emilie]]'s cryogenic pod.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': Tonight, Emilie, our rings will once again be united. I've invited your [[Amelie Graham de Vanily|sister]] and [[Félix Graham de Vanily|Félix]]. I have every intention of getting back what he stole from me.
''(Gabriel wears the ring.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Inside the Graham de Vanily car. Félix is watching the Ladyblog in his tablet.}}
<poem>
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]''': ''(v.o)'' The Miraculous are magical jewels that give powers to superheroes, like [[Ladybug Miraculous|Ladybug's earrings]] and [[Cat Miraculous|Cat Noir's ring]]. But supervillain Shadow Moth also has two [[Butterfly Miraculous|Miraculous]] [[Peacock Miraculous|brooches]] in his possession, and they will give him his powers. We can figure out from this that the Miraculous can either make a superhero or a supervillain. It's all riding on who wears it, which is why these jewels can't fall into just anybody's hands. That's all for today, guys! See you soon, and stay connected!
'''Félix''': ''(puts down the tablet)'' I hope we'll get to see some superheroes while we're here in Paris, mom.
'''Amelie''': That would be pretty exciting, wouldn't it, darling? ''(gives a flying kiss)'' Mwah!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, [[Agreste mansion|The Agreste mansion]], [[Nathalie's room]]. [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] enters the room and serves [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Nathalie]] her lunch.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': Yes?
''(Adrien comes in with prepared food.)''
'''Nathalie''': Thank you, Adrien.
'''Adrien''': My father doesn't want me to invite my friends from school tonight.
'''Nathalie''': But there will be some teenagers here, like [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] and [[Kagami Tsurugi|Kagami]].
'''Adrien''': Yeah, but only 'cause their parents are members of his club.
'''Nathalie''': These club members are influential people in Paris. They are very important to your father, Adrien.
'''Adrien''': ''(sadly)'' And my friends are very important to me.
'''Gabriel''': Adrien, can you leave us for a moment?
'''Adrien''': Yes, father.
''(Adrien walks out of the room, closing the door. Gabriel sits beside Nathalie and takes off his spectacles.)''
'''Gabriel''': I'm having a difficult time without your help, Nathalie. I realized now how many people it would take to fill your shoes.
'''Nathalie''': You're not thinking about cancelling the party, are you?
'''Gabriel''': I can't, the members of the club wouldn't understand. Also, Félix will be here with Amelie.
'''Nathalie''': I've made a list of everything that has to get done tonight.
''(Nathalie hands him a tablet, while Gabriel puts on his spectacles.)''
'''Nathalie''': You'll just need to follow the instructions. The most important things are in red. ''(Gabriel scrolls through the list of instructions, on the tablet.)'' Check the staffs' identities, make sure the robots are set to the proper program and don't forget to activate the cellphone scramblers, so the party stays private.
''(Nathalie hands him a sandwich.)''
'''Nathalie''': Have you had lunch?
'''Gabriel''': No. ''(takes the sandwich)'' Thank you.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Collège Françoise Dupont]], the [[Art classroom]].}}
<poem>
'''Alya''': [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]. We've decided to ask [[Marc Anciel|Marc]] and [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Nathaniel]] for help. If anyone can come up with the perfect plan for you to finally tell Adrien you love him, it's them.
'''Marinette''': What? Are you serious?
'''Alya''': Yeah, so?
'''Marinette''': So they all know about me and... ''(whispers)'' how I feel about you know who?
'''[[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]]''': Everyone knows that you're crushing on Adrien!
'''Marinette''': Even Adrien?
'''Nathaniel''': Adrien is probably the only one who doesn't know.
'''Marc''': Of course, otherwise there would be no story.
'''Alya''': We chose Marc and Nate, 'cause as you know, they're the experts in romantic comedies. Marc writes and Nate draws.
'''[[Rose Lavillant|Rose]]''': And, since they succeeded in inventing a love story for Ladybug and Cat Noir in their first comic book, they're sure to think of the perfect plot between you and Adrien!
'''Marc''': Your story with Adrien seems really complicated.
'''Nathaniel''': But it's actually very simple.
'''Marc''': It's just like a fairy tale. Nate?
''(Nathaniel opens a book.)''
'''Marc''': Usually, a mean old witch imprisons a princess in a castle guarded by a dragon. And a knight in shining armour has to save her. Well, this is the same story, except you're the knight, Marinette, Adrien's the princess, the castle is his home, and the witch is his father, Gabriel Agreste.
'''Rose''': I'd have thought his father was the king.
'''[[Alix Kubdel|Alix]]''': Or the dragon.
'''[[Zoé Lee|Zoé]]''': [[Adrien's bodyguard|His bodyguard]] would be the dragon, he looks the part!
'''Mylène''': He looks more like a gorilla.
''(Everyone laughs.)''
'''Nathaniel''': The main obstacle in the fairy tale could be the dragon.
'''Marc''': Or the witch! In Marinette and Adrien's story, it's Gabriel Agreste. But the witch Agreste has made a mistake! He's been letting his son out of the castle to go to school!
'''Alya''': And that's where the good fairies come in!
'''Marc and Nathaniel''': Us!
'''Marc''': Every week, we'll think of a new plan, so that the knight can finally kiss the princess! And they can finally live happily ever after with buckets of hamsters! And the plan will always take place in the one and only location where the witch can't get to, which is...
'''Marinette''': The school!
''([[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] enters through a ceiling tile.)''
'''Chloé''': A-ha! You forgot me in your ridiculous fairy tale!
''([[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]] follows her, falling down flat on her face instead.)''
'''Rose''': ''(screams)'' The terrifying ogre!
'''Mylène''': The big bad wolf!
'''Alix''': The ugly toad!
'''Chloé''': Your worst nightmare!
''(Chloé then shows her cellphone to them with a recording of the meeting playing.)''
'''Chloé''': Thanks to this video, I'm going to ruin Dupain-Cheng's fairy tale! Tonight, I'll show this video to his father, who will realize that you're trying to take his son away from him and make him fall in love with a baker girl! Then he'll lock Adrien up in his room forever and forbid him to come back to school, and poof! There goes your fairy tale! Adrien will never see you again! Good for him!
'''Marinette''': I thought you're happy that Adrien was coming to school?
'''Chloé''': He'll be better off alone at home than surrounded by a bunch of lame-o's at school! And then maybe he'll be lucky enough to go back to being my Prince Charming whom I've always adored!
'''Marinette''': Adrien was never your Prince Charming, Chloé!
'''Chloé''': We'll see about that, Dupain-Cheng! Sabrina, ninja smokescreen!
''(Sabrina throws a white powder before making their escape. Chloé hits the ceiling.)''
'''Marinette''': She won't do anything. Not tonight, or ever. The witch— I mean, Gabriel Agreste, doesn't just let anyone walk into his house.
'''Zoé''': Normally, that's true, but actually, there's a dinner party tonight, and all his friends are invited, with their children! Chloé will be there.
'''Marinette''': Yeah, but so will [[Audrey Bourgeois|her mother]], who's your mother, so you'll be there too! You'll be able to stop her, right?
'''Zoé''': My darling half sister Chloé managed to convince her mother not to bring me with them.
'''Marinette''': ''(groans)'' She really is a piece of work...
'''Marc''': We just have to pretend like we're in a fairy tale! The knight simply has to go to the ball to stop the evil Chloé from showing the videos to the witch Agreste!
'''Zoé''': The knight can't get into the ball. The ball is off-limits, tonight.
''(Nathaniel is drawing over the book.)''
'''Marc''': Unless, the knight is wearing...
'''Nathaniel''': ''(He shows his drawn-on illustration)'' A disguise!

{{Scene|Scene: [[Le Grand Paris]]. [[Butler Jean]] is pushing a tray of crockeries. Zoé is sitting on the sofa. As Butler Jean comes out, she gets ready and stands up.}}
<poem>
'''Zoé''': ''(rudely)'' Jean Quinton, did my mother tell you that the dinner party is no longer at Gabriel Agreste's tonight?
'''Butler Jean''': Oh no! Madam didn't mention anything to me.
'''Zoé''': A helicopter will be coming to the roof, to take you over to the Eiffel Tower.
'''Butler Jean''': Is mademoiselle sure about this?
'''Zoé''': Excuse me? Are you suggesting that I might be wrong? ''(walks away)'' Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous! ''(to herself)'' Sorry, but it's for a good cause.   
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, the Dupain-Cheng residence, [[Marinette's room]].}}
<poem>
'''Zoé''': ''(Through the phone)'' The butler is out of the picture.
'''Marc''': The knight can take his place!
''(Marinette's friend help her to get in the disguise of the butler.)''
'''Rose''': ''(Placing mustache on Marinette's face)'' There, perfect!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, the Agreste mansion.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': ''(Locks his office.)'' Office locked, check.
''(Gabriel closes the curtains.)''
'''Gabriel''': Dining room, check. Accessories, check.
''(A van arrives outside the mansion.)''
'''Gabriel''': Catering, check. Activate scrambler...
''(The doorbell rings. Adrien's bodyguard goes to the door, but Gabriel interrupts him.)''
'''Gabriel''': You handle the cellphone scrambler, I'll take care of greeting my guests.
''(Adrien's bodyguard goes to the table full of remotes, and presses a remote button, due to which all the window shutters starts to get open and close automatically. He presses another button due to which robots come out and start circling the bodyguard. He presses another button, due to which everything becomes normal.)''
'''Gabriel''': Welcome.
''(The guests scan their fingerprints onto Gabriel's tablet, and wear the provided masks.)''
'''Marinette''': [[Sarah|Waitress]] in sight.
'''Zoé''': ''(in Marinette's room, through the phone)'' Good luck, Marinette.
'''Marinette''': ''(coughs)'' ''(in a fake accent)'' Hi there.
'''Sarah''': Uh...
'''Marinette''': I'm Marino. ''(bows)'' Sorry I'm late, they let me know at the last minute that I had to take over for the regular waiter 'cause... he's sick!
'''Sarah''': Oh! Nice to meet you. My name is Sarah. Here's the deal, this is a very private party with very important people! We have to be invisible. The only contact we'll have with Gabriel Agreste will be when he takes our fingerprints to check our identities.
'''Marinette''': Ah— uh... check our identities?
'''Rose''': ''(in Marinette's room, through the phone)'' Was this part of the plan?
'''Sarah''': We're just here for food prep in the kitchen and overseeing the children. The robots will be serving the adults. Follow me, everything will be fine.
'''Marinette''': I've got the muscles, I'll carry the heavy stuff. Don't you worry, partner!
''(Marinette takes the heavy box from Sarah and walks towards the mansion.)''
'''Gabriel''': Thank you.
''(Sarah enters the mansion and gets her fingers scanned, but due to Marinette's hands being full with the heavy box, Gabriel doesn't bother to scan her fingerprint and thus, passes the security check.)''
'''Marinette''': I'm in!
'''Zoé''': ''(in Marinette's room, through the phone)'' Yes, well done!
'''Audrey''': How come you're doing all the work tonight, Gabriel? If you needed more servants, you just have to ask us to lend you more.
'''Gabriel''': Welcoming you is never work, dear Audrey.
''(Gabriel leans to kiss Audrey's hand but Chloé stops him.)''
'''Chloé''': ''(waving her hand)'' Mr. Agreste, I need you to show you a video, it's really important that you see this!
'''Marinette''': Woaah! Oh no!
''(Marinette throws the package while Adrien catches it. Chloé tries to dodge the package but bumps into Gabriel, breaking both the tablet and the cellphone.)''
'''Chloé''': My phone!
''(Adrien hands over the package to Marinette.)''
'''Adrien''': I guess you dropped this.
'''Marinette''': Thanks— ''(in a fake accent)'' Oh— I mean, thanks.
'''Adrien''': Do I know you?
'''Marinette''': Not likely, I don't know anyone.
''(Marinette walks away. Amelie and Félix are heading toward the entrance. Gabriel adjusts his scarf to hide the brooches, but Félix notices it anyway.)''
'''Chloé''': Hey! You have to watch this, are you ready?
'''Gabriel''': I don't have time for this, young lady.
'''Chloé''': But—
'''[[André Bourgeois|André]]''': Come along now, sweetheart. Gabriel is obviously busy.
'''Amelie''': Gabriel! I'm so happy to be able to thank you in person for giving our family's ring ''(kisses his cheeks)'' back to Félix.
'''Gabriel''': It was the sensible thing to do, Amelie.
'''Adrien''': That was very thoughtful of you, Father.
''(Sarah clears her throat to get Marinette's attention.)''
'''Marinette''': I can handle serving the youngsters, I've always been good with kids.
'''Sarah''': I'd rather you stay in the kitchen.
'''Zoé''': ''(in communicator)'' Show her she's making the wrong choice, Marinette!
''(Marinette enters the kitchen. She crashes onto a number of objects.)''
'''Marinette''': Oh, no! I'm so clumsy!
'''Sarah''': Okay, you take care of the kids.
''(Marinette comes out of the kitchen with a tray of drinks.)''
'''Chloé''': Oh look, it's the fake Adrien! If I was anyone, other than Chloé Bourgeois, you might actually have me fooled!
'''Félix''': ''(imitating Adrien)'' You're wrong, Chloé, I ''am'' Adrien!
'''Chloé''': ''(thinking he is Adrien)'' Oh! I'm so sorry, Adrikins!
'''Félix''': ''(laughs)'' You're still just as foolish as ever, Chloé Bourgeois.
''(Félix walks away and Chloé gets angry at him. Adrien closes the door as Kagami and her mother arrives. Gabriel locks the door from his tablet.)''
'''Chloé''': Mr. Agreste! Is now good? Do you have time to look at my film?
'''Gabriel''': All cellphones will be secured safely for the duration of the evening.
''(The robot glides in front of Chloé, and opens its tray.)''
'''Gabriel''': I'm sure you understand how essential privacy is when important business is on the line.
''(Chloé takes out the memory card before inserting her phone into the robot's tray. Gabriel turns on the cellphone scrambler, which interferes with Marinette's communicator. Marinette removes the communicator.)''

'''Gabriel''': Adrien, show your young friends up to your room.
'''Adrien''': Yes, father.
''(Félix also starts to go along with them buts Gabriel stops him.)''
'''Gabriel''': Félix. May I see you for a moment?
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Gabriel's atelier. Gabriel and Félix enter the room and Gabriel shuts the door.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': Why did you steal my ring, Félix?
'''Félix''': Mom really wanted me to have it since it belonged to her family. ''(taking off the ring)'' But you really wanted to keep it, so I planned on giving it back to you tonight.
'''Gabriel''': ''(taking the ring from Félix)'' Hmm. Your mother will be sad if you do that.
'''Félix''': Don't worry, uncle. ''(wearing another ring)'' She won't know. I had a copy made.
'''Gabriel''': You're an intelligent young man, Félix.
''(Félix exits the room and goes to the staircase, smiling mischievously and takes the left staircase. Meanwhile, Gabriel comes out of the room and takes the right staircase and enters Nathalie's room. Félix follows him and stands outside the room, eavesdropping on their conversation.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, the Agreste mansion, Nathalie's room.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': I know each and every scratch on Emilie's ring! It's a fake ring! ''(angrily throws the ring)'' He gave me a fake ring! How dare he?!
''(Outside the room, Adrien calls Félix.)''
'''Adrien''': ''(outside the room, waving)'' Hey, Félix! Are you coming?
''(Félix leaves the place, waving back, and goes with Adrien.)''
'''Nathalie''': Akumatize him, then make him tell you where he's put Emilie's real ring and get it back.
'''Gabriel''': If I do that, he'll know that I'm Shadow Moth. ''(punches the table)'' Who else would want that ring?
'''Nathalie''': You're forgetting how immense your powers are now. You can be the Gabriel who creates negative emotions and the Shadow Moth who [[Akumatization|akumatizes]] them at the same time.
'''Gabriel''': Brilliant idea, Nathalie.
''(He removes his glasses and places it on the table. He takes off his scarf to transform.)''
'''Gabriel''': [[Duusu]], [[Nooroo]], dual metamorphosis!
''(He transforms into Shadow Moth and takes a feather out of his [[Hand Fan]].)'' 
'''Shadow Moth''': No one tricks Gabriel Agreste. But you, my lovely amok, you will deceive that arrogant young Félix! And thanks to you, I will get my ring back!
''(He [[Amokization|amokizes]] his glasses and forms a [[Gabriel Agreste (sentimonster)|sentimonster version of himself]].)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(Looks at the sentimonster)'' You're perfect!

'''Chloé''': ''(showing her mobile memory card)'' I need to find a phone. He has to watch my movie.
'''Adrien''': ''(stopping Chloé)'' Chloé, you heard my father. Not during the party.
'''Chloé''': He will thank me when he sees what I filmed.
'''Adrien''': Chloé, No!
''(Chloé walks away and Marinette tries to follow Chloé.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(handing the tray of drinks to Adrien)'' I will take care of it. I've always been good with young people.
''(Félix sees this and also tries to get out of the room.)''
'''Félix''': ''(standing up)'' I need to speak to my mother.
''(Félix walks out of the room. Adrien then offers Kagami some juice, to which Kagami still seems to be grumpy and Adrien smiles slightly.)''

<poem>
'''Sarah''': ''(from the kitchen)'' Marino, why do you have a cardboard box on your head?

<poem>
'''Sentimonster Gabriel''': ''(from behind Félix)'' What are you looking for, Félix?
'''Félix''': ''(turning around)'' You. I'd like to get to know you better, uncle.
'''Sentimonster Gabriel''': It's true. You don't know me very well at all, otherwise you wouldn't have given me a fake ring. Where did you put the real ring? The one that belongs to my wife?
'''Félix''': In a safe place.
'''Sentimonster Gabriel''': Wherever it is, you're going to give it back to me.
'''Félix''': How do you plan to make me do that, by using your powers... ''Shadow Moth?''
'''Sentimonster Gabriel''': I am Gabriel Agreste, and I do indeed have every power I need to find my wife's ring, including the power to destroy your life. I don't need to be ''Shadow Moth'' for that.
'''Félix''': I knew you were no ordinary uncle.
'''Sentimonster Gabriel''': ''(preparing to snap his fingers)'' And now you know that I only need to snap my fingers to make you disappear from here.
'''Félix''': You wouldn't dare!
'''Sentimonster Gabriel''': Do you want to take that risk, Félix? Think of your mother.
''(Félix backs up to Emilie's portrait. Then, an [[akuma]] enters the room and enters into the Félix's ring.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from Nathalie's room)'' Félix, I am Shadow Moth. You've put yourself in an unfortunate situation by trying to defy someone stronger than you. But I can give you the power to escape Gabriel Agreste. All I ask in return are Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.
'''Félix''': This is impossible! I'm not mistaken. You are wearing a Miraculous. Those jewels are underneath your scarf, the brooches!
'''Sentimonster Gabriel''': Brooches? What are you talking about?
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from Nathalie's room)'' You really think that Gabriel Agreste could be Shadow Moth? ''(laughs)'' He doesn't have what it takes! And neither do you. Accept the power I'm offering you!
'''Félix''': I'm not afraid of your threats, and I don't need your power!
''(Félix breaks through Shadow Moth's akumatization and an akuma flies out of his ring. He takes a button from his shirt and slides beside Sentimonster Gabriel, and while sliding, Félix makes a small tear in Sentimonster Gabriel's pants near the shoe, and runs out of the room.)''
'''Sentimonster Gabriel''': Come back!
''(After going out of the room, he closes the door and throws a chair, to block the door and runs away.)''

''(Chloé inserts the memory card inside Bob Roth's phone, when suddenly the atelier's doors fly away, revealing the Collector.)''
'''Collector''': I am now the Collector, and anyone caught in my tablet will give up their secrets to me!
''(He throws his tablet and captures Chloé.)''
'''Bob Roth''': My phone!
'''Chloé''': ''(from inside the tablet)'' I just wanted to show you this video to hurt the baker girl and keep Adrikins all to myself, because I'm a mean person. ''(gasps)'' Why did I say that?
'''Collector''': ''(pointing to Marinette)'' And you! What were you doing in the living room reserved for the members of my club? What secrets are you hiding?

'''Cat Noir''': Hey M'Lady! Looks like the Collector is gone high tech.
'''Ladybug''': I liked it better when he had a book. At least you had a limited number of pages.
'''Cat Noir''': ''(pulling Félix)'' I will get him out of here.
''(Félix gets on the back of Cat Noir and goes out of the fighting place.)''
'''Cat Noir''': What do you got that Collector wants it so badly?
'''Félix''': My ring.
'''Cat Noir''': If it's yours, why would he want to take it from you?
'''Félix''': I don't know. My uncle is a strange man.
''(The statue, whose behind they were hiding, gets absorbed by the tablet.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(seeing the statue being absorbed)'' Whoa! I hope that statue takes up a lot of memory.
'''Ladybug''': That's right! The memory on that tablet is going to fill up pretty fast!
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir successfully dodges the attacks of the Collector, due to which many other objects get absorbed by the tablet. Cat Noir takes Félix to a safe place.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Stay here Félix.
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir continue to dodge the tablet but the tablet doesn't stop to absorb things.)''
'''Ladybug''': -or not. [[Lucky Charm]]!
''(Ladybug summons Lucky Charm and gets a [[List of Lucky Charm objects#Season 4|trampoline]].)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(seeing the trampoline)'' Way to bounce back, m'Lady.
''(Through her Lucky Vision, Ladybug sees a set of plates, Cat Noir's [[Staff]], traffic lights and roadside posts.)''
'''Ladybug''': Want to help me to set up the table, kitty cat? ''(she throws the trampoline towards the traffic light pole so that the trampoline leans along with it.)''
'''Cat Noir''': So, what's for dinner?
'''Ladybug''': A Collector!
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir begin to throw plates to the Collector, to which he successfully dodges and absorbs some of the plates, with his tablet.)''
'''Collector''': My appetite is insatiable! You will fall before me!
'''Ladybug''': Cat Noir! Time for a rebound.
''(Cat Noir throws his Staff towards the Collector, who dodges the Staff but the Staff bounces off many objects and trampoline, comes from behind the Collector and hits his tablet, which falls on the ground.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(catching back his staff)'' Dinner's ready!
'''Collector''': ''Nooooo!''
''(Ladybug breaks the tablet with her Yo-yo and Akuma flies out of it.)''
'''Ladybug:''' No more evil doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilize! ''(She captures the Akuma and purifies it.)'' Gotcha! Bye-bye, little butterfly. [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]!
''(Everything absorbed by the tablet, is returned to its original place and the Collector converted back into Sentimonster Gabriel.)''
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir''': Pound it!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(speaking through Sentimonster Gabriel)'' I'm so sorry. The memory of my wife made me vulnerable. That ring was all I had left of her but you can keep it, of course! After all, I did give it to you.
''(Félix takes the ring and smiles. Ladybug produces a [[Magical Charms]] and give it to Sentimonster Gabriel.)''
'''Ladybug''': Keep this magical charm with you. It may not heal your pain but it will keep Shadow Moth from using it against you.
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(speaking through Sentimonster Gabriel)'' Thank you, Ladybug. You can't imagine how much this means to me.
'''Chloé''': Mr. Agreste! Mr. Agreste! Now you have to watch my video!
'''Bob Roth''': Hang on there a minute, young lady! That's my phone.
'''Chloé''': And it's ''my'' video.
'''Bob Roth''': Oh yeah? ''(deletes the video)'' There. Deleted!
'''Chloé''': No... Nooooooo!
'''Bob Roth''': Now it's only my phone. Have a nice rest of the evening, everyone!
