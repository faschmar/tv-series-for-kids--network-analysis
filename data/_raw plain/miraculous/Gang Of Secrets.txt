{{Scene|Scene: At a top of a building. [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] land on the building after finishing a battle while the Miraculous Ladybug power is launched.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' Wow, you are on fire, bugaboo. We never beat villains so fast. Pound it! ''(Cat Noir realizes that Ladybug is acting differently)'' Bugaboo? Something wrong?
'''Ladybug:''' ''(nervously)'' Uh, pound it - yeah. Hey, why don't we check one more time that everything's okay in Paris? ''(uses her yo-yo to perch herself to the top of the building)'' Like, an extra patrol?
'''Cat Noir:''' You wanna tell me what's going on? You didn't even scold me when I called you bugaboo.
'''Ladybug:''' There's nothing going on, everything is super great. I just have some extra time and I really don't feel like chit-chatting.
''(Cat Noir joins Ladybug into the top of the building)''
'''Cat Noir:''' Then I know the perfect place when there's no talking.
'''Ladybug:''' I'm all in!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: At the theater.}}
<poem>
''(It turns out that Cat Noir have taken Ladybug to watch movie with him. While he enjoys, Ladybug looks very displeased.)''
'''Movie:''' Oh, my darling. Why can't you love me? 
'''Ladybug:''' ''(quietly, but infuriated)'' You tricked me.
'''Cat Noir:''' Shh. No talking, you said.
'''Civilian:''' That's Ladybug and Cat Noir!
'''Movie:''' I'm keeping too many secrets from you Ronaldo, stop giving me those puppy eyes, okay? I'll tell you everything. I'm leading a double life Ronaldo. ''(The civilians look at Ladybug and Cat Noir. Cat Noir waves at them and shushes at them. The civilians smile as they return watching the movie. Cat Noir tries to place his arm around Ladybug, but Ladybug stands up, right when it happens and explodes in total fury.)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(to the movie; furious)'' Are you kidding me? Don't tell him anything, you fool!
'''Cat Noir:''' Could you keep it down, m'lady?
''(Ladybug then rants on the movie, and Cat Noir listens to the rant in a shocked manner.)''
'''Ladybug:'''  Romantic comedies are lame anyway, and you know why? It's totally not realistic! In real-life, the girl would take forever to tell the guy she loves him without stuttering. Bla-bla-bla! So how can see she know if he loves her back? It's impossible, so then she decides she can never ever be with him, and then BAM! She falls in love with another guy, and everything is so cool. Almost too easy, no stuttering, they hold hands, they get all kissy-kissy, and then, SURPRISE! She has secrets! And him, he hates secrets, of course. So as they break up, and everyone lives un-happily ever after, the end. And that's why romantic comedies are so lame. ''(Ladybug gets her drink)''
''(Cat Noir notices the civilians' reaction to the rant and they're very upset. Fearful, Cat Noir decides to leave right away to not cause any extra issues.)''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(whispering)'' So sorry, we'll be going now. ''(pushes Ladybug as they leave)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Ladybug and Cat Noir leave the theater, while Ladybug continues ranting on.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug:''' Stay AWAY from the romantic comedy, go for heroic heroes instead. Special effects, heroes saving the world, no feelings, no questions, nobody talks because there is NOTHING to say! That is good entertainment for sure.
''(Cat Noir is again shocked by the rant, while the civilians in the queue are shocked).''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(laughs nervously)'' Sorry! ''(runs quickly to Ladybug)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outside the theater.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' Listen m'lady, I didn't get everything you said and obviously, I know nothing about your private life, but I do know what heartbreak sounds and feels like, and-
'''Ladybug:''' Heartbreak? Me? ''(laughs nervously)'' That is not it at all, everything's fine. In fact, I feel like swimming, let's go to the pool! ''(prepares her yo-yo to transport herself to the swimming pool)''
'''Cat Noir: ''' You know, if you ever want to talk about anything, I'm here for you.
'''Ladybug:''' SWIMMING! Woo-hoo!
''(Ladybug goes to the pool off-screen, while Cat Noir feels unhappy about Ladybug.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. Aquabug lies down on the bed, crying.}}
<poem>
''([[Ziggy]] and [[Barkk]] notices Aquabug and decides to comfort her. Aquabug looks at the pictures of Adrien, Luka, and her friends, struggling with the feelings of heartbreak and lying.)''
'''Ziggy:''' It's so sad!
'''Barkk:''' I told you we should've taken those photos down! 
''(Barkk and Ziggy start to take the photos down, but Marinette stops them.)''
'''Aquabug:''' Stop, I'm not sad and these photos don't bother me, at all. They're just shots of fashion and friends, and I love fashion and I love my friends, so it's all good. ''(struggles with her emotions)'' There's no problem, see?
''(Barrk and Ziggy leaves Marinette.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Alya's room]].}}
<poem>
''(Alya uses her tablet to show moments regarding Marinette's love to Adrien, and then Luka).''
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]:''' So, Marinette's got a problem. Her heart's been broken. At first Marinette is crazy about Adrien but she's never been able to tell him about her feelings because well.. she's Marinette and he's.. well.. Adrien. Then comes along Luka, Marinette can talk to him because he's.. well.. Luka. So they start dating.
'''[[Rose Lavillant|Rose]]:''' They were so cute together!
'''Alya:''' Yeah, except they broke up.
'''[[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]]:''' He was like super sad when they did.
''(The group sighs sadly.)''
'''Alya:''' But the real problem here is that Marinette never told us anything. If Luka hadn't told Juleka, who told Rose, who told [[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]], who then told Alix, who finally told me. Then I, her BF in the whole world would still be in the dark! Yesterday I was in the restroom and I heard her crying.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Restroom|The restroom.]]}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' ''(crying)''
'''Alya:''' Marinette? Have you been crying?
'''Marinette:''' ''(whilst faking the emotion)'' Me? Crying? Are you kidding? I'm super happy! Let's celebrate and have a party! I'm so happy!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Alya’s room.}}
<poem>
'''Rose:''' Why is she keeping all these secrets from us? 
'''Alix:''' If she's not even telling Alya, then there's a real problem!
'''Mylène:''' What do we do? 
'''Alya:''' What Marinette needs is a friendly intervention. Let's all call her up together and see how she's doing. 
'''Girls:''' Rabbit check! ''(whistle)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room.}}
<poem>
''(Marinette's phone is ringing, but she doesn't pick up.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Alya's room.}}
<poem>
'''Alya:''' She's not picking up.
'''Marinette:''' ''(over voicemail)'' It's Marinette, leave a message, beep! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room.}}
<poem>
''(Aquabug answers the voicemail.)''
'''Alya:''' ''(over phone)'' Hey Marinette, it's us! 
'''Girls:''' ''(over phone, enthusiastically'' say ''hi to Marinette)''
'''Alya:''' ''(over phone)'' We were just calling to tell you that we're here if you need to talk, whenever you want, wherever you want, call us back!
'''Girls:''' ''(over phone)'' We love you, big hugs!
''(Aquabug stills struggles with her emotions while multiple kwamis fly over her.)''
'''Barkk:''' We gotta do something! 
'''[[Wayzz]]:''' We need Tikki! 
'''[[Trixx]]:''' I got this! Why aren't you using the talking light box to speak to your friends? 
'''Aquabug:''' About what? Everything's fine.
'''Trixx:''' Don't you think you should detransform then? 
'''Aquabug:''' No, I'm better off like this, if Shadow Moth attacks Paris, I'll already be ready for action at any time.
'''Trixx:''' Yes, but what about Tikki? She might need to rest a bit, or maybe eat something.
'''Aquabug:''' ''(frantically)'' Oh no! Tikki, spots off! ''(Aquabug de-transforms into Marinette)''
'''Marinette:''' ''(with tears on her eyes)'' Are you okay Tikki? 
'''[[Tikki]]:''' Better than you, Marinette. We should have a little talk. 
''(Marinette looks down, still tearful and heartbroken.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Alya’s room}}
<poem>
'''Alya:''' Maybe we should go to her house. What do you think? 
'''Mylène:''' We'll give her an eternal friendship bracelet so she never forgets that friends can tell each other anything and that we'll always be there for her. 
''(Mylène gives one bead for each group member)''
'''Mylène:''' I read in a magazine that an ancient South American tribe did something like this. You tell a secret to the bead in your mind, once Marinette adds her secret to the bead this bracelet will unite us all forever. Ready?
'''Alix:''' Seriously, wouldn't it be more logical to take her out for a smoothie and help her work out her love problems? 
''(The group reacts to the idea badly)''
'''Alix:''' Okay.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette’s room.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' As long as I'm Ladybug, I can't have loved ones in my life.
'''Tikki:''' What makes you say that Marinette? 
'''Marinette:''' You know why. I had to break up with Luka because I couldn't tell him the truth, it'd be the same thing with Adrien. I can't share my secret with either of them. I can't be honest with my closest friends or my parents about anything. I'm doomed to be a big liar to everyone, forever. What do I do Tikki? 
'''Tikki:''' I wish I could tell you but... kwamis don't fall in love.
'''Marinette:''' You see? No one can help me. My life as Marinette is too complicated. I should just be Ladybug ''all'' the time! Tikki, spots on! ''(Marinette transforms into Ladybug.)''
'''Alya:''' Marinette? Marinette? 
''(The kwamis hide into the Miracle Box).''
'''Rose:''' ''(realising the house)'' Wow! Check this out girls! This is new! Oh, it's so cute!
'''Mylène:''' Another one of Marinette's cool creations.
'''Alya:''' She must be up on the patio, I'll go get her.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's balcony]].}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug:''' What are ''you'' waiting for, Shadow Moth?!''' Here I am! '''
''(Ladybug decides to go back into her room.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette’s room.}}
<poem>
'''Alya:''' Marinette? 
'''Ladybug:''' ''(gasps)'' Spots off. 
'''Alya:''' Marinette! 
'''Marinette:''' What are you doing here? 
'''Alya:''' We're just checkin' in on you, girl. 
'''Rose:''' Aw, it looks just like a real house, look how the roof comes off to show the inside!
'''Marinette:''' ''(frantically)'' No! No, don't touch that! Move away! 
''(As Rose opens the roof, Marinette gets down, pushing past through her friends and Rose as she hides what is inside of the dollhouse, while Rose accidentally drops the roof, which cracks. The girls gasp in shock.)''
'''Rose:''' ''(kneels to pick up the cracks)'' Sorry, Marinette! 
'''Marinette:''' ''(angrily)'' Will you please leave my room?! 
'''Alya:''' Chill out Marinette, it's just a doll house. We'll totally help. 
'''Marinette:''' No you won't, please go!
'''Alya:''' Okay Marinette, there's clearly something wrong and we're not leaving you like this till you tell us what it is.
'''Mylène:''' Each of us told our secrets to this bracelet. It's your turn now.
'''Marinette:''' ''(angrily)'' The only thing that's wrong right now is you guys still hanging out in my room, which is not cool!
'''Alya:''' If we're really your friends, you can confide in us.
'''Rose:''' Real friends don't ever let each other down. 
'''Marinette:''' ''(lashes out at them in rage)'' Well then maybe I don't want you to be my friends, '''GET OUT!'''
''(The group of friends are shocked and heartbroken by this, and exit her room right away. Alya looks at Marinette one more time before finally leaving in sadness. Once they're gone, Marinette drops to her knees and cries, shattered over what she has done.)''
'''Marinette:''' ''(struggling with her emotions)'' I had no choice Tikki, I had to do it. 
'''Tikki:''' ''(sadly)'' I know, Marinette.
'''Marinette:''' At least now I won't have to lie anymore, since, there'll be no one to lie to.

''(The group of friends leave sadly. Tom and Sabine are working and notice them, but Sabine realizes their emotions.)''
'''[[Sabine Cheng|Sabine]]:''' Is everything okay? Girls? 
''(Alya, Rose, Juleka, Mylène and Alix leave and are outside, heartbroken over what happened.)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair]]. Shadow Moth senses of how much the girls are saddened with Marinette for not telling them her secrets and breaking their friendship.}}
<poem>
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]]:''' Several fragile hearts that break all at the same time. What a lovely symphony for my akumas. ''(creates the akuma)'' Fly away my akuma, and evilize them! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Place des Vosges]]}}
<poem>
''(The bracelet is passed to each friend before the akumatization, all in a sad mood.)''
'''Alya:''' ''(heartbroken)'' I just lost my best friend. 
'''Mylène:''' ''(deeply hurt)'' I really thought it would work.
'''Rose:''' ''(crying)'' This is so sad!
'''Juleka:''' ''(mumbling sadly)''
'''Alix:''' ''(both sad and angry)'' This cannot end like this!
''(Alix crushes bracelet in anger and sadness. The akuma enters the bracelet, and Alya, Mylène, Rose, Juleka and Alix are all akumatized. There's a five-split scene, where in front of the girls appear purple butterflies.)''
'''Shadow Moth:''' ''(from his lair)'' Gang of Secrets, I am Shadow Moth. Your friend won't reveal her secrets to you? I will give you all the powers you need to force her to give them up! All that I want in exchange are Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous. 
'''Alya:''' Marinette will stay our friend. 
'''Alix:''' Whether she wants to or not.
'''Mylène:''' And she'll keep no secrets from us.
'''Juleka:''' ''(mumbling)'' Can't believe she'd do that.
''(All five get transformed to their previous akumatized forms.)''
'''Lady Wifi:''' I'll be in charge of capturing her.
'''Princess Fragrance:''' I will force her to reveal what she's been hiding from us. 
'''Timebreaker:''' ''(enthusiastically)'' And I'll turn back time to return everything to the way it was.
'''Reflekta:''' We'll comfort her and she'll be our friend again.
'''Lady Wifi:''' And if Ladybug and Cat Noir try to stand in our way, Horrificator will keep them busy! 
''(Horrificator roars as the Gang of Secrets are on their way to go after Marinette.)''

<poem>
''(Marinette throws away the mess that was made in the event, and has created a storage box for where the Miracle Box will be held. Marinette closes her eyes and sighs in relief. Lady Wifi teleports to her phone, startling her.)''
'''Lady Wifi:''' ''(to Marinette; optimistically)'' I'm here for you Marinette, I'm your friend. ''(menacingly)'' You will tell us all your secrets and you will feel so much better! 
''(Trixx, Wayzz and Barkk all transport themselves to the storage box.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The storage box.}}
<poem>
''(Trixx prepares his power.)''
'''Wayzz:''' You really shouldn't be doing this, Trixx!
'''Barkk:''' ''(frantically)'' Remember the last time you used your power of Illusion without a holder?
'''Trixx:''' ''(determined)'' Marinette must not reveal her secret. Mirage!

''(Lady Wifi looks around for Marinette, who is nowhere to be seen. She eventually sees Trixx's illusion of Marinette running towards [[Collège Françoise Dupont]], which bewilders her.)''

</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Collège Françoise Dupont's entrance.}}

'''Lady Wifi:''' Don't run away Marinette, we're friends aren't we? ''(The other 4 members of the Gang follow.)'' Follow me.

''(The real Marinette reappears.)''
'''Marinette:''' Thanks Trixx.

''(Ladybug prepares to go to the balcony but is stopped by a thought)''
'''Ladybug:''' When a kwami uses their power without a holder to channel its energy, doesn't it often set off some kind of catastrophe? 
'''Trixx:''' My power creates Illusions, ''(Wayzz and Barkk look shocked with their mouths open)'' so the side effects will hopefully just be in their imaginations. 
''(Ladybug goes to the balcony, while Wayzz and Barkk are annoyed by his recent action.)''
'''Trixx:''' Oh come on, her Miraculous Ladybug will make everything alright anyway. ''(his expression droops)'' I hope.

<poem>
'''Nadja Chamack:''' ''(on TV)'' A strange phenomenon has just hit the Eiffel Tower. We advise all Parisians to stay home… ''(continues in background)''
'''[[Plagg]]:''' I'll bet you an entire Camembert that this is Trixx's doing.
'''Adrien:''' Trixx? 
'''Plagg:''' The kwami of Illusion. 
'''Adrien:''' What's not an illusion is the fact that Ladybug needs our help!
'''Plagg:''' Great. Even when I'm not the one who made the mess, I still have to help clean it up.
'''Adrien:''' Plagg, claws out!

''(Princess Fragrance and Reflekta enter.)''
'''Princess Fragrance:''' Has anyone seen Marinette Dupain-Cheng? 
'''Students and [[Jean-Pierre Monlataing]]:''' Huh? ''(all of theme shake their heads)''
'''Princess Fragrance:''' Then you're gonna help us find her! 
''(Reflekta uses her power on the students, while Princess Fragrance spews her perfume to them. The victims cough, and once the perfume disappears they all become obedient clones of Reflekta.)''
'''Students and [[Jean-Pierre Monlataing]]:''' At your service, Princess Fragrance.

'''Cat Noir:''' Hey there, m'lady. Somebody is having a super villain party and didn't invite us.
'''Ladybug:''' They're looking for Marinette Dupain-Cheng, one of their classmates.
'''Cat Noir:''' Haven't we already saved her a bunch of times? Funny you'd think everybody would like her.
'''Ladybug:''' Well apparently, she's managed to alienate all her friends at once. ''(struggles to think about the recent event)''
'''Cat Noir:''' You still there? 
'''Ladybug:''' Just thinking. With five villians it's not gonna be easy finding the object that has the akuma. 
'''Cat Noir:''' I bet you already have an idea, right? 
'''Ladybug:''' I'm going to isolate one of the villains from the others and get her to tell me where the akuma is. Meanwhile, you find Timebreaker to stop her from going back in the past, otherwise she could really screw up my plan.
'''Cat Noir:''' Good luck, M'lady. 
'''Ladybug:''' Thanks, you too.

'''Lady Wifi:''' Ha, bummer for you, Ladybug. I don't have the akuma.
'''Ladybug:''' No biggie, I just wanted to talk to you anyway.
'''Lady Wifi:''' I've got nothing to say to you.

'''Ladybug:''' I don't know what happened between the two of you, but I wanna tell you about a friend of mine. She's a superhero. You know Rena Rouge right? 
''(Lady Wifi realizes her superhero identity)''
'''Ladybug:''' Of course, we keep secrets from one another, mainly because of my secret identity, but even though we can't tell each other everything, we trust each other. And that's why we can fight side by side. You can reject the power that Shadow Moth gave you.
''(Lady Wifi begins to break free)''
'''Shadow Moth:''' ''(from his lair)'' Don't listen to her Lady Wifi. If you do that, you'll never know your friend's secrets! Or Ladybug's! 
'''Ladybug:''' I trust you completely Alya. And I need you! I.. need Rena Rouge! ''(un-tangles Lady Wifi)''

</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The alleyway.}} 
<poem>
'''Ladybug:''' Which object holds the akuma? 
'''Alya:''' It's in a bracelet. Timebreaker must have it, but you and Cat Noir will never be able to take on four villains at once.  
'''Ladybug:''' I think this calls for the master of Illusion. ''(opens her yo-yo and takes out the [[Fox Miraculous]])''
'''Alya:''' Woah! How'd you do that? 
'''Ladybug:''' There have been a few upgrades since I became Guardian of the Miraculous. 
'''Alya:''' You're Guardian of the- ''(gasps)''
'''Ladybug:''' Yeah, keep it on the down low. Not a word about it on the LadyBlog.

'''Cat Noir:''' At the very moment you touch it, I'll summon my power and then who knows what's gonna happen to you.

'''Ladybug:''' Give them what they want, now!
'''Rena Rouge:''' Mirage! 
'''Marinette Illusion:''' Cat Noir, no! 
'''Gang of Secrets:''' Marinette!

'''Rena Rouge:''' Pound it? 
'''Ladybug, Rena Rouge, and Cat Noir:''' Pound it!

'''Shadow Moth:''' You've made mistakes before Ladybug, and you'll make them again! One day, I will discover your secret! ''(the window closes)''

'''Rena Rouge:''' Let's rest. ''(de-transforms and gives a high-five to Trixx.)'' 
'''Alya:''' Thank you, Ladybug.
'''Ladybug:''' You know, without you and Cat Noir, I wouldn't have made it through today. I'm really lucky to have friends like you. So, thank you. 
''(Ladybug and Alya hug each other.)''

<poem>
''(Marinette is holding the friendship bracelet, and admits to the breakup)''
'''Marinette:''' It's true, breaking up with Luka broke my heart. And never being able to tell Adrien how I feel is just as painful. Love is too difficult. I think- I think I'm gonna stick to friendship, that's about all I can handle right now.
'''Rose:''' Take your time.
'''Mylène:''' It'll all work out. 
'''Alya:''' And whatever happens, we'll always be here for you. ''(the girls hug Marinette)''
'''Alix:''' When you're ready for love, just make sure you tell us, so we can help you with a sick new plan to win over Adrien, Luka or whoever! 
'''Girls:''' ''(laugh)''
'''Marinette:''' Girls, it's ''you'' who I love. ''(all the girls hug again)''
'''Rose:''' Bye, Marinette.
'''Alix:''' Bye! See ya tomorrow. 
''(Marinette once again looks distraught; Alya notices)''
'''Alya:''' You go ahead girls, I just have one last thing to say to Marinette. 
''(Alya closes the door to Marinette's room)''
'''Alya:''' You didn't tell us everything, did you? A journalist and a BFF can tell these things. 
''(Marinette feels guilty and sadly sits down)''
'''Alya:''' I won't try to figure it out or force it out of you. ''(sits beside her)'' If you can't tell me what's in your heart, it's your right.  
'''Marinette:''' Will we still be friends? 
'''Alya:''' Marinette. I'm your best friend, and I'll always be. That's why it kills me that I can't help you with whatever's making you feel so alone.
''(Alya sighs, and is about to leave Marinette's room when Marinette grabs her hand.)''
'''Marinette:''' Alya, wait! Stay. You're right, I am alone. ''(grows increasingly emotional)'' More than ever before. I can barely take it anymore! You know why I broke up with Luka? Not because I don't like him, he's amazing! It's 'cause there's something that I can't tell him. You know why I have to forget Adrien? For the exact same reason! You're right, I keep secrets, I lie all the time! I lie to my friends, to my parents, to everyone and the worst thing is, I can't do it any other way!
'''Alya:''' There's always another way. 
'''Marinette:''' No, not this time. I have no choice. All this is bigger than us, Alya. Way too big.
'''Alya:''' If it's too big, two of us can handle it better than one.
'''Marinette:''' If I tell you, things will never be the same between us again. ''(shakes her head)'' It'll mess up everything, maybe even destroy it.
'''Alya:''' ''(voice breaking)'' Marinette, I'm your very best friend.
'''Marinette:''' And I… I'm Ladybug. 
''(Alya becomes surprised, that someone, whom she admired the most was her best friend, before she hugs Marinette, with the kwamis looking on, possibly distressed and worried.)''
