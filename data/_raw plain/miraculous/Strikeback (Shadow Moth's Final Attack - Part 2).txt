{{Scene|Scene: [[Gabriel's atelier]]. [[Adrien]] searches for [[Gabriel Agreste|his father]].}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': Father?
''(His Risk mark activates, and Adrien spots something gleaming on the floor... the [[Félix's revealer lens|monocle]] [[Félix Graham de Vanily|Félix]] used to scan the whole room. The environment shakes, and Adrien is shocked and turns around. He runs to the window and notices [[Strikeback (sentimonster)|Strikeback]] wandering outside.)''
'''Adrien''': I'll have to talk to my father later! ''(runs off)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': [[Plagg]], claws out! ''(transforms into Cat Noir and leaps away)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Roof of the [[Gare du Nord]]. [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] sadly climbs up and de-transforms.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': ''(moans sadly)'' Spots off. ''(de-transforms into Marinette)''
'''Marinette''': ''(crestfallen)'' It's all over, [[Tikki]].
'''Tikki''': He'll be back, Marinette. He's just going on a voyage!
'''Marinette''': ''(her Risk mark activates)'' Of course, [[Voyage]]! Ladybug may have failed, but Pegabug will bring him back! And together we'll go talk to his father!
'''Tikki''': You wanna use the [[Horse Miraculous|Miraculous of the Horse]] and teleport yourself, just for that?
'''Marinette''': I'm ready to risk everything to ''not'' lose Adrien! Tikki, spots on! ''(transforms into Ladybug)''
''(Ladybug opens her yo-yo to take the Horse Miraculous and wears it upon obtaining it.)''
'''Ladybug''': Tikki, Kaalki, [[Unification|unify]]—
''(The heavy stomps of Strikeback disrupt her, and she takes off the glasses.)''
'''Ladybug''': Okay, I guess I'll have to deal with this small problem first, but I'll be back to save you soon, Adrien!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Startrain. Félix, posing as Adrien, is looking by the window. [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Nathalie]] tries to comfort him.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': ''(holds Félix's hand)'' Try to make the most out of this trip, Adrien. You're about to discover the world, and then you'll return to all of your friends and your father with fantastic memories to share with them.
'''Félix''': You're right, Nathalie. You have to seize the opportunity when it presents itself to you.
'''[[Lila Rossi|Lila]]''': And we'll end up being the best friends in the world, since we're going to see it all together.
'''Félix''': I hope so with all my heart. Please excuse me for a moment.
''(Nathalie steps out for a while as Félix walks away from them with a secret intent. In the lavatory, he equips the [[Peacock Miraculous]] and finds the [[Miraculous spellbook|Grimoire]]'s written instructions as pictured in Nathalie's tablet.)''
'''Félix''': Ah, here we go. "Attach the brooch." Okay, that's done. "[[Duusu|The kwami]] comes out of the jewel. Say the magic words, 'Duusu, spread my feathers'." Duusu, spread my feathers!
''(With no transformation occurring, Félix realizes that there is something suspicious about the jewel. He clenches the "Peacock Miraculous" in his fist, and it breaks into minuscule pieces, slamming his fist after.)''
'''Félix''': It's a fake!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On the Parisian rooftops. Strikeback is still wandering around, and Ladybug chases after the sentimonster. Cat Noir jumps in from behind, joining her.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': Okay, m'lady. Let's wrap this one up quickly. I've got... a full schedule.
'''Ladybug''': Fine by me, kitty cat. I've got some urgent stuff to attend to. ''(both heroes leap up)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On top of the Eiffel Tower. Shadow Moth watches the chaos throughout the city.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': [[Froggy|My dear akumatized friend]], sing as much as you can. We must ensure that Ladybug and Cat Noir will take countless risks today.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Parisian streets. Risk rides his toy wheel while singing his song.}}
<poem>
'''Risk''': ♪ I'm Froggy, here I come. I'm not afraid of anyone. ♪
'''Parisian 1''': Hey, if we wait a bit, we should see Ladybug and Cat Noir!
'''Parisian 2''': I'm gonna get so many likes for this!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On top of the Eiffel Tower. Shadow Moth commands the sentimonster.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': Unleash your power, Strikeback!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Roue de Paris]]. Strikeback throws the landmark towards the Parisians.}}
<poem>
'''Parisian 2''': Check that out!
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir arrive. Ladybug throws her yo-yo to create a net, stopping the ferris wheel from dealing more damage.)''
'''Parisian 2''': I gotta get a video!
''(As the ferris wheel stops, it leans towards the buildings beside it.)''
'''Ladybug''': What's wrong with you? It's dangerous to stay here, shoo!
''(The Parisians, although evidently furious, leave, following Ladybug's orders.)''<!-- unsure to split scenes here-->
'''Cat Noir''': Hey, little buddy old pal! Over here!
''(Strikeback punches towards Cat Noir a few times, destroying the surroundings. A few debris fall near Risk, who Ladybug catches and reels back along with his toy wheel.)''
'''Ladybug''': Don't stay here, otherwise you risk getting hit by the bad guy! ''(leaps off)''
'''Risk''': ''(continues cycling)'' ♪ I'm Froggy, here I come. I'm not afraid of anyone. ♪
''(Cat Noir approaches Strikeback, and upon hearing Risk's song, a risk takes effect.)''<!-- unsure to split scenes here too-->
'''Cat Noir''': Come on, no time to waste! [[Cataclysm|Cata]]—
'''Ladybug''': ''(holds his arm)'' What are you doing? ''(throws her yo-yo to catch Strikeback)''
'''Cat Noir''' I'll use my power, you get the akuma, and bam. We can both go back to what we were doing. ''(extends his [[staff]])''
'''Ladybug''': Who knows what your power would do directly on an akumatized person? And if it's a sentimonster, a cataclysm would send it out of control!
''(Ladybug reels in Strikeback and immediately lets go, making Strikeback trip from the recoil. Strikeback hits a few buildings from the fall.)''
'''Cat Noir''' Well, brilliant. That's control? What's the difference with what I was saying?
'''Ladybug''': No way, it's too risky.
'''Cat Noir''': ''(groans)'' That's the problem with you. You never want to take any risks.
'''Ladybug''': Of course, I do! I take risks all the time!
'''Cat Noir''': Oh yeah? Would you risk knowing who I really am behind my mask?
'''Ladybug''': You know ''very'' well that—
''(As soon as they notice a shadow, they look above to see Strikeback punching towards them. Cat Noir grabs Ladybug and jumps off, both landing on the pavements.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Our identites have to remain secret, I know. ''(gets up)'' So why do you know the identities of the other holders? So why not me?
'''Ladybug''': I already told you, if I knew who you were, Shadow Moth would only need to akumatize ''me'' to get to you. I'm doing this to protect you.
''(Ladybug notices a giant foot about to stomp on them and grabs Cat Noir to swing out to another rooftop. Cat Noir gets up.)''
'''Cat Noir''': I don't need you to protect me. We'll never get akumatized!
''(His akumatized form, Cat Blanc, flashes back through Ladybug's mind.)''
'''Ladybug''': You don't know what you're talking about.
'''Cat Noir''': Maybe because you never talk to me about anything!
'''[[Alya Césaire|Rena Furtive]]''': ''(to Ladybug, on-call)'' Ladybug, watch out!
''(Ladybug looks up to find Strikeback about to crush them. They both jump out, and Ladybug takes a risk.)''
'''Ladybug''': Nice one, Rena.
'''Cat Noir''': ''(surprised)'' Huh? Rena Rouge? Where is she?
'''Ladybug''': Uh... Rena who?
''(Cat Noir squints in annoyance.)''
'''Ladybug''': Fine, she's hidden. It's best you don't know where, it's—
'''Cat Noir''': Risky, yeah, right. I think I get it.
'''Risk''': ♪ I'm Froggy, here I come. I'm not afraid of anyone. ♪
'''Ladybug''': Oh, come on, not this again! ''(swings away to chase after Risk)''
'''[[André Bourgeois|André]]''': Finally! Something more exciting than power or money: the magic of cinema!
''(André is about to get stomped by Strikeback but Cat Noir swiftly saves him a second before Strikeback lands their foot. They take refuge behind a car.)''
'''Cat Noir''': This is no time for a film shoot, Mr. Mayor! It's pretty risky, okay?
''(André shrugs at Cat Noir's remark. Meanwhile, the reporters' helicopter takes a risk as they fly near the radius of Strikeback.)''
'''Person on the helicopter''': Head straight for him! If he attacks us, that'll make for some great footage! 
''(Strikeback hits the helicopter, sending it flying uncontrollably and about to crash on the streets. Luckily, the helicopter gets saved by Cat Noir's staff. Ladybug and Cat Noir stand beside Risk without any prior knowledge that they are already standing beside the akumatized victim.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Do you think this villain is the reason why people are acting unusual?
'''Ladybug''': Maybe. All I know is that we won't be able to defeat him if we keep having to save people all the time. I'll go for reinforcements. Stall him!
''(Cat Noir nods in agreement and proceeds to distract Strikeback.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(to Risk)'' Fighting supervillains isn't fun and games. Go find your parents. ''(leaps away)''
''(Shadow Moth's butterfly halo appears on Risk.)''
'''Shadow Moth''' ''(to Risk)'' Keep it up! Taking risks always pays off in the end!
'''Risk''': ''(continues cycling)'' ♪ I'm Froggy, here I come. I'm not afraid of anyone. ♪
''(Ladybug gathers the Miraculous team as she distributes them to [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]], [[Kagami Tsurugi|Kagami]], [[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]], [[Zoé Lee|Zoé]], [[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]], [[Marc Anciel|Marc]] and [[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]] and the others as they transform to their superhero identities. [[Alya Césaire|Rena Furtive]] stays hidden at the rooftop of the Montparnasse Tower while she uses her flute as a telescope to check if everyone is in position. She spots Risk cycling freely on the streets.)''
'''Rena Furtive''': ''(on-call)'' Ladybug, that froggy kid still isn't getting it.
'''Ladybug''': Not again! Quick, come with me! ''(The heroes begin their run.)'' Vesperia, immobilize the villain!
''(Vesperia leaps on top of Strikeback and activates her power.)''
'''Vesperia''': [[Venom]]!
''(She pierces her top on Strikeback, causing the monster to stop moving. Ladybug swings to grab Risk to safety. Unfortunately, Strikeback begins to move again and absorbs the power of Vesperia.)''
'''Vesperia''': Huh... it's not working!
'''Purple Tigress''': ''(leaps in the air and activates her power as well)'' [[Clout]]!
''(Purple Tigress successfully hits Strikeback but the hit only results in it absorbing her powers, too. Strikeback throws her off the streets and Vesperia comes to her rescue.)''
'''Purple Tigress''': Impossible!
''(Strikeback is about to hit them with another blow just before Polymouse activates her power in front of Vesperia and Purple Tigress.)''
'''Polymouse''': [[Multitude]]! 
''(She creates three copies of herself, having the two copies save Vesperia and Purple Tigress from Strikeback. The sentimonster throws its fist toward Polymouse as she multiplies into smaller versions of herself)'' 
'''Strikeback''': Strike Back!
''(It multiplies into three copies)''
'''Strikeback''': Strike Back!
''(It’s two copies activates the powers of the Venom and Clout.)''
'''Rena Furtive''': ''(from the Montparnasse Tower)'' He can copy our powers!
'''Ladybug''': Don't attack them! Don't hit him anymore! Or else it'll make him even more powerful! Retreat to city hall now! ''(swings away with Risk)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: On top of the city hall, the heroes gather up. Strikeback grabs the [[Roue de Paris]] and, with Clout, launches it towards the direction where the heroes are.}}
<poem>
'''Ryuko''': Wind dragon! 
''(Ryuko successfully prevents the Ferris wheel from hitting them, yet, it flies to the direction where Rena Furtive is. This causes Carapace to panic.)
'''Carapace''': Rena! ''(takes out his shield)'' [[Shell-ter]]!
''(Carapace's shield luckily prevents the Ferris wheel from hitting Rena Furtive on top of the [[Tour Montparnasse]]. But the information of Rena Furtive's active status shocks the heroes, as well as Shadow Moth.)''
'''The heroes''': Rena?!
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: On top of the Eiffel Tower.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': She's still active?
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: On top of the city hall, Ladybug glares at Carapace and Rena Furtive.}}
<poem>
'''Rena Furtive''': ''(on-call from Tour Montparnasse)'' I-I'm sorry. I couldn't keep it from him.
'''Ladybug''': We'll talk about it later. ''(to the other heroes)'' Okay, you, that's enough now. You're putting us all in danger. 
'''Risk''': ''(off-screen)'' ♪ I'm Froggy, here I come. I'm not afraid of anyone. ♪
''(Rena spots the frog mark on Ladybug's nape, as well as on the other heroes' napes as realization dawns over her. Risk dances in front of them as he continues singing.)''
'''Risk''': ♪ Come shine or come rain, I ain't scared 'cause you're all lame! ♪
''(Ladybug growls in annoyance.)''
'''Cat Noir''': I'm good with kids. I got this. ''(takes Risk away)''
'''Rena Furtive''': ''(on-call)'' Ladybug, everyone's got a mark in a shape of a frog's foot on their necks.
'''Ladybug''': What??
'''Rena Furtive''': ''(on-call)'' You, Cat Noir, the others, all the people of Paris... we've all got that mark!
''(Cat Noir is seen flying and gets knocked to the rooftop's edge, which makes Ladybug see the frog mark on his nape, shocking her. Ladybug turns to see Risk standing on another rooftop.)''
'''Risk''': ♪ When Froggy's near, there's nothing to fear. Risk is my name and you're all so— ♪
'''Cat Noir''': Blind! We were blind. We're not just dealing with a sentimonster. There's also an akumatized villain!
'''Ladybug''': That's why we're being so careless. It's him that's making us taking all these risks!
''(Risk sticks his tongue out and teases the heroes.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(laughs maniacally)'' Now that Ladybug knows they've all been hit, she will doubt everything! And above all, herself!
'''Ladybug''': Cat Noir, you need to de-transform!
'''Cat Noir''': What??
'''Ladybug''': Until I've de-akumatized him, I can't leave you with your cataclysm. It's too risky! Minotaurox, Purple Tigress, Polymouse, with me! We'll never be able to beat the sentimonsters until we defeat Risk! Everyone else, try to limit the damages.
''(The heroes agree with the plan as they all leap away to the rooftops. Ladybug, Purple Tigress, Minotaurox and Polymouse chase after Risk as the other heroes prevent Risk from creating more casualties in the city. Cat Noir is left on the rooftops per Ladybug's order, leaving him shocked and frustrated.)
'''Cat Noir''': But I can help... ''(The frog mark takes effect as he takes the risk of fighting the sentimonsters, not following Ladybug's orders.)''
''(The four heroes taking care of Risk continue to chase after him. Purple Tigress manages to grapple Risk as Ladybug takes his nunchucks and breaks it, with no akuma freed from it. Ladybug proceeds to break everything that Risk owns only to find no akuma flying away.)''
'''Ladybug''': Nothing! No akuma!
'''Risk''': I tricked you! You'll never find my akuma 'cause my object's hidden from you!
''(Ladybug gasps in shock and turns her head to the three sentimonsters wreaking havoc to the city.)''
'''Ladybug''': Okay, let's split up! Keep looking!
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Parisian streets. Cat Noir is pinned on a building by Strikeback. He activates his cataclysm.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': Cataclysm!
''(Strikeback unfortunately touches his ring and mimics his power.)''
'''Cat Noir''': No!
'''Strikeback''': Strikeback!
''(The sentimonster activates the cataclysm and destroys the [[Tour Montparnasse]].)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: On the rooftops. Ladybug is alerted from the sentimonster's damage.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': Cat Noir! No, I told him! This is a nightmare... ''(gasps)'' Unless...
<center>'''''[Superpower sequence]''<br />Ladybug:''' [[Lucky Charm]]!<br />''(She gets a ticket.)''</center>
'''Ladybug''': A ticket for the [[Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes|Jardin des Plantes]]? It's from yesterday... ''(gasps)'' I know! I've gotta put an end to this madness ASAP! ''(leaps off)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: An alleyway.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': Okay! I need someone who hasn't been hit.
''(Ladybug flashes back to what she sees as Adrien's departure, and her vision zooms in on his nape.)''
'''Félix (flashback)''': Farewell, Ladybug.
'''Ladybug''': ''(gasps)'' Adrien! But I've been hit by Risk! Maybe my idea's way too risky, or is it a risk not to take this risk? Am I doing this for the love of risk, or the risk of love? ''(groans)''
''(Ladybug opens her yo-yo and reaches for the [[Rabbit Miraculous]] and Horse Miraculous. She wears the two Miraculouses.)''
'''Ladybug''': No. It's Adrien, and he doesn't have the mark. It's a good idea! Tikki, [[Fluff]], Kaalki, unify! ''(transforms into Pennybug)''
'''Pennybug''': Voyage!
''(A portal opens, sending her to the Startrain.)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Startrain. Pennybug exits out of the lavatory, while Félix exits out of the adjacent. They are both surprised.}}
<poem>
'''Félix''': Who are you?
'''Pennybug''': Oh! It's me, Ladybug. Or rather, Ladybug with a few extra powers. Pennybug! Wait!
''(Pennybug checks Félix's neck immediately, still under the impression that he is Adrien.)''
'''Pennybug''': ''(sighs)'' You're alright. Adrien, I need your help. ''(retrieves the [[Dog Miraculous]])'' I have to find an object.
'''Félix''': Y... Your yo-yo gives you direct access to all the Miraculous?
'''Pennybug''': The ones in my [[Miracle Box]], yes. It's a magic shortcut.
'''Félix''': Wow!
'''Pennybug''': Adrien Agreste, here is the Miraculous of the dog which will grant you the power to locate and [[fetch]] whatever your ball has touched. You will use it for the greater good, then you will return it to me.... Can I trust you?
''(Félix looks at the Miraculous intensely.)''
'''Pennybug''': If you're doubting yourself, then trying is the only way you can gain the confidence you need.
''(Félix nods and wears the Miraculous, and [[Barkk]] appears.)''
'''Barkk''': Hi, I'm Barkk! The kwami of adoration! I'm so happy to have a new holder, you and I can play ball! All you have to say is, "Barkk, on the hunt"!
'''Félix''': With pleasure. Barkk, on the hunt!
<center>'''''[Transformation sequence]''<br />(Félix transforms into Flairmidable)''</center>
'''Pennybug''': Thanks to your superpower, you can locate any object that you've touched before.
'''Flairmidable''': Oh! Uh... ''(touches her yo-yo)'' Like this?<!-- Félix you little madman -->
'''Pennybug''': No! With the [[ball]]. A light touch will be enough.
'''Félix''': Okay, I get it. What about the object I'm supposed to find? Where is it?
'''Pennybug''': In the past. [[Burrow]]!
''(Pennybug enters the portal and Flairmidable follows.)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Burrow.}}<!-- [SSQMinky] Should I call this Pocket dimension instead?? -->
<poem>
'''Pennybug''': We have to find the little boy before he was akumatized.
'''Flairmidable''': You can travel through time?
'''Pennybug''': ''(reverses a window)'' Yes. And even though time travel is always risky, today we have to take that risk.
'''Froggy's Dad''': ''(in window)'' Froggy! Come back!
'''Pennybug''': Found it!
''(They both enter into the past.)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes, [[Risk (Shadow Moth's Final Attack - Part 1)/Transcript#Burrow|in the past]].}}
<poem>
'''Pennybug''': As soon as we know which object is going to be akumatized, you have to hit it with the ball, but without anyone seeing so you don't interfere with the course of events.
'''Froggy's Mom''': Froggy, come back! It's time to go home!
''(The akuma infects Froggy's stuffed toy.)''
'''Pennybug''': His fluffy! Of course!
'''Froggy''': Oh! Will it work on my parents too?
''(Flairmidable throws his ball to the stuffed toy, and it rolls back to him.)''
'''Pennybug''': Let's go, come on!
''(Pennybug and Flairmidable enter back into the burrow.)''
'''Froggy''': Yeah! ''(transforms into Risk)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Burrow.}}
<poem>
'''Flairmidable''': But we don't know where he's going to hide his bag!
'''Pennybug''': Thanks to your power, we don't need to.
''(They both jump out to the present timeline.)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Present timeline, Paris. Pennybug and Flairmidable step out the Burrow.}}
<poem>
'''Pennybug''': Fluff, Kaalki, divide! ''(reverts back to Ladybug)''
''(As Ladybug takes off her sunglasses, both her and Flairmidable gasp in shock, seeing the sentimonsters have already caused great chaos in the city. The heroes are down on the pavement as they look at Strikeback in fear. On the rooftops, Cat Noir continues to take risks as he lures Strikeback to his direction.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Come on, bring it! I'm not scared of you!
''(Strikeback throws its fist towards the rooftop where Cat Noir stood and dodged it.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(to Flairmidable)'' Hurry! He won't last long!
'''Flairmidable''': ''(takes out his ball)'' [[Fetch]]!
''(His ball lights up and flies to where the akumatized object is. As the ball touches the stuffed frog toy, the ball and the akumatized object appear on his hands. Ladybug takes the toy and pulls its arm to break the akuma free.)''
'''Ladybug''': No more evil doing for you, megakuma! ''(catches the megakuma and proceeds to throw her lucky charm object)'' [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]!
''(The magical ladybugs clear up the marks on their necks and frees them from Risk's effects.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(on the rooftops)'' Yeah, uh- actually, how about we continue this later? You guys stay right there, okay? ''(He flees quickly away from Strikeback who brings yet another blow on where he stood. He proceeds to hide behind a chimney as he sees Ladybug admiring Flairmidable's skills.)''
'''Ladybug''': Awesome! Well done! You did what's needed to be done on your first try. I knew you were the one I needed! You really are the best, Adri— I mean...
'''Flairmidable''': Flairmidable. Call me Flairmidable.
'''Ladybug''': It really suits you!
'''Ladybug and Flairmidable''': Pound it! 
''(The two heroes leap away, leaving Cat Noir dejected, and he proceeds to follow them.)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: In the streets, Ladybug and Flairmidable returns the frog plushie to Froggy.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': Here you go, little buddy! Even though you're so brave that you're not scared of Shadow Moth, ''(hands Froggy back his frog plushie, this time with his own [[Magical Charms|Magical Charm]] as its necklace)'' with this, you'll still remember to always be careful.
'''Froggy''': ''(hugs his plushie)'' Thank you, Ladybug!
'''Ladybug''': ''(to the heroes)'' Let's go recharge before dealing with these sentimonsters!
''(The heroes jump off to their rendezvous points, with a crestfallen Cat Noir being the last one to leave. He simply runs off.)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: On top of the Eiffel Tower.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': Risk has been defeated, but Ladybug must have made a mistake of some kind, and I can't wait to see what it is. The battle is not over, Strikeback!
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Sewers. Ladybug and Flairmidable run off to different directions to de-transform.}}

'''Ladybug''': Spots off! ''(de-transforms into Marinette)''
'''Flairmidable''': Lay down! ''(de-transforms into Félix)''
''(Tikki munches on a macaron.)''
'''Marinette''': Thanks again, Adrien. I'll take you back to the train.
'''Félix''': I don't wanna get back on that train. I wanna stay and fight with you.
'''Marinette''': What about your trip? Are you going to stand up to your father?
'''Félix''': Yes. You've given me the courage I need, Ladybug. I feel like from now on, nothing can stop me.
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: A rooftop. The heroes are watching Strikeback wreck more buildings as Ladybug and Flairmidable arrive.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': Hey, everyone! Meet Flairmidable, the new holder of the Dog Miraculous.
''(Cat Noir climbs up, arriving in time.)''
'''Ladybug''': Oh, Cat Noir! Miraculous of the dog, Miraculous of the cat! Dog and cat! ''(laughs)'' Funny isn't it? ''(laughs)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(unamused)'' Hilarious.
'''Flairmidable''': Nice working with you, Cat Noir.
'''Ladybug''': Come on! Shake paws.
''(The two heroes shake hands.)''
'''Ladybug''': I knew you two would get along. That's the magic of the Miraculous, even dogs and cats can exist in harmony! You're gonna be spending a ''lot'' of time together now that he's joined the team! ''(chuckles)'' Forever. ''(to all heroes)'' Ready Miraculous team?
<center>'''''[Superpower sequence]''<br />Ladybug:''' [[Lucky Charm]]!<br />''(She gets sunglasses.)''</center>
''(Her lucky vision highlights the sunglasses and the sentimonsters as part of her plan.)''
'''Ladybug''': Since we can't attack them, we're gonna trap them. We'll be cunning, no needless risks. Rooster Bold, since you can choose you power, give yourself the power to multiply objects. We'll need more pairs of sunglasses.
'''Rooster Bold''': [[Sublimation]]!
''(As everyone watches Rooster Bold multiply the sunglasses, Flairmidable touches Ladybug's yo-yo)''
'''Ladybug''': Next, we'll lure all the sentimonsters to the same place. Carapace, you'll create a shield so that they can't escape, and finally, I'll transform into Pegabug and open a portal that the sentimonsters will fall into.
'''Flairmidable''': A portal where?
'''Ladybug''': ''(wears glasses)'' To some place where they can never hurt anyone again.
''(Flairmidable wears the glasses.)''
'''Ladybug''': It's showtime, guys!
''(The heroes jump off towards Strikeback for their plan, except for Flairmidable.)''
'''Carapace''': Shell-ter!
'''Pegabug''': Voyage!
''(A portal opens to the sun, and the three sentimonsters fall into the portal. Flairmidable drops his sunglasses to leave for his uncle.)''
'''Flairmidable''': I'm sorry.
'''Pegabug''': Miraculous Ladybug!
''(The magical ladybugs fix the damage done by the sentimonsters.)''

'''Rena Furtive''': Let's rest. ''(de-transforms into Alya)''
'''Alya''': ''(sadly)'' I'm sorry. I— I couldn't lie to Nino, we share everything, you know?
''(She takes off her [[Fox Miraculous|necklace]] and hands it to Ladybug, who closes Alya's fist.)''
'''Ladybug''': I get it. I share everything with my best friend, ''(hugs Alya)'' and I wasn't able to lie to her either.
'''Alya''': You shouldn't ever trust me with it again. It's too risky, now that Shadow Moth knows. But I don't need to be a superhero to be your friend. You know that, right? Trixx, I renounce you.
''(Trixx disappears into the Miraculous, and Alya hands it over.)''
'''Alya''': ''(while wiping her tears)'' Go get the other Miraculous back before you de-transform.

'''Flairmidable''': Ladybug did indeed make a mistake... ''uncle''.
''(Gabriel drops his phone in shock.)''
'''Nathalie''': ''(on-call)'' I've lost Adrien, sir. He's no longer on the train.
'''Gabriel''': Félix?
'''Nathalie''': Sir?

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Adrien walks out of his bathroom displeased, while Ladybug swings in.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': Phew! There you are. I'm sorry I thought I told you we were supposed to meet up.
'''Adrien''': Meet up?
'''Ladybug''': Yes, so you could give it back to me.
'''Adrien''': Give what back to you?
'''Ladybug''': Well, the Miraculous of the dog.
'''Adrien''': But you didn't give me anything.
'''Ladybug''': Of course, I did! On the train.
'''Adrien''': The train? ...''Félix''!
''(Ladybug's eyes enlargen as she gasps in horror.)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Gabriel's office. Gabriel interrogates Flairmidable.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': What do you want, Félix?
'''Flairmidable''': I want the ''real'' Peacock Miraculous. And you’re going to give it to me.
'''Gabriel''': I don't know what you're talking about.
'''Flairmidable''': Do you want me to tell Adrien about the secret code on the painting? Then, give me what I ask for and I'll give you something better in exchange.
'''Gabriel''': Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous?
'''Flairmidable''': No. All the ''other'' Miraculous. And this. I won't be needing it anymore. As long as Ladybug hasn't de-transformed, I only have to say one word and her yo-yo, the magic portal to the Miraculous, will be yours. Make up your mind, time is ticking. ''(spins the ball on his finger)''
'''Gabriel''': How do I know that you won't use the Peacock Miraculous against us?
'''Flairmidable''': If I wanted to harm you, uncle, I would've done it a ''long'' time ago. ''(places one of the twin rings on the table in trade for the Peacock Miraculous)''
'''Gabriel''': ''(takes off his ascot tie)'' Duusu, I renounce you. ''(places the Peacock Miraculous on the table)''
''(As they both place their jewels to trade on the table, the two glared at one another and eventually swap quickly, so they won't be cheated once again. Gabriel wears the ring and Flairmidable grabs the Peacock Miraculous.)''
'''Flairmidable''': Fetch!
''(His ball flies towards Adrien's room, coming in contact with Ladybug's yo-yo and absorbs it. The ball returns to Flairmidable along with the yo-yo as Gabriel quickly (and joyfully) takes hold of it.)''
'''Gabriel''': ''(overjoyed)'' Ah! You've lost, Ladybug! Finally!
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Ladybug begins to panic now that she knows Flairmidable, or rather Félix, had already seized the opportunity to steal her yo-yo.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': ''(panicking; panting)'' The ball... of the dog... Félix... He has the yo-yo, and that means... he has the Miraculous!
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Gabriel's office. Gabriel triumphantly grabs every Miraculous inside Ladybug's yo-yo and places them on the table one by one.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': ''(laughs maniacally)'' My greatest wish will finally come true!
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Ladybug starts hyperventilating as her anxiety gets worse and worse.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': ''(crouches down)'' Ladybug, try to keep calm. Think. There must be a way to get your yo-yo back.
'''Ladybug''': Yes, maybe if I transform back and then—
'''Adrien''': Go ahead, ''(opens the door to his bathroom)'' you'll be safe here.
'''Ladybug''': I-I don't know anymore, I— What if this is a trap? What if you're Félix?
'''Adrien''': If you're gonna trust me once, please let it be this time! ''(closes the door)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(pants and falls dejectedly on the floor)'' Spots off.. ''(de-transforms)''
'''Marinette''': Please hurry, Tikki. ''(gives a piece of macaron to Tikki)'' We can't let them take all the Miraculous, please let there be some left, there has to be some left! ''(cries)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Gabriel's office. Gabriel continues to marvel at all the Miraculous scattered on the table.}}
<poem>
'''Flairmidable''': Lay down. 
''(He de-transforms into Félix. Barkk flies beside him.)''
'''Félix''': Barkk, I renounce you. 
''(Barkk disappears as Félix places the Dog Miraculous alongside the others on the table and leaves the room, leaving a triumphant Gabriel alone.)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's bathroom. Tikki finishes eating her macaron.}}
<poem>
'''Tikki''': I'm done!
'''Marinette''': ''(in panic)'' Tikki, spots on! ''(transforms into Ladybug)''
''(Just as she transforms, her yo-yo on Gabriel's desk disappears. She quickly opens it and checks if there are still any Miraculous left inside, only to find nothing.)''
'''Ladybug''': No! There's nothing left!
'''Adrien''': ''(from the other side of the door)'' Ladybug...?
'''Ladybug''': ''(crestfallen)'' I've lost...!
''(Adrien looks down for a while, sympathizing with Ladybug and decides to open the door to look out for her, only to find his bathroom already empty, much to his sadness.)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Rooftops of the Jardins du Trocadéro, Ladybug is sitting all by herself under the rain, crying. Then, out of nowhere, in front of the Eiffel Tower, Hawk Moth starts to laugh maniacally as he appears with his head shaped with his akumas, alongside with all the powers of the Miraculous, to Ladybug's horror.}}
<poem>
'''Hawk Moth''': People of Paris, Ladybug had promised to protect you. Well, she lied to you! Behold, her defeat! I took all the Miraculous from her! Now I'm more powerful than ever! From now on, I will be attacking you relentlessly. I would be everywhere probing your thoughts, steal your dreams, harnessing your deepest fears! Whatever damage I can cause, I will not stop! Unless... someone brings me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!
''(As Hawk Moth explains further his plans, we see the reactions of all of Ladybug and Cat Noir's allies, in the sidelines: Luka, Kagami, Alya, Nino, Juleka, Rose, Ivan, Mylene, [[Su-Han]], Zoé and, ironically, [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] watch in shock, horror and slight anger. In his train back to London, Félix smiles deviously at the Peacock Miraculous. We finally see Ladybug, completely overwhelmed with crushing shock and distress.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(gasps)'' I've lost everything! ''(cries)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(off-screen)'' You haven't lost me.
''(Ladybug gasps as she turns her head to look at Cat Noir who is already standing beside her.)''
'''Ladybug''': Why don't you just give up on me? I lost all the Miraculous, I'm the worst Guardian ever! I wanted to control everything, I didn't listen to you, I lied to you, I kept you at a distance! Every time you offered me a helping hand, I never took it! I really made a mess of everything!... ''(continues crying)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(reaches out his hand to Ladybug)'' M'lady...
''(Ladybug blushes as she slowly takes his hand. Cat Noir picks her up and hugs her.)
'''Cat Noir''': We're gonna get them back one by one, until the very last. And we'll make sure this never happens again!
'''Ladybug''': You... and me?
'''Cat Noir''': You, the best superhero there ever was, ''(points at the huge crowd of Parisians below them, cheering for them)'' them, the people of Paris...
'''Parisians''': Ladybug! Ladybug! Ladybug! Ladybug!
'''Cat Noir''': And me, your loyal partner.
''(The Parisians continue to cheer for them. Ladybug stands stern side-by-side with Cat Noir, as her tears get taken away by the wind, getting ready to face the villainous Hawk Moth, once and for all.)''
