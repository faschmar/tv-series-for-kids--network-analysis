{{Scene|Scene: Collège Françoise Dupont, Ms. Bustier's Classroom, [[Caline Bustier|Ms. Bustier]] hands over career questionnaires to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]].}}
<poem>
'''[[Mr. Damocles]]''': Your class representative, Marinette, is going to be handing you a questionnaire to fill out regarding your study options after school.
''(Marinette begins to distribute the questionnaires, starting with [[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]].)''
'''[[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]''': Utterly useless! I already know what I want to be when school is over: rich, because I'm already ''rich''. And the baker girl, well, the baker girl. Oh, just plain ridiculous! Yes, being ridiculous would be right up your alley, Marinette Dupain-Cheng! ''(Marinette stares angrily at her.)''
'''Ms. Bustier''': You know, Chloé, people are defined by their choices and what they decide to do with their lives. That's why I'm asking you to start defining yourselves by deciding what you want to do later on. It's not just about your future careers, ''(Marinette hands over a questionnaire to Chloé)'' but also what you want out of your life.
'''Mr. Damocles''': If some of you aren't sure yet about what you want to do, the Paris Career Expo will be held this weekend in various locations throughout the city! You'll meet professionals who would tell you about their careers!
'''Ms. Bustier''': ''(opens a projected map behind her)'' The document that Marinette just handed you includes a map of Paris with the locations of each career booth. ''(Marinette hands a questionnaire to Alya.)''
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]''': ''(whispers to Marinette)'' How about "superhero"? Does that count as a job? ''(They both laugh softly.)''
'''Mr. Damocles''': I would add that you should never let the context impose your costume on you. You should choose your costume yourself! Speaking of which, I, myself, would be present at the charity stand as... ''(zooms out of the door and comes back as The Owl while breathing heavily)'' the Owl! Hoo-hoo! Your daily righter of wrongs!

<poem>
''([[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] looks sadly on his career booklet.)''
'''[[Plagg]]''': Don't you wanna continue to model?
'''Adrien''': I don't think so, Plagg. I'm doing it now because my father asks me to, and I realize now I don't know what else I wanna do. I never ask myself that question.
'''Plagg''': What do you think of Cat Noir as a career?
'''Adrien''': Well, since Ladybug keeps giving Miraculous out to other holders, one day she probably won't need me anymore.
'''Plagg''': Don't worry, I will always be here for you. Hey, if you want, we could even open a cheese shop together! Just imagine... "Plagg and Cat Noir's Fromagerie"!
'''Adrien''': You can't eat cheese if you're trying to sell it.
'''Plagg''': Oh, you're right. Good point. What's a job where you get to eat cheese, then?
'''Adrien''': Why don't we start by visiting the food trade booths? ''(grabs his bag)'' Come on, Plagg, it's time to think about our future! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. Marinette continuously taps her pen on her table while her career booklet is still blank. [[Tikki]] and [[Pollen]] are beside her.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': True, Tikki. My life is complicated. But at least one thing is simple: I know what I wanna do later! No need to go to the Paris Career Expo for that!
'''Pollen''': What's a career, dear Guardian?
'''Marinette''': Oh- Well, it's... your job! Something really important that you do and gives meaning to your life!
'''[[Roaar]]''': Oh! So, your job is being the Guardian of the Miraculous!
'''[[Mullo]]''': Of course not! It's being a student!
'''[[Xuppu]]''': Not at all! It's making presents for Adrien!
'''Marinette''': Well-
'''[[Longg]]''': She said "something important", like when she crafted the big doll house to hide the [[Chinese Miracle Box|Miracle Box]]!
'''[[Wayzz]]''': Or when she designed the alarm for this room! What a masterpiece!
'''Marinette''': Sure, I love crafting but-
'''[[Ziggy]]''': You guys don't get it! What gives meaning to her life is to be in love with Adrien, or [[Luka Couffaine|Luka]], that's her job!
'''[[Fluff]]''': Luka's the one with the guitar, right?
'''[[Kaalki]]''': Her real career is being Ladybug and carve her name in history by her glorious deeds, of course!
'''[[Sass]]''': Silence, kwamis! Let's listen to the guardian. Marinette, what is the real important thing that will bring meaning to your life? 
''(Marinette becomes indecisive.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(groans)'' I don't know anymore! I guess I'm not so sure of my real job should be after all!
'''Tikki''': Maybe you should go visit a few booths at the Paris Career Expo!
'''Marinette''': I guess so, Tikki.

{{Scene|Scene: [[Île aux Cygnes]], at the Paris Career Expo. [[Alec Cataldi|Alec]] is hosting a reality TV show.}}
<poem>
'''Alec''': Welcome to "You Gotta Be Kidding"! Today, we're live at the Paris Career Expo where I'm gonna be introducing you to the most pointless jobs ever! And to start off, here's a perfect example: [[André]], the Ice Cream Maker, the ice cream man that is never around! Let me remind you how this goes: André doesn't have a shop, no one knows where he is, it takes forever to find him, and he gets to pick a flavor of your ice cream! You've gotta be kidding, André! ''(to André)'' Give me one reason why I should bother to chase after you when I could get my choice of ice cream in any corner supermarket!
''(The crowd laughs.)''
'''André''': Well, people don't just come for ice cream when they find me. They come to share their love and experience of magical moments! A supermarket cannot do what I do! I am a creator of magical moments! 
'''Alec''': "Creator of magical moments?" You've gotta be kidding! That's not a real job! 
'''André''': You're right, dear Alec. It's not a job, it's a career!
''(The crowd becomes taken aback of what André said, much to Alec's shock. Alec groans.)''
'''André''': But you found me today! I have some ice cream just for you: lime for the sourness you show on the outside, and chocolate cinnamon for the sweet dreams that still live inside of you! One day, you too will figure out what you really want to be!
''(Alec becomes mortified after receiving the ice cream from André.)''
'''Alec''': ''(to the cameraman)'' Cut! CUT! ''(he and the cameraman walk away)''
''(Marinette walks to André.)''
'''Marinette''': André, how did you know that making ice cream would be your job?
'''André''': My dear Marinette, being an ice cream man isn't a job; I used to have a job. Every morning, I would wake up and do something I didn't like doing. The only enjoyable moment for my day was when I would come home and concoct ice cream flavors that suited my mood. Until one day, in the same way that ice cream enchanted my daily life, I wondered if my true calling would be to try and enchant other people's lives, too! That's when the truly successful career is: a blend of flavors of what you can do, what you love to do, and what you can bring to others! ''(gives Marinette an ice cream)'' Strawberry and cherry for the indecisive lady, pistachio and pecan for the clear sighted young man.
'''Marinette''': Who? What young man?
'''Luka''': Hello, Marinette! ''(appears behind her)''
'''Marinette''': ''(yelps)'' Luka! ''(chuckles nervously)'' Actually, Luka and I are just, uh-
'''Luka''': Buddies! We're buddies.
'''André''': You don't necessarily have to be in love to enjoy your own scoop of magic. ''(He hands the ice cream to Luka. Luka then hands it over to Marinette.)''
'''Marinette''': Have a good day, André!
'''Luka''': ''(simultaneously)'' Have a good day!
''(Luka and Marinette walk off while eating their ice cream.)''
'''Marinette''': I'm surprised to see you here! I thought you already knew what career you're going to have.
'''Luka''': I do! I'm in charge of my school's booth where I tell people about being a maker of stringed instruments.
''(The two arrive at Luka's booth, where guitars, electric guitars, and other stringed instruments are displayed as Marinette looks fascinated. Luka grabs one of the guitars.)''
'''Luka''': What about you, Marinette? Why are you here? Aren't you on your way to become a talented fashion designer?
'''Marinette''': I don't know anymore. There's so many careers that interest me in the world of fashion, creation, decoration. You're lucky you know exactly what you wanna do.
'''Luka''': I just listen to my inner voice. ''(plays the guitar)'' This is the first instrument I made myself. ''(gives Marinette the guitar)'' It took me two years. 
'''Marinette''': Woah!
''(Alec suddenly enters the scene.)''
'''Alec''': Two whole years to make one guitar when you can download an app in two seconds to your phone? ''(plays the guitar on the guitar app on his phone)'' Yet, another pointless job! You've gotta be kidding!
''(Luka grabs a violin from his booth and walks away.)''
'''Luka''': ''(to Alec)'' Follow me.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Île aux Cygnes]], outside the Paris Career Expo. Luka, along with Marinette, Alec and his cameraman walk with him.}}
<poem>
''(Luka closes his eyes whilst feeling the breeze as Alec and his cameraman look at each other in confusion. The cameraman begins to film him. Luka raises his violin up in the air to let the wind produce music for it.)''
'''Luka''': Musical instruments fill the space and space fills the instruments. No phone in the world will ever be able to do that.
''(Alec starts to tear up and wipes his tears. He then realizes that he's on the air.)''
'''Alec''': Cut! CUT!
'''Cameraman''': Again? ''(groans)''
'''Marinette''': ''(walks to Luka)'' Woah, you definitely have a gift for finding the right words at the right time!
''(Adrien sits near the place where Luka and Marinette are.)''
'''Luka''': Adrien!
'''Marinette''': Uh- Well, most of the time.
'''Luka''': No, Adrien! He's behind you, Marinette.
'''Marinette''': ''(panics)'' How far away is he? ''(hides behind Luka)'' Did he see me already?
'''Luka''': You still haven't told him how you feel about him, right?
'''Marinette''': Umm... well... not- ''(sees Adrien feeling sad and lonely)'' Wait, he looks sad!
'''Luka''': One more reason we should go to talk to him!
''(Luka takes Marinette's hand and the two walk together to Adrien.)''
'''Luka''': Something wrong, Adrien?
'''Adrien''': ''(sighs)'' I just made the rounds to every stand at the Paris Career Expo and I still don't know what I wanna do. If I don't figure it out, my father will will decide for me once again.
''(Luka goes to sit beside Adrien as the boys look at Marinette. She hesitates for a moment but goes to sit beside Luka.)''
'''Luka''': ''(to Adrien)'' I've always felt that modelling wasn't really your true inner music.
'''Adrien''': I thought things would be simple this way, that I'd be content to do what my father told me to. Like you, Luka, who decided to be a musician like your father. Or like you, Marinette, you've always known you wanted to be a fashion designer. But actually...
'''Adrien, Luka, and Marinette''': It's way more complicated. 
''(The three look at each other and laugh.)''
'''Luka''': I don't wanna be a rock-star like my dad. I make music but that's not my career, it's my nature. What I want though, is for other people to be able to ''feel'' that music. That's why I wanted to be a stringed instrument maker; to make instruments so people can create emotions with them.
'''Marinette''': I feel like I always wanted to try new things. But the things I want to do, the things I forget to do, and the things that I just have to do, it's a lot, and I don't know.
'''Adrien''': My father arranges it all for me, but when I think about what I really actually wanna do, nothing! My mind is empty!
'''Adrien and Marinette''': I'm completely lost!
'''Luka''': There's no one way to become Marinette or to become Adrien to find out who you are. You just need to learn how to listen to your inner melody. ''(leans closer to Marinette)'' Your inner music, Marinette, at this moment, is a little bit like a brass band where... all the instruments are playing a different tune. I totally get it why you're lost. ''(The three of them laugh.)'' But if you listen a bit more closely, the music of your band is really beautiful. You just need some time to understand it. ''(leans closer to Adrien)'' Your music, Adrien, sounds like it's being muffled by someone else playing a sad piano tune, but your true melody is a happy one. Pretty rock and roll, actually. ''(stands up and grabs his violin)'' You two will eventually find what's already in front of you, but you can't hear it clearly. Just let the melody flow.
''(Luka stands from a distance and begins to play his violin. Adrien and Marinette becomes mesmerized as they smile and look at each other. They stand up and go closer to where Luka is playing the violin.)''

{{Scene|Scene: [[Île aux Cygnes]], at the Paris Career Expo. Alec continues to host "You've Gotta Be Kidding". He is now standing in front of a wig booth.}}
<poem>
'''Alec''': Who on earth would want to disguise himself with such a ridiculous fake hairdo? Louis XIV's reign is over. You've gotta be kidding!
'''Wig Seller''': A wig is never a disguise, sir. On the contrary, it is always very revealing. ''(He grabs a wig and puts it on Alec, then holds a mirror for him. Alec suddenly remembers a memory from his childhood.)''
'''Alec''': When I was a kid, I used to have long hair, but everyone made fun of me. That's why I shaved it all off. I've been making the wrong choices my whole life. My TV shows are nothing personal. I make fun of people when they make fun of me when I was a kid. ''(starts to tear up)'' I should've been the person I always wanted to be, ''(throws the wig off)'' trying to change the world instead of mocking it! ''(falls on his knees)'' I've wasted my life!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair]]. The lair window opens.}}
<poem>
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]]''': A man who has made bad choices because of pressure from others. A wasted life full of regrets and bitterness. What a perfect job for my akuma. ''(creates an akuma in his hand)'' Go and give that remorseful show host a new career that he won't regret! 
''(The akuma flies out the window.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Île aux Cygnes]], at the Paris Career Expo. The akuma lands on Alec's microphone.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Wishmaker, I am Shadow Moth. The world didn't let you realize your childhood dreams? From now on, any person you touch will have no choice but to become who they dream of being when they were a child! And when you attack Ladybug and Cat Noir, their masks will fall as their childhood dreams betray them!
'''Alec''': From now on, I'll only be who I wanna be! ''(stands up)'' And thanks to me, everyone will finally be able to do what they always wanted! ''(the purple magic engulfs him and transforms into Wishmaker)''
''(The other people in the expo runs in fear after seeing Wishmaker transformed. Wishmaker then targets a citizen.)''
'''Wishmaker''': Live your childhood dream!
'''Toy Vendor''': When I was a kid, I wanted to be [[Santa Claus|Santa]]! ''(transforms into Santa Claus while riding a sleigh)'' My dream has come true! Merry Christmas, everyone! I can make people happy even if it's not Christmas! ''(flies off as he drops gift boxes throughout Paris)''
''(Wishmaker jumps on the roof of [[Jagged Stone|Jagged Stone's]] limousine.)''
'''Jagged Stone''': Hey, I love your look! Rock and roll! ''(Wishmaker shoots him.)''
'''Wishmaker''': Live your childhood dream!
''(Jagged's childhood dream as shown in the background is him wearing a crocodile costume while chasing after a squirrel.)''
'''Jagged Stone''': Haha! I finally get to live my childhood dream! Awesome! ''(The limo driver runs off.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Exterior, [[Île aux Cygnes]]. Luka continues to play the violin.}}
<poem>
'''Jagged Stone''': ''(as a crocodile)'' Hey! Hi there, son!
'''Luka''': Dad?
'''Adrien and Marinette''': Jagged Stone?
''(A gift box falls beside Jagged. The three of them are in shock.)''
'''Toy Vendor''': ''(as Santa Claus)'' Merry Christmas, everyone! ''(continues to drop gift boxes)''
''(Adrien, Luka, and Marinette start to run.)''
'''Adrien''': This is a nightmare, right?
''(A giant robot of what appears to be like a Robo Tech Ultimate Destructor appears in front of them.)''
'''Robo Tech Ultimate Destructor''': I will turn you into mush!
'''Luka''': ''(to Adrien)'' Go hide behind that tree! ''(runs to the opposite direction with Marinette and hides her inside a portalet)'' Stay here, Marinette! ''(closes the portalet door)'' So, robot, where is this mush you were promising? ''(runs)''
''(The Robo Tech Ultimate Destructor starts to fire lasers)''
'''Marinette''': ''(to Tikki)'' I've got to protect Luka! Quick, Tikki! Spots on! ''(transforms into Ladybug)''
''(The Robo Tech Ultimate Destructor continues to fire lasers as Luka runs away from it. He falls on the ground but before the Robo Tech Ultimate Destructor fires its laser at Luka, Ladybug swings in and saves him. She brings Luka inside the expo.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(puts Luka down)'' You'll be safe here.
'''Luka''': Thank you, Ladybug!
''(Ladybug swings away. Luka runs back to the portalet where Marinette was hiding.)''
'''Luka''': Marinette! ''(calls her on the door but there was no response)'' Marinette? Huh? ''(He opens the door only to see nobody inside. He grabs his phone to call her.)'' 
'''Jagged Stone''': ''(as a crocodile, drowning in the lake)'' Help me! I don't know how to swim!
'''Luka''': Hold on, Dad! I'm coming! ''(dives into the lake)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On the rooftops. The Robo Tech Ultimate Destructor fires lasers at Ladybug.}}
<poem>
'''Robo Tech Ultimate Destructor''': I always wanted to be Roboto Tech! ''(fires lasers)''
'''Ladybug''': Yeah, but we're not living in a video game! 
''(Ladybug jumps on another rooftop to wrap her [[yo-yo]] around the gigantic robot as Cat Noir arrives and extends his stick to push the robot as it falls.)''
'''Robo Tech Ultimate Destructor''': Destroyer of... Dreams! ''(falls and powers off)''
''(Cat Noir leaps to the rooftops to join Ladybug.)''
'''Cat Noir''': He's mistaken dreams from reality!
'''Wishmaker''': Live your childhood dream! ''(fires his staff on Captain Hessenpy)'' Live your childhood dream!
''(Captain Hessenpy's dream shows him as a child playing a fire truck with a cowboy riding on it.)''
'''[[List of minor characters/Humans#Hessenpy|Captain Hessenpy]]''': When I was a child, I wanted to be a fireman ''and'' a cowboy! ''(a flash of light appears and he gets a horse with the colors of a fire truck)'' Wow! I knew it was possible! ''(the horse neighs and gallops)''
''(Wishmaker prepares to fire once again but Ladybug manages to stop him by lassoing her yo-yo on his arm.)''
'''Wishmaker''': Why are you trying to stop me? I'm making people happy!
'''Ladybug''': Yes, but your doing it against their will without permission!
'''Wishmaker''': I want people to live their dreams!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(annoyed)'' Would you really call this a dream? 
''(A huge cucumber rolls behind him.)''
'''Cucumber''': Look! Look! I'm a cucumber! Woo-hoo-hoo!
''(Wishmaker twirls which sends Ladybug getting pulled to the ground. She lands on her feet and stands beside Cat Noir.)''
'''Wishmaker''': Try me, let me be your wishmaker! ''(fires shooting stars at Ladybug and Cat Noir as they block it with their weapons)''
'''Ladybug''': If we get hit, he'll reveal our secret identities!
'''Cat Noir''': What do you mean, m'lady?
'''Ladybug''': When I was six, I wanted to be the Knitting Fairy, and the Knitting Fairy didn't wear a mask!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(pulls Ladybug beside him and protects her)'' The Knitting Fairy? Seriously?
''(The two of them leap to the rooftops as they run away from Wishmaker.)''
'''Ladybug''': What about you? What did you wanna be when you were young? ''(Cat Noir didn't answer)'' Hah! You were making fun of me but you're too embarrassed to tell me!
''(As they run on the rooftop, Wishmaker jumps in front of them and fires shooting stars at them but they were able to dodge them. Ladybug and Cat Noir continue to escape Wishmaker.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Actually, I don't know what I wanted to be when I was a kid.
'''Ladybug''': You probably wanted to be a magician or a fireman! 
''(She pulls Cat Noir towards her with her yo-yo to keep him away from Wishmaker. The villain tries to hit them yet Ladybug and Cat Noir continues to dodge them.)''
'''Cat Noir''': I swear, I can't remember!
'''Ladybug''': You must've just forgotten! ''(They both jump to the other side of the wall.)'' If Wishmaker ever hits one of us, we're gonna need a second chance!
'''Cat Noir''': Viperion?
'''Ladybug''': I think we need the insurance!
'''Cat Noir''': You go, I'll cover you!
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir split as Ladybug goes to find Luka.)''

{{Scene|Scene: Exterior, [[Île aux Cygnes]]. Luka and crocodile Jagged lie side-by-side on the sand.}}
<poem>
'''Luka''': But Dad, crocodiles know how to swim.
'''Jagged Stone''': ''(as a crocodile)'' I didn't when I was a kid.
''(Ladybug swings in the scene.)''
'''Ladybug''': Hello there, Croco-Jagged! I need a word with your son if that's okay with you.
'''Jagged Stone''': ''(as a crocodile)'' Rock and roll, Ladybug!

{{Scene|Scene: On the rooftops. Ladybug gives Luka the [[Snake Miraculous]] as Sass emerges from the bracelet.}}

'''Sass''': Nice to see you again, Luka.
'''Luka''': You too, Sass.
'''Ladybug''': Use your power now. If Cat Noir and I get hit, you must come back to this ''exact'' moment.
'''Luka''': Understood, Ladybug.

'''Viperion''': [[Second Chance]]! 
'''Ladybug''': No one can know our secret identities!

'''Ladybug''': ''(smiles and uses her powers)'' [[Lucky Charm]]! ''([[List of Lucky Charm objects|a dinosaur plush toy]] appears)'' A dino-huggie?
'''Viperion''': Saving the world with a stuffed animal? I like that idea!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On the streets of Paris. Cat Noir and Wishmaker continue to battle.}}
<poem>
'''Wishmaker''': Are you sure you don't want me to make your childhood dream come true? ''(fires a shooting star)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(blocks the shooting star)'' Don't waste your breath! I didn't have any!
'''Wishmaker''': Every child has a dream!
'''Cat Noir''': Maybe not everyone!
'''Wishmaker''': You just need to get your memory back. Just let me touch you, and your childhood dream will be revealed to you! ''(Cat Noir gasps)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' What a brilliant idea, Wishmaker! Make his dreams come true and show me Cat Noir's true face!
(Ladybug and Viperion join the battle before Cat Noir gets hit by Wishmaker's shooting star.)'' 
'''Viperion''': Watch out, Cat Noir! ''(drags Cat Noir with him on the ground to protect him)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(She looks around and sees Wishmaker, Viperion, and some people from afar. She raises the dino plushie above her head.)'' Does this stuffed animal mean anything to you?
''(The citizens shake their head and Ladybug returns to battle. Wishmaker fires a shooting star but was deflected by Viperion. The shooting star then heads toward Ladybug.)''
'''Man with a red beret''': ''(points at the dino plushie)'' It's a dino huggie!
''(Ladybug gets hit by the shooting star.)
'''Wishmaker''': Live your childhood dream! 
''(Ladybug's dream shows six-year-old Marinette drawing the Knitting Fairy on a piece of paper. She then transforms into Marinette, wearing a costume as the Knitting Fairy.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(as the Knitting Fairy)'' Awesome! I always wanted to be the Knitting Fairy in real life!
'''Viperion''': ''(in shock)'' M-Marinette?
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Ladybug is Adrien's classmate Marinette? At last! At long last!
''(Viperion is still mortified after discovering Ladybug's secret identity and uses his power to revert time.) 
'''Viperion''': Second Chance! 
''(Time reverts back with when him and Ladybug are on the rooftop during the time he first activated his power.)''
'''Ladybug''': No one can know our secret identities! Lucky Charm! ''(a dino plushie appears)'' A dino huggie?
'''Viperion''': I've already got the first part of the solution!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' What a brilliant idea, Wishmaker! Make his dreams come true!
''(Cat Noir and Wishmaker battle again. Viperion arrives in time.)''
'''Viperion''': Cat Noir, duck! 
''(Ladybug lands beside them and runs to the citizen wearing a red beret.)''
'''Man with a red beret''': Hey, it's a dino huggie!
''(Wishmaker fires a shooting star at Cat Noir and gets hit, revealing his childhood dream.)''
'''Wishmaker''': Live your childhood dream!
''(Cat Noir shows his point of view as a baby while his parents [[Emilie Agreste|Emilie]] and Gabriel are looking at him, smiling. Viperion looks from behind and becomes mortified yet again after discovering Cat Noir's secret identity.)
'''Adrien''': When I was a kid, I always wanted what my parents wanted me to be!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(mortified after discovering Adrien is Cat Noir)'' My son?!
'''Man with a red beret''': When I was a kid, I wanted to be in the dino huggie gang!
'''Ladybug''': Then you're the answer in defeating Wishmaker!
'''Viperion''': I'm sorry, Ladybug, but this isn't the right moment yet! Second Chance! ''(uses his ability once more)''
''(Time reverts back once again with when Viperion and Ladybug are on the rooftop during the time he first activated his power.)''
'''Ladybug''': No one can know our secret identities! 
'''Viperion''': I promise you ''that'' won't happen! 
'''Ladybug''': Lucky Charm! ''(a dino plushie appears)'' A dino huggie?
'''Viperion''': The stuffed animal is for a man with a red hat. His childhood dream was to become a dino huggie.
'''Ladybug''': Got it! ''(They jump off the rooftop.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' What a brilliant idea, Wishmaker! 
'''Viperion''': Watch out, Cat Noir! 
''(Cat Noir is about to get hit by Wishmaker's shooting star but Viperion was able to deflect it.)''
'''Man with a red beret''': It's a dino huggie!
''(Wishmaker's shooting star now hits the man with a red beret. Once hit, he turns into a giant dino huggie.)
'''Man with a red beret''': ''(as a huge dino plushie)'' Wow! I'm a dino huggie!
'''Ladybug''': Look! Wishmaker needs a big dino hug!
''(The big dino huggie jumps behind Wishmaker before he could fire yet another shooting star.)
'''Man with a red beret''': ''(as a huge dino plushie)'' Big hug! Big hug! Big hug! Big hug! Pretty hug! Pretty hug!
''(Wishmaker continues to fire shooting stars at the big dino plushie but does it no harm.)''
'''Wishmaker:''' Noooo!
''(The big dino plushie grabs Wishmaker and hugs him tight, disarming him. Ladybug takes the opportunity to grab Wishmaker's staff with her yo-yo and throws it to Cat Noir.)''
'''Ladybug''': Cat Noir, now! ''(throws Wishmaker's staff at him)''
'''Cat Noir''': [[Cataclysm]]! ''(breaks Wishmaker's staff as the akuma emerges from it and Wishmaker detransforms into Alec, who is still being hugged by the giant dino plushie)''
'''Ladybug''': No more evil-doing for you, little akuma! ''(opens her yo-yo)'' Time to de-evilize! ''(captures the akuma)'' Gotcha! ''(opens her yo-yo once more, releasing the purified akuma)'' Bye-bye, little butterfly! [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]! ''(She throws the dino-plushie in the air and fixes all the damage caused by Wishmaker. She opens her yo-yo again to grab a magical charm for Alec. She places it in his hand.)'' Alec, this magical charm will remind you that our negative emotions make us vulnerable. I'm sure it'll help you to stay positive.
'''Alec''': Thank you, Ladybug!
'''Ladybug, Cat Noir, and Viperion''': Pound it!

'''Ladybug''': Thank you, Luka. Thanks to you, our secret identities were preserved and no one discovered who Cat Noir and I really are. ''(about to swing but stops)'' Uhh... not even you, right?
'''Luka''': Not even me. Luckily, Wishmaker never hit you or Cat Noir.
''(Ladybug swings away, leaving Luka alone who feels sad that he lied that he knows Ladybug and Cat Noir's secret identities.)''

''(Luka goes to the cubicle where Marinette was hiding. He is about to knock but Marinette opens the door first.)''
'''Marinette''': Luka! Thank you for hiding me in here.
'''Luka''': Uh- It was nothing, Marinette! You know you can always count on me!
'''Adrien''': ''(runs to join Luka and Marinette)'' You guys are okay!
'''Luka''': We're all okay, thanks to Ladybug and Cat Noir.

<poem>
'''Adrien''': I may not remember my childhood dreams, but that's okay! It's time to focus on the future and find my inner music, like Luka said! Plagg? What are you doing?
'''Plagg''': ''(listens to a round block of cheese with a little stethoscope)'' I'm curious to hear what a camembert concerto sounds like!
''(Adrien laughs.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. Marinette continuously taps her pen once again.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(sighs)'' You know what? I decided that I'm gonna do it all! ''(stands up)'' I'll be Ladybug, I'll design clothes, jewelry, furniture, space rockets, I'll be Luka's bestfriend, and I will ''love'' Adrien!
'''Fluff''': But how will you do it all at the same time?
'''Marinette''': I... don't know how... yet. But yes, I can do this!
'''Alec''': ''(on TV)'' Welcome to "Live Your Childhood Dream"! And now, we're gonna ''love'' one another, starting with everyone loving themselves! Because how are you gonna love other people if you don't love yourself? Welcome to "Live Your Childhood Dream"!
