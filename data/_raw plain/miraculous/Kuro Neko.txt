<poem>
'''Nadja''': ''(from TV)'' This morning, when a temperamental baby became akumatized, our reporter Clara Contard got a first hand of all the action.
''([[August|Gigantitan]] cries while holding [[Clara Contard]].)'' 
'''Nadja''': ''(from TV)'' Ladybug and her courageous team were there to save the day.
''([[Nino Lahiffe|Carapace]] captures Gigantitan with his [[Shell-ter]].)''
'''[[Max Kanté|Pegasus]]''': ''(from TV)'' [[Voyage]]!
'''[[Rose Lavillant|Pigella]]''': ''(from TV)'' [[Gift]]! ''(Gigantitan sees his [[List of minor characters/Humans#August's mother|mother]].)''
'''Gigantitan''': ''(from TV)'' Mommy!
'''Carapace''': ''(from TV)'' Unshield!
'''[[Zoé Lee|Vesperia]]''': ''(from TV)'' [[Venom]]!
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]]''': ''(from TV; captures the [[akuma]])'' Gotcha! ''(Gigantitan turns back into August.)''
'''Clara''': ''(from TV)'' Thanks, Ladybug!
'''August's mom''': ''(from TV)'' August! ''(She picks him up and carries him away.)''
'''Clara''': ''(from TV)'' By the way, where's Cat Noir? You've saved Paris without him quite a few times recently. Are you two at odds with each other?
'''Carapace, Pegasus, Vesperia and Pigella''': ''(from TV)'' Pound it!
'''Ladybug''': ''(from TV)'' Of course not, it's just that... umm, he's a partner like any other! The most important is to pick the best superheroes for each mission, with or without Chat Noir. No matter what, we've got a great team and we'll always be here to save Paris.
''(Adrien is shocked.)''
'''Adrien''': ''(turns off the TV and sighs)'' "A partner like any other..."
'''[[Plagg]]''': Oh, don't make a big stink about this, Adrien! Look, people always pretend like camembert is just like all the other cheeses, when they know perfectly well that it's the best of all! Especially when we forget where you put it for a few months, and it's all runny and moldy—
''(He heard lasers blasting outside.)'' 
'''Plagg''': Perfect! Now's your chance to show 'em all who's the big cheese on the plate. ''(gulp)'' Camembert, transform! I mean Adrien, transform!
'''Adrien''': It's useless.
'''Plagg''': ''(dragging Adrien by his finger)'' No, it's not! It's use''ful''! Ladybug needs you, come on let's go!
'''Adrien''': Okay. Plagg, claws out.

{{Scene|Scene: Rooftops. Cat Noir leaps and looks around.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': ''(from afar)'' [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]!
''(Cat Noir sighs and heads towards the magical ladybugs.)''
'''Ladybug, Ryuko, Polymouse, King Monkey and Purple Tigress''': Pound it!
'''Ryuko''': Hey, Cat Noir!
'''Polymouse, King Monkey and Purple Tigress''': Hey!
'''Cat Noir''': Hey, guys!
'''King Monkey''': How's it going, dude?
''(The heroes' [[Miraculouses]] beep.)''
'''Ladybug''': Come on, guys! Hurry up before you all detransform. I'll meet you at rendezvous points.
''(The heroes jump away in different directions, and Ladybug starts typing something on her [[Yo-yo]].)''
'''Cat Noir''': Hey! Meow are you, m'lady?
'''Ladybug''': Great, thanks, but I gotta go retrieve all these Miraculous.
'''Cat Noir''': I could hand you a paw to help save time.
'''Ladybug''': Thanks, kitty cat, but it's a guardian's job to do it.
'''Cat Noir''': I know who some of them are, remember? I was there when you first gave them their Miraculous!
'''Ladybug''': You don't even know where their rendezvous points are, I don't have time to—
'''Cat Noir''': Playing cat and mouse is my forte, you know—
'''Ladybug''': ''(yelling)'' If you wanna save me time, stop wasting it in the first place!
''(Cat Noir gasps. As Ladybug swings away, Cat Noir clenches his fist.)''
'''Cat Noir''': And take my Miraculous back when you're done! 
'''Ladybug''': ''(swinging away)'' Okay, whatever, see you later!
'''Cat Noir''': I won't waste your time anymore, I promise. Claws in. ''(detransforms to Adrien)'' 
'''Adrien''': I'm sorry, Plagg.
'''Plagg''': Woah woah woah, hang on!
''(Cut to Ladybug.)''
'''Ladybug''': What does he mean "take back his Miraculous"?
'''Adrien''': I just can't do this anymore. I give up... on everything. Even you.
'''Plagg''': You can't do that!
''(Adrien takes his ring off, and it goes into its charged form.)''
''(Cut to Ladybug.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(gasps)'' No, he wouldn't! Don't move, I'll be right back!
''(King Monkey detransforms, and Kim is left hanging on the building.)''
'''Kim''': You mean don't move at all or can I still move a little?
''(Ladybug swings back.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(looking around)'' Cat Noir? Cat Noir? ''(She gasps upon finding the [[Cat Miraculous]].)'' Oh no! Cat Noir...
'''Ryuko''': ''(over earpiece)'' Ladybug, we were supposed to be behind the fountain.
'''Polymouse''': ''(over earpiece)'' I'm about to detransform. Should I feed my kwami, or will you do that?
'''Ladybug''': I... ''(She puts the ring in her yo-yo.)'' Stay in position, I'm on my way! ''(She swings away.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. She contemplates the Cat Miraculous, surrounded by the [[kwamis]].}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': What's gotten into him? I didn't do anything.
'''Plagg''': Didn't do anything? Well yeah, you did! You've been neglecting a very classy piece of camemebert on your plate for too long! And as a result it got runny, and moldy!
'''Ladybug''': What? Cat Noir never gave me any camembert.
'''Plagg''': Of course not, Cat Noir is the camembert! For a while now, you've been neglecting this camembert— I mean Cat Noir, and going on adventures with the all other cheeses!
'''Ladybug''': But he should be happy about it, it gives him more time off.
'''Plagg''': Cat Noir doesn't wanna have time off, Ladybug! He is in love with you! And your persistent calling on other heroes has broken his heart.
'''Ladybug''': I'm really sorry if Cat Noir is hurt, but I'm doing my best as a guardian.
'''Plagg''': ''(sighs)'' I know. Just... give me the Miraculous. I'll give it back to him, cheer him up, we'll chow down on some grilled mimolette sandwiches and everything will go back to normal.
'''Ladybug''': It's useless. The problem is that Cat Noir is in love with me. And since I can't do anything about that, I'll keep on breaking his heart over and over again. Maybe Cat Noir is right. We should split.
''(The kwamis gasp.)''
'''Plagg''': Woaaah! Not so fast! May I remind you that Cat Noir's a very competent superhero and that your powers complement each other?
'''Ladybug''': I know I can't do it without a Cat Noir... So I'll just have to choose another one, who won't be in love with me!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. He sadly throws all photos of Ladybug from his trophy and cheeses into the trash, then does the same to the sock puppet Plagg.}}
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room.}}
<poem>
'''Plagg''': Another Cat Noir? What do you mean another Cat Noir?
'''Ladybug''': I'm going to choose a new Cat Noir myself. One who won't be in love with me. And since I'll know who he is, I can call on him whenever I need him. ''(She jumps to the [[Marinette's balcony|balcony]].)''
'''Plagg''': Woah woah woah! You mean you'll know who he is? You'll know his secret identity?
'''Ladybug''': You're right! I can't do that! If I know who Cat Noir is and Shadow Moth akumatizes me, he'll know where to find Cat Noir and he'll capture both our Miraculous! He'll merge them together and make his wish come true, and then the whole world will turn into whatever he wants!
''(She envisions Shadow Moth with the two Miraculouses surrounding the globe and saying "Finally!".)''
'''Plagg''': See? You can't do that, so come on, give me back the Miraculous. I'll just tell him to erase you from his heart, and everything will be fine.
'''Ladybug''': You really think he's capable of that?
'''Plagg''': I sure hope so.

{{Scene|Scene: Next morning. Marinette's room. The kwamis are asleep while Marinette continues trying to solve the issue.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': I've got it! ''(This awakens the kwamis. She traces lines on her plan.)'' I meet him anonymously and make sure he's already got a girlfriend and that for real he thinks Ladybug is cool and all, but just like a friend. Then, I mail him the Miraculous and— ah, shoot! I need his address to mail him the Miraculous and his name too! ''(She scrunches up a piece of paper and tosses it into a large pile of paper which suffered the same fate.)'' Curse you Cat Noir! This is all your fault! ''(groans)'' Why do you have to be in love with me, huh? What am I supposed to do now?
'''Plagg''': ''(to Tikki)'' And yet she loves my holder.
'''Tikki''': ''(to Plagg)'' And he loves Ladybug.
'''Plagg''': Sugarcube! I know how to fix this and get them back together! But I'm gonna need your help.
''(He whispers something to her.)''

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Nathalie]] walks in using a special device.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': ''(coughs)'' Adrien, you're late for breakfa— ''(She sees him turned to a side in bed and gasps.)'' Adrien? Are you okay?
'''Adrien''': I'm fine, Nathalie. I just don't feel like going to school. ''(He covers his head with the blanket.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Gabriel's atelier]].}}
<poem>
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel]]''': When is his next photoshoot?
'''Nathalie''': In three days.
'''Gabriel''': He will feel better by then. He's an Agreste.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. She is psychotically scribbling over a photo of Cat Noir.}}
<poem>
'''Tikki''': But I can't lie to Marinette!
'''Plagg''': Who said anything about lying? I'm just asking you to smile and nod! ''(He flies over to a growling Marinette and clears his throat.)'' My dear guardian, you cannot continue keeping both the Miraculous of destruction and creation under the same roof. If Shadow Moth ever found that out and came here...
''(The vision of Shadow Moth reappears saying "Finally!" yet again. Marinette pushes it up.)''
'''Marinette''': I know that, but I can't figure out how to recruit a new Cat Noir.
'''Plagg''': Because you can't know his identity, right?
'''Marinette''': ''(groans and falls down, slumping)''
'''Plagg''': Well, dry your eyes! We've found the solution! Tikki's the one who reminded me of it actually.
'''Marinette''': ''(looks at Tikki in surprise)''
''(Tikki nods nervously.)''
'''Plagg''': It's true that my owner is fantastic, but there is one other boy. Master Fu hesitated between the two of them when he was choosing Cat Noir, and Tikki and I liked him even better. ''(Tikki nods again.)'' He'd make a perfect Cat Noir! And more importantly, he's not in love with you, and I mean not at all!
'''Marinette''': How can you be sure of that?
'''Plagg''': Because... it's a kwami power! ''(Tikki continues nodding awkwardly nodding.)'' And, since I can go and present the Miraculous to him myself, you'll never know who he is! That way, you'll have a new Cat Noir, who's not in love with you at all and everything will be perfect!
'''Marinette''': ''(looking at the Miraculous)'' But... isn't it kind of risky to leave you on your own outside without a holder with your own Miraculous? What if Shadow Moth would capture you?
''(The vision reappears, but Plagg shoves it up before it finishes.)''
'''Plagg''': Shadow Moth doesn't even know that Cat Noir has given his Miraculous back!
'''Marinette''': We have to agree that this new Cat Noir would be up to the challenge, right? We're spending time together, so I have to be able to get along with him. He'll have to be nice, generous—
'''Plagg''': Hang on, I'm talking about a top shelf Cat Noir here. Brave but calm, and rational too! As strong as he is intelligent, thoughtful, and trustworthy. I promise you, take the time to get to know him and you'll see he's the Cat Noir of your dreams!
'''Marinette''': ''(skeptically)'' Are you trying to pull one over on me Plagg?
'''Plagg''': Oh, Sugarcube, tell her! She can trust me, can't she?
''(Tikki nods, failing to be genuine. Marinette looks at her and back at the ring.)''
'''Marinette''': Okay then.
'''Plagg''': ''(grabs the ring as the kwamis exclaim)'' I promise you won't regret it!
''(Marinette looks at Tikki one last time, who continues to nod.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room.}}
<poem>
''(Adrien is on the couch, playing a videogame, or rather running into a brick wall as the playable character. Plagg knocks on the window.)''
'''Adrien:''' Plagg? ''(He opens the window.)'' If you're here for your cheese it's over there.
'''Plagg:''' Not at all! I've got a great plan to get us back to- ''(gasps)'' No! My favorite old honey tomme cheese! Mushed into fresh goat cheese... well, we'll deal with that later. I'm just gonna blame this on your recent psychological state. Listen, I have Ladybug believing that I found a perfect new holder for Cat Noir. And this new holder is you! ''(He looks at the screen and sees the character constantly running into a wall. He flies in front of Adrien.)''  Come on! What do you say to your good old kwami buddy who you thought you'd never see again? ''(He flings the ring at Adrien, whose depressed expression doesn't change.)'' Hey, you! Enough with the talking gloomy act! You and me, just like before!
'''Adrien:''' I can't be just like before, Plagg. If I become Cat Noir again, Ladybug will just end up rejecting me, over and over.
''(Plagg looks at the rubbish bin and back at Adrien.)''
'''Plagg:''' I get it. It's hard to be thrown out with the old cheese rinds. But I'm not talking about being the Cat Noir you used to be! ''(He pulls in a drawing of Cat Noir in a superhero cape and places the ring in Adrien's hands.)'' You're gonna be the new Cat Noir! Wait until you see how brilliant this is! After all the time I've spent with Ladybug, I know exactly what she's looking for! So you and I are gonna whip up a tailor-made Cat Noir! So perfect that believe me, she'll never forget to call on you for help again!
'''Adrien:''' ''(looking down at the ring)'' But as soon as I transform into Cat Noir, she'll know it's me.
'''Plagg:''' ''(drawing over the board)'' Nope! Because when your personality changes, your costume changes too! Up until now, whenever you transform into Cat Noir, you didn't think about it, it was natural. And what came out was this Cat Noir. ''(He crosses out the picture of a goofy Cat Noir.)'' Not at all what Ladybug wants! But if you focus hard, you can be a completely different Cat Noir!
'''Adrien:''' You really think so?
'''Plagg:''' Of course! Concentrate.
''(Adrien puts the ring on, and Plagg giggles. Adrien starts concentrating.)''
'''Plagg:''' Alright, you're like a little ball of fresh curd, that doesn't know yet, that it can be something more than a camembert! But if you think hard about what you're doing, if you age your crust and choose the right fermentation, you can be any cheese you want.
'''Adrien:''' Plagg, claws out! ''(He transforms into Cat Noir.)''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(groans)'' Claws in.
'''Plagg:''' Okay... we've got some work to do.
''(Sometime later in the same room, Adrien with a Cat mask practices arrival poses while Plagg in a Ladybug mask denies his first attempts and approves of the third, calmer one.)''
''(Adrien is deciding between two masks for his new suit, and Plagg places one on a sketch.)''
'''Plagg:''' ''(writing on a whiteboard)'' Serious Cat? A little too direct. Silky Kitten? Hmmm.. too cutzy. Night Whiskers?
'''Adrien:''' That's pretty ''paw-sitive'', isn't it?
'''Plagg:''' ''(strictly)'' What did we say about cat puns?
'''Adrien:''' ''(sighs)'' No more cat puns under any circumstances.
'''Plagg:''' You know how to be serious, like when you're with your father and Nathalie. Just be like that! ''(He straightens Adrien up.)'' Mm-hmm. Perfect. And I guarantee that Ladybug will not be able to do it without you.
''(Plagg and Adrien come closer to the whiteboard, and time passes quickly.)''
'''Plagg:''' Kitty Kitty.. Cat of the Night... Citizen Cat... Obscure Kitty... Super Cat... Black Kitty... Feline Kitty... Cat Man... Adrien, I think we finally got it.
'''Adrien:''' Plagg, claws out!

'''Ladybug:''' ''(to herself)'' This time, no more improvisations. The rules will be clear from the start. I'll be firm with him right away.
''(Cat Walker jumps from behind. She is startled.)''
'''Cat Walker:''' ''(slightly bowing)'' Good evening, Ladybug. I'm Cat Walker.
'''Ladybug:''' Purr-fectly delighted!
'''Cat Walker:''' ''(calmly)'' Likewise.
'''Ladybug:''' You.. don't burst out laughing, don't you think that's funny?
'''Cat Walker:''' I find the play on words nicely done. Plagg told me you were exceptional and he is good as his word. If you'd like, next time, I will laugh.
'''Ladybug:''' ''(nervously)'' Oh, no, don't, I- You don't have to force yourself to laugh. ''(She giggles and then clears her throat and starts pacing.)'' So tell me, Cat Walker, how old are you? Do you have brothers and sisters? Any hobbies in particular?
'''Cat Walker:''' Answering your questions would risk revealing my secret identity.
'''Ladybug:''' Wow, you really are perfect. Um- I mean- your answer was perfect. Let's see how well you think on your feet. Say, a supervillain shows up and you know nothing about them. What would be your first reaction? A, you rush towards them and cataclysm them, B, you-
'''Cat Walker:''' ''(looking to a side and preparing his [[staff]])'' First I get to a safe place to observe them. And that's what you should do too, Ladybug.
''([[Kuro Neko (sentimonster)|Kuro Neko]] is then seen using the [[Tour Montparnasse]] as a scratching post.)''
'''Ladybug:''' You know, I guess there's no more time for chit-chat. Let's get to work right now! ''(They jump closer to Kuro Neko. Ladybug sees its bell.)'' No, Cat Noir, stop! This is ridiculous!
''(Kuro Neko notices the heroes and attacks them, and they jump and run away.)''
'''Cat Walker:''' You think that's Cat Noir?
'''Ladybug:''' Of course it's Cat Noir! He must've been akumatized because he regrets having given up his Miraculous!
'''Cat Walker:''' ''(hesitating)'' What if it's not Cat Noir?
'''Ladybug:''' Leave this to me, Cat Walker. I know him really well. ''(She swings away but bumps into the skyscraper.)''
'''Cat Walker:''' Ladybug!
''(Kuro Neko tries to scratch her, and she struggles to keep hold its paw.)''
'''Ladybug:''' I'm so sorry, Cat Noir! I didn't realize how broken-hearted you were over this!

'''Shadow Moth:''' Cat Noir? What is she talking about? Kuro Neko, be a nice kitty cat. Get me Ladybug's Miraculous...
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Tour Montparnasse.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth:''' ''(from lair)'' ...and you'll be free to play forever.
''(Cat Walker catches Ladybug and frees her from Kuro Neko's grip. The sentimonster looks around and walks away on two legs.)''
'''Cat Walker:''' If that was Cat Noir, don't you think he'd talk to you?
'''Ladybug:''' It's true, he usually does talk a lot more. He must be really upset that I found someone to take his place!
''(Cat Walker has an ironic expression. He then looks at Kuro Neko.)''
'''Cat Walker:''' With that slot on his back, he looks more like a piggy bank, don't you think?
'''Ladybug:''' You'll see once we deakumatize him. ''(She runs towards Kuro Neko.)'' Cataclysm his bell, I'm sure that's where the akuma is!
'''Cat Walker:''' Hang on! ''(follows her)'' Ladybug, what if that's a [[Sentimonster|sentimonster]]? If I use my power on him, he'll lose control and become more dangerous!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(stopping)'' You're right! Wow, Plagg really took his job as a coach seriously! ''(Cat Walker raises his brow and continues running.)'' But trust me, I know Cat Noir- ''(She realizes he left.)'' Hey, what are you doing?!
'''Cat Walker:''' Kitty, kitty! Meow, meow, kitty! ''(Kuro Neko starts chasing him and meowing. Cat Walker makes it to a park and takes some grass.)'' This should do. Meow, meow, meow! ''(makes pushy noises)'' That's right, come here. ''(Ladybug lands on a roof nearby. Kuro Neko prepares to attack Cat Walker, but he proceeds calmly, even rolling in the grass.)'' Mmm, this smells good!
''(Kuro Neko starts eating grass, and Cat Walker jumps up to Ladybug.)''
'''Ladybug:''' What's he doing?
'''Cat Walker:''' Cats sometimes eat grass, it helps them spit out their hairballs. ''(watching Kuro Neko)'' 
'''Ladybug:''' Cat Noir loves acting like a clown, but he wouldn't go so far as to eat real grass.
'''Cat Walker:''' ''(cringes)'' What I mean is you're right to doubt, and I agree with you. Until we know for sure whether we're dealing with a sentimonster, someone who's been akumatized, we shouldn't make any brash decisions. ''(Kuro Neko leaps away.)'' Let's find out more.
'''Ladybug:''' ''(looks down sadly)''
'''Cat Walker:''' ''(nervously correcting himself)'' I'm only saying this because you asked me to think on my feet, you know? But you're the Guardian and whatever your plan is, I'll follow it.
'''Ladybug:''' ''(frustrated)'' You were right from the start, of course that's not Cat Noir!
'''Cat Walker:''' It's completely understandable why you think that.
'''Ladybug:''' Yeah, but hello? I just confused my former partner with a giant piggy bank! I didn't see he was hurt and couldn't stop him from leaving either. I must be the worst Guardian ever!
'''Cat Walker:''' There's nothing wrong with you. Maybe the boy who was Cat Noir was more sensitive than it seemed. But his feelings for you shouldn't force you to pay more attention to him than to others. You take care of everybody equally, Ladybug. ''(He gets up and reaches his hand out.)'' Now I want to take care of you.
''(Ladybug blushes and takes his hand. Kuro Neko plays with the [[Roue de Paris]] in the background.)''
'''Ladybug:''' Uh.. thanks.
'''Cat Walker:''' Shall we? ''(She nods.)''
''(Ladybug and Cat Walker fight Kuro Neko. It swings Ladybug away with her yo-yo after she tied its paw and starts fighting off helicopters. Cat Walker jumps onto it, grabs the yo-yo and hands it over to Ladybug.)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(stuttering)'' Thanks for being so charming with me- oh, uh, what I meant was-
'''Cat Walker:''' Lucky Charm?
'''Ladybug:''' What?
'''Cat Walker:''' You meant that you need your yo-yo to call up your Lucky Charm, right? ''(pointing at Kuro Neko)'' 
'''Ladybug:''' Yes, right! ''(giggles)''
<center>'''''[Superpower sequence]''<br />Ladybug:''' [[Lucky Charm]]!<br />''(She gets [[List of Lucky Charm objects#Season 4|a parachute]].)''</center>
'''Ladybug:''' A parachute? ''(She looks around, but her gaze keeps landing on Cat Walker. She rubs her eyes but still can't look away.)''
'''Cat Walker:''' Are you okay?
'''Ladybug:''' ''(turning away, flustered)'' Uh.. yes, but I'm gonna need you. Use the parachute to blind the cat, and I'll... snatch his bell with my yo-yo.
''(Cat Walker covers Kuro Neko's eyes,  who falls, so he moves Ladybug to a side.)''
'''Cat Walker:''' Watch out!
''(Kuro Neko removes the parachute and leaves.)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(springing onto her feet)'' Let's not panic, I must've made a mistake. Let's try something else. ''(She is still unable to see anything she needs except Cat Walker. She turns away again.)'' Uh... okay, I think.. I know what to do. At least I hope so...

'''Ladybug:''' Right! Make sure not to touch anything other than the bell!
'''Cat Walker:''' [[Cataclysm]]!

'''Cat Walker:''' I'll go and recharge my Cataclysm. I might be able to break the object controlling it.

''(She lays out the parachute, and the worker unloads grass from a truck. Kuro Neko pounces in, and the worker drives away, scared.)''
'''Ladybug:''' Come on, you big kitty! It's time to spit up that hairball!
''(Ladybug throws the parachute into the sentimonster's mouth, and it spits out the grass and Rythm.)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(crouching)'' Could you please give me your piggy bank?
'''Rythm:''' ''(holding the piggy bank tighter)'' No way! All the money that I saved up to buy kitty toys for my cat is in here!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(looks at Kuro Neko; surprised)'' Uh... him?
'''Rythm:''' ''(on the verge of tears)'' No, my cat's ran away. So Shadow Moth promised he'd give me the biggest kitty in the world to replace him but this cat is mean.. and he doesn't listen. I want my kitty cat! ''(She starts crying. Cat Walker overhears this and leaps away.)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(stroking her head)'' You know what? I lost my kitty cat too. And I miss him a lot. We just need to break your piggy bank long enough for the big cat to stop being naughty, and then my magic ladybugs will fix it. And that way, when you find your cat, you can still buy him the best toys in the world.
'''Rythm:''' Okay.
''(She gets up and smashes the piggy bank, releasing the [[amok]] and Kuro Neko disappears.)''
'''Ladybug:''' Time to de-evilize! ''(She captures the amok.)'' Gotcha! Bye-bye, little feather.
<center>'''''[Superpower sequence]''<br />Ladybug:''' Miraculous Ladybug!</center>
''(The magical ladybugs repair the Roue de Paris, Tour Montparnasse and cars at the Eiffel Tower. A "meow" can be heard.)''
'''Rytym:''' ''(gasps)'' My kitten! ''(She runs over to Cat Walker, who is holding her kitten, hugs her pet and plays with it.)''
'''Ladybug and Cat Walker:''' You were perfect. No, you were perfect. ''(They laugh.)''
'''Ladybug:''' But, Cat Noir...
'''Cat Walker:''' ...is not me. Plagg will give you the ring back.
'''Ladybug:''' And.. he'll send it back to its previous owner.
'''Cat Walker:''' ''(bows)'' Nice to have met you, Ladybug. Cat Noir... is a very lucky guy.
''(Rythm comes back, laughing and playing with her kitten, as Cat Walker jumps away. Rythm and Ladybug look at each other, grab one another's hand and walk away.)''

'''Cat Walker:''' Claws in.
'''Adrien:''' ''(stretching)'' Your great plan didn't really work out, Plagg.
'''Plagg:''' Are you kidding? It worked better than if it actually worked! ''(He reaches a piece of Camembert out of the bin.)'' So long, serious cat, we're finally gonna be super cool cat again!
'''Adrien:''' But what if I can't do it? Become the old Cat Noir again?
'''Plagg:''' Don't worry about that! Just be yourself and he'll be back in two shakes of a cat's tail!
'''Adrien:''' ''(looks at his ring)'' But, does that mean Cat Noir is really who I am? Deep down inside?
'''Plagg:''' ''(flies over to him)'' You're not Cat Noir, but you're not Adrien either. You're both. You're the perfect son who's extremely successful in everything he does. But you're also Cat Noir, who just wants to enjoy life and have fun. One can't exist without the other. And I sure am glad to have both of you back!
''(Plagg and Adrien hug.)''

'''Cat Noir:''' ''(lands next to her)'' I've been a really temperamental kitty, m'lady. I didn't realize how much trouble I'd make for you by giving back my Miraculous.
'''Ladybug:''' ''(sits closer to him)'' Just because I don't need you all the time doesn't mean that I don't need you at all, Cat Noir. No one could ever replace you.
''(Cat Noir smiles, and he and Ladybug turn to watch the sunset as the screen pans upward before showing the end card.)''
