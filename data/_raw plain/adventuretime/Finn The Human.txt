{{L|[''[[Finn]] and [[Jake]] are pulled into the portal created by the Enchiridion. They hit a floating chunk of land and sit there for a second. Finn looks up to see the Lich bound from rock to rock towards the time room in the apparent center of this dimension.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''gasps''] He's heading for that cube. Come on, Jake.}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, yeah.}}
{{L|[''The Lich enters the time room from a hole on the side. Finn and Jake bound to the time room and enter to find the Lich laughing next to [[Prismo]]. He then disappears.'']}}
{{L|Finn| '''Whaaaat?!?!''' He's gone!}}
{{L|Jake| ''What''?! What happened?!}}
{{L|Prismo| Hey, hey! Did you guys see that? You know that was a ghost wearing a dead guy? That might be the nastiest thing I've ever seen. Na-na-na-na-nasty! Nasty jazz! Nast-- [''Almost like beat boxing'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hey, hey! Easy, buddy! That's our friend Billy! He got possessed by the Lich! [''Finn looks very sad and Jake puts an arm around him'']}}
{{L|Prismo| Oh! Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean nothin' by it! I mean, I have a lot of nasty friends. My uncle is nasty. I'm basically honorary nasty.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Jake stretches them down to the floor''] Do you know where he went? We have to find our friend.}}
{{L|Prismo| Who knows?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Depressed''] Uh. Oh.}}
{{L|Prismo| Actually, it depends on the wish I granted him.}}
{{L|Finn| ''"Wish"?'' [''Hastily'']}}
{{L|Prismo| Yeah, he wished for the extinction of all life and I did it. I guess it changed his timeline or something?}}
{{L|Finn| '''WHAT?!?! OH GLOB!'''}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa, wait a minute. How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn?}}
{{L|Prismo| Oh, that's because you're safe in my time room until you make ''your'' wish.}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''They pause to think''] Ohhhh.}}
{{L|Jake| I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc—}}
{{L|Finn| [''Finn pushes Jakes arm down''] Whoa! Wait, Jake. Don't mess this up. Think about it: if we wish everything back to normal, the Lich could just jazz it up again.}}
{{L|Jake| Oh yeah. Jazz.}}
{{L|Finn| Hmmmm. [''Thinking'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hmmmm.}}
{{L|Finn| I got it! I wish... the Lich... never... even ever existed!}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to "[[Farmworld]]" — an alternate world where the Lich never existed. Farmworld Finn enters his farm house with [[Farmworld Jake]]'']}}
{{L|[[Farmworld Finn]]| Mom? Mom, what's wrong?}}
{{L|[[Finn's Mom|Finn's mom]]| [''Holding [[Finn's Baby Brother]] and looking concerned''] Finn, I need you to do something for me. It's very important. [''Jake barks''] I need you to take the mule into town and sell him for as much as you can.}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| What! Sell [[Bartram]]? [''Bartram sits up in the bed in the corner''] But, I love Bartram. What the heck, Mom!}}
{{L|Finn's Mother| Shhh! Finn please, just do as I say. [''She looks out the window concerned'']}}
{{L|[[Trami]]| [''Muffled by the distance''] Got it?}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| [''Looking out the window, Finn sees a group of “stylish” thugs harassing [[Finn's Dad|his dad]]''] Dad?}}
{{L|Trami| I push you, you fall down. [''Trami and another gang member table top him'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| The [[Destiny Gang]]?}}
{{L|Finn's Mother| Everything will be fine, Finn, I promise. Now just do as I say. [''Walks away'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| [''Finn is now outside near the fields sitting on a tree root''] [''sigh''] I'm sorry, Bartram. I guess Dad must be in real trouble to be doin' this. But, I bet there's a lot o' fine folk lookin' to buy a good mule. Why, I bet I could even come visit sometimes. Won't that be swell, Bartram? [''Looks around and sees that the mule is gone''] Bartram? Dang it Bartram! Bar Bar! [''Finn walks through some bushes to find Batram in a dead tree''] What the- Bar Bar, how'd ya get up there? [''sigh''] Whoa! [''Finn falls through some bushes and into an underground cave. Jake follows. There is a frozen missile with a dead man under it''] Jake, look! [[Ice King's crown|Golden crown]]! Unbelievable! We can sell it ''and'' keep Bartram! Bong, bong. [''Finn reaches for the crown'']}}
{{L|[[Farmworld Marceline]]| [''She comes out from behind the missile and cocks her gun''] Hold it right there!}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Who ''are'' you?!}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| I'm a thousand years old and this is ''my'' crown!}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Okay, okay! But, um, maybe I could just borrow it for a little while. [''Finn reaches for the crown again'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| Noooo! No! Noo! This crown is magic. Bad, terrible magic. Too dangerous for mortal fingies like yours! [''Marceline has a flashback of Simon walking onto a hill to watch a squad of bombers.''] One thousand years ago, my beloved friend [[Simon Petrikov]] gave his life to save this foolish, unworthy planet from annihilation. [''A scene shows a mushroom cloud amidst a decimated city and a gang of demons surrounding the Lich walking away from it''] A frightful [[Mushroom bomb|bomb]] was poised to bathe the land in mutagenic horror, [''Farmworld Simon is show directly below the bomb using his not yet complete powers to freeze the bomb in midair''] but using his mastery of ice and snow, Simon froze the bomb in mid-flight only inches from the ground, where it remains to this very day. [''We see Marceline in the cave again''] Today, ever ripe and ready to blow. [''We see Farmworld Simon being crushed by the bomb''] But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished!}}
{{L|[[Farmworld Ice King|Farmworld Simon]]| [''In the flash back''] Little help?}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| [''Farmworld Simon is seen dead and the crown is firing laser-like beams of energy''] And the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy the entire earth was buried in ice for four hundred ''boring'' years. [''First we see a city being frozen almost instantaneously and then we see the earth covered in ice. The flashback ends.'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Uhh, none o' that is true, 'cause magic is fake. Daddy says the false prophets of old used cheap parlor tricks to control the people. [''Farmworld Jake is growling''] And to get babes. Like 10 or 12 hot babes each.}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| No! Magic is real!}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Lady! You been down here too long! Why don't you, just let me- [''Finn goes for the crown again'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| Step off! Or I will use this!}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Lady! Quit it with that thing! [''Finn reels back and Jake begins barking again'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| I'm sorry. You must DIEEEE! [''A laser beam is fired from the gun'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| WAAAAAAAAAAaaaaah… ooo… uuum… [''The laser is ineffective and passes right through him'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| Oh, man! This thing! Dang it! [''She hits it'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Go, Jake! [''Jake jumps at her as a distraction while Finn grabs the crown'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| Aaah! Go back to the underworld, ya beast. [''She throws the gun weakly towards Jake'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Sorry, gotta save my dad! [''They exit the cave'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| Destroy the world more like it! [''huff''] Dummy. I give up.}}
{{L|Farmworld Simon| The crown. Go get it.}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| I know you're not really talking to me. I'm not crazy!}}
{{L|Farmworld Simon| Get the crown! Go get it!}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| [''huff'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Simon| Get the crown, Marceline! Go get it!}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| I can't. My knees!}}
{{L|Farmworld Simon| Oh, that's really disappointing I must say. I'm just—uh, whatever, you're really letting me down right now.}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| Okay, alright. [''farts'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| [''Finn is auctioning off the crown at the [[Junktown]] market''] Cool crown! Who wants a cool crown? I found it on a dead magician dude!}}
{{L|Guy #1| I'll take it!}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Awesome! How much cash ya got?}}
{{L|Guy #1| Ohhh, I'm poor. Uh, but what about I trade you for a personal concert at your house? I'll come over later and sing ya like, four songs. I mostly do covers, but I have originals too. Do you own any spoons?}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| No.}}
{{L|[[Tromo]]| Let me see that! [''He takes the crown'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Hey!}}
{{L|Tromo| Heh!}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| [''gasp''] [''Finn has a flashback of the D gang harassing his dad''] Wait, Destiny Gang. I gotta sell that to pay you guys!}}
{{L|Tromo| Trami, what you think? Is it my style?}}
{{L|Trami| [[Big Destiny]] will know. Yo, boss! [''Trami throws the crown to Big D who is looking off the cliff'']}}
{{L|Big Destiny| Snap! Huh? What is this? [''He turns around''] Are you tellin' me what to wear, Trami?}}
{{L|Trami| No, boss, you look good! [''He is sweating'']}}
{{L|Big Destiny| You think I should reinvent my style and put a stupid thing on my head?!}}
{{L|Trami| No, man! You tell ''us'' what to wear!}}
{{L|Big Destiny| Otherwise you would dress like an idiot! Bam! Crown shorts! [''Big D puts the tip of the crown in his extremely short shorts'']}}
{{L|Trami & Tromo| Amazing! [''Everyone begins clapping.'']}}
{{L|Big Destiny| Yeah-ha-ha!}}
{{L|Tromo| Clap harder, trash bag! [''He pushes down an old man who begins silently crying and clapping faster'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Okay, you guys. Gimme my money and leave my parents alone.}}
{{L|Tromo| Property of old dead person go to Big Destiny. [''Tromo grabs an apple from a stand and takes a bite''] One-arm needs to learn the rules, unless you want your butt handed to you.}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| I guess it wasn't really mine.}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| [''Tromo drops his apple''] It's mine! I'm a demon... half-demon.}}
{{L|Big Destiny| Tromo! Jack up crazy lady! Trami! Take mule back to crib for din-din.}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Whaat! [''Trami hits Finn in the face with his hammer knocking him off Bartram. He lifts up Batram and takes him''] Bar Bar!}}
{{L|Trami| Tough luck, One-arm! [''He and Big D jump onto a ski-lift-like pully system up to their mansion'']}}
{{L|Big Destiny| See you soon, bad-style Junktown! [''Big D laughs evilly'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Bar Bar. [''Finn is about to cry'']}}
{{L|Tromo| End of the road, bat lady! [''He kicks over Farmworld Marceline'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| Oh, my bones!}}
{{L|Tromo| Haha! Ah! [''Finn sticks his flute up Tromo's nose and plays, inflating Tromo's eye''] My eye! I will junk your face! What the! [''Choose Bruce hits him in the head with a head of lettuce'']}}
{{L|Choose Bruce| Destiny gang, get outta town! We're sick of bein' bullied around! [''Everyone cheers'']}}
{{L|Tromo| You make biiig mistake! Especially you, One-arm! [''He backs up to the lift and leaves'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| My name is Finn Mertens! And tell big D I'm comin' for my stuff!}}
{{L|Tromo| Ohhh, you come n' try!}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Are you okay, lady?}}
{{L|Farmworld Marceline| You must promise to—promise to return the crown to its hide-hole.}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| I promise.}}
{{L|Choose Bruce| You'll need this Finn if you want to win. [''He shows Finn a sword attachment for his robotic arm'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Choose Bruce, what is it?}}
{{L|Choose Bruce| It's a weapon for your arm. With this you will defend from harm. [''He replaces his grabber arm with the sword arm'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Feels natural. Like peeing outside. Sort of.}}
{{L|Choose Bruce| Best not to take the lift my friend, else the D gang'll see ya comin' in!}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| No. I ''want'' them to see me. I'm-a go up there AND SHOW THEM MY FACE! [''Finn rides up the lift and kicks down the door and runs in''] Yaaaaaaaaaa-huh? Hello? [''He doesn't see anyone, but hears Bartram bray''] Bar Bar? I'm comin'! Bar bar! [''He runs into the room, but Big D trips him on the way in''] I want my stuff, ya big dump! [''He charges Big D, but he is easily beaten'']}}
{{L|Big Destiny| You want Big D's crown, huh?}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Yeah, and Bar Bar.}}
{{L|Big Destiny| Here ya go then. [''Hands him the crown'']}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| Wha?}}
{{L|Big Destiny| That is your final possession, the last thing you will ever own.}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| What do you…mean? [''He walks over to the window with Big D'']}}
{{L|Big Destiny| Look down there, stupid.}}
{{L|Farmworld Finn| [''gasp''] [''The town is on fire'']}}
{{L|Big Destiny| Town is on fire! See? I made it on fire! Fix up Junktown! Look at old man cry! [''laughs''] That's what happens when you mess with Big D! You get crushed! Your family get crushed! Booya! [''We see the Destiny gang throwing torches everywhere and Choose Bruce crying'']}}
