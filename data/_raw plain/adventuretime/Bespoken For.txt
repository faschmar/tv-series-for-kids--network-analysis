Dang.

and slime.

Weird.

How did this happen, Ice King?

Look, I know it's a lotto take in.

Let's go to the living room.

[ Whoosh ]

Now settle in,get comfortable,

'cause I am gonna tell youeverything.

And it is going toblow your ‐‐ Oop!

I gotta kiss my skyhooksgood night.

Good night, my skookie‐wooks.

[ Kisses ]

Okay.

Dude...

Why does it look likea four‐way pizza?!

Is everyone in Ooolike a zombie?

Is everyone basically dead?

Everyone is not dead.It's much worse.

Let mestart at the beginning.

No.

What am I gonna do withoutmy besties around?

Mm.

♪♪

Mm, okay.Bird watching sounds cool.

Hey, roomie! I'm going out topick up some magic ingredients.

Ooh! Are you makingsomethin' delicious?

Oh, I'm buildinga magic battery to power

my elemental purification spell.

Cool. Bring me a snackie.

Like...a doughnut?

Surprise me.

Oh, I'll surprise you.

[ Under breath ]I'll surprise everyone.

Wait. What was Patiencetalking about?

Oh, it's not important.Something ominous.

Anyways, it was then thatI really got into bird watching.

♪♪

What else we got here?

A penguin.

Oh. Right.

[ Gasps ] Something!

Is that...

Oh...my...glaah!

[ Gasps ]

You a toucan?

Simon, I've been trying so hardto help you.

I've tried reprogramming‐‐nnnyour ‐‐ your crown,

Code‐mapping, penguin‐napping,co‐mingling with magic,

and grasping and grappling,

but it just hasn'tbeen happening.

It's saddening, it's maddening,and I'm rapping and ‐‐ and...

[ Inhales deeply ]

[ Inhales ]

So I'm tryingthe direct approach.

Ugh.Wenk!

No, I don't remember who she is,but I know how to find out.

Hey!

So good to see you!

You still workingat that same place?

Mm, my work takes me all over.

I meant all over the place.

Oh! Before I forget,I just got a new phone.

Would you mind reenteringyour info for me?

It's okay.I know you don't remember me.

No, no, no. I can get this.

[ Inhales slowly, pfft! ]

I lost it.

A long time ago,you and I were...colleagues.

My name is Betty Grof, and ‐‐

That's what I was gonna say!Betty!

[ Inhales ]

Hey, do you wanna goon a date with me tonight?

[ Babbles ]Uh, buh, buh, buh. Yes.

Meet me at 8:00at my Magic Man House.

[ Laughing ]

♪♪

[ Ring ]

Hello?

You are not gonna believewhat just happened.

What?

A lady touched me!

That's cool. Who is she?

I think she might bean exotic bird.

But guess who's goingon a date tonight!

Wow. So what are yougonna wear?

Oh, probably my go‐to ‐‐blue muumuu.

Ugh!

No! You need to geta nice bespoked suit.

A be‐wudda‐wa?

"Bespoke" means it's custom‐madeto fit your specific dimensions

and emphasize what's flatteringabout your shape.

Like my abs.

No, I'd say you're kindabottom‐heavy.

No, that's just the muumuu,dawg.

I'm jacked.

Hmm.

Oh, yeah.

What the heck d‐‐Shh!

'Kay, so then we wentsuit shopping.

It's very important to picka good, natural fabric.

As for color, for a first suit,

you should choose between black,navy, or charcoal grey.

Why?

It's a wizard fashion rule.

If you stray, you'll looklike a fool.

How's about if I make my suita onesie?

[ Smack ]Ow!

Whoa.

Let's get to work!

♪♪

And then Life‐Giving Maguschecked an even darker...

[ Whispers ] What is going on?...shade of gray against my face.

Until finally...

Life‐Giving Magus: Yep!

Pretty fly for an ice guy.

♪♪

Male voice: [ Singsongy ]Ding dong! Someone's here!

That's clever.

Hello, Simon.

Uh, flowers.

Come in. Come in.

I really like howyou decorated the place.

I'm really into skullsand old teeth in jars, too.

Ready for our date?

You bet.

Bah‐bam!

Aaaaah!

[ Pants ] This a‐way.

What is this place?

In the old days,we would meet here,

and you would give me booksbecause you had a subscription

to the Book a Day Club.

Book a Day?

You gave me the excess booksbecause I was associated

with Books for the Bookless.

[ Laughs ] Simon!You want your usual booth?

Bogo! You remember him?Lead the way, Bogo!

So...

Yes?

Are we going splitsies?

[ Sighs ]

Okay, I'll pay for halfyour entrée.

But if you get an appyor a dessert, it's on you.

Mmm, mmm, mmm!

[ Smacks lips ]

[ Inhaling deeply ] Aah!

What? There somethingin my beard?

You don't remember any of this?

[ Thinking ] She's startingto freak me out.

Ring, ring!

Sorry. I should take this.

Oh, hi, Gunter.No. I'm on my date.

[ Inhaling deeply ]

Gunter, I have to go.

[ Chomping ]

Technology, right? [ Chuckles ]

Aah! No!

[ Zapping ]It's all wrong!

Ugh! Zap!Wha?

[ Whoosh ]

Well, that was terrifying.

I've tried everything I canthink of to make Simon remember.

Is there something I'm missing?

What am I doing wrong?

Maybe you're going after someonewho doesn't exist anymore.

Why not take him as he is?

You're making a lot of sense,Tiny Manticore.

We're like two shadows,two ghosts caught in limbo.

It sounds depressingwhen you say it that way.

Think of a different wayto say it.

[ Crying softly ]

[ Sighs heavily ]

Wenk.

Oh, uh, just stretching.

Wenk?

The date?Uh, yeah, it went great.

I don't know abouta second date, though.

I don't wanna be that guy

who just hangs out withhis girlfriend all the time

and doesn't see his friends.

Man, I wanna be that guyso bad.

[ Whoosh ]

Hey, I was just talking aboutyou to my penguin.

Have you met Gunter?

Yes. I kidnapped himthat one time.

Look, Simon ‐‐I mean, Ice King.

Yeah, who's this Simon guyyou keep yakking about?

Should I be jealous?

He's somebody I knewa long time ago.

Hey, you still intobird watching?

Watch this.

[ Electricity crackles ]Mmm...zow!

[ Birds chirping ][ Laughs ] Amazing!

[ Laughs ]Such beautiful birds!

They're all for you, Ice King.

Woof. What a bust.

These aresome low‐grade fairies.

My magic battery isgoing to su‐‐

Who's this dancing withthe I. K.?

[ Electricity crackles ]

Bird friend! [ Laughs ]

How delightful.

[ Laughing ]

Ha! [ Sighs ]

Huh? Where didthe weird lady go?

Uh...well,when you weren't looking,

her ‐‐ her mom showed upand told her that

her old boyfriend wanted to bewith her again,

and they ran off together.The end.

Her mom?

Well, I gotta go.

I almost forgot!

Surprise!

[ Crying, chewing ]

[ Groans ]

I wonder if my roomiehas any more

of these soothing doughnuts.

Only one way to find out!

[ Humming ]

[ Zaps ]

Then everything went nuts.

There was all this lightand noise.

I grabbed as many penguinsas I could ‐‐ one.
