{{L|[''The gang follows Princess Bubblegum's lead. A nearby bush rustles and [[Crunchy]] emerges, out of breath. He gasps as [[King of Ooo]], riding a horse and wielding a bow and arrow, jumps out of the bush after him and knocks him on his backside.'']}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Ha-ha!}}
{{L|Crunchy|Stop, please!}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Don't be such a nerd, Crunchy. [''draws back cotton-tipped arrow''] Hunting is the most royal of sports. The people expect it of their princess-king.}}
