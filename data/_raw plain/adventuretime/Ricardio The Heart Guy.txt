{{L|[''The episode begins with [[Ice King]] flying with [[Princess Bubblegum]], cackling deviously.'']}}
{{L|[[Finn]]| Hey, ''fart''-face!!}}
{{L|Ice King| Huh?}}
{{L|Finn| Unhand Princess Bubblegum!!}}
{{L|Ice King| Foolish interlopers! Zah! [''Fires ice magic at Finn'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Evading it''] Whoa! [''Throws a snowball at him''] Ah!}}
{{L|Ice King| Ee hee hee hee—OOH! [''Gets hit by snowball''] MY EYESIGHT!}}
{{L|[''[[Jake]] forms his posterior into Princess Bubblegum's shape while Finn puts two rocks on it, representing her eyes. He replaces Princess Bubblegum with his posterior without Ice King noticing.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Huh? Hee hee hee!}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, Ice King! I bet you'll never kiss the princess!}}
{{L|Ice King| I will kiss her! I will! [''To "princess"''] Hold still. [''Kisses Jake's posterior''] Mwah!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Laughs''] You just kissed Jake's butt!}}
{{L|Ice King| What?! [''Jake reforms his posterior.''] EEEEGH!! [''The other three laugh.''] [''Flying away''] The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, Princess—MINE!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys.}}
{{L|Finn| You're welcome, Princess. [''She hugs him.''] Uh... [''He blushes, and Jake raises his eyebrow, amused.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| I'm gonna throw you two a party. Meet at the Candy Kingdom—TONIGHT!}}
{{L|[''The three cheer. "PARTY TIME" logo pops up and balloons fill up the screen to shift to the next scene. Finn and Jake are walking to the [[Princess Bubblegum's castle|Candy Castle]] through the [[Cotton Candy Forest]].'']}}
{{L|Jake| That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum?}}
{{L|Finn| I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift... in return for throwing us this party.}}
{{L|Jake| Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt.}}
{{L|Finn| What?}}
{{L|Jake| I bet you wish ''you'' were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish ''you'' were the Ice King and the ''princess'' was my butt!}}
{{L|Finn| What?!}}
{{L|Jake| Hmm... [''Snapping''] OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha!}}
{{L|Finn| That's ridiculous! [''Finn imagines Princess Bubblegum kissing him, and he sighs contentedly.''] Huh? Uggghhh!! [''Jake runs ahead laughing.''] What's so funny?}}
{{L|[''Hard cut to the Candy Castle'']}}
{{L|[[Peppermint Butler|Peppermint Butler]]| Hey, everybody. Finn and Jake are here.}}
{{L|Jake| Who's ready to party?!}}
{{L|[''The crowd seems focused on and gathered around something else. Finn and Jake confusedly look at each other.'']}}
{{L|Finn| What's everyone laughing at?}}
{{L|[[Wildberry Princess]]| Shh!}}
{{L|[[Ricardio]]| Stand back, everyone. This style of massage is called, "[[Best Friend Massage]]."}}
{{L|[[Lumpy Space Princess]]| Oh, my gosh...}}
{{L|Ricardio| Because it can only be done for friends. It is completely consensual.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, holy cow...}}
{{L|Ricardio| Relax yourself now, Lumpy Space Princess... YAH! [''Backflips and pounds her'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Oh! I feel so great!}}
{{L|Finn| Who ''is'' that guy?}}
{{L|Ricardio| Hahaaa!}}
{{L|[''Jake shrugs. A fanfare is heard and Princess Bubblegum enters.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Greetings, party-goers! Glad you could all make it!}}
{{L|Finn| Princess Bubblegum! [''Ricardio stares at her and he himself starts "beating" hard.''] Princess. I just wanted to thank you for—}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''Cutting in''] Oh, my gosh! PB, ya gotta check out this super cute guy. You're gonna love 'im. [''They leave Finn and Jake.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Uhhh...}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| This is... Oh. Oh, my gosh. I don't even know your name.}}
{{L|Ricardio| Ricardio. Ricardio at your service. I've been waiting all evening to meet you, Princess. [''Kissing her hand''] Mwah! [''Finn pockets his gift, irritated.''] I've heard you appreciate ancient technology. Have you ever used the balbaflonic laser to align the hybernotalist rift in the bubaflon plasmodial formation?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Whoa! No, I haven't! [''Music starts up; crowd moves to the dance floor.''] Wanna continue this conversation on the dance floor?}}
{{L|Ricardio| [''Exiting with her''] It would be my pleasure, Princess.}}
{{L|Finn| Why didn't the princess invite ''me'' to dance?}}
{{L|Jake| If you wanna dance, just go ''dance''!}}
{{L|Finn| But now she's dancing with ''him''! Ah... I feel... '''weird'''!}}
{{L|Jake| Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy.}}
{{L|Finn| BLAAAARGH!!}}
{{L|Jake| Look, man, just go out there and get down! [''Pushes him onto the dance floor'']}}
{{L|Ricardio| [''To Princess Bubblegum''] —transmordial layers completely independent of the babylons. Eh?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Wow! That would mean that the babylons would fluctuate with the piranha-nanosphere!}}
{{L|Ricardio| Correct!}}
{{L|Finn| Agh! [''Goes back to Jake''] They're talkin' about science, man! I can't compete with that!}}
{{L|Jake| Do the [[Science Dance]]! Remember it? It was sorta like this. [''Does it''] Wah unh we ah eeh...}}
{{L|Finn| You think that'll work?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah! Probably. [''Pushes him back onto the dance floor''] Do it, man! You're a pro!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Dancing''] Science Dance! Science Dance!}}
{{L|Ricardio| [''Still talking with Bubblegum''] —lower proximities to—}}
{{L|Finn| Science Dance! Hey, eh, Princess! You wanna spend some time with ''me''?}}
{{L|Ricardio| Excuse me, Princess. You must excuse me. [''Exits'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Oh, uh... Alright! [''To Finn''] Finn, what the ''cabbage''? I was learning about [[Zanoits]]!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Prevaricating''] Oh... I'm... into Zanoits! Th-They're the best!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of [[Plantoids]] a year.}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, no, not the Plantoids!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Plantoids produce mellotoxin! [''Finn stares.''] Mellotoxin ''kills'' Zanoits!!}}
{{L|Finn| ...So are Zanoits... ''good'' things?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| [''Changing the subject''] You're totally jealous of Ricardio.}}
{{L|Finn| No, I'm not. I just don't like the way he talks to you. It makes me feel weird.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| That's jealousy, hun.}}
{{L|Finn| I'm not ''jealous''! I'M '''''WEIRD'''''!!!}}
{{L|[''The party notices Finn's scene.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''To himself''] Woof! Man... This is goin' ''bad''. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait. [''He and Finn are alone.''] Wow, man, what ''happened'' out there?}}
{{L|Finn| Agh... I don't know! I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and—}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too.}}
{{L|Finn| I ''know''! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain.}}
{{L|Jake| Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?}}
{{L|Finn| No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister!}}
{{L|Jake| Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry.}}
{{L|Finn| I'll ''prove'' he's a villain!}}
{{L|Jake| How?}}
{{L|Finn| Stakeout.}}
{{L|[''Scene shifts to outside in the Candy Kingdom. Finn and Jake are on a roof, and Finn is looking through binoculars.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Here he comes! [''Viewing Ricardio and Princess Bubblegum''] They're talking!}}
{{L|Jake| Lemme see. [''Gets binoculars''] I can read their lips. [''Mimicking Princess Bubblegum''] "Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!" [''Mimicking Ricardio''] "You look kind of like a big pink baguette!"}}
{{L|Finn| [''Taking back binoculars''] Get serious, Jake!! This is life and death!}}
{{L|Jake| ''Is'' it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just ''looks'' wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice.}}
{{L|Finn| I gotta trust my gut!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Grabbing gut''] Hmm.}}
{{L|Finn| He's on the move! Let's roll! [''The two swing onto a [[Gumball Guardian|Guardian of the Royal Promise]].''] I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottles—and pretending to stab someone!}}
{{L|Jake| So... he's recycling... or what?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Takes off binoculars''] I think your gut's a little naive, Jake. [''Puts on binoculars''] Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something! [''Ice King and Ricardio quarrel.''] Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!}}
{{L|Jake| So I was right! He ''is'' a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious! [''To gut''] You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!}}
{{L|Finn| No way. This proves he's a ''super''-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!}}
{{L|[''Jake sings the [[Gut Song]].'']}}
{{L|Finn| Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!}}
{{L|Jake| Or good!}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to downtown in the Candy Kingdom. Ricardio walks deviously and accidentally runs into Finn.'']}}
{{L|Ricardio| Oof!}}
{{L|Finn| So what're you doin', Ricardio? Are you evil?}}
{{L|Jake| Or nice with an evil face?}}
{{L|Ricardio| That's none of your business.}}
{{L|Finn| The safety of Princess Bubblegum ''is'' my business!}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not.}}
{{L|Ricardio| Oh, yeah?}}
{{L|Finn & Jake [''In unison'']| Yeah.}}
{{L|Ricardio| Oh, ''yeah''?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah. [''Slightly annoyed''] Yes!}}
{{L|Finn| You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff!}}
{{L|Ricardio| Now that my plan is nearly complete, there is no way you could stop me.}}
{{L|Finn| I could stop you if I wanted!}}
{{L|Ricardio| Oh, yeah?}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah!}}
{{L|Ricardio| Oh, ''yeah''??}}
{{L|Finn| YEEEAAAH!!!}}
{{L|[''Finn punches Ricardio, knocking him down. Princess Bubblegum enters.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| [''Gasps''] What's going on here?}}
{{L|Finn| Princess?!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Ricardio?!}}
{{L|Ricardio| [''Weakly''] Yes... I'm alright, Princess.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Finn... why'd you do it?}}
{{L|Finn| He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| These were for our balbaflonic laser.}}
{{L|Ricardio| It's not all his fault, Princess. I might've looked a little threatening.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business.}}
{{L|Finn| But...}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy. [''They exit.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Sigh''] She ''hates'' me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio.}}
{{L|Ice King| No, Finn! [''Emerges from dark alleyway''] You were not wrong. He is evil! [''Collapses'']}}
{{L|Finn| Ice King! What do you know about this? Tell me or I'll do something!}}
{{L|Jake| Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged!}}
{{L|Finn| I don't care! I only care about Ricardio!}}
{{L|Ice King| But my enervated condition has ''everything'' to do with ''him''. [''Flashback begins; Ice King does voice-over''] I was trying to cast a spell that would give me total control of Princess Bubblegum's heart! ...But I messed it all up... and lost control of ''mine''. [''Ricardio come's out of Ice King's chest in flashback. He runs towards the window laughing.''] He planned to rip out Princess Bubblegum's heart... to make it his bride. [''Ricardio sticks his tongue out and exits laughing.''] Without my heart, I grew weak. [''Ice King groans in flashback.''] But I made my way to the Candy Kingdom to look for him. In an alleyway, I begged him to [''In flashback, Ice King mouths these words as current Ice King says them''] return to me and leave the princess alone. [''Flashback ends.''] But he threw me in the dumpster and left me for dead. [''Reaching his hand out at Finn''] Stop Ricardio!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Slapping hand away''] Agh! Come on, Jake! [''They run to the Candy Castle.''] Gotta save the princess!}}
{{L|[''They enter.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Princess Bubblegum!!}}
{{L|Finn| Princess!! [''Gasps'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Finn!! Jake!!}}
{{L|[''She is tied up in the rope from earlier and Ricardio is next to her with the broken bottle in his hand.'']}}
{{L|Ricardio| You were right all along, Finn! Now I'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it!}}
{{L|Finn| Not if I can help it!}}
{{L|[''They chase Ricardio, and Ricardio ends up next to Bubblegum again.'']}}
{{L|Ricardio| One step closer and I'll remove her heart!!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Finn! I feel like a big idiot for doubting you! He was just so engaging! ...But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak.}}
{{L|Ricardio| Shut your mouth up, Princess! [''Jake knocks Ricardio down by stretching his jowl at him.''] I'm gonna smooch that heart!! It will be my bride!!}}
{{L|Finn| Why don't you marry someone your ''own'' size?! Like my foot?!}}
{{L|Ricardio| Huh?!}}
{{L|[''Finn kicks him.'']}}
{{L|Finn| And my fist?!}}
{{L|[''Finn punches him twice.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Crawling in''] Stop! Stop it! That's my ''heart'', you piece of—}}
{{L|Finn| Ice King. [''Ice King crawls towards Ricardio.''] Should we... let 'im take his heart back? He ''is''... ''villainous''...}}
{{L|Jake| I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man.}}
{{L|Ice King| Oh, yeah...}}
{{L|Ricardio| Wait! Wait! No!}}
{{L|Ice King| Come to daddy...}}
{{L|Ricardio| Noooooooooo!}}
{{L|Ice King| Yeah, there you go... [''Puts him in his chest''] Like that? Huh?}}
{{L|Ricardio| [''Sinking into chest''] Seeee you guys laterrrr...}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Reinvigorated''] I feel wonderful! Hahaha! And now that I've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day!}}
{{L|Finn| No, she won't!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| ''Yeah'', no, I won't!}}
{{L|Ice King| Yes you WILL! [''He charges up his ice magic, but Finn kicks him. He begins flying away.''] Well... maybe not today... or tomorrow... but another day! Another—[''Accidentally knocks head on door frame. He grunts in pain as he exits.'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to a dining room in the castle. Finn, Jake, and Bubblegum are eating spaghetti.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Thanks again for saving me... ''again''.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Mouth full''] Don't mention it.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore. [''Winks'']}}
{{L|Finn| I ''never'' get jealous.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| [''Romantically''] Kiss me, Finn. [''Finn blushes, astonished.''] Ahem. [''She is doing a hand-stand and wearing a Jake mask on her posterior. She uses a deeper voice.''] I mean... kiss me, Finn. [''Normal voice, whispering''] Am I doing it right, Jake?}}
{{L|[''Jake chuckles.'']}}
{{L|Finn| NOOOOOOOO!!!}}
{{L|[''Iris out'']}}
