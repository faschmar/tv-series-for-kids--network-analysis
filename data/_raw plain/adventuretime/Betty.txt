{{L|[''The episode opens to Bella Noche opening his eyes in a secret chamber.'']}}
{{L|[[Bella Noche]]|Have you obtained the staff of [[Stranson Doughblow]]?}}
{{L|[[Forest Wizard]]|Yes, Bella Noche. We procured the staff using the full extent of our wizardy ways.}}
{{L|Bella Noche|Then the time has come to reveal my true form, and when I materialize on this... [''continues talking'']}}
{{L|[''Ice King spies on them and Bella Noche from behind the stairway.'']}}
{{L|[[Ice King]]|[''talking to himself quietly''] Oh, this striz is going down, man.}}
{{L|Bella Noche|...you will receive your end of the deal.}}
{{L|[[Laser Wizard]]|The lost system of Antediluvian magick—the tightest of all wiz biz.}}
{{L|Forest Wizard|So right and tight, I get restless leg syndrome about it. Look. [''shaking his restless leg'']}}
{{L|Bella Noche|And now, it will be yours.}}
{{L|Ice King|And mine!}}
{{L|[''[[Bufo]], Laser Wizard and Forest Wizard surprisly looks at Ice King.'']}}
{{L|Forest Wizard|What the blood?! Ice King!}}
{{L|Ice King|Listen, dudes, all I want is to be in [[Secret Society|the club]] and plus up my magic. What's the problem?}}
{{L|Laser Wizard|Your life is my problem.}}
{{L|Bella Noche|Too late, fools! Bella Noche emerges!}}
{{L|[''Bella Noche grabs the staff and places it on the circle with his magic.'']}}
{{L|Forest Wizard|Whoa! What the—?}}
{{L|[''The Grand Master Wizard explodes the doorway with his magic, with the [[Wizard Police]] behind him.'']}}
{{L|[[Grand Master Wizard]]|Stop that now, trash cones! Bella Noche must ''not'' cross into our world!}}
{{L|Ice King|Eh, why not, again?}}
{{L|[''Bella Noche combines the sword, the staff, the golden cup, and the crystal ball. It all powers up Bella Noche.'']}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|'''Duck!'''}}
{{L|[''The Grand Master Wizard and the wizard policemen take cover. An explosion of anti-magic bursts. The wizards scream and Ice King screams too. [[Ice King's crown]] gems turn white, shut down by Bella Noche's anti-magic. With the crown off his head, Ice King turns young - turns back to his previous life before the Mushroom War: Simon Petrikov. The wizards were laying down, depowered. Bella Noche changed into a powerful form inside the black crystal of dark anti-magic.'']}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|Aw, cram! Here we go!}}
{{L|Forest Wizard|[''gets up''] Uhhhh... hey. Hey, I—I can't feel my magic!}}
{{L|Laser Wizard|Me neither. What gives?}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|Bella Noche is a being of pure anti-magic! Y'alls got played!}}
{{L|Simon|Uh, hello?}}
{{L|Forest Wizard|Oh, what a fool am I! [''Bella Noche slaps him aside.''] Aaaaaaaaaaah!}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|[''to Wizard Police''] Go! Destroy! Throw your boots at it, or—I don't know!}}
{{L|Simon|Huh? [''starts walking out'']}}
{{L|[''The Wizard Police charge at Bella Noche and throw their boots at it.'']}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|Dang. Sorry, Ice King.}}
{{L|Simon|[''panting''] [''trips''] This must be it, man. [''looks at his reflection in a puddle''] I've crossed into some super-insane zone where I feel like I'm just normal again. [''takes off crown''] Or maybe I'm just normal again.}}
{{L|[[Ash]]|Hey, stop looking at yourself. You're ugly, bro. Get lost. This is ''my'' busking spot.}}
{{L|Simon|[''punches Ash off his [[magic carpet]]''] Sorry, man. No time! Go, carpet! [''flies to the [[Ice Kingdom]] and then into the The Past room''] Whoa! [''gets off''] It's got to be here. Even in my prolonged state of insanity, my immutable essence must have known to—oh, yes. [''puts on glasses''] Hello. [''pushes over a desk, revealing a secret entrance''] Ah, my research. My jackie—jacket! [''reading books' spines''] Mutation, mutation, mind expa—aha! [''takes a book off the shelf''] "[[Mystic Rituals And Their Space Time Applications]]" by Simon Petrikov and [[Betty Grof]]. [''quietly''] Betty. [''opens book's cover, revealing a photograph of [[Marceline|Marcy]] and [[Hambo]], which falls to the floor''] Whoops. Marceline?}}
{{L|[''Scene switches to [[Marceline's house]].'']}}
{{L|Marceline|A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four.}}
{{L|[[Finn]]|Wait!}}
{{L|Marceline|What?}}
{{L|Finn|Why are you holding your bass up high like that?}}
{{L|Marceline|Mm-mm-mmm. (I don't know.) I get better finger action this way.}}
{{L|Finn|But you look like a nerd. Move it back down. It's better.}}
{{L|[[Jake]]|Move the bass down.}}
{{L|Finn|A-move the bass a-down.}}
{{L|Jake|Be reasonable.}}
{{L|[''[[Marceline's phone]] rings.'']}}
{{L|Marceline|[''annoyed''] Yes?}}
{{L|Simon|Marcy, it's me, Simon. I'm back, but my body might donk out soon, so get to the Ice Kingdom fast and help me with this time portal so I can find Betty and say I'm sorry before I croakboat! I know that's a lot to process, but hurry, and bring Hambo. Hambo is the key.}}
{{L|[''Marceline is now on the floor.'']}}
{{L|Simon (over telephone)|Okay, Marcy? You got that? Marcy?}}
{{L|[''Flashback begins, showing Simon and Marcy walking through post-apocalyptic Ooo.'']}}
{{L|Marceline|A long, long time ago, Simon was my only friend. He was there when I needed help.}}
{{L|[''Flashback ends.'']}}
{{L|Marceline|[''holding Hambo''] All he ever wanted was to find Betty, and now I can help him.}}
{{L|[''Scene changes to Finn and Marceline riding Jake towards the Ice King's castle. Marceline gets off and enters.'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Simon?}}
{{L|[[Gunter]]|Wenk! [''leads them to Simon''] Wenk!}}
{{L|Marceline|Simon!}}
{{L|Simon|Marceline!}}
{{L|[''They embrace.'']}}
{{L|Marceline|I thought I'd never see you again.}}
{{L|Simon|I can hardly believe it myself. You're all grown up.}}
{{L|Jake|Believe! She's like a million years old!}}
{{L|Simon|One million years? How could it be?!}}
{{L|Marceline|He's just kidding. I'm only a thousand.}}
{{L|Jake|And still looking good!}}
{{L|Finn|Do you remember anything from when you were the Ice King?}}
{{L|Simon|Nothing specific—just dreamlike impressions.}}
{{L|Finn|Do you still have impressions from all the times we flipped your bricks?}}
{{L|Simon|I have... bruises. [''coughs''] Excuse me. I—[''coughs harder'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Man, Simon.}}
{{L|Simon|I'm fine. [''coughs'']}}
{{L|Marceline|You're dying!}}
{{L|Simon|Well, yes, but only in increments. I've still got work to do. Finn and Jake, will you run my generator?}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, man.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake climb onto the stationary bike and start pedaling.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Cool.}}
{{L|[''The time travel device starts glowing.'']}}
{{L|Simon|That's great! Keep pedaling! All we need now is the catalyst—an object from the past that has been lovingly tended to through the ages.}}
{{L|Marceline|[''sighs''] Goodbye, Hambo. [''kisses it and hugs it one last time'']}}
{{L|Simon|Because of you, I can say goodbye to Betty and tell her I'm sorry for driving her away. Thank you, Marceline. [''drops Hambo into the liquid'']}}
{{L|[''The portal opens, showing Betty running around a corner and hiding.'']}}
{{L|Betty|[''panting'']}}
{{L|Simon (possessed)|[''shooting ice lightning skyward''] Where's my Betty? Where's my princess?! Princess! Princess!!}}
{{L|Betty|Simon, don't leave me like this.}}
{{L|[''Suddenly, the portal opens above her.'']}}
{{L|Simon|Betty? Betty. Betty!}}
{{L|Betty|Simon? What is going on?}}
{{L|Simon|I'm a thousand years in the future, love. I opened this portal so we could say goodbye.}}
{{L|Betty|You're dumping me?}}
{{L|Simon|No! It's just that everything changed after I put on that crown. I—I went crazy. You ran away. I—I never saw you again.}}
{{L|Betty|But where would I go without you?}}
{{L|Simon|I'll never know.}}
{{L|Betty|I don't understand. You don't seem crazy now. I mean, in the future.}}
{{L|[''The portal opening starts shrinking.'']}}
{{L|Simon|The portal is closing. There's no time to explain. Just know that I love you, and I forgive you for leaving me.}}
{{L|Betty|Simon, I know who I'm leaving you for!}}
{{L|Simon|Who?}}
{{L|Betty|[''leaps through portal''] You, dum-dum! [''kisses Simon'']}}
{{L|[''Simon collapses.'']}}
{{L|Betty|Simon? [''picks him up and places him on the magic carpet''] What's wrong? Are you sick?}}
{{L|Simon|No, I'm old. The crown was keeping me alive, but its magic was negated by the creature Bella Noche.}}
{{L|Betty|Don't die, Simon. I just got here.}}
{{L|Simon|Oh, I'm sorry, Betty.}}
{{L|Betty|I know! I'll fix the crown, and then I'll figure out how to fix you!}}
{{L|Simon|What? No. Guys, stop her.}}
{{L|Jake|Uh...}}
{{L|Marceline|Hmm...}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, but...}}
{{L|Jake|It kind of sounds like a good idea.}}
{{L|Betty|Right, whoever you are. [''takes crown from Gunter and walks back to Simon''] I'm sorry. It's the only way. [''pulls carpet out from under him'']}}
{{L|Simon|No!}}
{{L|Betty|[''gets on carpet''] Okay, rug, take me to Bella Noche.}}
{{L|[''Simon grabs on to the back and flies upward out of the castle with Betty.'']}}
{{L|Betty|Get on, Simon!}}
{{L|Simon|I am getting on... the death bus.}}
{{L|Death|[''flying alongside them''] I've got you in my sights, Simon. [''laughs'']}}
{{L|Simon|It's my time, Betty! I don't want to be the Ice King again. It's like living with eternal diaper butt. I can't do it!}}
{{L|Betty|Not forever. Destroying Bella Noche and getting your power back will buy me time to find a loophole that'll undo your curse and your death. I can do it! You got to believe me, Simon.}}
{{L|Simon|I...}}
{{L|Death|Get real, man. You're gonna be the Ice King till the sun blows up. This is your one chance. I made a mix tape for the ride: "Summer Jams 3"!}}
{{L|Simon|If I don't let her try, then what am I? What am us?}}
{{L|Betty|What?}}
{{L|Death|Eh, fair enough. See you in a few. [''disappears'']}}
{{L|[''The scene changes back to Bella Noche, who was grown gigantic.'']}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|This brioche won't stop growing. [''shoots crossbow''] [[Ron James]], what took... [''One of Bella Noche's tentacles slams the ground.''] you?}}
{{L|Ron James|Yo, my lab got creamed! I had to dummy-rig an alchemical filter out of a dirty bidet and a vaporizer!}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|But will the double-negative magic work?}}
{{L|Ron James|Heck yeah! Ron James always delivers! Check it out, brotha! Yaah! [''throws potion at Bella Noche''] In your face!}}
{{L|Bella Noche|[''screams'']}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard & Ron James|Yeah!}}
{{L|[''Bella Noche grows even larger.'']}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|What the stink is that?!}}
{{L|Ron James|My lab conditions were not ideal.}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|But you did not deliver! [''shakes him'']}}
{{L|Ron James|Peace, man! Aaah!}}
{{L|[''Betty and Simon arrive.'']}}
{{L|Betty|We're here to help!}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|Help how?}}
{{L|[''Bella Noche shoots an electric bolt at Ron James and Grand Master Wizard, who both fall flat on their backs.'']}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|We're toast, bro.}}
{{L|Simon|[''grunts''] [''falls off carpet'']}}
{{L|Betty|Simon!}}
{{L|Simon|[''sighs'']}}
{{L|Betty|Hey, don't scare me like that.}}
{{L|Simon|Just hold my hand to your face. This will be my... last sensation.}}
{{L|Betty|Don't be a wimp, Simon! Just give me a second! [''gets on carpet and flies toward Bella Noche'']}}
{{L|Death|You got about 15 seconds.}}
{{L|[''Bella Noche shoots at Betty, propelling her onto the creature's exterior. Betty then climbs inside and reaches the core.'']}}
{{L|Bella Noche|How the—? Wait.}}
{{L|Betty|Surprise! [''punches, then kicks Bella Noche''] Tranch.}}
{{L|[''Bella Noche explodes, sending out a shock wave of magic energy.'']}}
{{L|Death|You lose, Simon. Sorry, man. [''walks away and disappears'']}}
{{L|Ice King|Uh, huh?}}
{{L|[''The wizards cheer and use their powers in celebration.'']}}
{{L|Ice King|This a party? Huh?}}
{{L|Grand Master Wizard|[[Wizard City]] is saved! [''laughs''] [''hugs Ice King'']}}
{{L|Ice King|Whoa! Heh. Okay. Whoopee!}}
{{L|[''Scene changes to the Ice King's castle.'']}}
{{L|Ice King|So then, Ron James told me this girl I was with flew into Bella Noche and mysteriously defeated it for me! Wow! [''laughs'']}}
{{L|[''[[Muscle Princess]] struggles to free herself from a block of ice.'']}}
{{L|Ice King|Just my luck, right? Black out for a day and meet the woman of your dreams.}}
{{L|Muscle Princess|I will get you!}}
{{L|Ice King|Hey, don't be jealous, Muscle Princess. She's gone—kablooey. Let's be realistic, right? We both know you're not my top pick.}}
{{L|[''Muscle Princess breaks free.'']}}
{{L|Ice King|Oh, [[Grob Gob Glob Grod|Grod]]!}}
{{L|Muscle Princess|[''roars'']}}
{{L|Ice King|No!}}
{{L|[''Muscle Princess pommels him repeatedly.'']}}
{{L|Ice King|Aaah! Go home! You can go! Aah!}}
{{L|[''Gunter turns to see Betty outside, watching from her flying carpet. She lingers for a moment then flies away.'']}}
