{{L|[''The episode starts with [[Finn]], [[Jake]], and [[BMO]] playing a game of bocce. BMO throws a ball.'']}}
{{L|BMO| Jake, if I beat you, you have to call me "sensei" for a month.}}
{{L|Jake| Deal.}}
{{L|[''Turtle Princess goes by on a slow-moving rocket.'']}}
{{L|[[Turtle Princess]]| Hi, guys!}}
{{L|Finn, Jake, & BMO| 'Sup, Turtle Princess?}}
{{L|[''She leaves them. Scene cuts to Lumpy Space Princess swatting bugs off of herself.'']}}
{{L|[[Lumpy Space Princess]]| Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Get your hands ''off'' me, Steven!! YAH! [''Throws him down''] And you, too, Chad! [''Flicks ant away'']}}
{{L|[''Turtle Princess enters.'']}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Heeeey, giiiirl!}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Heeeey, giiiirl!}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Brought you some little fruit pies.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Awesome. [''Starts eating'']}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| How ya doin' out here?}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Turtle Princess, the men out here will ''not'' leave me alone!}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Huh... it must be nice.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Nah. It's horrible. They just want me for my lumps! [''Vulture screeches at them.''] These lumps aren't for SALE, BILLY! [''Throws fruit pie at vulture making it fly away.''] [''To Turtle Princess''] Aren't you sick of men going after your ''turtle'' lumps?}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Actually, I've never been able to work my T-lumps. I just know what I read in books. [''Gasps''] Hey! You should write a book telling me how to ''do'' it!}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, my Glob! Turtle Princess! I've always wanted to write trashy books for ladies! [''Snake hisses at her''] YAH! [''Hits it''] BACK UP ''OFF'' ME, [[Ricky|RICKY]]!! [''To Turtle Princess''] Yeah, everyone needs to know when I work these lumps, no man is immune to their influence!}}
{{L|[''Two balls land in front of them. Finn enters.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake's ball landed over here, BMO!}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| [''Gasps''] LSP! Finn would be perfect as the test subject for your lump studies!}}
{{L|[''BMO and Jake enter.'']}}
{{L|BMO| Yay! I win! [''To Jake''] Bow to your sensei!}}
{{L|Jake| Aaah...}}
{{L|Finn| Heh heh heh heh heh heh!}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| [''To Lumpy Space Princess''] You gotta go undercover and conduct your lump science on ''him''. Prove to the world that even a white knight like Finn is no match for the power of your lumps!}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| I'll do it! For the world! And for ''you'', girl!}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Oh, girl!}}
{{L|[''They both smile. Lumpy Space Princess grabs a plastic grocery bag off the ground and dons it like a spaghetti-strap dress. Scene shifts to the Grasslands; Lumpy Space Princess is going to the [[Tree Fort]].'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''Recording herself''] Day one: on my way to Finn and Jake's. Side-note: I look ''fresh to death'' with my new dress and purse. Mm! Mm! Mm! [''Takes out a fruit pie and "puts on" its custard before eating the fruit pie; knocks on Finn and Jake's front door; Jake answers.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hello?}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''Seductively''] Heeey, Jaaaake... Is ''Finn'' hooome...?}}
{{L|Jake| [''Wincing in disgust''] Ooh!}}
{{L|Finn| 'Sup, LSP?}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, hey. I'm answering that ad you put out for the adventure secretary.}}
{{L|Finn| Wha?}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Ugh... Hold on. I'll get it. [''Starts digging through bag''] Hold on. It's down in there. Okay, wait, I got it. Uh, here you go.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Reading fake ad''] "WANTED—ADVENTURE SECRETARY." [''Sniffs it''] Smells like fruit pie.}}
{{L|Jake| It's nice of you to wanna be our secretary... but we don't need one.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Whispering to Jake''] Dude, look at 'er.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''Messily slathering custard on her face''] Mmm... Oh, Glob...}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, it's sad. Come on. We've gotta help 'er.}}
{{L|[''Jake hesitates speaking for a moment'']}}
{{L|Jake| Alright, LSP. Come inside.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Awesome. [''Recording herself''] Totally nailed the interview. [''Licks custard off face'']}}
{{L|[''The three walk inside.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| I'm gonna need a secretary desk! [''She immediately forces dishes off a table ("Rrr-AAAGH!") and puts her working equipment. Finn and Jake just look at each other.''] I'm starving! What's for dinner?!}}
{{L|Finn| Oh. Uh... [''Checks fridge''] We got some blueberries.}}
{{L|Jake| Jake has saltines.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Yuck. [''Recording herself''] Looks like I'll have to bust out these cobras to get a better dinner. [''Seductively''] Hey, Finn... [''Rubbing her lumps''] You got anything ''better'' to eat??}}
{{L|Finn| [''Focused on the fridge''] Oh, cool. Old spaghetti. I'm gonna go heat this up. [''Exits'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''Recording herself''] Chapter 1: "Gotcha!"}}
{{L|[''Scene changes to that night.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''To Lumpy Space Princess''] Have a good night. See ya in the mornin'.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| G'night, you guys! [''They go upstairs.''] [''Recording herself''] Finn is even more overpowered by my lumps than I thought. I guess at the end of the day, it's all about the lumps. [''Her phone rings (Lumpy Space Princess's ringtone is Turtle Princess saying, "Heeey, girl!" repeatedly) and she answers it.'']}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| [''On other end''] Hey, girl.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, Turtle Princess! This book is coming out ''awesome''!}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Oh, good, girl! I can't wait to read it!}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Thanks, girl.}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Goodnight, girl.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Goodnight, girl. [''Hangs up'']}}
{{L|[''Scene shifts to the next morning. Lumpy Space Princess wakes up grunting and drooling.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| What's that?}}
{{L|[''Lumpy Space Princess goes outside to find Finn putting rocks in Jake.'']}}
{{L|Jake| 'Sup, LSP?}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| What're you guys doing?}}
{{L|Finn| We're carrying these rocks on an adventure, up to the [[Mystery Mountains]].}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, nuh-uh, I am ''not'' gonna carry rocks!}}
{{L|Finn| That's okay. Jake can carry 'em.}}
{{L|Jake| Yup.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Ugh... Fine... [''Picks up two rocks''] You're welcome, Finn.}}
{{L|[''Finn gives a thumbs up. The trio starts going to the mountains.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Ugh... My arms weren't meant to carry so many rocks, you guys!}}
{{L|Finn| C'mon, LSP. You can make it.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Uuoohhh... [''Drops the rocks in exhaustion; her phone rings ("Heeey, girl! Heeey, girl!") and she answers.''] Turtle Princess, you can't call me! You're gonna blow my cover!}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Good morning, girl.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Good morning, girl.}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Would you be mad at me if I ask out Billy, that vulture who was hitting on you? I think he's cute and I would—}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, LSP, shake a leg.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''Whisper''] Can't talk right now, girl! [''Hangs up'']}}
{{L|[''The trio arrives at the top of one of the mountains.'']}}
{{L|Finn| The [[Loch of Phantoms]]. Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the ''safe'' path. [''Starts throwing rocks into the lake'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''To herself''] This is way too boring for my book. [''Acting''] Oh... my shoulder strap... Oh, my orange juice is comin' out... Ha! Gotch—Huh? [''Finn throws another rock in, paying no attention to her.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Haha! Jake! "Ker-ploop."}}
{{L|Jake| Heh heh heh! "Ker-ploop."}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| ''Not''... gotcha?}}
{{L|[''Finn throws another rock in the lake, and the rock stays on the lake's surface.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Alright!}}
{{L|[''Finn throws a bunch more rocks in to determine which path to walk in. The trio enters the cave opposite them. Sludge falls on Lumpy Space Princess.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Ugh! This place is ''plops'', Finn!}}
{{L|Finn| We can meetcha back at the tree house later if you want. [''Continuing on''] That weird light...}}
{{L|[''The trio eventually stops in front of a strange vortex.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Hey, ''Finn''! Finn, my dress is slipping!!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Not paying attention''] Huh? Listen, LSP, we've gotta be carefu—}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess|[''Swinging around her "dress"''] Oooh, my dress...[''her dress goes into the portal'']}}
{{L|[''She drifts into the portal.'']}}
{{L|Finn| No, LSP! It's not safe!}}
{{L|[''Lumpy Space Princess gets trapped in a room full of mirrors.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Heeeeeeey... [''Noticing [[Mirror Finns|Finn]] in a mirror''] Oh. Hey, Fiiiiinn...}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake bang on the wall.'']}}
{{L|Finn| She's ''stuck'' in there!}}
{{L|Jake| We gotta bust through this wall!}}
{{L|[''They attack the wall.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| I knew you couldn't resist me, Finn. [''The reflection of Finn takes off his hat revealing long, luscious hair.''] Oh, lump. I took it too far! [''The Mirror Finns reach out for Lumpy Space Princess''] My powerful lumps have turned Finn into a grody monster! Get away, Finn! AAH, NO, AAAAAH!!! [''Finn and Jake bust in just in time to defeat the shadow Finns.''] OH, I CAN'T LOOK! [''Opens one eye''] Aah!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake finish defeating the shadow Finns and pant heavily.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| That was so crazy! What just ''happened''?!}}
{{L|Finn| Oh. Uh, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors. Evil stuff happens when you look into them.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, Glob... I ''had'' to look because I looked so ''good''!}}
{{L|Finn| LSP... you don't need a mirror to know you look good. [''Sheaths his sword and grabs Lumpy Space Princess's "dress."''] You're beautiful on the ''inside''. Like... your ''brain'' and stuff!}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Thanks for sayin' that stuff... and for saving me from those mirror-yous. That was pretty nice.}}
{{L|[''Finn smiles. Scene shifts back to the Tree Fort.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Okay. Time to write. Gonna make this... ''trashy''. Turtle Princess'll be all, [''Imitating her''] "Oh, my gosh! Number one best-seller!" Hah... Yeah. [''She looks around with uncertainty and notices Finn sitting on a log outside.''] [''To Jake''] What's he ''doing'' out there?}}
{{L|Jake| Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think. [''Goes upstairs'']}}
{{L|[''Lumpy Space Princess looks at Finn. Her cellphone rings ("Heeey, girl! He—") and she answers.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''Fearful''] Hello?}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Hey, girl. Are you almost done with your book?}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Oh... I'm ''working'' on it! I've been doing so much research!}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Did Finn fall victim to your lumps?}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''Prevaricating''] Um... yeah...}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Great! Bring in your manuscript right away! Click! [''Hangs up'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''To herself''] Yeah... A book about how I'm hot, and Finn only wants... He's so... hot. [''Gasps in realization and has flashbacks of Finn from earlier moments in the episode.''] ...Finn has the hottest lumps, but ''his'' lumps are on the ''inside''! YAAAAGH!! [''Pushes equipment off desk in frustration''] HE'S GREAT!}}
{{L|[''Lumpy Space Princess begins typing a new manuscript. As she's typing, it begins to rain, and Finn runs inside. In response, Lumpy Space Princess hurriedly gathers up her manuscript and leaves as Finn enters.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Uh... Bye, LSP.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to the [[Library]]. Turtle Princess reads the manuscript confused.'']}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| This isn't what you said it'd be about...}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| I know, I—}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| I LOVE IT!}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| OH, MY GLOB!}}
{{L|[''Turtle Princess makes the cover and titles the book "I Wrote a Book." Billy screeches. Back at the Tree Fort, the rain clears, and Lumpy Space Princess returns.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Finn! You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours!}}
{{L|Finn| Oh. Yeah! Yeah, I have.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Finn... I was never really your secretary, Finn. I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps because I'm so ''hot'', Finn!!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Not seeing anything wrong with this''] Oh. Okay.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| But ''you're'' the one who's hot, Finn!!}}
{{L|Finn| ''Wow.'' Uh, ''thanks''!}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| No... thank ''you''. [''Goes over to a window and opens it to exit'']}}
{{L|Jake| LSP, YOU'RE WEARING ''GARBAGE'' FOR CLOTHES!!!!}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''Whisper''] Gotcha... [''Slowly exits and floats away from the tree house. Her floating falters for a moment as the episode ends.'']}}
