{{L|Jake| Let me see. Wow, that's a tiny splinter.}}
{{L|Finn| But it hurts! I'm gonna need some... [''Flashes to a different scene with a thimble on Finn's finger''] ...''finger'' protection! Thanks, Choose Goose.''}}
{{L|[[Choose Goose]]| I am Choose Goose. Come back for some juice! Ha ha ha ha ha!}}
{{L|Finn| Man, I am ''so'' protected right now!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake hear [[knights]] talking.'']}}
{{L|Knight 1| That is mighty thick. Go on, hit me! [''Another knight hits him with a sword and it breaks in half. They clap. Knight 2 makes an okay sign with his fingers and the other knights cheer.'']}}

{{L|Jake| This dude. [''Points at Finn'']}}

{{L|[''Knights laughing'']}}
{{L|One knight| Protect his butt! Protect his butt!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Cheeks turn more red''] No, Choose Goose. I want--}}
{{L|Choose Goose| Don't be meek. What if you fall down and scrape your cheek?}}
{{L|[''Knights continue to laugh'']}}
{{L|One knight| Look at his butt! [''Falls over''] Look at his butt!}}
{{L|[''Choose Goose cackles.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Smacks Choose Goose in the face''] Choose Goose, I want the most [''Makes okay sign with fingers''] Click-click armor you have!}}
{{L|Choose Goose| Ooh, have a look! [''Points at the armors with his foot'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Sees one with a skull on the front golden all around that a silver hat with a golden horseshoe on the top red sleeves black over the sleeves and golden things on the side of the hat.''] I'll take that one! [''Eyes glow'']}}
{{L|Choose Goose| [''Gets the armor Finn wants''] Wonderful! I'll need a trade of equal value. I'll take the head of your dog friend! }}
{{L|Jake| Say what?}}
{{L|Finn| No way! Choose Goose, this stuff is overpriced!}}
{{L|Choose Goose| No money for me? How about a poem for free?}}
{{L|[''Knights laugh some more on the ground and one falls over'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Looks at the knights and, cheeks turning red, looks back at Choose Goose''] A poem?}}
{{L|Choose Goose| If you can decipher the poem and complete the trials, you will receive the magical [[Armor of Zeldron]]. It is foretold to be totally [''makes okay sign with his fingers''] Click-click! }}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Skadow!}}
{{L|Choose Goose| [''Hands Finn the poem''] Your quest begins in the marsh over the hill.}}
{{L|Finn| Ah, yes! I'm gonna get that armor!}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, man, you're gonna do it! [''Starts to go and Sir Slicer shows up'']}}
{{L|Sir Slicer| Good luck exposing your soft, vanilla-strawberry skin to the elements, dork! Haaaaaaa! Later, losers! [''Goes away on his horse'']}}
{{L|Finn| Ja! [''Cuts to another scene''] He's just jealous that I'm gonna have cooler armor than him!}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, what a bumbleberry!}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Whoa! [''Comes to a [[Swamp of Embarrassment|place with lot of curtains]]'']}}
{{L|Jake| What's the poem say?}}
{{L|Finn| "The sun nibbles on the clouds, and gum drop tears rain down." I don't get it...}}
{{L|Jake| [''Feels the poem''] Hmm... It means that we have to cross that swamp.}}
{{L|Finn| How'd you understand that?}}
{{L|Jake| You don't just read the poetry to understand it. You got to [''feels it''] ''feel'' it. Trust me, dude-- I'm smarter than everyone. Now get in there!}}
{{L|Finn| You're not coming?}}
{{L|Jake| No way, man. This armor thing is your deal! [''Jake stretches over''] I'll wait for you on the other side.}}
{{L|Finn| [''starts walking in the swamp''] This place will be a piece of... [''moves a curtain and sees an old lady taking a shower'']}}
{{L|Old Lady| Aah!}}
{{L|Finn| Aaaaah!!![''face turns red''] Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry! [''covers his face closes that curtain and opens another curtain, sees another old lady taking a shower''] Aaaaaaaaah!!!}}
{{L|Old Lady| Oh, no! [''An [[Phil|old guy]] walks in'']}}
{{L|Old Guy| [''drops his soap when he sees Finn''] My most private parts peeped by a boy!}}
{{L|Finn| Huuuh!!! [''Closes that one and opens another curtain and sees a mom giving a baby a shower'']}}
{{L|The Mom| Aah! Pervert!}}
{{L|Finn| I'm not a pervert! [''face turns more red'']}}
{{L|The Mom| You should be ashamed of yourself!}}
{{L|Finn| I'm sorry! I'm sorry! [''his whole face turns red and goes through lots of other curtains and finally gets to Jake. Finn breathes hard''] Aah!}}
{{L|Man| My privates!}}
{{L|Finn| I'm sorry!}}
{{L|Man 2| My privates!}}
{{L|Finn| I'm sorry!}}
{{L|Jake| You okay, man?}}
{{L|Finn| No! [''Sir Slicer shows up'']}}
{{L|Sir Slicer| Ha ha ha ha ha!}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Wha?!}}
{{L|Sir Slicer| What's the matter, crimson cheeks? Feeling a little embarrassed in the swamp of embarrassment? [''Camera turns to Finn''] You're so red, you look like a tomato. Ha ha ha ha! [''Sir Slicer leaves on his horse'']}}
{{L|Finn| Aahhhh! We'll see who's embarrassed when I get that armor! What does the poem say?}}
{{L|Jake| [''feels the poem''] Hmm... Ooh! "The meadow weeps as morning sings of milk and honey and things to come."}}
{{L|Finn| What does that even mean?!}}
{{L|Jake| It means we have to silence the echoing in the woods. [''they hear echoing and look over a bush to see what it was'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Huh! [''They see a [[Red-faced Monster]] crying'']}}
{{L|Finn| Aw, man! I don't know how to silence ''that''!}}
{{L|Jake| All right, I'll handle this one, dude. }}
{{L|Finn| No. This is my burden.}}
{{L|Jake| Then just make her think it's ''her'' idea. That's how you make the ladies do what you want.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Walks up to the animal''] Hey, Monster Lady! Hey! Stop crying!}}
{{L|The Animal| Huh?}}
{{L|Finn| Stop crying because that's what ''you'' want to do!}}
{{L|The Animal| Hu ha huh? [''picks Finn up and smiles'']}}
{{L|Finn| Huh?! Ahh!!! Ahh!!! Ahh ahh ahh!!! Ahh ahh!!! [''The monster pictures Finn as her baby'']}}
{{L|The Animal| Oho... [''cradling Finn back and forth'']}}
{{L|Jake| Ha ha ha! She thinks you're her red-faced baby or something. I think she wants ya to nurse, dude! }}
{{L|Finn| Noo!!!}}
{{L|The Animal| Aaa! Ooh! Mmm! [''then Sir Slicer shows up'']}}
{{L|Jake| Huh?}}
{{L|Sir Slicer| [[Lyre Player|Minstrel]]? [''A lyre player comes out and sings "[[Finn the Blushing Baby]]"'']}}
{{L|Minstrel| "He's Finn the blushing baby / His cheeks are bright and red! / Be sure to make fun of him before you go to bed!" }}
{{L|Sir Slicer| Grandfathers will sing that to their grandchildren for generations to come.}}
{{L|Finn| Grandfathers will ''not'' sing that to their children! [''The monster tries to chop Sir Slicer but he puts up his arm which had armor and hurt the monster's hand'']}}
{{L|The Animal| Oh!}}
{{L|Sir Slicer| Armor, [''Makes okay sign with his fingers''] Click-click. [''He leaves on his horse'']}}
{{L|Finn| Just wait till I have the Armor of Zeldron!}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah! Just you wait, weirdo! [''Just then, a shadow cast over Jake''] Uh, Finn? Uh-oh. [''the monster laid on Jake to take a nap'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake? You okay? Huh? [''just then Jake's arm came out of the fur on the animal right in front of Finn and came out the fur on the animals back'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Yeah!}}
{{L|Finn| Awesome!}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah!}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Whoa! [''They came to a door that says "Home of Zeldron's Armor"'']}}
{{L|Finn| Finally! [''kicks the door open''] Yah! [''A [[Ghost Man|ghost]] appears'']}}
{{L|Ghost Man| Hello!}}
{{L|Finn| Begone, ghost! I'm here for the armor!}}
{{L|Ghost Man| First, you have to beat my high score in a game of [[Drop Ball]] [''throwing the ball in the air'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Drop Ball?}}
{{L|Ghost Man| Drop Ball is an extremely addictive, high-intensity game designed for people everywhere. Here, let me show ya. [''He throws the ball under him, bends down, and picks it up with his butt''] Hut! One point. [''Finn's face turns red''] Two points. Three points.}}
{{L|Finn| This game looks awful.}}
{{L|Ghost Man| Oh, no. I absolutely disagree!}}
{{L|Finn| [''to Jake''] Dude, let's just kill him and get the armor.}}
{{L|Jake| How? He's already dead.}}
{{L|Ghost Man| Here. It's your turn. Now, I don't want you to be intimidated, but my high score is six!}}
{{L|Finn| Guh! Just -- just toss it on the ground. [''He throws the ball under Finn, he put his arms on the ground and tries but couldn't go that low'']}}
{{L|Ghost Man| No, no, no! You're doing it all wrong! Let me show you how the pros do it! [''He bends his knees and picks it up''] See? It's all in the technique. Now, I'm gonna put a little finesse into it, just to shake things up. [''Finn and Jake go to the next room while his back is turned'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Whoa! [''they see a big shiny light'']}}
{{L|Jake| Finn, its so beautiful!}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah -- guess all the embarrassment was worth it. [''Then orbs of the light come out'']}}
{{L|Orb| Greetings, young traveler. We know what you seek, and you shall receive it. [''The light struck Finn putting him in the air''] Behold -- the Armor of Zeldron! It will protect you from evil, even ghosts. [''Then the light put it on Finn'']}}
{{L|Finn| Huh?! Aah!! [''Which he found out it was a woman's armor''] No! Dude, this is lady armor!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Makes okay sign with fingers''] Click-click!}}
{{L|Orb| [''Makes okay sign with fingers''] Click-click!}}
{{L|Finn| No! Not Click-click! No more embarrassment! [''He takes it off''] I don't need armor! }}
{{L|Ghost Man| [''Kicks door open''] You did not watch my Drop-Ball technique!}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Huh?}}
{{L|Ghost Man| I give you firsthand tips that no one else knows, and this is how you thank me?! I absolutely disagree with that! [''turns in to a monster-like creature''] Raarg!}}
{{L|Finn| Now what?}}
{{L|Jake| Put on the armor! It'll protect you from evil, even ghosts!}}
{{L|Finn| Never! Yaaaaaaah! [''Finn runs up to the monster ghost, tries to punch him but goes through him'']}}
{{L|Monster Ghost| [''Picks Finn up and starts to take his soul'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hey! }}
{{L|Monster Ghost| Huh?}}
{{L|[''Camera moves to Jake, wearing the Armor of Zeldron'']}}
{{L|Monster Ghost| Mama?}}
{{L|Jake| Uhh... Yeah! [''In a high pitched voice''] Listen when your mother is speaking to you!}}
{{L|Monster Ghost| Yes, Mama.}}
{{L|Jake| [''High pitched voice''] You should be ashamed of yourself -- a boy your age sitting in this cave alone for thousands of years. You need to go outside and get some sunlight!}}
{{L|Monster Ghost| But I...}}
{{L|Jake| [''High pitched voice and is pointing''] No back talk! Outside! ''Now!''}}
{{L|Monster Ghost| [''Puts Finn down and the monster ghost goes outside, burns from sunlight and then turns back to a normal person'']}}
{{L|Finn| Whoa.}}
{{L|Person| Oh, thank you, Finn and Jake! You've freed me from the addiction of Drop Ball! }}
{{L|Jake|[''normal voice''] No problem, dude. I couldn't have done it without [''pointing up''] ''the power of embarrassment!''}}
{{L|Finn| And I learned I don't need armor to be -- [''Sir Slicer shows up'']}}
{{L|Sir Slicer| Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Look at you losers. Finn, you don't have any armor, and your friend is dressed like a lady! Ha ha ha! So not Click-click! }}
{{L|Finn| Well, at least I don't spend my day following a kid around! Get a life, dude! }}
{{L|Person and Jake| Ha ha ha ha}}
{{L|Jake| Good one, Finn.}}
{{L|Person| Yeah ha ha.}}
{{L|Sir Slicer| Well, I've... just been in the same areas today. }}
{{L|Person & Jake| Ha ha ha ha ha ha!}}
{{L|Person| Yeah, right!}}
{{L|Jake| Whatever!}}
{{L|Sir Slicer| Be quiet! I -- I am more Click-click than all of you!}}
{{L|Finn| Come over here and say that to my fist!}}
{{L|Sir Slicer| Okay, I will! [''Gets down from his horse, falls down and lands on side''] Whoa! Er... Ugh, this armor's too heavy! Ah, no problem. I'll just prop myself up on this stick. [''Grabs a stick''] Aghhh! Splinter!}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, Sir Slicer, maybe you can use ''this!'' [''He holds up the thimble''] Here you go! [''Throws it at Sir Slicer's face'']}}
{{L|Sir Slicer| Oh!}}
{{L|Finn| Free of charge!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Picks up Finn with his butt and flings him on his back''] Come on, dude, let's get out of here.}}
{{L|Finn| Ha ha! [''Cheeks turn red''] Okay, buddy. }}
{{L|Jake| [''Flies over Sir Slicer with the armor''] Wa-hoo! [''Flies over the 3 mountain tops, breaking them''] Dude, this armor is totally Click-click!}}
