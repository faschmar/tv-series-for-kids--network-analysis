{{L|[''The episode begins with [[Finn]] and [[Jake]] in the [[Library]] carrying [[Rainicornicopia|an enormous book]].'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''grunting'']}}
{{L|Finn| It's slippin', dude.}}
{{L|[''They groan as they set it down on a table.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Phew. [''reading title''] Raini-corni-copia? An Unabridged History of the Rainicorns. [''yawns''] Whatever, man. I barely even made it through the title.}}
{{L|Jake| Listen, man. One day, I'm probably gonna have [[Jake and Lady's offspring (disambiguation)|half-rainbow pupsters]]. I gotta be able to share my babies' culture.}}
{{L|[''They open the book.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''mumbling indistinctly as he reads'']}}
{{L|[''Finn rocks the table.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Huh. [''goes under the table''] Oh. [''comes out from underneath it''] Hey, this table is wobbly. We gotta take it to the [[Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain]] to fix it.}}
{{L|Jake| Dude, I would love to go on some crazy, made-up adventure with you, but I ''really'' gotta read this. So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you. [''continues reading and mumbling'']}}
{{L|Finn| I don't make up adventures! Jake, you know that! Jake! I don't make up adventures! [''lifts and drops the end of the table a few times''] Hm. [''leaves Jake and walks past some shelves''] Books, books. [''reading titles''] Kitties, Zitties, Witties, Mitties, Knitties, Fitties, Hitties, Jitties, Pities, Cities... [''comes to some books with damaged spines''] Oh, no! Damaged books? Who did this?!}}
{{L|[[Turtle Princess]]| Shhhhhhhushh!}}
{{L|Finn| Sorry. [''to books''] I will avenge thee, slightly-soiled books. Gotta tell Jake.}}
{{L|[''He starts walking back when he sees some books shake.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hello? [''looks behind books''] Is someone back here? Are you stuck?}}
{{L|Turtle Princess| Shhhushmm!}}
{{L|Finn| [''quietly''] Hello? [''pages start coming out of the books''] Whoa! Ohhh! Hey, there's pages comin' outta these books!}}
{{L|People offscreen| SHHHHHH!}}
{{L|[''The pages fold themselves into [[Pagelings]].'']}}
{{L|Finn| Who are you dudes?}}
{{L|Pagelings| We are the Pagelings!}}
{{L|[[Paper Pete (character)|Paper Pete]]| I am Paper Pete, the leader of the Pagelings. But ''you'' can call me P.P.}}
{{L|Finn| I'll call you Pete.}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Okay!}}
{{L|Finn| Why are you dudes in the library?}}
{{L|Paper Pete| We are the secret guardians of the books in the library. You know those blank pieces of paper in the beginning of old books?}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah?}}
{{L|Paper Pete| That's us! We revealed ourselves to you, noble giant, because you felt our plight when you saw the damaged books. And now is our darkest hour, for the [[Moldos]] have been growing more bold with every attack. Look at the damage done yesterday [''pulls out a damaged book''] at the Battle of [[Teddy Bear Joke Book]].}}
{{L|Finn| Wow, yeah.}}
{{L|Paper Pete| They're massing for a full-scale assault on every book in the library!}}
{{L|Finn| Gosh! Even the Rainicornicopia?}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Yes.}}
{{L|Finn| I better tell Jake. Don't you dudes go anywhere.}}
{{L|Pagelings| Okay.}}
{{L|[''Finn runs back to Jake.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, bro, I've got an adventure—and it's not made up! There are these- these Pagelings they came out from- from books! And they- they folded into little animals.}}
{{L|[''Jake [[Stretchy Powers|stretches]] his foot onto Finn's mouth.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Do you hear what I'm saying?!}}
{{L|Jake| [''shakes head''] Shhhh!}}
{{L|Finn| You think I'm making this up?}}
{{L|Jake| [''nods''] [''motions for Finn to go away'']}}
{{L|Finn| I'll prove it to you! [''drags the Rainicornicopia off the table onto the floor and starts dragging it away'']}}
{{L|Jake| Finn! [''following Finn''] Finn, you butt chicken!}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, wait till you see 'em.}}
{{L|[''Jake tackles Finn and they bump against the bookshelf with the Pagelings, who retreat into the shelf as books fall off the shelf on top of Finn and Jake.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Ow.}}
{{L|Jake| [''grunts and strains as he lifts the Rainicornicopia and drags it back'']}}
{{L|Finn| They were just here! Pagelings?}}
{{L|[''The Pagelings reappear.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Why didn't you dudes introduce yourselves to Jake?}}
{{L|Paper Pete| We don't want to reveal ourselves to anyone else. We are the ''secret'' guardians. ''Secret''.}}
{{L|Finn| Ummmm... yeah, but Jake is a powerful giant like me! He can help you battle or- or whatevs! But first, you must win his favor. Do you not want victory for your people?}}
{{L|Pagelings| Yes! We do want victory!}}
{{L|Finn| C'mon, follow me. [''he leads them to Jake''] Jake, look.}}
{{L|[''Jake buries his face in the book.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''to Pagelings''] He's up here reading a book.}}
{{L|[''The Pagelings climb onto the table.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Do something to get his attention.}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Very well. We shall dance as flowers.}}
{{L|Other Pagelings| Hoo-ah!}}
{{L|Finn| Okay.}}
{{L|[''The Pagelings turn into flowers and start dancing around Jake, who is hiding his face behind his hands.'']}}
{{L|Pagelings| [''grunt and sing indistinctly as they dance'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, the Pagelings are dancing for you. Just look up for a second!}}
{{L|[''Jake stretches his face out from underneath his hands as the Pagelings dance outside his field of vision.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Finn, all the little voices you're doing are cute, but come on, man! Just let me read. [''buries his face again'']}}
{{L|[''The Pagelings jump onto Jake's head and transform back to normal.'']}}
{{L|Paper Pete| By wearing the beast, [''they rip off some fur''] we shall become like the beast. [''they place the fur on their heads'']}}
{{L|Finn| You can feel them, can't you?}}
{{L|Jake| I can feel ''you'' pinching me.}}
{{L|Finn| Just look up for a second! [''trying to lift up Jake''] Looooook. [''gives up''] Uhhh. Pagelings, I'm sorry, but my friend is acting like a clump.}}
{{L|Pagelings| Okay.}}
{{L|Paper Pete| We can't wait any longer. We must go back to the bookshelf to prepare for the Moldos' attack}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else!}}
{{L|Finn| I'm not making believe!}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Paper Pete.'']}}
{{L|Paper Pete| [''gasps''] We were gone too long!}}
{{L|[''Some Moldos are shown eating books and Finn is standing nearby.'']}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Wield, my brethren. Wield!}}
{{L|[''They charge at the Moldos.'']}}
{{L|Pagelings| [''battle cries'']}}
{{L|[''They start fighting the Moldos weakly and calmly.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''yawns and exhales, blowing the Moldos and Pagelings off their feet'']}}
{{L|Moldo| You win ''this'' battle, but next time, ''we'' will win.}}
{{L|[''The Moldos retreat.'']}}
{{L|Pagelings| Yes, leave! Victory! Veni, vidi, vici!}}
{{L|Finn| So, those little squishy guys are the Moldos?}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Aye. This was but a reconnaissance squad... sent to test our mettle!}}
{{L|Pagelings| Mettle!}}
{{L|Finn| Uh-huh. They seem tough.}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Their bites sting like the Dickens.}}
{{L|Finn| Hmmm... their bites sting, eh? I've got a plan, Pete.}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Tell me your plan, giant.}}
{{L|Finn| Just trust me. [''picks up Paper Pete''] Trust me.}}
{{L|[''Some Moldos are seen slithering past some shelves. Finn, with Paper Pete on his shoulder, peeks around the corner and sees them enter a bookshelf on the far wall. He runs toward the shelf and removes some books.'']}}
{{L|Paper Pete| You've discovered the [[Moldos' Secret Lair]]!}}
{{L|Finn| Eh, it wasn't very hard.}}
{{L|[''Finn crawls through to the Moldos' lair. There are crystals growing on the walls, but no Moldos in sight.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Wibba-wibba-wah!}}
{{L|[''Scream echoes and several Moldos appear.'']}}
{{L|Moldo| The Pagelings have a battle beast! Attack!}}
{{L|Moldos| [''battle cries'']}}
{{L|Finn| Whoa. Whoa, moldy blobs. I've come here to help the Moldos defeat the Pagelings.}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Traitor! [''brandishing paper sword''] Hiyah! Yah!}}
{{L|Finn| [''quietly''] Calm down, this is part of my plan.}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Ohhh, ha-ha! Then I shall play along, wise giant. [''winks'']}}
{{L|Moldo| How are we to trust you?}}
{{L|Finn| Well... here, look. [''takes Paper Pete off his shoulder''] I brought you all a prisoner. It's their leader.}}
{{L|Paper Pete| May you rot in {{w|Tartarus}}! May your skin boil and eyes burst into flames... forever in a pit! [''winks'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''winks'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Paper Pete being lifted up in a cage made of pencils and rulers.'']}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Traitor!}}
{{L|Finn| So, do you guys have, like, a—like, a leader or somethin'?}}
{{L|Moldos| [''murmuring and whispering''] [[Mildwin]].}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Mildwin.}}
{{L|Mildwin| I'm Mildwin, leader of the Moldos.}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, uhh... hmm. [''gets down on the floor''] Nice to meet you, your highness.}}
{{L|Mildwin| I'm not a king; I was democratically elected.}}
{{L|Finn| [''laughs''] That's adorable. [''beat''] Now, Finn! [''grabs Mildwin and several Moldos, kicks apart Paper Pete's cage, and runs out of the lair'']}}
{{L|Moldo| Protect the elected official!}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Well played, ol' giant. [''winks''] You have the cunning of {{w|Odysseus}}. [''winks several times'']}}
{{L|Finn| Pete, j-just stop winking. [''jumps on top of a table and onto bookshelf''] Hyah!}}
{{L|People| Shhhh!}}
{{L|[''Finn jumps down from the bookshelf near Jake.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Ignore ''this''! [''throws the Moldos at Jake'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hmm?}}
{{L|[''The Moldos start eating Jake's fur.'']}}
{{L|Mildwin| Mmm! This tastes delicious! [''chomps on a bit of Jake's flesh'']}}
{{L|Jake| AAAAH! AAH!}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!}}
{{L|Jake| What did you do to me?! AAAAAAH!}}
{{L|Finn| Ummm...}}
{{L|Jake| AH! AAAH!}}
{{L|Finn| Uhhh... come on, you guys, knock it off.}}
{{L|Moldo| [''hisses at Finn'']}}
{{L|Finn| The Moldos got a taste for ya now.}}
{{L|Jake| [''screams in pain'']}}
{{L|Finn| Gotta do something. Where can I find ways to solve problems in a library? [''sees a poster''] "Books"? [''gets a book and starts hitting Jake with it''] Books! Books! Books!}}
{{L|Jake| Aaah!}}
{{L|Finn| [''sees a Moldo eating his shirt''] Huh? Whatcha nibblin' ''me'' for?}}
{{L|Moldo| This sweaty stuff tastes amazing. ''A-mazing''!}}
{{L|Finn| Hmmm. Tastier than battle beast fur. Yis! [''takes off his shirt'']}}
{{L|[''He notices that Turtle Princess saw this. Turtle Princess blushes and runs back to her cart of books.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, Mildwin. Mildwin!}}
{{L|Mildwin| What?}}
{{L|Finn| I bring a peace offering from the Pagelings.}}
{{L|Mildwin| Hmm?}}
{{L|[''The Moldos sniff the shirt, crawl onto it, and start eating, except for two, which are latched onto Jake's closed eyelids.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Finn... what's happening?}}
{{L|Finn| Hang on, buddy. Paper Pete?}}
{{L|[''Paper Pete flies in in the form of a paper plane, lands on Finn's shoulder, and transforms back to normal.'']}}
{{L|Paper Pete| Giant! Have you wiped out the Moldo horde?}}
{{L|Finn| Naw, man. The war's over. [''pokes Mildwin''] Mildwin, you can keep my shirt if [''points to Paper Pete''] you don't attack their library books.}}
{{L|Mildwin| Agreed, beast. This filthy garb will feed my people for generations.}}
{{L|Finn| And in forty years, you can have my shorts. Sound good, Pete?}}
{{L|Paper Pete| It will suffice.}}
{{L|Finn| Sound good, Jake?}}
{{L|Jake| [''pulls the remaining two Moldos off his eyes''] AAAH! What—What the hecks, man?! What'd you do to me?!}}
{{L|Finn| [''holds up his shirt''] Look, man! Moldos and Pagelings are real!}}
{{L|Jake| Wha—? Who cares, man?! I'm outta here!}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Finn and Jake walking away from the library.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Did you finish your Rainicorn book?}}
{{L|Jake| Ugh... I was readin' the same paragraph over and over for, like, eleven minutes. I guess I'm gonna give up on learnin' everything about Rainicorn history. Don't tell [[Lady Rainicorn|Lady]].}}
{{L|Finn| Oh. What about relating to your mixed-species kids?}}
{{L|Jake| Eh, I'll just fake it.}}
{{L|Finn| Oh. Well... hey, man, I think I see some, um... [''points to the sun''] Sun People in trouble on the sun over there.}}
{{L|Jake| You makin' that up?}}
{{L|Finn| Mmhmm.}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah! Let's do it! [''starts running toward the setting sun'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''follows Jake''] WHOO! WHOOOO!}}
