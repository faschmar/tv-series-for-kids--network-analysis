{{L|[[Princess Bubblegum]]|I can't believe I let you talk me into this. It's not like I have a lot of free time, you know.}}
{{L|[[Marceline]]|Peebs, you work too much. Imagine a pizza. Only half should be business. The rest should be personal. Personal pizza.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Yuck.}}
{{L|Marceline|Try to have fun tonight.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|With the Ice King? Not in your everlasting lifetime, girlfriend.}}
{{L|Marceline|I wish you'd call him ''Simon''. He's actually kind of sweet and funny.}}
{{L|Marceline|Can you please try to get along tonight? It would mean a lot to me.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|I'll try.}}
{{L|[[Ice King]]|Try anything once, that's what I say.}}
{{L|Marceline|Simon! What's this?}}
{{L|Ice King|It's a present. To bribe you for coming over.}}
{{L|Marceline|You don't have to bribe us, silly. We're here because we want to hang out with you.}}
{{L|Ice King|No one has ever said that to me before. You didn't say, "No take backs."}}
{{L|Marceline|Bottoms down.}}
{{L|Ice King|So, check it out! I upgraded my home karaoke system. Do you like karaoke?}}
{{L|Marceline|Duh! We love karaoke. Bonnie is a dynamo on the mike! Okay. You guys get started, I'll freshen up PB's drink.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Marceline?}}
{{L|Ice King|Irslerskat prjon! Prjon, prjon Prrrrrrrrrrrrjon!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Marceline! Get out here quick!}}
{{L|Marceline|What's going on?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Something's wrong with the I.K.}}
{{L|Marceline|No! Simon!}}
{{L|Ice King|Hi, Marceline.}}
{{L|Marceline|Are you guys pranking me?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Your friend just majorly malfunctioned! He was jerking around all weird, and his voice sounded like he was possessed!}}
{{L|Marceline|Cool out, B-Bell. I know you love karaoke, but you can't take it so seriously.}}
{{L|Ice King|I hope you like penguin cuisine. It's mostly just shapes.}}
{{L|Marceline|Who doesn't love a good rhomboid?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|You're a rhomboid.}}
{{L|Marceline|Here, Simon. I know these are your favos.}}
{{L|Ice King|Thanks, ''Gunther''!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|He just called you "Gunther."}}
{{L|Marceline|He calls everybody Gunther. Bonnie!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|There's something really wrong with Simon.}}
{{L|Marceline|There's some wrong with Wait. You just called him Simon.}}
{{L|Ice King|Call me whatever you want. This is the best date I've been on since my last date.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|This is not a date.}}
{{L|Ice King|Neither was the last one. It was a robbery.}}
{{L|Marceline|For real?}}
{{L|Ice King|Yeah. She stole my heart. And [[Ice King's crown|my crown]].}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Your crown.}}
{{L|Marceline|Crubs! He's really flipping out! [''PB strikes on IK's head with an icicle''] What'd you do that for?!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|It just makes things easier.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|I'm definitely seeing some weird activity here. It's really, really.}}
{{L|Marceline|You don't know what's going on.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Maybe I can access it with my VR equipment.}}
{{L|Marceline|Whoa, Bon-bon! This stuff is rad. Why haven't you shown me before?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|I didn't think you liked science.}}
{{L|Marceline|I like games.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|We can play sometime. But this time, it's business.}}
{{L|Marceline|Whoa.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|This is not what I was expecting.}}
{{L|Marceline|Did you press the wrong button?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|I never press the wrong button.}}
{{L|Marceline|Yeah, you always know which ''button'' to press. I'm referring to the fact that you know how to annoy me.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Yeah, I got that. What I don't get is this stupid scenery.}}
{{L|Marceline|At least it's got a pretty killer beat.}}
{{L|[[Gunther|Gunther (Evergreen)]]|Wow! Two newbies at the same time! How'd you manage that? Yeah, okay. I guess if you really squeeze together, it could fit you both.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Who are you?!}}
{{L|Marceline|Are you a dinosaur?}}
{{L|Gunther|I'm a Gunther.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Okay, what's a dinosaur doing here?}}
{{L|Gunther|I'm practicing my drums. The others say the acoustics out here are better than in town.}}
{{L|Marceline|What the bleep?!}}
{{L|Gunther|Yeah. That's been happening lately. You're lucky you didn't get rearranged. Ooof!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Does this circuit look infected to you?}}
{{L|Marceline|I don't know. I only deal in infectious grooves.}}
{{L|Gunther|Sounds like you guys need another brain. I'm gonna take you guys to the [[Ice King|the professor]]! He's the smartest guy I know. Next to [[Urgence Evergreen|Master Evergreen]], of course.}}
{{L|[[Sveinn]]|Prjon.}}
{{L|Gunther|Hey, guys.}}
{{L|Sveinn|Prjon. Hey, Goontz!}}
{{L|Marceline|Who are those dudes?}}
{{L|Gunther|That's Sveinn. He only wore the crown once. And the guy next to him says he's the first "Santa." Like, what's even a "Santa"?}}
{{L|Marceline|Dude, the Santa?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.}}
{{L|Gunther|Aha! There he is! Professor Petrikov!}}
{{L|Marceline|Simon!}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Marcy! Dear! How is this possible? Did my beloved [[Betty Grof|Betty]] master the secrets of the crown?}}
{{L|Marceline|No. Bonnibel scienced us in.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|You must be Betty's little assistant.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Assistant?! I have been my own boss my entire life. I built my own lab! I've created freaking life forms!}}
{{L|Marceline|Okay! Actually, I haven't seen Betty since she came back to Ooo.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|But if Betty didn't send you, why are you here?}}
{{L|Marceline|The crown is going ba-nay-nays.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|It's making Ice King act super weird in the real world.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Yes, I see. It seems to have infected much of the crown's labyrinth. I was actually just about to follow its path of destruction.}}
{{L|Gunther|A quest!}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Hey, Marcy, last time, I was so caught up in making things right with Betty that you got left out. I'm sorry.}}
{{L|Marceline|It's okay. I get it.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|So, you got a boyfriend yet?}}
{{L|Marceline|Ha! No. There was [[Ash|this guy]] once, but he was a real jerk, so I dumped him hard.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Wish I'd been there to punch his face.}}
{{L|Marceline|Simon! I can punch my own jerks now.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|It's getting pretty bad. I think we're close.}}
{{L|Gunther|Yeah! Can't you hear my intense drumming?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Magic Man?}}
{{L|[[Betty Grof|Betty (A.I.)]]|Magic ''Woman''.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Betty!}}
{{L|Gunther|This is the fabled Betty? I always pictured her more majestic. You know, with, guts and stuff.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Betty, please, what are you doing?}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|I'm re-programming the crown's wish magic. Got to fix Simon. A-ha!}}
{{L|Gunther|I'm a bush!}}
{{L|Marceline|It's just on backwards.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Betty's the one who's backwards. We got to get her malware out of here before she causes irreparable damage.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Now!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Now!}}
{{L|Marceline|Hoo!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Now! Aaah!}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|There has to be a part of the real Betty in there somewhere, Gunther. If only I could reach out to her.}}
{{L|Gunther|Okay. Get in there and reach.}}
{{L|Simon|I think I will. Betty? I'm the reason you're doing all this.}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|I'm busy.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Remember how we met? When we both reached for the same book in the library, and I said you should check it out first? And when you returned it, you left a note inside, because you knew I'd borrow it next? It was the funniest, smartest note I've ever read.}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|I... have to work.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Betty, I love you so much, but you can't help me like this.}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|I can and I will help you, Simon!}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|You remember me!}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|I-I}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Stay with that feeling, Betty! Stay with it! Betty!}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|Simon?}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Betty! I can't believe it's really you!}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|Technically I'm a magical A.I. avatar derived from Betty's memories.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Close enough!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Shwang! The system appears to be stabilizing. Crown shields are coming back online.}}
{{L|Marceline|What does that mean?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|The crown will re-seal itself off from foreign entities.}}
{{L|Marceline|But I-I can come back and visit Simon, right?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|No.}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|What about me?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Don't freak out, but you're gonna be deleted.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Oh, no!}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|It's okay, Simon. I'm just glad I didn't destroy your world.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|You are my world.}}
{{L|Gunther|Goodbye, freaks! Don't forget Gunther!}}
{{L|Marceline|Bye, dude. I'm gonna be nicer to penguins from now on.}}
{{L|Gunther|Okay. Wait, what?}}
{{L|Marceline|Whoa.}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|Before I go, there's something I have to tell you.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Tell me, Betty.}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Betty!}}

{{L|Princess Bubblegum|I'm seeing remnants of Betty's program in the readouts. It's like her data left a shadow print on the circuitry.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|So, what was that thing you were gonna tell me?}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|I just said that for drama. I figured it would drive you crazy, but at least you'd never stop thinking about me.}}
{{L|Simon Petrikov|Betty, I never could.}}
{{L|Betty (A.I.)|Mwah!}}
{{L|Marceline|I don't see anything. These are just weird dots to me.}}
{{L|Ice King|My place is trashed and I can't remember a thing. Great dinner party, huh?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Best I've ever been to. What? I don't like relaxing; I like science.}}
