{{L|[''[[Flame Princess]] slaps [[Finn]], leaving a hand-shaped burn mark on his face.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Don't ever mess with me again!}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess shoots out the window in a trail of fire.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Looks at [[Jake]]''] Who ''was'' that?}}
{{L|Jake| [''Still terrified''] The Princess of the [[Fire Kingdom]]?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Looks out the window, then back at Jake''] Dude, I think I have a crush.}}
{{L|[''Finn walks in front of Jake.'']}}
{{L|Finn| What do you know about her, Jake?}}
{{L|Jake| I was trying to help you get over your [[Princess Bubblegum]] sad times by hooking you two up. But she's evil, man!}}
{{L|Finn| You shut your dirty mouth! [''Slaps Jake. Finn's angry outburst causes the burn mark to disappear'']}}
{{L|Jake| Dirty? [''Checks gums''] Oh. No, really man! Her [[Flame King|dad]] said she was evil!}}
{{L|Finn| Naw, man, I peeped beyond her burning gaze, and noshed hot lunch with her soul. [''Walks to the window''] She ain't evil. She's passionate. Help me track her down.}}
{{L|Jake| Hmmm..}}
{{L|Finn| C'mon, man, I really like her. Help me out. [''Rubs Jake's face''] Jake, Jake help me out. Help me out. Jake, Jake, help me. Jake, Jake, help me!}}
{{L|Jake| Eeeeeeeeehhh, ok.}}
{{L|Finn| Whoo! Alright!}}
{{L|[''The scene cut to Jake walking over trees as a giant with Finn on his head.'']}}
{{L|Jake| You sure you're not into any other princesses? What about [[Wildberry Princess]]? She's small and plump. You could sleep on her like a pillow. Could be nice.}}
{{L|[''Light shines on Finn and Jake as a burning bird flies away.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Is that bird... smoking?}}
{{L|Brown Bird| Hey, don't you judge me. It was that fire chick down there that done this to me.}}
{{L|[''Jake stretches down the bushes as he and Finn hide behind them. They see Flame Princess touching flowers and burning them'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Oh.}}
{{L|[''The fire burns other flowers, spreading towards a lake.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''Gasps'']}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, Jake... look at her. She's innocent. Like the steam off a puppy's nose, searching for ham in the snow.}}
{{L|Jake| Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it! Snap out of it! She's burning cute little flowers!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Focusing on Flame Princess''] Yeah, she ''is'' like a cute little flower.}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess walks towards the lake, kneels and dips her hand in it'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Aaahh!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Comes out of the bush''] Oh, no, are you ok?}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''Gasps'']}}
{{L|Finn| I... I was just worried about you.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Huh?}}
{{L|Finn| Look, I'm sorry about what I said before. I don't know what happened, but I just, I had to see you again. And, I don't know.. I don't know anything about you, [''Flame Princess glows brighter''] but I just, I really like you. You know, you're so... beautiful.}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess glows brightly'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Sees fire beneath him''] Whoa!}}
{{L|[''Finn stomps on fire, but stops when he sees Flame Princess reacting with pain.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Ah!}}
{{L|[''Finn stomps on fire again'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Ow!}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, Glob. Am I hurting you?}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Yes! That's all you've done! [''gasps''] Are you ''trying'' to hurt me?! Is that why you're ''following'' me?!}}
{{L|Finn| I'm not followi-- Well, I guess technically I ''am'' following you.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''Gasps then runs away'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, no wait! [''Chases Flame Princess'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Laughs awkwardly''] I guess now I'm technically chasing you. [''Laughs again'']}}
{{L|[''Jake comes out of the bushes'']}}
{{L|Jake| Finn!}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess burns tree. Tree falls down, blocking Finn and Jake'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hold on! [''Turns into a giant and uses his "buns" to put out the fire on the tree'']}}
{{L|Jake| Eaoww.. Toasty buns. [''Runs off while carrying Finn as they reach the end of the forest'']}}
{{L|Finn| Where are you? I want to chat it up with you! Oh, we lost her!}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess appears as trails of fire then reforms'']}}
{{L|Finn| Whoa.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| I am ambushing you! [''Throws fireball'']}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Aah!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake run around to avoid fireballs'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, I like your fireballs.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Huh? Why do you torment me?}}
{{L|Finn| I'm not trying to. I just like you. I think I... I think I ''like-like'' you. Listen, when I look at you, my brain goes all stupid. And I just wanna hug you, and sit on the couch and play [[BMO]] with you. I can't explain why, but, I never felt this way before and I think we should be together.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| I... [''Smiles, blushes and glows brightly'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Smiles, claps, and laughs in excitement''] Yeah.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Rggh! Enough. You should not toy with the emotions of a fire elemental.}}
{{L|Finn| Wait wait, I really didn't--}}
{{L|Flame Princess|You told me you liked me, and you made my flame grow brighter, but then you put me out, which hurt! [''Throws a big fireball at Finn and Jake'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| You're trying to impede me. ''That'' must be your purpose, ...but fire's purpose is to burn, so I'm going to turn this land into ''my'' fire kingdom!}}
{{L|Finn| No!}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess creates a fire wall as Finn and Jake back away from the fire'']}}
{{L|Jake| She's headed for [[Goblin Kingdom]]! We need to defeat this fiery she-beast!}}
{{L|Finn| I can't fight her, man. I'm still into her!}}
{{L|Jake| Finn, what's more important? Your love for that screwball dame, or being a hero and savin' the lives of innocent goblin folks?}}
{{L|Finn| Rrrrhh.. Being a hero.}}
{{L|Jake| Alright, c'mon! Let's go build fire-proof suits.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to the Tree Fort's garage.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Frantically searching pile of junk''] Uh-uh-uh, I gotta' get back to her.}}
{{L|Jake| Dude, slow down or your fire suit will be junk. [''Sees a bag of bread''] Ooh. Is bags of old bread fire-proof? [''Slightly shoves the bag, showing [[Neptr]].'']}}
{{L|Neptr| Jake, you've found Neptr! I am the ultimate hide-and-seek champion! 15 months, 4 days, 9 hours and you guys did not find me! [''Spins his oven body''] Hahahaha-hahaha.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Whispers to Finn''] Oh, plops, we forgot about the game.}}
{{L|Finn| Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...}}
{{L|Neptr| I missed you, creator.}}
{{L|Finn| And we missed you, too, but Neptr, right now we need you to--}}
{{L|Neptr| To count to 100 while ''you'' hide? 1, 2,.. 3, 4, 5--}}
{{L|[''Finn halts Neptr'']}}
{{L|Finn| Neptr, will you help us build fire-proof suits?}}
{{L|[''Neptr raises his arm'']}}
{{L|Neptr| You cannot tell but I am giving a thumbs up.}}
{{L|[''Neptr raps "[[Working for the Master]]" as he builds Finn and Jake fire-proof suits while the two assist him'']}}
{{L|Neptr| I am finished!}}
{{L|[''The scene cuts to Finn flying with his suit.'']}}
{{L|Finn| I sure hope Flame Princess is okay.}}
{{L|Neptr| Haha, we are as one, creator.}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, you think Flame Princess is okay?}}
{{L|[''Jake rises up as Finn spins to avoid Jake'']}}
{{L|Jake| DUUUUDE! I feel like I can touch the heavens! [''Whispers''] And sock angels!}}
{{L|Finn| We're coming up on the Goblin Kingdom.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake fly above trails of fire as they see the kingdom'']}}
{{L|Finn| There she is.}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess shoots fire on houses'']}}
{{L|Finn| She seems okay.}}
{{L|Goblin| AAAAHH! Wood for sale! Wood on fire for sale!}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess shoots out two lines of fire and turns around'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| It's really starting to come together. Needs more... fire... hmm.}}
{{L|Finn| Flame Princess!}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess turns'']}}
{{L|Finn| Listen, you gotta stop burning the Goblin Kingdom, ...but I don't wanna fight you or hurt you, I swear.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| I've heard this all before. [''Shoots fireballs at Finn and Jake but their suits put out the fireballs. They land in front of Flame Princess'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| You... MEANIE! [''Throws fireball at Finn. The suit deflects the fireball as the latter bounces. Hitting a goblin's cart.'']}}
{{L|Goblin| My cart. I was born in that cart!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Gasp''] I'll put it out! [''Jake runs through cart and crashes into a building.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Ah!}}
{{L|Finn| Aah! Jake didn't mean that!}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess shoots a stream of fire at a building.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Oh... [''Hovers near the fire.''] I need your help Finn! This one's too big! [''Kicks fire'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Ah! Whyyyy?!}}
{{L|Finn| No, Jake, stop. You're hurting her!}}
{{L|Neptr| I will solve this, creator. I will extinguish her using our suit! Foam blaster. [''Neptr raises the suits right arm and retracts the hand into a blaster.''] Hold still, burning lady.}}
{{L|[''Neptr turns the suit around and aims the blaster at Flame Princess'']}}
{{L|Finn| Wha?}}
{{L|Neptr| Locked on target.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Finn holds the blaster with his suit's left hand''] No, Neptr!}}
{{L|Neptr| Yes, creator.}}
{{L|[''Finn turns the suit around, before the blaster fires'']}}
{{L|Finn| NOOOO!}}
{{L|[''The blaster hits Flame Princess's fire'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| AH!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Distressed''] I'm sorry!}}
{{L|[''Neptr lowers the right arm down, hitting Jake with foam as his suit is covered by it.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| That is the last time you hurt me. [''Transforms into her giant form''] RAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!}}
{{L|Finn| My bad, Jake! Turn it off, Neptr!}}
{{L|[''Finn turns to look at Flame Princess'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Gasp'']}}
{{L|Neptr| Oh, my...}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess turns around and burns the whole city.'']}}
{{L|Finn| NO!}}
{{L|Flame Princess| RAAAAAAAAAHH! [''A "tear" comes out from Flame Princess's right eye.'']}}
{{L|Finn| No more... No more! [''Kneels the suit then rips out of his suit and climbs at its top.''] FLAME PRINCESS!}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess walks away'']}}
{{L|Finn| I can't fight her, ...but I can't let her destroy the city... ''I've failed everyone''.}}
{{L|[''Neptr turns'']}}
{{L|Neptr| Not true, creator. You haven't failed Neptr. Even if everyone burns, you'll still have me, creator.}}
{{L|[''Finn looks at Jake, who is moving his own suit's limbs. Jake takes a scoop of the foam and eats it.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Mmm! [''Smiles and gets another scoop.'']}}
{{L|Finn| No. Why can't I just like a girl? [''Finn's tear drops onto Flame Princess's fire.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Ow! [''Looks angrily at Finn. She notices he's crying.''] Huh?}}
{{L|[''Dives as a fire towards Finn while she shrinks her size.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Coughs then faints.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''Touches Finn's tears then jumps back''] Oh.}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess puts all of her fire out.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Gasps for air then coughs; he sees Flame Princess by his side.''] Wah! Did I... do something... cool while I was knocked out?}}
{{L|Flame Princess| I understand now. You're a ''water ''elemental.}}
{{L|Finn| What?}}
{{L|Flame Princess| You're my opposite. You create water.}}
{{L|Finn| What, cry? No, I j--}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Yeah, you cry and cry all the time.}}
{{L|Finn| N-No. I-I don't usually do that.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| That's your power.}}
{{L|Finn| No! N-N-N-NO-NO-NO! [''waves his hands while blushing.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Finn, even if we like each other, we're going to hurt each other.}}
{{L|Finn| No, we don't have to. I can take it... I... I mean, can't we try?}}
{{L|Flame Princess| You would defy nature for me?}}
{{L|Finn| Uh... yeah, whatevs.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Flame Princess hug, Finn tries to bear the pain but pulls away.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Aaah.. Uh.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Bye, Finn. [''Departs'']}}
{{L|Neptr| Goodbye, lady.}}
{{L|Jake| FINN! [''Stretches up.''] Oh my Glob, man. Everyone's dead, man! They're all burned. There's barbecued bods EVERYWHERE!}}
{{L|Finn| WHAAAAT!?!}}
{{L|Jake| Hah. I'm just kidding. I saved 'em. Everyone's fine, see?}}
{{L|[''Jake gestures towards the crowd of unharmed goblins'']}}
{{L|Jake| So. How'd everything go with Flame Princess?}}
{{L|Finn| She hugged me... then left.}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa! How did it feel?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Turns to the direction Flame Princess took while leaving a trail of fire behind.''] It hurt.}}
