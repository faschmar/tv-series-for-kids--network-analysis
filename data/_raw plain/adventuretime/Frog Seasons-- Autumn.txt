{{L|[''A yellow [[Birds|bird]] flies over a field, and lands on [[Raggedy Princess]].'']}}
{{L|Raggedy Princess| Oh, hello bird. [''laughs''] Uh, I'm a scarecrow, see. But, I don't really want to scare you, so let me read you a poem instead. "Like a wilted flower, frail and bald. Rattled by the freezing autumn winds". [''the bird flies away''] Oh, I guess I'm very good at my job. But I do wish one of them would stay to hear the whole thing. [''the [[Frog Carrying Crown|frog]] begins walking by''] Hi, frog! Did you come to hear my poems? They're kinda long, so you have to walk slow. Or I could just read it fast! "Late last night through fevered dreams, I heard some faint and feeble screams. They'll only last to likely leave. Was crying out in gruesome grief".}}
{{L|[''[[Finn]] and [[Jake]] are seen following the frog.'']}}
{{L|Finn| We're still on his trail, Jake.}}
{{L|Raggedy Princess| Oh, hi Finn! Did you hear the poem?}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, Raggedy. We'd love to stay and chat, but we're kind of on a mission here. Maybe next time.}}
{{L|Raggedy Princess| No, you're right Finn. A true poet doesn't need an audience. [''the screen zooms in on the field, then moves up to the sky''] "I stand alone beneath the bleary sky..."}}
{{L|[''The screen pans down to Finn, Jake, and the frog in a muddy forest.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Shh, wait, he's gonna do it!}}
{{L|[''The frog lifts the crown above his head, but the wind blows it into Jake's hands. Finn and the frog gasp'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, don't put on-}}
{{L|Jake| Sorry, man.}}
{{L|[''Jake puts on the crown. the [[Mud Frogs]] emerge from the mud and bow down to Jake.'']}}
{{L|Jake| They love me! [''the mud frogs lift him up and carry him away''] Whoop, ha ha!}}
{{L|Finn|[''the frog jumps up and down angrily''] Oh no, you made the frog angry. He's hopping mad. [''laughs''] C'mon man, give it back. [''the frog starts crying'']}}
{{L|[''Finn walks over to Jake and the mud frogs. The frogs are still carrying jake, and they are also making a mud statue of him.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''annoyed''] C'mon man, give it back.}}
{{L|Jake| Nah, man, I like being the frog king. I'm gonna see where this leads, bro. [''the frogs carry him away'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''sighs, then looks toward the frog''].}}
{{L|[''The Tree Fort is shown on the outside. The screen then cuts inside where Finn is sitting on a bench, and [[BMO]] walks by. BMO gasps, and then the screen shows the frog sitting on the bench with Finn.'']}}
