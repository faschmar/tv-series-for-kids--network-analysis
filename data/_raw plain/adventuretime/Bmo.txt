{{L|[''The episode starts with beeping and whirring, as well as the inside views of [[BMO]].'']}}
{{L|[[BMO]]|Did you know there are more stars in the sky than there are grains of sand in the sky? It’s true. This is a rare asteroid made entirely of heavy metal. His name is Lars Darksaber. I don’t know any of these guys. Whoa! Look at that big boy go! That’s gonna be the biggest comet I ever did I – [''A [[Space Moth]] swallows the comet.''] What the heck? Let’s forget we saw this. Just another ineffable mystery in a universe of mysteries. [''Picks up a floating pick''] I wrote this song for my hat!}}
{{L|BMO|[''Singing''] ♪ Some people say that space is lonely: silent, empty, sparkling, and immense. But wide open spaces put smiles on cowboy faces, even when they’re stuck inside their tents. Yes, I’ve got my mission to distract me, from friendly folds I had to leave back home. And I’ve got my potatoes more exciting than tornadoes; potatoes, potatoes, buy my fresh potatoes! Terraforming Martian soil, just put ‘em in a pot to boil –}}
{{L|[''A sound of crack interrupts BMO singing. Soon, BMO’s spacecraft is pelted by raining meteoroids. BMO screams until the pelt stops.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Anybody get mashed?}}
{{L|[''BMO climbs back to the seat and finds out a crack nearby is propagating. It starts to suck air out.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Alert! Alert!}}
{{L|[''Some potatoes fly by and block the crack.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Time to make the doughnuts. [''Exits the spacecraft''] Boy, that meteoroid storm was scary. There probably won’t be scary cool things on Mars. It will just be me, alone.}}
{{L|[[Football]]|You’ll always have me, BMO.}}
{{L|BMO|Yes Football, but I meant new interesting people.}}
{{L|[''Football frowns.'']}}
{{L|BMO|[''Singing''] ♪ I've left my dream of grand adventure...}}

{{L|[''The object shapeshifts and waves.'']}}
{{L|BMO|You can stretch! Do you talk?}}
{{L|[''The object buzzes.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Hmm. Well, you're round and green, so I'm going to call you Olive. After my favorite type of bread. My name is BMO! [''Shakes hand with Olive.'']}}
{{L|[''Olive starts to scan BMO's body, which makes him giggles, and then Olive turns into an exclamation mark.'']}}
{{L|BMO|You like what you see, huh? You got the good taste.}}
{{L|[''Olive wraps the body over the spacecraft.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Huh? What are you doing?}}
{{L|[''Olive controls the spacecraft, which blasts in a hyper speed and passes by Mars.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Ah! That was Mars! We are going the wrong way! Olive! [''Screams; the spacetime is undergoing a strange warp''] So trippy!}}
{{L|[''The spacecraft reappears outside the atmosphere of an alien planet. BMO detects his surroundings.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Oh no no no! The stars are all jacked! Olive! You interfered with my mission!  [''Growls''] Okay I changed my mind! You can interfere, Olive! Please!}}
{{L|[''The spacecraft proceeds as the scene goes dark. Cut to a scene in the desert, where a machine is being observed by a humanoid rabbit, [[Y5|Y4]], who is recording her observation.'']}}
{{L|[[Y5|Y4]]|15 minutes have elapsed. Subject continues to struggle like a dum-dum. Its attempts are pitiful. But I am sworn not to interfere. [''Notified by some beeps of her device.'']}}
{{L|[[KS-2]]|[''Voice via the device''] Y4, report!}}
{{L|Y4|I found a weird bug bot on a rock.}}
{{L|KS-2|Ah, [[Hugo]]'s not gonna care about that. Don't come back until you find something useful.}}
{{L|Y4|Yes, ma'am. [''The call ended; sighs.'']}}
{{L|[''A group of Elf people run near Y4 and she decides to follow them. It turns out that a conflict between two species is about to happen.'']}}
{{L|Y4|[''Observing silently nearby, upside-down with her multi-functional boots''] This is great! New entry. Gray Elves and Shell People are squaring off over a newly excavated site. But which side will prevail? Do the less-dominant Shells fail to grasp the importance of the Elves' unity mission?}}
{{L|[[Cole]]|Elves! By the laws of [[the Drift]], we assert our claim to this very sweet photon transmogger.}}
{{L|[[Shafter]]|Heck, no, Cole. The transmogger belongs to [[Martin Mertens|Mr. M]]. I have the receipt. ''From you''. You sold it, man.}}
{{L|Cole|That never happened! And/or I don't remember doing it!}}
{{L|Shafter|WE need that part! I challenge you to a drift duel. One-on-one, Cole. Last man standing gets the transmogger, AKA me.}}
{{L|Cole|Oh, you think you're so tough with your lava blaster. But it's no match for my... [''Grunts as he making green bubbles over his back''] stink sacs!}}
{{L|Y4|Such a rare and majestic sight.}}
{{L|Shafter|Ew! No, thank you.}}
{{L|Cole|Ooh, stink you right up.}}
{{L|Shafter|On the count of five. One, two, thr... Now, [[Lenny Longlegs]]!}}
{{L|[''Lenny Longlegs runs swiftly to the photon transmogger.'']}}
{{L|Cole|Hey, you're cheating!}}
{{L|Y4|This is it!}}
{{L|[[Lenny Longlegs]]|Ha, ha! The Elves stand victorious ag...}}
{{L|[''BMO's spacecraft crashes in through the wall and destroys the photon transmogger in the process.'']}}
{{L|Cole|It's ruined!}}
{{L|Elves and Shells|No! No! No! No! Aaaaah! Aaaaah! Aaaaah! Aaaaah!}}
{{L|[''Two group grown in agony as BMO climbs out from the ruins, fake-crying as his left arm broken, catching their attention.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Phew! I thought that I was toast bread for sure. But I'm completely uninjured! Lucky I didn't crash into anything important.}}
{{L|[''The smoking transmogger shatters, shown by the two grunting species.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Ha! You weird babies. That's nothing to cry about. It's just garbage trash.}}
{{L|Shafter|Shelves! I... Ugh, I mean Elves and Shells, I propose a truce. Let us put aside our conflict.}}
{{L|BMO|Good babies.}}
{{L|Shafter|Let us join our forces, and together, united, destroy that little robot!}}
{{L|BMO|What?}}
{{L|Y4|Oh, no.}}
{{L|[''Elves and Shells shout and charge at BMO.'']}}
{{L|Elves and Shells|Get him! After the robot!}}
{{L|BMO|But I'm so cute.}}
{{L|[''BMO is taken away by Y4, who flees immediately.'']}}
{{L|Elves and Shells|Huh?}}
{{L|Shafter|Get them!}}
{{L|BMO|[''Laughs''] You're a rabbit!}}
{{L|Elves and Shells|Get him! Aaah!}}
{{L|[''Y4 runs for her lives with her boots as she is almost shot by lava blaster.'']}}
{{L|Y4|Aah!}}
{{L|BMO|They have terrible aim. Keep both eyes open!}}
{{L|Y4|Robot, what the heck? Cheese, I'm in trouble!}}
{{L|Cole|We'll go around! Hup! [''Throws a stink sac to Y4.'']}}
{{L|[''Y4 screams as she falls from a cliff but her boots' function saves her; she continues to run and feels nauseous about the smell at the same time.'']}}
{{L|Y4|Blah, why did I interfere? Oh, stupid, stupid, stupid!}}
{{L|[''BMO gets up inside Y4's backpack, seeing the creatures after them.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Tantrum babies.}}
{{L|[''Y4 runs through a crowded market as Elves destroy a statue next to the entry.'']}}
{{L|Y4|Aah! S-Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry! Don't hate me!}}
{{L|[''Y4 escapes through a hole in a structure, and Cole tries to catch up her.'']}}
{{L|Cole|Move over! [''stuck in the hole''] I'm stuck.}}
{{L|[''Shafter then goes to his superior instead, who is in a vehicle.'']}}
{{L|Shafter|[[Martin Mertens|Mr. M]]?}}
{{L|[[Martin Mertens|Mr. M]]|Well? Where's the transmogger?}}
{{L|Shafter|Some little bot came outta nowhere a-and trashed it. But we'll track him down, sir.}}
{{L|Mr. M|Forget him! Go back and see if you can salvage the pieces.}}
{{L|Shafter|Shouldn't we report this to Hugo?}}
{{L|Mr. M|Oh! No need to worry. I'll take care of that personally.}}
{{L|[''Y4 head to her place with BMO.'']}}
{{L|Y4|Field log, supplementary. After, uh, thoughtful consideration, I've scientifically decided to take the alien robot in for further study, scientifically.}}
{{L|[''BMO sees some flying [[Space Lards]] in the sky.'']}}
{{L|BMO|So beautiful! [''sees some malfunctioning droids, of Olive's kind, near them''] More Olives?}}
{{L|Y4|Finally!}}
{{L|BMO|Huh? Where are we?}}
{{L|Y4|My secret lab.  [''hovers and lands upside down on the rock above them.'']}}
{{L|BMO|A secret lab? [''gasps''] A secret lab! It's just how I've always pictured it, for the last two minutes.}}
{{L|Y4|There's gotta be an "off" switch somewhere.}}
{{L|BMO|Aah! Don't look at my bottom!}}
{{L|Y4|It can simulate embarrassment. Its maker must have been a weirdo.}}
{{L|BMO|I'm a self-made man. But who are you?}}
{{L|Y4|You can call me Y4, if you must.}}
{{L|BMO|No, that's boring. I will call you Harmonica.}}
{{L|Y4|I don't like that. It's funny, though. I have thought about calling myself something else.}}
{{L|BMO|Yeah, that's what I did. I called myself BMO, and the rest is history.}}
{{L|Y4|Really? 'Cause it looks like it's just printed on your side there.}}
{{L|BMO|Okay, thank you. Pick a name now.}}
{{L|Y4|Okay. Hypothetically, how about Wiiii... Five?}}
{{L|BMO|I love it!}}
{{L|[[Y5]]|Y5 will take care of that. I feel great about this new name. Begin science log. The alien robot entity's arm node seems to be attached by a galaxy standard bolt. There we go. Good as new.}}
{{L|BMO|Hello, BMO.}}
{{L|Y5|I guess I gotta knock you out now. For science.}}
{{L|[''Olive, outside Y5's lab, watching the process all along, zooms in the lab, slapping Y5's hand and try to protect BMO.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Oh. He's yours?}}
{{L|[''Olive nods.'']}}
{{L|BMO|BMO is his own big boy, thank you.}}
{{L|Y5|That old maintenance droid seems to think you're important.}}
{{L|BMO|Olive? She's a no-good-for-nothing troublemaker. Don't give me that puppy eye!}}
{{L|Y5|Serious? What's the worst a li'l robot can do?}}
{{L|[''The scene cuts to the place where the spacecraft crashed.'']}}
{{L|Shafter|You know, you guys don't really have to hang around.}}
{{L|Cole|Pssh! That dang robot has to come back to this ship eventually. Bob, do you have any threes?}}
{{L|Bob|Uh, go fish. [''the wall starts to shake and an air leak sucks the cards away.''] My winning hand!}}
{{L|Cole|I got a bad feeling.}}
{{L|[''BMO's spacecraft is pushed out by the air pressure; the air leak almost sucks Elves and Shells away, who grab on the ground, struggling. An alarm starts beeping.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Woop, woop, woop, woop! I hear that everywhere I go.}}
{{L|Y5|The atmosphere is getting sucked out of the breach! We need to vacate this pod!}}
{{L|BMO|No, I need my ship!}}
{{L|Y5|Your ship is long gone!}}
{{L|BMO|Lead the way, lady. [''They hear a scream.'']}}
{{L|Cole|[''o.s.''] I do not like this!}}
{{L|BMO|Come on, Y5! Toward the screaming!}}
{{L|Y5|But that's not what I do!}}
{{L|BMO|It's what I do - sometimes.}}
{{L|[''Olive joins BMO and turns into a hoverboard to carry him.'']}}
{{L|BMO|[''Gasps''] Hooray! I can't stay mad at you, magic skateboard. Come on, Y5!}}
{{L|[''Y5 eventually follow them, with her boots in the super-gravity mode.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Against all rational thought, the intrepid researcher returns to the breach to... Holy!}}
{{L|Shells and Elves|[''Screaming''] Help!}}
{{L|Cole|Ooh, look at those legs waggle!}}
{{L|BMO|[''To Shafter''] Gimme the blowtorch!}}
{{L|Shafter|No! Mine! Oh, no!}}
{{L|[''BMO and the elf both lose balance and start to drift with the air.'']}}
{{L|BMO and Shafter|Ahhh! Ahhh!}}
{{L|[''Y5 boosts her boot to save them, reaching BMO.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Oh!}}
{{L|Shafter|Hey, wait. [''sucked away into space'']}}
{{L|BMO|He died as he lived... sucking big time. Crab guy! Crab guy! You need to throw your shields all at once!}}
{{L|Cole|Uh, no. Why would I?}}
{{L|BMO|Because BMO has a mission.}}
{{L|Cole|Shells, throw your shields when the green box commands!}}
{{L|BMO|Now! [''shoots the lava blaster and seals the breach, which stop the leak.''] Easy like potato pie.}}
{{L|Y5|BMO, that was incredible. You single-handedly saved everyone!}}
{{L|[''The scene briefly cuts to Shafter in the space, unamused. Y5 sends a message away about BMO.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Olive. [''Olive turns into a loudspeaker.''] Okay. I know what you're all thinking. With my ship gone, I am trapped here. So, yes, I will save your terrible land. It does need saving, correct?}}
{{L|Cole|Yes.}}
{{L|BMO|Very well. Then I appoint myself your new sheriff. Now, show me where the trouble is!}}
{{L|Y5|Well, there's a lot of trouble in the drift. [''projects a map of The Drift.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Woof. Looks like I'm gonna need a deputy. [''Olive turns into a badge for Y5, making her heartwarming.''] I can't pay you.}}
{{L|[''Y5 checks her beeping messages, which is a reply: "Bring it in immediately. Maintain secrecy!!!"'']}}
{{L|Y5|BMO... you've just been summoned to... meet some very influential citizens.}}
{{L|BMO|That's great! It will give me a chance to check out my new stomping grounds.}}
{{L|Y5|Great!}}
{{L|[''Y5 and BMO walks together leaving the desert.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Back home, I'd only walk this far by accident.}}
{{L|Y5|What was the name of your home world again?}}
{{L|BMO|It is far from here. A little blue-and-green planet called BMO World.}}
{{L|Y5|... Never heard of it. Phew! Aah. I need to make a pit stop.}}
{{L|[''They come to a vending machine.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Oh, my goodness! Hello, big cousin!}}
{{L|Voice from the Machine|Welcome, driftgoer.}}
{{L|Y5|It's just a Hugomat. They're literally everywhere.}}
{{L|[''The Hugomat produces a bottle of drink instantly.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Cool!}}
{{L|Voice from the Machine|Your... sports energy drink is ready.}}
{{L|Y5|[''Drinks fast''] Whew!}}
{{L|BMO|Energy drinks. The future is amazing.}}
{{L|[''They enter a large building.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Golly. Did you make all of this?}}
{{L|Y5|No. I didn't personally build an ancient space station.}}
{{L|BMO|Whoa!}}
{{L|A Parrot Vendor|Buy my eggs! Buy my eggs! Or I swear to glob I'll eat them myself!}}
{{L|BMO|Hey, check out this hothouse mess.}}
{{L|Y5|Nobody goes into Jungle Pod. The life forms have all mutated into strange and dangerous things. Come on.}}
{{L|BMO|I will play with you, strange things.}}
{{L|[''They walk past through a Hugomat, where two bugs are entering.'']}}
{{L|[[Darling]]|Dude, climb with your legs, not your arms.}}
{{L|[[Sweetie]]|I'm getting tired!}}
{{L|Darling|We're almost there, Sweetie! Come on!}}
{{L|BMO|What are you up to?}}
{{L|Darling|Uh, well, hello, there, Sheriff BMO. My brother and I are just, uh, climbing up to the coin slot of this Hugomat for some, uh, exercise.}}
{{L|Sweetie|We love fitness!}}
{{L|BMO|You two sound like some fishy four flushers. I've got my eye on you... fishies!}}
{{L|Darling|I'm so scared.}}
{{L|[''Y5 and BMO arrives in a space grazing land; one of the farmers is tooting.'']}}
{{L|BMO|What's wrong, partner?}}
{{L|Farmer|Hey, you're that new guy who's all over the inter-pod streams.}}
{{L|BMO|Yes, I'm famous. Now tell us why you're crying, ugly man.}}
{{L|Farmer|Well, it's one of my baby space lards. It won't come back in from stargrazin'. Which is what I call grazin'.}}
{{L|[''The said space lard is flying in turns, outside the shield.'']}}
{{L|BMO|They look so cold and scared! BMO lasso!}}
{{L|[''BMO uses Olive as a lasso and pulls back the space lard to the farmer.'']}}
{{L|Farmer|Man, I don't know what I would have done if this tender little baby had frozen... [''with a ferocious face''] before I could eat it.}}
{{L|BMO|What?! You want in on this? I make my own sauce. In my sauce gland.}}
{{L|BMO|No! I saved this lard. You will repay me by caring for him and keeping him safe forever. Also, his name is Ricky!}}
{{L|Farmer|Yaa! Yes, sir.}}
{{L|BMO|Gimme that! [''takes away the toot'']}}
{{L|Y5|This robot expends energy in ways that yield it no benefit. So weird.}}
{{L|BMO|Deputy, carry this. I don't have pockets.}}
{{L|[''They continue moving. On their way, the ground starts to shake; the gravity suddenly reverses and everyone screams as they're thrown up.'']}}
{{L|Y5|It's another gravity outage!}}
{{L|[''Y5 changes the mode of her boots and she's horizontally thrown to a wasteland; screaming until she lands.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Blooey.}}
{{L|BMO|This station is trash. I've got my work cut out for me.}}
{{L|Y5|Don't worry. Hugo's got a plan to fix things.}}
{{L|BMO|Who's Hugo?}}
{{L|[[CGO]]|[''Singing''] "♪ Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-callin' tossed salads and scrambled eggs. ♪" Oh, my. "♪ And maybe I seem a bit confused... ♪" }}
{{L|BMO|I think I know this song.}}
{{L|CGO|[''cont'd''] ♪ But I got you pegged... ♪ }}
{{L|Y5|Forget about that old robot. We've got a mission, remember?}}
{{L|CGO|[''cont'd''] Good night, Seattle! We love you!}}
{{L|Y5|01110000, 01100001, 01110011, 01110011, 01110111, 01101111, 01110010, 01100100.}}
{{L|[''A transporter appears from the ground before Y5 and they get in.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Who are we going to see again? I forgot. [''sees the underground world outside, gasps''] Bunnies! So many bunnies! Haha, this one runs a hotel!}}
{{L|Y5's Dad|[''Behind the door''] ... if he's impressed with it, our place on the Unity Pod is a lock.}}
{{L|KS-2|If Y4's data isn't flawed... Which, you know...}}
{{L|Y5|Um, I'm back. Mom? Dad? Come look what I found.}}
{{L|Y5's Dad|Oh, my brain! A functioning service droid! I haven't seen one of these in forever.}}
{{L|Y5|Mom, let me introduce you to...}}
{{L|BMO|Howdy, Mom! Nice to meet...}}
{{L|[''KS-2 opens BMO straight and pushes the off button. Olive pokes inactive BMO.'']}}
{{L|KS-2|There's bound to be useful U-Pod parts in here.}}
{{L|Y5's Dad|We should call Mr. M!}}
{{L|Y5|I did good, right? These are some great... parts.}}
{{L|[''The ground shakes again, with alarm.'']}}
{{L|KS-2|Another failure?}}
{{L|Y5's Dad|It's in Communications Pod!}}
{{L|KS-2|There's never been one this close before!}}
{{L|Y5's Dad|What do we do?}}
{{L|Y5|BMO likes alarms.}}
{{L|KS-2|Y4, hush! The adults are talking.}}
{{L|[''Olive reactivates BMO.'']}}
{{L|BMO|... Eet you! Huh?}}
{{L|Y5|BMO! There's a pod in danger.}}
{{L|BMO|Let's ride! [''runs upstairs, humming'']}}
{{L|KS-2|Y4! What about Mr. M?}}
{{L|Y5|Don't worry. I'll watch over the, uh, parts.}}
{{L|[''Y5 and BMO run to the Communication Pod, where things are collapsing and flooding. Sweetie and his brother are still stealing things from a Hugomat.'']}}
{{L|Darling|Come on, keep printing stuff we can heist this thing with.}}
{{L|Y5|We gotta bail!}}
{{L|BMO|Wait! It's our duty to evacuate the citizens. I will save you, weird duck!}}
{{L|Duck|I'm fine!}}
{{L|[''BMO jumps into the water, causing a short circuit.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Aah! Robots can't go in the water!}}
{{L|BMO|Fine! You are my arms and legs. Now help me get everyone to safety!}}
{{L|A Feet Creature|Excuse me. We're too small and stupid to save ourselves.}}
{{L|BMO|Don't worry, Bumbos.}}
{{L|[''A device falls and crashes behind them.'']}}
{{L|Feet Creatures|Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.}}
{{L|BMO|Shush! Hey, use your big brain and think of another way out of here.}}
{{L|Y5|Um... Oh! There's another hatch over this way.}}
{{L|Feet Creatures|Hop, hop, hop, hop. Hop, hop, hop, hop. Hop, hop, hop, hop.}}
{{L|Y5|Through here.}}
{{L|Feet Creatures|Hop, hop, hop, hop.}}
{{L|A Feet Creature|Wait, I think I forgot something. Can I go back?}}
{{L|BMO|Get out!}}
{{L|A Feet Creature|Okay.}}
{{L|Sweetie and Darling|Sheriff! We messed up! Aaaaah!}}
{{L|[''Sweetie and Darling are trapped in the Hugomat and are flushing away.'']}}
{{L|BMO|You can swim, right?}}
{{L|Y5|Yes, but badly.}}
{{L|BMO|Giddy up! [''stomps her'']}}
{{L|Y5|Ow! [''KS-2 is calling.''] H-Hello?}}
{{L|KS-2|Y4! Where are you?! Mr. M is on his way to pick up that unit for dismemberment.}}
{{L|Y5|Heading back now! Aaaah!}}
{{L|KS-2|What's going on?}}
{{L|[''A tide almost flushes them away, while the crack on the ceiling propagates allowing more water flooding in.'']}}

{{L|BMO|Y5, chew through the glass with your big, nasty teeth. [''Olive turns into an ax.''] Huh? Yay, Olive! Swing! Swing now!}}
{{L|Y5|Hup! [''cuts the Hugomat open with Olive.'']}}
{{L|Darling|Geez, careful much? You almost smashed our loot.}}
{{L|Sweetie|Yeah, watch it next time.}}
{{L|Darling|Can't this rabbit swim any faster?}}
{{L|Sweetie|On it. [''lights one of the fireworks in their loots.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Did you just light a firework on my - [''screams; they boost just fast enough before a pod gate closes.'']}}
{{L|BMO|I told you we would make it. You sure are a worried wart, Olive.}}
{{L|Sweetie|Hey, Flatfoot, we found this thing inside the Hugomat. We don't know what it does. So, it's yours. [''throws a flash drive to BMO, who plugs it in his socket.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Ooh, that's smooth data.}}
{{L|[''BMO unplugs the drive and crushes it under his foot.'']}}
{{L|Y5|I can't believe I did that.}}
{{L|BMO|How did it feel?}}
{{L|Y5|Kinda... good, actually.}}
{{L|BMO|Of course! You're my deputy, after all!}}
{{L|Y5|Oh! R-Right. Listen, BMO.}}
{{L|BMO|Yes, my true friend?}}
{{L|Y5|Uh, BMO, there's something I need to tell you.}}
{{L|[''Mr. M's vehicle stops next to them.'']}}
{{L|Mr. M|Get in the car.}}
{{L|BMO|We should accept this ride from a stranger.}}
{{L|[''There's an awkward silence as BMO, Y5, and Olive are face to face in front of Mr. M in the car.'']}}
{{L|BMO|This is a pretty sick ride, I gotta say.}}
{{L|[''Mr. M's car drives fast and while and it almost hits a citizen on the way.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Is that...?}}
{{L|Mr. M|That's the answer to all the Drift's problems! Behold! The Unity Pod!}}
{{L|BMO|Oh, I thought it was a popcorn maker.}}
{{L|Mr. M|Hugo's whippin' up some pretty sweet gadgets in there, the raddest stuff your little bot eyes will ever see.}}
{{L|BMO|Oh, boy.}}
{{L|Y5|[''Talks to herself''] So what if Hugo takes BMO apart? It... It's for the greater good, right? And I am all about the greater good. Greater good!}}
{{L|[''They enter Hugo's headquarters.'']}}
{{L|Y5|So many Hugomats.}}
{{L|Mr. M|Yep, yep. I actually came up with those myself. Isn't that right, boss?}}
{{L|[[Hugo]]|Huh? Uh, yes. Ha, uh, the Hugomats were Mr. M's idea.}}
{{L|Y5|Hugo.}}
{{L|Hugo|That boy loves flashy gadgets. Me? I'm more of a pragmatist. You must be KS-2's daughter. Nice to meet you.}}
{{L|Y5|Uh, you, too, also.}}
{{L|Hugo|Is this the spicy tech I heard about?}}
{{L|BMO|You are so gray, and bald.}}
{{L|Hugo|Ha! Yeah, I am. [''notices Olive''] Oh! Uh... Noice!}}
{{L|Y5|Buh...}}
{{L|Hugo|Mr. M, why don't you entertain our guests for a bit?}}
{{L|Mr. M|You're a kid. Kids love dumb games, right?}}
{{L|Y5|Um...}}
{{L|Mr. M|Great!}}
{{L|[''Y5 looks at BMO, who is humming, waiting for Hugo.'']}}
{{L|Y5|The greater good.}}
{{L|Mr. M|What do you say we spice things up a bit? If I win, I get those fancy grav boots.}}
{{L|Y5|What? No way.}}
{{L|Mr. M|Oh, come on. If I lose, you get my fancy boots.}}
{{L|Y5|Ugh. [''gasps as she sees Hugo is "drilling" BMO.'']}}
{{L|Hugo|Dang, this robot is one-of-a-kind. But nothing here I can use.}}
{{L|[''Y5 sighs in relief.'']}}
{{L|Hugo|Bummer. Well, maybe next time, KS-2's daughter.}}
{{L|BMO|Not so fast! The sheriff is here to help. Tell me what you need.}}
{{L|Hugo|Okay... We've located the final component for the Unity Pod... the Genesis Crystal. Unfortunately, it lies within the impenetrable Jungle Pod. And all our attempts to grab it have been hot garbo. So, we're engineering our own. How's it going, guys?}}
{{L|One of the Engineers|I think we've finally cracked it, sir. Permission to run a test? [''Hugo whistles.''] Cool, cool. Commencing test 325.}}
{{L|[''A synthetic crystal is being tested but it soon explodes.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Huh? [''distracted; accidentally pressing one of her cards''] That... That shouldn't count!}}
{{L|Mr. M|Tough beans, kid. A deal's a deal.}}
{{L|Y5|No!}}
{{L|One of the Engineers|Sorry, Hugo. Please don't be mad.}}
{{L|BMO|You are not a very good scientist!}}
{{L|Hugo|Oh. Reset for test 326.}}
{{L|BMO|No, I will get you the real junk.}}
{{L|Hugo|What? Oh... Really?}}
{{L|BMO|I'm your Huckleberry.}}
{{L|Mr. M|Now, I gotta agree with the little bot, boss. He's quick, plants won't eat him...}}
{{L|BMO|That's right. Plants hate me!}}
{{L|Hugo|I'm smelling what you're baking. Smells good. You know what? Let's try it. What the heck?}}
{{L|Y5|Um, is that...}}
{{L|BMO|Saddle up, deputy! We are going to find some treasure!}}
{{L|Y5|Are you really sure about this?}}
{{L|BMO|I believe in us.}}
{{L|Mr. M|I'll meet you out front.}}
{{L|[''As Y5 leaves with BMO, she meets her mother as the door opens.'']}}
{{L|Y5 and KS-2|Aah!}}
{{L|Y5|Mom, uh, what, uh...}}
{{L|KS-2|There was some kind of accident at the crystal lab. Apparently the new prototype exploded... again.}}
{{L|BMO|Oh, Mom. Don't worry about that fake. The BMO is headed to the Jungle Pod right now to fetch the real one.}}
{{L|KS-2|Why isn't BMO in a million pieces?!}}
{{L|Y5|Uh, Hugo didn't need him?}}
{{L|KS-2|Fantastic! So we're back at square one.}}
{{L|BMO|Lady, stop talking. Come on, sidekick deputy!}}
{{L|KS-2|What?! You're following that little toy's orders?!}}
{{L|Y5|No! I'm just following Hugo's orders!}}
{{L|KS-2|Y4! Tell me the truth!}}
{{L|Y5|... I'm sorry, Mom. I-I was just humoring it at first. So we could get to Hugo, no fuss. But I got carried away. I know I'm not some "deputy," alright? It was just a dumb game.}}
{{L|Mr. M|You two comin' or what?}}
{{L|BMO|Yeah. I am. Because I'm the only one around here that doesn't bite.}}
{{L|[''Olive flies in front of BMO, blocking him.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Aah! Stop it, Bad Olive!}}
{{L|Y5|Olive! Let him go.}}
{{L|BMO|I don't need your help.}}
{{L|Y5|BMO, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings!}}
{{L|BMO|I have no feelings!}}
{{L|Mr. M|Forget about her, champ. Big, cool guys like us don't need nobody else.}}
{{L|BMO|You make my feelings happy!}}
{{L|KS-2|Y4! Come on!}}
{{L|Y5|Yes, ma'am.}}
{{L|[''Mr. M brings BMO to the Jungle Pod.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Yep, this doesn't feel dangerous at all. Aren't you coming?}}
{{L|Mr. M|Oh, uh, no. It's real easy to get lost in J-Pod. So I'll be guiding you with this map.}}
{{L|BMO|Oh. But couldn't we bring the map?}}
{{L|Mr. M|Think fast. [''throws a walkie-talkie''] We'll stay in touch through that walkie-talkie. You'll only be alone in the, uh, literal sense.}}
{{L|BMO|BMO is never alone. Right, Football?}}
{{L|Football|Please, don't bring me in there, BMO.}}
{{L|Mr. M|[''Via the walkie-talkie''] Keep walking straight for 1,400 frames.}}
{{L|BMO|Copy that. 1,002, 1,003, 1,004. }}
{{L|Football|I don't like this place, BMO.}}
{{L|BMO|You are a delicate soul, Football. But BMO will not be intimidated by nature! [''A mutated creature briefly stops on BMO.''] Aah! Ah, so pretty.}}
{{L|Football|BMO, I'm scared.}}
{{L|BMO|Oh, Football. I know you're a scaredy cat, but I have to complete my mission.}}
{{L|Football|BMO, I think maybe you're also scared of this mission.}}
{{L|BMO|No.}}
{{L|Football|BMO, if you bonk this up and die, I couldn't live with myself.}}
{{L|BMO|Oh, Football, I won't bonk up.}}
{{L|[''A creature with white tentacles seizes BMO's foot.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Aah! Whack! Whack! Aaaaaah! [''flees'']}}
{{L|[''BMO falls into a hole as the creature chases above.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Lucky this hole was here. Oh.}}
{{L|Football|Not lucky, BMO. You are in the dirt hole now. Dirt hole!}}
{{L|BMO|Aaaaah! Run, BMO!}}
{{L|[''The hole starts to emit green substances, which briefly erodes one of BMO's hands.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Aah!}}
{{L|[''The crab creatures in the hole gather together, and they tap their claws.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Ew!}}
{{L|[''As the tap continues, a wing is formed in the claw and the creatures fly away. There is still one left that still can't activate its wings.'']}}
{{L|BMO|You are my gross ticket out of here! Crusty piece of crab! [''BMO helps it to open the wings.''] Fly, donkus! Yay! You are my new best friend, Crusty!}}
{{L|[''As they fly, Crusty is eaten and BMO falls from the air.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Crusty!}}
{{L|Mr. M|[''Via the walkie-talkie''] BMO? BMO!}}
{{L|BMO|That was a close call, Mr. M. Mother Drift got a taste of BMO, but I licked her right back.}}
{{L|Mr. M|Whose mother?}}
{{L|[''Y5 is with her mother, who is fixing the prototype with others.'']}}
{{L|KS-2|Y4! Could you bring me a J-clamp from out by the... Where are your gravity boots?}}
{{L|Y5|I was playing cards with...}}
{{L|KS-2|You gambled?!}}
{{L|Y5|What?! No! The... It was Mr...}}
{{L|KS-2|Honestly, Y4! We'll talk about this later.}}
{{L|[''Y5 goes to find her boots and she found them in the storage room of Mr. M's.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Ha! Wait. That's another Hugomat stick. I wonder what's on these. [''Olive forms a drive socket.''] Wow. Okay. I didn't know you could do that. [''Olive projects the data in the drive.''] Whoa! What the h...}}
{{L|[''The scene cuts to Mr. M and BMO.'']}}
{{L|Mr. M|Hey, good job, li'l guy! You'll be on top of the crystal in a mm-bop!}}
{{L|BMO|It's...  mad indignant.}}
{{L|Y5|All of the Hugomats are networked. Mr. M has them identifying useful components in each pod without anyone knowing. That's so unethical. I hope BMO is okay.}}
{{L|Football|I don't feel good about this, BMO.}}
{{L|BMO|I'm going to take this crystal, Football. I'm going to be a hero. I don't need a deputy! I don't need anybody!}}
{{L|[''As soon as the crystal is unplugged by BMO, all the creatures in the jungle start to shriek, struggle, and they wither away very fast. BMO flees.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!}}
{{L|Y5|Look, Olive. The Genesis Crystal is moving. BMO did it!}}
{{L|[''A message of the projection reveals that the Jungle Pod fails.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Wait. Wait, wait, wait! All of the failed pods are missing components. By taking them, Mr. M is killing the Drift. We have to warn Hugo!}}
{{L|[''BMO screams as he runs for his life.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Blood! Blood-erflies! Mr. M! I got the crystal!}}
{{L|Mr. M|Throw it here so you can run faster! [''BMO does so.''] Yes!}}
{{L|BMO|Now catch me! [''jumps'']}}
{{L|[''Mr. M shuts down the gate, with only BMO's right arm stuck outside, flapping.'']}}
{{L|Mr. M|Oh. [''whistles''] Very unfortunate.}}
{{L|Football|Oh, BMO, you tried, but you were never the hero of the story I like to call life. You were always just the cute sidekick.}}
{{L|BMO|Football!}}
{{L|Football|Oh, no, don't cry, BMO.}}
{{L|BMO|You know I'm an empath.}}
{{L|[''A creature reaches BMO and tries to pull him away.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Huh?! No! No! Football! Help!}}
{{L|Football|BMO!}}
{{L|[''BMO is ripped into pieces. Cuts to his subconsciousness.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Oh. This is probably bad, huh? I think I'm dying. But that's okay. BMO always bounces back.}}
{{L|Purple BMO|Mnh-mnh. Not this time.}}
{{L|BMO|But I'm supposed to save the Drift. That's my job.}}
{{L|Red BMO|Now your job is to be dead.}}
{{L|BMO|Oh, no.}}
{{L|Blue BMO|BMO, you can get through this.}}
{{L|BMO|Really?}}
{{L|Green BMO|Just kidding.}}
{{L|Yellow BMO|You're not a hero.}}
{{L|All colorful BMOs|You're nothing but a little kid, BMO.}}
{{L|BMO|Oh. No. BMO always bounces ba...}}
{{L|[''The scene cuts to BMO's parts scattered on the ground.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Hugo! Hugo, Hugo, Hugo! I never had to do this much exercise before I ran into BMO... Aah! [''runs into KS-2'']}}
{{L|KS-2|I've been waiting for those J-clamps.}}
{{L|Y5|Mom, look what I grabbed from Mr. M's office! He's behind all of it... The Drift collapse, the pod failures. He's a no-good, rootin'-tootin' four flusher!}}
{{L|KS-2|I don't know if those are swear words, but that sassy robot has messed you up. [''Takes away the drive.'']}}
{{L|Mr. M|What's up, bunnies? Hopefully nothing... slanderous.}}
{{L|KS-2|I am so sorry, sir. [''Give the drive to Mr. M.'']}}
{{L|Mr. M|No harm done. [''Hides the drive under his suit.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Ha! I've already got all the proof backed up right here! [''Takes Olive, but nothing happens.'']}}
{{L|Mr. M|Woof.}}
{{L|[''KS-2 deactivates Olive.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Mom! Where's BMO?}}
{{L|Mr. M|Uhp, uhp, uhp. The good news is that he got the Genesis Crystal. The even better news is that li'l BMO died a hero.}}
{{L|KS-2 and her husband|Hurrah!}}
{{L|Y5|No! I have to save him!}}
{{L|KS-2|No, Y4!}}
{{L|Y5|My name is Y5. BMO is my friend. And I let him down because I didn't want to disappoint you. [''runs away'']}}
{{L|KS-2|Y4!}}
{{L|Mr. M|Ha. Kids, right? Always calling out their deadbeat parents.}}
{{L|KS-2|What?}}
{{L|Mr. M|What?}}
{{L|Y5|I can't do this alone. Olive's gone. It's too far to the Jungle Pod. I'm too slow. Huh [''She finds the lard toot, which she blows and summons Ricky instantly.''] Ricky! Aah! [''Ricky cuddles Y5.''] Stop. Stop. He's not here. Listen, BMO's in trouble.}}
{{L|[''Ricky flies fast with Y5 to the gate of Jungle Pod.'']}}
{{L|Y5|BMO! I'll get you... o-o-o-o-ut! [''pulls BMO's arm out''] Aah! [''notices BMO's parts next to them; screams with Ricky''] Aah! Stop!}}
{{L|Darling|Stop! Hey, back off! We had to squeeze all these parts out of a sealed pod.}}
{{L|Y5|That's my friend!}}
{{L|Darling|I'll sell you the parts.}}
{{L|Sweetie|Ain't this the bunny that what, like, saved us?}}
{{L|Y5|Please! The Drift is in danger, and BMO's the only one people will listen to!}}
{{L|Darling|Ohh, my conscience gland.}}
{{L|Sweetie|We may know somebody who can help.}}
{{L|[''Ricky brings them to the wasteland.'']}}
{{L|Darling|Ha!}}
{{L|Sweetie|Yo, CGO. You up?}}
{{L|Y5|CGO?}}
{{L|CGO|I smell that goody scrap. I call dibs.}}
{{L|Darling|Make us an offer.}}
{{L|Y5|What? Cut it out! I-I mean, ma'am, these two said you could patch up the sheriff.}}
{{L|CGO|Hmm. This is a [[MO Co.]] Bot.}}
{{L|Y5|You know this model?}}
{{L|CGO|I'm practically a cousin, a janky off-brand cousin.}}
{{L|Sweetie|Yeah, but can you do it, though?}}
{{L|CGO|Hmm... probs.}}
{{L|Y5|Whoo-hoo! With BMO's cred, we can convince Hugo to stop Mr. M's schemes.}}
{{L|CGO|Hugo? I don't know what you've heard, but Hugo is the worst.}}
{{L|Y5|What do you know?}}
{{L|CGO|Uh, duh. He created me. We go way back, to the real busted last days of Earth. [''flashbacks''] Hugo had a big brain and a rocket and led an exodus to the stars on the cheap. The Grays warned him about the dangers of bio-hacking their alien style, but Hugo gets his way. Then we were saved by a orb. The Drift was already breaking down when we got here. But after Hugo set up shop, well, he just makes everything worse. I got chucked into the trash. That little service droid went back into space. Poor thing. I wonder if she ever found what she was looking for. [''Flashback ends.'']  Hugo's a great guy... as long as he thinks you're good for something.}}
{{L|[''On hearing this, Y5 squats back and sheds tears silently.'']}}
{{L|CGO|Hey, quit leaking on my scrap. Fingers crossed. [''presses BMO's button''] Maybe he needs to warm up a bit.}}
{{L|[''KS-2 puts the Genesis Crystal on the brackets extended from the Unity Pod; with the engineers' help, the Unity Pod initializes priming sequence. At the same time, The Drift starts to fail.'']}}
{{L|Darling|Whoop. Was that me?}}
{{L|Y5|Ow! BMO, you have to wake up! I can't fix this! I'm just a little kid!}}
{{L|BMO|I said the same thing when I was dying. You saved me. You can save the Drift.}}
{{L|Y5|But it's just too much.}}
{{L|BMO|Even when things look really, really stupid, we still have to try.}}
{{L|Cole|Our suns all went out.}}
{{L|One of the farmers|That's nothing. All our crops are dying. It's gross.}}
{{L|Y5's Dad|Oof! Pod fails. They're spreading everywhere.}}
{{L|KS-2|Y4 was right!}}
{{L|Y5's Dad|I've never heard you say those words.}}
{{L|KS-2|Hugo! You have to shut down the priming sequence! We're on the verge of station-wide collapse!}}
{{L|Hugo|Uh, this is exactly the kind of problem the Unity Pod team will be working to prevent. Hugocorp Gold Members, come on up here.}}
{{L|[''Y5 and her friends, screaming, arrives to the plaza with the help by Ricky.'']}}
{{L|Y5|Ohh! Everyone, wait!  Hugo's up to no good! There's proof in this Hugomat!}}
{{L|BMO|Oh! Are you trying to get another drive?}}
{{L|Y5|Do you still have the data?}}
{{L|BMO|That smooth, smooth data. Right here. [''projects the data to the Unity Pod; everyone gasps'']}}
{{L|Y5|You're donking it all up, Hugo! Do you deny it?}}
{{L|Hugo|Nah, it's all true. The Unity Pod was always designed to save only myself and my loyal inner circle. The rest of the Drift is... Well, it's unfortunate collateral damage in the grand scheme of things. Besides, this all can't be on me. Y'all thought the Unity Pod sounded like a sweet deal, as long as you thought you were getting a piece of the pie. But if anyone was offended by my actions, I am truly, truly... [''presses the button and destroys the control panel with a rod, running into the Unity Pod, which activates..'']}}
{{L|Mr. M|Well, time for me to get the heck out of here. [''flies to the surface of the Unity Pod with a rocket pack''] Wuh-oh!}}
{{L|Y5's Dad|There's no way to stop the activation process.}}
{{L|KS-2|The station's power will be sucked dry!}}
{{L|Y5|No! We were so close!}}
{{L|BMO|Why don't we just pull the plug? If we remove the plug before it's powered up, it won't turn on.}}
{{L|KS-2|The robot is right. The only way we can stop the U-Pod from draining all the juice from the Drift is to eject it.}}
{{L|BMO|Yes! Brute force!}}
{{L|KS-2|Everyone, we're going to need a lot of muscle.}}
{{L|One of the farmers|I got muscle. Lard muscle. Go on! Put yer bumps into it!}}
{{L|Cole|Swing those shields, Shells!}}
{{L|BMO|Use your handsome bodies! Go, go, go! Ice that pod!}}
{{L|All Drift citizens|Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!}}
{{L|[''The space lards, with their forces, destroys the scaffolding of the Unity Pods and eject the pod outside the Drift; Mr. M fails to catch up with the pod.'']}}

{{L|Y5|Ahhhhh! We did it! Oh!}}
{{L|BMO|No, we did it!}}
{{L|[''Everyone cheers.'']}}
{{L|KS-2|Hold up, everyone! I don't want to be a downer, but we just launched all of our best resources into space.}}
{{L|One of the citizens|[''People talk to each other unsettled''] Is it too late to get on the U-Pod?}}
{{L|Y5|It's true. Most of the station is dead now, and all communications are down. We're going to have to manage the remaining resources to survive. We need to learn how to help each other. I know it's hard, but we have to try, or we won't make it.}}
{{L|Sweetie|I'll give it a shot.}}
{{L|Darling|Yeah. We can teach y'all how to steal and, uh...}}
{{L|Sweetie|Forage for spare parts in the defunct pods.}}
{{L|One of the citizens|We'll rebuild Hugo's old lab. Maybe we can find some non-apocalyptic energy.}}
{{L|Y5's Dad|Y5? Can you forgive us? We were so focused on getting our family to a better place that we lost our way.}}
{{L|KS-2|You're an amazing person, Y5.}}
{{L|BMO|Yep, it's time for this sheriff to move on. Ricky, let's ride! Yee-haw!}}

{{L|[''Olive reactivates and goes out from a bag.'']}}
{{L|Hugo|Oh, it's you. Still disappointed in me? [''Olive cuddles him.''] Ha!}}
{{L|BMO|... And I grabbed as many snacks as I wanted. The end. I should tell that story to Y5 next time I see her. I bet she will be mayor by then.}}
