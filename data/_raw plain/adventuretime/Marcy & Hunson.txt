{{L|[[Peppermint Butler]]|Swordsmith Deity, from your unseen throne, bless this sword with your mighty hone! This new sword is guaranteed to defend you against Princess Bubblegum's heinous family. Uncle Gumbald!}}
{{L|[''CLANK'']}} 
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Aunt Lolly!}} 
{{L|[''CLANK'']}} 
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Cousin Chicle!}} 
{{L|[''CLANK'']}} 
{{L|[[Jake]]|I like your swordsmith hat.}}
{{L|I'm wearing it in honor of my special guest.}}
{{L|Jake|Am I your special guest?}} 
{{L|Peppermint Butler|No.}}
{{L|Jake|Dang.}}
{{L|[''The sword sizzles as peppermint butler dips it into a bucket of water'']}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|This sword will serve you much better than your old, cursed Grass Sword. This sword is also cursed, but it has a compass in the hilt!}} 
{{L|Finn|Neat!}} 
{{L|And now for one more thing; The special guest I now will bring!}} 
{{L|[''Peppermint Butler smashes a container of [[bug milk]] over a drawing of a [[phil fac]]'']}} 
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum!}} 
{{L|[''[[Hunson Abadeer]] emerges from the newly formed flames'']}} 
{{L|Finn and Jake|[''gasps'']}}
{{L|Finn|Hunson Abadeer!}}
{{L|Hunson|Finn the Human! And Jake the Dog! Hey, did Marceline call me-?}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|It is I who summoned you. I humbly ask you for an infusion of [[Nightosphere]] magic upon this sword.}} 
{{L|Hunson|Okay.}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|I proclaim this blade [''Ow! Ow!''] "The [[Night Sword]]"! Now to send you back.}}
{{L|Hunson|Not so fast. It's like I got a free flight here. I'm gonna go see my little girl.}}
{{L|Finn|Back in the hole, [[Marceline]]'s dad.}}
{{L|Hunson|I'll behave myself. No soul sucking, no evil stuff. I'm trying to be a better person. Maybe it's too late for me, but I'm trying. Oh, I'm so ashamed of the things I've done! [''crying'']}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Have some dignity, man! All right. You may leave the circle for one day.}}
{{L|Hunson|Wheeeeee! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Time to suck some souls! [''sucking'']}}
{{L|[''Peppermint Butler uses the Night Sword to enchant handcuffs on Hunson.'']}} 
{{L|Hunson|Hey, what gives?}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Phantom manacles your wrists shall constrain until you're back in your hole again! Finn.}}
{{L|Finn|Let's go see Marcy.}}
{{L|Jake|Great sword making, Pep But.}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Yo, see you guys at the concert!}} 
{{L|Hunson| [''singing''] Walkin' in ooo, not suckin' out souls Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck.}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, could you stop saying that, please?}} 
{{L|Hunson|So what's my little monster up to these days? Is she still all goody-goody? Still half-vampire? Started dating anyone?}} 
{{L|Finn|Yes, yes, but no, then yes again, and maybe? Look, maybe cool it with the prying around Marceline.}}
{{L|Hunson|Nah, she loves it when I pry.}}
{{L|[[Crunchy|Chicle]]|[''chuckles''] Oh, Chicle, have you finally discovered the vampire girl's weakness? I think sooo.[''chuckles''] Chuckling mode off.}}
{{L|Hunson|[''whistling "SHAVE AND A HAIRCUT"''] You know, now that we're here, I'm having second thoughts. It just seems like no matter what I do, I always tick that girl off.}}
{{L|[''flashback'']}}
{{L|Hunson|[''crashes through Marceline's newly-made bunker''] Marceline! Long time no see. Some [[Ice King|googoo with glasses]] summoned me. What's [[Hambo|that thing]]? Just gonna put [[Ax Bass|this]] here, okay? Now let's go suck some souls!}} 
{{L|Hunson|[''present day''] I don't know what it is.}}
{{L|Jake|[''Finn and Jake drawing a PHIL face to send Hunson back to the Nightosphere''] Uhh, heh.}}
{{L|Finn|[''clears throat''] Psst-psst [''points to Marceline, who is staring at Hunson through the window''].}}
{{L|Marceline|Dad, what are you doing here?}} 
{{L|Hunson|I'm in town for the week, and I don't really have a place to stay, dot, dot, dot.}}
{{L|Marceline|Mnh. How many souls did he suck on his way here?}} 
{{L|Finn|Oh, I guess like zero. But-}} 
{{L|Hunson|See! I made Finn a cool, new sword and everything!}} 
{{L|Marceline|I guess you can crash here.}}
{{L|Great! Thanks for inviting me.}}
{{L|Marceline|That is not what's happening.}}
{{L|Finn|We're gonna jet, Marcy.}}
{{L|Hunson|What?! You just got here. Invite them in, Marceline.}}
{{L|[''Marceline waves them inside'']}}
{{L|Hunson|Do you have a bathroom?}} 
{{L|Marceline|Yeah, there's one upstairs.}}
{{L|Hunson|I just have to freshen up.}}
{{L|Marceline|Is my dad really behaving himself this time?}} 
{{L|Finn|He's just been singing songs and stuff.}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, he seems pretty fun for an old guy. Hey, wait a minute... I'm an old guy!}} 
{{L|Hunson|Hey, excuse my unsociableness. There's just one thing; The Venetian blinds in your bathroom kind of jumped out at me and got broken.}}
{{L|Marceline|How could you wreck the blinds just by going to the bathroom?}} 
{{L|Hunson|Let me make it up to you. I've got some soy sauce and some ketchup.}}
{{L|Marceline|I'm good.}}
{{L|Hunson|Here's an SD card, some twist ties.}}
{{L|Marceline|I don't want any of this junk!}} 
{{L|Hunson|Hey! I'm gonna need a place to sleep tonight. Do you have an air mattress?}} 
{{L|Marceline|Yeah.}}
{{L|Hunson|Great! You can sleep on the air mattress, and I'll sleep on your bed.}}
{{L|Marceline|It's in the closet.}}
{{L|Hunson|Finn, are you gonna let my little girl blow up that air mattress?}} 
{{L|Finn|Not on my watch!}} 
{{L|Marceline|Hey, Dad, I think I'm gonna go out for a walk before bedtime.}}
{{L|Finn|But, Marcy don't you have a solo gig tonight?}} 
{{L|Marceline|Ss-ss-ss-ss!}} 
{{L|Jake|I get it. It's air mattress talk. Ss-ss-ss-ss. Aren't you giving a concert tonight? Ss-ss-ss. At the Ghost Amphitheater? Ss-ss-ss.}}
{{L|Hunson|Concert? It's a good thing your friends remembered that.}}
{{L|MarcelineThanks, Jake.}}
{{L|Hunson|Let's go!}} 
{{L|Marceline|[''sighs'']}} 
{{L|Chicle|[''chuckling'']}} 
{{L|Finn|Do you hear, like, a really stupid-sounding laugh?}}
{{L|Jake|Yes.}}
{{L|Chicle|I have a nice laugh.}}
{{L|[''Finn, Jake, Marceline, and Hunson enter the [[Cemetery]]'']}} 
{{L|Chicle|Time to blend in completely unnoticed. [''He phases into a ghost disguise'']}}
{{L|Unnamed Ghost|[''gasps'']}} 
{{L|Chicle|Hey, what you got there? Peanuts?}}
{{L|Marceline|Hello, Hamburger Hills Cemetery!}}
{{L|[''Marceline appears in a fog on stage, and the audience cheers and applauds'']}}  
{{L|Hunson|Marceline! You're doing great, baby!}} 
{{L|Marceline|I haven't started yet.[''sings [[Slow Dance With You]]'']}} 
{{L|Hunson|Hey, Pennebaker! No illegal recording unless you're family. Yoink. [''whispering''] Just ignore me.}}
{{L|Marceline|Dad! You're wrecking the show!}} 
{{L|Hunson|This is my daughter! I am proud of my punk daughter! I made that!}} 
{{L|Jake|Sit down, man!}} 
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Yeah, you're killing the vibe.}}
{{L|Hunson|I'm just explaining my part in all this.}}
{{L|Chicle|Ugh. This is terrible. Boo, I say.}}
{{L|Ghost|Yeah! Boooo!}} 
{{L|[''crowds starts booing'']}}
{{L|Hunson|Don't worry, honey. I'll work the crowd. Hey, it's me Hunson! I'm happy to field any questions from you dummies.}}
{{L|Chicle|Can you believe Marceline has a bougie trash daddy? I heard this guy even eats ghosts, you know, like us.}}
{{L|Ghost|What? Really?!}} 
{{L|Hunson|Sure, sometimes.}}
{{L|Ghost|Off the stage, skin sack!}} 
{{L|Hunson|Okay, okay, settle down, pal. Don't make me come out there.}}
{{L|Ghost|What you gonna do "eat my fries?"}}
{{L|[''one of the ghosts spits some ectoplasm into his hand, and throws it at Hunson, but he dodges it and it instead hits Marcline's bass'']}}
{{L|Marceline|[''gasps''] My bass!}} 
{{L|[''laughter'']}} 
{{L|Hunson|Come on, ectoplasm comes right off. [''goes to lick it off'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Don't! You wreck everything.}}
{{L|[''laughter'']}}
{{L|[''Hunson jumps out into the crowd to attack the heckling ghosts'']}} 
{{L|Ghost|Mad daddy!}} 
{{L|Hunson|Hammer fist strike!}} 
{{L|Chicle|Let's get him, fellas.}}
{{L|Hunson|Ha-ha!}}
{{L|[''The ghosts turn red and attack Hunson'']}}  
{{L|Marceline|Dad, quit clowning.}}
{{L|Hunson|Uh, just havin' a little fun.[''tries to turn his hand into a claw, but is restrained by the hnadcuffs'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Come on, Dad, fight back!}} 
{{L|Finn|He can't. Pep Buts bound his powers.}}
{{L|Marcline|What?!}} 
{{L|Hunson|They sassed you.}}
{{L|Finn|Better pop that cork, Peps.}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|All right. All right.}}
{{L|[''Chicle throws a peanut at peppermint butler's head, which knocks him to the ground'']}}
{{L|[''Chicle morphs back into his original form'']}} 
{{L|Finn|Chicle!}} 
{{L|Chicle|Oh, whoops, was that bad? [''laughs, and becomes invisible'']}}
{{L|[''The ghosts begin to entrap Hunson. Marceline flings her bass at them, but it phases through.'']}}
{{L|Ghost|Vampires can't hurt ghosts, stupid.}}
{{L|Marceline|[''the ghosts fully trap the two of them in their tentacle-like arms''] Shoot.}}
{{L|Finn|Finn's turn! [''Finn uses the night sword to cut Marceline and Hunson free'']}}
{{L|Ghost|Wha?!}} 
{{L|Marceline|[''morphs into a bat monster and flies them away''] Good night, Hamburger Hills! There will be no encore.}}
{{L|[[Princess Bubblegum]]|My gracious. I'm so sorry you had to deal with Cousin Chicle's schemes. My family's out of control.}}
{{L|Hunson|It's fine. My cool daughter took care of it. And guess what I got from a vendor. [''pulls out a big shirt with Marcline's face on it''] It looks too big to me. But they said that's the style now with punk rockers.}}
{{L|Marceline|Thanks for standing up for me tonight.}}
{{L|Hunson|I'm bad, but I'm no so bad, right? So when are you gonna have some kids?}} 
{{L|Marceline|Dad!}}
