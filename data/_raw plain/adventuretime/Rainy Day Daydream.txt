{{L|[''The episode begins at the [[Tree Fort]]. The camera pans to the bridge linking the living room and attic.'']}}
{{L|[[Finn]]| [''Laughs''] Ahhh... YEAH!!! [''Busts through living room door and lands on bridge.'']}}
{{L|[[Jake]]| [''Entering''] Heh heh. [''Deep voice''] Aw, yeah. [''Chuckles'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls. [''Slaps Jake's nose; Jake does a snorting laugh''] Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure!}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa, really?!}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, man!! [''He slaps Jake's nose again, making him snort and laugh again''] I wrote on my arm this to-do list of cool junk. [''The clouds begin to get darker and bigger''] Number one: back flip off this bridge and do the splits. Number two: track down and slay a goblin horde. Number three...[''Glances up at thundering clouds''] storm clouds?}}
{{L|Jake| [''Examining''] Hmmm... [''Knives fall from the clouds and Jake gasps.''] Finn... it's a knife storm!! [''Finn slaps Jake's nose yet again''] It's raining knives, man! Come on! [''Exits'']}}
{{L|Finn| I've never seen a [[Knife storm|knife storm]] before... It's beautiful.}}
{{L|[''Knives begin falling near Finn; Jake pulls Finn inside before knives can fall on him.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid.}}
{{L|Finn| Well, what're we gonna do?}}
{{L|[[BMO]]| Who wants to play video games??}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| BMO!!}}
{{L|Jake| What's on the menu, BMO?}}
{{L|BMO| I've created a new game called [[Conversation Parade]].}}
{{L|Finn| Hah! Alright!}}
{{L|Jake| Start it up, BMO!}}
{{L|BMO| [singing] What do you think about the stars in the sky?}}
{{L|Finn| 'S okay, I guess.}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, they're cool.}}
{{L|BMO| That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn...}}
{{L|Finn| Booooo.}}
{{L|Jake| BMO, that was weak.}}
{{L|Finn| What now?}}
{{L|Jake| Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!}}
{{L|Finn| Whoa! What?!}}
{{L|Jake| Let's use our imaginations, man!}}
{{L|Finn| Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that.}}
{{L|Jake| Eh. Your loss. [''Beat''] AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!! [''Panicking and jumping around''] Lava on the floor!}}
{{L|Finn| Shut up, man...}}
{{L|Jake| Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!}}
{{L|Finn| I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality. [''Moves his foot nearer and nearer to the floor'']}}
{{L|Jake| NOOOOO!!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Places foot on floor; it suddenly catches fire''] AAAAH!!! [''Putting fire out''] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!}}
{{L|Jake| I was just playin' around with my imagination... [''In Jake's view, everything is on fire and lava is on the floor''] ...and then everything got intense.}}
{{L|Finn| It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!}}
{{L|Jake| [''To himself''] Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...}}
{{L|Finn| Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries.}}
{{L|[''Everything in the room begins to melt.'']}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| WHOA!}}
{{L|Finn| But first stop imagining lava!}}
{{L|Jake| I can't! My imagination's too amazing!}}
{{L|Finn| Imagine turning your imagination off!}}
{{L|Jake| I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an [[Imagination machine|imagination turning-off machine]]... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters.}}
{{L|Finn| Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?}}
{{L|Jake| You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!}}
{{L|Finn| Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!}}
{{L|Jake| Neat! [''Finn and he enter the den''] Grab that missile.}}
{{L|Finn| Okay.}}
{{L|Jake| And... get that [[cosmic gauntlet]].}}
{{L|Finn| Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH! [''Finn leaps into an invisible wall.''] What did I just hit?!}}
{{L|Jake| I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.}}
{{L|Finn| Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, there's one now. [''Troll roars''] Look out!}}
{{L|Finn| Aah! I can feel it on my foot! [''They stumble over, and Finn's shoe seemingly floats in midair.''] I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!}}
{{L|Jake| You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!}}
{{L|Finn| Yah, yah! [''Finn's blows finally start to land.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Alright! You're gettin' him, man! [Finn continues attacking] Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family. [''Finn kicks in the air and a scream is heard.''] Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face! [''Troll wife yells incomprehensibly.''] She's comin' back for revenge.}}
{{L|Finn| Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!}}
{{L|[Finn leaps out the window into the knife storm.]}}
{{L|Jake| The knife storm, remember?!?! [''Finn frantically pulls himself and Jake up to the attic. They rest and pant heavily.''] Oh, boy... Ooh... Finn, I found some candy. [''Eats some''] It tastes like banana candy, man. [''Sips drink''] Here, man. Try some.}}
{{L|[''Finn eats some candy.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Standing up''] Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.}}
{{L|Jake| Okay! [''Does it''] It is done.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Walks out cautiously''] Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!}}
{{L|[[Riddle Master]]| No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle.}}
{{L|Finn| [''To Jake''] An imaginary riddle master?}}
{{L|[''Jake laughs sillily.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Sighs''] Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test.}}
{{L|Riddle Master| Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Ready''] LAY IT ON ME!!}}
{{L|Riddle Master| Yes, um... The riddle, uh... It... cometh... uh...}}
{{L|Jake| I can't imagine a riddle.}}
{{L|Finn| Dude, just make it super easy.}}
{{L|Riddle Master| THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle?}}
{{L|Finn| Man, that riddle sucks.}}
{{L|Riddle Master| THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!!}}
{{L|Finn| YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!}}
{{L|[''Finn launches it and it explodes on the other side of the bridge. Finn and Jake scream in pain.'']}}
{{L|Jake| You exploded the snakes right at us!!}}
{{L|Finn| I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!}}
{{L|Jake| I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!}}
{{L|Finn| Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!}}
{{L|Jake|AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!! [''Finn evades the obstacle.''] Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck! [''Finn jumps up and does so. A weapon is heard charging up. Jake gasps.''] The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!}}
{{L|Finn| Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!}}
{{L|[''Bazooka Goblin laughs.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Don't you do it...}}
{{L|[''Bazooka Goblin continues laughing.'']}}
{{L|Finn| DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!}}
{{L|Bazooka Goblin| Hee... heehee... hee... Okay.}}
{{L|Jake| YEAH!}}
{{L|Finn| AW, YEAH!}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake laugh and do a celebratory fist bump.]}}
{{L|Finn| Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me.}}
{{L|Jake| Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed.}}
{{L|Finn| Is it clear?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you.}}
{{L|[''Finn fidgets around and mumbles to himself ("Ah... where, ah... Where is this, I ca—Ah... man.") before finding the machine.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Oh! I found the shut-off lever!}}
{{L|Jake| Cool, man! [''Invisible girl giggles.''] Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby. [''Another girl giggles.''] What're you laughin' at?}}
{{L|Finn| Alright. I'm gonna turn it off. [''Finn is suddenly hit by an invisible force.''] UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!}}
{{L|Jake| Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!}}
{{L|Finn| What?! Well, how do I kill it?! [''Finn gets beaten down.'']}}
{{L|Jake| I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this! [''Punches it''] Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!}}
{{L|Finn| Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!! [''Finn pulls the lever; Jake falls down; Finn's wounds are healed.''] Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake? [''Jake groans.''] Hey, come on. Wake up, man.}}
{{L|[''Finn pats Jake a few times.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Completely regular tone''] Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy.}}
{{L|Finn| Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?}}
{{L|Jake| I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.}}
{{L|Finn| Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!}}
{{L|Jake| But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you.}}
{{L|Finn| Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing. [''Sighs'']}}
{{L|[''Jake reaches for his viola and plays a continuous G♮'']}} 
{{L|Finn| Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note.}}
{{L|Jake| One note is all that is needed.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Scoffs''] I'm gonna turn your imagination back on. [''Fidgets around and mumbles to self''] Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!}}
{{L|Jake| True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?}}
{{L|Finn| I remembereth.}}
{{L|Jake| I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.}}
{{L|Finn| No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now... [''Saddened''] ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go... [''Finn appears in his imagination land.''] What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad. [''Imagination back-on machine appears''] Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!}}
{{L|[''Suddenly, the [[Lyre Player]] enters dancing and singing the Imagination Song.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Disappointed''] Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something. [''He imagines a penguin, and a bowl of spaghetti. The Lyre Player trips over the former and lands in the latter; Finn laughs.''] Now for that switch.}}
{{L|[[Bellamy Bug]]| [''Entering''] Good morrow, sir! My name is Bellamy Bug! Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy.}}
{{L|Finn| No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!}}
{{L|Bellamy Bug| [''Giggles''] I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!}}
{{L|Finn| REPRESENT THIS! [''Smacks Bellamy''] And this. [''Imagines two arms protruding out of Bellamy (one cephalopodic and one robotic) which both punch him.'']}}
{{L|Bellamy| Oh! I say! Oh! Ah! Ouch! Ah!}}
{{L|[''Penguins take Bellamy away.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright. [''Runs over to the machine''] I hope this works, Jake! [''Pulls lever; Jake's imagination returns.''] Haha, yeah! [''A fairy comes near the machine giggling.''] Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button! [''The fairy does.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Jake's head grows rapidly''] Aaaah!! I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!}}
{{L|Finn| ''[Frustrated sigh''] Take a hike, fairy! Normal style! [Pushes "NORMAL STYLE" button]}}
{{L|Jake| [Head shrinks] Aw, man... I imagined my [[Margaret|mom]] naked! [''Finn appears next to him.''] Yugh!}}
{{L|Finn| You okay?}}
{{L|Jake| I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure!}}
{{L|Finn| I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here... [''Thinking''] with... lava on the floor!}}
{{L|Jake| Huh?! [''Body starts melting''] AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding. [''Chuckles and reforms his body.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hahahaha! Good dog. [''He pets Jake, and the episode ends.'']}}
