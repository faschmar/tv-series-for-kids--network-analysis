{{L|[''The [[Frog Carrying Crown]] is walking through the desert. The screen pans out to show an exhausted [[Finn]] and [[Jake]] following close behind.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Dude, how long are we gonna follow this frog?}}
{{L|Finn| Patience, man. Something's totally gonna happen.}}
{{L|Jake| Ahhh, so hot!}}
{{L|Water Nymph| Yo, Finn and Jake! [''shows the water nymphs tubing down a river to the right''] If you can't take the heat, get off the kitchen! [''laughs''] Uh, wait. Come tube with us! [''laughs''].}}
{{L|Finn| Sorry, water nymphs, we've gotta follow that frog. I just gotta see him put on that crown.}}
{{L|Jake| What! I thought we were following him back to his treasure hoard.}}
{{L|Finn| I ain't in it for the money. I'm doing it for the sake of discovery... and the ladies.}}
{{L|Jake| There's no ladies!}}
{{L|Water Nymph|[''pointing at herself''] We're ladies! [''laughs'']}}
{{L|Jake| Let's just swim with the water nymphs.}}
{{L|Finn| Gotta see it.}}
{{L|Jake|[''groans''] Hey, you! Frog! Look what you're doing to the boy!}}
{{L|Finn|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''sweating''<nowiki>] Uuuggghh</nowiki>}}
{{L|[''The frog looks back at Finn, then turns away and continues walking.'']}}
{{L|Jake|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''quietly''<nowiki>] Put on the crown. [</nowiki>''angrily''<nowiki>] Put on that crown!</nowiki>}}
{{L|Finn| Ugh, be cool Jake. [''he takes off his hat, and uses it to tie his hair into a large bun''] What if he puts it on and turns into, like, a beautiful wish dragon?}}
{{L|[''The frog lifts the crown above his head. Finn and Jake gasp, but the frog doesn't put the crown on and continues holding it by his side.'']}}
{{L|Jake| THAT'S IT! [''he stretches his arms and puts the crown on the frog's head''] Ha! There, you've seen it! Now let's- eh, what?}}
{{L|[''The frog starts emitting a rumbling sound'']}}
{{L|Water Nymph| Ah, you've done it now! You know the old saying; You can lead a frog to crown, but you can't... you can't... don't look him in the mouth.}}
{{L|[''The frog expands into a monster form.'']}}
{{L|Jake| You take off that crown!}}
{{L|[''Jake screams as the monster frog approaches, and lifts his gut over them, preparing to crush them.'']}}
{{L|Water Nymph| OHHHHH, he's about to drop a gut! [''the frog crushes Finn and Jake with his gut''] Dang!}}
{{L|[''The frog picks them up and throws them into his mouth.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''in the stomach''] I think it's actually cooler in here.}}
