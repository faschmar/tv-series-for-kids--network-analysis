{{L|[''The episode begins in the [[Tree Fort]]'s kitchen, where [[Jake]] is preparing a meal.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''sets table''] [[Finn]], lunch is ready!}}
{{L|Finn|[''holds nose''] Ugh, what are you cooking?}}
{{L|Jake|It's good! I learned it from [[Lady Rainicorn|Rainicorn]].}}
{{L|Finn|I'm not eatin' that. It smells funny.}}
{{L|Jake|Dude, this took me, like—}}
{{L|Finn|Let's go over to [[Tree Trunks (character)|Tree Trunks]]'s and get some [[Apple Pie (food)|apple pie]]! Apple pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Let's go! [''grabs Jake's arm'']}}
{{L|Jake|Whoa! [''grabs a shrimp from his plate before he leaves''] Eh.}}
{{L|[''Scene changes to [[Tree Trunks' house]].'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''knocking on door''] Tree Trunks! [''opens door and walks in with Jake''] [''gasps'']}}
{{L|[''Tree Trunks is lying on the floor next to a broken table, motionless.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''running over to her''] Tree Trunks! Tree Trunks?}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|[''mumbling''] Apples... my apples...}}
{{L|Jake|Apples?}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|You! [''jumps at Jake''] You took my apples! [''starts hitting Jake'']}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa, whoa! [''grabs Tree Trunks''] Tree Trunks, it's us, Finn and Jake!}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Finn... and, and Jake?}}
{{L|Finn|It's okay, Tree Trunks. We're here to help you. Just tell us what happened.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|[''tearing up''] They took 'em. They took all of 'em.}}
{{L|Jake|All of what?}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Apples. My apples that I raised with love from, from mere seedlings. Without my special apples, I won't be able to bake any more apple pies.}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|NOOOOOOOO!}}
{{L|Finn|Don't you worry, Tree Trunks. We'll find those thieves and bring them to justice.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Let me show you the crime scene. [''leads them outside''] You see, boys: scads of apple trees but, but no apples.}}
{{L|Finn|Hmm. Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks?}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|No, Finn, they didn't touch my rocks, or my birds, or my flowers, or, or nothing.}}
{{L|Finn|Hm. Well, I don't see any footprints. What'cha got, Jake?}}
{{L|Jake|[''patting the air''] No [[Ghosts|ghost]] doodies. Oh. Oh, wait. [''feeling something invisible''] Oh, no. No.}}
{{L|Finn|Hm. Tree Trunks, is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up?}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Oh, no, Finn. I take great care to assure that-that I'm loved by even the most heinous cretins—}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, guys, I found something! Look!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Tree Trunks join Jake at the edge of a hole.'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Uh!}}
{{L|[[Raggedy Princess]]|Oh, heheh, hey, Finn. Heheh.}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess. Have you seen anything fishy going on?}}
{{L|Raggedy Princess|Um, no, heheh. I've been kinda down in this hole for a long time. [''laughs nervously''] I got knocked down here by some ne'er-do-wells. It was terrible. I was so scared.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Ne'er-do-wells? They stole my apples. [''flapping ears''] I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty!}}
{{L|Finn|[''laughs''] Awesome. Where do we find these guys?}}
{{L|Jake|Oh, the [[Candy Tavern]], man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses.}}
{{L|Finn|[''jaw drops with "brring" sound effect'']}}
{{L|Jake|Don't worry, I stopped doing that a long time ago. I didn't know it was wrong.}}
{{L|Finn|[''jaw still hanging, with higher "brring" sound effect'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Okay, you two, let's get going.}}
{{L|[''Scene changes to outside the Candy Tavern. Someone gets thrown out of the window.'']}}
{{L|[[Candy Tavern People|Candy Tavern Person]]|Whoa!}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|[''gasps''] Oh, my!}}
{{L|[''The three enter the tavern. A [[Candy People|Candy Person]] at the bar repeatedly stabs his hand with a spoon, and [[Cookie Guy|an angry cookie]] shakes.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Uh, does [[Princess Bubblegum]] know about this place?}}
{{L|Jake|Be cool, man. You're gonna queer the deal.}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, yeah. Try not to act suspicious, Tree Trunks.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Okay, I won't.}}
{{L|[''The three walk up to the [[Candy Tavern Bartender]].'']}}
{{L|Finn & Tree Trunks|Where—?}}
{{L|Finn|Oh. [''motions for Tree Trunks to continue'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Where's my dang apples?}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, [''laughs''] Tree Trunks, you're so silly. But, but listen, you wouldn't happen to have seen any—I don't know—apples around, have you?}}
{{L|Bartender|"Seen any apples?" Y'all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions... almost like you're trying to ''solve'' somethin'.}}
{{L|Finn|What? Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.}}
{{L|Bartender|Mmm... clean, too. Almost like some [''pounds bar''] do-gooders!}}
{{L|Jake|Hold on, we gotta go potty.}}
{{L|[''The three enter the bathroom and rub dirt all over their bodies.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Dang. They almost got us, but I think we blend in pretty well now.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|[''licking toilet paper''] This, this toilet paper's drying my mouth all up.}}
{{L|Finn|Uh, Tree Trunks, don't eat that. [''sighs''] Here. [''holds her up to the mirror''] [''whispers to Jake''] You gotta watch her, man!}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Oh, I look just like an army brat!}}
{{L|[''The three return to the bartender.'']}}
{{L|Bartender|What can I do for you?}}
{{L|Finn|[''pouring drink onto bar''] You know where a guy might maybe score some apples? [''drops mug onto the floor, shattering it'']}}
{{L|Bartender|Well, when you put it like that.... A couple of buddies I know have some apples for sale. I'll show you.}}
{{L|[''He leads them to a back door and opens it to [[Smudge|a tall gingerbread man]] and [[Jaybird|an upside-down ice cream cone]].'']}}
{{L|Bartender|Hey, fellas, these folks been askin' 'bout your... apples?}}
{{L|Jaybird|[''scratches chin''] Okay, show 'em the apples, Smudge.}}
{{L|[''Smudge picks up a trash can and puts it over Jake.'']}}
{{L|Jaybird|Grab 'em!}}
{{L|[''The bartender grabs Finn and Tree Trunks.'']}}
{{L|Jaybird|You go back, and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples 'cause they're ours now!}}
{{L|Finn|Wha-what boss?}}
{{L|Jaybird|Your boss! [[Dr. J]]?}}
{{L|Finn|We don't know any Dr. J.}}
{{L|Jaybird|[''punches Finn's forehead''] Liars! Come on, Smudge [''walks off''] [''mumbling''] ...gonna take ''my'' apples.}}
{{L|[''The bartender drops Finn and Tree Trunks and closes the door. Jake takes the trash can off.'']}}
{{L|Jake|What just happened?}}
{{L|Finn|I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks' apples also stole Dr. J's apples, and they thought we were workin' for him!}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Finn? Finn.}}
{{L|Finn|Hm?}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|This could be dangerous, a-and if you want to go back home, I understand, but I need to do this.}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, Tree Trunks, me too.}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, Finn.}}
{{L|Finn|Hm?}}
{{L|Jake|[''pointing to mark''] What's that on your face, buddy?}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, that guy bopped me one. Must've had a ring on.}}
{{L|Jake|Y'know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before. Yeah, right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes.}}
{{L|Finn|What?!}}
{{L|Jake|I didn't know it was wrong.}}
{{L|[''Scene changes to the outskirts of the Candy Kingdom.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''points to a building with the mark''] Yeah, you see? That guy must work here or somethin'.}}
{{L|[''The three walk up to the building.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''knocks on the door''] Hello?}}
{{L|[[Wormo]]|[''through door''] Who's the heck happening? What?}}
{{L|Finn|Uh, we're here about the apples?}}
{{L|Wormo|Oh, okay. Let's see your ring.}}
{{L|Finn|Um...}}
{{L|Jake|Here. [''forms a ring on his finger and shows it to Wormo'']}}
{{L|Wormo|[''opens door''] Come on in. Follow this guy. [''leads them in'']}}
{{L|[''Before the door closes, someone stops it with their foot.'']}}
{{L|Wormo|[''leading them downstairs''] My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples. A whole crate. [''shows them a crate of diamonds'']}}
{{L|Finn|What the?}}
{{L|Wormo|What's wrong, guy?}}
{{L|Finn|These aren't apples.}}
{{L|Wormo|Oh, ya didn't mean diamonds? All ne'er-do-wells call diamonds "apples." Like calling money "bread" or rock-knockers "butter-slaps."}}
{{L|Jaybird|[''opening door''] Hey, Wormo, we're back—what the?! [''points to Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks''] What are they doing here?}}
{{L|Wormo|They're here for the apples.}}
{{L|Jaybird|That's the dang Dr. J gang, Wormo! Grab 'em!}}
{{L|[''Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks are tied up.'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Um, sir? [''laughs nervously''] I promise if you let us go, we won't tell no one about your apples.}}
{{L|Wormo|Feed 'em to [[Mr. Pig|the pig]].}}
{{L|Smudge|Yeah, the pig.}}
{{L|Jaybird|Heheh, yeah, all right. [''walks offscreen and returns carrying Mr. Pig'']}}
{{L|Mr. Pig|Uh, I'm sorry, y'all. They're makin' me do this. I-I'll try to make it quick.}}
{{L|Dr. J|Hold it!}}
{{L|[''Dr. J and his gang appear.'']}}
{{L|Jaybird|Dr. J! [''drops pig'']}}
{{L|Dr. J|Yeah, yeah, and I want my apples back.}}
{{L|Jaybird & Dr. J| [''in unison''] Get 'em, boys!}}
{{L|[''While the gangs fight, Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks free themselves from the rope, and Jake brings the pig with them to Tree Trunks' house.'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|[''starts sobbing'']}}
{{L|Finn|Aw, don't cry, Tree Trunks.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|But we're never gonna find those apples.}}
{{L|Mr. Pig|Apples? You guys looking for apples?}}
{{L|Jake|Uh, yeah, why?}}
{{L|Mr. Pig|'Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room.}}
{{L|Jake|Wait, you mean "apples" as "diamonds"?}}
{{L|Mr. Pig|No.}}
{{L|Jake|"Apples" as "apples"?}}
{{L|Mr. Pig|Yep.}}
{{L|Finn|You mean apples that we eat?}}
{{L|Mr. Pig|Yes.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|With all due respect, Mr. Pig, sir, my apples were stolen by a dirty, rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail.}}
{{L|Mr. Pig|I'm just telling you the facts, ma'am. What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet. [''points to wardrobe''] They sound scared.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Well, I hate to tell you this, boys, but there's no apples in this closet. [''sticks tail into keyhole''] You see, uh, I'm the only one who knows how to open this closet. [''opens it'']}}
{{L|[''Dozens of apples spill out.'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|[''gasp'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Oh, so I was the apple thief after all.}}
{{L|Finn|No, Tree Trunks, that's preposterous.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|No, Finn, I'm a criminal, [''picks up phone and dials 911''] and I need to pay the price.}}
{{L|[[Banana Guard]] [''over phone'']|Banana Guard speaking.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Uh, this is Tree Trunks. I've done somethin' horrible, and I want you to come over and arrest me.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake exchange sad looks.'']}}
{{L|[''Scene changes to outside the house, with Tree Trunks in handcuffs and two Banana Guards standing by.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Tree Trunks, you don't need to do this.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime. Goodbye.}}
{{L|Finn|Tree Trunks.}}
{{L|Banana Guard|Ah, this is hard to watch. I'm gonna look away.}}
{{L|[''Several crows fly out of the forest.'']}}
{{L|Banana Guard|This place could use a scarecrow.}}
{{L|Finn|Huh? Wait, what'd you say?}}
{{L|Banana Guard|Uh, I-I said this place could use a scarecrow.}}
{{L|Finn|A scarecrow, no footprints, all those magpies on the roof, Raggedy Princess in the ditch, and all the apples in Tree Trunks's closet.}}
{{L|Banana Guard [''in Finn's memory'']|Boy, this place could use a scarecrow.}}
{{L|Finn|That's it! [''climbs onto Tree Trunks' house's roof''] I knew it!}}
{{L|[''A nest is next to a hole in the roof. A magpie brings an apple to its chicks, but the apple falls into the hole.'']}}
{{L|Finn|The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole!}}
{{L|Jake|And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree!}}
{{L|Finn|Yes. And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off!}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Does this mean I'm innocent?}}
{{L|Jake|As innocent as a baby's butt cheek!}}
{{L|Finn|[''jumps off roof''] [''laughs''] Awesome! This calls for a celebration! You know what that means, Tree Trunks!}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|I'ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted. [''strains and breaks the handcuffs'']}}
{{L|Banana Guards|Whoa.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|[''to Banana Guards''] Uh, you boys better stick around if you want a bite of my apple pie. [''slaps Banana Guard'']}}
{{L|Banana Guard|She slapped my butt!}}
{{L|[''The other Banana Guard gives a thumbs up.'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|[''laughs'']}}
{{L|[''The others join in.'']}}
