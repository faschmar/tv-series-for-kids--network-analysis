{{L|[''The screen opens on the newly green mountain from [[Frog Seasons: Winter]], but pans down to show [[Finn]] and [[Jake]] gliding down a  shimmering river (Jake is stretched out like a canoe, which Finn is sitting in).'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, Jake, what do you think this river is made of?}}
{{L|Jake| Man, I don't even want to know.}}
{{L|Finn| Then why'd you put your face in it?}}
{{L|Jake| 'Cause I'm the figurehead!}}
{{L|Finn| So then [[Lumpy Space Princess|LSP]] was all, "Get out of my kitchen, Finn". "Exactly what part of this forest is your kitchen?" I says, and she was all, "I dunno how big is this forest?"}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake laugh, and Jake bumps into [[Breezy (character)|Breezy]].'']}}
{{L|Breezy| Oh!}}
{{L|Jake| Whoops, sorry Breezy. Didn't see you there.}}
{{L|Breezy| That's ok, Jake. Your head is surprisingly soft!}}
{{L|Jake| That's my sweet neckroll. [''Jake shows bumps on his neck, similar to a triple-chin''] Wababababababa! [''Jake jiggles his neckroll'']}}
{{L|Finn| So what are you doing in the river, bee?}}
{{L|Breezy| I'm panning for gold.}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Gold?!}}
{{L|Breezy| Gold!}}
{{L|Finn| Are you deckin' out the hive?}}
{{L|Breezy| Don't be silly, Finn. It's for [[Honey Man]]. [''Honey Man is seen with his honey sticking to the grass''] Hey, would you guys like to help?}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Yes we would!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Finn and Jake are seen panning for gold''] Hey, Finn, you know what? This all ''panned'' out pretty good.}}
{{L|Finn| Man that joke was... [''Finn lifts up a handful of gold''] Gold! [''Jake laughs''] Are you impressed by my brilliant ''nugget''?}}
{{L|Finn|[''Breezy walks over to the Honey Man and puts gold in his hands.''] Hang on there's more! Here you go, big guy. [''Finn puts his gold in the Honey Man's hands'']}}
{{L|Jake| Bling! [''Jake throws his gold into the Honey Man's hands'']}}
{{L|[''The Honey Man pours the gold into the top of his head.'']}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Woah!}}
{{L|[''The Honey Man begins spinning and dancing, causing his honey to fly everywhere.'']}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Wow- eewww. [''they are impressed until the honey lands all over them'']}}
{{L|Breezy| Yeah, this isn't even the best part!}}
{{L|[''The Honey Man continues to dance, and his honey lands on all the plants, making them bloom. The Honey Man then spits a crown into his hands.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Sweet crown, man.}}
{{L|Jake| Hmm, I could swear I've seen that crown before. [''the [[Frog Carrying Crown|frog]] walks by and picks up the crown, causing Finn and Jake to gasp'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, we've gotta follow that frog. [''they run away''] Bye, Breezy! So what do you think will happen when he puts on that crown?}}
{{L|Jake| Maybe he'll turn into a time vortex.}}
{{L|[''Finn laughs and pushes back a branch as he walks past. When he lets go, the honey on the leaf flies into the air, lands on a flower, and causes it to bloom.'']}}
