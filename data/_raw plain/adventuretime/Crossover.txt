{{L|[''The screen starts white, then shows Finn and Jake in snowsuits walking through the heavy snow. Finn looks up, and they see a big fortress made of ice, with green clouds swirling above. Finn and Jake then crawl up the ice, revealing people are frozen inside each block.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Wow, everything sucks here!}}
{{L|Jake|Finn, look!}}
{{L|Finn|Oh jeez, this looks pretty real. [''shows [[The Enchiridion (book)|The Enchiridion]] floating above a pit of green liquid and ice''] He's got the Enchiridion! [''shows [[Bobby (Farmworld Billy)|Bobby]] trapped in ice, but part of his sword, as well as most of his head, are sticking out unfrozen''] And, wait, is that Billy? Why is he so tiny?}}
{{L|Jake|[''Pointing upwards''] Hey, there's our guy!}}
{{L|Farmworld/Ice Finn|[''Enters with his [[Finn's mom|mother]], [[Finn's Dad|father]], and [[Finn's Baby Brother|baby brother]] trapped in ice''] WOOHOO! HAHAHAHAHAHA! [''moves his family away from him with ice magic''] Yeah, just hang out there for a while! I love it! I feel fresh, hahahahahaha!}}
{{L|Finn|[''takes off hood and snow goggles''] Well, this is the weirdest thing I've ever done. [''Pulls a case out from his backpack'']}}
{{L|[''A blue screen appears, with white letters that say "One Hour Ago".'']}}
{{L|[''Jake is hanging from the ceiling from his feet, holding Finn's feet. Finn is holding [[BMO]]'s feet, and BMO is blindfolded and holding a knife. They are spinning in a circular motion.'']}}
{{L|Finn, Jake, and BMO|Round and round and round we go!}}
{{L|[''BMO hits a poster with his knife. The poster says "Headmaster: The Final Lesson", and it shows an angry man in a suit.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Hiya!}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[''in the same formation''] Oh yeah!}}
{{L|BMO|[''partially takes off blindfold''] School's out 'ya trench!}}
{{L|[''[[Prismo|Prismo's]] [[Prismo's Homemade Artisanal Pickles|pickle jar]] on the table starts to glow.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Woah! [''Finn, Jake, and BMO fall from the ceiling.''] Oof!}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, Prismo's calling!}}
{{L|Jake|Nice! Let's go say hi.}}
{{L|BMO|You're lucky I don't take you out, kid! [''struggling to pull the knife from the wall''] Quit crying baby!}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[''touching the pickle jar''] PRRRIIIIIIISSSSSMM- [''A burst of light takes them to Prismo.'']}}
{{L|BMO|[''falls from the wall''] Oof!}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[''sent to the [[Time Room]]''] OOOOOO!}}
{{L|Finn|TION!}}
{{L|Prismo|Thanks for responding to my call, guys! I'm in a serious pickle, and I mean the brown kind. I mean like a really smelly, brown pickle.}}
{{L|Jake|Don't sweat it, boy! Finn and I got yo' back!}}
{{L|Finn|[''makes a fist with his hand''] Who's bullying you Prismo?!}}
{{L|Prismo|Nobody's bullying me. Look, um, remember when you wished [[The Lich (character)|the lich]] never existed and you created a new wish reality that ended up totally not working out?}}
{{L|Finn|No.}}
{{L|Jake|Vaguely, yes.}}
{{L|Finn|What?}}
{{L|Jake|You don't remember making that wish!}}
{{L|Finn|Wu-huh?}}
{{L|Jake|I thought I explained it to you that one time.}}
{{L|Prismo|Dude, I'll catch you up. [''a remote appears''] Look! [''A recap video shows clips from the episodes "[[Finn the Human (episode)|Finn the Human]]" and "[[Jake the Dog (episode)|Jake the Dog]]"''] After you wished the lich never existed, you accidentally created an [[Farmworld|alternate wish reality]] where magic doesn't really exist.}}
{{L|Finn|Wait! [''The video showing Farmworld Finn pauses'']. Who's that dude?}}
{{L|Prismo|That's you! But sort of less cool.}}
{{L|Finn|Uh-huh, proceed.}}
{{L|[''The recap video shows [[Farmworld Marceline|Farmworld Marceline]]'']}}
{{L|Prismo|So you find an old Marceline and the [[Ice King's crown|crown]] on the body of [[Farmworld Simon Petrikov|Ice King's skeleton]] who was smushed under the weight of a frozen [[Mushroom Bomb|mitogenic bomb]]. But then the destiny gang steals your [[Bartram|family donkey]], so you use the crown to become Ice Finn and save your donkey and your family. But, the crown makes you crazy, and you ice everything up like a dumb bozo, which sets off the mitogenic bomb, which releases the spirit of the lich anyway. But then, this reality's Jake made a counter wish which supposedly fixed the problem, but as it turned out, it didn't really.}}
{{L|Finn|Can I just say that I don't remember any of this stuff.}}
{{L|Prismo|Because technically it didn't happen to you. But, also it still happened, and that wish reality continues to exist.}}
{{L|Finn|Is this why all of a sudden one day I was better at the flute.}}
{{L|Jake|Oh yeah, I noticed that!}}
{{L|Prismo|Listen! Something, really bad, is about to go down. [''A hologram of the Enchiridion appears above Prismo's finger''] Ice Finn is using his world's Enchiridion to build a portal to the [[Multiverse|multiverse]]. I literally do not know what will happen if he succeeds, but it could def's be catastrophic to the architecture of these realities. Now if that happens, my boss, let me repeat that, my BOSS will hold ME responsible, and by proxy, y'all both be in the dip too.}}
{{L|Finn|Why don't you just bloop bloop it all better?}}
{{L|Prismo|Something there is dampening my powers. I AM LOSING MY PICS OVER THIS BIZ!}}
{{L|Jake|[''whispering to Finn''] His boss! Who's that?}}
{{L|Finn|Alright, man, what do we do? [''a wooden case appears in Finn's hands'']}}
{{L|Prismo|Take this, and use it to take care of the Ice Finn.}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, wait what do you mean by take care o-}}
{{L|Prismo|Good luck guys we're all depending on you! [''Finn and Jake are sent to the place where the episode started at'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''now back to where the episode was before the "One hour ago" screen appeared. Finn opens the wooden case''] Woah.}}
{{L|Jake|What is it?}}
{{L|Finn|[''Finn pulls out [[The Maid]] from the wooden case''] Oh golly!}}
{{L|Jake|[''takes off snow goggles''] What's that thing now?}}
{{L|Finn|It's like 50 bowling balls on my teen bod! Oh, check it! There's instructions. [''Reads instructions''] The maid will handle all Class A interdimensional Bung-ups if you follow these simple steps: direct the small end of the Maid towards your massive mistake [''shows Farmworld/Ice Finn'']. Focus your intention until all distractions leave your thought sphere [''shows Bobby struggling to get out of the ice'']. Then recite the words "A man needs a maid" three times. Alright [''struggles to lift the maid'']. Here we go! [''to Jake''] Help help help help help help help! [''puts one end of the maid on Jake's back, and a fart noise is heard'']}}
{{L|Jake|Lower it!}}
{{L|Finn|Ledge ledge ledge! [''puts down the maid on the ledge''] Ok! Focus my intention. [''looks at Ice Finn'']}}
{{L|Farmworld/Ice Finn|Just a few more jewels before I can open the portal to a better world!}}
{{L|Finn|My intention to heal the madness of this other self.}}
{{L|Jake|Wait, wait, wait. I don't think that's what we're supposed to do. Prismo said take care of him.}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, that means make him feel better.}}
{{L|Jake|Are you being stupid on purpose?}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, but dude, that is me!}}
{{L|[[Finn Sword]]|That's me!}}
{{L|Jake|I heard you the first time!}}
{{L|Finn|There's gotta be something else we can do.}}
{{L|Jake|Bro, you heard Prismo, we don't have a choice.}}
{{L|Finn|[''inhales and exhales''] Ok, but you do it! I just can't man i- it's too messed up.}}
{{L|Jake|Alright, you're right. Shut your eyes and cover your ears!}}
{{L|Finn|[''Closes eyes and covers ears''] Mamamamamamama.}}
{{L|Jake|[''exhales''] A man needs a maid [''shows Ice Finn'']. [''Exhales and wipes sweat off his face''] A man... needs... a maid. A maaaaan [''shows Ice Finn''], needs... a... [''shows Jake with a ton of sweat on his face'']. Nope! This is bull juice!}}
{{L|Prismo|[''still in time room''] Oh, flip!}}
{{L|Finn|Mamamamama-}}
{{L|Jake|hey, hey!}}
{{L|Finn|Did you do it?}}
{{L|Jake|Nah man! Let's just go steal the Enchiridion.}}
{{L|Finn|Woah yeah! That way he can't open the portal and nobody gets obliterated! [''shows Prismo watching from the Time Room''] That should work!}}
{{L|Prismo|That's not gonna work you guys! Don't walk away from the maid! NOOOOO!}}
{{L|Farmworld/Ice Finn|[''holding some ice blocks with people in them with his ice magic''] It's gonna be so great in the next place, guys! It's like we're spinning, spinning, spinning into the new land! [''shows Finn and Jake sneaking towards the Enchiridion''] Hahahahahahahaha! Woohoo! Hahahahaha! [Finn is walking to the Enchiridion'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''pulls on the Enchiridion''] Sneaky fashion! [''the Enchiridion is not moving, Farmworld/Ice Finn blasts Finn and Jake away'']}}
{{L|Farmworld/Ice Finn|What's this? Oh! Two more converts to my empire of frost!?}}
{{L|Jake|Finn, I love you! Just in case we eat it fighting this guy.}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, yeah, I love you too.}}
{{L|Farmworld//Ice Finn|Hahahahahahaha! [''shoots ice fireworks''] Wonderful! I thought I'd rescued all the humans! Now you can hang out here with everyone else! Gunther says we just need a few more gems. Anyway, now I'm going to freeze you!}}
{{L|Jake|WAIT! [''stretches'']}}
{{L|Farmworld/Ice Finn|Huh?!}}
{{L|Jake|Straight up magic!}}
{{L|Farmworld/Ice Finn|Are you a wizard too?!}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, check out my amazing wizard bod! [''Farmworld/Ice Finn looks at Finn''] Hey over here man, look at me! I'm a portal to another world. [''shapeshifts into a portal'']}}
{{L|Farmworld/Ice Finn|You can't be!}}
{{L|Jake|I'm magic, I can do anything! Don't you believe your own eyes? [''Finn is sneaking towards the Enchiridion. Farmworld/Ice Finn is distracted by Jake'']}}
{{L|Farmworld/Ice Finn|Why would you be able to turn in-}}
{{L|Jake|Why anything? Why's the sky blue, bro? That's right, just keep looking at me!}}
{{L|[''Finn looks towards Bobby'']}}
{{L|Bobby|Hey, what's up?}}
{{L|Finn|I'll get you out of this, [[Billy]]!}}
{{L|Bobby|[''whispering''] It's Bobby. [''looks around''] Look out!}}
{{L|Finn|[''looks at [[Big Destiny]] walking in''] Who's that?}}
{{L|Jake|Enter the por- What? Big Destiny?}}
{{L|Big Destiny|[''drops a brown bag, jewels come out''] Jewels! [''drools from his mouth'']}}
{{L|Finn|What's wrong with him? He looks possessed or somethi- [''shows Farmworld Lich in Farmworld Jake's body, walking''] ooh, boy, here we go!}}
{{L|Jake|That's my body, dog!}}
{{L|Farmworld/Ice Finn|My friend you return! Hahahahaha! This was all his idea!}}
{{L|Jake|Come on, that's the lich! He's evil! And he's not even trying to hide it, bro!}}
{{L|Farmworld Lich|Release!}}
{{L|Big Destiny|[''released from the lich's mind-control''] Big D's mind is back! Wooo! [''running''] I must escape, first try! [''Farmworld/Ice Finn freezes him'']}}

[''Farmworld/Ice Finn angrily throws the crown at the ground, then the video pauses'']}}
