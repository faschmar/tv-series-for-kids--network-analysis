{{L|[morning in the tree house. Finn is uncomfortable in his bed.]}}
{{L|Finn|[groans]}}
{{L|[there is a sea lard in his bed]}}
{{L|Finn|Eww! The sea lard’s in my bed again. Gross.}}
{{L|Jake|Dude. That’s like the 8th time. Why don’t you just get rid of it?}}
{{L|Finn|I don’t know what’s gotten into it lately.}}
{{L|Jake|It's gross as butts, man. We’re taking care of this right now.}}

{{L|[Finn and Jake carry the sea lard outside]}}
{{L|Finn|I can’t believe we never thought of this before. The pond is the perfect place for a sea lard.}}
{{L|Jake|See ya larder!}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake throw the sea lard into the pond. It sinks.]}}

{{L|Jake|[perplexed] Huh.}}
{{L|Finn|Is he, like, okay?}}
{{L|[Shelby climbs out of under Finn’s armpit]}}
{{L|Shelby|Well, seeing as sea lards are saltwater fish, and the pond is a freshwater environment…[inhales sharply] ...no? He’s a stenohaline fish. Haven’t you guys ever heard of osmoregulation? Allow me to explain.}}
{{L|[Finn takes his pajamas off. Shelby falls.]}}
{{L|Shelby|[shrieks] Waaaa! }}
{{L|Finn|Sorry Shelby. Gotta save the lard.}}
{{L|[Finn holds his breath and jumps in. Jake follows. They swim to the bottom of the pond.]}}

{{L|Jake|[underwater] Thar!}}
{{L|Finn|[underwater] Wa?}}
{{L|[The lard floats into an underwater hole. Finn and Jake follow.]}}
{{L|[The lard emerges from the water. The frames show a massive structure of mud.]}}

{{L|Water Nymphs|[singing in harmony] ♫♪♪Smash the frogs, smash the frogs, making frog hot dogs, smash the frogs…..♫♪♪}}
{{L|Finn|[Looking around, amazed] Whoa!}}
{{L|Water Nymph (Denise)|[Emerges from behind a structure] Finn and Jake! [to other water nymphs] Yo! Finn and Jake are here!}}
{{L|Water Nymphs #2 and #3|♫♪♪Smash the frog - [interrupted, face Finn and Jake holding rolling pins] Hi!}}
{{L|Finn|So, this is where you guys live?}}
{{L|Water Nymphs #2 and #3|Yeah!}}
{{L|Water Nymph #2|We’re the guardians of this grotto.}}
{{L|Water Nymph (Denise)|You guys want to stay for lunch? We’re making hot dogs!}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[both, excited] Hot dogs?!?!}}
{{L|Finn|[realizing] Oh, wait. We dropped our sea lard in the pond, and we’ve got to save it before it dies from the freshwater. He’s a stenohaline fish.}}
{{L|[The Water Nymphs look at each other]}}
{{L|Water Nymph #3|You do know sea lards are mammals, right?}}
{{L|Finn|[embarrassed] Uhh.. I definitely knew that. [To Jake, whispering] I’m gonna murder Shelby.}}
{{L|Water Nymph (Denise)|Well, hey, you guys should stick around. I’m gonna go finish cooking. }}
{{L|Water Nymphs #2 and #3|[both] And we gotta mash more frogs.}}
{{L|[The water nymphs leave]}}

{{L|Finn|I can’t believe I just believe Shelby ‘cause he’s a nerd.}}
{{L|Jake|[agreeing] I know. It's in his tone. [Jake looks to the left] Hey, it's the lard!}}
{{L|Finn|[yelling to the lard] Hey, get away from there!}}
{{L|[The lard sinks into a whirlpool. It gasps for breath.]}}
{{L|Finn|[scoldingly] Bad lard! Lard!!}}
{{L|[water nymph (Denise) emerges from the water.]}}
{{L|Water Nymph (Denise)|[hears Finn and Jake] Huh? [realizes, yelling] Don’t go near there! It’s too dangerous!}}
{{L|Finn|[yelling] Got to save this dang lard!}}
{{L|Water Nymph (Denise)|[yelling] Whatever you do, don’t touch the purple stuff!}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake get sucked in the whirlpool]}}
{{L|Finn|[yelling] WHOOAH!}}
{{L|[The setting changes to a different dimension, where Finn and Jake are portrayed with a simpler, different art style]}}

{{L|[Finn wakes up on the ground, coughing]}}
{{L|Finn|[perplexed] What did she say? Don’t touch the purple?}}
{{L|[Jake wakes up, groaning]}}
{{L|Finn|[perplexed] What happened to the pond?}}
{{L|Jake|And how ‘bout our treehouse? The house part’s a-gone! }}
{{L|[a pink pond is shown, as well as a house-less treehouse]}}
{{L|Finn|[perplexed] What the butt?}}
{{L|Jake|I guess we went through some portal to the past or some biz.}}
{{L|Finn|[perplexed] Was stuff the wrong color in the past?}}
{{L|[The wind blows with a strange effect]}}
{{L|Finn|[scratching his chin] It's weird as carbs here.}}
{{L|Jake|[looking around, yelling] The sea lard! [Jake points] There it goes!}}
{{L|Finn|[yelling] Lard!}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake run toward the lard. The frame pans to show an alternate dimension Finn and Jake, who begin to lick from the pink pond. The pond forms a face and speaks with Princess Bubblegum’s voice.]}}
{{L|Pond|[giggling] Hello, friends!}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake continue chasing the sea lard in the woods] }}
{{L|Finn|[calling] Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard!}}
{{L|Jake|Lard, lard, lard, lard, lard}}

{{L|Finn| [singing] ♫♪♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la laaaa!♫♪♪}}
{{L|Jake|You are crazy. You are so crazy!}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake continue walking]}}
{{L|Finn|[looking around] Everything’s like, wonky here. It’s familiar, but weird.}}
{{L|Jake|[smiling] I like it.}}
{{L|Finn|I don’t know. It kind of makes me feel… naked. [Finn sees the lard and gasps.]♫♪♪ La-la-la laaaard!♫♪♪}}
{{L|[Finn grabs the lard]}}
{{L|Finn|Gotcha! Finally, we can take you home!}}
{{L|[lights capture Finn and Jake’s attention.]}}

{{L|Finn and Jake|[perplexed] Huh?}}
{{L|[Alternate dimension Marceline (Leaf Marceline] is playing her bass and singing a melancholy song with two other leaves.]}}
{{L|Leaf Marceline|[singing "[[Flower Song]]"]♫♪♪''A one-and a-two- I’d rather be anything but me, a leaf on a tree, a bug or a bee. I just want to see the sea, I want to be free from this body, this flower body.''♫♪♪}}

{{L|Finn|[In awe] Please don’t change. You’re perfect just the way you are.}}
{{L|Leaf Marceline|Oh, I know! I just like to write sad songs.}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[understanding] Ohh! [they chuckle.]}}
{{L|Finn|Wait. Hey, Jake, what were we just doing?}}
{{L|Leaf Marceline|[interrupting, singing] ♫♪♪''Chasin’ the fish, Chasin’ the fish, and its getting away''♫♪♪[Leaf Marceline points] }}
{{L|Finn|[Turns around, yelling]|Get that lard!}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake run away]}}

{{L|Leaf Marceline|[waving] Bye! [To other leaves] You guys are writing this down, right?}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake run]}}
{{L|Finn|Why does the lard keep running away? We're trying to get it home.}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, this place ain't safe.}}
{{L|[A purple sparkle hits Finn's face. Then, it begins to come down like rain.]}}
{{L|[Princess Purple Patch (Ice King) is humming a tune.]}}
{{L|Princess Purple Patch|[singing] ♫♪♪''bum-bum-bum, little purple, you're a catch, I love your pretty purple sash. We're a perfect purple match, Welcome to my purple patch''♫♪♪!}}
{{L|Princess Purple Patch|I'm Princess Purple Patch, and this is my little special Purple. [They kiss the purple] Mwah!}}
{{L|Jake|[waves] Hi, Purple. I'm Ginn and he's Fake. Hmm.. Thats not right. He's Ginn, and I'm... wait...}}
{{L|Princess Purple patch|I'ma call you Purple Face! You want to come play in my purple place? }}
{{L|[Jake gets reminded of what the water nymph said to him before.]}}
{{L|Water Nymph (Denise)|[echoes, warning] Don't touch the purple stuff!}}
{{L|Jake|[To Finn] Weren't we supposed to not do something with the purple things?}}
{{L|Finn|[confused] Hm?}}
{{L|Princess Purple Patch|Oh, you want purple? Here, take some for the road!}}
{{L|[Princess Purple Patch tosses some purple toward Finn and Jake. Finn and Jake become affected by the purple, and enter a childlike state.]}}
{{L|Princess Purple Patch|[sadly] Oh, dear, I've purpled you.}}
{{L|[They begin to cry and fly away.]}}
{{L|Princess Purple Patch|[sadly] Why do I always do this? }}
{{L|Purple|[casually] Later.}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake continue to play in the purple.]}}
{{L|Jake|[pleasantly] Heh! What a great gal.}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah. [pleasantly] Purple! [confused] Wait- what were we just doing? We were.... We were.... Who are we?}}
{{L|Jake|I don't know, man. [Playing in the purple] But I like these things.}}
{{L|Finn|[Trying to remember.] Foon. I'm--- I'm Foon. [groaning] I'm.. [smiling obliviously] Fine.}}
{{L|[Finn notices Jake grunting on the ground.]}}

{{L|Finn|Huh? Ja-- Ja-- Jaaauump!}}
{{L|[Finn jumps in front of jake]}}
{{L|Finn|Hello. Are you a lost dog? I am boy.}}
{{L|Jake|Uh.. maybe?}}
{{L|Finn|We are boy and dog.}}
{{L|Jake|I'm petting the ground, boy.}}
{{L|Finn|Looks like fun.}}
{{L|[Finn get on the ground and sniffs it.]}}
{{L|Finn|And it smells like toast.}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake notice Bush Boots (Tree Trunks) crying in the distance.]}}
{{L|Finn|Huh? Crying. Long nose. }}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[exclaiming and posing] Investigate!}}
{{L|[Bush Boots continues to cry]}}
{{L|Finn|[speaking to Bush Boots] Miss, your crying indicates you're in need of help.}}
{{L|Bush Boots|What? [sniffles] Yes. I've lost my rolling pin.}}
{{L|Finn|Understood. What's your name, miss?}}
{{L|Bush Boots|I'm Bush Boots, the little apricot anteater [begins to bawl]}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake approach Bush Boots and embrace her.]}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|Hugs!}}
{{L|Bush Boots|[wiping tears] The hugs helped my crying, but it didn't help me find my rolling pin.}}
{{L|Finn|Boy and dog will find your rolling pin. [looking around] Where did you last see it?}}
{{L|Bush Boots|It was rolling around here not too long ago.}}

{{L|[The sea lard rolls across the screen]}}
{{L|Bush Boots|Oh, there it goes!}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake begin to chase it, with bush boots far behind]}}
{{L|Bush Boots|Come back, you bad little rolling pin!}}
{{L|[The sea lard/rolling pin hides in the bushes.]}}
{{L|Finn|Bush Boots, lets sneak up on it.}}
{{L|[They roll toward the sea lard stealthily, and capture it.]}}
{{L|Jake|[wrestling with the sea lard] Am-boosh!}}
{{L|Bush Boots|[happy] Oh, you caught it! Wonderful!}}
{{L|[the next scene is at Bush Boots' home. Bush boots is struggling to hold the "rolling pin".}}
{{L|Bush Boots|[struggling] Come on, now. Just roll the dough.}}
{{L|[The sea lard jumps out of her hands and flops around. Everyone gasps.]}}
{{L|Bush Boots|[sadly, upset] Oh, its getting away again!}}
{{L|Finn|Ma'am, I think that rolling pin is sentient.}}
{{L|Jake|[Agreeing] Yeah, I don't think it wants to be a rolling pin.}}
{{L|Finn|Dog, we have to save that rolling pin from this sweet lady. [Finn looks around] Where did it go?}}
{{L|[The sea lard shows itself, and rolls away. Finn and Jake run after it.]}}
{{L|Finn|[yelling] Rolling pin! We want to help!}}
{{L|[As Finn and Jake run away, Bush Boots' home becomes a train, and rolls away. Finn and Jake can't follow the sea lard's trail.]}}
{{L|Finn|No more.. Slime.}}
{{L|Jake|Rolling pin trail has gone cold.}}

{{L|[A bee (Bee-mo) begins to buzz around them.]}}
{{L|Finn|A bee. }}
{{L|Jake|I see.}}
{{L|Bee|A poem by me. Listen for a sound and look around.}}
{{L|Unless egress is sought, smiles will not be found.}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[confused] Hmm?}}
{{L|Bee|It's a metaphor.}}
{{L|[The bee flies away and Finn and Jake follow it. They approach the pink pond from before.]}}
{{L|Jake|A pink pond.}}
{{L|Finn|Pink pond? Pretty!}}
{{L|Pink pond|[Giggles] Hee hee! Hello, friends!}}
{{L|Jake|The pond has a face and is talking to us.}}
{{L|Finn|[in awe] Yeah.}}
{{L|Pink pond|[inviting] Dive in.}}

{{L|[The pink pond turns into a whirlpool.]}}
{{L|Finn|I don't feel comfortable diving into a face.}}
{{L|[The sea lard approaches from behind them.]}}
{{L|Finn|Dog, lets go back for apricot pie.}}
{{L|Jake|[excited] Yeah, pie!}}
{{L|[The sea lard pushes Finn and Jake into the pool.]}}
{{L|Jake|Gross!}}
{{L|Finn|[exclaiming] Whoaaa, whoa, whoa, whoa!}}
{{L|[The sea lard jumps in after them.]}}

{{L|[Finn and Jake return to normal Ooo, and are inside the treehouse. Ice King is staring through their window. Jake is speaking to BMO]}}
{{L|Jake|And then there was like, a PB puddle, a Marceline plant, and a little bee that looked like you, BMO! You know what? We didn't save the sea lard. The sea lard saved us.}}
{{L|BMO|Yay, sea lard!}}
{{L|Ice King|[on windowsill] Wow, what an adventure.}}
{{L|Jake|[Turns around] And there was even a purple lady kind of like you, Ice King! She even sounded just like you.}}
{{L|Ice King|She sounds magnificent! How'd you say you got there?}}
{{L|Jake|We didn't. Beat it, creep.}}
{{L|Ice King|I'll figure it out.}}
{{L|[Ice King flies away. Finn approaches the window]}}
{{L|Finn|But Simon, if you go there, you'll lose you memories.}}
{{L|Ice King|What memories? I'm like a goldfish over here.}}

{{L|[Ice King looks away]}}
{{L|Jake|[curious] In what way, exactly?}}
{{L|[Ice King notices Jake]}}
{{L|Ice King|Oh, hey Jake. [exclaiming] Where am I?}}
{{L|[The scene changes to nightfall. Finn is putting the sea lard into bed.]}}
{{L|Finn|Comfy, dude? I bet you ran away 'cause we didn't appreciate you and called you gross and stuff. But you're not gross. [Finn kisses the sea lard] Mwah! Goodnight, sea lard.}}
{{L|[the sea lard closes his eyes and begins to sleep.]}}

{{L|[end of episode.]}}
