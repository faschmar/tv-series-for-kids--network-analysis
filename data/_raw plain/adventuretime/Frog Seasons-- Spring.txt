{{L|[''Petals blow through the air, and then fall to the ground. The [[Frog Carrying Crown]] walks past the petals, and the screen pans out to show [[Finn]] and [[Jake]] following him.'']}} 
{{L|Finn| What do you think is gonna happen when he puts it on?}}
{{L|Jake| I don't know but I bet it will be un-frog-gettable.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5nT6O1hYfs&ab_channel=AdventureTime</ref>}}
{{L|Finn| Maybe he'll turn into a prince.}}
{{L|Jake| [''they walk into a field''] Nah, man, you gotta kiss him for that to happen.}}
{{L|Finn| [''[[Breezy (character)|Breezy]] is flying around behind them''] I am NOT kissing that frog.}}
{{L|Breezy| [''holding pollen''] Hey guys!}}
{{L|Jake| Breezy!}}
{{L|Finn| Hey bee, what's up?}}
{{L|Breezy| Not much, I'm just showing [[Bees|the boys]] how to collect pollen.}}
{{L|[''Bees are seen flying around flowers, and trying to collect the pollen.'']}}
{{L|Breezy| [''talking to bees''] You're doing great guys! [''talking to Finn and Jake''] Hey, you want to know what I'm gonna do with this later?}}
{{L|Finn| [''laughing'']}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, we'd love to chat Breezy but see we're following this frog just now so, you know. [''shows the frog walking towards a cornfield'']}}
{{L|Finn| Oh yeah, right!}}
{{L|[''The frog walks into the cornfield.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''walking away from Breezy''] We just really want to see him put on that crown.}}
{{L|Breezy| Yeah, I hear 'ya!}} 
{{L|[''Finn and Jake walk into the cornfield.'']}}
{{L|Breezy| Have fun!}}
{{L|Finn| [''walking out of the cornfield''] Where'd he go?}}
{{L|Jake| [''pointing''] Probably to that [[Water Lily Pad Castle|sweet water lily pad castle]].}}
{{L|Finn| [''shows the castle''] Nice!}}
{{L|[''The frog walks out of the water and into the castle.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Walking through the water''] Jake, there's little [[Tadpoles|tadpoles]] in the water.}}
{{L|Jake| Don't let 'em get up your pants.}}
{{L|Finn| [''approaching the castle''] These shorts are tighter than tadpoles.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake go to the door, which is slightly ajar.'']}}
{{L|Finn| He left the door open! [''Finn fully opens the door'']}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake crawl through the hallway, then look through the window.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''gasps'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''shows the frog in his dressing room''] There he is.}}
{{L|[''The frog puts on a royal red cape.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''looking through the window''] He's gonna put it on!}}
{{L|[''The frog picks up his shoes, exhales on them, and rubs them to make them look shiny.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''shows the frog putting on the shoes''] You're cute enough now!}}
{{L|Finn| [''angrily''] Put on the crown!}}
{{L|[''The frog puts on white silk golves.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''groans, and prepares to walk away''] I can't take it anymore!}}
{{L|Finn| No wait! He's doing it! [''shows the frog picking up the crown and lifting it above his head''] Come one frog! Do it! Do it! Dooo iiittt!}}
{{L|[''[[Frog Guards]] look at Finn and Jake angrily. They scream as the guards open the door.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''frog guard holding Jake's hands behind his back''] Ah, come on! We was just curious! Easy with my piano hands, chief.}}
{{L|Finn| [''frog guards drag him away as the frog is putting on the crown''] Wait, uh, no no no no no no no, NOOOOOO!}}
{{L|[''The frog puts on the crown, and there is a bright flash of light.'']}}
