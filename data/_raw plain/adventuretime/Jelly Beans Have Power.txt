'''Slime Princess''': East coast slime! West coast slime! Booty slime!

[ Laughs ]

And then I was like, "There's aslime and place for everything."

And they were al, "OMG,

you're the greatest slimeelemental ever!"

[ Laughs ]

Too bad you didn't invitePatience St. Pim

to this party celebratingmy new powers.

It's notto celebrate your ‐‐

Wait, Patienceis totally nutcakes!

She kidnapped us and messedwith our molecules.

Uhh, so what?She gave us these groovy powers.

East coast slime!

West coast slime!

Booty Sliiiime!

Stop sliming everything!No one likes it!

Oh, hey, Princess.

We were just wondering where allthis rad slime was coming from.

Keep on slimin' it, SP!

[ Scoffs ]Thanks for nothin'.

Okay, great seeing youand your secretions!

[ Kick! ]I'll call you.

[ Whoosh! ]

Slime and plaaaace!

There's a slime and placefor everything.

[ Grunts ]

[ Pbht! ]

[ Electricity crackles ]

Huh?

Princess?

What are you doing hereso late?

Heyyy, buddy!

Yeah, just doin' somecasual science jazz.

Show me your hand,young lady.

Fine.

I was trying to chartmy candy power

to figure out whyit's so garbage.

[ Pbht! ]

But its garbagenessis uncrackable.

Things were finebefore jellybeans

were farting outof my palms.

Don't give in to nostalgia,Princess.

Now, imagine this plateis an enemy of the kingdom.

You sleep with a plate?

The whole kingdom's lookingat you to beat it.

You're gonna shoot it withstreams of powerful candy,

and it's gonna blowtheir freaking minds.

Okay.

[ Grunting ]

Thanks for tryin', Peps.

I'm gonna call it a night.

[ Wind whistling ]

Brrr!

Huh?

What's this?

Eh, probably just an ad.

[ Yawns ]

Sweetings, Bubgum!

[ Squishing ]

Oh, this floor is stickierthan it looks.

Did someone lick this?

Um, who are you?

No, I'm Chatsberry ‐‐the candy.

You're an older versionof the candy elemental.

Exactly!

Did you feel that knowledgein your cosmic consciousness?

Nah.I just guessed.

Oh. But why aren't you usingyour powers?

This power stinks, man.There's nothing to it.

There's everything to it!

Candy's one of the buildingblocks of life.

It's in our very DNA.

Take this soft drink,for example.

Add some Scotch mints to it,and behold!

Hey, how did you do that?

I can barely shootone jellybean.

Here, let me show you.

Connect to yourself.

I am connected to myself.

Not to the selfyou once were,

to your new self.

[ Crying ]

[ Alarm rings ]

[ Zing! Alarm stops ]

I'll be globbed!

Okay.

Now aim and, jellybean!

Pow!Milk ball!

Pow!Candy corn!

Pow!

Those were all jellybeansbut still, really good.

Call Slime Princess!

[ Laughs ]

And everyone was cheeringso much for me.

I was like,"Applaud quieter."

[ Laughs ]

Say, how about some sugarfor your tea?

Uh yeah, sure.

Allow me.

By the beardof Elder Plops!

This is cool, but...

[ Straining ]I said, allow...me!

[ Gasps ]You're welcome.

Okay, we've establishedwe both have elemental powers.

So we never have to talk or bragabout them again.

Brag? Wait, are you jellyof my slime?

Your slime is overrated.

I guess your real elementalpower is envy!

Bye, hater!

[ Teacups clatter ]

I don't think this isreally about slime.

Maybe.

It's just thatthe candy kingdom's

supposed to be a reflectionof me.

But it turns out,I don't know who that is.

I've lived my whole life

while having this talentI knew nothing about.

I'm a scientist

and I ignored crucial dataabout myself.

What if I ‐‐

[ Alarm buzzing ]

Wait! We were so closeto a breakthrough!

I don't have timefor breakthroughs.

♪♪

[ Gasps ]

Run, Skibbles!

All: Princess Bubblegum!Princess Bubblegum!

[ Screaming ]

You see what I mean?

This is what I haveto deal with.

Hup!

Hey, Crystal Entity!

Kindly state your businessbefore the Princess!

Pick a number.

This is some weak first‐gradermagician we're dealing with.

Only a real idiot would fallfor this guy.

Four!

Yeah, four!

[ All chanting "Four" ]

Guys!

One, two, three, four.

[ All gasping ]

[ Screaming ]

No!

Hurray forPrincess Bubblegum!

Hurray for Bubblegum!

Heck yeah!

[ Cheering ]

Come on, Peps.

Ka‐kaw!

[ Whoosh! ]

[ Cheering ]

So majestic!

Pick a number.

How about a billion jellybeansin your face!

Uh‐oh.

[ Slow‐motion screaming ]

Oh, shoot.

Try a morepowerful attack.

Do a gobstopper.

[ Grunts ]

That's just more beans!

[ Grunting ]

[ Pop! ]

[ Clang! ]

Okay, those were stilljellybeans.

[ Screaming ]

[ Groans ]

Hey, that's ‐‐ that'sthe thing.

Whoa!

Sweetings, Bubblegum.

Chatsberry!Great timing!

Poke my brain again and unlockthat mint‐soda explosion.

[ Slurps ]

I can open the doorfor you,

but you have to stepthrough it yourself,

and walk in your own shoes.

I mean,choose your own path.

My kingdom is under attack!

[ Slurps ]

You're as uselessas my stinkin' powers.

[ Grunts ]

Four, five,six, seven, eight.

I had a path!

My path was sciencebecause science makes sense!

[ Groans ]If I was in my lab,

I could fabricate that explosionin a snap.

What explosion?

It was just regular soda popand Scotch mints.

That shouldn't be hard.It's all sugar, right?

Right.

To make soda pop,

I'd need to add waterand carbon dioxide.

And for the mints, gum Arabic,

gelatin, potassium benzoate.

Add heat and pressure...

[ Ting! ]

I did it!

Chatsberry, I'm walkingin my own shoes!

What?

Look!

[ Cheering ]

You're doing it!

You're blowingtheir freaking minds!

Now let's blow his mind.

Finishing move!

Ha ha, yes!

So cold.

Oh, no.

[ Both scream ]

No more boom!

It's just soda.

I'm not gonna...

I'm sorry.

[ All moaning ]

Banana guards, get the woundedto the infirmary!

I'll be in my quartersif, uh, if anyone needs me.

Okay. Hang on now.

Don't forgetmy jelly filling!

Oh, my goodness.

[ Banana guard imitatessiren wailing ]

[ Laughing ]

[ Gobbling ]

Yee!Stop that now!

That crystal stuffwill grind your guts!

Huh?

Wait, it's just snow?

[ Sighs ]

[ Zing! ]

Ow!

[ Sighs ]

[ Whistling ]

[ Smooches ]

[ Whistling continues ]

Man: Hey, will youkeep it down down there!

Some of us haveto work tomorrow!
