{{L|[''The episode begins with [[Jake]] humming contentedly while frying an egg. [[Finn]] enters the scene and Jake begins to beatbox. Finn begins to dance and add vocals to Jake's beatboxing.'']}}
{{L|Finn and Jake [''In unison'']| Yeeeaaah!}}
{{L|Finn| What's for B-fast, Jake?}}
{{L|Jake| [[Everything burrito]]! [''Finn gasps and Jake begins wrapping the burrito.''] [''Whispering''] I love you, everything burrito. [''He kisses the burrito. Suddenly, there's a loud noise and the room momentarily quakes. Finn and Jake go downstairs to investigate.''] Oh, man. I think someone wants to eat everything burrito! I won't let 'em get ya, baby! [''Kisses the burrito once more'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake! Come on! Get ready!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Sets the burrito down''] Ready!}}
{{L|Finn and Jake [''In unison'']| Yaaaaah!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake leap outside and discover the [[Cuties]].'']}}
{{L|[[Cute King]]| Peep!}}
{{L|Jake| So cute!}}
{{L|Finn| Look at their little faces! Haha!}}
{{L|Jake| Haha!}}
{{L|Cute King| We're not cute! We're evil, ...and we're here to dominate ''you''!}}
{{L|Finn| Get the camera, Jake!}}
{{L|Jake| I can't! I'm paralyzed by the cuteness!}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| [[BMO]]! BMO! BMO! BMO!}}
{{L|[''BMO enters and pushes Finn and Jake aside.'']}}
{{L|BMO| What? What? What? What?}}
{{L|Finn and Jake [''In unison'']| BMO! Get the camera!}}
{{L|BMO| BMO ''is'' camera!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake begin taking pictures with the Cuties, and Cute King gets increasingly annoyed.'']}}
{{L|Cute King| Enough! Now... bow down to me, Cute King, and my legion of Cuties!}}
{{L|[''BMO takes another picture.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Great shot, BMO!}}
{{L|Cute King| Since you won't take us seriously, we will kill you. Until then, enjoy your burrito, Jake.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Suddenly worried''] Huh?}}
{{L|[''Cute King chuckles and the Cuties walk away. Jake, inside the fort, gasps, and Finn and BMO run next to the door.'']}}
{{L|Jake| My burrito!}}
{{L|Finn| It's perfectly fine.}}
{{L|Jake| No, Finn... They probably ''poisoned'' it!}}
{{L|Finn| Naaaaawww...}}
{{L|Jake| They knew my name. They knew about the burrito.}}
{{L|Finn| Man, you're letting your brain dial turn your fear volume up. You'll see. Those Cuties are nothing but an afternoon's delight.}}
{{L|[''Scene switches to nighttime. Finn looks at Jake out the window. Jake is holding a shovel and standing next to his burrito's grave. Finn walks to his bed and yawns; he gets under the covers. Suddenly, Jake enters.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake? What're you doing in my bed?}}
{{L|Jake| [''somewhat worried''] Oh, nothing much. You know, just... chillin'.}}
{{L|Finn| Wait a second... Are you still messed up about those little guys?}}
{{L|Jake| [''Beat''] A little.}}
{{L|Finn| Look, man, whaddaya say tomorrow morning we go track those little guys down and find out just what their deal is? Sound good, buddy?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah. Thanks, buddy. [''Finn rests. Jake thinks for a moment.''] Man, you sound just like [[Margaret|Mom]] sometimes.}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah. Good ol' Mom.}}
{{L|Jake| She always knew just what to say.}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah. Goodnight, brudda.}}
{{L|Jake| Goodnight. [''Fade to black. Suddenly, Jake whispers to Finn in a worried tone.''] Finn! Finn! [''We see Finn's point of view as he opens his eyes.''] Finn, wake up, man!}}
{{L|Finn| Wha? Huh?}}
{{L|Jake| I think someone's in the house. [''Finn makes a tired groaning noise as he lights a candle.''] For real, man! Shh, listen.}}
{{L|Finn| Uh...}}
{{L|Jake| I swear, man! I really heard something. [''Footsteps are heard, and Jake gasps.''] Finn!!}}
{{L|Finn| I heard. [''Raising his voice''] Okay. Who's out there?}}
{{L|[''Finn shines the candle across the room and eventually spots two Cuties carrying [[Jake's sword]], who drop it and quickly crawl away.'']}}
{{L|Jake| What the—?! That's my sword! [''Picks it up''] What do they want with my sword, man?! [''Finn makes a worried face. There is a sudden noise downstairs.''] [''Whispering''] It came from downstairs.}}
{{L|Finn| Alright. That's it.}}
{{L|Jake| Where are you going?}}
{{L|Finn| I'm gonna go man-handle those guys's banandles! [''Goes downstairs'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Beat''] ...What?! [''He follows.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Well, they broke a window, but I don't see any of 'em. [''Picks up a shard from the ground''] I guess they left. [''Throws it back down again'']}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, no. OH, AWWW, NO!}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, what is it?!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Drops his sword''] Awww, no! It's a dead goat, man! Its guts are all over the place! It's all chopped up and spread around and... [''Looks closer''] Ah, no, wait, it's just a blanket. I think I left it here this morning.}}
{{L|Voice| Jaaaake! Fiiiinn! This is the voice of your moooom! I've come back to tell you how dumb you always aaaare! [''Voice is revealed to belong to a Cutie''] I hate you guys so muuuuch!}}
{{L|Finn| Get 'im, Jake!}}
{{L|Jake| Aaah! Aaah!}}
{{L|[''The Cutie hisses, making Jake shrink back in terror. Finn chases the Cutie, and it hides in a knothole; Finn grabs it and it starts struggling.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, I got 'im! He's freakin' out, man! What do I do?!}}
{{L|Jake| Shake 'im!}}
{{L|Finn| What?!}}
{{L|Jake| Shake 'im around 'til he stops!}}
{{L|Finn| Okay. [''He does so.''] Rrrrrrr! [''The Cutie gets tired out.''] They stopped.}}
{{L|Jake| Okay. Now tell 'im not to talk about our mom!}}
{{L|Finn| How do you even know our mom?}}
{{L|Cutie's first head| We've been watching you.}}
{{L|Cutie's second head| Learning your weaknesses.}}
{{L|Finn| What?! Why?!}}
{{L|Cutie's first head| For tomorrow morning.}}
{{L|Cutie's second head| When our army comes and kills you both.}}
{{L|Cutie's first head| You think we're so cute, when actually... we're the opposite of that!! [''Bites Finn's hand'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hold 'im!}}
{{L|[''Finn tries to keep a grip on the Cutie, but its arm is accidentally yanked off, allowing it to escape with a cackling laugh. Finn holds up the dismembered appendage.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, gross. [''tosses it away'']}}
{{L|Jake| Well?! Do you believe me ''now'', Finn?!}}
{{L|Finn| I... I don't know ''what'' to believe anymore.}}
{{L|Jake| Well, that's close enough. Let's start settin' up some barricades!}}
{{L|[''Scene switches to the following day. Finn and Jake are sitting behind their barricade holding weapons. Finn is asleep and Jake is anxiously waiting. Suddenly, a bugle in E is heard, and Finn wakes up with a start, accidentally firing an arrow from his [[Finn's crossbows|crossbow]]. Finn and Jake look out the window to find the cuties charging forward.'']}}
{{L|Jake| There's gotta be a ''thousand'' of 'em!}}
{{L|Finn| Wait. Jake, look.}}
{{L|[''The Cuties begin tripping over themselves, falling apart, and exploding (among other things) until there are none left.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Not scared anymore''] These guys aren't a threat to ''anyone''.}}
{{L|Finn| These guys are a threat to ''themselves''.}}
{{L|[''One Cutie accidentally harms another, and Finn and Jake wince.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, hey, it's what's-his-face!}}
{{L|Cute King|<nowiki> No... My men! Quickly, men! Pick yourselves up before the enemy sees! [</nowiki>''Finn and Jake look at each other.''<nowiki>] Come on, now. That's it. Easy does it. [</nowiki>''Cute King takes his injured soldiers away and Finn and Jake sneak after them.''<nowiki>] Bravest warriors! I ask you: must we have our butts handed to us by everyone we meet?! How will we </nowiki>''ever'' splash around in the brains of our enemies if you guys can't take two steps without exploding?! [[Bliblob]]<nowiki>, I'm lookin' at you! [</nowiki>''Bliblob explodes.''<nowiki>] Can I </nowiki>''please'' just get ''one''<nowiki> victory?! ONCE?! [</nowiki>''The Cuties begin to cry.''<nowiki>] Now don't start that. [</nowiki>''Saddened''<nowiki>] Don't you do it! [</nowiki>''The Cuties burst into tears. Cute King tries to contain himself before joining them.''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}
{{L|Jake| Wanna just smash 'em all?}}
{{L|Finn| What?! No, man, look. These guys aren't gonna quit until they win or die, ...and they're ''not'' gonna win, so what if we ''let'' 'em win, just this once?}}
{{L|Jake| What?! And mess up my stats?!}}
{{L|Finn| No. We'd be winning by helping ''them'' to win. That's a win! [''Jake scowls at Finn's logic.''] And then they'll be happy and leave us alone.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Reluctantly''] Alright.}}
{{L|Finn| Yessss! Now, let's rally an army so we can look intimidating.}}
{{L|Jake| Who're we gonna call?}}
{{L|Finn| All of our friends.}}
{{L|[''Scene switches to the "battlefield." Jake, [[Lumpy Space Princess]], [[Birds#Duck_in_Conquest_of_Cuteness|a duck]], BMO, and [[Cinnamon Bun]] are all lined up in front of Finn.'']}}
{{L|Finn| My army of friends! Today, we will lose this battle, but we will also win it! [''They cheer.''] When the enemy charges, crumble like a cookie. When you feel their puny punches, fade like a flower, and writhe in your own blood!}}
{{L|BMO| But, but... how are we to bleed if none of this is real?}}
{{L|Finn| With faith, m'lady... and ketchup!}}
{{L|[''They cheer again.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Ketchup is delicious and deceiving!}}
{{L|Finn| And hey, guys... Let's keep the acting subtle. Less is more.}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| No way. First, I'm gonna fall in love with one of those little guys, and then I'm gonna fall ''out'' of love, and then, I'm gonna totally fake-die of a fake heart attack! [''Acting''] "OH! MY HEART! MY HEART HURTS BECAUSE I FELL OUT OF LOVE! AND NOW I HAVE TO DIE! OOOOHHHHH!!!"}}
{{L|[''Bugle sounds again. The Cuties charge.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Get ready, y'all. Together, we ''fall''!}}
{{L|[''Cinnamon Bun falls over.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Not yet, Cinnamon Bun!}}
{{L|[''Cute King charges in a giant suit of his men.'']}}
{{L|Cute King| YAAAAH!}}
{{L|Finn, Jake, Lumpy Space Princess, and BMO [''In unison'']| Whoa.}}
{{L|[''The suit is revealed to be incredibly small. The Cuties punch Finn.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, no! [''Squirts ketchup''] My blooood! [''Waves the bottle at the others, covering them in ketchup. The "battle" rages on.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| [''Holding a Cutie''] One last kiss before dying, my love. [''Kisses the Cutie's face and throws the Cutie to the ground''] Farewell forever. Oh, oh, my heart! Waaah! [''Feigns death'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Falls over and feigns death''] I'm dead.}}
{{L|Cute King| Victory... is... OURS! [''The Cuties cheer.''] Finally. I can do the victory dance! [''Starts dancing''] La! La-da! La-da-da la! La-da-da la da! [''Jake begins quietly snickering.''] La-la-da-la-la-la! [''Cute King notices Jake's snickering.'']}}
{{L|Jake| BAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Ah, I'm sorry, everybody! Ah, I couldn't keep it in! Hahahaha!}}
{{L|Cute King| No... [''Tastes the ketchup''] This is ketchup?!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Licks some off his fur''] Tastes better than blood. Or ''does'' it? Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup?}}
{{L|Finn| Jake. Look. [''Points at Cute King, who is walking away and crying quietly.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Aw, nuts.}}
{{L|Finn| Cute King, wait up.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Shrinks down to Cute King's size''] We wanna apologize for being fakers.}}
{{L|Finn| We did it to protect you from yourselves.}}
{{L|Cute King| It doesn't matter now. No one will ''ever'' fear our strength.}}
{{L|Finn| But ''strength'' isn't your strength. Adorable cuteness is!}}
{{L|Cute King| Can I use it to control others?}}
{{L|Finn| Um... yeah, sure! Just be righteous about it.}}
{{L|Cute King| Show me where to start.}}
{{L|[''Scene switches to the [[Ice Kingdom]]. [[Ice King]], inside his lair, is just lying on his back making fart noises. A knock is heard.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| Huh? Who could ''that'' be? [''Opens the door and looks down'']}}
{{L|Cute King| I command you to make me a sandwich!}}
{{L|Ice King| What?! No one commands the Ice King to make no sandwich!}}
{{L|Cute King| [''Makes a cute pose''] What about ''now''?}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Gasps then laughs''] Okay.}}
{{L|[''The episode ends with Ice King laughing playfully and Cute King laughing deviously before a camera flash ends the scene.'']}}
