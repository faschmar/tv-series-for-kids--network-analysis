Whoops!

Look what treasuresthe low tide has revealed.

Oh, Glob, my door.

I don't know.

This place is kind ofa bust, man.

We're investigatingearly human culture.

We'll probably find all kindsof cursed artifacts.

Hmm, it has been a while sinceI had a good hex put on me.

Oh, yeah, pretty spooky.

[ Snake hisses ]Someone could definitelyget cursed in here,

and I hope it's me!

Susan: Look.

Art facts.


Whoa. It's the bonesof a prehistoric horse.

They were totally coveredin feathers,

and they used their polesto sting people

who triedto steal their honey.

Horse honey?Pshh!

You said there'd be hexesand sup‐‐

[ Squeak! ]A demon!

Oh, nah.It's just a little cutie.

[ Grunts ]Huh?

Come to me, angry demons!

Teach me a dark lesson.

I thinkit's an ooo‐quake!

Hey, bozos, it's me.

Cyber‐Tiffany!

Come with me, and I'll explainalmost everything.


Woman:Welcome, new flesh.

Pretty nice, huh?

I mean, I came straightfrom a worm queen's intestines,

so I'm biased.

I was like a crazedvermilion crab

limping alongthe sea floor.

How'd you getthat sick bionic arm?

Oh, this old thing?It was a gift from the doctor.

The doctor?

Later, Jake.Later.

‐But how did you ‐‐‐Cyber shush, Finn!

Wait for the reveal.

Well, I think bionic armsare cool, don't you, Susan?

‐Bravo!‐Bravo!

This zoo's amazing.

You got any normal animalslike hummingbirds or bats?

This isn't a zoo,zoo nerd.

It's a menagerie.‐That's quite all right.

We don't have any non‐hybridanimals here, Finn.

And even if we did,they'd probably die...

of envy.

[ Laughter ]

[ Tapping on glass ]

What's this guy's deal?

That's a scorp‐munk.

[ Chuckles ]Look at you go, girl.

Hmm, it's almost like he'strying to tell me something.Sweet granny!

Please take a seat.

You've all beensuch super guests, so...

lollipops for everyone!

‐Yay!‐Yay!‐Yay!

But Finn told Susan not to takecandy from strangers.

A stranger's just a friend youhaven't taken candy from yet.

Well said. So, eat them quick,and let's get this show started.

You're going to show me ifyou're right for my "process."

Just got to get more"comfortable" first.

Uh, I liked it betterwhen you were singing songs.

Oh, yeah,that feels better.

Sometimes I just got to get outof this hot STIM suit.

It's so stuffy.‐You're human?!

I thought I was the last one.

Well, me and Martin.And Betty.

And sometimes Ice King?

Yeah, and I still havequestions about Susan.

Actually, human plus.

[ Whirring ]

Mods.

Humans have relied on modsfor thousands of years.

Glasses to let us see better,

artificial heartsto replace bum tickers,

and the next logical step ‐‐

scissor handsand telescopic spider legs.

And the longer you work for me,the more mods you'll earn.

It's likean incentive program.

It's a great program.

Cool, huh?

Sure, mods are cool,

but check outmy stretching powers, Dr. G.

100% natchy.

[ Squeak, thwack ]

Jake!

I can't movemy limbs/torso!

Dr. Gross, help!

Uh‐oh.

Susan's stuck, too.

Oh, you put the paralyzingjuice in the candy.

My boss is so smart.

Yes, yes.Now, let's get to work.

Assistants!

Wolf‐lards!

They got the high enduranceof a sea lard combined with

the bloodthirsty killerinstincts of a sea lard.

Is this still partof the tour?

What are you doing,Dr. Gross?

They used to ask me that allthe time back at the island.

"What are you doing,Dr. Gross?

You'll never get awaywith this."

Lady, you are sick!

[ Scoffs ]

None of you normies knowwhat you want.

So it's up to meand my hybrid army to drag

all the other humansinto a golden age.

Wait, other humans?

There are more humans?!

Let's get you prepped.

[ Razor buzzing ]
