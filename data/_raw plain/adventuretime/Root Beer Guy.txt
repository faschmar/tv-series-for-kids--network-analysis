{{L|[''[[Candy People]] murmur worryingly.'']}}
{{L|[''Finn tickles the ogre's nose, and he starts laughing, causing candy people to come out of his mouth. Then the Candy People start cheering.'']}}
{{L|[[Candy Person 28|Root Beer Guy]]|Wow, that was really something.}}
{{L|[''Root Beer Guy uses his card to get in his workplace then he looks back to see Finn & Jake chasing the ogre with swords.'']}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|Really something.}}
{{L|[''Root Beer Guy enters his workplace.'']}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|Sure, I'll hold. Hello? I'd like to take a few minutes of your time to tell you about an amazing vitamin supplement. But first, just let me ask you: do you ever feel that no matter what you eat, you're still tired and sluggish and... filled with nagging anxiety and doubt... and...?}}
{{L|[''Root Beer Guy's boss snaps his finger at Root Beer Guy'']}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy's boss|Root Beer guy, get your head back in the game!}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy| Hello, ma'am, I'd like to take a few minutes of your time... hello?}}
{{L|Chocolate Bar|What we need is to cut out the middle man.}}
{{L|Gumdrop Guy|Hey, Root Beer Guy}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|Hey.}}
{{L|Gumdrop Guy|Dude, we should start our own place.}}
{{L|[''Root Beer Guy is walking in the train station. He opens a comic book in the train.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Next stop, Lollipop Park Estates.}}
{{L|[''Root Beer guy walks down the street and appears in the house eating.'']}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|This is good. What is this?}}
{{L|[[Cherry Cream Soda]]|Candy...}}
{{L|[''In the bedroom'']}}
{{L|Cherry Cream Soda|[''yawns''] I've got a closing argument tomorrow, Root Beer Guy.}}
{{L|[''Root Beer Guy closes his book and places it to the side and switches off the night light. He gets off the bed and takes out a typewriter. He then brings the typewriter to the kitchen'']}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|I knew there was trouble. I could smell it on the hot evening breeze. Fortunately for me, trouble is my favorite thing because I'm Joe Milkshake. I kicked down the door with one swift, decisive motion... No... With one swift and decisive motion, I kicked down the door... No... The door was kicked down by me swiftly with not many motions, but a whole lot of decisiveness was used by me that was apparent to everybody... oh.}}
{{L|[''His cat points at the door to Root Beer Guy. Root Beer Guy opens the door and hears a scream.'']}}
{{L|[[Princess Bubblegum]]|What are you doing? Let me go! No!}}
{{L|[''Finn throws Princess Bubblegum into a chest and Jake closes it and they both high-five each other.'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|Yeah.}}
{{L|[''Jake changes shape to a truck and Finn places the chest at the boot. Finn gets into the truck and they drive away. Root Beer Guy rubs his eyes and goes back to bed.'']}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|Hey, hey, are you awake?}}
{{L|Cherry Cream Soda|Not really.}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|Well, this is going to sound crazy, but I think I saw Princess Bubblegum get kidnapped and the perpetrators were that Finn and Jake!}}
{{L|Cherry Cream Soda|Okay, sweetie, that sounds like an interesting dream.}}
{{L|[''Cherry Cream Soda goes back to sleep.'']}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|But it did happen.}}
{{L|Cherry Cream Soda|You need to eat something before you go to work. And you can't keep falling asleep at your typewriter; it's bad for your back. Besides, I miss you at night.}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|I'm sorry, sweetie. I couldn't stop thinking about that weird stuff I saw last night when I was peeking through the bushes.}}
{{L|Cherry Cream Soda|Peeking through the bushes?! You've been warping your mind with all this mystery stuff. I swear, sometimes I think you love that novel of yours more than you love me. You've been working on it every night for ten years and for WHAT? Look at me, Root Beer Guy. I'm a Cherry Cream Soda and I have the same needs as any other Cherry Cream Soda! Or even diet cream soda.}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|I didn't know what to say, but Joe Milkshake never was a talky guy. On my way to work that morning, I decided to take a second look at the crime scene.}}
{{L|[''Root Beer Guy looks up at the 'BG CCTV' sign and then looks up at the CCTV. He walks towards a pit with a 'Lake Butterscotch' matchbook and picks it up. He then hears voices of his boss and then the scene moves back to his workplace.'']}}

{{L|Root Beer Guy|Zero?}}
{{L|Boss|Great, you can count to zero.}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|You know, maybe if you give me the new lead...}}
{{L|Boss|Hmph, you haven't earned the new leads.}}
{{L|[''As the boss walks away, Root Beer Guy turns his head to see Finn and Jake at the window. He runs out of the workplace.'']}}
{{L|Chocolate Bar|It's easier to do it when you have all the leads.}}
{{L|Gumdrop Guy|Exactly.}}
{{L|Chocolate Bar|Hey, Root Beer Guy.}}
{{L|Gumdrop Guy|It's all about the leads.}}
{{L|Finn|See? I told you, it's candy stucco. Stucco feels great.}}
{{L|Jake|Mmm, when you're right you're right.}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|Alright, you two, what were you doing last night with Princess Bubblegum?}}
{{L|Jake|Um, we were at home last night.}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, we were doing that... thing.}}
{{L|Jake|That was a great thing we were doing at home with no other witnesses.}}
{{L|Finn|But we're each other's witnesses.}}

{{L|Root Beer Guy|Um, look what I got! This security tape will show that Finn and Jake kidnapped Princess Bubblegum.}}
{{L|Cherry Cream Soda|Finn and Jake would never do that!}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|Oh, yeah? Prepare to have your mind blown! After I put this tape in the VCR just to make sure I got the right one. I'm pretty sure I did!}}

{{L|Buck Pudding|Well, let's see. A shovel, a saw, some plastic bags, some duct tape, a bludgeon, a mop, rubber glove.}}
{{L|Root Beer Guy|Say, Mister Buck, do you know anything about this Lake Butterscotch?}}
{{L|Buck Pudding|A right nice spot, Lake Butterscotch. Miles from where anyone can hear a person scream... if a person was screaming for some reason. Creepy now that I think about it. Nothing up there these days but some abandoned caverns. Nice place to hide a body if you're into that sort of thing.}}
