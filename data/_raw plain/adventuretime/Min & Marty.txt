Seems like you're leading ussomewhere.

We're taking a shipto Founders Island,

because judging by the stateof these facilities,

Hub Island has been abandonedfor over a decade.

This island is where I trainedto be a Seeker.

So, wait, why are we goingto Founders Island?

I'm taking you backto your mom.

BMO, would you talkto this console?

I can't access itwithout my implant.

Um...you knew my mom?

You're gonna just drop that?!

Her name is Minerva.

She's a Helper.

[ Ding ]Oh, thanks, BMO.
