Good evening, ma'am.

I just now heard thata bunch of vampires

came back to ‐‐ ooh!

I am the guywho hunts those guys.

Show me all your vampires.

All the vampires got wiped out,like, six months ago.

It's just downto me again.

Really?


I apologizefor the intrusion.

Actually, I'm really gladyou're here.

Hey, BMO,don't leave yet!

I need your helpwith something technical.


Have a sit.


Ta‐da!It's an old USB drive.

I found it in the attic,and I've been trying

to access it for weeksusing my old hardware.

It's funny, but I can't evenremember what's on it.

Hmm.

I don't know,

maybe you'llhave more luck,

Mr. Vampire Hunter.

I also huntdata recovery!


Scanning...

[ USB drive humming,beeping ]


It's goingto be a while.

A while, huh?

Let's use this opportunityto catch up.

I love ketchup!Did you make it yourself?

[ Laughs ]

BMO, no.

I mean how was your boat tripwith Finn and Jake?!

Hmm...


Well,once we left Ooo...

we sailed for 100 days...

until we landedupon a small island.


We were so tired from sailing,we decided to take a nap.

Then the island started shakingand rising from the water.

We were really sleepingon a big cat

with legs on his backso he could walk upside down.

What's going on here?

He said his name was Ted.

My name is Ted.

Whoaaaaaaaa!

A big blue jaywas making noise nearby.

Whoaaaa!

So we walked somewhere else.

Whoa!Oh!

Whoa!Whoa!

We saw some boatsin the clouds.

Finn sang a song,even though he was asleep.

♪ I want to ride ona boat, boat, boat ♪

♪ I want to ride ona goat, goat, goat ♪

♪ Middle C is my favoritenote, note, note ♪

♪ I'm on a catthat floats, floats, floats ♪

Then we floatedwith the boats ‐‐

not in the boats,but with the boats.

And we disappearedinto the clouds.


That's how I remember it,

though I mighthave embellished.

So, what did you dowhile i was on my trip?

Huh?

That was awesome,BMO.

What are you making?

Puppets!

Oh, my blogs!

You are going to catch me upwith a puppet story?

Yup!You gave me the idea!

I'm so happyright now!


I'll try to make itinteresting ‐‐ the BMO way.


Once there was this...

lollipop girl.

Princess Bubblegum?

So there wasthis lollipop girl.

She was really sweet...

and really smart.

Her best friend was...

rock star girl.

[ Guitar strums ]

'Nuff said.

They were pretty different,

but they grokked each other.

They lived ona giant birthday cake

called Weekend City,where clocks were illegal

and everyonewas chill as heck.

[ Horn toots ]Ha ha! Hey!

Ha ha!Hey!

♪ You don't need a pillto be chill ♪

♪ Just have a dill pickle ♪

♪ Go get tickled ♪

♪ And do not kill ♪

Hey, my page!

♪ I'm gonna go pee ♪

♪ Sorry ♪


But one day, a mysterious,cold fart

brought the evil blue tranchinto town.

Ha‐ha!

Hey, there!

Hi. You seem like you'd be intofulfilling

your evolutionary potentialby becoming a potato‐head.

Am I rightor am I right?

Remember that clocks wereillegal in Weekend City.

Well,today's your lucky day...

'cause I'm offeringthis magic fertilizer.

Whoo!

Marceline: Lollipop girlturned her down cold.

[ Growls ] I'll never getthese normies

to understandwhat they're missing.

To be pure potato.

Pure tato.

Marceline: And so, unwillingto give up her bad plan...

[ Laughing ]

Marceline: The blue tranchcrop‐dusted the whole town,[ Cloud farts ]

turning everyoneinto potato‐heads!

[ Coughing ]


Huh?[ Sniffs ]

Ew![ Screams ]

Marceline: But lollipop girlgot it the worst.

Her potato was growing potatoeson potatoes.

She was turning into a full‐onpotato‐stack ‐‐

and I mean crazy tall.

How tall?

Mmm...12 giants tall.

Oh! That is even tallerthan when PB got tall.

[ Clears throat ]

Anyways...

Rock star girl was tough.

She fought back the curse.

♪♪


She promised lollipop girlshe would save her.


She travelled all the wayto Potato Town

to confront the blue tranch.

[ Screams ]

♪ Hey, Blue TranchI'll give you one chance ♪

♪ To fix my friendOr I'll kick your pants ♪

♪ La la la lala la la la ♪

Stop!

I have migraines!


It turned outthe blue tranch's head

was too denseto appreciate good music.

So rock star girl kickedher pants with songs.

♪ Kicks, kicks, kicksTake that and take this ♪

Until, finally,the tranch gave up the antidote.

There!Are you happy now?!


Yes!You go, rock star girl!

But now it gets sad.

Oh, no.Why?

Well...

Rock star girlwasn't really sure

if the blue tranch gave herthe real antidote...

or if it was just a trickto get rid of her.

But the potato cursehad started to spread faster,

so it was kindof her only shot.


Rock star girl used her lastbit of strength

to climb the potato stalk.

But when she finally reachedthe top, she discovered...

[ Gasps ]

That lollipop girl

was a completelydifferent person.

Ha, ha!No!

Rock star girlwas heart‐broken.

All she'd wanted was to haveher best friend back,

but she was gone.

As the potato curse consumedher final thoughts,

she decided toembrace her fate...

to ‐‐ to explodeinto stardust!

[ Strums guitar ]


The end.

What?!Okay.

But she was you,right?

If that's howyou interpreted it.

That ending...

was not believable.

Come on. You had a catwith legs on its back.

I was being emotionallytruthful.

Fine.I sort of copped out.

I guess I just got some stuffthat's harder to talk about.

Maybe 'cause I never actuallytalked about it for real ‐‐

not even to myself.

[ Bell dings ]

Pancakes are ready!

Oh.

[ Whirs ]

Burp.

So what's onthe drive?

I will show you.

♪♪


[ Gasps ]BMO, pause slide show!


Mom.


Marceline?

Who's the nice ladyand the little girl?

It's um...

I don't know, Beems.

Why don't you tell mea story

about the little girland the nice lady.

Okay!

Once there was a ladywho lived in the moon.


She was called Moon Lady,and she could only come out

during lunar eclipses.

Once there was a little girlplaying alone by the sea.

"Hello,little girl."

"Who are you?"

"I'm the moon lady,"said the Moon Lady.

They became best friends.


They swam inthe dirty ocean water,

rolled down a hillon a giant beach ball,

played"can you catch me?"

And rode horsesor something.

They had so much fun.

But, soon, the eclipsestarted to vanish...

and the moon ladyhad to say good‐bye...

because eclipsescan't last forever.

But the little girlnever forgot the moon lady.


Or their friendship.

I think I've hearda story like that...

a long,long time ago.

[ Sniffles ]

That was beautiful,BMO.

Well,it's a beautiful picture.

The end.
<br />
