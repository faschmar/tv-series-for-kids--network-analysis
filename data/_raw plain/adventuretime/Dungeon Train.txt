{{L|[''The episode begins with [[Finn]] and [[Jake]] walking down a path in a forest.'']}}
{{L|Finn|What... is the meaning of "soup"?}}
{{L|Jake|What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest—?}}
{{L|Finn|What... is the meaning of "spoon"?}}
{{L|Jake|Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about [[Flame Princess]]? Y'know, it's okay if you are.}}
{{L|Finn|Naw, that's all fine. I just been feeling kind of... gray, is all. Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately. Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y'know?}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, Finn, girls is like horses. When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again—on a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea. A lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned.}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, I-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle.}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, man, yeah!}}
{{L|Finn|Or, like, if you mess up, you could get really hurt forever, or hurt someone you really care about.}}
{{L|Jake|Eh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as [[Flambo]]'s [[Flambo's Brother|brother]] says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the—[''stops walking''] Whoa! What?!}}
{{L|[''He walks up to a train, which is passing by on its tracks.'']}}
{{L|Jake|What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way!}}
{{L|Finn|Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really.}}
{{L|Jake|Oh, yeah.}}
{{L|[''Finn is now sleeping on the ground.'']}}
{{L|Jake|It's two hours later now. What the stunk? [''[[Stretchy Powers|stretches]] up above the train, seeing that the train is going around in a circular track''] Oh, okay. [''stretches back down''] Hey, the train just goes in a big circle! We can cut right through the middle, blingle, blongle, blungle! Come on! [''grabs Finn and stretches them onto the train''] Wha-hey! You know, I just had another idea! If we just stay put here on the train, we could ride it all the way to the cave. [''a door opens behind them''] Blingle, blongle, blungle!}}
{{L|[''A creature comes running toward them screaming.'']}}
{{L|Creature|Gimme! Gimme the loot! [''hits Finn's head'']}}
{{L|Finn|Ow!}}
{{L|[''The creature stomps on Finn's toes.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Yeeow!}}
{{L|Creature|Gimme! Gimme that hat! [''grabs Finn's hat'']}}
{{L|Finn|Knock it off! [''punches him in the chest and bites his arm'']}}
{{L|Creature|Aah!}}
{{L|[''Finn pushes him off the train.'']}}
{{L|Creature|Oh, dang!}}
{{L|Finn|[''laughs'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, Finn!}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa!}}
{{L|Jake|Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt!}}
{{L|Finn|Dang, look at that sword! [''picks up the Lightning Sword''] Whoa. Feels kinda right. [''waving it around''] Whoosh. Whoosh. Vvsh, vvsh. [''points it at the wall, causing it to shoot electricity''] [''laughs''] Whoa!}}
{{L|Jake|[''laughs''] Pretty fun, huh?}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun!}}
{{L|Jake|You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train?}}
{{L|Finn|Yes! [''runs off'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''following him''] [''laughs'']}}
{{L|[''They enter a different car of the train, where some blue ants await, holding loot in each hand.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa, [[Crystal Ants]], I think! [''runs past them, zapping each with his sword'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''laughs''] Cool! [''picks up loot''] [''laughs'']}}
{{L|[''They enter another car, where some rock monsters moan and walk toward them.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Ha-ha! Yeah! [''slicing each one''] Die, die, die, die, die, die, die! [''laughs'']}}
{{L|[''Scene changes to Finn fighting several monsters in quick succession. The last one explodes, getting some of its goo on Jake.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''laughs''] [''to himself''] Welcome back, buddy.}}
{{L|Finn|Man, look at all this rad loot!}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday.}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa, what do you mean? We just started only, like, three hours ago.}}
{{L|Jake|Heheh, yeah. I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all. All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same. It's a little boring.}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, come on. [''elbows him lightly''] It's fun! Just one more car. Come on. [''elbows him''] Come on, man! [''elbows him again''] Come on!}}
{{L|Jake|All right, just one more.}}
{{L|Finn|Ha-ha, yes!}}
{{L|Jake|[''sighs'']}}
{{L|[''They enter another car, but this one appears empty.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Hmm? Where is everybody?}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, hey! Empty car—think we beat it, buddy.}}
{{L|[''A door opens behind them, out of which comes a chubby green monster with a crown that shoot fires.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa, man! Boss battle! Let's chew it up! [''runs toward the monster'']}}
{{L|Jake|Okay, but this is the last one, okay?}}
{{L|Finn|We'll see!}}
{{L|[''The monster trips Finn and blasts fire at him, singeing his hat.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Ha-ha!}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, man, [''hitting monster with a stick''] you remember we were going to that weird cave? Bet it's not too late to check it out.}}
{{L|Finn|[''attacking monster''] Eh, weird cave, weird train—I'm cool here.}}
{{L|Jake|[''sighs''] Okay.}}
{{L|Finn|Hyah! [''hits the monster's crown'']}}
{{L|[''A head grows out of the monster underneath its crown.'']}}
{{L|Head|Ahhhh, gimme a break!}}
{{L|[''The monster disappears in a flash of light and drops loot.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot! [''puts on the crown and dances''] Oh, yeah. [''the crown emits fire'']}}
{{L|[''Jake picks up the rest of the loot and tries on a glove, which makes him chubby and green like the monster. He quickly takes it off, throws it on the ground, and kicks it away.'']}}
{{L|Jake|No, thank you.}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, hurry. Next car!}}
{{L|[''They enter the next car, which contains green jelly creatures.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Slime crimes! [''starts fighting'']}}
{{L|Jake|You have fun. I'm just gonna watch. [''sits on a ledge away from the fight'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''sees a gold shield one monster dropped''] Hey.}}
{{L|[''A monster squirts some green liquid at Finn, hitting the back of his leg.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Ow! [''laughing''] Ow. Cool... acid!}}
{{L|[''The monster squirts again, but Finn picks up the shield and reflects it back at it, killing it. Finn walks over to the loot it dropped. Jake's stomach rumbles.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry?}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while.}}
{{L|Jake|More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window!}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break.}}
{{L|Jake|'Kay! Well, we'll go back to the [[Tree Fort|tree house]], and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like.}}
{{L|[''Finn kills a monster, which drops some meat.'']}}
{{L|Jake|And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or—}}
{{L|Finn|[''eating noisily''] Look. [''points to meat''] Now we don't gotta do that thing you wanted to do. [''uses his crown's flames to throw the meat at Jake'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''dodging it''] Aah!}}
{{L|Finn|Hot meat!}}
{{L|[''The scene changes to Finn entering another car, in which red ants await.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Ants again? [''goes to sit in the corner'']}}
{{L|Finn|"Ant" no thang! [''smashes one''] Yah! [''smashes another''] Caught with your "ants" down! "Ants" for nothin'! [''kills another''] Forget about "ant"! [''kicks one''] What's wrong? Feeling antsy? [''kills another and continues killing them'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''sighs''] Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. We did all the ants!}}
{{L|Finn|Same car, [''punches an ant''] but those were blue ants. These are red ants.}}
{{L|Jake|Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you.}}
{{L|Finn|Man, no way. All this feels good. [''smashes another ant''] Like my inside voice is saying, "Hey, keep it up. This is good stuff." [''two ants attack him''] Aah! Hey! [''knocks them away''] Ah! Like when you made those biscuits way back? And I kept eating them until they were all gone. Like that!}}
{{L|Jake|Finn, [''stands up''] I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter!}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah! [''smashes the last ant'']}}
{{L|[''A door opens, out of which comes the second boss.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Boss fight! [''charges at it, blasting fire from his crown'']}}
{{L|[''The monster raises its wand and blasts Finn backwards.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''laughs''] [''gets back up and continues fighting offscreen'']}}
{{L|[''Blasts from the monster's wand zoom by Jake, who is sitting in a corner. He picks up a pair of pants that one of the ants dropped and puts them on. Finn grunts and an explosion sounds.'']}}
{{L|Boss|My jacket-sta! [''disappears in a flash of light'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''holding loot''] Check it out: [[battle moon]].}}
{{L|[''A small moons orbits around his head. A crystal ball rolls toward Jake.'']}}
{{L|Jake|What? [''picks it up and looks in it''] [''gasps''] Finn! This is a [[future crystal]]! Look!}}
{{L|[''In the sphere is Finn in full armor, battling yellow Crystal Ants'']}}
{{L|Jake|That's you, dude! You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train!}}
{{L|Future Finn|[''slashes the ants''] Get "ant" of town.}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life!}}
{{L|[''Jake gapes.'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to them entering another car. Jake kicks the wall, and some [[Hair Apes]] shoot lightning at Finn, who blocks it with his shield.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, Hair Apes!}}
{{L|Jake|Nuh-uh, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house. [''opens up the side of the train''] You can come with me if you want.}}
{{L|Finn|What? No, man! It's better on the train; stuff makes sense here.}}
{{L|Hair Ape|[''hoots''] [''zaps Finn'']}}
{{L|Finn|Yow! [''laughs''] [''shoots a bolt from his wand at the ape, killing it'']}}
{{L|Jake|I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair.}}
{{L|Finn|You'll be back.}}
{{L|Jake|No, I won't, Finn. [''hops onto the outside of the train''] Goodbye!}}
{{L|[''He makes it sound like he's getting farther away by making his face smaller. He looks back in at Finn.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''sighs'']}}
{{L|[''A Hair Ape shoots some lightning at Finn, but his battle moon blocks it.'']}}
{{L|Hair Ape|[''hoots'']}}
{{L|Finn|Hey! [''laughs''] [''runs toward it''] "Hair" we go!}}
{{L|Jake|[''climbs on top of the rain, finding a Hair Ape''] What're you doin' up here?}}
{{L|Hair Ape|[''hoots''] [''shrugs'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''takes off his hat and sits next to it''] Are you gettin' sick of things down there, too?}}
{{L|Hair Ape|[''hoots'']}}
{{L|Jake|Mm-hmm.}}
{{L|[''He takes off [[Jake's pack|his pack]], and the Hair Ape pats his leg invitingly.'']}}
{{L|Jake|You're not gonna try and zap me, are you?}}
{{L|[''The Hair Ape shrugs. Jake rests his head on the Hair Ape's leg and looks up at the stars.'']}}
{{L|Jake|I wonder what my kids are doin'. [''falls asleep'']}}
{{L|[''Morning arrives, and Jake hears the Hair Ape rubbing his hands together to zap him.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hey! [''dodges zap''] I knew it!}}
{{L|[''He hits the Hair Ape, which disappears in a flurry of hair. He then picks up his pack, puts on his hat, and picks up the Hair Ape's hat.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''walks off''] Gotta find that kid. Hey, Finn! [''opens door''] Fi—oh! [''sees someone with a metal helmet, a [[Flame cloak|cloak of fire]], and a battle moon''] Umm... hey, there, friend. I ain't lookin' for no trouble. Just lookin' for my friend, Finn. Maybe you seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l—}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, hey! Jake, it's me! [''opens visor to helmet''] I'm just all souped up now.}}
{{L|Jake|Ah, jeez, Finn. I... for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys.}}
{{L|Finn|[''wiggles his tongue''] Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl.}}
{{L|Jake|Wait, you are! You are one!}}
{{L|Finn|What? Those guys are cool!}}
{{L|Jake|That's it, man! I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not! [''advancing toward him'']}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, stay back. I mean it!}}
{{L|Jake|Oh, please. What're you gonna do? I'm ten times stronger than—}}
{{L|[''Finn squirts a large amount of silk at him with his [[spider wand]].'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''laughs'']}}
{{L|Jake|Ah, gross! [''coughs'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''grabs Jake's pack''] Yoink! [''laughs''] [''runs to the next car''] Pff, Jake—tryin' to tell ''me'' what to do. Pff, yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now let's see what we got here. [''reaches into Jake's pack''] Apple, apple, chicken, apple... [''pulls out future crystal''] Oh, yeah, that little orb in which I rule! Let's see that again, orb. [''the crystal reveals an old Finn, followed by someone''] Yeah, that's right. Lookin' right. [''laughs''] Wait a second, who's that sad ward little guy followin' me around? [''camera zooms in''] Jake? All those years—he stayed with me.}}
{{L|Future Jake|Finn, can we slow down? My feet hurt.}}
{{L|Future Finn|What?}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'ma set this right.}}
{{L|[''He gets up, and his battle moon falls. He makes his way toward Jake, taking off his helmet on the way.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Finn? Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you, I swear. Just get this stuff off of me.}}
{{L|Finn|[''using wand to take back silk''] No, ''I'm'' sorry, Jake. I messed up, but don't worry. It's all over now.}}
{{L|Jake|You mean we're gettin' off the train?}}
{{L|Finn|Well... ''you'' are. I'm gonna keep playin' for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two.}}
{{L|Jake|Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'? It's got its hooks in you! [''hits Finn's head lightly'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''laughs''] No, no for real! [''pats forehead''] My inside is tellin' me it's time. Here, [''hands Jake the future crystal''] see for yourself.}}
{{L|[''The crystal displays Finn and Jake washing dishes at the Tree Fort.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, man. ''That's'' what I'm talkin' about. That... is what I'm talkin' about.}}
