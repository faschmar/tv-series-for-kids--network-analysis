{{L|[''The episode begins in the [[Desert Lands]]. The camera pans down a gigantic pillar of sand leading to an underground [[Sand City|city]]. [[Finn]] and [[Jake]] are at the base of a sand column next to some sand sculptures of soldiers.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''moans'']}}
{{L|Finn|What's wrong with you, man?}}
{{L|Jake|I ate all the candy in [[Finn's pack|your backpack]], and now I'm sick.}}
{{L|Finn|I didn't bring any candy.}}
{{L|Jake|Oh, no. That explains why it didn't taste right.}}
{{L|Finn|Nothing tastes right today. Like, I thought we were going to get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish.}}
{{L|Jake|That's how I feel—like a dying parsley. So what's goin' on with [[Spoon of Prosperity|the spoon]]? [[Marceline]] and the spoon.}}
{{L|Finn|Um... [''looks at the spoon on top of the column''] nothing. [''The spoon is lifted up and comes down.''] Wait, there she goes!}}
{{L|Marceline|[''invisible''] Yo, wake up, sand dude. [''taps a sand soldier with the spoon, causing the sculpture to crumble.''] I think they're dead. [''brings spoon over to Finn and becomes visible''] A spoon.}}
{{L|Finn|[''takes spoon''] Yea-uh. The Spoon of Prosperity!}}
{{L|Jake|It doesn't look like mu—[''belches'']}}
{{L|[''The belch echoes and causes more sculptures to crumble.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Oh, my gosh, I feel so much better! Hungry, even. Guys, let's go home!}}
{{L|Finn|We've gotta get this spoon to [[Princess Bubblegum]] first.}}
{{L|Jake|[''running off''] ♪Let's rock!♪}}
{{L|Marceline|What's PB want with that spoon, anyway?}}
{{L|Finn|Beats me.}}
{{L|Jake|Sometimes it's better ''not'' to know.}}
{{L|Marceline|Yeah, I guess that's true with Bonnibel.}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, guys, look what I found! [''starts sinking in the sand'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Is that quicksand?}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah! [''laughs''] [''tries to get out several times but keeps falling back''] Heh. Quicksand is pretty fun. Heh.}}
{{L|Finn|Quit messing around, Jake.}}
{{L|Jake|Okie-doke.}}
{{L|[''Jake [[Stretchy Powers|stretches]] an arm from his head to the support underneath the platform Finn and Marceline are on. The support crumbles, and Finn falls.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa!}}
{{L|[''More structures behind them crumble.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hmm. Hey, is this whole place made out of sand?}}
{{L|Marceline|Sure looks that way.}}
{{L|Jake|Uh, give me a pull, please. [''stretches his upper body to Finn and Marceline, who grab him and pull''] [''laughs''] Stop, you guys are tickling me! Let me try this other thing. [''shapeshifts his body into a corkscrew''] Flesh drill!}}
{{L|Finn|I'm not sure that's a good idea—}}
{{L|[''Jake starts drilling, rumbling the entire city.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''screams''] Yaah! Rug burn! Ow! Ow!}}
{{L|[''The large pillar of sand collapses.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Aah! [''escapes the quicksand''] Whoo! It worked! Jake drill worked, you guys.}}
{{L|[''Marceline grabs them and floats upwards to avoid the avalanche of sand coming their way.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa!}}
{{L|Jake|Check it out! My piggies are free. [''wiggles toes'']}}
{{L|Marceline|You just demolished half the underground city!}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, only half.}}
{{L|Finn|You also sealed our exit.}}
{{L|Jake|Our ''only'' exit.}}
{{L|Marceline|[''groans''] [''drops Jake'']}}
{{L|Jake|No regre-e-e-ets! [''tumbles down a hill''] I'm sorry. [''touches his toe''] This little piggie stayed home, and so should have I. I know! I'll dig us out of here.}}
{{L|Finn & Marceline|No!}}
{{L|Finn|You'll bury us alive!}}
{{L|Marceline|Undead!}}
{{L|Finn|[''takes out his [[holo technology|holo-pendant]]''] Finn to PB. Come in, PB.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Oh, hi, Finn.}}
{{L|Finn|Princess, we're trapped in the underground city.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Yeah-yeah. That sounds great.}}
{{L|Finn|Huh? No, we need help!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|That's great! [''display glitches''] Gre-gre-great! Great, great!}}
{{L|Finn|[''sighs''] Guess we lost the signal. [''puts away pendant'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Any more bright ideas?}}
{{L|Jake|Snacks!}}
{{L|Marceline|How are snacks gonna get us out of here?}}
{{L|Jake|I wanna eat snacks... because I am hungry.}}
{{L|Marceline|I'm hungry, too. Bust the snacks, Finn.}}
{{L|Jake|Bust, bust, bust!}}
{{L|[''Finn takes off his pack and dumps its contents on the ground. Jake takes a cookie out of the pile.'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Hey, where are my red erasers? They were in here.}}
{{L|Jake|Uh-oh. I thought they were candy.}}
{{L|Marceline|You... ate all... MY RED?!?!}}
{{L|Jake|Oooh. I'm sorry!}}
{{L|Finn|Calm down, Marceline. There's gotta be some red stuff in these ruins. I'll go explore. You guys hang out here and save your energy.}}
{{L|Marceline|Thanks, Finn.}}
{{L|Finn|[''walking off''] Be cool.}}
{{L|Jake|[''eats cookie''] So how hungry ''are'' you?}}
{{L|Marceline|[''hisses'']}}
{{L|Jake|Aah! [''cowers''] I'm sorry. Please don't eat my blood!}}
{{L|Marceline|[''sighs''] Jake, I don't want to hurt you, but you should know things get crazy when I'm hungry.}}
{{L|Jake|Like... how crazy?}}
{{L|Marceline|I'm gonna go into feral mode. [''sighs''] It's not gonna be pretty.}}
{{L|Jake|[''whimpers''] [''eats the rest of his cookie'']}}
{{L|Marceline|I know. Let's tie me up. That way, you won't be scared.}}
{{L|Jake|And that will keep you from draining my bloods?}}
{{L|Marceline|Not physically, no, but as a prop, I think it'll be good for both of us. You know, psychologically.}}
{{L|Jake|[''gulps''] [''whispers''] Hurry, Finn.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Finn passing some streams of lava.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Red, red, red. I guess even a [[Vampires|vampire]] queen's face would melt off if she tried to eat lava.}}
{{L|[''Scene switches to Marceline, who is tied up to a sand column.'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Get me a bucket of lava, Jake.}}
{{L|Jake|[''eating a sandwich''] Yo, you know better than that.}}
{{L|Marceline|Do iiiit...}}
{{L|Jake|Don't go crazy, okay?}}
{{L|Marceline|I'm frickin' hungry.}}
{{L|Jake|[''gulps''] Why did you leave me here, dude? [''bites sandwich'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts back to Finn. He arrives at a large door of sand held up by four skeletons, behind which some red light is emanating.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Okay, here we go. Yeah, look at that! [''points to red glow''] Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm. [''looks at skeletons''] Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wisemen-zerts <!--?-->. Oh, well. Gotta feed the Marcy monster. [''walks up to door''] 'Scuse me. Up, sorry. Okay. Uhh... hi-yah! [''kicks the door, which collapses''] Oh, dag.}}
{{L|[''Finn looks into a room full of immobile sand people bathing in the red light coming from a crown on a skeleton at the other side of the room.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Cool... What the heck happened here? [''grabs a hat from one of the skeletons''] Whoop! [''throws hat in the red light, which turns it to sand''] Ew. Whoops. Y'alls got turned ''into'' sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this. [''walks along the edge of the room''] Around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm... [''sees that the source of the light is coming from a hole behind the skeleton''] Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right?}}
{{L|[''The skeleton does not respond.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Okay. I was just making sure. [''crawls into hole''] Bet that guy was a creep. [''continues crawling''] This hole is deep.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts back to Jake.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Oh, my [[Grob Gob Glob Grod|Glob]]. Oh, my Glob, where are you, man? Marcy's wiggin' out!}}
{{L|Marceline|Jaaaake...}}
{{L|Jake|What?}}
{{L|Marceline|I can smell your insides, Jake. [''laughs''] They smell... [''sniffs deeply''] red!}}
{{L|Jake|[''screams'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Yeah, lemme see in there.}}
{{L|Jake|[''screams'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Oh, yeah.}}
{{L|Jake|[''screams'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts back to Finn.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Maybe I should go back. Well, I've already gone this far. [''reaches the end of the tunnel, where a red gem is shining light''] Shebang! That oughtta be enough red to un... [''notices that the red light is coming from a large turtle creature behind the gem''] Oops.}}
{{L|[[Crab Demon]]|Paris? Is that you?}}
{{L|Finn|You mean the guy with the big thing on his head?}}
{{L|Crab Demon|Yes. Have you returned to complete the plan?}}
{{L|Finn|Naw. Paris is, like, super dead.}}
{{L|Crab Demon|What?! No! How long?}}
{{L|Finn|Dude, like, a really long time. Like five hundred years.}}
{{L|Crab Demon|[''in disbelief''] Five hundred—[''sighs''] Chum! I must've zoned out!}}
{{L|Finn|What the heck were you two doing?}}
{{L|Crab Demon|Once we turned the city to sand, we were gonna reanimate their bodies and conquer my homeland at the center of the planet.}}
{{L|Finn|Hm, that's dumb.}}
{{L|Crab Demon|Time to go back home a true loser.}}
{{L|Finn|Can I have this big ol' ruby, then?}}
{{L|Crab Demon|That's an emerald.}}
{{L|Finn|Clearly it's a big ol' ruby.}}
{{L|Crab Demon|I don't know what to tell you, man.}}
{{L|Finn|I would like the ruby.}}
{{L|Crab Demon|It's yours, buddy. [''gets up''] I'm outties. [''backs out]'']}}
{{L|Finn|Peace. Hyup! [''jumps down and tries to pull the ruby out''] [''strains''] [''farts''] Whoops.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Marceline, who is buried up to her demonic face in sand.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Okay, [''pats sand''] all done now. Nice and snug, right?}}
{{L|Marceline|Jake...}}
{{L|Jake|[''gulps''] What?}}
{{L|Marceline|I won't be able to... to control myself much longer. I can feel the feeding frenzy coming on. [''licks teeth''] I just wanna let you know I'm sorry. [''laughs evilly'']}}
{{L|Jake|You're sick!}}
{{L|Marceline|Yeah... [''laughs'']}}
{{L|Jake|C'mon, Jake, think... [''groans''] It's no good! I need brain food. [''looks at pile of Finn's junk''] Oh, dang, I ate everything! [''moans''] I'm so hungry! Baby's gonna starve to death! Unless... [''looks at Marceline'']}}
{{L|Marceline|What?}}
{{L|Jake|[''laughs''] [''licks lips'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts back to Finn, who is pushing the ruby back through the tunnel.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''straining''] [''stops and cries a little''] [''resumes pushing'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''panting''] [''digs a lava moat around Marceline'']}}
{{L|Marceline|What are you doing?}}
{{L|Jake|I'm cooking up a crazy vampire! That should heat up nice! The sand will keep the meat moist.}}
{{L|Marceline|You're gonna eat me?}}
{{L|Jake|You was gonna eat me!}}
{{L|Marceline|Yes, I am. [''laughs'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''blows lava''] Cook, baby, cook!}}
{{L|[''Finn arrives with the ruby.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Finn!}}
{{L|Finn|[''falls to the ground, exhausted''] Bleh. The trick is rollin' it. Phew! Check out this ruby I got.}}
{{L|Jake|That's an emerald, dude.}}
{{L|Finn|You too now?! Emeralds are green, boyee.}}
{{L|Jake|This thing ''is'' green.}}
{{L|Finn|Why is everybody messin' with me? It's like a dark gray-ish red. Mostly gray. Sometimes red things are gray!}}
{{L|Jake|You're a little colorblind... and there's nothin' to be ashamed of!}}
{{L|[''The "ruby" is now green.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Oh... whoops.}}
{{L|Jake|I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far.}}
{{L|Finn|Uh, what's goin' on with Marcy?}}
{{L|Jake|She was threatening to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her. I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice.}}
{{L|[''Marceline is now missing.'']}}
{{L|Jake|I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What? [''looks behind him to see that Marceline is gone''] [''gasps'']}}
{{L|Finn|Chill, man!}}
{{L|Jake|No, we gotta book! [''pushes Finn into tunnel''] Go!}}
{{L|Marceline|[''floating near the ceiling''] Go where, Jake? [''laughs''] I gotta suck out your insides first, right?}}
{{L|Finn|Nay-nay, brah!}}
{{L|Jake|[''babbles'']}}
{{L|Marceline|Time to eat! [''The ceiling rumbles.''] Huh? What the—?}}
{{L|[''A [[Sand Worm|large worm]] breaks through the ceiling. Princess Bubblegum is in its mouth, controlling it.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Bubblegum?}}
:{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Hey, guys. I saw my seismograph had gone off the charts, so I figured you might be in trouble, right?}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, but watch out for Marceline. She's gone rabid!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|What? Marceline's gonna rap for me?}}
{{L|[''Marceline grabs Princess Bubblegum and bites her hair, sucking nearly all of her blood in the process due to the feeding frenzy.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|[''screams'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|[''gasp'']}}
{{L|Marceline|[''sighs''] Woof. Thanks, Bonnie. That's enough low-grade red to get me home, at least. Come on, guys. Let's go.}}
{{L|Finn|Are you alright, PB?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|[''weakly''] Did you get the Spoon of Prosperity?}}
{{L|Finn|[''takes it out of his pack''] Yeah, here you go. [''hands it to her'']}}
{{L|[''Princess Bubblegum places it on her nose, and she returns to normal.'']}}
{{L|Finn, Jake, & Marceline|Whoa.}}
{{L|[''Finn, Jake, and Marceline applaud.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Peeps will never starve in ''my'' eternal empire. Sand worm, up!}}
{{L|[''The sand worm leaps upward as the city fills with lava.'']}}
