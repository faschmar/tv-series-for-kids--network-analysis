{{L|[''The episode begins with [[Finn]], [[Jake]], and the [[Swamp Giant]] falling from a great height. They are both gripping onto the giant.'']}}
{{L|Swamp Giant| AAAAH!}}
{{L|Finn| Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the [[Mini Queen]]!}}
{{L|Swamp Giant| NEVER!!}}
{{L|[''The three scream as they fall. Squeaking is heard.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Huh? [''He finds the Mini Queen.''] Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er!}}
{{L|Jake| Then hold my hand, dude! [''Finn does so.''] Whoooop!}}
{{L|[''Jake inflates, making himself and Finn reach terminal velocity sooner and float gently to the ground.'']}}
{{L|Swamp Giant| Aaaah! Oof!}}
{{L|[''The swamp giant hits the ground. Finn and Jake land on the flattened giant. Jake lets his air out and deflates.'']}}
{{L|Finn| My inflatable angel.}}
{{L|Jake| Heh heh heh. [''They jump off the giant.''] How's the Mini Queen?}}
{{L|Finn| I dunno. Can't understand a word she says. [''The Mini Queen promptly writes a message on Finn's hand that says, "THANK YOU 4 SAVING ME, XOXO CALL ME." The Mini Queen shapes her antennae to look like a heart.''] Aww! My pleasure, ma'am! I just like beating up evil! [''Finn performs a "handshake" with one of her antennae. She squeaks.''] Okay... Didn't... catch any of that either.}}
{{L|[''The Mini Queen jumps on Jake's nose and then leaps away.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Sniffs''] Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky. [Sniffs] No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way! [''He sniffs the ground and follows a scent. The scent leads him to a [[Nothung|sword]].''] Whoa!}}
{{L|Finn| What?}}
{{L|Jake| [''In awe''] Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy!}}
{{L|Finn| [[Billy]]?!}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| [''Singing''] BIIILLYYYYYY!!!}}
{{L|[''Flashback'']}}
{{L|Young Billy| Nothung!}}
{{L|[''The sword comes to Billy and sparks lightning dramatically. The musical sequence begins.'']}}
{{L|[''Back in the present'']}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, yeah! That was the most mathematical thing ever!}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear!}}
{{L|Finn| This is so cool!}}
{{L|[''He attempts to pull out the sword. The ground cracks and makes a hole in the side of the mountain appear.'']}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Whoa!}}
{{L|Finn| It's Billy's legendary crack!}}
{{L|[''They go inside. They gasp as they are treated with Billy's presence.'']}}
{{L|Billy| [''Sighs''] Hello.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Whispering to Jake''] It's him! It's him!!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Whispering''] I know, I know! Be cool!!}}
{{L|Billy| Yep. It's me.}}
{{L|Finn| Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!}}
{{L|Billy| What for?}}
{{L|Finn| So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!}}
{{L|Jake| I wanna be the dog version of you!}}
{{L|Billy| Ahh, that'd be a waste of time.}}
{{L|Jake| Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups!}}
{{L|Billy| No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail.}}
{{L|Jake| Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch! [''He tries to catch his tail, of course to no avail.''] Ah... ah...}}
{{L|Finn| What do you mean, "pointless?" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!}}
{{L|Billy| You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead. [''Finn gasps.''] In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog.}}
{{L|[''Billy points to his [[Dogs#Billy's Dog|skeleton of a dog]].'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Scared, yet smiling''] Heh... I'm gonna pass out... [''Falls backward'']}}
{{L|Billy| All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures. [''Deep sigh''] But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!}}
{{L|Jake| What other way is there?}}
{{L|Billy| Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.}}
{{L|Finn| Nonviolently?? [''Sighs''] I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...}}
{{L|Jake| Me, too!}}
{{L|Finn| Billy, I won't let you down!}}
{{L|Jake| I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy!}}
{{L|[''They run away screaming. Billy sighs wearily. The scene shifts to the Grass Lands. Finn is riding on Jake.'']}}
{{L|Finn| This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct.}}
{{L|Jake| Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people.}}
{{L|Cobbler| Help! Help! [''Finn and Jake notice his cries.''] A monster! [''The cobbler runs into Jake's leg. Jake retracts.''] Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible [[Dragons|Dragon]]! Please, please help!}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, uh...}}
{{L|Jake| Oh...}}
{{L|Cobbler| Act quickly! He's almost upon us!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Straightforward''] Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore.}}
{{L|Cobbler| No, but please! [''Stammers frantically'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''To Jake''] Dude. We gotta do something to help him.}}
{{L|Jake| I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz.}}
{{L|Finn| [''To cobbler''] Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?}}
{{L|Cobbler| Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry.}}
{{L|Jake| Say no more. [''Walking away, pulling Finn with him''] Come on, Finn.}}
{{L|Cobbler| Where're you going?!}}
{{L|Jake| To make you somethin' to eat!}}
{{L|[''They leave. The dragon arrives.'']}}
{{L|Cobbler| AAAH!! NO!! HELP!!}}
{{L|[''The dragon attacks him by breathing fire. The scene transitions to a town where Finn and Jake are running a food stand.'']}}
{{L|Finn| I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon.}}
{{L|Jake| Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im. [''Yelling out''] Gruel! Get your free gruel!}}
{{L|Lady| [''Walking up to stand''] What's this all about?}}
{{L|Finn| Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure!}}
{{L|Lady| Hahaha! [''Eats gruel''] I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate.}}
{{L|Finn| [Victoriously] YEAH!!!}}
{{L|[Cut to the other townspeople eating Finn and Jake's gruel.]}}
{{L|Finn| This is great, Jake!}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, we're really helpin' people!}}
{{L|Finn| Whoa! Look who it is!}}
{{L|[''The cobbler walks up to Finn and Jake. There are scorch marks on him.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Dude! You're alive!}}
{{L|Cobbler| [''Angrily''] No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for... [''Unsure''] a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week—}}
{{L|[''Jake shushes him.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Deliberate''] Dude. Gruel.}}
{{L|Cobbler| Oh, thank you! [''Eats it''] Hahahaha! Hahaha. [''His hand suddenly becomes encased in stone.''] AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!}}
{{L|Finn| Huh? [''Holds up glass with potion in it''] Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor.}}
{{L|Cobbler| Wha? Ah... uh?!}}
{{L|[''More of his body becomes encased in stone. The cobbler strikes himself with a fork, and it has no effect. The cobbler panics.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Dude... how much of that potion did you use?}}
{{L|[''Finn holds up five more empty potion bottles. The townspeople have grown armor as well. One of the townspeople's belly button starts shooting flames.'']}}
{{L|Townsperson| AAAAH!! MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!!}}
{{L|Finn| [To Jake] Geez... I thought people would like that.}}
{{L|Cobbler| Why?! Why would anyone want that?!}}
{{L|Finn| So you can defend against evil monsters!}}
{{L|Cobbler| You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!}}
{{L|Finn| No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!}}
{{L|Cobbler| Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!}}
{{L|Finn| Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| [''Thinking''] Hmmmmmm...}}
{{L|Cobbler| WHAT?! NO—}}
{{L|[''Cut to the shoe-repair shop.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Alright! We're cobblers!}}
{{L|Cobbler| No, you're not!! You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist! [''Leaving''] And don't try to cobble anything!}}
{{L|Jake| [''To Finn''] What does "cobble" mean, anyway?}}
{{L|Finn| I think it has something to do with shoes...}}
{{L|[[Fine Lady]]| [''Entering shop''] Excuse me! Can you help me? I need a broken heel fixed. I'm going to a fancy funeral.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Taking shoe and heel''] Of course I'll help!}}
{{L|[''Scene transition. Finn is hammering in the heel.'']}}
{{L|Finn| There! [''Rolling over to lady''] Whah! [''He puts the shoe on her foot.''] Pa-kow!!}}
{{L|Fine Lady| Ah!}}
{{L|[''She seems content with the repair. Suddenly, a blade comes out of the shoe. The lady makes a small gasp.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!}}
{{L|Jake| [''To Finn''] Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?}}
{{L|Finn| Maybe... [''The shoe arms axes, an extra blade, and a lasso.''] Whoa!}}
{{L|Jake| Cool!}}
{{L|Fine Lady| I cannot go to the funeral in these!}}
{{L|Cobbler| [''Entering shop''] Hey, everyone! I'm back from the doctor! [''The lady's shoe lace lasso's the cobbler.''] WHY?! [''The lace forces the cobbler to the ground.'']}}
{{L|Fine Lady| [''To Finn and Jake''] ...And I'm not supposed to bring a guest.}}
{{L|Cobbler| [''To Finn and Jake''] GET OUT!!}}
{{L|[''Cut to outside the shop.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent.}}
{{L|Jake| Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're "sucking" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Frustrated sigh''] Totes. I'll stop "pooping" my diaper.}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa, what?!}}
{{L|Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button| HELP! I NEED MEDICAL HELP!!}}
{{L|Finn| Medical help? Hmmmmm...}}
{{L|[''The scene shifts to the hospital where Finn and Jake are doctors.'']}}
{{L|Finn| How can we help?}}
{{L|[[Lumpy Space Princess]]| I want surgery to make my body hot.}}
{{L|Finn| Yikes...}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah. I know I'm already pretty smokin'... but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Whistles''] [''To Finn''] You up for some serious plastic surgery?}}
{{L|[''The Adventure Time logo swirls onto the screen.'']}}
{{L|[''Lumpy Space Princess comes out of the hospital with a new body, complete with legs.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Aw, yeah! This body's hot! And powerful! [''Suddenly, machine parts form on her body like a cyborg.''] Huh?! Aw, what?! [''Her legs turns into a wheel. She makes pained noises.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Dude, did you use a magic nail again?}}
{{L|Finn| I've got three left!}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Ohhhh... [''She gains a robotic eye.''] What did you do to me??}}
{{L|Finn| We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right?}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| No one thinks this look is hot!!}}
{{L|[''The cobbler suddenly walks up.'']}}
{{L|Cobbler| [''To Lumpy Space Princess''] Oh, my laces! You're the most beautiful— [''He suddenly gets shot with a laser from her robotic eye.'']}}
{{L|Lumpy Space Princess| Huh?!}}
{{L|[''Her wheel activates, and she speeds into the cobbler. The townsperson with the flame-shooting belly button runs by again screaming.'']}}
{{L|Finn| ...Jake...?}}
{{L|Jake| ....Yeah...?}}
{{L|Finn| I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out...}}
{{L|Jake| Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive!}}
{{L|Finn| I just wanna sit here and moan.}}
{{L|Jake| Then I'll moan with ya, buddy.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Moaning''] Thaaaanks, buuuddy...}}
{{L|Jake| [''Moaning''] Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome...}}
{{L|[Finn and Jake notice more cries for help.]}}
{{L|[[Old Lady (His Hero)|Old Lady]]| AAAH! AAAH! HELP ME!!}}
{{L|Swamp Giant| Hahaha! Relax! I'm just gonna grind you up!!}}
{{L|Old Lady| AAAH! AAAH!}}
{{L|Jake| [''To Finn''] Aw, man, this grass-bag again?? [''Heroically''] HEY, EVIL-DOER! [''Weakly''] Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here.}}
{{L|Swamp Giant| It's not evil!! When they get this old, they ''wanna'' be ground up!! Hahaha! Right, you old bat?!}}
{{L|Old Lady| Help!!}}
{{L|[''Finn sweats.'']}}
{{L|Swamp Giant| Right?!?}}
{{L|[''Finn strains, visibly in conflict.'']}}
{{L|Old Lady| Oooh!! Aaah!!}}
{{L|[''Finn raises his fist.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm...}}
{{L|Swamp Giant| [''To Old Lady''] Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Furiously''] WRONG!!!! [''He punches and uppercuts the Swamp Giant, saving the Old Lady.''] [''Quietly, to Jake''] I couldn't think of anything...}}
{{L|Old Lady| Whooo! [''Falls in Finn's and Jake's arms'']}}
{{L|Finn| POOP!! I saved her with violence...}}
{{L|Old Lady| What's your huff, son?}}
{{L|Finn| The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down.}}
{{L|Old Lady| Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out! And you did it with violence! Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures! [''Punches Finn''] Just like I was born to be an old lady! Don't deny your rowdy nature, paladins! [''Starts dancing''] And don't take advice from old people! [''Continues dancing'']}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point!}}
{{L|Jake| Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo—}}
{{L|Finn| It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!!}}
{{L|Jake| Cha!!}}
{{L|[''Scene transition to Billy's cave.'']}}
{{L|Finn| It's us again.}}
{{L|Jake| And we've got exciting news!}}
{{L|Billy| Aw, I don't—I don't wanna buy anything.}}
{{L|Finn| Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns.}}
{{L|Billy| Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead!}}
{{L|Jake| She's right here. [''Turns around, revealing her'']}}
{{L|Old Lady| Hello!}}
{{L|[''Billy gasps.'']}}
{{L|Finn| We saved 'er, Billy.}}
{{L|Jake| You saved 'er.}}
{{L|Finn| I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these! [''Holds up fists and leg''] And look how happy she is, man! She's elated!}}
{{L|Billy| Hmm. Perhaps you're right. [''Pained groan''] It's... it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being... You wanna watch? [''He reveals a literal void in his stomach. Finn and Jake gasp. The hole starts filling up with body mass.''] Nothung! [''The sword comes back once again.''] Finn and Jake... truly, you are my heroes. [''They laugh excitedly.''] Now you're freakin' me out... [''Finn, Jake, and the old lady climb on Billy enthusiastically. Finn and Jake are taken off.'']}}
{{L|Jake| We're his heroes!!}}
{{L|[''Billy looks at the old lady.'']}}
{{L|Billy| Huh... Hello.}}
{{L|Jake| Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!!}}
{{L|Billy| Get outta here!!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake run out quickly, laughing heartily. As Finn and Jake happily wander off, Billy nods contentedly. The episode comes to a close.'']}}
