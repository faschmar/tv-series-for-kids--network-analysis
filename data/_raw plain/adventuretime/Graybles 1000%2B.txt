{{L|Bird|Hello-lable!}}
{{L|Tuber|Cuber? Lable brother? Where are you?}}
{{L|Cuber (Baby)|Oh, this cave air is doing wonders for my physiological... Bable, bable, bable, bable, bable...}}
{{L|[''Echoing'']}}
{{L|Cuber (Baby)|Oh! [''Falling''] Aaaaaaah! Oh! But I'm a baby! Tuber? Sister Tuber? Bable, bable, bable...}}
{{L|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''Creature growling''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}
{{L|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''Footsteps approaching''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}
{{L|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''Creature roars''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}
{{L|Cuber (Baby)|Aaaaaaah!}}
{{L|Cuber|<nowiki>Hmm? Aah! Oh, you surprised your old pal, Cuber aboard his spaceship. Oh, this old grayble? [</nowiki>''chuckles''<nowiki>] It's just sentimental blabling. You know, the present can be far more interesting than the past. [</nowiki>''walks over to the window''<nowiki>] Let's see. Oh! It's a space wedding! Let's go in for a closer look. Easy... [</nowiki>''Cuber accidentally flies forward too far, smashing the space bride's helmet and causing her drift into space''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}
{{L|Alien groom|내 신부를 위해 복수할 기다! (I will revenge for my bride!)}}
{{L|[''Lasers fire at Cuber's ship. The alarm starts to sound, and then explodes.'']}}
{{L|Cuber|[''Grabs bag of graybles while moving toward his escape pod''] Wable. Bable, bable. Bable, bable, bable.}}
{{L|[''Escape pod launches toward planet and three small hostile ships follow it. Cuber's escape pod crashes, creating a large crater. Cuber gets out of it, climbs out of the crater, and moves away from his pod. The three hostile ships arrive and shoot Cuber's escape pod, which promptly explodes.'']}}
{{L|Cuber|Oh! [''runs away from crater''] Survival! Remember your training. [''whimpers, takes out a grayble from bag''] Trust your graybles. Oh, and you children at home, don't bother trying to guess tonight's theme. Applesauce to a theme! Your friend Cuber doesn't want to die!}}
{{L|[''Graybles begin to play'']}}
{{L|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''Wind whistling''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}
{{L|BMO|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''Watching clouds''<nowiki>] Oh, come on.</nowiki>}}
{{L|[''whistling continues'']}}
{{L|BMO|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''Looks down, sees Finn digging a hole''<nowiki>] It's Finn. Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a cliff diver!</nowiki>}}
{{L|Finn|What?!}}
{{L|[''BMO jumps off treehouse, and Finn catches him.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''walking back toward hole in progress''] BMO, you got to let me dig this hole. It's important.}}
{{L|BMO|A hole, you say?}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah. We beat this evil wizard, see, and we stole his giant wand.}}
{{L|Jake|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''sitting on a reclining beach chair with a magazine over his face''<nowiki>] Don't listen to him, BMO. </nowiki>''I'' beat the wizard, so I'm making Finn dig the hole, even though I could do it in like two seconds. Heh, heh, heh.}}
{{L|BMO|Rude!}}
{{L|Finn|This wand is crazy powerful, right? It's a thought cannon. It makes anything that you think of turn real.}}
{{L|BMO|Up, please.}}
{{L|Finn|So it's too strong, so we're burying it for safety.}}
{{L|Jake|I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd use that cannon and imagine a hole.}}
{{L|BMO|Jake, remember what they say about absolutely power.}}
{{L|Jake|I'm tired of your wisdom, BMO! [''gets up, walks toward wand''] Now watch and learn! Yeah, okay, my name's Jake, and I'm gonna take this magic thought cannon, and I'm gonna think, I want a hole to bury this thought cannon in, and bobble, bobble, Jake gets a hole in which a thought cannon may be buried!}}
{{L|Finn|What if for a split second you think of something else?}}
{{L|Jake|Nope, my brain's my hands!}}
{{L|[''thought cannon warbling'']}}
{{L|[''sizzling'']}}
{{L|[''A sub sandwich has appeared in the hole'']}}
{{L|Jake|Whoops! Looks like I was thinking about a sandwich. [''muffled''] Enjoy your labor! Heh, heh, heh.}}
{{L|Finn|[''sighs'']}}
{{L|BMO|I used to wish I was you. Now I just wish you would dig faster.}}
{{L|[''years in the future, the tree house has grown much taller. Cuber is digging up Finn's hole.'']}}
{{L|[''dirt scraping'']}}
{{L|Cuber|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''Grunting while digging''<nowiki>] What's this, friends? ["Scrapes the dirt off and pulls the thought cannon from the dirt"] Could it be the aformabled thought cannon? "Bobble, bobble" as the dead might say. That's the power of graybles.</nowiki>}}
{{L|Aliens|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''Walking toward hole that Cuber is in''<nowiki>] 에잇, 누가던진거야 이거?(Shoot, who threw this thing?)</nowiki>}}
{{L|Cuber|[''gasps'']}}

{{L|[''crash'']}}
{{L|Ice King|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''yawns''<nowiki>] [</nowiki>''smacks lips''<nowiki>] Good morning, madness. [</nowiki>''takes off blanket, sees right leg bent unnaturally''<nowiki>] What?! Broken leg again! [</nowiki>''sighs''<nowiki>] and... [</nowiki>''snaps leg back into place''<nowiki>] Hup! [</nowiki>''pained''<nowiki>] Hello! How are you?! Oh! Gunther, did you see how this happened?</nowiki>}}
{{L|[''Gunther drops brick.'']}}
