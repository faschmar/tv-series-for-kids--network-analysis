===Act 1===
''[The family waves at their TV which is revealed to be on a camera.]'' <br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[squawks]'' "That's a wrap, people!" <br>
''[Hector is now snoring.]'' <br>
'''Carlos:''' "Impressive new camera, Sergio." <br>
''[Sergio flies over to Hector.]'' <br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[squawks]'' "Check out the zoom." <br>
''[Sergio zooms in on Hector's nose while he is still snoring and sees the disgust inside Hector's nose. The family sees it on the TV.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "That's a lot of nose hair." <br>
''[CJ is disgusted]'' <br>
'''CJ:''' "It's like a jungle in there." <br>
''[Ronnie Anne laughs]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[holding Ernesto Estrella merch]'' "Mino, it's finally happening! My favorite astrologer, Ernesto Estrella is coming to visit me!" ''[drops merch]'' "I mean, Great Lake City, where I live!"  ''[picks up a poster]'' "He's promoting his new book! I have so many things for him to sign!" ''[picks up crystal ball]'' "The Ernesto Estrella crystal ball!" ''[picks up scale]'' "The Ernesto Estrella Bathroom Scale!" <br>
'''Ernesto:''' "You're perfect!" <br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[picks up doll]'' "The Ernesto Estrella plush doll!" <br>
''[CJ pulls the string]'' <br>
'''Ernesto:''' "Es tu destino!" <br>
''[They all scream when Ernesto leaves a explosion of glitter.]'' <br>
''[CJ holds the plushy]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' "I have to camp out at the bookstore so I am first in line to meet him!" ''[leaves]'' <br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Now awake]'' "That's ridiculous. I wouldn't camp out for anything!" <br>
'''Rosa''' ''[comes back]'' "If anyone wants dinner, i'll be making tacos in line." <br>
'''Hector:''' "Hmm..." ''[jumps out of chair and rips his shirt, revealing a fisherman outfit.]'' "Let's go see the bobo!"
----
''{At the Bookstore, Hector struggles to get out of a tent.]''<br>
''[Ronnie Anne blows bubblegum.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Wow, lots of people are here to see Ernesto Estrella!" <br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[while making tacos]'' "And I am going to see him first!" <br>
''[In the front, Carl is selling the spot and Bobby is eating a taco.]'' <br>
'''Carl:''' "Get your front spot here! $100 for cutsies!" <br>
'''Teenager:''' "I don't want your spot, but how much for the taco?" <br>
'''Carl:''' "How about 5 bucks?" <br>
''[Carl receives the money, Bobby squirts hot sauce on the taco and Carl snatches the taco before he eats it. This causes Bobby's teeth to shatter and fall onto the plate.]'' <br>
'''Bobby:''' "Aww!" <br>
''[Ronnie Anne gets a phone call. It's Lincoln. She answers it. He blows a bubblegum too.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hey, Lincoln! What's up?" <br>
'''Lincoln:''' "I finally did it, Ronnie Anne! I learned how to shape my gum into a race car. Check it out!" <br>
''[Lincoln shows her the gum. It does not look like a car.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[nervously]'' "Yeah, Lincoln, looks just like a race car. Check this out." <br>
''[Lincoln sees her gum. It looks like the Statue of Liberty.]'' <br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Statue of Libergum? That's amazing! Hey, is that a tent behind you? Hope I'm not innterupting a family vacation thing." <br>
'''Hector:''' "Aye aye aye!" ''[grunts under the tent]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "More like my Abuela trying to see our favorite astrologer celebrity type thing." <br>
''[Lincoln laughs]'' <br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Oh yeah, typical family outing. Well, I'm gonna go work on my gum tricks. See ya!" <br>
''[Lincoln hangs up]'' <br>
'''Lincoln:''' "How did she do that?" <br>
''[He tries again and twists his tounge. At that moment, Lynn Sr. comes in his room holding muffins. He sees Lincoln twisting, then leaves]'' <br>
'''Messenger:''' ''[In megaphone]'' "May I have your attention please? I have an important message from Ernesto Estrella." <br>
''[He puts away the megaphone and picks up a tablet.]'' <br>
'''Ernesto:''' ''[In tablet]'' "Hola! It is I, Ernesto Estrella." ''[rubs his head]'' "I am getting a strong sign that Great Lake City is extremely bad luck right now. I will return when the dark cloud has lifted. Until next time, cono mas es suerte." ''[kisses of glitter turn off the tablet.]'' <br>
'''Audience:''' "Boooo!" <br>
''[they throw stuff at the messenger]'' <br>
'''Messenger:''' "Okay guys, ow! I'm just the messenger!" <br>
''[Rosa looks sad and her balloon pops.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "C'mon Abuela, let's get out of here." <br>
''[Everyone leaves the area. Hector finally sets up the tent.]'' <br>
'''Hector:''' "Okay, the tent's done. Hello? Where is everyone?" <br>
''[The tent becomes undone.]'' 
----
[Back home, everyone is at the table except Rosa.]'' <br>
'''Carl:''' "Ugh, what a waste of time! Except for the tacos, of course." <br>
''[Carl burps in the shape of a taco and eats it again.]'' <br>
'''Carl:''' "Mmmm, El Pastor burps." <br>
'''Hector:''' "I always thought Ernesto Estrella was a bobo." <br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No one would believe that an entire city could be bad luck." <br>
''[Rosa is under the table.]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mija, what are you doing up there? Get under the table where it's safe!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Abuela, we're not doing that."<br>
''[She covers Rosa. Rosa gets up.]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' "Then I must sage the whole house!" <br>
''[Dresses up with vegetables.]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' "The only way to lift this curse is to use Ernesto Estrella's immortal words!" <br>
''[In the kitchen, she is using the vegetables to draw away the bad luck.]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' "Vete, vete, vete, Mala suerte, suerte, suerte. Bad luck, go away! Come again another day!" <br>
''[Rosa keeps doing this as CJ and Carl grab juices.]'' <br>
'''Carl:''' "What flavor juice box do you want for the park? Red or purple." <br>
'''CJ:''' "Hmm, purple!" <br>
'''Ernesto:''' ''[shows up in ghost]'' "Great Lake City is bad luck, Rosa. Keep your babies safe." <br>
''[He kisses Carl and drinks CJ's drink.]'' <br>
'''Ernesto:''' "Eh, I would have gone with a red." ''[dissapears]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' "You must stay inside. You are forbidden from going to the park!"
''[The boys scream and run away as Rosa waves her veggies.]'' <br>
''[Carlota walks in as Rosa still waves her veggies but on a hula hoop.]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' "Vete, vete, vete, Mala suerte, suerte, suerte." <br>
'''Carlota:''' "Is that my aerobics hoop?" <br>
'''Rosa:''' "It's a saging hoop now." <br>
'''Carlota:''' "Okay, cool." <br>
'''Bobby:''' "You ready to go to the mall, Carlota?" <br>
'''Ernesto:''' ''[shows up in ghost again]'' "The mall? They will be shopping for disaster! ''[dissapears]'' <br>
''[Rosa puts the hoop on Bobby and Carlota.]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' "I cannot allow you to go to the mall." ''[pulls them]'' "It's too dangerous!" <br>
'''Carlota:''' "Seriously?"
----
''[Ronnie Anne walks in.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Abuela, have you seen my skateboard? Gah!" <br>
''[Sergio records Rosa saging.]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' "I'm sorry, mija, I'm just trying to protect you." <br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Well, if you say so." ''[sees it]'' "Ooh, there it is! Good thing I found it. I'm late to meet Casey and Sameer at the movies." <br>
'''Ernesto:''' ''[shows up in ghost again]'' "The movies? That's 2 tickets to danger!" ''[eats popcorn then coughs and dissapears]'' <br>
''[Rosa blocks the door.]'' <br>
'''Rosa:''' "No one in my precious familia is going out into this cursed city!" ''[picks up wood and slipper]'' "You heard Ernesto. There are too many bad spirits out there." <br>
''[Rosa builds a wall against the door.]'' <br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[knocking on the door]'' "The door won't open! Open up! Let me in!" <br>
'''Rosa:''' "Bobby? Mijo, I told you not to go outside!" <br>
'''Sergio:''' "I got this." <br>
''[Sergio flies out the window and gets Bobby. But he won't fit inside the window and his pants get caught in the window.]'' <br>
---- 
''[Later, Sergio records them in Ronnie Anne's room.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Okay! Abuela's lost it!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I know, we have to prove the city's not cursed or we'll never leave the house again!" ''[Sees the camera]'' "Sergio! Stop filming!" ''[Covers the camera]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Compelling drama."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Abuela won't listen to us, she only listens to Ernesto Estrella."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Then we have to get him to change his mind about our city."<br>
'''Carl:''' "How are we gonna do that?" ''[Sergio does an extreme close up of Carl]'' "Ow! Easy on the zoom bird!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Wait, that's it. We make a video showing Ernesto that GLC, not only stands for Great Lakes City, but also for Good Luck City."<br>
''[Bobby's confused but Carlota, CJ, and Carl agree]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "I'll direct, and probably win awards." ''[Has a fantasy of himself accepting a golden birdie with Sancho as his bodyguard]'' "I'd like to thank my fans." ''[Squawks]'' "And my girlfriend, Priscilla. Love you, baby. We did it!" ''[Priscilla air kisses Sergio and gives him cutesy eyes. Sergio blows kisses]'' "Back at cha."<br>
''[Suddenly, Sancho grabs Sergio by the collar and shakes him. This fades to CJ doing t in the real world]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Snap out of it Sergio."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Grabs the camera]'' "Yeah, we've got some filming to do."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "First, we have to sneak out without Abuela seeing us."<br>
''[In the kitchen, Ronnie Anne grabs Lalo's pillow out from under him. In the living room, Rosa is still saging the walls, and singing, when the pillow is thrown to the ground behind her. She turns to the foul scent]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Aye, I forgot to sage Lalo's fart pillow."<br>
''[The kids and Sergio are crouched by the door]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Now's our chance." ''[Bobby unboards the door while Rosa continues to battle the fart pillow's stench]'' "Go, go, go."
----
''[In the park, Sergio and Ronnie Anne are getting ready to film]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Places everyone! City of good luck! Take one! And… Action!"<br>
''[Sancho hits the clapper. Ronnie Anne is sitting on the bench with a cotton candy]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I'm Ronnie Anne, proud citizen of Great Lakes City. Here I am enjoying some cotton candy."<br>
''[She eats it and gives a thumbs up to the camera]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Snooze fest! Not gonna win any awards." ''[To Sancho]'' "Hey, cue the cotton candy."<br>
''[Sancho presses a button and the cotton candy machine goes crazy]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Unaware]'' "As you can see... no bad luck here."<br>
'''Cotton Candy Vendor:''' ''[Grabs the camera]'' "Run for your lives! There's so much bad luck here!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne watches him run away, and then yelps as she gets buried in a cotton candy boulder. Sergio and Sancho high five]''
----
''[Later, in the mercado]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Action!"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "I'm here at Great Lakes City's finest family run mercado."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[To Sancho]'' "Cue the extras." ''[Sips his cocoa, and spits it on Sancho]'' "And I said nine marshmallows in my cocoa!"<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Unaware of Sergio's intentions]'' "A place where there's luck in every aisle. Ooh, two for one canned corn? My lucky day." ''[Just then, Sancho puts a fish in Bobby's pants and the cats storm in for it. They chase Bobby all over the mercado and Bobby hides in the dairy case. He's relieved, until he realizes that the cats are in the case too]'' "Ah! No! It's not my lucky day. Help me!"<br>
''[Sergio and Sancho chest bump]''
----
''[Later, all the kids are at the pizza place]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Anyone who thinks this city's bad luck hasn't tried our delicious pizza."<br>
''[Sergio turns the camera to the chef, who is on the phone. Sancho pops out of the dough bag and dumps it all into the oven]''<br>
'''Pizza Chef:''' "Aye! Mama Mia!"<br>
''[The whole place overloads with pizza dough. Everyone pops out]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks, joyfully]'' "Beautiful! That's a wrap people! Action! Suspense! Pizza! Movie has it all."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Angry]'' "Sergio! You did all this on purpose?! We're supposed to prove the city is safe."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Safe doesn't win awards. See ya on the red carpet."<br>
''[Flies away]''
----
''[Back at the apartment, Bobby is showing his bruises to Lori over video chat]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "These are scratches from the feral cats. And this is freezer burn from being trapped with the ice cream. Oh, and these are bruises from the pizza explosion. And I don't know why there's a fish in my pants." ''[Throws it aside]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Awe, my Boo-Boo-Bear is full of boo boos. At least your adorable nose is still intact."<br>
'''Carlota:''' "That was a total disaster."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We definitely can't ever show Ernesto or Abuela that video."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Offscreen]'' "Aye! Madre Mia! Sergio just showed me the video!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Sergio! Why?!"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Proud of my work."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Abuela, we can explain."<br>
''[Ernesto's apparition head appears on Ronnie Anne's]''<br>
'''Ernesto:''' "No! I'll explain. The bad luck has only just begun Rosa. Get out while you still can!"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ernesto's right, we are no longer safe here! The Casagrandes must leave Great Lakes City, pronto!"<br>
''[Everyone gasps in shock]''
----

===Act 2===
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Abuela, we can't just pack up and leave. Where would we even go?" <br>
'''Rosa:''' "I'm sorry, mija, but we must leave ASAP."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Bobby, I'm already home for the weekend. You guys should stay with my family. Then I could literally see your Boo-Boo Bear face in person." ''[kisses the camera]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "You hear that, abuela? Can we stay with the Louds? Please, please, please, please, please?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Really, Lori? Are you sure that's OK with your family?"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Oh, they'll be totally cool with it."
----
''[At the Loud House.]''<br>
'''Rita and Lynn Sr.:''' "We are totally not cool with it."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Come on, guys. They need our help."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Kiddo, we'd never turn our backs on the Casagrandes, but-"<br>
'''Rita:''' "There's so many of us, and so many of them, and so many of us! Maybe it would be best if we called them and-"<br>
''[The doorbell rings]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "They're here, they're here, they're here!" ''[rushes to the door]''<br>
'''Rita:''' "Of course they are."<br>
''[Lincoln opens the door]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[holding a tray of tamales]'' "Hey, Linc!"<br>
'''Casagrandes:''' "Hola, familia Loud!"<br>
''[Lalo barks and licks Lincoln.]''
----
''[The Louds and Casagrandes are together at the dinner table.]''<br>
'''Rita:''' "Rosa, Lori tells us you're in an interesting... predicament."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Yes. My astrologer Ernesto Estrella proclaimed our entire city to be cursed!"<br>
'''Lisa:''' "For the love of Einstein, everyone knows that luck is pure absurdity."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[taking a flan]'' "Sweetie, they brought flan."<br>
'''Luan:''' "''Flan''-tastic!"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Hah, good one! I'm a ''flan'' of your work!" ''[They both high-five as Lisa looks exasperated.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[blows gum]'' "Check out this gum Eiffel Tower!" ''[chews gum, then sticks out his tongue]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[nervously]'' "Oh, wow. You've gotten so much better, Lincoln."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "I've been practicing."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I hope we're not putting you out."<br>
''[Carlitos hands Rita a drawing featuring crude stick-figures of the Louds and Casagrandes surrounded by a heart.]''<br>
'''Rita:''' ''[tears up at the drawing]'' "Of course not! We totally have space for twelve extra people!"<br>
''[The Louds and Casagrandes cheer.]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Woo-hoo!"<br>
'''Lola:''' ''[to Carl]'' "Just don't touch my stuff."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Oh, I'm gonna touch it all." ''[swipes and wears Lola's tiara, Lola growls]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[he and Rosa have food at the ready]'' "Who's ready to eat?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I've missed your dad's tuna casserole!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Not as much as I've missed your abuela's tamales!"<br>
''[The Louds and Casagrandes get into a feeding frenzy, and by the time it's done, there are huge bite marks near Lincoln and Ronnie Anne's seats.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Guess we also missed dinner."<br>
----
''[Later, Ronnie Anne rushes to the bathroom.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Gotta go! Gotta go!"<br>
''[Much to her dismay, there's a really long line to the bathroom.]''<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[whips out her guitar]'' "♫''Knock, knock, knocking on the bathroom door.''♫"  ''[collapses]'' "I gotta go."<br>
''[It turns out Lori and Bobby are at the front of the line.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "No, Boo-Boo Bear. You go first."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Oh, Babe! I'd never go before you! You're my number one."<br> 
'''Lori:''' "No, you're my number one."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Well, I gotta go number two."<br>
''[Lori and Bobby prepare to kiss. Everyone else is disgusted at the cheesiness of it all, but Lynn shoves herself in front, bowling the couple over.]''<br>
'''Lynn:''' "Lynn Loud with a steal! Ooh, ooh!" ''[does a victory dance, grabs a toilet paper roll and throws it at Bobby before closing the door. She peeks back out.]'' "Wait a second, I need that." ''[takes back the toilet paper roll and heads back in. Everyone else groans.]''<br>
----
''[Ronnie Anne and CJ are brushing their teeth at the kitchen sink.]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "See? Who needs the bathroom?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yeah. We have the sink all to ourselves."<br>
''[Luna, Luan, Carl, and Lola show up and start brushing their teeth too.]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "I'm brushing here."<br>
''[Carl bumps Lola's toothbrush out of her hand.]''<br>
'''Lola:''' "My princess toothbrush! How dare you?!" ''[tackles Carl and the two start fighting]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Well, on the bright side, we don't have to sleep on the floor."
----
''[Ronnie Anne is in Lucy's bed and sandwiched between Hector and Rosa, who are snoring.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "On second thought, I'd rather sleep on the floor."<br>
'''Frida:''' "At least you're not in a coffin!"<br>
''[Frida, holding Carlitos, is in one of Lucy's coffins, and really freaked out about it. The Casagrandes are all sleeping in Lynn and Lucy's room; most of them are in coffins]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Good night. May you all sleep like the dead."<br>
''[Closes the door and Frida freaks out again]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Opens his and CJ's coffin, in a Transylvanian accent]'' "Ugh! I want to go back home."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "I think it's kind of fun. We can pretend to be the mummies of ancient pharaohs."<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Still scared]'' "You're not helping!" ''[Slams her coffin]''<br>
''[Maria, Carlota, and Lalo are in Lynn's bed; Carlota has Lalo's drool on her cheek. Maria takes the comforter and wraps it around herself.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Stop drooling on me!" ''[takes the comforter]''<br>
'''Maria:''' "Hey!"<br>
''[The two rip the comforter while fighting over it. Sergio comes over and cuddles with Carlota.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Ugh! Are you kidding me?!"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[squawks]'' "Need a snuggle."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Guys, it's been a long day. Let's just try to get some sleep."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "There's something in the coffin with me!"<br>
''[Fangs emerges from Bobby's coffin and kisses him on the cheek. Bobby shrieks and collapses in his coffin; the Casagrandes all panic]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Abuela, please. We can't stay here. It's too many people!"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mija, it might be hard, but at least we're not in Bad Luck City."<br>
''[Hector falls on Ronnie Anne, breaking a coffin.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "This is worse than bad luck."<br>
----
''[The next day. The Loud and Casagrande kids, barring Lana and Bobby, are gathered in the living room.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Ugh! We gotta find a way to end this nightmare!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "I miss my choo-choo sheets."<br>
'''Lola:''' "I miss you not being here." ''[The two start slap-fighting]'' "Stop it!"<br>
''[Lana makes a mud snowman at the foot of the stairs. Bobby heads down the stairs, but slips on the mud and sails right out the front door, disturbing a goat, a chicken, and a cow.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "I'm OK!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Well, that was bad luck. Good thing your abuela didn't see that."<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Logically speaking, you'd want her to see that. It proves that "bad luck" can happen anywhere."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Wait a minute. Lisa's right. If we can show Abuela that bad luck can happen here too, maybe she'll let us go home."
----
''[Rosa is cooking pancakes in the kitchen.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "♫''Pancakes, pancakes, making pancakes.''♫" ''[Tastes it]'' "Needs just a pinch of cinnamon." ''[Leaves. Ronnie Anne, Carl, and Luan appear with salt.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[pours salt into the pancake mix]'' "Phase 1: Code Salty."<br>
''[Later, the Louds and Casagrandes are eating the salty pancakes. The grown-ups, except for Hector and Rosa, are discomforted by the taste.]''<br>
'''Rita:''' ''[nervously]'' "Mmm. That's delicious."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[nervously]'' "I'll have to get your r-r-recipe."<br>
''[Frida is guzzling water with her pancakes, and Carlos secretly feeds his pancakes to Lalo, who then throws them up.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[tries a bite]'' "Salty pancakes? That's different."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Salty?" ''[tries a bite and spits it out]'' "Salados! Oh no. Saltiness is a sign of bad luck." ''[dashes away.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Ooh! More for me, then." ''[grabs the rest of Rosa's pancakes.]''<br>
----
''[Later, Ronnie Anne, Lincoln, Carl, and Lucy are in the basement. Lucy inserts black dye into the washing machine.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Phase 2: Code Black."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[sets the settings of the washing machine to hot.]'' "Phase 2.5: Code Shrink."<br>
''[Later, the four are in the living room when Rosa cries in shock.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "All the clothes are shrunk and turned black. This is a bad sign."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[feigning concern]'' "Oh yeah, Abuela! Really bad."<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[walking around in his shrunk and black-dyed clothes]'' "Híjole! Do I feel a breeze?" ''[Carl sighs]''
----
''[Later, Rosa enters the bathroom. Lana, CJ, and Sergio are watching and carrying wrenches, having fixed up the toilet.]''<br>
'''Lana:''' "Phase 3: Code Flush."<br>
''[Rosa flushes the toilet]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "There she goes."<br>
''[The toilet backfires and starts leaking. Rosa screams in horror.]''<br>
'''Lana:''' "And there she flows." ''[she and CJ leave the scene.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[reading a book in his coffin]'' "Frida, this book on the history of water slides is fascinating. It feels like I'm really there."<br>
''[It turns out the flood has gotten into the Casagrandes' room, and Carlos is floating by the flood.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Flood!" ''[sobs, her tears end up in the flood as Lalo fruitlessly attempts to doggy-paddle out of the flood]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "You're making it worse!" ''[his coffin and Frida on Lucy's mattress begin floating in the flood]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[comes out of the bathroom]'' "Ahh! Aye ya yi!"<br>
'''Luan:''' ''[also caught in the flood, cheering as she falls down the stairs]'' "Wahoo!"<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[fruitlessly swimming]'' "Hurry, Mama, waterfall ahead."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ay, mis bebes. Mama is coming." ''[Swims frantically and tackles Carlos, Frida, and Bobby. The flood bursts out of the Loud House, sending Luan on the tree and Hector sliding out of the door near the Casagrandes' car before spewing out water. Everyone's dazed from what just happened, Frida coughs up Walt]'' "Salty food, black laundry, floating coffins?" ''[Gasps]'' "Now I understand."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "That bad luck can happen anywhere?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Si." ''[The other Casagrande kids gasp, hopeful]'' "Anywhere we go, because we are the bad luck."<br>
''[The kids are aghast]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Wait, what?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "We must go where we can't hurt anyone. To the woods."<br>
'''CJ:''' "What!?"<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Abuela, no."<br>
'''Carl:''' "I hate nature, and nature hates me."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Can we please talk about this?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "There's no time we must pack up right away!" ''[Goes to do so]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Wow, I've never seen a plan backfire that hard before. I'll lend you my compass."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Makes herself clear with Lincoln]'' "The only way we're going to the woods is if Abuela drags us kicking and screaming."<br>
''[Outside, Bobby and Lalo are already in the back of the truck and Rosa is carrying the other kids kicking and screaming]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Carlos, do something!"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Mama, be reasonable." ''[Rosa shoots him a dirty look]'' "Oh, I hear the woods are lovely this time of year."<br>
''[Frida sighs]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Mama's boy."<br>
''[In the car, Ronnie Anne sadly presses her hand against the back window as they start to drive off. The Louds all watch the Casagrandes leave and wave goodbye.]''<br>
'''Lana:''' "Say hi to the bears."
----
''[Later, outside Flip's, the Casagrandes' are getting gas and the kids are contemplating their new lives]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "As soon as that gas tank is full, our lives are over."<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Think they have wifi in the woods?" ''[Sees her hermanos and primo roll their eyes at her. She groans]'' "Couldn't you let me live in hope?!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "May as well enjoy this last bit of civilization before we become forest people, I guess. I'm going to use a real bathroom while I still can." ''[She goes to use the bathroom but then notices a flashy, purple tour bus and a red carpet leading into the bathroom]'' "Huh? The heck is all this?"<br>
'''Ernesto:''' ''[Inside the bathroom]'' "No, no, I'm still on the road." ''[Ronnie Anne looks and sees Ernesto on the phone]'' "Oh yeah, muy bien, you have to cancel my next appearance too. Just say it's a curse again." ''[Points at a zit on his forehead]'' "Que feil! This pimple has gotten even bigger. My fans can't see me like this."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Ernest Estrella?"<br>
'''Ernesto:''' ''[Drops his phone and covers his head]'' "Oh, a fan. I love fans."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "You lied about Great Lakes City being cursed because of a pimple?!"<br>
'''Ernesto:''' "Oh, an angry fan. Estrella out!" ''[Hides in his cape]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "You're not on TV right now. That's not going to work. Thanks to you, my abuela made us leave Great Lakes City, and now she's taking us to live in the woods."<br>
'''Ernesto:''' ''[Blinks]'' "Aye, I didn't see that coming. I'm so sorry, muchacha. I never thought my words could cause so much trouble. Please, let me try to fix this."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Gets in his face]'' "You better fix this!"<br>
'''Ernesto:''' ''[Laughs, scared]'' "You're very scary for your size."

''[Inside Flip's, Frida, Rosa and Hector are getting ready to check out. When suddenly Ernesto, pimple and all, and a very annoyed Ronnie Anne appear in a puff of smoke right in front of their eyes]''<br>
'''Ernesto:''' "It is I, Ernesto Estrella, hold for applause."<br>
'''Flip:''' "Who?"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Sarcastic]'' "Oh look, it's the bo bo in person. Mucho gusto, Bo bo."<br>
'''Ernesto:''' "The universe tells me… my biggest fan may have a bad luck problem." ''[Ronnie Anne groans and turns Ernesto away from Frida and towards Rosa, who's wheezing]'' "Oh yes, there's the black cloud." ''[Waves his hand over Rosa]'' "Don't worry Miss. Estrellitas. I'm here to help. Let's cleanse the Casagrandes!" ''[Throws glitter above Rosa's head, which lands in Hector's mouth. He coughs it up. To Flip]'' "I'll need coconut oil, candlesticks, your finest sage, and jasmine incense."<br>
'''Flip:''' "We got flashlights, wilted flowers and pineapple air freshener. And you get a free flippee with that."<br>
'''Ernesto:''' "That will have to do. A free flipper? Make it cherry."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Ooh, finally some real talent to film. And action."<br>
'''Ernesto:''' "Make sure to get my good side."<br>
''[They begin the cleansing. The background changes to a distant galaxy as Ernesto swings a pineapple air freshener. Ernesto starts laughing and a female voice comes out of nowhere]''<br>
'''Female Voice:''' "Let's get cleansed."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne wears an air freshener as a necklace and waves her arms around, Carl does a robot-like dance, CJ waves wilted flower petals everywhere. All three are deadpan for this. Unlike Rosa, who is excited as Ernesto hold out an air freshener necklace. Carlota, Bobby, and Maria dance with the flashlights. Ernesto places the necklace on Rosa and spins her around to join the rest of her familia. Ernesto throws petals at Carlota, CJ, Ronnie Anne, and Carl, they're not very pleased about it]''<br>
'''Ernesto:''' "Vete!" ''[Throws petals at Rosa, Frida, Bobby and Carlitos]'' "Vete!" ''[Finally at Hector, Carlos and Maria]'' "Vete!" ''[Continues shaking the flowers]'' "Mala, suerte! Suerte! Suerte! You are all now…" ''[Claps his hands and the scene returns to normal]'' "Cleansed."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I feel it. The curse is lifted!"<br>
''[Everyone cheers]''<br>
'''Ernesto:''' "What can I say? Ernesto is the besto. Booyah!" ''[Throws another smoke bomb, which the family coughs on, and which sets off the sprinklers]'' I meant to do that."
----
''[Outside]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Thank you, Ernesto, you've saved mi familia. You truly are the besto."<br>
'''Ernesto:''' "My pleasure. Don't forget to buy several copies of my new book. Es Tu Destino."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I pre-ordered it in three languages. And I've got something for that pimple."<br>
''[Gives Ernesto some cream. Ernesto gasps and they hug. Ernesto leaves on his bus]''<br>
'''Ernesto:''' "Estrella out!"<br>
''[Rosa gets back in the car and sighs]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I feel so relieved. I told you Ernesto was wonderful."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Holds up a doll]'' "Yeah, he was okay."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Familia, I think it's time to go home." ''[Hector, CJ, Carl and Ronnie Anne cheer. They drive off, but forgot to take the gas hose out of their truck. They accidentally rip the whole pump right out of the ground as they drive away. Offscreen]'' "Oh, that could happen to anybody."
