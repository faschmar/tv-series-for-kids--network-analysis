{{Transcript}}
''[We open at the Great Lakes City Zoo, where we see that Adelaide, wearing a brown vest, is somehow driving the zoo tram. She first drives by the lions' den.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Leo, Roary, how are your sore throats?" ''[Leo and Roary roar in response.]'' "Sounding better." ''[She then drives the tram by the aquarium tank and addresses the three seals living in it.]'' "How's the water temperature, guys?" ''[The seals bark in response and then do an underwater ballet routine. Adelaide applauds this.]'' "Bravo!" ''[Her next stop is the monkeys' cage, where she informs them that it's...]'' "Lunch time!" ''[takes out some bananas and tosses them to the monkeys]'' "Banana for you, banana for you, banana for you."<br>
''[Nico suddenly jumps close to her and pokes her face with the tip of his tail, and suddenly starts speaking in a very familiar voice.]''<br>
'''Nico?:''' "Adelaide. Adelaide..."<br>
''[The scene fades to reveal Adelaide is actually standing on the living room couch with a bunch of bananas in her hands, and the preceding scene was actually just a fantasy she was having. Sid is standing nearby, poking her little sister's face with one of the bananas.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Adelaide, you're getting bananas on my junior zookeeper vest." ''[points to said vest, which is lying on the couch]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Sorry, Sid." ''[wipes the bit of banana off of Sid's vest and jumps off the couch]'' I'm just so pumped about earning my own junior zookeeper title today!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "I get it. It's pretty awesome. Mom tell you all about the sweet perks?"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Oh, you mean the free zoo snacks, unlimited tram tickets, ''and'' getting to name a baby animal? She ''may'' have mentioned it."<br>
'''Sid:''' "I hear Penny the panda is expecting."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Ooooh! I'm gonna name it Pandalaide! Eeeeee!"<br>
'''Becca''': ''[entering]'' "Remember, Adelaide. It's not just about the perks. It's about taking care of the animals' needs."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Mother, what they need is cuddles."<br>
''[Adelaide grabs a nearby couch pillow and affectionately squeezes it a little too hard, causing it to burst open and sending its feathers flying right in her mother's face.]''
----
''[Later, at the Great Lakes City Zoo, Carl is swinging from a vine as CJ stands nearby, looking up from his zoo book.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Ahhh-ah-ah-ah-ahhh! I'm a monkey!"<br>
'''CJ:''' "Monkeys don't swing on vines because..."<br>
''[Just as CJ is about to say why, Carl finds it out the hard way.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Wah-oof!"<br>
'''CJ:''' "...vines break."<br>
''[Becca and Adelaide arrive.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Carl? CJ? What are you guys doing here? Did you come to watch me become a junior zookeeper?"<br>
'''CJ:''' "I came to ''be'' one!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Oh yeah. I can't wait for those sweet perks! I'm gonna be zoo king!" ''[he laughs maniacally as he imagines himself wearing a crown and sitting on a throne as all the animals bow down to him]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "I just want to learn more about the animals."<br>
''[CJ then has a fantasy of his own, where we see him measuring an anteater's snout with measuring tape. A zebra walks up to him.]''<br>
'''Zebra:''' "Hey, you know, CJ, a group of zebras is called a dazzle."<br>
'''CJ:''' "Thank you, Mr. Zebra! ''[writing on his notepad]'' So interesting!"<br>
''[Back in reality, the Casagrande brothers sigh deeply.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Mom, you'd better break the news that ''I'm'' gonna be junior zookeeper."<br>
'''Becca:''' "Actually, sweetie, anyone can become a junior zookeeper. So you guys will be working as a team today, and hopefully you'll all earn the title. Now let's go, team!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Okay, I can do a team. And every team needs a leader. Three votes for me? Great!"<br>
'''CJ:''' "Hey, I didn't even vote!<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[pulling on another vine]'' "Yeah, you're not the boss of me!" ''[the vine suddenly pulls him up...]'' "Wahhhhhhhhhh!" ''[...and drops him back on the ground.]'' "Ow."
----
''[Later, the kids are riding with Becca in the tram]''<br>
'''Becca:''' "To become junior zookeepers, you kiddos will need to earn four badges. First up, grooming."<br>
''[Thy roll up to Bitsy's habitat, where she is giving herself a bath]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Ooh, are we gonna bathe Bitsy?"<br>
'''Becca:''' "Bitsy's has got that covered."<br>
''[Bitsy fills her trunk with water from a bucket and sprays herself like any elephant does to clean itself. The kids are amazed. Bitsy notices them looking at her and closes her shower curtain]''<br>
'''Becca:''' "Let's go see who you'll really be helping today." ''[They drive off. Later, they are at the alligator habitat, walking up to it's inhabitant]'' "Glen the Gator isn't quite as self-sufficient as our old pal Bitsy."<br>
'''Carl:''' "What do you mean? He looks clean."<br>
'''Becca:''' "Oh, Glen doesn't need a bath. He needs a good toothbrushing." ''[Glen smiles, and he really does need a toothbrushing. The kids are revolted. Becca hands them a giant toothbrush and giant tube of toothpaste and hears a trumpeting]'' "Sounds like Bitsy needs her twenty-five towels. Be back in five."<br>
''[Leaves. Carl lets the toothpaste drop and tries to open th cap]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Struggling]'' "How do you open this thing?"<br>
''[Without a warning, Adelaide jumps on the tube, squirting a jet of toothpaste that sends Carl back. Without remorse Adelaide grabs the toothbrush from CJ and takes some toothpaste off the ground]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Okay team, I got this."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Returns, covered in toothpaste]'' "Hey! I wanna hold it!"<br>
''[Gets the toothpaste off himself and tries to take the brush. He and Adelaide starts fighting over it]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Guys, work together."<br>
''[Carl and Adelaide aren't listening]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "You're supposed to brush up and down!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "No, tiny circles!"<br>
''[They don't realize that they're hitting Glen's nose with the toothbrush, Glen gets irritated. Carl and Adelaide keep fighting and end up holding the toothbrush in a position that gives CJ an idea. CJ goes over to Glen and pushes him closer. CJ maneuvers Glen back and forth along the vibrating toothbrush. Carl and Adelaide are still fighting and don't even notice]''<br>
'''Becca:''' ''[Returns]'' "Great job, everyone."<br>
''[Carl and Adelaide looks and realize that Glen's teeth are clean. Becca checks off the Grooming Badge]''
----
''[Next, Becca places buckets of food in front of the kids]''<br>
'''Becca:''' "You'll earn your feeding badge by whipping up a healthy, delicious meal for Spike and Prickly Pete." ''[Points at the two porcupines with napkins around their collars]'' "They're total foodies, so choose wisely."<br>
''[Leaves. Carl and Adelaide are each holding a bowl]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Takes the bowl Carl's holding]'' "Let's make them a salad."<br>
''[Piles the vegetables in the bowls]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "No." ''[Takes the bowls back and dumps them out]'' "Everyone knows porcupines are suckers for smoothies."<br>
''[Starts putting the fruits in the bowls and punches them into a smoothie, which splatters in Adelaide's face. Adelaide gets mad and throws a tomato at Carl. They both are mad now, they grab their arsenal and start throwing it at each other]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Guys, cut it out."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Salad!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Smoothies!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Salad!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Smoothies!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Salad!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Smoothies!"<br>
''[The porcupines get caught in the crossfire and are not happy either. They start firing their quills. CJ gasps and picks up a log in defense. He then takes two quills out and gets an idea]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "I got this. En garde!" ''[Starts catching things on the quills and gives them to Spike and Prickly Pete]'' "Lunch is served."<br>
''[The porcupines accept and eat. Becca returns while Carl and Adelaide glare at each other]''<br>
'''Becca:''' "Ooh, kabobs. Good thinking, team."<br>
'''Carl & Adelaide:''' "Huh?"<br>
''[They realize what just happened. Spike and Prickly Pete have eaten. Becca checks off the Feeding Badge]''
----
''[Later, Becca is giving them their third task]''<br>
'''Becca:''' "You're halfway through to becoming junior zookeepers."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Pandalaide, I'll be seeing you soon."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Pandalaide? I'm naming the baby panda, and his name is El Falc√≥n Jr."<br>
'''Becca:''' "The third badge is first aid. And I just noticed that poor Gregor has a quill stuck in his neck." ''[Gestures to the giraffe, who does have a quill in his neck]'' "No idea how that happened." ''[Takes out a ladder and hands it to CJ, then gives Adelaide a bandage]'' "Here's a bandage."<br>
''[Takes off again]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Nice going, Carl! It's your fault the quill got stuck."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Takes the bandage]'' "You started it!"<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Brings the ladder to Gregor]'' "Come on guys, let's work together."<br>
''[CJ leans the ladder on Gregor and they start climbing. Carl holds the bandage out, but Adelaide snatches it]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hey! Give it back!"<br>
''[They start fighting again. Suddenly the bandage falls out of their grasp. CJ manages to catch it. Carl and Adelaide are relieved]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "I got this. Hold the ladder."<br>
''[Carl and Adelaide slide back down, only to start arguing again]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "You're not holding it right."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Oh, come on."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Carl!"<br>
'''CJ:''' "Woah. Aah!"<br>
''[CJ falls]''<br>
'''Carl & Adelaide:''' "Oh, no, CJ!"<br>
''[Suddenly, Connie the Condor catches CJ]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Thanks, Connie! Can I get a boost?"<br>
''[Connie takes CJ to the quill in Gregor's neck. CJ takes it out and puts the bandage on. Carl and Adelaide sigh with relief]''<br>
'''Becca:''' ''[Suddenly returns]'' "Good job, kids."<br>
''[Checks off the First Aid Badge]''
----
''[Becca is giving them their final assignment]''<br>
'''Becca:''' "Last badge, habitat maintenance."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Awesome! I'm great at that. Uh, what is that?"<br>
'''Becca:''' "It means you'll be building a home for one of our new and endangered animals Lois the Galapagos Tortoise."<br>
'''CJ:''' "She's beautiful."<br>
'''Becca:''' "Yes she is, CJ. And she needs a special habitat to thrive." ''[Lois agrees. Becca gestures to two piles of bamboo and stones]'' "Here are some building materials." ''[Goes to the gate]'' "Okay, good luck. Be back in a sec. Oh and keep this gate closed. Lois likes to run out."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "As group leader, I say we use bamboo for the base of the shelter."<br>
'''Carl:''' "No way, we should use rocks."<br>
''[Picks up an armload of rocks]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Having had enough of Carl]'' "Fine, then I'm doing my own habitat."<br>
''[Picks up some bamboo, which is really heavy for her, and accidentally smacks the rocks out of Carl's hands]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hey! Watch it!" ''[A rock goes flying and opens the gate. The kids don't notice. Adelaide drops the heavy piece and goes for another one]'' "Let's see which one Lois likes better."<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Groans]'' "Either way, she'll need shade. I'll get some leaves. Keep an eye on Lois."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Not keeping an eye on Lois]'' "Mine's gonna be a castle with a moat so you can't come in!"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Not seeing Lois walk behind him]'' "Oh, yeah? Mine's gonna be a fortress! With a 'No Adelaides Allowed' sign!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Mine has three bedrooms and a walk-in closet. Bam-boom!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Yeah? Well, mine has four pools, a hot tub and a wave pool! Which is so much cooler, right, Lois?"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Realizes that she and Carl are the only ones here]'' "Lois? You scared her off with all your pools."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hello, she's right there."<br>
''[Points to a turtle shaped stone]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Drops her bamboo]'' "That's not Los, that's a rock!"<br>
''[They then notice that the gate is open. Carl gasps in shock]''<br>
'''Carl & Adelaide:''' ''[Search around their building supplies]'' "Lois? Lois?"<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Returns and already knows what happened]'' "Let me guess. You were so busy fighting you forgot to watch Lois."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[In unison]'' "It's his fault!"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[In unison]'' "It's her fault!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Oh, who are we kidding!? It's both our faults. We'll never be junior zookeepers now."<br>
'''CJ:''' "Guys, we have to find Lois."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "You're right. What's the plan, CJ?"<br>
'''CJ:''' "We have to work together. Can you do that? For Lois?"<br>
''[Carl and Adelaide look at each other, and smile]''<br>
'''Carl & Adelaide:''' "Let's do it!"
----
''[Later, Carl and Adelaide are holding the ladder against Gregor again. CJ climbs up and looks through a pair of binoculars]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Hmm‚Ä¶ If only I could get a little higher." ''[Gregor picks up CJ and puts him on his head]'' "Thanks, Gregor!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[To Carl]'' "You're actually doing a pretty good job of holding that side, Carl."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Thanks, you're not doing too bad yourself, Adelaide."<br>
''[CJ looks through the binoculars and sees Lois getting on the zoo tram]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "I see her! Oh, no, she's on the tram!" ''[Someone left some cabbage on the driver's seat. Lois eats one but accidentally knocks another one onto the accelerator. The tram speeds off]'' "Ah! Runaway tram!"<br>
''[Carl and Adelaide see the tram]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "It's going too fast. We need to stop it!"<br>
''[Carl looks around, and notices Spike and Prickly Pete]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "I know what to do."
----
''[The kids watch from the porcupine habitat. The tram is still speeding in their direction, Lois too busy eating to notice]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Holds up a porcupine]'' "Ready‚Ä¶"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Holds up the other porcupine]'' "Aim‚Ä¶<br>
'''CJ:''' "Fire."<br>
''[Spike and Prickly Pete shoot their quills to form a spike strip in the tram's path. The front tires pop and Lois goes flying, the kids gasp. Lois lands in the alligator habitat right on top of Glen, waking him up. Lois bounces off Glen and lands next to the giant toothbrush, which is propped up on a rock. Glen sees Lois, Lois knows what Glen is thinking, and so does Adelaide]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Glen's going to eat Lois!" ''[The kids jump into the alligator habitat and go to Lois]'' "Lois! We got you!"<br>
''[She and Carl try to pick up Lois but they can't]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Lois weighs two-hundred pounds."<br>
''[Meanwhile, Glen has his napkin ready]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Come on, Lois! You gotta run! Go, Lois, go!" ''[Lois gets to her feet and tries to run, but she's still a tortoise and can't go very fast]'' "You have to go faster than that!"<br>
''[Glen's clean teeth are snapping and go goes towards them, much faster than Lois can run. Lois manages to get on one end of the giant toothbrush]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "I know, come on!" ''[Goes to the other end of the toothbrush]'' "Guys, jump on the brush." ''[Glen is getting closer, Lois shrieks]'' "On three. One, two, three!"<br>
''[The kids jump on the other end of the toothbrush and launch Lois away just in the nick of time. Lois' shell goes flying and lands safely back in her habitat. Lois comes out, dazed]''<br>
'''Kids:''' "We did it! Yay!"
----
''[Later on. The kids are finishing Lois' habitat]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "That roof looks awesome, CJ."<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Putting the last of the leaves on the roof]'' "Thanks. Nice deck, Carl."<br>
'''Car:''' ''[Finishing with the rocks]'' "Thanks, hermano! That walk-in closet really sells it, Adelaide!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Putting up the last bamboo rod]'' "Couldn't have done it without my team!"<br>
''[Lois opens the curtain with a bejewelled shell and sunglasses, she then closes and opens the curtain with a spikey shell fuschia mohawk and eye shadow, then closes and opens the curtain again this time with red and yellow sneakers and hat, some bling and LOIS graffitied on her shell. Becca finally returns, having no clue how they all got here]''<br>
'''Becca:''' "Love your new place, Lois. You guys did a great job."<br>
''[Lois' home is amazing]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "It was a group effort!"<br>
''[Becca checks off the Habitat Badge]''
----
''[Later, CJ, Carl and Adelaide all have their vests]''<br>
'''Becca:''' "You're all officially junior zookeepers. And now for your first task, naming the baby panda."<br>
''[The panda comes out of its carriage]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Pandalaide!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "El Falc√≥n Jr!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Actually, why don't we let CJ decide?"<br>
''[CJ goes over to the panda, picks it up, and it immediately soils its diaper]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Ooh. I think I'll call him Se√±or Stinky!"<br>
'''Becca:''' "Your next task is changing him."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Revolted]'' "Ugh, I'm outta here." ''[grabs a vine and tries to swing away. Only for the vine to break again. Carl lands facefirst just a few feet away]'' "I meant to do that."
