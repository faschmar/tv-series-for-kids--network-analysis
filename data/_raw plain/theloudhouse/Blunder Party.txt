''[It's night time in Great Lakes City, on the roof of the Casagrandes' apartment building there are many strung lights on.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' “The roof looks amazing Ronnie Anne, I love the camping theme.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Thanks, Sid, I'm kinda nervous, it's the first time I'm hosting a big slumber party.”<br>
'''Sid:''' “Just think of it like a s'more.” ''[Holds up a disassembled s'more.]'' “You're great at sleeping and you're great at parties, mash them together and you get…” ''[Does so with her s'more and eats.]'' “Greatest slumber party ever.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne eats her own s'more, and does a handshake with her best friend.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “The perfect combo, just like us.” ''[To her guests]'' “You guys finished setting up your tents yet?”<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Dangling from his tent.]'' “Not exactly.”<br>
'''Nikki:''' ''[Pops out of her tent.]'' “Define finished.”<br>
'''Casey:''' ''[Laying in a hammock.]'' “Define tent.”<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Comes out from under a cardboard box.]'' “Nailed it.”<br>
''[Everyone laughs. Just then, Sancho arrives with pizza.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Ooh, Sancho's here with the pizza.”<br>
''[Everyone runs over to the table. Sancho coos at Ronnie Anne and she gives him a half-eaten pretzel as payment. They all enjoy the pizza when suddenly...]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Who ordered thin crust?"<br>
''[Everyone turns around and sees that they have party crashers.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “Got any with pineapples?”<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Smugly]'' “So, uh, where do we set up our tents?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Uh, Carl, Adelaide, can I speak to you over here?” ''[Take them off to the side.]'' “Sorry guys, the slumber party's just for me and my friends, we're doing big kid stuff.”<br>
''[At the table, Sameer is holding a pizza slice in his mouth and Casey stretches it as far as he can. Laird measures it with a tape measure.]''<br>
'''Laird:''' “Fifteen feet.”<br>
''[Casey lets the pizza go and it retracts into Sameer's face. The girls applaud.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Amateurs, I could beat that in my sleep.”<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “Yeah, watch.”<br>
''[Adelaide puts a slice in her mouth and Carl stretches it, but it gets flung and takes down a pigeon which lands and gets stuck in Laird's hair.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Walks up]'' “Sorry Adelaide, big kids only.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' Maybe next time?”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Or… this time.” ''[Clears his throat, and proceeds to wail.]'' “ABUELA!!! RONNIE ANNE WON'T LET US CAMP ON THE ROOF WITH HER!!!”<br>
''[He shouts so loud pigeons fly away and it echoes. Adelaide and Carl sneer as Rosa appears behind Sid and Ronnie Anne.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Ronalda!” ''[The girls yelp]'' “You must always include others, especially tu familia.” ''[Carl and Adelaide agree.]'' “Let them stay for a little while, at least until they go to bed.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Sighs]'' “Fine.” ''[To Carl and Adelaide]'' “You can join the party.”<br>
''[Carl and Adelaide happily do so, and the pigeon continues dragging Laird.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' “Don't worry Ronnie Anne, sometimes s'mores have extra ingredients. Like pizza.”<br>
''[Holds up a s'more with a pizza slice in the middle and eats it.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “I do love pizza.”
----
''[Later, Sameer is telling a scary story.]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' “It was a dark and stormy night... ” ''[Makes a shadow puppet on the white sheet.]'' “..and the butler was nowhere to be found.”<br>
''[Suddenly two extra shadows pop up.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Oh! Oh! This is the one where he's buried in the wall.”<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “And tries to eat his way out.”<br>
'''Carl & Adelaide:''' “Cause he's a zombie.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne, Sid, Casey, and Nikki groan.]''<br>
'''Laird:''' “A zombie!”<br>
'''Sameer:''' “It's cool, I have a scarier story.” ''[Makes another, rather impressive, shadow puppet.]'' “The Tale of the Cursed Highway. It was a darker stormier night...”<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Interrupts]'' “And the hitch-hiker has a hook for a hand.”<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “Next.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne, Sid, Casey, and Nikki groan again.]''<br>
'''Laird:''' “Sharp appendages.”<br>
'''Sameer:''' “Okay, those are the only two I memorized. I'm just gonna wing it here.” ''[Thinks]'' “Ooh, I got one.” ''[Starts the puppets]'' ”The Tale of the-”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Ghost spiders!”<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “Next!<br>
''[Ronnie Anne, Sid, Casey, and Nikki groan again.]''<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Hiding behind them]'' “Is the scary part over?”<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Gives up]'' “I can't work like this, we're out.”<br>
''[Sameer leaves, followed by his shadow puppets.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[To Ronnie Anne]'' “Don't worry, I've got this, they can't ruin a dance party.”
----
''[Later, Sid turns on a radio and dons her Yoon Kwan shades, the big kids dance, Laird struggles a little, suddenly the k-pop music is changed to classical.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Hops in]'' "And now for the ''Frog Lake'' ballet."<br>
'''Sid:''' “Adelaide. it's K-pop time.”<br>
'''Carl:''' “No, it's Carl time, DJ Carl! ''[Carl starts a soundtrack that consists of flatulent noises.]'' I made this track myself, It's Called "Abuelo's Farts" The Remix!”<br>
[Everyone just looks at Carl, and are rather disturbed by the music.]<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Grabs the radio]'' "Carl, no! Ballet!"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Fights with Adelaide over the radio.]'' "Farts!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Ballet!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Farts!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Ballet!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Farts!"<br>
''[Adelaide and Carl keep playing tug of war over the radio until it flies out of their hands, hits Laird, and breaks. Everyone looks at them, annoyed, and Laird coughs up a CD.]''
----
''[Later, a concoction is made from ketchup, pickles, guacamole, and a s'more.]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' “New game, who dares to drink my mystery juice?”<br>
''[Holds it up as the big kids are revolted.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Takes it]'' “You guys are wimps, give me that.” ''[Drinks. And spits it out. Carl shakes the taste out of his mouth and realizes that he spit it on Laird, the big kids are more revolted, but Adelaide laughs.]''<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Sniffs his arm]'' “Is this dill? I hate dill.”<br>
''[Sid and Ronnie Anne go off to the side.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' “Okay, it's bad, they've got to go.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “We can't kick them out, they'll go to Abuela. We need to keep them busy and out of our way.” ''[They think]'' “Oh, I've got it.” ''[Ronnie Anne takes out a marker and some paper. They return to the others.]'' “Hey guys, time for a scavenger hunt, whoever collects all the items on the list wins a super s'more.”<br>
'''Carl & Adelaide:''' ''[Liking the sound of that.]'' “A super s'more?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Carl and Adelaide, you can be on one team.”<br>
''[The little kids grab the list and make a run for it.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “Let's get a head start.”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Suckers!”<br>
''[The other run up to the girls.]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' “Hurry Ronnie Anne! What are the other teams?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “There are no other teams. Now we can have some real fun.”<br>
'''Casey:''' ''[In unison. Laughs]'' “Ooh, gotcha.”<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[In unison]'' “Good thinking.”<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Kind of bummed]'' “Oh, but I love scavenger hunts.” ''[Drinks, then spits Nikki's mystery juice all over her and the guys, they give him dirty looks.]'' “Yup, it was dill.”
----
''[Meanwhile, Carl and Adelaide are talking to Mr. Nakamura.]''<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' “You need to borrow my favorite sweater-vest for a scavenger hunt? Happy to help, be right back.” ''[Goes into his apartment.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “We'll be feasting on that super s'more in no time.”<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “Fastest scavenger hunt ever.”<br>
''[Suddenly a very long rack full of sweater-vests emerges from Mr. Nakamura's apartment.]''<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' “Here we go. Now, which one is my favorite?” ''[Picks two up]'' “I'll have to try them all on.”<br>
''[Hugs the two he's holding, the kids groan. Back on the roof, Laird is showing the others his telescope.]''<br>
'''Laird:''' “The Cosmos Five-thousand is so powerful, that you can see Saturn's rings.”<br>
'''Casey:''' ''[Points the telescope at the street.]'' “And Bobby.”<br>
''[On the streets, Bobby is taking a box of mangos from Par, but slips on one, accidentally flinging the box in Par's face, and slides away. Par gets the box off his face and goes after Bobby. The kids laugh.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[High-fives Ronnie Anne.]'' “I knew this would be a great slumber party.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Oh, we're just getting started.”<br>
''[On the stairs, Carl and Adelaide finally got Mr. Nakamura's favorite sweater-vest, and Carl is reading the next item.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Now we have to get… Abuelo's longest nose hair? Ah! Gross!”<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Thinking about their s'more]'' “It'll be worth it.”<br>
''[They go down, and Bobby slides up, he slides off-screen, then returns and continues sliding up the stairs. Meanwhile, Hector is napping, one nose hair sticking out of his nostril. Carl has bolt cutters, he moves really slowly and cuts the hair. Carl and Adelaide high-five. Back on the roof, the kids are playing Froot Tangle.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' “Right-hand apple.” ''[Ronnie Anne does so]'' “Left elbow grape.” ''[Casey does so]'' “Right toe on orange.”<br>
''[Laird tries to reach, and extends his unusually long leg, making the landing. The kids start trembling, except Sid who is effortlessly standing on one finger, and they all drop. Everyone laughs. Meanwhile, in Ronnie Anne's room, Carl and Adelaide peer inside, Sergio is sleeping with a box of crackers. The kids sneak up on him, and together they swipe the box.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “Sergio's crackers, got it.”<br>
''[Suddenly a falcon noise and a dark shadow covers them, they look up and see Sergio awake.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks, angry]'' “Snack thieves!” ''[Carl and Adelaide panic. Carl goes to the door and Adelaide throws him the box. Sergio goes to Carl who throws the box back to Adelaide, they make a run for the door.]'' “Get back here!”<br>
''[Sergio charges, but the kids slam the door on him and he gets stuck. Carl and Adelaide high-five again and smirk at the parrot. Back on the roof, the kids are making a pyramid. Laird climbs over Casey.]''<br>
'''Casey:''' “Hey! Watch it!”<br>
''[Laird makes it to the top.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Okay Laird! Here it comes!”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne throws a popcorn kernel at Laird. He tries to catch it in his mouth, but it lands in his hair, prompting another pigeon to attack him. In Carlota's room, she is innocently applying mascara and doesn't notice her hermano being lowered down on a rope behind her, next to a picture on her wall. Carl presses the eye on the photo and a secret compartment opens up, revealing the next scavenger hunt item, Carlota's diary, Carl grabs it, pulls on the rope, and gets lifted away without his hermana's knowledge. Meanwhile, on the roof, the kids are having a cupcake decorating contest.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[To Nikki]'' “That's a nine.”<br>
'''Nikki:''' “Sweet!”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[To Laird]'' “That's an eight.”<br>
'''Laird:''' “Yeah!”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Noticing Casey's lack of any cupcakes.]'' “Casey, where's your cupcake?” ''[Casey takes his out, and then a spring launches it into Ronnie Anne's face.]'' “Cupcake fight!”<br>
''[The kids start throwing cupcakes at each other. Sid and Ronnie Anne get together.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Best slumber party ever!"<br>
----
''[Meanwhile, in the mercado, Bobby slides past the produce, and then Carl and Adelaide walk up to it.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “And the last on the list... A mango that looks like Vito?”<br>
''[He and Adelaide look inside where the mangoes are usually kept.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “Where are the mangoes?”<br>
''[The bin is empty, save for a note that reads: 'you're out of mangoes 💋 ♥️ Maybelle'. Par is just leaving the mercado.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Hey, there's Par, maybe he has some in his truck.”<br>
''[He and Adelaide go to see. Back on the roof, the kids are trying different salsas.]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' “The roasted jalapeño is definitely my fave.”<br>
'''Sameer:''' “I didn't even know you could make salsa from pineapples.”<br>
'''Sid:''' “They're all my favorite.”<br>
'''Casey:''' “Ooh, I could eat this forever.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Calls from downstairs]'' “Carl! Adelaide! Time to get ready for bed!”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Calls down]'' “Oh, uh, they're just… trying out different salsas, they'll be down in a minute.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “What a good prima.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “That's what family's for.” ''[Returns to her friends]'' “Okay, I better go get Carl and Adelaide.”<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Offscreen]'' “Isn't that them?” ''[Looking through the telescope]'' “Huh, looks like they're getting into Par's delivery truck.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Looks]'' “What?!” ''[On the street, Adelaide and Carl are indeed getting in the back of the truck. Par starts the truck up.]'' “We have to stop him.”<br>
'''Sid:''' “But, what if your abuela comes back?”<br>
'''Sameer:''' “Don't worry, you guys go, I'll stay here and stall her.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne commends him and she, Sid, Nikki, Casey, and Laird head downstairs, leaving Sameer a bowl of salsa.]''<br>
'''Casey:''' ''[Takes one more chip]'' “One for the road.”<br>
''[On the street, Par drives off, just as the kids arrive.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Ugh! We just missed him.”<br>
'''Nikki:''' “Do you know where he's headed?”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne's hermano slides up and stops in front of them.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “No, but Bobby does.” ''[To Bobby]'' “Bobby, where's Par's next stop?”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “Par-dawg? He usually takes the old fruit to the city dump.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “The city dump?”<br>
''[The kids freak out and go after Par, while Bobby resumes sliding. The kids run through the streets, accidentally making Sancho drop his pizza delivery, many pigeons start fighting over the dropped pizza, and Sancho gets in on this. Back on the roof of the building, Rosa walks up.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Carl, Adelaide.”<br>
''[Rosa sees the silhouettes of the kids dancing behind the white sheet.]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Through Carl's silhouette]'' “Five more minutes, Abuela.” ''[Through Adelaide's silhouette]'' “Please?”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Okay, since you're having so much fun.”<br>
''[Rosa leaves, and Sameer comes out from behind the sheet, having created the illusion with his very big hair.]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' “Whew! We did it, guys.”<br>
''[Sameer high fives with the hair puppet of himself. Meanwhile, Par leaves the dump just as the kids arrive. They enter and start searching.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Carl!”<br>
'''Sid:''' “Adelaide!” ''[Just then, another load of garbage is dropped on all of them. Casey, Nikki, and Laird come out, and Ronnie Anne and Sid pop out from another pile a distance away.]'' “They're not here!”<br>
'''Casey:''' “They could be ''anywhere''.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “We never should have sent them on the scavenger hunt.”<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Finds an old teddy bear]'' “Hey, it's not a total loss. At least I found my old friend Mr. Scruffles.” ''[Just then a rat comes out of Mr. Scruffles' face. Laird drops him.]'' “Ah! You've changed.” ''[The rat takes the bear away.]'' “But I still love you.”
----
''[Back at the apartment, Hector is still napping and the kids run up to Rosa.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Abuela, I need your help. I messed up and now Carl and Adelaide are lost in the city.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Que? But they're right here.”<br>
''[Carl and Adelaide are in fact standing in the living room right behind them.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Carl!”<br>
'''Sid:''' “Adelaide!”<br>
''[They run up and hug their primo and <abbr title="younger sister">mèimei</abbr>. Carl and Adelaide have no idea why they're being hugged, but they smell Ronnie Anne and Sid and push them away.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “You guys smell like garbage.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “How did you get back? We thought Par drove off with you.”<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “Nope, he just gave us a mango.” ''[Shows the mango]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Check it out.” ''[Talks through the mango]'' “Hey, I'm Vito. How's you's doin'?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Laughs]'' “That does look like Vito.”<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Gives it to Ronnie Anne]'' “That's everything on the list.” ''[Takes out everything else]'' “Where's our giant s'more?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Sorry guys, I made up the scavenger hunt to get rid of you.”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Get rid of us? But we were the best part of your lame sleepover.”<br>
'''Adelaide:''' “''Well'', we did ruin the scary stories, and the dance party, and…”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Okay, okay, maybe we weren't the best part.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Abuela, I know it's late, but can they come back to the party? I owe them a giant s'more.”<br>
''[Adelaide and Carl happy hop in excitement.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Si, Ronalda, but just for a little longer.”<br>
''[The kids excitedly run off, throwing the mango on Hector, who wakes up and sees it.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Thinking it's the real Vito.]'' “Ah! Vito! What happened!? Speak to me!”
----
''[Back on the roof, everyone is enjoying their s'mores. Ronnie Anne comes up to Carl and Adelaide.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Alright, one super s'more as promised.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne holds up a s'more that's bigger than they are. Carl and Adelaide gasp in delight as Ronnie Anne drops the s'more on top of them. They pop out, loving it.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' “Best slumber party ever!”<br>
''[The kids continue their fun.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Slides by]'' “You can say that again.”
