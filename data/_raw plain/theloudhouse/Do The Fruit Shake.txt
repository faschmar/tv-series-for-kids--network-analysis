''[At the Casagrande apartment, Carl is looking through an old box]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Nope! No! No!"<br>
''[Continues throwing record all over the place, almost hitting his padre]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "I see you've taken an interest in my vintage record collection."<br>
'''Carl:''' "I've gotta find a cool song to remix. DJ Carl's playing at the block party and needs a new hit."<br>
''[Carl continues tossing records, and Carlos continues dodging them. Carlos catches one record]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "What about this one? It's always made an impact on me."<br>
''[Carl gives it a second look]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Tropical Fruits? Never heard of them, I'll give it a spin."<br>
''[Puts the record on, disco music plays]''<br>

''[At the block party, Carl plays a remix of the track]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Give it up for the Fruit Shake remix."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "This song rules."<br>
'''CJ:''' "Check it out, Ronnie Anne." ''[Shakes his butt]'' "I'm doing the fruit shake."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne copy's him]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hey, I think I got it, CJ."<br>
''[Sergio, Sancho and Lalo all join in]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Do the fruit shake like a superstar. A remix from DJ Carl." ''[Throws tropical fruits to the crowd]'' "Drop it like it's hot."<br>
''[The crowd loves the remix and start taking selfies with Carl]''<br>
'''Larry Funkman:''' "DJ Carl." ''[A man cuts through the crowd]'' "Baby, love the song, love the fruit. Name's Larry Funkman."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Gasps, and shoves the crowd away]'' "Did you just say you were Larry Funkman? A.K.A the hit making record exect?"<br>
'''Sergio:''' "A.K.A the million-dollar man?"<br>
'''Larry Funkman:''' "I sure am, and I want to produce your song and put the fruit shake remix on the radio, I want to make you a star, baby"<br>
'''Carl:''' "A star?"<br>
''[Faints into Sergio's wings, having a fantasy about rocking a huge stadium]''<br>
'''Fantasy Crowd:''' "DJ Carl! DJ Carl! DJ Carl!"<br>
''[End of fantasy, Sergio is waving cash in front of Carl's face]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey."<br>
''[Carl wakes up]''<br>
'''Larry Funkan:''' "I can't believe The Tropical Fruits gave you permission to use that song. I've been trying to get that for years now."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Sweating, knowing he doesn't have permission]'' "Uh‚Ä¶ There‚Ä¶ Yes, of course they did."<br>
'''Larry Funkman:''' "Great, because you can't use the song otherwise. Be in my recording studio tomorrow at noon. And have a funky day baby."<br>
''[Larry leaves]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Angrily groans, and grabs Sergio]'' "What am I gonna do?"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Annoyed squawk]'' "Retire?"<br>
'''Carl:''' "But this remix could be my first big hit."<br>
''[Throws the bird away]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Maybe we can find the fruits!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "They could be anywhere. Wait a second, sounds like a job for Detective Carl!"<br>
''[Dons his fedora]''
----
''[Later, Carl is interrogating someone]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Puts the record on the table]'' "Tell me about The Tropical Fruits. Where are they now?"<br>
''[Carlos is the one there questioning, eating a torta.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Gulps his sandwich]'' "Can I finish eating first?"<br>
''[Sergio grabs the torta and holds it over Lalo's mouth]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Start talking or the torta gets it."<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Studders]'' "Their names are Pi√±a, Papaya, and Mango. They recorded ‚ÄòDo the Fruit Shake', then vanished."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Likely story, Sergio."<br>
''[Sergio starts shaking bits of the torta into Lalo's mouth]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Wait! Wait! Pi√±a still performs at a restaurant in the city."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Snapping]'' "What restaurant? I need answers."<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Hesitant]'' "Uh, the Fun Bowl? No, no, something with fruit." ''[Thinks]'' "The Fruit Bowl, that's it. The Fruit Bowl."<br>
'''Carl:''' "''Now'' we're talking. Sergio, give the man his torta."<br>
''[Sergio tosses whats left of the torta to Carlos]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Hey! There's nothing but bread."
----
''[Later, at The Fruit Bowl, the boys and animals are looking for Pi√±a. Suddenly the stage lights go on. The giant pineapple opens up revealing the lady Carl's looking for. Pi√±a plays her guitar]''<br>
<center>'''Pi√±a:'''<br>
''üéµ "Tu eres mi pi√±a.''<br>
''Mira mi cocina.''<br>
''Ooh, la pi√±a perfecta.''<br>
''Offer me and you bet'cha."üéµ''</center>
''[Finishes the song. The crowd cheers]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "There's Pi√±a."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "She's still got it."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Let's go chat her up."<br>
''[Pi√±a takes her seat, with a pineapple platter]''<br>
'''Waiter:''' "Can I help you?"<br>
'''Carl:''' "I just have to talk to that lady."<br>
'''Waiter:''' "Ms. Pi√±a prefers to be left in peace after her performance. Now please‚Ä¶"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Grabs Pi√±a's pineapple]'' "Anyone gonna eat this? No? Don't mind if I do."
''[Sergio flies away with the pineapple. The Waiter chases him]''<br>
'''Waiter:'''  "Pesky parrot."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Sits with Pi√±a]'' "Hi! I'm DJ Carl, big fan, love what you've got going on."<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' "Oh, such a sweet nene."<br>
'''Carl:''' "I've got a problem though. I need your permission to record a remix of 'Do the Fruit Shake'."<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' "Is this another one of Papaya's pranks?" ''[Scoffs]'' "She's always getting me."<br>
'''Carl:''' "No! I played it live and everyone flipped out. See for yourself."<br>
''[Shows Pi√±a the video from the block party]''<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' ''[Loving it]'' "Oh, que fantastico. I love it. Why of course you can have my permission."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Takes out a pen and paper]'' "Great, just sign this. And do you know where the other fruits are?"<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' "Mango? Can't help you there. We haven't spoken in many, many years. But I know Papaya's address."<br>
'''Sergio:''' "We gotta scram!"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[He and the other run out]'' "Thanks Pi√±a."<br>
'''Waiter:''' ''[Still chasing them]'' "Get back here!"<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' "Bye!"<br>
----
''[Later, they are at Papaya's place]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "So all you have to do is sign here, Ms. Papaya."<br>
'''Papaya:''' ''[Gives the paper back]'' "Sorry, dear, I can't be bothered with all this. I have a piano to move and my movers just cancelled on me."<br>
''[Carl looks at the others and CJ rolls up his sleeve.]''
----
''[Later, they are lifting the piano up the stairs, but are struggling to do so]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "My back."<br>
'''CJ:''' "So heavy."<br>
''[Suddenly, Sergio gets a phone call]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Takes the call]'' "Qu√© onda, Sancho? Oh just chillin'."<br>
''[The boys and Lalo fall down the stairs.]''
----
''[Later, they are back outside panting next to Papaya.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Takes the paper out again]'' "Okay, we got it up there. So what do you say?"<br>
'''Papaya:''' ''[Signs]'' "I suppose the deal's a deal."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Thanks. Do you know where we can find Mango?"<br>
'''Papaya:''' "Oh, I'm afraid we had a bit of a falling out, dear. I haven't heard from her in years." ''[The boys and Lalo groan. Papaya offers them a snack]'' "Papaya?"<br>
''[Carl, CJ, and Lalo each take one. Meanwhile, Sergio's finally run out of stuff to talk about]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Alright, Sancho talk to you later." ''[Hangs up, to the angry boys]'' "Now where's this piano?"<br>
''[Lalo stuffs his papaya into Sergio's beak]''
----
''[Back at the mercado, the gang is having a paleta break]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "We'll never find Mango! Think, Detective Carl."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Offscreen, singing to herself]'' "Add a little mango and papaya twist..."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Groans]'' "We're so close‚Ä¶"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Come on down‚Ä¶"<br>
'''Carl:''' "I can practically hear Mango singing."<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Realizes]'' "Wait, I hear her too."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Passes by, holding a mango]'' "Do the fruit shake."
''[The boys all gasp]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Wait a minute."<br>
''[Looks at Mango on the album cover and at Maybelle]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Do the fruit shake. Do the fruit shake. Do the fruit shake."<br>
''[The boys gasp again and go to Maybelle]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Maybelle? You're Mango from The Tropical Fruits?"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "I haven't been called that name in years."<br>
''[The boys all cheer]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Can I get permission to use ‚ÄòDo the Fruit Shake' for my remix?"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Nope."<br>
'''Carl:''' "What? Why not?"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Mad]'' "I can't stand that song."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Then why are you singing it?"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Because you played it at that block party and now it's stuck in my head. But it brings back too many bad memories. Let me take you back to the days of disco, the nineteen-seventies."<br>
''[Spins her mango on her finger, which fades into a disco ball from back in the day]''<br>
'''Crowd:''' "Tropical Fruits! Tropical Fruits!"<br>
'''Mango:''' "Our new song is out of sight, girls. We're gonna be the biggest thing since sliced mangoes." ''[Her bandmates are super excited]'' "Speaking of which, where's my pre-show mango?"<br>
''[Pi√±a and Papaya snicker]''<br>
'''Papaya:''' "I haven't seen it."<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' "Don't look at me... uh‚Ä¶ what?"<br>
'''Mango:''' "This better not be another one of your pranks, you know I need it to calm my nerves."<br>
'''Stagehand:''' "Ladies, you're on. Sock it to ‚Äòem."<br>
''[The Tropical fruits take the stage. But Mango is very nervous]''<br>
'''Mango:''' "Uh‚Ä¶ Good evening, we're the... uh... We're The Tropical Toots. Uh, wait, no." ''[Everyone laughs at her, she turns to her bandmates angry]'' "I told you I needed that mango. I'm sick of all this prankin'!"<br>
''[Runs away in tears. Pi√±a and Papaya look at each other with remorse. End of flashback]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "I've never been more embarrassed. Thanks for reminding me."<br>
''[Exits the mercado. Bobby has tears in his eyes]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Grabs Sergio]'' "Saddest story I've ever heard."<br>
''[Blows his nose into Sergio]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "We've just got to get Pi√±a and Papaya to say they're sorry. Then Maybelle will give me permission."<br>
'''CJ:''' "But how will we get them together?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[To a customer]'' "Oh, hi. These oranges are fifty percent off." ''[Leans on them, knocking them over]'' "Make that sixty percent."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hey, that gives me an idea." ''[The boys run out]'' "Thanks, Bobby."<br>
''[Bobby gives them a thumbs up]''
----
''[Later, Pi√±a and Papaya are still where they were all day, eating pineapple and papaya, respectively. The waiter brings a tray to Pi√±a, revealing Carl. At the same time Sergio, dressed as a postage bird, approaches Papaya]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[To Pi√±a]'' "Big pineapple sale at the Casagrande mercado."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[To Papaya]'' "Big papaya sale at the Casagrande mercado."<br>
'''Carl & Sergio:''' "Be there at five p.m. on the dot."<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' "Que fabuloso!"<br>
'''Papaya:''' "Ooh, you got it, Birdman."<br>
''[Carl and Sergio high-five, from their respective places.]''
----
''[Meanwhile, Maybelle is sitting on a park bench, eating her mango. The boys pop out of a bush]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Good thing I've been practicing my handwriting."<br>
''[Carl turns on a drone and flies it forward. Maybelle sees something]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Huh?" ''[Reads Carl's skywriting]'' "''Mango sale‚Ä¶ Casagrande Mercado. Five p.m. sharp''. I'm there."<br>
''[The boys all high-five]''
----
''[Almost five o'clock at the mercado]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Looking at his watch]'' "Three‚Ä¶ Two‚Ä¶ One."<br>
''[Pi√±a enters followed by Papaya]''<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' "I'm here for the pineapple sale!"<br>
'''Papaya:''' "Now where are all these papayas?"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Enters]'' "Give me all the mangoes you got."<br>
''[Pi√±a and Papaya know that voice and turn around gasping]''<br>
'''Papaya:''' "Mango?"<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' "Aye bendito, is that you chica?"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Huh?" ''[Not pleased to see them]'' "What are you two doing here?"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Nonchalant]'' "‚ÄòWhat a coincidence, it's a Tropical Fruits reunion. Hey, got any old beefs you want to settle?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Whispers to himself from behind the oranges]'' "Oh no. What's gonna happen?"<br>
''[Bobby leans on the oranges again, and knocks them onto the ground again. Maybelle slips on them. She gets angrier at her bandmates than ever]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Ah, I see what's going on. You lured me here to prank me again."<br>
'''Papaya:''' "We didn't do that."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Scoffs and not buying it]'' "Heard that one before. Let's see how you like it."<br>
''[Maybelle throws an orange at Pi√±a and another at Papaya. Now they're mad too. The former Tropical Fruits members all start throwing oranges]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Fruit fight!"<br>
''[The boys dive behind the counter]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Ladies, please!" ''[Ducks under an orange]'' "Act your age."<br>
''[The Fruits don't appreciate Bobby's comment and glare at him. They throw more oranges at him. He screams and hides in the dairy case. The oranges form a skull and crossbones on the door. The Fruits continue their fight]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "''STOP''!" ''[The fight stops; miserably]'' "This is ''my'' fault. I tricked you all into meeting up again. I just wanted to use your song, and I thought if you talked it out Pi√±a and Papaya would finally apologize for taking Maybelle's mango."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Still mad]'' "They're never going to fess up. That's why I quit!"<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' ''[Still remorseful]'' "We wanted to apologize, but then you disappeared and we couldn't find you. I even held on to your lucky mango all these years." ''[Takes out a moldy mango in a jar]'' "Hoping to one day give it back."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Revolted]'' "You saved her old mango? Gross."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Touched. Starts tearing up]'' "My mango. Still looks good after all these years."<br>
'''Papaya:''' ''[Tears up]'' "We pranked you way too much. We never thought it would break us up."<br>
'''Pi√±a:''' ''[Also starts tearing]'' "<abbr title="Forgive us">Perd√≥nanos</abbr>"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Bring it in you two." ''[The Tropical Fruits hug]'' "Sorry I never gave you a chance to explain."<br>
'''Papaya:''' "To think we've wasted so much time over such a silly fight."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "I know. I wish we could go back to those days."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Maybe you can."
----
''[The next day at noon, Carl is scratching a record]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "This is DJ Carl with the Fruit Shake remix. Featuring The Tropical Fruits."<br>
