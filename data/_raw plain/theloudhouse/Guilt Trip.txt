''[Ronnie Anne and Bobby are eating cereal, Maria passes by on her way to work]''<br>
'''Maria:''' "Okay, I'm headed to work."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hang in there, Mom! Eight more hours and you're off for a week!"<br>
'''Maria:''' "I know. I can't wait for a week of no boils, bunions, or blisters."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Oh, Mom! I'm eating."<br>
''[Maria giggles and exits. Meanwhile, Sergio is chasing Lalo, who has Sergio's crackers]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “Give back those crackers! That's my snack.” ''[They run into the TV cabinet]'' “Nice job biscuit breath.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne picks up a book on the floor]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Hey, Mom's high school yearbook.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “Mom's in high school?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Opens the book]'' “She was, like a jillion years ago. Woah, check out Mom's hair.” ''[Maria had a giant perm that filled in the background of the photo. Her niños laugh at it. Ronnie Anne notices something else]'' “It says here she was voted... Most likely to see the world.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “But Mom's never gone overseas.”<br>
''[They look at more of her photos]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Here she is in the Italian Club.”<br>
''[A photo of her making a pizza]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' “And the East Asian Culture Club.”<br>
''[Wearing a kimono and standing under a cherry blossom tree]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “And the Young Explorers Club.” ''[A photo of her in explorers attire and standing on a rock in the mountains. Ronnie Anne gasps]'' “Bobby, when Mom was younger she wanted to travel.” ''[Closes the book on Bobby's hand. He yelps]'' “I wonder why she never did. Maybe Abuela knows.”<br>
''[They take off and another photo falls on the floor. Lalo sees and laughs at it, while Sergio gasps in shock. In high school Sergio wore thick glasses, a beanie, headgear, and a sweater vest]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Hey! That's private!”<br>
''[Grabs the photo]''
----
''[In the kitchen, Rosa is making food]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Yes, your mother wanted to see the world, but once you beautiful bebés came into her life she put her travel plans aside.” ''[Hold up platters of food]'' “Raising a family takes a lot of work you know.”<br>
''[Rosa leaves and Bobby & Ronnie Anne feel bad]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Mom never travelled because of us.” ''[Gets an idea]'' “Hey, Mom has that week of vacation coming up, maybe we can make it up to her by sending her on a trip.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “That's a great idea.” ''[Leaves and returns with his piggy bank]'' “Where can we send her for…” ''[Shakes the contents out]'' “Twelve bucks,” ''[empties his pocket]'' “a button, and a cat toy?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “No. This'll cost a lot of money, but I know a way we can win her a free trip.”<br>
''[They take off]''
----
''[Later, they are at Mr. Hong's, with Sergio, Lalo, and a giant spinning wheel]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Check out Mr. Hong's new promotion… A prize wheel. And the grand prize is a trip to Korea.” ''[Pays Mr. Hong]'' “Two packs of gum, please.”<br>
'''Mr. Hong:''' “That's good for two spins.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne spins the wheel]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Come on, Korea. Come on, Korea.” ''[The wheel lands on Korea. Ronnie Anne gasps]'' “Yes. Yes. Yes!” ''[She throws her hands around, and accidentally bumps the wheel onto the prize on the left of Korea]'' “Dang it!”<br>
'''Mr. Hong:''' ''[Wheels their prize out]'' “Congrats! You won the latest PX-5000 fridge. It makes two kinds of ice. Crushed and whole.”<br>
''[The fridge expels some ice and Ronnie Anne growls]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Bobby, you can still win.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Spits on his hands]'' “Papa's mama needs a trip to Korea.”<br>
''[Bobby spins the wheel as much as he can, and ends up getting spun too. The wheel throws him offscreen and lands on the prize on the right of Korea]''<br>
'''Mr. Hong:''' “Oh, congrats, you won a huge tuna.”
----
''[Later, they are walking down the sidewalk, with their new fridge and fish. And Ronnie Anne sees a poster in the pizzeria]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Hey, look. If we eat this super colossal pizza, we'll win a trip to Italy.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “Great idea, sis. Let's do it.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “Let's eat!”
----
''[In the restaurant, a pizza the size of the table is dropped in front of them]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Woah, they weren't kidding when they said colossal.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “Come on, we have to do it for Mom.”
''[Bobby eats his slice. Ronnie Anne stacks three slices and stuffs them all in her mouth. The pizza is getting smaller. Lalo sucks down three slices. Bobby feeds one to the freezer compartment of their new fridge, the magnets on it read YUM. Sergio waters down three slices and stuffs them in Bobby's mouth while Lalo help's Bobby chew. Ronnie Anne keeps chewing and the pizza is down to one slice, which Ronnie Anne stuffs into an already inflated Sergio. Everyone is stuffed to exhaustion and the fridge's magnets read REGRET]''<br>
'''Pizza Chief:''' "''Belíssimo'', Hey you won the prize" ''[Ronnie Anne goes up to him in anticipation] “Here's your pizza.”<br>
''[The prize is just an Italy shaped pizza]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Pizza?” ''[Takes out the poster, the bottom of which is curled up]'' “We thought we won a trip to Italy.”<br>
'''Pizza Chef:''' “That's right, a trip to Italy…” ''[Unrolls the bottom and points at the fine print]'' “For your mouth.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Seriously"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "You are a monster"<br>
'''Pizza Chief:''' "Hey Gino, these kids thought they here winning a trip to Italy ''[They both laugh]"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Let's go Bobby, don't forget the fridge"<br>
''[They start to leave, and walk up to Mr. Nakamura.”<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' "Hey kids, heard what happened. Want to win a trip to Japan?"<br>
''[The Santiago kids like the sound of that. The fridge's magnet's read GO ON…]''
----
''[Later, in the park. The fridge's magnets read UH]''<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' “You just have to beat Reizouko.”<br>
''[A giant sumo wrestler stomps his feet. Another wrestler charges at him and Reizouko belly butts him across the park]''<br>
'''Reizouko:''' ''[Roars]'' “Who's next?!”<br>
''[Sergio gulps and points down]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' “She is.”<br>
''[He's on Ronnie Anne's head]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Uh…” ''[Points at Mr. Nakamura]'' “He is.”<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' ''[Points at Bobby]'' “He is.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Points at Lalo]'' “He is.”<br>
''[Lalo barks and points at the fridge, who's magnet's read ME]''<br>
'''Reizouko:''' “A fridge? Are you mocking me!?” ''[The fridge's magnets read YES and it opens and closes it's freezer compartment at Reizouko. Everyone gasps]'' “Bring it on!”<br>
''[Reizouko stomps his feet into the ground. And fridge's magnets read UH OH and it expels more ice]''<br>
'''Bobby, Ronnie Anne, Mr. Nakamura, Sergio & Lalo:''' “Fridge! Fridge!” ''[There's a loud crashing sound and fridge lands in front of them, battered up, magnets reading OUCH]''
----
''[Back at the apartment, fridge's magnets read PAIN. Mrs. Kernicky comes down the stairs]''<br>
'''Mrs. Kernicky:''' “Hey, kids. Is everything okay?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “We tried to win Mom a trip, but lost all the contests we entered.”<br>
'''Mrs. Kernicky:''' ''[Holds up a flyer]'' “What about tonight's Great Lakes City Dance Marathon?”<br>
'''Bobby & Ronnie Anne:''' “Dance marathon?”<br>
'''Mrs. Kernicky:''' “You betcha! The last couple still dancing wins a trip around the world. Mr. Scully and I have been practicing all week. Oh, speaking of which, I better go grab him.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Looks at the flyer]'' “A trip around the world? That's perfect. We have to enter.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “We should ask Tía Frida to enter too, she can dance for hours.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Maybe we should get the whole family to dance. That'll increase our chances of winning.”<br>
''[Bobby nods]''
----
''[At the dance, everyone's warming up]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[To his hermano]'' “I can't wait to see Tía Maria's face when I win her the trip.”<br>
'''CJ:''' “You mean when I win her the trip.”<br>
''[They get in each other's faces]''<br>
'''Frida:''' “Boys, you're partners, you can't win without each other.”<br>
''[Takes their picture while Carlota breaks them up]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' “Save your energy guys, we might be here for a while.”<br>
''[The microphone turns on]''<br>
'''Mrs. Galiano:''' “Are you ready to dance?” ''[Everyone cheers]'' “Just a reminder of the rules… If you or your partner stop dancing...” ''[Blows a whistle]'' “You're out! The music will play until there's only one couple left.” ''[A giant clock is lowered]'' “Even if it takes all night. Now, who's ready to win a trip around the world?”<br>
''[Everyone cheers, including Ronnie Anne, who fist bumps Bobby. Hector's stomach rumbles]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “I'm getting a little hungry.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Came prepared, stuffs empanadas into her esposo's mouth and sushes him]'' “I came to win.”<br>
'''Mrs. Galiano:''' “On your marks… get set… Dance!”<br>
''[The music starts and everyone starts dancing. Carlos is leading Frida and going at a rather steady pace]''<br>
'''Frida:''' “Carlos, you're going so slowly.”<br>
'''Carlos:''' “I'm pacing us for success.”<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Takes her esposo closer]'' “Aye, so romantic.”<br>
''[Meanwhile, Carl and CJ are each doing their own version of the robot]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “That doesn't look like the robot.”<br>
'''CJ:''' “It's the pirate bot.”<br>
''[Meanwhile, Hector and Rosa are dancing together and Hector dips his esposa]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “You smell wonderful, mi amor.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “I smell like empanadas.”<br>
'''Hector:''' “I know.”<br>
''[Meanwhile, Lalo is shaking his behind and Carlitos is bouncing on it. Sergio is Carlota's partner]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Quit leading, that's my job.”<br>
''[They continue. Meanwhile Bobby and Ronnie Anne are working it, when Mr. Scully and Mrs. Kernicky pass them by. They are really good]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' “Wow, Mr. Scully's so nimble.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Just keep your eyes on the prize.”<br>
''[Three hours pass by and the Casagrandes are all still in. Frida looks at her familia dancing]''<br>
'''Frida:''' “Oh, I'm just so proud of our familia for coming together tonight. I need to take pictures.”<br>
''[Takes out her camera, and Mrs. Galiano blows her whistle at them]''<br>
'''Mrs. Galiano:''' “Out! No picture snapping.” ''[CJ and Carl keep dancing, but they bump into each other and start fighting]'' Out! No fighting.”<br>
''[Hector is getting hungry again]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “Uh-oh, I burned off that empanada.” ''[Sees Reizouko dancing with Fridgey]'' “Ooh, a fridge. May I cut in?”<br>
''[Opens the freezer and Mrs. Galiano pops out and blows her whistle at all four of them]''<br>
'''Mrs. Galiano:''' “Out! No partner swapping.” ''[They all groan. Meanwhile, Sergio drops a banana peel in front of Big Tony and Little Sal. They fall over and Mrs. Galiano blows her whistle at him and Carlota]'' “Out! No cheating.” ''[Meanwhile, Carlitos apparently isn't potty trained and Mrs. Galiano blows her whistle at him and Lalo]'' “Out!” ''[Blows her whistle again]'' “Out!” ''[Blows her whistle again]'' “Out!” ''[Blows her whistle at everybody]'' “You're all out!” ''[Takes a breath]'' “I feel so alive, I love this job.” ''[Bobby and Ronnie Anne are still going strong, as are Mr. Scully and Mrs. Kernicky. SIX HOURS LATER]'' “After six hours, we're down to just two couples.”<br>
''[Bobby & Ronnie Anne, and Mr. Scully & Mrs. Kernicky. The Casagrandes' cheer]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' “You got this Ronnie Anne!”<br>
'''CJ:''' “I believe in you Bobby!”<br>
''[Meanwhile, Bobby is getting really tired]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' “Must keep dancing.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Stay awake, Bobby, we're so close.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “But I'm so ti...”<br>
''[Bobby passes out and Ronnie Anne freaks out]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Picks up her snoring hermano]'' “Wake up, Bobby. Bobby!” ''[Bobby's dead asleep. Ronnie Anne sees Mrs. Galiano looking in their direction. Mrs. Galiano approaches, whistle at the ready]'' “Wake up, Bobby. Bobby!”<br>
''[She tries to wake Bobby up, but it's no good. She throws him around and tries to make it look like they're dancing together when Mrs. Galiano approaches. Mrs. Galiano takes a closer look at Bobby]''<br>
'''Mrs. Galiano:''' ''[Gasps and blows her whistle]'' “He's sleeping! Eliminated!” ''[Goes to the last couple]'' “Mrs. Kernicky and Mr. Scully win!”<br>
'''Mrs. Kernicky:''' “Sorry kids.”<br>
''[She and Mr. Scully celebrate. Suddenly Bobby wakes up]''<br>
'''Bobby:'''” Did we win?”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne groans]''

''[Back at the apartment, Fridgey's magnets read SORE. The whole family is burnt from all that dancing. Meanwhile, it's been eight hours, Maria returns home]''<br>
'''Maria:''' “What a shift. My vacation could not come at a better time.” ''[Sees the state her familia is in]'' “What happened? You look like you all just ran a marathon.”<br>
'''CJ:''' “More like danced a marathon.”<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Kind of bummed out]'' “I just miss everything, don't I?” ''[Sees her hija]'' “Ronnie Anne your feet are swollen, you should be elevating them.”<br>
''[Puts a pillow under Ronnie Anne's feet]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Mom, no, I'm fine.”<br>
'''Maria:''' “You are not fine.” ''[Looks at everyone]'' “In fact, you all look pretty beat up.”<br>
'''Carl:''' “I hurt Tía.”<br>
'''CJ:''' “I hurt more.”<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Reaches into her purse]'' “Okay, ice pack, ice pack, heat pack, bandage.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Mom, stop. We can't keep ruining things for you all the time.”<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Confused]'' “What are you talking about.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne and Bobby look at each other]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “We found your old yearbook and that you always wanted to travel. But you never got to, because of us.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “So we entered a dance marathon to win you a trip around the world. But we lost.”<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Touched]'' “That's incredibly sweet of you. But, I don't mind at all that I never got to travel. Raising you two has been the journey of a lifetime.”<br>
''[Bobby and Ronnie Anne hug their madre. Frida takes a photo and cries]''<br>
'''Frida:''' “It's so beautiful!”<br>
'''Maria:''' “Sure, I wanna eat pizza in Italy, and see sumo wrestlers in Japan. But, it'll mean so much more when I get to do it with you two.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Realizes something]'' “Wait, did you say sumo? I think there's a way you can see the world with us today. Grab your passport.”<br>
''[Takes off, leaving Bobby and Maria confused. They shrug and follow her. Carl reaches forward and drops to the floor]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “This is where I live now.”
----
''[Later, the Santiagos' are walking to Mr. Hong's]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “A walk around our block is basically a trip around the world. First stop… Korea.”<br>
''[Inside, Mr. Hong plays a kayagum for them. Photo, and a stamp for Korea. Next, they are at the pizzeria, making pizza with the chef. Bobby tosses his dough, but it lands on his face. Photo and a stamp for Italy. Finally they are sitting on a blanket in the park and having tea with Mr. Nakamura, Reizouko, and Fridgey, who's magnet's still read SORE, and is also wearing a kimono and cherry blossom. Photo and stamp for Japan]''
----
''[Later, they are back at the apartment, Maria showing the photos her the rest of the familia]''<br>
'''Maria:''' “And this was the tea ceremony.” ''[Everyone's amazed. To her niños]'' “Thank you for taking me on the best vacation ever.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Anything for you Mom.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “Yeah, we love you.” ''[They hug again. Behind them, Fridgey is spilling more ice and it's magnets read SO SWEET. They hug Fridgey, too]'' “Oh, we love you too, Fridgy.”<br>
'''Maria:''' “Come here.”
