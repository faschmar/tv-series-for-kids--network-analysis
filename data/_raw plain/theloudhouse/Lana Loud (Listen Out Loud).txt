'''Lana:''' "What up, grease monkeys! Lana Loud here with my co-mechanic, Hops." ''[Hops ribbits]'' "For today's podcast, I'm going to talk about how to treat your car like a member of the family. To demonstrate, I'm going to use Vanzilla! And all the people in the house who have the privilege of driving her. Mom, Dad, Lori and Leni. I may have had to be a little sneaky about luring them out here."<br>
'''Rita:''' "Hey kiddo, we got your note!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "It's so sweet of you to treat us to ice cream."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Can't wait to get my mint chip on!"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Me too. I'll drive."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Ah-ah-ah! Nobody's driving anywhere yet. First, I thought we'd have a little chat about the most important member of the family."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Your mother?"<br>
'''Rita:''' "Your father?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Mr. Grouse?"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Me?"<br>
'''Lana:''' "No! I'm talking about Vanzilla."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Vanzilla? That's ridiculous. It's just a car."<br>
'''Lana:''' ''[To Vanzilla]'' "Don't worry, girl. She doesn't know what she's saying." ''[To Lori]'' "Lori, who takes you to the city to see Bobby?"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Um, well, I guess, Vanzilla."<br>
'''Lana:''' "And Dad, who's the only family member who doesn't complain when you sing oldies at the top of your lungs?"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "What, those are classics! But yes, I see your point. Vanzilla."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Mom, where's the only place you can go for a soundproof scream after parent-teacher conferences?"<br>
'''Rita:''' "I didn't know you knew about that. But Vanzilla."<br>
'''Lana:''' "And Leni, who's always up for a trip to the mall?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Mr. Grouse?"<br>
'''Mr. Grouse:''' "Oh we're going to the mall? Great! I need a belt I can wear with Khakis!"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Not now, Mr. Grouse!" ''[Back to her family]'' "All I'm saying is that Vanzilla's done so much for you guys. It's time you started treating her better."<br>
'''Lori:''' "What? We treat her great."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Yes! Like a princess!"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Well, as Vanzilla's chief mechanic, I've seen otherwise. That's why I wanted to give you, and my listeners some pointers about auto care."<br>
'''Leni:''' "So we're not going out for ice cream?"<br>
'''Lana:''' "We'll see if you earn it. Now let's start with the windshield. As you can see, Vanzilla is covered in…"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Ew! What's all that gunk?!"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Bug splats." ''[Hops ribbits]'' "You don't see them get this thick unless you've got a real speed demon behind the wheel."<br>
''[Lana clears her throat and everyone looks at someone]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "What? Why's everyone looking at me?!"<br>
''[Everyone tells Lori off]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Come on, Lori Lu."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Listeners, if you've got a lead foot like Lori in the family, here's a quick way to get your windshield nice and clean. Everyone, grab an ice-scraper. I've found it's the best tool for cleaning off those grimy bug guts." ''[Everyone gets scraping]'' "That's right, Lori, put your back into it."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Ew, this is literally gross."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Ah! Guys, this bug is still alive!"<br>
''[Hops ribbits and eats the bug]''<br>
'''Lana:''' "Oops. Not anymore. Thanks for the help, Hops, but splitsies next time, all right? Okay. The windshield's looking good. Up next, let's take a peek at the belly of the beast. A.k.a. the undercarriage."<br>
''[Everyone sinks under]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Oh my back!"<br>
'''Rita:''' "Do we have to get this low?"<br>
'''Lana:''' "All right. Everybody roll under with me. There you go."<br>
''[They roll under]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[Whistles]'' "Look at all the mud caked on here."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Exactly, Dad. Now normally, I can't get enough of this stuff. But it doesn't belong on Vanzilla. Isn't that right, Mom?"<br>
'''Rita:''' "Why are you asking me?!"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Been doing some off-roading in Hazeltuckey again?"<br>
'''Rita:''' "Of course not! Maybe! I just drove through a puddle."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Then how do you explain all the corn husks stuck in here?"<br>
'''Rita:''' "Okay. Fine. You caught me. But Lily had just had a diaper blow-out, and I had to get back home."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Listeners, if you too have a mom who takes shortcuts through cornfields, you can clean off the undercarriage with a few blasts from a power washer."<br>
''[Blasts the washer]''<br>
'''Rita:''' "You might want to use that on the car seat too. The diaper can only hold so much."<br>
'''Lana:''' "I'm on it!"<br>
''[Blasts the washer again]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Watch my dry cleaning!"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Oh sorry, Pops." ''[To the listeners]'' "Next up, I'd like to direct your attention To Vanzilla's doors and trim. As you can see, they're pretty scratched up."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Okay, okay, you caught me! Gosh, you're good."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Actually, I had no idea who scratched them. But now I do."<br>
'''Leni:''' "I'm sorry, but why are those compact parking spots always so tight?"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Cause they're for compact cars."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Oh. I thought they were for people with makeup compacts."<br>
'''Lana:''' "It's okay, Leni. Words can sometimes mean two things. But don't worry. These scratches are easy to get out. Just take a little squirt of toothpaste. And buff them right out. Come on, everybody try it."<br>
'''Rita:''' "Wow, I can't believe this toothpaste actually works."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Oh-Em-Gosh. I know right? Let's see what it does for my under-eye circles." ''[Squirts toothpaste in her eyes and starts screaming]'' "My eye!"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Don't worry! I've got you, Leni."<br>
''[Blasts the power washer at Leni. Leni screams again]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Oh, that's better."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Quick thinking, Lori. But now Leni made a dent in the van. Hops, you wanna take care of that? ''[Hops ribbits and pulls the dent out with his tongue]'' Listeners, if you don't have a frog friend with a super suction tongue, you can also get a dent out with a plunger. Now, just got to get the frog spit off the car. And we're good."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Wow! Vanzilla hasn't looked this fine since Nineteen-seventy-nine." ''[A chime sound is heard. Lynn Sr. gasps]'' "It even sounds clean!"<br>
'''Mr. Grouse:''' "Nope! That's me practicing my triangle. Your van's still a heap of junk."<br>
'''Lana:''' "We're working on it, Mr. Grouse!"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Well Lana, now that you've dealt with all the problem drivers in the family, what say we go get that ice cream?"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Nice try, Mr. I can't change a tire."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "What? That's... That's not true!"<br>
'''Lana:''' "C'mon, Dad. The last time you got a flat I had to ride my bike across town to change it for you."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Well, I uh…"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Do you know how hard it is to pedal while carrying a spare tire?"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Good point. I guess it's time I learned how to do it myself."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Okay, listeners, here's how you change a tire. First step, jack up the car." ''[Does so]'' "Then, take your tire iron and loosen the lug nuts. Dad, care to take a swing at it?"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Gladly."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Now remember. Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey!"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[Chuckles]'' "Thanks, sweetie, but I think I know how this works." ''[Strainfully tries, then nervously chuckles]'' "It's just a… Why… won't… this… budge?!"<br>
''[Drops the iron]''<br>
'''Rita:''' "Honey, let me give it a shot."<br>
''[Takes the lugnut off with ease]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[A little embarrassed]'' "Oh, thanks, hun."<br>
'''Rita:''' "Well, you loosened it for me, sweetie."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Once the lug nuts are off, just remove the old tire… and grab a new one. Make sure it's inflated to the proper air pressure. Hey, where's my high-power air compressor?"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Using it to blowdry her hair]'' "This blow dryer thingy's amazing! It's giving me so much volume!"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Give it!" ''[Takes it off]'' "Okay, once your air pressure is good, slap that new tire on, tighten the lug nuts, and you're good to go. See? Easy!" ''[Hops ribbits]'' "What's that, Hops? Our time is almost up? Well that's okay, because I think our listeners and the drivers in my family have learned a lot today."<br>
''[Everyone agrees]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "So, can we get ice cream now?"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Of course, you've earned it! In fact, double scoops for everyone! It's on me. You wouldn't believe how much change I found under Vanzilla's seats."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Everyone in. Let's hit that rocky road! Ha-ha. Get it?" ''[Hops ribbits]'' "Well, Hops feels me."<br>
'''Lori:''' "I have to admit, I'm impressed, Lana. You really know your stuff."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Yeah, you're such a pro."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Well, when you've been Vanzilla's mechanic as long as I have, you learn a thing or two about how to treat the old girl right."<br>
''[The van starts up, there's beeping and the engine shuts off]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "What's wrong now?"<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[smells something]'' "Ew, and what is that smell?"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Huh?"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Oh, oh that is rank!"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Come on, Hops. Let's take a look." ''[Gets out and looks]'' "Uh oh."<br>
''[Hops ribbits]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Is - is it something we did?"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Actually, I think this one might be my bad."<br>
'''Rita:''' "What's that stuck to the engine?"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Is that an old egg salad sandwich?"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Bug salad actually. With extra crickets for crunch. Mm. I must have dropped it during my last maintenance tune-up. I'll take care of that."<br>
''[Eats it and burps]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Ew! Get it away from me!"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Oh, she ate it! Oh!"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Heh, even better toasted." ''[Hops ribbits]'' "Oh, sorry, Hops, I should've gone splitsies." ''[Hops ribbits]'' "No, you're right. I should also apologize. Mom, Dad, Lori, Leni, I'm sorry for being such a hypocrite. Clearly, I'm also guilty of not always treating Vanzilla like family."<br>
'''Rita:''' "Well, you certainly made her smell like family."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Don't worry about it, sweetie. You taught us so much today."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Bring it in, Lans."<br>
''[Family hug]''<br>
'''Louds:''' "Aw!"<br>
'''Mr. Grouse:''' ''[Honks his horn]'' "All right. Break it up, Louds. I'm late to triangle practice and your heap of junk is blocking the road."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Sorry, Mr. Grouse! Listeners, that's all the time we have for today. This has been Lana Loud reminding you to treat your car right. All right guys. Next stop, ice cream." ''[Hops ribbits]'' "Yes, Hops, you can get sprinkles."<br>
