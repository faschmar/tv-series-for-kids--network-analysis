''[Inside Par's Dojo, Carl kicks the door open while in mid-air and rolls his way into the classroom, performing a karate stunt in front of his friends Alexis and Tom. They clap.]''<br>
'''Alexis:''' "Wow, Carl. We've only been in class two weeks, and you're already our star student."<br>
''[Carl continues performing karate moves. He then shows his biceps.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Mwah!"<br>''[They clap again.]''<br>'''Tom:''' "Yeah. Sweet moves."<br>'''Alexis:''' "I've been taking karate here for months." ''[Sighs]'' "And I still can't even tie my belt right." ''[Ties his belt into a bow tie, and falls to the ground. Tom soon helps Alexis back on his feet.]''<br>'''Carl:''' "My mom ties my belt. But ''I'' got the mad karate skills. If you ask nice, I don't mind helping you guys out." ''[Carl is grunting and doing karate moves.]''<br>
''[Par arrives.]''<br>'''Par:''' "Alright, my awesome trio, ''big'' news! We're now a class of ''four''!"<br>
''[He reveals the fourth student, who is Adelaide.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Adelaide?! I mean, Adelaide."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Carl."<br>
'''Par:''' "This is great! Since you guys already know each other, why don't you show her the ropes, Carl?"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Sure, sensei. I'd love to show her! Show her who's number one..." ''[Evil laugh]''
----
''[Unfortunately, Adelaide has just defeated him easily.]''<br>
'''Alexis:''' "Wow, Adelaide! How'd you do that?"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "I just did what Sensei Par said to do."<br>
''[She bows, and Par bows back, tears in his eyes.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Beginner's luck! I was going easy on you 'cause it's your first time. It is your first time, right?"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Yup! But it seems pretty simple."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Or so you think! Time to get serious!" ''[He runs at Adelaide, but she grabs him by his underwear and slams him.]'' "Beginner's luck..."
----
''[Par and the four students are spaced out on the floor grunting and performing karate moves. Adelaide somersaults, splits her legs in mid-air and stands with her foot up to head height. Carl tries to copy her but yelps as he lands in the split position. He moans and drops his head.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Beginner's luck..."
----
''[Carl then tries to break a plank of wood with his wrist, but his whole body shakes as he makes contact and the plank doesn't break. He faints again. We then see Adelaide continuously breaking planks from different scenarios. Shards of wood fly across the screen while Carl is still down.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Beginner's luck..."
----
''[Outside the building, we see everyone standing together except Carl, whom is further away enviously looking at Adelaide. She helps tie Alexis' belt perfectly.]''<br>
'''Alexis:''' "She tied my belt."<br>
'''Tom:''' "Wow."<br>
'''Par:''' "Amazing." ''[Offers his camera to Carl.]'' "Hey, Carl. Take a picture of me and my new star student."<br>
''[Carl groans in anger while he holds the camera.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Say cheese!"<br>
''[The camera shutter clicks. He looks at the photo, which shows Par and Adelaide grinning while Par's arm is wrapped around her shoulder. Carl has an expression close to breaking point as Par takes the camera from him.]''<br>
'''Par:''' "Thanks. I'll treasure this forever."<br>
''[Carl is motionless while Adelaide walks up to him.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "I guess it's ''not'' "Beginner's Luck"."<br>
''[She shrugs shoulders and leaves. Carl stares at her while she walks away and growls in anger. He then folds his arms.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Yep. She's gotta go." ''[Evilly]'' "And I know just how to do it." <br>
''[He laughs evilly, but only for a brief moment as Frida enters behind his back.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "I'm here to take you home, mi amor."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "Mom, you ruined my scheming moment."<br>
'''Frida:''' "I'm sorry, mijo." ''[Pats his head]'' "Just pretend I'm not even here. I'll cover my ears."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Thank you." ''[Clears his throat. He laughs evilly.]''
----
''[Tense music plays as his evil laughter distracts people out in the streets. He then evil laughs along with Sergio.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "And now the glue."<br>
''[More laughter is heard. A pillow is pulled off, making both of them yelp in panic. The camera zooms out. Ronnie Anne, Breakfast Bot and Sid appears while Carl and Sergio are inside a "hideout" consisting of a group of pillows. Ronnie Anne puts a pillow on the couch.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Uh, what are you two doing?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "And why is Carl laughing like that?"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "We're rigging a b--" <br>
''[--Carl clips his beak.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Remember whose dessert you're getting for a whole week, bird."<br>
''[The two hide inside their "hideout".]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I don't wanna know. Let's go, Sid."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Right. We gotta work on the new and improved Breakfast Bot. I added a fruit prep function. Let's see how he does with apples."<br>
''[She tosses an apple onto Breakfast Bot. He catches it, and while holding it in place, crushes it with his hammer arms, covering the girls with apple juice.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Hmm. Needs work."<br>
''[The trio walk away. Inside the "hideout", Carl pours a cracker mix box upside-down and creates a random object.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Go to work, Sergio."<br>
''[The parrot bites away at it. The object now looks like a plank of wood. Carl busts the pillows away and shows off his new plank.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Perfecto! Easy-to-break cracker boards complete." ''[He snaps the plank, and laughs. Sergio brings in a rubber board to show Carl.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Rubber boards done too."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Sweet. Let's try it out." ''[He starts preparing a punch and punches the board. However, the fist bounces off the rubber board and hits his face, sending him flying back and crashing into something off-screen, causing Sergio to squeeze his eyes shut. Carl groans.]'' "Perfect."
----
''[There's a knock on the door. Carl and Sergio and standing behind the door - Carl holding a scroll, and Sergio holding the radio.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Quick! Cue the challenge music." ''[Random music plays with frog croaking sound effects, to Carl's dismay.]'' "Not that song!" ''[He tries to grab the radio off Sergio.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Don't touch my boom-box!"<br>
''[The door opens. Adelaide comes in, watching the two.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hurry up!" ''[She clears her throat sarcastically, startling Carl.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "What do you want, Carl? "Sugar, Sugar Rainbow Unicorn Friendship Hour" is on. I'm missing the intro."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Adelaide Chang, I hereby challenge you to a board breaking duel tomorrow. Hiya!" ''[He opens the scroll, revealing a drawing of himself karate kicking her, with "CHALLENGE!" written on top.]'' "Loser leaves karate class... ''forever''!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "No thanks." ''[She steps back and closes the door. However Carl props his head through it and shows her the poster.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "What? OK, I get it. You're too scared."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "Ugh, fine. I'll duel with you. But don't cry to me when you have to leave the class after I win." ''[Giddily hops away, singing]'' "Sugar, Sugar Rainbow Unicorn Friendship Hour..."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "Oh. You're going down." ''[Slams the door shut.]''
----
''[All five members are inside Par's Dojo. With Par standing in the middle between two stacks of wooden boards, the students are grouped in teams of two. Adelaide and Tom, and Alexis and Carl - the latter also being accompanied by Sergio, who pops out and gives Carl a thumb up. Carl walks over to the other team and offers a handshake to a grumpy looking Adelaide.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Good luck."<br>
''[Sergio sneaks out from behind Carl and replaces the wooden boards with rubber boards. While Alexis ties his belt, Carl moves back to his side. Sergio swaps the wooden boards with cracker boards.]''<br>
'''Par:''' "Okay. I didn't know we were having a contest tonight, but I'm glad you guys are so motivated. And start!"<br>
''[He signals. Alexis displays a cracker board to Carl. He chops through it easily. We then see multiple successful chops.]''<br>
'''Alexis:''' "Wow. You're snapping these like twigs."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Pops out]'' "Or crackers." ''[Carl forces him back inside.]'' Ow!<br>
''[Adelaide tries to chop a rubber board from Tom, but it bounces her hand back.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Shocked]'' "What the heck?!" <br>
''[She grunts and tries multiple chops to break the one rubber board. On the other side, Carl chops away each cracker board from a spinning Alexis. Par stops the stop-clock]''<br>
'''Par:''' "''And'' time." ''[He gestures and smiles to Carl, the winner.]'' "Carl broke... fourteen? Wow! Amazing! And Adelaide, ''[Shocked]'' zero?"<br>
''[Carl laughs and Karate Chops Tom out of the screen. He confronts and taunts at Adelaide]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Yeah! Whoa! I so kicked your butt."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Congratulations, Carl. I guess I'm quitting class now."<br>
'''Par:''' "Wait. You're leaving?"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Yep. I promised."<br>''[She passes a note to Par and leaves. Carl waves with an excited look on his face.]''<br>
'''Par:''' "That's a bummer. And it changes my plans a lot. Carl, I was gonna ask Adelaide, but now ''you're'' my last hope. Can you do a board breaking demonstration at your school tomorrow?"<br>
''[Carl gasps.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Can I? You got it. I'm the star student after all."<br>
'''Par:''' "Ah, great. You're a lifesaver." ''[He walks away. Sergio pops up from Carl's kit.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "We're gonna need more fake boards."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks and shows another cracker box.]'' "Coming right up." ''[They both laugh maniacally.]''
----
''[The school bell rings. Carl carries a group of cracker boards across the corridor, where he meets Par rolling a trolley of wooden boards. Carl shows him his boards.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Ready to go, Par. Just tell me where I should put the boards."<br>
'''Par:''' "No need, brah. We're using these special promo boards I had made. Check it." ''[Shows him his board with a logo of Par's face in the middle. He chops it. The board starts speaking.]''<br>'''Par Board:''' "Oh, yeah! Join Par's Dojo."<br>
'''Par:''' "Pretty sweet, huh?"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Unconfident]'' "Yeah. Sweet."<br>
'''Par:''' "I'm glad you think so." ''[Whispering]'' Uh, between you and me, we really need to impress the kids and get them to join the class or the dojo is going out of business.<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Sweats and panics]'' "Out of business? Forever?"<br>
'''Par:''' "Well, yeah. Our class is super small. And losing Adelaide was really tough. That was a quarter of our money right there." ''[Carl facepalms]'' "Anyway, go ahead and warm up. I'm gonna go get the banner I made." ''[Gives a par board to Carl and leaves with the trolley.]'' "It also has my face on it."<br>
''[Carl breathes heavily and sweats. Sergio pops out again.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "What do we do now, Sergio? The dojo won't close if we don't do the demonstration." ''[Shows a miserable look]'' "And karate class is my favorite." ''[Holds the Par Board]'' "Maybe I'm strong enough now." ''[He chops the board. It doesn't break. Instead, it causes his hand to become swollen. He bursts into tears.]'' "Ow!" ''[He shows his swollen hand to Sergio.]'' "Kiss it better. Kiss it better."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Flaps out of Carl's uniform.]'' "Ew. Kiss it yourself."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Groans]'' "Mwah. We need a plan."<br>
'''Sergio:''' "You're on your own, buddy. I've already got your dessert for the next week. My advice?" ''[Points at him]'' "Find another way to cheat." <br>
''[He grabs Carl's cracker boards and swoops off. Carl walks around the corridor and starts thinking.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Another way to cheat?" ''[Has an idea]'' "Oh! I got it! If I can't use fake boards anymore, then I just need something that can break the real ones. Hmm... But what's strong enough?"<br>
''[Mechanical rumbling can be heard in the distance. Carl peeps through the window of a door. On the other side is Sid testing Breakfast Bot. With him facing an apple, Sid activates it with the press of a button. It chops the apple into slices.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Ooh." ''[The bot places a herb on top as garnish. The finished product shines to her excitement.]'' "All right, Breakfast Bot! You finally got apples. Let's try a harder fruit now. Maybe coconut? Pineapple? I'll check the cafeteria. Be right back." ''[She opens the door and runs along the corridor, passing Carl - whom is whistling nervously.]'' "Oh. Hey, Carl."<br>
''[As soon as Sid passes by, Carl turns his eyes to the door and has an evil smile on his face.]''
----
''[In the hall, the stage is set. Par is stood in the center in front of a crowd accompanied by his promo boards. Carl is standing off stage.]''<br>
'''Par:''' "And now, to show you how awesome karate is and how good I am at teaching it, meet our class's star student, Carl Casagrande!"<br>
''[Carl Karate kicks his way onto the stage.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hiya!"<br>
'''Student #1:''' "Ooh."<br>
'''Student #2:''' "Wow."<br>
''[Par displays one of his boards to Carl. Carl chops it perfectly. The camera closes in, revealing Carl's robotic hand.]''<br>
'''Par Board:''' "Oh, yeah! Join Par's Dojo."<br>
''[Carl chops another board.]''<br>
'''Par Board:''' "Oh, yeah!"<br>
''[Carl chops yet another board.]''<br>
'''Par Board:''' "Oh, yeah!"<br>
''[The crowd gasp. Carl continuously chops Par Boards with his robotic hand from a spinning Par.]''<br>
'''Par Boards:''' ''[Overlapping]'' "Oh, yeah!"
----
''[Back at the testing lab, Sid hums a tune and brings a pineapple onto the desk in front of Breakfast Bot - whose arms have been changed with tools strapped on to pieces of masking tape. Sid presses the activation button on her remote, but notices the robot still stationary.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Huh? Weird. Why isn't it working?"<br>
''[Cut back to stage, while Carl yawns. At the same time, the robotic hand that is attached to Carl stops. Carl suddenly notices.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "What?"<br>
''[He struggles as he tries to take off his robotic hand. Back to the lab, an annoyed Sid presses the activation button several times in quick succession, with Carl's robotic arm shaking about frantically. Sid then moves the analog stick on her remote control. Carl's robotic arm moves away from Par's board, causing Carl to balance on his toes.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Let's try it on a higher setting."<br>
''[She turns the knob to maximum. Electronic beeping sounds. Cut back to the stage. Par is forced to step back and shield himself with one of his boards as Carl is forced up in the air growing several arms from behind his karate suit, looking like a giant spider. He yelps as the arms move about drastically and destroy Par's board. He uncontrollably leaves the stage, only to storm back and rip the curtains towards the other side. He then appears back on stage with a student caught on three of its arms. The arms toss the student in the air, causing him to crash land on something off-screen, while Par has his hands on his cheeks. Afterwards, Carl lands on his head while the robotic arms continue to move about.]''<br>
'''Par:''' "Carl, is everything okay?"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Sweating and struggling to break free.]'' "Does it look okay?" ''[He screams and falls off the stage in front of the crowd. He lands on his face free of the robotic arms. He groans while he's down. A girl in front of the crowd points at Carl]''<br>
'''Girl:''' ''[Gasps in horror]'' "His arm fell off!"<br>
''[She faints backwards, creating a domino effect in the front row. Suddenly, a boy cuts in and points at the robotic arms.]''<br>
'''Boy:''' "Hey! Those aren't real arms!"<br>
''[Sid finds the robotic arms.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you guys."<br>
''[She collects all the arms and leaves. Par gasps as the crowd jeers and boos at him.]''<br>
'''Woman:''' "Par's Dojo stinks!"<br>
''[Par tries to hold his tears, but then he sighs defeatedly.]''<br>
'''Par:''' "Goodbye, dojo."<br>
''[Carl gets up and gasps in horror. The camera cuts to the back of the stage while the crowd are still jeering.]''<br>
'''Boy:''' "This was lame."<br>
''[Carl tries to get everyone's attention.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Everyone, wait." ''[He climbs back on the stage, breathing heavily.]'' "Okay. I cheated. Yes." ''[Par gasps]'' "But Par is a great sensei, and our dojo is cool. I can prove it." ''[Adelaide and Tom are in the crowd]'' "Adelaide is... ''[Groans]'' a karate genius who Par trained." ''[The crowd gasp except for Adelaide. Carl gestures.]'' "I'm sorry. I cheated before too so I could get you to leave class. I just liked being the best one there."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Sarcastically]'' "What are you saying, Carl?"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "Ugh, you're really milking this, aren't you? I'm saying you're better than me. ''[Bows]'' So please do the demo and save the dojo."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Sarcastically]'' "All I needed to hear was that I'm better. Let's do this."<br>
''[Adelaide jumps on Carl's back, somersaults and lands on stage in her fighting pose.]''<br>
'''Par:''' "All right! Roll that music!"<br>
''[Rock music plays. Adelaide and Par nod in agreement. He tosses one of his boards in the air. Adelaide rises up and kicks the board in half. The crowd gasp.]''<br>
'''Par Boards:''' "Oh yeah!"<br>
''[She delivers multiple successful chops to each Par Board.]''<br>
'''Par Boards:''' "Oh yeah! Join Par's Dojo." <br>
''[Adelaide lands back on stage. A banner reading "PAR's DOJO" opens and confetti falls. The crowd cheers.]''<br>
'''Students:''' "Wow!" "She's so cool." "I believe again!" "Sign me up!"<br>
''[Par and Adelaide take a bow.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "I will train harder. And one day, I'll be the best." ''[Evil laugh.]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' ''[Cutting in, now in a karate suit with a black belt and his normal arms attached.]'' "You'll have to defeat me first." ''[He laughs ominously, growing several arms from behind his karate suit, looking like a giant spider.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Huh?" ''[He screams and runs away.]''
