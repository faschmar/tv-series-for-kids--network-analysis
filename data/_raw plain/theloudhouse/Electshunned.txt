''[The episode starts with Leni at City Hall sorting out Mayor Davis's files]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Okay, 'A file about zoning laws'. Another one that goes under 'A'!" ''[She fits the file under "A", but there's a lot of files under that and struggles to push it in.]'' "Phew."<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' "Great work, Leni! How are you liking the internship so far?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "OMGosh, Mayor Davis, it's the best! I learned how to fix a copier."<br>
''[Flashback to earlier in the internship]''<br>
'''Assistant:''' "Dang it, the copier needs toner!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Ooh, I just got a great new toner." ''[applies makeup to the copier]'' "And I got a lipstick you'll love." ''[adds lipstick]''<br>
''[Back to the present.]''<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' "Leni, you are a hoot. When my campaign manager arrives, send him in. It's time to talk re-election! We've got a race to win!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "If you're going to run a race, my sister Lynn says you should always do some warmups." ''[does jumping jacks]''<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' ''[laughs]'' "Leni, I don't think-"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Come on, Mayor! Get that blood pumping!" ''[Mayor Davis shrugs and joins her in doing jumping jacks]'' "Three, four, five..."
----
''[Later, at Mayor Davis's office.]''<br>
'''Vic:''' "Alright, first things first. If anyone runs against you, we dig up some grade-A dirt on them. It worked like a charm the last election." ''[It's revealed Davis's previous opponent was Flip.]'' "Then, we stage a ton of photo ops with you playing your keyboard. Voters say sound effects are quote-'fun and relatable'. Also, kissing babies is so last election. People are really into their pets now." ''[Picks up his pet lizard.]'' "I figured you could get in some smooch practice on my stepdaughter's Gila monster."<br>
''[Mayor Davis sighs as he approaches her with the lizard, but Leni knocks on the door.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Mayor Davis, sorry to interrupt." ''[The Gila monster hisses and escapes, forcing Vic to chase it.]'' "I'd love to help your campaign. I've got lots of great ideas, like adding flavors to the drinking fountains. People would hydrate if they could choose kiwi or pomelo water. Or a new vest for crossing guards. I'm working on a concept." ''[shows an image on her phone of Rita in the concept]''<br>
'''Vic:''' ''[bruised while carrying the Gila monster]'' "Huh. Those ideas are ''terrible''."<br>
''[Leni gasps]''<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' "Now, now, Vic. Leni, I like your enthusiasm, but running for mayor takes more than quirky ideas."<br>
''[Leni whines and leaves.]''<br>
'''Vic:''' "Pucker up, Mayor Davis."<br>
''[Holds the Gila monster, already puckered up. Mayor Davis groans]''
----
''[Night at the Loud House. Most of the Louds are eagerly eating spaghetti for dinner, but Leni isn't interested and stares dejectedly.]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Not bad, if I do say so myself!"<br>
'''Luan:''' "Good, Dad!"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Snaps]'' "My ideas are not terrible!"<br>
''[The rest of the Louds pause their eating.]''<br>
'''Rita:''' "Sweetie, what are you talking about?"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "I pitched ideas for the mayor's re-election campaign, and her meanie campaign manager hated them. I have good ideas, you know, like new comfy cushions for all those old lumpy school bus seats!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Now that you mention it, my butt ''has'' been numb since kindergarten."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[stepping on the table]'' "Or keeping stores open past nine! Has anyone heard of night people?!"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Preach."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[stands on the table]'' "Or longer green lights so you can get to the movies in time for the previews!"<br>
'''Rita:''' ''[Excitedly]'' "Wow, sweetie, those are great ideas!"<br>
'''Lana:''' "If you were running for mayor, I'd vote for ya. If I could vote."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Me, too!"<br>
'''Lola:''' "Me, three!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Ooh, love that idea!"
----
''[At the Royal Woods Mall, Lana, Hops, Lincoln, Lynn, and Lisa are building a stage for Leni's campaign while Luan prepares whoopee cushions for marketing purposes. Lola is overseeing the progress.]''<br>
'''Lola:''' "Lower, Lincoln." ''[Lincoln is adjusting the sign and lowers it]'' "No, higher!" ''[Lincoln moves it higher]'' "Lower!" ''[Lincoln moves it so low he falls]'' "Okay, now it's ''too'' low." ''[approaches Luan and picks up and reads a whoopee cushion]'' "'''Leni Loud isn't full of hot air!''' Seriously? As campaign manager, I absolutely did not approve whoopee cushions."<br>
'''Luan:''' "Leni never said ''you'' were her campaign manager."<br>
'''Lola:''' "She didn't ''say'' it, Luan, but I'm the obvious choice! Leni and I have the same sophisticated vision."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[approaches]'' "Ooh, farts!" ''[presses a whoopee cushion]'' "So fun." ''[Luan giggles, Lola growls]'' "Okay, guys, I'll catch you after the rally. Wish me luck!" ''[She leaves. The other two girls wave goodbye.]''
----
''[Mayor Davis and Vic are at the mall; Vic takes all the free yogurt samples from the tray.]''<br>
'''Vic:''' "Why pay when samples are free? That's old Vic's motto."<br>
''[Meanwhile Leni is making a speech on the stage.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "I'm Leni Loud, and I would like to be your new mayor!"<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' ''[flabbergasted]'' "''Leni's'' running for mayor?!"<br>
'''Vic:''' ''[scoffs]'' "Well, here's to an easy victory for you."<br>
'''Leni:''' "If you vote for me, I'll have a no-tax shopping day here at the mall! You have a right to buy a poncho and have money left for a calzone!"<br>
''[The crowd cheers]''<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' ''[drops her yogurt in shock]'' "Wait. Are people actually listening to her?!"<br>
'''Vic:''' ''[the Gila monster steals the yogurt off his hand and eats it]'' "Relax. The Vicster's got this." ''[notices his yogurt is gone]'' "Huh?"
----
''[Vanzilla, bearing Leni on the top, drives to Tall Timbers Park]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[speaking into a megaphone]'' "Voters, have you noticed there's no cell service at Tall Timbers Park? When I snap a cute nature selfie," ''[takes a selfie]'' "I wanna post it now! Mother Nature deserves five bars!"<br>
''[The crowd clap and cheer.]''<br>
'''Residents:''' "Genius!" "What a relief!"<br>
'''Vic:''' ''[pulls over in his own truck with a caricature of a baby Leni]'' "Is this what you want? An inexperienced baby for mayor? Vote for Davis, a grown adult!" ''[drives off]''<br>
'''Rita:''' ''[Fiercely]'' "Oh, no, he did not!" ''[To Leni]'' "Hold on, sweetie!"<br>
''[She starts Vanzilla and drives off. Vic is laughing, but notices Vanzilla behind him.]''<br>
'''Vic:''' "Wha-?"<br>
''[The van drives side-by-side with the truck. They talk through the side windows.]''<br>
'''Rita:''' "Oh, you wanna play? Let's play!"<br>
'''Lola:''' ''[Threateningly]'' "You messed with the wrong FAMILY, BUDDY!"<br>
''[Rita speeds off, but crashes into a pond, messing up Lola and Leni's makeup. Vic and the Gila monster give an aside glance]''<br>
'''Rita:''' "Oops."<br>
''[Vic stops and laughs in victory before driving off.]''<br>
'''Lola:''' ''[gets out of Vanzilla]'' "Leni, as your campaign manager, I am telling you, WE HAVE TO HIT BACK!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Lola, that's not my campaign. Mayor Davis may play icky, but I don't." ''[Lola groans]'' "Let's go. We've got a big debate tomorrow." ''[Picks off some of her makeup.]'' "I've got to deal with this mascara situation, and my stance on economic stimulus."<br>
----
''[At Royal Woods High School, Leni and Mayor Davis are in a debate]''<br>
'''Leni:''' “…and as mayor, I'd make opening more nail salons my number one priority.”<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' "Hah. I'd wish there was a mani''cure'' for all my opponent's wacky ideas."<br>
''[The crowd laughs with Mayor Davis. Luna, Lisa, Lola, and Lucy are watching from backstage.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "She's dying up there. In a bad way."<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' ''[looks at Vic; he nods]'' "Voters, family values matter to all of us, so the kind of family a mayor comes from is important. Frankly, the Louds are out of control." ''[Leni gasps]'' "[[Linc or Swim|They were banned from every pool in town]], [[Last Loud on Earth|they created a zombie scare]], and [[Write and Wrong|have you ever eaten in a restaurant with them? Trust me, it's not pretty]]." ''[Lola is so incensed she tries to march up to the podium, but Luna, Lisa, and Lucy catch her. Leni also has a mean look.]'' "Are those the family values we want? I certainly don't. Vote Davis!" ''[whips out a keyboard and jams out to her supportive crowd, while Leni storms off stage.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Angrily]'' "Nobody talks about my family like that. We are so hitting back."
----
''[That night, Leni sneaks into City Hall with Lynn and the twins.]''<br>
'''Lola:''' "OK, team. We need something super juicy on Mayor Davis. Now let's get digging."<br>
'''Lana:''' ''[she and Hops have shovels]'' "On it. Wait, where's the dirt?"<br>
'''Lynn:''' "It's just an expression, Lans."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Aw, man."<br>
''[She and Hops throw their shovels to the carpet while Lola and Lynn proceed.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Shh. You have to be quiet or we're gonna get-" ''[Lynn plays some keyboard music, Leni hides in a potted plant and Lola eats the documents she was perusing]'' "Lynn, turn that off!"<br>
''[Leni unplugs the keyboard, but notices something juicy on it and smirks. Lola takes a snapshot and snickers maliciously.]''
----
''[The next day, Leni gives a speech in front of City Hall]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "It's time Royal Woods knew the truth. Mayor Davis bought her keyboard at Toots 'n' Tunes, which is in... Hazeltucky!" ''[A few reporters gasp and faint]'' "Do you want a mayor who doesn't bother to shop in her own town? Ick, I certainly don't! I'm Leni Loud, and I shop local a lot!"<br>
''[Mayor Davis is watching Leni's speech in her office, and trembles]''<br>
'''Vic:''' "Don't worry, Mayor Davis. Old Vicko's gonna take care of this."
----
''[Leni is making a speech at Sunset Canyon Retirement Home]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Society must modernize, and that's why I support a new touchscreen pudding machine."<br>
''[The elders cheer]''<br>
'''Scoots:''' "Yadda-yadda. Enough of the sweet talk. When're you gonna fling some more mud at Davis? Mama needs drama!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Sorry, no more playing dirty from Leni Loud's campaign. Swearsies!"<br>
''[Scoots blows a raspberry, and the elders leave. Suddenly, Lola comes rushing in a panic showing a flyer to Leni.]''<br>
'''Lola:''' "Leni, look what Mayor Davis is mailing out to people!" ''[hands a flyer detailing Leni wearing denim on denim with the phrase "DENIM ON DENIM WHO DOES THAT?? NOT MAYOR DAVIS!"; Leni is horrified]'' "Huh. That is a tragic amount of denim."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Determined]'' "Okay, now it's personal!"
----
''[At the Loud House, Lincoln shows Leni an ad he had made.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[narrating]'' "Everybody loves cat videos, right?"<br>
''[The ad plays heavily doctored footage of Mayor Davis]''<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' "I certainly don't. I'd wish they were banned and never came back."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[narrating]'' "Do you want a cat hater in the mayor's office? Well, I certainly don't! Vote Leni Loud. This ad was paid for by the First Bank of Lola."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Wow, Lincoln. That ad was really harsh and totally untrue." ''[fist bumps her brother]'' "''Love'' it!"<br>
''[Another ad pops up. The two siblings perk up in surprise.]''<br>
'''Vic:''' ''[narrating]'' "[[Driving Miss Hazy|Leni Loud failed her driving test fourteen times. How do you know she won't drive over your rights or family]]?"<br>
''[Leni gasps and then growls in retaliation. Cue a montage of Mayor Davis and Leni throwing shade at each other.]''<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' "Leni Loud supports mandated makeovers!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Did you know that Mayor Davis wears open-toed shoes in the winter?"<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' "She's not a natural blonde."<br>
'''Leni:''' "She hates Flippees. OMGosh!"<br>
''[The two candidates growl at each other.]''
----
''[The next day at Royal Woods High School. There's a banner labeled '''OMGOSH! LENI LOUD RALLY TODAY!!!'''. Indoors, Leni's supporters are waiting for her final speech, some of whom are carrying "OMGosh!" banners.]''<br>
'''Crowd:''' ''[chanting]'' "OMGosh! OMGosh!"<br>
''[Backstage, Leni is getting ready with a fierce look as Lola is massaging her shoulders and Lana has a drink ready. Lisa is reading the analysis.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Leni, you're in a deadlock with Mayor Davis. Statistically speaking, you could win this race."<br>
'''Lola:''' ''[Threateningly]'' "Now listen up, this is your last speech before the election. I need you to go out there and THROW THAT FINAL PUNCH!" ''[Turns Leni's face towards her.]'' "TAKE MAYOR DAVIS DOWN, GOT IT?!"<br>
''[Leni nods and approaches the stage, greeting her supporters.]''<br>
'''Crowd:''' ''[still chanting]'' "OMGosh! OMGosh!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "'OMGosh' is right! Like, can we talk for a sec about how Mayor Davis is-"<br>
'''Crowd member 1:''' "Really bad at mayoring?!"<br>
''[The crowd jeer in incense.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Uh, no. I was gonna say-"<br>
'''Crowd member 2:''' "A loud sneezer we should shun forever?!"<br>
''[The audience is even more incensed. One of them is holding a 'No' sign over Mayor Davis' head and another breaks an electrical with her head.]''<br>
'''Crowd:''' ''[chanting]'' "Shun her forever! Shun her forever!"<br>
''[As the audience keeps chanting, Lola approaches Leni on the podium]''<br>
'''Lola:''' "How great is this going, huh? Girl, you've got it in the bag now!"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Whispering]'' "This doesn't feel right. It feels icky!"<br>
'''Lola:''' "Icky is good! Icky wins the race!"<br>
'''Crowd:''' ''[chanting]'' "She's the worst! She's the worst!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "No, stop! Mayor Davis is not the worst!"<br>
''[The crowd stops chanting]''<br>
'''Crowd member 2:''' "What?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "She may have run a nasty campaign, but Mayor Davis is a really nice person, and she's done a lot of awesome things for Royal Woods, like cleaning up Tall Timbers Park and founding the annual cherry pit spit. You all love spitting pits, remember?" ''[The crowd silences and agrees]'' "If anyone's the worst, it's me. I said a bunch of mean and untrue stuff, and I'm sorry. It's not who I am. From now on, my campaign is just about fun new ideas, whether I win or lose. Swearsies!"<br>
''[The crowd disperses]''<br>
'''Scoots:''' "Boo! You're weak, Loud!" ''[Wheels away.]''
----
''[Back at the Loud House, Leni lies on her bed and listening to the news on her phone.]''<br>
'''Announcer:''' "And a big congratulations to Theresa Davis, who has won a very close race to be re-elected Mayor of Royal Woods."<br>
''[Leni sighs. Her parents arrive in her bedroom.]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Hey, hon. Your mom and I just came to say we're so ding-dang proud of you."<br>
'''Leni:''' "But I lost the election."<br>
'''Rita:''' "Sure, but you realized staying true to yourself was more important than winning."<br>
'''Leni:''' "In that case, I'm proud of me, too."<br>
''[Her parents hug her.]''
----
''[Royal Woods Mall, Leni is about to cut the ribbon for Mayor Davis]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "OK, mayor, here are the scissors for the ribbon-cutting. I painted them pink to coordinate with your outfit."<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' "Leni, you're the best intern and a formidable opponent. The way you ran your campaign, it inspired me. I fired Vic. No more dirty tricks for this gal."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Swearsies?"<br>
'''Mayor Davis:''' "Swearsies." ''[Giggles]'' "Folks, I'm proud to announce Royal Woods Mall's very first no-tax shopping day, but I can't take credit for this fun new idea. Leni, would you do the honors?"<br>
''[Leni cuts the ribbon, and the crowd cheers]''<br>
'''Vic:''' ''[skulking nearby while the Gila monster tries to eat the yogurt]'' "I should have just run for mayor myself. You'd vote for old tricky Vic, wouldn't you, buddy?"<br>
''[He pulls the tray of yogurts away, but the lizard attacks him, causing him to scream. The yogurts drop to the floor.]''
