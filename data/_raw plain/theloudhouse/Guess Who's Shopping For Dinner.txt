''[Open on a Phoebe Powers trailer.]''<br>
'''Trailer Narrator:''' "The following movie is rated A for awesome. Because Phoebe Powers is back. The first time, she drove them out of town...”<br>
''[A van flies over a raised bridge, and the hooligans inside laugh.]''<br>
'''Bad Guy #1:''' "It's like taking candy from a baby.”<br>
''[The male driver laughs a rather female-pitched laugh, then takes off his mask, revealing himself to be Phoebe Powers.]''<br>
'''Phoebe:''' "Goo-goo ga-ga.”<br>
''[Phoebe ejects herself, and the bad guy freaks out when he sees where the van is headed. He jumps out before they hit a dead end.]''<br>
'''Trailer Narrator:''' "The second time, was no day at the beach.”<br>
''[A woman is at a skate rental on the pier when a man on a scooter steals her purse.]''<br>
'''Woman:''' "Hey! That guy stole my purse!”<br>
''[The rental servicer takes off his mask, revealing himself to be Phoebe Powers.]''<br>
'''Phoebe:''' "You just made a big mis''skate''.”<br>
''[She throws some skates in the robber's direction, which explode when they hit him.]''<br>
'''Woman:''' "Yay!”<br>
''[Her purse lands in her hand. Phoebe makes a bird call, and an eagle swoops in and takes her away.]''<br>
'''Trailer Narrator:''' "And this time… It's about to get ruff!”<br>
''[An evil scientist laughs maniacally into a walkie-talkie.]''<br>
'''Super Villain:''' "You have twenty-four hours to send me all the money in the world, or I'm launching the president's dog into space!”<br>
''[Right next to him, a giant rocket with the president's dog tied to it is waiting for liftoff. The poor dog howls and the villain laughs, when suddenly the doorbell rings.]''<br>
'''Super Villain:''' "Come in?”<br>
''[It's a pizza delivery guy.]''<br>
'''Pizza Delivery Guy:''' "Uh, did somebody order a large pepperoni with a side of…”<br>
''[The delivery guy takes off his mask, revealing himself to be...]''<br>
'''Phoebe:''' "'''''Pain?'''''”<br>
''[Lunges forward with her fist ready. The villain screams, and there's an explosion as she hits him.]''<br>
'''Trailer Narrator:''' "'''''Phoebe Powers in… Bark Night.'''''”<br>
''[One more explosion.]''
----
''[Ronnie Anne and SId have been watching the trailer on Ronnie Anne's laptop.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Gah! This movie looks amazing!”<br>
'''Sid:''' "And in three hours, we'll be sitting front row at the sneak preview.”<br>
''[Rosa enters the room.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mija, I need your help shopping for dinner tonight. Sergio usually helps carry the groceries, but he's throwing a birthday party for Sancho.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Flies in and squawks]'' "Party's gonna be pumpin', puddle water and dumpster fries." ''[drops Ronnie Anne an invite.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I'd love to help you shop, Abuela, but Sid and I are seeing this movie today, and Phoebe Powers is showing up afterwards to sign autographs.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ronalda, please, I really need your help. This shouldn't take long.”<br>
'''Sid:''' "Don't worry, you can use the ''Bark Night'' app to make sure you're on time.”<br>
''[Shows the app.]''<br>
'''Super Villain:''' "The movie starts in three hours, you don't want to miss it. For the dog's sake.” ''[Laughs]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Okay, Abuela, I'm in.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Great, here's the recipe list for tonight's dinner, we're just getting a few things. I'm making caldo de siete mares, soup of the seven seas.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Seven? How about we make it soup of the ''two'' seas?”<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Laughs]'' "''No.''”
----
''[Later, in the mercado, Rosa and Ronnie Anne are looking at the limes.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Great cooking starts with the best ingredients. First, we need limes.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Picks one up]'' "This one looks good.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Inspects it closely with green paint swatches.]'' "No no, the perfect lime has to be the right shade of green.” ''[Picks it up]'' "Has to have the perfect smell.” ''[Smells it]'' "And finally, the right bounce.”<br>
''[She goes long. It breaks open a piñata and whacks Bobby as he's putting cereal away. Carl laughs at this, but gets smacked by the lime too. Rosa catches it.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Yeah, no good. We're going to have to check each one.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "But there's like a hundred limes here.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Holding a dolly with three crates of limes.]'' "Two hundred.”<br>
''[The ''Bark Night'' app goes off.]''<br>
'''Super Villain:''' "Two and a half hours until I launch this pooch into space.” ''[Laughs]''<br>
----
''[Later, Rosa and Ronnie Anne are on the GLART.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Next up, my spice guy.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Great, where is he?”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Four-hundred and seventy-fifth street.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "But we're on fifth. ''Noooooo!''”<br>
''[She cries out as they are taken very far uptown.]''
----
''[Later, they are on top of a building, staring at a little sprout.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What are we looking at here?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ssh! The calls for fresh epazote, so we have to wait for it to bloom, and pick it at just the right time.” ''[gets her clippers ready]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Sighs]'' "At this rate, there's no way I'm gonna make the movie.”<br>
''[Rosa gets a phone call from Sergio, and she answers. She turns to video call.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Hola, Sergio.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Got a problem.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Horrified by what's behind Sergio.]'' "'''AYE!''' ''What did you do?!'' Are those FIREWORKS?!”<br>
''[...some of which go off.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Long story. HURRY!” ''[Hangs up]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mija! You'll have to finish without me. But you must follow my instructions precisely.” ''[gives her the book]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No problem, Abuela.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[kisses Ronnie Anne]'' "Gracias, Ronalda!”<br>
''[Rosa goes off to deal with Sergio as the ''Bark Night'' app goes off again.]''<br>
'''Super Villain:''' "Almost time to pound this hound.” ''[...with one hour left and counting.]'' "Grab your popcorn now.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I'll never get all of these ingredients in time. Unless I go to the Hi 'n' Buy, I mean ingredients are ingredients. Right?” ''[Tosses the clippers and just picks the herb.]'' "Good enough.”<br>
''[Takes off]''
----
''[Back on their street, at the Hi 'n' Buy...]''<br>
'''Automatic Voice:''' "Welcome to the Hi 'n' Buy.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[runs in...]'' "Hi.” ''[...and out with the bags]'' "And bye!”<br>
''[Every single pigeon in the neighborhood is entering the apartment.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Come right in, the party is this way. Make way for the birthday boy!”<br>
''[Two pigeons fly in carrying Sancho on a cheese throne.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Enters]'' "Hey Sancho, feliz cumpleaños.” ''[Enters the kitchen]'' "Here you go, Abuela, all the ingredients exactly how you wanted them.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Que rápida, muchacha. How'd you do it so fast?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Uh, your instructions were just so good. Anyway, I gotta go to the theater.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Of course! Go, go. Y muchas gracias, Mija. Tonight's dinner is so important.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Returns]'' "Wait, what?”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "A local food critic is coming here tonight to judge me for "the city's best home cook".”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What?!”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I didn't want to say anything and get everyone's hopes up, but I'm pretty sure with these ingredients I may just win this thing.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Nervously sweating, laughs.]'' "Right.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Aye! I have to start prepping! He'll be here at six.” ''[Pinches her nieta's cheek]'' "Thanks again, my little saviour.”<br>
''[On the dinner table, Sancho is breakdancing, the other birds cheering him on.]''
----
''[At the theater, Ronnie Anne takes her seat next to her amiga.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "You made it - trailers haven't even started yet. So you got all your shopping done?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yeah, I didn't do it exactly how Abuela asked. But, hey, ingredients are ingredients, right?”<br>
'''Sid:''' "I guess. Ooh, trailers.”<br>
'''Trailer Narrator:''' "In a world of lies...” ''[Ronnie Anne guiltily laughs. Later.]'' "In a world of broken promises...” ''[Ronnie Anne feels even more guilty. Later.]'' "In a world of aliens...”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Phew, thank goodness.”<br>
'''Trailer Narrator:''' "One girl will break her grandmother's heart.”<br>
''[This touches a nerve within Ronnie Anne; she's guilty, and she can't take it anymore.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "''GAH!!!'' Sid, I'm sorry, but I gotta go.” ''[Leaves]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "What about the movie? And meeting Phoebe Powers?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I'm sorry, but I was wrong - ingredients aren't ingredients.”<br>
'''Sid:''' "Okay, but I'll miss you.”<br>
----
''[Ronnie Anne leaves the theatre and takes out her phone.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Come on, pick up, Abuela. You can't use those bad ingredients.”<br>
''[Rosa's phone rings, and then gets dumpster fries dumped on them. The birds are too busy rooting for Sancho to hit the street cat piñata.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[frustrated]'' "'''''GAAAAAAH!!!''''' Okay, think. Abuela said her dinner is at six - I've still got time to get the right ingredients.”<br>
''[Takes out the recipe book.]''<br>
'''Rosa's Voice:''' "'''For caldo siete mares, you need seven kinds of seafood, and for the best seafood, go to the fish market. Dottie sells the best catfish and talapia.'''”<br>
'''Dottie:''' "I sell the best catfish and talapia! Catfish and talapia coming up!”<br>
'''Rosa's Voice:''' "'''If you want to buy it, you gotta catch it. She used to be a ball player.'''”<br>
''[Dottie hits the fish with a baseball bat.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I got it!”<br>
''[Then she gets hit with them - two ingredients down. Later, at the mussels booth...]''<br>
'''Rosa's Voice:''' "'''If you want the best mussels, you have to beat Muscles in an arm-wrestling competition.'''” ''[Ronnie Anne arm-wrestles the very large man.]'' "'''P.S. - he gets easily distracted.'''”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hey, hey, look! They're giving out free protein shakes.”<br>
''[Muscles looks, and Ronnie Anne pins him. Score! He gives her the mussels - rhree ingredients down. Later, at the shrimp stand...]''<br>
'''Rosa's Voice:''' "'''The perfect jumbo shrimp is shaped like a boomerang...'''” ''[which one shrimp is...]'' "'''...and should act like one too.'''” ''[Ronnie Anne picks up the shrimp and throws it, which causes some trouble offscreen, but returns, with someone's hat - four ingredients down.]''<br>
----
''[Ronnie Anne is now observing something.]''<br>
'''Rosa's Voice:''' "'''Make sure you buy baby octopus, not older.'''”<br>
''[One octopus is elderly, the next one seems to be in its rebellious teen years, but the final one is a baby. Ronnie Anne goes for the latter - five ingredients down.]''
----
''[Next up, the clams.]''<br>
'''Rosa's Voice:''' "'''If you want the clams to open up for you, you have to open up for the clams, tell them a secret.'''”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne whispers a secret to the clams, and they gasp open.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "'''''You better not tell <u>anyone</u>.'''''"<br>
''[She obtains the clams - six ingredients down.]''<br>
'''Rosa's Voice:''' "'''And finally, the squid. Don't forget your scuba gear.'''”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne is in the squid tank with her mask, flippers, and snorkel, and a squid clinging to her head, and it inks - seven ingredients down.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I did it! I got it all! And with plenty of time.” ''[Closes the book, but notices something.]'' "Wait, why is there writing on the back?”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Actually, let's make it siete mares with a twist. Crab legs.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Okay, it's fine, I've still got time.”<br>
''[Just then, the fish market closes.]''<br>
'''Loudspeaker:''' "You ''are'' out of time. The fish market is closed.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne sighs, then gets a phone call.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hi, Abuela.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mija, I'm sorry I missed your call, it's been crazy here.”<br>
''[There's a banging at the door.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "It's the pigeon po-po! I was never here!” ''[Flies away]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Is everything okay, Ronalda?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No, I lied to you, I knew I wouldn't have enough time to get your ingredients and make my movie, so I went to the Hi 'n' Buy.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Que, que!”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I know, I left the movie and tried to get the right stuff, but I couldn't get the crab legs.” ''[The call ends]'' "Abuela?”<br>
''[The mercado van drives up to her. Rosa is driving, wearing dark shades.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Get in.”<br>
----
''[Ronnie Anne fastens her seatbelt and Rosa floors it.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "There's the crab truck!”<br>
''[They are in hot persuit of it.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Look out! BRIDGE!”<br>
''[The bridge ahead of them is rising, and Rosa drives right over it - just like in the trailer. Ronnie Anne is screaming for dear life and they land. However, a tire snaps off! The van is immobile.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "It's getting away!”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "We'll see about that!”<br>
''[Rosa takes a chancla out of her purse and throws it. It flies past the truck and hits the walk button on the stoplight, changing it to red. The truck driver stops.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Q'bole Crabby, let me get half a pound of your best stuff, por favor.” ''[Crabby obliges - eight ingredients down.]'' "Good thing we have a spare tire in the trunk.”<br>
''[The entire van blows up.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh no! Now we'll never get to our building in time.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Don't worry Mija, I have some friends who owe me a favour.”<br>
''[Does a bird call, and Sergio and the pigeons fly in and carry Rosa and Ronnie Anne back to the building.]''
----
''[Back at the building, Rosa places the caldo on the table.]''<br>
'''Food Critic:''' "Ooh.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I hope you enjoy my caldo de siete mares, Mr. Famous Food Critic.”<br>
''[The critic takes a spoon and prepares to sip. Rosa and Ronnie Anne grow nervous. With every second the spoon closes in on the critic's mouth, Rosa grows even more nervous; sweating, and biting her lip. The critic sips...]''<br>
'''Food Critic:''' "Wow! This is the best siete mares caldo, I've ever had, there's no contest, Mrs. Casagrande.” ''[Takes out the trophy]'' "You are officially the city's best home cook.”<br>
''[Rosa and Ronnie Anne cheer.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I am so happy for you, Abuela!”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Thank you, Mija, I'm sorry you had to miss your action movie though.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Are you kidding? A high speed chase to get crab legs, fighting a squid, and wrestling for muscles. I didn't miss the movie, I lived it, I'd help you shop for dinner anytime, Abuela.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Gracias, but I still feel bad you didn't get to meet Phoebe Powers.”<br>
'''Food Critic:''' "We'll see about that.”<br>
''[The food critic takes his mask off, revealing himself to be Phoebe Powers in person.]''<br>
'''Rosa and Ronnie Anne:''' "Phoebe Powers!?”<br>
'''Rosa:''' "What are you doing here?”<br>
'''Phoebe:''' "I was in town for the movie screening, and when I'm not acting I'm a secret food critic. Speaking of food, I have to know how you and your grandmother find such great ingredients.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Gasps]'' We could show you. Abuela, could we go get stuff for tomorrow's breakfast? Please?”<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Dawns her shades]'' "Let's do this.”
----
''[Later, they are all back in the van, driving over a raised bridge. They stick the landing.]''<br>
'''Phoebe:''' "Wow! Even I don't do my own stunts!”<br>
''[THE END]''
