{{Transcript}}
''[Great Lakes City Park. Ronnie Anne skates along the park, with Vito sleeping and Laird trying to stop his kite from flying, but is dragged away.]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "Ah... Ahhh!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[To Arturo]'' "I'm working on a new trick, Dad! I call it "vertigo", because it makes the person watching me super dizzy."<br>
''[She proceeds to do the trick, spinning haphazardly and eventually crashing off-screen. Arturo runs to Ronnie Anne's aid.]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "That made me worried more than dizzy, but you'll get there."<br>
''[He gives her a wink and a thumb-up; the camera zooms out to reveal she crashed at Bruno's hot dog stand.]''<br>
'''Bruno:''' "Hey, nice moves, Ronnie Anne! Let me guess: two dogs dragged through the garden?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yep. Thanks, Bruno."<br>
''[She gets up and dusts herself off; Bruno prepares her hot dog.]''<br>
'''Bruno:''' "No charge. Just vote for me at the Great Lakes City hot dog contest tomorrow." ''[He gives Ronnie Anne her hot dog; he has given two.]'' "Winner gets two tickets to Vienna for a sausage tasting tour." ''[Bubbly eyed]'' "It's my dream trip."<br>
'''Arturo:''' “No hotdogs for me. I'm a judge and I must not allow myself to be influenced.” ''[The aroma snaps at Arturo, caresses him, ushers him forward]'' “But, it smells... so good." ''[Angrily to himself clenching his fists]'' "Be strong, Arturo.”<br>
''[Stuffs two pinecones in his nose]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Eats both hotdogs; stuffed mouth]'' “Yeah, you're definitely gonna win.”<br>
'''Vito:''' ''[Arrives with his dogs]'' “Of course he will. Bruno's hotdogs are the best in the city. We'll take the usual, please.”<br>
'''Bruno:''' “Three dogs with bad breath.”<br>
''[Reaches into his cart and comes out wearing a gas mask and holding three hotdogs. He tosses them into Vito, Big Tony, and Little Sal's mouths. They sigh, their smelly breath, unsettling. Ronnie Anne is revolted by the smell and stuffs two pinecones up her own nose]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Offscreen, unhappy]'' “Bruno!” ''[Approaches Bruno with a half-eaten hotdog]'' “You put way too much relish on my hotdog. I demand a refund!”<br>
'''Bruno:''' “Sorry, Maybelle. After the second bite, you own it.”<br>
'''Maybelle:''' “You'll hear from my lawyer!”<br>
''[Drops the hotdog and storms off. Arturo is about to eat the hotdog off the ground]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Dad! Remember you're a judge.”<br>
'''Arturo:''' “Fine. ¡Hasta mañana Bruno.”<br>
''[The Santiagos leave. Bruno waves goodbye. Laird flies past being dragged by his kite]''
----
''[The next day, Ronnie Anne is showing her new trick to CJ, Carl, Sergio and Lalo]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “I call it 'vertigo'.”<br>
''[She tries, but falls over again]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “I call it a fail.” ''[Gives a thumb-down]''<br>
''[Ronnie Anne spirals when suddenly Bruno runs up to them]''<br>
'''Bruno:''' ''[Panicking]'' “Hey kids, you haven't seen my hotdog cart around here have you? It's got four wheels, an umbrella, smells like hotdogs.”<br>
''[None of them know where it is]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "I didn't do it."<br>
'''CJ:''' "No."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “What happened?”<br>
'''Bruno:''' ''[Sighs]'' “Ronnie Anne, after you and your dad left yesterday, I took my afternoon bathroom break, and when I got back, it was gone!”<br>
''[The kids and pets gasp]''<br>
'''Vito:''' ''[Runs up]'' “Bruno! Where you's been? We need our usual.”<br>
'''Bruno:''' “There's no more usual, Vito. Looks like my cart's been stolen.”<br>
'''Vito:''' “No hotdogs!? ''[Together with his dogs howling]'' ''No''!”<br>
''[He and his dachshunds start crying]''<br>
'''Bruno:''' “'Fraid so. Now I can't compete in the contest. Guess I'll never make it to Vienna now.”<br>
'''Vito:''' “Tough break, Bruno. We'll get through this together.” ''[Sobs]'' "No more hotdog."<br>
''[He and Bruno walk away together]''<br>
'''CJ:''' “That's so sad.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “We have to help him find his cart.”<br>
''[Carl gasps in excitement. He dons a trenchcoat, tie, and fedora]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Sounds like a job for… Detective Carl. Step into my office.” ''[Carl starts off, but steps on Ronnie Anne's skateboard and crashes offscreen]'' “Ouch.”
----
''[Later, in Carl's office]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “First things first, we'll need to determine who was in the park when the cart went missing.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “I saw Laird, Maybelle, Vito and Abuelo.”<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Agitated]'' “Ronnie Anne! ''I'm'' the detective. As I was about to say…” ''[Pulls down a screen]'' “The suspects are Laird, Maybelle, Vito and Abuelo.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Maybelle did seem really upset.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “My money's on Hector.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “We'll have to question everyone.”<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Mad]'' “Ronnie Anne! That's my line!” ''[Punches his desk, and his façade falls on him]'' ”A little help please.”
----
''[In the secret room, Carl is questioning someone]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Threateningly]'' “Where were you yesterday at approximately four p.m?" ''[Bangs his hands on the desk.]'' "Hm? Stealing a hotdog cart?!”<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Hands shaking in fear]'' “I didn't do it. I got stuck in a tree while I was flying my kite. Look, someone even recorded it and posted it online.”<br>
''[They watch the video of Laird flying off on his kite and eventually hitting a tree; the kite ties him and he is now held upside down.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Slamming Carl's head down]'' “Ooh! that's gonna go viral!”<br>
''[Later, suspect number two]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' “I was down the street at Cheesy's Pizza returning a slice. There was too much cheese.”<br>
''[Maybelle shows them the slice. Carl snatches it]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Likely story. CJ.”<br>
''[CJ bites the end of the pizza and walks out of the secret room, the cheese stretches and doesn't break]''<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Gives a thumb up.]'' “Her story checks out.”
----
''[Later, Vito and his dogs are still crying]''<br>
'''Vito:''' “Oh jeez. I don't know what I'll do without those hotdogs.<br>
''[Keeps sobbing. The primos look at each other]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Annoyed]'' “Yeah, yeah, alright, you're clear. Get out of here.”
----
''[Next, Hector has the light in his face, and is nervously sweating]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “Bruno's hotdog cart? How should I know? I was napping.” ''[Loosens his collar]'' “Ooh, is it hot in here? Or is it just me? I mean, it's not me. I didn't do it!” ''[Flatulates]'' “Sorry, I get gassy when I'm nervous.”<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Presses his sticky lollipop against Hector's nose]'' “Smells to me like you're lying. If you are, you're gonna regret it.”<br>
''[Carl pulls his lolly off, causing Hector to grab his nose and yelp in pain. Hector farts again]''
----
''[In the mercado, Ronnie Anne, CJ, and Carl contemplate the suspects]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Laird, Maybelle and Vito seem to be innocent.”<br>
'''Carl:''' “That leaves Abuelo, he's definitely hiding something. But what?”<br>
''[Just then, Bobby enters with a hotdog. Which Sergio tries to steal]'<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “Thanks for the snack.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “Hey! That's my hotdog.” ''[Starts fighting over it]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Bobby! Where'd you get that dog?”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “It's a mercado dog. Abuelo's been perfecting his recipe for the hotdog competition.”<br>
''[Sergio let's go, sending Bobby flying out the door]''<br>
'''CJ:''' “Abuelo's competing too?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Maybe he got rid of Bruno to eliminate the competition.”<br>
'''Carl:''' “''Or'' he got rid of Bruno to eliminate the competition.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne slaps her face]''<br>
'''CJ:''' “How can we be sure?<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “We'll have to find proof.”<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[About to take credit again]'' “''Or''...” ''[Everyone's already left, leaving him disgraced.]'' “Ah! Come on!”
----
''[Later, in the apartment, Hector walks along, minding his own business, and lets one rip. Carl collects the gas in a jar. He inserts a probe to analyze the contents, except the gas reeks of cheese. Later, while Hector is napping in his chair, Lalo and Sergio sneak up to him. Sergio looks in Hector's mouth but gets stuck. He escapes but with Hector's teeth clamped to his head. In their Abuelo's bedroom, CJ shakes Hector's guitar and gets a mountain of snacks dumped on him. Later, Carlota is in the living room, working on her laptop. Ronnie Anne is just looking around for anything that might be a clue. She looks under her prima's feet, under a sofa cushion, and realizes that Carlota is editing a video of the park, with Ronnie Anne and her padre in the background at Bruno's cart]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Huh? Carlota, is that from yesterday?”<br>
'''Carlota:''' “Yeah, I'm making a new vlog post on fashion trends at the park.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “But I didn't see you there.”<br>
'''Carlota:''' “One of the trends is camouflage.”<br>
''[In the video, Carlota comes out of the bushes wearing jungle camouflage just as Ronnie and Arturo are leaving and Laird screams while his kite drags him away]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “This is right before Bruno's hotdog cart went missing.” ''[The pets and primos gather around]'' “Carlota, can you zoom in on Bruno's cart? We're trying to bust Abuelo.”<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[A little confused]'' “Okay.”<br>
''[Carlota zooms in and enhances the cart. Bruno takes out a newspaper and goes off for his break. Hector casually approaches the cart]''<br>
'''CJ:''' “There's Abuelo.”<br>
''[Quickly, Hector opens the cart, steals a hotdog, and runs away. Everyone gasps]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Abuelo took a hotdog! That's why he was acting guilty.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “But he didn't take the cart.”<br>
'''CJ:''' “Then who did?”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Look!”<br>
''[The video shows a beefy looking character in a hotdog suit sneaking up to the cart. Everyone gasps again]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' “How did I not see a guy dressed as a hotdog?” ''[The character takes the cart]'' “Love the pickle shoes.”<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Takes the laptop]'' “We find that hotdog, we find Bruno's cart. Let's go!”<br>
''[They race off, leaving Carlota alone]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' “Uh, my computer?”
----
''[On the  streets, Ronnie Anne and her primos are showing a picture to Casey, Nikki, Sameer, Margarita and the pizza chef]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Has anyone seen this hotdog?”<br>
''[Everyone shakes their head and walks away. Everyone is bummed until Sancho hops by wearing a pickle shoe]''<br>
'''CJ:''' “Look a pickle shoe. That's what the hotdog wore.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “Follow that bird!”<br>
''[Everyone cuts Sancho off]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Fork it over Sancho! That shoe is a clue in our investigation.” ''[Sancho refuses, protecting his pickle shoe. Carl holds something out]'' “Would this bag of chips change your mind?”<br>
''[Sancho agrees and they trade]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Great work, Carl. Lalo can you track the scent?”<br>
''[Lalo sniffs the shoe and points forward]''<br>
'''CJ:''' “He's got it.”<br>
''[CJ and Carl hop on Lalo and CJ puts a police light on Lalo's head]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Takes out a talkie]'' “''Pssh''. We got a four-five-niner, delta, omega, baby shrimp, bubble butt. ''Ssh''. Over.”<br>
''[The camera reveals Ronnie Anne heard that.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Who are you talking to?”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Sorry, that's classified information.”<br>
'''CJ:''' “Hi-ho! Lalo! Away.”<br>
''[Carl and CJ ride off on Lalo. Ronnie Anne takes out her board and helmet and she and Sergio go after them while Sancho enjoys his chips, and burps loudly.]''
----
''[The scent has led them to an abandoned warehouse. Carl kicks in the door]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “We know you're in there, hotdog!”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Look! Bruno's cart.”<br>
'''CJ:''' “And there's the hotdog!”<br>
''[The hotdog is on the mezzanine above the cart. He makes a run for it]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Follow that wiener!”<br>
''[They chase the hotdog through the warehouse. Sergio starts to catch up]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “There's no escape!” ''[The hotdog squirts mustard at Sergio]'' “Ah! I can't see!”<br>
''[Sergio drops. The hotdog then squirts the floor behind him with mustard. Everyone else slips and crashes into some boxes. The hotdog runs again]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Gasps]'' “He's getting away!”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Not if I can help it.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne skates forward and cuts the hotdog off. Without a word the finally nails her new trick]''<br>
'''CJ:''' “Vertigo!”<br>
'''Carl:''' “It's working!”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[As they all get dizzy]'' “It's beautiful.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne continues spinning around the hotdog and it gets dizzy too. The hotdog drops to the floor as Ronnie Anne finishes and takes a bow]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “This hotdog's cooked.”<br>
''[The hotdog sits up and Ronnie Anne removes the mask]''<br>
'''Everyone:''' “Vito?”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Oh yeah, I knew it all along.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Why Vito? You're Bruno's best customer. You love his hotdogs more than anything.”<br>
'''Vito:''' “That's why I did it. If Bruno wins and goes to Vienna I'll have to go a whole month without his hotdogs.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “But you're crushing Bruno's dream.”<br>
'''Vito:''' “I know, I know, I was wrong. I came back to get the cart, I was gonna return it. I hope I'm not too late.”<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Checks his watch]'' “The contest starts in five minutes.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “We can still make it. Let's go!”<br>
''[They hurry off with the cart]''
----
''[At the hotdog contest, Arturo is tasting the second contender's hotdog, Par holding his spit bucket]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' “Thank you for your-” ''[Burps]'' “Famous, burp dog. Next, we have… Hector's mercado dog. Beautiful colour, the buns are warm and fluffy. Now for the taste.” ''[Arturo eats the hotdog, tastes it thoroughly, and spits into the bucket]'' “Fantastico! Eight out of ten!” ''[Hector growls at him]'' “Did I say eight? I meant nine.”<br>
'''Hector:''' “Who made this bobo a judge?”<br>
'''Arturo:''' “Well, if there are no more hotdogs to taste…” ''[Bruno looks sadly at his Vienna brochure]'' “...I'll announce the results. Ant the winner is…”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne''' “Waaaait!” ''[The kids roll up with Bruno's cart]'' “Did somebody order a hotdog?”<br>
'''Bruno:''' “My cart! You found it!”<br>
'''Vito:''' ''[Catches up, out of breath]'' “Whoa! Man, I should cut down on hotdogs.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Drag one through the garden, Bruno.”<br>
''[Bruno winks. He takes out a bun and a dog and tosses them in the air, the land together. He adds the mustard, ketchup, the rest of the garden, and kisses a pickle as he crowns the hotdog with it]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' “Our final contestant… Bruno!” ''[Takes the hotdog]'' “I love what you did with the toppings.” ''[Takes a bite]'' “Delicioso! A perfect ten! Bruno wins!”<br>
''[Everyone cheers for Bruno]''<br>
'''Bruno:''' “I can't believe it! My dreams have come true. And it's all because of my dear friends. Thank you kids.”<br>
''[Hector taps Bruno's shoulder]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “I owe you for a hotdog.”<br>
''[Gives Bruno the money for the hotdog he stole. Bruno takes it]''<br>
'''Vito:''' “Bruno, I took the cart. I didn't want to live without your hotdogs for a whole month. I'm sorry. Go to Vienna, I'll survive on Hector's eight out of ten hotdogs.”<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Offscreen]'' “It was a nine!”<br>
'''Bruno:''' “Ah, Vito, buddy, you shouldn't have done that. But you know, I'd never leave you hanging.” ''[Takes out the tickets]'' “I was gonna bring you to Vienna the whole time.”<br>
'''Vito:''' “Are you's kidding me? Unbelievable this guy. Come here you.”<br>
''[They hug]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “I'll carry your bags.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Good work guys, case closed.”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Ronnie Anne! That's my line!”<br>
''[Throws down his hat. Episode ends with a postcard from Vito and Bruno. With Sergio fighting with Little Sal over a hotdog]''
