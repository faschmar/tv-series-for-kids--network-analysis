''[We open on a book whose cover is graced by the appearance of a happy fish. We hold on the cover for a few seconds.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' ''[narrating]'' "''Once upon a time, thousands of years ago...''"<br>
''[The book opens to reveal an ancient Chinese village, its happy residents doing their own things; one of which is fishing.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "''...our ancestors lived in Clear Water Village. They farmed the land and enjoyed a peaceful life...''"<br>
''[We pan right to reveal the other side of the village.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "''Until one day, the village was attacked...''" ''[page turn]'' "''By the infamous Han Family Bandits!''"<br>
''[The villagers are scared. The Han Family Bandits consist of three people; a burly, tough man in the middle, a much shorter man to his left, and a woman with a slender build to his right.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' ''[as the bandits]'' "'Hand over all your food or we will destroy your village!'"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[cutting in]'' "Oh, no! And then they destroyed it?"<br>
''[We cut to the Chang apartment, where Stanley is telling the tale to his daughters, Breakfast Bot, and the Chang pets.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "''Ssh!'' Dad's getting to that!" ''[turning to Stanley]'' "Dad, can you get to that?"<br>
'''Stanley:''' "As I was saying, our calm, wise..."<br>
''[Page flip and we cut back to the tale; the Chang ancestor bears a striking resemblance to Stanley.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "''And VERY handsome Ancestor Chang, who...''" ''[back to reality]'' "...''some'' say looks a lot like me, heh heh..."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "''Focus'', Dad!"<br>
''[Stanley clears his throat.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "He realized that the Han family's hunger had driven them to a life of crime. So, he offered them a challenge..."<br>
''[Back to the story.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "''...if he gave them something more delicious...''"
''[The camera pans from Ancestor Chang's face to him holding a bowl with five bao, incidentally shaped like fish like in the book's cover.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "''...than anything they'd ever tasted, they'd have to spare the village.''" ''[pan to the bandits, who are scoffing]'' "''The bandits scoffed, but when Ancestor Chang gave them his goldfish bao...''"<br>
''[Pageflip; the bandits are awestruck, filled, and strong.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "''...it delighted their eyes, filled their stomachs, and energized their bodies! The bandits lost the challenge!''"<br>
''[Pageflip again, this time to the bandits, who have seemingly reformed, now standing triumphantly surrounded by a group of happy villagers.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "''The Han family was so moved, that they gave up their evil ways and became the protectors of Clear Water Village!''"<br>
''[Pageflip to the winning recipe.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "''And THAT'S the story of how THIS bao recipe saved the day.''"<br>
''[Stanley holds up a winning bao, which sparkles; the girls and pets look in intrigue.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "It's been passed down through our family for generations."<br>
'''The other Changs:''' "Ooh!"<br>
'''Stanley:''' ''[to the girls]'' "And now, it's time for me to pass the recipe down to ''you'' two, so ''you'' can make bao for the Chinese Cultural Fair today." ''[he sniffles a bit; now voice breakign with tears streaming down his face]'' "My little buns, making their first buns..."<br>
''[Sid pats his back, touched.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Aw, Dad..."
----------
''[The scene cuts Sid and Adelaide attempting to make the buns. Sid places some purple filling on her bun. A few spots of filling dot her face and hair. Adelaide has already placed some of her bun.]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "Sid, too much filling. Adelaide, not enough filling. Each fin needs eight lines and eight is lucky, not seven, not nine, but eight."<br>
'''Sid:''' "I don't think it matters how many--"<br>
'''Stanley:''' ''[Cutting Sid off.]'' It matters. These baos saved our ancestor's village, so we have to make them ''[clenches his fist]'' the ''right'' way. Especially because I need to outsell Mike Liu's zongzi stand."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "There. Finally. That looks amazing." ''[She holds up a perfectly formed bao cookie.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Oh, oh, oh! I did it too!" <br>
''[She holds up her own bao. Stanley picks them up and holds them in his hands, feeling for their weight, before grabbing a magnifier and examining it in more detail]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "Perfect! Good job, girls."<br>
'''Sid and Adelaide:''' ''[Raising their arms in delight]'' "Yay!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Hit it, Marcel!" ''[Marcel gives a thumbs-up and presses a button on Breakfast-Bot, causing him to play triumphant music. The sisters and their pets dance to the rhythm.]''"Oh yeah! We rock!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Mastered it!"<br>
'''Stanley:''' ''[Switches off the music]'' "Dance party later. I gotta go to the park and snag the best spot before Mike Liu gets there. ''[chuckles]'' Oh, and I'm gonna need you to make eight hundred bao just like those two."<br>
''[He leaves, leaving Sid and Adelaide looking shocked at the demands. After a while, Sid weakly chuckles.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "It sounded like he said eight hundred."<br>
'''Stanley:''' ''[Popping back through the door]'' "I did. Better get started. See you at the park." ''[He leaves again, shutting the door.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "But it took us forever to make two!"<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Whining]'' "At this rate, we'll be ''Dad's'' age by the time we finish! There HAS to be a better way!"<br>
''[Cam slithers over and begins licking the filling off of Sid's cheek. Meanwhile, Breakfast-Bot and the other pets are playing a game of mahjong. Then, Sid gets an idea.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "That's it!"<br> 
----
''[Later, Marcel takes a clump of dough and puts it on a conveyor belt. Cam flattens it with his tail. Froggy 2 takes some filling with his tongue and drops it on the dough. Nico shapes the dough, leaving some hair behind. Adelaide and Sid brush the bao and Breakfast Bot takes it and puts it in a pot, he is already steaming some bao]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Are you sure Dad will be okay with us taking a shortcut like this?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Let's just not tell him. Hm..." ''[Picks one up and looks at it closely, it looks dirty, finless and hairy]'' "Close enough. Let's speed it up." ''[Sid sets Breakfast Bot to fast mode. The conveyer belt speeds up so fast that Froggy 2 and Nico can't keep up. Cut to Marcel and Cam, whom also can't keep up. Marcel tips the whole bowl of dough onto the conveyor belt. Nico and Froggy 2 start panicking and Nico dumps all the filling onto the line of dough. Breakfast Bot starts getting buried in dough. Sid gasps]'' "Guys, you're falling behind!"<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' ''[Getting overwhelmed]'' "Warning, disaster imminent. Warning, warning, warning, warnign!"<br>
''[Breakfast Bot starts sparking and sends a bolt of electricity at Stanley's book. The book opens to the page with the angry bandits, who suddenly disappear from the book. The whole building sparks up and suddenly a swirling purple cloud emerges above. Suddenly, the three bandits drop from the cloud and hit the streets. They let out a roar. Meanwhile, in the Chang's apartment, Breakfast Bot is broken and the girls are completely unaware of what just happened outside]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Breakfast Bot, are you okay?"<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Define, 'okay'."<br>
'''Sid:''' "On the plus side, the bao's done."<br>
''[The girls high five. But cringe when Breakfast Bot drops]''
----
''[The girls and Breakfast Bot bring the bao outside and are walking along when they see something]''<br>
'''Hipster Male:''' ''[Offscreen]'' "One for the vloooog." ''[He and his girlfriend are taking a selfie with the Han Family Bandits. The bandits are disoriented by the flash]'' "Man, you're costumes look really real."<br>
''[The bandits roar at them]''<br>
'''Hipster Woman:''' ''[Sniffs]'' "And smell really real." ''[They walk off, pinching their noses]'' "Eww."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Dad's cultural association must've hired historical reenactors for the fair. They look just like the bandits from the story!"<br>
''[Suddenly a burly hand grabs Adelaide. She yelps]''<br>
'''Hui:''' "Hand over all your food or we'll destroy your village."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Not buying it]'' "Your acting's okay, but your moustache looks really fake."<br>
''[She starts yanking at Woo's moustache and rips some of it off. He drops her and screams in pain. Then he growls]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Those are not reenactors. They ''are'' the bandits from the story."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "What do you mean, Breakfast Bot?"<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "If my optical sensors are correct, we accidentally opened a rift in time and space when our bao making went awry. Look!"<br>
''[Points to the swirling purple cloud above them]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Ooh, pretty."<br>
'''Woo:''' ''[Realizes something]'' "Uhâ€¦ This isn't Clear Water village."<br>
'''Hui:''' "We've been lost before, but not this lost. Where are we?"<br>
'''Yi:''' "Who cares? I'm starving! Let's start raiding."<br>
''[Hui and Woo agree]''<br>
'''Sid & Adelaide:''' ''[Gasp]'' "Uh-oh!"<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "If my aural sensors are correct, it sounds like they were going to the village, but the rift brought them here before they got there."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Knowing the rest of the story]'' "And it sounds like they missed lunch."<br>
''[The bandits start screaming and charge]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "If we don't feed them, they'll destroy the city!"<br>
''[Offscreen, objects start clattering. Georgia is drinking a coffee, when a whip snags it and takes it. Yi tries it and immediately spits it out]''<br>
'''Yi:''' "Blegh! That's disgusting!"<br>
''[Meanwhile, Hui is warming up his nunchucks, Vito watches, eating a sausage]''<br>
'''Vito:''' "Oh, bunch of tough guys, huh?" ''[Vito starts swinging his linked sausages around, impressively at first, but only manages to snare himself]'' "Is it over? Did I win?"<br>
''[Meanwhile, Woo is wrestling with Maybelle over her grocery bag]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "You ain't gettin' these mangos."<br>
''[Kicks Woo away]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "I got it! Remember Dad's story? We just gotta give them the bao and they'll do whatever we want!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Yeah! Just like Ancestor Chang!"<br>
''[The bandits are beating up the hipster couple, who don't even realize they're actually being attacked]''<br>
'''Hipster Female:''' "Wow! You're really great method actors!"<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Offscreen]'' "Stop!" ''[Everyone looks at her]'' "If we give you something more delicious than anything you've ever tastedâ€¦"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "..Something that delights the eyes, fills the stomach and energizes the body..."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Will you stop doing bandity stuff and go back into the rift?" ''[The bandits think about it, and throw the hipsters away, intrigued by the challenge. The sisters look at each other in excitement.]'' "I present to you... the Changs' secret recipe bao!"<br>
''[Lifts the lid off the pot, revealing the dirty, hairy bao. The bandits try and spit it out in revolt]''<br>
'''Yi:''' "These bao stink!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "What? They can't be ''that'' bad."<br>
''[Sid and Adelaide each take a bao and try for themselves.]''<br>'''Sid and Adelaide:''' "Hmm?"<br>''[They discover that the bao is that bad. They both spit it out.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Pulls a red hairball out of her mouth]'' "Ugh, I found some Nico hair. I guess we shouldn't have taken that shortcut. We have to remake them."<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Whining]'' "That'll take forever!" ''[Realizes something and has an idea]'' "Wait! There's tons of yummy things here in the city." ''[To the bandits]'' "Hey!" ''[The bandits have already taken off, shouting and fighting inside a fight cloud. Sid catches up with them]'' "Waaaait!" ''[The fighting stops]'' "I'm not done yet! I have more food to offer you!"<br>
'''Hui:''' "Fine, we'll give you three more chances, but if you fail, we're taking over this village."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Sure. Let me show you the best eats of Great Lakes City."<br>
''[Takes them to said eats]''
----
''[Later, they are at the pizza restaurant]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Alright, I don't know anyone who doesn't like pizza. Eat up!"<br>
''[The bandits engage in a fight cloud and eat the pizza, they seem to enjoy it]''<br>
'''Hui:''' "This delights the eye and fills the stomach but..."<br>
''[The bandits start growing tired]''<br>
'''Yi:''' "It does not energize the body.."<br>
''[The bandits drop. A few pizza slices land on them.]''
----
''[Next, Sid is showing a hot dog overtopped with salad<!--, one dog dragged through the garden-->.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Hotdogs are a Great Lakes City specialty."<br>
''[The bandits try]''<br>
'''Woo:''' "Fills the stomach."<br>
'''Yi:''' "Energizes the body, but..."<br>
''[They see Vito, who has very poor table manners, eating a hotdog while slobbering with his mouth open]''<br>
'''Han Family:''' ''[Disgusted]'' "Ugh. Does not delight the eye."
''[Hui almost pukes, covering his mouth]''
----
''[Third chance, they are in the arcade. The bandits have ice cream]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Everyone loves ice cream sundaes."<br>
''[The bandits try and this time they enjoy everything about it. They start eating it all at once]''<br>
'''Hui:''' "This is it! It delights the eye!"<br>
'''Woo:''' ''[Sniffs]'' "Fills the stomach."<br>
'''Yi:''' "And energizes the bo--"<br>
''[They freeze and turn completely blue. They then start clutching their heads in excruciating pain]''<br>
'''Woo:''' "There's ice in my brain!"<br>
'''Hui:''' "Augh! It's attacking us!"<br>
'''Yi:''' "What is this cursed magic!?"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "It's just brain freeze. Calm down."<br>
'''Hui:''' ''[Getting the wrong idea, looking at the sisters with a bloodshot eye.]'' "Ah, a sneak attack!" ''[The team angrily confront them.]'' "You lost the challenge. Now we are taking over this village!"<br>
''[They get started]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Wait!" ''[The bandits start raiding the arcade. Hui throws the claw machine out the door and they - as a fight cloud - charge into the streets. Adelaide, Sid, and Breakfast Bot follow them out.]'' "There's only one way to fix this." ''[to Adelaide, annoyed]'' "We need to make the bao exactly like Ancestor Chang did in the story!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "You make the bao. I'll hold them off."<br>
'''Sid:''' "How are you gonna do that?"<br>
''[Adelaide ties her pigtails back and rips off her clothes, revealing her karate gi, and gets into a fighting pose]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "I'm a karate genius, duh. Now, go!"<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Takes off]'' "We'll be right back."<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' ''[Follows Sid]'' "Does she always have that on?"<br>''
[Adelaide - letting off a fierce growl - looks at the bandits - who are smashing a mailbox - and confronts them.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Hey!" ''[Taunts them over]'' "Let's dance."<br>
''[The bandits growl in Adelaide's direction. Meanwhile, back at the apartment building, the rift is still open. Inside the apartment, Sid and Breakfast Bot have their ingredients ready. Sid gets started and the animals salute her, ready to help]''<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Declines]'' "Nope, no more shortcuts. I have to do this the right way." ''[Gets started]'' "This much filing..." ''[Meanwhile, the bandits charge at Adelaide. Adelaide dodges Woo with a split jump, flying side kicks Yi away, then grabs Hui by the boots, slams him on the sidewalk, spins him above her head and throws him. Back at the apartment, Sid has shaped a bao, sweat dripping from her brow, she readies her chopsticks and grooves the lines onto the fins]'' "Eight lines." ''[Inspects closely]'' "Pretty!" ''[Places it with the other two in the pot. She puts the pot on Breakfast Bot]'' "These will steam on the way there. Let's go!"<br>
''[Meanwhile, Adelaide is still holding her own. She split-kicks Woo and Yi, followed by her leg sweeping Hui.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Gets into a pose]'' "Hi-ya!" ''[Suddenly, Yi lashes her whip and snares Adelaide]'' "Huh?"<br>
'''Yi:''' ''[Dangles Adelaide]'' "It's over, child."<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Offscreen]'' "Stooop!" ''[Everyone looks over]'' "You haven't had the perfect Chang family bao!<br>
'''Hui:''' ''[Scoffs]'' "How are these different from the last ones?"<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Opens the pot]'' "Try them and see."<br>
''[Tosses them each a bao, the sight of which awes them]''<br>
'''Yi:''' ''[Gasps]'' "It delights the eye!"<br>
'''Hui:''' ''[Eats]'' "It fills the stomach."<br>
'''Hoo:''' "And energizes the body!"<br>
'''Hui:''' ''[As Yi lets Adelaide go]'' "Your village will be spared."<br>
''[The bandits bow to Sid. The girls squeal]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' ''[Sensors going off]'' "Warning! Warning! The rift is about to close."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Uh-oh. To the roof!"
----
''[On the roof of the building, the bandits are on one side of a teeter-totter, and a little sad]''<br>
'''Woo:''' ''[Sighs]'' "It's too bad we'll never have that delicious bao again, though."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Oh, just go to Clear Water Village and ask for Ancestor Chang. They have the same bao."<br>
'''Hui:''' "How do you know--"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[--Jumps on the other side of the teeter-totter, sending the bandits back home]'' "Just trust us!"<br>
''[The bandits return to the rift, which immediately fades away. The girls and Breakfast Bot cheer. Breakfast Bot turns on the K-pop and they get dancing.]''
'''Sid:''' "We did it! We did it!"<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "We're awesome! We did it!"<br>
''[Suddenly, Sid gets a call from her <abbr title="father">fÃ¹qÄ«n</abbr>. She answers]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "''Hey, girls. How's the bao coming along?''"<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Remembers]'' "Oh, right."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Horrified]'' "We've got eight hundred to go!"<br>
''[They run off, leaving the phone with Breakfast Bot]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' ''[Still on the line]'' "''Girls? Hello?''"<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' ''[Answers]'' "No one is available to take your call at this time. Please leave a message after the K-pop."<br>
''[Plays the music again]''
----
''[Later, at the festival, Stanley sells his last bao]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' ''[To his exhausted <abbr title="daughters">nÇš'Ã©rmen</abbr>]'' "Thank you for your help today, girls. We sold out, and beat Mike Liu's zongzi stand!" ''[Points to the adjacent stand, where Mike has a sign for fifty percent off and is still stuck with a mountain of zongzi. The sign falls off, Mike groans and eats his zongzi]'' "I know it's a lot of hard work, but I hope your first time making the family bao wasn't too boring."<br>
''[Leaves. The girls look at each other. Nonchalantly]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Oh, don't worry about that."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Definitely not boring."<br>
''[Suddenly the bao book sparks up again, it hits the ground and flips through its own pages. The three bandits poke their heads out]''<br>
'''Yi:''' "Is that zongzi I smell? I'm starving!"<br>
''[Sid gasps, and Adelaide karate chops them back into the book. The book closes and the girls sigh in relief.]''
