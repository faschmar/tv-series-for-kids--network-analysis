''[At the Casagrande mercado, inside the stockroom, Hector, Carlos, CJ and Carl are cleaning up, some doing more cleaning than others. Carl plays around with a soccer ball, does some fancy footwork, and kicks it at a stack of cans]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Goal!"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Carl! I'm not paying you to fool around, I'm paying you to clean up."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Who's fooling around? I'm sorting mystery cans." ''[Picks one up]'' "This one is either canned corn or fake snakes." ''[The can bursts open, expunging green slop and chicken body parts all over Hector]'' "Or neither."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Finding antiques is all the payment I need. Like this toaster from 1950." ''[A piece of bread pops out]'' "And a piece of toast from 1950."<br>
''[Someone else pops out of the toaster]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "And a hairy spider from today."<br>
''[Carlos freaks out. He throws the toaster away. Carl ducks under it, but the spider still lands on his face. Carl freaks out. He crashes offscreen into a box under some shelving. A bottle with a paper inside lands on his head and rolls to Hector's feet]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Look, a message in a bottle."<br>
''[Takes it out]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Is that how you used to text, Abuelo?"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Very funny. But, yes."<br>
''[Hector opens the message, and the four are rather impressed]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "''You found my letter ~ what a pleasure! Keep reading to find my treasure!''" ''[Excited]'' "Oh! Is this for real?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Takes a look]'' "If I'm reading correctly this letter was written by Pancho Villa."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Pancho ''who-a''?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Aye. What are they teaching you in school? He's only one of the most famous generals of the Mexican revolution."<br>
'''Hector:''' "The letter must have belonged to my great-great-grandfather." ''[Takes out an old photo]'' "He rode with Pancho Villa."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Legend has it Pancho Villa buried his gold but no one's ever found it."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Until now. We're gonna be rich!"<br>
'''Carl & CJ:''' ''[Jig together]'' "We're gonna buy so much stuff!"<br>
''[They continue dancing, when Hector shushes them]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "''Callanse''." ''[looks at the message]'' "So how do we find the treasure?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "''Solve this riddle, then solve three more, find the next one lighting up the shore.''"<br>
''[Carlos thinks, when the spider returns and he runs away]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "''Lighting up the shore''?" ''[gasps]'' "That’s the lighthouse!"<br>
'''CJ:''' "To the lighthouse!"<br>
'''Carl & CJ:''' ''[Do the jig again]'' "We’re gonna be rich. We’re gonna be rich."<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Shushes them again]'' "Keep it down. We don't want anyone else finding out about our treasure, there's a lot of cheese muscles around here."<br>
''[They quietly sing together]''<br>
'''Hector & Carl:''' "Keeping it a secret is all for us."<br>
'''Sergio:''' "What’s all for you?"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Uh… All this canned corn."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks, takes the can]'' "Says you. Hello lunch." ''[gets splattered]'' "Oh, now that’s just wrong."
----
''[Later, the four run to the lighthouse. There’s another bottle at the top]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Phew. There’s the next letter."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Go get it, Dad!"<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[To his own padre]'' "Yeah, go get it, Dad."<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Groans]'' "I just ate six corditas, climbing's bad for my digestion."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Oh, did I mention that Pancho Villa's gold is estimated to be worth about three-point-two million dollars, which means split between us it’s…"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Already climbing]'' "You had me at three-point-two million dollars." ''[Hector climbs to the very peak of the lighthouse. He is about to take the bottle, when suddenly a swarm of pigeons divebombs]'' "Aye, chihuahua!"<br>
''[The pigeons keep swarming around Hector, who moves around to avoid them, but is on the verge of falling. Hector’s hijo and niños gasp. The pigeons get their cannons ready, and start firing poop at Hector]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "We gotta help Abuelo!"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Looks around]'' "I can get rid of those birds! Look! An old man throwing bread!"<br>
''[Points to an old man sitting on a bench eating a sandwich, which is made with bread, the pigeons look and go after him. The man has just finished]''<br>
'''Old Man:''' "Ah! Leave me alone! I’m all out of bread!" ''[The pigeons take him away]'' "I'm all out! Please. Please stop!"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Three-point-two million dollars here I come!"<br>
''[Takes the bottle and slides down. He heroically drops in front of the others. Carlos and CJ give him tens, Carl gives him an eight. Hector takes out the note and gives it to Carlos]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Ooh, here’s the next clue. ''At the market, with the old fishmonger.''
''You'll have to prove that no one's stronger''."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Gasps]'' "The next letter must be at the fish market."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Gold, here we come."<br>
'''Vito:''' "Gold? At the fish market?"<br>
'''Hector:''' "I mean... uh… goldfish kids are always begging for a new pet."<br>
'''Vito:''' "Oh, I had a goldfish once, cute little guy." ''[The Casagrandes leave]'' "What was his name? Fred?"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Calls back]'' "Okay, bye, Vito."
----
''[At the fish market, the four are standing in front of the squid tank]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Ooh! There's the next letter."<br>
''[The letter is in the tank, being guarded by the squid]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "But, we'll have to get past that scary looking squid."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "That's actually a giant boxing squid."<br>
''[The squid has the bottle in one tentacle, and a boxing glove on all it’s other tentacles]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[To Carlos]'' "I think he's challenging you."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "What? That's ridiculous-"<br>
''[Suddenly, the squid grabs Carlos and pulls him in. The squid drags Carlos around and starts inking the tank full. Suddenly]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Oh, hey Casagrandes. What’s in the tank?"<br>
'''CJ:''' "Uh, nothing."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Nervously laughs as they escort Maybelle away]'' "Just a lot of water."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Unaware of what’s happening in the tank]'' "I just came here for the free oyster crackers they're usually right here."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Ooh. I think they’re all out of oyster crackers. But, look there’s a great deal on salmon, way, way over there."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Better hurry, I hear they’re running out."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Stakes her fist]'' "Oh, no you don’t. They better not run out of that salmon."<br>
''[Runs over. Meanwhile, Carlos finally comes out of the tank]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Dazed, but holding the bottle]'' "Did anyone see that? It was the match of my life."<br>
''[Comes out]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Great, Dad!"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Reads the message]'' "''No need for a horse or hate today. Just ride the oldest hidden railway''."<br>
'''Carl:''' "That's a subway station for sure, and I know which one's the oldest."
----
''[Later, they arrive at the oldest subway station. Carl looks into a small crevasse between the walls]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hey, there's something back here." ''[Looks and gasps]'' "It's the next letter. This job calls for agent double O’ guapo."<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Thinking Carl means him]'' "Okay, but I don't think I'm gonna fit."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Kind of irritated]'' "Abuelo, that's my code name."<br>
''[Slips into the crevasse and grabs the bottle]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Did you get it?"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Almost, the letter is stuck to a piece of pizza." ''[Carl keeps pulling, and somebody pulls on the pizza. An angry horde of rats wants the pizza. Carl freaks out]'' "Pull me out! Pull me out! Pull me out!" ''[They pull Carl out and the rats take the pizza and leave. Carl has the bottle]'' "Got it."<br>
''[Just then, the train arrives. The driver opens his window to greet his downstairs neighbours]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "Hey Casagrandes." ''[Carl hides the bottle just as Stanley gets out to see them, much to the frustration of the passengers]'' "What brings you to this part of town?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Oh, you know just... uh... taking a tour of the subways architecture. Look at that crown molding."<br>
''[There’s molding on the ceiling, with a bunch of pigeons stuck inside, and a person. Stanley observes the mold when suddenly...]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Uh… Shouldn’t you be driving the train?"<br>
''[The train is taking off without Stanley]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "Dang it, that’s the third time this week."<br>
''[Grabs the handle on the back of the train and flies off. The Casagrandes take out the last clue]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "''The last letter has been found, to claim your treasure you must monkey around''."<br>
'''Carl:''' "The treasure must be with the monkeys at the zoo. Let's go!"<br>
''Carl, Carlos and CJ race off]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Takes out his phone]'' "Rosa’s not gonna believe this." ''[Sends a text]'' "We're going on a fancy vacation, we're rich. Treasure chest emoji. Monkey emoji. On our way to the zoo now."
----
''[It’s nighttime at the zoo]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Which way to the monkeys?"<br>
''[Suddenly, Sergio appears]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Move it, chumps! That gold’s all mine!" ''[Flies off]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Wait, did he say gold?" ''[Gasps. The four start running]'' "He’s going after our treasure!"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "You mean my treasure. Peace."<br>
''[Rolls away on her scooter]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "What!? How does Maybelle know?"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Nevermind, we have to beat her."<br>
''[They keep running. They pull ahead of Maybelle, she goes faster. Hector pushes a churro cart in her direction and she crashes]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[comes out of a pile of churros]'' "Ooh, free churros."<br>
''[The Casagrandes find a sign that reads ‘MONKEYS’ with a big arrow pointing to the right]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "The monkeys are that way."<br>
''[They run in that direction, and somebody turns the arrow around. It was Vito’s dogs. The Casagrandes get where the sign directed them]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "This isn't the monkey cage, these are porta potties."<br>
''[Suddenly, Mr. Chang, riding the zoo tram, bursts out of one. He pulls up next to the Casagrandes]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "Oh yeah, someone switched the sign. Greed brings out the worst in people, huh? Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta get my gold on. Chugga chugga cha-ching! Deuces!"<br>
''[Drives off]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Mr. Chang about the treasure too!?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "We'll never beat him! He has a tram!"<br>
''[Suddenly, Bitsy the elephant comes out of the other porta potty and puts the Casagrandes on her back]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Who needs trams, when you have Bitsy?"<br>
''[Bitsy takes them to the monkey cage. Where Sergio, Mrs. Kernicky, Becca, Par, Mr. Scully, Maybelle, Stanley and Vito are already digging]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "What!? How does everyone know about the gold?"<br>
'''Vito:''' "Hey, thanks for the tip, Hector. When I get the gold there's five bucks in it for you."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Abuelo! you told Vito?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "We should have known you couldn't keep a secret."<br>
'''Hector:''' "I didn't tell anyone except Rosa. I can prove it."<br>
''[Shows them his phone]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Groans]'' "You accidentally texted the whole neighborhood. Abuela is the only person you didn't text."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Oh boy, she's not gonna like that."<br> 
'''Carlos:''' "While we're sitting here bickering, everyone's getting our gold. Dig!<br>
''[Everyone starts digging]''<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Pulls out a mini treasure chest]'' "I found something!"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Snatches it]'' "I’ll take that."<br>
'''Everyone:''' "Get her!"<br>
''[Everyone starts wrestling over it. Suddenly the contents, appearing to be gold bullion, fly out.]<br>
'''Everyone:''' "No!"<br>
[but it's too late, Bitsy sucks it all into her trunk and eats it. Everyone groans]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "I can’t believe Bitsy ate our gold."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "I guess this is what we get for being greedy. We're supposed to be friends."<br>
'''Vito:''' "Yeah. we’s could have just shared it."<br>
'''Hector:''' "That's what I suggested."<br>
'''Carl:''' "You did not."<br>
''[Suddenly Bitsy, who for some reason has chocolate on her trunk and mouth, spits out gold coloured foil]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Hey, wait a minute."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Maybe we can still get some treasure."<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Takes a piece of foil]'' "This isn't gold, it's just chocolate wrappers."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "And the wrappers are coupons." ''[Reads]'' "''Congratulations you found the golden treasure. Here's thirty percent off for your dining pleasure''. ''Sincerely, Pancho Villa's Tacos''."<br>
''[Everyone looks angrily at Hector]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Abuelo! You just let us on a wild goose chase for coupons?!"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Oh yeah, Pancho Villa’s Tacos. Now I remember, Rosa and I had our first date there. Ha. I must have saved that message in a bottle as a souvenir."<br>
''[Everyone is kind of mad at Hector right now]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "Next stop, disappointment. Chugga chugga boo-hoo."<br>
'''Vito:''' "How are you going to make it up to us, Hector? The least you’s could do is buy us all some tacos."<br>
''[Everyone agrees]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "No way, that's too expensive even with thirty percent off." ''[Bitsy grabs Hector]'' "Okay, okay, you can have your tacos." ''[Everyone cheers and goes off. But first Hector returns and grabs the coupons]'' "A discount is a discount."<br>
''[Catches up]''
