''[Leni, Miguel, and Fiona are at the Royal Woods Mall, starving to death.]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Guys, the way Ms. Carmichael had us running around this morning, I did not think we'd survive until lunch."<br>
''[Miguel and Fiona's stomachs growl.]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "No joke, I am beyond starving."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Where should we grab food today?"<br>
'''Miguel:''' ''[gasps]'' "Ooh, what about the new dim sum place?"<br>
''[A long line next to a dim sum place named "Dim Yum!"]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Oh, dream on. The line goes all the way down to the discount flip-flops store, we'd never have enough time. You know how Ms. C gets if we're even a millisecond late."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Ugh."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Well, we better hurry and pick something else to eat."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "OK, um, burger. No! Smoothie. Ugh! So much pressure! Why can't we have both?"
----
''[Later, Fiona sips a smoothie and then chokes.]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Yeah, officially Miguel's worst idea."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Yeah, these bacon cheeseburger smoothies are... ''[chews]'' chewy."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "I'm sorry, I panicked. I didn't want to make us late for Ms. C. She's such a drillster." ''[Leni looks at Miguel confused.]'' "Drill sergeant, just made it up."<br>
'''Leni:''' "That's brill!"<br>
'''Miguel:''' "You're learning."<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Seriously, Ms. C is so nitpicky."<br>
''[Flashback to Fiona folding clothes and putting them on shelves. Ms. C suddenly pops up and scares Fiona.]''<br>
'''Ms. Carmichael:''' "Fiona, this week's Sweater Salute is 'Hip-Hip-Hur-Rayon'. These sweaters are cotton. You need to switch them out and start again. Now, let's hear that salute."<br>
'''Fiona:''' ''[Unenthusiastically]'' "Hip, hip, hur... Rayon."<br>
''[Another flashback to Miguel dressing the mannequins when suddenly Ms. C, who was standing still like the mannequins, greets and scares Miguel so much, he falls over.]''<br>
'''Ms. Carmichael:''' "Nice work, Miguel, but now it's time to change the mannequins into their mid-''morning'' attire, be sure to iron everything first, including the inside pockets, we don't want ''wrinkles'' in our store image, do we?"<br>
''[Next, all three are in the stockroom unloading boxes, when Ms. C pops right out of one, they're so surprised, they all fall over.]''<br>
'''Ms. Carmichael:''' "Chop, chop, I needed those unloaded yesterday, and don't damage the boxes, I wanna reuse them for my sister's move."<br>
''[End flashbacks]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Ms. C sucks all the fun out of retail, don't you agree, Leni?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "I can see both sides, I mean, you guys have legit gripes, but, Ms. C isn't always demanding."<br>
''[Suddenly, they all get texts.]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Ugh, it's her." ''[Mockingly]'' "''Staff meeting as soon as you clock in from lunch''."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "If that woman mentions boxes again, I'll scream."<br>
''[They all get texted again.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Reading her text]'' "And if you see any empty boxes on your way back from the food..."<br>
''[Miguel crushes his smoothie and screams in fury.]''
----
''[The three are back at Reininger's. Ms. C approaches them with a clipboard.]''<br>
'''Ms. Carmichael:''' "So, exciting news: I've been selected to represent our district at this weekend's sock folding conference. While I'm away, one of ''you'' will cover as temporary manager. ''[Gives the clipboard to Leni.]'' Congratulations."<br>
''[Fiona gasps and Miguel laughs excitingly.]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Oh, wow!"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Confused]'' "You want me to read the name of the new manager off your clipboard?" ''[Her friends look a bit annoyed. She realizes and gasps, the two now smile.]'' "Oh, it's me?" ''[Squeals]'' "This is like a dream come true!"<br>
'''Ms. Carmichael:''' "Just keep an eye on the store's calendar of events and my daily checklist and you'll do fine. I'll be leaving tomorrow, so you'll start then." ''[Walks away]''<br>
''[Leni's friends cheer.]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Congratulations, Leni, I know you're gonna be a way better boss than Ms. C."<br>
''[They now hug her, laughing. Leni groans nervously.]''<br>
----
''[Later, Leni is outside of Reininger's looking down and Lori arrives in Vanzilla. Leni gets in the van and the two make their way home.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Hey, Leni. Oh, sorry about the smell, I just dropped off Lynn's softball team, phew, how was work?"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Sighs]'' "Great. Ms. Carmichael made me the temporary manager."<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Surprised]'' "Wow. You don't sound happy about it."<br>
'''Leni:''' "No, I am. It's just Miguel and Fiona think Ms. C is a zero-fun drillster, I don't want them to feel that way about me. I wanna do a good job ''and'' be a good friend. Is that even possible?" ''[Her sunglasses fall down.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Of course it is. Look, as long as you're getting the work done, you can be as fun a boss as you want."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Gasps and adjusts her sunglasses back on her head.]'' "Wow Lori, you know absolutely everything!"<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[chuckles]'' "I literally do." ''[Realizes something]'' "Wait, what's a drillster?"<br>
----
''[The next day at Reininger's, Fiona and Miguel enter the break room.]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "...and I made it clear, I refuse to date anyone wearing cargo shorts."<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Right? it's like; what do they need all those pockets for? What are they hiding?" ''[Notices something]'' "Wait, what is all this?"<br>
''[The two walk over to the table supporting some scones and a latte.]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Ham and scallion scones with lemon herb ch√®vre? My fave breakfast."<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Iced chai latte with organic coconut milk? Did we die and go to retail heaven?"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Enters, happy]'' "Good morning, fashion makers!"<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Leni, did you do all of this?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Just a little something to help my fave frien-ployees to get through the day."<br>
'''Fiona:''' ''[Reads Leni's name tag.]'' "''Store, Funager''. What's a funager?<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Referring to herself.]'' "This gal right here! Like a manager, but fun, I'm gonna make sure work is totes amazing."<br>
'''Miguel:''' ''[Eating his scones]'' "Well, you're off to a great start."<br>
'''Fiona:''' ''[Takes her latte]'' "I'll say." ''[Drinks her latte, and ends up with a foam-stache, which Miguel giggles at. Fiona looks at him, unaware.]'' "What?"<br>
'''Miguel:''' ''[Looks away]'' "Nothing."
----
''[Later, Fiona and Miguel are folding sweaters.]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Okay, two down, only five-hundred more sweaters to go."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Well, at least we don't have the drillster here telling us what-"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Approaches them demandingly]'' "Um, guys, you're doing it wrong. As funager, I think you should be having ''[Excitedly]'' way more fun, with a sweater-folding contest. ''[Encouraging]'' Winner gets this~."<br> 
''[She holds up a plush. Miguel and Fiona gasp in excitement.]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Is that a limited edition Cloris the Loris Sparkle plush?!"<br>
'''Fiona:''' ''[Determined to win]'' "Miguel, You. Are. Going. DOWN!-"<br>
'''Miguel:''' ''[Also determined to win]'' "You're-- on! ''[--He and Fiona start folding sweaters at a super fast pace.]'' I've got nothing to lose!"<br>
''[They both chuckle.]''
----
''[Now, they are doing a fashion show with mannequins.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Welcome to the mannequins fashion show, featuring celeb stylist, Miguel!"<br>
'''Miguel:''' "And here's Tanya, all glammed up for some Royal Woods nightlife. ''[Fiona walks Tanya down the podium as Leni takes pictures.]'' She really dazzles in a fandango-pink romper and kicky vinyl boots."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Holds her phone up.]'' "Runway selfie! Get in here, Tanya!" ''[Takes the selfie.]''<br>
''[Later, Miguel gives a lady a makeover. He smiles and holds up a mirror for the lady to look at her reflection and she is happy with the results. Later again, Leni wraps a gift at the gift wrap station, she looks over and sees that Miguel did a bigger one, then a shadow falls over him, they both look and see Fiona sitting atop a huge gift, she winks at them.]''
----
''[Later, Leni checks her clipboard.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "... ''and'' restock the fanny packs, che-check. Guys, that's everything on Ms. C's list."<br>
''[Miguel and Fiona high-five each other.]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "This morning went by ''so'' fast, I can't believe it's already lunch. Ready to go Leni?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Actually, you go without me. As Funager, I need to stay and hold down the fort."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "''Well'', if you're sure." ''[Nudges Fiona]'' "Let's hurry Fiona, we've only got a half-hour and I will ''not'' relive," ''[trembles]'' "burger shake incident."<br>
''[As her friends head out, Leni signals a hand in front of them and they stop.]'' <br>
'''Leni:''' "No wait, you both worked so hard this morning, and you got everything done. So I insist you take a long lunch, that way, you can try, ''[Happily]'' the new dim sum place!"<br>
'''Fiona:''' ''[Squeals and shakes arms with joy along with Miguel.]'' "Oh my gosh! Leni, you are the best boss in the entire universe!"<br>
'''Miguel:''' "I second that."<br>
'''Cloris the Loris:''' "And I third it."<br>
'''Fiona:''' ''[Envious]'' "We know you won the Loris, Miguel. You don't have to rub it in."<br>
''[The two walk out while Cloris speaks.]''<br>
'''Cloris the Loris:''' "Gosh, somebody's angry."<br>
''[Right when they leave, Leni's phone plays a ringtone. Lori appears on screen.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Hey Len."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Squeals in excitement]'' "OMGosh, Lori! I did what you said. I was a funager! This morning was a blast, we got ''all'' the work done, and Miguel and Fiona are still my friends! You really do know everything."<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Laughs]'' "I literally do." ''[Realizes something]'' "Wait, what's a funager? Leni, Leni-"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Hangs up before Lori can finish.]'' "Bye."
----
''[Later, in the break room, Leni folds some shirts and eats her sandwich, when she hears a horn outside.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Hmm, what is that?" ''[She goes outside to check and sees a bus named "Gigglin' Geezer".]'' "Oh yay, a surprise visit from Pop-Pop and Myrtle." ''[Suddenly, dramatic music plays as more retirement home buses pull up.]'' "What the heck is going on?" ''[Runs inside to check the clipboard, turning the pages.]'' "Saturday, Saturday, Sat-" ''[Finds what she's looking for and gasps in horror.]'' "Oh-no, today is the annual Senior Shop-aganza. How could I forget the busiest day of the year?" ''[Looks at Tanya]'' "Tanya, I was so busy trying to make stuff fun for" ''[Slaps her forehead in guilt]'' "Miguel and Fiona, I forgot to check the calendar. What do I do?" ''[Tanya doesn't do anything. Leni pauses for a few seconds.]'' "I know, but if I ask them to come back early from lunch, I'm a bad friend." ''[Tanya still doesn't do anything, Leni pauses and then sighs.]'' "You're right, you're always right." ''[Takes out her phone]'' "I'll call."<br>
''[Calls her friends.]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Leni."<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Our dumpling dreams are about to come true, all thanks to you!"<br>
'''Miguel:''' ''[In unison]'' "Love you, Leni bear."<br>
'''Fiona:''' ''[In unison]'' "Best funager ever." ''[Out of unison]'' "So what's up?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Uh, never mind, I just wanted to say hi to my fave frien-ployees. Bye!" ''[Hangs up, sighs and looks at Tanya.]'' "Don't give me that look, I'll just have to cover the senior rush." ''[Groans in fear]'' "Alone."<br>
''[Just then, Pop-Pop kicks the door open, and waves at his granddaughter.]''<br>
'''Albert:''' ''[Cheerfully]'' "Hey, Leni-penny."<br>
''[A crowd of the elderly enter the store while clamoring. Scoots wheels up to the register and dumps a pile of gift cards on the counter.]''<br>
'''Scoots:''' "Okay, listen up. I need you to check the balances on ''all'' these gift cards."<br>
'''Leni:''' "I'd be happy to."<br>
'''Scoots:''' ''[Angrily pointing to Leni's eyes.]'' "Kill the pep and get to swiping!"<br>
''[Leni gets started when Pop-Pop and Myrtle approach her.]''<br>
'''Albert:''' "Hey there, Leni."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Hi Pop-Pop, hi Myrtle."<br>
'''Albert:''' "Your Gran-Gran here signed us up for a five K marathon; I don't know how the heck I'm gonna run five thousand miles."<br>
'''Myrtle:''' ''[Laughs]'' "Silly goose, it's five thousand ''meters'', not miles. So Leni, we're gonna need matching active wear."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Got it, let me see what we have in the back."<br>
''[She goes over when an old man manages to get his head stuck in a hat.]''<br>
'''Senior Male Hat Customer:''' "Yah! Help! I'm trapped in this hat."<br>
''[Leni helps the man, the hat goes flying and knocks Tanya's head off.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Aah! Tanya, no! We can fix you!"<br>
''[She starts breathing heavily while holding the mannequin's shoulders when an angry man at the Gift Wrap station yells at her.]''<br>
'''Male Senior Gift Wrap Customer:''' "Missy! Stop playin' with that mannequin! I needed this wrapped" ''[Clenches his fists]'' "''yesterday''!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Coming!"<br>
''[Panting and under stress, she grabs Tanya's head and runs over. She starts wrapping, when Scoots calls her.]''<br>
'''Scoots:''' "Don't forget my gift cards! I was here first!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "On my way!" ''[Leni runs over to the register, forgetting that the wrapping paper is still wrapped around her arm. The paper runs out, and she falls over. The seniors surround her, snapping over one another and giving their demands. Leni looks at each and every one, and lets off a growl of despair, making a run for the break room while holding Tanya's head. She closes the door behind her, sniffles and sits on the doorway.]'' "Tanya you were right, I can't do this alone, I have to tell Miguel and Fiona to come back." ''[Takes out her phone and sighs.]'' "They're gonna think I'm a drillster and probably won't wanna be friends anymore, but Ms. C made me manager, and right now, the store comes first."<br>
''[Leni calls Miguel, he and Fiona are still at the dim sum place.]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Leni, you are talking to ''literal'' ghosts right now, cause we've died and gone to dim sum heaven."<br>
'''Leni:''' "I'm so sorry you guys, but you have to come back to the store."<br>
''[Miguel and Fiona look at each other and laugh.]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Oh Leni, your impression of Ms. C is dead on."<br>
'''Leni:''' "I mean it, we are swamped with seniors, Tanya lost her head, and I need you both back here, right now." ''[Leni hangs up, sighs, and goes back out. Miguel and Fiona arrive and gasp at the state of everything, Leni sees them from behind the counter.]'' "Guys! Miguel, I need you at the cosmetics counter ASAP, we have ten seniors who need you ''phenom'' makeup skills." ''[Miguel nods and goes.]'' "Fiona, I need your creative flair at the gift wrap counter, right now.<br>
''[Fiona nods and goes, and Leni checks her clipboard. Eventually, the shop-aganza ends and the elders leave, happy.]''<br>
'''Albert:''' ''[As he and Myrtle exit with their new tracksuits.]'' "Well I'll be horse-whipped, this is surprisingly airy."<br>
'''Myrtle:''' "Thank you so much, Leni, I'm gonna come here for all my fashion emergencies."<br>
''[They leave, and Scoots pulls up.]''<br>
'''Scoots:''' "The service here isn't ''so'' lousy, and that's high praise comin' from Scoots."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Always appreciated." ''[Scoots rolls off.]'' "Bye, Scoots."<br>
''[Leni goes back inside, and goes to close up when she hears Fiona talking.]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "That was brutal."<br>
''[She and Miguel are exhausted.]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Right? I'm beyond starving. Wanna grab some food?"<br>
'''Fiona:''' "More than I ever have in my life."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Well, thanks for your help tonight guys, I really appreciate it, enjoy your dinner, I'll see you in the morning."<br>
'''Miguel:''' ''[Confused]'' 'Aren't you coming with us?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "You mean, you want me to?"<br>
'''Fiona:''' ''[Also confused]'' "Um, why wouldn't we?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "I just thought you, you wouldn't wanna be my friends anymore."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Girl, what are you talking about?"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Starts tearing up]'' "I was a total drillster like Ms. C and made you come back to help when I was supposed to be the funager."<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Leni, it was the Senior Shop-aganza, of course, you had to ask us to come back."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "This was an awesome day, you were able to balance work ''and'' fun."<br>
'''Fiona:''' "We still think you're the best boss in the universe."<br>
'''Cloris the Loris:''' "And I still think so too."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Hugs them]'' "You guys are the best."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "''So'', food?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "I know just where to go."
----
''[They are all at the dim sum place.]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Ah, now our dumpling dreams really are coming true, because we're all here together."<br>
''[The waiter approaches them.]''<br>
'''Waiter:''' "Are you ready to order?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "I was wondering if we could split the dumpling combo." ''[Gestures to Tanya, who is in the seat next to her.]''<br>
'''Waiter:''' "Absolutely, shouldn't be a prob-" ''[Realizes that Tanya is a store mannequin.]'' "...lem."<br>
''[Tanya's head falls off again.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Sarcastically]'' "Oh, Tanya."<br>
''[The three friends laugh, Tanya looks at the audience and winks.]''
