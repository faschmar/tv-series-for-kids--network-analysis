''[In the park, Ronnie Anne and her amigos are skateboarding]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Doing a skate trick]'' "Whoo-hoo! Yes!" ''[Her amigos follow her]'' "Whoo-hoo! I'm so excited for movie night! Who's turn is it to host anyway?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "I can check."<br>
''[Takes out a paper and reads it]''<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[worried]'' "Oh, don't be me. Don't be me."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Looks like Laird's up."<br>
'''Laird:''' "Phew! ''[Realizes]'' Oh, wait, I'm Laird!"<br>
''[Laird yells and crashes into Bruno's hot dog cart]''<br>
'''Bruno:''' "My cart!"<br>
''[As Bruno says this, he squeezes the mustard bottle he is holding in his hand, and mustard flies out of the bottle. A smoke cloud transitions to Laird with an exhausted expression on his face and a hot dog in his hair, his skateboard helmet off of his head, his body covered in a huge pile of hot dogs, Bruno's crushed hot dog cart behind him. A bunch of pigeons notice Laird, and they attack him while he screams. The pigeons leave Laird lying on the ground, while the rest of the amigos and Bruno run over to him]<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Laird!"<br>
'''Bruno:''' "Are you okay?"<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Gets up]'' "Yeah."<br>
'''Bruno:''' ''[Moves Laird out of the way]'' "Not you." ''[Bruno kneels on the ground as he tears up]'' "I'm talking to my baby! He was only two days away from retirement."<br>
''[Bruno starts bawling like a baby while the amigos exchange looks]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "Um, I don't think I can host tonight. I don't feel so good."<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Bro, you already used that one."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Yeah. You always have an excuse!"<br>
'''Casey:''' "You're not getting out of it this time!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Come on, Laird, it'll be fun!"<br>
'''Sid, Nikki, Sameer, Casey, and Ronnie Anne:''' "Laird! Laird! Laird!"<br>
''[While the amigos walks away, Ronnie Anne starts to walk away but then she stops and stops chanting as well]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Laird, are you okay?"<br>
'''Laird:''' "No. I don't wanna host a movie night because..." ''[puts his hands on his face]'' "I'm embarrassed by where I live." ''[Sighs]'' "It's a money thing."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way, Laird. But money doesn't matter to us."<br>
'''Laird:''' "It matters to me, Ronnie Anne. My house doesn't look like everyone else's."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne's phone starts ringing]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We'll figure this out." ''[She takes her phone out of her pocket]'' "Oh, one sec." ''[She answers her phone and flips it sideways]'' "Hey, Dad. How's vacation?"<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Amazing, Ronita. I'm swimming with dolphins!" ''[Arturo imitates a dolphin and a dolphin comes out of the water and chatters back. The dolphin then goes back into the water]'' "That means... ''Que pasa, delfin.'' Anyway, I'm calling to see if you could please grab my mail when you go to water my plants."<br>
''[The dolphin comes out of the water again]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "You got it."<br>
''[The dolphin sticks its mouth behind the phone, showing the camera its mouth]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "''Gracias'', Ronita. ''[The dolphin steals his phone]'' "Hey, hey, hey! Give that back! It's not waterproof!"<br>
''[The dolphin then goes underwater with the phone, shutting off the phone and the call ending]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "Wait, your dad's on vacation? Maybe we can have movie night at his place and pretend it's my place!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Um, what? I don't know."<br>
'''Laird:''' "Well, it's just a few hours, and I'll make sure no one makes a mess." ''[He kneels down and clings to Ronnie Anne's arm]'' "Please?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I think you kneeled in some relish."<br>
''[Bruno appears]''<br>
'''Bruno:''' "I know relish, and that ain't relish."<br>
''[Laird and Ronnie Anne look down]''<br>
----
''[Later, at Arturo's apartment, Ronnie Anne and Laird enter, Laird carrying a box]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "Thank you so much Ronnie Anne. This is perfect."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne looks at all the Peruvian art and photos of her and Bobby]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hmm... Not yet, we still have to make this place look like it's yours. Did you bring the stuff?"<br>
'''Laird:''' "You bet." ''[Drops the box]'' "Ready to Laird-ify."<br>
''[Realizes that he dropped the box. First they replace the photos of Ronnie Anne and Bobby with photos of Laird. LAIRDIFIED. They swap a Peruvian quilt with an array of bow ties, they've already replaced the other artwork. LAIRDIFIED. Laird continues tossing stuff, which Ronnie Anne catches in a box. Then Ronnie Anne has a pile of stuff thrown on her. LAIRDIFIED. Ronnie Anne and Laird shove everything into the closet. LAIRDIFIED. There's a knock at the door]''<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Nervous]'' "They're here! Are you sure we lairdified enough?"<br>
''[The place is very Lairdified]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I think we're good, just be cool."<br>
''[Laird opens the door and let's Sid, Nikki, Sameer and Casey in]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "Welcome to the Laird lair, where I live. My parents are gone for the night so the place is all ours. Huh. Did I mention I live here?" ''[Nervously laughs]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Bro, this place rocks."<br>
'''Casey:''' "Yeah, you've been holding out on us, give us the grand tour."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Let's start with the bathroom. Cause I gotta go before the movie."<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Not actually knowing where that is]'' "Uh… Uh, sure. Uh… The bathroom is right here."<br>
''[Opens the closet where they hid all of Arturo's stuff]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I think he meant that the bathroom is right there through that door over there."<br>
''[Sameer hurries off. Everyone else looks at the Incan art]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "What are these?"<br>
'''Laird:''' "Oh, that's, uh, hockey gear. Designed to intimidate your opponents."<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Oh, awesome. Let's play."<br>
''[Nikki, Casey and Sid prepare to play hockey with the stuff. Ronnie Anne nervously goes to Laird]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Laird, that's my dad's art from Peru, it's really expensive."<br>
'''Laird:''' "Oh, I got this." ''[Goes to the others]'' "Uh, guys, why don't we go to the kitchen and uh…"<br>
''[Just then, Nikki slaps a sunstone right through Laird's hair. Ronnie Anne catches it]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Nice catch, Ronnie Anne."<br>
'''Laird:''' "Ah, yeah nice catch." ''[His hair splits. Later, they are in the kitchen]'' "So here's the kitchen. Definitely my kitchen."<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Gasps at what she sees on the table]'' "Laird, you have the Juice-o-matic 5000? It blends, purees and even deseeds. Please make me a smoothie."<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Not knowing how to work it]'' "Sure Sid, that's something I know how to use."<br>
''[Laird puts some fruit in the receiver, gulps, and presses the biggest button. The juicer accepts the fruit, but starts going crazy, Laird tries to stop it but can't. Ronnie Anne knows how to turn it off]''<br>
'''Juice-o-Matic 5000:''' "Your juice is ready."<br>
''[The machine spits juice at Laird, sticking him to the wall. Sid takes her smoothie and drinks]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Now that's the good stuff, thanks Laird."<br>
'''Laird:''' "Oh don't mention it."<br>
''[Laird peels off the wall, and Sameer notices something in the fruit bowl]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Hey why is there a big box of chocolates with a note that says… for Ronnie Anne?"<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Uneasy]'' "What!? Oh that's nothing."<br>
'''Nikki:''' ''[Suspicious]'' "Wait a second this can only mean one thing…" ''[Laird and Ronnie Anne look at each other, sweating]'' "Laird has a big, fat crush on Ronnie Anne!"<br>
''[Sameer, Casey and Sid ‘Ooh' at them]''<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Can't think of another excuse]'' "Yes! that's it, you caught me old Romeo here. Obsessed with this beautiful creature." ''[Whispers]'' "I am so so sorry."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Okay let's just start the movie."<br>
'''Casey:''' "Is it a romance?"<br>
''[They all ‘Ooh' again and go to start the movie. Ronnie Anne and Laird sigh]''
----
''[Later, they are all preparing to watch the movie]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "Alright people, you know the rules. No texting during the movie."<br>
''[They all toss Casey their phones. Casey puts them in the drawer next to him. Ronnie Anne arrives with the popcorn]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh wait! that's a drawer that always gets stuck." ''[Remembers]'' "Or so Laird tells me."<br>
''[Casey tries to open the drawer again, but can't]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "Eh, we can deal with it later, it's movie time. Someone snack me." ''[Someone tosses popcorn in Casey's mouth, he eats and blows fire]'' "Ooh, fuego flavour."<br>
''[Looks next to him and sees that he just scorched Nikki's really long bangs. She looks at him dirty and he awkwardly chuckles]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Sit next to Laird, Ronnie Anne."<br>
'''Everyone:''' "''Ooh."''<br>
''[Ronnie Anne is kind of annoyed, but sits next to Laird anyway]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Laird killer movie night now let's watch... Evil Hatman: The Brimming."<br>
''[Goes to start the movie]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "I owe you big time Ronnie Anne."<br>
''[The both pick up the same kernel of popcorn. Laird realizes and abruptly lets go. Meanwhile, outside, Arturo has returned, and is on his phone]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne's Voicemail:''' "Hey this is Ronnie Anne. Beep." ''[Real beep]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Ronita, I had to cut my trip short. Apparently…" ''[Makes dolphin noises]'' "means, ‘attack me'." ''[Hangs up and reaches into his pocket, sighing]'' "All I want to do is relax in my bed." ''[All he finds in his pocket is a tiny fish]'' "Great, I lost my keys in the ocean."<br>
''[Tries to open the door. Meanwhile, the kids are still watching the movie]''<br>
'''Actor in Scary Movie:''' "Hey, who put that hat there?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Don't put it on."<br>
'''Actor in Scary Movie:''' "I think I'll put it on."<br>
''[The actor cries in pain, and the kids comment. Suddenly there's a banging at the door, the kids yelp. Laird clings to Ronnie Anne, and abruptly lets go again]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What was that?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "It was the door."<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Takes the popcorn bowl off his head]'' "But… but, who could it be at this hour?"<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Someone should go check it out."<br>
'''Casey:''' ''[Assumes a manly position]'' "You're right." ''[Ushers Nikki forward]'' "Thank you for volunteering, Nikki."<br>
''[Nikki gives Casey a dirty look, and keeps giving it to him as she goes to the door. She looks through the peephole. Between Arturo's torn hat, and the lightning outside, what Nikki sees looks like the character on the dvd case she's shakily holding]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' ''[Scared]'' "It's Hatman!"<br>
''[The other have joined her]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "Should we call for help?"<br>
'''Laird:''' "Oh, uh, let's not be too hasty. Could be a mistake."<br>
''[Nikki takes another look, there's nobody there]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "He's gone."<br>
'''Laird:''' "What did I tell you? Now let's get back to movie night."<br>
''[Sameer, hears something]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "He's coming through the window."<br>
''[Two arms open the window]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Not if I can help it!" ''[Grabs a cactus]'' "Fly cactus!" ''[Throws the cactus out the window, it takes the character down]'' "Quick! We gotta lock that window."<br>
'''Nikki:''' "I got this. If something happens to me Sid gets my skateboard."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Yes!"<br>
''[Casey and Sameer are disappointed]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Oh man."<br>
''[Nikki closes the window. Meanwhile, Arturo gets up and takes the cactus off his face,'' ''ripping his facial hair off. Nikki is relieved, but from inside, Arturo still looks like Hatman, Nikki sees him, yells, and runs. Outside, Arturo is freaked out too]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Gasps]'' "Burglars! Must be after my Juice-o-matic 5000." ''[Calls the cops]'' "Hello? Police? A band of thieves are trying to steal my juicer!" ''[The police answer]'' "Of course that's an emergency." ''[They hang up on Arturo]'' "Hello? Hello?" ''[Groans]''<br>
''[Back inside, the kids are ducked behind the table]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "That's it! I'm getting our phones and calling for help. If something happens to me Sid gets my skateboard."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Yes!"<br>
'''Sameer & Casey:''' "What does she need two skateboards for?"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne goes to the drawer, but it's still stuck closed]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "Are you jiggling it right?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "You see me jiggling."<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Ask Laird, it's his house."<br>
'''Laird:''' "I mean, a jiggles a jiggle."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne goes back to her friends]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Okay, we can't get our phones, but everyone stay calm. All the windows and doors are closed, right?"<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Realizes something]'' "Well, I may have cracked open the bathroom window." ''[Everyone groans]'' "I was being considerate."<br>
''[They hear noises in the bathroom]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "This is bad! This is so bad!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Pull yourself together, Laird!"<br>
''[Splashes her smoothie in Laird's face]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "Ronnie Anne, what should we do?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hmm, guys we need to defend my dad- I mean Laird's home."<br>
''[In the bathroom, Arturo climbs through the window, still arguing with the cops]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "No no no, you don't understand officer. It's the Juice-o-matic 5000. You know why they call it that? That's how much it cost." ''[Gets hung up on again]'' "Hello?"<br>
''[Falls into the tub, the shower curtain falling on him. He groans. Arturo exits the bathroom, the curtain and dim lights obscuring his identity from the kids, and covering his eyes]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Hey Hatman! Eat romantic chocolates!"<br>
''[Sid loads the chocolates into the juicer and Sameer blasts Arturo. Arturo wipes the chocolate off his face]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Eat pineapple, Hatman!"<br>
''[Casey holds a pineapple on the floor and Nikki slapshots it with a Peruvian spear. It hits Arturo in the face and he lands on the bed]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Spiky!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne comes out from behind the couch and closes the bed on Arturo]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Booyah! Nobody breaks into Laird's house and gets away with it."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We got you now Hatman no more sequels for you."<br> ''[Ronnie Anne opens the bed, and they gasp realizing who they just beat up]'' "Dad?"<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Gets up]'' "Ronita?"<br>
'''Casey, Sameer, Nikki & Sid:''' "Ronnie Anne's dad?"<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Nervous]'' "Oh boy."<br>
'''Arturo:''' "What are you all doing in my apartment?" ''[Sees the new decor]'' "Is this my apartment? Oh, that dolphin must have hit me hard."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I'm so sorry, Dad; this is all my fault."<br>
'''Laird:''' "No, it's my fault. This is his place. I wanted you all to think it was mine; Ronnie Anne was just helping me."<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Why'd you do it, Laird?"<br>
'''Casey:''' "More importantly, does this mean you're not in love with Ronnie Anne?"<br>
''[Laird rolls his eyes at this]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "I was just worried you'd see my house and treat me differently."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Aw, Laird, it doesn't matter where you live."<br>
'''Nikki:''' "We'll always be your friends, bro."<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Touched]'' "Thanks guys. I'm sorry Ronnie Anne's Dad, I hope I didn't bruise your pineapple."<br>
'''Arturo:''' "I'm just glad my juicer is safe. You can still have movie night here if you want."<br>
'''Laird:''' "No Ronnie Anne's Dad. We can have it at my house. My real house, I'm tired of living a lie. And you can come too Ronnie Anne's Dad."<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Only if you stop calling me that."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Movie night is saved!"<br>
'''All kids:''' "Laird! Laird! Laird!"
----
''[Later, they are outside Laird's house]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Laird, you were embarrassed because you live here?"<br>
''[They are standing in front of a large mansion]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "Not anymore. Who wants snacks? We have free vending machines in every room."<br>
''[Everyone enters, amazed]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Amazed]'' "Can I pretend this is my house?"
