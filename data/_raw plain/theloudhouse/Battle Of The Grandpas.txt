''[Inside an alleyway a band of thieves have an old woman surrounded]''<br>
'''Burglar #1:''' "Alright, old lady, hand over the walker."<br>
''[Suddenly, the woman lets out a yell and hits the guys with her purse, then another with hard candy, grabs a man's ear with her dentures, and hits the fourth on the head with her walker. She takes her mask off]''<br>
'''Phoebe Powers:''' "You guys should always respect your elders."<br>
''[Inside the Casagrande's apartment, the kids are watching the show]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Woah!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I knew it was Phoebe Powers in disguise. Hurry, Abuelo. You're missing it."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Oh, and don't forget the snacks."<br>
''[Hector enters with a plate stacked with tortas]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Ooh, did I miss her 'facey' thing? That's my favorite part." ''[Lalo sees the tortas]'' "No, Lalo!"<br>
''[Suddenly the TV goes blank]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Groans]'' "The TV's on the fritz again."<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Still playing keep-away with Lalo]'' "Lalo, these aren't for you."<br>
''[Lalo walks around Hector, he spins and the tortas go flying right into his nieto's mouths, except Carl, who catches it on his face. Another one lands on the TV]''<br>
'''Boy:''' "You saved the day, Phoebe Powers."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "And so did you, Abuelo."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "You fixed the TV."<br>
''[The kids thank their Abuelo. Suddenly they hear a motorcycle engine]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Wait, is that who I think it is?"<br>
''[The kids run to the window]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "He didn't tell us he was coming."<br>
''[A motorcycle rolls up, a hand with the name 'FRIDA' tattooed on its fingers revs the engine, and the man riding smiles]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[She and Bobby being born on Maria's side of the family]'' "Who is that guy?"<br>
'''Carlota, CJ & Carl:''' "Grandpa Danny!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "He's the coolest."<br>
'''Carlota:''' "You're gonna love him, Ronnie Anne. He's a movie stuntman."<br>
''[The kids race outside. Hector sees who it is]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Not pleased]'' "Oh, no, not that bobo again."<br>
''[The kids come outside as Danny takes his helmet off]''<br>
'''Danny:''' "Grandpa Dan is here. I brought presents!"<br>
''[Revs his bike, and cash comes flying out of the exhaust pipes. Frida's niños cheer]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "My favourite kind of present. I'll never grow out of it."<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Watching from the window]'' "I give them allowance sometimes."<br>
''[Frida comes out of the building, holding Carlitos]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Papá!"<br>
''[Puts Carlitos on CJ and hugs her padre]''<br>
'''Danny:''' "Mi amorcito, I saw these fancy tissues and I thought of you."<br>
''[Holds up a gold-coloured tissue box. Frida takes one and taps it on the tear in her eye]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "They feel like silky pillows and smell like cotton candy." ''[Laughs]''<br>
''[Danny shrugs and hugs his nietos]''<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[In unison]'' "Hi, Grandpa Danny."<br>
'''Carl:''' "You're really here."<br>
'''Danny:''' "You can't be mis nietos. You're all so tall. And Carlota, you're more stylish than the celebrities I work with."<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Grandpa, stop!" ''[Chuckles]'' "But which celebrities, exactly?"<br>
'''Danny:''' ''[Goes over to his hija's sobrinos]'' "You must be Bobby and Ronnie Anne. You can call me Grandpa, too. Or... Number one grandpa." ''[Shows the back of his jean jacket, which has #1 GRANDPA written on the back]'' "Now bring it in."<br>
''[They and their primos hug their abuelo]''<br>
'''Bobby & Ronnie Anne:''' "Number one grandpa! Number one grandpa! Number one grandpa!"<br>
''[Hector growls]''
----
''[In the mercado, Hector is still growling]''<br>
'''Vito:''' "Heya, Hector."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Que grandpa? I'm Bobby and Ronnie Anne's grandpa, not him. That bobo's always showing up to steal the spotlight."<br>
'''Vito:''' "That's the famous Grandpa Danny? I don't get it. Take away his cash, his looks, and his bike, what do you have left?"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Flies in to answer]'' "Hector." ''[Laughs, until Hector throws a pan dulce at him]'' "Ow! The truth hurts."<br>
'''Vito:''' "You're just as cool as that guy." ''[Sees something]'' "Woah! Is he doing handstand push-ups?"<br>
''[Danny is in fact doing handstand push-ups on the sidewalk, his nietos and hija cheering him on]''<br>
'''Frida, Ronnie Anne, Bobby, Carl & Carlota:''' "Go, go, go, go, go…"<br>
''[Hector growls]''<br>
'''Vito:''' "Oh, forget about it. You can eat a bowl of cereal right off your stomach with no hands. Can Mr. Washboard Abs do that?"<br>
'''Hector:''' "You're right, Vito. I may not be a motorcycle stunt guy, but I've done a few cool things in my day."<br>
''[Holds up an old photo of himself dressed as a cowboy with a bull]''<br>
'''Vito:''' "Woah, you won a Halloween contest?"<br>
'''Hector:''' "I was a bull rider! Never mind. The point is, I'm gonna show those kids that ''I'm'' the coolest grandpa around."
----
''[Later in the living room, Hector enters with a dolly of snacks]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Hey, kids, look what your awesome abuelo brought you! You're favourite snacks." ''[Smells something and is intrigued. He goes to the kitchen and sees the kids eating crepes, that Danny is cooking]'' "What?"<br>
''[Danny flips his pan, jumps off the wall, and catches the crepe. The kids are impressed]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Check it out, Abuelo. Grandpa Danny learnt how to make these crepes on his last movie set."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "It was Phoebe Powers' new movie, 'The Crepes of Wrath'."<br>
'''Danny:''' "Want a crepe, Hector?"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Unamused and annoyed]'' "I can make my own, creep." ''[Takes the pan]'' "Excuse me. I meant 'crepe'." ''[Tries to flip the crepe, but accidentally throws the whole pan into the air. The pan hits him on the head. The kids laugh]''
----
''[Back in the mercado, Hector is thinking]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "There's got to be another way for me to beat Danny at being cool."<br>
'''Vito:''' "Hey, how's about your music? I bet Danny can't shred like you."<br>
'''Hector:''' "You're right, Vito. I ''am'' the only talented musician around here."<br>
''[Takes out his guitar, takes a breath, and strums, bringing tears to Vito's eyes]''<br>
'''Vito:''' "That was beautiful. But if you wanna beat someone as flashy as Danny, you're gonna need more current material."<br>
''[Hector thinks, and gets an idea]''
----
''[In the living room, a radio is turned on. Hector starts rapping for his nietos]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Yo, yo, yo. I bet you kids didn't know your abuelo knew how to rap."<br>
'''Danny:''' ''[Approaches]'' "Did somebody say rap? Did I mention I sang backup rap vocals on Phoebe Powers' new single?" ''[Takes out a mic and whistles]'' "Sergio, drop a beat!" ''[Sergio starts beatboxing and Danny starts rapping]'' "''I roll down the road from set to set. With all my homies like P. Powers on her private jet. Stunt master flying through the air on my moto. If you really wanna see me then you probably need a telephoto.''" ''[To Hector]'' "''And while you try to be sly, and you write your reply. And you try to be fly as this guy. Let me give you a little piece of advice, keep trying.''"<br>
''[The kids and Sergio know that Hector has just been called out]''<br>
'''Kids:''' "Rap battle! Rap battle! Rap battle! Rap battle!"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Uh…" ''[Gets rapping]'' "''Listen up. Hector here, rapping from my sofa. My rap is so clean, it's like a loofah''."<br>
''[The kids aren't feeling it]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Ooh!"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "What's a loofah?"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Whatever it is, it doesn't rhyme with sofa."<br>
'''Danny:''' "''Está bien, Hector? Cause I been rappin' for a minute, bro. Sigueme, niños, let me get you some fro-yo''." ''[Drops the mic, and the kids cheer. The kids go to the door]'' "Hector, join us."<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Disdainfully]'' "Only because I can't say no to fro-yo."
----
''[At the GLART station, everyone is waiting for the train]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Grandpa Danny, can I get two scoops?"<br>
'''Danny:''' "Two scoops of every flavour."<br>
''[The kids cheer and Hector growls. A train arrives, but it's express. Hector is the only one who notices this]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Quick, everyone, better catch the train." ''[Danny runs onboard. Nonchalantly]'' "Oh, is that the express? We need the local. Oopsie."<br>
''[The door closes on Danny and he gets taken away]''<br>
'''Danny:''' ''[Knowing this was done on purpose]'' "Hec-torrrrr!"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Oh, no, poor Grandpa Danny. Wave goodbye." ''[Walks off]'' "Now let's go get our fro-yo."<br>
''[The kids cheer and they head off]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Can I still have every flavour?"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Chuckles]'' "No."
----
''[Back at the mercado, Hector is innocently sweeping the floor, when Danny angrily walks in]''<br>
'''Danny:''' "Hector, I just spent three hours on a subway train because of you! What was that about?"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Don't act innocent with me. I know you're trying to steal the kid's attention by acting all cool."<br>
'''Danny:''' "What?! Oh, ''now'' I get it. You've been trying to compete with me this whole time? That's ridiculous." ''[Laughs, and gets in Hector's face]'' "You could never win, old man."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Old man? You're older than I am!"<br>
'''Danny:''' ''[Points at Hector's dome]'' "Not according to your hairline."<br>
'''Vito:''' ''[Enters the mercado]'' "Hey, Hector."<br>
'''Danny:''' "Can an old man do this?"<br>
''[Grabs Vito and his dogs. He lifts Vito with one hand, and each dog with either side of his moustache]''<br>
'''Vito:''' ''[A little uncomfortable]'' "If I toss my cookies it's on you. Literally."<br>
''[Danny quickly puts the trio down and Vito runs out]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Big whoop." ''[Sees Lalo]'' "Check this out."<br>
''[Picks up Lalo, carries him below the waistline to Danny, and holds Lalo over his head, only for Lalo to drop in him. Danny laughs]''<br>
'''Danny:''' "Fine. if it's a competition you want, then may the coolest grandpa win." ''[Picks up Lalo with ease]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Gets up, breathlessly]'' "You're… going… down."
----
''[Round one of Hector vs. Danny. Round one is a chilli pepper eating contest, the kids are watching, both abuelos eat three peppers each. Hector can handle it fine, but Danny's face turns red, his moustache burns off, and he screams, smoke coming out of his ears. The kids cheer as he runs around. Hector wins. Next, they are fishing. Hector gets a nibble and pulls up an average-sized redfish. He is satisfied until he sees Danny is gone. Danny emerges from the river lifting a redfish bigger than he is. The kids cheer. Danny wins. Next, Danny is drinking a prune soda, as is Hector. They stare each other down, and Danny feels the rumbles and runs to the bathroom. Hector laughs, but then runs after him. Next, they are arm wrestling with their moustaches. Danny wins, and tauntingly rips Hector's moustache right off. Hector screams]''<br>
'''Danny:''' "Let's settle this once and for all."
----
''[Up on the roof, Hector has replaced his moustache, and Danny is on his bike]''<br>
'''Danny:''' "Don't try this at home. Now count me down."<br>
'''Kids:''' ''[As Danny revs his bike]'' "Tres, dos, uno, blast off!<br>
''[Danny drives up a ramp off the roof of the building, he glides through the sunlight and lands on the roof across the street]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Amazed]'' "Wow!"<br>
'''CJ:''' "What he said."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "I applaud you, Grandpa!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "He's cooler than Phoebe Powers."<br>
'''Vito:''' "Unbelievable! Sorry, Hector. Can't compete with that."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Oh yes I can."
----
''[Later, the kids are counting down again]''<br>
'''Kids:''' "Tres, dos, uno. Blast off!"<br>
''[In the park, Hector is riding a toro once again. And doing a very good job of it]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hey, Abuelo's pretty good."<br>
''[The kids cheer]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Go, Abuelo."<br>
''[Suddenly, Hector's belt breaks off and the buckle hits the back of the bull's head. The bull is very upset by this. The bull throws Hector off and he crashes into the fence. And because he doesn't have his belt, his pants fall down, revealing a rather poor choice of clothing]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Wrong day to wear red chonies, Abuelo!"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[This not being his first rodeo]'' "Uh-oh."<br>
''[The bull snorts and rampages at Hector]''
----
''[The rodeo ends with Hector laying on the couch his entire lower body bandaged with an icepack]''<br>
'''Danny:''' "I'm sorry you got hurt, Hector. You shouldn't have tried to compete with me. You've just gotta accept it, old man."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Yeah, yeah. You're the cool grandpa."<br>
''[Carl, Ronnie Anne and CJ run up to Hector]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "What's for breakfast, Abuelo?"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Not in the mood]'' "You'll have to ask your ''other'' grandpa."<br>
'''Danny:''' "Hey, kids, vamanos."<br>
''[They go to the kitchen. Hector stays on the couch and groans. In the kitchen, Danny starts feeling out of his element]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[On Danny's shoulder]'' "I want cereal."<br>
'''CJ:''' "I want pancakes."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Can I get a smoothie?<br>
''[They dissipate and Carlota arrives with a hamper]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "You're on laundry duty today, Grandpa Danny."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Holding Carlitos]'' "Carlitos wants ''you'' to change him."<br>
''[Danny falls over]''<br>
'''Danny:''' "These kids are…" ''[Suddenly, an engine revs up]'' "Is that my bike?"<br>
''[Danny runs past Hector and looks out the window. He sees Sergio and Lalo joyriding on his motorcycle]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Ooh!" ''[Sqwuaks]'' "Look out."<br>
''[They crash into the trashcans]''<br>
'''Danny:''' "Oh-no!"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "Grandpa!"<br>
''[All the kids start shouting at Danny at once. Danny goes to Hector]''<br>
'''Danny:''' "I don't know how to do this. It's easy to be cool for a few days, but the stuff you do every day is way harder." ''[Thinks, and rips the title off the back of his jacket. He sits with Hector]'' "Hector, I'm sorry. I didn't realize how hard it is to be an everyday grandpa. I think this belongs to you."<br>
''[Gives Hector the '#1 GRANDPA' patch]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Thank you, Danny. I appreciate you saying that. Friends?"<br>
'''Danny:''' "Friends!"<br>
''[They fistbump, now being 'GRAND-PALS!']''
----
''[Danny's bike now has a flashy sidecar, and someone has the entire family's names in his hand. Hector smiles, as does Danny. The kids, Frida and Vito watch Hector in the sidecar of Danny's bike]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Woah! We have ''two'' awesome abuelos."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Let's take this for a spin!"<br>
'''Danny:''' "Abuelo locos forever!"<br>
''[They ride into the sunset. Both wearing a '#1 GRANDPA' patch, Hector's bearing an 'OG' patch on the top. They ride, and suddenly the bull knocks them off into oblivion]''
