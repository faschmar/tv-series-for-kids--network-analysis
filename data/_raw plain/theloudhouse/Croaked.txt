''[Lalo is sleeping in the apartment hallway until Carlitos wakes him up in skeleton makeup.]''<br />
'''Carlitos:''' "Ahh! Bl-bl-bl!"<br />
''[Lalo licks Carlitos's makeup off him. Lalo's tongue is covered with the skeleton makeup. Carlitos puts Lalo's tongue on him. Only some of the makeup is left on Carlitos' face as he runs off laughing. Carlitos walks away. Lalo follows him. The camera zooms out to show Bobby and Hector hanging traditional Spanish banners up.]''<br />
'''Bobby:''' "Abuelo, you got the ladder, right?"<br />
'''Hector:''' "Hang on, Bobby, I'm updating my status." ''[Hector types on his phone. He reads along as he types.]'' "Decorating for ''Dia de los Muertos''. Skull emoji, smiley face..." ''[Bobby almost falls.]'' "...''cacahuates'', ''chimichangas'', ''y'' balloons."<br />
''[Carl grabs two handfuls of marigolds and throws them into the air.]''<br />
'''Rosa:''' "Carl, don't just ''throw'' the marigolds, you're supposed to make a path, so our ancestors can find their way here."<br />
'''Carl:''' "Our ancestors don't have GPS?"<br />
''[Rosa takes off her shoe, and almost throws it at Carl; Carl flinches, grabs the basket and backs away, making a path and sheepishly laughing. Sid and Ronnie Anne walk up to Rosa.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "Wow, what's all this?"<br />
'''Rosa:''' "It's for our Día de los Muertos celebration."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Day of the Dead."<br />
'''Sid:''' "Oh, is that like Mexican Halloween?"<br />
'''Rosa:''' "No Mija, it has nothing to do with Halloween; it's the day that we honor our loved ones who have passed away."<br />
'''Sid:''' ''[Seeing a bowling ball on Rosa's shrine.]'' "By bowling."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Slaps her friend's back, laughing.]'' "Sid, no." ''[But doesn't actually know.]'' "Right? We don't bowl. Do we?"<br />
'''Rosa:''' "No, I see your mother hasn't taught you enough about your traditions." ''[Explains the shrine]'' "This is an ofrenda, where we place pictures of our loved ones." ''[Takes out a picture]'' "This is your great grandfather Lázaro, mi papá," ''[places the picture on the shrine, her eye shedding a tear.]'' he loved sweet tamales and bowling, between you and me, he was much better at eating tamales than at bowling." ''[They all laugh.]'' "I put these things on the ofrenda, so we can enjoy them, while he visits us, on this special day. I miss my papá a lot, but this holiday always makes me feel close to him."<br />
'''Sid:''' "Mrs. Casagrande, is Day of the Dead for pets too? My sister Adelaide lost her pet Froggy a few weeks ago and she's really sad, maybe this could make her feel better."<br />
'''Rosa:''' "Of course, that's a great idea, but there's a lot more to know about Día de los Muertos," ''[Turns to get more stuff.]'' "why don't we sit down and-"<br />
''[The girls have already left.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Thanks, Abuela!"
----
''[Meanwhile, Carl is just outside the building, making a marigold path.]''<br />
'''Carl:''' "How far is the land of the dead anyway?"
----
''[Ronnie Anne and Sid are at the Chang's apartment, where Adelaide is on her tablet, Sid stops Ronnie Anne before they engage.]''<br />
'''Documentary Narrator:''' "It's Frog Week on the National Frogographic Channel, like it is every week."<br />
''[Adelaide starts to cry.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "See, she's a mess, she can't stop thinking about Froggy."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Puts her hand on Sid's back.]'' "Hey Adelaide, you know what today is? The Day of the Dead."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Still sad]'' "Day of the what?"<br />
'''Sid:''' "Day of the Dead; it's a special holiday where Froggy can come visit you."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "Really? How?"<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "First we have to build an altar and put all the stuff Froggy likes on it. What was he into?"<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "Oh, so many things." ''[Takes out a ziplock bag.]'' "His favorite food, bacon bits." ''[Tosses them to Ronnie Anne, and holds up a DVD.]'' "This was his favorite movie, ''The Hoppit''." ''[Tosses it to Sid, and takes out a shoelace.]'' "Shoelace jumprope, it kept him in shape for catching flies."<br />
''[Later, the three are outside the building, wearing surgical masks, and giving each other a thumbs up.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Calls up]'' "Okay! Sergio!"<br />
'''Sergio:''' ''[Flies around above them, with a diaper. Squawks.]'' "Special delivery, fresh from Carlitos."<br />
''[The diaper lands between the three, and a swarm of flies gathers round; the girls catch them all in jars and run back inside, except for one fly who gets away with the diaper. Later in the park.]''<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Supervising Ronnie Anne and Sid getting a lily pad.]'' "And the lily pad with the ''big'' flower."<br />
''[Sid is holding Ronnie Anne, while she reaches for the lily pad, but looses her grip, and Ronnie Anne falls into the lake, ending up with the lily pad on her head, she spits out the water.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''Seeing the lily pad on her head]'' "Got it."<br />
''[The girls race off, not noticing that Carl is behind them still spreading marigolds.]''
----
''[Back at the Chang's apartment, Adelaide's shrine to Froggy is complete.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What do you think, Adelaide?"<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "I think Froggy will love it." ''[Sid and Ronnie Anne give each other a thumbs up, when suddenly Adelaide pulls up a chair.]'' "You guys can go now, I'm just going to sit here and wait for him to come back."<br />
''[Sid and Ronnie Anne realize that they didn't think this through.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Tries to explain]'' "Uh Adelaide, a tiny misunderstanding, Froggy doesn't actually come back," ''[Adelaide is shocked to hear this.]'' "he just..."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "What do you mean?! You told me he was going to come visit, I though we we're gonna jump rope, and watch a movie, and eat bacon bits."<br />
'''Sid:''' "Well, we didn't mean ''visit'' we meant." ''[Realizes, and whispers to Ronnie Anne.]'' "What did we mean?"<br />
''[Ronnie Anne has no idea.]''<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Starts crying again]'' "Now I miss Froggy even more!" ''[Runs off]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "Whoops."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Chi-''huahua'', what do we do now?"<br />
''[They think, and Sid gets an idea.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "I once had a goldfish that died, and my mom just replaced it and acted like it was the same fish."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh yeah, that still works on Bobby."<br />
'''Sid:''' "To the pet store."<br />
''[The girls head off.]''
----
''[Later, at Pete's Pets.]''<br />
'''Pete:''' "''Well'', I don't usually rent frogs but, I'll make an exception, I am such a big fan of your mom," ''[gestures to a poster of Becca at the zoo, standing in an alligator's mouth.]'' "her gator tour is the best thing at the zoo."<br />
''[Pete gives Sid a frog and Sid squeals.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "Thanks, Pete." ''[The girls look at the frog, and take him to Adelaide's shrine.]'' "Now, remember, if anyone asks, your name is Froggy."<br />
''[The frog croaks.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Adelaide! Someone's here to see you!"<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[In her room]'' "I don't wanna see anyone."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Not even Froggy?"<br />
''[Adelaide comes over and gasps when she sees the frog.]''<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "Froggy!" ''[hugs the frog]'' "You're back! I have a whole list of things for us to do, come on, let's hit the park."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Careful not to get him dirty."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "Why?"<br />
'''Sid:''' "Cause we won't get our deposit back." ''[Ronnie Anne elbows her.]'' "From, uh, the afterlife."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Suspicious, but only at first.]'' "Okay."<br />
''[Later, Adelaide and Froggy are on the roof, sunbathing, they drink their juice boxes. A fly flies above, and Froggy snares it with his tongue while they're in the park, Adelaide is crouched down, sees a fly near her, and catches it in her mouth, then remembers that she's not a frog and spits it out, Froggy eats it. The two play leapfrog, and later, they watch a movie. Later, as Adelaide is napping, Sid takes the frog.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "Okay Froggy, time to go back."<br />
''[The girls sneak away, not knowing that they're leaving a trail of bacon bits.]''
----
''[The girls return to the building.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "I'm just gonna go ahead and say it, that was a pretty great plan."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I'm just gonna go ahead and agree."<br />
''[The girls do a handshake, and go inside. They enter the Chang's apartment, and see Adelaide.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "Hey Adelaide, what's going on?"<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Putting more photos on the shrine.]'' "I guess Froggy had to leave, but since that worked so well, I thought I'd bring back Great Aunt Millie, Old Mr. Woodford, and Abraham Lincoln." ''[Gasps]'' "I forgot Lincoln's top hat." ''[Gleefully runs off]'' "I love this holiday."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh-no! What did we do?"<br />
'''Sid: '''"This is bad, we can't rent a Great Aunt Millie, or an Abraham Lincoln, and I have no idea who Old Mr. Woodford is."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "But if we can't produce these people, Adelaide will ''know'' that Froggy didn't really come back, she'll be crushed."<br />
'''Sid:''' "Well then we have to bring them back too."<br />
''[Ronnie Anne thinks about that. Later, she goes to her Tío, who's ironing laundry.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Tío Carlos, would you mind help me and Sid with our school play?"<br />
'''Carlos:''' "Wha- sure, what's it about?"<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "It involves Abraham Lincoln."<br />
'''Carlos:''' "Oh, fore score, and say no more."<br />
''[Ronnie Anne leaves, and Carlos realizes that he left the iron on. Next, Sid is disguising herself as her Great Aunt.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Huh, looks great, just one more detail." ''[Puts some sunglasses on her.]'' "Tada." ''[Turns her back to Sid.]'' "Okay, now hop on."<br />
''[Sid gets on Ronnie Anne's back, they struggle a little with balancing, but they manage to button up the overcoat and hold still.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "This is bad timing, but I have to go to the bathroom."<br />
''[Ronnie Anne growls. Meanwhile, Adelaide is finishing the shrine, when 'Abraham Lincoln' comes to visit her.]''<br />
'''Carlos:''' ''[Clears his throat]'' "Greetings audience members."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Gasps]'' "Wow, Abraham Lincoln, it worked. ''[Lightly gasps, picks up a hotdog, and goes to Abraham Lincoln.]'' "I didn't know what you liked to eat, so I got you a hotdog."<br />
'''Carlos:''' ''[Takes it]'' "Ooh, I've never had one of these before, but I'll give Mary Todd the recipe."<br />
'''Sid:''' ''[Offscreen, playing Great Aunt Millie.]'' "Hey there dearie," ''[Struggles to keep balance.]'' "It's me, Great Aunt Millie."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "Aunt Millie!" ''[Hugs her, almost throwing Sid off balance.]'' "You feel, lumpy."<br />
'''Sid:''' "Thank you sweetie, I've been getting ripped in the afterlife."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Gasps]'' "I've got your favorite perfume."<br />
''[Sprays it in Sid and Carlos's faces, Carlos sneezes.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "Well that was a great visit," ''[Carlos keeps sneezing.]'' "but I'd better get back to the gym, they don't call me Aunt, ''Treadmillie'' for nothing."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "Bye Aunt Millie!" ''[Carlos keeps sneezing.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' ''[Offscreen with Ronnie Anne.]'' "Hurry get up there."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I'm trying."<br />
'''Sid:''' "You're facing the wrong way."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Sorry." ''[Carlos sneezes himself off screen, and the girls come out, Ronnie Anne on top this time, wearing a trench coat, hat and moustache.]'' "Sid, I'm still backwards." ''[To Adelaide]'' "Adelaide, it's me," ''[Sid turns herself around.]'' "your old pal Mr. Woodford." ''[Awkwardly laughs]'' "missed ya, when I wasn't alive." ''[Keeps laughing, but Sid loses her balance and they stumble offscreen, and accidentally knocks the sneezing Lincoln's beard off. Ronnie Anne tries to laugh this off, and bend down to pick it up.]'' "Sid, I can't reach it."<br />
''[Sid tries to get the beard, but pulls up Abraham Lincoln's trouser leg instead, he falls over, accidentally pulling the girls' costume off.]''<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Gasps]'' "Sid? Ronnie Anne? That's not Abraham Lincoln, and Mr. Woodford was a poodle."<br />
'''Sid:''' ''[Slaps her forehead]'' "Right, now I remember."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Tears building up]'' "So that means Froggy was a fake too? I hate Day of the Dead!" ''[Runs into her room, crying]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Wait! Adelaide! We can explain!"<br />
'''Carlos:''' "Strange play," ''[Eats the hotdog]'' "Good hotdog."<br />
''[The girls run to Adelaide's room, where she's locked herself in.]''<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "Leave me alone, liars!"<br />
'''Sid:''' "We made it worse, what do we do now?"<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What we should have done in the first place; go to the expert."
----
''[The girls go downstairs, where Rosa is still at her shrine.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Abuela, we need to talk to you."<br />
'''Sid:''' "We really messed up."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We gave Adelaide the wrong impression about Día de los Muertos, she thought Froggy was really going to come back."<br />
'''Sid:''' "And Aunt Millie, and Abraham Lincoln, and Mr. Woodford."<br />
'''Rosa:''' "Mr. Woodford?"<br />
'''Ronnie Anne & Sid:''' "He's a poodle."<br />
'''Rosa:''' ''[Disappointed]'' "Aye, ''muchachas''."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Takes Rosa's arm]'' "She locked herself in her room, can you help us?"<br />
''[All three go upstairs. Rosa knock on Adelaide's door.]''<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "Go away Sid!"<br />
'''Rosa:''' "It's not Sid sweetie, I heard you are a little sad."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Sniffles]'' "Froggy never came back."<br />
'''Rosa:''' "Oh, but he did."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Comes out, tears still in her eyes.]'' "He did?"<br />
'''Rosa:''' ''[Hugs Adelaide]'' "Come down and see our altar Mija, and I can explain what Día le los Muertos is really all about." ''[They all go downstairs, and Rosa shows Adelaide her shrine.]'' "Adelita, this is mi papá, just like you miss Froggy, I miss," ''[kisses her hand and touches the photo.]'' "mi papá, very much."<br />
'''Sid:''' "He liked bowling and tamales."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "But he was better at eating Tamales."<br />
'''Rosa:''' ''[To the girls]'' "Get your own material." ''[To Adelaide]'' "I honor my papá, by putting out all the things he loved, and I use incense candles and marigolds, to help guide his spirit back."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Looks around]'' "So, where is he?"<br />
'''Rosa:''' "Well, he's in my heart, you see, on this day, we think about our loved ones, and ''that'' keeps their memories alive, so even if we don't see them, they're still with us."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Hugs her picture of Froggy, and gasps.]'' "I do feel like Froggy is here."<br />
''[Adelaide puts her photo on Rosa's shrine, and a frog lands on Rosa's head.]''<br />
'''Rosa:''' ''[Screams]'' "Señor Froggy? It's a Día de los Muertos miracle."<br />
'''Pete:''' ''[Comes in the apartment, sweating.]'' "There you are. Little stinker followed the trail of bacon bits all the way back here. Whew, you guys keep talkin'." ''[sits down]'' "I'm good."<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[To Rosa]'' "Abuela, this isn't Froggy, it's fake Froggy."<br />
''[Rosa sighs with relief, and fake Froggy jumps into Adelaide's hands, they hug each other, and Sid gets an idea.]''<br />
'''Sid:''' "Pete, how about we make a trade? Tickets to my mom's gator tour in exchange for the frog?"<br />
'''Pete:''' ''[Thinks about it]'' "Put me in the ''splash zone'', and we have a deal."<br />
'''Sid:''' ''[Shaking hands with Pete]'' "Deal."<br />
'''Adelaide:''' "Yay!"<br />
''[Everyone laughs]''
----
''[Later, the shrine is built to both Lazaro and Froggy, and both families are in the apartment celebrating together. Carlitos and Lalo have churros, and Ronnie Anne goes to her Abuela, and gives her a drink.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Thanks for saving the day, Abuela." ''[Hugs her]''<br />
'''Rosa:''' "You're welcome, I'm glad I could teach you about our family's traditions."<br />
'''Frida:''' ''[Offscreen]'' "Okay," ''[Setting up her camera]'' "Everybody get together for a photo." ''[Starts the timer, and joins everyone, Carlitos is waving in the direction of the space between Rosa and Maria.]'' "Look at the camera Carlitos."<br />
''[Carlitos keeps waving to what the printed photo reveals to be the spirits of Lazaro and Froggy. The episode fades out, when suddenly Ronnie Anne realizes something.]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Wait, where's Carl?"<br />
''[At the moment, Carl has finished with the marigolds.]''<br />
'''Carl:''' "Phew, finally, the last of the marigolds." ''[spreads them, and stretches his back.]'' "Our ancestors will have no trouble finding our home." ''[Looks around]'' "Now where am I?"<br />
''[The scene pans out, revealing he's walked all the way to the original show.]''<br />
