===Act I===
''[Night at Fairway University. Lori is about to hit the ball in the hole]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "The Petoskey Open comes down to this. In the first tournament of her college career, Lori Loud has a chance to win it all for Fairway U." ''[She swings the ball, and it sails past 100y and 200y before hitting 300y.]'' "And the crowd goes wild! Woo-hoo-hoo!" ''[She performs a victory dance and laughs.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[on the phone, calling from the mercado.]'' "Great shot, Babe. I think? It's kind of dark. Maybe you should call it a night."<br>
'''Lori:''' "I can't, I need to keep practicing. I'm the only freshman on the team and if I don't do well, I could lose my scholarship."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Sorry I'm not there to give you a big hug."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Aww. Thanks, Boo-Boo Bear."<br>
'''Vito:''' ''[there's a long line at the mercado.]'' "Hey! Youse two love birds finished? I've been waiting for 15 minutes. My spumoni's melting!"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Aw, Sorry, Babe. I gotta go. Don't worry. You're gonna do great."<br>
''[Lori waves good bye, hangs up, and sighs. She hears the wind whistling, and when she looks down, she notices there's already a golf ball at the tee.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Huh? That's weird." ''[to a nearby gopher]'' "Did you do this?" ''[the gopher shakes its head]'' "Hello? Anyone here?" ''[she begins to put her club back, but another begins to levitate, much to her shock. She falls to the ground, opens her eyes, and notices it's back to normal.]'' "Huh? Maybe I've been practicing a little too much."<br>
''[The gopher glares at Lori before returning to its hole.]''
----
''[The library. Lori is carrying a stack of books and talking to the librarian.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "OK. And these are all the books you have on putting greens. I need to know every blade of grass on that tournament course. I'm under a ton of pressure."<br>
'''Librarian:''' "Shhh! I'm a librarian, not a counsellor."<br>
''[She puts a book on Lori's stack, which proves to be too much for her. Lori collapses, and the other students shush her. Later, Lori places her books down at a desk, but one of them begins to levitate and opens, scattering dust all over Lori.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "What. Is. Happening?!" ''[runs to librarian]'' "Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!" ''[The librarian glares.]'' "Oh, I know, I know, I know. Shh." ''[returns to the desk, only to find a gigantic pile of books on there. She panics as another books levitates itself on top of the pile, and the stack falls on Lori. She emerges from the pile to find the glaring librarian.]'' "It wasn't me!" ''[the final book lands on Lori]'' "Ow."
----
''[Lori is now at a bar]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "It's just nerves. A little iced tea and a little lemonade, and I will be fine. Hello? Anyone here? I just wanted to get an Arnold Palmer." ''[A drink pushes itself towards her. She's once again horrified as the drink collapses, and she comes face to face with a janitor.]'' "I'm sorry!" ''[she runs out of the room and the janitor is just confused.]''
----
''[Inside her dorm room, Lori is shining a flashlight all over. She checks underneath the bed, and then looks in her fridge before locking it up.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "No ghost is jumping out of my mini-fridge." ''[she opens a cabinet where her golf clubs are. When she hears a sound, she proceeds to beat up the source with a golf club. Her dorm mates can hear her racket all the way outside.]''<br>
'''Female Dorm Mate:''' "Lori? Everything okay in here?"<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[she's revealed to have destroyed her alarm clock]'' "There was a mosquito on it." ''[nervously laughs]''<br>
'''Female Dorm Mate:''' ''[nervously laughs]'' "OK." ''[closes the door]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[rushes to the mirror]'' "You're losing it, Loud. You need help. Think! Who're you gonna call?"
----
''[The McBride house. Clyde is watching ''ARGGH!'' on TV.]''<br>
'''Hunter:''' "ARGGH! This is one tricky ghost. If I'm going to catch it, I'll need my officially-licensed Hunter Spector phantasmal glasses," ''[Clyde equips said item]'' "my trusty spirit translator," ''[Clyde equips his spirit translator and gives a thumbs-up]'' "and of course, my ghost phaser." ''[gasps]'' "Look out! A ghost!"<br>
''[He shoots a "ghost", which is obviously a sweater with a face painted on it on a coat hanger. Clyde begins to follow suit, but his phone rings. He accidentally shoots a hole in the roof, and a few pieces of debris land on his head.]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "This is Clyde."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Clyde, it's Lori. I have a big-time problem on my hands, and I need your help."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Lori, I think you have the wrong number. This is Clyde... McBride."<br>
'''Lori:''' "I know. And also, I know you're the brains of the Clincoln McCloud operation, which is why I called you and not Lincoln."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Um, Lori," ''[it's revealed he's also watching ''ARGGH!'' at the McBride house]'' "you're on speaker."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Oh. Sorry. I guess you can help, too. Listen, I think there's a ghost on campus that's haunting me, and I need your ghost-hunting expertise to get rid of it."<br>
'''Clyde:''' ''[Excitedly jumps off the couch with Lincoln]'' "A ghost?! We've been waiting our whole lives for this call!"<br>
'''Lori:''' "I can't tell anyone here because I don't want them to think I'm losing it. Which is why I'm gonna need you guys to be discrete."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Confidently]'' "Don't worry. Discrete is what we're all about."<br>
''[He and Clyde high-five. Lincoln accidentally fires his phaser and blows a hole in the roof before they set off.]''
----
''[The next day, Vanzilla pulls up at Par Hall. Lincoln and Clyde exit]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Let's go get that ghost!" ''[They put sunglasses on and high-five]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Wait. Let me try one. That ghost is gonna be toast." ''[they shout and high-five in mid-air]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Lincoln, you left one of your blasty toys!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[blushes in embarrassment as a few girls giggle]'' "Be cool, Dad. It's called a ghost phaser."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[Notices Lori; happily]'' "Hey, there's my girl!" ''[hugs Lori, spinning Lincoln on an axis.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Hey, Dad. OK, Dad. Time to go."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[puts Lori down, tears up]'' "OK. OK, bye, kids! Have fun! Lori, there's a lasagna in Lincoln's toy bag."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Groans]'' "Dad, it's not-"<br>
'''Lori:''' "You guys are literally saving my life. I'm so freaked out that I'm starting to lose my hair." ''[starts shedding hair. Some of it lands on Lincoln's face.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Heh, I noticed."<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Worried]'' "We need to get rid of this ghost quickly and quietly so I can focus on the tournament."<br>
''[The siblings are distracted when they hear Clyde's ghost detector beeping. Clyde is using it on Raj.]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Clear. No spectral activity over here."<br>
''[Lori panics and shuts the door on Lincoln, sending him spiraling away. She rushes to Clyde]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "My new caddy." ''[laughs nervously, then rushes off with Clyde]''
----
''[At night, the Louds and Clyde arrive at the golf course.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "So, this is the first place that I saw the ghost."<br>
''[Lincoln puts on his special lens as he walks further towards the source. He notices something glowing in the distance.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Gasps and whispers]'' "Clyde, I found something over here!" ''[The others follow him to the source. Clyde gasps and puts his special glasses on. Lincoln puts a hand into a slimy substance and plays around with it before sniffing it.]'' "Blegh! It's even grosser than I thought! Awesome!"<br>
'''Lori:''' "What is it?"<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Ectoplasmic residue!" ''[Lori blinks in confusion; deadpan]'' "Ghost goop."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "I'll take some for further study." ''[tries to put the goop inside his bottle, but accidentally flings it out of his hand. Coach Niblick is driving by in his golf cart, but the ghost goop lands in his eyes. He loses control of his cart as it spins and crashes into a lake.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "We need to go."<br>''[The trio leave. Coach Niblick emerges from the lake, and his golf cart is sent out of the lake onto the gopher.]''
----
''[The bar.]''<br>
'''Male Golf Student:''' "So he blows the putt for bogey, and then I'm all like, 'Scrap the blade and use the rest...'"<br>
'''Lincoln and Clyde:''' ''[burst into the library, striking fancy poses with their phasers]'' "Clear!"<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Walks in]'' "Would you put those away? There are people in here. ''[They walk to behind a counter]'' This is the spot where the ghost Arnold Palmered me."<br>
''[Lincoln traces the floor and investigates.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "All I'm getting is floor wax and-" ''[sniffs; flinches in disgust]'' "Eugh! Somebody stepped in something!"<br>
'''Clyde:''' "The special evidence has obviously been mopped away. We'll have to recreate the splash patterns to see what type of ghost we're dealing with."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[gets behind the bar, holding two glasses]'' "Hmm. Did it splash you like this?" ''[splashes Lori's hair with a glass]'' "Or more like this?" ''[splashes Lori on the face with the other glass.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Neither! It didn't throw the drink ''at'' me!"<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Oh. So maybe more like this?" ''[splashes the drink past Lori and onto the janitor; embarrassed]'' "Oops. Sorry."<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Forced laugh]'' "We were just leaving."<br>
''[The three leave in a hurry. The Arnold Palmer residue vanishes before the janitor looks at the floor.]''<br>
'''Janitor:''' "Huh?"  
----
''[The library.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Guys, remember, this is a library, so I need you to be extra quiet."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Whispers]'' "Got it."<br>
''[He and Clyde bust open the door and start striking poses before running in.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Whispers]'' "Guys, what did I just say?!"<br>
'''Librarian:''' "Shhh!"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Hi again." ''[returns to the desk she was attacked by books]'' "This is where the ghost started hurling books at me." ''[One of the books starts levitating]'' "Yeah, just like that."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "I'll save you, Lori!"<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Panics]'' "No!"<br>
''[Lori ducks as Clyde fires his phaser at the book, but misses.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Angrily]'' "Don't shoot me, Clyde, shoot the ghost!"<br>
''[The books all start glowing red and attack the group. In the midst of the chaos, Clyde notices a red orb.]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "There it is!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[the red orb starts floating]'' "I've got you now, ghost. Ready, aim..." ''[He and Clyde start firing, and the orb reverts to sky-blue before fleeing]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[as Lincoln and Clyde start firing]'' "Gah! It's in non-fiction! Now it's in biographies!" ''[Lincoln takes aim, Clyde bumps into Lincoln, and Lori trips over them]'' "It's headed to the romance section! No wait... it's coming back!"<br>
''[The ghost spirals around the three, disorienting them]''<br>
'''Lincoln and Clyde:''' ''[Looking at each other in unison; happily while high fiving]'' "That was awesome!"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Oh, it's getting away! Follow it!" ''[The ghost heads to the emergency exit. As Lincoln and Clyde follow suit, they trigger the alarm system, dousing Lori in water. She turns around to face the librarian, who shows an angry look; Gently]'' "Uh, so sorry." ''[offers a cloth]'' "Uh, maybe this will help? Uh, gotta go!"
----
''[The ghost, with Lincoln, Clyde, and Lori in pursuit, goes into the woods]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Seriously?! It had to go into the dark and creepy woods?!"<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Here, Lori! This spirit-protection cloak will keep you safe!"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Um, this is just an ARGGH! hoodie. Oh, well, it's worth a shot."<br>
''[As she dons the ARGGH! hoodie, the three find the orb levitating close to them, making noises.]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "I-I think it's trying to communicate with us!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "I'll use a spirit translator!"<br>
''[He presses a button, but all he gets is...]''<br>
'''Hunter Spector:''' "Don't forget to watch ''ARGGH!''cast."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "That can't be right."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Less talking, more blasting."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Ready..."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Aim..."<br>
''[The phasers run out of power.]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Our batteries must have died!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Angrily to the ghost]'' "That's it! Listen up, ghost! You need to leave my sister alone. You're really scaring her, it's super messed up, ''and'' you should feel awful about yourself!"<br>
''[The ghost shimmers]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "It's working! The ghost responds to shame and guilt, just like me!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Chanting]'' "Leave Lori Loud alone!"<br>
'''Clyde:''' ''[Chanting]'' "Leave Lori Loud alone!"<br>
'''Lincoln and Clyde:''' ''[Chanting]'' "Leave Lori Loud alone! Leave Lori Loud alone!"<br>
''[The ghost bursts into a bright light and fades away. Lori gasps.]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "We did it!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "We drove the ghost away!"<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[hugs the boys]'' "Thank you! I knew you could do it, Clyde! Lincoln, I had my doubts, but you really pulled through."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Thank you, I think...?"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Finally, I can focus on getting ready for the tournament." ''[munches on a cookie]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Hey, where did you get that cookie?"<br>
'''Lori:''' "It was in the pocket."<br>
'''Clyde:''' ''[feels his pockets]'' "''That's'' where I put that!"
----
''[The next morning, Lori pulls up on the range in a golf cart and gets out and whistles. A ball whizzes past her, and she ducks.]''<br>
'''Raj:''' "Sorry about that, Lori. Everyone's game is a bit off today."<br>
''[He reveals that everyone is struggling. Coach Niblick blows his whistle but is hit in the chest by a golf ball.]''<Br>
'''Coach Niblick:''' "Good heavens! I don't know what's going on with you people, but the Petoskey Open is tomorrow, and we positively stink!"<br>
'''Raj:''' "It's Shanks, Coach. He hasn't been around all day and it's really messing with our game."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Um, who's Shanks?"<br>
''[The other students laugh nervously.]''<br>
'''Raj:''' "Um, come with me, Lori." ''[heads over to a sand hazard]'' "Have a seat. Usually, we wait until after the first tournament to tell freshmen about this. Shanks Bogey is Fairway's golf whisperer. He's like a good-luck charm, an advisor, caddy, and friend all in one." ''[Flashback to the National Championship of 1900]'' "The year was 1900. Fairway U was in the National Championship and losing badly. That is, until their caddy Shanks rallied them. He carried six golf bags at a time that day. He knew exactly which club to use on every hole. He would do anything for the team. He was such a fixture at the school that they offered him a full-time gig as caddy after graduation, and he's been helping the golf team at Fairway ever since..." ''[Back to the present.]'' "...even in the afterlife."<br>
'''Lori:''' "So wait, you're saying Shanks is a..."<br>
'''Raj:''' "That's right. He's a ghost." ''[Lori gasps]'' "I know. It sounds crazy, huh?"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Not exactly."<br>
'''Raj:''' "He didn't come to practice today and that's very unlike him. We really depend on Shanks, Lori. I'm afraid that if he doesn't show up, we might never win again."<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Despairing]'' "Oh no. What have I done?!" ''[She whimpers as she pulls her face down.]''<br>
''[End of Act I]''
----

===Act II===
''[At the Loud House, Lincoln is playing a video game when his phone rings.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Hmm?" ''[picks up]'' "Go for Linc."<br>
''[On the other end is Lori, wearing the ARGGH! hoodie with the hood over her head.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Lincoln, I need you and Clyde to come back to Fairway. And can you get Mom to drive you? Dad kind of made a scene last time."<br>
''[Lincoln glances to his left; Lynn Sr. has been listening while carrying a Fairway flag and a photo of Lori.]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[heartbroken]'' "You're on speakerphone..." ''[walks away]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Angrily]'' "Yeah, why does everyone keep doing that?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "What's the crisis, Lori?"<br>
'''Lori:''' "You know that ghost you guys drove away? I need him back. Apparently he's, like, the team's good luck charm."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Well, we'd love to help, but we're in the ghost-''busting'' biz, not the ghost-''friending'' biz."<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Panicking]'' "Lincoln, without him, my team is gonna lose the Petoskey Open and every other tournament we play. My golf career will be over, which means I lose my scholarship, not to mention my hair is still falling out!" ''[removes her hood, revealing she's nearly going bald. Lincoln reacts in disgust.]'' "I think my teeth are next. One of my molars feels loose!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Lori, you're spiraling!"<br>
'''Lori:''' "I know. I literally need help!"<br>
'''Mortician's Club:''' "Light as a feather, stiff as a Boris." ''[Lincoln looks over and sees Lucy and the morticians using Boris for a ritual]'' "Light as a feather, stiff as a Boris."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Hmm. I might know a few people who could bring back your ghost."<br>
''[Lucy and the morticians suddenly appear in front of him, much to his shock]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Did you say ghost?"<br>
''[Boris collapses.]''<br>
'''Boris:''' "Oof."
----
''[Back at Fairway, Lori is waiting when a black hearse arrives. A bouncer opens the trunk of the car, and coffins exit from it, much to Lori's surprise. Raj is also confused.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Uhhh, huh... Newer caddies." ''[Laughs]''<br>
''[Raj exits. The coffins open, startling Lori; one doesn't open, and proceeds to roll off in front of Lori's view. Lucy and the other morticians pop their heads up. from their coffins.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Good morrow, sister."<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[hushed tone]'' "Can we, like, hurry this up and get inside?"<br>
''[Persephone taps on Lucy's shoulder and points to the distance.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Gasp! We lost Boris!"<br>
''[The coffin containing Boris rolls away towards the practice field; Boris eventually manages to get his coffin open.]''<br>
'''Boris:''' "Mmm... this does ''not'' look good for Boris..."<br>
''[His coffin slams against the wall, sending him out of his coffin; he bounces on a wall of wire, bouncing off it and gracefully landing in the palms of two cheerleaders.]''<br>
'''Cheerleader 1:''' "OMG, that was, like, so awesome!"<br>
'''Boris:''' "Many apologies for interrupting your human stacking ritual. Boris will leave now."<br>
'''Cheerleader 2:''' "Don't go, we need a new flyer."<br>
'''Cheerleader 1:''' "Wow! You have, like, totally amazing balance."<br>
'''Boris:''' ''[flattered]'' "Oh, thank you. It must be my hollow bones."
----
''[Nightfall. Lori and the remaining morticians are gathered in a circle on the putting greens]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Holding a book]'' “I think I found your ghost. I was able to dig up this old Fairway yearbook from 1900.”<br>
''[Blows the dust off it, which Lori coughs from. Lucy gives Lori the yearbook, she looks through it and gasps]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Points at one photo]'' “Shanks Bogey, that's him!”<br>
''[Lori looks through more photos of Shanks]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' “Armed with this most intimate info, it's time we made contact with Shanks, and let him know he's dearly missed at Fairway.” ''[Lucy places the book in a stump in the centre and everyone joins hands]'' “'tis a time to putt, a time to play through. Dear spirit of Shanks, we summon thee back to Fairway U.”<br>
'''Mortician's Club:''' “Tis a time to putt, a time to play through. Dear spirit of Shanks…”<br>
'''Everyone:''' ''[Including Lori]'' “..we summon thee back to Fairway U.”<br>
''[A wind blows the candles out, and a sound is made from the bottom of the lake]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Noticing, gasps]'' "Look! Is that Shanks?"<br>
''[Lori trembles, while the morticians look, the sound in the lake gets closer, the morticians are anticipating. But it's just a frog, everyone's rather disappointed.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Sigh."
----
''[Later, an oven dings as Lori takes a rather foul-smelling food out of it]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[coughs]'' "This smells worse than Lynn's feet."<br>
'''Lucy:''' "That's the fermented bean meal. Dr. Flickenlooper's dyspeptic bread was a dietary staple at the turn of the century when Shanks was alive."<br>
'''Haiku:''' "It's a peace offering. Shanks listed it as a favorite food. That, and pigs in a blanket."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Um, why didn't we just make those?"
----
''[Lucy sets up a bell tied to the food at the library]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "When Shanks comes for the bread, this will alert us to his presence. Now we wait."<br>
'''Morpheus:''' "Hey, where's Boris?"<br>
''[Cut to Boris at a cheerleader rehearsal, having the time of his life. Cut back to the library.]''<br>
'''Persephone:''' "I'm sure he's just resting in his coffin." ''[The bell rings]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "The bell has tolled. Our peace offering worked."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Our bread!"<br>
''[It's revealed that other golf students have found the bread instead]''<br>
'''Raj:''' "Wow. You made this, Lori? It's really good." ''[Dante is seen sneaking a piece of the bread]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Dante?!"<br>
'''Dante:''' "Yeah. It's delicious." ''[his stomach rumbles]'' "I'm afraid a dark storm is brewing in my belly." ''[farts]''<br>
'''Raj:''' ''[the other students start farting]'' "Lori, what did you do to us?!" ''[runs away]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "It's not your fault, Lori. It's the bean meal."
----
''[At the theater]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[handing Lori a top hat, she and the other morticians are wearing similar hats]'' "According to the yearbook, Shanks was part of a campus theater group called the Yips. I even had Dante learn his favorite song." ''[hands Lori a cane]'' "Now grab your cane, Lori. If we party like it's 1900, Shanks will surely show up."<br>
''[Dante begins to play Shanks's favorite song as the Morticians start dancing. Lori follows their moves, but while she struggles at first, she begins to get the hang of it.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "This is actually kinda fun!" ''[the lights turn off]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "This is a good sign. Keep dancing! It must be working!" ''[the light glows blue]'' "He has arrived." ''[the light descends, gasping some of the morticians]'' "Speak to us, Shanks!" ''[it's revealed to be a disco ball]'' "Hiss!"<br>
''[Boris and the cheerleaders enter the room. A few of them grab Haiku and push her between them]''<br>
'''Morpheus:''' "Oh no! This must be some normie sacrifice ritual!"<br>
''[The cheerleaders throw Dante onto the disco ball. He latches on to it and spins around as he's still farting from the bean meal. Boris somersaults onto the top of the cheerleaders' tower.]''<br>
'''Boris:''' "Boris got spirit. How about you?"<br>
'''Haiku:''' "Clearly we've summoned the wrong kind of spirit."<br>
'''Boris:''' "Ready, break!" ''[he and the cheerleaders disperse their formation and leave]''<br>
'''Persephone:''' "What was that?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Is everyone okay?"<br>
''[Dante falls down with the disco ball and gives out one last fart, sending him flying off the ball.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Well, this is a bust. What's next?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Sadly, sister," ''[Takes her hat off]'' "this was my last idea."<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Sighs; miserably]'' "That's it. Shanks isn't gonna show up tomorrow. I'm gonna have to tell everyone what I did and they're gonna kick me off the team."<br>
''[The disco ball begins glowing. Lori alerts her eyes while Lucy takes a closer look and feels around it.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Wait. Look at the ball. Do you see that?"<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[looks at the ball]'' "Huh, that's literally the same glow I saw from the ghost!"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Of course! Fractured mirrors are the best way to see into the spirit world."<br>
'''Persephone:''' "So where in the spirit world is Shanks?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "The spirits are showing me a cemetery with a strange affinity towards... golf?"<br>
'''Lori:''' "That looks like the old cemetery near campus!"<br>
'''Haiku:''' "This school is so creepy. I want to go here."<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Now that we know where he is, we can convince him to come back."<br>
''[The morticians leave. Lori looks at the ball, but suddenly realizes everybody else has left.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Wait!" ''[To herself]'' "Maybe I should go alone."<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Turning to her after overhearing her.]'' "What? You're terrified of ghosts."<br>
'''Lori:''' "I know, but I'm the one who drove Shanks away. I must have really offended him, and I have to make things right. So I'm just gonna face my fears and go into the" ''[Becoming more scared]'' "dark, cold, spooky, desolate, cemetery."<br>
''[Lori leaves.]''<br>
'''Mortician's Club:''' "Lucky."
----
''[The Eternal Greens Cemetery.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "It's fine. It's fine. It's all gonna be fine. Nothing scary here-" ''[is spooked by a gopher]'' "Oh. Hey, little buddy. Have you seen any spirits around here?" ''[The gopher blinks. Lori repeats that action.]'' "Okay." ''[The gopher sinks into the ground. Lori soon finds and approaches Shanks's headstone]'' “Hello? Mr. Bogey? Can I call you Shanks?” ''[Nervously laughs]'' “I'm not quite sure of the proper way to greet a ghost. I just came here to tell you, I'm sorry. I had no idea how important you were to Fairway. And I never should have scared you off. So I guess this is me asking you to… please come back.” ''[No answer. Lori sighs]'' “Well, that didn't work.” ''[Lori notices a ball on a tee nearby, it glows blue. Lori gets an idea]'' “But as long as I'm here, might as well play a hole.” ''[Takes a club off of Shanks' stone]'' “Huh, this pitching wedge oughta do it. Right, Shanks?” ''[Lightning goes off]'' “Oh, am I using the wrong club? Would you suggest I try something else?” ''[Shanks gives her a different club]'' “A nine-iron, huh?” ''[Lori takes it and goes to the ball. She hits it, and Shanks takes it to the hole]'' “Whoa, good call on the nine-iron.” ''[Later, Lori sets up another shot]'' “Yeah, I literally have no idea how to play this one.” ''[The tree near the hole starts glowing]'' “Play it off the tree? If you say so.” ''[Lori takes the shot and it goes in the hole]'' “Yes! Nice caddying, Shanks.” ''[Lori goes to get the ball when the inside of the hole becomes a vortex of the universe. The ball pops right out]'' “Okay, that was terrifying. But I still got a hole in one!” ''[Chuckles]'' ''[More lightning]'' “So, does that mean you're coming back to Fairway?” ''[No answer. Lori gets up, sad]'' “Look, Shanks, the thing is, the Petoskey Open is tomorrow and the team really needs you. If you don't wanna come back for me, at least come back for them. Please?” ''[All Lori gets is a wind blowing through a crooked branch]'' “Okay then, sorry I bothered you.” ''[Lori puts her hood on and goes back to Fairway as the wind continues]''

''[The next day is the Petoskey Open. Lincoln, Clyde, Rita, Lynn Sr., Lily, and the Mortician's club are here to support Lori, who's wearing a wig]''<br>
'''Announcer:''' ''[Whispering]'' “It all comes down to this. Everything rests on the shoulders of Lori Loud. Can a freshman with zero tournament experience win it for Fairway?” ''[Lori nervously laughs, gulps, and takes her shot, her wig spinning on her head. The ball lands right in the sand trap]'' “Ooh, I just jinxed her, didn't I?”<br>
----
''[Lori climbs down into the sand trap and gets her shot ready]''<br>
'''Lori:''' “Come on, Loud. You can do this.” ''[Lori tries to look up, but all she can see is the sun]'' “Gah, how am I supposed to make the shot with the sun in my eyes?”<br>
''[Just then, Lori's umbrella glows and opens by itself. She's pleased and takes the shot and sinks it. The crowd clap and cheer.]''<br>
'''Announcer:''' "She did it! It's a miracle shot! Fairway wins the Petoskey! Lori Loud will be allowed to show her face around campus without shame!"<br>
''[Lori cheers for herself]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Looks back into the sandpit]'' “Huh?” ''[Shanks assumes human form and smiles at Lori. Lori gasps at first, but sighs]'' “Thank you, Shanks.”<br>
''[Shanks winks at Lori and goes off. Lori climbs out of the sand and her team goes to congratulate her. The other Louds and Clyde cheer and the Mortician's Club just watch Boris on top of the pyramid]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Yeah!"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "That's my daughter!"<br>
'''Boris:''' “I've got spirit! Yes, it's true! Let's give it up for Fairway U!” ''[Boris's head cranks 360 degrees and grins.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Sigh. I don't think Boris is coming home with us."
