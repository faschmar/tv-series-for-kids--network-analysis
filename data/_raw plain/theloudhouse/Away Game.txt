''[At the Casagrande apartment, the Santiago kids have their bags ready]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "First sleepover at Dad's. Whoot whoot!"<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Digs into his bag]'' "I can't wait to check out his new place!" ''[Takes out a cactus wearing sunglasses]'' "I got him this singing cactus as a housewarming gift."<br>
'''Singing Cactus:''' "''Congrats on Your Casa! Congrats on Your Casa! Congrats on Your Casa! Congrats on Your Casa!''"<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Joins in]'' "''Congrats on Your Casa! Congrats on Your Casa!''"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne joins in as they head out]''<br>
'''All three:''' "''Congrats on Your Casa! Congrats on Your Casa!''"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne closes the door, Rosa is behind it]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[To her hija, concerned]'' "I still don't understand why the kids have to go to Arturo's for the weekend."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Pops up behind Rosa]'' "Yeah! I can't sleep alone! I'm afraid of the Cucuy."<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Closes her book]'' "Stop worrying, you two. It's normal for the kids to spend some weekends with their dad."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "But their beds are here. This is their home. Can't they just go to the movies?"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Or get mani-pedis?"<br>
'''Maria:''' "The kids are going to be fine. Calma, Mama." ''[Walks off]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Aghast]'' "Calma? Arturo hasn't spent any time with the kids in two years! He has no idea how to take care of them!" ''[Later in the kitchen, Rosa is making soup]'' "What if he forgets to feed them?" ''[ Imagines Bobby and Ronnie Anne as skeletons waiting to eat. Meanwhile, the kids are making pizza with their padre, Bobby tosses the dough, spins around, and catches it on one finger which impresses his hermana and padre]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Muy Bien, Bobby!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yeah!"<br>
''[The two clap for Bobby. Back at the Casagrande kitchen, Rosa grabs Sergio and starts plucking out his feathers without realizing]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Screams]'' "Wrong ingredient!"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mis bebés are gonna starve!"<br>
''[She puts Sergio in by accident, he comes out]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Angry]'' "Better than eating parrot!"<br>
''[Rosa chuckles nervously. Later, Rosa is unclogging a toilet]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Those poor kids are probably so bored! He has no toys, no stickers, no chores, nothing fun!"<br>
''[She imagine Bobby and Ronnie Anne growing old, then becoming skeletons, while a spider plays paddleball. In reality the three, along with the cactus, are playing a virtually reality dancing game. Back at the toilet Rosa manages to plunge out Nelson. Much To Sergio's shock]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Gives it to Mr. Nakamura]'' "Here's your problem, Mr. Nakamura."<br>
''[Later that night, Rosa is in bed with Hector and Sergio]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Buenas noches."<br>
''[Turns off the light only for Rosa to turn it back on]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Buena noches my foot! I'm too worried to sleep. Mi Bobbito didn't take his sleeping helmet!" ''[She throws the helmet knocking Sergio into her snoring husband's mouth]'' "What if he falls out of bed?!"<br>
''[She imagines Bobby sleeping on a pull out couch bed with his hermana while hugging the cactus. He falls out of bed, which is mounted over the entire city, and lands With a green cloud of crossbones and his skull. In reality, Bobby does fall out of bed, but lands on a pile of pillows and keeps sleeping]''
----
''[Morning arrives, Bobby and Ronnie Anne are prepared to enter the apartment. Their Abuela grabs them and hugs them inside]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mis niños! I missed you so much!" ''[Lets them go]'' "Are you okay? Was it terrible? Did you have an awful time?" ''[Looks inside Bobby's mouth]'' "You must be starving. Look at you. come with me." ''[Takes them to the table, where Hector and Maria are waiting, there's a pile of tacos]'' "Eat, eat." ''[Swats Hector's hand when he tries to take a taco]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Actually, we had the best time."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Shoves the tacos onto the floor]'' "What!?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yeah, Dad's apartment is amazing. He has central AC and a bathtub the size of a pool!"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "And he bought Ronnie Anne a new video game console, and he got me a new tablet to keep at his place."<br>
'''Maria:''' "That's great, guys."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mmm-hmm, great." ''[Scoots away a few inches, then grabs her esposo and hija, drags them into the kitchen, and closes the shutter]'' "Don't you see what's happening? Arturo's trying to make the kids like him better than us! it's just like what happened to my gomare Wonita's, best friend's, primo's hairdresser!"<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Rolls her eyes, sighing]'' "Here we go."<br>
''[Hector groans]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Her kids liked ''her'' ex-husband's apartment so much, that they wanted to spend more and more time there, with him, and pretty soon, she barely knew her own kids."<br>
'''Maria:''' "Mom, you're being ridiculous."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Okay, fine, I'll just let this go." ''[Maria walks away, satisfied. Hector turns to leave as well, when Rosa grabs him]'' "We're not letting this go! We just got those kids!"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Why do I have to be involved? Do I at least get a snack?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Fine, I'll make you a burrito." ''[Gets the ingredients out of the fridge and gets cooking]'' "Now listen. This week, I'm going to show the kids, that there's no better home then right here." ''[Unknowingly puts Sergio into the burrito, and adds hot sauce]'' "And you, you're going to get them bigger, better, expensive gadgets."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Say what now?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Still putting hot sauce on Sergio]'' "This is important Hector! It's not the time to be cheap."<br>
'''Hector:''' "But-"<br>
''[Rosa puts the Sergio burrito in her husband's mouth, which sets on fire from all the hot sauce]''
----
''[Bobby is about to take out the garbage]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Bobbito, you don't have to take out the trash. Hector can do that."<br>
''[Throws the garbage bag on her sleeping husband. Later, Sid and Ronnie Anne are in her room. Sid is unpacking a bag, and Rosa in the doorway]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Wow, you've never let me have a sleepover before, Abuela. What's the occasion?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Oh, it's nothing, Ronalda. I just love you. Mira, I made you this too."<br>
''[Rosa moves the bed post, and a second bed appears on the top. Sid and Ronnie Anne can't believe it]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Bunk beds!"<br>
''[Later, Hector is bringing an old arcade console to the apartment]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[In disbelief]'' "This is the game you bought them?!"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Sighs]'' "Hey, this baby's a classic!" ''[Taps on it, which makes it fall apart]'' "Chihuahua. Good thing I also bought this tablet."<br>
''[Takes out a piece of cardboard with stickers on it, and presses them making beeping sounds]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Smacks it onto the floor]'' "Hector Rodrigo Casagrande Gufieres, I should have known you'd be cheap! Thanks for nothing."<br>
''Just then, Ronnie Anne walks by on her phone]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yeah, Sid. My weekend was super fun! Dad took us go-kart racing and indoor rock climbing."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Eavesdropping]'' "So, they think ''he's'' the fun one? Well, I can be the coolest abuela around."<br>
''[Transition of a picture of 'Cool Abuela']''
----
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Are you sure you wanna do this, Abuela?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[On a skateboard, with Sergio, a helmet, a pillow strapped to her back, and clinging onto a tree]'' "Of course. I've always wanted to "shred"."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Here, let me help."<br>
''[Gives her abuela a push, Rosa is scared at first, but then sees it's not so bad]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Huh? Oh, look! I'm doing it!"<br>
''[She's headed for the ramp, she and Sergio panic, roll up, and roll backwards, then crash]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Comes out from under Rosa]'' "You really stuck the landing there."<br>
''['Cool Abuela'. Next she's playing kickball with Bobby]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Okay, Bobby. Pitch me the ball."<br>
''[Bobby rolls the ball, Rosa goes for it, but misses and falls over]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "You're out!" ''[Rosa angrily looks at him]'' "I mean, are you okay?"<br>
''['Cool Abuela. Back at the apartment, Ronnie Anne is wearing a Yoon Kwan t-shirt, and Rosa has a matching one, which doesn't really fit too well]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "It's great you wanna learn about K-pop, Abuela."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "You know me. Can't get enough Ten is Evening!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "It's Twelve is Midnight." ''[Rosa chuckles. Ronnie Anne starts the music]'' "They're known for their choreography." ''[Dances]'' "Now you try."<br>
''[Rosa tries to do the dance, but falls on the floor. Sergio dances in]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "It's all in the hips, baby."<br>
''[Transition of 'Sore Abuela']''

''[The next weekend, Rosa brings breakfast for Bobby and Ronnie Anne]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Huevos con chorizos para mis bebes. Pretty great week, huh? So, what do you want to do today? Monster trucks? Carnival?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, we're going to Dad's."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Tightly grips onto a chair]'' "But I thought we were spending this weekend together."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Well, Dad got the weekend off."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "And Mom said it was okay, so."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Starts squeezing the chair]'' "I see. Well, that's, nice." ''[Crushes the chair in her hands. Maria innocently walks by, and Rosa grabs her by the sweater and pulls her away]'' "This is just like what happened in my telenovela! Those kids loved it at their Dad's so much, that they moved in with him, and when he got a job in Turkey, they moved there, and then they started a rock band, and then-"<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Stopping Rosa]'' "Mom, where are you going with this?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "What if Arturo moves back to Peru, and the kids want to go with him?"<br>
'''Maria:''' "No one is moving to Peru anytime soon. Arturo just got here, so the kids are excited, that's all. Seriously, let it go."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Okay, I'll let it go." ''[Maria walks away satisfied, And Rosa grabs Sergio]'' "We're not letting it go! The kids like Arturo's apartment too much!"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "We can fix that."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Exactly. We just have to make it bad enough that mis bebes will want to come home."
----
''[Later, Rosa and Sergio pop out of the bushes outside Arturo's apartment, and tiptoe up to the door]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "We should have an hour 'til they get back. He took them to the batting cages, so dangerous. Sergio, you go through the mail slot and open the door."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Roger that!"<br>
''[Sergio goes into the mail slot, and gets stuck, Rosa gets annoyed, pushes him in, and knocks]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Sergio, open the door!"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Pops his head out, giggling]'' "What's the password?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Infuriated]'' "How about "bird soup"!?!"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Opens the door]'' "Jeez, learn to take a joke."<br>
''[Inside, Rosa is working behind the TV]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Let's see how the kids like this place without their fancy cable." ''[Reaches for something]'' "And now for my secret weapon, crickets." ''[Opens a box full of crickets, which go all over the apartment, Sergio likes what he sees. Rosa talks while Sergio eats the crickets]'' "Perfecto. These grillos won't let anyone sleep tonight." ''[Snags Sergio's tail]'' "Sergio, stop eating the secret weapon!" ''[Sergio eats one more]'' "Now, I'm going to go cut the hot water. You keep an eye out for Arturo and the kids."<br>
''[Rosa walks off, and Sergio sees the virtual reality dance goggles]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Ooh, Sergio like!"<br>
''[Sergio puts them on and starts singing 'Ooh, girl'. Meanwhile, Arturo and the kids return, Bobby with an ice pack on his head]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "We didn't have to leave. I'm okay. It was pretty slow for a fast ball." ''[Removes the ice pack, revealing a large bump, then gasps when he sees his catchers mitt]'' "Wow, when did my hand get so big?"<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Come on, I'll make you a torta. It'll make you feel better Bobby."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Yum."<br>
''[Walks straight into the closed door]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Ouch! That must have hurt."<br>
''[The sound gets Sergio's attention, he looks through the mail slot while Arturo and Ronnie Anne are looking over Bobby]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "They're here! Hide!"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Sergio, you were supposed to be watching for them! You're fired."<br>
''[The door unlocks, and the two jump into the couch bed, shoving each other for room. Arturo, and the kids walk in, unaware]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Who wants some tortas?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I do!"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!" ''[Bobby then looks over and sees his reflection on the TV]'' "Ooh! Hey, look, I'm on TV!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Here, why don't you sit down Bobby?" ''[Takes him to the couch, and tries to use the TV]'' "Weird, what's up with the TV?" ''[All that's showing is the weather]'' "Every channel's the same."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Inside the couch]'' "How are we going to get out of here?"<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Every man for himself!"<br>
''[Sergio slips out from the couch and makes it to the window, he opens the window, and laughs, until the window closes on his foot, making him yelp in pain. Bobby hears this, looks over, and sees Sergio covering his beak]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Not realizing that Sergio's not supposed to be there]'' "Hi, Sergio."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Thinking her hermano's still delirious]'' "Boy, you really got bopped good."<br>
''[Sergio closes the curtains, as Arturo returns, unhappy]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Que tranças? There's no hot water."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No worries, Dad. Abuela can fix that. She can fix anything."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Oh, yeah. She can also cook anything and pretty much do anything. She's amazing." ''[Rosa, still in the couch, is so touched she tears up. Bobby dials his shoe]'' "I'll just give her a call." ''[His shoe doesn't answer]'' "Weird, it's not getting through."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Takes the shoe]'' "Let me try."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne dials her Abuela, who's phone rings inside the couch. She and Bobby open the couch bed and find Rosa]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne & Bobby:''' "Abuela?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "That's so funny. We were just calling you. How did you get here so fast?"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks, and opens the window again]'' "It was all her idea! See ya, suckers!"<br>
''[The window closes itself again and Sergio flies right into it. Ronnie Anne grabs him]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Rosa? What are you doing? Que haces aqui?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I can explain everything. I was worried that you kids were having so much fun with your dad, that you'd want to live with him forever. I thought you might even move to Peru. So I came up with a plan to wreck your apartment. Sergio was helping me."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "You can't prove anything!"<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Ay, Rosa, what are you talking about? I never planned on the kids moving in with me."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Where'd you get that crazy idea, Abuela?"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Escapes Ronnie Anne]'' "Her two o'clock telenovela."<br>
''[Rosa clasps Sergio's beak shut, and Arturo joins her on the couch]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "You know, the whole time I was away in Peru, I couldn't imagine Ronalda and Roberto in better hands. I love that they're with the whole familia. They're both so happy and doing so well."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yeah, home is always gonna be with you, Abuela. Right, Bobby?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Still having a concussion]'' "I'm Bobby."<br>
''[Rosa gives Arturo a dirty look]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Nervously laughs]'' "Don't worry, he should be fine in a couple of hours."<br>
''[Rosa smirks, and hugs her niños]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mis bebes!"<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Whispers to Rosa]'' "And just so you know, I don't plan on being 'super fun dad' all the time. Skateboarding is much harder than I thought." ''[Rubs his lower back]'' "Ay, mis pompis."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Rubs her own back]'' "I hear that."
----
''[The next weekend, the kids and Arturo are waving goodbye to Rosa outside the apartment, Rosa is perfectly fine with the kids spending the weekend with their padre]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Adios! have a great time! Bobby," ''[Ushers him to come closer, which he does]'' "I packed your sleeping helmet."<br>
''[Bobby gives her a thumbs up, and takes off, Rosa closes the door, her hija is right behind it]''<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Smugly]'' "Wow, Mom, you're okay with them going to Arturo's now?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I was always okay with it."<br>
''[Maria walks off, and Arturo pops in]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Rosa, gracias su través. You fixed everything in my apartment. But, uh, I'm having a weird cricket problem. Do you know how to get rid of them?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Holds up Sergio]'' "Best cricket hunter I know."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Puts a napkin around his neck]'' "Dinner time!"
