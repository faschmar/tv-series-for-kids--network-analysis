{{Transcript}}
''[In the Casagrande apartment, a vacuum is seen, followed by Rosa's back shaking as she dances while vacuuming. On the couch, Hector is sleeping and Carlos reading a book, Rosa vacuums under his feet.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Startled]'' "Dah!"<br>
''[Carlota opens the window from the kitchen to the living room.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[Loudly, over the vacuum]'' "Abuela! Can you hold off vacuuming for a few minutes?" ''[holds up her laptop]'' "I'm doing a live makeup tutorial!"<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[stops vacuuming]'' "No problem, mija!" ''[gets out her duster]'' "I have to dust anyway."<br>
''[Rosa dusts Hector, which wakes him up. Hector coughs. Enter Bobby singing and dancing to music on his headphones.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[Angrily]'' "Bobby!"<br>
''[Carlota growls and shuts the window.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Loudly]'' "What's wrong with her?"<br>
''[Enter Frida]''<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Gasps excitedly]'' "I'm so excited, ''mi amor''! A very hip gallery owner wants to display my art installation next week!"<br>
''[Carlos gets up and holds hands with Frida.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "I'm so proud of you."<br>
'''Hector:''' "What will the art installation be?"<br>
'''Frida:''' "I want it to be a surprise, but I will say that Carlos is going to be an essential part of it."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Just don't make me a human bird feeder again, por favor."<br>
''[A flashback to when Frida did that, Carlos is covered in birdseed dangling by his feet from a tree, two birds are pecking on him, much to his discomfort, as a photographer is taking pictures. End flashback.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Don't worry mi amor, this installation is more up your alley."<br>
''[Frida winks at Carlos.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Off-screen]'' "Excuse me!" ''[Ronnie Anne stands in the hallway with her skateboard.]'' "Who is responsible for this?" ''[Points to a scratch on her skateboard.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Ooh, well, the skateboard was popularized by a man named Larry Stevenson, who wanted to design--"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I mean, who's responsible for this huge scratch? Abuela, did you use my board to move the fridge again?"<br>
'''Rosa''': "No, no, no. I don't need it anymore." ''[She lifts up the whole TV stand with one arm and dusts the floor underneath.]'' "I've been working out!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Surprised]'' "Uh, okay. I gotta find out who did this!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne takes off. Suddenly, Lalo barks and runs into the living room.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Come back here, Lalo! We're not done with the tutorial!"<br>
''[Lalo, with makeup on, licks Bobby, and puckers.]''<br>
----
''[That night, Ronnie Anne is sleeping in her bed, when her door is slowly opened, an arm grabs Ronnie Anne's skateboard, the door closes waking Ronnie Anne up.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What was that?" ''[Falls out of bed, with her blanket over her, she takes it off and gets into a fighting position.]'' Who's there?" ''[She looks around and sees nobody's there, and neither is her skateboard. A filled-in outline of her skateboard pops up in pink. She gasps.]'' "My board is gone!" ''[A figure with an orange hoodie looks around and closes the apartment door, Ronnie Anne chases after them.]'' "Hey! Get back here!" ''[The figure jumps out of the building, clicks their heels, and starts skating away, Ronnie Anne still after them. The figure does a trick on a statue, Ronnie Anne still follows, she comes to a stop, out of breath, and notices the half-pipe, the figure is doing tricks on it and Ronnie Anne gasps.]'' "A Musky Toe Scrape? A ''Cucaracha'' Nose Dive? ''[Amazed]'' Oh man, a Half-Back-Slip-Slap Nosy Bunk?" ''[Shakes her head aggressively, remembering.]'' All right, shred time's over, thief!"<br>
''[The figure takes off his hood revealing himself to be Carlos, who wobbles a little at being caught, but sheepishly smiles.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Tío Carlos?! You're the one using my skateboard?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "I'm so sorry, Ronnie Anne, ever since you moved in, I've gotten the itch to ride again."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "But you? A skateboarder? No offense, but how?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "It all started in college when I discovered that skateboarding was the most efficient method of getting around campus."<br>
''[Flashback to a young Carlos skating his way around campus, he does some tricks, and flies past a young Frida.]''<br>
'''Young Frida:''' ''[Gasps]'' "Que guapo."<br>
''[Carlos skates past the campus library, does a backflip over the return box, putting his book inside, and does a rail slide past five students.]''<br>
'''Five Students:''' "Carlos X!" ''[The flashback changes to Carlos' phone.]'' "Carlos X!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Amazed]'' "Wow, Carlos X? This is really you?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Well, it was. But then Frida and I had kids and she worried that I'd get hurt. She made me promise to quit skateboarding forever. Which is why I should probably stop now."<br>
''[Carlos hands the skateboard to Ronnie Anne.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "But you can't. Not before teaching me some of your tricks."<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Sighs]'' "I don't know, Ronnie Anne."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Please? Just for a little while?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Okay, but we have to be careful. Frida can't find out."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Deal! Same time tomorrow? I've got a spare board you can borrow."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Oh, that would be most gnarly!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We gotta update your slang."<br>
----
''[The next night, Frida is sleeping in her bed, when Ronnie Anne and Carlos put Lalo into the bed. Carlos sets up a baby monitor and camera next to the bed.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Baby monitor and camera, to keep tabs on Frida."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne gives a thumbs-up. Later, Carlos and Ronnie Anne are back in the skate park. Carlos observes Frida and Lalo.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Okay, all good."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Great. Can you show me the trick you did in this video? It was really cool." ''[shows him the video.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Oh yes, the Willy Foot rail slide. Now, the key to this trick is simple physics."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne performs a skate trick by sliding on steel bar and landing on ground.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yes! Woo-hoo!"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "That was sick and tight. Did I say that right?<br>
''[The baby monitor gives a signal.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Talking through sleep]'' "Ugh, mi amor..." ''[Lalo licks Frida's face and she gets out of bed.]'' "I can't sleep with you drooling on my neck."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Ay, Frida's up! We gotta get back!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne and Carlos go home quickly. Carlos throws his stuff to Ronnie Anne.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Good luck!"<br>
''[Frida is pouring water in a glass, while Carlos sneaks behind her. Carlos takes Lalo off the bed, resulting in crashing off-screen, and goes to bed. Frida returns to bed as well. Lalo leaves, annoyed.]''
----
''[The next morning, Ronnie Anne is eating a sandwich and looking at a skate magazine, while sleepy Carlos is trying to put a new diaper on Carlitos, yawning.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "If you keep yawning all day, Tia Frida's going to know something's up."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "I'm just not used to being up that late. ''[Yawns]'' I'm so tired."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[chuckles]'' "I can tell, you're putting a diaper on the skateboard."<br>
''[Carlos realizes he did'' indeed ''put a diaper on the skatebord. Carlitos giggles.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Offscreen]'' "Now where did I put my keys?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Tia Frida's coming, I have an idea."<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Coming in and showing her keys.]'' "Morning, familia! Everything's good?"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne is holding the skatebaord, as a pretend baby, and Carlos is holding the skate magazine, both are wearing nervous grins.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne and Carlos'''  "Ha ha ha, yep."<br>
'''Frida:''' "Well, I'm off to meet the gallery owner."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Adiós, good luck!"<br>
''[Frida goes out the appartment. Carlos sighs in relief.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "So, same time tonight?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Moves the magazine aside, showing Carlitos is eating the sandwich and has jelly all over him.]'' "Oh, I don't know. It's pretty dangerous, and Lalo almost blew our cover last night."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Aww, could you just teach me one more trick?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Okay, one last trick and that's it."<br>
----
''[Later at night in the skate park, Ronnie Anne and Carlos are on each end of the half-pipe.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Now remember, the key is to pass each other at our highest vertical points, and quickly swap the boards."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne nods, and they go for it, they successfully swap the boards.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "That was amazing."<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Stretches]'' "Whoo, I'm just glad we pulled it off, because honestly," ''[Yawns]'' "If there was ever a time I was gonna get injured, it was doing that trick."<br>
''[Just then, Carlos nearly nods off, but his foot is still on the board; he falls to the grounnd, and clutches his leg yelling in excruciating pain.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Tío Carlos! Are you okay?!"<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Gets up, his leg shaking.]'' "I think so-" ''[His leg buckles, and he falls down again.]'' "Upon further analysis;" ''[holds up his broken leg]'' "I'm not okay. Oh! Frida's gonna kill me."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No she won't, I'll find a way to hide your injury, I promise." ''[Throws her board onto the ground, like a stretcher.]'' "Now hop on."<br>
''[Carlos sits on the skateboard and Ronnie Anne wheels him off.]''
----
''[The next morning, they're in Ronnie Anne's room, Ronnie Anne bandaging Carlos' leg.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Wow, you're a real pro."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I learned how to do this watching my mom at work. Okay, how's that?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Gets up, groaning]'' "Feels pretty good, but Frida's definitely going to know I'm hurt with all this bandaging."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Already thought of that," ''[Picks up some fur boots.]'' "boots from Carlota's closet."<br>
''[The two walk into the living area, where Frida, Carlitos and Carl are. All three notice their esposo and padre's new look.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Papa, what happened?" ''[Feels the boots]'' "Are you turning into bigfoot?" ''[Realizes]'' "Will that happen to me?!" ''[Takes another look; excitedly.]'' "I hope so!"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "I'm just trying out some new boots."<br>
'''Frida:''' "They don't really go with your sweater vest."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No, no, this is the look now."<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Stutters]'' "Yes, ''all'' the professors are wearing them."<br>
''[Just then CJ walks in]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Piggy back ride!"<br>
''[Carlos and Ronnie Anne see Frida looking at him.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Don't worry CJ, I can give you a piggy back ride." ''[Does so]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Ooh! I want one too."<br>
''[Carl jumps on, and the weight is too much for Ronnie Anne, they all fall into a pile. Carlitos sees this and walks over to them, he climbs on top of the pile and hugs them, they all laugh this off. Frida walks over to Carlos.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Don't forget that my art installation is tonight."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Can I get a hint about what I'll be doing in it."<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Flirtatiously]'' "You'll see tonight, mi amor." ''[Leaves]''<br>
''[Carlos and Ronnie Anne are alone.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Uh, oh well, maybe it'll be like last installation, where she had me sleep on a cloud of marshmallows."<br>
''[Flashback to that installation. End flashback.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yeah, it might not be so bad."
----
''[At the installation, Frida is on a large podium with the gallery owner.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Into a mic]'' "I'd like to thank you all for coming, and also thank Romeo, the gallery owner." ''[Romeo waves]'' "For the opportunity to show you all..." ''[Her family watches with anticipation.]'' "this!"<br>
''[The curtains open revealing, a very nervous, Carlos on a giant calculator, using trampolines for buttons.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "That's no comfy marshmallow cloud."<br>
'''Frida:''' "Mi esposo, will now jump on this trampoline calculator, to solve equations! It's a statement, that education should be as fun for everyone," ''[getting mushy towards her esposo]'' "as it is for my love!"<br>
''[Carlos is nervous, yet flattered.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "So creative."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "How does she come up with this stuff?"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Skeptical]'' "I don't get it."<br>
'''Frida:''' "First equation; One plus seven minus two!"<br>
''[Carlos is scared, and does the jumping, painfully.]''<br>
'''Romeo:''' ''[Seeming to recognize Carlos.]'' "Where do I know him from? He looks so familiar."<br>
''[Carlos eventually finishes the equation.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Second equation: Nine times seven divided by three."<br>
''[Carlos starts jumping, but doesn't even get past the seven before falling backwards in pain, he bounces of another button, high up, and grabs one of the curtains, which rips right out of the wall, Carlos falls, and accidentally smashes the calculator. Everyone gasps, and Frida and Ronnie Anne go to check on him.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Still skeptical]'' "I still don't get it. Do we clap now?"<br>
'''Frida:''' "Mi amor! Are you okay?" ''[Notices his bandaged foot.]'' "Wait, why is your foot bandaged up?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Uh, everyone's wearing bandages under their boots, this is the look now."<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Not about to lie again.]'' "I can explain everything, I've been skateboarding again, it was all harmless until, well, it wasn't."<br>
''[Frida is speechless, and Ronnie Anne can't believe this, and their three oldest kids are shocked.]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Dad, you skateboard?"<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[Picks up her boots]'' "In my boots?"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Does this mean I won't turn into bigfoot?!"<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Very upset with her esposo]'' "Carlos! How could you do this?! You promised me that you would never skateboard again, nunca!" ''[In a more hurt tone.]'' "''Nunca''!" ''[Looks away]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Remorseful]'' "I know, I'm sorry about everything."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Sighs, thinks about it, and takes a breath.]'' "If anyone is to blame it's me, when I found out that he was Carlos X, I begged him to sneak out at night and teach me his tricks, he wanted to stop, but I wouldn't let him."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "No, no, it was my fault too."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne is pleased to hear this.]''<br>
'''Romeo:''' "I can't believe this."<br>
'''Frida:''' "I'm so sorry, I'll pay for any damages we caused."<br>
'''Romeo:''' "What? No, no, no, chika, I mean; I can't believe Carlos X is in ''my'' gallery." ''[To Carlos]'' "Ha, I knew you looked familiar, I was a huge fan of yours back in the day." ''[Lifts up his sleeve revealing a Carlos X tattoo.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Amazed]'' "Oh, wow."<br>
''[They shake hands.]''<br>
'''Romeo:''' "Amo loso! It's so great to finally meet you mi hermano."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "''Well'' since you're such a big fan of Carlos X, maybe you could give Frida X another chance at her installation."<br>
'''Romeo:''' "''Well'', I did admire your creativity." ''[Thinks about it]'' "I'll give her another chance, under one condition."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Excited]'' "What is it?"
----
''[At the do over installation.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Muchas gracias todos, thank you for coming, again, and a special thanks to Romeo for this opportunity to show my latest installation, which I call... 'Ode to X'" ''[Snaps her fingers.]''<br>
''[The curtain opens revealing a half pipe, with trampolines everywhere, Carlos on the bottom, with crutches, and Ronnie Anne & Romeo on opposite sides, with their boards. Carlos waves.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Calls up to Romeo]'' "Remember what we practiced!"<br>
'''Romeo:''' ''[Excited]'' "Oh yeah man, Oh I can't believe I get to skate for Carlos X!"<br>
''[Carlos gives Ronnie Anne a thumbs up, she returns it and goes down the half pipe, followed by Romeo. They do the board swap trick, and then perch their boards at the top of the pipe. Ronnie Anne flips onto a trampoline which squirts red paint at the wall, Romeo does the same on his side, squirting yellow paint. The family is awed as they keep going, doing tricks and squirting paint. In the end, what remains is a mural, tributing Carlos X.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Who, like the rest of the family, got covered in paint.]'' "Ah, I get it now."<br>
''[Everyone cheers, when suddenly Romeo's board slips out from under him.]''<br>
'''Romeo:''' ''[Picks up his broken leg.]'' "Tubular!"<br>
''[He passes out, Ronnie Anne, Frida, and Carlos are disgusted by the state of his leg.]''
