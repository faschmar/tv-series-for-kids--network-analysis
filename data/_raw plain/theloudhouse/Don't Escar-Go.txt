''[Open at the McBride house. The gang is admiring the food Clyde has made.]''<br>
'''Zach:''' "That looks delicious."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "I also baked ''pain au chocolat'', ''pain suisse'', and ''croissants''."<br>
''[The gang cheers]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "So, what's the occasion, Clyde?"<br>
'''Zach:''' "Yeah, are you buttering us up for something?" ''[adds butter to a slice of bread and eats it]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "OK, here goes. The reason I created this ''Célébration de'' Friendship Brunch is because I've got..."<br>
''[Flashback to earlier. The phone rings]''<br>
'''Howard:''' "Clyde, can you get that? And please be careful. That phone is older than our 1930's Dust Bowl glasses."<br>
'''Clyde:''' ''[picks up]'' "Hello?"<br>
''[On the other end is Nana Gayle, calling from Sunset Canyon Retirement Home.]''<br>
'''Nana Gayle:''' "Clyde, it's Nana Gayle. Ooh, I've got big news. My best friend, Fleur DuPont, just came to town for a surprise visit. She happens to be the dean of one of the finest cooking academies in the world."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "I know that academy! It's nearly impossible to get in. They wouldn't even let the Queen of England in. Granted, I've heard her sponge cake is bad-"<br>
'''Gayle:''' "Clyde, get your buns over here! And bring your baked goods, too! If Fleur tries them, oh, she's sure to let you in."<br>
''[Clyde happily hangs up. Back to the present.]''<br>
'''Zach:''' "So, what happened?"<br>
'''Clyde:''' "She loved everything I made! In fact, Dean DuPont said I just have to pass one last exam tonight. I have to cook her an entire dinner. If I nail it, I'll be into the academy!"<br>
''[The gang starts celebrating]''<br>
'''Stella:''' "Yeah!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Yeah!"<br>
'''Rusty:''' "Yeah, alright!" ''[sniffs]'' "Clyde, what's wrong?"<br>
'''Clyde:''' ''[sniffs]'' "There's only one drawback: The school's in... Paris."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[despairing]'' "NOOOOOOOOO!" ''[collapses]''<br>
'''Liam:''' "Aw, it's happening again. Clyde's leaving us, just like [[Schooled!|when Lincoln done went to Canada]]."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Let's not lose our heads here. I'm not a thousand percent sure I'm going yet. They might not even pick me."<br>
'''Rusty:''' "Your food is divine." ''[eats some food]'' "Of course you'll get in."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "I'll miss you guys like crazy, but this is an incredible opportunity." ''[starts imagining the foods he'll cook there]'' "Where else can I learn to cook sole meuniére, concombre a la menthe, escargot..."<br>
''[Lincoln rushes into the imagination and brushes it aside.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Wait, Clyde. What if you could learn to cook all those things here in Royal Woods? I know someone who can teach you. Then we wouldn't lose you."<br>
'''Rusty:''' "Ooh, give it a try, Clyde. Please?"<br>
'''Stella:''' "Yeah, we're your crew, table 10 at lunch, the Action News Team! We have to stick together."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "But who are you thinking could teach me?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "I know just the guy."

''[Lynn's Table; Lynn Sr. is dressed in a French outfit and has a fake mustache]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[in a French accent]'' "Bonjour, Clyde. Ready to cook French food?" ''[normal voice]'' "I'm so excited, I can't wait."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Wow, thanks, Mr. Loud. I had no idea you studied French cuisine."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Well, I follow a French cooking vlog, which is basically the same thing. Every time my boy Charcuterie Sheldon goes live, I feel alive!" ''[Walks Clyde to the kitchen. The others grin, thumbs-up each other, and leave.]'' "We're going to make escargot, just like you were gonna learn in Paris."
