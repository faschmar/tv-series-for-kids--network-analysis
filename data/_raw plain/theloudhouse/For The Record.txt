''[At Chavez Acadamy, the skateboard team is sitting on the front steps. Casey reading a magazine. Ronnie Anne and Sid playing rock, paper scissors. Laird is on his phone. And Sameer is blowing a bubble, it pops. Nikki appears balancing five corndogs stacked one on top of the other, on her nose]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Check it out! I finally pulled it off. Corndog tower."<br>
''[Tosses the corndogs to her friends, each catches one]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "Totally epic!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "That is awesome."<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[His corndog having a green substance on it]'' "I hope this is relish."<br>
'''Casey:''' "You think that's epic? One time I got these new sneakers that let me dunk on a ten-foot rim."<br>
''[Flashback to that day, and those sneakers. With sweat dripping down his face Casey dribbles forward. A taller player dives at him but ends up on his stomach. Casey, using the player for a boost, jumps up. The clock is down to four seconds. Casey makes the dunk as the buzzer runs out]''<br>
'''Flashback Casey:''' ''[Beating on his chest]'' "Yeah!"<br>
''[End of flashback]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Bro."<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Epic indeed."<br>
'''Laird:''' "Impressive."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Well one time, I stayed awake for three days straight. I looked like a zombie."<br>
''[Flashback to Sid with a tired face, drool in her mouth, and arms forward. She moans. Everyone screams and runs as she limps forward. One lady trips and holds her hand out to block the oncoming Sid. She screams and keeps screaming, as Sid approaches, and keeps approaching. End of flashback, Sid keeps moaning]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Wow."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "''Pssh''. My turn. Last month I stopped a purse thief on the subway."<br>
''[Flashback to that day. Dona is innocently sitting on the subway when a man in black clothes and a knit cap snatches her purse and runs. She gasps]''<br>
'''Flashback Ronnie Anne:''' "Stop right there!"<br>
''[The man keeps running, Ronnie Anne climbs along the strap handles and chases the man out of the car. The man exits the car but stops in his tracks. Ronnie Anne beat him out of the train and is standing in front of him, she lowers her shades. The man tries to run the other way but Ronnie Anne jumps him and takes the purse back. Donna comes running out]''<br>
'''Dona:''' "Oh my goodness! Thank you so much!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No problem."<br>
''[End of flashback]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Mind blown!"<br>
'''Laird:''' "Incredible. Almost as cool as the time I wrestled a shark."<br>
''[Flashback to Laird scuba dining. A dark shape swims behind him. Laird looks and sees a shark heading in his direction. The shark just barely misses eating Laird whole. The shark swims past, Laird squints at it. The shark circles back around and charges forward. Laird does the same and they play chicken with each other. They collide Laird grabs the shark by the tail, the shark gets Laird in a headlock. But Laird gets the upper hand and pins the shark to the ocean floor. The shark taps out. They return to the surface and Laird offers a fist bump, the shark returns it and they laugh together. End of flashback]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "You even fist bumped after?"<br>
'''Laird:''' "Yeah, I don't hold grudges. What about you, Sameer?"<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Oh, uh… me?" ''[Thinks]'' "Oh, got one. This morning." ''[Flashback to that morning, Sameer is eating cereal in the cafeteria]'' "The cafeteria ran out of milk." ''[The milk carton next to Sameer vanishes]'' "And all I had was water." ''[A bottle of water appears]'' "So I poured it on my cereal." ''[Sameer does so and brings a spoonful to his mouth]'' "And I ate it." ''[Sameer eats the watered cereal, then retches. End of flashback]'' "Pretty epic, huh?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Not impressed]'' "Uh… Yeah. Totally."<br>
''[The bell goes off]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "Love to hear more, but it's time for class."<br>
''[Sameer's friends go inside. He sighs]''
----
''[In the hall, Sameer walks alone, feeling blue]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "A lame cereal story? Good going Sameer." ''[Sameer walks down the hall, still blowing his bubblegum. He takes out his phone]'' "I gotta up my game." ''[Stops and looks something up]'' "''Epic things to do''." ''[Scrolls through a list]'' "Go to the moon… Cure a disease… Break a record? I could try that." ''[Right next to him, Becky is stuffing kids in a locker]'' "I'm gonna break a record!"<br>
'''Becky:''' ''[Heard that]'' "Did you just say you're trying to break a record?"<br>
''[Stuffs the last kid in the locker and closes them in]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Yeah, all my friends have done something epic except for me. But if I can beat some cool record, I have an awesome story to tell."<br>
'''Becky:''' "Lucky for you I know all about breaking records. I mean, I do hold the record for most kids stuffed in a locker."<br>
''[Opens her locker]''<br>
'''Kid in Locker:''' "Can I come out now?"<br>
'''Becky:''' "No. Hand me that big green book."<br>
'''Kid in Locker:''' "Yes, ma'am."<br>
''[Hands it to her and she shows Sameer]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Reads the title]'' "Great Lakes City's Big Book of Epic Records."<br>
'''Becky:''' "If you're gonna break a record, you're gonna need my guidance."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "I'm in. Let's do it."<br>
''[They set off]''<br>
'''Kid in Locker:''' "Good luck, Sameer."<br>
''[Becky closes them all in again]''
----
''[Later the two are in the gym]''<br>
'''Becky:''' "We're gonna start with a fun one. Being hit by the most dodgeballs in ten seconds."<br>
''[Sameer looks and realizes that Dodge and the rest of the dodgeball team are also in the gym]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Gasps]'' "Sounds more like a painful one."<br>
''[The team is ready to fire]''<br>
'''Becky:''' "Pssh, only for you." ''[To the team]'' "Ready, aim… Pummel!" ''[Starts her stopwatch and Sameer yelps as the team opens fire. Ten seconds later, Sameer pops out of a pile of dodgeballs as Becky checks the book]'' "Didn't beat the record! Wanna go again or try something else?"<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Spits a dodgeball out of his mouth]'' "Try something else."<br>
'''Becky:''' "Go again? Cool! Pummel!"<br>
''[Starts the watch again, Sameer yelps again, and the team fires again]''
----
''[Later, Becky and Sameer are in the park, Becky putting Sameer in a cardboard box]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "What's this record?"<br>
'''Becky:''' "It's easy, you just have to stay in the box for an hour." ''[Sameer goes in and Becky takes out a jar]'' "With a thousand fire ants."<br>
''[The jar puffs smoke from the top]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Wait, what?" ''[Becky dumps the ants in and closes the lid. Sameer starts screaming and the box starts jumping around]'' "They burn!"<br>
'''Becky:''' "Well they're not called cuddle ants."<br>
''[Sameer jumps out of the box screaming]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "They're in my underwear!"<br>
''[Runs off, with the ants chasing him]''
----
''[Later, Sameer is wearing a lot of musical instruments]''<br>
'''Becky:''' "Most instruments played at the same time!" ''[Sameer prepares. Suddenly there's a musical sonic boom. Which blew some trees over, blasted Sameer's shoes of and knocked him down. Becky ended up slumped over in a tree]'' "Aw, we forgot the ukelele."
----
''[Next, they're on the subway. Sameer hanging upside down]''<br>
'''Becky:''' "Longest time hanging upside down while being tickled."<br>
''[Takes out a feather, starts her stopwatch and tickles Sameer]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Laughs]'' "I'm laughing but I hate this." ''[Falls, into some green stuff]'' "What did I fall in?"<br>
'''Becky:''' "Oof. You don't wanna know."
----
''[Next, they're back in the park. Becky takes out a clothes peg and sticks it on Sameer]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Ow!"<br>
'''Becky:''' "Most clothespins on a human body." ''[Sameer, most uncomfortably, already has a lot of pins clipped to himself. Becky digs through her bucket]'' "Only a hundred seventy-four more to go."<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Has had enough shakes the pins off]'' "No more!" ''[Throws the bucket away, angry with Becky right now]'' "These records are way too extreme!" ''[sighs]'' "Maybe I'm not meant to break a record. I'm just not good at this stuff."<br>
'''Becky:''' "Well what are you good at?"<br>
'''Sameer:''' "I don't know. Blowing bubbles, skateboarding."<br>
'''Becky:''' ''[Looks in her book]'' "Hmm… How about both at the same time?"<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Huh?"<br>
'''Becky:''' "Check this out. Wheels McBubbly lives up to his name when he skateboarded while blowing a bubble for three hours, twenty-six minutes and twenty-three seconds."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "That one's perfect for me." ''[Takes out some gum]'' "Wheels McBubbly…" ''[Starts chewing]'' "I'm coming for your record."<br>
''[Blows a really big bubble]''
----
''[The next day at school, Sameer's friends are excited for him to break a record]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "This is so cool, Sameer. I never even knew you were into breaking records."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "I have many layers, Ronnie Anne."<br>
'''Casey:''' "You're totally gonna do it."<br>
'''Laird:''' "Yeah."<br>
'''Nikki:''' "You got this."<br>
'''Sid:''' "I'm gonna make a confetti cannon for when you break the record."<br>
'''Becky:''' ''[Getting impatient]'' "Ugh! You guys are breaking the record for giving me the biggest headache! Let's start this! Ready…" ''[Sameer gets on his skateboard]'' "Set…" ''[Sameer chews his gum]'' "Blow!"<br>
''[Sameer blows his bubble and gets skating. Almost running into the principal]''<br>
'''Principal Valenzuela:''' "Woah!"<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Sorry, it's hard to see with the bubble in my face."<br>
'''Principal Valenzuela:''' "Hey! There's no chewing gum ''or'' skateboarding allowed in here."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "But, Principal Valenzuela, he's going for the Great Lakes City record."<br>
'''Principal Valenzuela:''' ''[Gasps]'' "You mean Wheels McBubbly's record? I'll let it slide just this one time. Go Sameer. Ha. You got this."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Thanks." ''[To Becky]'' "How long do I have to go?"<br>
'''Becky:''' "Three hours, twenty-five minutes."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Piece of cake."
----
''[Later, Mr. Suarez has a complex equation on the board]''<br>
'''Mr. Suarez:''' "So who would like to take a crack at this equation." ''[Sameer takes the chalk out of Mr. Suarez's hand and while still skating crosses the equation out. Mr. Suarez is actually impressed]'' "You're correct, this equation is unsolvable."<br>
''[The class cheers]''
----
''[Later, in gym class]''<br>
'''Mrs. Kernicky:''' "Instead of running laps today, I thought we could try fencing."<br>
''[Takes out a fencing foil]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Knowing fencing and bubbles don't mix]'' "Uh-oh." ''[Sameer dodges foil left and right, trying to keep his bubble safe. He makes it past most of the fencers but then sees up ahead. Becky has a foil and her game face on. Quickly ducking under her swing]'' "Becky! What are you doing?"<br>
'''Becky:''' ''[Remembers]'' "Oh, uh… Right." ''[Sees the other fencers approaching and opts to protect Sameer]'' "Back scoundrels! This bubble shall not be ''poppethed''!"
----
''[Later, Sameer's friends are at their favourite table, eating lunch. Sameer is still skating]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Aw man, how do I eat lunch? I hadn't thought ''this'' part through."<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Takes Sameer's luchbox]'' "I got you, Sameer." ''[Checks Sameer's lunch]'' "Let's see… pickles, tuna sandwich, hummus, OJ." ''[Takes out a book and puts Sameer's lunch in it. She then crushes the food by opening and closing the book multiple times. She hums, pushes his lunchbox aside then pours into a glass]'' "Voila! Lunch smoothie."<br>
''[Sameer skates by and takes it]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Drinks]'' "Thanks, Sid." ''[Burps and continues skating]'' "Ugh, gross."
----
''[Later, Becky is walking along in the hall and sees Sameer - still on his skateboard but is looking desperate to pee.]''<br>
'''Becky:''' "You're doing great, Sameer!"<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Thanks, there's just one problem. I have to pee."<br>
'''Becky:''' "Yikes. Uh… Can't you hold it in for…" ''[Checks the watch]'' "forty-five more minutes?"<br>
'''Sameer:''' I've been holding it in for three hours already." ''[Skates into the boy's room]'' "You've got this, Sameer, you've always had good aim." ''[Does his business. After the toilet flushes, he skates out of the bathroom and then goes back in with a mop - which leaves a trail of water - and a wet floor sign, which he leaves by the door]'' "Guess my aim isn't that good afterall."
----
''[Later, Nikki and some other classmates are reading on the front stairs of the school]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Pretty rad that Ms. Galiano let us have class outside today."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Yeah, sure makes it easier to skate with this bubble."<br>
''[Suddenly the wind blows Sameer backwards. The wind keeps blowing, but Sameer actually embraces the wind to do some cool tricks]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Woah. Gnarly moves, Bubble-Boy."
''[Wind and leaves cover the screen for the next scene]''
----
''[Back indoors, soon the time is almost up. Sameer's friends, Becky, Principal Valenzuela and some students are all watching with anticipation and excitement]''<br>
'''Principal Valenzuela:''' "Sameer's gonna break the record, in my school." ''[Chuckles]'' "This is so exciting."<br>
'''Becky:''' "Just ten more seconds."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "You've got this, Sameer."<br>
'''Sid:''' "I'm ready with the confetti cannon."<br>
'''Becky:''' "Five… Four…"<br>
''[--Just then, another teacher comes out the door and claps a pair of chalkboard erasers in front of Sameer, releasing chalk dust.]''<br>
'''Everyone:''' "Three… Two…"<br>
''[The chalk dust gets in Sameer's face. Becky gasps followed by the other skaters. Sameer sneezes from the chalk dust, losing the bubble and falling off his skateboard. The bubble pops all over Laird's face. Ronnie Anne, Nikki and Casey feel bad for Sameer. Suddenly the confetti cannon goes off]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Oops."<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Annoyed; clenching his fist]'' "No! I had it."<br>
'''Becky:''' ''[Scampers away]'' "Super sad, dude. But also kind of funny if you think about it."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Are you okay, Sameer?"<br>
'''Sameer:''' "No, I really wanted to beat a record."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Okay, but why?"<br>
'''Sameer:''' "You all have amazing stories to tell, and I have nothing. I wanted to finally do something as epic as you guys."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, uh… Yeah… About that epic story of mine… I should probably fess up that it wasn't as epic as I said it was."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Please, you caught a purse thief."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Well, not exactly."<br>
''[Flashback to what really happened. Ronnie Anne did jump the man for the purse. But she didn't really have shades on, and the man was actually wearing regular clothes, and Dona wasn't exactly grateful]''<br>
'''Dona:''' ''[Runs up and takes her purse from Ronnie Anne]'' "Hey! I needed my grandson to run my purse to the repair shop before it closed. Thanks for nothin'!"<br>
'''Flashback Ronnie Anne:''' "Oopsie."<br>
''[End of flashback]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "My story was exaggerated too. I didn't stay up for three days straight, but I had a dream that I did."<br>
''[Flashback to Sid the zombie, which is actually just the real Sid's dream, while she's asleep in class. End of Flashback]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "My story about dunking on a ten foot rim went a little differently too."<br>
''[Flashback to what really happened. Casey did dunk the basketball, into what is actually just a kids hoop, the rim is no taller than he is]''<br>
'''Kid:''' "Boo!"<br>
''[End of flashback]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "Well, my wrestling a shark story was a hundred percent true." ''[His friends don't actually believe him]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "Oh come on!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No it wasn't."<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Uninterested]'' "Sure, it was."<br>
'''Laird:''' "It was!" ''[Takes out his phone]'' "I... I have a picture."<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Sarcastically]'' "''Right''. So, all your stories were made up?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Defeated]'' "More like, exaggerated. But, yeah."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "So I'm ''not'' lame for not having an epic story?"<br>
''[Sid, Ronnie Anne, Nikki and Casey all agree]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No way."<br>
'''Sid:''' "You're the coolest."<br>
'''Laird:''' ''[Shows his phone]'' "Okay look, I even have a video."<br>
''[Laird is in fact fist bumping a shark]''<br>
'''Becky:''' ''[Returns, excited]'' "Out of my way, Laird!" ''[Throws Laird away]'' "Huge news! I called the GLC Record Association and told them about all your failures!"<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[Not seeing the up side]'' "Uh… thanks?"<br>
'''Becky:''' "No! You don't understand! You just broke a record for the most failed attempts at breaking records!"<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Really?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Elated]'' "You're officially a record holder!"<br>
'''Casey:''' "So epic!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "You're famous!"<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Awesome!"<br>
'''Kid in Locker:''' ''[Who, along with the other kids, is still in Becky's locker]'' "Woohoo! You did it!"<br>
'''Becky:''' ''[Closes her locker again]'' "Wanna try the one with fire ants again?" ''[Takes out the jar]'' "Then you'd hold ''two'' records."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "Nooo!"<br>
''[Runs away. Becky goes after him]''
