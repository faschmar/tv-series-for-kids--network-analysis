''[In apartment 3A, Adelaide picks up a frog toy, a slimy sponge ball, and her copy of 'The Hoppit', gives bacon bits to the frog on her head and approaches Ronnie Anne.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "Okay, Ronnie Anne, I gave Froggy 2 his bacon bits." ''[Gives all the other stuff to Ronnie Anne.]'' "But remember..."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "He'll wanna watch a movie and have his back massaged later." ''[Froggy 2 agrees.]'' "On it."<br>
''[Froggy 2 jumps into Adelaide's hands, and Ronnie Anne gives him a massage.]''<br>
'''Adelaide:''' "You're the best pet sitter ever."<br>
''[Hugs Ronnie Anne very tightly.]''<br>
'''Becca:''' "Thank you, Ronnie Anne, especially for pet sitting all of our ''extra'' animals this weekend, too."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Yeah, mom was totally in a jam with the zoo's reptile house getting remodelled."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Happy to help."<br>
'''Becca:''' ''[To Rosa]'' "And, Mrs. Casagrande, technically I know we shouldn't have any reptiles in the building, so I can't thank you enough for letting them stay."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Well I wouldn't normally bend the rules but I couldn't leave these cute animalitos without a home. Pero mira, it's just this once, and just this weekend, or we'll ''both'' be in big trouble with Mr. Scully. He's terrified of reptiles, especially snakes."<br>
''[Outside the building, a horn is honked.]''<br>
'''Becca:''' ''[To her daughters]'' "That must be your dad, girls."<br>
'''Adelaide:''' ''[Hugs Froggy 2]'' "I'll miss you so much, you be a good froggy for Ronnie Anne." ''[Froggy 2 jumps into his cage and Adelaide says her goodbyes to the other reptiles. To the tortoise]'' "Bye-bye, Tortilla." ''[To the lizards]'' "See you later, Iggy and Gus." ''[To the snake]'' "Bye, Cam." ''[Sees the cage is empty]'' "Cam?"<br>
''[The snake turns itself visible.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, that's why his name is Cam, he can camouflage himself, I see why you need to use a bell."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Actually it's short for Cameron, but that works, too."
----
''[Outside the building, the Changs' are in their tram.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Have a good trip and don't worry about Mr. Scully, he's never here."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne and Rosa wave as the Changs' leave. Suddenly...]''<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' ''[Right behind them]'' "Scully here."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What's he doing here? Quick, Abuela, hide the lizards."<br>
''[Rosa stuffs Iggy and Gus into her dress.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mr. Scully, we weren't expecting you."<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "I'm here to install the new smoke detectors. Figure since the Changs' are away I'll start there."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Wait," ''[Stops him]'' "you can't install anything on an empty stomach, Abuela was just about to start cooking."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[The lizards crawling through her dress.]'' You know me, always cooking."<br>
''[Iggy and Gus are still crawling in places they don't belong.]''<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "Are you feeling okay? You seem a little jumpy."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Abuela, that's enough salsa dancing."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Playing along]'' "I always dance when I cook."<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "Well, I never turn down a good meal, and after breakfast, we can start the installations." ''[Rosa and Ronnie Anne let him in the building. Singing to himself.]'' "''♫ Scully's getting breakfast.♫''"<br>
''[Rosa shakes the lizards out through her sleeve.]''
----
''[Up in the Changs' apartment, Ronnie Anne has her three oldest primos, her hermano, and Sergio.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Guys, I need your help, if Mr. Scully finds out that the Changs' are breaking the 'no reptile' rule..."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Your best friend's family will get the boot?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Exactly, so we need to hide the reptiles while Mr. Scully's installing the new smoke detectors."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne's primos and Sergio agree.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Unwilling]'' "Nope, sorry, I am not a fan of tiny dinosaurs."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Guys, this is serious, Abuela could get in trouble, too"<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Groans]'' "Fine, I'll help, but I'm not touching them."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Bobby! Don't move! The snakes on your back!"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "What?" ''[Freaks out, starts taking his shirt off and jumping around.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Fistbumps a lizard, snickering.]'' "Chump."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Guys, focus, Scully will be here soon, so let's get these reptiles to the secret room. Sergio, you keep eyes on Scully, we need to know where he is at all times."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Dawns some shades. Squawks.]'' "Born to spy."<br>
''[Flies off. Meanwhile, Bobby is in his underwear and tripped over a chair. Dazed.]'' "Is it gone?
----
''[The kids head downstairs, they almost reach their floor, when suddenly Mr. Scully some out of the apartment.]''<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "That was delicious, Rosa."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Seeing the reptiles]'' "Oh, but you haven't had your, uh, breakfast dessert."<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "Intriguing, but, I should get to the Changs'." ''[The kids' gasp]'' "Actually, I think I'll start with the new room in the basement."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Change of plans."<br>
'''CJ:''' "It's okay, I know a hiding place."
----
''[Later, Frida is humming into the bathroom, ready to take a shower, she opens the curtain and is about to get in when she sees her niños, sobrinos, and five reptiles. She freaks out.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We can explain."<br>
''[But before she can, Cam the snake slithers onto Frida's leg and Frida really freaks out. She shakes Cam off, grabs the towel off her head and starts swatting everyone.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Mr. Scully's headed this way." ''[Frida screams again and starts swatting Sergio.]'' "Don't kill the messenger."<br>
''[Frida throws down the towel and runs. Sergio drops.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Come on, I know another spot."<br>
''[Next, they are in the stock room, where their abuelo is taking a nap.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Are you sure he won't mind?"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[The lizard on his head mimicking him.]'' "''Pssh'', trust me, I've seen Abuelo nap through worse."<br>
''[Suddenly, Hector grabs Cam in his sleep.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Dreaming about his beautiful esposa.]'' "Rosa, ven, snuggle with me."<br>
''[Carlota and CJ chuckle at this. Ronnie Anne tries to pull Cam out of Hector's arms.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Flies in, squawks]'' "Scully incoming. Go! Go! Go!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne rescues Cam, and Hector falls onto a sack of beans.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Still asleep, still dreaming of Rosa.]'' "Come here, my squishy Rosa."<br>
''[Starts making out with the sack, Carl is revolted as they leave. In the mercado, the kids' tiptoe past Mr. Scully, who has his back turned putting up the new smoke detector. Suddenly a fly buzzes past, Froggy 2 sees it and shoots his tongue at it.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Feeling tension]'' "Huh?"<br>
''[Froggy's tongue is stuck to a piñata. The kids pull and fall backwards out of the store, and set off someone's car alarm. Mr. Scully looks in the direction of the noise. In the lobby, the kids sigh with relief.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "That was close."<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' ''[Outside]'' "See you later, Hector, sorry I woke you, you need me I'll be on the fourth floor"<br>
'''Carl:''' "He's done already?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hide!"<br>
'''CJ:''' "Where?"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Gets an idea]'' "We can send the reptiles on a little ride, but they'll need a chaperone."<br>
''[In the hallway, Bobby is covered in reptiles.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Freaking out]'' "Oh! Why can't they be in cages?"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Because this is funnier."<br>
''[Without concern, Ronnie Anne, Carlota and CJ pick Bobby up, Carl opens the trash chute, and they throw him in. Bobby and the reptiles slide down the chute and land in the dumpster. A montage starts, of the kids running with the reptiles, Mr. Scully right behind them, following them up the stairs, through the apartments, through the halls, behind the water tower. Finally, Carl is trying to shove Bobby into a washing machine with the reptiles, Bobby refuses.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "This is the only hiding place left!"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "But I don't like the spin cycle."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Flies in]'' "Scully's done, he's headed home."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yes! We're in the clear."
----
''[Back in the Changs' apartment, the kids return with the animals.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "I can't believe our plan worked."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Of course it did, we kicked butt."<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Notices something about his cage.]'' "Why is this cage empty?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, that's Cam's cage, he's probably just camouflaging himself."<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Feels inside the cage]'' "Nope, he's gone."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "So you're telling me that a snake with the power to be invisible is loose in the building?!" ''[Faints]''
----
''[They return to their apartment.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We need to warn Abuela about the missing sna-" ''[Enters, and sees Mr. Scully.]'' "Ah, hey, Mr. Scully."<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "Hey kids, hope you don't mind, I invited myself to dinner. I couldn't resist Rosa's delicious chiles rellenos."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Nervous]'' "Great news."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Also nervous]'' "I love when she snakes those." ''[Ronnie Anne elbows him]'' "I mean makes those."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne pulls everyone aside.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We have to find that snake before anyone else does. You guys stay here, have dinner, and cover for me. I'll find the snake."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "But it could be anywhere."<br>
''[Suddenly a scream is heard.]''<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "Was that Mr. Nakamura?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh yeah, it must be 'horror movie night'."<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "Sounds like it was coming from the basement."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yeah, he likes to watch down there, it's creepier, I'm gonna go check it out."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne goes to the laundry room, and find Mr. Nakamura and Nelson playing 'tug of war' with Cam over a red cloth.]''<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' "Snakes?! Nelson, we're moving."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Nobody panic! I've got it under control." ''[Mr. Nakamura and Nelson make a run for it, trampling Ronnie Anne. Ronnie Anne gets up and she and Cam stare each other down.]'' "Alright snake, you're coming with me." ''[A ball of socks rolls past, Sancho plays western standoff music on a harmonica. Ronnie Anne squints at Cam. Cam squints back and hisses at her. They continue squinting and Ronnie Anne jumps at Cam and they roll into a pile of laundry. Ronnie Anne is dazed and the orange scarf on her head is revealed to be Cam, who escapes. Ronnie Anne chases him upstairs.]'' "Hey! Get back here!"<br>
''[In the Casagrandes' apartment a crashing sound is heard.]''<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "What was that?" ''[Someone screams again]'' "And that?"<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Uh, that was..." ''[Thinks]'' "..Miranda... and she's practicing for a play where she finds out that her fiance is an alien."<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "That would make me scream, too."<br>
''[Outside her apartment, Mrs. Kernicky is doing yoga. She leaves a downward dog position, and Cam is revealed to be doing the same right next to her. Mrs. Kernicky looks, sees a snake, and scream. She takes her mat and runs into her apartment. Cam leaves and camouflages himself just as Ronnie Anne arrives and doesn't see him.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Dang it!"<br>
''[Back in the Casagrandes' apartment.]''<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "Was that Miranda again? How many alien husbands does she have?"<br>
'''Carlota:''' "No, that was um... Mrs. Kernicky, practicing her... opera singing."<br>
''[Up on the roof, Georgia is laying back in the hammock, having an iced tea, when she realizes something. She opens her mouth and Cam slides out and drinks her iced tea.]''<br>
'''Georgia:''' ''[Scared]'' "Snake."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Runs up]'' "Georgia! Don't move."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne jumps into the hammock to get Cam, but the hammock starts spinning out of control and Cam gets flung out. Leaving Ronnie Anne and Georgia tangled up, Georgia giving Ronnie Anne a dirty look. Back in the apartment.]''<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "Now that noise was too loud to ignore, someone could be in trouble."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Who wants more sides?"<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "I guess it can wait. Good thing I wore my stretchy pants."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne runs downstairs and hears Cam’s bell in the other apartment.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Looks inside]'' "I’ve got you now, Cam" ''[Gasps. The apartment is filled with paintings and sculptures of snakes. Ronnie Anne walks past one of a snake being eaten by a golden eagle, which Cam is revealed to be blending into, he slithers away. Ronnie Anne walks up to her sobbing Tía.]'' "What’s with all the snake art Tía Frida?"<br>
'''Frida:''' "I’m working through my trauma!"<br>
''[Frida is painting herself as a snake and still sobbing. Suddenly, Ronnie Anne hears the bell again, she chases the sound and sees Cam slither into the apartment where Mr. Scully is.]’’<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh-no!" ‘’[Ronnie Anne comes in and looks under the throw pillows until Mr. Scully looks at her.]’’ "Hey."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Finally, come sit, Ronalda."<br>
''[There’s a bell in the guacamole. Ronnie Anne gasps, she waves her arms around to warn everyone and starts mimicking a snake, but nobody understands.]’’<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ‘’[Whispers]’’ "Snake! Here!"<br>
''[They still don’t understand. Ronnie Anne does another snake dance.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Ooh, are we playing charades? I know, you’re a rat, trying to get out of a burrito. Nailed it."<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "Nah, that’s not it, Hector. Let's see, you're long, and you're wiggly, you’re spaghetti." ''[Just then, Cam emerges from the guacamole and Carlitos notices followed by CJ, Rosa and Carlota. Mr. Scully is still unaware.]'' "Oh, you're a…"<br>
''[Prepares to dip a chip in the guac.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No!"<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' ''[With a full mouth, picks up the chip, and Cam along with it.]'' "Snake!"<br>
''[Bobby faints and Mr. Scully starts choking on his food.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Not even noticing Mr. Scully.]'' "I still think it’s a rat in a burrito."<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[Actually noticing]'' "Oh-no! He's choking!"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Pajarito! Pajarito!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Abuela! That never works." ''[Slaps Mr. Scully on the back.]''<br>
''[Mr. Scully turns purple, just then, Cam wraps himself around Mr. Scully's chest and squeezes until Mr. Scully regurgitates the food, which hits Bobby in the face as he's getting up, causing him to go down again. Mr. Scully catches his breath.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne''' ''[Grabs Cam]'' "Got him!"<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "What is that thing doing here?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Mr. Scully, we can explain. The Changs' have nowhere else to put their reptiles."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "It was only for the weekend, it won’t ever happen again. Nunca."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[In unison]'' "Don't be mad."<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[In unison]'' "We're sorry."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[In unison]'' "I had nothing to do with this."<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "I’m not thrilled that you allowed this Mrs. Casagrande, you broke the rules, your family broke the rules, the Changs’ broke the rules. You’re all out!" ''[Everyone gasps]'' "..Is what I’d normally say, but that brave and noble snake saved my life." ''[Everyone is relieved, including Cam.]'' "Maybe I misjudged the scaly little guy, I mean that darn snake is a hero."<br>
''[Cam is flattered.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "So does that mean?"<br>
'''Mr. Scully:''' "From here on out, I will allow reptiles in the building."<br>
''[Everyone cheers. Bobby finally gets up.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Walks out]'' "I am done with reptiles for today." ''[Goes to the other apartment, confided.]'' "Snake free in 2B." ''[Gasps in shock when he sees all Frida’s snake art, as well as Frida playing snake charmer with her esposo, who is dressed like a snake.]'' "Why’d it have to be snakes?" ''[Faints again]''
