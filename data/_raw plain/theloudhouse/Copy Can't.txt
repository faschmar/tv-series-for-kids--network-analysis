{{Transcript}}
''[Carl is using a tortilla chip as a paper football.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "If he makes the field goal, Carl Casagrande will go down as the most daring, most talented, most handsome,"<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Using his fingers as the goal.]'' "Any day now Carl."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Football player in history!"<br>
''[Carl takes the shot, and it lands on Hector's cheek, he licks it into his mouth.]''<br>
'''Hector, CJ, & Carl:''' "Goal!"<br>
''[The three go wild about it, until Rosa shoves a spoon into Carl's mouth.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Irate]'' "My chilaquiles are for eating."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[On video chat with Sid.]'' "So, did you get all the supplies for our big go cart race?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Yup, and I got us matching helmets too." ''[Picks up a stack of different sized helmets.]'' "I wasn't sure what size your head is, so I got some options."<br>
''[Just then, Rosa snatches the phone.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "No telefonos at breakfast, mija."<br>
''[Tosses it up to Sergio, who's wearing a police hat and making siren sounds.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Busted." ''[Flies off]'' "Coming through."<br>
''[He whizzes past Bobby, startling him, and making him spill hot sauce onto Maria's breakfast.]''<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Unaware, takes another bite. Her face turns red, she belches up fire, and fans her tongue.]'' "¡Oy! ¡Fuego!"<br>
''[Next to her, Carlitos copies her.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Awe, what a cute copy cat." ''[Takes a photo]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Carlitos, look at this."<br>
''[Carlota throws her spoon up and balances it on her nose, Carlitos does that too, everyone thinks it's cute.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Carlitos, copy this." ''[Takes two sticks, puts them in her mouth and pretends to be a walrus.]'' "I'm a walrus. See?" ''[Carlitos just stares at her.]'' "Don't you wanna copy me too Carlitos?"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Laughs]'' "''Denied''!"<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Stern]'' "Carl."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No, he's right, Carlitos copies everyone but me. Do you think it's because he doesn't like me?"<br>
'''Frida:''' "Oh, of course not, Carlitos is just a baby, and babies are finicky sometimes."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "He'll warm up to you, you just need to give him time. The average infant needs around six months before-"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Thanks Tío, but, I'd rather just get Carlitos to like me now."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne slams her fists on the table, this makes Carlitos cry.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Ronnie Anne, you should try taking him to the park."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "That's a great idea Tía Frida." ''[Takes Carlitos]'' "Come on Carlitos, let's get some fresh air."<br>
''[Just than, Maria belches up more fire, scalding Frida's face, she has nothing to say about it.]''<br>
'''Maria:''' "Sorry, too much hot sauce."
----
''[At the half-pipe.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Get ready Carlitos, I'm about to blow, your, mind." ''[Ronnie Anne does some cool tricks on the half-pipe. She passes by Carlitos, juggling.]'' "What do you think?" ''[And again with pigeons on her arms.]'' "Is your mind ''blown'' yet?" ''[Passes by in a handstand, and notices Carlitos not even paying attention.]'' "Carlitos?"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne stops her board. Just then, Sid walks up.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Hey Ronnie Anne, I added flames to our helmets. Hardcore right?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Thanks Sid. But can we do this later? I'm trying to get Carlitos to like me." ''[Jumps down]'' "I thought my cool skateboard tricks would win him over, but I'm not getting anywhere."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Hmm, have you tried doing things that babies think are cool?" ''[Gives Ronnie Anne the other helmet.]'' "Observe." ''[She goes over to Carlitos and does a gorilla impression, Carlitos laughs and copies her. Sid goes to Ronnie Anne and takes the helmet back.]'' "Now you try." ''[Ronnie Anne goes up to Carlitos and does a gorilla impression, but Carlitos just chews on his whale, turns, and sits down with his back to Ronnie Anne.]'' "Ouch, that's harsh. Well, I'm sure you'll get there. Now I'm gonna go add feathers to our helmets, nothing says hardcore like feathers." ''[Leaves]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Sighs, then gets an idea]'' "Ooh, I know, no one can resist a compliment." ''[Lies down]'' "Who's the most handsome baby around? You are." ''[Carlitos, is still chewing his whale, and angrily spits it in Ronnie Anne's face.]'' "Ah!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne wipes the spit out of her eyes. Carlota walks up.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "¿Que haces Ronnie Anne?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I'm trying to win Carlitos over with compliments." ''[Carlitos starts picking his nose.]'' "Excellent digging technique, bet you have some nice mocos in there."<br>
'''Carlota:''' "No, no, Ronnie Anne, you are way too desperate for his attention. If you want someone to like you, the key is to act ''un'' interested. Take Diego for example." ''[Points right behind her, where Diego is trembling under the weight of a huge heart-shaped bouquet of flowers with an arrangement in the center made to look like Carlota's face.]'' "I've been ignoring him for the past forty-five minutes."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Alright, I'll try it." ''[Carlitos is making his whale ride the skateboard, Ronnie Anne walks up to him and pretends to ignore him.]'' "Is it working? Does he like me now?"<br>
''[Carlitos seems more interested in the whale.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Just wait, he'll come around, they always do." ''[Carlitos rides the skateboard offscreen, suddenly traffic noises can be heard; concerned.]'' "Okay, it's not working." ''[The girls run after Carlitos.]'' "Grab him. Grab him!"
----
''[At the mercado, Carl and Sergio are at the counter, Ronnie Anne walk in holding Carlitos, who's hitting her on the head with the whale.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hey Ronnie Anne. So, Carlitos still doesn't like you, huh?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No, no, no, we're doing great."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Listen, the key to any good family relationship is bribery, watch and learn." ''[To Sergio]'' "Hey Sergio, who's your favorite Casagrande?<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Me, no contest" ''[Carl holds out a cracker. Sergio squawks.]'' "Carl's a close second." ''[Carl takes out a whole box of crackers. Sergio squawks.]'' "Carl for the win."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[To Ronnie Anne]'' "Works every time."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Okay, let me try." ''[Grabs some Chicharrones]'' "Carlitos, want some chicharrones from your favorite prima Ronnie Anne?"<br>
''[Carlitos is oohed by them and drops his whale, but then he smacks the chicharrones from Ronnie Anne's hand and laughs.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Wow, that's cold."<br>
''[Carlitos blows raspberries at Ronnie Anne.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Having had enough]'' "Fine! I guess you'll just never like me." ''[Ronnie Anne kicks the whale, it bounces off Sergio, and knocks a piñata onto Ronnie Anne's head.]'' "Ow."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne takes the piñata off her head and spits the candy out of her lungs.]''<br>
'''Carlitos:''' "Ow."<br>
''[Carlitos copies Ronnie Anne using a paper bag.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Gasps]'' "YES! HE COPIED ME! HE LIKES ME!" ''[Does a victory dance]'' "Oh yeah, Oh!"<br>
''[Slips on the chicharrones, Carlitos copies and the two laugh.]''
----
''[Upstairs, Ronnie Anne excitedly enters the apartment, holding Carlitos.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Guys, Carlitos finally mimicked me." ''[Everyone cheers]'' "Guess he likes me after all." ''[Fist bumps him]'' "Isn't that right little dude?"<br>
'''Carlitos:''' ''[Returns the fist bump.]'' "Ow."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "¿Que he?"<br>
'''Frida:''' "Ow?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "He thinks my name is Ow, but it still counts. He likes me." ''[Holds up the goats and goes to the kitchen.]'' "Time for a victory snack."<br>
''[Carlitos follows her, also holding up the goats.]''<br>
'''Carlitos:''' "Time for victory snack!"<br>
''[In the kitchen, Ronnie Anne eats a sandwich, Carlitos follows her, when Frida comes to him.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Time for your bottle Cariño."<br>
'''Carlitos:''' ''[Clings to Ronnie Anne.]'' "Ow."<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Laughs]'' "Seems like this little copy cat idolizes his prima now, he wants you to feed him." ''[Gives Ronnie Anne the bottle.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Really? Me? Nice." ''[Feeds Carlitos]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Oh, when Carlitos is done with his bottle, I can give him a bath."<br>
'''Carlitos:''' "Ow! Wa wa Ow!"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Well, maybe you should do it, he doesn't seem to want to let go of you."<br>
''[Carlitos giggles]''
----
''[Later that night, Ronnie Anne is sound asleep, when suddenly a crying Carlitos is brought into her room.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Sorry, he was asking for Ow."<br>
''[Gives Carlitos to Ronnie Anne, Carlitos smiles, and Carlos walks out.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Uh, he really, really, likes his prima, it's almost like he's forgotten all about his mama." ''[Starts to get emotional and walks out, then takes a photo and starts crying. Carlitos starts saying "Ow" nonstop.]''
----
'''A FEW DAYS LATER'''<br>
''[Carlitos is outside Ronnie Anne's bedroom door, still saying "Ow", Ronnie Anne is wrapped in her blanket rocking back and forth. Sid enters the window.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Hey buddy, if you thought our helmets were cool before, just wait." ''[Hits a remote button, and a unicorn horn pops out.]'' "We're really gonna wow everyone at the big race today." ''[Carlitos is still trying to get into the room.]'' "Ronnie Anne, did you get a new cat recently?"<br>
''[Sid heads for the door.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Sid wait, don't open the-"
''[Sid opens the door and Carlitos blasts right past her and onto Ronnie Anne's head.]''<br>
'''Carlitos:''' ''[Laughs]'' "Hi Ow."<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Seeing the state Ronnie Anne's in.]'' "Woah, when's the last time you slept?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "It's been days, my plan to make Carlitos like me worked too well, he won't even go to Tía Frida or Tío Carlos anymore. Sorry, but I can't drive the go-cart with you today Sid, there's no way that Carlitos will let me out of his sight."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Awe, that's okay, too bad we don't have a Ronnie Anne clone."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Gets an idea]'' "Hey, that gives me an idea. Sid, I'm gonna need your help."
----
''[In the mercado, Bobby is dressed like Ronnie Anne, Sid tightens the hood.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "There, that'll care of the facial hair problem." ''[Jumps off her step ladder, with a roll of duct tape.]'' "And now for the belly hair problem." ''[Unrolls some tape]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Wait, what?" ''[Ripping sound, Bobby screams and looks at his bellybutton.]'' "I used to have an innie." ''[Passes out]''
----
''[Later, Ronnie Anne enters the mercado, followed by Carlitos.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Carlitos look, a three eyed camel."<br>
''[Carlitos looks, Ronnie Anne dives behind the counter, and Bobby takes her place, Carlitos looks back.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[In a high voice]'' "Sorry, I must have imagined it."<br>
''[Carlitos squints, Bobby and Sid awkwardly laugh, Carlitos walks up to Bobby.]''<br>
'''Carlitos:''' "Ow."<br>
''[Hugs what he thinks is Ronnie Anne, Bobby picks him up while the real Ronnie Anne and Sid crawl out.]''<br>
----
''[At the racetrack, Ronnie Anne and Sid pull up their go-cart.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Let's do this, wait, our horns." ''[They press their remotes, and unicorn horns come out of there helmets. Back at the mercado, Bobby and Carlitos are watching Adios Ana Adios, and playing peek-a-boo.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Covering his eyes]'' "Where is Carlitos?"<br>
''[Opens his eyes and the two of them laugh. Suddenly the TV gets preempted, by the news report of the go-cart race, Carlitos watches.]''<br>
'''News Correspondent:''' "I'm here at the Great Lakes City annual go-cart race, with two of it's youngest competitors; Sid Chang and Ronnie Anne Santiago. Girls, what's your favorite part of racing?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Competing with my best friend."<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Grabs the mic]'' "Winning at all costs." ''[Realizes]'' "Sorry, it's the helmet talking."<br>
'''Carlitos:''' "Ow?"''[Looks at Bobby]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Nervously laughs]'' "No, no, no, I'm Ronnie Anne. Really." ''[But Carlitos isn't fooled anymore, so he jumps Bobby, who starts using his real voice.]'' "No, not the duct tape."<br>
''[Bobby ends up on the floor wrapped in duct tape.]''<br>
'''Carlitos:''' "Ow."<br>
''[Carlitos, riding Lalo like a horse, puts on a grapefruit helmet, holds his whale, like a sword and lets out a battle cry. Lalo sets off, trampling Bobby, and out the door. Bobby hops after them.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Wait, okay come back." ''[Falls]''<br>
''[At the race track.]''<br>
'''Race Track Announcer:''' "Racers, on your marks, get set, go!"<br>
''[The race starts, and the carts take off.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Look at us, we're winning."<br>
'''Carlitos:''' ''[From a distance]'' "Ow! Ow!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Did you hear something?"<br>
''[Lalo and Carlitos catch up to them.]''<br>
'''Carlitos:''' "Hi, Ow, Ow."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Carlitos? How did you get here?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Also catches up to them.]'' "Sorry, that was my bad." ''[Falls down again]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Sid, take the wheel. Carlitos, it's dangerous out here, take my hand."<br>
'''Carlitos:''' ''[Puts his hand out]'' "Ow."<br>
''[The two try to grab each other's hands.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I can't reach him. Sid, get me closer." ''[Sid veers them closer, and Ronnie Anne grabs Carlitos.]'' "Gotcha."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne brings Carlitos into the cart, but the wheel snaps off.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Guess that's what happens when you spend all your time on helmets." ''[They start spinning out of control and crash into the barriers. Confetti pops out of the cart.]'' "That was for if we won." 
----
''[Back at the apartment, Carlos and Frida are looking at Carlitos' photo album.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Crying]'' "Remember, when he needed me?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Enters, dragging Carlitos by her foot.]'' "Tío Carlos, Tía Frida, I should have listened to you guys and waited for Carlitos to warm up to me instead of forcing it." ''[Puts Carlitos down]'' "I'm so happy Carlitos likes me now, but I got way more than I bargained for, I'll probably have to take him to college with me."<br>
'''Frida:''' "Heh, lucky you."<br>
''[At the moment, Carlitos looks at his stuffed pig, and throws the whale away.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Picks it up, confused]'' "Huh? I thought he loved that whale."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "When he plays with something for too long he gets sick of it."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "He does?"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne starts thinking, with Carlitos mimicking her.]''
----
''[Later, Carlitos is in the living room playing with the pig.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Grabs the pig]'' "Oh, I wanna play too." ''[Throws the pig and whale on the ground and makes chew toys out of them, Carlitos is revolted. Later, Carlitos is in the bathtub, playing with his boat.]'' "Let's play. Cannonball!"
''[Ronnie Anne cannonballs into the bathtub, splashing Carlitos all the way to the other side of the bathroom, Then that night, Carlitos can't sleep, because Ronnie Anne is in his crib, he covers his ears trying to block her snoring, but she starts rolling and presses him against the side of the crib.]''
----
''[The next morning, Carlitos is very tired, he sees Ronnie Anne and Carlos, and walks in their direction. Thinking her idea from last night may have not worked, Ronnie Anne gets nervous, until Carlitos walks past her and stops in front of his padre.]''<br>
'''Carlitos:''' ''[Reaches out to his dad]'' "Dadda."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Madre Mia," ''[picks Carlitos up]'' "it's happening. Frida!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Offers Carlitos a fist bump]'' "It's been fun, little dude."<br>
'''Carlitos:''' ''[Returns the fist bump]'' "Ronnie Anne."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I might not be Carlitos' favorite anymore, but at least he knows my real name."<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Offscreen]'' "Hey dudes," ''[Frida is shown to be dressed like Ronnie Anne, holding a skateboard.]'' "it's me, Ronnie Anne, just coming to play with Carlitos."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Tía Frida," ''[laughs]'' "it's okay, you don't have to do that."<br>
''[Laughs some more. Frida slowly skates by, floss dancing.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "I'm not Tía Frida, I'm Ronnie-"<br>
''[Frida starts flailing and falls over offscreen. Carlitos laughs, followed by Frida's marido, and sobrina.]''
