Bubble::: That's what they say.Looks like you've given up on things. I'm thinking about giving up on things myself. I've been lost in this wilderness a long time. Maybe you and me can wait here, to get eaten by a carnivore!

Bubble:::Yes, BMO?
BMO:::I-I don't think I'm ever going to get home again.
Bubble:::Don't cry. Sparkle is safe now and we did that. Thanks to us he's going to grow up and be anything he wants to be::: a strapping horse whisperer or a sexy hitman or whatever. And things are looking up for us, too; I saw some bugs up ahead who look pretty with it.

Jake::: Alright, hang on out there I'm comin' 
BMO::: Might be a minute. 
Bubble:::Um hey, so, BMO, since we have a little time, there is something I've been wanting to say.
BMO:::Hm?
Bubble:::I know I might never find my real home.
BMO::: No, Bubble, that's not true!
Bubble:::It is, I know it is, but it's... it's okay, because I realized something, all this time we've been together, BMO, I haven't felt lost, I felt at home.
Bubble:::And, it's you, BMO, I feel at home with.
Bubble:::So, I thought- I mean if you feel the same way, I thought we could get married. I-I mean... I'm not even sure what that means exactly but-
BMO:::I do! Oh, I do! I do!
Jake:::Hey, a bubble! Pop! 
BMO:::Bubble? Bubble?No! No no no, my Bubble! No!! 
Finn:::What's so funny?
Jake:::Oh, it's just BMO, he's pretending to be all messed up because his bubble got popped. 
Finn:::Oooh, heh haha, that is pretty funny.
BMO::: Oh, Bubble, I'm so sorry I brought you here! 
Bubble::: There, there, BMO, it's okay.
BMO::: Bubble? Is that you? I hear you in my head but I don't see you!
BMO:::Oh no, have I gone bananas?!
Bubble:::No, BMO, it's okay. You see, I'm finally free.
BMO:::I don't understand, Bubble.
Bubble:::No, not Bubble, Air. BMO I'm Air! I've been trapped in that bubble for so long I've forgotten who I am, but now I'm finally home.
BMO:::Yeaay!!Oh, b-but wait, now you don't need me... to feel... at home.
Bubble/Air:::Nooo, see that's what's so great. Now we can be together forever, BMO, every minute of every day. No more privacy, no more quiet, no more alone. Every room you ever go in, I'll already be there... waiting... forever and ever, until the end of time.
BMO:::Yaaaaay!!
