Lumpy Space Princess:::Hello?
Turtle Princess::: Hey, girl. Are you almost done with your book?

Lumpy Space Princess::: Finn! You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours!
Finn::: Oh. Yeah! Yeah, I have.

Finn:::Oh. Okay.
Lumpy Space Princess::: But you're the one who's hot, Finn!!
Finn::: Wow. Uh, thanks!
Lumpy Space Princess::: No... thank you.
