Marceline::: You guys wanna come party in the Nightosphere with me? I'm visiting with my dad and it's craaaazy boring.
Finn::: Whoa, wait a minute Marceline. Last time I saw your dad,I sliced open his soul sack. 
Marceline::: Oh no, he's totally chill now.
Finn::: Okay, but I'm keepin' an eye out for your old man in case he pulls any ' sneak attacks.
Marceline::: Don't be a wiener dog. Jake, you coming?
Jake:::Whoo! Yeah, baby!
Jake::: Alright. So, this is the Nightosphere, I guess.It looks banay-nays.Marceline says they got tons of crazy ways out here.Right, Marceline?Marceline!Marcy!!Hehehe.
Hunson Abadeer::: There you are, Marceline.Huh?Oh. Hello, dog. Hello, Finn. 
Finn::: Stay away from me, old man! 
Jake ::: Heheheh, nice one.
Hunson:::Now Finn, come on, there's no bad blood here!Come here, let's bury the hatchet!See how I'm not killing you?
Marceline:::Dad, stop!
Hunson:::Alright, I don't want to embarrass my little girl.So young lady, have you thought about my offer?
Jake:::What offer, Marceline's dad?
Hunson:::I want Marceline to take over the Nightosphere! Finally join the family business!
Marceline::: Business? Dad, what do you even do?
Hunson::: Oh!Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on...Check it out, sweetie.See how chaotic it is out there?How everyone's confused and frustrated? The Nightosphere is sustained by chaos!
Marceline::: Eh, I just don't see my self doing this biz'.
Hunson:::Okay. But I know you'll come around eventually. Or maybe you won't! I don't know. You're an independent woman!Well, I'm gonna take a nappy.Oh! I almost forgot! 
Marceline::: Dad!
Hunson::: Whoops! Hahaha!You should put this amulet on. It'll grant you wishes for, like, ponies. Or whatever kids like.
Marceline::: Dad, I'm a thousand years old.
Hunson::: Ha! Yes you are, sweetie.Daddy's little monster! 
Marceline:::Look, let's play something, okay?
Finn::: Okay!
Marceline:::I know you just wanna give your little girl the world, but Daddy I'm not just your little girl. I've got my own life, I've got my own plans, I hope you understand and like the way that I am because I want your respect and I want to be here. But I don't wanna rule the Nightosphere.Psssh. Whatever, Dad. [Puts the amulet on. A suit comes out of it and wraps itself around her. The phone is dropped and tentacles are seen. The phone is picked up and Marceline is seen looking like her father's monster's form in "It Came from the Nightosphere." The camera zooms out to show Finn approaching Marceline while she laughs evilly.
Finn::: Jake, grab the amulet! 
Jake::: Ow, my hippocampus!
Jake::: Well... that explains how we got amnesia-ed.But what about banana?
Finn::: Hey man, there's another video!
Demon::: We got mad prison overcrowding down here, fellas.So I gotta put you in the cage with the stuff. Sorry about that. But, you know, not really.Aw, my stomach! 
Finn::: That amulet's controlling Marceline! We have to go back and help her!We're gonna get back using that one portal spell we know!Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum! 
Jake:::Whoa, dude!She told us never to come back!
Finn::: Oh yeah. Oh!Jake! Can you turn into a gross demon?
Jake:::<nowiki> Mhmm. </nowiki>
Finn::: Grosser!
Jake:::What's your disguise?
Finn:::Paper plate mask, yo!
Jake::: Nice!
Finn::: Let's go! 
Marceline::: Who's next? Who's next? 
Weird Punishment Demon::: Uh... me, my lord "Aberdeer."
Marceline::: What do you desire, cowering spec? Pain? Pleasure? Or... weird punishment?
Weird Punishment Demon::: Uh... pleasure.
Marceline::: No, weird punishment!And what do you desire? P, P, or WP?
Big Demon::: I... pain?
Marceline::: Okay. 
Big Demon::: Aw.
Marceline::: Come on, come on, next!
Ab Demon::: Uh... I'm just gonna go.
Marceline::: You sure, dude? Don't you want abs?
Ab Demon::: Yeah, gimme abs! 
Finn::: I think we can charge up there and rip the amulet off her neck. 
Line Demon::: Hey! What're you guys doin'?! You can't run up to the front of the line! These good people have been waiting forever! Shame on you both! Everybody, shame them!Boo, sir! I "boo" what you're doing! Step back!Back!You will not cut the line!Again!You stay back here! And wait your turn like the rest of us!Under... stand?!

Demon in line::: Sorry dude, you got outta line. I-
Line Demon::: Dang it! 
Marceline::: Who are you?
Finn::: Ahh! Don't kill us Marceline!
Jake::: It's us! Finn and Jake!
Finn:::Your friends, remember?
Marceline::: Eh. 
Jake and Finn::: Oh Grod!
Finn::: Run!Marceline...
Finn::: What are you doing?
Hunson::: Just grabbing a midnight snack. 
Finn::: It's Marceline! That's her out there!
Hunson::: I know!Isn't it fantastic?
Finn:::No! We have to save 'er!
Hunson:::Save her?
Finn::: From the amulet!
Hunson::: But this is what I've always wanted! My girl, following in her daddy's footsteps.
Finn::: But that's not what she wants!
Hunson::: That's balderdash, baby. The wearer of the amulet is filled with chaotic evil! Which is how I grew up. So... 
Finn::: Maybe we can get these dudes to help us! 
Jake::: These guys won't help you. They're all complacent sheeple. 
Finn::: Wait, that's it! We're gonna freestyle a political rap to get these guys to rise out of their systemized demon apathy.
Jake:::Okay... 
Demon in crowd::: I never thought of it that way before!
Demon in crowd #2::: The system is broke, yo!
Finn::: Marceline! 
Jake::: Aw, sick!
Finn:::Jake! The tree house!
Jake::: Ahhhh! I'm too freaked out to move, Finn! These demons are nibbling my legs! 
Finn:::Jake! Take her! 
Jake::: No, Finn! You'll be filled with chaotic evil!
Finn::: Marceline...No one...leaves the Nightosphere!
Hunson:::Marceline! Um, I wonder what happened to him! Kids these days... am I right?
Jake::: Dude... seriously.
Marceline::: Dad, you tricked me.Dad, that sucks!
Hunson::: I know, I'm sorry. But I thought you'd want to, want to make your old man proud and you know... take over the Nightosphere.
Marceline::: Yeah, I want you to be proud. I want you to be proud of me!
Hunson::: No, I didn't mean... Baby, of course I'm proud of you.
Marceline::: Dad...
Hunson::: And your friends? They're alright! That political rap?Pretty great!
Marceline::: Okay, okay, I gotta go now, Dad.Woof. What a nightmare. Man, Finn, my dad actually likes you. I don't wanna hang out with you anymore.Finn?
