Jake:::Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Lady Rainicorn:::안녕. ("Hello.")
Jake:::Hey bear dude, sorry to drop in like that.
Jemraine:::Oh, hey... brother.
Jake:::Whoa. Jermaine?! We must be dreaming at the same time again.
Jermaine:::Yeah.
Jake:::I was just hanging out with a couple of ladies outside... or a couple of the same lady. Then bam! Sky-boxed!
Jermaine:::Ugh. Jake, I'm here to work. I got to keep everything where it should be. So, uh... so how are you and Finn doing?
Jermaine:::Whoop! Ah!
Jermaine:::Uh...Epsilon, eucradies, dernesto... 
Jake:::Jermaine? You okay, man?
Jermaine:::No, no, I'm--I'm fine. Everything's fine.
Jake:::Oh.
Jermaine::: epsilon, eucradies, dernesto...
Jake:::Hey, listen, um, maybe we should get together in theawake world? You know, meet in meat-space?
Jermaine:::Uh, yeah. Sounds great. See you later.
Jake:::In the dream, Jermaine was wearing a bear suit. I wonder what that symbolizes. Maybe it means Jermaine needs us to visit.
BMO:::Workout time!
Jake:::You want the can or the cup? 
Finn:::I like the can. 
Jake::: Hmm. I'd hate it if my kids didn't ever see each other...Or if Viola shoved Jake Jr. down a dream hole.
Finn:::I don't know. Jermaine's always been kind of a dream hole.
BMO:::Whoa.
Jake:::We're all getting older. We should go see him now, or we might regret it.
Finn:::Eh. It's not a great time just this minute.Trying to figure this deal out.
BMO:::Woah!
Finn::: Okay. Let's go see Jermaine.
Finn:::There's a lot more demons here than I remember.
Jake:::Huh. Yeah. The only constant is change, bro.
Shadow Demon 1:::I want my yo-yo!
Finn:::Yo, yo! That's rude, dude!
Shadow Demon 2:::Give me my cup!
Finn:::Huh?
Shadow Demon 2:::Bring me my cup, or I'll skull-cup you!
Jake:::Yipe!
Finn:::Jake!
Finn:::Woah!
Jermaine:::Oh, you guys really came. Quick, get behind the salt barrier!
Jermaine:::They can't cross the circle. It's made from Dad's old shaman-blessed, sage-infused salt.
Shadow Demon 2:::Return my cup! Return my cup-- Stop poking me!
Jermaine:::Knock it off, guys. Just get in the house.
Jermaine:::You guys can chill here 'till morning, when the demons thin out a little.
Finn::: Whoo!
Jermaine:::Oh, Finn--Oh no! Instant regret!
Finn:::Whoo! My house, my house!
Jermaine::: Instant regret!
Finn:::Whoo! Remember, Jermaine? We did this when we wanted to make room for dessert!
Jermaine:::I don't care about that memory!
Finn:::What?
Finn:::Whoa--Ohh! Dang, my back.
Jermaine:::Come on! This ain't the treehouse, man! I got systems!
Jake:::Hey Jermaine, this thing is rad--Whoa!
Jermaine:::Okay, no more sleepover!
Finn:::Oh no! Don't--don't kick us out!
Jermaine:::Go do your Gaucho Marx slapstick with them goofballs in the woods. I got a responsibility to all this booty in here--Staves, medallions, cups, goblets,dormant jinn, grimoires, hard-drives... All this random valuable booty, okay?
Jermaine:::Oh, shoot.
Jermaine:::I gotta run this beast.
Jermaine:::Open, ya sissy!
Jermaine:::Yeah, flip the tape, I know.
Jermaine:::"Good times." Right.
Booboo Sousa:::Hey! I'm Booboo Sousa! You want to be friends?
Jermaine:::We've been friends, Booboo.
Bryce:::You're slippin', Jerm.
Jermaine:::No I'm not.
Bryce:::You're gonna miss that alarm one day, and I'm gonna eat you from the bottom up,so you can watch me while I eat you. Then, in my triumph, I will retrieve the poster your dad stole from me.
Jermaine:::Bryce, I put the poster right there.You're still mad about that?
Bryce:::How dare you use tacks on my poster! You're gonna get it, man!
Jermaine:::You know, Bryce, I would've let you and your poster go years ago if you'd stop it with all that "from the bottom up" talk.
Bryce:::You would?
Jermaine:::Yeah, man! I don't want to flip that tape all day! That's you and Joshua beef 'cause you wouldn't stop breaking in for that poster.
Bryce:::Well, come on man, let's be bros!
Jermaine:::No way, you psycho. I ain't never gonna trust you after all that stuff you said. 
Bryce:::I'm gonna taste that dog carne asada, you hear?!
Jermaine:::You're never gonna taste my carne asada, Bryce.
Finn::: Dude, you can't live like this!
Jake::: Yeah, you got a plan B for Bryce, or what?
Jermaine:::I don't need a plan B. I'm responsible. You guys want fried rice or something? I can make fried rice.
Jake:::No, Jermaine, we'll make you fried rice.
Jermaine:::Okay, just don't break any more junk. That's our parents' valuable artifacts, you knuckleheads.
Bryce:::I'm gonna white-knuckle you, Jermaine! You'll see!
Jake:::Whoo-hoo! I've never even made fried rice before!Get the plates.
Finn::: Whoosh!
Jake::: Du-u-ump!Pre-sen-tation. 
Jermaine:::Good plating. Sorry I only have one chair.
Jake:::To brothers! 
All:::To brothers! 
Finn:::It doesn't have to be weird, you guys!
Jermaine::: What's that sound? It sounds like howling.
Jake:::Let's eat!
Jermaine:::Dang, dude, this fried rice destroys. How'd you get all this flavor?
Jake:::Sesame oil and salt. Salt is one of the five taste sensations.
Finn::: Sweet, sour, bitter, umami and salty.
Jermaine:::I guess I'm just used to bitter.That's weird. I haven't had salt in like five years. Hold on...
Jermaine:::Epsilon, eucradies, dernesto, quillduct...Uh, where'd you get the salt from, Jake?
Jake:::I snooched a little from outside. Why?
Shadow Demon 2:::Get my cup, Ariel! Please, dude!
Ariel:::You get it! I need my DAT tapes.
Shadow Demon 2:::I can't fit through that hole Ariel! Aaaah!
Finn and Jake:::Got it!
Jermaine::: That sword's too unweildy, man.
Jake:::But it'll look decent when I triple combo this bozo with this thing, right?
Finn:::Like how?
Jake:::Like this, bro! 
Jake:::Aah! Oof!
Ariel:::Boo, stupid!
Ariel:::Where's my DAT tapes?!
Jermaine:::Epsilon, eudradies, epilindus...
Jake:::Oof! Why is this thing so dense?
Jermaine:::I got your tapes over here!
Ariel:::Give me my ta--Oof! Aah!
Jake:::I got him! Hup!
Jake:::Sha-boom! Woah, watch it!
Jake:::Cut his arms, Finn!
Finn:::Okay!
Finn:::Woah!
Jake:::Wha--?
Ariel:::Aaaaah!
Shadow Demon 2:::My cup, Jermaine!
Shadow Demon 2:::Oof!
Shadow Demon 3:::You're a pain, Jermaine!
Shadow Demons::: Jermaine the pain! Jermaine the pain!
Jake::: Awesome, dude! We won!
Jermaine:::I didn't win!When do I win?! Special guys one and two win every day! Crackin' jokes, readin' foodie mags in your tree-town fun-house. Must be nice to be so special you can go off and find your own fancy ways! Meanwhile I gotta stay here and watch Dad's trashy booty 'cause I never stretched into the sky and farted on the wings of a falcon, I guess!
Jake:::Dude, I never farted on the wing of a falcon. 
Finn:::Bros!
Jake:::Chill, Jermaine.
Jermaine::: Think I don't want a cushy tree-house life?!I don't even get salt! Saaalt!Bark! Bark! Bark!Huh?
Jake:::Yeowch!
Jermaine:::I'm sick of bein' Daddy's watchdog.
Finn::: This must've been building up for a while.
Jake:::Woah!
Finn:::Wah!
Finn:::Hand fire.
Jermaine:::You got to be Dad's favorite! I got stuck with his mess!
Jake:::Come on. Dad didn't have a favorite. He just liked my fart jokes.
Jermaine:::I'm the fart joke!
Creature:::Shazbaz!Uh, no. Shazbaz!
Jake:::Ow. Dad loved us both.You could've left any time.
Jermaine::: I know!
Jake:::If you punch me again I'm gonna fart.
Jermaine:::Oh man. I've really built my own cage.
Finn:::Guys, guys, guys!
Finn:::This whole place is burning down!
Finn:::So if you're done being angry bonkers, let's work together!
Finn:::Jermaine? You gonna leave me hanging, bro?
Jermaine:::Let it burn.
Jake:::Huh?!
Finn::: But all of Dad's stuff!
Jermaine:::No... I think it's all right.
Finn:::The salt line got broken.Where'd all the d's go?
Jake::: Maybe with all their stuff gone they had no reason to stay.
Jermaine:::Oh, no! The tape!
Jermaine:::Open...!
Bryce:::I got my poster!
Jermaine:::Booboo Sousa...
Bryce:::I ate his stupid face off! It was sick.
Jermaine:::Ugh. Do you even know what you sound like when you talk like that?
Bryce:::I sound cool.
Jermaine:::If that's what you think.
Bryce:::That's what I know.
Bryce:::Dang. Has it always been so bright out here? Makes me wanna explode the sun and banish the Earth into darkness.
Jermaine:::See? You're doing it again!
