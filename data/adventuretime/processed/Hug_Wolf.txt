Finn::: The Tree of Blight.
Finn::: Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land.
Jake::: Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's.Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods.
Alpha Hug Wolf::: Huuugs!
Finn::: What the—?! Is this an extra butt?!Quick, Jake! Burn the tree!
Alpha Hug Wolf:::Huuuugs!Gonna hug you up, boy! I'm gonna snuggle you to pieces!
Jake::: Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over!
Finn::: No!Jake, hurry!
Jake::: Is he crushin' you, man?!
Finn:::No, he's just... hugging me gently!
Jake::: Oh...!When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Jake says, "Hello."
Jake::: Hey, buddy, you okay?
Finn::: Didn't even tell me its name...
Jake::: Wha..,?
Finn:::Oh, sweet! Ha-ha-ha!
Finn and Jake:::Hot to the touch!
Jake::: Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy?
Finn::: I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps.
Jake::: Hmm...You've got a fever, man.
Finn::: I feel hot. 
BMO::: Finn, you're hurting me.
Jake::: I think you need a good night's sleep.
Jake::: You feelin' better today?
Finn::: Yeah. I feel like a million clams.
Jake::: Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter?Litter for lunch! Mmm!
Cinnamon Bun::: Huh? Not again!
Finn::: What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun?
Cinnamon Bun::: Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night.
Finn::: Uh... I didn't hug you last night.
Cinnamon Bun::: Yes, you did! My love handles still hurt! You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze—a really strong one! 
Finn::: CB says I hugged 'im. Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya.Oh, Cinnamon Bun.What a crazy story, buddy.
Jake::: Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy.
Finn::: Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you?
Jake::: I'm just sayin' you were really clingy.
Finn:::But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun.
Jake::: No. I have a theory, ...but I don't like it.
Jake::: Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right?
Finn::: ...So...?
Jake::: Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is."Hug wolves—a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon."!
Finn::: Like last night!
Jake::: Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature.
Finn::: Well, how can I get uncursed?
Jake::: Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure.
Finn::: Uh... I'm scared, Jake... 
Jake::: No hugs!!
Finn::: I'm sorry!I feel hot! Rrrrr!!
Jake::: What's wrong, BMO?
BMO::: I am terrified of Finn.
Jake::: Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you.You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??
Finn::: I think so.
Jake::: I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??
Finn::: Yeah. I heard you. I said I think so.
Jake::: I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout.
Finn::: Oh. Okay. IS THIS GOOD?!?
Jake::: Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel?
Finn::: Prickly and painful.
Jake::: Good, good, you're doin' great!
Finn::: Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now?
Jake::: No, you can't hug anything.
Finn::: But that poor cactus! It... it... NEEDS ME! 
Jake::: Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain!
Finn:::I want to hug you, Jake! Close!
Jake::: Finn... say something to reassure me.
Finn::: I'LL HUG YOUR MOM!
BMO::: Jake! We need the silver baseball!
Finn::: Hrrugs!! HUGS FOR BUDDIES!

Finn::: Bring it in, guys!

Finn::: Huh? Huh?What... What happened? Jake... what happened to me last night?
Jake::: You hugged... everyone.
Finn::: NO!
Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone::: We're mad, but we're not gonna go down there.
Finn::: People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe, ...and because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon.
Candy Baby::: Why's Finn in the cage, Mama? Isn't hugs nice?
Candy Mother::: Oh, baby...
