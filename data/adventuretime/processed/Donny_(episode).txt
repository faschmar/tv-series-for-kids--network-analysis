Finn::: Safety!Patrol!
Jake::: Safety!Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety— Oh... Were we not wearing the uniforms?
Finn::: C'mon. Let's keep lookin' for hazards. Look out!
Jake::: What is it, dude?
Finn::: Shushers, man!Look there!
Jake::: Just looks like an ordinary little town, man.
Finn::: Yeah...Suspiciously ordinary. Oh! Little house people! Maybe it is just regular ordinary, not sinister ordinary—oh, no, wait... Grass ogre.
Donny::: Haha!Hey, chicken, you're travelin' egg-spress! 
Finn::: It's an obnoxious grass ogre.
Donny::: You get my joke, right?! Hahaha!
Barn House::: Careful, you oaf! Those chickens are rentals!Agh!
Donny:::We're havin' so much fun, huh?!
Jail House::: Drop that chicken!
Donny:::Huh?
Jail House::: You're under arrest!Good... Now get in your tiny cell... Oh, uh, oh!
Finn::: Hey, ogre! Stop hazing these cute little houses!
Jake::: Ya jerkball!
Donny::: My name is Donny, idiot!
Finn::: Sorry. I was just tryina' get your attention.
Donny::: What kinda houses are you supposed to be? A... stupid... uh... a dumb house?! Haha! Hey, what's with your jowl?! 
Jake::: Ow!
Donny::: Hahaha! I'm gonna mess with these housies some more.
Finn::: NEVER!!
Donny::: So you wanna wrestle, huh? 'Cause I know, like, this ninja move to get out of this lock instantly! Okay... Now, first I...Hey! You're doin' it wrong!!
Jake:::Whoa.
Finn::: You're doin' it wrong!
Donny::: Whaddaya mean?
Finn::: First, you roll your right shoulder forward...
Donny::: Like this?
Finn::: Yeah, but then I counter it by doin' this! 
Donny::: Hey!
Finn::: Um... You need to take a break?
Donny::: No... but if you need to, we can stop...Ya baby.
Jake::: Whoa, I zoned out there for a bit. Did you win?
Finn::: Nah. Just takin' five. Donny's pretty good.
Donny::: Yeah, well, you're okay, too.
Finn::: Thanks, man.
Donny::: ...For a complete idiot!
Finn::: Aww...
Jake::: Donald, quit all this jerky nonsense!Unless you wanna get gored by a forest prince!
Donny::: I was just kiddin' around, but then you took it too far! You guys are the real jerks! 
Jake::: Donny is one mixed-up dude.
Finn::: Nah. He's just rough-and-tumble, like me, but deep down, he's probably really sensitive, like me.
Jake::: You're a mixed-up dude, too!
Finn::: Hey, Donny!
Donny::: What?
Finn::: I was thinkin' that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd wanna hang out with a couple a' rascals like me and Jake!
Jake::: What?
Donny::: Muuuh... I don't know. Messin' with these housies is pretty fun. You got somethin' better?
Jake:::You sure this is a good idea?
Finn:::If you come to the Tree Fort, we got video games and apple juice!
Donny:::Really?!I mean... if it keeps you from cryin'...
Finn:::Donny's problem is that he's treated like an outsider, like me.
Jake::: You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts!
Finn::: I... am complicated.
Donny::: Uh... This fort isn't so great. Not as cool as the fort I'm gonna build.I call this chair!
Finn::: Hey, Donny, you should play Bug Battle.
Jake:::And hey, can you put on some pants?!
Donny::: You put on some pants!
Jake::: I have pants...spun from spiderwebs... by pixies.
Finn:::Okay. There's you, and here come the bugs.
Donny::: Huh?!
Finn::: Oh, yeah. Those guys'll get ya.
Donny:::Urgh!! This game cheats! 
Jake::: Not cool, dude.
Finn::: Have more apple juice. It always makes me feel better when I—Aaah! Donny! Quit being a jerk!
Donny::: What? What'd I do?
Jake::: Finn, I don't think this is gonna work.
BMO::: I am incapable of all emotion.... but you are making me chafed!!
Donny::: Everybody's gettin' mad at me for nothin'!
Finn::: You have to think about how your actions make other people feel.
Donny::: Ohh. Hmm. I don't understand at all.
Jake::: Ooh! Teach him that little empathy song I taught you!
Finn::: Okay, yeah!Empathy, empathy, put yourself in the place of me!Your turn!
Donny::: Uh... Empathy, empathy, put yourself... Ohh! So it's like, when I squeeze eggs outta chickens, I should let them squeeze eggs outta me, too!
Finn::: ...Um... kinda right.Someone needs our help! Jake, you stay here and try to fix him, while I deal with an unknown possibly deadly emergency! 
Jake::: Dude, trade me jobs.
Donny::: Jake! Someone broke your... um... entire living room!
Bank House::: Quick! Act abandoned!
Finn::: Hands off the housing market!BACKPACK!Werewolves. Much worse than ogres. 
Jail House::: Stop in the name of the law!
Finn::: Is there somewhere I can trap that thing?
Jail House::: Well, there was a zoo, but he moved back east. Course, there's always the old well.
Well::: I'm not old!
Finn::: Perfect!Slam-bam-in-a-can! Huh? Another werewolf?!? What's up with this town?!
Finn::: Mr. Bank! Are you alright?!
Bank House::: Oh, it's fine, it's fine. All my assets are insured. Pardon.I have to go spackle my cracks.
Finn:::Why is this town just getting worse and worse?
Wolf:::Yes! Why indeed!!
Finn:::Hey! What are you werewolves up to?!
Wolf::: We're not werewolves...We're Why-wolves.
Finn::: Uh... Why-wolves?
Why-wolf::: Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry.....AND... BLOODLUST!!
Finn::: What?!
Why-wolf:::Please. Save your questions until the end of the lecture.Our ecosystem. At the bottom level are the house people. Given the opportunity, we Why-wolves would easily wipe them out. However, Donny's presence is a natural deterrent. His jerkiness is so powerful that it produces a pungent gas—obnoxygen. To Why-wolves, it is a deadly poison. But since you've removed the jerk Donny, we will devour the houses, and our population will rapidly swell until we are, in turn, devoured by the Cosmic Owl. Such is the course of nature, but it'll be a pretty sweet ride up until that point.TONIGHT, WE FEAST ON THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS! 
Finn::: Oh, no! I have to get Donny back!
Finn:::Donny, you have to go right now, and stop the Why-wolves from—
Donny:::Ah! Master Finn has returned!
Finn::: What's it goin'?!
Donny::: Thanks to you, I shall never be jerky again!
Finn::: Oh, no... Oh, no. Oh, no, nonononononono! No! This is all wrong! We need jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen, and, and—
Donny::: Steady on, Finn. Perhaps you are dehydrated! It's as Jake taught me:::"8 ounces, 8 glasses, 8 days a week!"I'll fetch you some tap water.
Finn::: Are you wearing jeans now?!
Donny::: Surely!Gotta get pants! Go get your pants! Button, fly! I wrote that one myself. Perdoname. 
Finn::: But, but, but—
Jake::: Butt, butt, butt! Yeah, Donny! You're lookin' good in those jeans!
Finn::: What did you do?!
Jake::: Miraculous, isn't it? I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect.
Finn::: No! We messed up, Jake! The House People are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk!
Donny:::I have no intention of being a jerk again. Hmph.
Finn::: But the housies will be wiped out if you don't!
Donny::: It sounds tragic, but I'm turning over a new leaf! 
Finn::: Donny, you gotta go!
Donny::: Finn, "no" means, "no." I'm sure you'll respect my wishes.No! Stop! No!
Finn::: Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves!
Donny::: No! I'll use my musical messages to stop them!Let's see... I've got one on the ethics of laundry... Crosswalk-ery... Ooh! Here's a good one!
Finn::: Man! The town is getting creamed! By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny!!
Donny:::Comb your hair right! It's a good time! Sticky, sticky pomades, short back and sides!Why isn't anybody paying attention to my words?
Finn:::He sure is sensitive about his songs!It's cuz they think your songs are dumb!
Donny::: Wha?!
Jake:::What're you saying?! If you don't encourage his talent, he might revert back to jerk Do—OHHH, OHHH!HEY, DONNY! EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!!
Finn::: They all think you're a real jerk!
Donny::: But... but I've changed! Why would they say that?!Empathy, empathy, put your mind insi...
Why-wolf::: You're so pathetic! So comical!
Donny:::Rrrrr... Think I'm a jerk do they? I'm feelin'.. obnoxious!!HEY, YOU WHY-WOLVES ARE COOL! JUST KIDDING!HAHAHAHA!!
Why-wolf::: Obnoxygen cloud!! EGRESS!!
House People::: The town is saved!!
Donny::: Get offa' me, nerds!!
Finn::: You did it, Donny! You're a full-blown jerk again!
Donny::: What?! You're the jerk!! Housies! Ready to hear my new song?! It's about how Finn will betray you, just to save lives!
Finn:::I'm sorry, Donny.
Donny::: I'll never forgive you, Finn!!WAAAAAAH!!!
Jake:::C'mon. We can go stare wistfully at the lake.
Finn:::I'd... I'd like that. Very much.
Donny::: Hey! I love bein' a jerk! Thanks, Finn! Finn?Finn, you loser!I'll never... forget you!
