Finn:::What?!
Finn::: BMO, you got to let me dig this hole. It's important.
BMO:::A hole, you say?
Finn:::Yeah. We beat this evil wizard, see, and we stole his giant wand.
Jake:::<nowiki> Don't listen to him, BMO. </nowiki>I beat the wizard, so I'm making Finn dig the hole, even though I could do it in like two seconds. Heh, heh, heh.
BMO:::Rude!
Finn:::This wand is crazy powerful, right? It's a thought cannon. It makes anything that you think of turn real.
BMO:::Up, please.
Finn:::So it's too strong, so we're burying it for safety.
Jake:::I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd use that cannon and imagine a hole.
BMO:::Jake, remember what they say about absolutely power.
Jake:::I'm tired of your wisdom, BMO!Now watch and learn! Yeah, okay, my name's Jake, and I'm gonna take this magic thought cannon, and I'm gonna think, I want a hole to bury this thought cannon in, and bobble, bobble, Jake gets a hole in which a thought cannon may be buried!
Finn:::What if for a split second you think of something else?
Jake:::Nope, my brain's my hands!
Jake:::Whoops! Looks like I was thinking about a sandwich.Enjoy your labor! Heh, heh, heh.
BMO:::I used to wish I was you. Now I just wish you would dig faster.
Cuber:::<nowiki> What's this, friends?Could it be the aformabled thought cannon? "Bobble, bobble" as the dead might say. That's the power of graybles.</nowiki>
