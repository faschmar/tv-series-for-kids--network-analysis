BMO::: Hello?
Finn::: BMO?
Jake::: BMO?
Finn::: BMO, are you okay?
Jake::: What did you do?
BMO::: It wasn't me. I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing. 
Finn::: Come on BMO. We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs.
BMO::: No, no. I am fine. Really.Oh, yes. Okay. Please take me to get fixed. I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed. We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands, where I was born.
Finn:::The MO Factory?
BMO::: Yeah. I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there. Come on! There's no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose.
BMO:::Okay. Now straight down this place. Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here. The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened... or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven!
Finn:::Tears in the oven?But memories are real, real cruc'!
BMO::: Yeah, no fooling. Oh wait, there's more! It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory. Wait what? Oh, that's just great.
Jake::: Hey, hey. Don't worry buddy. We're Finn and Jake, remember? Or should I say...Finn and JMO!
BMO:::Wow!
Finn::: Hey BMO, check this out, too!Meet FMO.
BMO:::Finn, you're dumb- you're dumb- you're dumb- you're da man! This is gonna be a snap!
Jake::: Hello, there.
DMO::: Greetings, and welcome to MO Co. I'm DMO. Please state your business.
Jake::: Hey there, DMO. I am JMO.
Finn::: And I'm FMO!
DMO::: Greetings, JMO. FMO, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair?
Finn::: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, DMO. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones.
DMO::: Fantastic. Okay. Please get ready for your total personality wipe.
Finn::: Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for the... nostalgic purposes.
DMO::: Ah, yes. 47.3% of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz. Please step 100% on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour.
DMO::: Greetings. 
Finn::: Wup!
DMO::: We are now passing over the famous factory floor. Birthplace of each and every MO. Behold the gleaming machinery! Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation. From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO.
Jake::: But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place?
DMO::: I'm sorry. I'm just a tram MO. I'm not programmed to understand that question. Also, you're just a JMO. You're not programmed to ask that question.
Jake::: Uh, what question?
DMO::: That question- 
Jake::: I'm serious...
DMO::: Anyway, MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago. By Moseph Mastro Giovanni. A sad and gentle man. Beloved by only those he built to belove him. On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay.
BMO:::Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are!
Finn::: I know, I heard!
DMO::: What?! Are you crazy?! Get back here!
Jake::: Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'!
Finn::: None of these ports fit right! E, D, C, where's the B port?!
SMO 1::: Intruder spotted! Prepare to vaporize! Vaporize!
SMO 1::: Cease fire! No intruder spotted. Vaporization complete.
SMO 2::: Um, but what if they slipped past us, sir? In all the smoke?
SMO 1::: Allllright, everyone. About face.Does anyone see the intruders now?Like I said, vaporization complete. Now let's head back to base. It's donut o' clock.
SMO 3::: Man, how about those goofs? Tryin' to mess with our drivers?
SMO 4::: Yeah. You know the world these days. All goofs. 
SMO 1::: Hey! You toss me one of them 'nuts?Ah. Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs? Haven't seen SMO 5681 lately.
SMO 3:::Man, that goof.
SMO 1::: Yeah, I hate that goof.You ever notice goofs always askin' how you're doin'? What is that? Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
SMO 3::: Yeah, 100%.
SMO 1::: Oh! Hey, what are you doing over there by yourself?
SMO 5::: Uh, oh, I-- I'm sad.
SMO 1::: Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there.So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'?
Finn:::BMO, how are you doing?
BMO::: Get me close to that guy's port. I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is! 
Jake::: Ah, we gotta hustle!
SMO 1:::Yeah, pretty good, I guess. I prefer something yeastier. The wife is always giving me grief about that. But I mean, what am I, decent?
SMO 4::: Hey, what are you two goofs doin'? Goofing?
Jake::: Dang, man, how deep does this place go?
Finn::: Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.
Finn::: Psych! 
SMO 3::: Hey, woah!
Finn::: Down that grate!
DMO::: Hey! Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000%!Get off of my tram!
Jake::: Cram your tram!Womp!
Finn::: Hang in there, BMO!
Finn::: Hey, Jake! Can this thing go any fast-
Finn::: Woah! Shoot, it's the fuzz!
DMO::: Hit 'em again!
Finn::: Holy-
Jake::: Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?!
Finn::: Uh, turn right!
Finn::: Dog it, they're still behind us! 
Finn::: Turn left!
Finn::: Turn Corkscrew!
Finn::: Now go down!
Finn::: There's a driver port!
Finn::: Too spicy.
Jake::: My bod!
SMO 6::: Non-MOs are forbidden in this facility!
BMO:::I am not non-MO.
BMO:::I am BMO!
SMO 6:::BMO.
Moe::: BMO? Did I hear BMO?
Jake::: Wait, what's up?
Moe::: Hey, I'm Moe!Don't worry! My legs don't work!
Finn::: You're Moe?! Wait, are you human, too?
Moe::: My skin is human!
Jake::: Dude, how old are you?!
Moe::: Hey, come on, now!It is BMO! Looks like there's some software problems!Hmm.
Finn::: So...you made BMO?
Jake:::Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you?
Moe::: Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son.Oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's sad.I sent BMO off into the world alone.Hoping to find a family home. And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.
Finn::: Aw.
Moe::: Oh, there's that back-up driver disk!Thank you.That oughta done it. I must've built what, like, a million MOs. But BMO is very, very special. I built BMO to understand fun. And how to play.You see, I made BMO to be more. 
BMO::: Ooh! Are you my grandpoop?
Moe::: Nah, I'm just your poop.
Jake::: Wait, did you say you built a million robots?
Finn::: Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks!
Moe::: Ah, those were just the surface jerks.Up, please.Kid, come over here.BMO, say hello to your family.
BMO::: Hello, family.
MOs::: Hi, BMO!
