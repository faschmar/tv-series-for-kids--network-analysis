Cutie's first head::: You think we're so cute, when actually... we're the opposite of that!! 
Jake::: Hold 'im!
Finn::: Oh, gross. 
Jake::: Well?! Do you believe me now, Finn?!
Finn::: I... I don't know what to believe anymore.
Jake::: Well, that's close enough. Let's start settin' up some barricades!
Jake::: There's gotta be a thousand of 'em!
Finn::: Wait. Jake, look.
Jake:::These guys aren't a threat to anyone.
Finn::: These guys are a threat to themselves.
Finn::: Oh, hey, it's what's-his-face!
Cute King:::<nowiki> No... My men! Quickly, men! Pick yourselves up before the enemy sees!Come on, now. That's it. Easy does it.Bravest warriors!

Jake::: Wanna just smash 'em all?
Finn::: What?! No, man, look. These guys aren't gonna quit until they win or die, ...and they're not gonna win, so what if we let 'em win, just this once?
Jake::: What?! And mess up my stats?!
Finn::: No. We'd be winning by helping them to win. That's a win!And then they'll be happy and leave us alone.
Jake:::Alright.
Finn::: Yessss! Now, let's rally an army so we can look intimidating.
Jake::: Who're we gonna call?
Finn::: All of our friends.
Finn::: My army of friends! Today, we will lose this battle, but we will also win it!When the enemy charges, crumble like a cookie. When you feel their puny punches, fade like a flower, and writhe in your own blood!
BMO::: But, but... how are we to bleed if none of this is real?
Finn::: With faith, m'lady... and ketchup!
Jake::: Ketchup is delicious and deceiving!
Finn::: And hey, guys... Let's keep the acting subtle. Less is more.
Lumpy Space Princess::: No way. First, I'm gonna fall in love with one of those little guys, and then I'm gonna fall out of love, and then, I'm gonna totally fake-die of a fake heart attack!"OH! MY HEART! MY HEART HURTS BECAUSE I FELL OUT OF LOVE! AND NOW I HAVE TO DIE! OOOOHHHHH!!!"
Finn::: Get ready, y'all. Together, we fall!
Lumpy Space Princess::: Not yet, Cinnamon Bun!
Cute King::: YAAAAH!

Cute King::: No...This is ketchup?!
Jake:::Tastes better than blood. Or does it? Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup?
Finn::: Jake. Look. 
Jake::: Aw, nuts.
Finn::: Cute King, wait up.
Jake:::We wanna apologize for being fakers.
Finn::: We did it to protect you from yourselves.
Cute King::: It doesn't matter now. No one will ever fear our strength.
Finn::: But strength isn't your strength. Adorable cuteness is!
Cute King::: Can I use it to control others?
Finn::: Um... yeah, sure! Just be righteous about it.
Cute King::: Show me where to start.
Ice King::: Huh? Who could that be? 
Cute King::: I command you to make me a sandwich!
Ice King::: What?! No one commands the Ice King to make no sandwich!
Cute King:::What about now?
Ice King:::Okay.
