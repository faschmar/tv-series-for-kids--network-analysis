Jake::: You guys are getting big! Okay!Excuse me. Mom's manual suggests that I read you guys a story.This was your daddy's favorite book when he was cute like you! 
Jake::: This is a lot darker than I remember! Um, gimme a sec.Is this appropriate for babies?
Holo-Margaret:::Get that book out of here!
Jake::: Yeah, okay. Sorry sweeties, Mom's manual says no. 
Lady::: 자기야, 애들 데리고 나가서 바람좀 쐬고 오지 그래? ("Hey honey, why don't you go outside and have some fresh air with the kids?")
Jake::: Take 'em out for fresh air huh?There m- there might be a giant fox out there.Or some-some other predator.Hey!This's not for babies! 
Mr. Fox:::Hey, free book.
Mr. Fox::: Hey! Hey everybody look! Look at this book I found about eating babies!They just sit there while you eat them. 
Fox #1::: Whoa! Eatin' babies.
Fox #2::: Why haven't we been eating babies this whole time? 
Mr. Fox::: I don't know, but I'm going to go eat one right now. 
Jake::: Okay everyone, your mom wanted me to take y'all out side.Ah ah ah, be careful.No Charlie, no. Too much germs, you know?Everybody just stick together and don't do anything and we can all take a nap.

Jake:::Hey Lady. These puppies are really wearing me out, you know? I can hardly keep my eyes open.
Lady::: 제이크, 자기 혼자 난리치는 거야. 우리 애들 걱정 안 해도 돼. 자기가 너무 과잉보호라니까. ("Jake, you're getting obsessed just all by yourself. Our kids have nothing to worry about. You're being overprotective.")
Jake::: No, no it's- it's all in the manual you see- it's- it-it's got a fe- 
Lady::: 아이야이야. 필요 없을 때만 난리라니까. ("Ai yai yai! He makes a fuss whenever it's not necessary.")
Fox #3:::Is that a baby? It doesn't look right. Why's he so sweaty. And hairy.
Mr. Fox::: Look, fellas, there's never gonna be a perfect baby. Times like this ya just gotta dive right in. 
Lady::: Goochy goochy goo!아, 얘들아, 가서 아빠 좀 도와드려라.
Jake::: What the- What are you doing?! Let me go!Hold on, hold on a minute. Just- just lemme- Y'all better watch out!Puppies?! What are you doing?! Go back inside! The manual's gonna flip!
Jake Jr.:::Dad! The manual's a buncha junk! Just give us a chance.
Jake::: Jake Jr.! You said your first words! "The manual's a buncha junk!" ... The manual's a buncha junk? Hmm. 
Flashback Margaret::: Stay back Jakey, my manual says it's too dangerous. 
Flashback Jake::: Mom. Your manual's a buncha junk! Look what I can do!

Pups::: 수학! ("Mathematical!")아빠 몸체이동! [Move Dad into body!")
Jake:::Whoa! What the-
Pups::: 무지개 뱅! ("Rainbow Bang!")프리즘 TBA 작동! ("Initiate prism cyclone!") 
Jake Jr.:::Ya see, dad? We flippin' crushed it. Crushed it!
Jake::: You did! I'm super proud y'all and I'm duper sorry too.I've been tryin' to make you know about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.
Lady:::애기들아! 참 잘했어! 너네 정말 대단했어! ("Well done, babies! You were awesome!")
Jake::: Yup! I've been tryin' to make them about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.
Jake::: Hey guys. I'm back. 
Finn:::Is everything okay?
BMO::: Did you ruin it?
Jake::: Nah, nah, it's cool. It turns out the pups can pretty much take care of themselves. They don't really need me around.
Finn::: Oh.
Jake::: Yeah. I guess rainicorns age really fast. They're basically like older than me already. Kil Whan has a beard now!
Finn::: Oh!
Jake::: Ah, it's okay! I got a slammin' family right here too!Plus all my stuff is here.
