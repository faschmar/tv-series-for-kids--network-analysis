Jake::: You want some more eggs, BMO?
BMO::: Yes, please.
Jake:::How 'bout you, Finny? Need a refill?
Finn::: I'm pretty full, man... but lemme see if I can... rearrange.Nope. Can't do it.
Jake::: I don't know if stomachs work like that, dude.
Finn::: Sometimes it helps.
Jake::: Can't argue with that!Ahh...
Finn:::Ahh...
BMO:::Ahh...
Jake:::Hello? Lady, it's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. Alright, I love you, too. Bye. 
Finn::: Lady Rainicorn again?
Jake::: Yeah, man. She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today. She thinks they're gonna freak out.
Finn::: Um... maybe give her parents some treasure?
Jake::: No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, smooth them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous! It's perfect! I'll just send them a quick Prism-gram.Mm-hmm. 
Finn::: What's it say?
Jake::: Hold on. It's still converting the light waves into brain waves.Ahh... They're into it, dude!
Finn::: Sweet! Let's go powder our noses!
Finn::: Why's Lady so nervous, anyway?
Jake::: Well... she didn't really say, but it might have somethin' to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars.
Finn::: There were wars between rainicorns and dogs?
Jake::: Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension... but Lady and I are cool.
Finn::: Dude! Her parents are probably all full of dog-hatred from the war-times! They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid Lady from ever hanging out with you again!
Jake::: ...Nah. That could never happen.
Finn::: You didn't think this through enough... IT COULD HAPPEN!!
Jake::: AAAH! I'M A MORON!
Finn::: Don't worry. I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz. Homies help homies. Always.
Jake::: I'm ready to hear your plan, homie.
Finn::: Haha, yeah! This plan is perfect!
Jake::: You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so sure, man.
Finn::: Come ooonnn. Trust me, homie.
Jake:::No, no, no, new plan. First, we're gonna clean this place up, and then—Huh?!
Ethel::: Jake?
Jake::: AAAAH...LET'S HIDE AND BURN THE HOUSE DOWN!
Bob:::Hello? 
Jake::: 안녕하세요. ("Hello.")
Ethel::: Jake, is that you?
Jake::: Uh-huh.
Ethel::: Are you going to let us in?
Jake::: Y-yeeeaaah... 
Ethel::: AAAAAAHHHH!!!
Jake::: I can explain!! I can explain!!
Ethel::: OOOHHHHH, he's so handsome! Oh, Bob, our daughter's finally found a handsome rainicorn to love!
Jake::: You think I'm a rainicorn?
Bob::: I think we can spot a member of our own species, Jake. We're not blind.
Ethel::: Well, we are a little blind.
Bob::: Yes, I guess we are a little blind.
Jake::: Uh, well, hey! Come on in! It's awesome to finally meet you both!
Ethel::: Your house is very colorful. I like that!
Finn:::Haha! The plan is working, homie!
Bob::: Jake, what is that thing that's talking?
Jake::: Uh... that's um...
Finn::: I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate! Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance! 
Bob::: Jake, please ask your goblin butler to stop insulting my heritage!
Jake::: Uh... y-yes!Get outta here, goblin! Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks!
Finn::: But—
Jake:::Come on, homie, help me!
Finn:::Ha! You got it, homie!
Jake::: Uh... please, c-come upstairs.
Jake::: My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment.
Bob::: Thank you, Jake. I'm glad the wife and I made the trip from the Crystal Dimension.
Ethel::: Yes, we're eager to know more about the studly young rainicorn that's dating our daughter.
Bob::: Ethel...
Jake::: Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob!
Ethel::: I am a little curious about your goblin. He looks a little odd.
Jake::: Well... he's actually a human.
Ethel::: Oh, Bob! Our future-son-in-law must be filthy-rich to afford a human butler!
Bob::: Shh.Thank you, Jake, for being interested in our daughter!
Jake::: Uh... No problem, Bob!
Ethel::: Oh! Let's play some traditional rainicorn games!
Bob::: Jake, do you know Cameladabalawabapp? 
Jake::: Uh, s-say it again?
Bob::: Cameladabalawabapp!
Jake::: Ohhhh!Cablatapuamba—! I thought you said "Kabloderaga—"!Ah, man, I love gettin' down and dirty with some Cablatapuamba—! Ha! Y'all should go first, though.
Bob::: Hmm. Bold move letting your opponent move first, Jake. I respect that. Very well. Cameladabalawabapp!! 
Ethel::: Oh, Bob!
Bob::: Haha! Your turn, Jake!
Jake::: I...
Finn:::Snacks! Get your snacks!
Jake:::Finn!Dude! I have to show Lady's parents that I have rainbow powers! I need homie help!
Finn::: Hmm... I got a plan, bro-ham. Just stretch your horn at me, and I'll take care of the rest.
Jake::: You're the best, homie.
Finn::: Homies help homies.
Jake::: Haha!Cablatapuamba—!
Ethel::: Very unusual color palette, Jake.
Bob::: Yes. Subtle.
Jake::: Whoo! Oh, yeah!Finn?
Bob::: How about we play some more traditional rainicorn games, my boy?
Jake::: I, uh... Oh. Um... let's do it!
Bob and Ethel::: Let the games begin!
Jake:::I'm sorry.
Jake:::Yo, my bad! I'll get 'im!Hey, man. How's it goin'?
Finn:::IT'S "GOING" CRUD-COW!
Jake::: I know, I know, I'm sorry. But they really like me. Your plan is working perfectly!
Finn::: Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan! Not in the plan!
Jake::: Look, Finn, you know I got yo back fo'-eva', but right now, you're the only one who can help me. Come on, homie.Homies help homies.Hey, guys. You ready to get this game goin' again?
Ethel::: Oh, no, we're pooped.
Bob::: Yeah, we're about ready to break out our picnic basket and dig in!
Jake::: Wohhh, no. You're my guests. Let me take care of you.Homie... help me cook something, please.
Finn::: ...Okay.
Jake::: Thanks, Finn.Okay. Don't worry about a thing. Finn'll make a great lunch. He's a little raw, but he's got great taste.
Bob::: What?! Wow! So wealthy, and so generous!
Ethel::: Ah! I was hoping!I was afraid to ask!
Finn::: WAAAH! Jake!! I think they wanna eat me!!
Ethel::: Of course we do! Jake said you'd "make a great lunch"!
Finn::: JAKE! COME ON!
Jake:::Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man....
Finn::: AAAH! Knock it off, Bob!! 
Ethel:::Don't you touch him!!
Jake::: Come on, stop it, guys! Come on, y'all, I said stop!NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH!!! Nobody's eating Finn!! He's not my butler, and he's not food! Finn is my friend!I'm sorry I let the lies get so far outta hand. I just got so scared of losing Lady!But if they hate me, so be it. No more lies. 
Ethel:::You're a dog?
Jake::: Yeah, I just...Look, I'm sorry about everything. I was—
Bob::: YAAAAAY! HA-HEEEY! HURRAAAAY!
Jake::: Uh... uh...Lady?!
Lady Rainicorn::: 어, 나도 우리 부모님 때문에 걱정했었어! 우리 엄마아빠는 개라면 완전 맛이 가거든! 개가 전쟁터에서 우리 아빠 생명을 구해줬었어! ("Oh, I was worried about my parents! My mom and dad are crazy about dogs! A dog saved my dad in the war!")
Finn::: What did she say?
Jake::: She said she worried that they'd freak out... 'cause her parents are bananas for dogs!
Finn::: J.J. FLIP! What the zip?!
Jake::: Yeah! She says a dog saved her dad in the war!
Finn::: Wow! That's flippin' awesome.
Ethel::: Finn.
Finn:::...Wha?
Ethel::: Listen, I just want you to know how sorry we are about... trying to eat you.
Bob::: It's just we thought we'd never get another chance. We thought humans were extinct.
Finn::: Oh.
Jake::: So... this isn't human?
Ethel::: Oh, no. This is soy people!
Finn::: Oh.
Ethel::: I've never tasted real human before, but they say you can't even tell the difference!
Jake::: Ew... Soy?FINN, YOU'RE DELICIOUS!
