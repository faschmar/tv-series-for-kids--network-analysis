Finn & Jake:::Willy! Willy! Oh, Willy!
Princess Bubblegum:::Sh! There it is. The weeping Willy.One drop of its rare sap can flavor an entire stock pot of soup.
Clone James::: Danger, danger! Whoop whoop! Loose gravel!
Princess Bubblegum:::James?
Clone James:::Look out princess!Poot poot poot shooh!
Princess Bubblegum:::Ow!
Clone James::: 
Princess Bubblegum, Finn & Jake:::James!
Clone James:::Remember me! 
Princess Bubblegum:::Oh, not this again.
Time card:::3 months ago
James:::I'm registering mondo mega rads down there.
Finn:::Huh?Oh, my garf! What are they?!
Princess Bubblegum:::They're toxic creatures, from another time.
Jake::: It can't end like this.
Finn::: James!
Finn:::I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?
Princess Bubblegum:::Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others.
Princess Bubblegum:::And even though he is gone, and it's super sad, I would like to honor James… With this new James I whipped up in the lab!
Clone James:::Jeet!
Princess Bubblegum:::Here you go, James—an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James! 
Finn:::Wow. James sacrificed his life for you again, PB.
Jake:::Yeah, that's like the twenty-fifth time, right?
Finn:::Yeah, obviously we'll have to re-clone him.
Jake:::Totes.
Princess Bubblegum:::Now hold up. This ground is perfectly solid.There's no loose gravel here.
Jake:::So what? Clone him up, girl.
Princess Bubblegum:::James is too reckless. I can't reward this kind of foolish behavior forever. It's time James takes his eternal nap.
Finn:::But it's James!
Jake:::Come P-Gum, don't be all cold-hearty!
Princess Bubblegum:::I'm putting my foot down. There will be no more Jameses.
Finn:::No...
Princess Bubblegum:::I'm sorry. Look, I need you guys to go to James's apartment and box up his stuff.
Jake::: And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake?
Finn:::Yeah, he ate that whole cupcake. What a guy...
Finn::: Is this... James heaven?
Jake::: Jameses!Alright, who's in charge here?
Finn:::James...
James II:::Uh, I'm James number 2. The original James got all goopy in the desert.
Jake:::Explain this biz, James II.
James II:::Well... I was lonely! I knew Princess Bubs would make a new James if, you know, a James died a hero. So...
Finn:::You faked your own death?
James II:::Yeah! I just wanted a friend.Someone who gets me!
Finn:::James...
James II:::Plus, each time I get kerplonked, I get another shiny medal, and why have two medals if you can have all the medals? Medals, medals, medals...
Finn:::Dude, I've been to your funeral like twenty-five times.
James II:::What? The medals make me happy. Plus, PLUS! It's a constant party here inJamestown!
Jake::: PB ain't gonna like this.
Finn:::Hmm hmm!
James II:::Wait, don't tell her! I'll give you a medal.
Jake:::Nah, man. PB's no dummy. She'll find out. It's only a matter of time.
Finn:::We like you James but, you're on your own. We're gonna sit this one out.
Finn:::This should be good.
Jake:::There's Princess Bubblegum!
Princess Bubblegum::: Hey! Stop running! You rascals, get back here! You are all in so much trouble!James!
Jake::: What a show!
Finn:::Very enjoyable!
Princess Bubblegum::: Okay, who's the Banana Guard Leader for this week?
Banana Guard Leader:::I'm the leader.
Princess Bubblegum:::This picture should help you find the Jameses.
Banana Guard Leader:::Hey guys, it's the picture of one of the perpetrators. Take a good look.
Banana Guards:::Ooooh!
Princess Bubblegum:::There's twenty-five of them.
Banana Guard Leader:::I need to see the other twenty-four pictures.
Princess Bubblegum:::Nope, you only need that one.
Banana Guard Leader:::What? How can one picture identify twenty-five perpetrators?
Princess Bubblegum:::It's because they all look the same.
Banana Guard Leader:::Oh okay, I see. There's twenty-five of them! They all look like this guy!
Banana Guard I:::Huh, how can twenty-five guys look like one guy? You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?
Banana Guard Leader:::You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?
Princess Bubblegum:::No! They're clones.
Banana Guard Leader:::What are clones?
Princess Bubblegum::: A group of organisms or cells produced asexually from one ancestor or stock, to which they are genetically identical.
Banana Guard II:::How did that happen?
Princess Bubblegum:::It's a long story.
Banana Guard Leader:::I love long stories.
Princess Bubblegum:::Aaah! There's no time!
Banana Guard Leader:::And they're not brothers?
Princess Bubblegum:::No! They're not brothers, they're clones!
Princess Bubblegum::: Hey! Get down here and help me!Viginti-quintuplets! I'm telling you...
Princess Bubblegum:::What are you doing? Why aren't you helping?
Jake:::Come on PBs, just sit here with us for five minutes.
Princess Bubblegum:::Why?
Jake:::Come on! Five minutes!
Princess Bubblegum:::Maybe just a brick.
Banana Guard Leader::: Hey you, stop!
Clone James I:::Yeah?
Banana Guard Leader:::Have you seen this guy?
Clone James I:::Hmm...
Princess Bubblegum::: I have to admit, it's fun to watch.
Banana Guard Leader::: You two stop too!Show them the picture!
Clone James I:::Alright.
Banana Guard Leader:::Have you guys seen this guy?
Clone James II&III:::Hmm...
Banana Guard Leader:::Let me see that picture again.
Clone James I::: Here you go.
Banana Guard Leader:::Hmm... Hmm...What's your name?
Clone James I:::James.
Banana Guard Leader::: What's your name?
Clone James IV:::James.
Clone James V::: James.
Clone James VI::: James.
Banana Guard Leader:::You're all named James. Is it because you guys look alike?
Clone James VI:::I guess so.
Banana Guard Leader:::Y'know, I was telling this to the guys... If, if we look alike, we should have the same name. It would just make it a little easier. Life, that is. It would make our life a little easier.Aah... Give me a second...Same name... Look alike... You really look alike... Brothers! You're all brothers?
Clone James VI:::No... I don't think so.
Banana Guard Leader::: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-
Clone James VI:::Twenty-five. If you're counting how many of us look alike, there's twenty-five.
Banana Guard Leader:::Hmm... Twenty-five... Not brothers...I think these are the twenty-five that are not brothers.Perpetrators! Get to them! 
Banana Guard II::: Where they'd go?
The four Banana Guards::: It's them!
The four Jameses:::Whoop whoop!
Banana Guards:::Gotcha!
Jameses:::Aww!
Princess Bubblegum:::Okay, fun's over. You're not heroes!You don't deserve these medals.
James II:::Wah, no fair.
