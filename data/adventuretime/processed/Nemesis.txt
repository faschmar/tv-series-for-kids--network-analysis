Starchie:::Glad you could make it. I officially call this meeting of the veritas brigade to order.Lux in tenebris.
Kenneth, Banana Guard, Nurse Pound Cake & Science:::Lux in tenebris.
Starchie::: So, anybody have weird stuff to report?
Nurse Pound Cake:::Well, sometimes at night, I see a shadowy figure around Princess Bubblegum's tower. I have a feeling it might be otherworldly!
Starchie:::Whoa, this is some good stuff. We are this close to finally exposing the princess' shady dealings.Meanwhile, PB remains blissfully unaware up in her ivory tower. 
Kenneth:::Excuse me. I believe I've made a startling discovery of my own.I've developed this high-tech device. It broadcasts waves that—theoretically—disrupt parallel dimensions!
Starchie:::Whoa, Kenny boy, you're blowing my mind. 
Peace Master:::So...a tinkerer, eh? Fiddling at the fringes of unknown realms. Tell me, Kenneth, will you be ready when the flames of those evil places consume everything you hold dear?!I thought not!
Starchie:::Hey, Peace Master.Ohh!Oh! My noodle. 
Peace Master:::There is something very wrong dwelling in the Candy Kingdom...a dark entity I plan to purge from the face of Ooo.
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh! Uh oh!
Peace Master:::Its presence has infected every home, every place of business, even here in this very room.Yes, this foul creature watches us even.. Now!I know you can hear me. Tonight your reign ends.'Cause I am totally gonna vanquish you!
Princess Bubblegum:::Whoa! Holy flippin' flap! Red alert!Pep But, start brewing up some chamomile tea so I don't stress out! 
Peace Master::: Sorry, I hate evil so much.
Starchie:::It's all cool, Peace Master. Truth sleuths keep it real.
Peace Master:::Yes. As lone scouts, we may fall, but together we will stand as a mighty force!Oh, dang. I gotta go.But I shall return in one hour!

Peace Master's Daughter:::Finally.
Peace Master:::Uh, sorry about the wait, guys. Daddy was pontificating.
Peace Master's Daughter::: Hey, Dad, can we go to the Sorcery and Dark Arts fair tomorrow?
Peace Master:::No, honey, that stuff is highly inappropriate for kids. Daddy works very hard to protect you guys from that kind of stuff. If you only knew of the monstrosities that lurk around every corner.
Peace Master's Son::: Dark Arts!
Peace Master::: Stop laughing! You're stressing daddy out!See?! See what happens when you mess with the dark arts?I'll get you, dark one! You wrecked Peace Master's minivan! 
Princess Bubblegum::: Yo! Red alert!Right, guys? What'cha doin' about it?!
Colonel Candy Corn:::Whoa, be careful about old man naptime, please. That could have been it for me just now.
Princess Bubblegum:::What is going on here? 
Banana Guard:::Don't.No!Hey, watch your pieces, man.
Princess Bubblegum::: I thought you were gonna whip these guys into shape, Colonel.
Colonel Candy Corn:::PB, you can't teach a butterfly to bark. You know what I'm saying?Well, they like my stories. They're good listeners. It ain't like them old days with those hard-nosed Rattleball boys.Say, what happened to them Rattleball boys?
Princess Bubblegum::: Okay, you guys. Keep up the good work. 
Finn::: What was your count?
Jake:::Uh, 3 minutes. What about you?
Finn:::Uh, 3 minutes, 30 seconds.
Jake:::What's that? Your invisible watch?
Finn:::No, I was just pointing at my wrist.
Rattleballs::: 57 seconds.
Jake:::Oh, dang, we were both counting fast.
Finn:::Hey, Rattleballs, are you sure you're waterproof?
Rattleballs:::No.
Jake:::Do you even need to breathe, Rattleballs?
Rattleballs:::Continue training. 3, 2, 1...
Princess Bubblegum::: Hey, Peps, where's the tea?!
Peppermint Butler::: Uh, just a second.
Princess Bubblegum:::Just leave it out for me. I'm gonna go find Finn or Rattleballs or somebody to run down this Peace Master bozo."Take my time"? Alright.
Peppermint Butler:::Ooh-wah, oooh-wah. My light will move in darkness. I go unseen by low level biddies.Whah-ha!Yes! Light of the hermit, reveal my nemesis, and in the folds of Horus, carry me in haste! Fold, I say!Yaaaah!
Peace Master::: You going stinkhouse, baby? Ooh.Whomp! Almost got me, but my lucky talisman sensed your presence.
Peppermint Butler::: Haha! 
Peace Master::: Look here, friends. The beast lies exposed!
Starchie::: Oh, this is a mistake. That's my boy, Peppermint Butler.
Peace Master:::His powers of darkness made me go crazy and crash my minivan earlier!
Peppermint Butler:::You need to chill, Peace Master. I'm just a harmless, old butler. 
Peace Master:::Mm?Ha ha!In you go! You see this?! My dark wizard gobbler poots evil souls into the void. 
Starchie:::You can't do that to our friend!
Peace Master:::Oh. I see how it is. Maybe y'all should get in here, too.Digest!
