Finn::: Hmm. 
Ice King::: Hey!You two should get a room! You and that log! Not you and Finn. 'Cause you're huggin' a log, you weirdo!

Finn:::My body is engulfed in flames!Oh, so good!
Finn::: Jake! Jake! I had an awesome dream! Flame Princess was there; My body was on fire. I think it was inspired by Flame Princess battling Ice King yesterday!
Jake::: That's weird. I had a dream too. I'll tell you about it!
Jake::: So then paintings were found and everybody's eyes lit up. Cinnamon Bun smiled and said::: "I saw it from miles away"...
Finn:::Man, I need to have that dream again. I have to get Flame Princess to beat down Ice King again.
Flame Princess::: Why'd you pick this spot?
Finn::: Why does anyone do anything?
Flame Princess::: Hmm...why do they?
Finn:::Mmm?
Flame Princess::: No thanks.
Finn:::Suit yourself!
Ice King::: 
Finn:::Hey, look!Hey, look! There's that big jerk you hate so much, remember?
Ice King:::Oh, hey, kids! Fine day for a picnic.
Finn:::Oh, dang. Did you hear that?! I think he's, like, making fun of you.
Flame Princess::: What?!
Finn::: Yeah, it's in the tone of his voice.
Flame Princess :::What did you say to me?
Ice King::: Uh, what? What did I say?
Flame Princess:::It is in the tone of your voice.
Ice King::: Look, just take whatever you want. Okay? Take it all!It's all just prunes! Prunes and liver! Frozen, of course.
Ice King:::Ah. You might have what it takes to slap these old jowls, but do you have what it takes to face my- just a second...Legion of Snow Warriors?! Go, fight! Protect me!Oh, boy.
Flame Princess::: I don't like being made fun of, Ice King. I don't like it at all! 
Ice King::: Woah! 
Ice King::: Oh, man. Times! I call time! 
Flame Princess::: It's only okay if the person making the fun is someone I'm cool with! 
Ice King::: We're totes cool! I-I'm Ice King!
Flame Princess:::And they do it in a respectful and knowing way!
Ice King::: Respect? I got all kinds of respect!
Flame Princess::: Oh, yeah? Then what's with that stupid smirking face?
Ice King:::Smirk? I smirk when I'm nervous.
Snow Monster::: Bear hug! 
Ice King::: And also when I'm about to win!Booyah!And I didn't even get to test out my new fire-proof grundies!
Finn::: Put it away, man! You didn't win nothing!
Finn:::Are you okay? You feel... lukewarm.
Flame Princess::: I-I just need to burn a couple of forests or something. And get a good night's sleep.
Finn::: Yeah. Sleep.
Finn:::Milk.Milk.Play the sleep jam, BMO.

Finn:::Jake! I had another dream. My body was being blasted. But this time, Ice King was blasting me with ice cubes! Aww. It was awful! And someone else was there. He was just laughing and laughing. He was in the first dream too, but he was whispering. I couldn't make out what he was saying. Oh, yeah!It was the Cosmic Owl!
Jake:::What?! You didn't tell me the Cosmic Owl was there!
Finn::: I couldn't see him last time!
Jake::: Dude, that means it was a prophetic dream! You have to finish the original dream! Cosmic Owl could be whispering something wildly significant! You have to get Flame Princess and Ice King to fight again so you can see the end of the dream! Make 'em fight!
