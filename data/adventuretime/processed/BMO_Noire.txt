BMO::: Haha! Take that, Master Chen!
Finn::: JAAAAKE!
Jake::: What?
Finn::: Jake, did you hide my sock?
Jake ::: No, man, I told you,
Jake::: I don't do that kinda stuff anymore.
Finn::: So, what? It just magically disappeared?
Jake::: I don't know...
Jake::: Maybe.
Finn::: Is that just a cute way of saying you took it?
Jake::: No!
Finn::: Why don't you just help me find my sock?
Jake:::Oh, Finn lost his sock! Everybody stop what you're doing and help Finn find his precious sock!
BMO:::It looked like a tough case to crack. But I hate to see good friends fight.
BMO:::So I decided to take the case.
BMO:::Hmm... 
BMO:::Ronnie!
BMO:::It looked like I had a guilty mouse.
BMO::: 
BMO::: Huh!
BMO::: Hello, Ronnie.
BMO ::: What do you want, BMO?
BMO::: Where is Finn's sock?
BMO ::: I don't know what you're talking about, BMO. I didn't do nothin'. Leave me alone!
BMO:::I knew that lipstick anywhere. 
BMO:::How is Lorraine?
BMO ::: You stay away from her! She is with me now, do you hear?
BMO::: Calm down, big guy. Me and Lorraine are dinosaur bones.
BMO ::: Good, 'cause I would be so jealous.
BMO::: Just tell me where the sock is, and I will let you go.
BMO ::: I don't know, man.
BMO::: What if I put some knuckle in your eyeballs? Would that help you think?
BMO ::: Ok! Ok! Umm...
BMO :::It looks like a grape juice stain on his sock; check the pantry.
BMO:::Of course I didn't trust Ronnie, but I had no other leads.Maybe the grape juice had some secrets to tell me. Or maybe Ronnie was just pulling my hair. 
BMO::: 
BMO:::Just as I thought, not even opened. I fell right into his trap.
BMO:::Let me out, you! I'll get you! Piece of... you! Ronnie!Officer Davis! Thank goodness. I... 
BMO ::: BMO, what are you doing here?
BMO::: Looking for Finn's socks, same as you.
BMO ::: We got this to under control.Stay out of police business, or you will be the one behind bars.
BMO:::I didn't listen to that cop. I needed to find Ronnie, and I knew just the lady who could lead me to him.She looked as beautiful as ever.
BMO::: Where is the sock, Lorraine? 
BMO ::: What makes you think I know? 
BMO::: I saw your lipstick on his fur, so don't act so cute. 
BMO ::: Sounds like someone's jealous, no?
BMO::: Don't count on it, Lorraine. Now tell me where Ronnie is.
BMO ::: Ha! You think it was Ronnie? Maybe if he was man enough to steal a sock, I wouldn't have to spend my nights with Bebe.
BMO::: Bebe? So you're saying Bebe is man enough?
BMO ::: What? No, you're putting words in my mouth. Bebe doesn't know anything about Finn's sock.
BMO:::Finn's sock? How did you know it was Finn's sock? I never said whose sock was stolen, Lorraine.
BMO ::: Uh... uh... I heard it on the TV news.
BMO::: No dice, sweet beak. Officer Davis has this case under tight wraps.
BMO ::: Oh, fine, Bebe stole the sock. Oh, BMO, can't you just forget about it?
BMO:::Sorry, lady, forgetting ain't in my job description. Ha ha ha!
BMO ::: Does that mean you still remember... us?
BMO::: ... Hahaha! Same old Lorraine.
BMO ::: Well, don't tell Ronnie about me and Bebe.You know how he gets when he's jealous. 
BMO:::Bebe owned Bebe's, a dance club downtown.He yells at ladies!
BMO::: Wake up, brainiac.
BMO ::: BMO? Uh...uh...auh!
BMO::: Where is the sock, Bebe?
BMO ::: Uh ... I don't know nothing about socks!
BMO::: Don't play dumb, Bebe!Don't play dumb with me!
BMO ::: 
BMO::: I talked to Lorraine, Bebe. She sold you out, dumb dumb!
BMO ::: No! She-she wouldn't do that! It wasn't me, I swear! It was Ronnie!
BMO:::Ronnie? But why?
BMO ::: I don't know, man! I don't know!Oh, Lorraine! 
BMO:::I'm gonna go wash this shmutz off my grabbers. When I get back, you better start talking sense!
BMO:::It wasn't adding up. Why would Ronnie swipe the sock? And why would Lorraine finger Bebe?Sure, he's a dirt bag born out of a mother, but who's not?
BMO:::I don't really get it.
BMO:::Maybe it was time to cut my losses.
BMO::: Come on, Bebe, let's get you cleaned up. Bebe?
BMO::: Bebe!Dead. This doesn't look good. I'd better hightail it!
BMO::: Huh? The cops!? It was a setup!
BMO:::Oh no!Bang, bang! Pew, pew, pew!
Jake :::Hey, has anyone seen BMO?BMO? Where's BMO?
BMO:::Hello?
 BMO::: With the lipstick, she looked as beautiful as ever.
Finn:::I'm worried about BMO.
BMO:::This is real.
Jake:::BMO!
BMO:::Who's BMO?
Different BMO::: Hello. 
Neptr::: Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, BMO. Wake up, buddy. Are you alright?
BMO::: Neptr? I feel like I got hit with a Dracula by King Kong.
Neptr::: Whoa, sorry, man. You want some pie or something?
BMO::: Sorry, I gotta run. The cops are after me. Have you seen any down here?
Neptr::: Nah, no one's been down here all day except me, you, and Ronnie.
BMO::: What?! What was Ronnie doing down here?!
Neptr::: I don't know, but now my sensors indicate that some treasure is missing ...about a sock's worth.
BMO:::That's it! That's why Ronnie took the sock::: To carry stolen treasure in with! He had to whack Bebe to keep him from squealing, then he pinned the rap on me.
Neptr::: Bebe's dead?
BMO::: Listen, Neptr::: you better lay low for awhile. I'm gonna go find Ronnie . I've got a score to settle.
Neptr::: Hey, BMO. We should hang out more. We're both robots.
BMO::: No, Neptr. I am not like you.
BMO::: Ronnie?
BMO ::: Evening, BMO.
BMO ::: Don't worry, buddy. You're off the hook. We know it was Ronnie who killed Bebe and snatched the treasure . We found this confession on him after the shootout.
BMO::: Hmmmmm...what about the sock?
BMO ::: Forget the sock, BMO. The case is closed. Let it go, buddy. It's over.
BMO ::: Maybe he was right. But I just couldn't shake the feeling that, somehow, this case had slipped right through my fingers.Lipstick? 
BMO::: Lorraine!
BMO ::: BMO?
BMO::: Get back here with that treasure, Lorraine!
BMO ::: Sorry, BMO. I earned this loot. Those chumps were not framing themselves. See you around, BMO.
BMO::: Lorraine, wait! What about the sock, Lorraine?
BMO ::: Oh, that old thing? I hid that where no one would ever find it::: in our secret, grown-up kissing spot. Remember?
BMO ::: It was good to see you again, BMO . Till next time.
BMO::: Till next time, Lorraine.
Jake::: Ya see, man? That was really fun. You don't need two socks to have fun. 
Finn::: Yeah, I guess. But maybe it woulda been more fun with two socks! 
BMO::: Finn, Finn! I know where your sock is!
Finn::: Huh?
BMO:::It was in your pillow this whole time! See?
Finn::: Whoa haha!Right on, BMO!
BMO::: Ronnie the mouse stole it, but Lorraine chicken set him up to kill Bebe, but the flatfoot busted Ronnie, and Lorraine skedaddled with the loot, but BMO solved the case!
Finn::: Yay, BMO! Yay! Yeah!
BMO::: Yay, BMO!
Finn::: Yay!
BMO::: Yay, BMO!
Jake::: Our chicken's name is Lorraine?
BMO::: She's red hot like pizza supper .
