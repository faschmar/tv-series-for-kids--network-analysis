Jake::: Man... let's go home.
Finn::: Nuts to that. I wanna find a mystery cave.
Jake:::But, Finn, I'm gettin' all cranky around my joke-hole.
Finn::: Ow!
Jake::: Oof!
Finn::: Ooh-la-la.
Jake::: Whuzzat?
Finn::: Mystery cave! C'mon, Jake!Oh, my glory...
Jake::: Dude, no!! Don't touch that thing! It's probably got some kind of sacred significance.
Finn::: Yeah. I want it for my sacred bathroom.
Jake::: Finn?!Oh, my Jah! Finn's become one with the lamb!!
Finn::: Jake!! You see this crazy jazz?!
Jake::: We'll get through this, my bro. I swear, I'm gonna get you out of that lamb.
Finn::: Jake! C'mon quit messin' with me.WHOA!
Jake:::Ow. Ow.Ow. 
Jake::: Wish I knew how to free you, bro.
Finn::: Me, too, bro.
Jake::: BMO, stop fake-farting.
BMO::: But Finn always loved BMO farting. 
Finn::: Heh heh heh heh heh!
Jake::: Hmm...That's it! We'll do all Finn's favorite stuff 'til he comes out! BMO! Play Finn's favorite song!
BMO::: Okay!
Finn::: What? Nooo...No! Not this song!!
Jake::: Are you hearing this, buddy?
Finn::: Guys... I haven't liked this song since I was two.Cut it OUT! 
Ice King::: Leaf Princess!Come to me, my arboreal beauty! Gotcha!
Finn:::It's just a dumb old leaf, ya dumb old Ice King.
Ice King:::I know, but it's mine.
Finn::: Wait! What?! Ice King! You can hear me?
Ice King::: Yes... Why? Are you makin' fun of me or something?
Finn::: No, it's just no one else can see me or hear me talk.
Ice King::: Ohhhh, yeah.... You're trapped in the Spirit Realm. I can see all things Spirit with my... Wizard Eyes!
Finn::: Man... Never thought I'd be happy to talk to you, Ice King. Can ya help me get free??
Ice King::: Oh, yeah, I know all the ins and outs. And I'd do anything for a friend like you.
Penguin::: Wenk.
Ice King::: Quiet, Gunter. Can'tya see I'm hanging with Finn?
Penguin::: Wenk wenk.
Ice King::: I know I say that a lot, but this time it's true!
Finn::: Anyways... Where do all these spirits come from?
Ice King::: Oh, there are portals all over the universe. I have one in my basement! Every once in a while, a real cutie pie drifts through. Ooh!Oh, gosh, there she is.Mm, oh, yeah... 
Finn::: Sick.
Ice King::: What? I swear I never touch 'em! I can't!Can't touch this, can't touch this...Can't touch this, either.Yep, I can't kill any of them.I hate them... Okay, alright! 'Nuff messin' around. Let's getcha free from the Spirit Plane.
Finn::: Cool.
Ice King::: Sooo, the only way to get out of the Spirit World is to stick all these lousy things in the Spirit Hole down there. Then plug up the hole with that.
Finn::: And doing that will set me back to normal??
Ice King::: Mm-hmmmm, trust me! We are tur-bros! Turbo bros! Tur-bros. Turbo. ...Bros.
Finn:::So be it!
Jake::: Alright, Finn. This oughta free you from your body prison. Couple-a' rounds of Kompy's Kastle will jog your psychic schnaps. That's what I think. Co-op mode like we always do! Oh, yeah! C'mon, Finn, drop the drawbridge. Kompy's blood lust meter's goin' down. Lemme help ya there.Whuzza!! You love Kompy! 
Finn::: I... did it.I did it. I'm ready, Ice King. Make me normal now.
Ice King::: Ohhh, that's not all of 'em. There's this other guy that watches me. He's... super creepy.Do ya see it?? Oh, it see's you...Catch it and put it in the Spirit Hole! In the Spirit Hole where it can't see me anymore so you can be free!!Get it! Get it!!GET IT IN THE HOLE!!
Finn:::Ew! Ew! Ew!Eeeewwww!! 
Ice King::: Yes! It's gone!
Finn::: So... now I can go back to normal.
Ice King::: Uhhh, wait, though.
Finn::: ...What?
Ice King::: There's this last guy you gotta get. He's pretty much the worst. He usually leaves these gross heads around, but I'm not seeing them anywheâ€” OH!THERE IT IS! THERE IT IS!!
Head::: Wanwan. Wanwan. Wanwan.
Ice King:::Nooo...
Head::: Wanwan! Wanwan!
Ice King::: NO! DON'T COME NEAR ME!!
Head::: Wanwan!
Finn::: What is that?
Ice King::: It's from the dead one. He leaves these heads around everywhere. I can't even touch them, but it still creeps me out...
Head::: Wanwan!
Ice King::: Please get rid of him!
Finn::: What do I do? Follow the heads?
Ice King:::USE THE HEADS!! Oh, snow, please!
Finn:::Alright, man, I'll get it.Where's your daddy, huh? Is he hiding in there?
Head::: Wanwan.
Finn::: You better get back in the Spirit Hole, dead one.Okay... 
The Dead One:::Wamwanwan.
Finn::: Oh, my what? The cave?? How the...??? ...Weird. That's weird, but whatevs, though.Whatevs. Ice King! Ice Kiiiing!Where'd you go, Simon?Ice King?Dude, come on, what?
Ice King::: Ha ha, Finn! You fell right into for my brilliant plan ' that I formed out of the thin air like a true Magi! Not only did I get you to remove those horrible creatures from my castle, but now you're trapped, and only I can see you. So if you want friends, this is it, pal! 
Finn:::I'm gonna re-open the hole.
Ice King::: NO, WAIT, MY PLAN FELL APART!!My... new plan is that you don't open the hole, and I destroy the porcelain lamb which will bring you back to the material plane. Heh heh... heh.
Ice King::: Jake.AGH, BLUH! GIMME THAT LAMB!
Jake::: NO!!Finn's trapped in here!!
Ice King::: That's why I have to smash it!!
Jake::: You donk! I will smash you!! WAAAH!! 
Ice King::: Escaped!AAAH! My winter body!! I was gonna start up on the elliptical again, but I got depressed, okay?! Don't look at me!! 
Jake:::Whoooo?!
Ice King::: AAH! They're touching me for real! EWW!!
Finn::: Great. Now we're both stuck in here.
Ice King:::FINN, GIVE ME YOUR CLOTHES! 
Finn::: STOP! WUUH!
Ice King::: I need a buffer!! AAAH! 
Finn::: Ah, jeez, come on!
Ice King:::I'm sorry... I'm sorry, they were just touching me on the body... I'm sorry... 
Finn::: Whoa, do that again.Your hand is affecting the TV! We must have some kinda subtle effect on the material plane!
Ice King::: Cooool. Whaddaya think, Finn? Can we pull back the veil of static and reach into the source of all being? Behind this curtain of patterns... this random pattern generator... So clever... right here in every home, watching us from a one-sided mirror...Heh heh heh, whoops! Just wizard-talkin' to myself!
Finn::: It's okay! But let's use our subtle influence to break the lamb!
Ice King::: Yeah, a'ight. You mean like this?
Finn::: Yeah, man! Bwoooo!It's workin', man! Combine the swirls!
Ice King::: Okay! Wha-zah!!
Jake::: Whoa! Finn, is that you?!
Finn:::YES!!
Jake::: Finn! Finn! Finn!Whooooaaaa...That was beautiful!
Finn::: Heh-heh.
Jake::: Let's go flush this in the sacred bathroom!
