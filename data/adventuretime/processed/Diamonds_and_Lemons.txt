Finn:::You sad mobs. Y'all wish you had this sweet dang bucket!Yaaaah!Aah! It's mine time!Get beat dead-meat!My tool! Die!Oh, a li'l zombie carrot.I should've washed it.
Lemongrab:::Impertinence.Nyah! Grow! Grooow!
Jake:::Aha! 
Finn::: Head's up! Oof.
Jake:::Oof.
Finn:::I got that bucket of pure river water you asked for. 
Jake:::Thanks, dude.
Finn:::Whatcha doing down here anyways?
Jake:::Digging up diamonds for a little project.
Finn:::I'll help, buddy.
Jake:::Whew.
Jake:::Hehe.Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods!
Finn:::What the heck man?!It's such a senseless waste.
Jake:::Au contraire, mon friend. I'm extremely senseful. You see this bucket of water? It's in case I fall in the lava and catch fire.
Finn:::You could make something really good with these. Like a better sword for your best bro.
Jake:::Or .
Finn::: I'm gonna take this shiny boy, and show you the way.
Jake:::You do you, buddy.
Finn:::I'm sure you'd get it if you just took a moment to think about it. 
Jake::: Uh huh.
Lumpy Space Princess:::Look guys, it was totally epic. I wrecked the library's glass ceiling like, NBD, then I pushed a creeper down there and all the stupid smart dorks cried like tiny stupid babies.
Gunter::: Wenk wenk.
Live-Giving Magus:::That's small potaters. We should do something big. I got a storage full of live dynamite. 
Ice King:::Hey. We should grief Finn and Jake. We could plant a tree on the Tree House! Huh..?
Lumpy Space Princess:::Ugh. It's totally obvious you've never griefed anybody.
Ice King:::That's only technically true. And not to be "that guy", but it's actually"aggrieved".
Lumpy Space Princess:::You better grief someone quick if you wanna stay in the Gravel Gang! Only cool mean girls allowed!
Ice King:::I'm ice-cool LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess:::No! Call me by my gang name!
Ice King:::Okay. Gravel Gal.
Lemongrab:::Hnnngh. Grooooow!Oh. Yes, of course.Grow. No grooooowth!
Marceline:::Who here loves windmills?Haha, alright. Now get to work.
Finn:::Yo, Marcy. That's a real nice windmill.
Marceline:::Thanks. When it's done, I'm gonna grind up a whole mass of bone meal.
Skeleton:::What's that, boss?
Marceline:::Keep working, buddy. So, whatcha got there?
Finn:::A little lump destined for something big.
Marceline:::Just like your butt. Hah!
Finn:::Good one. But no. I want to turn this diamond into something complex and awesome to really wow Jake.
Marceline:::Well I recommend building a windmill.
Finn:::A diamond windmill.
Princess Bubblegum:::No, that's silly. You need something more sciencey.Diamond, lapis, some gunpowder, juicy nugget, add the star to more gunpowder and paper - There!I'm positive Jake will appreciate it for both its fleeting sensation of beauty, and its false sense of purpose.
Finn::: Up top.
Princess Bubblegum:::What? Aw blocks.
Finn:::He's been at it all day.
Princess Bubblegum:::I should help him. See you later Finn.
Finn:::Alright. M'ladies.M'lemon. 
Lemongrab:::Nyarg! 
Princess Bubblegum:::Hey, it's okay buddy.
Lemongrab:::Can't... tree!
Princess Bubblegum:::You can't just hit something with a shovel and expect it to do your bidding.
Marceline:::Yeah you can.
Lemongrab:::What?
Princess Bubblegum:::This is an oak sapling. This is a jungle sapling. . And this...This is a lot of bone meal.
Marceline:::Courtesy of Marceline the Bone Meal Queen.
Princess Bubblegum:::Now we don't actually need the bone meal but it'll help speed things up, and as for the space requirements on the ground, it depends... 
Tree Trunks:::How many aces do you have?
Mr. Pig:::I got five.
Tree Trunks:::Oh shoot, I only got two.
Finn:::Hey y'all. 
Tree Trunks:::Finn!
Finn:::I was just passing through, but I could sure go for one of your famous apple pies.
Tree Trunks:::Say no more. 
Finn:::I'm no expert, but that kinda looks like a pumpkin.
Tree Trunks::: Sorry about that. I'm just plum out of apples but I got lots of pumpkins. Too many pumpkins.Hot pie.
Finn::: Uh, this might sound a bit weird but I'm kinda tired and it's a long way home...
Tree Trunks:::Say no more. 
Mr. Pig:::Fine.
Tree Trunks:::Bye bye boys.
Finn:::Whoa!
Mr. Pig::: You know you could just tell me where to go.
Finn::: Dude, stop. Enderman. Don't look at it. It will-
Mr. Pig:::What the heck is that?!
Finn:::Oh Glob.
Finn:::Hey!
Mr. Pig:::Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee!
Finn:::Enderman! Fight me!Oh no.
Finn:::So, uh... Do you have, like, another job, or is this what you do full time? I saw you carrying that block back there. You into building stuff?
Finn:::I bet endermen have hobbies just like everyone else.
Lemongrab:::Who-aah? Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm.
Princess Bubblegum:::Whew. Good work. Let's call it a day.
Lumpy Space Princess::: Meh. Beh. Beans? Beans.That noise.Finn, I'm trying to sleep!
Finn::: Hey LSP. Don't be scared.
Lumpy Space Princess::: What are you even doing, just looking at this guy's toes?
Finn:::Yeah, I have to.
Lumpy Space Princess:::Oh. I don't get it. Does this guy even have toes? Are those his toes? I don't think I've ever even seen a toe, come to think of it. What am I even talking about?
Finn::: Thank you I've been stuck here so long!
Lumpy Space Princess::: Haha. Sure... Ew! You're all smelly and wet. Get out of here!
Finn:::Fair enough. 
Lumpy Space Princess::: But come back after you've showered.
Ice King:::Yoink. 
Finn:::Thief!
Ice King:::You got griefed!I'm not looking at you! I'm not looking!
Lemongrab::: Good morning. How dare you.Lemon seed babies!Oh, you shall be my true heirs.What?! A apple?Unacceptable! UNACCEPTABLE!
Tree Trunks:::Oh, gracious.Good job, Lemon-crab. 
Lemongrab::: Pie me. Pie me for my apples.
Jake:::Pie.
Finn:::You won't believe what I went though to get this.
Jake:::Oh yeah, you were gonna make something right? 
Finn::: Whoa! You did it! You took the fruits of our labor and transformed them into something beautiful and unexpected.
Finn:::D'aw come on! Diamonds are so hard to get!Oh, duh. Beauty is in the hard work itself and the oftentimes false sense of purpose we feel when doing it. It's a fleeting sensation that drives us to repeat our actions in order to capture it again.That was supposed to be fireworks.
Jake:::I like this better.
