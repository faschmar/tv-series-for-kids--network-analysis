LSP:::Ugh.Reduced to marking my camp with bear sweat. Those bears did not want to give up that sweat,but it keeps the rodents from nibbling my lumps while I sleep. Ouch! I feel something crunchy! Like fried chicken!Oh, it is fried chicken!
LSP:::Oh, my Glob—forest creature! I'd better eat it real fast!
LSP::: Get back here!Aah!What my life has become!
LSP:::Hello? Oh, my Glob!
Tree Trunks:::Oh, wonderful!Welcome in, LSP. Uh, I want to go through—
LSP:::This place is so clean and nice!
Tree Trunks:::You're so kind.
LSP:::Do you have a sink?!
Tree Trunks:::Uh, there's one in the kitchen, and—
LSP:::I'll use the one in the kitchen!
Tree Trunks:::I need to tell you all the s—
LSP:::Get me a towel!
LSP:::Help me down!
Tree Trunks::: O-okay, I-I really do need to tell you how to care for Sweet P. Uh, there's a proper procedure for Sweet P's special tuck-in time. You have to be real sweet to him. Pat him gently on the head, kiss his cheeks...
LSP:::What?
Tree Trunks:::...And give him treats. Sing to him real, real soft and sweet and touch your forehead to his and think the words, "You are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you." Then he'll fall asleep and have sweet dreams.
LSP:::Oh, my Glob, I'll do all that! Okay, bye! Have a wonderful time!Time to get down to the chill-out!
LSP:::What a princess like me deserves.Aah! Don't hurt me!
Sweet P:::I'm Sweet P.
LSP:::I didn't know you were huge.
Sweet P:::I'm hungry.
LSP:::Okay, let's check what's in the fridge.Do you like pizza?
Sweet P:::I like pizza.
LSP:::Get the pizza, Sweet P!
LSP::: Now I can kick back.Refrigerators are just great! I never stopped to think how great they are.Now I'm cold, though.Oh, what?!I'm still cold.Rich-person indoor fire is just so great.I'm feeling all toasty! Must be time for toast!I'm waiting... Waiting... Waiting... All done!It's not black and crunchy like when I throw bread into my campfire.
LSP:::This music's way better than owls' hoots.
LSP::: I deserve this.
LSP:::No! You're an animal! You can't come inside!
Sweet P::: I'm ready to be tucked in now. Hello? Will you be sweet to me?
Sweet P::: Sweetness must be out there in the night to guide my sleepy boat right. 
Marceline:::Yo!
LSP:::Hey, Marcy!
Marceline:::LSPita bread, what's up? 
LSP:::Just chillin' in my awesome bubble bath!
Marceline:::Did you break into someone's house again?
LSP:::Ugh! I have a new life now and a career.
Marceline:::I didn't know you had any skills.
LSP:::Success isn't about skills. It's about being cool. These people just randomly approached me, like, "Hey, we will totally pay you to hang out in our sick mansion and feed our baby" or whatever.
Marceline:::Well, good for you, dude.
LSP:::I mean, I feel like a totally new person now that I'm finally getting what I deserve.
LSP:::Oh, my Glob, what is that?!
LSP:::Aah! 
Marceline:::LSP? Mm.
Raccoon::: 
LSP:::Take this, you dandruff! 
Raccoon:::LSP.
LSP:::Huh?
Raccoon:::You don't belong here in the world of decent people. You belong in the woods with...garbage animals!
LSP:::Noooooooo!
Sweet P:::Will you be sweet to me?
Sweet P:::Will you kiss my cheeks?
Sweet P::: Will you give me treats?
Sweet P::: Blech! 
Sweet P:::Will you be sweet to me?
Banana Guards:::Wee-Ooo! Wee-Ooo! Wee-Ooo! Wee-Ooo!
LSP:::Agh! 
Raccoon:::Look what you've done, LSP.
LSP:::Huh?
Raccoon:::You made it gross. Everything you touch turns gross!
LSP:::Uh...
Raccoon:::Just like you!
LSP:::Aah!
Raccoon::: You don't really think you deserved any of this, do you? You're a rat, just a giant rat that wandered into somebody's nice house.
LSP:::I'm a good person! I take care of babies!Look! Baby Sweet P?Baby Sweet P! Oh, my Glob, I lost the baby! I lost the baby!I'm a bad person!
Raccoon::: Just accept that you're garbage!
LSP:::Hi-yah!Baby Sweet P! 
LSP:::Have you seen a big, fat child around here?!Have you seen my enormous baby?!If only I'd cooked the pizza!
LSP:::I could've eaten some, too! I'm so stupid!You got to help me! I lost some old couple's baby 'cause I didn't do the sweet things! I just wanted a bubble bath, and... How did I lose something so bi-i-i-i-g?! 
Banana Guard:::Ma'am, you're gonna have to come with us.
LSP:::Baby Sweet P!Give me that donut! 
Banana Guard:::No!
LSP:::I'm not a bad person! I'm not a bad person!
LSP:::Huh?
Banana Guard:::Hey, big baby!
LSP:::I found you!
Sweet P::: LSP!
LSP:::Sweet P! I'm so sorry! I should've been sweet to you! Here, okay, um... Pat very gently on the head... Kiss on both cheeks... Mwah! Mwah! Treat. 
Sweet P:::Mmm! 
LSP:::Uh, and sing something sweet.Butter cakes, cupcakes, and ice cream cakes small baby bums and the friendship of puppiesYou are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you.
LSP:::Aww!
Tree Trunks:::We're ho-o-me!
LSP:::Shh! He's asleep.
Tree Trunks:::Why is Sweet P's blanket on the wall—?
LSP:::Shh!Mr. and Mrs. Pig Trunks, I have some good news. Sweet P has grown so attached to me that it would be cruel for me to leave him, obviously. So... Yes, I will accept the position as your live-in nanny!
LSP:::Huh?
Raccoon:::Partake of the chicken. 
LSP:::Chicken...
LSP:::This is good chicken!
Tree Trunks::: Maybe we can get, uh, Neptr to sit. I don't know.
Sweet P:::Mama? I had that dream again—the one where I'm a comet boy.
Tree Trunks:::Oh, really?
Sweet P:::Yeah, coming back to Ooo over and over, and there was a fake comet, a beard man in a spaceship.
Tree Trunks:::My, what an imagination...
Sweet P:::The comet... approacheth.
