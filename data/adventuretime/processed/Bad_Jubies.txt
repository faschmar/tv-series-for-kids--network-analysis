Lumpy Space Princess::: Duh! This bunker is the worst!
Jake::: Nah, nah. I think this storm's carrying some Major negative energy or something.

Tornado Man::: What are those noises?!

Tornado Man::: ' It makes me feel some type of way.
Jake::: How about you pause that stormin' for a sec so you can hear the rest of it?
Tornado Man::: Wait. Wait, wait. That one. Wh-wh-what's that one?
Lumpy Space Princess::: '
Tornado Man::: No, no, no. That "tweet tweet" one. ' Yes! Ohh I haven't heard that sound since I was a baby breeze.
Jake::: What? You forgot what a bird sounds like? No wonder you're depressed! You know, you should really stop and slow down more often.
Finn::: Yeah. You get to hear life happening. Makes you feel good.
Tornado Man::: ' Ahhhh. You're right! I've been a freaky storm for so long that I forgot it's okay to be a breeze sometimes. I-if you'll excuse me, I'm going to explore the rest of this beautiful day.
Jake::: Wait! Here, man. Take my notebook. It's got the sheet music to my jam.
Tornado Man::: Really? You would do that?
Jake::: Yeah, just take it.
Tornado Man::: ' Thank you so much, stretchy dog. This is one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me. Outey!
Lumpy Space Princess::: Yes! The sun!
