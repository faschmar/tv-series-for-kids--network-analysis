Finn:::Aw, yes. Storm has passed! Jake!Jake...
Jake:::Nachos?
Finn:::Nachos? I love nachos...I love nachos even more when looking out of the window! 
Finn:::Hmmm, does that box have a face on it? A face... I gotta make sure.
Finn::: There's a box outside with a face on it! It might be the boxman, it's all soggy and dirty. Want to check it out?
Jake:::Naaaaa... chos.
Finn::: I'm gonna check it out.
Jake:::Yeah, whatever.
Finn:::Hmmm, where'd your face go? 
Finn:::Whoa! Okay... shhh... are you lost, little cardboard dude?
Finn:::Jake! There seems to be a lost cat on the ground in a box!
Jake:::Yeah that's great, get it out of here!
Finn:::Hm, gettin' no help from him I guess. Do you know where your home is?
Finn:::Okay, I'll follow you!
Finn:::Whoa, is this your kingdom? It's wonderful!
Finn:::That must be your prince.
Finn:::Huh?
Finn:::Huh... a prince wouldn't steal from his subjects.Awww!
Finn:::Switched?Of course! You must be the real prince, and that thief took your place! Is that right, little prince?
Finn::: Don't worry, your majesty. I'll help you reclaim your kingdom. 
BMO::: Why do you hate cats, Jake?
Jake:::Move your face, you're messing up the game. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about it, it's personal. Cats know what they did...
BMO:::Is Jake okay?
Jake:::Eugh... no! I'm pretty dang far from okay! There's a little shard of Tortilla chip caught between my teeth. 
Finn:::First, we have to expose the traitor's deception. Ah-hah! That's a counterfeit crown, from the liar's own box flesh. Hmm... it looks like your crown was torn off by some... 
Box Prince::: Mew.
Finn:::Your crown was lost, you say?
Finn:::During a storm? The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods? Until you were delivered into my door step? Right... so it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince.
Finn::: Um... I'm gonna wait over by the gate, your highness.
BMO::: Get big, and the chip will fall out of your teeth!
Jake:::You think I can stretch out of everything? You're so na√Øve. To live life, you need problems.
BMO:::That's stupid!
Jake:::If you get everything you want the minute you want it, then what's the point of livin'?
Finn:::Okay, so let's retrace your steps. Do you remember which path you took? ... Prince?
Finn:::Whoa, you found it already! Good work, team. 
Finn:::Ow, quit that!Come on, you're a prince.Come, your majesty. It's time...
Finn::: People of the Box Kingdom, I have found...your true prince!J'accuse!
Finn:::What? They... they don't believe us. The rain made your complexion look all hobo-like. They're not looking past the surface grunk.
Finn:::Oh no, he's challenging you to a joust! I better find you a lance.
BMO:::Did it come out?
Jake:::You forgot the most important part, my impatient little friend. A thorough rinsing! 
BMO:::Well?
Jake::: Bleh, nothing.I need, like, a toothpick, or something.
BMO:::I told you to buy floss.
Jake:::Floss is for losers. 
Jake:::Oh, one of these will do nicely.
BMO:::You'll put cards in your mouth?!
Jake:::Just the edge, kid, then I'll work it like a pro. Now, to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality.
Finn:::Trial by combat shall prove which prince's true!
Finn:::The joust's gone nuts!
Jake:::Hey, BMO! Ta-da!
BMO::: You did it, Jake! Congratulations! How did you get the piece of tortilla chip out of your teeth?
Jake:::Oh, I didn't. It's still there.It'll be like a constant reminder of what life's all about.
BMO:::... This is unsatisfying!
Jake:::ZIP IT!
Finn::: Bad! Bad princes!
Finn:::Which is which...?
Finn:::Awwww!This is the one! This is your prince!
Finn::: Or maybe this is the one!
Finn:::Hmmm, is this... is this even a kingdom?
Finn:::Haha! Hey! Ow, you guys... aw, come on!
