Swamp Giant::: AAAAH!
Finn::: Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen!
Swamp Giant::: NEVER!!
Finn::: Huh?Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er!
Jake::: Then hold my hand, dude!Whoooop!
Swamp Giant::: Aaaah! Oof!
Finn::: My inflatable angel.
Jake::: Heh heh heh.How's the Mini Queen?
Finn::: I dunno. Can't understand a word she says.Aww! My pleasure, ma'am! I just like beating up evil!Okay... Didn't... catch any of that either.
Jake:::Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky.No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way!Whoa!
Finn::: What?
Jake:::Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy!
Finn::: Billy?!
Finn and Jake:::BIIILLYYYYYY!!!
Young Billy::: Nothung!
Finn::: Oh, yeah! That was the most mathematical thing ever!
Jake::: Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear!
Finn::: This is so cool!
Finn and Jake::: Whoa!
Finn::: It's Billy's legendary crack!
Billy:::Hello.
Finn:::It's him! It's him!!
Jake:::I know, I know! Be cool!!
Billy::: Yep. It's me.
Finn::: Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!
Billy::: What for?
Finn::: So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!
Jake::: I wanna be the dog version of you!
Billy::: Ahh, that'd be a waste of time.
Jake::: Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups!
Billy::: No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail.
Jake::: Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch!Ah... ah...
Finn::: What do you mean, "pointless?" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!
Billy::: You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead.In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog.
Jake:::Heh... I'm gonna pass out... 
Billy::: All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures.But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!
Jake::: What other way is there?
Billy::: Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.
Finn::: Nonviolently??I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...
Jake::: Me, too!
Finn::: Billy, I won't let you down!
Jake::: I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy!
Finn::: This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct.
Jake::: Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people.
Cobbler::: Help! Help!A monster!Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible Dragon! Please, please help!
Finn::: Oh, uh...
Jake::: Oh...
Cobbler::: Act quickly! He's almost upon us!
Jake:::Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore.
Cobbler::: No, but please! 
Finn:::Dude. We gotta do something to help him.
Jake::: I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz.
Finn:::Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?
Cobbler::: Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry.
Jake::: Say no more.Come on, Finn.
Cobbler::: Where're you going?!
Jake::: To make you somethin' to eat!
Cobbler::: AAAH!! NO!! HELP!!
Finn::: I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon.
Jake::: Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im.Gruel! Get your free gruel!
Lady:::What's this all about?
Finn::: Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure!
Lady::: Hahaha!I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate.
Finn:::YEAH!!!
Finn::: This is great, Jake!
Jake::: Yeah, we're really helpin' people!
Finn::: Whoa! Look who it is!
Jake::: Dude! You're alive!
Cobbler:::No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for...a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week—
Jake:::Dude. Gruel.
Cobbler::: Oh, thank you!Hahahaha! Hahaha.AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
Finn::: Huh?Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor.
Cobbler::: Wha? Ah... uh?!
Jake::: Dude... how much of that potion did you use?
Townsperson::: AAAAH!! MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!!
Finn:::Geez... I thought people would like that.
Cobbler::: Why?! Why would anyone want that?!
Finn::: So you can defend against evil monsters!
Cobbler::: You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!
Finn::: No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!
Cobbler::: Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!
Finn::: Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?
Finn and Jake:::Hmmmmmm...
Cobbler::: WHAT?! NO—
Finn::: Alright! We're cobblers!
Cobbler::: No, you're not!! You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist!And don't try to cobble anything!
Jake:::What does "cobble" mean, anyway?
Finn::: I think it has something to do with shoes...
Fine Lady:::Excuse me! Can you help me? I need a broken heel fixed. I'm going to a fancy funeral.
Finn:::Of course I'll help!
Finn::: There!Whah!Pa-kow!!
Fine Lady::: Ah!
Finn::: Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!
Jake:::Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?
Finn::: Maybe...Whoa!
Jake::: Cool!
Fine Lady::: I cannot go to the funeral in these!
Cobbler:::Hey, everyone! I'm back from the doctor!WHY?! 
Fine Lady:::...And I'm not supposed to bring a guest.
Cobbler:::GET OUT!!
Finn::: Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent.
Jake::: Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're "sucking" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!
Finn:::Totes. I'll stop "pooping" my diaper.
Jake::: Whoa, what?!
Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button::: HELP! I NEED MEDICAL HELP!!
Finn::: Medical help? Hmmmmm...
Finn::: How can we help?
Lumpy Space Princess::: I want surgery to make my body hot.
Finn::: Yikes...
Lumpy Space Princess::: Yeah. I know I'm already pretty smokin'... but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body.
Jake:::You up for some serious plastic surgery?
Lumpy Space Princess::: Aw, yeah! This body's hot! And powerful!Huh?! Aw, what?! 
Jake::: Dude, did you use a magic nail again?
Finn::: I've got three left!
Lumpy Space Princess::: Ohhhh...What did you do to me??
Finn::: We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right?
Lumpy Space Princess::: No one thinks this look is hot!!
Cobbler:::Oh, my laces! You're the most beautiful— 
Lumpy Space Princess::: Huh?!
Finn::: ...Jake...?
Jake::: ....Yeah...?
Finn::: I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out...
Jake::: Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive!
Finn::: I just wanna sit here and moan.
Jake::: Then I'll moan with ya, buddy.
Finn:::Thaaaanks, buuuddy...
Jake:::Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome...
Old Lady::: AAAH! AAAH! HELP ME!!
Swamp Giant::: Hahaha! Relax! I'm just gonna grind you up!!
Old Lady::: AAAH! AAAH!
Jake:::Aw, man, this grass-bag again??HEY, EVIL-DOER!Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here.
Swamp Giant::: It's not evil!! When they get this old, they wanna be ground up!! Hahaha! Right, you old bat?!
Old Lady::: Help!!
Swamp Giant::: Right?!?
Old Lady::: Oooh!! Aaah!!
Finn::: Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm...
Swamp Giant:::Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!?
Finn:::WRONG!!!!I couldn't think of anything...
Old Lady::: Whooo! 
Finn::: POOP!! I saved her with violence...
Old Lady::: What's your huff, son?
Finn::: The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down.
Old Lady::: Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out! And you did it with violence! Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures!Just like I was born to be an old lady! Don't deny your rowdy nature, paladins!And don't take advice from old people! 
Finn::: Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point!
Jake::: Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo—
Finn::: It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!!
Jake::: Cha!!
Finn::: It's us again.
Jake::: And we've got exciting news!
Billy::: Aw, I don't—I don't wanna buy anything.
Finn::: Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns.
Billy::: Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead!
Jake::: She's right here. 
Old Lady::: Hello!
Finn::: We saved 'er, Billy.
Jake::: You saved 'er.
Finn::: I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these!And look how happy she is, man! She's elated!
Billy::: Hmm. Perhaps you're right.It's... it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being... You wanna watch?Nothung!Finn and Jake... truly, you are my heroes.Now you're freakin' me out... 
Jake::: We're his heroes!!
Billy::: Huh... Hello.
Jake::: Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!!
Billy::: Get outta here!!
