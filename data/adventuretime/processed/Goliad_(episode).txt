Jake::: What'ya building?
Finn::: Um, it's just a little stick fort.
Jake::: Oh, rad!
Jake::: Look. It's just my size.
Jake:::  Hey, get away from my fort, you big stinky monster!
Finn::: I like it when you get small, Jake.
Jake::: Yeah, me too.
Jake::: Whoa, whoa!
Finn:::Whoa, Peppermint Butler!
Peppermint Butler::: Finn, Jake, the Princess wants to see you.
Princess Bubblegum::: As princess of Candy Kingdom, I'm in charge of a lot of candy people. They rely on me. I can't imagine what might happen to them if I was gone. And after my brush with death at the hands of the Lich,I realized something.  I'm not gonna live forever Finn.  I would if I could.
Princess Bubblegum::: But modern science just isn't there yet.
Princess Bubblegum:::  So I engineered a replacement who can live forever.
Princess Bubblegum::: I call her... Goliad.
Finn & Jake:::  Wow!  Aww! She's cute.
Finn::: Hi, Goliad. I'm Finn.
Jake::: And I'm Jake.
Goliad::: Hi, Finn. Hi, Jake.
Finn::: Hi, Goliad.
Goliad:::  Hi, Finn.
Finn::: What did you use to make her?
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh, um...  Pretty standard candy creature soup.
Princess Bubblegum ::: Some acids.
Princess Bubblegum ::: Some algebra.
Princess Bubblegum:::  And I threw in one of my baby teeth so she had my DNA.
Finn & Jake::: Wow, DNA?!
Princess Bubblegum::: Yeah. All it takes is just one little tooth, or,  a single hair.
Princess Bubblegum::: It's all it takes.
Jake::: Princess Bubblegum, are you okay?
Princess Bubblegum::: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. Haven't slept for a solid 83 hours, but... yeah, I'm good.
Jake::: Aw, you should go to bed.
Princess Bubblegum::: I can't go to bed, Goliad has huge, mondo mama brains.
Princess Bubblegum::: I still need to fill them with knowledge...  about how to rule a kingdom. 
Finn::: What? Let us teach her.
Princess Bubblegum::: Uhh, okay. I guess that will be all right.
Finn & Jake:::  Yea!  Yeah! Teachers!  Yeah, woo-hoo!  Teach, teaching teachers.
Finn & Jake::: Woow, woow, woow!
Finn::: C'mon, Goliad.
Finn:::  See ya later, Princess! Get some sleep!
Princess Bubblegum::: Huh? Whu...? Bye guys...
Finn::: Look, Goliad. This is a preschool. I'm gonna set up some obstacles and all that for you to learn on, is that okay? 
Goliad::: Yeah, thanks Finn. I'm excited to learn.
Finn::: Okay, great. Jake, you go and get some kids from inside to help with the lesson and such.
Jake::: Okay. C'mon, Goliad.
Goliad::: Yes, Jake.
Jake::: Uhm...
Jake::: Uhh...
Red Gumball/Candy Child:::Stinking, durken...
Candy Nanny::: Now, now, settle down.
Goliad::: Jake, these kids seem pretty scary.
Jake:::Ah, nah, these kids ain't nothin'! Kids groove doozyploon! Check this out.
Jake::: Hey, there kids, who wants to play--
Jake::: Uhh, easy now children. Easy-
Peanut Child::: Get his brain! Get his brain!
Peanut Child::: Get his eyes!
Jake::: Listen up, you kids better stop donkin' around! You're gonna mess up Goliad!  It's my way or the highway, get it? I'm Don Juan Cherry Tempo! Now march, glib blobbit!
Jake::: Don't be acting all crazy.
Jake::: Wow, holy shmow!
Finn::: Oh, hey, y'all are just in time. You ready to pop this croc's back Dr. Goliad?
Goliad::: Yeah, I think so Finn. I've learned a real lot already so far. Sooo much... from Jake.
Jake::: Uh, you know, Finn... maybe this isn't such a good idea, actually.
Finn::: Oh, no, it's cool. I got helmets for everybody.
Finn::: Okay, Goliad, you ready to lead? 
Goliad::: Ready!
Finn::: Okay, in 3, 2, 1...  Go!
Goliad::: Alright, listen up! You kids better stop dunking around and get on that ramp!
Goliad::: You're gonna mess up Goliad! I'm Don Juan Cherry Temp—Cherry Tempo! It's my way or the highway, Glob-globbit!
Finn::: Stop stop! No, Goliad, no! Leading isn't about scaring people, you gotta stay calm and use your head. Use that beautiful brain, girlfriend.
Goliad::: My brain? Are you sure?
Finn::: Yeah! Don't be shy. Try it on me, lead me.
Goliad::: Okay, Finn.  Okay.
Finn:::No, Goliad, that's wrong, too.
Finn::: You can't just control people or whatever, it's messed up.
Goliad::: No, Finn. This way is good. Everyone did what I wanted. Really fast, no mistakes, calm like you said. This is definitely is the way to lead. Definitely.
Finn::: Um, no, no. ...Wait, is that true? 
Jake::: C'mon, Goliad. Let's go see Princess Bubblegum.
Finn::: Princess! Princess!
Jake::: Goliad's got mind control powers!
Finn::: She got the wrong idea about leadership!
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh, I was afraid this might happen. Where is she now?
Finn & Jake:::  She's chilling in the garden!  We left her outside the garden!
Princess Bubblegum::: Hello, Goliad.
Goliad::: Hello, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum::: I hear that you learned a lot today.
Goliad::: Yes, I led the children.
Princess Bubblegum::: But Finn said you used yelling and mind control.
Goliad::: Yes, it was good.
Princess Bubblegum::: Goliad,  let me tell you about leadership. You see this fat bee? It's gentle  and makes the flower happy, and pollinated. They both get what they need... ...and that's how leaders should be.
Goliad::: No, Princess. Bee cares not for flower. If getting pollen hurts or kills flower, bee would not care.  Bee is stronger than flower.
Goliad::: Goliad is stronger than bee.  Goliad is stronger than all.
Princess Bubblegum:::  Oh, no. She's too far gone, too corrupted. If we're not careful, she can throw an ultra-tantrum and wind the castle apart. I will have to disassemble her and try again.
Goliad::: No, Princess. This is my castle now.
Finn::: Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!
Princess Bubblegum::: No, Finn. She's far too powerful. Here's the plan::: I'm going to build another Candy Sphinx in my lab. It's the only thing that can possibly match her. Just keep her busy 'til I return.  And don't think about the plan! She can read your minds!
Jake:::  Ugh, eyeball... Just tuck that eyeball back in its hole.
Finn::: Goliad, no!
Finn:::  Jake, don't swallow!
Finn::: Uhh, you're in Finn's bubble.
Finn:::  Don't think of the plan... Think of something else. Think of something else.
Finn ::: Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!
Princess Bubblegum ::: No, Finn, she's too—
Princess Bubblegum ::: Anyway, like I was saying, she's far too powerful—
Princess Bubblegums::: Finn, she's far too powerful. Here's the plan.
Baby Finns::: I'm a buff baby that can dance like a man.I can shake-ah my fanny, I can shake-ah my—Ahh!
Princess Bubblegum ::: Here's the plan. I'm going to—
Princess Bubblegum ::: Goliad! No!
Goliad::: Wait, brother, why must we fight? Rule with me!
Goliad::: No, brother! Don't you see? They're turning us against--
Goliad::: So be it.
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn, are you okay?
Finn::: Yeah, that dude saved me.
Princess Bubblegum::: That's Stormo, Goliad's new brother.
Finn::: Wha-- What are they doing now?
Princess Bubblegum::: They're about to have a psychic showdown.
Jake::: Wow, man, so, like... I guess they're so evenly matched that it's a stale—  It's a stale— 
Finn::: They're so evenly matched that it's a stalemate!
Princes Bubblegum::: Yes. Stormo sacrificed himself to keep Goliad in check for all eternity.
Finn::: Well, that's pretty cool, but... I don't understand. If Goliad and Stormo are the same, how come Stormo is a good guy?
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh, that's simple::: I used some of your heroic DNA in Stormo's recipe and not Goliad's.
Finn::: Oh, whoa so, that means Stormo is like... my son?
Princess Bubblegum::: Well, yeah... in a way.
Finn::: Happy birthday, Stormo.
