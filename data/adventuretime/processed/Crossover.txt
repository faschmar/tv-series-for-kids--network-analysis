Finn:::Wow, everything sucks here!
Jake:::Finn, look!
Finn:::Oh jeez, this looks pretty real.He's got the Enchiridion!And, wait, is that Billy? Why is he so tiny?
Jake::: Hey, there's our guy!
Farmworld/Ice Finn::: WOOHOO! HAHAHAHAHAHA!Yeah, just hang out there for a while! I love it! I feel fresh, hahahahahaha!
Finn::: Well, this is the weirdest thing I've ever done. 
Finn, Jake, and BMO:::Round and round and round we go!
BMO:::Hiya!
Finn and Jake::: Oh yeah!
BMO::: School's out 'ya trench!
Jake:::Woah!Oof!
Finn:::Hey, Prismo's calling!
Jake:::Nice! Let's go say hi.
BMO:::You're lucky I don't take you out, kid!Quit crying baby!
Finn and Jake::: PRRRIIIIIIISSSSSMM- 
BMO::: Oof!
Finn and Jake::: OOOOOO!
Finn:::TION!
Prismo:::Thanks for responding to my call, guys! I'm in a serious pickle, and I mean the brown kind. I mean like a really smelly, brown pickle.
Jake:::Don't sweat it, boy! Finn and I got yo' back!
Finn::: Who's bullying you Prismo?!
Prismo:::Nobody's bullying me. Look, um, remember when you wished the lich never existed and you created a new wish reality that ended up totally not working out?
Finn:::No.
Jake:::Vaguely, yes.
Finn:::What?
Jake:::You don't remember making that wish!
Finn:::Wu-huh?
Jake:::I thought I explained it to you that one time.
Prismo:::Dude, I'll catch you up.Look!After you wished the lich never existed, you accidentally created an alternate wish reality where magic doesn't really exist.
Finn:::Wait! . Who's that dude?
Prismo:::That's you! But sort of less cool.
Finn:::Uh-huh, proceed.
Prismo:::So you find an old Marceline and the crown on the body of Ice King's skeleton who was smushed under the weight of a frozen mitogenic bomb. But then the destiny gang steals your family donkey, so you use the crown to become Ice Finn and save your donkey and your family. But, the crown makes you crazy, and you ice everything up like a dumb bozo, which sets off the mitogenic bomb, which releases the spirit of the lich anyway. But then, this reality's Jake made a counter wish which supposedly fixed the problem, but as it turned out, it didn't really.
Finn:::Can I just say that I don't remember any of this stuff.
Prismo:::Because technically it didn't happen to you. But, also it still happened, and that wish reality continues to exist.
Finn:::Is this why all of a sudden one day I was better at the flute.
Jake:::Oh yeah, I noticed that!
Prismo:::Listen! Something, really bad, is about to go down.Ice Finn is using his world's Enchiridion to build a portal to the multiverse. I literally do not know what will happen if he succeeds, but it could def's be catastrophic to the architecture of these realities. Now if that happens, my boss, let me repeat that, my BOSS will hold ME responsible, and by proxy, y'all both be in the dip too.
Finn:::Why don't you just bloop bloop it all better?
Prismo:::Something there is dampening my powers. I AM LOSING MY PICS OVER THIS BIZ!
Jake::: His boss! Who's that?
Finn:::Alright, man, what do we do? 
Prismo:::Take this, and use it to take care of the Ice Finn.
Finn:::Oh, wait what do you mean by take care o-
Prismo:::Good luck guys we're all depending on you! 
Finn::: Woah.
Jake:::What is it?
Finn::: Oh golly!
Jake::: What's that thing now?
Finn:::It's like 50 bowling balls on my teen bod! Oh, check it! There's instructions.The maid will handle all Class A interdimensional Bung-ups if you follow these simple steps::: direct the small end of the Maid towards your massive mistake . Focus your intention until all distractions leave your thought sphere . Then recite the words "A man needs a maid" three times. Alright . Here we go!Help help help help help help help! 
Jake:::Lower it!
Finn:::Ledge ledge ledge!Ok! Focus my intention. 
Farmworld/Ice Finn:::Just a few more jewels before I can open the portal to a better world!
Finn:::My intention to heal the madness of this other self.
Jake:::Wait, wait, wait. I don't think that's what we're supposed to do. Prismo said take care of him.
Finn:::Yeah, that means make him feel better.
Jake:::Are you being stupid on purpose?
Finn:::Yeah, but dude, that is me!
Finn Sword:::That's me!
Jake:::I heard you the first time!
Finn:::There's gotta be something else we can do.
Jake:::Bro, you heard Prismo, we don't have a choice.
Finn::: Ok, but you do it! I just can't man i- it's too messed up.
Jake:::Alright, you're right. Shut your eyes and cover your ears!
Finn::: Mamamamamamama.
Jake::: A man needs a maid .A man... needs... a maid. A maaaaan , needs... a... . Nope! This is bull juice!
Prismo::: Oh, flip!
Finn:::Mamamamama-
Jake:::hey, hey!
Finn:::Did you do it?
Jake:::Nah man! Let's just go steal the Enchiridion.
Finn:::Woah yeah! That way he can't open the portal and nobody gets obliterated!That should work!
