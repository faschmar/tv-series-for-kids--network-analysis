Sweet P:::Yesh, dahd! 
Tree Trunks:::Okay, there's your lunch and an apple for the teacher. 
Tree Trunks::: Golly, it's awful nice of y'all to take Sweet P to school on his first day.
Finn:::Our pleas', T.T.!
Jake::: Yeah, first day of school can be real tough. We wouldn't want Sweet P freaking out or awakening any latent evil spirits within himself! 
Mr. Pig::: Well, we're gonna miss you, son. 
Jake:::You think he's still secretly evil, that he's still all "Lich-y" in there?
Finn::: Mm, not sure.
Jake::: I don't know, Finn, he just seems so... sweet! 
Finn:::Mm.
Mr. Pig & Tree Trunks:::Bye!
Sweet P::: Bye!
Mr. Pig & Tree Trunks::: 
Jake:::So far so good. 
Finn::: Fat squirrel in trub! Gah!Oh, no! 
Jake::: Wait, Finn. Let's just see how this plays out.

Jake::: Daww!
Finn::: Hmm...
Finn::: Alright, welp, see you later, Sweet P! 
Jake::: Bye. 
Sweet P::: Bye, Teddy-Man.
Kid 1::: Hey, Baby-Man! Did your grandma knit your clothes?
Sweet P::: Yeah, and she's my mom! 
Kid 1::: Why are you laughing, Baby-Man? You're not even a real kid!
Sweet P::: Huh?!
Kid 1::: You're nothing but a big, weird baby-man!Baby-Man!
Sweet P::: 
King of Ooo::: Let's see what we got here. Hello there. Intimidated by those bullies, eh?
Sweet P::: Uh, yeah.
King of Ooo::: What's your name, kid?
Sweet P::: Sweet P!
King of Ooo::: I'm the one true King of Ooo. This is my attorney, Toronto. Sweet P, there are all kinds of education, you know.
Sweet P::: No?
King of Ooo::: Yes, sir, all kinds! Such as... dancing. You could blow off this podunk school and get a proper dance education! Then you can come back and really show those mean kids and make your parents proud!
Toronto::: Hey, King of Ooo!
King of Ooo::: Yes, Toronto?
Toronto::: You are a certified dance instructor, right? Show the kid the dance you do.
King of Ooo::: Nooo, that dance is too tough for an amateur!
Toronto::: Aw, come on. You gotta show the kid. It's awesome!
King of Ooo::: Yeah, I know it's awesome, but I really don't think the kid is ready.
Toronto::: Ready?
King of Ooo::: I don't think he's tough enough to be ready.
Sweet P::: I'm tough enough to be ready!
Toronto::: See?! The kid is tough... and ready!
Sweet P:::Please?! 
King of Ooo::: Aah, I do see it!
Sweet P:::Eee!
King of Ooo::: You've got a good eye, and you're a good dog!Watch this, kid. 
Sweet P::: Ahh! 
King of Ooo::: Well, we got us a prodigy here. You're ready for advanced classes.Hey, you mugs, wanna see some world-class dancing? Just turn around!
Candy Person 1::: Ah, leave me alone!
Candy Person 2::: Leave me alone, too.
Candy Person 3::: I'm turning around! 
Toronto::: Teeth! 
King of Ooo:::Ha, ya did great!
Toronto::: You should come back tomorrow, kid, for more dancin' lessons!
King of Ooo::: Have a gold star!Show that to your parents, kid. They'll love it! But... don't tell 'em where you got it, or you'll ruin the surprise. Just think how proud they'll be at your big, uhh, end-of-the-year recital! You understand?
Toronto::: Of course Sweet P understands; he's a good boy!
Sweet P::: A good boy! 
Mr. Pig::: So, how was school?
Tree Trunks::: Yes, how'd ya do?A gold star?!
Mr. Pig::: I'm gonna put this where we can see it every day.Thumbs up!
Tree Trunks::: Thumbs up! Come on, thumbs up! 
Sweet P::: Thumbs up! 
King of Ooo::: Thumbs up!
Toronto::: Thumbs up!
King of Ooo::: Well, this is our place.
Toronto:::We'd invite you in, but the place is a mess.
King of Ooo::: He's right; we're filthy. Listen, we all need a break. Go on home, kid, and we'll see you tomorrow!
Sweet P::: Mm!
Tree Trunks::: Sweet P, uh, we're going on a date. You're smart and educated enough to stay at home all by yourself.
Mr. Pig::: The proof is on the fridge! 
Sweet P::: Mama and Papa will be so surprised if the refrigerator is all covered with stars when they get back. One more star should do it. I need to find King of Ooo and Toronto to get me that last star.
Toronto::: I don't know, K.O, they've gone rancid.
King of Ooo::: Horse feathers! A lick of gold paint is all it needs!Just a couple more garbage stars, eh, Toronto?
Toronto::: Mo' stars means mo' dosh!
King of Ooo::: Soon we'll have enough scratch to fund my big comeback! This kid is great at helping us rob people!
Toronto::: And best of all, he doesn't know a thing! Because if he did...
King of Ooo & Toronto::: We'd have to take care of him!
Toronto::: What was that?! 
King of Ooo::: Sweet P? What did you hear?
Toronto::: What does it matter?! None of it was good!
King of Ooo::: We gotta take care of him.
Sweet P::: Aaa! 
King of Ooo::: I shouldn't have said that out loud.
Sweet P:::Mom, Dad! 
King of Ooo::: Hey, kid! Toronto and I talked it over, and we decided that we're not going to"Take care of you."
Toronto::: We're going to burn down your orchard! 
Sweet P:::Nooo!
King of Ooo::: Yup, we're gonna burn it down—unless...
Sweet P::: Unless?
King of Ooo::: You leave home and your loving parents and come dance with us forever.
Toronto::: Forever!
Sweet P::: No! No, no, no, no, no! 
King of Ooo::: Come on, Sweet P. The people love you!
Sweet P::: They do?
King of Ooo::: Well, mostly they love to laugh at you. I mean, look at yourself. You're a— a— a big, weird baby-man! 
Toronto::: Baby-Man, Baby-Man 
Sweet P:::Stop. 
Lich/Sweet P::: I have learned much from you. Thank you, my teachers. And now for your... education.
