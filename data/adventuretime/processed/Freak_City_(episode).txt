Finn::: Walking, walking, walking – hambone break! 
Jake::: WooHoo! Hey!
Jake::: Get away from me. Quit it. 
Off screen::: Food for a beggar…
Man::: Food for a poor old man? 
Jake::: Whoa!
Finn::: Geez Louise, guy
Man::: So you got any, kid? Food? 
Finn::: I got this little piece of sugar.Nuts, I'm freaking all about sugar. But I am even more about feeding hobos! 
Jake::: Whoa, man. Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is wrong thing to do.
Finn::: Why?
Jake::: I don't know. I said "Maybe" 
Finn::: A hero always helps someone in need and besides he's probably a secret elf who will reward us for being nice. Here you go, buddy. 
Man:::You know, believe or not, I'm not really a beggar. I'm actually a…Magic Man!
Finn and Jake:::Whoa!
Finn::: Aw, yeah!
Jake::: He's magic! I didn't expect this.
Magic Man:::Magic.... Away! 
Jake:::Think happy thoughts… Little, cute, bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies.
Finn::: what is wrong with you, Magic Man?!
Magic Man::: You gave me that candy now I'll do you a favor in return. A magic favor.A mystical, magical favor! 
Jake:::Whoa, dude!
Magic Man::: ...For you!
Finn::: why did you do that!?
Magic Man::: Because on this day, a magical life lesson comes to you.
Finn::: No! Change me back.
Magic Man::: Not until you appreciate what a jerk I am. Wazoo! 
Jake::: What a nutty guy
Finn::: What the heck, man?? What kind of deal is that? I help somebody out and they make me a stinky foot.
Jake:::You smell pretty good.
Finn:::Get off of me, man! I can't be a hero if I'm a big good-smelling foot!
Jake::: Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong. Now that you're a huge foot you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard. You're 100% kick, man!
Finn::: Why are you being so level-headed about this?
Jake::: Don't be a siss, Finn. Here, c'mon kick my butt. 
Finn::: You're the SISS, siss! Augh! 
Jake:::Ouch! oooh! Ouch. See, man. Let's give your foot body a shot.
Finn:::No, dude! I wanna go find that magic man and get my body back!
Jake:::Shhh shhh shhh shhh. Just be a foot for a little bit 
Jake as Finn::: Ok, I will.
Jake::: Awesome! Dude you will never regret this. Hahaha!
Jake::: Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch!
Finn::: This sucks, dude.
Jake:::Shhh!
Monster:::<nowiki>We're evil!Our crotch! our evil crotch!!</nowiki>
Jake:::Hahaha! What'd I tell you? You're a great hero! Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes.
Finn::: No, Jake. Let's find that Magic Man.
Jake::: Finn, being an enormous crotch-kicking foot is a gift. Don't scorn a gift.
Jake::: Town on fire! This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability!
Finn::: But I-I can't even bend these big fat toes, man.
Jake::: You can do it, Finn. What'd I teach you, dude?
Finn:::Not to scorn the kicking of people in the crotch?
Jake::: You got it! Now I'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town--only the babies.Get your hero on, dude!
Finn::: Aaahh!
Finn::: Uhh. Okay, you can do this, Finn.Start small, man. I'm taking you down! 
Finn:::It's hot! Oh, man, I'm smoking hot! Please, help me out! I can't move!
Townsperson (red shirt)::: It's another one of those freaks!
Townsperson (green shirt)::: He probably started this fire!
Finn::: No, I didn't start any –
Townsperson (blue shirt)::: Throw him under the bridge with the others!
Townspeople (all)::: Get rid of the freak.Freak! Freak!
Finn::: Unh!I'm not a freak, I'm a hero.
Jake::: Finn!
Finn::: Jake, how'd you find me?
Jake::: Oh, I can sense when you're about to cry. It's like a mother/daughter thing.
Finn:::I'm not going to cry, man! I just feel like crying. We have to find that magic guy andget my body back now!
Jake::: What we have to do is find out what reeks under this bridge 
Finn::: Jake!
Jake::: Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell.
Finn::: Get back here!
Jake::: Ugh, it—it smells like vomit on fire. It's like fancy cheese in an old guy's mouth.
Cyclops::: Welcome, travelers.
Jake::: Ahh!
Cyclops::: I am Gork, leader of Freak City. Ah, I can see one of you has felt the Magic Man's touch. 
Finn::: Yeah! You know that guy?
Gork::: I will tell you all that I know.
Gork::: We are the accursed ones, all once normal guys and gals who crossed paths with the Magic Man.That's Zap, the Arm.Trudy, the Waist.That's Wee Wee and Gorflax.They were turned into tonsils and that's Kim.But, please, make yourselves at home. Would you like something to drink?
Jake::: Do you have any orange juice?
Gork::: No.Well, uh, I don't know. Maybe. Uh, I don't think so. I'll go check.
Jake::: Yo, Finn, this place is really bumming me out. Let's get out of here.
Finn::: What?! No, dude. These guys might be my only hope of finding the Magic Man.
Gork::: Hey, we actually do have orange juice.
Finn::: Thanks for being cool and all, but what do you know about this Magic Man? How do we catch him?
Gork::: Oh, he can't be caught. He's got magic and we're worthless freaks. We can't ever beat him. So we've gather here to wallow in our self-pity.
Finn::: But don't y'all even want to try?
Kim::: Eh, no.
Finn::: Why not? You're all totally miserable here.
Zap::: Ugh. It's a living.
Finn::: No, it's not, Zap! It's not a living! It's dookie diapers! I don't want to be a foot!
Trudy::: Well, get used to it. We did.
Jake::: Yeah, Finn, maybe there's another lesson to be learned here--
Jake::: To accept what fate has given youand stay a miserable foot. Gork, can we stay here in this pile of trash and rats forever?
Gork::: Yeah, man. Do it up.
Jake:::Awesome.Here we go.
Finn::: Jake, stop screwing around.You're gonna make me give into depression.
Jake:::Eh, what are you going to do about it? Probably nothing, right? If you're depressed, you'll do nothing. 
Finn::: I…Maybe I will do nothing.] Maybe I'll just lay down here.Lay down –uh —and rot like the rest of you.
Jake:::Yeah!Stay a foot! Stay a foot! Stay a foot!
Finn:::Is this really my life?
Finn::: Get up, Gork!
Gork::: Huh? Why?
Finn:::I'm not gonna let you lie here,
Gork::: Whoa. Okay man, just be cool.
Finn:::And I'm not gonna be cool!
Jake::: Hey, Finn.
Finn:::Ja-a-a-ke, stop tellin' me to enjoy, bein' a foot, and get out of that trash! 
Jake::: Heh heh. I can't take you seriously when you're singing, man.
Finn::: Get up!
Jake::: Ahh!
Finn::: All of you make me sick!
Gork::: Wait, Finn!
Gork::: Hey, stop it, man!We don't like touching each other.
Finn::: Huh?
Gork::: Please, man.
Finn::: Wait a second. Kim, get underneath Trudy.
Kim::: No, man. Please. I freakin' hate Trudy.
Finn:::Kim, I will destroy you!
Kim::: Okay, Okay! 
Jake::: Yeah, do it, Kim.
Finn::: Yes! Now for meLook at us!
Jake::: Whoa!
Gork::: We're like a big, normal guy.
Kim::: Thank you so much
Zap::: We are perfect together
Kim::: Oh, Finn, thank you.
Finn::: Word! Now let's go wreck up that Magic Man!
Jake::: Let me get in on this. I'll form the pants. 
Magic Man::: Food. Food for a beggar
Magic Man::: Y'all got any food?
Gork::: We've got a little orange juice left over from – Wait a second…
Magic Man::: That's right. It is I, the magic Man!Zap
Magic Man::: Come on, apple grease! What are you gonna do?
Magic Man::: Ohh!
Zap::: We're not afraid.
Magic Man::: Are you sure about that?
Finn::: You're darn right we are!
Finn::: Give us our bodies back!
Magic Man::: Why should I? You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want.
Finn::: Oh. You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything return. I should've given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward.
Magic Man::: Wrong! 
Finn::: Ah, geez!
Jake:::Finn!
Finn:::You've gifted us nothing but heartache, Magic Man! What is the life lesson in that?!
Magic Man:::Yes, my children, you are so close to the answer.
Finn::: Answer this!
Kim::: Get his eyes! Cut him in the eyes!
Finn::: I wish I'd never been nice to you 'cause you're just a big jerk!
Magic Man::: Oh, yes, that's it!You've finally learned your lesson.And now I'm off spread my teachings to more sissy do-gooders.You're welcome!
Finn::: Man, I frickin' hate that guy. But at least now we can all go back to our regular lives.
Gork::: Well, actually, we like being like this
Zap::: Yeah, we're strong together
All::: Bye, Finn! Thank you!
Finn::: Oh, okay. Bye, guys. See you, later.Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned?
Jake:::Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks.
Finn::: Speaking of jerks, what the blubbins, man?! Why wouldn't you help me turn back into a boy?!
Jake::: Well, because I kind of always wanted 
Finn::: What?
Jake:::I said, I kind of always wanted to be a foot myself.
Finn::: You could be a foot right now. I saw you change into a foot twice yesterday.
Jake::: It's complicated, man. You'll understand when you're older.
