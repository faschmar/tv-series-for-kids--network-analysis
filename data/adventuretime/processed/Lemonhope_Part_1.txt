Earl of Lemongrab:::Hello! And keep away from Castle Lemongrab!
Lemongrab:::How are you today? Mm, I see. Yes. I'm inside my fortified totalitarian city-state. Hello, I'm Lemongrab.
Lemongrab 2::: Me too!
Lemongrab 2:::Ow!
Lemongrab:::Mm. Unacceptable.
Lemongrab:::Things have never been better here at Castle Lemongrab.
Lemongrab:::I have never been fatter.
Lemongrab:::And since the expulsion of Lemonhope...
Lemongrab:::We have reached peak societal obediency.
Lemongrab:::Law, order...
Lemongrab:::Harp-smashing.
Lemongrab:::We've have it all!
Lemongrab:::Mm, the pleasure. Smash another! Ooh, who is this?
Lemongrab::: I'm one of my subjects! I'm being punished for helping Lemonhope. But that's okay! 
Lemongrab:::Yes, morale has never been higher since we got rid of hope. In conclusion, no one needs to come here ever, especially Lemonhope, and I ate my brother. Goodbye!
Lemongrab 2:::Save us, Lemonhope! You're our only lemon-ho—!
Princess Bubblegum:::Lights on.Oh, Lemonhope, were you even paying attention?
Lemonhope:::Mmmmmm, yes. 
Princess Bubblegum:::I know this is a lot to take in, but one day, saving those lemons is going to be your responsibility. They're in trouble, and you need to work harder at this.
Lemonhope:::Eh...I don't know. I'm not too worried about other people, I guess. Like, I got me, and they got them. Mm.
Princess Bubblegum:::O-kay... Let's try something else.These are cupcakes.
Finn:::Cup-cups!
Princess Bubblegum:::Lemonhope,you have two cupcakes. Finn has no cupcakes. Lemonhope, will you give Finn one of your cupcakes?
Lemonhope:::Um...
Finn::: Yes.
Lemonhope:::Oh... but I don't want to! I want both cupcakes. Finn can get his own cupcakes! 
Princess Bubblegum::: Maybe we need something more hands-on. Hey, Finn, listen, that's it for class today.
Finn:::Whoop!Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop...
Princess Bubblegum::: But read the next three chapters of your geometry text! Well, at least he's street-smart.Okay, dude, we're going on a field-trip.
Princess Bubblegum:::This is the Lemon Earldom perimeter. Unfortunately, there are pacts and treaties preventing me from getting any closer. We should cloak.I know you don't like thinking about Castle Lemongrab, but it's where your family is. They set you free, and now they're being punished for it. It rips. Look!
Lemon Person:::Remember, Lemonhope!
Lemongrab:::I'm going to eat you!
Lemongrab:::I did it!
Princess Bubblegum:::D'ya see? They helped you. You have to help them now. It's your responsibility.
Lemonhope:::No! I don't have to do anything that I don't want to. They set me free, and free means I decide what I do, not them and not you!
Princess Bubblegum:::Dude, I'm sorry, but that attitude is unacceptable—oh! I mean...Lemonhope?
Lemonhope:::Lemonhope's got feet that take him to fun.Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun.Lemonhope's got no future plans, fully undeterred. No shirts,no pants,no "won't"s,no "can't"s.
Lemonhope:::My body's free like a li'l baby bird. Caw! Lemonhope's got legs that'll strut hot struts. Lemonhope's got thighs that'll pump both butts. He's... got a harp, s'got a flute, free to strum,free to toot! Free from PB-gum, I'm a lemon offreedom!Oh. It's warm.
Pirate:::Pick it up, you chumps! We've got to make Deaveston by brunch.
Lemonhope:::Oh, man, that thing looks just lousy with freedom... straight-up right out the diddle-doo, comin' at ya right straight up. Ha-ha!
Lemonhope:::Yeah, exactly.A-ha-ha-ha!Wha-a-at? Okay...It takes all kinds, I guess! 
Pirate:::Argh! A Greed Lard!
Lemonhope::: Oh, my fontanelle. Hello? I—I accidentally came on to your boat,but—but I think I really need some help.
Lemongrab 2:::Hey. Hey, guy. Back here.
Lemongrab 2:::Hey, c'mon, I've fallen off back there. Guy? Hey, buddy.
Princess Bubblegum:::Psst. Down here.
Princess Bubblegum:::Psst. Lemonhope, it's me. You are... You are unacceptable!
Lemongrab 2:::Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy...
Lemonhope::: A lot of nightmares again. I guess that's freedom for you. Oh.
Lemonhope::: Mm.Thirsty.Nothing like juice for breakfast.Oh. I guess that's the rest of those.Well, I guess if there's no juice, I got freedom to go find water. 
Lemonhope:::Huh. Weird cloud's still there.Couldn't rain a little, could ya? Huh, cloud? Eh, what are you gonna do? Freedom not to rain, I guess. 
Lemonhope::: Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun. My lemon of...freedom!
