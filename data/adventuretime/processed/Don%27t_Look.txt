Jake:::Hmm.'Make more friends with sing-talking.'Hey there, Finn! Whatcha reading?
Finn:::It's a manuscript about "The Legend of Dead Mountain." Supposedly, if you get to the top, there's a treasure that will change you into the person you always wanted to be.
Jake:::Ha, that's a dumb story; I love dumb stories! What would you change about yourself if you got that treasure? Fix your weird cursed grass arm so it wouldn't be weird and cursed?
Finn:::Nah. I'd like to be taller.
Jake:::How tall we talking about?
Finn:::I don't know. Like, couple of inches. Say...tall as Princess Bubblegum?
Jake::: Oh, I see.
Finn:::Jake, how would you change yourself on Dead Mountain if only the legends were true?
Jake::: I wouldn't change anything; I'm the whole package.Whoa!
Finn::: Hey! There's a big warning about Dead Mountain in here. See?It says some kind of evil hermit guards the mountaintop.'Don't let him look at you or something horrible will happen.' That seals the deal. The twin temptations of getting to grow a couple of inches and battling an evil hermit sound like a pretty perfect day. Let's go!
Turtle Princess:::Shh!
Finn::: Let's go.
Finn and Jake::: Gear up for battle! You smell like cattle! Gear up for battle! You smell... Like cattle!
Finn:::Monsters that get you by looking at you are so doomb. 
Jake:::Everybody knows all you need is a mirror.
Finn:::They ought to get a new gimmick.There's the evil hermit's uh... what is that? A hut?
Jake:::No, it's a yurt.
Finn and Jake:::Yah! Rats!
Finn::: Is that the hermit?We don't get to fight the hermit.
Jake:::Hey look.
Finn:::What is it, boy?
Jake:::The treasure. Okay, here it goes.Oh great treasure, make my taste buds think they're tasting fried chicken even when I eat my fruits and vegetables. I don't have any fruits or vegetables on me. I guess I'll find out later if that worked. Your turn.
Finn::: Oh great treasure, I want to be approximately 11.5 inches taller.Gross! It's leaking!
Jake:::This place is depressing.
Finn:::And I'm not growing taller. There's nothing going on here. ON TOP OF DEAD MOUNTAIN! 
Jake:::We should have known better than to trust a book.
Finn:::Yeah. He makes one cool skeleton, though.These shades...Let me check out these shades.Aah! Ohh! 
Jake:::Finn! 
Finn:::Huh? Jake? 
Jake:::You're awake! Oh, I was so worried. I've been waiting with a bowl of soup. It has hoops and loops and maybe some goop.
Finn::: What happened? I don't remember getting into bed. 
Jake:::Don't worry. You're gonna be fine...in no time.
Finn:::Thanks for taking care of me. You're the greatest big brother ever.W-Why are you doing that?
Jake:::I'm not.
BMO:::You're awake! You want some tea? Or saltine crackers?
Finn:::BMO, you're my little angel.
BMO:::I'm a real boy!With wings!And a halo!Oh!
Finn:::What's happening?
Jake:::I don't know but it probably has something to do with your weird old eyes.
Finn::: Something is wrong with my eyes?
Finn:::Aah! Hermit eyes! Dead-hermit eyes!
Jake:::Heh, it's fine.
Finn:::Do you think the hermit did this... to punish me for grabbing his shades?
Jake:::I think maybe the eyes are the treasure.
Finn:::So, then, am I making people what they want to be?
Jake:::No, because I don't want to be this awesome sweater bro. But maybe that's how you see me.
Shelby:::Hey dudes. Nice eyes, Finn. What's the word? What's the haps?What's your major?
Jake:::Whoa! Do you see Shelby as a bookish nerd?
Shelby:::You're a nerd.
Finn:::I don't know, maybe. Is that bad?
Finn:::Hello? ... Hiya, P.B. What's up? ... You need help with your speech? ... An emergency?! ... On our way.Let's roll, varsity Jake.
Jake:::Ah ah. Before we go...Until you figure out how to use them, keep those peepers covered.
Princess Bubblegum::: What to wear for my speech...Boss next door or hot president?
Finn:::Is this what you needed help with?
Princess Bubblegum:::No, I think I got this. Oh! Hi Finn and Jake. You guys look...cool. You trying out a new look?Anyways, I'm preparing for a very important speech about the benefits of candying vegetables, and I need you guys to take care o-o-o-o-o-ofthat.
Finn:::Help Starchy set up chairs?
Princess Bubblegum:::No no no. That.
Finn:::Oh boy. We're on it, princess. 
Princess Bubblegum:::It's probably nothing. He's been good lately, but it's a big speech, you know.
Ice King::: Ohh. Ah.
Finn and Jake:::Hey Ice King!
Ice King:::Aah! I'm not doing anything wrong. I was just lady-watching.Ow!
Finn:::Oh no.
Ice King (appearing as Simon):::Where'd my muscles go?! I'm a scrawny-armed loser!
Jake:::That's how you see him? That's beautiful.
Finn:::Sure, I-I mean it's... It's hard not to sometimes. Where'd those glasses go?
Jake:::There.
Finn:::Starchy! Give those back, you thief!
Starchy::: Huh? No way! Starchy looks good!
Finn:::Starchy, you butt! 
Starchy::: Ohh!
Finn:::Oof, sorry.
Princess Bubblegum:::What's going on here?Can you explain this?
Finn:::I don't know. I'm not a psychiatrist!
Jake:::Come on, let's get you home, dude. Peebs, good luck with the speech.
Princess Bubblegum:::But... Teen boy heartthrob it is.
Jake:::Okay, at least now we're safe from you donking up any more of our friends. 
Finn:::Nobody got hurt.
Neptr:::Have any of you guys seen BMO?
Finn:::Aah! Did I kill Neptr?! 
Jake:::You turned him into a microwave. So...yeah, you kind of did.
Finn:::But... but... but... That's not how I see Neptr, is it? I like Neptr. He's like my half-son. If I was a better person, would I be turning my friends into better things? Am I uncaring, judgmental...
Jake:::Uh, Finn.
Finn:::Self-centered? Monstrous? I'm... I'm... I'm a huge wa-a-a-a-a-d!
Jake:::Finn! You're being melodramatic!
Finn:::I know it's you.
Jake:::Hey, buddy. I figured you'd come back here.
Finn:::Don't look at me, Jake. I might turn you into a microwave.
Jake:::Baloney! You turned Neptr into a microwave because he's a microwave. But that doesn't mean that's all he is to you. I know you think Neptr is an interesting person, and I know that "microwave" is just one part of his personality. I mean...maybe your eyes are just bad at describing things, you know? Like how you feel about people, what they mean to you... That stuff's in your guts. Eyes can't grok that... Unless you have the eyes of like a trained artist or something. But you don't. I'm telling you, man::: you're not a bad dude like this skeleton bro, or you'd be turning everyone into rats and plops. Now come on. Look at me.
Finn:::Jake, you're so wise.
Jake:::What?! Di- Wha... Well, at least you're listening to me. And wise old Jakey got a plan.P.B., you want to go first?
Princess Bubblegum:::He may not be the most cunning soldier, but one thing about Finn is that he always puts other people first, and that makes him a true hero.
Starchy:::Finn helped Starchy fart once.
Shelby:::What a life saver.
Ice King (appearing as Simon):::Finn's a mean old party pooper.Ow! But he is the hottest guy in Ooo, so he can kind of do what he wants. 
Jake:::Finn's just the best guy to do bro stuff with, like lying on the grass and talking to bugs or baking chocolate chip cookies. Finn's just a good friend.
Finn:::I'm me again. These balls are going nuts.Uh... My son.
Neptr:::Eye pie!
Everyone:::Ew. 
Finn:::Good job, Neptr. You saved the day.Neptr! Neptr!
Everyone:::Neptr! Neptr! Neptr! Neptr! Yay!
BMO:::I just had the most wonderful dream.
