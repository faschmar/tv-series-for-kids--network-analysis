Princess Bubblegum:::Alright, guys. Hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole. I've gotta jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk.
Finn::: You got it, Princess.
Jake::: Whatever you want, mama.
Princess Bubblegum::: Bubblegum, away!!
Jake::: Ow. Ow. Ow.
Finn::: There. That's the last sign, Jake. Now no one will go down this hole, ever. Probably a lot of dangerous, awesome stuff down this hole. I better go take a look.
Jake::: Don't, dude. For you see, that's the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye!
Finn::: Whoa.
Jake::: Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon. Man, we shouldn't even be talkin' about it, 'cause it's lunch time. 
Finn::: The crystal eye. I wanna meet this dungeon.
Jake::: Maybe after lunch.
Finn::: Eh, I'll skip lunch. Just catch up with me when you are finished.
Jake::: *Pfft* Yeah, right.
Finn::: What?
Jake::: Without the aid of my magnificent powers......Huh? Huh? You'd get killed down there.
Finn::: Hey! I can do things without you! You wanna bet I can't?
Jake::: Nope. Come get your sandwich.Listen to Jake, Finn. He only wants what's best for--Ahh! Help me! Ahh! Come put her out of her misery, dude!
Finn::: We are betting! I bet that I'll get that crystal eye and be back within 11 minutes.Ready set go! 
Jake:::I better go after him.
Jake ::: No, Jake! Stay here, with me...
Jake::: Oh, my... 
Finn::: Dungeons! Chambers! Woah.Evil creatures!Treasure chests! 
Finn::: Doorways!Traps!I'm in my elemeeeeeeeeent!! 
Finn::: Aww!
Finn:::Oh?
Finn::: Whoa! Somebody come pick up your freaky cat.
Demon Cat::: Greetings, Frank the Human Boy.
Finn::: How did you almost know my name?!
Demon Cat::: I have approximate knowledge of many things. For instance, I know that I am possibly going to slay you and munch on your eyeballs. 
Finn::: Huh, yeah right. That sounds like idiot talk!
Demon Cat::: You're trespassing on my dungeon, manling. And I am the thing......you should be afraid of.
Finn::: You can't hurt me! I'm a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye!
Demon Cat::: I'm going to unzip your skin and wear you like a little coat.
Finn::: Unzip this! 
Finn::: Bleep!OOF!
Demon Cat::: Now, you DIE!! 
Demon Cat::: Wait a minute.Is that dog smell?! You... you have a dog with you? I'm outta here! 
Finn::: Yeah, right! Good excuse! Slaps, that cat was kicking my buns! And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank. Dang it, Jake! I'll get that crystal eye on my own! With my own odors.Hmm, no to skeletal remains door.No to giant monster mouth door.Oh! Giant key door it is!
Finn::: If Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it.Yeah! Key hand!Ouch!Hey! What the jug is that?
Finn::: Oh, sweet, the key!
Finn::: Ew, jelly cube?!Come on! Give it to me! Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna give it up!I'll never get that crystal eye! No. No, I just gotta stay pumped.Pump it up, pump it up! Whoo! Whoo! Shake it! Shake it! Ahh!Steady, Finn. This place is probably more creeped out of you than you are of it. 
Bucket Knight::: Halt! Come no further adventurer, for you see none can defeat... the Bucket Knight! 
Finn::: Okay, then I won't fight you.
Bucket Knight::: No! You must challenge me to-- 
Finn::: Hey cutie, do you know how to get to the crystal eye from here?
Bucket Knight::: Yes, it's through that door over there, but-- 
Finn::: Thanks!
Bucket Knight::: Hey! You can't pass through that door with out battling me!
Finn::: Yes, I can. Because I'm huge compared to you.
Bucket Knight:::Just add water and......exponential growth!
Finn::: Aw, buckets.
Bucket Knight::: Now, activate thine own powers, and we shall engage in thrilling single combat!
Finn:::Heh, thing is... I don't really... have any powers.
Bucket Knight:::I see...
Finn::: AAAAH!! Dang it, Jake wouldn't be running! He'd grow all big, and sock you right in the nose hole!Aw, nutzoids!Come on! All aboard the knuckle train to fist planet! 
Finn::: Oww... I rode the knuckle train? But... I... I'm in my element.
Finn::: AHHHHH!!!! Ow! OW! Ow! OW! Ow! Uhh! That... sucked.Alright, Finn, you're in a heavy pickle here. You don't have Jake, and you're on your own. But you can still handle this. You can still get that crystal eye! 
Demon Cat::: Hey, my dinner is back. And your dog isn't with you! That's what you said, right? Jack the Dog is not "accompanying" you?
Finn::: You mean Jake?
Demon Cat::: Jake, Jack, whatever. He's not here, which means I'm going to rip your heart out. 
Finn::: Crud, crud, crud, crud, crud!
Demon Cat::: You can't hide from me, Jim. I know almost everything, remember? I know exactly where you might be, Jim. I'm about to pounce on you.
Demon Cat::: One... two... three!Aw, man! I thought you'd be behind this rock. Hmm...Alright. I know where you are now! And I'm about to pounce again!One... two... three!Aw, man! Well, there's only a few more places to look.
Finn::: Oh, Jake... I'm such a fool. A silly, silly fool.Who the heck--?!
Guardian Angel::: Hey, it's okay. Shh, I'm your guardian angel, Finn. I'm here to save you.
Finn::: Re...really?
Guardian Angel::: Mmm-hm. Come here, let the angel pick you up.
Finn::: Okay.This is radical.
Guardian Angel::: Are you comfortable? Would you like some snacks?
Finn::: I'm fine, thank you.
Guardian Angel::: Here, let me clean you up, and mend your clothes. 
Finn::: Ha ha ha ha ha!
Guardian Angel::: I'm taking you to the chamber of the Crystal Eye....
Finn:::Aww, yeah!
Guardian Angel::: ... where I'm going to cook you and eat your flesh.
Finn::: Wow... Wait! What??!
Guardian Angel::: Trust in yourguardian angel!
Finn::: Put me down, lady!
Guardian Angel::: As you wish.
Finn::: Man, everybody wants to eat me up. It's probably 'cause I'm so sweet.
Guardian Angel::: Now for little kid soup.The secret is a low flame over a long period.
Finn::: That's Jake's secret, too. I sure hope he saves me.
Guardian Angel:::I will save thee, Finn.
Finn::: Lady, you are sick! Oh, Jake.
Jake::: What?
Finn::: Jake!
Jake::: Finn!
Finn::: What are you doing here?!
Jake::: I was looking for you, knucklehead! I was so worried, that right after lunch, I plunged into the dungeon after you.
Jake::: Strangest thing, though, I kept runnin' into obstacles.
Reaper::: Choose your dueling weapon!
Jake::: Uh... I choose... sandwich! 
Jake:::The challenges were impossible for me.
Jake:::But you would have blown right through. I kept thinking to myself, "What would Finn do?" Just...eh, frustrating. Know what I mean?
Finn::: Yeah... I think I do. 
Finn::: Now let's find a way out of this cage.
Jake::: I'll get us out with Key Hand! 
Finn::: I really don't see any key holes on this cage.
Jake::: Not a problem, man. Lock Hand!
Finn:::I'll get us out of here, with carrot hand!
Jake::: Alright, man. Let's go! We've still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet!
Finn::: Wait! You'd help me win a bet that I made that I said I could accomplish something without you?
Jake::: Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy!
Finn::: Cling!
Jake::: Alright, man. Let's give this crystal eye the old friendship lift.
Finn::: Okay.
Both::: Friendship, go!
Finn::: If I die, I'll have died with my best friend!
Jake::: Me, too!
Princess Bubblegum::: Get on my swan!
Princess Bubblegum::: I hope you learned a lesson from all this!
Both::: Uh, we learned that working together is better. Heh, whatever.
Jake:::Looks like that's not the answer she wanted.
Finn::: Uhh... I learned that you're a very... intelligent princess?
Princess Bubblegum::: You're darn right I am. Princess Bubblegum, away!!
