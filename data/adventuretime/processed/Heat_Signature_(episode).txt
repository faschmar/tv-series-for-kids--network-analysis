Finn::: Man, I still can't believe Marceline is 1,000 years old and has never seen Heat Signature. This movie is gonna blow their minds.
Finn::: Marceline! We brought Heat Signature.
Marceline::: Woot! Woot!
Jake::: Woo!
Marceline::: Hey, so I want you all to meet Finn and Jake. They aren't... completely lame.
Finn::: Whatup?
Marceline::: Guys, this is Wendy...
Wendy::: Hey.
Marceline::: Booboo...
Booboo::: Hello. Hello.
Marceline::: ...and Georgy.
Georgy::: Hey.
Marceline::: We used to be in a gang together back in the underworld.
Finn::: Hmm. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Hope y'all like getting your minds blown, cause it's showtime.
Finn:::What is wrong with this couch?
Jake::: Ehh, that made my teeth hurt.
Marceline::: Oh yeah. Sorry, I don't ever really sit on there. I just float usually. We... kinda all do.
Finn::: Aww, what? man, no fair.
Marceline::: Yeah, well, too bad you're not vampires. So, anyways, I...
Finn::: Wait! Hold on just a second.
Finn::: Marceline, we insist you turn us into vampires. Or ghosts, or whatever. We just wanna fly.
Marceline::: All right, all right. Fine.
Finn and Jake::: Yes!
Wendy::: Come on, Marceline! you're gonna turn these goofballs?
Marceline:::Don't worry, I've got something more fun in mind. 
Finn::: Okay, Marceline, we're ready now.
Marceline::: Okay, hold that thought. 
Georgy::: Huhuuuhhuh...
Marceline::: I'm gonna perform the biting ritual. You guys close your eyes and don't open them until I say so. If you do... your heads will EXPLODE! Okay, Finn. You first.
Marceline::: Bite.
Marceline::: Chomp.
Marceline::: Boop boop. Boop. Boop. Okey dokey. All done. How do you guys feel?
Finn::: Pretty... much... the same.
Jake::: My neck sort of hurts.
Booboo::: Don't you feel a little hungry...for blood?
Finn:::I felt it. Jake, do you feel it?
Jake::: Yeah, I could go for some blood.
Finn:::Oh no. Jake. Now we're gonna have to drink blood for all eternity.
Jake:::Yeah, what if we turn evil? I'll hafta start wearing cologne.
Marceline::: Relax, guys. You can satisfy your bloodlust without killing. Look.You just eat the color. Here, Jake. You try. 
Finn::: Ugh. Come on.
Jake::: Sorry, bro.Oh, snap! I feel... stronger. 
Finn::: Whooooa... Marceline, can we float now?
Marceline::: Mmm... Not yet. That's a really advanced power. First, you gotta go through vampire orientation.
Georgy::: Huhuuuhhuh...
Marceline::: Think you chumps can handle it?
Finn and Jake::: Oh, baby, yeah, baby, baby, baby, yeah, baby, yeah, yeah.
Marceline::: Okay, guys, the first phase of vampire orientation is learning......invisibility. 
Finn::: 
Marceline::: Ah! Hey! 
Marceline::: You ready for the power of...invisibility?
Finn::: With all my heart.
Marceline::: Good. Now, spin!
Marceline::: Give it a whirl, Jake!Now chant, "INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE!"
Finn and Jake::: INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE! 
Marceline::: Yup. It worked?
Finn and Jake::: 
Jake::: We're invisible! 
Finn::: You're invisible! 
Jake::: Hey. Then how come we can see each other?
Marceline::: Because you guys become vampires at the same time. So you are forever linked.
Finn and Jake::: AWW YEAH! 
Booboo:::Marceline...you're friends with some real morons. 
Lumpy Space Princess::: Oh, my glob, Melissa. Ever since Clara stopped eating meat, her skin looks so good. I mean, she still looks fat, but like, I can't say that junk to her face.
Jake::: Wow! LSP's a hobo!
Finn::: Let's mess with her.
Lumpy Space Princess::: I'm doing so awesome on my own. Like, right now, I found this can of beans.
Lumpy Space Princess::: Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff!
Finn:::She knows it's us.
Jake::: She must recognize our voices.
Finn::: Let's disguise them.We're invisible!
Lumpy Space Princess::: Melissa, I have to go. They got into my toilet paper. Melissa, I have to go! 
Lumpy Space Princess::: Give it back, you guys!
Jake::: Weeeee!
Finn::: Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, Jake!
Lumpy Space Princess:::Nooooooooo!
Lumpy Space Princess::: MY BEANS!!! 
Booboo::: Time to join in on the fun!
Lumpy Space Princess::: You guys ruined everything! I'm gonna kill you!
Finn::: But we're undead. 
Jake::: Geez, we really scared her.
Marceline::: Nice vampire scare, guys.
Finn::: Thanks.
Booboo::: Yeah, pretty good, fellas.You guys ready...for the next vampire lesson? 
Finn::: You know we are.
Booboo::: Good. 
Finn::: Ow! What's the point of this lesson?
Georgy::: Kick 'em harder! 
Finn::: Ow! It hurts!
Jake::: Ohhh!
Marceline::: Okay, everyone! Stop the toughness lesson!
Georgy::: What?
Marceline::: Finn, Jake. You guys okay?
Finn::: We're okay.It's all worth it.
Georgy::: See? They're fine.
Wendy::: When did you go all soft? You used to like teaching people about kicks. 
Georgy::: Hey, guys, I think you're ready to learn how to float. All you have to do is jump off that ledge. 
Finn::: Cool.
Marceline:::W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating. Like... uh... the spooky vampire walk. See? Spoooooky... wooo!
Finn::: Heh heh. No way.
Jake::: We wanna fly!
Marceline::: You guys stop right now.
Georgy::: Marceline, chill out. It's going to be okay. We've got a plan.Now, get in your flying positions. 
Finn and Jake::: VAMPIRES FOREVER!!! WOOO!
Marceline::: What are you guys waiting for? You said you had a plan.
Wendy::: We do. It's to let them die! 
Finn and Jake::: We did it! Yeah! Woohoo! Awesome!
Wendy::: Way to go, Marceline.
Marceline::: Hey, you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends!
Booboo::: They gotta die someday.
Wendy::: Hey! Let's invite them to our place! When they show up...
Wendy, Booboo and Georgy::: We'll suck their guts out through their brains!
Finn::: Did you see us?
Wendy::: Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing.
Booboo::: Hey, we're gonna throw a party... in honor of your new vampire skills.
Finn::: Holy snaps, that's awesome!
Marceline::: They're lying to you guys. They just wanna suck the guts out of the top of your head.
Finn, Jake, and ghosts::: What?
Booboo::: She's just jealous of you.
Wendy::: We'll see you at midnight at our place. 
Marceline::: Guys, promise me you're going to that party.
Finn::: We're not gonna go.
Marceline::: You're not?
Finn::: Nah. I'm kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill.
Marceline::: Oh. Okay.
Finn::: Well, we're going back home.
Jake::: Peace.
Finn::: Number 25, Blood Drive.Hey guys, we're here! Wow! Look at you guys! That's awesome!
Finn::: Uh...Georgy, what's wrong? Jake, what's happening?
Jake::: I think they're testing our vampire abilities.
Finn::: Oh, sweet. VAMPIRE KICK! 
Georgy::: Aw, come on. Will you knock it off already?
Wendy::: You know you're not even real vampires.
Finn::: Pssh. Then why am I flying, Wendy?Oh.Yo, man. I think Marceline tricked us.
Jake::: Yeah.
Marceline::: VAMPIRE KICK!!!Finn. Jake. I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should've never pranked you so perfectly.
Finn::: It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us.
Marceline::: Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing. I just came to apologize.
Finn::: Aw, man.I can't believe we're gonna die just because we wanted to be comfortable watching Heat Signature. 
Georgy::: Uh... did you guys say... Heat Signature?
Commander::: Have you located the enemy's heat signature, Private?
Private::: Yes, sir. But I also noticed something... strange. Something... I can't explain.
Commander::: Well, spit it out, man!
Private::: I... I... I can't seem to locate... our heat signature.
Finn:::This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop. Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever?
Georgy::: MMM-HMM. After the movie.
Finn::: Well, can't we just--
Marceline and ghosts::: Shhh!
Georgy::: Shut!
Private:::Look out, Commander!
Commander:::Aaaagh! My heat signature!
