Jake::: Alright. Whaddaya wanna see next?
Finn::: A cheetah! A fart!
BMO::: A cookie! An external hard drive! Ooh, ooh! Change into Finn, but give him my body!
Finn::: BMO, your ideas are boring.
BMO::: What? Your head on my body isn't boring! It's weird! 
Jake:::Alright, I'll try to turn into a cheetah farting.I can't do the spots.
Finn::: Sparkles on the house? LET'S SQUISH 'EM!
Jake::: Did you squish the sparkles?
Finn::: No. They're around this holo-message player. It's got a cartridge with it.
Jake::: Oh, snap!Well, plop that cartridge in the slot, playah!
Finn::: Yeah! Okay! 
Joshua :::Hello, boys. 
Finn and Jake ::: Dad!!
Joshua ::: If you're hearing this prerecorded hologram message, it's because I passed on, and my spirit sparkles guided you to its secret hiding place. Right now, I'm holding both of you in my hands. You're both still little squishy babies.I made you boys something. It's a dungeon. A proper dungeon. Full of evil monsters, traps, and magic. The whole kazoo!
Finn and Jake::: Whoa! Kickin'! Kickin'!
Joshua ::: Now, this next part of the message is just for you, Jake, so Finn, cover your ears.Jake... really, this dungeon is for Finn. I know I won't be around forever, and I wanna make something that will force Finn to toughen up.
Jake::: What?!
Joshua ::: Now, tell Finn to uncover his ears now.
Jake::: Dude, take your hands off your head.
Finn::: WHAT?!?!
Joshua ::: Alright, boys. Now to give you some incentive, at the end of the dungeon, I'm going to put the Family Sword. It's made out of Demon's Blood.
Finn::: Whoa, what the--?!
Jake::: Whoa, dang!
Blood Demon ::: Give me back my blood, Joshua!
Joshua ::: Kee Oth Rama Pancake.
Blood Demon ::: Waaaaah!! 
Jake::: Whoa!!
Finn::: Geez-louise!
Joshua ::: The dungeon's eighty paces west of here under a dumb-lookin' rock. And Finn, this dungeon's gonna kick your tail. I bet you won't even get past the first trial, ya whiny baby!
Finn::: What?? What was that about?
Jake::: Uh... 
Dumb Rock::: Duh... duh... du-ugh... duh...
Finn::: Whoo! 
Jake::: Whoa! Burgers and hotdogs! Yeah, yeah, YEAH! 
Finn::: Wait, Jake!
Jake:::But... burgers and hotdogs..
Finn::: Didn't you say you were hungry for burgers this morning?
Jake::: Yeah, so?
Finn::: And I said I was hungry for hotdogs?
Jake::: Mm-hmm, I remember.
Finn::: I don't think those burgers and hotdogs are burgers and hotdogs at all.
Jake::: Aaaahh...
Finn:::DUDE!!Look!
Joshua ::: Finn, cover up those nubs on your head.
Finn::: Man... again? 
Joshua ::: Alright. Hey, Jake, I wanna remind you what this dungeon's for.In order for Finn to stop whining, he needs to be put through a trial that forces him to take charge of a situation.
Jake::: But Dad, Finn's already figured that out. He's a good kid with a kind heart.
Joshua ::: Remember, Jake, this is a prerecorded holo-message. I can't hear you if you're talking to me right now.
Finn:::I'm gonna go walk around!
Jake::: Okay!
Joshua ::: Jake, I need your help. You gotta call Finn a whiny baby.
Jake::: But—
Joshua ::: Butts are for pooping! Do it for Poppy!
Jake:::Finn!
Finn::: Over here!Check it out, Jake. I found two ways. This way has some kinda flower trap, and that way... has that guy.
Ugly Monster::: None shall pass!
Jake::: Ugh... Let's take the flower path!
Finn:::Mmm.
Ugly Monster::: Wait! Why don't you wanna take my path?!
Jake::: Because... you're super gross, man.
Ugly Monster::: Oh... 
Finn::: Cheer up, man. We're only tellin' you you're gross because we're your bros.
Ugly Monster::: Really?
Finn::: Yeah! Bros are real with each other, and you're gross, brother. Take a bath.
Ugly Monster::: Thanks, brother. Hahaha.
Finn::: Hahaha, no probs.Hey, what did Dad say?
Jake::: Um... He said he's surprised a whiny baby like you made it this far.
Finn::: What?! Why's Dad sayin' all that jive??
Jake::: Mm...
Imaginary Joshua::: Jake, do it for Poppy! 
Jake:::Because... you cry like a baby... Baby!
Finn::: Dude... you're pickin' on me, too?
Jake:::Whoa.
Finn::: I don't even cry much. I only cry when it's healthy, like when people die.
Brown-haired witch::: Partake of the fruit... 
Finn::: Pff, blech... If I didn't cry when people died, I'd have a cold butt for a heart.
Blonde witch::: The fruuuuit...
Jake:::Waaaah, I cry when people die. Waaah, I'm Finn.
Black-haired witch::: Partake of the fruit!
Finn:::Maybe I will partake of the fruit.
Jake::: Dude, don't eat that!!
Finn::: Why not? All the people that I care about in this world are being wads.
Imaginary Joshua::: Don't you blow Poppy's cover!
Finn::: Whoa. 
Jake::: Time to go, baby.Finn, come on!
Finn::: I'm gonna hang here. With these fruit babes. They'll be my best buds now.
Jake::: Rrrr... Yah! 
Jake::: There's another cartridge.Alright, man, Dad told me not to tell you this, but—
Imaginary Joshua::: Don't tell 'im!
Jake::: You're not real.Dad asked me to call you "Baby" because he wants you to be tough.
Finn::: But I'm tough! My whole body is a callus!
Jake:::On this next holo-message we listen to, when Dad tells you to cover your ears, don't. 
Finn:::Hmmph.
Joshua ::: Hey, hey! Finn! Jake! You made it past the fruit witches! Hey, did they make you cry, Finn? Huh? Huh?I bet they did. Alright, now cover your ears, Sue!Jake, I'm almost done with this dungeon. I just have one last monster to fit into this pit I dug. I got him tied up in this building. It's really hard trying to fit him into this pit. He's pretty evil. Ha.You're gonna have a crazy time trying to defeat—WAAAAAH!!
Finn and Jake ::: DAD!
Finn:::Dad's sword!
Joshua ::: Hey, Jake, when Finn finishes this dungeon, play this tape for him...
Jake::: Finn!Dude! Use your karate biz!
Finn::: Ugh... I—I can't, man. I suck. I'm a whiny baby, and I'm fat, and all those things Dad said about me!
Jake::: Dude... Dad loves you!
Joshua ::: Finn! If you're seeing this prerecorded holo-message, it's because you finished the dungeon that I made for you. I'm proud of you. You're gonna do great things in this world. I love you, son.
Dumb Rock::: Duh... Duh...
Joshua ::: I made you boys something. It's babies. Full of babies. ...the family sword. It's made out of—babies.
Jake::: You know I don't think you're a baby, right?
Finn::: Yeah. I know.
Jake::: That sword is sweet!
Finn::: Yeah! I'm stoked to slay some evil with it.
Blood Demon::: Joshua! Return my blood to me, or by demon's law, I will cut off your love handles!!!Joshua, we go way back. Come on! Just give me back my blood!
