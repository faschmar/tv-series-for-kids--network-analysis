Voice:::Whoo, show me them legs!
Jake:::Shelby?
Shelby::: Hey, Dancing Bug! Uh, come on, man. Shake it.
Pincer Beetle::: No. I really couldn't—Okay! Maybe I could! 
Scorpion:::Whoa, dang, DB. You're the best bug at this party!
Shelby:::What? Hey, I got moves, too, guys.
Scorpion:::Yeah, right, Shelby. What are you gonna do? The Worm?
Shelby::: No. I'm gonna do parkour.
Scorpion:::Hmm.
Shelby:::Haha!Parkour!Ah, oh no. I really hurt myself.Guys, I'm so dumb! 
Shelby::: Ugh. Hey, somebody forgot their—oh, cram!Um...who are you?
Kent:::Pbht!
Shelby:::Oh. There's-There's a note. "Hey, dude, the tip of your tail got snipped off, so now you have a little brother. We named him Butty Butterson. Signed, the other bugs."I'll call you Kent for short.
Shelby:::Jake..Jake!
Jake::: Hmm? Whoa, Shelby! What's going on there? With your butt?
Shelby:::It's fine. I was goofing off, got hurt. Now I got a little brother. I named him Kent.
Kent:::I'm Kent!
Shelby:::Whoa! A talking brother.
Jake:::You can chop up a worm and get two? I thought that was a myth.
Shelby:::Myth is a powerful force in my life, dude. So the thing is, I don't know beans about being a big brother. Can you give me some tips?
Jake:::Ah, it's easy. You just give him something sharp and get him to fight bad guys.
Shelby:::That's it?
Jake:::Yeah, you might have to stretch all big if he gets in real trouble. But, yeah.
Shelby:::Alright. Sounds good.
Kent:::Someday, you'll be Kent's food. 
Kent::: Oh wow. 
Shelby:::Hey, how'd you do that?
Kent:::I don't know.
Shelby:::Hmm. Okay, Kent. This is real important. You're my little brother, so your purpose is to fight bad guys. So go fight some bad guys. Or girls. Don't discriminate.
Kent:::Oh. Okay, brother.Boo-oop. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!
Kent:::Hyah!A bad guy. Ah! Let's fight!Aaah! Hey, get back here! Don't run! I'm super new at fights. And at being alive. 
Dewdrop:::Hi.
Kent:::Who are you?Where am I? Why do my parts hurt?
Leaf Beard:::Oh, good, you're awake. I am Leaf Beard. I found you blonked out and bruised in the tunnels. But if you drink of our dewdrops, it will fix up all your ouchies.
Kent::: Pbht!
Leaf Beard:::The rat king has made his way to our end of the roots. You should be more careful.
Kent:::Oh. Oh, okay. What's a rat king?
Leaf Beard:::Oh. You're not from the roots.
Kent:::I'm from my brother's butt. Maybe.
Leaf Beard:::The rat king's been destroying our home, chewing up the roots of this tree. This tree that gives us life!
Guy:::Hey!
Kent:::So, he's a bad guy?
Leaf Beard:::So sick, nasty bad.
Kent:::That means I got to fight him. That's what my brother said to do! Where's my sword?
Leaf Beard:::Your sword was shattered to butts when I found you.
Kent:::Oh...bummer.
Leaf Beard:::Yes. Bums.
Kent:::What do I do?
Leaf Beard:::Um...I don't know. But the blacksmith could make you a new one, probably.
Dewdrop:::That's who I am. And I am very good at me. Okay, so, like, the rat king has been messing up the roots, yeah? Chewing on them with his teeth. The sword has to be made with the strongest tree stuff so even his teeth can't break it! Bring me the freshest ingredients and I'll do it up.
Kent::: Boo! Cool, cool.
Mouse Wizard:::Greetings.
Kent:::Hey, man. I'm looking for some unbreakable ore. Y'all got that here?
Mouse Wizard:::I have what you seek. But consider this instead.I offer you this treasure of glittering emeralds. You'll be infinitely rich and live the rest of your days in comfort.
Kent:::No, I'm good. Just the ore, please.
Mouse Wizard:::Oh, ho! Well done! By resisting the temptation of wealth, you have passed my test.
Kent:::Nah, I just don't care about money. My name's Kent. I'm supposed to fight bad guys.
Mouse Wizard:::Alright. That's pretty weird, but...here you go.The unbreakable ore. Uh... Uh..you can just—yeah.Oh, there, there she goes.
Kent:::Ha, ha!Boop, boop, ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop, boop, boop, boop.Whoop, whoop!
Mouse Knight:::Greetings. Come to fight me, eh?
Kent:::My name is Kent, and if I had a sword I'd totally fight you. But for now, I'm looking for a clod of mystic earth.
Mouse Knight:::Yes. I have what you seek. But consider this instead.I offer you the hand of one of my beautiful daughters. You'll become a good husband and live the rest of your days in true love.
Kent:::Nah, I don't care about being a good husband or wife or whatever. All's I care about is fighting bad guys.
Mouse Knight:::Dang, homes. That's cold.Here you go. Mystic earth.
Mouse Thief::: Greetings.
Kent:::Dude, you know why I'm here!
Mouse Thief:::Yeah. And I got what you want. But consider this instead. Hiya!Drink this sap, and you'll have life eternal. You'll never meet death and you'll outlast the world.
Kent:::Um...I was born earlier today, so I don't really get a sense of my own mortality. No, thank you.
Mouse Thief:::Hyah!The sacred flame.
Dewdrop:::Oh, what? 
Kent::: I name this sword..Punch Party!I feel so cool right now.It's party time.Whoa! Uh!
Rat King:::Greetings.
Kent::: Who's there?
Rat King:::I am the rat king.Why are you here?
Kent:::I-I've got, like, this rad sword, and...I'm gonna fight you with it.Yes!
Rat King::: Who are you fighting me for? Your brother?
Kent:::What?
Rat King:::Instead, why don't you join me? I offer you cosmic power. You'll be a king and live the rest of your days as a god.
Kent:::You're messing up the tree, and I totally live here! You're a bad guy!
Rat King::: Yeah. 
Kent::: Don't do that! 
Rat King:::How do you plan to defeat me?
Kent::: I'm...making...this...up...as I go! 
Shelby:::Having a brother around looks kind of fun.Where are you? Little Brother? Are you happy?Or do you feel weird? Have you changed a lot? Or not? Are you ever gonna come back here? I shouldn't have been so hasty. You were just a little baby. Or maybe you weren't. I'm not really sure how little brothers work. 
Kent:::You were the first friend I ever had.
Both:::No one can compare. Together we could probably fight a bear.So if you're ever sad/lonely, don't be, 'cause I'll beright here next to you. 'Cause that's what big brothers are supposed to do. 
Shelby:::Whoa!Kent proceeded his fantastic journey to me. It was all super good. But he had also partaken of the food of the underworld, and so he was compelled to return there by dewdrop law. That's what he said, at least. Maybe he was having second thoughts about infinite riches, true love, and eternal life. Or maybe he had just decided that fighting bad guys wasn't really his deal.But I do know this—free from the rat king's cursed teeth, that spring, for the first time in many years, the willow tree was in bloom.
