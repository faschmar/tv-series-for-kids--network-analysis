Finn::: Do you think it's right for Marceline to invite us to jam without Princess and BMO?
Jake::: It's just a jam sesh. Is that what you're gonna jam with?
Finn::: Yeah, man. Balloon music is the future. Listen. 
Jake::: Pretty good.  I don't think you mastered it yet.
Finn::: Well, duh. I just started.
Jake::: Oh, dude. There's a note.
Finn::: What's it say?
Jake:::  "Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back," blee-bloo-blop, "Don't go in my house."
Finn::: That's it?
Jake::: Yeah. Just "Don't go in my house" in all caps... written in blood.
Finn::: Hmm.  What are you doing?
Jake::: Eliminating desire from my heart. It helps pass the time.
Finn::: Come on! I can't do that! Let's play Cloud Hunt 'til she gets here.
Jake::: No, man, I got a mental block with Cloud Hunt!
Finn::: Yeah, that's what makes it awesome, 'cause I know I'll win.
Jake::: Oh, what?! Bring it on, brother! Now explain the rules 'cause I forget.
Finn::: Okay. I count to ten and you go hide somewhere. Then, I gotta try to find you. You can hide... anywhere in here. Anywhere in here, ...but Marcy's house is off limits because she said so. Okay?
Jake::: Got it.
Finn::: Okay. I'm gonna start counting. Ready?
Jake:::  Yes.
Finn::: Go! One...  Two... Three... Four... Five... Four...
Finn::: Cloud Hunt... GOTCHA! Huh. Hmm.  AH-HA!  JAKE!  Get out of there! Marceline's gonna kill you! Jake! I know this isn't a mirror. What the—?! You're doing it wrong, even! Get out! Get out!!  Dude, get out of there! She's gonna kill us! She'll be home any minute! Did you read the note?! I mean, you read the note! You told it to me!! 
Marceline:::  Smells like sourdough in here.
Jake::: She's gonna kill us. Once she finds out she's gonna tie us up and eat us like a spider.
Finn::: You don't think I know that?! Hmmmmmmm... We'll wait for the right moment and sneak out... right under her big, fat caboose.
Jake::: Okay, man. I can do this.  Egh! Egh! Egh!!
Finn::: Shh, here she comes!
Jake::: Here she comes...
Finn::: Shh, shh!!
Marceline::: Huh.
Jake::: Let's get outta here.
Marceline::: Hello?
Jake::: She didn't wash hands!
Marceline::: Is someone here?
Finn:::  Shh!!
Marceline:::That's what stinks.  Where are those dweebs? 
Finn ::: This is Jake!
Jake ::: And this is Finn!
Finn & Jake ::: We're not home right now, so...  ...leave a message!quiet down.] Leave a message! 
Marceline::: Uh... Yeah, hey, you guys. Are you still coming over? It's jam time, so, like, call me, 'kay?
Jake::: Whatcha doin'?
Finn:::Get down.Love, FINN + JAKE"] When she gets this, she'll leave and we can escape!
Jake::: Brilliant... but how's it gonna work?
Finn::: I'll fly the paper as an airplane down the bedroom ladder. It'll triple barrel roll past the kitchen, open the fridge, and cook some eggs, then eat the eggs, and unfold itself as it lays in the carpet in front of Marceline's door!
Jake::: Yeah, yeah, awesome, yeah!!
Jake::: No, nah, nuts!
Marceline::: Welp... they're not gonna show up, then I'll just work on my own stuff, I guess.  Take one for new concept album based on five hundred years of my journal entries. So here's some preliminary notes.  I... I wanna make this the most emotional album ever. So private and secret, that I'll never let anyone hear.
Jake:::  This is so wrong.
Marceline::: No one can ever hear it. Ever. Take one.
Jake:::  We've crossed the line! I'm gettin' outta here, man!
Finn::: Yeah! Do it!
Finn::: What? What's it doing?!
Finn & Jake::: Shh, shh, shh!!
Marceline::: Oh, what?! What happened?! Ugh!  Where are you?! Oh, there you are... My broom.
Marceline:::   Stupid... thing— Get...  NO! Stupid—  UGH!!   Ugh!
Finn::: Is it safe?
Jake::: I dunno, man. Go scope the scene.
Jake::: What happened, man?
Finn:::I'm not goin' back out there.
Jake::: Well... whaddaya mean? What happened?Bro?
Finn::: Is she awake?
Jake::: Why are you talking?!
Finn::: I'm wondering if she's awake.
Jake::: Well, if she's awake, she can definitely hear you talking!
Finn::: I'm whispering.
Jake::: Well, now we're both quietly screaming.
Marceline:::  I can hear both of you.
Finn ::: Disguise yourself, fool!
Marceline::: What're you bozos doing in my lair?
Jake::: Dude, I think she sees us!
Finn::: What the—?! DUDE! You shape-changed to look like me?! 
Jake::: Well, yeah!
Marceline::: HEY!  Exssssplain yourselves.
Finn:::  We were playing hide-and-seek in your closet and you came home, so we hid in there all day. We saw... everything. And, oh, Glob, I mean, whatever you do to us, I just wanna say, we're sorry.
Jake::: So sorry.
Marceline:::  Okay... apology accepted.
