Finn:::Jake! W-whoa!<nowiki></nowiki>
Finn:::Whatever. 
Finn:::Oh, what happened? Where's the deer? Paging Dr. Ice cream! Dr. Ice cream cream for my mouth!Ahh, dude, I broke my stems! Hello? Jake? Princess? What the blizz. Come on, people.
Jake:::Huh? Oh, Finn, you're awake!
Finn:::Yeah, I'm awake, but my jams are all busted.
Jake:::Right. Yeah, I saw that.
Finn:::So, what happened? Did you save everybody?
Jake:::Oh, yeah, I think so. Maybe.
Finn:::So, Jake, there's nobody here. Did you notice that?
Jake:::Yeah, pretty freaky.Don't worry—ouch—they're all hiding.
Finn:::From what?
Jake:::From me!
Finn:::What?!
Jake:::It's my birthday, man! Lady Rainicorn put together a elaborate surprise party.
Finn:::She told you?
Jake:::No, but I know Lady Rainicorn. Ouch!This is totally something she would do. Think about it.
Finn:::Oh, yeah, okay. So, wait, the whole kingdom is in on it?
Jake:::Yes, and they'll only come out if they think we'll be surprised. So we got to act like we're totally unaware, okay?
Finn:::Okay, man, and how do we do that?
Jake:::Just do what I'm doing.Oh, look at me, living free without a suspicion in the world. Never in my wildest dreams would I guess someone was plannin' a surprise birthday party for me!Pretty tricky, right?Come on, let's go back to the hut.
Finn:::The what?
Jake:::Come on, come on! 
Finn:::Whoa. When did you find time to build this?
Jake:::I don't know. It didn't take long. 
Finn:::Hm. So, what should I do now?
Jake:::Collect branches for the hobo fire, dude.
Finn:::Okay. 
Jake::: Ouchies.
Finn:::A hobo fi-ya, fi-ya, fi-ya.Boy, it sure is quiet around here! Uh-huh! I'd probably pee all over myself if somebody jumped out and surprised me!Oh, ugh! I stink! How long was I out for?

I nobody's gonna jump out of the bushes and peeps my bod!Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! Hmmm.
Jake:::Just gotta char off the rotten parts—good as new, man! Stay vigilant. Eat your protein.
Finn:::Jake?
Jake:::Hmm?
Finn:::I'm starting to question your theory about the surprise party.
Jake::: Shhh!Don't talk so loud! They might hear you!
Finn::: But what if they're in trouble?What if something happened to them? We should try looking around.
Jake:::Noooo!You'll ruin my surprise party! Oww!
Finn:::Dude, are you okay?
Jake:::Just promise me, Finn. Promise not to look around.
Finn::: Okay, I promise.
Jake::: ...my birthday's gonna be rad.

Jake::: What?
Finn:::I heard a sound coming from the sewer! We should check it out.
Jake:::No, man, they'll surprise party me when they're ready. Be patient.
Finn::: I'm being patient! I waited all day, Jake!
Jake:::Well, I've been waiting six months!
Finn:::Wait, what are you saying?
Jake:::Everything's gonna be fine, even if we have to wait forever.

Finn:::Can I join your puppet party? We'll have twice the puppet voices!
Jake:::You won't run away?

Finn:::How's your noggin?
Jake:::Not crazy anymore! How's your legs?
Finn:::Hmm, still broken. 
Princess Bubblegum:::Thank you for saving my kingdom, boys. The deer wanted our sugar, but I didn't give him any, if you know what I mean. 
Finn::: Um... pyew! It's stanky in here!
Jake:::Yeah, like bad breath and eggs.
Finn:::Let's go home so we can get baths.
Candy Person:::I wanna get clean!
