Tree Trunks::: Shelby. Shelby, wake up.
Shelby:::Where am I? Tree Trunks, what's going on?!
Tree Trunks::: Uh, you've been snoozing on my dome. I just woke up in this room with these fellas::: Nectar, Ice Cream, and one of the Lemoncarbs.
Lemongrab:::Awake.Avast, hold tight your buns, if buns you do hold dear; for time has come to wake and run and not give way to fear!
Tree Trunks::: What are those awful words?
Lemongrab:::I'm reading the wall.They are wall words.
Tree Trunks::: Beyond this room are a thousand rooms, outside of them still more.
Shelby::: Behind each door, on every floor, danger, danger, ever more.
Neptr::: Stranger, hark! The traps galore may kill you whilst you do explore. To free yourself - 
Ice King:::Huh? Oh. Now where were we? To free yourself from this tomb, and nevermore re-enter, find the room amidst the rooms that lies exactly center?
Shelby::: It's a map!
Lemongrab::: I no longer need this map. I have infallible recall.
Tree Trunks::: Oh! The room is trying to hug us!Oh no!
Ice King::: Oh, dag.
Neptr::: Check out my mods, bro. 
Lemongrab::: Enough of this! 
Ice King::: Huh? This room doesn't have any doors. 
Tree Trunks::: W- We're trapped!
Lemongrab:::This is wrong. The map lied to me-e. It doesn't want me to find the EXIT! Ice King, h-how do you taste?
Ice King::: Uh, nice, I guess? 
Lemongrab::: Mild or SPICY?!
Ice King::: Oh, uh -Kinda lonely.
Lemongrab::: Make yourself into food! Now!
Ice King::: You're going to eat me? Yeah, right.
Neptr::: Slop your mouths up. I have found an oven and baking supplies. 
Tree Trunks::: I can make an apple pie for all of us.
Lemongrab::: Make them fast, servile.
Tree Trunks::: If you want a taste of my juicy apple pie you better be nice. You got that?
Lemongrab::: I am sorry. Make pies, slave.
Tree Trunks::: Okay, that's better, now let's see about this pie business.
Tree Trunks::: All right, gentlemen. Have a look at my luscious, gooey apple pie.
Lemongrab::: No!Acceptable.
Shelby::: Uh, Lemongrab?
Lemongrab::: WHAT?!
Shelby::: Never mind.
Ice King::: Come on, you guys. That mouse showed us the room door.
Ice King:::Say, you know what's weird?
Neptr::: What, Papi?
Ice King::: Well, isn't it weird how Tree Trunks' ability to make pies is specifically what helped us escape from that room?
Neptr::: I make pies, too, Papi.
Ice King::: Right, yeah, like, battery pies or summin'? 
Neptr::: No. Real pies. Don't you remember? I am your s- 
Ice King::: Hey! Look, another room!
Ice King::: Good grief, it's humid in here.
Lemongrab::: That door will lead us closer to the exit!
Ice King::: Hold up, hold up!Look! 
Ice King::: There has to be a way to get across without that thing chompin' our WOO-HOOS!
Neptr::: Can't you fly us across, Papi?
Ice King::: Oh yeah, I can sure try.
Ice King::: Nggh! Aw dang, this heat is negating my powers! Can't do nothin' with this steam coming off the water. 
Ice King::: NGH, glob! Fah!Nagh! Look at this!Well, that's it. Show's over. I'll just die here and y'all can eat my body if you want to survive.
Tree Trunks::: Golly, how we ever gonna worm our way out of this... fishy situation?
Shelby::: I think I have an idea.
Shelby::: That's a girl, Tree Trunks! You can do it!
Shelby:::This is gonna work out just fine.
Tree Trunks::: Oh, that's warm on my undercarriage.
Ice King::: H-help me guys!
Neptr::: Yes, Papi! 
Ice King::: NNGH! Lemongrab, c'mon!
Tree Trunks::: Bleh! Wow, that was heavy, man.
Tree Trunks::: Aw yeah, I've been reborn!
Neptr::: Look! 
Tree Trunks::: Let's go then!
Neptr::: Papi, no!Ouchies!
Tree Trunks::: Look out,  Shelby!
Lemongrab::: WOOAH! WUOAGH!
Lemongrab::: OUGHF! MY JUICE!! MY VITAL JUICES!!!
Lemongrab::: MOMMY!!!
Lemongrab::: The hidden door! Hohuugh.. 
Lemongrab::: My vital essence depleted... Must.. replenish...
Tree Trunks::: Oh, step back, you all. 
Shelby::: Ugh!
Ice King::: Ew.
Lemongrab::: Nugh.. That'll do, Slave Trunks. To the spiraling ledge! 
Ice King::: We almost there, Lemongrab?
Lemongrab::: Yes.
Shelby::: Faster, TT!
Tree Trunks::: Don't criticize my running, Shelby.
Lemongrab::: This door leads to the center exit!
Neptr::: The door is secured with an esoteric encryption system.
Ice King::: Well that's okay, 'cause you can hack the mainframe or whatever, right BMO?
Neptr::: I'm not BMO, I'm your son Neptr. I-I throw pies.
Ice King:::Ohhhs! I grabbed the wrong robot!Dang! Nuts face!
Shelby::: Uhhh ... what is going on here Ice King?
Tree Trunks::: Yes, I'm getting a weird feeling in my stomach, and I think it's 'cause of you, Mr. Wizard you'd better fess up to whatever you're doing.I got no time for nobody dancing around and acting fool at my expense.I'm Tree Trunks and people know I'm kind and honest, that's why people like me. 
Ice King::: Huh? Wha-wha-what's she sayin'?
Tree Trunks::: So stop sellin' fib-bibs and give it straight! 
Ice King:::Grrrr! All right! I knocked you all out and brought you here!
Ice King:::I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Each of you possess the exact qualities to pass the various tests of this dungeon::: Tree Trunks with your baking skills;Lemongrab with your lemony-juicy... 
Lemongrab::: Essence.
Ice King::: Yeah...Shelby, who should've been the bait for the fish.
Shelby::: Yeah..but no, thanks. 
Ice King::: And..BMO, who should've been here instead of this weird piece of junk that I don't remember nothin' about.Ahhh, I failed!
Neptr::: Father! Look at me. 
Neptr::: Are you happy with me now, Papi?
Ice King:::Yes! Yes! Oh, my son!The grand prize of my loins!
Ice King::: Now you see why I needed to bring you all here. Behold! The Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving!
Tree Trunks::: What's it do?
Ice King::: Whatever goes in the Magi's flames..comes to life, anything at all!
Tree Trunks::: Uh, like an ashtray?
Ice King:::Yes! Isn't it amazing?!
Shelby:::Uh..You should've told us! I would've freaking brought something!
Ice King::: Do not be sad. Because I brought the ultimate thing!This.
Neptr::: Your journal?
Ice King::: Except..it's not my journal!It's my Fionna & Cake fan-fiction!All my brilliant fantasies will now be real.Fionna, Cake, Marshall Lee; they'll all be living, breathing beings, just like me.
Lemongrab:::  You serve no function, you must be destroyed!
Ice King::: Yes! Yes! 
Book::: Woo, hahaha, yeah! 
Ice King:::No..NO! Another cruel joke on my life! 
Ice King::: Oh, good..you're awake, you bum. Look what you did.. Get out of my Face! Yeah, yeah Get out! 
Finn:::This is the spot? Right here?What was that?!
Tree Trunks::: C'mon Ice Cream. We-we're leavin' 
Ice King:::OK.
Jake:::I'm tellin' you dude, my pie-dar's goin' 'nay-nays. 
Jake::: Oww!
Book::: Write in me!
Finn::: What the—This is very strange.
Jake::: TT! Where is the pie at?! 
Tree Trunks::: Oh, Mister Lemoncarb ate it.
Lemongrab:::Bye, don't follow me. 
Shelby::: Hey, Jake can I catch you a ride back home?
Jake::: Yeah, but what the heck is goin' on here? 
Shelby::: Ice King was doin' some... desperate business, but it didn't work out.He seems pretty bummed out 'bout it.
Neptr::: Don't be sad, Papi. Your characters can always be real in the garden of your mind.
Ice King:::They can? 
Neptr::: Remember when you showed me your imagination zone?
Ice King::: Yes! Yes, if I can concentrate... 
Ice King:::It worked!
Fionna:::I missed you, Ice King!
Ice King::: Oh, Fionna, can dreams be real as waking life?
Fionna::: Of course they can! Dreams are real!
Ice King::: Then I will wait for you, from across the threshold of consciousness.
Neptr::: Our worlds will surely meet, Ice King.
Ice King:::I, too, feel this; and it feels so strong it must be true.
Finn:::Who in this world is sadder than the Ice King?
Shelby:::Me, watching this.
Book:::Yeah! Write it down! Write it down!
