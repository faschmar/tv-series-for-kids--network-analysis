Starchy:::Honey I'm home! Oops. I forgot I lived alone. Well, no bother. I won the Golden Shovel Award.Candy Kingdom's premier award for grave-digging excellence. There. Now to hang up my tuxedo so it doesn't wrinkle. 
Banana Guard #1:::You're missing hangers, too?
Banana Guard #2:::Well, I don't really use hangers.
Banana Guard #1:::Have you considered folding? We better call Princess Bubblegum.
Princess Bubblegum:::And then I called you guys.
Finn:::To find all the wire hangers?
Jake:::Wouldn't you rather have us fighting evil demons or something?
Princess Bubblegum:::Maybe an evil demon is stealing all the hangers.
Jake:::Hmm.
Jake::: See anything?
Finn::: No, it's pretty quite out there.
Jake:::Yeah, but not so much in here.
Finn:::Huh? What does that mean?
Finn:::Oh, Jake, no!
Finn:::Wait, hold on.
Jake:::It's over, Ice King!
Ice King:::Oh, hi, guys.
Finn:::What's going on? Is kidnapping hangers your new thing now?
Jake:::Yeah, man, you have, like, one muumuu, and you're wearing it.
Ice King:::You think this is about hangers? Really?
Finn:::Well... Yeah, because you're stealing all the hangers.
Jake:::You're stealing everyone's hangers, dude.
Ice King:::It's about so much more! Come back to my place, and I'll explain everything.
Finn and Jake:::Hmm.
Ice King:::See? I dropped my keys down this deep hole. I need all these hanger guys to help me snag 'em. When I'm done, I'll return them all, and that's an ice promise.
Finn:::How long has this crack been here?
Ice King:::Forever. Before forever. What the...Oh! Something's got me!
Finn:::Let go of the hanger!
Ice King:::Huh?
Jake:::Let go!
Ice King:::Oh.
Jake:::This calls for an investigation.
Ice King:::All right. Stand back!Follow me, fellas!
Ice King:::Watch your heads.
Ice King:::Holy moly! Do you know what this extra square footage means when I decide to sell?
Finn:::There's something in here.
Jake:::What is it?
Finn:::I don't know.
Ice King:::Well, no rest for the sexy.
Jake:::That's not the expression.
Ice King:::Boy, this is strong. A lot stronger than my ice. 
Patience St. Pim::: Dudes!
Finn:::Hello.
Patience St. Pim:::What year is this?
Finn:::Uh, nobody really keeps time like that.
Patience St. Pim:::It worked! I mean, I feel like it worked. This is the future, right?
Finn:::Who are you? You're like a beautiful Ice King.
Jake:::Oh, boy, here we go.
Ice King:::Back off, son! I saw her first!
Patience St. Pim:::Chill, you guys."Chill"? Get it? I'm Patience St. Pim, the ICE ELEMENTAL! Whoo!Did you see that? I made ice... with my hands.
Finn:::I'm Finn the human, and this is Jake the dog.
Jake:::Hello.
Patience St. Pim:::Who's a good boy?
Ice King:::Ahem. They call me the Ice King. I also make ice. 
Finn:::He's been using his powers a lot today.
Patience St. Pim::: Hup! Well, I think you're pretty groovy. Do you wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna be my acolyte?
Ice King:::Sure. What's that? Like a boyfriend?
Patience St. Pim:::More like an intern.
Ice King:::Oh.
Patience St. Pim:::Uh, no, you're right. It is more like a boyfriend.
Ice King:::Cool.
Patience St. Pim:::YOU'RE COOL! Dialed in, you know?
Ice King::: Huh, what?
Patience St. Pim:::Yeah. Uh, hey, this might be a weird question, but do you know where the slime, candy, and fire dudes are?
Finn:::She's talking about the princesses.
Jake:::I'm starting to get a weird feeling.
Ice King:::Oh, you must mean Slime Princess, Princess Bubblegum, and Flame Princess.
Patience St. Pim:::Princesses?
Ice King:::We're like this!
Patience St. Pim:::That is so fun. Okay now, this next request may sound super sketch.
Ice King:::Okay.
Patience St. Pim:::I need you to round them up and bring them back here. Like, even if they don't want to come. You think you could do that?
Ice King:::Are you kidding? That's in my wheelhouse, right up my alley! Classic Ice King.
Patience St. Pim:::So, wait, is it in your wheelhouse or up your alley?
Ice King:::Classic Ice King.
Finn:::Hold on a minute. You can't make Simon start kidnapping princesses again.
Jake:::Yeah, he's semi-reformed.
Patience St. Pim:::Excuse me for a second, boyfriend.
Finn:::Okay Jake---
Ice King:::Wow, you got their initials on there, and look at those shapes. We're kind of like a power couple.
Patience St. Pim:::Get me those princesses.
Ice King:::You got it, boss.
Patience:::I'm done hiding out.
