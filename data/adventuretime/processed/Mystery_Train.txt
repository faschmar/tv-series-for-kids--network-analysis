Colonel Candy Corn:::That's quite alright. Just don't let it happen again. 
Conductor over intercom::: Sorry about that, folks. We're approaching Gumball Gulch now. The rides gonna get a little bumpy until we reach the straight-away and you might wanna buckle up! 
Jake:::Found a schedule!
Finn::: Great! Now find your seatbelt.
Mr. Candy Cane::: Jeez Louise! So sorry about that Colonel!Beg your pardon!Sorry! Whoa!! 
Mr. Candy Cane::: Colonel, I am so sorry.
Finn::: Hey! We're in the straight-away!
Mr. Candy Cane::: Oh, I want to see! 
Colonel Candy Corn::: I'm gonna kill you!
Finn::: A skeleton...Is he going to be okay, Doctor Donut?
Doctor Donut::: He doesn't look good.
Jake::: Hey man, this is kinda a bad scene. Maybe we should get off the train and huff it to your surprise.
Finn::: Are you kidding? It's a murder mystery! On a train!And we're gonna solve it.
Jake:::Alright.
Finn::: What'dya think, Doctor Donut? Any clues?
Doctor Donut:::Hmm. I think it was the guy would screamed 'I'm gonna kill you.'
Colonel Candy Corn::: No, no! It wasn't me, I swear!
Finn::: Passengers, passengers! I don't think it was Colonel Candy Corn.
Colonel Candy Corn::: Thank you!
Finn::: No, in murder mysteries it's never the first person you think of. Never ever.
Marshmallow Kid::: So who do you think it is?
Finn:::Colonel, do you have any enemies on this train?
Colonel Candy Corn::: Just one! And his or her name is...
Finn::: See? I knew it wasn't him!But now we need to figure out who his enemy is. It could be anybody.
Green Gumdrop Dude::: It could even be you.
Finn::: Yes it could.Except I didn't do it.
Green Gumdrop Dude::: But... we don't know that.
Finn:::You singled me out to take suspicion of yourself! Are you Colonel Candy Corn's enemy?
Green Gumdrop Dude::: What? No! I was just trying to join in on the conversation!
Finn:::Suspect numero uno!
Finn::: Rat traps! Really thought I was onto something!
Jake::: Now I know this is going to sound crazy, but what about the conductor?
Finn::: No it's definitely not him.
Jake:::Oh. Why not?
Finn::: 'Cause he's weird and creepy. And you never suspect the creepy guy because he's too obvious.
Jake::: Whatever, man. I'm gonna go sit and look at the schedule. 
Finn::: We're running out of suspects. And we're running out of time.
Conductor::: Attention!Attention passengers!Nollie, heheheh. Yeah hi, it's me, the conductor. Heheh. Anyway, I couldn't help overhearing that someone thinks I'm weird and creepy. And you know; I'm not weird and creepy.I'm cool and awesome.Happy birthday, Finn. 
Finn::: Hey Jake.
Jake::: Yeeeeeeeaaah?
Finn::: The conductor was just here and he was weirder and creepier then before.
Jake::: What?! No way, he was cool and awesome!
Finn::: Anyway, it's still not him. ] No. The murderer is right here among us. ] Isn't that right, Doctor?
Doctor Donut:::You think it was me?
Finn::: When Candy Cane guy was murdered, you diverted suspicion to Colonel Candy Corn.Then killed him to protect your alibi.
Doctor Donut::: Are you kidding?
Jake::: Dude, I think you're waaay off.
Finn::: Am I? Or am I way on.
Finn::: Son of a-
Finn::: My hunches aren't getting me anywhere! The killer is laughing at us, Jake.
Jake::: What'dya think we should do?
Finn::: Hmmm... We need hardevidence!
Finn::: Ha!A basket of eggs, fish and cabbage!
Finn::: It's a receipt! From an earlier train ride. From another train!
Finn::: Jake! I found a book! It's a dictionary!
Finn::: It's sheet music! 
Finn::: It doesn't make any sense to me. 
Jake::: Me neither!Maybe the murderer is just too smart for us.
Finn::: Yes! Jake, that's it! It's all so clear now! Gather everyone in the caboose and I will reveal a murderer!
Finn::: You're the only remaining passengers. So the murderer, is in this caboose. 
Finn::: Let me explain how I know who the murderer is.I saw Pineapple Guy skim through the sheet music. Sheet music to a song that's very special to Lollipop Girl. A song that reminds her of Ice Cream Guy.Before Colonel Candy Corn's aide, Doctor Ice Cream was in possession of a basket of cabbage, fish and eggs.And you, Pineapple Guy, have cabbage bits on your socks!And you!Chocolate Bar Guy!Does this dictionary look familiar? A dictionary that contains the wordsRid!Guests!At once!
Finn::: But the real murderer is someone no one suspects! The real murderer is-
Finn::: No one was the murderer?!
Jake::: The conductor's still on the train!
Finn::: Oh yeah! He did it.
Jake::: Yay, you did it, you solved it, Finn!
Finn::: I knew it; because he's creepy.
Jake::: What?! Humpf.
Finn::: I know. You knew he was the murderer all along. I couldn't have done it withoutyou, you, you 
Jake::: Thank you.
Finn::: We make a great team, pal.
Finn::: You feel kinda bony.Jake?NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Conductor::: Hey.
Finn::: How could you murder all those Candy People?! And, you murdered Jake on my birthday! 
Conductor::: Yes, and you're next.
Finn:::Wrong!
Finn:::I'm coming for you!This is for Jake!You're going down, or both of us are going down!My birthday wish, is vengeance!Happy birthday to me!!
Conductor::: Wait! [Stretches himself around to reveal that it is actually Jake covered in paint.
Finn:::You're alive!!You were the conductor the whole time?!
Jake:::Yup. You were so focused on the murders because you never even noticed!The skeletons were the hardest part.It was all an elaborate set up for your birthday present!
Finn::: So nobody was murdered?
Jake::: Nope! Not unless you count the train's control panel!
Jake::: Dude, open your eyes!
Finn::: Hey, we're alive!
Candy People::: -to you!
Finn::: Wow, this is the best birthday ever. Thanks, Jake.
Jake::: You deserve it, buddy.Because you're a great friend.
