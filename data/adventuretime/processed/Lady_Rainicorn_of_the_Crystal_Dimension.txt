Lee:::You know this is for the best. (이렇게 하는게 최선이라는 거 알지.)
Lady Rainicorn::: Also, you can't take my son, TV! (그리고 내 아들 TV도 못 데려가!)
Lady Rainicorn::: TV!Don't make me laugh. (웃기고 있네.)
Lady Rainicorn::: TV!
TV::: You've got such a cool place, Lee.
Lee::: Well, you're a cool guy, too. Aren't you? (고마워. 근데 너도 멋진 놈인 거 같은데. 아니야?)
TV::: Cool? Yes, I am. How much did this place cost?
Lee::: Oh, its not my house. I'm squatting. (아 이거 내꺼 아니야. 그냥 빈집에 들어와 있는거야.)
Lee:::Yeah, I've got him. Get the boys over here. (응, 응, 그래. 여기다 가둬 놨어. 애들 데리고 와.)

Lee::: This is what I think about dogs, baby (이게 내가 개들을 어떻게 생각하는지 보여주는거야, 어때, 죽이지?)
Lee:::Yeah! Hey dogs! You're stupid!Bow wow wow wow! (야! 멍멍이들! 야 이 개들아! 머리에는 뭐가 들었냐? 멍멍멍! 멍!)
Lee:::Hey! Dog cop! Watsa matter?! Not used to rainicorns standing up to you? (야, 개 경찰! 쫄았냐? 레이니콘이 이렇게 대드는 건 처음 봐?)
Lee:::Get a load of this, baby! (자기야, 멋진거 보여줄까?)
Lee:::Boom!
Lady Rainicorn:::Oh, Lee.
Lee:::Baby, did you see that? (자기야, 봤지?)
Lee:::I hate dogs so much! (개들이 너무 싫어.)
Lee::: We don't need to follow dog's rules! (봤지, 우리가 개들 법을 따라야 할 이유는 아무것도 없다고.)
Lady Rainicorn::: Yeah. (맞아.)
Ethel (Lady Rainicorn's mother):::  Ding-dong! Doting parents delivery service.
Bob (Lady Rainicorn's father)::: Your mother and I were in the neighborhood.
Ethel::: One can't live on love alone; One must also have groceries.
Lee::: Hey, groceries are a dog-driven concept.There's enough nutrition in that macrame owl on the wall there to feed this entire city for a year! (아, 장모님, 장보는 건 개들 작전에 말려드는 거에요. 저기 벽에 걸려 있는 부엉이만 해도, 어, 일 년동안 온 동네 사람들을 먹여살리는데.)
Ethel:::Whatever does she see in such an idiot?
Lee::: Ah, you're beautiful, baby! (아, 자기야 너 진짜 아름답다.)
Lady Rainicorn::: Oh, lee!
Lee::: Watch this, baby! (자기야, 이거 봐봐.)
Lee:::Whoooo! I hate dogs! I hate those stinkin' dogs! (워후! 아, 나 개들이 싫다! 저 멍청한 개들이 진짜 싫어!)
Lady Rainicorn:::Lee....
Lady Rainicorn::: Lee?
Lee::: All we gotta do is follow this map! (이제 이 지도대로만 가면 되는거야!)
Roy :::You mean this stolen map?!
Lady:::What's this? (이게 뭐야?)
Roy:::Lady!
Lee:::Uh, nothing.. nothing, nothing. (아, 아니야, 아무것도.)
Lady Rainicorn:::No way! You're going too far, Lee! Breaking into a dog military installation! You could trigger another rainicorn-dog war! (이건 너무 심해. 이건 개들의 군대 체제를 침법하는 거잖아! 니가 레이니콘과 개들의 전쟁을 다시 일으킬 수 있어!)
Lee:::You know, I'm actually glad you caught me. We can't do this without you. The rainicorns need you. Lee needs you.
Lady Rainicorn:::Aww....
Lee::: Finally, the Mergence of Destruction! I'm gonna rain pain on all those dumb dogs! (드디어 파괴의 원동력이 내 손안에 들어왔어! 내가 멍청한 개들한테 따가운 비를 뿌려, 윽...)
Lady Rainicorn:::I'm sorry, my love. (자기야 미안해.)
Roy::: Hey, whats going on? Wha?
Roy:::Ahh!
Lee:::You can't stop me. I'm gonna get that nugget someday! I'll chase you to the ends of the crystal dimension!
Lady Rainicorn::: Mom, dad, I've got to get out of town fast!(엄마, 아빠, 저 지금 여기로 떠나야 돼요.)
Ethel::: You're leaving? Do you want any groceries to take with you?
Lady Rainicorn::: Mom, no. Listen, I don't know if I can ever come back. The Crystal Mergence must be kept far from here. (어, 괜찮아요. 저, 저 언제 돌아올 지 모르겠어요. 이 수정 활성화를 여기서부터 없애야 돼요.)
Ethel::: Okay, but take a purse. I have tons of them.
Lady Rainicorn:::Thanks, mom! Thanks, dad! I love you! (고마워요, 엄마 아빠! 사랑해요!)
Bob::: No more nose ring bozo.
Ethel::: Prayer works.
Cinnamon Bun :::Oh! Ohhhh, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! What am I gonna do?
Lady Rainicorn::: Weird.The trees are lovely here. (어우, 쟨 뭐야? 여기 나무들은 풍성하구나.)
Lady Rainicorn::: I'll keep you hidden for as long as I must. (너 잘 숨겨놓을 거야 내가. 내가 잘 지킬거야...)
Lady Rainicorn::: Roy!
Roy::: Lady!
Lady Rainicorn::: Is Lee here? 
Roy::: No. Lee hasn't been here for.... Hey, hey, hey, don't go back there. 
Lady Rainicorn::: Ah-hah!Oh.
Roy::: Its just coffee. I work here now.
Lady Rainicorn:::  Where is he hanging out? This is important. I have to know where he is right away! (얘 어디서 있는거야? 이거 진짜 중요한 일이야. 나 빨리 얘 찾아야 해!)
Roy:::Hey, I, now, I- I don't keep in touch, alright? I just want to make a good coffee.
Lady Rainicorn::: Quality.... Like this?! (품질... 이렇게?!)
Roy:::  No! My latte!!
Lady Rainicorn:::Talk! (빨리 불어!)
Roy::: I don't know! I'm not into, y'know- I have my own business. Quality coffee.
Lady Rainicorn::: You mean this coffee? (이거 말이지?)
Roy:::Thats my kona! I-I'll tell you all the stuff I know. There was no sign of you, so Lee wentway underground. Started running with a crew of revolutionary dogs. Dogs! I know, right? Lee hangs out at the old bootlegger mansion with those dogs.
Lady Rainicorn::: I'm going to need this. (나 이거 가져간다.)
Roy:::So much anger. 
TV:::Hey, Lee, this is a cool game being strapped in this wheel.♩I've got a new best friend.♩
TV:::♩Named Lee♩
TV:::Uhh... I don't like this. No, Lee, why are you doing this?
Lee::: Faster. (더 빨리 돌려.)
Lee:::The Crystal Mergence of Destruction!! (수정 파괴 활성화는 내꺼야!!)
Lady Rainicorn:::Lee!
Lee::: Lady?
TV::: Mommy!
Lee::: Get her, boys! (쟤네들 못 도망가게 잡아!)
Lee:::Why don't you join my cause, baby?! (하하하! 자기도 들어와! 우리 개 선호당에!)
Lady Rainicorn::: I thought you were against dogs! (나는 니가 개들을 증오하는 줄 알았지!)
Lee::: That was then... Now the Rainicorns are ruling the roost! (그때는 그랬지... 근데 이제는 레이니콘들이 이 세상을 지배하잖아!)
Lee::: Nobody is going to stand in my way this time! (이번엔, 누구도 내 계획을 방해할 수 없어!)
TV:::Hi, mom. How do you know Lee?
Lee::: You're too late! (이미 늦어버렸어!)Blblblblbl 
Lee:::Yeah! Okay, now how.. How do I work this thing?? (하하하, 그래! 가만 이거 이제 어떻게... 어떻게 하는 거지?)
Lady::: Ahh! TV, Run! (아아! TV, 도망가!)
TV:::Um, Okay. 
TV::: It's a good thing I didn't sell this box.
Lady Rainicorn::: Lets go back, TV. I have to get this thing out of here and back to Ooo. (TV야, 인제 가자. 우리 이거 다시 우로 가져가야 해.) 
TV::: Yeah, no, I think I'll stay here in the Crystal Dimension for a while. I want to learn to be cool like you. More independent and everything.
Lady Rainicorn:::::: Ok, sweetie. If that's what you want. Later, my boy! (그게 정말 니가 원하는 거라면, 그렇게 해. 금방 다시 보자, 우리 아들!)
TV:::Love you, mom.Being independent is awesome.
TV::: Do you guys have any food?
