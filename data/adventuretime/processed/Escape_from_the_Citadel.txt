Finn:::Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Finn:::Look, Jake.More guardians. The Citadel, I presume.
Jake:::Likely so.
Finn:::Hey. Do you think maybe one of them could be my dad?
Jake:::Eh, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him.
Finn:::Right, right. That makes sense.
Finn:::Hey! The Lich again! This must be where the prison cells be at. See? Good riddance, too. I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk-clapper. Some people just make the world a worse place to be in just by being around, Jake.That's right. Bad apples. Lock 'em all up, I say. At the bottom of the ocean, where it's too dark to see.
Jake:::Look at that weird ol' kid over there. He looks just like you.Man, look at his clo—
Finn:::Daddyyy!Aah!All locked up in there. D-Do you think maybe he's a criminal too?
Jake::: Well, it had crossed my mind.
Finn::: Jeez, man! Now I wish I hadn't said all that stuff before. Now my heart feels yellow and green.Maybe we shouldn't even have come here—waah!?Jake, what did you do?
Jake:::It wasn't me! It came from up there!
Finn::: He's melting the crystal all up!Breaking cats out left and right! Turning cats gray! Did he trick us again!? I think he did!
Martin:::Hey, kid!Hey, do me a favor. Get me out of here, huh?This fire smells crazy!
Martin:::Thanks, kid. Now, where'd you guys park your Star Skipper?This place is coming down quick, and I mean quick, like zip zip. Like wow, like boom boom wow.
Finn:::Oh. We... we don't have a Star Skipper.
Jake::: Also, Finn'ss your son.
Martin:::Whaaat? No Star Skipper?
Jake:::Ahem! I said, Finn's your son. He came a long way to meet you.
Martin:::Son? Oh, hey, good for you, kid. In other news, I still gotta get out of here and the ground is melting. Huh?It's all pooling in the center.
Finn:::Hey, um... I... I wanted to ask you something. I... well...Hey, wait up!Dad, wait!Dad, I need to ask you —- aah! 
Jake::: 
Starchie:::Aaah!
Void Caster:::Gree-nah-gah-ga-ba-ga-ga-da-da-ga-ga. 
Jake::: Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me, if both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry yours off too.
Finn:::What? No.Listen, you don't gotta worry about a thing, Jake ol' pal.We just need to defeat those five space villains, hijack the shard they're hijacking and sail it home to safety.Easy peasy.
Martin:::Yeah, Jake, smarten up. As soon as the last guardian dies, the fighting stops. See? He's bitin' the dust right now.
Finn:::Aahh! Uh oh! 
Martin:::It's-- It's okay. It's okay.You just gotta fetch me a gob of that guardian blood, son. It's got that good nooch that keeps us young in the crystal.
Finn:::Nooch?
Martin:::Come on now, partner.No dawdling, yer old man needs ya. 
Martin:::Atta boy, Flynn! Do it for yer old man! Yeah, yeah, just get right in there! Don't be shy. Yeah!
Martin:::Hey, good job, son! Now, rub some of that sap on my leg there. Make sure to get it into the chicken wing hole.
Finn::: Dad...
Martin:::Martin!
Finn:::Okay, M-Martin. We need to talk.
Martin:::Yeah, okay, kid, but hurry it up. I'm trying to act cool here, but this thing really stings!
Finn::: Why'd you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby!?
Martin:::Oh... I mean... Heh. You know me. I'm a funny guy!
Martin:::Ahhh, I dunno. It was a long time ago.Who knows,maybe you left me!
Martin::: But hey, daddy's back!You and me, daddy and baby, or should I say...baby and daddy.Now slap that sap!Whoa! Would ya look at that!Smooth like new.Pssh, couldn't fix the boot too, huh?
Jake:::Dude!!S'mores important junk happening! Look!
Finn:::It's time to peel bananas on this fool, as a family!How about it, Martin?Dad?
Martin::: I gotta run to the store!
Finn::: Hrm.Wha?
The Lich:::Fall.
The Lich:::You are alone, child.There is only darkness for you, and only death for your people.These Ancients are just the beginning.
The Lich:::I will command a great and terrible army; and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am beyond strength. I am the end.And I have come for you, Finn. 
Finn::: What? You don't like this stuff, huh?Whoa!Right in the doorbell.Dad.Jake, finish off the Lich. I gotta go catch my dad.
Jake:::Finn, forget that loser!
Finn:::Dad, wait!
Martin:::Hey, cool guys. Looking for a new boss?Chew faster, that guy's really moving.
Finn::: Dad! Stop!
Jake::: Finn! 
Finn::: Martin, I won't let you escape!
Martin::: Hey, hey, you're a void caster, right? We gotta put somegas in this buggy.
Jake:::Finn! Let go! He's not worth it!
Martin:::Oh, gross. Pedal to the metal!
Martin:::Hey, what about air—?
Jake:::It'll be okay, dude.
Finn::: I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right?
Jake:::Oh, yeah, that's the good news::: I didn't have to! One sec.Up you go! Check this out!Brand new baby. The Lich is super cute now, and he smells real neat!That sap rebooted him or something.I like him a lot.
Starchie:::Over here, fellas! Next stop, the Candy Kingdom. Previous stop, this weird place.
Tree Trunks:::Mr. Pig, I think we should get a d—
Jake::: Okay, run. Go, go, go!
Tree Trunks:::Oh!Oh, this changes everything!
The Lich:::Hello!
