Jake::: Loot, bro!
Finn:::Gear dumped, bro!How about this room, bro?
Jake::: Looks like a brolicious room to relax in and play video games... bro.
Finn:::Home, sweet home, bro.
Ice King::: Yeah, you said it. I've been home this whole time.
Jake:::I keep forgetting that he lives here now.
Finn::: Just until Gunter finishes rebuilding the Ice Kingdom.
Ice King:::What y'all whisperin' about?Hehe! Ex-"squeeze" me. 
Jake::: Ice King, we've told you a thousand times::: this couch ain't for cuddlin'.
Ice King:::Sure it is.
Jake:::It isn't!
Ice King:::Mm, it's cozy.
Finn::: It's not that bad, Jake.
Ice King:::See?
Jake::: Finn, can I speak to you in the kitchen?
Ice King:::Oh, hey, Jake, can you bring me a sandwich?Sandwich?
Jake:::It's time to kick Ice King out!! 
Ice King::: Don't forget the bread! Haha!
Finn::: Look, I hear you. But we can't kick him out because I still feel guilty about junking up his crib. Hey, what if we check him into a hotel room?
Jake:::Hmmm? 
Finn:::What's that?
Jake:::Checking him to a hotel room.
Ice King:::Oooh! Sandwich time! 
Finn:::Hey, Simon, how would you like to stay in the Coolest Hotel?
Jake:::Lumpy Space Princess stays there. That's how cool it is.
Finn:::We'll even put you up for few weeks until your place is ready.
Ice King:::Ahh, but that sounds lonely. I just like to stay here with you guys! Having roommates is nice! It keeps me out of my head. Gunther says only "Wenk!" What's up with that?
Finn:::Hehe, yeah?
Jake:::Finn, I'm ready to murder the Ice King.
Finn:::No. I-I have another idea.
Ice King:::Oop. 
Finn:::Oh, my gosh! Someone's at the door. We have a doorbell now. We'll get it.
