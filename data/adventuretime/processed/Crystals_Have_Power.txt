Tree Trunks::: Yes, Finn, it's me, Tree Trunks.but in this world I am known as Quartzion the Crystal Queen. 
Finn:::Oh my grosh, you're alive! 
Tree Trunks:::Oh, I'm more than alive, Finn. After I ate that Crystal Apple in the scary dark forest, I was transported to this crystal dimension where I become ruler of the crystal men. And the crystal men are all in love with me.
Crystal Guardians:::Love you Quartzion! Quartzion, I love you! Quartzion, we love you! 
Tree Trunks:::Yes, yes I know, but you love... is not enoughI wanted you, Finn, so you could be transformed into my sexy crystal king.
Finn:::Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas with crystal power!
Tree Trunks:::Finn, it's not sexy for a king to call his queen bananas! 
Finn:::Jake, you totally gotta stop her!
Jake:::I'll try man, but I'm still figuring out my bizz,here I come, Tree Trunks!Taste my gentle rubs!
Tree Trunks:::Whoa there, don't you put your junk on my trunk!

Jake:::But dad, you said I was going to hurt everybody!
Joshua:::Yeah, every-bod-y.

Finn:::I'm okay toooo! 
Tree Trunks:::Oh, Finn, I was trapped here for so long and all I could think about was you and how your so nice to me and I, and I just wanted to say... I think... you're cute and I like you.
