Jake:::You're totally slow dude, speed up them gams.
Finn:::Auh... I'm not used, uh... to running on all fours! Oahh!
Jake:::Ready to admit it's harder than it looks?
Finn:::I'll never admit anything to you. Hey where'd you go?
Jake:::Heh heh heh.
Finn::: Whoa aoh oh! Umpf! Okay I admit it's, it's harder than I thought.
Jake:::Actually you did pretty good! Hey check it out!
Finn:::Whoa!
Jake:::Looks like a giant dead turtle.
Finn:::I think it's some kind of city of... 
Hag::: Thieves! It's the City of Thieves! Be warned boy! All who enter the city are destined to be come thieves themselves!Even <i>you</i>.
Finn:::I would't become a thief lady! I'm a pretty good guy.
Jake:::Yeah, get your glasses on grandma, this kid is pure. In fact he's about to help that little crying kid. 
Finn::: Oh, whoa!
Hag:::Be warned!
Finn:::Enough lady!Hey little girl, are you okay?
Penny::: Please, don't steal anything from me!
Finn:::Whoa! We wouldn't do that. We're heroes.
Jake::: We want to turn your frown all the way around. Penny:::Ahh!
Finn::: Jake!
Jake:::I'll face the other way, but I'm gonna keep doing this.
Finn:::So what's wrong?
Penny:::Oh, it was terrible. I was trying to sell my flowers out here in the desert, when these two thieves came and stole my whole basket! Then ran into the city.
Finn:::The city?
Hag:::...of Thieves!
Jake:::Oh boy.
Hag:::Heed my warning boy::: enter the city, and you'll come out a thief!Finn:::Never.I'll get this girl's flowers back-
Penny:::My name is Penny.
Finn:::I'll get Penny's flowers back, and come out of that city as pure as the driven snow. Let's go Jake!
Jake:::Yeah! We're gonna purify that city!
Finn::: Cool.
Jake::: Crud.
Big Guy:::My ring!
Finn::: Stop thief!
Finn::: Stop!
Big Guy::: My ruby!
Finn::: Stop, baby! Don't steal!
Finn::: Don't steal, Mr. Turtle!
Penny::: Finn, it's <i>hopeless</i> to try stopping a thief here. Everyone steals from each other. It's redoodoodiculous!
Finn::: Penny! Never say that!
Penny::: Redoodoodiculous?
Finn::: No! The whole thing you said. About hopelessness. 'Cause I'm gonna get your basket back from whoever took it. And then I'm going tobeat my purity into them!
Jake::: And then I'm gonna beat your purity outta them.And then beat a sandwich into them!And then beat them to the <i>punch</i>! And then punch 'em!
Finn::: We can beat these thieves while we search for Penny's flower basket!
Jake::: Okay.
Finn::: Hey turd-le (turtle)! I'm gonna kick your butt! Also, have you seen this little girl's flower basket?
Jake::: You're going down, turtle!
Jake::: Woah! I want jets!
Finn::: Come back, Crossbow Guy!
Crossbow Guy::: My crossbow!
Penny::: Hey, my basket! That's my basket!
Finn::: Don't worry, Penny. We'll get it right after I deal with this guy!Stealing's wrong, doofus!
Penny:::This is fun, Finn!
Two-Headed Thief Head 1::: My bro!
Two-Headed Thief Head 2::: My body!
Cyclops::: I'm gonna steal your flower basket, wizard!
Wizard Thief::: Pancake, pancake, pancake.
Two-Headed Thief Head 2::: Ow, brotha'!
Cyclops::: My glasses!
Phil::: My jammies!
Phil::: My glasses!
Finn::: There it goes!
Finn::: I will smite thee, goblin thief!
Goblin Thief #1::: You stole that basket from me!
Goblin Thief #2::: No I didn't!Hey! Gimme that! I stole it first! I'll use my sword on you!
Goblin Thief #2::: Hey! 
Finn:::You there! It's time to step into the purification chamber, son!Hey!
Finn:::How are we supposed to get that basket back if it keeps being stolen?! 
Jake::: Hey! We can steal a new one from that guy!He's got lots of flower baskets. And boots! I'd like to steal me one of them pairs of boots, especially.
Finn::: No, Jake. We can't steal. We have to stay pure!
Jake:::Okay.
Penny::: I have an idea! My mom used to tell me that there's a King of Thieves who lives in the center of the city, and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower. Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest!
Finn::: That's a great idea, Penny!
Penny::: There's one thing, though. The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier. Which magically keeps thieves out.
Finn::: Have you forgotten?! We three ain't thieves! We're pure! Right, Jake?Jake?
Jake:::Just gotta steal these boots...
Finn::: Jake!
Jake::: Huh?
Baskets & Boots owner:::Hey! Go away!
Finn::: What are you doin', man?
{{Template:::L:::Jake:::It's the city, it's getting to me. Help me, Finn!
{{Template:::L:::Finn:::I'm here for ya buddy. 
{{Template:::L:::Jake:::Thank you Finn, thank you.
{{Template:::L:::
{{Template:::L:::Finn::: Nooo!I won't let you become a thief! 
Jake::: Uh, what are these? 
Finn::: Bells. That way, I'll hear you if you try to steal again.
Jake::: Oh. Hmm. 
Penny::: The King of Thieves' tower is right up here.
Finn::: Woah.You read to pass through, Penny?
Penny::: I'm too afraid! Is it okay if I wait out here?
Finn::: Sure. C'mon, let's go, Jake!
Jake:::Comin'! 
Finn::: Jake, where'd you get those boots?
Jake::: Huh, what? What boots?Oh, no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me!
Finn:::Jake, you're a thief now! You won't be able to get in anymore!
Jake::: Yes, I can.Oh. 
Finn:::It's up to me, now.
Penny::: Legend says you'll find the loot in the King of Thieves' chest. Good luck, Finn! Oh, yeah, and that high window is the only entrance.
Finn::: Hmm. Alright, wish me luck!
Jake::: She already did, man.
Finn::: Oh, yeah. Right.Great, now I gotta climb down?!Huh?The King of Thieves!Sorry to trespass, I just... Uh, hello?The chest! In it's in his chest! Thanks! 
Jake::: You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore.
Finn:::I got it, guys!
Penny::: The chest! Gimme that! 
Finn::: Huh?
Jake::: Woah, woah, woah. Easy, kid.
Finn::: What?!Is you basket under all that gold?
Penny::: Of course it's not! I set you up to steal this chest of gold! I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief!
Finn::: But you're just a cute little girl!
Penny::: And, I'm a thief!
Finn::: Well, if this isn't yours, I'm gonna return it right now!Huh?Why can't I...?
Penny::: Because you stole something in the city! Now you're a thief!
Finn::: No!No!!! What have I done?! What have I become?!
Penny::: You've become a thief, stupid! 
Finn:::My hands. They're all dirty. Covered in the dust of a criminal act! I'm a thief!
Hag::: Oh, what did I tell you, boy? This city will get you, no matter how pure you think you are!I was right.
Jake::: Hey, that's enough from you, Hag!Finn?
Finn::: Don't touch me! I'm impure, man! Unfit to be a hero! Unfit to be your friend.
Jake::: Come on, Finn, keep it together!
Finn::: No, Jake. This is a one-way path, down a jacked-up road. And I gotta walk it... alone.
Jake::: I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city. You're my buddy. Besides, I stole these boots. These super-big style boots. So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We gotta walk this filthy path together!
Finn::: Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny.
Jake::: Cowabunga! 
Finn::: Cowabunga, indeed.
Penny:::Mmm. Yes. Yeah.Wha? Is someone there?! 
Finn:::It's me, Penny. The hero whose purity you stole! And I'm here to enact my revenge upon <i>you</i>! 
Jake::: Hi, Penny.
Penny::: Finn, please don't punch my lights out! I'm just a poor, homeless baby girl.
Finn::: I trusted you, Penny. You made me steal. And you took my purity. You ruined me!
Penny::: I'm sorry, Finn.Let me give you some uh, gems, or some gold, or uh, have someknife in your neck! 
Jake::: Watch out, Finn! 
Finn::: Thanks, dude.
Jake::: Yeah, dude.
Penny::: You may have soiled my purity, but I think you can still come out clean.C'mon, Jake! 
Penny::: No! No! 
Jake::: Nice work, dude.
Finn::: She's purified!
Penny:::I feel...clean! Like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone! Thank you F and J! I haven't felt like this since I was young!
Finn::: You're welcome.
Jake::: Woah, dude!The soap got on us, too!
Finn::: We're clean!
Finn and Jake::: Yes! 
Finn::: This good deed we did has purified us once again. We're virgin islands! 
Penny::: Finn, thanks for the second chance to live a pure life.
Finn::: And you know what that means, Penny. No more stealing! 
Penny::: Never again.
Finn::: Well, I think it's time for us to get the math out of here.
Penny:::I'm going to miss you, Finn!
Finn::: I'll miss you, too.
Penny:::G'bye!
Jake::: Woah, dude. Why are you naked? 
Finn:::PENNY!
