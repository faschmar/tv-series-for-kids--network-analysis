Rag Wizard::: Faster!
Rag Wizard::: Faster! She's in danger!
Jake::: Who is he talking about?
Finn::: I have no idea.
Jake::: What?! Then why am I running so hard?
Finn::: Because...
Rag Wizard::: Because she's in trouble!
Finn and Jake::: Who is?!
Rag Wizard::: Marceline!
Finn::: Faster, Jake!
Jake::: She's in trouble! 
Jake::: Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline?
Rag Wizard::: I'm her spirit animal.
Jake::: Oh.
Finn::: Marceline! What's wrong with her?
Rag Wizard::: She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber.
Finn::: Tell us how to break the spell.
Rag Wizard::: I'll transport you into Marceline's mind where you will walk through her memories and find the memory core.
Jake::: Then what?
Rag Wizard::: Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself. At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality.
Jake::: But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself?
Rag Wizard::: Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms. Just legs.Yeah, there we go... oh. 
Finn::: What? What'd you do to my forehead?
Rag Wizard::: When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here, take this.It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head.
Finn::: Like this? 
Rag Wizard::: Yep, like that. Feel sleepy?
Finn and Jake::: Mmhm.
Rag Wizard::: Good. Sleep now. But know this! If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep... forever!
Finn and Jake::: 
Rag Wizard::: And ever. And ever.
Jake:::Did it work?
Finn:::Ugh, ah. I can't tell. I don't feel like I'm inside Marceline's memories.
Jake::: Me neither. Huh?
Jake::: Whoa. Whoa!
Finn::: So... if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline?
Jake::: Hmm... there she is!Hey, little Marcy.
Young Marceline::: Who are you guys?
Finn::: We're Finn and Jake.
Jake::: We're your friends!
Young Marceline::: Hambo is my only friend. See?You need another eyeball surgery, pal. Lucky for you, we found a donor.Eyeball! Nurse, hand me the string. Yes, doctor. It's our last piece. Hold still.I'm hurting you because I love you.
Jake::: Ahem!
Young Marceline::: What are you guys still doing here?
Finn::: We're trying to wake you up.
Jake::: Do you know where your memory core is?
Young Marceline::: Nope, but there might be anything behind that cellar door, and it rhymes with memory core!
Jake::: Ooo! Ooo! Could be jams and pickles down there!Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it! Ooo, ice cream
Finn::: I want some! Huh? 
Jake:::Come on, Finn!
Finn::: Yo, man.
Hunson Abadeer::: Wha?
Finn::: Don't eat those.
Hunson Abadeer:::Marceline!
Teenage Marceline:::Daddy, why?
Finn::: It's our treehouse. This must be when Marceline lived here.
Marceline::: I'm so glad we're doing this, Ash.
Ash::: Yeah, me too. Oh, hey, wait. Watch this--I've been practicing. 
Rose::: Marceline! I love, I love.
Ash::: 
Jake::: Who's this guy supposed to be?
Finn::: Ash, I guess.
Marceline::: 
Finn:::This place reeks.
Jake::: Yo, man, your thing is glowing.
Finn::: My what?Oh, my thing.
Jake::: We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on.
Finn::: Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again.
Ash::: Hey, open your eyes, look at this, Mar-Mar. Check it out. It's my new wand.These cherry blossoms, look, look as close as you can, and they're real.
Marceline:::Wow. Awesome. Where'd you get the money for that thing?
Ash:::Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a Witch.
Marceline::: You what? Are you crazy? That was my favorite thing in the whole world!
Ash::: That's why it's so valuable, genius--for potions.
Cherry Blossom Ghost::: You're not, a genius. You're not, a genius.
Marceline::: That's the last straw, Ash! That's it! You're a psycho jerk, and you ruined my life.
Ash::: But--but not all of it!
Marceline::: IT'S OVER, YOU PSYCHO!! 
Jake:::This way, Finn! Check out this whacked out memory crack! It's ba-nay-nay down here!
Finn::: The core!
Jake::: All these orbs must be her memories.
Finn::: How are we supposed to know which one to grab?
Jake::: Play hot-cold with your forehead!
Finn::: Alright.Hot or cold?
Jake::: Cold. Definitely cold.
Jake::: Warmer. Warmer, warmer! Whoa, hot. Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one!
Finn:::Huh? Hey, you have arms.
Ash::: That's right, genius.
Jake::: Huh?
Finn::: You lied to us.
Ash::: The important thing is... Marceline's awake. 
Finn::: Marcie, Marcie! You're okay.
Marceline::: Quit touching my hair!
Finn::: You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend.
Marceline::: That's Ash.
Finn and Jake::: Ash?
Marceline::: He's not my friend; he's my boyfriend.
Finn and Jake::: What?!
Ash::: That's right, babe.
Marceline::: Ash, what's going on?
Ash::: Just picking up my girl for a night on the town; at my place.
Marceline::: That's sweet. 
Finn and Jake::: What?!
Marceline::: Oh, grow up you guys. I'm going to go freshen up.
Ash::: That's a relief.
Marceline::: Oh, Ash.
Finn::: What?
Ash::: Don't you guys get it? I outbrained you. That wasn't the memory of a sleep spell you brought me. That memory was our break-up!
Marceline:::It's over, you psycho!! 
Ash::: That's enough of that?
Jake::: Oh, no!
Finn::: What?
Ash::: Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar, let's go.
Finn::: No, Marceline!
Ash::: Ashicus Flyicus. 
Finn::: They're gone, man. He took her!
Jake::: Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent.Ah. Follow me.
Jake::: I could smell them in there. So what's the plan?
Finn::: Um. Okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed until Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline.
Jake:::Nice. 
Tiny Goblin::: My house! What's happening? No, don't hurt me!
Jake::: No, no, sorry.
Tiny Goblin::: 
Jake::: Shh, shh, wait!
Tiny Goblin::: Help, somebody help me!
Ash:::What's all this hullabaloo?!
Tiny Goblin::: Help! Help!
Ash::: Hey, hold it, you, get back here! 
Marceline::: Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here! Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals.
Finn::: Yeah, okay. Sorry Marceline, I'll go. I just gotta show you something first.
Marceline::: Hello? Finn?
Finn::: Hey, there you are. 
Marceline::: Finn, what's going on? What is this place?
Finn::: It's my old house. That magic powder--it put you in my memories. Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of you breaking up with him. But it's okay because I saw the memory. Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See? 
Ash:::Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a witch.
Marceline::: It's over, you psycho!!
Marceline::: Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now.
Finn::: You gonna be okay, Marceline?
Marceline::: Yeah. Thanks, Finn, I...
Ash::: Yo, Mar-Mar. Whatâ€”What's with the chump? C'mon, I said no chumps.Ash gets hungies at eight o' clock. You need to get back in the kitchen and make me din-ner.
Marceline::: 
Ash::: I want a turkey sandwich with to-ma-to.
Ash::: Also pickles.
Ash::: Ohh...I can't see...Somebody call my mom!
