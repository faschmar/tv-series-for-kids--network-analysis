Jake::: Finn, lunch is ready!
Finn::: Ugh, what are you cooking?
Jake:::It's good! I learned it from Rainicorn.
Finn:::I'm not eatin' that. It smells funny.
Jake:::Dude, this took me, like—
Finn:::Let's go over to Tree Trunks's and get some apple pie! Apple pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Let's go! 
Jake:::Whoa!Eh.
Finn::: Tree Trunks!
Finn::: Tree Trunks! Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks::: Apples... my apples...
Jake:::Apples?
Tree Trunks:::You!You took my apples! 
Finn:::Whoa, whoa!Tree Trunks, it's us, Finn and Jake!
Tree Trunks:::Finn... and, and Jake?
Finn:::It's okay, Tree Trunks. We're here to help you. Just tell us what happened.
Tree Trunks::: They took 'em. They took all of 'em.
Jake:::All of what?
Tree Trunks:::Apples. My apples that I raised with love from, from mere seedlings. Without my special apples, I won't be able to bake any more apple pies.
Finn & Jake:::NOOOOOOOO!
Finn:::Don't you worry, Tree Trunks. We'll find those thieves and bring them to justice.
Tree Trunks:::Let me show you the crime scene.You see, boys::: scads of apple trees but, but no apples.
Finn:::Hmm. Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks:::No, Finn, they didn't touch my rocks, or my birds, or my flowers, or, or nothing.
Finn:::Hm. Well, I don't see any footprints. What'cha got, Jake?
Jake::: No ghost doodies. Oh. Oh, wait.Oh, no. No.
Finn:::Hm. Tree Trunks, is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up?
Tree Trunks:::Oh, no, Finn. I take great care to assure that-that I'm loved by even the most heinous cretins—
Jake:::Hey, guys, I found something! Look!
Tree Trunks:::Uh!
Raggedy Princess:::Oh, heheh, hey, Finn. Heheh.
Finn:::Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess. Have you seen anything fishy going on?
Raggedy Princess:::Um, no, heheh. I've been kinda down in this hole for a long time.I got knocked down here by some ne'er-do-wells. It was terrible. I was so scared.
Tree Trunks:::Ne'er-do-wells? They stole my apples.I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty!
Finn::: Awesome. Where do we find these guys?
Jake:::Oh, the Candy Tavern, man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses.
Jake:::Don't worry, I stopped doing that a long time ago. I didn't know it was wrong.
Tree Trunks:::Okay, you two, let's get going.
Candy Tavern Person:::Whoa!
Tree Trunks::: Oh, my!
Finn:::Uh, does Princess Bubblegum know about this place?
Jake:::Be cool, man. You're gonna queer the deal.
Finn:::Oh, yeah. Try not to act suspicious, Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks:::Okay, I won't.
Finn & Tree Trunks:::Where—?
Finn:::Oh. 
Tree Trunks:::Where's my dang apples?
Finn:::Oh,Tree Trunks, you're so silly. But, but listen, you wouldn't happen to have seen any—I don't know—apples around, have you?
Bartender:::"Seen any apples?" Y'all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions... almost like you're trying to solve somethin'.
Finn:::What? Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.
Bartender:::Mmm... clean, too. Almost like somedo-gooders!
Jake:::Hold on, we gotta go potty.
Finn:::Dang. They almost got us, but I think we blend in pretty well now.
Tree Trunks::: This, this toilet paper's drying my mouth all up.
Finn:::Uh, Tree Trunks, don't eat that.Here.You gotta watch her, man!
Tree Trunks:::Oh, I look just like an army brat!
Bartender:::What can I do for you?
Finn::: You know where a guy might maybe score some apples? 
Bartender:::Well, when you put it like that.... A couple of buddies I know have some apples for sale. I'll show you.
Bartender:::Hey, fellas, these folks been askin' 'bout your... apples?
Jaybird::: Okay, show 'em the apples, Smudge.
Jaybird:::Grab 'em!
Jaybird:::You go back, and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples 'cause they're ours now!
Finn:::Wha-what boss?
Jaybird:::Your boss! Dr. J?
Finn:::We don't know any Dr. J.
Jaybird::: Liars! Come on, Smudge...gonna take my apples.
Jake:::What just happened?
Finn:::I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks' apples also stole Dr. J's apples, and they thought we were workin' for him!
Tree Trunks:::Finn? Finn.
Finn:::Hm?
Tree Trunks:::This could be dangerous, a-and if you want to go back home, I understand, but I need to do this.
Finn:::Yeah, Tree Trunks, me too.
Jake:::Hey, Finn.
Finn:::Hm?
Jake::: What's that on your face, buddy?
Finn:::Oh, that guy bopped me one. Must've had a ring on.
Jake:::Y'know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before. Yeah, right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes.
Finn:::What?!
Jake:::I didn't know it was wrong.
Jake::: Yeah, you see? That guy must work here or somethin'.
Finn::: Hello?
Wormo::: Who's the heck happening? What?
Finn:::Uh, we're here about the apples?
Wormo:::Oh, okay. Let's see your ring.
Finn:::Um...
Jake:::Here. 
Wormo::: Come on in. Follow this guy. 
Wormo::: My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples. A whole crate. 
Finn:::What the?
Wormo:::What's wrong, guy?
Finn:::These aren't apples.
Wormo:::Oh, ya didn't mean diamonds? All ne'er-do-wells call diamonds "apples." Like calling money "bread" or rock-knockers "butter-slaps."
Jaybird::: Hey, Wormo, we're back—what the?!What are they doing here?
Wormo:::They're here for the apples.
Jaybird:::That's the dang Dr. J gang, Wormo! Grab 'em!
Tree Trunks:::Um, sir?I promise if you let us go, we won't tell no one about your apples.
Wormo:::Feed 'em to the pig.
Smudge:::Yeah, the pig.
Jaybird:::Heheh, yeah, all right. 
Mr. Pig:::Uh, I'm sorry, y'all. They're makin' me do this. I-I'll try to make it quick.
Dr. J:::Hold it!
Jaybird:::Dr. J! 
Dr. J:::Yeah, yeah, and I want my apples back.
Jaybird & Dr. J:::Get 'em, boys!
Finn:::Aw, don't cry, Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks:::But we're never gonna find those apples.
Mr. Pig:::Apples? You guys looking for apples?
Jake:::Uh, yeah, why?
Mr. Pig:::'Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room.
Jake:::Wait, you mean "apples" as "diamonds"?
Mr. Pig:::No.
Jake:::"Apples" as "apples"?
Mr. Pig:::Yep.
Finn:::You mean apples that we eat?
Mr. Pig:::Yes.
Tree Trunks:::With all due respect, Mr. Pig, sir, my apples were stolen by a dirty, rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail.
Mr. Pig:::I'm just telling you the facts, ma'am. What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet.They sound scared.
Tree Trunks:::Well, I hate to tell you this, boys, but there's no apples in this closet.You see, uh, I'm the only one who knows how to open this closet. 
Tree Trunks:::Oh, so I was the apple thief after all.
Finn:::No, Tree Trunks, that's preposterous.
Tree Trunks:::No, Finn, I'm a criminal,and I need to pay the price.
Banana Guard :::Banana Guard speaking.
Tree Trunks:::Uh, this is Tree Trunks. I've done somethin' horrible, and I want you to come over and arrest me.
Finn:::Tree Trunks, you don't need to do this.
Tree Trunks:::Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime. Goodbye.
Finn:::Tree Trunks.
Banana Guard:::Ah, this is hard to watch. I'm gonna look away.
Banana Guard:::This place could use a scarecrow.
Finn:::Huh? Wait, what'd you say?
Banana Guard:::Uh, I-I said this place could use a scarecrow.
Finn:::A scarecrow, no footprints, all those magpies on the roof, Raggedy Princess in the ditch, and all the apples in Tree Trunks's closet.
Banana Guard :::Boy, this place could use a scarecrow.
Finn:::That's it!I knew it!
Finn:::The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole!
Jake:::And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree!
Finn:::Yes. And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off!
Tree Trunks:::Does this mean I'm innocent?
Jake:::As innocent as a baby's butt cheek!
Finn:::Awesome! This calls for a celebration! You know what that means, Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks:::I'ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted. 
Banana Guards:::Whoa.
Tree Trunks::: Uh, you boys better stick around if you want a bite of my apple pie. 
Banana Guard:::She slapped my butt!
