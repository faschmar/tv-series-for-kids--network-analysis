Peppermint Butler::: Evil is rising. In vile power, the fiend walks among us again. The Vampire King. With all my investigations into the supernatural, I should know better, but I can't help it. I'm dying to see him in person!I probably will die if I see him in person.
Peppermint Butler:::Hello?
Jake:::Yo, yo, yo, yo! Bubblegum sent me for the bucket.
Peppermint Butler:::Dozo. 
Jake:::Merci and adios.
Peppermint Butler:::Wait! Uh... how's it going?
Jake:::It's good, you know? Uh, Marceline's got all her powers back. She's getting ready to give the Vampire King a big, fat whompin', uh, I hope.
Peppermint Butler:::Um, while that's going down, do you think you could ask the V.K. to sign something for me?
Jake:::That would be weird. You're weird. 
Marceline:::I dreamed about you while I was in my poison coma. I was old and withered, and you were still nice and pink.
Princess Bubblegum::: You think I'm nice? Oh, brains! I lost count.
Marceline:::That's okay. I'm done with bat jacks.I have this weird feeling in my tums.
Princess Bubblegum:::'Cause you're scared of The Vampire King?
Marceline:::No, it's not fear. I know what that feels like. So, maybe it's...love?Oh! What is it?!
Jake::: It's the herald of a new snack dawn! 
Marceline::: Oh, yeah.
Princess Bubblegum:::I arranged a snacky-snack for the team.
Jake::: I love you, Bonnibel.
Marceline:::Yeah, me too, Bonnibel.Ohh!Holy macaroni! Can we do this all the time?
Princess Bubblegum:::Later, we can, all the time. But, for now-now, we got to get our plan together.
Marceline::: Easy. First, we take down the V.K, kill him, destroy him, and...kill him! 
Jake:::I like this plan! It's got good bones!
Princess Bubblegum:::Well, the devil's in the details. Like, how do we even find him?
Vampire King:::I come to you! 
Marceline:::Vampire King!
Vampire King:::In the flesh!
Marceline:::Not for long, sucker! 
Vampire King:::Whoa! I just want to talk.
Jake:::Oh really! Why don't you step inside for a nice chat? 
Vampire King:::No, thank you. 
Vampire King:::Just hear me out, Marceline.
Princess Bubblegum::: Hear this!
Marceline::: Ouch!
Vampire King:::Will you calm down and listen to-
Finn:::YAHHH! 
Finn::: Shoot.
Princess Bubblegum::: Sorry.
Vampire King:::Stay calm, and nobody gets hurt. I know what you must think of me, and you'd be right.My thirst for blood is an awesome force. But in these new times, I have a chance to try a different course. 
Vampire King:::I think I wanna-
Finn:::Roll out!Thorn arm!ACTIVATE!
Finn::: You gonna help, or what?
Vampire King::: Let me finish my thought.
Finn::: Stake you!Okay, go ahead.
Vampire King:::This is the old way. Agents of darkness and light in a tug-of-war. But now, a creature can step out of that struggle. In this age, why would I want to be the Vampire King anymore?
Princess Bubblegum::: I don't know, why would you?
Vampire King:::I wouldn't. I submit.Take the vampire essence from my blood. Free me from the shackles of my station.
Marceline::: YAHHHH!FINN! What the heck?!
Finn:::It's against my code to strike a foe who's raised his bottom to the sky. The Enchiridion explicitly states so.
Marceline:::Dem are your rules.
Finn:::Dem a good rule dhough. 
Marceline:::Outta my way!
Finn:::Ep, ep, ep, ep, ep! Look.Look at these babies. These pleadin' puppies. 
Finn:::Whoops. Shoulda staked him.
Vampire King:::How many times do you wanna do this, Marceline? Our lives have magnetized. We're in a negative loop.But we can change our outcome this time! 
Marceline:::I like the outcome where you get staked!
Vampire King:::And you become a vampire?
Vampire King:::Marceline.I know I was ruthless in the past. But tell me, what's the one thing you've noticed about the world, since you beat me all those hundreds of years ago?
Marceline:::Everything repeats over and over again. No one learns anything, 'cause no one lives long enough to see the pattern, I guess.
Vampire King:::But you've lived long enough.
Marceline:::I know. Duh.
Vampire King:::And you still think this is the right way? Fighting me?
Marceline:::The other way's like a black hole; an unknown.
Vampire King:::So let's consult a witch-
Marceline::: No witches.
Vampire King::: I'm not afraid of the unknown!I have the power--to change destiny! Queen of vampires! You weigh the scales of fate. Spill my guts, or face the unknown. Either way, I will not bite. For turning you would subjugate me to the wheel of fortune. And I am a king, not a hamster. My path runs straight into the void, on a sick, flaming chariot!Stake me. I will not hide.Do it, chicken! You make me sick!
Marceline:::Okay, dag! We'll take your stupid thing out!
Vampire King::: My what?
Marceline:::Your dang vamp juice, come on!
Vampire King:::Cool. 
Finn:::Let 'er rip!
Princess Bubblegum:::Wait!
Jake:::Whoops. 
Marceline::: Truce, you guys. 
Vampire King:::No funny business.
Princess Bubblegum:::No funny business us, or you? 
Marceline:::Him.
Jake::: What happened to your pants?
Jake:::Hold that thought! 
Finn::: Finish him! Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam-
Marceline:::Finn, you can stop.
Finn:::Oh, okay, now we're stopping.Sorry, dude.
Vampire King::: It's chill.See? No funny business.
Finn::: Hey, Jake.
Jake::: What?
Finn::: "PB says she's gonna set her vampire sucking machine to full blast if he tries anything funny."
Jake::: "What does full blast even mean?"
Finn::: "I guess it means he'll explode to dust."
Jake::: "Well, what do you want to eat later?"
Princess Bubblegum::: "Hey guys!"
Finn and Jake::: "What?"
Princess Bubblegum::: "Mouth fart code is for emergencies only."
Finn::: "Sorry!"
Peppermint Butler:::Be cool. Be like, 'How's it going, VK? I'm Peppermint B and I know all about you!' No, that sounds lame. 'Yo, V.K., sign my book, jerk!' No...
Princess Bubblegum::: We're home!
Princess Bubblegum:::Is the lab ready?
Peppermint Butler::: Of course. Is he here? 
Vampire King::: Hey.
Peppermint Butler::: AAHHH! SAY SOMETHING; ASK HIM TO SIGN THE BOOK!
Vampire King::: Meh. 
Peppermint Butler::: DO IT, HE'S GETTING AWAY! 
Peppermint Butler:::Wait! Just a sec! Can you sign-
Princess Bubblegum::: Sorry. Too late.
Vampire King::: Hey. Peppermint Butler. I can hear your brains. Look inside your book.
Princess Bubblegum::: Okay, shields down, everybody!
Peppermint Butler::: A psychic autograph! Thank you, your darkness. 
Princess Bubblegum::: Here we go.
Princess Bubblegum:::His vampire essence is now completely drained.Well, let's see what we've got left.
Marceline::: Kitty!
Jake::: Best makeover ever!
Princess Bubblegum::: Hey Pep.
Peppermint Butler::: M'lady?
Princess Bubblegum:::Are you sure your peepers are all right?
Peppermint Butler:::My inner vision is extraordinarily developed. 
Princess Bubblegum:::Okay, great. 'Cause I need you to go to the secret catacombs and bury this nasty bucket of sludge in the deep-deep down.Just be uber-duber careful not to drop it. Pure vampire essence this powerful could kaboom reality off its whack.
Peppermint Butler:::Don't drop the bucket.
Princess Bubblegum:::Exactly.
Peppermint Butler::: Will do.
Jake::: Mm... buckie... 
Peppermint Butler::: Nooooooo!
