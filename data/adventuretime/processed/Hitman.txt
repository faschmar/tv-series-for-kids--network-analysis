Ice King::: Good morning, Breakfast Princesses. 
Breakfast Princess::: Huh?Sis, give me the phone.Oh, hey, Finn. I got another Ice King situation here. Oh, yeah? That would be great! Thanks.
Finn::: Ice King?! How many times have we warned you about using love potion?
Ice King::: That's why I'm using honey.
Jake::: Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways.
Finn:::Yeah, you stink so much I'm gonna ground you for a week!
Ice King::: What? You can't do that!
Finn::: You're grounded for two weeks!
Ice King::: You're grounded for two weeks!
Finn:::Three weeks.
Jake::: Oh, snaps!
Ice King::: Why? I didn't do anything.
Finn::: Four weeks?
Ice King:::Fine. But I'm only gonna do it for a week.
Finn::: That just grounded you for four weeks.
Jake::: Oh, dang!
Ice King:::Okay.What's up with the peace sign?
Jake::: Oh, nah, I'm just trying to show you how many weeks ya got.
Finn::: Get outta here, bubble-butt!
Jake::: Awesome. 
Ice King::: This is so unfair! They're the ones who should be grounded. Not me!I'm so mad! I could just hit them! If only I could hit them without leaving the castle.H...I...T...M...A...N.Ooh! [A profile pops up. It is the Scorcher's profile. It reads:::
Ice King::: Perfect. 
Ice King::: Whoa, you are fast.And quiet.And very good at dramatic silence. I like it.Alright, so, how do we do this? We shake hands or...Oh-ho, paperwork!Finn and Jake.Whoosh!A-ha, there he is. Huh? What's he doing?What the—?! I hired a hitman, not a fireman! 
Jake::: Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right? 
Finn::: Mine's whack. 
Jake::: Well, put some meat in there!
Finn::: Huh. What kind of meat is that?
Jake::: That's Meat Man's meat.
Finn::: Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat?
Jake::: I don't know. I can't read his mind.
Jake:::No!
Ice King::: You guys, I—
Finn::: What do you think "grounded" means?!
Jake::: It's wasted, man.
Finn::: Oh, great. Now see what you did to my buddy? So help me, Ice King.
Ice King::: Okay, okay. Goll. 
Finn::: It's alright, buddy. We can make another. 
Ice King::: Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got some weird ideas about hitting.
Ice King::: Hey, there you are! What's that? I already signed that.I thought I told you to hit them, not burn them alive! You big dummy! Goll! It's almost like you want to kill them! Lucky for them, I stopped the fire!You know what happens when you're burned alive?! Your eyeballs explode! Bleh!Hey wha—?
Finn:::Punch, punch, punch!
Jake:::Rainicorn, don't eat 'im. 
Ice King::: Ice wind! Blow! Blow! Blow!
Jake:::Meat Man. Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man, I didn't mean it, man. 
Ice King::: Finn and Jake, I am just a dream. I was never here...
Ice King::: Okay, mister, you are really trying my patience. How clear can I be?! All I want you to do is hit them. On the shoulder or something.Are you even listening? Oh, I get it.Here's double the grease to not kill Finn and Jake.You trying to hustle me, Scorcher? Okay, I'll play this game. How about this prized piece for your pad?No! Okay, how about these bad boys? Night-vision x-ray goggles. For when you have a lady house-guest.Oh, come on!At least renegotiate the target! You can destroy my least favorite princesses.What about Lumpy Space Princess?Ghost Princess?I can't even hold her with my love mitts.Aw, geez! Uh...Oh! A—A leg cramp! In my leg! Ow, ow, ow.Oh, this is so embarrassing. I'll be right back!Ow, ow, ow!Huh. Think, baby, come on. Ah!Alright, let's hit the hitman, right? There's gotta be a—Ah! [A profile for 'Blastronaut' comes up. It reads:::
Ice King::: Blastronaut. #1 solution for all Hitman problems. Sheesh, 99.95? That's nuts.Scorcher. 
Ice King::: Sweet!
Ice King::: No! Come back, you wussy!Ooh, that was weird.Was that your friend, or something?Look, a super model! Look, a hover-board! Look, the apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boing-loins! Hit in the boing-loins!Boing-loins! Boing-loins. Somebody got hit in them.Peace out! 
Ice King::: Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt!
Jake::: Hey, Finn, you awake yet?
Finn:::I'm trying.
Jake::: I had a dream about Meat Man.
Finn::: Oh, yeah?
Jake::: I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man. 
Finn::: You're grounded!
Ice King::: I know, but shush!
Ice King::: Okay, I hired a guy to kill you by accident.
Finn and Jake::: What?!
Ice King::: I thought he was going to just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch.Well, I froze him in ice, but I think he's free now 'cause he's made out of fire. Or he commands fire, maybe?
Jake::: Good job. Good job, the Ice King.
Finn::: Oh, my life!
Jake::: C'mon, man, let's get outta here!
Finn::: Jake, do something. He's getting close!
Ice King::: You alive?
Jake::: Uh, I think so.
Ice King::: Whew! That was close.
Jake::: Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long.
Finn::: What do we do?
Ice King:::Ooh, got it! I'm gonna kill you guys!
Jake::: Hey, I'll kill you!
Ice King::: No, wait a minute, you two. I won't actually kill you. I'm just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead. And after we fool that fool outside, I'll warm you up, good as new.
Jake::: No way, man!You already messed up enough stuff. You're probably gonna kill us, too.
Finn::: Yeah, we don't trust you!
Ice King::: You'll thank me later.
Ice King:::Stop! Time out! You don't need to do this anymore! Look! They're dead! I killed them myself!Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead! They're dead. No pulses.
Ice King::: So, uh, looks like, you can go home now.
Ice King::: Oh, yes, of course.There. [The Scorcher burns the contract and disappears in a black vapor. He leaves a paper that reads:::
Ice King::: Oh, glad all that's over.Hey, guys, guess what? You're grounded. Underneath my butt!
