Sandy:::See-Thru Princess!The Sun has set!
Sir Soda:::Quit stalling!
Limeston:::Begin the retelling!
See-Thru Princess::: Uh, right.
Glassboy:::Wait, wait! Hold on you guys! Sorry I'm late princess. I was-
Glass People::: Reading.
Glass Person #1:::Book lovin' Glassboy.
Glass Person #2:::Bibliophile.
Glass Person #3:::Doesn't everything you read just leak outta ya?
Glass Person #2:::That was a good one.
See-Thru Princess::: Okay, lights!
See-Thru Princess::: Back in the old days, the wasteland desert was struck with a bolt of magic lightning.
Glass Person:::Kra-kow!
See-Thru Princess::: And thus was born our glorious Glass Kingdom. And, for hundreds of years, things were cool. Until from deep within the ancient furnace rose the dragon Molto Larvo!
Glass People::: Woah!
See-Thru Princess::: Larvo's fire gunked up our entire kingdom. It was real bad times all 'round.But the Lightning Lord above saw our trouble and sent usa hero.
Glassboy::: Ahhh! Marceline!
See-Thru Princess:::Yes. Brave St. Marceline came our aid. With her silver shovel and a holy song, she cast Larvo back into the depths of the pit!
See-Thru Princess::: And once a year, we gather to sing her holy song to keep the monster locked up in the furnace.
Glassboy::: But... what if Marceline slayed Larvo? He hasn't been seen since that day. We don't have to be afraid of the furnace anymore!
Glassboy::: I read about it in this ancient book. The furnace used to fix people! Broken people... like me.
Sandy::: Don't kid yourself, crackface.
See-Thru Princess::: I like the way you are.
Glass Person #1:::Yeah, you have a great personality!
See-Thru Princess:::He does.
Sandy::: Choirmaster! Make the children sing!
Glass children:::So mad at the coconut. I'm sick of living in the ocean.So mad at the coconut.I don't really care about the stomping on the coconut.Â I don't really care about the stomping on the coconut.
Glassboy::: Aw yeah, the pit!
Glassboy::: Huh! It's working! My life is turnin' around.
Glassboy:::Oh, hi Larvo! I'm just gonna fix my crack and get... crackin'! 
Glassboy::: 
Glassboy::: The key! Crack!
Glassboy:::So mad at the coconut-
Glassboy::: Crack!Crack crack crack crack crack crack! Crack crack crack crack crack crack - oof! 
Sir Soda::: Gotcha, key thief!
Sir Soda, Sandy, Limeston:::Glassboy?
Limeston::: What have you done!
Glassboy::: I just wanted to fix myself!
Limeston::: Your hideous face has angered the creature!
See-Thru Princess::: Hey! I'm sure he didn't mean-
Sandy:::No singing in the world can stop the horrors to come now!
Glassboy::: No, I can fix it! I'll find Marceline!
Sandy::: Marceline lived a hecka long time ago!
Sir Soda::: And you're going to the jail tower for this!
See-Thru Princess::: What?
Glassboy::: I know she's out there! She's probably slaying a dragon right now!
Marceline:::Rahhh!
Marceline::: 
Princess Bubblegum::: Ugh! No! Yuck!
Princess Bubblegum::: Thanks, you goof.
Princess Bubblegum::: How's the song coming along?
Marceline::: It's pretty whatever, I don't know.
Princess Bubblegum:::I rarely see you this focused.
Marceline::: Thanks Peebs. Wait, was that a diss?
Princess Bubblegum::: No, no! It's admirable. You're so "in the zone".
Marceline:::I guess I have been going for a new sound this time. I really wanna get it right.
Princess Bubblegum::: Can I hear it?
Marceline::: Uh... alright.
Marceline:::Okay! Nope, no! It's not done yet.
Princess Bubblegum::: Hey, it's alright. I can't wait to hear it when it's ready.
Sandy:::I can't believe it. Why would you release Glassboy?
See-Thru Princess::: We need St. Marceline. Glassboy knows more about her than anyone!
Sir Soda::: Glassboy is a fool!
Sandy::: He'll take one step outside and get his gross crack stuck in his own foot.
Sir Soda::: He would!
Sandy::: I know, that's why I said it!
See-Thru Princess::: I just - it's my right, you know.
Limeston::: Perhaps you should step down.
See-Thru Princess::: No! He'll find Marceline!
Sir Soda::: Okay, but he's probably already dead.
See-Thru Princess::: Hmph!
Sir Soda::: Princess!
Limeston::: Princess?
Sandy::: Wait! We have more excellent advice!
Glassassins:::Marceline...
Glassboy::: Huh?Who are you?
Choose Goose::: Good Evening! And how you been? Are you the chump with dry skin?
Glassboy::: No.I'm looking for Marceline.
Choose Goose::: Oh, quack! a boy with a head crack! 
Glassboy::: Hey!
Choose Goose::: Marceline, Marceline. The Vampire Queen! Through the candy you must go to the place where grass doth grow. 
Glassboy::: Thank you, strange duck. Bye! 
Choose Goose::: How lucky for me that oblivious is he. The boy is none the wiser of my cart of illegal moisturizer!
Simon::: This is going out to a little girl named Marceline.Marceline...
Glassboy::: Marceline!
Glassboy::: Hey, old guy!You know Marceline?
Smudge::: Hey! Time for you to leave.
Glassboy::: Old guy, please!
Simon:::...but it's making me crazy.Oh! 
Smudge:::Oomph!
Glassboy::: Ugh!
Simon:::So...big Marcy fan, huh?
Marceline::: Simon!
Simon::: Hi, gang. I was just playing out at Dirt Beer Guy's tavern......then this guy showed up. 
Glassboy:::Ahhh! St. Marceline! 
Simon:::I'm... just gonna use your um... facilities.
Princess Bubblegum::: Sooo... you know about Marcy then?
Glassboy::: Do I! Half vampire, half demon, half god!
Marceline::: Nice.
Glassboy::: She single-handedly bested the horrible dragon Larvo!
Marceline::: Larvo?
Glassboy::: The dragon has returned! The Glass Kingdom needs you again dude.
Previous STP::: She did it! Marceline, you won!
Younger Princess Bubblegum:::Seriously?
Younger Princess Bubblegum::: Fine. We're done.
Marceline::: Uh... I don't know...
Princess Bubblegum::: Yeah, we're sorry about your kingdom, kid. But we know other heroes who could help-
Glassboy:::Pleeeeease!
Simon::: Ahhh, ahhh! What! This is how I cope!
Simon::: Please don't! I'm too old to die!
Simon:::You're after Marceline? Too bad, goopy! She already left!
Elise:::Now, next to the family of bugs draw... a silver tree.
Elise::: Perfect.
Young Marceline::: Now What?
Elise::: Hm...above that tree... draw... a panda with a hat.
Young Marceline::: That's silly. I want to draw a walrus in an overcoat.
Elise:::No, no. The panda is very important.
Young Marceline::: Okay, mommy.
Elise::: Give him a hat. A biiig pointy hat.
Elise::: You're gonna be a great artist when you grow up, Marceline.
Young Marceline:::Yeah, I know.
Marceline::: Hey, why are we going this way?
Princess Bubblegum::: Because it's the fastest route. Why do you ask?
Marceline::: Nothing. It's just... I used to live around here...
Princess Bubblegum::: What, really? When was this?
Marceline::: I don't really wanna talk about it.
Princess Bubblegum:::Ooooo, so mysterious all the time. Just like your song.How ya doin' back there Glassboy?
Princess Bubblegum::: This is all gonna go great.
Princess Bubblegum::: Wow! It's just as beautiful as I remember it!
Princess Bubblegum::: The great ceremonial glass doorbell!
Princess Bubblegum::: I love ceremony.First, approach the bell quietly and give it a single strike.
Princess Bubblegum::: And now for the best part- the welcome bowl!
Princess Bubblegum::: Mmm, sand!
Glassboy:::I was thinking if we have some time left over after you defeat the dragon then maybe- 
Marceline:::Hey, Peebs. Can we get this over with?
Shard::: No visitors! We're in a state of emergency.
Princess Bubblegum:::Yes, and we're here to help-
Shard::: Do you have a royal invitation?
Princess Bubblegum::: Well, not officially, but-
Shard::: No invite, no entry. Get lost Pinky!
Marceline::: Okay, that's it.
Princess Bubblegum:::Actually, someone probably remembers me.
Shard::: Grrr! The great bell! Vandals!When the other shards get here, they're gonnachiiipyooouuu uuup!
Marceline:::Where's the dragon?
Princess Bubblegum:::Be cool. I'll handle this with diplomacy.
Princess Bubblegum::: Apologies for the unorthodox entrance, glass citizens.
Sir Soda::: Surround them now!
Princess Bubblegum::: Uh-oh
Sandy::: Filthy opaque intruders!
See-Thru Princess:::Glassboy!
Sandy:::Wait, I was being haughty!
Princess Bubblegum::: It's wonderful to formally meet youYour... Majesty.
Glassboy::: STP!
See-Thru Princess::: I'm so happy to see you alive.
Sandy::: Well we're not. Glassboy snuck a pair of trash-water harpies into our perceft civ- into our perfect civilization. Shards! Take him back to the tower, you guys.
Glassboy::: It's Marceline! The real Marceline!
Sandy:::Bah! This could be any run-of-the-mill cave hag. Why should we believe you even?
Glassassins:::Marceline...
Marceline::: What?
Princess Bubblegum:::Marcy!
Princess Bubblegum:::Heh heh. They're jellybeans. It's not gross.
Marceline::: Alright whoever you are.Let's play.
Marceline::: Dang.
Marceline::: Hey!Get back here!Grrr! Why ya hidin', bro?
Marceline::: 
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh no!
Glassboy::: St. Marceline!
Glassassins::: 
Princess Bubblegum::: Sound waves?Hey Marceline! Turn up the reverb!
Glassassins::: 
Larvo::: 
Princess Bubblegum:::Phew.
Glass People:::Marceline! Marceline!
Marceline::: Bleh-heh-heh-heh! 
Glassboy::: Oh yeah!
See-Thru Princess:::Oh my gosh, she is so dope.
Glass People:::Marceline! Marceline
Marceline:::By the way, I consider "cave hag" a compliment.
Glass people::: Ooooo!
Sandy::: Hmph!
Marceline::: Next up,taking care of that dragon.
Glassboy::: Oh yeeeah!Redemption for Glassboy!
Glass Person:::Cleansing spray?
Marceline::: Bleh!
Princess Bubblegum::: Ah, you got sprayed. That's a pretty high honor.
Marceline::: Woah, wait.Did you wanna be sprayed too?
Princess Bubblegum:::No, no! I'm happy everyone's treating you so well! I'm just...it's like I'm nothing to them.
Marceline:::Hey. You're everything to me, okay?
Larvo::: 
Glass Children:::So mad at the coconut.I'm sick of living in the ocean.
See-Thru Princess:::How long will it take you to write a new incantation?
Marceline::: Incantation?
See-Thru Princess::: The dragon's grown too powerful to be repelled by your original holy song!
Glass Children:::So mad at the coconut.I'm sick of living in the ocean.
Marceline::: Dudes, your ceremony isn't working because you've been donking up the lyrics.Listen up, y'all!
Marceline:::Um, Peebs? Are you gonna be okay hearing this again?
Princess Bubblegum:::Do what you have to do Marceline.
Princess Bubblegum:::I guess you've still got it.
Marceline:::Listen Bonnie... you know all that stuff I said-
Glassboy:::Oh, I get it now. That song's about her,isn't it?
Sandy::: Of course, it's not even subtleee.
Marceline::: 
Glass people::: 
Marceline:::Why didnât it work?
Princess Bubblegum::: Itâs been like a million years since that song worked. Mind if I try?
Marceline::: What?
Princess Bubblegum::: Screeeee!
The Morrow::: 
Larvo::: 
Marceline::: The Morrow was following us with that the whole time? Peebs, were youâ¦ expecting me to fail?
Princess Bubblegum:::We never did figure out why your song worked in the first place. My next-gen barrier will buy me time to figure out Larvoâs true weakness.
Sir Soda:::Your outsiderâs song just made the dragon angrier and sassier.
Limeston::: Whatâs your plan now?
See-Thru Princess:::Alright, umâ¦
Glassboy::: Marceline can do it. Tell them, Princess! Princess! Tell them!
See-Thru Princess:::Put a cork in it, Glassboy! Please! Just get out of my face for five seconds!
Princess Bubblegum::: Ah! I got this, I got this, I got this.
Marceline::: No. It has to be me. Iâll write a new, angrier song!The other day, you used my brush. It was okay. Iâ¦ didnâtâ¦ mind.Ughhh. Iâm just not that angry young punk anymore! Itâs like I donât even remember what itâs like to be hurt, and sad.
Princess Bubblegum::: Mhm.
Marceline::: No. Itâs still in me somewhere. I just have to go find it. 
Princess Bubblegum:::âGoâ?
Marceline:::I have to go back. Back to the place where I was hurt the most. 
Princess Bubblegum::: Marcy, this is a bad idea!
Young Marceline:::Thatâs it! Thatâs the hat panda! Look, mom!
Elise::: Youâre a regular cartographer, Marcy.Weâll be at the secret clubhouse party in no time.
Young Marceline::: Mom, will they have food there?
Elise::: Every party has food.All the good parties anyway
Elise::: Hey, letâs play a game. I seeâ¦ something that starts with an âS."
Young Marceline::: Huh.Is it that scorpion?
Elise:::No.
Marceline:::Is it that skeleton under the scorpion?
Marceline::: Maybe we should play something el- 
Marceline:::Ooh!I see something that starts with a âPâ!Puppy!This puppyâs funny-looking.
Puppy::: Whazzup?
Puppy::: Wâzup!
Elise::: Woah mama.
Young Marceline::: Bad doggy!
Elise::: Marceline!
Young Marceline:::Mommy?Why are you looking at me like that?
Puppy:::Whazzap? 
Larvo::: 
See-Thru Princess::: 
Princess Bubblegum::: Huah! 
See-Thru Princess::: Youâre so competent!
Princess Bubblegum::: Yeah, Iâm a pretty good stabber.
Princess Bubblegum:::Thanks for volunteering.
Glass Citizen::: The giant baster seems excessive.
Princess Bubblegum::: Check, check.
Sandy:::Is this what passes for music in Cotton Candy Land or whatever?
Glass Citizen::: Whatâs this now?
See-Thru Princess:::Look out!
Sandy:::Gah! Youâve gone warped, Princess. First Glassboy, then that fakey Marceline. Now youâre putting faith in a princess even more helpless than you, okay.
Sir Soda::: So either grow up or step aside!
Younger Princess Bubblegum:::Oh geez, oh geez, oh geez, ahhh geez.Donât worry, good people! Iâve got this under control!Just need a sec.
Younger Marceline::: Yo, Peebs. Listen to this. 
Younger Princess Bubblegum:::Why are you acting like this?
Younger Marceline::: Oh, come on. You love it.
Younger Princess Bubblegum::: Theyâll all be killed if I donât figure out how to defeat the dragon!
Younger Marceline::: Theyâre made of glass. They break. Who cares?
Younger Princess Bubblegum::: I do. They need me.
Younger Marceline:::Uh-huh
Ancient Glass Person #1:::Ah!
Ancient Glass Person #2:::Ah!
Ancient Glass Person #3:::Ah, that hurts!
Younger Princess Bubblegum:::Stop it.I donât have time for you right now.
Younger Marceline::: Ugh! Why are you being such a bummer?
Younger Princess Bubblegum:::Could you just get out of my face for five seconds, you jerk!
Younger Marceline:::If you didnât want me here, then why did you ask me?
Younger Princess Bubblegum:::I didnât! They called for me and you tagged along.Go home.I honestly canât focus with you here acting like monster trash.
Marceline:::Wellâ¦ as long as weâre beingreally honestâ¦ 
Young Marceline::: 
Elise:::Come on. Come on, come on!
Young Marceline::: Mom? Am Iâ¦ a scary monster?
Elise::: Marcy, come here.
Elise::: 
Young Marceline::: Mommy!
Elise:::Hey, sweetie. Iâm gonna fix this motorcycle up for us, but itâs gonna take awhile.Hereâs a special VIP card to get into the secret clubhouse. 
Young Marceline::: What?
Elise:::Youâreâ¦ youâre gonna be late for the party.Follow the map.
Young Marceline::: But I wanna stay with you!
Elise::: Marceline! I donât have time for you right now!
Young Marceline:::Secret clubhouse!Boop!Hello?I see you. Party! 
Princess Bubblegum::: Iâve figured out a way to stop Larvo for good. Itâll be risky.
See-Thru Princess::: Risky? Iâm on thin ice as it is.
Sir Soda::: I wish I could read lips.
Princess Bubblegum::: Youâre a princess.
See-Thru Princess::: Yeah.
Princess Bubblegum::: Which means protecting your people no matter what. Even when your vampire girlfriend bails on you.
See-Thru Princess::: Oo.
Princess Bubblegum::: We need a system to convey a butt-ton of liquid, but I donât have the resources here.
See-Thru Princess:::My people can help!
Glass People:::Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
See-Thru Princess::: I have a plan to defeat Larvo.
Princess Bubblegum::: Based on my research! Â  Â  Â 
See-Thru Princess::: And itâs going to require all of us.
Sir Soda:::Whatâs with the touchy-feely inspirational jazz?
See-Thru Princess::: Can it! Iâm over you thimble heads always chipping my cups!This is a crisis, and I intend to lead with transparency.
Princess Bubblegum:::Role-model! Right here!
Young Marceline::: Hm.
Young Marceline::: Whadaya think, Lemmy?That was great!Yeah. Youâre so good at music, Marceline!Why is your mom scared of you? Where is she?She saw what I did to the mean dog. Then she found a scooter, andâ¦And that was her ticket outta town.You scare everybody away, Marceline. Just like your dad.Hey, Marcy did that on purpose! Like a funny joke.Yeah, thatâs right. When people get scared and run away, itâs because I want them to! 
Marceline:::Whatâs up, Lemmy?Hey dude.
Marceline:::This thing always got on my nerves. 
Machine::: One new message.
Elise:::Marcelineâ¦ youâre there arenât you?Brave girl. Iâm sorry I had to trick you.But youâre tough enough to handle this world on your own.And itâs not gonna change you becauseâ¦ you have a good heartI love you, Marceline. I hope you can forgive me. 
Machine::: End of messages. 
Marceline:::Ugh. Momâ¦
Marceline:::Mom?
Glassboy:::Itâs me, Glassboy!Haha! I heard something weird so I came in.
Marceline::: I wanna bealone right now! 
Glassboy::: Please donât send me away. I-Iâm just like you!
Marceline:::You donât say.
Glassboy::: I thought I was sad that See-Thru Princess turned on me,but now I know it was justpunk-rock anger. 
Marceline:::Is that really what I sound like? Oh, what am I doing?
Glassboy::: Huh? Weâre here to reconnect with yourpunk-rock anger!
Marceline::: Nah, I need to be with Bubblegum.Sheâs good for me. Itâs not her fault Iâve got baggage.
Glassboy::: Oh. Wellâ¦When we get back, maybe I can show you all my fav manga.
Reformed Glassassin:::Canâtâ¦ runâ¦ 
Marceline:::My bass.My bass!
Princess Bubblegum::: Ready?
See-Thru Princess::: Hm!
See-Thru Princess::: Here it comes.
See-Thru Princess:::He got really big.
Princess Bubblegum:::Down here Larvo!
See-Thru Princess::: Now!
Glass People::: 
Princess Bubblegum::: I did it!All that root beer came from my body!
Glass People::: 
Larvo::: 
Glassassin::: 
Marceline:::Any other day, I would totally annihilate you for wrecking my stuff.
Marceline:::But Bonnie is more important.
Glassboy::: Haha! Eat it!
Glass Lady::: Ahhh! The molten one!
Larvo::: 
Glass Person::: Caution! Broken glass!
Sandy::: Itâs just as we predicted.
Limeston::: Itâs going to destroy us all!
Sir Soda::: Câmon!Nowâs our chance to act!
Sir Soda::: Run, run, run!
Sandy::: Okay, you got a head start.
Marceline::: Oh no, Iâm too late!
Princess Bubblegum::: Run to the bridge!Â Egress! Egress!
Marceline::: Bonnie!
Princess Bubblegum:::Marceline!
See-Thru Princess::: Glassboy!
Glassboy::: Princess.
Princess Bubblegum::: Quick, get out your bass and start singing.
Marceline::: My bass is smashed.
Princess Bubblegum::: Ah! You loved that bass! Well, ummmâ¦ then your new song must be extra angry and sad.
Marceline:::No, it feels more likeâ¦a wave of acceptance has washed over me
Princess Bubblegum:::Nooooo!
Glassboy::: Hey, I wrote a hateful song!See-Thru, I see right through-
Marceline::: Look out!
Glassboy::: This thing really hates me!âScuse me. 
See-Thru Princess::: Woo!
Glassboy::: Itâs me you want!Leave my princess alone!
Larvo::: 
Glassboy::: 
Sandy::: This is the last place the beast will-Huh?
Glassboy:::I didnât think this through!
See-Thru Princess:::Glassboy!
Sandy::: Yeah! Get in that death hole!So what now?
Limeston::: The forcefield! Weâll crank it all the way up!
Sandy::: Yes!We can trap them both in there forever!
PB:::Ah! Someone turned my forcefield on full blast!
Sandy:::Uh, I think someone broke this.
Sir Soda::: Bail?
Marceline:::PB?
Larvo::: 
Marceline:::Is he breathing?
Princess Bubblegum::: No. But thatâs okay. I donât think he breathes.Weâve gotta find a way out of here.
Princess Bubblegum::: Ah! Stop! The forcefield has destabilized the entire chamber.
Princess Bubblegum::: Why did I even create a âfull blastâ setting.Live and learn.
Marceline::: Hm.This is pretty bad, huh?
Princess Bubblegum::: Yeah, pretty bad. 
Marceline::: Probably shouldâve tried singing anyway. 
Princess Bubblegum:::I was sorta hoping your song wouldnât work. So I could finally show the Glass Kingdom how much of a scientific genius I am.
Marceline:::Well, mission accomplished?
Princess Bubblegum::: 
Marceline::: Iâm so sorry I left you alone on this. Itâs justâ¦ being back here, where all this bad stuff happenedâ¦My mom and I didnât talk about bad stuff. When she got really sick, she didnât even tell me. She meant well, butâ¦ I think it messed me up about being honest about my feelings. You and me are in a good place now.Well, not right now, obviouslyâ¦
Princess Bubblegum::: 
Marceline::: You know, if this really is the endâ¦ I have something I want to sing to you. 
Marceline::: Oh!
Princess Bubblegum:::Marceli-Oh, glob!
Princess Bubblegum:::I love you, okay?
Marceline:::At least theyâll find our skeletons entwined forever.
Princess Bubblegum::: I donât have a skeleton, but thatâs pretty romantic.
Marceline::: Stay back!
Inner Larvo::: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!
Marceline::: Look, itâs got a mushy center!Just like me.
Princess Bubblegum::: Yeah! We can totally kill it now!
Marceline:::Peebs, no.
Glassboy::: Woooah. Also, ew, but mostly awww.
Sandy:::Shutting down the barrier? Um, itâs not advisable,Majestyyy
See-Thru Princess::: Shut your blowholes!You trapped my best friend in there to die. Shame!
Sir Soda:::Yo, my knife
Inner Larvo::: La, la, la, la, laaa! La, la, la, la, laaa!
Glassassin::: Huh?
Inner Larvo::: La, la, la, la, la, laaa!
Glassassin::: Awww! 
Glass Man:::This is going to cost million to reglaze. Â  Â 
See-Thru Princess:::Glassboy.
Glassboy::: 
Glassboy::: My Princess! Youâre- youâreâ¦
Glass Man::: Highness, are you alright?
Sandy:::What a tragic turn. I am so sad to tell you that your reign is over.
Sir Soda::: On account of that nasty crack.
See-Thru Princess::: No Way.
Glass Man:::She got pants now.
See-Thru Princess::: We were taught that cracks make us less, but one brave boy showed me the truth.Thatâs you, Glassboy.
Glassboy:::Me!
See-Thru Princess:::You donât need to hide that crackâ¦ever.
See-Thru Princess::: All of you? Why were you hiding them?
Purple Glass Man::: I was afraid people would judge meâ¦ the way I judge them.
Blue Glass Person:::Me too.
Sandy:::Â  No, no, no! Everyone, stop taking your clothes off!
Sir Soda::: Hey Sandy, whatâs this? 
Sandy::: Itâs nothing! 
Limston:::You have one too!
Sir Soda::: Frosty jerk!
See-Thru Princess:::Sorry I ever doubted you.
Glass Man::: Yeah, sorry for bullying you your whole life.
Simon::: Marceline, youâre in grave danger! But donât worry! I brought help!
Banana Guard::: Hooah!
Banana Guards::: Wee-woo, wee-woo, wee-woo, wee-woo! 
Finn::: Hey, PB. Yâall got monster troubs?
See-Thru Princess::: PB, are these friends of yours?
Banana Guard::: Have at you! 
Marceline::: Ah! Come on. 
Princess Bubblegum::: Yep. These are my people.And Iâm really proud of them.
See-Thru Princess::: That manâs towel just blew off. 
Finn::: My bad
Princess Bubblegum:::Eh.
See-Thru Princess::: Shards?
Princess Bubblegum:::I must look a real mess.
Marceline::: Nuh-uh. You always look great after fighting a monster.
Princess Bubblegum::: You think so?This is nice. We never get to dance. Youâre always the one performing.
Marceline::: I have a lot more songs I wanna sing. Reeeal sappy ones.
Princess Bubblegum::: Good. Iâve always loved your songs
