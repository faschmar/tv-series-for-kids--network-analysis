Finn:::Huh?
Jake:::I was just sipping my coffee.
Finn:::Oh. 
BMO:::I am also excited about today.
Jake:::Oh, yeah?
BMO:::Today is the first day of my new job.
Finn:::What's your new job, BMO?
Jake:::Yeah, are you a spy? You know, 'cause of the overcoat?
BMO:::I'm a door-to-door salesman.
Finn and Jake::: Oh.
Jake:::What are you selling?
BMO:::I've got so many great things. Like for the man about town, this piece of lint.
Jake:::I'll take it! 
BMO:::Hooray, my first sale! That'll be four doubloons.
Jake:::Can I pay you later?
BMO:::Mm, the customer is always right!
Jake:::Good attitude, BMO.
BMO:::Well, gentlemen... got to chop that wood.
Finn::: It's Ice King.
Jake::: I know.
Ice King::: Oh! 
BMO::: Okay, wish me luck, fellas, even though I don't need-
Finn and Jake::: Aww.
Ice King:::Boy, this is great, huh? You and me out in the fresh air? Now, the key to being a tip-top salesman is to get the ol' foot in the door.
BMO:::Bodies don't talk, Ice King.
Ice King:::Well, mine does.
BMO:::Okay, then. If I say "My feet hurt," you can go "Woof woof." That's my dogs barking.
Ice King:::BMO, I think we're gonna make an unbeatable team.
BMO:::Yeah, yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! 
Tree Trunks::: "Chapter 3::: No Time For Sleeping. Elizabeth's heart was racing like a water mill after spring thaw. She knew her enemies were coming for her, but when? Suddenly, there was a knock at the door."
Tree Trunks:::Oh! Oh. Oh, my goodness. Someone's at the door. That's all.Hello.
BMO:::Tree Trunks, how are your children? Can you believe this weather? 
Tree Trunks:::So polite. Please, please come in.
BMO::: You have a lovely home.
Tree Trunks:::Here, have some apple pie.
BMO:::Oh, thank you.
Tree Trunks:::Now what can I do for you?
BMO:::Oh, well, I'd like to show you what I'm selling today.
BMO:::Okay, we have a broken branch, a half-eaten sandwich - oh, another ball of lint.
Tree Trunks:::Another?
BMO:::These are selling like red hots. A dust bunny - That's like a cage-free ball of lint. A doll's head, and a little velvet bag, tied tight at the top.
Tree Trunks:::I'll take the branch. My loose cash is up there in the flower jar. Help yourself.
BMO::: You have a lovely home! 
Mr. Pig::: What'd you buy, honey bunch?
Tree Trunks:::A branch.
Mr. Pig:::Huh.Huh? Oh. Ah, Tree Trunks, you're a financial genius.
BMO::: I can't believe we unloaded that branch. It wasn't even our best one. Oh, my. Shield my eyes from the sun.
Ice King:::Why?
BMO:::Because I think I see our next customer.Those nuts could be ours. Excuse me, little boy!
BMO:::How are your children?! Ice King, duck. Jump. Right. Right again.Left. Jump, jump. Left. Right. Left. Ice King, you're doing so good. You have not bumped into anything.
Ice King:::BMO, where's the customer?
BMO:::Oh, no. I was so excited about you not bumping into anything, I lost the customer. Ice King, I think we are lost.
BMO:::Look. A house.
Ice King:::All I see is the inside of this coat.
BMO:::And... stop. Knock politely.
BMO:::Mysterious sentinel, you have a lovely home.Turn.How are your children? 
BMO:::Hello.
BMO:::I'm a door-to-door salesman, ma'am.
BMO::: Oh, excuse my indigestion. 
Ice King:::Ouch.
BMO:::I have some wonderful new products, like, uh, this ball of lint. No, wait, this is the dust bunny. Uh... Oh, oh! I know - this velvet bag.
BMO:::Did I mention that it contains Finn's teeth?
Gumbald:::Please, let's go in the parlor, where we can be more comfortable.
Gumbald:::And you're sure these are Finn's teeth?
BMO:::Yes.
Gumbald:::The same Finn who serves Princess Bubblegum, obstructs my plans, and plagues my thoughts?
BMO:::Yes.
Gumbald:::Finn the Human's teeth?
BMO:::That's a BMO guarantee.
Ice King::: Psst! Does Finn know you have his teeth? Because I don't think-
BMO::: Hey! I'm trying to close a sale here.
Gumbald:::I hope you accept silver. I can pay you immediately.Yes, my pretties.
Jake:::Poor little guy. Still wearing out the shoe leather trying to make just one more lousy sale before coming home.
Finn:::He'll feel better after we have a little party for him.
Jake:::Still, it's tough seeing your kid get his heart set on doing something he really sucks at.
BMO:::Hello, boys. Meet the salesman of the year. Or maybe of the decade. The Chinese food is on me. I mean, check out the loot. 
Finn::: It's real.
Jake:::What the heck did you sell to get this silver goblet?
BMO:::Just a line of smooth talk and pipe dreams. Oh, and a set of human baby teeth.
Finn:::Where did you even get a set of human baby teeth?Human baby teeth!!BMO!
BMO:::Branches and lint are moving like cray, Jake.
BMO:::Oh, sure, I sold your baby teeth. I could sell any part of you.
Finn:::These were, like, the only things I had left from when I was a little kid.
Jake:::Hey, you know what? We'll just go buy back those little pearly whites. I'm sure whoever bought them is like, "Why did I buy these things?" What possible use could some guy have for a set of human baby teeth? Unless he's an evil sorcerer or a mad scientist... He wasn't a mad scientist, was he?
BMO:::Well...
Finn::: Stay back, baby Finns. 
Finn:::They're made out of some kind of hard tooth-like material. Ouch. Ouch! Ice King, freeze these nightmare babies.
Ice King:::I'm not allowed to wear my crown. It's against BMO's dress code.
Jake:::Just don't let them climb into your mouth!
Jake:::Hey, there, bitey boys. Get off of there.Where's your baby manners? Eek.
BMO:::Hmm. Maybe I sold too well.
Ice King:::Hey, you're a great salesman. Evil babies are not a problem for you. They're an opportunity.
BMO:::Yeah. Where did I put those - Oh, here they are.Gentlemen, could I interest you in a couple of sledgehammers? Perfect for smashing through minerals or composites.
Finn::: I'll take one.
Jake:::Me too!
BMO:::Great decision.
BMO:::A little tap is all it takes.
Jake::: These baby-smashing hammers are great.
BMO:::I'm sorry I caused such a mess. It's very bad for business.
Ice King:::Well, time to call it a day.The ice man leaveth.
BMO:::Hey, wait. See you tomorrow, partner. 
Ice King:::Until tomorrow.
Finn:::Yeah, you're not doing this tomorrow.
Gumbald:::Hmm. In retrospect, the attack would have worked much better were they not baby teeth.
