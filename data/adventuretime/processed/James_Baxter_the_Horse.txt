Finn::: Yeah!
Finn::: Finn the Human!
Jake::: Jake!
Finn::: Finn!
Jake::: Jake!
Jake::: Sheesh, tough crowd.
Finn::: I think we should find an easier person to cheer up. It was a mistake to visit a funeral.
Green Lollipop Girl:::Eh, what do you want?! Please, I'm just a very sad girl!
Finn:::That is so perfect! 
Jake:::Yeah, man, so unique!
James Baxter:::James Baxter! James Baxter!
Finn:::Man, what's he doing that we're not? We just gotta figure that out.
Jake:::No, it's like, he's shredding on a guitar and learning how to shred isn't just copying the exact notes as someone else's solo. You need to learn how to do your own solo. 
BMO:::Why am I recording?
Finn:::You're documenting our creative flow in case we make a breakthrough.
Jake:::Dude, I think we do got something.
Finn:::Let's check the video.

BMO:::Yeah, that sounds makes me feel happy!
Finn:::Good, good, happy is what we want.

Finn:::Check our data?
Finn:::Maybe it should be higher?
Jake:::Yeah, maybe, maybe it could be lower, I don't know.
Finn::: Let's both agree that that sound belongs there. 
Jake:::See that sound? I drew that sound connected to two other sounds. 
Finn:::Hmm, something's missing. 
Jake:::That's it, the missing thing in our thing!
Finn:::Yeah, James Baxter don't just got his catch phrase, he has his beach ball bizz! 
Jake:::So we gotta create feel good body actions to go with our feel good sound!
Finn:::We just crushed it, homie.
