Finn:::Ahhh... YEAH!!! 
Jake:::Heh heh.Aw, yeah. 
Finn::: Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls.Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure!
Jake::: Whoa, really?!
Finn::: Yeah, man!!I wrote on my arm this to-do list of cool junk.Number one::: back flip off this bridge and do the splits. Number two: track down and slay a goblin horde. Number three... storm clouds?
Jake:::Hmmm...Finn... it's a knife storm!!It's raining knives, man! Come on! 
Finn::: I've never seen a knife storm before... It's beautiful.
Jake::: Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid.
Finn::: Well, what're we gonna do?
BMO::: Who wants to play video games??
Finn and Jake::: BMO!!
Jake::: What's on the menu, BMO?
BMO::: I've created a new game called Conversation Parade.
Finn::: Hah! Alright!
Jake::: Start it up, BMO!
BMO:::What do you think about the stars in the sky?
Finn::: 'S okay, I guess.
Jake::: Yeah, they're cool.
BMO::: That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn...
Finn::: Booooo.
Jake::: BMO, that was weak.
Finn::: What now?
Jake::: Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!
Finn::: Whoa! What?!
Jake::: Let's use our imaginations, man!
Finn::: Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that.
Jake::: Eh. Your loss.AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!!Lava on the floor!
Finn::: Shut up, man...
Jake::: Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!
Finn::: I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality. 
Jake::: NOOOOO!!
Finn:::AAAAH!!!Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!
Jake::: I was just playin' around with my imagination......and then everything got intense.
Finn::: It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!
Jake:::Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...
Finn::: Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries.
Finn and Jake::: WHOA!
Finn::: But first stop imagining lava!
Jake::: I can't! My imagination's too amazing!
Finn::: Imagine turning your imagination off!
Jake::: I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters.
Finn::: Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?
Jake::: You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!
Finn::: Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!
Jake::: Neat!Grab that missile.
Finn::: Okay.
Jake::: And... get that cosmic gauntlet.
Finn::: Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH!What did I just hit?!
Jake::: I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.
Finn::: Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?
Jake::: Oh, there's one now.Look out!
Finn::: Aah! I can feel it on my foot!I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!
Jake::: You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!
Finn::: Yah, yah! 
Jake::: Alright! You're gettin' him, man!Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family.Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face!She's comin' back for revenge.
Finn::: Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!
Jake::: The knife storm, remember?!?!Oh, boy... Ooh... Finn, I found some candy.It tastes like banana candy, man.Here, man. Try some.
Finn:::Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.
Jake::: Okay!It is done.
Finn:::Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!
Riddle Master::: No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle.
Finn:::An imaginary riddle master?
Finn:::Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test.
Riddle Master::: Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land.
Finn:::LAY IT ON ME!!
Riddle Master::: Yes, um... The riddle, uh... It... cometh... uh...
Jake::: I can't imagine a riddle.
Finn::: Dude, just make it super easy.
Riddle Master::: THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle?
Finn::: Man, that riddle sucks.
Riddle Master::: THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!!
Finn::: YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!
Jake::: You exploded the snakes right at us!!
Finn::: I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!
Jake::: I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!
Finn::: Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!
Jake:::AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!!Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck!The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!
Finn::: Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!
Finn::: Don't you do it...
Finn::: DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!
Bazooka Goblin::: Hee... heehee... hee... Okay.
Jake::: YEAH!
Finn::: AW, YEAH!
Finn::: Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me.
Jake::: Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed.
Finn::: Is it clear?
Jake::: Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you.
Finn::: Oh! I found the shut-off lever!
Jake::: Cool, man!Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby.What're you laughin' at?
Finn::: Alright. I'm gonna turn it off.UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!
Jake::: Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!
Finn::: What?! Well, how do I kill it?! 
Jake::: I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this!Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!
Finn::: Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!!Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake?Hey, come on. Wake up, man.
Jake:::Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy.
Finn::: Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?
Jake::: I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.
Finn::: Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!
Jake::: But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you.
Finn::: Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing. 
Finn::: Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note.
Jake::: One note is all that is needed.
Finn:::I'm gonna turn your imagination back on.Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!
Jake::: True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?
Finn::: I remembereth.
Jake::: I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.
Finn::: No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now......only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go...What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad.Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!
Finn:::Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something.Now for that switch.
Bellamy Bug:::Good morrow, sir! My name is Bellamy Bug! Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy.
Finn::: No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!
Bellamy Bug:::I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!
Finn::: REPRESENT THIS!And this. 
Bellamy::: Oh! I say! Oh! Ah! Ouch! Ah!
Finn::: Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright.I hope this works, Jake!Haha, yeah!Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button! 
Jake:::Aaaah!! I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!
Finn:::Take a hike, fairy! Normal style! 
Jake:::Aw, man... I imagined my mom naked!Yugh!
Finn::: You okay?
Jake::: I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure!
Finn::: I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here...with... lava on the floor!
Jake::: Huh?!AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding. 
Finn::: Hahahaha! Good dog.
