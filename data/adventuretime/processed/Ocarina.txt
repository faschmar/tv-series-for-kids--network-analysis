T.V.:::Ugh. I'm covered in noobs.
Lady Rainicorn:::T.V., 잘 지내니? (How are you?)
T.V.::: I've got hunger cranks.
Viola:::Hmm? Oh, yes. That's veryinteresting.
T.V.:::Kim Kil Whan. 
Kim Kil Whan:::Hm.
T.V.:::Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraahh!Mom, when are we gonna eat?! I'm going nuts!
Lady Rainicorn:::T.V., 말조심해! (Watch your mouth!)
Jake Jr.:::Seriously, Mom, Dad's already three hours late with the food!
Viola:::You hush, Junior. You know Dad's a wonderful cook.
Jake Jr.:::Viola, when's the last time you even heard from Dad?
Viola:::Oh, you know. Dad is... distractible.
Jake Jr.::: "Distractible"!
T.V.:::Yeah, I love Dad and everything, but he's only ever met me twice.
Lady Rainicorn:::Charlie, Viola, T.V., Jake Jr., Kim Kil Whan, 제발! 너네 아빠가 너를 얼마나 보고 싶어하는데. (Please! Your dad really wants to see you.) 
Finn & Jake::: Whoo!
Finn:::Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Jake:::Yeah, yeah, yeah! We're real late! Happy birthday, puppies! Okay, so, putting it out there—I didn't remember to bring you guys any birthday presents, but I did bring lunch!It's macaroni salad.
Viola:::Dad, you're beautiful!
Kim Kil Whan:::Dad! We have new business to discuss.
Jake:::Happy birthday, Kim Kil Whan.
Kim Kil Whan:::Birthdays are old business. 
Jake:::Whoa, neat. Um, well, how are things going, Son?
Kim Kil Whan:::"Things"? "Things" have switched hands.
Jake:::Heh.I get it.
Kim Kil Whan:::Dad, when I say that things have switched hands, I mean to say that things you have previously claimed ownership of have transferred from your hands to my hands, in that...I bought your tree house.
Jake:::What?!
Kim Kil Whan:::What::: the deed to your tree house. How: acquired through legal trade. From whom: the deed's previous owner, Marceline The Vampire Queen...in exchange for one lunatic bass.
Kim Kil Whan:::When::: effective immediately.
Jake:::But, Son, why?
Kim Kil Whan:::We will convene at the property.
Kim Kil Whan::: Sorry I'm late. Okay, so, as the deed-holder of this tree house I am now your landlord.The first thing I'm going to have to do is assess your treasure room. 
Jake::: But son!What would your mother say? Doing this to your poor Pip-Pop!
Kim Kil Whan:::I'm sorry Dad. Deeds don't bleed. 
Jake::: Okay son. Get ready to be glitter-stunned by all this treasu--Oh, yeah. We spent all of it.All we have left are these vintage photos I got at the flea market. They're interesting!
Kim Kil Whan:::Woof.All right.So I guess this is the apartment the two of you can afford. It's a ladder.
Kim Kil Whan::: Yeah? Yeah. Send them on over.Sorry about that.Anyway, as you can see, this beauty offers direct first and second floor access. Superb craftsmanship and etcetera. I suppose you're familiar.Yes, Finn?
Finn:::Yeah, uh, when are we going to get our house back?
Kim Kil Whan::: What?Excuse me.
Kim Kil Whan::: Good afternoon! Yes, right this way.I've got 37 available units to show in this building so we're going to want to get right to it. Please step inside.There you go. Is that everyone? Good, good. Please make your way upstairs and we'll begin the tour.And you two make yourselves at home. Rent's due on the first, no overnight guests. Oh, and flush once after you boom-boom but before you start using the TP, and then once more in the middle of using the TP if you're going to use a lot. It's easier on the pipes. Okay. Call me if you need me. 
Jake:::Hey Finn. I'm real sorry about this. Somehow I feel like it's kinda my fault.
Finn:::Nah man. It's really not so bad. Let's just sleep on it tonight. 
Jake:::You're gonna sleep... like that?
Finn:::Yeah, man. It's tough. I'm a tough kid.
Jake::: I promise, I'll work this thi--Aaah! 
Creature:::Gee but it's great to be back home, eh Mr. B? 
Mr. B:::Haha, yeah. I can't wait to wash my gross, fat butt. 
Goblin::: Oh, oh holy cow. Oh, oh boy, please hurry. Yes, he's inside my apartment right now! Oh, I'm so scared!
Jake::: Hey buddy, you okay?
Goblin:::Glob, now there's two of 'em!
Jake::: I just feel if we're patient this whole thing will work itself out before you know it.Haha! See, man? Help is on the way!
Finn::: Man, can I tell you something? I don't even know what's going on here. I mean like, what the heck is a deed? How come he can buy our house when it's OUR house and Marceline gave it to us and we live there?! A-and now we're arrested?! This is crazy! It's crazy!! 
Jake:::Man, don't you know? The laws ain't made to help earthy cats like us.
Finn:::They're not?!
Jake:::Nah, man. Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old days, back in the REAL old days, it was just every man for hisself. Scrooblin' and scrat-scroblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scroblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, "The rest of you, y'all scrats get sand!" And THAT'S when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they liked it, they said, "This is fair now, this is the law." Once they were winning, they changed the rules up.
Finn:::Woah, just like Kim Kil Whan!
Banana Guard:::Hey, good news, fellas.Your bail's paid. You're free to go.
Jake:::Haha, that's awesome!
Finn:::Yeah, awesome!
Kim Kil Whan:::Yeah. Real "awesome."
Jake:::Hey, Kim Kil Whan! Aw buddy, I knew you'd come around!Haha, fathers and sons, man. That's that REAL thick chowder.What's this?
Kim Kil Whan:::This is a bill for the bail I just paid.
Jake::: Ooh. 
Kim Kil Whan:::You're really in it deep here, Dad. It's time for you to get real, get a job. No more games.
Jake:::Come on, son! Just let me do the-- 
Jake::: Man, where did I go wrong?
Finn:::I don't know. But I'm not tryin' to be sleepin' on a ladder anymore, so let's just get a bunch of scroot together and buy our house back. Then you two can hash it out later.
Jake::: Yeah, you're right. So, wanna rob a bank or somethin'?
Finn:::Well, actually...I was thinking maybe Kim Kil Whan was right.Maybe we should get jobs or somethin'.
Jake:::Oh yeah.... Yeah. Oh no, wait! I just remembered I buried a ton of gold in the front yard!
Finn:::Yuss!!
Kim Kil Whan::: Oh yes, yes, absolutely. Small pets are allowed with an additional deposit.Excellent.
Finn::: Watch it!
Kim Kil Whan::: Excuse me.
