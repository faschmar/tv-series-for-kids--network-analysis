Randy:::Hey, I'm Randy.
Davey::: Randy, wanna get dinner tonight?
Randy::: Nah, I'm busy. I like to wonder at night.
Jake::: Finn what's going on?
Davey:::You gotta start calling me Davey, mister. Because that's my name!
Davey:::Daaaaaaaaaavvvveeeeeeyyyyyy!!!
Jake::: Oh, no! Have you lost your teacups, man?
Davey::: Mister, I don't know nothing about that. I'm just a working joe... trying to stake my claim... under the sun... and look out on the beautiful green fields called... life!
Jake::: Uhhhhhhhh........
Randy::: Hey, Davey, where do you want these logs?
Davey::: Oh, just attach 'em to the cabin. Like how it should be. So it looks like a cabin. We're gonna build a right wall and front wall. Ummmmm-
Randy::: How about the roof? 
Davey::: Maybe, maybe.
Randy::: I've been holding these.
Davey::: They look good.
Randy::: How do you put good looking wood on a cabin?
Jake::: Gotta figure a way to get Finn to act normal.

BMO::: Watch out! A robber!
Jake::: I'll cut you! I mean, rob you! 
Davey::: Oh, no!
Jake::: I'm a robber and I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me. Unless there's a hero around here.Like there's someone here who is actually a hero in disguise. They can probably stop me.C'mon, Finn. Be a hero.
Randy::: What? What are we talking about?
Jake::: Butt out, Randy!
Randy:::Uhhhhhhhhhhhh.........
Jake:::Yes, Finn. Put on your awesome hat and beat me up.
Randy::: What?
Jake::: I'm not talking to you, Randy!
Davey:::I called the police.
Jake::: Wait, what?
Jake::: Guys, it's not what it looks like! That guy isn't really named Davey. It's Finn! He brainwashed himself to become Davey and I was just trying to inspire him to go back to being Finn.
Banana Guards::: Yeah, yeah. We've heard that before. C'mon robber!
Jake:::Finn, don't let the dragon drag on, man. Don't let the dragon drag on!
Davey:::Don't let the dragon........ Jake!
Randy:::Well that was pretty unusual, wasn't it, Davey?
Davey::: Get outta here Randy!Geeeet ouuuuut! 
Davey:::No more Davey.
Mustache::: But you love being Davey.
Finn::: I do love being Davey, but being Davey caused Jake to get arrested.
Mustache::: But remember that time when Davey sat in the park and saw some people walking around?
Finn::: Yeah, that was nice.
Mustache::: And remember that time when Davey swept the floors?
Finn:::Yeah, that was great, too. But-
Mustache::: Do you really wanna go back to being a famous hero? Why not just be Davey? A simple man... with simple goals and simple problems. You can just blend in and live the simple life.
Finn::: Yeah.... Blend in. Y'know, maybe I'll be Davey just one more time! 
Davey::: One more time!
