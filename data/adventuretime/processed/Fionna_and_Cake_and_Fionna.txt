Finn:::These ghoul dudes take the form of whatever you're thinking about.
BMO:::An angry -- no, shy shark baby.
Finn:::What if life was always just constant fun times on the river?
Jake:::Let's never do anything boring ever again.
BMO:::Yes, let's never do anything boring ever ag--Time for Ice King's boring book reading.
Finn:::Aw, come on! He's just gonna read those weird stories that are basically about us.
Jake:::I kind of dig getting loosely adapted.
Ice King:::Fionna spoke with the voice of an angelic choir. "You can have the rest of the screaming chili cheese dip if you want," she said."It's totally fine." The end.
Ice King::: I said "the end"!
Turtle Princess:::Let's get some questions.
Banana Guard::: Where do your ideas come from?
Ice King:::They're beamed into my melon at night - same as everybody else. Next!
Unknown voice:::I have more of a criticism than a question.
Ice King::: I am very open to criticism!
Unknown voice:::Your story was completely wrong.
Ice King::: And how would you know?
Unknown voice:::I know... because I am... Fionna!
"Fionna":::I can show you what really happened. It's all on this tape!
Audience:::Ooh!
Banana Guard:::What format is that?
Fionna:::According to this map, we're very close. There's the door.
Fionna:::Aw, it's locked.
Cake:::I'll get us in with key... eye!
Cake:::Bam! "Eye" got it. You get it, Fionna?
Fionna:::Yeah, but it's a stretch.
Other Fionna::: There I am.
Fionna::: Next time we find a map lying in the backyard, we should think twice.
Cake:::At least we get this fancy coffin.
Cake:::How's it look?
Fionna:::It's a decent addition to the treasure vestibule but still kind of a letdown.
Cake:::You know what's never a letdown? Cookie sauce review party.
Fionna:::Yeah! Cookie dip. Screaming chili cheese versus sriracha ranch.
Peppermint Butler:::Was it real?
Banana Guard:::Who was filming all that?
Gunter:::Wenk, wenk.
BMO:::Needs more hunks!
Finn:::Dude, I literally have one bazillion questions.Uh, excuse me, Miss Fionna... Where did this video come fr-o-o-m!
Ice King:::Fionna! I always knew we'd meet one day and become best friends. So, uh, remember that time when Cake caught Ruse Goose, the notorious goose pickpocket?
"Fionna":::That was such a long time ago.
Ice King:::But during trial, you realized she was framed 'cause it was actually Abracadanielle pretending to be a goose all along!
Banana Guard:::Can I also ask a question?
Ice King:::Besties only.
Banana Guard:::I was just gonna ask if we could see more of the tape.
Ice King:::Oh, yeah, can we?
"Fionna":::I don't think so.
"Fionna":::All right, just a little more.
Fionna:::Oh... my... glob. It's a mummy!
"Mummy":::That's right. I'm a mummy!
Fionna:::Aww.
Cake:::Yeah, you are. And a real cutie, too.
"Mummy":::I'm not cute! I'm horrible! 
Fionna:::Wanna hang?
"Fionna":::Okay, that's enough.
Ice King and Banana Guard:::Aw!
Ice King:::I want to see more.
"Fionna":::I don't want to wear it out. It's my only copy. And it's very important to me.
Turtle Princess:::Library closes in five.Click, click, click.
Ice King:::So, where you heading now?
"Fionna":::Guess I'll go back to the dump under the bridge where I live. I'd invite you over, but I don't have a sofa or TV or anything. It's literally a dump.
Ice King:::I have a TV. My crib is equipped.
"Fionna":::Oh, really?
Ice King:::Hey, you should move in! Please live with me, Fionna.
Ice King:::This is the sweet spot. My roo--Oh! I wasn't expecting guests.Not that you mind a bit of dirt, right?
Ice King:::Nice, huh?
"Fionna":::So, this is my room now.
Ice King:::Only the best for Fionna.
Ice King:::Oh yeah, I like this room too. It's where I do all my deep thinking. Man, I still can't believe it-- the Fionna in my bathroom, touching my toothbrush, throwing it into my little trash can. Fionna taking charge!
"Fionna":::That's what heroes do.
Ice King:::You're a so much better hero than Finn.
"Fionna":::I know.
Ice King:::Plus, don't tell Jake, but I've always been more of a cat person. Where is Cake the Cat?Cake? Cake?
"Fionna":::Cake is gone. Some years back, there was an adventure mishap. I don't feel comfortable talking about it.
Ice King:::Oh, okay.
"Fionna":::Hey, you still haven't shown me where you keep your Fionna and Cake tapes.
Ice King:::Sorry, no can do.
"Fionna":::What? Don't you have tapes?
Ice King:::Oh, yeah, I got loads of tapes, but they're super private.
"Fionna":::Maybe you'll change your mind once you see more of my mummy adventure?
Ice King:::Yay! I'll get snacks.
Fionna:::Hey, what's wrong?
"Mummy"::: I have... a curse!
Fionna and Cake::: Oh no.
Fionna:::How can we save you, tiny mummy?
"Mummy":::The curse can only be broken by strong black coffee and fancy muffins from Breakfast Kingdom.
Fionna:::I know that place. It has a really long line on weekends.
"Mummy":::Yes! That sounds like the one. Be a hero and fetch unto me the sacred breakfast.
Cake:::Don't you worry, little guy.
Fionna:::We'll save you!
"Fionna":::Okay, that's the end of the tape.
Ice King:::Really? My stories usually get wrapped up neater.Wrapped up -- mummies.
"Fionna":::Yeah, well, there's no more, so...You wouldn't know this, but old heroes need a lot of sleep.
Ice King:::I did know that.
"Fionna":::See you in the morning.
Ice King::: Okay.
Ice King::: Fionna? You awake? I made you a midnight snack.
Fionna::: Mummy, we're home.
Ice King::: I knew it.
Fionna:::Where did it go?
Cake:::Maybe it had to go back into its coffin Dracula-style.
Fionna:::Mummy?
Cake:::We got you breakfast.
Fionna:::Hmm.
Cake:::Shh! What's that?
"Mummy":::Nyeh!
Fionna:::That's our treasure!
"Mummy":::Stay away. You'll get cursed. 
Fionna:::I take the curse off of me and put it back on you.
"Mummy":::You understand nothing of mummy curses! 
Fionna:::Our treasure!
Cake:::Our muffins!
Queen of Ooo:::Uhh... Do not look upon a naked mummy. It's bad luck.
Fionna and Cake::: Queen of Ooo?!
Queen of Ooo:::That's right. I snuck in here to pretend to steal your stash and teach you a valuable lesson. Never invite strangers into your home, no matter how cool they seem and are. You should be thanking me really.
Ice King:::Of course. She didn't want me to see the end of the tape because she's not Fionna. She's... a mummy!Aah!
"Fionna":::Come on. They're all just him?
Ice King:::Imposter! Reveal yourself! 
"Fionna":::Aah! Knock it off!
Ice King:::You're the knock-off!
"Fionna":::What?
Ice King:::You're not Fionna!
"Fionna":::How did you--
Ice King:::Show me your true form!
Ice King:::Aha! Huh? What kind of mummy are you supposed to be?
Rabbit Lady:::No kind! I'm just an old lady.
Ice King:::Who likes to dress up as Fionna?
Rabbit Lady:::It makes me feel confident, okay? Plus I look really good in this outfit.Look, I used to be very shy, tinkering with my tech stuff all night, sleeping all day. But one evening, I intercepted a strange signal. I was mesmerized. I watched that tape like a hundred times before I finally stepped out of my cave a new woman, determined to find more Fionna and Cake. I roamed Ooo for years with no luck. But then I found out about you, and I hatched a plan to steal your tapes.
Ice King:::What? I don't have any Fionna and Cake tapes.
Rabbit Lady:::I know! All of your tapes are filled with embarrassing diaries.
Ice King:::If I met them, I'd definitely record it.
Rabbit Lady:::Fionna and Cake aren't real, you ding-dong! They're just, like, a TV show from the past or something.
Ice King:::You're the ding-dong, lady! You tricked an old, defenseless Ice King. 
Rabbit Lady:::Look, I didn't mean to hurt you.
Ice King:::You lied to me. Fionna would never lie -- never.
Rabbit Lady:::Oh, glob, you're right. I'm not like Fionna. I'm the mummy! Oh glob! 
Gunter:::Wenk.
Ice King:::Huh? Well, that was disheartening.
Rabbit Lady::: Forgive me, Fionna!
Fionna::: Cake, what time is it?
Gunter:::Wenk.
