Finn:::Mm, maybe we should try someone else.
Jake:::What? But we have history with him—that's important in business.
Finn:::Yeah, but we're lookin' for a sword. Remember that armor he sold us? 
Jake::: Ooh. Yeah, okay.
Jake:::I asked around. This is the place to get sa-words. 
Finn:::Oh. Doesn't look like it's open.
Finn & Jake:::Open! 
Voice:::Close the curtains behind you, please.
Voice:::Walk towards the candle.
Man:::How can I help you?
Finn:::Need a sword.
Man:::Hold on.Here you go::: a grass sword. It's a bargain.
Finn:::I don't know. I've never used a grass sword before. Maybe we should keep lookin'.
Man:::Swords like this don't come around every day.
Finn:::Don't come around every day, uh?I love it.
Jake:::Well, that was easy.
Man::: Remember, no take backs.
Jake:::Hey, the pillow vendor!
Finn:::Huh? Hyut! 
Jake:::Huh? Pizza?!
Finn:::Yeah! Came outta nowhere! It was gonna bonk you on the head.
Jake:::You're getting good with that sword. You were never able to do that with your other swords.
Finn:::No more pizza bonks. Hyut!Hey, we're near Tree Trunks' house. Let's stop by and get some pie.
Jake:::Pie!
Finn::: Hyut! Hyut!
Finn:::Hyaaaah!
Tree Trunks:::Howdy, boys! Nice pillow and nice sword. My hands are full, Finn. Uh, you mind slicin' an apple for me? 
Finn:::Hyut! 
Tree Trunks:::Something is terribly wrong with that awful sword.
Jake:::He's gettin' really good. He saved me from pizza.
Tree Trunks:::That apple slicing is too perfect... demonically perfect. That sword is cursed!
Jake:::I like it when Tree Trunks gets all serious.
Jake:::Uh, how's that curse doin'? Makin' you want to moidle me? 
Finn:::No, man. This sword doesn't seem to have any curse on it, as far as I can tell.Hyah!
Jake:::Well, okay.Dang tag.

Jake:::Hmm?
Finn:::Whoa!
Jake:::Hey, quit showin' off, bro!

Finn:::The sword is after my flesh!
Jake:::Huh?
Jake:::Oh, snap!
Finn:::Don't let it get me, Jake!
Jake:::Don't worry. I'll handle this.There.
Finn::: Let's go return that junk.
Jake:::Huh. Hey, he's not here.
Finn:::Hmm. Maybe someone around here knows where he is.
Finn:::Somebody in trouble!
Suzy & Sue:::Help! They're taking our candles!
Jake:::It's the Hooligans Who Love Candles!
Finn:::Let's get 'em!Hey!
Hooligans carrying candle:::Huh?
Hooligan:::Yo! You got a prob, Bob?

Hooligan:::Happy birthday. 
Hooligan::: You're dead, teddy boy.
Finn:::No.
Suzy & Sue:::You've saved our shop!
Sue:::Thank you so much, you brave young man.
Suzy:::And don't even worry about the damages.
Sue:::We'll just use the broken pieces to build a life-sized candle in your likeness.
Suzy:::Oh, and we'll put it right by the entrance, and it'll be our mascot—the candle man!
Jake:::Dude... 
Finn:::Yeah... not comin' off.
Jake:::Don't give up, man. Hey, maybe Choose Goose knows where the old man went.
Jake:::Hey, Choogles! We need your help. We gotta find the dude who sold us this cursed sword. You know who he is?
Choose Goose:::I know you did business with some rando guy. Help you backstabbers—Why should I?
Jake:::What? Come on, Choogie, it was only one time.
Choose Goose:::Hmm.
Finn:::I made a mistake, CG. This merch is totally defective.Please.
Choose Goose:::Okay-dokay... I know that quack with the grassy shack. He's a wizard from the grassy plain. He lives atop the grassy moun... tayn.
Jake:::Awesome. Wizard of Grassy Moun-tayn... Mountain. Yeah, thanks, Choogs.
Finn:::Yeah, thanks!
Choose Goose::: He's the only one who can lift the curse, but beware...
Choose Goose:::He's a huge ding-wad—just the worst.
Finn:::Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!
Finn:::Hmm. For a cursed dingus, you cut so good.
Finn:::Come forth, wizard, and uncurse my mitt! Grassy Mountain Wizard!
Grassy Wizard:::Comin' up here tryin' to enter my house! Are you for real?!Mow 'em down, my cursed grassy objects! 
Finn:::Hyah! 
Grassy Wizard:::Uh... go forth! Go... uh, forth.That was all my grassy objects.
Finn::: Lift the curse.
Grassy Wizard::: Never! You have no power over me, young fool! The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity! 
Finn::: Hmm. You know what?I think I'm cool with that.
Grassy Wizard:::What?
Finn:::Whoa.
Jake:::Now that you've accepted it, you can control it!
Finn::: Yeah.This is really cool!I just had to get used to it. 
Grassy Wizard:::That's not how people are supposed to react to an eternal curse!
Finn & Jake:::Whatevs.
Jake::: Do it again!
