Ice King:::Okay, Gunter! You ready for the show to begin?!
Gunter::: Wenk! 
Ice King::: One, two, three...Gunter! It's rhetorical, Gunter. Marceline's songs are so good! Mmm... Maybe I can get Marceline to write a song with me!Man, if she helped me write a song like that, I'd be crushin' it nonstop with the princesses! Ooh, yeah!Heh! Gunter, you cute little dummy. You know, Gunter, my song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in. Hmm.
Ice King::: Jay T. Doggzone always says, "Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts." And I've got a way tortured past! ...I think. I don't really... re...Hmm.Quickly, Gunter! To the "The Past" room!
Ice King::: Lot of emotional, powerful stuff in here.Still wet with tears... I'll take some-a' these for lyrical inspiration.So where's Marceline living these days?
Penguin::: Wenk.
Ice King::: A cave?? 
Finn:::Well, well, well. Looks like the Ice King is up to bad biscuits, brotha.
Jake::: Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro.
Finn::: Ice King, you make our job too easy. You ready to roll on this fool?
Jake::: Dinner roll!
Ice King::: Hello? Anybody home?
Marceline:::No...What are you doing here? I told you not to come around me!
Ice King:::Uh, yeah, I know, but... I was hoping you could help me write a song—one that could help me get some princess action.
Marceline::: I'm not gonna help you pick up on chicks!
Ice King:::Come on! We could be a prog rock duo! I'll even split the fans with you. I get the princesses, and you get... whatever it is you're into. Sounds good, yeah, I think it does!Ee-yoop!
Marceline:::Hey!!
Ice King::: Eh...
Marceline::: Get outta here!!
Ice King::: Wait! Just let me play you what I've written so far!Oh. Dang it. Tangles in the cord. Sometimes this happens when you fly with it... Tangles are hard...Oh. Aw, aw, geez, no... Oh, no.Ice King's in trouble. Hey, you know what? I'll just hum it for ya.Is that good?
Finn & Jake::: Ice King!

Marceline::: No, he can stay.
Finn & Jake::: Wha?!
Ice King::: Yeah, "Wha?!"
Marceline::: It's alright. We're working on a song together. 
Finn::: You don't want us to......for you?
Marceline::: No, it's okay. You guys can go.

Marceline::: Oookaaaay...
Ice King::: Yeah. Yeah, that's good! Keep doin' that!Slime Princess, you're alright. Flame Princess, you're okay. Wildberry Princess could be better. All of the princesses are pretty alright, but... Oh, Bubblegum! You look like a lot of fun! I'm right outside, and that is how I know! Hey, princess, did you get my text with a picture of my awesome gun show? I'm also workin' on my pecs! If you like, I'll send a picture of that, too! Oh, Bubblegum!I really need someone.Or anyone!...Pretty much anyone.

Marceline::: Huh?
Ice King::: Whatcha got? An apple?
Marceline:::Ugh!You're so annoying, you pitiful old man. I'd like to help you, but I don't know if I can. I thought you were nuts, but you're really really really nuts.Every time I move, eventually, you find me, and start hanging around. Just another lame excuse to see me. Man. It's getting me down. You know, I'm actually glad... to see you!Maybe I'm the one who's...nuts.
Ice King::: Hold on!Do you... like me?!
Marceline::: ...Of course I do, you old jerk!

Ice King::: Yes, I do! I am a lyricist!It's all here! On the page! The page in song, baby! On this receipt! On this takeout menu! On these newspapers! 
Marceline::: Huh? Look! This clipping! This was you, Simon! Before the War!

Ice King::: Ooh, ooh, are they good lyrics?I'll get the keyboard!
Marceline::: What?Wait, listen!
Ice King:::Yeah, let's go! What's it say? Sing out, sister!
Marceline:::"Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world? That must be so confusing for a little girl. And I know you're going to need me here with you... but I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're going to lose me, too..."
Ice King::: Ooh, yeah! Keep it going! 
Marceline:::Oh! Um..."This magic keeps me alive, but it's making mecrazy, and I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please forgive me for whatever I do...when I don't remember you."
Ice King:::Wow! I wrote that?! Hot stuff!
Marceline::: What?! You don't remember what it means?!Look!
Ice King:::"Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away. I can't remember what it made me say... but I remember that I saw you frown. I swear, it wasn't me. It was the crown.This magic keeps me—"
Ice King & Marceline:::"—alive, but it's making me crazy,and I want to save you, but who's going to save me?! Please forgive me for..."
Jake::: What is goin' on in there?!
