Finn:::What's shakin'?
Jake::: I-I don't know. I think I'm still asleep
Finn::: What if I'm still asleep?
Jake::: Then we're sharin' the same dream, dude.Look out your window!
Finn::: Aah! Dream monster!
Finn::: Quick, let's go enjoy this dream before we wake up!
Finn & Jake:::Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream...
Jake::: Whoaaaaa!
Finn::: ...Dreamy, dream, dream...
Jake:::Hey, man, I don't think this is a dream.
Finn::: Hmm? 
Finn::: Oh, well, then it's time to get real. 
Voice::: Help! Somebody help! Help! Help me! Help me!
Finn::: The monster ate somebody! We have to go inside its guts!
Jake:::Ughhhh, monster guts.
Jake:::Bleh.
Voice::: Help! Somebody help!
Finn::: Hyup! 
Jake:::Eeeeeeee!
Jake::: Ohhhhh. It's gross!
Finn::: 
Bear::: Help!
Finn:::C'mon!
Bear::: Help! Help me... hang these streamers! 
Finn & Jake::: What?!
Bear::: It's not a party without streamers!Doot-doot-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo 
Finn::: Dude, this isn't a party! We gotta get you outta here!
Finn::: Jake, help me!
Bear::: It's starting!Hehehehehehe!
Finn::: These crazy bears don't know they're in danger!
Jake::: Well... we should go.
Finn::: Jake, wait. We have to help them.
Jake::: They're partying! They're fine.
Finn:::Okay, Jake, what happens when you eat food?
Jake::: Well, it goes into your stomach...
Finn::: Yeah...?
Jake::: ...and then it stays there for a bit, and then it turns into— They're all gonna turn into... the stuff!
Finn:::Hey, excuse me! Excuse me! I don't know how you don't know this, but y'all are partyin' in a monster's stomach!
Bear::: Thanks! I love dancing!
Finn::: No!Y'ALL... are PARTYIN'... in a MONSTER'S... STOMACH!
Bear:::I THINK HE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE THE BATHROOM IS!
Other bear:::IT'S OVER THERE!
Someone off screen::: Hey...
Cubby::: I'm Cubby.
Finn::: Hi, Cubby.
Jake::: What's goin' on?
Cubby::: I heard what you said... about this being a monster's belly? I've been telling everyone that for three days!
Finn::: Why won't they listen?
Cubby::: 'Cause I'm just a kid!
Older bear::: Cubby! Are you bothering these guys with your fantasy stories?
Cubby::: No! I wasn't! I swear! I'm dancing, see? SEE?! 
Older bear::: Hmm... 
Finn::: Cubby, is there anything we can do to help?
Cubby::: You could talk to Party Pat.
Finn::: Party Pat?
Cubby::: He's our chief. If you can convince him to leave, all will follow.
Finn::: Can you take us to him?
Cubby::: Sure. He sleeps on the monster's heart. It's like a blood waterbed.
Cubby::: This is as far as I go. Party Pat is right around this corner. Bye, you guys!
Finn::: Bye, Cubby!
Jake::: Bye!
Finn::: Uhh... we're lookin' for Party Pat?
Finn::: Oh, uh...Well, listen. I know you don't know us, sir, but we need to talk.
Party Pat::: 
Finn::: It's pretty important, actually—
Party Pat:::Shhh-sh-sh-sh-shhhh. You know who I am?
Finn::: You're Party Pat?
Party Pat:::I'm the chief.
Finn::: Riiiight... right.
Jake::: You're the chief.
Party Pat:::Shhhh... before you talk to the chief, you must party with the chief.
Finn::: But—!
Party Pat::: It is the only way.
Jake::: Dude, we've been partyin' for hours.
Finn:::Yeah, he keeps drinking those honey-flavored energy drinks.
Finn::: How's your nausea?
Jake::: Full-blown.
Finn::: Hang in there, pal.Hey, Party Pat. You're the chief, and I totes respect that... but what we have to tell you is really important. And you said if we partied, we could talk.
Party Pat::: But you haven't been partying.
Finn::: What?!
Party Pat::: You move to music, but that's not dancing. You chew pancakes, but you're not tasting. To truly party, one must leave behind the problems that are troublingand open one'smind eye.I'm just kiddin'. You guys are party animals.This is just a sticker!You can stay in our cave as long as you want.
Finn::: That's what I've been trying to tell you, man! This isn't a cave—y'all are partyin' in a monster's BELLY!
Party Pat:::Oh, yeah. That makes sense. It's definitely the weirdest cave I've ever seen. Heh heh.
Finn::: So... you'll tell everyone to leave?
Party Pat::: Nah, we love it here.
Finn::: But you're all gonna die if you stay!
Party Pat:::Attention. Attention, everybody. Can I have your attention, please?So... apparently we're not in a cave.
Party Pat::: We're in a... MONSTER'S BELLY!
Party Pat::: 
Jake::: It's kinda peaceful.
Monster::: 
Finn::: All those bears... are gonna turn into the stuff.
Jake:::Shh. Seriously? The only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed, but they're not hurtin' nothin'.
Finn::: Yeah, good thing he isn't swallowing some deadly volcano lava. That would kill them for sure.
Finn & Jake::: Whoaa.
Finn::: The monster is headed toward that volcano!
Monster::: Uh-huh.
Finn::: We gotta warn the bears!
Finn::: If we bum everyone out, maybe they'll listen to us.
Jake::: Oh, okay.
Finn::: Just follow my lead.
Finn::: You bears gotta get outta here or you're all gonna be melted by lava!
Finn::: Party Pat, do you know of another exit?
Party Pat::: Well, there's the dark and mysterious mine, but nobody uses it anymore.
Finn:::He must be talkin' about the butt intestines! C'mon, Jake, we gotta get outta here!
Jake:::Ehhhhh.
Finn::: One more bandage.
Finn::: Huzzah! The party bears are safe, Party Pat. Y'all can party out here now.
Party Pat::: No. To survive, my people need a phat party club to grind in. That monster's gut was totally excellent.
Jake::: You're sick, Party Pat. I'm gonna go watch TV. 
Finn::: Hmmm. 
Monster:::Ohh...
Finn::: Pat, he's not gonna let you back in his mouth. You scorched it all up with fireworks! Unless... Party Pat!Party... pancakes.
Party Pat:::Hear me, monster. My people and I wish to party inside you once more. Prithee take us upon thine gut and we shall party no more with fireworks but insteadwith gentle lasers!
Finn::: Hey, Jake.Wait up!
