Finn::: Jake... you made this?
Jake::: Yeah!
Finn::: And you buried the treasure right here?
Jake::: Uh-huh.
Finn::: Jake! You're awesome!So cool...
Finn::: A suitcase?! Oh, man!
Jake::: I found it at the dump and then buried it without lookin' inside.
Finn::: Whoa. Wait a second, man. I know this case.
Finn ::: One night, while you were away at Lady's house, I was dancing in the woods...
Ice King ::: Evil tapes! Evil!
Finn ::: Perchance I saw the Ice King doing something suspicious, so I trailed 'im to the dump, where he buried this case in the ground.
Ice King ::: You're evil, tapes! Full of evil secrets! That's why I'm going to bury you where no one will ever find you... under all these boogers!Wee, hahahahaha! Wee, hahahaha!
Finn ::: I waited for him to leave... but he played in those boogers for hours. I decided to come back later for the case... but I lost track of it.
Jake::: Whoa! And I found it?
Finn::: Mm-hmm.
Jake::: Heh-heh-heh. Let's have a secret screening! I'll make some fliers for it!
Jake::: There. Now nobody will bother us.
Finn::: Jake! Jake, come on!
Finn::: Okay. You can play this , right, BMO?
BMO::: Yes, Finn. It goes in my butt!
Finn::: Oh.
Jake::: This is so exciting!
Ice King ::: Hello, dear diary. Pretty good day so far. Got up bright and early and had a healthy and slimming breakfast, did fourteen minutes of cardio (and then I finally got around to)...
Jake:::Dude... what are we watchin'?
Finn::: I think it's the Ice King's diary.
Ice King ::: ...I mean, I'm not gonna win carpenter of the year or anything, but it's a place to hang up the old toothbrush.
Penguin::: Wenk. 
Ice King::: Gunther? Hey, Gunther. Get-get away from the camera, sweetie. Papa's recording his innermost thoughts. 'Member? I explained this to you?Hey, Gunther?GUNTHER!!!
Penguin::: Wenk.
Ice King:::Well, anyway, as you can see, I'm not wearing my—
Penguin::: Wenk.
Ice King:::I'm not wearing my—
Penguin::: Wenk wenk.
Ice King::: Sweetie, I raised my voice because you were giving me the silent treatment. You understand?
Penguin::: Wenk.
Ice King::: I love you.
Jake::: Can we fast-forward?
Finn::: No, man, we might miss something.
Ice King :::There must be more to life than this...
Penguin::: Wenk.
Ice King::: I know. You don't like when I'm contemplative. ...C-contemplative... No, con-temp-la—Let's put on a play!
Jake::: What?!?
Ice King :::Oh, Ice King! You're so cool! You take such good care of yourself! I wanna be with you!
Penguin::: Wenk. Wenk wenk. 
Ice King::: No, Gunther, beard stays on.
Penguin::: Wenk.
Ice King::: Gunther, I need ya to wear the beard!
Penguin::: Wenk!
Ice King::: Gunther!
Jake::: Hey, pause it, BMO.
Finn::: There's gotta be some evil secrets in here. I wanna keep watching.
Jake::: Okay... Well, why don't I make us some snacks? So I don't have to watch... this...
BMO::: Can we sit on the floor? I feel so far away from you guys!
Penguin::: Wenk.
Ice King:::Now hold still...You moved! Hey, what's this?"Secret tapes"?! I wanna watch! I'll catch ya later, Gunther! 
Penguin::: Wenk!
Ice King ::: Gunther, no! Gunther...Dance pa—GUNTHER!Dance party! 
Finn::: Thanks, Gunther.
Jake:::You're Gunther. 
Ice King::: Oh, fine! Who needs you? More dance party for us, right, Gunther?Oh... Eh...May I have this dance? Heh! 
Finn::: There's probably some evil secrets coming up.Someone wants to see the secret tapes!
Jake::: What? Oh, but I was so clear in my flier!
BMO::: Let's peek through the window and check who it is! Maybe it's just pizza.
Finn::: Right!
Jake::: Wait! Wait!
Finn & BMO::: What?
Jake::: You guys are checking too loud!
Finn:::Oh! You're right.More quietly!
BMO::: I am quieter now.
Jake::: Cool.
Ice King::: Hey, guys, it's me. Can I come in and watch the secret tapes with you? I brought some gifts! 
Finn & Jake::: Aah!
Finn::: Okay. If we're quiet long enough, Ice King will think no one's home and go away.
Ice King::: Eh... No one's home. Guess I'll go away. 
Ice King:::Huh?
Finn::: Just turn your alarm off!
Ice King::: Hmm. That sounds like BMO! 
BMO::: My alarm says it's time for Finn's bath. Finn, get naked.
Finn:::No, just hit your snooze button!
BMO::: I cannot self-snooze. It's against my programming.
Finn:::Well, then, tell me how to do it!
BMO::: Press and hold.Then, press the button on top of my head.I'm sorry. ...We can still take a bath...
Finn::: He must know we're watching his tapes. We need to find his secrets faster.
Ice King ::: Oh, diary! Thank you for listening to me!
Finn::: Fast-forward, BMO.
Finn::: Play, BMO.
Ice King ::: So there we are. Turtle Princess is frozen and in my little ice wheelbarrow, and there was... magic in the air. We were both feeling it.But before I could leave the library, Finn and Jake show up. You know how Jake is. Stretch this, stretch that, bah! He knocks off my crown and then Finn bonks me on the nose. Still hurts, too. The worst part is Turtle Princess took away my library card!You know, dear diary, I'm starting to worry that all these entries sound exactly the same, and that my life is just me running in place on some... giant hamster wheel.
Jake:::Fast-forward, BMO.
Jake::: I'm gonna take a nap...
Finn::: No! These tapes are important! We just don't know why yet. BMO, fast-forward to triple speed!
BMO::: Okay.
Finn::: BMO, play normal speed.
Ice King :::Come on, baby... in the pocket...I can't do it...
Jake::: Maybe he's talkin' in secret code.
Finn::: Telling evil secrets in secret code... He's brilliant!
Jake::: Well, how do we decode the secrets?
BMO:::Why don't we call others for help?
Finn::: BMO, you're brilliant!
Jake::: Well, who do we call?
Finn::: Um... The smartest person we know, Princess Bubblegum!She's brilliant...
Finn::: Hey, Princess Bubblegum.
Princess Bubblegum::: Hey, Finn.
Finn::: Jake and I found a bunch of secret tapes! We were wondering if you'd help us decode them.
Princess Bubblegum::: Codes?
Jake:::Yeah, they're really stupid, but, y'know... Maybe they're encoded or whateva.
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh, you called the right person. I know a lot about codes. Let's start with—
Finn::: What?
Jake:::Ohh...
Finn::: Hey, Princess. We got disconnected.
Ice King:::Hello, Finny. 
Finn & Jake::: Hey/Uhhh, you sound weird!
Ice King::: Must be a bad connection. That's why we were disconnected earlier on the telephone.
BMO::: Ice King is on the phone outside!
Finn:::So... how's the weather in Candy Kingdom?
Ice King:::Oh, the usual. There's ice everywhere and it smells like penguins!
Finn::: The only thing that smells like penguins is you, Ice King!!
Ice King:::How did you—
Finn::: What're you doing?!
Ice King::: I wanna watch secret tapes with you guys. It'll be nice.
Finn::: No, man!
Ice King::: But—
Finn:::He doesn't know that we're watching his tapes. We gotta find these evil secrets before he uses them against us!
Ice King::: Oh... Fine. No more nice. NOW YOU GET ICE!!Try watching those tapes with FROZEN EYEBALLS!
