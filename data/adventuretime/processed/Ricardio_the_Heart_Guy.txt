Ice King::: I will kiss her! I will!Hold still.Mwah!
Finn:::You just kissed Jake's butt!
Ice King::: What?!EEEEGH!!The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, Princess—MINE!
Princess Bubblegum::: What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys.
Finn::: You're welcome, Princess.Uh... 
Princess Bubblegum::: I'm gonna throw you two a party. Meet at the Candy Kingdom—TONIGHT!
Jake::: That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum?
Finn::: I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift... in return for throwing us this party.
Jake::: Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt.
Finn::: What?
Jake::: I bet you wish you were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish you were the Ice King and the princess was my butt!
Finn::: What?!
Jake::: Hmm...OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha!
Finn::: That's ridiculous!Huh? Uggghhh!!What's so funny?
Peppermint Butler::: Hey, everybody. Finn and Jake are here.
Jake::: Who's ready to party?!
Finn::: What's everyone laughing at?
Wildberry Princess::: Shh!
Ricardio::: Stand back, everyone. This style of massage is called, "Best Friend Massage."
Lumpy Space Princess::: Oh, my gosh...
Ricardio::: Because it can only be done for friends. It is completely consensual.
Lumpy Space Princess::: Oh, holy cow...
Ricardio::: Relax yourself now, Lumpy Space Princess... YAH! 
Lumpy Space Princess::: Oh! I feel so great!
Finn::: Who is that guy?
Ricardio::: Hahaaa!
Princess Bubblegum::: Greetings, party-goers! Glad you could all make it!
Finn::: Princess Bubblegum!Princess. I just wanted to thank you for—
Lumpy Space Princess:::Oh, my gosh! PB, ya gotta check out this super cute guy. You're gonna love 'im. 
Finn::: Uhhh...
Lumpy Space Princess::: This is... Oh. Oh, my gosh. I don't even know your name.
Ricardio::: Ricardio. Ricardio at your service. I've been waiting all evening to meet you, Princess.Mwah!I've heard you appreciate ancient technology. Have you ever used the balbaflonic laser to align the hybernotalist rift in the bubaflon plasmodial formation?
Princess Bubblegum::: Whoa! No, I haven't!Wanna continue this conversation on the dance floor?
Ricardio:::It would be my pleasure, Princess.
Finn::: Why didn't the princess invite me to dance?
Jake::: If you wanna dance, just go dance!
Finn::: But now she's dancing with him! Ah... I feel... weird!
Jake::: Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy.
Finn::: BLAAAARGH!!
Jake::: Look, man, just go out there and get down! 
Ricardio:::—transmordial layers completely independent of the babylons. Eh?
Princess Bubblegum::: Wow! That would mean that the babylons would fluctuate with the piranha-nanosphere!
Ricardio::: Correct!
Finn::: Agh!They're talkin' about science, man! I can't compete with that!
Jake::: Do the Science Dance! Remember it? It was sorta like this.Wah unh we ah eeh...
Finn::: You think that'll work?
Jake::: Yeah! Probably.Do it, man! You're a pro!
Finn:::Science Dance! Science Dance!
Ricardio:::—lower proximities to—
Finn::: Science Dance! Hey, eh, Princess! You wanna spend some time with me?
Ricardio::: Excuse me, Princess. You must excuse me. 
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh, uh... Alright!Finn, what the cabbage? I was learning about Zanoits!
Finn:::Oh... I'm... into Zanoits! Th-They're the best!
Princess Bubblegum::: Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of Plantoids a year.
Finn::: Oh, no, not the Plantoids!
Princess Bubblegum::: Plantoids produce mellotoxin!Mellotoxin kills Zanoits!!
Finn::: ...So are Zanoits... good things?
Princess Bubblegum:::You're totally jealous of Ricardio.
Finn::: No, I'm not. I just don't like the way he talks to you. It makes me feel weird.
Princess Bubblegum::: That's jealousy, hun.
Finn::: I'm not jealous! I'M WEIRD!!!
Jake:::Woof! Man... This is goin' bad. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait.Wow, man, what happened out there?
Finn::: Agh... I don't know! I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and—
Jake::: Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too.
Finn::: I know! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain.
Jake::: Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?
Finn::: No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister!
Jake::: Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry.
Finn::: I'll prove he's a villain!
Jake::: How?
Finn::: Stakeout.
Finn::: Here he comes!They're talking!
Jake::: Lemme see.I can read their lips."Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!""You look kind of like a big pink baguette!"
Finn:::Get serious, Jake!! This is life and death!
Jake::: Is it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just looks wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice.
Finn::: I gotta trust my gut!
Jake:::Hmm.
Finn::: He's on the move! Let's roll!I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottles—and pretending to stab someone!
Jake::: So... he's recycling... or what?
Finn:::I think your gut's a little naive, Jake.Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something!Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!
Jake::: So I was right! He is a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious!You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!
Finn::: No way. This proves he's a super-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!
Finn::: Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!
Jake::: Or good!
Ricardio::: Oof!
Finn::: So what're you doin', Ricardio? Are you evil?
Jake::: Or nice with an evil face?
Ricardio::: That's none of your business.
Finn::: The safety of Princess Bubblegum is my business!
Jake::: Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not.
Ricardio::: Oh, yeah?
Finn & Jake ::: Yeah.
Ricardio::: Oh, yeah?
Jake::: Yeah.Yes!
Finn::: You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff!
Ricardio::: Now that my plan is nearly complete, there is no way you could stop me.
Finn::: I could stop you if I wanted!
Ricardio::: Oh, yeah?
Finn::: Yeah!
Ricardio::: Oh, yeah??
Finn::: YEEEAAAH!!!
Princess Bubblegum:::What's going on here?
Finn::: Princess?!
Princess Bubblegum::: Ricardio?!
Ricardio:::Yes... I'm alright, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn... why'd you do it?
Finn::: He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!
Princess Bubblegum::: These were for our balbaflonic laser.
Ricardio::: It's not all his fault, Princess. I might've looked a little threatening.
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business.
Finn::: But...
Princess Bubblegum::: C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy. 
Finn:::She hates me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio.
Ice King::: No, Finn!You were not wrong. He is evil! 
Finn::: Ice King! What do you know about this? Tell me or I'll do something!
Jake::: Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged!
Finn::: I don't care! I only care about Ricardio!
Ice King::: But my enervated condition has everything to do with him.I was trying to cast a spell that would give me total control of Princess Bubblegum's heart! ...But I messed it all up... and lost control of mine.He planned to rip out Princess Bubblegum's heart... to make it his bride.Without my heart, I grew weak.But I made my way to the Candy Kingdom to look for him. In an alleyway, I begged him toreturn to me and leave the princess alone.But he threw me in the dumpster and left me for dead.Stop Ricardio!
Finn:::Agh! Come on, Jake!Gotta save the princess!
Jake::: Princess Bubblegum!!
Finn::: Princess!! 
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn!! Jake!!
Ricardio::: You were right all along, Finn! Now I'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it!
Finn::: Not if I can help it!
Ricardio::: One step closer and I'll remove her heart!!
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn! I feel like a big idiot for doubting you! He was just so engaging! ...But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak.
Ricardio::: Shut your mouth up, Princess!I'm gonna smooch that heart!! It will be my bride!!
Finn::: Why don't you marry someone your own size?! Like my foot?!
Ricardio::: Huh?!
Finn::: And my fist?!
Ice King:::Stop! Stop it! That's my heart, you piece of—
Finn::: Ice King.Should we... let 'im take his heart back? He is... villainous...
Jake::: I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man.
Ice King::: Oh, yeah...
Ricardio::: Wait! Wait! No!
Ice King::: Come to daddy...
Ricardio::: Noooooooooo!
Ice King::: Yeah, there you go...Like that? Huh?
Ricardio:::Seeee you guys laterrrr...
Ice King:::I feel wonderful! Hahaha! And now that I've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day!
Finn::: No, she won't!
Princess Bubblegum::: Yeah, no, I won't!
Ice King::: Yes you WILL!Well... maybe not today... or tomorrow... but another day! Another—
Princess Bubblegum::: Thanks again for saving me... again.
Finn:::Don't mention it.
Princess Bubblegum::: Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore. 
Finn::: I never get jealous.
Princess Bubblegum:::Kiss me, Finn.Ahem.I mean... kiss me, Finn.Am I doing it right, Jake?
Finn::: NOOOOOOOO!!!
