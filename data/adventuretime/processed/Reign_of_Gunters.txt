Gunter:::Wenk. 
Ice King:::You know where it is? Lead the way! Oh boy, this is just wonderful!Hmnh.Agh! You just want me to brush you! You know this brush is for princesses only?Ah, princesses only. No Gunthers!
Ice King::: What are my options here? Hmm. Hm-hm.Gunther! What is your damage today?Ooh! Wizard market!W-I-Z-...
Ice King:::Hey!You're really peeving me off, Gunther! Go stand in the corner!
Ice King:::I said stand in the corner.
Ice King:::Ugh. You make me sick.Try not to break anything while I'm gone.

Penguins::: Wah! Wah! Grah!

Jake:::Huh?Hey!Now shoo, ya little creeps!Oh... this is unusual.
Finn::: Glip... driggle!
Jake::: Eh... What's with these super penguins?
Finn::: I don't know! I'm guessing it's the Ice King.
Jake::: Well, where is he, then?
Finn:::ICE KIIIIING! 
Ice King:::Wizards rule.
Ice King::: Doot-doo, deet-dee-doo. Ah, let's see.That's the symbol for magic items, right?Hey, this is the magic items shop, right?
Huntress Wizard:::What's it look like, ya donk?
Ice King:::I know that, I know! Why can't they write it on the sign, though? Why's it all gotta be secret? Let's just put it all out there, huh? Equal distribution of magic to the people!No more symbols! No more initiations!Ya feelin' me, Huntress Wizard?
Huntress Wizard::: You tryin' to get killed, Ice King?
Ice King:::Uh-uh, I was just steppin' to ya, girl, with my intellectual wizard politics.No, don't go.Well, "Swing at every ball," that's what Jay T. Doggzone says.Hello?
Bufo:::...So then he was telling me to beef in the eye of Glob and stuff.
Laser Wizard:::Whoa. Did you do it?
Bufo:::Heck yes, I did.
Forest Wizard:::Yo, I wouldn't do that.
Laser Wizard:::Get over it, man. Don't you want to reach the highest initiation of the secret schools?
Forest Wizard:::Of course, man. In shadow, we find the light...safely sealed in darkest night. So make sure y'all keep it tight. Wizards only, fools.
Ice King::: Keep what tight?
Laser Wizard:::A secret you never should've heard, Ice King.
Ice King::: Yo. Guys. Chill. I lost my Demonic Wishing Eye.Just get me a new one and I'll jet. I didn't hear nothin' about no weird, secret wizard club that I want to be a part of.
Forest Wizard::: Loose lips sink the ships, Ice King.
Bufo:::Sorry, man.Nothing personal.
Ice King:::Oh, slid—You guys!Ah!Whoa!
Jake::: Okay, I give up.
Finn & Jake:::Gunther?!
Jake::: Nice ice!
Finn:::What's goin' on here, man? Call off your super bros.
Jake::: Well, that's great.
Finn:::Where's the Ice King, Gunther?Gunther?! What? Alright.Whoa!
Finn & Jake:::WHAAAA!
Finn:::Is this happening everywhere?
Jake:::I don't know—lemme see.Whoop!Dang!
Finn:::What do ya see?
Jake:::Hold on.Oh no! NO!
Finn:::What, dude?!
Jake::: Hold on, man. Wait. Oh, Glob! This can't be happening!
Finn::: Tell me!
Jake:::Eh, it's over. We've been conquered.
Finn:::Who's been conquered?
Jake:::Everyone.
Finn::: By the Ice King?
Jake:::No, dude! By Gunther.
Finn:::Holy shmow! Gimme that!Gunther's heading for the Candy Kingdom! We gotta save them! 
Jake::: Whoa, okay. 
Finn:::Hurry, Jake! Wait—I'm still in my pajayjays.
Princess Bubblegum:::Yo, Finn, are you seeing these penguins?
Finn:::Yeah, it's Gunther! He's taking over the whole thing!
Princess Bubblegum:::Well, he'll have to beat my Banana Guards and my Gumball Guardians.
Jake:::That's not gonna work.
Princess Bubblegum:::What did he say?
Finn:::He says your plan is bunk.
Princess Bubblegum:::Well, what's your plan?
Finn:::I got a plan.
Princess Bubblegum:::You do?
Finn:::When we get there, I'll do my plan in addition to your plan. Two plans. Laters.
Princess Bubblegum:::Uh, alright, so you're not gonna tell me your—
Finn::: I'm outies!
Jake:::You're not gonna tell her the plan?
Finn:::No, I gotta be mysterious.
Jake:::What? I thought you weren't into Bubblegum anymore.
Finn:::I'm not. But this is how I act now with all the ladies, you see? I keep 'em in a state of confusion. That way, I've always got options in case Flame Princess doesn't work out.
Jake:::OH MY GOSH! Where is this coming from?!
Finn:::It's called "future farming." I read it in that book you have by Jay T. Doggzone.
Jake:::Jay T. Dogg—awww, dude! Don't read that book! It's gonna mess up your brain. I keep that book around for laughs. It's all really bad advice.
Finn:::Oh, okay. I'll stop it, then.
Jake:::No, well... you can still be mysterious—that's fine.
Finn:::What? Now I'm confused.
Jake::: Never mind—I didn't say nothin'.
Finn:::Hey P-Bubs! Are you ready?
Princess Bubblegum:::Yes. The calvary ' is standing by.
Finn:::Cool. I'm gonna rally some citizens and do this other plan.
Princess Bubblegum:::Okay, but what—?
Finn::: Good luck!
Princess Bubblegum:::Jake, what's with all the mystery?
Jake:::Uhhh...Oh snap, look out!
Princess Bubblegum:::Banana Guards, defend!
Princess Bubblegum:::Aw, jeez.
Gumball Guardian::: Evil presence detected. Must defend candy. Dange— aaah!
Princess Bubblegum:::You'll never get past these walls... I think.
Finn::: This... is my plan. I got the Candy Kingdom underground to help me collect all the bottles in the land.
Jake:::Breaking news::: that mystery plan of yours is a smash hit.Because the—of the glass... I guess all they care about is bottles, huh.
Princess Bubblegum:::But what'll happen when they run out of bottles?
Finn:::I won't let that happen, Prubbs.
Gunter::: We-e-e-e-e-enk...
Finn:::Stay back! 
Princess Bubblegum:::Wait a minute!Put away your weapons and we'll get you more bottles.
Finn:::Peeb! There aren't any bottles left!
Princess Bubblegum:::I have a third plan.
Jake:::So, we make them new bottles. Then the Gunthers break the bottles, and then we pick up the glass and make new bottles again?
Princess Bubblegum:::Yup.
Finn:::What, like, forever?
Princess Bubblegum:::Yes.
Finn:::Bubb, your plan... bunks.
Princess Bubblegum:::Heh, yeah.
Jake:::I like it. I got a rhythm goin'! 
Gunter::: Wenk!
Princess Bubblegum::: What? What do you want? I don't—
Finn:::He wants to smash the Gumball Guardian's head!
Princess Bubblegum:::We're going to make more bottles. Just wait, okay?
Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum:::NO!
Gumball Guardian::: Goodbye... Princess!
Ice King:::Hey. What's goin' on here? Why's this place all crazy? I was just flying by and—Gunther! You took my stuff!
Gunter:::Wenk.
Ice King:::That's bad. You know what you get now?!
Gunter::: Wenk.
Ice King:::That's right, you get the squirty-squirts.Bad, bad. Now take off my Demonic Wishing Eye.
Ice King:::Alright, Gunther. Now go home.
Gunter::: Wenk.
Ice King:::That's right, walk. And while you're walking home, you think about what you did.It's getting worse and worse with him. He just—he hates it when I leave the castle. I'm sorry, guys.
Jake:::Uh, dude? Where have you been?
Finn:::Yeah, and why are you all jacked up?
Ice King:::Heh... well, I got into some crazy wiz biz over in Wizard City. Honestly, I don't even know how I survived. Basically, it was the craziest showdown ever. I— I wish I could tell you all about it, but you know—"Wizards only, fools." Keep it tight.
