Finn:::SLAM!
Jake::: Hey! I was trying to read that!
Finn:::That book is above your level.
Jake:::What business are you into?
Finn:::None of your business!
Jake::: Talk about it over lunch?
Finn::: Heh, if you're buying.
Jake::: Hey!
Finn::: Hey!
Finn and Jake::: Fight!
LSP:::Ahh! it's terrible!
Finn, Jake and Princess Bubblegum::: Lumpy Space Princess!
Princess Bubblegum::: Whats wrong?!
LSP::: You guys! Somebody stole something from me! Something I can't live without!Â 
Princess Bubblegum::: I'll get something to calm her down. 
LSP::: I've been robbed! I've been robbed!
Princess Bubblegum:::Out of the way!
Princess Bubblegum:::I need help! Can you guys hold her down?
LSP::: Do something! I've been- ooh!Ohh! 
Princess Bubblegum::: Oops.
Finn::: LSP! Who robbed you?
LSP:::It...was...puh...pee...pete...sa...sas...as...
Princess Bubblegum::: I think I gave her too much.
Finn::: Jake. A crime has been committed. We must find the criminal.
Jake::: We must.
Finn:::And retrieve whatever it is that was stolen from Lumpy Space Princess.
Jake:::Stolen. But all we have to go on is part of a name. Pete something.Need more clues! Hold me! 
Finn::: Clues, clues, clues.
LSP::: 
Finn::: What's that? I can't see it.
Jake::: Oop, sorry.Aah!
Finn::: There's something in her hand!A key! A key to...what? Three zero three. Hmm.
Jake:::Ooh, turn it around! 
Finn::: Ah!Looks like we've got our first lead!
Finn::: Hmm. Find anything, Jake?
Jake:::Got some bags and...wait-more bags. But no leads on Pete something.
Finn:::Same here. BMO.Start marking evidence.
Jake::: Hmm.
Finn::: Hmm.
BMO:::Hmm.
Finn:::Dude, check this!Is this blood?
Jake::: Yeah man, that's definitely blood.
Finn::: Hmm. LSP's injuries were 100 percent emotional. So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. BMO, take a sample and do a full blood analysis.The works.Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There's a drugstore across the street!
Jake:::Let's roll. 
Finn::: Woah!
Ann::: And if the oozing persists, just come backand I'll give you something a little stronger.
Finn:::I'm Finn. This is my partner, Jake. 
Jake::: Hello, citizen. Had anyone in here looking to buy some mini adhesive bandages today?
Ann::: A lot of people come through my store, gentlemen. You can't seriously think I'd be able to remember any one particular customer among the countless others I see on a daily basis, now, can you?
Finn::: I guess not. Fair dues. C'mon, Jake.
Ann:::Wait! Now that you mention it, there was this one guy in here earlier. Real suspicious type. Had a nosebleed. Said it was the first one he'd had in years.Used to get them all the time as a kid, he said.Can never remember if he was supposed to pinch his nose and hold his head back, or pinch his nose and hold his head forward.Maybe it was a case of being boxed on the nose too many times.Made the blood vessels in his lower septum weak and vulnerable to hemorrhaging. Anyway, his mammy always said it was because he couldn't keep all those picky little fingers out of his dirty little nose holes.He didn't buy it though. He always thought it had-
Finn::: Ma'am, can you give us a name?
Ann::: Mmm, nope. No wait, yes I can. Pete Sassafras.
Finn::: Did you catch which way he was going?
Ann::: Of course! He said he was catching a train at 11:::27, Candy Kingdom Station, Platform 5. Heh. Sorry, I wish I could remember more.
Jake::: See anyone who might be our guy?
Finn:::Nope.Nobody's suspicious here. Just a load of decent law-abiding folk.What the-?! Jake! What's with all the turning into stuff today?
Jake::: I really like turnin' into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff.Hey, there's Platform 5!I see a nasty tranch!
Finn::: Let's book him, son.
Finn:::Stop right there! What's under that skeezy trenchcoat ya-
Blueberry Cop 1:::Crook!Busted! For attempting to board a train without a ticket.
Finn::: Oh, guys, he's getting away!
Jake::: We're not criminals, man! We're working the beat, just like you!
Blueberry Cop 1::: Jimmy?
Blueberry Cop 2 (Jimmy):::Yup. Checks out. He tastes like police.
Blueberry Cop 1:::Sorry about that, officers, it was an honest mistake.
Finn:::Ugh. We lost him.
Jake::: Not yet we didn't! 
Finn::: Ugh! It's too far ahead! We'll never catch it.
Jake::: If we cut through the forest, maybe we can head it off at the pass.
Finn::: Sweet thinkin'.
Finn and Jake::: Yeah!
Finn::: Are you Pete Sassafras?
Pete Sassafras::: Wha-? Uh, I got a lot of names. Who's askin'?
Jake:::Give back what you stole from LSP!
Pete Sassafras::: Who? What's that, an acronym or somethin'?
Finn::: Cuff 'em.
Jake::: Ehh, I got this.You have the right to remain... busted.
Pete Sassafras::: Alright, you listen, flatfoot. There's been some kind of crazy mistake here. I didn't do nothin'!
Jake::: Save it for the candy judge, Pete.
Finn::: Look, you can cut the act and drop the sass, Sassafras. We've got an eye-witness and your blood at the scene of the crime.
Jake::: You do the crime, you do the time, man!
Finn::: Roll the dice, you pay the price.
Pete Sassafras::: What dice? Oh, you guys are donkers.
Jake::: Burgle our friend, it's the end.For you!
Pete Sassafras::: I wanna see a lawyer.
Lawyer::: I'll handle this, Pete. You're upsetting my client. Just look at that face. That constitutes harassment, so give him some space. Don't worry buddy, I got this case.
"Lawyer":::Welcome to the next twenty-five years of your life.
Finn:::We deserve donuts.
Jake::: Let's ball. 
Pete Sassafras::: No, wait, please! You guys!
"Lawyer"::: Guilty! 
Finn::: Man, we didn't just crack that case, we crunched it! Crumbled it!
Jake::: We are awesome at being cops!No question about that.
Finn:::Call me crazy, but I was thinking maybe we should actually become detectives. Like, as a job! When we were out on the streets back there, getting those leads, busting that perp, it just felt so...I don't know...right.
Jake:::I know, man. I actually totally do know exactly what you mean.
Finn:::Aw, dude. 
Jake::: I told you::: I have a problem. I can't stop!
BMO:::Howdy, partner.
Finn::: Oh hey, BMO. What's going on?
BMO::: I finished processing the blood sample. And I have the result.
Finn::: Nice!
Jake::: Yeah, good work, BMO!
Finn::: It's Pete Sassafras's blood, right?
BMO::: No. It doesn't belong to anyone because it's not blood. It's tomato sauce.
Jake::: Tomato sauce?
Finn::: Hmm...Oh my mind! LSP wasn't trying to say "Pete Sa-something"; she was trying to say "Pizza something!"
Jake::: But how would pizza sauce end up in a hotel room?
Finn:::Unless it was delivered.
Finn and Jake::: Pizza Sassy's!
Finn::: Where's the delivery guy?!
Man behind the counter::: Oh, you mean Petey. He's out. He's makin' deliveries.
Jake:::Or maybe he's out tying up loose ends!
Finn:::LSP could be in danger!
Jake::: Danger! 
Finn::: Phone?
Man behind the counter::: Phone. 
Finn:::Princess! Have some Banana Guards outside of LSP's hospital room!
Princess Bubblegum::: Huh? Why?
Finn::: LSP could be in danger!
Princess Bubblegum::: LSP woke up and went back to her hotel room.
Finn:::OH MY JAM!!!
Finn and Jake::: He's already here! 
Woman behind counter::: Can I help you?
Finn and Jake:::LSP! 
LSP::: It was you! You did it!
Petey::: Help me! I was just delivering the pizzas she ordered. And now she won't let me leave.
Finn::: LSP, what is going on? You said he stole something from you.
LSP::: He did! He stole...my heart! 
Finn::: Hurry up, dude!
Jake::: Shh!
Finn::: Right.
Petey::: Thanks!
Finn::: Shh. Go, go!
Petey:::Yeah, no tip, huh? That's great. That's how it is, around here. Fine.
Jake:::Huh, huh? Come on pal. Turns out the only case here is just another case of LSP being nutty!
