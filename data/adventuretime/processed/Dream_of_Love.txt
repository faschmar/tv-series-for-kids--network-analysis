Finn::: Y'all are too affectionate. It makes people feel... bothered when you and the Pig your affection in public!
Tree Trunks::: They don't want us to flaunt what we have?

Finn::: Then, why don't you two just get married?
Tree Trunks::: We don't wanna rush things-

Mr. Pig::: I guess I'll just go back to eating criminals.I miss her...
Tree Trunks::: I don't know what I'm going to do without him, Finn!
Finn::: Why don't you make apple pie to take your mind off of it?
Tree Trunks:::Dream of love... Is it really over? Can I overcome these tears? I close my eyes, feel that he's still with me. Still standing with me here...
Mr. Pig::: Dream of love... Are we truly parted? Must this Pig forever walk alone? In my dreams, our love is just a dream to me... but in my heart, it lives and breaths and grows.
Tree Trunks:::And even though, we ain't allowed to be together. I cross my heart and promise to be true.
Mr. Pig::: Well, I'm still lovin' you, girl, from halfway 'cross this great, big, world!And in my dreams, I'm holding hands with yoooooooooooou!
Tree Trunks & Mr. Pig::: Dream of love... Dream of love...It's only a dream of loooooove. Dream of love... Dream of loooooooove, it's only a dream... of love.
