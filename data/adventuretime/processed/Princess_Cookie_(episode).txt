Cookie::: Donkin' Princess...
Princess Bubblegum::: Okay, okay. How about I give you a big cowboy hat? Then will you let the hostages go?
Cookie::: No... no!Don't play games with me, Princess. I want that crown. No crown, no hostages.
Princess Bubblegum:::Well, obviously that's going to be a problem, because I'm the princess and I need my crown. So...
Cookie:::No, Princess! You are problem—the problem princess!Just gimme that crown! 
Jake:::Why does he want your crown anyway, Princess?
Finn:::Yeah, what's his beef?
Princess Bubblegum:::I don't know, guys—he's crazy. He's left me no choice. I'm sending in the banana guards. It's about to turn crazy nasty.Hello. Captain Banana Guard?
Jake::: Wait a second, Princess. Why don't me and Finn just sneak in there incognito and neutralize the threat, old-fashioned spy guy-style?
Princess Bubblegum:::Hmm. Okay, but if you guys aren't out of there by4:::00, I'm sending in the guards.
Jake::: Okay, I was thinkin' I coulddress up like a mailman.
Finn:::Yeah. Yeah, and I could wear all black and I could be like, you know, like, your shadow.
Princess Bubblegum:::Hmm. I can't really see that working.
Jake:::Yeah, the shadow thing might be pushin' it.
Princess Bubblegum:::Oh, no-no-no, that part's fine. I was talking about you dressing up like a mailman.
Jake:::What? But I always wanted to be a mailman.
Princess Bubblegum:::Nah, you don't look like a mailman. You look like a milkman. Let's get you a proper milkman outfit.
Jake:::You ready?
Finn:::Yeah. Let's bust it.
Jake:::Hello.
Cookie:::"Hello"?! Who the heck are you?I'm gonna smash your face.
Jake:::Uhh, milkman, sir. I brought the milk—for the hostages, sir.
Cookie:::Huh? Oh. I thought maybe you were a spy guy or somethin'. Go ahead, give everyone some milk, then get the math outta here.
Jake:::Yes, sir.Milk, sir?
Marshmallow:::Thanks.
Jake:::Milk?
Candy Person #103:::Thanks.
Jake:::Milk?
Marc:::Thank you.
Jake::: Some milk?
Finn:::Psst! Get ready, Jake. When we get to the cookie, you throw some milk in his face and yell, "Alvin's hot juice box. Alvin's hot juice box." He'll be really confused, and that's when we grab him and tie him up-style.
Chipper::: Come in, Cookie. This is Chipper. Over.
Cookie:::Go ahead, Chipper. Over.
Chipper:::I'm too short to lock the back door. Over.
Cookie:::Hold tight, Chipper. Chipler's on his way.You got that, Chipler?
Chipler:::Affirmative. 
Jake:::Did you hear that?
Finn:::Yeah. Change of plans—I'll go take care of those chips. You keep the cookie distracted.
Jake:::Yeah. I can do that.
Finn:::Okay, awesome.
Jake:::Milk? Milk?Milk?Some milk?
Cookie:::What? Oh. Look, you should probably split, buddy. Things are about to get pretty flipped out in here.
Jake:::Oh, sure. Sorry, man. I was just trying to get away from that rotten Princess Bubblegum for a while, y'know? Isn't she just the worst?
Cookie:::Wait, you hate Princess Bubblegum, too? Get outta here!
Jake:::Oh, yeah, man, she's the worst. Sittin' out there all safe and cozy while I'm riskin' my life tootin' around in here in this stupid milkman costume.
Cookie::: Wait—costume?!
Jake:::Oh, um... I just mean it feels like a costume... 'cause I wanted to be a mailman so bad, ya see? But the princess—she made me be a milkman anyway.
Cookie:::Boy, I hear ya, brother.
Chipolina::: Cookie, you there? Over.
Cookie:::Yeah. Go ahead, Chipolina. Over.
Chipolina:::I just saw a light go on in the stock room—probably nothing. I'll check it out. Over.
Cookie:::Okay. Over.
Chipolina:::Hmm.Looks like a false alarm, Cookie. It's just some kid's Baby Snuggleghost nightlight. Hee-yah! 
Finn::: Alvin's hot juice box! Alvin's hot juice— 
Jake:::So what's your story, man? How'd she doodie on you?
Cookie::: I was just a kid, man, just a little kid, when I got doodied on.
Cookie :::I was the new guy at the Candy Orphanage. They called me Baby Snaps. I tried to make friends with the other kids...
Baby Snaps::: C'mon, guys, let's dance it up!
Cookie:::They were always too depressed to play.
Candy Child:::No, no. We're too depressed.
Cookie:::Things went on like that for a while, then... one day...she showed up.Everything was different.
Princess Bubblegum:::...a thunderous cheeras Baby Whoozlefut...
Cookie:::Everything was-was better with her around. And something inside me changed that day, too. And then later she told me I could be anything I wanted.
Princess Bubblegum:::Anything your sweet heart desires!
Cookie:::And I told her I wanted to be a princess like her, so I could make all the children happy.
Baby Snaps::: I wanna be a princess like you!
Cookie:::And she laughed in my face, man! It really messed me up.
Jake:::Holy shmow, man. That's terrible. That's really terrible. Listen, I—
Cookie::: She LIED to me!
Jake:::Yeah, but, maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to you.
Cookie::: No, she just wants to hog all the princessin' for herself!All chips, report in. It's time to get real! Over.Chips. Chips. Over.Chips! Where are my chips?! Chipolina! Chipler! Chipton! Chipper! Is anyone there?! Chipface? Something happened to my chips!AAAAH!I'm about to flip out, man... and take that crown!
Jake:::Whoa, whoa, wait! It doesn't have to be like this! You don't need that crown. You could start over, man. You can start a new kingdom—your own kingdom... where everyone can be whatever they wanna be. I can be the mailman... and you? You can be the princess. And—
Cookie:::My own kingdom?
Jake:::Yeah, man.
Cookie:::I... I'd like that.
Jake:::Okay, then. Just sit tight, Princess. I'll get us outta here.Hey! Hey! I'm comin' out!
Princess Bubblegum:::What?
Princess Bubblegum:::Jake? Jake, what's going on? Where's Finn? Where are the hostages?
Jake:::Don't worry, Princess. It's okay now. Princess Cookie's gonna go away. You just gotta give him a horse to escape with and he'll go.
Princess Bubblegum:::Right... and then you and Finn hunt him down and put him in the dungeon.
Jake:::No, wait. He said he'd go away forever. Can't we just let him go?
Princess Bubblegum:::No. That cookie is a menace. Once the hostages are safe, Cookie goes in my dungeon—in my dungeon for his life.
Cookie:::Oh, boy! Would ya look at that?
Cookie:::Dang!
Princess Bubblegum:::Okay, well... she's all yours!
Cookie:::Hot diggity! 
Jake::: Ah-ah-ah! Man, that horse ain't no good; that's a trap horse.
Cookie:::What are we gonna do?
Jake:::It's okay, man, I'm Jake. J-J-J-Jingo Jango! 
Cookie:::Whoa! Ha HA! You're magic!
Princess Bubblegum:::After them!
Cookie::: We're really doing it!
Finn:::Jake! What are you doing?! What happened to the plan?
Jake:::New plan—I'm gonna help Princess Cookie escape.
Finn:::What? But-but he's a criminal!
Jake:::No, man, Princess Cookie's a good guy. He just got dealt a bad hand. He's only trying to be what following how his dreams make you want to be, man!
Finn:::Whaaaat?
Jake:::You're either with us or against us.
Finn:::Um... 'gainst?WAAAH! Oof.
Jake:::Hold on tight, Cookie! I'm gonna jump the gorge!
Cookie:::No, Jake. Stop the horse.
Jake::: I can make it!
Jake:::Princess Cookie! Are you all right?
Cookie:::I'm done for, Jake.
Jake:::No, everything's gonna be fine. I won't let them put you in the dungeon. Just let me talk to them. 
Cookie:::No, Jake.
Cookie:::Thank you for your help, but it's too late for me. 
Cookie:::I'll never be a princess. At least for a moment, you helped me feel like a princess. It was wonderful.Thank you, Jake.
Jake:::Careful, Princess!
Cookie:::You know what? It's funny, but you sort of remind me of a mailman I used to know.
Jake::: I do?
Cookie:::Yep. 
Jake::: Princess!
Cookie:::I glubbed up!
Cookie:::Knight to E-5.
Jake::: Where's Baby Snaps?
Jake::: Excuse, me! Your highness!
Cookie::: Jake!
Jake:::Oh, hey. Check it out!Special delivery from the Grass Kingdom!
Various Patients:::He's a princess? I had no idea. Royalty!
