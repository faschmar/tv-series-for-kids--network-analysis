Finn:::He's heading for that cube. Come on, Jake.
Jake::: Oh, yeah.
Finn::: Whaaaat?!?! He's gone!
Jake::: What?! What happened?!
Prismo::: Hey, hey! Did you guys see that? You know that was a ghost wearing a dead guy? That might be the nastiest thing I've ever seen. Na-na-na-na-nasty! Nasty jazz! Nast-- 
Jake::: Hey, hey! Easy, buddy! That's our friend Billy! He got possessed by the Lich! 
Prismo::: Oh! Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean nothin' by it! I mean, I have a lot of nasty friends. My uncle is nasty. I'm basically honorary nasty.
Finn:::Do you know where he went? We have to find our friend.
Prismo::: Who knows?
Finn:::Uh. Oh.
Prismo::: Actually, it depends on the wish I granted him.
Finn::: "Wish"? 
Prismo::: Yeah, he wished for the extinction of all life and I did it. I guess it changed his timeline or something?
Finn::: WHAT?!?! OH GLOB!
Jake::: Whoa, wait a minute. How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn?
Prismo::: Oh, that's because you're safe in my time room until you make your wish.
Finn & Jake:::Ohhhh.
Jake::: I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc—
Finn:::Whoa! Wait, Jake. Don't mess this up. Think about it::: if we wish everything back to normal, the Lich could just jazz it up again.
Jake::: Oh yeah. Jazz.
Finn::: Hmmmm. 
Jake::: Hmmmm.
Finn::: I got it! I wish... the Lich... never... even ever existed!
Farmworld Finn::: Mom? Mom, what's wrong?
Finn's mom:::Finn, I need you to do something for me. It's very important.I need you to take the mule into town and sell him for as much as you can.
Farmworld Finn::: What! Sell Bartram?But, I love Bartram. What the heck, Mom!
Finn's Mother::: Shhh! Finn please, just do as I say. 
Trami:::Got it?
Farmworld Finn:::Dad?
Trami::: I push you, you fall down. 
Farmworld Finn::: The Destiny Gang?
Finn's Mother::: Everything will be fine, Finn, I promise. Now just do as I say. 
Farmworld Finn:::I'm sorry, Bartram. I guess Dad must be in real trouble to be doin' this. But, I bet there's a lot o' fine folk lookin' to buy a good mule. Why, I bet I could even come visit sometimes. Won't that be swell, Bartram?Bartram? Dang it Bartram! Bar Bar!What the- Bar Bar, how'd ya get up there?Whoa!Jake, look! Golden crown! Unbelievable! We can sell it and keep Bartram! Bong, bong. 
Farmworld Marceline:::Hold it right there!
Farmworld Finn::: Who are you?!
Farmworld Marceline::: I'm a thousand years old and this is my crown!
Farmworld Finn::: Okay, okay! But, um, maybe I could just borrow it for a little while. 
Farmworld Marceline::: Noooo! No! Noo! This crown is magic. Bad, terrible magic. Too dangerous for mortal fingies like yours!One thousand years ago, my beloved friend Simon Petrikov gave his life to save this foolish, unworthy planet from annihilation.A frightful bomb was poised to bathe the land in mutagenic horror,but using his mastery of ice and snow, Simon froze the bomb in mid-flight only inches from the ground, where it remains to this very day.Today, ever ripe and ready to blow.But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished!
Farmworld Simon:::Little help?
Farmworld Marceline:::And the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy the entire earth was buried in ice for four hundred boring years. 
Farmworld Finn::: Uhh, none o' that is true, 'cause magic is fake. Daddy says the false prophets of old used cheap parlor tricks to control the people.And to get babes. Like 10 or 12 hot babes each.
Farmworld Marceline::: No! Magic is real!
Farmworld Finn::: Lady! You been down here too long! Why don't you, just let me- 
Farmworld Marceline::: Step off! Or I will use this!
Farmworld Finn::: Lady! Quit it with that thing! 
Farmworld Marceline::: I'm sorry. You must DIEEEE! 
Farmworld Finn::: WAAAAAAAAAAaaaaah… ooo… uuum… 
Farmworld Marceline::: Oh, man! This thing! Dang it! 
Farmworld Finn::: Go, Jake! 
Farmworld Marceline::: Aaah! Go back to the underworld, ya beast. 
Farmworld Finn::: Sorry, gotta save my dad! 
Farmworld Marceline::: Destroy the world more like it!Dummy. I give up.
Farmworld Simon::: The crown. Go get it.
Farmworld Marceline::: I know you're not really talking to me. I'm not crazy!
Farmworld Simon::: Get the crown! Go get it!
Farmworld Marceline::: 
Farmworld Simon::: Get the crown, Marceline! Go get it!
Farmworld Marceline::: I can't. My knees!
Farmworld Simon::: Oh, that's really disappointing I must say. I'm just—uh, whatever, you're really letting me down right now.
Farmworld Marceline::: Okay, alright. 
Farmworld Finn:::Cool crown! Who wants a cool crown? I found it on a dead magician dude!
Guy #1::: I'll take it!
Farmworld Finn::: Awesome! How much cash ya got?
Guy #1::: Ohhh, I'm poor. Uh, but what about I trade you for a personal concert at your house? I'll come over later and sing ya like, four songs. I mostly do covers, but I have originals too. Do you own any spoons?
Farmworld Finn::: No.
Tromo::: Let me see that! 
Farmworld Finn::: Hey!
Tromo::: Heh!
Farmworld Finn:::Wait, Destiny Gang. I gotta sell that to pay you guys!
Tromo::: Trami, what you think? Is it my style?
Trami::: Big Destiny will know. Yo, boss! 
Big Destiny::: Snap! Huh? What is this?Are you tellin' me what to wear, Trami?
Trami::: No, boss, you look good! 
Big Destiny::: You think I should reinvent my style and put a stupid thing on my head?!
Trami::: No, man! You tell us what to wear!
Big Destiny::: Otherwise you would dress like an idiot! Bam! Crown shorts! 
Trami & Tromo::: Amazing! 
Big Destiny::: Yeah-ha-ha!
Tromo::: Clap harder, trash bag! 
Farmworld Finn::: Okay, you guys. Gimme my money and leave my parents alone.
Tromo::: Property of old dead person go to Big Destiny.One-arm needs to learn the rules, unless you want your butt handed to you.
Farmworld Finn::: I guess it wasn't really mine.
Farmworld Marceline:::It's mine! I'm a demon... half-demon.
Big Destiny::: Tromo! Jack up crazy lady! Trami! Take mule back to crib for din-din.
Farmworld Finn::: Whaat!Bar Bar!
Trami::: Tough luck, One-arm! 
Big Destiny::: See you soon, bad-style Junktown! 
Farmworld Finn::: Bar Bar. 
Tromo::: End of the road, bat lady! 
Farmworld Marceline::: Oh, my bones!
Tromo::: Haha! Ah!My eye! I will junk your face! What the! 
Choose Bruce::: Destiny gang, get outta town! We're sick of bein' bullied around! 
Tromo::: You make biiig mistake! Especially you, One-arm! 
Farmworld Finn::: My name is Finn Mertens! And tell big D I'm comin' for my stuff!
Tromo::: Ohhh, you come n' try!
Farmworld Finn::: Are you okay, lady?
Farmworld Marceline::: You must promise to—promise to return the crown to its hide-hole.
Farmworld Finn::: I promise.
Choose Bruce::: You'll need this Finn if you want to win.

Finn's Mother::: Nooo! 
Finn's Father::: Fiiinn!
Farmworld Finn::: Mom! Dad!You said this thing is magic?
Farmworld Marceline::: Yes. Powerful and dangerous.
Farmworld Finn::: But you lost your mind in a cave.
Farmworld Marceline::: Whatever. You just gotta believe me, okay? For serious, ya donk.
