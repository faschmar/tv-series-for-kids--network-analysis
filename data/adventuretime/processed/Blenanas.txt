Finn:::"B.R.B. - Jake". Hmm. B.R.B... B.R.B. Bring regular babies. Big red balls. No. Beautiful rump burger.
BMO:::What you doing, Finn?
Finn:::Jake left me this note, but I, uhI can't remem what the abbreve means.
BMO::: It's for me! This is Jake's special code to tell me he loves me.
Finn:::No, it's something normal like, uh...
BMO:::Be right back. 
Finn:::Right! "Be right back!"So dumb. Cool. Jake'll be right back.
BMO:::Look, Finn! My Jake Valentines. He leaves them for me when he goes out.
Finn:::That's cute, BMO.
BMO:::Yeah, I know.
Finn:::Oh, Ble. I love Ble!I'll read some Ble 'til Jake gets back, I guess.
Finn::: "What's your favorite food?" "Anything! As long as it's made of cheese!"Aw, man, these comics are like if someone put my soul on a page.Hmm? "You write the caption." Okay! Hmm."Ouch! Hey, this isn't helping."Yeah.Ja - I mean, BMO!
Finn:::Check this funny caption I just wrote.
BMO:::Hmm.No humor detected.
Finn:::What? No, it's - it's like... this guy's problem is a tiger biting his foot, and talking to this guy isn't helping! Like, "Ouch! Hey, this isn't helping!" You know, like, it's, you know, like...
BMO:::Was the tiger already biting his foot? Or did the tiger bite his foot after he lay down on the couch? Because that is the bearded man's responsibility.
Finn:::BMO, I love you, but you don't understand comedy.
BMO:::Maybe it's just not funny.
Finn::: This is funny, and I'm gonna prove it!
BMO:::You are?
Finn:::Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty bored, and this is really funny, BMO.
BMO::: Prove it!
Finn::: Fine! I'm going to!
BMO:::Fine!I'll be right here!
Finn:::Fine!
BMO:::Fine!
Princess Bubblegum:::Bwee-woo-bwee-woo! This is a drill!I repeat, this is a drill! 
Candy people:::Oh no! A real drill?!
Princess Bubblegum:::You two, raise your resinous glaze shields! 
Candy people:::Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Princess Bubblegum:::Activate the B.H.T. to preserve freshness!
Princess Bubblegum:::We're not ready.
Candy people:::Intruder! Intruder! It's our friend, Finn!
Finn:::What's all the hubbub, Bubs?
Princess Bubblegum:::Oh, just some precautionary exercises in case our primary alarm and defense system fails.
Finn:::Cool. Cool. Hey, can you look at this funny thing I wrote?
Princess Bubblegum:::Oh, sure! I'm fascinated by humor.Hmm! Yes. Certainly what this hirsute gentleman needs is a tetanus shot. Excellent point, Finn.
Finn:::No, but... is it funny? Never mind.
Princess Bubblegum:::I don't have time to explain the psychology of humor to you.But I'd like you to read this book.
Kenneth::: Hey, what do you think you're - Oh! Princess Bubblegum!Thank you, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum:::Der Witz Und Seine Beziehung Zum Unterbewussten. "The Joke and his Relation to the Unconscious". It's printed in Gebrochene Schrift, which I think is easier on the eyes.
Finn:::"Der Witz Und... Der Witz Und... See-einy... Bezeyhung... Zumbewuzzzz..." Ugh! PB's too smart. That's why she doesn't get my joke. I mean... it's funny.It's funny. "Ouch, hey this isn't-""This isn't helping."Uh, it's super funny. Turbo-nerds like PB just aren't the right audience for this sort of thing, you know? I should show this to normal people, the common folk. The busy woman on the go. The regular Joe or Josephine. Or somebody like Ice King, who's desperate for my approval.
Ice King::: Finn, this is so funny! A kitty with big teeth?! Come on!
Finn::: Yeah, I didn't draw that, but cool. Well, thanks for-
Ice King:::Oh, yeah. But, uh, what if - and I'm just spitballin'. What if it was something more like, "Hey, Doc! I got a caveman in my teeth!" Huh?
Ice King:::Haha! Whoo!
Finn:::Heh. Yeah. That's pretty good, I guess.
Ice King:::Oh, is this Ble? I love Ble! That one with the two cops who are always accidentally arresting each other.
Finn:::Right?! And "Animal Quackers"!
Ice King:::I've been mailing them my short stories and comics for as long as I can remember. But, uh, nary a piece published. Nary a piece.Nary a piece! I hate Ble! Sittin' in their ivory towers! They don't know comedy! They don't understand the common folk! The busy woman on the go!
Ice King and Finn::: The average Joe or Josephine! Right!
Ice King:::See? We got the goods, you and I, and they've lost their touch. Hey, if we want them to touch our goods, we should go down there and confront them face-to-face.
Finn:::And if I get my winning caption printed, everybody will know it's funny! I'm talking about you, BMO. But, uh, where do they print Ble?
Ice King:::Oh, yeah. I don't, uh... Oh! Oh! Yeah, hold this. I'll use my... demonic wishing eye!
Wishy:::Hello, Ice King.
Ice King:::Hello, Wishy!
Wishy:::What do you like to wish for?
Ice King:::I wish to go to Ble!
Wishy:::You go, girl!
Finn:::Whoa. Why don't you just use that thing all the time?
Ice King:::Oh, it takes a piece of your soul each time you use it. But look! The legendary Bledquarters!
Finn:::It must be so fun to work here, just sittin' around, making up jokes all day.
Pudding Troll:::Hey! Hey.
Finn:::Aww. Who are you?
Pudding Troll:::I'm a pudding troll, and I guard this humor magazine.
Finn:::Uhhhh, why?
Pudding Troll:::It's... my job.
Finn:::Why is this your job?
Pudding Troll:::I... applied? I'm maybe not following you. I think I better escort you off the premises.
Finn:::No! No, no, no. We just want to pitch a cartoon caption!
Pudding Troll::: Hey, Big Tina, it's your time to shine, okay?
Finn:::Waahh!
Finn:::Okay, what's our plan here?
Ice King:::Maybe if we eat all this ammo, he'll be forced to make more for us.
Finn:::Wait. You can fly!
Pudding Troll:::Uh-oh! Angle up, Big Tina!
Pudding Troll:::Uh-oh! Ugh!
Pudding Troll:::You win. Fine. I've never let anyone inside before, so I hope you have an amazing pitch.
Ice King:::Hey! These are all my submissions! They kept them in a big pile by the door... Seems like a good sign!
Finn:::Well, shoot, man. Looks like everyone here is crazy dead.
Pudding Troll:::I've been guarding dead people for five hundred years. Wow, I need to sit with that.
Finn:::This means that Ble Magazine is dead, too!Now how am I supposed to prove my caption's funny.
Ice King:::Ding dong! I found Ble 217! We can see what the winning caption was.
Finn::: "I'm going to write you a prescription for one giant club." 
Ice King:::It's about time us young guns took the reins.
Ice King:::Hello, boys. Now let's roll these presses one last time.
Finn:::Our very own Ble Magazine.
Ice King:::And it's a pretty good issue, too. We got that nice cover you did, my short story, "Fionna and Cake::: Baby Detectives", some, looks like, pudding jokes...
Pudding Troll:::Big Tina wrote those!
Ice King:::..."Fionna and Cake::: Baby Detectives Go to College", and, of course, your caption!
Finn:::Wow. It looks amazing in print.
Pudding Troll:::Guys, I'm gonna be honest, just speaking as an average Josephine, I really don't get that caption.
Finn:::Maybe it doesn't matter if my caption is funny or not. I think I just wanted to be part of Ble. It's something I've been a fan of for so long. And maybe we can bring it back. There's no reason it can't have a new dawn. A Blennaissance!
Ice King:::Okay, boys, close her down!
Finn::: No, you're right. Can't be nostalgic!
Finn:::Man, that caption was amazing in my head. Maybe I'm not a very funny person. Like, I got low comedy stats. That's kind of a bummer.
Finn:::Yo, BMO. Check it out! I got Ble to publish my caption, even though I don't need you to think I'm funny anymo-
