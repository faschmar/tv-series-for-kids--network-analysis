Finn::: Well, looks like your new house is done.Whoop! Jake! You wanna check out the new house?
Jake::: Naah,don't let me interrupt you. You two have fun.
Flame Princess:::I wanna see inside!I love it! 
Finn::: Great!This doesn't hurt as bad as it used to.Oh gob! Oh gob! Oh gob! 
Jake:::Finn!
Finn::: Haha, I'm okay!
Flame Princess:::Hmmmm...
Finn::: 
Flame Princess::: Oh!Do the thing that I like.
Flame Princess::: 
Jake:::Now do the thing I like.
Jake::: Hehehe, classic.Alright Finn, that's enough. 
Flame Princess::: Thank you for building my new home, Finn. I'm so happy.
Finn:::You... wanna hug?
Flame Princess::: Yes.
Jake::: Woah! Hold on "mama."
Jake:::Okay bro, tin foil's on. You can hug now.
Jake::: 
Finn::: Bye.
Flame Princess:::Bye, Finn.
Finn:::Bye! 
Flame Princess::: 
Jake::: Looks like your date went pretty good buddy.
Finn::: Uh... I don't know, was the hug okay? Give me some tips man.
Jake::: Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look, look , let me explain some junk about dating. Right now, , you're at Tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon,you'll be at Tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road , you'll make it to Tier 5, where she'll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong, beautiful stomach. Then after awhile, you'll make it to Tier 8 , where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special.
Finn:::What about Tier 15?
Jake:::You stay away from that! Do not do Tier 15!
Finn:::Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about.
Jake:::Don't worry about it dude, just let things naturally move to Tier 2. Oh and um, you need a shower dude.
Finn::: What?!  Oh gross.
Finn::: Do you think Flame Princess could smell me?
Jake::: Probably.
Finn::: Crup.
Princess Bubblegum:::'Sup, guys?
Finn and Jake::: Princess Bubblegum?!
Jake::: What are you doing here?
Princess Bubblegum::: Collecting taxes, you guys weren't home. So I let myself in.
Jake::: Oh.
Finn::: I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale!
Princess Bubblegum::: What? Why?
Finn::: Just don't.Hyap!
Princess Bubblegum::: What's that all about?
Jake::: Aah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady-friend.
Princess Bubblegum:::Ooh, a lady-friend, do tell.
Jake::: Uh, I shouldn't say. It's his business.
Princess Bubblegum:::Oh, come on, you can tell me.
Jake::: That's his personal biz, you gotta respect the man's p-biz.
Princess Bubblegum::: Okay, you're right, I'll respect it.
Jake::: Flame Princess! He's hanging out with Flame Princess!
Princess Bubblegum:::What?!
Jake::: And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school. But pretty soon,they're gonna be taking it to Tier 2.
Princess Bubblegum::: No, this isn't possible.
Jake::: Oh, it's possible.
Princess Bubblegum::: I just never thought, Flame Princess. I-uh-I have to go.
Princess Bubblegum::: Morrow!
Morrow::: 
Jake:::  Mmm, weird.
BMO:::Guess who's late for their video chat. 
Jake:::President Porpoise!
President Porpoise::: 
Princess Bubblegum:::No, no.Oh gob, I thought I'd be ready for this.
Finn::: Yyyaawn!Whoop. Jake, I'm going to see Flame Princess, be back later. 
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn!
Finn::: 
Jake::: Ok Princess, you need to stop breaking in here.
Princess Bubblegum::: I have something important to tell you. About relationships.
Finn::: Ah, that's okay, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum::: I just hope, you'll understand.Relationshipsare like layers of sedimentary rock.......
Finn::: Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me. I'm gonna bounce out.
Jake::: Uh, ok,Tier 2 baby!
Finn::: Word. 
Princess Bubblegum::: If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt causing a catastrophic super-stratum of igneous rock to form......
Jake::: What? Where am I?
Mini-snowman::: Jake, you're president now!
Jake::: Oh my glosh! 
Princess Bubblegum::: Jake!
Jake::: 
Princess Bubblegum::: Wake up!
Jake::: 
Princess Bubblegum::: Jake, where's Finn?
Jake::: He stepped out.
Princess Bubblegum::: Will you tell him why he can't see Flame Princess anymore?
Jake::: Oh, oh!I see what's going on here!
Princess Bubblegum::: Great! I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other. 
Jake::: Oh man, PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess!
BMO:::Jump, punch, kick, kick!
Jake::: What's up man?
Finn::: Yo, dude! So what did Princess Bubblegum want?
Jake::: She doesn't want you see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous!
Finn::: 
Jake::: So, you at Tier 2 yet?
Finn:::I got about five hugs, does that count?
Jake::: Nnoope.
Finn:::Uhaah.. Well, I'm still at Tier 1.
Jake::: I know exactly what'll get you Tier 2.... A "sappy poem." 
Jake::: Say something about her "spectrum."
Finn::: Ee-eww! Let's see.... She's bright. She's beautiful. She makes me feel... confused, l-like something's filling up my chest, like I can't breathe, is it because she's so.. dangerous? Glob, Jake, I can't stand it! 
Jake::: 
Finn::: Inspiration... 
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn!
Finn::: 
Princess Bubblegum::: Whatcha doin'?
Finn::: Oh, uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uhh, writing something for Jake.
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh, well, speaking of Jake. Did he explain everything to you?
Finn::: Yyeah.
Princess Bubblegum::: And you understand?
Finn:::Yeah, I understand.
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn, sometimes you want someone and youwant to kiss them, and be with them. But you can't, because responsibility demands sacrifice.
Finn:::What are you trying to say?!
Princess Bubblegum::: I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess.
Finn:::Grr... Bubblegum! I can't do this anymore!
Princess Bubblegum::: What?
Finn::: Now you like me?!
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn, what are you talking about?
Finn::: What am I talking about?!PB, I was.... geh...eh..I was in love with you! Okay?! And you didn't love me back! Now I'm ready to move on, and it's like...rrmph!! You're gonna build me up all over again! Well, I'm done! I'm done. 
Princess Bubblegum:::Oh, no!
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn! Jake, where's Finn? Is he with Flame Princess?
Jake:::Back off, Bubblegum! That's his "man's biz."
Princess Bubblegum::: Is he with her?!Or not?!
Jake:::You heartless monster! Do you have any idea how much he's CRIED OVER YOU? Finn deserves to be happy, even if his blooping face gets burned off!You should beashamed!You're SICK! 
Princess Bubblegum::: What are you..? This isn't about somepetty love triangle! Flame Princess is physically unstable!Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance! Glob, if Finn tries to kiss her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core, then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside! Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?!
Jake::: 
Princess Bubblegum::: Will you take me to them?
Princess Bubblegum::: Faster!
Finn:::Your wavelengths are my weakness, your emissions are what I've been missing. 
Finn and Flame Princess::: 
Flame Princess::: Ahhh.
Princess Bubblegum::: No!
Finn:::Ohhhh-uh, Flame Princess! 
Finn::: FLAME PRINCESS!
Jake:::Finn!
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn, there's no time! You have to...
Jake::: Are you alright?
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn!
Jake::: 
Finn:::Ohhh-tsst. Flame Princess!
Jake:::It's hot!
Princess Bubblegum::: Wait, wait! Don't move. This is good! If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen.She'll go out.
Jake:::Geh.. What about Finn?
Finn::: Hey!What's wrong? Please, say something.Please...I need you...to be okay. 
Flame Princess::: Huh, ummm. 
Finn:::Are you okay?
Flame Princess::: I'm okay. I'm okay.
Princess Bubblegum:::She's stabilized. We're safe... for now.
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh, Finn.
Jake::: 
Princess Bubblegum:::What?
Jake:::Jeeeaalous?
Princess Bubblegum::: Shut up.
