Jake::: Ommmmm... 
Finn:::Jake! What am I supposed to be meditatin' about?
Jake:::Don't know. I'm thinking of pillows stuffed with spaghetti.
Princess Bubblegum::: Clear your minds.
Princess Bubblegum::: I have to go check on something!
Finn::: Can we go with?
Princess Bubblegum::: ...Perhaps you are ready to go with.Guys, you'll need to put these on.Pull back your hat.
Jake::: Neat!
Princess Bubblegum::: Stay close to me. 
Finn::: Whoa!
Princess Bubblegum::: At the heart of this tree is an ancient evil, held in a prison of amber—the Lich.
Finn::: What's that sound?
Princess Bubblegum::: He's casting spells—trying to get in your head and control your bod... but these gems are protecting our minds from his influence. If we lost the gems, we'd be defenseless.He would have full control over us.
Finn::: That's freakin' nuts!
Princess Bubblegum::: Beyond Iceberg Lake lies the ruins of the Lich's tower, where he was converting the planet's life force into unholy power to destroy all of Ooo... but before he could, the Legendary Billy attacked him and pummeled him into the resin of this tree.I—WHAT THE NUTS?!
Finn::: Dude, be a big sword!
Jake::: Oh, okay! I'll try!
Princess Bubblegum:::Quickly! To the other secret room!There's only one known weapon that can harm the Lich.The Gauntlet of the Hero.
Voice::: BIIILLYYYYYYY!!!
Jake::: Billy's big ol' beef fingers!
Princess Bubblegum::: Finn, you have but one chance. While the Lich isn't at full power, you must smite him with this gauntlet!His only desire... is to destroy life. If you fail... he'll kill everyone.
Finn::: No. That will not happen.
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh, and there's something else that I want you to have. The Lich's lair is supposed to be cold. ...I just don't want you to get sick.Take this sweater. I made it myself.I'm not great at knitting, but please wear it. I care about you, Finn.
Finn::: I love it.
Jake::: Me, too!
Ice King:::Hey hey hey!So... I've been thinking about this a lot lately and, well, uh... phew, gosh, I'm so nervous... Finn, and Jake, will you give me your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum?
Jake::: What is wrong with you?!
Ice King:::What's wrong with me?!No!Not the latch!
Princess Bubblegum::: Quickly now, Finn! Track the Lich by his trail of death.
Finn::: Here I go!
Jake::: Here I go!
Princess Bubblegum::: Be safe!
Jake::: This is our first fate-of-the-world deal!
Finn::: Yeah, man! We gotta shut this fool down hardcore!
Jake::: Running this fast makes my stomach hurt!
Finn::: Run through it, man!We gotta get beyond Iceberg Lake before the Lich!
Ice King::: Oh, my! How clumsy of me!
Finn::: What the heck, Ice King?!
Ice King::: Hey, wait, you guys! I'm serious about Bubblegum! Look, I wrote her name all over my arms and legs! 
Finn and Jake::: Yugh!
Ice King::: Guys! It's not fair! She always hangs out with you, and it's not like you wanna marry her!
Finn:::Why are you following us?! 
Ice King::: Whoa!I told you already. I want your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum!Come on, guys, give me permission to marry her! I'll... I'll do a little dance for you!Hmm? You like this?
Finn::: No!
Ice King:::Oh, come on! If you bless our wedding, then maybe she'll really love me.
Finn:::Ice King, go away, man.
Ice King::: I will! When you bless our wedding!
Finn::: No thanks, guy. Hmm? How does this gauntletwork?!
Jake::: Whoa!
Finn::: I can't turn it off!
Jake::: Punch it in the eye!
Finn::: Phew!
Jake::: Let's blow this stand!
Ice King:::I tried to do this right, but you've driven me to this—driven me to bad doing.
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh, Finn and Jake, please be okay.Please be okay... please be okay...
Ice King::: Eh... stupid thing... come on... eh...
Princess Bubblegum::: Ice King?! Get outta here!!
Ice King::: I didn't want to do this, but by not blessing our wedding, Finn and Jake have forced me to kidnap you.
Princess Bubblegum::: That's insane!
Ice King::: I know! But I'll show them... I'll show them how they've hurt us!
Princess Bubblegum:::NO!!
Jake::: There! Out over the lake!
Finn::: After his butt!
Jake:::I'm your dingy dog!
Finn::: Here! I'll help paddle!Hey. It's me.Aw, come on. I'm sorry I punched you in the ball.

Ice King::: Oh, no.Oh, gross. This water stinks.
Finn:::ICE KING!!
Ice King::: Look! Look what you've made me do to her!
Princess Bubblegum::: Guys! Don't let the Lich reach his well of power!Oh, no!! He's made it!!
Finn::: Don't worry, Princess!
Ice King::: Hey, where're you guys goin'? What's goin' on?
Finn::: I don't have time for this!
Jake::: Then let's go!
