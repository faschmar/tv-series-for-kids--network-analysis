Head Clown Nurse::: Who wants a cookie?Milk-dipped chocolate chip cookie?
Finn::: No thanks.
Head Clown Nurse::: Now, come on, Finn. You have to eat. Open Sesame...
Finn::: Uh, Jake, can't we get rid of these Clown Nurses? They make me feel ridiculous.
Jake::: No way, man.
Jake::: Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds.I paid them up front. They don't leave until the job's done. Besides...They're funny.Look, she just farted.
Head Clown Nurse::: Time for our love therapy.
Finn::: Wait, what are they doing?Whoa! Stop!
Head Clown Nurse:::Oh my! Did that hurt, dear?
Finn::: NO!! I just don't want you kissing my toe!
Head Clown Nurse::: Now, now, honey, you gotta understand. This is the only way to "foo-foo" your boo-boo.
Finn::: What does that even mean??
Jake::: I don't know... but I'm feeling better already. Ah. That tickles.
Big Clown Nurse::: You want me to stop?
Jake::: No, keep going. 
Finn:::You're gross, man.Look! Deep in the forest of trees, there's a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound. See? See?
Head Clown Nurse::: Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals, and my professional prescription is... your toe needs crazy smooches! It's the only way! 
Finn::: Huh? Wha?
Finn::: Wait! Wait! Wait! There's another way! There's my way! Let me show you my way!
Finn::: Ahh! Let me go! 
Head Clown Nurse::: It's the only way! 
Head Clown Nurse:::It's the only way!
Finn::: MY WAY!!
Finn::: Hmmm...
Tree Stump::: Ring, ring! Look, there's only two choices, bro. Take your pick. There's the path on the left, Hair Fall-Out Path. No more hair again, ever! Or the path on the right, Smelly Path. Makes you smelly forever. Hoohoo, you won't believe it.
Finn::: Isn't there another way?
Tree Stump::: Nope.
Finn::: But what if I just went—
Tree Stump::: No, that's it! You have to choose! There's no other way! Choosing is the only way. Choosing—is the only—way.
Head Clown Nurse::: It's the only way! 
Tree Stump::: Hey, listen man, the Smelly Path's not actually that bad!
Finn::: NO! I choose MY WAY!!My way.
Bush::: Ring ring. Hello, dummy police? Yes, there's a strange dummy lurking around my house. Okay, yes. Thank you. Goodbye.
Finn::: Wha...?I need to cross the river. The Cyclops is over there.
Bush::: You can't cross this river. It's impossible! Look! The current is so fast, it'll turn your butt inside-out for real, doofus. And the water's so acidic it'll crump your boat in half. It's like orange juice. It's gross. There's a bridge, but it's a trap! Plus, the water's jamming with electric eels. Wow, so weird. Anyway, that's it, there's no other way around, you dummy.
Finn::: But I need to get across.
Bush::: Listen what I'm telling you. There's no way. ...Ugly tramp.
Finn::: Glob, Glob it, Glob it, Glob it...
Bush::: Huh? What are you saying? "Globbit, Globbit"? Who's Globbit?
Finn::: MY WAY!!
Bush::: Glibby glob, man! You're crazy! We're not even half way across! You gotta go back, man! It's the only way, you ugly fat-smelling fat-head!
Finn::: NO, MY WAY!! 
Finn:::MY WAY!Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob.
Pan::: Uhh, excuse me, friend.You're pretty tall, can you reach up there and get my wheel for me? Gotta get these melons home to my wife. You know how it is.
Finn:::MY WAY! 
Pan::: Watch out, Rainy!
Pan:::Rainy!
Finn::: Whoops. Uh... man, I'm real sorry.
Pan::: Yeah?No doy... friend.
Finn::: But... I can still help. I'll fix your house for you.
Pan::: Just get out of here! Leave us alone!
Finn::: Uh... wh... I... 
Pan::: Psycho fink.
Finn:::I was wrong. Was I wrong? No. Yes... Yes... I was wrong. How could it be? I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts. I was wrong. How could it be? Listened to my brain, but ended up insane. The melons rolled...over that lady. I went too far. How could it be?How did I go... too far? 
Forest Cyclops::: Hey! I know you're here for my magical tears, but you won't have any, because I never cry.
Finn::: I don't want 'em anymore.
Forest Cyclops::: What? Stop lying. You're here for my tears, aren't you?
Finn::: No. I hurt a small, hairy man's wife. I just wanna go home.
Forest Cyclops::: You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry... but I've got a heart of stone, buddy. I'm EVIL!
Finn::: Dude! What's wrong with you? I said I don't want your tears!
Forest Cyclops::: YOU'RE LYING!
Finn::: I'M NOT LYING!!!
Forest Cyclops:::You stink at lying.
Finn::: Fine. Whatever, man. Have it your way.
Forest Cyclops::: Okay... I WILL HAVE IT MY WAY!!
Finn::: Huh? 
Forest Cyclops::: Beg for mercy, or I'll kill you!
Finn::: 
Forest Cyclops::: Whuh... What?
Finn::: 
Forest Cyclops::: What? I can't hear you.
Finn::: I said... MY WAY!!
Finn::: Magical tear drops.My way can still work! Yeah!
Rainy::: Huh? I'm okay.
Pan::: Yay!
Bush::: Huh?Whoa!
Tree Stump::: Huh? Whoo-hoo.
Ham Sandwich::: Yeah!
Jake::: Oh, yeah. Huh?
Head Clown Nurse::: Have you come crying back for your proper treatment, Babylips?
Finn::: Kiss that!
Head Clown Nurse::: Oh, my! You look horribly injured! My kisses will make heal you.Now how does that feel?
Forest Cyclops::: Bittersweet.
Finn::: Hey, man. You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo?
Jake::: Ah, no thanks. I think the kisses work better.Excuse me, don't stop, keep going, please. 
Finn::: You're gross.
Jake::: Hey! We all have our own ways.
Finn:::You know what? You're... right.
