Sweet P:::Vroom, vroom! Kshh! Vroom, vroom, vroom!
Tree Trunks::: Sweet P!
Tree Trunks:::Come and get it, Sweet P.
Sweet P:::Oh boy! Breakfast porridge.Mmm. I think I must have the most perfect life in the whole world.
Tree Trunks:::Oh, that's lovely.
Sweet P:::What about you, Mama? Is your life perfect?
Tree Trunks:::Me?Yes, Sweet P. I'm the happiest mama in the whole world.
Sweet P:::Oh no, mama! You're sad!
Tree Trunks:::No, no, sweetie. That's just something that happens when grown-ups think about their lives for too long.
Mr. Pig::: Honey, can you get that?
Mr. Pig:::Thanks, sweetie.
Tree Trunks::: Hello?
Randy::: Tree Trunks? Tree Trunks, it's me, Randy. Wow, it's so great to hear your voice.
Tree Trunks::: Randy?
Randy:::Forgive me for being so bold, but Tree Trunks, I must see you.
Tree Trunks:::I don't think that's a very good idea, Randy.
Randy:::Tree Trunks, please!
Tree Trunks:::Um, okay, hold on. 
Mr. Pig:::Who was that, sweetie?
Tree Trunks:::That was, uh, the school. There's a parent-teacher conference I need to go to.
Mr. Pig:::Really? Isn't it my turn this time?
Tree Trunks:::No, because, um... it's my turn...?
Mr. Pig:::Well, if you say so.
Tree Trunks:::Be back soon.
Mr. Pig::: Okay. Uh, bye.
Tree Trunks:::The future's wild.
Randy:::We did it, babe. We finally graduated high school.
Tree Trunks:::Yes, Randy, we did.
Cookie::: Tree Trunks, would you sign my yearbook?
Tree Trunks:::I sure will, Cookie. Do you want me to sign on my fencing photo, my Homecoming Queen photo, my horseback riding club photo-
Cookie::: Would you sign your swim team photo?
Tree Trunks:::Yes. That's my favorite. 
Randy:::When you get done with that kid stuff, let me know. I got grown-up stuff to discuss.
Tree Trunks:::I was about to say the same thing to you.Randy, I've decided to take some time for myself and see the world. I'm eighteen and I need adventure, Randy. I need-What?
Randy:::Baby...
Randy:::...let me be your adventure.
Tree Trunks:::Okay, why not?
Randy's father:::Kiss her, son!
Randy:::Our wedding photos are here. Just in time for the honeymoon. Babe?
Tree Trunks::: It's over, Randy. I'm a wild child.Goodbye.
Tree Trunks:::"Goodbye, Randy." 
Randy:::Okay.
Tree Trunks:::Hmm? Oh, Randy, I'm so sorry you went to all this trouble.
Randy:::Huh?
Tree Trunks:::I mean, I'm flattered, but I have a family now and I can't run away with you.
Randy:::That... Tree Trunks, that's not why I asked you here.
Tree Trunks:::It's not?
Randy:::No. I just wanted to ask you for my grandmother's ring back.
Tree Trunks:::Oh.
Randy:::I'm going to propose to my girlfriend this weekend. I've got the chocolates, and the flowers, but I need that ring.
Tree Trunks:::Well, I'm sorry, but I threw that ring down a bottomless pit.
Randy:::Oh no!
Tree Trunks:::No, wait, that's not right. I used that ring to propose to my second husband, Danny.
Randy:::Oh, no.
Tree Trunks::: Oh, Danny.
Tree Trunks::: At sea, I made a new life for myself.
Tree Trunks:::Mr. Faidutti.
Mr. Faidutti:::Yes, Captain Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks:::Mr. Faidutti, pick up that mop, you bug.
Tree Trunks::: Mm hmm.
Crew member:::Captain Tree Trunks, we're approaching a ship off the port bow!
Tree Trunks:::Good.Drown all but the tightest men.
Danny::: No!
Tree Trunks:::Impudence.
Danny:::I beg of you, madam, while I am tight, my brother is not, and yet I love him.
Tree Trunks:::Hmm.
Danny:::My name is Daniel Prince and this is my brother, Peanut. Please look into your heart and pity him, for though our family is quite wealthy, he has had a difficult life.You are a very beautiful elephant, but I fear your bandit ways have made you hard.
Tree Trunks::: He was right. I left my post that very day so that I could spend the rest of my life with Danny.
Tree Trunks::: That evening, we were wed.
Tree Trunks:::Peanut?
Danny::: Kiss my mouth, baby!
Tree Trunks:::Yeah!
Tree Trunks::: My joy, however, would be short-lived. Was Danny smooth? Yes.Was Danny tight? Yes.But was he a liar? Yes, yes, yes! 
Crew members:::Ah!Woop woop woop woop woop.
Tree Trunks::: A liar in cahoots with Mr. Faidutti to get me away from my ship.
Tree Trunks::: I marooned Danny, and I kaboomed Mr. Faidutti.
Tree Trunks:::No more tight men.
Tree Trunks:::That Danny was really, really, really something.
Randy:::Okay, I get it. But what about the ring? What happened next?
Tree Trunks:::I savvily invested my pirate treasure and became a powerful shipping magnate.
Tree Trunks:::Come in.
Wyatt:::Uh, I'm Wyatt, your new secretary. These flowers are from "Robot Body Moe".
Tree Trunks:::Oh, again? Throw those in the trash.
Wyatt:::Okay, ma'am.They're a little - a little big. Oh, boy.
Tree Trunks:::The other way, like a vase.
Tree Trunks::: He melted my heart.
Wyatt:::Hey-hey!
King of Ooo:::Somebody kiss me now!
Tree Trunks::: I sold the company and gave all my money to the King of Ooo.
Tree Trunks:::Swim with me, Wyatt, you sweet boy. 
Wyatt:::Oh, uh-
Tree Trunks::: I'm never wearing clothes again! 
Wyatt:::I, uh, might keep my shirt on.
Tree Trunks::: I thought Glob had told me, "Here's someone who needs your love." But what he really must've said was, "Go suck an egg, Tree Trunks."
Tree Trunks:::No more pie.
Wyatt:::But that's my pie.
Tree Trunks:::You're draining my life away.
Wyatt::: Take care of me!
Tree Trunks:::No. You've emptied me of my joie de vivre.
Wyatt::: I've got the ring! If I don't give it back, it means we're still in love!I'm throwing it in a bottomless pit!
Randy:::Wyatt threw my ring in a pit?
Tree Trunks:::Yeah, sorry about that. Uh- huh?
Tree Trunks:::Mr. Pig, what are you doing here?
Mr. Pig:::I followed you because I was afraid that - And now I see you-
Tree Trunks:::Oh, no.
Randy:::I just wanted my grandma's ring back.
Tree Trunks:::And I just didn't want you to worry over nothing.
Mr. Pig:::R-Really? Oh, geez.
Wyatt:::There you are!How could you, Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks:::Wyatt? You've been following me?
Wyatt:::You wish, babe. I've been following himto you! But if Tree Trunks is gonna be stepping out on her man with one of her exes, it's gonna be me!Tree Trunks, help me. I need you.
Randy::: My ring! Just give me...
Wyatt:::My suck-suck ring.
Randy:::Aha! Gotcha! 
Mr. Pig:::Um, I'm sorry I didn't trust you. I just know you've had a lot of adventures in the past and things are kind of boring now.
Tree Trunks:::It's true. I sometimes miss those wild times, but back then, I couldn't even tell the difference between a good adventure and a bad one. I was just a leaf in the wind, blown about by my whims. But now I'm on solid ground. You and Sweet P are my - uh-
Mr. Pig:::Your greatest adventure?
Tree Trunks:::Yeah.
Danny:::Whoa, what the..? Is that Wyatt? Tree Trunks?
Danny:::What the heck is going on in here?
