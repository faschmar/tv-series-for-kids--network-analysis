Bella Noche:::Have you obtained the staff of Stranson Doughblow?
Forest Wizard:::Yes, Bella Noche. We procured the staff using the full extent of our wizardy ways.
Bella Noche:::Then the time has come to reveal my true form, and when I materialize on this... 
Ice King::: Oh, this striz is going down, man.
Bella Noche:::...you will receive your end of the deal.
Laser Wizard:::The lost system of Antediluvian magick—the tightest of all wiz biz.
Forest Wizard:::So right and tight, I get restless leg syndrome about it. Look. 
Bella Noche:::And now, it will be yours.
Ice King:::And mine!
Forest Wizard:::What the blood?! Ice King!
Ice King:::Listen, dudes, all I want is to be in the club and plus up my magic. What's the problem?
Laser Wizard:::Your life is my problem.
Bella Noche:::Too late, fools! Bella Noche emerges!
Forest Wizard:::Whoa! What the—?
Grand Master Wizard:::Stop that now, trash cones! Bella Noche must not cross into our world!
Ice King:::Eh, why not, again?
Grand Master Wizard:::Duck!
Grand Master Wizard:::Aw, cram! Here we go!
Forest Wizard::: Uhhhh... hey. Hey, I—I can't feel my magic!
Laser Wizard:::Me neither. What gives?
Grand Master Wizard:::Bella Noche is a being of pure anti-magic! Y'alls got played!
Simon:::Uh, hello?
Forest Wizard:::Oh, what a fool am I!Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Grand Master Wizard::: Go! Destroy! Throw your boots at it, or—I don't know!
Simon:::Huh? 
Grand Master Wizard:::Dang. Sorry, Ice King.
Simon:::This must be it, man.I've crossed into some super-insane zone where I feel like I'm just normal again.Or maybe I'm just normal again.
Ash:::Hey, stop looking at yourself. You're ugly, bro. Get lost. This is my busking spot.
Simon::: Sorry, man. No time! Go, carpet!Whoa!It's got to be here. Even in my prolonged state of insanity, my immutable essence must have known to—oh, yes.Hello.Ah, my research. My jackie—jacket!Mutation, mutation, mind expa—aha!"Mystic Rituals And Their Space Time Applications" by Simon Petrikov and Betty Grof.Betty.Whoops. Marceline?
Marceline:::A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four.
Finn:::Wait!
Marceline:::What?
Finn:::Why are you holding your bass up high like that?
Marceline:::Mm-mm-mmm. (I don't know.) I get better finger action this way.
Finn:::But you look like a nerd. Move it back down. It's better.
Jake:::Move the bass down.
Finn:::A-move the bass a-down.
Jake:::Be reasonable.
Marceline::: Yes?
Simon:::Marcy, it's me, Simon. I'm back, but my body might donk out soon, so get to the Ice Kingdom fast and help me with this time portal so I can find Betty and say I'm sorry before I croakboat! I know that's a lot to process, but hurry, and bring Hambo. Hambo is the key.
Simon (over telephone):::Okay, Marcy? You got that? Marcy?
Marceline:::A long, long time ago, Simon was my only friend. He was there when I needed help.
Marceline::: All he ever wanted was to find Betty, and now I can help him.
Marceline:::Simon?
Gunter:::Wenk!Wenk!
Marceline:::Simon!
Simon:::Marceline!
Marceline:::I thought I'd never see you again.
Simon:::I can hardly believe it myself. You're all grown up.
Jake:::Believe! She's like a million years old!
Simon:::One million years? How could it be?!
Marceline:::He's just kidding. I'm only a thousand.
Jake:::And still looking good!
Finn:::Do you remember anything from when you were the Ice King?
Simon:::Nothing specific—just dreamlike impressions.
Finn:::Do you still have impressions from all the times we flipped your bricks?
Simon:::I have... bruises.Excuse me. I—
Marceline:::Man, Simon.
Simon:::I'm fine. 
Marceline:::You're dying!
Simon:::Well, yes, but only in increments. I've still got work to do. Finn and Jake, will you run my generator?
Finn:::Yeah, man.
Jake:::Cool.
Simon:::That's great! Keep pedaling! All we need now is the catalyst—an object from the past that has been lovingly tended to through the ages.
Marceline::: Goodbye, Hambo. 
Simon:::Because of you, I can say goodbye to Betty and tell her I'm sorry for driving her away. Thank you, Marceline. 
Simon (possessed)::: Where's my Betty? Where's my princess?! Princess! Princess!!
Betty:::Simon, don't leave me like this.
Simon:::Betty? Betty. Betty!
Betty:::Simon? What is going on?
Simon:::I'm a thousand years in the future, love. I opened this portal so we could say goodbye.
Betty:::You're dumping me?
Simon:::No! It's just that everything changed after I put on that crown. I—I went crazy. You ran away. I—I never saw you again.
Betty:::But where would I go without you?
Simon:::I'll never know.
Betty:::I don't understand. You don't seem crazy now. I mean, in the future.
Simon:::The portal is closing. There's no time to explain. Just know that I love you, and I forgive you for leaving me.
Betty:::Simon, I know who I'm leaving you for!
Simon:::Who?
Betty::: You, dum-dum! 
Betty:::Simon?What's wrong? Are you sick?
Simon:::No, I'm old. The crown was keeping me alive, but its magic was negated by the creature Bella Noche.
Betty:::Don't die, Simon. I just got here.
Simon:::Oh, I'm sorry, Betty.
Betty:::I know! I'll fix the crown, and then I'll figure out how to fix you!
Simon:::What? No. Guys, stop her.
Jake:::Uh...
Marceline:::Hmm...
Finn:::Yeah, but...
Jake:::It kind of sounds like a good idea.
Betty:::Right, whoever you are.I'm sorry. It's the only way. 
Simon:::No!
Betty::: Okay, rug, take me to Bella Noche.
Betty:::Get on, Simon!
Simon:::I am getting on... the death bus.
Death::: I've got you in my sights, Simon. 
Simon:::It's my time, Betty! I don't want to be the Ice King again. It's like living with eternal diaper butt. I can't do it!
Betty:::Not forever. Destroying Bella Noche and getting your power back will buy me time to find a loophole that'll undo your curse and your death. I can do it! You got to believe me, Simon.
Simon:::I...
Death:::Get real, man. You're gonna be the Ice King till the sun blows up. This is your one chance. I made a mix tape for the ride::: "Summer Jams 3"!
Simon:::If I don't let her try, then what am I? What am us?
Betty:::What?
Death:::Eh, fair enough. See you in a few. 
Grand Master Wizard:::This brioche won't stop growing.Ron James, what took...you?
Ron James:::Yo, my lab got creamed! I had to dummy-rig an alchemical filter out of a dirty bidet and a vaporizer!
Grand Master Wizard:::But will the double-negative magic work?
Ron James:::Heck yeah! Ron James always delivers! Check it out, brotha! Yaah!In your face!
Grand Master Wizard & Ron James:::Yeah!
Grand Master Wizard:::What the stink is that?!
Ron James:::My lab conditions were not ideal.
Grand Master Wizard:::But you did not deliver! 
Ron James:::Peace, man! Aaah!
Betty:::We're here to help!
Grand Master Wizard:::Help how?
Grand Master Wizard:::We're toast, bro.
Simon::: 
Betty:::Simon!
Betty:::Hey, don't scare me like that.
Simon:::Just hold my hand to your face. This will be my... last sensation.
Betty:::Don't be a wimp, Simon! Just give me a second! 
Death:::You got about 15 seconds.
Bella Noche:::How the—? Wait.
Betty:::Surprise!Tranch.
Death:::You lose, Simon. Sorry, man. 
Ice King:::Uh, huh?
Ice King:::This a party? Huh?
Grand Master Wizard:::Wizard City is saved!
Ice King:::Whoa! Heh. Okay. Whoopee!
Ice King:::So then, Ron James told me this girl I was with flew into Bella Noche and mysteriously defeated it for me! Wow! 
Ice King:::Just my luck, right? Black out for a day and meet the woman of your dreams.
Muscle Princess:::I will get you!
Ice King:::Hey, don't be jealous, Muscle Princess. She's gone—kablooey. Let's be realistic, right? We both know you're not my top pick.
Ice King:::Oh, Grod!
Ice King:::No!
Ice King:::Aaah! Go home! You can go! Aah!
