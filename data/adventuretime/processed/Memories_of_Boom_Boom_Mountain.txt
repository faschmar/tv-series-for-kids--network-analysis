Squid Bartender::: You guys sure you want another round of squid ink? 
Head Marauder:::You're not too bad for a human boy!
Finn::: Not too bad!? I'm better than that!Huh?Jake! Do you hear that?
Jake:::What'd you say? Whoa! 
Finn::: I think someone's crying.Stop!This is serious! I gotta go find out where that crying is coming from! 
Head Marauder ::: Get back here you chickeeeen!
Marauders::: Ohhhhhhhh! 
Finn:::What did you call me?
Head Marauder ::: You can't just walk away from a roughhouse!
Finn:::Hey! Listen up you cold-hearted marauders! Someone's out there crying for help and I'm not gonna ignore that!
Jake::: Awwww here it comes! Lay it down Finn!
Finn::: A long time ago when I was a baby, I went boom boom on a leaf. Boom! Boom!And I fell backwards and sat in my own boom boom. I cried for a day. But no one came to help me.That day I vowed to help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem.And that's why I need to go. 
Jake:::He still cries when he poops. Thanks for being cool guys. Wait up, Finn!It's comin' from up there!
Finn::: Someone must be caught in that avalanche! Let's get it on!So, who's crying?
Mountain Man::: I am.
Finn::: Whoa! Aww, what's wrong fella? You cryin' boulders?
Mountain Man::: Yes, I am sad. Having been forced to watch roughhousing men for centuries.
Finn::: Ohhhh! I see. You're feeling left out and you wanna roughhouse too! Well I can take you on tough guy! Come on Jake! Back me up! 
Jake::: Yeah, do it Finn! Hit 'im with a boulder! And then hit 'im with another rock!
Mountain Man::: Please! No roughhousing! It…m-makes…me…soooo.. SAD! 
Finn::: Huh? Why?
Mountain Man::: Because they're so rough on each other!
Finn:::But a smooth well controlled roughhouse bolsters your guts and rejuvenate the muscle.
Mountain Man::: No! It's raunchy and maddening! All those men and their disgusting fantastic bodies!
Jake::: Whoa. This guy's got problems.
Ladybug kid::: Look mommy! 
Ladybug Lady::: Honey! Don't look! That kid's got problems! 
Finn::: I'll help you mountain!
Jake::: Whoa! What?
Finn::: I'll stop those roughhousers from being rough!
Mountain Man::: Really? You'd do that for me?
Finn::: Yes sir! My name's Finn and I'm gonna help you out!
Jake::: But Finn, we're not gonna shut down the roughhouse for real are we?
Finn::: No way! But there's got to be some kind of solution. I’ll figure this out Mountain Man!Yup!
Head Marauder ::: Aw! Finn! Ready to get destroyed?
Finn::: N-nooo! Wait, um, actually, could you guys stop being so rough?
Marauders::: What!? 
Head Marauder ::: Whoa whoa whoa!What are you talking about Finn?
Finn::: Could you guy just tone down the roughhousing a little?
Marauder::: What!? 
Head Marauder ::: Whoa! Hey, hey. Shh. It's all right fellas. Finn, I'm sure this tone down the roughing thing has something to do with your boom boom, and I can respect that, but how can we POSSIBLY, make roughhousing, less rough?!
Finn:::I think I have a perfect idea!This'll soften your punches for smooth knock outs. Like punching a dream!
Marauder:::Ha! Ha! Pigs on my knees! Pigs on my knees! 
Jake::: That’s like math. 
Finn::: Mathematical.What do ya think? Fixed all youe problems right?
Mountain Man::: No! That was terrible! Now they’re just punching animals! It’s worse than before and it’s in no way a good solution!
Finn::: I’m sorry!
Mountain Man::: Well you should be! It’s not fair to those animals and it’s not fair to me! I might just start to cry again, you know? 
Jake::: Aw, man.
Finn::: Come on Jake. I gotta give this another shot!
Jake::: Finn this guy seems like a real nut job. You know what I mean? I don’t wanna get sucked into this guy’s hang-ups.
Finn::: Yes I do Jake. That’s what I vowed! To help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem!At least I have to try brother.
Jake:::So be it brother.
Finn::: Hey guys. I’m back.Hey guys. Guys? Men! Men. Please stop a second. Men! Boys? Please? I have more to ask of you! Bros? My bros?Brother?
Marauder::: What? Did you just pet me? I’ll pet you! Pet pet! Heeeey! Pet pet. Hey this is great! 
Marauder::: Hey! Did you just pet me?!
Marauder::: Yeah! I did!
Marauder::: Well I’ll pet you back! Wha-whoa. What the-? This is awesome! 
Finn::: Alright! This could be it! 
Head Marauder ::: Finn!You're really mixin' things up in the best of ways today!
Jake:::Maybe you can solve everyone's problems. Like a cherub with its bottom out.
Finn:::Okay, cool. Hey, I'm gonna go tell the mountain.
Jake::: Alright I’m gonna-stay here this time.
Finn:::So, everything's fine this time, right?
Mountain Man::: Yes! Thank you Finn!
Finn:::So the mountain is totally fine with everyone petting. I feel great.
Jake::: Right on man! The marauders are going crazy over the petting! They're petting each other raw! Check ‘em out!
Finn:::They look kinda rashy.
Head Marauder ::: Hey Finn! Hey man. As you can see the petting got sorta out of hand.Stop that! We are done with that! We’re going back to roughhousing!
Finn::: No wait fellas! The mountain doesn't like roughhousing.
Head Marauder ::: Well we don’t like not roughhousing! Ya see the problem here?
Finn::: Well. Well what if we rotate the entire mountain 180 degrees around, so the mountain’s facing the other direction. That way, you guys can keep roughhousing and the mountain doesn't have to watch it!
Head Marauder ::: Sounds fine with me!
Finn::: What do ya say mountain!
Mountain Man::: That’s okay. Only if you guys promise to stay healthy and not roughhouse after you rotate me.
Head Marauder ::: That mountain can talk?
Jake::: Just promise him anything, he’s out of his gourd.
Head Marauder ::: Yeah! We’ll stay healthy!
Mountain Man::: Oh! Thank goodness! Alright kids, spin me the math around!
Finn::: Now I just need to set up some sort of pulley system.
Mountain 2::: No! Over here! Don’t turn him around! If you do, I’ll miss looking at his beautiful back! It’s gorgeous!
Mountain Man::: Huh? What? Really!?
Finn::: What!? A-but-ahh. Um, maybe what we can do is...
Mushroom Creatures::: Excuse me. We need your help. There’s no music playing and we desperately want to dance!
Finn::: Oh, ah just a second you guys. I’ll a- I’ll help you out in one minute.
Coal Man::: Hey! Pipe down over there! I want some peace and quiet!
Finn::: Let me just a-

Finn::: Everybody please! One problem at a time!
Dragon:::My butt's itchy, but I can't scratch it!
Ice Cube Creature::: This water's too cold! 
Fish::: Mommy! Please keep the flies away from our mommy. 
Electroids:::That guy stole our triangle.
Toad:::They swiped my plum.
Marauders::: We wanna roughhouse! We wanna roughhouse!
Naked Wizard::: I’m naked! 
Mountain Man:::What’s happening!
Finn:::Ahhhhh! Everybody wants different things! And some of them want stuff that’s exactly the thing the others don’t want.
Jake::: Whoa, dude. Hold on. So this guy wants this and that guy wants that, but man. What do you want? 
Joshua::: Want do you want baby?Why are you crying? Margaret, this baby won’t tell me what’s wrong with it, and it’s stuck to a leaf, and it stinks.
Margaret:::Give it here Joshua. This baby needs love and kisses to be happy.There. See? Now it’s happy.
Joshua::: You just kissed a boom boom baby. So don’t expect any more sugar from me, sweetheart until we wash your dirty dirty face. 
Finn:::Hmm. Jake. What I want is to help anyone in need, so everyone is happy!
Jake:::Wow, that’s pretty corny man, but let’s do it dude! Wooohoo!
