Finn::: Jake, why didn't you stick to the plan?
Jake::: Psshh. Hey, you wanna bump baby lumps?
Finn::: Sick. No. Just try to follow the plans, okay?
Jake::: Yeah.
Finn::: Come on out, cuties. It's safe now.
Jake::: Now get out of here. 
Finn::: Hey, you hear something? Up there.It's a fat, fat warrior beat. It's all...It calls me forth. 
Jake::: Eh, it's probably just puberty calling.
Fight King::: Fighters! Fighters!Seek you glory from the Fight King?
Finn::: Mmmm... Maybe.
Fight King::: Then step forth beyond the Moonlight seal to bathe in blood and glory forever.
Finn::: Nah. This is a trap.
Jake::: Ka-psshh. We snuffed out that trap like champs! Trying to get us up in that cursed arena.
Finn::: Then I'd bet the exits would all magically seal behind us.
Jake::: We'd probably have to fight Gladiator Ghosts.
Finn::: Yeah. That sounds... so dumb... and FLIPPING AWESOME!
Jake::: We're back!
Fight King::: Fools! All exits are sealed!Now you must fight my Gladiator Ghosts!
Finn::: Yeah. Okay.
Finn:::  I'mma beat you with your own thing. Give it up!Hah-hah!Ooomph!
Primo::: Hyperion, I'm sorry!
Primo::: Hyperion, my love!
Hyperion::: I'll kill you for breaking your promise!
Finn::: Yeah. Ah-ha-ha-ha.
Fight King::: Good... Take these branches of palm.
Finn::: Yeah.
Jake::: That prize kinda stinks. Let's go, Finn. My thighs hurt.  
Finn::: Aw, man. Okay, it was fun. I'm keeping the branch. 
Fight King::: Where do you think you're going?You must earn thy freedom by defeating each of my ghosts! When you are ready, speak the Fight King's name, and I shall raise you for... battle.
Finn::: Hmm. Okay, I have a plan. We'll do what the Fight King says, and defeat his ghosts to earn our freedom.You're gonna follow my plan, right?
Jake::: Mmm-hmm. But, hey, if you replace me with a dummy, I could stay down here and dig for lava. Then I'd forge a molten hula-hoop.
Finn::: That's an entirely different plan... than my plan. What's the hula-hoop for?
Jake:::Morale, dude, This tomb will be as fun...As a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island. 
Jake::: Check it out, dude.Ba-duh-buh-da. It's a dirt dummy Jake. Just like in the plan.
Finn:::  We're ready... I guess, Fight King.
Fight King::: Gladitoria continues for you, human, and, er... dog?
Finn::: Yup. This is dog.
Fight King::: Arise, Priscus, Verus!
Verus:::Forgive me, Priscus! 
Fight King::: Pity. The dog falls.
Priscus::: Et tu, Verus?
Finn::: Heh.
Fight King::: The combat endeth. Now come closer, champion.
Jake::: Dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig. Two gongs? Something crazy's going on up there.It's me, Jake. Been here the whole time. Huh?
Fight King::: Come closer, my champion. You have proven worthy of my favor.
Finn::: Hah. Word.
Jake::: Oh, this is bad.
Fight King::: Accept your prize. 
Jake::: Finn?
Fight King::: Ah... The dog lives.
Jake::: Yeah. I lives. Finn, come with me, man.Whoa! Dude?
Finn::: Sorry, man. But you crossed my kill zone.
Fight King::: Fighters, rest now. 
Jake::: So, how's your side of the plan going?
Finn::: Plan? What plan?
Jake::: To escape. I dig and stuff, and you fight to win, 'member?
Finn::: Yeah. I fight. To hear bones breaking and meat tearing.
Jake::: Ghosts don't got meat.
Finn::: I fight... to FIGHT! 
Jake:::Hmm... Finn's acting weird. Probably due to a decrease in morale. Gotta get him that lava hula-hoop.
Finn::: We're ready for our next fight, Fight King.
Jake::: Gotta liven up this unhallowed ground.... for Finn.On a tropical island, underneath a molten lava moon. Hanging with the hula dancers, asking questions 'cause they got all the answers... 
Finn::: Habet! Habet! Habet! Heh-heh-heh. 
Achillea::: Amazonia, I'm sorry! 
Finn::: This next take-down is for you, my king! Rahhh...Heh-heh-heh.
Triumphus::: I need your forgiveness... 
Jake:::Puttin' on lotion, sittin' by the ocean, rubbin' it on my body, rubbing it on my body... 
Rutuba::: Non pugnent, Flamma! 
Finn::: Eludere!
Rutuba::: Cum missione, my friend! 
Finn::: Hoc habet! Whaaa! 
Amazonia::: Achillea...
Finn::: I have defeated every gladiator.
Fight King::: No, for there is one more opponent.
Finn::: Who?
Fight King::: Your dear companion! 
Jake:::Get me out of this caa-a-ve, 'cause it's nothing but a gladiator graa-a-ve. And if I stick to the plaa-a-n, I think I'll turn into a lava maa-a-n. I think I'll turn into a lava man!
Fight King::: Why do you stop?
Finn::: Fight King, this Jake was a farce. Let me face the real Jake!
Fight King::: Then this is round two, my vassal! Take his head for me!
Finn::: Yes, my king. 
Jake::: What about the plan?
Finn::: This is the plan, Jake! Raah! 
Jake::: You're gonna kill me?
Finn:::That's right! Everything has been building to this! The final battle! Brother against brother! TO THE DEATH!
Jake::: No!
Fight King::: Yes...
Fight King::: Yes...
Finn:::Fight King!!! I can't do it.I can't kill him, Fight King. I can't kill my best friend.
Jake::: Finn?
Finn::: Not without a BIGGER SWORD!
Fight King::: Yes... FINISH HIM!!!
Jake::: No!
Fight King::: Aaarghh... 
Finn::: Wink. 
Jake::: What?Dude, did you...? Was that all fake? Did you act all that out? Was that part of your plan?
Finn::: Mmm-hmm. 
Jake::: So you planned to get all cozy with the Fight King and almost kill me from the get-go?
Finn::: Pretty much.
Jake::: Why didn't you say so?
Finn::: Because you always bungle my plans. But, if you had bungled this one...I might have, for real, chopped your head off.
Jake::: That's some funky junk, brother.
Finn::: Hey, Jake, you notice how all these ghosts are walking in pairs?
Jake::: Oh, yeah. I bet they're like us. Best bros who got trapped in that arena.
Finn::: But now they're free!
