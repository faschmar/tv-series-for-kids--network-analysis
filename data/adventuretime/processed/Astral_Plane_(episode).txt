Finn:::Jake, so I just had this weird thought.
Jake:::Well, that's normal; people always have weird thoughts around campfires.
Finn:::Well, I don't know. Isn't is sort of strange that we keep pets? We kind of make them worship us.
Jake:::What?! Nah. 
Finn:::No, seriously, think about it. We're their only source of food and water and, like, tummy rubs. They basically have to love us.
Jake::: What's wrong with tummy rubs?
Finn:::Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great.That one star is so crazy, looks like it's vibrating.It's so cool. Wonder what it is, a planet? Do people live there? Are they friendly? Do they keep pets?
Jake:::Alright buddy,that's a little too much campfire. Time for bed. 
Finn:::Whoa... holy.Oh, dang.Uh, okay.Man, this is screwy. Maybe it's the can of beans we had for dinner.Looks- uh- homey. Wuh-oh! Whoa-Aah!Oh- right.
Mr. Fox::: Mmm, Boobafina, just pay me back when you can.
Finn:::Aww.
Astral Mr. Fox:::Hello? 
Finn:::Oh! Hey, you can see me?!
Astral Mr. Fox:::See you...? But if I didn't see you... Wait, what did you originally ask me?
Finn:::Oh, forget it, it's cool.
Astral Mr. Fox:::Do you, want a drink or something? I think I only have water anyway. .
Finn:::Whoop, here I go! Bye!
Astral Mr. Fox:::Oh, that was sort of rude. I hope he comes back. 
Finn::: That guy seemed lonely, not a lot of foxes up at this hour.Guess you get a lot of work done though.
Bounce House Princess:::Quittin' time!You don't have to go home but ya', oh, you know how it goes! 
Finn:::Bounce House Princess. . I didn't know B.H.P lived in a cave.Hey, this place is pretty nice.
Finn::: Whoa!
Bounce House Princess::: Forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five. forty-six, four-seven, fourth-eight, forty-nine... fifty! . Fifty-one, fifty-two . Who's there?!
Bounce House Princess::: Oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob!six four three two one! .
Finn::: Dude, what's your deal? 
Bounce House Princess::: Everything's okay now.
Finn:::Aww, geez, poor Bounce House Princess.
Finn::: Wha?
Bounce House Princess::: Bounce House Princess, you listen to me! Are you gonna' shut yourself off from other people forever?! I mean he or she could be really nice and- okay, mm, maybe if I just say very still, it'll just- it will just go away. 
Finn::: Gosh, I hope BHP's okay, I feel bad for just splittin' like that. Maybe they sorted it out, they could have stuff in common. You never know until you speak to the person.Oh, hey, Cloud Kingdom.
Finn::: What the? Ice King?
Ice King::: Yeah, I guess there's some cool people here, musics a little loud but the but the punch is top-drawer.
Lauren:::Mm hmm
Ice King:::Hey, you should come to one of my parties sometime; I'm friends with some pretty cool people too you know?
Lauren:::Uh huh, who are your friends?
Ice King:::Oh, uh- like that guy, Finn.
Lauren::: Finn?!
Ice King:::Yeah, Finn and I are pretty tight!
Lauren:::Hmmm
Cloud Woman 2::: Oh, hi, are you the ice-dude?
Ice King::: That's me, ice-dude. . Hey, have you ever seen the inside of an ice bear cave?
Lauren:::Did you say you know Finn the Human?
Cloud Man 1::: Hey, buddy, buddy! Care to freshen me up?! 
Ice King:::Yeah, yeah, now scram.
Lauren:::Hey, is Finn seeing anyone right now? Could you introduce us?Oh my glob! Is he here now?! 
Ice King:::So I guess you're more into the 'little brother-type'? Huh.
Cloud Man 2::: Hey Lauren, I heard your grandpa's given out ice! 
Ice King::: Ice?! I'll give you ice!Oh, looks like I put this party- on ice. Oh wait, you want ice? You, oh, you got iced!Anyway, oh, don't look at me like that Lauren. . Eh, this party was weak anyway.
Finn::: Poor Simon. Poor Simon, I guess? Poor Simon... sort-of? It's like some part of him wants to be a sad wong-lord.But why would anyone want that? Is there some... incentive? 
Finn:::Sheesh, I wonder if being a sad loner gives you more raw material to form song ideas. Is that where creativity comes from? From sad-biz?I am so high up now. I am so high up, there is no "high up". It's all just...Whoa! What the--? Whoooa!Space Lards! Ah man, Jake would be flipping out; trying to get that super-rare milk. Make a sick flan with that milk. Oh, well.
Finn:::Whoa! What's going on? You can't see me, right? 
Finn::: I'm in the Mother Lard! . What? Space birth!Okay, here we go! Whoa!Bye, guys. Oh, that was creative and it wasn't sad either so maybe birth is the greatest statement in all the universe.Hey, baby, ya' gonna give me a boost? . Here comes Mars. What the heck is going on though?Everybody's leaving!
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::Fire defense missiles!
Star Man:::Missiles away! Impact with Catalyst Comet in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::Yes! Do you think it worked, Star Man?
Star Man::: Uh, yeah, probably, right?Shoot! No effect! It's still coming right at us!
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::Was that all of our missiles?
Star Man:::Uh, yeah, I'm surprised we even had those ones. Like who would we shoot a missile at? Who'd we shoot at?!
Grob Gob Glob Grod::: I'm thinking, Star Man!
Star Man::: Rooot!
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::Grob. Assessment.
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::We're sunk, bro. This whole place is gonna be a stinkin' molten dump in a minute.
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::It doesn't make sense. Every 1,000 years, the Catalyst Comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an agent of change. But the comet has never been so off schedule - and it's never freakin' hit Mars!
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::What do you think, Finn the Human?
Finn:::Wha? Who, me? You can see me too?
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::Yes, I am Glob.
Finn:::Oh yeah. Hey, do you ever say "Oh my Glob?"
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::No, but sometimes Gob does.You're dreaming so far from home, it must be comet related.
Finn:::Yeah, but, I gotta question.
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::What's that?
Finn:::Well, if just being born is the greatest act of creation.Then what are you suppose to do after that?Isn't everything that comes next just sort of a disappointment?Slowly entropy-ing until we deflate into a pile of mush? 
Grob Gob Glob Grod:::Well, itâ€™s not enough to have created something amazing, right? What if I just let my Martian supersociety go to butt?
Finn:::But what's it worth if we're all gonna get blowed up right now?
Star Man:::Whoa! What are you doing?!
Finn:::Ahhh!Oh my bod!
Jake::: What is it, boyi?!
Finn:::...Glob is dead.
Evacuation Man::: Hello, Star Man, this is Evacuation Man, what's the sitch, can we go back yet?
Star Man::: Yes! Gob Glob Grod Grob diverted the comet, it's back on its normal path to Earth.
Evacuation Man:::And what about the G-Man?
Star Man:::No sign of Glob.
Evacuation Man::: 
Martin:::Ahh! Computer! What did we hit?!Oh, blobs...oh, for real blobs... 
Finn::: Hey, I think Bounce House Princess needs our help.
Jake::: Let's do it!
