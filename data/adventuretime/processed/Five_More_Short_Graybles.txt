Gunter wanted to drink the SALTY tears. And Football's tea was BITTER.Huh? What’s that you say? You thought the theme was the five fingers?Don’t be silly! No one’s had five fingers for twenty blablillion glaybles. Five telepathy glands maybe.Ah… slimmin’. Well anyway, looks like it’s that time again.I’ll see you crimpy glimmers on triode flimpin’ the diode!
