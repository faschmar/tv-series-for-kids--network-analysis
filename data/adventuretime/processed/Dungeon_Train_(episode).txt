Finn:::What... is the meaning of "soup"?
Jake:::What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest—?
Finn:::What... is the meaning of "spoon"?
Jake:::Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about Flame Princess? Y'know, it's okay if you are.
Finn:::Naw, that's all fine. I just been feeling kind of... gray, is all. Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately. Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y'know?
Jake:::Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, Finn, girls is like horses. When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again—on a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea. A lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned.
Finn:::Yeah, I-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle.
Jake:::Yeah, man, yeah!
Finn:::Or, like, if you mess up, you could get really hurt forever, or hurt someone you really care about.
Jake:::Eh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as Flambo's brother says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the— Whoa! What?!
Jake:::What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way!
Finn:::Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really.
Jake:::Oh, yeah.
Jake:::It's two hours later now. What the stunk?Oh, okay.Hey, the train just goes in a big circle! We can cut right through the middle, blingle, blongle, blungle! Come on!Wha-hey! You know, I just had another idea! If we just stay put here on the train, we could ride it all the way to the cave.Blingle, blongle, blungle!
Creature:::Gimme! Gimme the loot! 
Finn:::Ow!
Finn:::Yeeow!
Creature:::Gimme! Gimme that hat! 
Finn:::Knock it off! 
Creature:::Aah!
Creature:::Oh, dang!
Jake:::Hey, Finn!
Finn:::Whoa!
Jake:::Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt!
Finn:::Dang, look at that sword!Whoa. Feels kinda right.Whoosh. Whoosh. Vvsh, vvsh.Whoa!
Jake::: Pretty fun, huh?
Finn:::Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun!
Jake:::You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train?
Finn:::Yes! 
Jake::: 
Finn:::Whoa, Crystal Ants, I think! 
Jake::: Cool!
Finn:::Ha-ha! Yeah!Die, die, die, die, die, die, die! 
Jake:::Welcome back, buddy.
Finn:::Man, look at all this rad loot!
Jake:::Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday.
Finn:::Whoa, what do you mean? We just started only, like, three hours ago.
Jake:::Heheh, yeah. I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all. All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same. It's a little boring.
Finn:::Oh, come on.It's fun! Just one more car. Come on.Come on, man!Come on!
Jake:::All right, just one more.
Finn:::Ha-ha, yes!
Finn:::Hmm? Where is everybody?
Jake:::Hey, hey! Empty car—think we beat it, buddy.
Finn:::Whoa, man! Boss battle! Let's chew it up! 
Jake:::Okay, but this is the last one, okay?
Finn:::We'll see!
Finn:::Ha-ha!
Jake:::Hey, man,you remember we were going to that weird cave? Bet it's not too late to check it out.
Finn::: Eh, weird cave, weird train—I'm cool here.
Jake::: Okay.
Finn:::Hyah! 
Head:::Ahhhh, gimme a break!
Finn:::Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot!Oh, yeah. 
Jake:::No, thank you.
Finn:::Jake, hurry. Next car!
Finn:::Slime crimes! 
Jake:::You have fun. I'm just gonna watch. 
Finn::: Hey.
Finn:::Ow!Ow. Cool... acid!
Jake:::Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry?
Finn:::Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while.
Jake:::More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window!
Finn:::Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break.
Jake:::'Kay! Well, we'll go back to the tree house, and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like.
Jake:::And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or—
Finn::: Look.Now we don't gotta do that thing you wanted to do. 
Jake::: Aah!
Finn:::Hot meat!
Jake:::Ants again? 
Finn:::"Ant" no thang!Yah!Caught with your "ants" down! "Ants" for nothin'!Forget about "ant"!What's wrong? Feeling antsy? 
Jake::: Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. We did all the ants!
Finn:::Same car,but those were blue ants. These are red ants.
Jake:::Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you.
Finn:::Man, no way. All this feels good.Like my inside voice is saying, "Hey, keep it up. This is good stuff."Aah! Hey!Ah! Like when you made those biscuits way back? And I kept eating them until they were all gone. Like that!
Jake:::Finn,I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter!
Finn:::Yeah! 
Finn:::Boss fight! 
Finn::: 
Boss:::My jacket-sta! 
Finn::: Check it out::: battle moon.
Jake:::What?Finn! This is a future crystal! Look!
Jake:::That's you, dude! You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train!
Future Finn::: Get "ant" of town.
Finn:::Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life!
Finn:::Oh, Hair Apes!
Jake:::Nuh-uh, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house.You can come with me if you want.
Finn:::What? No, man! It's better on the train; stuff makes sense here.
Hair Ape::: 
Finn:::Yow!
Jake:::I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair.
Finn:::You'll be back.
Jake:::No, I won't, Finn.Goodbye!
Finn:::Hey!"Hair" we go!
Jake::: What're you doin' up here?
Hair Ape::: 
Jake::: Are you gettin' sick of things down there, too?
Jake:::Mm-hmm.
Jake:::You're not gonna try and zap me, are you?
Jake:::I wonder what my kids are doin'. 
Jake:::Hey!I knew it!
Jake::: Gotta find that kid. Hey, Finn!Fi—oh!Umm... hey, there, friend. I ain't lookin' for no trouble. Just lookin' for my friend, Finn. Maybe you seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l—
Finn:::Hey, hey! Jake, it's me!I'm just all souped up now.
Jake:::Ah, jeez, Finn. I... for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys.
Finn::: Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl.
Jake:::Wait, you are! You are one!
Finn:::What? Those guys are cool!
Jake:::That's it, man! I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not! 
Finn:::Jake, stay back. I mean it!
Jake:::Oh, please. What're you gonna do? I'm ten times stronger than—
Jake:::Ah, gross! 
Finn::: Yoink!Pff, Jake—tryin' to tell me what to do. Pff, yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now let's see what we got here.Apple, apple, chicken, apple...Oh, yeah, that little orb in which I rule! Let's see that again, orb.Yeah, that's right. Lookin' right.Wait a second, who's that sad ward little guy followin' me around?Jake? All those years—he stayed with me.
Future Jake:::Finn, can we slow down? My feet hurt.
Future Finn:::What?
Finn:::Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'ma set this right.
Jake:::Finn? Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you, I swear. Just get this stuff off of me.
Finn::: No, I'm sorry, Jake. I messed up, but don't worry. It's all over now.
Jake:::You mean we're gettin' off the train?
Finn:::Well... you are. I'm gonna keep playin' for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two.
Jake:::Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'? It's got its hooks in you! 
Finn::: No, no for real!My inside is tellin' me it's time. Here,see for yourself.
Jake:::Yeah, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. That... is what I'm talkin' about.
