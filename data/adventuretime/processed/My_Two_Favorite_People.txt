Jake:::Pussy cat! Come here!
Jake::: Hey!
Jake::: Help!
Finn:::Don't worry! His spells never last long.
Jake::: Who are these guys? This is a great fight!
Finn::: Yeah! You never fought them? They come out every day at four o’clock on the dot.
Jake:::I guess that's because I meet Lady Rainicorn every day at four o'clock on the dot. Oh shoot! I'm late!
Finn::: You should stay, man. At five o'clock every day, I chop both their heads off, and they grow them back for the next day.
Jake::: Aw, man, that sounds awesome! I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend.
Finn::: Boo!
Jake:::I should probably go. I'll see ya later, buddy. 
Finn::: Bye! Hyaaaaaaaaah! 
Jake:::Oh!
Jake::: Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Finn and I were fighting this shark and science cat, and I lost track of time. Anyway, I’m here now, M'lady, and I have brought to you half an orange.
Lady Rainicorn::: Ooh! 고마워! ("Thanks!") 
Jake::: Nice! Now make that green! 
Jake:::Ha ha ha! Yeah, that's good.
Lady Rainicorn:::자러 가야겠다. (" I may have to go to sleep.")
Jake::: Sleep! But we were supposed to play viola together!
Lady Rainicorn::: 미안해. ("I'm sorry.")]니가 늦게 왔잖아. ("It's because you came late.")
Jake:::Yeah. Sorry again for coming so late.
Lady Rainicorn::: 잘 자. ("Good night.")Jake:::Good night.
Shelby::: Hi Jake.
Jake::: Oh, hey, Shelby.
Shelby::: Why you looking so down in the dumps?
Shelby::: No response, huh? Guess you're good.
Jake::: I'm fed up, Shelby!
Shelby::: Hmm?
Jake::: Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn.
Jake::: And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missin' out on Lady Rainicorn!Oh!
Shelby:::Hey, Jake, why don't you just hang out with both of them at the same time?
Jake:::And then I won't miss anything! Shelby! My problems are solved.
Jake::: Ah, isn't this great? This is totally great.Isn't it?
Finn::: Yeah.
Jake:::Isn't it?
Lady Rainicorn::: 맞아. ("You’re right.") 
Finn:::What? What did she say?
Jake::: She said she also thinks it's great.
Finn::: Oh.
Jake::: Yeah.
Jake::: Hmm...Hey, did you know that you both have an awesome sense of humor?
Finn::: We do?
Jake::: Yeah! Anybody have a joke?
Finn::: Oh, I have a joke!Okay,okay. Knock knock.
Lady Rainicorn::: 누구세요 ("Who's there?")
Jake::: She said, "who's there?"
Finn::: Diarrhea!
Jake::: 쟤가 설사래. ("He said "diarrhea.")
Lady Rainicorn::: 어, 나도 들었어. 뭐야, 하나도 재미없잖아. ("Oh, I got it too. What was that? It hardly qualifies as a joke.") 
Finn::: Did she say diarrhea who?
Jake::: Uh, no. No, she didn't say, "diarrhea who?" She didn't... say it. Lady, how 'bout you tell a joke?
Lady Rainicorn::: 글쎄.. 뭐가 있었을까? 아! 우리 완전히 다 벗고 상추밭 미친듯이 뛰어다닌 거 기억 나?그 농부 아저씨 완전 맛이 갔었지! ("Maybe... What could it have been? Ah! Do you remember when we got completely naked, and frantically ran around in the farmer's cabbage patch?That farmer got crazy mad!")
Finn::: What's the joke?
Jake::: Uhh... well, the joke doesn’t translate very well.
Finn::: Man, I- I might leave. Is it okay if I leave? I kind of want to go fight something.
Jake:::Noooo! Don’t leave.If there was only some way you two could talk to each other directly.Oh, dude! I just remembered! There's a universal translator device at the bottom of Lake Szelezon!
Finn:::The lake guarded by evil Lake Knights?
Jake::: Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there. Let's all go and get it!
Finn::: WhoaJake! You’re inviting Rainicorn? No offense, but isn't she a little too sweet for deadly adventure?
Jake::: Trust me, Finn, she’s the Rowdy Queen. She can do anything!
Finn::: Hmmm. Alright! Trust pound!
Finn::: Underwater camouflage!
Finn::: Lady! You are incredible! You should adventure with us all the time!
Jake:::All according to plan.
Lady Rainicorn::: 고마워, 나도 재밌었어. ("Thanks, I enjoyed it too.")
Finn::: Uhhh, what?
Jake:::Here's the translator.Let’s see here.The voice options are... Old man, nerdy alien, ooor nightmare?Try sayin' something, toots!
Lady Rainicorn:::... and then I ate all the peaches in the orchard, and that farmer was sooo angry!
Finn:::I like this voice!
Lady Rainicorn:::...and that's the end of my story.
Jake:::Well, at least with old man option we can understand him, I MEAN HER! I mean you, sugar!
Lady Rainicorn::: Hop on my back and I'll give you a ride home!
Finn:::Whatever you say grandpa!Hai-yah!
Lady Rainicorn::: Come on my darling. Wrap your legs around me.
Jake:::I remember why I drowned that translator now.
Finn::: Hey grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings?
Lady Rainicorn::: Well, light travels from the sun. Then bounces off of our planet and then back into our eyes so we can perceive color.
Jake::: Whoa! 
Lady Rainicorn::: My body can intercept that light and dance around on it. 
Jake::: Lady! It's a little rocky in the back seat here!
Finn:::Shmow!That forest wizard is giving away free power rings!
Lady Rainicorn::: Do you wanna try gettin' some Finn?
Finn::: Yeahs!

Lady Rainicorn::: We thought you were behind us the whole time!
Jake::: Noooo!I fell off your tail end!I was shouting your name!

Finn::: Jake! Check out these power rings! 
Jake::: Whoa. That's cool! You got ten of them?
