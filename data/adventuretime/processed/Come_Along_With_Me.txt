Shermy:::Haha, you're doing it wrong. Like this. 
Beth::: Shermy, this is silly as heck. Beatboxing is for babies.
Shermy::: No, it's not. I am a man.
Beth:::I don't know about that, but you should start thinking about your future.
Shermy:::What about you, Princess Zip? What are your goals?
Shermy:::Ha! Princess Zip's got a one-track mind!
Shermy:::Prize Ball Guardian's back!
Shermy:::Let's get 'em!
Shermy:::Get that boulder! 
Shermy:::Hup! Whap!
Shermy:::Ha! Here it comes!
Shermy::: Boy! My knots suck!
Shermy:::Yeah, I see you.
Beth:::Hey, Sherm, you see this?
Shermy:::Nope.
Beth:::It looks like the Guardian scuffed something up.
Shermy:::Ohhh!Whoa!
Beth:::It's beautiful! Let's take it home, and I'll learn about it with my brain.
Shermy:::You and your brain!
Shermy:::"On a tropical island, on a tropical island..." 
Shermy:::It looks so old, Beth! Whose do you think it is... or was?
Beth:::There's no markings on it or anything. I think we should find the King of Ooo and ask him.
Shermy:::What? Beth, the King of Ooo is just a myth... Come on, Beth!
Beth:::That's what I thought, too, but I was doing some research at the library–
Shermy:::Nooooo! Not the library! You can't make me!
Beth:::Shermy, I have the book here. Already checked it out.
Shermy:::Oh.
Beth:::He's supposed to have lived in a cave at the top of Mount Cragdor.
Shermy:::Really?
Beth:::Uh-huh... He's supposed to have lived forever.
Shermy:::Come on, Beth! Come on, come on, come on!
Shermy:::Come on, Beth! Come on, come on, come on!
Shermy:::I did it. I found him! The King of Ooo.
BMO:::Welcome, friends, I've been expecting you. Because of my proximity radar. Hehehe... Come on inside.
Shermy:::Wow! King of Ooo, you must be rich!
BMO:::Yeah, that's me alright.
BMO:::I'm sure you are very thirsty after your journ...
Shermy:::Whoops...
Shermy:::This place is wild.Huh? This is crazy!
BMO:::Please be careful with...
Beth:::Sorry, sir... My big feet.
Shermy:::Hey, Beth, look. I'm a princess, too 
Beth:::Shermy...
Shermy:::I-I think it's okay... 
Beth:::Be careful... This stuff isn't ours. Woops. Oh... 
BMO:::Well, goodbye!
Beth:::Oh, no, no...
BMO:::Have fun on the other side of this door.
Beth:::But... We came here to ask about something.
BMO:::No, don't worry about it. Please leav... 
Beth::: Do you recognize it?
BMO:::Yeah... It belonged to my best friend. Fred!
Shermy:::Fred!
BMO:::No... Not Fred... His name was, Phil! He was an amazing hero, and he was there at the end.
BMO:::Do you know about The Great Gumwar?
Shermy:::Mnm-mnm.
BMO:::Well, get ready to have your hair blown back!
Finn:::Hey, there it is again! It's close.
Jake:::Let me see!
Finn::: It looks like Normal Man, Betty, and...Maja?
Jake::: Come on!
Finn:::Hey, just-
Jake:::Let me-Maja's got smoke coming off her.
Finn:::You think they're with the Gumbaldians?
Jake:::I don't know, but they're flippin' freakin' me out.Guess we better tell PB, huh?
Finn::: Yeah, I guess.
Jake:::Hey man, don't even worry about all this war stuff. I know we'll find a way to fix this thing. Come on! You'll see. 
BMO :::And so the Princess was mother to her own uncle, and that made him mad. But she had friends, and he had friends, so they decided to have a bad fight - the biggest fight that Ooo had ever seen.
Princess Bubblegum:::Then it's settled. At the stroke of high noon, when the sun is at its most zenith-est, Banana Battalions three and four will initiate operation "Shut the Door", forming a pincer formation around Gumbald's exposed nether legions, isolating his rear and - 
Duke of Nuts:::Um, excuse me? Excuse me. Princess, if I may. I think I have a plan that'll put an end to all this tonight. I just need a Bowie knife, a snowmobile, a parachute,rubber gloves, and, uh... 
Lemongrab::: Terrible, mm! Terrible plan!... Mm! No!
Duke of Nuts:::But, but my - 
Lemongrab:::My plan! Hot air balloon!
Princess Bubblegum:::Hey! Now's not the time. Unless we win this fight today, we all get to take a nice Pep-Butt-style sponge bath in Uncle Gumbald's extra-strength lobotomy sauce, understand?
Lemongrab:::No.
Duke of Nuts:::Not really.
Princess Bubblegum:::Well I do, so we're doing this my way. Now-
Finn:::Um, PB?
Princess Bubblegum:::Finn, you're back. How goes the scouting?
Finn:::Um-
Jake:::We saw Normal Man and Betty flying around with Maja, and they were chanting.
Princess Bubblegum:::Hmm, very peculiar.
Finn:::Hey, maybe this is, like, a bad omen. Like, to see the King of Mars, um, up among the stars? It's like a bad omen, and you should call off the battle. I think I heard that somewhere...
Camera:::Low battery. Please connect to power...
Cake Person::: Long live Gumbaldia!
Princess Bubblegum:::Stonk! That dang Gumbald just peeped all my tactics!He's left me no choice. The attack begins now.
Princess Bubblegum :::Stonk! That dang Gumbald just peeped all my tactics! 
Gumbald:::Well, that settles it then. If we know, and she knows, and we know she knows we know - which we do - then we know we have no choice. We must strike now. Ladies and gentlemen, to war!
Marceline:::A word?
Princess Bubblegum:::All right, just make it quick. ...Please.
Marceline:::Well, I know you're under a lot of pressure here, but I... I just wanna ask you to reconsider. I mean, I don't like to flaunt my suffering cred, but I've lived through something like this once before, and...I'm just not really tryin' to help start that all up again.
Princess Bubblegum:::I understand, Marceline, I really do. But I just can't see another way out of this. Look, I've gotta go.Let's talk more when this is all over. Wish me luck, okay?
Marceline:::Good luck!
Jake::: What if PB's right about this? Maybe she'll just go whup Gumbald's rear, and then things'll go back to normal.
Finn:::Nah, man, she's wrong. This is all wrong. Even if she wins now, this is never gonna end; I can feel it. It's like the whole world's going crazy, man, like we're living in, one, big... 
Jake:::Finn?
Finn:::... one big nightmare.
Lumpy Space Princess:::Here we go.
Colonel Candy Corn::: War! War! War! War! War! War!
Princess Bubblegum:::Banana Guard 500s, you're on!
Banana Guard 500:::Up we go.In position, ma'am. Code name, "Father's Brother", appears testy.
Gumbald::: More bananas!? You're weird, Bubblegum!You! Give me your lunch. Got a banana in here?Is this a banana? Hey, niece!
Princess Bubblegum:::Yes?I'm doing it! I'm soundin' the war horn! 
Finn:::Wait!
Princess Bubblegum:::What!?Dang it, Finn!
Finn:::PB! He sees that you're serious! Maybe he'll back down now. Please listen to me! We've been friends for a long time. 
Princess Bubblegum::: Okay, Finn. We'll give him one last chance.
Gumbald:::What?Come on.
Finn:::Here they come!
Gumbald:::Hurry this up. I want a war.
Finn:::Hey, Fern.
Princess Bubblegum:::Uncle Gumbald, I demand that you de-escalate your forces now.
Gumbald::: Listen to yourself. You're a toddler, Bonnibel.
Princess Bubblegum::: SURRENDER OR DIE!
Gumbald:::No!
Jake:::That's my cue!
Princess Bubblegum:::What?
Jake:::Hya-pow! 
Lumpy Space Princess::: They're dead! They're actually dead!
BMO :::And so they were dead. ...No, not dead.
Princess Bubblegum:::What is this place? Finn?
Finn:::Last resort! Sorry, PB, but you were acting like total nuts out there. Now you guys have to hash this out in the unconscious world.
Gumbald:::This is... a dream?
Jake:::Yeah, man. You can basically do anything in dreams.
Gumbald:::Sneak attack!If we destroy them here, maybe they'll die in the real world.
Princess Bubblegum:::Psst! Not if I destroy you first!
Finn:::No! We need love, not war!
Princess Bubblegum:::Good idea.Love bazooka! Put down your weapons, or I'll bazooka you!
Gumbald:::No!
Finn:::Thank goodness for a singing pot beast to de-escalate the situation.
Jake:::Oh, this sandwich is way too much for me. Jermaine always liked splitting sandwiches.
Jermaine::: Mmm! Thanks, bro.
Gumbald:::I'm gonna figure out how to wake myself up and take my revenge on you sleeping chumps!
Fern:::You're leaving me?
Gumbald:::You're on your own, kid. 
Princess Bubblegum:::He's rooting into the ground. Ready, aim...
Finn:::No!You're supposed to be having some kind of epiphany!
Princess Bubblegum::: Here's my epiphany::: you've gone rogue on me! I'm outtie five thou! 
Finn:::Fern!Come on! Snap out of it, man!Aah!
Fern:::I don't need your help. 
Finn:::Jake? Help me!
Jake:::I want to help you,but I can't lose this job.
Jermaine::: Waiter! Oh, waiter!
Finn:::Dude...
Fern:::I'm going to fly around, and wreck things, until I feel better! Or until I tire myself out.
Finn:::Peaceful thoughts...Fern!
Jermaine:::It all looks so good.What's up with that bird? Why are you looking at me, bird?Bad bird!
Jake::: Everybody gets an evil doppelganger but me.
Jermaine:::I'll be your evil doppelganger!
Jake:::Jermaine, you're the best! 
Princess Bubblegum:::Enough, Gumbald! 
Gumbald::: Pinch me, I want to wake up!
Princess Bubblegum:::Gumbald! We're ending this here.
Gumbald:::So be it.
Finn:::If you could just calm down and be cool, it would be a great thing that there's two of us.
Fern:::Why don't you just fight me like a real butterfly!?
Finn:::We're two sides of the same coin!
Fern:::You'll never understand what it's like to be me. I'm TORMENTED! 
Finn:::I'm ALSO that sometimes!
Fern:::Prove it, or I'll never stop fighting you.
Jermaine::: Oh geez, how's he gonna do that?
Jake:::Hmm?Finn, we'll be right back.
Finn:::Okay- ah! 
Princess Bubblegum::: Come on, little gum. Don't run away from happiness! I'm gonna fix you!
Gumbald:::No, no, no!
Princess Bubblegum:::Just ONE drop. Drip a drop, I drip a drop. Not gonna stop, till I drip a drop.
Gumbald:::Hmm? 
Princess Bubblegum::: Drip, drip!The juice! NOOOO!......Wuh-what?
Gumbald::: Call me... princess.
Jermaine:::What are we looking for?
Jake:::Mm, I can't quite picture it. But I'm pretty sure Finn buried it here.
Jermaine:::... In the underground balloon mall. Remember how much balloon animals used to cheer Finn up?
Jake:::Yeah...
Lady Rainicorn:::그래. ("Yeah.")
Jake::: Huh?
Jake:::Uh, Lady, where's Jermaine?
Lady Rainicorn:::쉿. ("Shh.")이런 어두운 지하굴에서는 살살 걸어야 돼. ("You have to walk carefully in a dark cave like this.")
Jake:::Aww, sleepy puppies.
Jake:::Yee! 
Jake:::And I'm done!
Lady Rainicorn:::걱정하지 마, 제이크! 내가 처치할게! ("Don't worry, Jake! I got this!")Jake:::What? Oof! 
Charlie::: Your farts aren't funny, dad!
Jake:::NOOOOOO!!!Huh? Oh dang!Is that... Finn's vault?Aargh! Nightmare fart!
Candy Bonnibel::: It's beautiful...
Gumbald:::No! Oh, why didn't I build an armature?
Candy Bonnibel::: I can help you, Princess! Just listen to this!Watch me do my tiny taffy dance! 
Finn:::Fern, come on! I'm not fighting you.
Finn & Fern:::Oh, what reeks?
Jake:::Repressed memories! 
Finn & Fern:::My vault!?
Jake:::Proof! 
Finn:::See? this is our shared torment!
Fern:::Dude, I blocked this stuff out for a reason!
Finn::: Well, now you know how I feel about knowing how you feel about!
Fern::: Okay, okay! Just make it stop!
Finn:::We gotta confront them head on!
Finn:::Fern. This is why I brought us here. We can defeat him together.
Princess Bubblegum's voice :::No fear.
Finn:::So you're the nasty grass wad that's been holding my Finn boy hostage.
Grass Demon:::Without me, he's got no body. So back off. 
Finn:::You sicken me.
Past Finn:::I'm me again. It feels like it's been years.
Past Finn:::He was right. I've got no body.
Jake:::Ah, don't worry. It's just a dream!
Lumpy Space Princess::: They're dead! They're actually dead!Never mind! They're okay!
Finn:::Fern! You really are disintegrating!
Jake:::My bad.
Gumbald:::Bonnie, I...
Princess Bubblegum:::I'm so sorry for what I put you through for all those centuries. The Candy Kingdom was your dream, and I took it from you.
Gumbald:::Bonnie, that means so much to me. Come. From now on, we'll live in peace.Drat.
Princess Bubblegum:::WHAT?!
Lolly:::He never was the epiphany type. But I am willing to let bygones be bygones.
Princess Bubblegum:::Very well. Two Candy Kingdoms, it is!
People from Both Sides:::Hurray!
BMO :::And so, in the end, they decided not to have the big fight.
Beth:::Oh! So you meant, like, the end of the war. I thought you meant like the end of the world.
BMO:::No, no, no. That happened next.
Lumpy Space Princess:::So I guess everyone's just going home, huh?
Jake:::Yep.
King Man:::We donked up for real. 
Finn:::Jake... what am I lookin' at?
Jake:::Uh... we saved the day. So, maybe that big baby's here to give us presents for doing a good job?
Fern:::Okay, I'm not an expert, but this seems bad.
Flame Princess:::You ain't kiddin', shrubs.
Lumpy Space Princess:::Oh - no - ! 
Marceline:::Bonnie! What did you do?!
Princess Bubblegum:::It wasn't me!
Ice King::: It's been real cool being in this rogue's gallery with you. Me and Gunter were gonna go, uh...Oh... my...GOLB!
Simon Petrikov:::Look, Betty. I keep seeing reference to this mysterious entity that embodies chaos.
Betty Grof:::That's great! Come on, let's make sundaes.
Simon:::GOLB would say ice cream is without meaning. Just empty calories devoid of purpose.
Betty:::Good thing he isn't here then.
Simon::: His presence is felt in every crevice where chaos lurks. Imagine if we could somehow harness all that dank energy...!
Betty:::Hey! You want some cherries with that chocolate syrup?
Simon::: Oh!Sure.
Betty:::Catch! 
Simon:::Have you thought about using sliced almonds for the sundaes? 
Ice King::: ...I don't know who that is!
Lolly:::Don't let it touch you!
Candy Person:::No, I'm a loner!
Marceline:::Peebs, this is the worst thing ever! If somebody doesn't stop this, it could be the end of Ooo!
Princess Bubblegum:::You're right, Marceline. I gotta do something!Banana guards!
Banana Guard:::Uh, no.
Princess Bubblegum:::Obey my command! Flee for your lives! If you fight, the demon will just add you to its mass!
Banana Guard:::Can we flee in a panic?
Princess Bubblegum:::Yes!
Finn:::FYI, Princess, I'm not going anywhere!
Jake::: I'm also staying.
Princess Bubblegum:::Thanks, guys.
Marceline:::I'm in, too. This is a war I have to fight. We all have to.
Fern:::Me too! I'll defend Ooo down to my last blade. 
Princess Bubblegum:::Gumball guardians!
Gumball Guardians:::Yes, mom?
Princess Bubblegum:::Stop that monster!
Gumball Guardians:::Okay.Containing enemy!Gross.
Lolly::: Cake, pick me up!My friends! It is time to set aside past differences! We must join the fight!Hmm! Forwards! 
Finn:::Normal Man! Come on, wake up!
King Man::: Is that Ice King?
Finn:::How do we stop these guys?Come on, Jake.
Jake::: H-H-H-Horse!
Gumball Guardian #1:::Ugh! My balance!
Jake:::War is the worst, dude!
Gumball Guardian #1::: Sorry, mom... 
Princess Bubblegum:::My guardian!
King Man:::Ice King! Ice King!
Ice King:::What's up?
Jake::: Ho-ho-ho.
Finn:::How do I stop this!What?
King Man:::You are the only one who can stop this! Betty's up there, trying to harness the power of GOLB! We have to snap her out of that trance and banish GOLB, or we're all doomed! If anyone can do it, it's you.
Ice King:::Sounds great! Im'a save the world! Gumball Guardian #2::: Enemy threat restrained.
Princess Bubblegum:::They got him!
Gumball Guardian #2::: Awaiting orders.Help me, mom. I'm turning nasty...
Banana Guards:::Princess, we came back to help!Eee! Help us, princess!
Princess Bubblegum:::Ugh! 
Ice King:::Evil penguins!
Jake:::Don't worry, guys! 
Finn:::Jake!
Jake:::I believe in you, Ice King!Aah! I didn't think this through!... 
LSP:::So this is it.Oh tender lad! I give you the parting gift of my lips.
Lemongrab:::I find your proposal......ACCEPTABLE!
LSP:::You're welcome.
Finn:::Betty! You have to stop this!
King Man:::Go ahead. Talk to her, IK.
Ice King:::Who?Oh, it's weird lady! Hey, lady. ...I'm diggin' your primitive dance style!
King Man:::No! You're supposed to stop her, not encourage her! You gotta dig deep inside and find those magical words to shake her outta that trance! Get personal and emotional!
Ice King:::Personal? Emotional? Oh! Just like a fan-fic!
King Man:::No!...
Ice King:::"I feel like nothing was real until I met you. I feel like we connect. And I really get you. If I said 'You're a beautiful girl,would it upset you? The way you look tonight, silhouetted, I'll never forget it."
Betty:::Simon...
Ice King:::Oh, oh,Fionna!... Your fist has touched my heart...
Betty:::What... You're trying to stop me!?When I'm this close to harnessing the most powerful force in the universe and finally saving you!?
Ice King:::Yeah, I guess. ...Right, Finn?
Betty::: Emotional super-charge! 
Maja:::Finally! My time - 
Ice King:::Ice King!
Flame Princess::: Burn, burn, burn! PB, get me some backup! Ugh!Ugh!
Princess Bubblegum:::It's headed this way!
Fern:::I'll take down this beast! Fern's way! 
Princess Bubblegum::: Fern!No, no, no, no, no! NO!!! 
Marceline:::Bonnie!
Cake Person :::Thanks.
Princess Bubblegum:::Marcy?...
Marceline::: You're okay!
Princess Bubblegum:::My armor has an emergency - 
Marceline:::You scared me.
Princess Bubblegum:::What?
Marceline:::Even back when we weren't talking, I was so afraid something bad would happen to you, and I wouldn't be there to protect you. And...I don't want to lose you again.
Princess Bubblegum:::Hey, I'm a tough gum. Nothing never happening to me, never.
Marceline:::I know, I... Girl, you phrased that so weird.
Princess Bubblegum:::I might have a concussion.
Cake Person :::Uh-oh. 
Ice King:::Owie!
Betty:::Simon, your crown!
Ice King:::What......happened, lady? 
Betty:::Don't panic, but I think Golb is digesting us.Breaking us apart, layer by layer,...down to our essential forms.
Finn:::I'll get us outta here. 
Ice King::: Betty...?
Betty::: It's good to see you, Simon.
Simon:::It's good to be seen. 
Finn:::Hey, Ice Simon! Use the crown before we're totally crushed!
Simon:::It's not working! Yah!Finn, it's hopeless. You can't punch your way out of his guts.
Jake::: Okay, Jake. You can do this! You can stop 'em solo!They'll be talking about this fight for years! And by "they," I mean BMO and Shelby.Finn! This is for you!
BMO:::What's all the ruckus out there? Oh. It's up to BMO to save the -
Jake:::Okay, bud. There's no reason to freak out just because the tree house isGONE...!Ah! BMO...? Ah no, man! Your little face!
BMO:::It's okay, Jake. You always try to protect me and Finn. But sometimes we are going to get hurt. How about today, you let me be the papa?
BMO:::"Time is an illusion that helps things make sense, so we are always living in the present tense. It seems unforgiving when a good thing ends, but you and I will always be back then. You and I will always be back then. Singing will happen, happening, happened; will happen, happening, happened. And we'll happen again and again, 'cause you and I will always be back then - "
BMO::: "... you and I will always be back then." 
Princess Bubblegum:::Whoa. What's up with him?
BMO::: You better hush up while my baby boy is sleeping!
Princess Bubblegum:::Keep singing!
BMO:::Okay!"Will happen,happening, happened. Will happen, happening, happened. And we'll happen again and again, 'cause you and I will always be back then."
Marceline:::Oh man! He hates music!
Princess Bubblegum:::Ugh, duh! GOLB is discord. It's the harmony! Harmony hurts them!
BMO:::My art is a weapon!
Princess Bubblegum::: Everyone! I need you all to harmonize along with BMO!
BMO:::I wrote this for my son, Jake!
Marceline:::I don't know if we can kill Golb with music, PB!
Finn::: I always figured I'd go out saving somebody.
Simon:::Hey, no one gets to choose how it happens. The most important thing is that we're here together.
Finn::: Shh, shh! Do you hear that? It sounds like Jake.Oh-ho, it is Jake! Look, we can leave this way!
Simon:::Betty, we're saved!
Betty:::Go, there's something I have to do first.
Simon:::What!?
Betty:::I figured out what's wrong with the crown. It reset, just like us. It's in its primal wishing form now.
Simon:::Who cares! Leave it!
Betty:::This world will end unless GOLB is banished. So I'm gonna make... the wish.
Finn:::Guys, it's clenching!
Simon:::We'll make the wish after we escape!
Betty:::I have to do it here. The crown could revert once we leave. I gamed it out.
Simon:::But I can't... 
Betty:::I'm sorry for messing everything up. 
Simon:::Wait! Betty? Betty!
Betty:::I wish to banish GOLB from this world.
Betty:::Uh-oh, um... I wish for GOLB to disappear, I wish for GOLB to disappear!
Betty:::No! He's too strong! Even for the crown.However it has to happen. ...I wish for the power to keep Simon safe.
Marceline:::Slide faster, you ding-dongs!Simon!
Shelby:::Hmm, check, plea- 
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant:::We heard there was a war- 
Finn:::She did it! Yeah, Betty! Whoo!
King Man:::What has she done?...
Slime Princess:::Well, great! I don't like this guy either!
Simon:::No... Betty? Betty!Betty! Oh my, my Betty, my princess, why did you... 
Marceline:::You're back. It's what she wanted more than anything in the world.
Gunter:::Wenk.
Jake:::Jump him! He's gonna wish to be all space villain!
Neptr:::What?
Jake:::He's a big evil alien stuck in a penguin!
Neptr:::Oh!... I see.
Ice Thing:::... la-ba-droo-la-da-boo! Say, where's Gunter, my beautiful child that I love?
Jake:::Oh, never mind, I think he just wished to be Ice King?
Jake:::And for some drums, I guess? Yeah, this is fine.
Finn:::Whew.
Fern::: Hey, Finn... I'm not doing so good.
Finn:::Oh, no.
Fern:::Yeah...I just wish I could see the treehouse one more time.
Finn:::Yeah dude, of course! Let's go there right now.
Fern:::That's okay... Just promise to plant me there.
Jake:::You feel ready?
Jake:::Whoa.
Princess Bubblegum:::Hey, Finn.
Finn::: Excuse me. Hi, PB.
Princess Bubblegum:::I just wanted to come say... thank you for disobeying my orders this morning. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? 
Finn:::See you tomorrow.
Princess Bubblegum:::You're getting tall. Good night!
Jake:::Night, PB!
BMO:::That's the end.
Shermy:::I thought this story was about the end of Ooo.
BMO:::... Pretty much.
Shermy:::But what happened to Phil and Jake after that?
Beth:::Or Princess Bubblegum?
BMO:::Eh, y'know. They kept living their lives. Thank you for visiting the King of Ooo, goodbye.
Beth:::The king was very polite for a king, don't you think?
Shermy:::I wish we could find that little Fern tree, see if that story is true.
Beth:::The tree would be a big tree now. It's, like, a thousand years old.
Shermy:::Oh, a big tree... Hey! I know where that tree is! C'mon, Beth!
Finn:::I came pretty close to biting it back there. I never would have gotten out of there without your singing. It's amazing how strong that song was.
Jake:::Music is powerful, man. It speaks to a primal pit in our brains. It makes anyone wanna get up and get their knees goin', gotta get 'em pumpin' pumpin' pumpin'. Boompa-boompa-boom.
Finn::: What do you think, Music Hole?
Music Hole:::Jake's right. A good song can really wrap people up in a mood, better than any words alone could. Actually, I've been working on a new song myself. It's about a really specific feeling that's hard to describe. Would you like to hear it?
Jake:::Sure!
Finn:::Yeah!
Shermy:::Check it out, dude.
Beth:::Very pretty.
Beth:::Lift that sword, Shermy.
Shermy::: Oh, yeah!
