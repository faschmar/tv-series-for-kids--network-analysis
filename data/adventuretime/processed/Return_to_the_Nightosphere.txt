Finn:::Oh. Heh heh. What? Where are we?
Jake:::I dunno.
Finn:::What did we do last night?
Jake:::Mayhaps we drank juice of the Elder Toad.
Finn:::Eh, I doubt it. Yo, do you see this? We're in a cage! Do you think we, like, did something wrong?
Jake:::Yeah, right. When did we ever did wrong actions? Get real. 
Finn:::Who ya calling?
Jake:::I'm callin' BMO, see if he knows what happened.Junk... My new camera phone... Wait, c'mere!
Finn:::What?
Jake:::I guess I vid-taped a buttload of stuff on here.
Finn:::Play it for the clues within.
Jake:::Okay, play. 
Finn :::Did you take it yet?
Jake :::Recording.
Finn :::Okay, get a shot of the portal.
Finn :::Gonna go through this biz!
Jake :::Alright, let's do—
Finn:::Oh, no! What?!
Jake:::Battery crunked out.
Finn:::Dude, do you remember any of that mess?
Jake:::No, but I guess we're here on purpose?
Finn:::So we opened a portal to somewhere, but where? 
Nightosphere Jailer:::The Nightosphere.
Finn & Jake::: AHHHhhhh...
Nightosphere Jailer:::You're in the Nightosphere.
Finn:::Are you sure?
Nightosphere Jailer:::Uh, yes. You got thrown in jail. Look. 
Jake:::Look!
Finn:::Marceline's dad! We really are in the Nightosphere!
Nightosphere Jailer:::Up an' at em, people.Eveyone out of your cages. My shift is over, and no one's shown up, so...
Finn:::Whoa, wait. You're letting us go?
Nightosphere Jailer:::I mean... yeah, but not really. You're in the nightosphere, so...
Finn:::So what?
Jake::: Is there an outlet somewhere for this?
Finn:::Hey, c'mon! Just tell us how we can get back to our world.
Nightosphere Jailer:::You can't leave the Nightosphere. Not unless he let's you. 
Finn & Jake:::Marceline's dad.
Nightosphere Jailer:::Yeah, that's Hunson Abadeer. He runs this place.
Jake:::Hunson Abadeer?Alright.
Finn:::Well, dude, how do we talk to him?
Nightosphere Jailer:::You can't just talk to the boss. You gotta make an appointment.
Finn:::Yeah, but we don't even know why we're here!
Jake::: And what's up with this?
Nightosphere Jailer:::Ugh. Oh! Oh, oh, sick! You touched that stuff?!
Nightosphere Jailer:::Later, fools. 
Jake::: Hey! Hey! Is there an outlet anywhere? You guys...
Finn:::Maybe this is where they put all the dummy demons.Right, big guy? You're not so smart, right? Yeah...Let's go out that hole, man.
Jake:::Okay, get on.
Finn:::Mm-hm, mm-hm. Pretty neat.
Finn:::Whoa, look!
Demon dad::: Charlie, don't socialize with the smaller demons! They're dirty and stupid!
Charlie:::Daddy!
Finn:::What is that?
Jake:::I think it's like sentient blood mist.
Finn:::Cool.
Jake:::C'mon, let's see if anyone knows where Hunson Abadeer is.
Finn:::Alright, well, how about that dude? 
Jake:::Okay.
Finn::: Yo, bros! How do we talk to Hunson Abadeer?
Half Monster Demon::: The teller can help you. Get in my flipping belly, and I will transport you. My insides are habitable. You will not be digested.
Finn:::Bye, mister!Who's the teller? That guy? 
Boat Demon:::Okay, bozos, make room, make room, make room!
Small Demon:::Ouch! Come on!
Boat Demon:::Scooch over, fatty.
Small Demon:::I can't, dude. This outbox is packed tighter than my tummy tunnel when I can't make brown on the camping trips because of my anxieties and I have IBS also.Ow!
Finn:::Hey, guy, are you the teller?
Boat Demon:::No, no, no, this is the line to meet the teller.
Finn:::No, man, are you for real? How long's the wait?!
Boat Demon:::I dunno. I just like to row around on top of their heads.
Finn:::Bunk that!
Jake::: Hey, do you know about this?
Boat Demon:::I... ew, no.Sick.
Finn:::Why do we need to see the teller anyway? We just wanna see Hunson Abadeer and find out what happened to us!
Boat Demon:::The teller will get you in touch with Hunson Abadeer. We got systems down here. You gotta swim the proper channels, ya know?
Small Demon:::Youse ain't special! Youse gotta wait just like the rest of youse...Us.
Finn::: Where's the line start?
Boat Demon:::Oh... I dunno. The thing sorta governs itself.
Finn & Jake::: Tight!
Finn & Jake:::Ow!
Jake::: That guy stinks.
Finn::: Excuse me! Excuse me! Big man? Over here!
Big Demon:::Huh? What, me?
Finn:::Uh, yeah, how long have you been in line for?
Big Demon:::How... long? 
Finn:::Oh, butt traps. Jake, stretch us to the front.
All demons:::NO CUTTING!!!
Big Demon:::I will kill you with all my hopes and regrets!
Finn:::All right, dudes, chill! We'll wait! 
Finn:::I can't feel my legs.
Finn:::SAY SOMETHING!! Say something to me!!!
Jake:::I... can't. I got nothing to say anymore.
Finn:::Just make up words then!
Jake:::Bloobity bloo bloo blah blee blee blah. Shree shrah...
Jake:::Hey, check it out. We're at the front of the line.
Finn & Jake:::Woohoo!
Finn::: Yo, yo! We wanna talk to Abadeer!
Teller:::Wha... Huh?When your thingy comes up, Hunson Abadeer will see you through the door.
Finn::: 42 million?! What's the number on the door?
Jake:::41 million...We're next! Whew! Man, I thought I was gonna throw up!
Finn:::That's us!
Jake:::Yaaay!Nooooooo!
Finn:::I'm gonna lose it! Waaaaaaaaaaahhh... 
Jake:::Hey, do you know if there's an outlet anywhere?
Two-headed Demon:::No.
Jake:::Do you know what this is all about? 
Two-headed Demon:::No... gross.
Jake:::What's going on, buddy? You givin' up?
Finn::: I guess.
Jake:::You don't wanna just stick it out a little more?
Finn:::I don't know if my little boy heart can take it.
Jake:::Listen, Finn. Are you listening?
Finn:::Mm-hmm.
Jake:::Your heart may be small, but it's strong as a bull donk. And I know. You can wait through this line so we can meet Hunson Abadeer and find out why we're here, and why we're in a pile of banianials, 'cause you're a champ, OK?
Finn::: Ok.
Jake:::上手で頑張ってね ("Being that you are skilled you can do it!")
Finn:::Well, at least I can see the end of the line, I think. Let's wait the heck out of this line!
Jake:::That's it, champ.Hehehehe, you're pretty pumped up.
Finn:::I'm super pumped!
Cloud:::Does anyone need to go pee-pees?
Cloud:::Go ahead.
Finn:::Oh, yeah, we've got questions.
Jake::: Put your hand down, Finn!
Finn:::No way, dude, I got questions.
Finn:::What the hey, Jake!
Jake:::It's not answering questions, man. That thing is gonna bake our beans.
Finn::: Hey, bloodmist cloud! What happened to us? Why can't we remember any—? Oh, it's gone.
Jake::: Look.
Jake:::Ride me, partner. 
Finn:::Hey, cloud! Where's Abadeer? Whoa, look at all these paintings. I think this is Hunson Abadeer's house.
Hunson Abadeer:::Hey!
Finn:::Hunson Abadeer!
Hunson Abadeer:::How dare you chumps trespass here!
Jake:::We just wanna go home, man.
Finn:::Yeah, why'd you lock us up, Abadeer? When Marceline finds out about this, it's gonna stir up some heavy daddy-daughter issues.
Hunson Abadeer:::NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE!
Jake:::Ah, come on, man!
Hunson Abadeer:::NO ONE! NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE!
Hunson Abadeer:::Come with me, you juicy, little mortal soul!
Jake:::Finn!
Finn:::Oh, my lob, Jake! You found the portal!
Jake:::We don't want to hurt you, Abadeer. Just let us go.
Finn:::What the—?
Finn & Jake::: MARCELINE?!
Marceline:::I'm gonna close this portal.You're forbidden to come back to the Nightosphere!
Finn:::But Marcy, let us help you!
Marceline:::It's too late! Stay away from me, FOREVVVEEERRRR!!!! 
Finn:::Marceline's in trouble! We gotta go back and save her.
Jake:::Alright, but I'm gonna take a shower first.
