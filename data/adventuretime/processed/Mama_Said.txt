King Of Ooo::: There. Right there. See?
Finn::: Uhhh...Yeah. It's a small thing?
Jake::: Hey, do you have bigger chairs?
King Of Ooo::: Stools.
Jake:::Huh?
King Of Ooo::: They're stools; not chairs.
Jake:::Well can I have a bigger stool, then?
King Of Ooo:::Jake, stop interrupting!
Jake:::Sorry.
King Of Ooo:::Enhance!
Finn and Jake:::Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa!
Jake:::Looks like a mushroom. Someone throwing mushrooms?
King Of Ooo:::Yes, very good, it is a mushroom! Or a toadstool. That's why you're sitting on stools.
Finn and Jake::: Oh.
King Of Ooo:::See, you guys gotta trust me on this one, okay? I picked those stools for a reason. Trust my process! You can get up now.
Jake:::My legs.
King Of Ooo:::No, nobody's throwing mushrooms.I believe they're flying on their own. That's where you two come in.
King Of Ooo:::Okay, the flying mushroom came from that direction,so I want you two to head that way until you find one. A big one. and I want you to capture it, and bring it back.
Jake:::Why?
King Of Ooo:::Huh?
Jake:::Why?
King Of Ooo::: Trust my process.
Jake:::Okay, but why, though?
Finn:::Yeah, we're curious.
King Of Ooo:::I wanna ride it around instead of walking. I think people will respect me more.Hey. Hey, you, what's your name?
Dirt Beer Guy:::I'm Dirt Beer Guy.
King Of Ooo:::What would you think if you saw me on a giant flying mushroom? Dirt Beer Guy:::Boy, that'd really be somethin'.
King Of Ooo:::See? Don't fail on this one, boys.Don't you dare fail me.
Finn::: Actually, I'm kinda glad we're walking in this direction. We never walk in this direction.
Jake::: Hey, how long do you think capturin' a flyin' mushroom takes?
Finn::: Well we gotta find one first. 
Jake:::Yeah, that too. How long?
Finn::: Mm. An hour to capture, aaand, if we don't find him by dinner, we'll tell KOO to send out a Banana Guard patrol.
Jake:::Tell who?
Finn:::KOO.
Jake:::...King Of Ooo?
Finn:::Yeah.
Finn:::Did you notice he was wearing Princess Bubblegum's clothes?
Jake:::Yeah, that was sorta cool. But you know, PB just left her kingdom to 'im. And all her stuff, so what's that about?
Finn:::Hmm.
Jake::: I smell mushrooms.
Finn:::Yeah, good job, Jake.
Jake:::Check it out.Big enough for KOO's tiny heiny!
Finn:::Yeah, the only thing, though, is it's not flying.
Jake:::Mmm, yeah... 
Finn:::I guess we could just sit here... and wait for it to fly?
