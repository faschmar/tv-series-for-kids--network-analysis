Magic Man:::Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz. The waffle doll shall fall lest you eat the yellow dough.Bzzzzz... 
Jake::: Hmm.I'll... I'll finish this later.So tired. And also hungry...Maybe I should... eat some— 
Jake:::Huh? Uh...Huh. Hmm. Everything's made of... me.
Jake:::Pretty neat. I bet there's, like—like a cool city or something around here.
Jake:::Nice. Jake City. 
Jake Person:::Hi!
Jake:::Oh, uh, hi!
Jake Person:::Jake! How you doing, Jake?
Jake::: Uh, good, man! Good!
Jake:::Man, this place is awesome!Ooh!Cool dolls! They look like the rare antique kind. Maybe my kids will like them. Mm. Wonder what my kids are gonna have for dinner. Maybe pizza...
Jake:::Whoa-oh! Some kind of Jake-quake...
Goose:::Eh? Is that Jake?
Jake::: Hey there, um...
Goose:::C'mon, man! It's Goose! Your best friend, Goose!
Jake:::Oh, uh, of course! Goose!
Goose:::Aww, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, ya big goof! How long's it been? Two, three years?
Jake:::Let's see, uh...one, two, uh... I've never been here.
Goose::: "I've never been here." You've still got it, Jake.
Goose:::C'mon! Let's get you home. Everyone's waiting for you at the party.
Jake:::Eh—party?
Goose:::No. Par-tay!
Jake::: Do it again, Goose!
Goose:::Hey, Jake.
Jake:::Hey, what?
Goose:::Now that you're back, how 'bout that five bucks you still owe me?
Jake:::Uh, what five bucks?
Goose:::Cheeseburger cheesecake ring a bell?
Jake:::What—? What is that?
Goose:::Oh, oh, that. Don't worry about that. Do not—don't worry about that.
Jake::: Guess I'd better not worry about it.Hmm. I'm hungies, Goose.
Goose:::I think there's a leftover nacho basket or something in the fridge.
Goose::: Just a sec.Cold cut-and-nacho sandwiches!
Jake:::All right!Ow! Something's wrong, Goose. Jakey can't eat any of these nachos...but Jakey needs nachos! Aah!
Urchin:::Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake, the Mayor wants to see you straightaway.
Jake:::Alright, lad, show me the way! 
Finn:::Jake! Hey, I got a for-real important question::: do you like cereal in your cake? Jake?Hmm...Mm-mm-mm.
Urchin:::Mr. Mayor.
Mayor:::Urchin, thank you for your help. Help yourself to the herring cakes.
Urchin:::Right-o!
Mayor::: Hello, Jake. Thanks for making it.
Jake:::Heh. Okay.
Mayor:::Now look, we're at orange alert here. Below us are gathered the city's top minds.
Jake:::Hmm.
Mayor:::And they've noticed that our seismographic troubles have increased exponentially since your arrival.
Jake:::Mayor, uh, I want to meet these minds.
Mayor:::Here are some of the minds.
Scientist:::Jake, we want to perform some tests on you to discover the cause of the quakes.
Jake:::There's no need. I've got it figured out. The tremors are happening because Jake is hungry,and his stomach is growling. And the hungrier he gets, the worse the quakes will become.
Jake:::I'll prove it!
Scientists:::Huh?
Jake:::Mention a food item.
Scientist:::Omelet.
Jake:::What's in the omelet?
Scientist:::Chili! It's a four-egg chili omelet!
Scientist:::Watch out!
Scientist:::Analysis, Tim!
Tim:::It's too early to say; this evidence is anecdotal!
Jake:::Look, just let me stretch outside to get something to eat, and the quakes will stop.
Tim:::That doesn't sound very science-y.
Scientist:::No, but you have my permission to test your idea.
Erik Adamkinson:::I don't like that idea.
Scientists:::Huh?
Erik Adamkinson:::If Jake leaves, that would mean the utter destruction of our world. I believe that Jake is an extra-dimensional being, a Glob if you will, whose psychic field holds our world together. If he leaves, his flesh will reconfigure, and everything and everyone here will disappear completely!
Tim:::Oh, Erik Adamkinson, you're just a fringe scientist, well known to have a crackpot of crazy theories.
Erik Adamkinson:::Hm! Perhaps I am. And maybe I am wrong... but are you really willing to take that chance? We should imprison Jake immediately!
Jake:::What?! No way! The world's not gonna end just because I go get a bagel.
Mayor:::Seize him!
Jake:::Uh, peace! 
Jake:::Why?!
Mayor:::Finish him.
Jake::: Mm.Bagel.
Erik Adamkinson:::Don't worry, everybody. I will journey to Jake's Glob world, which, legend would have us believe, lies beyond the great sky-hole, and bring back the food of the globs to appease Jake's appetite, thus saving everybody.
Erik Adamkinson's father:::Wait! Wait!I want to go with you, Son!
Erik Adamkinson:::I-I'm sorry, Dad. Y-you can't; i-it's too dangerous. Your mind is unprepared.
Erik Adamkinson's father:::My son. 
Erik Adamkinson:::Huh?Yeah!
Erik Adamkinson:::There it is, the sky ho-o-o-o-ole!
Erik Adamkinson:::Phew! Oh, my stars! It's just as I envisioned! Almighty Jake Globs, I beseech your aid! Do you have bagels? Hello? Hmm. Maybe those aren't the true globs. Yeah, they're too ugly to be— 
Erik Adamkinson::: I thought you'd be beautiful. But you're not!You're hideous! Hideous! 
Finn::: BMO, resume.
Jake:::Spaghetti... 
Guard:::Don't!
Guards:::Huh?
Guard:::Hey, you're a le—
Jake::: Huh?
Jake:::Goose?
Goose:::Go.
Jake:::But—but what if Erik Adamkinson is right? What if you and all the Jake peeps disappear and I can't bring you back?
Goose:::Then you won't have to pay me back that five bucks.
Jake:::But—
Goose:::Go eat, Jake!
Finn:::Uh, Jake? What's going on, man? Feeling okay?
Jake::: Just getting a snack, Goose.Just getting a snack.
