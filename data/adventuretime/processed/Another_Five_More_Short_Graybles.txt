Cuber::: Oh, hello.Here for more graybles, I presume. Well you've come to the right computer-fable. Feast your eyes-mabel, on my holo-pyramid viewer and—Huh? What's that? Not in the mood for graybles, you say? Oh dear. You okay? Did something fatlabel happen to you?Oh, I see. You'd rather watch me buh-blabel a bird-house in my workshop.Hm. More of a grayble man by trade. But okay! Come on! 
Cuber:::Oh, hello again! As you can see, the bird-house is nearly complete! All that's left is where the door hole goes. But I can't remember.Hm. Door hole. Wait! I just remembered! My door hole solution lies in one of tonight's scheduled graybles! Would you mind I look through them to find it?OK!Yeey! Here we go!
Jake::: Hey, Jake Jr.You having fun at daddy's?
Jake Jr.:::Hm? Oh. Sure dad.
Jake:::OK. You seem kind of dump trucks.
Jake Jr.:::What?
Jake:::You know, "in the dumps."
Jake Jr.:::Oh, sorry. It's cool. I'm just thinking about the future, I guess. We're on, like, the bleeding edge of history. Everything ahead of us is totally unknown and there's no guarantee that things are going to be all right. It's exciting, but it's also pretty scary. You know?
Jake:::Sounds like my little baby girl wanna build a time machine!
Finn:::Ooooh!
Jake Jr.:::Guys, I don't—
Jake:::No, no, no. Leave it up to your daddy and uncle Finn!Yup.
Jake Jr.:::OK, you guys have fun! I'm gonna get some more juice.Mom has some weird taste in men. 
Finn::: Pssst. She's going back!
Jake::: Ding-ding!Scre-e-e-ech! 
Finn:::Hello? Oh! Is that the machine part that I ordered?
Jake::: You just gotta sign for it, to prove you accepted delivery. 
Finn::: Ac-cept-tance.
Jake Jr.:::Guys, I'm basically thirty. I'm not a little kid anymore!
Princess Bubblegum::: You're not a little kid anymore!
Cinnamon Bun::: WHY-Y-Y-Y!?
Princess Bubblegum:::Cinnamon Bun, you can't sleep with a night-light anymore. You're basically thirty—it's starting to bum everyone out.
Cinnamon Bun::: I can't handle this denial of light!!!
Princess Bubblegum:::Yeah, well—
Cinnamon Bun::: No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!Too dark.No! It's too bright!Ah! It's too dark!Oh. A-ha. OK. This is nice.
Banana Guards::: 
Cinnamon Bun:::Ah! Too dark! 
Banana Guard::: Hey, Cinnabun! 
Cinnamon Bun:::I—need—soft—light!Yeeargh!!
Ice King::: Yeeargh! How long has this been in here? I don't even remember buying this. Oh well—easy come, easy go.Goodbye! Well, that wasn't so bad.Hm. 
Ice King::: Ah! Nothing like a hard day's work to get them spirits a-lifted! 
Ice King::: Great news, fellas! I finished all my chores, so we can start movie night early. Take your sits and will reveal the nominees. We got "Baby Ballet," "Blimby's "WHO GOTS DA ABC'S"," "Airplanes Taking Off," —Oh, wait! What's this one? "Basic Mortality::: Season 1"!? Isn't this that show that everyone is talking about? I heard that this show is really good for penguins. Wow, that's really lucky for you guys, I'm a little jealous. Well anyway, good luck to all our nominees! OK, all in favor of "Blimby's "WHO GOTS DA ABC'S""—raise your hands.
Ice King:::OK, all in favor of "Baby Ballet"—raise your hands.
Ice King:::OK, all in favor of Air—What!? "Baby Ballet"? Come on! Ugh! I should have never given you penguins the right to vote. Well, you may have numbers on your side, but I still have one trick up my sleeve. Bargaining. Whereby, you let me watch "Basic Mortality," and I in return will do anything you want in the whole world. How 'bout it?
Middle Penguin:::Wenk.
Ice King:::Algebraic!
Man:::I know he was your partner.
Woman:::Enough! Alan is not the super-murderer!
Ice King:::I don't know about this show though—
Man:::This, captain, is the most lamentable super-murder I've ever seen—and I've seen plenty.
Ice King:::—might be a touch too dark.
Cinnamon Bun::: Too dark!Too bright! 
Lemongrab 2::: Eat on it!

Lemongrab 2::: Hm.
Lemongrab 2:::Oh, little Lemon-Sweets, our son.So precious. You enjoy sitting in your chair?What would you like to do now?Go to bed.
Lemongrab:::No, he wants to dance!

Some bums let him have it 'cause it was so ugly.And check out these classic stylings. They don't make 'em like this anymore!Wow! Haha!

Mr Fox:::What the—?Oh, no! My riches!
Cinnamon Bun:::Let me in!It's too—bright!Too dark!
Mr. Fox:::Cinnamon Bun, you!Did a great job, on this hole wall. It's very rustic. 
Sub-conscious Mr. Fox:::M-m-m-m, what a jerk.
Finn:::What, a jerk?
Jake:::Yeah, just give it a little jerk.
Finn:::Now that's a time machine.
Jake:::Hey, sweetie! Sweetie, look! Your time machine's all ready!
Jake Jr.:::Aw yeah, you havin' fun, dad?
Jake:::Aw, anything for my baby pup.
Jake Jr.:::OK. As long as you're having fun.
Jake::: Time machine! 
Cuber:::Ha-ha! There it is! You see? The birdhouse door—it's right above the peg thingy. Why didn't I think of that?Well, I guess that's it for this week. I'll see you crimpy glimmers on the—what?
