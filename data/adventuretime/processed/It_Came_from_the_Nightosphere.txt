Marceline::: Thanks for helping me record, Finn.
Finn::: No problem, Marceline.
Marceline::: Now, I'm gonna sing something really personal, so don't laugh at me.
Finn::: I would never dream of it... m'lady. 
Marceline::: Now, start a slow beat, and keep it steady, or it'll mess up everything.
Finn::: You got it!
Marceline::: Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up!
Finn::: Marceline, if you're thinkin' about your dad so much, then... why don't you go see 'im?
Marceline:::He's not worth the effort.
Finn::: Not worth what effort?
Marceline::: Well... first, I'd have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then... uh... douse it with bug milk.
Finn:::Oh, yeah?! 
Marceline:::And then you're supposed to chant something like , "Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum."But... I-I don't really wanna see him. I'm still mad about the thing with the fries.Huh?!
Finn::: Wwwwhhhat?!Whoa... whoa!! Aaagh!!
Lord of Evil::: Marceline!
Marceline::: Finn... what the heck did you do?!
Finn::: I... reunited you with your family?
Lord of Evil::: Is this kid your evil servant?
Finn::: I'm not evil, Marceline's dad. I'm super good!
Lord of Evil::: "Super good?" 
Finn:::What're you doing?!
Lord of Evil::: Stealing your soul.
Marceline::: Dad!Ugh! You always do stuff like this!
Lord of Evil::: Haha! Oh, Marceline! I never know what's gonna set you off! Whoa! Is this the family ax?
Marceline::: Wha—? HEY!!!
Lord of Evil::: Did you turn it into some kind of lute?
Marceline:::Give it back, and get out!!!
Lord of Evil::: Okay, I'll go. I've got business to attend to, anyway—sucking up all the souls in Oooooo...
Finn:::WHA—Gh—NO!!
Lord of Evil::: See you kids later! 
Marceline::: My bass!
Finn::: I've unleashed evil onto Ooo ! We've gotta stop 'im, Marceline!
Marceline::: Fine... but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back.
Finn::: Hey! How do I kill this guy, anyway?
Marceline::: Finn! You can't kill my dad!
Finn::: Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean—
Marceline::: No! You literally can't kill my dad! He's deathless!
Finn::: Oh...
Fluffy Person:::Huh?Who the fluff are you?
Lord of Evil::: Um... Well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul.
Fluffy Person::: Good 'cause that's, like, my number one fear.
Lord of Evil::: Really!? Well... I know a little exercise for that! Wanna try??
Fluffy Person::: Wow...
Lord of Evil::: First... close your eyes.
Fluffy Person::: Okay!AAH! You coulda killed me!
Lord of Evil::: Ah, but I didn't! And now, aren't you thrilled just to be alive?
Fluffy Person::: Yeah, I guess... So what?
Lord of Evil::: So... This next part will be all the more... horrifying. 
Finn::: There!! Below us! A gathering of Fluffy People! May-haps they've seen your father! Marceline... release the Finn-bomb!They're all freaked out!
Marceline::: It's because they're scared of him.Hm. My dad's been here. Come on. Let's go.
Finn::: No! We gotta help this guy. I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me. You like, uh, collard greens or country-fried steak?
Marceline::: Look. You wanna help him? Help me get my bass back.
Finn::: How will that help hi—?
Marceline::: MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!! And when I get it back... I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!
Finn::: Oh, clam! But first you gotta return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad, little husks. Right, Marceline?
Marceline:::Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, we'll do that.
Head Marauder::: So I popped his head like a cork! And I says, "That's what I think of Expanding Earth Theory!"
Lord of Evil::: Alright.
Marauders::: Huh?!
Lord of Evil::: I've got a joke, too.What wears a dark suit, is completely evil, and is about to suck out all your souls?
Head Marauder::: Yo mama!
Lord of Evil:::That's right! I'm your mama! 
Marceline::: Red Rock Pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains, he'll have to come through here.
Finn::: We can work together! And smash 'im with this rock! And once he's smooshed, all the souls will go back to their rightful bods.
Lord of Evil::: So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh?
Marceline:::Daddy...
Lord of Evil:::Karate kick!! 
Finn::: Marceline!! Keep 'im right there!! HrrrrRAAAAGH!!!
Lord of Evil::: Karate chop!!You can't destroy me!
Marceline:::No... D-dad... I-I don't wanna destroy you...Look, just... stay out of my life!! 
Lord of Evil::: You're not even alive!
Finn::: You blew it, dude. We're supposed to be a team—a team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin'-souls... ball.
Marceline:::I just want my dad to care about me.
Lord of Evil::: Of all history's greatest monsters, you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered. Offer your soul to me, dark one.
Gunter::: Wenk wenk.
Lord of Evil::: NO! You can't have my soul! I don't even...! Look, just get in here.
Gunter::: Wenk wenk.
Lord of Evil:::Keep your crummy soul!
Ice King::: Gunter! Who told you you could fly?!
Gunter:::Wenk.
Ice King::: Huh? No one sucks the life from my penguins except me! ...And maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter.You darest encroach upon my domain?!You've raised my frosty dander! And for that, I shall—AAAAAOOOOOHHH!! I've soiled my tunic... completely by choice! 
Lord of Evil::: YES!!
Finn::: Aw, man! He's growing huge!
Finn::: I'm gonna take 'im down!
Marceline::: Finn, you're like an ant to him.
Finn::: Oh, yeah? Well, this ant's about to get in his pants!
Marceline:::What?
Finn:::You know!Because I'm going to make him uncomfortable while I release those souls! RAAAAAAAAGH!!!Give up those souls, Marceline's dad! In the name of justice!!
Lord of Evil::: Huh?Oh, Marceline. Still following me?
Marceline::: I'll stop following you if you give me back my guitar!
Lord of Evil:::No, Marceline.
Finn:::NO ONE FLICKS ME IN THE BUTT WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!!Whoooaa!!The souls... Lumpy Space Princess! He got your soul, too?!
Lumpy Space Princess::: What? Nah. I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here, and I wasn't invited?! I was all, "What the lump?" so I'm crashin' this party!
Finn::: Well, I'll save you... I'LL SAVE ALL OF YOU!!
Marceline::: IN YOUR FACE, DAD!
Lord of Evil::: Give back that ax, Marceline! You don't respect it enough!
Marceline::: Well... you don't respect anything! Dad!! DAD!! I'm outta here!
Finn::: BUT—!!
Lord of Evil::: Fine!! Go!! I'm too busy sucking to deal with you!
Finn::: NO, WAIT! Marceline!! Keep talking to 'im! When he's talking, he can't steal souls!!
Marceline::: I said I'm outta here!
Finn:::Diversion... need... diversion. 
Lumpy Space Princess::: Oh, my Glob, you guys! Drama bomb!
Lord of Evil::: Marceline, do you really feel this way?
Marceline::: Dad, I...
Lord of Evil::: Marceline... of course I love you.
Marceline::: Dad...
Lord of Evil::: I'm sorry I ate your fries. I didn't mean to hurt you.
Marceline::: It's okay, Dad. It's... it's really okay.
Lord of Evil::: No, it's not okay. They weren't even very good. They were really cold. I love you, Marceline. Don't you ever doubt that.
Marceline::: I love you, too, Dad.

Finn::: MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM!!I'll see you in the Nightosphere, ya sick freak.YES!!!!
Marceline::: Finn!! How could you do that?!
Finn::: How could I... save the day?
Marceline::: How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?!
Finn::: How could I embarrass-save you??WHOA! Marceline!
Marceline:::I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere. That was emotionally exhausting.
Finn::: I'm also exhausted emotionally. Or... wait. I mean, I mean physically.
Marceline::: I've been meaning to ask you... What's with that pocket on your shirt?
Finn::: Oh, Jake's in here. 'Sup, Jake?
