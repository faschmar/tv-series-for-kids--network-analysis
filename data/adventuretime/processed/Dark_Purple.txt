BMO::: Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Sick! Sick! So sick! Dying!
Finn:::Check it out. I got snacks for while we wait. For Marcy, red lick-rish.
Marceline:::Thanks.
Finn:::And for BMO... 
BMO:::Fresh boys!
Marceline:::So, Finn...What are we waiting here for?
Finn:::What? Dude, it's Super Porp Day.
Jake:::Yeah. Don't you know about Super Porp Day?
Marceline:::Wait. "Super Porp"... like in the old commercials? Uh, let's see, like, Super Porp, it hits the spot, messes up your train of thought. If you're thirsty and out of shape...
Everyone:::Get down on that fizzy grape!
Finn:::Yeah, yeah. That's the one.
Jake:::Today's the day when Squeez-E-Mart always gets their monthly shipment.
Marceline:::What? That's really weird, guys. Why would s—
BMO:::Stop talking! Here it comes!
Cheryl (recording):::Enjoy Super Porp!
BMO:::I love you, Cheryl.
Marceline:::Man, this biz takes me back. I used to drink this stuff all the time when I was a kid.
Finn:::What? That's not right. How could the exact same soda still be in production hundreds of years after the great Mushroom Wars?
Jake::: Okay, listen. So, okay, we could go track down the mysterious source of Super Porp. Do up a fuh-real, end up fightin' some big soda-computer-god-baby or whatever... We totally could. But... Super Porp is good. So why question this good thing, man? Why?
Finn:::Hmm. Yeah, okay. Let's just go home.
BMO:::Yay! Super Porp! Yay! BMO!
Hyoomans::: Super Porp! Super Porp! Super Porp!
Cheryl:::Enjoy Super Porp!
Hyoomans:::We will, Cheryl!
Susan Strong:::No, Cheryl. Susan will not enjoy!
Rabbit Hyooman:::Chill out, Susan Strong.
Giraffe Hyooman:::Yeah. Super Porp taste good! Super Porp is good!
Susan Strong:::No. It fake juice. Tough-guy hyoomans do not drink fake juice.
Susan:::Hmph.Go away, robots!
Mother::: Baby? Baby!
Susan Strong:::Eh?! Baby!Baby!
Susan:::Baby.
Susan::: Oh, dang! 
Susan:::Baby.
Celina:::Porp fountain.
Susan:::Hmm?
Susan:::Hmm?Cheryl.Where's baby? Cheryl better talk. 
Cheryl:::Hello, and welcome to the original Super Porp factory!Are you ready to get porrrped? I-I-I think we all need to get poooorped.
Susan::: Baby!
Celina:::Susan killed Cheryl!
Susan::: No!This is fake style bubblehead. Cheryl trying to trick us!
Susan::: Baby! That hole too small for Susan.
Susan:::If Sally say so...Hup! Hyah!
Susan:::You two, follow baby cries.
Susan:::Susan will find other way. Hmm?Hmm... 
Workers:::Super Porp, it hits the spot. It messes up your train of thought. If you're thirsty and out of shape, get down on that fizzy grape! Super Porp!
Susan:::Uh.
Female Worker:::Hey! No one is allowed to taste pure Porp syrup! You know this, Carla.
Carla:::But it looks sooo good!
Female Worker:::Well, of course it does! I mean, I'd smash everyone's face in this room for a single drop of pure Porp, but that's not the Super Porp way.
Female Worker:::Aw, cheer up, girl. Maybe we'll get bonus reg Porp after that new baby gets processed.
Susan:::Baby!
Male Worker:::Hey, where's your hairnet?!
Male Worker:::Ow! W-w-where's your hairnet? Where's your hairnet?
Male Worker:::Where's your—?
Male Worker:::Okay, verbal warning this time.
Female Worker:::Protect the pure Porp!
Worker:::Uh-oh. Uh-oh.Uh-oh!
Worker:::Oof! Uh-oh. 
Worker:::Uh-oh!
Worker:::Uh-oh!
Susan:::Now you tell Susan where you take baby or I'm—
Female Worker:::Hey, are you new here? Are you new here? Are you new here?
Cheryl:::Attention! All employees report to the break room for the daily Porp break... sponsored by Super Porp.
Susan:::Baby.
Workers:::Break time. Break time.
Susan:::Susan is camouflaged.
Male Worker::: If you're thirsty and out of shape, get down on that fizzy grape.
Susan::: Why is Susan in this line? Susan didn't think this through.
Male Worker:::Wait.That poorly disguised intruder is covered in pure Porp!
Workers:::Pure Porp! Pure Porp! Pure Porp!
Male Worker:::Lick the syrup from her eye holes!
Giant Mutant:::Get down on that fizzy grape!
Susan:::Susan needs no fizz! Susan have hero heart!
Cheryl:::Break time, sponsored by Super Porp, is over. Get back to work. The Porp must flow!
Workers:::The Porp must flow! The Porp must flow!
Susan:::Ugh. It's sticky.
Susan:::You a good doggy? You know where baby is? Doggy help Susan?
Susan:::No!
Susan:::Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Susan:::Baby! Hold on, baby!
Dog::: Huh?
Cheryl:::Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.Hey. How's it going?
Celina:::Cheryl?
Susan:::Susan hates Cheryl!
Cheryl:::So... you're the dinguses who trashed my facility.
Susan:::Yes. Susan is the dingus. Now gimme the baby!
Cheryl:::Oh, I see. You don't understand what's going on. This is a super spesh baby, a destiny baby, selected by my loyal delivery drones to take my place as high mascot Cheryl.For you see—
Susan:::Don't drink that.
Cheryl:::Good job, bozo. Without a new Cheryl, brand awareness will go straight down the toilet. Our in-your-face flavor will be lost forever. Who are you to condemn our weird ancient ways? 
Susan:::Stop!
Worker:::Cheryl?
Susan:::Yes, I am Cheryl. 
Workers:::Huh?
Susan:::And Cheryl says this is what we do now. Back to work! Everybody, destroy the factory!
Workers:::Destroy the factory. Back to work. Destroy the factory. Back to work.
Jake:::Alright, well, it's one month later. Aw, yeah! Here it comes!
Cheryl:::Enjoy Super Porp!
Jake:::Ugh! I jinxed it!
