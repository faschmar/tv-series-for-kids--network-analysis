Jake:::Beep beep! Look out! Beep beep! Pillow delivery! Look out buddy! 
Finn::: Uuf! 
BMO::: Uuf!
Finn::: Come on, Jake...
Jake::: Sorry buddy,just trying to cheer you up some. I mean here you are chillin' out with history's coolest friends, building an actual pillow fort, but you just sit there sulking--I mean, what gives!?
Finn:::I guess I'm just thinking about Flame Princess. I told her a joke the other day and she didn't even laugh or anything. I guess it's over between us.
Jake::: That's it?! A joke?
BMO::: Maybe she just didn't get it yet.
Finn::: Yeah right, BMO. More like she used up all her laughs on some other guy's jokes probably. Man, having a girlfriend is hard.
Jake::: No! Being crazy is hard. You're getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems. You gotta focus on what's real, man.You see this cup? This is literally my favorite cup.Now it's gone forever. So it's not real, and I don't care about it anymore.
BMO:::Oh no! My favorite window!
Finn::: I don't even know what you guys are talking about. I think I just need some alone time.Gotta let my mind fester a bit, you know? I'll be back in a little while. 
Jake:::Finn! Festering is always bad, man! There's no good kind of festering! Finn!
Finn::: Man, this looked smaller from the outside. What's this now? What the?! Jake, what's in here?! Jake?
Finn::: Oh, whoa!Did Jake build this part too? That guy needs some more girlfriends or something.
Finn:::Hey Jake! You need more girlf--what the...? Door's gone?
Finn::: Hmm, maybe there's another door in yonder pillow town.I don't get this at all.
Pillow children::: Dragon!! Blanket Dragon! Run!
Finn::: Huh?
Pillow child:::Oof! Hey mistah, you betta get wunnin'! Bwanket Dwagon!
Finn::: Now this, I understand! Oh. That's it?
Pillow child::: Wow.
Pillow people:::Did you see that?
Finn::: Hey, uh, how's it going?
Quilton::: Puhoy there! I am Quilton, son of Pillowford, and you have saved our village! You and your sharp pillow.
Finn::: Hah, it's nothing; I kill things all the time.
Quilton::: Oh, nonsense! This calls for a celepillowbration!
Pillow people::: 
Finn::: 
Roselinen::: There you are, Finn the Human.
Finn::: Oh, hey there... Um, you can just call me Finn if you want.
Roselinen::: All right, Finn. My name is Roselinen, daughter of Quilton. You have to call me the whole thing.
Finn::: Oh, uh...
Roselinen::: Just kidding!
Finn::: Heh. Oh, uh, your dad seems fun.
Quilton::: Oh, ha ha, oh my! Puhzah!
Roselinen:::Yeah. Um, you wanna dance?
Finn::: Oh, well...I...have a girlfriend. 
Roselinen:::Dummy, it's a dance, not marriage.
Finn:::Yeah, okay!This place is weird.
Roselinen:::Are you telling me that birds in your world don't poo little pillowcases?
Finn::: Naah, just regular poo.
Roselinen::: Hey, like this. 
Finn::: Eh, yeah, i-it's really cool. Where I come from, I live with my best friend, who's my brother. And he's a dog. We fight stuff; it's cool. It's really different than here. I mean, where I'm from, blankets and pillows are used for bedding.
Roselinen:::Well they're used for that here too.
Finn:::Heh heh uh.
Quilton::: Woo oo ooh hoo hoo! Pill-ightful!
Finn::: Ah man, it's been nice, Roselinen. But I gotta get back to my home.Quilton, I need your help to find a portal to my home world.
Quilton::: Of course, we will do our best to help you, Finn the Flesh Pillow. But you're not making a fold of sense!
Quilton::: Please, share our food. You need nourishment.
Finn:::It tastes... like... a pillow...
Quilton::: I'll give your compliments to the pillow.
BMO::: Oh, there you are! You found your mug. I thought you said you didn't care.
Jake::: 
BMO::: That mug is empty.
Jake::: I wonder what Finn's up to...
Jay:::Roar! I'm the Blanket Dragon!!
Bonnie:::Well, I'm daddy! Sha-pow!
Roselinen::: Jay, Bonnie. I bet your dad's just about finished chopping wool. You guys wanna bring him his lunch?
Jay & Bonnie::: Yes!
Finn:::Alphanumeric!Pillow sheep! You have more fluff than sense! 
Jay & Bonnie::: Daddy!
Finn::: Oh!What is this!A pack of fearsome pillow goblins?!
Bonnie:::Ha ha, daddy, we're your kids!
Roselinen::: Psst, Finn, they've brought you lunch.
Finn::: Oh, they have, have they?Tiny pillows. Mmm mmm mm mmm.
Jay::: 
Finn:::Darling, you've outdone yourself.
Quilton:::Honk, honk!
Jay & Bonnie::: Grandpillow!
Roselinen::: What's my father doing here?
Quilton::: Puhoy!
Jay & Bonnie::: Grandpillow!
Quilton::: Oh oh oh, come here! Oh, but I've come to speak with your father.
Finn::: What is it, Quilton?
Quilton::: When you first arrived here, you told us of a mysterious door that led you to our world.
Finn::: Yes, of course.
Quilton::: Archaeologists found this in the Pillow Catacombs:::The Pillownomicon.
Finn::: Oh my glob.
Quilton::: There is no information about the door, save for the fact it shows up periodically, and then disappears.
Finn::: Quilton, I need to find that door. 
Jake::: Uhhh, hey BMO, I gotta snag my mug from you. 
BMO::: Oh, really?
Jake::: Hey don't sweat it, I'll make us some hot chocolate.
BMO::: Jake, you drive a hard burger.
Finn:::Hello?
Rasheeta::: Ah yes, come in.
Finn::: Are these The Great Abracadabra Mountains? And are you Rasheeta the Great Oracle, dweller of said mountains?
Rasheeta::: Yes, you must be Finn the Human Man, seeker of the wandering portal.
Finn::: Yes, I've searched for decades--how did you know?
Rasheeta::: I've read it in the Tea Leaves,this newspaper I found from the future.
Finn::: Does it say how I get home?
Rasheeta::: The real question is::: are you sure you want to?
Finn::: Uh... yeah!
Rasheeta::: Well don't worry, you won't be here long. 
Finn::: So there is another way to...Oof...
Rasheeta::: Not long now. 
Finn::: Oh... 
Bonnie::: Father?
Jay::: What did the oracle say, father? Have we come to the right spot finally?
Finn::: I think so, but the oracle spoke in riddles.Gonna have to fester on this one for a bit...
Roselinen::: Oh, Finn. I know you have to go, all these years I've known, but now that it's time...Oh man, I'm just all messed up about it. Just promise me you'll remember us,when you're back in your real life.
Finn::: Hmm, that reminds me, Roselinen, of something Jake told me just before I came to this world.
Jake:::You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems, stay with your new wife. You've known her longer now than any of us. You're not even sure if I ever really existed. And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like this.
Finn:::Man. How did he see it all coming so clearly?Come on, everyone. Pack your things, we're going home.
BMO:::Ha ha he, ha ha he, goodness, Jake, why don't you do this with your other babies?
Jake::: Well, Rainicorn babies age rapidly. They don't need their parents a couple hours after they're born.
BMO::: That really stinks, huh?
Jake::: Mmmmm.
BMO::: Hot chocolate is ready!
Roselinen::: Finn... Finn.
Finn:::Wha—where?
Roselinen::: Are you comfortable?
Finn::: I'm... alright.
Bonnie::: Um, dad...dad. We.. just.. wanted to say... that we-- 
Jay::: That... we love you dad.
Finn:::I remember... back... when I was dad.
Jay:::  Dad, you are dad...
Finn:::  I ain't dad yet! Oh, no, wait! Here it comes! Woo hoo hoo hoo hooooo, BOY! 
Finn::: HUP! 
Jake::: Hey buddy, you feeling better already?
Finn::: Huh? Oh. Uhh, I don't know, man. I just had the number one wildest dream.
Jake::: Really?
Finn::: Yeah! I was--Hello? Oh hey! Oh.Yeah, thanks! Yeah, okay, bye.That was Flame Princess. She said she didn't get my joke until just now and that it's really funny and awesome!
BMO:::. Ha ha! I knew it!
Jake::: Yeah, that's great man. Now what about this dream?
Finn::: What dream?
Jake::: The dream you were just talking about.
Finn::: Huh?
Jake::: Just a second ago!
Finn::: 
Jake::: The dream you just had in the pillow fort!
Finn:::  Pfft!
