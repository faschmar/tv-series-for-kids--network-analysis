Jake:::Nice. Little bird family on vacay. Dad's got the mad beautiful tail feathers; Mommy's taking up the rear all plain-jane styles.Hehe. Glad I get to date a beautiful rainicorn, not some nasty bird. 
Bird:::Hey! Don't be talking trash! Our ladies are beautiful on the inside, you creep.
Jake:::All lady birds around the whole world are beautiful on the inside?
Bird:::Yes.
Jake:::Fair enough.
Bird:::Special delivery for Jake the Dog.
Jake:::Cool, thanks.Urgent.
Jake:::Hold still, BMO.
BMO:::Ouch. I hurt my butt sledding.
Jake:::Aw dang. Sorry, BMO.Cool, man, I'm excited!
Jake::: What the heck am I looking at?
Jake::: Jake Jr.?! What's going on here?
Kidnapper:::Jake the Dog, we have your daughter. She is safe—for now.
Jake:::What do you want from me?!
Kidnapper:::We need you to reassemble your old team—Gareth, a.k.a. The Lady Master, the Flying Lettuce Brothers, notorious con-men impressionists and your old friend, Tiffany.
Jake::: Glob it.
Kidnapper:::You'll need them to break in the Royal Candy Vault and steal this.
Jake:::The Baker's Shard—the purest source of sugar in the known regions.
Kidnapper:::You're the only master thief with the skills to swipe it. You have until midnight to make the drop. Tell anyone and Jake Jr. gets it. 
Jake::: BMO, destroy the tape.
Jake:::Are we on the level, BMO?
BMO:::I ain't no clown-town snitch, baby.
Jake:::I don't want Finn hearing about this.
BMO:::Alright.
Lollipop girl::: Oh Branard, you sure?
Gareth:::Yup babe, I'm totally famousand you love me.
Lollipop girl:::Wha—what is going on? What am I feeling now?
Gareth:::You are now under the spell of my face. I got you, girl, in my face trap and you love it.
Lollipop girl:::I do. Branard, don't ever leave me! I'll give you everything—my fabric, my dress patterns, my marbles, my social standing— 
Gareth::: Woops! I gotta go! Laters!
Candy butler:::Dine and dash? I saw that!
Tonya:::Hey boss, I wanted to—
Squeeze-E-Mart boss:::Shut up Tonya, I gotta see my ex-wife! 
Tonya:::Uh.
Tonya::: Hello, Squeez-E-Mart.
Flying Lettuce Brothers::: Tonya, this is your boss!
Tonya:::Wait, you were just here.
Flying Lettuce Brothers:::Yeah, and now I'm on the phone, stupid!
Tonya:::Hey, do you think I can leave early? I'm like, depressed.
Flying Lettuce Brothers:::What you could do is take all the money from the register and give it to the two guys out back by the dumpster.
Tonya::: OK. Can then I go?
Flying Lettuce Brothers:::Yes. 
Tonya::: Here you go dudes.
Flying Lettuce Brother:::Thanks, man. 
Tonya::: Peace.
Flying Lettuce Brothers:::Goodbye, fair lad.The master returns.
Tiffany:::Well, well. From the shadows of dream, the dog wakes to find its—ugh——the dog wakes to find its mangy tail flopping in the dust like a fish in a tree. That fish is me! Tiffany!I'm coming Jake, I'm coming!]
Jake::: Oh, hi guys. Were you waiting for me in the dark?
Gareth:::Tiffany wouldn't let us turn them on.
Tiffany:::Never mind that, the real question is what's that slo-mo Finn know about this?
Finn:::Hey BMO, where's Jake?
BMO:::Jake got back with his old gang and is going to rob the Candy Kingdom!
Finn::: OK, BMO.
Finn:::You wanna join my primitive noise band? 
BMO:::No, I like organized sound.
Finn:::Pssssh! 
Jake:::Nah, BMO's covering for me.
Flying Lettuce Brothers:::So what's the deal, Jake?
Gareth:::Yeah, why did you call us back?
Jake:::I got a job for you guys.One last score. The Big one.
Gareth:::The Baker's Shard?Are you for real, man?
Flying Lettuce Brothers:::This is crazy Jake, we always said::: "Play it safe."
Tiffany:::Can't ya see guys, he's desperate! Somebody got to him 'cause he's soft now.
Jake:::What? Psssh! Tiffany! I'm the same Jake, I just stopped stealing mostly! 'Cause when you get older you're supposed to get in other stuff, like graphic design, or pottery. It's called "growing up"!
Gareth:::I don't want to do poetry—I mean, pottery.
Jake:::Dude, you guys on board or what?! You really got something better to do?! I know you don't, Tiffany!
Tiffany::: Glom you, Jake.
Flying Lettuce Brothers:::How are gonna split the Baker's Shard?
Jake:::We ain't keeping it.I'm passing the shard off to a mystery dude.
Tiffany::: What the—?!
Jake:::The dude has my kid.My Little Jake Jr. 
Gareth:::I'm in.
Flying Lettuce Brothers:::We're in.
Tiffany:::I know that vault inside and out! Every guard rotation, every camera, every deadly trap. And that safe is locked up so tight it makes me wanna spit out my guts and cry about it. Do you even have a plan, Jake?!
Jake:::I have the first part.OK, let's freakin' do this!
Private Banana Guard::: Captain, the milk delivery has arrived.
Captain Banana Guard:::Well, check 'em in, Private.
Private Banana Guard:::Yes, sir! 
Captain Banana Guard:::And Private, I'm very thirsty! Bring me back the most delicious flavor they have!
Private Banana Guard:::Yes sir! 
Captain Banana Guard:::Huh? Now what in the heck—?!
Private Banana Guard:::I got your milk, sir!
Captain Banana Guard:::What flavor did you bring me, Private?
Flying Lettuce Brothers::: Banana, sir!
Captain Banana Guard:::What?
Gareth:::Banana milk! 
Captain Banana Guard::: The forbidden flavor! It's—delicious.
Flying Lettuce Brothers::: It's—it's—it's—it's—delicious!Attention all guards! You are directed to report immediately to the courtyard for special training!
Jake::: OK, do your thing, man.
Tiffany::: Just like old times, right, Jake? When we were blood, we'd follow each other in the jaws of death on a pale horse.
Jake:::Not now, Tiffany! Come on! 
Flying Lettuce Brothers::: Tonight we'll be working on our battle "kee-yahs." Alright men, sound off!
Flying Banana Guards::: Alright soldiers, time to shred those pipes! I wanna hear you scream!
Flying Banana Guard:::Louder! Push it hard!
Tiffany and Jake::: 
Tiffany:::The Baker's Shard is on the other side of—that. The Corridor of a Thousand Deaths.
Jake:::I did it! For Jake Jr.! 
Kidnapper:::Stop right there.
Jake:::You! Where's my daughter?!
Kidnapper:::Throw me the Baker's Shard—and I'll let her go.
Jake:::Yeah right, that's super-dumb.
Jake Jr.:::Daddy! Please do what he says!
Jake:::Hang on, sweetie! 
Flying Lettuce Brothers::: Thank you for saving me—
Tiffany, Gareth and the Flying Lettuce Brothers:::—daddy! 
Jake::: You dirty—
Tiffany:::Now—ugh——I'm the dog, and you're the tail! Now you chase me! You chase my dreams! 
Tiffany:::Oh crud! Jake, I love you! I love youuu!
Jake:::Shut it, Tiffany!Gimme my daughter.
Jake Jr.:::TADA! I totally double-crossed you!
Jake:::Jake Jr.?! WHAT THE PUKE, GIRL?! 
Gareth:::Let's get out of here!
Jake:::What the funky fresh, honey?
Jake Jr.:::I just wanted to be like you. Mom told me stories about when you did crimes.
Jake:::That was a long time ago. Before I knew it was wrong!
Jake Jr.:::I thought you'll be proud of me.
Jake:::I am. I couldn't have done that when I was your age.
Jake Jr.:::I age fast remember? I'm twenty-two!
Jake:::R-r-r-right. I keep forgetting maths.
Jake Jr.:::What are you going to do about the old crew?
Jake:::Finn and I bust their apples tomorrow. Or maybe the Banana Guards will get 'em.
Jake::: Come on. I'll take you home now.
Jake Jr.::: I love you, pops.
Jake:::I love you, too. Don't stinkin' do this to me again. I'm old and fat. I'll probably have a heart attack.
Jake Jr.:::OK.
Jake::: Wait a minute! You're doing a long con right now, aren't you?
Jake Jr.:::No.
Jake Jr.:::Yes.
Jake:::Now I'm really proud of you!
