Finn:::Eww! The sea lard’s in my bed again. Gross.
Jake:::Dude. That’s like the 8th time. Why don’t you just get rid of it?
Finn:::I don’t know what’s gotten into it lately.
Jake:::It's gross as butts, man. We’re taking care of this right now.
Finn:::I can’t believe we never thought of this before. The pond is the perfect place for a sea lard.
Jake:::See ya larder!
Jake::: Huh.
Finn:::Is he, like, okay?
Shelby:::Well, seeing as sea lards are saltwater fish, and the pond is a freshwater environment… ...no? He’s a stenohaline fish. Haven’t you guys ever heard of osmoregulation? Allow me to explain.
Shelby::: Waaaa! 
Finn:::Sorry Shelby. Gotta save the lard.
Jake::: Thar!
Finn::: Wa?
Water Nymphs::: Smash the frogs, smash the frogs, making frog hot dogs, smash the frogs…..
Finn::: Whoa!
Water Nymph (Denise)::: Finn and Jake!Yo! Finn and Jake are here!
Water Nymphs #2 and #3:::Smash the frog -Hi!
Finn:::So, this is where you guys live?
Water Nymphs #2 and #3:::Yeah!
Water Nymph #2:::We’re the guardians of this grotto.
Water Nymph (Denise):::You guys want to stay for lunch? We’re making hot dogs!
Finn and Jake::: Hot dogs?!?!
Finn::: Oh, wait. We dropped our sea lard in the pond, and we’ve got to save it before it dies from the freshwater. He’s a stenohaline fish.
Water Nymph #3:::You do know sea lards are mammals, right?
Finn::: Uhh.. I definitely knew that.I’m gonna murder Shelby.
Water Nymph (Denise):::Well, hey, you guys should stick around. I’m gonna go finish cooking. 
Water Nymphs #2 and #3::: And we gotta mash more frogs.
Finn:::I can’t believe I just believe Shelby ‘cause he’s a nerd.
Jake::: I know. It's in his tone.Hey, it's the lard!
Finn::: Hey, get away from there!
Finn::: Bad lard! Lard!!
Water Nymph (Denise)::: Huh?Don’t go near there! It’s too dangerous!
Finn::: Got to save this dang lard!
Water Nymph (Denise)::: Whatever you do, don’t touch the purple stuff!
Finn::: WHOOAH!
Finn::: What did she say? Don’t touch the purple?
Finn::: What happened to the pond?
Jake:::And how ‘bout our treehouse? The house part’s a-gone! 
Finn::: What the butt?
Jake:::I guess we went through some portal to the past or some biz.
Finn::: Was stuff the wrong color in the past?
Finn::: It's weird as carbs here.
Jake::: The sea lard!There it goes!
Finn::: Lard!
Pond::: Hello, friends!

Finn:::I don’t know. It kind of makes me feel… naked.La-la-la laaaard!
Finn:::Gotcha! Finally, we can take you home!
Finn and Jake::: Huh?
Leaf Marceline:::A one-and a-two- I’d rather be anything but me, a leaf on a tree, a bug or a bee. I just want to see the sea, I want to be free from this body, this flower body.
Finn::: Please don’t change. You’re perfect just the way you are.
Leaf Marceline:::Oh, I know! I just like to write sad songs.
Finn and Jake::: Ohh! 
Finn:::Wait. Hey, Jake, what were we just doing?
Leaf Marceline::: Chasin’ the fish, Chasin’ the fish, and its getting away 
Finn::::::Get that lard!
Leaf Marceline::: Bye!You guys are writing this down, right?

Finn and Jake::: Investigate!
Finn::: Miss, your crying indicates you're in need of help.
Bush Boots:::What?Yes. I've lost my rolling pin.
Finn:::Understood. What's your name, miss?
Bush Boots:::I'm Bush Boots, the little apricot anteater 
Finn and Jake:::Hugs!
Bush Boots::: The hugs helped my crying, but it didn't help me find my rolling pin.
Finn:::Boy and dog will find your rolling pin.Where did you last see it?
Bush Boots:::It was rolling around here not too long ago.

Finn:::Dog, we have to save that rolling pin from this sweet lady.Where did it go?
Finn::: Rolling pin! We want to help!
Finn:::No more.. Slime.
Jake:::Rolling pin trail has gone cold.
Finn:::A bee. 
Jake:::I see.
Bee:::A poem by me. Listen for a sound and look around.
Finn and Jake::: Hmm?
Bee:::It's a metaphor.
Jake:::A pink pond.
Finn:::Pink pond? Pretty!
Pink pond::: Hee hee! Hello, friends!
Jake:::The pond has a face and is talking to us.

BMO:::Yay, sea lard!
Ice King::: Wow, what an adventure.

Ice King:::She sounds magnificent! How'd you say you got there?
Jake:::We didn't. Beat it, creep.
Ice King:::I'll figure it out.
Finn:::But Simon, if you go there, you'll lose you memories.
Ice King:::What memories? I'm like a goldfish over here.
Jake::: In what way, exactly?
Ice King:::Oh, hey Jake.Where am I?
Finn:::Comfy, dude? I bet you ran away 'cause we didn't appreciate you and called you gross and stuff. But you're not gross.Mwah! Goodnight, sea lard.
