Jake::: Ready?
Flame Princess::: Yes
Finn::: That was awesome! Alright, alright, my turn. 
Finn::: 
Flame Princess:::You guys are full of magic air.
Finn:::Gross!No!Princess? You, okay?
Flame Princess:::Yeah... It's just the air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad.I left all my scented candles at the castle. They'd really cut through the magic stink.
Jake::: Just go back to the Fire Kingdom and get 'em. Problem solved.
Flame Princess:::Then I'll have to see my dad. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So UNFAIR!
Finn & Jake::: 
Finn::: Uh, we can go get 'em.
Flame Princess:::Really? That would be really nice.But don't let my Pops see you. I don't want "His Majesty" thinking I need anything from him.

Jake::: 
Finn & Jake::: 
Finn::: These candles, must be "They."
Jake:::They smell like an old lady's bathroom.
Finn:::Hey! Don't disrespect my lady!

Theater troupe:::

Finn & Jake::: 
Finn::: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Jake::: 
Finn & Jake::: 
Jalapeño pepper:::Oh. Psh, actors.
Finn:::What's going with the costumes?
Theater troupe member:::This is a theater troupe. We're getting rrready to perform for the king. Everyone in the kingdom shall be in attendance.Of course, you know all this being fellow actors from the exact same troupe. 
Jake:::I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions.
Finn:::That's brilliant!
Jake::: Thanks! It's an original idea, by me.
Audience::: 
Finn:::Hey conspirator!
Jake::: Hey co-conspirator!
Finn::: Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king.
Jake::: Shhhhhh sssssomebody might here our evil plot.
Flame King:::Man, I am so lost.
Jake::: Psst, the audience.
Jake::: You think that's one of them.
Finn::: Maybe, let's keep goin'. So, what are you packin'?
Jake::: Water, man. Enough of it to put out the King's fire.
Finn::: I thinks he's starting to crack. Water? You know what is more painful, if we pour ice in his ear. That's how we'll kill the Flame King.
Flame King:::Psh, kill the Flame King? This is treason disguised as a play!Guards, seized them!
Flame Guards::: 
Finn::: What!? No!
Flame Guards::: 
Finn & Jake::: 
Finn::: Please, we were trying to warn you about the assassins!
