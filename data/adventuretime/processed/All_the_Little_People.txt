Finn::: She’s not handling the break-up very well.
Jake:::Aww.
Finn::: PB's good, though.After little Finn dumped her, she started working out. Looks like she’s really into it.
Jake::: This is messed up, dude. You’ve crossed the line from weird curiosity to some dark messed up stuff.
Finn:::I know!
Jake:::The destruction!The depravity!The wrongness of it all! I’m taking that bag back to the cliff where we found it. 
Finn::: No, man! I gotta fix this mess! Look at me, man! I’m staring into the shadow of my darkest mind hole! I gotta help him!
Jake::: You can’t! Just let them do their own biz, man!
Finn::: I junked them up too hard though! I gotta step in!
Jake::: How would ya do that?
Finn:::I’m gonna talk to him.
Jake::: But he can’t hear you.
Finn::: Yeah, why is that?
Jake::: Hmm. Maybe we’re on different dimensional planes and the border between our planes is like a two way mirror. So we can see him, but he can’t see us.
Finn:::Lemme try this. Finn! Can you hear me?We’re connected! FINN!
Jake::: Try shakin’ him.
Finn::: Why?
Jake::: Maybe we’re vibrating on different intervals. Try shakin’ him at different speeds and see if he responds.
