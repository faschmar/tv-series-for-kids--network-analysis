Gunther:::Stop, demon! Get back here, I say! Ha ha, nowhere to run. I, the great and powerful Urgence Evergreen, command you to freeze into a million pieces and leave young Gunther alone!
Gunther:::Foolish demon, you leave me no choice. Zap, zap zap zap zap! What?
Gunther::: No, Nina! You're supposed to be frozen. Nina!
Gunther:::Nina, the portals! The Elementals are gathering! C'mon, you blockhead!
Chatsberry:::I just think we should discuss this, Evergreen.
Evergreen:::"Discuss"?! Are you listening, Chatsberry? Once this comet hits, everybody dies. Not just everybody, but us, but us!
Balthus:::Now, now, hold on, Evergreen. Hath not a comet impacted our world every thousand years with no lasting grievousness?
Evergreen:::Ahh, but this, Balthus, is no ordinary comet. Behold!
Evergreen:::See how it writhes? It aches for our extinction. It—!
Chatsberry:::But Evergreen, even if the comet is as dangerous as you say, what can we possibly do?
Evergreen:::We build a crown.
Chatsberry:::"A crown"?
Evergreen:::Like none seen before, or ever after! A magical crown whose phantasmal circuitry will bond to its first bearer and grant him his one deepest wish...to destroy the hideous comet which threatens our world! The good news is I already built the crown. The bad news::: it needs a power source.The enchanted Ruby Eyes of the ancient lava dog, Magwood! And that's where you come in.
Chatsberry:::Wait, wait! Evergreen, please. Wish Magic is really the real deal! This wish may see things in you you cannot see yourself. Can you truly say you know your heart's truest desire?
Balthus:::I'm with Chatsberry. If this comet hits, we four indeed may perish. But the Elements we embody — Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime — will live on! But a misplaced wish could cause irreversible damage to the very structure of existence!
Evergreen:::Well, that's just great. What about you, Slimy D?
Slimy D::: Yo, yo. My name's Slimy D, and I'm here to—
Balthus::: Slimy D stands with us.
Chatsberry:::We reject your plan, Urgence Evergreen!
Evergreen:::Very well then. You leave me no choice.
Chatsberry:::Urgence! Stop! You'll doom us... all!
Evergreen:::Ingrate! Hmm! Doom you to no doom, maybe!Gunther!Pack my things, Gunther. We ride forth with Mount Magwood. You get to watch me save the world!Gunther!Come on, Gunther. Get your head in the game.
Gunther:::Sorry, Master Evergreen. 
Evergreen::: And he expects me to teach him the ways of magic? As if.
Gunther::: Ouch! Oof! OUCH! Uh, Master Evergreen? Can I ride on the palanquin with you? My feet are soft.No, you're right. Ooh, boy...
Gunther::: Gettin' fat.Gettin' fat, right?
Evergreen:::Hmm. 
Gunther:::However, I would suggest this is still a nice night. It's quiet.
Evergreen:::Hmm, it is quiet. Why don't you put on some music? The chimes, Gunther.
Gunther:::Okay.
Evergreen:::Gunther! I said "chimes"! Gunther, no! 
Gunther:::Sorry, Master, I'll put him back.
Ice Imp:::Heeeeey! Mmm, what?
Evergreen:::Oh, never mind.Here, take the jar and find me some water. There's not enough moisture in the air for me to make an ice camp.
Gunther:::Uh, Master? I'm sorry, I don't think I've seen any water at all today.
Evergreen:::Just do it. Don't anger Daddy.
Gunther:::Wait, are you my father?
Evergreen:::No, but I stole your egg and mutated your brain—get going! 
Gunther:::Hmm.
Gunther:::Heh, you don't know where you're going, do you, girl?Ah, you're good at this.Man, you know who I like? Master Evergreen. He can do anything; one thing he's gonna do—he said he's gonna teach me magic. I can be like him!
Gunther:::Nina, no!
Gunther:::Master Evergreen, I found the water so you could build a—oh,I guess he also found water, too.
Ice Imp::: Heeeeey?!
Evergreen:::Now, Gunther, listen to me. Don't follow me into Magwood's lair or else he'll melt your dome!
Gunther::: Yeah...
Evergreen::: Oh, Gunther! You should see this!
Gunther:::Okay!
Evergreen::: Gunther, no! You failed; he'll melt your dome.
Evergreen::: Not as grand as you once were, eh?
Gunther:::Master Evergreen, I'm sorry, but I got worried. Yeeeee!!
Gunther:::Ah! Oh, boy! Uh, maybe maybe maybe, maybe I can do magic!Like Master Evergreen. Bah! Ice! Flah, sorry... 
Gunther:::Shh!
Ice Imp:::That's what you get!Heeeey....
Evergreen::: Ice!
Evergreen:::This is why I don't teach you magic.
Gunther::: Niiina, Hiiina, Iiiina, Fiiina—
Evergreen:::Gunther! The heck are you doing?! Get in here, Gunther! Oh, there you are, you blockhead. Quickly, take your position. We have precious little time. Once I complete the bonding chant, you deactivate the force field.Bonding, bonding, three two one, you can do it, you can do it, three two one, bonding bonding. I did it! I—Come on, now, what did I ever do to you?!Watch the columns, stupid! Whoops!Easy now...Oh, wow, did you see that?!Ow, my bread balls! 
Evergreen:::Gunther?! Gunther, can you hear me?!
Gunther::: Yeah—yes, Master Evergreen!
Evergreen:::Okay, good. Now, aiming at the sound of my voice, throw the crown so it lands right on the top of my head.
Gunther:::I—wait, what?
Evergreen:::No, no, there's no time! It must be you, Gunther!
Gunther:::Me?
Evergreen:::Don't worry, it's easy. Even a mush-head like you couldn't donk it up too bad. Just focus on your deepest truest wish, the destruction of the deadly comet, and the rest will take care of itself.
Gunther::: My deepest truest wish...Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no!
Evergreen:::Gunther? Buddy? What are you wishing for down there?Gunther... no... That's the wrong wish! You've got to snap out of it! Use a concentration spell or, or a basic focusing charm—like I taught you... I mean, like I meant to teach you... I--
Gunther:::Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no!
Ice King:::Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, noooooo! . Mornin'. Man, what a dream. Do you guys ever have the dino-boy dream with the astero-- what? What... what is it?Something in my teeth? Something in my hair? Something in my nose? Something in my ear?
