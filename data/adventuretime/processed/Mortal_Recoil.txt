Nurse Pound Cake::: What's her condition, Dr. Ice Cream?
Dr. Ice Cream::: She's totally gross over 90% of her body. The other 10% is crazy nasty.
Nurse Pound Cake::: Will she make it, Doctor?
Dr. Ice Cream:::I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake.Put sugar on 'er! Two scoops!We're losing 'er!!
Ice King::: No! Not my number one! Princess, if you die on me, I will never forgive you! I'll be lost—lost in my own emotional labyri—
Finn:::YAAAAAH!!
Dr. Ice Cream::: Wait, Finn!
Finn:::What!?
Dr. Ice Cream::: Her sugar levels are stabilizing.
Princess Bubblegum:::Yes, I'm fine. I just need to rest.
Ice King:::Oh, my wife! Is there anything weird about her? I can't see through these pain tears!
Dr. Ice Cream::: She's fine. Why?
Ice King::: It's just that... after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen. Something I still don't understand.Ooh—AGH! Wait! Listen to me!!
Finn::: NO! Just shut your mouth, old man!
Ice King::: "Old man?" Heh! What? I'm not old.
Jake::: Uh, yeah, you are, dude.
Ice King::: Old? I'm... I see. It's all making sense now. Brrrrapapo!I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess.Nobody in the world.
Finn:::JUST GET OUT OF HERE!!
Ice King::: Peace.
Finn::: Sorry about that, Peebles.
Princess Bubblegum::: The ice wizard is a weak fool....
Jake::: Huh?
Raggedy Princess:::Finn! Finn! The other princesses and I made you a new backpack!

Raggedy Princess:::You're welcome, Finn!

Ice King:::Hey, Finn, are you dead or what?
Finn:::Whaaah?... Ice King? What are you doing here?
Ice King::: Hey. I had to keep an eye on the princess because she's being possessed by the Lich.
Finn:::You don't know that.
Ice King::: But I do. I saw it with my wizard eyes!In the well, I saw something come out of the Lich and go into the princess. But I wasn't sure it was real  because when you have stanky old wizard eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like crazy crazy crazy in your face all the time!All the time...Guys, let me help you. I don't want my future wife to be... physically unattractive.
Finn::: Listen, you old poot. I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice. GET STUFFED. Come on, Jake.
Finn::: We're coming, Princess!
Jake::: Dude! I think we should let the Ice King help! He can freeze her, which could buy us some t—

Finn::: I hope she's okay...
Nurse Pound Cake::: Attention, everyone...
Finn:::IS PB OKAY?!?
Nurse Pound Cake::: Yes... but there were some complications.
Finn::: NOOOOOOO!!!!
Nurse Pound Cake::: Yes... I'm afraid... there wasn't enough gum to work with, so it appears Princess Bubblegum is now...... younger.She's 13 years old now.
Ice King::: Aw, dang it! Well, I'm outta here. Goodbye, everyone. 
Finn::: 13 years old? That's how old I am.Uh...
Jake:::Whoa...
