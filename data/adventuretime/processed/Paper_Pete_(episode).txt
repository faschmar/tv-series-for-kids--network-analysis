Finn & Jake::: 
Finn::: It's slippin', dude.
Finn::: Phew.Raini-corni-copia? An Unabridged History of the Rainicorns.Whatever, man. I barely even made it through the title.
Jake::: Listen, man. One day, I'm probably gonna have half-rainbow pupsters. I gotta be able to share my babies' culture.
Jake::: 
Finn::: Huh.Oh.Hey, this table is wobbly. We gotta take it to the Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain to fix it.
Jake::: Dude, I would love to go on some crazy, made-up adventure with you, but I really gotta read this. So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you. 
Finn::: I don't make up adventures! Jake, you know that! Jake! I don't make up adventures!Hm.Books, books.Kitties, Zitties, Witties, Mitties, Knitties, Fitties, Hitties, Jitties, Pities, Cities...Oh, no! Damaged books? Who did this?!
Turtle Princess::: Shhhhhhhushh!
Finn::: Sorry.I will avenge thee, slightly-soiled books. Gotta tell Jake.
Finn::: Hello?Is someone back here? Are you stuck?
Turtle Princess::: Shhhushmm!
Finn:::Hello?Whoa! Ohhh! Hey, there's pages comin' outta these books!
People offscreen::: SHHHHHH!
Finn::: Who are you dudes?
Pagelings::: We are the Pagelings!
Paper Pete::: I am Paper Pete, the leader of the Pagelings. But you can call me P.P.
Finn::: I'll call you Pete.
Paper Pete::: Okay!
Finn::: Why are you dudes in the library?
Paper Pete::: We are the secret guardians of the books in the library. You know those blank pieces of paper in the beginning of old books?
Finn::: Yeah?
Paper Pete::: That's us! We revealed ourselves to you, noble giant, because you felt our plight when you saw the damaged books. And now is our darkest hour, for the Moldos have been growing more bold with every attack. Look at the damage done yesterdayat the Battle of Teddy Bear Joke Book.
Finn::: Wow, yeah.
Paper Pete::: They're massing for a full-scale assault on every book in the library!
Finn::: Gosh! Even the Rainicornicopia?
Paper Pete::: Yes.
Finn::: I better tell Jake. Don't you dudes go anywhere.
Pagelings::: Okay.
Finn::: Hey, bro, I've got an adventure—and it's not made up! There are these- these Pagelings they came out from- from books! And they- they folded into little animals.
Finn::: Do you hear what I'm saying?!
Jake:::Shhhh!
Finn::: You think I'm making this up?
Finn::: I'll prove it to you! 
Jake::: Finn!Finn, you butt chicken!
Finn::: Jake, wait till you see 'em.
Finn::: Ow.
Jake::: 
Finn::: They were just here! Pagelings?
Finn::: Why didn't you dudes introduce yourselves to Jake?
Paper Pete::: We don't want to reveal ourselves to anyone else. We are the secret guardians. Secret.
Finn::: Ummmm... yeah, but Jake is a powerful giant like me! He can help you battle or- or whatevs! But first, you must win his favor. Do you not want victory for your people?
Pagelings::: Yes! We do want victory!
Finn::: C'mon, follow me.Jake, look.
Finn:::He's up here reading a book.
Finn::: Do something to get his attention.
Paper Pete::: Very well. We shall dance as flowers.
Other Pagelings::: Hoo-ah!
Finn::: Okay.
Pagelings::: 
Finn::: Jake, the Pagelings are dancing for you. Just look up for a second!
Jake::: Finn, all the little voices you're doing are cute, but come on, man! Just let me read. 
Paper Pete::: By wearing the beast,we shall become like the beast. 
Finn::: You can feel them, can't you?
Jake::: I can feel you pinching me.
Finn::: Just look up for a second!Looooook.Uhhh. Pagelings, I'm sorry, but my friend is acting like a clump.
Pagelings::: Okay.
Paper Pete::: We can't wait any longer. We must go back to the bookshelf to prepare for the Moldos' attack
Jake::: Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else!
Finn::: I'm not making believe!
Paper Pete:::We were gone too long!
Paper Pete::: Wield, my brethren. Wield!
Pagelings::: 
Finn::: 
Moldo::: You win this battle, but next time, we will win.
Pagelings::: Yes, leave! Victory! Veni, vidi, vici!
Finn::: So, those little squishy guys are the Moldos?
Paper Pete::: Aye. This was but a reconnaissance squad... sent to test our mettle!
Pagelings::: Mettle!
Finn::: Uh-huh. They seem tough.
Paper Pete::: Their bites sting like the Dickens.
Finn::: Hmmm... their bites sting, eh? I've got a plan, Pete.
Paper Pete::: Tell me your plan, giant.
Finn::: Just trust me.Trust me.
Paper Pete::: You've discovered the Moldos' Secret Lair!
Finn::: Eh, it wasn't very hard.
Finn::: Wibba-wibba-wah!
Moldo::: The Pagelings have a battle beast! Attack!
Moldos::: 
Finn::: Whoa. Whoa, moldy blobs. I've come here to help the Moldos defeat the Pagelings.
Paper Pete::: Traitor!Hiyah! Yah!
Finn:::Calm down, this is part of my plan.
Paper Pete::: Ohhh, ha-ha! Then I shall play along, wise giant. 
Moldo::: How are we to trust you?
Finn::: Well... here, look.I brought you all a prisoner. It's their leader.
Paper Pete::: May you rot in {{w:::Tartarus! May your skin boil and eyes burst into flames... forever in a pit! 
Finn::: 
Paper Pete::: Traitor!
Finn::: So, do you guys have, like, a—like, a leader or somethin'?
Moldos:::Mildwin.
Paper Pete::: Mildwin.
Mildwin::: I'm Mildwin, leader of the Moldos.
Finn::: Oh, uhh... hmm.Nice to meet you, your highness.

Finn::: I bring a peace offering from the Pagelings.
Mildwin::: Hmm?
Jake::: Finn... what's happening?

Finn::: Naw, man. The war's over.Mildwin, you can keep my shirt ifyou don't attack their library books.
Mildwin::: Agreed, beast. This filthy garb will feed my people for generations.

Jake:::AAAH! What—What the hecks, man?! What'd you do to me?!
Finn:::Look, man! Moldos and Pagelings are real!
Jake::: Wha—? Who cares, man?! I'm outta here!
Finn::: Did you finish your Rainicorn book?
Jake::: Ugh... I was readin' the same paragraph over and over for, like, eleven minutes. I guess I'm gonna give up on learnin' everything about Rainicorn history. Don't tell Lady.
Finn::: Oh. What about relating to your mixed-species kids?
Jake::: Eh, I'll just fake it.
Finn::: Oh. Well... hey, man, I think I see some, um...Sun People in trouble on the sun over there.
Jake::: You makin' that up?
