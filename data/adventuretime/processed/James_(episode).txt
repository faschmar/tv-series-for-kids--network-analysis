Finn:::Jake...? Jake?Hey, man.
Jake:::Hey, dude.
Finn:::You still thinking about...
Jake:::Yeah.
Finn:::Yeah? Me, too. Princess Bubblegum's ready for us, so we should go.
Jake:::Okay. Just give me a few more months in here and I'll be ready.
Finn:::It's okay, man. Just—just play it off. Just make a—a normal face.See? Normal face.
Jake::: 
Princess Bubblegum:::Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. We may begin the ceremony!
Finn:::Thanks for bringing us along on the trip, Preebs.
Jake:::Yeah. It's unfortunate we can't enjoy some of these cool things we're passing by, but I guess we could do that the next time we're in the Desert of Wonders, whenever that is!
Princess Bubblegum:::We're on a mission to collect samples only. I want to start colonizing this area by the end of the year.
Jake:::You are killing me, PB!
Princess Bubblegum:::James, give a readout on fuel.
James:::Right away, Princess.Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop! Beet! We have a surplus of fuel, so after we collect samples, we may explore.
Finn & Jake:::Yeah!
Jake:::I'm glad James is on this trip. Hey, James, thumbs up, buddy!
Finn:::Heh. Dude, James is kind of, uh, goofy.
Jake:::I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah. Maybe when we get to know him better, it'll be charming.
Princess Bubblegum:::James, slow down. We're here.
James:::I'm registering mondo mega rads down there. I'll ready the radiation suits upon landing.
Princess Bubblegum:::Excellent. Take us down.
James:::Hold on to your sack lunch!
James::: Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!
Princess Bubblegum:::Okay. You guys collect as many surface samples as you can—rocks, plants, dirt, anything.
Jake:::Mostly looks like it's just dirt here.
James:::This'll be fun.Jake, open up the basket. I'm gonna make a shot!
Jake:::Do it!
James:::Chk-chk! Whoop! 
Jake:::Ha ha!
James:::Wah-wah!
Princess Bubblegum::: Hmm. 
Princess Bubblegum:::Aah! Ach! Brownstadt!
Princess Bubblegum:::Guys, run!
Princess Bubblegum:::James, speed up that sack lunch!
James::: Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!
Princess Bubblegum:::Ugh! 
Finn:::Ugh! Everyone okay?
Jake::: 
Finn:::Huh?Oh, my garf! What are they?!
Princess Bubblegum:::Uh, they're toxic creatures from another time.Okay, let's see—suspension's all donked, navigation's lost, and the ship's legs are kaput. We're dead in the water.
James::: Chk! Ah-oogah!
Princess Bubblegum:::Oh, yuck! Come on! Manners!Gotta brain out the situation.
Princess Bubblegum:::Those goo monsters will barf their way through the hull in mere minutes. Finn, what should we do?
Finn::: Uh... let's radio for help.
Princess Bubblegum:::Good idea, but looks like the radio's kerplowed.
James::: I can fix that radio. Mrow-row-row! Pling!With this! It's a lucky coin! Bam!When I bust out my coin, great stuff happens, like when I was chosen to go on this mission with you guys! 
Jake:::Mnh. Mnh. James, that's not helping!
Finn:::Don't panic, baby.
Princess Bubblegum:::Yes. James is very resourceful. He'll work it out.
James::: Vrrt! Veet! Vrrt! Vreet! Vrrt! Gzzzh! Jzzt! Bwr!Look, Princess! I invented a coin-operated coin screwdrive-e-er!
Princess Bubblegum:::See what I mean? Good job, James.Come on, guys. Let's take inventory of the emergency gear.
James::: Lucky coin strikes again!
Finn:::Hey, Preebos, I know things seem bad, but I'll figure out a plan.
Princess Bubblegum:::I know, Finn.
Jake:::Dude, I found us some flares! I saved us!
Princess Bubblegum:::Right on!
James:::Hey, dudes, the radio is fixed!
Jake:::Good Grod! I love you, James!
Princess Bubblegum:::I knew you could do it, James!
Jake:::You know, James, I wasn't sure about you at first, but you're okay.
James:::Thanks, Jake. I wasn't sure about you either. 
Princess Bubblegum:::James, the radio's still not working! I'm not getting any signal.
Finn::: What the skunk?!
Finn:::James, it's all sanched up!
James:::James is like, "Wha?!" It was working just a second ago, I swears! I went, like, "Choo-choo-choo!" and the radio was like, "Pch-choo-whichoo-whichoo-whichoo-whichoo," and then I was like...
Jake::: I take it back.This guy's totally cuckoo! This is my cuckoo face.
Princess Bubblegum:::He did his best, you guys.
Finn:::Right, right. Okay, time for plan B. James, pass me them flares.
James:::Chk-oo! Boop! A flare for m'liege.
Finn::: James, where are the flares?!
James:::What?! May—maybe they're, uh, invisible flares.
Jake::: Finn, PB, can I speak to you in the other room, please?!
Finn:::You want to do this trust-huddle style, buddy?
Jake::: Hm.
Princess Bubblegum:::So what's all the hubbub?
Jake:::What's up with that James dude?
Finn:::Yeah. Do you think James could be breaking things on purpose?
Princess Bubblegum:::No. James wouldn't do that.
Jake:::Wake up. Dude's a saboteur.
Princess Bubblegum:::It's not James.
James:::What's not James?I got lonely up front. I wanted to see what y'all are up to.
Finn:::Hey, that gives me an idea.
James:::Me, too! Vrrt!Just kidding! I don't have any ideas.
James:::Diversion.D-d-d-d-d-d-diversion! Time to set up a diversion.
Jake:::You see anything, brudda?
Finn::: Ah, I got bunkus. Wait. If we jam up to that cliff face, I think we can climb—whoop.More goo bros.
Finn:::What the—?!
Princess Bubblegum:::That won't hold them for long.
Jake:::It can't end like this. I got a lady and five kids! I thought I'd outlive at least one of them!
James:::Here, man. Take this. 
Jake:::Your lucky coin?
James:::Yeah, man. It always keeps me calm.
Finn::: Who shot that flare, James?
Princess Bubblegum:::We don't have time to point fingers.
Finn::: You're right. There's only one way out of this jam. One of us has to eat the big one so the others can survive.
Finn:::And I'm gonna be that one. I'll run up there and get the creatures to chase me, and while they're busy noshing on my teen-boy body, you three can climb to safety. Don't try to talk me out of it. I got crystal certainty. This is what it means to be a he—
Jake:::Wha—?
Princess Bubblegum::: James. We need to talk.
Princess Bubblegum:::So, what do you say?
James:::Sure thing, Princess!Byong!
Finn:::Ugh! Huh? Why did—Jake?
Finn:::Wh—where's James? 
Finn:::James! 
Finn::: Aah! James, look out! Ohh. PB! What's going on?
Princess Bubblegum:::Finn, I need to explain something really heavy. I was the one who sabotaged all your escape plans. I calculated the chance of success for every possible escape plan, and none of them were going to work. You said it yourself::: there was only one way out. Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others. James did something really noble to save us.
Finn:::But I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?
Princess Bubblegum:::There's a reason. With this sample of James, I can clone a new one. He's candy, but you're not. I can't clone another you.
Finn:::Whoa.
Princess Bubblegum:::I made the best choice available.
Princess Bubblegum:::James served the Candy Kingdom on a dangerous mission, and even though he is gone and it's super sad, I would like to honor James... with this new James I whipped up in the lab!
James' Clone:::Jeet!
Princess Bubblegum:::Here you go, James— an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James! 
Finn:::Is this right or wrong? I can't tell.
James' Clone:::Hey, cool. Did I do something cool? Do I do something cool?
Jake:::I don't know, man.Here's your coin, James.
James' Clone:::Wow! This day keeps getting better and better!
Jake:::Ehh.
