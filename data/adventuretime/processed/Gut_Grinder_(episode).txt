Finn::: Jake! Jake!Jake?Hmmm... 
Jake::: Aaaah!Aaaaah!Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl!Uh! That sounded horrible, man! 
Finn:::I don't know how to play.
Jake:::Exactly! 
Finn:::Huh? Let's go! 
Jake:::Oh, wait up. I gotta finish tuning my viola.
Finn:::Soft People! Why are you all in a tizzy?
Soft Person #1:::The Gut Grinder! He's back!
Finn:::The "Gut Grinder?"
Old Soft Person:::Yes, the Gut Grinder is a gold-eating monster. In the past, the Soft People of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it. It was awesome ! But then, the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold. So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup. And it worked! The Gut Grinder didn't come back! But recently, and admittedly it was probably a bad idea, we took our gold out from under the cup and we put it in the center of town. Haha, 'cause--'cause we really like dancing around it! But, boy oh boy, was that a mistake. You know what happened?
Finn:::Uhhh... it came back and ate all your gold?
Old Soft Person::: Yes, oh, yes!
Finn:::Aw, don't cry, Soft Old Man. I'll find this monster and bring peace to this village. I swear!
Soft Person #1:::Swear to what?
Finn:::I swear to justice!
Soft People:::Whoa! He swears to justice!
Finn:::Okay, so, what does he look like?
Old Soft Person:::Ohh, it's so scary we usually close our eyes and go wee-wee when he attacks. But...he left this footprint...Wha--?
Jake::: Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Soft Person #1:::Look! His paw matches the footprint!
Soft Person #1:::I'm so scared, I'm gonna go wee-wee!
Finn:::Whoa, no, no-no-no-no! Calm down, everybody. This is my friend, Jake the Dog.
Soft Person #2::: Thank goodness.
Soft Person #1:::Yeah--I almost wee-wee'd!
Jake:::Wait, you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder?
Soft Person #1:::Oh, yeah! We're terrified of him.
Jake::: Then I am the Gut Grinder!
Soft Person #1:::I'm gonna wee-wee! 
Finn::: That guy wee-wees weird.
Jake:::I'm just kiddin', everybody. I'm not the Gut Grinder. I'm...Jake the Dog! Woohoo!
Soft Person #3:::Aw, he's just a cute little dog!
Jake:::Hey, I'm not cute!
Soft Child::: Doggy!Pet, pet, pet! 
Jake:::Huh? Oh, heheh. 
Finn:::Pfft.
Jake:::What?!
Finn:::I didn't say anything.People of the village of Soft People, I, Finn, and my buddy Jake, will find this monstrous monster and slay it!
Finn:::Come on, let's go, Jake.
Jake::: Oh... heheh. What? No!Noooo...
Soft Child:::Bye-bye, doggy!
Jake::: Bye, Soft Village.
Jake:::Hey Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well. Hm, what if I really am the Gut Grinder? 
Finn:::Dude, your paws'll fit anything.
Jake::: That is true. Check this out.I'm Finn the Human and I stink at viola!
Finn::: I'm Jake the Dog and I put my nose in poop.
Jake:::There's a lot of interesting smells in poop.
Finn:::Huh? 
Finn:::Hey Cube People, what's going on here?
Cube Person #1:::The Gut Grinder stormed into our village and ate all of our gold!
Jake::: Wait, what happened?
Cube People:::Aaah! The Gut Grinder!
Finn:::Whoa, no, no, no! He's not the Gut Grinder! He's my friend!
Cube Person #2:::We saw the Gut Grinder and he looks exactly like him!
Jake::: Th-that's ridiculous.
Finn:::Jake, back to your normal size.
Jake:::Oh yeah.Ooh ooh ooh.I am not... the Gut Grinder. Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh.
Cube Person #1:::Aw, he's just a cute little dog.
Jake:::Hey! Y'all are the ones who are cute. I'm hot.
Cube Person #1:::Aw, look--he's all mad!
Cube Person #2:::Even cuter.

Jake::: Ruff, ruff, grrrr... 
Finn:::Huh... Which way did he go?
Finn:::Jake! Hey, come on!
Jake:::Wha--?Where am I?
Finn::: Thanks, guys!
Jake::: I'm not cute. I'll mess you up.
Jake:::Finn...? What if I am the Gut Grinder?
Finn:::What?!
Jake:::What if I'm, like, stealing gold in my sleep?
Finn:::You can't be stealing gold in your sleep--I watch you while you sleep.
Jake:::Wha--? Yo, Finn, that is creepy, man.
Finn:::I can't help it. I take pictures.
Jake:::Well, when do you sleep?
Finn:::Justice never sleeps.
Jake:::Well, there's gotta be a time when you're not watchin' me... that--that I--that I might be stealin' gold unconsciously!
Finn::: You... are... not... the... Gut... Grinder!
Alarm:::City in danger! City in danger!
Finn:::Let's go! Oh, wait--what if these guys think you're the Gut Grinder? Hmm...Ah-ha!Got the perfect thing for ya:::Groucho glasses! 
Jake:::I love it!Launch in 3, 2, 1! 
Finn:::Woohoo! Yeah!
Finn:::Oh, man! These people are a mess!
Spiky Guard:::Halt! Identify yourselves immediately!
Finn:::I am Finn the hero!
Jake::: I'm Groucho!
Finn:::We're on a mission to catch the Gut Grinder.
Spiky Mayor:::I am the mayor of this village. Our gold has just been stolen by the very monster you speak of.
Finn:::I hereby vow to catch that thief and bring your gold back!
Spiky Mayor:::Our people thank you. I present to you this photoof the Gut Grinder to help in your mission.
Finn::: Oh, thanks.
Jake::: Wha--?Finn, it's me!
Finn::: Well, duh, it looks like you.We already knew that. It's just one of those weird coincidences--like how my belly button looks like your face.
Jake:::Yeah, I-I know you think it does, Finn--but this is different. I'm scared, Finn. 
Finn:::Jake, stop it!
Spiky Mayor:::Wha--? Oh, it's the Gut Grinder!
Finn:::No, no-no-no-no! He's not the Gut Grinder! I swear on my good name... and justice... and Jake's cute face!
Spiky Mayor:::His face is weird. The truth is obvious::: your friend is the Gut Grinder!
Finn:::NOOOOOO!
Spiky Mayor::: You are under arrest for stealing our gold.
Finn::: I'll get you out of here... somehow.
Jake:::No, Finn... I belong behind bars. Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder.
Finn:::Buddy, listen to me. You've been my best friend for as long as I can remember! That's enough evidence to prove to me that you're not a monster!
Jake:::Then... why am I in jail? Only Gut Grinders go to jail.
Old Man Prisoner:::I'm in jail and I'm not the Gut Grinder.I'm here for the free grub.Hehehehehe! 
Finn:::Huh? Wait, I got an idea!
Finn:::Hey, Gut Grinder! I got some gold here that you missed. Come and get it!
Finn:::Huh. Whoa, you're the Gut Grinder?
Old Man Prisoner::: Oh, Gut Grinder. Oh, Gut Grinder... you're a little cutesy. You're a little cutesy-wootsy.
Jake:::Huh? Grrrr... not cute.Am I the Gut Grinder?All the clues fit!I must be the Gut Grinder!And I want GOLD!

Jake::: Grrrr! I'm not Jake--I'm the Gut Grinder! Now give me that gold tooth!
Finn:::What? Jake?Whoa!
Finn::: Whoa!
Jake::: Rawr! Now give me that tooth!
Finn:::If I give you this stupid tooth, will you stop being a crazy jerk?!
Finn:::What the--? Jake! You never turn into a monster when I want you to. It's always, "Not now, Finn. I have a headache." Oh, Jake,your viola is all I have now. 
Jake::: Huh?Ah, stay away from my viola!
Finn:::Jake, you remember your viola!
Jake::: I also remember that you stink hard at playing it. And dookie is radical, man! I don't care what anyone says.Wha--huh? What? Where am I? Finn, is that you?
Finn:::Who else would it be, baby?
Jake:::Whoo!I guess I went nuts.
Finn:::You were so crazy, man! Like--like, actually crazy.
Finn::: It's good to have you back.
Jake:::It's good to have you pat my back.
Finn::: Man, if I had known you were so easily manipulated, I would have eaten more of your ice cream.
Jake::: Cut it out!
Spiky Person:::Cut open the Gut Grinder's belly!
Spiky Mayor:::What the--?What the--? Sharon, what are you doing in the Gut Grinder?
Spiky People::: That's the mayor's wife!
Spiky Mayor::: And the Gut Grinder's skin is not skin at all--it's cloth! Sharon! Have you been sewing?!
Sharon::: Yes, Cameron. I've been stealing gold.
Spiky Mayor:::WHY, SHARON?!
Sharon:::Because I like to buy things, Cameron! I like to shop! And I dressed up like Jake because I think he's hot.
Spiky Mayor:::You have been a naughty girl, Sharon.Guards! Throw my wife in jail.Finn and Jake, thank you for saving my Spiky Village.
Finn::: No problem, mayor.
Spiky Mayor:::Now give us a hug.
Finn:::No, don't do that! Don't hug us!Don't touch me! AAAAAAAAAH!
