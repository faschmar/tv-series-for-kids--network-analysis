Peppermint Butler:::Swordsmith Deity, from your unseen throne, bless this sword with your mighty hone! This new sword is guaranteed to defend you against Princess Bubblegum's heinous family. Uncle Gumbald!
Peppermint Butler:::Aunt Lolly! 
Peppermint Butler:::Cousin Chicle! 
Jake:::I like your swordsmith hat.
Jake:::Am I your special guest? 
Peppermint Butler:::No.
Jake:::Dang.
Peppermint Butler:::This sword will serve you much better than your old, cursed Grass Sword. This sword is also cursed, but it has a compass in the hilt! 
Finn:::Neat! 
Peppermint Butler:::Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum! 
Finn:::Hunson Abadeer!
Hunson:::Finn the Human! And Jake the Dog! Hey, did Marceline call me-?
Peppermint Butler:::It is I who summoned you. I humbly ask you for an infusion of Nightosphere magic upon this sword. 
Hunson:::Okay.
Peppermint Butler:::I proclaim this blade"The Night Sword"! Now to send you back.
Hunson:::Not so fast. It's like I got a free flight here. I'm gonna go see my little girl.
Finn:::Back in the hole, Marceline's dad.
Hunson:::I'll behave myself. No soul sucking, no evil stuff. I'm trying to be a better person. Maybe it's too late for me, but I'm trying. Oh, I'm so ashamed of the things I've done! 
Peppermint Butler:::Have some dignity, man! All right. You may leave the circle for one day.
Hunson:::Wheeeeee! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Time to suck some souls! 
Hunson:::Hey, what gives?
Peppermint Butler:::Phantom manacles your wrists shall constrain until you're back in your hole again! Finn.
Finn:::Let's go see Marcy.
Jake:::Great sword making, Pep But.
Peppermint Butler:::Yo, see you guys at the concert! 
Hunson:::Walkin' in ooo, not suckin' out souls Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck.
Finn:::Hey, could you stop saying that, please? 
Hunson:::So what's my little monster up to these days? Is she still all goody-goody? Still half-vampire? Started dating anyone? 
Finn:::Yes, yes, but no, then yes again, and maybe? Look, maybe cool it with the prying around Marceline.
Hunson:::Nah, she loves it when I pry.
Chicle::: Oh, Chicle, have you finally discovered the vampire girl's weakness? I think sooo. Chuckling mode off.
Hunson::: You know, now that we're here, I'm having second thoughts. It just seems like no matter what I do, I always tick that girl off.
Hunson::: Marceline! Long time no see. Some googoo with glasses summoned me. What's that thing? Just gonna put this here, okay? Now let's go suck some souls! 
Hunson::: I don't know what it is.
Jake::: Uhh, heh.
Finn::: Psst-psst .
Marceline:::Dad, what are you doing here? 
Hunson:::I'm in town for the week, and I don't really have a place to stay, dot, dot, dot.
Marceline:::Mnh. How many souls did he suck on his way here? 
Finn:::Oh, I guess like zero. But- 
Hunson:::See! I made Finn a cool, new sword and everything! 
Marceline:::I guess you can crash here.
Marceline:::That is not what's happening.
Finn:::We're gonna jet, Marcy.
Hunson:::What?! You just got here. Invite them in, Marceline.
Hunson:::Do you have a bathroom? 
Marceline:::Yeah, there's one upstairs.
Hunson:::I just have to freshen up.
Marceline:::Is my dad really behaving himself this time? 
Finn:::He's just been singing songs and stuff.
Jake:::Yeah, he seems pretty fun for an old guy. Hey, wait a minute... I'm an old guy! 
Hunson:::Hey, excuse my unsociableness. There's just one thing; The Venetian blinds in your bathroom kind of jumped out at me and got broken.
Marceline:::How could you wreck the blinds just by going to the bathroom? 
Hunson:::Let me make it up to you. I've got some soy sauce and some ketchup.
Marceline:::I'm good.
Hunson:::Here's an SD card, some twist ties.
Marceline:::I don't want any of this junk! 
Hunson:::Hey! I'm gonna need a place to sleep tonight. Do you have an air mattress? 
Marceline:::Yeah.
Hunson:::Great! You can sleep on the air mattress, and I'll sleep on your bed.
Marceline:::It's in the closet.
Hunson:::Finn, are you gonna let my little girl blow up that air mattress? 
Finn:::Not on my watch! 
Marceline:::Hey, Dad, I think I'm gonna go out for a walk before bedtime.
Finn:::But, Marcy don't you have a solo gig tonight? 
Marceline:::Ss-ss-ss-ss! 
Jake:::I get it. It's air mattress talk. Ss-ss-ss-ss. Aren't you giving a concert tonight? Ss-ss-ss. At the Ghost Amphitheater? Ss-ss-ss.
Hunson:::Concert? It's a good thing your friends remembered that.
Hunson:::Let's go! 
Marceline::: 
Chicle::: 
Finn:::Do you hear, like, a really stupid-sounding laugh?
Jake:::Yes.
Chicle:::I have a nice laugh.
Chicle:::Time to blend in completely unnoticed. 
Unnamed Ghost::: 
Chicle:::Hey, what you got there? Peanuts?
Marceline:::Hello, Hamburger Hills Cemetery!
Hunson:::Marceline! You're doing great, baby! 
Marceline:::I haven't started yet. 
Hunson:::Hey, Pennebaker! No illegal recording unless you're family. Yoink.Just ignore me.
Marceline:::Dad! You're wrecking the show! 
Hunson:::This is my daughter! I am proud of my punk daughter! I made that! 
Jake:::Sit down, man! 
Peppermint Butler:::Yeah, you're killing the vibe.
Hunson:::I'm just explaining my part in all this.
Chicle:::Ugh. This is terrible. Boo, I say.
Ghost:::Yeah! Boooo! 
Hunson:::Don't worry, honey. I'll work the crowd. Hey, it's me Hunson! I'm happy to field any questions from you dummies.
Chicle:::Can you believe Marceline has a bougie trash daddy? I heard this guy even eats ghosts, you know, like us.
Ghost:::What? Really?! 
Hunson:::Sure, sometimes.
Ghost:::Off the stage, skin sack! 
Hunson:::Okay, okay, settle down, pal. Don't make me come out there.
Ghost:::What you gonna do "eat my fries?"
Marceline::: My bass! 
Hunson:::Come on, ectoplasm comes right off. 
Marceline:::Don't! You wreck everything.
Ghost:::Mad daddy! 
Hunson:::Hammer fist strike! 
Chicle:::Let's get him, fellas.
Hunson:::Ha-ha!
Marceline:::Dad, quit clowning.
Hunson:::Uh, just havin' a little fun.
Marceline:::Come on, Dad, fight back! 
Finn:::He can't. Pep Buts bound his powers.
Marcline:::What?! 
Hunson:::They sassed you.
Finn:::Better pop that cork, Peps.
Peppermint Butler:::All right. All right.
Finn:::Chicle! 
Chicle:::Oh, whoops, was that bad? 
Ghost:::Vampires can't hurt ghosts, stupid.
Marceline::: Shoot.
Finn:::Finn's turn! 
Ghost:::Wha?! 
Marceline::: Good night, Hamburger Hills! There will be no encore.
Princess Bubblegum:::My gracious. I'm so sorry you had to deal with Cousin Chicle's schemes. My family's out of control.
Hunson:::It's fine. My cool daughter took care of it. And guess what I got from a vendor.It looks too big to me. But they said that's the style now with punk rockers.
Marceline:::Thanks for standing up for me tonight.
Hunson:::I'm bad, but I'm no so bad, right? So when are you gonna have some kids? 
Marceline:::Dad!Â
