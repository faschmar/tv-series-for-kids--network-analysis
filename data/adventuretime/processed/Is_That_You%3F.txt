Finn & Jake::: Fallen ally, fallen ally, home now in the sky. Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry.
Finn:::A truer friend, there was none.
Finn & Jake::: And Prismo was his name.
Jake:::An artisan of pickling, and now just one remains.
Jake:::And now just one—I can't do this, man! I-it just can't be over!
Finn:::Hey... We can put it back in the fridge, if you want.
Jake:::No, these picks were made by our friend to be mouth-loved!
Jake:::We have to honor his memory with a final taste of his genius.Get ready for the dream ritual.
Finn & Jake::: Prismo we love you forever in our dreams!
Finn & Jake::: Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA!
Jake:::Finale!
Finn:::Whoof! What was that?
Jake:::Quick, to bed! This has to be the last thing we think about!
Finn:::Hyup! 
Jake:::Okay... dream! 
Finn::: Aughhh!Whoo! Crazy dream, man. Prismo was definitely in it, but—Jake?
Finn:::You up already?
Finn:::What the...
Jake::: Whup! Oof.I love you, Everything Burrito.
Finn:::Jake, why are you pretending to dig up Everything Burrito?
Jake:::Huh, what?
Finn:::Hold on, I'm coming down.
Finn:::Jake, you gotta hear my dream, I—Jake?
Jake::: Hey, man, you're shaking it all wrong!
Finn:::What the jump?
Jake::: Shh. Let me show you how.. it's... done!
Finn:::Jake, are you sleepwalking?
Jake:::No, I'm showing this— Whoaaaa! 
Finn:::Wake!Up!Tunk... I'm not dreaming!
Jake::: You made an oath. Okay.
Jake:::Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.
Finn::: Jake! I saw you explode. Something messed up is haps, bruh.
Jake:::Pshhh. Please, not even. 
Finn:::No, man, you blew into chunks over there! 
Jake:::Uh, because Kee-Oth was right there! A-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. Uuuuuhhh... 
Finn:::Jake, this already happened. C'mon, man, stop freakin' me out 
Finn::: Ugh, Jake dust!
Jake:::Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes 
Jake:::Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes 
Jake::: Take some bacon and I'll put it in a pancake 
Jake::: Bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make 
Jake::: Bacon pancaaake! 
Finn:::Dude, what is the deal?
Jake::: Dude, what is the deal?
Prismo::: Huh hmm huh hmm huh hmm. I can't wait to get this batch of pickles to Jake. He's totes gonna bust a pipe when he gets hit with the cumin and the undertones of sage that come in later. 
Jake::: Prismo, I'm right here! Where you going, bro!? 
Jake::: Wait up, man, how're you alive!?Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the— 
Jake::: The Lich?!
The Lich:::Wake up.
Prismo:::Wa—Wait, I've changed my mind—
Jake::: Wait, why is this happening? It's like a rerun of the worst junk.
Jake::: Lich life-sucks Prismo's dream host, eliminates Prismo forever. Ugh, it's mad gris bro. And then the Space Police, or whatever they're called, show up because boppin' Prismo is a cosmic crime. I remember feelin' like someone had peeled a layer away from my brain, and my reality was no longer anchored to any point of reference, and I had to fight to keep from being crushed under the weight of an unforgiving new paradigm of ultimate reality. So cool, man. So why am I seeing this again?
Jake:::Uhhh, that's cool...
Jake:::Uhh, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough guy contest!Whoo-hoo!Tough boys!
Jake:::Come on, man! Tough Guy contest me!
Finn::: Okay, seems like all of Jake's remanifesting themselves,but as soon as I break their history it creates a paradox and Jake explodes.
Jake::: Whoa, Finn, how'd you get over there? 
Jake:::Finn, when I die my individual Earth consciousness is going to go all over everywhere while Glob tallies my deeds.
Finn::: What?
Jake:::I'm going to all around you , in your nose, in your dreams and your socks...
Finn:::"in your dreams?"
Jake:::Yeah, that's what I said, in your dre— 
Finn:::All this striz happened when Jake and I tried to preserve Prismo's pickles in our dreams, something must have changed when we went to sleep!
Finn::: So, ugh, I just got to hope that Jake tries to do the pickle ritual again. So I can re-enact it with him. Exactly the way it happened, maybe?! Geez!
Jake::: Fallen ally, fallen ally, you're home now in the sky.
Finn & Jake::: Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry.
Jake:::I guess I'm headed towards that door..
Prismo:::Dude, I get out of relationships because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna to have for dinner every night!'Cause when I'm alone...
Jake:::Hehe, all these dudes and their lady problems...
Prismo:::That's right, Prismo is nothing but the dream of a wrinkly old man.
Jake:::What if the whole world was just some goof's dream? Man, that would be stupid. Whoa!
Jake:::<nowiki>Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!? This couldn't be a...oh Grod!Permanent, opposing, industrial-strength, magnetic bed!Hand-hewed from a single treeOh, man! Look at this mattress!What is it?Smells like a blend of cashmere...Mohair, silk and wool maybe...The thread count on this is in the thousands! And it's filled with...Down feathers of a baby griffin! That's illegal!Glass of milk... This feels like a trap designed by some kind of sick genius!</nowiki>
Jake:::Well...hats off to you sir or madam, your trap was a success!
Jake:::Oh my blahs!It's like I'm getting Eskimo kisses from an army of angels! 
Prismo::: Oh, dang, I'm back!
Finn & Jake::: Prismo we love you forever in our dreams!
Finn & Jake::: Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA!
Jake:::Finale!
Finn:::Whoof! What was that?
Jake:::Quick, to bed! This has to be the last thing we think about!
Finn:::Hyup! 
Jake:::Okay... dream! 
Finn::: Whoa! The pickle jar! I'm coming Jake! 
Finn:::Whoa...Where the heck am I?
Jake::: Wait up, man, how're you alive!?
Finn:::Jake!? I'm coming man!
Jake:::Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the—
Finn:::Jake! Don't explode!
Prismo:::Finn, hold up.
Finn:::Prismo! I saw you die, dude!
Prismo:::Yep, I'm still dead. I'm actually talking to you from the past, I set up this plan B scenario in case I ever got croaked for reals. So if this is happening then I guess I got croaked and my pickles ran out. But Jake and I established a bro-bond that could bring me back through his dreams.
Finn:::So, are you actually talking to me right now or are you pretending to in an empty room?
Prismo:::I was pretending, but now I can see you.
Finn:::What does 'now' meant to you?
Prismo:::Uhhh...hurry up I need your help 
Jake::: Where you going bro? Wait up man, how're you alive?
Finn:::So where're we going?
Prismo:::You've gotta wake up Jake and then...umm, you'll see.
Finn:::I'll see what, Prismo?
Prismo:::Shoot, I don't know if I thought this thing all the way through..
Finn::: Whaaaat?
Prismo:::Aw, it'll be cool.It'll be cool.
Revived Prismo:::Dude, I can't believe I died. Jake I'm sorry man. This doesn't feel right.
Past Prismo::: Ok, go wake Jake up and bring him back here 
Revived Prismo:::Whoa, Finn, hey, are you gonna wake up Jake?
Finn:::Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though?
Revived Prismo:::My past self is doing plan B right?
Finn:::Uh, yes. Although I gotta say that this is as rickety as yoga balls.
Revived Prismo:::Yeah, tell me about it.
Finn:::You tell you about it!
Revived Prismo:::I think you would blow up if I did that.
Finn:::Well, anyway, here I go.Hey, Jake, wake up.
Revived Prismo:::I'm out. 
Jake::: Hey, Finn, what's going on?
Finn:::We gotta bounce.
Jake::: No, bro, don't tear me away from nirvana. Wait, nooo!Oof!I'm okay now.
Finn:::Coolthis way!
Past Jake:::Whoa! Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!?
Jake:::Prismo?! You're alive! 
Prismo:::Well, not yet. Finn, in a second you've gotta stop yourself from waking up Jake.
Finn::: Stop my who?
Prismo::: Shoot! Hide!
Past Finn:::Think we should turn around somewhere, I feel like we're lost.
Past Prismo:::No I was just stalling, don't think about it, c'mon, this way.
Prismo:::THAT who.
Prismo:::But wait, Jake, that means one of your alternate reality incarnations will sleep for eternity to keep me alive.
Jake:::Cool, dude!
Prismo:::OK, Finn, I'm not sure what'll happen if you confront yourself. He might explode.
Finn:::'He', me or other me?
Prismo:::You know what? Forget it.
Finn:::Shut it Prismo, heroes risk everything for their friends. Although I admit you're more Jake's friend than mine. Sometimes you can think someone is totally cool, but you never become besties. Now I don't know why that happens, but regardless let's do this. 
Prismo:::Good luck!
Revived Prismo:::Whoa, Finn, hey! Are you gonna wake up Jake?
Past Finn::: Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though?
Prismo:::My past self is doing plan B, right?
Finn::: PLAN B!
Past Finn::: What the—!? 
Finn:::This is me? This sword is me?
Prismo:::Finn sword, dude.
Finn:::Welcome back, Prismo.
Prismo:::Thank you, Finn.
Jake::: Welcome back, Prismo.
Prismo:::Thank you, Jake.
