Princess Bubblegum:::Ah fudge! What time is it? I gotta go to Veggie Village for the Annual Technology Fair. Will y’all watch my Princess Plant for me?I usually hire a sitter but- Ehn!
Finn::: Of course, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum::: Awesome! Thank you, Finn. I will be back on the Morrow. SCREEEEEEEE!
Finn::: You’re in good hands, Princess Plant.
Finn::: And then the monster got punched in the head and the princess was safe. And everyone was happy!
Finn::: 
Finn::: Time to lay down beautiful buddy.
Jake::: Yeah. Time to make sleepies!
Finn::: Ahhh. We killed it, man!
Jake::: I know!
Finn::: Okay.All we gotta do, is go to the Land of the Dead and reclaim the flower’s soul from death before Bubblegum returns.
Jake::: Okay!
Peppermint Butler::: Excuse me, but did you all say Land of the Dead?
Finn::: Oh, what?! Oh, uh… yeah.
Peppermint Butler::: I can take you.
Finn::: Really?
Peppermint Butler::: Certainly, Finn.For a small price. Which we can discuss later! Take my hands, gentlemen! 
Peppermint Butler::: Stare into where the two walls meet. Now slowly, cross your eyes.Do it, fools!
Peppermint Butler::: The portal opens!
Peppermint Butler::: Say ‘hi’ to Death for me if you see him! He lives in a castle made of light!
Jake::: Uh… okay.
Finn::: Thanks Peppermint Butler. 
Peppermint Butler::: And don’t drink the-water.
Jake::: Whoa man, who knew Peppermint Butler was so-
