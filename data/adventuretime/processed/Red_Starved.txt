Finn:::What's wrong with you, man?
Jake:::I ate all the candy in your backpack, and now I'm sick.
Finn:::I didn't bring any candy.
Jake:::Oh, no. That explains why it didn't taste right.
Finn:::Nothing tastes right today. Like, I thought we were going to get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish.
Jake:::That's how I feel—like a dying parsley. So what's goin' on with the spoon? Marceline and the spoon.
Finn:::Um...nothing.Wait, there she goes!
Marceline::: Yo, wake up, sand dude.I think they're dead.A spoon.
Finn::: Yea-uh. The Spoon of Prosperity!
Jake:::It doesn't look like mu—
Jake:::Oh, my gosh, I feel so much better! Hungry, even. Guys, let's go home!
Finn:::We've gotta get this spoon to Princess Bubblegum first.
Jake::: Let's rock!
Marceline:::What's PB want with that spoon, anyway?
Finn:::Beats me.
Jake:::Sometimes it's better not to know.
Marceline:::Yeah, I guess that's true with Bonnibel.
Jake:::Hey, guys, look what I found! 
Marceline:::Is that quicksand?
Jake:::Yeah!Heh. Quicksand is pretty fun. Heh.
Finn:::Quit messing around, Jake.
Jake:::Okie-doke.
Finn:::Whoa!
Jake:::Hmm. Hey, is this whole place made out of sand?
Marceline:::Sure looks that way.
Jake:::Uh, give me a pull, please.Stop, you guys are tickling me! Let me try this other thing.Flesh drill!
Finn:::I'm not sure that's a good idea—
Jake::: Yaah! Rug burn! Ow! Ow!
Jake:::Aah!Whoo! It worked! Jake drill worked, you guys.
Finn:::Whoa!
Jake:::Check it out! My piggies are free. 
Marceline:::You just demolished half the underground city!
Jake:::Yeah, only half.
Finn:::You also sealed our exit.
Jake:::Our only exit.
Marceline::: 
Jake:::No regre-e-e-ets!I'm sorry.This little piggie stayed home, and so should have I. I know! I'll dig us out of here.
Finn & Marceline:::No!
Finn:::You'll bury us alive!
Marceline:::Undead!
Finn::: Finn to PB. Come in, PB.
Princess Bubblegum:::Oh, hi, Finn.
Finn:::Princess, we're trapped in the underground city.
Princess Bubblegum:::Yeah-yeah. That sounds great.
Finn:::Huh? No, we need help!
Princess Bubblegum:::That's great!Gre-gre-great! Great, great!
Finn::: Guess we lost the signal. 
Marceline:::Any more bright ideas?
Jake:::Snacks!
Marceline:::How are snacks gonna get us out of here?
Jake:::I wanna eat snacks... because I am hungry.
Marceline:::I'm hungry, too. Bust the snacks, Finn.
Jake:::Bust, bust, bust!
Marceline:::Hey, where are my red erasers? They were in here.
Jake:::Uh-oh. I thought they were candy.
Marceline:::You... ate all... MY RED?!?!
Jake:::Oooh. I'm sorry!
Finn:::Calm down, Marceline. There's gotta be some red stuff in these ruins. I'll go explore. You guys hang out here and save your energy.
Marceline:::Thanks, Finn.
Finn::: Be cool.
Jake::: So how hungry are you?
Jake:::Aah!I'm sorry. Please don't eat my blood!
Marceline::: Jake, I don't want to hurt you, but you should know things get crazy when I'm hungry.
Jake:::Like... how crazy?
Marceline:::I'm gonna go into feral mode.It's not gonna be pretty.
Jake::: 
Marceline:::I know. Let's tie me up. That way, you won't be scared.
Jake:::And that will keep you from draining my bloods?
Marceline:::Not physically, no, but as a prop, I think it'll be good for both of us. You know, psychologically.
Jake:::Hurry, Finn.
Finn:::Red, red, red. I guess even a vampire queen's face would melt off if she tried to eat lava.
Marceline:::Get me a bucket of lava, Jake.
Jake::: Yo, you know better than that.
Marceline:::Do iiiit...
Jake:::Don't go crazy, okay?
Marceline:::I'm frickin' hungry.
Jake::: Why did you leave me here, dude? 
Finn:::Okay, here we go. Yeah, look at that!Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm.Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wisemen-zerts <!--?-->. Oh, well. Gotta feed the Marcy monster.'Scuse me. Up, sorry. Okay. Uhh... hi-yah!Oh, dag.
Finn:::Cool... What the heck happened here?Whoop!Ew. Whoops. Y'alls got turned into sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this.Around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm...Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right?
Finn:::Okay. I was just making sure.Bet that guy was a creep.This hole is deep.
Jake:::Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob, where are you, man? Marcy's wiggin' out!
Marceline:::Jaaaake...
Jake:::What?
Marceline:::I can smell your insides, Jake.They smell...red!
Marceline:::Yeah, lemme see in there.
Marceline:::Oh, yeah.
Finn:::Maybe I should go back. Well, I've already gone this far.Shebang! That oughtta be enough red to un...Oops.
Crab Demon:::Paris? Is that you?
Finn:::You mean the guy with the big thing on his head?
Crab Demon:::Yes. Have you returned to complete the plan?
Finn:::Naw. Paris is, like, super dead.
Crab Demon:::What?! No! How long?
Finn:::Dude, like, a really long time. Like five hundred years.
Crab Demon::: Five hundred— Chum! I must've zoned out!
Finn:::What the heck were you two doing?
Crab Demon:::Once we turned the city to sand, we were gonna reanimate their bodies and conquer my homeland at the center of the planet.
Finn:::Hm, that's dumb.
Crab Demon:::Time to go back home a true loser.
Finn:::Can I have this big ol' ruby, then?
Crab Demon:::That's an emerald.
Finn:::Clearly it's a big ol' ruby.
Crab Demon:::I don't know what to tell you, man.
Finn:::I would like the ruby.
Crab Demon:::It's yours, buddy.I'm outties. ]
Finn:::Peace. Hyup! Whoops.
Jake:::Okay,all done now. Nice and snug, right?
Marceline:::Jake...
Jake::: What?
Marceline:::I won't be able to... to control myself much longer. I can feel the feeding frenzy coming on.I just wanna let you know I'm sorry. 
Jake:::You're sick!
Marceline:::Yeah... 
Jake:::C'mon, Jake, think...It's no good! I need brain food.Oh, dang, I ate everything!I'm so hungry! Baby's gonna starve to death! Unless... 
Marceline:::What?
Jake::: 
Jake::: 
Marceline:::What are you doing?
Jake:::I'm cooking up a crazy vampire! That should heat up nice! The sand will keep the meat moist.
Marceline:::You're gonna eat me?
Jake:::You was gonna eat me!
Marceline:::Yes, I am. 
Jake::: Cook, baby, cook!
Jake:::Finn!
Finn::: Bleh. The trick is rollin' it. Phew! Check out this ruby I got.
Jake:::That's an emerald, dude.
Finn:::You too now?! Emeralds are green, boyee.
Jake:::This thing is green.
Finn:::Why is everybody messin' with me? It's like a dark gray-ish red. Mostly gray. Sometimes red things are gray!
Jake:::You're a little colorblind... and there's nothin' to be ashamed of!
Finn:::Oh... whoops.
Jake:::I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far.
Finn:::Uh, what's goin' on with Marcy?
Jake:::She was threatening to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her. I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice.
Jake:::I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What?
Finn:::Chill, man!
Jake:::No, we gotta book!Go!
Marceline::: Go where, Jake?I gotta suck out your insides first, right?
Finn:::Nay-nay, brah!
Marceline:::Time to eat!Huh? What the—?
Finn:::Bubblegum?
Jake:::Yeah, but watch out for Marceline. She's gone rabid!
Princess Bubblegum:::What? Marceline's gonna rap for me?
Marceline::: Woof. Thanks, Bonnie. That's enough low-grade red to get me home, at least. Come on, guys. Let's go.
Finn:::Are you alright, PB?
Princess Bubblegum::: Did you get the Spoon of Prosperity?
Finn::: Yeah, here you go. 
Finn, Jake, & Marceline:::Whoa.
Princess Bubblegum:::Peeps will never starve in my eternal empire. Sand worm, up!
