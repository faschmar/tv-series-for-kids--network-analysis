Finn:::Haha! Time to protect the sun!
Jake:::Ha ha! Yeah, he knows how to get things started.
Finn:::Firepit number 1. Easy-peasy, livin' greasy! You wonder why they even put it there.
Jake:::It's probably a computel gleetch.
Jake:::Now comes some real trouble! It's Bouncy Bee! He's gonna get that sun, man!
Finn:::Haha! Please.Bleep!
Finn:::I had my eyes closed on that one!
Jake:::Yeah, that was cool. Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude, go back!
Finn:::I ain't in it for the money, man. I'm in it to crush the enemies of the sun. Like this sloppy butt right here.
Jake:::Hunny Bunny!
Finn:::I'm like, Hunny Bunny, don't you ever learn? I've always got the bomba! 
Jake:::Man, you are hot tonight! Think you can do it this time? Can you beat Sleepy Sam?!

Finn:::Okay! Here goes.
Finn and Jake together:::Up, down, left, left, right, right, down-
Jake:::Spin, down, up, left, faster, dude! Right, left, down!
Finn:::Aww! Every time!BMO, this game is the worst! If we were really inside that game, man, we would crush Sleepy Sam. Breezily! With my mitts!
BMO:::Oh no! It's much more dangerous than you think!
Finn:::Whoa, whoa, wait!
Jake:::BMO, is there a way for us to get in the game for real?
BMO:::Yes, of course, Jake.If I push this button-
BMO:::If I push this button, you will both be dangerously transported into my main brain game frame where it is very dangerous!
Finn:::Oh, man. Oh, BMO! You gotta let us in that game!
BMO:::No! It's a far too dangerous incredible adventure for you! It's final.
Finn:::Oh. Okay, BMO. Well, time for bed!
Jake:::...Finn?
Finn:::Time for bed. Right, Jake? 
Jake:::...oh, right! Heh heh. Good night, BMO.Time for bed! 
Finn:::We're in the game!
Jake:::Look! There's the sunshine we gotta protect!And there's a hole we're supposed to go down!And there's you...doing whatever you're doing. 
Finn::: I'm looking at my bits! My leg is math!
Jake::: Mmm. That sunshine feels good. Feels good all over!
Finn::: No wonder all the monsters in this game want to get their grubby mitts on it! Let's go kick their digital bootays!Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo doo! Doo!
Jake:::Beep boop! Beep boop!
Finn:::  We are in the computer world. We're computer boys, not computer girls. 
Jake:::  In a game, I can be who I virtually am. 
Finn:::  I can walk and sing, I can kill Silly Sam! 
Jake:::  Hey, what stinks?Smells like...

Finn::: Jake!
Jake::: 
Finn::: Dude! What if losing all your lives in here makes you die in real life? Or worse?!
Jake::: ...that makes me just want to sit here and feel bad.
Finn::: No way, man! We're gonna cross that hole! With real-world grit! Come on!
Finn::: Faster, Jake! Get ready to stretch it!
Finn::: Watch out, Jake! 
Jake::: Ow! Whew! That was pretty intense, dude!

Jake::: Let's get outta here, Finn!
Finn::: Man, we've never run away from Hunny Bunny!
Finn::: Firepit, Bouncy Bee, Hunny Bunny. They're supposed to be the easy parts! They're all hard as butts! Sleepy Sam is gonna be the ultimate butt-kicker!
Jake::: Look, Finn. The most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin.
Finn::: Man, get a hold of your brains! We need to stay alert for Sleepy Sam!
Jake::: Hey, that's him right there! 
Finn::: Get down!What's he doing? He's probably trying to psych me out!I'm gonna break you, Sam. When I'm done, they'll call you...uh, Stinky Sam. Stupid Frog.
Finn:::  M-m-my mitts didn't- didn't work! Come on, help me punch him!
Jake::: Okay!
Jake::: Let's get outta here, man! We're gonna die!
Finn::: I can see the light! We're almost there!
Finn::: Oh no, man. It's the edge of the screen! We're trapped and they'll be here any second.
Jake::: Wait, dude! The bomba!
Finn::: We can't get the bomba!
Jake::: Wait, dude.Hmm.
Finn::: Jake? Jake!
Jake::: What if I...? 
Finn::: That's not how it works!

Sleepy Sam::: Oh boy, that feels good!
Hunny Bunny::: Alright! See ya later, Sam! 
Finn:::  You mean, that's it? You're not gonna kill us?
Sleepy Sam:::  Of course not. The game's over; we won! All we wanted was the sunshine. And to kill that computer that's been imprisoning us for so many years.
Finn::: ...what?
BMO::: Help! Oh no!
Finn and Jake::: BMO!
Sleepy Sam::: Oh sure. He's dangerous! If he hits his button again, back we go.
Finn::: BMO, quick! Hit your button!
BMO::: I can't, Finn! I'm stuck!
Sleepy Sam::: You want him to hit his button? What's wrong with you?!
