Finn::: Hurry, Lady!
Finn:::It's happening again.
Princess Bubblegum::: That's right, Finn.
Finn::: Princess!
Princess Bubblegum::: The zombie infection has spread across the kingdom once again, ...and once again, it's all my fault.
Princess Bubblegum:::I was testing a sample of the zombie flesh I had saved when Cinnamon Bun came into the lab. He said he was hungry.
Cinnamon Bun::: I'm hungry.
Princess Bubblegum::: Not now, Cinnamon Bun. I'm busy. 
Princess Bubblegum:::And that's when I made my mistake. I should have paid more attention to that poor fool.The Candy Zombie flesh he ingested was highly contagious. 
Princess Bubblegum::: Cinnamon Bun? Where did you...EEEEHHHHH!!!
Zombie Cinnamon Bun::: Sugar!
Princess Bubblegum::: I escaped, but I wasn't able to stop Cinnamon Bun from infecting the rest of the kingdom. The good news is I still have all my notes for making the antidote formula.
Finn::: Oh, sweet!
Princess Bubblegum::: Let's board up the windows then we can get started.
Finn::: Princess!!
Princess Bubblegum::: Don't worry, Finn. You have the notes to my formula. Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH! 
Finn::: Nooo!!!
Lumpy Space Princess::: Get that zombie outta here!
Lumpy Space Princess::: Aw, nah! I am not getting eaten by zombies tonight.Get the lump outta here!!! Ahh! Ahh!
Finn::: Princess!
Jake::: These notes make no sense. It's all gobbledy-gak.
Finn::: Alright, we'll each make our own version of the formula. One of us is bound to get it right.
Finn::: Hmm?
Jake::: Hey, Princess Bubblegum trained her rat to dance. Neat.
Finn:::Done.
Lumpy Space Princess::: Done!
Jake & Lady::: Done!
Finn::: Bubblegum, I'm comin' for you!!!
Finn::: Mine first.
Winged Zombies::: Sugar!
Finn::: Cram!
Starchie::: Oh, my, that's a lot of zombies down there. Starchie's glad he's up here.Dang it!
Jake::: Let's get out of here!
Finn::: Stairs! 
Finn::: Jake, try yours and Lady's next!
Lumpy Space Princess::: Move outta the way! My formula is going to cure the zombies because I made the prettiest formula.
Lumpy Space Princess::: Oh. My. Glob. Look at those luscious lips. I gotta go lick up the rest of that formula! Aaaaaaah!My formula!Formula!Oh, my Glob. Yes, I'm gonna be hot! So freakin' hot!Yeah!
Finn::: LSP, look out!
Lumpy Space Princess::: Huh. I know you want this body, but you can't have it! You can't have it! 
Finn & Jake::: LSP!
Finn::: Dang it, Jake. We only got one formula left. Try yours and Lady's.
Jake::: Right.
Jake::: Let's hope this works.
Finn::: Wh-... where now?!
Jake::: We can barricade ourselves in the lab!
Finn::: Did anyone get bit?
Jake::: I think we're good. That door is made out of candy steel.
Jake::: What's the matter? 
Finn::: Jake! Did it get 'cha?
Jake::: I think I'm okay. It's just a little bite.
Lady Rainicorn::: Jake!
Jake::: It's all good, Sweetie. I can stretch forever. Hehehehe... Hey, let's hurry up with that antidote, huh, pal?Whooa...
Finn::: Okay, let's see here...
Jake:::You should try one of them books. Over there by the lab rat.
Finn::: Ha! Yeah, okay.Yes! This book has a glossary of symbols.
Jake:::That's great, buddy.
Finn::: Jake, I think this little guy has serious dance fever.
Jake::: Don't come near me, Sweetie!Oh, man, I'm outta shape. I think I should just stay in here, ya know. Just in case. Ya oh.
Jake::: Hurry, dude!
Finn::: I am! Okay, Jake's probably going turn into a zombie, which is okay. I just have to figure out this formula.
Lady Rainicorn::: Jake? Jake?
Lady Rainicorn::: Jake!
Finn::: Hang on, Lady! I'll have the antidote soon, but whatever you do, just don't let him out. He may look like the Jake that once loved you, but he's just a zombie!
Lady Rainicorn::: 아니야. 얘는 날 사랑해. ("No. He loves me.") 
Finn::: Hey, Lady... 
Finn::: The book!
Finn:::Sorry, everybody. Sorry, LSP, PB, Jake, LR, peepee poopoo doodoo.You know, it's funny; I don't even know your name.
Finn::: Yeah? What is it, girl?"Sci... ence." Your name is "Science"? Could it be?
PB::: Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH! 
Finn::: Hmm...
Finn::: Here goes nothing.
Jake::: Finn!
Finn::: Jake!
Jake::: You did it! I huh, uh... 
Finn::: Don't worry, Science. I've got a disgusting idea.OH, MY GLOB!!!
Jake::: Sorry about biting you, sugar.
Lady Rainicorn:::난 네가 깨물어 주는 게 좋아. ("I like it when you bite me.")
Jake:::Oh.
Princess Bubblegum::: And so the Royal Day of Apologizing has come to an end.And now I shall present the Royal Medal for Heroic Bravery. Finn the Human.
Finn::: Yes.
