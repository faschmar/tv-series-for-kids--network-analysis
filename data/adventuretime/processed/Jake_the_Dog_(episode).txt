Jake::: Nah, sandwich is good,maybe about... this big.... or this big. On ciabatta bread maybe... mmm I don't know, whatever you have is your choice.

Prismo::: You know... on someone who might need it.I'm talking about him over there!
Jake::: Oooh...
Mom::: Oh! Finn? Huh?

Jake:::Mmm, yeah, ah well, it's Finn's wish. Let's just see how it plays out. I got confidence in my boy!Besides, I'll hang onto my wish in case i need it.Awww!
Prismo::: Don't worry dude I gotcha covered!They're homemade.
Jake::: I love you Prismo.
Prismo::: Oh yee!! 
Jake::: I'm serious man, you're like a strong number three on my 'Cool Guys List.' Ah man, my dad use to make pickles , it's all he use to talk about, he'd obsess about them all the time, when I'd come in from playing he'd be like::: "Here, Jake, try these!"And they'd be pretty crunchy... actually you'd think they'd be soft but they weren't. I'd be like: "Wow dad! You'd made these pretty good!"Yeah, that was dad.
Prismo::: 
Finn::: Rise... my wintry warriors...
Trami::: Tromo!
Tromo::: Trami! Why am I cold and confused?!
Finn::: Fear not, icicle child! For I have brought you into a new life!
Tromo::: Eeh? The Mertens kid?
Finn::: The age of ice and whispering snow! 
Trami::: Hey, crack me loose T!
Tromo::: Come on!
Trami::: You see Big Destiny anywhere?
Big Destiny::: Big D's chillin' over here, wasteland style.
Finn::: Come back! Only I can protect ya'll.Stay...
Trami::: Aaa! My kicks!
Finn::: Can't you hear the- the whispers?
Tromo::: Forget Big D! Let's go!
Big Destiny::: I've taught you well, my traitorous gang.
Finn:::The voices... they tell me to freeze the world.
Big Destiny::: Get off of me, you weirdo!
Finn::: I am the end and the beginning. I am the hand of madness.Jake?
Prismo::: Dude, I get out of relationships because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna have for dinner every night! Cause when I'm alone I can just sit on the couch and I'm hungry I can eat whatever I want. It's not like:::"What should we eat for breakfast? Wait! We should coordinate!"That's a pain.
Jake:::Mm-mm, man your view of relationships is very bleak, don't you get lonely?
Prismo::: I have friends.
Cosmic Owl:::Hello, hello. Hey, so I brought over the-What is this singular doing in this realm?!
Prismo::: He's just here making a wish Cosmic Owl.
Cosmic Owl::: But I brought games! We were gonna hang!
Prismo::: ...after. Come on, get in here.

Jake::: Three, two, one... go!
Jake::: We're three nice dudes, havin' fun! We got warm bubble water, on our buns! I love this spa, and that's a fact! But if I stay too long, I get a pruny back! 
Finn::: Jake... Jake, what are you doing?
Lich/Jake::: 
Finn::: Back off my crown, Jake! I warn you!
Jake::: Hey man, I'm right here! That's not me man!
Lich/Jake:::Ah ha ha ha ha!
Finn::: 
Jake::: Finn! I'm in the spa bath! Oh man!
Prismo::: Maybe now, you would like to use your wish?
Jake:::Make Finn okay! I wish for a safe Finn! 
Prismo::: Wait, dude! Look, I like you, so you should know my wishes always got an ironic twist to them. It's like a monkey's paw kind of thing.
Jake:::What?
Prismo::: You just gotta be really specific. Say your wish is::: "I wish for a back rub." Who's gonna give it to you? A dirty man? A bear? And where does this "masseuse" come from? Do I zap some guy away from his family dinner? Leave some kid traumatized?
Cosmic Owl::: Woo!
Prismo:::Mom, where did dad go?Oh, I don't know son he just disappeared from the table... sorry.
Jake::: 
Prismo::: You see, Jake there are rules to this stuff, wishing an event to be changes elements before and after it. Memories will be destroyed, babies will not be born. Potential worlds could be evaporated by your wish!
Jake::: 
Prismo & Cosmic Owl:::Ewww! Uugh!
Jake:::I'm sorry, that's a lot of pressure man...
Prismo::: Focus, Jake!Here, eat this egg, it's brain food.
Jake:::Oh, okay. Ooo, think... think!
Prismo:::Okay, there is a way to bring back all life and get home.
Jake::: 
Prismo::: You just have to ch...

Jake:::Change the Lich's wish!
Prismo::: And go home.
Jake::: And go home! Okay, okay, I wish Lich's wish- was for me.
Prismo::: Aa-ah!
Jake::: And Finn, to go back home to Ooo!
Prismo::: I can work with that. Alright, this has been nice, see ya! 
Cosmic Owl::: Woo! 
Lich::: I wish- for the extinction of allli-i-if for Finn and Jake to go back home to Ooo. Huh!? No wait, what's not what I wished for!
Prismo::: Sorry guy, you only get one wish. Hey Jake, did you see that? Monkey's paw.
Finn::: Jake! What the? Why would the Lich wish... what? Jake?!
Jake:::It worked!
Finn::: Jake! This is serious! Something really messed up is happening!
Jake::: Ha ha! It already happened! And it never happened!
Princess Bubblegum::: What? What happened?!
Jake::: Nothing, cause I saved everybody!
Ice King::: Oh Honey, I told you, you can take the sign off when you tell me where you hid daddy's crown jewels.
Gunter::: Wenk!
Ice King::: Gunter! Huh?Woo wowsers!
Finn::: What's that?
Jake:::Hmm...
Prismo:::If you want to come back and hang out some time. Call me - P.
