Pat McHale::: In the dark recesses of the mind, a disease known as FEAR feasts upon the souls of those who cannot overcome its power...
Finn::: Come back, thief!
Jake::: Whoa!
Fire Newt::: Stop farting on me! It's gross!
Finn::: You can't just go around stealing boots.
Jake::: Yeah, and you know the penalty for stealing boots. It's poots... on newts.
Both::: 
Finn::: He's getting away in that lake!
Jake::: Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean.
Finn:::Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! ...Huh?
Finn::: Uhh...
Jake:::Poots on newts! Poots on newts!
Fire Newt::: No!
Jake:::Poots on newts!
Finn:::I'm coming, Jake. I'll poot on that newt as soon as I'm barefoot. Uh...
Finn:::Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts?
Finn::: Ow!
Finn::: Wh-wh-wh-Who are you?
Fear Feaster::: I am the manifestation of your fear... fear of the ocean!
Finn::: What? I'm not afraid of lakes, wells, or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles. Why would I be afraid of- 
Fear Feaster:::'Cause you're a wuss.
Finn::: I'm no wuss! I'm the hero around these parts!
Fear Feaster::: Ha! You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero.
Finn::: Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'!
Finn:::I shall conquer my fear.
Fear Feaster::: Yeah, right.
Finn::: No! I will. I'll conquer my fear.
Fear Feaster::: Of course you will,and I live in a two bedroom apartment that doesn't smell like vomit...Sarcasm.  
Jake::: Dude. Dude, did you see me? I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this! Womp! Womp! And then... Hey, what’s wrong with you, dude?
Finn::: Jake. I think I'm afraid... of the ocean.
Jake::: Say what, now?
Finn::: I need your help to overcome my fear. Will you do it?
Jake::: Um... No... I don't really wanna do it.
Finn::: Jake! Come on!
Jake::: I'm just messing with you. I'll do it. Hmm... Where to start? Oh, ok. I think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Jake's hand if you're scared.
Jake::: Um... Oh it's ok, dude. I see the problem. It's just your feet.
Jake:::Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop.
Finn::: Don't be scared. I shall not be scared.
Jake:::Boop. Boop.
Finn::: I'm afraid! Ah!Jake, get me out of the water! Now, Jake! Now! Now!
Jake::: Hot jam! You're really scared of the ocean. In fact, you're so scared... it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean!
Finn::: Jake!
Jake::: Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning.
Finn::: But I must conquer this now!I'm not afraid of you!
Finn::: ::: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Finn:::I'm afraid of you! I'm afraid of you! 
Finn:::Ok, yeah. Let's try tomorrow.
Jake::: Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up.
Finn:::Morning, Jake.
Jake::: Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear?
Finn::: Yeah, man.
Jake::: Cool... but I can only do this if you ask me.
Finn::: I'm askin'!
Jake::: Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one!
Finn:::Jake, are you crazy? This is not an OK thing to do!
Jake::: Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends.
Finn::: You're nuts. 
Jake::: Don't try to struggle, man.I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down.
Finn::: Really? Ok. I'm calming down.
Jake::: That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two?
Finn:::Yeah, man. I can do it.
Jake::: Alright, dude. Step... two! 
Finn:::Jake, this isn't a joke! It's touching me!
Jake::: Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child!
Finn:::I'm trying to let it hold me.
Jake::: Control your breathing!
Finn:::This isn't working!
Jake::: That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream.
Finn::: W-what?
Jake::: I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream.
Finn::: What?!
Jake::: Don't scream. Hold your breath, Finn. You got it, dude!
Finn::: Get me away, Jake! Now, Jake! Now! Right now! Get-Get me away! 
Jake::: Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow!
Finn:::I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do?
Jake::: I think we should give up.
Finn::: What? I made it all the way to level three.
Jake::: Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean thisis my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude.
Finn::: You have to help me. I can't do this without you.
Jake::: Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore.
Finn::: I swear I won't hit you anymore.
Jake::: And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times.
Finn::: I swear... and pigs have hair.
Jake::: Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four.
Finn::: What? I thought you said it was a three step plan... man.
Jake::: I'm not that good at counting.Come on. Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine... in the sea cucumber.
Jake::: Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude.
Finn:::Yeah. It's pretty math... you psychopath.
Jake::: You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes.
Finn:::Whoa...
Jake::: See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful.
Finn::: Hey. This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad.
Jake:::Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut.
Finn::: No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!
Finn::: Noooo!
Jake::: Saying, "Turn around" twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude.
Jake::: Hey, you swore!
Jake::: Ow! My bread and butter!
Jake::: No, dude! Don't!
Jake::: Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five.Here, put this on.
Jake::: Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab.
Jake::: No, dude! I said don't...
Finn::: Jake? Jaaaaaake!
Finn::: Jake!
Fear Feaster:::Pathetic! You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die! Your un-heroic body will never let you save Jake. 
Finn:::You're right.
Fear Feaster::: What? Really? You think I'm right? Well, that's... that's great!
Finn:::If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do.
Fear Feaster::: No. Wait. No! Noooo!
Finn::: Jake! Jake! Wake up!
Finn::: You ok, dude?
Jake::: Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear!
Finn::: What?
Jake::: You're at the bottom of the ocean!
Jake::: Maybe we should celebrate on land.
Jake::: I'm proud of you man. You did it!
Finn::: Thanks, dude.
Fear Feaster::: You've nothing to be proud of, boy! You will never get of your fear of the ocean!
Jake::: Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton?
Finn:::What the flip, man? I just swam to the bottom!
Fear Feaster::: No you didn't, cheater! You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero.
Finn::: He's right. I'll never be a hero.
Wise Man 1::: Finn, you are wrong. The mark of a great hero is his flaw.
Fear Feaster::: You know nothing, Wise Men!
Wise Man 1::: Silence, Fear Feaster! We know a lot!
Finn::: Wait... Why did you wait so long to tell me?
Wise Man 1::: Because the limo driver's flaw is being late!
Limo Driver:::Sorry. 
Wise Man 1::: Farewell, Finn. You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo.
Finn::: It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster!
Fear Feaster::: What? Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life?
Finn::: Everybody has a flaw... and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts.
Fear Feaster:::Wonderful...
Pat McHale::: And so fear is forced deep within the soul of a hero. Conquered... at least, for now...
