Princess Bubblegum:::Hello?
Finn::: Hi Princess! Would you go to Couples Movie Night with me?
Princess Bubblegum::: Sounds romantic, Finn.
Finn::: No! I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me. 
Princess Bubblegum::: No, sorry, Finn. I'm busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship.
Finn::: But—
Princess Bubblegum::: Auf Wiedersehen! ("Goodbye")
Finn::: She doesn't want to go!
Jake::: Yes she does! We just need to help her realize that she wants to go to the movies with you.I'm calling Marceline.
Finn::: What?
Jake:::Look, man, I've been learning a lot about vampires lately. I realized my fear was based on ignorance!
Marceline::: Speak.
Jake::: Hey, hey, Marceline. Got a favor to ask, Babe. We've gotta make Princess Bubblegum jealous, so she'll go to the movies with Finn.Marceline? Come in. Hello? 
Finn::: Hehe. Are you gonna help us?
Marceline::: Yeah, I'll help. It'll be funny.

Finn::: I, um... uh... it's... something.
Princess Bubblegum::: Well, then, keep it down out there! I'm trying to whistle practice! 
Jake::: That was great! Now, we begin Phase 2! It's so powerful! Wait here! Hehehe... 
Marceline::: Hey, look, Finn, I know Jake's your friend and all, but... if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've gotta like, stop taking advice from your dog and take some advice from a real girl!
Finn::: But Jake said Phase 2 is powerful!
Marceline:::How is Jake going to know what girls want more than a real girl?
Finn::: Yeah...
Marceline::: Okay great. So what we need now is something... fun! Girls love fun more than anything. Fun, fun, fun! If you can show Princess Bubblegum you're fun, she'll deffs wanna go to the movies with you.
Finn::: Haha, you said fun so much, it sounds all weird now. Fun. F—
Marceline::: So... what do you like to do for fun, Finn?
Finn::: Oh, Oh! I like to wrestle! And fight!But girls don't like that.
Marceline::: No, no, that's perfect! All you need to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum to show her how fun you are. 
Finn::: Ffffffuuunnn. Ffffuuunn. 
Jake::: Whoa, where you going, man? Check it out!
Finn::: What is that stuff?
Jake::: It's a lute-suit! Girls love it! Trust me.
Marceline::: Finn! What the plum are you wearing? You look horrible!
Jake::: It's a lute-suit! And Finn looks adorable in it!
Marceline::: Well, it's going to ruin the plan.
Jake::: What she talking about, Finn?
Finn::: Well... I was going to give Marceline's plan a try, too.
Jake::: Her idea?! What's wrong with my idea? 
Princess Bubblegum:::Oh, hey, Finn! Did'ya ever find some—Whoa! What are you wearing?
Finn::: Oh... this is my... Lute... suit.
Finn::: Oh.This is my lute-suit!
Princess Bubblegum:::Finn, that is hilarious!Oh, you are killing me! 
Marcelince::: Psst! 
Finn::: Oh, yeah!So... Headlock! 
Princess Bubblegum:::Guards!
Marceline::: That suit was ridiculous.
Jake::: Ridi—Ridiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can ya?
Finn::: Uh... I guess the suit did feel... a little silly.
Jake::: Well, fine! You can just give it back then!
Finn::: I'm sorry!
Jake::: Good luck getting to that movie without my help! Ruff. 
Marceline::: Gee, he seems pretty ticked.
Finn::: Naw, he just needs some spaghetti.
Marceline::: Oh, okay. Well taste this, then. I've gotta a new plan.
Finn::: Really?
Marceline::: The only thing women like more than fun is excitement! She needs to feel her blood pump, man! She needs to... be chased by wolves!
Finn::: Like metaphorically?
Marceline::: Come on, I'll teach ya how to show a girl a good time. Wraps Finn's arms around her.] Hold tight. You ready?
Finn::: Uhh...Mhmm.
Marceline::: Shhh! She's probably asleep!
Finn::: This was a really good idea.
Marceline:::Now don't blow it this time!
Finn::: Haha, okay.
Princess Bubblegum::: Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here! There's wolves in my room!
Finn::: Yeah, I know! I put them there! Pretty exciting, right? Heh heh.
Princess Bubblegum:::I'm sorry to do this, Finn. But until you stop acting like a psycho, you're forbidden from entering the Candy Kingdom. Farewell. 
Finn::: I don't understand, Marceline. I tried everything. I guess she just doesn't like me. 
Marceline::: Shhh. Come on, Finn, a brainlord like Bonnie? You'll be bored with her in a week! And anyway I, for one, think you're pretty great.Sorry it didn't work out the way you wanted. See you later, I guess! 
Finn::: Marceline! Of course! It's been Marceline all along!
Jake::: Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti?
Finn::: Ah, no, thanks, man. But I really need your help!
Jake::: 'Bout time!
Marceline::: Uh-oh.
Finn::: Marceline! Will you go to the movies with me?!
Marceline::: We need to talk...
Finn:::Good evening my dear, your escort is here!
Marceline::: Finn, you do NOT want to go down that road with me.
Finn::: With you, I would walk down any road, m'lady. Especially, if it leads to the movies.
Marceline::: Oh, yeah? No one would want to go to the movies with...this!What do you think of me now?
Finn::: How do you like your popcorn?
Marceline::: Uuugh!You're starting to annoy me!
Finn::: Well then let's do something fun, like go to the movies!
Marceline::: Get off me!Finn, I like you, but I—
Finn::: Headlock! 
Marceline::: No!Listen to me. I'm not going to go to the movies with you! I just don't like you... that way.
Marceline::: I'm sorry Finn, I just... I don't wanna date you.
Finn::: Date me? Man, I just wanna go to the movies. But everybody hates me.
Marceline::: Wait, you don't want me to be your girlfriend?
Finn::: Huh? No! Movies!
Marceline::: If you weren't looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day?
Finn::: 'Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else.
Jake::: I didn't really say all that. 
Marceline::: Of course I'll go with you, Finn!
Finn::: You will?
Marceline::: Yeah, as friends.
Finn::: Of course as friends!
Marceline::: But no tongue.
Finn::: Yea—Wha?
Finn::: Oh, man! I can't believe I'm finally going to see this movie!
Woman in movie::: Oh, mon cher. I guess zese is goodbye.
Man in movie::: No, not goodbye. Let's say::: Farewell!
Finn::: Couples Night sucks! Marceline, would you do me the honor, of getting the plop out of here?
Marceline::: There's nothing I'd like more. 
Man in movie::: Nothing can ever tear us apart.
