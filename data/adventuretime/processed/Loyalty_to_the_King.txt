Ice King:::Please! I'm trying to tell my Nice Knights something! 
Ice King:::Come here.The main enemy to the Nice King right now is the disorganization of his love life.
Finn::: W-well, what do you mean?
Ice King::: The ugly ones are all mixed up with the other ones! I need you to catalog them... or something.
Jake::: Tah ha, but we punch monsters.
Ice King::: After I choose my bride, then you can go punch the monsters.
Finn::: Managing admirers? We'll give it a try...
Finn::: Let's move onto something easier. Um, do you like drums?
Bee Princess::: Um, am I supposed to?
Jake::: She's dodging the question.
Bee Princess::: 
Finn::: Are you fond of men with magical abilities?
Ghost Princess::: I'm really nervous right now... I-I just really want to meet a nice king.
Jake::: You can go back to the waiting room now, ma'am!
Ghost Princess::: I screwed it up, didn't I! 
Jake::: I think we did a good job.
Finn::: I don't feel good making a princess cry, this is not how knights are suppose to act.
Jake::: Finn, knights are loyal to their king.
Finn::: I'm still not sure...
Jake::: Aa Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Loyalty to the King! 
Finn::: Can't argue with that!
Ice King:::Hey, Nice Knights, Turtle Princess is about to walk out that door, I told her that I like her a lot, but I really don't like her all that much, could you guys break it off for me?
Finn::: The Nice King is not looking for a relationship right now.
Jake::: Get out of here!
Turtle Princess::: 
Finn:::He's just not ready for a relationship!
Jake::: Alright! We did it, dude! 
Finn:::I feel terrible, I need to talk to the Nice King about this.
Ice King::: Yes, yes, keep walking in a circle. 
Finn::: Nice King, may I speak with you for a moment?
Ice King::: Princesses, I must speak with my knight in private. Go on back into your cage.
Princesses::: Bye, Nice King. 
Ice King::: What's up, knight?
Finn::: I don't like treating princesses this way, I don't wanna... I don't wanna do this anymore.
Ice King:::Your loyalty is in question?
Finn::: Oh, it's not that. It's just, princesses are suppose to be treated with niceness.
Ice King:::Are you implying that I'm not the nice king!
Finn::: Hey, what's wrong with you!
Ice King::: 
Lumpy Space Princess::: Hey, I'm here.
Ice King::: Ugh, Finn, get rid of her.
Finn::: What?! No, man!
