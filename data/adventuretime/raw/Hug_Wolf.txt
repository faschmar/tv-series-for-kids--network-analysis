{{L|[''The episode begins showing a [[Tree of Blight|black tree]]. It turns to show its face.'']}}
{{L|[[Finn]]| The Tree of Blight.}}
{{L|[''The tree roars in the center of a dark forest; the camera pans out to show Finn and [[Jake]].'']}}
{{L|Finn| Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land.}}
{{L|Jake| Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's. [''The duo walks forward.''] Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods.}}
{{L|[''The [[Beautiful Lady|Alpha Hug Wolf]] suddenly lunges out and Finn and Jake gasp. She lands next to the duo and punches Finn rather softly.'']}}
{{L|Alpha Hug Wolf| Huuugs!}}
{{L|Finn| What the—?! Is this an extra butt?! [''Pushes her away.''] Quick, Jake! Burn the tree!}}
{{L|[''Jake runs off.'']}}
{{L|Alpha Hug Wolf|Huuuugs! [''Finn grunts and they begin circling each other''] Gonna hug you up, boy! I'm gonna snuggle you to pieces!}}
{{L|Jake| Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over!}}
{{L|Finn| No! [''Gasps as the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf makes a roaring charge at him. The ‎Alpha Hug Wolf embraces Finn and howls.''] Jake, hurry!}}
{{L|Jake| Is he crushin' you, man?!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Lowering his voice slightly''] No, he's just... hugging me gently!}}
{{L|Jake| Oh...! [''Turns and talks to tree''] When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Jake says, "Hello."}}
{{L|[''Jake sets the tree on fire which makes it explode; a piece of the tree lands on the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf and she runs off screaming. Finn is violently coughing.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hey, buddy, you okay?}}
{{L|Finn| Didn't even tell me its name...}}
{{L|Jake| Wha..,?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Noticing the tree is burned down''] Oh, sweet! Ha-ha-ha!}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| [''In unison''] Hot to the touch!}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Finn and Jake's Tree Fort. Jake is whistling and playing [[Portender Defender]] on [[BMO]]. He notices Finn is hugging BMO and stops playing.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy?}}
{{L|Finn| I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps.}}
{{L|Jake| Hmm... [''Feels Finn's forehead''] You've got a fever, man.}}
{{L|Finn| I feel hot. [''Holds BMO tighter'']}}
{{L|BMO| Finn, you're hurting me.}}
{{L|Jake| I think you need a good night's sleep.}}
{{L|[''Scene transition to Finn and Jake's bedroom. Finn is seen hugging a pillow and Jake blows out a candle. Finn whines like a dog in his sleep. Cut to the next day; Finn and Jake are picking up litter in the [[Candy Kingdom]].'']}}
{{L|Jake| You feelin' better today?}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah. I feel like a million clams.}}
{{L|Jake| Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter? [''Eats some of it''] Litter for lunch! Mmm!}}
{{L|[''Finn continues picking it up and [[Cinnamon Bun]] enters and runs into Finn.'']}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| Huh? Not again!}}
{{L|Finn| What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun?}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night.}}
{{L|Finn| Uh... I didn't hug you last night.}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| Yes, you did! My love handles still hurt! You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze—a really strong one! [''Groans in pain'']}}
{{L|[''Jake joins in.'']}}
{{L|Finn| CB says I hugged 'im. Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya. [''Laughs; Cinnamon Bun also starts to laugh. Jake just makes a worried face. Cinnamon Bun exits as his laugh fades. Finn and Jake sit down.''] Oh, Cinnamon Bun. [''Eats some candy litter''] [''Muffled''] What a crazy story, buddy.}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy.}}
{{L|Finn| Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you?}}
{{L|Jake| I'm just sayin' you were really clingy.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Eats more litter''] [''Muffled''] But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun.}}
{{L|Jake| No. I have a theory, ...but I don't like it.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to a library.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right?}}
{{L|Finn| ...So...?}}
{{L|[''Jake pulls out a [[Bestiarium Vocabulum|book]] and drops it on the ground. Jake opens it.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is. [''Reading book''] "[[Hug Wolves|Hug wolves]]—a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon."!}}
{{L|Finn| Like last night!}}
{{L|Jake| Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature.}}
{{L|Finn| Well, how can I get uncursed?}}
{{L|Jake| Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure.}}
{{L|Finn| Uh... I'm scared, Jake... [''Attempts to hug Jake but he slaps him away'']}}
{{L|Jake| No hugs!!}}
{{L|Finn| I'm sorry! [''Grunts''] I feel hot! Rrrrr!!}}
{{L|[''Jake looks worried. Cut back to the [[Tree Fort]] where Jake is covering Finn with bags of frozen peas. BMO is whimpering.'']}}
{{L|Jake| What's wrong, BMO?}}
{{L|BMO| I am terrified of Finn.}}
{{L|Jake| Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you. [''BMO stops shielding himself in disbelief''] You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??}}
{{L|Finn| I think so.}}
{{L|Jake| I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah. I heard you. I said I think so.}}
{{L|Jake| I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout.}}
{{L|Finn| Oh. Okay. IS THIS GOOD?!?}}
{{L|Jake| Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel?}}
{{L|Finn| Prickly and painful.}}
{{L|Jake| Good, good, you're doin' great!}}
{{L|Finn| Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now?}}
{{L|Jake| No, you can't hug anything.}}
{{L|Finn| But that poor cactus! It... it... NEEDS ME! [''Stands up and knocks bags of peas off body, knocking Jake down. He pants heavily then growls.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Growling fiercely''] I want to hug you, Jake! Close!}}
{{L|[''Jake ties Finn up with rope then chains him down.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Finn... say something to reassure me.}}
{{L|Finn| I'LL HUG YOUR [[Margaret|MOM]]!}}
{{L|[''Jake makes a frightened noise and backs away quickly.'']}}
{{L|BMO| Jake! We need the silver baseball!}}
{{L|[''The full moon outside is shown and shines from behind the clouds. Finn completes his transformation.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hrrugs!! HUGS FOR BUDDIES! [Howls]}}
{{L|BMO| Oh, Glob! Oh, my Glob, Jake! Mama!}}
{{L|Finn| Bring it in, guys!}}
{{L|BMO| Screamoooo!}}
{{L|Jake| BMO! Strobe light mode! [''BMO activates his strobe lights.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Not cool!}}
{{L|Jake| Back, beast!}}
{{L|Finn| Hug wolf, away!}}
{{L|[''Finn busts out of a window howling and runs to the Candy Kingdom. The scene cuts there.'']}}
{{L|[[Mr. Cupcake]]| Surely this frosted drink will soothe my fevered tempers. [''Finn pants heavily and his POV is viewed as he watches Mr. Cupcake and goes towards him.''] Hellooo? Good heavens! A lycanthrope! AAAAH!!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Hugs him''] Hug you up, bro! [''Grunts and roars as Mr. Cupcake groans'']}}
{{L|[''Finn jumps to the [[Gumdrop teenager]]'s balcony and enters her room and creeps towards her in bed'']}}
{{L|Gumdrop teenager| Dracula? AAAAH!! Eeee!!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Roaring''] HUUUUGS!!}}
{{L|[''The [[Gumdrop Dad]] bursts in holding a [[Candy cane shotgun]].'']}}
{{L|Gumdrop dad| Get away from my daughter, ya hairy teenager! [''Mimicking the sound a shotgun makes when one cocks it''] Ch-ch... [''Mimics a gunshot noise and shoots the teenager's mirror.'']}}
{{L|Gumdrop teenager| Aaah!!}}
{{L|Gumdrop dad| Ch-ch. [''Fake gunshot noise; repeats a couple of times as Finn runs away''] Ch-ch. [''Goes towards window''] Eh... eh... SHE'LL NEVER MARRY! [''Chases Finn away with more gunfire'']}}
{{L|[''Transition to the next day; Jake is walking with BMO in the Candy Kingdom.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Finn? Finn?}}
{{L|BMO| There he is!}}
{{L|[Finn is in a river. Jake shakes him awake.]}}
{{L|Finn| Huh? Huh? [''[[Princess Bubblegum]] chases a cat in the background''] What... What happened? Jake... what happened to me last night?}}
{{L|Jake| You hugged... everyone.}}
{{L|Finn| NO!}}
{{L|[''[[Candy People]] appear and shout angrily'']}}
{{L|[[Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone]]| We're mad, but we're not gonna go down there.}}
{{L|Finn| People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe, ...and because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to the Candy Dungeon.'']}}
{{L|[[Candy Baby]]| Why's Finn in the cage, Mama? Isn't hugs nice?}}
{{L|[[Candy Mother]]| Oh, baby... [''Hugs him in concern'']}}
{{L|Jake| Candy People, let's make sure that Alpha Hug Wolf pays for what he's done!!}}
{{L|Candy Person #29| Yeah!}}
{{L|Candy Person #33| Yeah, I agree with the last guy!}}
{{L|Jake| Cinnamon Bun, you watch over Finn!}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| Uuuuuhhhh...}}
{{L|Jake| Let's go, boys!!}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| Uh... bu-, bububut...}}
{{L|Crowd| No more hugs! No more hugs! No more hugs!}}
{{L|Random Candy Person| Without consent!!}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| Uh...}}
{{L|Finn| Huh? [''Watches full moon appear from behind clouds and gasps''] HUUUGS!! [''Growls'']}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| Finn? [''Finn keeps growling as he transforms.''] Uh...}}
{{L|Finn [''Fully transformed'']| Cinnamon Bun... let me out...}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| I-I-I-I'm not supposed to.}}
{{L|Finn| Don't you want a hug?}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| I can't, man!}}
{{L|Finn| Not even a little one?}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| Uuuuhhh...}}
{{L|Finn| You want a hug?}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun| [''Mutters''] YES!! HUG ME!!!! [''To himself''] C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon... [Unlocking door] Which way does this turn?!? [''Finn lunges out with a roar and tackles Cinnamon Bun.''] Owww! Ow, my sides.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to the forest from the beginning of the episode.'']}}
{{L|Candy crowd| SAY NO TO HUGS!}}
{{L|Jake| I smell someone bein' hugged right now! [''Spots ‎Alpha Hug Wolf hugging an [[antelope]].'']}}
{{L|Antelope| Uh... I have a wife.}}
{{L|Jake| That hug be your last, demon!}}
{{L|[Jake stretches his arms and repeatedly punches the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf]}}
{{L|Alpha Hug Wolf| Rrr...still love you! [''Attempts to embrace Jake's arms but misses''] Raaah! Come here, baby!}}
{{L|Jake| No huggies! [''‎Alpha Hug Wolf lands in front of Jake and the crowd. The crowd mutters, frightened.''] Eh... Finn... I've failed you.}}
{{L|[''Suddenly, Finn lunges out in the same way the Alpha Hug Wolf did at the beginning of the episode and tackles her. They commence their "hug battle."'']}}
{{L|Alpha Hug Wolf| I'm gonna hug you up.}}
{{L|Finn| You call that a hug?}}
{{L|[''They continue their battle.'']}}
{{L|Jake| This is the biggest hug that's ever existed!}}
{{L|[''Finn and the wolf begin sparking as they battle. The ‎Alpha Hug Wolf forces Finn near a cliff, but Finn gets a hold of her before she can push him off. They both start glowing; they howl as soon an explosion occurs and forms a heart-shaped cloud that blows several [[mountain goat]]s away. The smoke clears.'']}}
{{L|Finn [''Back to normal'']| Uuuugghhh... Huh? [''Finn notices that the ‎Beautiful Lady is also back to normal; she lets out tired groans''] You... You stopped hugging me.}}
{{L|Beautiful Lady| Yeah... You stopped, too.}}
{{L|Finn| I just... didn't feel like I needed any more hugs.}}
{{L|Beautiful Lady| Me neither.}}
{{L|Candy Person #29| The curse is broken!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Runs up to her''] Can I get a hug?}}
{{L|Finn| [''disgusted''] JAKE!!!!!}}
{{L|[''Suddenly, the girl turns into another screeching Tree of Blight'']}}
