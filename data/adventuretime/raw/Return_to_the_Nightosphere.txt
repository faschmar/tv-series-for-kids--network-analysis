{{L|Finn|Oh. Heh heh. What? Where are we?}}
{{L|Jake|I dunno.}}
{{L|Finn|What did we do last night?}}
{{L|Jake|Mayhaps we drank juice of the [[Elder Toad]].}}
{{L|Finn|Eh, I doubt it. Yo, do you see this? We're in a cage! Do you think we, like, did something wrong?}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, right. When did we ever did wrong actions? Get real. [''takes out his cellphone'']}}
{{L|Finn|Who ya calling?}}
{{L|Jake|I'm callin' BMO, see if he knows what happened. [''mutters''] Junk... My new [[Jake's phone#New phone|camera phone]]... Wait, c'mere!}}
{{L|Finn|What?}}
{{L|Jake|I guess I vid-taped a buttload of stuff on here.}}
{{L|Finn|Play it for the clues within.}}
{{L|Jake|Okay, play. [''clicks play button on his phone'']}}
{{L|[''Static on phone'']}}
{{L|Finn [''on phone'']|Did you take it yet?}}
{{L|Jake [''on phone'']|Recording.}}
{{L|Finn [''on phone'']|Okay, get a shot of the portal.}}
{{L|[''Jake moves the phone to reveal a blue swirling vortex that is apparently a Nightosphere portal'']}}
{{L|Finn [''on phone'']|Gonna go through this biz!}}
{{L|Jake [''on phone'']|Alright, let's do—[''screen goes blank, video ends'']}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, no! What?!}}
{{L|Jake|Battery crunked out.}}
{{L|Finn|Dude, do you remember any of that mess?}}
{{L|Jake|No, but I guess we're here on purpose?}}
{{L|Finn|So we opened a portal to somewhere, but where? [''walks to the bars on the cage where a jailer demon is standing'']}}
{{L|[[Demon Guard|Nightosphere Jailer]]|The [[Nightosphere|Nightosphere]].}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|[''both scream''] AHHHhhhh...}}
{{L|Nightosphere Jailer|You're in the Nightosphere.}}
{{L|Finn|Are you sure?}}
{{L|Nightosphere Jailer|Uh, yes. You got thrown in jail. Look. [''flies up to a light switch and pushes it down, lighting up cages along the walls full of howling demons'']}}
{{L|Jake|Look!}}
{{L|Finn|[''gasps'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to a shot of a statue of Marceline's father.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Marceline's dad! We really are in the Nightosphere!}}
{{L|Nightosphere Jailer|Up an' at em, people. [''opens cages''] Eveyone out of your cages. My shift is over, and no one's shown up, so...}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa, wait. You're letting us go?}}
{{L|Nightosphere Jailer|I mean... yeah, but not really. You're in the nightosphere, so...}}
{{L|Finn|So what?}}
{{L|Jake|[''holds up cellphone and charger''] Is there an outlet somewhere for this?}}
{{L|Nightosphere Jailer|[''laughing loudly'']}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, c'mon! Just tell us how we can get back to our world.}}
{{L|Nightosphere Jailer|You can't leave the Nightosphere. Not unless ''he'' let's you. [''points to statue'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|Marceline's dad.}}
{{L|Nightosphere Jailer|Yeah, that's [[Hunson Abadeer]]. He runs this place.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to a plaque under the statue that says, "HUNSON ABADEER: OUR GREAT LEADER IS WITH US FOR ALL ETERNITY" and a large caterpillar-like demon runs between the statues legs.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hunson Abadeer? [''giggles''] Alright.}}
{{L|Finn|Well, dude, how do we talk to him?}}
{{L|Nightosphere Jailer|You can't just talk to the boss. You gotta make an appointment.}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, but we don't even know why we're here!}}
{{L|Jake|[''holding up a banana''] And what's up with this?}}
{{L|Nightosphere Jailer|Ugh. Oh! Oh, oh, sick! You touched that stuff?!}}
{{L|[''Jake looks at the banana questioningly.'']}}
{{L|Nightosphere Jailer|Later, fools. [''goes away'']}}
{{L|[''Demons cheer.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''trying to get the demons' attention''] Hey! Hey! Is there an outlet anywhere? You guys...}}
{{L|Finn|Maybe this is where they put all the dummy demons. [''cuddles a caterpillar demon and talks to it in a baby-like voice''] Right, big guy? You're not so smart, right? Yeah... [''to Jake; normal voice''] Let's go out that hole, man.}}
{{L|Jake|Okay, get on.}}
{{L|[''Finn climbs on his back, and Jake stretches up through the hole. They climb out and see various scenes of chaos.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Mm-hm, mm-hm. Pretty neat.}}
{{L|[''A reddish cloud flies overhead and obliterates a mountain with a green ray.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa, look!}}
{{L|[''Cloud shoots more rays.'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to a demon kid playing with tiny demons.'']}}
{{L|Demon dad|[''to his kid''] Charlie, don't socialize with the smaller demons! They're dirty and stupid!}}
{{L|[''Ray strikes the dad, turning him into a bunch of little demons.'']}}
{{L|Charlie|Daddy!}}
{{L|[''Cloud shoots a mountain, turning it into a sculpture of Hunson Abadeer's head.'']}}
{{L|Finn|What is that?}}
{{L|Jake|I think it's like sentient blood mist.}}
{{L|Finn|Cool.}}
{{L|Jake|C'mon, let's see if anyone knows where Hunson Abadeer is.}}
{{L|Finn|Alright, well, how about that dude? [''points to a one-eyed pink demon which is cut open like a cross section so you can see his guts'']}}
{{L|Jake|Okay.}}
{{L|Finn|[''to the demon and the little demons traveling on him''] Yo, bros! How do we talk to Hunson Abadeer?}}
{{L|[[Half Monster Demon]]|[''telepathically''] The teller can help you. Get in my flipping belly, and I will transport you. My insides are habitable. You will not be digested.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake climb in, and the demon flies them over to a river full of little demons.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Bye, mister! [''Looks around''] Who's the teller? That guy? [''He looks toward a birdlike demon in a rowboat rowing on top of the little demons. The [[Demons#Boat Demon|Boat Demon]] bangs one of the small ones with an oar.'']}}
{{L|Boat Demon|Okay, bozos, make room, make room, make room!}}
{{L|Small Demon|Ouch! Come on!}}
{{L|Boat Demon|Scooch over, fatty.}}
{{L|Small Demon|I can't, dude. This outbox is packed tighter than my tummy tunnel when I can't make brown on the camping trips because of my anxieties and I have IBS also. [''gets hit with oar''] Ow!}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, guy, are you the teller?}}
{{L|Boat Demon|No, no, no, this is the line to ''meet'' the teller.}}
{{L|Finn|No, man, are you for real? How long's the wait?!}}
{{L|Boat Demon|I dunno. I just like to row around on top of their heads.}}
{{L|Finn|Bunk that!}}
{{L|Jake|[''holds up the banana''] Hey, do you know about this?}}
{{L|Boat Demon|I... ew, no. [''scoffs''] Sick.}}
{{L|Finn|Why do we need to see the teller anyway? We just wanna see Hunson Abadeer and find out what happened to us!}}
{{L|Boat Demon|The teller will get you in touch with Hunson Abadeer. We got systems down here. You gotta swim the proper channels, ya know?}}
{{L|Small Demon|Youse ain't special! Youse gotta wait just like the rest of youse... [''corrects himself''] Us.}}
{{L|Finn|[''sighs''] Where's the line start?}}
{{L|Boat Demon|Oh... I dunno. The thing sorta governs itself.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake climb into the river and squeeze in between the demons.'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|[''grimace as they squeeze in''] Tight!}}
{{L|[''Boat Demon rows over their heads.'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|Ow!}}
{{L|[''Finn moans.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''looking at the boat demon''] That guy stinks.}}
{{L|Finn|[''to a big demon''] Excuse me! Excuse me! Big man? Over here!}}
{{L|[[Demons#Big Demon|Big Demon]]|Huh? What, me?}}
{{L|Finn|Uh, yeah, how long have you been in line for?}}
{{L|Big Demon|How... long? [''shudders and starts crying'']}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, butt traps. Jake, stretch us to the front.}}
{{L|All demons|NO CUTTING!!!}}
{{L|Big Demon|I will kill you with all my hopes and regrets!}}
{{L|Finn|All right, dudes, chill! We'll wait! [''whistles'']}}
{{L|[''Time card: TWO DAYS LATER'']}}
{{L|Finn|I can't feel my legs.}}
{{L|[''Time card: FOUR DAYS LATER'']}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake are both quietly crying'']}}
{{L|[''Time card: EIGHT DAYS LATER'']}}
{{L|Finn|SAY SOMETHING!! Say something to me!!!}}
{{L|Jake|I... can't. I got nothing to say anymore.}}
{{L|Finn|Just make up words then!}}
{{L|Jake|Bloobity bloo bloo blah blee blee blah. Shree shrah...}}
{{L|[''Time card: THIRTEEN DAYS EIGHTEEN HOURS LATER'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, check it out. We're at the front of the line.}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|Woohoo!}}
{{L|Finn|[''to the teller''] Yo, yo! We wanna talk to Abadeer!}}
{{L|[[Teller]]|Wha... Huh? [''hands Finn a slip of paper with a number on it''] When your thingy comes up, Hunson Abadeer will see you through the door.}}
{{L|Finn|[''reading from paper''] 42 million?! What's the number on the door?}}
{{L|[''The door reads 41,999,999.'']}}
{{L|Jake|41 million... [''mutters gibberish''] We're next! Whew! Man, I thought I was gonna throw up!}}
{{L|[''The number changes to 42 million.'']}}
{{L|Finn|That's us!}}
{{L|Jake|Yaaay! [''sees that there is another extremely long line''] Nooooooo!}}
{{L|Finn|I'm gonna lose it! Waaaaaaaaaaahhh... [''he continues screaming like this for quite some time'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, do you know if there's an outlet anywhere?}}
{{L|Two-headed Demon|No.}}
{{L|Jake|Do you know what this is all about? [''holds up banana'']}}
{{L|Two-headed Demon|No... gross.}}
{{L|[''Finn stops screaming and is lying face down on the ground, exhausted.'']}}
{{L|Jake|What's going on, buddy? You givin' up?}}
{{L|Finn|[''sighs''] I guess.}}
{{L|Jake|You don't wanna just stick it out a little more?}}
{{L|Finn|I don't know if my little boy heart can take it.}}
{{L|Jake|Listen, Finn. Are you listening?}}
{{L|Finn|Mm-hmm.}}
{{L|Jake|Your heart may be small, but it's strong as a bull donk. And I know. You can wait through this line so we can meet Hunson Abadeer and find out why we're here, and why we're in a pile of banianials, 'cause you're a champ, OK?}}
{{L|Finn|[''shrugs''] Ok.}}
{{L|Jake|上手で頑張ってね ("Being that you are skilled you can do it!")}}
{{L|Finn|Well, at least I can see the end of the line, I think. Let's wait the heck out of this line!}}
{{L|Jake|That's it, champ. [''Finn starts to jog in place''] Hehehehe, you're pretty pumped up.}}
{{L|Finn|I'm super pumped!}}
{{L|Cloud|Does anyone need to go pee-pees?}}
{{L|[''One demon raises his hand.'']}}
{{L|Cloud|Go ahead.}}
{{L|[''The demon runs ahead of line.'']}}
{{L|Okay, who's here with a question for Mr. Abadeer?}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake raise their hands.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, yeah, we've got questions.}}
{{L|[''The cloud destroys the demons who raised their hands.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''gasps''] Put your hand down, Finn!}}
{{L|Finn|No way, dude, I got questions.}}
{{L|[''Jake goes away with Finn.'']}}
{{L|Finn|What the hey, Jake!}}
{{L|Jake|It's not answering questions, man. That thing is gonna bake our beans.}}

{{L|Jake|[''Points to cloud''] Look.}}
{{L|[''The cloud goes inside a cave'']}}
{{L|Jake|Ride me, partner. [''Jake acts like a horse'']}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake run to the cave.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, cloud! Where's Abadeer? Whoa, look at all these paintings. I think this is Hunson Abadeer's house.}}
{{L|[''The cloud arrives and reveals he's Abadeer.'']}}
{{L|Hunson Abadeer|Hey!}}
{{L|Finn|Hunson Abadeer!}}
{{L|Hunson Abadeer|How dare you chumps trespass here!}}
{{L|Jake|We just wanna go home, man.}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, why'd you lock us up, Abadeer? When Marceline finds out about this, it's gonna stir up some heavy daddy-daughter issues.}}
{{L|Hunson Abadeer|NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE!}}
{{L|Jake|Ah, come on, man!}}
{{L|[''Hunson Abadeer attacks Finn and Jake.'']}}
{{L|Hunson Abadeer|NO ONE! NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE!}}
{{L|[''Abadeer attacks Finn, but Finn blocks it with his sword. Jake tries to open a door, but Abadeer sees him.'']}}
{{L|Hunson Abadeer|Come with me, you juicy, little mortal soul!}}

{{L|Jake|We don't want to hurt you, Abadeer. Just let us go.}}
{{L|[''Abadeer laughs and throws Jake against the portal wall.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''groans'']}}
{{L|[''Abadeer tries to suck his soul, but Finn stabs him in the head. Black goo starts to squirt out.'']}}

{{L|[''Marceline emerges from Abadeer's head.'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|[''in unison''] MARCELINE?!}}
{{L|[[Marceline]]|I'm gonna close this portal. [''hisses''] You're forbidden to come back to the Nightosphere!}}
