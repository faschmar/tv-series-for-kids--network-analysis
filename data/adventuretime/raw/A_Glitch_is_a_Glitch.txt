Jake: Ha-ha-ha. Okay, now make him look angrier!
Finn: Alright, give me a second.
Jake: Nope, not funny anymore. Sorry, dude—you ruined it.
Finn: Man, I don't have patience for this animation junk. Whoever does this must have no life whatsoev—
Finn: Oof... Why did I do that?
Jake: Yo Finn, did you order a brick?
Finn: Hm, I don't think so.
Jake:  False alarm; it's just an email.
Finn: Who's it from?
Jake: Looks like Ice King's handwriting.
Finn and Jake: Eeeww!
Finn: Escape, Jake! Escape!
Jake: Alright, alright, hold on.  Oh man! Thing must've had a computer worm in it!
Finn: Whaa? Aaaah!
Ice King: Hey, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum: What now, Ice King?
Ice King: Remember that time last summer when you said you'd only go out on a date with me if I was the last guy on Land of Ooo:Ooo?
Princess Bubblegum: I doubt I said that.
Finn and Jake: P-bubs! P-bubs, P-bubs!
Finn: The computer went...
Jake: Open video and...
Finn: The email...
Jake: Potato trampoline...
Finn: Brick window with the plastic...
Jake: Then crashment!
Finn: Banana hummingbird...
Jake: 47 grapes!
Ice King:  Anyone having any...  computer problems? 
Finn: How do we stop the computer worm, you pile of goo?!
Ice King: E-ha-ha-ha-ha! My worm exists beyond your comprehension within the universal source code...
Finn: STOP TALKING LIKE A NERD AND GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT!!!
Ice King: Once the glitch does its work, the whole world will be deleted! Except for me and my "Bubblygums."  Ow!! Well, see y'all! I'm gonna prepare for my... date. Ahaha! 
Donut Guy:  AAAAAHH! MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!! MY HOPES AND DREAMS—RUINED!!! 
Finn: Don't worry, Princess, we'll take care of this thing.
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, me too.  I'm gonna take care of it, too. 
Finn: Okay! 
Finn:  Don't worry, guy! I got you!  YEOW! JAKE, HELP ME!!!
Jake:  Okay, shh, you're safe!'' [Chocoberry's arms and legs fell apart then disappeared.'']
Finn: Come here, guy!
Sugar Cube: No... Stay away from me!
Finn: I'm trying to help you, yo!
Sugar Cube: I saw what happened when you picked up Mr. Cupcake:Todd. 
Finn: But... No!! Jake, this isn't working! We need a plan.
Jake: Aw, man. Okay, here is my dream plan. You were wearin' tights made of green feathers. These tiny green feathers. And I was this wisecracking coelacanth that only ate popcorn. Anyway, we were in this—
Finn: THAT PLAN'S NOT GOOD!
Jake: Hold on, I'm almost done. So we were trapped inside this huge egg, and after a while you started dancing in this kind of sign language. And then Ice King's glitchy stuff started eatin' my dream up. I peed in my pants, but you went up and talked to it. You just... talked to it.
Finn: Then talk to it I will.  Hey man, tell me the haps.
Jake: Yeah, tell us your feelings! Get deep.
Jake: "Sllabfoog uoy pleh tnac I..."
Donut Guy:  OH, SWEET LORD, MY FACE! MY PERFECT...!!
Jake: Slaw frog yokel snacky. Snacky slaw frog yokel. Sea salt yack let a snacky. Yeah, that sounds good!
Donut Guy: AAAAAAAAAAH...!!!
Finn:  Jake, I think I found a way in!
Jake: No, wait, dude. I think I cracked the code!
Finn: There's no time! 
Jake: AAAAAAH!!!
Finn: AAAAH... AAH!!!
Jake: This must be the universal source code!
Finn: Huh? Ice King and Bubblegum?
Finn: Jake! Don't touch anything!
Jake: Huh?
Finn: I think the shiny things are the building blocks of the universe, man! They store every single thing that is a thing back on thing!
Jake: Okay, enough exploring already. Where is this The Glitch:glitch guy? I'm gonna smash his jimmies. 
Finn: Jake, what is it?
Ice King: Oh, Princess Bubblegum? Guess who? Can you guess? Can you? I'll give you 3 chances.
Princess Bubblegum: No.
Ice King: OK, four chances. 
Princess Bubblegum:  Ice King, give me the anti-virus, or I'll shoot you with my candy horse tranquilizer!
Ice King: But sugar, look what I brought you! A box of chocos!  Hm... Still good.  Argh. Look, I can't prove it, but...  ...you made a promise we'd have at least one date if...  ...if I was the last person on Ooo...'' [Ice King is shot several times in the face.''] You promised... 
Princess Bubblegum: Okay, well, even if I did promised, you're not the last person on Ooo, because ''I'm'' still here. 
Ice King: Well, uh... Ooh, I-I have a hand too, y'know? I can lend you one...  Check out my cool hand! 
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, that's disgusting.
Ice King: Grrrr!!!
Finn: Come on, Jake, pull it together, man.
Finn: Jake?
Jake: Oh, no, my arm!  We had so many great times together...
Jake: Dooby, dooby, dooby, dooby, skeebily, skeebily, dapdy doo...
Jake: Huh? Who's that?  Awww.
Jake:  Let's do this... for Righty!
Finn: That's the spirit!  ADVENTURE TI--!!!  Oh, my gams!! Hold up, dude, my body's changing! 
Princess Bubblegum:  ...No. 
Ice King: Oh, come on, woman, I'm trying to be nice! Can't you at least make the best out of this?  Are you praying to me? I'm into this.  ...I'm still into this.  Still into it.
Princess Bubblegum:  GIVE ME THE ANTI-VIRUS!
Ice King: I can't, monkey peeps, I didn't make one! The glitch will delete everything until we're all that's last!
Princess Bubblegum: You mean, forever?!
Ice King: Well, yeah! I mean, you say that like it's a ''bad'' thing.
Princess Bubblegum: Come on, Finn and Jake....
Jake: So, hey, Finn, how do you plan on taking this guy out?
Finn: 
Jake: Okay, I guess it's worth trying.
Jake: Aah! What we do now?
Finn: We gotta get those things... outta his stomach.
Jake: Hey, Finn! Remember that gross video Ice King sent?
Finn:  Ugh, yeah.  Yeah!!
Jake: Let's double team these locks! 
Finn and Jake: We did it! 
Jake: You should wash your hair!
Finn: You should wash your mouth! 
Ice King: Huh? No way! Impossible!  Uh...
Jake: Everything back to normal, huh? 
Finn: Seems like it. 
Donut Guy:  Aah! My face!! My beautiful face is back to normal!!! Aaah!!!! 
Finn: Hey, have you seen the princess anywhere?

Jake: Yeah, no big deal. Geez... 
Princess Bubblegum's hand: I missed you!
Jake's elbow: I missed you, too!  Whoa, you taste different, baby! You been playin' basketball in someone else's hockey rink?
Finn: Ahem... Hey, Bubs, where's the Ice King? I wanna kick his boingloings! 
Jake: Yeah. Where is he? I wanna kick his boingloings, too!
Ice King: Uh... guys? Hello? Princess. Uh... Let's forget all about this...  Ugh get off of me, you creep! Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!
