{{L|[''The episode begins at [[Iceberg Lake]] where [[Finn]] is lighting a flamethrower with a [[Flambits|flambit]]'']}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah! [''Laughs and torches an iceberg''] Yeah!}}
{{L|[''The iceberg melts, exposing several objects inside'']}}
{{L|Finn| I found another bike and more computers. What do you got?}}
{{L|Jake| I keep finding baby shoes!}}
{{L|[''Jake torches an iceberg with his flamethrower and exposes more baby shoes'']}}
{{L|[[Jake]]| WHAT THE HECK, MAN?! And they're all lefties! Sorry I'm not finding any loot.}}
{{L|Finn| Keep it together, chubby, because I think we found enough scrap to finish building our gauntlet dock; a dock that is also a gauntlet.}}
{{L|Jake| Aww. Building this gauntlet dock is hard, man. Hard work sucks.}}
{{L|Finn| Don't be lazy, Jake.}}
{{L|[''There's a bubbling noise coming from the lake behind Finn and Jake'']}}
{{L|Finn| Huh?}}
{{L|Jake| Incoming iceberg!}}
{{L|Finn| Whoa! That one's huge!}}
{{L|Jake| I got dibs! Ooo. I hope it's not baby shoes.}}
{{L|[''Jake wipes the surface of the ice, which reveals a face within the ice'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Gasps''] It's a guy.}}
{{L|Finn| Creepy. It's a buncha guys.}}
{{L|Jake| You know what they remind me of? Well-dressed pickles.}}
{{L|Finn| Stand back, Jake! I'm gonna melt 'em outta there! Full charge.}}
{{L|[''Finn blasts a huge flame out of his flamethrower and Jake runs up to stop him'']}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa, don't roast 'em, man. You gotta flamb√©.}}
{{L|[''Jake gently brushes the flame across the iceberg and it soon melts'']}}
{{L|Jake| Ah. Perfecto. Bon appetit.}}
{{L|Finn| Hey! Can you hear me? Hello?}}
{{L|Jake| [''Knocking on one of their heads''] I don't think they made it.}}
{{L|Finn| Hey. [''Reaching for a briefcase''] This one's got some kind of pack.}}
{{L|[''One of them comes to life and pushes Finn away; Finn screams'']}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| I remember... business.}}
{{L|Finn| Let go! Let go! Let go!}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman|We... are [[Business Men]].}}
{{L|Finn| Oooh... Well, I'm Finn and he's Jake.}}
{{L|Jake| What kind of business do you do?}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Been frozen... so long, I... [''The businessmen all shake their heads, as if in pain''] can't remember. Can't remember! Oh. Looking for help, your business? We love work for you.}}
{{L|Finn| Nah. Adventurers don't need any help.}}
{{L|Jake| Yes! Help us fix that dock.}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Dock-ka?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah! Right over there.}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Yes. This dock-ka... could be more... efficient.}}
{{L|Finn| No! Wait!}}
{{L|[''The businessmen reel back and murmur as if frightened'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, this dock is our fun pie. We should be the ones to bake it.}}
{{L|Jake| But they're begging for it, Finn. Just look at 'em.}}
{{L|[''The businessmen look excited and several of them are drooling'']}}
{{L|Businessmen| [''Murmuring''] Build dock. Build dock.}}
{{L|Jake| Finn. These poor souls are lost without jobs. We can't ignore their plight.}}
{{L|Finn| Uhh...}}
{{L|Jake| [''To the businessmen''] Go on guys, fix it up!}}
{{L|Businessmen| Woo!}}
{{L|[''The businessmen murmur excitedly as they run over to the dock and begin building'']}}
{{L|Finn| Well... they do seem really happy to do it.}}
{{L|Jake| Of course, man. They said they "love work for you."}}
{{L|Businessmen| [''In unison''] Uhh... We finish.}}
{{L|[''The camera zooms out to show a completed gauntlet dock'']}}
{{L|Finn| Whoa!}}
{{L|Jake| Told ya so.}}
{{L|Finn| Come on! Let's try it out!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake run through the gauntlet dock, avoiding the traps and obstacles, while Finn screams excitedly'']}}
{{L|[''At the end of the dock, Finn and Jake jump into the water'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Laughing''] Yeah! Woo!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Laughing''] Yeah! Woo! [''Panting''] See? If we hire them full time, they'll be back in business and we'll be able to focus on fun stuff. Everybody wins!}}
{{L|Finn| Maybe you're right.}}
{{L|Jake| [''To the businessmen''] You hear that, guys? Maybe I'm right!}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Really? Job? With... ad-ven-tur-ers?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, mans!}}
{{L|[''The businessmen cheer and dance'']}}
{{L|[''The red-tie businessman throws down his briefcase and chisels "Fin [''sic''] & Jake Adventuring Incorporated" into the side'']}}
{{L|[''The scene changes to the Tree Fort where the businessmen are cleaning weapons, ironing socks and shining shoes'']}}
{{L|[''Jake is playing a video game on BMO'']}}
{{L|Finn| Feels weird doing nothing.}}
{{L|Jake| Relax, man. This is your day off.}}
{{L|[[Hot Dog Princess]]|[''From far in the distance''] Help! Somebody help!}}
{{L|Finn| Trouble, dude! Get your axe! I'll get my... wha?}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Adventure pack... ready for you.}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, thanks man.}}
{{L|[''The scene changes to Finn and Jake running across the Grass Lands, weapons in hand'']}}
{{L|Finn| I have to say, Jake. My sword is totally shiny and stinkin' sharp!}}
{{L|Jake| Uh huh.}}
{{L|Finn| Even my shoes feel different. Not only are they clean, I feel radder, faster, more... adequate.}}
{{L|Jake| Cool!}}
{{L|[''The businessmen are running behind Finn and Jake, writing notes'']}}
{{L|[''A battle cube is chasing Hot Dog Princess'']}}
{{L|Hot Dog Princess| Help!}}
{{L|Finn| Don't cry, Hot Dog Princess! Jake and I will fend off these battle cubes!}}
{{L|[''The businessmen sit off to the side and continue to take notes while eating donuts and drinking coffee'']}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake begin to fight the battle cubes, which are flying around Hot Dog Princess' kingdom'']}}
{{L|[''The scene fades to a later time, where everyone is tired from fighting and Hot Dog Princess is taking a nap'']}}
{{L|Finn| Man. I'm getting tired.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Groan''] Me too. These cubes are... frickin' resilient. Hey, business dudes! Hold off these cubes so we can catch our breath?}}
{{L|Finn| Jake! They don't know how to fight.}}
{{L|[''The businessmen run over, wearing armor and wielding weapons; they begin fighting the battle cubes while Finn and Jake rest'']}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| [''Offering bottled water and orange slices''] Water. Orange slices. Help rehydrate.}}
{{L|[''Red-tie businessman runs back into battle, shouting'']}}
{{L|Jake| These guys are great, right?}}
{{L|Finn| I gotta admit... they are helping. [''Surprised''] Oh! I think I figured out how to defeat the battle cubes!}}
{{L|Jake| That's 'cause you had time to rest your body and refresh your brain.}}
{{L|Finn| [''To businessmen''] Ok! We'll take it from here, guys!}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah! Good work.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake run towards the battle cubes; Jake roars and grows large'']}}
{{L|Finn| Grab all the cubes together!}}
{{L|[''Jake stretches his hands to become giant and clasps them together, grabbing all the cubes'']}}
{{L|Jake| Got 'em!}}
{{L|[''Finn grunts and jumps into Jake's hands with a rope and ties all the battle cubes together into a single, large cube'']}}
{{L|Finn| It worked!}}
{{L|[''Jake throws the cubes off into the distances'']}}
{{L|Finn| Wake up, Hot Dog Princess. You're free.}}
{{L|Hot Dog Princess| Oh! Thank you, Finn and Jake! Especially you, Finn.}}
{{L|[''Hot Dog Princess stands on her hind legs and puckers her lips, as if to give Finn a kiss'']}}
{{L|[''Finn rears back, disgusted'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Whispering to Jake''] Ugh. She smells like old hot dog water.}}
{{L|[''Jake giggles and the red-tie businessman runs in between Finn and Hot Dog Princess to take the kiss instead'']}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| [''Whispering to Finn''] I take one for team.}}
{{L|Finn| This is awesome! You get a promotion, fella.}}
{{L|[''Red-tie businessman cheers and dances'']}}
{{L|businessman| Take one for team, too.}}
{{L|[''The other businessmen begin kissing Hot Dog Princess'']}}
{{L|[''The scene changes to the Tree Fort where Finn and Jake are playing BMO'']}}
{{L|Jake| Oh... Lost again!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Grabbing the controller''] My turn.}}
{{L|[''Jake walks over to the businessmen, operating a large collection of wires and monitors'']}}
{{L|Jake| What's that?}}
{{L|[''Jake goes to the freezer and takes out a tub of ice cream'']}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Hero vision monitor. Use satellite to tell us world problems.}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, wow. Anything going on?}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Just small things. You save stress for big thing.}}
{{L|Jake| Freakin' awesome, man.}}
{{L|Finn| What are they doing?}}
{{L|Jake| Takin' care of business.}}
{{L|[''Jake eats a scoop of ice cream and Finn plays the video game'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, hit me!}}
{{L|[''Jake flings a scoop of ice cream into Finn's mouth'']}}
{{L|[''Time passes, showing more and more empty ice cream tubs stacked near Finn and Jake while both of them are getting fatter and fatter'']}}
{{L|Video game| Mission complete.}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake get up and dance around, shaking their enormous guts'']}}

{{L|Jake| Woo! Yes!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake both get tired and stop celebrating to take a breath'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''Tired''] Ooo.}}

{{L|Jake| Yeah. [''pushing around Finn's gut''] You're gut's so huge and moldable.}}
{{L|Finn| Hey!}}
{{L|Jake| Hold on a sec!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Laughs''] Man, that tickles.}}
{{L|[''Jake manipulates Finn's gut to look like the Ice King'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Impersonating Ice King's voice''] I'm the Ice King, and I'll never find a bride because I'm such a tool.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Laughs''] Alright, let me try.}}
{{L|[''Finn manipulates his gut to look like Princess Bubblegum'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Impersonating Princess Bubblegum's voice''] I'm Princess Bubblegum and I'm a dork, because I like science! I've also got a really annoying voice that Finn thinks is attractive!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Laughs''] That's a- Hey, what'd you say?}}
{{L|[[Lumpy Space Princess]]|[''On a hero vision monitor, running from a [[Swamp Giant]]''] Ahh! Oh, my gosh! Leave me alone. All I said was "you're ugly," which is totally true. Somebody help me! Oh no!}}
{{L|Jake| Man, I am not in the mood for saving Lumpy Space Princess.}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, business dudes!}}
{{L|[''The businessmen enter the room from various directions'']}}
{{L|Finn| What do you guys think?}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Hmm... Just one monster. We do.}}
{{L|[''The businessmen run off'']}}
{{L|Jake| Right. We'll just save our strength for the big adventures, then.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake sit back down on their couch and relax'']}}
{{L|Jake| Ahh. Nice call, dude.}}
{{L|Finn| Imagine how awesome the adventure's going to be when it's time for us to go out there.}}
{{L|Jake| I'm too tired to imagine stuff, but I bet you're right.}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''Both grabbing a tub of ice cream and toasting with them''] To being great adventurers!}}
{{L|[''They both begin eating ice cream; time passes and shows that they have empty tubs and ice cream all over their faces. They are even fatter, and Finn's gut is now visible outside his shirt'']}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake both groan and waiver until they fall over'']}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, gosh.}}

{{L|Jake| businessmen, dude.}}
{{L|A voice in the distance| Heeeeeelp!}}
{{L|[''Finn walks over to the window and gasps, seeing the businessmen in a large robot, sucking up [[Fuzzy Friends]] into a container'']}}

{{L|Finn| Jake! We messed up! The businessmen have gone bat-crazy, dude!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Still lying on the floor''] Man, just let the businessmen handle it.}}
{{L|Finn| THE BUSINESSMEN ARE THE PROBLEM, you lazy plug-hole!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Opens his eyes, surprised''] Huh?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Yelling out the window''] Guys!}}
{{L|[''Finn begins to climb out the window and down to the bottom of the Tree Fort'']}}
{{L|Finn| Guys, stop it!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Running up to the businessmen's robot''] Stop it, guys!}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Stop what, boss?}}
{{L|Finn| You're jacking up those Fuzzy Friends!}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| But... We're being heroes. Like you, boss. We're protecting them. Collecting them in our care-sack so they cannot be hurt. It's the most efficient way to save people.}}
{{L|Finn| But you're making them unhappy!}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Irrelevant! These people are in our care-sack. Their happiness is not priority.}}
{{L|Finn| I am your boss! And you guys are all fired!}}
{{L|[''The businessmen begin to murmur to each other'']}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Fi-red?}}
{{L|[''The businessmen shout angrily and start sucking up the Fuzzy Friends even faster than before'']}}
{{L|[''They move their robot and it crushes one of the Fuzzy Friends'']}}
{{L|Finn| Nooo! Alright, guys. Now I've gotta take you down... Finn style.}}
{{L|[''Finn runs over to kick their robot, and gets sucked up into the care-sack'']}}
{{L|Finn| I'm kicking your care-sack, dudes!}}
{{L|Jake| Finn? Whoa... Crud.}}
{{L|[''Jake squeezes his enormous gut out the window'']}}
{{L|Jake| I'm comin' buddy!}}
{{L|[''Jake flops onto the ground, still holding a tub of ice cream'']}}
{{L|Jake| Ahh. I'm so fat, dude; I don't know what to do.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Gasp''] That's it! Jake! Demoralize them!}}
{{L|Jake| What? Why?}}
{{L|Finn| Do it, man! I have a legit plan!}}
{{L|Jake| Ok, Alright. [''To businessmen''] Hey! You guys are horrible at business!}}
{{L|[''The businessmen lash about angrily and try to suck Jake up into their care-sack, but he's too fat to fit'']}}
{{L|Jake| Huh? They're sucking me up, dude!}}
{{L|Finn| Now, eat that ice cream some more to become fatter, while also using your Stretchy Powers to grow huge!}}
{{L|[''Jake chows down on the ice cream and starts getting bigger'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''lifting his head up for a second''] Ok!}}
{{L|[''Jake uses his Stretchy Powers as he gets pulled into the robot'']}}
{{L|Jake| This sucks.}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, dude! Keep growin'! You're breaking apart their robot!}}
{{L|[''The robot begins to shake violently, the businessmen scream'']}}
{{L|Jake| Oh no!}}
{{L|[''The robot explodes and Finn, Jake and the businessmen go flying into the air'']}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| [''Attempting to grab Finn''] I'm going to kill you, not-boss!}}
{{L|Finn| Wait, man! Wait! I wanna re-hire you guys!}}
{{L|Red-tie businessman| Re-hire? Really?}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, mans.}}
{{L|Businessmen| Woo hoo!}}
{{L|[''As they all fall back to the ground, the businessmen and Finn grasp hands and form a five-point star'']}}
{{L|[''The scene changes to a beach, where Finn, Jake and the Fuzzy Friends are waving towards the water'']}}
{{L|Fuzzy Friends| Yay! Hip-hip hooray! Pancakes!}}
{{L|[''The businessmen are once again frozen in an iceberg and float back out to the middle of the lake'']}}
{{L|Jake| So, wait... What'd you hire them to do?}}
{{L|Finn| I hired them to stuff themselves in that iceberg and get outta here.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Sigh''] I'm gonna miss 'em. And I'm gonna miss this gut.}}
{{L|[''Jake uses his Stretchy Powers to return to his normal size'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Laughs''] I'm gonna miss my gut too.}}
{{L|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''Finn strains and attempts to suck in his gut like Jake, but it doesn't disappear''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}
{{L|Finn| Huh? Aww...}}
{{L|<nowiki>[</nowiki>''The episode ends with a stark close-up of Finn's frowning face with "The End" on it''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}
