{{L|[''[[Finn]] and [[Jake]] are sleeping in the [[Tree Fort]]'s boat.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''snoring'']}}
{{L|[''A fly flies into his mouth.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Ah. [''smacks lips'']}}
{{L|[''The fly escapes and buzzes down to [[BMO]] and [[Neptr]], who are playing by the well.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Stand and deliver, boy, because I'm Robbing Hood. Give me all your funny money, Sheriff of Naughty-hams.}}
{{L|Neptr|But BMO, I don't want to be the bad guy. I want to be Robbing Hood's pal, Friar Tux.}}
{{L|BMO|No, Neptr. [''uncaps marker and draws a mustache on Neptr's face''] Ha ha! Friar Tux would never have a mustache like that. [''laughs'']}}
{{L|Neptr|No fair. En guard!}}
{{L|BMO|On Blitzen!}}
{{L|[''They hit their sticks together repeatedly. Neptr swings his stick at BMO, but BMO jumps and dodges it.'']}}
{{L|BMO|You're terrible!}}
{{L|[''Neptr swings again, but BMO ducks.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Whoa!}}
{{L|[''The stick hits the wall of the tree fort, which starts rumbling. The wall suddenly cracks, and out bursts a deluge of coins.'']}}
{{L|BMO|Eeeee!}}
{{L|Neptr|Aaaaa!}}
{{L|Jake|[''wakes up''] What? Hey! What are you kids doing breaking the treehouse?}}
{{L|BMO|Uh...}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake climb down from the boat.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Yo, BMO, what happened?}}
{{L|BMO|You got too much money, honey. All of this dosh is threatening the structural integrity of the treehouse.}}
{{L|Finn|Who would have thought we could have too much treasure?}}
{{L|[''Something groans behind them, under the treasure. The [[Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant]] emerges.'']}}
{{L|Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant|I'm sorry, master.}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!}}
{{L|Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant|You told me to stay inside the money room, but now I am outside. What is your punishment, master?}}
{{L|Finn|No punishment, dude. Just chill where you are.}}
{{L|Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant|All right. I will chill where I am until you command me.}}
{{L|Finn|So what should we do with all this swash?}}
{{L|BMO|You should give it to Robbing Hood.}}
{{L|Jake|No way, BMO. This is our treasure.}}
{{L|BMO|Aw.}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, maybe we could, like, spend it?}}
{{L|Jake|Really? How much of it?}}
{{L|Finn|Dude, like all of it. Then we can find completely new treasure.}}
{{L|Neptr|Neptr knows just the place to blow your grease. Behold, this recent advertisement. [''hands flyer to Finn'']}}
{{L|Jake|Whoa! We get mail?}}
{{L|Finn|Check it out, Jake.}}
{{L|[''The flyer reads: Come to [[Wildberry Kingdom]], a really expensive vacation destination.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Dang! Wildberry Kingdom got all fancy.}}
{{L|[''Jake lifts up the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant, gathers together all the treasure, transforms into a legged dump truck, and sets the elephant back down. Finn climbs in, and the two start leaving.'']}}
{{L|Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant|I continue to chill.}}
{{L|BMO|[''following Finn and Jake''] Come on, Naughty-Hams.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake arrive at the Wildberry Kingdom, passing a gondola, a roadside meat stand, and restaurants. A waiter serves two [[Wildberry People]] a plate of meat.'']}}
{{L|Patron|Thank you.}}
{{L|[''The waiter takes the patrons' stacks of money.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Nice place. So how are we gonna spend all this gish?}}
{{L|Jake|I don't know. I've never really spent money before. I've only stolen it or hoarded it.}}
{{L|Finn|Ha!}}
{{L|Jake|[''laughs''] [''sighs''] So... here we are in the middle of town.}}
{{L|[''Jake dumps the load of treasure in a fountain.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Let's parse out some dough to spend.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake climb in to the fountain.'']}}
{{L|[[Strawberry Guard]]|Hey! What are you doing? No people or money allowed in the fountain, ya dums! Where's your sense at?!}}
{{L|Jake|Sorry, man. We were just looking to spend some cash in town. [''offers three coins''] Want some?}}
{{L|Strawberry Guard|Fellas, goofing in a public fountain is punishable by a lashing, ''and'' you're trying to bribe me.}}
{{L|[''Jake offers a crown.'']}}
{{L|Strawberry Guard|Ooh! Now that's what I'm talking about, fellas. [''takes crown and coins and starts to leave''] [''laughs''] Have a good time in the fountain.}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|[''laugh'']}}
{{L|Jake|Whoa. Spending money is kind of fun.}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, this'll be easy. [''stands up''] Ho, ho, young berry lads!}}
{{L|Wildberry kid|Yeah?}}
{{L|Finn|Go buy the most expensive meats and furniture to adorn our new fountain home. Keep the change for your families in need. Hyup! [''throws a bag of money to them'']}}
{{L|Wildberry kid|Thanks, but we're, uh, middle-class.}}
{{L|Finn|Really?}}
{{L|Wildberry kid|Uh, yeah, upper middle.}}
{{L|Jake|Just get the darn furniture.}}
{{L|Strawberry Guard|Hey, no furniture or meat in the fountain! You'll wreck up the water!}}
{{L|[''Jake offers some more treasure.'']}}
{{L|Strawberry Guard|You can't buy me off twice, fellas.}}
{{L|[''Jake offers still more treasure.'']}}
{{L|Strawberry Guard|[''laughs''] Ah, maybe you can, fellas, maybe you can. [''runs off'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''laughs maniacally'']}}
{{L|Finn|Dude, we bought all this furniture and meat, and we still have a ton of gamboni left.}}
{{L|Jake|Hmm. [''gasps''] Look at those gams! Hey, yo, Legs! Legs! You want a bag of money?}}
{{L|Legs|Sure!}}
{{L|Jake|Well, what are you gonna do for it?}}
{{L|Legs|Well, um, I'm a dancer by trade.}}
{{L|Jake|Show me. [''tosses him a moneybag'']}}
{{L|[''Legs does a sequence of ballet moves.'']}}
{{L|Legs|Hup!}}
{{L|Jake|[''laughs''] Finn, look. I made this guy dance.}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, man. Whoo!}}
{{L|Strawberry Guard|Hold it! No dancing in the streets without a permit!}}
{{L|Jake|Go away, dude.}}
{{L|Strawberry Guard|Hey, you can't talk to me like that.}}
{{L|[''Jake tosses him four moneybags.'']}}
{{L|Strawberry Guard|All right, I'm going!}}
{{L|Jake|[''laughs raucously''] This is crazy. People do anything for money. And I've got a ton of money. Dance harder, Legs! Harder!}}
{{L|[''Jake throws coins at Legs as he dances.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''laughs''] [''sighs''] This bores me. You're boring! It's time to push this thing further. Middle-class berries, watch after this treasure while I'm gone. [''throws them coins'']}}
{{L|Wildberry kids|Okay.}}
{{L|[''The scene changes to a house in the Wildberry Kingdom, where two Wildberry People are sleeping.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Ahem.}}
{{L|Goji Berry Man|Mabel, do you hear something?}}
{{L|[''Mabel turns on the light, revealing Finn and Jake, who is covered in moneybags like a Wildberry Person.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Good evening.}}
{{L|Wildberry People|Oh no! We're being robbed!}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, no, we're not robbers. We're actually here to ''give'' you money.}}
{{L|Goji Berry Man|What?}}
{{L|Jake|Listen. I want to see you two do things [''places a bag on the bed''] for this bag of money.}}
{{L|Goji Berry Man|Okay, man.}}
{{L|Jake|[''laughs''] Yeah, nice. Goji Berry Man, you sleep on the left side of the bed normally. Now you sleep on the right!}}
{{L|Goji Berry Man|Okay.}}
{{L|[''He switches places with Mabel.'']}}
{{L|Mabel|I don't like sleeping on your side. It's too close to the wall!}}
{{L|Jake|Mr. Goji Berry, you sleep on your back now—and on top of the covers.}}
{{L|Goji Berry Man|I can't sleep on my back, man. I got sleep apnea. I won't get any sleep. My wife won't get any sleep. My dance instructing will suffer.}}
{{L|Jake|Turning down all this smoosh, huh? Dance instruction pays more than I thought. [''starts walking off'']}}
{{L|Goji Berry Man|Wait, man! There's got to be something else we can do to get those gold coins.}}
{{L|Jake|Well, sure, man. As a matter of fact, you can have all the gold coins... all the gold coins you can eat!}}
{{L|Wildberry People|[''gasp'']}}
{{L|Jake|Dinner is served! [''dumps a moneybag on each of their plates''] Yummy, yummy, yummy. Hey, you kids need some desert? I'll just see what I can rustle up—in the toolshed! [''laughs loudly''] [''walks off'']}}
{{L|Finn|Guys, I'm super sorry about my friend. Here. [''gives them two moneybags'']}}
{{L|[''The Wildberry People start munching the bags.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Don't eat it, ya dums!}}
{{L|[''The scene cuts to outside the house, where Jake is coming back from the toolshed with a wheelbarrow of various indigestible items.'']}}
{{L|Jake|How much do you think I'd have to pay them to lick the dust off all this dusty stuff?}}
{{L|Finn|Dude, I do not approve of the way you're spending money right now.}}
{{L|Jake|Dude, they're not doing anything they don't want to. They want my sweet cheddar, and I want to see some stuff in exchange. It's mutual—free market.}}
{{L|Finn|What?}}
{{L|Jake|Free market! [''wheels the barrow to the house'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''to himself''] Don't worry, brother. I'll help you see the error of your ways.}}
{{L|[''Back in the Wildberry Kingdom, the Wildberry kids are standing on the pile of loot. Finn runs up to them.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Berry lads! Berry lads! I need to spend all this blingo fast.}}
{{L|Wildberry kid|Okay.}}
{{L|Finn|Take me to the seediest alley in the kingdom.}}
{{L|Wildberry kid|That's Crudberry Back Alley... in Crud Town.}}
{{L|[''In Crudberry Back Alley, some homeless Wildberry People are sleeping on the ground. Finn and the Wildberry kids arrive with a wheelbarrow of treasure.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Friendly Crudberries, I have money for you! Come get it!}}
{{L|Hobos|Money? Money!}}
{{L|Finn|Easy, fellas! Let's pass these out one at a time.}}
{{L|[''A hobo tries to take one of Finn's bags.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, take it easy, breh.}}
{{L|Hobo|Give us that money! [''punches Finn'']}}
{{L|Finn|I-I-I don't want any trouble. [''punches a hobo''] I'm trying to help you.}}
{{L|[''They continue fighting each other in the alley. Finn then runs out with his face covered in juice.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''sits''] Whew! [''pants'']}}
{{L|[''One of the hobos peaks around the corner, but Finn punches him with his eyes closed.'']}}
{{L|Jake|How much coin would it take for you to be my berry foot warmer?}}
{{L|Finn|Dude!}}
{{L|Jake|Oh, hey, man.}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, this money is bad. We got to get rid of all of it right now.}}
{{L|Jake|Okay, I got a plan. And this time, it's gonna involve ''all'' the money.}}
{{L|[''The song "[[Money]]" plays as Finn and Jake bribe their way past several guards and the elevator operator to [[Wildberry Princess]], who is sleeping in a tub of meat in a "decompressing" room.'']}}
{{L|[''Jake throws moneybags at the door.'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|[''yawns'']}}
{{L|[''Jake continues throwing the bags and breaks down the door.'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|Finn and Jake?}}
{{L|Jake|Princess, are you ready to earn all this cay-ash?}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|What...?}}
{{L|Jake|All of this sweet, sweet crunkle is yours if you let me... [''holds up a tiny stool''] sit on your head.}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|[''yelling''] Get out of here!}}
{{L|Jake|[''scoffs''] No one can say no to this much dinero. ♪M-m-money♪}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|Jake, I am warning you.}}
{{L|[''Jake shrinks down and sits on Wildberry Princess' head.'']}}
{{L|Jake|♪M-m-money♪}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|[''growls'']}}
{{L|Jake|♪M-m-money♪}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|Aah! Guards! Guards! Seize Finn and Jake and prepare them for execution!}}
{{L|Jake|Or don't do that and get paid mad bucks.}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|And take all their money!}}
{{L|Jake|Take all my money?!}}
{{L|[''The scene cuts to Finn and Jake hanging by their wrists on a stage.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Well, we were trying to get rid of all that skrilla anyway, right?}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|Finn and Jake, yes, you have insulted me, but worse than that, you have abused the power of money!}}
{{L|Crowd|[''gasps'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|We will deal with you swiftly and ironically by encasing you in your own molten gold!}}
{{L|[''Above Finn and Jake, a Wildberry Person stirs a gigantic pot of liquid gold.'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|Release the golden flood!}}
{{L|[''A Wildberry Person turns a crank, which releases the flow of gold.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''gasps'']}}
{{L|[''Just before the gold pours on to Finn and Jake, an arrow hits the chute and pushes it over the Strawberry Guard.'']}}
{{L|Strawberry Guard|Oh, no! Aah!}}
{{L|[''Gold encases the Strawberry Guard. The crowd disperses, screaming.'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|Who dares?}}
{{L|BMO|Ho, ho, ho! Robbing Hood is the defender of the poor!}}
{{L|[''A Jelly Horse gallops up, with Neptr tied to its side.'']}}
{{L|Neptr|Me too!}}
{{L|Jake|Good shot, BMO!}}
{{L|BMO|I was aiming for the rope. [''shoots an arrow''] Yeah!}}
{{L|[''The arrow hits Jake in the armpit. Jake pulls it out and cuts Finn and Jake's ropes with it.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Let's bounce, po' boy.}}
{{L|[''They all get on the Jelly Horse and ride away.'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess|Finn and Jake, if you ever return to Wildberry Kingdom again, I'll have you double-dipped in gold! Unless I get a written apology.}}
{{L|[''Outside the Tree Fort, Finn spots a coin.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Huh? Gold piece. You want to flip to see who writes that apology letter?}}
{{L|Jake|How about you write it, I sign it.}}
{{L|Finn|[''laughs''] No way, man.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake enter the now-empty treasure room. Finn flips the coin, which rolls across the floor and down a hole.'']}}
