{{L|[''The episode begins in the [[Ice Kingdom]].'']}}
{{L|[[Ice King|'''Ice King''']]: [''Off-screen''] Okay, [[Gunter]]! You ready for the show to begin?!}}
{{L|Gunter| Wenk! [''Sips drink'']}}
{{L|Ice King| One, two, three... [''He comes out, revealing he's wearing a [[Marceline]] wig.''] [''Singing''] Gunter! [''Sings the [[Fry_Song#Ice_King's_"Gunter"_version|Gunter version of the Fry song]]''] [''Gunter stares lovingly at Ice King.''] [''Speaking''] It's rhetorical, Gunter. Marceline's songs are so good! Mmm... Maybe I can get Marceline to write a song ''with'' me! [''The penguin pulls off Ice King's wig.''] Man, if she helped me write a song like that, I'd be crushin' it nonstop with the princesses! Ooh, yeah! [''The Ice King notices that the penguin is chewing on the wig.''] Heh! Gunter, you cute little dummy. You know, Gunter, my song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in. Hmm.}}
{{L|[''Walks to a bookshelf and pulls out a book'']}}
{{L|Ice King| [[Jay T. Doggzone]] always says, "Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts." And I've got a [[Ice King#Origin|''way'' tortured past]]! ...I think. I don't really... re... [''Unsure''] Hmm. [''Flies up and grabs the penguin''] Quickly, Gunter! To the "The Past" room!}}
{{L|[''Carrying the penguin, he flies down to the depths of his lair and arrives in a room full of various items.''] Ah, yes. [''He opens a drawer and takes out his scrapbook.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| Lot of emotional, powerful stuff in here. [''Sniffs it''] Still wet with tears... I'll take some-a' these for lyrical inspiration. [''Throws scrapbook on pile of junk''] So where's Marceline ''living'' these days?}}
{{L|Penguin| Wenk.}}
{{L|Ice King| A [[Marceline's cave|''cave'']]?? [''Blows a small raspberry'']}}
{{L|[''Ice King flies out of his lair, carrying the penguin, an Omnichord, and a drumset. He's being viewed through binoculars.'']}}
{{L|[[Finn]]| [''Viewing Ice King''] Well, well, well. Looks like the Ice King is up to bad biscuits, brotha.}}
{{L|[[Jake]]| Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro.}}
{{L|Finn| Ice King, you make our job too easy. You ready to roll on this fool?}}
{{L|Jake| ''Dinner'' roll!}}
{{L|[''Scene transition to Marceline's cave. Marceline is strumming her [[ax bass]]. She notices Ice King coming in the cave through her window.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| Hello? Anybody home?}}
{{L|Marceline| [''To herself''] No... [''She goes outside her [[Marceline's house|house]].''] What are you ''doing'' here? I told you ''not'' to come around me!}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Laughs''] Uh, yeah, I know, but... I was hoping you could help me write a song—one that could help me get some princess action.}}
{{L|Marceline| I'm not gonna help you [[wikipedia:profanity|pick up on chicks!]]}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Desperate''] Come on! We could be a prog rock duo! I'll even split the fans with you. I get the princesses, and you get... whatever it is you're into. Sounds good, yeah, I think it does! [''Beat; Marceline is scowling.''] Ee-yoop!}}
{{L|[''He laughs as he flies into her house. Marceline waves Gunter goodbye and follows Ice King. Gunter looks down in disappointment and walks away.'']}}
{{L|Marceline| [''Landing on porch; to Ice King''] Hey!!}}
{{L|Ice King| Eh...}}
{{L|Marceline| Get ''outta'' here!!}}
{{L|Ice King| Wait! Just let me play you what I've written so far! [''He unties his equipment and it falls to the ground.''] [''To himself''] Oh. Dang it. Tangles in the cord. Sometimes this happens when you fly with it... Tangles are hard... [''He grunts as he tries to untangle it. Marceline just stares.''] Oh. Aw, aw, geez, no... Oh, no. [''He lays on the ground, trapped in the tangled cord.''] Ice King's in trouble. [''She looks at him awkwardly.''] [''Grunts''] [''To Marceline''] Hey, you know what? I'll just hum it for ya. [''Hums a tune''] Is that good?}}
{{L|[''The door opens.'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Ice King!}}
{{L|Finn| ...Wha?}}
{{L|Jake| Oh... You got 'im.}}
{{L|Finn| Nice job, Marceline.}}
{{L|[''Jake walks up to Ice King.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Talking like [[Wikipedia:Batman|Batman]]''] Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me sick.}}
{{L|[''Jake picks up Ice King. He and Finn start to walk off with him.'']}}
{{L|Marceline| No, he can stay.}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Wha?!}}
{{L|Ice King| Yeah, "Wha?!"}}
{{L|Marceline| It's alright. We're working on a song together. [''She takes Ice King.'']}}
{{L|Finn| You don't want us to... [''Connects palm with fist''] ...for you?}}
{{L|Marceline| No, it's okay. You guys can go.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake begin to exit, confused.'']}}
{{L|Finn| ...Okay... Well... I guess we'll see ya, then...}}
{{L|[''They look around awkwardly.'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Bye... [''They exit.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| [''To Marceline''] You know, I kinda like bein' tied up in these cords. Kinda ''freak-aaaayyy''!}}
{{L|[''She immediately drops him.'']}}
{{L|[''Scene transition. Marceline plugs in and turns on the Omnichord.'']}}
{{L|Marceline| So what kinda song're we playing?}}
{{L|Ice King| Ooh. I brought these [''the scrapbook pages''] for some inspiration. Just use these to work off of. Y'know, a template.}}
{{L|[''She grabs a page. It's drenched in tears.'']}}
{{L|Marceline| Oookaaaay...}}
{{L|[''She plays the Omnichord.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| Yeah. Yeah, that's good! Keep doin' that! [''Ice King snaps to the music.''] [''Singing''] [[Slime Princess]], you're alright. [[Flame Princess]], you're okay. [[Wildberry Princess]] could be better. All of the [[Princess (disambiguation)|princesses]] are pretty alright, but... Oh, [[Princess Bubblegum|Bubblegum]]! You look like a lot of fun! I'm right outside, and that is how I know! Hey, princess, did you get my text with a picture of my awesome gun show? I'm also workin' on my pecs! If you like, I'll send a picture of that, too! Oh, Bubblegum! [''Marceline looks uncomfortable.''] I really need someone. [''She sadly looks down.''] Or anyone! [''Saddening''] ...Pretty much anyone. I'm so alone! [''Activating [[Ice Powers|ice magic]]''] Won't somebody tell me what's wrong with me?! [''Shooting frozen lightning bolts''] Anybody! [''Tearing up''] Anybody! [''Marceline turns at the sound of his distress.''] [''Speaking''] Anybody!!! [''Practically sobbing''] [[Grob Gob Glob Grod|Grod]] in the sky, please tell me why!!!}}
{{L|Marceline| Stop acting like this!!}}
{{L|Ice King| No, it's just startin' to get good!! [''Shooting ice beams everywhere, singing''] Anybody!! [''Speaking''] Princesses, I command you, ''love'' me!! Love me!! Love me!! [''Crying''] Love me!!}}
{{L|[''She forces him to the ground.'']}}
{{L|Marceline| [''Direct''] STOP ACTING CRAZY.}}
{{L|Ice King| I JUST WANNA BE LOVED!! [''Pushes her off forcefully''] Uh-oh. I'm sorry I pushed you. [''He goes to the kitchen and plants his head against the refrigerator in sadness.''] Uh... oh... I'll just stay out of your way. [''Climbs on refrigerator''] Again, I'm sorry I pushed you.}}
{{L|[''Marceline walks to the refrigerator and sighs. She then opens it and takes out an apple. Ice King's beard lightly rubs her head.'']}}
{{L|Marceline| Huh?}}
{{L|Ice King| Whatcha got? An apple?}}
{{L|Marceline| [''Frustrated''] Ugh! [''She drops the apple and just drops down, sitting in front of the fridge. She rolls the apple away; the apple reaches the Omnichord and turns it on.''] [''Singing''] You're so annoying, you ''pitiful'' old man. I'd like to help you, but I don't know if I can. I thought you were nuts, but you're ''really really really'' nuts. [''Beat''] Every time I move, eventually, you find me, and start hanging around. Just another lame excuse to see me. ''Man''. It's getting me ''down''. You know, I'm actually glad... to see you! [''Speaking''] Maybe ''I'm'' the one who's... [''Sighing''] nuts.}}
{{L|[''The Omnichord switches off.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| Hold on! [''Drops from fridge''] Do you... ''like'' me?!}}
{{L|Marceline| ...Of ''course'' I do, you old jerk!}}
{{L|Ice King| Really? ...Wow. [''Wipes dirt off sleeve''] How about... [''Spreading arms out''] one of these? [''Marceline's scowl fades. She consents and hugs him, visibly bittersweet about it.''] Ah! [''They pull back and look at each other in the eyes. He puckers his lips.''] Mwah, mwah, mwah...}}
{{L|Marceline| [''Disgusted''] AAAAAGH!!! ''Not'' like ''that''!! You don't remember anything, ''do'' you... SIMON?}}
{{L|Ice King| What-mon?}}
{{L|Marceline| Why do you even come ''see'' me when you don't ''remember'' me?! You don't even know who ''you'' are!}}
{{L|Ice King| Yes, I do! I am a lyricist! [''Pulling pages out''] It's all here! On the page! The page in song, baby! On this receipt! On this takeout menu! On these newspapers! [''Laughs'']}}
{{L|[''Marceline stares, devastated. A photo lands in her hands.'']}}
{{L|Marceline| Huh? Look! This clipping! This was ''you'', Simon! ''Before'' the [[Mushroom War|War]]!}}
{{L|[''The picture portrays a human Ice King walking out of a car ready to deliver [[The Enchiridion (book)|the Enchiridion]] to a museum.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| Huh? [''He can't make heads or tails of it.''] Heh?}}
{{L|[''Marceline hurries to look for something else. She finds a picture of herself as a child and gasps.'']}}
{{L|Marceline| This! ''You'' took this ''picture''! Grr, you've scribbled all over it... Huh? [''She reads the back of the photo, visibly in great shock.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| Ooh, ooh, are they good lyrics? [''Grabbing Omnichord''] I'll get the keyboard!}}
{{L|Marceline| What? [''In desperation''] Wait, listen!}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Sets Omnichord up''] Yeah, let's go! What's it say? Sing out, sister!}}
{{L|[''Marceline reads the message again, then stares at Ice King, not sure what to do.'']}}
{{L|Marceline| [''Singing and reading note''] "Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world? That must be so confusing for a little girl. And I know you're going to need me here with you... but I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're going to lose me, too..."}}
{{L|Ice King| Ooh, yeah! Keep it going! [''Goes to drumset'']}}
{{L|Marceline| [''Looking for another photo''] Oh! Um... [''Singing and reading note''] "This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me [''Pulling hair back, stressed out''] crazy, and I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please forgive me for whatever I do [''Marceline shrinks in devastation''] ...when I don't remember you."}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Happy''] Wow! I wrote that?! Hot stuff!}}
{{L|Marceline| What?! You don't remember what it ''means''?! [''She grabs another photo and shows it to him. She tears up as her voice breaks.''] Look!}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Reads note while singing''] "Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away. I can't remember what it made me say... but I remember that I saw you frown. I swear, it ''wasn't'' me. It was the [[Ice King's crown|crown]]. [''He frowns and looks confused, but then ignores it.''] This magic keeps me—"}}
{{L|Ice King & Marceline| [''Singing together''] "—alive, but it's making me crazy, [''Marceline begins shedding tears.''] and I want to save you, but who's going to save me?! Please forgive me for..."}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake are still in the cave. Finn is looking in the house with his binoculars.'']}}
{{L|Jake| What is goin' ''on'' in there?!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Takes binoculars off''] ...I have no idea.}}
{{L|Ice King & Marceline| [''Singing together''] "...Please forgive me for whatever I do... when I don't remember you."}}
{{L|[''As the music continues [and Ice King and Marceline sing, "Da da... da da... da da..."], the scene flashes back to just after the apocalypse. It looks dismal and there are ruined buildings everywhere. A child Marceline cries. Simon Petrikov returns to her and wipes her tears in recompense for leaving her alone. He walks to a ruined store and grabs a [[Hambo|teddy bear]]. He goes back and gives the toy to Marceline to make further amends, and she smiles sweetly. The episode ends.'']}}
