{{L|Finn & Jake|[''Pant while swimming in a circle'']}}
{{L|Jake|Faster, we're getting a swirl!}}
{{L|[''Both look at small swirl and fist-bump.'']}}
{{L|Jake|You ready to get out?}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, dude.}}
{{L|Jake|Let's get BMO to make us some sassages. Maybe with that one mustard? [''[[Sassage Flare]] comes down Jake's leg''] I'll use the Sassage Flare.}}
{{L|[''Jake shoots the Sassage Flare towards the sky which spells "Sassage" in green letters'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hopefully [[BMO]] sees that.}}
{{L|Finn|Didn't [[Lady Rainicorn|Lady]] tell you not to use the Sassage Flare?}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah.}}
{{L|Finn|Well, don't abuse it man. 'Cause you're gettin'...}}
{{L|Jake|I'm gettin' what?}}
{{L|Finn|'Cause you're gettin' fat.}}
{{L|[''Finn's hat glows and comes to life'']}}
{{L|Finn|Wah! [''throws hat''] Whoa...}}
{{L|[''Finn's hat starts chasing Finn'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''stops hat with foot''] Hey. Relax.}}
{{L|Jake|Grob, dude! You're hat's alive! [''pets Finn's hat and laughs''] This is crazy! [''pets Finn's hat some more''] He likes me!}}
{{L|[''Finn's hat looks at Jake's head.'']}}
{{L|Finn|It's not my hat. It's, like, this other thing now.}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, man, hats can be anything: pants, other people. It's fine!}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, but it's like, ''living'' now.}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, it's a miracle. Now he can listen to our rad jokes and hang out.}}
{{L|[''pause'']}}
{{L|Finn|Right. Maybe it's good he's alive. [''kneels down to hat''] You ''were'' a rad hat, and now you're a rad...little dude.}}

{{L|BMO|Oh, what? Ahh! There's hot grease next to us; don't fool around!}}
{{L|[''BMO tries to remove Little Dude by hitting it with a spatula and then falls off the stool'']}}
{{L|BMO|Oh no! Get off of me!}}

{{L|BMO|I am fine, Finn. I just thought you kept better company.}}
{{L|Finn|Sorry, BMO, he's just excited.}}
{{L|[''Finn carries the struggling Little Dude to the table and sits down with him'']}}
{{L|Finn|Sorry, Little Dude, but I have to eat. [''Finn puts a fruit bowl on top of Little Dude to restrain him'']}}
{{L|BMO|Don't touch anything! I'm still frying up garnish!}}
{{L|Finn|Okay.}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, okay. [''takes some milk, pours it into a bowl, and he and Finn both dip a sassage in the milk, and then they both eat theirs'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''feeling Finn's hair''] Your head looks weird with short hair man, heh, heh, it feels like a peach.}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, Little Dude, y'all can get in on this if you promise to be good. [''mouth full''] Only good babies get sassages.}}
{{L|Little Dude|[''knocks the fruit bowl off his back''] Nyang!}}
{{L|[''Little Dude opens his mouth and walks through the sassages, which come out the other side untouched.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, don't eat the—the food?}}
{{L|Finn|[''picks up a sassage and sniffs it''] [''retches''] Dude, he turned it into poo! This is poo now—smell it!}}
{{L|Jake|[''sniffs twice''] Yep.}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|Little Dude!}}
{{L|Jake|[''trying to grab Little Dude''] Quit it! [''grabs him''] Gotcha!}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, little Deezy. What am I gonna do with you?}}
{{L|BMO|You guys should get ready for bed.}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, okay.}}
{{L|[''As Finn walks by, BMO spanks Finn.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Oh!}}
{{L|Jake|BMO hit ya on the butt. [''laughs'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to the outside, where Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving is making his way toward the Tree Fort.'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts back to Finn and Jake, who are in their room putting on their pajamas.'']}}
{{L|Little Dude|[''reaching for Finn's head''] Nyang! Nyang!}}
{{L|Finn|Shhhh. Little Dude, you gotta chill. [''blows out candle''] Night-night. [''gets into bed with Little Dude'']}}
{{L|Little Dude|Nyang. Nyang. [''Finn holds him down''] Nyang.}}
{{L|[''Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving crawls past the window on the outside.'']}}
{{L|Little Dude|[''fearfully''] Nyang.}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, wake up. Someone's on the house!}}
{{L|Jake|Tsk, it's probably [[Ice King]] again, dude. Man, we should tell him we know he sleeps on the top of our house. [''glass shatters offscreen''] Oh.}}
{{L|[''Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving, breathing raggedly, reaches through the broken window and turns the knob to the front door, letting himself in.'']}}
{{L|Little Dude|He-ah-ha. [''licks Finn's hands'']}}
{{L|Finn|Ugh. [''Little Dude escapes his grip''] No, no, no!}}
{{L|[''Little Dude crawls up Finn's back to the top of his head and starts to squat on it.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''gasps''] No, not on my head! Poo buns! Poo buns on my head! WAAAAAH!}}
{{L|Little Dude|N-Nyang.}}
{{L|Jake|[''picks up Little Dude''] Gross.}}
{{L|[''Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving starts climbing the ladder to where Finn and Jake are.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''gasps''] [''stretches Little Dude back to Finn's bed'']}}
{{L|[''Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving gets onto the floor, but Finn and Jake are nowhere to be found.'']}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|[''breathes raggedly'']}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake are shown on the ceiling above him. Finn lets go.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''in midair''] Ninja.}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|Eh?}}
{{L|[''Finn lands on Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving and Jake (shaped like a sumo wrestler) does the same.'']}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|[''in pain''] Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!}}
{{L|Finn|What are you doing in our house, homey?}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|Please don't hurt me! You're in grave danger and it's all my fault!}}
{{L|Finn|Wha? What are you talking about?}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|Your hat accidentally touched my head flower. See? [''touches a floorboard, bringing it to life''] My magic imbues anything it touches with an evil spirit, one that craves destruction and chaos. Yech. [''turns the floorboard back to normal''] I buried myself so that nothing would touch my body ever again, but then this bloom grew out of my head. C'est la vie!}}
{{L|Finn|Evil magic donks, homey.}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|I'm sorry, that's just the way my magic works. [''takes out a locket with pictures of his parents in it''] [[Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving's father|Papa]] always said I was a bad wizard. Right, Papa?! "Baby's a bad wizard." A bad wizard, huh?! You're a bad wizard! [''tosses locket aside''] I'm a bad wizard! [''cries'']}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa, cool it, man. Let's just fix Little Dude.}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|[''sniffs''] Okay.}}
{{L|BMO|Guys! Your stanky friend jumped out the window and ran toward the [[Candy Kingdom]]!}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to the Candy Kingdom, where a [[Candy People|Candy Person]] is walking and whistling. He comes into a dark alley and sees Little Dude.'']}}
{{L|Cream Puff Gentleman|Oh, hello. Aren't you a cutie! Hey, are you lost, tiny gentleman?}}
{{L|Little Dude|Nyang! [''jumps on the Candy Person's head'']}}
{{L|Cream Puff Gentleman|[''muffled screams'']}}
{{L|[''The Candy Person transforms into a muscular guy with glowing green eyes.'']}}
{{L|Cream Puff Gentleman|Nyang, nyang! Nyang, nyang!}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Finn, Jake, and Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving running into the Candy Kingdom.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''panting''] Where is he?!}}
{{L|Finn|[''calling''] Little Dude! Little Dude!}}
{{L|Cream Puff Gentleman|[''running out of alley''] Nyaaaaaaang! [''comes up to a horse in front of a saloon''] [''The horse blows a raspberry at him''] Nyang? [''punches the horse, knocking it over'']}}
{{L|Candy Sheriff|[''comes out of saloon''] [''imitates guns cocking'']}}
{{L|Little Dude|Nyang. [''rips a streetlight out of the ground and prepares to throw it at the sheriff'']}}
{{L|Candy Sheriff|Blisterin' beef!}}
{{L|[''Cream Puff Gentleman throws it at him, knocking him into a building across the street. Cream Puff Gentleman then rams the building, causing it to crumble.'']}}

{{L|Cream Puff Gentleman|[''laughing''] Nyang, nyang, nyang... [''continues'']}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake run toward him and jump on him.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Little Dude! You were supposed to be my buddy!}}
{{L|[''Cream Puff Gentleman punches Finn, sending him sliding across the ground toward a cart of oranges. Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving emerges from under the oranges.'']}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|All my fault. All my fault!}}
{{L|Jake|[''straining as he tries to take Little Dude off of Cream Puff Gentleman'']}}
{{L|[''Cream Puff Gentleman throws Jake off of him toward Finn and Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving.'']}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|Oh, gleeble snoots!}}
{{L|Finn|How is he so strong?}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|Whomever the hat possesses gains the proportional strength of a hat! [''horse neighs''] Look out! He's got the horse again!}}
{{L|[''Cream Puff Gentleman throws the horse at the building behind them. The horse blasts its way through the other side and hits one of the [[Gumball Guardian]]s'']}}
{{L|Gumball Guardian|Evil presence detected!}}
{{L|[[Banana Guard]]|[''imitating a siren''] Wee-oo-wee—[''a garbage can hits him and knocks him on his back'']}}
{{L|[''Cream Puff Gentleman continues punching Jake while stepping on Finn. Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving is cowering nearby.'']}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|Sorry, fellas. I don't thrive in conflict situations!}}
{{L|[''Cream Puff Gentleman starts stretching Jake.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Ow.}}
{{L|[''The Gumball Guardian arrives.'']}}
{{L|Gumball Guardian|[''points at Cream Puff Gentleman''] Evil.}}
{{L|Cream Puff Gentleman|Nyang? [''sees Gumball Guardian's head''] [''quietly''] Nyang.}}
{{L|[''Little Dude hops off of Cream Puff Gentleman and starts climbing the Gumball Guardian.'']}}
{{L|Finn|No! Not the Gumball Guardian!}}
{{L|Gumball Guardian|Evil.}}
{{L|Little Dude|[''stretches over the tip of the Gumball Guardian's head''] Nya-hang!}}
{{L|[''The Gumball Guardian's eyes are now glowing green.'']}}
{{L|Gumball Guardian|Na-yang! [''blows fire through its mouth'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''to Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving''] Dude, use your powers!}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|I can't! All I ''can'' do is think about my papa and how much I disappoint him!}}
{{L|[''The Gumball Guardian shoots a type of laser at a different area of the Candy Kingdom, causing a huge explosion.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Just think of something positive! Something comforting!}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|Like... my mommy? When I came home with bad grades from wizard school, my mommy used to hug me, and hug me, [''babbles like a baby''] Ooh, Mommy! [''giggles'']}}
{{L|Jake|Uh, yeah. Just think about your mom and use your magic.}}
{{L|Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|O-Okay, let's try this. [''touches a tree and closes his eyes''] I... love my mommy?}}
