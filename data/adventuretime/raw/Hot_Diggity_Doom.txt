{{L|[''hammering'']}}
{{L|[[Peppermint Butler]]|[''Sighs'']}}
{{L|Mr. X|[''Heavy breathing'']}}
{{L|[''Cage rattling'']}}
{{L|[[Squirrel (The Duke)|Squirrel]]|[''Grunting''] Raaaah! Raaah! Come on! Get ready, toids! Raaah! I'm mean as a bus, and I'm mad as rocks!}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Gumball guardians! There's an enemy at the gates!}}
{{L|Squirrel|I'm an all-you-can-eat maniac! Whoops! Aw, come on! Ooh, ooh, ooh!}}
{{L|Candy Person|Whoopee!}}
{{L|[''Crowd cheering'']}}
{{L|[''Crowd murmuring'']}}
{{L|[[King of Ooo]]|Thank you, little candies. Thank you. You warm the wax heart of this poor king of Ooo! Now, I hear you asking, "King of Ooo, how can you be so wise?" I'll tell you how. Did you know that I am 8000 years old? Could be.}}
{{L|[''Crowd cheering'']}}
{{L|King of Ooo|It's true. I'm that wonderful.}}
{{L|[''Lens clicks'']}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Now, [[Princess Bubblegum]] — she ''says'' she hasn't gone rogue. She ''says'' she's not a wild dog thirsty for blood. She ''says she's not a literal baby'' masquerading as an adult woman. She says a lot of things. Princess Bubblegum, you don't make sense!}}
{{L|[''Crowd cheering'']}}
{{L|[[Jake]]|This guy's really working on me.}}
{{L|[[Finn]]|Ennnh...}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Yes, dear? Do you have something to say?}}
{{L|[[James' Mom|Mrs. James]]|Mm-hmm. I'm James' mother, Mrs. James. My son got turned into a mutant mass and was exiled to the badlands by Princess Bubblegum.}}
{{L|[''Crowd boos'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Trehh! Boo.}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Who ''isn't'' mad about their mutant children?}}
{{L|Candy dude|What about [[The Lich (character)|Sweet P]], King of Ooo? You threatened to burn down [[Tree Trunks (character)|his mama]]'s orchard.}}
{{L|King of Ooo|I did. That is true. Sweet P, I was like a cornered animal. "I knew no' what thy doone." I'm sorry, Sweet P. Here. Psst — give me a kiss.}}
{{L|[''Smooches'']}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Do you hear us, Princess Bubblegum? Do you hear us?!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Shhhhhhhhut up.}}
{{L|[''Door opens'']}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Princess, I'm sorry to disturb you, but I feel that you must campaign. The candy people are real dumb.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|I'm studying something that could be real important. Dah! This dumb election. It's not even — [''yawning''] I mean, it's barely even — [''yawns''] ...barely even legal.}}
{{L|King of Ooo|A barely and yet fully legal election — that's what my campaign manager told me. Let's hear it for him — Mr. X! [''Laughs''] Weird, right?}}
{{L|[''Crowd cheering'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|And even being legal, I mean, I ''made'' everyone. I made their homes. The candy people are mercurial, but they're not dillweeds.}}
{{L|King of Ooo|And this definitely legal election is in the jam-covered fingers of you, the people — the candies. [''Grunts''] So, go. Vote with your hearts. Vote with your minds. Vote for the candidate who's ''not'' a teenage gum-golem.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|I mean, they know that I love them.}}
{{L|[[Starchy]]|And the votes are in. King of Ooo is our new princess.}}
{{L|[''All cheering'']}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Hey, hey!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|What?!}}
{{L|[''Rapid footsteps'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Whaaaaat?! You dillweeds! You're a dillweed, you're a dillweed's secretary, and you're probably some dillweed I've never met! You're three dillweeds being dillweeds, and you're going to dillweed this place into the ground! And ''you —'' [''growls'']}}
{{L|Finn|Princess! Princess! I don't know what a dillweed is.}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, PB, what's the plan? We pledged our allegiance to ''you.''}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Your allegiance is to the kingdom. [''Sighs''] Dudes, I don't know. I don't know when I'll be back in charge — ''if'' I'll be back in charge. I need you both to stick around here and make sure the candy people are safe, even if it means working for a wad. Auf wiedersehen, meine champions. Mwah. Mwah.}}
{{L|[''Bells ringing'']}}
{{L|[''Crowd cheering'']}}
{{L|King of Ooo|There's a new golden and waxy mornin'. Good times a-comin'. You've got your warning. There's cheap healthcare, the workcamp's there. The general tone is laissez-faire. I'm a princess, I'm a princess. I'm a priiiinceeeess.}}
{{L|[''pop'']}}
{{L|[''Peppermint Butler grunting'']}}
{{L|[''Lock rattling'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|What's up, Peps?}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|It's stuck.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|[''Grunts''] [''Strains'']}}
{{L|[''Clatter'']}}
{{L|[''Wood clattering'']}}
{{L|[''Bats screeching'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Ho, no, no, no, no! It's okay, everyone. It's okay. Close your eyes and repeat your safety mantra — hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie —}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Princess?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Huh? Oh. Sorry, peps. I'm just so used to having my citizens around to protect. This is gonna take some getting used to.}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|Permission to speak freely, ma'am?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Granted.}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler|This horrible dump does not meet the level of fancy to which I have become accustomed.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Noted. Also, FYI — my Uncle Gumbald built this cabin with his bare hands. I spent my summers here when I was younger. Anyway, it'll probably take a ''really'' long time for the candy people to realize a bad ruler is worse than a good ruler. Plenty of time to spruce this place up.}}
{{L|Starchy|Whew! Starchy thought life would be better under the King of Ooo, but now there's even more stuff to sweep. [''Sighs''] Poor old Starchy. Always getting the sweaty end of the lollipop.}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, Starchy. What are you doing — sweeping?}}
{{L|Starchy|Oh, uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Suh-wee-ee-eepin'. Yeah.}}
{{L|Jake|Mm. Hey, is it me, or is getting purpler out here?}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, yeah. I think that's the catalyst comet. Guess it's getting pretty close or whatever.}}
{{L|Jake|Getting close? Should we evacuate or...}}
{{L|Finn|What? No, no. It's cool, I think. It's just here to, like, shake things up, you know?It's okay. We've got sort of a — a relationship.}}
{{L|Starchy|C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-comet?! Oh, Starchy don't feel good about this.}}
{{L|Jake|Starch?}}
{{L|Finn|Eht.}}
{{L|Starchy's mind is burdened. Oh, Mrs. gumdrop! He's coming. The comet — it's gonna snuff out all life as we know it.}}
{{L|Mrs. gumdrop|What?! Oh, good Glob!}}
{{L|Jake|Shouldn't we try and calm them down?}}
{{L|Finn|Ehh, not after that whole knock-my-tower-over-onto-the-castle thing. A lot of guys got smooshed. They need to hear it from someone they really trust.}}
{{L|Finn|King of Ooo!}}
{{L|Jake|King of Ooo!}}
{{L|Finn|King of Ooo?}}
{{L|Jake|King of Ooo?}}
{{L|Finn|King of Ooo?}}
{{L|Jake|Wait, are you saying "King of Ooo"?}}
{{L|Finn|What are you saying?}}
{{L|Jake|I thought it was "kinkoff goo."}}
{{L|[''Tapping'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hey. You hear that?}}
{{L|[''Tapping continues'']}}
{{L|Finn|Downstairs. King of Ooo? King of Ooo?}}
{{L|Jake|King of Ooo!}}
{{L|[''Tapping continues'']}}
{{L|[''Ratcheting'']}}
{{L|Jake|What the —}}
{{L|Finn|It's that guy from before. He's mucking around with PB's ship — added all kinds of engines to it.}}
{{L|Jake|Hey!}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, what do you think you're doing? PB don't let ''nobody'' touch her stuff — not even me, and I'm cool — least of all you, you sauce-tasting Brian-sniffer — whoa!}}
{{L|Jake|[''Gasps'']}}
{{L|Finn|Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yeeh! Yeeh! Whoa! Uhhh! [''Weakly''] No mercy, Jake.}}
{{L|Jake|[''Straining''] [''Chuckles''] Aaaaah!}}
{{L|Finn|Hey, I'm back — [''Gasps''] What the bing bong ping pong?! Gunther?!}}
{{L|[''Chirps'']}}
{{L|Finn|What the king Kong sing song?! Whoaaaa — oof!}}
{{L|Gunter|Sayonara, suckers! [''Laughs evilly'']}}
{{L|[''Crowd screaming'']}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Uhh...}}
{{L|Banana Guard|[''Grunts'']}}
{{L|Banana Guard|[''Grunts'']}}
{{L|Candy person|Ugh!}}
{{L|Starchy|Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Oww!}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Aaaaah!}}
{{L|Toronto|[''Munching'']}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Toronto, I've been princess for four hours, and society has already totally collapsed. Plus, now the sky is falling, I guess. Is this possibly... Somehow my fault?}}
{{L|Toronto|Pbbt! No way! Okay, look. Without your calming presence and selfless leadership, this situation would have been a hundred times worse. History will remember you as Ooo's greatest hero.}}
{{L|King of Ooo|As always, the voice of reason. Once again, my saintly nature has compelled me, unthinking, to assume the burdens of others. But a true justice demands a true accounting. And truly this is all Bubblegum's fa-aa-aa-ault!}}
{{L|[''Rumbling'']}}
{{L|King of Ooo|Oof! Good glob! What no-o-o-o-o-w?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Looking good, Peps. Man, this feels kind of good, right? It's like we're building a whole new kingdom from scratch, only without all my beloved citizens this time... and their dull, pleading chicken eyes. Maybe the King of Ooo ''could'' hold down the fort for a little while. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? Anyway, I'm gonna get some fresh air. B.R.B. What the — why's it so purple outsi—}}
