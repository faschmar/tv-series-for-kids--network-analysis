{{L|[[Patrick McHale|Pat McHale]]| In the dark recesses of the mind, a disease known as FEAR feasts upon the souls of those who cannot overcome its power...}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake chase a Fire Newt to the ocean'']}}
{{L|[[Finn]]| Come back, thief!}}
{{L|[''The [[Fire Newt]] spews fire at Finn and [[Jake]]'']}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa!}}
{{L|Fire Newt| Stop farting on me! It's gross!}}
{{L|Finn| You can't just go around stealing boots.}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, and you know the penalty for stealing boots. It's poots... on newts.}}
{{L|Both| [''Laugh'']}}
{{L|[''The Fire Newt wades into the ocean to avoid Finn and Jake'']}}
{{L|Finn| He's getting away in that lake!}}
{{L|Jake| Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean.}}
{{L|[''Jake stretches and heads towards the ocean, a poot following behind, barking'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Laughs and runs after Jake''] Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! ...Huh?}}
{{L|[''The hue of the ocean and sky changes to red and ominous music plays as a wave crashes'']}}
{{L|[''Finn backs away from the water as it washes onto land'']}}
{{L|Finn| Uhh...}}
{{L|Jake| [''Laughing and farting on the Newt''] Poots on newts! Poots on newts!}}
{{L|Fire Newt| No!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Slow-motion''] Poots on newts!}}
{{L|Finn| [''laughs and starts removing his shoes''] I'm coming, Jake. I'll poot on that newt as soon as I'm barefoot. Uh...}}
{{L|[''The ocean turns a red hue again and ominous music plays as a wave crashes'']}}
{{L|[''Finn gasps and rapidly crawls away from the water'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Breaths heavily, his stomach rumbles''] Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts?}}
{{L|[''A black smoke rises out of Finn's navel'']}}
{{L|Finn| Ow!}}
{{L|[''The smoke forms into a face and laughs'']}}
{{L|Finn| Wh-wh-wh-Who are you?}}
{{L|[[Fear Feaster]]| I am the manifestation of your fear... fear of the ocean!}}
{{L|Finn| What? I'm not afraid of lakes, wells, or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles. Why would I be afraid of- [''Screams and backs away from the water'']}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| [''Laughs''] 'Cause you're a wuss.}}
{{L|Finn| I'm no wuss! I'm the hero around these parts!}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| Ha! You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero.}}
{{L|Finn| Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'!}}
{{L|[''Finn charges towards the ocean, screaming, but stops when he sees a wave crash'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Shakes his head and takes a deep breath''] I shall conquer my fear.}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| Yeah, right.}}
{{L|Finn| No! I will. I'll conquer my fear.}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| Of course you will, [''Receding back into Finn's navel''] and I live in a two bedroom apartment that doesn't smell like vomit [''Laughs''] ...Sarcasm.}} [''Jake comes onscreen, panting, and shrinks back to normal when he reaches Finn]'' 
{{L|Jake| Dude. Dude, did you see me? I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this! Womp! Womp! And then... Hey, what’s wrong with you, dude?}}
{{L|Finn| Jake. I think I'm afraid... of the ocean.}}
{{L|Jake| Say what, now?}}
{{L|Finn| I need your help to overcome my fear. Will you do it?}}
{{L|Jake| Um... No... I don't really wanna do it.}}
{{L|Finn| Jake! Come on!}}
{{L|Jake| I'm just messing with you. I'll do it. Hmm... Where to start? Oh, ok. I think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Jake's hand if you're scared.}}
{{L|[''Jake grabs Finn's hand and starts walking towards the water, but Finn doesn't walk and falls over'']}}
{{L|Jake| Um... Oh it's ok, dude. I see the problem. It's just your feet.}}
{{L|[''Jake walks over to Finn's feet and takes his shoes off'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Manually moving Finn's feet forward one at a time''] Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop.}}
{{L|Finn| Don't be scared. I shall not be scared.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Still moving Finn's feet''] Boop. Boop.}}
{{L|[''The water touches Finn's feet'']}}
{{L|Finn| I'm afraid! Ah! [''Jumps on top of Jake and starts punching him''] Jake, get me out of the water! Now, Jake! Now! Now!}}
{{L|[''Jake inflates his head and walks Finn back to shore'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hot jam! You're really scared of the ocean. In fact, you're so scared... it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean!}}
{{L|Finn| Jake!}}
{{L|Jake| Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning.}}
{{L|Finn| But I must conquer this now! [''Runs towards the ocean screaming''] I'm not afraid of you!}}
{{L|[''Multiple waves crash directly in front of Finn in rapid succession and a single droplet hits Finn's face'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''reels back in slow-motion and screams'']| NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Running backwards''] I'm afraid of you! I'm afraid of you! [''Screams'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Exhaustedly crawls to Jake's feet''] Ok, yeah. Let's try tomorrow.}}
{{L|[''The scene changes to Finn and Jake's bedroom where Jake is sitting on top of a sleeping Finn'']}}
{{L|Jake| Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Opens his eyes''] Morning, Jake.}}
{{L|Jake| Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear?}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, man.}}
{{L|Jake| Cool... but I can only do this if you ask me.}}
{{L|Finn| I'm askin'!}}
{{L|Jake| Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one!}}
{{L|[''Jake punches the bedroom wall and the entire structure breaks apart, leaving Finn and Jake floating on Finn's bed in the middle of the ocean'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Screams''] Jake, are you crazy? This is not an OK thing to do!}}
{{L|Jake| Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends.}}
{{L|Finn| You're nuts. [''Wriggles from side to side'']}}
{{L|Jake| Don't try to struggle, man. [''Pulls the blankets back, revealing that Finn is tied to the bed''] I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down.}}
{{L|Finn| Really? Ok. I'm calming down.}}
{{L|Jake| That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Breathing heavily''] Yeah, man. I can do it.}}
{{L|Jake| Alright, dude. Step... two! [''Unties the rope'']}}
{{L|[''The bed collapses and falls into the ocean, leaving Finn floating inside his sleeping bag and Jake on top of him'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Screams''] Jake, this isn't a joke! It's touching me!}}
{{L|Jake| Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Heart pounding''] I'm trying to let it hold me.}}
{{L|Jake| Control your breathing!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Breathes in and out''] This isn't working!}}
{{L|Jake| That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream.}}
{{L|Finn| W-what?}}
{{L|Jake| I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream.}}
{{L|[''Jake pushes Finn's head underwater'']}}
{{L|Finn| What?!}}
{{L|Jake| Don't scream. Hold your breath, Finn. You got it, dude!}}
{{L|[''Finn screams and bursts out of his sleeping bag, sending Jake flying into the water'']}}
{{L|[''Finn jumps onto Jake's head and starts pounding on him'']}}
{{L|Finn| Get me away, Jake! Now, Jake! Now! Right now! Get-Get me away! [''Screams'']}}
{{L|Jake| Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow!}}
{{L|[''Finn grabs Jake's ears and stretches them until they catch wind and carry both Finn and Jake to an island of pre-war ruins'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Laughs''] I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do?}}
{{L|Jake| I think we should give up.}}
{{L|Finn| What? I made it all the way to level three.}}
{{L|Jake| Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean this [''Pointing to his face''] is my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude.}}
{{L|Finn| You have to help me. I can't do this without you.}}
{{L|Jake| Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore.}}
{{L|Finn| I swear I won't hit you anymore.}}
{{L|Jake| And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times.}}
{{L|Finn| I swear... and pigs have hair.}}
{{L|Jake| Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four.}}
{{L|Finn| What? I thought you said it was a three step plan... man.}}
{{L|Jake| I'm not that good at counting. [''Laughs and grabs a small, rusty submarine''] Come on. Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine... in the sea cucumber.}}
{{L|[''The scene changes to underwater where Finn and Jake are heading to the ocean floor in the submarine'']}}
{{L|Jake| Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Eyes closed, breathes heavily and shivers''] Yeah. It's pretty math... you psychopath.}}
{{L|Jake| You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Opens his eyes''] Whoa...}}
{{L|Jake| See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful.}}
{{L|Finn| Hey. This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Points''] Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut.}}
{{L|Finn| No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!}}
{{L|[''Finn sees the Fear Feaster's face appear in front of the abyss'']}}
{{L|Finn| Noooo!}}
{{L|Jake| Saying, "Turn around" twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude.}}
{{L|[''Finn pushes Jake away from the submarine controls'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hey, you swore!}}
{{L|[''Finn pummels Jake'']}}
{{L|Jake| Ow! My bread and butter!}}
{{L|[''Finn grabs the controls and jerks them violently'']}}
{{L|Jake| No, dude! Don't!}}
{{L|[''The submarine moves wildly and launches torpedoes, one of which hits a building'']}}
{{L|[''The building topples and hits the submarine, causing it to start filling up with water'']}}
{{L|Jake| Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five. [''Handing Finn a dive suit''] Here, put this on.}}
{{L|[''Finn starts putting on the suit'']}}
{{L|Jake| Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab.}}
{{L|[''Finn pulls the emergency tab'']}}
{{L|Jake| No, dude! I said don't...}}
{{L|[''Finn's suit expands rapidly and knocks Jake back, hitting his head against a valve and knocking him out'']}}
{{L|[''Finn floats to the surface and watches Jake descend into the abyss along with the broken submarine'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake? Jaaaaaake!}}
{{L|[''Finn reaches the surface and jumps onto a buoy'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake!}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| [''Laughs''] Pathetic! You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die! Your un-heroic body will never let you save Jake. [''Laughs'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Sadly''] You're right.}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| What? Really? You think I'm right? Well, that's... that's great!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Holding a wrench''] If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do.}}
{{L|[''Finn removes his helmet, hits himself on the head with the wrench and falls into the ocean'']}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| No. Wait. No! Noooo!}}
{{L|[''Finn lands on the ocean floor and wakes up next to Jake'']}}
{{L|[''Jake groans'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake! Jake! Wake up!}}
{{L|[''Jake opens his eyes'']}}
{{L|Finn| You ok, dude?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear!}}
{{L|Finn| What?}}
{{L|Jake| You're at the bottom of the ocean!}}
{{L|[''Finn screams and tries to pull his emergency tab, but nothing happens'']}}
{{L|Jake| Maybe we should celebrate on land.}}
{{L|[''Jake grabs Finn and pulls his own emergency tab, so they both float to the surface'']}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake run onto the beach and fall backwards'']}}
{{L|Jake| I'm proud of you man. You did it!}}
{{L|Finn| Thanks, dude.}}
{{L|[''Fear Feaster comes out of Finn's navel'']}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| You've nothing to be proud of, boy! You will never get of your fear of the ocean!}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton?}}
{{L|Finn| [''To Fear Feaster''] What the flip, man? I just swam to the bottom!}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| No you didn't, cheater! You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero.}}
{{L|Finn| He's right. I'll never be a hero.}}
{{L|[''Finn's stomach rumbles and a black-smoke limousine comes out of him and parks nearby'']}}
{{L|[''The limousine’s windows roll down and Three Wise Men come out'']}}
{{L|Wise Man 1| Finn, you are wrong. The mark of a great hero is his flaw.}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| You know nothing, Wise Men!}}
{{L|Wise Man 1| Silence, Fear Feaster! We know a lot!}}
{{L|Finn| Wait... Why did you wait so long to tell me?}}
{{L|Wise Man 1| Because the limo driver's flaw is being late!}}
{{L|[[Limousine Driver|Limo Driver]]|Sorry. [''rolls up window'']}}
{{L|Wise Man 1| Farewell, Finn. You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo.}}
{{L|[''The Wise Men go back inside the limo and then the limo drives back into Finn'']}}
{{L|Finn| It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster!}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| What? Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life?}}
{{L|Finn| Everybody has a flaw... and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts.}}
{{L|[''Fear Feaster heads back into Finn's stomach'']}}
{{L|Fear Feaster| [''Sarcastically''] Wonderful...}}
{{L|Pat McHale| And so fear is forced deep within the soul of a hero. Conquered... at least, for now... [''Maniacal laugh'']}}
{{L|[''The episode ends'']}}
