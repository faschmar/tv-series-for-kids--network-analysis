{{L|Jake| You've got a lot of meat, Wildberry Princess.}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| Yeah, well, you know.}}
{{L|Finn| Thanks for cook-a-looking for us.}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| Oh, you're welcome, Finn, and thank you for answering my urgent summons.}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, yeah. How can we aid thee? [''Eats a piece of pie'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| Oh, it's nothing really. Someone's trying to kill me.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake spit take, their food flies in each other’s mouth, Finn gags'']}}
{{L|Jake| Still tastes good.}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| It's no big deal. Finish your pie.}}
{{L|Finn| It ''is'' a big deal, and I demand deets.}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| Okay.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Mouth full''] I'm listening, but I'm gonna keep eating. [''Chews pie tray'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| [''Goes over to a table''] I suspect that I've been targeted by the Guild of Assassins.}}
{{L|Finn| Whoa, how do you know?}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| I found this note stabbed to my door... man. [''Lifts up a note from the [[Guild of Assassins]] with a knife pierced through it'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Gasps''] Princess, we vow to protect your juice. Right, Jake?}}
{{L|[''Jake is devouring a pie messily'']}}
{{L|Jake| Sometimes, I think there's a monster who lives in my stomach, and that's why I'm hungry all the time. [''Giggles and continues eating'']}}
{{L|Finn| Uhh, Princess, let's continue this briefing outside. I can't look at his mouth when he gets like this.}}
{{L|[''Close-up of Jake's mouth belching, Finn and Wildberry Princess leave the room. Jake puts down the pie tin and wipes his mouth, eyes another pie and taps the table with his arm'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Whispering''] Princess, want me to finish off your pie? [''Jake stretches his hand into a Wildberry Princess-shaped puppet and imitates her voice''] Yes, Jake. All my pies. [''Jake begins to eat the pie when he sees something inside it. He continues eating to find a small cat''] Hmm...hehehehehehe, a tiny cat. [''The cat hisses and bares her claws at Jake''] Whoa!}}
{{L|[[Me-Mow]]| [''Jumps on Jake's face''] Quiet! Or you die! [''Points a syringe of poison at him''].}}
{{L|Jake| [''Gasps''] ''You're'' the assassin!}}
{{L|Me-Mow| [''Saluting''] Me-mow, assassin second class, ...but once I take out a princess, I g'aduate to full membership.}}
{{L|Jake| Well, I'm no princess, sister!}}
{{L|Me-Mow| Yes, I know, but since you've blown my cover, ''you'' will slay Wildberry Princess.}}
{{L|Jake| What!? I'd rather be injected with poison!}}
{{L|Me-Mow| Oh. Uh... okay.}}
{{L|Jake| I mean, I will assassinate Wildberry Princess.}}
{{L|Me-Mow| Good. Oh, and if you try to trick me, I'll poison you. [''Climbs into Jake's nose'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Stifled''] My nose! [''It should be noted that until otherwise noted all lines from Me-mow show her inside of Jake's nose'']}}
{{L|Me-Mow| Blagh! It's like worn garbage up in here!}}
{{L|(Finn and Wildberry Princess re-enter)}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| You done in there, Jake?}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, uh, yeah. So, um, Wildberry Princess. So, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be killed.}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| [''Nervously backs off''] W-w-why would you say that?}}
{{L|Finn| Dude, are you trying to freak her out?}}
{{L|Jake| I don't know. I'm just thinking out loud here.}}
{{L|Finn| Are you trying to freak ''me'' out?}}
{{L|Jake| Uh, I'm sorry, Wildberry Prin...cess... [''Hears bells, looks at a bag of meat, grabs Wildberry Princess's crown''] You should... let me... do something... and... it will be...good. [''Places Wildberry Princess's crown on the meatbag'']}}
{{L|Me-Mow| What's going on out there? [''Looks through Jake's nostril to see the meatbag with Wildberry Princess's crown'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Punching the meatbag''] Eat this! And that! Ooh, how do you like this, Princess! Duoo!}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| [''confused''] Uh... That's very good?}}
{{L|Jake| I'm gonna pick you up now and carry you... to the window!}}
{{L|[''Jake carries meatbag to the window'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, what are you...}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| No! Stop! Please!}}
{{L|[''Me-mow smiles, Jake tosses meatbag out the window and it splats on the ground'']}}
{{L|Jake| Wildberry Princess is dead! [''Puts a finger to his mouth''] Shh... [''Gives a thumbs up, Finn and Wildberry Princess are speechless'']}}
{{L|Me-Mow| You did it! Well done! I guess I'll be on my way.}}
{{L|[''Goes to pick up her syringe when a voice pipes up'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Guard #1| Princess! Oh, Princess! [''[[Wildberry Guard|Wildberry guards]] rush into doorway'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Guard #2| You're alive!}}
{{L|Wildberry Guard #1| We saw your crown next to a pile of dirtied meat, then we skipped on the meat and I thought I tasted your juice, but it was just blood from the meat. We're so glad it wasn't actually you!}}
{{L|Me-Mow| [''Angry yell''] Grraa!! You liar! [''She injects Jake with the half of the poison from the syringe'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''pained groan''] Oooh! [''Jake collapses over and his skin tint turns green'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake?}}
{{L|Me-Mow| Okay, Jake. I've injected you with half the poison, you'll be dead in thirty minutes, unless you kill the princess, which is when I'll give you the antidote [''Me-mow holds up a tube of pink liquid with her tail'']}}
{{L|Jake| Finn [''grabs Finn's shirt''] help me!}}
{{L|Finn| What's wrong?}}
{{L|Me-Mow| If you say anything, I'll stab you in the brain!}}
{{L|Jake| Uhh... Finn, uh, sing mom's lullaby. I'm so tired, Finn, from the meat. Please, you have to lull me to sleep.}}
{{L|Finn| Uhhh...}}
{{L|Jake| I know you carry mom's music box around in your backpack!}}
{{L|Finn| Dude, I'm not going to sing mom's lullaby in front of other people...}}
{{L|Jake| Please, pleeeaaase...}}
{{L|Finn| Alright, real quick while the princess is distracted. [''he pulls out the music box and starts playing it; he begins singing "[[Sleepy Puppies]]"''].}}
{{L|[''Finn starts to fall over, lulled to sleep himself'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Jake catches Finn with his hand jolting him awake''] [''whispers''] Finn there's an assassin in my nose and she poisoned me and is making me kill Wildberry Princess!}}
{{L|Finn| Dude, stop playing games! This is serious!}}
{{L|[''Jake covers Finn's mouth and grabs some meat from one of the pies and spells "cat → nose," but it's a bit sloppy'']}}
{{L|Finn| Cat... noise? Oh, cats go "meow." Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.}}
{{L|Jake| Shh!}}
{{L|Finn| Meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow!}}
{{L|Jake| Shh! Shh! Shh! [''Finn continues'']}}
{{L|[''Jake wraps Finn up in his arms to quiet him, Finn mumbles loudly'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''muffled''] Jake! Jake! What are you doing?!}}
{{L|Jake| [''whispers''] Sorry... [''Jake throws Finn out the window onto the meat from earlier''] [''whispers again''] Me-mow? Still asleep?}}
{{L|Me-Mow| [''asleep''] Gonna double cross Jake... and leave him to die...}}
{{L|Jake| Phew... If I can just grab that antidote... [''He pokes Me-mows face twice then grabs it''] Ah-ha!}}
{{L|Me-Mow| [''asleep''] Puppy... hoodies...}}
{{L|Jake| I did it!}}
{{L|[''Finn comes back in the door'']}}
{{L|Finn| What the flop, Jake!}}
{{L|Jake| [''quiet''] Noooooo!!}}
{{L|Me-mow| Treachery! Hiya! [''Me-mow injects Jake's hand with more poison'']}}
{{L|[''Jake groans in pain'']}}
{{L|Me-Mow| Time's running out, Jake! Do you want the antidote, or not?}}
{{L|Finn| What is wrong with you!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Clearly intoxicated''] Hey, everybody, everything's cool...}}
{{L|Finn| Everything's ''not'' cool, Wildberry Princess is still in danger!}}
{{L|Jake| Right, right, well, we should take her somewhere safer...}}
{{L|Me-Mow| Don't make me give you the rest.}}
{{L|Jake| I know where to stash you, princess. Follow me. [''Jake walks out'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to the top of a high cliff'']}}
{{L|Jake| Here, nobody can take us by surprise. Finn, stand here with your back to the cliff. I'll stay with Wildberry Princess. [''gravely''] To do what must be done. [''He prepares his hands to push Wildberry Princess'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| Oh, my, look at how close to the edge I am!}}
{{L|Me-Mow| Do it, Jake, do it!}}
{{L|Jake| I...I...I probably shouldn't!}}
{{L|[''A bird swoops down trying to eat one of the sausages in Jake's ears; it hits him in the head and knocks Me-mow out onto the grass'']}}
{{L|Finn| Huh? Jake!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Falls over weakly''] I'm full of poison...}}
{{L|Finn| The assassin!}}
{{L|Me-Mow| The name's Me-mow.}}
{{L|Finn| If you let Jake die, so help me I will kill you too!}}
{{L|Me-Mow| Try it, oaf!}}
{{L|Finn| Give me the antidote!}}
{{L|[''Me-mow jumps on Finn's arm and runs around to his back and up his head in a comically long sequence demonstrating her size, she then jumps in a tree'']}}
{{L|Finn| Face me, cat!}}
{{L|[''Me-mow spits a knife out of her throat, and climbs down a tree, same as previous style. She puts a small cut in Finn's leg'']}}
{{L|Finn| Ugh, ow!}}
{{L|[''Me-mow slices one of Finn's backpack straps and gives him a small cut on the cheek'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| [''shrieks, bent over the weakened Jake'']}}
{{L|Finn| Give it up, Me-mow! You're only making my face look cooler!}}
{{L|[''Finn throws his sword at Me-mow who is on a branch; it misses and gets stuck in the tree'']}}
{{L|Me-Mow| You're at my mercy!}}
{{L|Finn| Ha, you think you're hurting me? With that tiny dagger?}}
{{L|Me-Mow| We'll see who's laughing when you're blind!}}
{{L|[''Me-mow jumps at Finn's face, but he blows her away knocking her into a tree. Finn goes up to pin her to the tree, she puts her knife out and Finn puts his hand on it. He grunts but holds her'']}}
{{L|Finn| It's over! Give me the antidote!}}
{{L|Me-Mow| What, this antidote? [''Me-mow breaks the antidote on the tree'']}}
{{L|Finn| No! You... milk-lapper! [''Finn punches Me-mow out of his grip''] Jake, come lick this treebark!}}
{{L|Jake| I'm coming-- [''he starts crawling, but immediately puts his face to the ground'']}}
{{L|Me-Mow| Forget it, kid. I gave Jake enough poison to kill a dog fifty times his size.}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, no... [''starts crying next to Jake'']}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Wait! Oh yeah}}
{{L|Jake| [''Takes a deep breath and enlarges his liver to 51 times its normal size''] Dog liver times fifty-one!}}
{{L|'''Me-Mow: '''A magic dog? Nooooooo!!!!!!! [''Jake shrinks]'' }}
{{L|Finn| How you feeling, dude?}}
{{L|Jake| [''singing like a rockstar''] Big liver, big liver, yeah!!}}
{{L|Me-Mow| You've ruined me! I have to wait a whole year to retake the assassins test!}} 
{{L|Wildberry Princess| Aww! What if I made you my royal pet?}}
{{L|[''Me-mow jumps at Wildberry Princess in an attempt to attack her, but her berries pop off and Me-mow misses careening off the cliff'']}}
{{L|Wildberry Princess| Oh, dear....}}
{{L|Finn| Nice defense mechanism, Wild B!}} 
{{L|Jake| Are you naked?}} 
{{L|Wildberry Princess| Oh, no, this is a medical condition. I need a hospital [''groans'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hehe, we ''all'' need a hospital.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake laugh as they walk off with Wildberry Princess'']}}
{{L|[''Scene shifts to off the cliff: A bird flies by with Me-mow riding it. The episode ends with Me-mow glaring at Finn, Jake, and Wildberry Princess.'']}}
