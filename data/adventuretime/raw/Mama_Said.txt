{{L|[''The episode begins with King of Ooo showing Finn and Jake a surveillance video (while they sit on tiny stools) of a flying mushroom shot in the Candy Kingdom'']}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|[''Pointing to screen''] There. Right there. See?}}
{{L|Finn|[''Squinting''] Uhhh...Yeah. It's a small thing?}}
{{L|Jake|[''Moves uncomfortably''] Hey, do you have bigger chairs?}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|[''Glares''] Stools.}}
{{L|Jake|Huh?}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|[''Walking toward Jake''] They're stools; not chairs.}}
{{L|Jake|Well can I have a bigger stool, then?}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|Jake, stop interrupting!}}
{{L|Jake|Sorry.}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|Enhance!}}
{{L|Banana Guards|[''Push Finn and Jake while on the stools much closer to the TV'']}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa!}}
{{L|Jake|Looks like a mushroom. Someone throwing mushrooms?}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|Yes, very good, it is a mushroom! Or a toadstool. That's why you're sitting on stools.}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[''simultaneously''] Oh.}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|See, you guys gotta trust me on this one, okay? I picked those stools for a reason. Trust my process! You can get up now.}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[''get up and crack their backs'']}}
{{L|Jake|My legs.}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|No, nobody's throwing mushrooms. [''moves closer to the TV''] I believe they're flying on their own. That's where you two come in.}}
{{L|[''Finn, Jake, King Of Ooo, and two Banana Guards walk toward where the flying mushroom was shown'']}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|Okay, the flying mushroom came from that direction, [''points in direction flying mushroom came from''] so I want you two to head that way until you find one. A big one. and I want you to capture it, and bring it back.}}
{{L|Jake|Why?}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|Huh?}}
{{L|Jake|Why?}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|[''leans toward Finn and Jake''] Trust my process.}}
{{L|Jake|Okay, but why, though?}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, we're curious.}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|I wanna ride it around instead of walking. I think people will respect me more. [''Dirt Beer Guy walks by in background''] Hey. Hey, you, what's your name?}}
{{L|Dirt Beer Guy|I'm Dirt Beer Guy.}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|What would you think if you saw me on a giant flying mushroom? Dirt Beer Guy|Boy, that'd really be somethin'.}}
{{L|King Of Ooo|See? Don't fail on this one, boys. [''threateningly''] Don't you dare fail me.}}
{{L|Finn|[''Walking through forest with Jake''] Actually, I'm kinda glad we're walking in this direction. We never walk in this direction.}}
{{L|Jake|[''Stops walking, faces Finn''] Hey, how long do you think capturin' a flyin' mushroom takes?}}
{{L|Finn|[''Removing backpack''] Well we gotta find one first. [''Reaches in pack for something'']}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, that too. How long?}}
{{L|Finn|[''Takes out water bottle, drains about a quarter of it, wipes mouth''] Mm. An hour to capture, aaand, if we don't find him by dinner, we'll tell KOO to send out a Banana Guard patrol.}}
{{L|Jake|Tell who?}}
{{L|Finn|KOO.}}
{{L|Jake|...King Of Ooo?}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah.}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[''Laugh, continue to walk'']}}
{{L|Finn|Did you notice he was wearing Princess Bubblegum's clothes?}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, that was sorta cool. But you know, PB just left her kingdom to 'im. And all her stuff, so what's that about?}}
{{L|Finn|Hmm.}}
{{L|Jake|[''Sniffs, stops, nose and mouth stretch out forward and sniffs for something, turns around''] I smell mushrooms.}}
{{L|Finn and Jake|[''Run up a hill dotted with mushrooms'']}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, good job, Jake.}}
{{L|Jake|Check it out. [''points to a relatively large mushroom''] Big enough for KOO's tiny heiny!}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, the only thing, though, is it's not flying.}}
{{L|Jake|Mmm, yeah... [''Finn and Jake look around for a bit'']}}
{{L|Finn|I guess we could just sit here... and wait for it to fly?}}
