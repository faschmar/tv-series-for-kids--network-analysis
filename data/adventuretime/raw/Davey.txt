{{L|[[Candy Person 59|Lollipop Girl]]| Go away, weirdo.}}
{{L|Davey| Haha! [''Runs up to the bike store and then runs to the end of the street. He turns around and runs back. He grabs 3 coins out of the fountain. He then walks up to [[Cinnamon Bun]] who is dancing. Then he goes and sits on a bench and starts eating a coco bird'']}}
{{L|Coco Bird Vender| Hey! You've gotta pay for those, man. I'm trying to run a business here!}}
{{L|Davey| [''He walks up to the vender and hands him the bird.''] I gotta find a job! [''Runs to the fountain and tosses the three coins back in it. He enters the broom store''] I need a job!}}

{{L|[''Broom store owner takes a jar full of small brooms'']}}
{{L|[''At the treehouse in Finn and Jake's bedroom'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Takes off his mustache''] Man, today was awesome. Just normal, y'know? Just like a normal day. No drama, or any of that. Just super normal. Man it was great.}}
{{L|Jake| [''While lying in his bed''] That's cool. Goodnight, Finn.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Puts on his mustache''] I'm Davey.}}
{{L|Jake| Haha! Yeah.}}
{{L|Davey| I'm Davey! [''Eyes turn big.'']}}
{{L|[''In the morning, sounds of wood being chopped is coming from outside'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Wakes up''] Hey, Finn, you wanna have dinner instead of breakfast today? Finn? [''Wiggles his ears''] That must be him. [''Gets up and goes to the door'']}}
{{L|[''The Candy People are outside'']}}
{{L|Candy Person #1| I MADE YOU DINNER, FINN! WHERE WERE YOU?!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Opens the front door. Walks up to Davey''] Uhh.... What's going on?}}
{{L|Davey| Oh, heya, mister, thanks for putting me up last night. I'm just chopping some wood so's I can build a little log cabin to live in.}}
{{L|[''Jake gets shocked'']}}
{{L|Randy| [''Walks up to the scene and grabs the chopped wood''] Hey, I'm Randy.}}
{{L|Davey| Randy, wanna get dinner tonight?}}
{{L|Randy| Nah, I'm busy. I like to wonder at night.}}
{{L|Jake| Finn what's going on?}}
{{L|Davey| [''Takes Jake to the other side of the half-built cabin. So he can talk to him in private''] You gotta start calling me Davey, mister. Because that's my name!}}
{{L|[''Jake stands still, staring at "Davey"'']}}
{{L|Davey| [''Large-eyed''] Daaaaaaaaaavvvveeeeeeyyyyyy!!!}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, no! Have you lost your teacups, man?}}
{{L|Davey| Mister, I don't know nothing about that. I'm just a working joe... trying to stake my claim... under the sun... and look out on the beautiful green fields called... life!}}
{{L|Jake| Uhhhhhhhh........}}
{{L|Randy| Hey, Davey, where do you want these logs?}}
{{L|Davey| Oh, just attach 'em to the cabin. Like how it should be. So it looks like a cabin. We're gonna build a right wall and front wall. Ummmmm-}}
{{L|Randy| How about the roof? }}
{{L|Davey| Maybe, maybe.}}
{{L|Randy| I've been holding these.}}
{{L|Davey| They look good.}}
{{L|Randy| How do you put good looking wood on a cabin?}}
{{L|Jake| Gotta figure a way to get Finn to act normal. [''Then he sees BMO running in circles dressed as a robber'']}}
{{L|BMO| ''Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pewwww.....''}}
{{L|[''Randy and Davey are sitting on rocking chairs in front of the cabin and drinking soda while Jake comes in a robber costume'']}}
{{L|Jake| Ah! Give me the wallet! Or feel my claw! The wallet!}}
{{L|BMO| Watch out! A robber!}}
{{L|Jake| I'll cut you! I mean, rob you! [''Takes randy as a hostage'']}}
{{L|Davey| Oh, no!}}
{{L|Jake| I'm a robber and I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me. Unless there's a hero around here. [''In a suggestive tone''] Like there's someone here who is actually a ''hero'' in ''disguise''. They can probably stop me. [''Runs up to Davey and whispers''] C'mon, Finn. Be a hero.}}
{{L|Randy| What? What are we talking about?}}
{{L|Jake| Butt out, Randy!}}
{{L|Randy| [''While being pulled back''] Uhhhhhhhhhhhh.........}}
{{L|[''Davey goes into the cabin'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Whispers.''] Yes, Finn. Put on your awesome hat and beat me up.}}
{{L|Randy| What?}}
{{L|Jake| I'm not talking to you, Randy!}}
{{L|Davey| [''Comes out of the cabin''] I called the police.}}
{{L|Jake| Wait, what?}}
{{L|[''In the next scene, the banana guards are dragging Jake'']}}
{{L|Jake| Guys, it's not what it looks like! That guy isn't really named Davey. It's Finn! He brainwashed himself to become Davey and I was just trying to inspire him to go back to being Finn.}}
{{L|Banana Guards| Yeah, yeah. We've heard that before. C'mon robber!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Shouts to Davey.''] Finn, don't let the dragon drag on, man. Don't let the dragon drag on!}}
{{L|Davey| [''In Finn's voice''] Don't let the dragon........ Jake!}}
{{L|Randy| [''While drinking his soda and sitting on the rocking chair''] Well that was pretty unusual, wasn't it, Davey?}}
{{L|Davey| Get outta here Randy! [''In an exasperated tone and angry expression''] Geeeet ouuuuut! [''Hits a glass against the wall'']}}
{{L|[''Randy shrugs and walks off.'']}}
{{L|Davey| [''Takes off his mustache and starts talking to it''] No more Davey.}}
{{L|Mustache| But you love being Davey.}}
{{L|Finn| I do love being Davey, but being Davey caused Jake to get arrested.}}
{{L|Mustache| But remember that time when Davey sat in the park and saw some people walking around?}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, that was nice.}}
{{L|Mustache| And remember that time when Davey swept the floors?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Chuckles''] Yeah, that was great, too. But-}}
{{L|Mustache| Do you really wanna go back to being a famous hero? Why not just be Davey? A simple man... with simple goals and simple problems. You can just blend in and live the simple life.}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah.... Blend in. Y'know, maybe I'll be Davey just one more time! [''Puts the mustache on'']}}
{{L|Davey| One more time!}}
{{L|[''Banana Guards are deciding what to do while guarding the prisoners'']}}
{{L|Banana Guard #1| C'mon, man! That last game wasn't fair.}}
{{L|Banana Guard #2| How about: Who can hold up their hand the longest?}}
{{L|Banana Guard #1| Okay, this game breaks the tie.}}
{{L|Banana Guard #2| Okay.}}
{{L|Banana Guard #1| Last game.}}
{{L|Banana Guard #2| Last game.}}
{{L|[''They both hold up their hands while Davey comes in and sweeps the floor'']}}
{{L|Davey| Hey, fellas. How's tricks?}}
{{L|Banana Guard #2| Hm? Oh, hey Davey.}}
{{L|Davey| [''Goes next to Banana Guard #2 and whispers to himself''] Ah! Keys! [''Touches the key with his broom'']}}
{{L|Banana Guard #2| Hm? [''Starts shivering''] What's going on?}}
{{L|Davey| Ah. Would you care for a body sweep?}}
{{L|Banana Guard #2| Umm... yeah... sure. I do feel kinda dirty.}}
{{L|[''Davey starts sweeping Banana Guard #2's body'']}}
{{L|Banana Guard #1| Whew! You sure know how to party, Davey! [''The guards are struggling to hold their arms up'']}}
{{L|Davey| [''Knocks the keys into his pocket with the broom'']}}
{{L|Banana Guard #2| [''Cheers because he's winning''] Yes yes yes!}}
{{L|Banana Guard #1| No no no!}}
{{L|Davey| [''Walks up to Jake's prison while the banana guards are distracted. He opens Jake's prison door open with the key'']}}
{{L|Jake| Davey?!}}
{{L|[''Davey takes off his mustache'']}}
{{L|Finn| No, it's me, [''Finn's eyes grow big''] Finn!}}
{{L|Jake| Finn! [''Walks up to Finn'']}}
{{L|Banana Guard #2| [''Comes to Jake's prison''] Here's your meal, criminal. We feed our criminals. [''Realizes the prisoner is free. Drops the meal''] Hey, stop!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake run out of the prison with the guards following behind'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Puts Jake's robber clothes on a candy horse and sticks his mustache to the back of the horse. He takes his hat out and puts it on, then waves to the mustache''] Goodbye, Davey.}}
{{L|Mustache [''Davey'']| Goodbye, Finn.}}
{{L|[''Finn slaps the horses butt and the horse starts running. Then the Banana Guards come.'']}}
{{L|Banana Guard #2| Hey, there they go!}}
{{L|Banana Guard #1| Yeah, there goes Davey and the criminal.}}
{{L|[''They both see Finn''] Oh, hey, Finn! [''They start following Davey and the criminal'']}}
{{L|Finn| Good luck catching those guys!}}
{{L|Banana Guard #2| [''Shouts out to Finn''] Thanks!}}
{{L|Jake| [''In Finn's pocket''] Glad to have you back, buddy.}}
{{L|Finn| Word.}}
{{L|[''Jake turns his back and farts and the episode ends.'']}}
