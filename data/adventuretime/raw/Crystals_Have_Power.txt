{{L|[''Episode opens with [[Finn]] sitting at the kitchen table with giant crystal in his arms while searching through a holobook.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Hmm...}}
{{L|[[Jake]]|Yo, man, what's going on?}}
{{L|Finn|I found this crystal on our door step, it's pretty mysterious, I'm trying to find information about it using the holobook.}}
{{L|Jake|Oo, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough Guy contest! [''flexes bicep''] Whoo-hoo! [''Does a spin and poses''] Tough Boys!}}
{{L|Finn|[''Stares at crystal's side''] Wait man, doesn't this look like [[Tree Trunks (character)|Tree Trunks]]' lipstick?}}
{{L|[''Jake visualizes the scenario of Tree Trunks's explosion.'']}}
{{L|Jake|That's impossible, Tree Trunks exploded in the scary dark forest after she ate that [[Crystal Gem Apple]], remember?}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, I remember. [''looking solemn.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Come on man! Tough Guy contest me!}}
{{L|Finn|Ha! [''cheers up'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Flexes his bicep''] you got what it takes to rip-it?!}}
{{L|Finn|Uh, yeah! [''puts down crystal.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Then let's get it on!}}
{{L|[''The contest begins with Finn breaking a branch over his knee.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah-yo!}}
{{L|[''Pan over to Jake who is holding a chaise longue, he brakes it over his knee.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hee-yah!}}
{{L|[''Cue screen [Finn's voice] "Round Two, baby!"'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Holding out his arm''] Do it, Finn, do it! [''clenches fist.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''Pinches the skin on Jake's extended arm.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''His face wrinkles up trying to hold back a single tear. The tear is sucked back into his eye and Jake rubs his arm.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Quickly grabs for Finn's chest and twist.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''He begins to shriek but stops himself by biting his lip.''] [''A single tear tickles out of his eye and splashes onto the floor.] Noooooo!}}
{{L|[''Cue screen [Jake's voice] "Round Three"'']}}
{{L|[''Both Finn & Jake lock hands, trying to best the other. Finn puts Jake in a headlock.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Got you, dude!}}
{{L|Jake|I'm gonna break out! [''he begins to inflate in size.'']}}
{{L|Finn|No way!}}
{{L|Jake|[''Laughs and continues to inflate''] I'm breaking out of my fat! [''red and inflated''] I win, Finn! Finn? [''He finds that Finn is beneath him and quickly deflates''] Finn, Finn! Are you okay?! [''he rolls Finn over.'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''Turned on his back he begins to cough.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Touches Finn's face''] I was just messing with ya, dude.}}
{{L|Finn|[''Weakly''] I... was just... messing with... you [''poking Jake's forehead.''] [''He stands up and staggers to the tree's ladder.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Still concerned''] Are you okay?}}
{{L|Finn|[''Weakly and holding his stomach''] Yeah, [''breaths in''] I'm just going to rest my muscles. [''He climbs the ladder.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Oh dangit, Jake [''kicks a pink object''] you can't get all out of control like that! [''grabs a cup of juice''] Why am I like this?! [''echoing of last words''] like this... like this...}}
{{L|[''Flash back to Jake and his brother Jermaine in the forest, both have boxes gloves. Jermaine is face down in the grass while Jake cries over him.'']}}
{{L|[[Joshua]]|[''Walks up to them''] Jake, what did you do to your brother?}}
{{L|Jake|We were just playin' and then I got out of control! I'm sorry, dad.}}
{{L|Joshua|[''Pats Jake's head''] No, son, you did good. [''points at him''] Having no self control makes you a tough galoot, like me!}}
{{L|Jake|[''Teary eyed''] But I don't want to hurt nobody!}}
{{L|Joshua|Well, that's too bad, kid, 'cause you're going to hurt everybody!}}
{{L|Jake|[''Covering his ears and wails''] Noooo!}}
{{L|[''The flashback ends, Jake is still holding the cup, his eyes are wide and he is shaking'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Snaps out of it and tosses cup''] Whatevs', daddy! [''Huffs and crosses arms.''] [''He continues to huff, turn, and then another huff to sit on the couch.''] I'm never going to hurt anybody, ever, starting... now!}}
{{L|[''Close up of window as the sun goes down and night comes.''] [''Shot of Tree Fort's exteriors as a bird's crowing is heard and the sun comes up.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Sitting on the floor sipping coffee'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''Arrives in the kitchen and yawns''] 'Sup, dude?}}
{{L|Jake|Finn, you're okay! I was afraid I mashed your potatoes too hard last night.}}
{{L|Finn|Ha, you didn't mash my potatoes! [''quietly''] You didn't even make me cry silently into my pillow last night for- thirty minutes. In fact, you read to go again tough stuff?!}}
{{L|Jake|Nope, no more, dude.}}
{{L|Finn|What?!}}
{{L|Jake|I never wanna lose control again, man! I'm going totally soft [''body becomes blob like.'']}}
{{L|Finn|You look like a wuss!}}
{{L|Jake|Mmm hmm.}}
{{L|Finn|[''Laughs''] [''Notices the crystal on the table.''] Hey, the crystal is glowing a different color! [''Picking it up and turning it, it begins to glow brighter causing Finn to drop it'']}}
{{L|Jake|Whoa...}}
{{L|[''There is an explosion of bright light and Finn is knocked to the floor. Suddenly a portal appears and three [[Crystal Guardian|Crystal Guardians]] step through.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Chip-chap-chop, what's going on?!}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #1|Uh, which one of you is Finn the Human?}}
{{L|Finn|It depends on who's asking, are ya'll good or evil?}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #1|Uh, we're good.}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, I'm Finn}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #1|Get him! [''Finn screams.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Still sitting with his coffee''] Hey, you guys, put my bro down.}}
{{L|Finn|Jake! [''being taken away.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Finn! [''runs to the portal and jumps through.'']}}
{{L|[''Jake lands face down in the Crystal Dimension. He quickly recovers to see Finn in a large bubble like prison, guarded by a single Guardian'']}}
{{L|Finn|Hey!}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, man, what happened?}}
{{L|Finn|I don't know, but I'm trapped in this crystal ball, get me out of here!}}
{{L|Jake|Okay, I'll try to do it using 'controlled conversation' [''rolls over to prison's door way.'']}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3?|Halt.}}
{{L|Jake|Hey, man, I'm Jake.}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|Beat it!}}
{{L|Jake|[''Purses lips''] I wanna know why you took my buddy and I'm not going to use force to get it out of you.}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|I'm just following orders, bub.}}
{{L|Jake|Whose orders?}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|Um, well, it's a secret but part of it is we're turning Finn into a crystal.}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, you can stop these guys now! [''Two guardians appear and zap the crystal ball'']}}
{{L|Jake|Ah, man!}}
{{L|Finn|[''Pounding on the prison''] get me out of here!}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|No, you'll look awesome in crystal, like us!}}
{{L|Jake|Can't we work this out like gents?}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|Get lost! [''Kicks Jake'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Smashes into a crystal and gets a vision with his father speaking to him.'']}}
{{L|Joshua|Jake, lose control, flip out on those guys!}}
{{L|Jake|No, dad, I gotta control myself! [''His body morphs thin and long as he slithers back over to the doorway''] Control, control, control, con-trol.}}
{{L|Finn|[''Still surrounded by the two guardians, he is zapped again''] Help! My arm! [''His arm changes into crystal.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Whoa, okay okay. I'm hatching a controlled plan. Alright, man, move out of the way and let me get my friend.}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|Nope, not doing it.}}
{{L|Jake|Then I'll have to move you myself, [''zoom in of his mouth''] with my mind. [''Putting his hands to his head he concentrates intensely.'']}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|You're going to hurt yourself. Stop it.}}
{{L|Jake|[''His face gradually reddens.''] [''He stops once a fart is let out and breaths heavily.'']}}

{{L|Jake|No, no punchies! I am in control! [''covers his face and cries.'']}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|Who are you talking to?}}
{{L|Jake|Nobody, man, don't look at me! [''runs away crying.'']}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|Whoa, [''chuckling''] did you guys see that?}}
{{L|Crystal Guardians|[Chuckling] Yeah. Yes}}
{{L|Finn|Don't make fun of him, he's having problems, everybody has- [''he is zapped again.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Punches a crystal and puts his head against it''] Stupid-ghost-dad! I'll show him! [''calmly''] Okay, intimidate them with controlled attack.}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|Hurry up, guys, I gotta drop a crystal donk.}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #2|Oh, come on, I don't wanna hear that.}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|Hey, whatever man, I ain't ashamed- whoa, what the?! [''A shadow looms over him.'']}}

{{L|Jake|I'm not hurting you am I?}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|No, [''slapping hand away''] you freak!}}
{{L|Jake|Well, there's a lot more where that came from! So you best tell me why you're turning Finn into a crystal.}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|Or what, you'll touch me?}}
{{L|Jake|So, help me I will touch you!}}
{{L|Finn|[''Screaming''] JAKE! AHH! HELP!!}}

{{L|Crystal Guardian #3|[''Pushing Jake back''] cut it out he looks good.}}
{{L|Finn|MY BODY!! [''he turns completely crystal.''] [''The prison pops and he falls to the ground.'']}}
{{L|Jake|Nooo! My bud!! [''shrinks down.'']}}
{{L|Crystal Guardian #2|Ah, let him in, he can't do nothing now.}}
{{L|Jake|[''Runs over the crystallized Finn''] I'm sorry, Finn, I'm super lame and now...you're dead.}}
{{L|Finn|I'm not dead, I'm just all crystal stiff.}}
{{L|Jake|Oh.}}
{{L|A voice|Get your hands off My lover!}}
{{L|Jake|That voice.}}
{{L|Finn|It sounds like-}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|[''She appears from a corridor, hovering, pale skinned and crystal-eyed.''] Yes, Finn, it's me, Tree Trunks. [''Jake dragging Finn away''] but in this world I am known as Quartzion the Crystal Queen. }}
{{L|Finn|Oh my grosh, you're alive!}} 
{{L|Tree Trunks|Oh, I'm more than alive, Finn. After I ate that Crystal Apple in the scary dark forest, I was transported to this crystal dimension where I become ruler of the crystal men. And the crystal men are all in love with me.}}
{{L|[All three Crystal Guardians run up to Tree Trunks to profess their love.]}}
{{L|Crystal Guardians|Love you Quartzion! Quartzion, I love you! Quartzion, we love you! [''bows.'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Yes, yes I know, but you love... is not enough [''grins evilly''] [''Her eyes glow and from her trunk, a beam zaps the guardians into dust, Finn and Jake gasp.''] I wanted you, Finn, so you could be transformed into my sexy crystal king.}}
{{L|Finn|Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas with crystal power!}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Finn, it's not sexy for a king to call his queen bananas! [''she unleashes a beam of light that turns the surroundings into dust, but Jake grabs Finn and runs for cover.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, you totally gotta stop her!}}
{{L|Jake|I'll try man, but I'm still figuring out my bizz, [''stretches his legs to reach her height''] here I come, Tree Trunks! [''lightly touches her trunk''] Taste my gentle rubs!}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Whoa there, don't you put your junk on my trunk! [''wraps Jake up.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Go, Jake, go!}}
{{L|Jake|She's too sassy and powerful! [''gets thrown at a crystal.'']}}
{{L|Joshua|[''His disembodied voice is heard''] Jake, Jake, I brought someone here to see you, it's your brother.}}
{{L|Jake|Jermaine?! Are you dead?}}
{{L|[[Jermaine]]|Nah man, we're just dreamin' at the same time.}}
{{L|Jake|Oh, I'm sorry about that time I beat you up. }}
{{L|Jermaine|That was an accident, I knew you were just horsin' off!}}
{{L|Jake|But dad, you said I was going to hurt everybody!}}
{{L|Joshua|Yeah, every-bod-y.}}
{{L|Jake|I don't know, dad, that doesn't really help me.}}
{{L|Joshua|Everybody who is ''evil'', Jake. Let me finish next time, hm, yeah?}}
{{L|Jake|Oh, well then I'm over it then! Rarr [''charges back into battle.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, kick Tree Trunks in the tummy, shes probably still got that crystal gem inside her!}}
{{L|Jake|That must be giving her all her powers!}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Marry me, Finn, we can snuggle through time and space and kiss each other in an alternate dimensional place.}}
{{L|Jake|[''Morphs his foot into a giant boot and kicks Tree Trunks in the stomach.'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|[''Coughs up the Crystal Apple and returns to normal. The apple bounces off a wall, lands and opens a portal.''] Oh, dear.}}
{{L|Finn|[''Busts out of his crystal body and cheers.'']}}
{{L|Jake|TT, you're back.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Oh, Jake, I was behaving so inappropriately I'm so embarrassed.}}
{{L|Jake|Oh shush, Tree Trunks, if I had a penny for every time someone went crazy hopped up on magic energy... I'd be Abraham Lincoln!}}
{{L|Finn|Tree Trunks, you're okay!}}
{{L|Jake & Tree Trunks|Finn!}}
{{L|Finn|I'm okay toooo! [''does a cartwheel.'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Oh, Finn, I was trapped here for so long and all I could think about was you and how your so nice to me and I, and I just wanted to say... I think... you're cute and I like you.}}
{{L|Finn|[''Blushing''] Okay, okay, let's go.}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|Finn, when we get home, it's ''apple pie time''.}}
{{L|Finn|Ooooh!! [''picks her up and jumps through the portal, she giggles.'']}}
{{L|Tree Trunks|♪[[Apple Pie|Apple pie]] in the oven, Tell me you can taste lovin'♪}}
