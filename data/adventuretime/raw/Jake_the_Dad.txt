{{L|Jake| [''Jake goes to check on the pups.''] Hmm. [''He pokes T.V., picks up his arm, and drops it]. ''Kinda like a dead person. [''Returns to kitchen to cook''] They're just asleep. It's okay. Ya gotta be a tough dad. [''Slams the egg he was cracking onto the counter and knocks over the bowl''] AAAAHHHH! [''into holo-message player''] The puppies aren't moving!}}

{{L|Jake| AHHHH! [''Jake stretches over to the pups and does shoddy CPR on Charlie. The pups wake up annoyed and groaning''] Saved 'em! Mom's manual knows best!}}
{{L|[''Scene chages to daytime. The pups are playing with each other on the floor and Jake gathers them up and puts them on the couch'']}}
{{L|Jake| You guys are getting big! Okay! [''yawns''] Excuse me. Mom's manual suggests that I read you guys a story. [''Pulls out "[[Baby Eating Fox and the Babies]]"''] This was your daddy's favorite book when he was cute like you! [''Where his name, "Jake" is on the book he adds " 's beautiful puppies" and begins to read. The pups look anxious and look forward to the book. Half way through, he begins to hesitate.'']}}

{{L|{{Lyrics
|There once was five little babies who were very cute and very chubby.
|
|
|
|One day, they met a fox.   
|"I'm so hungry that there   
|must be something 
|wrong with <br> my stomach," said the baby <br> eating fox. 
|"Will one of you babies be so kind as to look inside my belly and see what's wrong"?
|
|
|
|"We all will!" said the babies who were as helpful as they were chubby.}}}}

{{L|Jake| This is a lot darker than I remember! Um, gimme a sec. [''Jake has realized how morbid the book is and goes to consult the manual''] Is this appropriate for babies?}}
{{L|Holo-Margaret| [''gasps''] Get that book out of here!}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, okay. Sorry sweeties, Mom's manual says no. [''T.V. throws a rubber duck at Jake's hat. Jake molds his head to form a new one'']}}
{{L|Lady| 자기야, 애들 데리고 나가서 바람좀 쐬고 오지 그래? ("Hey honey, why don't you go outside and have some fresh air with the kids?")}}
{{L|Jake| Take 'em out for fresh air huh? [''He stretches to look outside''] There m- there might be a giant fox out there. [''falls asleep''] Or some-some other predator. [''wakes up''] Hey! [''The pups were reading the book and Jake snatched it away''] This's not for babies! [''He throws the book out the window and it lands next to a sleeping fox'']}}
{{L|[[Mr. Fox]]| [''wakes up''] Hey, free book.}}
{{L|[''Mr. Fox returns to the foxes' collective home and shows them the book'']}}
{{L|Mr. Fox| Hey! Hey everybody look! Look at this book I found about eating babies! [''fox walla''] They just sit there while you eat them. [''Shows a picture of the baby walking into the fox's mouth'']}}
{{L|Fox #1| Whoa! Eatin' babies.}}
{{L|Fox #2| Why haven't we been eating babies this whole time? [''coughs out the rock it was eating'']}}
{{L|Mr. Fox| I don't know, but I'm going to go eat one right now. [''fox walla'']}}
{{L|[''Jake has the pups on leashes for a walk through he woods'']}}
{{L|Jake| Okay everyone, your mom wanted me to take y'all out side. [''T.V. reaches for a flower, but is pulled back''] Ah ah ah, be careful. [''Charlie flies up to catch a butterfly, but is pulled down''] No Charlie, no. Too much germs, you know? [''The butterfly glances back in response to being called "germy"''] Everybody just stick together and don't do anything and we can all take a nap.}}
{{L|[''The pups are disgruntled and when Jake falls asleep, they all teleport out of their leashes'']}}
{{L|Jake| Then- [''Jake walks into a spiky branch''] Ah! Uh! [''opens his eyes to find Jake Jr. playing with a rust sword, Kil Whan putting various mushrooms on his nose, Charlie dancing with a frog, T.V. swinging on a branch, and Viola in a tree'']}}
{{L|Jake| AHHHH! OH MY GLOOB! No! NoOoOoO! IT'S EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE! NO! No! Noo! [''Jake scrambles to catch his pups as they run away like it's a game''] Put that down! Get outta there! Ah, come back! Wait T.V., you're gonna hurt yourself! Charlie, nooooo! Viola, wait!}}
{{L|Lady| [''Lady sees them through the window''] 얘들아! 비올라! 제이크 2세! 그만해! 찰리! 김길환! 아빠 좀 고만 괴롭히고 안에 들어와! ("Hey kids! Viola! Jake Jr.! Stop it! Charlie! Kim Kil-Whan! Stop messing with daddy and go inside!")}}
{{L|Jake| [''Lady comes down to see Jake''] Hey Lady. These puppies are really wearing me out, you know? I can hardly keep my eyes open.}}
{{L|Lady| 제이크, 자기 혼자 난리치는 거야. 우리 애들 걱정 안 해도 돼. 자기가 너무 과잉보호라니까. ("Jake, you're getting obsessed just all by yourself. Our kids have nothing to worry about. You're being overprotective.")}}
{{L|Jake| No, no it's- it's all in the manual you see- it's- it-it's got a fe- [''falls asleep'']}}
{{L|Lady| 아이야이야. 필요 없을 때만 난리라니까. ("Ai yai yai! He makes a fuss whenever it's not necessary.")}}
{{L|Fox #3| [''The foxes are eyeing Jake from the bushes''] Is that a baby? It doesn't look right. Why's he so sweaty. And hairy.}}
{{L|Mr. Fox| Look, fellas, there's never gonna be a perfect baby. Times like this ya just gotta dive right in. [''The foxes move in'']}}
{{L|Lady| Goochy goochy goo! [''Playing with Viola''] 아, 얘들아, 가서 아빠 좀 도와드려라. [''Oh, kids, go and help dadddy.''] [''Lady sees the foxes drag Jake away through the window'']}}
{{L|Jake| What the- What are you doing?! Let me go! [''struggles in vain''] Hold on, hold on a minute. Just- just lemme- Y'all better watch out! [''Tries to stretch, but is too tired. He looks up and sees the pups flying towards him''] Puppies?! What are you doing?! Go back inside! The manual's gonna flip!}}
{{L|Jake Jr.|Dad! The manual's a buncha ''junk!'' Just give us a chance.}}
{{L|Jake| Jake Jr.! You said your first words! "The manual's a buncha junk!" ... The manual's a buncha junk? Hmm. [''Flashback begins. Margaret is protecting Jake from a cobra in front of a butcher's shop'']}}
{{L|Flashback Margaret| Stay back Jakey, my manual says it's too dangerous. [''Holding holomanual that is freaking out (it's all it can do anyway)'']}}
{{L|Flashback Jake| Mom. Your manual's a buncha junk! Look what I can do! [''Flexing his mutant powers' muscle (and his independence), Jake gives the cobra an extra-large knuckle sandwich and laughs'']}}
{{L|Flashback Margaret| Oh... dear... glob! [''Flashback ends'']}}
{{L|Jake| I'm sorry for being such a little stinker kids. Come on and show the old man watcha got!}}
{{L|Pups| 수학! ("Mathematical!") [''The pups crash into the ground and form a Super Pup''] 아빠 몸체이동! [''Move Dad into body!")}}''
{{L|Jake| [''Jake is beamed into the middle of the super pup''] Whoa! What the-}}
{{L|Pups| 무지개 뱅! ("Rainbow Bang!") [''The pups blast the foxes to temporarily blind them''] 프리즘 TBA 작동! ("Initiate prism cyclone!") [''They spin like a spinning top, throwing and zapping the foxes'']}}
{{L|Jake Jr.| [''The super pup disassembles''] Ya see, dad? We flippin' crushed it. '''Crushed''' it!}}
{{L|Jake| You did! I'm super proud y'all and I'm duper sorry too. [''Gathers the pups in his arms''] I've been tryin' to make you know about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.}}
{{L|Lady| [''Lady flies up excited''] 애기들아! 참 잘했어! 너네 정말 대단했어! ("Well done, babies! You were awesome!")}}
{{L|Jake| Yup! I've been tryin' to make them about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.}}
{{L|[''BMO sings the "[[Bread Song]]." BMO is dancing and singing on Finn's stomach while holding bread all the while Finn has BMO's controller in his mouth tapping out a beat and laughing'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hey guys. I'm back. [''walks up the stairs'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''BMO and Finn look over concernedly''] Is everything okay?}}
{{L|BMO| Did you ruin it?}}
{{L|Jake| Nah, nah, it's cool. It turns out the pups can pretty much take care of themselves. They don't really need me around.}}
{{L|Finn| Oh.}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah. I guess rainicorns age really fast. They're basically like older than me already. Kil Whan has a beard now!}}
{{L|Finn| Oh!}}
{{L|Jake| Ah, it's okay! I got a slammin' family right here too! [''hugs them''] Plus all my stuff is here.}}
