{{L|Finn|♪A truer friend, there was none.♪}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|♪ And Prismo was his name.♪}}
{{L|Jake|♪An artisan of pickling, and now just one remains.♪}}
{{L|Jake|♪And now just one♪— [''crying noises''] I can't do this, man! I-it just can't be over!}}
{{L|Finn|Hey... We can put it back in the fridge, if you want.}}
{{L|Jake|No, these picks were made by our friend to be mouth-loved!}}
{{L|[''Jake walks over to the pickle jar while making kissing noises, then suddenly stops'']}}
{{L|Jake|We have to honor his memory with a final taste of his genius. [''picks up pickle jar''] Get ready for the dream ritual.}}
{{L|[''Finn bangs gong, they start humming and then burst into dance'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|[''screaming''] Prismo we love you forever in our dreams!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake start chanting'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|[''screaming, getting progressively louder''] Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA!}}
{{L|Jake|Finale!}}
{{L|[''Jake stretches into a large ball shape and juggles food items with several hands while they hum. Jake stretches his tongue down to the pickle in the jar, and eats it. A blast of light explodes from the jar.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Whoof! What was that?}}
{{L|Jake|Quick, to bed! This has to be the last thing we think about!}}
{{L|[''Jake grabs the jar, and they run off to bed'']}}
{{L|Finn|Hyup! [''jumps into bed'']}}
{{L|Jake|Okay... dream! [''closes eyes'']}}
{{L|[''Screen fades to black, cut to Tree Fort at day time'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''mumbles''] Aughhh! [''Finn sees thorn in hand, sits up panting''] Whoo! Crazy dream, man. Prismo was definitely in it, but—Jake?}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Jake's bed, with only the pickle jar in it'']}}
{{L|Finn|You up already?}}
{{L|[''Finn walks to window, sees Jake re-enacting the burial of the [[Everything burrito]]'']}}
{{L|Finn|What the...}}
{{L|Jake|[''grunting''] Whup! Oof. [''crying''] I love you, Everything Burrito.}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, why are you pretending to dig up Everything Burrito?}}
{{L|Jake|Huh, what?}}
{{L|Finn|Hold on, I'm coming down.}}
{{L|[''Jake explodes into dust, Finn comes running out of the Tree Fort'']}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, you gotta hear my dream, I—Jake?}}
{{L|Jake|[''re-enacting teaching the [[Dancing Bug]] to dance''] Hey, man, you're shaking it all wrong!}}
{{L|Finn|What the jump?}}
{{L|Jake|[''points at ground''] Shh. Let me show you how.. it's... done!}}
{{L|[''Music starts playing, and Jake dances'']}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, are you sleepwalking?}}
{{L|Jake|No, I'm showing this— Whoaaaa! [''Jake explodes into dust again'']}}
{{L|[''Finn screams'']}}
{{L|Finn|Wake! [''slaps himself''] Up! [''slaps himself again''] Tunk... I'm not dreaming!}}
{{L|Jake|[''appears in Tree Fort doorway''] You made an oath. Okay.}}
{{L|[''Finn screams, turns to look at Jake'']}}
{{L|Jake|Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.}}
{{L|Finn|[''running towards Jake''] Jake! I saw you explode. Something messed up is haps, bruh.}}
{{L|Jake|Pshhh. Please, not even. [''folds arms'']}}
{{L|Finn|No, man, you blew into chunks over there! [''Finn points backwards, Jake looks surprised'']}}
{{L|Jake|Uh, because [[Kee-Oth]] was right there! A-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. Uuuuuhhh... [''faints'']}}
{{L|Finn|Jake, this already happened. C'mon, man, stop freakin' me out [''kicks Jake, who then explodes into dust again'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''coughing''] Ugh, Jake dust!}}
{{L|Jake|[''distantly''] ♪ [[Bacon Pancakes|Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes]] ♪}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to kitchen where Jake is re-enacting making pancakes'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''while Finn climbs up behind him''] ♪ Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes ♪}}
{{L|Jake|♪ Take some bacon and I'll put it in a pancake ♪}}
{{L|Jake|♪ Bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make ♪}}
{{L|Jake|♪ Bacon pancaaake! ♪}}
{{L|Finn|Dude, what is the deal?}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to various sections of the [[Time Room]]'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''zooming in on him''] Dude, what is the deal?}}
{{L|Prismo|[''appearing from the right''] Huh hmm huh hmm huh hmm. I can't wait to get this batch of pickles to Jake. He's totes gonna bust a pipe when he gets hit with the cumin and the undertones of sage that come in later. [''disappears'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''exasperated''] Prismo, I'm right here! Where you going, bro!? [runs off]}}
{{L|Jake|[''calling out''] Wait up, man, how're you alive!? [''Prismo pulls a brick back in the wall and appears for a brief second after Jake passes by''] Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the— [''gasps'']}}
{{L|[''Jake's path ends at the [[Wake Up|scene where the Lich kills Old Man Prismo]]'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''shocked''] The Lich?!}}
{{L|The Lich|Wake up.}}
{{L|[''The Lich shakes old man Prismo awake'']}}
{{L|Prismo|Wa—Wait, I've changed my mind—[''gasp'']}}
{{L|[''Prismo is off from the walls—his dream self dies.'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''watching from above''] Wait, why is this happening? It's like a rerun of the worst junk.}}
{{L|[''The Lich kills old man Prismo and is subsequently crystallized by a Citadel Guardian and is taken away with Finn and Past Jake holding on'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''while watching the above''] Lich life-sucks Prismo's dream host, eliminates Prismo forever. Ugh, it's mad gris bro. And then the Space Police, or whatever they're called, show up because boppin' Prismo is a cosmic crime. I remember feelin' like someone had peeled a layer away from my brain, and my reality was no longer anchored to any point of reference, and I had to fight to keep from being crushed under the weight of an unforgiving new paradigm of ultimate reality. So cool, man. So why am I seeing this again?}}
{{L|[''Jake makes his way from the ledge to the edge of the space hole'']}}
{{L|[''The Time Room disassembles, several blocks at a time and then a path appears in front of Jake'']}}
{{L|Jake|Uhhh, that's cool...}}
{{L|[''Scene jumps back to a bored Finn at the Tree Fort'']}}
{{L|Jake|Uhh, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough guy contest! [''flexes bicep''] Whoo-hoo! [''Does a spin and poses''] Tough boys!}}
{{L|Finn|[''groans'']}}
{{L|Jake|Come on, man! Tough Guy contest me!}}
{{L|Finn|[''while Jake continues his re-enactment behind him''] Okay, seems like all of Jake's remanifesting themselves, [''turns to viewer''] but as soon as I break their history it creates a paradox and Jake explodes.}}
{{L|Jake|[''turning to Finn''] Whoa, Finn, how'd you get over there? [''explodes into dust'']}}
{{L|Jake|Finn, when I die my individual Earth consciousness is going to go all over everywhere while [[Grob Gob Glob Grod|Glob]] tallies my deeds.}}
{{L|Finn|[''confused''] What?}}
{{L|Jake|I'm going to all around you [''starts turning into a tree''], in your nose, in your dreams and your socks...}}
{{L|Finn|"in your dreams?"}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, that's what I said, in your dre— [''explodes into dust'']}}
{{L|Finn|All this striz happened when Jake and I tried to preserve Prismo's pickles in our dreams, something must have changed when we went to sleep!}}
{{L|Finn|[''zooms out to the still messy room''] So, ugh, I just got to hope that Jake tries to do the pickle ritual again. So I can re-enact it with him. Exactly the way it happened, maybe?! Geez!}}
{{L|Jake|[''re-enacting Prismo's ritual'']♪ Fallen ally, fallen ally, you're home now in the sky.}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|♪ Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry.♪}}
{{L|[''Scene jumps back to the Time Room'']}}
{{L|Jake|I guess I'm headed towards that door..}}
{{L|Prismo|[[Jake the Dog (episode)|Dude, I get out of relationships]] because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna to have for dinner ''every night''! [''more distantly''] 'Cause when I'm alone...}}
{{L|Jake|Hehe, all these dudes and their lady problems...}}
{{L|Prismo|That's right, Prismo is nothing but the dream of a wrinkly old man.}}
{{L|Jake|What if the whole world was just some goof's dream? Man, that would be stupid. Whoa!}}
{{L|[''Camera pans out to reveal that Jake has entered a large room with a floating bed in an alcove on the far side'']}}
{{L|Jake|<nowiki>Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!? This couldn't be a...oh Grod! [</nowiki>''looks under the bed''<nowiki>] Permanent, opposing, industrial-strength, magnetic bed! [</nowiki>''looks at the side''<nowiki>] Hand-hewed from a single tree [</nowiki>''looks at the bedspread''<nowiki>] Oh, man! Look at this mattress! [</nowiki>''gasps''<nowiki>] What is it? [</nowiki>''sniffs''<nowiki>] Smells like a blend of cashmere... [</nowiki>''sniffs again''<nowiki>] Mohair, silk and wool maybe... [</nowiki>''touches the blanket''<nowiki>] The thread count on this is in the thousands! And it's filled with... [</nowiki>''sniffs''<nowiki>] Down feathers of a baby griffin! That's illegal! [</nowiki>''Turns to nightstand''<nowiki>] Glass of milk... This feels like a trap designed by some kind of sick genius!</nowiki>}}
{{L|Jake|Well... [''gulps milk and gets in the bed''] hats off to you sir or madam, your trap was a success!}}
{{L|Jake|Oh my blahs! [''tears up''] It's like I'm getting Eskimo kisses from an army of angels! [''Starts crying and suddenly falls asleep, snoring'']}}
{{L|Prismo|[''Suddenly appearing''] Oh, dang, I'm back!}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|[''still re-enacting Prismo's ritual'']♪ Prismo we love you forever in our dreams! ♪}} 
{{L|[''Finn and Jake start chanting'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|[''screaming, getting progressively louder''] Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA!}}
{{L|Jake|Finale!}}
{{L|[''Jake stretches into a large ball shape and mimes juggling food items with several hands while they hum. Jake stretches his tongue down to the table (there is no jar), and mimes eating a pickle.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Whoof! What was that?}}
{{L|Jake|Quick, to bed! This has to be the last thing we think about!}}
{{L|[''Jake mimes grabbing the jar, and they run off to bed. Jake picks up the pickle jar in his bed'']}}
{{L|Finn|Hyup! [''jumps into bed'']}}
{{L|Jake|Okay... dream! [''closes eyes'']}}
{{L|[''A ding is heard and a bright light from the pickle jar shines out and Jake disappears'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''stunned''] Whoa! The pickle jar! I'm coming Jake! [''jumps into the jar and gets warped away'']}}
{{L|[''Finn materializes in the Time Room'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''looking around'']Whoa...Where the heck am I?}}
{{L|Jake|[''calling out''] Wait up, man, how're you alive!?}}
{{L|Finn|Jake!? I'm coming man![''runs off'']}}
{{L|Jake|Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the—}}
{{L|Finn|Jake! Don't explode!}}
{{L|Prismo|[''reaching his arm out in front of Finn, making him stop'']Finn, hold up.}}
{{L|Finn|Prismo! I saw you die, dude!}}
{{L|Prismo|Yep, I'm still dead. I'm actually talking to you from the past, I set up this plan B scenario in case I ever got croaked for reals. So if this is happening then I guess I got croaked and my pickles ran out. But Jake and I established a bro-bond that could bring me back through his dreams.}}
{{L|Finn|So, are you actually talking to me right now or are you pretending to in an empty room?}}
{{L|Prismo|I was pretending, but now I can see you.}}
{{L|Finn|[''makes air quotes'']What does 'now' meant to you?}}
{{L|Prismo|Uhhh...hurry up I need your help [''opens wall and Finn walks through'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''Running past''] Where you going bro? Wait up man, how're you alive?}}
{{L|Finn|So where're we going?}}
{{L|Prismo|You've gotta wake up Jake and then...umm, you'll see.}}
{{L|Finn|I'll see what, Prismo?}}
{{L|Prismo|Shoot, I don't know if I thought this thing all the way through..}}
{{L|Finn|[''shocked''] Whaaaat?}}
{{L|Prismo|Aw, it'll be cool. [''nervously''] It'll be cool.}}
{{L|[''Jake snores while sleeping in the bed'']}}
{{L|Revived Prismo|Dude, I can't believe I died. Jake I'm sorry man. This doesn't feel right.}}
{{L|Past Prismo|[''appearing with Finn''] Ok, go wake Jake up and bring him back here [''Finn gives the thumbs up and runs to the bed'']}}
{{L|Revived Prismo|Whoa, Finn, hey, are you gonna wake up Jake?}}
{{L|Finn|Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though?}}
{{L|Revived Prismo|My past self is doing plan B right?}}
{{L|Finn|Uh, yes. Although I gotta say that this is as rickety as yoga balls.}}
{{L|Revived Prismo|Yeah, tell me about it.}}
{{L|Finn|You tell you about it!}}
{{L|Revived Prismo|I think you would blow up if I did that.}}
{{L|Finn|Well, anyway, here I go. [''shakes Jake''] Hey, Jake, wake up.}}
{{L|[''Jake groans sleepily'']}}
{{L|Revived Prismo|I'm out. [''vanishes'']}}
{{L|Jake|[''sleepily''] Hey, Finn, what's going on?}}
{{L|Finn|We gotta bounce.}}
{{L|Jake|[''pushing Finn away''] No, bro, don't tear me away from nirvana. Wait, nooo! [''falls to floor''] Oof! [''normal voice''] I'm okay now.}}
{{L|Finn|Cool [''leading Jake back to Past Prismo''] this way!}}
{{L|Past Jake|Whoa! Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!?}}
{{L|Jake|Prismo?! You're alive! [''hugs Prismo's nose on the wall'']}}
{{L|Prismo|Well, not yet. Finn, in a second you've gotta stop yourself from waking up Jake.}}
{{L|Finn|[''confused''] Stop my who?}}
{{L|Prismo|[''panicked''] Shoot! Hide!}}
{{L|[''Jake flattens himself and covers Finn into the wall, fortunately Jake is the same color as the wall'']}}
{{L|Past Finn|Think we should turn around somewhere, I feel like we're lost.}}
{{L|Past Prismo|No I was just stalling, don't think about it, c'mon, this way.}}
{{L|Prismo|THAT who.}}
{{L|[''Finn pushes his extended tongue back into his mouth'']}}
{{L|Prismo|But wait, Jake, that means one of your alternate reality incarnations will sleep for eternity to keep me alive.}}
{{L|Jake|Cool, dude!}}
{{L|Prismo|OK, Finn, I'm not sure what'll happen if you confront yourself. He might explode.}}
{{L|Finn|'He', me or other me?}}
{{L|Prismo|You know what? Forget it.}}
{{L|Finn|Shut it Prismo, heroes risk everything for their friends. Although I admit you're more Jake's friend than mine. Sometimes you can think someone is totally cool, but you never become besties. Now I don't know why that happens, but regardless let's do this. [''dashes out after his past self'']}}
{{L|Prismo|Good luck!}}
{{L|[''Past Finn walks up the bed to revive Jake'']}}
{{L|Revived Prismo|Whoa, Finn, hey! Are you gonna wake up Jake?}}
{{L|Past Finn|[''while Finn walks up behind him''] Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though?}}
{{L|Prismo|My past self is doing plan B, right?}}
{{L|Finn|[''tapping Past Finn on the shoulder''] PLAN B!}}
{{L|Past Finn|[''shocked''] What the—!? [''explodes into light and a sword appears in the center'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''grabbing the sword'']This is me? This sword is me?}}
{{L|Prismo|Finn sword, dude.}}
{{L|Finn|Welcome back, Prismo.}}
{{L|Prismo|Thank you, Finn.}}
{{L|Jake|[''Sticking his head out and giving the thumbs up''] Welcome back, Prismo.}}
{{L|Prismo|Thank you, Jake.}}
