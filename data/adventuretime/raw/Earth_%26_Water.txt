{{L|[''The episode begins in the [[Tree Fort]], where [[BMO]] is starting up a game of [[Sumo Scootz]].'']}}
{{L|BMO|Sumo Scootz! [''making sfx for the game''] Vroom vroom skreeee! [''[[Jake]]'s character defeats [[Finn]]'s''] Winner!}}
{{L|Jake|Whoo! 79th consecutive victory! [''[[Stretchy Powers|stretches]] his buttocks toward Finn's face''] In yo fa-ace! [''Finn doesn't react''] You okay, buddy? [''hits Finn's cheek with one of his buttocks''] Still bummed out about [[Flame Princess]]?}}
{{L|Finn|[''nods'']}}
{{L|Jake|Hmm. I know what'll fix you up: girl's night out, boy style! First, we'll go to the salon, get yo hair did and your nails all—wait, no. First, we'll go to the shops, get you a brand new hat. Then, we'll—[''toilet flushes''] [''gasps''] [''hides in the couch''] A burgler-mer!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake approach the bathroom door, and Finn kicks it open. [[Ice King]] is washing his hands.'']}}
{{L|Finn, Jake, & Ice King|Aah!}}
{{L|Finn & Jake|The Ice King? Grr—eh! [''Jake holds his nose'']}}
{{L|Ice King|Jeez, you couldn't wait two seconds?}}
{{L|Finn| Ech. [''pinches nose''] [''nasally''] Why are you stinkin' up our house?}}
{{L|Ice King|Didn't you get my text? It said I'm stayin' [''takes out banana phone''] with you guys—[''looks at phone''] oh, didn't go through. Well, anyways, I knew you wouldn't mind since it's sorta your fault I'm homeless, right?}}
{{L|Finn|Right.}}
{{L|Ice King|'Cause you tricked your crazy ex into meltin' my [[Ice Kingdom]]?}}
{{L|Finn|Mmhm.}}
{{L|Ice King|With your lies and secrets? 'Member when that happened?}}
{{L|Jake|Dude, you can't stay here if you're gonna stank it up with your bad vibes, man!}}
{{L|[''Ice King sprays air freshener, and Finn and Jake cough.'']}}
{{L|Ice King|Yeah, I'm just crashing here while the [[penguins]] rebuild. I've given [[Gunter]] temporary reign.}}
{{L|[''Gunter, wearing Ice King's crown, is shown constructing ice structures.'']}}
{{L|Ice King|Should be fine.}}
{{L|Finn|Flame Princess isn't crazy.}}
{{L|Ice King|You're blind, Finn. You're blind—wait, she isn't here, is she?}}
{{L|Finn|No.}}
{{L|Ice King|Whew!}}
{{L|Finn|She said she wanted time to herself. [''walks out'']}}
{{L|Ice King|Yeesh.}}
{{L|Jake|Yeah, breakups are tough.}}
{{L|Ice King|Heh, yeah, like, remember how you and I were married?}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to a forest with smoke rising from it. Flame Princess rips up some grass and burns it.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Uh! It's so confusing!}}
{{L|[''A spider-like creature lowers itself on its silk near Flame Princess.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Hmm? [''to creature''] I thought Finn was a stand-up guy, you know? But he basically betrayed me.}}
{{L|[''Spider creature shakes his head sympathetically.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Why do people even ''have'' secrets?}}
{{L|[''Her [[Flame Powers|heat radiation]] intensifies and the spider hurriedly scrambles up its silk.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess|It's like that in the [[Fire Kingdom]], too. Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare. But out here doesn't seem any different. [''scribbling sounds are heard''] Why do I have to feel like this? [''hears scribbling sounds''] And what is that noise?! Grrr!}}
{{L|[''She sees the spider crawling in mid-air. [[Princess Bubblegum]], invisible, punches the spider off of her face.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Eh.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|[''squints'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|[''turning off invisibility''] Yeah, yeah. Just act like I'm not here.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|[''gasps''] Are you spying on me?!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|What?! No, of course not!}}
{{L|[''Several cameras and a microphone spontaneously reveal themselves. Princess Bubblegum hits a button on her watch and they become invisible again.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|I was observing you—for research. [''sighs''] You're a threat, Flame Princess. Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels. But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix, I can isolate and suppress your more... volatile traits.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|So, if you do your research, you'll know how to cut off my emotions so I won't feel like this?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Umm, yeah, basically!}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Then I'll help you.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|You will?}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Yes. I'll do whatever it takes.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Flame Princess strapped down in a metal room with Princess Bubblegum and [[Cinnamon Bun]] observing from behind a large glass window.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|[''talking into microphone''] Once I press this button, you'll be subjected to a battery of tests to gauge your reflexes, stamina, and your reaction to various emotional stimuli.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|This is going to help me understand myself?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|There's a 40% chance we'll be able to identify and isolate your chemical components—and yes, understand you in a very scientific way.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Oh. That's good... I guess.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Initiate test. [''a phone drops down and knocks her hand away from the button''] Yah. [''puts phone to her ear''] Hello?}}
{{L|Jake|Princess! We need you and your [[Ball Blam Burglerber]] right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes, or [[snow-a-constrictors]]!}}
{{L|[''Snow-a-constrictors are shown wrapped around Ice King and Finn, who is hacking at one with his [[Demon Sword|sword]].'']}}
{{L|Jake| Aaaah—[''gets disconnected'']}}
{{L|[''Princess Bubblegum hits the button, lowering a large metal contraption towards Flame Princess. A small screen hanging by a cord drops down.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Okay, Cinnamon Bun, all you have to do is write down the numbers that appear on this monitor. Can you do that one thing?}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|Yes.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Oh, one other thing. Do ''not'' open that door. [''points to a door behind Flame Princess''] So that's two things: write down the numbers, do not open that door. Got it?}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|Yes, Princess.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Cinnamon Bun opening the very same door as the floor underneath him stretches toward Flame Princess.'']}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|[''laughs''] Hello.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Hello.}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|You look sad.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Yeah, but mostly I'm confused.}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|Ha, me too.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Really?}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|Yeah. Bubblegum is bad.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|She is?!}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|I don't know. Wanna pet my dog?! He lives at my house.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|What about the tests?}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|I'm not good at tests.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Cinnamon Bun's house, where Flame Princess is sitting on the couch next to Cinnamon Bun's "dog" (a squash with a mop on its head). Cinnamon Bun is preparing tea.'']}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|La-de-da-de-da [''hums''] His name is Jake, but he's not the real Jake. [''walks into coffee table, leaving a notch in his leg''] Ow. My body is soft. [''extends leg toward Flame Princess'']}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess places her hand on the wound, healing it perfectly.'']}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|[''gasps''] [''shakes his leg''] We're friends.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Yeah, I really get you, but sometimes friends are hard to understand. Sometimes you think you know them, but you find out they're just playing mind games.}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|Is the princess your friend?}}
{{L|Flame Princess|I don't know.}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|Yeah, because why did she lock you up in jail when you were a little baby? That was a weird friend thing.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|[''gasps'']}}
{{L|[''Title card: 15 YEARS AGO. Scene cuts to the Fire Kingdom.'']}}
{{L|[[Messenger]]|The word! The word!}}
{{L|[[Flame King]]|What's the word?}}
{{L|Messenger|The word is your newborn baby will have greater powers than you'll ever dream of.}}
{{L|Flame King|Uh... have my baby sent into the wilderness of the outside world to perish.}}
{{L|Messenger|Okay! [''runs off'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to the messenger carrying a baby Flame Princess through a forest. He sets her down, and she tries to walk but falls backwards. The messenger catches her.'']}}
{{L|Messenger|Oop. Hup. [''helps her walk'']}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess starts walking on her own away from the messenger.'']}}
{{L|Messenger|Ah! [''catches up to her and picks her up''] Aw. [''makes baby noises''] [''tickles her face'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''giggles''] [''her flames intensify'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to the messenger handing Flame Princess to [[Rock Woodsman]].'']}}
{{L|Messenger|[''sighs''] Hmm. [''starts crying and runs off'']}}
{{L|Rock Woodsman|Ho-ho! [''puts Flame Princess down and starts sawing wood'']}}
{{L|[''Flame Princess walks into the lumberjack's house and sets it on fire.'']}}
{{L|Rock Woodsman|[''gasps''] WAAAAAAAAAH!}}
{{L|Flame Princess|[''laughs''] [''runs into the forest, burning trees''] Bah. [''knocks down a tree, behind which can be seen the [[Candy Kingdom]] in the distance''] Ca'tle.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|[''looking through a telescope''] What's this?}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Princess Bubblegum in a fireproof suit walking up to Flame Princess.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Kih, kih.}}
{{L|[''Princess Bubblegum picks her up.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|A princess? Must've wandered off.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Fire Kingdom.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Flame King?}}
{{L|Flame King|What do you want, princess of the Gum World?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|I found your lost daughter.}}
{{L|Flame King|I-I don't remember losing anything.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Pssh.}}
{{L|Flame King|Okay, you got me. I had her sent to wander in the woods. I was in fear of being usurped. Come on.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|That's your problem, but you can't just let her run around the woods. She's too dangerous. Find some way to contain her power, or I will.}}
{{L|Flame King|Pssh, fine.}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to baby Flame Princess in the [[lantern]].'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts back to Flame Princess in Cinnamon Bun's house.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess|[''stands up''] [''groans in frustration''] Is everybody in this world hiding something?}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|It's fun to hide.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|You're all right. Why can't everybody be honest like you? Maybe I should just go back where I belong.}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|Wait, do you mean baby jail?}}
{{L|Flame Princess|I don't know, man.}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|Mmmm...}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Finn and Princess Bubblegum walking up to a metal door.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Fighting snow-a-constrictors really helped take my mind off things.}}
{{L|[''Finn shakes snow off his head as Princess Bubblegum pushes buttons on a keypad next to the door.'']}}
{{L|Finn|So, uh, why am I here again?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Oh, I just wanted to measure Flame Princess's reaction when confronted by the guy who broke her heart.}}
{{L|[''Finn frowns, and the door opens.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Hey, Cinnamon Bun, I'm—[''gasps'']}}
{{L|[''The metal contraption is out of control, frantically moving up and down and smoking.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|CINNAMON BUN!!!}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Cinnamon Bun's house. Finn and Princess Bubblegum arrive via carriage and walk up to the door.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|There's a note [''reading it''] "Gon 2 fyr kingdum. Pleez watch dog."}}
{{L|[''Cinnamon Bun's "dog" is on the doorstep next to a bowl of dog food.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Oh, this is terrible! If Flame Princess goes back there, her evil dad will lock her up again!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| And if she's imprisoned, I won't be able to complete my tests, and I'll have wasted my precious time!}}
{{L|Finn|We gotta save her. Let's doogie!}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Fire Kingdom. Finn and Princess Bubblegum, dressed in fireproof suits, walk up to a couple [[Flame Guard]]s.'']}}
{{L|Flame Guard #1|State your business here, and be quick about it. Sorry, I'm on edge 'cause I'm worried that Jerry here will find out I'm dating his sister.}}
{{L|[''Jerry turns his head.'']}}
{{L|Finn|Listen, we need to get into the castle right now.}}
{{L|Flame Guard #1|Yeah, but why?}}
{{L|Finn|Grrr! So I can go to your mama's house! Now get outta my way!}}
{{L|Jerry|Doesn't your mom live in a nursing home?}}
{{L|Flame Guard #1|Yeah, and in a different city. C'mon, dude, you gotta be honest here.}}
{{L|Finn|Honest my fist! [''punches Flame Guard, pushes him down, and headbutts Jerry''] Come on, Princess!}}
{{L|[''The two run inside but are blasted back by a huge fireball.'']}}
{{L|Flame Guard #2|D'aw, yeah! Gonna scramble you and fry you up for brunch! I try to act tough but I really wanted to be a chef.}}
{{L|Finn|Man.}}
{{L|[''A [[Flame People|Flame Person]] walks up to the three guards.'']}}
{{L|Jerry|Halt. What is your business here?}}
{{L|Flame Person|I need to get inside to file my taxes. Also I like using the bathroom here. Also I like to crop dust the lobby.}}
{{L|Flame Guard #2|Pass, friend.}}
{{L|Finn|Alright, so you wanna get nasty? One time, I blew a snot bubble that broke off and floated away. Then it hit some lady's baby in the face, and it started crying.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|And I really enjoy the taste of envelopes.}}
{{L|Flame Guard #1|Uh, that's cool and all, but you still haven't told us why you want to get in.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|We need to see the king?}}
{{L|Flame Guard #1|Well, why didn't you just say so? Right this way, friends. [''leads them inside''] There you go: [''Flame Princess is seated on the throne wearing royal garb''] the new Flame King.}}
{{L|Finn|Flame Princess?}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Finn?}}
{{L|Finn|You're okay! Um, how's it going?}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Pretty good. Cinnamon Bun and I staged a coup and I overthrew my dad.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Oh-ho, that's why the guards were wigging out.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|That is the new way in the Fire Kingdom. Total honesty is the law of the land—no secrets.}}
{{L|Finn|Oh.}}
{{L|Flame King|[''from inside lantern''] Right, can you believe this nonsense? Once I get outta here, I'm gonna ground you for real. No snacks, no friends, no popular music.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|You never let me have any of those things! You were a selfish king and a bad parent!}}
{{L|Flame King|But I did it for you, honey—for you not to overthrow me like you just did.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|You belong in that lamp! And if you don't settle down, you'll have to answer to Cinnamon Bun!}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|[''wearing a conical fire hat''] Hi.}}
{{L|Finn|Wow. She's even awesomer than I remember.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum|Take off that silly hat. We're going home.}}
{{L|Cinnamon Bun|No. Look, [''pets [[Jake 2]]''] got a real dog now! Hah.}}
{{L|Finn|Flame Princess, listen. I'm really sorry I lied and hurt your feelings, and I was a big fat jerk—}}
{{L|Flame Princess|Finn, it's okay. It's in the past now.}}
{{L|Finn|So, does that mean we're still going out?}}
{{L|Flame Princess|No. I've realized my place is here, ruling these weak and vicious Fire People.}}
{{L|Finn|I see. [''gets on the ground and goes into fetal position'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess|But we're cool. You're welcome to come back and hang out whenever you like if you promise me one thing.}}
{{L|Finn|[''stands up''] Anything.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|That you'll be completely honest with me.}}
{{L|Finn|Heh. Okay. I promise.}}
{{L|Flame Princess|[''laughs lightly''] I'm serious.}}
{{L|Finn|Hmm.}}
