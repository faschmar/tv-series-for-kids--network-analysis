{{L|Jake| Ready?}}
{{L|Flame Princess| Yes}}
{{L|Jake| [''Sounds of concentration''] [''Then farts''] [''Seals Squeez-E-Mart bag like a balloon.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''Shoots the balloon with her fire''] [''Balloon explodes'']}}
{{L|Finn| That was awesome! Alright, alright, my turn. [''Lies on Jake's back''] [''Sounds of concentration''] [''Then burps''] [''Seals [[Squeez-E-Mart]] bag like a balloon.'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''Focuses on balloon and shoots the balloon''] [''Balloon explodes'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Laughter'']}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''Laughter''] You guys are full of magic air.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Gasps''] [''Farts'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Disgusted''] Gross! [''Rolls with Jake''] [''Then slaps Jake''] No! [''Turns to Flame Princess''] Princess? You, okay?}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''Looks downed''] Yeah... It's just the air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad. [''Looks at Finn and Jake''] I left all my [[Flame Princess' scented candles|scented candles]] at the [[Fire Palace|castle]]. They'd really cut through the magic stink.}}
{{L|Jake| Just go back to the [[Fire Kingdom]] and get 'em. Problem solved.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''Sighs''] [''Then stands up''] Then I'll have to see my [[Flame King|dad]]. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So UNFAIR! [''Flame Princess transforms again to her enraged form.''] [''Screams with anger'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''Frightened'']}}
{{L|Finn| Uh, we can go get 'em.}}
{{L|Flame Princess| [''Returns to her normal form.''] [''Pleasant voice''] Really? That would be really nice. [''Warns''] But don't let my Pops see you. I don't want "His Majesty" thinking I need anything from him.}}
{{L|Flambo| [''Farts'']}}
{{L|Finn, Flame Princess, & Jake| [''Surprised'']}}
{{L|Jake| That ain't me.}}
{{L|Finn, Flame Princess, & Jake| [''Looks at the rock'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| Whoa!}}
{{L|[[Flambo]]| [''inside the rock''] [''Farts more'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''Approaches the rock'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Opens the rock'']}}
{{L|Flambo| Oh! [''Farts again'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Relieved'']}}
{{L|Jake| Flambo! [''Whispers to Finn''] For a second, I thought the princess was farting.}}
{{L|Finn| Flambo, we need you to cast [[Flame Powers|Flame Shield]] on us.}}
{{L|Flambo| [''Agrees to Finn''] Alright! [''Rubs both of his hands''] [''Flambo casting the Flame Shield; chants and also creates a series of runic symbols. He grows two big fists and hits Finn and Jake on the forehead.'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to the Fire Kingdom'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Stretches his left arm to hold onto something with Finn holding onto his back, sneaking pass the Flame Guards.'']}}
{{L|[''Seconds later, inside Flame Princess's room in the palace'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''Tip toe walking towards near the scented candles.'']}}
{{L|Finn| These candles, must be "They."}}
{{L|Jake| [''Sniffing the candles''] [''Whispers''] They smell like an old lady's bathroom.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Whispers with anger''] Hey! Don't disrespect my lady!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Whispers in reply''] I said that as a compliment. Like, it reminds me of grandma. I love my grandma.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Takes the candles and puts them into his backpack.'']}}
{{L|[''Seconds later, two voices are heard behind the door.'']}}
{{L|[[Furnius]]| No one comes-sss here. Not since Flame Princess [''Finn jumps and lies close to the bottom of the door.''] leaved [''for left''] the castle. Now guesssss what we're gonna kill Flame King with?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Gasps''] [''Then whispers''] A conspirator with a hiss voice!}}
{{L|[[Torcho]]| How about, water?}}
{{L|Furnius| Even worsssse, we'll use icccce.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Whispers''] And a conspirator with an untied shoe.}}
{{L|Torcho| Ice? Why ice?}}
{{L|Furnius| Cuz it'sss more painful, You sssimpleton! Cold as iccce fallzz. A perfect death for the Flame King.}}
{{L|Furnius & Torcho| [''Evil laughter'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Gasps, turns around, and Jake is thrown away.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa!}}
{{L|Finn| Did you hear that?}}
{{L|Jake| [''Sniffs'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, come on! We gotta stop those guys from killing Flame Princess's dad!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Drops the candle''] Right, right.}}
{{L|[''Moments later, outside the room'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Opens the door'']}}
{{L|Finn| Dirt bags! Where'd they go?}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''Tip toe walking'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Gasps'']}}
{{L|[''Lesser Flame Guards approaching nearby'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''Plans via body language''] [''Then disguises themselves as a painting'']}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guards| [''Walking backwards'']}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guard 1| [''Notices''] Hey, is that new?}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guard 2| Yeah, I think it is.}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guard 3| Yes it is new.}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guard 2| Hm, what you guys think about this painting?}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guard 1| I like it.}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guard 3| Hey, is this one of those paintings where the eyes follow you.}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guards| [''Looks at the painting'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Concentrating'']}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guards| [''Moves to the right and left while looking at them.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Still concentrating'']}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guard 1| Hmmm}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guard 2| [''Sighs'']}}
{{L|Lesser Flame Guards| [''Moves to the right''] [''Gets bored'']}}

{{L|Finn & Jake| [''Breaths'']}}
{{L|Jake| Now what?}}
{{L|Furnius| And most of actual murdersss...}}
{{L|Finn| [''Whispers''] You hear that? It sounds like a voice with a hiss.}}
{{L|Jake| The kind we are looking for.}}
{{L|Furnius| The ssserpent that isss...}}
{{L|Finn| Stop!}}
{{L|Furnius| ...my father's life, now wears his crown. [''Hisses'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''Looks above'']}}
{{L|Jake| Dude, the voice}}
{{L|Finn| We must follow the voice}}
{{L|Jake| [''Opens the air vent''] [''Uses his stretchy powers to get there and pulls Finn up.''] [''Then closes the air vent'']}}
{{L|Unknown| To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream...}}
{{L|Finn| [''Whispers''] Which way is the hiss voice coming from?}}
{{L|Unknown| ...there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what...}}
{{L|Jake| [''Whispers''] This way!}}
{{L|Unknown| ...dreams may come.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Drags self'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Whispers''] Which way?}}

{{L|Jake| [''Checking out'']}}
{{L|Fire Denizens 1| [''Pointing with their right finger at each other''] You! You! You!}}

{{L|Jake| [''Whispers''] I don't think it's them.}}
{{L|Fire Denizens 2| Double you! Double you!}}

{{L|Red snake| [''Hisses'']}}
{{L|Jalapeño pepper| ....snake on your shoulder.}}

{{L|Finn| [''Lays a hand on a theater troupe member''] What's going with the costumes?}}
{{L|Theater troupe member| [''High voice''] This is a theater troupe. We're getting rrready to perform for the king. Everyone in the kingdom shall be in attendance. [''Lowered voice''] Of course, you know all this being fellow actors from the exact same troupe. [''Turns around and picks clothes'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Makes a distance with Finn''] I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Likes it''] That's brilliant!}}
{{L|Jake| Thanks! It's an original idea, by me.}}
{{L|[''Moments later, at the stage play, Flame King appears and the lights went low for the play.'']}}

{{L|Jake| Water, man. Enough of it to put out the King's fire.}}
{{L|Suspect| [''Still moaning''] [''Then eats a hot dog''] [''Looking around with suspicion'']}}
{{L|Finn| I thinks he's starting to crack. Water? You know what is more painful, if we pour ice in his ear. That's how we'll kill the Flame King.}}
{{L|Flame King| [''Bored''] Psh, kill the Flame King? [''Thinks about it''] [''Then behind him, an arm appeared, holding ice and fails to pour on him.''] [''Angry reaction''] This is treason disguised as a play! [''Orders''] Guards, seized them!}}

{{L|Flame King| [''Performs a stunt towards the stage'']}}
{{L|Flame King| [''Yes tone''] All evil.}}
{{L|Finn| Then, is Flame Princess: evil or maybe chaotic neutral?}}
{{L|Flame King| She's evil.}}
{{L|Finn| Okay, so your daughter's evil. We've established that, but do you think if a good guy really liked her, could he, change her to good?}}
{{L|Flame King| Hmmmmm, well, there'd be penalties to her experience, if she acted out of alignment. But, yes, someone could change her.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Smiles happily'']}}
{{L|Finn & Jake| [''Leaves the stage'']}}
{{L|Flame King| [''Thinks about his daughter''] Change her to good? [''Worried'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts to Flame Princess's house'']}}
