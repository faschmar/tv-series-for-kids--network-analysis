{{L|[''Finn and Rag Wizard are riding on Jake's shoulders, Jake is running'']}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| Faster!}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| Faster! She's in danger!}}
{{L|[[Jake]]| Who is he talking about?}}
{{L|[[Finn]]| I have no idea.}}
{{L|Jake| What?! Then why am I running so hard?}}
{{L|Finn| Because...}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| Because she's in trouble!}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Who is?!}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| [[Marceline]]!}}
{{L|Finn| Faster, Jake!}}
{{L|Jake| She's in trouble! [''runs faster'']}}
{{L|Jake| Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline?}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| I'm her spirit animal.}}
{{L|Jake| Oh.}}
{{L|[''They arrive at [[Marceline's house]], Marceline lying on her floor'']}}
{{L|Finn|[''gasp''] Marceline! What's wrong with her?}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber.}}
{{L|Finn| Tell us how to break the spell.}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| I'll transport you into Marceline's mind where you will walk through her memories and find the memory core.}}
{{L|Jake| Then what?}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself. At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality.}}
{{L|Jake| But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself?}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms. Just legs. [''stretches leg towards Finn''] Yeah, there we go... oh. [''jabs Finn's forehead with toe'']}}
{{L|Finn| What? What'd you do to my forehead?}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here, take this. [''gives Finn a sack''] It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake walk over to the couch and sits on it'']}}
{{L|Finn| Like this? [''sprinkles powder on himself and Jake'']}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| Yep, like that. Feel sleepy?}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Mmhm.}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| Good. Sleep now. But know this! If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep... forever!}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| [''gasp'']}}
{{L|Rag Wizard| And ever. And ever.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake fall into darkness, sleeping. Lights come on'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''yawns''] Did it work?}}
{{L|Finn: [''rubs eyes''] Ugh, ah. I can't tell. I don't ''feel'' like I'm inside Marceline's memories.}}
{{L|Jake| Me neither. Huh?}}
{{L|[''They walk beside the couch, which extends into a destroyed town-like area'']}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa. Whoa!}}
{{L|Finn| So... if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline?}}
{{L|Jake| Hmm... there she is! [''walks up to young Marceline''] Hey, little Marcy.}}
{{L|Young Marceline| Who are you guys?}}
{{L|Finn| We're Finn and Jake.}}
{{L|Jake| We're your friends!}}
{{L|Young Marceline| [[Hambo]] is my only friend. See? [''holds up Hambo''] You need another eyeball surgery, pal. Lucky for you, we found a donor. [''rips button from shirt''] Eyeball! Nurse, hand me the string. Yes, doctor. It's our last piece. Hold still. [''stitches button into Hambo''] I'm hurting you because I love you.}}
{{L|Jake| Ahem!}}
{{L|Young Marceline| What are ''you'' guys still doing here?}}
{{L|Finn| We're trying to wake you up.}}
{{L|Jake| Do you know where your memory core is?}}
{{L|Young Marceline| Nope, but there might be anything behind that cellar door, and it rhymes with memory core!}}
{{L|Jake| Ooo! Ooo! Could be jams and pickles down there!  [''opens door''] Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it! Ooo, ice cream}}
{{L|Finn| I want some! Huh? [''Finn and Jake enter Marceline's room while she is picking her nose'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''opens new door''] Come on, Finn!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake enter a broken down restaurant, Hunson Abadeer is eating Marceline's fries'']}}
{{L|Finn| Yo, man.}}
{{L|[[Hunson Abadeer]]| Wha?}}
{{L|Finn: Don't eat those.}}
{{L|[''Teenage Marceline walks in, seeing her dad eating her fries'']}}
{{L|Hunson Abadeer|Marceline!}}
{{L|Teenage Marceline| [''sniffling''] Daddy, why?''}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake enter a new memory located in the [[Tree Fort]]'']}}
{{L|Finn| It's our treehouse. This must be when Marceline lived here.}}
{{L|[''A slightly younger Marceline and Ash carry and put down chair in the room They fall on the chair'']}}
{{L|Marceline| I'm so glad we're doing this, [[Ash]].}}
{{L|Ash| Yeah, me too. Oh, hey, wait. Watch this--I've been practicing. [''summons rose'']}}
{{L|Rose| Marceline! I love, I love.}}
{{L|[''Marceline kisses Ash on the cheek; rose continues to say "I love"'']}}
{{L|Ash| [''giggles'']}}
{{L|Jake| Who's this guy supposed to be?}}
{{L|Finn| Ash, I guess.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake enter a new room through a mouse hole to see Marceline sitting in a chair'']}}
{{L|Marceline| [''sighs'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''sniffs''] This place reeks.}}
{{L|Jake| Yo, man, your thing is glowing.}}
{{L|Finn| My what? [''touches forehead''] Oh, my thing.}}
{{L|Jake| We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on.}}
{{L|Finn| Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again.}}
{{L|Ash| Hey, open your eyes, look at this, Mar-Mar. Check it out. It's my new wand. [''holds a flower with four cherry blossoms''] These cherry blossoms, look, look as close as you can, and they're real.}}
{{L|Marceline| [''puts a finger near a cherry blossom and gets zapped''] Wow. Awesome. Where'd you get the money for that thing?}}
{{L|Ash|Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a [[Maja|Witch]].}}
{{L|Marceline| You what? Are you crazy? That was my favorite thing in the whole world!}}
{{L|Ash| That's why it's so valuable, genius--for potions.}}
{{L|[''A ghost comes out of the wand'']}}
{{L|[[Cherry Blossom Ghost]]| You're not, a genius. You're not, a genius.}}
{{L|Marceline|[''crying''] That's the last straw, Ash! That's it! You're a psycho jerk, and you ruined my life.}}
{{L|Ash| But--but not all of it!}}
{{L|Marceline| '''''IT'S OVER, YOU PSYCHO!!''''' [''stomps out of the room'']}}
{{L|Jake|This way, Finn! Check out this whacked out memory crack! It's ba-nay-nay down here!}}
{{L|[''They enter Marceline's memory core'']}}
{{L|Finn| The core!}}
{{L|Jake| All these orbs must be her memories.}}
{{L|Finn| How are we supposed to know which one to grab?}}
{{L|Jake| Play hot-cold with your forehead!}}
{{L|Finn| Alright. [''moves along the memory core''] Hot or cold?}}
{{L|Jake| Cold. Definitely cold.}}
{{L|[''Finn continues moving'']}}
{{L|Jake| Warmer. Warmer, warmer! Whoa, hot. Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one!}}
{{L|[''Finn grabs memory'']}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake wake up with the memory orb in their hand; it gets grabbed by Rag Wizard, who has arms now'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''wakes up''] Huh? Hey, you have arms.}}
{{L|Ash| That's right, genius.}}
{{L|Jake| Huh?}}
{{L|Finn: You lied to us.}}
{{L|Ash| The important thing is... Marceline's awake. [''magically beams Marceline awake'']}}
{{L|[''Marceline wakes up'']}}
{{L|Finn| Marcie, Marcie! You're okay.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake rub Marceline's hair, Rag Wizard takes off his wardrobe revealing himself to be Ash'']}}
{{L|Marceline| Quit touching my hair!}}
{{L|Finn| You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend.}}
{{L|Marceline| That's Ash.}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Ash?}}
{{L|Marceline| He's not my friend; he's my ''boyfriend''.}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| What?!}}
{{L|Ash| That's right, babe.}}
{{L|Marceline| Ash, what's going on?}}
{{L|Ash| Just picking up my girl for a night on the town; at my place.}}
{{L|Marceline| That's sweet. [''kisses Ash on the cheek'']}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| What?!}}
{{L|Marceline| Oh, grow up you guys. I'm going to go freshen up.}}
{{L|Ash| That's a relief.}}
{{L|Marceline| Oh, Ash.}}
{{L|Finn| What?}}
{{L|Ash| Don't you guys get it? I outbrained you. That wasn't the memory of a sleep spell you brought me. That memory was our break-up!}}
{{L|Marceline| [''in memory orb''] ''It's over, you psycho!!'' [''orb is popped by Ash'']}}
{{L|Ash| That's enough of that?}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, no!}}
{{L|Finn| What?}}
{{L|Ash| Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar, let's go.}}
{{L|Finn| No, Marceline!}}
{{L|Ash| Ashicus Flyicus. [''flies away with Marceline'']}}
{{L|Finn| They're gone, man. He took her!}}
{{L|Jake| Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent. [''sniffs''] Ah. Follow me.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake arrive at Ash's house'']}}
{{L|Jake| I could smell them in there. So what's the plan?}}
{{L|Finn| Um. Okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed until Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline.}}
{{L|Jake| [''fist bumps Finn''] Nice. [''bangs shovel against shed and [[Tiny Goblin]] comes out'']}}
{{L|Tiny Goblin| My house! What's happening? No, don't hurt me!}}
{{L|Jake| No, no, sorry.}}
{{L|Tiny Goblin: [''screams'']}}
{{L|Jake| Shh, shh, wait!}}
{{L|Tiny Goblin| Help, somebody help me!}}
{{L|Ash| [''bursting out his front door''] What's all this hullabaloo?!}}
{{L|Tiny Goblin: Help! Help!}}
{{L|Ash| Hey, hold it, you, get back here! [''chases after Jake'']}}
{{L|[''Finn arrives through the house's chimney'']}}
{{L|Marceline| Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here! Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals.}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, okay. Sorry Marceline, I'll go. I just gotta show you something first.[''shows Marceline sack of magic powder'']}}
{{L|[''The powder puffs into a big cloud and they are transported to Finn's memories'']}}
{{L|Marceline| Hello? Finn?}}
{{L|[''Marceline opens a door to see a baby Finn singing [[Baby Finn Song]]. She stops watching and starts laughing, Finn shows up'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, there you are. [''closes door'']}}
{{L|Marceline| Finn, what's going on? What is this place?}}
{{L|Finn| It's my old house. That magic powder--it put you in my memories. Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of you breaking up with him. But it's okay because I saw the memory. Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See? [''holds memory orb to Marceline'']}}
{{L|Ash| [''memory orb''] Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a witch.}}
{{L|Marceline|[''in memory orb''] '''''It's over, you psycho!!'''''}}
{{L|Marceline| Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now.}}
{{L|[''Finn and Marceline exit his memories and are walking out of Ash's house'']}}
{{L|Finn| You gonna be okay, Marceline?}}
{{L|Marceline| Yeah. Thanks, Finn, I...}}
{{L|Ash| Yo, Mar-Mar. What—What's with the chump? C'mon, I said no chumps. [''pats his belly''] Ash gets hungies at eight o' clock. You need to get back in the kitchen and make me din-ner.}}
{{L|Marceline| [''angrily grunts with a scowl'']}}
{{L|Ash| I want a turkey sandwich with to-ma-to.}}
{{L|Marceline|[''grunts once more'']}}
{{L|Ash| Also pickles.}}
{{L|[''Steaming, Marceline kicks Ash in the crotch, Ash groans in pain. Ash falls down, and Marceline continues to kick him. Finn starts jumping on Ash.'']}}
{{L|Ash|[''groaning''] Ohh...I can't see...Somebody call my mom!}}
{{L|[''They back off, and Jake stomps on Ash with a giant foot. The episode ends.'']}}
