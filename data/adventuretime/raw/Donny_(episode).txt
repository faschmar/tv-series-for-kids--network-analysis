{{L|[''The episode begins with [[Finn]] and [[Jake]] in tall grass.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Safety! [''Jumping out''] Patrol!}}
{{L|Jake| Safety! [''Jumping out''] Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety— Oh... Were we not wearing the uniforms?}}
{{L|Finn| C'mon. Let's keep lookin' for hazards. Look out!}}
{{L|Jake| What is it, dude?}}
{{L|Finn| Shushers, man! [''Pointing at village''] Look there!}}
{{L|Jake| Just looks like an ordinary little town, man.}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah... [''Puts on binoculars''] Suspiciously ordinary. Oh! Little [[House People|house people]]! Maybe it is just regular ordinary, not sinister ordinary—oh, no, wait... Grass ogre.}}
{{L|[[Donny (character)|Donny]]| Haha! [''Putting chicken in mailbox''] Hey, chicken, you're travelin' egg-spress! [''Laughs'']}}
{{L|Finn| It's an obnoxious grass ogre.}}
{{L|Donny| You get my joke, right?! Hahaha!}}
{{L|Barn House| Careful, you oaf! Those chickens are rentals! [''Donny fires an egg at him.''] Agh!}}
{{L|Donny| [''Firing eggs''] We're havin' so much fun, huh?!}}
{{L|Jail House| Drop that chicken!}}
{{L|Donny| [''Stopping''] Huh?}}
{{L|Jail House| You're under arrest! [''Donny comes over and drops the chicken.''] Good... Now get in your tiny cell... Oh, uh, oh!}}
{{L|[''Donny picks up the Jail House Person and lays him down on his back. Donny laughs.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, ogre! Stop hazing these cute little houses!}}
{{L|Jake| Ya jerkball!}}
{{L|Donny| My name is Donny, idiot!}}
{{L|Finn| Sorry. I was just tryina' get your attention.}}
{{L|Donny| What kinda houses are you supposed to be? A... stupid... uh... a dumb house?! Haha! Hey, what's with your jowl?! [''Flicks Jake's jowl'']}}
{{L|Jake| Ow!}}
{{L|Donny| Hahaha! I'm gonna mess with these housies some more.}}
{{L|Finn| NEVER!!}}
{{L|[''Finn runs up to Donny and jumps on his back, attempting to stop him.'']}}
{{L|Donny| So you wanna wrestle, huh? 'Cause I know, like, this ninja move to get out of this lock instantly! Okay... Now, first I... [''Finn squeezes Donny.''] Hey! You're doin' it wrong!!}}
{{L|[''Jake wiggles his finger and stretches one of them out.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''To himself''] Whoa.}}
{{L|Finn| You're doin' it wrong!}}
{{L|Donny| Whaddaya mean?}}
{{L|Finn| First, you roll your right shoulder forward...}}
{{L|[''Donny picks Finn up'']}}
{{L|Donny| Like this?}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, but then I counter it by doin' this! [''He grabs Donny again and squeezes.'']}}
{{L|Donny| Hey!}}
{{L|[''Donny begins to pant heavily.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Um... You need to take a break?}}
{{L|Donny| No... but if you need to, we can stop... [''Finn gets off''] Ya baby.}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa, I zoned out there for a bit. Did you win?}}
{{L|Finn| Nah. Just takin' five. Donny's pretty good.}}
{{L|Donny| Yeah, well, you're okay, too.}}
{{L|Finn| Thanks, man.}}
{{L|Donny| ...For a complete idiot!}}
{{L|Finn| Aww...}}
{{L|[''Donny laughs'']}}
{{L|Jake| Donald, quit all this jerky nonsense! [''Forms giant, tree-like ears''] Unless you wanna get gored by a forest prince!}}
{{L|Donny| I was just kiddin' around, but then you took it too far! You guys are the real jerks! [''Donny mumbles, scoffs, and runs off.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Donny is one mixed-up dude.}}
{{L|Finn| Nah. He's just rough-and-tumble, like me, but deep down, he's probably really sensitive, like me.}}
{{L|Jake| You're a mixed-up dude, too!}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, Donny!}}
{{L|Donny| What?}}
{{L|Finn| I was thinkin' that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd wanna hang out with a couple a' rascals like me and Jake!}}
{{L|Jake| What?}}
{{L|Donny| Muuuh... I don't know. Messin' with these housies is pretty fun. You got somethin' better?}}
{{L|Jake| [''To Finn''] You sure this is a good idea?}}
{{L|Finn| [''To Donny''] If you come to the Tree Fort, we got video games and apple juice!}}
{{L|Donny| [''Eager''] Really?! [''Pulling back, pretending not to care''] I mean... if it keeps you from cryin'...}}
{{L|Finn| [''To Jake''] Donny's problem is that he's treated like an outsider, like me.}}
{{L|Jake| You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts!}}
{{L|Finn| I... am complicated.}}
{{L|[''Scene transition; the three are at the Tree Fort.'']}}
{{L|Donny| Uh... This fort isn't so great. Not as cool as the fort I'm gonna build. [''Sitting down''] I call this chair!}}
{{L|Finn| Hey, Donny, you should play Bug Battle.}}
{{L|Jake| [''Putting game in BMO''] And hey, can you put on some pants?!}}
{{L|Donny| You put on some pants!}}
{{L|Jake| I have pants... [''Grabs transparent pants''] spun from spiderwebs... by pixies.}}
{{L|[''The game starts.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''To Donny''] Okay. There's you, and here come the bugs.}}
{{L|[''Donny destroys the bugs in the game. Donny starts laughing. Suddenly, a spider drops from above and kills the video game character.'']}}
{{L|Donny| Huh?!}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, yeah. Those guys'll get ya.}}
{{L|Donny| [''Breaking controller''] Urgh!! This game cheats! [''Throws controller parts at BMO, knocking it down'']}}
{{L|Jake| Not cool, dude.}}
{{L|Finn| Have more apple juice. It always makes me feel better when I— [''Donny splashes the apple juice in Finn's face.''] Aaah! Donny! Quit being a jerk!}}
{{L|Donny| What? What'd I do?}}
{{L|Jake| Finn, I don't think this is gonna work.}}
{{L|BMO| I am incapable of all emotion.... but you are making me chafed!!}}
{{L|Donny| Everybody's gettin' mad at me for nothin'!}}
{{L|Finn| You have to think about how your actions make other people feel.}}
{{L|Donny| Ohh. Hmm. I don't understand at all.}}
{{L|Jake| Ooh! Teach him that little empathy song I taught you!}}
{{L|Finn| Okay, yeah! [''Singing''] Empathy, empathy, put yourself in the place of me! [''Speaking''] Your turn!}}
{{L|Donny| Uh... Empathy, empathy, put yourself... Ohh! So it's like, when I squeeze eggs outta chickens, I should let them squeeze eggs outta me, too!}}
{{L|Finn| ...Um... kinda right. [''Screams are heard.''] Someone needs our help! Jake, you stay here and try to fix him, while I deal with an unknown possibly deadly emergency! [''Runs off'']}}
{{L|Jake| Dude, trade me jobs.}}
{{L|[''A loud crash is heard.'']}}
{{L|Donny| Jake! Someone broke your... um... entire living room!}}
{{L|[''Jake slaps his hand against his face. The scene changes to the house "village" where werewolves are terrorizing the House People.'']}}
{{L|Bank House| Quick! Act abandoned!}}
{{L|[''He and the Girl With Glasses House do so. The wolf growls at the Dog House, and Finn punches him.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hands off the housing market! [''The wolf attacks Finn.''] BACKPACK! [''Finn blocks the wolf's attack with his pack.''] Werewolves. Much worse than ogres. [''Runs'']}}
{{L|Jail House| Stop in the name of the law!}}
{{L|[''Finn grabs the Jail House and keeps running.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Is there somewhere I can trap that thing?}}
{{L|Jail House| Well, there was a zoo, but he moved back east. Course, there's always the old well.}}
{{L|Well| I'm not old!}}
{{L|Finn| Perfect! [''Finn leads the wolf up to the well and kicks it down.''] Slam-bam-in-a-can! Huh? Another werewolf?!? What's up with this town?!}}
{{L|[''A Siamese twin wolf bites attacks the bank house. Finn forces the wolf into the well with another House Person.}}
{{L|Finn| Mr. Bank! Are you alright?!}}
{{L|Bank House| Oh, it's fine, it's fine. All my assets are insured. Pardon. [''Leaving''] I have to go spackle my cracks.}}
{{L|Finn| [''To himself''] Why is this town just getting worse and worse?}}
{{L|Wolf| [''From inside old well''] Yes! Why indeed!!}}
{{L|Finn| [''To werewolf''] Hey! What are you werewolves up to?!}}
{{L|Wolf| We're not werewolves... [''The wolf reveals a suit he's wearing.''] [''Calmer common voice''] We're [[Why-wolves]].}}
{{L|Finn| Uh... Why-wolves?}}
{{L|Why-wolf| Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry..... [''Growling voice''] AND... BLOODLUST!!}}
{{L|Finn| What?!}}
{{L|Why-wolf| [''Normal voice''] Please. Save your questions until the end of the lecture. [''Demonstrating by drawing on dirt''] Our ecosystem. At the bottom level are the house people. Given the opportunity, we Why-wolves would easily wipe them out. However, Donny's presence is a natural deterrent. His jerkiness is so powerful that it produces a pungent gas—[[obnoxygen]]. To Why-wolves, it is a deadly poison. But since you've removed the jerk Donny, we will devour the houses, and our population will rapidly swell until we are, in turn, devoured by the [[Cosmic Owl]]. Such is the course of nature, but it'll be a pretty sweet ride up until that point. [''Growling voice''] TONIGHT, WE FEAST ON THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS! [''He howls. The Siamese twin Why-wolf laughs maliciously.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, no! I have to get Donny back!}}
{{L|[''Scene shifts back to the Tree Fort. Finn barges in.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Talking quickly''] Donny, you have to go right now, and stop the Why-wolves from—}}
{{L|[''Donny is playing a cello and Jake his viola.'']}}
{{L|Donny| [''Pleasantly''] Ah! Master Finn has returned!}}
{{L|Finn| What's it goin'?!}}
{{L|Donny| Thanks to you, I shall never be jerky again!}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, no... Oh, no. Oh, no, nonononononono! No! This is all wrong! We need jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen, and, and—}}
{{L|Donny| Steady on, Finn. Perhaps you are dehydrated! It's as Jake taught me: [''Singing''] "8 ounces, 8 glasses, 8 days a week!" [''Speaking''] I'll fetch you some tap water.}}
{{L|Finn| Are you wearing jeans now?!}}
{{L|Donny| Surely! [''Singing''] Gotta get pants! Go get your pants! Button, fly! I wrote that one myself. Perdoname. [''Leaves'']}}
{{L|Finn| But, but, but—}}
{{L|Jake| Butt, butt, butt! Yeah, Donny! You're lookin' good in those jeans!}}
{{L|Finn| What did you do?!}}
{{L|Jake| Miraculous, isn't it? I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect.}}
{{L|Finn| No! We messed up, Jake! The House People are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk!}}
{{L|Donny| [''Clears throat''] I have no intention of being a jerk again. Hmph.}}
{{L|Finn| But the housies will be wiped out if you don't!}}
{{L|Donny| It sounds tragic, but I'm turning over a new leaf! [''Literally does so'']}}
{{L|Finn| Donny, you gotta go!}}
{{L|Donny| Finn, "no" means, "no." I'm sure you'll respect my wishes. [''Cut to Finn and Jake forcefully dragging Donny to the village''] No! Stop! No!}}
{{L|Finn| Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves!}}
{{L|Donny| No! I'll use my musical messages to stop them! [''Finn and Jake hang their mouths open, not believing what they are hearing.''] Let's see... I've got one on the ethics of laundry... Crosswalk-ery... Ooh! Here's a good one!}}
{{L|Finn| Man! The town is getting creamed! By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny!!}}
{{L|Donny| [''Singing''] Comb your hair right! It's a good time! Sticky, sticky pomades, short back and sides! [''No one responds''] [''Speaking''] Why isn't anybody paying attention to my words?}}
{{L|Finn| [''To Jake''] He sure is sensitive about his songs! [''Gasps''] [''To Donny''] It's cuz they think your songs are dumb!}}
{{L|Donny| Wha?!}}
{{L|Jake| [''To Finn''] What're you saying?! If you don't encourage his talent, he might revert back to jerk Do— [''In realization''] OHHH, OHHH! [''To Donny''] HEY, DONNY! EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!!}}
{{L|Finn| They all think you're a real jerk!}}
{{L|Donny| But... but I've changed! Why would they say that?! [''Singing weakly''] Empathy, empathy, put your mind insi...}}
{{L|[''The Why-wolves and House People laugh at him.'']}}
{{L|Why-wolf| You're so pathetic! So comical!}}
{{L|[''The Bank House laughs at him.'']}}
{{L|Donny| [''Getting angry''] Rrrrr... Think I'm a jerk do they? I'm feelin'.. obnoxious!! [''He rips out of his clothes in rage.''] HEY, YOU WHY-WOLVES ARE COOL! JUST KIDDING! [''Releasing obnoxygen''] HAHAHAHA!!}}
{{L|Why-wolf| Obnoxygen cloud!! EGRESS!!}}
{{L|[''The Why-wolves run away howling. Donny pants heavily.'']}}
{{L|House People| The town is saved!!}}
{{L|[''The housies gather around Donny in celebration.'']}}
{{L|Donny| Get offa' me, nerds!!}}
{{L|Finn| You did it, Donny! You're a full-blown jerk again!}}
{{L|Donny| What?! You're the jerk!! Housies! Ready to hear my new song?! It's about how Finn will betray you, just to save lives!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Gravely''] I'm sorry, Donny.}}
{{L|Donny| I'll never forgive you, Finn!! [''Angrily spraying House People with eggs''] WAAAAAAH!!!}}
{{L|Jake| [''To Finn''] C'mon. We can go stare wistfully at the lake.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Tired''] I'd... I'd like that. Very much.}}
{{L|[''Donny continues pelting the housies with eggs, laughing.'']}}
{{L|Donny| Hey! I love bein' a jerk! Thanks, Finn! Finn? [''The heroes have left.''] Finn, you loser! [''Whispering''] I'll never... forget you!}}
{{L|[''The episode ends with the Adventure Time logo swirling onto the screen.'']}}
