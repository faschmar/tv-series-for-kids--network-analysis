{{L|[''The scene begins at the [[Tree Fort]].'']}}
{{L|[[Jake]]| And as it waded through the carnage that it had wrought, the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it!}}
{{L|[[Finn]]| No way!}}
{{L|Jake| Yes way, it did. And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist.}}
{{L|[''warbling with tongue'']}}
{{L|Finn| Ah, jeez! Jake, is this stuff you're saying true? Or are you just trying to mess me up? You have to be honest.}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, it's true, man. I heard it through a reliable source.}}
{{L|Finn| Reliable? Rats!}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah. Some say it haunted this very tree!}}
{{L|Finn| This tree?!}}
{{L|Jake| [''ominously''] Good niiiight...}}
{{L|Finn| Jake?}}
{{L|[''Jake warbling downstairs'']}}
{{L|Finn| You're full of it, Jake!}}
{{L|[''Jake warbling ominously'']}}
{{L|Finn|Errr... [''he hears croaking and sees a [[worm]] on his bed''] NO WORMS ON THE BED! [''Hits worm with [[The Enchiridion (book)|the Enchiridion]].'']}}
{{L|[''Sees a tree limb tapping on his window, then a mysterious [[Marceline|figure]] taps on the window'']}}
{{L|Finn| Huh? [''Lightning crashes, and the figure's scary face is seen'']}}
{{L|Finn| AAAAAH!!! [''Runs downstairs'']}}
{{L|Finn| Jake! Jake! I saw someone outside the window! It must be the vampire, and I think we're unprepared, so I--}}
{{L|Jake| Relax, buddy. I made that story up. I was just trying to scare you.}}
{{L|Finn| But you said you heard it from a reliable source!}}
{{L|Jake| Ha ha! I made that up, too. I was trying to scare you, and it worked! [''laughs'']}}
{{L|[''the window blows open by itself, the lights go out, and Jake screams'']}}
{{L|Finn| No one's outside.}}
{{L|Jake| Whew!}}
{{L|Finn| It was just the wind, scaredy-cat.}}
{{L|Jake| I wasn't scared, I was singing. I was singing my scream song. Ahh! Ahh! AAaah-uh-aah!}}
{{L|Finn| You're a total wuss, man.}}
{{L|[''a bag drops, there is a vampire on the ceiling that hisses and scares Finn and Jake'']}}
{{L|[[Marceline]]|Hey, guys. What's up? I'm Marceline the Vampire Queen.}}
{{L|Finn| [''afraid''] Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?!}}
{{L|Jake| Don't suck our blood!}}
{{L|Marceline| [''laughing''] Calm down, weenies. I'm not gonna do that. [''Lights candles'']}}
{{L|Finn| Soooo, you don't suck blood?}}
{{L|Marceline| Sometimes, I do. But it's not the blood that I like. It's the color. I eat shades of red.}}
{{L|[''Sucks the red out of a strawberry, and gives it to Finn'']}}
{{L|Marceline| Ugh, I am exhausted. I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo. And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say "like what?"}}
{{L|Finn| Like what?}}
{{L|Marceline| I encountered a school of goldfish beasts. [''A flashback of Marceline riding giant goldfish'']}}
{{L|Marceline| And I fooled around in the [[Fire Kingdom]]. [''A flashback of Marceline hula-hooping in the Fire Kingdom'']}}
{{L|Finn| OOO!}}
{{L|Marceline| Oh, and check these out. [''She has nuts in her hands'']}}
{{L|Finn| Nuts?}}
{{L|Marceline|Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts. [''Squeezes the nuts and they become little creatures. One squirts Finn with ink.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''laughs''] You're wonderful.}}
{{L|Jake| Um, yeah. Thank you for not sucking our blood.}}
{{L|Marceline| You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going.}}
{{L|Finn| What?}}
{{L|Marceline| [''sighs''] Look. [''She uses psychokinesis and moves a picture frame and reveals an "M" carved into the tree''] "M" for "Marceline."}}
{{L|Jake| Aw, man.}}
{{L|Marceline| I carved in this tree years ago. Way before you two rascals started squatting here. [''Flings them out'']}}
{{L|Marceline| But seriously guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me, I mean really great!}}
{{L|[''Shuts the door'']}}
{{L|Marceline| Good night!}}
{{L|Jake| Come on, Finn. Let's get out of here.}}
{{L|Finn| She can't kick us out of our house!}}
{{L|Jake| Finn!}}
{{L|Finn| Get down here, lady, and fight me!}}
{{L|Jake| She's a vampire, dude!}}
{{L|[''Marceline sucks the red out of a crumpet, and throws it onto Finn'']}}
{{L|Finn| I'm gonna kill her.}}
{{L|Jake| Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question!}}
{{L|[''Marceline hisses at them and then walks away, laughing'']}}
{{L|Finn| But, what about our home?}}
{{L|Jake| A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house.}}
{{L|Finn| But I like our home.}}
{{L|Jake| Finn, house-hunting is wild! You've got to try it.}}
{{L|Finn| Really?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, man! It is so nuts!}}
{{L|Finn| You always know what to say.}}
{{L|Jake| Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop!}}
:{{L|Finn|(laughs) Okay. I'm convinced. Let's roll!}}
{{L|Jake| Sweet, things are gonna start going our way. [''Clouds separate to reveal the sun''] Hey, look, see? What'd I tell ya?}}
{{L|[''[[House Hunting Song]] begins'']}}
{{L|Finn| This is weak! I don't even like any of these places. I wanna go home.}}
{{L|Jake| Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means. [''plays viola''] La, la, la... [''singing''] Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue... Home is anywhere, where people care about you...}}
{{L|Finn| I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude! I just wanna go home...}}
{{L|Jake| [''singing''] But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you! [''talking''] With your lucky stars to guide you from above. [''They look up, a star floats around, then poofs and disappears'']}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my... souse.}}
{{L|Jake| I'd rather be dancing with some babes!}}
{{L|Finn| [''laughs''] Shut up, dude!}}
{{L|Jake| Ew... Gross. This place looks gross!}}
{{L|Finn| And abandoned. [''Echoes'']}}
{{L|[''both scream'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''gasps''] Whoa, bro... Wanna just live in here?}}
{{L|Jake| Yes.}}
{{L|♪ "So they cleaned the cave and built a house inside the cave. ♪}}
{{L|Jake| So whaddaya think, man? We did pretty good for ourselves.}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, we did... So, ah, what should we do first with our new digs?}}
{{L|Jake| Let's trash it and throw a party!}}
{{L|Finn| Ah this is it, feelin' good, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' like we did it. I'm feelin', like, completely satisfied. Nothin' else could go wrong, ya know, Jake?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, man.}}
{{L|Finn| Aww, yeah, I know, too.}}
{{L|Marceline| Hey, Finn.}}
{{L|Jake| She's back!}}
{{L|Marceline| Wow, pretty awesome party ya got here.}}

{{L|Marceline| Oh, I just wanna show you somethin'. This cave belongs to me!}}
{{L|Finn| What!?}}
{{L|Marceline| Thanks for fixing the place up for me.}}
{{L|Finn| Y-You can't take our home twice!}}
{{L|Marceline| [''With guitar''] Yes, I caaaannnnnn!}}
{{L|Finn| AAAAAAAHHHH! It's vampire-fighting time!}}
{{L|Jake| Finn! Nooo! Vampires will kill you... remember!?}}
{{L|Finn| But she's taking our home again!}}
{{L|Jake| We're home as long as we're together, bla-bla-bleep-bla-bloop, remember!?}}
{{L|Finn| Oh, yeah. Okay, Marceline, I'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home, and he's way better than all your homes combined!}}
{{L|Marceline| Ya know, you're right. I guess I'll take him too!}}
{{L|Jake| [''yells'']}}
{{L|Finn| What!?}}
{{L|Marceline| I'll bite him a little, maybe turn him into a zombie.}}
{{L|Jake| Nooo!}}
{{L|Finn| Let go of Jake!}}
{{L|Marceline| Make me.}}
{{L|[''Finn slaps Jake out of Marceline's grip'']}}
{{L|Finn| You okay, pal?}}
{{L|Marceline| [''transforming''] No one... makes me... let go... of Jake!}}
{{L|Finn| I'm not scared of you!}}
{{L|Jake| Finn!}}
{{L|Marceline| [''laughs''] You're pathetic, little boy!}}
{{L|Finn| [''grunts''] You're pathetic! [''Spits''] Get ready for an uppercut, you dog!}}
{{L|Marceline| Make me. [''Slaps Finn's butt and laughs''] Bleh-bleh! Blah!}}
{{L|Jake| I've... gotta help my buddy.}}
{{L|Marceline| Your blood is mine!}}
{{L|Jake| [''warbles'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''screaming''] Jake!}}
{{L|Jake| Uh oh.}}
{{L|[''Marceline sucks Jake's blood and throws Jake's remains on the ground; she laughs.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''Screams; runs up to her and punches her in the face'']}}
{{L|Marceline| Ow! That actually hurt, Finn. [''laughs and kisses him on the cheek, making him blush.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Why didn't you just kill me?}}
{{L|Marceline| 'Cuz that was fun! I haven't fought like that in years! Thanks, Finn.}}
{{L|Jake| Finn!}}
{{L|Finn| Aren't you dead?}}
{{L|Jake| Naaah, before she bit me I used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over my thumb, see? [Does so]}}
{{L|Marceline| [''Clears throat''] You two are pretty hardcore. I can appreciate that.}}
{{L|Finn| Soooo so does that mean we can have our old house back?}}
{{L|Marceline| Yeah! Keep it, as a gift from me. Blaeargh!}}
{{L|[''Finn and Jake both run away screaming'']}}
{{L|[''Scene cuts back to the tree fort'']}}
