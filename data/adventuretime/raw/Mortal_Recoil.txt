{{L|[''The episode begins at the Candy Hospital. A crowd is hovering over [[Princess Bubblegum]] as she's pushed on a gurney.'']}}
{{L|[[Nurse Pound Cake]]| What's her condition, [[Dr. Ice Cream]]?}}
{{L|Dr. Ice Cream| She's totally gross over 90% of her body. The other 10% is crazy nasty.}}
{{L|Nurse Pound Cake| Will she make it, Doctor?}}
{{L|Dr. Ice Cream| [''Gravely''] I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake. [''They quickly pull her to the emergency room, a heart monitor bleeps.''] Put sugar on 'er! Two scoops! [''She and Nurse Pound Cake each put two handfuls of sugar on her, but she starts flat-lining.''] We're losing 'er!!}}
{{L|[[Ice King]]| No! Not my number one! Princess, if you die on me, I will never forgive you! I'll be lost—lost in my own emotional labyri—}}
{{L|[[Finn]]| [''Furiously punches him''] YAAAAAH!!}}
{{L|Dr. Ice Cream| Wait, Finn!}}
{{L|Finn| [''Scared''] What!?}}
{{L|Dr. Ice Cream| Her sugar levels are stabilizing.}}
{{L|[''Princess Bubblegum regains her normal body shape. Everyone starts cheering. "Yaaay! She's alright!"'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| [''Drained''] Yes, I'm fine. I just need to rest.}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Crying''] Oh, my wife! Is there anything weird about her? I can't see through these pain tears!}}
{{L|Dr. Ice Cream| She's fine. Why?}}
{{L|Ice King| It's just that... after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen. Something I still don't understand. [''Finn's Root Sword is hurled at Ice King.''] Ooh—AGH! Wait! Listen to me!!}}
{{L|Finn| NO! Just shut your ''mouth'', old man!}}
{{L|Ice King| "Old man?" Heh! What? I'm not old.}}
{{L|[[Jake]]| Uh, yeah, you are, dude.}}
{{L|[''Everyone agrees with Jake. "You are pretty old." "Yes, you are." "You're old."'']}}
{{L|Ice King| Old? I'm... I see. It's all making sense now. Brrrrapapo! [''Blasts window with ice magic, shattering it''] I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess. [''Tearing up''] Nobody in the world.}}
{{L|Finn| [''With rage''] JUST GET ''OUT'' OF HERE!!}}
{{L|Ice King| Peace.}}
{{L|[''He makes a peace sign then exits while waving solemnly. Finn sighs.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Sorry about that, Peebles.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| The ice wizard is a weak fool....}}
{{L|Jake| Huh?}}
{{L|Raggedy Princess| [''Running in''] Finn! Finn! The other princesses and I made you a new [[Finn's pack|backpack]]!}}
{{L|Finn| Whoa, Raggedy Princess! It's so awesome! Thank you.}}
{{L|Raggedy Princess| [''Blushes''] You're welcome, Finn! [''Giggles and runs off'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''To Princess Bubblegum.''] You look like sick, grey meat, but we're gonna jack you up so awesome.}}
{{L|Finn| We should wheel 'er to her bedroom, right?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks.}}
{{L|[''Princess Bubblegum closes her eyes.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Like ''fake'' magic?}}
{{L|Jake| Yeah, like [''Jake's voice trails off as the screen turns black.''] bruh bruh bruh, bruh...}}
{{L|[''Scene shifts to Princess Bubblegum's bedroom.'']}}
{{L|Finn and Jake| Princess... Princess... [''Princess Bubblegum opens her eyes.''] Surprise!}}
{{L|Finn| We picked every flower in the Candy Kingdom just for you! [''The flowers lie in the room, piling half-way up the wall in some places.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Whoo-oo!}}
{{L|[''She says nothing.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Princess Bubblegum?}}
{{L|[''She makes a strange guttural noise and irregularly bends her body.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, ''jeez''!! [''He hides behind Finn.''] What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?!}}
{{L|Finn| [''whispering''] Quiet, dude. We're supposed to take care of her, not make her feel bad!}}
{{L|Jake| I know, man, but she just seems... ''weird''.}}
{{L|Finn| She's just messed up from the accident, man. We just have to take care of her 'til she feels better.}}
{{L|Jake| Uh... Okay, dude.}}
{{L|[''They look at the bed and gasp; she's gone. Sounds are heard from the bathroom. They go there.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Princess! Princess, no! You shouldn't be out of bed! [''Finn picks her up and carries her back.''] Princess... I... I gotta tell ya somethin'. Uh... Jake... [''He nudges his head slightly to signal Jake to get out.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Oh. Gotcha. I'll go get some tea! [''He cuts his way through the pile of flowers and exits.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Princess... this sweater you made me kept me safe. I almost got super messed up, but... it saved me. And I wanted to say... thank you for imbuing this sweater with the power of liking someone a lot. Because... I like you a lot. [''Princess Bubblegum is looking at him.''] [''Finn blushes''] Haha, uh... We shouldn't talk about this now. You should rest.}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| [''Weakly''] Finn... I need you to get me some things...}}
{{L|Finn| Yes, Princess.}}
{{L|Peppermint Butler| [''Entering with Jake''] Princess! I brought you some tea—[''He gasps, dropping the tea and sees Princess Bubblegum talking to Finn. He hisses like a cat.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Whoa... [''Peppermint Butler runs away on all fours.''] Uh... somethin' weird's goin' on...}}
{{L|Finn| [''approaches Jake from behind.''] Jake!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Startled''] AH!}}
{{L|Finn| I'm gonna get some stuff for PB. Be right back.}}
{{L|[''Jake makes a worried noise. He turns and looks at the princess who is breathing deeply and creepily.'']}}
{{L|Jake| [''Somewhat scared''] Hey... Princess... Sorry you're not feelin' good. [''She says nothing and looks at him annoyed (still breathing deeply).''] Oh! I'll sing you a song! You love it when I sing songs!}}
{{L|[''Jake grabs a pink microphone and small speaker, and forms bongos on his stomach, beginning to sing [[Not Feelin' Good Song|his song]]. Princess Bubblegum is visibly annoyed and suddenly has a deeper voice. She growls and puts her hand in a bush, wilting every single flower in the room.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Uh... [''Princess Bubblegum convulses and yells gibberish.''] Uh, this song's not that good. It's a bad one. I... I'm stoppin'. [''She yells again.''] ...And starting a ''new'' song! [''Plays bongos''] [''Princess Bubblegum yells in utter agitation. Her bed begins jumping up and down. Suddenly, demonic flames engulf the room.''] AAH... [''Princess Bubblegum touches him'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| [''apparently melting.''] Jake...}}
{{L|Jake| AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!! [''Flees room''] OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY '''''GLOB!!''''' [''To himself''] Maybe the toxic waste did somethin' to her brain—made her have demon powers—or ''somethin’''! [''Finn runs towards the bedroom door with paraphernalia in his arms.''] Yo, dude! Wait! What's all ''that'' biz?!}}
{{L|Finn| Uh, bleach, lighter fluid, ammonia, gasoline, I dunno. Lady stuff. Plutonium...}}
{{L|[''Princess Bubblegum exits the room.'']}}
{{L|Jake| No, man... no... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| [''Grabbing ingredients''] Thanks. [''Goes back in'']}}
{{L|Finn| No probs!}}
{{L|Jake| Wait! Hold on!}}
{{L|Finn| What's up?}}
{{L|Jake| Listen... PB's bed was on ''fire''.}}
{{L|Finn| What?! Is she okay?!}}
{{L|Jake| [''Whispering''] She ''made it'' on fire.}}
{{L|Finn| With a match?}}
{{L|Jake| No, man. With her brain... I think... [''Finn stares confused.''] Look, man, I'll show you!}}
{{L|Finn| Jake, wh—}}
{{L|Jake| Shh!! [''Jake carefully opens the door. The room is burnt to a crisp, and Princess Bubblegum is gone.''] P-P-P-Princess...?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Pointing to bathroom''] Over there! [''They go in front of the door. Finn knocks.''] PB? You in there?}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| [''Threateningly''] I'm ''busy''!}}
{{L|Finn| See? It's fine. She's just havin' private time.}}
{{L|Jake| I'm lookin' in! [''Looks through keyhole'']}}
{{L|Finn| JAKE, WHAT THE ''HEY''?!}}
{{L|Jake| Oh, my ''gloob''!}}
{{L|Finn| [''blushing.''] Come on, man, that's ''pervy''!}}
{{L|Jake| You don't even ''know'', man.}}
{{L|Finn| DUDE?!}}
{{L|Jake| Look! [''Jake forces Finn to look through the keyhole.''] See it!}}
{{L|[''Princess Bubblegum's skin is now black, and her shape has changed tremendously. She's putting the ingredients from before into the tub and drinking it.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Hold on, Peebles! [''He smashes down the door.''] PRINCESS! [''She grows bigger as she drinks the chemicals. She then picks up the whole bath tub and drinks deeply.''] AAH! PUT DOWN THE TUB!}}
{{L|[''She throws it down and knocks Finn and Jake through a wall. Ice King is revealed to have been listening in. Princess Bubblegum smashes her way out of the castle.'']}}
{{L|[[Gumball Guardian]]| Evil presence detected!! [''Grapples with monster Princess Bubblegum''] Must defend!!}}
{{L|[''Back at the Candy Castle'']}}
{{L|Ice King| [''poking Finn's face.''] Hey, Finn, are you dead or what?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Waking up''] Whaaah?... Ice King? What are ''you'' doing here?}}
{{L|Ice King| Hey. I had to keep an eye on the princess because she's being possessed by the Lich.}}
{{L|Finn| [''Grunts''] You don't know that.}}
{{L|Ice King| But I do. I saw it with my [[Wizard Eyes|wizard eyes]]! [''Scene changes to the well.''] In the well, I saw something come out of the Lich and go into the princess. But I wasn't sure it was real [''scene returns to normal.''] because when you have stanky old wizard eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like crazy crazy crazy in your face all the time! [''Strange creatures dance around Finn and Jake in the Ice King's vision. He sighs''] [''To himself''] All the time... [''To the duo''] Guys, let me help you. I don't want my future wife to be... physically unattractive.}}
{{L|Finn| Listen, you old poot. I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice. GET ''STUFFED''. Come on, Jake.}}
{{L|[''Ice King groans in sadness as they exit.'']}}
{{L|Finn| We're coming, Princess!}}
{{L|Jake| Dude! I think we should let the Ice King help! He can freeze her, which could buy us some t—}}
{{L|Finn| Dump ''that'' mess! I'mma set 'er free with my like-like sweater!}}
{{L|Jake| Woooh, do it! [''Propels Finn towards her with his hind end.'']}}
{{L|Finn| [''while hurtling through the air.'']I like you, Princess!!}}
{{L|[''Princess Bubblegum punches Finn, who screams.'']}}
{{L|Jake| Finn!!}}
{{L|[''Finn is knocked back to the castle, next to a forlorn Ice King.'']}}
{{L|Finn| Urrgh... [''To himself''] Liking her... didn't ''work''. She's unstoppable... unless... [''He sees her stomping on Jake's head and sighs.''] [''Reluctantly''] Ice King, I... I need you to freeze Princess Bubblegum. Will you help me?}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Gasps''] Are you suuuuure?}}
{{L|Finn| [''Annoyed''] Yes.}}
{{L|Ice King| Great! Weeee! [''Laughs and grabs Finn before exiting'']}}
{{L|[''They fly towards her.'']}}
{{L|Finn| I'll distract 'er up top, you freeze 'er legs!}}
{{L|Ice King| [''Throwing Finn''] Wah!}}
{{L|Finn| I'M A CAT! I'M AN AGILE CAT! JAKE! DUCK! [''Jake retracts his body and falls to the ground. Finn grabs Princess Bubblegum's hair and covers her face with it.''] MEOW, ICE KING! [''Ice King grunts as he freezes the monstrosity with visible difficulty. A bird brings Finn down to the ground before he's frozen.''] Thanks, bird!}}
{{L|[''The Candy People gather around and cheer.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| Yeah! Whoopie!}}
{{L|Finn| You did good, Ice King.}}
{{L|Ice King| Oh, yeah?}}
{{L|Finn| Yeah, man.}}
{{L|[''Suddenly, Princess Bubblegum topples over and her body is totally shattered. Finn looks at Jake, who both have  a look of utter and total shock and horror.'']}}
{{L|Ice King| Okay. I didn't kill 'er this time. Everybody saw that, right?}}
{{L|Gumball Guardian| [''shattered.''] Duuuude...}}
{{L|Finn| We gotta get 'er to the hospital!}}
{{L|[''Scene shifts back to the hospital.'']}}
{{L|Dr. Ice Cream| Start assembling! Here, try to connect these two pieces! [''The pieces don't connect.''] Turn it... [''The wads of gum stick.''] Perfect. [''The wad of gum is put on Princess Bubblegum's head to make a piece of her hair.''] Give me more pieces, [[Doctor Princess]]!}}
{{L|Dr. Princess| That's all we have, Dr. Ice Cream!}}
{{L|Dr. Ice Cream| What?! That can't be!}}
{{L|Nurse Pound Cake| [''Gasps''] What do we do, Doctor?}}
{{L|Dr. Ice Cream| [''sighing''] ...I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake.}}
{{L|[''Outside the emergency room, everyone is chattering.'']}}
{{L|Finn| I hope she's okay...}}
{{L|Nurse Pound Cake| Attention, everyone...}}
{{L|Finn| [''In desperation''] '''IS PB OKAY?!?'''}}
{{L|Nurse Pound Cake| Yes... but there were some complications.}}
{{L|Finn| NOOOOOOO!!!!}}
{{L|Nurse Pound Cake| Yes... I'm afraid... there wasn't enough gum to work with, so it appears Princess Bubblegum is now...... younger. [''A young Princess Bubblegum steps out of the emergency room. Everyone gasps, astonished.''] She's 13 years old now.}}
{{L|Ice King| Aw, dang it! Well, I'm outta here. Goodbye, everyone. [''Exits'']}}
{{L|Finn| 13 years old? That's how old ''I'' am. [''Princess Bubblegum smiles at Finn. He blushes.''] Uh...}}
{{L|Jake| [''Amused''] Whoa...}}
{{L|[''She walks up to him.'']}}
{{L|Princess Bubblegum| [''Embracing him''] Give me a hug, hero.}}
{{L|[''Everyone cheers. Finn embraces her. Suddenly the camera pans menacingly past the crowd and reveals the waving [[snail]]—possessed by the Lich. The story ends.'']}}
