Hey, finn, just wanted to seehow the nature walk is going.

Uh...

You know,those marshmallow kids

Remind me of youwhen you were a young lad.

Uh...

I'm glad you're helping themget on the right path.

Thanks.Okay, got to run.

I'll assumeeverything's great

‐huh?‐huh?

He just pulled one overon the princess.

But he's a dope!

Nah.Don't you get it?

He's just pretendingto be a dope,

But deep down,he's a grifter like us.

What?

See?Look at him right now.

He's all, "Who ‐‐ me?"Ha.

We could learn a lotfrom him.

Teach useverything you know, finn.

I guess that works.

We have to keep warmin the woods,

So we're gonna builda fire.

So, you take a minimumof two sticks,

And you rub them together.

‐huh?‐huh?

Um, okay.

You need to scama couple of sticks.

You can usually spotyour average dimwitted sticks

Around these tree dummies.

You trick them into a bundlelike so.

You grab two...Marks

And defraud theminto rubbing together.

You flimflam your breathonto the sticks.

[ blowing ]

You bamboozlethese flaming idiot sticks

Onto the other marks.

And all of themwill catch on fire...

‐whoa!‐whoa!

These sticksare stone‐cold dopes.

[ laughter ]

[ thunder rumbles ]

Looks like the cloudsare gonna drop a dime on us.

So I'll show youse guyshow to build a shelter.

‐build?‐build?

Yeah. You can always scamnature into being a shelter.

You finda couple more branch rubes.

You misleadthe longest branch

To lay horizontalbetween two blockhead trees.

Then you double‐crosssome leafy boughs

Into leaningagainst each other.

Bam!You got a roof.

[ laughter ]

You like how I did that?

You got to bereal conniving.

Stick with me, boys.

I'll teach youall the forest hustles.

When you get hungry, you sneakup to a "Boosh," and wham!

You hoax the berries.

Heh!Food for nothing!

These bushesare some easy marks, fellas.

Good thingwe scammed a fire.Yeah.

This open air would havehoodwinked our body temperature.

Toss me someof those sweet bloobies, gary.

Into being thrownover to finn?

Just yank it down!

[ bubbling ]

Yank it down?What does that mean?

We haveto go old school.

‐no way, man.‐no way, man.

We promised ourselvesnever to go old school

Unless thingsgot serious.

Things have gotten serious.

Maybe this vine needsa sandwich packed with a slap!

Together: [ chanting ]finn! Finn! Finn!

Thanks,marshmallow kids.

I thoughti was going to sink forever.

But we failed your test,mr. Finn.

We couldn't scam this guyinto being a rope.

We had to resortto low violence.

Together: we ain't worthyto be your students.

You can't use scams to savesomebody from quicksand.

You kids weren't scamming sticksor branches or anything.

You've been campingthe whole time.

♪
