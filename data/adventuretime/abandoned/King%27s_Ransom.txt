What makes you thinkwe took him?
'cause it's obvious ‐‐you took gunter,
Because gunter is likeyour jake.
Wait, what?
Or maybe gunter's likeyour finn.
The point is, you guys havealways resented us
For that fact, and that rightthere constitutes motive...
[ whimpers ]and conspiracy to harm
My little road dog,gunter!
[ sobbing ]
Hey, jake, do you thinkyou could, like,
Turn into a little gunterand go over to him?
That's gonna bekind of weird.
Yeah, butit'll calm him down, so...
All right, all right,all right.

Wenk, wenk.
Aww, lookat the little guy.
You want to try telling uswhat happened?
Okay, so,we were watching
Some young men's juniorfigure skating championships
On the tube ‐‐semi‐finals.
I went to the kitchen to fix usup something to eat.
When I came back,he was gone.
Hmm...
What do you think, jake?Should we check out theice kingdom for clues?
Or we could geta real good night's sleep
And start freshand early in the morning.

Wenk, wenk.

All: gunter!
‐hey, gunter!‐gunter?!
See?He's gone.
You're sureyou've checked everywhere?
He's notbehind the fridge.
He's not hangingwith his boys.
‐wenk, wenk.‐wenk, wenk.
He's not anywhere nearthat ransom note.
Did you just say"Ransom note"?!
Yeah, what?You guys act like
You ain't never heardof no ransom note before.

"If you ever wantto see gunter again,
Go to moose bone clearingin the forgotten forest.
Come alone.Don't bring any cops."
Oh, no, we better go dowhat he says!
[ echoing ] I'm comingfor you, gunter!

You know, this could all just besome kind of a goof.
He seems for real.
Both:yo, ice king, wait up!
Hey, man,we're coming with you.
But they said no cops.
We're not cops.
Yeah, we are!
And this cop is your best chanceat finding gunter!
There'smoose bone clearing!
I wonder if it's calledthat because it's shapedlike a moose bone.

Okay, we'reright behind you.

Voice: [ echoing ] put the crownon the ground and leave.
Cops ‐‐ what cops?
Man: I‐I didn't mentionany cops.
Oh, wait, I mean ‐‐first, show me gunter.
Man: no.
Okay.

Poor gunter.I hope he's okay.
This is the dayi found him.
And this ishis first birthday.
His 15th birthday.
His 115th birthday.
The last time I saw gunter,
I was yelling at himfor pooting.
But it wasn't gunterwho pooted.
It was me![ sobbing ]
Hey, man,you can't blame yourself.
Everybody poots.
[ rustling ]

Get him!

Finn: hey!

For some kind of job.

All I know issomebody was rounding up foxes
For some kind of job.
But I wantedno part of it ‐‐ honest.

When I'm, like, miles and milesaway from the crown.

Some kind of tin canto communicate.
Tin can ‐‐ oh, hey, I thinki saw one over there.

It'll lead usto the kidnappers.
Oh, yeah.Good call!

Hurry!Get in!Shotty!

[ energy humming ]
[ click!Humming stops ]

[ energy warbles ]

I hope they've beenfeeding him right.
If he doesn't like his food,
He'll just spit itright back at you.
[ chuckles ]finn still does that.
Man, the only reasoni spit those meatballs up is
Because they were,like, hecka‐old.
Oh, yeah, my bad.
Ooh!
Oh, gunter!
