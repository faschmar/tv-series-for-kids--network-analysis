Eh. It's all intro stufffor kids.

Look at this janky thing.

[ Babyish voice ]I'm a dumb toy for babies!

[ Normal voice ] Experimenterstuff's just boring.

Boring can stillbe important.

It's all partof the Founders' plan.

Are you freestylingyour own verse

No, but that song isdeeply satisfying.

Chillax, K‐Bot.

You're getting bigand hunky.

Yeah! Being a Seeker's great!

I love my beefy...bod.

Heh.

Jake: Aah!

Finn: Oh hey,I think it...stopped!

Aah! Ohh!Whee!

Aah!

Huh. This was more funin my dreams.

Dudes, I found Susan!

Susan!

What's up with her, man?

I think she's sleepwalking.

Let's just find outwhere she's going.

[ Yawns ]

[ Joints pop ]

[ Door whooshes ]

[ Mattress creaks ]

Jake: What's she doing?

I think she's, uh, getting readyto sleepwalk‐sleep.

Man, this island is nasty.Who'd want to live here?

[ Boing ]

You know, there are peopleon the other side of the world

that are never gonna seethese stars.

That's bunk, Frieda.We're the only people left.

The islands are likea beautiful safe haven.

I've read all the old storiesabout 'em, you know?

About other placesand people.

I'd like to see those placesone day, and meet those people.

They can't all be monsters.

You can't say that, Frieda.

Oh, relax.I'm just globbin'.

Hey, watch this.

[ Beep ]

[ Static crackles ]

[ Laughs ] That's notwhat I look like.

Yeah, it is! Come on, flex!

[ Laughs ] See?

[ Static crackles ]

Wow. Am I really that buff?

I look great!

Don't you just lovethis place?

Yeah.

[ Sigh ] Yeah.

Okay, class,before we start today's lesson,

I need to announce thatwe're missing

a number of contrapulators

and an expensiveunilateral phase detractor.

If you're using these itemsfor personal projects,

you need to first equip themin your character file, okay?

Since today is Founders Friday,we're going to sing

our Founders Song.[ Blips ]

I have to go pee!

Kara!

[ Panting ]

[ Metal jangles ]Frieda?

Frieda, no!What are you doing?

Go back to class, Kara.You didn't see me.

♪♪

Stop running!Stop chasing!

Kara: Omph!Frieda: Aah!

[ Loud thud ]

[ Groaning ]

Frieda, are you tryingto leave us?

Leave me?

I was gonna write a note.

Listen, someone might see usout here.

We can talk in that cave.

Wha‐‐

No, you don't haveto carry me!

[ Gasp ]

Uhh!

What is that?

It's a foolproof wayoutta here.

But why? We're safe here.

We have no freedom, Kara!

I want to seewhat's out there.

It's all just bad stuffout there.

You're only gonna get hurt.Maybe.

But maybe getting hurtisn't the worst thing there is.

I want to be me,

and that's never gonnahappen here.

Frieda, I'm sorry, I just ‐‐But you can help me!

I'm only missingthe engine now, see?

And you're so strong,you can carry it in one trip.

This is...

I have to go...think.

Uh, okay.

I'll be here.

Hey, Kara. You're not gonnatell on me, right?

It's gonna be okay.

Dr. Gross?

Kara! My teacher's pet.

And you know I mean thatin a good way.

Listen, um, sorry aboutrunning off earlier.

When you gotta go,you gotta go.

But that's not really whatyou wanna talk about, right?

Well, you know howyou always say

that humans will findthe best way?

The Founders get creditfor that bit of wisdom.

If someone found a way,that's, uh, different from ours,

but seems to work for them,

couldn't that also bea good way?

Ah. You've heard someHider preaching, haven't you?

Well, listen, kid.

We tried exploringthe outside world,

and we were almostdestroyed!

We're the last humans,

so it's our responsibilityto stay here,

and it's your responsibilityto help these misguided Hiders.

Right.

[ Loud clank ]

Your engine.You just broke it!

What?![ Laughs ] I'm kidding.

It must weigh, like, a ton.

How would you have done this...[ Grunts ] without me?

I don't know,maybe roll it on tubes,

or findsome hunky Hider somewhere?

Mm, you better hurry.

I'll give you a push offso they don't hear the engine.

Come with me, Kara.

Frieda, I'm ‐‐
