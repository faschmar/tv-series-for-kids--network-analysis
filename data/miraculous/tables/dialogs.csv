So they took me to the temple. I wasn't very happy there. I would have preferred to live with my parents and be with other children my age. I didn't want to be a guardian of anything. One of the test to become a guardian required me to watch over a grimoire he managed to save, and the Miraculous Box. The very last Miraculous Box. That's when I realized my sentimonster had devoured all the other Miraculous Boxes that were kept in the temple. And when the monks tried to stop it—the temple, the Order of the Guardians, everything… it was destroyed. I tried to run away from the sentimonster. But by doing so, I lost the grimoire and both the Butterfly and the Peacock Miraculous.
