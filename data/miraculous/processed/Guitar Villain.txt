Jagged:::Mah Miraculous!
Jagged:::So, what do you think of the first single of my next album? Can you feel it, Bob? Isn't it killer?
Bob::: Not bad, Jagged, not bad. But if you really want to be making something killer, let's talk about this duet with Mr. XY.
Jagged::: No way. He's not a rocker, he's a baby! I bet he doesn't even shave yet.
Bob::: Well, this baby just pushed you out of the number one sales spot.
Jagged::: And? Doesn't make him a true musician like me. Penny thinks everything I'm doing's rock star material. She thinks I'm killer.
Bob::: Penny might be your agent, but I'm your real boss. Listen. Bottom line is that Bob Roth Records cannot afford to be number two in sales! Or rep a number two rock star! Get real, Jagged! You're going to have to modernize your music. Change the way you look. Get a whole new style!
Jagged::: You want to talk about real? I'm a genuine rock 'n' roller, Bob, not some pop star in diapers. I'm a real artist. Real talent! Even my hair is real. And that's what people love about me.Isn't that right, Fang? Yeah.And the artwork you came up with for my album is a waste of my time! Seriously, Bob, what is this trash? It looks like a perfume ad!
Bob:::And that's what people want these days!
Jagged::: Well, I don't. My album covers are raw to the bone, exuding the smell of sweat and leather!
Bob::: You do know, don't you, that if your next album doesn't rate #1 on the charts, it'll be the last one you ever do with Bob Roth records.
Jagged::: I'd rather put out nothing at all than sing some pathetic duet with a baby-faced nobody.
Penny::: Bob, Jagged and I had an idea. Its concept is modern, but it also respects Jagged's own...rugged style.
Jagged:::The schoolgirl who made these glasses has some real talent. She totally gets my style. She's going to design the cover of my new album.
Bob::: A schoolgirl?
Penny::: See? That's just it. She's the same age as the target audience.Here's her address.
Bob::: 
Bob:::Okay! But just think about that duet with Mr. XY.
Jagged::: Find that girl, Bob!
Bob::: So, are you interested?
Marinette::: Uh...wait, wait, wait. Let me get this straight. You want...me to design the album cover for Jagged?! My...all-time favorite singer?!
Bob::: That's right! Requested by Jagged himself.I brought a few visuals so you can get a sense of what we're going for.
Marinette:::This doesn't seem like Jagged material. More like...a perfume ad!
Bob::: This is the direction of his new image. More modern, current!
Marinette::: ...really? Wow. I was thinking more along the lines of–
Bob:::Don't think! This is what is selling these days.
Marinette::: Uh...sure.
Bob::: And one last thing, Marinette. We're in a hurry! We need your proposal by the end of the day. You up to it?
Marinette:::Uh, yeah! Okay.
Bob:::See you later, then!
Tom:::My daughter, famous album cover designer. You're going to kill it! Marinette style. Boo-yah! 
Marinette:::Oh, why does Jagged want to change his style? XY's music is so cold and lifeless, repetitive, mundane, the total opposite of Jagged. And what I've just done here is...ugh...is so not my style either.
Tikki::: So why are you doing it, then?
Marinette::: Because that's what I was asked to do.
Tikki::: Maybe you should follow your gut feeling. Do something that's really you!
Marinette::: But you heard what Mr. Roth said!This is what's selling these days.
Tikki::: Yeah, but...Jagged wanted you because of your style!
Marinette::: Augh, the pressure! I can't deal!
Tikki::: Marinette, superhero of France, defender of the innocent, fighter of all the rights, can't deal with the pressure?
Marinette:::Augh. 
Jagged:::What happened to the raw, impulsive artistry that made this?
Marinette::: Yeah, about that, Mr. Roth told me–
Bob:::Marinette's young, Jag! She represents our target audience. She's come up with a modern concept that's exactly what you need.
Jagged::: Doesn't it look a lot like the cover of that YZ guy? Marinette, don't listen to Bob. Could you do another one? You know, Jagged style?
Marinette:::Yeah, sure!But I don't know if–
Jagged:::You're my girl, Marinette. Remember: raw, impulsive artistry. I think we're all done here, Bob.
Bob::: No! We are not! 
Penny:::Come with me, Marinette. Don't worry! Just do your best, okay?
Bob::: We aren't–Aah!
XY:::Why am I number one? Simple. It's not about music, it's about technology. This computer is programmed to produce music and lyrics people will like. It's guaranteed success. 
Jagged::: 
Nadja:::You knocked Jagged off the #1 spot. What do you think of him?
XY:::Bleah! Jagged, the hero of rock 'n' roll? Try Ragged Stone. That guy's old school, a has-been. His guitar solo is so ten minutes ago.
Jagged:::Me? Old-school? A has-been?!
XY::: He's had his career, but it's over now. He'll never be number one, not while XY is here.
Jagged:::Why, you little perfume ad!
XY::: My music is killer.
Jagged:::He's stealing my catchphrases!
Nadja::: Tonight, Mr. XY will be giving a very special one-time concert from the top of the Eiffel Tower, to celebrate his album's success, and thank his awesome fans.
XY::: Hey Ragged, if you wanna know what today's music sounds like, come to my concert. I'll reserve you a front-row seat, old man, you know—in case your hearing's going.
Jagged:::He can't talk about me like that! This guy's an insult to rock...and me!
Hawk Moth:::I feel a disharmonious soul, an angry discord. Ideal prey for my evil akumas.Go find that Jagged, and rock his world!
Hawk Moth::: Guitar Villain, I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you and your vicious crocodile the power to show the whole world that you are the number one rocker! Just make sure you get me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous in return.
Jagged::: Yeah! Let's rock! 
Adrien::: Hey. Marinette! Hey, hi!
Marinette::: Hey! Oh, uh… what's going on? I mean, how's up? I mean, oh, uh…
Adrien::: Well, uh…
Chloé:::Hi, Adrikins! There you are. Amazing Chloé has got a surprise for you! She knows you're a fan of Jagged's.
Adrien::: Uh, I am!
Chloé::: Sooo, you get a private meeting with your favorite star. He's staying right here in Daddy's hotel! Is Chloé the best, or is Chloé the best?
Marinette:::Did you hear that?
Tikki::: Chloé speaking in the third person? Totally annoying!
Marinette::: No! The part where Adrien likes Jagged just like me! Now I definitely can't mess up the artwork.
Tikki::: So, now what?
Marinette::: I'm going to design Jagged's next album my way, and no one else's.
Tikki::: Way to go, Marinette! Follow your instincts!
Adrien's bodyguard::: Hmm?
Marinette:::Uh, talking bag! New technology! Imported from Japan! 
Chloé::: You and I both like the same kind of music. Isn't that awesome?
Adrien::: I… thought you liked Mr. XY.
Chloé::: Of course I do! Don't you?
Adrien::: Not really, no.
Chloé::: Uh… well, neither do I. See? We have the same great taste!
Bob::: A duet with Mr. XY would show everyone that Jagged—
Guitar Villain::: From now on, you can call him Guitar Villain. He'll never do a duet with Mr. XY! In fact, soon, there won't even be a Mr. XY! Rockin' Riff, baby!Soon, there'll be nothing but Guitar Villain fans, the one and only rocker on Earth.
Hawk Moth:::Such symphony to my ears. It won't be long before Ladybug and Cat Noir show up to meet their doom!
Chloé::: Hurry, Adrien, get me out of here!
Guitar Villain:::Yeah! Guitar Villain! Wooh!
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Guitar Villain::: Rockin' Riff, baby!
Guitar Villain::: Rockin' Riff, baby!
Cat Noir:::Hey, Jagged! C'mon! Why don't you try to rock my world?
Guitar Villain::: The name's Guitar Villain, pussycat. Awesome Solo!
Guitar Villain::: Awesome Solo!Welcome to my fan club, baby!
Marinette:::Do you see what I see, Tikki?
Tikki::: If you see a dragon, then yes I do.
Marinette::: I've got to transform! 
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on!
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, you okay?
Cat Noir::: Good to see you, my lady.
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, your stick!
Guitar Villain:::You're wasting my time. I've got a concert to get to! 
Ladybug::: Come on, we gotta follow them!His power comes from playing his guitar. We've got to keep him from performing.
Cat Noir::: Well, I won't let you do this solo.
Guitar Villain::: You're an insult to the music world, XY!An hologram?!
Guitar Villain::: Where's the real XY?
Théo::: He's not here yet! The concert's not until tonight! I-I'm just setting up the special effects, dude!
Guitar Villain:::Awesome Solo!Where's Mr. XY? Answer me!
Théo::: On TV! He's at the TV station!
Guitar Villain::: Rockin' Riff, baby!
Guitar Villain::: You again?! To the TV studios, Fang! 
Cat Noir::: He's gonna get there before us!
Ladybug:::And we better make sure he doesn't find what he's looking for.
Nadja::: KidZ+ TV. How may I help you?
Cameraman:::Ladybug says we're in danger.
Alec::: Mr. XY...um, we have to leave the studio immediately!
XY::: What the heck?
Alec:::We just got a call from Ladybug. You're not safe here.Hit the credits!
Guitar Villain:::Where's that studio?!
Receptionist::: On third floor! 
Guitar Villain:::Awesome solo! 
Alec::: Everything's gonna be fine. I'm sure it's just a precaution.
Ladybug::: We have to get you to safety.
XY::: So what this Guitar Villain going to do? Blow me away with his evil guitar solo?
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: Yeah!
Cat Noir::: Once we catch Guitar Villain, we'll get you to the Eiffel Tower, just in time for your live performance.
XY::: Pff! Who even cares? My roadies can just project my image on stage. Live concerts are so ten minutes ago—
Guitar Villain::: Good job, Fang!I found you at last, XY! Ready for the show?
XY::: Dude, are you Ragged Stone?
Guitar Villain::: Was Jagged. Now I'm Guitar Villain! Ha ha, don't worry, you're not gonna become one of my fans. You don't deserve it. I've got something special in store for you. Something with a little rock 'n' roll! 
XY::: NOOOO!
Cat Noir::: Back to square one.
Ladybug::: I get the feeling we'll in for quite a concert. You ready?
Cat Noir::: To rockin' riff, baby!
Guitar Villain::: Hello Paris!You said your music is the only killer music around? Is that right?

Jagged::: Thank you.
Cat Noir:::How about an autograph, Jagged? 
Ladybug::: Which reminds me, I still have work to do! Bug out!
Cat Noir and Jagged:::Huh?

Marinette::: Done! 
Tikki::: Jagged will love it!
Marinette::: I hope so! It's one-hundred percent Marinette. It's my awesome solo!
Tikki::: Rock 'n' roll! 
Jagged::: Oh, yeah. This is it! You did it, girl! I can almost smell the leather and sweat just radiating off this design!
Marinette::: Uh...um, you actually are smelling it. I concocted a special scent sticker for your album.
Jagged:::I want it. I got to have it. It's authentic. It's original. It's... so Jagged.
Bob::: No you can't! It's not what the public-
Jagged:::Fine, then I'm outta here! I'm sure another record company will be perfectly happy with the #2 chart topper.
Marinette::: Yee-haw! Tikki, I can't believe I just designed a cover for Jagged's new album!
Tikki::: I'm so proud of you, Marinette! 
Nadja::: In today's headlines, Jagged's new album hit the charts at #1, hitting XY off his throne.Welcome back, king of rock 'n' roll!
Adrien::: Um... hey there, Marinette.So, actually I'm a huge fan of Jagged and I saw you designed his new album cover.
Marinette::: I...I did!Crazy, huh?
Adrien::: I... wanted to ask if... I could get it... autographed?
Marinette::: Um, okay, sure... uh, I'll ask him. 
Adrien::: Ah, no. Um, actually I meant you. 
Marinette:::Me? Me? 
Adrien::: If you wouldn't mind.Awesome! Thanks, Marinette! 
Alya::: Girl, did I just imagine it, or did you just sign an autograph for Adrien?
Marinette::: I can't feel my legs anymore. Hold me up! I'm gonna fall over! Is he still around?
Alya::: It's okay. He's gone. You can fall over.
Marinette::: This is the happiest day of my life! Rock 'n' roll!
