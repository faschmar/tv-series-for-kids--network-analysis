Ziggy:::Oh... she's coming closer!
Marinette::: Manon!How about we do some drawing? You like drawing, right?AHH! Let's play hide-and-seek instead!...Okay?
Manon::: YEAAAH!
Marinette:::Oh! Wait! I...know, I know! Uh, beads! We'll make some bead and necklaces! 
Manon::: Yeah! Ella! Etta!
Ella and Etta::: Manon!
Alya::: Shoot! You didn't tell me you're already babysitting Manon. I'll go cancel my date with Nino at the movies.
Marinette::: Oh, no, don't! Uhh... the more, the... more pretty necklaces we can make!
Alya:::Are you sure?
Marinette:::Come on, just go enjoy your movie!
Alya::: Okay! Buzz me if you need me! 
Marinette::: Not the sewing box!
Marinette:::Don't! Stop, that's not fair!
Nino:::Oh. You didn't tell me you're already babysitting Manon and the twins.
Marinette::: Ah! One more kid won't make any difference.Go to the movies with your girlfriend.
Nino::: Wow! Thank you, Marinette! You really are the best! 
Marinette::: No! Not the kw—kwa-shies!
Ella::: Kwa-shies? Did you make them yourself?
Marinette::: Oh! Yes! They're my most recent sewing project. But it's a secret project, so you gotta put them back in the drawer—
Ella:::I'm gonna call this one Sock!
Etta:::Fly, Sock, fly!
Ella::: Throw it to me!
Manon::: I saw the bunny first!
Chris::: No, I did! No, me!
Manon::: No, me!
Marinette::: Oh! A movie! How about we all watch a fun movie together instead?
Manon, Chris, Ella and Etta:::YAY!Ladybug and Cat Noir!
Manon::: Don't you like it?
Marinette::: Yes! I do! I love it so much that I've seen it maybe one too many times. 
Marinette::: Adrien? Woohoo! Adrien! Oh, Adrien! Adrien!
Manon::: Aren't you gonna answer it?
Marinette::: Of course, I am! I'm answering, and speaking to him! Very normally.Adri-mine? Uh! Adrien, how are you? You need me to do you a... favor?
Adrien:::There's no one here on the set to repair it. And since I know how talented you are with sewing, I was hoping you could come and give me a hand.
Marinette::: In marriage? I'd love to! I didn't mean that first part or the second part. I mean, I'd love to help you, not marry you. Heh-heh!Operation Adrien's Rescue is a go. I'm jumping directly from level 2, talking to him, to level 48, doing Adrien a favor! And once I've helped him out, since he's so nice, polite, and grateful... He'll ask me:
Marinette:::How can I ever thank you, Marinette?
Marinette::: Well, Adrien, I've love it if you'd go to the movies with me to see The Umbrellas of Deauville!
Marinette:::How amazing, Marinette! That's my favorite film!
Marinette::: So, then, we'll go to the 3:17PM screening, because there's an 89.5% chance we'll pass André, the ice cream man, on the way. We'll share a sweet hearts ice cream cone, which will make us miss the beginning of the movie, and 
Manon:::Wouldn't it be more simple to just give him your drawing?
Marinette::: Huh! No, no! Telling a Boy you like him is way more complicated than a drawing.
Manon::: It's gonna be so cool to see you do it!
Marinette::: W-Wait a second. Sorry!You're not gonna see anything. You're gonna be good, and stay...
Marinette::: ...Ha-ha, not here at all! You guys are gonna go...Oh...
Tom::: We're off to the Chocolate Convention. See you tonight, sweetheart.
Marinette::: Oh...
Gina::: I'm learning kung fu in China, sweetie. Remember? Oh! And I met a little girl who reminds me so much of you.
Marinette::: Nope...
Rolland::: Why would I want to go out? I like it just fine here at home!
Marinette:::That's perfect!
Rolland::: No, no, no, and no again! Babysitting is too complicated! I got Brioche loaves to bake and-
Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris::: YAY! 
Manon::: Wow!Wow! What's this frisbee made of?
Marinette::: No, it's fragile!
Chris::: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Marinette::: Chris, no! STOP! Give me that!
Rolland::: First, a game of darts, then I'll show you kids how to make a potato cannon!
Ella and Etta::: YEAH!
Marinette::: NO!Forget the potato cannon and the darts. Too dangerous. Just keep it simple, Grandpa! Let them watch a cartoon!
Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris::: YEAH!
Rolland::: You call that simple? What are all these buttons anyway, and where do you put the video cassette?!
Marinette::: This is a laptop computer, and this is the keyboard. You don't need a cassette. The film is already on the hard drive.
Rolland::: Now you want me to drive somewhere to get the film? But that's not how it's done!
Marinette::: Don't worry, Grandpa. You don't have to drive anywhere! The kids know how to use it.
Marinette::: I'll be back as soon as I can. Thank you, Grandpa! Be quiet, kids! Goodbye! 
Rolland::: Hmm...
Marinette::: And now, let's go save Adrien! 
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm!
Rolland::: Hang on. I don't get it. The villain is that cat girl?
Etta:::Of course not! He's a Boy!
Chris::: And, and Cat Noir's a good guy!
Rolland::: Since when do good guys break everything?
Manon::: He's not breaking stuff! He's doing the Cataclysm thing to help Ladybug win!
Rolland::: Oh, okay. So, this Mime guy, he's the bad guy?
Ella::: No! Hawk Moth is the bad guy. He waits until the Mime gets really mad so he can akumatize him. And then he makes him think Ladybug and Cat Noir are the bad guys!
Rolland::: Argh! In my day, telling good guys from bad guys was much simpler! They would just fight each other and whoever was the strongest one wins!
Manon::: Oh, but Ladybug never hits anybody, 'cause she has her Lucky Charm!
Rolland::: Oh, what was this thingalucky now? 
Chris::: It's a thing she uses with other stuff to catch the akuma!
Etta::: And then she wins!
Rolland::: Stop, stop. This is way too complicated! Let's just watch my VHS copy of the '98 World Cup finals. At least that's something simple!
Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris::: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Marinette::: Perfect!
Adrien::: I'm so glad I thought to call you, Marinette. How can I ever thank you?
Marinette::: How would you like to be 89.5% late for a movie?
Adrien::: Hmm?
Marinette::: I meant to sing under the umbrellas of ice cream! AAAH! I'm so pleased that you're thanking me, and now I can't thank you enough for thanking me. Uh, no! What I meant to say was-
Adrien::: Marinette, you don't need to thank me. I'm the one thanking you! I have to go now. See you later! 
Marinette::: Uh, well, uh, thanks for saying thanks.UGGH! I messed it all up, as usual!
Tikki::: Don't you think you made it harder than it needed to be?
Marinette::: You're right, Tikki. I need a second chance.
Marinette::: I know!I'll just have to break the wing again! I'll set up a fishing rod and drop a hook to rip it! That way, Adrien will have to call me, so I'll come repair his wing again, and he'll say thank you again, and-
Tikki:::But that's even more complicated!
Marinette::: Love is always complicated, Tikki.
Rolland::: MARINETTE, I'M COMPLETELY LOST!
Marinette::: That's great news, Grandpa, but I can't talk right now. I have to borrow a fishing rod! Have fun! I'll be back soon!
Marinette::: Hey! Nice fishing rod!
Unnamed person with a fishing rod::: Uh... You think?
Rolland::: MARINETTE!?!
Rolland::: What is wrong with the world these days?! Why has everything become so complicated?! Waaaah!!!
Shadow Moth::: Ah! The overwhelming confusion of a grandfather faced with the complexities of our modern world. How difficult it is to adapt, especially when one is trapped in the past!Fly away, my little Akuma, and help him simplify this all-too-complicated world!
Shadow Moth:::Unravelder, I am Shadow Moth.
Rolland::: Unravelder? What kind of complicated name is that?
Shadow Moth:::Well, uh... Doctor Obsolete?
Rolland::: I'm not a Doctor!
Shadow Moth:::How about Simpleman? Will that do?
Rolland::: There! Now that's simple!
Shadow Moth::: Well, then, Simpleman, Ladybug and Cat Noir are also complicating my life. That's why I'm giving you the power to simplify everything.
Rolland::: Ah! Now that I understand!
Manon::: Oh, no! Grandpa Rolland!
Chris::: You got akumatized because of us?
Simpleman::: Don't worry, kids. You're not a problem at all. The problem is the world around you! I'm going to show you how much better life can be with everything is simpler!Oh! Argh!
Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris::: Hmm...
Shadow Moth:::And don't forget the simplest mission of all. Bring me back Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.
Simpleman::: Piece of cake! One blow from this baker's peel, and EVERYONE WILL BE HIT, SUPERHERO OR NOT!
Shadow Moth::: No! Wait!
Simpleman::: SIMPLIFICATION!!!
Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris::: Oh, no!
Shadow Moth::: Argh! Foolish villain! You hit me! I'm taking back your power!
Simpleman::: Make up your mind already, do you want your Miraculous or not?
Shadow Moth::: Hmm... Yes. Go ahead.
Simpleman::: You see how simple life can be when nothing is complicated?
Civilian 1::: Hm.
Civilian 1::: Why didn't you stop instead of driving right into me?
Civilian 2::: Turning's too complicated! All you had to do was back up!
Civilian 1::: Backing up is even more complicated! I'd rather just go straight, it's simpler!
Roger:::Since you're not letting me through, I'm prohibiting all cars! It'll be simpler this way. Car prohibited! Prohibited! Prohibited! And prohibited again!
Nadja::: I, Nadja, the reporter inside the TV, tell you all about the things happening around us. And today, things are going pretty badly, right, Clara?
Clara::: Yes, I'm Clara, and I'm a reporter in a helicopter! There are many problems in Paris! People are not happy at all, because their cars are immobilised!
Cameraman::: I can't see anything, the helicopter is going to fast!
Clara::: Stop, pilot. We can't see the cars anymore!
Pilot::: Uh... stop? Ah, there! There.
Vincent::: Mah, this photo session is too complicated, we just got to take photos of Adrien smiling, it would be more simple.
Marinette::: Why am I complicating my life with this fishing rod? I'm just gonna tell Adrien that I love him.
Marinette::: Adrien! Adrien!
Marinette::: Oh, a falling helicopter! What should I do? Oh, I know! I have to transform!
Tikki::: Careful, Marinette, it's a secret. You should hide first.
Marinette::: Oh, right! But where can I hide?
Marinette::: In the elevator, behind a metal pillar? It's a very hard choice.
Marinette::: Woah! Oh no, it took me way to long to think and now the helicopter's crashed!
Clara, Cameraman, and pilot::: Help! Ladybug, Cat Noir, save us!
Marinette::: Come on, Tikki. Spots on!
Vincent::: Okay guys, that's enough for today. I got all I need.
Adrien::: I'm supposed to smile, but I'm supposed to save people. This is a complicated choice.
Plagg::: The simplest thing to do is to would be to stay here and eat cheese!
Adrien::: No, Plagg! The simplest thing is to do as Ladybug does. She's always right, and I love her. So I'll just do what she does!
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Pilot::: Thank you, Cat Noir!
Cameraman::: Thanks!
Clara::: Thank you Ladybug!
Ladybug::: When bad things happen, it's simply the fault of the big bad-
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: SHADOW MOTH!
Cat Noir::: An akumatized villain is going to want to fight us so they can steal our Miraculous!
Ladybug::: Oh, Boy, it's gonna be really complicated.
Cat Noir::: Wouldn't it be simpler to fight Shadow Moth directly?
Ladybug::: Oh, of course!
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: Let's go!
Recycling Man::: Everything into the trash, much simpler.
Ella::: Simpleman! I want a Chocolate Pistachio cone!
Etta::: And I want caramel hazelnut and cherry!
André::: Oh, sorry, children, it's just vanilla now. Having only one flavor is much more simple!
Simpleman::: Now that's much better.
Ella::: I liked it better when everything was less simple.
Simpleman::: Hey! What's going on?
Pizza Delivery guy::: Veggie pizza for everyone! Only one choice of topping, it's much simpler!
Simpleman::: Meh, that's true!
Manon::: Seems kinda dangerous when things are simple. Don't you think?
Chris::: Ladybug and Cat Noir will be here soon. Don't worry.
Ladybug::: HEY!! SHADOW MOTH, WE'RE HERE!
Cat Noir::: Come and fight us!
Simpleman::: You see that kids? Simplified heroes means easily found Miraculous. Come on! Let's simply pick them up!
Shadow Moth:::Ha-ha! And I will stay hidden! That way I will win easily!
Ladybug::: Hey, Shadow Moth!!
Cat Noir::: Yoohoo!!
Simpleman::: Ladybug! Cat Noir!
Simpleman::: Give me your Miraculous!
Ella and Etta::: We're going to see the Lucky Charm for real! This is better than watching the movie!
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: No!
Simpleman:::Yes!
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: No!
Simpleman::: YES!
Simpleman::: Ha-ha-ha!
Manon::: There's usually more action.
Chris::: What if the bad guy wins?
Manon::: It'll be okay, Chris. Superheroes always win!
Ladybug::: Fighting is much more simple!
Cat Noir::: When nothing's complicated anymore!
Simpleman::: I haven't simplified you enough!
Simpleman::: Simplification!
Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris::: NO!
Nadja::: I'm Na-Na! Cla-Cla no longer here! Paris is all broken! Bug-Bug, Meow-Meow, help!
Parisian 1::: Vroom-vroom is too complicated!
Parisian 2::: I walk home with my feet now!
Officer Roger::: Jail, jail, jail, jail!
Parisian 3::: What for?
Officer Roger::: Hm... uh, me upset. Jail.
Manon::: Quick Ladybug! Use your Lucky Charm to fight the villain!
Ladybug::: Lucky Charm?
Ladybug::: Wow! Cool! Hey Simpleman, take this!
Ladybug::: Oww! Boo-boo, Lucky Charm!
Shadow Moth:::Candy! Simpleman! Candy for Miraculous! Everyone loves candy!
Simpleman::: Now that's a plan simple, efficient and easy to understand!
Simpleman::: Ladybug, Cat Noir? Let's stop fighting and make peace. Give me your miraculous and in exchange I'll give you some candy.
Ladybug::: Candy, I love candy!
Cat Noir::: Everyone loves candy!
Manon::: No! Never take candy from a stranger!
Chris::: He's doing that to steal your miraculous!
Ladybug::: I'm tired of Miraculous! I don't want them anymore! 
Cat Noir::: Me neither! Superheroes are lame! 
Shadow Moth:::Oh, yes! Yes!
Ella, Etta, Manon, Chris::: NOOO!
Chris::: You have to win against the bad guy!
Ella::: We don't want everyone to see weird like this.
Ladybug::: But the bad guy is too bad!
Cat Noir::: Look how strong he is!
Simpleman::: Ha! That's true!
Etta::: Our sister always telling us that you're the strongest!
Ella::: And that you're smarter than the bad guys!
Ladybug::: Lucky Charm is too complicated.
Manon::: No, it's very simple! It's like a riddle. For example, you can take the air out of the ball and then use a pipe to attach it to the bicycle pump! And, and then you throw it under the bad guy's stick!
Ladybug::: Without air in it?
Etta::: A-and when the ball's under the stick you just have to blow it up again!
Ella::: And when the ball grows bigger it'll make the stick bounce!
Chris::: Then Cat Noir can catch it and cataclysm it!
Ladybug::: But I don't have a bicycle pump.
Cat Noir::: Can I just cataclysm the bad guy?
Shadow Moth:::Hey! Explaining complicated stuff is cheating!
Simpleman::: You get there then. Sorry, but I'm gonna have to simplify you too kids! SIMPLIFICATION!
Chris:::Ladybug!
Ladybug:::Make it bounce! 
Simpleman::: HEY!
Manon::: Cat Noir! 
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm?!
Cat Noir::: It's true, my power is super simple!
Ladybug::: And repairing everything is even more simple!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little butterfly. The only thing I have to say is...
Ladybug and the kids::: Miraculous Ladybug!
Roger::: What are you doing in my car?
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: Pound it!
Manon::: Ladybug, Cat Noir! You saved us!
Ladybug::: No, kids. You saved us.
Cat Noir::: M'lady, to think we were this close to giving away our Miraculous... for candy?
Ladybug::: Of all the things we've faced, I never would've thought that such a simple power would be the most dangerous.
Ladybug::: Mr. Dupain, this magical charm will protect you from Shadow Moth.
Rolland::: Oh, is that so? How could this little thing protect me from Shadow-What's-His-Name? The world used to be so simple, I used to understand it! Now I don't understand anything anymore.
Chris::: You know, Grandpa Rolland, we don't understand everything either.
Etta::: But we are used to it.
Ella::: And what's cool is what we don't know, we can learn.
Manon::: It's funny it's kind of like a game that you have to win each time, but you're a grown-up and you're not used to it anymore, so it scares you.
Rolland::: You think I can still learn something at my age?
Etta::: Sure, if you want!
Marinette::: What am I doing, honestly? The truth is, I'm scared that Adrien will reject me if I tell him how I feel about him. That's why I over complicate everything, so that moment never comes. But whether my plan is complicated or simple, the result will be the same. So I might as well be simple and face my fear! I'm just gonna tell him that I love him quite simply.
Tikki::: Yes! Go on, Marinette! Be simple.
Marinette::: Adrien!
Adrien::: Marinette?
Marinette::: The ice cream umbrella like sewing perfume angels— ah! No! What I'm trying to say is that ice cream will eat your wings to sew them back up in a song— uhhh... Do you like fishing?
Adrien::: I don't know, I've never tried it.
Marinette::: Me neither! Well, I'm not gonna keep you any longer, okay? Now that you've got your wings back.
Vincent::: Action!
Marinette::: You know what, Tikki? Sometimes trying to be simple is just too complicated.
Rolland::: Go back way too early, sweetie? We haven't finished the movie yet!
Ella::: Quiet! It's the best part!
Marinette::: Superheroes love all that complicated stuff. Wouldn't you rather just watch a soccer game?
Rolland::: Plus not! It's actually quite simple. Come sit with us, we'll explain everything. So, look. This little guy in black is not a bad fellow. I think you know in red, well it's simple. Even when things are complicated, she never gives up! In fact, she reminds me of your grandmother when I first met her. I know it seems crazy, but she looks exactly like her! And all our ideas are kind of the same!
The kids::: Shhh!
