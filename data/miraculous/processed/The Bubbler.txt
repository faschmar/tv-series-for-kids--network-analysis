Adrien::: Father, he was just trying to do something cool for me. 
Nathalie:::Goodbye.

Nino::: It's not fair, Adrien. Harsh, uncool. 
Adrien::: Thanks anyway, Nino. 
Kid::: But, Daddy, please! 
Kid's Father::: No, it's not playtime. You've got your chores to do. 
Nino:::Ugh. Adults ruin everything all the time.

Hawk Moth:::Hawk Moth is my name and Bubbler is now yours. I will help you with these horrid adults and all you have to do in return is help me get something from Ladybug and Cat Noir.

Bubbler::: No more adults means total freedom! This is SOOO sweet! Off the hook! 
Woman::: Help!
Man::: Look out!
Children::: 
Hawk Moth:::Perfect.

Marinette::: Mom! MOM!Dad? Dad!
Tikki::: Your parents! Hawk Moth must've released another akuma.
Marinette::: I've got to find his newest villain ASAP.
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on!
Bubbler::: And now, party time! 
Bubbler::: Today is your lucky day, little dudes. The adults have taken the day off, so make the most of it. No chores, no homework, no more nagging, just fun, fun, fun, fun. This is The Bubbler's gift to you.

Adrien::: But Nino's been akumatized! I've gotta help him!
Plagg::: You may never get this chance again! C'mon, let's have a little fun while your father's away! Then we'll save Nino, trap his akuma, and all will be good. 
Adrien::: Okay, you're right. This might be the first day in my life that I actually get to do what I want for once.
Ladybug:::It's you and me, Bubbler. 
Adrien::: Yeah!Hey, nice party, I guess, since it's my first one.
Sabrina:::I'm requesting a slow dance.
Bubbler::: It's a bit early for that, isn't it?
Chloé::: Ugh.It's for Adrien. His first slow dance. Mm? 
Bubbler::: OH! You know it, girl. 
Adrien::: Is it me, or does everyone seem a bit weird?
Chloé::: Forget about them, let's go dance! C'mon! 
Ladybug::: There is no way this is happening. record.) A record?
Bubbler::: Dude! Who just hijacked my mix?
Ladybug::: Yours truly.Better bug out quick before I change back to normal.Spots off.
Tikki::: Marinette!
Marinette::: It was an emergency.
Tikki::: Yeah, if by emergency, you mean jealousy. You know what happens once you use your Lucky Charm. You only have minutes before-–
Marinette::: I turn back, I know. But I figured, The Bubbler, he's not going anywhere, we have time to get you some food to get your energy back up. Then, we'll get right back out there, I promise.
Marinette::: I've got to find a place where I can transform, fast.
Alya::: Where have you been, girl? I was so scared something had happened to you.
Marinette::: Me too! 
Alya::: I'm sure Ladybug and Cat Noir will show up in a minute to save us all. They never failed us. Meanwhile, come with me, I've got something for you.
Marinette::: Uh, there's something I've got to do first.
Alya::: It's about Adrien.
Marinette::: Okay.
Tikki:::Marinette, The Bubbler.
Marinette::: Okay, okay, in a sec.
Alya::: Look! Now you can sign your gift. 
Marinette::: Ah, yes!
Bubbler::: Hey, you. Why aren't you having fun?
Ivan::: None of your business.
Bubbler::: Then I'm going to make it my business. 
Marinette::: Love, Marinette. There. 
Tikki::: Right, we're good.Spots on , Marinette.
Marinette::: I can't do it now, Alya's here.
Alya::: What'd you say?
Marinette::: Go ahead! I'll meet you in the yard.
Marinette::: No! You were right, Tikki, I never should've waited this long.
Adrien::: Hey, Paris, how you doing?
Adrien::: Ladybug?
Ladybug::: Sorry, Bubbler, but the party is over.
Bubbler::: Why you gotta be like that?
Ladybug::: You made all the adults disappear, that's why! And now you're imprisoning anyone who isn't having fun. 
Bubbler::: You will not bust up my party! 
Adrien::: I think I've been a complete idiot.
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Cat Noir::: Looks like I made it just in time.
Ladybug::: I had it under control, , but thanks.
Hawk Moth:::Get the Miraculouses. I want those powers, NOW!
Bubbler::: Give me your Miraculouses before you run out of air.
Ladybug::: Dream on, Bubbler.
Bubbler::: Total party poopers, just like adults.
Ladybug::: Kids need adults.
Bubbler::: False! Kids need freedom, fun, let loose and live it up. Adults are controlling and bossy.
Ladybug::: But adults keep children safe and protected. They care for their kids, they love them!
Cat Noir:::Most adults do anyhow. You must bring the adults back!
Bubbler::: Nope, never. Know what, since you care so much about these adults, why don't you go float with them for a while? 
Hawk Moth:::What do you think you're doing Bubbler?! You're supposed to seize their Miraculouses!
Ladybug::: Use your Cataclysm!
Cat Noir::: Couldn't you have said that five hundred feet ago?
Ladybug::: We can't stay stuck in this bubble together forever. 
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm! 
Ladybug::: Should we see if you land on your feet this time?
Cat Noir::: No, thanks!
Ladybug::: Your stick, there! 
Cat Noir::: Got it! 
Ladybug::: Hang on! 
Cat Noir::: Good thing cats aren't afraid of heights.
Ladybug::: We've got to get to his bubble sword, that's got to be where the akuma is. 
Cat Noir::: Better hurry.
Bubbler::: Where is everybody? Get out here and party!
Ladybug::: Sorry to burst your bubble.
Alya:::Ladybug! 
Ladybug::: No one wants to party with you anymore, Bubbler.
Bubbler::: What's wrong with all you guys!? Why you gotta be such haters!? 
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: NOOO!
Bubbler::: Outer space is the next stop for your precious peeps, and they're never coming back!
Cat Noir::: I'm gonna switch back soon, hurry.
Ladybug::: Lucky Charm! 
Cat Noir::: Your... plumbing skill is gonna help us out? 
Cat Noir::: Could use a little work! Is that all you got? 
Ladybug::: Got it!Cat Noir, cover me! 
Cat Noir::: Go on! 
Ladybug::: Get out of there, you nasty bug. No more evil-doing for you, little akuma.Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! 
Nino::: Who? Dude.
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: Pound it!
Hawk Moth::: You can't run forever Ladybug and when I catch you, I will crush you! I will DESTROY YOU BOTH! 
Gabriel:::Nathalie? Did my son like his gift?
Nathalie::: Actually, I was going to check right away sir.
Gabriel::: Good. 
Nathalie:::A birthday present, from your father.
Adrien::: Thank you. I mean, please say thank you to my father for me. 
Chloé:::What do you mean not for a week?!
Sabrina:::There were no adults yesterday to deliver it.
Chloé::: So what? Ridiculous, utterly ridiculous! 
Alya:::Ha ha! Serves Chloé right.
Adrien::: Hey girls! 
Marinette:::Hey, that's my scarf! He's wearing my scarf.
Adrien:::Hey, dude.
Alya::: Yo, nice scarf, Adrien. Off the chain.
Adrien::: Yeah, can you believe my dad got this for me?He's so awesome. He's been giving me the same lame pen for three years in a row.
Nino::: Wow, I guess anyone can change. Adults can be cool when you least expect it.
Adrien::: Speaking of adults, I know my father said you were a bad influence, but
Nino::: We're good, Adrien, don't sweat it. We're buds. Always and forever.
Alya:::You gotta tell him you were the one who knitted the scarf.
Marinette::: But he seems so happy about his dad. I don't want to spoil it for him.
Alya::: Aw, Marinette.You're amazing, girl. You know that, right? And someday Adrien will figure it out too. Promise.
