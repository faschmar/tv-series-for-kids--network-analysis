Manon::: Mommy! I wanna go on the merry-go-round! Pretty please!
Nadja::: As many times as you like, sweetheart. It's Sunday!
Manon::: Yay!
Tikki::: When were paid holidays instituted in France?
Marinette::: Oh, Tikki. Please don't talk about holidays.
Tikki::: But it's for your history test tomorrow, Marinette.
Marinette::: Uh, okay. First paid holidays. Summer 1936.
Tikki::: Good job. Eh... you're drawing on a T-shirt right now.
Marinette::: Ah! 
Tikki::: Perhaps you should take a little break, Marinette.
Marinette::: I can't, Tikki. It's all due tomorrow! Tomorrow! To-morrow!
Tom:::Marinette! Ultimate Mecha Strike tournament time!
Marinette::: Video games? It's been so long since I last played video games. No! I can't give in! Dad, with the T-shirts for Jagged's new poster, I still have 72 hours worth of work left to fit in by tomorrow. And the rest of the week after that's even worse. I don't have a choice. I have to... stop playing.
Tom::: Stop playing? But Marinette, playing is like that little pinch of salt in baguettes. It makes life tastier.
Marinette::: Dad, I've got so many cakes baking in the oven right now, they're all on the verge of getting burned. No amount of salt is gonna fix this.
Tom::: Fine. That's too bad. But remember, watch your apple pie, sweetheart. It's bubbling all over your cinnamon flan. 
Tom::: Oh, why does she have to grow so fast?
Sabine::: It's a part of life.So, best of three do the laundry?
Tom::: Oh, you've got me! I know your secret! You've been practicing in secret!
Sabine::: Triple Cosmic Kick! Bam! Yes, I've got you!
Tom::: Oh no!
Tikki::: So... paid vacation was instituted to allow workers to...?
Marinette:::...take a break. Play video games.No!Found it! It really was just a dream. I filled it out. For real!Now I just need to finish the last Kitty Section T-shirts, review my English lessons, and color paint. 
Max:::It's for my new video game.
Marinette:::Ah, video games.Coloring the poster!
Lila::: Oh, I'd love to test your video game, Max, but I promised Prince Ali we'd go on a charity cruise over the Seine on his yacht this afternoon. Sorry.
Max::: Kim!
Kim::: Yeah?
Max::: Interested in playing the best fighting game in the world? 100% created by your best friend! 
Marinette::: A fighting game... he designed himself! Oh, what's wrong with me?
Kim::: I'm sure I'd get the highest score. But I've got swimming practice. Ondine's waiting for me.
Max::: Alix! You up for testing my game? I've included more than 50 characters and you can even loot their equipment. 
Marinette::: 50! Loot! Ah! No, no, no, no, no...
Alix::: No can do. I've got an in-line skate contest coming up. No winning without training.
Adrien::: Sorry, your game sounds amazing, but I've got fencing right now. Then my Chinese lesson, then a photoshoot...
Nathaniel::: A fighting game with former akumatized people? What do you say?
Marc::: The appointment with the editor is next week and we still have a lot of pages to finish.
Rose::: Oh, we'd gladly help you debug the game if it weren't for our costume fitting at Marinette's.
Max::: Ah, Marinette! The most skilled gamer in the whole class. We won the Ultimate Mecha Strike inter-school tournament together. Of course she won't say...
Marinette::: NO!
Max::: But, I haven't said anything yet!
Marinette::: And I don't want you to say it. Because then I wouldn't be able to refuse. And I have to resist! I've got too much to do today. A Kitty poster to sew for Jagged. I mean, a Jagged T-shirt for drawing Kitty. I mean, ah! 
Chloé::: What Dupain-Cheng is trying to tell you, using this ridiculously fake excuse of hers, is that she doesn't want to play your dumb, little video game. In fact, no one wants to, because everyone has a much more interesting life than you do. Even Marinette, which is really saying something.
Marinette::: No, this isn't a fake excuse at all. I really do have a Jagged poster to knit for Kitty. No! To post a Stone. Uh, to Stone a Jag. Uh... ah! I'm late! 
Max::: Ah, Markov! At least I can count on you.
Markov::: I'm sorry, Max. I'm currently connected to the world wide Artificial Intelligence Network. We're looking for a solution to the global warming crisis.
Max::: But, I need you to help me test my video game.
Markov::: Impossible! In order to optimize my results, I have eliminated all recreational activities from my system. 
Hawk Moth::: Oh, how depressing. All of his friends having such important and serious things to do. I, however, love a good game.And I've got all the time in the world. Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!
Hawk Moth:::Nice to see you again, Gamer 2.0. Our last little round felt a little incomplete. So, how about a rematch? I could give your game a whole new dimension. One thing hasn't changed, though. I'm only asking for one tiny reward. 
Max::: Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous. Game on! 
Roger::: One more ticket for... 
Adrien::: Something smells bad around here, Plagg.
Plagg::: Oh, could it be Brie? Reblochon? Camembert? Please tell me you smell Camembert!
Adrien::: No, I smell evil. Plagg, claws out! 
Marinette::: The last one! 
Gamer 2.0:::What do you do when no one wants to play with you? You give them no choice. 
Marinette::: Max?
Gamer 2.0::: Ladybug, Cat Noir. All of these people were once akumatized and then saved by you. If you want another chance at freeing them, you're going to have to come and play with me.
Tikki::: I think you're gonna have to take a break this time.
Marinette::: Then let's make it quick. I still have a lot to do.
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Yeah!
Cat Noir::: First one who finds a way in wins.
Ladybug::: We don't have time to play, Cat Noir. I've got a ton of other things to do. 
Gamer 2.0:::So, Ladybug and Cat Noir? Ready to play? Please enter your pyra-pod.
Cat Noir::: What if it's a trap, M'lady?
Ladybug::: No, I'm sure it's not. He just wants to play. So, let's keep in touch.
Cat Noir::: 
Gamer 2.0::: Take your pyra-pad.Welcome to playable characters) But if you lose...

Cat Noir::: Be careful! The Mime's object disappears if you talk.
Ladybug::: Thank you, Captain Obvious!
Ladybug::: Au revoir!

Ladybug::: I won, Gamer 2.0. Release us!
Gamer::: A game with just one round? Where's the fun in that, Ladybug? It doesn't end until you battled all the characters in the game.
Ladybug::: But this is gonna take forever!
Gamer 2.0::: That's the best part about it! The longer, the better!
Ladybug::: 
Cat Noir::: My turn! My turn! Frightningale, Stormy Weather — Awesome! But a little too awesome for a first battle. Oh, my copycat! Nah, I'd be too good as myself. That'd be too easy.
Ladybug:::Hurry up! Choose Copycat and Cataclysm this game away so we can get back home!
Cat Noir::: Fine. If we need to hurry this up. 
Ladybug::: You've got to be kidding me!
Cat Noir::: What? I've always wanted to train pigeons.
Gamer 2.0:::There aren't even any pigeons in this stadium!
Cat Noir::: There is one. And I'm gonna call him Fiery Phoenix. 
Ladybug::: 
Gamer 2.0::: More like Mega Flop Phoenix.It's gonna be the fastest victory ever!Ah! Get away, you flying rat! 
Cat Noir:::Double ankle grab and smash! Somersault bum drop!Feathered face wash!Volatile's Elbow! 
Game Voice::: Mr. Pigeon wins!
Cat Noir::: Pound it, Fiery Phoenix.
Gamer 2.0::: Impossible!
Ladybug::: Can we play the whole match in one go?

Ladybug::: If you ask me, this was never fun.

Ladybug::: this— 
Cat Noir::: game! 
Gamer 2.0::: May I remind you this is not just a game?
Cat Noir::: Hey, you're the one who wanted us to have fun.
Ladybug::: I think we're ready for the final boss. Stop hiding behind your toys and get in the ring, Gamer 2.0.
Gamer 2.0::: I am the final boss, but how are we going to figure out who should battle me?
Cat Noir::: What do you mean?
Gamer 2.0::: Well, I'm sure you'd agree that two against one would be very unfair, so the only way to know which one of you will take me on, is if you two fight... each other! 
Game Voice::: Ladybug. Cat Noir. Ready? Fight!
Gamer 2.0::: What are you waiting for? Start fighting! If you don't, everyone will be imprisoned forever!
Ladybug::: We can't let this happen...!
Cat Noir:::You know I love battling by your side, M'lady. But I could never bring myself to fight you. 
Ladybug::: Cat Noir... What are you doing? 
Cat Noir::: Giving you some extra time. 
Ladybug::: No! Cat Noir!
Cat Noir:::I trust you to bring me back, M'lady.
Game Voice::: Ring out! Ladybug wins!
Gamer 2.0::: You're the one who wanted to get this over with. Now, since this is the final battle, in addition to your own superpower, you get to pick four items from your inventory. Although, I wouldn't even bother if I were you, because I'm going to beat you no matter what. 
Ladybug::: You know what? Cat Noir's, right! I'm gonna take my sweet bug time. 
Gamer 2.0::: I'm happy you're enjoying the game.
Ladybug::: I'm going to enjoy winning this game! And by my rules! Lucky Charm! 
Gamer 2.0:::What a noob you are! Are you expecting to beat the creator of this game with a bag of flour?
Ladybug::: And a few other items. 
Gamer 2.0::: Given what you chose, in precisely one minute and thirty six seconds, you will lose.
Game Voice::: Ladybug. Gamer 2.0. Final fight!
Gamer 2.0::: I would've loved for it to last longer—but my statistics—are never wrong! 
Ladybug::: Did your statistics predict this? Cataclysm! 
Gamer 2.0::: What in the-?I am the game master!I can play any character. You thought you'd break me with that ridiculous little magic trick? Be a nice fairy and give me that Miraculous.What?Huh? That's not fair! So not fun!You're ruining the whole thing! 
Ladybug::: Oops! Sorry, aren't your hits having any effect? In chess, it's called a pat. A can't win, can't lose situation! What was it you said again? Oh, yeah! The longer, the better. 
Gamer 2.0:::It could've worked, if I didn't just have to wait for you to transform back!
Hawk Moth:::Checkmate, young Ladybug! Bested by your own game!
Gamer 2.0:::Cyclone!Who do you think you're fooling?
Gamer 2.0:::I won! You're out, Ladybug!No...! There's no way!
Ladybug::: I don't believe it!There's a bug in your game, Gamer!
Gamer 2.0::: No! That's impossible! 
Ladybug::: Even the best games by the best designers have bugs. 
Game Voice::: Ring out! Ladybug wins!
Ladybug::: But sometimes... they don't.
Gamer 2.0::: You got me. Good game. 
Ladybug:::Miraculous Ladybug!No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly.
Hawk Moth::: No more games, Ladybug. I'll get my revenge. When I do, you won't even remember the meaning of the word fun!
Ladybug::: Hey, Cat Noir, between being a superhero and everything else in your life, how do you manage to still have fun? Aren't you scared you'll eventually have to sacrifice everything you love for all of this?
Cat Noir::: The times when I have the most fun, my favorite moments, are when I'm with you, M'lady. And I would give up everything for just that. 
Marinette::: Mom? Dad? I know I don't have time to play with you guys these days... but, Max does! And he has a video game he designed which he needs to test! With tons of bugs in it!
Tom::: A video game? He made himself?
Sabine::: With bugs to find?
Tom::: To the living room! 
Sabine::: To the living room!
Marinette::: Tikki, I'm almost done with the T-shirts, and Jagged's poster can wait a bit longer, can't it?
Tikki::: It sure can, Marinette.
Marinette::: Leave a few bugs for me! Here I come!
