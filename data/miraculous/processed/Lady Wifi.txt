Miss Bustier::: I'm very pleased with how you all did on your last assignment. Some of you have really stepped up, and I do appreciate it. Now it's time to move on to our next assignment.Is Marinette still in the girls' room?
Alya::: Uh, I don't know, miss. 
Miss Bustier::: Tonight I want you all to read chapter three of the breathtaking France, the First Thousand Years. Then, answer this simple questionnaire.See to it that Marinette receives her homework.
Marinette:::It's Marinette, leave a message. Beep! He he.
Alya::: Marinette?
Alya::: Uhh, have you guys seen Marinette anywhere? 
Alya:::Chloé's Ladybug?
Alya::: Hey, Marinette. Ring me ASAP. We gotta talk.Nino, wait!
Nino::: Yeah?
Alya::: Come with me, I need your help!
Nino::: So 
Marinette:::It's Marinette, leave a message. Beep! He he.
Alya::: Ughh. I hate when she goes AWOL. She's not calling me back! Where is that girl?!
Nino::: Seriously. My man Adrien's the exact same way. But I guess you gotta be sly when Mr. Control Freak is your daddy-o.
Nadja::: Once again, Ladybug and Cat Noir have saved Paris from the clutches of a menacing villain.
Alya::: Hey! I think I've just sniffed out who the real Ladybug is!Chloé.
Nino:::Chloé? Seriously? She's too self-absorbed to think of anyone but herself, much less save the world. You are cray-cray, lady!
Alya::: I am so not! You'll see!
Tikki::: Time flies fast when you're saving the world. Day's already over!
Marinette::: Tell me about it. I missed an entire half day of school AND half day of seeing Adrien!
Tikki::: Whoever's behind all of this sure is keeping us on our toes!
Marinette:::You don't have any toes!
Sabine::: Alya brought your school bag home for you, Marinette.
Marinette::: Hey mom...
Sabine::: You seem so forgetful these days. Maybe you just need some fresh air and extra exercise for that growing brain of yours!
Marinette::: Good idea, mom. I'll start tomorrow. 
Marinette::: Ladybug saved Paris from destruction once again, but who's gonna save Marinette from her homework?What's this? Call me. I know who the real Ladybug is?
Tikki::: No way! You think she knows?
Marinette::: I doubt it. Alya's always jumping to conclusions before she has her facts straight.
Tikki::: But just in case...
Marinette::: No worries Tikki. I got it covered.
Marinette::: Dang. No signal.
Civilian::: Sorry, miss. Cell tower maintenance. The whole neighborhood's down. No signal for the next hour!
Tikki::: Come on, Marinette. Try again later. Let's head down and finish your homework.
Chloé::: Hey there! Hi! You look totally fab! Uh, no, not you. Hey, it's still a month from Halloween, you know?
Nino::: You need to have your head examined. If she's a superhero, then I'm the Wizard of Oz.
Alya::: I'm telling you, she's Ladybug!
Nino::: Can you prove it?
Tikki::: Uh... what time is it?
Marinette::: Uhh, school starts in...An hour ago?!
Alya::: Now don't mess up your lines. 
Nino:::Oh, uhhh... Ladybug! Look over there!
Chloé::: Uhh, what kind of lame joke is this?
Nino::: Uhh, well, that was... Did you see Ladybug yesterday? Isn't she amazing? I wonder who she really is.
Chloé::: Uhh... up too late DJ-ing, Nino? Obviously you didn't get your beauty sleep.
Sabrina::: Uh... Chloé! Alya's looking in your locker!
Alya::: Uhh... that's a lie! I so was not! 
Alya::: Hey! Give it back!
Chloé:::Who's the little liar now?
Chloé::: She's guilty of invasion of privacy! I have proof!
Alya::: What?! Seriously! All I did was take a measly photo!
Mr. Damocles::: I'm sorry, Chloé. But there's no school policy on invasion of privacy.
Chloé::: Then... then breaking and entering!
Alya::: I didn't break into her locker! It was open!
Mr. Damocles::: And nothing was stolen?
Chloé::: Only my very soul! My locker is my secret garden! He who enters uninvited burglarizes my inner being and steals my life force! 
Mr. Damocles::: Right. An hour of detention for you, Alya.
Chloé::: Are my ears failing me? Did I hear you're giving one miserable hour of detention to a... a heinous criminal? Sabrina!
Sabrina::: The school rules clearly state that any student guilty of theft should be suspended for one full week.
Mr. Damocles::: Yes, but she's hardly stole anything.
Chloé::: I'm not sure that my father would share your point of view. 
Mr. Damocles::: Uhhh, well, now, Chloé, let's not bother your father, I mean, the honorable Mayor with a minor locker situation...
Mr. Damocles::: Ehhh... what I mean is, you're suspended for a week, Alya.
Alya::: What?! That is so unfair! I am so gonna protest this on the school blog!
Mr. Damocles:::The school blog is hereby suspended as well.
Alya:::She's no superhero, she's super-psycho!
Hawk Moth::: Ahhh... School life. Such a science experiment. A petri dish of cultivating secrets, lies and betrayal, the thriving vivarium for my evil akumas.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her!
Marinette::: I'm late, I'm late, I'm so, so late!
Marinette:::It's Marinette, leave a message. Beep! He he!
Hawk Moth::: Lady Wifi, I heard through the grapevine that you're seeking to unmask Ladybug... I'd like to help you if you agree to help me too.
Alya::: I'll expose the lies of anyone who covers up the truth! Sign me up! 
Marinette:::Where is she?
Nino::: She's been suspended...
Marinette::: What?!
Miss Bustier::: Marinette, if you're going to come late, would you please do it discretely?
Marinette::: Sorry...What happened to her?
Nino::: The short story? Accused of breaking into Chloé's locker. I mean, Ladybug's locker...
Marinette:::WHAT?!?
Miss Bustier::: That's it, Marinette! Go to the principal's office!
Adrien:::What are you talking about?
Nino::: Exactly what I said, bro. Alya says Chloé is Ladybug! She is crazy!
Marinette:::Mr. Damocles?Sir?Huh?!
Lady Wifi::: I'm Lady Wifi, revealer of the truth! For our first exposé, your principal would like to share a little tidbit with you. So, Mr. Damocles, is it true you wrongly suspended a student named Alya today?
Mr. Damocles:::Uh... yes, it is.
Lady Wifi::: So, you were biased? Unfair? Totally unjust?!
Mr. Damocles::: Yes, I was.
Marinette::: Oh, no! Alya! Tikki, time to transform!
Tikki::: You're going to have to fight your best friend!
Marinette::: Nope! I'm gonna have to save my best friend!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Yeah!
Lady Wifi::: For my next scoop, I'll be taking you to meet the girl who's been hiding behind the Ladybug mask!Stay connected! 
Miss Bustier::: Everyone, for your own safety, go directly home right now! And don't forget to read chapters four and five! 
Adrien::: If Chloé is Ladybug like Alya said, then Lady Wifi's gonna head straight for her house!
Plagg:::And it also means you must have a crush on Chloé! 
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Cat Noir::: What? This can't be!
Ladybug::: Who's being a sneaky kitty now?
Cat Noir::: Oh, Ladybug. But
Ladybug::: Come on, you don't actually believe she's the real Ladybug.
Cat Noir::: Yeah, of course not.
Ladybug::: And besides, who would believe that she's the original Ladybug? She's obviously just a die-hard fan. A copycat?
Cat Noir::: Right.
Chloé:::Hello? 
Lady Wifi::: Well, hello there, Ladybug! 
Ladybug::: We got Wifi! 
Lady Wifi:::Well, well... So my hunch was correct in window.Everyone thinks the girl beneath the Ladybug costume is a little angel. Think again, people! The real Ladybug is... Chloé Bourgeois, everyone!Who are you?
Cat Noir::: Uhhh...
Lady Wifi:::But I thought you were Ladybug!
Cat Noir::: Sorry to bust your news story. Next time, double-check your facts.
Lady Wifi::: You'll be sorry. 
Ladybug::: Alya?
Lady Wifi::: Alya's been disconnected. I'm Lady Wifi. News flash! Ladybug, let's find out who you really are!
Ladybug::: Follow me!
Cat Noir::: So what's the plan?
Ladybug::: She gets her powers from her phone, so let's lead her to the basement, where there is no service!
Cat Noir::: No service, no power. Nice one, my lady!
Ladybug::: We've gotta go lower!
Lady Wifi:::I've got you now, Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Get ready!
Cat Noir::: So, what do you do when you're not Ladybug?
Ladybug:::Can't you see we're a little bit busy right now?She's gone back into the hotel!
Cat Noir:::She locked all the doors! Hey, you realize we might actually know each other in normal life.
Ladybug::: Doubt it. It's locked!
Cat Noir::: She's left this one open.
Ladybug::: Get ready for an ambush on 3. 1, 2, 3!
Cat Noir::: Ahhh... So much for the ambush.
Ladybug::: Follow me. Where is she hiding? And what's up with all these phones?
Cat Noir::: How now, brown cow? I thought it was you she was after!
Lady Wifi::: Ha! You can't get me!
Ladybug::: Yes I can. 
Cat Noir::: No, no, no... Hold on in there, Ladybug!Of course! The service elevator!
Lady Wifi:::Who is Ladybug? Is she a superhero or a super-weirdo? How can we trust the girl when we have no idea who she really is? We have the right to know!Why doesn't it come off?
Ladybug::: Uhhh... because it's magic?
Cat Noir::: You're out of minutes, Lady Wifi!
Lady Wifi::: Oh, how romantic. Tomcat's come to save his love bug.
Ladybug::: I am not his love bug!
Cat Noir::: We'll come back to that later.
Adrien::: My ring!
Plagg::: Ooh... so chilly in here.
Adrien::: Where is it? I could use a little help!
Lady Wifi::: Well, well... what am I gonna do with both of you?
Hawk Moth::: Get her to use her Lucky Charm! It'll force her to switch back, and her identity will be revealed, and her Miraculous will be mine.
Lady Wifi::: If you don't get him outta there fast, your crush will soon be slush. Ha ha ha!Good luck with your cat popsicle! I have other news to cover! 
Ladybug::: Huh?
André::: Come on...
Lady Wifi::: What's up, peeps! Listen everyone! I present you with the award-winning news story you've all been waiting for!
Ladybug::: I'll get you out of there, Cat Noir! 
Adrien::: Take your time!
Lady Wifi:::Don't blink, 'cause Ladybug's about to drop the bomb on her real identity!
Ladybug::: box appears) This better be some lucky box... Of course, the microwaves! 
Adrien:::Gotcha! Gotcha!
Ladybug::: Come on, micro-thingies, jam this signal...
Ladybug::: You okay, Cat Noir? 
Lady Wifi::: Exactly!
Cat Noir::: Open the kitchen door!
Ladybug::: We can't, microwave's busted.Here's what to do, listen to me...
Cat Noir::: Got it.
Lady Wifi::: What is she up to?
Hawk Moth::: Don't let my Miraculous get away!
Lady Wifi::: Right!
Cat Noir:::I'll go and jam the wi-fi antenna.
Ladybug::: Good luck!
Cat Noir:::Here you are! Cataclysm!
Lady Wifi::: Nice idea, kitty cat, but I'm not gonna let you cut me off so easily! 
Ladybug:::Hurry, Cat Noir...
Lady Wifi::: Nooooo!
Lady Wifi::: Lost the signal!
Cat Noir::: Gimme that phone!
Ladybug:::No more evildoing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! 
Alya::: What?
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: Pound it!
Alya::: Ladybug! Wow! And Cat Noir! Can I get a quick interview? Just let me grab my phone!
Cat Noir:::Uhh... gotta go. You've only got a minute.
Alya::: So oh, no! Where did they go?
Cat Noir::: Stay!I won't tell anyone who you are. Cat's honor.
Ladybug::: Nobody must know who we really are. Not even us. 
Tikki::: Phew, that was too close for comfort!
Marinette::: Tell me about it. 
Plagg::: That was the chance to find out who the love of your life really is! What were you thinking?
Adrien::: That's the thing, Plagg. I wasn't thinking. I was following my heart.
Hawk Moth::: Your mask will fall one day, Ladybug. You'll have no choice then but to hand over your precious Miraculous! 
Tikki::: Is that true? You're gonna tell him? Is that what your heart's saying?
Marinette::: Sometimes your heart tells you one thing, but a great superhero always listens to her head.
Alya::: Got it!
Marinette::: Waaahhh!
Alya::: Wanna see my new smartphone? It puts my old phone to shame! Just look at these pics!
Marinette::: Huh? What's with all these photos of Adrien?
Alya::: Well... with a mask and a costume, don't you think he looks a little bit like Cat Noir?
Marinette::: Are you out of your mind? He's tons more legit than Cat Noir!
Alya::: Hey! I happened to think that Cat Noir is pretty slick.
Marinette::: Anyway, stop taking photos of Adrien. Well, unless you give them to me, afterwards. 
Alya::: Give it back! 
Marinette::: Nope!
Alya::: Oh, come on, Marinette! What if you drop it? Everyone knows how clumsy you are!
