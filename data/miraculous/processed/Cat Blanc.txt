Gabriel::: Emilie, I miss you every moment. But one day, I will get the Miraculous of Ladybug and Cat Noir, repair the mistakes of the past, and make sure you return to us.
Alya::: Today's the day, I can feel it! 
Alix::: Bet you my skates she won't do it.
Rose::: And I'll bet my favorite unicorn plush that she will!
Mylène::: Oh, Marinette.
Alya, Rose, and Juleka:::What?Aw...
Marinette::: I was thinking maybe Adrien doesn't like berets, or what if he hates it when people celebrate his fifth name's day? Or... maybe he wouldn't want to know that I love him?
Alix:::Don't worry, Princess Twinkle Peach will be happy with me.
Alya::: The only way you'll know is to tell him how you really feel!
Marinette::: I know, but... 
Rose::: That's it, Marinette! No more picnics, sleepovers, or going to the movies with us until you give him that gift! You made that hat for Saint Athanasius Day, which is today! How is Adrien's supposed to know you're thinking of him on his fifth name's day if you don't give him your gift?
Alya::: She's right. Today is the day!
All the girls except Marinette::: Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Mylène::: Rise and shine! Behold, the goddess of self-confidence has awakened!
Alya::: And don't forget the card!
Tikki::: Are you really gonna do this?
Marinette::: I am, Tikki, and you know what I won't take for an answer?
Nathalie:::No.
Marinette::: Okay, well, um... Uh, when will he be back?
Nathalie:::I can't tell you. Goodbye, young lady. 
Marinette:::But Adrien's fencing class ended 27 minutes ago! He should be back by now!
Tikki::: Maybe you can give him his present tomorrow at school?
Marinette::: No. You heard what Rose said. I can't back out again.Since he's not back yet, I can go through the window!
Tikki::: Oh, no no no! You know it's not a good idea to use your powers for personal reasons.
Marinette::: I'll be quick, Tikki, no one will ever know! 
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on!
Ladybug:::Adrien's trophies... Adrien's basketball hoop... Adrien's foosball table...Adrien's desk... Adrien's video games...Adrien's bed...
Nathalie::: You're very late, Adrien.
Adrien:::The awards ceremony took longer than expected. Then we gave Kagami a ride home.Will you let my father know I won?
Nathalie::: As soon as he's done with his work.
Ladybug:::Adrien's scent...Adrien's present!The card, I forgot the card! Uh...This should do. Signed, Marinette. 
Adrien::: Ladybug?Why would Ladybug leave me a gift from Marinette? And with a heart embroidered on it?
Plagg::: Uh well, it's obvious because Marinette asked her to!
Adrien::: Or because... Ladybug and Marinette are the same person! 
Ladybug::: You're my friend, and I'd never want to lie to a friend.
Cat Noir::: But why do you think you'd be lying?
Ladybug::: 'Cause... there's this Boy, I...
Adrien::: Me!
Plagg::: No, no, no, no!It doesn't make any sense, Marinette is Marinette and Ladybug is—
Adrien::: Marinette! 
Plagg::: Okay Adrien, this whole thing smells like rotten cheese. You know you aren't supposed to know each other's secret identities!
Adrien::: Just because I know her secret identity doesn't mean she has to know about mine. Everything will be just fine, I promise. 
Plagg::: Adrien! Putting a smelly piece of cheese in a box doesn't stop it from smelling!
Ladybug::: Bunnyx?
Bunnyx::: Minibug, something happened today that caused a major disaster in the future. I'm not sure what it was or when it happened exactly. Nothing unusual to report on your side?
Ladybug::: Uh...
Bunnyx::: Think, Minibug, think!
Ladybug::: Uh... no?
Bunnyx::: Ugh! In my burrow, now! 
Ladybug::: Wow, it's a lot bigger on the inside!
Ladybug::: What's that for?
Bunnyx::: You wanna know what you're getting for your next birthday?
Ladybug::: No, of course not.
Bunnyx::: Exactly.
Ladybug::: What about you? You know about all your birthday presents?
Bunnyx::: I know about... some of them.Normally, we have to avoid interfering with past or present events as much as possible, but this is really serious, Minibug.Our future is in danger! I need your help. 
Ladybug::: What happened here?
Bunnyx::: The less you know about the future, the better. Just do your thing: capture the Akuma and restore order. Then, the train will be back on track.
Ladybug::: You're not staying?
Bunnyx::: Let's say I gotta stand ready to jump back into time and try something else, in case you fail. Mwah! 
Cat Blanc:::Little kitty on a roof...
Ladybug::: Cat... Noir?
Cat Blanc:::...all alone without his lady.
Ladybug::: Cat Noir.
Cat Blanc:::M'lady? I thought I'd lost you!Oh, I was feline so sad that you were gone!
Ladybug:::What's happened to you? No, don't tell me. We're gonna fix everything!
Cat Blanc::: Of course we're gonna fix everything!Now that you're back and now that you're going to...GIVE ME YOUR MIRACULOUS!
Ladybug:::My Miraculous? What's wrong with you, Cat Noir?
Cat Blanc::: Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude, m'lady. Could you please hand me your Miraculous, please? Cat Blanc has... gotten into some mischief.
Ladybug::: You've been akumatized, Cat Noir.You don't need my Miraculous, you need me to de-evilise you. Let me help you. 
Cat Blanc:::Save me...
Ladybug:::My poor kitty... tell me,do you remember where the Akuma went? 
Cat Blanc:::Here! But it's already broken! 
Cat Blanc::: NOW YOU'RE BREAKING MORE THAN MY HEART, MARINETTE!!!
Ladybug:::What?!What did you say?
Cat Blanc::: Give me a hug... MARINETTE!!!! 
Ladybug::: You're wrong! I'm not Marinette!It's impossible, I never told you anything!'
Adrien:::Ladybug?
Bunnyx::: Oh, no, what have you done, Marinette?! 
Marinette:::Ta-da, I did it!
Alya::: I'm so proud of you.
Mylène::: You rock!
Bunnyx::: How is this possible? That's not what I remember! 
Alya::: So how did you get to Adrien?
Marinette::: I... I was very convincing?
Adrien::: Marinette! 
Adrien::: I have something to tell you.
Adrien::: I've realized... I've realized that you're not just a friend to me. I’ve always felt like you were more than that.And now I know why. 
Alya, Rose, Juleka, and Mylène::: Ohhh?
Marinette::: Does that... does this mean that you... you like the beret?
Adrien:::It means that I love you.
Bunnyx::: It’s worse than I thought. Come on, Ladybug, quick!
Cat Blanc::: Give me your Miraculous so I can make everything go back to the way it was!! MEGA-CATACLYSM!!!!! 
Bunnyx:::Oh no, what happened?! 
Chloé:::Ridiculous, utterly ridiculous! 
Nadja::: It's heartbreak for all the girls of Paris as supermodel Adrien Agreste has a girlfriend—classmate Marinette Dupain-Cheng.
Bunnyx::: You have to succeed, Ladybug. Capture his Akuma, do it now!
Cat Blanc::: Things were PURR-FECT until Hawk Moth found out about everything. Once the cat is out of the bag, it's only a matter of time 'till everyone knows. It was our love that did this to the world, m'lady.
Bunnyx::: But how did it?
Gabriel:::Miss Dupain-Cheng, your relationship with my son is detrimental to the Gabriel brand. I demand that you stop seeing him at once.
Marinette::: But... I didn’t do anything.
Tom::: She loves Adrien and Adrien loves her! You can’t stop them—
Gabriel:::If you refuse, I will not hesitate to withdraw Adrien from school, and he will never see his friends again.
Marinette:::Adrien doesn't deserve this!
Gabriel:::Then make the right choice.
Tom:::Get out of my bakery! Now!
Adrien::: Marinette? Why won't you come in? What's wrong?
Marinette::: Adrien... I... forgive me, we're just... we're just not right for each other.
Adrien::: What are you talking about? Of course we are, we love each other!
Marinette::: No. I don't love you... anymore! 
Adrien::: No... Marinette!Please let me through, it can't end like this! It can't end at all! I love her!
Nathalie:::Everything is going as planned, sir.
Hawk Moth::: I've never felt such utter despair!Marinette Dupain-Cheng will be my ultimate masterpiece! Fly away, my beautiful Akuma, and evilise this broken heart! 
Adrien:::I beg you, please!
Adrien:::Marinette, move!
Marinette::: Adrien? 
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out! 
Cat Noir::: CATACLYSM! 
Marinette::: Adrien!
Cat Noir::: You were about to be akumatized. I didn't have a choice, m'lady.
Marinette::: M'lady? But how did you know? I thought our identities were supposed to remain a secret! 
Cat Noir::: Everything will be okay, I promise.
Hawk Moth:::Nathalie? Nathalie!
Nathalie:::It's Adrien. Your son... he's... he's Cat Noir.
Hawk Moth:::Cat Noir, my own son?The Miraculous will soon be mine!
Bunnyx:::Hurry up!
Cat Blanc::: I'll find you, m'lady!! And when I do, you'll give me your Miraculous!
Ladybug:::Time to de-evil—! 
Cat Blanc::: Looking for my Akuma, m'lady?!There’s a faster way to make this end, you know. You just need to hand over.. YOUR MIRACULOUS!!!!!!!
Ladybug::: Never! Lucky Charm!!
Cat Blanc::: An eraser? I'd like to erase the past too, but there's only one way to do that.You know that by merging our Miraculous together, we'd be granted one wish, right? Any wish we wanted. Well, my wish would be to fix everything, so we could be in love again. And have a hamster, too. You’ve always dreamed of having one. We’ll call it— 
Ladybug:::Time to de-evil—
Cat Blanc:::You're not even listening. You don't understand.
Ladybug::: You're done, Hawk Moth! Give us back your Miraculous!
Cat Noir:::You know what they say. The wave of a moth's wing can set off a CATACLYSM! 
Hawk Moth::: I would put that Cataclysm away if I were you... Adrien.
Cat Noir::: How do you—Mother?
Hawk Moth::: I'm doing it for her, Adrien. For you. For us.
Cat Noir::: Father?Why? Why? Why?Why...?
Hawk Moth::: We can save your mother using your Miraculous and hers!
Cat Noir::: No, just stop!
Ladybug:::Don't listen to him! You know there'd be a terrible price to pay in exchange! 
Hawk Moth::: If she really loved you, she'd let you save your mother! 
Cat Noir::: Stop it! Stop it! STOP IT!!!!!
Hawk Moth::: Cat Blanc, I'm giving you the infinite power of destruction! Together you and I will seize Ladybug's Miraculous and awaken your mother! Obey!
Cat Noir:::I'm sorry, Ladybug!
Hawk Moth::: Seize her Miraculous, my son! 
Ladybug::: No Adrien, you have to resist!
Hawk Moth::: How dare you! Not me, Adrien!
Cat Blanc::: I... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!!!!!
Cat Blanc::: M'lady...
Ladybug:::My prince..
Bunnyx::: Fix this nightmare, Ladybug! Please!
Ladybug:::What did you do to them?!
Cat Blanc::: I didn't mean to.Why won't you try and help me fix it?!The simple truth is you don't love me anymore!! So I might as well destroy YOU, ME, OUR MEMORIES... EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!
Ladybug::: NO!!!!!!!
Bunnyx:::No, no, no, NO! He's about to trigger the end of the world, Ladybug!!
Ladybug:::OKAY! OKAY! I'LL GIVE YOU MY MIRACULOUS, CAT NOIR!
Cat Blanc::: I'm not Cat Noir anymore.I'm Cat Blanc. 
Ladybug::: You will always be Cat Noir to me.
Ladybug::: No more evildoing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilise Cat Noir!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little butterfly. 
Bunnyx:::Yes, yes! You did it, Minibug! 
Cat Noir::: Marinette, what happened?What's wrong? 
Ladybug::: You're still calling me Marinette. You're not supposed to know who I am. It means that if I use my Miraculous Ladybug to fix everything now...
Bunnyx::: You'll still have this memory of her.
Ladybug:::Of course!I'm gonna fix everything, Cat Noir, I promise!
Cat Noir:::I know.
Ladybug:::Bring me back 10 minutes before the moment you came to get me, quick! I don't have much time before I transform back and lose my Lucky Charm.I have to erase my mistake to get things back to normal. This future is a result from something that happened in the past. I must not throw my eraser here and now, I must throw my eraser back then!
Bunnyx::: Do you know how Cat Noir found out about your secret identity?
Ladybug::: I think so. When I went into Adrien's house as Ladybug, he probably saw me. He figured out that Ladybug is Marinette because of the note written on the gift. But I'm not sure what happened next. 
Bunnyx::: He probably told his friend Nino, who told Alya, who wrote about it on the Ladyblog.
Ladybug::: Mm.. They would never do that. But Adrien probably told someone, who told someone else, and so on, until it was all over the news! The best-kept secrets are the ones you never share.
Ladybug from 10 minutes::: Signed, Marinette.What the—
Ladybug:::Trust me, it's better this way.Miraculous Ladybug! 
Bunnyx:::WOO-HOO!
Adrien:::Ladybug?
Ladybug::: Oh, Adrien Agreste! What a surprise! I brought you a gift from... your fan club in Brazil! There's a postal strike over there but they really wanted it to arrive today for Saint Athanasius Day.
Adrien:::That's my... fifth name.
Ladybug::: Wow, they must be serious fans to know that about you! Well, happy Fifth Name's Day! 
Adrien::: Uh... thank you. 
Plagg::: Ugh, why would anyone send a beret when they could send cheese instead?
Ladybug::: Hey, Bunnyx, when you travel through time, do you forget what happened when you're done?
Bunnyx::: What's seen can't be unseen. I know who you are, Minibug, and a few other things too. 
Ladybug::: Do you know who Hawk Moth is?
Bunnyx::: Even if I did, I couldn't tell you. There's a time for everything and time is a fragile thing. That's the reason you picked me, Minibug. I know how to keep a secret. 
Marinette::: He wasn't home. His fencing competition probably ended later than expected. 
Alya::: What did you do with the gift?
Marinette::: Oh, I dropped it off at home before coming back here. I was gonna tell you that I've given it to him but the truth is I just couldn't do it! But I promise next time, it'll work. You know what they say, 563rd time's a charm! 
Cat Noir:::Little kitty on a roof, all alone without his lady...
Cat Noir::: Hey, Bugaboo. So what was that sudden call for?
Ladybug::: I did it. 
Cat Noir:::I have no idea what you're talking about, but I'm perfectly fine with it.
