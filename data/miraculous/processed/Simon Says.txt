Alec::: Welcome back to everyone's #1 live game show: The Challenge! Let's give it up for our awesome contestant, Nino!
Alec::: So Nino, you're a student and a DJ. That's pretty awesome! Check out the decks we got for you!
Marinette::: Grounded? For what?!
Tom::: Let's jog your memory, Marinette. Monday morning, absent from P.E...
Marinette::: I was in study hall.
Tom::: Friday evening, absent from study hall.
Marinette::: I was at P.E.!
Tom::: You're never where you're supposed to be, Marinette! The only way we can keep track of you is by keeping you here, grounded.
Marinette::: But I was invited... Nino is my friend, he was counting on me.
Alec::: So, the challenge the viewers have chosen for you is... To get the mayor of Paris, André Bourgeois, to dance! Thank you for agreeing to play with us today, sir. What are Nino's chances tonight?
André:::Zero. I despise dancing. The last time I set foot on a dance floor, Madonna was in kindergarten.
Tom::: I know Nino's your friend. But until your unexcused absences come to an end, that's the way it's going to be.
Marinette::: Awesome. 
Tikki::: Can you blame them? How are they supposed to know that you're missing class to save the world?
Marinette:::I guess being grounded comes with the territory of being a top secret superhero. Doesn't seem fair though.
Tikki::: It's not. But hey, if Nino wins, you're not grounded next week. You can go see him at the show!
Marinette::: Yeah, but Adrien was there today! 
Hawk Moth:::The Challenge... what an interesting concept. A TV show with such potential with negative emotions. Oh, the destructive mayhem we could cause...
Marinette::: Seriously? How can you say that, Alya?
Alya::: Sorry, but I kinda get your dad, Marinette. You're never where you say you'll be. Showing up late, splitting mysteriously and all. I'd almost suspect you were leading...a double life.
Marinette:::Gimme a break! You're being ridiculous.
Adrien:::No! It's okay!
Alec::: Victory! Challenge conquered by Nino. You moved your head to the beat, Mayor Bourgeois! That counts as dancing!
André Bourgeois:::What?! That's not true! My neck was... itching, that's all.
Alec::: Relieving an itch to the beat counts as dancing, too! Nino, congratulations. You'll return in one week to meet your next challenge! And now, for our next contestant, welcome Simon Grimault!
Adrien:::Awesome, dude!
Alec::: Mr. Grimault, you are a hypnotist. You use cards to hypnotize people to get what you want from them!
Simon::: Well, yes, I'm a hypnotist. But, uh, I don't use my skills to get anything.
Alec::: So, your challenge today, Simon, is to use your talents to bring a very elusive celebrity to this very TV set! Give it up for the king of fashion, Gabriel!
Gabriel::: What is this show? I was told this was an interview.
Nino::: Dude, your dad!
Alec::: Do your thing, Grimault, let's see if you can bring Mr. Agreste here with your hypnotic persuasion!
Simon::: I told you, I don't make people
Alec::: Ha! A shy hypnotist! How funny is that, Gabriel?
Gabriel::: Hilarious. Your show is pathetic. And so is your contestant. Control me? Never. 
Alec::: Huh?
Adrien::: That's my dad, all right.
Alec::: Looks like Mr. Agreste has turned on your challenge. Game over!
Simon::: But... that's not fair! I didn't even get time to... 
Hawk Moth::: Yes. Humiliation and anger. The perfect elements for transforming a loser into a winner.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!
Hawk Moth::: I am Hawk Moth. You are now Simon Says. I will help you be the most powerful hypnotist ever. You will help me in return when the time's right. So, do we have a deal, Simon Says?
Simon::: Simon says yes. 
Simon Says::: Simon says the show is not over!
Alec::: What on earth?!
Simon Says:::Silence! Silence saysyou're lame! As lame as a duck!
Simon Says::: Simon says stop!Simon says you are a Gorilla! 
Tikki::: Marinette, look!
Marinette:::Ah! I gotta go, Alya!
Alya:::Have a good one! I'll get back to my babysitting.
Marinette::: Tikki, what am I gonna do? I'm grounded!
Tikki::: You don't have a choice! You must transform! We just have to be extra careful! Use that pillow under your sheets.
Tikki::: Lookin' good.
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Simon Says::: Gabriel turned down my challenge and he will pay for it! By midnight tonight, he will entertain us in this very TV studio. Gabriel, I'm coming to get you!
Cat Noir::: Dad?
Hawk Moth:::It's risky, but it's given me an idea. Good luck, Simon Says.
Cat Noir::: Cat Noir says: Zip it and gimme those cards!
Simon Says:::My gorilla will take care of you. Simon says.. knock him out! 
Cat Noir::: I may not always land on my feet, but I always bounce back!
Simon Says:::I could use an army.
Simon Says::: Simon says... you are all soldiers!Simon says... search all over Paris, my army, and find Gabriel!
Cat Noir::: Better watch out. My sensei taught me that...size doesn't matter!
Nino::: Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Oh... Hey! You okay?
Nino::: I'm fine, but my Boy Adrien's still here somewhere!
Ladybug::: Don't worry, we'll find him.
Cat Noir::: I quit karate.Oh, hey there, Ladybug!
Cat Noir::: Enough already. Cataclysm! 
Ladybug::: Nice seeing you too, Cat Noir.
Cat Noir::: Oh, sorry. I thought you were Simon Says.
Nino::: I saw him! He's got a whole army together!
Cat Noir::: He's looking for Gabriel. We better get to him faster then they can! 
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, you're about to change back. I'll take one last look around for Nino's friend.
Cat Noir::: Uh... Forget it. He's probably hypnotized.
Nino::: But he's my buddy!
Cat Noir::: Uh... you're right. Maybe he's hiding. I'll leave you to look for him. Let's meet up at Gabriel's place later on.Finding Adrien will be a piece of cake! 
Adrien::: Plagg, hide.Nino!
Nino::: Adrien! Dude, you okay?
Adrien::: I'm fine....Hello?
Ladybug::: Uh... Hello! You sure you're okay?
Adrien::: I'm fine, really. But we've got to get to my house now! My father's in danger!
Ladybug::: Let's go. Cat Noir will meet us there.
Adrien::: Nathalie, where's my father? He's in danger!
Nathalie::: He knows already.
Gabriel::: Good evening, Ladybug.
Adrien::: Father, you've gotta get outta here. The hypnotist Simon Says is coming after you!
Gabriel::: What? And be dictated by a madman? Certainly not.
Adrien::: But father, he's dangerous! Who knows what he'll do?
Gabriel::: Head up to your room now. You've had enough excitement for today. Nathalie, make sure they stay there. I have to apologize for my son, Ladybug. He's like his mother. Way too overly dramatic.
Ladybug:::But he's right, you know. Simon Says is a real threat. You're in a lot of danger!
Gabriel::: What could possibly happen with you here to protect me?
Nino::: You sure your old man isn't some robot or something?
Adrien::: When my father's concerned I'm never sure of anything. 
Nino::: Hoho! Dude! I've seen stadiums tinier than your room!
Adrien::: Make yourself at home. I'm gonna take a shower.
Nino::: Now?!
Adrien::: What can I say? It's the model in me!Why doesn't my father ever listen to me?
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Gabriel::: Isn't he flawless?
Ladybug::: Huh? What? Flaw-what?
Gabriel::: Adrien, my son. He's the image of perfection, don't you think?
Ladybug::: Oh, yes, he's perfect. I mean, um, I don't know him very well, but he seems...
Gabriel::: I've never noticed your earrings before. They really are quite unique. May I? 
Ladybug::: Excuse me.Cat Noir, where were you?
Cat Noir::: I, I was... keeping Simon Says at bay!
Ladybug::: And? Cat Noir?
Cat Noir:::I couldn't keep him away. He's coming. He's got company.Close off all exits! They're coming from another direction! Do as I say! Engage the self-defense system, we need total lockdown! 
Announcer::: Lockdown engaged.
Gabriel::: How do you know so much about the system?
Cat Noir::: Uh... In a house like this... it's a given!
Gabriel::: They won't get in. This house is built like a fortress.
Simon Says::: Simon says, destroy! 
Announcer::: Emergency power on.
Cat Noir::: There are too many of them. Your defense system is failing!
Ladybug::: Adrien and Nino! I better go get them!
Gabriel::: Here, Nathalie. Pick the controls in case you need to unlock an exit. She's coming with you.
Cat Noir::: I'll reinforce the outer defenses. Go hide in the atrium. It's not safe in here.
Gabriel::: No one tells me what to do. Not even a super.
Cat Noir::: You're in danger, like everyone else!So stop pretending you're above us all, just do what I tell you to!
Gabriel::: Quite a temper. You remind me of someone.
Hawk Moth::: I don't think that's a good idea, Simon Says.
Simon Says::: Gabriel is here!
Hawk Moth::: Yes, but don't forget our deal. I feel Ladybug and Cat Noir nearby. Once you've got them in front of you, you'll be able to honor our agreement. Just take their jewels, the Miraculouses.
Simon Says::: It's as good as done. Simon says we'll defeat them!
Nino::: Ladybug! What's going down?
Ladybug::: We need to move to safer ground. Where is Adrien?
Nino::: Taking a shower.
Ladybug::: Now?
Nino::: It's the model in him.
Ladybug::: Take Nino to the atrium. I'll take care of Adrien. Leave the remote control with me.Adrien? Adrien!Eeee!
Adrien:::Yeah?
Ladybug::: Oh! Must... it-eh, to go! He he. Too dangerous... to leave!
Adrien::: Can I put on my clothes first?
Ladybug::: Sure! If you must... I-I mean, of course you can. 
Gabriel::: Where's my son?
Nino::: He'll be here. He's with Ladybug.
Gabriel::: Mmm.
Ladybug::: 
Adrien::: My mother on her 17th birthday. She was pretty, huh?
Adrien and Ladybug::: She's... got your eyes. 
Ladybug:::Stay here! 
Plagg::: Oh my! What was that all about? Sweet love?
Adrien::: ...Gotta help her!
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Plagg::: Oh, not again! 
Gabriel::: Are they coming?
Simon Says::: Gotcha.
Cat Noir::: Well, that's just great.
Simon Says::: Welcome to another exciting hour of The Challenge! Good evening again from Simon Says. Viewers, I've kept my promise. Here's Gabriel!
Simon Says::: Simon says... you are a butterfly! 
Gabriel:::Flap flap, flutter flutter, flutter flutter, flap flap!
Ladybug::: We've gotta save Mr. Agreste!
Simon Says::: Tomorrow, Butterfly, you will be no more.
Ladybug::: The akuma's gotta be in one of those cards.
Cat Noir::: But which one? There are so many of'em.
Simon Says::: Ladybug, Cat Noir, you can save him by giving me your Miraculouses. Do the right thing...
Ladybug::: In your dreams. Lucky Charm! 
Cat Noir::: A regular yo-yo? But you've got a magical one!
Ladybug::: I'll figure it out later.
Simon Says::: Simon says... your yo-yo is useless!Simon says... your stick is...
Cat Noir::: Useless? I don't think so. I'm not gonna let you get a word in edgewise!
Simon Says::: Simon says...
Cat Noir:::Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
Simon Says::: It doesn't matter whether you can hear me or not, all that is important is what Simon says! Simon says remove your Miraculous and give it to me!
Gabriel::: ...Flap, flutter, flutter, flap...
Simon Says::: Simon says... take off like an airplane! 
Cat Noir::: He's headed for the roof. We got to stop him.
Ladybug::: This is our last chance to capture the akuma and I can't do it alone! If we free Simon Says, we free Mr. Agreste too!
Cat Noir::: Then let's not waste another minute.
Simon Says::: And how will you defeat me without your yo-yo?
Simon Says::: Simon says... it's over! 
Ladybug::: Follow my lead.
Simon Says::: Simon says...
Simon Says::: That's not possible! I made your yo-yo useless!
Ladybug::: This one yes , but not that one . Miraculous Ladybug!
Ladybug::: My yo-yo! No more evildoing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly.
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: Pound it!
Cat Noir::: I'm afraid your flight's been canceled, sir.
Gabriel::: You?
Cat Noir::: Prefer Ladybug? Can't say I blame you. 
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, your ring! You better get out of here. 
Cat Noir::: Like a cat on a hot tin roof. See you again soon, Mr. Agreste.And you, m'lady. 
Gabriel::: Hmm...
Gabriel::: I've never noticed your ring before.
Adrien::: Is that the only thing you've never noticed about me?
Gabriel::: I'm glad everything worked out for the best.
Plagg::: Hmm?
Alec::: Welcome back to everyone's #1 game show, The Challenge! Last week, our cool DJ friend Nino won the challenge. So, let's welcome him back again. Come on out, DJ Nino! 
Tom::: Looks like you weren't absent or late all week! Excellent news, Marinette. You can go join your friends on the set.
Marinette::: I think I'd rather watch with you guys. That's... if you and Mom'd like that?
Alec:::So we upped the challenge for you tonight, Nino. You're gonna have to get two celebrities dancing instead of one! However, this time, you can choose your opponents.
Nino::: Oh, I've got this one in the bag. I'm gonna pick two buds I know won't let me down. Ladybug and Cat Noir!
Marinette:::Uh... On second thought, I'm wiped. I'm gonna take a nap. Don't wanna be late for school tomorrow! And, you know, mess up that perfect school record! Tell me what happens, 'kay?
Tom::: Sure.
Sabine::: Of course, honey.
Tom::: Sometimes I just can't figure that girl out.
Sabine::: Oh, give her a break. You know there's nothing more demanding than going to school!
