Marinette::: They're so in sync with each other.
Adrien:::You're right. Someday I hope I'll find someone I can share everything with…like they do.But until my father starts letting me go out more often, that probably won't be happening.
Marinette:::Are you sure your dad won't let you come? It's such a bummer.
Adrien:::You know how overprotective he is. One day he'll realize I'm not a child anymore, but we're not quite there yet. 
Nino::: Big finish, here we go!
Marinette::: You don't wanna miss this. 
Nino:::Yeah! 
Nora::: Aw, shoot. Did I miss the ballet?
Alya::: Nora, is your match over already?
Nora:::First round: total knockout. Huh-huh-huh.As usual.I told you a hundred times not to call me Nora in front of people, little sis.The name is Anansi, like a spider.
Alya::: Sure, I'll call you Anansi when you stop calling me 'little sis'.
Nora::: Anyway, what are you all still doing here this late? Don't you have school tomorrow?
Alya::: We're waiting for it to get dark. It's the World Cup fireworks show tonight, remember? We're gonna watch from the Ferris wheel.
Nora:::Oh no! Baguette and cappie can go with cellphone Boy if they want, but you're staying here.It's way too dangerous.
Marinette::: But Nora—I mean, Anansi, you can't do that!
Nino::: Yeah, no way dude, we're not going without Alya!
Alya::: Listen, I appreciate you worrying about me and all, but I'm not a little girl anymore. Besides, Mom and Dad are totally cool with it.
Nora::: Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk, there have been way too many akumatized peeps in Paris these last few weeks. Look how many times you've been in direct danger.So you're staying home, safe and sound, period!
Alya::: That's so ridiculous! The twins were akumatized right here at home. 
Nora::: Well, that would've never happened on my watch. I won't let anybody mess with my family.
Alya:::You mean like the other day at the square?
Adrien:::What happened?
Marinette::: Well… we came across a man handing out flyersNora thought the man was akumatized and wanted to turn Alya into a banana-zombie.
Nora::: Uh...uh...how was I supposed to know it was some stupid costume? And besides, what would happen if the Ferris wheel stopped working 'cause some akumatized dude refused to pay his fare? Once you fly-weights can actually defend yourselves like mewe'll talk about it.
Marinette::: It doesn't matter, because Ladybug and Cat Noir would save us if there were any problems.
Nora::: Uh-huh. And what if Mister Whiskers is catching a mouse and that Beetle's been sprayed with bug spray? What do you do then? 
Nino::: I can protect Alya if I have to.
Nora::: Oh yeah? And how exactly are you planning to defeat the villain? A dance-off? 
Nino:::I'd… do anything to protect Alya. 
Nora::: Hmm, ha! Okay, Alya can go out with you guys…if… you beat me at an arm wrestle.
Alya::: Please, don't arm-wrestle on my account. I don't need to be protected.
Adrien:::Nino, you don't stand a chance against Anansi; she's way too strong.
Nino:::Hey, dude!
Adrien::: Sorry, Nino; I'm sure we'll work something out.
Marinette::: We gotta go, or else we'll miss the fireworks.
Alya:::Forget it; you guys go without me.
Marinette and Nino::: Huh?!
Marinette::: No way!Okay, Nino will arm-wrestle you.
Nino and Alya::: What? 
Marinette::: Nino will prove his worth to us that he can defend Alya and every one of us, because—
Alya:::Marinette, what are you doing?
Marinette:::Don't worry, I got this.Because… uhh, because love and, uh, friendship, mmm, make your muscles bulge.
Nino:::Yeah, thanks Marinette.
Adrien:::All right! In position. Ready. Set.Go!
Nino::: Yaaaaa! 
Nora::: Really? Is that all you got?
Alya::: She's gonna rip his arm off. 
Nora::: 
Marinette:::Over there, an akuma! 
Nora:::What?!
Adrien::: And the winner is… Nino!
Marinette:::Oops, my bad; it was just a fly.
Nino::: Hmm? 
Marinette::: You rock, Nino. Come on, let's go. If we leave now we'll get there just in time.
Nora:::You're a bunch of cheaters. There's no way I could've been beaten by that fly-weight. If I hadn't been distracted, I—
Alya::: That's it, Nora! You lost the challenge, so deal with it. I've had it with your overprotective big-sis-smothering. I'm going out with my BFFs and I don't care what you think. Alya out. 
Marinette::: Uh, see you, Nora—I mean, Anansi. 
Hawk Moth::: A big sister with the best of intentions, unappreciated and unwanted — ideal prey for my akumas.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her broken spirit!
Nora:::They don't understand. They have no idea of the dangers. They're so clueless.
Hawk Moth:::Anansi, I am Hawk Moth. They didn't want your support and protection. Well, I'm giving you the power to show them just how dangerous the world really is. In return, you must defeat Ladybug and Cat Noir and bring me their Miraculous.
Nora::: Let the match begin, Hawk Moth. 
Marinette::: Just in time! Look at that!
Alya::: Wow!What's up?
Nino::: Oh, ah… nothing.
Adrien:::Whoa! It's beautiful, thank you, guys.Marinette, behind you! I saw something go by; what was it?
Marinette:::I don't see anything. Maybe it was a bird.
Nino:::Dude, please don't tell me we're gonna be stuck up here!
Alya:::I thought you said you were going to protect us.
Marinette:::Over there!A supervillain! 
Nino:::Uh, may-maybe you shouldn't film her, Alya. You don't wanna attract her over here.
Alya::: A new scoop for the Ladyblog. Ladybug and Cat Noir should be showing up any minute.
Adrien:::Uh… uh… I think my wifi is losing signal.My friends are in danger.
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Anansi:::Well, well. There you are, fly-weights.
Marinette, Alya and Nino:::Nora?!
Anansi::: Nora's not here to protect you anymore. I am Anansi, super-spider. 
Cat Noir:::All those arms, that's convenient, but you destroyed my scratching post.
Anansi::: Need a hand, kitty cat? 
Alya:::Nora… no!
Anansi::: You're no match for me, kitten.Go fetch the Ferris wheel.
Anansi::: Now that you can't cheat anymore, cappie, show us just how you plan to protect your friends.Come and get her if you're not a fly-weight!
Nino:::Alya! 
Marinette::: Nino!Nino, wait!
Nino:::I'm not a fly-weight and I don't need your help to prove it! 
Marinette:::Tikki, I think I messed up; we've gotta stop Nino...and save Alya!
Marinette:::Tikki, spots on! Ah!
Female civilian::: Thank you, Cat Noir.
Ladybug::: You do pretty well without me, I see.
Cat Noir::: Yup, but it's so much nicer when you're here, M'Lady.
Ladybug::: Let's go show that spider what two superheroes are capable of! Ha!
Nino::: Alya! 
Alya::: Nino, don't stick around.
Anansi::: Well, well, well. Look who it is.
Nino:::Anansi! You let Alya go right now! 
Anansi::: Oh yeah?And how exactly is a weak little fly-weight gonna force me to release my prisoner?
Ladybug::: Watch out! You need to leave this to the professionals. 
Nino:::This isn't over, spider!
Anansi:::So it's two versus one now? Fine with me! Round two… fight! 
Ladybug::: Cat Noir! 
Anansi::: On the floor already? We just started! 
Ladybug::: Are you okay? 
Cat Noir::: Everything except my pride.
Ladybug::: The Akuma must be in her headgear.
Cat Noir::: Yeah, but she's so strong we can't even get near her.
Ladybug::: Okay, change of plan. I take care of Anansi, you release the prisoner; it'll distract her enough to drop her guard.
Cat Noir::: Look out! 
Anansi:::Ding, ding, ding, bell's ringin'! Round three. FIGHT! 
Cat Noir::: Huh? Seriously?Oh… uh… M'Lady? I think I got myself into a sticky situation.
Anansi::: Looks like I've already got a catch. You'll be next, beetle.
Ladybug::: I don't think so! 
Anansi:::You're like a cat caught in a spider's web.
Cat Noir::: Technically speaking, spiders don't actually eat cats.
Anansi::: I suggest we make an exception for you, kitty cat.
Hawk Moth:::Anansi, grab his Miraculous from him.
Nino::: Are you okay, dude—uh, I mean, Ladybug?
Ladybug::: Yeah, but we're gonna need some help! square candle appears) A candle?Of course! But I don't have enough time to do a round trip.
Nino::: Maybe I could help you?Uh, I get it. It's cool. I'm no superhero. I'd tried to save Alya, but… guess I'm not strong enough.
Ladybug::: Let me tell you a secret, uh… 
Nino::: Nino. The name's Nino.
Ladybug::: Nino. When you're facing a supervillain, strength doesn't make a difference. Courage and determination do.We can't let Anansi get Cat Noir's Miraculous. Use this to defend yourself and distract her. I won't be long. 
Anansi::: Where did you hide your earrings, kitty cat?
Hawk Moth:::Anansi, the earrings are Ladybug's Miraculous!Ugh, Cat Noir's magic jewel is a ring!
Anansi::: Why didn't you just say so?
Nino::: Hey arachnid!
Anansi::: Ah, so you're back, cappie?
Ladybug:::I trust you, Nino. 
Marinette:::Master, Nino won't hold off Anansi for long. She's about to get a hold of Cat Noir's Miraculous!
Master Fu::: We can't let that happen.Marinette Dupain-Cheng, pick an ally you can trust to fight alongside you on this mission. Choose wisely; such power's on hand to serve a greater good. Once the mission is over, you must retrieve the Miraculous from them.
Marinette:::I need a protective Miraculous.That's the one I need, Master!Uh, if it's okay with you.
Master Fu:::Do you have someone in mind, Marinette? 
Marinette:::Actually, I think I found just the right person.
Anansi:::Wow, be careful. What are you trying to do with that little stick?
Cat Noir:::On your left; no, on your right. No, the other right!
Anansi:::You're gonna hurt yourself.
Hawk Moth:::Anansi, enough toying with your prey. Concentrate on seizing Cat Noir's Miraculous!
Alya::: Nino!
Nino::: So, who's the fly-weight now, huh?
Anansi::: All right, big Boy.I suggest you stay down, cappie.You're gonna regret this, big time!
Nino::: You shouldn't have underestimated me, legs. 
Cat Noir:::Your friend's good at this.
Alya::: Yeah, but I sure hope Ladybug comes back before he gets bad at it.
Anansi:::Game over. Time to fly, lightweight! 
Nino::: Thanks, Ladydude—uh, I mean, Ladybug.
Ladybug::: Thanks for dropping by...dude. 
Anansi:::It's just you and me, kitty cat.
Cat Noir::: Hey, spider, guess what. Cataclysm!
Hawk Moth:::No! Don't touch his ring; it's charged with destructive energy!
Anansi::: Hey, make up your mind, Mothy; I couldn't care less about his Miraculous. You're the one who's been nagging me about it all evening.
Hawk Moth:::Cat Noir has called on his power but he can't use it. Just be patient and wait for him to transform back. Then the ring will be uncharged once again and you'll be able to take it from him.
Anansi:::Whatever, if you say so. 
Cat Noir:::Hurry up, Ladybug.
Ladybug:::I'm gonna need your help again. Do you still wanna save your friend?
Nino:::I'll do anything for her.
Ladybug::: Nino Lahiffe,this is the Miraculous of the turtle, which grants the power of protection. You will use it for the greater good.
Nino:::Whoa, dude!
Wayzz::: Hello, my name is Wayzz.
Nino::: Hey little guy, what are you, a genie like in those fairy tales?
Wayzz::: I am a kwami. I can't grant wishes, but I can give you super powers.
Ladybug::: Once the job is done, you must return the Miraculous to me. Can I trust you?
Nino::: You bet, dudette.
Wayzz::: Then all you have to say is: Wayzz, shell on!
Nino::: Wayzz, shell on!
Carapace:::That's crazy!
Ladybug::: Stay focused! We have to hurry before Cat Noir transforms back. And we need him to save Alya. Lucky Charm! 
Carapace::: Boxing gloves? You're not gonna fight Anansi directly, are you?
Ladybug::: Why not? It's a simple plan, but you have to protect us — me, Cat Noir and Alya.You've already proved you're capable of doing it.
Carapace::: Hey, six-hands! Catch this! 
Anansi:::Change of pet? You replaced your kitty with a turtle?
Ladybug::: I love animals, but I'm not into spiders. Ha! 
Anansi::: Ha! Missed me.
Ladybug::: Did I?Anansi! I challenge you. One round. You win, you get my Miraculous. I win, you release your prisoners. What do you have to lose?In a few minutes, Cat Noir will transform back anyway.
Hawk Moth:::Don't listen to her; it's a trap!
Anansi::: Don't worry, butterfly man, this nasty bug ain't no match for Anansi.I'll devour you, li'l nasty bug.
Anansi::: One punch will be enough.
Ladybug:::You can't punch the wind. 
Anansi::: It's over. 
Ladybug::: One punch, huh? Well, maybe if you could actually land one.
Anansi::: Shut up!
Ladybug:::Why, do you have trouble doing two things at the same time? 
Anansi:::Stay still!
Ladybug:::You're so weak that when you're shadow-boxing, your shadow wins!
Anansi::: Shadow THIS!You can't win this fight, so give up and give me your Miraculous!
Ladybug::: You wish.
Ladybug:::It's all up to you, Captain Turtle.Use your power now!
Carapace::: At your service, dude—Uh, Ladybug.Shell-ter! Shiaaah!
Cat Noir:::You're not really replacing me with a turtle, are you? 
Ladybug::: Not now, kitty.Throw like a ladybug, scratch like a cat!
Ladybug::: No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye-bye little butterfly.Miraculous Ladybug!
Nora::: The Beetle and Mister Whiskers? What's going on here?
Cat Noir::: Uh, sorry, guys, but I've gotta split. 
Ladybug::: Cat Noir!You know you're irreplaceable.
Cat Noir:::Mm-hmm. 
Ladybug and Carapace:::Pound it!
Alya::: Whoa, this is a first for the Ladyblog. A brand new superhero! What's your name?
Carapace::: Uh…Huh… Carapace. Call me Carapace.
Ladybug:::See you later, bugheads. 
Alya:::And stay connected.
Carapace:::Shell off. 
Nino:::Thank you for trusting me.
Ladybug::: You were a true superhero, Nino.
Nino:::Uhh…
Hawk Moth::: You're gaining more allies, Ladybug, but don't rush to rejoice. Soon you might just be outnumbered. 
Nino:::Hey, you okay? You weren't too scared, were you?
Alya::: I'm fine. I saw that you tried to save me.
Nino::: Uhm. Actually… no, I didn't do much. It's not like I'm a superhero or anything. 
Alya:::I know perfectly well what you're like.
Nora::: Fly-weights!Truth is…I did lose the match…and my cool. Sorry about everything that went down.
Marinette::: Nor—uuh, uuh, Anansi. I...actually...you didn't lose the game.
Nora::: Huh?
Marinette::: I helped Nino to win by distracting you. I'm sorry.
Nora::: Hey! We're cool, Marinette.It's no big deal.Cappie proved that he doesn't need muscles to be strong.
Alya:::Want a scoop? You're the best.
Nino::: What if Nora came with us to the ice rink next weekend? It'd be more fun with her, don't you think?
Alya::: You're right, Nino. Besides, I don't even remember the last time I hung out with my big sis.
