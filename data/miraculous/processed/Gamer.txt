Marinette::: Dear diary, guess what? I was two spots away from transforming back and revealing my true identity to Cat Noir.
Tikki::: Hey Marinette, weren't you meeting Alya back at school this afternoon to research your term paper?
Marinette::: Oh no, I'm late! Again!
Tikki::: What's that noise?
Marinette::: Hide, Tikki!
Kim::: Come on, Max.
Marinette:::What's going on, Alya? 
Rose::: Try-outs for the Paris Ultimate Mecha Strike III Tournament! This school sends the two students with the highest scores!
Kim::: Actually, the tryouts offer a partner to team up with Max in the Tournament.
Marinette::: Why Max?
Kim::: 'Cause he's unbeatable! He's a total rocksord! He's got the highest APM over anyone!
Marinette::: APM?
Kim::: Actions per minute? This tournament is his whole life! He's been grinding all year to level up.
Caline::: Adrien is now in the lead.
Kim::: What happened, Max?
Max::: Hmm. Awesome job. We're gonna make a killer combo.
Marinette::: So let me get this straight. If someone manages to beat Max's score, they'll team up with Adrien at the tournament?
Kim::: No one can beat Max. Or rather Max and Adrien. It's a slam dunk. They're our school's dream team!
Alya::: I see where you're going with this, Little lady.
Marinette::: Just imagine, teaming with Adrien!
Alya::: Are you out of your mind, girl? This is about stepping up and representing! Not snuggling up and snogging! This is serious business!
Marinette::: Seriously Alya, you think I'd actually go through with that?
Mr. Damocles::: Well, I think we have our two champions lined up for the Paris tournament.
Marinette::: Wait! Uh, Is it too late... to try out?
Mr. Damocles::: Well, the library is closing up in five minutes, but...
Alya::: Oh, Boy...
Marinette::: Adrien's joypad! Ohhh...! 
Kim::: Is she serious? There's no way!
Alya::: Unless the particular player has a particular motivation.
Max::: The rules are elementary, You battle each other's robots with your own and...
Marinette::: Please... Every time you win, you loot its items and gain XP, which upgrades your mech. I'm not a noob, thank you very much.
Max::: Ah, sounds like you have a sufficient amount of knowledge. Let's see if it's enough to beat me.
Chloé::: Seriously? How could anyone spend so much time in front of a screen?
Sabrina::: I know, as if. 
Kim::: Come on, Max, you can do it!
Marinette::: And now, a quarter super plus heavy kick, and Flying Hyper Storm! Triple hit combo, Marinette style! Booyah!
Marinette::: Woo! Yeah! Woo hoo! I win! Uh-huh!
Kim::: Wha! I can't believe it! She... she beat him?
Alya::: Beat him? She pulverized him!
Rose::: The king's been knocked off his throne!
Max::: I accept this defeat. I relinquish my position at the tournament. Congratulations, Marinette. And Adrien.
Adrien::: Max, wait!
Kim::: Oh, Max...
Max::: Look. I'm fine, I lost fair and square. But if you don't mind, I'd like a little solitude.
Mr. Damocles::: So, Marinette Dupain-Cheng and Adrien Agreste will represent Françoise Dupont High School at the Paris Ultimate Mecha Strike III Tournament. Good luck to both of you.
Adrien::: Well, I guess I'll be coming over to practice. With my new partner. See you later.
Marinette::: See... ya...
Alya::: Now you gotta win and you're gonna be representing the school, not just hanging out with Adrien.
Marinette::: Oh, Adrien...
Alya::: Oh, brother... 
Max::: This is a travesty. An unequivocal travesty!
Hawk Moth:::Ah, a competition. I know you like that, my little evil akumas. Where there's a winner, there's always a loser.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!
Max::: I should've been going to that tournament. I was the chosen one! I worked so hard for it! Inconceivable!
Hawk Moth::: Gamer, I am Hawk Moth. I'll help you win the tournament of your life. But in return, you must help me achieve my high score.
Max::: Absolutely, Hawk Moth. Game on! Now to see who's the greatest gamer in Paris! 
Marinette::: Ah, training with Adrien! Adrien!
Tikki::: If all you wanted to do is spend time with Adrien, there are other ways to do that!
Marinette::: What are you getting at?
Tikki::: You know how much Max wanted to be in that tournament. Kim said he'd been training for it all year.
Marinette::: Right. All I could think about was Adrien. Hey! Adrien's coming to my house.Adrien's coming to my house! No, this is a total disaster! I have to... clean my room!
Tikki::: That's what I've been trying to tell you all along.
Marinette::: Oh, this... is not... happening!!
Tikki::: Calm down, Marinette. You still have time. It's not like he's gonna show up this very minute.
Sabine:::Marinette! Someone's here to see you!
Marinette::: Uh... Coming!
Adrien::: Marinette and I are finalists in the Paris Ultimate Mecha Strike III Tournament.
Tom::: No way. Well, she did learn from the best Tom style! Booyah!
Sabine::: Marinette never told us about this Tournament.
Adrien::: We were just pairing out today.
Sabine::: You two are a pair, huh? I'm not surprised. Marinette talks a lot about you, you know?
Marinette::: Mom! ...Come up, Adrien!
Adrien::: Uh, very nice to meet you.
Tom & Sabine::: Ohhh...
Hawk Moth::: Gamer. It's time to get to the next level and show everyone that you're the best!
Gamer::: No time like the present! Hahahahaha!
Marinette::: Oh! Hahaha. Sorry.
Adrien::: No, you go.
Both::: I'll use the other one.Ah! 
Adrien::: Your parents seem nice.
Marinette::: Oh yeah, they are. But... sometimes...Ahhhh! 
Adrien::: Sometimes what?
Tom:::Everything going good? I thought just in case you wanted something to eat...
Marinette::: Uh... no thanks, Papa. We're training.
Tom::: Well then, uh, maybe you could use a few tips, you know... dad style.
Marinette::: Thanks, but no thanks! Papa!
Marinette::: Sometimes my parents could be a little nosey.Where were we?
Gamer::: I'll be at level 2 in no time! My skills are indisputable!I am unstoppable! Hahahaha!Excellent! 
Adrien::: Wow! We won again, thanks to you!
Marinette::: Yeah, um, yes we did.
Adrien::: We? That was practically all you. You're amazing, Marinette. I guess you wouldn't even need me. I'm so lame compared to you...
Marinette::: Um, no no no, I... No, you're so good. I mean, I'm the one who's not good. I mean... I'm lucky, that's all.
Tom:::Anyone want cookies? They hot from the oven!
Marinette::: Papa, we're trying to work here!
Marinette::: Actually, you know what? I've got a secret.This is why I win.
Adrien::: Are you messing with me?
Marinette::: Try playing a match with it.
Sabine::: How about a delicious salmon and spinach pie? You can tell me what you think of it?
Adrien::: Uh, Marinette. A little snack wouldn't hurt, would it?
Marinette::: Uh, I'm really sorry. It's impossible to get anything down with my parents around.
Adrien::: That's okay.I didn't know your dad made such yummy pie!
Marinette::: Oh, uh, I... yeah! So, shall we go back?
Adrien::: Let's see if it works. 
Marinette::: Tell me this isn't some kind of publicity stunt for the tournament!
Gamer::: Well, well. Marinette, let's see who's victorious this time.
Adrien::: Doesn't look like a publicity stunt to me.
Adrien::: Look out!Uh, we better get outta here!
Gamer::: Game over, Marinette!
Marinette::: How does he know my name? Max!I guess he really did want that spot on the tournament!
Adrien::: Time to transform.
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Gamer::: Game over!
Cat Noir::: Not yet! Here comes a new challenger!
Marinette::: Cat Noir! Hey! Over here!
Cat Noir::: I heard Miss Video Game Champion really took down the final boss.
Marinette::: Well it doesn't give him extra points to go transforming everyone. Hey, wait, Cat Noir! I left my friend Adrien at the park! He might be in danger, we have to go back!
Cat Noir::: Uh... don't worry. Adrien's not in danger. He'll be fine. You'll be safe here. Just stay put. Don't worry, Cat Noir will take care of everything. Arch, leap, and do a barrel roll!
Marinette::: Uh, he's always so over-the-top.
Tikki::: If ever there was a game to win, this is it! Let's go!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Cat Noir::: Get away from here! As far as you can!Hurry!
Cat Noir::: Hey, tin can! Over here!
Gamer::: My calculations indicate that your system's about to crash!
Ladybug::: You're the one crashing, robot! 
Cat Noir::: He's a life-size robot, from Ultimate Mecha Strike!
Ladybug::: I know! And it's nearly at level 3. 4 is the highest level!
Cat Noir::: Wait, you know that game?
Ladybug::: Duh! Of course!
Cat Noir::: See? You and me! It was meant to be.
Cat Noir::: Uh, I think our problem just got a whole lot bigger.
Gamer::: Level 3. Hahahahahaha!
Hawk Moth::: If you want to be the most powerful robot in the world, you must capture Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses. Then it really will be Game Over.
Gamer::: Those Miraculouses are mine! 
Ladybug::: We have to get him out of here before he destroys all of Paris!
Ladybug & Cat Noir::: The stadium! 
Ladybug::: Where has Clunky got to?
Gamer::: Hahahaha! 
Ladybug::: Attack the robot with your Cataclysm Power! It might be enough to shock him!
Cat Noir::: My pleasure. Two can play this game. Cataclysm! 
Gamer::: Nooooo!

Cat Noir::: Cat Noir Style! Booyah!
Cat Noir::: Whoa ha ha! Check out that loot!

Gamer::: Hahahaha! You've forgotten the rules. I saved my last level!Respawn!
Cat Noir::: Aww, not the old spawn point glitch again.
Ladybug::: Yeah, but did you see he pushed that button on his glasses? I bet the akuma's in there.
Ladybug::: Ha! We've leveled up too!
Cat Noir:::Okay, but I only got a few minutes left.
Cat Noir::: I'll man it, you shoot!
Ladybug::: Why do you get to man it?
Cat Noir::: What do you say we flip for it?
Cat Noir::: Okay, you man it and I'll fire.

Cat Noir::: Catouken! 
Gamer::: Gamer Crusher! 
Ladybug::: Shoryubug! 
Cat Noir::: Catouken!

Announcer::: So remember, the High Score to beat is 24500, so gamers, hit those consoles. Game on!
Alya::: You bent over backwards to be in the team and now you wanna pull out?
Marinette::: It's just that I feel so bad for Max. And well, it just wouldn't be right.
Alya:::You're doing the right thing. But honestly, it's not like you get the chance to play with Adrien everyday...
Marinette::: ...Max? I've thought about this a lot, and...
Announcer::: And now, representing Françoise Dupont High School...
Marinette::: Well, I think you should be playing tonight, Max.
Max::: What?
Marinette::: Don't get me wrong! I love gaming, but it's not my heart and soul. This is your baby. It's your tournament, Max. I don't wanna take that away from you.
Nino::: Dudes, make up your minds. They're waiting for you.
Marinette::: I insist! 
Max::: I don't know how to thank you.
Adrien::: By winning the tournament... with her.
Marinette::: Huh?
Adrien::: Go on, Marinette. You're a hundred times better than me. You belong on the team. Win the tournament for the school. I know you can do it.
Nino::: Go on, dudes! They're waiting for you!
Marinette::: No, uh, I... only with you?
Max::: Let's show them who's gold.
