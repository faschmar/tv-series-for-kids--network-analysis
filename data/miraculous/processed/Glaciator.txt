Bus driver:::It's no good! The brakes are busted!
Ladybug::: Ready, Cat Noir?
Cat Noir::: I'm always ready, my lady. Who needs brakes when they've got us?
Cat Noir::: So, uh, Ladybug? What would you say if you and I met up tonight for a little dinner? Rooftop style?
Ladybug::: For dinner? As superheroes?
Cat Noir::: Well, uh, yeah. That's right. We're only together when we're saving Paris. I mean, wouldn't you actually like to get to know one another?
Ladybug::: I... That's so thoughtful of you, but I can't. I have to, uh, I already have plans with some friends.
Bus driver:::Thank you.Thank you, Ladybug.
Cat Noir::: Well, if your plans end early, come and join me.
Ladybug::: We'll see.
Cat Noir::: I'll be waiting, my lady.
Sabine::: It was delicious, sweetheart!
Tom::: And as a dessert...
Marinette::: Huh?
Tom::: Ta-da! 
Marinette::: Wow! Uh, no thanks, Dad.
Tom::: But isn't this your favorite?
Marinette::: And it still is, Dad!But...I told you I was going out with friends. We're gonna get ice-cream at André's—
Sabine and Tom::: Oh, Sweetheart's Ice Cream!
Sabine::: That was where your father asked me—
Marinette::: To marry him.
Sabine::: He hid the ring in a scoop of vanilla ice-cream.
Marinette::: And you almost swallowed it too! 
Sabine::: They say that couples who eat ice-cream at André's will stay in love forever.
Tom::: By the way, Marinette, who are you getting ice-cream with? 
Marinette::: Oops, gotta go!Don't wanna be late, see you later, guys!
Tom and Sabine::: Ohhh...
Nathalie::: There's no point in waiting for your father, Adrien. He'll be eating in his office.
Adrien:::Then what's the point of keeping me here if he's never gonna show up, Nathalie? 
Nathalie::: Don't forget to practice your piano before you go to bed.
Plagg::: You could've at least grabbed the piece of Camembert on that platter!
Adrien:::Fuel up, Plagg.Adrien may not be allowed out of the house, but Cat Noir is!
Plagg::: You seem in a hurry to get stood up.
Adrien::: She didn't say she wasn't coming.
Plagg::: But she didn't say she was either!
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out! 
Plagg::: Don't even give me a minute to digest my fooooood!
Marinette::: Hey, Alya!
Alya::: Hey, Marinette! 
Marinette::: Where's Adrien?
Alya::: Don't get upset, okay? But Nino just got a text. Adrien's dad isn't letting him go out.
Marinette::: Once again...
Nino::: Yo, Marinette!
Ivan::: What's up, M?
Mylène::: How are you, Marinette?
Marinette::: I'm fine. Thanks. Hehe. So, do you know where André is today?
Nino::: The deal with André and his ice-cream cart is that you never know where he's gonna be.You gotta follow his clues to find out where he's going to set up. 
Ivan::: The first time Mylène and I wanted André's ice-cream, it took us three hours to find his cart!Do you remember? 
Nino::: Hey! Someone posted a photo! He's on his way to the Pont des Arts.
Ivan::: Let's hurry!
Mylène::: Let's go! 
Alya::: Come on, Marinette! 
Marinette::: Yeah! Awesome! 
André:::My name is André! André! Glacé! The sweetheart matchmaker! With one scoop or two, I'll find up for you with magical ice-cream flavors! My name is André! André! Glacé! The sweetheart matchmaker! With one scoop or two, I'll find up for you with magical ice-cream flavors! 
Nino:::Hey, he's here!
Alya:::Let's go!
André:::Pistachio, vanilla, and strawberry! For lovebirds from Italy.
Italian couple::: Merci, André!
André::: You're welcome, my friends. Enjoy André's ice-cream. May love never end!
Mylène:::Bonjour, André.
André::: Striking young Ivan and dear sweet Mylène! If you aren't still the cutest lovebirds I've seen!Chocolate, praline, and white nougat for you! A special concoction to keep your love true!Ah, these two I've never seen. This your first time here with me?
Nino and Alya:::Yeah!
André::: Coconut, banana, and a touch of passion fruit!
Tikki::: Why don't you go and get one, too, Marinette?
Marinette:::What's the point? Adrien won't be coming.
Tikki::: He might not be here, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying a yummy ice-cream and a fun night with your friends. And you could give me a taste, too!
André::: And how about this young miss?The pretty one who sighs. I have a flavor just for her! It's sure to make her smile!
Marinette::: Uh... Me?
André::: What's your name, dear? 
Marinette::: Marinette.
André:::Peach pink like his lips and mint like his eyes. Eat this, my dear, and your love will materialize! 
Marinette:::Uh...um. No! I- There's been a mistake! I'm not in love with anyone. And I think I just lost my appetite. 
André::: Why of course you are, my little one. When there's love burning in one's heart, André knows it from the start. Enjoy your ice-cream, Marinette. I know he'll be here.
Ivan::: Green eyes like mint... Who could that possibly be?
Marinette:::Thank you, but you've got it all wrong. I don't have a-Adrien? 
Wayem's friend::: Hey!You finally made it! That's great!
André:::André's ice-cream has always melted hearts. But the magic will only work if you eat it! I'll make you another one.
Marinette:::Thanks, but it's really not necessary.
André:::Yes it is, my dear. See here? My ice-cream has brought everyone together. Every famous loving couple in Paris! Edith and Marcel, John and Serge, Olive and Tom! Your loved one is out there! Somewhere! All you need is to believe in the magic of André's ice-cream!
Marinette::: You're very nice, André. But I don't have a loved one.
Ivan::: Who has green eyes?You think we know him?
Marinette::: Lay off, Ivan. There's no one, okay?And I don't think there's something magical about your ice-cream. It's just... ice-cream.
Nino:::Hey, I was gonna get another one!
André::: But André's ice-cream always melts people's hearts.At least, it used to. 
Hawk Moth::: A thwarted artist, his shattered dreams and the collapse of his whole little world. Quite chilling.Fly away, my little akuma, and freeze the heart of this ice-cream maker!
André::: I don't understand. It's never failed. Ever. 
Hawk Moth:::Glaciator, I am Hawk Moth. Revenge is a dish best served cold since they refuse to let them melt their hearts. I'm giving you the power to melt their entire bodies instead! I only ask a little favor in return: Get me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.
André::: Ladybug and Cat Noir flavored ice-cream? It's a deal, Hawk Moth. I'll even give a double scoop!
Glaciator::: Hello! How about some ice-cream? Will that do? Enjoy it, it's just for you!Marinette?
Marinette:::What a disaster! I ruined the whole night for all of my friends! I was mean to André! I'm so lame.
Tikki::: You're not lame. You just overreacted a little. Just let it go. Tomorrow will be a new day!
Marinette::: I'll never get to eat ice-cream with Adrien.
Cat Noir::: She loves me.She loves me not.She loves me.She loves me...
Cat Noir::: Hello.
Marinette:::Cat Noir?
Cat Noir::: Sorry.I didn't mean to frighten you. 
Marinette::: What are you doing here? Don't you have like superhero-y things to do?
Cat Noir::: No, I don't feel like being a superhero tonight. And I also don't feel like being alone tonight. Would you mind if I hung out here for a little while?Marinette, right? We've bumped into each other before.
Marinette::: Yeah, a bunch of times. I mean- yes! We have. One time a super villain fell in love with me. Talk about bad luck.
Cat Noir::: Seriously. I seem to have bad luck in the love department myself.
Marinette::: Really? What kind?
Cat Noir::: Well, tonight, I had this special surprise all planned for Ladybug.
Marinette::: You're in love with Ladybug?!For real?So what was this special surprise?
Cat Noir:::It doesn't really matter. 'Cause she never showed.
Marinette::: Sounds like you and I both need a bit of cheering up tonight.
Cat Noir::: You? You've gotten your heart broken too?
Marinette::: Yup.Huh?
Cat Noir:::Hey, come with me.Close your eyes and hold on tight, okay? 
Cat Noir::: Just give me a minute.Alright, you can open your eyes now.
Marinette:::Wow! Cat Noir, this is... beautiful!I'm so sorry.
Cat Noir::: Why? It's not your fault.
Marinette::: No— Yeah— I mean— What I mean is I'm very sorry for you because, um, you prepared all of this and then... she didn't show.
Cat Noir::: She told me she might not make it but I had my fingers crossed. I really wanted her to come.
Marinette:::Maybe she had a really good reason for not coming. Like, a problem or something.
Cat Noir::: You're only saying that to make me feel better.
Marinette::: Yeah. I mean— No! I mean—Look out!
Glaciator::: Marinette, party pooper, you're looking so sad and surly, but Glaciator will make it all better. Don't you worry!
Cat Noir:::What on Earth is that? Another supervillain in love with you?
Marinette::: No! That's André the ice-cream maker.
Cat Noir::: The Sweetheart's Ice-Cream guy? He isn't looking too sweet right now.
Marinette::: It's—It's a long story.
Glaciator:::I'm Glaciator, the mean ice-cream man. Escape my fury if you can! I melt your hearts, but I was wrong, now I'll freeze your bodies so long! 
Cat Noir::: Go inside, Marinette. I'm gonna lead him away from you.
Marinette:::Cat Noir! Thanks for cheering me up.
Cat Noir::: It was the least I could do. 
Tikki:::Wow, I've never seen the sensitive side of Cat Noir before.
Marinette::: Yeah, maybe I was wrong about him. 
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Cat Noir::: Hey, Snow Dude, you lookin' for me?
Glaciator::: Bad kitty! Where have you hidden Marinette?
Ladybug::: Hello, Kitty. Did the bad guys leave you cold?
Cat Noir:::How was your amazing evening with your friends?
Glaciator::: I've never tasted superhero flavor before. I can't wait to serve myself a double scoop!
Hawk Moth:::Don't forget what you promised me. Give me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!
Glaciator::: I'm a man of my word, Hawk Moth.Come out now, or I'll bury Paris in an entire layer of ice-cream!
Ladybug::: The ice-cream seems to fire out of his hand, and before André was akumatized, he served his ice-cream using a-a whatcha-ma-call-it!
Cat Noir::: The whatcha-ma-call-it's called an ice-cream scooper. That must be where he's hiding the akuma.
Glaciator::: It's been a bomb, but now it's time to turn you into popsicles!Once and for all! 
Ladybug::: That's weird. It looks like he's leaving the couples alone.
Cat Noir::: Too bad for us.
Ladybug::: You don't understand. We know he doesn't attack couples so we could pretend—
Cat Noir::: Pretend?
Ladybug::: To be in love!
Cat Noir::: Sorry, Ladybug, it's not cool to play with people's feelings.
Ladybug::: Are you mad at me because I didn't show up?
Cat Noir:::What do you think?
Ladybug::: I didn't mean to hurt you.
Cat Noir::: And I also had a surprise for you, too!
Ladybug::: I really am sorry.
Cat Noir::: No... I'm the one who's sorry. Maybe another time.
Glaciator::: Show yourselves, cowards!
Cat Noir::: I think we better try your idea.
Ladybug::: Perfect.
Glaciator::: I know you're here!
Hawk Moth::: Glaciator, fire! Now's the time! Freeze them! Forever!
Cat Noir:::Hey!
Ladybug::: It's all part of the plan.
Glaciator::: I can't, Hawk Moth! They look so... in love.
Ladybug::: Now!I've hit something inside. André hasn't turned into the monster, he's inside the monster! 
Cat Noir:::Look out! 
Glaciator::: This isn't... over! 
Cat Noir::: What should we do now?
Ladybug::: We've got to take care of Glaciator before all these people totally melt away! Lucky Charm! 
Cat Noir::: Looks like someone's going for a ride.
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, I need you to grab three signposts and tie them to your stick. We're gonna make a propeller!
Cat Noir::: A propeller?
Glaciator:::A popsicle freeze is coming your way! If you don't pass my press! 
Ladybug:::Alright, now give me your belt!
Glaciator:::I'm Glaciator, you can't run from me! Handover your Miraculous! 
Ladybug::: Ready, kitty?
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm! 
Cat Noir::: Faster! 
Glaciator::: Wuah! Ah! Whaaaa!
Ladybug::: No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! 
Ladybug and Cat Noir:::Pound it!
André::: Sacré blue! How enchanting!Saved from the cold by a couple of super lovebirds!
Cat Noir:::He said it.
Hawk Moth::: Ladybug, you've melted all my plans! But someday, I will triumph, and it will taste of such sweet revenge!
Ladybug::: It's beautiful, Cat Noir.
Cat Noir::: Aren't you glad you finally came?
Ladybug::: Listen, I don't wanna play around with your feelings. It would be the same as lying to you. I don't wanna do that. You're more than a partner, Cat Noir. You're my friend. And I'd never wanna lie to a friend.
Cat Noir::: Why do you think it'd be lying?
Ladybug::: Because there's this Boy I...
Cat Noir::: There's a Boy? Who is...?
Ladybug::: It's— I can't tell you who it is. We can't know anything about each other. Our identities must remain a secret. We're both superheroes, Cat Noir. We don't have a choice.
Cat Noir::: I get it, Ladybug. Your friendship means everything to me.You can keep the rose. It goes with your costume.
Plagg::: The only way to get over a heartache is to eat a whole bunch of cheese! Shall we?
Adrien::: I don't have a heartache, Plagg.
Plagg::: Great! So then.... no cheese fest?
Adrien::: Perhaps Ladybug will love me someday. I mean, like, I love her. I have to believe. In the meantime, her friendship is the best gift of all.
Plagg::: Blagh! All this sweet talk is grossing me out! I need Camembert!
Marinette::: Hello, André.
André::: Hey, pretty Marinette! Can I offer you some ice-cream? To eat this time.
Marinette::: Of course! How else would I know if your ice-cream is really the best in Paris?
André:::Peach pink like his lips and mint like his eyes! 
Marinette:::It's delicious!
André::: Do you still think it doesn't lock two loves together?
Marinette::: Never say never. Have a good day, André! 
André::: See you again soon, my dear!
Tikki:::Mmm. 
André::: Another customer! Welcome! Would you like some of André's Sweetheart's Ice-cream?
Adrien::: Is your ice-cream really magical?
André::: What do you think?
Adrien::: I think you have to believe.
André::: You're spot on, son!Strawberry with black chocolate chip! Blackberries for her hair, and blueberry ice-cream just like her sky blue stare!On the house!There's love in your eyes! André can see it clear as day! This love is true!
Adrien::: Have a good day!
