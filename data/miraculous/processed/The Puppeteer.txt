Marinette:::Here I am, m'lady!
Marinette:::Glad to see you, Cat Noir!
Marinette:::Of course you are! I'm the cat's meow! 
Manon::: He shouldn't say that!
Marinette::: No? 
Marinette:::This is no time to be goofing around, Cat Noir! We gotta capture the baddies' akumas before they–Actually, what do the baddies want?
Manon::: Uh....we wanna win!
Marinette::: Yeah, but win what?
Manon::: I don't know. What do they usually want?
Marinette::: Depends. Lady Wifi wanted to reveal Ladybug's true identity and Evillustrator wanted to get revenge on a girl for making fun of him! Then there was Rogercop. But the evil Hawk Moth, who makes them bad, wants to take Ladybug's and Cat Noir's jewels from them! Their Miraculouses!
Manon::: And what would happen if he did get them?
Marinette::: The bad guys... would win!
Manon::: I know! I know what the bad guys want! We want the Miraculous! Then we'll win! Forever and ever! I'm gonna get your Miraculous, Ladybug and Cat Noir! You-you goody two-shoeses! You'll be super-duper sorry!
Marinette::: You won't get our Miraculouses!
Manon::: Oh yeah? 
Marinette::: Yay! Ladybug and Cat Noir have won again!
Manon::: No fair!! You always win!! 
Marinette::: Ladybug and Cat Noir always win, and the bad guys always lose.
Manon::: But you never let me play with Ladybug and Cat Noir!
Marinette::: Oh, don't cry! Of course you can play with Ladybug and Cat Noir! I'll even let you borrow one of them if you want. 
Nadja::: I'm back, Manon. Have you been a good girl?
Manon::: Mommy!! Marinette didn't let me win!!She didn't play fair and square!!
Nadja::: Oh, Manon, you can't always expect to win!
Manon::: Yes, I can! Ladybug and Cat Noir always win!
Nadja::: Well, you're right there! But they're superheroes!
Marinette::: You'll win next time, Manon!
Nadja::: Alright, now give the doll back to Marinette.
Manon::: NO! I wanna keep it!
Marinette::: She can if she wants. I told her she could borrow it.
Nadja::: And that's sweet of you, Marinette, but Manon already has so many toys at home, I wouldn't even know where to put it.
Manon::: NO!Huh?
Nadja::: Look what you've done, Manon! Give it to me. I'm sorry, Marinette.
Marinette::: Oh, it's nothing, I can sew it up again! It's no problem, really.
Nadja::: Oh, thank goodness! Come on, Manon, we're leaving. Say goodbye.
Manon::: I... want... that... DOLL!
Nadja::: No, you can play with it here next time you come. Come on, Manon, be a good girl and say goodbye. 
Manon:::Goodbye.
Nadja:::Hi, Alec. Huh? Didn't I leave it for you on my desk at the station? 
Manon::: Uh, I left my bag up there, mommy!
Nadja::: Go quickly and get it!It's not there, huh?
Tikki::: I think our heroes are in need of a little TLC!
Marinette::: Manon! What are you-
Manon::: I left my bag here!Can I have Ladybug?
Marinette::: You heard what your mom said.
Manon::: She wouldn't know if I hide it!
Marinette::: Sorry, but I have to sew her up!
Manon::: Pretty pleeeeease??
Marinette::: Oh please, please not the baby doll eyes! 
Marinette::: Ugh. Okay, you can borrow Lady Wifi.
Manon::: Can I have the Ladybug doll?
Nadja::: Hold on Alec. Hurry up Manon! We have to stop by the station!
Manon::: Coming, mommy! 
Tikki::: Wow, she sure had you wrapped around her little finger!
Marinette::: What!? No she didn- ugh. You know Tikki, I can't say no to those-
Tikki::: Baby doll eyes? Just be glad none of Ladybug's baddies have them! You'd be rendered powerless!
Manon:::Here I am, baddie! Haha! I've saved Paris again!
Manon:::No! No fair! You always win!
Nadja::: I'm sorry, Alec. I thought I gave it to you. It must be in the studio.
Alec::: No sweat!
Nadja:::Can you just keep an eye on Manon for me, please? I won't be long. 
Manon:::Where are you hiding... Ladybug?!
Nadja:::Wha...? This is one of Marinette's dolls. You took it after I specifically told you not to!
Manon::: But, Marinette wanted me to have it!
Nadja::: You disobeyed me. I told you the dolls were to stay at her house. You won't be needing these anymore.
Manon::: NO! Mommy, please don't!
Nadja::: I'm not happy about this. Wait for me here.
Manon::: I didn't steal that doll! I want that DOLL!
Hawk Moth:::Ah, what could be more pure than an innocent child's emotions? Especially anger. I love it!Fly away, evil akuma, and commiserate with this frustrated child! 
Marinette::: The movie starts in thirty minutes. Or, we could buy your book first and go to the next showing.
Alya::: Either way girl.Marinette, nine 'o' clock!
Marinette::: No, there's no nine 'o' clock showing.
Alya::: Not that nine 'o' clock! This nine 'o' clock! 
Marinette::: Adrien!
Alya::: Come on! 
Marinette:::Sorry.
Hawk Moth::: Puppeteer, I'm Hawk Moth. From now on, you can control anyone!
Manon::: Even Ladybug and Cat Noir?
Hawk Moth::: Yes... as long as you possess their dolls.
Manon::: And I can win?
Hawk Moth::: Yes, you will be able to win! But, in return, you have to get something for me!
Manon::: Give you their Miraculouses! I know! 
Hawk Moth::: What a smart little girl you are.
Puppeteer::: Wanna play a game?
Receptionist::: Heeelp!
Puppeteer::: I've got to get Ladybug and Cat Noir's dolls! I... want... those... DOLLS! 
Nadja::: I'm sure I left it in here. Ugh. Where is it?! Ah. Here it is.Sorry, Alec. Here's the file you need.
Marinette::: I wonder what station he's getting off at. Oh—maybe he's going to the same movie! Oh! How cool would that be!? But wait! But then, he might think we're following him! Like stalkers! What? Me, a stalker? HAH! Although, I would follow him. You know, of course I wouldn't really stalk him! Oh...who am I kidding?!
Alya::: Haha! Who are you talking to?
Alya::: He's waving!
Marinette::: Oh no! Now what are we gonna do?
Alya::: Wave back!
Puppeteer::: Okay, Lady Wifi, come to life!
Alya::: What— what's going on!? 
Marinette::: Alya!
Lady Wifi::: Marinette! Give me those Ladybug and Cat Noir dolls!
Marinette::: Lady Wifi?
Lady Wifi::: No! I'm Puppeteer! And I... want... those... dolls... NOW!!
Marinette::: Puppeteer? The dolls? I don't-I don't have them. They're at home! Why…Why do you want them, Puppeteer?
Lady Wifi::: Because, you said I could have them! Then Mommy said no! So give 'em to me now! Or you'll be super duper sorry!
Marinette:::Manon!
Lady Wifi::: I want Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses, to win! Forever and EVER!!
Marinette:::Manon! This isn't a game!
Adrien::: Excuse me sir, there's a...uh...cat loose on the train!
Train Manager::: What? Thanks kiddo! 
Plagg:::Cat?!
Adrien::: Plagg! We have to transform!
Plagg:::Just when we'd shaken off your bodyguard. 
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Plagg::: What about the movie? And the buttery popcorn?
Marinette::: Tikki, I have to find a place to transform. 
Cat Noir::: Hey, that was Lady Wifi. Did that villain say anything to you?
Marinette::: Uh, I'm not sure, but her voice belonged to a little girl I babysit. It's as if she was controlling my friend, Alya—I mean, Lady Wifi—from a distance. This is so weird.
Cat Noir::: And what was this talk about dolls?
Marinette::: I've got some dolls she likes to play with.
Cat Noir::: Your dolls? Okay, where do you live?
Marinette::: 12 Rue Gotlib.
Cat Noir::: I'll take care of it! 
Marinette::: I don't like the idea of Cat Noir rummaging around my room. 
Tikki::: Just say the words.
Marinette::: Tikki, Spots on! Ha!
Ladybug::: Hey kitty, up here!Puppeteer! Such a shame, it's really not nice to steal from your babysitter.
Cat Noir::: Breaking and entering are grounds for a serious time-out.
Puppeteer::: Soon I'll get your Miraculouses, you goody two-shoeses!
Cat Noir::: There's only one good two-shoes around here and I'm not her!
Lady Wifi::: Freeze!
Ladybug::: Remember how we defeated Lady Wifi the first time?
Cat Noir::: Take out the wi-fi signal! Gotcha! 
Hawk Moth::: Nice move, Puppeteer, good girl! Now - take her Miraculous!
Ladybug::: Looks like you've just lost your signal, Wifi! 
Ladybug::: Where's the akuma?
Puppeteer::: I want those dolls, Lady Wifi!
Cat Noir::: Did you capture her akuma?
Ladybug::: She didn't have one!
Cat Noir::: How's that possible?
Ladybug::: She's controlled by Puppeteer! She must have the akuma!
Cat Noir::: Why, Lady Wifi's nothing but a puppet! Please tell me you got the Cat Noir doll!
Ladybug::: Sorry, only this one. 
Cat Noir::: We'd better find her fast before she takes care of the other dolls! And me! 
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, your ring! You're about to transform back!
Cat Noir::: Don't let her make me a puppet! You know I like to be in command! 
Ladybug::: You mean second-in-command. Call me when you're back in business. 
Nadja::: Yes? What? Ladybug!?
Ladybug::: Where are you?
Nadja::: At the TV station.
Ladybug::: Is your daughter with you?
Nadja::: Yes! She's playing downstairs! Why? Is everything okay, Ladybug?
Ladybug::: Yes! Just don't move. I'll be right there!
Puppeteer::: I'm gonna use these dolls to beat Ladybug fair and square!
Plagg::: What? I'm savoring my cheese!
Adrien::: Would you mind savoring it a little faster? Plagg, claws out! 
Ladybug::: She's still here in the building! We need you all outside!
Nadja::: No! I want to find my daughter!
Ladybug::: I'll bring your daughter back, Mrs Chamack. It'll help me more to know you're safe.
Puppeteer::: Evillustrator! Come to life! 
Puppeteer::: Rogercop! Come to life! 
Cat Noir::: Have you located her?
Ladybug::: Inside the KIDZ+ TV building!
Cat Noir::: Got it! 
Cat Noir::: I'm OK, not a puppet yet! But I'd love to find the akuma before that changes.
Ladybug::: : Sorry! On three, One... two... three! 
Puppeteer::: Cat Noir! Come to Life!
Cat Noir::: No! 
Ladybug::: Cat Noir! No!
Hawk Moth::: Use Cat Noir to seize Ladybug's doll! When you control that one, you'll have won everything, and Ladybug will be defeated!
Puppeteer and Cat Noir::: Gimme that Ladybug doll! I'm gonna get your Miraculous!
Ladybug::: Not so fast, rugrat!The Akuma must be in there. 
Puppeteer:::Stop her! 
Ladybug::: Sorry Cat Noir! One against five!? That's not very fair and square!
Hawk Moth::: This is the moment I've been waiting for. Your time is up Ladybug! You're doomed!
Puppeteer::: The Ladybug doll, get it!
Lady Wifi::: Thanks Evillustrator! Now the doll!
Ladybug::: Is this what you want? Say pretty please! 
Puppeteer::: The doll! She got away with it! Get her!
Puppeteer::: Where'd she go!?
Ladybug::: First I gotta get rid of them, then Puppeteer!
Ladybug::: If you want this doll so badly, come and get it! 
Lady Wifi::: I'm faster than you! You're gonna lose, Ladybug!Gimme that doll! It's mine! 
Puppeteer::: I'm gonna get you Ladybug!
Cat Noir::: You'll be super duper sorry!
Ladybug::: Now that you're alone, I'm gonna huh!? Where is she!?
Puppeteer::: Now I'm the winner! Haha!
Ladybug::: Drop that doll, Manon!
Puppeteer::: I'm not Manon, I'm Puppeteer! 
Ladybug::: power strip appears.) A power strip? 
Puppeteer::: You've lost, Ladybug!
Ladybug:::There may be four of you but I'm twice as dangerous!
Puppeteer::: Ladybug, come to lif-
Ladybug::: No more evildoing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! 
Cat Noir::: What happened?
Ladybug::: You were a puppet! But don't worry, you didn't do anything foolish!
Cat Noir::: Good. And Ladybug, FYI, you can pull my heartstrings any day! 
Ladybug::: Hahaha! I think you were better when you sounded like a five-year-old girl!
Hawk Moth::: No! This cannot be happening! 
Nadja::: Manon!Thank you Ladybug! Thank you.
Ladybug::: It's time I bug out.
Marinette::: I'm sorry about what happened last time, Mrs. Chamack. I shouldn't have given her the doll after you told her no.
Nadja::: Manon can be pretty persuasive sometimes.
Marinette::: Yeah, with her...
Nadja::: Baby doll eyes? Yes, I know. See you later then. Kiss, Manon!
Manon:::Bye mommy!
Marinette::: See you later, Mrs. Chamack!
Nadja::: Buh-bye!
Manon::: I wanna play with Ladybug and Cat Noir!
Marinette:::I have a better idea. Why don't we go to the zoo today?
Manon::: But I wanna play with the dolls! Pretty please!
Marinette::: Don't even try it, Manon.
Manon:::I love the zoo! I'm ready!
