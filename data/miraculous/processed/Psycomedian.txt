Marinette::: Seriously, girls, I've tried multiple times, right?
The other girls:::Mhm.
Marinette::: Of course, in the beginning it was a total disaster.
Marinette::: I can't do it, I can't do it!
Alya:::No, you don't, girl. You've been stalling all morning. Now's the time!
Marinette::: Aaah!Um, haha! Hey! 
Adrien:::Hey.
Alya:::One of your best Marinette moments ever, no doubt.
Marinette::: But over time I've gotten better, haven't I?
Alix::: Like that time you were amazing at the Trocadéro?
Adrien::: But we can take you home if you want it.
Rose::: Whew...
Juleka::: All right!
Marinette::: No, it's okay! I'll take a coleslaw home. Thanks!
Adrien::: Okay... Enjoy your meal, then.See you at school tomorrow! 
Marinette::: Fine. So I've made zero progress.
Mylène::: That's not true, Marinette. Today, you and Adrien are friends! That's progress.
Adrien::: Is that true? We're still friends, you and me?
Marinette::: Of course! But to be safe, maybe we should stop playing pranks on each other.
Adrien:::I know. I'm not good with jokes. The girl I'm in love with doesn't like them either.
Marinette::: The girl that you- you're......you're in love with?
Marinette::: Becoming friends with Adrien is the worst thing that could've happened.
Juleka:::But you're special friends.
Rose::: You can't have love without friendship.
Marinette::: Okay! Adrien needs to see me in a new light! As more than just a funny duddy buddy. Not just a clumsy, babbling girl who trips over her words. I need to be different, so I'll be the apple of his eye, girl of his dreams, the one! Then we'll finally be together! I'll jump for joy! We'll dance in each other's arms! He'll sweep me off of my feet- Ah! Then, we'll get married, have three kids, and a hamster named-
Alya::: Marinette.
Marinette::: A hamster named Marinette? That'd be weird.
Alya::: Girl, you don't see the beauty of your flaws. Your awkward gaga goofiness is what makes you special! Don't try to be someone else, be Marinette!
Harry:::Ever wondered if you could recycle old socks? Try today's special in the cafeteria!Honk!
Nino::: See, dude? I told you! Hilarious, right?
Adrien::: Uh...Right! Really funny, Nino.
Nino::: I gotta show you his other sketches. It's insane that you don't know Harry Clown! 
Alya::: I've always loved Nino's sense of humor.
Marinette::: Of course! Laughter is the best medicine! If I can make Adrien laugh, I know he'd fall for me!
Nino::: Later, dude!
Adrien::: See you, Nino!
Marinette::: Why was Adrien laughing!? What was on your phone!? Come on, Nino! Tell me, please!
Nino::: Chill, girl! It was Harry Clown's sketch about cafeterias. So funny, you've heard of him?
Marinette::: Of course! He's even one of my parent's customers. He always comes to buy bread at 5 pm.Which is right now! 
Nino:::Uh... No problem! 
Harry::: Thanks, Sabine! Have a nice day, Tom!
Marinette:::Phew, you're still here!
Harry::: Marinette?
Marinette::: Harry, how much longer will you be doing your new act in Paris?
Harry::: My final performance is tonight!
Marinette::: Oh, shoot. Well that's that, I guess.
Harry::: Oh, but you've already seen it with your little family. Honk! 
Marinette::: Actually, it's not for me. It's for... for this Boy in my class, Adrien Agreste. He's a big fan of yours and... I thought he would've liked a chance to go to your show and we could've laughed together, side by side...
Harry::: You're just a little bit crazy about that Boy.Honk! 
Harry::: Well, I know Gaby pretty well!
Marinette::: Gaby?
Harry::: He designed the French fry costume for my first act years ago.
Marinette::: Gabriel made that? Wait. You know Adrien's father?!
Harry::: I'll talk to him. I'll promise you at the closing night, I'll have two special guests, you and your classmate whom you don't have a crush on at all. Honk!
Marinette::: Seriously? Oh, thank you, thank you! But, uh, what are you gonna say to convince him? Because, you know, Adrien cannot suspect anything, I mean—
Harry::: Trust me, Marinette.Honk!
Gabriel::: Why would Adrien want to see you on stage?
Harry::: Because I'd like to offer him... a role in my next movie!
Gabriel::: Super-Fry Saves The Day?
Harry::: This will be my most personal film. I wrote it all on my own. I even made some drawings! I brought back the character from my first show. Remember, Gaby? You did the costume.
Gabriel::: I thought we agreed never to mention that again.
Harry::: In the film, Super-Fry must save the day with his hero friends, Camembert Justice and Wonder Potato! Honk!
Gabriel::: A superhero comedy?
Harry::: Of course not, my dear Gaby! I'm done with silly jokes. This is a serious movie with strong emotions, love, sadness, and a real proper villain like Hawk Moth! I give you the power to be an evil French fry! Honk!
Harry::: I'm meeting with my producer tonight to present the project, and if Adrien were there too, I could introduce them after the show!
Gabriel::: I will have to approve the script if the project happens.
Harry::: Of course, Gaby!
Gabriel::: And I want all photographs of the fry costume I designed to disappear!
Harry::: No problem, my friend! Honk!
Gabriel::: No one will ever take him seriously.
Harry and Marinette::: He said yes!! He said yes!! He said yes!!
Marinette::: I really hope you'd be able to get your film produced, Harry. Thanks to you, I'll get to sit next to Adrien at his favorite comedian show! We'll have so much fun, laugh together, I can even tell some jokes. Except I don't know any jokes. He'll never find me as funny as you!
Harry::: Laughter is serious business, Marinette. But I'll help you.
Marinette::: Aren't you supposed to prepare for your meeting for your producer?
Harry::: Don't worry, my friend. Super-Fry always wins in the end. Honk!
Marinette::: Are you sure I can do this?
Harry::: We've rehearsed, and you're a natural, Marinette.
Marinette::: But every time I'm alone with him, I get so flustered and—
Harry::: You won't be alone. I'll stay right here. Honk!
Marinette::: What if he doesn't laugh?
Harry::: He will. You told me he knew my sketches. Of course, don't forget to always add the gimmick at the end. Honk! That's what gives rhythm to the sketch and lets the audience, I mean Adrien, know that's time to laugh. Yee-haw?
Marinette:::Yee-haw!
Adrien::: Marinette?
Marinette::: Oh! Adrien! You like Harry Clown too?
Adrien::: Uh, I've been invited, but I...
Marinette::: You think he'll do his sketch on the clumsy sheriff?
Adrien::: Uh... the clumsy who?
Marinette::: Ohhh! Oh, where did my hat go?
Adrien::: Uh... right there.
Marinette::: Yee-haw!
Marinette::: Oh, what? There it is!Silly old me!
Marinette::: Sorry.
Adrien::: Sorry.
Marinette::: Oh, there it is. Yee-haw...!
Harry::: Bob, hi!
Bob::: You're supposed to be here!
Harry::: Of course, I haven't forgotten. Just give me five minutes.
Bob::: We have a rehearsal!
Harry::: Yes, I understand, but—
Bob::: Get here now!
Harry::: Not even two minutes?
Bob::: No! Get here now!
Harry::: Fine. I'll be right there. Honk.
Marinette::: Check out my sheriff's star! Shiny, right? Yee-haw...?
Adrien::: You're acting kind of strange. Are you okay?
Marinette::: What? No, no, I'm fine. 
Marinette::: Look at the sheriff... Uh, I mean, the star!
Adrien::: Why'd you do that for?
Marinette::: I'm sorry. 
Adrien::: Hang on!
Harry::: And at the end, Super-Fry, Camembert Justice and Wonder Potato get thanked by the little guy they just saved and they all cry together.
Bob:::That's too funny!
Harry::: No, it's not! It's touching! It's a serious superhero movie, Bob.
Bob::: But you're a clown, Harry. No one wants you to make a drama. It will never bring us in as much money as your shows.
Harry::: I'm not doing this for the money. When I was a kid, I dreamed of being a superhero.
Bob:::Well, write a comedy sketch about it!
Harry::: No. I wanna speak to my public in a new wayto help people dream, to help them feel more emotions than just laughter.
Bob::: The only dreams I care about are the ones my piggy bank has about being filled with more money. Forget about your movie! It's a bad idea.Your public is waiting for you! 
Shadow Moth::: A comedian that no one takes seriously. How funny... and yet so sad. Time to take center stage.Fly away, my little Akuma, and evilize him!
Harry::: Oh! Marinette?
Marinette::: It was a total disaster. The worst day of my life. Adrien didn't laugh once. He must've thought I was so lame! Your meeting didn't go well either?
Audience::: Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry!
Stage manager::: Harry, it's time!
Harry:::I'm sorry, Marinette. The show must go on.
Shadow Moth:::Psycomedian, I am Shadow Moth. They refuse to believe that you can create other emotions besides laughter. Well, you're going to show them that no one can play with their emotions better than you!
Harry::: Trust me, my friend. I'll wipe the smiles off their faces.
Psycomedian::: So, it's true. You'll never take me seriously.
Adrien::: Talk about dark comedy.
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Bob::: Forty years in the business and I've never seen this. A comedian who doesn't wanna do comedy! Can you believe that!
Psycomedian::: Hey, Bob! Wanna laugh? I've got something for you!
Marinette::: Okay!
Marinette:::Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Psycomedian::: Where are you running to, Bob?
Civilian #1::: Hey!
Civilian #2::: Harry, you owe us a show!
Psycomedian::: I can fix that! You'd rather be laughing?Or crying? Boohoo! 
Ladybug::: You've lost your sense of humor, Harry.
Psycomedian::: I'd like to think I've gained a wide range of emotions, Ladybug. From now on, I am Psycomedian.
Cat Noir::: Cute name. I'm not sure how I'm feline about it.
Psycomedian::: From now on, people will take me seriously and tremble with fear! 
Ladybug::: Don't look at him!
Cat Noir::: No problem. I don't like creepy clowns faces anyway.
Psycomedian::: Thanks for the compliment.
Ladybug::: The Akuma could be in his red nose!
Cat Noir::: I'll take care of it. Cata-
Ladybug::: Not so fast! We need a plan to get close to him without making eye contact.
Psycomedian::: You wanna play cat and ladybug?
Cat Noir::: For a comedian, he's really not that funny.
Ladybug::: That's his problem actually. He doesn't wanna make people laugh anymore. makeup kit appears) A makeup case?
Cat Noir::: Perfect for going out in style.
Ladybug::: Of course! I can defeat him with my eyes closed.
Cat Noir::: You mean... literally?
Ladybug::: Yes. But you'll have to be my eyes, kitty. 
Cat Noir::: Clever, m'lady.
Psycomedian::: Huh? You lose, my friend!That's so sad! Boohoo! 
Ladybug:::Ohhh! Noooo!
Shadow Moth:::Such a beautiful emotion, Psycomedian. Seize her Miraculous!
Cat Noir::: Now, Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Boohoo! 
Psycomedian::: Hey! That's not fair!
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, now! 
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm! 
Ladybug::: No more evil-doing for you, li—What?!
Psycomedian:::You're just a couple of amateurs!
Psycomedian::: This time I've got you!
Ladybug::: You're gonna PAY FOR THAT, PSYCOMEDIAN!!!!!!!!
Cat Noir::: Ooooh! It was a bad idea to get her angry.
Cat Noir::: Hey! I didn't do anything!
Ladybug::: OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T!!! YOU NEVER DO!!!
Psycomedian::: Quite irritating, right, kitty? 
Cat Noir::: M'lady, things are looking up!
Ladybug::: HEY, LET GO OF ME RIGHT NOW!!! ARGH!!!!!
Shadow Moth:::Don't let them get away! Ladybug is right there!
Psycomedian::: If they want to defeat me, they'll have to come and see me playand I will choose the stage for their last performance. 
Cat Noir::: M'lady, Psycomedian made you lose control of your emotions. Just breathe. Calm down.
Ladybug::: I'M PERFECTLY CALM!!! YOU'RE THE ONE GETTING ON MY NERVES WITH YOUR KILLJOY KITTY ADVICE! UGH!! AND ALL THESE ADS, EVERYWHERE, THEY MAKE ME SICK!!! GRR...! GRR...!
Cat Noir::: We're about to detransform, we need to find—
Ladybug::: DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!!
Cat Noir::: Maybe once you transform, Psycomedian's spell will be broken.
Cat Noir::: Sorry, m'lady.
Psycomedian:::Here's Harry!
Bob::: Don't hurt me, Harry! I'm your producer!
Psycomedian::: I'm not here to hurt you, Bob. I'm here to make you laugh as that's all you expect from me!Now you'll take me seriously and do my movie, huh?
Bob:::Never! That's a stupid idea!
Psycomedian::: Read this scene and you'll see how touching it is!
Bob:::The only tears your audience will shed are tears of laughter!
Psycomedian::: Wanna bet? Boohoohoo!Unless you want to spend your whole life crying, agree to do my film!
Adrien::: Feeling any... better, m'lady—?
Marinette::: CAN'T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE FOR ONE SECOND?!?! TIKKI! FINISH YOUR MACAROON!!!
Tikki::: YOU THINK I'M HAVING FUN? I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, YOU KNOW! 
Adrien:::Maybe she'll calm down once she transforms again?
Plagg::: 
Ladybug::: LET ME OUT OF HERE!!!!!!
Cat Noir::: Who still wears belt bags these days? No joke.
Ladybug::: YOU'RE THE JOKE!!!
Cat Noir::: Hey! Maybe the Akuma's in something he keeps in there!
Ladybug::: OF COURSE THAT'S WHERE IT IS!! DUH!!! BUT WE HAVE TO IMMOBILIZE PSYCOMEDIAN IN ORDER TO SEARCH HIM! SET ME FREE ALREADY, SO I CAN USE MY POWERS!!!
Cat Noir::: Okay, but... I can trust you not to do anything reckless, right?
Ladybug::: RECKLESS? PROFESSOR RECKLESS CALLING ME RECKLESS??!? THAT'S A JOKE! GRR!!!
Ladybug::: LUCKY CHARM!!SERIOUSLY?!!!??!?! 
Cat Noir::: Why'd you just do that!? It was obvious for once! We just had to put it on Psycomedian's eyes to keep him from using his powers!
Ladybug::: YEAH, IT WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT IT MADE ME MAD!!! GRR!!! AND GIVE ME THAT RIDICULOUS BELT!!!
Cat Noir::: Hey, leave my costume out of it.
Civilian #3::: Hey!
Cat Noir::: Give us five minutes.
Psycomedian::: Have you become blind with rage, Ladybug?
Cat Noir::: Ha! That was funny!
Ladybug::: YOU! YOU'RE ABOUT TO REGRET MAKING ME ANGRY!!!
Psycomedian::: You got something on your shirt, kitty?!
Ladybug::: HE'S LYING!!!!!!!!! STAY FOCUSED!!!!!!!! HIII-YAAH!!!!!!! SO, ARE YOU DONE YET, KITTY!? OR DO I HAVE TO DO THIS ON MY OWN TOO?!?!?
Cat Noir::: Just a small touch right there... a little more there...
Ladybug::: WHAT, ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE COLORING INSIDE THE LINES?!!!??
Cat Noir::: There. He's immobilized. Let's go for the belt bag. Cataclysm! 
Ladybug::: THERE! IT'S OVER! EVERYONE CAN GO HOME NOW!!! TIME TO DE-EVILIZE!!!!GOTCHA!!!GET LOST, LITTLE BUTTERFLY!ALRIGHT ALREADY, MIRACULOUS LADYBUG!!!
Ladybug::: Phew.
Cat Noir::: Feeling better, m'lady?
Ladybug::: Yes. Thanks.
Ladybug::: This is a magical charm. As long as you carry it with you, you can't get akumatized again.
Harry::: Oh, thank you, Ladybug and Cat Noir. I really would've loved to have a superpower, just like you.
Ladybug::: But you do have one, Harry. You make people happy!
Harry::: I wish I could've touched their hearts.
Ladybug::: Joy is an emotion. Probably the most beautiful and hardest one to create.
Harry:::Hey, Bob!
Harry::: Listen, Bob. My superhero movie could be moving and fun too! People will cry laughing when they see it! What do you think? Honk!
Bob::: Heh.
Cat Noir::: Maybe you should think about getting a new producer.
Tikki::: Go on, Marinette. Just be yourself this time, and everything will go great.
Marinette::: Uh... Hey!
Adrien::: Hey!
Marinette::: Listen. I wanted to apologize for earlier in the line. I was trying to do Harry Clown's sketch, but... I don't have his natural comedic talent.
Adrien::: Well it was a bit awkward. But you're wrong! For example this morning at school when you were talking to the girls, I had no idea what you were saying, but you were gesturing wildly, like this, and like that! 
Marinette::: Wait a minute, you mean you weren't laughing at Harry Clown's sketch?
Adrien::: No, I don't think anyone can make me laugh more than Marinette Dupain-Cheng.
Marinette::: Oh, I make you laugh? Seriously?
Adrien::: Mhm.
