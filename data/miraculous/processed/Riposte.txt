Tikki::: This fencing gear really does suit you, Marinette.
Marinette::: Thank you, Tikki! Let's hope wielding a saber is a lot easier than finding a helmet that fits. 
Tikki::: 
Marinette:::I gotta ace these try-outs! D'Argencourt is the most prestigious fencing academy in all of Paris! I've only got this one shot to show them what I've got and get onto the team!
Tikki::: You've been reviewing the fencing rules all weekend, it's going to be great!
Marinette::: You're right. I'm going to make quite an impression on Adrien!Ah, here we go! This one should fit perfectly!
Armand::: I am the fencing master, Mr. D'Argencourt. As I'm sure you're aware, we have only one open spot on the team this year.So, in order to select the best possible candidate, I will observe the beginners performing a number of attacks on the experienced students.
Marinette:::Where's Adrien?
Armand:::Get into position.
Adrien::: Seems like you're looking for someone?
Marinette::: Yeah, I thought Adrien was here. You know, a Boy this tall , blond, nice, super handsome?
Adrien:::Thanks for the compliments!
Adrien::: I didn't know you were into fencing, Marinette.
Marinette::: A-Adrien! Nice to fencing, I'm totally into you! Uhh, I mean, nice to see you! Yeah, I'm totally into fencing.
Adrien::: 
Armand::: Get into position!
Marinette::: .
Adrien::: Bend your knees, then stretch your left foot back, turned outwards.Perfect!Now, put your saber forward, like this.
Marinette::: 
Armand::: Greet each other! 
Armand::: En garde! Prêt, allez!
Adrien:::Go on, Marinette. You're supposed to touch me.
Marinette:::Touch you?! Yeah...
Armand::: Attaque! Touche. Point!Continue!
Marinette:::Thanks!
Adrien:::All I did was lunge. You've got good reflexes!En garde!
Marinette::: 
Adrien::: Prêt, allez!
Adrien::: Attack, parry, riposte, counterattack. The point goes to you, Marinette.
Marinette:::I don't get it. You hit me first.
Adrien:::With saber fencing, the attacker doesn't necessarily win the point even though he touched his opponent first. You took the initiative, so we say that you had priority. I can only parry or riposte, so I lose.
Marinette::: But everything's happening so fast, I mean, how can you know who won the point?
Adrien::: We don't always know for sure. That's why you can also abstain. Shall we continue? 
Kagami::: Hey, you! Are you Mr. D'Argencourt, the fencing master? I wanna join your team.
Armand::: Only the best are admitted here, you knave.
Kagami::: And I was, everywhere I went.
Armand::: Part le fer! This whippersnapper has nerve! All right! I may consider your admission, shall you defeat one of my students.
Kagami:::Which one of you is the best combatant?!
Armand::: Adrien, please give our visitor a lesson in chivalry.
Adrien:::I shall, Master.
Marinette:::Great. There goes any chance I had of making the team. This guy's obviously better than everyone.
Student to Marinette's left::: It's not over yet, he still has to beat Adrien.
Armand::: Prêt... allez!
Armand::: Simultané! Par un toucher!
Marinette::: I could have sworn Adrien touched him first...
Student to Marinette's left::: Not sure. Anyway, you never question the referee's decision.
Armand::: En garde! Prêt... allez!
Armand:::Uhh... Abstention!
Marinette::: What's happening?
Student to Marinette's left::: Mr D'Argencourt isn't sure who won, so he's chosen to abstain. This is a tight bout.
Armand::: En garde!
Kagami::: Wait. I request that we do it the old-fashioned way. We'll be much more at ease without the machine.
Armand::: Adrien?
Adrien::: Fine with me. 
Marinette:::But how will we know who touched the other one first?
Student on Marinette's right::: By watching very closely.
Armand::: En garde... Prêt... allez!
Marinette:::Is this what fencing's all about?!
Armand:::Part le fer! This IS what fencing's all about!
Kagami::: Is that all you can do?
Armand::: The fateful moment has arrived! 
Armand:::Let me through! Move! 
Kagami::: Let's finish this off!
Kagami::: Who got the first hit?! Who?!
Marinette::: Uhhh, I...!
Armand:::Who touched first? Tell us now!
Marinette::: I don't know! I think... ... It was... Adrien?
Armand:::Ah-ha, wonderful! This victory is an honor to D'Argencourt Academy!
Kagami::: 
Adrien:::Are you sure, Marinette?
Marinette::: Uh, um... Well, I'm not entirely sure. I mean, it looked like it was you, but it went so fast.
Adrien:::I think he touched me first.
Armand::: The referee has the last word.
Hawk Moth::: A champion whose victory has been stolen... Crushing defeat is the ideal steel with which to form a blade of revenge.Fly away, my little akuma, towards this spite and petulance, and evilize that fencer! 
Adrien::: I'm going to offer him a decisive match.Hey! Wait! Your saber!
Adrien:::Let's do a... decisive match? 
Kagami::: What's the point? You won. There's no such thing as a second chance in my family. Goodbye. 
Adrien::: H-Hey! What's your name?!
Tikki::: You might have a chance on the fencing team after all!
Adrien:::Follow that car!
Marinette:::An akuma!Better capture it before it turns someone into a villain!
Tikki::: At your service, Marinette!
Marinette::: Quick! Adrien is in danger!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Tomoe:::I'm not available at the moment. Leave a message. 
Kagami::: Mother, you thought I was good enough, but... I lost. I won't be joining the D'Argencourt Academy.
Hawk Moth::: Riposte! I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you a second chance to prove that you are the best fencer of all, but in return, you must bring me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.
Kagami::: On my honor, Hawk Moth, I shall be victorious! 
Adrien::: She's the only daughter belonging to a family of prestigious fencers. Her mother and grandfather were both world champions. I've read about them before! She and her mother just moved to Paris! How incredible!
Riposte::: I'm taking you up on your offer of a decisive match!
Adrien::: I- I can't fight you like this! You're not... yourself.
Riposte::: Fight!
Hawk Moth::: Halt, Riposte! You make seek your revenge, but only after you take hold of Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous first.
Riposte::: Understood, Hawk Moth.
Riposte::: Where do you think you're going? Stay there. Nice and patiently.
Ladybug::: How'd you like to start a duel with me?It's merged with her hand.
Riposte::: Give me a moment, Adrien. I must finish her off, first! But don't worry- I haven't forgotten about you! I won't be long.
Adrien::: Don't let her close in on you! Fight back!
Ladybug::: Thank you, but now get out of here. She doesn't deserve you. 
Adrien::: Watch out Ladybug!Ouch! 
Ladybug::: Are you hurt?
Adrien::: I'm fine.
Ladybug::: I need to get you as far away from that girl as possible.
Adrien::: Sounds like a plan.
Ladybug::: What kind of fencing was that?
Adrien::: Nothing like I've ever seen before.
Ladybug::: It's going to be hard for me to fight and protect you at the same time.Where are you, Cat Noir?
Adrien::: Maybe he's busy?
Riposte::: Allow me to explain the rules to you- you're not allowed to call it quits at any time! Adrien is mine! I will defeat you. Both of you! I am the best fencer!
Adrien::: Nobody's denying that. My friend Marinette made a bad call earlier.
Ladybug::: He's right. Referee errors can happen in fencing. You don't have to get so bent out of shape about it.
Riposte::: 
Adrien::: I'm sure Marinette wasn't trying to humiliate you.
Ladybug:::Of course not! 
Adrien::: Uhh... 
Ladybug:::I mean, I'm sure that was the case.
Riposte::: It's too late! The damage has been done! This time, I shall be the referee! 
Ladybug::: Stay back, Adrien. 
Plagg::: You're sure taking some risks today.
Adrien::: Don't really have a choice do I? Ladybug needs me.
Adrien::: Plagg, c-! 
Ladybug::: Adrien, you okay? 
Adrien::: Uhh, yeah, and you?
Ladybug::: I'll feel better once your safe, far away from that girl. Come on, let's go.
Ladybug::: Akuma alert! You must leave now! Evacuate the premesis calmly!
Officer Roger::: This way ladies and gentlemen. 
Announcement::: Akuma Alert. Ladybug and Cat Noir are expected to handle this emergency swiftly. All visitors kindly vacate the premises very calmly. Thank you.
Ladybug::: A safe place, a safe place... There!
Ladybug::: I'm sorry, but at least you'll be safe in here! 
Adrien:::Please be careful, Ladybug.
Ladybug::: Oh... I'll be fine. Thank you, and you stay out of harm's way, okay? 
Riposte::: Where did you hide Adrien?!
Ladybug::: You actually think I'd tell you? This is just between you and me, Riposte!
Riposte::: You can't cut it? Fine. I'm going to defeat you and take your Miraculous! Then I'll go and find him!
Ladybug::: I won't let you lay a hand on him!
Adrien::: It's time we went and joined Ladybug.
Plagg::: Didn't you hear what she said? She said to wait here! You can't disobey her!
Adrien::: I've gotta help her!
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Riposte::: Cat Noir!
Cat Noir::: A fencing tournament at the Louvre? How come I wasn't invited?
Ladybug:::Let me guess: you were late because you were at the groomers again?
Cat Noir::: I was preening myself, M'lady. You know how long it takes cats to get ready.
Ladybug::: Checkmate, Riposte!
Riposte::: You've got the wrong sport, Ladybug! I think you mean: attaque toi! 
Ladybug:::You okay, Cat Noir?
Cat Noir::: Ladybug!
Riposte::: Ready to lose, Ladybug? 
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm! 
Riposte::: Of course.The hour of revenge has struck!
Ladybug::: No!
Ladybug::: He's gone!
Cat Noir:::Uhh, who?
Ladybug::: Riposte is trying to get revenge on Adrien Agreste! I hid him inside the sarcophagus!
Cat Noir::: Maybe he was feeling a little... claws-trophobic?
Ladybug::: 
Riposte::: Let's look for him together, Ladybug- and finish this match! 
Ladybug::: Grr!radiator falls down into her hands.) A radiator?
Cat Noir::: Great. That should really heat things up.
Ladybug::: Hmph.The akuma has to be in her sword!
Cat Noir::: Then why don't we get to the point?
Ladybug::: 
Cat Noir::: Grrr, she's too quick!
Ladybug::: I need your belt, Cat Noir!
Cat Noir::: Get ready!En garde! 
Ladybug::: Prêt...!
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: Allez!
Ladybug:::No more evildoing for you, little akuma.Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little butterfly!Miraculous Ladybug!
Kagami::: What happened?
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: Pound it!
Cat Noir::: Gotta go. Have a vet's appointment to get to. Take care of the young lady, will you? 
Ladybug:::Everything's okay.
Cat Noir:::Claws in.
Plagg:::Ohhhh... All this sport has made me hungryyyyy.
Adrien::: Later. Shh! 
Ladybug::: You go on. I have to find someone.
Kagami::: Thanks. 
Ladybug::: Where could he have gone?
Adrien:::Ladybug?
Ladybug:::There you are!
Adrien::: Yeah, I'm sorry. I figured it would be better to escape before Riposte came along. Besides, I...... hate to be locked up. 
Ladybug:::I'm so sorry! You did the right thing. 
Adrien:::S-so, uh... So Cat Noir finally turned up, huh?
Ladybug::: Yes, thankfully! Between you and me, he's much better at fencing! 
Adrien:::And... Riposte?
Ladybug::: The girl is safe.Oh no! I'm about to change back!You should be the one to return that.
Ladybug::: Bug out! 
Announcement::: The Akuma Alert has been called off. The Louvre will soon be opening. Thank you for your cooperation.
Kagami:::I'm at the Louvre. Come when you can. 
Adrien::: Excuse me?
Kagami::: Listen, I- 
Adrien and Kagami::: I'm sorry. 
Adrien:::Perhaps you'll agree to take this back now?
Kagami:::No, I lost. You keep it.
Adrien::: I personally think the point was yours.
Kagami::: That's not what your friend saw.
Adrien::: Marinette can get flustered easily. She's kind and means well. She'd never cheat. Today was her first-ever experience with fencing.
Kagami:::You like her a lot, huh?
Adrien::: Marinette? Yeah, of course! She's a very good friend, and you'll really like her too, once you get to know her.
Tikki::: That sounds like a good start to me!
Adrien::: Please, take it. 
Kagami:::I'll be happy to get to know your friend Marinette! 
Adrien::: My name's Adrien. What's yours?
Kagami::: Kagami.Get ready for that decisive match!
Adrien::: I can't wait, Kagami.
Tikki::: At least now you know how much Adrien values your friendship.
Marinette:::I know! Great, so he likes me. But I don't want him to just like me. I mean- I do, but, you know, I want him to LIIIIIIKE me! 
Tikki::: In that case, you might have to work on your fencing!
Marinette:::On your guard, Tikki!
