Sabine::: Well? With or without?
Marinette::: Uh, with?
Sabine::: You're sure it's not better without?
Marinette::: Either way, you look perfect, Mom.
Sabine::: You know? It's not every day you celebrate your twentieth wedding anniversary.
Tom:::Marinette! Could you have a minute, please?Well?
Marinette::: Well, what?
Tom::: My mustache, I groomed it. Is it too short? Should I shave the whole thing off? Maybe it's a little crooked on one–
Marinette::: You look perfect, Dad. Uh, except for one thing. 
Tom::: Uh? Thanks, sweetheart. 
Marinette:::No problem Dad! 
Marinette::: You're going to be late!
Tom::: Now don't forget Mrs. Chamack will be coming by to pick up the Eiffel Tower cake in 30 minutes. I'm depending on you.
Marinette::: Yeah, yeah. No sweat, piece of cake.Wow, married twenty years. That's pretty cool, huh Tikki?
Tikki::: Time flies when you're having fun.
Marinette::: And stands still when you're doing homework. 
Alix::: They're Marinette's parents. You know, one of the chicks I hang out with?
Mr. Kubdel::: Yes, I remember. They make the best bread in the whole of Paris.Couldn't you have made more of an effort to dress nicely?.
Alix::: What do you mean? I took off my cap.
Mr. Kubdel::: But this is a special day.
Alix::: Well, it's only a birthday.
Mr. Kubdel::: No, this is a special birthdayThis family heirloom was made by one of our ancestors many, many years ago. It's been passed down from one generation to the next, on their 15th birthday. And today, it's your turn to inherit it.
Alix::: It's pretty sweet, dad. But I've already got a watch, synced up to my smartphone.
Mr. Kubdel::: But sometimes there's more to things than meets the eye. Let's just say that our ancestor was…Ahead of his time. 
Mr. Kubdel::: Of course, I'd understand if you'd rather me buy you a new pair of rollerblades.
Alix::: No, Dad! I'm stoked to have it. It's awesome, thank you! 
Mr. Kubdel::: Are your friends waiting?
Alix::: Yeah, but I don't wanna bail on you. It's cool.
Mr. Kubdel::: No, no, go ahead.Now, take good care of it.
Tikki::: Come on Marinette! You can do it! Just remember the formula. Think, Marinette, think!
Marinette::: I might be able to do it if you weren't distracting me so much with your encouraging words! 
Marinette::: Hey Alya. What's up? The what? The bet between Alix and Kim? No, of course, I didn't forget! I already made the banner for it! I know everyone's counting on me. In 5 minutes?! No sweat. I'm on my way already. Be right there! Eek!
Tikki::: But Marinette, you have to wait for Mrs. Chamack to pick up her cake!
Marinette::: Gahhh! I've got 20 minutes before she gets here. I told them I'd take care of the banner and they're all counting on me! Besides, Adrien will be there too!
Tikki::: You'll never make it to Trocadéro on 5 minutes, it's way too far!
Marinette::: Not too far for Ladybug.Tikki, spots on!
Unknown::: Oh, that's beautiful!
Adrien::: Impressive, Marinette! 
Kim::: You all picked the wrong side to cheer on. Looks like Alix isn't even showing up! Probably too chicken to race an extreme athlete like me.
Alix::: Spoke too soon, Kim.Your ridiculous bets are over. I'm gonna leave you in the dust, meathead!
Kim::: You're no match for me. My neck is bigger than your thigh.
Alya:::Is that a good thing?
Marinette::: 
Max:::Let's review the official rules. Two laps around the fountains; approximately 500 yards. The first one over the line's declared the victor! If Kim triumphs, Alix will relinquish her rollerblades to him. If Alix triumphs, Kim will be prohibited from making another dare for the rest of the school year.
Juleka::: We're through with all of those stupid dares!
Ivan::: Uh-huh, that's right!
Nathaniel::: No more dares!
Max::: On your marks, get set...
Alix::: Hold up! 
Kim::: Forfeiting already?
Alix:::Hold on to this for me, will you, Alya? I don't wanna drop it during the race.
Alya::: Hold on girl, I can't! I gotta...
Alix::: Guard it with your life. It's a family heirloom!
Alya::: But...Marinette, take this. I gotta record the race for my blog!
Max::: On your marks, get set... GO!
Marinette::: But... she asked you to look after it. I gotta hold up the banner!
Adrien::: Need any help?
Marinette::: Uh... yup! Thanks. Gotta be careful! Even if you are amazing.
Adrien::: Uh?
Marinette::: At... holding things! In your hands. 
Max::: Last lap!
Alya::: Amazing at holding things?
Marinette::: 
Chloé::: Adrikins, whatcha got there? Some super old case or something?
Adrien::: Careful, it's Alix's!
Chloé::: If it's Alix's, it's probably worthless.
Marinette::: Give it back to Adrien, Chloé. 
Alix::: Yeah! Hahaha! 
Kim::: I call a rematch. That false start back there threw me off! Uh...
Alix:::Ugh! Did you do this?!
Alya::: I had to videotape the race so I gave it to Marinette but then she had to hold the banner so she gave it to Adrien, then Chloé snatched it from him and dropped it and, uh, then you skated over it. Hehe
Alix:::My old man gave me this for my birthday! This watch is totally a family heirloom!
Marinette::: It was an accident!
Adrien::: We didn't mean any harm, Alix.
Chloé::: As if! I totally had nothing to do with this.
Alix:::You're all to blame! 
Marinette::: Alix, wait!
Tikki::: Marinette, what about Ms. Chamack's cake?
Marinette::: There's still time! Hide, Tikki! 
Hawk Moth::: Such disappointment, frustration and negativity... Oh, how it fills my heart with exhilaration.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her!
Butler Jean::: Bon appetite.
Tom:::It's Mrs. Chamack.Hello?
Nadja::: Hi, I'm in front of the bakery.
Tom::: Yes, I...
Nadja::: But it's closed! And I really need that cake now!
Tom::: I know you need your cake right away. Uh, my daughter's home, she must be upstairs. I'll phone her immediately. 
Marinette::: Maybe we could fix it?
Alix::: This watch was sick! One of a kind! It can't be fixed!
Marinette::: Well, there has to be a way to get it back to the way it was.
Alix::: Like how, huh? Go back in time and change the future? When you figure out how to do that, lemme know! 
Marinette:::Uh-oh, this can't be good.Hello, dad...
Hawk Moth::: Timebreaker. I am Hawk Moth. I'm granting you the power to retaliate against the people who've wronged you and to go back in time to restore the future. But you must do me a favor in return when the time is right.
Timebreaker::: You got it, Hawk Moth.
Tom::: Mrs. Chamack is outside waiting to take her cake.
Marinette::: Uhh... I...I gotta go, dad. Can't keep Ms. Chamack waiting!
Tom::: She was listening to music.
Adrien::: Run!
Marinette::: Stop, Alix! What are you doing?!
Timebreaker::: The name's Timebreaker now. And I'm gonna go back in time and save my watch, using all you punks to do it!
Marinette::: Go back in time? What did you do to Kim? Why is he fading?
Timebreaker::: I needed his energy. Besides, the dude was a pain anyway with all those bets. He deserves to disappear forever. And so do you! 
Marinette:::We gotta transform, now!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Yeah!
Ladybug::: Time out, Timebreaker!
Timebreaker::: Please, help me up, I messed up, please, please! 
Rose::: Okay.
Ladybug::: Noooo!
Timebreaker:::Hahaha! Sweet Rose! Always thinking of others before yourself!One minute.
Ladybug::: I gotta destroy her akuma before everyone disappears for good! Where on earth is that cat? 
Adrien:::Time to transform!
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Timebreaker::: One and a half minutes. You won't be able to stop me where I'm going, Ladybug!
Cat Noir:::Let me guess. We're all playing a game of tag and you're it?
Timebreaker::: Exactly!
Ladybug::: Don't let her touch you!
Cat Noir:::Missed me! Just a second too late.
Timebreaker:::He he he he! 
Ladybug::: Nooo!
Cat Noir::: Well, she wastes no time, does she?
Ladybug:::And the more people she freezes, the more minutes she gets to go farther back in time! Those poor kids frozen in time...They're goners if we don't get that akuma!
Ivan::: Ahhh!
Ladybug:::Keep your hands to yourself! 
Hawk Moth::: Now, Timebreaker! Grab her Miraculous! Her earrings!
Ladybug:::Cat Noir! Noooo! 
Timebreaker::: Oh, wow, six minutes in one go! Must have been those nine lives. Gotta go! The past is waiting.
Hawk Moth::: Timebreaker! The Miraculous! Take Cat Noir's ring before he disappears!
Timebreaker:::Uh...
Ladybug::: Go ahead and try! 
Timebreaker::: Chill out, Hawk Moth. I have a sick plan!
Ladybug::: Wh-What... just happened?Oh wow, we've gone back in time, haven't we?
Chloé::: Whatcha got there?
Adrien::: Careful, it's Alix's!
Chloé::: What is this? Some super old case or something? If it's Alix's, it's probably worthless.
Marinette::: Give it back to Adrien, Chloé.
Timebreaker:::My watch!! 
Ladybug::: Chloé! Put the watch down!
Timebreaker::: NOOOO!!Ladybug! This time it's your fault!I need more energy. I gotta go further back in time! 
Past Alix::: Ladybug...! It's all Ladybug's fault!
Hawk Moth::: Could this be possible? Do I see double vision in my future? Or should I say, double villain?Fly away, my devilish akuma, then join this troubled soul!
Ladybug::: Everyone, get out of here! Don't let her touch you! 
Adrien::: Time to transform.
Past Marinette::: Who are you? 
Ladybug::: Uhh, I don't really have time to explain right now, but I'm you from just a few minutes in the future. 
Past Tikki::: She's right! I can feel it! She is you from the future!
Past Marinette::: Crazy!
Ladybug::: Listen. I know it seems unbelievable, but trust me, I mean, trust...yourself? Oh, and dad's gonna call me! I mean, you, in two minutes! He won't be happy because Ms. Chamack is waiting for you outside the bakery door!
Past Marinette::: The cake... But I, I still have...
Ladybug::: Time? That's what I thought too. Ms. Chamack will be early. Just leave now and make sure to take care of the cake. Don't worry, Ladybug can handle this single-handed.How did I get myself into these crazy situations? 
Ladybug:::Cat Noir, I can't explain now, but we've got to capture Timebreaker's akuma! Your life depends on it!
Cat Noir::: Which life? I've got nine.
Ladybug::: I'm serious! The akuma is in her rollerblades. We gotta release it!
Cat Noir::: Am I seeing double all of a sudden?
Ladybug::: Another thing I don't have time to explain.
Timebreaker 1::: The energy from these two will be enough for both of us to go farther back in time!
Timebreaker 2::: Heh, I want my watch back! Let's do it!
Ladybug::: Whatever you do, don't let either of them touch you!
Hawk Moth::: Get the Miraculous, Timebreaker!
Timebreaker 1::: If we were faster, those bozos would be no match for us.
Timebreaker 2::: Then let's stock up on more energy first. Then, we'll destroy them!
Ms. Chamack:::Oh, hold on. Here she comes now. It's fine, thanks.
Tom::: It's all good.
Past Marinette::: Sorry again for making you wait.Hahh...
Past Tikki::: Mission accomplished.
Past Marinette::: You mean Mission #1 accomplished, time for Mission #2!
Past Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Yeah!
Timebreaker 1::: We've got enough speed. Let's go hardcore on Ladybug and Cat Noir!
Timebreaker 2::: Once we get the energy from these two...
Timebreaker 1::: We'll have enough to go back in time together.
Timebreaker 2::: And get our watch!
Cat Noir::: I thought we were chasing them!
Timebreakers::: Hyaaahhh!
Past Ladybug::: Hey, you two! Need a hand?
Ladybug::: Thanks!
Cat Noir::: Uh... uh?
Past Ladybug::: They're insane on their rollerblades.
Ladybug::: And unstoppable on the ground!
Past Ladybug::: So, what if they were not on the ground?
Cat Noir::: Two Ladybugs? I'm in heaven!
Timebreaker 1::: Change of plan. We gotta go back in time now. There'll be less of them!
Timebreaker 2::: I'm down.
Hawk Moth::: Don't fail me this time!
Ladybugs::: They're planning to go back in time again! Lucky Charm!Any ideas?
Cat Noir::: While you two figure it out, I'll try to buy us some time.
Ladybug::: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Past Ladybug::: Of course!
Cat Noir:::Cataclysm! 
Timebreakers::: Huh? 
Timebreaker 1::: Let's freeze her on her way past!
Timebreakers::: We're going too fast! We can't stop!
Timebreakers::: Hyaaahhh!
Ladybug::: Now!
Ladybugs:::No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug!Pound it! 
Alix::: Huh?
Ladybug::: Here. I think this is yours? 
Alix::: Sweet! How did you fix it? Thank you! I should never have given it to someone else to look after. It was my responsibility. My bad.
Ladybug::: Responsibility isn't something to be taken lightly. I should know.
Alix::: You're totally right. I'll be more careful next time for sure. Thanks, Ladybug.
Cat Noir::: I was just getting used to having two Ladybugs around.
Ladybug::: But now, you're gonna get used to no Ladybugs around. Gotta split before I change back. 
Cat Noir::: Ahhh... She'll fall for me someday. It's just a matter of time.
Hawk Moth::: You slipped by me this time, Ladybug and Cat Noir. But one day, past, present, or future... you will be destroyed! And I'll have your Miraculouses! I will be UNSTOPPABLE! Mwahahaha!
Marinette::: Huh? Hey! So, did you have a nice anniversary?
Tom::: We sure did. Although, it was a close call.
Marinette::: Huh? Oh, yeah! Hehehe. Ms. Chamack. I'm so sorry that I kept her waiting.
Sabine::: Next time, please wait for the customer in the bakery and not in your room, listening to your loud music!
Marinette::: Got it. I promise I won't screw up next time.
Tom::: Good, cause Mom's right. There's only one Marinette, and we're counting on her.
