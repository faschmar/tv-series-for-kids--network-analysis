Plagg::: Whoa! 
Nathalie:::Ready to go, Adrien?
Adrien:::Nathalie, since this is gonna take a while, can I bring a friend? 
Nathalie:::Hmm.
Nino::: Whassup, bro?
Adrien::: Nino, I've got to go back to the Grévin Wax Museum. Do you want to come with me this time?
Nino::: Sure thing, dude. I'll be right there—Uh, eh, actually, Alya and I are hanging together today.Wait! Do you think Alya could come too?
Adrien::: Can I bring two friends? 
Nathalie:::Hmm.
Alya::: Hey, wait! 
Marinette::: Hey, girl.
Alya::: Marinette, you are coming with me and Nino to the Grévin Wax Museum. Adrien invited us!
Marinette::: Ah! Wha! But! Nuh—!
Alya::: There's no saying no. We're coming to get you now. You don't have a choice, girl!
Nino:::Do you think Marinette could come too? That way you two guys could—
Alya::: Shhh!
Nino::: Uh, you could... stare at the statues together! Marinette loves the... she loves statues! Which is perfect since the wax museum is, uh, full of them! 
Adrien::: Can we make that... three? 
Nathalie:::Mhmm.
Manon::: But Marinette!What about my superhero costume?Hmph, everyone always forgets about me.
Marinette::: Sorry, guys. I'm looking after Manon this afternoon. Go ahead without me.
Adrien::: Would four work? Actually, more like three and a half.
Nathalie::: I'll see what I can do.
Alya:::You leave Adrien alone, and then, I'll leave Marinette alone...
Manon::: Hey! Why are you leaving Marinette all alone? Don't you like her?
Marinette::: Huh, what're you guys talking about?
Nino::: Nothing! It's got nothing to do with us leaving you and Adrien alone...Uh...! To... look at the statues as, uh, just friends, of course. 
Adrien::: Don't worry, Manon. It's just that Alya and Nino are Boyfriend and girlfriend, and they probably wanna spend some time alone together. Without us. 
Manon::: Really? But I thought you and Marinette were Boyfriend and girlfriend.She has lots of photos of you all over her bedroom.
Adrien:::That's because she loves fashion and I'm a fashion model.
Manon::: But then why are there so many hearts drawn on them?
Marinette:::Those aren't heart! Those are, uh, upside-down spades! I was just coming up with some new, uh, patterns, for my fabric designs.You told me you wouldn't tell Nino!
Alya::: I haven't told him. Right, Nino? I didn't tell you anything. 
Nino::: She didn't tell me. And besides, I told her I won't tell.
Marinette::: So you didn't tell anyone what Alya didn't tell you. Or did you?
Manon::: What are you guys talking about?
Marinette, Nino, & Alya::: Nothing.
Adrien::: Hi, Véronique.
Véronique::: Thanks for coming on such short notice, Adrien. I'm sorry, but a piece of your statue went missing yet again!Just goes to show how popular you are.
Manon::: Look Marinette, we get to go in, even though it's closed! It's like we're princesses.Hey! Did you hear me? 
Alya:::Be careful this time, right? Marinette's the only one that's gotta spill the beans to Adrien— not us! So no matter what Adrien asks you, just deny. Okay? 
Manon:::Ahaha, wheee!Mr. Jagged! Can you give me an 'autygraph,' please?Why isn't anyone paying attention to me today!?
Véronique:::That's because this isn't the real Jagged. It's a wax statue of him. The Grévin Wax Museum is the kingdom of illusions!
Manon::: Woah! But he looks for reals! 
Véronique:::The museum opened in 1882. We have about 200 wax statues on exhibition at any one time. We bring new celebrities in on a regular basis, the most recent one being Adrien!
Adrien:::So if I've got this right, you and Alya wanna spend some alone time together, yeah?
Flashback Alya::: So no matter what Adrien asks you, just deny.
Nino::: Not at all! That's not why we came here at all.
Adrien::: Oh! Well, then it's real nice of you guys to come here just to keep me company. 
Nino::: That's not why we came here at all, either!
Adrien::: Really? So why did you want to come here then? Did it have something to do with Marinette?
Nino::: Uh, no! You've got it all wrong, dude.Not with Marinette, or with you, and even less with you and Marinette alone by yourselves! 
Adrien::: I'm confused. Marinette wants to be alone with me?
Nino:::Marinette alone with you? Uh, no way, dude! You couldn't be further from the truth. It's the exact opposite, actually. 
Adrien::: Marinette doesn't want to be with me? 
Marinette::: Ah! Manon, come here! 
Adrien::: Does she hate me?
Nino::: No, no! Dude, she likes you a lot! I mean, no! I mean, yes? I mean... barely! She barely likes you a lot, so there you have it. 
Adrien::: You sure? I'd be really bummed if I knew Marinette didn't like me. 
Véronique::: The museum opened in 1882. We have about 200 wax statues...
Marinette::: Why did you tell Nino everything? You promised you wouldn't.
Alya::: I didn't, I swear! Besides, even if I had told him everything, he would still be clueless. Ugh! Who cares anyway? I've set everything up with Nino, who doesn't know a thing, so you can finally pour your heart out to Adrien, girl! 
Marinette::: Wait, what?
Alya::: We'll take off, leaving you two solo. Then you can spill your beans.
Marinette::: Ah! Ahh! 
Nino:::Not with Marinette, or with you, and even less with you and Marinette alone by yourselves! 
Marinette::: No! Not like that! I'm so not ready. I'd have to practice first, and wash my hair, and I'm not even wearing my lucky socks. 
Alya::: It's up to you, girl. But I'm just telling you: today's the day.
Marinette:::Manon, come here! 
Manon:::Look, Marinette! My mommy's a famous person too. 
Marinette::: Yeah. Yeah, right. Okay. 
Véronique::: Welcome to the workshop! This is where our sculptors create and repair all of our statues.And this is where we store our wax. It comes straight from our very own beehives up on the roof of the museum. 
Théo::: So I heard we have to do your hand again. Right, Véronique?
Véronique:::Mmhmm.
Nino:::The beard's really well done.
Théo::: It's genuine yak hair. 
Véronique:::Okay, we have to leave you for a while, if you don't mind.
Théo:::It'll ding when it's over. We'll be back as soon as possible. 
Adrien::: Take your time. 
Manon:::Oh! I didn't know Nino was a famous person, too!
Nino::: Boo!
Manon:::My turn! My turn! I wanna play statues, too! Marinette!C'mon! Let's go and play hide and seek and statues in the museum!
Marinette::: We can't, Manon. We came here to keep Adrien company. 
Alya::: We'll play with you. Marinette, you take good care of Adrien. He must not get bored a single second!
Marinette::: Uh, what? But I—! No! Don't leave me alone with him!I mean— That's not what I meant to say... I just... I...
Adrien::: Are you mad at me, Marinette?
Marinette:::No! Of course not. Why would you say that?
Adrien::: Because, Nino told me...
Marinette::: I have no idea what Nino told you, but whatever he said, it's totally not true.
Adrien::: Oh, so that means you like me, right? I was afraid you didn't like me.
Marinette::: Of course I like you... Well, like, uh, like! But, not like that!What I mean is, you're not exactly a 'good friend,' you know?
Adrien:::Uh, okay...But then, if I'm not a good friend, what am I to you?
Marinette::: You're...Toilets! I— I really gotta go to the toilet now. Eee! 
Adrien::: See you later.
Plagg:::Oooh, Aadrieeen! What is it with the girrrls?? At least you don't have these kinds of troubles with cheeeese!
Adrien:::Stop pranking, Plagg. Put that head back down before you cataclysm it. 
Adrien:::I'm sure I did something to mess up our friendship by accident. I'm so clueless about these things! 
Plagg:::Huh?
Adrien:::I gotta make it up to her. 
Alya:::Manon, where are you hiding!? 
Nino::: Wow!Excuse me, lady, what exactly is your superpower, making me fall super in love?
Alya::: I don't need a super power for that.I know that we're not really ourselves when we're akumatized, but it's... weird to see ourselves like that, as supervillians.
Nino::: It's because you don't look at them properly. These aren't supervillains, these are all the people Ladybug and Cat Noir have saved.
Alya::: You're right.Hey! What're you doing?
Nino::: Oooh! I've been akumatized, now I'm Tickle Man!
Alya:::No, not the tickles!Help! Ladybug, Cat Noir! 
Nino:::I'm gonna tickle!
Manon::: Come on, what about me!? Why doesn't anyone wanna play with me? 
Hawk Moth::: A little girl who feels all alone. Children cannot be disregarded. Well, she can count on me to give her my full attention.Fly away, my little akuma, and prey on her despair! .
Hawk Moth:::Puppeteer, glad to see you again. So, no one wants to play with you, huh? I'm giving you the power to play with them!
Manon:::We'll have lots of fun! 
Marinette:::Uhhh! I'm so tired of not being able to just tell him how I feel! But I'm so scared, Tikki, always so scared he'll reject me.
Tikki::: You're overthinking it. You should try a game where you play a different character!
Marinette::: Like... like role playing?
Tikki::: Yes! And you're playing a super cool character who's not afraid of anything!
Marinette::: Yeah! Role playing!I can do that!
Plagg::: Seriously, who cares about friendship?
Adrien::: Marinette's important to me, so I'll do whatever it takes to make her feel good when she's around. 
Plagg::: Like, giving her cheese? 
Adrien::: Like, cheering her up! Making her laugh, doing pranks like you always do for me.Hm? 
Marinette:::I'm super cool... I'm super cool!
Adrien:::Watch this, Plagg. 
Plagg::: What exactly are you doing?
Adrien:::Shh, I can't let her think it's the real me! 
Marinette:::I'm super cool. I'm super cool! I'm super cool... I'm super cool, I'm sup—AHH! Oh, it's only a statue. How come I didn't see it earlier? Wow... it looks so... real.The wax is nearly as hot as skin.It even smells exactly like him...!Oh, beautiful statue of Adrien, your wax is so soft! Your yak hair is silky. Your eyes are so green.Oh, shall I be a statue, too! Everything would be so much easier.Why haven't we been molded together in the plaster of destiny? Marble to marble, wax lips against wax lips, entwined for eternity... Ah... 
Adrien:::Whoa—! Eternity sounds like a long time...!
Marinette::: Dahh!
Adrien::: I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you, it was just a prank, that's all...
Marinette:::Not funny, not funny at all! 
Adrien:::Forgive me... even after all these months with you guys I guess I'm still not used to being a good friend...
Alya:::Nino! C'mon, I'm tired of hiding... where are you?Hah! 
Puppeteer:::This is so much fun!
Hawk Moth:::Puppeteer, don't forget to bring me back my little toys, Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!
Puppeteer:::I'm gonna play with you,you...And you,and you! 
Adrien::: Were you serious when you were talking to the statue? I mean... me as a statue?
Marinette::: Serious? Me?You gotta be kidding! I'm the queen of pranks!I knew you were playing a prank on me, so I just wanted to get you back! Gotcha! 
Adrien:::So you didn't really mean all the things you just said?
Marinette::: Of course not, I was role playing! I was in love with a statue, not with you!If I'd feel anything for you, it wouldn't be like for that statue, rather like, for a... regular human being! 
Adrien::: Okay... So, as I am a human being, you must still like me a bit then, right?
Marinette:::That's right, I like you a little bit, just like a regular human being!Can somebody throw me into a vat of wax right now, please? 
Adrien and Marinette::: Hawk Moth!? 
Adrien::: Marinette! Go get some help!
Puppeteer:::Oh, no! You're going to stay and play with me this time!
Marinette and Adrien::: Manon!?
Puppeteer:::Nope! I am the Puppeteer, and I wanna play with you and my statues! 
Marinette::: Be careful!
Adrien::: Don't worry about me! 
Marinette:::Tikki, spots on! 
Ladybug:::Go and find a safe place to hide, I'll handle this. 
Adrien:::Plagg, claws out! 
Cat Noir:::Whoa! You've captured Hawk Moth!
Ladybug::: I wish! 
Cat Noir::: Ohh, a wax statue.
Ladybug::: The Puppeteer is back! She must be here somewhere!
Cat Noir::: We gotta find and save her!
Ladybug::: The Hero's Room! That's where she found Hawk Moth's statue!
Cat Noir::: After you, m'lady. 
Ladybug::: Look out!It's not her, it's a statue! Look,the real Puppeteer had a wand, remember?
Cat Noir::: Then this Puppeteer must've taken it. That's where the akuma must be!Okay, who wants to play red light, green light?Nobody's up for hopscotch, either? 
Ladybug::: Enough jokes, Kitty— There's a little girl at stake! 
Cat Noir:::You know, M'lady, the worse the situation, the more I realize how amazing you are.
Ladybug::: How do you do that...? Ah! 
Cat Noir:::Do what?
Ladybug:::I mean so much to you, how is it so easy for you to say these nice things to me, even in the worse situations?The really important things are the hardest to say, aren't they?
Cat Noir:::It's precisely when something is important, that it's important to say it, no matter what.
Ladybug:::The workshop— She's gotta be there! 
Cat Noir:::Got it!Ahh, that's so gross! Ah! 
Ladybug:::That should hold them for a bit.Wait up! We don't know what we're gonna find behind this door, let's stack the odds in our favor! Lucky Charm!A cardboard tube? What am I gonna do with this?I'll figure it out. Let's go! 
Puppeteer:::Neener, neener, neeener! I've got tons of friends, but you? No one wants to play with you, Ladybug!
Ladybug::: You forget I always have my partner with me— Cat Noir!
Puppeteer::: Really? Cat Noir, capture Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Ah! What's wrong with you!?It's a statue!
Cat Noir:::Cleaning done! It deserves a little scratch under the chin before going up, right?Is that a new perfume, m'lady? This one smells like... wax? Cataclysm! 
Ladybug:::We're done playing games!Gimme that! 
Puppeteer::: Noo!You lose, Ladybug!Now you won't be able to steal my wand again, meanie!Take her miraculous! 
Cat Noir:::Hands off, you pale imitation! Hah!Only one cat is allowed to have her hand.
Ladybug:::Thanks, Kitty.
Cat Noir:::Have you found out what to do with your Lucky Charm? 
Ladybug:::I do now!
Ladybug::: Let go, you fake! 
Puppeteer:::I've almost beat you, Ladybug! Cat Noir, give me her earrings!Cat Noir, give me her earrings!
Hawk Moth:::What's happening, Puppeteer? 
Puppeteer::: I don't know, my wand stopped working!
Ladybug::: Surprise!I swapped them earlier. You lose, Puppeteer!
Puppeteer::: Heh! I don't care! If you break my wand, I'll just turn them into real wax statues! 
Ladybug::: No! Don't do that! Fine, I'll give you your wand back.
Puppeteer:::Huh? What is that? Hey!If you're the real one, then that means that—! Ah! 
Ladybug::: Too late! 
Puppeteer::: No!
Ladybug:::No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little butterfly! Miraculous Ladybug! 
Ladybug & Cat Noir:::Pound it!
Hawk Moth::: Soon, I'm the one who'll pulling the strings, Ladybug, and that day will come sooner than you think! 
Véronique::: There we are. All back together again. 
Marinette:::Hey, wait, Manon has to see this! Oh, but where is she?
Alya:::Maybe she's behind that weird statue over there! 
Manon::: Boo!Gotcha! 
Adrien:::To Manon's place, please!To Marinette's?
Adrien & Marinette::: I'm sorr—!
Marinette::: You go first.
Adrien::: No, please, you.
Marinette:::I'm sorry, I shouldn't have kissed the statue, but I didn't know it was you, and if I had, it wouldn't have been a prank because I—
Adrien::: No, no... It's my fault. When you left the workshop, I was so worried that you were mad at me...? It made me do the stupid prank, and...
Marinette::: Of course I wasn't mad at you! I'm sorry that I made you believe that.
Adrien::: Is that true? We're still friends, you and me?
Marinette::: Of course! But, to be safe, maybe we should stop playing pranks on each other.
Adrien:::I know, I'm not good with jokes. The girl I'm in love with doesn't like them either.
Marinette::: The girl that you—? You're... you're in love with...?
Adrien::: Are you okay, Marinette?
Marinette::: Yeah, yeah. I'm glad we're friends. 
Adrien::: See you tomorrow at school?
Marinette::: Yeah... 
Marinette:::You heard him. Adrien's in love with another girl, and me? I'm just a friend.
Tikki::: Oh, I'm sure life has many surprises in store for you, Marinette!
Marinette:::Yeah...That would've been one very silly first kiss, anyways.
