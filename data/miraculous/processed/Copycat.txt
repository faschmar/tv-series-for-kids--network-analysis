Tikki::: How about inviting him to a movie then?
Marinette::: Right, Tikki. Can you imagine that conversation?
Tikki::: Hey Adrien, would you like to gah— wuh,glah.
Marinette::: Exactly. I can't help it. Every time I see him,I get all clammy and I feel like fainting.
Tikki::: So... basically the only way you could have a normal conversation with him, is if you're blindfolded.
Marinette::: Pretty much.
Tikki::: There is a very simple solution, Marinette, it's called a cell phone. You just need his number.
Marinette::: I know who'll have Adrien's number!
André::: I'm sure you've outdone yourself, Théo.
Théo::: It was my honor. And I can't wait to meet Ladybug, I hope she'll autograph the photo I used as the inspiration for the statue.
André::: Oh, it's nearly time. Ladybug and Cat Noir should already be here by now.
Alya::: Look, we all know improv's not your bag,so just stick to this script.
Marinette::: But all the teachers say I don't sound natural when I read.
Alya::: Then memorize it. It's pretty simple. You can do this. Just don't improvise. Got it?
Marinette:::Forget it! This is never gonna work!
Alya:::Too late. It's dialing. 
Adrien's voice recorder::: Hey, this is Adrien's voicemail. Leave a message.
Marinette::: It's gone to voicemail!
Alya::: Leave a message! Don't improv!
Marinette::: Uhh, hello. Uh, Adrien's voicemail, uh, this is Marinette, who, uh, has a message for you, of course, cause it's, uh, your phone, so, umm...Callmeseeyoulater,bye! 
Marinette:::What? What did you expect me to say? Hey, hot stuff, this is Marinette, I'd ask you on a date to a movie, but I've got such a crazy crush on you that the only way I can talk to you without foaming out the mouth is over this stupid phone. Pretty ridiculous, right?
Automated voice:::If you wish to hear your message again, press 1. If you wish to erase your message, press 2.
Marinette::: 
Alya::: Hit 2! Hit 2!
Automated voice:::Message saved. Goodbye.
Alya::: It's not as bad as you think.
Marinette::: Hmm?
Alya::: Okay, it's bad. But you were gonna have to tell him one of these days, some way or another. Think of it this way: no more secrets!
Marinette::: The voicemail recorded my whole conversation.
Alya::: Big deal!
Marinette::: I called him hot stuff. He cannot be allowed to hear that message, Alya! If he does, I'll die of shame!
Alya::: Okay, okay. I got an idea. If Adrien's phone went to voicemail, it means the dude's busy. Which also means you can get to it before he does. Hmm, I wonder where he'd be...
Marinette::: Of course! He's got fencing club after school, that's why he didn't pick up! It ends in exactly twenty-two and a half minutes.
Alya::: You are seriously insane. You know that, right?
Plagg:::Ahhhhh!
Automated voice:::You have 1 new message. 
Adrien::: Gotta get a drink of water. I'll be right back.Plagg, you pig!
Plagg::: You have 1 new message. 
Adrien::: Move, please, so I can check my voicemail. Hmm, don't recognize this number. Oh no, now we're late! Time to transform, Plagg! 
Cat Noir:::Woo-hoo! Yeah-ha-ha! Ha! Hahaha!Hey, everybody!
Alya::: They're unveiling Ladybug and Cat Noir's sculptures today! I totally spaced!
Marinette::: Me too.
Alya::: Uh, you never mentioned going to the unveiling before.
Marinette::: I'm not, I mean, I am! Uh, I mean, I forgot?
Alya::: Listen. About Adrien's cellphone, what if we go right after?
Marinette::: If we wait after the ceremony, Adrien's fencing training will be over, and he'll have his phone back by then.
Alya::: Shoot. I gotta cover this event for the Ladyblog... I'm sorry, Marinette!
Marinette::: Don't sweat it. I can manage. I think!
Alya::: You sure?
Marinette::: Yes, yes. I'm sure.
Alya::: Cool. Good luck, and stay out of trouble. And don't improv!
Tikki::: Isn't Ladybug supposed to be at the unveiling?
Marinette::: Yes, but Marinette needs to be at the school first.
Tikki::: But it is a ceremony in your honor.
Marinette::: And it's my honor that's at stake right now. I'll be in and out of there in five minutes. We can be at the ceremony in no time!
Théo::: Excuse me, Cat Noir, but Ladybug's not here.
Cat Noir::: Don't worry about Ladybug. I'm sure she'll be here any minute. I can handle this situation alone for now. I'm the one in charge anyway, you know.
Théo::: It's just that, I wanted to ask her to autograph this photo. She's amazing. She's so brave and smart, the way she always saves everyone...
André::: Perhaps the ceremony should commence. It might bring her here faster.
Théo::: Please, just one minute more, Mayor Bourgeois, she's going to come, I can feel it...
Marinette::: ...I'm there! 
Tikki::: Oh Boy.
Marinette::: Which one's his?
Tikki::: If you call him, you'll make his phone ring.
Marinette::: Nice, Tikki! 
Mayor Bourgeois::: It's only proper for Paris to pay homage to those to protect us from evil.Ladybug and Cat Noir!
Alya::: Can I get some photos for the Ladyblog?
Tikki::: Hurry, they're finishing up!
Marinette::: Here it is!Gah! It's locked!
Tikki:::Ta-dah!
Cat Noir::: These statues are amazing. One thing's slightly off though— I'm actually taller than Ladybug.
Théo::: Ladybug didn't show up. I just wanted to express my adoration for her. Let her know that everything I had went into her statue. I'm sure if she took a little time to get to know me, she would see how much we have in common. Our devotion to the things we love.
Cat Noir::: Hey, don't mean to burst your bubble, but you know, Ladybug and me, we're a thing, you know?
Théo::: Really?
Cat Noir::: Yeah, we're like this. 
Théo:::What does Ladybug see in him?
Tikki::: They're coming! Put back the phone!
Marinette::: I haven't erased the message yet!
Tikki::: We're out of time and we really ought to be getting to that ceremony, come on!
Student::: Whew! That was rough. Ha ha.
Théo::: A thing, huh? You don't even take love seriously. Calling it a thing... You don't deserve her! I do!
Hawk Moth::: Disappointed by Ladybug and jealous of Cat Noir. The perfect formula for disaster.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!
Hawk Moth::: Hello, Copycat. I am Hawk Moth. Once you get rid of Cat Noir, you can take his place. And Ladybug will be yours forever.
Théo::: The very thought of it makes me purr. 
Adrien::: Ugh, where is it? 
Plagg::: What are you looking at me for? I didn't eat it. I swear!
Marinette::: How do you listen to messages on this—Home?It's Adrien! He's looking for his phone! What if he tracks it?He'll figure out I stole it, I'll be arrested for grand theft, I'll spend the rest of my life in jail, and worse, I'll never get to go to the movies with Adrien! 
Tikki::: Oh, Marinette. You really need to get your priorities in order.
Marinette::: I know. Some days it feels impossible to balance being Marinette and being Ladybug.
Adrien's Voicemail::: Hey, this is Adrien's voicemail. Leave a message.
Adrien::: Ugh, it must still be at the gym. 
Copycat::: 
Copycat:::Don't mind me. Just stealing this painting. Go about your business.
Civilian 1::: Hey! 
Civilian 2::: I gotta get this on camera!
Nadja:::And in some astonishing news, there's been a spectacular theft at the Louvre. Amateur video showed without a shadow of a doubt that the thief is none other than the famous hero, Cat Noir.
Copycat:::This painting is the cat's meow. 
Adrien:::Cat's meow?Not only is that person a fake, he's a terrible fake!
Nadja:::Thanks, now for your weather.
Tikki::: Maybe it would help if you took off those silly mittens.
Marinette::: And risk leaving fingerprints? No way. 
Alya::: Problem fixed?
Marinette::: Almost. I haven't erased the message yet, but I'm working on it as we speak.
Alya::: No way. You palmed his phone?
Marinette::: Yes? No? Uhh... I mean, I was planning to give it back. Actually, where are you? I can use some help.
Alya::: No can do. I'm waiting for additional deets at the Louvre on the Cat Noir robbery.
Marinette::: What? Somebody robbed Cat Noir?
Alya::: No, girl. Didn't you hear? Cat Noir came in and stole the Mona Lisa! In broad daylight! Ladybug's gonna turn up for sure, and I do not wanna miss this. Just chill and I'll be over later.
Marinette::: 'Kay.Cat Noir is a lot of things, but he's no thief.Time to transform!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Cat Noir::: Whoa! Easy, tigers! You've got the wrong cat! That thief's an impostor. I'm the real Cat Noir!
Cat Noir::: Let me check out where the robbery took place. I have a knack for finding clues. You know, animal instincts.
Roger::: Of course. Come with me. Thanks for your help, Cat Noir.
Cat Noir::: Hey! I'm the real Cat Noir! I'm way slicker than that guy.
Roger:::Kitty's in the slammer. I repeat, kitty's in the slammer.
Ladybug::: Mr. Mayor, this is ridiculous. I'm sure there's a simple explanation.
Roger::: Kitty's in the slammer, Ladybug.
Ladybug::: Don't think you're gonna keep him in there—
Roger::: Now, now. Leave it to the experts, Ladybug. We've got it under control.
Ladybug::: Hmph!
Cat Noir::: Thanks for the warm hospitality, but I gotta split, so... I'll just say this one more time. You've got the wrong cat! 
Officer:::Cat Noir is getting away!
Roger::: Well, if he's so innocent, then why is he running away?
Ladybug::: Well, if you were wrongly imprisoned, wouldn't you run?
Roger::: Requesting assistance, I repeat, requesting assistance. We are in pursuit of the suspect...
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, what's going on?
Cat Noir::: You know I'm innocent, don't you, Bugaboo?
Ladybug::: Stop playing around and calling me Bugaboo. This is really serious!
Cat Noir::: I'm gonna find the real culprit and save my tail. I'll get back to—
Cat Noir::: Wha!
Ladybug::: Huh?
Police:::Give yourself up, Cat Noir!
Roger::: Aren't you gonna go after him?
Ladybug::: Uhh, I'll leave it to the experts. 
Police::: Come on, let's get him!
Plagg::: If you want my opinion, I'd say the thief was akumatized. 
Adrien::: That much I had figured. See that lollipop stick? The sculptor. How did I not see that jealousy coming a mile away?
Plagg::: Yours or his?
Adrien::: Ha ha, so funny.
Cat Noir::: Gotcha, Copycat.
Ladybug::: Huh? Cat Noir, where are you?
Cat Noir::: I found his den.
Ladybug::: Who?
Cat Noir::: My Copycat.
Ladybug::: I'm not getting you.
Cat Noir::: If you'd been there this morning, you'd know what I was talking about.
Ladybug::: Well? Tell me where you are.
Cat Noir::: No, this is between me and him. I got myself into this mess, so I'm gonna get myself out.
Ladybug::: Uhh, Cat? Cat! 
Cat Noir:::Cat's in the bag?
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm!
Copycat::: I don't get what Ladybug sees in you. A fool who so easily falls into my trap.
Copycat::: Looking for this? Which one should I pick up? My one or my one?
Copycat::: Ladybug, hurry up. I've caught the impostor at Théo Barbot's workshop.
Ladybug::: I'll be there in thirty seconds.
Cat Noir::: Don't come here, Ladybug! It's a trap! 
Copycat::: Too late, Cat. Ladybug's on her way, which was my plan all along.
Cat Noir::: She won't be duped. She knows me too well.
Copycat::: I know you well too.And from now on, she'll love me, not you!
Cat Noir::: Love me? ...You're right! She loves me! That's why she'll be able to reveal your true identity!
Hawk Moth::: Copycat, stop this small talk and get me Cat Noir's Miraculous!
Copycat::: Huh?
Cat Noir::: Ha ha!
Copycat::: There you are.
Ladybug::: Cat Noir! He really looks like you!
Cat Noir::: That's because I am me!
Ladybug::: Where is his akuma?
Copycat::: Inside his ring, of course. Grab it.
Hawk Moth::: Ladybug's doing all the work for us. What sweet irony.
Ladybug::: He even has the same powers as you.
Copycat::: Simply amazing, isn't it?
Cat Noir::: If you don't believe I'm the real Cat Noir, ask him about our love for each other.
Ladybug::: Uhh...
Cat Noir::: Have I ever lied to you, Bugaboo?
Ladybug:::I hope you didn't tell him about us.
Copycat::: What..?
Ladybug::: That we're... you know, we made a secret promise? Hmm?
Copycat::: Uh, yes! Of course!
Ladybug::: We never made a promise. Copycat!
Copycat:::I love you, Ladybug! I'm way better than this mangy alley cat!
Ladybug::: Sorry, but liars are losers. Cat Noir may annoy me to pieces, but he's never lied to me.
Cat Noir::: Thanks for the compliment. I think.
Hawk Moth:::Do it now, take his Miraculous!
Copycat::: If I can't have you, then nobody will! Cataclysm!
Ladybug::: Let's wrap this up! spoon appears.) A spoon? What am I supposed to do with this?
Cat Noir::: Excellent job, my lady.
Ladybug::: Where's his akuma?
Cat Noir::: The photo in his pocket. Let's make it snappy.
Copycat::: Ha ha ha! You're going to change back before me.
Ladybug::: He's pretty good.
Cat Noir::: Don't need to rub it in!
Copycat::: I told you I was better than him.
Ladybug:::But I'm better than both of you! 
Cat Noir::: Hey, it's me!
Copycat::: He's lying! I'm the real one!
Ladybug::: Ugh, now you're both annoying me to pieces! Show me your ring. How many pads do you have left?
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, scratch attack!
Cat Noir::: Gladly. I love a good cat fight. 
Ladybug::: Time to go akuma fishing!
Ladybug::: No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! 
Ladybug::: Nice catch!
Cat Noir::: I'm so glad you could tell the real cat from the fake one.
Ladybug::: Once I figured out which cat was really in love with me, it was a no-brainer.
Cat Noir::: Better help the fellow out. His crush just got crushed.That makes two of us.
Théo::: Ugh... What am I doing here? Ladybug?
Ladybug::: I'm sorry I couldn't make it this morning, Théo.
Théo::: Can you autograph it for me?
Ladybug::: Of course I can! You've got some real artistry here. You've really captured my essence.
Théo::: Thank you, Ladybug. And don't worry. I know about you and Cat Noir. It's okay.
Ladybug::: Huh?
Adrien::: Didn't find it.
Automated voice:::If you wish to hear your message again, press 1. If you wish to erase your message, press 2.
Automated voice::: Your message has been erased.
Marinette::: You know what? I'm gonna tell him I found his phone. That'd be a good way to start up a conversation, wouldn't it? And I'll invite him to the movies.
Alya::: That's my girl.
Nino::: Maybe you dropped it somewhere.
Adrien::: Well, if I did, then, whoever has it found it in the Boys' locker room. I was checking my voicemail in there during fencing practice.
Alya::: Do it now!
Adrien::: Huh? What in the... I already looked in here a thousand times!
Nino::: You need some time off. Hey, I know, let's go to the movies tonight.
Alya::: Hey, dudes, mind if a few friends tag along?
Nino::: Sure thing!
Marinette::: Yay!
