Nadja:::Nadja Chamack, live above Paris. Escaped animals are invading the city! But Ladybug, Cat Noir and their new friend, Rena Rouge, are already on the spot.
Civilian::: I'm sure they'll get the animals back in the zoo super fast.
Kim::: Right, sir. They are the best!I wish I could be a superhero. The powers. The secrets. The costume. That would be awesome, right?
Ondine:::Yeah, sure.
Kim::: How can I become one? You think there's some kind of superhero school, or something? Or maybe more like some super secret training facility?
Ondine::: You wanna know my secret?
Kim::: Yeah, totally! I love this game.I have a serious crush on this Boy, but he has no idea.That boy's clueless.Okay, now it's my turn.
Ondine:::I can stick my big toe inside my ear...?
Ondine:::Let's stop beating about the bush. 
Kim::: Ah! The movie! I totally forgot! 
Ondine::: But we haven't finished yet!
Kim::: I've really gotta split. I asked Chloé to come, remember? The girl I told you about in my class? Next time, I promise!
Ondine:::The Boy I'm crushing on is...you.
Hawk Moth::: Poor Little Mermaid. How many times have you tried to tell your Prince how you feel? And how many times has he dismissed you?Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her!
Cat Noir::: Come on, guys, you wouldn't eat one of your cousins, would ya?
Rena Rouge:::Mirage! 
Cat Noir::: How about some tasty chops, instead? 
Cat Noir:::Pound i—Hey, where're you going?
Ladybug::: Rena's about to transform back.
Cat Noir::: So you're allowed to know her true identity, but I'm not?
Ladybug::: Because I have to get her Miraculous back.
Cat Noir::: So what's my role, then? The guy who's always left in the dark? What else are you hiding from me?
Rena Rouge:::We really gotta jam.
Ladybug:::Okay, I'll talk to him about it.
Cat Noir::: Him? Who's him?
Ladybug::: Uh...when the time is right, Cat Noir, I promise. 
Cat Noir:::I hate secrets.
Alya::: We can do this again whenever you want, Lady—Oh! The movie!Later!
Ladybug::: Spots off. 
Tikki::: Uh, if you want to get to that movie on time too, you better go the way Alya went.
Marinette::: Sorry, Tikki; we'll just have to miss the trailers again.
Hawk Moth::: Syren, I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you the power to turn Paris into your own underwater kingdom, for you and your prince. In return, you must bring me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.
Ondine::: May they all sink under my sorrow.
Max:::You're 3 minutes and 37 seconds late; everybody's already inside.
Kim::: Is Chloé here?
Max:::Chloé watching Mecha Monkey vs. Cyber Shark 3? I think your swimming cap's on too tight, Kim.
Alya:::Ah, let me guess —Marinette hasn't arrived yet?
Max::: True to form. We'll save you both a seat. 
Alya:::Marinette, Marinette, Marinette.
Master Fu::: Perfect. Now come and tell me what's bothering you, Marinette.
Marinette::: Huh? How do you...?
Master Fu:::Hold on. You both stay here.
Wayzz and Tikki::: Oh, Master, please!
Master Fu::: Kwamis must never know the recipe that can modify their powers. Ever!
Marinette::: Modify their powers?
Master Fu::: Imagine what would happen if one of you were captured by a villain, just like Hawk Moth's kwami, Nooroo.
Wayzz and Tikki:::Ohh! 
Master Fu::: So, what's on your mind, Marinette?
Marinette::: Master Fu, Cat Noir is asking more and more questions. He's tired of being left in the dark.
Master Fu::: Tell me, Marinette; do you put the noodles in the water before the water boils?
Marinette::: Uh, no.
Master Fu::: Exactly. That's because there's a right time for everything. 
Marinette::: Uh, what are you cooking exactly?
Master Fu::: When fed with a specific blend of ingredients, the kwamis can grant special power. Each power's specific mix is listed here, encoded in the Grimoire. I've deciphered most of the ingredients; for example, to trigger aquatic powers you need a branch from the dragon king's garden — that's seaweed; then secret kept in a shell — that's an oyster pearl. But the last one still puzzles me: a tear of joy. I can't figure it out, and it's required for almost every blend. Oh! Maybe it could be some dancing ant honeydew.I think I may have finally got the right mix.
Adrien:::Hey, Cat Noir, do you trust me?Sure, Ladybug; do you trust me, too?Are you kidding? I will never trust you! Ha ha ha ha!You must know what Ladybug's hiding from me, Plagg.
Plagg::: I'm just a kwami, Adrien, and we kwamis have a right to remain silent.
Adrien::: Pity.Just when I was about to order you some very tasty cheese. Have you ever sampled La Trappe d'Échourgnac? It says here it tastes like walnuts.
Plagg:::I can't be swayed, sorry!
Adrien::: Did you know about the Fourme de Montbrison? Apparently, it's the oldest cheese in the world.
Plagg:::You don't say...!
Adrien::: Yes... and do you know why its rind is orange? Because they age it on special boards of spruce wood.
Plagg:::There's only one thing in this world that smells as good as cheese!
Adrien::: Which one do you prefer, the Tomme de Bouche, or the Saintignon? 
Wayzz::: Mmmm, there's a slight flavor to it. Yes, I remember it being a lot like this.
Master Fu::: Ha! I knew it.
Wayzz::: A little more salt, maybe?
Master Fu::: Oh, failed again.
Marinette::: Hey Alya...yeah, what's up? The movie? Oh, uh, of course I didn't forget. I'm almost there.Sorry, Master. Good luck finding the secret ingredient.
Marinette:::Coming! Sorry, I was—
Alya::: No time to explain. Come on!
Rose:::Hi!
Nino::: Hey!
Marinette:::Sorry...sorry...sorry.
Marinette::: What's going on?
Alya::: Okay, who left the faucet running?
Marinette::: The stairs! Quick!
Fleeing girl::: Hurry up!
Marinette:::Everyone, up on the roof!
Plagg::: 
Adrien::: Tome de Quraish with truffles; raw milk Camembert, aged on vine leaves marinated in Emmental juice.
Plagg::: Looks like your whole cheese strategy will have to tread water.
Adrien:::Don't worry, this isn't over.
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Markov:::My circuits are sensitive to water.
Kim::: Wha, ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha!Come on, guys! I can teach you to swim in two seconds flat, Markov. You just put your arms like this, then you push your legs, and it's kind of like being a frog, you see. In fact, it helps to think as a frog, too, you know—
Max:::Kim!!
Alya:::Where is he? Can you see him?Marinette, what are you doing?!
Marinette::: Um, I'm gonna go get help!I'm fine!
Alix:::Okay so...I guess we're saved, then?
Syren::: Kim! I found you at last. 
Marinette::: Okay, we're alone.
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Kim::: Huh! This is amazing! I can breathe underwater, just like a fish.
Syren::: I knew you'd love it, and I've got lots of other surprises for you, you'll see—
Kim::: Hey!
Syren::: My prince!
Hawk Moth:::With every new environment comes a new set of rules, Ladybug, you won't be able to win this time. Ladybugs can't breathe underwater. Syren, are you going to let Ladybug steal your prince away from you?
Syren::: Never!
Cat Noir::: Ladybug?You didn't tell me you were going swimming today.
Ladybug::: I wasn't planning on it; ladybugs aren't exactly cut out for deep-sea diving, you know.
Cat Noir::: Cats aren't exactly crazy about water either, you know. Is there any chance you can get us a submarine? 
Ladybug:::Pawssibly, kitty cat. potion bowl appears)
Cat Noir::: Huh. Well, we can always use it to scoop up the water. It'll just take a long time.
Ladybug:::I'll be right back! 
Cat Noir::: Wait! Where're you going?
Ladybug:::I can't.
Cat Noir:::Say anything. Yeah, I know. But we are a team, aren't we?I'm tired of all these secrets.
Ladybug::: I'm sorry. It's not exactly easy for me either, trust me. 
Ladybug:::Spots off! 
Marinette::: Master Fu? Master?
Master Fu::: This way.
Marinette::: Cat Noir and I can't defeat the mermaid underwater.
Master Fu:::I know, and unfortunately I haven't found the correct blend that could help you both out.I've failed you.
Marinette::: No way! We are gonna find that last ingredient! 
Master Fu::: The Tear of Joy? I've tried everything: water from the Laughing Fountain, melted snow from the Mountain of Jubilation, drops of pure chocolate extract!
Marinette::: But have you tried a real tear of joy?
Master Fu::: What?!
Marinette::: Come on, tell me a really, really funny joke!
Master Fu::: Do you think this is really the time to have fun?
Marinette::: Okay, why do you go to bed at night?
Master Fu:::I don't know, uh...
Marinette::: Because the bed won't come to you!What goes up, but doesn't move? Stairs!What does a snail say when it's riding on a turtle's back?Wooohooo!!
Master Fu::: I think you have just found the magic ingredient, Marinette!
Tikki::: Mmm! Yummy!
Marinette::: Tikki, power up! 
Tikki::: Aqua-Tikki! 
Marinette::: Aqua-Tikki, spots on! Yeah!
Aquabug::: Master Fu, I think it's time you put those noodles into the boiling water.
Master Fu::: You're right, Ladybug. I'll take care of it.
Cat Noir::: This is so dumb!Claws in. 
Plagg:::What's taking her so long?Whoa, easy! W-What are you doing?!
Adrien:::If you don't tell me what Ladybug is hiding from me, I'm done!
Plagg::: You can't do that!
Adrien:::Why not? No one'll know if I quit. No one'll care!
Plagg::: I will!
Adrien::: Why?Because you won't have anyone to give you Camembert?
Plagg::: Oh, I'm sure there'll be another Cat Noir to give me cheese......but he won't be you. 
Master Fu:::Hello, Cat Noir. 
Nathalie::: Adrien, please reconsider! You know what your father wants!
Adrien::: This is what I wanna do!
Master Fu::: Thank you, young man.
Adrien:::You! You're the man who—
Master Fu:::I'll explain everything, I promise. But right now, you must go and help Ladybug! 
Plagg:::Oh, no! I hate transforming.
Kim:::I love what you've done with the pool! It's awesome!
Syren::: This is the pool where the old me tried to pour her heart out to you so many times.
Kim::: But, uh...I've never seen a Syren at the pool.Ondine?! 
Syren::: I'm your Syren now. And you could be my merman.It only needs a kiss, and you'll become just like me!
Kim::: You mean I could swim as fast as you?
Syren:::Yes, Kim! You'll be my Prince, and we'll rule this underwater city together, forever! 
Kim:::Wait! Does this mean I never get to see Mecha Monkeys vs. Cyber Sharks 3?
Syren:::What?!
Aquabug:::Oh, yes you will; don't worry! In fact, you'll probably make it to the next showing! 
Aqua Noir:::The three of us can go together.I'll even share my popcorn.
Hawk Moth:::I knew those Miraculous had hidden powers! Syren! There's too many fish in this sea. Take their Miraculous before they take your merman away in their net!
Kim::: Your new outfits are so cool!
Aqua Ladybug::: Oh, um, thanks! But tell me, what happened to your friend that got her so worked up?
Kim::: We were playing a game of secrets, and I think she was trying to tell me that I'm the Boy she likes. But, I was a doofus and didn't realize.
Aquabug::: Game of secrets? What kind?
Kim::: It's a game Ondine invented.You write down a secret and put it inside the bracelet's capsule. It's awesome! You wanna know my secret?
Aquabug:::That's where the akuma must be! Aqua Lucky Charm!Car keys? I guess we should hit the road, then.Here. You can breathe through this.
Syren:::Kim! 
Aqua Noir::: Hey! We're not done yet! 
Syren:::Ladybug! What have you done to my prince?!
Aquabug:::I think he took someone else to the ball.
Syren::: I won't let you steal him from me! Kim is mine! 
Aquabug:::Cat Noir! Are you all right?
Aqua Noir:::Yeah, Bugaboo. Like a fish in water.
Aquabug::: Great! Now, be ready to strike!Cat Noir! Now!
Aqua Noir::: Looks like I got a nibble!How cool! I always wanted a goldfish! 
Aquabug::: No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly.Miraculous Ladybug!
Aqua Noir::: Thank you for keeping your promise, M'Lady.
Aquabug:::We are a team, aren't we?
Aquabug & Aqua Noir:::Pound it!
Master Fu::: Each blend corresponds to a new power.
Marinette:::Oh wow! That's a lot of powers!
Master Fu:::You should keep these vials with you at all times, just in case.
Marinette:::Well...that's not very practical.
Master Fu::: Only the ingredients matter. They could be contained in anything.
Marinette::: Then...I may just have an idea!
Tom::: My little girl's mini-'macaroons' are ready. Mmm! They look so good! 
Marinette:::Uh, actually, I'll taste them first and see if they are good.
Tom::: My daughter baked them! They're bound to be great!
Tikki::: Mmm! Magical 'macaroons'! I love your idea, Marinette!
Marinette:::One 'magic-aroon', one transformation.
Tikki::: The blue one looks yummy!
Marinette::: You'll see.I'm told it's icy. 
Kim::: Wanna play a game of secrets? 
Ondine:::Wanna go to the movies with me?
Gabriel:::Who is it?!
Master Fu:::Over here!Lower.Hello, I'm Mr. Chan. Adrien's Chinese tutor could not come today. I'll be replacing him.
Gabriel:::Hmmm.
Translator app::: What time is it? Xiànzài jí diǎn le? 现在几点了?
Adrien::: Xiànzài jí diǎn le?
Master Fu::: Shí jiān dào le. 时间到了 It's the right time.
Nathalie::: Adrien, here's Mr. Chan. He'll be your substitute teacher for today. 
Master Fu::: Hello, Adrien. I think you and I should have a little talk.
Plagg::: Adrien, meet Master Fu, the last Guardian of the Miraculous. 
Gabriel:::Nooroo! How can I obtain more powers?
Nooroo::: What do you mean, Master?
Gabriel::: Don't treat me like an idiot! Ladybug and Cat Noir have new powers. How did they do it?
Nooroo::: We kwamis do not know the recipes.
Gabriel::: It's inside this Grimoire, isn't it? Can't you read it?
Nooroo::: Only Guardians can. I don't know anything, I swear!
Gabriel::: Well then, I will have to find this Guardian of the Miraculous, wherever he is.
Plagg:::Oh, no! I hate transforming.
