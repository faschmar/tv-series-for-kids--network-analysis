Marinette::: Phew! That was a close save.
Tikki::: What you did for Alya today was very cool, Marinette!
Marinette::: You think? I would've liked to do more, but...
Sabine:::Marinette! Alya's here!
Alya:::Don't worry, Ms. Dupain-Cheng, I'll just head up.
Marinette::: You didn't exactly wait very long to tell me the big news. Hide Tikki, quick!
Alya::: Girl, you will not believe what just happened to me! So Ladybug had just saved a bunch of workers from a supervillain! There were like a gazillion reporters waiting to interview her and... that's when it happened!
Ladybug:::Hey! Aren't you Alya, the girl who writes the blog about me? The...Ladyblog!
Alya:::Uh... yeah!
Ladybug:::I like your work. It's awesome. Keep it up! 
Alya:::Your earring, Ladybug!
Ladybug:::Ah! Thanks. Better get going. Bug out!
Marinette::: Uh... that was super...
Alya::: Cool, right? Ladybug knows me! My blog! She thinks it's awesome! Awesome! Awesomeee!
Marinette::: Yeah, that's... awesome!
Alya::: Lemme go grab your laptop!
Marinette::: You're right, Tikki, I think it made her a little happy.
Tikki::: Can I see the video?
Marinette::: Okay, but fast.Whoa! You thought I was gonna drop it, didn't you? 
Tikki::: Video deleted?
Marinette:::I didn't just do that! Tell me I didn't just do that!
Tikki::: You didn't just do that.
Marinette::: Ahhh!
Tikki::: Okay, you did just do that, but the least you didn't drop it!
Marinette::: Oh, I really screwed up this time! Alya's gonna kill me!
Tikki::: It's not the end of the world. I'm sure Alya will understand, uh, she is your best friend!
Marinette::: You're right.
Marinette::: Uh, on second thought...
Alya::: Who are you talking to?
Marinette::: Uh, to a...a pigeon! Say hello to Alya, Jacques!
Alya::: Say Bye bye, Jacques. And come down! You've got visitors!
Sabine::: What did you say the name of the play is, Mr. Haprèle?
Fred::: Well, it's...
Mylène::: It's called The Mime's Extraordinary Adventures, starring the most talented, amazingly awesome actor and mime!
Fred::: Come on, now.
Mylène::: My father! Give it up for Fred Haprèle!
Fred::: Thank you very much! Thank you, Mylène.
Sabine::: Well, congratulations, you must make your daughter very proud!
Fred::: Now all I need is my hat to complete my costume.
Marinette:::Here it is!
Fred::: Thank you, Marinette! Saving me at the last minute.
Sabine::: Ha! I don't think Mylène was exaggerating at all!
Fred::: Why, thank you!
Marinette::: I fixed the tear in it. I also sewed the pocket on the inside, just like you asked.
Fred::: You've done a perfect job. Thanks to you, I'll have my good luck charm right here next to me at all times. A photo of my beloved daughter.
Mylène::: Aw, dad...
Fred::: Hello, Sa...
Sarah:::Fred, where are you?
Fred::: Yes, I had to pick up my hat!
Sarah::: I need you here now!
Fred::: It's not an excuse! I know the bus is leaving in less than a half hour, I'll be there!That was Sarah, the place director. She's very nervous about the premiere. She's ready to blow a fuse! So I better get going. See you tonight at the Eiffel Tower, girls!
Alya::: We can't wait!
Mylène::: Love you, Dad!
Chris::: So, what's his excuse this time?
Sarah::: He had to pick up his hat from a repair shop. At least that's what he said.
Chris::: Well, he's a very convincing actor.
Sarah::: Actually, he is a great actor. But he's always making excuses for why he's late, why he's...
Chris::: Falls asleep in the middle of rehearsal? Why he has to leave early? Why he's missing parts of his costume? Come on, Sarah! When are you gonna wake up and smell the coffee? But it's up to you if you wanna make the show suffer.
Sarah::: Look, you're his understudy. Just be ready to take his place in case something happens, okay?
Chris::: I won't let you down, Sarah.
Sarah::: Thanks.
Mylène::: Thanks, Marinette. I gotta go. I wanna swing by my house to change before the show.
Alya::: Hey, that's my ringtone!Gimme!That was my mom. I'll call her back later. Hey, Mylène! You wanna see the most amazerrific video?
Marinette::: No! Uh... I mean... You wouldn't wanted to be late for her dad's premiere, would you?
Mylène::: Yeah, Marinette's right. I gotta get going.
Alya::: Okay. I'll walk out with you and show it to you on the way.
Marinette::: Wait!Your bag's still open.All good! See you tonight!
Alya::: Bye!
Mylène::: Bye.
Fred::: Don't worry Sarah. I'm early. I'm just around the corner.
Chris::: No, this is Chris. Sarah asked me to call you with a last-minute location change. The bus is picking us up in 10 minutes, in front of the Louvre Pyramid.
Fred::: Really? That's on the other side of town!
Chris::: Yes, but, uh... It's closer to the Eiffel Tower.
Fred::: Well, okay. Uh, luckily, I'll just make it on time. Thanks for letting me know, friend.
Chris::: Sure, will see you there!
Alya::: I'm off this way.
Mylène::: All right, see you later.
Alya::: Wait! I have to show you my awesome vid... Where'd my phone go?
Tikki::: You stole Alya's phone?
Marinette::: Um, I... borrowed it! Look. All I need to do is transform into Ladybug and film myself during the exact same thing in the exact same place. And then I'll give it right back.
Tikki::: I don't know. Maybe it's just better to come clean now. You might be digging yourself a bigger hole.
Marinette::: I can handle this.
Tikki::: Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you.
Marinette::: Hey there, Mylène!
Mylène:::Do you have Alya's cellphone?
Marinette::: Uh, Alya's phone? Ah! There it is! It must have fallen down off her bag! Silly girl.
Alya:::Me! I'm here too.
Marinette::: Oh! Hi, Alya. You're on speakerphone? Hmm.. 'kay, I'll give it to you later on...at the show. See ya!
Marinette::: Don't look at me like that. This is all gonna work out! I think...
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Chris::: We have to get to the Eiffel Tower for dress rehearsal. If you wait any longer, you'll be jeopardizing the entire production.
Sarah:::You're right, Chris. Let's get going. You'll be taking Fred's place tonight.
Chris::: I definitely won't let you down.
Fred::: Where are they?Excuse me, you haven't seen a bus with the poster for The Mime's Extraordinary Adventures on it, have you? 
Chris::: He's got some nerve. Calling now? I wouldn't give him the time of day if I were you.
Fred:::Sarah, where are you?
Sarah::: We waited for you, but you never came.
Fred::: But I'm on time! In front of the pyramid.
Sarah::: What are you talking about? Why would we be meeting there?
Fred::: I don't know! I...I thought the meeting place had changed!
Sarah::: Fred, I don't want to hear any of your lame excuses.
Fred::: But, Chris said...
Sarah::: I don't care. It's not just this excuse, it's...every excuse. It's always an excuse. Well, enough is enough. Chris will be the lead tonight at the premiere. At least I can count on him.
Hawk Moth:::Hmm. An actor who misses his own premiere. Now that's a tragedy.Go, my evil akuma, let's hand this actor the role of a lifetime!
Ladybug::: Okie dokie, here we go... Hey, aren't you Alya, the girl who writes the blog about me? The... LadyblHey! No, get away!Ugh...that is so... Eww!Cats are nothing but trouble.
Fred::: What did I do? You're going to be so disappointed at me, Mylène...
Hawk Moth::: Mime, I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you the power to make whatever you gesture come to life. Destroy this premiere performance! You may be a mime, but they can't silence you! However, in return, you must bring me back Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses. So, shall we get on with the show?
Ladybug::: Are you okay?It looks like Mylène's dad's hat. Oh no! Mr. Haprèle? If there's something ticking you off, we can talk about it, you know?
Ladybug::: Or maybe not. 
Nathalie::: Yes, sir. Understood, sir. I'm, sure he'll understand, sir.
Adrien::: My dad's flaking, isn't he? Let me guess. Something came up?
Nathalie::: Yes, but he has reserved the best seats in the house for you, Adrien. Front row.
Adrien::: As usual. The best money can buy.
Ladybug::: Get out of the car and find a place to hide, I'll cover you.
Adrien::: We gotta transform now, Plagg.
Plagg::: I thought I was gonna be a spectator, not a performer. What about the show?
Adrien::: No time.
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Hawk Moth::: Grab her Miraculous, the earrings! Now!
Cat Noir::: Keep those hands to yourself, clown! It's okay, I've got this.
Ladybug::: My pleasure, Cat Noir...
Ladybug::: Apparently, not seeing is believing.
Cat Noir::: We can't let him go like that!
Ladybug::: No, wait, don't!
Cat Noir::: There, I did it.
Cat Noir::: Hey! Wait!
Cat Noir::: Nice ride, but if I were you, I would have at least made it a convertible.
Ladybug::: He's one of the actors from the theater troupe, and he's after that bus!Where is he going? We gotta stop this thing!
Cat Noir::: Slam down on the brake!
Ladybug::: What brake? 
Cat Noir::: Not bad, for driving an invisible car, Course, they'll never believe us if we tell them we just saved their lives.
Ladybug::: He's already off again! We gotta catch up with the bus before he does!What do you think you're doing?
Cat Noir::: Good thing you have friends in high places. Hold on! 
Ladybug::: I could have done this on my own.
Cat Noir:::' But we're the cat-and-bug team, remember?
Ladybug::: Bug-and-cat team, you mean. Now drop me off over there.
Cat Noir::: Keep grip.Where could the akuma be?
Ladybug::: Inside his hat!
Cat Noir::: How'd you know that?
Ladybug::: I have hidden talents. Trust me on this one.
Ladybug::: You better distract him.
Cat Noir::: Gotcha. 
Chris::: Fred?
Hawk Moth::: The Miraculous! Grab her earring!
Ladybug::: His hat! Grab his hat!
Cat Noir::: Look out!
Ladybug::: We got to get the passengers to safety!
Cat Noir::: Can I lend a helping paw?
Ladybug::: Yeah, cover me!
Cat Noir::: Hurry up, my lady!
Ladybug::: Stop the bus!
Sarah::: Ladybug, what's happening?
Ladybug::: One of your actors has been akumatized, and for some reason, he's seemed to heading in for your troupe!
Sarah::: Fred?
Ladybug::: Stay inside and don't panic. We'll get this under control.
Chris:::Ladybug, I know why he's after us. I took his role from him. But he can perform instead of me! I don't care anymore! Please, just keep us all safe...
Sarah::: What do you mean you took his role from him? He lost it!
Chris::: Not exactly. There's something I have to tell you.
Hawk Moth::: His Miraculous is within your reach! I want his ring!
Ladybug::: I don't know what's made you this violent, but I don't think your daughter Mylène would approve!
Cat Noir::: He sure brings a whole new meaning to silent but deadly.
Ladybug::: Ughhh...shoebox appears)
Cat Noir::: A shoebox? Great. There better be some explosive boots in there or something.
Ladybug::: Of course! We have to make him really angry! Blow his fuse!
Cat Noir::: You don't think he's angry enough?
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, you're good at annoying people, do your thing!
Cat Noir::: Hey!... That is true.
Ladybug:::Gotta borrow these.A watch, a magnifying glass, some light...Voila! A homemade projector. Hey, Mime! Nice poster, don't you think?
Ladybug::: Yes! Remember, he can only mime one thing at a time.
Cat Noir::: So he's cornered. Good thinking, my lady.Yoink!
Ladybug::: No more evildoing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug!
Fred::: What happened? How did I... get here?
Ladybug and Cat Noir::: Pound it!
Sarah::: I'm so sorry I didn't believe you, Fred.
Chris::: I'm sorry too. I was so desperate to perform that I lied to you about where we were meeting up.
Cat Noir::: Your earrings!
Ladybug::: Better get going.
Cat Noir::: Such a shame. I could have been your date in the play tonight. Just you and me.
Ladybug::: Thanks, but I have other plans.
Hawk Moth::: The show's not over yet, Ladybug. You just wait. There's still a last act to come when you least expect it. 
Marinette::: Got it!
Adrien:::Ah, hey, you're here too, cool. Thought I was gonna end up sitting by myself.
Alya::: Hey, did you bring my phone? 
Marinette::: I don't know which I loved more. The show or sitting next to my sweet Adrien!
Alya::: Maybe you should give him a call and ask him out to a movie.
Marinette::: Speaking of calling, there's something I gotta tell you, Alya. I...accidentally erased your Ladybug video on your phone, and then, when I tried to fix the problem I dropped the phone in a dumpster and now it stinks like bad, like really, really bad, and I'm sorry, so, so, so sorry. I know how much that video meant to you and I'm the lamest of friends. Lamer than lame!
Alya:::Chillax, lady. If there's anyone on this earth who knows about your legendary clumsiness, it's me, your BFF!
Marinette::: So... You're not angry?
Alya::: Well, you should've just come clean and told me in the first place. But no, we're cool. Besides, I uploaded the video on to my Ladyblog before I showed it to you.
Marinette:::I'm so lucky to have a friend like you! Now that we're good, you probably don't care about the surprise I planned for you.
Alya:::Screw up or no screw-up, you know I love surprises!
Marinette::: Okay, you see that theater over there? There's something inside for you, on the stage.
Ladybug::: Hello! Alya, right?Last time I saw you, I was in a hurry, but I've got a bit more time now if you want to interview me for your Ladyblog.
Alya:::No... Seriously? Do I? Do I?! 
Ladybug::: Have a seat.
Alya::: You don't know me, but FYI, this is like the biggest moment of my life! 
Tikki::: Alya's lucky to have you as a friend too, you know!
Marinette::: Well?Show me!
Alya::: Only after I put it on my blog! There's no way I'm gonna lose this video!
Marinette::: Hey!
