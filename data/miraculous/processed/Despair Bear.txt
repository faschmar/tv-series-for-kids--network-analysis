Tom::: I'll let you in on a little secret. I always add cream to the chocolate to make the ganache extra velvety. Then I let infuse for one minute.
Alya:::I love it when your dad comes to class and gives us pastry lessons!
Marinette:::So does he!
Chloé::: Urgh! Do they seriously think I'm going to get my hands dirty, cooking like some maid? If I want a croissant, I'd just make my butler get it for me.
Rose::: He's not making croissants, Chloé. Those are macarons!
Tom::: It's all done with a flick of the wrist. But you mustn't go too fast or you might splash yourself!
Chloé::: And soil my Chenal pants? Who's he kidding?
Tom::: Look at this lovely emulsion.
Rose::: It's beautiful!
Tom::: Now we need to chill it for half an hour. Marinette? 
Marinette:::Yes, dad?
Tom::: Could you put this in the school cafeteria fridge for me, please? In the meantime, I'm going to show your friends how to whip up egg whites!
Marinette::: Of course!
Tikki::: Mmm, can I get a taste?
Marinette::: Not yet, Tikki. Control that sweet tooth of yours. 
Marinette::: Hide, Tikki!
Miss Bustier::: Quietly, students. Single file line, please. Just keep moving.
Student::: Excuse me.
Tom::: I hope it's only a fire drill.
Mr. Damocles::: So, some smart aleck had the bright idea of calling the fire department.Somebody amongst us thought it would be funny to waste the fire captain's valuable time.
Fireman::: Yes, in fact, if you wouldn't mind I...
Marinette:::I'm sure it was Chloé. I saw her on her phone right before the alarm went off!
Alya::: You seeing her make a phone call isn't solid proof. 
Marinette::: 
Chloé::: Mr. Damocles, sir?
Mr. Damocles::: Yes, Miss Bourgeois?
Chloé::: I saw a student leaving the classroom right before the alarm went off. It must have been her.
Chloé::: Let's see if she'll come clean. What do you say, Marinette Dupain-Cheng? 
Mr. Damocles::: Marinette, do you have something to tell the firefighter captain?
Adrien::: Urgh, wait. Excuse me, sir!It couldn't possibly be Marinette. Why would she disrupt her own father's cooking class?
Alya::: And I know for a fact that Marinette didn't even have her phone on her when she went out of the classroom.
Fireman::: Mr. Damocles, I must be heading out.
Mr. Damocles::: Just one more second. We're very close to discovering the truth.
Chloé::: Oh well, we all know it can't be me!
Marinette::: I'm not gonna let her get away with this. I've gotta tell...
Adrien::: Hang on, Marinette. We don't know for sure it was her. 
Alya::: He's right. Let's not stoop to her level.
Fireman::: I really have to leave now. Just call me if you find out who the prankster is. 
Mr. Damocles::: Fine. Since no one is owning up, the whole school will be punished. 
Chloé::: What?! I'm not so sure my father will react kindly to me being punished without any proof! gets out her phone, preparing to call her dad
Mr. Damocles:::Oh, no! Please, don't disrupt the busy mayor.The whole school is punished except for Miss Bourgeois! 
Chloé::: That's more like it.
Mr. Damocles::: Now you know how we deal with anyone who misuses the fire department's time.
Fireman::: Okay, great! Bye! 
Alya::: Do you see what just went down?
Marinette::: I know. Adrien just talked in my ear!
Alya:::Seriously, Marinette?
Chloé:::Can't you see I'm trying to relax here? Go sweep somewhere else, Cinderella!
Chloé::: Adrikins!
Chloé::: Of course it was me who called the fire department. So what?
Adrien::: And it doesn't bother you that everyone's being punished because of you?
Chloé::: No. Why would it? They all seem to enjoy getting dirty making cookies. How's it any different than getting dirty, cleaning floors? They should be thanking me if anything. 
Adrien:::Chloé, how long have you and I been friends?
Chloé::: Since we were adorable little tots, Adrikins. 
Adrien:::Well, I'm sorry Chloé, but I can't be friends with someone who treats other people like this. You've gotta be nice to people!
Chloé::: N-Nice?
Adrien::: Yes, nice. It's not that hard.
Jean::: Mademoiselle does not look very happy, today. 
Chloé::: Adrien says I have to be nice to everyone or he won't be my friend anymore! How can he do this to me, Jean-Michel?
Jean::: Uh, my name is... hm, never mind. Ah, perhaps Mademoiselle can see comfort with Mr. Cuddly?
Jean::: If you would allow it, Mademoiselle, I could help you keep your friendship with Adrien.
Chloé::: W-why would you do a thing like that, Jean-Jacques?
Jean::: Because that's what being nice is all about, Mademoiselle. 
Jean::: I'm sure Mademoiselle can remember when she was a little girl when Mr. Cuddly was always nice to Mademoiselle when she was sad. Mr. Cuddly can teach you how to be kind to others!
Chloé:::I remember, Jean-Luc. Adrien's going to see just how nice I can be.
Marinette::: And these are jewels I designed that you can customize yourselves.
Rose::: Oooh. They are so cute.
Alya::: Hold on, nobody move.This one would make an awesome homepage image for your future blog. Wouldn't it?Chloé?
Marinette::: What does that bratty snob want?
Alya::: Chloé's inviting me to a party.
Rose::: Huh, me too!
Juleka::: Me too.
Mylène::: Me too.
Rose::: That's so nice of Chloé!
Marinette::: Chloé and nice in the same sentence? Can't be her.
Mylène::: Maybe somebody hacked her phone then.
Marinette:::I haven't received a text.
Alya::: Then that means it must be from Chloé! 
Chloé::: Urgh! The baker girl as well?
Jean::: It's what Mr. Cuddly would do, yes.
Marinette::: Hm? Ewww, She invited me!
Rose::: Awesome! This will be so much fun!
Marinette::: Wait! You're actually going to go?
Mylène::: She probably wants to say sorry for this morning. Maybe's she's nice. Very, very, deep down.
Marinette::: Chloé? No, she's the exact opposite of nice! Whatever, you guys can go but don't count me in.
Alya::: It's Nino. He's going to the party with Adrien.
Marinette:::O-okay, yes, you guys are right! We should totally give Chloé one more chance!
Hawk Moth::: A party being thrown by the most spiteful girl in all of Paris? Such a fertile breeding ground for negative emotions!Fly away, my evil akuma! Finding a victim to evilize should be a piece of cake!
Jean::: Mademoiselle should go downstairs and greet her guests in a welcoming manner with a hug and a kiss.
Chloé::: Uh, you're kidding, Jean-Claude. You really expect me to let their cheeks touch mine?
Jean::: Well, that's what Mr. Cuddly would do.This way, you will prove to your good friend, Adrien that you really are nice.
Marinette::: This whole party thing is way weird.
Adrien::: Well, I've known Chloé for a long time. She can be really cool, sometimes!
Chloé:::Adrikins!What do you think of me hosting this party? Really nice of me, right? 
Adrien::: It's awesome, Chloé! 
Rose:::Hey, there! 
Kim:::Hey, Chloé! 
Max:::Thanks for the invite, Chloé. 
Alya:::I should have got you guys on video!
Marinette:::Don't rub it in.
Chloé::: I did it. Adrien seems happy. Are we done now?
Jean::: If I may be so bold, in order to reaffirm Adrien of her kindness, Mademoiselle might go and check that her guests are having a good time.
Chloé::: And why would I do that, Jean-Marc?
Jean::: Because that's what Mr. Cuddly would do!
Chloé:::Alright! Fine, I get it! 
Chloé:::Having a good time?
Mylène::: Whoa! All this dancing's made me thirsty. Do you know where the ice cubes are?
Chloé::: How should I know? I'm not your servant! Go and find them yourself! And if you're so hot, why don't you take off your fake sheep skin sweater? Throw it in the trash where it belongs!
Hawk Moth:::I knew I wouldn't have to wait very long!
Jean::: Ahem!
Chloé:::I'm totally joking. I love mutton! I'll get you those ice cubes! 
Hawk Moth:::What are you doing, Miss Bourgeois? Where's that natural cruelty I'm counting on?
Marinette::: This BFF act she's doing is just one big charade. She's just doing it to please Adrien.
Alya::: Ahem. How funny. That reminds me of a girl who didn't want to go to a party until she heard she heard Adrien would be there.
Marinette::: Please don't compare me to Chloé. 
Kim::: Chloé, how about a dance with an awesome guy?
Chloé::: I'd love it! Where is he?
Chloé::: Oh! Here is, right in front of me. 
Alya::: Go over and ask him, girl!
Marinette::: Uh, what?! Adrien?! No, you're crazy!
Adrien::: Hey, Marinette. Wanna dance?
Marinette:::I, uh...
Chloé:::What?! I am speechless!
Kim::: Thanks! You're a pretty good dancer, yourself.
Adrien::: See? Chloé's on her best behavior tonight.
Chloé::: I'm not letting her dance with Adrien under my roof!
Kim::: Hey, this song's not over yet!
Jean::: If I re-say, Mademoiselle, or to...
Chloé::: Move, Jean-Jacques!
Jean::: Oh, please, Chloé, dear! You've been such a good little girl! Mr. Cuddly is so very proud...
Kim::: Is that your teddy bear, Chloé?
Chloé::: I've had it with your stupid teddy bear, your stupid advice, and you, Jean, whatever your stupid name is!
Jean::: But, Mademoiselle, I was only trying to help.
Chloé::: There's no more Mademoiselle, no more help, no more anything! You are FIRED! Now get out!
Hawk Moth:::Ah, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. 
Hawk Moth::: Hello, Despair Bear. I am Hawk Moth. You've always been such a good influence on Chloé, but now, you get to be a bad influence for everyone, and a very evil one at that. 
Jean::: With great pleasure, sir!
Despair Bear::: You've been very naughty, Chloékins! And Despair Bear is not proud of you. The time has come to make you pay!
Sabrina:::Come here, Chloé.
Chloé::: Sabrina? What's gotten into you?
Sabrina::: Let me brush your hair! I promise I won't hurt you!
Chloé::: Ahh! Somebody stop her!
Kim::: If you touch one hair on Chloé's head, you'll have to answer to me.
Despair Bear::: Oh, what a gentleman. Despair Bear praises a knight in shining armor. 
Marinette::: Uh, I think I had too much orange juice. I gotta go. See ya.
Adrien::: No problem. I have something to do, anyway. See ya.
Sabrina::: Chloé?
Chloé::: Don't you come near me!
Sabrina::: Why? What's going on?
Chloé::: Kim, do something!
Kim::: Would you like to dance, Chloé?
Marinette::: I... I've gotta transform, Tikki. Too bad I had to stop dancing with Adrien. It felt like I was dancing on a little cloud. I'm out of body experience. It was like...
Tikki::: Marinette, focus. 
Marinette::: Okay, back down to Earth.
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Chloé:::Let go, you evil derp! You're messing up my hair!
Despair Bear::: I hope you're having fun, Chloékins!
Chloé:::About time, what took you so long?
Cat Noir::: That's a very slippery dance floor!
Person::: Look out!
Ladybug::: Move aside. All of you!
Cat Noir::: Look out! 
Max::: How about a little game...
Despair Bear::: Of flying chairs?
Alya::: Huh? Ladybug, what happened?
Ivan:::Huh, Cat Noir?
Cat Noir::: Huh? Where'd he go?
Ladybug::: Uh, what are you doing?Oh, no!
Hawk Moth::: Despair Bear, if you want to continue playing this game, give me Ladybug's Miraculous!
Despair Bear::: Oh, pretty earrings.
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, it's me! Stop it!
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm!
Chloé::: Paws off, kitty!
Ladybug::: Thank you!
Chloé::: Hey, I was really nice, just then. Did you see? No?You're all so lame.
Ladybug::: A fork appears.) A fork?
Despair Bear::: You little brat!
Chloé::: She's crazy, she's never going to make it without me.
Ladybug:::Okay! 
Chloé::: Hey, stop!
Despair Bear::: Naughty, naughty, Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Chloé, would you be so kind?
Chloé::: Okay, Ladybug!
Despair Bear::: No! Stop! What's happening?
Cat Noir::: Ladybug? What are you doing?
Ladybug::: Oh, nothing. Just saving your skin with the help of our new little sidekick.
Despair Bear:::Give me your Miraculous! You haven't defeated me, yet!
Ladybug::: Watch your step, Cat Noir!
Cat Noir:::I've got this guy under control.
Ladybug::: No more evildoing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug!
Ladybug:::Thanks for helping me out there. That was really nice of you.
Chloé::: I know, wasn't it?
Jean::: Mademoiselle, I must confess. I don't remember anything!
Chloé::: Well, basically, you turned evil and I saved you. In fact, without me, Ladybug and Cat Noir would never have succeeded. I'm even better than you superheroes. I don't even need a costume.
Cat Noir::: Gotta get going!
Ladybug::: Yeah, me too!
Chloé::: You know what? I'm suddenly feeling very generous. I think that thing of yours about being nice might actually make some sense. I've decided to keep you on, after all!
Jean::: Mademoiselle is so kind!
Chloé::: Don't let the guests go away, Jean-Baptiste. They mustn't miss what's coming up next! 
Hawk Moth::: Ladybug, if you haven't been helped, defeating you would have been child's play. So you better watch out. Your day of devastation is coming soon! 
Tom::: Great job, kids. You've done some really good work. 
Adrien::: That was a great idea of inviting Marinette's dad!
Chloé::: I know. This way, no one can be mad at me for calling the fire department. I'm really nice now, did you notice, Adrikins? Even Ladybug said so! Didn't she, Jean-Pascal?
Adrien::: I'm proud of you, Chloé. I think you've proven that you're capable of making an effort to be nicer to everyone.
Chloé::: Aww, Adrikins! So we'll always be best friends, forever? Pinky swear?
Adrien::: Pinky swear!
Chloé:::So, those macarons are dreadfully ugly.Those are so greasy, you can see yourself in them.Urgh. Too disgusting for comment.Those look horrible.
Adrien::: She'll never change! 
Adrien:::May I?
Marinette:::Yeah! Sure! I mean... Uh, what?
Adrien::: Have a macaron!
Marinette::: Yes, of course.Oh, sorry, I'm so clumsy!
Adrien::: It's okay.Wow, this is really good. Your baking is good as your dancing.
