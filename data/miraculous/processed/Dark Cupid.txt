Miss Bustier::: In most fairy tales, the prince breaks the spell by kissing the princess. Can anyone tell us why? 
Rose:::Because only love can conquer hate!
Miss Bustier::: Correct, Rose. 
Max::: Technically speaking, this reasoning is only exhibited in about 87% of all fairy tales and-
Miss Bustier::: Thank you, Max. That's enough.
Miss Bustier::: Adrien, I hope what you're writing has to do with my lesson.
Marinette::: 
Miss Bustier:::Can you tell me what I just said?
Adrien::: That's why in most fairy tales, the prince breaks the spell by kissing the princess because only love conquers hate.
Miss Bustier::: Very good, Adrien! Now, everyone, don't forget to finish Sleeping Beauty by Charles Perrault tonight, and happy Valentine's day, students!
Marinette:::Hey, go ahead, I'll meet you outside.
Alya::: Mhm.
Chloé::: Hi Adrien, sign here please.
Adrien:::Oh, come on, you know I hate signing autographs, Chloé.
Chloé::: Oh, that's not what this is. This is a petition against cruelty to hamsters. Have you seen some of the ugly sweaters they are forced to wear? It's appalling.
Chloé:::Well well, Marinette, looking for something to eat?
Sabrina::: Maybe she's looking for some better clothes!
Marinette::: Ughhh!
Tikki::: Don't give them the time of day, they don't deserve it.
Marinette::: You're right, Tikki.Your hair is dark as night, your pretty bluebell eyes, I wonder who you are beneath that strong disguise. Every day we see each other and I hope that you'll be mine, together our love could be so true, please, will you be my Valentine?
Tikki::: Whoa, now that's a love poem.
Marinette::: Who could he be talking about? Hair as dark as night, bluebell eyes?
Tikki::: Uh... you?
Marinette:::Me? No way. There are plenty of girls at school with dark hair and blue eyes.
Tikki::: Yeah, but bluebell eyes...
Marinette::: What do you think he means by strong disguise?
Tikki:::This is poetry. He means who you are deep down inside. He wants to get to know you Marinette! He's talking about you!
Marinette:::Pinch me!
Marinette::: Not literally!
Max::: Operation Valentine's Day is commencing. According to my extensive research and cross-referencing of online shopping sites, this particular jewel,was ranked highest in popularity.
Kim:::That's perfect, Max! I better hit a home run with this one. Love is like baseball, right? You gotta have a strategy or you'll strike out.But if you aim right, you'll hit it out of the ball park. Score!
Max::: Oh yes Kim, lovely metaphor.
Kim:::Meta-who?
Alya:::Ooh! Sparkly! Is that for moi?
Max:::Negative Alya. The recipient of this gem has already been determined, it's
Kim:::Shh! Keep it on the down-low!
Alya:::Scoop! Kim's got a major crush!Who's the lucky lady?
Marinette:::It's gorgeous Kim. She's gonna be ecstatic! 
Kim:::Technically, she's still gotta accept it.What if she says no!?
Marinette:::She won't Kim, no way!Don't hold back, Kim. Go for it, no regrets!
Kim::: Operation Valentine's Day is underway! 
Max:::Her route is highlighted here in yellow, yours in red. If you run at ten miles per hour you're going to gain a four and a half minute advance on her. Halt and wait here facing northwestthe third most romantic spot in Paris.Go go go!
Kim::: Thanks, you guys. 
Alya:::I know someone who's good at dishing out advice who can't take some herself.
Adrien::: Let's go.
Marinette::: You're right. It's time I told him.
Alya::: Say what?!
Marinette::: I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna tell Adrien my true feelings. Well... I'm gonna write them on a card, that is.
Alya:::Yeah!
Marinette::: Yeah! 
Alya & Marinette::: Operation Valentine's Day! 
Girls::: He's so cute!
Chloé::: Keep dreaming all you want girls but the Boy is mine.
Aurore::: To Chloé, the most awesome girl in the world and the love of my life. Signed, Adrien.
Chloé::: Uh, she's not crying enough.
Marinette::: Dear Adrien, dear Adrien... Dear Adrien...I'm no good at this love letter writing thing... I sound like a total dorkasaurus!
Tikki::: Only when you say words like dorkasaurus! Relax, Marinette, I'm teasing. Think of Adrien and speak from the heart.
Marinette:::Adrien's letter! That's it! Why didn't I think of that before? I'll answer his poem!
Alya::: Marinette!
Marinette::: 
Alya:::Check it out!
Marinette::: It's perfect! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Marinette::: Voila!
Alya::: Don't forget to sign it!
Alya::: This is a good omen! Ladybugs are good luck, especially in the love department!
Marinette::: Really?
Alya::: Yeah you of all people should know about ladybugs.
Marinette::: R-really? Wh-why do you say that?
Alya::: Since ancient times the ladybug has been a symbol of love, guiding hearts on the path to devotion. It was on my blog this week. You read it didn't you?
Marinette::: Oh yeah, yeah, of course. 
Plagg::: So she's got eyes, arms, legs, big deal! How can you possibly be in love with Ladybug? You don't even know who she really is!
Adrien:::You don't know anything about love...
Plagg::: Oh sure I do, I love Cheddar, I love Swiss and I love Camembert.
Plagg:::Aww, the poor Boy's frustrated because he can't finish the poem for his masked sweetheart?
Adrien::: I don't need a poem when I can tell her to her face... I love you.
Plagg::: Bleh, gross. You're making me lose my appetite.Almost.
Chloé::: And that's right, in a 24 karat gold frame. Deliver it to Le Grand Paris Hotel and bill it to Daddykins, uh, I mean, Mr. Bourgeois.What are you doing here? 
Kim:::I-I...
Chloé:::You-You...
Chloé:::Don't move!
Chloé::: Don't you just hate how harsh love can be?
Hawk Moth::: Ah, Valentine's Day, the day of love and the day of fools. So many delusions, so much disappointment. My evil akumas, you are going to have such a field day.
Hawk Moth::: Fly away my little akuma, and evilize him!
Hawk Moth::: Dark Cupid, I am Hawk Moth. I can give you the power to shoot your arrows, pierce love and impale friendship. But there is something you must do for me in return.
Kim::: No love affair or friendship will escape my fury. No one will ever love again!
Civilian:::Ugh, stupid flowers! 
Civilian:::Get off me! 
Dark Cupid::: Hahahahahaha!
Hawk Moth::: Hahaha! Perfect. It won't be long before Ladybug and Cat Noir show up to meet their doom! 
Tom::: Candy apples, girls?
Marinette:::Thanks, Papa.
Alya::: Come on, Marinette! Do it before you chicken out!
Alya::: Yeah!
Marinette::: I did it!
Alya::: Chloé? Since when did she start texting us?
Alya::: What a witch!
Marinette::: And I was the one who told Kim to do it! I didn't know he was talking about her!
Alya::: Dang, I hope Adrien doesn't do the same thing to you. I mean...
Marinette::: What have I done!?
Alya::: Girl, calm down! I was totally joking! Kind of... Adrien would never do that.What in the world is that?! 
Dark Cupid::: Huh?
Dark Cupid::: All hearts must be destroyed!
Marinette::: Alya?
Marinette::: Hey, seriously?!
Alya::: You're not my BFF, you're a joke! Adrien's gonna laugh his head off at your lame attempt at poetry! 
Marinette::: Alya!What did he do to her?I've seen that jewel somewhere before. It's Kim's pin! He's been akumatized!This is... not... good! We gotta find him, fast! 
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Chloé::: Ugh! I never said 18-karat gold! Those gold tones will never match my 24-karat toilet! Idiots!
Chloé::: 
Dark Cupid::: Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Stop, Kim!
Dark Cupid::: I'm not Kim, I'm Dark Cupid! I'll never stop! If I can't have love, then no one can!
Ladybug::: Okay, Dark Cupid, I get it. Chloé totally burned you. But that doesn't mean you have to take it out on all of Paris!
Dark Cupid::: Oh yes, I do! I won't stop until everyone's heart is crushed. Say adios to your loved ones. From now on, you'll hate them!
Hawk Moth::: If you want to continue destroying love, bring me Ladybug's Miraculous, or I'll remove your powers!
Cat Noir::: Falling for me already, my lady?I need to talk to you.
Ladybug::: It’s going to have to wait. Dark Cupi-
Cat Noir:::I swore to myself that I'd tell you as soon as I saw you. Ladybug, I-I... Look out!
Ladybug:::Cat Noir!
Cat Noir:::Ladybug, I—I... loathe you!
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, snap out of it!
Cat Noir:::You're nothing Ladybug, and nothing to me! I hate you!
Chloé::: Ladybug, it's about time, where have you been?
Hawk Moth:::Offer to help him in return for Ladybug's Miraculous.
Dark Cupid:::I can help you crush Ladybug, but you must give me her Miraculous in return. 
Cat Noir::: No...problem. 
Hawk Moth::: Yes. Yes! And once I have Ladybug's Miraculous, taking Cat Noir's will be child's play!
Ladybug::: You gotta get out of here. Your friend Kim's turned into Dark Cupid and I don't know what he'll do if he finds you here.
Chloé::: Moi? But how could he possibly have a vendetta against me?
Ladybug:::Who doesn't?
Chloé::: Duh! It's because of this. Everyone would love to get their hands on it.. That's Adrien, a super hot guy in my class. And rich, too! He's hot for me of course.
Sabrina:::It's alive!
Chloé::: Daddy!
Ladybug::: Run, Chloé, run!
Cat Noir::: Well, well, Ladybug.
Ladybug::: I don't want to fight you, Cat Noir.
Cat Noir::: Ugh, that friendliness. It's so revolting. You are definitely not my friend!
Ladybug::: Why are you so full of hate, Cat Noir?!
Cat Noir::: Because hate conquers all!
Ladybug::: I hate to burst your bubble, but hate doesn't conquer all. Love does! 
Miss Bustier::: The prince breaks the spell by kissing the princess.
Rose::: Only love can conquer hate!
Cat Noir::: You're just buying time! Fight!
Ladybug::: I'll do better than that.
Ladybug::: Come on, kitty kitty, just a peck...Almost!
Cat Noir:::Get back, you savage!
Ladybug::: Here, kitty kitty kitty! Come here!
Dark Cupid:::You can't outrun me, Chloé!
Chloé::: Help!
Dark Cupid::: Happy Valentine's Day, Chloé. Now you'll get what you deserve.
Chloé::: My hair! There is nothing worse in this world than a bad hair day! First, Ladybug wrinkles my new jacket, second, you totally ruined my hair! Just go ahead and just change me already! This day can't get any worse...
Dark Cupid::: I don't need to waste this arrow on you. Your heart is so dark and shriveled, there's no room for love. 
Chloé::: Ugh! How dare you talk to me like that?Huh? Why are you just standing there? Help me up!
Sabrina::: Ha! You think I'd help someone as stuck up as you?Wait till everyone gets a load of this! 
Chloé::: Ughhh...
Cat Noir::: No, no! 
Ladybug::: Don't worry, I'm not looking forward to it either.I can't believe I'm doing this.
Cat Noir::: How you gonna fight both of us now, bug eyes?Cataclysm!
Cat Noir::: I've often wondered what would happen if I use my Cataclysm on someone.
Ladybug::: candy apple appears) A candy apple? What am I supposed to do with this? Think, Ladybug...
Ladybug::: Hey! I've got a Valentine's gift for you! 
Ladybug::: Looks like you got yourself in a sticky situation!
Dark Cupid::: Ladybug!! 
Ladybug::: And now, for the pussy-cat! 
Dark Cupid::: Cat Noir, her Miraculous!
Cat Noir::: With pleasure! Finally, I'll find out who you are, Ladybug! Your little secret will be out of the bag! 
Cat Noir::: Huh?What am I doing here? 
Ladybug::: No time! The quiver pin, Cat Noir! Now!Grab it! Grab the pin!
Dark Cupid::: No!
Cat Noir::: Sorry, need that.Happy Valentine's Day! 
Ladybug::: Awww, you shouldn't have...Whoops!No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! 
Alya:::What the heck am I doing?
Chloé:::What the heck are you doing?!
Sabrina:::I have no idea!
Kim:::Huh?
Ladybug & Cat Noir::: Pound it!
Ladybug:::Oops!
Cat Noir::: Wait, Ladybug! I gotta tell you something.
Ladybug::: Look, the kiss... I had to break the spell, or...
Cat Noir::: Kiss? What kiss? No, I just wanted to say... 
Ladybug::: Look out, Cat Noir, your ring is flashing!
Cat Noir::: Uhh... yours too!
Ladybug:::We're about to turn into pumpkins, and personally, I'd rather not see that. 
Hawk Moth::: Grrr... blasted Ladybug! Blasted Valentine's Day! 
Tikki::: Hey, there's your chance to get your card back!
Marinette::: That was before...
Tikki::: Before what? Tell me!
Marinette::: I realized that even with all this hate everywhere, love still wins. But if I wanna win over Adrien, he needs to know the truth about how I feel.
Tikki::: Ah! This is a big day!
Plagg::: Hahaha! Can you believe all the horrible thoughtless things you said to Ladybug? 
Adrien::: You think it's funny, huh?Ugh!
Plagg::: What's the big deal? You've got so many cards from all these lady fans of yours! Take your pick!
Adrien:::Whoa, hold up! Someone answered my poem? But I threw it away!Your hair shines like the sun, your eyes are gorgeous green, I look at you and wonder your innermost thoughts and dreams. Yes, your Valentine I will be, our love will be so true, together for eternity, my heart belongs to you. 
Plagg::: Aww, well, anyone who writes as sickeningly sweet as you must be your soulmate.
Adrien::: It isn't signed...Could it have come from Ladybug?
Plagg::: Oh, please.
Alya::: What do you mean, you don't remember? Did you sign the card or not?
Marinette::: I don't know! The ladybug came along while I was writing, then you were yapping about your blog, and then... It's all a blur!
Alya:::I don't believe you! The girl didn't even sign it! I love you and all, but sometimes you seriously bug! You know that, right?
