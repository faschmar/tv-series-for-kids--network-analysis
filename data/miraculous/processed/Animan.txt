Marinette:::Leo: Your heart's gonna roar.Wow, roar!
Adrien:::FYI, Marinette's never going to fall in love with a statue.
Nino::: Shhh! You know I'm no good with the ladies, especially this one all of a sudden. I mean, dude, do I go up to her and crack her a joke? Shoot her a compliment? Invite her to the zoo? Play it serious?
Adrien::: Nino, you're way over-thinking this. Invite her to the zoo, you serious?
Nino::: Well, they have this really cool new exhibit there.
Adrien::: Listen, just be yourself, man.
Nino::: That's easy for you to say, Mr. Front-of-the-cover-Teen-Model-weekly. I'm not that cool.
Adrien::: You're cool too, dude, trust me - or you wouldn't be my best bud. Invite her to the zoo. She'll say yes, I promise.
Nino:::What if I act like a moronosaurus, or she disses me or thinks I'm lame or - ?
Adrien::: Okay, I got your back. 
Marinette:::Oh, he's such a—
Alya::: Smartie, hottie, suavísimo, yummy-tastic spellbinder!
Marinette::: All of the above.Huh?
Adrien:::Oh, so sorry.Right, Nino?
Nino::: Sorry.
Marinette:::Ahh!
Marinette and Adrien::: Sorry. 
Adrien::: Sorry about that. How could we make it up to you? Any ideas...Nino?How about we all check out the...zoo today? Word is they've got a new... 
Nino::: Uh, they-they got a new panther.
Alya::: Awesome idea, right, Marinette? You love animals.
Marinette::: Uh, yeah. I, uh, I'm really into zoonimals. I mean, uh, anizools. I mean zoonimoos. I... 
Adrien::: Cool. Say, after school, four o'clock?Nino, sound good?Cool, four o'clock then.
Marinette::: Four!Four o'clock.Yeah...
Alya::: Uh, Earth to Marinette? You do realize the guy you're completely crazy about has just asked you out, right?
Marinette::: Yeah...Huh, wait, what?! No, not like this!Not here, not today! I haven't washed my hair! I'm not wearing my lucky socks! Fine! Help me, Alya! I can't do this alone! 
Nino::: How did you do that, dude?
Adrien::: Like I said: Just be yourself.
Nino::: Right, sure. If I could be yourself; myself don't work that way.
Adrien:::You're being ridiculous. Of course you can. And when you're alone with Marinette at the zoo later on— 
Nino::: Whoa, what do you mean alone with Marinette? Oh no, dude. You're coming with me. You can't leave me alone by myself. Uh-uh.
Adrien:::No prob, Nino. What are friends for? 
Alya:::One, two, one, two, testing. D'you read me, girl?
Marinette::: I can hear you. But I still don't think I can go through with this.
Alya::: 'Course you can. Just be yourself!
Marinette::: Remember the last time I did that? 
Alya::: Just be yourself, Marinette.
Boys::: Hey! What're you doing in here? Get out!Get out! Boys' room! 
Alya::: Fine, just be yourself and look where you're going.
Marinette::: Oh, where are you, love of my life?
Tikki::: How's Adrien supposed to be the love of your life if you can't even talk to him?
Marinette:::Tikki, stay out of sight. I'm gonna talk to him, you'll see. I will speak to him!
Alya::: That's right, girl! Way to be motivated!
Marinette::: YeahAh, there they are!
Kim:::Hey, Marinette!
Marinette:::False alarm.Hey, Kim, Max; what are you doing here?
Kim::: We heard the new panther's here. I wanna see who's get the bigger guns! 
Max::: Do you want to come with us?
Alya:::Marinette, target at ten o'clock!
Marinette::: NO!!!Aha, I mean, uh, thanks but...no thanks. I'm waiting for someone. Uh, you go ahead.
Kim::: 'Kay, maybe we'll see you later, then. 
Marinette::: Yeah, later!Where's Adrien? 
Alya:::I don't know.
Marinette::: Uh, hey, Nino!Uh, isn't Adrien with you?
Adrien::: Tell her you'll both be better off without me.
Nino:::We'll be better off without me.
Marinette:::Huh?
Plagg:::Ah, this trip is turning out to be a lot more interesting than I thought. Turn up the volume! 
Nino::: Uh, without him. I mean, we don't need Adrien to hang out at the zoo.
Alya:::Of course we do, you dumbo!
Marinette::: Of course we do, you dumb—oh I mean, wasn't he supposed to come? Don't you wanna wait for him?
Adrien:::Tell her you want to be alone with her.
Nino:::Not yet!
Marinette::: What was that?
Nino:::You're right; we'll wait.
Adrien:::No! What are you talking about? Don't wait for me; I'm not coming!
Otis::: Look what Daddy's brought you. Only the finest for my baby.
Kim::: Whoa! Look at the size of that piece of meat it's eating!
Max::: Typical diet for a feline species requiring the strength to run at speeds in excess of 60 miles per hour.
Kim::: 60 miles per hour? Is that all? I thought panthers were much faster than that. I bet that I could beat it in a race.
Otis::: Impossible. No human being could compete with my panther.
Kim::: Is that so? What place did your cat come in at the County Athletics Tournament? I came in first place.
Otis::: You can't possibly compare yourself to my panther, kiddo!
Kim::: No need to. I'm obviously the better looking one.
Kim::: Hey, kitty, kitty. How about a little race with me, huh? Last one's a rotten egg!
Max::: Let's see. With a 6 feet-per-second win behind you and 45 degrees to the north-east... I don't think you'd be a rotten egg. You'd be lunch.
Otis::: Your friend's right, kiddo. Now please leave. She needs peace and quiet while she eats. You're stressing her out.
Kim::: Awww, stressed out, are we, Miss Panthie? You're talking about a wild animal, dude. 
Otis::: Leave now! Or I'll have you kicked out of the zoo immediately!
Kim::: Come on, Max. Let's leave that poor widdle kitty alone with its angwy babysitter! Ha ha ha!
Hawk Moth:::Unleashing the animal in each of us. I like that idea.Go ahead, my little evil akuma, fly off and take control of that zookeeper!
Marinette::: You sure taking us time, huh? He's not coming, is he?
Adrien:::Repeat after me. Yes heis, but first I wanted to take this opportunity to...
Nino::: Yes he is, but first I wanted to take this opportunity to...
Adrien:::Tell you that I love you, Marinette.
Nino::: Tell you that I Gahhh... I... Love a girl that I don't know how to tell her!
Adrien::: Hey, what are you doing?
Marinette::: You do? Well, I can help you with that.
Nino::: You could?
Alya:::You, giving expert advice on how to tell someone you love them?Can't wait to hear this one!
Marinette:::Can't wait to hear this one...
Nino::: What?
Marinette::: Uhh... Can't wait to hear... about this lucky girl!
Nino::: Oh, yeah...
Adrien:::Tell her it's you!
Nino::: It's youuu...uur best friend Alya!
Adrien, Alya and Marinette::: What?!
Marinette::: Alya? Awesome!
Alya::: No! No! It's not awesome!
Marinette:::I can fix up a date for you guys!
Alya::: Say what?! Seriously?!You didn't even ask me first!Uh-uh! Nino's like... a brother to me! Bleugh! No! End of discussion!
Marinette::: He's gonna be so sad if you don't.
Nino::: Did you say something?
Marinette::: I said... It'd be so sad if you didn't tell her!
Hawk Moth::: Animan, I am Hawk Moth. I offer you the power to seek revenge, for a small price.
Otis::: Yes, Hawk Moth. 
Animan:::Hey, kiddo. Still up for a little race? Go ahead, I'll give you a head start.He's mine.
Alya:::This whole date thing with Nino is not happening! Ugh!
Kim::: HE'S COMING!
Max::: Get outta here!
Nino::: We better ditch this place! 
Tikki::: Why didn't you listen to Alya, Marinette?
Marinette::: I couldn't help it!I didn't want Nino to be sad.
Tikki::: We'll deal with that later. Now it's time to transform!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Adrien::: We've gotta do something. 
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Animan::: You lost, kiddo. What do you think of panthers now?
Kim::: That... panthers are the best?
Ladybug::: And what do you think about ladybugs?
Cat Noir::: And another black cat?
Animan::: I think I'm higher on the food chain.
Hawk Moth::: Animan, take their jewels! Their Miraculouses! Bring them to me!
Ladybug::: If you value your life, get out of here! Now!
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, his bracelet. The akuma must be inside the charm!
Cat Noir::: You hold him, I grab the bracelet.
Animan:::Attack!
Cat Noir::: We need to put them all back in their cages!
Ladybug::: Oh, really? I'm sure they'll do it without putting up a fight!
Ladybug::: I think we'd better split up! 
Nino::: Hey!
Alya::: Hey!
Nino::: What the...?
Ladybug:::Stay here and you'll be safe. 
Nino:::Uhh... Hey, what's up?
Ladybug::: There are too many of them! We can't capture them all.
Cat Noir::: Well, what are we gonna do then?
Ladybug::: Back to Plan A. If we can destroy his bracelet, I can capture the akuma. Everything will go back to normal!
Cat Noir::: Sounds like a good idea!
Ladybug::: But... it's never been broken before!
Cat Noir::: He didn't actually break it. 
Ladybug::: Then how did he get away?
Cat Noir::: I don't know, but we better find Kim... I mean, that Boy, before he does. 
Cat Noir::: Over there!
Ladybug::: 
Animan::: It's down to just the two of us, Kiddo.And then there was one. 
Ladybug::: You're not getting away this time!
Cat Noir:::Quick, go and hide in the first building you come to. 
Animan::: You'll never get me! 
Cat Noir::: Now we know how we got away earlier.
Ladybug::: Where's Kim?Good job, kitty. 
Kim::: Help! Rescue me! Please!
Tom::: It's okay, son. Come this way. Easy.
Cat Noir::: He's safe inside this building. Panthers can't open doors, so it won't get inside.
Ladybug::: Panthers can't, but what if he morphs into a smaller animal? Like a mouse, or...
Cat Noir::: Right. But we do have an advantage over him. We know exactly where to find his prey.
Ladybug::: Animan will sniff him out sooner or later, but it's bought us a bit of time to plan our next move.
Cat Noir::: We have to stop Animan before Paris turns into a Jungle.
Ladybug::: Follow me.
Ladybug::: Hi, mo...am.
Sabine::: Oh, you're... you're, you're Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Yeah, exactly.
Nadja::: We interrupt this broadcast with a special report. Animals are invading Paris. The police work harder trying to contain the situation. For your safety, stay in your home and remain calm. Mayor Bourgeois will address the 
Ladybug::: You'll be safe here. Can I borrow this?
Kim::: Sure. 
Ladybug::: Come on, Cat Noir. Make sure you lock all the doors and windows.
Cat Noir::: We'll take care of the rest. You won't be in danger.
Ladybug::: Thanks Da I mean, sir, for all your help.
Tom::: You're welcome, Ladybug.
Ladybug::: Et voila.
Cat Noir::: Whoa! What's that stuff?
Ladybug::: Air freshener! It'll cover up our scent so he can't smell us.
Cat Noir:::Thanks.I've always wanted to smell like... Ocean summer breeze?Couldn't we capture him inside something like this?
Ladybug::: Only if he transforms into something bigger.Would that make a big enough cage?
Cat Noir::: Definitely. But how could we get him inside there?He's coming.
Ladybug::: It's working. He's sniffing out Kim!Follow me.
Ladybug::: A Ladybug? Smart choice. 
Cat Noir::: Couldn't he choose a slower-moving animal?!
Ladybug::: Where's the button for the doors?Of course nothing works! No keys!
Hawk Moth::: Take his Miraculous... The ring! The ring!
Ladybug::: All these transformations seem to be tiring him out.
Cat Noir::: Then just let him wear himself out. It'll make it easier to capture his akuma. Cataclysm! 
Ladybug::: It's not exactly a cage, but... it'll do. 
Cat Noir::: I don't think he can bear to listen to that noise.
Ladybug::: You around is too much to bear. Now we wait.
Cat Noir::: Ready to free the akuma?
Ladybug::: It's working!
Cat Noir::: Hey! Since when do extinct animals count?
Ladybug::: The T-Rex might have disappeared a long time ago, but technically it's.. still an animal. 
Cat Noir::: Well, I know some other animals that will soon be extinct... The cat and the ladybug! 
Ladybug::: Lucky Charm!Huh? A car jack?
Cat Noir::: Too bad Animan doesn't have any flat tires.
Ladybug::: Look how small his front arms are.
Cat Noir::: So it won't be great at basketball. What are you getting at?
Ladybug::: You climb on top of him where he can't swipe at you, and while you're distracting him, I'll floor him!
Cat Noir::: Sounds like a good plan. I can be very distracting.
Ladybug::: Well, that's weird, we didn't have to use this. What does it mean?
Cat Noir::: Well, I guess that only means we rock as a team.
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, wait!I know what to do. 
Cat Noir::: Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Enjoy your meal! 
Cat Noir::: No!You're so gonna pay for this!
Ladybug::: No more evildoing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug!Pound it? 
Cat Noir::: Ladybug! That was a wild ride.Whoops! Better take my whiskers and run! 
Ladybug::: See you next time, Cat Noir.
Otis::: Oh! What happened to me?
Ladybug::: Everything's okay. But you should get back to the zoo and check on your animals.
Hawk Moth:::You ruined everything, Ladybug. This is not how it was supposed to end! But I promise you, one day it will be me at the top of the food chain! And you'll be nothing! 
Marinette:::Oh no! I forgot all about Alya! She's gonna be so mad at me!
Tikki::: And imagine if she knew you're the Ladybug who shut her up in a cage with Nino!
Marinette::: Yeah, and she'd actually kill me. Guess I'll take mad, huh.Listen Alya, I'm sorry about earlier. I should have never toldNino I set up a date with you. I just wasn't thinking. But I'll explain everything to him, so don't worry. Promise. Do you forgive me? 
Alya::: Thanks, Nino.
Nino::: Do you want one, Marinette?
Marinette::: Uhh...What's he doing here?
Alya::: Ladybug locked us up together in the same cage all afternoon.
Nino::: It turns out we have lots in common. You know, Marinette, the girl I've got a crush on?
Marinette::: Oh, yeah!
Nino::: Actually, it was you.
Marinette::: Huh?
Nino::: Or that's what I thought. But after chilling with Alya that whole time...
Alya:::Yeah, well...we don't have to give her all the deets, do we?
Nino::: Oh, yeah, my bad.
Alya::: The funniest part of it was that Nino was being totally coached by Adrien at the zoo!
Alya::: Yup! LOL, huh?
Nino::: Alya tells me you've been crushing on some dude.
Marinette::: Huh?!
Alya::: He doesn't know who it is! Pinky swear! Cause... cause I don't go and make decisions for other people!
Nino::: But if you want, I could totally make it happen!That is, if I knew the dude!
Alya::: Nino!
Nino::: Fine. Pretend I never said anything. But if I...can help.
Alya::: Nino!
