Chloé:::This is rubbish! Ugh, I don't have a thing to wear!This one is way too pink!Those are so last season!Those don't cost nearly as much.And these are never in season! Agh, I hate all of these!Hmm?Is someone there? Anybody? 
Chloé::: Hey, wait!Come back, shoes! It's not true, I love you!
Marinette::: Whoa, look at Chloé. 
Alya::: That girl is a total rag.
Marinette::: Maybe she's missing her BFF?
Alya::: Sabrina have been absent since yesterday, huh? 
Chloé::: Ow!
Ms. Mendeleiev::: What is it, Chloé?
Chloé::: Someone pulled my hair! 
Mylène::: I didn't do it, Ms. M.
Chloé::: It wasn't her, it's-it's some invisible mystical being. Like a leprechaun. Or a unicorn without the horn. 
Ms. Mendeleiev::: Quiet, everyone! Eyes on your papers!
Chloé:::Oh, it's happening again. Oh, wah! 
Ms. Mendeleiev::: Chloé, sit down!
Chloé::: I can't!My purse is beating me up! 
Ms. Mendeleiev::: Chloé, we don't run in the classroom! Get back to your seat!
Ms. Mendeleiev::: Compose yourself, Miss Bourgeois.
Marinette:::Tikki, we got to get out of here.
Adrien::: Miss, please, I have to go to the restroom.Thank you. 
Marinette::: So do I, please?
Tikki::: Somebody seems to have it in for Chloé.
Marinette::: Huh, the hard part's gonna be finding out who doesn't.
Adrien::: Something really strange going on.
Marinette and Adrien:::Time to transform!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Yeah! 
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out! 
André::: Damaging my daughter's reputation is the same as soiling the reputation of the Mayor of Paris, umm, which is me. And an attack on Chloé is an attack on Paris.
Cat Noir::: We'll find the culprit, Mr. Bourgeois. You have my word.
André::: Chloé, my darling. We got special guests for you.
Chloé:::Ladybug!I knew you'd come to save me! You know, considering what good friends we are!
André::: I have to put out an emergency call to all the biggest designers. Can you imagine? My daughter wearing department-store clothing? How humiliating.
Ladybug::: Have you had any run-ins with anyone lately?
Chloé::: I never have run-ins with anyone. Everybody absolutely love me.
Ladybug::: Really? Not even with your closest friend? 
Chloé::: Ah, Sabrina?Impossible. She adores me, I'm her idol!
Ladybug:::Your daughter's safe here with the doors and windows locked. This enemy may be invisible, but it can't go through walls.
Chloé:::I'm sure you'll make my life perfect again! Just like it was before!
Cat Noir::: Is something up? You seem…
Ladybug::: She's hiding something.
Ladybug::: Whatever you tell us won't go any farther than this room.
Butler Jean::: Mademoiselle did have a run-in with someone.
Butler Jean::: Miss Chloé and her friend Sabrina like to impersonate Ladybug and Cat Noir.
Chloé:::Aha! 
Butler Jean::: I was playing the part of Big Mustachio that day. 
Ladybug::: Big Mustachio?
Butler Jean::: One of Mademoiselle's ideas. Big Mustachio want all Parisians to be deface with heinous mustaches.
Cat Noir::: Wow, what a hairy situation. 
Ladybug:::Please go on. 
Nadja::: Thank you for granting this exclusive interview for your upcoming album, Mr. Stone. Can you tell us how-?
Chloé::: Jagged!
Jagged:::Ladybug! What are you doing here?
Chloé::: Um… when I find out you're here, I knew you wanted to see me! I have to come and say hello. 
Jagged::: Well, you did the right thing.Hey, what's the dealio with your hair? 
Chloé::: Oh, ah… ha. The old hair was so drab. This color is amazing.Don't you think? I got a few minutes to spare. I'm sure you'd jump at the chance to interview me!
Jagged::: Hey, wait! I thought you're coming by to say hi to me?
Chloé::: And I did! Now where were we?
Ladybug::: She pretended she was me?! How often does that happen?
Butler Jean::: She idolizes you. 
Sabrina:::Chloé, I found Big Mustachio!
Jagged::: Chloé? But-
Nadja Chamack::: You're not Ladybug!You're a fake!
Chloé:::No, I'm not! I'm Ladybug! Look!
Sabrina::: But, Chloé, how was I suppose to know? 
Chloé:::That's the problem! You never know anything! Ah, that crocodile has a larger brain than you!Get out! I never want to see you again! 
Butler Jean::: Mademoiselle does argue with her friend Sabrina at times.I'd even go so far to say that it's the norm. But it was different this time. Sabrina came back the next day…
Chloé::: Sabrina, who? I don't know any Sabrina.
Sabrina::: But, of course you do, Chloé. It's me.Your BFF! 
Butler Jean::: You should talk to her, Mademoiselle. She's right here.
Chloé:::I don't see anyone, she must be invisible! As far as I'm concerned, she doesn't even exist!
Ladybug::: This invisible person is obviously Sabrina.
Cat Noir::: Who's been akumatized by Hawk Moth.
Chloé::: Impossible!She's too weak to do something so bold, especially to me. You're wrong!
Ladybug::: You've been a great help to us. Thanks. 
Cat Noir::: It's not going to be easy to find someone we can't see. 
Ladybug::: So we'll just have to wait for her to find us. And we do have an advantage, she doesn't know we're onto her. 
Vanisher::: And now I do, Ladybug.
Hawk Moth:::It's time to fulfill our agreement Vanisher. Cat Noir and Ladybug are at your mercy. Take their Miraculouses and bring them back to me.
Vanisher::: They'll never see me coming, Hawk Moth. 
Cat Noir::: Huh?
Ladybug::: Huh?
Cat Noir::: Uh, the flower. It–Look out Ladybug! 
Chloé:::If it really is you Sabrina, then I want to be the one to take you down.You didn't get my costume, invisible one. Now you'll have to face me. 
Ladybug::: glitter container) How handy.
Chloé:::Looking for me Sabrina? I'm right here, come on!
Ladybug::: Oh no, seriously?You need to leave!
Chloé::: If you stop this ridiculousness right now, I might let you be my BFF again. 
Vanisher::: You've got no friends left, Chloé. And you'll never have any, EVER again.I'll make sure of that.
Chloé::: You don't scare me! Everybody loves me.
Ladybug::: This isn't a game, Chloé. 
Vanisher::: It's over, Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Not yet, Vanisher! 
Vanisher::: Just because you can see me, doesn't mean you'll defeat me Ladybug! 
Vanisher::: Look who's come to the rescue.
Ladybug:::You stay here! Don't move! 
Chloé::: Hey! This concerns me too, you know!
Ladybug:::We just have to destroy her bag and capture the akuma. 
Chloé::: Wait, Ladybug! I don't think that's where the akuma is. 
Vanisher::: So, you wanna fight after all, Chloé?
Ladybug::: Can you handle this, Cat Noir?
Cat Noir::: With pleasure my lady. 
Chloé::: But wait! The akuma has to be in the designer pin I bought her. She's wearing it on her sweater. Such an unfortunate ugly sweater. It was a gift from me.
Ladybug::: I won't tell you again Chloé, so listen up. You need to leave! You're putting yourself in great danger and us too. Got it? 
Chloé::: Why aren't you listening to me? I'm telling you, the akuma is in her pin!
Ladybug::: Oh, that's better.Your days are over akuma! Huh? 
Chloé:::I knew it! So, who was right then, huh?
Ladybug::: No more evildoing for you little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye, bye little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! 
Hawk Moth:::Inconceivable! I was so close! Urgh! 
Sabrina::: Uh, what happened? What am I doing here? Oh no! It's the brooch Chloé gave me! 
Cat Noir:::Why didn't you listen to Chloé? She was only trying to help.
Ladybug::: First, because that girl put us in danger. And second, she completely lied to us earlier. I was not gonna listen to a liar.
Chloé:::You're calling me a liar?! How dare you?! I was your hugest fan, but not anymore! You don't deserve my devotion! Ugh! 
Nadja::: Coming to you live from the hotel where Ladybug and Cat Noir have just defeated Vanisher. Here they are now.
Reporters::: Ladybug! Ladybug!
Chloé::: I'm through with you, Ladybug!
Hawk Moth:::A betrayed Ladybug worshiper? Just what I need to swiftly recover from the defeat of Vanisher. This is perfect.Fly away, my evil akuma, and evilize her!
Hawk Moth::: Antibug, I am Hawk Moth. Ladybug has let you down, I want her downfall too. So, shall we defeat Ladybug together?
Chloé::: You can count on me Hawk Moth! There will only be one heroine in Paris,me! Antibug!
Ladybug:::Cat Noir and I, we're an unstoppable team.
Antibug::: Mwah! Your time is up, Ladybug. 
Ladybug::: Excuse me, I gotta go. Bug out!
Nadja::: Thank you Ladybug. 
Antibug::: Ha ha ha ha! If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have defeated Vanisher. And now, I'm going to defeat you!
Ladybug & Cat Noir::: Chloé?
Antibug::: Wrong, super wrong. I am Antibug!
Ladybug::: We've got an emergency here. I'm about to change back.
Cat Noir::: Go ahead, I can take care of her.
Antibug::: Look at that. She's nothing without Cat Noir.
Ladybug::: We'll see each other again soon, trust me!
Cat Noir::: Looks like it's just you and me now, Antibug.
Antibug::: I love a good catfight! 
Marinette::: Oh no! I don't have any food for you Tikki!
Tikki:::Don't worry Marinette, you'll find something.
Marinette::: Uh, I'll try. 
Nadja:::Ladybug has disappeared. How is Cat Noir going to get out of this on his own?
Marinette::: Uh, this is all my fault!
Tikki::: You don't have to do everything yourself. There's no harm in listening to others from time to time.
Marinette::: You're right Tikki, but right now we have to go and help Cat Noir. We'll find you something to eat at the hotel.Ah, Cat Noir!Hurry up Tikki.
Tikki::: I'm eating as fast as I can!
Antibug::: Aren't you tired of playing second fiddle to Ladybug?
Cat Noir::: And aren't you tired of copying Ladybug?!
Hawk Moth::: Keep it up Antibug, Cat Noir is the perfect bait!
Antibug::: Team up with me, Cat Noir!
Cat Noir::: Never! Not with a fake like you. Ladybug and I are a team. Let's hope the real deal shows up soon.
Antibug::: I know you can hear me Lady-brat, wherever you are. You're going to have to choose. If you want to keep Cat Noir alive, you'll have to give me your Miraculous. And if you refuse, well then take a good look at Cat Noir, because this will be the last you'll ever see of him. I'm going to count to ten! One…!
Cat Noir::: Uh… could you make that 20?
Antibug::: Two…!
Tikki::: I need more time! Go save Cat Noir, Marinette!
Marinette::: But I can't transform!
Tikki::: You are Ladybug, with or without the costume!
Marinette::: I think I'd know if I was able to…
Antibug::: Three…!
Tikki::: I'm giving you advice, now take it! Don't make the same mistake twice!
Marinette::: Got an idea! 
Antibug::: Four…!
Ladybug:::Cat Noir and I, we're an unstoppable team.
Antibug::: Ladybug…
Cat Noir::: Ladybug. 
Ladybug:::Cat Noir and I, we're an unstoppable team.
Antibug::: So, you think you're so smart, huh? Show yourself, bug-face! 
Cat Noir::: Ready for round two? 
Marinette::: It worked!
Tikki::: I'm good to go, Marinette.
Marinette::: Yes!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Antibug::: Bad kitty! Come here to get your leash back.
Cat Noir::: Sorry, but I don't take any orders from a mere copycat. 
Ladybug::: Nice yo-yo, mine's better!
Cat Noir::: What kept you?
Ladybug::: I'm thinking the akuma's in the yo-yo.
Cat Noir::: I'm thinking it's in her earrings.
Ladybug::: Why?
Cat Noir::: She was already wearing them when she was akumatized, and her yo-yo was destroyed.
Ladybug::: Ah, pretty good advice, for a cat. 
Cat Noir::: Thanks.
Ladybug::: Lucky Charm! 
Antibug::: Anti-Charm! 
Ladybug::: A bag of marbles? What am I supposed to do with this?
Antibug::: Hahahahaha! What? You're going to defeat me with marbles? Child's play. 
Ladybug::: See that's your downfall, you're always so quick to judge.Over to you!
Cat Noir::: Got it!I'll take that. 
Antibug::: See? You're nothing without your Cat Noir!
Ladybug:::Cat Noir and I are a team. If you take me on, you take Cat Noir on too. It's not my problem if you don't have any friends. 
Hawk Moth::: Take her Miraculous before it's too late!
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm! 
Antibug::: Ah! 
Ladybug::: No more evildoing for you little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye, bye little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! 
Chloé::: What am I doing here?
Ladybug & Cat Noir::: Pound it!
Chloé::: Ladybug?
Ladybug::: Chloé, I… I'm really sorry about earlier. I would've defeated Vanisher sooner if I'd taken your advice.
Chloé::: Oh, huh. In that case, I might reconsider.
Ladybug::: Reconsider what?
Chloé::: I might just have to stay your most devoted fan after all!
Ladybug::: Oh, yeah. Uh… thanks? I suppose. In that case, let me offer you some advice. You should work things out with your friend Sabrina.
Chloé::: Mm. Well, since it's coming from Ladybug. Ha ha.
Ladybug::: Thanks for your advice Cat Noir.
Cat Noir::: 'Course. We're a team, aren't we? 
Ladybug::: Unstoppable. Bug out! 
Alya:::Hey, here's Antibug.And Vanisher? Huh, now all we need is Ladybug and Cat Noir. 
Chloé::: Well? What are you doing? Sit down. 
Marinette::: Did you see that? Chloé smiled nicely! Kinda. I think she's actually happy to have Sabrina back.
Alya::: Weirdly enough, I think the feeling is mutual. 
Chloé::: And put it on your sweater, it'll make it less horrible. 
Sabrina::: Oh, thank you Chloé!
Chloé::: Yeah, yeah. You can show me your gratitude later, class is starting. 
Marinette::: I think they'll always be BFFs. In their own way.
Alya::: I still prefer our way, though.
