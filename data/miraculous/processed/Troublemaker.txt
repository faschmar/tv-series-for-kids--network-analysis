Penny::: Mr. Stone would like his breakfast brought to him on the back of a polar bear. Could you arrange that for me, please?
Jagged:::Fetch!
Butler Jean::: Uh...I'll see what I can do, Miss Penny. Will zat be all?
Penny:::Yes, a red-eye flight would be preferable. Jagged's crocodile, Fang, hates flying in the daytime.
Bob::: Penny, I found the perfect way to market his new album! He's gonna be a guest on a reality TV show!
Penny:::I really don't think Jagged will be okay with it.No! No, I wasn't talking to you. Confirm that flight.Thanks a lot.Uh, I'll call you back.Bob, wait!
Jagged::: Penny, did you remember to order those macaroons for Fang?
Penny::: Of course; I'm taking care of that right now, Jagged. 
Bob:::Your album's gonna go platinum and wait 'til you find out how!
Mayor Bourgeois::: I'm sorry, Miss Penny, but you cannot allow your crocodile to just roam around the hotel by itself.
Penny:::I'm sorry, Mr. Bourgeois.Yes, what— 
Jagged:::What?! What is this trash?
Penny::: Thanks, Mr. Mayor. 
Jagged:::You want me to be a guest on Rocker Wants a Wife?!There's nothing rock 'n' roll about that show. My fans will never watch it!
Bob::: Of course they will, Jagged! This is how marketing works these days.
Jagged::: No way! I'm a genuine rock and roller, Bob!
Butler Jean:::I am so sorry, Miss. There were no polar bears available. Would a pony do instead?
Jagged::: A real artist, with real talent! I can dig being a guest on a reality show, but it's gotta be music to my ears, you know? Quality!
Penny:::A pony is fine. Uh, can you throw an assortment of macaroons in too, please? Thanks.No, not you. Don't worry; there won't be any ponies, just a crocodile. 
Bob::: Deal with it, Jagged! You will be a guest on that show, whether you like it or not!
Jagged::: Oh yeah? And how're you gonna make me do that?
Penny:::I'll call you back. 
Jagged::: I think we're done here, Bob.Of course! Now that's what I call a rock 'n' roll idea. Penny, you're the best! What would I do without you? 
Alec:::Welcome to Fill My Shoes! You're joining us live in a new episode, and our guest today is the one and only Jagged!
Jagged:::Rock and Roll, yeah! 
Alec::: Filling the shoes of...a baker!
Jagged::: Yo, Rockers!
Alec::: And a big thanks to Tom Dupain for having us here in his bakery, the best in Paris, I might add. 
Tom:::Uhh...hello!
Sabine::: Excuse me, would you like some hot croissants?
Sabine::: I'm not sure it was such a good idea to let them film the show here, sweetie.
Marinette::: Of course it was, Mom. Jagged asked specifically to come here! You realize how good this is gonna be for the bakery? And Dad's gonna become an instant celebrity!
Sabine::: Well, for a celebrity, he looks pretty nervous.
Tom::: No, no! You have the right energy, Jagged.You just need to be gentle.Haha, hi!More like this.
Penny::: Calm down, Fang.
Marinette::: Are you okay, Miss Penny?
Penny::: Yes, yes, it's just, this show was my idea, and Jagged's putting all his trust in me and I just hope everything goes well today.
Alec::: So Jagged, how does it feel to fill the baker's shoes today?
Jagged::: It's awesome! Check out this edible guitar I made from scratch. This is so rock 'n' roll!Flour, eggs and butter! 
Sabine::: So, Miss Penny, what's it like working with a star like Jagged? He seems so cool!
Penny::: Oh yes, he's...wonderful—Uh, I mean...yeah, he’s awesome.
Tom and Jagged:::Flour, eggs and butter! And fire in the oven... 
Plagg:::Oh, come on! Are you going to finally put cheese on that bread or what? Since when do you have any interest in this show?
Adrien::: The show's being shot at Marinette's.
Tom and Jagged:::This is the baker's rock 'n' roll! 
Jagged::: Yo, Marinette! My favorite little lady, come over and rock out with us!
Plagg::: Mmm-hmmm-mmm-hmmm!
Jagged::: It's so cool that we get to spend the day together. Marinette's really talented, Alec; she did the artwork for my latest album, and she's only in high school!
Alec::: Wow, impressive!A true family of artists. A talented young designer and a gifted patissier. By the way, what're you gonna bake for us today, Tom?
Tom::: Uh...how about some chocolate croissants?Can you grab a bag of flour please, dear?
Marinette::: Sure, Dad! Ah!Uh oh.
Jagged::: Hey, look! I look like a ghost! Rock and Boo-Hoo! 
Alec::: Making pastries is obviously no piece of cake! Stay tuned; we'll be right back after this commercial break!
Jagged:::Oooh!
Cameraman::: And cut!
Alec::: Hi, Bob! 
Bob::: Alec!This is starting out very well.
Marinette::: Sorry, Jagged!
Jagged::: No sweat, Marinette.
Penny:::Could you tell me where the restroom is, please?
Marinette:::Upstairs!
Penny::: Thanks. 
Tom:::Come on. We have some cleaning up to do. 
Penny::: Are you sure it's up here?
Jagged::: She said upstairs.
Penny::: Wait. This isn't the restroom.
Jagged::: This must be Marinette's bedroom. Cool. Hey, there's a sink! 
Bob::: Our ratings are sky-high!
Cameraman::: Alec, we're back in thirty seconds!
Alec::: Where's Jagged?
Marinette::: In the restroom upstairs.
Alec::: Thanks.Follow me; we'll improvise.
Jagged:::Hey, look! Man, Marinette's got some serious talent.Hey!I know this guy. Rock on, Jagged!
Penny::: We've got to hurry, Jagged.
Jagged:::Yeah, yeah. Relax, Penny. 
Cameraman::: He's here! Come one, start shooting. In three, two, one.
Alec:::And we're back on the air with Jagged filling the shoes of a baker. Let's see how this rockstar cleans off all that flour. 
Jagged::: Hey, there are more photos of this dude than of me! I think the baker's daughter's got a little crush. 
Plagg::: Looky there. Another secret admirer.
Jagged:::Aw, teenage love is so sweet! Makes me wanna write a song.
Marinette:::No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
Sabine::: Marinette?
Marinette::: no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Tikki::: Keep calm, Marinette; it's not a big deal.
Marinette::: Of course it is! This is a major disaster! I told everyone in school to watch today's show, including Adrien! He's gonna see all those photos and figure out I'm in love with him! 
Tikki::: But isn't that what you want?
Marinette::: No! Not like this! 
Marinette:::What're you guys doing in here?!
Penny::: I'm sorry, Marinette; I couldn't find the restroom.
Jagged::: Hey Marinette, you want me to sign this poster of me? 
Marinette:::No! I just need everyone to leave!And you, stop filming!Penny, do something!
Penny:::You heard the lady.
Female commercial voice:::Security and comfort... 
Cameraman::: Hey Penny, you just cut us off the air!
Penny:::Sorry! 
Marinette::: No, Penny, get them out of here first, please!
Alec::: Penny, give me that cable! We're live!
Jagged:::Choo! Penny, was that flour organic? You know I'm allergic to the non-organic flour.
Alec::: Penny, the cable!
Bob::: Penny, do you realize we've got no picture?
Jagged::: Penny, do you have a tissue? Ah-ah-ah-choo!
Marinette::: Penny, no! Get out of my room first!
Bob::: Penny, what is going on?
Jagged::: Penny, you said this gig would be easy as pie!
Penny:::STOP!! That's enough!! All of you, back downstairs, now! Out, out, out!! 
Jagged::: Hey! 
Penny::: Out, out, out!!
Bob::: What do we do now?
Penny:::I'll meet you downstairs in five!
Bob::: But Penny...!
Penny:::In! Five! 
Hawk Moth::: A devoted assistant losing her cool. Such a fortunate opportunity!Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her! 
Hawk Moth:::Troublemaker, I am Hawk Moth. You've always been the faithful one, taking care of other people and solving all their problems. Today you are free of that burden. From now on, you shall be the creator of all their problems.
Penny::: Sounds like a plan, Hawk Moth. 
Troublemaker::: So, what's next on my to-do list? Oh, I know; taking care of Jagged!
Marinette:::I'll be a laughingstock at school, online, all over town! And worst of all, Adrien will never talk to me again! This is a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a dis... 
Tikki::: Just breathe! Everything's gonna be okay!
Marinette::: It is?
Tikki::: Well yeah! Besides, it's too late anyway. The show's live!
Marinette::: OH NO! This is a disaster......a disaster, a disaster, a disaster...!
Tikki::: Oh, Marinette.
Bob::: All right, everyone back to work. Chop chop!
Alec::: Okay, people; Jagged, Mr. Dupain, get back to your place. We're live in five, four, three—
Tom:::Wait, wait, wait! We'd rather not continue.
Bob::: What?! Have you lost your mind?!
Sabine::: We're not comfortable with your cameras going everywhere and invading our privacy! Our daughter is upset because of your show. We won't allow that!
Bob::: The ratings are sky-high. There's no way we stop the show now, right, Jagged?
Bob:::Aha! See?
Sabine:::Oh! How dare you?!
Sabine::: I demand an apology!
Tom:::Darling! What happened?
Bob:::Hey! Are you looking for trouble?!
Tom:::I could pretend that this isn't bothering me, but now you've gone too far, mister!
Marinette::: Dad?
Sabine:::Don't even think about laying a finger on my husband!
Alec:::Huh?
Jagged:::Oh! What's happening? A ghost! It's a ghost! Where's Penny?! Penny!
Bob:::Sure your bakery ain't built on an ancient cemetery?
Troublemaker::: Hello, Jagged.
Jagged::: Whoa! Who are you?! Where's Penny?! Penny!!
Troublemaker:::There's no more Penny to deal with all your problems, Jagged! From now on, there's only Troublemaker!And I'll make your life nothing but problems! 
Marinette::: Penny?
Tikki::: That poor Penny was trying so hard to help everyone that she became a perfect victim for Hawk Moth!
Marinette::: Shooting the show here definitely wasn't a good idea!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Yeah!
Adrien::: It's time for Cat Noir to cook up a plan at the bakery!
Plagg::: Don't forget to save a baguette for me. I just love Camembert on sourdough!
Adrien::: You're just a floating stomach!
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Troublemaker::: Here comes trouble again, Jagged! 
Tom::: Not in my bakery! 
Jagged::: Penny, stop! It's—It's not—ah-choo!—rock and roll!
Troublemaker::: I hate rock and roll, Jagged! I only love chaos, and you'll be my number one hit!
Alec:::You're witnessing the arrival of a new supervillain, live—aah!
Troublemaker:::Show's over, people! 
Nadja::: I'm in front of Dupain-Cheng Bakery, where a new villain just appeared!
Cat Noir::: Hey everyone, let me take care of this. It'll be a piece of cake! 
Cat Noir::: Catacly—!
Troublemaker:::So you wanna play rescue? No one's gonna be rescued today!
Ladybug::: Right on time, Cat Noir.
Cat Noir:::Good to see you, Bugaboo. Looks like we're gonna break bread today, huh?
Ladybug::: Stop calling me Bugaboo!Follow me!
Cat Noir::: Oh wow! That's a lot of pictures!
Ladybug:::We can take the grand tour later, Cat Noir.
Ladybug:::Sorry!
Ladybug:::I said later, Cat Noir!
Cat Noir::: Look out!
Ladybug::: The akuma's inside the pen!
Troublemaker::: Touch me if you dare! 
Cat Noir::: What're we gonna do? I can't touch her with a ten-foot pole even if I wanted to!
Ladybug::: Her strength is also her weakness. In order to touch us, she must become touchable herself!
Cat Noir::: Oh, uh, there you are.All right!
Ladybug::: Be careful! She's probably hiding somewhere in this room! If she wants to take our Miraculous, she can't be untouchable.
Cat Noir::: And if we can grab her, we can also grab her pen.
Ladybug::: And capture the akuma! But we'll have to act fast!
Troublemaker:::You've already lost half the battle, Ladybug!
Ladybug::: No! 
Hawk Moth:::Excellent, Troublemaker!
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm!
Troublemaker:::I had it!
Cat Noir:::That was a close call. Certainly not how I dreamed we'd share our secret identity. Oh no, not like that!
Ladybug::: It'll have to wait, at least until we kick Trouble's butt and Hawk Moth! broken plate) A broken plate?That's strange; I don't see how to use it!
Cat Noir::: Maybe losing an earring weakened your power.
Ladybug:::My power has to be working!It is working!Sticking time!
Cat Noir:::Seriously?
Cat Noir:::All right! We're comin' to get you!
Ladybug:::Be careful, Cat Noir! She could come from anywhere to get my Miraculous!
Cat Noir:::She's nowhere to be seen. I'll check on the roof. Stay here! 
Ladybug:::No! Don't leave me here alone! I only have a plate to defend myself! 
Ladybug::: Stop!
Hawk Moth:::Bravo, Troublemaker! Take her Miraculous!
Troublemaker:::What?!
Ladybug:::Having some trouble?
Cat Noir:::Aw, my poor Bugaboo! Another supervillain fan has literally glued themselves to you.Sorry to disappoint, but I'm the only one to stick to M'Lady! 
Troublemaker::: 
Penny::: No! 
Ladybug::: No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly.Miraculous Ladybug!
Penny:::Wha...? What happened? Where's Jagged?
Ladybug:::You're always so helpful, putting everyone before you.Let's worry about Penny for a change. How are you feeling?
Penny:::I'm fine. Thank you, Ladybug.
Ladybug::: Whoops! Gotta go! Rock and roll! 
Cat Noir::: Rock and roll! 
Ladybug::: Whew! Well, that was a close call! Looks like you won't find out my true identity today!
Cat Noir:::I already know who you are.
Ladybug:::Huh?!
Cat Noir:::You're the girl of my dreams. 
Ladybug:::Silly kitty!
Ladybug & Cat Noir:::Pound it!
Marinette:::Mom! Dad!
Sabine::: Marinette!
Tom::: Are you okay?
Marinette::: I'm fine! I locked myself in the bathroom.
Bob::: Penny!
Penny:::Hi, everyone!
Jagged:::Penny!Oh, Penny!I'm so glad to see you again without your supervillain costume! What would I do without you? You're the best! 
Sabine:::Have a nice day, sweetie!
Marinette:::Bye, Mom!Hanh!
Tikki:::Are you okay, Marinette?
Marinette::: I will never persuade my parents to shoot a TV show at our house again!
Tikki::: Not unless you want the whole world to know all your secrets!
Marinette::: I just need to stay on the down-low for a few days so everyone can forget all about what happened — especially Adrien!Mmnh! 
Marinette:::Phew! Hopefully, he didn't see me!
Adrien::: Hey, Marinette!How's it going? After what happened at your place last night, I was worried that—
Marinette:::Oh, so you watched the show, then!Well, uh, look...about what you saw on the show last night — the totographs, in my room—
Adrien::: You mean the photographs?
Marinette:::The grotographs, exactly!It-it's not what you think.See...I'm really into fashion, and, umm...
Adrien:::Are you lying?
Marinette::: No! I'm so not into you—I mean, sure, I'm interested in you, but, um, not in that way; well, you know, ha-ha-ha-ha...ha ha!
Adrien:::Just teasing.I understand; don't worry. I've got used to having lots of fans...and, photographs of me everywhere — even in the most unlikely places.
Marinette:::As if someone would have a picture of you under her bed, right?
Adrien:::Yeah. I was wondering; since you're into fashion so much, you could come watch my next photo shoot!
Marinette::: No way! For you?—peal—meal— For real?
Adrien::: Honestly, it's pretty long and boring, but if you were there, it would definitely be more fun! Whaddaya say?
Marinette:::Oh wow! Yes!Thank you, Adrien.
Adrien::: I'll keep you posted, then.See you later in class.I'm glad to have you as one of my fans. 
Tikki:::Relax, Marinette. You can breathe now!
Marinette:::He invited me to one of his photo shoots! 
Tikki:::Yeah, that's awesome! And, you even managed to get some normal sentences out, too!
Marinette::: Oh, come on! That's not funny!
Tikki::: You're totally right. It is not funny.
