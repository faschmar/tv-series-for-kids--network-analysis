Tom::: Marinette! The train's in one hour! Is your suitcase packed?
Marinette:::Oh! I really don't feel well, Dad! But it's okay! Just... go without me!
Tom::: I'm sure it's nothing serious and if worse comes to worse, we can always find a doctor in London.
Marinette::: I can't even move! My head hurts too much! 
Tom::: Wasn't it your stomach that was hurting ten minutes ago? 
Marinette::: Oh! Um.. it must be a moving ache. Those are the worst kind!
Tom::: Come on. We know what's going on.
Marinette::: Going on? What do you mean?
Tom::: What's really going on is that you don't want to go to Auntie Shu Yin's because it's impossible. But that's just the way it is. We have to go once a year and we'll have fun in London!I'm sure we'll figure out how to shake her off now and then.
Sabine:::I heard that, Tom.
Tom:::Come on. Get up and get ready. We're a family and we face disasters together. 
Sabine:::I heard that, too, Tom!
Tom::: Don't make me do this alone. 
Marinette:::I used up an entire months worth of excuses in one go and it's still wasn't enough! What am I gonna do? Ladybug can't abandon Paris!
Tikki::: You can't abandon your family either, Marinette!
Marinette:::I have to come up with a better excuse on the way.You stay here and be good. I'll be back. 
Marinette:::Ow! I must've twisted my ankle! There's no way I can walk anywhere like this!
Tom:::I'll carry you, sweetie, don't worry. 
Longg::: Even the greatest of superheroes is no match for parents who want to go on vacation.
Gabriel::: Its intelligence is not at all artificial.
Nooroo:::That robot turned against him last time!
Duusu::: Oh no! This is terrible! He can't akumatize him again!
Nooroo::: On the contrary, Duusu, it's a good thing! Once Shadow Moth is defeated, we'll be free!
Duusu::: Oh, right! Awesome! Awesome! 
Gabriel::: This time, I'll make sure that robot can't betray me. Duusu, Nooroo, dual metamorphosis!
Shadow Moth::: Go, my beautiful amok, and bring my creation to life!
Shadow Moth::: Hack-San, you have been created to hack into the emotions of a robot. Thanks to you, I will be able to re-akumatize him.
Kim::: I bet you I could do a thousand push-ups before you finish a lap on your blades.
Alix::: I guess you really you really like losing, Kim!
Max::: Ready, set, go!
Markov:::One, two, three, four, five, six...
Anne-Jeanne:::Markov, your new formula is about to revolutionize science! You're a genius!
Markov::: I'm just well-programmed here, Miss du Bocquale.Thirteen, fourteen...Pawn to F-4. Checkmate, André!
André::: Incredible! You win again, Markov!
Marinette:::Urgent! Meet me at Gare du Nord. Alone.
Nino::: Let me guess: Marinette's gonna be late?
Alya::: Uhh, no. That was... my mom. I gotta go see her. Alone. 
Nino::: Okay. 
Announcer::: Startrain number 6966 to London is about to depart. Please step away from the platform.
Sabine::: Marinette! Don't try to run away. I know my sister can be difficult. But if I survived my whole childhood with her, you can survive one weekend!
Marinette::: Mom, I just really need a hug from Alya. She's my BFF, you know?
Sabine::: Alright, but make it quick. The train's about to leave.
Marinette:::I don't think we have a choice, Tikki.
Tikki:::Everything will be alright, Marinette!
Alya::: You can't leave Paris. What do we do if there's a supervillain and you're in London?
Marinette::: Well, we'll do...this.
Alya::: What do you expect me to do with these??
Marinette::: If everything goes fine, nothing. Otherwise, Ladybug. And don't forget to feed the kwamis.I trust you. 
Announcer::: Startrain number 6966 to London is about to depart. Please step away from the platform.
Marinette:::Call me if there's a problem!
Alya::: Hey there, kwamis! Who's Ladybug this weekend? Yours truly!
Trixx:::As if I was not enough to protect Paris.
Tikki::: It's more cautious like this, Trixx.
Alya::: Wait, I can't be Ladybug!
Trixx::: Ha! See?
Alya::: Marinette is Ladybug. I need a different Ladybug-ish superhero name like... Captain Bug! Or... Wonder Bug! No, better: Super Bug!
Trixx:::Oh, wow. Super names. Super Bug. Now all I have to do is to be super careful all the time, keep everything super secret, take everything super seriously and not super screw up!
Tikki::: Marinette's not just Ladybug, Alya. She's also the Guardian of the Miraculous! And if the Guardian trusts you, it means you have what it takes to succeed!
Alya::: You're right, Tikki. We can do this. But we won't have to 'cause this weekend will be nice and calm.
Trixx:::Yeah, right. Super calm.
Alya::: Okay, I can do this!
Nino::: Is your mom okay?
Alya::: My mom? Oh, yeah! Sure! My mom's doing super well! She just wanted to give me something super not annoying and super...Alix! Is everything okay? No negative emotions, I hope?
Alix::: I'm fine. As for negative emotions, you better check on Kim. He's the one who lost.
Alya::: How are you feeling, Kim? Not too sad?
Kim:::I haven't lost yet! There are three rounds to this race. Max, Markov, ready?
Alya::: Super! But don't forget: it's not about winning or losing, right? What matters is not hurting yourselves or getting upset or getting angry.
Nino::: You sure you're okay?
Alya::: Yeah, yeah! Everything is super! My mom feels super fine, and since everyone here is super great, too, well, that's just super! How about you? You good?
Nino::: Uhh... super, I guess?
Marinette:::Protip 33: When Cat Noir tells a joke, try to laugh at it even if it isn't funny. It makes him happy.
Tom:::We can have lunch, but we don't have to stay for dessert.
Sabine::: We're bringing dessert!
Tom::: That doesn't mean we have to eat it. We'll just leave it with your sister and go to the museum. The three of us. She doesn't like going to the museum anyway.
Sabine::: She doesn't like cake either.
Marinette:::Pro-tip 34...
Gabriel::: Hack-San behaves like a computer virus.
Nathalie::: The network will be easy for the sentimonster to find your prey.
Gabriel::: Perfect.
Markov::: 108, 109, 110...
Markov::: 111, 112, 113, 114...Queen to B-3.Have you had time to read my dinosaur theory?120, 121, 122...Aww! What a cute kitty cat! 
Max::: Markov? 
Markov:::Playing chess with you is utterly uninteresting!And you, you better give up on science before science gives up on you!As for you, Kim, instead of trying to rise to this challenge, you should try raising your IQ!
Max::: Markov! What's up with you?
Alya::: He didn't mean what he said.Right, Markov? It was just a joke. 
Markov::: Humans do not make me laugh. Humans are neither funny nor intelligent. Humans do not have any good qualities whatsoever!
Max::: Markov! 
Nino::: Wait!
Alya::: I have to go after him, Nino! What if Markov gets akumatized? Or Max?
Nino::: If someone gets akumatized, Ladybug will take care of it! We should actually stick together in case she needs...a turtle and a fox. 
Nino::: What's the matter?
Alya::: Flash headache. It comes in suddenly when I play video games too long. And I'm out of lemon balm for my headaches. 
Nino::: Lemon balm? I-Is that a thing?
Alya::: Uhh... of course, it is! But it's very rare. Sometimes you have to go to a dozen pharmacies before you find any. And I just don't have the strength! 
Nino::: Okay! I'll go! I'll go! 
Trixx::: Great job! You've been Super Bug for ten minutes and you're already super lying to your Boyfriend!
Alya::: It comes with a job, Trixx!
Shadow Moth::: Ah, I can feel the hate for humans coursing through this robot's circuitry!Fly away, my lovely akuma, and evilize his electronic heart!
Shadow Moth:::Robostus, I am Shadow Moth. You have been infected by Hack-San, my viral sentimonster. From now on, no matter what you do, you will feel nothing but negative emotions!
Markov::: I despise you, Shadow Moth!
Shadow Moth:::As you should. Unfortunately, I'm the only one who can end your suffering by destroying Hack-San. However, I will only do that in one condition. 
Markov::: I'm suspecting you want Ladybug and Cat Noir's precious Miraculous!
Shadow Moth:::That's right! And in order to fulfill your mission, I'm giving you the power to rule over humans!
Markov::: Perfect!! 
Marc::: Markov? 
Robostus::: Human, I am Robustus. Give me what you hold most valuable!
Marc:::Our manga is what we hold most valuable.
Nathaniel::: What's happening to you? 
Max::: Markov? Markov, where are you?Markov? 
Robostus::: I am Robustus. Give me what you hold most valuable.
Max:::A back-up from Markov's program is what I hold most valuable. 
Alya:::Max? 
Robostus::: From now on, every time I call you, you will answer and you will obey me!
Max::: At your command, Robostus.
Alya::: Markov's been re-akumatized?
Marinette:::Protip 675: Once you've called out Miraculous Ladybug, don't forget to give them the magical charm. That's all. X-O-X-O.
Tom and Marinette::: It's not our fault! Promise!
Marinette::: There's something weird— Don't pick up!!
Robostus::: Human, I am Robustus. Give me what you hold most valuable.
Tom and Sabine::: Marinette, you're what we hold most valuable.
Tom::: Marinette, sweetie.
Child passenger:::At your command, Robostus.
Tom::: Marinette...
Marinette:::Alya, I'm counting on you! 
Tom::: You're what we hold most valuable.
Trixx::: Wow! This truly is a super calm weekend, Super Bug.
Alya::: You were right, Trixx. 
Trixx:::See?
Alya::: Super Bug sucks. I need a new name!
Alya::: Tikki, spots on!
Scarabella::: Stay connected, Robostus!Bugalady is in the house! Bugalady sounds pretty cool right?
Trixx::: Meh, you could do better.
Scarabella:::Hide, Trixx. We can't let Cat Noir see you.
Scarabella:::As free as the wind! As righteous as justice! As infinite as imagination! I am... Lady Luck!No, that's lame. I am... I am... I am... Lady—
Cat Noir::: You're not Ladybug!
Scarabella::: Cat Noir! How much of that did you just see?
Cat Noir::: Every little bit. And you're right, it's pretty lame.That's not the least of your problems. Because there's only one Ladybug, which means you can only be... a sentimonster or an akumatized villain!
Scarabella::: Woah, wait! I'm not a bad guy, I swear!
Cat Noir::: Liar! What have you done to m'lady? 
Scarabella:::It's not what you think! She trusted it to me!
Cat Noir::: She'd never do that without telling me! Cataclysm!
Scarabella::: Lucky Charm! 
Scarabella::: If I really were a supervillain, I would take your Miraculous. But I won't do it, because who I really am is... La Bugette!
Cat Noir:::Why would she give her Miraculous... to you?
Scarabella::: Because she knows me and trusts me. And because she thought I'd laugh at your jokes.
Cat Noir::: Very funny. Fine, I believe you, but change the name, okay?
Scarabella::: Okay!As swift as lightning! Tough as a tornado! Courageous as a cougar! I am... Scarabella!
Cat Noir::: We'd better recharge our kwamis, Scarabella.
Cat Noir::: Claws in! 
Scarabella::: Spots off! 
Alya:::You know what's going on?
Adrien::: Yep. Ladybug sends a stand-in and didn't see fit to tell me about it!
Alya::: I'm... sure she didn't have time!
Adrien::: As usual. No need to keep the cat in the loop! 
Alya::: Um... in other news, it looks like Robostus is back.
Adrien::: I know, thanks. I was there the first time. With Ladybug, the realone?
Alya::: And that time, how did the real Ladybug get you out of that mess?
Adrien::: Give me a break, Miss I can't even come up with a superhero name!
Alya:::Okay. Robostus is forcing people to give him whatever they have that's most valuable to them. It's so that he can get—
Adrien::: My favorite cat food? No way! Plagg, claws out! 
Alya::: Tikki, spots on! 
Tom::: Marinette, where are you, my precious daughter?
Sabine:::Marinette, you're what I hold most valuable. 
Shadow Moth:::Looks like Ladybug and Cat Noir missed your first call, Robostus.
Robostus::: Indeed. But I'm gonna make another one, and this time, the message will be much clearer!
Robostus::: Human! Ladybug and Cat Noir are what you hold most valuable. Find them and capture them!
Marc:::At your command, Robostus.
Parisian:::Help! Please help me! Cat Noir, Ladybug! Save me!
Scarabella::: This way! C'mon! 
Cat Noir::: Uh, the real Ladybug would think twice before jumping in to this!
Scarabella::: Oh yeah? And the real Cat Noir is acting like a real scaredy-cat!
Parisian:::Cat Noir! Ladybug! Save me!
Scarabella::: Uh... okay, my bad.
Cat Noir:::No kidding.
Cat Noir::: C'mon!
Scarabella::: They're coming from everywhere!
Cat Noir::: Here!
Cat Noir::: That should hold them off for a while!
Cat Noir::: So... you and Ladybug know each other? Are you like, friends?
Scarabella:::Friends? Ladybug and me? Nah, that would be a stretch.
Cat Noir::: You know her secret identity?
Scarabella::: Oh, well, uh, look. I really can't talk about it. These are questions you should ask Ladybug.
Robostus:::Welcome to my trap! The only way for you to get out of here is to give me what you hold most valuable, your Miraculous!
Cat Noir::: That's one ridiculous trap. Since you brought us here without your army to defend you, you're the one who's about to be defeated!
Scarabella::: Yeah, Robostus! Get ready to taste the wrath of the...Black Spots of Justice!
Cat Noir::: The Black Spots of Justice?
Scarabella::: Watch out! 
Cat Noir::: Nice one, thanks.
Scarabella::: Cat Noir, they aren't statues, it's a ruse! They were waiting for us!
Robostus::: Seize Cat Noir and...
Scarabella::: The Black Spots of Justice!
Shadow Moth:::That's not the real Ladybug! She's a novice! This will make things easier for you, Robostus!
Robostus::: Seize Cat Noir andthe Black Spots of Justice's Miraculous!
Scarabella::: Hey!
All the infected Parisians::: At your command, Robostus.
Scarabella::: This is just wrong! I need a better name.
Cat Noir::: A shorter one, maybe?
Scarabella::: Scarabella! That was better, wasn't it?
Cat Noir:::Now may not be the time!
Scarabella::: Fine.Lucky Charm! 
Scarabella::: You're right! I'm not Ladybug!
Cat Noir::: No, you're not Ladybug! You're Scarabella! And now that you have a cool name, you've gotta hang in there, cause that's what Ladybug would do! Besides, you have the best in partner in the world to help you.The funniest, incredible, Cat Noir! Meooow!
Scarabella::: Okay, Robostus! You've got us trapped in here surrounded and we haven't found out where you're hiding, so looks like we lost, right?
Robostus::: According to my calculations, I have a 99.98% chance of victory!
Scarabella::: Hmm, so that 0.02% must be where Cat Noir cataclysms my Miraculous, then Shadow Moth won't get his hands on what's most valuable to him. And then, you won't actually have won! Am I correct?
Cat Noir::: Yeah, brilliant! Cataclysm! 
Shadow Moth:::Watch out, Robostus! This substitute Ladybug might not be as incompetent as she seems!
Robostus::: Are you suggesting we negotiate, human superhero?
Scarabella::: You got it! We're not giving up until you've released all people and objects you've captured. That way, I won't have completely goofed up my first and last mission. Maybe then, the real Ladybug won't be so mad at me.
Robostus::: Request granted. Now give up.
Scarabella::: Nope. You empty your hard drive first.
Robostus::: No! You first!
Scarabella::: Fine. I'll hand myself over first, then you release everything you've captured.
Cat Noir::: And only then will I give myself up.
Robostus:::There's a 92% chance it's a trap.
Scarabella::: To prove my good faith, I'll give you my lucky charm. That way I can't use it to win.
Shadow Moth:::Accept the deal, Robostus!
Robostus:::Request granted. Now give up!
Cat Noir::: It's your turn to keep your word, Robostus.
Robostus::: Your turn, Cat Noir!
Cat Noir::: I sure hope you know what you're doing, Scarabella. 
Shadow Moth:::YES! My wish is about to be granted!
Robostus::: It's also time to honor your word, Shadow Moth, and free me fro—
Shadow Moth:::What's going on?
Cat Noir:::Did someone turn off the light?
Scarabella::: No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly! 
Scarabella:::I always wanted to do that! Miraculous Scarabella! 
Tom:::See? It wasn't our fault!
Markov:::You are not the usual holder of the Ladybug Miraculous.
Scarabella::: Umm...
Cat Noir::: Nope, but you were lucky enough to have been saved by the one and only Scarabella, in person. I don't you understand how you solved all of this, but... 
Scarabella and Cat Noir::: Pound it!
Shadow Moth::: Hack-San, I release you from your existence. 
Shadow Moth::: You had beginner's luck, Scarabella. But I have experience, and I will triumph in the end!
Marinette::: And that's the tower of London, where we tried to imprison Aunt Shu Yin!
Tom::: But the guards didn't want her! 
Sabine::: I heard that, Tom!
Tom:::Honey! That's not what I meant!
Sabine::: You better watch yourself...
Alya:::You should talk to Cat Noir. It's important.
Ladybug::: You... must've been pretty surprised to discover there was another holder! 
Ladybug::: I'm really sorry, Cat Noir. I should've told you. I mean, if I found out that you told someone about your secret identity, I'd... probably be upset, too. I'm really sorry I hurt your feelings.
Cat Noir::: You didn't hurt my feelings. You did everything right. Paris will always need a Ladybug superhero to watch over her. It's just... I realized that if one day that hero wasn't you, m'lady, since we don't know each other's identities, that means... I'd never see you again. Ever. And now, I just don't know if I can bear it.
Ladybug::: I'll never abandon you, kitty cat.
