Adrien::: Father, there's something I'd like to talk to you...about. Can I have a few minutes of your time?
Gabriel::: Yes, of course.
Adrien::: Really?
Gabriel::: I'll tell Nathalie to let you know as soon as I'm available.
Adrien:::It'll be too late then.
Gabriel::: Shouldn't you be practicing your piano?
Adrien::: Yes.
Gabriel::: That's impossible!
Gabriel::: Nathalie!Where is my son?!
Nathalie::: Huh?!
Gabriel::: Adrien has managed to leave his room without either of you noticing! Find him!
Commercial voice::: Radiant. Carefree. Dreamy. Adrien... the fragrance. 
Marinette:::Adrien. 
Wayhem::: Adrien?! The Adrien Agreste?! This is awesome!
Adrien:::Okay, bye. 
Wayhem::: The first time I saw you in that ad, I told myself, Wayhem, I got to meet this guy. He's so cool!. What if I was, like, your biggest fan?
Adrien::: Yeah... sure.
Wayhem:::Say cheese!Me-and-Adrien. This-is-the-best-day-of-my-life!
Adrien::: No! Don't post it up on......the Internet.
GPS voice::: You have got one new alert!
GPS voice::: New destination.
Wayhem::: Hold up! Could you autograph my cologne bottle of Adrien?And my life-size cutout?
Adrien:::Some other time. I've gotta get going. 
Wayhem::: No wait! Adrien!
Girl::: It's Adrien from TV!
Firefighter::: Can I have an autograph for my daughter?
Wayhem::: Adrien? Adrien! Adrien!!
Commercial voice and Marinette::: Radiant. Carefree. Dreamy. Adrien.
Alya::: Marinette, I've been waiting for you for fifteen minutes! Where are you, girl?
Marinette::: Uh, I was deciding which swimsuit to wear. 
Commercial voice::: Radiant. Carefree. Dreamy.
Alya::: Uh-huh. And the Adrien's ad helps you pick out a swimsuit, girl?
Commercial voice::: Adrien.
Marinette:::Um, yeah! I'll be right there! 
Tikki::: Marinette?
Tikki::: Marinette, haven't you forgotten something?
Marinette:::Oh! I forgot to pack my swimsuit!
Tikki:::Mmm-mmm.Hmm?
Marinette::: I have to change! 
Adrien::: Marinette?
Marinette::: Adrien?
Adrien::: You live near here. Can I hide out at your place?
Marinette::: Uh, at my place? You, hide out? What's going on?
Adrien's fans::: Adrien!
Adrien::: Too late!
Wayhem::: Adrien!There he is!
Marinette:::Come with me!
Wayhem::: Adrien!
Adrien::: Thank you for saving me. People are going crazy over this ad.
Marinette::: You starred in an ad? I had no idea!That's awesome!
Adrien::: I don't know about that. In fact it's really quite......embarrassing?
Marinette::: Heh! All good now! I'd better get going.Isn't that your bodyguard?
Adrien::: Actually I-I snuck out without permission. I'm supposed to be home right now and—
Jean Tretiens::: Adrien and his girlfriend in the fountain!
Gabriel::: Adrien?
Wayhem::: In the fountain?!
Alya::: With Marinette?
GPS voice::: You have got one new alert!
Adrien:::I'm so sorry I got you in this crazy mess, Marinette. Plus, now everyone thinks you're my girlfriend!
Marinette:::Oh, that's terrible, yeah.I mean no! I mean it's not that terrible, really. Is it? Or...not? Anyway, do you think it's gonna be okay between you and your father?
Adrien::: How can anything bad happen... with my Marinette lucky charm? 
Woman:::It's Adrien from the ad! There he is!
Adrien's fans:::Adrien! Adrien! Wow!
Rose::: Aww! They look so cute together!
Adrien::: We can't stay here!
Wayhem::: Yoohoo! Adrien!
Wayhem::: Adrien!Look, that's Adrien's bodyguard! 
Fan::: Look at him!
Wayhem::: I got his phone!
Fans::: There he is! Oh my goodness!
Wayhem:::Adrien?!
Gabriel:::Who are you? And where's my son? Return that phone this minute or I'll have you arrested!
Jean Duparc::: They got off the train at Concorde!
Nooroo::: Master, you don't really think Adrien could be Cat Noir?
Gabriel::: I don't know. But he's hiding something for sure. Since his bodyguard has failed to keep an eye on Adrien, there's only one way for us to uncover his secret.
Gabriel::: Nooroo, dark wings rise!
Roger::: Is this your vehicle? What kind of parking job is this in the middle of Paris? You think you own the streets?
Roger::: All right, take it away!
Roger::: And assaulting a police officer on duty. This is not looking good for you!Hmm?What do you think you're doing? Don't pick up! 
Automated voice::: You have one new message.
Roger::: I'm talking to you!All right, you asked for it!
Gabriel:::What have you done? Where's Adrien? Don't tell me it's that hard to keep an eye on a fourteen-year-old Boy!
Roger::: Failure to comply. And another for bad behavior.
Gabriel:::Or are you just too stupid to do something so simple? You'd better find him and fast!
Roger::: And another one! And another one! And another one! 
Hawk Moth::: A failed bodyguard who can't perform his duties. Anger and frustration, perfect fodder for my akuma! Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!
Hawk Moth:::Gorizilla, I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you the tracking abilities you'll need to hunt down the person you've lost and accomplish your mission.
Adrien::: Good thinking, Marinette. Without these disguises we never would have made it here.
Marinette::: No. It was your idea to duck into this dark theater, remember? That was smart.
Adrien::: Actually, this is where I was heading when those crazed fans suddenly showed up. Thanks to you, my father won't find out.
Marinette::: Wait. You aren't allowed to go to the movies?
Adrien::: I am. With my bodyguard or Nathalie, of course. But I'm not sure my father would've allowed me to see this particular movie.
Marinette:::Oh no! Please don't tell me it's a horror movie! I hate horror movies!
Adrien::: No, no. Don't worry. It's a very rare movie that I've never been able to see. It's not on the Internet and my father's hidden the only DVD somewhere at home. See, my mother played the leading role.
Marinette::: Wow. I had no idea.
Adrien::: It's only being shown once. Today, in this theater. I couldn't talk to my father about it, so I decided to sneak out, unnoticed. 
Marinette::: I don't think the unnoticed bit went too well, actually.
Adrien::: Oh well. At least I'll get to see it. Not to mention this is the first time I've ever come to the movies with a friend. 
Commercial voice::: Radiant. Carefree.
Commercial voice and Marinette::: Dreamy. Adrien... the fragrance.
Marinette::: Ooh! It's starting!
Marinette and Adrien:::Huh?
Movie patron:::Adrien in a helmet at the movies with his girlfriend wearing a towel!
Wayhem::: Adrien's at the movies! 
Adrien::: We're trapped! What are we gonna do?
Movie patron::: Adrien likes movies. I like movies too!
Fan::: Adrien!
Adrien::: Are you...my bodyguard?!
Wayhem::: Let go of Adrien, right now!
Adrien:::Stop! I'm the one you wanted. Leave them alone!
Hawk Moth:::Gorizilla! You have fulfilled the first part of your mission. Now don't let go of Adrien! Not until Ladybug and Cat Noir come to rescue him!
Wayhem:::Adrien, I'm coming to save you! 
Marinette::: Adrien needs me!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!transforms into Ladybug.) 
Wayhem::: Put Adrien down right now!
Ladybug::: Put Adrien down right now!
Ladybug::: Let him go! 
Adrien::: Ladybug!
Hawk Moth:::She's alone! If Adrien is Cat Noir, then he'll have to transform to help her. Gorizilla, attack Ladybug!
Adrien::: There's no use! He's too strong!
Ladybug:::Cat Noir, where are you? I really need your help, fast! I'm at Montparnasse Tower!
Ladybug::: A toy remote-controlled helicopter appears) A helicopter? It really isn't a good time to play.
Hawk Moth:::Excellent! Now take Ladybug's Miraculous while we wait for Cat Noir!
Adrien::: I'm so sorry, Ladybug.
Ladybug::: Don't worry. Let me try to maneuver this...thing!
Hawk Moth:::Get Ladybug back!
Ladybug::: Hold on!
Ladybug::: Sorry!Let go of Adrien right now!
Ladybug::: Jump, Adrien! Quick!You have to trust me!
Adrien::: Always!Yeah-ha!
Hawk Moth:::No!
Ladybug::: No!
Plagg:::If you don't transform soon, you might wind up like a gooey pile of Camembert!
Adrien::: I can't, Plagg! Not in the open like this! I'm sure Ladybug has a plan. I trust her!
Wayhem:::Don't be scared, Adrien! I'm gonna catch you!
Hawk Moth:::If indeed you are Cat Noir, then transform, son. Please..Come on, son!
Ladybug::: Cat Noir, help!!
Hawk Moth:::Drop Ladybug!
Hawk Moth:::Gorizilla, get them back. And don't mess up this time!
Adrien::: I just knew I could count on you, M'Lad— uh, Ladybug.
Wayhem::: Adrien?You're safe!
Adrien::: Your earrings are flashing. Is there a problem?
Ladybug::: It means it won't be long before I transform back. But don't worry. Cat Noir will be here soon to take care of things..
Wayhem::: You can leave, Ladybug! I'll keep him at bay!
Ladybug:::No. I want you to find a safe place to hide.
Wayhem::: Oh, okay.You shall not pass!Radiant. Carefree. Dreamy. Adrien... the fragrance! 
Wayhem::: Ha ha ha! Now you won't be able to sniff out Adrien, will ya, you big hairy ape!Go ahead, try! 
Wayhem::: I'm coming, Adrien.
Adrien::: I think you lost him.
Ladybug:::Looks like it. Do you have any idea where his akuma could be? 
Adrien::: You're about to transform back. So you should just leave me here, and I'll stay hiddenwhile I wait for Cat Noir to turn up.
Ladybug:::But what if the supervillain finds you before he gets here?
Adrien:::He's my bodyguard. He won't hurt me.
Ladybug::: Of course! I know how we can track him.This way, I'll have enough time to find out where his akuma is!...so, meet us at the subway station. Adrien agreed to act as bait, but we really need you and your Cataclysm to make this work. Hurry up! 
Adrien::: What if Cat Noir doesn't turn up?
Ladybug::: Oh, he will! I trust him.
Adrien::: Yeah, you're right. I'm sure he'll be here.
Plagg:::And what rabbit are you planning to pull out of your hat now? You can't be Cat Noir and Adrien at the same time!
Adrien::: And what if I can?I need some help!
Wayhem:::Adrien!
Ladybug::: He's coming!Hurry up, Cat Noir.
Wayhem::: Over here!
Cat Noir::: Why don't you pick on someone your own size?Don't worry, Adrien, I won't let him touch a hair on your head!
Hawk Moth:::Adrien and Cat Noir side by side. So I was wrong. Just as well.Gorizilla, grab Cat Noir's Miraculous and be done with him!
Cat Noir::: Missed me! Missed me! Missed me again! That's it, big guy. Come on, just a little more.There! Cataclysm!This is Cat Noir Express Deliveries. Did you order a giant beast, M'Lady?
Ladybug::: I knew I could count on you, kitty! Where is Adrien?
Cat Noir:::He's safe.
Ladybug:::I'm very sorry, but I'm gonna have to search your pockets!Here you are!Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug!
Ladybug and Cat Noir:::Pound it!
Hawk Moth::: One of these days I'll find out who Ladybug and Cat Noir really are. And when I do, I'll make them pay for eternity!
Ladybug:::Adrien, are you okay?
Cat Noir::: He's totally fine! Right?See? If I were you, I wouldn't hang around too long.Unless you don't mind revealing your secret identity to all of us.
Ladybug::: Bye, Adrien! Bye, kitty! Bug out! 
Cat Noir:::Gotta scat too. Thanks for your help, Adrien. 
Wayhem:::That was awesome! I helped Cat Noir save Paris from that nasty big ape!
Adrien::: I knew I could count on you.I'm sorry I had to ask you to stand in for me earlier. You must think I'm not very brave.
Wayhem:::You kidding?I got to be in Adrien's shoes for a few minutes!A dream come true!I'm really sorry I posted that photo on the Internet. You must be mad at me.Is that your email?
Adrien::: Yeah. If you can manage to stop running after me screaming, I'm sure we can be good friends!
Wayhem:::I promise, Adrien!
Marinette::: Oh, Tikki! I went to the movies with Adrien! It's the best day of my life!Oh no! I went to the movies... with Adrien, in my pajamas, wearing funny glasses, and a towel! Oh! It's the worst day of my life!Alya! 
Alya::: Okay, Marinette! We all saw your pics online! But we're totally lost! We need the scoop.
Marinette::: Oh, right!Not surprised. I'll just change, then I'll be right over! Wait, where are you?
Alya::: At the swimming pool? We're still waiting, girl! 
Gabriel::: Sit down, Adrien.All you had to do was ask me.
Adrien::: I'm sorry, Father. I tried to talk to you, but you were so busy. In fact, I always feel like you don't want to talk at all, so—
Gabriel::: You should've trusted me, son. It's important for you and I to be able to trust each other. If you were to begin hiding the truth from me, then I'd naturally start imagining all kinds of things. 
Adrien::: Right, Father. Thank you.
