Juleka::: What are you giving Miss Bustier for her birthday, Rose?
Rose::: I made her a scrapbook.
Marinette:::Hey!
Alya::: Let me guess, you just finished your gift.
Marinette::: I hope Miss Bustier likes it.
Nathaniel::: I painted her as a superhero, because she's always here for us. 
Miss Bustier::: That's better. And now, hug each other.
Mylène::: I'll give her a braid of hair to thank her for her breathing class. It helps me to be less afraid of akumas.
Miss Bustier::: Breathe deeply. Think of your emotions like the surface of a quiet lake.Not that quiet, Kim.
Rose::: I got my inspiration from the exercise she has us do at the beginning of every class.
Rose::: 'Morning, Chloé! Your hair is really pretty today!
Chloé::: What do you mean, today? My hair is always pretty.Yeah, well, today, Rose, you seem less...annoying.
Rose:::Oh!
Rose::: Isn't it great to start the day by sharing a few kind words with each other?
Marinette:::Compared to those other gifts, mine's gonna be super lame!
Alya::: Don't worry, Marinette, there's no pressure!
Adrien::: How 'bout you, Marinette? I'm sure you've come up with something awesome, as usual.
Marinette::: Oh, me? Uh... It's nearly reffing at all. Uh! I mean... It's really nothing at all!If we wish to change the world, we must all learn to love each other. That's one of the first things Miss Bustier taught us when we first met her at school. I always keep it in mind.
Students::: Aww!
Marinette::: I also added this tube of lip balm — Miss Bustier's favorite color!
Alya::: Come to think of it, Miss Bustier is probably the reason we all get along so awesomely. 
Adrien::: I'm so lucky to get a teacher like her for my first year in school. How about you, Chloé? What's your present?
Marinette::: Nothing. Just like every year since kindergarten.
Sabrina::: It's not her fault, okay? Chloé just doesn't like birthdays! She never remembers them, just like her mom.
Chloé:::Yeah, well, you don't have to tell 'em my life story, either.Anyway, all that stuff about compliments and love? Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!
Marinette:::This girl's got no heart.
Chloé::: Uh, of course I have a heart! Daddy will even buy me a second one, if I want.
Kim:::What's our next lesson, again?
Max::: Physical science.
Sabrina::: We're going to be late for Ms. Mendeleiev's physics class, Chloé!
Chloé::: Permanent marker.Cap off.I do have a present for you, Marinette Dupain-Cheng. 
Marinette:::At last, this is Miss Bustier's class! This will be her best birthday ever!
Alix::: This is for you!
Rose:::Happy Birthday, Miss Bustier!
Miss Bustier::: Oh! Thank you!
Students::: Happy Birthday, Miss Bustier!
Miss Bustier::: Oh, you're all so sweet!
Alya::: Marinette made that one.
Marinette::: What..?I know you did this, Chloé Bourgeois!
Max:::A 99.56% certainty.
Alya::: So uncool, Chloé.
Marinette::: Seriously lame.
Miss Bustier::: Calm down. We don't want to get upset on my birthday, now, do we?Well, I think this present is wonderful.It'll be my new cosmetics bag! Then I'll be able to think of both of you every time I use it.
Marinette::: What? You're not gonna let her get away with this?!
Alya::: That girl is worse than Hawk Moth!
Alix::: At least half the city has gotten akumatized because of her!
Miss Bustier::: Students, please, calm down now!The classroom is not a place for insults and defamation! Marinette, would you come with me, please?
Marinette::: W-What?
Miss Bustier::: Alya. I'm relying on you to make sure things don't get out of hand while we're gone.
Alya::: Okay, Miss.
Hawk Moth::: That feeling of injustice! What could be worse than being punished for someone else's wrongdoings?Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her!
Marinette::: But Miss Bustier, it's so not fair! It was Chloé, pulling another...Chloé! And...I'm the one who's getting in trouble?!
Miss Bustier::: Of course you're not in trouble, don't worry! As the class representative, I want you to set a good example for your classmates. Don't give into feelings of anger. Try to forgive Chloé instead.
Hawk Moth:::Ugh...! The emotions have weakened! Get closer, akuma!
Marinette::: I don't get it... Chloé is the meanest person I've ever known.
Miss Bustier::: Come on... There are much worse people in Paris right now than Chloé Bourgeois. I'm sure people like Chloé are capable of great things. The problem is, they only think of themselves. They don't understand the meaning of love, and we can't force them to change. But perhaps we can show them by setting a good example. That's why Marinettes are so important in today's world; because they have a lot of love to give. I'm counting on you.
Marinette::: Yes, Miss Bustier.
Miss Bustier:::An akuma! Oh no! Go away! I won't let you evilize one of my students!
Hawk Moth:::There! The mere fear that harm might come to her little protégé! Fly, my little evil one, and akumatize her!
Miss Bustier::: No! No!
Marinette:::Don't give up! Think only positive thoughts!
Hawk Moth:::Hello, Miss. I am Hawk Moth.
Miss Bustier::: I am not going to listen to you! You can't force me to do evil!
Hawk Moth::: Who said anything about evil? There's already so much hate in the world. I want to help you unite everyone together with love, at last! Isn't that your greatest wish?
Marinette::: Miss Bustier, please! Breathe deeply and focus!
Hawk Moth::: Zombizou! I'm giving you the power to spread love and compassion. Thanks to you, the whole world will be one big embrace! In return, bring me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.
Miss Bustier::: I won't stop until everyone on Earth feels the love.Starting with...Chloé Bourgeois!
Marinette::: I will not let Hawk Moth do this to the best teacher in the world!
Marinette:::Tikki, spots on! Ah!
Zombizou::: I have got some great news for you, students! From now on, everyone's going to hug and kiss and feel the love! Even you, Chloé.
Chloé::: Me?
Chloé::: Ah! Yuck! Ew!
Sabrina::: Oh! What is that thing? 
Ladybug::: Please, Miss Bustier! You've gotta snap out of it!
Zombizou::: I'm not Miss Bustier anymore!I am Zombizou!
Adrien::: Get out, quick!
Sabrina::: I...feel... It's suddenly gotten very warm in here.I don't know what's happening, I...
Chloé::: Unh! What is wrong with you?
Sabrina::: Chloé...
Chloé::: Ugh! Get away from me!
Adrien::: Look out!
Sabrina:::Kissou.
Ivan::: Mylène!Are you okay?
Mylène:::I feel...feverish... I can't—Kissou...
Adrien:::They're contagious! Don't let yourselves get kissed!
Mylène::: Kissou!
Ivan::: Run! I'll hold them back!Stop it! No, you're tickling me!
Ivan, Mylène, Sabrina::: Kissou!
Zombizou::: I'll leave her in your hands, my lovelies. 
Zombizou::: Is Chloé Bourgeois in here?
Ms. Mendeleiev::: How dare you interrupt my class?! Who are you?!
Zombizou::: No? Oh well. Smoochies, my poochies! Mwah!
Zombizou::: Chloé Bourgeois? Not in here, either?Kisses, my lovelies!
Zombizou::: Chloé?
Mr. Damocles::: Excuse me, didn't anyone teach you to knock?!
Zombizou::: I don't like knocking, I prefer a gentle touch.Kissy-boo!
Mr. Damocles::: Huh?
Students::: Kissou!
Zombizou::: Chloé? I'll find you, sooner or later.
Students::: Kissy-boo!
Ladybug::: There! That should hold you for a while. 
Students:::Kissy! Kissy-boo!
Ladybug::: Oh! 
Ladybug::: Anybody here?!
Ladybug::: Anybody here?!Okay, not here either.
Ladybug::: Anybody here?
Chloé::: Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Oops! Sorry! Uh... Reflex.
Alya::: Ladybug?! Yeah! We're saved! 
Nino::: Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Are you all okay?
Alya::: Looks like it.
Nino::: Uh... Adrien? He still hasn't come out of his locker.
Ladybug::: Adrien?
Adrien:::Kissy-boo...
Alya::: Oh, man. He must've gotten kissed on the stairs when he was saving Chloé.
Ladybug::: We need to head to the roof.
Ivan::: Kissou! Mwah! Kissou!
Plagg::: Admit it. That was all just a ploy to try and get a kiss out of Ladybug.
Adrien::: Come on, don't be ridiculous. How else will we work under the radar?Plagg, claws out! 
Cat Noir::: Sorry, guys, no autographs this time!
Nadja:::Yet again, it seems citizens of Paris are in great danger. Since this morning, a strange disease is spreading.
Cat Noir::: Hey guys, I'm all for our French greetings, but let's hold off on the kisses for now, huh?
Ladybug::: I'm glad you're here, Cat Noir. Check this out. 
Nadja:::Hordes of kissing zombies are spreading throughout Paris!Let's go over to our Mayor, Mr. Bourgeois, live from City Hall.
Mr. Bourgeois:::We advise all Parisians to remain inside at this time.
Roger::: Kissy-poo!
Nadja::: Mr. Mayor? Mr. Mayor?
Chloé::: Daddy?!
Nadja::: It looks like we're having a slight technical issue.
Zombizou::: I took care of your father, Chloé. Show yourself!Then, Ladybug and Cat Noir? I'm coming for you. Mwah!Unless, of course, my sweethearts get hold of you first; because very soon, the whole city will be hot on your heels! 
Alix::: Chloé! Hunh! Always Chloé! You only think about yourself!
Alya::: I don't know why we don't just give them what they want.
Nino::: Yeah! Good idea!
Chloé::: Is it my fault if I'm better than all of you?
Ladybug::: Sorry to disappoint you guys, but Chloé doesn't deserve to get hit any more than you.And we need her as bait to lure Zombizou when the time is right.
Chloé:::Uh...thanks?
Rose:::They're coming!
Ladybug::: We've gotta evacuate!Over there! Cat Noir, do you know how to drive?
Cat Noir::: You should know the answer to that, M'Lady. I can do anything.
Ladybug::: Kitties first, then.
Cat Noir:::Woo-hoo!
Chloé::: Max and Kim, you go first.
Ladybug::: Hurry up!
Student::: Kissou-kissou-kissou!
Kim::: Max!Come on, Chloé!
Max::: Ki...
Chloé::: Play the hero as much as you like, Kim, but you won't be getting a kiss out of me.
Kim::: Just go, before I change my mind.
Cat Noir::: Slow down, Chloé!
Chloé::: Hello?! Who's gonna come and save me?
Cat Noir::: Yoo-hoo! Kissy-kissy-kissy!
Juleka::: Rose, no!
Rose::: I can't just leave her by herself!
Chloé::: Ow! Great!Now I've twisted my ankle because you weren't fast enough!
Kim::: You take care of Chloé. Besides, you'll save all of us, like you always do, right?
Ladybug::: Yeah. That's a promise!
Zombie::: Lady wants a kissy...
Juleka:::Rose!
Cat Noir::: Na-na-na-na-nah! Kissy-kissy-kissy!Hurry up; we gotta go now. 
Ladybug::: I thought you said you knew how to drive!
Cat Noir::: I've mastered every car and racetrack in Extreme Racing 3, but there are no buses in that game.
Juleka::: Are you okay?
Rose::: Yeah...just a close call, that's all.
Cat Noir::: So, what now?
Ladybug::: Let's take Chloé to the top of the Eiffel Tower. There'll be less zombies up there, and fewer places for all of Zombizou's disciples to run to.
Cat Noir::: Less places for us to hide, too.
Ladybug::: But it's the only way if we want Zombizou to turn up in perso—
Rose::: Kissou!
Alix::: I totally trust you, Ladybug!
Chloé::: Ogh! People need to stop invading my personal space!
Hawk Moth:::Don't forget our agreement, Zombizou.
Zombizou::: No one can escape my kiss! 
Cat Noir::: Stay together and follow me!
Ladybug:::Nino! The vending machine! Quick! Everybody, inside the elevator!
Alya:::Faster, faster!
Ladybug::: Alya!
Nino::: Oh...no!
Cat Noir::: There's nothing we can do for her.Come on!
Alya::: He's right.Just go, and save us all.
Ladybug:::Nino?Nino!
Cat Noir::: It doesn't matter that we're the only ones left, Bugaboo, since you'll fix it all in the end anyway.
Chloé::: Only the best remain.
Nino:::This isn't the first time we've been in trouble together.
Alya::: Kissou. 
Ladybug::: Straight ahead. Gustave Eiffel's office! 
Cat Noir::: Ladybug, catch!
Chloé::: ...Phew.
Ladybug:::Cat Noir!
Cat Noir::: I'll just stay here and chill, M'Lady. If we're going to end up kissing, then I'd rather do it after you save us, okay?
Ladybug::: No!
Cat Noir::: You're the only one who can fix this for us. No arguing now!
Ladybug::: It's down to you and me.Chloé? 
Chloé::: At least I won't get in your way now. Good luck!
Zombizou::: Hand over Chloé and your Miraculous, Ladybug. Then I might just let you witness the final triumph of love!
Hawk Moth:::Victory has never been so close!
Ladybug::: make-up remover appears)
Chloé:::Make-up remover? How are you going to save my life with that?
Cat Noir:::Cataclysm! 
Ladybug:::Cat Noir!
Cat Noir::: Kissou. 
Ladybug::: Don't worry, kitty... You'll get your kisses... But first, I have a Lucky Charm I need to use. 
Chloé:::I'm sorry!
Ladybug::: What?
Chloé::: Oh, this is all my fault!
Ladybug:::Awesome. But...now's not exactly a good time.
Chloé::: Save us all, Ladybug.
Zombizou::: You're all alone, Ladybug. Accept my love, and give me your Miraculous!
Ladybug::: This is not true love!
Ladybug::: No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug!
Hawk Moth::: Ladybug... Cat Noir! If Zombizou is right...if love does always conquer...then someday, my most cherished wish will come true for sure!
Ladybug & Cat Noir:::Pound it!
Miss Bustier::: Ladybug?! Cat Noir? What on earth—?The akuma overtook me, oh no, I...I let my negative emotions get the upper hand, how terrible! ...I'm terrible.
Ladybug::: That's not true! It wasn't your fault. Hawk Moth is the one to blame.
Miss Bustier::: But I hurt a lot of people...
Chloé::: No... I did... I forgot your birthday, once again. And when I saw everyone had prepared a gift for you, I totally lost it. Because I, too, would've liked to offer you something. I'm sorry, Miss Bustier.
Miss Bustier::: Thank you, Chloé. Those words are the best possible gift you could ever give me. 
Chloé::: Huh?... Uh, yeah. Okay then, we're all good.
Cat Noir::: Woo-hoo!
Chloé::: Me? You want me to apologize to the entire class? Ridiculous! They should be thanking me for saving everybody. 
Alya::: I happen to have several accounts of what went down, including my own, and they don't exactly match your version.
Marinette:::I heard you helped Ladybug and saved Miss Bustier! Awesome! There really is a heart beating in there after all. Sorry I said there wasn't. 
Alya::: Uh, but—!
Marinette:::And thanks! 
Alya::: Marinette? Girl, are you still Zombizoufied, or what?
Marinette::: I've realized Chloé has a heart, too. She just doesn't know how to use it. Hopefully, she'll learn if we continue setting a positive example.
Miss Bustier::: 'Morning, everyone!
Students::: 'Morning, Miss Bustier!
Miss Bustier::: Glad to see you all! As usual, we'll start the day by giving a nice compliment to your neighbor.
