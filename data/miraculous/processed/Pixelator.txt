Caline::: Thanks to the generosity of Mr. Bourgeois, we're able to have our work experience field trip today at the Grand Paris luxury hotel. Each of you will get hands-on experience with one of the many jobs here at the hotel.You'll be graded on your effort, which will affect whether you pass or fail the class. 
Ms. Bustier::: Do you have Marinette and Alya on your list, Mr. Bourgeois?
Mr. Bourgeois::: It doesn't look like it.
Alya:::I bet I know who helped Daddy make the assignment.
Marinette::: Of course, she gets to spent her entire day with Adrien... Ugh! This is gonna be the worst day ever! 
Mr. Bourgeois::: It must be an oversight.
Chloé::: Daddy! 
Mr. Bourgeois::: Thank you, sweetie. Oh yes! Alya, you're going to be... sorting trash at the main dumpster. 
Mr. Bourgeois::: And, Marinette will be...
Chloé::: Wow!
Marinette::: Hey! That's...
Mr. Bourgeois::: Excuse me, but this is a luxury hotel, not a... 
Chloé::: Daddy!That's Jagged, the rockstar. He's sold millions of albums, he's very famous and is very, very rich.
Mr. Bourgeois::: Mr. Stone, welcome to the Grand Paris Hotel! I am Mayor Bourgeois, the owner of this luxury establishment, in fact, the most luxurious in all of Paris. How might we serve you?
Jagged::: How'd you think? I didn't just come here to admire your lobby.
Penny Rolling::: Jagged would like to check into your most luxurious suite.
Jagged::: And Fang better get a real bathtub, not a tiny water hole like the one in that hotel across the street.
Mr. Bourgeois::: We have everything you need, Ms. Fang. Even a state-of-the-art entertainment center! 
Jagged::: Fang's me crocodile. 
Mr. Bourgeois::: Mr. Stone, we have everything you require for your...Fang. Would he, um... enjoy a bubble bath? 
Jagged::: Crocodiles don't like bubble baths, that dries their scales out!
Jagged:::Oh, no. Not him again.
Vincent::: Remember me, Mr. Stone? Vincent Aza! Just one photo to show everyone in the world that we're best buds! Come on, please! I'm your biggest fan!
Jagged::: I know, you've been to my last 36 shows. But we are not friends.
Vincent::: There! Look into the lens!to take his picture, but gets interrupted by Penny, who takes his camera)
Penny::: Didn't you hear Mr. Stone? You still haven't got it, have you?No photos!
Penny::: Good reflexes. Now don't let me see you near Mr. Stone again. Or next time, you won't get your camera back.
Hawk Moth:::I sense brewing anger and frustration. Perfect father for my evil little akumas. It won't be long now.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!
Hawk Moth::: Pixelator, I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you the power to capture your hero's smile, forever. But in return, you'll need to do some capturing for me as well.
Vincent::: Yes, Hawk Moth. 
Ms. Bustier::: Mr. Bourgeois, you haven't told Marinette what job she'll be doing.
Mr. Bourgeois:::Ah, yes. Of course, Marinette. Gopher. I've got a job for you already, Marinette.
Alya::: Gopher? What's that?
Marinette::: I'm guessing it's about as bad as trash duty.
Penny::: Mr. Stone is going to need a new pair of shades for tonight's gig. Red, white and blue with two large Eiffel Towers on them. Can you get that for him?
Mr. Bourgeois::: Of course we can! Marinette here is our gopher. She'll take care of that for you.
Marinette::: Huh?
Mr. Bourgeois::: A gopher is an employee who goes for anything a customer needs. Anything at all. So go ahead. Goph!
Marinette::: These should do the trick. Now I can get back to the hotel and hang with Adrien! Ugh... And Chloé.
Tikki::: You know these aren't even close to what Mr. Stone wants.
Marinette::: What do you mean, Tikki? There's some red and white on it, and two little Eiffel Towers.
Tikki::: Just saying, it's better in a long run to do it right the first time.
Tikki::: Meow.
Jagged::: Where are the Eiffel Towers?
Marinette::: Um... here.
Jagged::: This is a joke, right? What are you doing, trying to ruin my career?
Marinette::: But, Mr. Stone, the glasses you want don't exist!
Jagged::: Do I look like I care? Just get me those sunglasses!
Marinette::: Great. I'm gonna have to spend even more time away from Adrien!
Tikki::: That's what I've been trying to tell you! Just do it right the first time.
Marinette::: Yeah... You're right, Tikki. I get it now.
Tikki::: Those sunglasses exist somewhere... Get creative!
Marinette::: ...Of course! 
Chloé::: Failed as a gopher already? Not surprised. Don't let the door hit you on the way out!
Worker::: Excuse me sir, can I help you?
Pixelator::: Look into the lens...
Pixelator::: Photo finish.
Chloé::: Oh, look what the cat dragged in. Let me handle this, Adrien. Watch and learn.Excuse me... Excuse me! You can't be a guest at this hotel! My father only allows the most important celebrities. Like me.
Pixelator::: Well then, I am Pixelator. Your number one fan.
Chloé::: Moi? Oh, my, you're flattering me. Keep going.
Pixelator::: A photo of you, sweet miss...
Chloé::: Chloé, of course.
Adrien::: Look out, Chloé!
Pixelator::: Look into the lens, miss!
Adrien::: What the...
Chloé::: What just happened?
Adrien::: I think we've been like... digitized or something.
Chloé::: What do you mean, digitized?
Adrien::: I don't really know, but I don't think it's a good thing.
Chloé::: Well, I can fix this. Leave it to me.Daddy?... Daddy??... DADDY?!
Marinette::: Where did I put them... Oh!Voila!
Tikki::: But they're pink.
Marinette::: They won't be when I'm done with them. This is either gonna be the most amazing pair or the ugliest pair of shades in shades history. Ms. Bustier is grading me on effort, right?
Tikki::: Don't worry, I'm sure Jagged will love them!
Tikki::: Or hate them.
Chloé::: Ugh! I still can't get through to Daddy! How can there be no cell reception here? Ridiculous!
Adrien::: It just goes on forever. No doors, no walls, no nothing...
Chloé::: You mean we're stuck here? Just...just the two of us?
Adrien::: Uh, no. There's gotta be a way out somewhere.I hope...
Marinette::: Adrien? Chloé? Ughh! I bet those two have gone off together somewhere fun! Hmph! And now I'm here all alone without Adrien...
Tikki::: Marinette, snap out of it, let's just focus on getting Mr. Stone's glasses for now, okay?
Pixelator::: Jagged?
Alec::: What?
Pixelator:::Look into the lens!
Penny::: I'll give them to Mr. Stone.
Marinette::: Can't you deliver them to him now?
Penny::: He's... resting.
Jagged::: Now who likes having his belly scratch? Daddy's little Fang!
Marinette::: Okay, no problem. Just trying to do the job right the second time.
Penny::: Got it.
Marinette::: Thank you...
Marinette::: I hope Mr. Stone likes them.
Tikki::: Hard work always pays off.
Penny::: Who are you?
Pixelator::: Look into the lens! 
Marinette:::Time to transform!
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ah!
Pixelator::: Hey there! Time for your photoshoot!
Jagged::: How did you get in here? I don't know about any photos. Fang, attack! 
Pixelator::: See you later, alligator. 
Jagged::: What? Fang? Fang! Who are you?
Pixelator::: I am Pixelator, your biggest fan, Mr. Stone. Can I called you Jagged?
Jagged::: No!
Pixelator::: I want to immortalize you, Jagged! I'll be your one and only fan! You will belong to me for eternity! Now, look into the lens.
Pixelator::: So, you're Ladybug. I've heard such pathetic things about you. Look into the lens!
Pixelator::: Ugh! Where did they go?
Hawk Moth::: If you want Jagged, you must find Ladybug.
Pixelator::: I don't have time to deal with this Ladybug!
Hawk Moth::: Yes, you do. Plenty of time. 
Pixelator::: Okay, okay! Tell me what to do.
Hawk Moth::: I command an excellent photograph of Ladybug with her Miraculous. I want those powers! So listen very carefully.
Jagged::: I can't stay here. I'm performing tonight.
Ladybug::: Don't worry, you'll get to do your gig. You'll even get to wear some awesome shades!
Jagged::: Uh?
Ladybug:::Look. While I'm catching this guy, Pixelator, I need you to stay put where no one would think to look for you.
Mr. Damocles::: Hm. Ladybug, is this safe? This is a school.
Ladybug::: Yes! Pixelator would never imagine his idol would actually want a day out at school.
Mr. Damocles::: Hmm?
Ladybug::: I mean, isn't school awesome?
Jagged::: This is ridiculous. I don't have time for this. First, I get practically hijacked by this crazed fan, and then, I'm attacked by some super weirdo, then...
Ladybug::: Wait. What do you know about this crazed fan?
Jagged::: He's come to every one of my shows this year. He's also sent me stacks of letters, gone through my trash, he even followed my mother to her weekly bingo night!
Ladybug::: How creepy.
Jagged::: Uh, not really, it's just a bunch of elderly ladies getting together having fun.
Ladybug:::Vincent... Aza.Got his address.
Jagged::: You're not gonna leave me here, are you?
Mr. Damocles::: Hmm?
Jagged::: I mean, isn't school awesome?
Chloé::: Daddy! Daddy!
Adrien::: Plagg, I gotta find some way to transform.
Plagg::: Come on, what's the rush?
Plagg::: Fine. If you insist, at least find me some cheese.
Adrien:::I'm gonna see if there's a way out down there. Don't go anywhere. Could be dangerous. 
Chloé::: Dangerous?
Adrien::: You're not scared, are you?
Chloé::: Scared, moi? As if! No way!
Hawk Moth::: Ah, the Champs-Élysées. Perfect. May the photoshoot begin.
Pixelator::: Amateur. 
Ladybug::: Oh, this isn't creepy at all.
Ladybug::: What? 
Adrien::: Ladybug?
Ladybug::: What are you two doing there?
Chloé::: Ladybug! Remember me? Your biggest fan? Please, please get us out of here. It's terrible in here!I mean, it's only terrible when you're not around.
Théo::: Over here, Ladybug!
Mireille::: Help... Ladybug!
Ladybug::: What happened to you?
Théo::: It's terrible, this man, he... took a photo of us and we ended up trapped in here!
Mireille::: While we were just simply strolling the Champs-Élysées!
Ladybug::: I sure hope Cat Noir's there already! 
Nadja:::Excuse me, sir, sir? Care for an interview with the reporter who spreads the villains' voice? 
Pixelator::: I will continue my photoshoot until Jagged turns up here in the flesh! Where are you, Jagged? Your biggest fan awaits you! All I want is one photo! Otherwise, soon, the people of Paris will be nothing but memories. 
Mr. Damocles::: This is terrible!
Jagged::: I've got to do what Pixelator says!
Mr. Damocles::: Surely, you can't be serious! It's dangerous out there!
Jagged::: Who cares about danger? Jagged Stone can turn down a television appearance! Just imagine what it would do for my career!
Ladybug::: Got an itchy trigger finger, eh? 
Pixelator::: I was expecting you, Ladybug.
Pixelator::: Look into the lens!
Ladybug::: I have a proposition to make! If you free those innocent people, I'll organize a photoshoot with Jagged!
Hawk Moth::: No! Don't listen to her! She's trying to trick you!
Pixelator::: Why should I believe you, Ladybug?
Ladybug::: Because you have no choice. I'm the only one who knows where Jagged is.
Pixelator::: How about I free half of them now and the other half after the photoshoot. Deal?
Ladybug::: 'Kay. It's a deal.Yeah, right.
Nino::: Dudes! You just scared me!
Adrien:::Fill in for me, will you Nino?
Nino::: What do you think I've been doing this whole time?
Plagg::: If you want my opinion, I think someone's been akumatized.
Adrien::: I think you're right. But where's the akuma?
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Pixelator::: I've kept my part of the deal, Ladybug, now bring me Jagged!
Ladybug::: Pixelator, I know your akuma's inside your glasses!
Pixelator::: Stop wasting time!
Civilian::: Cat Noir.
Ladybug::: Thanks for dropping in.
Cat Noir::: Not very handy, I see.
Pixelator::: What about out deal?
Hawk Moth::: I told you she would betray you. Capture them already, I want their Miraculous!
Ladybug::: Together!
Cat Noir::: Ahh! Oh, not again...
Pixelator::: When the cat's away, the mice will play. Ready to become immortalized?
Ladybug::: Can't wait to live it up.
Pixelator::: Look into the lens!
Jagged::: Hey there, Pixelator! I've heard you wanted my photo!
Ladybug::: Get ourt of here, Mr. Stone! 
Jagged::: It's me you wanted all this time, wight? Well, here I am. In the flesh.
Pixelator::: Look into the lens...
Jagged::: Wait, wrong side. This isn't my best angle. No, no, wait. The lighting's all wrong. Does my nose look shorter this way? Oh, I know, this is better.
Pixelator::: Ugh... Hurry up already!
Ladybug::: powder compact appears) A powder compact?
Jagged::: There, I think I'm ready.
Pixelator::: No more moving! Look into the lens!
Ladybug::: Don't do it, Mr. Stone!
Cat Noir::: Cataclysm! 
Pixelator::: Come on, open your eyes.
Ladybug::: Batter up! 
Pixelator::: Huh... How did... Huh?
Hawk Moth::: Next time I assure you it won't be a photo finish! I won't stop, Ladybug! I'll destroy you!
Ladybug::: Miraculous Ladybug!No more evildoing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly.
Vincent::: Huh? What happened? Where am I?
Ladybug & Cat Noir::: Pound it!
Ms. Bustier::: Thank you very much for this work experience day, Mr. Bourgeois. I'm sure we'll all remember it for a long time to come.
Mr. Bourgeois::: So do I. Oh, wait, I almost forgot. Jagged's giving a concert tonight, so, I'm giving tickets to the students who demonstrated the greatest effort today.
Chloé:::Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!
Jagged::: Good evening, Paris! 
Adrien:::It's my first live concert, ever! It's amazing!
Marinette:::Yeah, amazing!
Jagged::: I'd like to dedicate this song to the girl who saved my life. This one's for you, Ladybug.
