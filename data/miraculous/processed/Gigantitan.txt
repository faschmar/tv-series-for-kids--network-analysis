Alya::: Thanks for showing up, girls. So, check this out. I've got the...biggest...scoop! But FYI, it's seriously hush-hush. Top secret, classified information.
Alix::: You know who Ladybug is? 
Alya::: No, but it's almost as hot. Marinette is—
Marinette::: Wait, Alya.Do you really think this is such a good idea?
Alya::: I don't think it is, I know it is. But remember, girls, your lips are sealed. Got it? 
Girls:::Mm-hmm.
Alya::: Well, Marinette is head-over-heels for somebody.
Alix::: Yeah, Adrien.
Marinette::: What? But how did you know?
Mylène::: Well, it is pretty obvious.
Marinette::: So, do you think...I mean...Adrien knows too?
Rose::: No way. Boys never pick up on things like that.
Girls:::Mm-hmm.
Alya::: Right, so let's get down to business. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to arrange a ridiculously romantic date between Marinette and Adrien.
Rose::: Oh, that's so sweet!
Alix::: Great!
Juleka::: Big time!
Mylène::: We know we can always count on you, Marinette; so you can count on us too.
Marinette::: Aw, thanks, girls.
Alya::: You're up, Marinette.
Marinette::: Alya and I have come up with a plan. It's called Operation: Secret Garden.
Mylène::: Excuse me, but why do we need a plan? I mean, can't Marinette just go up to Adrien and ask him out?
Alya::: Seriously, Mylène? This is Marinette we're talking about here. Now, each one of you will have a codename based on a flower. Alix, you'll be Violet. Mylène, you'll be Sunflower. Juleka, you'll be Rose. And Rose will be Tulip. 
Rose::: Um, why isn't my name Rose?
Alya::: Because Rose is your real name.
Marinette::: It won't be a codename if we call you Rose.This afternoon, Buttercup has a photo shoot at the Trocadéro fountains.
Rose::: Hmm...
Alix:::Adrien!
Rose::: Ah!
Marinette::: His security guard, a.k.a. the Nanny, will be waiting for him in the car on the other side of the esplanade, in the chariot. He's supposed to take Buttercup back home after the photo shoot, except that's not gonna happen. This is where you guys come in.Step one: Rose will have a fake No Parking sign. She'll go over to— 
Mylène::: Um, who's Rose again?
Rose::: Me, of course!
Alya::: No, Rose. It's Juleka. You're Tulip.Violet. Sunflower. Rose. Tulip. 
Marinette::: So, step one: Rose, you put the fake sign next to the Nanny's chariot.
Marinette:::Step two: Sunflower, you'll go find a police officer and say to him:Hello, Mr. Police-Officer. Oh, look! That car's parked illegally.Well, you don't say! I shall enforce the law right this second! Thank you, young lady.
Marinette::: Step three: No more Nanny.Step four: Tiger-Lily will let us know as soon as Buttercup's done with his photo shoot.
Alya:::Tiger-Lily.
Marinette:::But, instead of meeting up with the Nanny, Adrien's gonna find...
Alya::: Lotus!
Rose:::That's Marinette!
Alix:::But when Buttercup sees that the chariot's gone, he'll just text his Nanny, won't he?
Marinette:::Impossible. Buttercup always leaves his personal items in the car when he's on a photo shoot, even his phone!Such a professional!
Alix:::She knows everything about Adrien! Creepy, no?
Rose::: Yes! It's so romantic!
Marinette::: So then...
Marinette:::Hey, Marinette! (They walk closer to each other, rickshaw driver to come and park in the Nanny's car spot, then all I need to do is say to Adrien— 
Alix:::Bdi-di-di-di, di-di-di-di, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-dii! 
Alya::: You're right, that's usually how it goes!
Marinette::: But this time I'm really ready! I've got you guys with me. I'm gonna do it, I promise!
Mylène::: You're gonna be great!
Alix::: Wooo! Yeah!
Marinette:::So I say to him, Since your car's not here we might as well ride home together. Hey, look! What a co-inky-dink! There's a rickshaw right here!Awesome idea, Marinette! I've always dreamed of going on a rickshaw with you!We take a really romantic ride along the banks of the Seine and over the Pont des Arts bridge, where we just happen to run into André, the sweethearts' ice cream maker!Then, Violet skates by and showers us with rose petals!It's gonna be perfect!
Rose::: It's...it's... so beautiful!
Alya::: Any questions?
Juleka:::Which flower am I, again?
Rose::: You're Rose. That's right, right?
Marinette::: Mm-hmm.
Rose:::Yes!
Marinette:::Operation: Secret Garden, here we come!
Vincent::: Come on, more happy! The smile like you're smelling a delicious lunch in ze kitchen! Ah! No, no! We need a...A lollipop! 
Vincent:::There!
August::: Lollipop! Lollipop!
Vincent::: Now we have a good taste! Mm-hmm.
August::: Lollipop! Lollipop!
August's mother::: No, August. Lollipops are not for babies. Your snack is a delicious bottle of milk. 
Alya::: Are all the flowers planted?
Juleka:::Rose planted.
Mylène:::Sunflower planted.
Rose:::Tulip planted!
Marinette::: Perfect! Go, Rose!
Rose::: Uh, me?
Alya::: No, the other Rose!
Juleka::: Um, you guys, I've got a problem.
Marinette::: Rose?
Rose::: Yeah, what?
Juleka:::There's a problem. It's stuck in a grate.
Marinette::: Rose, louder!
Rose:::YEAH, WHAT?!
Mylène::: Uh oh!What's this big sign made of?
Marinette::: Metal, like, you know, the type road signs are made of. Why?
Mylène::: Couldn't you have made it out of cardboard or something?Go and get the police officer.
Marinette::: Caution! The photo shoot of Buttercup will be over soon!
Alix:::Aw, seriously? Enough with the chit chat!
Roger::: Huh? Oh, I know you! You're in the same class with my daughter!
Juleka:::Hello, sir. The Parking sign, um, is....
Roger::: Huh? Tell me about it. Those pigeons are such a nuisance.
Juleka::: Huh?
Marinette::: Come on, Rose! Do it now!
Rose::: Okay! 
Alya::: Not you, Tulip! The other Rose!
Rose:::No, wait! 
Mylène::: Come on, Rose. You can do it!
Juleka:::ILLEGALLY PARKED CAR!!
Roger::: Hmm?
Marinette::: Yes!
Roger::: Oh!
Roger::: Thank you, young lady. 
Marinette::: Great job, Rose!
Vincent::: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Look at me! Give me your best smile!
August::: Lollipop! Lollipop!
August's mother::: No, August. Mommy told you already. You're too young for lollipops.
Marinette::: That poor lady. She could really use a hand.
Alya::: If you do that, Adrien will see you!
August's mother::: Oh, here you go, honey. 
Roger::: Sir, move this vehicle right away. This is a no-parking zone!
Roger::: Move it! Move it! Move it!
Théo::: Hey, watch it!
Roger::: He's right! Be careful!
Rose::: U-turn, please.
Roger::: Mm-hmm.
Marinette::: Bravo, girls! Step two, commence!
Vincent::: It's perfect! Hold it right there!
August's mother::: Oh!
Alya::: Lotus— Uh, Marinette! Stay here!
Marinette:::Hello, ma'am.Hello, little baby! 
August's mother::: Thank you so much!
Vincent:::All right, have a good day!
Alya:::Look out, Buttercup's on the move!
Marinette::: Sorry!Here you go!
August's mother::: Thank you, young lady.
Marinette::: You're welcome! Bye!
Marinette::: Red alert! The Nanny's back!
Juleka::: What?Um...
Roger::: Yes?Hey you, mister! Over there! You've asked for it! I'm slapping you with a fine for a parking violation, for non-compliance with orders, and for infuriating a usually cheerful police officer!
Hawk Moth::: A man who takes his work very seriously, whose blood is boiled by the slightest shortfall. That's what I call an easy target for my dear akumas.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!
August's mother::: You're being quite stubborn today, August. 
Hawk Moth:::What happened? His emotions just vanished!
August:::Lollipop! Lollipop! Lollipop! 
Hawk Moth:::This wasn't what I had in mind. But why not? After all, what could be more emotionally powerful than a baby throwing a giant temper tantrum?! Gigantitan, I am Hawk Moth.
August::: Hawk...Moo?
Hawk Moth:::No, not Hawk Moo. Just Hawk Moth. Well, you're going to be...big and strong, and you'll get to do...whatever you want. But in return, you must bring me back Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.
August::: Lollipop?
Hawk Moth:::Not lollipop! Miraculous! Mi-ra-cu-lous!!
August's mother:::My little baby!
Gigantitan::: LOLLIPOP!!Lollipop!
Marinette::: Kids these days. They grow up so fast! Am I right?
Bystander::: It's a baby!
Alya:::Whoa, don't blink now!
Mylène:::Come on!
Gigantitan::: Lollipop!Bleugh!Lollipop! Ooh?Bleugh! 
August's mother::: August!
Marinette::: Stay out of danger, ma'am. Ladybug and Cat Noir will be here any moment now and save your little August.
Plagg::: Aww, I was just about to take a cheese break!
Adrien::: Aw, don't be such a baby, Plagg!
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out!
Rose::: Girls, where is Lotus?Marinette, where is she?! 
Mylène::: Hey, look!
Gigantitan::: Lollipop! 
Cat Noir::: Well, you're the biggest rugrat I've ever seen. 
Gigantitan::: Kitty!
Cat Noir::: Let's go splish-splash, mega-baby.You can't catch me!Let's get our feet nice and wet. But we can't squish anyone, okay?
Marinette::: Lure him to the river where there's nothing to destroy. Nice move, Cat Noir!
Tikki::: Looks like that romantic outing with Adrien is on hold.
Marinette::: We'll be pausing for an epic battle with Cat Noir instead.
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on! Ha!
Gigantitan::: Lolli! 
Ladybug::: Well, hey there, kitty cat. I see you're not much of a natural with kids, are you?
Cat Noir::: Are you kidding? We were just playing a fun game of tag! 
Ladybug::: The akuma's probably in his bracelet. 
Hawk Moth:::Gigantitan, watch out for the very naughty Ladybug!
Cat Noir:::Whoa-ho! How about that? You're not much of a natural with kids either. Nice flying.
Ladybug::: Ha-ha! For your information, I never babysat anything heavier than ten tons.
Gigantitan::: Kitty?
Ladybug:::Yes!
Ladybug::: Change of plans! To calm the baby down, just put him in a playpen.
Cat Noir::: And exactly where are we gonna find a playpen his size?
Ladybug::: The Eiffel Tower! We'll pen him up in there with my yo-yo string. Sing him some lullabies. You know some, don't you? We can read him a bedtime story! Make cooing noises.Then when he's getting sleepy...BAM! You'll use your Cataclysm to destroy his bracelet!
Cat Noir::: Interesting idea, M'Lady. But how are we gonna get him there? Don't you have a simpler plan? How about your Lucky Charm?
Ladybug::: If this is too complicated, just copy what I do.
Cat Noir::: Uh?
Ladybug::: Yoohoo!
Cat Noir::: Over here, little guy!Once we get him in his playpen, I'll sing him a lullaby.
Ladybug::: Uh, we want to calm the baby down, not burst his eardrums.
Cat Noir::: What? I have a great voice, you know? I'll meow you a serenade one of these days. 
Gigantitan::: Lollipop! Lollipop! 
Ladybug::: Hey!
Cat Noir::: Over here!
Ladybug::: Hey, over here! Big baby!
Cat Noir::: This way!
Ladybug::: We're losing him, Cat Noir!
Gigantitan::: Lollipop! 
Gigantitan::: Kitty!
Gigantitan::: Vroom!
Gigantitan::: Vroom! Vroom!
Cat Noir::: I loved playing with cars when I was a kid, too.
Gigantian:::Vroom! Vroom!
Ladybug::: Look! He's going to his playpen all by himself! Good job, kitty!
Hawk Moth:::No! Stop playing! Attack the kitty cat and Ladybug!
Gigantitan::: Vroom!
Hawk Moth:::Oh no!
Ladybug::: Here we go!Hurry, Cat Noir! Use your Cataclysm on his bracelet!
Cat Noir::: At your command, M'Lady! Cataclysm!
Alix:::Did she take the rickshaw ride with Adrien or not?
Cat Noir::: I hear your ice cream's the best in Paris, André. 
André::: Uh, thank you, Cat Noir.
Hawk Moth:::Turn around! Look at the mean Ladybug! Grab her!!
Gigantitan:::Lollipop! 
Ladybug::: Hey, silly baby! This isn't a delicious lollipop! 
Alya::: Woohoo! Super-size!
Rose::: Hold on tight, Ladybug!
Ladybug::: Thanks, girls!
Gigantitan::: Lollipop!
Hawk Moth:::NO!! Don't let the Ladybug get away! 
Cat Noir:::Quick! We don't have much time left! 
Ladybug::: Okay! Enough with complicated plans. Sometimes it's best to just get straight to the point. Lucky Charm!Gift wrap?
Cat Noir::: Great! Now figure something out so we can wrap this up.
Ladybug::: Got it!
Alya:::Girls...I can't do it anymore!RUN!!!
Gigantitan::: Lollipop! 
Cat Noir::: Who wants a nice tasty lollipop?
Gigantitan::: Lollipop! 
Ladybug::: You've heard of the Trojan Horse. Now meet the Parisian lollipop!No more evil-doing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug!
August::: Kitty!
Ladybug::: Okay, you are a natural with babies after all. 
August's mother::: August! 
August::: Mama!
Ladybug:::We gotta get going. Bye bye, little guy. 
August's mother::: Thank you, Cat Noir! Thank you, Ladybug!
August::: Thank you!
Hawk Moth::: Ladybug and Cat Noir, Gigantitan may not have been big enough for the job, but I promise my next villain will be more than you can handle!
Marinette::: Hey, guys!
Rose::: Marinette!
Juleka::: That was weird.
Mylène::: I was so worried about you!
Alya::: Where were you?
Marinette::: I was worried, too. I looked all over for you guys. I'm so glad everything worked out okay.
Alya::: All except for your date with Adrien.
Mylène::: Oh yeah. Where did he go?
Rose:::Oh! There he is!
Alya::: Maybe we can finish the job after all.
Juleka::: Awesome.
Marinette::: No. No more complicated plans. Sometimes it's best to just get straight to the point.Adrien!
Adrien::: Marinette! What are you doing here?
Mylène::: Is she gonna do it?
Rose::: It's just like a romantic movie!
Marinette::: I came here to do some sketching!I can't believe we've run into each other here! Hey, would you like to—? Hang pout? I mean, hang about? No, hag out?Oh, forget it.Better not keep your guard waiting.
Adrien::: Uh, okay.But we can take you home if you want it.
Rose::: Whew...
Juleka::: All right!
Marinette::: No, it's okay! I'll take a coleslaw home. Thanks!
Adrien::: Okay... enjoy your meal, then.See you at school tomorrow! 
Marinette:::Why did I say no? I'm so lame! I could have ridden home with him in his car!
Alya::: Well, at least you managed to get a sentence out without losing your cool.
Rose::: One sentence out of three! Not bad!
Mylène::: You'll get there in the end.
Juleka::: Sure will.
Marinette::: Thanks, girls. 
Alix::: Don't tell me Buttercup left the flowerbed with the Nanny.
Alya::: Yep, but it's all good.Come on, BFF, let's take a ride on the coleslaw!
Marinette::: Please tell me I didn't say that!
Mylène::: Yeah!
