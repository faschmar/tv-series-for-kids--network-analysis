Cat Noir::: I don't call the shots, m'lady. You're the superhero who captures the evil akumas— I'm just the cunning, ultra-charming Cat Noir.
Ladybug::: Right, you have it easy.
Cat Noir::: Easy? That's 'cause I make it look easy.
Ladybug::: As cunning as you might be, that little prank you pulled earlier almost made my Lucky Charm fail!
Cat Noir::: D'you know why Master Fu gave you the Ladybug Miraculous instead of me?
Ladybug::: Because it requires someone with a sense of responsibility?
Cat Noir::: No, because you don't have a sense of humor.
Ladybug::: Pfft, whatever.Ah! 
Cat Noir::: Uh... Look, it's no big deal! You have so many other great qualities! I'm just in charge of the humor department. 
Ladybug::: You'd better get going before you lose your clown costume.
Cat Noir::: Miss you already, Bugaboo.
Ladybug::: Don't call me—!
Cat Noir:::See? I was right! 
Luka::: Don't you wanna be a model anymore?
Juleka::: Yeah, but... no one's ever going to pick me.
Luka:::Have you tried talking to Marinette about your idea?
Juleka::: I don't want to bother her with that.
Luka:::You're really pretty, Jule. I'm sure Marinette would love to have you as her model.You gotta follow your dreams in life. Don't let 'em pass you by. You were made for this.Go for it.
Marinette::: Since Ms. Mendeleiev wasn't in today, what should we do now that we're out an hour early?
Alya::: We should use this extra time to make that video for Marinette's soon-to-be website!
Rose, Alix, & Mylène::: Yeah, good idea!
Alya::: Remember I asked you guys to think about modeling Marinette's designs? Well, any takers?
Juleka:::I... I'd like to do it. 
Marinette::: Juleka?
Mylène::: I've never seen the top half of your face before!
Rose::: It really suits you!
Juleka:::Well, it's just a barrette. I mean I just, uh...
Alya::: We've got our model! 
Marinette::: Aah!
Alya::: Hey! We're gonna need a technical directer. Someone who knows his way around fashion shoots...? 
Marinette::: Don't even think about it! If he's right there in my house, in my room, I'll be a complete mess! 
Alya::: No, you won't! You'll be in your element. It's the perfect opportunity for you guys to get close!
Marinette::: No, I—Alya, no! 
Alya:::I was wondering if you could help us out with a fashion shoot.
Adrien::: I'd love to Alya, but I have to get home or else my father...
Alya::: I know, but you were supposed to be in Ms. Mendeleiev's class today, and since she's not here, you technically don't have to be home for another, entire hour. Your dad won't know any different!
Nino::: She's got a point, dude.
Adrien::: Oh! Okay then. 
Marinette::: Ah, no...! 
Alya:::Psst! This is totally your chance to ask him to the movies! 
Adrien::: Alix, could you shine the light a bit more on Juleka's shoulders, please? I want her to stand out.Does that work for you, Marinette?
Marinette::: Huh? Uh, sure! You're perfect— I mean, it's perfect!
Adrien:::This one! It'll compliment the suit really well.
Marinette::: I thought the same thing, Madrien, ah—!Adrien! 
Alya::: How about a little smile for the camera, Juleka?
Juleka:::Uh, I don't think this is such a good idea, you guys, I...
Marinette::: Is something wrong?
Juleka:::I'm just not feeling that—
Marinette::: You know, it was really cool of you to agree to be my model,but I can tell you're not feeling that comfortable about it at all.
Alya::: Decide fast, because we have less than an hour before Adrien has to leave.
Adrien::: That's okay, maybe we can do it again some other day, if my father lets me.
Marinette:::Would you prefer if someone stand in for you?This is something I should do myself, after all. These are my designs, and—
Alya::: Of course! Awesome idea, Marinette! The coolest thing about your designs is that they work just as well with guys, as with girls. A guy? A girl? Same suits? What do you think Adrien, are you in?
Adrien::: If it helps.
Alya::: See? This is gonna be awesome! Give Marinette your suit, Juleka— and Marinette, grab another suit for Adrien!Here are your accessories, created by the one and only Marinette Dupain-Cheng!Just bought you some extra time to ask him out! You're welcome.
Marinette::: I— I... 
Tikki::: Don't do that, Marinette!
Marinette::: It won't be for long, Tikki. Besides, you'll hold onto them for me. 
Adrien::: It won't be for long, Plagg. Besides, you'll be nearby. 
Rose:::Oh! 
Mylène::: Wow!
Rose::: You look so beautiful!
Alix::: It's uber perfect!
Alya::: Looks like we're ready!
Mylène::: Are you okay, Marinette? 
Marinette::: Yeah, he's too hot— I mean! I'm overheating in here, aren't you?
Alya::: Okay! Change of plans, we're gonna take the shoot outside! 
Rose::: I love the outside!
Adrien:::Heeey!
Alix::: C'mon, let's go! 
Alya::: A new environment, it'll be easier to breathe outside— You can do it. 
Rose:::What's the matter, Juleka?
Juleka::: I... I'd rather not come.
Marinette::: Wha...? Why not?
Juleka::: Nothing! I...
Rose::: I'll stay with you.
Juleka::: No, don't worry. Please go. Just tired, and need to study, and...
Marinette::: Are you sure?
Alya:::Girls! We've only got thirty minutes left!
Marinette:::Okay, then. Make yourself at home.
Rose::: See you in a bit. Mwah! 
Juleka:::I was so lame. I ruined everything. As usual.
Hawk Moth::: Yet again, my young prey fails to be the center of attention.Nathalie, I need Mayura to give this negative emotion a new dimension. 
Nathalie::: Duusu, spread my feathers!
Hawk Moth:::Fly away, little akuma, and evilize her!
Mayura:::Fly away, beautiful amok, and enhance and hone that frustration!
Alya::: To the Eiffel Tower, please!
Adrien::: Thanks for coming to fetch us.
The Gorilla::: 
Adrien::: We've got a little time before school's officially over!Doing this to help my friends out.
The girls::: Please!
The Gorilla::: 
Hawk Moth:::Reflekta, I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you the power to make people look just like you again, so that everyone will notice you.
Mayura::: Reflekta, I am Mayura. To help you succeed you'll be assisted by Reflekdoll. She'll be entirely under your control.
Hawk Moth::: And in return, of course, you must get hold of Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.
Juleka::: Hawk Moth, Mayura, you can count on me. I will succeed this time. 
Citizen 1::: Ah!
Citizen 2::: What is it?
Citizen 3::: What's that?
Citizen 4::: Ah!
Reflekta::: Heh, heh, heh! Hah!Yah! Hah! 
Alix & Adrien:::Huh? 
Reflekta:::Believe, my friends, you're the very people I've been looking for! I've got something special for your video!I'm gonna show you what it feels like to be me! 
Rose::: I'm sorry, Juleka! I should've stayed with you!
Reflekta::: Juleka's no more! I am Reflekta! Everyone always forgets about Juleka, anyway. 
Marinette::: Tikki, spots on!Tikki! Oh no!
Adrien::: Plagg, claws out! Uh—Plagg?
Plagg:::This is our lucky day, Sugarcube. A miracle in the making!Now we can enjoy a nice, aged snack while we wait for them to finish their little film. 
Tikki::: Eww.
Adrien::: Hide in the car!
Marinette::: What about you?
Adrien::: I'll uh...
Reflekta:::Marinette! You stole my limelight. I was supposed to be the star of the film!
Marinette::: But, you told me you didn't want to be!
Reflekta::: You didn't let me explain!Perhaps you'll understand me better now that you're in my shoes!Nobody can escape me! 
Tikki & Plagg::: 
Tikki:::Oh no, this is terrible, Plagg! How're we gonna be able to find our owners? Everybody looks exactly the same!
Plagg::: We have to find their Miraculouses, first! 
Tikki::: Paris is doomed without Ladybug and Cat Noir!
Plagg::: Got it!Stay focused, Sugarcube, everything will be all right! 
Reflekta:::Rose!! Where are you, my BFF!? Come to me, we'll be like twin sisters forever and ever!There you are! 
Plagg:::Cat Noir? Cat Noir! Cat Noir? 
Marinette::: Plagg?
Plagg::: Eh! You're not— 
Marinette::: What are you doing here? Has Cat Noir lost his Miraculous? Have you seen Tikki?
Plagg::: It's a long story, Marinette, uh—
Marinette:::Whatever, there's no time!
Marinette::: Plagg, claws out!
Tikki:::Yes!Ah!
Adrien::: Plagg! Plagg!
Lady Noire:::Ahh!
Adrien::: Oh?
Tikki::: Oh... Marinette!
Adrien::: Plaaagg! Plagg!
Tikki::: You are Cat Noir, correct?
Adrien:::Mmhmm. And that over there is... Ladybug?
Tikki::: There's been a little mix up with the Miraculous. I'm Tikki, pleased to meet you!
Adrien:::Hm! Well...!
Adrien::: Tikki, spots on!
Lady Noire::: Ah! Ah! Ah!
Mister Bug::: Well, M'Lady Noire, it looks like you're playing the easy part today!
Lady Noire::: Not so sure about that!Looks like we'll be taking on two opponents with each other's power!
Lady Noire & Mister Bug:::Ah!
Lady Noire::: Stay focused, Mister Bug. Use the yo-yo as a shield!
Mister Bug:::Yoww!
Hawk Moth::: They've swapped their Miraculouses!
Mayura::: And they're struggling with their new powers. 
Hawk Moth::: Make the most of it, Reflekta, their Miraculouses are within your reach!
Reflekta::: Yes, Hawk Moth!
Mister Bug::: Just my luck, I'm gonna have to capture two akumas instead of one!
Lady Noire::: No! One akuma, and one amok! 
Mister Bug::: Ahh! 
Lady Noire::: Reflekta has been reakumatized by Hawk Moth, but that giant doll of hers is a sentimonster, created by the owner of the Peacock Miraculous!Hah! 
Mister Bug:::Hah!Okay, so we have to find Reflekta's akumatized object, and the baby monster's amok! 
Lady Noire::: Can you manage, or should we switch back?
Mister Bug::: C'mon, I'm totally capable of doin' it. I just need to use my Lucky—!
Lady Noire:::No, wait!
Mister Bug::: Why'd you do that?
Lady Noire::: Because it's too early. You don't know enough about your opponent yet!
Mister Bug:::Watch out!
Lady Noire::: Ah!
Mister Bug::: It's Reflekta controlling a giant doll! 
Lady Noire:::But you don't know where the akuma and amok are hiding!
Mister Bug::: The akuma's probably in the same place as the first time we fought her— in her bracelet! 
Lady Noire::: Maybe! We're gonna have to check that.
Mister Bug::: If I could just get my hands on a mirror, I'd be able to reflect her own beam back at her! 
Lady Noire::: That's not how it works!The Lucky Charm doesn't just give you what you want.
Mister Bug::: We'll see about that. Watch and learn! Lucky Charm!A mirror!
Lady Noire:::Beginner's luck!
Mister Bug::: You're just jealous of my mastery, that's all.
Lady Noire::: Hmph! 
Lady Noire:::Very effective, Mister Bug!
Mister Bug::: But, I thought...
Lady Noire::: May I remind you that the Lucky Charm doesn't just give you an object to defeat the villain with? You actually have to figure out exactly how to use it to win the battle! Using your head!Now that you've used up your Lucky Charm—you've only got a few minutes left— uh!Before you transform back, BugaBoy!
Mister Bug::: Why don't you try helping me instead of making fun of me!? 
Lady Noire::: Apparently, BugaBoy doesn't have a sense of humor.
Mister Bug:::Sounds like you're wearing the clown costume now!
Lady Noire:::You bet! I'm the cunning, funny, and ultra-charming Lady Noire! Watch and learn. Cataclysm! 
Reflekta:::Whoaah!What's happening?
Lady Noire::: You think that's normal?
Mister Bug::: Dunno, I've never cataclysmed a sentimonster before.It's as if the Cataclysm was like a bee sting on a bull! It riled it up without actually wounding it! 
Lady Noire::: We don't have much time left before we transform back! 
Mister Bug::: And we still don't know where the amok's hidden.
Reflekta:::No, Reflekdoll! Stop! She-Cat Noir!? Bug Boy!? Help me!
Lady Noire::: So, you like playing with dolls? 
Mister Bug::: Hey! You stole my line! 
Mayura::: Should I retrieve the amok?
Hawk Moth::: No, definitely not. Chaos can prove a good ally.
Lady Noire::: Hah! 
Reflekta:::Whoa!These costumes look ridiculous on you, I'm going to redo your wardrobe! 
Mister Bug::: You could at least show a bit of gratitude!Besides, I think we look pretty good in these costumes.
Lady Noire::: Don't forget to capture the akuma.
Mister Bug::: I've always wanted to do this!Playtime's over little akuma. Time to de-evillize!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little butterfly.Oh well, whatever. I'll just fix everything back up, anyway. Mira—!
Lady Noire:::You might wanna stop Reflekdoll from destroying anything else before we go around repairing everything.Haaah!
Mister Bug:::Okay, I admit it. It's not easy being a super Ladybug.
Lady Noire:::And I admit that I like wearing your costume. It's a lot lighter on the shoulders. 
Mister Bug::: I'll never be able to do this without you, m'lady.
Lady Noire::: Reflekta was controlling the doll from inside its eye. We're gonna have to get inside there and find the object containing the amok!
Mister Bug::: But... how can we do that without getting hit by its beam? 
Lady Noire::: Why don't we just figure out how to use this mirror? You're a simple, straightforward guy...
Mister Bug::: Thanks for the 'simple' part.
Lady Noire::: While I always tend to come up with convoluted plans.
Mister Bug::: Not to say, surreal.
Lady Noire::: Of course! Simple and straightforward!That access panel on the back of its head, that's how we're gonna get in. And all we need is a...
Mister Bug::: A screwdriver!
Lady Noire::: Or a coin! 
Mister Bug::: That's right! Or something big and round like a coin!
Lady Noire::: Mmhmm. 
Mister Bug::: I would've just asked for a huge coin if I'd known.
Lady Noire::: Sure, but you can never know in advance.The stick shift is a hair clip!
Mister Bug::: You're the best, m'lady!Time to de-evillize!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little feather.Miraculous Mister Bug! 
Lady Noire & Mister Bug:::Pound it!
Hawk Moth:::We failed yet again!
Mayura:::But there are two of us now. We're much stronger, and we will win in the end. Duusu, fall my feathers. 
Hawk Moth::: Nooroo, dark wings fall. 
Duusu::: Yahoo! 
Nooroo::: Ah!
Duusu::: That was awesome! Huh?No, it wasn't awesome at all.Ohh, ohh— are you okay, Ms. Nathalie?
Gabriel::: Everything's fine. She's just... tired.
Duusu::: Yahoooo!
Gabriel::: Nathalie needs peace and quiet. Duusu, let her rest.
Duusu::: Yes, of course. Sorry.
Mister Bug::: Honestly, I understand why you never have any time to make jokes, m'lady.
Lady Noire::: We both have our roles, huh BugaBoy? 
Mister Bug::: Spots off! 
Adrien::: See you again, soon, Tikki.
Tikki::: Goodbye, Adrien! 
Lady Noire::: Claws in! 
Marinette::: Bye-bye, Plagg.That was really awesome!
Plagg:::Sure was! No better way to escape the boredom of daily life! 
Adrien::: You can count on me, Plagg. I'll never take off my miraculous again!I'm not cut out to be Ladybug, that's for sure!
Marinette:::Aww,I was so afraid I'd lost you forever, Tikki!I'm so happy to have you back! 
Marinette:::Girls! 
Alya::: Are you okay?
Marinette::: I'm so sorry, Juleka, I should've realized how important the shoot was for you. Do you want to give another try? 
Juleka::: Yeah, totally!Awesome.
The Gorilla::: 
Marinette::: Do you still have anytime left, Adrien?
Adrien:::It's important.
The Gorilla:::Mmm.
The girls::: Please? Please?
The Gorilla:::Hmm?Hmm.
The girls::: Yeah! Yay!
