{{Scene|Scene: [[Adrien's room]]. [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] is talking to [[Wayhem]] through a video chat.}}
<poem>
'''[[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]]''': I'm really sorry, Wayhem, but I've got a casting this afternoon and then a private fencing lesson. ''(notices Wayhem tearing up)'' But we will hang out soon. You're my number one fan after all. ''(Wayhem dries his tears)'' My [[Gabriel Agreste|father]] never lets me hang out. I never have friends over, either. 
'''[[Wayhem]]''': Seriously? You never have friends over? ''(Adrien shake his head)'' That's harsh. One of these days, I'm gonna come over and change your dad's mind and we'll have a rocking good time. For real!
'''Adrien''': My father doesn't change his mind very easily, but I appreciate the thought. Okay, gotta go finish my homework before the shoot. See you, Wayhem.
'''Wayhem''': Bye, Adrien. ''(hangs up)''
'''[[Plagg]]''': Why don't you make the most of your father being out of town? Have some friends over and live it up a little. 
'''Adrien''': You know my father has very high expectations of me. I can't go behind his back like that. Besides, even if I wanted to live it up a little, my [[Adrien's bodyguard|bodyguard]]'s keeping an eye on me and making sure I stay in line.
'''Plagg''': That's okay, you've got me. And our endless supply of cheese. That'll make anyone happy.

{{Scene|Scene: Agreste car. [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Nathalie]] notices the hologram of Gabriel flickering and adjusts it. She then picks up a call from Gabriel.}}
<poem>
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel]]''': ''(on speaker)'' Is everything going to plan, Nathalie?
'''[[Nathalie Sancoeur|Nathalie]]''': Yes. On route to the airport, sir. You will officially be spending the entire weekend in Tokyo. No one will ever suspect that you stayed home.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Gabriel's atelier]].}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': Perfect. ''(hangs up and then presses the buttons on his [[Painting of Emilie Agreste|painting]], leading down to his [[Agreste mansion#Unknown repository|repository]])'' [[Emilie Agreste|Emilie]], we miss you so much. But you'll be back with us very soon. Thanks to my [[akuma]]s, it's only a matter of time before I take control of their [[Miraculouses|Miraculous]]. Merging them will grant me absolute power to reshape reality, and finally reverse our past mistake. ''(notices white butterflies emerging from their cocoons)'' They're ready. [[Nooroo]], time to harvest. ''(collects the butterflies)''

<poem>
'''[[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]]''': Okay, remember our objective. To penetrate the impenetrable fortress, aka Adrien's pad. Our main obstacle, Adrien's old man, is headed for Tokyo's fashion week along with [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Obstacle #2]]. As for [[Adrien's bodyguard|Obstacle #3]], we have our own secret weapon to neutralize him. ''([[Max Kanté|Max]] taps his bookbag)'' Operation Adrien begins now!
'''[[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]]''': Uh... now now?
'''Nino''': Yeah, now now! What now?
'''Ivan''': Uh, now now is when I promised [[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]] I'd go help her plant some trees down by the [[Seine|river]].
'''[[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]]''': Wait a sec! The street thing's today?
'''[[Max Kanté|Max]]''': Yes, and the probability of the girls being terribly disappointed if we don't participate is 100%.
'''Nino''':  Which is why I already came up with official excuses for each of you. ''(hand everyone a piece of paper)'' Like you, Kim, have a swimming lesson.
'''Kim''': Great! I always have my trunks on me.
'''Nino''': Dude, you don't actually have a swimming lesson. That's just your excuse.
'''Ivan''': But isn't that lying?
'''Nino''': Sorry, but Max is right. The girls can't know about this. So, is this mission still on? For Adrien? ''(the guys look over their excuses)'' Guys? 
''(The boys all nod in agreement and begin texting the girls)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Seine]].}}
<poem>
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]''': ''(places a tree down)'' Hey, weren't the boys supposed to be here?
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]''': Nino was asked at the last minute to DJ his grandma's birthday party.
'''[[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]]''': Ivan suddenly got a toothache and rushed over to the dentist. 
'''[[Alix Kubdel|Alix]]''': [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Nathaniel]] crashed his computer and lost all the pages of the comic book he and [[Marc Anciel|Marc]] are doing. Max and [[Markov]] are helping them fix it.
'''[[Rose Lavillant|Rose]]''': Kim had to go to the pool for a mandatory swim lesson, though I'm not entirely sure why he texted ''me'' that.
'''Marinette''': ''(senses something is wrong, gasps)'' Oh! Uh... speaking of excuses, I- I- forgot that I was supposed to help my... [[Rolland Dupain|grandpa]] bake a cake for one of his mouse's birthday today. Sorry, Mylène. Catch you later, girls! ''(takes off)''
'''Alya''': Did I miss something, or is it bad excuses world championship today?
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outside the [[Agreste mansion]]. Nino rings the doorbell, and a camera comes out, with [[Adrien's bodyguard]] viewing them from it.}}
<poem>
'''Nino''': Hello. We’re here to see Adrien. We got to work on a school project together. ''(The camera unceremoniously goes back in. Nino chuckles mischievously, and rings the doorbell again. The camera returns.)'' Word is, you’re one of the biggest superhero figure collectors in the world. Is it true your collection is only missing a few pieces? Including this incredibly rare [[Olympia Hill|Majestia]] Millennium Edition? ''(Max shows the bodyguard the action figure)''
'''[[Adrien's bodyguard|Bodyguard]]''': ''(grunts in surprise)'' Mhuh?''(opens the mailbox)''
'''Nino''': ''(puts the figure inside)'' Here ya go! ''(The bodyguard opens the gate for them.)''
'''Boys''': Yeah! ''(high five and head towards the mansion)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Agreste mansion]]. Adrien’s bodyguard opens the door, looking around first before letting them in.}}
<poem>
'''Bodyguard''': ''(inquisitively)'' Hmm? Hmm? ''(nods at Nino and grunts affirmatively)'' Hmm.
'''Nino''': ''(entering the mansion)'' By the way, two more of Adrien’s buddies are gonna show up later and help with the project-! Whoa! ''(Adrien’s bodyguard shoves then back outside, Nino stops the door from closing with his foot.)'' Vintage [[Barbara Keynes|Knightowl]], 65th Anniversary Edition. ''(shows the action figure)''
'''Bodyguard''': ''(grunts excitedly, and lets them back in)'' 
'''Nino''': But if Marinette, [[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]], Rose, Alya, Alix, or Mylène come knocking at the door, don’t let them in. 'Kay? 
'''Bodyguard''': Hmph! ''(He grunts indignantly, opening the door threateningly, then chuckles with satisfaction as he gets a [[Jessica Keynes|Sparrow]] action figure)''
'''Max''': ''(to Nino)'' He sure strikes a hard bargain. ''(The Bodyguard leads them upstairs)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien’s room. Adrien types on his [[Adrien's computer|computer]] until the boys show up with the bodyguard.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': What are you guys doing here?
'''Nino''': We’re here for the school project.
'''Adrien''': Project? What project?
'''Nino''': You know. The project. ''(winks)''
'''Adrien''': Oh, that project! ''(Adrien’s bodyguard leaves)''
'''Boys''': Surprise project! ''(gather around Adrien)''
'''Nino''': You’ve never had any hang out time at your place, right?
'''Ivan''': We get to have it whenever we want.
'''Max''': So we’ve come up with a plan to right this injustice.
'''Adrien''': That’s really cool of you all. But my father would never allow this. It’d be best if you... ''(notices the guys’ disappointment)'' Uh, but hey! As long as it’s not for very long and he never, ever finds out about it...
'''Boys''': Hang out time! ''(look around Adrien’s room)''
'''Kim''': ''(heads inside Adrien’s bathroom)'' A jet stream bathtub! So glad I came prepared!
'''Ivan''': ''(slides down Adrien’s pole and plays with his foosball table)'' Dude, I’ve always wanted one of these in my room!
'''Max''': Is there any game you don’t have?
'''Nino''': Man, you’ve got the coolest stuff!
'''Adrien''': You ain’t seen nothing yet. ''(throws a basketball into his basketball hoop and his piano emerges from the ground)''
'''Boys''': Awesome!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Métro|Subway train]]}}
<poem>
'''[[Tikki]]''': Marinette, this isn’t the way to the [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|bakery]].
'''Marinette''': No, Tikki, I just said that so I could lead my investigation undisturbed. 
'''Tikki''': You lied to your friends...?
'''Marinette''': I didn’t want to upset Mylène. It was her idea to plant the trees this afternoon. But something totally fishy’s going on. All the boys are unavailable with really lame excuses, and trust me, I know a lame excuse when I hear them. I’ve turned into an expert at them since I became... you-know-who. ''(winks)'' I know, I’m gonna call Ivan. He can’t lie to save his life. If there’s something secret going on, he’ll definitely blab.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien’s room.}}
<poem>
'''Nino''': ''(commentates on the game foosball between Adrien and Ivan)'' Zitune to Platino, who dribbles and passes to Kili and the Kaki. Goal!
'''Adrien''': Yes! ''(he and Nino fist bump)''
'''Ivan''': ''(hears his phone ring)'' It’s Marinette!
'''Nino''': ''(takes the phone away)'' Don’t pick up! You can’t lie to save your life. If she finds out we’re here, you can say goodbye to guy time. ''(notices Adrien's [[Adrien's cellphone|phone]] ringing and snatches it)''
'''Max''': It’s Marine– ''(Nino takes away his phone along with Kim’s)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Subway train.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Proves my point. They’re all together. And I may have an idea of where they could be. ''(checks [[Marinette's cellphone|phone]])'' Adrien’s dad left town for Tokyo’s fashion week. While the cat’s away, the mice will play.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien’s room.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': Why can’t we just answer Marinette?
'''Nino''': Because… you don’t want to get distracted from your only chance to hang out with your guys.
'''Adrien''': But isn’t Marinette... one of my guys?
'''Nino''': Yes... but no. Right now, she’s with her guys, so we aren’t going to go and disturb her and her guys. Otherwise we wouldn’t be the good guys. Get it?
'''Adrien''': This whole guy thing’s super complicated.
'''Nino''': Okay... music! ''(Adrien opens one of his drawers)'' Woah! These can’t be your awesome old records.
'''Adrien''': They were my [[Emilie Agreste|mother's]].
''(Nino pulls out the record titled Stationation, blows off the dust, puts in into a record player, and turns the volume up on Adrien's [[Adrien's computer|computer]]; music plays from Adrien's speakers)''
'''Nino''': Uh, wait a sec. Is this as loud as it gets? Hey, Max and Markov! Can you do something to turn it up?
'''Max''': ''(gets on Adrien’s computer)'' Affirmative!
'''[[Markov]]''': I just need to hook to the home’s electrical panel. ''(plugs himself to Adrien’s computer)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outside the Agreste mansion. Marinette is getting out of the subway when she spots Nathaniel and Marc entering the mansion.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': I knew it!
'''Tikki''': Are you sure this is a good idea?
'''Marinette''': All the guys are together at Adrien’s place, so why can’t I be there too? I’ll just pretend I was passing by and, uh...
'''Tikki''': Yet another lie?
'''Marinette''': Just a half truth.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien’s room. The bodyguard lets Nathaniel and Marc inside.}}
<poem>
'''Ivan''': Hey, guys! ''(hugs Nathaniel and Marc)''
'''Max''': ''(to Adrien)'' Woah! Your house has an insane power supply, Adrien. It could compete with a nuclear power station.
'''Adrien''': My father always has to own the biggest and the best.
'''Nino''': Cool! Give me the biggest and the best. ''(Max redirects all the power to the speakers, increasing the volume so much that it knocks away Marinette, who was about to ring the doorbell, and several cars)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Gabriel's repository. Gabriel continues collecting butterflies until he notices the power go out. Frantic, he rushes to the elevator and goes up until it stops working.}}

</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Music loudly plays from the speakers.}}

'''Nino''': Are you kidding? This is the way it's supposed to be for guy time!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outside the Agreste mansion. [[Roger Raincomprix|Officer Roger]] angrily rings the doorbell and is let inside.}}

</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Officer Roger enters the scene with Adrien's bodyguard.}}
<poem>
'''Roger''': ''(blows his whistle, the music stops)'' What's all this racket about? ''(Max gives the bodyguard a [[Mercury]] action figure and he leaves)''
'''Max''': Uh...
'''Adrien''': Sorry, officer. We're just doing...
'''Nino''': ...a school project! We're working on a school project!
'''Roger''': What's the topic? Eardrum damage?
'''Nino''': No, it's, uh, on foosball. ''(points to the foosball table)''
'''Roger''': Seriously? ''(approaches the foosball table)'' You're doing it all wrong! Let me show you how it's done. ''(plays foosball)'' Caset! To Baliage! Goal!
'''Boys''': Woah!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outside the Agreste mansion. [[Thomas Astruc (character)|Thomas]]

<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(indignant)'' Why are all the guys allowed in and I'm not? ''(angrily walks away)'' Guys! Guys? Guys! Of course! ''(runs to a nearby trash bin and grabs a helmet and other materials)''
'''[[Armand D'Argencourt|Mr. D'Argencourt]]''': Tell your young master his fencing instructor awaits, wretch. 
'''[[André Bourgeois|Mayor Bourgeois]]''': ''(with makeup on his face)'' Can I rest here for a few hours? Until my daughter's makeup frenzy has passed?
'''[[André]]''': Bonjour! I received a call for a ice cream delivery! 
'''[[Xavier Ramier|Mr. Ramier]]''': I'm sorry, I've lost a pigeon. I think I saw it fly into your backyard.
'''[[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]''': Daddykins! I'm not finished with you! Daddy!
'''[[Butler Jean]]''': ''(wearing makeup)'' Miss Bourgeois sent me here to looking for her Daddykins. Would he be here by any chance?

'''Marinette''': ''(in a fake accent)'' Hi there! It's a-me: Marino! Your neighbor! I heard there was a party going on here, a guy's-only, so I'd like to come-a too, because, uh, I'm a guy. Heh! In fact, it's hard for me to walk with all these guy muscles of mine. Hehe! ''(The gate opens. She cheers in her normal voice)'' Aha! ''(goes back to her fake accent)'' I mean, hoo hoo! ''(walks inside and into Adrien's room)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Marinette is surprised when she bumps into [[Wang Fu|Master Fu]], who is sitting on top of a cooler.}}

'''Marinette''': Master Fu?
'''[[Wang Fu|Master Fu]]''': ''(not recognizing Marinette)'' Who, me? No, not at all. I'm DJ Wong! Ooh, ooh! Wiki, wiki, waa!
'''Marinette''': ''(leans towards him and takes off her glasses)'' Master, it's me: Marinette.
'''Master Fu''': Marinette?
'''Marinette''': What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be extra careful? ''(winks)'' You know, keeping the Miraculous hidden so Hawk Moth won't find them?
'''Master Fu''': Don't worry, Marinette. The Miraculous are cool. ''(taps his cooler)''
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': ''(notices Adrien’s record)'' Ah, Stationation. Takes me back to my youth.
'''André''': We could do the Holiday-a Camp dance!
'''[[List of minor characters/Humans#Hessenpy|Hessenpy]]''': No, we can’t.
'''Roger''': Why not, Captain Hessenpy?
'''[[List of minor characters/Humans#Jean Tretiens|Jean]]''': Nothing dangerous about that.
'''Hessenpy''': No, look! We’ve got the butler, the ice cream man, the policeman, the janitor, and I can do the fireman, but we’re missing...
'''All''': ...The Mustachio'd Biker. ''(sigh)''
'''Adrien''': Gentleman, I think you’ll be able to dance after all. ''(shows “Marino”)''
'''All''': The Mustachio'd Biker! ''(begin dancing to Stationation's 'Holiday Camp' while Marinette awkwardly attempts to follow along)'' 

Stationation:
♫ Hey come and join us at the holiday camp,

we love to go to the holiday camp,

and we don t care if you a saint or a scamp,

we are looking forward to the dance of the champ. ♫

'''Master Fu''': ''(dancing with Kim)'' I like your style! Whoa... whoa! ''(almost falls off the cooler he's dancing on but is caught by Kim)'' 
'''Kim''': Look out, sir!
'''Master Fu''': Thank you, young man. Your natural reflexes are quite good.

<poem>
'''Bodyguard''': ''(playing with his figures)'' Brrrrm. ''(Wayhem tries calling Adrien)''
'''Adrien's voicemail''': This is Adrien's voicemail. Leave a message.
'''Wayhem''': ''(takes off his glasses)'' Not only are you allowed to have friends over, but apparently a huge party is no big deal, either. Why did you lie to me, Adrien? ''(starts crying)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Gabriel's repository. Hawk Moth senses Wayhem's sadness.}}

'''Cat Noir''': How'd he know exactly what I was gonna do?
'''Ladybug''': It must be his power. He can anticipate our moves. We're gonna have to figure out how to surprise him. [[Lucky Charm]]! ''(receives a cassette tape)'' An old cassette? ''(Party Crasher zaps at the duo, so they jump off the statue. Party Crasher reads Ladybug's movements and absorbs her.)''
'''Cat Noir''': NO! ''(prepares to go towards Party Crasher but is stopped by Master Fu)''

'''[[Xuppu]]''': I'm no plushie! My name's Xuppu, you nitwit! ''(blows a raspberry at him)''
'''Kim''': My name's not nitwit! My name's Kim! ''(he and Xuppu make faces at each other while Master Fu watches from afar)''
'''Master Fu''': I'm wondering if this was the smartest move after all.
'''Xuppu''': ''(while Kim puts on the Monkey Miraculous)'' Just say showtime already!

'''Ladybug''': Pegasus, teleport here and find something to play this. ''(shows him a map on her yo-yo)''
'''Pegasus''': ''(teleports to [[Rolland Dupain|Rolland Dupain's]] house and grabs an old radio)'' Pardon me, sir. I promise to return it after [[Paris]] is saved. ''(leaves, while Rolland is confused)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(puts the cassette in the radio)'' The only solution is to be so unpredictable that he can't read our dance steps. So... freak out! ''(The heroes dance towards Party Crasher in a bizarre manner while Stationation plays)''
'''Party Crasher''': What are you doing? It's nonsense! ''(The heroes manage to beat Party Crasher and Ladybug grabs his glasses)''
