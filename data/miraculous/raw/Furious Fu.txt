{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. Marinette seems slightly panicked as she is trapped in the bedlam of [[Kwamis]] pleading and reasoning with her.}}
<poem>
'''[[Mullo]]:''' But we wanna...
'''[[Sass]] & [[Pollen]]:''' We all missed Master Fu... 
'''[[Xuppu]]:''' Hey! Let us visit him! Come on!
'''[[Fluff]]:''' Please!
'''[[Trixx]]:''' It's not fair!
'''[[Daizzi]]:''' Please!
'''Kwamis:''' Pleeeeeease!
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]:''' Uh... You know why you can't come. When he made me the new Guardian, his memory was magically erased. Now, [[Wang Fu|Master Fu]] is just like everyone else. He can't know about the [[Miraculouses|Miraculous]], my secret identity or you Kwamis! ''(She picks up [[Marinette's purse|her purse]])'' Come on, [[Tikki]]! Let's go.
''(The rest of the Kwamis, however, begin the argue with Marinette again.)''
'''Kwamis:''' That's not fair!
'''[[Ziggy]]:''' Why does Tikki get to go and not us?
'''Tikki:''' I'm sorry, friends, but you know I can't leave Marinette in case she needs to transform.
'''Trixx:''' But what if we hide too? Then he'd never see us! That'd be okay, right?
'''Daizzi:''' We just wanna make sure he's okay!
'''Xuppu:''' He took care of us for more than one hundred years, you know!
'''Marinette:''' I know! But you're gonna have to let him live his new life with his soulmate! It's my turn to take care of you.
'''[[Wayzz]]:''' Marinette, even so, you know Master Fu trusted me to help him protect the [[Chinese Miracle Box|Miracle Box]]. I was more than just his Kwami - I was his friend. And I miss him so much... ''(begins to sob)''
'''Marinette:''' I understand, but... ''(thinks deeply for a moment)'' Alright, you can come, Wayzz.
''(The kwamis erupt into another discordant argument with Marinette.)''
'''Mullo:''' Why?
'''Trixx:''' Not fair!
'''Ziggy:''' I wanna see him!
'''[[Roaar]]:''' I wanna go!
'''Marinette:''' I just can’t take all of you at once!''(The Kwamis start to sulk and question why.)''
'''Marinette:''' Because... because the Miracle Box has to be guarded; protected - that's why!
'''Trixx:''' So you're saying is if one of us stays here to keep watch... the rest of us can come, right?
'''Marinette:''' Huh? What?! Of course not!
''(Yet again, the kwamis argue.)''
'''Xuppu:''' But how do we choose who stays?
'''Sass:''' Let's let fate decide.
'''Xuppu and Daizzi:''' Yeah; let's do Kwami-Kwa-Who!
'''Marinette:''' Kwa-What?
'''Mullo:''' ''(randomly points at kwamis with each passing word)'' Kwami-kweeny-koomy-who, the special chosen one is ''(abruptly points at Marinette)'' YOU! There—Marinette stays!
''(The cheerful kwamis fly towards the window. Fortunately, Marinette runs in front of their way in the nick of time.)''
'''Marinette:''' Oh, no you don't! That's cheating! Besides, ''I'm'' the Guardian; I get to decide.
'''Mullo:''' Hmm, she leaves us no choice...
'''Xuppu:''' Operation Kwami Baby-Doll Eyes!
'''Marinette:''' Uh-
'''Kwamis:''' ''(enlarge their eyes to appear cuter)'' PLEEASE??!
'''Marinette:''' Uh... fine...  ''(She looks at each of the Kwamis, who are all pleading to go.)'' Huh. Any.. Kwami willing to volunteer?
'''[[Barkk]]:''' The kid has a point! ''(She is watching a movie on Marinette's computer, taking everyone else by surprise.)'' What if an [[Akumatized villains|akumatized villain]] or a [[Sentimonster]] shows up? I have a bad feeling about this. You go, I'll keep watch. ''(She then clicks the computer mouse to resume the film.)''
'''Blue Knight In Movie:''' En garde, my lord!
'''Marinette:''' Thank you, Barkk. ''(She picks up and opens her school bag.)'' Come on! Everyone inside! ''(All the Kwamis cheer as they fly inside.)'' But I'm warning you - not even a peep out of any of you. ''(After closing her bag, the Kwamis continue to cheer delightfully.)'' You're peeping! ''(The Kwamis still continue their celebration as Marinette puts the bag on her back and exits her room. Cut back to Barkk watching the movie.)''
'''Red Knight In Movie:''' By jove! We're not out of the woods yet, my lord!

{{Scene|Scene: Kitchen. Marinette grabs a picnic and runs to the train station.}}
{{Scene|Scene: [[Gare du Nord]]}}
<poem>
'''Roaar:''' Ready?
'''Kwamis:''' ''(singing) Dear Master Fu's on a ...'' ''(Marinette panics and looks in her backpack as civilians look at her weirdly, Marinette grabs her phone)''
'''Marinette:''' It's my phone. It started on its own again. ''(at her backpack)'' If it doesn't stop right now, I swear it's gonna end up in the trash! ''(Marinette throws her phone back in her backpack, civilians shrug and keep talking, [[Su-Han]] watches from a trash can and moves away.)'' 
''(A train pulls up and stops, Marinette sees [[Marianne Lenoir|Marianne]] and Wang Fu leave the train)''
'''Marinette:''' Hi, Marianne. ''(hugs Marianne)''
'''Marianne:''' Hello, Marinette. ''(turns back to Fu)'' Do you remember her, my love? She's the young girl who found you after your paddleboat accident. The one that caused your amnesia. ''(Fu smiles at Marinette, Marinette tearfully hugs him)''
'''Marinette:''' I'm so glad to see you again, Master... I mean, Mr. Fu.
'''Wang Fu:''' My dear child, you reunited me with my beloved Marianne. I can never thank you enough. ''(Marinette smiles at him)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: A bench in the [[Seine]]. Marinette hands out cakes to Fu, who then takes his cake and hands second cake to Marianne.}}
<poem>
'''Wang Fu:''' Yes, life in London has been quite wonderful.
'''Marianne:''' Would you believe it? Wang discovered a passion for painting. ''(Wayzz pokes out of the backpack)''
'''Wang Fu:''' Actually, as a thank you for helping me, I want to give you this painting. ''(hands Marinette a painting with a lot of scribbles)''
'''Marinette:''' Thank you. It's... really... Uh, am I holding it the right way?
'''Wang Fu:''' ''(laughs)'' Yes. I'm not sure myself what's supposed to represent. ''(Marinette sees Wayzz on the ground and panics, and tries to grab him)'' But when I think of you, this is what I see. So, there you go. ''(sees Wayzz and picks him up)'' What's this? ''(pokes Wayzz's head)'' That's such a cute little doll. Is it yours? ''(hands Wayzz to Marinette)''
'''Marinette:''' ''(laughs nervously)'' Yes! It probably fell out when I took out the cake. ''(put Wayzz into her backpack)''
'''Wayzz (from the backpack):''' ''(excitedly)'' HE TOUCHED ME! HE TOUCHED ME!
'''Marinette:''' ''(takes Wayzz out)'' I didn't show you! It talks too. ''(chuckles, imitates Wayzz)'' He touched me! He touched me! ''(puts Wayzz back, Su-Han looks from a box on a scooter)'' So, what are you going to do while you're visiting Paris?
'''Wang Fu:''' Paint, of course. ''(grabs his supplies)'' Montmarte, [[Jardin des Tuileries|the Tuileries gardens]], the banks of the Seine. Is there any better place to paint than Paris? ''(starts to paint)'' Go on. Don't mind me. ''(Marinette and Marianne chuckle)''
'''Marinette:''' Another slice of cake? ''(hands Marianne a piece)''
'''Marianne:''' Please. ''(painting of the scene appears)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room.  Marinette returns to her room.}}
<poem>
'''Roaar:''' He looked as strong as a tiger!
'''Xuppu:''' Unusual painting, though.
'''Daizzi:''' Is there still cake?
''(Kwamis leave her backpack, Marinette gets shocked by [[Su-Han]] holding the [[Chinese Miracle Box|Miracle Box]] and Barkk)''
'''Barkk:''' I told you I had a bad feeling about this. 
'''Su-Han:''' How come you are in possession of the Mother Box, young lady?
'''Marinette:''' ''(looks to the [[Marinette's sewing box|sewing box]] where the Miracle Box is usually kept, realizing it is empty)'' Who are you? 
'''Tikki:''' ''(flies)'' That's Grand Master Su-Han. The celestial guardian of the Miracle Box. 
'''Marinette:''' But I'm the guardian of the box. 
'''Tikki:''' Celestial Guardian was in charge of it before that [[Dormant Sentimonster|incident]] [[Feast|caused by Master Fu]]. ''(Barkk flies back to the other kwamis)''
'''Marinette:''' ''(angry and confused)'' How did you find me?
'''Su-Han:''' The [[guardians' staff]]s hold compasses that allow the boxes to be tracked at all times. 
'''Marinette:''' Hey! That's not fair! Why didn't I get a staff?
'''Su-Han:''' Precisely because you are ''not'' a true guardian! This is all a misunderstanding, and the incorrect shape of the box proves it.
'''Marinette:''' But I don't get it. Master Fu entrusted it to me.
'''Su-Han:''' FU?! As in Wang Fu, also known as Whiny Chicken Leg?! That incompetent disciple unable to spend one entire day without eating, or do a thousand finger push-ups?! Fu should never have been a guardian. That low-life never lived up to the hopes that were placed in him.
'''Marinette:''' Master Fu may have made mistakes when he was young, but he bravely protected the box for years! He even sacrificed himself and erased his own memory to save us! ''(shows him the painting)'' And now, he's become a great painter!
'''Su-Han:''' That old man is Whiny Chicken Leg?! Wait... ''(looks at the kwamis)'' Some kwamis are missing.
'''Marinette:''' When Master Fu gave the box, he already lost [[Nooroo]], [[Duusu]], and their Miraculous, the [[Butterfly Miraculous|butterfly]] and the [[Peacock Miraculous|peacock]]. ''(Su-Han gasps)''
'''Su-Han:''' ''(shocked)'' He's lost a Miraculous too?! ''(to himself; annoyed)'' He's even more incompetent than I thought. (''notices [[Plagg]] is missing'') PLAGG! Young girl, where is Plagg?!
'''Marinette:''' That I know. Cat Noir is his holder.
'''Su-Han:''' ''(suspiciously)'' And who is Cat Noir?
'''Marinette:''' Well... I don't know, since we're supposed to keep our identities secret.
''(Su-Han is confused until, he sees that Marinette is wearing the [[Ladybug Miraculous]]. Upset by this, Su-Han sits down and is angry about current situation.)''
'''Su-Han:''' So this is the modern world: protected by a group of careless fools. Guardians must never wear a Miraculous! Some jewels missing and Plagg roaming free?! The end of dinosaurs and dragons - doesn't that alarm anyone?! ''(grunts and slams his staff into the ground)'' That's enough! Kwamis, get in ying-yang patterns and back inside the box. ''(opens the box, the kwamis except for Tikki enter the box, disappointed.)''
'''Marinette:''' What are you doing?! ''(Su-Han closes the box, puts in his sack and takes out a book)''
'''Su-Han:''' Let me remind you about some of the Perfect Precepts that you have broken. ''(flips pages)'' Precept 14: ''Kwamis must not live outside the box.'' ''(flips pages)'' Precept 52: ''Guardians must never lose a Miraculous.'' ''(flips pages)'' Precept 133: ''A guardian cannot, under any circumstances, '''wear a Miraculous.''''' ''(closes the book)''
'''Marinette:''' But Master Fu wore one himself!
'''Su-Han:''' Precisely! That just proves what I've been saying all along! Neither you nor Fu were up to the role of Guardian, because neither of you have respected the ancient absolute rules of our order! Not to mention the fact that no child should be a keeper of kwamis! They are ultra-powerful cosmic entities! One must manage them with authority, which you are obviously incapable of doing! ''(looks at Marinette's computer)''
'''Blue Knight In Movie:''' En garde, my lord!
'''Su-Han:''' (''gets in fighting stance'') Challenging me like this is akin to pulling on the tiger's whiskers, you villain! ''(charges at the computer)''
'''Marinette:''' ''(stops him)'' Whoa! Easy there. Calm down! It's just a movie. See?
'''Su-Han:''' ''(amazed)'' Such a powerful spell! How did that warrior end up in this flat prison of glass and metal? (''knocks on the computer screen'') Anyway, we must waste no more time! Take me to Cat Noir, young lady.
'''Marinette:''' ''(to Tikki)'' Do you think this is a good idea?
'''Tikki:''' I don't know. It might be best to do as he says. After all, he is the Celestial Guardian.
'''Marinette:''' Oh, I guess you're right.
<center>'''''[Transformation Sequence]'''''<br />'''Marinette:''' ''(unhappily)'' Tikki, spots on! Ah! ''(Marinette transforms into Ladybug)''</center>
''(Ladybug calls Cat Noir on her phone)''
'''Su-Han:''' What are you doing to your [[Yo-yo|weapon]]?
'''Ladybug:''' Well, this is my Bug-Phone, to talk to Cat Noir.
'''Su-Han:''' ''(confused)'' You don't have to send doves to communicate with each other?
'''Red Knight In Movie:''' We are not out of the woods yet, my lord!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Parisian rooftops. Su-Han follows Ladybug to Cat Noir}}
<poem>
'''[[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]:''' Hello M'lady! Is this the wonderful guest you mentioned in your message?
''(Ladybug looks sadly at Su-Han)''
'''Su-Han:''' ''(frustrated)'' Of course, another child.
'''Ladybug:''' Cat Noir, this is-.
'''Su-Han:''' ''(interrupts)'' I am Grand-Master Su-Han, the Celestial Guardian of the Mother Box.
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(surprised)'' What? Aren't you supposed to be guardian M'lady?
'''Su-Han:''' ''(interrupts, shouting)'' When the lion speaks the cub listens! First off you two are going to hand over your Miraculous to me.
'''Cat Noir:''' What, that's a bad joke. ''(smiles with Ladybug)'' And I know all about bad jokes.
'''Ladybug:''' We can't do that! How are we going to defeat [[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]] without our Miraculous?
'''Su-Han:''' I will reassign then to carefully selected, appropriate adult holders. Like any rightful responsible Guardian would do.
'''Cat Noir:''' Wait a minute. We can't just give our Miraculous to some guy who just showed up out of the blue.
'''Ladybug:''' I..I don't know. The [[Kwamis]] confirmed that he's the real original guardian of the Box. Maybe Grand-Master Su-Han is right. Maybe Master Fu is wrong. ''(sadly)'' Maybe that's the reason why we can't defeat Shadow Moth.
'''Cat Noir:''' That's ridiculous! You'll always deliver! Trust yourself, Ladybug, like I trust you. If I have to give my Miraculous back then fine, I will. But only if you ask me to. You're the only Guardian here.
''(Ladybug looks sadly)''
'''Su-Han:''' Then it's settled. Order him to give you his Miraculous back and let's be done with this. Then you will renounce being the Guardian so I can retrieve the Mother Box.
'''Ladybug:''' But... if I do it, will my memories get erased like Master Fu's?
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(shocked and sad)'' Does that mean you won't remember ''me''?
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir both look down sadly. Unwilling to lose the one, whom he loves or losing precious memories with her, Cat Noir bravely defies Su-Han and prepares to fight.)''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(angrily)'' You want my [[Cat Miraculous|ring]]? Then come and get it!
'''Su-Han:''' Fine.
'''Ladybug:''' Cat Noir, calm down. That's a Guardian you're talking to. We're gonna find a solution. 
'''Su-Han:''' ''(does several Kung-Fu moves)'' Why do you think guardians study for so many years? Just to hand the Miraculous out to whomever? No. We are specially trained to overpower the Miraculous holders who have gone rogue, like YOU! ''(charges at Cat Noir)'' Celestial Storm! The thousand fists of the Yama bring in the bearings wiped out! ''(Su-Han starts using all of kung fu moves to make Cat Noir fall and roll over to a chimney. He then jumps on Cat Noir.)''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(weakly)'' Master Fu was way nicer.
'''Su-Han:''' And his Mira-Kung Fu was worse. ''(grabs Cat Noir's hand, and reaches for the ring)''
''(Ladybug throws her yo-yo at Su-Han's arm, flinging him backwards. Su-Han lands on a chimney cap.)''
'''Ladybug:''' Grand-Master, the last I heard, ''I'' was the Guardian! And I say that Cat Noir keeps his Miraculous, and I keep mine!
'''Su-Han:''' ''(Outraged)'' Insolent subordinate! ''(jumps down)'' Stream of Justice! Blows right down and murders the enemy armies! ''(throws Cat Noir)''
'''Ladybug:''' I don't know how he's doing it but he's guessing our every move in advance! ''(attempts to punch Su-Han, but he dodged; he throws her onto the floor)''
'''Su-Han:''' My Mira-Kung Fu is like water. It adapts and finds its way anywhere. And you are barely afloat at the mercy of the river current!
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir both get kicked into a wall by Su-Han)''
'''Ladybug:''' Cat Noir, grab his staff. ''(points at Su-Han with one hand, and holds her yo-yo in the other. She searches for the movie Barkk was watching.)''
'''Su-Han:''' The claws of the hungry cat, powerless against the milkman's iron box. ''(Ladybug throws her yo-yo beneath Su-Han and plays the video from earlier)''
'''Blue Knight In Movie:''' En garde, my lord!
'''Su-Han:''' Has the warrior escaped?
''(Ladybug snags Su-Han's sack)''
'''Ladybug:''' Got it!
'''Su-Han:''' What?
'''Cat Noir:''' Bye-bye! ''(kicks him into a wall)''
''(Cat Noir grabs his staff and Ladybug shatters the wall on Su-Han. He digs out, but Ladybug and Cat Noir are gone with his staff and the box)''
'''Su-Han:''' If you challenge the clouds, you will face the ''thunder''!

<poem>
'''Shadow Moth:''' I feel a mixture of mysterious emotions: a scorned authority, a confused man defeated, but most of all, an anger ready to explode! ''(turns a butterfly into an akuma)'' Fly away, my evil akuma, and let the lava of punishment erupt from his volcanic heart!

'''Su-Han:''' ''(harshly)'' Hand over your staff, Whiny Chicken Legs! You don't deserve it anyway. 
'''Wang Fu:''' ''(sternly)'' Have you lost your mind, young man?!
'''Marianne:''' Leave my partner alone! ''(whacks Su-Han with her cane several times)''
'''Su-Han:''' ''(sees akuma headed for him, gasps)'' An akuma! Whirlwind of wisdom! The virtuous wind resists the temptation! ''(begins meditating)'' My anger is mine but I am not my anger. My anger is mine but I am not my anger. ''(akuma flies off)'' Enough! Fool you're making me lose precious time! ''(aggressively grabs cane from Wang Fu, causing both Fu and Marianne to fall. He looks inside the cane, noticing a hidden staff, and starts to walks away)''
'''Wang Fu:''' Marianne, are you okay? ''(helps her up. Angry with Su-Han for pushing him and his wife, and upset with him for stealing his cane, Wang Fu puts the pencil to his ear and grabs a hold of the cane Su-Han took)'' Where do you think you're going? You apologize to my partner and give my cane back at once, you boar!

'''Wang Fu:''' Do I ever.
'''Shadow Moth:''' Then let's proceed. ''(Fu is akumatized into Furious Fu)''
'''Furious Fu:''' ''(to Marinanne)'' Which way did he go? 
'''Marinanne:''' My love please! It's not worth it.  
'''Furious Fu:''' That reckless toad will not spit in the dragon's face without apologizing! ''(takes out paint brush and writes the Chinese word 发现 (Fāxiàn))'' '''FIND!''' ''(paper flies off in the direction of Su-Han)''

{{Scene|Scene: [[Parc des Princes]]. Ladybug and Cat Noir discuss what to do with the Miracle Box. }}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' What do we do? Should we hide it? 
'''Ladybug:''' And then what? He knows who I am anyway. He knows where I live! 
'''Su-Han:''' Ladybug! Cat Noir! Give me back the Mother Box and your Miraculous! Return them to the right hands!
'''Ladybug:''' Hey, that's Master Fu's cane. 
'''Furious Fu:''' I want my cane and an apology! ''(writes 雷电 (Léidiàn) with his paintbrush)'' Thunderbolt! ''(paper goes into the sky and creates a dark cloud shooting red lightning, which Ladybug, Cat Noir, and Su-Han dodge)''
'''Su-Han:''' ''(tries to take the box from Ladybug)'' Give it! 
'''Ladybug:''' ''(holding onto box)'' Never! ''(A strike of lighting causes both Su-Han and Ladybug to drop the box onto the field; they run after it. Shadow Moth, through Furious Fu, notices Miracle Box and communicates Furious Fu and asks him to bring him the Miracle Box.)''
'''Shadow Moth:''' Furious Fu, bring me that box! ''(Furious Fu jumps down and starts after it, Ladybug and Cat Noir treat the box as a football, kicking it around on the field and playing keep away)''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(in an effort to keep the box far from Su-Han and Furious Fu, he kicks it into the goalpost)'' '''Gooaal!!''' ''(Everyone else still chasing after it)'' Hey! ''(starts running again)''
'''Furious Fu:''' ''(writes 瞬间移动 (Shùnjiān yídòng) with paintbrush)'' '''TELEPORTATION!''' ''(teleports and grabs the box. Su-Han retreats)''
'''Shadow Moth:''' One-zero, Ladybug. 
'''Ladybug:''' ''(accusingly)'' Red card! He touched the ball with his hands! ''(Cat Noir and Ladybug both attempt to retrieve it from him, but fail)''
'''Su-Han:''' ''(criticizing from off the field)'' No! Higher! Watch out! No, not like that! Ugh! So slow! Come on! Not that way! 
'''Cat Noir:''' Hey, Mr. Bossy Pants! Would it kill you to help us out here? 
'''Su-Han:''' ''(dismissively)'' Mirakung-Fu is a martial art designed to neutralize rebellious Miraculous holders! Not to fight super villians created through the magic of the Miraculous!
'''Ladybug:''' So ''we're'' supposed to fix ''your'' mistakes? !
'''Furious Fu:''' (''gesturing with his arms and hands'') Phantom Palms and the Awakened! The wise man moves mountains without touching them! ''(he sends Ladybug and Cat Noir back with a burst of energy. He points to Su-Han)'' You're next. 
'''Su-Han:''' ''(shouting fighting techniques)'' A hundred thousand dragon talons! The pagoda breaker iron feet! The rage of the sunscreen with ingrown nails! 
'''Furious Fu:''' ''(writes 雕像 (Diāoxiàng) with his paintbrush; places the paper of Su-Han's forehead)'' Statue. ''(As he said this, Su-Han stops like statue and Fu takes his cane back)'' Finally.
'''Shadow Moth:''' Well done Furious Fu.

{{Scene|Scene: Parc des Princes. Ladybug and Cat Noir talk about a plan just off the field. }}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' I am not a wingless bat! ''(about to start fighting again)''
'''Ladybug:''' Cat Noir, wait. We'll never defeat him.
'''Cat Noir:''' What? 
'''Ladybug:''' We just need ''him'' not to defeat ''us'' either.
'''Cat Noir:''' You lost me.
'''Ladybug:''' I have to make a call, cover me!  (''opens her Bug-Phone'')
'''Cat Noir:''' That I can do. 
(''Cat Noir jumps onto the field, swordfighting with his [[staff]] against Furious Fu, who parries with his cane.'')
'''Furious Fu:''' The kitten can meow all he wants, but he will never roar like a tiger!
'''Ladybug:''' (''finishes her call'') [[Lucky Charm]]! ''(receives bolt cutters, then looks around for what to do. She notices Cat Noir's ring, some footballs in a locked cage, her [[yo-yo]], and the bolt cutters)'' Perfect! 
'''Furious Fu:''' ''(notices Ladybug going to the cage)'' What is she up to? ''(kicks Cat Noir away, plants his staff on the ground, then writes 视力 (Shìlì) with his paintbrush)'' Vision! ''(sees the items Ladybug intends to use)'' Oh, so this is your silly little plan. I know what you gonna do. ''(starts heading for Ladybug)''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(stops Furious Fu by jumping on him from behind)'' We're not done yet! 
''(Ladybug uses the cutters to break a lock, then grabs a ball from the cage)'' 
'''Cat Noir:''' [[Cataclysm]]!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(reacting to Cat Noir)'' No!
'''Furious Fu:''' ''(grabs Cat Noir, takes his activated hand, and threatens to cataclysm him with it)'' You're going to turn yourself into cat food. 
'''Ladybug:''' ''(sends her yo-yo at Furious Fu)'' Take this! ''(Furious Fu catches the string between his teeth)'' And that. ''(Furious Fu catches Ladybug, holding her up by one arm. With her other arm, she puts the Football between her legs and then wedges it between Cat Noir's activated cataclysm and his chest)'' There! Voila! We win! 
'''Furious Fu:''' ''(while still holding the yoyo string between his teeth)'' Win? You foolish beetle, we're just stuck now! I can't defeat you but you can't defeat me either!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(confidently)'' Oh but my plan was never to defeat you myself.
'''Marianne:''' Sorry, I need to borrow that. ''(takes the paintbrush off Furious Fu's ear and breaks it)'' There. Exactly like you said on the phone, Ladybug. ''(Furious Fu drops both Ladybug and Cat Noir as he is deakumatized)''
'''Ladybug:''' Thank you Marianne, that was perfect. (''opens her yo-yo'') No more evil doing for you little akuma. Time to de-evilize! (''catches the akuma'') Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly! (''throws the bolt cutters into the air'') [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]! (''the storm clears and Su-Han is unfrozen'')
'''Ladybug, Cat Noir, and Marianne:''' Pound i- 
'''Cat Noir:''' Whoops, sorry! ''(realizing his cataclysm is still active, he bends down to use it on the ball)''
'''Ladybug, Cat Noir and Marianne:''' ''(they, along with Marianne, fist bump)'' Pound it.
'''Ladybug:''' ''(Ladybug takes a [[Magical Charms|magical charm]] out of her yo-yo and hands it to Fu)'' Here, carry this with you at all times. It will protect you from future attacks. 
'''Wang Fu:''' And it will remind me of you everyday. Thank you Lady Beetle and Mr. Bat. ''(Ladybug laughs)''
'''Su-Han:''' ''(to Wang Fu; awkwardly, but sincerely)'' I'm terribly sorry. Forgive me Whiny- uh Sir. I- I mistook you for someone who has been long gone. (''returns Wang Fu's cane'')
'''Wang Fu:''' ''(reclaims his cane)'' Don't worry about it, it's already forgotten.

'''Wang Fu:''' The bat and the red beetle were incredible! Paris is always filled with good people ready to devote themselves for the greater good. Like you, Marinette.
'''Marinette:''' You should really thank Marianne, you know. From what I heard, she was the true superhero of the day.

'''Su-Han:''' ''(upset)'' Involving Marianne in the fight - a human without powers was against the precepts too. ''(Marinette looks down, saddened)'' This has proven two things: the first thing is that you have the audacity to invent your own rules, and, as crazy as it may seem, somehow they all work. ''(Marinette is surprised)'' The second thing is that your natural instincts tell you who you can trust - an essential quality for a guardian. Whiny Chicken- uh, sorry.. Master Fu may not have made such a bad choice after all. ''(Marinette smiles)'' The Miracle Box is the mother of all boxes. It's the very first one that was created, and the one that holds the most powerful magic jewels. I cannot imagine what would happen if it were to fall into the wrong hands. But I am going to trust you. ''(hands Marinette the box, she takes it happily)'' I will keep watching you from a distance, but be wary - one failure and I will take the Miracle Box back. ''(Marinette nods as she walks over to her special hiding place for the box, inputs the code, and sets it inside)'' I will make the most of my time here in Paris to get accustomed to modern life. How can I be a good guardian if I don't try to understand the world around me? 
'''Marinette:''' Thank you, Master. I have something for you too. I think you're gonna need these. ''(She holds up a new pair of shoes, causing Su-Han to look down at his old and worn out pair. Marinette and Su-Han share laugh.)''
