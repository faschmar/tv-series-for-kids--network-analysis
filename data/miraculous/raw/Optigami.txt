''{{Scene|Scene: [[Agreste mansion|Agreste Mansion]]. [[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel]] and [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Nathalie]] are discussing matters in [[Nathalie's room|Nathalie's bedroom]].}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': This is what we learned, thanks to the akumatization of [[Chloé Bourgeois]] as Miracle Queen.
''([[Optigami (sentimonster)|Optigami]] flies nearby as Nathalie shows Gabriel the true identities of [[Alya Césaire|Rena Rouge]], Queen Bee, [[Kagami Tsurugi|Ryuko]], [[Lê Chiến Kim|King Monkey]], [[Luka Couffaine|Viperion]], [[Max Kanté|Pegasus]] and [[Nino Lahiffe|Carapace]] on her screen.)''
'''Gabriel''': Yes... I remember...
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Trocadéro]]. A scene from "[[Miracle Queen (The Battle of the Miraculous - Part 2)|Miracle Queen]]" plays.}}
<poem>
'''Miracle Queen''': People of Paris, listen to Miracle Queen's first order! From now on, no one will have to keep his identity a secret. All the Miraculous wearers, come to me!
''(Under the control of Miracle Queen, Alya, Nino, Max, Luka, Kagami and Kim walks towards Miracle Queen.)''
'''Hawk Moth''': ''(excitedly)'' Yes! Yes!!! No more hiding!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Agreste Mansion, Present.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': Since then, ''(Optigami files and lands on Nathalie's finger)'' I created Optigami.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair|Shadow Moth's Lair]]. Mayura charges a feather in her hand.}}
<poem>
'''Mayura''': My beautiful [[amok]], bring my creation to life! ''(puts the amok in her tablet. She concentrates her power and creates the [[sentimonster]] Optigami, which flies onto her finger)'' Optigami, I am Mayura. ''(Optigami opens its eyes, then flies out)'' Be my eyes and discover all of [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug's]] secrets.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Streets. Optigami flies into a the yellow light of a traffic light, and opens its eyes to spy on Luka delivering a pizza.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': Under my control, Optigami followed each of the Miraculous holders. Alas, they're just ordinary teenagers-
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Swimming pool]]. Optigami flies into a lifeguard's chair, and opens its eyes to spy on Kim, who is happily swimming.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': ''(continued)'' –who spend their time between school and extracurricular activities.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Art classroom]]. Optigami flies into a statue's head, and opens its eyes to spy on [[Max Kanté|Max]], who is playing chess with [[Markov]].}}
{{Scene|Scene: Hawk Moth's Lair. Mayura watches what Optigami sees through her tablet, which displays [[Kagami Tsurugi|Kagami]] fencing.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': ''(continued)'' True, Ladybug sometimes trusts them with a Miraculous. 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Streets. Scenes from "[[Mega Leech]]" through Optigami's point of view in which Ladybug gives Miraculous to Max and Kagami, as well as Nino giving back his Miraculous, and her covertly going into the sewers, all play.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': ''(continued)'' But she's established rules that prevent anyone from discovering her secret identity: she never shows her face, always takes back the Miraculous, and makes sure no one ever follows her.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Sewers. Optigami flies around searching for Ladybug.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': ''(continued)'' Even Optigami couldn't stay on her tail.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Nathalie's room, back in present day.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': We will learn nothing more with the Sentimonster.
'''Gabriel''': On the contrary, I believe that it will help us finally discover who is behind Ladybug's mask. There's a flaw when the holder gives their miraculous back. ''(Pointing at the video of Nino giving his Miraculous back to Ladybug)'' There. Imagine if Optigami was hiding in the Miraculous ladybug took back it would lead us straight to her home, unknowingly.
'''Nathalie''': Brilliant. But how do you plan to do that?
'''Gabriel''': I need an event where all the holders will be sure to come, and a super-villain will force ladybug to assign a Miraculous if she wants to defeat it. And I know just the right person for it.
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: [[Tour Montparnasse]]. [[Audrey Bourgeois|Audrey]] is insulting an employee.}}
<poem>
'''Audrey''': Are you serious?! Where is the glitter that I asked for? You're useless, utterly useless. ''(her phone rings)'' Shoo, shoo!
</poem>
''(Audrey picks up her phone after hearing it ringing.)''
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': Audrey, once again this idea was formidable.
'''Audrey''': Utterly formidable, you mean! ... What was the idea again?
'''Gabriel''': This new award by your magazine, the Fashion Icon of the Month, and I was thinking, what better way to launch the award than by electing my son?
'''Audrey''': ''(interested)'' I'll take care of the invitations right now.
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: In [[Marinette's room]], Marinette is looking at her invitation with a picture of [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]].}}
<poem>
'''Alya''': ''(To the kwamis)'' Basically, everyone's invited to this party, where Adrien's gonna receive the Fashion Icon award from Style Queen magazine!
''(We see that Marinette is standing, looking at the invitation dreamily.)''
'''Alya''': That's why she's been paralyzed for ten minutes.
'''[[Roaar]]''': Roar! Since everyone's invited, can we come too?
'''Kwamis''': Yeah! 
'''Marinette''': Wait a sec. Sorry, but you know the rule. ''(holds hand up)'' No holder, no wander. ''(folds arms)''
'''[[Trixx]]''': In that case, I can come since I have a holder.
'''Marinette''': Technically no, I hold on to her Miraculous.
'''Trixx''': Well then, just give it to her permanently. 
'''Alya''': Trixx isn't wrong, Marinette. Now that I know you're Ladybug, I can help you.
'''Marinette''': No, that'd be too risky. You know the rule, no Miraculous out of my sight, no flight.
'''Alya''': You're the guardian, your call. ''(holds up phone with picture of Adrien)'' Besides, it's time to go see Adrien at the Fashion Icon.
''(Marinette looks at Alya and turns around, blushes and looks at the invitation)''
'''Marinette''': Adrien!
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: [[Tour Montparnasse]].}}
<poem>
''(Marinette, Adrien, Alya, Nino, Luka, Kagami, Max and Kim are seen walking towards the entrance, where a large poster of Adrien is shown. They walk to an elevator)''
'''Nino and Alya''': Yeah! ''(they perform their "secret handshake")'' Pew pew! Pew pew! ''(laughs)''
'''Kim''': I bet I can get there before the elevator does! Max, time me. 
'''Max''': Ready.. GO! 
''(Kim sprints off toward the staircase.)''
'''Alya''': ''(whispering to Marinette)'' Elevators are perfect for getting close to your ''secret crush''! ''(pushes Marinette towards the elevator, where Adrien is)''
'''Marinette''': What? No! ''(uncomfortable, she pushes her hands forwards on the wall, and pushes against it while Alya tries to push her in)'' What if we accidentally... touch?! 
''(In the elevator, Kagami and Max look on negatively while Adrien and Luka merely smile at Marinette. The elevator eventually closes, leaving Marinette, Alya and Nino the only ones behind)'' 
'''Marinette''': Let's.. not rush things, 'kay?
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: On the stage.}}
<poem>
''([[Audrey Bourgeois]] stands with Adrien Agreste on the stage, as well as a presenter and [[Chloé Bourgeois]])''
'''Nino and Alya''': Yeah! ''(they do their 'secret handshake')'' Pew pew! Pew pew! ''(they laugh; Marinette smiles at them)''
'''Audrey''': Urgh! If you don't start filming this instant, you're fired!
'''Unnamed presenter''': But we have to wait for [[Alec Cataldi]], he's the MC!
'''Audrey''': Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!
''(Optigami is seen flying into an Adrien poster, watching)''
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: Natalie's Room}}
<poem>
''(Nathalie taps a control panel, which is broadcasting the fashion show)''
'''Nathalie''': Optigami is in place sir.
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]]''': Ladybug has no idea that her defeat will be captured on film. Icing on the cake.
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: Male restroom.}}
<poem>
''(Shadow Moth gets his [[Hand Fan|hand fan]] out, while Alec plays a game on his phone in a stall.)''
'''Alec''': Yeah! Come on!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(holds an feather, evilizes it into an amok, and puts it into his [[cane]]. He holds a hand out and creates a [[Sentimonster]] version of Alec)''
'''Alec''': ''(walking out of his stall, he is flabbergasted at seeing Sentialec)'' Hey! What's that?
'''Shadow Moth''': [[Sentialec]], you're up.
'''Sentialec''': At your command, Shadow Moth.
''(As Sentialec walks out of the restroom, the real Alec sits on the floor cowardly.)''
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: Stage}}
<poem>
''(Sentialec kicks the door open and dances on. The audience applaud him.)''
'''Audrey''': It's about time.
'''Unnamed presenter''': Roll!
'''Sentialec''': You won't be disappointed!
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: Male restroom.}}
<poem>
''' Shadow Moth''': ''(speaking through Sentialec)'' You'll see. It was worth the wait.
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: In the [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie]], [[Tom Dupain]] and [[Sabine Cheng]] are watching the event on TV.}}
<poem>
'''Sentialec''': ''(shown on TV)'' Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the outdated headquarters of Style Queen magazine, that's almost as outdated as Audrey Bourgeois herself!
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: Stage. Audrey gasps, and the audience mock her, but Marinette, Alya and Nino exchange concerned looks. Chloé also laughs loudly, but recovers herself, but Audrey becomes even more angered thanks to her daughter.}}
<poem>
'''Sentialec''':  Well, well, has the Queen suddenly lost her voice?
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: Male restroom.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(continuing)'' What a shame. She could have told you that this whole award ceremony is rigged.
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: Stage}}
<poem>
'''Sentialec''': ''(to Adrien)'' Sorry, my boy. ''(looks smugly at Audrey)''
'''Audrey''': ''(shoves Adrien off the stage)'' That's false! Utterly false! ''(to the audience)'' Don't listen to him. ''(back to Sentialec)'' You! How dare you?! You're-
'''Sentialec''': ''(interrupting Audrey and finishing her sentence)'' Fired! Haha! Too late! You already ridiculed yourself already.
''(The audience continue to laugh cruelly. Audrey looks down, miserable and in tears.)''
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: Male restroom.}}
<poem>
''(Shadow moth releases an akuma)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Fly away, my little [[akuma]], and evilize this wonderfully vile queen again.
</poem>
''{{Scene|Scene: Hallways. The akuma flies out of the toilets through the hallways, towards Audrey.}}
''{{Scene|Scene: Stage}}
<poem>
''(Sentialec looks at the akuma and steps away. The akuma enters the flower pin on Audrey's hat)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from bathroom)'' Style Queen, I am Shadow Moth. This MC has lost all sense of style and class.
'''Audrey''': ''(interrupts)'' Spare me the boring speech, Shadow Moth, give me back my powers and I'll give you the two trinkets you're so obsessed with!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from bathroom)'' Immediately, my queen.
''(A purple cloud engulfs Audrey, replacing her with Style Queen. The audience run away. Marinette looks at Alya determinedly and Alya nods.)''
'''Alya:''' ''(whispers to Nino)'' We gotta be ready in case Ladybug needs us. Come on. ''(Nino and Alya go one way while Marinette goes the opposite way.)''
'''Sentialec:''' ''(mockingly)'' Glitter? Really? For a style queen, you sure a fashion victim. ''(runs away laughing)''
'''Style Queen:''' 'You're' the only victim around here! 
''(she fires at Sentialec, but he jumps over a couch, and the beam turns the couch into a pile of glitter. Sentialec runs away laughing. She then aims at Chloé and Adrien, but then her arm is torn off when Kagami throws a chair at her.)''
'''[[Kagami Tsurugi|Kagami]]:''' Go, Adrien! Run!
'''Adrien:''' Kagami, NO!
'''Style Queen:''' ''(her arm returns)'' Since you want to play the hero, you'll be the first to get fired! ''(blasts her staff at Kagami, turning her into a pile of glitter. Adrien and Chloé run away.)''

''(The eyes from the elevator disappear.)''
'''Adrien''': Phew, what were you gonna tell me?
'''Marinette''': Uh, nothing, you?

''(Adrien and Marinette are standing against each side of the elevator and Rena Rouge comes in through a Voyage portal)''

'''Kaalki''': Voyage!
'''Rena Rouge''': You first.
''(Rena drags Adrien through the portal. The portal closes)''
'''Tikki''': Wow Marinette, that was very well played!

'''Ladybug''': Just so I know, how many times did you use you power?
'''Kaalki''': ''(nervous)'' Uhh, a certain amount of times...?

'''Lady Bee''': Amazing job Rena.
''(Lady Bee spots Senticarapace sneaking around, unaware that he's a Sentimonster)''
'''Lady Bee''': Carapace?
'''Rena Rouge''': There's never too many of us to help, right?
'''Lady Bee''': Mmm, you're right. Carapace will be useful to us.
''(Lady Bee and Rena hide behind a table so she could summon her [[Lucky Charm]] and she gets a small mirror)''
'''Lady Bee''': ''(whispering)'' Lucky Charm.
''(She looks around but doesn't see anything she could do with her mirror)''
'''Lady Bee''': Weird, I think I can beat Style Queen without my Lucky Charm. Well, the important thing is to beat her no matter. Now, call back your illusion.
''(Lady Bee runs off while Style Queen is still fighting the Ladybug illusion)''
'''Style Queen''': So, you want to play hide and seek Ladybug?

''(Lady Bee transforms into Ladybug and breaks Style Queen's rose that contains the Akuma.)''

'''Kaalki''': Hello, Cat Noir.
'''Ladybug''': Sorry, Cat Noir, I would've come to get you if I knew your true identity.
'''Cat Noir''': Like I always say milady, “to know me is to love me”.
'''Ladybug''': On second thought. ''(laughs quietly)'' Rena Rouge, Carapace. ''(they all run to the top of the tower while Cat Noir stays behind)'' Stay here Cat Noir, I'll be back.

<poem>
'''Rena Rouge''': It was so easy to beat the villain this time.

'''Ladybug, Rena Rouge and Senticarapace''': Pound It!
'''Rena Rouge''': Let's rest.
'''Senticarapace''': Shell off.
''(They detransform and hand over their Miraculouses to Ladybug)''

{{Scene|Scene: Tour Montparnasse roof}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': Normally it's been the key element to defeat the villain.
'''Shadow Moth''': Our trap has just snapped shut, Ladybug!
'''Ladybug''': I guess it was only here to help repair everything. ''(looks confused when she sees her compact mirror)''
''(She notices Nino acting confused of his handshake with Alya. Sentinino gives Alya a simple hi-five)''
''(Ladybug remembers their special hi-five in a flashback)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(looks at both of them with curious look)'' We're gonna have to be a lot more careful now. Shadow Moth knows the identities of some of the people I have given a miraculous and apparently he decided to use this information. ''(looks at Sentinino)'' Isn't that right, Shadow Moth?
''(Alya becomes shocked, and Sentinino panicks as he got exposed)''
'''Ladybug''': I'm sorry Alya, you better move away from him. This isn't Nino, it's a Sentimonster.
'''Alya''': Huh? ''(gasps)''

'''Cat Noir''': ''(shocked when Ladybug shows up and what she saying)'' But it's a miraculous!
'''Ladybug''': Trust me.
''(Cat Noir trusts her and uses his Cataclysm to destroy the Miraculous)''
''(Optigami flies out from the Miraculous after it's destroyed)''

'''Ladybug''': Thanks to my lucky charm, kitty cat, it always shows me the right way, except this time, I'd gotten the villain wrong.
''(Cat Noir understands what Ladybug is saying to him)''

{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. Marinette and Alya are sitting on the chaise longue.}}
<poem>
'''Alya''': Shadow Moth almost unmasked you because of me. I should have never taken the Turtle Miraculous.
'''Marinette''': It's true, you did make a mistake, and that's why I have to make a difficult decision. The most important thing is to learn from our mistakes. And today, I learned that I need an ally who will replace me if something happens to me one day. ''(hands Alya the Fox Miraculous)'' From now on, you will keep the Miraculous of the Fox with you, and I'm going to tell you ''everything'' I know.
''(Alya smiles. She and Marinette hug. The kwamis watch them as they continue to hug.)''
'''Trixx''': See, I'm always right, even when I'm wrong!
</poem>
{{Scene|Epilogue Scene: Nathalie's room. Gabriel walks to Nathalie's bed and sits down.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': We don't know our enemies well enough Nathalie. Alya Césaire seems to have a special status in the organization Ladybug has set up since she has became guardian. It's time to take an interest in her.
''(Nathalie agrees and smiles.)''
