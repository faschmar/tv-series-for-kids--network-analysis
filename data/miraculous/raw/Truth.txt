{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair]]. Gabriel is fixing the [[Peacock Miraculous]] following translated instructions from the [[Miraculous spellbook]].}}
<poem>
'''[[Nathalie Sancoeur|Nathalie]]:''' ''(voice-over)'' Dust from the sky, now precious, will fix the wings of the injured animal. Combine the molten gold with the meteorite powder. Then, add the peacock feather. 
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel]]:''' Miraculous, repair yourself! ''(the miraculous glows and hovers, then lands in his hand repaired)'' It's perfect, as good as new! Now it's completely safe to use. ''(puts Miraculous on)'' 
'''[[Duusu]]:''' ''(appears from the Miraculous)'' Wow, I feel so much better! What happened? Huh? Nooroo! ''(hugs Nooroo)'' Oh wow, everything was so chaotic in my head, like a nightmare where I'd fallen into very bad hands!
'''[[Nooroo]]:''' Sorry, old friend, but I'm afraid the nightmare is not over yet. ''(points to Gabriel, wearing both Miraculous)''
<center> '''''[Transformation Sequence]''''' </br> '''Gabriel:''' Nooroo, Duusu, Unify! </br> ''(Gabriel transforms into Shadow Moth)'' </br> </center>

{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. Marinette looking at a sketch and the [[Chinese Miracle Box|Miracle Box]]}}
<poem>
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]:''' So... they all live in there?
'''[[Tikki]]:''' Yes, except for Nooroo and Duusu, who are being held captive by the bad guys.
'''Marinette:''' [[Wang Fu|Master Fu]] never let them out? 
'''Tikki:''' ''(trying on hats)'' Only [[Kwamis]] like me who have a holder like you can go out into the human world, Marinette.
'''Marinette:''' But... ''(takes the box in her hands)'' isn't it a bit cramped in there?
'''Tikki:''' Oh no! There's a whole parallel world inside! Of course, being out here is much more interesting. You humans are so inventive!
'''Marinette:''' ''(notices button on the top of box, pushes it, causing all the kwamis to be freed. She falls over)'' I thought they couldn't get out?
'''Tikki:''' Now that you're the Guardian, the box has become just like you! Full of surprises! That's amazing!
'''[[Mullo]]:''' ''(snatches Tikki's hat off her head)'' Thanks Tikki!
'''Tikki:''' Hey! Marinette made that for me! ''(chases after Mullo)'' 
'''Marinette:''' ''(sees [[Trixx]] looking at her diary, gasps)'' That's my secret diary! ''(tucks diary away in drawer)'' 
'''[[Daizzi]]:''' ''(bouncing on on/off switch of desk lamp)'' Day! Night! Night! Day! ''(continues in background)'' 
'''[[Ziggy]]:''' ''(phone rings, holding Marinette's phone)'' Wow! It makes music, I love music! ''(Marinette tries and fails to grab the phone away, trips)''
'''Marinette:''' Careful with my phone!
'''[[Kaalki]]:''' ''(phases through window and looks out to the street in awe)'' Oh my, you have to see this! The carts are all moving on their own! There isn't a single horse here to pull them- ''(grabbed by Marinette)'' 
'''Kid:''' ''(pointing up in disbelief at the scene above)'' Look, mom!
'''Marinette:''' ''(pulls Kaalki closer, pretending she's a toy)'' Uh haha, it's a talking squishy, but it's not for sale yet! ''(closes window, sits down, exhausted by the kwamis' antics. At the desk, [[Stompp]] and [[Xuppu]] jump on the keyboard which turns on the news)''
'''[[Nadja Chamack]]:''' ''(on computer)'' The city of Paris is getting ready to celebrate famous [[Ali|Prince Ali's]] birthday! ''(alert comes on that [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] is calling. Marinette rushes over, grabs keyboard away from kwamis, and answers)'' 
'''Alya:''' Marinette?
'''Marinette:''' ''(still holding Kaalki while the other kwamis watch the monitor)'' Oh, Alya! What do you think of my new squishies? Pretty cute, right?
'''Alya:''' What new squishies?
'''Marinette:''' Uh- ''(looks at Kaalki, confused)''
'''Tikki:''' Marinette, we're magical creatures, remember? We can't be seen or heard on screen or in photographs. 
'''Ziggy:''' Ooh, so that's why I'm not showing up on these magic paintings!
'''Marinette:''' Right, she can only see me and I look completely ridiculous, don't I?
'''Alya:''' Marinette, are you feeling okay? 
'''Marinette:''' ''(attempting to recover)'' Aaah! Hey, girls! So happy to see you! Now is just the perfect time for a chat!
'''[[Rose Lavillant|Rose]]:''' ''(excitedly)'' Did you say new squishies? Show us!
'''Marinette:''' Uh... squishies? What squishies? ''(she tries to move the kwamis away and falls)''.. Ah!
'''Alya:''' Marinette, you okay?
'''[[Roaar]]:''' How'd your friends lock themselves in this picture frame? 
'''Daizzi:''' They look so cute. ''(referring to Alya)'' I want her as my holder.
'''Trixx:''' She's taken.
'''Mullo:''' ''(whines)'' Why does Trixx get to have a holder when we don't? 
'''Alya:''' Marinette, you're acting weirder than usual.
'''Marinette:''' Eh heh! I'm just... working out! ''(posing)'' I came up with this work out- it's uh- super special work out, hehe, to uh, be in shape before making squishies!
'''[[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]]:''' You should get some fresh air, you look overwhelmed.
'''Alya:''' Wait a minute: awkward gesturing, ridiculous babbling, weird excuses, clumsiness overload...
'''The girls:''' ''(gasp)'' ...is Adrien there?!
'''Marinette:''' What? Of course not. ''(Her phone rings, Ziggy throws it, she catches it and sees who's calling)'' [[Luka Couffaine|Luka]]? ''(drops the phone onto the keyboard, ending the video call)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Alya's room]].}}
<poem>
'''The girls:''' ''(adoringly)'' Luka...
'''[[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]]:''' ''(mumbles)''
'''The girls:''' ''(reacting to what Juleka said)'' Aw! That's so cute!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' ''(answering the phone)'' Wow Luka! Hi.
'''Luka:''' Hi, and thanks for the pictures.
'''Marinette:''' What do you mean "thanks"? 
'''Luka:''' Thanks for the photos of your bedroom ''(Marinette checks phone and discovers the accidentally-sent pictures)'' and of [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]]. 
'''Marinette:''' Ah, my room! Yeah, I- uh- it's full of photos of Adrien because I uh... I'm using them for fashion pics for my blog and I need your opinion on them because I know you have great taste, Adrien.
'''Luka:''' My name is Luka. 
'''Marinette:''' Haha yes of course, Adrie- I mean, Luka. You're Luka, obviously, hehe, because you're you, and I am me, Marinette. Hehe, uh, I'm so sorry, it's just that I've been so busted- uh I mean, busy!
'''Luka:''' No problem, Marinette, it's cool. So you ready? 
'''Marinette:''' ''(blankly)'' Ready for what? 
'''Luka:''' Well... our date. ''(shot widens to reveal that he is in her house, waiting)''
'''[[Sabine Cheng|Sabine]]:''' ''(calling to Marinette from downstairs)'' Marinette, Luka is waiting for you! 
'''Marinette:''' Right! Haha okay. I'll be right there! ''(grabs the kwamis and  the Miracle Box and shoves them into an empty cabinet. The kwamis phase their heads through the door)'' and remember, be good. Hide, Tikki. ''(opens purse, Tikki immediately gets in. She runs to her bedroom door and opens it)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Dupain-Cheng living room.}}
<poem>
'''Sabine:''' ''(right outside Marinette's door)'' Wasn't your date with Luka supposed to be yesterday? 
'''Marinette:''' ''(gasps, runs down stairs)'' No! I completely forgot about yesterday's date!
'''Luka:''' ''(Marinette standing in front of him)'' That's why we agreed that I'd come pick you up today, Marinette. It's the last screening, we can't miss it.
'''Marinette:''' ''(pretending to know what Luka is referring to)'' Of course, it would really be a shame to miss uh... ''(looks around, hoping someone else will finish. They don't, she continues)'' the thing we're gonna watch at this screening.
'''[[Tom Dupain|Tom]]:''' I can't believe they're showing it again! It was so silly when it came out 15 years ago, it can't be any better now.
'''Sabine:''' Oh honey, it was his first movie. Think about your first baguette, it was pretty bad, too. 
'''Luka:''' Sure the movie's a bit mindless, but Marinette and I love him so much that we swore we'd see it together.
'''Marinette:''' ''(remembering, claps her hands excitedly)'' I know! We're gonna see "Crocodile Heart", [[Jagged Stone|Jagged Stone's]] first movie.
'''Luka:''' Did you forget?
'''Marinette:''' ''(denying)'' Of course, not! And I don't have any other emergencies right now either. So... ''(walks over, grabs Luka's arm, and they both head out)'' come on, let's go.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Sorbonne|Movie Theater]]. Marinette and Luka play a game where they complete the lyrics in Jagged Stone's songs.}}
<poem>
'''Luka:''' "You are?.." "You are?.."
'''Marinette:''' ''(entering the movie theater)'' Is it "you are the popcorn of my life"?
'''Luka:''' ''(hands tickets over counter)'' Nope. It was "the ''donut'' of my life".
'''Marinette:''' Of course! "The donut", featured on the "Candy Apple" album! His food phase, my favorite! Two points for you.
'''Luka:''' ''(to the snack attendant)'' Two orange juices please. ''(takes the cups)'' Thank you. ''(to Marinette)'' I got another one: "I gave up everything..."
'''Marinette:''' "... but my dreams!"
'''Luka:''' Nice! Another point for you.
'''Marinette:''' ''(taking their seats as they continue their game)'' I got one: "my guitar..."
'''Luka:''' "... is my only family", featured on the "Alone on the Road" live concert. I love that song.
'''Marinette:''' ''(impressed)'' Whoa, twenty points to twelve. Luka Couffaine, you're officially Jagged Stone's number one fan! ''(nervously)'' And uh.. you uh.. ''(pulling out a small pink box from her purse)'' you win a prize.
'''Luka:''' ''(smiling, takes and opens the gift)'' Whoa!
'''Marinette:''' Jagged came by the bakery the other day, so I asked him to sign it for you.
'''Luka:''' The rules are clear, Marinette. This gift entitles you to a second round. "Under the moonlight, by the sea..."
'''Marinette:''' "Under the moonlight, by the sea..." Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue! ''(excitedly)'' I know! His very first song! "Under the moonlight, by the sea, KISS ME!" ''(theater goers look towards Marinette, confused. She giggles nervously, embarrassed)''
'''Luka:''' Okay, I mean, if you want to.
'''Marinette:''' I do... want to. ''(both leaning in for a kiss but interrupted by a loud thud)''
'''Luka:''' What was that? 
'''Marinette:''' ''(stands up suddenly, making up an excuse)'' Uh, probably the subway. It passes under the theater. I'm so thirsty all the sudden, I'm gonna go get some water. ''(leaves)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Restroom at the Movie Theater.}}
<poem>
'''Tikki:''' ''(Marinette shuts bathroom stall door)'' You're gonna leave Luka there all alone?
'''Marinette:''' What would I say? "Be right back, Luka, gotta go fight some bad guys" or "Gotta go Luka, by the way, I'm Ladybug"? Now that I'm the Guardian, I have to keep my identity a secret more than ever. Tikki, spots on!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Ladybug yoyos to [[Tour Montparnasse|Montparnasse Tower]]. She sees [[Xavier Ramier|Mr. Pigeon]] and checks her voicemail.}} 
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(on voicemail)'' Hey you, Bugaboo! Well, here I am, your faithful companion at our rendezvous point just like always. It's time for our daily patrol, I hope you haven't forgotten! (''sneaking up behind Ladybug while she is completely distracted)'' Buga-Boo! ''(Ladybug reflexively throws him)'' waaah! 
'''Ladybug:''' ''(realizing)'' Cat Noir? ''(catches his leg with her yoyo)'' 
'''Cat Noir:''' Wah! ''(slams into the window of the tower, cracking it)'' Oof! 
'''Woman inside building:''' ''(conversation interrupted)''
'''Ladybug:''' Will you cut it out with the practical jokes? I could have really hurt you!
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(answering while hanging by the yo-yo)'' M'lady, the only thing that really hurts me is when you make me go on patrol by myself. ''(sighs, relaxing his posture)'' I even missed your little angry pout.
'''Ladybug:''' Sorry, Kitty Cat, I'm a bit over my head at the moment. ''(pulling him up)'' 
'''Cat Noir:''' I bet! "Guardian of the Miraculous", big name, big responsibility!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(helping him up)'' I promise, I won't ever forget our patrols again. ''(Cat Noir winks at her, both head to defeat the villain)'' 
'''Cat Noir:''' Woohoo!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Movie Theater. Credits roll for the movie as Luka looks to Marinette's chair and sighs. Just then she runs back to her seat.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' ''(trying to act normal)'' Phew, there was a huge line at the water fountain, so I went out to buy bottles at the corner market but then there was an [[akuma]] alert. We were stuck in the store and they wouldn't let us out. Good thing Ladybug saved everyone! ''(sighs, content but then the screen goes dark as lights come back on)'' Oh no, is it over already? ''(Luka gives her an understanding smile)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette and Luka get ice cream from [[André]].}} 
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' ''(seeing a [[Lollipop Sentimonster|lollipop sentimonster]])'' Uh, the ice cream is gonna melt, we need napkins. I'll be quick! ''(hands him the ice cream and runs off. Luka stares down at it disappointedly)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In front of [[Collège Françoise Dupont]], Marinette waves to Alya, Nino, and Adrien before getting on Luka's bike}}
<poem>
'''Alya:''' Bye!
'''Adrien:''' ''(receives message from [[Kagami Tsurugi|Kagami]])'' Bye guys! ''(hurries to car waiting for him)'' 
'''Marinette:''' ''(sees an akuma)'' Luka, stop! ''(gets off bike, handing him her helmet)'' Sorry, I just remembered that I promised I would help a friend! I'll call you later! ''(disappears into the subway entrance, reappears on the other side as Ladybug)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Kitty Section]] performing in front of a small gathering of friends on the [[Liberty]]}}
<poem>
'''Luka:''' I'd like to dedicate this song to Marinette, a girl… ''(looks around, realizing Marinette is not there, dejectedly)'' who's not here as usual.
'''Rose:''' ♫ I love unicorns! I love unicorns! And cute little fluffy cats! ♫ ''(Luka playing his guitar solemnly. Marinette then arrives, takes a seat, and waves. He notices but doesn't acknowledge)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Under a bridge. Luka stops Marinette as they go on a walk.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' I'm sorry about earlier. There were mosquitoes on the boat, I thought we needed some insect repellent but the drug store was closed so I had to-
'''Luka:''' Shh, listen, the song of the water. If you listen carefully at this very spot under the bridge, you'll hear a melody. ''(They listen to the river and smile at each other.)'' You know, I never knew my father and my mom would never bring herself to tell me. So when I just couldn't deal with it all, I would take refuge here and the melody of the water would console me. What about you, Marinette? Where do you go when you disappear? 
'''Marinette:''' Uh-
'''Luka:''' You tell me, I'll accept it. If you're still in love with Adrien, I'll understand. I won't be jealous you know.
'''Marinette:''' That's not it, not at all.
'''Luka:''' Whatever it is, I just want it to be the honest truth.
'''Marinette:''' The truth, Luka… is the only thing I can't tell you. 
''(This word hits Luka so much that he suddenly feels heartbroken, upset and betrayed.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Hawk Moth's lair. Shadow Moth senses Luka's sadness.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth:''' Is there betrayal worse than the lies of the one you love? ''(He takes a feather from his fan, evillizes it into an [[amok]]. A butterfly lands in his other hand which he evilizes into an akuma.)'' Fly away my evil akuma, fly my beautiful amok, and rewrite the song of this heartbroken boy!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Under the bridge. Luka, still upset, looks down and closes his eyes, very rejected as the akuma and amok fly into his [[List of Akumatized objects|guitar pick necklace]].}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth:''' Truth, I am Shadow Moth. I'm giving you the power to force people to tell you their most sacred secrets. 
'''Luka:''' ''(struggling against it)'' Truth needs to be shared, not taken by force, Shadow Moth!
'''Marinette:''' ''(shocked what he just said)'' Uh! Shadow Moth? No! Luka, please resist, I am so sorry!
'''Shadow Moth:''' Why should you resist when she doesn't trust you? 
'''Luka:''' Marinette does trust me!
'''Marinette:''' I do! Of course I do!
'''Shadow Moth:''' If she trusted you, then she would tell you the truth! ''(Upon hearing this, Luka becomes shocked, so he kneels.)'' Accept my power and you will know everything. And all I ask of you in return is to expose Ladybug and Cat Noir's little secrets.
'''Luka:''' ''(succumbing)'' Run, Marinette! ''(As he succumbs, a purple ether appears and covers him. Marinette, horrified that Luka is akumatized, she runs away. Luka transforms into Truth by the akuma. He now wears black and blue bodysuit with three eyes, and now he is determined to find out Marinette's secrets.)''
'''Shadow Moth:''' ''(creates a Sentimonster)'' In addition to your power, you will be aided by [[Light Eye]]. ''(Light Eye is giant angry eye ball sentimonster)'' This [[Sentimonster|sentimonster]] will be under your control. ''(Light Eye is created by the amok)'' It's time to expose the truth.

</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The Liberty. Alya and everyone else are leaving.}}
<poem>
'''Alya:''' Bye guys, see ya. ''(Light Eye immobilizes her)'' Oh… ''(Truth shoots his beam at Alya)''
'''Truth:''' Tell me the truth, what is Marinette's secret!
'''Alya:''' She is.. in love with Adrien Agreste.
'''Truth:''' ''(already knows it; annoyed)'' That's not a secret! ''(Light Eye lets Alya go and immobilizes Mylène. Truth then shoots his beam at her.)'' Tell me the truth, what is Marinette's secret? 
'''Mylène:''' Marinette is in love with Adrien Agreste.
'''Truth:''' ''(determined)'' She must have another secret!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(leaving a message on her yo-yo)'' Cat Noir, Hawk Moth's merged his powers with the Peacock to become Shadow Moth. He's created a supervillain and a sentimonster at the same time. I need you out here!
'''Rose:''' ''(Truth walks towards Rose)'' Marinette doesn't have any secrets because she's the most honest girl in the whole world. ''(before Rose can be immobilized, Juleka protects her and is immobilized instead. Truth shoots his beam at her)''
'''Truth:''' What is Marinette's secret? 
'''Juleka:''' She loves Adrien, I guess.
'''Ladybug:''' I'm the one waiting for you this time! ''(confronts Truth)'' Enough! ''(Truth starts shooting his beams at Ladybug. She dodges them but notices the guitar pick necklace)'' Luka? ''(gets immobilized by Light Eye and hit by Truth's beam)''
'''Truth:''' Now, you must tell the truth to anyone who asks you a question. I'll do the honors. Who are you, Ladybug?
'''Shadow Moth:''' I'll finally find out Ladybug's true identity!
'''Ladybug:''' I… am… 
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(interrupts and pushes Ladybug into the water with him in order to not let Ladybug tell him her real identity)'' A super swimmer!
'''Shadow Moth:''' ''(impatiently)'' Pull them out, Truth! Pull them out now!
'''Truth:''' I must know Ladybug's secret identity!
'''[[Anarka Couffaine|Anarka]]:''' ''(notices Truth)'' Hey! what are you doing on my ship, pirate? ''(gets immobilized by Light Eye and struck by Truth's beam)''
'''Truth:''' It's time to tell me the truth, Mom! Who is my father? 
'''Anarka:''' Luka, your father is.. Jagged Stone.
'''Truth:''' ''(shocked)'' I want the truth! Who is ''really'' my father?
'''Anarka:''' Jagged Stone.
'''Truth:''' ''(flabbergasted)'' Sorry, Shadow Moth, but that truth can't be put on hold! ''(jumps away)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Cat Noir helps Ladybug out of the water. }}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(noticing Ladybug is nervous about being compelled to tell the truth)'' Don't worry, I'll never claw a secret out of you, M'lady. ''(Ladybug relaxes and points to his belt.)'' Uh? ''(He gives it to her and she wraps it over her mouth, thus gagging herself.)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(muffled)'' Mhmm! ''(thumbs up)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Le Grand Paris]] rooftop. Truth confronts Jagged Stone as he rehearses a song.}}
<poem>
'''Jagged Stone:''' ♫ Oh [[Ali|Prince Ali]] you're one year older but to us you're still a real rock and roller ♫- ''(Gets immobilized by Light Eye)'' Hey! Easy on the spotlight buddy, it's only a rehearsal.
'''Truth:''' I am not your buddy. I'm here to find out if I'm your son.
'''Jagged:''' Uh, depends on who you are.
'''Cat Noir:''' Hey, I wanna play too. Truth or dare? 
'''Ladybug:''' ''(muffled)'' Mmhm.
'''Truth:''' Truth and dare. Light Eye, freeze Ladybug and Cat Noir! ''(Light Eye distracts Ladybug and Cat Noir so Truth can talk)'' My name is Luka Couffaine and I have the right to know the truth! ''(shoots his beam at Jagged Stone)'' Are you or are you not my father?!
'''Jagged:''' Luka Couffaine? Yes, I am your father. 
''(Truth becomes stricken with so much shock to hear that the  most famous rock guitar player was his father this entire time and he didn't notice. Ladybug and Cat Noir are shocked as well.)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(muffled)'' Mmm?!
''(Cat Noir gasps)''
'''Truth:''' ''(shocked and upset)'' Why would you hide this from me, and why did you abandon me?!
'''Jagged:''' I was too lame to take care of a kid. I'm sorry, son, but I spent my whole life on tour. I live in hotels with a crocodile. I could never be the father you'd need me to be. Besides, it made for a super cool song! Have you heard "My guitar is my only family"? 
'''Truth:''' Why don't you write a song about THIS?! (''Still angry that Jagged left him, in his rage, Truth tosses Jagged into an alleyway; Ladybug and Cat Noir leap after him'')
'''Shadow Moth:''' Follow them!
'''Truth:''' Sorry Shadow Moth, I still have one last truth to uncover.
'''Shadow Moth:''' ''(annoyed)'' How can I be sure that it's really the last one?
'''Truth:''' Because ''I'' always tell the truth! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Alleyway. Ladybug uses her yo-yo to save Jagged Stone.}}

'''Jagged:''' Woohoo! My son is out of sight!
(''Light Eye almost catches sight of the heroes, but they hide, so the sentimonster moves on'')
'''Cat Noir:''' Now ''you'' stay out of sight while we deakumatize him. (''jumps'')
'''Ladybug:''' (''muffled'') hmm! (''jumps'')
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(attempting to get Light Eye's attention)'' Yoohoo!

<poem>
'''Truth:''' ''(shoots his beam at Tom)'' What is Marinette's secret?
'''Tom:''' She's in love with Adrien Agreste.
'''Truth:''' Not that secret! '(shoots his beam at Sabine)'' Does she keep a diary?
'''Sabine:''' Yes, she hides it in her room.
'''Truth:''' Perfect. That should hold all her secrets. 
''(Tom attempts to block him from going up the stairs, but he is unsuccessful)''

'''[[Xuppu]]:''' ''(determined)'' Not if I can help it! ''(attempts to leave cabinet and use the power)''
'''[[Wayzz]]:''' ''(stops Xuppu)'' Wait, you know your magical force is too powerful without a keeper to control it! Remember when Plagg sunk Atlantis?
'''Ziggy:''' ''(worried)'' So we have a choice between the end of the world and '''''the end of the world?!'''''
'''Truth:''' ''(about to open cabinet containing the Miracle Box but is stopped by Ladybug's yo-yo wrapping around his wrist)'' Light Eye, come back. Now!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(muffled)'' Mmm hmm! ''(motioning to the akumatized object)''
'''Cat Noir:''' Hmm? ''(understanding what Ladybug meant)''  That's the akumatized object! Got it! [[Cataclysm]]! 
'''Ladybug:''' (muffled, thrown into trunk by Truth) mmmm!
'''Cat Noir:''' M'lady whenever you're ready you can call up your [[Lucky Charm]]!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(muffled, pointing out she's still gagged)'' Mmhmmm! 
'''Cat Noir:''' Take it off. I have a plan! ''(Ladybug takes the belt off her mouth)''
'''Truth:''' Ladybug, tell us what's your- 
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(trips Truth)'' Top three favorite qualities in Cat Noir!
'''Ladybug:''' I have to say it's his courage, his self-confidence, but really the quality I like most in Cat Noir is his humor.
'''Cat Noir:''' So you're saying you actually like it when I clown around?
'''Ladybug:''' Yes, and I couldn't do without it today!
'''Truth:''' Ladybug, under your mask, what do you- ''(knocked over by Cat Noir)''
'''Cat Noir:''' Use when all seems lost? ''(winks at her)''
'''Ladybug:''' My Lucky Charm! ''(receives [[List of Lucky Charm objects|a box of aluminum foil]]). Before she could use her Lucky Vision, she gets interrupted by Light-Eye breaking in from behind her. She sees Cat Noir get immobilized and hit by Truth's beam)'' Cat Noir!
'''Truth:''' Cat Noir, tell me what- (interupted by Ladybug throwing a present at Truth)
'''Ladybug:''' (''covering her parasol with foil'') ...do you think about my new role as guardian!
'''Cat Noir:''' If it doesn't change things between us, then I'm good with it! 
''(Ladybug finally uses her Lucky Vision and spots Light Eye, a parasol, and the box of aluminum foil that she's holding. She grabs the parasol and wraps the aluminum foil around it as she pulls Light Eye to Cat Noir and cataclysms it. Light Eye starts to move uncontrollably around the room.)''
'''Truth:''' Light Eye, stop! 
(''Ladybug attaches her yo-yo to Light Eye, and aims it at the parasol, which reflects its beam back to Truth. Ladybug throws her yo-yo at Truth's necklace, freeing the akuma and amok''.)
'''Ladybug:''' No more evil doing for you little akuma! Time to de-evilize! ''(captures akuma and amok and purifies them)'' Gotcha! ''(Releases the now purified butterfly and feather)'' Bye! [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]! ''(Throws the Lucky Charm into the air, and it explodes into a blast of energy. It turns everything back to normal, everyone's lips are now normal, the broken wall in Marinette's room is fixed, and Truth turns back into Luka)''

<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' Woo hoo! ''(sighs)'' M'lady, it's been awhile since I've had that much fun.
'''Ladybug:''' If battling a supervillain with three eyes and a giant monster buddy is your idea of fun, I can't imagine what your other days are like. 
'''Cat Noir:''' A baddie, a sentimonster, and Shadow Moth. It's even more exciting with his new name, don't you think? 
'''Ladybug:''' He can change his name as often as he likes. He'll still never win.
