{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] is frustrated that she can't figure out a riddle in the [[Miraculous spellbook]].}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' [[Tikki]], I'm so confused! These riddles [[Wang Fu|Master Fu]] translated are too cryptic. 
'''Tikki:''' Their meanings are hidden on purpose, to protect the secret of our magic powers.
'''Marinette:''' Yeah but what good does it do if even the Guardian of the Miraculous, can't figure them out?
'''Tikki:''' Master Fu had trouble too with the first ones and remember, you were the one who helped him with the aqua power!
'''Marinette:''' ''(stands up, determined)'' You're right, I'm gonna figure this out! ''([[Xuppu]] and [[Mullo]] grab an apple)''
'''Tikki:''' ''(to Xuppu and Mullo)'' What are you doing? ''(They drop the apple on the keyboard, turning on the news)''
'''[[Nadja Chamack|Nadja]]:''' ''(on computer)'' The city of Paris is getting ready to celebrate the famous [[Ali|Prince Ali's]] birthday— ''(Xuppu and Mullo step on keys of the keyboard while struggling to move the apple and turn it to another news segment)''
'''[[Alec Cataldi|Alec]]:''' ''(on computer)'' This special report on the fascinating life of [[Adrien Agreste]]!
'''Marinette:''' ''(Marinette stops what she's doing and watches dreamily)'' Adrien… 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: News segment on Adrien's life}}
<poem>
'''Alec:''' We were able to spend the entire day with this famous, young model! ''(Adrien yawns while posing for a wax statue)''
'''[[Vincent]]:''' ''(taking pictures of Adrien while he poses)'' Perfect! Just-a Stunning! Mwah! I need a smile more al dente! Haha!
'''Adrien:''' ''(performing on stage. Talking with a pencil in his mouth)'' How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? 
'''Sarah:''' ''(judging Adrien)'' Not bad but could you do it for me with a bit more… orange? ''(Adrien laughs awkwardly)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' ''(sighs and smiles)'' What a fascinating life.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Adrien's room]]. }}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' ''(sighs)'' What a boring day.
'''[[Plagg]]:''' Without even a lunch break. Ridiculous!
'''Adrien:''' ''(plays piano music from his phone to make it seem like he's practicing)'' Finally! Free at last! Plagg, claws out! 
'''Plagg:''' ''(holding a piece of Camembert)'' What? Oh no! ''(gets sucked into the ring)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Cat Noir on patrol, waiting for Ladybug.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(using his staff to travel)'' Haha, Woohoo! Haha! ''(looks around)'' Bugaboo? ''(checks his phone)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(voicemail)'' Hi! It's Ladybug, leave a message!
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(leaving message)'' Hey, Bugaboo. Well here I am, your faithful companion at our rendezvous point just like always. It's time for our daily patrol, I hope you haven't forgotten. ''(waits awhile for Ladybug to show but she never does)''
'''Plagg:''' ''(from phone)'' No messages. Don't forget my cheese! 
'''Cat Noir:''' What could she be doing? 
'''Ladybug:''' ''(voicemail)'' Hi! It's Ladybug, leave a message!
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(leaving another message for Ladybug, discouraged)'' Maybe it's because now since you're Guardian of the Miraculous, ''(finger quotes)'' you've got all sorts of more important things to do ''(tries to cheer up)'' but hey, no biggie. I'm just the Cat for this job. I'll start without you. Hope to meet up with you later. Let me know. ''(looks disappointed again but starts his patrol)''
'''Citizens:''' ''(see Cat Noir and excitedly call for him)'' Cat Noir! Cat Noir! Cat Noir!
'''Cat Noir:''' Time for some action, finally! ''(goes down to see them, gets into a fighting stance)''
'''Citizens:''' Cat Noir! Oh my gosh. ''(three kids crowd around him, take a photo, then leave)'' Oh wow. Thank you Cat Noir.
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(unenthusiastically)'' At your service. ''(checking for a message again)''
'''Plagg:''' ''(from phone)'' No messages. Don't forget my cheese!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Place des Vosges]]. Cat Noir sitting on a bench with [[Mr. Ramier]] and [[Mr. Banana]].}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' So Mr. Banana, life's peachy huh? Peachy, banana, get it? ''(Mr. Banana doesn't respond)'' Forget it. So Mr. Ramier, it's been awhile since you were akumatized right? Don't ya kind of miss being Mr. Pigeon? You haven't been feeling a bit depressed or desperate or angry? Annoyed maybe? Not even a little perturbed?
'''Mr. Ramier:''' Thank you for asking Cat Noir but I am in the best of spirits, really!
'''Cat Noir: ''' Well I guess I'm out of here then. ''(gets up and slowly walks away, feeling low)''
'''Mr. Ramier:''' ''(waves)'' Say hello to the lovely Ladybug for me!
'''Cat Noir:''' Sure thing… if I ever see her…
'''Plagg:''' ''(from phone, more annoyed)'' No messages. Don't forget my cheese!

{{Scene|Scene: Le Grand Paris Hotel. Cat Noir drinking milk while watching [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] berate [[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]]. }}
<poem>
'''[[Butler Jean]]:''' ''(placing glass on a coaster)'' A glass of milk as usual, Mr. Cat Noir? 
'''Cat Noir:'''  ''(nods head weakly)'' Mhm
'''Butler Jean:''' How is Ms. Ladybug? ''(starts pouring milk into glass)'' I haven't seen her for a while?
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(takes the milk and downs it)'' It's… been a little quiet recently. 
'''Chloé:''' ''(angry, yelling at Sabrina)'' That purse was my life Sabrina! And you, you have gone and lost it! You are forbidden to speak to me ever again! 
'''Sabrina:''' But Chloé— ''(trying to point to the purse that Chloé has on her)''
'''Chloé:''' Shh, No talking! Zip it!
'''Sabrina:''' But—
'''Chloé:''' Shh!
'''Sabrina:''' But—
'''Chloé:''' ''(puts her finger over Sabrina's mouth)'' Zip it! And don't even look at me either! Hands over your eyes! ''(Sabrina gasps, upset, and uses her hands to cover her eyes)'' 
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(hopeful)'' Something tells me an akuma is going to show up!
'''Chloé:''' Hmm? ''(notices she's wearing her purse)'' Oh my purse! ''(to Sabrina)'' You dingbat! ''(hits Sabrina with the purse)'' You could have told me that I was wearing it! 
'''Sabrina:''' ''(attempts to explain)'' But I wasn't allowed to speak to you—
'''Chloé:''' ''(interrupts)'' And you still aren't.
'''Sabrina:''' Uh—
'''Chloé:''' Shh! ''(walks away, Sabrina follows her)''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(sighs, disappointed. Turns back to counter)'' Make that ''(pushes empty glass towards Jean)'' a large milk pal. ''(Jean gets out a pitcher and fills it with milk)''

{{Scene|Scene: Paris rooftop. Cat Noir overhears Kagami as she practices fencing with her mother.}}
<poem>
'''Plagg:''' ''(from phone, frustrated)'' No messages. Don't forget my— ''(Cat Noir clicks away before he finishes)''
'''Ladybug:''' '' (voicemail)'' Hi! It's Ladybug, leave a message!
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(leaving another message for Ladybug, slightly annoyed)'' Hi again, Bugaboo. Guess who this is. Give up? It's the guy you stood up— ''(stops abruptly upon hearing [[Kagami Tsurugi|Kagami]])''
'''Kagami:''' Yes, never let yourself be weak, mother. I know that lesson well.
'''Cat Noir:''' Huh? ''(observes the practice from the roof)''
'''[[Tomoe Tsurugi|Tomoe]]:''' And never be—
'''Kagami:''' Taken by surprise. 
'''Tomoe:''' ''(aggressively attacking with her bokken)'' Don't apply these principles to fencing, you'll never be as good as Adrien Agreste!
'''Kagami:''' Adrien? Don't worry mother. ''(makes Tomoe momentarily lose grip of her bokken, but she manages to catch it)'' I've got everything I need to succeed with him.
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(watching with a smile, leaving message)'' Patrol's over, Bugaboo! ''(closes phone and heads back to his room)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Cat Noir arrives and detransforms.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' Claws in. 
''(Adrien picks up his phone, stops music and longingly looks at the picture of Ladybug he uses as his phone's background)''
'''Plagg:''' ''(over a picture of Adrien's fencing class where Kagami stands out in her red uniform)'' So your favorite cheese is missing from the plate and it's as if the others don't exist? Try another type, you might be surprised how much you like it! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Agreste dining room. Adrien eating alone.}}
<poem>
'''[[Nathalie Sancoeur|Nathalie]]:''' ''(alerting Adrien by tablet)'' Ms. Kagami Tsurugi called to inform you that the time of your fencing has been changed to one hour earlier this week.
'''Adrien:''' ''(happy)'' Huh, thank you, Nathalie. ''(warmly)'' Kagami, Kagami… 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Both Kagami and Adrien in their cars, headed to [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] for their fencing practice.}}
<poem>
'''Tomoe:''' ''(on phone, speaking to Kagami)'' All these scheduling changes requested by the Agrestes are annoying. But you can use it to fit in another hour of Russian.
'''Kagami:''' ''(weakly)'' Yes, mother.
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel:]]''' All these scheduling changes requested by the Tsurugi are annoying. When you get home, make sure you try on the outfit I've just completed for your next photoshoot.
'''Adrien:''' ''(weakly)'' Yes, father.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien and Kagami enter School. [[Fred Haprèle]] is confused to see them.}}
<br /><poem>
'''Mr. Haprèle:''' Kagami? Adrien? Your fencing class doesn't start for an hour. And Mr. D'Argencourt hasn't arrived yet.
'''Kagami:''' Oh really? And I was sure I wrote down the correct hour this time!
'''Mr. Haprèle:''' I'm sorry but you can't—
'''Kagami:''' ''(predicting what Mr. Haprèle was about to say)'' Stay at school without adult supervision? No problem, Mr. Haprèle. We'll come back for the class in an hour.
'''Adrien:''' What are you up to this time? 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien and Kagami enter the Art Room where Kagami shows Adrien her drawings.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' The arts and crafts room? What are you planning to do in here?
'''Kagami:''' ''(unzips her bag and pulls out a sketchbook)'' I've never told this to anyone but… I love to draw. I always have. ''(flips through pages of her art)'' Drawings never lie. The poses that people make are always a reflection of their personality. ''(Adrien gasps, surprised and impressed)''  But my mother won't let me do it, according to her, I'm not good enough…
'''Adrien:''' You're super talented Kagami!
'''Kagami:''' You really think so?
'''Adrien:''' Mmhm
'''Kagami:''' ''(takes his hand and directs him to the platform in the room)'' Pose for me, I want to sketch you.
'''Adrien:''' How do you want me to pose? 
'''Kagami:''' However makes you comfortable. ''(Adrien does one of his model poses. She starts drawing)'' I really admire [[wikipedia:Henri de Toulouse—Lautrec|Toulouse Lautrec]]. I'd like to draw you just like the characters he painted. Did you know he often signed his drawings with a monogram like many Japanese artists did? ''(looks at her drawing, unsatisfied)'' This isn't right, it's not you. ''(tears paper from sketchpad)''
'''Adrien:''' Can I see it? 
'''Kagami:''' ''(crumples paper and tosses it in the trash)'' Try a different pose. It should be easy to do a beautiful sketch of you because you're so handsome but what I want is to capture the real you inside. ''(Adrien tries another pose. Kagami starts drawing but stops)'' No, still not good. Change again ''(throws it away and Adrien attempts another pose)'' These are all modeling poses! ''(throws another away)'' Try something that's more natural, more you.
'''Adrien:''' Hmm, what about ''MEOW''! (''strikes Cat Noir pose, Kagami looks unimpressed)'' Uhh… ''(awkwardly)'' I mean ''now''? ''(laughs nervously)''
'''Kagami:''' No, you're not at all natural. 
'''Adrien:''' ''(earnestly)'' Yes, I am. I promise, this is me!
'''Kagami:''' NO! (''stands up, slamming sketchpad on table)'' That's you when you're being silly! 
'''Adrien:''' ''(conflicted)'' What if when I'm being silly, I'm really me?
'''Kagami:''' ''(Kagami stares then walks towards Adrien. She takes his hand and moves it to his chest then pushes him back to the wall)'' There. This is really you.
'''Adrien:''' ''(timidly)'' Do you really think?… 
'''Kagami:''' Yes, you're, perfect. ''(Kagami tries to kiss him but gets interrupted by the alert on both their phones)''
'''Adrien:''' ''(checks his phone. Kagami does the same)'' Now it's really time for our fencing class. ''(Both he and Kagami smile)''
</poem>

<poem>
'''[[Armand D'Argencourt|Mr. D'Argencourt]]:''' En garde! Prèt, allez!
'''Kagami:''' ''(they fence, then Kagami takes off her mask and kisses Adrien's)'' Touché.
'''Adrien:''' ''(Adrien takes off his mask and tries to kiss her)'' En garde. ''(sees Ladybug pass the school, chasing Mr. Pigeon's pigeon plane)'' Uh… sorry. ''(backing away)'' I forgot something in the locker room… ''(he leaves and Kagami gives a small smile)''

{{Scene|Scene: From "[[Truth]]" — Montparnasse Tower. Cat Noir sneaks up on Ladybug.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(Ladybug listening to Cat Noir's message on her phone)'' —Just like always. It's time for our weekly patrol. I hope you haven't forgotten! (''sneaking up behind Ladybug while she is completely distracted)'' Buga-Boo! ''(Ladybug reflexively throws him)'' waaah! 
'''Ladybug:''' Hi-ya!  ''(realizing)'' Cat Noir? ''(catches his leg with her yoyo)'' 
'''Cat Noir:''' Wah! ''(slams into the window of the tower, cracking it)'' Oof!  
'''Ladybug:''' Will you cut it out with your practical jokes? I could have really hurt you.
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(answering while hanging by the yoyo)'' M'lady, the only thing that really hurts me is when you make me go on patrol by myself. ''(sighs, relaxing his posture)'' I even missed your little angry pout.
'''Ladybug:''' Sorry Kitty Cat, I'm a bit over my head at the moment ''(pulling him up)'' 
'''Cat Noir:''' I bet! "Guardian of the Miraculous", big name, big responsibility!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(helping him up)'' I promise to never forget our patrols again. ''(Cat Noir winks at her, both head to defeat the villain)'' 
'''Cat Noir:''' Woohoo!

{{Scene|Scene: [[Luka]] leaves [[André|André's]] ice cream stand after the events of "Truth". Adrien meets Kagami there to get ice cream.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' ''(runs to meet Kagami)'' Kagami! ''(Takes ice cream but sees Ladybug fighting [[Lollipop Boy]] so he gives it to Kagami)'' I gotta get going my father's probably worried. ''(leaves, Kagami looks down, disappointed)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: From "Truth" — In front of Françoise Dupont. Adrien receives message from Kagami.}}

'''Adrien:''' ''(to his classmates)'' Bye guys! ''(Adrien gets into his car, Kagami's pulls up beside it. They roll down their windows and attempt to kiss but he sees Ladybug) Uh… forgot something in my classroom, (opens car door and runs back inside) call ya later!'' 
'''Kagami:''' ''(frustrated, sighs)'' Tatsu, let's go!
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(appears from the roof, launches himself with his staff)'' Wee!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The [[Liberty]]. Adrien and the rest of [[Kitty Section]] perform the end of the song they started in "Truth".}}
<poem>
'''Rose:''' ''(Finishing a song)'' Yeah!
'''Marinette, Nino, Alya:''' ''(Stand up, cheering. Kagami claps)'' Yeah! Woohoo!
'''Nino:''' ''(runs over to Adrien, showing him his phone)'' I got it all on video dude! You guys were awesome! 
'''Adrien:''' ''(critical of himself)'' I wasn't Nino. I messed up the intro.
'''Ivan:''' We can go over it again if you want, Adrien?
'''Rose:''' Yeah, let's play it again.
'''Kagami:''' Adrien, it's time!
'''Adrien:''' Five more minutes? 
''(Kagami shakes her head)'' 
'''Adrien:''' Well… I'll be better next time, I promise. See you guys. ''(Kagami takes his hand, he drops his bag in shock. Kagami helps him with it. They walk off the boat. Unaware [[Marinette's bracelet]] fell out of his pocket, Kagami notices and grabs it)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Just outside the Liberty, both wait to be picked up while Kagami tries to talk to Adrien.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' Our cars aren't here yet. That's too bad; we could have played the song again.
'''Kagami:''' But this way we have a little time together.
'''Adrien:''' ''(not understanding)'' We'll have plenty of time together when we go to Prince Ali's birthday.
'''Kagami:''' Together ''(takes his hand)'' just the two of us, I mean. I'm so happy when I'm with you. ''(Adrien sees Ladybug and gets distracted)'' I have a feeling we're a lot alike. Do you feel the same way? Do you also- ''(realizes Adrien isn't paying attention, turns around to see what he was looking at)'' Huh?
'''Adrien:''' Sorry, I thought I saw a wasp.
'''Kagami:''' ''(softly)'' Do you love... me too? 
'''Adrien:''' ''(still distracted)'' Excuse me? 
'''Kagami:''' ''(becoming upset)'' Adrien what's going on? 
'''Adrien:''' I… forgot something on the barge, when my bag fell. Don't wait up for me. Let's meet up at Prince Ali's birthday. ''(leaves)''
'''Kagami:''' ''(car pulls up and Kagami gets in, upset)'' Tatsu, take me to the city hall.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Adrien hides in an alley and transforms.}}
<poem>
'''Plagg:''' I hope we can still celebrate Ali's birthday. Fancy parties always have the best cheese boards!  
'''Adrien:''' Later, but right now Ladybug needs me! Plagg, claws out! ''(plays message from his staff phone)''
'''Ladybug:''' ''(from message)'' Cat Noir, Hawk Moth's merged his powers with the Peacock to become Shadow Moth. He's created a supervillian and a sentimonster at the same time. I need you out here!
'''Truth:''' Now you must tell the truth to anyone who asks you a question, I'll do the honors. Who are you Ladybug?
'''Ladybug:''' I… am… 
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(interrupts and pushes Ladybug into the water)'' A super swimmer!

'''[[André Bourgeois|André]]:''' ''(shaking hands with Prince Ali)'' Dear Prince Ali, on behalf of the city of Paris we all wish you a very happy birthday. 
'''Tomoe:''' ''(somehow notices Kagami walk up beside her)'' Didn't I arrange with Gabriel Agreste that his son would accompany you here? 
'''Kagami:''' Oh um… he's here mother. A journalist's interviewing him outside. I'll go and find him. ''(leaves room)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Kagami sits on the steps outside the city hall and solemnly looks down at the charm she's holding.}}
{{Scene|Scene: Ladybug and Cat Noir talking after just defeating Truth.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' Woo hoo! ''(sighs)'' M'lady, it's been awhile since I've had that much fun.
'''Ladybug:''' ''(laughs)'' If battling a supervillian with three eyes and a giant monster buddy is your idea of fun, I can't imagine what your other days are like…
'''Cat Noir:''' A baddie, a sentimonster, and Shadow Moth. It's even more exciting with his new name don't ya think? 
'''Ladybug:''' He can change his name as often as he likes, he'll still never win.
'''Cat Noir:''' You can count on me and my jokes, Bugaboo.
'''Ladybug:''' Well… you don't have to overdo it.
'''Cat Noir:''' Truth is, I only ever have this much fun with you. Catch ya later! (''vaults away'') Wee! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Kagami confronts Adrien outside the City Hall.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' Claws in. ''(detransforms)''
'''Adrien:''' ''(runs to meet up with Kagami)'' Kagami. I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long.
'''Kagami:''' ''(hiding the charm behind her back)'' And I hope you found what you were looking for. 
'''Adrien:''' Huh? 
'''Kagami:''' Back at the barge. 
'''Adrien:''' ''(nervously)'' Uh, the barge right. ''(gives thumbs up)'' Yeah I found it thank you. 
'''Kagami:''' What was it?
'''Adrien:''' ''(dismissively)'' Oh you know just that thing, that Lucky Charm that Marinette gave me. ''(attempts to take it out of his pocket to show her but realizes it's not there, worried)'' Ah no, did I lose it?! ''(attempts to cover up his accidental admission)'' Again…
'''Kagami:''' You mean… ''(shows him the charm in her hand)'' this one? ''(Adrien is shocked)'' You know, I lied too. I lied to my mother so that we could see each other. I even lied to her when I said you came here with me tonight. I lied at every fencing lesson so we could spend more time together. You see, we're both a couple of liars. Except I lie because I want to be with you. ''(points at him accusingly)'' You lie… because you don't want to be with me.
'''Adrien:''' ''(outstretches his arm)'' Kagami!
'''Kagami:''' I'll go in first. ''(opens door and sighs)''

'''Shadow Moth:''' Lies, I am Shadow Moth. I bestow on you the power to rid the world of liars. All I ask in return are Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous! Do I have your word? 
'''Kagami:''' Trust me, no more lies will be allowed in my new world Shadow Moth.
'''Adrien:''' ''(opens door, sees the akumatized bracelet)'' No!… ''(closes door; Lies starts creating a sphere)'' This is all my fault. I've gotta save Kagami!

'''Lies:''' I am Lies! Have you ever told a lie, Agent Roger? 
'''Roger:''' Of course not… a policeman never lies. 
'''Lies:''' You are a liar!
'''Roger:''' Help! (''Officer Roger is paralyzed'')
'''Lies:''' And you, mother, have you lied as well? 
'''Tomoe:''' Kagami, I will not allow this! (''attempts to stop Lies, but is paralyzed'')

<poem>
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(attempting to summon his power)'' [[Cataclysm|Cata]]— ''(Ladybug stops him)''
'''Ladybug:''' No! If you touch the sphere, you'll freeze.
'''Cat Noir:''' Not if I've always told the truth. 
'''Ladybug:''' Yeah, but is that the case? 
'''Cat Noir:''' Hardly. How 'bout you?
'''Ladybug:''' Of course not Kitty, we're supposed to lie. If only to keep our identities a secret. And if we touch that thing they'll be no one left to stop her from swallowing all of Paris! 
'''Cat Noir:''' Okay, so what do we do? 
'''Ladybug:''' [[Lucky Charm]]! (''receives a box larger than her; she opens it to reveal a camera drone with a remote'') Uh..
'''Cat Noir:''' I can't wait to see what you're gonna do with a drone. 
'''Ladybug:''' Okay, ''we'' can't go inside, but I doubt this machine ever lied. Which means… keep her busy while I send this spy bird inside! We'll stay in touch. ''(puts in earpiece)''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(puts in earpiece)'' Your wish is my command, M'Lady. And that's no lie. (''teasing Lies from the top of an advertising column'') Yoohoo! My name ''isn't'' Cat Noir, I'm ''not'' a superhero, I ''hate'' Ladybug, and I think Shadow Moth should have been called ''Peacock Moth!'' Way funnier! I forgot, my favorite dish is ''cauliflower'' with béchamel sauce.
'''Shadow Moth:''' Lies, catch that deceiving Cat and seize his Miraculous!
'''Lies:''' You have my word Shadow Moth. (''Ladybug discovers Lies' bracelet'') Liars will always have to pay in the end!
'''Ladybug:''' I know what the akumatized item is.
'''Cat Noir:''' Great, so break it! 
'''Ladybug:''' How do I do that when I can't touch it? 
(''Ladybug, through the drone's camera, notices all the guests at Prince Ali's party paralyzed, except for Fang'')
'''Cat Noir:''' You're right, only someone who's never lied can get into that sphere and do it but that doesn't exist!

'''Cat Noir:''' There are only two liars left in Paris and one of them knows the ultimate way to catch her attention.
