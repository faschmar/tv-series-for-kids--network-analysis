{{Scene|Scene: In the Parisian Streets. Ladybug and Cat Noir battle off with Glaciator. Cat Noir saves a man reading a magazine on the sidewalk while Ladybug saves a firefighter from Glaciator's ice creams. Cat Noir brings the man he saved earlier to safety.}}
<poem>
'''Parisian 1''': The two of you are so cute together!
'''[[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]''': ''(confused)'' Uhh, thanks?
''(Ladybug puts the firefighter she saved earlier to safety as well.)''
'''Firefighter''': You guys make a good couple!
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]]''': We're not a couple, we're partners! ''(leaps away)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Place des Vosges]]. Ladybug and Cat Noir continue to battle with Glaciator.}}
<poem>
'''Parisian 2''': ''(while reading a magazine)'' Ah, love is great!
'''Ladybug''': ''(furiously)'' I don't believe this! What's with everybody today? We are ''not'' in love!
'''[[André|Glaciator]]''': You can't deny it! It's in the news!
''(Glaciator points to every billboard of Ladybug and Cat Noir kissing scattered in Paris.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(shocked)'' What?!
''(The duo looks at all of the posters, even the ones on a blimp)''
'''Parisian 2''': ''(holding his magazine)'' Cat Noir, can I have an autograph?
'''Cat Noir''': ''(grabs the magazine)'' "Ladybug and Cat Noir voted Couple of the Year"?
'''Ladybug''': ''(getting furious)'' "They share more than just their love of justice"? What the heck is going on?!
'''Glaciator''': This is proof that my ice cream is right! You two are made for each other like chocolate and strawberries!
'''Ladybug''': ''(furiously)'' This is ''baloney!'' All of these photos are taken out of context! We were fighting supervillains! ''(points at a picture of Ladybug kissing Cat Noir from "Dark Cupid")'' This one is me breaking Cat Noir out of Dark Cupid's spell, ''(points at a picture of Ladybug and Cat Noir kissing from "Oblivio")'' and this one... we can't even remember this one cause the villain erased our memories!
'''Glaciator''': Of course, it's always the supervillain's fault. But the mind forgets and the heart remembers! ''(starts to fire ice creams)''
'''Cat Noir''': Maybe he's right, m'lady. After all, he's still André, the Sweethearts' Ice Cream Maker!
'''Ladybug''': ''(while dodging Glaciator's ice creams)'' Cat Noir, not now! 
''(Glaciator continues to rain ice creams on them.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(while spinning his baton)'' Hey, maybe if we kiss again, our memories would come back!
'''Ladybug''': ''(annoyed)'' Ugh, enough! Why don't you take a little cat nap?! ''(throws Cat Noir into a trash bin, and returns to fight Glaciator, furiously)'' And as for you, you big two-legged ice cream cone, hand over that akumatized scooper right now! 
''(Cat Noir peeks from inside the trash bin, watching Ladybug take down Glaciator on her own.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(off-screen)'' Lucky Charm! A fire extinguisher. Okay. Add this thing, and that one...
'''Glaciator''': ''(off-screen)'' No!
'''Ladybug''': ''(off-screen, furiously; quickly)'' Time to de-evilize! Miraculous Ladybug!
''(The magical ladybugs reverts every damage occurred back to normal. Ladybug swipes open her yo-yo and catches the akuma aggravatedly.)''
'''André''': This doesn't make sense. My ice cream is never wrong! Ladybug and Cat Noir are made for each other!
'''Ladybug''': ''(releases the akuma)'' I guess ice cream, just like tabloids, can be wrong sometimes. 
''(She throws away a picture of Ladybug and Cat Noir from André's ice cream stand. She then stomps her way to the trash bin where she threw Cat Noir in, which caused Cat Noir to panic a little as he closed the bin shut to hide. The trash bin tumbles as Ladybug sends him over the rooftops and eventually falls out the trash bin. Once out, he comes face to face with an annoyed Ladybug.)''
'''Cat Noir''': I guess I'm not your favorite cat at the moment, am I? ''(walks towards Ladybug)'' Can I take you to a movie to make up for it? Or how about a restaurant to celebrate our nomination as Couple of the Year?
'''Ladybug''': ''(yelling)'' We're not "Couple of the Year", we're not a couple ''at all!''
'''Cat Noir''': Sorry! Sorry! I didn't mean to make you so mad. ''(Ladybug simply looks away from him, still mad.)'' I get it. You're sick of me. I might sound like a broken record expressing my affection for you over and over. I know I should stop but... I can't help it, you know? I have so many feelings welled up in this heart, and I don't know how to control them.
'''Ladybug''': ''(sighs)'' I know your heart's in the right place and that you don't mean any harm but—
'''Cat Noir''': ''(dejectedly)'' You're right. You shouldn't have to put up with this. I'll stop. I don't know how yet, but I'll figure it out. I promise.
'''Ladybug''': ''(smiles)'' I'm counting on you.
'''Cat Noir''': ''(frowns)'' I'll see you later. ''(vaults away, and Ladybug eventually to the other direction)''

<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': ''(crestfallen)'' Claws in. ''(de-transforms into Adrien)''
''([[Plagg]] eats a piece of camembert.)''
'''Adrien''': Ladybug's right, Plagg. I don't have the right to force my feelings on her. This has to change. ''I'' have to change! ''(He deletes his photos of Ladybug in his phone and on his computer, although hesitating before doing so.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Césaire apartment]], in [[Alya's room]]. Marinette stands angrily beside Alya, who is currently in front of her computer.}}
<poem>
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]''': You can't do this to me!
'''Marinette''': ''(angrily)'' I said, ''all'' the photos of ''Cat Noir and me'' together!
'''Alya''': What about ''"freedom of the press"''?
'''Marinette''': Sorry, but I need your help with this one.
''(Alya groans, then turns to her computer to delete her pictures of Ladybug and Cat Noir together.)''

<poem>
'''[[Nadja Chamack]]''': ''(on TV)'' Shockwave! Just as Ladybug and Cat Noir have been voted France's Favorite Couple, all images showing the two of them together have disappeared from the Ladyblog, the number one source of information about the Parisians' superheroes. Are Ladybug and Cat Noir no longer an "item"?
'''Marinette''': ''(grabs her monitor aggressively and growls in annoyance)'' We're ''never'' an ''ITEM!''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The [[Agreste mansion]], in [[Adrien's room]]. Adrien watches the news as well.}}
<poem>
'''[[Nadja Chamack]]''': ''(on TV)'' To talk about it with us, here's—
''(Adrien turns off the TV, and frowns.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] Courtyard. [[Armand D'Argencourt|Mr. D'Argencourt]]'s fencing class is in session.}}
<poem>
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': Get into position! 
''(Adrien and his opponent wear their masks on.)''
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': En garde, prêt, allez! 
''(Adrien and his opponent begin to fence, but Adrien tumbles shortly after.)''
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': Attaque, touche. Point.
''(Adrien walks toward the locker room, disheartened, as Kagami watches him with concern.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Collège Françoise Dupont]], in the locker room. Adrien walks out of the boys' comfort room; where Kagami is sitting in front of him.}}
<poem>
'''[[Kagami Tsurugi|Kagami]]''': Me defeating you all the time is normal. But just anyone defeating you worries me. If you have a problem, let me help you.
'''Adrien''': ''(grabs his bag and walks to the door)'' No one can help me, Kagami.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Exterior, [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]. Adrien enters their family car and drives away from the school. He starts to cry, clenching his shaking fist.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': ''(to [[Adrien's bodyguard|Gorilla]], sobbing)'' Can you stop here, please?
''(The car stops in front of Place des Vosges. Adrien steps out of the car and sits on one of the benches as he continue to cry. He spots a billboard of him as Cat Noir with Ladybug together, which makes him even more miserable.)'' 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair]]. The lair window opens.}}
<poem>
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]]''': I feel a devastating disappointment, ''(a butterfly lands in his hand, and corrupts it)'' a sense of guilt! ''(gasps in realization)'' Adrien? ''(looks at his hand where he holds the akuma, contemplating, but releases it anyway)'' Reverse morphosis! ''(de-transforms into Gabriel)''
''(Gabriel brings out his phone to call Gorilla.)''
'''Gabriel''': Your job is to drive Adrien back home immediately after his fencing class. Go get him! Now! ''(ends the call)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|Dupain-Cheng residence]], on the balcony. Marinette paces back and forth angrily while on the phone.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': I don't call that a ''monetizing informational space'', sir, I call it ''visual pollution!'' ''(the person on the other side of the phone replies)'' How much would it cost to get that poster removed? ''(gasps)'' ''That'' much?? Can I pay in thirty-five hundred installments? ''(gasps as she sees Adrien sitting alone in the park, sad)'' Adrien? ''(the person on the other side of the phone speaks again)'' Uh— Yeah, but um... go ahead and leave the poster there. Bye! Love ya— Uh— I mean, goodbye! ''(ends the call)'' Tikki! Adrien is sad! "Operation: Bye-bye, Blues" is a go!!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|Dupain-Cheng residence]] In [[Marinette's room]].  Marinette goes through her chest full of gifts.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(while searching through the gift boxes)'' A present for Adrien's name day, for the mock final exam of the year, in case he ever gets a cast... quick! We got to get to the park before he leaves!
'''Tikki''': ''(holds out a red gift box)'' Is it this one?
Marinette: ''(grabs the red gift box)'' Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Place des Vosges]]. Marinette puts on an act, walking across Adrien as if she hadn't known that he was already there until he notices her.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': Marinette?
'''Marinette''': Oh, Adrien! Fancy seeing you here! And you look so sad, that's good! I mean, no, of course, it's not. It's sad that you're sad but I just happen to be at shopping, and have with me by an incredible coincidence the perfect thing to bring back your smile. So, umm... gift! ''(hands over to him the red gift box)''
'''Adrien''': Oh, uh, thanks! ''(opens the gift box)'' Wow! I've always dreamed of having a hamster! How did you know they were my favorite animal? You read my heart like no one can, Marinette.
'''Marinette''': It's... It's 'cause I love you, Adrien.
'''Adrien''': ''(puts down the gift and stands up from the bench)'' In that case, you must know what my heart wants more than anything right now.
'''Marinette''': No, what?
'''Adrien''': A hamster wheel!
''(Marinette's daydream gets cut off as she realized she gave him the wrong gift.)''
'''Marinette''': No! This one is just in case they bring back the film or... oh— where— nothing. ''(throws the box in the trash bin)'' This wasn't the perfect gift at all!
'''Adrien''': That's a shame. A cool gift like that could be useful.
'''Marinette''': It's not cool or useful! The garbage can is the perfect place for useless stuff that you can just forget about.
'''Adrien''': ''(sadly)'' The garbage can, right. ''(sees his bodyguard waiting outside the park)'' I have to go. Bye, Marinette. ''(walks away)''
'''Marinette''': ''(groans)'' I've messed everything up again!
''(The Tsurugi car honks from the other side of the park, which Marinette notices, confused.)''

{{Scene|Scene: Interior, [[Agreste mansion]], Adrien enters Gabriel's atelier. Gorilla closes the door.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': I'd like to speak to you, Adrien.
'''Adrien''': ''(apathetically)'' As you wish, Father.
'''Gabriel''': Umm, is everything alright?
'''Adrien''': ''(apathetically)'' Yes, Father.
'''Gabriel''': Good. ''(Adrien walks to the door but he stops him)'' Adrien, since your mother disappeared, I... must've been distant, but...
'''Adrien''': I don't blame you, Father.
'''Gabriel''': I want you to know that, if you needed to, you could... talk to me. 
'''Adrien''': If I needed to, Father, I would. ''(walks out the door)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, [[Agreste mansion]], Adrien's room.}}
<poem>
'''Plagg''': Wow! Your father actually said three whole sentences! All those warm feelings, enough to melt a wheel of raclette! Oh, raclette cheese! What a great idea!
'''Adrien''': ''(angrily)'' I don't wanna be like my father, tied to a memory of something that can never be again! Plagg, claws out!
''(He transforms into Cat Noir and jumps out of the window.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The Tsurugi car, outside the Place des Vosges.}}
<poem>
'''Kagami''': I'm worried about Adrien. His sword has lost its edge.
'''Marinette''': His what? ''(Kagami silences her, raising her hand)''
'''Kagami''': Since you're both so weak, I mean sensitive, you understand him best and could him be happy again.
'''Marinette''': I'm not weak— ''(Kagami silences her again)''
'''Kagami''': You must hurry and declare your love for him, so that the flow of your kind words waters the sharpening stone that's his heart again. And that way, Adrien will get his edge back.
'''Marinette''': I didn't get a th— ''(Kagami silences her for the third time)''
'''Kagami''': The problem is that your technique to get Adrien to fall for you is terrible. The art of attraction is like combat, and to win in combat you need training. You are Tori, the attacker, so you need Uke, the defender.
'''Marinette''': Tori? Uke?
'''Kagami''': You need to find someone you have no feelings for. That way you can practice your attraction techniques with that person without your emotions getting in the way.
'''Marinette''': Isn't that a little weird?
'''Kagami''': Weirder than what you usually do? It's a proven technique. Very, even books written about it.
'''Marinette''': But what if... the person I'm practicing on falls for me? Since I don't feel the same way, couldn't there be awful consequences?
'''Kagami''': That's why you must be sure that the person you pick has zero chance of falling for you. I'm counting on you.
''(Marinette steps out of the car and the Tsurugi car drives away.)''
'''Marinette''': But who can I find to do this weird Tori-Uke thingamajig with?
'''Tikki''': I can play Adrien if you want!
'''Marinette''': That's sweet of you, Tikki! I may be imaginative, but I think I'll need at least a human on this one.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On the rooftops.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': Cataclysm! ''(disintegrates a billboard of him and Ladybug)'' Claws in! ''(de-transforms into Adrien)''
'''Plagg''': ''(groans)'' Have mercy! You know I love cheese, but even I'm starting to get sick of it!
'''Adrien''': We must cataclysm all traces of my love for Ladybug! 
'''Plagg''': All of them?
''(The scene zooms out to show all of the billboards of Ladybug and Cat Noir)''
'''Adrien''': Plagg, claws out!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|Dupain-Cheng residence]], on the balcony. Marinette scrolls over her phone contacts.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': No... nope... no, that'd be way too weird. Ugh, it's impossible! I'll never be able to find anyone to practice on! ''(spots Cat Noir on a nearby rooftop)'' Oh! Cat Noir! He's the perfect choice! There's no way he has any feelings for me— well, for the other me, yes, but not for the ''real me'' me!
'''Tikki''': Isn't it kind of strange that he's out here all alone when nobody has been akumatized?
'''Marinette''': Aw, cat on a rooftop, what could be more normal? Hide, Tikki!
''(Tikki phases through her purse.)''
'''Marinette''': Cat Noir!
''(Cat Noir turns to see Marinette.)''
'''Marinette''': Here, kitty, kitty!
''(Cat Noir jumps to Marinette's balcony.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Marinette Dupain-Cheng, is everything okay?
'''Marinette''': Yeah, perfect timing, actually! I need a boyfriend.
'''Cat Noir''': A boyfriend? Oh, no no no! I'm done with all that lovey-dovey stuff! I'm not in love with anyone, and don't plan it on anytime soon.
'''Marinette''': Then, that's perfect! Exactly what I need. See, I have a problem with my boyfriend, who's not my boyfriend yet, because I can't talk to him about how I feel, so I need someone to play my crush, who for sure doesn't have a crush on me, and you'd be perfect for the role since there's no way you'd fall for me, since you don't love anyone!
'''Cat Noir''': No one, exactly! And I mean no one! But, uh, I still don't get it. You need me to do what exactly?
'''Marinette''': To play my boyfriend who's not my boyfriend yet! And I'll play the girlfriend, but the girlfriend who does things right, who doesn't mess up everything she says. Know what I mean?
'''Cat Noir''': Uh, not much more than before?
'''Marinette''': Great! Let's do this then. ''(lets Cat Noir sit on a chair)'' You sit there, and I'll come in. ''(takes a deep breath and reads her confession on a paper)'' Dear Cat Noir, ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you, they make me melt until the slightest thought has reduced to droplets! Those suns are only three little words, but they're burning my lips! Please soothe me, Cat Noir, and tell me that you love me as much as I love you—
'''Cat Noir''': Uh, Marinette? Sorry, I'm really flattered, but, like I told you, I'm not in love with anyone.
'''Marinette''': Of course! I'm not talking to ''you''! This is for the boyfriend who's not really my boyfriend yet!
'''Cat Noir''': Ah, got it! But since you said Cat Noir, I thought you were actually talking to me.
'''Marinette''': Oh, right, shoot!
'''Cat Noir''': Well, what's your boyfriend's name?
'''Marinette''': Uh— that's private...
'''Cat Noir''': ''(groans)'' That's not gonna make things any easier.
'''Marinette''': Okay... Buttercup.
'''Cat Noir''': ''(chuckles)'' His name is "Buttercup"?
'''Marinette''': Of course, that's not his real name, it's a code name! Come on, start over. ''(pushes Cat Noir back on his seat)'' Dear Buttercup, ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my—
''(Cat Noir cackles)''
'''Marinette''': Come on, would you please concentrate? This is serious!
'''Cat Noir''': Sorry! It's the Buttercup name. ''(clears throat)''
'''Marinette''': Dear Buttercup, ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whe—
''(Cat Noir makes a silly, grumpy face.)''
'''Marinette''': What's with the face? Are you hurting or something?
'''Cat Noir''': Uhh, I'm being serious.
'''Marinette''': Uh, well, okay, that's not being helpful at all. Be serious, but not serious like you're trying to solve a math problem.
''(Cat Noir chuckles nervously.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(a little aggressive)'' Dear Buttercup, ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my—
'''Cat Noir''': I'm sorry, Marinette, but what face am I supposed to make then?
'''Marinette''': ''(angrily)'' Who cares!?
'''Cat Noir''': I don't know, you're the one who was saying—
'''Marinette''': I know! It doesn't matter how you feel right now, I'm the one training here! Just act like you're a little interested in me! It's good to be interested in other people now and then, you know? Always me, me, me! ''(pushes Cat Noir again on his seat)'' Let's start over.

'''Marinette''': ''(more aggressively)'' Dear Buttercup!! Ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you, they—
'''Cat Noir''': Woah, that's the most beautiful thing anyone has ever said to me!
'''Marinette''': But I hardly said anything!
'''Cat Noir''': I know, but the way you open your mouth was just so moving, it was like the skies after the storm, like a rainbow sweeping my heart!
'''Marinette''': You're overdoing it.
'''Cat Noir''': You think?
'''Marinette''': Yes. Really. 
''(She pushes him back on his seat)''
'''Marinette''': ''(hastily and annoyed)'' Dear Buttercup! Ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you— ''(Cat Noir stands to interrupt her)'' What is it now!?
'''Cat Noir''': Uh, well, if you don't mind me saying, now it sounds like you're mad at me instead of in love with me.
'''Marinette''': ''(furious)'' I'm not mad! I'm declaring my love to you, isn't it obvious?
'''Cat Noir''': Let's just say it could be more obvious.
'''Marinette''': Alright, since you're so good at this, show ''me'' how it's done. I'll be you, and you'll be me. Come on. 
''(She switches places with Cat Noir and glares at him as she takes her seat.)'' 
'''Cat Noir''': Dear Buttercup, ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you, they make me melt until the slightest thought has reduced to droplets! Those suns are only three little words, but they're burning my lips! Please soothe me, Buttercup, and tell me that you love me as much as I love you!
'''Marinette''': ''(stands up)'' Wait a minute, do I sound ''that'' corny when I'm saying it?
'''Cat Noir''': I'm just performing, you know? I'm not here to judge the wording.
'''Marinette''': Oh man, this is awful! I'll never be able to do this.
'''Cat Noir''': Boy, you sure like to take the hard route. You put too much pressure on yourself. Of course, you'll be able to do it. I know, let's take a short break, just to air our heads out.
'''Cat Noir and Marinette''': Movie?
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Inside a bus. Marinette and Cat Noir climb aboard.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Is there a problem?
'''Cat Noir''': Well, actually, I always travel by stick, I don't have change for a ticket.
'''Bus driver''': This one's on me, Cat Noir! You've saved us so many times, it's the least I can do.
'''Cat Noir''': Thanks! I me-owe you one!
'''Bus driver''': You're welcome!
'''Commuter''': Bravo, Cat Noir, bravo!
''(Marinette and Cat Noir walk to the back of the bus.)''
'''Cat Noir''': What movies are playing?
'''Marinette''': "Little Love Notes". We're trying to think of something else, so no romantic comedies. "Captain Supreme: the Ultimate Duel?"
'''Cat Noir''': Could we possibly avoid films about superheroes?
'''Marinette''': Got it. What about "Sharktank vs. Mechatiger"?
''(Andre is seen stopping by the bus window and notices the two of them, making him frown.)'' 
'''Cat Noir''': With a title like that, I think we should be safe!
''(Both of them chuckle.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, Cinema. Marinette and Cat Noir sit beside each other.}}
<poem>
'''Mechatiger''': ''(from the movie screen, v.o)'' Sharktank, don't die! I've always loved you!
'''Sharktank''': ''(from the movie screen, v.o)'' Me too, Mechatiger, but it's impossible! We're sworn enemies!
'''Cat Noir''': But they don't even have mouths! How are they supposed to kiss?
'''Marinette''': Uh, it's been written in advance, so everything's planned out. But in real life, you have no idea how it's gonna go. Just because you tell someone you love them doesn't mean the other will love you back just like that!
'''Cat Noir''': Tell me about it. If only love could be so easy.
'''Marinette''': That's why it's so scary to tell someone you love them. Even saving the world seems easy comparing to it. Well, I suppose it is. I mean, just look at you! When you have to save the world with Ladybug, you just bulldoze ahead, you don't think about it! A couple of jokes, and bam! Cataclysm, Lucky Charm, Miraculous Ladybug! And everything's back to normal. Easy as pie.
'''Cat Noir''': Yeah, that's the short version, but it sounds about right.
'''Marinette''': But telling someone you love them? If it doesn't work out, it's your heart that gets cataclysm-ed, and no Miraculous Ladybug can repair that. That's why I never get anywhere with boys. When things are really important to me, I get so scared that it won't work out that I can't help trying to control every possible outcome! I tell myself stories with wedding dresses, and hamsters, and what people see is not Marinette opening her heart up. It's Marinette talking about some ridiculous nonsense she's made up.
'''Cat Noir''': I like hamsters, too.
'''Audience''': And I like to watch the movie in peace and quiet!
''(They both laugh.)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Outside the Cinema. Cat Noir and Marinette walk out as Cat Noir opens an umbrella from his baton.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': You have an umbrella option in your stick?
'''Cat Noir''': Well, yeah! Cats don't like water. ''(The two of them begin to walk together.)'' It's funny, you know? I'm kind of the opposite of you. I know that Ladybug is not in love with me, but I can't help telling her how I feel. I wish I could fall in love with someone else, but I can't. She's just so incredible! I'm so afraid I'm not the good person I thought I was, and now I've gone too far and she hates me.
'''Marinette''': ''(smiles)'' She doesn't hate you.
'''Cat Noir''': She threw me in the trash today.
'''Marinette''': You're a good cat. I'm sure you'll figure out what to do.
'''André''': ''(after noticing Marinette and Cat Noir together)'' But it can't be! Ladybug and Cat Noir are supposed to be made for each other. I've lost my connection with my ice cream! I don't understand what it's trying to tell me anymore!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair]]. The lair window opens for the second time.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': Akumatization is like ice cream; once you've tasted it, you'll always come back for more! ''(creates an akuma and releases it)'' Fly away, my evil akuma, and bring me back two scoops of despair!
''(The akuma flies out of the window.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|Dupain-Cheng residence]], on the balcony. Marinette and Cat Noir land back safely.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': Thanks for flying Cat Noir Airways. We hope you'll be fe-lying again soon.
'''Marinette''': ''(laughs)'' Thanks! That was nice.
'''Cat Noir''': My pleasure.
''(They kiss each other on their cheeks. Cat Noir is about to leap away but halts a second later.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Oh, wait! Your training!
'''Marinette''': Oh, shoot! I forgot about that!
'''Cat Noir''': Quick! Back into position. You can totally do it this time! I just know it!
'''Marinette''': Dear—
'''Glaciator''': Ladybug and Cat Noir are the ones who should be in love, not you two! My ice cream never lies!
'''Cat Noir''': Again?
'''Marinette''': No, no, no! We're not in love, it's just practice!
''(Glaciator starts shooting ice creams on Marinette's balcony as the two of them make their escape. Cat Noir scoops up Marinette and puts her to safety in an alley.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Stay here. ''(leaps away)''
'''Tikki''': Glaciator re-akumatized? But that's impossible! You gave André a magical charm earlier, didn't you?
'''Marinette''': Oh, no! I was so annoyed with that whole Couple of the Year thing that I totally forgot to give it to him! Tikki, spots on! ''(transforms into Ladybug and swings out the alley as well)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the Parisian Streets. Glaciator chases after Cat Noir. The villain kicks a car towards Cat Noir's direction and shortly gets blocked by Ladybug. Glaciator continues to fire ice creams at them as the superheroes run to hide.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': Nice to see you again, my... dear friend whom I respect and for whom I have no other feelings than true platonic friendship.
'''Ladybug''': Are you making fun of me?
'''Cat Noir''': Not at all! I'm... just getting my bearings.
'''Ladybug''': [[Lucky Charm]]! ''(uses her power as a [[List of Lucky Charm objects|car]] drops in front of them)''
'''Cat Noir''': Oh, yeah! That lucky charm really revs my engine!
''(Ladybug closes her eyes, coming up with a plan to use her lucky charm. The scene zooms to the big exhaust in front of Gare du Nord.)''
'''Ladybug''': Okay! Take the wheel. I got a plan.
'''Glaciator''': There you are! You think you can escape me like that?
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir step in the car. Cat Noir starts the car engine and drives away, escaping Glaciator as the villain comtinues to chase them.)''
'''Glaciator''': ''(sing-song)'' I'm Glaciator, the mean ice-cream man, and I am your number 1 fan!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(while driving)'' That's enough! We're just friends!
'''Ladybug''': Okay. Let's go! ''(hurls her yo-yo, tying it around Glaciator and on her car seat)'' Pass me the wheel.
'''Glaciator''': You think you can escape me by attaching me to you?
'''Cat Noir''': Where are we going with this—? I mean, not the two of us. Just... where are we going, like, a direction?
'''Ladybug''': I got it. We're heading to the Gare du Nord. We'll stay in touch. ''(She continues to drive, escaping Glaciator.)'' Cat Noir, now! 
''(Cat Noir jumps out of the car.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(through the ear-piece)'' You know what to do. Come back as soon as you're ready!
'''Cat Noir''': Drive safe. ''(He leaps to rooftop where a billboard of him and Ladybug is located. He drops it to the ground to use it as a ramp for Ladybug's car.)'' Ready, m'lady! Uh, do you mind me calling you "m'lady"? 
'''Ladybug''': No, that's okay. ''(performs a drift)'' It's not that complicated, you know? If I tell you that something's annoying, you stop doing it, that's all!
''(Ladybug drives to the ramp with Glaciator still tied up to the car with her yo-yo and flies in the air, with Glaciator flying atop the big exhaust and melts his ice cream body. 
'''Cat Noir''': Cataclysm! 
''(He leaps in and destroys the akumatized ice scream scooper, sending the akuma fluttering out of the object. He then catches André from falling.)''
'''Ladybug''': No more evil-doing for you, little akuma! ''(swipes open her yo-yo)'' Time to de-evilize! ''(captures the akuma)'' Gotcha! ''(opens her yo-yo and releases the purified butterfly)'' Bye-bye, little butterfly! [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]!! ''(She throws the car keys in the air and organizes all the chaos caused by Glaciator. She opens her yo-yo again and grabs a [[Magical Charms|magical charm]] to give to André.)'' I forgot to give this to you last time. Keep it on your cart with you. It should protect you in the future.
'''André''': Thank you, Ladybug! ''(walks away)''
'''Ladybug''': I knew you could do it! ''(raises her fist)''
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir''': Pound it!
'''Cat Noir''': Oh! I just remembered. I gotta hurry. I've got something I need to finish. ''(vaults away)''
'''Ladybug''': I better hurry, too. ''(swings away)''

{{Scene|Scene: The [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|Dupain-Cheng residence]], on the balcony. Marinette and Cat Noir continue where they left off with their practice.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': This time's the one. You'll see! ''(takes his seat and smiles at Marinette)''
'''Marinette''': Ever since I've met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you... ''(stops and frowns)''
'''Cat Noir''': That was a good start. What's wrong?
'''Marinette''': What's wrong is that this is not really me. ''(crumples the paper)'' The first time I saw you, I misjudged you. I thought you were conceited and superficial. But then, I got to know you. I saw who you really were deep down—someone sweet, sincere, and generous. Since then, there's something I've been wanting to tell you. But every time I try, it's like my brain suddenly freezes. But now, I think I'm ready. I love you.
'''Cat Noir''': Your declaration was beautiful, Marinette. The boy you're in love with is a lucky guy.
'''Marinette''': Thanks! The girl who falls in love with you will be lucky, too.
'''[[Tom Dupain|Tom]]''': ''(from downstairs)'' Marinette?
'''Marinette''': My dad!
''(Cat Noir leaps away from her balcony.)''
'''Tom''': ''(from downstairs)'' Marinette?
'''Marinette''': Coming, Dad! ''(enters her trapdoor)''

{{Scene|Scene: [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] Courtyard. A fencing competition ensues. Adrien claims victory and holds up a trophy. Marinette is watching very happily but gets pulled out by Kagami shortly after and they head to the locker room.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Hey! What's going—
'''Kagami''': Did you do what I told you to?
'''Marinette''': Uh— kind of? I mean, not yet.
'''Kagami''': Good. I was worried, 'cause that's a very risky technique. When you start practicing with a boy, you could fall in love with him, and then you might run away together to a desert island where you might get attacked by zombie carnivorous plants.
'''Marinette''': ''(confused)'' What?
'''Kagami''': ''(holds up a manga book)'' And I haven't even finished Volume 3 yet. But I think it gets even worse later.
'''Marinette''': Hang on. You've been giving me advice that you got from a ''manga?''
'''Kagami''': From "The Robinsons of the Catastrophe". Why shouldn't I?
'''Marinette''': ''(shakes her head)'' Kagami, Kagami, Kagami. You really need to spend more time with me and the gang. ''(Kagami looks surprised)''

{{Scene|Scene: Interior, [[Agreste mansion]], Adrien's room. Adrien places the trophy he won on his shelf and proceeds to sit in front of his computer. He turns it on and retrieves his pictures of Ladybug that he deleted earlier.}}
<poem>
'''Plagg''': I thought you've given up with Ladybug?
'''Adrien''': Marinette opened my eyes. The thing is, I'm always doing my Cat Noir act with her. Maybe if I were my true self with Ladybug, she'd fall in love with me.
''(Plagg groans in annoyance.)''
