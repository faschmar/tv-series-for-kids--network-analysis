{{Scene|Scene: [[Césaire apartment]]. [[Alya Césaire|Alya]], [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]], [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]], and the Césaire family are all sitting at the table, while [[Marlena Césaire]] is serving food.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Mmm. Everything smells delicious, Mrs. Césaire!
'''Marlena''': Marinette, call me Marlena. ''(places a dish in front of Marinette)'' You'll let me know how you like my Colombo, okay?
''(Marinette smiles. Marlena walks away. Marinette looks down and sees [[Trixx]] floating over the table with a small plate, fork and knife set in front of him.) ''
'''Marinette''': Hide, Trixx! ''(to Alya)'' Alya, no one can know about Trixx! He's a secret!
'''Alya''': ''(to Marinette)'' Really? Exactly why is he such a secret, '''Ladybug'''?
''(Marinette turns around the table to see everyone staring at her, smiling.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(stammering)'' U-uh, Ladybug? W-Why are you calling me Ladybug? I'm not Ladybug. I'm Marinette! Just a normal girl with a normal life. 
'''Nino''': ''(laughing)'' Marinette, everyone knows that you're Ladybug!
'''[[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]''': To think that you've been lecturing us about blah, blah, blah, "you must keep your identity a secret," blah, blah, blah, "otherwise I can't give you your Miraculous." I would have made a much better Ladybug. Talk about a ridiculous Guardian, utterly ridiculous!
'''Marinette''': ''(questioning)'' Alya, what is she doing here at your house?
''([[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]] knocks the window)''
'''Alya''': Ahh, thanks for showing up, Shadow Moth! 
''(Marinette gets shocked and Alya opens the window)''
'''Shadow Moth''': I'm the one grateful to you, for revealing Ladybug's identity, Alya. Thanks to you, the Miracle Box is finally mine.
'''Marinette''': Alya?! This is impossible! Tikki, Spots On! ''(failed to transform)'' Tikki?
'''[[Tikki]]''': ''(angrily replies)'' You should have never trusted Alya, Marinette.
''([[Adrien Agreste|Cat Blanc]] appears and holds Marinette)''
'''Cat Blanc''': Look on the bright side, m'lady. Now that we're done with secrets, we can tie the knot.
'''Marinette''': ''(afraid)'' This... is... a nightmare...!
'''Shadow Moth''': If you want this to stop, all you have to do is give me your Miraculous.
''(Everyone approaches Marinette)''
'''Trixx''': This is what you get for leaving me with Alya.
''(Marinette screams.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. She awakens and sits up in shock. Tikki, who was sleeping on her chest, was catapulted to the end of Marinette's bed.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': AHHHHHH! Tikki, I should have never left the Fox Miraculous with Alya!
''(Tikki wakes up and rushes on the box)''
'''Tikki''': ''(yawns)'' What are you talking about, Marinette?
'''Marinette''': ''(opens the sewing box)'' I had a nightmare. It was horrible! Alya told everyone, everything and Shadow Moth had hold of the Miracle Box.
''(The Miracle Box appears safe and sound, and Marinette gets relieved)''
'''Marinette''': Whew.
'''Tikki''': It was just a bad dream, that wouldn't really happen. Alya is a loyal friend.
'''[[Wayzz]]''': Alya is. But her kwami, Trixx, can't help making mischief whenever is facing to whom.
'''[[Xuppu]]''': Well the Loch Ness monster illusion was kind of fun, wasn't it?
'''Tikki''': Shhh.
'''Marinette''': ''(in fear)'' That was a prophetic nightmare, I can't leave the Miraculous with Alya!
''(she runs down the stairs)''
'''Tikki''': Marinette, wait!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Bakery}}
<poem>
''(Marinette opens the door in rush to see Alya)''
'''[[Sabine Cheng|Sabine]]''': Marinette, it's almost lunchtime and you're still...
'''Marinette''': In my pajamas, ''(facepalms)'' I know, I, I just need to drop by Alya's, and there's this thing I need back. ''(in a rush, so she quickly explain to her parents)''
''(She runs out the door.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Alya's home}}
<poem>
''(Marinette opens the door)''
'''Alya''': Where did that thing go? Come on, Nora.
'''[[Nora Césaire|Nora]]''': If I find him, he better be ready for a good old roundhouse kick!
'''[[Ella Césaire|Ella]]''': First one who finds the furry squishy gets to keep it.
'''[[Etta Césaire|Etta]]''': Yeah!
'''[[Otis Césaire|Otis]]''': I can't believe this, it's like the little monster can go through walls or something.
'''Marinette''': Everyone knows? You-you told them?!
'''Alya''': Well, I had to since I lost him. Imagine what happened if someone could cross him or worse if he escaped. ''(Marinette facepalms)''
'''Marinette''': You ''lost'' him?
'''Alya''': Yeah, so? Everybody loses things from time to time. Help me look instead of lecturing me.
'''Marlena''': Stay for lunch, Marinette. You let me know, how you like my Colombo, okay?
'''Marinette''': ''(in fear, notices a tarantula crawling from the pot and screams)'' A T-T-T-Tarantula! ''(points to the bug while holding Alya's arm).''
'''Marlena''': ''(notices and starts to laugh)'' Everyone can stop looking. Marinette found Hannibal!
'''Nora and Alya''': Phew! ''(sigh in relief that Hannibal has been found).''
'''Otis''': Seems like he got his legs working again. Tomorrow, it's back to the zoo, buddy.
'''Nino''': ''(voiceover)'' Is it okay to come out now?
''(The girls turn around to see that Nino was there.)''
'''Nora''': ''(starts to laugh)'' Ha! You flyweights, Cappy was scared of the itsy-bitsy spider, just like you, baguette!
'''Nino''': ''(comes out from the room)'' Nah, I wasn't scared, I just went into the bathroom to make sure that Hannibal had not fallen into the toilet. ''(notices Marinette in her pajamas and questions her)'' But why are you in your pajamas?
''(Marinette looks down to see that she is in her pajamas)''
'''Alya''': Cute look, Marinette. So, are you here for anything... specific?
'''Marinette''': ''(laughs nervously)'' Oh! No, it's cool! Nothing specific, especially now I've seen you found the tarantula, I'm so relieved it wasn't something else that you'd lost. 
'''Alya''': Ah, I know what ''thing'' you're talking about, FYI, when someone trusts me with a "thing," I don't lose it.
''(Alya's parents seems confused about what they're saying.)''
'''Nora''': ''(laughs)'' Look who's talking! You're the one who just lost Hannibal.
'''Marinette''': Huh. Can we chat for a sec? ''(pulls Alya along to her bedroom)''
'''Alya''': Sorry, Nino. This is between Marinette and me. ''(closes her door)''
''(Nino looks a bit sad that Alya doesn't let him in to her room.)''
'''Nino''': (seems sad and then he screams when he notices the tarantula) Ahh! Haha, haha (starts to laugh a bit).
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Alya's room}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(walks back and forth)'' I swear, it was so... lifelike!
'''Alya''': It was just a nightmare, Marinette. 
'''Marinette''': Everyone knew that I was... ''(her eyes move from side to side)'' you-know-who, you know? ''(the phone rings)'' AAAAHHH!
'''Alya''': Chill out, everything's cool!
'''Marinette''': ''(sighs heavily)'' Okay. We know that Shadow Moth has identified some of the holders. He knows you've been Rena Rouge! What if he found out I left the Miraculous with you? He could steal it from you!
'''Alya''': Shadow Moth or anybody else will never know! ''(turns to look at the door where the sound of the telephone ringing)''
'''Marinette''': Not even Cat Noir can!
'''Alya''': No one's gonna find this! ''(holds out her Fox necklace)'' And thanks to this very hip bag my BFF gave me, ''(unzips her fanny pack as Trixx emerges from it)'' Trixx is always with me, out of sight.
'''Marinette''': Trixx! Promise you're not gonna... make any mischief like popping up at the table during lunch, for example? 
'''Trixx''': As silent as a phoenix and as wily as foxes. ''(high-fives with Alya)''
'''Tikki''': ''(flies to Marinette's side)'' I told you everything is alright!
'''Marinette''': I was silly to worry. You're right.
'''Alya''': Trust me, and trust yourself! You were right to give me a Mirac- ''(gets annoyed by the continuous phone ringing)'' Ugh, seriously? Hello?? Why isn't anybody getting that? ''(storms out of the room)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Césaire's Living Room}}
<poem>
''(Alya looks outside her room only to find out that there is already nobody there. The phone continues to ring.)''
'''Alya''': Hey! Where'd you guys all go? Is this some kind of joke? ''(picks up the phone)'' Hello?
'''Shadow Moth''': (''on the phone'') Rena Rouge, I am Shadow Moth.
''(Alya hears Marinette screaming from behind, she turns around to find Marinette already caught by one of the bubbles.)''
'''Alya''': Marinette! ''(shocked, she turns to look at dining table, where the supervillain who appears to be the Bubbler is standing.)''
''(Marinette's bubble starts to float outside.)''
'''Marinette''': Alya!
'''Alya''': ''(runs to the balcony, chasing after Marinette's bubble)'' Marinette, no!
'''Marinette''': Alya! Be careful! ''(her bubble continues to float away)''
''(Alya turns angrily to look at the Bubbler in their living room.)''
'''Alya''': Nino! Seriously? Don't tell me you got akumatized into Bubbler again just 'cause I didn't let you in my room!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(speaks through the "Bubbler")''  I'm not Nino, I'm the [[Sentibubbler (sentimonster)|Sentibubbler]].
'''Sentibubbler''': Nino is with your family, all prisoners!
''(Alya runs back to the balcony to see her whole family, Marinette, Nino,  including their tarantula, imprisoned in Sentibubbler's bubbles up in the sky.)''
'''Nino''': ''(sees the tarantula floating towards him and tries to move away from it)'' Hey, you! Keep those hairy legs away from me, okay?
'''Nora''': ''(sitting calmly inside her bubble)'' Don't panic, the Beetle and Mr. Whiskers will save us!
''(Back at Alya's home, she looks back at Sentibubbler, signaling her to pick up the phone and winks at her. Alya picks up the phone eventually.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(on the phone)'' You've probably realized by now ''(scene changes at the rooftop where he is standing)'' that you'll have to obey me if you want to see your loved ones again. 
''(scene changes back to Alya's home)''
'''Alya''': What do you want, Shadow Moth?
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(on the phone)'' I want you to ''betray'' Ladybug!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sky, from Marinette's bubble}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': This is worse than a nightmare! Tikki, I can't transform or everyone will see me!
'''Tikki''': Alya will figure something out. That's why you left her a Miraculous!
'''Marinette''': ''(grabs her phone from her purse)'' I have to tell her that the villain is probably a sentimonster! ''(starts typing on her phone)'' Rena Rouge has to warn Cat Noir that he must '''not''' cataclysm him, or the sentimonster will get out of control and our bubbles could pop out!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Césaire Residence.}}
<poem>
''(Alya's phone vibrates from her pocket. She grabs it and sees a message from Marinette but one of Sentibubbler's bubbles eventually takes Alya's phone away.)''
'''Alya''': No!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(on the phone)'' The only people you'll be able to communicate with now, Alya Césaire, are me and my sentimonster!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sky, in Marinette's bubble}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(nervously tapping her phone)'' Why isn't she answering? ''(sees Alya's phone float across her)'' Oh no. 
'''Tikki''': Trust Alya, Marinette. She's never let you down before!
'''Marinette''': You're right! Besides, I'm sure Cat Noir will show up soon! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Agreste mansion]], in Adrien's bedroom.}}
<poem>
'''[[Nadja Chamack]]''': ''(on TV)'' These bubbles are floating for over five minutes now, and still no superhero in sight. Isn't that right, Clara?
'''[[Plagg]]''': ''(sniffs on the camembert on the table)'' Aww, this cheese isn't runny enough yet.
'''[[Clara Contard]]''': ''(on TV)'' Yes, Nadja, and no villain either. In fact, these bubbles are identical to the ones created by the Bubbler. Yet, in one of them, there's Nino Lahiffe, the student that was originally akumatized as the Bubbler.
'''Nadja''': ''(on TV)'' Keep your distance, Clara. Don't take any risks until Ladybug and Cat Noir get there.
'''Adrien''': ''(worried)'' Nino! Marinette! ''(stands up)'' Plagg?
'''Plagg''': ''(smiling)'' Well, good! By the time we're back, maybe this cheese will become edible!

{{Scene|Scene: Césaire Residence.}}
<poem>
''(Alya is still on the phone talking to Shadow Moth.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Listen carefully. Ladybug will be here any minute. And since it's your family and friends, Ladybug will ask you to help her, and hand you the Miraculous of the Fox. Once she's given you the Miraculous, the Sentibubbler will be hiding nearby and capture Ladybug!
'''Alya''': Cat Noir will come to save her!
'''Shadow Moth''': No. He won't even know she's been captured. Because thanks to your Miraculous, you'll transform into Rena Rouge and create an illusion of Ladybug ''and'' Rena Rouge to distract Cat Noir. Thinking he's joined his fellow heroes, he won't notice the Sentibubbler until it's too late, and you'll give me your Miraculous! It is then and ''only'' then when the three Miraculous are finally in my possession! That, the Sentibubbler will release your loved ones. If you try anything to warn Ladybug or Cat Noir, I'll order the Sentibubbler to send the bubbles into space, too far for any superhero to ever save them!
''(Alya looks up to the sky where her family, Nino and Marinette's bubbles are at.)'' 
'''Shadow Moth''': If I were you, I would do anything I could to ensure Ladybug showed up very shortly! 
'''Alya''': ''(puts down the phone while looking up in the sky)'' Got to gain some time!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sky, in Marinette's bubble}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Phew, Alya's still free! She'll be able to save us.
'''Tikki''': ''(from Marinette's purse)'' You see? You were right to give her the Miraculous!
'''Marinette''': Thanks, Tikki. 
'''Alya''': ''(from their balcony)'' Ladybug! Please come save us! 
'''Marinette''': ''(suspicious)'' What's she doing?
'''Alya''': ''(waving her hands)'' Ladybug! Please come save us!
'''Marinette''': Ugh, I'm just gonna have to transform in front of everyone and later use the [[Rabbit Miraculous|Miraculous of the Rabbit]] to go back in time! Ah, no! Time travel is never a good idea! But if I don't transform, I won't have access to any of the Miraculous. Oh! Except mine! ''(looks at Tikki inside her purse)'' You could take it to another holder!
'''Tikki''': The earrings can't go through the bubble, Marinette!
'''Marinette''': Then, Cat Noir is our last hope. 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On the rooftops. Cat Noir is on his cat phone, voice-mailing Ladybug}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': No villain in sight. Watch out, m'lady. I get the feeling someone's trying to play cat and ladybug with us. I'm waiting for you! ''(puts down his cat phone)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: the Césaire Residence}}
<poem>
'''Alya''': ''(continues to wave her hands)'' Yoo-hoo! Ladybug! ''(looks on her fanny pack where Trixx is peeking out)'' ''(softly)'' Get ready, Trixx. We have to figure out a way to free Marinette, or else we're all serious goners! 
''(She looks behind and uses her vision, pointing at the Sentibubbler, the fruit bowl, and her bedroom door.)
'''Alya''': Hey, Sentibubbler? I have to go to the bathroom.
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(annoyed)'' Not now!
'''Sentibubbler''': ''(annoyed)'' Not now!
'''Alya''': ''(stomps her feet)'' Seriously, it cannot wait. Must be the stress. Plus, it sure will look weird if Ladybug finds me like this.
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(sighs)'' Just remember that if you try anything...
'''Sentibubbler''': I'll send those bubbles right into space!
'''Alya''': I can't try anything without a Miraculous, anyway. I just need to go to the bath- Woah!
''(Alya trips and the table falls down. She hides behind the table.)'' 
'''Alya''': ''(whispers)'' Trixx, let's pounce! ''(transforms into Rena Rouge and grabs her flute to quickly create an illusion of herself as Alya)'' 
'''Rena Rouge''': ''(whispers)'' [[Mirage]]!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On the rooftops}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': Sentibubbler, what is she doing?
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Césaire residence}}
<poem>
'''Sentibubbler''': Ah, I can't see! 
''("Alya" appears from the table, holding a bowl above her head and places it on their kitchen counter. Rena Rouge makes her move to stay hidden from the Sentibubbler and Shadow Moth. "Alya" continues to walk to the bathroom as the Sentibubbler keeps an eye on her.)''
'''Sentibubbler''': You got thirty seconds!
''("Alya" enters the bathroom. Rena Rouge grabs a bunch of grapes on the floor and sneaks behind the Sentibubbler as he begins to count.)'' 
'''Sentibubbler''': One, two, three...
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Alya's room}}
<poem>
'''Rena Rouge''': ''(softly)'' Reality! (Her illusion of Alya disappears without the Sentibubbler's knowledge.)
'''Sentibubbler''': ''(from outside Alya's room)'' Five! 
'''Rena Rouge''': Let's rest! (detransforms into civilian form and catches Trixx on her hands)
''(She hands over the bunch of grapes to Trixx as he pulls out a piece and bites on it.)
'''Trixx''': You got a plan?
'''Alya''': Uh-huh. Shadow Moth and the Sentibubbler don't know I have my Miraculous with me. I'm going to use it to make them believe everything is going according to their plan. 
'''Trixx''': ''(chewing on his piece of grape)'' You're going to create an illusion of Ladybug?
'''Alya''': Yep. But first, I have to make sure that Cat Noir doesn't come to mess up my plan. Trixx, let's pounce! ''(transforms once again into Rena Rouge)''
''(She opens her fox phone and calls Cat Noir.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On the rooftops.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': ''(answers his cat phone)'' Rena? Are you with Ladybug?
'''Rena Rouge''': ''(from Alya's room)'' Yes. She... asked me to call you and say we got a plan.
'''Cat Noir''': Perfect! What should I do?
'''Rena Rouge''': Oh! Uh- I- It's actually a two-person plan. 
'''Cat Noir''': What do you mean a "two-person plan"? You mean she and you? What about me?
'''Rena Rouge''': Well, that's just it. In this plan, you have to stay right where you are. A-and wait for instructions.
'''Cat Noir''': Hm. I need to hear it from ''her''. Put her on the phone, please.
'''Rena Rouge''': Well, I- Uh-  I can't. She's super busy right now. And, uh, if you happen to see the Bubbler, whatever you do, don't cataclysm him! It's actually a sentimonster.
'''Cat Noir''': What?
'''Rena Rouge''': I gotta go! I-I mean, ''we'' will keep you posted. ''(hangs up)'' Mirage! 
''(She brings back the illusion of herself as Alya, together with an illusion of Ladybug on the rooftops.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(enraged)'' A two-person plan?! There's only ''one'' two-person plan, and that's Ladybug and me! ''(smashes the wall behind him with his stick)'' The Miraculous Ladybug will fix everything as usual. Hm? ''(He sees "Ladybug" jumping over the rooftops alone.)'' Where's Rena Rouge? ''(becomes suspicious and frustrated)'' "Stay where I am," I can't just sit here and do nothing! ''(goes to follow "Ladybug")''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In Marinette's bubble}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(sees the illusion of Ladybug down below)'' Rena Rouge has gone into action, Tikki! I knew Alya could handle it! ''(she then sees Cat Noir follow "Ladybug" from behind)'' Cat Noir! No!
'''Tikki''': What's wrong?
'''Marinette''': If Cat Noir comes into contact with Rena Rouge's illusion anyway, it'll disappear! I've got to warn Cat Noir! ''(attempts to push her bubble forward)'' Or Shadow Moth will figure out Alya's plan! ''(continues to push her bubble forward)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On the rooftop where Shadow Moth is standing.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(sees "Ladybug")'' There she is! ''(as the Sentibubbler)'' Hurry up, Ladybug's coming!
'''Sentibubbler''': ''(to "Alya")'' Hurry up, Ladybug's coming!
'''Alya''': ''(exits the bathroom)'' See? I didn't make trouble.
'''Sentibubbler''': Don't forget what will happen to your loved ones if you don't stick to the plan. ''(hides in a room behind him)''
'''Alya''': I hear you loud and clear. ''(walks to the balcony)''
''(Sentibubbler takes a peek at "Alya" from the room.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Sentibubbler, wait until Ladybug has given the Miraculous to Rena Rouge before you capture her.  
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: On another rooftop, Cat Noir stops to peer over the illusions of Alya and Ladybug.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Cat Noir! Cat Noir!!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(sees Marinette inside a bubble above him)'' Marinette Dupain-Cheng? 
'''Marinette''': You have to stay where you are!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(angrily)'' Oh, come on! What is with everyone telling me to stay where I am?
'''Marinette''': Rena Rouge created an illusion of Ladybug to fool the Bubbler who's really a sentimonster! If you go there, you might screw up the whole plan!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(suspicious)'' And you know this... how?
'''Marinette''': ''(nervously)'' Uh- Oh, well... i-it's because I-I have a really good view of the whole thing since the very beginning. You might even say I have front row seats here! ''(lays down smugly inside her bubble)''
''(Cat Noir sighs in defeat and leans on his stick.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: the Césaire residence}}
<poem>
'''Rena Rouge''': ''(as "Ladybug")'' What's going on? ''(as "Alya")'' The Bubbler has captured my family, my friends!
'''Ladybug (illusion)''': What's going on? 
'''Alya (illusion)''': The Bubbler has captured my family, my friends!
'''Ladybug (illusion)''': Hmm, but not you?
'''Alya (illusion)''': I don't know. He was already gone when I got here. 
'''Ladybug (illusion)''': That's strange. It would have made more sense if he threatened your family in order to force you to betray me.
'''Alya (illusion)''': I'd never betray you, Ladybug. 
'''Ladybug (illusion)''': Shadow Moth attacked your family because he found out that you're a superhero. Unfortunately, I won't be able to give you the Miraculous of the Fox ever again. 
''("Alya" gasps.)''
''(scene changes to Shadow Moth, shocked that his plan begins to fail)''
'''Shadow Moth''': No!! This isn't the plan!
'''Sentibubbler''': ''(takes out his bubble sword)'' Shall I capture Ladybug?
'''Shadow Moth''': Wait! Just a moment!
'''Rena Rouge''': ''(as "Alya")'' I was proud to fight by your side, Ladybug. ''(as "Ladybug")'' Don't worry...
'''Ladybug (illusion)''': ...I'll find another holder and give him a different, but very powerful Miraculous! We'll save your loved ones!
'''Rena Rouge''': ''(as "Alya")'' Thank you, Ladybug!
''("Ladybug" swings away.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': I'm looking forward on getting my hands on this new and powerful Miraculous, as well! Let's follow her!

'''Cat Noir''': If the sentimonster touches the illusion, it'll disappear! He'll know it's a trap! I gotta stop him!
'''Marinette''': Great idea! 
'''Cat Noir''': ''(extends his stick and sits on it, levelling it to Marinette's bubble)'' Don't worry, the real Ladybug will get here and together we'll save you!
'''Marinette''': ''(watches Cat Noir jump away)'' We already are, Kitty Cat. We already are.
''(Sentibubbler chases after the illusion of Ladybug, who's then cut short by Cat Noir.)''
'''Cat Noir''':  So, now you're a superhero stalker, Bubbler?
''(Sentibubbler throws a bubble at Cat Noir and dodges it. He jumps toward Sentibubbler then blocks it with his bubble sword. They continue to fight over the rooftops. Shadow Moth spectates their battle.)''

''(Shadow Moth hits Cat Noir and gets caught in one of Sentibubbler's bubbles.)

'''Cat Noir''':  You'll need more than this to capture this cat! Cataclysm! ''(He uses his power to pop the bubble, but unfortunately he gets caught once again. He laughs nervously once beside Marinette.)
'''Shadow Moth and Sentibubbler''': It's over for you, Cat Noir!

'''Alya''': From this point on, Trixx, Rena Rouge can never be seen in the light of day. Shadow Moth's gotta believe that no one's using the Miraculous of the Fox!
'''Trixx''': Now that's sly. Very sly!
'''Alya''': Trixx, let's pounce! ''(she transforms once again into Rena Rouge)''

''(Scene focuses on hopeless Marinette and Cat Noir trapped inside the bubbles.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(off-camera)'' Nobody can see us from the outside now!

''(Sentibubbler silences Cat Noir's bubble.)''
'''Cat Noir''': No one will silence me, Shadow Moth! ''(becomes inaudible)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Now, I will have the pleasure of capturing Ladybug! 
'''Ladybug''': ''(inside her bubble)'' ''(softly)'' [[Lucky Charm]]! ''(She uses her power and gets a polka-dotted pot. She uses her Lucky vision and looks at the coffee cup Shadow Moth is holding, Sentibubbler, and the tarantula that is trapped inside the bubble.)'' That cup's gotta be the object that allows him to control the sentimonster!
''(Ladybug opens her yo-yo and grabs the [[Horse Miraculous]]. She wears the glasses as [[Kaalki]] emerges from it.)
'''Ladybug''': Tikki, Kaalki, [[Unification|Unify]]! ''(She transforms into Pegabug.)''

'''Sentibubbler''': Show yourself, Ladybug! It's over for you and Cat Noir! 
'''Sentibubbler and Shadow Moth''': If you don't surrender... 
'''Sentibubbler''': ...I'll send all these prisoners into space! Three, two, one! Too late!! ''(Sentibubbler brings the bubbles high up into the sky as it head toward outer space.)''
'''Ella and Etta''': Help, Ladybug!!!
'''Sentibubbler''': Hurry up! The bubbles are rising! Tick-tock, Ladybug!
''(Cat Noir's ring begins to beep.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(very worried)'' It's now or never for your awesome two-person plan, m'lady!
''(Pegabug spots Shadow Moth, the [[Peacock Miraculous|Peacock]] and the [[Butterfly Miraculous]], and his coffee cup.)''
'''Pegabug''': I won't be able to seize everything at once! First, the object that controls the sentimonster. [[Voyage]]! ''(She opens up a portal that opens up behind Shadow Moth, ambushing him and grabbing his coffee cup.)'' 
'''Shadow Moth''': Ladybug!
<center>'''''[Post-Transformation Sequence]'''''<br />'''Pegabug''': No, Pegabug! ''(strikes a pose)''</center>
''(Shadow Moth tries to catch Pegabug but she was able to jump on a lamppost whilst holding the coffee cup that controls Sentibubbler.)''
'''Pegabug''': Sentibubbler! Bring the bubbles down and free the prisoners!
'''Sentibubbler''': At your command! ''(sends down the bubbles safely to the ground)''
'''Shadow Moth''': You're forgetting something, Pegabug! ''I'' created him! Sentibubbler, I release you from existence! ''(snaps his fingers and Sentibubbler disappears)''
'''Pegabug''': No! 
''(The amok from the coffee cup appears and purifies itself as it floats in the air. The bubbles that hold Alya's family and Nino captive pops which send them falling to the ground.)''
'''Rena Rouge''': ''(inside her room)'' Reality! ''(The illusion of Marinette's bubble vanishes.)''
''(Cat Noir catches Nino and Pegabug lassoes her yo-yo to create a net to catch the Césaires safely.)''
'''Pegabug''': Kaalki, dismount! ''(Kaalki comes out from her glasses and transforms back to Ladybug. She brought down everybody back to the ground gently, including their tarantula as she traps it with her pot.)''
'''Ladybug''': Gotcha! ''(She hands it over to Otis.)'' Can you hold on to this for me, please?
''(Otis grabs the pot with the tarantula on it.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(to Cat Noir)'' Where did Shadow Moth go? 
''(Both look up on the roof, seeing Shadow Moth escape.)''
'''Cat Noir''': I think he felt the wind start to change.
'''Ladybug''': This could've been the end of Shadow Moth. ''(looks down)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(his ring starts to beep again)'' You know, I really thought today was the end of Cat Noir. But you guys really had it under control. 
''(Ladybug smiles.)''
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir''': Pound it!
''(Cat Noir jumps away. Ladybug approaches the Césaires.)''
'''Ladybug''': I guess you'll need a little something. I'll come back in a minute.

'''Ladybug''': ''(hugs Rena Rouge)'' You rocked, Rena Rouge!
'''Rena Rouge''': See? When someone trusts me with a "thing," I don't lose it.
'''Ladybug''': ''(takes the terrarium from Rena Rouge)'' I never should've second-guessed letting you hold on to the Miraculous. ''(swings back to where the Césaires are)''

'''Alya''': Pretty sly, don't you think?
'''Marinette''': Sly as a fox! You're a true superhero!
