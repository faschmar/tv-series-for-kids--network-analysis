<poem>
'''Everyone''': Pound it!
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]]''': Way to go, guys! You're the best super team ever. [[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]] didn't stand a chance.
'''[[Nino Lahiffe|Carapace]]''': That's why he stays in the shadows, cause we shine too bright for him!
'''[[Lê Chiến Kim|King Monkey]]''': ''(laughs)'' Good one Carapace!
''(Carapace and King Monkey high-five each other. Their Miraculous start beeping.)''
'''Ladybug''': Well, he won't stay in the shadows long if we all de-transform right here. Let's rendezvous later so you can all return your Miraculous to me.
'''Cat Noir''': Can I come with you?
''(Ladybug frowns.)''
'''Cat Noir''': I know, I know. Only the Guardian knows the identities of the Miraculous holders. And Cat Noir, despite being the first and most amazing team member of all is now just a holder like any other.
'''Ladybug''': Yeah, but you'll always be my favorite! ''(kisses Cat Noir by the cheek)'' Mwah! Byeeee!
''(Ladybug swings out. Cat Noir smirks.)''
'''Ladybug''': Rena Furtive!
''(Rena Furtive checks each rendezvous point.)''
'''Rena Furtive''': You can go now, the coast is clear.
''(Ladybug retrieves the Miraculous from others.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(waves to Nino after her earrings ring)'' Bug out!
''(Ladybug meets up with Rena Furtive in an alley)''
'''Rena Furtive''': Another perfectly organized operation, Mademoiselle Ladybug! Let's rest. ''(de-transforms into Alya)''
'''Ladybug''': And perfectly secure thanks to you, Mademoiselle Rena Furtive! Spots off. ''(de-transforms into Marinette)''
'''Alya''': We're so good at this that we'll even be on time to see "[[United Heroez]]: The Final End Fight" at the movies!
'''Marinette''': Are you saying for once we'll actually see the beginning of a movie?
'''Alya''': Yeah, if we run! ''(both laugh)''

{{Scene|Scene: Interior, the [[Agreste mansion]], in the [[The Crypt|repository]]. Gabriel stands in front of [[Emilie Agreste|Emilie]]'s cryogenic pod.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': I have failed again, Emilie. We should have been reunited long ago. I tried everything to get my hands on the Miraculous of Ladybug and Cat Noir. I should have already combined their powers that would have granted me the wish to bring you back! ''(starts sobbing)'' I am not... worthy... of our love!
''(Gabriel pounds his fist on Emilie's cryogenic pod, cracking the glass. Horrified, he places his hand, securing the pod, and runs to the elevator.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, the [[Agreste mansion]], [[Nathalie's room]].}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': ''(slams fist)'' Ladybug never makes a mistake!
'''[[Nathalie]]''': Neither do you. Ladybug hasn't discovered who you are, she hasn't seized [[Butterfly Miraculous|your]] [[Peacock Miraculous|Miraculous]] and— ''(coughs)''
'''Gabriel''': Nathalie! You see, I've made at least one mistake.
'''Nathalie''': It wasn't a mistake. I was the one who decided to use the Peacock Miraculous despite it being damaged. I was fully aware of the risk that I was taking.
'''Gabriel''': A risk... Of course! She never makes mistakes, because she never takes any risks! ''(laughs maniacally)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Hawk Moth's lair.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': I need a villain who will force Ladybug to take risks, and without even realizing it, ''(corrupts a butterfly into an akuma)'' she'll make a mistake!
'''<span title="Disney Plus sources it as Adrien. VA sounds different, though" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Adrien</span>''': Great, of course my keys disappear from my bag just when I have to go out.
'''[[Xavier Ramier|Xavier]]''': Now even benches have empty pigeon spikes on them? Oh, my poor friends...
'''Froggy's Dad''': [[Froggy]], come back! It's too dangerous!
'''Froggy''': Why are you always scared of everything? I want to ride my bike without a helmet, without training wheels!
'''Shadow Moth''': Perfect! Fly away, my mega-kuma, and plague that deceived heart!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes|<span id="Burrow">Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes</span>]]}}
<poem>
'''Froggy's Dad''': Come back!
'''Froggy's Mom''': Froggy, come back! It's time to go home!
''(The akuma infects Froggy's stuffed toy)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Risk. I am Shadow Moth. I'm giving you the power to make people forget all about their fears. Thanks to you, they will take all the risks, and let you take all the risks that you want also!
'''Froggy''': Oh, will it work on my parents too?
'''Shadow Moth''': Yes. All the daddies, mommies, and children who hear your song will start taking risks without even realizing it. Do we have a deal?
'''Froggy''': Yeah! ''(transforms into Risk)'' 
'''Risk''': Woah!
'''Froggy's Dad''': ''(panting; angrily)'' Where's your helmet? And your training wheels?
''(Risk releases an energy particles from his bike horn, marking both of them)''
'''Risk''': I'm Froggy, here I come, I'm not afraid of anyone.
''(The parents wave at Froggy while he's riding his bike)''
'''Froggy's Dad''': Go ahead. After all, riding a bicycle's not that risky.
'''Risk''': I'm Froggy, here I come.
'''Shadow Moth''': You and I are going to have a lot of fun Risk, but you have to be discrete! Hide your Froggy toy wheel, otherwise, Ladybug will come and break it and you'll lose all your powers.
'''Risk''': I'm gonna hide it where she'll never find it.
''(Later in the streets)''
'''Risk''': I'm Froggy, here I come, I'm not afraid of anyone.
''(A montage shows everyone, including Marinette and Adrien, getting marked by Risk's power)''
'''Shadow Moth (v.o.)''':Ladybug, Cat Noir, whoever you are, wherever you're hiding, you are now bearing the mark of Risk. Of course I have no idea what mistake you're going to make or how you'll make it, but I do know that the beating of my wings has sown the seeds of recklessness, and now I just have to wait, then harvest your downfall.

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Adrien wakes up and yawns. His computer rings from Nathalie's video call.}}
<poem>
'''Nathalie''': Adrien, remember that you have—
'''Adrien''': School at 8:30, fencing at 1:30, then piano practice and Chinese class. But first and foremost, the breakfast for two that my father has been promising me for months.
'''Nathalie''': Umm, about that.
'''Adrien''': What? Awww. He's cancelled, hasn't he?
'''Nathalie''': No, no! You ''will'' meet with him... but, for a work session. 
''(A robot comes in.)''
'''Nathalie''': Last night, your father had an idea for a new ad campaign. Please put on these clothes before joining him in his study.
'''Plagg''': Well I for one would love to have breakfast with you.
'''Risk''': I'm Froggy, here I come, I'm not afraid of anyone.
'''Adrien''': I've had it, Plagg! I'm tired of photos and ads! I don't wanna be a model for [[Gabriel|my father's brand]] anymore! I just wanna be a son, and be able to have breakfast with him just once! I'm gonna go talk to him.
'''Plagg''': ''(shocked by Adrien's rash outburst, he flies over to Adrien)'' You do realize that your father will take this very badly, right?
'''Adrien''': I'm willing to take that risk! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Gabriel's atelier. [[Lila Rossi]], [[Bob Roth]], and [[Vincent]] are present.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': ''(angrily)'' Father, I need to talk to you!
'''Gabriel''': ''(angrily)'' Now's not the time, Adrien! Go change into the clothes you're supposed to be wearing!
'''Adrien''': Yes, Father.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Stairs. Adrien walks back sadly}}
<poem>
'''Plagg''': Come on, don't give up! Rebellions are like cheese soufflés, just because they collapse doesn't mean you shouldn't try again!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Gabriel's atelier}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': ''(off-camera)'' A girl. A boy. They search for each other all over the world, before finally meeting in Paris, at the top of the Eiffel Tower.
'''Lila''': This is even more romantic than the Hollywood film I starred in!
'''Adrien''': Lila, we both know that's not true. I may have to work with you but I don't have to listen to your lies. ''(Lila looks at him angrily)''
'''Bob''': Gabriel, all these scenery's gonna cost us a pretty penny and green screens and pasteboard backdrops!
'''Gabriel''': There will be no pasteboard backdrops, Bob. I want sincerity! I want truth! This shoot will last several months all over the world. Adrien and Lila are leaving this afternoon.
''(Lila looks thrilled, but Adrien protests.)''
'''Adrien''': What? I can't leave Paris!
'''Gabriel''': Is there a problem, Adrien?
'''Lila''': You're afraid of being away from your friends at school! But when I risk travelling around the world, I always stayed in touch with you all, and it only made us closer. ''(hugs Adrien)''
'''Gabriel''': So there's no problem. At the end of the ad, using CG, they will melt together to become the perfume bottle. Two souls, one mind, one heart. First Love, the fragrance.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. Marinette watches Nadja's broadcast in shock and horror}}
<poem>
'''Nadja''': Gabriel Agreste took the world by storm this morning as he presented his new ad campaign, an ambitious project that will be filmed all over the world as an homage to the universal truth of first love.
'''Marinette''': ''(disgusted)'' Lila... representing... truth? Away with Adrien for weeks? ''It's the end of the world!''
'''[[Tikki]]''': Marinette, you've watched this 22 times already! You really need to get to school.
'''Marinette''': Ah! School! ''(picks her bag and runs to the door)'' Today's Adrien's last day at school and I'm running late! ''(screams)'' ''(a few moments later)'' Ah! And I'm still in my pajamas! ''(comes back to her room; Tikki chuckles and nods)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Collège Françoise Dupont, Courtyard}}
<poem>
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': Come on! Places, everyone! Latecomers will ''parlez'' with the principal later.
'''Lila''': I really didn't expect Gabriel Agreste to choose me to travel the world with Adrien. ''(chuckles)'' It's true that I do speak almost every language in the world, but I think above all that it was my sincerity that touched his heart. ''(Marinette, behind the trash can, watching from afar, dry retches in annoyance)''
'''Nino''': An around the world trip, buddy! You got the best excuse for missing my birthday.
'''Rose''': Right over here! Good to see ya.
'''Tikki''': Hurry, Marinette! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Collège Françoise Dupont, Locker room}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Adrien doesn't look happy, and I feel like I'm the only one who sees it!
'''Tikki''': You can see it cause you love him, Marinette!
'''Marinette''': I've got to tell him before he leaves. '(sighs)'' But I'm just gonna mess it all up as usual!
'''Risk''': I'm Froggy, here I come, I'm not afraid of anyone.
'''Marinette''': ''(the mark on the back of her neck glows)'' If I don't take a risk now, I'll never have the chance again!
'''Tikki''': Well said, Marinette!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Collège Françoise Dupont, Courtyard}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(slams the door open)'' Adrien!
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': Ah! Miss Dupain-Cheng! Since you finally decided to honor us with your presence, place yourself next to Adrien. You replace Lila, ''(Lila gasps)'' who just explained to us that she suffers from ballophobia.
'''Lila''': No, wait! I'm actually feeling a lot better now.
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': ''(pulls her back and pushes her to sit down)'' Oh, no no! I shall take no risks with my students' phobias.
''(Marinette smirks, walks over to Adrien, and Lila starts to growl angrily)''
'''Marinette''': Adrien! I— ''(Adrien gets hit in the face with a ball)''
'''Nino''': Yeah! Got you, buddy!
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': Adrien, to the dungeon!
'''Adrien''': To the dungeon?
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': The dungeon is located behind the opposing team. Your teammates will have to tag you to get you out.
'''Adrien''': Ah, okay.
''(Marinette is distracted. Alya uses the moment to hit Marinette with a ball)''
'''Alya''': Marinette! To the dungeon.
''(Marinette chuckles and walks next to Adrien)''
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': Need I remind you that the object of this match is to ''avoid'' the ball?
'''Marinette''': Are you really leaving for several months?
'''Adrien''': That's what my father's decided.
''(A risk takes effect.)''
'''Adrien''': If only you knew how sick I am of all of it, the photos, the film shoots, all these people fawning over me who don't even know me! These ads that don't make any sense? And now I'm expected to just leave my friends and travel to the end of the world for I don't know how long, with Lila?
''(Marinette is shocked, as Adrien had never vented his feelings before)''
'''Marinette''': Why don't you tell them all that you don't wanna do this?
'''Adrien''': No one would understand my complaining. They all think it's amazing what's happening to me.
'''Marinette''': I understand you.
'''Adrien''': ''(smiles)'' Well, you're the only one.
''(Adrien holds Marinette's hand, making her flustered. Lila, pushed to the edge, stands up and growls angrily)''
'''Marinette''': You've gotta talk to your father, Adrien.
''(Adrien lets go of her hand)''
'''Adrien''': I've tried but I can't. I don't know why. He's my father, though, I love him! I know he loves me! It's all so... frustrating! Has there ever been something you wanted to tell someone but you just couldn't do it, as if some kind of invisible force was holding you back?
'''Marinette''': All the time.
''(Marinette scratches her neck and she decides to confess to him)''
'''Marinette''': Adrien, I—
''(Lila appears between them, to their surprise)''
'''Lila''': Sir! Since class is almost over, do you think we could finish early so Adrien and I can have time to say goodbye to all of our friends?
'''Ivan''': Good idea!
'''???''': Yeah!
'''Nino''': You better send me some local music from your trip!
'''Kim''': The photos of all the beaches where you swim!
'''Rose''': And of the pretty sunsets!
'''Mr. D'Argencourt''': You so richly deserve to finally see the beauty of this world!
'''Adrien''': You're right, I am lucky, and I'm gonna miss you all so much. 
''(He smiles at everyone, particularly Marinette, who smiles back)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outside}}
<poem>
'''Lila''': We're not leaving alone, friends, we're bringing every single one of you with us in our hearts.
'''Everyone except Marinette''': Aww!
'''Marinette''': Adrien, wait up! Adrien!
''(Lila and Chloé look at each other and nod)''
'''Chloé''': ''(pushes Marinette, who is approached by Alya)'' Out of the way! Forget about these losers, Adrikins! I'll be able to come and see you whenever I want on mom's private jet.
'''Adrien''': Sure, Chloe, sure. Is everything okay?
'''Lila''': See you in a bit for our great journey, Adrien. ''(laugh)'' Bye! Love ya!
'''Chloé''': Love ya, Adrikins! Mwah! ''(smirks at Marinette, who pouts at her)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Canteen}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': We have three hours left to stop Adrien from getting on that train! Here's the plan. The potato is Adrien; Alya, you'll be the juice box, Rose the little strawberry, Nino the fork—
'''Nino''': Hang on! You wanna ''stop Adrien from travelling around the world?'' Adrien who's ''never allowed outside his house?'' Adrien who's ''never seen anything his whole life?''
'''Alya''': It's cause Lila's going with him, isn't it?
'''Rose''': If you love him, you gotta let him go and live ''his dream!''
'''Marinette''': But it's ''not'' his dream! Adrien ''hates'' the filmshoots! The photos, he can't stand it anymore! I'm not trying to save him from Lila, but from his father! He doesn't know how to tell him that he doesn't want to be a model anymore!
'''Kim''': Everybody wants to be a model.
'''Nino''': If he didn't want to model anymore, he would've told me. He's my best bud.
'''Marinette''': ''(slams table)'' But he told me himself!
''(Alya puts up a hand to stop her)''
'''Alya''': Marinette. You ''can't decide'' what Adrien does with his life, Lila or no Lila.
'''Marinette''': But—
'''Alya''': As your BFF, I refuse to follow along with this plan, for your own good as well as his. You cannot risk messing with someone else's life.
''(Marinette is about to give in, but the risk takes over her)''
'''Marinette''': Fine! I'll save him without you. ''(storms off, leaving the others shocked)''
''(Outside)''
'''Risk''': I'm Froggy, here I come, I'm not afraid of anyone.
'''Firetruck Driver''': Ah, driving without a helmet is so liberating.
'''Kim''': I'm gonna swim the entire Seine!
'''Max''': I'm coming with you!
'''Kim''': But you don't know how to swim.
'''Max''': That's why I brought my ducky! 
''(Kim and Max launch themselves into the Seine; Marinette storms towards the screen angrily as the screen changes to black)''

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien’s room. Adrien goes to pack his things sadly but to his surprise, he sees Félix sitting on top of his luggage}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': ''(gasps in shock and surprise)'' Félix?
'''Félix''': Hi there, my favorite cousin.
'''Adrien''': How did you get in?
'''Félix''': ''(mockingly)'' Oh, Nathalie! There was a problem with the car so I walked home but I forgot my keys!
'''Adrien''': ''(angrily)'' That's not how I talk!
'''Félix''': ''(rudely)'' You're right, you sound even more pathetic.
''(Félix throws him a basketball and Adrien dodges it.)''
'''Adrien''': ''(coldly)'' Why are you here this time? To mock me or ruin my reputation with my friends?
'''Félix''': ''(smiling)'' Neither. I'm here to save you.
'''Adrien''': ''(bluntly)'' I'm doing just fine, thank you.
'''Félix''': ''(sarcastically)'' Oh yeah, I can see how happy you look. ''(he reveals his phone which shows Nadja's broadcast that morning, and zooms into Adrien, who looks sad)'' You don't expect me to believe that leaving Paris and your super cool, super nice friends behind is really what you want, do you?
'''Adrien''': ''(furiously throws his clothes)'' I don't know what I want.
'''Félix''': I know, and that's why the second I saw your face on TV this morning, I left London to get you out of this mess. Freedom is something you make Adrien. For starters, you gotta stop doing everything your father tells you to.
'''Adrien''': I can't disobey him.
'''Félix''': ''(rebelliously)'' You can't, but I can. Remember how we pretended to be each other when we were little? We're gonna do the same thing. Because unlike you, I can say no to your father.
'''Adrien''': I know my father. He'll never give in.
'''Félix''': Or maybe your fear keeps you from seeing a hidden side of him. If I succeed, you get to go back to your school and your super nice friends tomorrow. So? Do you want to take that risk and try it?
'''Adrien''': You're right! But what am I gonna do in the meantime?
'''Félix''': For once, whatever you want. You only have one life, Adrien.

<poem>
'''Félix''':  Excuse me! Can you give me a hand with my suitcases?
''([[Adrien's bodyguard]] walks inside the mansion together with him. Meanwhile, Adrien as 'Félix' sneaks outside to escape the mansion. While the bodyguard is busy, Félix wastes no time to cut to the chase, towards Gabriel's room, running by Nathalie's room on the way, where she's struggling with packing up her suitcase. Félix helps her out.)''
'''Félix''': Hang on, Nathalie! Let me help you.
'''Nathalie''': Thank you, Adrien.
''(Félix takes Nathalie's tablet from the suitcase before closing it.)''
'''Félix''': All done!
'''Nathalie''': Thank you!
''(Félix comes face to face with Gabriel himself.)''
'''Félix''': Ah!
'''Gabriel''': I have one last thing to tell Nathalie, then it's time to go. Wait outside.
'''Félix''': Yes, father.
''(Félix walks for a bit towards the entrance door, only for him to go back and straight to Gabriel's room.)''
'''Félix''': I KNOW you've got a secret, uncle.
''(Félix takes out his heat-seeking spy monocole.)''
'''Félix''': ''Nothing'' will stop me from finding out what you're hiding this time!
''(Félix scans closer to Emilie's painting, and puts a mechanism to see the code and unlock the secret compartment. He then proceeds to temporarily disable the camera to take what he's looking for... the miraculous.)''
'''Félix''': I knew it... Shadow Moth!
''(Félix puts the 2 items in the bag. He then reactivates the camera, and locks the secret compartment again. He's intrigued when he finds yet another hidden switch on the same painting, and proceeds to touch the painting hoping to find yet another secret... he's whisked away to the repository.)''
'''Gabriel''': This is our riskiest plan yet! There are so many parameters we have no control over.

'''Félix''': I... I wanted to tell you father that... ''(takes a deep breath)'' I don't wanna go on this trip!

'''Marinette''': ''(excitedly)'' Of course! Gabriel Agreste is a dragon, Adrien is prince imprisoned by the dragon. And to save a prince from a dragon, you need A KNIGHT!
'''Tikki''': And that knight is you?
'''Marinette''': Of course not, Tikki! The knight is... Ladybug! No one listens to Marinette, but everyone listens to Ladybug. As Ladybug, I will be able to convince the dragon Gabriel Agreste, and Prince Adrien will be saved. Tadaaa!
'''Tikki''': Marinette, you've been taking too many risks today, something's wrong! Remember, Adrien is your weakness, and everytime you've used Ladybug's powers to solve your personal problems—
''(Marinette gets affected by the risk mark again.)''

'''Adrien''': No! Félix is gonna call me any second.
''(Kagami calls Adrien over the phone.)''
'''Adrien''': Kagami?
'''Kagami''': ''(angrily)'' Adrien, I saw you on TV this morning, and I know that you ''don't'' want to leave. Once again, you let your ''father'' decide for you! ''(harshly)'' How long are you going to remain ''his puppet'', Adrien?
'''Adrien''': ''(shocked)'' But... my cousin is gonna talk to him, and-
'''Kagami''': ''(annoyed)'' This just keeps getting better. You're letting your COUSIN do things for you now? Who's pulling the strings of your life? Your cousin? Your father? Me, when we were together? It's never YOU! You're only good at doing what people tell you to do! Dare to cut your strings, Adrien! ''(stops and contemplates for a moment, then genuinely apologizes for her harsh manner)'' ...Forgive me if I hurt you. ''(hangs up sadly)''
'''Plagg''': ''(shocked)'' Wow, that girl is more character than any cheese I've ever tasted!
''(The risk mark activates, and Adrien scratches his neck.)''
'''Adrien''': ''(determined)'' Kagami's right! I should have stood up to my father from the very beginning! Félix shouldn't be doing this for me, I need to take my own rightful place, and tell my father what I have to tell him MYSELF! ''(types out the message)'' Félix, stop everything. I'm on my way!

''(The other bystanders look in confusion.)''
'''Ladybug''': Ah! What I mean is uh... Paris needs you! Cause you know, Paris without Adrien Agreste is kinda like, Paris without the Eiffel Tower! I saw that in the news all that you're leaving. They're all at risk of being akumatised! Talk to your father and tell him that you can't go away for such a long time!
'''Félix''': I already talked to him, Ladybug, but he wouldn't listen.
'''Ladybug''': You HAVE to ''insist!'' Stand up to him, you have to trust yourself and not to take that risk!
'''Félix''': I don't have the courage. Unlike you, I'm ''not'' a superhero.
