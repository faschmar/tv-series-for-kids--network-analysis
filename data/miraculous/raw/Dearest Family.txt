{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair]], [[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel]] is holding onto a [[Magical Charms|magical charm]]. He holds out his tablet while an akuma flutters around his lair, testing if he would be akumatized.}}
<poem>
'''Gabriel''': Come here, my little akuma, and evilize me!
''(The akuma flies toward his tablet, only to be blocked by a powerful force created by the magical charm. The akuma then becomes purified as it touched the force field.)''
'''Gabriel''': ''(opens his tablet)'' The magical charm keeps repelling the akuma.
'''[[Nathalie Sancoeur|Nathalie]]''': ''(from the tablet, coughing)'' If Ladybug was able to create a magical charm to counter the akumas, then your power is capable of evolving, too.

'''Nathalie''': The Grimoire is clear: the only limits to the powers of the Miraculous are those their holders set for them.

<poem>
'''Gabriel''': [[Duusu]], [[Nooroo]], dual metamorphosis! ''(transforms into Shadow Moth)''
''(Shadow Moth places his tablet on the table with Nathalie still on the call. He takes a deep breath as a butterfly lands on his palm and concentrates on his power to create a much powerful akuma. Successfully corrupting a butterfly, it flutters from his hand.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Reverse morphosis! ''(de-transforms into Gabriel)''
''(He grabs hold of the tablet again as he summons the akuma to himself.)''
'''Gabriel''': Akumatize me! ''(For the second time, the akuma flies towards his tablet, but to no avail, as the akuma is repelled and purified once again.)'' It's no use, Nathalie!
'''Nathalie''': ''(from the tablet)'' Don't give up! Force the power to your will. Don't forget why you're doing this, Gabriel!
'''Gabriel''': Duusu, Nooroo, dual metamorphosis! ''(transforms again into Shadow Moth)''
''(A butterfly lands on his hand, tries to corrupt it with more evil force as a purple aura envelops him, leaving Nathalie in awe inside Gabriel's tablet.)
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(continues to corrupt the akuma)'' I... can do this! I want ''it''! ''(grunts)''
''(Successfully creating a more powerful akuma in his hand, purple lightning streaks began to form around it as it flutters away from his palm.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Reverse morphosis! 
''(He de-transforms again into Gabriel)''
'''Gabriel''': Come, megakuma. Evilize me!
''(The megakuma flies towards his tablet, persisting through the force of the magical charm until the megakuma destroys it, and finally landing on Gabriel's tablet, who then transforms into the Collector.)''
'''The Collector''': Finally!!
'''Nathalie''': ''(from the tablet)'' You did it!
''(Gabriel, as the Collector, releases the megakuma from himself and de-transforms.)
'''Gabriel''': I can't wait to see what you'll make of this, Ladybug.

{{Scene|Scene: Interior, [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie]]. A timer ticks for five seconds and rings.}}
<poem>
'''[[Rolland Dupain|Rolland]]''': ''(blocks Tom's hand from opening the oven)'' Not with a dish cloth, son! That's not how it's done! ''(wears oven mitts)''
''(As Rolland opens the oven, a sweet, enticing scent of the galette escapes the oven and Rolland, Tom, and Sabine look at in awe. Tom places the galette on the table and grabs a piece from it, as well as Sabine and Rolland, their eyes widening in satisfaction.)''
'''Rolland''': It melts in the mouth!
'''[[Tom Dupain|Tom]]''': And yet perfectly crispy!
'''[[Sabine Cheng|Sabine]]''': It's delicious! Congratulations! It's the first recipe you've made together: your own father-and-son King's Day galette!
'''Rolland''': The perfect alliance of tradition...
'''Tom''': And modernity! 
''(Tom and Rolland come in for a hug. Sabine opens the bakery.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. [[Tikki]] is found sleeping as the delicious aroma of the galette from downstairs wakes her.}}
<poem>
'''Tikki''': ''(panics)'' Marinette! Marinette, what's that smell?
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]''': ''(half-asleep, voice hoarse)'' It's a galette. Made for King's Day. Every year, same day, same time, whoever finds the charm in their slice gets a to wear a golden paper crown. ''(yawns)'' Go back to sleep, Tikki. It's too early for a Sunday. ''(covers herself with her blanket)''
'''Tikki''': But I've never smelled anything so sweet and wonderful! May I please go and try a little bit?
'''Marinette''': No, Tikki! No one can see you! 
''(The other kwamis start to wake up and come out from different places in Marinette's room)''
'''[[Wayzz]]''': ''(from one of the drawers)'' What's going on?
'''[[Stompp]]''': Is it breakfast time yet?
'''[[Barkk]]''': Ooohh, I'm hungry! I'm so hungry!
'''Marinette''': ''(sits up on her loft bed)'' Oh, okay. I get it...
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Interior, [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie]]. Tom brings out another fresh galette out the oven. Rolland helps him cook two more, putting the raw galettes on the pan as Tom brings the tray back in the oven. Sabine organizes the galettes and puts them in boxes.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': ''(sleepy)'' Good morning.
'''Rolland''': Oh, it's my baby sweetiepie!
'''Tom''': Did my little girl have a good night sleep?
'''Marinette''': ''(yawns)'' Can I please have a tiny piece of galette?
'''Tom''': Marinette has ''always'' loved galettes! ''(grabs a bread knife to slice the galette before Rolland snatches it away from him)''
'''Rolland''': That's not how it's done! The tradition is that first, we sell all the galettes we made, ''(hands over the tray of galette to Sabine)'' and then we get to enjoy the very last galette together as a family! Until then, ''(slides the galette in a box)'' all the galettes are for the customers.
''(Tikki, inside Marinette's purse, inhales the sweet smell of the galette. Marinette and Tom share a hearty chuckle as Tom hands her a tray of croissants.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(grabs a piece of croissant)'' Thanks, Dad! ''(walks to the stairs, closing the door behind her)''
'''Tikki''': Where's the galette thing-y that's giving off that enchanting smell?
'''Marinette''': We have to wait until tonight for the galette, Tikki. But you can have some of this croissant while you wait!
'''Tikki''': ''(flies in front of Marinette, blocking and surprising her)'' I can't wait that long, Marinette! The smell is ''soooo'' extraordinary! I have to taste whatever it is, please, please, ''please?''
'''Marinette''': ''(chuckles)'' Alright. I'll go try and get you a piece. I do want to try Dad and Grandpa's new galette! Hide, Tikki!
''(Tikki zooms in her purse as the both of them head back downstairs.)''
'''Marinette''': Um... I was just thinking, maybe I could help you by handing out little samples of the galette to the customers standing in the line outside! It'll help them stay patient!
'''Rolland''': Great idea!
''(Marinette grabs a tray of sliced galettes on the table and shoves a few pieces inside her purse for Tikki to munch on.)
'''Rolland''': It's nice to see that young people still have a sense of service.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Exterior, [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie]]. Marinette distributes the pieces to the customers lined in front of their bakery.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]]! [[Chris Lahiffe|Chris]]! Happy King's Galette Day! ''(The Lahiffe brothers grab a one piece each from the tray.)'' A quartet of queens for the King's Galette! ''([[Alya Césaire|Alya]], [[Nora Césaire|Nora]], [[Ella and Etta Césaire|Ella and Etta]] grab pieces of galette from Marinette as well.)'' Enjoy, girls!
''(She went on with other customers to let them have a taste of the galette made by her family as all of them are put in a trance in savoring the delicious little slices of galette.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. Marinette comes back with the slices of galette for the other kwamis.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Here you go! I brought you all some of that delicious ga— ''(gasps as she found a lethargic Tikki who finished all the slices of galette she shoved inside her purse)'' Uhh... I... must've... dropped the pieces! Sorry! ''(scratches the back of her head)''
''(But the kwamis are not convinced enough as they collectively gasp in fear.)''
'''[[Sass]]''': That's not what happened!
'''[[Daizzi]]''': Tikki ate them all up!
'''Tikki''': ''(furious)'' Me? You're accusing ''me''??
''(The kwamis huddle together, terrified)''
'''The rest of the Kwamis''': Oh, that's right!
'''Marinette''': ''(titters)'' You guys are joking! Tikki would never do such a thing!
'''Sass''': Marinette, you know how much Tikki loves to eat, but do you really understand the Kwami of Creation's appetite for food?
'''Stompp''': It's a gourmet craving of cosmic dimensions!
'''Sass''': The pastry your father and his father created together is exceptional, unique. I'm afraid its impact on Tikki will—
'''Marinette''': You're exaggerating, Sass. It's just a galette.
'''Sass''': I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I think you don't know Tikki as well as you think you do.
''(Tikki glares at the kwamis angrily.)''
'''Marinette''': What?! Of course, I know her! I can say that I know her better than anyone! 
'''Tikki''': Don't listen to them, Marinette! He's not worth getting upset about when it's so much easier just to go back and get some galette for '''''everybody!'''''
''(The kwamis gasp in fear and huddle again.)''
'''Marinette''': You're absolutely right, Tikki! So, everyone just stay here like good kwamis and Tikki and I will be back soon with some galette for everyone! Okay?
''(The kwamis, still huddled together, nod together in agreement. Hearing the trapdoor closing, they disperse inside the room in panic.)''
'''[[Ziggy]]''': We're never gonna  get to taste that sublime galette!
'''Barkk''': And we'll be lucky if that's the only consequence of the Great Sweet Tooth's appetite!
'''Sass''': Barkk, Wayzz, since this is an emergency, I'm giving you permission to go out. 
''(Barkk and Wayzz nod to each other and fly outside.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|Dupain-Cheng Residence]], stairs. Marinette goes to the bakery downstairs with Tikki to grab some galette.}}
<poem>
'''Tikki''': I'm sorry. The distribution took so long and the galette samples smelled so good. ''(whimpers)''
'''Marinette''': Don't worry, there'll be enough for everybody! There's no need to react like they did. ''(opens the door to the bakery)'' 
'''[[André Bourgeois|André]]''': ''(tugging a galette box from Rolland)'' I promise to erect a statue in your honor in front of City Hall in exchange for your last galette!
'''Rolland''': That's not how it's done! The Dupain-Chengs eat the last galette ''(hits André with a baguette continuously)'' together as a family! ''(snatches the box of galette and pushes André out of the bakery)'' Get out of here! Away, you felon! ''(closes the bakery door)'' Ahh, so, shall we enjoy this last galette?
''(A cheerful sound of a motor horn was heard just outside the bakery. The motorcycle parks in front the bakery with [[Gina Dupain|Gina]] on board. She then takes off her helmet.)
'''[[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]''': ''(background)'' Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous! Are you kidding me??
'''Rolland''': ''(panics, brings down the box of galette and fixes his hair)'' Gina?
'''Tom''': Mom?
''(Rolland, Tom and Sabine open the door. Marinette goes to join them as well before Tikki stops her.)''
'''Tikki''': Um, Marinette, what are you going to do with that... that galette? ''(points at the galette on the shelf)''
'''Marinette''': Don't worry, Tikki. I'll put aside a piece for you and the others. ''(runs towards the bakery exit)''
'''Gina''': Happy birthday, Marinetta! ''(leans on her motorcycle gift wrapped with a big red ribbon)''
'''Tom''': Mom, Marinette's last birthday was only a few months ago and you were there.
'''Gina''': Oh, this year has gone by a little fast.
'''Rolland''': How can anyone have their head so far up in the clouds?! A birthday's a birthday! A Galette's Day is a Galette's Day!
'''Gina''': Who cares? A party is a party! We put candles on the galette and Marinetta will get the present earlier, that's all. ''(to Marinette)'' Happy birthday, sweetheart! It's a beauty, isn't it? ''(Rolland, Tom and Sabine groan)'' Eighteen hundred cubic centimeters, 2V cylinders, zero to three hundred kilometers per hour in five seconds flat!
'''Rolland''': Gina! We're talking about a fourteen-year-old girl!
'''Tom''': There's no way she's going to ride that... thing!
'''Gina''': And why not?
'''Wayzz''': Psst!
'''Wayzz and Barkk''': Marinette.
''(Marinette looks over Wayzz and Barkk peeking behind a lamppost, Wayzz pointing at Tikki who is about to get her hands on the box of galette inside the bakery.)''
'''Gina''': Nothing is too good for my little fairy?
'''Marinette''': ''(runs inside the bakery and snatches the box of galette from Tikki)'' Tikki! What are you doing?
'''Tikki''': I was just trying to... g-get a... sniff of this fabulous galette! Ah! ''(zooms into Marinette's purse)''
''(Marinette's family enters the bakery, which sends Marinette to fumble over the box of galette she was holding.)''
'''Marinette''': Ahh! Oh, there you are! ''(manages to catch the box, nervous)'' I was... just about to bring this galette to the living room! So we can eat it... as a family! Right?
''(Gina, Rolland, Tom and Sabine stare blankly at her.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|Dupain-Cheng Residence]], living room. Gina, Rolland, Tom and Sabine sit together on the sofa.}}
<poem>
''(While Gina is speaking, Marinette distributes plates to the four of them, putting the plates on the coffee table.)''
'''Gina''': You may not want to see it but Marinetta is no longer a little ragazza!  She's a young lady and she's going to love her Nonna—
'''Rolland''': Nonsense! Marinette will be an adult when she's twenty-one! Until then, she's a child. Allowing her to think otherwise is crazy enough— 
'''Marinette''': I don't think I—
'''Tom''': You guys didn't come here to argue again?! I know my little girl better than anyone, and I think that huge bike is way too dangerous for her!
'''Marinette''': Hey, I'm—
'''Rolland''': You're right, son. Your mother is ''irresponsible and dangerous!''
'''Tom''': That's not what I said!
'''Gina''': ''(to Rolland)'' And what do you know about Marinette, Mr. Grumpy?
'''Wayzz''': Psst!
''(Marinette gasps, seeing Barkk and Wayzz hiding behind a lamp to let her know that Tikki is flying towards the galette on the dining table. Tikki was about to take a bite before Marinette slides on the table and the galette slips from her hands, unable to grab Tikki as well. The galette lands on her hands safely with her family finally noticing her strange behavior.)''
'''Sabine''': What exactly are you doing, Marinette?
'''Marinette''': Nothing! ''(titters)'' Don't you think it's time we ate Dad and Grandpa's delicious galette? ''(sees a hungry Tikki by the corner of the ceiling, about to dive into the plate of galette she is holding)'' Okay, everybody! Here you go! ''(places the galette on the coffee table and distributes the plates on their hands)'' Come on! Yummy-yummy! Mmm, it's so good! 
''(Marinette turns back to see the corner of the ceiling where Tikki was last seen but is now nowhere to be found. She shifts her head around the room anxiously to find her kwami, placing the galette back to the dining table and hides behind a stool.)''
'''Gina''': Tom is overprotective of his daughter anyway. Just like his father was with hi—
'''Rolland''': That's how it's done! Parents protect their children!
'''Tom''': I don't overprotect my little girl!
'''Sabine''': Yes, you do, Tom! She's not a little girl anymore, you know?
''(Marinette, in the background, continues to catch Tikki. She climbs up the stairs.)''
'''Gina''': Agreed! Which means she can ride the bike.
'''Sabine''': That's not what I said!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. Marinette quickly closes the trapdoor in panic.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Tikki is not acting normal!
'''Sass''': It's not as if we didn't try to warn you.
'''[[Xuppu]]''': When the Great Sweet Tooth has the munchies...
'''Ziggy''': She becomes out of control!
'''Marinette''': There is still one way to take control of this situation. Tikki, spots on! 
''(Tikki, from downstairs, gets summoned in Marinette's earrings as Marinette transforms into Ladybug.)''
'''Ladybug''': ''(sighs in relief)'' That was close! ''(her stomach grumbles)'' What's going on? ''(folds her arms around her stomach...)'' I'm... ''(...and looks at the kwamis, now possessed by Tikki's uncontrollable cravings)'' '''''starving!!''''' 
'''The rest of the Kwamis''': Uh-oh!!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|Dupain-Cheng Residence]], living room. Gina, Rolland, Tom and Sabine continue to argue.}}
<poem>
'''Rolland''': What Marinette needs is some rules of discipline!
'''Gina''': Nonsense! What she needs is more freedom!
'''Tom''': What she needs is a dad who can protect her from everything!!
'''Sabine''': The person who knows best what Marinette needs is Marinette herself!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair]].}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': A family divided by a tradition that was supposed to bring them together! How terribly sad! ''(opens his hand to corrupt a butterfly...)'' Luckily, I just have the recipe to reconcile them! ''(...and turns it into a megakuma)'' Fly away, my megakuma, and once again, plunge this family into darkness!
''(The megakuma flies out the window, now targeted towards the Dupain-Cheng family.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Tom & Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|Dupain-Cheng Residence]], living room. The megakuma breaks the magical charm's protection and enters in the charm inserted in the galette.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Dearest Family, I am Shadow Moth. Don't worry, your magical charms won't stop you from getting your powers back.
''(The magical charms on Sabine and Rolland's hand are destroyed.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Each of you thinks they know Marinette better than the others. To help you figure this out, I'm returning your powers to all of you.
''(The megakuma's power engulf Tom, Sabine, Rolland and Gina, transforming them into Weredad, Qilin, Bakerix and Befana, respectively.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Weredad, Bakerix, Befana, and Qilin, may the strongest of you raise Marinette as they please! But in return, bring me the Miraculous of Ladybug and Cat Noir.
'''Befana''': I'm coming, Marinetta. ''(twirls her gun on her fingers)'' Your Befana will set you free!
'''Bakerix''': That's not how it's done! I'll give you the discipline you need!
'''Weredad''': I'm the only one that can protect my little girl!
'''Qilin''': Marinette! I won't let them control your life!
''(The four of them race the stairs to Marinette's room.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Marinette's room]]. Ladybug feels the room rumbling as her akumatized family downstairs attempt to open her trapdoor all at once.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': ''(to the kwamis)'' Quick, hide!
''(The kwamis find their places to hide as Ladybug gets on her feet up on the balcony. Weredad breaks the trapdoor.)''
'''Weredad''': My baby's not here!
'''Bakerix''': ''(points at the open balcony trapdoor)'' She snuck out!
'''Qilin''': ''(to Weredad)'' You frightened her!
'''Bakerix''': ''(to Weredad)'' It's your fault!
'''Weredad''': ''(to Bakerix)'' No, your fault!
'''Befana''': ''(to Weredad)'' No, it's yours!
'''Qilin''': ''(to Befana)'' No, yours!
'''Bakerix''': No, it's yours!
'''Weredad''': It's yours!
''(The four of them continue to argue. Weredad breaks the roof above Marinette's room.)''
'''Weredad''': Marinette!!!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Parisian rooftops. Ladybug escapes Dearest Family. She slips her feet and tumbles on the roof, hitting a wall, sending her exhausted lying on her back. Her stomach continues to grumble.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': ''(whimpers, clutching her stomach)'' Oh, I'm so hungry! It's impossible to resist these cravings! I need... ''(sniffs and spots Mayor Bourgeois with a box of galette)''
'''André''': Finally! I got them! I got them! ''(holds his box of galette above his head only to be snatched by Ladybug using her yo-yo)'' AHH! My galette! ''(whines)'' No!!!
''(Still above the roofs. Ladybug starts to eat large slices of galette.)''
'''Ladybug''': Did I just steal these? ''(inserts two slices of galette in her mouth)'' I've done something terrible! ''(swallows the galette)'' What's gotten into me??
'''Bakerix''': That's because you need discipline, Ladybug! Just like my granddaughter! ''(takes his bottle of yeast and drinks eat and becomes buffer)''
''(Ladybug evades his attack, leaping to another rooftop.)''
'''Bakerix''': Give me your Miraculous! 
''(Bakerix continues his attempt to catch Ladybug as she constantly dodge her attacks before she jumps on him and leaps to another rooftop once again.)''  
'''Ladybug''': ''(eats another two slices of galette)'' I can't stop! This galette is so good! 
'''Bakerix''': Galettes are not to be stolen, but eaten as a family! Miraculous is mine!
''(Bakerix grabs Ladybug by her feet as [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] enters the scene, hitting him with his baton before Bakerix could take off Ladybug's earrings.)''
'''Cat Noir''': Hey, that looks delicious, m'lady! Save me a piece?
'''Ladybug''': No way, kitty! But thanks for the helping hand! I need you to deal with Bakerix. ''(puts a few pieces of galette in her arms)'' I've got an emergency!
'''Cat Noir''': Sure. Piece of cake! ''(to Bakerix)'' Don't move or you're toast!
''(Ladybug runs to an alleyway with the pieces of galette in her arms.)''
'''Ladybug''': Spots off! 
''(She de-transforms into Marinette. Tikki lands on her hands full of slices of galette, eating them ceaselessly.)'' 
'''Marinette''': Tikki! What's going on? So, Sass was right? I don't know you as well as... I thought?
'''Tikki''': ''(looking down)'' Sorry, Marinette... ''(looks up to Marinette with a crazy expression)'' '''''but I need more!!'''''
'''Marinette''': AHH!! ''(Tikki flies away)'' Tikki, wait! Tikki, spots—
'''Befana''': Marinetta! My fairy!
'''Marinette''': Grandma!
''(Befana's two white "fairies" corner Marinette behind her.)''
'''Befana''': Bravo, my angels! Thanks to you, I'm the one who found Marinetta first! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Parisian streets. Cat Noir is still being chased by Bakerix. He then gets tackled by Weredad from behind.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': Hey! No fair, attacking from behind!
'''Bakerix''': Hey! I was the one about to take his Miraculous!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(smiles deviously)'' Ladybug!
'''Weredad''': Huh? ''(releases Cat Noir from his arms)''
'''Cat Noir''': Ha-ha! I never thought I'd fool anyone with that silly old— AHH! ''(He gets thrown up in the air by Qilin. He lands on the ground and tries to escape, but it was too late now that Qilin, Bakerix and Weredad cornered him.)'' Cataclysm! ''(breaks the ground, taking advantage of the dust he created to escape)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Don't let him elude you! Cat Noir's only bought himself some time. He's used his Cataclysm so he'll soon transform back! Follow him! ''(takes a bite of his galette)'' His Miraculous will be the charm in my galette.
''(Qilin, Weredad and Bakerix look down on the hole created by Cat Noir's Cataclysm. Befana flies just above them with Marinette.)''
'''Befana''': ''(sing-song)'' I found Marinetta! I'm the one that found her!
'''Bakerix''': Befana found my little sweetie?
'''Weredad''': She's ''my'' Marinette!
'''Qilin''': Marinette doesn't belong to anyone!
''(The three of them leap on the roofs to chase after Befana.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair, dropping the galette from his hands)'' No! Come back!!
''(Weredad wraps his vines on Befana's motorcycle and pulls them on the roofs.)''
'''Bakerix''': That broom's just like the bike; it's not for kids!!
'''Qilin''': There's no way we'll let you impose your bad habits on Marinette!!
'''Befana''': You don't know what she needs!
'''Weredad''': I'm the only one who knows how to raise her right!
''(Marinette makes her escape back to the ground.)''
'''Parisian 1''': My galette!! Where did it go?!
'''Parisian 2''': Who stole my galette??
'''Parisian 3''': That weird bug just ate my galette!
'''Marinette''': ''(shocked, gasps)'' Tikki??
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sewers. Cat Noir walks feebly. His back slides down the wall and sits down.}}
<poem>
'''Cat Noir''': Claws in! ''(de-transforms into Adrien)''
''(He brings out a camembert to feed [[Plagg]], who is laying weakly on his palm.)''
'''Adrien''': Get your strength back, Plagg. We're not out of this yet!
''(Plagg takes a bite from his camembert.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Jardin des Tuileries]]. Empty boxes are scattered around the place. Marinette arrives to find Tikki as a man runs away screaming, seeing Tikki finishing off the galettes from cake to crumbs.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Tikki! ''(The kwami continues to feed off the galettes from the boxes.)'' Tikki, you can't stay here! People aren't supposed to see you! Come with me!
'''Tikki''': I'm sorry, Marinette. I just can't help myself! ''(puts her hands on her face)''
'''Marinette''': You've gotta try to keep it together, Tikki. My family's been re-akumatized! I need you!
''(Tikki tries to resist but fails, and so she flies to another box, containing a small piece of galette.)''
'''Tikki''': Oh, there's only one piece left. It means if I eat it, it'll be all gone! Ohh...! I know how to get more! ''(grunts as she uses her power, a powerful pink aura of energy surrounding her)''
'''Marinette''': Tikki, no! A kwami that uses their power without their owner always causes a disaster!
'''Tikki''': '''''I'm the kwami of creation!!!!''''' ''(summons a burst of energy, leaving Marinette in complete shock)'' '''''LUCKY CHARM!!!!!!!!''''' 
''(Using her power of creation, a large beam creates a ginormous ladybug-patterned galette, overshadowing the whole city of Paris.)''

<poem>
'''Plagg''': Uh-oh, Sugar Cube's used her power!
'''Adrien''': Sugar Cube?
'''Plagg''': Tikki, Ladybug's kwami.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Jardin des Tuileries]].}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Tikki! I'm begging you! Stop this! Control yourself!
'''Tikki''': But Marinette, I'm just making the biggest galette in the world!!!
''(Tikki continues to use her Lucky Charm to create one giant galette, with bridges starting to crack, as well as the Montparnasse Tower.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the sewers.}}
<poem>
'''Plagg''': Looks like Tikki's got a little case of the munchies again.
'''Adrien''': "Little"?
'''Plagg''': The last time was centuries ago when humans discovered chocolate. It rained chocolate mousse for eight weeks! ''(groans)'' Don't look so worried. There's a reason there's also a kwami of destruction! ''(winks)'' Come on, Adrien! Transform!
'''Adrien''': Plagg, claws out! ''(transforms into Cat Noir)''
''(He begins to run up on the ground and launches himself with his baton to stop the giant galette from growing much larger.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(upon launching)'' Power up! ''(transforms into Astro Cat)''
''(He flies into space towards the giant galette that Tikki made.)''
'''Astro Cat''': Cataclysm! ''(activates his power and touches the giant galette, creating a giant explosion in space as he flies back to Earth)''
''(Back at the Jardin des Tulieries, the skies clear up and Tikki becomes frustrated.)''
'''Tikki''': Oh, no! It's okay! I'll just make another one! ''(uses her power for the second time)'' An even ''BIGGER ONE!!!''
'''Marinette''': So, Sass was right. But... why didn't you tell me anything?
'''Tikki''': ''(cools down)'' I was afraid you'd think less of me... because of my cravings.
'''Marinette''': Oh! Of course, not! I'll always like you, Tikki! Everyone has weaknesses, you know? ''(reaches out her hand)'' Let me help you overcome yours, just like you're always helping me overcome mine. ''(Tikki's stomach continues to rumble)'' You ''can'' resist! I have faith in you! Look at me! ''(Tikki flies to hold Marinette's hand and Marinette cups her in them)'' Bravo! ''(goes to hide behind a tree)'' Now, Tikki, spots on!

<poem>
'''Qilin''': No, it's yours!
'''Weredad''': ''(notices that Marinette is missing)'' My baby! Where'd she go?
''(The four of them jump back on the ground.)''
'''Qilin''': Marinette?
'''Weredad''': Marinette!
''(Back on the rooftops, Ladybug joins Cat Noir.)''
'''Ladybug''': Thanks for your help with the galette, kitty cat.
'''Cat Noir''': How's your kwami? Better?
'''Ladybug''': Yes. It won't happen again.
'''Cat Noir''': How could Shadow Moth get to the Dupain-Cheng family again? Didn't you give them magical charms?
'''Ladybug''': I did, but maybe he found a way of overpowering their magic. But that's not gonna stop us from saving them again!
'''Dearest Family''': Marinette!
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir leap to the ground to face the four of them. The battle ensues, starting with Bakerix throwing a car at the superheroes. The two split after the dodging the car as Cat Noir faces Qilin and Weredad, evading their attacks as well. He then rejoins Ladybug by her side.)''
'''Ladybug''': We've gotta find where Shadow Moth's akuma is hiding!
''(Befana fires at Ladybug and Cat Noir and the two avoid it. Ladybug grapples her yo-yo on Befana's legs, with Cat Noir knocking both Befana, as well as Bakerix. Bakerix's yeast bottle falls from his waist and Ladybug takes the opportunity to grab it with her yo-yo, breaking it, only with no akuma flying out of it.)
'''Ladybug''': ''(gasps)'' Nothing!
'''Cat Noir''': Maybe this one? ''(breaks Befana's candy box, and no akuma is yet to be seen)''
'''Befana''': ''(continues to fire at them)'' You won't stop us from giving Marinette the freedom she needs! 
''(Ladybug continuously evades all of Befana's attacks.)''
'''Bakerix''': No freedom without discipline!
'''Weredad''': She's ''my'' baby!
'''Qilin''': Marinette is old enough to know what is right for her! The only one she needs is me!
'''Ladybug''': The akuma must be in an object that's the same for all four villains.
'''Cat Noir''': Better find it quickly!
'''Ladybug''': [[Lucky Charm]]! ''(uses her power and gets a [[List of Lucky Charm objects|paper crown]])'' A... crown? Of course! The akuma's in the galette, at home!
'''Cat Noir''': At home?
'''Ladybug''': Uh— What I mean is... at ''their'' home! The Dupain-Cheng home! They must have eaten galette too, as a family! And the akuma's is there. I mean, I'm guessing so... stop them from following me!
'''Cat Noir''': No, not again!

<poem>
'''Befana''': ''(behind the door)'' Quick! This way!
''(Dearest Family attempts to break the door.)'' 
'''Cat Noir''': ''(pushing the door shut)'' I did what I could!
''(Ladybug's stomach grumbles and resists to not put the slice of galette in her mouth. She thinks of an idea and runs towards Cat Noir.)''
'''Ladybug''': Special delivery! ''(hands the slice of galette to Cat Noir)''
'''Cat Noir''': Thank you, m'lady! ''(pulls the charm inside the galette)'' And I got the charm! I'm the king! Cataclysm! ''(activates his power and breaks the charm containing the megakuma)'' What in the—
'''Ladybug''': A more powerful akuma! So that's how Shadow Moth broke the magical charms! No more evil doing for you, big butterfly! ''(opens her yo-yo)'' Time to de-evilize! ''(captures the megakuma)'' Gotcha! ''(releases the purified akuma. fluttering away)'' Bye-bye, little butterfly!
''(Dearest Family is now de-akumatized and transform back to their civilian forms.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(grabs a golden paper crown on the coffee table)'' Since I'm the king, ''(wears the crown on his head)'' would you be my queen, Ladybug?
'''Ladybug''': With pleasure, kitty cat! Tradition is tradition!
''(Cat Noir puts on the paper crown lucky charm on Ladybug.)''
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir''': Pound it!
'''Ladybug''': [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]!
''(She throws the paper crown in the air and fixes all the damages caused by the villains and Tikki's craving mayhem. The magical ladybugs bring the Dupain-Cheng family safely back on the living room couch. She swipes her yo-yo open and grabs four charms for the Dupain-Cheng family and distributes it to them.)''
'''Ladybug''': I can't promise that these magical charms will protect you from Shadow Moth. Maybe they'll help you eat your galette in peace!
''(The two heroes make their exit as they vault to the roofs, with Ladybug returning shortly after to de-transform inside her bedroom. Tikki lands on Marinette's palms.)''
'''Marinette''': There you go! You finally get to taste Dad and Grandpa's famous galette!
'''The rest of the kwamis''': ''(gather around Marinette's hand full of crumbs of galette)'' Woah!!
'''Sass''': In front of Tikki..?
'''Marinette''': Go ahead! Tikki's controlling herself very well! ''(pats Tikki's head with her thumb)''
''(The kwamis disperse after grabbing their own pieces of galette from Marinette's hand.)''
'''Tikki''': I'm really sorry, Marinette. I thought I'd never have one of those craving episodes again, but the galette your family created is really an exceptional event in the culinary history of humanity!
'''Marinette''': ''(chuckles softly)'' I don't blame you, Tikki. But what are we gonna do next year on Galette Day?
'''Tikki''': I've given it some thought! I'm sure that I can reduce my cravings if I just eat galette more often!
''(The two share a little laughter before Marinette gives Tikki a piece of galette.)''

<poem>
'''Gina''': Marinetta, we're really sorry. We got all into an argument about this bike.
'''Rolland''': Because each of us thought we knew what was right for you.
'''Tom''': But none of us thought to ask...
'''Sabine''': ...how you were feeling about it.
'''Marinette''': Actually, you all know me pretty well! This bike will be awesome, in a few years. However, I'd be super excited to have an electric mini scooter!
''(Gina, Tom, Sabine, and Rolland are in shock.)''
'''Tom''': Uh— A scooter's okay but with a helmet, right?
'''Sabine''': See, I told you she would be solo.
''(Marinette smiles.)''
''(The end card shows Marinette riding a mini scooter while passing out galettes, while her family except her grandmother (who is cheering for her) has worried expressions)''

'''Gabriel''': Emilie, my queen, Ladybug and Cat Noir escaped me again today, but I will never give up. I will get their Miraculous. Thanks to the all powerful forces of destruction and creation, I'll destroy this world that took you from us to build a new one, where we'll never be apart again. I will succeed, Emilie. Whatever the cost.
