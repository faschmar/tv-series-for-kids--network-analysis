{{Scene|Scene: Interior, [[Marinette's room]]. Inside the [[Chinese Miracle Box|Miracle Box]], [[Ziggy]], [[Sass]], and [[Barkk]] look terrified.}}
<poem>
'''Ziggy''': ''(scared)'' Oh... she's coming closer!
''([[Manon Chamack|Manon]], who is causing the rumbling inside the Miracle Box, attempts to open it. Meanwhile, [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] organizes the scattered toys around her room. She then sees Manon forcefully pulling the Miracle Box open.)''
'''Marinette''': Manon! ''(chuckles nervously)'' How about we do some drawing? You like drawing, right? ''(opens her drawer that is full of her doodles of Adrien)'' AHH! Let's play hide-and-seek instead! ''(lifts Manon to her other side)'' ...Okay?
'''Manon''': YEAAAH!
''([[Xuppu]] and [[Kaalki]] shake their heads 'no' from behind a beam.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(panics)'' Oh! Wait! I...know, I know! Uh, beads! We'll make some bead and necklaces! ''(drops the jewelry box and the beads scatter on the floor)''
''([[Ella and Etta Césaire|Ella and Etta]] arrive inside Marinette's room.)''
'''Manon''': Yeah! Ella! Etta!
'''Ella and Etta''': Manon!
''([[Alya Césaire|Alya]] follows the twins from behind. She finds Marinette already babysitting Manon.)''
'''Alya''': Shoot! You didn't tell me you're already babysitting Manon. I'll go cancel my date with Nino at the movies.
'''Marinette''': Oh, no, don't! Uhh... the more, the... more pretty necklaces we can make!
'''Alya''': ''(worried)'' Are you sure?
'''Marinette''': ''(puts the jewelry box back on her table)'' Come on, just go enjoy your movie!
'''Alya''': Okay! Buzz me if you need me! ''(closes the trapdoor)''
''(Back with the kids, Manon, Ella and Etta run to the other side of the room with the storage box containing the Miracle Box. Marinette runs to them in panic and trips on her chaise lounge as they continue to shake it recklessly. The kwamis inside the Miracle Box are joggled around as they keep on shaking it. Marinette then grabs the box away from them.)''
'''Marinette''': Not the [[Marinette's sewing box|sewing box]]!
''(Manon, Ella and Etta stare blankly and abruptly at Marinette as they shifted their eyes to one another, planning a mischievous plan: tickling Marinette.)'' 
'''Marinette''': ''(laughs)'' Don't! Stop, that's not fair!
''(As the kids keep on tickling her, [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]] and [[Chris Lahiffe|Chris]] arrive in Marinette's room.)''
'''Nino''': ''(peeking from the trapdoor)'' Oh. You didn't tell me you're already babysitting Manon and the twins.
'''Marinette''': Ah! One more kid won't make any difference. ''(places the box beside her)'' Go to the movies with your girlfriend.
'''Nino''': Wow! Thank you, Marinette! You really are the best! ''(closes the trapdoor)''
''(As Nino left the room, Marinette looks at the kids who are already rashly playing with the kwamis.)''
'''Marinette''': No! Not the kw— ''(covers her mouth)'' kwa-shies!
'''Ella''': Kwa-shies? Did you make them yourself?
'''Marinette''': Oh! Yes! They're my most recent sewing project. But it's a secret project, so you gotta put them back in the drawer—
'''Ella''': ''(throws Kaalki in the air)'' I'm gonna call this one Sock!
'''Etta''': ''(catches Kaalki and throws her again)'' Fly, Sock, fly!
'''Ella''': Throw it to me!
''(Manon and Chris are tugging [[Fluff]] by the ears.)''
'''Manon''': I saw the bunny first!
'''Chris''': No, ''I'' did! No, me!
'''Manon''': No, ''me!''
'''Marinette''': Oh! A movie! How about we all watch a fun movie together instead?
'''Manon, Chris, Ella and Etta''': ''(drop the kwamis on the floor)'' YAY! ''(the four of them sit on the floor in front of the monitor in unison)'' [[Les aventures de Ladybug & Chat Noir|Ladybug and Cat Noir]]!
''(Marinette groans in annoyance.)''
'''Manon''': Don't you like it?
'''Marinette''': Yes! I do! I love it so much that I've seen it maybe one too many times. 
''(She opens her computer and plays the movie. Seeing the kids finally settle, she plops on her chair and sighs in relief just right before her phone began to ring. She brings out her phone and sees [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] calling her.)''
'''Marinette''': Adrien? Woohoo! Adrien! Oh, Adrien! Adrien!
'''Manon''': Aren't you gonna answer it?
'''Marinette''': Of course, I am! I'm answering, and speaking to him! Very normally. ''(press the button from her phone and calls)'' Adri-mine? Uh! Adrien, how are you? You need me to do you a... favor?
'''Adrien''': ''(from the [[Eiffel Tower]], calling Marinette)'' There's no one here on the set to repair it. And since I know how talented you are with sewing, I was hoping you could come and give me a hand.
'''Marinette''': In marriage? I'd love to! I didn't mean that first part or the second part. I mean, I'd love to help you, not marry you. Heh-heh! ''(declines)'' Operation Adrien's Rescue is a go. I'm jumping directly from level 2, "talking to him", to level 48, "doing Adrien a favor"! And once I've helped him out, since he's so nice, polite, and grateful... He'll ask me:
'''Marinette''': ''(as Adrien)'' How can I ever thank you, Marinette?
'''Marinette''': Well, Adrien, I've love it if you'd go to the movies with me to see "The Umbrellas of Deauville"!
'''Marinette''': ''(as Adrien)'' How amazing, Marinette! That's my favorite film!
'''Marinette''': So, then, we'll go to the 3:17PM screening, because there's an 89.5% chance we'll pass [[André]], the ice cream man, on the way. We'll share a sweet hearts ice cream cone, which will make us miss the beginning of the movie, and --
'''Manon''': ''(interrupts)'' Wouldn't it be more simple to just give him your drawing?
''(Manon holds up Marinette's doodle of Adrien.)''
'''Marinette''': Huh! No, no! Telling a boy you like him is way more complicated than a drawing.
''(Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris grab their backpacks which shows Ladybug, Cat Noir, and Rena Rouge on their backpacks.)''
'''Manon''': It's gonna be so cool to see you do it!
'''Marinette''': W-Wait a second. Sorry! ''(puts their backpacks back and pushes Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris)'' You're not gonna see anything. You're gonna be good, and stay...
''([[Wayzz]] appears behind her computer and replies 'no'.)''
'''Marinette''': ...Ha-ha, not here at all! You guys are gonna go... ''(pushes them again and stops)'' Oh...
''(Marinette changes her mind and thinks about her [[Sabine Cheng|mom]] and [[Tom Dupain|dad]] leaving.)''
'''Tom''': We're off to the Chocolate Convention. See you tonight, sweetheart.
'''Marinette''': Oh...
''(Marinette then thinks about her [[Gina Dupain|grandmother]].)''
'''Gina''': I'm learning kung fu in China, sweetie. Remember? Oh! And I met a little girl who reminds me so much of you.
'''Marinette''': Nope...
''(Finally, she thinks about her [[Rolland Dupain|grandfather]].)''
'''Rolland''': Why would I want to go out? I like it just fine here at home!
'''Marinette''': ''(smiles)'' That's perfect!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Rolland Dupain's house.}}
<poem>
'''Rolland''': No, no, no, and no again! Babysitting is too complicated! I got Brioche loaves to bake and-
'''Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris''': YAY! ''(they rush inside Rolland's house)''
''(Marinette chuckles and walks inside.)''
'''Manon''': Wow! ''(picks up a vinyl)'' Wow! What's this frisbee made of?
'''Marinette''': No, it's fragile!
'''Chris''': Yeah, yeah, yeah!
'''Marinette''': Chris, no! STOP! Give me that!
'''Rolland''': First, a game of darts, then I'll show you kids how to make a potato cannon!
'''Ella and Etta''': YEAH!
'''Marinette''': NO! ''(chuckles)'' Forget the potato cannon and the darts. Too dangerous. Just keep it simple, Grandpa! Let them watch a cartoon!
'''Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris''': YEAH!
''(Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris rush to the couch in excitement.)''
'''Rolland''': You call that "simple"? What are all these buttons anyway, and where do you put the video cassette?!
'''Marinette''': This is a laptop computer, and this is the keyboard. You don't need a cassette. The film is already on the hard drive.
'''Rolland''': Now you want me to drive somewhere to get the film? But that's not how it's done!
'''Marinette''': Don't worry, Grandpa. You don't have to drive anywhere! The kids know how to use it.
''(Rolland notices Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris smiling at him as Marinette kisses Rolland on the cheek.)''
'''Marinette''': I'll be back as soon as I can. Thank you, Grandpa! Be quiet, kids! Goodbye! ''(closes the door)''
'''Rolland''': Hmm...
''(Outside, Marinette leaves Rolland's house and holds the gate shut.)''
'''Marinette''': And now, let's go save Adrien! ''(rushes off)''
''(Inside, Rolland puts both of the bread in the over and hears Cat Noir, offscreen and on the laptop.)''
'''Cat Noir''': [[Cataclysm]]!
''(Rolland shuts the oven door and walks over to Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris watching "[[Ladybug PV]]" on the laptop.)''
'''Rolland''': Hang on. I don't get it. The villain is that cat girl?
'''Etta''': ''(giggles)'' Of course not! He's a boy!
'''Chris''': And, and Cat Noir's a good guy!
'''Rolland''': Since when do good guys break everything?
'''Manon''': He's not breaking stuff! He's doing the Cataclysm thing to help Ladybug win!
'''Rolland''': Oh, okay. So, this [[Fred Haprèle|Mime]] guy, he's the bad guy?
'''Ella''': No! [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] is the bad guy. He waits until the Mime gets really mad so he can akumatize him. And then he makes him think Ladybug and Cat Noir are the bad guys!
'''Rolland''': Argh! In my day, telling good guys from bad guys was much simpler! They would just fight each other and whoever was the strongest one wins!
'''Manon''': Oh, but Ladybug never hits anybody, 'cause she has her [[Lucky Charm]]!
'''Rolland''': Oh, what was this thingalucky now? 
'''Chris''': It's a thing she uses with other stuff to catch the [[akuma]]!
'''Etta''': And then she wins!
'''Rolland''': Stop, stop. This is way too complicated! Let's just watch my VHS copy of the '98 World Cup finals. At least that's something simple!
''(Rolland turns off the laptop with his VHS copy, and Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris are saddened.)''
'''Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris''': NOOOOOOOOOO!!!

{{Scene|Scene: Eiffel Tower.}}
<poem>
''(Marinette puts his wings on Adrien's back.)''
'''Marinette''': Perfect!
'''Adrien''': I'm so glad I thought to call you, Marinette. How can I ever thank you?
''(Marinette dreams, flies dreamily and smiles.)''
'''Marinette''': How would you like to be 89.5% late for a movie?
'''Adrien''': Hmm?
'''Marinette''': I meant to sing under the umbrellas of ice cream! AAAH! I'm so pleased that you're thanking me, and now I can't thank you enough for thanking me. Uh, no! What I meant to say was-
'''Adrien''': Marinette, you don't need to thank me. I'm the one thanking you! I have to go now. See you later! ''(leaves)''
'''Marinette''': Uh, well, uh, thanks for saying thanks. ''(changes her confession)'' UGGH! I messed it all up, as usual!
'''[[Tikki]]''': Don't you think you made it harder than it needed to be?
'''Marinette''': You're right, Tikki. I need a second chance.
''(Marinette gasps and see a fishing rod a person was holding.)''
'''Marinette''': I know! ''(runs faster)'' I'll just have to break the wing again! I'll set up a fishing rod and drop a hook to rip it! That way, Adrien will have to call me, so I'll come repair his wing again, and he'll say thank you again, and-
'''Tikki''': ''(interrupts)'' But that's even more complicated!
'''Marinette''': Love is always complicated, Tikki.
''(Marinette's phone rings as she calls Rolland on the phone.)''
'''Rolland''': MARINETTE, I'M COMPLETELY LOST!
'''Marinette''': That's great news, Grandpa, but I can't talk right now. I have to borrow a fishing rod! Have fun! I'll be back soon!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Seine]].}}
<poem>
''(Marinette stops running and almost trips over and stands nervously.)''
'''Marinette''': Hey! Nice fishing rod!
'''Unnamed person with a fishing rod''': Uh... You think?
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Rolland's house.}}
<poem>
'''Rolland''': MARINETTE!?!
''(Manon is getting chased by Etta, Ella is jumping on the couch, and Chris starts tickling Ella.)''
'''Rolland''': What is wrong with the world these days?! Why has everything become so complicated?! Waaaah!!!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Shadow Moth's lair.}}
<poem>
''(Shadow Moth's window opens.)''
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]]''': Ah! The overwhelming confusion of a grandfather faced with the complexities of our modern world. How difficult it is to adapt, especially when one is trapped in the past! ''(turns a butterfly into an [[akuma]])'' Fly away, my little Akuma, and help him simplify this all-too-complicated world!
''(The Akuma flies away.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Rolland's house.}}
<poem>
''(The Akuma flies into the chimney and lands in Rolland's spatula.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Unravelder, I am Shadow Moth.
'''Rolland''': Unravelder? What kind of complicated name is that?
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(clears throat)'' Well, uh... Doctor Obsolete?
'''Rolland''': I'm not a Doctor!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(groans)'' How about Simpleman? Will that do?
'''Rolland''': There! Now that's simple!
'''Shadow Moth''': Well, then, Simpleman, Ladybug and Cat Noir are also complicating my life. That's why I'm giving you the power to simplify everything.
'''Rolland''': Ah! Now ''that'' I understand!
''(Rolland transforms into Simpleman.)''
'''Manon''': Oh, no! Grandpa Rolland!
'''Chris''': You got akumatized because of us?
''(Simpleman stomps on one foot and greets Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris.)''
'''Simpleman''': Don't worry, kids. You're not a problem at all. The problem is the world around you! I'm going to show you how much better life can be with everything is simpler! ''(cracks his back)'' Oh! Argh!
'''Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris''': Hmm...
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' And don't forget the simplest mission of all. Bring me back Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.
'''Simpleman''': Piece of cake! One blow from this baker's peel, and EVERYONE WILL BE HIT, SUPERHERO OR NOT!
'''Shadow Moth''': No! Wait!
'''Simpleman''': SIMPLIFICATION!!!
''(Simpleman uses his power to make everything simpler.)''
'''Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris''': Oh, no!
''(The power makes everything in Paris go worse.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Argh! Foolish villain! You hit me! I'm taking back your power!
'''Simpleman''': Make up your mind already, do you want your Miraculous or not?
'''Shadow Moth''': Hmm... Yes. Go ahead.
'''Simpleman''': You see how simple life can be when nothing is complicated?

{{Scene|Scene: The Parisian streets.}}
<poem>
''(The civilian is driving a car when he sees another car passing by.)
'''Civilian 1''': Hm.
''(Both cars crash into each other.)''
'''Civilian 1''': Why didn't you stop instead of driving right into me?
'''Civilian 2''': Turning's too complicated! All you had to do was back up!
'''Civilian 1''': Backing up is even more complicated! I'd rather just go straight, it's simpler!
'''[[Roger Raincomprix|Roger]]''': ''(gets off of the car)'' Since you're not letting me through, I'm prohibiting all cars! It'll be simpler this way. Car prohibited! Prohibited! Prohibited! And prohibited again!
'''[[Nadja Chamack|Nadja]]''': I, Nadja, the reporter inside the TV, tell you all about the things happening around us. And today, things are going pretty badly, right, [[Clara Contard|Clara]]?
'''Clara''': Yes, I'm Clara, and I'm a reporter in a helicopter! There are many problems in Paris! People are not happy at all, because their cars are immobilised!
''(Inside the helicopter.)''
'''Cameraman''': I can't see anything, the helicopter is going to fast!
'''Clara''': Stop, pilot. We can't see the cars anymore!
'''Pilot''': Uh... stop? Ah, there! There.
''(The pilot stops the airplane and gives a thumbs up. All of them scream as airplane falls down.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Eiffel Tower]].}}
<poem>
''(Vincent takes photos of Adrien while Marinette is lowering the fishing rod)''
'''Vincent''': Mah, this photo session is too complicated, we just got to take photos of Adrien smiling, it would be more simple.
''(Adrien starts taking of the rope behind him while Marinette is lowering the fishing rod)''
'''Marinette''': Why am I complicating my life with this fishing rod? I'm just gonna tell Adrien that I love him.
''(Marinette walks to Adrien)''
'''Marinette''': Adrien! Adrien!
''(People from the helicopter screams for help as the helicopter is falling down.)''
'''Marinette''': Oh, a falling helicopter! What should I do? Oh, I know! I have to transform!
'''Tikki''': Careful, Marinette, it's a secret. You should hide first.
'''Marinette''': Oh, right! But where can I hide?
''(Marinette starts looking for a place to hide)''
'''Marinette''': In the elevator, behind a metal pillar? It's a very hard choice.
''(Plane crashes)''
'''Marinette''': Woah! Oh no, it took me way to long to think and now the helicopter's crashed!
'''Clara, Cameraman, and pilot''': Help! Ladybug, Cat Noir, save us!
''(Marinette tries to get through a maze and gets behind the piller)''
'''Marinette''': Come on, Tikki. Spots on!
''(Marinette transforms into Ladybug and goes to help.)''
'''Vincent''': Okay guys, that's enough for today. I got all I need.
(People still scream for help)
'''Adrien''': I'm supposed to smile, but I'm supposed to save people. This is a complicated choice.
'''Plagg''': The simplest thing to do is to would be to stay here and eat cheese!
''(Plagg gobbles up a camembert)''
'''Adrien''': No, Plagg! The simplest thing is to do as Ladybug does. She's always right, and I love her. So I'll just do what she does!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Under the Eiffel Tower.}}
<poem>
''(Adren runs to find a place and transforms)''
'''Adrien''': Plagg, claws out!
''(Cat Noir runs and helps Ladybug save the people)''
'''Pilot''': Thank you, Cat Noir!
'''Cameraman''': Thanks!
'''Clara''': Thank you Ladybug!
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir look at each other)''
'''Ladybug''': When bad things happen, it's simply the fault of the big bad-
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir''': SHADOW MOTH!
'''Cat Noir''': An akumatized villain is going to want to fight us so they can steal our Miraculous!
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir groans)''
'''Ladybug''': Oh, boy, it's gonna be really complicated.
'''Cat Noir''': Wouldn't it be simpler to fight Shadow Moth directly?
'''Ladybug''': Oh, of course!
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir''': Let's go!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene:}}
<poem>
'''Recycling Man''': Everything into the trash, much simpler.
'''Ella''': Simpleman! I want a Chocolate Pistachio cone!
''(Simpleman looks at Ella as Ella points to André the ice cream maker)''
'''Etta''': And I want caramel hazelnut and cherry!
'''André''': Oh, sorry, children, it's just vanilla now. Having only one flavor is much more simple!
'''Simpleman''': Now that's much better.
'''Ella''': I liked it better when everything was less simple.
''(A pizza box falls right in front of them they all gasp and look up to find more pizza boxes falling on them. Simpleman protects the children by staking the pizza boxes while they scream.)''
''(Simpleman throws the pizza boxes back at the delivery man)''
'''Simpleman''': Hey! What's going on?
''(A pizza box falls on Simpleman's head)''
'''Pizza Delivery guy''': Veggie pizza for everyone! Only one choice of topping, it's much simpler!
'''Simpleman''': Meh, that's true!
'''Manon''': Seems kinda dangerous when things are simple. Don't you think?
'''Chris''': Ladybug and Cat Noir will be here soon. Don't worry.
'''Ladybug''': HEY!! SHADOW MOTH, WE'RE HERE!
'''Cat Noir''': Come and fight us!
'''Simpleman''': You see that kids? Simplified heroes means easily found Miraculous. Come on! Let's simply pick them up!
'''Shadow Moth''':  ''(from his lair)'' Ha-ha! And I will stay hidden! That way I will win easily!
'''Ladybug''': Hey, Shadow Moth!!
'''Cat Noir''': Yoohoo!!
'''Simpleman''': Ladybug! Cat Noir!
''(The both look at Simpleman and jump.)''
'''Simpleman''': Give me your Miraculous!
'''Ella and Etta''': We're going to see the Lucky Charm for real! This is better than watching the movie!
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir''': No!
'''Simpleman''': ''(pause)'' Yes!
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir''': No!
'''Simpleman''': YES!
''(Ladybug attempts to fight with Simpleman but fails.)''
'''Simpleman''': Ha-ha-ha!
''(Cat Noir attempts to fight with Simpleman.)''
'''Manon''': There's usually more action.
'''Chris''': What if the bad guy wins?
'''Manon''': It'll be okay, Chris. Superheroes always win!
''(Ladybug aims her Yo-yo.)''
'''Ladybug''': Fighting is much more simple!
'''Cat Noir''': When nothing's complicated anymore!
''(Cat Noir tickles Simpleman.)''
'''Simpleman''': I haven't simplified you enough!
''(Simpleman swings his weapon to get rid of Cat Noir, Cat Noir and Ladybug both fall down.)''
'''Simpleman''': Simplification!
''(Simpleman uses his powers to simplify Paris.)''
'''Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris''': NO!
'''Nadja''': I'm Na-Na! Cla-Cla no longer here! Paris is all broken! Bug-Bug, Meow-Meow, help!
'''Parisian 1''': Vroom-vroom is too complicated!
''(People start walking out from their cars)''
'''Parisian 2''': I walk home with my feet now!
''(Officer rogers blows his whistle and makes all civilians go inside his car to get arrested)''
'''Officer Rogers''': Jail, jail, jail, jail!
'''Parisian 3''': What for?
'''Officer Rogers''': Hm... uh, me upset. Jail.
'''Manon''': Quick Ladybug! Use your Lucky Charm to fight the villain!
'''Ladybug''': [[Lucky Charm]]?
''(Ladybug summons her Lucky Charm and gets a [[List of Lucky Charm objects|ball]].)''
'''Ladybug''': Wow! Cool! Hey Simpleman, take this!
''(Ladybug throws the ball but it bounces and hits Ladybug instead. The ball rolls under a car and Simpleman laughs)''
'''Ladybug''': Oww! Boo-boo, Lucky Charm!
''(Cat Noir makes his stick taller but ends up falling down. The kids slap their faces with disappointment)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Candy! Simpleman! Candy for Miraculous! Everyone loves candy!
'''Simpleman''': Now that's a plan simple, efficient and easy to understand!
''(Simpleman looks around for candy and finds one place while Ladybug gets the ball)''
'''Simpleman''': Ladybug, Cat Noir? Let's stop fighting and make peace. Give me your miraculous and in exchange I'll give you some candy.
'''Ladybug''': Candy, I love candy!
'''Cat Noir''': Everyone loves candy!
''(They run to Simpleman but the kids stop them.)''
'''Manon''': No! Never take candy from a stranger!
'''Chris''': He's doing that to steal your miraculous!
'''Ladybug''': I'm tired of Miraculous! I don't want them anymore! ''(starts taking off her earings)''
'''Cat Noir''': Me neither! Superheroes are lame! ''(starts taking his ring off)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Oh, yes! Yes!
'''Ella, Etta, Manon, Chris''': NOOO!
''(Chris holds the lucky charm.)''
'''Chris''': You have to win against the bad guy!
'''Ella''': We don't want everyone to see weird like this.
'''Ladybug''': But the bad guy is too bad!
'''Cat Noir''': Look how strong he is!
'''Simpleman''': Ha! That's true!
''(Simpleman gets a back ache.)''
'''Etta''': Our sister always telling us that you're the strongest!
'''Ella''': And that you're smarter than the bad guys!
'''Ladybug''': Lucky Charm is too complicated.
'''Manon''': No, it's very simple! It's like a riddle. For example, you can take the air out of the ball and then use a pipe to attach it to the bicycle pump! And, and then you throw it under the bad guy's stick!
'''Ladybug''': Without air in it?
'''Etta''': A-and when the ball's under the stick you just have to blow it up again!
'''Ella''': And when the ball grows bigger it'll make the stick bounce!
'''Chris''': Then Cat Noir can catch it and cataclysm it!
'''Ladybug''': But I don't have a bicycle pump.
'''Cat Noir''': Can I just cataclysm the bad guy?
''(Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris groan. Simpleman starts thinking.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Hey! Explaining complicated stuff is cheating!
'''Simpleman''': You get there then. Sorry, but I'm gonna have to simplify you too kids! SIMPLIFICATION!
'''Chris''': ''(throws the ball)'' Ladybug!
'''Ladybug''': ''(catches the ball and thinks)'' Make it bounce! ''(throws it at Simpleman)''
'''Simpleman''': HEY!
'''Manon''': Cat Noir! ''(pointing at the peel)''
'''Cat Noir''': [[Cataclysm]]?!
''(Cat Noir destroys the peel.)''
'''Cat Noir''': It's true, my power ''is'' super simple!
'''Ladybug''': And repairing everything is even more simple! ''(Ladybug captures the akuma)'' Gotcha! ''(releases the purified akuma, fluttering away)'' Bye-bye, little butterfly. The only thing I have to say is...
'''Ladybug and the kids''': [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]!
''(Ladybug throws the ball up in the sky as the Miraculous Ladybug fixes everything.)''
'''Roger''': What are you doing in my car?
''(Simpleman turns back into Rolland.)''
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir''': Pound it!
''(Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris giggle and hug Ladybug and Cat Noir's legs.)''
'''Manon''': Ladybug, Cat Noir! You saved us!
'''Ladybug''': No, kids. You saved ''us.''
'''Cat Noir''': M'lady, to think we were this close to giving away our Miraculous... for candy?
'''Ladybug''': Of all the things we've faced, I never would've thought that such a simple power would be the most dangerous.
''(Ladybug creates a [[Magical Charms|Magical Charm]] and gives it to Rolland.)''
'''Ladybug''': Mr. Dupain, this magical charm will protect you from Shadow Moth.
'''Rolland''': Oh, is that so? How could this little thing protect me from Shadow-What's-His-Name? The world used to be so simple, I used to understand it! Now I don't understand anything anymore.
'''Chris''': You know, Grandpa Rolland, we don't understand everything either.
'''Etta''': But we are used to it.
'''Ella''': And what's cool is what we don't know, we can learn.
'''Manon''': It's funny it's kind of like a game that you have to win each time, but you're a grown-up and you're not used to it anymore, so it scares you.
'''Rolland''': You think I can still learn something at my age?
'''Etta''': Sure, if you want!

{{Scene|Scene: [[Eiffel Tower]]. Marinette is lowering the fishing rod.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': What am I doing, honestly? The truth is, I'm scared that Adrien will reject me if I tell him how I feel about him. That's why I over complicate everything, so that moment never comes. But whether my plan is complicated or simple, the result will be the same. So I might as well be simple and face my fear! I'm just gonna tell him that I love him quite simply.
'''Tikki''': Yes! Go on, Marinette! Be simple.
'''Marinette''': Adrien!
'''Adrien''': Marinette?
'''Marinette''': The ice cream umbrella like sewing perfume angels— ah! No! What I'm trying to say is that ice cream will eat your wings to sew them back up in a song— uhhh... Do you like fishing?
'''Adrien''': I don't know, I've never tried it.
'''Marinette''': Me neither! Well, I'm not gonna keep you any longer, okay? Now that you've got your wings back.
'''Vincent''': Action!

'''Rolland''': Go back way too early, sweetie? We haven't finished the movie yet!
'''Ella''': Quiet! It's the best part!
'''Marinette''': Superheroes love all that complicated stuff. Wouldn't you rather just watch a soccer game?
'''Rolland''': Plus not! It's actually quite simple. Come sit with us, we'll explain everything. So, look. This little guy in black is not a bad fellow. I think you know in red, well it's simple. Even when things are complicated, she never gives up! In fact, she reminds me of your grandmother when I first met her. I know it seems crazy, but she looks exactly like her! And all our ideas are kind of the same!
'''The kids''': Shhh!
