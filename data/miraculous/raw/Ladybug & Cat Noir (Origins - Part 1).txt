<poem>
'''[[Nooroo]]:''' Many centuries ago, magic jewels bestowing extraordinary powers were created. These were... the [[Miraculouses|Miraculous]]. Throughout history, heroes have used these jewels for the good of the human race. Two of these Miraculous are more powerful than the others; the [[Ladybug Miraculous|earrings of the Ladybug]], which provide the power of creation; and the [[Cat Miraculous|ring of the Black Cat]], which grants the power of destruction. According to legend, whoever controls both these jewels at the same time, will achieve absolute power.
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Male voice]]:''' I want that absolute power, Nooroo. I must have those Miraculous!
'''Nooroo:''' But nobody knows where these Miraculous are!
'''Male voice:''' I found you though, my little Nooroo. Your Miraculous... remind me of its powers again.
'''Nooroo:''' The Moth Brooch allows you to give someone their own superpowers and to make that person your devoted follower!
'''Gabriel:''' And when it comes to luring superheroes, what could be better than creating supervillains?
'''Nooroo:''' But master, the Miraculous are not meant to be used for evil purposes!
'''Male voice:''' I must have this absolute power! (Pointing at Nooroo) Your Miraculous is in my control! I am your master now, and you must obey me.
'''Nooroo:''' ''(sadly)'' Yes, master.
'''Male voice:''' ''(puts on the brooch)'' Nooroo, dark wings! Rise! ''(transforms into Hawk Moth)'' From this day on, I shall be known as... Hawk Moth! ''(laughs evilly)''

'''[[Wang Fu]]:''' Master, master... chanting, it's all part of the treatment. Master, master... ''(begins pushing customer out door) ''Thank you for coming, see you again next week!
'''Wayzz:''' Master, the [[Butterfly Miraculous|Moth Miraculous]], I felt its aura.
'''Wang Fu:''' I thought it had been lost forever!
'''Wayzz:''' But Master, it's a negative aura. I fear it may have gotten into the hands of a dark power!
'''Wang Fu:''' We must find Nooroo and his Miraculous. If it has gotten into the wrong hands, there's no telling what evil will come upon the world! ''(shows his Miraculous)'' Time to transform! Wayzz... ''(doubles over in pain)''
'''Wayzz:''' Please, Master. Be reasonable. You are–
'''Wang Fu:''' Still young! I'm only 186. But you're right, Wayzz. I can no longer do it alone. We'll need some help. ''(opens the gramophone, revealing the Miraculous chest box)''

'''Marinette: '''Dad, these are so awesome!

'''Wang Fu: '''Thank you, miss. Oh! What a disaster.
'''Marinette: '''''(People step on the spilled macarons)'' Don't worry, I'm no stranger to disasters, besides, there are still a few left.
'''Wang Fu: '''''(Grabs and eats one)'' Mmmh. Delicious!
'''Marinette: '''''(School bell rings)'' Oh no, I'm gonna be late! Ah, have a nice day, sir! ''(Runs towards the school)''

<poem>
'''[[Caline Bustier|Caline]]:''' Nino, Why don't you have a seat in the front row this year?
'''[[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]:''' Marinette Dupain-Cheng.
'''Marinette:''' Ugh. Here we go again.
'''Chloé:''' That's my seat.
'''Marinette:''' But Chloé, this has always been my seat.
'''[[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]]:''' Not anymore! New school, new year, new seats!
'''Chloé:''' So why don't you just go and sit beside that new girl over there? (points at Alya) Listen. Adrien's arriving today, and since that's going to be his seat, ''this'' is going to be ''my'' seat. Get it?
'''Marinette:''' Who's Adrien?
'''Chloé:''' ''(She and Sabrina laugh)'' Can you believe she doesn't know who Adrien is? What rock have you been living under?
'''Sabrina:''' He's only a famous model.
'''Chloé:''' And I am his best friend. He adores me. Go on, move!
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]:''' Hey! Who elected you Queen of Seats?
'''Chloé:''' Oh, Look Sabrina! We've got a little do-gooder in our class this year. What are you gonna do, super newbie? Shoot beams at me with your glasses?
'''Alya:''' Wouldn't you like to know. ''(walks away and grabs Marinette by the hand)'' Come on.
'''Marinette:''' ''(trips and falls, spilling all but one macaron)'' Sorry, sorry, sorry...
'''Miss Bustier:''' Has everyone found a seat?
'''Alya:''' Chillax, girl. No biggie.
'''Marinette:''' I so wish I can handle Chloé the way you do.
'''Alya:''' You mean the way Majestia does it. ''(Shows her a picture of Majestia on her phone)'' She says all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people do nothing. ''(pointing at Chloé)'' Well, that girl over there is evil, and we are the good people. We can't let her get away with it.
'''Marinette:''' Well, that's easier said than done. She likes to make my life miserable.
'''Alya:''' That's cause you let her, girl! You just need more confidence!
'''Marinette:''' ''(grabs a macaron from the box and gives half to Alya)'' Marinette.
'''Alya:''' Alya.
'''Miss Bustier:''' For those of you who don't yet know me, I'm Miss Bustier. I'll be your teacher this year.

'''Nathalie:''' Excellent, Adrien.
'''Gabriel:''' Give me a minute, would you, Nathalie?
'''Nathalie:''' Yes sir.
'''Gabriel:''' ''(To Adrien)'' You are NOT going to school. I already told you.
'''Adrien:''' But Father!
'''Gabriel:''' Everything you need is right here where I can keep an eye on you. I will not have you outside in that dangerous world.
'''Adrien:''' It's not dangerous, Father. I'm always stuck in here by myself. Why can't I go to school and make friends just like everyone else?
'''Gabriel:''' Because you are not like everyone else! You are my son! Continue.
'''Nathalie:''' We can leave it there for today if you have– ''(Adrien runs away)''

{{Scene|Scene: [[Adrien's room]]. Adrien is lying in bed when he hears some thumping, and goes outside to see the police about to fire at Stoneheart.}}
<poem>
'''[[Roger Raincomprix|Roger]]:''' Ready? Fire! ''(The police fires at Stoneheart, but he gets bigger.)''
''(Adrien turns on his TV)''
'''[[André Bourgeois|André]]:''' I'm asking all parisians to stay home until this situation is under control.
'''News Crews:''' Mr Bourgeois. Mr Bourgeois!

''(In Marinette's room, [[Tikki]] appears after the glow fades, causing Marinette to become terrified)'' 
'''Marinette:''' Ahh! Help! It's a giant bug! A... a mouse! A... a bug-mouse!

'''Marinette:''' Ahh! Bug mouse talks! ''(throws things at Tikki, which she dodges)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Plagg appears, to Adrien's astonishment. Plagg yawns.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' ''(is about to touch Plagg)'' No way... Like the genie in the lamp!
'''[[Plagg]]:''' ''(stops him)'' I met him once. So he grants wishes. Big deal! I'm way more personable! Plagg. Nice to meet you. Ooh, swanky... ''(flies off, touching random things)''
'''Adrien:''' No! Don't touch that! Come back here!
'''Plagg:''' Ooh! So shiny! Can you eat this? ''(tries to bite the game arcade's joystick)'' Argh, no, you can't! Ooh, what about this? ''(flies off)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. Marinette continues throwing things at Tikki until she finds a glass.}}
<poem>
'''Tikki:''' Listen, Marinette. I know everything may seem a bit strange to you... ''(Marinette traps her in the glass cup, making her voice muffled)'' Okay, if that makes you feel safer...
'''Marinette:''' What are you, and how do you know my name?
'''Tikki''': ''(muffled)'' I am a kwami, and my name is Tikki. Now just let me explain.
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Plagg tries to eat the remote controller. Meanwhile Adrien is climbing on his rock wall; when he gets to the highest point he jumps on Plagg, catching him; Plagg yells in surprise}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:'''  I still don't know what you're doing here.
'''Plagg:''' Look, I'm a kwami. I grant powers. Yours is the power of destruction, got it?
'''Adrien:''' ''(shakes head)'' Uh-uh.
'''Plagg:''' ''(starts looking around)'' Good. Now, you got anything to eat? I'm starving...
'''Adrien:''' ''(gets up while still holding Plagg)'' My dad's pranking me, right? Wait, he couldn't be. He has no sense of humor.
'''Plagg:''' ''(flies out of Adrien's hands)'' Your father must never know that I exist! Or anyone for that matter.
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. Marinette is attempting to open the trapdoor.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' Mom! Dad!
'''Tikki:''' No, no, no! ''(flies out of the glass)'' I'm your friend, Marinette! You must trust me. You're the only one who can stop Stoneheart!
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Fu's massage room. Wayzz still doubts the Chosen Ones are the right ones as Master Fu closes the Miracle Box in the gramophone.}}
<poem>
'''Wayzz:''' Do you think they'll be up to it, Master?
'''Wang Fu:''' I only got it wrong once. It will never happen again. At least I hope not. ''(Closes the box)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' This must be some mistake! The only superpower I could possibly have is super-awkwardness... I know! Alya would know! That's my friend. Well, at least I think she would... She loves superheroes! She'd totally be up for the job! You should totally go see her!
'''Tikki:''' Marinette, you are the chosen one! ''(Marinette is taken aback)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' But I'm stuck here! I'm never even let to go to school! What good is a superhero who's imprisoned in his own house!
'''Plagg:''' ''(rolling on top of a toilet paper roll)'' No good. That's why it's all going to change soon. If you're willing to change, that is. ''(Adrien looks at the ring)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. Marinette puts on the [[Ladybug Miraculous]].}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' Okay, so all I have to do is break the object where the whatchama-call-it is hiding?
'''Tikki:''' It's called an akuma. Which you must encapture.
'''Marinette:''' Got it! Capture it! And what's that charm thing again?
'''Tikki:''' The [[Lucky Charm]]! It's your secret superpower!
'''Marinette:''' Aww... this is all going too fast, Tikki... I... won't be able to pull this off!
'''Tikki:''' Trust yourself, Marinette. Just say "Spots on".
<center>'''''[ Transformation Sequence ]'''''</center>
<center>'''Marinette:''' Spots on? ''(The earrings activate)'' Whoa! What is happening?! ''(Marinette transforms into Ladybug for the first time)''</center>
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Adrien puts on the [[Cat Miraculous]].}}
<poem>
'''Plagg:''' Claws out! That's how you transform.
'''Adrien:''' Got it. Plagg, claws out!
'''Plagg:''' No, wait! I haven't finished explaining!--- ''(enters the ring)''
<center>'''''[ Transformation Sequence ]'''''</center>

'''Cat Noir:''' Too cool!
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. Marinette, now as Ladybug, is still confused with her suit.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug:''' Aww... how does this thing come off? Tikki, if you can hear me, I want my normal clothes back. I'm not going anywhere! ''(sees the screen)''
'''Nadja''': Stoneheart is heading toward the Montparnasse tower. The monster seems to be unstoppable!
'''Ladybug:''' ''(sees Alya going after Stoneheart and gasps)'' Alya?
'''Sabine:''' Marinette! Did you get home okay?
'''Ladybug:''' Uhh... yeah, Mom! Just super! ''(goes upstairs)''
'''Sabine:''' Marinette? You in here? Tom, we better call the school.
''(In [[Marinette's balcony]])''
'''Ladybug:''' Okay, I have special powers!... and apparently this amazing super yo-yo thingy? ''(grasps the yo-yo to a gargoyle statue. She pulls the yo-yo and it whisks her to the other side)''
''(In the streets)''
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(while tightrope walking over his stick)'' I'm starting to get the hang of this. 
''(He then sees Ladybug about to fall. She falls in his arms. They both fall and get hung by the yo-yo.)'' 
'''Cat Noir:''' Well, hey there. Nice of you to drop in.
'''Ladybug:''' Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't do it on purpose.
'''Cat Noir:''' I bet you're the partner my kwami told me about. I'm... Cat Noir. Yeah, Cat Noir. And you?
'''Ladybug:''' I'm Ma... err... Mar... uhh... ''(pulls the yo-yo and it hits Cat Noir)'' Madly Clumsy. I'm so clumsy.
'''Cat Noir:''' No sweat, clumsy girl. I'm learning the ropes too.
''(Suddenly, the floor trembles. Cat Noir sees a building falling and goes to where it is)''
'''Ladybug:''' Hey! Where are you going?
'''Cat Noir:''' To save Paris, right?
'''Ladybug:''' Ugh. ''(to herself)'' Trust yourself, trust yourself... ''(uses the yo-yo to swing around and follow Cat Noir)''
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Parc des Princes. The students are done with P.E. But then Stoneheart appears.}}
<poem>
'''Stoneheart:''' KIMMM!! So, who's wuss now?
''(Kim runs away from the monster, but he trips and falls.)''
'''Cat Noir:''' Hey, it's not very nice to pick on people who are smaller than you.
'''Stoneheart:''' I guess you're talking about yourself.
'''Hawk Moth:''' Everything's going to plan. Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous have been activated. Here they come to save the day, and now my supervillain will destroy them.
''(Cat Noir hits Stoneheart with his stick, but he gets bigger)''
'''Cat Noir:''' Where are you, partner?
'''Ladybug;''' Oh, I can't. I'm not gonna be able to do it... ''(Stoneheart throws a net away. The net is about to hit Alya but Cat Noir saves her.)''
'''Alya:''' What are you waiting for, super red bug? The world is watching you!
''(Ladybug suddenly is filled with courage. as her heartbeat was heard offscreen. She enters the stadium and is about to fight Stoneheart.)''
'''Ladybug:''' Animal cruelty? How shameful!
'''Alya:''' Yes!
'''Ladybug:''' Sorry it took so long, Cat Noir.
'''Cat Noir:''' It's cool, Wonderbug. Now, let's kick his rocky behind!
'''Ladybug:''' Wait! Haven't you noticed? He gets bigger and stronger with every attack. We have to do something different.
'''Cat Noir:''' Different how?
'''Ladybug:''' Uhhh... I don't know.
'''Cat Noir:''' Okay then. Let's use our powers. [[Cataclysm]]! Apparently I destroy whatever I touch.
'''Ladybug:''' I don't need a superpower to destroy everything.
'''Cat Noir:''' ''(uses his Cataclysm to break the net)''
'''Ladybug:''' No, don't do that!
'''Cat Noir:''' Cool. It's just you and me now! Time to rumble, soon-to-be rubble!
'''Ladybug:''' Cat Noir! Wait!
''(Cat Noir leaps towards Stoneheart to try and defeat him, but realizes his power is not activated.)''
'''Cat Noir:''' Uh-oh. I guess I only get one shot to use my power. ''(waves sheepishly; Stoneheart kicks him away)''
'''Ladybug:''' And you only have five minutes before you transform back. Didn't your kwami explain anything to you?
'''Cat Noir:''' I guess I was a little excited about my new life.
'''Ladybug:''' Well, up to me. Lucky Charm! ''(A [[List of Lucky Charm objects|suit]] appears)''
'''Cat Noir''': Super power?
'''Ladybug:''' My kwami told me I have to break the object where the whatchama-call-it... er, the akuma is hiding.
'''Cat Noir:''' Well, he's made entirely out of stone.
'''Ladybug:''' His right hand, it's still closed. He never opens it. It's like the Russian dolls. The object isn't on him, it's hidden in his fist!
'''Cat Noir:''' So what's your plan?
'''Ladybug:''' Hmmm... ''(Looking around, she spots a hose, Alya and the wetsuit)'' This! ''(grabs the hose and ties it to the suit. Then ties Cat Noir's feet with her yo-yo.)'' Don't resist. Trust me.
'''Cat Noir:''' This girl's crazy! ''(gets thrown and Stoneheart gets him)''
'''Ladybug:''' Catch me if you can! ''(Stoneheart drops the akumatized object and grabs Ladybug.)'' 
'''Ladybug:''' And now... Alya, the tap! 
''(Alya goes to the water tap and opens it. The water sprouts and inflates the suit. Stoneheart lets go of her. Ladybug breaks the akumatized object and the Akuma flies away. Stoneheart is turned back into Ivan.)''
'''Cat Noir:''' This girl is awesome. She's crazy awesome.
'''Ivan:''' What's going on? What am I doing here?
'''Cat Noir:''' You were incredible, miss... uh... Bug lady. You did it!
'''Ladybug:''' We both did it, partner.
'''Ladybug & Cat Noir:''' Pound it! ''(Cat Noir's Miraculous beeps)''
'''Ladybug:''' You should get going. Our identities must remain secret.
'''Cat Noir:''' Farewell, m'lady. Let's do this again soon, okay?
'''Ladybug:''' Not too soon, I hope. ''(sees Ivan, grabs the paper and reads it)'' "You haven't even got the guts to tell Mylène you love her, wuss." Aw...
'''Ivan:''' Kim wrote it. He's always making fun of me.
'''Ladybug:''' You know, you shouldn't get so bent out of shape about that. There's no shame in telling someone you love them, Ivan.
'''Ivan:''' Hey, how did you know my name, miss?
'''Ladybug:''' Uh...
'''Alya:''' Uncanny, amazing, spectacular! Are you gonna be protecting Paris from now on? How did you get your powers? Did you get stung by a radioactive Ladybug? Oh, I've got a ton of questions to ask you, uh, miss... uhh...
'''Ladybug:''' Uhh... Ladybug! Call me Ladybug.
'''Alya:''' Ladybug... Super awesome!
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Marinette's room. Marinette is watching the news from her computer, feeling proud.}}
<poem>
'''Nadja:''' So thanks to this amateur footage, the Parisians now know the identities of their heroes!
'''Marinette:''' I did it, Tikki!
'''Tikki:''' You see? You were up to it!
'''Sabine:''' ''(voice)'' Marinette! Dinner time!
'''Mr. Bourgeois:''' I am pleased to announce that we will organize a huge celebration in honor of our city's new protectors. Ladybug and Cat Noir.
'''Adrien:''' Ladybug. Her name is Ladybug...
'''Plagg:''' Eww, what is this?
'''Adrien:''' Seriously? My personal chef made all this!
'''Plagg:''' If you expect me to get my energy back after the transformation, i need to eat something more... delicate!
'''Adrien:''' Okay. What do you want?
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Eiffel Tower. The released akuma steps on top of a pole and it multiplies.}}

{{Scene|Scene: Bakery. Marinette was washing the dishes when she hears her mother watching the TV}}
<poem>
'''Sabine:''' ''(voice)'' Oh my!
'''Marinette:''' Hmmm?
'''Nadja:''' Just as Paris is about to celebrate the appearance of our two new superheroes, Ladybug and Cat Noir, a new wave of panic is sweeping across the capital as dozens of people are mysteriously transformed into stone monsters. It's simply unbelievable.
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Adrien's room. Adrien looks exasperated while he watches Plagg eating Camembert.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien:''' Camembert cheese. Fantastic. All he eats is Camembert, which means I'm gonna smell like stinky old cheese.
'''Nadja:''' These victims transformed into stone beings are still like statues. The police are perplexed to what will happen to them. Will they come back to life or be frozen in time forever?
'''Adrien:''' Plagg? What's going on? I thought we defeated him.
'''Tikki;''' ''(simultaneously; with Plagg)'' Did you capture the akuma?
'''Marinette:''' What's capturing the akuma got to do with the other stone beings?
'''Tikki:''' An akuma can multiply, that's why it must be captured. If Ivan's emotions become negative again, then the akuma will turn him back into Stoneheart! He'll control all the stone beings and bring them to life to serve as his army!
'''Marinette:''' So that means... this is all my fault? I knew it! See, Tikki? I'm not cut out to be a superhero! I'm only gonna keep messing up.
'''Tikki:''' Keep calm. It was your first time. You're going to go back and capture Stoneheart's akuma, and do it successfully!
'''Marinette:''' I can't! I told you, I'm clumsy! I create disaster all the time! I'll only make things worse for me, for you and for everyone. Cat Noir will be better off without me. I'm quitting.
'''Adrien:''' SO I can't do anything without Ladybug?
'''Plagg:''' Only Ladybug can capture akumas and repair damage caused by supervillains.
'''Marinette:''' If Cat Noir can't capture the akumas, then... just find another Ladybug. I told you, I'm not cut out to be Ladybug! ''(takes her earrings off)'' I'm sorry Tikki.
'''Tikki:''' No, don't do tha--
'''Marinette:''' ...Tikki? ''(puts the earrings back in the box and puts the box in the drawer)'' I'm really sorry, Tikki...
</poem>

{{Scene|Scene: Hawk Moth's lair.}}
<poem>
'''Hawk Moth:''' Ivan has a sensitive heart. It won't be long before anger and sadness strike again. And he and the stone beings will come alive. Then we'll see how long you will remain hidden, Ladybug and Cat Noir. Once I have your Miraculous, you will be powerless against me. ''(Shows Ivan sitting on the stairs while listening to music, Adrien is sitting on his couch while he worries while Plagg is in front of him, Marinette regrets her decisions in front of her vanity)'' Everyone will be powerless against me! ''(Hawk Moth cackles as his window closes)''. I will have absolute power! Mwahahahaha!
