{{Scene|Scene: [[Miss Bustier's classroom]]. [[Caline Bustier]] is teaching her class. [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] stares dreamily at [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]], who is talking to his best friend [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]]. [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] writes a love note and hands it to Nino. [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Nathaniel]] is drawing on his tablet, and [[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]] explains something to [[Alix Kubdel|Alix]]. All is well until [[Rose Lavillant|Rose]] gets a headache, worrying [[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]].}}
<poem>
'''Rose:''' ''(groans and puts hand on head)'' Miss Bustier, may I go to the nurse's office? Miss Heady is back.
'''Miss Bustier:''' Well we can't let Miss Heady unattended. Marinette, would you please accompany Rose to the nurse's office? ''(Marinette fails to pay attention as she is still staring at Adrien)'' Marinette?
'''Marinette:''' ''(snaps out of it)'' Wah! Yes, of course. ''(walks out of classroom with Rose)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] courtyard. Marinette and Rose are walking to the nurse's office.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' So who's this Miss Heady? An imaginary friend like Unicorn Lilly you had in sixth grade?
'''Rose:''' ''(laughs)'' No, uh, Heady is just a nickname I have for my headache when she pays me a little visit. That'll teach me to leave the house without Mr. Brekkie. ''(Marinette looks confused)'' Wakie Wakie, I'm Mr. Brekkie, the big breakfast to keep you healthy!
'''Marinette:''' ''(laughs)'' I love how you see the world through rose-colored glasses. And come back as soon as you can. Say hi to Sissy for me!
'''Rose:''' Sissy?
'''Marinette:''' ''(shows Rose the nurse's office)'' Nurse Sissy's office!
'''Rose:''' ''(laughs)'' Don't worry Marinette. Sissy never keeps me long. ''(Rose enters the nurse's office and Marinette walks back to class)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Miss Bustier's classroom.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' ''(opens door and walks inside)'' Everything's okay, Rose just missed breakfast is all. 
''(Juleka still seems concerned)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Cafeteria]] at Collège Françoise Dupont. Juleka is happily eating lunch alone. She gets a message from Rose on her phone, and is instantly distressed upon seeing it, and pushes away her food tray.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' ''(walking by and seeing Juleka)'' Juleka, if you skip Mr. Mealy, your big, tasty energy packed lunch, Heady might pay you a visit too!
''(Juleka cries and runs away)''
'''Marinette:''' Juleka! Uh, I was just trying to make a joke! Uh, no, Juleka!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Courtyard at Collège Françoise Dupont. Juleka runs into the [[Boiler room|boiler room]] as Marinette looks around for her.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' Juleka!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Boiler room. Juleka sits on the floor and continues to cry.}}
{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair]]. Window opens.}}
<poem>
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]]:''' Oh, how well I know that feeling of loneliness. The intense anxiety that no one else can share. And that only an [[akuma]] can ease. ''(creates akuma)'' Fly, and evilize that lonely heart!
''(An akuma flies out of the window and across the skies of [[Paris]].)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Courtyard at Collège Françoise Dupont. Adrien is brought back to school as Marinette continues to look for Juleka.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' Juleka! ''(bumps into Adrien)'' Uh! ''(groans, and sees Adrien and immediately becomes flattered)'' Oh, excuse you Adrien, I didn't mean to crush on you- uh, I mean, ''crash'' into you! ''(to herself)'' Ugh, Marinette, this is no time for nonsense! ''(back to Adrien)'' I'm looking for Juleka, she ran out the cafeteria in tears, and...
'''Adrien:''' Maybe she's in there. ''(points to the door to the ominous boiler room)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Boiler room. Marinette and Adrien enter but Marinette suddenly trips on the stairs and falls onto Adrien.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' Aaah!
'''Adrien:''' Oh! ''(Adrien stares at Marinette, and then smiles)''
'''Marinette:''' ''(backs away)'' Uh, sorry! I'm just so lovesick- I mean, uh- ''worried sick'' for Juleka. That's why I'm so flustered and clumsy and...  oh, I'm such a fool! I don't know if I said something to upset her earlier.
'''Adrien:''' The things you say don't always make a lot of sense, Marinette, but they're never mean. There's got to be some other reason. Come on, let's find her.
''(Marinette and Adrien walk towards a corner and hear crying. They hide behind a wall.)''
'''Adrien:''' ''(to Marinette)'' Stay back, and not a sound, okay? I'll handle it. ''(walks towards Juleka and kneels to her)'' Juleka? Is everything okay?
'''Juleka:''' ''(sobs)'' I just want to be alone.
'''Adrien:''' You want to be alone, I understand. 
''(Marinette texts everyone; Adrien notices)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Cafeteria]] at Collège Francois Dupaint. Everyone sees what Marinette texted.}}
<poem>
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]:''' It's okay!
'''[[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]]:''' They found Juleka!
'''[[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]]:''' She's in the boiler room.
''(Everyone is shocked)''
'''All:''' ''The boiler room?!''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Back at the Boiler Room. Marinette walks over to Adrien and Juleka}}
<poem>
'''Marinette:''' I'm so sorry. I really am the worst class rep ever. But I don't get it, did I say something that upset you? ''(Juleka looks up; her face in tears)''
'''Juleka:''' It's not you, it's Rose... ''(continues crying)''
'''Marinette:''' What do you mean Rose?
'''Juleka:''' ''(tearfully)'' I'm worried about her...
'''Marinette:''' Uh, no. Don't worry, she's fine. She's just resting in the nurse's office. Juleka, you know you can tell us anything. We're your friends, I promise we won't tell anyone else.
''(Juleka displays her phone. It shows a photo of Rose in a bed at the hospital with cheerful emojis. She continues crying.)''
'''Marinette:''' Rose... ''isn't'' in the nurse's office..?
''(Most of the other students in [[Miss Bustier's class]] appear)''
'''Everyone:''' She's ''in the hospital?!''
'''Juleka:''' ''(sobbing)'' Yes, she is...
''(Alya walks over to them)''
'''Alya:''' Why is she in the hospital? ''(The whole class is looking pitifully at Juleka)''
'''Juleka:''' She got sick when she was a little girl...
''(Everyone is shocked and gasps)''
'''Mylène:''' She was sick when she was little?
'''[[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]]:''' But it's over now, right?
'''Juleka''': It can come back anytime...
'''[[Alix Kubdel|Alix]]:''' It can come back anytime?
'''Nino:''' But she's always so cheerful! We would have never guessed...
'''Juleka:''' She made me promise not to tell you guys...
'''Marinette:''' ''(guiltily)'' Oh, she made you promise not to tell us.
'''Juleka:''' Please don't tell her I said anything about it..
'''Adrien:''' Don't worry Juleka, we're not going to treat her differently or anything like that.
'''Marinette:''' Rose will never know that you told us.
'''[[Markov]]:''' I'm reprogramming my conversational software as we speak in order to avoid any future reference to this unfortunate anecdote.
'''[[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]]:''' Even if I get bitten by a zombie-dolphin, who takes control of my brain, I won't say a thing. ''(zips his mouth)'' Never ever.
''(Adrien helps Juleka get up)''
'''Adrien:''' Don't feel bad about telling us, Juleka. You hung on to that secret as long as you could, but it was just too heavy to bear alone.
'''Juleka:''' ''(smiling)'' Thank you.
'''Marinette:''' That's what friends are for.
'''Adrien:''' Rose trusts you and you can trust us. We won't say anything, but now we see what you're going through. And we can help you if you need.
''(Everyone hugs Juleka as the akuma flies away from them)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Shadow Moth's lair}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth:''' Impossible! How could such an abyss of loneliness and despair simply vanish?! 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Métro entrance. Juleka is waiting for Rose and she appears walking up the stairs. Juleka smiles.}}
<poem>
'''Rose:'''  ''(waves)'' Good morning! ''(Juleka sees Rose and hugs her.)'' I told you everything was alright. 
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Entrance of Collège Françoise Dupont. Rose and Juleka walk up the steps and Adrien hurriedly greets them.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': Hi Juleka! Hi Rose!
'''Juleka & Rose:''' Hi!
''(Marinette walks past)''
'''Marinette:''' Hi there, girls!
'''Juleka & Rose:''' Hi!
''(Marinette suddenly stops)''
'''Marinette:''' Oh! ''(hugs Rose)'' I love you, Rose! I don't say it enough.
'''Rose:''' I.. I love you too, Marinette.
''(Mylène walks past)''
'''Mylène:''' Rose, you're our sunshine here at school.
''(The rest of her friends appear)''
'''Markov:''' The student population's good mood rises 95 percent in your presence.
'''Max:''' ''(displaying his phone)'' Correct, Markov.
'''Nino:''' You're the soundtrack that puts the happy into our mixtape of life.
''(Juleka looks nervous)''
'''Rose:''' You guys mean so much to me too. And you're right, we never say it to each other enough. Oh, what an awesome way to start the day. 
''(Seeing Rose is cheerful, Juleka feels relieved.)'''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Miss Bustier's classroom]].}}
<poem>
''(Just as Rose enters, Kim grabs her briefcase)''
'''Rose:''' Thank you, but it's not that heavy, you know.
'''Kim:''' Uhh.. carrying your bags helps me build my muscles.
''(Rose giggles and Juleka begins feeling guilty and irritated)'''
'''Rose:''' ''(heading to her seat, Marinette places a pillow on her seat.)'' Thank you.
'''Marinette:''' These chairs are so uncomfortable. ''(taps the chair)'' But I decided to make one of these for everyone and lucky you, you just happen to be the first one to get one.
'''Rose:''' Uhm.. Thank you?
''(Markov grabs Rose's notebook)''
'''Markov:''' Don't worry. I shall transcribe all the classes for you this year, so you no longer tire yourself.
'''Rose:''' Thank you, but I actually like writing my own notes for class.
''(Markov leaves and Rose looks at Juleka.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene:The cafeteria. As Marinette gets her next food, she let Rose and Juleka pass through first.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Oh, you guys can go ahead of me.
'''Kim''': Let Rose through. Everyone out of the way and let Rose through. ''(Juleka becomes suspicious)'' Uh, because it would make me very happy?
''(While Juleka and Rose are eating, Marinette gives Rose an apple. Then Alya, Nino, Max & Markov, Kim and Ivan follow. Rose sees Juleka feeling quite uncomfortable.)''
'''Rose''': I get the feeling you need to tell me something. Am I right? 
'''Juleka''': Um.... 
'''Rose''': Come with me.
''(Rose pulls Juleka towards the girls' bathroom.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The bathroom. Both Juleka and Rose are in a comfort room.}}
<poem>
'''Juleka''': ''(sadly)'' I told them about you...
'''Rose''': You.. ''told them?...'' Oh no.. they'll never act normal around me ever again! 
''(Juleka become more saddened and Rose lends her hands.)''
'''Rose''': No, Jule. this is all my fault. I should never have told you my secret. I make you worry about me all of the time. 
''(Rose begins to smile)'' 
'''Rose''': Hey. You know what? No big deal. I'm going to take care of this I should have told them all about it a long time ago. I'll just explain everything and it'll all go back to the way it was.
''(Rose leaves the comfort room and Juleka smiles.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outside the bathroom. Most of Rose's classmates are leaning close towards the door. When Rose herself opens the door, everyone is pushed back.}}
<poem>
'''Max''': We were worried! You've been in there, four minutes and 47 seconds when people usually spend an average of three minutes and 24 seconds in the bathroom.
'''Ivan''': Well, I was about to tear the door off its hinges.
'''Kim''': I was ready to dive in and save you.
''(Rose sighs)''
'''Rose''': I see how worried I've made you. Please forgive me, if I never told you about my illness before now, it's because it's not my problems that matter but the way I get through them that counts. And how do I get through them each day?
'''Marinette''': By giving them all cute little nicknames. ''(Displays all emoji signs of themselves)''
'''Alya''': By always being supreme. ''(Displays a scene of her and Prince Ali giving donations)''
'''Ivan''': By always singing, just a bit too loud. ''(Displays a scene of her singing)''
'''Rose''': Exactly. And I always want to be that Rose, I don't want you to see me any differently. I want you to just be my friends who laugh and have a great time with me. Not ones who carry my book, bag or embroidered cushions or worry every time I go to the bathroom. ''(Rose holds Juleka)'' I don't want you to feel sorry for me because no one is happier than I am. Okay?
'''Marinette''': No more embroidered cushions I promise.
'''Kim''': No more book-bag muscle building.
'''Alix''': And no more extraneous displays of affection.
'''Rose''': Oh well, I kind of like the display of affection. ''(giggles)''
''(Everyone hugs Rose and Rose whispers to Juleka)''
'''Rose''': See, I told you everything would be all right.
''(Juleka smiles)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Ms. Mendeleiev's classroom]].}}
<poem>
'''[[Ms. Mendeleiev]]''': Today, we're going to study viruses, germs, bacteria, and all the terrible illnesses that are caused by them.
''(Rose abruptly sneezes and everyone panics)''
'''Marinette''': ''(panicking)'' Quick! Call her parents, hurry up! ''(place a blanket on Rose)'' Put these on. 
''(Mylène places the tissues)''
'''Alya''': ''(rings her phone)'' I can't get hold of her parents!
'''Marinette''': Nino, call an ambulance! ''(pops up his phone)''
'''Adrien''': ''(confused)'' Marinette?
'''Marinette''': Alix, call the fire department!
'''Nino''': They're not answering!
''(Alya attempts to call Rose's parents)''
'''Rose''': ''(screaming)'' STOP IT! 
''(The entire class falls into a deafening silence.)''
'''Rose''': ''(disappointed)'' You guys promised. 
''(Juleka begins to feel upset and guilty)''
'''Juleka''': I'm sorry...
''(Juleka leaves the classroom and Rose follows her)''
'''Rose''': Oh no... Juleka, wait!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Shadow Moth's lair.}}
<poem>
'''Shadow Moth''': Even stronger than a painful secret and more painful than the anguish of solitude, is the guilt of the girl who betrayed her dearest friend. It digs a bottomless pit into her heart. Fly away my little akuma and take this [[amok]] with you! ''(releases an akuma and an amok)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Bathroom. Juleka runs into a stall, and closes it shut.}}
<poem>
'''Rose''': Juleka. ''(she knocks)'' Juleka, I'm sorry. This is all my fault. Open up.
''(Juleka turns on her phone and reads the mountains of tweets her classmates have started to send to her)''
'''Marinette''': ''(in a group conversation)'' This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.
'''Juleka''': Everyone feels guilty because of me. ''(swipes her phone screen, which displays her friends conversation with countless emojis)''
'''Rose''': Oh no, Juleka. No one feels guilty because of you.
''(Rose sees an akuma and an amok)''
'''Rose''': Juleka! Juleka, talk to me! Juleka!
''(The amok enters her phone and the akuma enters her hand glove)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Reflekta, I am Shadow Moth. Why let yourself be eaten up by such intense feelings of guilt, when you can turn them against all of those who didn't keep their words?
'''Rose''': Jule, please resist. Don't listen to him!
''(Juleka transforms into Relekta)''
'''Rose''': Hang on, I'll be right back! ''(leaves the bathroom)''
''([[Guiltrip (sentimonster)|Guiltrip]] also summons in front of Reflekta on the stall door.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Your sentimonster,  Guiltrip, is perfect. All who have broken promises and are ruining your friend's life will take the guilt trip of a lifetime.
'''Reflekta''': The first to plead guilty, is me.
''(Reflekta throws the phone into the trash can and allows herself to get sucked into Guiltrip)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(horrified)'' No! Wait!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Ms. Mendeleiev's classroom]]. Rose opens the door.}}
<poem>
'''Rose''': Juleka is about to be transformed into a villain. Somebody help!
'''Ms. Mendeleiev''': I am a science teacher, not a superhero. Everyone just remain seated and... ''(shocked)''
''(All of the students, except for [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]], [[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]] and [[Lila Rossi|Lila]], leave the classroom.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The changing rooms. Adrien goes into to the male bathroom and Marinette goes inside a locker.}}
<poem>
'''Adrien''': Plagg, claws out! ''(Transforms into Cat Noir and comes out)''
'''Marinette''': Tikki, spots on! ''(Transforms into Ladybug and comes out)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: The girls bathroom. Ivan pulls the door open and all the students see Guiltrip.}}
<poem>
'''Alya''': What on earth is that?
''(Everybody, except for Rose and Kim gets sucked into Guiltrip and screams)''
'''Kim''': I'll save you! ''(dives into Guiltrip)''
'''Ms. Mendeleiev''': Everybody back to class! ''(gets sucked into Guiltrip and screams)''
'''Rose''': Don't worry Juleka! I'm going to save you! ''(Tries diving into the Guiltrip but Ladybug stops her with her [[Yo-yo|yo-yo]])''
'''Ladybug''': Hang on! We're gonna get you somewhere safe!
'''Rose''': My friend Juleka is in there and I'm not gonna leave her all alone! ''(untangles Ladybug's yo-yo and dives inside Guiltrip)''
'''Ladybug''': No! ''(to Cat Noir)'' Looks like we're gonna do a little cave exploration, hang on tight. ''(Ladybug ties her yoyo to Cat Noir's staff as a grappling rope as they enter Guiltrip)''
''(Upon entering inside Guiltrip, they are losing their grip along with their weapons)''
'''Ladybug''': The airflow is too strong! I can't hold back anymore!
''(The barrier cracks and the heroes fall into Guiltrip, screaming)''
'''Shadow Moth''': Yes! Ladybug, Cat Noir, you just go headfirst into my trap and you'll never escape from it! Your Miraculous are mine!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Inside of Guiltrip.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug & Cat Noir''': Ahhhhhhhhhhh! ''(They stop falling and start floating)''
'''Cat Noir''': Wow, it's way cooler in here than on the outside.
'''Ladybug''': I don't know. I have a strange feeling.
''(A bubble pops out)''
'''Cat Noir''': Look out! ''(Pops the bubble)''
''(Multiple bubbles pop out and Ladybug and Cat Noir destroy them)''
'''Cat Noir''': It's like being inside a giant pinball machine.
'''Ladybug''': Yeah. But I think it's in multi-ball mode.
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir head deeper as they saw Ivan.)''
'''Ivan''': ''(bubbles absorbing him)'' Everyone got captured because of me. Everyone got captured because of me.
'''Cat Noir''': What's wrong with him?
'''Ivan''': Everyone got captured because of me. ''(The bubbles absorb him and turn into a clone of Reflekta)''
'''Cat Noir''': Is it me or did he just turn into Reflekta?
'''Ladybug''': She must have been re-akumatized by Shadow Moth. And that thing...
'''Cat Noir''': ...is her sentimonster!
'''Ladybug''': We've got to find out where Reflekta is hiding, she must be the one controlling it. Stay on your guard.
''(Ladybug and Cat Noir head deeper)''
'''Ms. Mendeleiev''': I never should have let them leave the classroom. I never should have let them leave the classroom. ''(The bubbles absorb her and turn into a clone of Reflekta)''
'''Ladybug''': The sentimonster is contaminating everyone with these purple balls.
'''Cat Noir''': It's not gonna be easy finding the real Reflekta with everyone looking like her.
'''Kim''': ''(as a clone of Reflekta)'' If only I had worn my competition swimsuit, I would have been faster.
'''Mylène''': ''(as a clone of Reflekta)'' I never should have let go of Ivan's hand.
'''Ladybug''': They all look the same, but they still have their own voices.
''(Cat Noir stops upon hearing Nino)''
'''Nino''': ''(as a clone of Reflekta)'' I can't even help my best bud face up to his old man...
'''Cat Noir''': ''(saddened; guiltily)'' Oh, Nino... ''(He starts to feel guilty and a bubble pops out)'' This is all our fault. ''(multiple bubbles start to absorb him; Ladybug looks back and notices)'' If we've been able to stop Shadow Moth, the students wouldn't be caught in this trap.
'''Ladybug''': Oh no, this can't be happening! Not now!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(sighs sadly)'' [[Cataclysm]]. ''(attempts to use it on himself but Ladybug stops him)''
'''Ladybug''': Cat Noir, no! We could turn into Reflekta and frozen like the rest of them, Shadow Moth will help himself to our Miraculous!
'''Cat Noir''': We should just give him our Miraculous.
''(Ladybug starts to feel guilty as well; bubbles start to absorb her and Cat Noir)''
'''Ladybug''': You're right, kitty cat. How could I ever believe that the two of us could take on such a powerful [[Sentimonster|sentimonster]] by ourselves?
''(Rose comes out and finds Ladybug and Cat Noir within her sight, to her joy.)''
'''Rose''': ''(gasps)'' Ladybug, Cat Noir, you guys are totally the best! I knew you'd come to save us! ''(stop and sees the heroes feeling sad)'' I'm sorry you had to come. It's all my fault, I'm not a good friend. I should have never told Juleka my secrets.
''(Bubbles approach Rose.)''
'''Rose''': ''(in her mind)'' No, I must not be like that. Yes, I'm glad I did! That's what made us closer and stronger! ''(She resists the bubbles)'' Yes!
'''Ladybug''': ''(smiling)'' Of course, she's fighting her negative thoughts with positive thinking! That's what stops her from turning into Reflekta! We have to do the same. Cat Noir you can do this, you have to think positive, you're the greatest partner anyone could have!
'''Cat Noir''': Ladybug, do you really mean that?
'''Ladybug''': Yes, I probably don't tell you this enough, but I couldn't do this without you. And it'd be a lot less fun too.
''(Cat Noir smiles)''
'''Cat Noir''': Why, that's a ''meowvulous'' thing to say! ''(floats towards Ladybug)'' And you're just about ''purr-fect'' yourself, m'lady.
'''Ladybug''': ''(laughs and playfully shoves him)'' Nice to have you back, kitty cat.
'''Cat Noir''': ''(Removes the bubble on his hand)'' You really think that we'll be able to get out of this one huh?
'''Ladybug''': Of course don't forget that I still have my.. [[Lucky Charm]]! 
''(She activates her Lucky Charm and summons an ice axe (pickaxe), to her confusion)''
'''Ladybug''': Oh yeah, an ice axe of course, an ice axe to uh... ''(Ladybug looks around but struggles to come up with a plan to use it)''
''(Bubbles pop out and start to aim at the heroes again)''
'''Cat Noir''': You don't know what to do with it? ''(Pops bubbles)''
'''Ladybug''': Of course I do. I'm just keeping you in suspense.
'''Cat Noir''': ''(getting despondent)'' I could try using my cataclysm, but sending a sentimonster out of control when you're inside the sentimonster... probably isn't the best idea, huh?
'''Ladybug''': Nope, it's not. ''(stressed; groans)'' All this negativity is messing with my brain, ugh!
'''Rose''': ''(cheering for Ladybug and Cat Noir)'' Go Ladybug! Go Cat Noir! You're the best! You're gonna save my friend Juleka, because I totally believe in you.
'''Ladybug''': Yes, but we need more positivity to do that. ''(gasps and looks at Rose)'' And I know just the person who can help us.
''(Ladybug opens her yo-yo and releases the [[Pig Miraculous]])''
'''Ladybug''': Rose Lavillant, here is the Miraculous of the Pig, which grants the power of jubilation. You will use it for the greater good.
'''Rose''': Wow, it's so.. beautiful. ''(She takes the pearl anklet in her hands and [[Daizzi]] is released)''
'''Rose & Daizzi''': Wow, you're so cute!
'''Rose''': What's your name? 
'''Daizzi''': My name's Daizzi, and I'm your kwami. 
'''Ladybug''': They'll give you your powers. You just have to recite these words: "Daizzi, Rejoice."
<div><center>'''''[Transformation Sequence]'''''<br />'''Rose''': Daizzi, Rejoice!<br />''(Rose transforms into Pigella)''</center></div>
'''Ladybug''': Cat Noir, may I introduce- um?
'''Pigella''': ''(swings her [[Tambourine|tambourine]])'' Pigella!
'''Cat Noir''': ''(smiles)'' Wow! Looks like you found a solution, m'lady.
'''Ladybug''': I told you, think positive.
'''Cat Noir''': I can't wait to see our new friend in action. 
'''Ladybug''': Come on, let's go.
''(Ladybug, Cat Noir and Pigella dive deeper into Guiltrip and they find the real Reflekta surrounded by bubbles and feeling immensely guilty, with only her face being seen)''
'''Reflekta''': Because of me, everyone feels guilty. Rose, Marinette, Adrien, Ivan, Mylène. Because of me, everyone feels guilty. Rose, Marinette, Adrien, Ivan, Mylène. Because of me, everyone feels guilty. 
'''Ladybug''': Juleka!
'''Reflekta''': Rose, Marinette, Adrien, Ivan, Mylène.
''(Pigella approaches Reflekta.)''
'''Reflekta''': Because of me, everyone feels guilty. Rose, Marinette, Adrien, Ivan, Mylène. Because of me, everyone feels guilty. Rose, Marinette, Adrien, Ivan, Mylène.
'''Pigella''': ''(uses her skill)'' [[Gift]]! 
''(A gift is released)''
'''Cat Noir''': Uh... that's her superpower?
'''Ladybug''': Pigella's power shows the person it affects their heart's greatest desire.
''(Pigella's Gift displays a photo of Juleka and Rose along with their classmates)''
'''Pigella''': A normal day in class where everyone just acts normal to Rose. That's it! That's Juleka's greatest wish!
''(Reflekta smiles upon seeing the gift; she regains her happiness and all the bubbles pop around her)''
'''Cat Noir''': Wow, impressive! 
'''Pigella''': The power of positivity.
'''Ladybug''': We don't always need a spectacular fight to succeed.
''(Cat Noir executes Cataclysm on Reflekta's right hand and the akuma is released. Ladybug de-evilizes it.)''
'''Ladybug''': Gotcha! ''(The butterfly is released and flies away)'' Bye bye, little butterfly.
''(Reflekta reverts back into Juleka)''
'''Juleka''': ''(dazed)'' Uhh, what happened?
'''Pigella''': Everything's all right now, Juleka. I'm Pigella, and Ladybug and Cat Noir and I have come to save you. Oh?
''(Ladybug, Cat Noir and Pigella are shocked as the bunch of furious, angry, and spiteful looking Reflekta clones appear)''
'''Cat Noir''': Uh, the sentimonster and its buddies don't seem very happy.
'''Ladybug''': Reflekta isn't here anymore to control them. Quick, where's the object the amok went into? You know, Shadow Moth's feather?
'''Juleka''': In the trash...
'''Cat Noir''': You threw it in the trash?! ''(his ring begins to beep)''
'''Ivan''': You can tell yourself all the lies you want! ''(Shoots a beam)''
'''Alya''': You can never escape the bottomless pit of your guilt! ''(Shoots a beam)''
'''Pigella''': Yes you can! ''(She deflects numerous beams with her tambourine.)'' You just gotta change the music!
'''Cat Noir''': Great job, Pigella! ''(starts to deflect the beams)''
'''Pigella''': It's not the problems that matter but how you get though them that counts!
'''Ladybug''': We've gotta get out of here fast! ''(Everyone ascends the sentimonster while being chased by the clones, but the wind picks up and they get stuck)'' The wind is too strong, we won't get out this way! ''(screams as she is nearly blown away)''
'''Cat Noir''': I guess we're all out of luck!
