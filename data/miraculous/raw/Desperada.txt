{{Scene|Scene: [[Liberty|Couffaine Houseboat.]]}}
<poem>
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]''': You're so talented, Luka. How long have you been playing for?
'''[[Luka Couffaine|Luka]]''': Since I was in diapers. ''(strums guitar)''
'''Marinette''': ''(giggles)''
'''[[Alix Kubdel|Alix]]''': I get a feeling Marinette likes Luka a lot.
'''[[Alya Césaire|Alya]]''': At least she can have a normal conversation with him without getting all ''(babbles)'' blahblah blahblah blahblah blahblah!
'''[[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]]''': I guess you mean not like when she's with Adrien.
'''Alix''': And at least Luka gets to go out whenever he wants.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Seine]]. [[Kagami Tsurugi|Kagami]] and Adrien arrived at the Couffaine houseboat.}}
'''Kagami''': Thank you.
{{Scene|Scene: Couffaine houseboat. The three girls watch Marinette and Luka together.}}
<poem>
'''Mylène''': They're so cute together.
'''Alix''': So true.
'''Alya''': Sure are.
'''[[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]]''': You think? ''(they gasp)''
'''Kagami''': I agree. That boy and your friend seem to get along very well.
'''Alya''': Adrien! Kagami!
'''Alix''': Your father let you out?!
'''Adrien''': We're officially at fencing practice right now, but -- Oh, no, Kagami. Isn't this the wrong address?
'''Kagami''': Oh, dear, I think you're right.
''(Adrien and Kagami chuckle. Marinette starts to frown)''
'''Luka''': It's a good thing Adrien's found someone he can get out of the house with at last.
'''Marinette''': ...Hi, Adrien. It's cool you couldn't come alone. Oh-I mean, you came with someone. ''(giggles nervously)'' Hey Kagamoo-- Ah, Kamoogi-- Uh Kagami...
'''Kagami''': Nice to see you too, Marinette. Have you come to watch your boyfriend rehearse?
''(Marinette stammers.)''
'''[[Anarka Couffaine|Anarka]]''': ''(shouting from the boat's deck above)'' I will NOT be your second choice!
'''[[Jagged Stone]]''': But you've always been my muse, please--!
''(The teens all run off to find the commotion; Alya and Marinette stay behind)''
'''Alya''': Kagami might be on to something, you know.
'''Marinette''': Luka? You know he's just a friend. ''(Marinette runs off; Alya sighs and follows her.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Seine]].}}
<poem>
'''Jagged Stone''': You know perfectly well you were my first choice. You're the only one, Nanarky.
'''[[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]] & Luka''': ''(both confused)'' "Nanarky"?
'''Anarka''': You can't fool me, pirate. I bet you threw your guitarist overboard ''again!''
'''Jagged Stone''': No, I swear, I didn't. She sailed away from me, she left me in the lurch. ''(shows the album they made when they were together)'' Look how perfect we were together. Come back and play with me, Nanarky. ''(blows her an air kiss while playing the piano)''
'''Juleka and Luka''': Jagged and our mom?
'''Anarka''': ''(slowly smiles but snaps out of her trance when she sees the twins looking at her)'' We're not co-captains anymore. I sail alone now, skipper! ''(walks away)''
''(Jagged starts to frown, but then he sees Marinette)''
'''Jagged Stone''': Marinette! You're here! ''(eagerly presses multiple notes on the keyboard)'' The awesome designer of these rock 'n' roll shades of mine. I'm sure ''you'' can help me. I need a guitarist like yesterday. Do you play guitar?
'''Marinette''': Me? -- Guitar? I-I can play a few notes on the flute, but I don't think... 
''(Alya points gestures toward Luka and Adrien's general direction.)''
'''Marinette''': No wait, Jagged. I know the perfect musician.
'''Jagged Stone''': Really? You rock, Marinette!
'''Marinette''': I'm sure you know Adrien Agreste. He's the cutest -- uh -- the greatest model -- I mean, musician in the world!
''(Everyone gasps)''
'''Adrien''': Well, I know a few chords, but I'm more of a pianist actually.
'''Jagged Stone''': Uh, okay, you sure? How 'bout that young dude with the awesome T-shirt? Don't you think he's better equipped for the job?
'''Marinette''': Of course! You're right, Jagged! ''(they sigh)'' Luka can let Adrien borrow his guitar, can't you, Luka?
'''Luka''': If you like, Marinette... ''(they groan)'' put it to good use, Adrien.
'''Adrien''': I'll do my best. Thanks.
''(Before Adrien could play, a villain appears)''
'''[[Vivica|Desperada]]''': '''''Jagged Stone!''''' So you fire me, and now you want to replace me with what? A ''school-kid?''
'''Jagged Stone''': Vivica? Is that you?
'''Desperada''': There ain’t no more Vivica! There's only Desperada now. If ''I'' can't be your guitarist anymore, ''I'm gonna make sure NOBODY can!''
'''Anarka''': ''(overhears the conversation)'' Ah-hah! You ship rat! I knew you were lying. Vivica didn't leave you. You dropped her just like you would drop me before! ''(Jagged Stone groans)''
'''Desperada''': ''What?'' You were thinking of replacing me with ''HER?!''
'''Anarka''': Hey! I'm a much better guitarist than you, and ''I'' was his ''first'' choice. 
'''Desperada''': In that case, you'll be ''my'' first choice ''too!'' ''(fires at Anarka and she disappears)'' I never miss a musical note. Vivica ALWAYS hits her targets! ''(fires at Kagami and she disappears as well)'' 
''(Desperada starts to fire at and disappear all people in Paris.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Couffaine houseboat.}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': I never should've given that guitar to Adrien. Why did I do that, Tikki?
'''[[Tikki]]''': You have a troubled heart, Marinette.
'''Marinette''': ''(groans)'' What is happening to me?! Tikki, spots on!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Seine.}}
<poem>
'''Luka''': ''(to Adrien)'' Not there. You'd be a sitting duck in that cabin.
'''Desperada''': Where are you running to, wannabe?
'''Jagged Stone''': Stop it, Vivica, you're giving rock 'n' roll a bad name.
''(Desperada fires at Jagged Stone and he disappears)''
'''[[Penny Rolling]]''': Jagged--? No--! ''(disappears)''
'''[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]]''': I may not play a guitar, but I ''do'' play the yo-yo. Care for a duet?
'''Desperada''': Solo!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Seine riverbank.}}
<poem>
'''Luka''': We'll be safe here.
'''Adrien''': Thank you, Luka.
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] ''(o.s.)''''': ''Perfect, Desperada!''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair]].}}
'''Hawk Moth''': [[Ladybug Miraculous|Ladybug's Miraculous]] are within reach.
{{Scene|Scene: Seine riverbank.}}
<poem>
'''Desperada''': I ''always'' keep my end of the deal, Hawk Moth.
''(Desperada and Ladybug fight)''
'''Luka''': Where's Cat Noir?
'''Adrien''': He might not make it here in time.
'''Luka''': Then we must help Ladybug. May I? ''(plays guitar)''
'''Desperada''': Another new guitarist?? ''(disappears everything faster)''
''(Ladybug throws away Desperada with her yo-yo. The riverbank breaks down with an unprecedented smash. Ladybug uses her Lucky vision with no [[Lucky Charm]].)''
'''Ladybug''': This way -- quick!
'''Desperada''': ''You won't get away for long!!!''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Sewers. Luka, Adrien, and Ladybug are running.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': You shouldn't have put yourself in danger like that. But... thank you.
'''Luka''': You can count on us whenever you need help. ''(plays guitar)''
'''Ladybug''': I appreciate it, but when you're dealing with a supervillain, it's better to have a partner with [[Miraculous superpowers|superpowers]]. Speaking of which...
'''Cat Noir's voice''': <code>''Cat got your tongue? Leave a message.''</code>
'''Ladybug''': Okay.
</poem>
<center>'''''[Superpower Sequence]'''''<br />'''Ladybug''': [[Lucky Charm]]!<br />''(A [[List of Lucky Charm objects|gong]] appears)''</center>
<poem>
'''Luka''': A gong? What're you gonna do with that?
'''Ladybug''': I'm gonna have to leave you guys for now, but I'll be back soon.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Paris.}}
<poem>
'''Desperada''': I'll find that brat guitarist sooner or later, Ladybug!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Sewers.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': I can handle this. Could I... borrow that, please?
'''Luka''': You know how to play?
'''Ladybug''': Let's just say I have my ''own'' personal style. Meanwhile, find a place to hide. Both of you!
''(Ladybug uses her Lucky vision. Luka and Adrien run into the locker.)''
'''Adrien''': You can hide in here. It's a bit tight for the two of us. I'll go in another one.
'''Luka''': Okay -- see you later.
'''[[Plagg]]''': How about a little nap while we wait for Ladybug to come back?
'''Adrien''': No, it's time for Cat Noir to make his entrance.
</poem>
<center>'''''[Transformation Sequence]'''''<br />'''Adrien''': Plagg, claws out!<br />''(Adrien transforms into Cat Noir.)''</center>
{{Scene|Scene: Paris.}}
<poem>
'''Desperada''': Ugh! Who is torturing that poor guitar?!
''([[Xavier Ramier|Xavier's]] pigeons play loud music. Desperada disappears all pigeons.)''
'''Desperada''': That's better.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Fu's massage shop]]. Master Fu opens the gramophone to reveal the [[Chinese Miracle Box|Miracle Box]], and places the box between him and Marinette.}}
<poem>
'''[[Wang Fu|Master Fu]]''': Marinette Dupain-Cheng. You must pick an ally you can trust to fight alongside you on this mission. Once the mission is over, you will take the [[Miraculouses|Miraculous]] back and return it to me.
'''Marinette''': Desperada's relentless. There's no room for error with her -- there'll be no second chance. Or maybe this one.
'''Master Fu''': The snake's power is a very strong one, Marinette. Whoever uses it must be wise enough, not to be tempted to manipulate time for their own personal gain. 
'''Marinette''': I understand, Master Fu, I know ''just'' the perfect person. I can't believe I didn't think of him before -- a perfect match.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Sewers. Cat Noir climbs up. Ladybug and Cat Noir fall.}}
<poem>
'''[[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]''': We must stop running into each other like this, M'lady. Let's take care of this guitarist and her seriously bad music. Uh, you lookin' for something, M'lady?
'''Ladybug''': Phew! Yeah, I have to find Adrien Agreste!
'''Cat Noir''': You wanna entrust ''him'' with a [[Snake Miraculous|Miraculous]]?
'''Ladybug''': You're not supposed to know, but, yeah! He's the perfect guy for this mission.
'''Cat Noir''': You know, you can trust me and my incredible nose. If Adrien's down here, I'll find him for you. Adrien's in there.
'''Ladybug''': Your incredible nose failed you this time.
'''Luka''': Cat Noir. Ladybug. Have you defeated Desperada yet? Oh, where's Adrien?
'''Cat Noir''': Um, maybe he took off and hid somewhere else. Let's split up and find him. Hide in there for the mean time. Claws in! ''(detransforms)''
'''Adrien''': Plagg, Ladybug needs me. She needs "Adrien"!
'''Plagg''': If you asked me, this whole idea is worse than cheese in a can.
'''Adrien''': She thinks ''I'm'' the perfect guy for this mission.
'''Plagg''': You can't be Cat Noir ''and'' another superhero at the same time! Which means that you're ''not'' the perfect guy for this mission.
'''Adrien''': The [[Marinette's bracelet|Lucky Charm]] told her I am.
'''Plagg''': That's not how it works. Why am I bothering? You're not even listening.
'''Adrien''': This is my chance to get her to love me as myself! "Adrien"! I don't care what costume comes with it, I have to try. Ladybug chose me!
'''Ladybug ''(o.s.)''''': Adrien?! ''(back onscreen)'' Adrien?!
'''Adrien''': Uh... Ladybug?
'''Ladybug''': Where were you? Is everything okay?
'''Adrien''': Yeah. I was just hiding a bit further down. I thought it'd be better if Desperada couldn't find us both in the same place.
'''Ladybug''': I need you.
'''Adrien''': Me?
'''Ladybug''': Adrien Agreste, here's the Miraculous of the snake, which grants the power of [[Second Chance]]. You will use it for the greater good. ''(Adrien takes the box)'' Once we defeat the supervillain, you will return the Miraculous to me. ''(starts to act like Marinette)'' Can I love -- Uh, trust you?
'''Adrien''': Yes, Ladybug. ''(places the box in the palm of his hand and opens it)''
''(A glow appears out of the box. Sass appears between Adrien.)''
'''Adrien''': Amazing!
'''[[Sass]]''': Greetings. My name is Sass, and I'll be your Kwami.
'''Adrien''': But what am I supposed to do?
'''Sass''': All you have to say is... "Sass, scales slither."
''(Adrien opens the box and takes out the Snake Miraculous. Plagg quietly gives Adrien a gesture not to do it. Adrien puts on the Snake Miraculous.)''
</poem>
<center>'''''[Transformation Sequence]'''''<br />'''Adrien''': Sass, scales slither!<br />''(Adrien transforms into Aspik.)''</center>
<poem>
'''Cat Noir's voice''': <code>''Cat got your tongue? Leave a message.''</code>
'''Ladybug''': Cat! I found Adrien. We're gonna go after Desperada. Meet us under [[Trocadéro]] square fa--!
'''[[Adrien Agreste|Aspik]]''': I hope I don't disappoint you, Ladybug.
'''Ladybug''': I know you won't. You're perfect. Uh, perfectly ''capable'' of defeating Desperada! We need ''all'' the odds in our favor. Desperada is a fearsome opponent.
</poem>
<center>'''''[Superpower Sequence]'''''<br />'''Ladybug''': Lucky Charm!<br />''(A [[List of Lucky Charm objects|saddle]] appears)''</center>
<poem>
'''Aspik''': I would have preferred a horseshoe for my first mission.
'''Ladybug''': ''(giggles)'' I love your sense of humor!
'''Aspik''': Really? Thanks!
'''Ladybug''': If anything goes wrong, the [[Second Chance]] allows you to go back in time to the exact moment you activated it.
'''Aspik''': Got it.
</poem>
<center>'''''[Superpower Sequence]'''''<br />'''Aspik''': Second chance. ''(adjusts bangle)''</center>
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': We now have five minutes. Within this time range, you can go back in time as many times as you want. But after that, when the head of the snake goes back in place, you'll detransform. Still no Cat... Come to think of it, we're okay without him. Now that we have ''your'' power, you and I are gonna make an awesome team.
''(Ladybug and Aspik climb up. Plagg groans.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Paris.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': ... Where is she?
''(Desperada materializes out of nowhere.)''
'''Desperada''': Nobody can escape me from here.
''(Desperada disappears Ladybug.)''
'''Hawk Moth ''(o.s.)''''': ''Very nice, Desperada.''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Hawk Moth's lair.}}
'''Hawk Moth''': Once you've captured Cat Noir and you don't need your powers anymore, these stickers will release the heroes and their Miraculous will be mine.
{{Scene|Scene: Paris.}}
<poem>
'''Plagg''': ''(indignant)'' Awesome team, all right!
'''Aspik''': Gimme some time.
</poem>
{{Scene|Alternate scene: Sewers. Aspik's time reverses.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': We now have five minutes--
'''Aspik''': Before I transform back, I know.
'''Ladybug''': Did we not make it?
'''Aspik''': No, but I used my power of second chance. No time to wait for Cat Noir -- we're fine without him. You'll see, we're gonna make an awesome team -- Aspik and Ladybug.
'''Ladybug''': Aspik? Wow! You've only just started being a superhero and you already seem to have all of this down.
'''Aspik''': Guess you made the right choice, Ladybug.
''(Ladybug and Aspik climb up. Plagg groans.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Alternate scene: Paris.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': ... Where is she?
'''Aspik''': No, wait. The first time, Desperada's fire came from there.
''(Ladybug and Aspik run.)''
'''Aspik''': Here. As a thank you for choosing me.
'''Ladybug''': Oh! Uh, thanks! ''(Aspik shrugs)''
''(Desperada disappears Ladybug.)''
'''Plagg''': ''(indignant)'' Awesome team, all right!
'''Aspik''': I just need a bit more time.
'''Plagg''': To do what?! Charm Ladybug?! Or defeat the villain?!
'''Aspik''': Second chance!
</poem>
{{Scene|Alternate scene: Sewers. Aspik's time reverses.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': We know have five -- AH!
'''Aspik''': Trust me -- we've been through this before.
'''Ladybug''': Shouldn't we wait for Cat Noir?
'''Aspik''': No need, let's try a different exit this time.
'''Ladybug''': So you saved my life several times already? I knew! --
'''Aspik''': We'd make an awesome team? I hope you're right.
'''Ladybug''': ''(quietly)'' He can read my mind too.
</poem>
{{Scene|Alternate scene: Paris.}}
<poem>
'''Aspik''': This seems okay here.
'''Ladybug''': Adrien -- I mean, snake...
'''Aspik''': Call me Aspik.
'''Ladybug''': Aspik, you really ''are'' a super--
''(Desperada disappears Ladybug.)''
'''Plagg''': Awesome team, all --
'''Aspik''': I know! ''(time reverses)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Alternate scene: Paris. Desperada disappears Ladybug again.}}
'''Aspik''': Not again!
{{Scene|Alternate scene: Paris. Desperada disappears Ladybug again and again.}}
'''Aspik''': No, no, no!
{{Scene|Alternate scene: Sewers. Desperada disappears Ladybug again and again.}}
{{Scene|Alternate scene: Paris. Desperada disappears Ladybug again and again.}}
<poem>
'''Aspik''': You know, Ladybug? I'm ''actually'' also Cat Noir and I've been in love with you since our eyes first met.
''(Desperada disappears Ladybug.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Alternate scene: Paris. Desperada disappears Ladybug... several times in a row.}}
{{Scene|Scene: Sewers.}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': We now have five minutes. Within this time range, you can go back in time as many times as you want --
'''Aspik''': Sass, scales rest. ''(detransforms; and catches him in his hands)''
'''Ladybug''': But...
'''Adrien''': It didn't work. I'm so sorry. I wasn't the right choice for you after all.
''(Plagg sighs)''
'''Ladybug''': No! You ''have'' to be the right snake. I guess ''I'' must've done something wrong.
'''Adrien''': No, it's not you. I just can't protect you. I never managed to save you.
'''Ladybug''': We can try again.
'''Adrien''': No, I can't bear seeing Desperada capture you every time without ever being able to save you.
'''Ladybug''': How many times did you see me?
'''Adrien''': I've been trying for months. It was 25,913th time. I don't know what to ''do'' anymore!
'''Ladybug''': But... who could possibly wear this Miraculous beside to you?
'''Luka''': Ladybug? ''(appears)'' Oh, I see you found Adrien. I'm glad, I was worried.
'''Adrien''': ... Brave? Determined? Caring? Why don't you give ''him'' the Miraculous?
'''Ladybug''': Thank you for saving my life so many times, Adrien. ''(kisses)''
'''Adrien''': I'll go and hide. I'm sure you guys will succeed, Ladybug.
'''Luka''': Did I miss something? 
'''Ladybug''': Luka Couffaine, here is the Miraculous of the snake, which grants the power of Second Chance. You will use it for the greater good, if you're willing. ''(Luka takes the box)'' Once we succeed, you must return the Miraculous to me. Can I trust you?
'''Luka''': Desperada attacked my family, and my friends. So if I can help you anyway, I will. ''(places the box in the palm of his hand and opens it)''
''(A glow appears out of the box. Sass appears between Luka and Ladybug.)''
'''Sass''': Greetings. My name is Sass, and I'll be your Kwami.
'''Plagg''': Ah! At last, you've come to your senses.
'''Adrien''': I'm not sure Ladybug will have very fond memories of her experience with "Adrien Agreste".
'''Plagg''': Then make up for it as Cat Noir.
'''Adrien''': You're right.
</poem>
<center>'''''[Transformation Sequence]'''''<br />'''Adrien''': Plagg, claws out!<br />''(Adrien transforms into Cat Noir.)''</center>
'''Sass''': All you have to say is... "Sass, scales slither."
<center>'''''[Transformation Sequence]'''''<br />'''Luka''': Sass, scales slither!<br />''(Luka transforms into Viperion.)''</center>
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': Just in time. Cat Noir, I'd like you to meet --
'''[[Luka Couffaine|Viperion]]''': Viperion. Can't wait to work with you.
''(Ladybug sees Desperada.)''
'''Cat Noir''': ''(to Luka)'' Perhaps you would've preferred a lucky horseshoe for your first mission.
'''Ladybug''': Cat!
'''Viperion''': No need. Ladybug brings enough luck for all of us. ''(Cat Noir nods)''
'''Ladybug''': Thanks. Desperada's at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]]! Let's take her vantage point away from her! We're gonna need your [[Cataclysm]]! Our team would be lost without him!
'''Cat Noir''': At your service, m'lady! Here! Cataclysm!
</poem>
<center>'''''[Superpower Sequence]'''''<br />'''Cat Noir''': Cataclysm!<br />''(Cat Noir uses his Cataclysm)''</center>
{{Scene|Scene: Eiffel Tower. A big crash occurs; Desperada falls down.}}

''(Desperada disappears Ladybug)''

''(Ladybug catches the right hand with her yo-yo and Viperion catches the left hand with his lyre. Cat Noir slides down to wrap saddle around Desperada's ankles. He throws the guitar case into the air and Ladybug uses her yo-yo to destroy the guitar case)''

</poem>
<center>'''''[Superpower Sequence]'''''<br />'''Ladybug''': Time to de-evilize! ''(Ladybug catches the akuma)'' Gotcha!</center>
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': Bye-bye, little butterfly. [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug!]] ''(She throws the saddle into the air, the Miraculous Cure restores damage and turns Desperada back into Vivica)''

'''Luka''': Thank you for trusting me.
'''Ladybug''': You were the right choice, Luka. I'm sure we'll see each other again soon. Bug out!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Couffaine houseboat.}}
<poem>
'''Jagged Stone''': I know I wasn't very rock 'n' roll to you, Vivica. And even if you ''did'' eat my cereal and drink Fang's milk, I should've never fired you that way. You can come back if you want, but get your own breakfast, okay?
'''Vivica''': I promise, Jagged.
'''Jagged Stone''':  Besides, I get why Anarka no longer wants to play with me. And I respect her decision, what's past is past, isn't that right, Nanarky? ''(Anarka nods)''
'''Kagami''': I was wrong about you and Luka, wasn't I? But you'd better hurry up and choose, Marinette. You don't always get a second chance when it comes to love.
'''Alya''': Well, Adrien and Luka can choose too, right? And they haven't made their choice yet, either.
