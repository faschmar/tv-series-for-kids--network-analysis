<poem>
'''Sabine''': Ah! Ding Ox, fire and yin. Not so great. Unless... ''(while arranging a flower vase)'' There. This should prevent negative energy from flowing in.
''(She grabs her pen and book from table beside her bed and heads to get their laundry basket.)''
'''Sabine''': ''(places the laundry basket at the bottom of the staircase)'' There!
(She turns on the television to play calming music and starts meditating. As the music continues to play, she gracefully places her book on the table and a sponge on the floor. She prepares tea on the table, turns on the thermos and the stove on, organizes her painting materials and answers the phone.)'' 
'''Sabine''': Dimsum Delight? Yes, I'd like to make a reservation. For noon. Two people.
''(She continues to prepare breakfast as the music continues playing as she finishes her mediation. [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] comes down the stairs, yawning, trips on her feet and tumbles down, causing her to fall on the laundry basket Sabine placed earlier.)''
'''Sabine''': Morning, honey. Did you stay up all night doing homework again?
''(The news starts to be broadcasted on television.)''
'''[[Nadja Chamack]]''': ''(on TV)'' Last night, Ladybug and Cat Noir successfully prevented the explosion of a turbine of a cocoa shop factory, saving Paris from drowning in rotten chocolate.
'''Man on the TV''': It's a bunch of lies! The chocolate turbine was perfectly cleaned!
'''Marinette''': ''(chuckles)'' Yeah, ''lots'' of homework, Mom.
'''Sabine''': Will you start the laundry please, honey? ''(heads to the bakery and gives Tom a cup of coffee)'' Your coffee, my love.
'''[[Tom Dupain|Tom]]''': Aww, thanks, my sweet honey bun. ''(kisses Sabine)''
''(Sabine goes back upstairs and swiftly checks on Marinette's height, marking it on the wall with her pen.)''
'''Sabine''': My, you've grown again!
''(Marinette sits on the dining table and pours milk on her bowl. She shortly bumped her arm on the milk carton, causing to spill on the floor.)''
'''Marinette''': ''(nervously)'' Ah! Sorry!
'''Sabine''': It's alright, sweetie. ''(grabs the sponge that absorbed the spilled milk)''
'''Marinette''': ''(spots the magazine on the table)'' Oh, Mom! My shoes are getting too small. Do you think you could buy me a new pair?
'''Sabine''': What a good idea, honey! Why don't you meet me right after my painting class?
'''Marinette''': Oh! Let's get some dimsum for lunch before we go to the store!
'''Sabine''': Of course!
'''[[Clara Contard]]''': ''(on TV)'' We interrupt our regular newscast for a sentimonster alert. Lollipop Boy has just made a reappearance in the city square.
'''Marinette''': ''(panics)'' Ah! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! I'm super late for class!
'''Sabine''': Marinette, it's Saturday. There's no school today.
'''Marinette''': Oh, right. I meant, late for Alya's. We're doing a presentation together.
'''Sabine''': You won't forget to meet me at the end of my class?
'''Marinette''': I won't!
'''Sabine''': And you won't forget to buy a ticket for the bus?
'''Marinette''': Promise!
'''Sabine''': And you won't forget to change, will you?
'''Marinette''': ''(realized that she's still wearing pajamas)'' What? AH! ''(dashes to her room upstairs)''

<poem>
'''[[Tikki]]''': Your mom is really amazing. Even though she's so busy, she always manages to organize so well!
'''Marinette''': The exact opposite of me. Do you realize Tikki, I'm more than a month late for Mother's Day! I wanted to make her something but with everything going on I barely had time get started on it. It's such a bummer because today would've been the perfect day to make it up to her. ''(Gasps)'' Hang on! What if I buy her a gift before going to meet her, and give it to her at the restaurant!
'''Tikki''': Great idea Marinette! But first, we've got to take care of a sentimonster.
'''Marinette''': ''(nods)'' Tikki, spots on! ''(A red light flashes from inside her room and Ladybug appears, swinging from off the balcony)''

<poem>
'''Tom''': ''(Handing Sabine a to-go bag as she approaches him)'' The choquettes for your students are ready to go my brilliant artist!
'''Sabine''': Thanks my love. ''(Sabine kisses him goodbye and heads out the door)''
</poem>
{{Scene| Sabine is running her painting class in the [[Art classroom]] at the [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]}}
<poem>
'''Sabine''': Chinese paintbrushes are very different from western paintbrushes. ''(One student takes and eats a choquette from the plate, the six students are shown stroking their paintbrushes against their paper)'' They allow you to easily master the five shades of ink. Dry, concentrate, thick, clear and diluted. ''(Walks over to Nadja Chamack and fixes her position of the paintbrush)'' If you use them well, all these nuances can make up all the colors, texture and light you need to represent the world. 
''(The tables shake and a loud thud occurs from outside the building. The class get up to look out the window.)''
</poem>

''([[Lollipop Boy]] walks past the building while dragging Ladybug who's trying to hold to him by wrapping around his waist with her [[Yo-yo]].)''
'''Ladybug''': Cat Noir, use your stick to block his way!
'''[[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]''': ''(Running along on top of the the school)'' Got it M'lady! ''(Cat Noir spreads his staff to the ground to stop the lollipop sentimonster, the class watch Lollipop Boy trip and fall to the ground)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Art classroom]]}}
<poem>
'''Sabine''': Those poor kids. They spent the whole night saving Paris, and they're already back in action.
''(The miraculous Ladybug's are summoned and fix the broken structures caused the Lollipop sentimonster. Ladybug and Chat Noir jump from building to building to return)''
'''Nadja Chamack''': ''(On a phone call)'' I'm here and watching it right now.
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: In the alleys, Ladybug detransforms}}
<poem>
'''Ladybug''': Spots off! ''(Marinette de-transforms back into her pajamas and feeds Tikki a macaroon)'' Now we can go meet up with my mom! 
'''Tikki''': But Marinette, you can't go looking like that.
'''Marinette''': AHH! I gotta get back to the house, hide Tikki! ''(Starts to run out from the alley)''
</poem>

<poem>
''(Sabine walks out and down to a nearby bus station. She turns on her phone, which says 11:05, and calls Marinette)''
'''Marinette's voicemail''': It's Marinette, leave a message! Beep!
'''Sabine''': ''(To Marinette's voicemail)'' Honey, it's mom! You have exactly four choquettes to show up. ''(The bus arrives and Sabine gets on)'' Good day sir. Would you mind if I put this here while I look for my wallet? 
'''Bus driver''': Oh wow, choquettes!
'''Sabine''': A few left over from my class. They're homemade. You'd be doing me a favor by eating them, as long as it doesn't hold up the bus.
'''Bus driver''': Well if I can be of service to a commuter! ''(Takes and eats one choquette)'' Mm, exquisite! ''(Takes another choquette)'' Mmm, delicious! ''(Takes a third choquette)'' Scrumptious! ''(Takes one more choquette and starts licking his fingers)''
''(Marinette suddenly arrives tired)''
'''Marinette''': EHH! I'm here! ''(Leaning on her knees out of breath)'' 
'''Sabine''': This is my daughter Marinette, who I'm certain did not forget her bus ticket.
'''Marinette''': ''(Gasps)'' Oh shoot! Um well- uh huh the thing is-
'''Sabine''': Marinette, I asked you to remember it.
'''Marinette''': Ah it's no biggie I'll just buy one. ''(Digging into her purse)'' Ahh no I forgot my change.
'''Sabine''': Luckily I've always got a few spares ''(Holding up two tickets)''
'''Marinette''': Thanks super mom! ''(Hugs and kisses her mom on the cheek)'' Mmwah!
''(Sabine scans their tickets on the scanner and they begin to walk through the aisle)''
'''Passenger''': Mhm mhm, look. In terms of the process, when it comes to the re-evaluation of the online-offline products, the market demands a high yield in terms of productivity see what I mean? Mhm. ''(Standing in the handicapped area of the bus while a person in a wheelchair is struggling to move)''
'''Sabine''': ''(Walks over to the passenger)'' Hello sir. Would you be so kind as to let this person access the spot that's reserved for their use?
'''Passenger''': Hey I'm on a conference call here. So what I was saying- Yeah I mean concomitantly with the situational adaptability, the direct manager should make the negotiable systems converge.
''(Sabine forms plan, which shows up in a yellow background with trees, using a traffic light, the rude passenger, a gear on the handicapped person's wheelchair and a paintbrush. Sabine places the paintbrush on the floor in front of the rude passenger.)''
'''Passenger''': No no no we need a strong plan. If we aren't flexible regarding our immobilized relations then we're gonna get cre- ''(The bus slows and pulls to a stop at a corner, the passenger on the phone trips on the paintbrush Sabine placed on the floor. The person in the wheelchair is moved uncontrollably to the handicapped area)''
'''Sabine''': Thank you sir, your sense of civic responsibility is much appreciated.
''(Marinette looks to her surprised then pleased)''
'''Voice on intercom''': Next stop, Louise Michel.
'''Marinette''': Shoot! I forgot the pres- ''(covers her mouth and looks to her mom)'' uhh the presentation, it's a magazine. They're presenting a new magazine with Adrien on the cover. Can I borrow your wallet? I really have to get it.
'''Sabine''': Are you sure? I don't think you'll have time to get off and back on during the stop.
'''Marinette''': ''(Hugging Sabine)'' I'll be so quick, please please please please pleaseee? ''(Sabine nods)''
'''Voice on intercom''': Louise Michel
''(Sabine hands Marinette her wallet and Marinette sprints out of the bus)''
'''Marinette''': Thank you!

{{Scene|Scene: At a nearby flower shop}}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': This one please! ''(Pointing at flower bouquet with pink roses and white flowers)'' Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry.
''(Marinette pays and the florist hands her the flower bouquet)''
'''Tikki''': Um, you're buying a present for your mother with her money? 
'''Marinette''': Yeah yeah I know but I don't have cash with me, I'll pay her back later ''(Looks back and gasps at the bus starting to leave)'' Nooo! ''(Runs after the bus)'' Waittt! Awww ''(Stops and catches her breath)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Inside the bus}}
<poem>
''(Sabine counts on her fingers five seconds until Marinette calls her.)''
'''Voice on intercom''': Next stop, Claire LeCone.
'''Marinette''': ''(on her phone)'' Mom, the bus left without me!
'''Sabine''': I know, honey. I'm on it.
'''Marinette''': What do I do now?
'''Sabine''': I'll get off the next stop and wait for you. Meet me there!
'''Voice on intercom''': Claire LeCone. ''()''
'''Ticket Inspector''': Ticket Inspector, please!
'''Sabine''': Hello, sir. My daughter got off earlier with mine, but we're supposed to meet up at this stop. She shouldn't be too long. Why don't we get off and wait for her together?
'''Ticket Inspector''': No one's ever tried that one on me before. Non-payment affairs, that's a 50 euro five how will you be paid!
'''Sabine''': Unfortunately, sir, I have no money with me. My daughter has my wallet.
'''Ticket Inspector''': Of course, and I suppose you don't have any IDwith you either.
'''Sabine''': Well, obviously. I just explained to you that my daughter has my work...
'''Ticket Inspector''': Right! Well, I guess we'll just see at the next stop. But not with your imaginary daughter, but with a real police officer, who's going to take you in!
'''Sabine''': What? But... That's so unfair!
'''Ticket Inspector''': What's unfair is committing fraud and stealing from Parisians who do pay for their tickets, ma'am!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: }}
<poem>
'''Marinette''': Where is she?
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Outside the Hôtel de Ville.}}
<poem>
'''Ticket Inspector''': Hey there, Roger, I got a customer for you. No ticket, no money, no ID, couldn't get this she even made up a family with a daughter and everything!
'''Sabine''': Ah, Roger, perfect timing! Tell this man I'm not lying. Our daughters are together in the same class.
'''Ticket Inspector''': ''(laughs)'' Seriously? This woman just can't stop lying!
'''[[Roger Raincomprix|Roger]]''': Uh, well the thing is yeah it's the truth but-
'''Sabine''': The truth but, what?
'''Roger''': Well, I'm sorry, Sabine, but you were on the bus without a ticket that's a violation and without ID to boot, you know it's my duty to take you in for an identity check.
'''Sabine''': An identity check? Are you kidding, Roger? We've known each other for years!
'''Ticket Inspector''': Watch out, she's getting aggressive! She's getting aggressive!
'''Roger''': The law is the law.
''()''
'''Sabine''': Oh, hang on.
'''Ticket Inspector''': Whoa, whoa, whoa! ''()'' Don't move! Take her pocket!
'''Sabine''': What is wrong with you people? It must be Marinette, I have to answer she must be worried!
'''Ticket Inspector''': You never know, she might have some dangerous stuff in there!
 ''()''
'''Roger''': Oops.
'''Sabine''': Oh, come on! Be careful will you! Between you and your nonsense and him and his nonsense it's... all nonsense!
'''Roger''': Woah! You need to calm down right now, because you are two inches away from insulting a public official.
'''Ticket Inspector''': Yes, that's right. Insult, insult!
'''Guards 1''': Is there a problem here, Roger?
'''Sabine''': Yes? I am a victim of an injustice!
'''Guards 2''': You'll speak when asked to, ma'am.
'''Roger''': Sabine, we've been as reasonable as we can about all this, but since you're refusing to cooperate, I have no choice but to do my duty.
'''Sabine''': What? But I haven't done anything!
'''Ticket Inspector''': You're not really helping your case, man!
'''Roger''': The law is the law.
'''Sabine''': I don't believe this, are you people humans or robots!
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: [[Hawk Moth's lair|Shadow Moth's lair]]. The lair's window opens up.}}
<poem>
'''[[Gabriel Agreste|Shadow Moth]]''': Injustice, abuse of power and blind ignorance. Three powerful plagues that can cause even the most stable of souls to waver. ''(turns a butterfly into an [[Akuma]])'' It's our responsibility to tip her over the brink! So she can become a choice weapon against Ladybug and Cat Noir! ''(The Akuma flies away.)''
</poem>
{{Scene|Scene: Hôtel de Ville.}}
<poem>
''(The Akuma lands onto Sabine's handcuffs.)''
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Qilin, I am Shadow Moth. They put you in handcuffs despite your innocence. Thanks to me, you can repair this injustice.
'''Sabine''': I refuse to hurt anyone! You can keep your power, you devious insect!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Oh you're judging me without knowing me, when I'm actually just like you. A victim of misunderstanding. And like you, I don't want to hurt anyone.
'''Sabine''': I don't believe you!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Here's proof. If you accept, I will offer you a mighty power to accomplish your noble mission.
'''Sabine''': So be it! When all the injustices have been writing peace will prevail!
''(Sabine transforms into Qilin)''

'''Sabine's voicemail''': You've reached Sabine Dupain-Cheng's voicemail.
'''Marinette''': This is so weird, Tikki. My mom would never have just left me like this.
''(A horde of police cars pass by Marinette.)''
'''Guards in helicopter''': You're under arrest! Give yourself up now!
''()''
'''Qilin''': Take these handcuffs off me!
''()''
'''Marinette''': Oh no! What if mom's in trouble? ''(hides behind an ad of Adrien Agreste)'' Tikki, spots on! ''(transforms into Ladybug)''

{{Scene|Scene: }}

'''Guards''': No way I'm going back there!
''()''
'''Bus driver''': Thanks, Ladybug.
'''Ladybug''': Where's mom— I— ma'am! The ma'am with the choquette.
'''Bus driver''': She was arrested by the police.
'''Ladybug''': Arrested? There's no way!

{{Scene|Scene: Hôtel de Ville.}}

'''Qilin''': You're unworthy of your mission. Ignorance has corrupted your souls! Qilin will show you the true meaning of justice. Move the mountains!
''()''
'''Qilin''': Climb the lightning bolts!
''()''
'''Qilin''':
''()''
'''Roger''': General, use the armored trucks to block the perimeter we need to attack from the west!
'''Ticket Inspector''': Ask for backup! Get more backup!
'''Roger''': Sir- I mean, Mr. Mayor, where are those tanks you promised and the fighter jets?
'''Qilin''': Trembles earth! ''()'' I am innocent. Get these handcuffs, off me otherwise it's you who will suffer under the weight of injustice!
''()''
'''Ladybug''': Stop! You're putting innocent lives in danger!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' Ladybug, where was she when your innocence was in question, Qilin? Don't listen to this hypocrite, take her Miraculous!
'''Qilin''': If they're serving injustice, then they are not innocent, and if you defend them, then you're not on the side of justice either!
''()''
'''Cat Noir''': Careful m'lady, the weather forecast predicted a shower of objects!
''(Using his staff in umbrella mode to defend them both)''
'''Ladybug''': Good thing you've got your stuff umbrella then, kitty cat.
''()''
'''Cat Noir''': First one to catch it gets the girls butterfly!
'''Ladybug''': Isn't a game, Cat Noir?
'''Qilin''': Roll back the waves!
''(Ladybug gets tied up)''
'''Cat Noir''': Woohoooo!
'''Qilin''': Capture the rainbow!
''(Qilin caught Cat Noir by his staff and tossed him in the river)''
'''Cat Noir''': She's impossible to catch!
'''Ladybug''': Not to mention even getting near her!
'''Cat Noir''': How do we break the object that holds the akuma?
'''Qilin''': Bring in the net, and flip the turtle! ''()'' An injustice to one is a threat to all. Take these handcuffs off me!
'''Ladybug''': I think things are more complicated than they seem, we have to find out more. Cover me!
''()''
'''Cat Noir''': Those are some poetic nicknames you have for your attacks. I like them a lot. Where do you get your inspiration from?
'''Qilin''': Crush the cat! ''()''
'''Cat Noir''': Not such a fan of this one!
''()''
'''Ladybug''': Any of you know what injustice the super villain's talking about?
'''Guard 2''': How would I know she started?
'''Guard 1''': It's not our fault! We're just following orders!
'''Ladybug''': What was she like before she got akumulatized?
'''Guard 3''': Terrifying really stubborn and a liar.
'''Guard 2''': She kept saying she had a daughter who got off the bus with the tickets. 
'''Guard 1''': But insisted she was coming back, a lot of baloney.
''()''
'''Ladybug''': Your daughter, who got off with the tickets?
'''Cat Noir''': Well, how about we find that daughter?
''()''
'''Ladybug''': That could work. The injustice will be impaired you have no reason to stay akumatized. Let's see if your idea is really that good. Cover me!
'''Cat Noir''': Excuse me, I got the impression you were trying to say something just now with that flying truck.
''()''
'''Cat Noir''': All right, it's much clearer now!
'''Ladybug''': What you don't know kitty cat is that for Marinette to appear I'd have to de-transform. That's pretty risky, I better be sure it'll work and calm down mom before I do it.
''(Tying her yo-yo to a lamppost)''
'''Ladybug''': Roger, it's silly to fight over a few bus tickets!
'''Roger and Qilin''': It's not a matter of tickets, it's a matter of principle!
''()''
'''Ladybug''': We find the girl who principles them we can prove that all of this was just a misunderstanding!
'''Shadow Moth''': ''(from his lair)'' She's lying, it's a trap!
'''Qilin''': Really? They don't stop attacking me?
'''Ladybug''': I promise you.
''()''
'''Qilin''': Take these handcuffs off me!
'''Roger''': Absolutely not! ''()''  My duty is in question, you were on the bus without a ticket, you were breaking the law!
'''Ticket Inspector''': And the law is the law!
'''Qilin''': Your mistaking law for justice integrity without intelligence is nothing but blind ignorance!
'''Roger''': General, begin operation: butterfly net!
''()''
'''Qilin''': Chase the storm!
''()''
'''Cat Noir''': Oh well, so much for my great idea back to the old-fashioned way miraculously swipe those handcuffs and break them!
'''Ladybug''': Exactly.
<center>'''''[Superpower sequence]''<br />Ladybug:''' [[Lucky Charm]]!<br />''(She gets [[List of Lucky Charm objects#Season 4|a ray Gun]].)''</center>
'''Ladybug''': A ray Gun?
''(She looks around and only Roger's keys light up)''
'''Ladybug''': To stop this all we need to do is remove those handcuffs and I just need the key to do that so why a ray gun? ''(to Roger)'' Roger, give me your keys!
'''Ticket Inspector''': Are you out of your mind? She's already unstoppable wet handcuffs if we take them off you'll destroy everything!
'''Roger''': He's right!
'''Ladybug''': Stop being so stubborn! ''(Coming towards Roger with her yo-yo in shield mode)'' If you don't give them to me, I'll take them by force!
'''Roger''': In that case, you two will be breaking the law, Miss Ladybug! ''(Blows his whistle)'' Guys, cover me!
'''Guards''': Charged!
''(Her version eye's the guards, one of their shields, a manhole cover and Cat Noir)''
'''Ladybug''': Of course! That's what I was missing!
'''Cat Noir''': More opponents?
'''Ladybug''': Sort of, in order to decoupage we also have to stop the attacks from the police! Here's my plan!
''(She whispered the plan into his ear and Ladybug grabbed the shield placing over the manhole cover and using the ray gun to make it shape removing the cover Cat Noir slids down and Ladybug places the glass over the manhole afterwards the hero activates his power.)''
'''Cat Noir''': [[Cataclysm]]!

Always keep it with you it'll protect you from Shadow Moth.
'''Ladybug and Cat Noir''': Pound it!
'''Roger''': All right, let's go to the station, now!
'''Ticket Inspector''': Yes, identity check custody and the whole works?
'''Cat Noir''': Hang on, I know Miss Dupain-Cheng! No one in the world is more upright and honest than she is!
'''Ladybug''': Roger, we won't stop you from doing your duty, but you have to promise me you won't use those handcuffs, and you'll wait for this lady's daughter to come back before you make any decisions. The law is a good thing, but you need humanity to apply it as well.
'''Roger''': Well- I promise, Ladybug.
'''Ticket Inspector''': What do you mean, Roger?
'''Roger''': She's right!
''()''
'''Ticket Inspector''': Uh- say there, you're not gonna get akumatized again, are you? ''(Sabine groans)''
'''Marinette''': Mom! I've been looking for you everywhere! Happy mother's day, mom! I'm a bit late, I know! ''(laughs nervously)'' But I- I just had so much work recently, but someday i'll manage to handle it all just like you. ''(hugs to Sabine)''
'''Sabine''': I know, darling.
'''Marinette''': Here are our tickets! I ran into Ladybug she explained the problem to me.
'''Roger''': So? ''()'' 
'''Ticket Inspector''': There, they're valid. ''(Sabine groans)'' You weren't lying.
'''Roger''': Does this mean we can cancel the fine and the id check?
'''Ticket Inspector''': Well, that doesn't change the fact that this lady was on the bus without a ticket! The situation is a bit complex. But I guess that- yes it would be reasonable to cancel it all.
'''Marinette''': The truth is- I was out of line too. ''(to Sabine)'' I am so- so sorry, mom. This is all my fault. which is why I'd like to pay the fine with my pocket money.
'''Ticket Inspector''': That's quite a responsible act young, lady? ''()''
'''Marinette''': ''(laughs nervously)'' Just for now could you lend me? Please?
