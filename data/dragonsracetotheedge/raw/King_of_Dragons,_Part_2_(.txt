''(Back to where the events started in [[King of Dragons, Part 2]]. In this part, we see [[Dragon Hunters]] and [[Dragon Flyers]] attack the [[Berserker Island]].)''

'''Berserker Soldier 1:''' [[Dragon Flyers]]! On the horizon!

'''[[Dagur the Deranged|Dagur]]:''' Train your catapults and arrows on the ships behind the Flyers and wait for my signal to fire!

'''Berserker Soldier 2:''' Dagur, are you crazy?

'''Dagur:''' That's been established. Just trust me!

'''Dragon Flyer:''' On the starboard side!

'''Dagur:''' Come on, Krogan. You know you want some of this. Bring it in for the real thing, big boy.

'''[[Krogan]]:''' Huh? Dragon! What is wrong with you?

'''Dagur:''' Now! Fire!

'''[[Krogan]]:''' Get over that island.

'''[[Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (Franchise)|Hiccup]]:''' Krogan, this ends now!

'''[[Ruffnut Thorston|Ruffnut]]''' Yeah! How do you like us now, Krogey?

'''[[Tuffnut Thorston|Tuffnut]]:''' Here's a little singe to go along with that tail.

'''[[Heather]]:''' I don't understand why we're being attacked. I thought they were looking for the King of Dragons.

'''Hiccup:''' They are.

'''Heather:''' ''(shocked)'' Here?

'''Hiccup:''' And I'm guessing it's beneath the island. That's why dragons can't fly here.

'''[[Fishlegs Ingerman|Fishlegs]]:''' It's his defense mechanism.

'''Hiccup:''' Exactly. He has the ability to control the minds of other dragons.

'''[[Astrid Hofferson|Astrid]]:''' Well, no wonder Krogan and [[Johann]] want him so badly.

'''Dagur:''' The King of Dragons is a Berserker. Ha! It makes perfect sense to me. I mean, what else would he be?

'''Tuffnut:''' [[Fenris Thorston|Uncle Fenris]], that's what. It must be him.

'''Dagur:''' ''(Hiccup and Astrid look on in annoyance)'' What are you talking about? What are they talking about?

'''Tuffnut:''' Well, our great-uncle on our mother's side...

'''Ruffnut:''' Fenris Thorston.

'''Tuffnut:''' Fenrisulfr Thorston, to be exact, went missing when we were kids. His name literally means "down below". "Fenris, Fenris, tall and fair, who did you let braid your hair?" That was the poem we youngsters used to recite to him. And Fenris would reply, "Hair. Mouth. Cheese of yak. Come, Sintar. Bring the melon."

'''Astrid:''' ''(furious)'' Can I ask a question? What's wrong with the two of you?

'''Ruffnut:''' Where would you like to begin?

'''Astrid:''' Why do you make up these family members? It's not your Uncle Fenris under this island. It's the King of Dragons.

'''Tuffnut:''' Is that what you'd have us do? Take away our creative minds and be like the rest of you simpletons? Okay, fine. We'll try it your way. What do you think Johann's doing right now, sis?

'''Ruffnut:''' Uh, he probably sent a second fleet to attack from the south as the first fleet re-engages from the north.

'''Tuffnut:''' Why would you say such a thing?

'''Ruffnut:''' Because that's what they're doing. I mean, that is them, right?

'''Hiccup:''' What the...

'''Tuffnut:''' You see? You see what happens when we get real? Things get real.

'''Berserker Soldier:''' Get down!

'''Dagur:''' ''(to Snotlout)'' Look.

'''Dragon Hunter:''' Fire!

'''Dagur:''' Those are our people down there.

'''Heather:''' We'd rather die in battle than hide in shame.

''(Heather and Dagur take out their weapons with icy determination in their faces, with Dagur releasing his maniacal, but battle cry.)''

'''Hiccup:''' No one's hiding. And we're not gonna stay here either. But our chances of survival without dragons are extremely slim, to say the least.

'''[[Spitelout Jorgenson|Spitelout]]:''' ''(looking down at the battle)'' Aye. That it is. ''(Turns to Hiccup)'' A decision would be a good thing right about now.

'''Hiccup:''' ''(rubs his chin for second, then turns to the team)'' We need to stay calm.

'''Dagur:''' ''(objecting)'' No, we have to stay strong. ''(Furiously grabs Hiccup's hand)'' Fight.

''(The screeching is heard from the sky, and when Hiccup and Dagur look to the sky to investigate, to their surprise, [[Wingmaidens]] appear from the sky and attack the Dragon Hunters.)''

'''Tuffnut:''' ''(happily)'' Holy Razorwhip, baby.

'''Ruffnut:''' ''(happily)'' Wingnut!

'''[[Snotlout Jorgenson|Snotlout]]:''' ''(overjoyed of seeing [[Minden]])'' That's my girl!

'''[[Minden]]:''' Hey, that's Wingmaiden to you, Snotlout.

'''Astrid:''' Hiccup, how did they?

'''Hiccup:''' Sent a [[Terror Mail]] from [[Defenders of the Wing]] Island. Wasn't sure they'd get here in time.

'''Fishlegs:''' How can baby Razorwhips fly over the center of the island?

'''Hiccup:''' Maybe because their senses haven't fully developed, it helps offset the effects?

'''Dagur:''' Or maybe it's a window for our dragons.

'''Astrid:''' Only one way to find out.

'''Hiccup:''' Astrid, listen.

'''Astrid:''' I'll be fine. We'll be fine. Johann and Krogan have probably gotten a head start. You and Toothless need to find the King of Dragons before they do and get him to safety. If not, this war will go on forever. Hey. Your dad would be so proud of you right now. I know I am. ''(Hiccup and Astrid share an affectionate kiss and Astrid runs off to the Dragon Riders.)'' All right, Dragon Riders! Get ready to fight like you've never fought before! This is our time! This is where we shine!

'''Hiccup:''' It's you and me now, bud. Let's do this.

''(Meanwhile, we see [[Johann]], Krogan and some of the Dragon Hunters head to the cave, looking for the King of Dragons. The villains eventually stop, upon noticing fog and what it appears to be a dead end.)''

'''[[Johann]]:''' ''(unimpressed)'' Dead end.

''(Suspicious, Krogan touches the "dead end" and hears its growling. Krogan smiles.)''

'''Krogan:''' Look again.

''(Suddenly, the wind blows up, and when the fog scatters, King of Dragons reveals himself. The King of Dragons is revealed to be a very large, white [[Berserker Bewilderbeast]] and the king is sleeping. Johann, who covered his face from the fog, looks up to the King and becomes completely bewildered and shocked by what he sees.)''

'''Johann:''' ''(to himself; shocked)'' Thor's hammer! We're gonna need a bigger cage. ''(Suddenly, the King wakes up with his eyes slid open and Johann notices him waking up and turns to Krogan)'' We must do something, Krogan. We cannot let it get away!

'''Krogan:''' It's not going anywhere. Trust me.

'''Johann:''' The spears! Use the spears! Now!

''(The hunters throw their spears at the large Bewilderbeast, angering the king. The enraged King lets out ferocious roar and one of the hunters runs away in fear.)''

'''Krogan:''' Try your luck with him, or resign your fate to me.

'''Dragon Hunter 1:''' Fire!

'''Dragon Hunter 2:''' Away!

'''Dragon Hunter 3:''' Fire!

'''Astrid:''' Dagur, Heather, Ruff, and, Tuff, engage with the Wingmaidens. Full frontal attack.

'''Dagur:''' A little engagement for our engagement. I like it.

'''Tuffnut:''' Nothing like a full frontal attack to kick the day into high gear.

'''Ruffnut:''' I'm with you, brother!

'''Heather:''' And I'm with you, brother.

'''Astrid:''' Spitelout, Snotlout, you two outflank them on the northern side, then squeeze. Got it?

'''Snotlout:''' ''(happily smiles)'' Oh, we'll squeeze 'em, all right.

'''Spitelout:''' ''(also happily smiles)'' Like a ripe tomato under me armpit.

'''Snotlout:''' ''(touched)'' Hey, Dad, it's fun to be doing this with you.

'''Spitelout:''' Took the words right out of my mouth, boyo. Couldn't be happier to be your wingman!

'''Astrid:''' Fishlegs, you're with me.

'''Dragon Hunter 1:''' Watch out!

'''Dragon Hunter 2:''' Fire!

'''Krogan:''' Don't let up.

'''Johann:''' You knew it was going to do that. Get to work on that ice. We need to break through. You and I will look for another path. I'm not letting you out of my sight.

'''Hiccup:''' Toothless! It's okay, bud. Just find another way around. Whoa. Oh, my Thor. The King of Dragons has laid an egg?

''(Hiccup drops his sword and shield, and when the future chieftain is about to grab the egg, he was confronted by the unexpected guests.)''

'''Johann:''' I see there are eggs on the menu. Who knew? 

''(Johann laughs, then his face turns evil. Dramatic music plays as Hiccup takes out his fiery sword and shield to defensive (on egg) and offensive (on Johann and Krogan). Noticing his threat, Krogan gives Hiccup the menacing look and separates from Johann and three-some prepare to fight. There's a long silence, and Krogan's running towards Hiccup breaks the silence and Johann follows back. Hiccup activates the ropes that tangled the groaning Krogan. Hiccup is about to grab the egg, but he was tackled by furious Johann. The former trader savagely punches Hiccup three times, and when he finally has him beaten, he unleashes his dagger from his sleeve to kill Hiccup. Hiccup looks up and lets out a stunning gasp as Johann prepares to stab him with it, but as soon as Johann prepared to strike, Hiccup quickly evades it and punches Johann, who dazedly staggers, then Hiccup furiously uses his kick to pin Johann down, knocking him out cold. After standing up and panting from hard fight, Hiccup goes to take the dragon egg, but Krogan has freed himself from ropes and threw it at the egg, which scatters to the cliff.)''

'''Hiccup:''' Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

'''Johann:''' Funny. This reminds me of the time I was on a glacier on the Southern-

'''Spitelout:''' It's go time, dragons!

'''Snotlout:''' Flyers coming in hot, people.

'''Fishlegs:''' Astrid!

'''Astrid:''' I know, Fishlegs. But we're staying and fighting.

'''Hiccup:''' Think, Hiccup. Think, think, think. Oh!

'''Johann:''' Bravo, Master Hiccup! I didn't know you had that in you. You must see the delicious irony of your situation, Hiccup. The final resting place of the champion of dragons will reside in the King of Dragons' birth nest. Sheer poetry. Aah!

'''Hiccup:''' Good job, bud. I knew you'd find me.

'''Johann:''' Easy, dragon. Whoa!

'''Hiccup:''' Krogan! Toothless, no. Go after the egg.

'''Johann:''' By all means, dragon. Off you go! After the egg!

'''Hiccup:''' Toothless, go. Protect that egg. I'll be fine. It's okay, bud. Go. Go!

''(Although reluctant, Toothless obeys his owner and flies off, leaving Johann to glare at Hiccup.)''

'''Johann:''' ''(impressed)'' Such heroism. And for what? ''(furious)'' For what?! 

''(In his rage, Johann kicks Hiccup down.)''

'''Hiccup:''' Aah! You don't have to do this, Johann.

'''Johann:''' ''(malicioussly)'' Oh, yes. Yes, I do, Hiccup.

''(Before Hiccup can meet his end, The King of Dragons saves Hiccup and blasts Johann with his icy breath, causing Hiccup and Johann to scream.)''

'''Hiccup:''' No!

''(Once the breath stops, Hiccup looks down and notices ice on his back and when he turns around, the ice cracks. Hiccup watches at the King of Dragons, who growls silently. Hiccup was surprised, but when he turns around, he sees frozen (and killed) Johann, still lifting the spear and giving a furious/hateful face. Baffled by Johann's apparent death, Hiccup tries to get back up there, but his sword is sliced off by the ice and falls into the hole, but hangs on.)''

'''Astrid:''' That must be the King of Dragons! What the? Garff!

'''Heather:''' Fishlegs, where did all these dragons come from?

'''Fishlegs:''' That roar must have been a distress signal. All available dragons.

'''Dragon Hunter:''' Dragons incoming!

'''Astrid:''' All right, everyone! Work with each other and the other dragons. Let's finish this.

'''Snotlout:''' Let her go. She's mine!

'''Fishlegs:''' Dream on. I was here first.

'''Ruffnut:''' Calm down, you two. There's plenty of this to go around.

'''Fishlegs:''' Ooh-hoo-hoo!

'''Spitelout:''' Yes!

'''Tuffnut:''' Go, Titan. Go, Singey. Go, Titan. Go, Singey.

'''Hiccup:''' Toothless! Oh, thank Thor. 

''(Hiccup grabs onto Toothless' tail and Toothless lifts him up. Hiccup notices frozen Johann, and was saddened by his death, indicating he still cares, despite everything he put him through and was remorseful that he couldn't help him. Toothless comforts him.)''

'''Hiccup:''' You never cease to amaze me, bud. You know that, right?

'''Fishlegs:''' Oh! Oh, my Thor. Is that the King of Dragons' egg? Hiccup, what did the King of Dragons look like?

'''Hiccup:''' I never even saw it, but it saved me. It saved us all.

'''Tuffnut:''' What about Fenris? Did he help?

'''Ruffnut:''' This has his fingerprints all over it.

'''Hiccup:''' Uh, sure. Why not? Oh, wait. Uh, where's Krogan? You guys have him, right?

'''Astrid:''' ''(sadly)'' No. We thought you had him.

'''Fishlegs:''' ''(puts his hand on Hiccup's shoulder)'' Hiccup, the King of Dragons is safe.
That's all that matters.

''(Somewhere, Krogan is takenby Dragon Flyers to [[Drago Bludvist]].)''

'''Krogan:''' ''(scared)'' Sir, I can explain.

'''[[Drago Bludvist]]:''' ''(grumpily and furiously)'' I don't want excuses! I want the King of Dragons!

'''Krogan:''' ''(scared)'' I found one, Drago! I did! Hiding under an island in a cavern of ice.

'''Drago:''' ''(annoyed)'' Get to the point!

'''Krogan:''' It got away... 

''(Drago lets out a sadistic chuckle, raises his fist over his neck and makes a signal, which indicates he wants Krogan to be executed as a punishment for his failures.)''

'''Krogan:''' ''(fearfully)'' Wait. Drago, please. I will not fail you again.

'''Drago:''' No one fails me twice.

'''Krogan:''' No, no, no, no, no.

'''Drago:''' Bring me my maps! I'll find another King of Dragons myself.

'''Hiccup [v.o.]:''' This is Dragon's Edge. It's remote, it's dangerous, and until recently, it's been our home. It's also been a home to our dragons. As far as the egg goes, Atali and the Wingmaidens knew someone who knew [[Valka|someone]] who had a safe place to keep it. With Johann out of the picture it will remain safe. As for the lovebirds... No, those lovebirds. Their future seems to be pretty certain. Apparently, that also sparked some new romance. Which should be interesting. (Snotlout opens his eyes and startles as Tuffnut glares and shakes his head in disagreement.) My dad pulled through and is back to his old self. Turns out he wasn't quite ready to give up being chief. I still have a feeling that won't stop him from trying to hand the reins over to me sometime very soon. As for the Dragon Eyes, they are such amazing tools for dragon knowledge, but in the wrong hands, they are just too dangerous. Yes, the Edge has been good for us. We are older, stronger, braver, and, in some cases, wiser.

'''Snotlout:''' What? I am not leaving this "S" behind.

'''Hiccup [v.o]:''' Like I said, in '''some''' cases. We return to Berk ready for anything, ready for anyone, ready to fight for our dragons, and they are ready to fight for us.

'''Hiccup:''' Who wants to race back to Berk?

'''Ruffnut:''' What?

'''Snotlout:''' Yes!
