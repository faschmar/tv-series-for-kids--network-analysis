Hiccup::: All right, either you come out, or we're coming in.
Hiccup::: Tuffnut?
Gruffnut::: Uh, Gruffnut, actually. And, uh, could you get your dragon to put me down?  You know, Toothless, uh, that is a terrible name for this dragon.
Hiccup::: Gruffnut, why are you coming to the Edge? What's the scam this time?
Gruffnut::: Whoa, whoa, sorry about what happened last time, okay? I was in hot water with some dangerous Vik -  Oh, yeah! I mean, I've changed. My time on Dark Deep forced me to re-evaluate my entire life. I'm a whole new Nut, a better Nut, an honest, more trustworthy Nut. I even have a job. 
Hiccup::: That's the Thorston family seal.
Hiccup::: What is this?
Gruffnut::: It's a message for Cousin Ruffnut and Cousin Tuffnut. I got to give it to them immediately.
Hiccup::: Hmm.
Fishlegs::: And . . . perfect. Ta-da! What do you think?
Tuffnut::: Fishlegs, this is our nineteenth-birthday soiree, okay? So that's the biggest, the best. It's gonna be the most incredible soiree in the history of Dragon's Edge! Odin will weep in the halls of Valhalla when he finds out he missed it. Not that we didn't invite the big guy.
Ruffnut::: Yeah, these accouterments, although somewhat festive and moderately well conceptualized, are not in line with the epic barn burner we've envisioned.
Tuffnut::: You need to go back, Fishlegs. Just go back to where this wasn't even something we were thinking about and then rethink your whole theme.
Fishlegs::: The whole theme?
Ruffnut::: The whole theme.
Fishlegs:::  Oh!  It's okay, girl. I thought your decorations were perfect. 
Tuffnut::: Where are the meat pies? Where are the meat pies?!
Snotlout:::  Huh? Oh, yeah, I was gonna make them, but then I remembered that I don't care about your stupid party. Now go away. I'm sleepy.
Ruffnut::: Ugh!
Snotlout::: Hey!
Tuffnut::: You've been officially uninvited.
Snotlout::: Like I wanted to go to your boring, pie-less banquet. Come on, Hookfang.
Tuffnut::: Okay, where's Astrid? Because we've got changes to make to the guest list.  Wait a minute. Who invited him?
Ruffnut::: Hey! If you came here to ruin our party, you might as well forget it.
Gruffnut::: No, no, no. You've got me all wrong, Ruff. See, I've got something very important to tell you. I've been sent here to administer the Thorston Induction Trials.  Rawr. 
Hiccup::: And you expect us to buy that?
Tuffnut::: Stand down, T.
Hiccup::: Wait. You actually believe him?
Tuffnut::: Of course I believe him. Hiccup, we've been waiting our whole lives for this.
Snotlout::: What kind of ridiculous clan has their coming-of-age ritual at nineteen? The Jorgensons do it at nine months, and we have to kill a bear.
Ruffnut::: Most Thorstons don't have that long of a lifespan, so if you actually make it to nineteen, it's a pretty big deal.
Tuffnut::: Yeah, and because of this, every Thorston, on their nineteenth birthday, must complete three extremely dangerous challenges. Each is specifically designed by the High Council of Thorstons to test the mental, physical, and height limits of the Thorston taking the Trials. Once completed, you're officially inducted into the clan, with all of the rights, benefits, and costumery that go along with it.
Fishlegs::: And every Thorston does this?
Tuffnut::: Every. Single. Thorston.
Tuffnut ::: Wait a second. What are we doing here reminiscing? We must prepare. There are so many things we have to get ready.
Hiccup::: Guys, are you absolutely sure this is real?
Ruffnut::: Look, I appreciate the concern, Haddock, and I admit Gruffnut's a slimy, two-bit scam artist but you can't argue with the scroll.
Hiccup::: I really don't like this.
Hiccup ::: So, if Gruffnut told you to jump off a cliff just because it's in the Trials, would you jump off a cliff?
Tuffnut::: I mean, how high is the cliff?
Hiccup::: Seriously, don't do this.
Ruffnut::: It's our birthright.
Tuffnut::: Besides, if we don't do the Induction Trials, we'll be disowned by the whole Thorston Clan.
Ruffnut::: Viewed as failures.
Hiccup::: But...
Ruffnut::: Ugh, Hiccup, it's so sweet and very Hiccup-like that you care, but relax. We've got something no other Thorston has ever had.
Hiccup::: And that is?
Ruffnut::: Barf and Belch.
Gruffnut::: Uh, ooh. Sorry. Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but uh, you actually can't use your dragon.
Ruffnut::: Hmm. Well, at least we have each other.
Gruffnut::: Uh, and that's problemo n√∫mero dos. You got to compete as individuals.
Ruffnut::: What? What are you babbling on about, Gruffnut?
Gruffnut::: There's only one spot available this year. Only one of you can become a full-fledged Thorston.
Hiccup::: You have to be kidding me.
Tuffnut::: What? But we're a package deal! You want Ruff, you get Tuff. Look, you can't have one without the other.
Gruffnut::: I'm sorry. We've just never had to deal with the whole twin 'thang'. For this, we had to devise a whole new system.
Ruffnut::: I'll give you a new system!
Tuffnut::: Ruff!
Ruffnut:::  Let me go!
Tuffnut::: Listen, Gruffnut, if that really is your name - I'm pretty sure it is because no one's referred to you as anything else - if we both can't become Thorstons, then count me out.
Ruffnut::: Yeah! I'm not gonna leave my brother behind.
Tuffnut::: Yes. Thank you, Ruffnut. You know, also, that being said, it's probably borne of insecurity knowing that, to be fair, I would win the Trials.
Ruffnut::: Oh, really? You don't say.
Hiccup::: Hey, uh, guys, let's not lose sight of the fact that you're both doing something really honorable.
Tuffnut::: Our fellow non-Thorston is right. We've made our decision. I'm afraid we shall be Thorstons no more. 
Ruffnut::: What the - Gruff?
Gruffnut::: Oh, so, I-I . . .  Look, I was wondering if you might reconsider taking the Trials.
Ruffnut::: We said no, and we meant it.
Gruffnut::: Which is so disappointing. I mean, it's clear you would've won.
Ruffnut::: Pfft. Duh.
Gruffnut::: I get it. A beauty like you will easily marry into another family. It's not as if you're going to become an old maid or, uh, you know, some elderly hen, a baby seal named Derriq, with a Q. But losing the Thorston name isn't such a big deal for you. But poor-poor Tuffnut - I mean, he's stuck.
Ruffnut::: Huh, I never thought of it that way.
Gruffnut::: Yep. An outcast forever. Sad and alone.  Unless . . .
Ruffnut::: Unless what?
Gruffnut::: Well, the rules say the winner earns the right to join the clan. Not that they have to.
Ruffnut::: Okay, so what's your point?
Gruffnut::: The point is, you could win the Trials and then gift the Thorston name to Tuff.
Ruffnut::: I could do that?
Gruffnut::: Of course. All of this is just made-up customs and traditions from our - We don't even know why we do this stuff.
Ruffnut::: Huh. Okay. I'll do it. When do we start?
Gruffnut::: How about now? Challenge one. It's simple, really. Just fill this with Speed Stinger venom.
Ruffnut::: Hmm.
Tuffnut::: 'Course, I would ace the Trials. You know, Ruffnut probably wouldn't complete the first challenge. Hey! Keep your knees up! That's it, little chick-ly. But, Ruff and I agreed we're not gonna do the Trials. So I'm just in training mode.
Gruffnut::: I understand. You're a Dragon Rider, an adventurer. You don't need to be tied down by clans or titles or subtitles. You're your own man.
Tuffnut::: So true, cousin, so true.
Gruffnut::: It's your sister.
Gruffnut ::: That's who I feel sorry for.
Tuffnut::: Sorry for her? Why?
Gruffnut::: Well, I mean, two failed romances. Now no name, no dowry. She'll be alone forever. It's gotta be so hard.
Tuffnut::: Yeah, I hadn't thought of that. But I mean, what can I do?
Gruffnut::: Here's what I was thinking . . . 
Gruffnut ::: Uh, you know, you didn't have to come with me. I can referee the Trials by myself.
Hiccup::: I have no clue how you talked them back into this, but I'm gonna make sure they don't get themselves killed.
Gruffnut::: That's - That is so unnecessary. They'll be fine.
Hiccup::: So you're telling me there's no way they get hurt?
Gruffnut::: If you're looking for a guarantee, then we gotta start talking about what is a guarantee?
Hiccup::: Oh, never mind.
Ruffnut::: Argh!
Tuffnut::: Come here. Come here! Argh!
Ruffnut/Tuffnut::: What are you doing here?
Ruffnut::: Nothing. Not a thing.
Tuffnut::: You're trying to milk a Speed Stinger's tail for its venom!
Ruffnut::: Mmmmaybe . . .
Tuffnut::: I knew it. You're taking the Induction Trials.
Ruffnut::: How did you know that was the first Trial?
Tuffnut::: O-uh . . .
Ruffnut::: You're taking them, too!
Tuffnut::: Yes. But for a very good reason.
Ruffnut::: We agreed we weren't going to do this if we both couldn't get in.
Tuffnut::: While that is technically true . . .
Ruffnut::: Obviously, you were just saying that to keep me from doing them. You knew you couldn't beat me.
Tuffnut::: No, no, no. It was because there was no way you'd beat me. I didn't want to embarrass you.
Ruffnut::: Oh, yeah?
Tuffnut::: Yeah!
Ruffnut::: Well, there's only one way to find out.
Ruffnut/Tuffnut::: May the best Nut win!
Tuffnut::: Which obviously will be me. See you at the finish line, loser.
Ruffnut::: Oh, you'll see me there, waiting for you to arrive in last place!
Tuffnut::: Well, you'll be waiting a long time, because I'll have gotten there before you, and I'll have taken a nap in a hammock, while you're toiling and struggling to finish the Trials. Ha!
Ruffnut::: Ya finished?
Tuffnut::: And then, once I woke up again, I would, uh, go and get the book and put it on my chest and fall back asleep so that if I woke up a third time, I could read. Yes, now I'm finished.
Tuffnut ::: She-beast!
Ruffnut::: I've got you now. The Thorston name is mine. Oh, yes.
Ruffnut::: Tuffnut's got nothing on me. Ha!
Tuffnut:::  Ah!  Paralysis . . . spreading. What a cruel twist of fate.  Ah. Ah! Oh, no!  I can still feel my foot. It hasn't spread to my mouth. 
Hiccup/Gruffnut::: Tuffnut!
Hiccup::: And I suppose helping's against the rules, is it?
Gruffnut::: Yeah, of course, but you know, let's say I was looking in the other direction while you accidentally fired a blast in that general direction . . .
Tuffnut::: See you, sucker! 
Ruffnut::: Whoo! Yeah! Passed the first Trial. And where's Tuffnut? Oh, that's right. He's nowhere to be found. 
Ruffnut::: Hey, bro. You know you can always back out.
Tuffnut::: Blah.
Ruffnut::: Ugh!
Gruffnut::: Congratulations. You've both completed the first Trial. What a proud moment!
Ruffnut::: Good for you, Tuffnut.
Tuffnut::: You know, I'd applaud for you sarcastically right now if I could move my hands.
Ruffnut::: What do you want us to do with these? Huh? Drink 'em? 'Cause I will, I'll drink 'em.
Hiccup::: Oh, Thor, no!
Gruffnut::: You might need them for challenge two. To pass this challenge, you must obtain one molted Changewing skin.
Ruffnut:::  Piece of cake.  Uh - Oh! Okay, look, I'm only here for the skin.  What do you say you just give it to me?  Aah!  Oh, this won't hurt a bit.  Ha!
Tuffnut:::  Seriously? I can't believe my luck!  Oh. Oh, no. Seriously? I can't believe my luck.  Bam!
Ruffnut::: Ruffnut wins again!  Yeah!  The crowd goes wild! How does she keep doing it, folks? I don't know! She must be a genius.
Tuffnut::: Don't speak too soon, sis.
Ruffnut::: Oh, come on! You got lucky.
Tuffnut::: Luck? Ha. That was all skill. You're just going to have to accept that I am going to be the real Thorston.
Ruffnut::: If you want the Thorston name, you're gonna have to take it from me.
Tuffnut::: Argh!
Hiccup::: Hey, hey, let's not forget that you're brother and sister.
Tuffnut::: Unless you want to adopt the loser, stay out of this! Although Ruffnut Haddock does sound sort of good.
Ruffnut::: And to think I was ever gonna . . .
Tuffnut::: Gonna what?
Ruffnut:::  Never mind.
Gruffnut::: Calm down, you two. You need to prepare yourselves for the most difficult challenge of all: challenge three. I'll give you one hint. You might want to take that Changewing skin with you. 
Gruffnut ::: Hidden within this network of tunnels is an old chest. The first one to bring it to me will become the official Thorston.
Tuffnut::: Only one of us can win this time. So good luck, old maid.
Ruffnut::: Get ready to start your new life, Tuffnut Haddock. And . . . go!
Ruffnut ::: What?! Oh!  Sweet.  Titan Wing Zippleback.  Okay, got to use the skin. Use the skin . . .  Whoa. I can't breathe.  Uh . . . 
Ruffnut ::: Tuffnut!
Tuffnut::: Ruffnut!
Ruffnut::: Give me that chest!
Tuffnut::: No! It's mine.
Ruffnut::: Mine! I saw it first.
Tuffnut:::  I'm gonna be the real Thorston.
Ruffnut::: Never!
Tuffnut::: Aah!  Whoa. Oh, no.  Oh, come on. Seriously?  Aah! Oh! Help! Oh, no. No, no. Stop! Aah! Aah! 
Ruffnut:::  What have I done?  I've won! That's what! Oh, yeah. I won.
Ruffnut ::: ‚ô™ I win, I win. All you Thorstons, let me in, let me in, yeah ‚ô™  Ugh, what's the point of winning alone? Being a Thorston means nothing without him. We are one Thorston. Ugh.
Gruffnut::: They should've been back by now.
Hiccup::: Okay, Gruffnut. Out with it. What are you not telling us?
Gruffnut::: What? I told you everything, I swear! Unless I forgot to mention the Titan Wing Zippleback nest?
Fishlegs:::  Do you have any idea how territorial Titan Wing Zipplebacks are? The twins are walking into a death trap!
Snotlout::: Ha-ha! Finally, some action!
Hiccup::: Everyone, to your dragons! We're getting Ruff and Tuff out of there.
Tuffnut:::  Aah! You know, you could've been gentler - Oh.  Oh, come on. Seriously?
Tuffnut ::: Well, this is it. This is the end of the line for the old Tuff-ster.  Eaten alive by Zipplebacks - that'll be on my tombstone. But the irony is searing a hole in my cranium at the mere thought. Why, Loki?! Why have you . . . ‚ô™ Forsaken me ‚ô™'<nowiki/>
Ruffnut:::  He hasn't.
Tuffnut::: Loki? Your voice is so much more feminine than I - Aah!
Tuffnut ::: What are you doing?
Ruffnut::: I'm saving you, you muttonhead.
Tuffnut:::  No! No, save yourself, all right? Take the chest. Become a real Thorston.
Ruffnut::: I'm not gonna leave you. Besides, you should be the real Thorston.
Tuffnut::: Ruffnut soon-to-be-Thorston, this was all for you. I wanted you to be the real Thorston. I didn't want you to become an old maid, some elderly hen. Some middle-aged cow!
Ruffnut::: And I didn't want you to be living in the street.
Ruffnut/Tuffnut::: I'm sorry.
Ruffnut::: Let's get out of here, together.
Tuffnut::: Yes, as a team, as brother and -
Ruffnut::: You know, this means neither of us are gonna be Thorstons.
Tuffnut::: I thought you were gonna say sis - You know what? Too bad, so sad. Let's go!
Ruffnut::: Shh.
Tuffnut::: I think it found us.
Ruffnut::: We gotta get him off our backs!
Tuffnut::: Uh-oh. 
Tuffnut::: Fire in the hole!
Ruffnut::: Go, go, go, go!
Astrid:::  This way!
Ruffnut::: At least we'll die together, bro.
Hiccup::: I just thought you could use a little help.
Ruffnut::: Barf!
Tuffnut::: Belch!
Tuffnut::: We missed you.
Hiccup::: Let's go, bud.
Tuffnut::: Gruffnut. We failed the Induction Trials.
Ruffnut::: There was no way I was gonna let my brother be Zippleback food.
Tuffnut::: And Maybe Ruffnut and I are no longer Thorstons, but we're still family. We're just a couple of Nuts.
Gruffnut::: Hang on to your hats. You two didn't fail.
Tuffnut::: It'll be hard, sure, but somehow we'll survive. We'll get a little hut somewhere with a bamboo divider in the middle . . . Wait, what, what do you mean?
Gruffnut::: You didn't fail. In fact, you completed the super-secret fourth Trial.
Ruffnut::: What fourth Trial? What are you talking about?
Gruffnut::: You see, you two thought only you could win the Trials, right? That‚Äôs a - That's a little fib. Something on my part that I fabricated.  It was a pretty fab fib. But in the end, you came together when you needed each other most. That was the final challenge - to see if you'll put family above everything else. That is the Thorston way. So I'll just take this back to Berk to verify that you passed the Trials,  and you will be official Thorstons. The Thorston Council will be in touch in the next few weeks about the ceremony. They're gonna be so excited.
Ruffnut::: Uh . . .
Gruffnut::: They'll be in touch. Few weeks, few months. You know how the Thorstons are about paperwork. So just excuse me. It was good seeing you all!
Hiccup::: Hang on. Just one second. What's in the chest, Gruff?
Gruffnut::: I d - I don't know. I have no idea. They don't tell me these things.
Hiccup::: Oh, really? Well, let's have a look, just for fun.
Ruffnut::: Wow. Way to ruin our moment.
Hiccup::: Wow. Uh, I'm sorry I doubted you, Gruff.
Gruffnut::: Like I said . . .  I'm a whole new Nut.
Tuffnut::: Cousin Agnut? What're you doing here, Agnut?
Agnut::: Your time has come to take the Induction Trials.
Ruffnut::: Uh, we already took them.
Tuffnut::: Yeah, Gruffnut administered them.
Ruffnut::: And we passed with flying colors.
Agnut::: Uh, Gruffnut? What does he have to do with anything? He has no authority to administer the Trials. No, no, no, no. He's never even completed them himself. He's not even a real Thorston! Not even close!
Hiccup::: So that means . . .
Gruffnut::: Now, what's this about the treasure I've read so much about?  What do we have here? Gold? Jewels? A medallion? Perhaps a bejeweled, golden medallion?  Great. As usual, worthless junk. I do all this for nothing but junk.  I come down here, make up this whole Induction Trials thing . . .
