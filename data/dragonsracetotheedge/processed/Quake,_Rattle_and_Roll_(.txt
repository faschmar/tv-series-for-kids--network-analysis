Hiccup::: All right. I think one more plasma blast should do the trick, bud.
Astrid::: Nice. I can see straight to the 
Hiccup::: I wonder how the twins' lookout tower is coming along.
Ruffnut::: Ah, yeah, oh.
Tuffnut::: Hey. Does something seem off to you?
Ruffnut::: Yeah. This should have fallen down a long time ago.
Tuffnut::: Maybe we actually did something... No, that's impossible.
Ruffnut::: Say it.
Tuffnut::: Something... right?
Ruffnut::: Ugh. I have a weird feeling inside. Is that accomplishment?
Tuffnut::: Whoa! I think I feel it, too. Quick! Let's go rub it in Hiccup's face before 
Fishlegs::: Hmm. Ooh. Wow. Very interesting.
Fishlegs::: Okay, girl, let's move on to rock experiment test subject number three... 
Snotlout::: Hey! What you doing, Fishlegs?
Fishlegs::: Oh, hey, Snotlout. Well, if you're asking me I'm testing how different rocks 
Snotlout::: Oh, that's right. I just remembered, you're boring and I don't care.
Fishlegs::: Yup! Couldn't have put it better myself, girl. Ooh, even more interesting.
Tuffnut::: Hiccup! Drop everything you're doing and bring your face.
Ruffnut::: Prepare to be rubbed.
Tuffnut::: Dragon Riders, you asked for it! We built it. Presenting you...
Ruffnut::: trumpet noise
Tuffnut::: With your new rock lookout tower!
Snotlout::: You guys never disappoint, do you?
Tuffnut::: What? No! Wait! It was here a minute ago! What did you do with it, Ruffnut?
Ruffnut::: I didn't do anything with it!
Tuffnut::: You lying she-beast! You were always jealous of my rock tower.
Ruffnut::: Your rock tower?! groaning
Tuffnut::: It was my rock tower!
Hiccup::: Okay, okay, okay. Let's everyone step away from the sharp objects. Okay, look, maybe this job was just too tough for you to do alone. I can always put Astrid on the project with you.
Astrid::: Uh. Hiccup, let's not be hasty.
Ruffnut::: But we did build it. Honest.
Tuffnut::: Trust me, H, no one was more surprised about that than we were.
Fishlegs::: Hiccup! Hiccup, come quickly!
Astrid::: That does not sound good.
Hiccup::: Fishlegs?
Fishlegs::: Careful where you step.
Hiccup::: Huh? Fishlegs, what's wrong?
Fishlegs::: Wrong? chuckles Nothing's wrong.
Hiccup::: Oh, Fishlegs, is that...
Fishlegs::: The ancestral home of all the Gronckles.
Fishlegs::: It's real, Hiccup. And we finally found it.
Snotlout::: Yeah. What's so great about this?
Fishlegs::: Do I really have to explain?
Snotlout::: Your boring discovery? Yes.
Fishlegs::: Dark Deep is an island that, up until now, we were never really sure existed.
Snotlout::: plop Check that! I absolutely don't care.
Fishlegs::: Hiccup? I've taken the liberty of charting a course based on these encryptions.
Hiccup::: Okay. I get it, Fishlegs.
Fishlegs::: Okay, you can come, too.
Hiccup::: Okay, I promise.
Fishlegs::: Well, then welcome aboard, Hiccup.
Fishlegs::: Come on, Meatlug, we need to go pack!
Hiccup::: Uh, Ruff, Tuff?
Hiccup::: Hey, great! Well, I should have a look at it then, shouldn't I?
Tuffnut::: Get ready to feast your eyes.
Hiccup::: Okay, so what should my eyes be feasting on, exactly?
Tuffnut::: Well, the tower... Oh, come on!
Tuffnut::: No, that's it. Left of the chicken. Hi, chicken.
<strong>Ruffnut</strong>::: Yeah. You're all a bag of liars.
Hiccup::: laughs Fishlegs, I haven't seen you this excited since Snoggletog morning when we were seven.
Fishlegs::: Whoo-hoo! I know. I couldn't even finish third breakfast.
Fishlegs::: I hope I don't get too hungry.
<strong>Fishlegs</strong>::: Dark Deep, here we come.
Fishlegs::: Whoo!
Fishlegs::: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, Fishlegs! giggles
Fishlegs::: I can't believe I'm actually here.
Fishlegs::: Sorry, girl. We're here.
Fishlegs::: ♪ Dark Deep is your home ♪
Fishlegs::: ♪ Where Gronckles have fun ♪
Fishlegs::: clears throat I'll work on that last part, Hiccup.
Hiccup::: Hey, no look, I love the song. It's just one thing.
Hiccup::: Where are the roaming Gronckles?
Hiccup::: You think, we could've landed on the wrong...
Fishlegs::: No. That's Gravel Lake and that's definitely the dual peaks of Mount Grunt. 
Hiccup::: Yeah, I'm with you, bud.
Fishlegs::: Oh, look. Meatlug found some new friends.
Fishlegs::: Told you there were Gronckles here.
Hiccup::: That's strange behavior for a Gronckle.
Fishlegs::: That could be what's doing it. No one likes an earthquake.
Hiccup::: Hey, Fishlegs? When was the last time you saw a boulder roll uphill?
Fishlegs::: Um... never?
<strong>Hiccup</strong>::: Quick, down here.
FIshlegs::: What? That's what happens when you don't eat third breakfast.
Fishlegs::: Impressive. Definitely a Boulder Class.
Fishlegs::: Hiccup, what you you think of Catastrophic Quaken as the name?
Hiccup::: Well I think, we should name it later and focus on not getting killed by it now.
Hiccup::: As long as it's rolled up in that ball, I think we're safe.
Hiccup::: Fishlegs, get those Gronckles in the air.
Hiccup::: Okay, on second thought, maybe we're not so safe after all.
Hiccup::: Fishlegs, Meatlug, retreat.
Fishlegs::: I thought you'd never ask.
Snotlout::: Really? More Gronckles?
Hiccup::: Just a few stray Gronckles. We should be able to handle that.
Tuffnut::: Just a few strays, he says.
Astrid::: Yeah, you should really have a look at this.
Fishlegs::: The Catastrophic Quaken, to be exact.
Snotlout::: Quaken Shmaken.
Snotlout::: You let one lousy dragon take over Meatlug's entire island?
Fishlegs::: It's not that simple, Snotlout.
Snotlout::: Oh. Sure it is. Quaken, one. Meatlug buzzer sound pathetic.
<strong>Tuffnut</strong>::: Bad dragon!
Fishlegs::: Don't worry, girl. I'll figure out how to get those Gronckles back home. 
Snotlout::: ​​​​​​Sounds like someone has a problem that needs some solving.
Snotlout::: Well, consider this your lucky day, Fishlegs.
Snotlout::: Because the answer man has arrived.
Fishlegs::: Snotlout?
Snotlout::: That's right. And I'm going to help you get Dark Deep back for those 
Fishlegs::: You don't understand.
Snotlout::: Yeah. Look at me, then look at you. You're much bigger than me, right?
Fishlegs::: Yes.
Snotlout::: But your boot's untied.
Fishlegs::: Ah? Whoa!
Fishlegs::: Hey, my boot doesn't have laces!
Snotlout::: The only way to get rid of this Quaken and that is to push him off Dark 
​​​​​Snotlout::: And the only way to do that is to fight dirty.
Fishlegs::: Oh-oh. I don't think so.
Snotlout::: Fishlegs! Do you want to be you, or do you want to win?
Fishlegs::: I want to win, but not your way.
Snotlout::: Oh, you'll be back! They always come back!
Snotlout::: He'll be back.
Fishlegs::: Hey, what are you up to?
Hiccup::: Uh, just strengthening the iron in this tail piece. Toothless keeps bending it when he makes turns. Don't you, bud?
Hiccup::: So what's up?
Fishlegs::: I was just wondering what the plan was.
Fishlegs::: The plan?
Fishlegs::: For Dark Deep? The Quaken?
Fishlegs::: How are we gonna get rid of it?
Hiccup::: Oh, yeah. I've been thinking about that, Fishlegs.
Hiccup::: And I'm not so sure we should, get rid of it, that is.
Fishlegs::: What?
Hiccup::: Well, I'm not sure that we have the right to interfere.
Hiccup::: I mean, that's what happens in nature, all the time.
Hiccup::: The Quaken has taken over the island for now.
Hiccup::: And one day, maybe a bigger dragon will come along and the Quaken will be 
Hiccup::: I'm sorry, Fishlegs.
Fishlegs::: Come on!
Fishlegs::: Follow me, hurry, hurry! This way!
Fishlegs::: Come on! Keep up!
Snotlout::: What did I tell you? You'll be back.
Snotlout::: They always come back. laughs wickedly
Fishlegs::: yelling Nooo!
Fishlegs::: I can't believe I'm actually gonna say this, but teach me everything 
Snotlout::: You came back? Ahh!
Snotlout::: Of course he came back. chuckles I knew he would.
Snotlout::: Hookfang.
Fishlegs::: Um, let's just keep this between us, we don't wanna bother Hiccup with any of 
Snotlout::: I feel you on that. Now, it's time to get dirty.
Fishlegs::: Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm.
Snotlout::: The key to fighting dirty is never face your opponent.
Snotlout::: Look at the sky. Your boots. Anything but their eyes.
Fishlegs::: Then lower the boom when they least expect it!
Fishlegs::: Come on, girl.
Snotlout::: muffled Bull's-eye.
Snotlout::: Well, well, well, I didn't think it was possible... what with you 
Fishlegs::: Do you really think so?
<strong>Hiccup</strong>::: I knew you were up to something.
Hiccup::: Fishlegs, have you been training to take on the Quaken?
Snotlout::: You don't have to answer that.
Hiccup::: Oh, yes, he does. Fishlegs?
Fishlegs::: Fine. Yes, we have.
Fishlegs::: We can't just sit by and let the Quaken take over Dark Deep.
Fishlegs::: You all know the Gronckles can't stay here.
Fishlegs::: This isn't their home, Hiccup.
Fishlegs::: You wanna talk about nature, what's right and who belongs where?
Fishlegs::: The Dragon Eye, it says the Gronckles were supposed to live on Dark Deep and 
Fishlegs::: We're ready for it this time, Hiccup.
Fishlegs::: Look. Meatlug, battle ready!
Hiccup::: Battle ready? Whoa. Fishlegs, this isn't you, it's him.
Snotlout::: I know. Great, right?
Snotlout::: Hookfang!
Fishlegs::: But, Hiccup...
Hiccup::: You're right, Fishlegs.
Tuffnut::: Um, you didn't happen to see five -or twenty- wild Gronckles run through here by any chance?
Snotlout::: How could you lose twenty Gronckles?
Tuffnut::: I know, right?
Ruffnut::: Yeah. Out of rocks.
Ruffnut and Tuffnut::: Oh.
Snotlout::: Hey. Would you guys might give me a lift back to the clubhouse?
Fishlegs::: We'll give you a ride back, Snotlout. On one condition.
Snotlout::: You did the right thing, Fishlegs.
Fishlegs::: You said I did the right thing.
Snotlout::: Uh, yeah. That was before I saw it!
Fishlegs::: Hiccup was right. This isn't us.
Fishlegs::: But what other choice do we have?
Fishlegs::: For the Gronckles and Dark Deep!
Hiccup::: We need to find these muttonheads before they get themselves killed.
Astrid::: Look there! Muttonhead incoming!
Hiccup::: Snotlout! Where's Fishlegs?
Snotlout::: You know, that Quaken was a lot bigger than he said it was.
Hiccup::: So you just left him? Oh, my gods.
Snotlout::: Oh, fine! But my death is on your horns, Hookfang!
Fishlegs::: Oh, Thor! Oh, Thor!
<strong>Hiccup</strong>::: Fishlegs!
Fishlegs::: The Quaken's cave. It looks like he lives here by himself.
Fishlegs::: Meatlug, let's get out of here.
Fishlegs::: No. We aren't going anywhere, right, girl?
Fishlegs::: I'm not backing down, I'm not backing down, I'm not backing down.
Fishlegs::: I'm not smushed.
Fishlegs::: You were right, Hiccup. Fighting dirty isn't me.
Fishlegs::: Oh, really, Snotlout? Tell me more! Oh, yeah, that's right. I just remembered I don't care.
Snotlout::: I taught him too well.
