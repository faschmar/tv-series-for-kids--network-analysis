Gobber::: Are you sure you've got the recipe right?
Fishlegs::: Of course I'm sure, three parts limestone...
Snotlout::: WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!!!
Gobber::: Yeah, three parts limestone...
Fishlegs::: Uh-huh!
Hiccup::: Give it all you've got, bud.
Fishlegs::: Two parts sandstone...
Gobber::: Sandstone, check.
Fishlegs::: One part iron ore...uh-huh, a down low!
Gobber::: Yeah-heh...
Fishlegs::: And now...the secret ingredient...
Fishlegs::: One giant spoon of cooled and hardened Gronckle lava!
Gobber::: Gronckle lava, of course!
Fishlegs::: Voila! You have Gronckle Iron.
Astrid::: Alright, let's see how your Gronckle Iron holds up against a close-range spine shot.
Fishlegs::: Be our guest.
Astrid::: Stormfly, spines.
Tuffnut::: Giant, furry...
Tuffnut::: Teeth...
Hiccup::: Tuff, no!
Tuffnut::: Even...teeth were furry...
Tuffnut::: Thank Loki, you guys are not gonna believe what just happened to me, it was-
Tuffnut::: We'll talk in a little bit...
Tuffnut::: There I was: me, and my inner Nut.
Hiccup::: Tuff, what happened out there?
Tuffnut::: It was dark. So dark it, Hiccup. Not even the moon to light my merry way. And then all of a sudden, out of the darkness. Red eyes! Ferocious teeth! A growl that could peel the beak off a chicken!
Tuffnut::: Sorry, metaphor. It grabbed me, and tossed me around like a rag doll, a very handsome rag doll. And then, it left me for dead.
Fishlegs::: Tuffnut, can you tell us anything else about what attacked you?
Tuffnut::: It was far too fast, too...cagey, too...quick, give me another adjective!
Snotlout::: Ooh, how about, imaginary?
Tuffnut::: Laugh and guffaw, if you must, but would an imaginary beast give you one of THESE?
Fishlegs::: Ugh, there's nothing anywhere that matches this, the Book of Dragons, Bork's papers, even the Dragon Eye.
Gobber::: Hm, it won't be any of those.
Hiccup::: Gobber?
Gobber::: It's obvious we're all thinking the same thing.
Hiccup::: Well, I can pretty much guarantee we're not, but, uh, why don't you tell us what you're thinking, Gobber.
Gobber::: Lycanwing. The Lycanwing dragon is a rare beast, and a vicious one at that. Those who survive its bite are not actually survivors at all. They are doomed to a life as half-man, half-Lycanwing. At the height of every full moon, the condemned viking transforms into a terrifying ragon! Wings the size of a house, teeth stronger than Gronckle Iron! And a thirst...for blood.
Hiccup::: Tuff, the Lycanwing is a legend! It's not a real dragon! Gobber, have you ever seen a Lycanwing?
Gobber::: No...
Hiccup::: Has anyone on Berk ever seen a Lycanwing?
Gobber::: Not that I can recall.
Hiccup::: I rest my case.
Gobber::: But the stories...oooh! They'll straighten the hair on a curly-haired yak!
Gobber::: His name was Kessler.
Snotlout::: That's a weird name!
Gobber::: Weird kid. Bright red hair, eyes as black as night! Naughty as a Nadder in a chicken coop.
Tuffnut::: That's seriously naughty. Am I right? To Chicken. High-three!
Tuffnut::: Heh, nevermind.
Gobber::: One night, little Kessler, against his parents' wishes, went exploring in the forest. Days went by, no sign of him. Only a far away scream, coming from the woods. The little bugger never returned.
Gobber::: AHHH!!! Or did he?! Every year from then on, when little Kessler's birthday rolled around, a red, black-eyed dragon would fly over his parents' house and pluck one of their sheep right out of the paddock! The dragon would look back, taunting them. BUUUT I wouldn't worry, Tuffnut, you're not exhibiting any symptons.
Snotlout::: Hey, hey, hey, can we really say for sure what our pal Tuffnut is exhibiting? C'mon Gobster, lay em' on us! Just for the sake of argument.
Ruffnut::: I don't think that's a good idea, Snotlout.
Gobber::: Well first off, you'd be looking at sensitivity to light.
Snotlout::: Aren't you always that it hurts your head when you look into the sun?
Tuffnut::: Yeah...I did say that.
Tuffnut::: Ah!
Gobber::: Unquenchable thirst...
Snotlout::: You look thirsty...!
Ruffnut::: Hey! He always looks thirsty.
Snotlout::: What else, Gobber? There's gotta be more than that.
Gobber::: Fidgety arms, on account of the wings starting to sprout.
Ruffnut::: Owgh!
Ruffnut::: Watch it, would ya?
Tuffnut::: Geez, sorry. I'm fidgety...
Snotlout::: What else? What else?
Gobber::: Finally, the overwhelming desire to eat fresh fish.
Tuffnut::: Yeck, tastes terrible!
Snotlout::: Ahahaha! How awesome was that? What an idiot.
Ruffnut::: You have no idea what you've done.
Hiccup::: Uhhh...Tuffnut? What are you doing?
Tuffnut::: I give you Macey. Hold her dearly, she likes sitting by the window, looking at the moon...the full moon. Ha! The irony.
Snotlout sarcastically::: Oh my Thor. That's so thoughtful.
Tuffnut::: Fishlegs. I give you my favorite bowl. 
Fishlegs::: Hey, that's my bowl!
Tuffnut::: And now, now you've found it. Eat well, my friend. Eat well. Hiccup, Hiccup, Hiccup. What do you give the man who has everything. Here.
Ruffnut::: Hey, you can't give me away!
Tuffnut::: In time, she'll come to you. She's going to take this very hard, and will most certainly go through a prolonged morning period. She's gonna need a new twin brother. I nominate you. It's a terrible job and she smells horrible. You'll have to dress like me and grow your hair long, so there are perks.
Hiccup::: Alright, alright! What did I miss?
Tuffnut::: I'm just...preparing myself.
Astrid::: For what?
Tuffnut::: Astrid, have you seen that moon? It rises to its apex, which I think is a word that means the tip-top. I'm going full dragon, Tuffnut Lycanwing.
Snotlout::: Ahaha!
Tuffnut::: You're a funny guy, Snotlout. I'll eat you first...
Hiccup::: Tuff, we went over this. The Lycanwing is a myth, it's not real, you're not turning into a dragon! Fishlegs, will you please tell him?
Fishlegs::: Uhuhuh? Mmm...
Tuffnut::: Now, I must go and say my most difficult goodbye of all, if you'll excuse me.
Ruffnut::: What did I tell you? WHAT DID I TELL YOU?! YOU are gonna help me fix this, Snotlout! YOU HEAR ME?!
Snotlout::: Wow, they can really get riled up, huh?
Tuffnut::: Barf, Belch. My winged brothers! I'll see you in the friendly skies. Who knows, maybe we'll slide down a rainbow together.
Tuffnut::: OK, you ready?
Tuffnut::: Hm, this should work. Good view, got a good ventilation. Gotta keep the others safe from me, when I turn.
Tuffnut::: I feel you, my animal brother. Huh, my last night as me, for tomorrow, at this time, alas, I shall no longer be human. I will be Tuffnut, Lycanwing, Killing-Machine!
Gobber::: Well, I did my best. He's not talking to anyone but that chicken. And he's convince the moon didn't apex last night, so it must be tonight.
Tuffnut::: Talk to me, chicken. Talk to me. What did they say? What are they saying?
HIccup::: Well that's great.
Astrid::: Is that...?
Hiccup::: Ruffnut...flying Hookfang?
Astrid::: Where's Snotlout?
Gobber::: There he is. Big lump behind her. Tear-stained face.
Ruffnut::: Oh, rough one.
Hiccup::: What are you two doing? We could use you right about now.
Ruffnut::: We've been gathering samples?
Astrid::: Samples of what?
Hiccup::: Gah!
Ruffnut::: Dragon bites. One of these has to match Tuff's and convince him that this Lycanwing deal is just another one of his paranoid fantasies.
Hiccup::: Aaand...why is Snotlout...?
Ruffnut::: He started this stupid thing with his impressive yet sinister powers of suggestion. It's all Snotlout's fault my dopey brother thinks he's turning into a dragon.
Hiccup::: Well looks like you're in this one, Snotlout.
Ruffnut::: Not so funny now, is it?
Snotlout::: No, Ruffnut. Not funny at all.
Ruffnut::: Let's go, pal.
Fishlegs::: Hiccup, Hiccup! Oooh, you're not going to believe this! I was at my wit's end, trying to think of something, anything, that could help with this, when my perfect little angel crushed my desk, and look what I found!
Fishlegs::: It's the one you found in the caves with Gustav! I've been meaning to give it back to you, Hiccup. I'm usually not so irresponsible with priceless artifacts.
Hiccup::: Fishlegs, we have got to go see what's on it!
Tuffnut::: I'm telling you, it's not flat, it's gotta be round, or oblong, at the very least. Think about it. The moon, round. Sun, round. My head, oblong.
Ruffnut::: Uh...I hate to interrupt this fascinating debate, but...
Tuffnut::: Stand back, sis! It's not safe to be around me right now. I could go at any minute.
Ruffnut::: Yeah...whatever. Just hold out your arm we need to check something.
Snotlout::: Oh, for the love of Thor, do it. I'm pretty sure I need serious medical attention.
Tuffnut::: Whoa, what happened to you?
Snotlout::: Ask her.
Tuffnut::: What happened to him?
Ruffnut::: He's helping me find out what happened to you.
Tuffnut::: I think we all know what happened to me...
Snotlout::: Any day now!
Ruffnut::: Hold...still!
Ruffnut::: Well, we can cross Terrible Terror, Night Terror, Wild Nadder, and Gronckle off the list. Let's go.
Snotlout::: I'm not going anywhere with you! You're stark raving mad!
Ruffnut::: Let's go, I said!
Snotlout::: Ugh, okay okay okay I'm coming ow ow ow!
Snotlout::: This is the last one, and I'm officially paid back. And anyway, how was I supposed to know that he'd go this crazy?
Ruffnut::: What? Have you met my brother?
Snotlout::: Fine. Whatever! Man, I am so glad you're not my sister.
Ruffnut::: No. You wish I was your sister. You think I'd be dragging your monkey butt all over the jungle risking your life if my brother weren't the most important thing in the world to me? Think about that!
Tuffnut::: Haha, yeah!
Ruffnut::: Uh...
Tuffnut::: Whoa, awesome! I love the pus! What kind of bite is that?
Ruffnut::: Sea snake.
Snotlout muttering::: Oh, I don't feel so good...
Ruffnut::: Another no match.
Tuffnut::: Hey, aren't those things supposed to be poisonous?
Ruffnut::: Don't think so.
Tuffnut::: Nah, I'm pretty sure they are.
Ruffnut::: Nope, you're wrong!
Tuffnut::: I'm pretty sure I'm not.
Snotlout::: Oh guys, there's ever pus...
Tuffnut::: Ha! Told you. Do I know my sea snakes or what?
Tuffnut::: That is seriously creepy. Should we check his breathing?
Ruffnut::: Ehhh wimp.
Fishlegs::: Ugh, well that's it! That's every combination I can think of.
Hiccup::: Wait wait wait I see something! Let's try this. Toothless?
Hiccup::: Now am I crazy, or is that a man with dragon wings instead of arms?
Fishlegs::: You aren't crazy...and there he is again, with a tail to go with the wings. Hiccup?
HIccup::: Can you make out what this says?
Fishlegs::: No man shall tread on these shores lest he become what he is most feared. That must be Lycanwing Island.
Hiccup::: And that, my friend, is why we always listen to Gobber.
Fishlegs::: Hiccup, this Lycanwing, it could be, well, not a myth.
Hiccup::: That island's not far from here.
Fishlegs::: Why do I get the feeling we're going on a little Hiccup-Fishlegs recom mission?
Hiccup::: OK, Fishlegs. If we do happen to run across a Lycanwing, we need to have a really good plan.
Fishlegs::: How about, don't get bitten? That sounds like a good one to me.
Hiccup::: Yup, me too. OK. Lycanwing Island, here we come.
Tuffnut::: Lycanwing Island? OK, don't tell anyone, but I didn't actually believe it before, I was just trying to mess with their heads, you know, be quirky and eccentric, by giving away my stuff, and locking us in here. Plus, I get along with you. How could I know it would come to this? How could I know it was real?!
Tuffnut::: How could I know?! He growls. How could I know...
Hiccup::: OK, Toothless. Give us some light.
Hiccup::: Let's go, Fishlegs. Don't worry. I'll be right next to you the whole time.
Ruffnut::: Alright, this better match 'cause I don't know how much more he can take. Tuff? Do you see what I see, Snotlout?
Snotlout::: I don't know, I think I've gone blind from all the venom...
Ruffnut::: He's out, Tuffnut on the loose. This is bad...This is very bad...
Tuffnut::: I can't be contained, Chicken. Look at that moon. A matter of hours, it will finally apex, and I will be transformed, into a great scaly beast! With nothing to do but feast on my prey!
Tuffnut::: Oh! It's like all my senses are alive for the first time! I can feel things! See things! Hear things I've never been able to before! You know what I mean, Chicken?
Chicken::: Yes, Tuffnut. I understand.
Chicken::: What's the problem? I thought you wanted to converse with Chicken.
Tuffnut::: Ah...oh Chicken, I did! I've longed for this moment...
Chicken::: Mmm...
Tuffnut::: If only it could last forever. But only a fool lives his future in the past. Our time is short, Chicken. Come, our fate awaits.
Fishlegs::: Beware the beast. Turn back before you become him. Your fate is sealed! Did you hear that, Hiccup?! Our fate is sealed!
Hiccup::: Fishlegs, we're fine. It's just an old cave drawing. 
Fishlegs::: I can't believe we're gonna die chasing an imaginary dragon.
Fishlegs::: Hiccup? There it is! If I have to go girl, I'm glad it's with you.
Hiccup::: Alright, Toothless. Light. Look, it's eyes...
Fishlegs::: I am not looking into that thing's eyes, do you know me?!
Hiccup::: Fishlegs! Would you just look?
Fishlegs::: Hiccup, are those...?
Hiccup::: Dragon Eye lenses...
Hiccup::: Gobber, how's Tuff doing?
Gobber::: Hahaha. Gone. He and the Chicken flew the coop last night, said something about taking flight off the tallest cliff when he went full dragon.
Hiccup::: You didn't try to stop him?
Gobber::: I was a bit busy.
Fishlegs::: Doing what?
Gobber::: Extracting sea snake venom from Snotlout. You should have heard him. He sounded like a yak being turned inside out.
Hiccup::: Well, we better go tell Ruffnut.
Gobber::: Gone too. Went to go look for her brother. She seemed to think whether he was a dragon or not he wouldn't survive the flight. Dragged Snotlout with her. Personally, I'm surprised he made the trip. The boy's not looking so well.
Snotlout::: I don't know if Gobber got it all. He burps. I'm starting to feel a little woozy, and all I see is fog.
Ruffnut::: It's foggy, you muttonhead. Hurry up, Snotlout, before Tuffnut jumps off a cliff or something!
Snotlout::: You think he needs a full Lycanwing to remember all the nasty stuff I said to him?
Ruffnut::: Well, he did say that he was gonna eat you first. Hopefully he'll be quick. No, actually I hope it'll be slow and painful.
Tuffnut::: I am Lycanwing! Run, run for your lives...
Snotlout::: Ah! Ah no get away from me!
Ruffnut::: Ugh, oh god. Tuffnut! Get back here! I command thee...Lycanwing! Oh...slow down! Slow down...
Snotlout::: Huh, is that you? Buddy?
Tuffnut::: The apex is upon us! C'mon, do it with me, Chicken! It feels so good! And we only have a few moments left till we can fly! FLYYY! Riding high! The currents of the wind blowing through our hair! Ah, I mean, your feathers, you have feathers, not hair-FREE from the bonds, that bind humankind! We have to fly away, right? I would never forgive myself if I ate the other dragon riders. I mean, on the other side though, I'm sure as a dragon I would find them delicious, especially that Fishlegs, good Thor he looks like a marshmallow! Flesh-colored in with a little hair on the top.
Tuffnut::: Ahhh! It's happening, it's happening, I can feel it! Are you ready, Chicken? Are you finally ready to be free?!
Ruffnut::: TUFF! DON'T DO IT!
Tuffnut::: Ughhh! We've been through this, Chicken! Don't try and impersonate my sister. We made a pact! I'm doing it and you're coming with me.
Ruffnut::: Tuffnut, it's me! Look at me, bro! You can fight this!
Tuffnut::: I can't, sis. You don't know the hold it has on me. It has its claws on me.
Ruffnut::: What if we fight it together? We do everything together, we always have! Look, I refuse to spend the rest of my life doing anything alone. Do you hear me?!
Tuffnut::: You always were the brave one. Mom should have named you Tuffnut.
Ruffnut::: But she didn't. She named you Tuff. I'm begging you! And you know how much I hate to beg, just get down from there!
Tuffnut::: It's too late to stop the metamorphasis, can you not see what I've become? MEEEHEHEHE!
Hiccup::: Tuff, stop! There is no metamorphasis, alright?. You are not turning into a dragon. Fishlegs, pelase tell him.
Fishlegs::: It's true! We found the cave of the Lycanwing. It was just a myth to keep people away from these!
Tuffnut::: No. No! I don't believe you. Look at me. I'm hideous, I'm terrifying!
Astrid::: Tuff! You're not hideous! Terrifying at times, yes. Hideous? No.
Tuffnut::: Well, then how do you explain this? Can't do it, can you, hm? That's what I thought. Now, it's time to fly!
Snotlout::: Wait wait wait wait! Wait! I can explain! I can explain it!
Tuffnut::: Whoa, you look worse than I do.
Hiccup::: Uh, Snotlout? What do you have in that bag?
Snotlout::: I have what did this!
Tuffnut::: Ah! The Lycanwing got him too. Save yourselves!
Snotlout::: It's not a Lycanwing. It's not even a dragon! It's a wolf. And I caught him. You're not turning into a dragon, Tuff.
Tuffnut::: I'm not? I'm not!
Hiccup::: That's what we've been trying to tell you.
Snotlout::: I just made you think that! But it's not true. It's funny, but it's not true.
Tuffnut::: No!
Tuffnut::: Don't worry, buddy! I've gotchu. We're going home Chicken. We're going home.
Hiccup::: Oh, thank Thor.
Tuffnut::: Oh I know what you're gonna say, you realized how much you love me, you were scared, you were gonna lose me, and I better never do that again.
Ruffnut::: Actually, I was just going to tell you what an idiot you are. Come here.
Ruffnut whispers::: Thank you.
Hiccup::: Uh, Snotlout, where's the wolf?
Snotlout::: Huh?
Wolf point of view::: the wolf lunges at Snotlout who screams.
