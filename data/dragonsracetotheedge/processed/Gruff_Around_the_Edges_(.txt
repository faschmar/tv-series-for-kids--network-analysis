Hiccup::: awakens, startled What the-?!
Tuffnut::: through the horn Goooood morning, Dragon's Edge! I-I-It's Tuff!
Ruffnut::: Aaand Ruff!
Tuffnut::: Aaand Chicken!
Tuffnut and Ruffnut::: In the mooornings.
Ruffnut::: Alright folks, now it's time for your weather forecast. Today's it's gonna be freezing cold.
Ruffnut::: And tomorrow will be, well, freezing cold!
Snotlout::: Leave it to you two muttonheads to use the Thunder Ear backwards!
Tuffnut::: Ooor...are we using it right-wards?
Tuffnut::: To inform the masses!
Ruffnut::: Plus, the earwax on this thing keeps our lips from chapping!
Ruffnut::: to Tuffnut You know, we really should market this.
Tuffnut::: OK, let's check the old mailbag and see what Terrible Terror Mails came in last night.
Ruffnut::: Oh, here's one for Snotlout! I miss your snuggles, too. Signed, Mommy.
Snotlout::: Hey! That's private!
Ruffnut::: Whoa, this one's addressed to us! Dear Ruff and Tuff, your cousin Gruffnut is on his way to visit you today...
Tuffnut::: Wait, Gruffnut? Gruffnut's coming here?! Today? Oh, no. Look at me. I am a mess. Alright, show's over, I gotta go get ready.
Tuffnut::: chanting Gruff is coming, Gruff is coming, Gruff is coming...Gruffnut's gonna be here any second. This place needs to look nice. to Ruffnut You wanna help, just a little?
Ruffnut::: No.
Heather::: OK...I'm new here. Who is Gruffnut?
Snotlout::: He's their cousin. We've never met him, but Tuffnut worships the guy.
Tuffnut::: scoffing No I don't, even if he is a totally awesome world traveler and fearless adventurer.
Ruffnut::: Yeah, you say traveler, I say drifter. He just wanders into our lives every few years.
Tuffnut::: Hiccup, what do you guys think about me...taking over the reins around here? You know, just while Gruff is around?
Hiccup::: Don't you remember what happened last time you were in charge?
Tuffnut::: I'm sorry, everything's on fire!
Tuffnut::: To be fair, I was only in co-charge of the island, so I think we all know who's fault that really was.
Gruffnut::: Did this island just get 100% more amazing or is it just me?
Tuffnut::: Gruffnut! Oh, my hero! Ick, cousin, how are you...friend?
Tuffnut::: Gruffnut, these are the Dragon Riders. Dragon Riders, this...is the Gruffnut.
Gruffnut::: Hello everyone, and the always fabulous Ruffnut.
Ruffnut::: Eh...cousin Gruffnut...
Hiccup::: No one mentioned the...family resemblance.
Tuffnut::: I don't see it at all.
Gruffnut::: Oh, me neither.
Tuffnut::: Sooo, cuz...what have you been up to?
Gruffnut::: Oh, the usual. Winning my weight in gold. That sort of thing.
Fishlegs::: How does one win their weight in gold, exactly?
Gruffnut::: Yeah, spear throwing competition. Of course.
Snotlout:::  Whoa that's a lot of gold. Could I see it? Maybe hold it and caress it?
Gruffnut::: Gah, I'm sorry, but I don't have it anymore.
Ruffnut::: sarcastically Ohhh, what a surprise.
Gruffnut::: Yup, gave it all away to the poor.
Tuffnut::: Generosity is only exceeded by your adventure-osity.
Ruffnut::: I have an idea...cuz. Why not show everyone your awesome spear-throwing skills that won you all that gold that you conveniently don't have anymore?
Gruffnut::: I'd be happy to put on a little exhibition...except that my arm is still injured from...that shipwreck...that darn shipwreck...
Ruffnut::: What shipwreck?
Gruffnut::: I didn't mention the saving of the sinking shipload of orphans?
Tuffnut::: Oh, no. Buried the lead, I guess. 'Cause you're so humble.
Gruffnut::: The most. Well, enough about me. Tuff, what have you been doing while I was out winning fortunes and saving orphans and defeating the Kraken?
Tuffnut::: Well, uh...I..I-I-I have Chicken!
Gruffnut::: smirking Oh-ho.
Tuffnut::: Um...
Hiccup::: Hey, Tuffnut, why don't you show Gruffnut around the base-uh...uh around your base?
Gruffnut::: Your base? Whoa.
Tuffnut::: Well, it's not really my base...I-I just designed it, built it, run it. C'mon, follow me. We'll give you the grand tour ahead. Ruffnut, escort this chicken to its quarters.
Tuffnut::: The dock is down there. And, uh, there's the stables.
Gruffnut::: Oh, and that's where you keep the dragons. And I bet that's well-guarded.
Tuffnut::: Eh, not really. Who's gonna steal a dragon? I mean, unless you can fly one, you're not getting very far.
Gruffnut::: Right. Of course. Hadn't thought of that.
Tuffnut::: Yeah...that's why they put me in charge. I think of things.
Tuffnut::: I designed the arena roof to be totally de-tractable.
Hiccup::: Re-tractable.
Tuffnut::: That too, retractable and de-tractable. See? You just use this lever.
Tuffnut::: And this is where I do all of my inventi-ish-iating.
Gruffnut::: Is that a bed over there?
Tuffnut::: Yeah, I let Hiccup sleep in here. You know, to guard my inventions. Like this one.
Tuffnut::: With this, I can really fly. Like a dragon! I'll give you a little demonstration...
Hiccup::: T-Tuffnut, no...
Tuffnut::: This invention is my sword of fire!
Gruffnut::: That sounds magnificent! How does it work?
Tuffnut::: I'll show you. You just...these...don't....
Hiccup::: No no no NO NO NO!
Tuffnut::: I've been...meaning to do that, actually. 'Cause I needed...better...ventilation in here. Hey! Check this out!
Hiccup::: Hey-uh, actually, would you mind if I talked to...my boss here, for a second?
Gruffnut::: Sure, and uh, Tuff, don't be too hard on him. Accidents happen.
Tuffnut::: It's going great, am I right?
Hiccup::: Uh, no. Look, I'm sorry, Tuff. I was trying to help you out, but this is not working.
Tuffnut::: What do you mean? Sure it is.
Tuffnut::: Uh...
Hiccup::: You have to tell Gruffnut the truth.
Gruffnut::: Tell Gruffnut the truth about what? C'mon, no secrets! There's holes in the walls.
Tuffnut::: OK, fine, I don't actually run the base.
Gruffnut::: Tuff, no need to embellish. Everywhere I go, I hear about your heroic exploits. Fighting dragon hunters, saving islands...you don't need to lie to impress me, Tuffnut, because you already have.
Tuffnut::: sniffling I wanna say for the record that I am not crying. I just have...a bug in each one of my eyes. In the same place. And it's irritating each of them equally.
Gruffnut::: Hey, you know what would be awesome? If the two of you heroes took me on a ride on that dragon of yours.
Ruffnut::: What? No. Sorry pal. Look, it's sort of a two-person set up. I don't think all three of us-
Tuffnut::: So, what do you think?
Gruffnut::: Incredible! A-and I gotta say, flying doesn't seem that hard! Basically, you just lean one way or the other.
Tuffnut::: Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Rufnut::: sarcastically Oh, sure, yeah, not that hard at all. Anybody can do this.
Gruffnut::: Oh, OK, whoa...
Ruffnut::: Whooohoohoohoo! Yeah!
Gruffnut::: Oh my, oh my!
Tuffnut::: Take it easy, Ruff.
Ruffnut::: What do you mean, take it easy? An adventurer like cousin Gruffnut? C'mon, this is tame!
Gruffnut::: Oh, no!
Gruffnut::: Hey, Tuff and Ruff, thanks for the dragon.
Ruffnut::: What?
Tuffnut::: Huh?
Gruffnut::: Ha-ha!
Ruffnut::: What was that? Did you just try to steal our dragon?!
Gruffnut::: Don't be ridiculous.
Ruffnut::: You said, Thanks for the dragon! And then took off.
Gruffnut::: Yeah? 'Cause I was making a joke!
Tuffnut::: Yeah, Ruff, can't you tell when it's a joke?
Tuffnut::: Gruff, speaking of jokes, you're always looking for fresh material on your adventures.
Gruffnut::: That sounds magnificent!
Ruffnut::: Huh...let's keep an eye on cousin Gruffnut.
Ruffnut::: Hiccup, I'm telling you, I saw him go in there. Alone. You know? By himself.
Hiccup::: Excuse me.
Gruffnut::: Uh, whoa.
Gruffnut::: Whoa, hey!
Hiccup::: Toothless, easy bud. It's OK.
Ruffnut::: Gotchu.
Gruffnut::: You sure did. I'm sorry but I just couldn't help taking a closer look at this magnificent tail device!
Ruffnut::: What?!
Gruffnut::: Amazing workmanship, Hiccup! You know, I'm a bit of an inventor myself.
Ruffnut::: sarcastically Oh, yeah, right.
Tuffnut::: There you are, Gruff! C'mon, I've got the boars greased, pig prime.
Gruffnut::: Oh, ha, sorry Hiccup, uh, another time, perhaps?
Tuffnut::: Huh, gee, Ruff, I only brought two boars.
Gruffnut::: Yeah, you'd get boar-ed just watching. Get it? Boar-ed?
Tuffnut::: Yeah, hahaha! I love it!
Tuffnut::: Goooood morning Dragon's Edge! It's Tuff...aaand...
Ruffnut::: Ruff. Aaand...
Tuffnut::: Wait, where's Gruffnut?
Ruffnut::: gasps Gruffnut's not here? sarcastically Oh, what a shock! Oh wait, no, no it's not. 'Cause that's his thing. He just blows into town and before anyone can get too close, he slithers off like the snake that he is!
Tuffnut::: No, way! We boar-bonded last night. I-I'm sure he just overslept. I'm gonna go find Gruffnut and when I do, you're gonna owe him a big apology.
Gruffnut::: C'mon, girl. Take the yummy fishy!
Gruffnut::: Ow! Ew...
Tuffnut::: There you are!
Gruffnut::: Tuffnut! You're supposed to be doing your morning show right now.
Tuffnut::: Ha! We both are! C'mon, let's go. I can't wait to see the look on Ruff's face when she sees that you-
Gruffnut::: Yeah, see, I'm not-I'm not-I'm not feeling great this morning. Maybe tomorrow? We can do tomorrow.
Tuffnut::: Wait...What are those fish for...? Please tell me you're not trying to bribe Stormfly so you could ride her.
Gruffnut::: Ha! Haha, of course not!
Gruffnut::: Look, I just wanted to take a quick spin! I-I kinda got dragon fever after riding Barf and Belch, so I thought-
Gruffnut::: Oh...never mind. What are we doing here, cousin? You know I'm lying, I know I'm lying.
Tuffnut::: That's a lot of lying...
Gruffnut::: I didn't actually win my weight in gold throwing spears. So, I owe a lot of gold to some very dangerous men, Tuffnut. I need one of your dragons to pay them off.
Tuffnut::: Gruffnut, I looked up to you. You're my role model! You're my hero.
Gruffnut::: Yeah, all side holes. Usually disappointing. Anyway, gotta go!
Tuffnut::: Hey! Uh-uh-uh. I don't think so.
Gruffnut::: Tuff, you couldn't take me when we were kids. What makes you think you can take me now?
Tuffnut::: You know what, come to think of it, I don't have to. Stormfly's not gonna let any old stranger fly her outta here. None of our dragons would.
Gruffnut::: You've got me. Dead to rights. Oh. I dunno what came over me. I'm just so ashamed.
Tuffnut::: Oh...c'mon...It's not that bad. You know what they say, forgiveness is a dish best served freezing cold!
Gruffnut::: Oh, cousin! You are one of a kind. Well, almost. Look! A rainbow!
Tuffnut::: What? A rainbow?!
Tuffnut::: GRUFFNUT!
Gruffnut::: in Tuffnut's clothing Bad news, everyone! Gruffnut, yeah, Gruffnut had some place really awesome he had to. And so now he's gone. For, a while.
Ruffnut::: I told you so.
Gruffnut::: Oh, yeah, you did. Tell me what?
Ruffnut::: That he would do what he always does. Show up. Get you to worship him again. And then disappear.
Gruffnut::: Well, why wouldn't I-uh...Why wouldn't worship him? Gruffnut is awesome.
Ruffnut::: No he isn't! He's a phony.
Gruffnut::: Uh...maybe he is a phony, but he's smart enough to fool people, that's their fault!
Hiccup::: What?
Gruffnut::: Uh..I, uh...oh. I mean, that's something Gruffnut would say. Not me, Tuffnut. Now, you've given me a lot to think about. So I...I guess I, Tuffnut, will go. Think about it.
Fishlegs::: Juuust when you thought Tuffnut couldn't get any weirder.
Tuffnut::: OK, you can do this, Tuffnut. Just dislocate your shoulder, and you will slip right out of these ropes. One, two, threEEE-AHHH!
Tuffnut::: OH! That did not work! Because...I needed a running start! OK, here we are.
Tuffnut::: OHHH-OWWW! That is no good.
Gruffnut::: Hookfang! Heh, it's me, Tuffnut. Your old buddy. You don't mind if I take you for a little spin, do ya?
Gruffnut::: Well, guess I'll settle for a Gronckle. Hopefully they'll pay me by the pound!
Gruffnut::: Gah, get out of here! Stop!
Gruffnut::: Dummy beak bird.
Tuffnut::: OK.
Tuffnut::: No, dislocating my hip doesn't work either. Time for the ankles.
Tuffnut::: Uh...c'mere little guy! Do you know Smidvarg? He and I are tight buddies from way back. Quick question, how are you with knots?
Fishlegs::: Excuse me, has someone been feeding Meatlug feltzfard again? You know how it bloats her!
Hiccup::: Looks like we need someone to take your patrol shift. Any volun-
Gruffnut::: Uh, we'll do it! We'll do it.
Ruffnut::: We what?
Snotlout::: Who are you, and what have you done with the real Tuffnut.
Gruffnut::: What, what is that supposed to mean?
Snotlout::: No offense, you just don't volunteer very...well, ever.
Gruffnut::: Oh, yeah! I mean, you're right. But now that, uh, that Gruffnut jerk is gone I think Ruff and I could use a little us time. Right, sis? I missed ya.
Ruffnut::: You had me at that Gruffnut jerk. Hey, what if macey comes along, too?
Gruffnut::: Uh, no-no thanks.
Ruffnut::: Huh?
Gruffnut::: I mean, maybe you should get to carry Macey for a change. Right?
Hiccup::: Huh, oh, the things I do, over-
Tuffnut::: Hiccup!
Hiccup::: You!
Tuffnut::: Yes. Me! Thanks for the ride, Peggy. C'mon, get.
Hiccup::: What are you doing back here?
Tuffnut::: Uh, I live here.
Hiccup::: Oh, no you don't! I don't know what you've conned Tuffnut into, but no way, Gruffnut.
Tuffnut::: Hiccup, I'm not Gruffnut, I'm Tuffnut!
Hiccup::: Yeah, sure you are. You do a very good Tuffnut impression. I think I know one of my best friends when I see him.
Tuffnut::: gasps Hiccup! We're best friends?! Really? Even though I almost burned down the whole island that one time, and also, once released the Skrill...crushed you under a bunch of logs and the stones...?
Hiccup::: Tuffnut! It really is you! Which...means that Ruffnut's out on patrol with Gruffnut pretending to be you!
Gruffnut::: Whoa, the air's pretty rough, huh?
Ruffnut::: Mm-hm.
Gruffnut::: Oh, look! Suddenly, a ship!
Ruffnut::: I don't recognize it. Should we take a look?
Gruffnut::: S-sure, whatever you think.
Ruffnut::: Whatever I think?
Gruffnut::: Whoa, whoa, oh dear.
Ruffnut::: OK, that's it! What are you trying to pull, Gruffnut?
Gruffnut::: Gruffnut? What are you...talking about, sister?
Ruffnut::: The real Tuffnut never cares what I think. While I'm at it, he wouldn't volunteer us for this mission. And he would never. Ever! Let me carry Macey!
Gruffnut::: Well, what do you know? I always said you were the smarter twin.
Ruffnut::: Flattery has no effect on me, mainly because I never hear any. So cut the sheep dip, and tell me who's on that boat down there.
Gruffnut::: You wouldn't understand.
Ruffnut::: It's people you owe money to, right? You wanna trade them Barf and Belch to pay off your stupid debt.
Gruffnut::: OK, whoa. Seriously, you are the smarter twin.
Ruffnut::: Not gonna happen!
Gruffnut::: Don't make me do this the hard way, Ruffnut.
Ruffnut::: I do everything the hard way!
Gruffnut::: Down, dragon!
Ruffnut::: No...you...don't!
Ruffnut::: You are not good enough for the Nut name!
Hiccup::: There they are!
Tuffnut::: This is my fault! For not listening to Ruff. I could I be so stupid! I have to make this up to her. It's time for ballista nut!
Hiccup::: Tuff! No no NO!
Tuffnut::: Here I come!
Tuffnut::: No!
Gruffnut::: Be honest. That was hilarious.
Tuffnut::: Back in action! Be honest. That was painful.
Tuffnut::: Oh, yeah. Oh yeah.
Tuffnut::: Ow, ow! My ankle, my ankle!
Gruffnut::: Ow, you dislocated my hip! Hurts more than I imagine!
Gruffnut::: Chinese finger move!
Tuffnut::: Flight suit! Flight suit!
Gruffnut::: Give me that!
Tuffnut::: No no no no no!
Tuffnut::: Nahhhhh!
Ruffnut::: Hey! C'mon guys, work with me here!
Dragon Hunter 1::: Fire!
Hiccup::: I can't risk hitting Tuffnut.
Tuffnut::: I used to look up to you.
Tuffnut::: Ah! No no no no!
Gruffnut::: Let me give you another chance. Agh!
Gruffnut::: Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Tuffnut::: Help!
Ruffnut::: Tuff!
Tuffnut::: to Ruffnut Macey me!
Gruffnut::: Ow! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!
Gruffnut::: Oh no. Whoa!
Tuffnut::: Thanks, sis.
Ruffnut::: You got it, bro.
Gruffnut::: Oh, hey guys! The dragon thing, it's, guh...it end up being more compli...ah, how 'bout that gold I owe ya? What do you say we go double or nothing, huh? Oh no.
Tuffnut::: Goooood morning Dragon's Edge! It's Tuff!
Ruffnut::: And Ruff!
Tuffnut::: And Chicken!
Ruffnut::: In the mornings! With our special guest, Hiccup Haddock!
Hiccup::: Hi-hi there.
Tuffnut::: Oooh, Sir Talks-a-lot. OK, enough about you. How great were we yesterday?
Hiccup::: Uh, you were very great. You saved Barf and Belch from being sold by Gruffnut. And, uh, I was very impressed that despite everything he did, you still rescued him.
Ruffnut::: Well, he is family.
Tuffnut::: And he still had my helmet.
Ruffnut::: That too.
Hiccup::: Speaking of which, where is Gruffnut?
Ruffnut::: Oh, we decided he should have a real adventure for a change.
Gruffnut::: This won't be so bad. At least I have-I have shelter.
Gruffnut::: IT WAS A GIANT-AHHH!
