Snotlout mocking Hiccup::: Let's explore the island on foot; rest the dragons for a long trip home, I'm a muttonhead! OK, genius, what's our next move?
Hiccup::: W-weapons, we need weapons.
Snotlout::: Got one!
Hiccup::: Snotlout, let go!
Snotlout::: What? Called dibs! Gimme!
Hiccup::: OK, so check that island off the list.
Fishlegs::: Ooh-hoo-hoo! This is so exciting! Searching the high seas for an island outpost to call our own!
Ruffnut::: Yeah, I like this idea! Move away from Berk, get my own place, away from you-know-who...
Tuffnut::: Yeah, you're telling me, sister. I am so sick of you-know-who. He never knows when to shut up! I want him out of here!
Hiccup::: Guys, let's focus, alright, we need to find an island that's safe, secure, and habitable for both us and the dragons.
Snotlout::: Blah, blah, blah! How many times do we have to hear that?
Hiccup::: Um, until we find what we're looking for? Let's check this one out.
Hiccup::: Not bad, not bad! Lots of fresh water, seems like a plentiful food supply...
Ruffnut::: And lots of cool blue flowers...
Ruffnut::: I'm in!
Astrid::: Wait...aren't those...?
Fishlegs::: Gasps. Blue Oleanders, deadly poisonous to dragons.
Tuffnut::: So...we're not staying.
Fishlegs::: Whoa, this island is beautiful! I even like those weird dots all over the...
Hiccup::: Those aren't dots! They're Whispering Death holes!
Snotlout::: Been there, done that.
Astrid::: Next!
Fishlegs::: My bad! Should've crossed this island off the list!
Fishlegs::: OK...vomits in his mouth
Hiccup::: This looks pretty good!
Astrid::: Those cliffs could work! Good sight lines, easily defendable...
Fishlegs::: The location is great!
Ruffnut::: It's perfect!
Tuffnut::: Yeah...too perfect...I'm just saying in the immortal words of the mighty Thor: When something looks too perfect, it probably...sucks.
Hiccup::: Yeah, you know I'm pretty sure Thor never said anything remotely like that.
Tuffnut::: Oh really? How do you know? Do you know Thor? Have you talked to him recently?
Hiccup:::...No...but-
Tuffnut::: Well, because I have! Hm, and I don't recall him mentioning you...Look. I just have a feeling about this place. I think we all know what happens when I get a feeling.
Astrid::: We ignore it?
Tuffnut::: Mark my words! There will be something wrong with this island, something mysterious, something horrible, something...something...
Ruffnut:::...Ya finished?
Hiccup::: OK, first thing we need to do is set up camp for the night. We need dry wood for fire. We need fresh water, and we need someone on traps.
Astrid::: Snotlout, what is that?
Snotlout::: It's an S, for Snotlout. I think aesthetically it would look nice flying over it.
Astrid::: That's ridiculous. It doesn't matter what the outpost looks like. It needs to be functional and operational.
Hiccup::: Uh, guys? What we really need is-
Fishlegs::: -is a place for rest, relaxation, and replenishing after a hard day's work. You're absolutely right Hiccup, look, Meatlug and I had some thoughts...
Astrid::: Is that a hot tub?
Fishlegs::: No! That's the mud bath!...The hot tub is over there.
Hiccup::: Tell me about it.
Tuffnut::: Wait a minute. Everyone stop. I don't see it.
Ruffnut::: Me neither...
Hiccup::: See what?
Tuffnut::: Um, the boar pit! Where is it? Where's the boar pit?
Ruffnut::: You see, the centerpiece of any good outpost is a boar pit.
Astrid::: Why?
Tuffnut darkly::: Everybody needs a little entertainment every now and then, don't they?
Fishlegs::: Well, we do know where to get boars...
Hiccup::: Whoops! Sorry about that. OK, so, uh, now that we have your attention, we really need to set up camp for the night.
Tuffnut::: Wait, what about the-
Hiccup::: Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-we-we'll talk about the outpost design in the morning. For now, someone needs to get the water.
Snotlout to Astrid::: Ugh. I don't know about you, but I like Whiny Berk Hiccup way better than Princess Outpost Hiccup.
Astrid::: I know, right?
Hiccup::: What is it, bud?
Tuffnut::: I'll tell you what it is. Rats. Rats the size of yaks. No, it could also-is it? Yaks the size of rats? Yak-rats! chuckles Great, those would be adorable. No, no! I know what it is. Yaks the size of dragons, right Toothless? Ya feel me, T?
Fishlegs::: scoffs and chuckles There's no such thing as yaks the size of dragons.
Tuffnut::: Yak-dragons to you, my friend. And when you hear their cries...you'll believe. Trust me. Hm? Rak-ay-ya-ya-na-na-na-na-oh! ---- Puh Poo.
Tuffnut::: That's right. Let that roll around in your head for a minute.
Hiccup::: Alright, Tuffnut, knock it off.
Snotlout::: Yeah, you're not scaring anyone.
Tuffnut::: Really? What if there were...snakes out there in the dark! Hm? Giant snakes? Snakes big enough to swallow a man whole and then barf out his bones? Bleh-ehh-ehh-ehh!
Snotlout::: Ha! Please...barfing out bones...
Snotlout:::....What?
Tuffnut::: Yeah, that's right. Go to bed! Sleep! If you can...
Tuffnut muttering::: Trolls, demon-toads...
Transition::: Fire burns out. Sounds from the forest startle Tuffnut awake.
Tuffnut::: Ah! What was that?
Tuffnut mutters::: It's in the trees...Ah! Yak-rats! I knew it...
Tuffnut full of relief::: Oh...it's just a chicken. It's a tiny chicken. clears throat Hellooo breakfast!
Tuffnut::: Oh...my...Thor...
Cut to next scene::: The gang are still back at the campsite, sleeping.
Snotlout:::  Mmm, Astrid you look like a pillow. Mmm.
Tuffnut::: Help! Ah! Aaah! gasping for breath Chicken! Roaring! Roaring huge chicken! Chicken roar!
Fishlegs while Tuffnut is rambling in the background::: Is he saying that he saw a big roaring chicken?
Tuffnut::: Not chicken...dragon. Huge! Massive! What's another word? dead serious Colossal.
Fishlegs::: But what happened to the chicken?
Tuffnut::: Forget the chicken! WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!
Astrid::: yawns Is anyone falling for this?
Ruffnut::: I don't know, I haven't seen him this freaked out since he found a leech on his-
Astrid::: Okaaay, I'm going to stop you there...ugh...
Hiccup::: sighs exasperatedly OK, fine, let's just check this out, so we can all go back to sleep.
Tuffnut::: OK, when this giant beast rips us limb to limb I will expect a full apology from each and every one of you. And a handshake. No, you won't be able to shake hands 'cause your limbs will be gone.
Tuffnut::: Shhh...jumps AHHH! Ha-ha! karate chops the air multiple times
Tuffnut::: No no no, it was here! And it was huge! I'm not making this up! to the chicken Here, tell them. You were standing right there. Tell them, chicken.
Ruffnut::: Uh, you're scaring me, bro. OK? And we shared a room.
Tuffnut::: I can't even look at you right now.
Tuffnut::: What did you just say?!
Tuffnut::: I didn't think so.
Hiccup::: Yawns and stretches OK, now, let's talk outpost.
Astrid::: Since you brought it up, I've been working on my designs. We'll set up look-out posts with interlocking fields of fire and-
Fishlegs::: -and never get any rest. But here, in my meditation garden...
Snotlout::: Neither of those is S-shaped, did you not see my design?
Ruffnut from behind Snotlout, Fishlegs, and the shield with Fishleg's model::: Boar pit. Boar pit! BOAR PIT!
Hiccup::: Guys guys guys guys li-listen to me, OK, we need one idea. We can't design five different outposts. Orrr...can we? You know what? Boar pit, great idea!
Ruffnut::: Whoaaa...what just happened.
Hiccup::: S-shaped? I love it!
Snotlout::: Don't freak me out, Hiccup! It gives me the willies...
Hiccup::: I'm just saying let's all come up with a design that we each think is the best and then we'll vote on it. Does that sound fair?
Astrid::: What are you up to?
Hiccup::: N-nothin'! Nothing at all! Just trying to keep the troops happy. You know what they say, uh, happy troops are, uh, happy...groups...? Hey, uh, speaking of troops, Ruff, where's your other half?
Ruffnut::: Don't ask me! All I know is that this boar pit is not gonna dig itself.
Tuffnut::: OK, giant dragon, you are officially on notice. Oh, you can run, but you can't hide. I guess you can fly, you can also run, you can run or fly, but either way you can't hide, because nothing escapes the watchful eye of-AH!
Tuffnut from the bottom::: Oh, I am hurt, I am very much hurt!
Tuffnut to the chicken::: Ugh. You couldn't have warned me?
Tuffnut::: OK, so it's gonna be the hard way. Fine, that's the way I like it. Just ask the chicken...
Tuffnut::: Whoa! Ha! Ha! See? Oh yeah, Tuffnut Thorston is locked in now, he ain't falling off another cli-
Tuffnut as he's falling::: Multiple ledges! Ow ow ow ow ow! This island is very cliffy!
Hiccup::: Do you hear that, Toothless? That's the sound of peace and quiet. You know, making them work together might be the best idea I've ever had.
Snotlout::: Uh, excuse me? My rock!
Fishlegs::: Huh, how do you figure?
Snotlout::: I need it! That rock makes the bottom of my S, and I need my S.
Fishlegs::: Really? Your S. Your genius architectural marvel.
Snotlout::: Give me. The rock.
Fishlegs::: Huh...since you put it like that...
Fishlegs::: There. There's your rock.
Snotlout::: And there's your architectural marvel.
Hiccup::: And I've spoken too soon.
Ruffnut sickingly sweet::: Hey Hiccup, I'm readyÂ for a dry run, do you want to be the boar? cackles
Ruffnut::: Whoaaa...what happened to him?
Transition::: Tuffnut sitting against a log with the chicken, and Hiccup and Ruffnut standing up.
Hiccup::: You've really been out there all day looking for that dragon?
Ruffnut::: Instead of digging our boar pit. Priorities, huh? lightly punches Hiccup's right arm
Hiccup::: Or maybe he really did see something.
Tuffnut::: Oh, I saw something. You did too, you little backstabber. Tell them. chicken squawks Aw, save it. You had your chance.
Ruffnut::: Or, this whole thing is a bunch of stinky yak dung.
Tuffnut::: You know what? First of all, yak dung, when made into a nice tea, can be quite a-ro-ma-tic.
Ruffnut::: Agreed...but, I still think you're just trying to scare everybody. There's no dragon out there.
Tuffnut::: Yes, there is, Ruffnut, you wanna put your mutton where your mouth is?
Ruffnut::: Oh-h-h, you're not suggesting-
Tuffnut::: Oh, I am! I'm suggesting like a hot Gronckle in a lava pit. You know exactly what that means.
Hiccup::: Wha-What is going on with you two?
Ruffnut::: Silence!
Tuffnut::: I officially declare Thorston Challenge...
Hiccup::: Thorston what?!
Ruffnut::: Accepted! Usual stakes?
Tuffnut::: Of course.
Hiccup::: Wha-What? Stakes?
Tuffnut::: It's better you don't know.
Snotlout::: Give it to me!
Astrid::: It's mine!
Hiccup::: I know, bud, I'm losing it too. Ruff? Tuff? Wait up! How 'bout a couple of impartial judges for the Thorston Challenge? For the love of Thor, take us with you!
Tuffnut muttering in his sleep::: Tastes like chicken. Chicken on a stick. Chicken a la mode...
Hiccup::: Aaand that's probably where we should call it a night.
Tuffnut::: Chicken rice...
Ruffnut::: Sure! Since we never found that quote on quote yak-dragon, declare me the Thorston Challenge Winner and we can all go home!
Hiccup::: Ah, OK, sure, um, by the power, uh, vested in me I hereby declare that Ruffnut is the-whoa!
Hiccup::: I don't believe it...
Ruffnut::: Me neither. Tuffnut wins the Thorston Challenge.
Tuffnut::: Yes! Told you. Now, pay up!
Hiccup::: Guys, focus! Look, it's headed straight for our campsite. If it catches those asleep on the ground...
Tuffnut::: I forgive you too.
Twins::: See you in Valhalla!
Ruffnut::: Here we gooo!
Hiccup::: What in the name of...It's not one big dragon! It's tons of little ones!
Ruffnut::: If this is Valhalla-
Twins to each other::: What are you doing here?
Tuffnut::: Whoa, check that out!
Ruffnut::: They're joining back up around the white one!
Hiccup::: It must be the leader! This is amazing...
Hiccup::: Guys, what are you doing?
Tuffnut::: Bam! Problem solved. Alright, let's head home.
Hiccup::: I don't know about you bud, but I've got a bad feeling about this...
Fishlegs::: Amazing...
Astrid::: It looks sort of like a Terrible Terror...
Astrid::: But...bigger and meaner.
Hiccup::: And it seems like they're nocturnal.
Hiccup::: You know, they come out at night...
Snotlout::: Yeah, I knew that! Noc-o-turnal...I was gonna explain that to them. looks meaningfully at the twins
Fishlegs::: I say we call them...Night Terrors.
Tuffnut::: Hey, I saw it first, so I get to name it. chicken bawks No, you always say that. Now, let's think about this logically. They come out at night, and they're terrifying. Terror of the night...I've got it. Smidvarg and the Gang!
Hiccup::: And, Night Terrors, it is!
Astrid::: What's going on out there?
Tuffnut::: I don't know. Whatever it is, Smidvarg doesn't like it, and the Gang isn't paying attention.
Hiccup::: Let's check it out.
Transition to air::: the Riders are flying in V formation looking for the other Night Terrors, and they spot three Changewings preying on them.
Hiccup::: Changewings! Toothless rumbles I know, bud, not exactly a fair fight, is it. Let's even up the odds.
Astrid::: No bullies on our island!
Snotlout::: Hey, you can't treat our dragons like that!
Ruffnut::: Only we can treat our dragons like that!
Hiccup::: That should take care of 'em.
Fishlegs::: But what about those guys?
Hiccup::: Incoming!
Astrid::: How many?
Hiccup::: Too many!
Fishlegs::: Why are they all coming here now?
Hiccup::: I-it must be the Night Terrors! When we captured the white one they all split up!
Fishlegs::: Oh, of course! They flock into a shape of a giant version of themselves as a defense mechanism to scare off predators!
Hiccup::: And now that they can't...
Astrid::: They're lunch!
Hiccup::: Oh, I knew this was gonna be bad! OK, we have to help them. I'll head back for the white Night Terror. He's their leader. You guys hold them off as long as you can.
Hiccup::: Yup! Probably deserved that.
Tuffnut::: You leave our Smidvarg alone!
Hiccup::: Great job. You cover Smidvarg from behind, Toothless and I will lead the way.
Hiccup::: What? OK, so it's growing on me.
Fishlegs::: Lava blast! Oh Thor, oh Thor!
Astrid::: Stormfly!
Fishlegs resignedly::: Oh Thor.
Snotlout::: Yes!
Fishlegs::: Ha ha ha!
Transition::: Daytime, a diagram is laid out on the grass.
Astrid::: What's this?
Hiccup::: A diagram of our new outpost! I got the idea from Smidvarg. So you see I combined all your ideas into one giant base. I was thinking we could call it the Dragon's Edge. What do you guys think?
Hiccup::: OK, I just need to point out that this the first time that that has ever happened. Let's take a look. Everybody gets to make their section of Dragon's Edge whatever they want it to be. Astrid, you can make yours the most heavily armed bedroom in the known Viking world. And Fishlegs, your place is quiet and secluded, overlooking the ocean. Very serene, very relaxing, with room for your very own rock garden. Snotlout, your spot is up here! Now it's, it's not S-shaped, but you can go S-crazy and paint 'em all over it.
Snotlout::: Yeah I can! Snotlout!
Twins::: Boar pit. Boar pit! BOAR PIT!
Hiccup::: Yes, yes! Haha! Glad you brought that up, there's a space for one right underneath your hut. Just do me a favor and lock up the boars after you're done with them.
Ruffnut::: Aw...
Tuffnut::: You do care! Boodooboodeedoo...
Hiccup::: We'll connect the different sections with bridges, zip-lines, and gangplanks. We'll have really cool stables with our own landing strip. And, of course, a dragon training arena. And in the center, overlooking everything else will be the clubhouse, the eye of Dragon's Edge.
Transition to nighttime::: building in the process.
Hiccup:::...actually taking shape. And now for one more addition to our outpost! Tuff?
Tuffnut:::...that's it, that's right, ha ha...ha...
Tuffnut::: Uh...what? Oh. Smidvarg! chicken pecks his face Ouch ow ow ow!
Tuffnut::: What? Oh, I can't have friends now?
Hiccup::: Well, if we're going to share the island with them, I thought we should share the outpost, too.
Fishlegs::: Plus it doesn't hurt that they seem to have an instinct to protect!
Hiccup::: They'll be like sentries. Right, Smidvarg?
Hiccups::: OK, so the Thorston Challenge. When is Ruffnut gonna pay up?
Tuffnut::: She already has, can't you tell? I mean, look at her, she lost, so she had to swap clothes with me!
Hiccup::: Riiight...and if you had lost?
Tuffnut::: Ugh, I'd have to swap clothes with her.
Hiccup::: Yeah, but you guys are exactly, uh-Astrid puts her hand on his mouth
Astrid::: Don't go there.
Hiccup::: What are they doing now?
Fishlegs::: No idea...
Fishlegs::: Hiccup, look!
Ruffnut::: Whoa...awesome...
Hiccup::: Amazing...
Fishlegs::: Impressive!
Tuffnut::: Oh, chicken, I couldn't have squawked it better myself...
