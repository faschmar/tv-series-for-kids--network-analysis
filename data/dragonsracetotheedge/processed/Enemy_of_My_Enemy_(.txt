Hiccup::: C'mon bud! Work with me here, please!
Hiccup::: Shhh! We're almost out of there so... Toothless... just...
Hiccup::: Uh, oh! Astrid! He, he, hey, hey! So, what brings you here so early in the morning? You just go for a test flight with Stormfly? Yeah, well, same here with Toothless, though, of course, because Stormfly, that will be, you know...
Astrid::: I don't believe this! You're going for a recon flight, alone! With no support, no cover, we talked about this!
Hiccup::: I, I know, I just didn't wanna awake anybody, it's no big deal, really!
Astrid::: Yes, it is! It's way too risky! Hiccup, he's not out there! It's been months since the Viggo's...
Hiccup::: Fiasco?
Astrid::: I was going to say episode. You have to stop this! You're gonna wear yourself to the ground looking for this guy who doesn't want be found!
Hiccup::: I'm fine, Astrid, really! Besides, maybe Viggo isn't out there, but his hunters are! If I can find one to question...
Astrid::: They won't tell you a thing!
Hiccup::: You don't know that!
Astrid::: Look, if you're going, at least let me and Stormfly go with you.
Hiccup::: Fine!
Hiccup::: Okay bud, it's now or never!
Hiccup::: When Astrid finds out that you're not wearing your armor, I am not covering for you! Woo-hoo! But, with all that armor on, would we be able to do this?
Hiccup::: Man, that new tail is awesome!
Hiccup::: I owe you one!
Hiccup::: Gotcha! Hey bud, let's get in closer!
Hiccup::: Look like a dragon might got the best of 'em. Yeah, let's get out of here!
Hiccup::: What the... Sky, Toothless!
Dragon Hunter::: Fire!
Hiccup::: Toothless! C'mon bud, we can make that!
Hiccup::: I gotcha, Toothless! I'm right here! I know, Dragon Root! We just gotta wait it, bud! But who knows how long that's gonna take! C'mon!
Hiccup::: Oh, I am so sorry, bud, I'm so sorry I got us in this! I know, bud! I know, bud!
Dragon Hunter 1::: What's that by the big tree?
Dragon Hunter 2::: I can't tell.
Hiccup::: Oh, why didn't I listen, why didn't I listen, what is wrong with me?
Hiccup::: Shh, shh, shhh! Toothless, please! Ok, you stay still and keep quiet, I'm gonna buy us some time. I'll be back for you! I promise!
Dragon Hunter 1::: Perhaps, this way!
Dragon Hunter 2::: Alright! Through there!
Dragon Hunter 1::: Where'd he go?
Dragon Hunter 2::: Landed here.
Dragon Hunter 1::: There he is! Get him!
Dragon Hunter 2::: After him!
Hiccup::: What the...
Dragon Hunter 1::: Keep your eyes peeled! You two go in that way!
Dragon Hunter 2::: Aye! Alright, let's go!
Dragon Hunter 3::: We think they got away, sir!
Dragon Hunter 1::: They didn't get away! I saw the dragon go down myself. Gather more men and double back. And check the caves! We're not leaving until we find the rider and that Night Fury!
Hiccup::: Hey, how you doing? You think you can stand up, bud? C'mon, let's try to get you up! What do you say, huh? C'mon! No, no, it's okay, I got you Toothless. It's okay, bud! Come on! Think, Hiccup, think!
Dragon Hunter::: Keep looking! The Night Fury went down somewhere around here!
Hiccup::: No, no, no! Toothless! No, you gotta be quite!
Dragon Hunter 1::: Hey, over there!
Dragon Hunter 2::: Okay!
Hiccup::: If they want you Toothless, they're gonna have to go through me!
Hiccup::: What?
Dagur::: Hello, Hiccup!
Hiccup::: Dagur?! I wouldn't do that if I were you! Toothless!
Dagur::: Easy, brother! Hiccup, I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to help! Seriously? You need to calm down.
Hiccup::: You?
Dagur::: Plenty of time to answer all your Hiccup-y questions later! Right now, we need to move your dragon before this guys wake up. Or you can handle them yourself.
Dagur::: Okay, keep it moving! That a boy, Hiccup!
Hiccup::: Don't need the encouragement!
Dagur::: Hi there! Oh, c'mon! If I was gonna harm you, don't you think I would've done it by now?
Hiccup::: I don't know! You're pretty crafty!
Dagur::: Oh, crafty! Thank you, Hiccup! I appreciate the kind words! They were kind, right?
Hiccup::: You are so weird!
Hiccup::: Thanks!
Dagur::: Your welcome!
Dagur::: Dragons are a little heavier than they look. C'mon Hiccup! That's it! Help me out here! Wait here! We're good! Go!
Hiccup::: Oh, I knew it! What was I thinking?
Dagur::: Hiccup, this isn't a trap. Look! There!
Hiccup::: What? What are you...
Dagur::: HICCUP! JUST LOOK, please! I'll stay right here.
Dagur::: Be careful now, it can be a bit...
Hiccup::: Toothless! C'mon bud!
Dagur::: You gotta help me, Toothless!
Dagur::: Sorry about that! My fault! I should've warned you earlier! I'll try to do better.
Hiccup::: And I have officially stepped into an alternate archipelago.
Dagur::: Okay, right over here! Good job, Hiccup!
Dagur::: Yeah, I tend to have a lot of time on my hands these days!  Here you go, little buddy, there you go!  It's important to keep the mind sharp.  Yes! Answers! I did tell you those were en route. Well, after I came to the unfortunate realization that I was completely expandable while part of the dragon hunters and under the command of Viggo Grimborn... Uh, I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN THE LOOK ON HIS FACE AS I DROVE A... Have you ever tried that? It's catharctic! I used to think that the only deep breath were the last ones.  How's Heather?
Hiccup::: Yeah, you know, Heather... she's... okay...
Dagur::: Good, good! And her dragon? Was it Windshower?
Hiccup::: It's Windshear.
Dagur::: Right! Sorry!  Here you go, little buddy!  Anyway, after that... learning experience, I drifted at sea for quite some time. Then shipwrecked here. I've been alone on this island for months. You know, it's amazing when a near-death experience and hours upon hours, upon hours, upon hours, upon hours, upon hours upon hours of alone time will do to the mind, body and soul, Hiccup! I mean, you should try it sometime! What's so funny?
Hiccup::: You... this... I mean, yeah, I knew you were crazy, but this take the cake!
Dagur::: I'M NOT... crazy. But I do understand your skepticism.
Hiccup::: Dagur, why in the name of Thor should I believe a word you say?
Dagur::: You shouldn't. I don't deserve the benefit of the doubt.  Oh, you take that little water, yes, you good boy!  He's not looking good.
Hiccup::: He's never been hit with one of these. I don't know, maybe, maybe Night Furies react differently?
Dagur::: I never liked those Dragon Root arrows. Seemed like cheating to me. I hate cheaters! There is an antidote for this, you know. I saw Ryker and his men make it. I can give you the ingredients and together make the antidote to save your glorious Night Fury! Unless you want to take the chance for him surviving this on his own.
Dagur::: You may need that. They're still out there.
Dagur::: Bitter weed! That's the first ingredient. Looks like this, but darker.
Hiccup::: So, what caused this... new Dagur?
Dagur::: I told you! Near-death experience and a lot of time to think.
Hiccup::: About what?
Dagur::: Well, when you only care about yourself, life is simple. Your actions are clear, consequences...  Who cares? But when that changes...
Hiccup::: Heather?
Dagur::: She's blood, Hiccup! Which makes her even closer than you and me.
Hiccup::: Changewing!
Hiccup::: What?
Dagur::: A little something I picked up along the way.
Dagur::: Okay, now we need the branch of a Fire Fern. It's the long, red plant underneath the big Elm tree. Just make sure that you don't...
Dagur::: ...touch it with your bare hands!
Hiccup::: Thanks for the early warning!
Dagur::: Uh, I gotta work on that! Give it here! Get, c'mon! Can't take you anywhere! Keep it in the water. Hey, next ingredient! Fresh water! So, you wanna tell me why you're out there on your own?
Hiccup::: Not really. Let's just say you aren't the only one who changed after Viggo Grimborn.
Dagur::: That stuff can kill you from the inside, Hiccup! Revenge, anger, obsession... Trust me, I know! It can make you do things you never thought you were capable of! Cause you to take chances, make mistakes! If that doesn't end you, it'll eat away at you slowly. You'll live!
Hiccup::: Are you sure?
Dagur::: Yes, I'm sure! Purple Oleander! You always nag like this? Kidding!  Sense of humor? No? Sense of humor, hmm?
Hiccup::: Blue Oleander can kill a dragon. How, how is purple any different?
Dagur::: Well, for one thing!
Hiccup::: Please don't say It's purple!
Dagur::: I was going to say nature! It's always a great mistery, Hiccup! Think Heather and I! We're brother and sister and yet we are very different!
Hiccup::: I must be out of my mind to go along with any of this!
Dragon Hunter::: My face!
Dagur::: Uh, that feels good!
Dagur::: I told you! I've changed!
Hiccup::: What was that for?
Dagur::: Huh? Stuck right in there, look at the way it's... I got a little...
Dagur::: Ah! Wow! Wuh! Those were some crazy dreams!
Hiccup::: You'll live!
Dagur::: You... did this, for me? I, I don't know what to say! Nobody has never... ah!
Hiccup::: Dagur, it was the last I could do! Think of it as a payback for... well, everything!
Hiccup::: Was just about to give it to him!
Dagur::: Needs more purple! Definitely! There! That should do it! Hey, we can always wait for the effect of the arrows to wear off and hope they don't find us before then, but that could take quite a while! It's up to you, Hiccup! But I would suggest you lose your paranoia. It's a terrible existence! And it's not you!
Hiccup::: Here you go, bud. It's okay! It's okay! Toothless, are you okay? Toothless!  What did you do?  C'mon, C'mon, stay with me, bud!  YOU STAY AWAY FROM HIM!
Dagur::: Hiccup, I didn't know! You have to believe me!
Hiccup::: I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
Dagur::: I didn't hurt your...
Dragon Hunter 1::: We're going to find that dragon, so it's only a matter of time. Why don't you make it easier, on everyone? Maybe this will burn a hole in your memory.
Dragon Hunter 2::: This way!
Dragon Hunter 1::: Now, you'll be part of the dragon hunters forever!
Dagur::: Okay! Enough! Enough! I'll take you to the Night Fury!
Hiccup::: No, Dagur!
Dragon Hunter::: Take a few more men with you! Just in case!
Hiccup::: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Dagur::: Sorry, brother! You'd just slow me down!
Hiccup::: YOU'RE A FAKE, DAGUR! A FAKE! I HATE YOU! YOU HEAR ME? I HATE YOU!
Dragon Hunter::: Forget him! He's worthless! This one will take us to the Night Fury. We'll come for Dagur later, put an end to his miserable life.
Dragon Hunter::: Last checks! You wanna help that dragon? Help yourself?
Hiccup::: I'll die before I talk!
Dragon Hunter::: Then die you shall! Viggo will see to that. Take him! Move!
Hiccup::: What?
Dagur::: Easy dragon!
Hiccup::: Bud! It's good to see you too!
Dagur::: I have no idea how you stomach that!
Hiccup::: Oh, Toothless! It's good to have you back! Now what do you say we show him how it's done?
Hiccup::: TOOTHLESS! BARREL ROLL, MULTIPLE BLAST!
Hiccup::: They're so much tougher when they have you chained up, huh bud?
Hiccup::: Wait! Where he go?
Hiccup::: Yeah, we owe him one! Besides, maybe he'll get to Viggo before we do.
Dagur::: Hiccup, tell Heather I'm coming for her!
