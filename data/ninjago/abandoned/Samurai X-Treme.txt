([[Jay]] and [[Nya]] prepares for a sparring session.)

'''Jay''': I am not gonna go easy on you just because you're my girl.

'''Nya''': I wouldn't want you to, Sparky. In fact, let's make this interesting. Loser does the dishes tonight.

'''Jay''': Do the dishes? Wow, major stakes, [[Elemental Masters|Master]] of [[Water]]. (Nya groans.) But you are on. (They start attacking each other.)

'''Nya''': Water!

'''Jay''': Lightning! (Jay is defeated.) Ugh. Ow! (Laughs.) Girl, I haven't taken a beating from you like that since, hm, since you were in that thing. (He points to a mural of Nya's [[Samurai Mech]].)

'''Nya''': Samurai X Mech. I love that thing. Can't believe how big and clunky it was, though. If I designed it today, I would make it a lot sweeter. It's like [[Metalonia]] alloy and carbon frame would make it both durable and allow much greater flight maneuverability. And third generation nitro boosters to the boot. Shoulder-mounted cannons, something for every taste. Improving its urban passifications, trap and control capabilities. Laser-sharpened wrist-mounted shinobi blades for efficient and supplement of hooligans. And of course, triple hardened titanium katana, to deal with those numbskulls who wanna pick a bone with you. Also, a twelve hundred watt high fly subwoofer enhanced speaker system. Just to add a bit of flare in showmanship...What?!

'''Nya and Jay''': (They hear a bell.) Dinner!

'''Nya''': Don't forget, you're doing the dishes.

'''Jay''': Aw, man.
