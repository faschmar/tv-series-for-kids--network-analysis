''(Thunder rumbles in the background as a samurai travels through the fog on a boat.)''

'''[[Dragon keeper]]:''' Long ago, when time still had a name, the [[ninja]] protected those who could not protect themselves, and stood up to those who were cruel and unjust.

''(The samurai exits the boat and makes his way towards a golden light, passing through the deserted ruins of several notable locations as the narration continues.)''

'''Dragon keeper''': Now, the ninja are the ones that need saving, and I swear on my honor that I will provide it. I see the twisted place this world has become. Once, [[Ninjago]] was a thing of beauty — awe-inspiring buildings, majestic statues, sacred temples. Now, all this corruption, and it makes my heart sink to see it. It makes it hard to carry on, but I have to endure. Because the day the chosen ones return, all will be restored and the true potential of this world will once again be achieved.

''(The samurai stops at a tall structure made of large broken chunks of wood. He fires a grappling hook and begins to climb towards the golden light. Suddenly, a dragon appears and attacks the samurai, who defends himself with a sword.)''

'''Dragon keeper''': The enemy is here.

''(The samurai quickly makes his way to the top of the structure, where the light — now revealed to be golden statues of the ninja — originates. The dragon chases him to the top, and they engage in battle. The samurai strikes the dragon off the structure, but as he makes his way towards the ninja, it returns and impales him through the chest with its tail, releasing a giant wave of energy that emanates through the deserted lands.)''

'''Dragon keeper''': Another attacker defeated, but the enemy keeps returning, sending more at me. ''(It turns away from the edge of the structure and circles the frozen ninja.)'' I cannot yield. I must protect my masters. I only hope that they awake soon, but until that day I must remain strong, defend them tirelessly and hope that the time of the ninja is soon at hand. ''(Eyes closed, it disappears in a puff of smoke.)'' And the world will awaken new, and time again will have a name. ''(A small crack appears on one of the ninja, with a bright light shining out of it. The scene then cuts to black.)''
