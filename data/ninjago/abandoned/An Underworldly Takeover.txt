''(The episode begins at the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu]] with [[Cole]] entering a room where [[Wu]] is drinking his [[tea]].)''

'''Cole''': Sensei... I've been thinking.

'''Wu''': Yes?

'''Cole''': How did [[Garmadon]] gain control over the [[Underworld]]'s [[Skulkin|Skeleton Army]]?

'''Wu''': Hmm... Garmadon and I were brothers and the best of friends, but then he turned, and fell.

----

''(In a flashback, Garmadon is shown to be fighting Wu, but gets charred and falls to the Underworld.)''

'''Garmadon''': I curse you, Wu! I will be back one day and the [[Golden Weapons|Weapons of Spinjitzu]] will be mine!

''(A group of skeleton Warriors surround him while [[Samukai]] approaches him.)''

'''Samukai''': Well, if it isn't Garmadon. My my, how you've changed. Where is your pathetic brother, Wu?

'''Garmadon''': That name no longer holds any meaning for me!

'''Samukai''': That may be, but I knew your sorry bones would find a way into my domain one day. ''(Wielding daggers.)'' Guess what, it's payback time!

'''Garmadon''': You're quite right. It is ''payback'' time.

'''Samukai''': You dare challenge me?!

'''Garmadon''': Oh, but I do!

'''Samukai''': You fool! I will crush you!

'''Garmadon''': We will see about that!

''(A fight between the two commences.)''

'''Samukai''': ''(Infuriated.)'' Time to end this charade!

'''Garmadon''': Indeed!

''(Garmadon uses [[Spinjitzu]] to defeat and dethrone Samukai.)''

'''Garmadon''': I think there'll be some changes in management around here. ''(He dons Samukai's [[Underworld helmet|helmet]] and laughs evilly.)''

----

''(Back in reality, Sensei Wu is shaken about the flashback Cole just reminded him of.)''

'''Cole''': So how did Garmadon gain control over the Underworld?

'''Wu''': ''(Diverting the flashback.)'' I don't know. I expect they just sat down and agreed over a nice cup of tea.

''(The episode ends.)''
