(The [[ninja]] are in the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu|Monastery]] talking to [[Wu]].)

'''[[Kai]]''': I don't get it Master. Why do we need a [[Spinjitzu]] lesson now? We're golden! Real [[True Potential]] stuff. Check me out! Jump up, kick back, whip around, and spi—ahhg!

(Kai falls on his face.)

'''Wu''': Golden? Haha! There's more to Spinjitzu than spinning, kicking, and whipping. You have yourself just perfectly illustrated why it is high time for a reminder. Maybe we start with—Balance, in Spinjitzu, as well as in life.

(The ninja are just outside the monastery, balancing on poles.)

'''Wu''': Balance is key. A perfect key balance center will sharpen your mind as well as your body.

(Jay falls off of his pole and the ninja are looking off the mountain onto a cloud, which Wu seems to be walking on.)

'''Wu''': Fear is a ninja's greatest enemy. It will hold you back from true greatness. Do not fear what you do not understand.

(The ninja join Wu on the cloud.)

'''Wu''': Rid you heart of fear and you will feel light as a feather.

(The cloud moves away, revealing a small ledge that the ninja are standing on. The ninja are back inside the Monastery.)

'''Wu''': Focus. (Jay is focused on [[Nya]], causing Wu to throw an apple at him.) Focus on your adversary no matter how insignificant. (Wu begins throwing fruit at all the ninja, and they chop it up.) Make its strength your strength, and an enemy can be turned into a friend. And that's lunch.

(The ninja are outside eating the fruit, and Wu pours some [[tea]].)

'''Wu''': Rotation, balance, harmony. The keys to unlock the full power of Spinjitzu.

(The ninja are back inside)

'''Wu''': Two teams! Ninja sharpens ninja, my [[First Spinjitzu Master|father]] always said. A ninja needs friends. Now spin! Put your trust in others. Let Spinjitzu unite you and become your core. Let it bring you together, and you will truly become one. (The ninja knock over a bowl of golden paint and cover Wu and Kai.) I think this concludes the lesson for today. We are golden.

'''Kai''': Hey, I was gonna say that!
