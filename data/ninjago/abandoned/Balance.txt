''(Underground, [[Cole]] and the ninja fall through a portal.)''

'''Cole''': Where am I?

''(They see three dragons ahead of them. The [[Legendary Dragon|green one]] roars.)''

'''[[Kai]]''': Master [[Wu]]! ''(He runs forward, but [[Nya]] pulls him back.)''

'''Nya''': Look, Kai! Lava! And it's rising.

''(The green dragon opens a portal and leaves, while the red one and the blue one stay behind.)''

'''[[Lloyd]]''': Okay. To save Master Wu, we just have to get through that other portal before it closes.

'''Nya''': And let's not forget about the two dragons waiting for us after that. Those dragons don't look friendly.

''(Lloyd spots some handholds on the wall.)''

'''Lloyd''': I've got it! ''(He leaps onto the handholds and nearly falls.)''

'''[[Jay]]''': I think that's a dead end, Lloyd! I got a better idea! ''(He leaps onto some chains on the ceiling and tries to swing onto a stalactite, but fails.)'' Whoa!

'''[[Zane]]''': Logic would dictate that one of these two options will succeed, given no additional variables.

''(Suddenly, [[Pyro Whippers]] appear and start to attack the ninja.)''

'''Cole''': Additional variables. Additional variables!

'''Nya''': The heat's evaporating any water. I can't use my power!

'''Kai''': I'm not gonna have that problem! ''(He attacks them with fire, but they spit the fire back.)''

'''Nya''': Yeah, you have a whole different problem! These things love fire!

'''Zane''': I may have a clear path! ''(He lands on a flat surface in the lava, but Jay lands next to him, nearly knocking him off.)''

'''Jay''': Er, my path was not so clear!

'''Lloyd''': I think I've got it. ''(He leaps ahead, but leaps away to dodge the [[Lava Monsters|Lava Monster]]'s attack.)'' Now what? Giant lava monster. Sure, why not?

''(Cole looks at his teammates in danger and the enemies surrounding them.)''

'''Cole''': It's too much. I have to ... find balance.

''(He has a flashback about [[Lilly|his]] [[Lou|parents]] dancing in the [[dance class]]. He then begins to fight, swiftly dodging all the attacks and destroying the lava monster.)''

'''Cole''': I can't believe that worked. Okay, dragons. You're next. Let's go! ''(He prepares to attack, only for the dragons to lick him playfully.)'' Whoa! Huh? So, we're friends? Okay. And I need your help. Can I get a lift? ''(The dragons carry the ninja through the portal.)'' Let's get out of here! We need to find Master Wu!

''(Behind the ninja and the dragons, the portal closes.)''
