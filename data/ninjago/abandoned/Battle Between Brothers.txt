''(The episode begins at the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu]] with [[Zane]] approaching [[Wu]], who is wearing a new {{suit|black kimono}}.)''

'''Zane''': Ooh, Sensei Wu. Your kimono is most extraordinary.

'''Wu''': Thank you, Zane. Yes, it is quite extraordinary. Its symbols act as a protection spell against evil. But ultimately, it serves to remind me of the night that [[Garmadon]] was cast into the [[Underworld]].

----

''(A flashback shows a young Garmadon trying to steal the four [[Golden Weapons]] when a young Wu catches him in the act.)''

'''Wu''': I'm afraid those are for display only.

''(Garmadon slowly turns around to Wu. His skin is pale and have red eyes, having succumbed [[Great Devourer's venom]].)''

'''Garmadon''': Hmm... tell me, what good is a weapon if all it's used for collecting dust?

'''Wu''': Don't be a fool! [[First Spinjitzu Master|Father]] warned that their power's beyond any one manâ€”

'''Garmadon''': ''(exclaims)'' Father was the fool!

'''Wu''': How dare you speak so lowly of Father! We made him a promise. These weapons shall not leave this [[Monastery of Spinjitzu|Monastery]]!

'''Garmadon''': Then I shall destroy it, and all who stand in my way!

''(The fight commences as Garmadon uses the [[Sword of Fire]] to attack Wu, who fortunately used his [[Bo staff|bamboo stick]] to protect himself as the [[fire]]ball deflects to the rest of the Golden Weapons. Wu then picks up the [[Scythe of Quakes]] and the [[Shurikens of Ice]] while Garmadon wields the Sword of Fire and the [[Nunchucks of Lightning]]. The fight commences outside after Wu used the power of the Scythe of Quakes to knock down Garmadon.)''

'''Wu''': Put those weapons down!

'''Garmadon''': You mean like this?

''(As Garmadon tries to put down Wu, Wu defends himself with the weapons he is holding. The combined power of the four weapons ends up summoning a dark thunderstorm with Garmadon gaining the upper hand.)''

'''Garmadon''': ''(Preparing to kill Wu.) ''Goodbye, Brother.

'''Wu''': Garmadon! Do not do this!

''(As Garmadon is about to slash Wu with the Sword of Fire, the symbols on Wu's kimono start glowing and the reflection of the light reaches the clouds, which causes a bolt of [[lightning]] to strike Garmadon, charring his skin in the process and makes him fall to the Underworld. Wu tries to save Garmadon, but is unsuccessful.)''

'''Wu''': No!

----

'''Wu''': ''(Back to reality.)'' After Garmadon's fall, the balance of the elements was restored and [[Ninjago]] enjoyed many years of peace.

'''[[Jay]]''': ''(Riding the [[Wisp|Lightning Dragon]], now named Wisp.)'' Woo hoo! Sensei, look! No hands!

'''Zane''': ''(After witnessing the way Jay was riding on his [[Dragons|Dragon]].)'' Apparently, those days are over.

'''Wu''': ''(Laughs.)'' More or less.

''(The episode ends.)''
