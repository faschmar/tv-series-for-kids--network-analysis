Cole::: Earth! 
Kai:::Whoo-hoo!
Jay::: Lightning! 
Zane::: Ice! 
Nya::: Good training. Your powers are getting stronger. But where's Kai?
Kai::: Fire! Unlock Fire! Uh, Fire go! Shoot flames! Oh, come on. Everyone else can do it. So can you. Bring heat! 
Cole::: Very nice. Perhaps if you tried the phrase "Fire dork," maybe it might work.
Kai:::How long have you all been watching?
Jay::: The Green Ninja suit. That's awesome!
Kai::: Well, I was looking for some kind of clue from Sensei and then I found this.
Zane::: But you know only he who is foretold to face Lord Garmadon is destined to be the Green Ninja, and only he should wear the Green Ninja outfit. So Sensei would most likely be very—
Kai::: I know, I know. But I thought if I just tried it on, it might help me see my True Potential. It's not fair that you guys have unlocked your cool powers and I still haven't. Besides, Sensei's gone and we don't know when he's coming back — 
Wu::: Hello? I'm home.
All but Kai::: Sensei! 
Wu::: Ah. It's so good to be home.
Zane::: So glad you're back.
Cole::: Did you bring us anything?
Jay::: Oh, Sensei, have you missed a lot. Zane's a Nindroid, Nya's the mysterious Samurai, Cole's a dancer—
Wu::: Zane is a...what?
Zane::: You've been gone a while. We'll catch you up later. But you should know, all of us except for Kai have discovered our True Potential.
Wu::: Have you now? Where is Kai?
Kai:::Right here. So glad you're back safe.Aah! Sensei, behind you! 
Zane:::Sensei!
Kai::: Ugh! He's got four arms.
Garmadon::: So we meet again.
Kai::: He must've followed you, Sensei!
Wu::: Kai, stop! He is the reason I left. For so long as Pythor has Lloyd, he will be our guest.
Cole:::We have to live with this guy?
Zane:::But Sensei, he has four arms!
Jay::: Uh, must I remind you ever since he turned evil, he's been trying to get our Golden Weapons?
Wu:::Enough!
All::: Yes, Sensei.
Garmadon::: This isn't about the weapons. It's about my son.
Wu::: From here on out, you will obey me and you will respect my brother.
All::: Yes, Sensei.
Wu::: Now to the bridge. We must put our attention to more pressing matters.So, where are we at with the four Fangblades?
Jay::: Oh, Pythor's managed to take the first two, but there's still two left.
Cole::: And we only need one in order to prevent him from unleashing the Great Devourer.
Wu::: Any luck finding their whereabouts?
Zane::: No, but the Falcon is programmed to alert us if he sees any suspicious activity.
Wu::: Good. If we find the Fangblade, we find Lloyd. Kai and Nya, prepare the deck and double check the anchor. We need to be ready when we first get word of activity.
Kai and Nya::: Yes, Sensei.
Kai:::I have my eye on you. 
Wu::: Jay, did you say the Falcon was...programmed?
Jay::: Haha. Okay, Sensei. I don't know where to start. It all started when we saw the Falcon, and then we ran after it... 
Kai::: But Nya, did you see he has four arms? Wherever Sensei found him, he's now made it possible so that he can possess all four weapons at once. I don't trust him. Not one bit.
Nya::: You have to remember, he's not just the Dark Lord, he's also Sensei's brother. Though he's pure evil, Sensei holds him close to his heart.
Kai::: That's it.
Nya::: What?
Kai::: To unlock my power. Sensei said the heart is the key. Maybe if I stand up to Lord Garmadon, I'll find my True Potential and then everyone can see I'm the Green Ninja! Ha! Nya, you are a genius!
Nya::: I don't quite follow your logic—
Kai::: No time to explain. I have to go train. If I'm gonna confront Garmadon soon,I gotta be at the top of my game.
Nya::: But Sensei said he's our guest.
Kai::: Garmadon might've fooled Sensei, but don't think for a second I'm not keeping my eye on him. Nya, the Lord of Darkness just became our roommate!
Cole::: What's he eating?
Kai::: Condensed evil. Supposed to be low in fat.
Man:::Goodbye, my darling. 
Zane::: Where's Garmadon?
Kai:::Sunbathing.
Kai::: Do you have to do that? We're trying to sleep. 
Kai::: He's not even playing the game right. He's just shooting and destroying things.
Zane::: I've noticed when he isn't so focused on trying to turn Ninjago into his own image, he's actually quite fascinating.
Cole::: Sure, four arms are freakish, but all in all, he doesn't seem that bad of a guy.
Kai::: He might be pulling the wool over all your eyes, but not mine. He's up to something. And I'm gonna be ready for it.
Kai::: Garmadon, get ready to get Kai'd! Fire!Wham, bam, sorry to beat you, man!
Wu:::This way. Come, come.I have come to understand the mysterious Samurai is no longer a mystery.
Nya::: Oh yeah, you heard about that. I guess I picked up a thing or two.
Wu::: It was foolish of me to think that a girl could not be the destined Green Ninja. 
Kai:::Nya's the Green Ninja?
Wu::: When the four weapons are laid out before the destined one, the weapons will react, revealing the identity of the Green Ninja.
Nya::: But, Sensei...
Wu::: Approach the weapons.
Garmadon::: What are you doing out here?
Kai::: Whoa!What are you doing out here?
Garmadon::: Evil never sleeps.
Kai::: Yeah, well, good never rests.
Garmadon::: Maybe we should take care of this right now.
Kai::: I was hoping you'd say that. 
Nya::: Guys, guys, what are you doing out here?
Garmadon::: Perhaps you should be asking Mr. Snoopy Pants that question.
Nya::: Kai, were you spying on me?
Kai::: What? No way! I was, uh, keeping watch. So are you the Green Ninja?
Nya::: What? Of course not.
Kai::: So the weapons didn't tell you. Ah, that means I still have a chance.
Wu::: Truth is, she never wanted to know.
Nya::: At first, all I wanted was to be like you, but after seeing how obsessed you've become and discovered what I could do on my own, I'm happy being a Samurai.
Kai::: So then who's the Green Ninja?
Wu::: Perhaps we will never know. 
Jay::: Kai, you were supposed to be in the bridge. Zane's Falcon spotted them.
Nya::: Looks like Pythor is at the Temple of Fire.
Kai::: That means the Fangblade is there.
Garmadon::: And Lloyd.
Jay::: That's the same Fire Temple where Kai and Lord Garmadon first faced off.
Kai::: If my memory serves me correct, I'd say one of us cheated back when we last fought.
Garmadon::: And I remember someone needing their Sensei to save them.
Cole::: Guys! For the sake of the Fangblade and Lloyd, can we please just get along?
Nya::: Since the last time we've been there, it looks like the volcano has grown unstable. The place is a powder keg just waiting to blow up. This will be a highly combustible environment.
Jay::: Oh, great. Just what I like. Fighting armed and deadly snakes in a highly combustible environment about to blow up!
Wu::: We will do what we must.
Zane::: Yes, Sensei. But where are our weapons?
Kai::: And why is Lord Garmadon not here? 
Wu::: Kai!
Kai:::I knew I couldn't trust you, you thief!
Garmadon::: Foolish child. I look forward to teaching you a lesson.
Kai::: This ends now!
Garmadon::: Indeed!
Kai::: Ninja, go!I'm alive. I'm alive!
Garmadon::: You need to be taught a lesson!
Nya::: Kai? You in here?What are you doing?
Kai:::Discovering my True Potential!
Jay::: Unh! The door won't budge!
Nya::: Kai thinks he'll unlock his power if he stands up to Lord Garmadon.
Zane::: Why would he think that?
Nya:::'Cause he thinks he's the Green Ninja!
Cole::: Well, if we don't open this door soon, I think he's gonna be mincemeat. Stand back!Earth. 
Kai::: I defeated him. I did it! Are my eyes glowing? Did I unlock my powers? Is this my True Potential? Argh! Why isn't it working?
Wu::: Because you cannot defeat someone who allowed himself to be defeated.
Garmadon::: I wasn't going to hurt you, boy. I was only fetching your weapons.
Kai::: But you were trying to steal them!
Wu:::I asked him to get them. Perhaps it is best you do not reach your True Potential, or else someone could get hurt.
Cole::: Way to go, hero.
Nya::: Oh. Poor thing. Let me help you.
Garmadon::: Yes. Poor thing. 
Cole::: Sounds like we've finally reached our destination.
Cole::: The Fire Temple.
Nya:::The volcano seems to be on the verge of eruption, guys. All recent indicators tell me that this place is becoming increasingly fragile. Even the smallest rupture can make the whole thing go off.
Wu::: Then we must not use our weapons. 
Nya::: Kai.
Kai::: ) Yeah, yeah. No Fire Sword. But only because I wouldn't want anything to prevent us from getting that Fangblade.
Garmadon::: Or my son.
Wu::: There. The Serpentine must be inside the inner core. From here on out, we travel by shadows.
Garmadon::: It's the only way I know how. 
Jay::: There's Lloyd. 
Garmadon:::Son.
Pythor::: Huh?Out of my way, fool!The third Fangblade is ours!Ninja? Attack!
Wu::: Light as a leaf. Attack like there is no tomorrow.
Jay::: Wind! 
Zane::: Ice! 
Nya::: Kai, the weapon is compromising our safety.
Kai::: I will do what I must.
Pythor::: Let's get out of here! But not before we leave them with a parting gift. Boys? 
Zane::: They're making the volcano unstable.
Jay::: Any minute, this place is gonna blow. We have to get out of here.
Garmadon::: Not without my son.
Lloyd::: Dad!
Pythor::: Argh, lose the boy! 
Lloyd::: Dad!
Garmadon::: Lloyd! 
Lloyd::: Dad. 
Garmadon::: Son. 
Kai:::The Fangblade's mine!
Cole::: Come back. It's too dangerous. The whole place is going to explode!
Kai::: Then I better be quick! 
Skales::: Hurry, we must leave here at once. 
Jay::: Leave it, Kai! It's not worth your life!
Kai::: Not without that Fangblade!
Lloyd::: But what about Kai? Kai? 
Garmadon::: No! Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Dad! Dad! I'm sinking!
Kai::: It, unh, won't budge. 
Wu::: We have to get out of here, or else none of us will get out of here.
Garmadon::: But my son! 
Kai::: Come on, why won't my power unlock?
Lloyd::: Kai! Help me! 
Kai::: Come on. Let's get out of here.
Lloyd::: But the Fangblade.
Kai::: Forget it. This place is coming apart. Ninja, go! 
Garmadon::: Lloyd! Lloyd! 
Nya::: Kai.
Garmadon::: Son. 
Jay::: It's Kai! He's found his True Potential! 
Lloyd::: Dad? Is it really you?
Garmadon::: It is, son.
Lloyd::: Dad? Why do you have four arms?
Cole::: He's gonna be okay. 
Garmadon::: Thank you, Kai.
Zane::: But how did you survive? How did you discover the key to unlocking your powers?
Kai::: I knew when I had to make a choice. I wanted the Fangblade so badly, to prove I was good enough to become the Green Ninja. But then I figured it out. All of my training to become the best ninja wasn't in preparation to become the Green Ninja. It was... to protect him. 
Lloyd::: What? What is everybody looking at me for?
Nya::: That means... 
Wu::: Lloyd is the Green Ninja. I had thought it would be one of you, but it was him the whole time. It all makes sense. Not only have you four been chosen to protect the Golden Weapons, but also to protect the Chosen One. 
Garmadon:::That means...
Wu::: The battle lines have been drawn, brother. Sadly, our family has only become more divided. Brother versus brother, and now, son versus father. 
Jay::: Hehe, this is heavy and all, but whatever happened to the Fangblade!?
Pythor::: Ah, it's so beautiful. Cool and clean it off, boys. Because we've only got one more to go.
