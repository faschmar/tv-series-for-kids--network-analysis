Past Harumi:::At last, the Sword of Fortune!Not so fast, ninja. I am the Shadow Thief, and I'll never let you have it.Then we battle because ninja never quit. Hyah! 
Past Harumi's father::: What was that? 
Past Harumi's father::: We need to leave now.
Past Harumi::: But...
Past Harumi's father:::We'll take the stairwell. 
Past Harumi::: Where are the stairs? 
Man::: There's no room. Take the next one. 
Past Harumi's father::: Please, take her.
Past Harumi::: No! I want to stay with you. Please! I want to stay. Mama. 
Past Harumi's mother::: We'll-We'll see you when we get down. I promise. 
Past Paramedic #1::: Hmm. So much for the ninja.
Past Paramedic #2:::Did you see that thing? Lord Garmadon single-handedly destroyed it. He's the real hero.
Past Paramedic #1::: Brave little girl you are. Where are your parents, child? Do you have a name? Well, aren't you the quiet one.
Lloyd::: The my share of deadly tombs. Follow my every step. 
Harumi::: Lloyd.
Lloyd:::Okay. Don't touch anything with that symbol on it.What's happening?
Harumi::: I don't know. I didn't touch anything.
Lloyd::: Rumi, the exit. 
Harumi::: No. No, no, no, no, no.
Lloyd:::Guess there's no turning back now.
Cole::: If you harm one hair on his head...
Killow::: You'll what? Where is he? Where's the Green Ninja?
Cole::: Ha. Like we'll ever tell you.
Jay::: Uh, Cole, you don't argue with a man whose navel is that close.
Mohawk::: Mr. E found them.
Killow::: Good eye, Mr. E. The Oni Temple is just fifteen miles north of here. Set a course for the Quiet One.
Nya::: You don't have to call her that. We know it's Harumi.
Kai::: Do you guys have any idea what you're doing? She's planning on resurrecting Garmadon. Lord Garmadon. I'm gonna guess you never had the chance to meet him.
Killow::: No, but we look forward to it.
Zane::: In our experience, when the bad guys try to unearth an ancient evil, it never ends well for them.
Jay::: Yeah. Just ask Master Chen, Morro, or even Garmadon himself.
Ultra Violet::: Hmm, then it's a good thing the Quiet One isn't a bad guy, but a bad girl.Careful, ninja. I wouldn't want to upset the child.
Cole::: Let's just hope Lloyd discovers Harumi's secret before her help arrives.
Lloyd::: Almost there. You okay?
Harumi::: Yes, but it's hard to see.What is this place? 
Lloyd::: It's their story.
Harumi::: Who?
Lloyd::: The Oni. See there? It's amazing.
Harumi::: They must have built this place.
Lloyd::: When the First Spinjitzu Master escaped their world, they must have come looking for him.
Harumi::: Who?
Lloyd::: The Oni. He was the key to winning their eternal war with the Dragons. Ninjago was a new world to them. The Oni must've holed up here. Explains all the traps. Must not have wanted any visitors.This is a dead end.
Harumi::: Look, the symbol from earlier. Maybe you can break through one of these walls. If the symbol is on here, this one must be booby trapped.
Lloyd::: Hmm. Worth a shot. 
Harumi::: What's wrong?
Lloyd::: If the Oni wanted to protect the mask, they would know anyone who got this far would avoid the markings.
Harumi::: What do you mean?
Lloyd::: This has to be the way.
Harumi::: But you see the water? If you break the wrong wall, this whole room will flood.
Lloyd::: Mm-hmm. Then I sure hope I'm right.Ha. Let's go.
Harumi:::The Mask of Hatred.Only someone with Oni blood can take the mask.Can I...Can I see it?I just want to see it.
Lloyd::: How did you know?
Harumi:::It's an Oni Temple. It's safe to assume only an Oni could take it.
Lloyd::: No. How could you know that I was part Oni?
Harumi::: You're related to the First Spinjitzu Master. He was an Oni.
Lloyd::: I never told you that. Jay and I were alone when Mystake told us the story. You were never there.
Harumi::: Then I must've heard it from Jay. 
Lloyd::: I don't want to believe it. You're the Quiet One?
Harumi::: How could you say that?
Lloyd:::It all makes sense now. "The greatest villain is the one you never knew was there in the first place." You said that.
Harumi::: Oh, yes. I'm the criminal mastermind. How could I have done this?Do you realize how silly you're sounding?I...I love you. 
Lloyd:::Stay back.
Harumi:::Lloyd.
Lloyd:::You only wanted me to get the mask you couldn't find.
Harumi::: I didn't need you to find the mask. It would've already been mine had your idiot friends not stolen Wu from us.
Lloyd:::The baby is Master Wu?
Harumi::: Oh, that's right. You didn't know.I knew to keep you close. Not everything goes to plan. Give me the mask. 
Lloyd:::No.I can't let you bring my father back. Not like that.
Harumi::: Well, then if you won't give it to me... Hua-yah!Then I will take it!Aagghhh!!Oh. 
Lloyd::: Why? 
Harumi::: I never asked to be a princess.Just as I never asked to be an orphan, but you gifted me that.Oh.
Lloyd::: How did I do that?
Harumi::: The Great Devourer. It was too strong.Too big for you and your friends.Oh, Lloyd. You aren't so naive to think no one got hurt that day, did you?It wasn't until the almighty Lord Garmadon saved the day! But he couldn't save my family.It was too late. I died that day, too. 
Lloyd:::Give me one reason not to say goodbye to it right now.
Harumi:::I'll give you two. You want to see your father again, and you love me.Ah, your emotions. You can't get rid of them. It's hard to think, isn't it?I felt those feelings too.We truly are kindred spirits.Arugh!
Lloyd::: You helped put the bug on the ship. You caused the crash.
Harumi::: A calculated risk. Your friends were so close to the truth. I couldn't let them stop me.
Lloyd::: Feeding the poor, acting scared? It was all an act?
Harumi::: Ah, yes. The damsel in distress. You ninja really are from another time.
Lloyd::: The Emperor and Empress?
Harumi::: They were never my parents! To protect Ninjago, I had to repress those feelings. I had to wear a mask until the time came for me to take control. I had to be smarter, stronger.
Lloyd::: You were never protecting Ninjago. You were only after revenge.
Harumi::: Tell me, Lloyd, how many times has Ninjago almost fallen on your watch? How many times have you ninja failed and let others pay the price? You're not our protectors. You're just a bunch of little kids playing dress up. Ninjago is my home too. And with your father by my side, we can return it to glory. Give it the leader it truly des—
Lloyd::: Then... I guess this is goodbye.Okay, so that didn't go as planned.
Harumi::: This isn't going to be a fair fight. 
Lloyd::: What did the mask do to you?
Harumi:::The Mask of Hatred. A taste of invincibility. Too bad for you. 
Kai::: I've got an itch. You mind coming over here to scratch it?
Ultra Violet::: Shut it, Hair Gel. 
Chopper Maroon::: Get off me. 
Nya::: Huh.
Killow::: I can't break through. It looks like we wait.
Son of Garmadon::: Eh, what if the Green Ninja returns with the mask first?
Killow::: The Quiet One will not fail.
Lloyd::: Hurt me all you want, but I'm never gonna let you get away with this.
Harumi:::Physical pain can only hurt so much. I intend far worse.
Lloyd:::Then what do you want?
Harumi:::I want you to feel the emptiness that I feel! When your father is reborn, he won't be the man you recognize! His soul will be gone and I want his cold hands to destroy you!
Lloyd::: You're a monster! I'll never feel what you feel.
Harumi:::We will see.
Lloyd::: Fight me. Let's end it here.
Harumi:::I'm already two steps ahead. 
Lloyd::: No. Don't!Where's Nya when you need her?
Killow::: Ultra Violet, get over here.
Ultra Violet::: Watch over them for me, will ya? 
Cole::: Glow, little glow worm, glimmer glimmer. Shine, little glow worm, glimmer glimmer.
Chopper Maroon:::Hmm. That song. Again? It ain't gonna work, beef cake.
Cole::: Maybe I just feel like singing. Lead us lest too far we wander...
Chopper Maroon:::Hey, I said knock it off.
Cole::: ...Love's sweet voice calling yonder. Glow, little glow worm... 
Nya:::Psst. The keys.
Cole::: ...glimmer glimmer. Shine, little glow worm, glimmer glimmer....
Nya:::The keys. Get the keys. 
Cole::: ...Shine, little glow worm, glimmer glimmer. Hey there, little glow worm, glimmer glimmer. Lead us lest too far we wander. Love's sweet voice calling yonder. 
Nya:::Not the tea. The keys. There. Please.
Cole::: Glow, little glow worm, glimmer glimmer. Shine, little glow worm, glimmer glimmer. Shine, little glow worm—
Nya::: Oh, thanks, little Wu.
Jay::: Uh-uh.
Killow::: The Quiet One has the mask. We have all three! 
Harumi:::Now I believe we have a ceremony to attend to. Take the ship.
Kai::: Not so fast.
Cole::: Careful. I wouldn't want you to upset the child. 
Jay::: Haha. Looks like we have the upper—Oh, come on. Zane, I thought you said we had them outnumbered.
Zane::: Uh, that was before I knew how many of them there were.
Ultra Violet::: Oh, now isn't this a lovely pickle?
Kai::: Where's Lloyd?
Harumi::: The Green Ninja can't help you now.
Nya::: Remember how I didn't care for her at first? Then she won me over with all that girl talk, and we started to really get to know each other? Well now I hate her!
Zane:::Don't even think about it.
Kai::: This can end one of two ways: either you hand the masks over peacefully—
Jay::: I don't even have to know the rest of the choices. I like that one.
Harumi::: Or what?
Kai::: Or we'll have to get all ninja up on ya.
Harumi::: What does that even mean?
Kai::: I don't know. I was improvising. Usually Lloyd does the talking. But he isn't here. B—Where's Lloyd!? 
Cole::: There he is.
Wu::: Lloyd. 
Lloyd::: You guys, Rumi is the Quiet One.
Kai::: We kind of got that much. 
Killow::: What is that?
Lloyd::: It's back.
Zane::: Over here.
Ultra Violet::: We have to get you out of here, Quiet One.
Harumi::: Not without the masks. 
Jay::: Hey! They're getting away!
Lloyd::: Get me close.
Nya::: I'm on it. Zane, I need an assist. 
Jay::: He did not just—
Kai::: He just did.They have Lloyd.
Cole::: They have the masks. 
Zane::: And we have trouble.
Wu::: Puppy!
