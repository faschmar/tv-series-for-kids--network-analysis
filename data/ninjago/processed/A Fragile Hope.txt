Lloyd::: Zane? I-I don't understand. How is this possible?
Ice Emperor::: What did you call me?
Lloyd::: Zane! Your name is Zane! Don't you remember? 
Vex::: Step back. You are addressing the Ice Emperor.
Lloyd::: I came here for you, Zane. I came here to bring you home.
Ice Emperor::: This... is my home.
Lloyd::: No. Ninjago is your home.
Ice Emperor::: Nin... ja-go?
Lloyd:::Think, Zane. Try to remember. We were all together. We were fighting her staff.
Vex::: Don't listen to him. He lies!
Lloyd::: It's the truth.Zane. You have to remember something! Or... someone. Master Wu, or P.I.X.A.L., or-or... Kai?
Ice Emperor:::Who?
Lloyd::: Kai! Remember when I threw his reds in with your whites and all your clothes turned pink? And you had to dress up as a Pink Ninja? Remember?
Ice Emperor::: No.
Vex::: He seeks to deceive you. To confuse you. Let me deal with him, my Lord. 
Lloyd:::You were holding the Scroll of happened. It-It must have corrupted you somehow. How long have you been here, Zane? How long have you been holding that?
Ice Emperor::: Many... decades. 
Lloyd:::Decades? Time must be different here. I don't understand how but-but... Zane, the Scroll has corrupted you, corrupted your power. You have to put it down! 
Vex::: He seeks the scepter!
Lloyd::: Don't listen to him, Zane! This isn't you! You're a good person! You're my friend. You have to trust me. Put it down!
Vex:::See?! He desires it for himself.Seize him! 
Lloyd::: No!Ah! Ugh!
Vex:::Behold his treachery. One moment he speaks of friendship, and the next, he tries to steal your scepter.Allow me to destroy him, my Lord!
Ice Emperor:::Lock him in the dungeon.
Vex::: But, my Lord!
Ice Emperor::: You heard me! 
Vex::: You heard the Emperor.To the dungeon with him! 
Cole:::Krag? What's wrong?
Nya::: I think he smells something.
Jay:::Like what?Not these guys again! 
Cole::: Krag, don't! There's too many.
Nya::: What do we do?
Jay::: Stay calm. Do exactly what I do.On three. One.Two. Three! 
Kai:::That was your whole plan?!
Nya::: Where are we even running?
Cole:::I... There! Look!
Nya::: The Land Bounty! 
Kai::: Ha! Not this time, guys! 
Nya:::Zap it! 
Kai::: That won't scare them off for long.
Nya::: Better get this tub of bolts working again. Fast!
Prisoner::: Are you awake, my friend?
Lloyd::: Yes. Who are you? 
Prisoner::: A prisoner, like you. What is your name?
Lloyd::: Lloyd.
Prisoner::: Welcome to the Ice Emperor's dungeon, Lloyd. I am Kataru.
Lloyd::: Kataru? Akita's brother? The bear?
Kataru:::How do you know that?
Lloyd::: She told me. She told me all about you.
Kataru:::My sister is gone. She was frozen, along with the rest of my people by the Emperor's Ice dragon. 
Lloyd::: No. No, she's alive! We came across the ice together.
Kataru:::Do you swear it? Do you swear she is alive?
Lloyd::: Yes! She's alive! Actually, she thought you were dead. She thought the dragon took you.
Kataru::: Boreal. It did, but it didn't destroy me. It brought me here, a prize for its master. 
Lloyd::: How long have you been here?
Kataru::: I... I do not know. I made marks at first to keep track of the days and months.But after a while, I gave up. There is no escape from this place.
Lloyd::: There is always a way.
Vex:::Ah, that's the spirit. So hopeful. So confident. But, alas, there are a few troubling details you don't know. Such as the shackles around your hands.They are made of corrupted Ice. If they can prevent a Formling from changing shape, then I think they can also contain your powers.
Lloyd:::You coward! You liar! I don't know how you tricked Zane into believing you, but he'll see through you eventually. He'll see what you are!
Vex::: What I am? I'm his trusted adviser, while you are nothing but a traitor and a rebel spy. And sooner or later, I will deal with you, as I deal with all who stand in my way. 
Kataru::: I am sorry, my friend. I wish I could give you some hope, but there is none in this place.
Lloyd:::There's always hope. Akita's still out there and my friends are out there. And if I know one thing, it's that ninja never quit. They never give up. Ever.
Cole::: Maybe we should just give up?
Krag::: Hmm?
Cole::: I mean Nya's good at fixing things, but this is ridiculous! This vehicle's a goner.
Nya::: Okay, try it again. 
Jay::: Eh-augh! Whatever you're doing, I think you're getting warmer.
Kai::: Definitely warmer. It lit up that time.
Nya::: Okay. Good. I think I got it now. Try it again.
Jay:::Whoa! Ah! Colder. Much colder.
Nya::: Really? Okay, okay. I'm gonna reverse it. Negative to positive, positive to negative. And let's get this out of here. 
Kai::: Uh, don't we need that?
Jay::: Yeah, are you sure you should be just ripping things out like that?
Nya::: If you think you can do better, you're welcome to give it a try. 
Jay:::Nope, uh, you're doing great.
Cole:::What? What's wrong? You smell something?Oh, no!Guys? Guys, we got a problem. They're back!
Jay:::Aw, great.Nya, whatever you're doing, do it faster!
Nya::: And let's get rid of this!I don't even know what that does. 
Kai::: Oh, that was probably just the brakes. Who needs those?
Nya::: Try it now!Rrgh.
Cole::: Krag!This is not good. Not good!
Jay:::Nya, Cole is right! For once!
Cole::: Hey...
Nya::: Come on, you piece of junk!Why won't you just start?! 
Cole:::Krag, get in!Go, go! 
Nya::: Hold on, everyone! We're getting out of here! 
Cole, Jay, Krag:::Woohoo-hoohoohoo! Yeah-haha!
Kataru::: Save your strength, my friend. Ten of you couldn't break those chains.
Lloyd::: There has to be something we can do.
Kataru::: The only way out of this dungeon is if someone lets us out and I do not see that happening anytime soon. 
Lloyd:::You? What are you doing here?
Grimfax::: I'm considering doing something foolish. I'm considering helping you, but I want to know something first. Is it true what you said? That the Emperor was once a good man?
Lloyd::: Yes.
Grimfax::: And you think you can awaken him?
Lloyd::: If I can get that scepter away from him, yes, he'll remember. I know he will. 
Grimfax::: I hope you are right.Because I'm coming over to your side.
Lloyd::: Welcome to the Resistance.
