Akita::: 
Lloyd::: Which way is the Throne Room?
Grimfax::: To the left, but we can't go there yet. There's something we have to take care of first.Hide! 
Akita::: 
Grimfax::: Vex has a corrupted shard of ice. It is all-seeing. So long as he possesses that, there is no hope of victory. We must destroy it first.
Lloyd::: How do you know he isn't watching us right now?
Grimfax::: If he were, we would already be caught.
Kataru::: We better hurry then.
Lloyd::: Which way? 
Jay::: This is a Milton Dyer classic, Krag, so pay attention! We're talking Golden Age here. It's called Lava Zombies and you need major skills to beat this game, which I, heh, luckily have. Watch and learn.No, n—you gotta wait until I lose! It's my turn!You gotta wait, Krag!
Cole::: I don't think he understands, Jay.
Jay::: Well, tell him it's my turn!
Cole::: I don't speak Krag and can I point out you're trying to reason with an eight-foot tall creature who could pancake you with his foot?
Jay:::Good point. Your turn, Krag.Whoa! 
Kai:::Huh? What's that?
Nya::: Something ahead. Some sort of structure. That's it. The Ice Emperor's Castle.
Kai::: Yeah, that definitely looks like a spooky castle where an evil Ice Emperor would live.
Nya::: Better tell the others.
Kai::: Guys, buckle up. We're close. 
Cole::: Krag, you gotta stop playing. We gotta get in our seats.Krag.Don't you growl at me! That is unacceptable! You want me to revoke your video game privileges!
Krag::: 
Cole::: Okay, then. 
Nya::: Got something on radar. Something big, moving fast.
Kai::: What? What is it?
Nya::: Well, it isn't a welcoming committee.
Kai::: I'm on it!Incoming! (He fires a shot and it hits Boreal. Boreal heads straight for them, blasting out his Ice.
Nya:::Kai, do something!
Kai::: Unh! I'm trying!It's not doing anything. Hai-yah!Ahhh! 
Nya:::What was that? What happened? Did you get him?!
Kai:::Uh, not exactly.Ahhh! 
Ninja::: Ahhh!
Jay::: Aah! Dragon, dragon, dragon! 
Ninja::: Ahh!Ahhh! 
Jay:::Nya, what are you doing?! 
Nya::: Hang on, everyone! 
Jay::: We should've worn seatbelts.
Kai::: Everyone okay? Jay, Cole?
Cole::: Can this thing stay fixed for like a day?
Jay::: Uhh... Nya!It's okay, Nya. You can let go.
Nya::: And the dragon?
Jay::: Got him. It's over. 
Lloyd::: You're sure he's not watching us?
Grimfax::: Like I said, if he were watching the Crystal, we wouldn't have gotten this far. 
Vex::: You were saying? 
Grimfax::: Run!
Lloyd::: We have to stay together and—
Grimfax::: No! You must awaken your friend or all is lost! We will hold them back as long as we can!Go! Rrgh! 
Akita:::Unh. Er-unh. 
Akita:::Gah.Aargh!Unh! Ahh!
Ice Emperor:::Who... are you?
Akita::: My name is Akita.
Ice Emperor::: Akita? Another rebel thief?A traitor come to steal my scepter?
Akita::: I came for revenge! 
Ice Emperor::: Revenge? For what?
Akita:::For my brother, Kataru, and for the suffering of my people, the Formlings!
Ice Emperor::: I have heard of the Formlings. Vex told me your people are warmongers, cruel, and barbaric.
Akita::: And you believed him.Aargh!Ungh! 
Lloyd::: It's time we finished this, Zane!
Akita::: Zane?
Ice Emperor::: Hmm.
Lloyd:::Once... and for all.
