Cole::: Look at that.
Kai::: Awesome.
Karlof::: Let me see. 
Kai::: Do you mind?
Garmadon::: The pleasure is all mine, Clouse.
Clouse::: I'm sure it is.
Jay::: Definitely feeling some tension between you two.
Kai::: Yeah, and how is it we're on an island I've never seen on any map?
Cole::: And care to explain how the face to noodle house is secretly assembling an underground fighting tournament?
Garmadon::: Master Chen used to be a friend. Now he's a traitor. During the snakes.
Garmadon::: He used deception to divide the Elemental Masters. We barely defeated the criminal empire from here.
Lloyd::: He may have divided our ancestors, but he's not gonna divide us.
Kai:::Uh...ladies first.Fire will melt her icy heart. Just wait.
Cole::: This is a big island. Zane could be anywhere. Keep an eye out.
Jay::: So this is the house that noodles built. Ha! Always wanted to go to a red carpet event.
Garmadon::: Chen lives like a king. Here, he's totally self-sufficient. The only way on or off this island is with his permission, which you have to earn.
Lloyd::: You never told me about this place. How do you know so much about this island?
Garmadon::: Because before Chen was my enemy, he was my Sensei. 
Lloyd::: You never told me you had a Sensei.
Garmadon::: When I was your age, I sought a darker means of guidance. He taught me to win at all cost, no matter who I hurt. It wasn't until you saved me that I saw the light.
Jay::: Uh, apparently he also never taught you to have a sense of humor. Lighten up, we're in an underground fight club. This is supposed to be fun.
Clouse::: All rise for Master Chen.
Chen::: Welcome to the Tournament of Elements. Now everyone can all di——rect your attention to me! 
Garmadon:::I forgot to mention he has a penchant for theatrics.
Chen:::Never before have so many Elemental Fighters been under one roof. I see Master of Fire, Green Savior. And a former pupil has returned.This symbol before you is for the Anacondrai, fiercest Serpentine warrior to ever roam this land. Its creed: "Only one can remain."
Kai::: Good, looks like we're each in our own bracket. We won't have to face each other for a while.
Lloyd::: Better find Zane before that happens.
Chen::: Behold, a Jadeblade. Here, it represents life. Obtain it, move on. Allow your opponent to take it, loser. The rules are simple. Every match will be different. No two fights will be the same. Your powers will keep you in the Tournament. Use it or lose it.
Karlof::: Hm, what does Karlof win?
Chen::: Win and stay on the island. Win it all, and you'll receive fortunes beyond your wildest dreams, and lifetime supply of Master Chen noodles. But no one is here because of noodle. You want the glory of being the greatest fighter in all of Ninjago! 
Garmadon::: And what happens if they lose?
Chen::: Lose? Who here likes to lose?Now please, enjoy my island. It's a super fun happy place. Hahaha. Fun time on me.
Clouse::: You'll now each be shown to your rooms.
Jay::: Ah, just what this place needs. Creepy clowns.
Garmadon::: Not clowns. Kabuki, Chen's jesters.
Cole::: Yeah, well, whatever they are, I don't like them.
Kai::: So much for staying together. 
Garmadon::: Always be ready. Never lose focus.
Kai::: What? Uh, what did he say?
Jay::: I don't know. Something about, uh, mucus?
Kabuki #1::: Your Fire suite, Master Kai.
Kai::: Are you kidding me? Ha! Fire!Whoa, so handsome.i could get used to this.Huh? Ah. Looks like we're neighbors. I'm Kai, Master of Fire. 
Skylor::: Skylor, Master of...wouldn't you like to know?
Kai::: Huh? Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Skylor::: 
Kabuki #2::: Every device within your room has been configured to interact with your own electrical signal.
Jay:::Whoo! 
Cole::: A stone bed? Come on.Huh?Chen's Noodle House? Three ingredient sizzling rice, snow pea cuttlefish, mu shu wu shu? Haha!Cake? Hah! Score!
Lloyd::: Yeah, this is sweet, hehe.Don't worry. We're gonna find you, pal.
Clouse::: Since you weren't invited by Master Chen, I'm sorry to say there's no room for you.
Garmadon::: Fine, I'll just stand guard. I wouldn't want anything to happen to them. I know how you like to use Dark Magic.
Clouse::: Now, why would I want to cheat the ninja?
Chen:::Fellow fighters, hidden around my island are enough Jadebladesfor every participant except for one. The one who returns to the palace arena empty-handed loses. The tournament begins...now!
Jay:::Now?
Bolobo::: Aah! This room could use a breath of fresh air. Lightning, meet Nature!
Chen:::May the best fighter win. 
Skylor::: Is that—
Kai::: A Jadeblade?
Lloyd:::Hey.Huh?
Skylor::: That one is mine.
Kai::: Hey! 
Skylor::: Stop!
Kai::: You stop! Unh! 
Skylor::: Help me!Sorry, hot tamale. 
Karlof::: What does Karlof...
Cole::: Oh, I can't fight on a full stomach.All right!
Griffin:::Ha! Too slow, Rocky Boy.
Cole::: Hey!
Fritz::: Fear? Fear isn't a word where I come from.
Bolobo:::Ooh, Fritz Donnegan.
Jay:::Haha! I love my room!
Lloyd::: Wha—Hey!
Garmadon::: Hurry, Lloyd. You must not lose. 
Cole:::It's mine! Oh, stomach cramp.Hey, stop! Stupid Blade. Unh!Hahaha! Ninja, go!Okay, that was too fast.Hey, that's mine!Uh. Yes!
Clouse::: Two Jadeblades remaining.
Cole::: Wait! I got one!
Jay::: Cole! Whoo-hoo! You made it.
Cole::: Where's Kai?
Chen::: Only one Jadeblade remaining.Get on with it!
Karlof::: Hahaha! Karlof wins!What?
Kai::: Ah, looks like you got a screw loose. 
Chen::: We have a loser!
Karlof:::That's not fair. He cheated.
Kai::: I did what I had to do.
Garmadon::: That is not how you win.
Karlof::: Fine, I lose. Karlof never wanted to be on stinking island.
Chen::: Oh, I'm sorry to hear you did not enjoy your stay. I guess this worked out for the best. This is goodbye!As you can see, lose and you are out. Break any rule, you are out. Never bite the hand that feeds you Master Chen delicious noodle! Now rest up. Tomorrow the tournament will recommence.
Cole::: At least the chow's good.
Jay::: Arrgh, it's killing me. What's under the trapdoor? What happens when you lose?
Garmadon::: Don't think about that.
Jay::: It's all I can think about. I moved on. I feel guilt. These are not good feelings.
Kai::: You think you feel bad? Imaging how I feel. Our mission is simple. Tonight we find Zane and get off this crazy island.
Cole::: And just how are we supposed to do that? You heard Chen. Break a rule and we're out. He's not gonna let us roam around.
Kai::: Then it's a good thing we're ninja. Meet me in my room at midnight.
Mr. Pale::: You mind if I join you?
Jay::: Disappear, pal! This is private.I know you're still here. I can see your lunch tray.
Cole::: Wow, Jay, you were really mean.
Jay::: How am I supposed to know if we can trust him? See what this island is doing to me? It's corrupting me! It has to stop. I'll see you tonight.
Skylor::: What was that you said?
Kai::: Uh, I said w-w-what a beautiful night. Haha.
Jay:::Oh, come on.
Skylor::: What do you think happened to Karlof?
Kai::: I feel horrible. If I had known what would happen—
Skylor::: You did what you had to do to stay in the Tournament. I'm sorry if I was cold to you earlier.
Jay::: Psst.
Skylor::: Maybe it's good to have friends.
Jay::: Kai!
Kai::: Jay, would you stop making that noise?
Skylor::: You had asked about my power—
Kai::: Uh, yeah, oh, it's so cold out.Better call it a night, hehe. 
Skylor::: Oh, okay. Sorry to have bothered—
Kai:::Oh, okay. Good night. 
Jay::: You just had to leave me hanging, huh, Romeo?Whoa-ho-ho-ho. Nice digs.
Cole::: I know. His room is so much nicer than mine. Look, chocolate-covered shell peas. I love these.Oh, and look how soft your pillows are. Man, mine are made of rock. What a crock.
Jay::: Okay, it was almost impossible to get here. This place is swarming with guards. Any ideas on how we search the island?
Kai::: We travel by shadow. Cover every square inch of this place until we find him.
Cole:::Whoa—
Jay::: The island's big. We'll need to split up.
Lloyd::: No, we stick together.
Cole:::Uh, guys, this bed is, uh...
Kai::: Cole, I get it! You like my bed. Would you stop playing around?
Cole::: I think I know how we can search the island.
Lloyd::: Okay, I feel ridiculous.
Jay::: Ah, you're right. The pillows are soft.
Lloyd::: Is this a joke?
Cole::: I must've done something to trigger it. I was laying here, then I stretched—
All::: 
Jay::: Whoa! Secret passageway! Cool.
Kai:::Nice work, Cole. Maybe Zane's not on the island, but in it. 
Lloyd::: Quiet. Do you hear that?
Jay:::Oh, secret peep holes. Haha! Super cool. Sounds like someone's fighting on the other side of this wall.
Cole::: What do you see? Who's fighting?
Jay::: It's not a fight. It's Skylor's room. And it looks like she's training.
Kai:::Let me see, let me see!
Cole::: Ah, looks like Kai's got the hots for her.
Kai::: No, she's competition. I just wanna know what powers we're up against. 
Jay::: Ugh, wait your turn.
Kai::: We can at least share.
Lloyd::: Guys, this is an invasion of privacy.
Kai::: Ugh, her room doesn't reveal anything about her power. 
Cole::: What was it? What did you see?
Kai::: She's...Fire...
Lloyd::: Wait a minute, if we're all descendants of Elemental Masters...
Cole:::Kai's heart is on fire. Kai's heart is on fire. Kai's heart is on fire.
Kai::: Can we please just keep moving? It's like a maze down here. Good thing you're leaving a trail back to our room.
Cole::: I'm what?Oh, yeah, heh. I meant to do that.
Lloyd:::Everyone stop! Booby traps.
Jay::: Haha! Booby traps. Even cooler. Haha.Or, I mean, kinda cool. I mean, they're totally not cool, you know, 'cause they're dangerous.
Lloyd::: From here on out, we have to watch our step.
Kai:::Do you hear that? Everyone be quiet. 
Kai::: Stop licking your tattoos.
Cole::: It's chocolate. I can't resist.
Lloyd::: Shh! Just try to fit in. 
Chen::: Bring out the loser.
Karlof::: Unh! Get hands off Karlof! Karlof wish he never sign up for this. What's chanting for?
Chen::: Uh, they're saying "only one can remain." Like I said, use it or lose it. 
Kai::: He's stolen Karlof's power.
Cole::: And he used Ice. That means he must have already stolen Zane's power too.
Karlof::: What happened to my Metal?
Chen::: Your Metal? Oh, it's mine now.But now I will let you go.
Karlof::: Really?
Chen::: To the factory!
Karlof::: No, no! Let Karlof go! No, no!
Lloyd::: Jay, your face...
Jay:::My face? All of our faces! The chocolate's melting.
Warrior::: Who are they?
Chen::: Intruders! Stop them! They must not escape!
Kai::: A-ha! Yes!Oh, no! 
Cole::: That was close. 
Jay::: That sound. 
Kai::: That has got to be the second biggest snake I have ever seen!Are we...
Lloyd::: Yeah, barely.
Cole::: Did we just—ow!
Jay::: No more sneaking around. From now on, let's just follow the rules.
Kai::: Unh! We may not have found Zane, but we found something just as important. This tournament isn't about glory. It's about Chen stealing all of our Elemental Powers.
Lloyd::: But why? What is he planning?
Kai::: I don't know, but if we're gonna find out and find Zane, we have to play by his rules. Agreed?
All::: Agreed.
Cole::: Good thing we weren't spotted. That was close.
Jay::: Yeah, too close. 
Clouse::: Hm. Good work, my pet. Yes, yes, we do know who the impostors are, don't we? Don't worry. They will pay for their actions.
