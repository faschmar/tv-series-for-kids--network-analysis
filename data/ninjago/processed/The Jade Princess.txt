Lloyd::: He's got the Princess.You gotta be kidding me.Who are you?Oh. Princess? I thought you were kidnapped. I was trying to save you.
Harumi::: Was that what that was? From my vantage, it looked like I was the one saving you.
Lloyd::: Then who's in the bag?
Harumi::: You mean what's in the bag. Food. For the less fortunate. Even though I'm confined to the palace, I still try to give what I can.
Lloyd::: But your bedroom. It was ransacked.
Harumi::: Yes, I can be quite a slob. Thank you for noticing.
Lloyd::: I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean—
Hutchins::: The Princess is gone! Find her!
Harumi::: They can't know I left the palace.You have to disguise yourself. Hurry.Some things are easier to do when you're not a princess. If I asked my parents, they would never allow it. But these people are hungry. And we have so much food in the palace.Patience, little ones. There's enough for each of you. 
Lloyd::: Can I ask you a question? Do you enjoy being a princess?
Harumi::: Everyone thinks being a princess is supposed to be easy, and wonderful, and I guess it's okay, but a lot of the time it's really hard.
Lloyd::: Huh. Tell me about it. Not being a princess, I mean being the Green Ninja.
Harumi::: We have to live up to a role that was bestowed upon us. We never chose these mantles we hold.
Lloyd::: I know. It's hard to live a normal life. At least I get to wear a mask, but you—
Harumi::: I wear my own masks. Sometimes painted, sometimes a kidnapper of princesses! Muahaha!
Lloyd::: In my defense, it was my first day. 
Harumi::: We must leave.
Lloyd::: These people have enough to worry about; they shouldn't have to be bullied by low level street thugs.
Harumi::: Don't. If you try to stop them, you'll reveal us.What's wrong?
Lloyd::: That's the same symbol I saw before. The Sons of Garmadon. He was my father.
Harumi::: No! You said it yourself. They are only low level thugs. They don't know anything. They only take orders. It's the person who gives them that scares me.
Lloyd::: I have to do something. 
Harumi::: Or you could let Samurai X take care of it.
Samurai X::: Step away from the pedestrians.
Chopper Maroon::: Samurai X? Let's split! 
Lloyd::: It's good to know the ninja aren't the only ones protecting Ninjago.
Samurai X::: Remember, kids, look out for one another. And stay safe. 
Harumi::: Who is Samurai X?
Lloyd::: I wish I knew. Princess—
Harumi::: Please, call me Rumi.
Lloyd::: Rumi, I should get you home.
Hutchins::: Yes. You should be home, your Highness.
Harumi:::Hutchins!
Hutchins::: May I ask what you are doing outside the palace?
Lloyd::: Rumi and I were just going for a walk.
Hutchins::: Rumi? A walk?
Harumi::: It was my idea. Please don't be angry with Lloyd.
Hutchins::: It's troubling to see you two are on a first name basis. The streets are not safe at night, your Highness. I must insist you return with me, at once.
Cole::: Moonlit walks on the canal, sharing food—Ah! Sounds a lot like a date. Ah!
Lloyd::: It was not a date.
Zane::: A date: a social or romantic engagement. Often involving a meal or an intimate setting.
Kai::: Look, if you like this girl, you're gonna have to step up your game.
Lloyd::: What do you mean "game?"
Zane::: It means one's ability to charm. You need to convince her why you are the most logical mate.
Cole::: If you want to impress her, you gotta act tough. Like, flex your muscles and stuff. Break things.Phew.
Jay::: Pfft. No way. You gotta make her laugh. Just ask Nya. She couldn't resist my sense of humor.
Nya::: It's an acquired taste.
Kai::: Don't listen to them. You gotta act cool. Like you don't even care.
Lloyd::: But I do.
Jay::: A-ha! So you admit it.
Nya::: Okay, stop. All of you are really not helping him. Look, just be yourself. It's so much easier than trying to be someone you're not.
Cole:::Haha, got ya!
Emperor::: What were you thinking, Harumi?
Empress::: You are a member of the Royal Family of Ninjago.
Emperor::: You can't just go gallivanting off with a ninja whenever you want. It's undignified.
Empress::: Not to mention dangerous.
Harumi::: But he's not just a ninja—
Emperor::: You are royalty. He is not.
Harumi::: I'm sorry. I have dishonored our name and our house.
Emperor::: No, Harumi. We're sorry. We all have a role to play. And yours is in this palace. Your heart mustn't interfere. 
Lloyd::: Rumi…
Hutchins::: If you know what's good for you, stay away from her.
Nya::: What happened?
Lloyd::: I can be myself, but not everyone can be so lucky.
Mohawk::: Hey, is that her?
S.O.G.::: Who else could it be?
Mohawk::: I hear she's crazy.
S.O.G.::: Don't ever let her hear you say that. If she hears you call her crazy, she'll go crazy.
Mohawk::: Then stop saying it.
Ultra Violet::: Shh.
Mohawk::: I heard she jumped out of a ten-story building just 'cause she didn't want to take the stairs.
S.O.G.::: I heard she dragged a guy on her bike for two miles, just 'cause he was looking at it the wrong way.
Ultra Violet:::If you two don't be quiet, I have ways of shutting you up.
S.O.G.::: Eh, sorry, Miss Violet, but Mr. E requested we get you.
Mohawk::: Yeah, yes. Something big's going down and—
Ultra Violet::: Oh. Is there gonna be a fight?
S.O.G.::: Oh, yeah, Miss Violet. And maybe an explosion or two.
Ultra Violet::: It's not Miss Violet. It's Ultra Violet!
Royal Guard::: Hey! Stop right there!
Postman::: Hey, hey. I'm just trying to deliver mail.
Kai::: It's okay, guys. I know him. Sorry, nobody goes into the palace. I can deliver it to them.
Postman::: Uh, thanks. See you next season!
Kai::: Season?
Postman::: You know, fall, spring, summer, whatever.
Past Wu::: Hello there.
Past Cole::: How did you—Who are you?
Past Wu::: Maybe that is a question for me to ask. But first, why do you climb the mountain?
Past Cole::: I… just lost… someone. My father should be sad, or angry, but he's just, he's—
Past Wu::: Yes?
Past Cole::: He spends all his time with this group singing and dancing. He's never home, leaving all the chores for me. With her gone, I guess it's up to me to be the responsible one. He acts like nothing's happened. How can he sing and dance at a time like this?
Past Wu:::Grief takes many shapes and forms. Some sing and dance, some climb mountains.
Cole::: Why did you climb the mountain?
Past Wu::: To find you, Cole. 
Cole::: And I'll find you, Master.Blast Sap. Guys, we've got a big problem. Blast Sap—There's Blast Sap—I saw a—
Lloyd::: Cole, you're not coming in. You have a bad signal. 
Cole::: We gotta get everyone out of here. The whole palace is rigged to explode. It was Hutchins!
Kai::: We have to get the Royal Family out of here! 
Ultra Violet::: What a beautiful night for a little mayhem. Hahaha!
Kai::: I didn't even get your—name.
Nya::: Let's leave the boys out of this. Hm? 
Lloyd::: You did this! You helped them!
Hutchins::: I had nothing to do with this.
Lloyd::: Cole said he saw you in the tunnels. With the explosives!
Hutchins::: Whatever your friend saw, it wasn't me. I have served this house for the better part of my life, and have sworn to protect the Royal Family. Watch out! 
Lloyd::: You saved me.
Hutchins::: Does anyone have eyes on the Princess?
Zane::: Come with me, Princess. We need to get you out of here. 
Lloyd::: You're okay.
Harumi::: But what about the mask? 
Jay::: Whoever you are, you should have brought more help.
Kai::: Hands in the air.
Jay:::The Oni Mask of Vengeance!Really? Four arms? Pfft. Like that's new.
Kai::: Ugh.
Jay::: Can't any one of us stop him? 
Nya::: Uh, I think my brother just destroyed the Mask of Deception.
Lloyd::: What?
Hutchins::: That one was a fake. I procured the real one from the vaults below. 
Harumi::: A fake?
Hutchins::: Forgive me, your Highness, it is the Mask if Deception. I wasn't sure if I could trust the ninja. But I do now.Take it. And get the Princess out of here!
Harumi::: But what about my parents?
Hutchins::: I'll find them. 
Lloyd::: I was wrong about you. 
Hutchins::: Go!
Lloyd:::Get on!
Harumi::: They're right behind us!
Lloyd::: Hold on. 
Ultra Violet::: No!
Lloyd::: Ha! Lost 'em.Her again? Keep your head down. 
Ultra Violet::: Oh, yeah!
Harumi::: We have to get it. 
Lloyd::: We have to get out of here.
Harumi::: It's a dead end!
Lloyd::: But we're not dead yet! This way, Princess. 
Ultra Violet::: Bad call. Can't hide from me, ninja.
Harumi::: What are you thinking? We can't get away from them in this thing.
Lloyd::: Hey, now. This "thing" still has a few surprises in her.
Harumi::: Lloyd! They're not gonna just let us sail away.
Lloyd::: Who said anything about sail? 
Ultra Violet::: No!
Harumi::: Whoa. I've never seen the city from this high before.
Lloyd::: Your highness, welcome aboard the Destiny's Bounty.
Harumi::: The Emperor and Empress? Where is Hutchins? Did they—
Nya::: I'm sorry, Princess. They didn't make it.
Kai::: What about the mask?I promise you, we'll find the people responsible for this.
Harumi::: Once again, I am alone.
Lloyd::: You're with us now. And we'll make sure to find out who is behind all this. They are not going to get away.
