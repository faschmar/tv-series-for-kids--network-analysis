Munce::: Not good! Not good idea at all!
Munce::: Is bad idea!
Munce::: Truce meeting with Geckles is trap! Tricky Geckle trap!
Jay::: Guys, it's not a trap! The Geckles aren't your enemies!
Nya::: It's no use, they're not listening.
Murtessa::: You must make them listen.
Nya::: Oh, it's you.
Jay::: Nya. Be nice.
Nya::: She attacked me with a giant spiked club, Jay. Remember?
Jay::: Yeah, but if you hold every little thing against a person, you won't make any friends at all.
Nya:::Make them listen how?
Murtessa::: Munce are proud. Strong. They respect only power.
Nya::: Hmm.Alright, you Munce. Listen up! We are going to that truce meeting, and there will be peace! If I have to fight every last one of you! Is that clear?Good. Now, let's get this show on the road.
Groko::: This meeting is a trap! A treacherous Munce ambush!
Garpo::: Hear, hear!
Ginkle::: I propose we ambush them!
Kai::: Order! Order in the court.
Zane::: I do not believe they're listening.
Kai::: Ugh.Thank you. Now, I propose that we trust the new Munce Queen, whoever she is, and go to the truce meeting.
Zane:::Hear, hear.I am attempting to follow Geckle Parliamentary procedures.
Groko::: What if you're wrong?
Ginkle::: Yeah, how do you know?
Kai::: How do you settle a matter by slug?
Gulch::: On your mark, get set... slow!
Geckle::: Oh, Brown! You can do it!
Garpo::: Go go go! Brown for the win!
Zane::: What is the purpose of this?
Gulch::: It's simple. If the gray slug wins, you're right, and the Munce can be trusted. If the brown slug wins, you're wrong, and the Munce cannot be trusted. Only the slugs know.
Kai::: Okay, uh, Gleck, don't take this the wrong way, but you're the little purple creature palace, aren't you?
Gleck::: Yes. I did not mean to scare him. I was looking for Gilly. I heard that the Elemental Master of Earth was invited to Shintaro. But I was wrong.
Zane::: Gleck, may I see your necklace?
Gleck::: Will you give it back? It is my most prized possession! Given to me by Gilly, herself!
Zane::: Of course, I promise. 
Kai::: Hey! Those are Cole's parents, Lou, and - and - ugh, what's his mom's name again?
Zane::: Lilly.
Kai and Zane:::Lilly is Gilly!
Gleck::: You - you know her? Oh, joyous news! Will you tell her the Geckles need her help again? Please?
Kai::: Ah, Gleck, I'm not sure how to say this, but... the woman you called Gilly... passed away a while ago.I'm sorry.
Vangelis::: What? Who is to blame for this?
Hazza D'ur::: The the Pit, to a tomb guarded by Re-Awakened.) Wake up, spawn.
Skull Sorcerer::: Open it!Bring the bones back to life, Hazza D'ur! Bring back Grief-Bringer!
Hazza D'ur::: Rise. Rise! 
Gleck::: Oh no! The Brown Slug is winning. That means the Munce cannot be trusted.
Kai::: We have to do something, Zane. Use your powers. Make an ice-slick for the grey slug!
Zane::: That would be cheating.
Kai::: It's not cheating, Zane, it's a white lie.
Zane::: A white lie?
Kai::: Yeah, it means we're doing it for a good reason. To stop a war, to defeat the Skull Sorcerer.Oh, no.
Zane::: You are implying that a lie can be good if done for a good reason? I do not accept that supposition.
Kai::: Ugh. Zane, what about the time you impersonated Clutch Powers to get into the Explorer's Club?
Zane::: Clutch Powers was hospitalized and unable to go himself. It was necessary.
Kai::: Right! We did it because we had to. Because there was no other way! Argh, we're running out of time. Ugh. It's over. It's all over.
Zane::: Very well. I accept the necessity of a white lie. 
Kai::: Wow! Wow, wow, wow. What a race! Well, the slugs have decided. Meeting's on.
Zane::: I do not see the necessity of this armor.
Gulch::: Merely a precaution. Just in case it is an ambush. The slugs are never wrong, but I suppose there's always a first.
Kai::: What do you know about this new Munce Queen? What's she like?
Gulch::: I have no idea. Except the Munce consider her very fierce and very ... ugly.
Kai::: Ugh.
Nya::: Is it really necessary for them to carry me?
Murt::: You are queen of the Munce. Very important position. Yes, it is necessary.
Lloyd::: Hang in there, Nya. Just a little further.
Nya::: Kai!?
Kai::: Nya? 
Lloyd::: Guys!
Jay::: Boy, are we glad to see you!
Zane::: Lloyd!
Geckle::: Protect the Chancellor!
Munce::: Protect the Queen!
Kai::: Whoa, whoa. Easy, guys. Stand down!
Nya::: Yeah, relax, it's okay!
Gulch::: You know the Munce Queen?
Kai::: Yeah, it's my sister. And she's not that ugly.
Nya::: Excuse me?
Kai::: Uh, long story. Gulch, Gleck, relax, guys. Nothing's gonna happen. Okay? 
Gulch::: That sound...
Murtessa::: No! It is not possible!
Nya::: What? What is it?
Gulch and Murtessa::: Grief-Bringer!
Nya::: Run! 
Gleck::: This way!
Lloyd:::Get them to safety!
Nya::: What about you?
Lloyd::: We're gonna try to slow it down! Come on, Zane!
Zane:::I - I can't hold it!
Nya:::Oh no!
Kai::: Oh, what do we do now?
Gleck::: It's easy! Like this! 
Kai::: Well, if Jay can do it, how hard can it be?Help!
Nya::: Grab my hand!
Zane::: Lloyd! I cannot hold it much longer!
Lloyd::: On three, let it go! Trust me! On three! One, two, three! 
Zane::: Lloyd!We must run!
Nya::: Come on! Swing across!
Skull Sorcerer::: Look at them, fleeing like rats. But they cannot escape.
Hazza D'ur::: Grief will come to you all!
