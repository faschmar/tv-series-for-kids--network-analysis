Cole::: Yeah! Alright!
Jay::: I still can't believe you found a Traveler's Tree, Cole. 
Cole::: Me neither. Who would've thought Traveler's Tea comes from a tree, right?
Nya::: I wonder how we turn it into tea.
Jay::: Maybe that old lady in the village can help! She probably knows a lot of weird stuff.
Nya::: Sorla? Yeah, hopefully.
Cole::: All I know is I am not losing these leaves again. I'm keeping them tucked right here, safe and—What's up, Krag? What do you smell?
Jay:::What was that? 
Nya::: A dragon!
Cole::: Looks like it's heading for the village! .
Uthaug::: Uh. You're doing it wrong! Let me try. 
Boma::: The ice is just too thick!
Uthaug:::Too thick for you, maybe, but I'm stronger.
Boma::: Ugh, everyone knows I'm the strong one, Uthaug, if I can't do it, you don't have a chance.
Uthaug::: What are you talking about? Look at my muscles, I don't even want to flex. I like these clothes! 
Child #1::: Kai, Kai! Light our fish!
Kai::: Okay, okay, one at a time! 
Child #2::: What was that?
Kai::: Get inside, all of you.Run!You can do it, you can do it! Come on, Kai, come on! Come on, come on! Come on!Oh, no! 
Sorla::: Run!
Kai:::Sorla! No. No, no, no.Here, over here!Whoa-ahh!Unh.No. Anyone? Is anyone there? 
Nya::: Oh, no!
Jay::: Kai!
Cole::: Are you alright?
Kai::: I couldn't do anything... to stop it. I-I tried, but...my Elemental Powers weren't strong enough. I... I-I couldn't stop it.
Nya:::Sorla! 
Jay::: Nya, you can't help her.
Nya::: We have to! We have to find a way!
Cole::: Nya, he's right.
Kai::: I was supposed to protect them. And I failed. 
Jay::: They're not dead, Kai. They're frozen. We'll find a way to help them. I promise.
Nya::: How?
Cole::: The Ice Emperor. He did this.
Kai::: Then maybe it's time we took the fight to him.
Nya::: What do you have in mind?
Kai::: Lloyd wanted us to distract the Ice Emperor. To give him a chance to sneak in and find Zane. What better way to distract him than to find the Land Bounty, fix it up, and drive it through his front door?
Cole::: You know, when I suggest things like that, everyone thinks I'm bonkers. But I like it.
Nya::: Me too.
Jay::: Let's do it. 
Kai:::Ahh!
Lloyd::: There it is.
Akita:::What are we waiting for?
Lloyd::: It's gonna be dark soon. We'll have a better chance of crossing the glacier by daylight. 
Akita::: When you have rescued your friend Zane, what will you do?
Lloyd::: Go back to Ninjago, if there's a way. What about you?
Akita::: I do not know. The forest is my home.
Lloyd::: Maybe you can come with us!
Akita::: Do you have Formlings in Ninjago?
Lloyd::: No.
Akita::: Then I would be alone there, too.
Lloyd::: You wouldn't be alone! You'd be with us! We have a really cool Monastery, video games, a hot tub, uh, there's just these chickens you have to watch out for.What is it?
Akita::: Something is coming. 
Lloyd:::Gah! Akita, get behind me!No!Come on, come on!No! Not good, not good!
Automated Response::: Warning: Hull integrity at 40%. 
Lloyd::: Ahh!
Automated Response::: 30%.20%. Warning, warning. Hull integrity: 10%.
Lloyd::: I can count down to my own impending doom, thank you!Akita!Unh. Eh.
Vex::: No, bring him to the Ice Emperor. (Boreal grabs Lloyd and heads toward the Ice Castle. Akita transforms back into her human form and watches helplessly.
Lloyd:::Eh. Unh. 
Vex::: Pick him up.My Emperor, behold, the stranger in green. 
Lloyd:::Zane?
