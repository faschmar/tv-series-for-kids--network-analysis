Past Lloyd::: Lookout! 
Past Nya:::Zane!Oh, no! Zane!
Past Cole::: Zane!
P.I.X.A.L.:::Zane!Nooo! 
Nya:::P.I.X.A.L.! Are you okay?
P.I.X.A.L.::: I am fine. I was dreaming about the moment he... he...
Nya:::It's okay, I know.
P.I.X.A.L.:::I... find it difficult to accept that he is gone.
Lloyd::: Me too. 
Jay::: We all do. It just doesn't feel real. 
Wu:::Zane's alive!
Lloyd::: What?!
Kai:::Where?!
Jay:::How?!
Wu::: Quiet. All of you. Listen! I spoke to Aspheera at Kryptarium Prison. She didn't destroy Zane. She banished him to a distant realm.
Kai::: Well, what are we waiting for?! We gotta go after him!
Lloyd::: Yeah!What realm?
Wu::: The Never-Realm.
Kai::: Huh?
Lloyd::: What?
Nya::: The Never-Realm?
Cole::: I've never heard of it.
Wu::: There are few who have. 
Lloyd::: Wait! What's the Never-Realm?
Wu::: According to legend, it is the most distant and remote of all realms. My father only spoke of it to me once...in warning.He told me of all the realms of Creation, it was the one I should never visit. He told me it was a cold and dangerous place. He forbade it.
Jay::: Uh, "forbade" as in absolutely never, ever?
Kai::: Why?
Cole::: Yeah. What's wrong with it?
Wu::: I don't know. He went there only once and said he nearly couldn't find his way home. He said it was unlike the other realms. He warned me that others would not be as fortunate.
Jay::: Well that's just great. Creepy and vague.
Wu::: I will use Aspheera's staff to find Zane. It banished him there. It will work for me too.Once I have found him, I will use the Traveler's Tea to bring us both home.
Lloyd::: You mean all seven of us because we're going with you!
Cole::: Yeah!
Wu::: Absolutely not. I cannot allow it. What happened to him is my fault and mine alone. It is my responsibility.
Kai::: Hey, no way!
Cole::: We're not sitting this one out!
Jay::: Zane's our brother!
Wu::: Enough!I will risk no other lives! My foolishness has already caused enough damage.My decision is final.
Lloyd:::Okay. We understand, Master. But.. this feels a little rushed. Maybe you should just, you know, sleep on it. For a night. And come up with a game plan.
Wu:::A game plan?
Lloyd::: Yeah, you know, prepare. Think it all out.
Jay::: Um. Yeah, yeah. Exactly! You're the one always telling us not to rush into stuff. Right?
Wu:::Very well. I will meditate on it.
Cole, Nya, and Kai::: Ugh.
Chicken::: 
Wu::: 
Cole::: Did you get it this time?
Lloyd:::Got it.
Cole::: Great. We have our return ticket. I wonder why Wu was so adamant about going alone. Sure, the Never-Realm sounds creepy, but how bad could it be?
Lloyd::: Beats me. Come on. Let's get the staff.
Nya:::What about the tracking device?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Right here. 
Nya::: What's it key to?
P.I.X.A.L::: The mech. Assuming Zane is still with it and it's within a 500-mile radius, you will see it on this display.
Jay::: Master Wu's going to be pretty upset if he wakes up and finds us gone.
Lloyd::: But he is upset.He's not thinking rationally.
Cole::: Yeah. He'll understand.
Jay:::Gah!
Kai::: Master Wu!
Lloyd::: How'd you get down here? Y-you were just upstairs.
Wu::: Give me the Traveler's Tea, Lloyd.
Lloyd::: I can't do that. It's for your own good, master.
Wu::: That is for me to judge. Give me the Traveler's Tea.
Lloyd::: We stand a better chance at finding Zane and you know it. There are more of us, and we're younger, and stronger and—
Wu::: GIVE ME THE TEA!
Lloyd::: You're holding the Forbidden Scroll, master. Why don't you put it down?
Wu::: You disobey me?!
Lloyd::: I'm sorry, but...yes.
Wu::: Yah!Give it to me, Nya.
Nya::: No, Master Wu! 
Wu::: The tea is not the answer! 
Lloyd::: Master, please! 
Jay::: Yeah, come on. Let's not fight about this. 
Cole::: Yeah, Wu... try to understand. 
Lloyd:::Gah!Ahh!
Nya::: Lloyd!
Lloyd::: It's the scroll, Master Wu! Don't you see what it—
Wu::: I will not risk anyone else's life! Now do as I command, and give me the Traveler's Tea!
Lloyd::: Master, I'm really sorry about this, but you're not giving us any choice.Get him! 
Wu:::Unh. Oh. The tea. The tea will not r— 
Jay::: Oh boy!
Kai::: Did we just tie up our own master?
Cole::: At least we know we're back in shape. Last time was just embarrassing.
Lloyd::: We didn't have a choice. I'm sorry, Master Wu, but you're not thinking very clearly. Just like you were before Zane disappeared, and that's just making it worse.P.I.X., I need you to do the honors. Everyone else, on the Bounty.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Please hurry. I do not wish to hold this any longer than necessary. It feels... strange. 
Lloyd::: I'm really sorry about this, Master Wu. I hope one day you can forgive me.
Wu:::Don't do this. Don't do this! Don't do this.
Lloyd::: We'll be back with Zane. I promise. 
Cole::: Lock and load!
Nya::: P.I.X.A.L., do you copy?
P.I.X.A.L.::: I read you. Are you ready?
Lloyd::: Anyone having second thoughts? It's now or never.
Jay::: Next stop, the Never-Realm.
Cole::: What are we waiting for?
Kai::: Let's get the show on the road.
Nya::: We're ready.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Here we go. 
Past Lloyd:::Look out!
P.I.X.A.L.::: 
Wu:::No! Please... 
Ninja:::Ahh!
Jay::: What's-what's happening?!
Kai::: Whoa, whoa.Whaaa!
Lloyd::: Hold on, everyone!
Ninja:::Ahh!
P.I.X.A.L.:::I know you are angry, Master.But logically, Lloyd was correct. Their chances together outweigh your chances alone. They will return to us. They have the Traveler's Tea.
Wu::: That was what I was trying to warn you about. Traveler's Tea grown in Ninjago won't work in the Never-Realm. I lied so that I could go alone. Now they are lost there, just like Zane.It's called the Never-Realm because they may never return.
P.I.X.A.L.:::
