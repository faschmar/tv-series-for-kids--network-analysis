Lloyd::: And they call themselves the "Sons of Garmadon." And they had this creepy symbol that looked like my father. As soon as I saw it, I knew it. Here we go again.I just have the worst luck. There was this girl named destroy us.Just my life.Those don't look good. What do you say we pick up the pace? 
Grimfax::: Hail, Emperor of Ice.The Legion of Grimfax returns in triumph. Victory is yours.
Grimfax::: It is true. The battle was fierce. The villagers have protectors. Strangers who fight bravely, but we won in the end!
Vex::: Did you slay the strangers?
Grimfax::: Better, we snuffed out their fire! Without it, they are lost.
Vex::: Ah, "snuffed out their fire," you say? Then, why is it, when I look through my crystal, I see it is still burning? 
Grimfax::: What?! I-Impossible!
Vex::: You bring news of defeat and dare to call it victory?! Punish him, my Lord, for his deceit.
Grimfax::: Wait! Please!
Vex::: Yes. Punish him.
Ice Emperor::: You will atone for this. 
Grimfax::: Y-Yes, Ice Emperor. Thank you.
Ice Emperor::: Now leave me. 
Vex::: What of the villagers who defy you? They plot, even now, to overthrow you. And the stranger in green. He grows closer every day. What of him?
Ice Emperor::: Green?
Vex::: You are plagued by enemies. They rise. You must show strength. You must put down these usurpers.
Ice Emperor::: I shall unleash Boreal! Boreal shall punish the village.
Vex::: And the stranger?
Ice Emperor::: He will meet another fate. 
Lloyd::: So then, there's this huge stone Colossus, and I'm thinking, "What am I supposed to do? There's no Spinjitzu move for this."And, I mean we all came together and took it down, but, oh boy, it wasn't easy. Wait.What is that? This doesn't look like normal ice.Yeah, maybe not a good idea. Wow. There's more of it. It's everywhere. We better keep moving. We're going to have to find shelter if this thing gets any worse.Ice is definitely not supposed to do that.Do you hear that?
Lloyd::: Oh, no!Ahh!
Lloyd::: Come on, come on!
Lloyd::: Hey! Get away from him! Pick on someone your own size! Actually, you're bigger. But you know what I mean!How many times do I have to defeat you, before you start to feel it?
Lloyd::: Red!Red? Red, are you okay, boy? You're alive! Just hang on, buddy. I'll get you warm.Now, you just rest. You're going to be okay. We're going to be just fine. I'll take care of you.
Lloyd::: Ahh! Who are you?! Where's Red?That's the bandage I put on Red. You're Red? You're a wolf? I mean, a girl?
Red::: I-I can explain.
Lloyd::: I'd like to see you try!
Red::: I am Akita, a Formling.
Lloyd::: A shapeshifter? All this time, you were tricking me? You just let me tell you all those things? Let me go on and on, thinking you were just a wolf?
Akita::: I did not know if you could be trusted.
Lloyd::: You didn't know if I could be trusted? Haha. That's rich, considering you're the one who can't be trusted!
Akita::: I meant no harm.
Lloyd::: Well, too late! Harm done! I can't believe all the things I told you, about my father, and...and Harumi, andâ€”
Akita::: I never asked for your life story! It is not my fault you talk so much. Like, so much!
Lloyd::: So much? At least, I'm honest! I don't pretend to be something else!
Akita::: Are you calling me a liar?
Lloyd::: Maybe I am!
Akita::: Take it back.
Lloyd::: No.
Akita::: I saved your life! You should be grateful!
Lloyd::: And I saved yours! So we're even! Now stay away from me!I only travel with people I trust.
Akita::: Fine! You too! Stay away from me!
Lloyd::: Fine!Hey, what are you doing? I told you not to follow me!
Akita:::I am not yours to command! I go the way I wish to go! And that is this way!
Lloyd::: That's the way I'm going. Why are you going this way?
Akita::: I am going to face the Ice Emperor.
Lloyd::: Well, that's where I'm going! To free my friend, Zane, from the Ice Emperor.
Akita::: How? By boring him to death with stories about Harumi?
Lloyd:::Oh, what are you going to do? Fetch his slippers?
Akita::: You know I can turn back into a wolf anytime, right? And bite you?
Lloyd::: Maybe you'll get lucky and he's allergic to pets.
Akita::: Leave me alone! 
Lloyd::: You leave me alone!You shouldn't run on that. You're still hurt. 
Akita::: I am sorry I deceived you.
Lloyd::: I'm sorry, too.
Akita::: You told me everything about yourself and I... told you nothing. I will share my tale with you, if you will still hear it.
