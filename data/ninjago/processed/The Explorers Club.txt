Aspheera::: Again! 
Char::: Yes, my queen!
Aspheera:::MORE!
Cole::: Wow! She looks really angry.
Wu::: She is more powerful than I remember. Those doors will not hold for much longer.
Cole::: Guys? How's it coming?
Kai::: Give it another try, Jay.Aah!It's okay. We can do this. I hope.
Wu::: We need the second Scroll of Forbidden Spinjitzu. That is our only chance now.
Cole::: Don't worry, if it's at the the others will find it.
Shippelton::: Here I am, entering the Lost Tomb of Impending Peril.
Smythe::: Jolly good, old boy!
Shippelton::: Ah. And this is your humble narrator crossing the Great Chasm of Discontent.
Underhill::: By jove, quite so!
Shippelton::: At this point, I'm fleeing the Boobytraps of Inescapability.
Smythe::: Gadzooks! How ever did you escape?
Shippelton::: I didn't. They were inescapable. 
Underhill::: Perhaps you should have that looked at, old bean.
Shippelton::: I do say, rather noisy contraption, Wart!
Lloyd::: This is an emergency! We need one of the items in your collection!
Zane::: The second Scroll of Forbidden Spinjitzu!
Nya::: The one Clutch Powers gave you!
Cecil::: Let us see. Scroll of Confusion, Scroll of Dancing Monkeys, ah here: Scroll of Forbidden Spinjitzu. Yes, that particular artifact has indeed been deposited in our archive.
Lloyd::: Great, we need it, fast.
Cecil::: Of course, sir. I just need to see your membership card.
Lloyd::: No, we're not members, we just—.
Cecil::: It pains me deeply to inform you that access to the club archives is for members only.
Zane::: This is an emergency! The fate of all of Ninjago is at stake!
Cecil::: Oh, is it? Oh dear.
Nya::: So, we can have the scroll?
Cecil::: Oh my, no! Rules are rules, after all! Where would society be without them? Hmm? We can't have anarchy, can we?
Lloyd::: Well, um... Can we join the club then?
Cecil::: Hm. Of course. Once you reach 10,000 hours of certified exploration, notify us, and we shall begin the multi-year process of examining your applications.
Smythe::: Keeping out the riff raff, eh, Cecil?
Cecil::: No one has a sense of decorum these days, major.
Lloyd::: Did that just happen?
Nya::: Oh, that makes me mad! I'm going right back in there and giving that little pencil pusher a piece of my mind!
Zane::: We do not have time for this. May I suggest another tactic?
Nya::: What tactic?
"Clutch Powers"::: Deception.
Lloyd::: Hey, that's pretty good. You look just like Clutch.
Nya::: Oh.
"Clutch Powers"::: Hello. It is I, Clutch Powers. As you can see, I am here again, as I have been before.
Cecil:::Hello, Doctor Powers.
"Clutch Powers"::: Since there is nothing suspicious about me being here, I will enter.
Cecil::: I'm afraid, Doctor, that there is the minor matter of your membership having been suspended.
"Clutch Powers"::: Suspended?Clutch did not mention that when I spoke to him, I mean, when I spoke to me.
Cecil::: Yes, well, rules are rules, I'm afraid!
Lloyd::: What happened?
Zane::: Apparently, Clutch Powers' membership has been suspended.
Nya::: That's it! I'm done with that pencil pusher! You know what time it is? It's ninja o'clock!
Lloyd::: Okay, that looks safe......enough. 
Lloyd::: We go stealth here. No weapons.
Lloyd::: Guys, problem. 
Underhill::: Reminds me of the fall months I spent—
Smythe::: Oh, dear.
Underhill::: WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?
Nya::: Uh, sorry, we're, umm...
Lloyd::: Working on the air conditioning?
Smythe::: Security!
Cecil:::You again!
Lloyd::: Run!
Zane::: What a mess.
Lloyd::: This must be where they store all the ancient relics!
Nya::: Which means the Scroll of Forbidden Spinjitzu must be in here! Come on, spread out, let's find it.
Nya::: Lloyd, careful! That could have been dangerous.
Lloyd::: It's just some weird chest with a mouth— Whoa!
Nya::: What is that thing? It's horrible!
Zane::: It appears to be a chest vortex of the ancient Sybex Tribe!
Lloyd::: You say that like it's not weird!
Lloyd::: Yes, I'll be more careful. But don't pretend you had any idea what that thing could do, either.
Lloyd::: Agh! A mirror?
Nya::: What? What is this?
Lloyd::: It's some kind of weird mirror.
Nya:::But why?
Lloyd::: It seems to show us our greatest fears.
Nya::: How do you know?
Lloyd::: Because when I look at it, I see myself becoming my father.
Nya::: I see myself normal, like I never achieved my True Potential.
Zane::: No. I see— I see myself, but without any humanity. Only a machine.
Lloyd::: It's okay. Whatever you see, ignore it. It's not real.
Cecil::: There they are! Stop, thieves! This is getting tiresome.
Zane::: We must be in the entomology room.
Lloyd::: The what?
Zane::: Insects, from all over Ninjago.
Nya::: Come on, we don't have much time. And Lloyd, don't knock anything—
Nya::: Okay, I did that.
Zane::: Interesting. Venomasicus Tigrus, tiger wasps. Their sting's the second most painful.
Lloyd:::AAH! RUN!
Cecil::: Subdue these malefactors!
Cecil::: I will place a proper kibosh on this charade! For the empire!
Cecil::: Oh, fie!
Lloyd::: What are those?
Zane::: Vastodectrus Venemous, the number one most painful sting in the world.
Nya::: In here! We need to regroup!
Lloyd::: Sorry, guys!
Nya::: Hey, look!
Lloyd::: That's it!
Zane::: No! It's too dangerous for someone to touch with their bare hands!
Nya::: Come on, let's get back to the monastery!
Cecil::: Interlopers! Hooligans!
Smythe::: Someone will pay for this! Mark my words!
Shippelton::: I blame Clutch Powers! Somehow, this is all his fault!
Smythe::: That two-bit hack!
Shippelton::: Say, do I hear the telltale buzzing of a Vastodectrus Venemous?
