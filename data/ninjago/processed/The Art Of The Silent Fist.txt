Hover-Copter::: Sector 17 clear. Continuing search for ninja.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Initializing power transference. Extracting Golden Power. Standby for physical somatic download.
Overlord::: Yes. Yes! It's not enough! I need more of the boy's power if I'm ever to be freed of this digital prison! I'm fed up with pathetic mortal bodies. I want my own back. Find me more power! Find me the Golden Ninja!
P.I.X.A.L.::: By my computation, your primary duty should be finding the Techno Blades. They are the only things that can—
Overlord::: Those ninja don't even know what they already possess. I want the Golden one.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Nindroids have no current visual on him.
Overlord::: They just don't know where to look. 
Wu::: I'll never tell you where they're hiding.
Overlord::: You might not but your memories will. 
Wu:::It tickles.
Overlord::: It's only a matter of time until your mind tells me everything.
Wu::: Never. 
Lloyd::: Aah. This is a perfect place to lay low. No robots, no cameras, no problems.
Lloyd:::Yeah, this is sweet.
Misako::: Lloyd?
Lloyd::: Mom?
Misako::: Oh. What are you all doing here?
Lloyd::: The Overlord's back and New Ninjago City has fallen under his control. He has Sensei Wu.
Misako::: Wu's tough. There's a reason he's lived as long as he has.
Lloyd::: Well, where's Dad?
Misako::: He no longer goes by Lord. Here, he is Sensei Garmadon and he won't be back until this evening's lesson.
Jay::: Uh, did you just say Sensei Garmadon?
Zane::: I'm glad he's on our side now. With Sensei Wu gone, we could use the help.
Misako::: Come in, but your weapons are not allowed. Ever since Lloyd saved his father, Garmadon sworn an oath to never fight in hope to make up for his evil past. It's an oath he takes very seriously.
Kai::: But we were supposed to protect these with our lives.
Jay::: And never let them out of our sight.
Zane::: You guys go on ahead, I will stay back and watch over them. 
Cole::: Haha, yeah!
Kai::: Thanks, Zane.
Jay::: You're awesome.
Cole::: You're the best.
Jay::: See ya.
Girl::: Pass the ball to me. Yeah. 
Cole::: Ah, at least there's some places left in this world I'm still considered cool. 
Boy #1::: Oh, wow!
Boy #2::: It's the Green Ninja.
Jay::: Nope, still totally lame.Hey, hey!
Misako:::I recognize that look.
Nya::: What look? I wasn't looking.
Misako::: Two boys, one heart.
Nya::: Am I that obvious? What do I do? Jay's the only one who makes me laugh, but Cole...Cole's not Jay.
Garmadon::: Ah, my son. So glad you could join us.
Lloyd::: Hey, it's been a while, Father.
Jay:::Check out the new Sensei. Looking sharp.
Garmadon::: Silence! 
Jay::: Ow!
Garmadon::: Close your mouth and open your ears. Tonight's lesson is the Art of the Silent Fist. To fight without fighting. May I have a volunteer?
Lloyd::: How about me?
Nya::: The Ultimate Battle: Round Two!
Garmadon::: Attack me. But please, no powers. I happen to like my monastery.You see, the key is balance. Let your opponent fight himself.Let the enemy tire himself.
Lloyd::: Argh!Huh? 
Ninja::: Oh!
Garmadon::: Pupils, I give you the most powerful ninja in all the land, the Golden Ninja. 
Jay::: Ugh, Lloyd. 
Garmadon::: Easy, son. It is only a lesson.
Lloyd:::Sorry, I don't know what got into me.
Garmadon::: You let the anger take over. I know that feeling well. Now, let's divide into groups. 
Jay::: Ow!
Garmadon::: Perfect.
Zane::: What? P.I.X.A.L.? What are you doing?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Discontinuing an old droid. 
Zane::: You may call me old, but not slow. 
Kai::: The Techno Blades! 
Cole::: It's P.I.X.A.L.. But how did she find us?
Kai::: How about we take her apart to find out?
Zane::: Please, she was only doing what she was programmed to do. She may hold many answers, but perhaps there is an easier way. 
Garmadon::: No. I—
Jay::: Ah, relax. Ain't a weapon, only hacks into things.
P.I.X.A.L.:::Where am I? Why am I tied up?
Zane::: You were under the control of the Overlord. How did you find us?
P.I.X.A.L.::: They've mined Sensei Wu's memory. The Overlord knows all of your hiding places.
Garmadon::: My brother. Is he...is he okay?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Yes, but the Overlord wants your son. His Golden Power is the only way he can escape the digital realm and become real.
Kai::: Why did Borg give us the Techno Blades to protect? Why are they so important?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Because together, they can reboot the system, wipe the master computer clean, and destroy the Overlord virus for good.
Jay::: Wow.
Cole:::Cool. 
Nya::: What is it?
P.I.X.A.L.::: I didn't come alone.
Jay::: Uh, who else is with you?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Nindroids.
All::: Nindroids?
Jay::: Where are they? I don't see any of them. 
P.I.X.A.L.::: Five versus eighteen. Probability of survival too low to quantify.
Zane::: Whoa!
Jay::: These Nindroids are so much fast— 
Cole::: Nice kick. Now see mine. Ninja, go!
Nya:::No! Your power only strengthens them.
Lloyd::: Ninja, go! 
Nya::: We need to get out of here.
Nindroid::: We've got you now.
Jay::: Anyone want to clear a path?
Cole::: Yeah, I've got an idea. 
Nindroid::: Attack!
Cole:::Won't be long until they figure out we used autopilot. We should get a move on.
Garmadon::: I'm coming with you. If the Overlord wants my son, I'm not letting him out of my sight.
Misako::: I'll stay and look after the monastery.
Lloyd::: Wait. If he wants me, and the Techno Blades are the only things that can stop him, shouldn't we split up, just in case?
Nya::: Good thinking. Zane's Falcon knows the secret location of my Samurai X Cave. You and your father go and take what you need to get as far away from us as possible.
Jay::: Secret cave? I thought we knew everything about each other.
Nya::: Well, a girl's gotta have her secrets.
Lloyd::: What are you guys gonna do? Those Nindroids aren't gonna let you step one foot into the city.
Jay::: Yeah, Nya. What are we gonna do?
Nya::: We're gonna shut down the power.
Overlord::: What do you mean they're not there?
Cryptor::: We've been tricked.
Overlord::: Your Nindroids have failed, General Cryptor, but my next creation won't. 
Magician::: Hehe, no ninja. Wanna check up my sleeves?
Nindroid::: You can go.
Driver::: Thank you. 
Magician::: We can get you just outside of the Storm Farms, but you'll have to get to the power substation on your own. Good luck, and abracadabra! 
Jay:::Show off.
Cole::: So, Nya, shutting down this power substation. Can we really destroy the Overlord and his Nindroids by simply flipping a switch?
Nya::: Cripple them, yes. Destroy, no. Once we've powered down his army, we still need to reboot the central computer with the Techno Blades. And don't forget, since he knows we have them, they aren't gonna let us just waltz in.
Jay::: Whoa! Wait a minute, if shutting down the power turns off everything connected to it, wouldn't that mean P.I.X.A.L. too?
Cole::: Well, if Zane hasn't figured it out, don't tell him. If we're going to come across more Nindroids, we need to be on our A game.
Kai::: Speaking of which, where is Zane?
Zane::: Thank you for repairing me. I guess an old Nindroid like me is no match against the newer models.
P.I.X.A.L.::: This is just one of my primary functions. Gratitude is not required.Fascinating.
Zane::: What is it?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Your power source. It's a technology I am unfamiliar with. Your father built you with spare parts, yet this piece, it's unique. Perhaps if I take a closer look.I'm sorry, I caused you pain. I was curious to understand why you are so different.
Zane::: We're all different. But I don't feel so different around you.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I am not different. I am P.I.X.A.L., the Primary Interactive X-ternal Assistant Life-form. And your repairs are complete.
Lloyd::: The Samurai X symbol.Whoa! How did Nya have time to build all this? Maybe I should've been a Samurai instead.
Garmadon:::Why must everything have so many weapons?
Lloyd::: Says the man who had four arms to possess the Golden Weapons.
Garmadon::: Haha, I deserved that.I swore off fighting, not driving. Yee-haw!
Lloyd::: Where to now?
Garmadon::: As far away as possible.
Cole::: Hey, Nya. How are our kids?
Nya::: Our kids?Why would we have kids? We're not even married, let alone—
Cole::: I mean our students, weirdo. Ever since we left the school, I'm worried for them.
Nya::: Oh, Dareth's looking after them. You know, Cole, you don't get the credit you deserve.
Cole::: What do you mean?
Nya::: I mean, you always put others ahead of yourself. I know the other ninja get all the attention, but I just want you to know, you're a good guy. 
Cole::: Ah, don't tell Jay.
Jay:::Ha, tell me what? 
Nya::: Um...
Kai::: Ha, oh, hope I didn't interrupt anything, 'cause we're here.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Aah!
Zane::: Careful. They farm the electricity that's in the air. This is where all of Ninjago gets their power.
Kai::: Looks like we have a welcoming party.
Nya:::The only chance we have of getting in there is to stay out of sight. There's no way we can take them all on.
Jay::: You mean we get to be ninja for a change? Whoo-hoo!
P.I.X.A.L.::: I'll stay back. I'm not built for stealth and cannot assist you.
Zane::: Be safe and stay out of trouble. I'll see you later.
Cryptor::: Keep your eyes out for ninja. The Overlord says they are sure to be coming.Look at you, last one off the factory line? Ran out of metal, eh? I will call you Min-Droid. 
Nya::: That's the substation's core. Shut that down, and it's lights out for the Overlord. Now if only we knew which switch. 
Music:::We say, go go! You're gonna see us rip into it. We just jump up kick back whip around and spin—
Jay:::Hey, I love this song.
Kai::: Turn it off! They can't know we're here.
Jay::: Pfft. Buzzkill. 
Cole::: None of these buttons are doing anything. There has to be an easier way.
Kai::: Yeah, like maybe just hack the system?Argh! Stupid technology.
Cole::: This can't be harder than it looks.Okay, definitely harder.
Jay::: Button, button, who's got the button?
Cole::: Be quiet.
Jay::: I am being quiet. You be quiet. 
Cryptor::: Ninja!
P.I.X.A.L.::: The ninja have been discovered. Operation jeopardized. Calculating probability of success to affecting outcome by—Oh, who cares about probability?
Cryptor::: Knock, knock. 
Nya::: Nindroids! Our cover is blown! Seal the doors and find a way to shut it down.
Zane:::P.I.X.A.L.! Don't seal the door. I'm going out there.
Jay::: Are you crazy? We barely fixed you up the last time you fought them.
Zane::: You didn't fix me, she did. 
Jay::: Argh! Great. Now they come in fun size!
Lloyd::: Huh?
Garmadon::: We need to go. Now!Come on, start!
Lloyd:::Argh! He's gaining on us.
Garmadon::: Well maybe this thing has an afterburner.Curse these weapons.
Zane::: Ninja, go!
Cryptor::: The original Nindroid. You're nothing more than a tin can with feelings.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Zane, watch out!
Cryptor::: Welcome to the future.
Kai::: Hack him with the Techno Blade.
Cole::: Argh! I'm trying! I gotta hand it to the little runt. He doesn't know when to quit.
Min-Droid::: Quit? 
Kai::: Ah, that's it. Fight without fighting!
Jay::: This is no time for a lesson, Kai!
Kai::: Hey, Half Pint! Over here! Whoa! We need to provoke him more.
Cole::: Or more Nindroids. Nya, open the door!
Nya::: I see where you're headed.It's working!
Lloyd::: Look out!
Garmadon::: This is why I took an oath of peace!
Min-Droid::: Uh, oh.
Lloyd::: Yeah! All right!
Kai::: We did it!
P.I.X.A.L.::: This is why I wanted to stay back. So you would not s-s-see this.
Zane::: You knew this would happen?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Your mission was important. I-I was not. I am to assist. I assisted.
Zane::: You're using up your reserve. Don't say anything more until we find you more power.
P.I.X.A.L.::: You've destroyed the only power source in Ninjago. Power will all be nonexistent. We are not so different, are we? We are compatible?
Zane::: Yes, yes we are.
Lloyd::: Do you think it's safe to go back?
Garmadon::: They may have turned off the power, but they still need to reboot the system. Until we know the Overlord is gone for good, we need to keep moving.
