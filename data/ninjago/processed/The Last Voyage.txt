Zane::: Hmm, most peculiar. Yesterday there was just ocean, but now there is an island.
Wu::: The Dark Island, Zane. And what I find more peculiar is after Ninjago City was attacked by the Stone Army, today they have vanished.
Zane::: Do you think they are on this Dark Island? Garmadon may be responsible.
Wu::: I fear that too. But what's most important is we have to find out what is on that island.
Zane::: Perhaps my Falcon can have a look.
Jay:::Ugh, useless pile of junk.
Nya::: Oh, it's worse than I feared. The rotors on the starboard booster are completely destroyed. The port boosters are shot from the strain. Oh, sorry guys. She's not getting airborne anytime soon.
Cole::: So if the Stone Army attacks again, we're sitting ducks.
Jay::: Uh, ducks can fly, Cole. Weren't you listening?
Kai::: We just got our tails handed to us and we couldn't even stop one of them. Ugh, I hate feeling helpless.
Wu::: We mustn't give up hope, Kai.
Lloyd::: But the Stone Army is indestructible. You saw it. At best, all my powers could do was slow them down.
Misako::: That's not entirely true. There is a way to defeat them. And it is told within the scrolls.The prophecy reveals that the power to defeat the Stone Army lies within the Green Ninja.
Lloyd::: I tried. I gave them everything I had.
Misako::: Yes, but you are stronger than you think. Look. The true power of the Green Ninja can only be unlocked when his four protectors find their own pure elemental powers.
Cole::: Are we the protectors?
Jay::: Pfft, silly question. Of course we are. Haha, right?
Zane::: If we are the protectors, then we're doomed. Our elemental Golden Weapons no longer exist. We cannot tap into our elemental powers without them.
Misako::: But the powers do exist within each of you. And there is a way to unlock your powers on your own. We must go to the Temple of Light.
Nya::: Temple of Light? What's that?
Misako::: The gold in the Golden Weapons was from the Golden Peaks, but they were forged in the Temple of Light, a powerful place I thought only existed in legend.
Wu::: It's on the Dark Island?
Misako::: I think our only choice is to find out.
Cole::: So we get our powers back? All right!
Nya::: But there's still one big problem: the Bounty can't fly.
Misako::: It's a ship, right? Can't it sail?
Jay::: Silly question. Of course it can. Haha, right?
Edna::: Now promise me you'll eat your vegetables.
Jay::: Mom!
Edna::: Oh, I mean it. You get sluggish when you don't get enough vitamins. Ed, tell him if he's gonna save the world, he has to eat his vegetables.
Ed::: Uh, do what your mother says.
Lou::: I don't know what to say.
Cole::: You don't have to say anything.
Lou::: You're right. I don't have to say anything. But I do have to sing.Who's gonna save Ninjago's hide? Who's gonna make a dad swell with pride? Cole is! Cole does! Cole, Cole, Cole. 
Cole::: That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard, Pop.
Kai::: Now, Dareth, as the honorary Brown Ninja, we're entrusting you with protecting Ninjago and tending to the Ultra Dragon. Are you up to the tasks?
Dareth::: I won't let you guys down. Did you hear that? I'm officially the Brown Ninja!Oh, what's my elemental power?
Nya::: Uh, hot air?
Dareth::: So I command the wind. Cool.
Lloyd:::You need to stay here, big guy. These people need your protection.
Wu::: Is there anyone you would like to say goodbye to?
Zane::: My only family is my Falcon. And my only memory of my father was nearly erased. I will miss Ninjago for it's all I know, but I am excited to see what the future has in store.
Wu::: Well, my Nindroid friend, there are a few people who would like to say goodbye to you. 
Rufus::: I love you, you stupid Nindroid.
Wu::: Pupils, it's time we set sail.
Jay::: Goodbye!
Cole::: See you!
Kai::: So long!
Dareth:::You see that? It's working!
Edna::: Jay! Did you make sure to pack clean underwear?
Jay::: Yes, mom! 
Wu::: We still have a long journey ahead of us.
Cole::: Still no word from your Falcon?
Zane::: Not yet.
Kai::: I wonder what's on the island?
Zane::: An entirely new ecosystem?
Cole::: Never before seen creatures?
Jay::: Oh, vegetables that taste like dessert?
Kai::: I hope the Stone Army is there. They may have gotten the best of us once, but never again.
Cole::: You said it.
Jay::: Hear, hear.
Lloyd::: I wonder if this is the end of our destiny.
Kai::: If it is, there isn't anyone else I'd want on by my side.
Jay::: Hear, hear.
Cole::: You said it.
Zane:::He's...he's gone.
Wu::: We don't know that.
Nya::: Oh, Zane. I'm so sorry.
Kai::: Well, he was our friend too, so we're not gonna let him go in vain. If the Stone Army wants a fight, they got one.
Misako::: Well, that's going to have to wait because right now, we're sailing straight for a storm. All hands on deck.
Garmadon::: This is foolish. I have an unbeatable army to conquer Ninjago and yet we waste time playing in the mud?
Overlord::: What you call "mud" is concentrated evil. A Dark Matter that with one drop could make a man's heart turn as black as night. Have patience, Garmadon. The superweapon the likes of which has never before been seen.
Garmadon::: Hmm. A superweapon? I like the sound of that! 
Cole::: Hold the line!
Lloyd::: The winds are too strong!
Zane::: We need everyone's help, Jay!
Jay::: But I don't wanna get wet. I...I only have one pair of underwear.
Kai::: Jay, this is no time to be making jokes. The Bounty can only take so much.
Jay::: You think I'm trying to be funny?Okay, laugh all you want, but we'll see who laughs last when I have to go commando.
Kai::: Who's laughing?
Nya::: Ugh. It sounds like some of us are getting a kick out of this.
Misako::: That's not laughter.
Wu::: What is that sound?
Misako:::Starteeth.
Kai::: Uh, guys, why is the sea laughing at us?
Jay::: And why do I have a feeling we're not gonna get the joke? 
Cole::: Hey, what's that? 
Zane, Kai, and Lloyd::: Whoa!
Jay::: I'm coming! I got it!
Kai::: About time, Jay!
Jay:::Oh, perfect!
Cole::: It looks like some sort of a, hmm, fish. 
Misako::: Wait! We must not let the Starteeth on board. They devour ships and won't stop until we sink!
Cole:::Ow! It bit me!
Kai::: Huh, get these things off the ship!Aargh. I'm starstruck! Unh, good riddance, water vampires! 
Lloyd::: Faster! Or we'll sink!
Jay::: Get off there!Oh, my! Aah! Get them off! Get them off!
Kai::: Use your Spinjitzu!
Jay::: Ninja, go!Okay, bad idea.
Everyone but Jay::: Ninja, go! 
Kai::: Sink your teeth into this!
Jay:::They eat through metal too?
Lloyd::: Uh, guys, I think we have a bigger problem. 
Jay::: Oh, I should have brought an extra pair of underwear.
Kai::: Ah, this is hopeless! Now that we have no rudder we've been drifting aimlessly and we'll never get to the Dark Island.
Misako::: We only know what is foretold will happen. Not when it will happen.
Wu::: What is it, Zane?
Zane::: I sense something.
Cole::: Is it the Falcon?
Jay::: Is he all right?
Zane::: No. It's...something else. Brace yourselves!
Lloyd::: Who would build a lighthouse way out here?
Zane::: It's not a lighthouse. It's a prison.
Jay::: Oh, I should have brought an extra pair of underwear.
Wu::: Mysterious. We better keep going.
Jay:::Uh, should we smile?
Julien::: Zane! Is it really you?You found me!
Lloyd::: Uh, do you know him?
Julien::: Of course I know him, I built him for heaven's sake!
Zane::: But my memory tells me that you have passed.
Julien::: Ah, you found your memory switch.Hurry, it can't know that you're here, or else there'll be dues to pay.
Jay:::"It?"
Julien::: I'll explain everything inside, including why it is that you thought I was dead.
Nya::: Well, the Bounty's sailing days are over.
Wu::: Come, Nya.
Julien::: Locking, barricading, hand checking.I think we're safe. This way.Please, please have a seat. You must be thirsty.
Zane::: Seat, where?
Julien:::There of course.
Nya::: Wow, that's pretty smart.
Cole::: A technical wizard.
Zane::: Father, I don't understand. I-I saw you pass.
Julien::: Yes, you did, and believe me when I tell you, I thought I was kaput, but as you know in Ninjago, the past is the past.
Misako::: And the future...
Wu::: ...is the future.
Julien::: Yes. But after I turned off your memory switch, what you didn't see is bonehead elixir. He wanted me to create state-of-the-art war machines for their army. He said if I did, then I would be able to see my son again. And to make sure I didn't escape, he chained a Leviathan to keep guard.
Lloyd::: A Leviathan? That's what we heard in the ocean?
Julien::: Yes. When Samukai didn't return, I thought I would never see you again. But as so much time has passed I started to question if you would ever want to see me again. I was afraid if you found out what horrible things I've created, you would think I was a...a monster.
Zane::: We will get you out of here, Father. Now that we are together, perhaps we can invent a way off this rock.
Jay::: Could you repair the rocket boosters on our ship?
Julien::: That sailing ship has rocket boosters?
Nya::: Well, the rotors and gears are shot.
Julien::: Eh, pish posh. No matter! I'll have your ship airworthy by dawn!
Cole::: It's an earthquake!
Julien::: No, it's much worse! He's here. Everyone hide!Nobody make a sound.Aha, if it isn't my old chum.Hehe, just marching to the beat of my own drum. You know, doing whatever I can to pass the time. Since I'm so, you know, heh, alone. 
Kai::: If we're gonna make something and get out of here, we're gonna have to hurry before it comes back.
Cole:::What? It's catchy.
Julien:::Excuse me, but I must say, I have never had such a meal in all my life. Where did you learn to cook? I never programmed that into you.
Zane::: I guess I just picked it up. Father, if I wanted you to make a change in me, would you?
Julien::: A change?
Zane::: An alteration.
Julien::: Heh, but Zane, you're perfect. I could never make you any better than you already are.
Zane::: But I see no reason for me to have a memory switch. I happen to like my life and don't want to ever forget you again.
Julien::: Don't worry, my son. We will both never forget. I'm glad you found me.
Zane::: I'm glad you made me.
Julien::: Everyone aboard! It's coming!
Kai::: It's here!
Jay::: Get us out of here, Nya!
Nya::: I hope she's ready!Come on! 
Wu::: Lloyd! Use your Elemental Powers!
Lloyd::: As you wish, Sensei! Release us, you monster!
Wu::: Well done, Lloyd! 
Zane::: It's chained! 
Julien::: Zane! What are you doing?
Zane::: The Leviathan won't let us leave. I think I know a way I can help.
Julien::: But you can't jump in. These oceans are filled with Starteeth.
Zane::: I know. 
Julien::: Zane! No!
Lloyd::: Help!
Kai::: It let us go.
Julien::: What happened?
Lloyd::: Zane released the Leviathan, and now it's letting us go.
Julien::: But where is my son?
Zane:::I'm here, Father!
Julien::: Zane! Zane.
Wu::: How did you know if you freed it from captivity it would let us go?
Zane::: Because no one deserves to be held captive. Not even a monster.Farewell, creature from the sea. Enjoy your freedom.
