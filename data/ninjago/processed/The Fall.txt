The Omega::: So, this is the Realm of the First Spinjitzu Master? Soon, their power will be gone. Forever.
Lloyd::: Power?Father, what is he talking about?
Garmadon::: What do you think? Power of your grandfather, the power of Creation.
The Omega:::Soon, there will be nothing, but Destruction.You. You are Oni. Why have you not taken this realm?
Garmadon:::Well, I... it's complicated. Enough talk. Let's get this over with.
Lloyd:::Ha-aahh!!Uah-ahh.
Garmadon:::Is that the worst you can do? I'm growing bored.Don't just sit there. Get up and fight!
Lloyd::: Aagh! Unh!The Sword of Sanctuary. The future is reflected in its blade.Try that again.Huh?Guess they don't care much about the future.I'm getting tired of this.
Garmadon:::So am I! How did you ever defeat me in the first place?Took you long enough.
Lloyd::: Oh, come on! That was awesome!
Garmadon::: It was adequate.
The Omega::: Fool!The Realm Crystal was merely the key in which we opened the gateway. Destroying it will accomplish nothing.
Lloyd:::You said it would stop them!
Garmadon::: Well I...
Lloyd::: Well, what?
Garmadon::: I thought it would work!
Lloyd::: Well, you thought wrong! 
Garmadon::: Maybe we should consider another tactic. 
Lloyd::: What are you waiting for?! Blast a hole into the next vault!
Garmadon::: There aren't any more vaults! Bedrock. No way through.
Lloyd:::Try that wall!Aw-unh.
Garmadon::: I want you to know I blame you for all of this.
Lloyd:::Me?! This is your plan!Why aren't they attacking us? 
Lloyd and Garmadon::: The Armor of the Golden Master! 
Garmadon::: Look at them. They fear it!
Lloyd:::It was forged from the Four Weapons of Spinjitzu. They should!
Garmadon::: Haha! Back! Nice try! 
Lloyd::: It's not working too well on that one.Yah! 
Garmadon::: Heh. Well enough.
The Omega:::You are only delaying the inevitable. More and more of us are coming. We will destroy you!
Lloyd::: Not today, you won't! 
Garmadon:::Back! Get up!Okay, on three, we run. One, two, three!
Lloyd:::Zane! Nya! Get us out of here! Lower the zip lines. Lower the zip lines!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Lloyd, I'm standing by for your extraction. Locking onto your coordinates now!
Lloyd::: P.I.X.? Where's the Bounty?
P.I.X.A.L.::: They are attending to a distress call. I remained behind in case of an emergency. I have your coordinates. I'm on my way. 
Lloyd::: No! You can't enter the cloud! We have no idea what it would do to you!
P.I.X.A.L.::: I am a Nindroid. I should be able to withstand the cloud's effects.
Lloyd::: We don't know that!
P.I.X.A.L.::: As you once said, we're about to find out.
Automated Response::: Warning: Fuel levels low. Four percent remaining. 
Nya::: How much farther to that distress call?
Zane::: Should be approaching it now?
Cole::: I don't see it.
Kai:::There! That's gotta be it!
Nya::: That's the Ninjago News Center.
Kai::: It's covered in those... things.
Cole::: I guess they didn't evacuate in time.
Nya::: I'll bring us in over the rooftop. You guys, get them out of there before the clouds swallow the entire building.
Jay::: Come on, Cole! 
Gayle:::"As the black cloud of destruction grows ever closer, surrounding us on all sides, this intrepid reporter vows to stay at her desk and bring you the news until the bitter end." Hmm. "Tragic end?" "Terrible end?"Would you guys keep it down? I'm about to go on air!
Vinny::: It's the ninja! They're here! We're being rescued!Come on, we got to get to the roof!
Gayle Gossip::: Great.Now I have to rewrite this whole thing.
Cole::: Hey, folks, need a lift?
Vinny::: Boy, are we glad to see you guys! Thanks!
Jay:::Our pleasure! Mind your step now.
Cole:::Uh, a little quicker, folks?
Jay::: Creepy black vines closing in!
Gayle::: You should know, you just ruined a heck of a broadcast. 
Cole:::What?Ah!
Jay::: Okay, Nya! Get us out of here!
Nya::: You got it! 
Cole:::Uh oh!Aaaahhhh!!!Unh! Ah, unh.
Jay::: Cole!
Nya::: Ugh! I keep forgetting that! 
Cole:::Whoaa!!Ah. Oof. Ow.Ow, ow, ow. Oof.
Jay:::Hang on, Cole!
Cole::: Ow.I got it! I think I did!Ah! 
Jay:::COLE!!! 
Automated Response::: Warning: Fuel levels low. Three percent remaining.
Lloyd:::Where are you, P.I.X.A.L.?! We need you! P.I.X.A.L.!
P.I.X.A.L.::: I am in bound. Brace for extraction. And Lloyd?
Lloyd::: Yeah.
P.I.X.A.L.::: We're only going to get one shot at this. I'm almost out of fuel.
Lloyd::: I understand. We're ready.
Lloyd::: Nice, P.I.X.A.L.! Whoa!Tower, tower, tower! 
Lloyd and Garmadon::: Whoa!! 
P.I.X.A.L.::: Zane! Nya! This is P.I.X.A.L. I have Lloyd and Garmadon, but we are low on fuel. We need a little help. Where are you guys?!
Automated Response::: Warning: One percent remaining. One percent.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Nya. Come in. Nya!
Nya::: P.I.X.A.L.! We're heading your way. ETA: Two minutes!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Copy that. This is going to be close.
Automated Response::: Warning: One percent remaining. One percent.
Lloyd::: Hang on, guys! 
Zane:::Guys, P.I.X.A.L. is running on fumes. Unless we hurry, we will not reach her in time.
Nya::: Oh, yes, we will. I'm not losing anyone else today. 
Kai, Jay, Zane:::Whooaa!! 
Automated Response:::Fuel reserves: Zero percent. Zero percent. Engine failure.Eject. Eject. Eject. Eject. Eject. Eject. Eject.Eject. 
P.I.X.A.L.::: I am sorry. I tried.Brace for impact! 
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L.! Are you okay?
P.I.X.A.L.::: I am unhurt. 
Jay::: Lloyd, are you okay?
Lloyd:::Yeah. Yeah. I think so.
Garmadon::: So am I. Nobody has to worry about me. 
Lloyd:::What? What is it?Where's Cole?Where's Cole?Somebody say something.Where's Cole?!
Zane:::He... H-he's gone.
Lloyd::: What do you mean "gone?”
Kai::: Lloyd. He fell... into the cloud.
Nya::: I... I'm so sorry.
Lloyd::: He's... He's really... gone? 
Nya::: It was my fault. I pulled the thrust lever the wrong way, and... 
Jay:::It wasn't your fault. It was an accident.
Kai::: It could have happened to anyone.
Garmadon:::Okay, let's get going.
Lloyd:::Do you mind?!
Garmadon:::Yes, I do.We are wasting valuable time! All that matters now is this. 
Kai:::The Golden Armor.
Zane::: What about the Realm Crystal?
Garmadon:::It didn't work, but this will!They fear it.
Lloyd::: Cole was our friend. He was more than a friend, he was family. But you don't understand that, do you?What's the point? You're never gonna get it! Because you don't care about anyone, but yourself!
Garmadon:::Every moment you delay risks our survival!
Lloyd:::There's more to life than SURVIVING!! AUGH!! 
Garmadon::: How do you reason with that? You, Nindroid, if any of you are capable of logical thought, it is you. Tell them!
Zane:::I'm happy to say, you are mistaken. At this moment, even I am incapable of logical thought. 
Vinny::: Whoa! S-sorry. Oh, man.You're-you're Garmadon.
Garmadon::: And you are?
Vinny::: Duh. Uh. Vinny?.
Garmadon::: Are you a-a ninja?
Vinny::: Me? What? Uh, heck no. I'm-I'm a camera guy with NGTV News. I work with Gayle Gossip. Wow! Sorry. I'm-I'm kind of tripping that I'm in the same room with you. You-you-you-you're Garmadon!
Garmadon::: What do you want, Vinny of NGTV News?
Vinny::: Oh, uh. I just looking for the bathroom?
Garmadon::: This is not it.
Vinny::: Right. Uh, thanks. 
Garmadon::: Wait. I have a query.
Vinny::: Uh, s-sure. Fire away.
Garmadon::: What could possibly be more important than survival?
Vinny::: Oh, well. Lots of things. Friendship, man, and-and-and love, and harmony, and trust, and truth, and courage, and you know, all the stuff that makes life worthwhile. Without those, I mean, what's the point? Right?
Garmadon:::Huh. Indeed.You may leave now, Vinny of NGTV News. 
Kai:::Hi, sis.You okay?
Nya:::No.
Kai::: Me neither.
Nya::: I just can't help thinking, if only I'd pushed the handle the right way.
Kai:::Hey. It was an accident.Cole loved you like a brother. I mean, a sister. I mean a—you know.
Nya::: I just... can't believe he's gone.
Kai::: Neither can I. But Cole would want us to keep fighting. And you're the brains here, sis, so...
Nya::: Me?
Kai::: You're the one who's always building everything and coming up with all the plans, you and Zane. And Zane's not much use at the moment.
Nya::: Yeah. Right. Okay. Let's set a course for the Monastery of Spinjitzu. It has a forge.
Kai::: Forge?
Nya::: To melt down the Golden Armor. Kai, the Golden Armor was forged out of the Weapons of Spinjitzu, so...
Kai::: So...?
Nya::: So, if we can melt it down and forge it back into weapons, we can use those to fight the Oni!
Kai::: Ha. That's a great idea. I'll tell the others.W-w-w-wait. The Weapons of Spinjitzu were forged at the Temple of Light. You can't just go to any old blacksmith.
Nya::: I'm not. I'm coming to you.
Kai::: Me? Uh, are you crazy? I'm a terrible blacksmith, remember? You used to tell me that all the time.
Nya::: You're the Elemental Master of Fire, Kai. Your fire can melt down the armor. You're the only chance we have.
Kai:::So a future of all Ninjago depends on my blacksmithing abilities?
Nya::: Yup.Pretty much.
Kai:::No pressure.
Past Jay:::Hang on, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole.
Past Cole:::I got it! I g-g-g-g-g—
Past Jay:::Cole!
