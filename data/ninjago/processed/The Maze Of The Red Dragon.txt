Okino:::I am Okino. Samurai of Terra Karana. My entire existence I have sought to fulfill my duty, guiding my masters across the dangers of Terra Karana. I have failed many times.But now, I have masters truly worthy of my honorable efforts. I will not fail them!
Okino::: We must stay together. The Maze of the Red Dragon has many twists and turns.
Jay::: Pfft! No problem. I'm great at mazes.
Cole::: This might be harder than the ones you're used to on the backs of cereal boxes. 
Cole::: Huh. Those statues look familiar.
Nya::: Yeah. He's right. Those are just like the statues we saw at Dyer Island!
Cole::: Oh, yeah! The ones that shot lasers at us- 
Cole and Nya::: Woah!
Okino::: Go! Quickly!
Jay::: Gotcha!
Okino::: They are many traps here. You must always be aware of your surroundings.
Lloyd::: Good safety tip. Right, guys?Thanks, Okino.
Nya::: That... was close.Jay...
Jay::: Heheh.Which way now?
Cole::: Uh, Okino. Any ideas? Left or right- 
Okino:::Master Lloyd? Nya? Jay? What is wrong? What has happened? 
Voice::: Okino, my son.
Okino::: Unagami! 
Unagami::: You may rise.
Okino::: It is an honor to be in your presence.
Unagami::: Yet I sense something's troubles you.
Okino::: The ninja. They have told me things. About Terra Karana. Things that are difficult to believe.
Unagami::: They have told you that this world is not real? That you are not real?This is true. You were born in this realm. A place of illusion, a shadow of the real world. But you are not bound to this place. I am building a machine. A wondrous device that will allow you to enter the real world. Would you like to go there?
Okino::: Hai.
Unagami::: Then I shall bring you with me. But you must help me.
Okino::: How?
Unagami:::The ninja seek to stop me and destroy the machine. Instead, they must be destroyed.
Okino::: But, they are my friends. They trusted me.
Unagami:::If you help the ninja, you will never see the real world. You will remain trapped here in this illusion forever!
Okino::: But I, I am a guide. It would be dishonorable to betray my masters!
Empire Dragon::: You chose strangers over me?! Your creator?! Do your duties, Samurai! You will hear from me again... when the time is near!
Cole::: Right?
Lloyd::: Okino? Are you okay? 
Okino::: I... I... I am okay.
Cole::: So, which way? Left or right?
Okino::: As we near the heart of the maze, the danger will grow.
Lloyd::: We trust you, Okino.
Okino::: Down. All of you! 
Nya::: Thanks again, Okino.
Okino::: It is my duty. Run!Leap!Roll, quick! 
Jay::: Cole!
Cole::: Get this thing off of me!It's okay, it's not that bad. But I could use a booby trap break.
Okino::: We can rest for a moment. It is safe here.
Nya::: Are we getting close to the Key-Tana yet?
Okino::: Hai. The heart of the maze is near. May I ask something?
Lloyd::: Of course, Okino.
Okino::: Why do you seek the Key-Tana?
Lloyd::: We need it to stop Unagami, to free everyone who's been trapped inside the game.
Okino::: They are your friends?
Lloyd::: Well, not really. But they're innocent people, and they're in danger. We have a duty to help them, right?
Jay::: There it is! The Key-Tana!
Okino::: Shh! Speak softly!
Nya::: Could've been worse.
Kai::: How?
Nya::: It could've been awake. If we're quiet, we can sneak by, grab the Key-Tana, and get out of here before it wakes up.
Okino::: That is a wise plan. But one of you must retrieve the Key-Tana. I can only guide a quest, not complete one.
Nya::: I'll go.
Lloyd::: No, it should be the one with the highest Stealth rating.
Jay::: It's me. I've been in the game longest and upgraded my Stealth the most. 
Lloyd::: Uh oh.
Jay::: Hit it!
Cole::: We gotta knock its hind forces down!*
Kai::: Our hits aren't working!
Nya::: There has to be a way to bring it down!
Okino::: The Red Dragon's weak point is - 
Unagami::: It is time. All you must do is remain silent. Let them perish. Do not help them.
Okino::: But, they trust me.
Unagami::: Remember what I offered. Escape, freedom, a place in the real world.
Okino::: In the real world? 
Lloyd::: Okino! There's gotta be a way to defeat him!
Nya::: Okino, help us!
Okino::: I choose my own path! 
Lloyd::: The scale! That's the dragon's weak point! Hit the scale in the middle of his back!
Nya::: I see it!
Cole::: Yeah! We can do this!
Okino::: You have defeated the dragon. The amulet is yours.You are empowered to call upon the dragon in a future battle, but once, and only once.
Lloyd::: We did it!
Nya::: We did it with your help, Okino. 
Unagami::: You have betrayed me, Okino, but you have only doomed yourself. The gate will still be built, but you will never see it. Never! 
Jay::: Thanks, Okino.
Cole::: You were great.
Lloyd::: Yeah, you should come with us, Okino. You were a big help.
Okino::: I thank you, but I must go my own way.For too long, I have followed the ways of others.I am Okino, Ronin of Terra Karana. No longer do I guide others on their adventures. Now, I seek my own adventure.
