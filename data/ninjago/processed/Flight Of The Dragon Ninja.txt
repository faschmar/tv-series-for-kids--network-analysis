Jay::: Why must we go through this again? I'm clearly the best. I mean, look at me!
Jay::: Well, Iâ€”
Cole::: Jay's only point is that he won last time, so obviously he thinks he'll hold the title of Dragon Master forever.
Kai::: Well technically, riding your dragon is kind of training.
Cole::: So we all agree, whoever wins this one will be the new Dragon Master for a month. Ready?
Ninja::: Ninja, go!
Zane::: May the best man win!
Kai::: See ya!
Zane::: W-where did he go?
Kai:::Need a light?! 
Zane::: Woah!
Kai::: Hahaha.
Zane::: Time to fight Fire with Ice!
Zane:::Feeling a little chilly?
Cole::: Woah! Yeah, Rocky! Way to go!
Cole::: Well, guys. Time to activate the turbo. Eat my dust! 
Cole::: Way to go, Rocky! We are an awesome team!
Kai::: Nice run, bro, but we'll get you tomorrow.
Cole:::Tomorrow? We agreed that the winner was gonna be Dragon Master for a month!
Zane::: I don't recall agreeing to that.
Cole::: Nah-uh!
Kai::: Oh, brother!
