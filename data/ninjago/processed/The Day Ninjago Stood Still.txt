All except the Generals:::Skales! Skales! Skales! 
Skales:::Idiot.Oh, thank you, thank you.Get down, get down.You're too kind!Scram. Go, go, go.Hypnobrai, Venomari, Constrictai, and Fangpyre. Hear me! The troubled reign of that duplicitous human Garmadon...
Mezmo:::You're it.
Spitta::: No, you're it.
Skales::: ...is finally at an end. At last, our time has come.
Mezmo::: Hahaha, not you! 
Skales::: We Serpentine must now unite in a common destiny. To secure our place as rulers of Ninjago, and not let those insufferable surface dwellers win. So as my first order, I say we burrow beneath their beloved city, to bury them as they once buried us! Fellow Serpentine, it's time we knock Ninjago City back down to size!
Cole::: Don't rely on your eyes. Use your ears.
Dareth::: Uh, guys, I'm teaching a class later, so I'd appreciate a clean dojo.
Jay::: Aah!
Dareth::: Ah! No, no, no! No, no, no! No! No, no, no.
Jay::: Aah!
Dareth::: No, no, no, no! 
Jay::: Hey, open the window! Let me in!
Misako::: I'd forgotten how pale Garmadon was before his change to evil was complete.
Wu:::Misako, once again, you slip through my defenses.
Misako::: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. I brought my research on the prophecy of the Green Ninja. I thought maybe we could go over it together.
Wu:::Hmm, my. There's so much. It will take days. 
Misako::: I should have chosen you.
Wu:::The past is the past.
Misako::: Yes, but there's always the future. 
Wu::: The ground moves. I fear unnatural causes. 
Gayle:::NGTV reporter Gayle Gossip on the scene of what appears to be an earthquake rocking the city of Ninjago. But it's an earthquake like no other, as scientists have yet to pinpoint the cause. And more frightening still, the aftershocks are getting stronger.
Cole::: What do you think this could be?
Kai::: Wouldn't be surprised if it was Garmadon. We haven't seen him for a while.
Misako::: He would never. Lloyd's father is evil, but he would never do anything to put his son in harm's way.
Wu::: Misako's right. He only tried to thwart his training. This is something else.
Jay::: But what is it?
Zane:::My friend, be my eyes and look for danger in the streets from above.
Skales::: Drill, baby, drill!Ugh! Disgusting! This infernal Devourer's venom has seeped everywhere!Ugh. Why are we stopping?
Snike::: My lord, we've hit something. We can't dig through.
Skales::: Nonsense! There is no such thing. 
Fangtom::: It's ancient. Perhaps older than the Serpentine themselves.
Garmadon::: This is madness! You test me, Lord Garmadon?! Ninjago's rightful ruler?!
Overlord::: Patience, Garmadon. All will make sense in time. For now, follow my instructions.
Garmadon::: To what end? What is so important at the top of this cliff?
Overlord::: The key to the greatest army ever seen. And the means to the greatest weapon ever known.
Garmadon::: What good will these things do for me, marooned on this uninhabited island? How will I return to Ninjago?
Overlord::: My master plan has been in the works since the beginning of time. Every piece moves in perfect harmony like the gears of clock, slowly shifting the balance of power back to darkness. Every piece, that is, but you.
Garmadon::: All right, then.
Woman:::Oh, Snickers! Stay there, Mommy's coming!No, no! Stay where you are! Help! Help me!
Lloyd::: Ninja to the rescue! Go!
Zane::: Go!
Kai::: Go!
Jay::: Go!
Lloyd::: Few more inches, guys. 
Cole::: Appreciate the support, doggy.Ugh. Could have thought this plan through a little more.No more help, please! 
Woman::: Oh, thank you!
Lloyd::: No sweat.
Cole::: Speak for yourself. I did all the work.Ugh!
Kai::: These things keep coming with no warning.
Misako::: That's it. A warning. The scrolls said the earthquakes would be a warning. A warning for something far worse to come.
Jay::: Far worse? What could be far worse?
Cole::: Misako, the indestructible Stone Warrior we fought yesterday. Where did you find him?
Misako::: He was buried under the city.
Jay:::You don't think there's more, do you?
Wu::: Be on guard, ninja. We must be ready for whatever comes our way.
Skales::: I will not accept defeat! This wall must be destroyed if we are to bring down Ninjago City. Call for every Serpentine and—what's this? 
Skalidor::: It looks like you, Skales.
Skales::: That's impossible.Get away, you imbecile.
Chokun::: Ugh! Sorry.
Skales:::Spooky.Spooky.
Lizaru::: Look at me, I'm a stiff. 
Mezmo::: So stiff. 
Skales::: What? It's a trap! Attack!
Acidicus::: Our powers have no effect on them. Do we retreat?
Skales::: No retreat. We're Serpentine, we fight!We'll be trapped underground again. No. This can't be true!Noooo!Nooo!
Zane::: Sensei, it's as we feared. Another Stone Samurai Warrior is loose on the streets.
Kai::: No. No.
Jay::: No!
Wu::: We're under attack!
Gayle:::As this army of stone statues sweeps over the city, no one is safe. Mayhem and destruction are their only want. Attempts at communication have failed, prohibiting even the desperate option of surrender! The mayor has already called for a massive evacuation!
Rufus:::Huh? What's this? 
Postman::: What about the privacy of the mail? 
Dareth::: Run!Heh, you picked on the wrong dojo.Okay, warm-up's over. Let's get serious.Nice knowing you. 
Vinny::: That's it, I'm out of here. 
Gayle::: Quitter!Ugh! You! Wanna be my cameraman?
Dareth::: Uh...not really.
Gayle::: Great! Follow me! I need this shot. You getting this?
Dareth::: Uh, I hope so. 
Gayle:::I'm standing outside Grand Sensei Dareth's Mojo Dojo, training headquarters of the ninja, only to find that even here, no one is safe.
Dareth:::Uh, Gayle, um—
Gayle::: Hey. I talk, you film.
Dareth::: But Gayle—
Gayle::: No buts. 
Zane::: You seem in need of assistance.
Gayle::: Thanks, Mr. Ninja.
Cole::: Stay strong. Show no weakness.
Wu::: We have to protect the people. Gather as many as you can and get them to our evacuation point.
Nya:::We've got problems with that evacuation point, guys. I can't find a safe place to land!
Gayle::: The NGTV office building has a helipad on the roof.
Wu::: Yes. Higher ground. Lloyd, tell Nya to head there.
Gayle:::Citizens of Ninjago who have yet to evacuate the city, head to the NGTV building rooftop. Our heroic ninja will evacuate you from there! But hurry. We're running out of time.
Wu:::And you, stay safe. Stay out of trouble.
Misako::: Looks like that won't be possible.
Lloyd::: Uh-oh. There are more of them.Yeah! Haha!
Wu::: Lloyd, did you practice your Elemental Quakes?
Lloyd::: Who needs to practice when you're a natural?Thanks, boy. Now see if you can help us find a way out of here.Good. Now save yourself!
Garmadon::: What is this?
Overlord::: This clock was created to countdown to the Final Battle. Once one takes the Helmet of Shadows, the clock will start.But be warned, though he who wears the Helmet of Shadows can travel between the Islands at will, once it is removed, the countdown cannot be stopped.
Garmadon::: Any more warnings?
Overlord::: No.
Overlord::: At last, the countdown to the Final Battle has begun. This helmet is your birthright. With it, you have control of the army.
Garmadon::: What army?
Overlord::: My army.
Cole::: Barricade the doors.
Zane::: Now we head to the stairwell.
Dareth::: Stairs? It's twenty floors. Let's just take the elevator, guys. 
Zane::: It's unwise to take the elevator during an emergency, Dareth.
Dareth::: Well, I think I'll take my chances.Okay, stairs it is. Let's get climbing, everybody!Guys, I need to rest.Second wind! 
Zane::: We must buy time for our getaway.
Ninja::: Ninja, go! 
Lloyd:::Lightning up!Not so tough.Whoa. So tough.
Zane::: Let's hope we bought enough time.
Dareth:::Where's the Bounty?
Misako::: Look! 
Lloyd::: Hurry, they're coming.
Misako::: My research!
Lloyd::: No, Mom. It's too dangerous to go back.
Misako::: It's too important to leave behind. 
Kai::: Now, now!
Lloyd::: They just keep coming.
Cole::: Go, go!
Nya:::Oh, no. This is bad. We have everyone. We've gotta get out of here. Our only remaining booster won't last much longer.
Lloyd::: We have to wait for my mom.Sensei!
Misako::: I can't hold on...
Wu::: Misako, hang on! 
Misako::: ...much longer. 
Wu::: I have you now.This way. There's no place to hide. We have to fight. Do you still know Spinjitzu?
Misako::: Do you forget you never beat me?
Wu::: I confess, I wasn't really trying.
Misako::: Neither was I.
Wu::: Ninja, go! 
Zane::: Nya, descend. Do it now!
Wu::: I'm glad we go together. 
Misako::: Then let's go. 
Wu::: What? 
Misako:::The past is past, remember?
Wu::: But there's always the future. 
Garmadon::: Garmadon is back, baby! Garmadon is back!
