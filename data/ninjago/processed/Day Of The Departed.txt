Kai:::Move, move, move. We're running out of time. Pick up the pace.
Cole::: Yes, ninja. It's up to us to save the day...again.
Nya::: Roger that, Kai. Zane, do you have a read?
Zane::: ETA too late, unless we break all speed limits. Increase velocity.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Already on it.
Wu:::Ninja, I have reached the rendezvous point. Where are you?
Lloyd::: The museum is still 5 clicks away. We're on our way.
Jay:::Look out, kids. Jay to save the day. Hey, race you there, Lloyd.
Lloyd::: I still don't understand how you got the Supersonic Raider Jet.
Jay::: Uh, because I called dibs. Guy who calls dibs first gets it, right, Cole?Right, Cole? Cole?! Let me go get him! He's drifting off again! 
Cole:::No. No. Come back. Come... No. 
Jay::: Cole! Look out!
Cole::: Oh. Uh. Oh.S-sorry, Jay.
Jay::: Whew. I know you're a ghost, but I'm still in the living world, and I'd kinda like to keep it that way.
Wu::: Ninja, time is of the essence.
Cole::: He's right. Engage.
Lloyd::: We have one last shot if we wanna make it. Combine for maximum impact.
Kai:::Locked.
Nya:::Loaded.
Jay:::And jet speed, reporting for duty sir.
Lloyd::: Fire all engines.
Jay:::Master Wu, are we too late?
Wu::: There may yet be time. 
Ninja::: Ninja, go.
Jay:::Mission accomplished.
Lloyd::: Yeah, good thing we got to the gift shop before it closed.
Zane::: Yes, a Day of the Departed celebration is incomplete without a Day of the Departed lantern.
Nya::: Oh, this is my favorite holiday. I love all the lights.
Kai::: And the costumes. 
Jay::: And the candy. Hit me, kid.
Jay::: Mmm. Best day of the year.
Wu::: Yes, enjoy the fun and festivities, but never lose sight of the true meaning of the Day of the Departed. Today is about remembrance. We light lanterns to remember our ancestors, and to settle our debts.
Jay::: Yeah, got it, got it. Lanterns, ancestors, debts, but candy too, right?
Dr. Saunders::: The ninja. The Master Wu.
Wu::: Dr. Saunders.
Saunders::: Oh, please. We are all friends. You must call me by my first name, yes? Sander, yes?
Kai:::Dr. Sander Saunders?
Saunders::: At your service.I am so pleased to be seeing you at this now. We are opening our new exhibit. Come. You see, come.Might I be presenting the Hall of Villainy.
All::: Wow.
Saunders::: Cryptor.
Zane::: A plastic mannequin.
Saunders::: Kozu.
Lloyd::: Uncanny.
Saunders::: Chen.
Nya::: Memories.
Saunders::: Samukai.
Jay::: Is he looking at me?
Wu::: Maybe from the past.
Saunders::: And Morro. Checking this out! We don't just open on Day of Departed. It's Day of Departed lunar eclipse. A special eclipse.
Wu::: The rarest Yin-Yang eclipse.
Saunders::: Oh, poetic, is it not? Scary holiday, scary exhibit, scary moon,There is magic in the air.Boogily-boogily!
Kai:::It's... every villain we've ever faced.
Cole:::Not every villain.
Saunders::: No, there are many more to unpack. Overlord, Golden Master. All the ones who tried to destroy you. Exciting.
Jay::: Uh... yeah, exciting.
Saunders::: As we proceed further on the tour you can...
Cole:::"Although known to some as the master without a student, Kodokuna Yang will be remembered by most as the creator of Airjitzu, the most powerful martial art in history." Huh. Actually, I remember Yang as the guy who turned me into a ghost.Hey, uh, Dr. Saunders? What's the story on this thing?Hello? Dr. Saunders? Anyone?
Nya::: Look at that. Cool.
Saunders::: Ah, you have a good eye, Nya.
Cole::: Her? I'm the one who spotted... Uh, hey, watch it. You guys are walking right through me!
Saunders:::The dark magic.
Cole::: They don't hear me, o-or see me. It's like I don't exist anymore. And it's all your fault! 
Yang::: Cole. Come. Come.
Cole:::Uh....tell me you heard that.
Yang::: Come, Cole…
Saunders::: ...which is why it is sealed in this case made of Clearstone, the hardest substance known to human. Impenetrable by any living being.
Yang::: Cole.
Cole::: Yang.
Yang::: Close the circle.
Cole::: Close the circle?
Yang::: Close the circle...
Cole::: Close the circle.
Cole:::Huh. 
Wu::: Thank you so much for such an informative tour, Dr. Saunders.ninja, at the eclipse's peak we will return here, for the concert. But first, we must go forth and honor those we have lost. Those who have departed.
Cole::: They don't realize I'm gone. Maybe...I'm departed. 
Kai::: See you guys soon.
Nya::: Happy Day of the Departed, everyone.
Wu:::We honor our ancestors. Because if we never look to the past, we cannot envision the future.On the Day of the Departed, we pause to remember those we've lost.And enjoy our time with those we are still fortunate to have.I raise this cup of remembrance tea to you, Father. We never forget.
Lou::: Cole. Cole, where are you? My son was gonna meet me before the show to light a lantern. 
Royal Blacksmiths::: Gave you your voice. Gave you your song. Put music in your heart. Now my heart is gone. To pieces. Pieces, pieces. Pieces, pieces. 
Dareth::: Hey, guys? Hey, listen.Guys? Guys. Guys! Stop it!Ah, kids. Always letting you down. That's why I don't have 'em. Not cause Gayle keeps turning down my marriage proposals, even though I'd make an excellent provider. Ahem, anyway. It's a good thing your manager is here to help you focus on the important things.
Lou::: What's more important than family?
Dareth::: A paying gig for a festival audience.Have a good show, boys.Hello, Ninjago. Hey, look at you. Look at that once-in-a-lifetime lunar eclipse. It's really happening. How about a warm Day of the Departed greeting for the Royal Blacksmiths! 
Royal Blacksmiths::: Be my Day of the Departed baby. Cold and spooky-hearted love. Still, my love for her is off the chart-ed.
Ronin:::Everyone's here, so no one's home. Time for a little scrap-hunting. 
Cole::: All right, Yang. Show yourself. You hear me? Show yourself.
Yang::: You received my message.
Cole::: I got it, all right. And I've got one for you. It's direct from the business end of your own weapon. 
Yang:::The Yin Blade. But how? It's encased in solid Clearstone. That case is impenetrable.
Cole::: Not to a ghost. Which, thanks to you, I still am.
Yang::: What are you going to do?
Cole::: There's magic in the air. You know, eclipse and all?
Yang::: Please, where is your holiday spirit? It's the Day of the Departed.
Cole::: Uh-huh. And I'm settling my debt.What? What's so funny?
Yang::: This. That. All of it.
Cole::: What's happening?
Yang::: My plan.You never should have played with dark magic, boy. This Day of the Departed will be remembered as my Night of the Return. The Yin Blade, if you please.
Cole::: Yeah, I don't think so.
Yang::: I do.
Cole:::What? 
Morro::: Huh?
Samukai::: Who-Who are you?
Morro::: I should ask you the same thing.
Samukai::: I am Samukai, Skulkin general, fearsome master of the ax.
Kozu::: Ha! Fearsome? You call that fearsome?This is fearsome! I am Kozu, destroyer of all foolish enough to challenge me.
Cryptor::: Yeah, so how did you do against a guy who destroyed you?
Chen::: But what has brought us back? Oh! Buttons, buttons, buttons!Oh. Brake? No. Brake? No!I'm all right!Still all right.
Samukai::: What is going on here?
Cryptor::: Well, the skinny man in the silky girl robes can't control his chair. And—
Samukai::: No, I mean with us.
Morro:::Perhaps he can explain.
Chen::: Still all right.
Yang:::My magic has brought you back from the Departed Realm to Ninjago, but you can only remain for the duration of the eclipse. Unless...
Chen::: Unless?
Yang::: Unless you destroy the ninja who destroyed you. Use your Departed Blades, and you will take their place among the living.
Pythor:::Hall of Villainy? More like, Hall of Empty-ny.Oh. Nice. 
Yang::: The ninja are dispersed around Ninjago, and you will have revenge. 
Pythor::: Did someone say revenge? I want in. Ah, Cryptor, my loyal friend.Chen.
Chen::: Pythor.
Kozu::: Oh, frosty.
Yang::: You must each choose a ninja and—
Samukai::: I call Zane.
Cryptor::: No! He's my clone.
Pythor::: Technically, you're his clone.
Chen::: The Blacksmith's brats are mine.
Pythor::: How come you get two?
Yang::: Silence! Time is wasting, and I've got my own thing going on. So work it out! 
Chen::: I have a score to settle with Nya, so she's mine. Her brother too.
Pythor::: Lloyd, I destroyed the father. Well, more or less. It's finally time to destroy the son.
Cryptor::: I'll take Zane.
Morro::: Master Wu. We left things...unfinished. I will settle our debt, once and for all.
Samukai:::That only leaves Jay. One ninja, but two of us. Okay, rock, paper, scissors. One, two, three. One, two, three.It doesn't seem to work.
Kozu:::I want him.
Samukai::: Yes.
Pythor::: Then it's settled. Although, the ninja won't go easily. Perhaps we could use some help?
Cryptor:::The Hall of Sidekicks.
Pythor:::Convenient, is it not?
Cole::: So guys, what say you help me out? You know, student-to-ninja? Hello? Look, I know Yang's your master, but how can you be on his side?
Yang::: Your pleas are useless. My students, well, they're loyal to no one but me.
Cole::: Come on, guys. Yang is like the definition of evil.
Yang::: Actually, "Yang" means "good". But I always did aspire for great. I dedicated my life to the study of the martial arts. I mastered them all, and even created my own. Airjitzu was my first achievement, but it was nothing compared to what I would discover next. My research revealed the location of the Yin Blade, a weapon whose magic was so powerful, it was said to hold the key to eternal life. Control that magic and I'd be forever remembered as Ninjago's greatest master. Immortality was so near. It was time for the ultimate test... myself. But something went...wrong. So while I will live forever, it is only as a ghost. Cursed to haunt this once-proud temple as Master of the House. Never able to return. Until tonight, thanks to you.
Cole::: Thanks to me? How?
Yang::: You said it yourself. There's magic in the air. On the Day of the Departed, when there's a Yin-Yang lunar eclipse, the Yin Blade can cut the Rift of Return. So thank you for this.
Cole::: You're not welcome. And you won't get away with it. I'm supposed to meet my friends soon. When they see I'm missing, they'll come for me.
Yang::: See you're missing? Ha! Look at you. You can barely see yourself.Besides, you've caused quite a few problems for your friends.
Nya::: It feels strange being back in our parents' shop after all this time.
Kai::: Nya? Do you think we'll ever find out what actually happened to them?
Chen::: I could tell you. But you have bigger things to worry about.
Nya::: Chen?
Kai:::I don't know how you're back, but it's two against one.
Chen::: Is it?Nope. Hmm. Uh, almost. Ah. Found it. Yes.Doodle pep, ninja.
Cryptor::: Oops. Did I hurt your dear old dad? Or should I say our dad?
Ed::: Uh, Edna, dear, is that crumb cake ready? Jay's starving.
Jay::: I'm fine, Dad.
Ed::: I know, son, but I love your mother's crumb cake.
Samukai:::Guess who's back?
Lloyd::: I know Dad's gone, but sometimes it's like he's still with me.Pythor?
Pythor::: When we last met, I decided to help you and your father, Garmadon, defeat Chen. Do you remember why?
Lloyd::: You said something about how if anyone was going to take over the world, you'd rather it be you.
Pythor::: Precisely. Time to finish the job.
Wu::: An eclipse is always an omen, but is this one a sign of good...or bad?
Morro:::Bad. Very bad.
Cole::: My friends. What have you done?
Yang::: No, Cole, what have you done?
Cole::: How? How could I steal the Yin Blade and release all those ghosts?
Yang::: You were scared you were departing and that your friends had forgotten you. So I took advantage of your fragile mental state to trick you. Oh, oh, you weren't literally asking, were you? Give up, Cole. You're by yourself. There's no one to help you. Now, excuse me, I have a rift to open. Watch him, just in case. 
Cole::: All by myself. Hm.
Misako::: Pythor, what are you doing?
Pythor::: Giving the kid a one-way ticket to join his daddy.
Lloyd::: Sorry, I don't really feel like going on a vacation.
Pythor::: But it's a holiday. Respect your elders. 
Misako::: Lloyd! 
Chen::: Who designed this thing?
Kai::: Raider bikes. 
Chen:::Oh, good. Better. Best. 
Cryptor::: Escape is futile, Zane. You and I share programming. I know your every move before you even make it.
Zane::: Even this one? 
Cryptor::: If you know it, I know it. Enjoy the Departed Realm. And say hi to dear old Dad.
Wu::: Well, my former student. How have you returned, Morro?
Morro::: The question is not how, but why.
Cole::: So I didn't get your name.Okay, I'll just call you "Chuck." Look, Chuck, I know you think you're Yang's student, and maybe you were once, but now you're his prisoner. Don't you see? He's not your friend. He's your captor. You gotta shake off his spell. Then, we can stop him. Together. You and me.Okay, no pressure, but you have three seconds to decide. One, two, three.Guess I'm working solo, Chuck.
Ed::: Don't you worry, Edna. I'll take care of those piles of bones.
Edna::: Oh, now, Ed, be careful. Dr. Berkman says not to strain.
Jay::: I got this, Dad. Lightning!I have no idea what you want with my parents.
Samukai::: It's not your parents I want, Jay. It's you! 
Ed::: Feisty. He's his mother's son. 
Samukai::: Fools. Don't just stand there. Grab them. Then he won't fight me.
Jay::: No!
Samukai::: Oh, yes! 
Royal Blacksmiths::: Be mine. Day of the Departed baby. Cold and spooky-hearted love.
Dareth::: Royal Blacksmiths, everybody. Aren't they fantastic? Hey, speaking of fantastic, it's my duty as manager to remind you that there's fantastic merch available in the gift shop. Hats, CDs, mugs. Show you're a real fan. Now, before my boys continue, I just want to say thank you for coming and getting into the spirit of the night. Look at those costumes. Funny clowns and aliens and astronauts. Wow, those Stone Warriors.So realistic.
Kozu::: Revenge will be mine!
Dareth::: Well, normally my guys don't take requests, but it is a special occasion. Boys?
Royal Blacksmiths::: Revenge Will Be Mine. And you know I'm feeling fine. 'Cause my girl's coming. 
Dareth::: Hey, that's no costume.Can we at least talk about it?
Kozu::: Revenge!
Dareth::: Okay, we're talking. 
Kozu::: Destruction!
Dareth::: Talking is good!
Kozu::: Crazy!
Cole::: Yes! No.Hey. So any chance you wanna tell me where Yang is opening that rift?So...that's a no? Whoa, let's not be hasty. This isn't a fair fight. I'm handcuffed.Ah! Oh. So you might want a few more guys.Okay, sports fans, the score is Cole: 3, evil possessed students: 0.
Yang::: Hurry up. I haven't got 3000 years. 
Cole::: Okay, Cole, it's showtime.
Yang::: Deal with him.
Cole:::Maybe I can do this myself. Whew! I'm coming for you, Yang. It's over. You don't have any more students. You're all alone.
Yang::: Oh, I am not alone. Not at all. 
Cole::: What's the matter, Yang? Too afraid to take me on by yourself?
Yang::: Too busy. The eclipse is beginning to fade, Cole. Just like you. Take him. 
Wu::: We have fought twice before. And although it pains me, I will do so again if I must.
Morro::: No, you misunderstand. I'm not here to fight you. I'm here to warn you. Master Yang has put your team in terrible danger.
Wu::: What has Yang done?
Morro::: He's made you forget one of your own, one who was already slipping away.
Wu::: Tell me more.
Morro::: I will, but aboard the Bounty. We have to warn the others.
Nya::: Duck! 
Kai::: This is my stop. Ninja, go! 
Lloyd::: Can't...hold...on.
Misako::: Yes, you can.
Pythor::: Fool! You continually underestimate me. You're so like your father.
Misako::: He's right, Lloyd. You're brave and noble and—
Lloyd::: And a master of Spinjitzu. You are still with me, Dad. Ninja, go! 
Yang::: Good to see you, rare eclipse. Now help me to finally open up the rift.
Cole::: All right, guys, time to take a break. Or not. 
Yang::: Open the rift. Set me free.
Cole::: Okay, okay, how about that break?You guys are more tiresome than Jay!
Yang::: Yes. It is working.
Samukai::: For what it's worth, this isn't personal, Jay.
Jay::: It kind of feels like it is, Samukai.
Samukai::: It's only so I can return. I promise that as soon as this is over, I'll release your parents.
Ronin::: I'm on that one. 
Jay::: Ronin. Thanks for coming.
Ronin::: Yeah, I came to help. I definitely didn't think your folks would be at the concert so I could, um...borrow...some free scrap metal for my mech.
Jay::: What?
Ronin::: Um, nothing. You're all clear, kid. Finish them.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Zane, they have flight capability. It appears you have miscalculated.
Zane::: No, I didn't. 
Dareth::: Helmet of Shadows, where are you? You control the Stone Warriors, so I can control the Stone Warriors. 
Yang::: Ah, here it comes.
Cole::: Ugh, they just keep coming. I can't do this much longer. One last time. Ninja, go! 
Chen::: Fair fight. I win.Unfair. 
Jay::: Old foe, new trick. Watch me, Samukai. 
Cryptor::: I know your every move. I know how you hit. I know how you will kick. And I know you never give up.
Zane::: Then I give up. 
Misako::: Time for you to call it quits.
Pythor::: No, just time for a spectacular exit. 
Lloyd::: Think he's gone for good?
Misako::: I hope so, but Pythor is as much cat as he is snake. He has nine lives.
Pythor:::Next time I'll take my own advice and bring some sidekicks.
Jay::: Mm. Mm. Great crumb cake, Mom.
Ronin::: Happy Day of the Departed, guys. Oh, and thank you for the bag of scrap.
Ed::: All you had to do was ask.
Dareth::: Helmet of Shadows. I found it. Security, eighty-six this guy.
Kozu:::No, no. Release me.
Saunders::: My museum! What have you done?
Dareth:::Sorry.
Cole::: Don't make me hurt you too.Stop it, Yang.
Yang::: Freedom. Return. It's all mine.
Cole::: No! You...are not going...anywhere! 
Jay::: Guys, I have the ghost story to end all ghost stories. You will never guess what just happened.
Kai::: You battled the possessed mannequin of a mortal enemy?
Nya::: Him and his goons tried to send you to the Departed Realm with magic blades?
Zane::: But you defeated them first.
Lloyd::: And saw their ghosts disappear into the night.
Jay::: Oh, okay, fine. You guessed. Well, since you know so much, why were all those ghosts out here?
Wu:::Because distracting you was part of Master Yang's plan.
Morro::: And he had help.
Lloyd:::Morro.
Jay::: Any other villains want to show up tonight?
Kai::: We've stopped five, what's one more?
Wu::: No. Put away your weapons. He's here to help. Morro, tell them.
Morro::: Yang tricked Cole into helping him open a rift to return to Ninjago.
Jay::: Cole? How'd he trick you?
Zane::: Jay, Cole isn't here.
Jay::: Are you sure? He's been fading a lot lately. He's kind of easy to miss.
All ninja:::We forgot Cole!
Wu::: To the Bounty. They must be at the Temple of the Airjitzu Master. Thank you, Morro.
Morro::: Happy Day of the Departed, Master.
Yang::: Just give up already.
Cole::: No. I'm keeping you here until the eclipse ends and the rift closes. Your evil will never return to Ninjago. 
Yang::: What are you even fighting for? Your friends have abandoned you.Your master has abandoned you. You are all alone.
Cole::: No!Can't...go on...alone.
Yang::: Yes. Yield. Soon I will be gone, but you will remain forever Departed, destined to haunt this temple forever as the new Master of the House. 
Cole::: I'm...fading away.
Yang::: Just one more lonely ghost. Not a friend in the world.
Nya::: Cole!
Cole::: Huh?
Yang::: What? Who's that?
Cole::: My friends.Ghost or not, I'm gonna do what I came here to do, Yang.
Kai::: We have to help him.
Nya::: I can't bring it any closer. The wind's still too strong.
Cole::: And you're wrong. I'm not the one who's alone. You are.
Yang::: No. I have my family. 
Cole::: No, you have prisoners. That's not family. That's captivity.Whoa, I feel...different. Like, like, I can punch through...anything. 
Yang::: No. No! You broke my spell!
Cole::: The rift! If you hurry, you can be free of this place forever! 
Wu::: The rift is almost closed.
Yang::: My...my students. Leaving me. I...I failed.
Cole::: Yeah, you did.
Yang::: I always fail.
Cole::: Yeah, you—Wait, what?
Yang::: I dedicated my life to studying the martial arts. Alone. I got arrogant, I wanted to live forever.
Cole::: Why? No one lives forever.
Yang::: Because I knew the day I was gone, no one would remember me.
Cole::: All of this was so you wouldn't be forgotten?
Jay::: What is he doing? Is-is he talking to Yang?
Wu::: The rift cannot be opened again until the next Yin-Yang eclipse.
Zane::: Which, according to my calculations, won't happen for 3,721 years.
Kai::: Cole, the rift! You gotta pass through the rift!
Yang::: You must think I'm a fool for having such a petty desire.
Cole::: No, I get it. Believe me, I get it. I know what it's like to feel forgotten. Alone. It-it hurts. But Master Yang, you are already gonna be remembered forever.
Yang::: Me? How?
Cole::: You created Airjitzu.
Jay::: Cole! It's now or never!
Cole::: Now come on, there's still time to go through. Both of us.
Yang::: No, I'm afraid that's impossible. The curse of the Temple requires that at least one ghost remained behind as Master of the House.
Cole::: One of us has to stay here?
Yang::: It must be this way.
Cole::: Hey! What are you doing?
Yang::: Settling my debt. 
Wu::: Brace yourselves. It's going to be a hard landing. 
Misako::: Is everyone all right?
Zane::: Nothing that tightening a few screws can't fix.
Lloyd::: I'm okay, but where's Cole?
Jay::: Oh, no!
Nya::: Did he make it?
Jay::: He was too late. He's gone forever. I'd give anything to have him back.
Cole:::Anything?
Jay::: Anything.
Cole:::Even the Sonic Raider Jet?
All ninja::: Cole! 
Jay::: You're back!
Lloyd::: You're not a ghost anymore.
Nya::: You look good as new.
Cole::: Ah. Pretty much. Thank you, Nya.
Kai::: Speaking of good as new...
Wu:::The Temple of the Airjitzu Master has been returned to its original condition.
Zane::: It's beautiful.
Cole::: You know, that would be a pretty cool place for a ninja to train.
Cole::: Whoa. And was I right or was I right?
Jay:::Yes, you were right. Are you going to retell this story every Day of the Departed from now on?
Cole::: Only until you admit that you didn't want to move in because you were scared it's still haunted. 
Jay::: I wasn't scared. I was cautious. Okay fine, I was scared. And wrong. There's no more ghosts here.
Cole::: Nope. No ghosts. 
Wu:::Happy Day of the Departed.
