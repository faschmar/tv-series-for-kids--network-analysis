Wu::: Right on time.
Acronix::: What? 
Wu::: Long time, no see.
Acronix::: Master Wu? You look...old. As if your best days have passed. Not unlike your monastery.
Wu:::I still have plenty of days left.Shall we finish what we started? I've been waiting decades.
Acronix::: Really?It doesn't feel that long to me.
Wu::: This ends now.
Jay::: This ends now, Samukai. Nope, pretending this is the actual Samukai doesn't make cleaning up the museum any more interesting. This is so lame. We're ninja, not janitors.
Jay::: Yeah, and whose fault is that, Cole?
Cole:::Okay. How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry for accidentally unleashing the ghostly forces of evil that attacked Ninjago? 
Jay:::How high can you count?
Jay::: Eh, speaking of which, you're still not used to having your old, non-ghost hands back? 
Cole:::Oh, I'm working on it.
Nya::: This is exhausting.If I could go back in time, I'd tell Dr. Saunders we were too busy to help.
Nya::: It's just an expression, Zane. 
Kai::: I... I don't believe it.
Nya::: What is that?
Kai::: I think it's a portrait of... our parents.
Nya:::Whoa. This dates to when I was, like, 3 years old.
Kai::: Shortly before they disappeared. We know so little about them, Nya.
Nya::: Father was the Elemental Master of Fire. Mother was the Master of Water. 
Kai::: And they left us the old blacksmith shop and little else.
Nya::: They left us our powers.
Cole::: Guys, look what I found!
Jay::: Uh, isn't that Garmadon?
Cole::: It is.Lloyd, that's your dad.
Kai::: And there's Master Wu.
Nya::: He looks so...young.
Lloyd::: Look at them, my father and my uncle, Ninjago's two greatest Elemental Masters. I wonder if I'll ever live up to their legacy.
Jay::: First Kai and Nya, now Lloyd. It's family picture day at the museum.
Cole::: Does anyone recognize this battle?
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L., analyse.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Facial contour mapping indicates this scene takes place forty years ago during the Serpentine Wars.
Cole::: During the Serpentine Wars? But Ninjago was at peace. Who would they be fighting?
Sander:::Refreshing time. Hot, sweaty work deserves a cool drink.
Kai:::Ah, thank, Dr. Saunders. 
Sander::: Enjoy the pickled beet tea.
Cole::: Uh...Oops! Hehe. New hands. So clumsy.
Jay::: Eh.Mmm.
Lloyd:::What's this painting? 
Sander::: Oh, this? Nothing. Minor skirmish. No historical significance. That is why I don't hang it in the main gallery.
Jay:::It looks pretty significant to me. This thing is huge.
Sander::: Yes, a huge myth. The folklores.
Zane:::Even if it is a myth, who are these men Masters Wu and Garmadon are supposed to be fighting? I have no data on them.
Sander:::There is a legend.Twin brothers called the Hands of Time.
Kai::: The Hands of Time?
Sander::: They could allegedly manipulate time itself. Speed it up, slow it down. All sorts of things.See what I mean? Manipulate time? A ridiculous fairy tale. 
Nya::: Who's this one? 
Sander::: Oh, this handsome-looking fella? Ha! The legend says his name is Krux.
Lloyd::: And who is the nasty-looking guy? 
Sander::: In the stories, he's called Acronix.
Acronix:::You might as well give up, Wu. I'm the superior fighter. And your brother isn't here to bail you out.
Wu ::: No. But neither is yours, Acronix.
Acronix::: And whose fault is that?
Wu::: Garmadon and I did what we had to do to protect Ninjago.
Acronix::: And I will do what I have to do. 
Acronix::: Huh. More spry than I would expect. Let's see if you can keep up.
Ronin::: Where do you want this last one, Misako? 
Misako::: Anywhere you can find room.Ronin, Dareth, thank you again for helping me set up our new ninja temple.
Dareth:::Happy to do it.
Ronin::: Do what? Three hundred boxes airlifted into this place and you didn't carry a single one of them.
Dareth::: I told you, I got a bad back. Besides, this unpacking isn't gonna supervise itself. 
Misako::: Oh! This came to the wrong place.
Dareth::: Sweet sword fighter, get a load of that thing.
Misako::: Nya's samurai suit. This should have gone to her Samurai X Cave.
Ronin::: What for? I thought she gave up being Samurai X for the Water Ninja.
Misako:::Mm, she did. But she kept the mech so I'm sure she'd want this too. If nothing else, it's a souvenir of a past life.
Ronin::: If it were me, I'd sell the whole kit and caboodle online. One of a kind tech like that? Some collector would pay a fortune. With that kind of cheese, she could buy all the souvenirs she ever wanted. Fill the place with snow globes. Uh, tell Nya I'd be happy to broker a deal. For a small fee, of course.
Dareth::: Sell it? This baby belongs in a museum...or my dojo.Look out, Ninjago, here comes Samurai D.
Misako::: Uh...
Ronin::: Huh?
Dareth ::: Samurai D.The D is for Dareth.
Acronix:::Give it up, old man. I've got decades on you. I'm faster, stronger.
Wu::: That's your mistake. You assume your youth is a greater weapon than my experience.
Wu::: Arrogant to the finish. Just like your brother.
Acronix::: Arrogant? No...confident! 
Wu::: Arrogant, it was Krux's downfall. And now it's yours. Do you yield?
Acronix::: Never.
Wu::: There's no escape this time, Acronix.Do. You. Yield?
Acronix::: I...yield.
Wu::: So forty years after it began,the battle of the Elemental Masters versus the Hands of Time finally ended at precisely 6 p.m. 
Misako::: Dareth, please give me that back.
Ronin::: Oh, allow—
Dareth::: Oh! Oh, my back! My back!
Ronin::: —me? When did I get on top of Dareth?
Kai::: 6 p.m. Quitting time.
Lloyd::: What just happened? Time just...
Kai::: Moved forward?
Acronix::: And at 6:01, the battle began again.
Misako::: How did I get this? I have the strangest feeling. It's like déjà vu, but in reverse.
Ronin::: It's like time skipped a beat.
Misako:::No, it skipped an entire minute.
Dareth:::Please get off of me!
Cole::: Um, weren't we just outside? When did we get here?
Nya::: How did we get here?
Zane::: My circuits are picking up an energy displacement.
Kai::: There was a displacement all right. It displaced us right in here.
Lloyd::: What is going on?
Jay:::I don't know. But it's loud!
Acronix::: You had your chance, old man. You should have let me drop. Now, let's see if your experience is more powerful than...the Time Blade.
Nya::: These energy readings are off the charts. Where is it coming from?
Zane::: I'm trying to pinpoint the location.
Jay:::How about pinpointing the location of the off button? These alarms are giving me a......headache.Thank you.
Zane::: Hm. This is surprising.
Jay::: No, it's not. I've always had sensitive ears and—
Zane::: I meant, I think I know how we suddenly appeared on the Destiny's Bounty.
Cole::: How?
Zane::: The displacement we experienced was not caused by just any normal energy. It was temporal energy.
Jay::: Oh, well, temporal energy. Of course. Everyone knows that's, um...powerful.
Kai::: You have no idea what "temporal" means, do you?
Jay::: I do not.
Lloyd::: It means "time."
Zane::: Precisely. Whatever created that displacement can warp the very fabric of space-time.
Jay::: Which is powerful, right?
Zane::: Very. All the normal rules of existence no longer apply to such a force.
Jay::: Told you it was powerful.
Acronix::: That's right, flee, Master Wu!"Master." Ha. To think my brother and I ever took orders from you!Weak! Afraid! Lacking any ambition!
Wu::: Your only ambition was to rule.
Acronix::: Because Krux and I deserved to rule! Do you recall what we said, on this very ground, forty years ago?
Wu::: "Control time...""...control everything."
Acronix::: Excellent memory, old man. And look who controls time again.Just need a moment for my Time Blade to recharge.
Acronix::: Gone?
Wu::: It ends now, Acronix.
Acronix::: It certainly does.
Acronix::: No, no, no, I'm not there now.That's where I was then. 
Acronix::: You know what that means. I'll see you in just...a moment!
Acronix::: "Control time, control everything!"
Jay:::Okay, yes, there was a little hiccup in time. But just one. I'm sure it was nothing. They probably happen all the time, and we don't realize it. You know, like déjà vu. Can we go home now?Seriously, we just cleaned up an entire museum! Aren't you guys tired?
Zane::: Well...
Nya::: Well?
P.I.X.A.L.::: I've located the surge's epicentre.
Zane::: Where, P.I.X.A.L.?
P.I.X.A.L.::: The old monastery.
Cole::: The monastery? That place totally burned down. Why would anyone or anything be up there?
Lloyd::: We should find out.
Jay::: Oh, why? Cole's right, there's no reason for anyone to be up at the monastery. Zane's probably malfunctioning.
Zane::: Self-diagnostic indicates negative.
Jay:::How about now?
Zane::: No.
Kai::: I agree with Lloyd. We should go. Where there's smoke, there's usually fire.
Nya::: And where there's massive energy displacement, there's usually trouble.
Jay::: Well, maybe it's, like, you know, a harmless massive energy displacement.Come on. Seriously, I'm exhausted. We did our good deed for the day.
Lloyd::: Wait. Master Wu said he was going to the monastery. Something about "finishing an old fight." He said this was something he should do alone.
Jay:::What are you waiting for? Get us to the monastery!
Acronix::: Ugh. Ouch. That last hit hurt, didn't it? The blade gives it a little extra kick. I think I'm going to call that one the "Time Punch." And its effects are devastating.
Wu::: I...I made a mistake.
Acronix::: Yes, you did. You never should have challenged me. Not forty years ago, not today. Don't worry, I can be merciful. I figure one more charge, one more Time Punch, and it'll all be over fast.Oh, how I wish my brother were here to see this.
Wu::: Me too. Ninja, go! 
Acronix::: Hm! You know what they say. If the Time Punch doesn't get you, the fall will. Actually, no one says that. But they should. Farewell.I'd like to stay to the end, but I have somewhere to be.I don't believe it. The legendary Destiny's Bounty. But what is a two-hundred-year-old flying pirate ship doing here? Now? This has been a strange day.
Lloyd::: Hey. Has anyone seen Master Wu?
Jay::: Hm. I only see that guy. 
Cole::: Who's that?
Jay::: I don't know. Let's find out.
Lloyd::: No, no, wait, what if...?Hey, Jay.
Jay:::Ahem. Excuse me, I'm looking for someone.
Acronix::: That's no pirate.
Lloyd::: What's he doing?
Acronix::: Who do you seek, ninja?
Jay::: Spinjitzu Master. About yay tall, long beard, goes by the name Wu.
Acronix::: Haven't seen him.
Jay::: Hm.That's odd. 'Cause judging by all the slash marks around here, I think you have. 
Lloyd::: Jay just pulled his nunchucks. Nya, you'd better get us down there fast.
Nya::: Not gonna work. There's not enough room down there.
Cole::: It's just one guy. I'm sure Jay can handle...uh, whoever that is.
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L....
P.I.X.A.L.::: Scanning.It appears to be...
Zane:::Acronix!
Cole::: Acronix? As in Acronix and Krux? The Hands of Time?
Kai::: From the painting? But Dr. Saunders says the battle wasn't real.
Lloyd::: Even if it was, it was forty years ago. Acronix would be an old man today, like Master Wu. But that guy down there is young.
Nya::: But that's impossible. Unless...he time-traveled?
Zane::: We have to get down there. Now!
Acronix:::A moment ago, I had no quarrel with you. Unfortunately for you, I do now. 
Lloyd::: Did you see that? It's like...
Kai::: He jumped forward in time.
Cole:::Yeah? Let's see him jump this! 
Acronix::: More ninja?Curious.
All except Acronix::: Ninja, go!
Acronix::: You only missed me by a few seconds.
Nya::: Sometimes I wish I was still Samurai X instead of a ninja.
Kai::: You're fast.But faster than this?
Acronix:::Elemental Master of Fire. I've encountered one of you before.
Kai::: Huh? You met my father?
Nya::: There he is!
Acronix::: Ninja...Come out and play.
Lloyd::: Jay, Cole, Kai, we get Acronix. Zane, Nya, use your Elemental Powers to put out this fire.
Acronix::: Ninja...Come out and play.
Jay::: Hang on. Who put you in charge? Why can't I help with the flames?
Lloyd::: You think lightning is better than water and ice for stopping flames?
Jay::: Good point. Let's go! 
Cole:::You got lucky last time.
Acronix::: Clumsy. Like a fawn standing on her new legs.
Jay:::One!
Kai:::Two!
Lloyd:::Three! 
Lloyd::: Yes. Keep moving him back. He's gonna have to surrender, or else the flames are gonna get him.
Acronix::: Here's Acronix!
Kai::: It's gonna blow!
Jay:::Ah. Burned down again. Man, this place just cannot catch a break.
Lloyd::: Neither did Acronix.
Kai:::Good, you know me, I don't back down from a challenge, but I wouldn't want to face that guy again.
Cole:::No way.He moved at, like, the speed of time.
Lloyd:::Come on, guys, let's get back to the Destiny's Bounty.
Nya:::But what about Master Wu?
Lloyd:::We gotta find him. Spread out! 
Cole:::Gotta...hang...on.Barely made it. 
Zane::: Master, are you alright?
Wu::: I...fear not.
Zane::: Why was Acronix here?
Kai::: How did he do that?
Jay::: Why were you fighting him?
Wu::: There is much to tell you. And not much time.
Dr. Saunders::: Where have you been?
Acronix::: Sorry I'm late. Ninja trouble.Things have changed since I was last in Ninjago.
Krux:::Indeed they have...brother.
