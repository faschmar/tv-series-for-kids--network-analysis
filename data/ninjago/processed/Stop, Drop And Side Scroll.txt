Lloyd::: Our friends wouldn't want us to give up. We have to keep going.
Jay::: We'll find a way. Somehow. We're going to find them, and bring them all back.
Nya::: Okay, what's next?
Jay::: Key-Tana is.
Lloyd::: It looks a little...intense.We must be getting close to the end of the game.
Jay::: Well, c'ya on the other side.
Jay::: Holy cow! Unagami's Temple of Madness.
Nya::: I'd go mad too if I lived here.
Jay::: Okay, that's freaky!
Lloyd::: We should head back. Let's go about the dangers, and come back with a plan.Did you guys feel that?
Jay::: Feel what?
Lloyd::: I don't know. I thought I felt something.Whoa!
Nya::: Hey!
Lloyd::: W-what's happening?Where's that music coming from?
Jay::: Oh, man. I was afraid of this. We've entered the world of old school platform games!
Nya::: And those games force you to run towards chaos?
Jay::: Eh, technically side-scroll toward chaos, but yeah.
Jay::: There's rules to these games. One: You can't go backwards.Two: Everything speeds up the further you go!Three: All of the obstacles are pre-programmed, so if you learn the timing, you can evade the danger.But the most important thing to know is: If you die, we have to start over at the beginning!
Nya::: Wait, what do you mean we start-OOF! Okay, I see what you mean.
Lloyd::: We have to do all that over again?!
Nya::: All of us?! How's that fair?
Jay::: If we pay attention, we won't make the same mistakes twice.Oh yeah!Mhmm! Mhmm!Haha!AHH! 
Lloyd::: Okay, I'm getting a little tired of this.
Nya::: We don't have many lives left so be careful, okay?
Lloyd::: Okay, I'm down to my last life.
Nya::: Me too.
Jay::: Same here. No more mistakes.
Lloyd::: Ha! No more scrolling! Did we beat the level?
Nya::: I don't see the Key-Tana.
Jay::: Uh oh! The music always gets faster when the game's about to get harder!
Nya::: How could it possibly get harder?!
Jay::: Oh, an infinity maze!
Lloyd::: Let's hope not. Infinity means forever.
Nya::: Is someone throwing bricks at us?
Lloyd::: Those aren't bricks, they're bombs!
Jay::: Whoa! Agh!What are those?! 
Lloyd::: Gah!
Nya::: Whoa!
Jay::: Ah! AAAH!
Nya::: And apparently the floor can just burst into flames!
Jay::: Ugh. I'll never make fun of old games again. This is hard.
Lloyd::: No wonder this game was never released. Who wants to play something called "Spiky-bomb-bricks-hot floors"?!
Nya::: Who cares what it's called?! It's endless!
Jay::: Hopefully not!
Lloyd::: What if it is? What if there's no way out?
Nya::: Guys, look! A loot box!Come on! Give me something awesome!Uhh, cyclones are not a good thing.They're whirling clouds of chaos that obliterate everything in their path.
Jay::: Whoa!Maybe the only way to beat this thing is a force of nature!
Nya::: Only one way to find out.I think this gives me the ability to use Airjitzu!
Jay::: Great, but it's only temporary. The flashes are speeding up!
Lloyd::: If you can Airjitzu, you can make it to the top of this maze!
Nya::: But what about you guys?
Jay::: Go without us. It's better than none of us making it.
Nya::: I've got a better idea. Hang on tight, boys!
Lloyd::: Wait, no! What're you-
Jay:::AH!
Lloyd and Jay::: AHHH!
Nya:::Cyclon-do!
Jay::: Whoo! Hoo-hoo!
Lloyd::: Guess it wasn't so infinite after all.
Nya::: Then they should call it the "Super long and incredibly annoying but eventually there's an end to it" maze.
Jay::: Yeah. Just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
Nya::: Well, no point in putting it off. Let's go.The music again? How can it get harder?!
Jay::: This must be the final boss battle.
Fighting Game Voice::: Choose your champion.
Jay::: So now it's an old school "fighting game?" MAKE UP YOUR MIND, DUDE!
Nya::: What does it mean "choose your champion?"
Fighting Game Voice::: Choose your champion.
Jay::: Okay, I think one of us has to fight the boss.
Lloyd::: I'll take this one.
Nya::: Are you sure? You only have one life left, Lloyd.
Lloyd::: Same as you.
Fighting Game Voice::: The champion has been chosen.Unagami will choose your opponent.Fighter two will be...
Lloyd::: 
"Harumi"::: Lloyd.
Lloyd::: Ha...Harumi?
"Harumi"::: It's good to see you again, Lloyd.
Lloyd::: How?
Jay::: It's not her, Lloyd. It's just a trick.A force field!
Nya::: Lloyd! Lloyd!
Jay::: No, no, no!
"Harumi"::: Did you miss me, Lloyd? I think about you so much. Sometimes I wonder...if things could've been different. Maybe in another time or place?Maybe we can be together again. You... and me. YAH!
Nya::: Lloyd!
Lloyd::: I can't fight her!
Jay::: It's a simulation! It's not her! 
"Harumi"::: HA-UH! 
Lloyd::: Ah!Harumi, don't do this!
"Harumi"::: You left me, Lloyd! All the people you save, and where were you when I needed you? Where were you?!Lloyd...I don't have long. But I wanted to say: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. If you could only give me another chance?
Lloyd::: Harumi, is it really you?
Jay:::No! Lloyd! It's not Harumi! The computer's just trying to get into your head!It's nothing but a program!
Lloyd::: Harumi, what did we do the first night we were alone together?
"Harumi"::: Watch the sunset?Listen to music?
Lloyd::: We went to the canals in Ninjago City. To give food to the poor. The real Harumi would've remembered that. You're not Harumi!
Avatar Harumi::: Rrrr...Ah! AH! 
Lloyd::: HAA-AH! 
Jay::: No!
Nya::: Lloyd!
Nya::: Jay. What do we do?
Jay::: We do what we have to do.We get our friends back......and we stop Unagami.
