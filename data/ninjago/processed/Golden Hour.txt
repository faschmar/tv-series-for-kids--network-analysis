Wu::: Time. The thread that holds the fabric of reality together. You cannot see it, you cannot hold it, and yet it seems you never have enough of it.
Nya::: Master, what are you doing?
Wu::: Putting off until tomorrow what cannot be done today.As you said, Acronix, it ends now.
Acronix::: No! It's destabilizing.
Krux::: We have to secure the other Time Blades!
Wu::: You may find this impossible with me in the way. 
Krux::: Or not!
Acronix::: Where are we? How did we get here?
Wu::: Not how, or where. But when?
Past Lloyd::: Kai! Help me!
Krux::: Ah, I see. How wonderful. Maybe we can end this before it even began! 
Acronix::: Huh? He got younger.
Krux::: No fair! That means he was hit by the Reversal Time Blade!
Acronix::: And the Iron Doom is using his reversal energy! If we get him, we'll have all the time we need!
Krux::: Ah, again.
Past Lloyd::: You guys ready for this?
Acronix::: There is no escape, boy! We will get you!
Acronix::: Ooh, lucky me. 
Wu::: As much as I wish to change this moment, I know that I cannot.
Krux::: I don't think we'll have a problem handling a bratty child with an embarrassing haircut!
Wu::: Then you've forgotten how rebellious we can be! 
Acronix::: Wait! The Time Blades belong to us! We are the Hands of Time!
Wu::: So you are. And you're nothing but second-hand thugs! Tick, tock! 
Krux and Acronix::: Nooooo!
