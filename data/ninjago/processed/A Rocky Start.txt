Cole::: Has anyone seen my sunscreen?
Kai::: No.
Nya::: Are you bringing sneakers or boots?
Zane:::Sneakers.
Kai:::Boots.Whoa!
Lloyd::: Ahh!Uh, hey, is that my Starfarer comic?
Kai::: You lent it to me, remember?
Lloyd::: Like a year ago.
Kai::: Ugh, take it. 
Zane:::You're not bringing that, are you?
Cole::: My soda guzzler? You bet!
Zane::: I thought we were supposed to pack essential items.
Cole::: This is essential! How am I supposed to quest and stay hydrated at the same time, Zane? 
Chicken::: 
Ninja::: No! 
Lloyd:::That's the last of it!
Wu:::What is the meaning of this?
Lloyd::: We're off on our quest, remember? To hone our ninja skills.
Wu::: How long are you going for?
Jay::: I dunno. Day or two?
Cole::: Just like you always say: Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
Wu::: I never said that.
Jay:::Ha! And you say we never listen!
Wu::: I never said that either.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Master Wu, perhaps this is an opportunity to field test the new joint tactical vehicles.
Kai::: Oh! What new joint tac-wha?
Nya::: Wow!
Lloyd::: Did anyone know this was here?
Cole::: No.
Kai::: Ugh. Nobody tells me anything.
P.I.X.A.L.::: We've been working on it for the past six months.
Jay::: I didn't even notice any construction!
P.I.X.A.L.:::You were playing video games.
Jay::: Eh?Huh.
Ninja::: Whoa!
Jay::: Wow! You should see that!
Kai and Cole::: Hohohoho!
Jay:::We have a secret base!
Ninja::: Whoa!
Cole::: No way!
Nya::: Wow!
Zane::: I can't believe it!
Cole::: Whoa!
Kai:::Hahahaha!
Nya:::What's that?
P.I.X.A.L.::: It is a heavily armored, six-wheeled mobile command vehicle. I call it the Land Bounty .
Cole::: Dibs on the cycle!
Jay::: Hmmm...
Kai::: I got the red one!
Jay::: Aww.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Each vehicle is equipped with an operations manual. Please be sure to thoroughly read— 
Nya::: Yeeehaa!
Jay::: Epic quest, here we come!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Did they even bring the luggage?
Cole::: Woohoohoo! This is awesome!
Kai:::Last one down the mountain is a rotten egg! Hahaha!
Jay:::Ah, yes. I miss this life. The open road, life on the go, adventure around every turn.
Nya::: Whatcha reading, Zane?
Zane::: A travel book about the region we're entering. It is called the Desert of Doom. My data files are incomplete on this subject.
Lloyd::: Really? Why do they call it that?
Zane::: According to ancient legend, local tribes once worshiped a giant thousand-year-old beetle, named Beohernie.One day, for no apparent reason, Beohernie became displeased with their prayers, and destroyed their village.
Lloyd::: Really?
Nya::: I have so many questions about that. I don't know where to start.
Jay::: Well, it's clearly a typo. Beohernie isn't even a name. They obviously named it Bernie. 
Cole::: Hey, guys? Anyone else starting to get hungry? Because I see a cool, little oasis coming up. 
Lloyd::: Good idea. Let's break, everyone.
Jay:::Oh, yeah.That hit the spot. 
Zane:::Hmm. Listen to this. Another interesting anecdote. Travelers entering the Desert of Doom should be wary of encountering mirages.
Jay::: Uh, mirages?
Zane::: An optical illusion. Often seen at sea or in the desert.
Kai::: Cool! I want to see a mirage.
Cole::: Uh, is there another PB & J?
Nya::: Check the cooler! 
Cole:::Whoa! Did you guys see that?
Kai::: I saw it. Unless it was a mirage?
Zane::: Mirages do not eat coolers.Oh, no!
Nya::: It's...
Cole::: What? What is it?
Jay::: It's Bernie!
Lloyd::: Run! 
Jay::: Aww, why did we park so far away?
Kai:::Huh-unh. 
Cole:::Woah!
Jay::: Cole!
Cole::: Oh-oh. My guzzler!
Lloyd::: Forget it! Run!
Cole::: Woah! 
Lloyd::: Don't look back, Cole! Trust me! Just run! 
Jay::: Eh, where is it? Where did it go? 
Lloyd::: It's... under us. Get us out of here, Zane!
Zane::: Hold on, everyone! 
Lloyd::: Give it more gas!
Zane::: The engine is at maximum acceleration. 
Lloyd:::Hooolddd onnn.
Jay::: To whaaat?
Nya::: Eh. Uh, Cole. Kai! We need help!
Kai::: On my way!Haha... Oh, I think he's angryyy... 
Lloyd::: It's gonna charge. Get out of there!Hang on, Kai!
Kai::: Man, this thing is fast!
Cole::: I'll try distracting it.Woohoohoohoo! Haha! Haha!Woah! Whaa-oh.
Nya::: What kind of weapons do we have? Didn't anyone read the manual?!
Jay::: Uhh, I was gonna read it.
Nya::: Ugh, never mind.Ha-yah! Pull the brakes! 
Jay::: Ha! You got him!
Lloyd::: Nice shot! 
Jay, Zane, Lloyd, and Nya:::Whoa!
Zane::: I think he's... got... us.
Lloyd:::The engine's overheating!
Nya::: We have a problem!
Lloyd::: We have to slow down!
Zane::: I'm... trying. 
Lloyd:::Yah! 
Kai::: What's he doing now?
Jay::: What do we do?
Lloyd::: We need to get off the sand.Zane, what is that?
Zane:::It is a cluster of rocks.
Lloyd::: If we can make it to those rocks, we might have a chance.
Nya:::It's worth a shot, if the engine holds out.Guys, there's some rocks due north. Head for those, okay?On three. One, two, three!Here he comes!
Jay::: Oh, he's chasing us!
Lloyd::: Punch it Zane!
Cole::: Huh. 
Lloyd::: What the—
Zane::: It's a mirage!
Kai::: Now I've seen everything.Or nothing.
Nya:::Over there!
Nya and Lloyd::: Arc left! 
Zane::: Another mirage?
Nya::: Oh, man! 
Jay::: Please be real, please be real, please be real!Ahh! 
Nya::: Hold on! 
Kai:::Argh!
Lloyd:::Everyone okay?
Nya::: Yeah.
Jay::: Uh-huh.
Zane:::Extremely.
Jay::: This is the worst quest ever!
Lloyd:::This is not good. This is really, really not good.
