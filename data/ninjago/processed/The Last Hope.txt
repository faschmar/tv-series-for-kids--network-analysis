Overlord::: The clock is only hours away from finishing its countdown to the Final Battle between good and evil, Garmadon. Why so sad?
Garmadon::: Me? Sad? Ha! Nonsense. I couldn't be happier. It's just...
Overlord::: Lloyd?
Garmadon::: I still have to battle my son in order to transform Ninjago into my image.
Overlord::: Battle and defeat, if evil is to prevail.
Zane::: It is good to have our powers back.
Jay::: Yup, you're right. And since we've all been working on our witty quips to follow every cool thing we do, I'd say we got this final battle in the bag. Or should I say…...I'd be shocked if we lose! 
Wu::: Enough! Are you trying to reveal our hidden location?
Kai::: Uh, sorry, Sensei. We were just practicing our cool new Elemental Blades.
Jay::: And our witty quips.
Wu::: Be wary of overconfidence, ninja. While it is true your powers can defeat the Stone Army, only Lloyd alone has the power to defeat Garmadon. When it is all over, then we will see who laughs last.
Ninja::: Yes, Sensei.
Julien::: Every cog, every gear is important. If one piece is missing, or out of place, the invention won't work.Come now, little one. Time to fly. 
Wu::: It is like you ninja. You each serve very important roles, and are key parts to a magnificent fighting force.
Cole:::Eat dirt, scumbag! 
Zane:::That is not a coconut!
Cole::: Nice reflexes. 
Zane::: Good to have you back, old friend.
Lloyd::: If we're all gears, what if I'm the gear that doesn't work? What if I don't do my part? What if I can't defeat my father?
Wu::: What if there are no more "What-ifs"? The Final Battle is almost upon us. When that time comes, we will know the answer to what ifs whether we like it or not.
Nya::: I know you don't want to face your father, but there is no other choice.
Misako::: But perhaps there is. I used to think it was inevitable, but the I found this. 
Cole::: You mean Lloyd doesn't have to fight? This I gotta hear.
Misako::: The scrolls say that when the Helmet of Darkness is bequeathed to its rightful ruler, the Celestial Clock will count down to the activation of an unspeakable weapon. The first sign that the Final Battle between good and evil has begun.
Kai::: Did you just say "unspeakable weapon?"
Jay::: Uh, I'm still stuck on what "bequeathed" means.
Cole::: Go on, Misako. Don't let us interrupt you. How do we stop the Final Battle?
Misako::: There is nothing here that explains what would happen if the Helmet of Darkness is returned.
Wu::: Interesting. Remove the helmet, the clock starts. Put it back, the clock stops.
Lloyd::: And the Final Battle never starts.
Jay::: Bequeathed, anyone? Is anybody gonna help me out with that?
Kai:::Uh, that sounds great and all, and I know we have our new powers, but you expect us to get past his whole army of Stone Warriors and pluck the helmet off his head?
Nya::: My brother's right. They're good, but they're not that good.
Misako::: I know. And that is why I am going to do it. I'll just need a little help.In order to get past their guards, we need to first get control...
Wu:::I'm sorry, Lloyd. This mission isn't for you.
Lloyd::: But I'm all powered up, I can help.
Wu::: We mustn't let you and your father come face to face yet. We're trying to prevent the Final Battle, not welcome it.
Lloyd::: Yes, Sensei.
Kozu::: To combat the ninja's new power, we have honored your request to step up defenses.
Garmadon::: Hehehe, I like what I see. 
Overlord::: Why build your forces, when all of your attention should be on completing the ultimate weapon?
Garmadon::: What good is an ultimate weapon if I'm not around to use it? Do not question my motives!
Overlord::: It is not your motives I question but your resolve. I fear you're hesitating as the hours count down to facing your son. So it is true.
Garmadon::: Never doubt my evil again! Not if you wish to remain my ally when I rule!Get back to building the ultimate weapon! And do not stop until it is complete.
Overlord::: Yes... now that is the Garmadon I am counting on
Misako:::Unhand me, you fiends!
Kozu::: Unt tin Klata vu! }
Cole:::Uh, what did he say?
Kai:::I don't know!
Zane:::I believe it is an ancient language.
Cole:::Well, somebody say something.Uh, bada-bada, bing-bong!
Kai::: Cheep, cheep, tita-ta-ta!
Zane::: Tick tock, uh, tick tock!
Jay::: Bequeath, bequeath, bequeath!
Misako::: That's right, you caught me. But I'll never tell you where our base is. And you won't hear another peep out of me, unless you take me to Garmadon. 
Garmadon::: I said that I was not to be disturbed.
Kozu::: Forgive me, my lord, but we have a prisoner who knows the whereabouts of your son's rebel base.
Garmadon::: Misako!
Misako::: It's been a while.
Garmadon::: I, uh…. Release her.
Kozu::: Yes, sir. 
Misako::: Take off that silly helmet. Let me get a good look at you.
Garmadon::: If you don't mind, I'd rather not.
Zane::: How about this? It's "ice" to see you.
Jay::: Uh, I don't know. I feel like you could do better.
Cole::: I swear I've heard that before.
Kai::: Ugh. I feel like a clunky mule in this thing.
Kozu::: Tuzo tong! 
Kai::: Uh, is he talking to us?
Zane:::I think he wants us to get working.
Kozu::: TUZO TONG! 
Jay::: Bequeath, bequeath, bequeath!
Zane::: Tick tock, polly wock!
Kai::: Pop-pop, peep-peep-pop!
Cole::: Wee-woo, wee-woo!
Garmadon::: So you know where our son is hiding, but I suspect you won't give him up that easily.I know you too well, Misako. Why did you allow yourself to get caught?
Misako::: Because I know you don't want to fight as much as Lloyd doesn't want to fight.
Garmadon::: Lloyd doesn't want to fight—uh, I mean, so Lloyd doesn't want to fight? 
Misako::: If you're still the man I once loved, I know you'd never want to see him harmed.
Garmadon::: But it is foretold. It is our destiny. I don't care about him. I only care about turning Ninjago into my own image.
Misako::: Then you're not the man I married. I should go. 
Garmadon::: No! Don't.Misako, I may look different, and evil may now course through my veins, but I am still the man standing before you.I want you to rule by my side.
Jay::: Aw, man! No matter how many bad situations we get ourselves out of, we never seem to be able to escape chores!
Cole::: What is that thing?
Zane::: It must be the unspeakable weapon Misako was talking about.
Cole::: Look, guys. An elevator. Sweet.
Kozu::: Soya! 
Cole::: Ah. Relax, relax. Forget it. Sheesh, what is wrong with these guys?
Kai::: I don't know about you, but that just looked like some sort of massive cannon.
Zane::: What do you suppose it's for?
Jay::: Oh, I don't know. How about to destroy us?
Stone Scout::: Tun meta! TUN META! 
Cole::: Hey, why don't you bonk someone your own size, half-stack?
Stone Scout::: Tun meta! 
Cole::: That guy seriously had it coming.
Ninja::: Ninja, go! 
Zane::: At least we get to break the ice! 
Kai::: Haha. Nice one, Zane!
Jay::: Now you're cooking with gas. Or should I say, electricity!Going down?
Cole::: Save some lines for us, Jay. I wouldn't want us to bowl over the competition.Oh, this is bad. This is really really— Bad.
Kai::: Let's get Misako and get out of here!
Ninja::: Ninja, go! 
Garmadon:::Misako, I'm glad you finally understand me. Not many people do, you see.Being evil these days is really unappreciated. But you...I always knew I could count on you.Huh? You deceived me? Stop her!
Zane::: You got the helmet!
Misako::: And you got spotted!
Jay::: Cole gave us away.
Cole::: All right, I've had a rough day. Can we stop laying blame, and focus on what's in front of us?
Kai:::Maybe we should worry about what's behind us.
Garmadon:::Cut them down to size. 
Misako::: If we do not return the helmet before the clock strikes zero, we won't be able to prevent the final battle.
Jay::: Don't worry, I'm on top of it! Yah, whooo!Oh, maybe not. Ugh.
Cole::: Didn't mama ever teach him the bigger they are, the harder they fall?Oh, apparently she did.
Kai:::Oh, great.
Garmadon::: Bye, bye!
Kai::: Ugh, well, we better think of something fast, because...I'm out of lines! Hey! 
Jay::: Whoa, it's Nya!
Nya:::Hey, guys!
Jay::: How did you know we needed you?
Nya::: Look up.Get in! Hang on. 
Garmadon::: Don't just stand there! Get them!
Overlord::: You fool! You let them get away with the helmet? Don't you realize if they put it on, they will control the Army?
Garmadon::: I'll see to it personally. It's my turn.
Jay::: Heh, cool hat. I wonder if it'll make me look more menacing. 
Nya::: Is that really wise? If that helmet turns you evil, we're kicking you out.
Jay::: Uh, is that possible? Uh, it's probably got Garmadon cooties anyway.
Wu:::Did we get the helmet?
Nya::: We did, and we're all accounted for.
Wu::: Then let's rendezvous at the clock.
Jay::: It's so dark in here. One of these have got to be a light switch. 
Kai::: Uh, sis, can we go any faster?
Nya::: We're going as fast as we can.
Cole::: We're definitely not going fast enough.
Nya::: Okay. 
Jay::: We're losing them!
Kai::: Whoo-hoo!
Zane::: Excellent.
Nya::: Awesome!
Zane:::Uh, oops.
Garmadon::: You won't get away from me again, Misako.
Nya::: Hang on! Have we lost him?
Kai::: Not quite!
Nya:::Ugh! It's stuck! 
Cole::: I think I'm gonna be sick.
Garmadon::: I finally have you ninja in the palm of my hand. 
Lloyd::: Let them go! 
Jay::: Ow!
Nya::: Lloyd, be careful.
Jay::: Holy cannoli, Lloyd and Garmadon in a face-off! Take the shot, Lloyd!
Cole::: He's vulnerable!
Zane::: Do not hesitate!
Kai::: Strike now!
Lloyd::: I'm sorry, Father. You leave me no choice. It is our destiny. 
Jay::: No! What is he doing?
Misako::: They're coming.
Misako::: Lloyd, we need to move!
Nya::: The clock is not too far from here.
Lloyd::: Okay!
Nya::: Better hop in, Lloyd.
Lloyd:::Go! 
Nya::: Wow. This clock is a mechanical masterpiece.
Misako::: You're welcome to dismantle it once we stop it.
Jay::: There's only a couple minutes left!
Misako::: Everyone, look for the helmet's perch! It could be anywhere.
Wu::: You don't know how to return the helmet?
Misako::: It has a resting place somewhere.Oh, that didn't work. Maybe here.
Zane::: Perhaps I found the perch! Ugh, no. Wrong place.
Jay::: Oh, what about here?
Wu::: Could this be the place?Oof!
Kai::: No!
Kozu::: There's only thirty seconds left. I believe it's time to die— No!
Misako::: Get the helmet!
Cole::: Right! 
Misako::: Ah! The helmet's perch!
Wu::: There's only ten seconds left!
Misako::: I'll get it. 
Wu::: Hurry, Misako!
Misako::: Okay! 
Kozu::: No!
Lloyd::: Ah! It worked!
Nya::: We did it!
Wu::: No.
Misako::: The Horns of Destruction. We were too late.
Garmadon::: Overlord, what has happened?
Overlord::: It has started.
Garmadon:::What is that thing?
Jay::: Nya!
Nya::: Jay!
Kai::: Sis!
Jay::: Let her go!
Kozu::: Or what? You will make a big splash?
Cole::: The ground!
Jay::: No, no!
Lloyd::: This is all my fault. I should've taken the shot.
Cole::: We're all at fault, kid. It's just the way the cookie crumbled.
Jay::: Ah! Are you still making jokes? They have Nya, and you're making jokes? 
Cole::: It was just a poor choice of words!
Wu:::Enough! We have lost enough. We don't need to lose our focus.
Kai::: Forget focus. We have to get my sister.
Misako::: By the time we get back up there, they'll be gone. We will get your sister, but the clock has reached a zero and the Final Battle could start at any moment. We must head back to the Bounty to get prepared, so that next time, you will not hesitate.
Wu::: Come on, Lloyd. Let's go home. You will get your chance.
Overlord::: Behold, the ultimate weapon. I give you ... Garmatron!
Garmadon::: It's more beautiful than I could ever imagine!
