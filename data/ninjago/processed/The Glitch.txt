Lloyd::: Nice to meet you, Okino. That's Cole, Kai, Nya, and Jay.
Nya::: Oh, gee, that's really not-
Okino::: I, Okino, samurai, pledge to serve you, and do all in my power to protect you and guide you to the Key-Tana.
Lloyd::: Thanks, Okino. That's-
Kai::: Just out of curiosity, when you said you failed all your previous masters, how many are we talking here? Two? Three?
Nya:::Kai...
Kai::: What? I can ask that, can't I?
Okino::: 
Jay::: Oh... Yeah...
Lloyd::: Okay, so a few. But this time will be different. Right, Okino?
Okino::: Yes, I swear it.
Lloyd::: Lead on, Okino. We trust you.
Okino::: This way. Into the Forest of Discontent. And then beyond, past the Cliffs of Hysteria. And finally, the Maze of the Red Dragon.
Kai::: Forest of Discontent? Why do they call it that?
Cole::: What was that?
Okino::: Thorns of Discontent.
Lloyd::: It came from those bushes.
Lloyd::: Let's spread out. Six targets are harder to hit than one.
Cole::: Good idea. I got the bush in the middle.
Nya::: I'll take the one on the left.
Jay::: I'll take the one on the right.
Kai::: I'll hang back and make sure no bushes are following us.
Kai::: What? I have one life left, remember?
Lloyd::: Okay. On three.
Lloyd::: One, two, three!
Jay::: Ninja versus Bushes! Attack!
Cole::: Wow! These new weapons are really awesome! That was-
Cole::: Ahhhhhhh!
Cole::: Ahhhhh! It got me!
Cole::: It got me! Aww, I just lost a life.
Okino::: You must be careful. In this place, all things, any flower, tree, or beast, seek to destroy you. Even the ground beneath cannot be trusted.
Cole::: Wow, it's dark in here!
Jay::: Hang on a sec.
Jay::: There, that's better.
Cole::: Great. Now I can see what I'm looking at, and it's even worse!
Nya::: So tell us about the Key-Tana, Okino. You said it's in a maze?
Okino::: Hai. Guarded by a fearsome beast. A dragon.
Lloyd::: We've faced plenty of dragons before.
Okino::: Not like this one. They say its teeth can rend any armor, its breath can melt steel, and its scales are impervious to even the sharpest blades!
Jay::: Nya!
Cole::: Hang on!
Nya::: Get me out of here!
Lloyd::: What the heck was that?
Okino::: Swamp-teeth.
Nya::: Swamp- teeth!?
Okino::: Even the ground cannot be trusted.
Nya::: I'll say one thing. Milton Dyer has a twisted imagination!
Lloyd::: What is it?
Okino::: Those vines. I think they are Strangler Vines.
Jay::: I don't like the sound of that.
Lloyd::: Strangler Vines? Great.
Kai::: Lloyd, you should check it out. It's your turn! Look, I already lost three lives, and Cole got hit by thorns, a-and Nya fell into the hole-
Lloyd::: Okay, okay.
Lloyd::: They're just normal vines-
Cole::: What were those things?
Nya::: Lloyd, are you okay?
Lloyd::: I'm fine.
Lloyd::: Who are you?
Ritchie::: I am from the Brotherhood of Rats, and I am sworn to silence. Do your worst, you'll get nothing out of me, nothing!
Lloyd::: So, you're working for Unagami?
Ritchie::: You're trying to trick me into giving away that Unagami ordered us to ambush you. Well, it won't work!
Cole:::Yeah, he's not the brightest, is he?
Jay::: So Unagami's cheating. To make sure we don't win the game!
Nya::: Oh, that makes me mad!
Okino::: Uh, game?
Cole::: Yeah. Prime Empire? Oh, wait. You're an NPC. You're part of the game. Nevermind.
Okino::: What...game?
Lloyd::: Okino, I know it's hard to believe, but this world, the forest, the traps, all of it, it's. . . it's just. . . it's only a game, Okino. It's not real. We're all stuck inside a game, and Unagami is the guy calling the shots. He's the one who made this whole place.
Okino:::Game! You are testing Okino! You think I am so easily fooled? Ha ha!
Kai:::No, Okino, we're telling the truth.
Jay::: Uh, he's not programmed to understand that kind of stuff, Kai. He's part of the game.
Okino::: Hahahahahaha! Game.
Nya::: So what do we do?
Lloyd::: This doesn't change anything. We already knew Unagami was trying to stop us. Now we know he's playing dirty. Let's keep moving!
Ritchie:::Oh no! No no no no no! I got an itch! You gotta help! You gotta do something! You gotta, you gotta scratch it!
Lloyd::: Give me one reason I should!
Ritchie::: Ooh, ooh, okay, okay, I can help! I know a glitch!
Nya::: A what?
Ritchie::: A glitch! A glitch in the game! A shortcut! Oh geez, it itches, to get past the forest! Oh come on, you gotta help! You gotta cut me down! Oh, get it!
Cole::: Huh. What do you think?
Lloyd::: He could be telling the truth. Games have glitches sometimes.
Jay::: Oh yeah! Like Fist to Face! Remember that game? Where you can step right through the wall?
Kai::: If he's telling the truth, this could save us a lot of time.
Okino::: What means this word, glitch?
Jay:::Um, it's hard to explain.
Lloyd::: If we let you down, will you have to promise to lead us to the glitch.
Ritchie::: Ooh hoo hoo, yes! Yes, I promise! Just get me down! Come on, come on, let me down!
Ritchie::: Ah, ah, that's it right there! Ah...
Ritchie::: Come on! This way! Hurry!
Nya::: You sure this is a good idea?
Lloyd::: What do we have to lose?
Ritchie::: There. See it?
Ritchie::: That's it. Jump in. Like this.
Okino::: What devilry?
Lloyd::: It's okay Okino. You don't have to follow us. This is the glitch. We can go it alone from here.
Lloyd::: Look out! It's a trap!
Ritchie::: Ha ha! Suckers! Long live Atta the Ratta!
Cole::: You lousy rat!
Nya::: Lloyd! There's too many!
Okino::: Hi-ya!
Nya::: Okino!
Okino::: Go! I will hold them off!
Lloyd::: After the rat!
Red Visor::: Patch the glitch!
Kai::: No!
Lloyd::: Okino! Come on!
Okino::: Go! Save yourselves!
Lloyd::: Okino! I'm not leaving without you. Now run!
Kai::: Ugh-we made it. We actually made it!
Lloyd::: Okino. Thank you. You saved our lives back there.
Cole::: Uh, most of our lives.
Lloyd::: Are you okay Okino?
Okino::: You told me the truth. This world, my world, is a glitch?
Lloyd::: A game. Yes.
Okino::: And I am part of it. A pawn.
Lloyd::: No. If you were just a pawn you wouldn't have helped us. You decided to save our lives. You made that decision, not Unagami. Okino, we wouldn't have made it without you!
Okino::: If I cannot trust in what I see, in what I believe, what should I trust?
Lloyd::: You're a good person, Okino. How about you trust in yourself? And in your friends?
Okino::: My friends?
Jay::: Yeah. Us.
Jay::: Because we're gonna to need all the help we can get.
