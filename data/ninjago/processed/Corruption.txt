Vex::: Huh? 
Warrior:::An intruder, my Lord. We found him skulking outside.
Vex:::Not skulking! Walking. I am a traveler from the South. I come seeking you, Oh, king.
Grimfax::: For what?
Vex::: To offer my services as an advisor.
Grimfax::: I have an advisor already. 
Vex::: Ah, but does he know the Formlings?They are a tribe of dangerous shape-shifters, who live to the south of the mountains. Even now, they scheme against you, plotting and planning.
Grimfax:::So say you. . . Vex.Yes, I know who you are. You are Vex the Formless. I know of your lies. Formlings have never troubled us and we will not trouble them. Give him food, water, and a decent cloak and send him on his way, before his jealousy sours us all.
Vex::: You will regret this moment. All of you! I will return! And you will wish you had treated me better! 
Vex::: Ah. Mmhmm. 
Ice Fisher::: Hey! You there! Stop! 
Vex::: Oh.What? 
Zane::: Ahh!Hello? Is anyone there?Where am I?Perhaps I should find shelter, but I can't leave you here.It's no use. Unless? 
Vex::: Oh. 
Zane:::A cave. I suppose that will suffice for now.What was that? 
Vex::: Incredible. 
Zane:::Greetings, friend. If you have found this recording, then I am no longer here.My name is Zane. I'm a stranger in this land, trying to find my way home.It's difficult to keep track of the days in this place. It feels like I've been here a long time...
Vex::: Hmm. 
Zane::: ...but I refuse to give up hope. I am attempting to repair the mech. Unfortunately, the processing unit is damaged. In order to fix it, I must connect myself to the mech and run a system diagnostic. If anything were to interrupt the diagnostic, it could cause my operating system to reboot. In case something goes wrong, this is the last recording of Zane, Master of Ice. Son of Dr. Julien.
Vex::: Zane? 
Zane::: Student of Master Wu. I was built to protect those who cannot protect themselves and I have tried to fulfill this purpose. Goodbye to my friends... and...to P.I.X.A.L, I love you.As Kai would say, here goes... nothing!
Automated Response::: Commencing system diagnostic. Do not remove data cable. Data interruption may result in system failure and/or memory loss. Commencing diagnostic. 10% complete.
Vex::: Huh.Hey.Ahem.
Automated Response::: 20% complete. 30% complete.
Vex::: Eh, heh-heh. 
Automated Response::: 40% complete. 50% complete.
Vex::: Huh?
Automated Response::: 60% complete.70% complete. 80% complete. 90% complete.Rebooting. All systems online. Memory cache: Empty.
Zane:::Hello?
Vex::: Hello.
Zane::: I am sorry. Wh-where am I? Who are you?
Vex::: Don't you remember? I am Vex.
Zane::: Are we... friends?
Vex::: Most certainly.I am your loyal adviser.
Zane::: But... who am I?
Vex::: Oh, such a pity. You truly have forgotten. You're unwell, my Lord, but do not fear. I will take care of you. It is my sworn duty.
Zane::: Your duty?
Vex::: You are the Ice Emperor, the ruler of this realm.
Zane::: I am?
Vex::: Of course. Why look.Here is your scepter.
Zane:::Is this... my home?
Vex::: Alas, at the moment, yes. But it was not always. You were cast out of your proper home by warriors, who took it for themselves. But now that you are awake, perhaps we can reclaim it.
Zane::: Would you advise me to do so?
Vex::: Most certainly.
Grimfax::: Who are you? What is the meaning of this?
Vex::: Have you forgotten me so soon?
Grimfax::: Vex, what do you want?
Vex::: Only to see justice done and my Lord return to his rightful throne.
Grimfax::: What Lord? This throne is mine.
Vex::: Not anymore.
Grimfax::: Guards! Throw them out!
Warriors::: ARRGH! 
Grimfax::: Seize them!I said seize him!Who are you?
Vex::: He is the Ice Emperor and you will obey or perish!
