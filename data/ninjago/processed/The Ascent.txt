Cole::: I've got an idea. But this one's a little nuts.
Plundar::: "This one"?
Wu::: Let's hear it.
Cole:::These are the tracks we found earlier, which I'm guessing lead to the surface. And let's pretend this is the mine cart.Then, we get in the carts, and go zipping back up the tracks, like this. 
Korgran::: Explosion is us?
Plundar::: That idea seems a little ... what's the word I'm looking for? Oh yeah. Nuts.
Cole::: I told you that at the start! Yeesh, nobody listens.
Vania::: Well, I don't hear any other suggestions, so unless you guys want to give up and just go back to Rock-Bottom...
Wu::: I vote in favor of Cole's plan.
Fungus::: As do I.
Korgran::: Korgran also. And also Korgran's non-speaking axe.
Korgran's axe::: Haha, you guys are bananas!
Korgran::: Uh...
Fungus::: Well, Plundar? What do your dice advise?
Plundar:::I'm deciding this one, and you've gotten me this far, so I'm with you all the way.
Cole::: I don't get it! There's no buttons, no dials. How are you supposed to operate this thing?What?
Wu::: What did you do?
Cole::: Nothing! I - I barely touched it!
Wu::: Hmm. Is it possible that this mech is powered entirely by Elemental Energy?
Cole:::Haha! This is gonna be a piece of cake!Sorry, my bad.
Plundar::: Uh, left. A little left!
Korgran::: Careful!
Wu::: Keep it together, Cole! Concentrate!
Cole::: Okay, I think I've got it now. You can do this. It's just like walking on roller skates. On really big, giant-sized roller skates.Whoops, uh, sorry about that!Whoops. Uh, sorry!
Wu::: Cole.
Cole::: Okay, I definitely got it now.
Wu::: Let's go!
Cole::: Everyone ready?
Vania::: No, not really. I'm worried.
Cole::: Don't be. This is gonna work!
Vania::: Not that. It's ... my father. If we get out of here, I'm going to have to face him, aren't I?
Cole::: Yeah, but not alone. We'll be with you.
Vania::: Okay. Let's do it!
Cole::: Here goes nothing! 
Plundar::: Is it too late for me to change my mind?
Korgran:::No no!
Wu::: This is outrageous!
Vania::: Cole, the Lava Monster. What if it's still in the cave, waiting for us?
Cole::: What, just standing there, staring at a wall? No way, I'm sure he's gone back to his -Eat my dust! 
Wu::: You did it, Cole! We're losing him!
Fungus:::Oh, dear.
Cole:::Get off! Whew. Hey!You again?This thing has a sword? Yeah!
Vania::: Cole, the mine cart. Stop the mine cart!
Wu::: Cole!
Cole:::Master Wu!
Vania::: Hurry, Cole! We're not gonna make it!
Cole::: Yes we will! 
Korgran::: This stone thing flies too?
Cole::: You guys okay?
Wu::: We're going too fast!
Cole::: I can't slow it down! The lava's overheating the controls! This is gonna get a little bumpy!
Old Woman::: What did you say, Engelbert?
Engelbert::: Me? Nothing.
Old Woman::: Huh, but you made a sound.
Engelbert::: What kind of sound?
Old Woman::: A sound, like "Whaaaa".
Engelbert::: Don't be ridiculous. Why would I make a sound like -
Cole::: Are you okay?
Vania:::Oh, look! We're in the palace gardens!
Fungus::: Is that the sky?
Wu::: It sure is!
Plundar::: You mean we made it?
Korgran::: We're out? 
Plundar::: We made it!
Korgran::: We are not longer Lowly!
Fungus::: We're the Upply!
Upply::: Upply! Upply! Upply!
Vania:::Chompy? Did my father do this to you? Oh, that makes me mad! That makes me so mad! Just hang on, Chompy. Cole? 
Hailmar::: Halt! Princess Vania?
Vania::: Hailmar.
Hailmar:::You.
Vania::: Hailmar, it's okay. Cole is a friend.
Hailmar::: The King gave orders for the ninja to be arrested. On sight! He said they are traitors.
Vania::: That's not true. My father is the traitor, Hailmar. He's lying to you!
Hailmar::: Stand aside, Princess.
Vania::: Hailmar, listen. My father is lying to you. He's using you! Cole and these men, they were betrayed by my father. They were cast into the mountain.
Hailmar::: Stand aside, on the King's orders!
Vania:::Go!
Cole::: What?
Vania::: He won't hurt me. Just go!
Wu::: Cole, I will stay here. Find the others, save them!
Hailmar::: On the King's orders, I command you, stand aside!
Cole::: Master Wu, catch!
Hailmar::: Stop! I command you! 
Vania::: Chompy!Chompy?
Hailmar::: Attack! Stop!
Vania::: Hailmar, stand down! I command you! I am heiress to the throne of Shintaro, and your future queen!
Hailmar::: Call off your dragon!
Vania::: Not until you're ready do listen!
