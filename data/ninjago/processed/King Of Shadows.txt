Jay::: I spy something... white!
Cole:::Could you try to be quiet for once? This ain't easy.
Jay:::I spy something broken!
Zane::: Sensei's wisdom is beyond my own.
Wu::: The most powerful move in Spinjitzu can only be accomplished when all four elements are combined. Earth! Ice! Fire! Lightning!
Jay::: Uh, what happens when all of them are combined?
Wu::: The Tornado of Creation. The power to create something out of nothing.
Wu::: No, Kai! If done incorrectly, it will lead to disastrous consequences.
Kai::: Disastrous consequences. Right... 
Cole::: Uh... wasn't me.
Kai::: Did I do that?
Wu::: No. We are here.
Cole::: Whoa... looks like someone's already been here.
Zane:::The shurikens!
Zane::: Ow.
Zane::: We're being followed.
Jay::: Now let's go!
Jay:::Heh, alright!
Kai::: Come on, Sensei. Join us.
Wu::: There is still one weapon left! We must get our sleep!
Jay::: Aww, Sensei. Look, you gotta admit, we're kicking their boney butts.
Kai::: Get up here. Show us some moves.
Wu::: I guess I could. Now this move is very special.
Zane::: But if done incorrectly, will it lead to disastrous consequences?
Kai::: Zane, is that a joke? A sense of humor... you found it!
Wu:::Shake what your momma gave you. Yeah, look at this one now. Hmm... oh yeah. Spin round. Oh yeah. I put my feet.
Nya:::Kai... Kai...
Kai:::Huh?
Nya::: Kai...
Kai::: Was that...?!
Nya::: I have to go... 
Kai::: Nya! Wait up!Slow down! Why are you running so fast?!Nya! Where are you?! 
Nya::: Kai...
Kai::: Nya? 
Kai:::Nya!
Nya::: Don't worry. 
Garmadon::: I'm right here, brother. 
Kai::: Garmadon.
Garmadon::: Forgot something?
Kai::: You can't hurt me here. You're banished. Trapped in the Underworld.
Garmadon::: And that is why 'you' are going to remove the Sword of Fire for me.
Kai::: I don't think so!
Garmadon::: Are you sure about that?
Nya::: Kai!
Kai::: Nya!
Garmadon::: If you don't remove the sword, how else will you cut the chains to save your precious little sister?
Nya::: You know it's a trap. I can... free my...self.Okay, that's tight.
Kai::: Nya!
Garmadon::: Tick tock. Tick tock.
Kai::: Ninja, go!
Kai::: Stay close.
Nya:::Trust me, I'm not going anywhere.
Kai:::You can't hurt us! You're only a shadow!
Garmadon::: Even shadows have their uses.
Nya::: Kai! Look out!
Kai::: Stay back, Nya.
Nya::: Stay close, stay back. Make up your mind.
Nya::: That's not fair!
Garmadon::: Oh, am I being too hard? 
Garmadon::: Brother. I see you protect one, but what about the other three?
Wu::: They are safe! Far from you grasp, Garmadon!
Garmadon::: I wouldn't be so confident.
Samukai::: I believe these belong to Lord Garmadon now. 
Wu::: My brother must not unite the four weapons. We must keep them apart!
Garmadon::: Awaken, guardian of the deep! They're stealing the Sword! You must not let them escape!
Kai::: There's no way out! He's taken away all our options.
Wu::: All but one. 
Kai::: Sensei, what are you doing?!
Garmadon::: No, you fool!
Wu::: If he is to bring the other weapons here, then I will take the Sword of Fire to the Underworld. It is my sacrifice to pay.
Kai::: No! It's mine. I shouldn't have come on my own. You don't have to do this! There has to be another way!
Kai::: No!
Garmadon::: Then I will see you there, Brother! 
Kai::: This is all my fault. Sensei won't be able to hold up for long.
Nya::: Forget Sensei. What about us?
Samukai::: To the Fire Temple!
Skulkin::: Yeah!
Garmadon:::My brother has taken the Sword of Fire to the Underworld. Hurry! Return home and unite the weapons before it's too late!
Samukai::: Uh... change of plans. To the Underworld!
Kruncha::: What happened to your weapon?
Cole:::Great. Now what?
Jay:::Now, we get outta here.
Cole::: Uh, Jay. Before you do that, you might wanna......warn us.
Zane::: Let's go!
Samukai:::Faster! We need to go faster to cross over to the Underworld!
Cole::: There they are!
Samukai::: More speed! We'll never get home at this rate.
Samukai::: Uh... what's wrong?
Samukai::: Get them!
Jay::: Ninja, go! 
Jay:::Okay... that's why they make keys.
Jay::: Hey, Cole... 
Cole::: Jay. Sorry. I didn't see you.
Zane:::Greetings... 
Jay:::We didn't stop them.
Cole::: You don't need to say it. I know. We've lost.
