Nya:::Wow. It is cold up here.
Jay:::Yeah. My hands are frozen.I can barely feel my...Huh? Wha-ah!
Nya::: Jay!
Cole:::Huh? 
Jay::: Ahh! 
Cole::: Jay? Do you mind? I'm trying to work here.
Nya::: Jay! Are you okay?
Jay:::Aw, yeah. Just great. But I'm getting a little tired of all this ice and snow. 
Cole::: Hey, Nya? Ice is water, right? Why can't you just, you know, use your Elemental Powers and clear away all this snow and ice for us?
Nya::: Guess I can't command water when it's frozen. It won't move.
Cole::: Aw, that's a bummer.You could've been really useful.Wouldn't that be awesome? If she could just wave her hands and presto! Job done!That would save us hours and hours of slow, boring, back-breaking work.Oh, well, we'll just have to do it the slow, boring, back-breaking way.Ow! Hey...
Jay:::Speaking of slow, where's Kai? 
Children::: Hey! Fire Maker! Fire Maker! Fire Maker!
Child #1::: Make the fire! Make the fire!
Child #2::: Mine too!
Child #3::: Cook mine! Cook mine!
Kai::: Okay, okay, one at a time. 
Child #2::: Oh, yeah! You were right! Look at his big gang!
Kai::: Hey, where are you going? There's more where that came from! Fire Maker has more miracles!
Nya::: Fire Maker has more miracles?
Kai::: Eh, just keeping the kids entertained.
Nya::: Ah, okay, as long as you're not straining yourself.
Kai::: Oh, no. I feel great! You know, this place is actually growing on me. It's really not so bad. 
Jay:::Well, that's good. That's what it's all about, isn't it?
Cole::: You bet. Rest and relaxation.
Kai::: It is?
Nya::: No! It isn't! 
Cole:::Hahaha!
Kai::: Hey! 
Sorla::: What troubles you, Nya?
Nya:::Nothing, I... I'm happy for Kai. His powers are coming back and that's... great, I guess. It's just... 
Sorla::: What?
Nya:::My own powers. In this place, they don't work. I can't do anything.
Sorla::: You are a Water Elemental, are you not?
Nya::: Yes, but the water here is frozen. I can't control ice. They're two different elements.
Sorla::: They are different, but one. There can be no ice without water.
Nya::: It doesn't listen to me.
Sorla::: Then you must speak more clearly. 
Nya:::Ugh! Stubborn piece of ice!Oh!That's it! I hate ice! And I hate this... this place!And I hate...!
Lloyd::: Nya? You okay?
Nya::: I... it's nothing. I just feel... useless without my powers.
Lloyd:::You're not useless—whoa! In fact, that's what I wanted to ask you. I need you to protect the village with the others, in case those Ice Samurai come back. 
Nya::: What about you?
Lloyd::: I have to go away for a while.
Nya::: Going after Zane? I hope you don't think you're going alone. We're coming with you.
Lloyd::: I've thought about this, Nya. There's only two ways into that castle, by force and by stealth, and force won't work. You've seen how powerful the Ice Emperor is. 
Nya::: So we sneak in, like the crafty ninja we are. 
Cole::: Ahh!
Kai::: Ha-unh! 
Lloyd::: One of us has a better chance than five. And the Ice Emperor will be watching you guys, not me. He'll send more of those Blizzard Samurai here, which is why I need you to stay and protect these people.
Nya::: So we draw his attention, while you sneak in and find Zane.
Lloyd::: Exactly.
Nya::: It's risky, but it could work.
Lloyd::: It will work. Trust me. 
Nya:::At least take this with you. It's key to the mech. If you get close enough, it should start beeping.
Lloyd::: Okay, thanks.
Jay:::And you'll need this.
Lloyd::: What's that?
Jay::: Dried fish. Not as bad as it sounds. Kind of like beef jerky actually.
Kai::: You want me to light it for you? 
Lloyd::: No, thanks. I'll save it for later.
Kai::: Oh, good. 'Cause I'm actually kind of wiped. My powers aren't fully back yet.
Cole::: Watch your back out there. 
Vex::: You will be pleased to know that you may soon have some company. A stranger from another realm, clad all in green. Whoever he is, he will of course fail as all who stand against the Emperor do. But, if you join us, perhaps his life could be spared. A warrior with your abilities, could prove most valuable.The Emperor rewards those he values. What say you—Stubborn to the end. So be it. The green one will perish. 
Lloyd::: Gah!Huh. Wow.I've never seen a wolf like you before.What do you want? I bet you're hungry. Well, don't even think about it. I fight back.You can eat that, okay? Truce?Gah!Wojira's wrath? Wojira's wrath!You saved my life. Thank you. My name is Lloyd. What am I doing? I gotta be crazy. You can't understand me.It's getting colder. We need to find shelter.I don't believe it! The-the Land Bounty!P-p-please w-w-work. Oh, what a mess. Scopes are down, systems are fried. This is hopeless.Even if I rescue Zane from the castle, we still have no way home. What was I thinking? I can't do this alone.Easy for you to howl. You're a wolf.Tomorrow, I go back to the village and make a new plan.Huh?What?The mech? Wait! The mech! If it still works, that would give us a chance against the Ice Emperor! What do you say? You in?Huh. Awesome! Hang on, Zane! Here we come!
