Dareth::: Heh, I told you they'd do it.
Edna:::Oh, is it the ninja?
Lou::: It must be.
Man::: The ninja have won?
Lou::: Haha, we're saved!
Brad::: About time.
Lou::: Now to get this place back in order.
Dareth::: What the... Two and a half...
Overlord::: Three. 
Dareth::: Haha. You missed.Oh, no.We shall meet again. This I swear! Where are those ninja?
Lloyd::: Can I still fight?
Julien::: Hmm, I'm sorry. That leg will take weeks to heal.
Lloyd::: We don't have weeks. 
Wu::: The battle between good and evil will be decided today.
Kai::: And we can't even get to the fight, much less get off this island.
Jay::: Ah. I wonder if I'll ever see Nya again.
Zane::: Perhaps it's best to think of our friends as we remember them in our hearts, not as they are now.
Lloyd::: But I don't remember my father any other way.
Misako::: Your father loved you. It was the evil of the Great Devourer that corrupted him.
Kai::: Sensei, I don't understand. The prophecy said the Green Ninja would defeat the Dark Lord. Why didn't we win?
Wu::: I...don't know.
Jay::: Don't know? You're Sensei! You always know! You have a long white beard!
Kai::: There must be some message to learn. A lesson. A word of wisdom. Just a word? Something.
Wu::: For once, I'm afraid there is nothing to learn. Only that evil has won.
Lloyd::: If Sensei doesn't have a lesson, then I do. I used to be nothing but trouble, but then I met you guys. You took me in. Showed me the importance of being brave, the importance of being strong. And most importantly, being good.When this battle first began, when the First Spinjitzu Master fought the Overlord and his back was up against the wall and he knew it was all over, did he quit? No. He found a way to keep the fight going. He passed his Elemental Powers to us. Of all people, a bunch of kids. But there must have been a reason he chose us. I'd like to think it's because he knew we'd never back down, we'd never give up. We've learned the ancient ways of the ninja. And ninja never quit.
Kai::: He's right. If that means we have to swim the sea to get off this island, then so be it. 
Jay::: The entire ocean? But I didn't bring my floaties.
Kai::: Ugh.
Cole::: Well, if you got a better plan...
Zane::: I don't, but he may. 
Julien::: Ooh, the Falcon. He must have found something.
Zane::: You brought us back to the Temple of Light? I do not understand. We've already been here.
Misako::: This location, I've seen this before. I just never understood it. 
Kai:::I think I found something. It's just like the map. 
Wu::: There's one more over there.
Julien::: And here.
Misako::: And over here.
Kai::: What is it?
Jay::: Cool.
Misako::: It is the fighting suit the First Spinjitzu Master used when he battled the Overlord.
Cole::: You mean the First Spinjitzu Master once sat here? Haha, get out of here!How do you make this thing work?
Julien:::Sadly, I think time has done her in. She's only a relic now.
Wu::: If it worked for the First Spinjitzu Master, perhaps it will work for the next Spinjitzu Master?
Lloyd::: It's worth a shot. 
Cole::: Hey, watch out. 
Lloyd::: Hmm, nothing.Whoa!
Cole::: Whoa!
Kai::: Looking good!
Jay::: Killer!
Zane::: Amazing!
Wu::: How does the leg feel now?
Lloyd::: Stronger.
Misako::: Well, I know how he is getting to Ninjago, but what about us?
Jay:::I know that sound. It's our dragon!
Wu::: I believe we just found our way off this rock.
Kai::: I see Ninjago. We're not far away! 
Cole::: Oh, you sure that's Ninjago?
Jay::: Wow.
Kai:::What is that thing?
Wu::: Garmatron.
Misako::: It's turned into a fortress?
Julien::: But where's the Overlord? 
Kai::: He's turned everyone evil.
Jay::: Oh, just like Nya.
Cole::: And now they're helping his cause. I can't wait to see the look on the Overlord's face when he gets a load of us.
Jay::: Oh, my goodness.Oh, sweet mother may I.
Kai::: Look out, Jay!
Zane::: Is that the look you were hoping for?
Jay::: Zane, no.
Misako::: The metamorphosis is complete. The Overlord's changed into his original form. 
Cole::: But we can't fly up there.
Wu::: We have my father's Golden mech. We have to draw their fire to help Lloyd use the mech against the Overlord.
Cole::: We hear you loud and clear.Everyone, hold on tight!
Kozu::: Wait. Wait. Wait. Now! 
Cole::: Look out, Sensei!
Kai::: Pull up! Quick, pull up!
Misako::: The Stone Army is protecting its master. They will never let Lloyd get close.
Wu::: Then we have to get close.
Dareth::: Yeah. I knew they'd be back.
Lloyd::: Time to bring out the big buttons.Ninja— 
Wu::: He's been hit.
Misako::: We need to protect him.
Lloyd::: Ugh. Oh, no! Ugh.
Ninja::: Ninja, go! 
Lloyd::: Ah. I'm okay.
Jay::: Yeah, but are we?
Zane::: Ice! 
Kai::: Good job, Zane!Fire!
Jay::: I know we've always drawn a crowd, but this is ridiculous.
Kai::: How can you be making jokes at a time like this?
Jay::: Hey, if I'm going down, might as well go down laughing.
Zane::: If this is how we're going to go down, I'm proud to be fighting alongside my brothers.
Cole::: Hear, hear. 
Wu::: We need to go back and save them.
Misako::: There are too many. Look.His helmet must have fallen off during his transformation.
Julien::: What does that matter?
Misako::: He who wears the helmet, controls the Army.
Wu::: What?
Misako::: It was written in the scroll. What if the helmet is more than just the key to the clock? What if that helmet is the reason Garmadon was able to control the Stone Army in the first place? If we can get to that helmet, we could stop the Army.
Julien::: What are we waiting for?
Lloyd::: Keep fighting! Unh. Never give up!
Kai::: Ninja never quit!
Ninja::: Ninja, go! 
Jay::: We're doomed, guys.
Misako::: There it is. 
Dareth::: Ah, finally, a little protection for my noggin.
Misako::: Wait!
Dareth:::Eh, what? 
Kai::: What happened?
Zane::: They are frozen.
Kozu::: All hail the Brown Ninja! What do you command?
Jay::: Brown Ninja?
Dareth::: Hehe, what's up, fellas? Looks like we all know who's in command now.
Cole::: The helmet controls the Army. Well done.
Jay::: Oh, that means we now stand a fighting chance.
Lloyd::: I need to get to the top of that fortress. I may not be able to get there by myself, but with your help, I can face him.
Ninja::: Ninja, go! 
Dareth::: Where'd you get those? I want one.
Kai::: You too, Brown Ninja.Today, you're one of us. Shall we do it once more, just for old times' sake?
Dareth::: Ninja, go! Army! About face! Stone Army, go!You better get this back. 
Misako::: Let's help them out.We're hit!
Wu::: We have to land. This is as far as we can go.
Jay::: Look out! 
Lloyd::: Cole, come on. Get up!
Cole::: Ugh. I'm hit. Go! Go on... without me. Ugh.
Kai::: We need to move. Now!
Lloyd::: Jay!
Jay::: Get out of the way!
Kai::: Don't look! Just keep climbing!
Zane::: Ugh. From my calculations, with the distance remaining to the top, the odds are that only one of us is going to make it.
Lloyd::: Then let's beat the odds! Let's—
Zane::: Go on. I'll hold them back.
Kai::: Nya!
Kai::: I'm gonna draw her fire so you can make it to the top.
Lloyd::: No, don't! We can do this together.
Kai::: No. There's only one Green Ninja. This is your fight.
Nya:::You're hurt, you hardly stand a chance!
Kai::: Hiya!Go, Lloyd!
Lloyd::: I have come here to fight you!
Overlord::: You're in no shape to fight. It's over. Evil wins.
Lloyd::: A ninja never quits!
Overlord:::You don't even have a sword.
Lloyd::: I don't need a sword. 
Overlord::: Then all I have to say is... goodbye.
Lloyd:::Aah!Hiyah!
Misako::: He has become the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master.
Wu::: This is the Final Battle.
Lloyd::: I am the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master!
Overlord::: No.
Overlord::: No!
Dareth::: Awesome!
Overlord::: You can't defeat me. Where there is light, there will always be shadow!
Lloyd::: Unless my light is bright enough!
Lloyd::: This. Ends. Now.
Overlord::: You can't defeat me.No. No! NO! NOOO! 
Kai::: Ugh. What happened?
Kai and Jay:::Nya! 
Kai::: My sister.
Jay::: Nya, you're back! 
Cole:::Come here, you tin can. 
Zane::: Brother.
Julien::: Is this really happening? We did it?
Dareth::: We did it. You did it. I did it! Heck, who didn't do it!?
Kai::: Yeah. But where's Lloyd?
All::: Lloyd!
Misako::: You were brilliant, son.
Wu::: Because of you, Ninjago was saved. Because of you, there will be a tomorrow.
Kai::: Speaking of which, if the Overlord should ever decide to show his face again around here, we'll be ready.
Cole::: And next time, we'll be a little more humble.
Zane::: And a little more wise.
Jay::: And with better catchphrases.
Misako::: We will all miss your father.
Garmadon::: Lloyd. What... what happened?
Misako::: Garmadon, is it really you?
Lloyd::: Dad? Oh, dad! 
Misako::: Every ounce of evil and venom is... gone. 
Garmadon::: I feel good. Aha! It's been so long.
Wu::: Good to have you back, brother.
Garmadon::: Wu! Good to be back.
Jay::: Aw, would you look at that? Who would have thought we'd ever see the day? You think we should dogpile them?
Kai::: Let's give them their moment. They earned it.
Cole::: It's been quite a ride, fellas.
Zane::: You think there will be others?
Cole::: I hope so. I liked being a ninja. It's not like we have many other skills.
Jay::: Ha, speak for yourself, I'm looking forward to doing a little inventing, maybe some model-building, dabble in poetry—
Kai::: Jay's right. We've come a long way and there's no reason why we can't use what we've learned in our everyday lives. And who knows? We may have gotten the balance right today, but there's always tomorrow. There's no way of knowing what's around the corner. But as long as there's something worth fighting for, there's always a need for a ninja. And we'll be ready.
