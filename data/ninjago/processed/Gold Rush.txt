Kai::: I can't believe you broke it!
Nya::: I broke it?! You broke it!
Kai::: Uh, Dr. Borg can fix it.
Nya::: If we get there.
Kai::: This is why I never let you drive!
Nya::: But I am the better driver. 
Kai::: It's my car!
Cyrus Borg::: Nya, Kai, where are you? 
Nya::: We are on our way, Dr. Borg.
Cyrus Borg::: According to my calculations, the shadow banshees will overtake Ninjago City in less than, uh, five minutes! Is the Idol of Unity safe?
Kai::: Uh, more or less?
Cyrus Borg::: Good. When you get it, place the idol on the beacon. Its power should destroy the shadow banshees.
Nya::: Hope you are right, Dr. Borg.We have to tell him eventually.Not even a scratch.
Kai::: You think you can do it better?
Nya::: Watch me!
Kai::: That's my bike!
Nya:::Uh, what gives?
Kai::: We just have to outrun them.
Nya::: Then I'll see you at the tower, slowpoke.
Kai::: Almost there!
Nya::: Not fast enough, bro. 
Kai::: Nya?
Nya::: Kai?
Kai::: Nya?!
Nya::: Kai?!
Kai::: Nya!
Nya::: Kai! I thought I lost you.
Kai::: At least we are together now.
Nya::: What do we do now? 
Kai::: Wait a second!
Nya::: The idol...
Kai::: ...of...
Kai and Nya::: ...unity! 
Kai::: Yes!Ninja, Go! 
Nya::: Come on, bro. Let's go to save Ninjago City! 
Kai::: Now! 
Cyrus Borg::: You did it!
Kai::: I knew I can do it.
Nya::: I made a flying car.
Kai::: Hey, I was the one who did that.
Nya::: What?!
Cyrus Borg::: That, you both saved the day.
Kai and Nya::: Exactly!
Kai:::You know, you really should have let me drive.
Nya::: Is there a banana in your hair?
