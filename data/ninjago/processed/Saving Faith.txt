Harumi::: Is what?! Two-faced? That isn't me, Emperor Garmadon.
Garmadon::: Hmm.
Mystake:::You're the impostor! Arrest her n—
Garmadon::: Let. Her. Speak.
Harumi::: That is Mystake. The shape-shifting Master of power against us.
Garmadon::: Well done, Harumi.It's good to have you back, my child.
Harumi:::The pleasure was all mine, Father.
Skylor:::He's not your father. His son is Lloyd— 
Garmadon::: I thought I smelled an Oni.Looks like your plan backfired.
Mystake:::The only thing that backfired is you turning against your father's realm. Ninjago is a place of light, and you are a source of shadow.
Garmadon::: You know it all turns to darkness.
Mystake:::The future is not in your hands.
Garmadon::: Show me, Oni. Show me your real face. Or are you worried what your friends might think of you, demon?
Mystake:::Maybe I'll show you. 
Mystake:::But only for you to see what a full-blooded Oni can do.
Harumi:::No!Don't let her touch the Emperor!
Mystake:::Ee Mah Vee-aza-bub.Ee Mah Vee-zaz-bub. 
Harumi::: My Emperor, look out! 
Mystake::: Never trust... an Oni.
Skylor:::Gotcha.
Harumi::: Don't let her leave!
Mystake::: Go, Skylor! 
Harumi::: It's over.There's nowhere to go. 
Garmadon::: Surrender.
Mystake::: Surrender? Never heard of it! 
Garmadon::: That was your last mistake, Mystake.
Killow::: Skylor escaped. Hunt her down!
SoG Rider::: What about the old woman?
Killow::: Oh, we no longer have to worry about her. 
Skylor::: Oh, no.
Cole:::Yeah. That's her.
Wu::: We have to go down and save her.
Kai::: No, we have to get the Dragon Armor. In case you've forgotten, they don't have the map and we do.
Zane::: Kai is correct. And it appears this could be a trap.
Cole::: Well, maybe more of his memories came back. Something that could help us in a situation like this.
Kai::: Is that true? Do you remember more?
Wu:::I can't lie, they haven't. But my father told me I have to have faith, and without her, we would have never gotten this far. Besides, ninja never leave friends behind. 
Kai:::And we've got your back.
Wu::: They must have left her here for the elements to finish her off.Are you okay? 
Faith:::You should not have come. It's a trap. 
Jay::: And... it's a trap. 
Iron Baron:::Eat up, Hunters! We have the son of the First Spinjitzu Master. By first light, with him by my side, the Firstbourne will gladly give up the rest of the Dragon Armor. Then, it will be a feast, every night!
Jay::: Could you pass a roasted lizard stick up here? I'm hungry too. No? No takers? Oh, that's okay, I'm-I'm kind of watching my figure anyway.
Wu::: I'm sorry. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I've only made it worse.
Faith::: Hmm. Your heart is pure, but this realm is cruel. I am just sorry you ever had to find this place.
Kai::: I don't sweat a little, Wu. We've seen worse. Any moment, Zane will have cut through the binds and we'll be out of here.
Zane::: Um, I cannot cut through these binds, Kai. Perhaps, there is another alternative you were thinking of?
Kai:::But, Zane, I'm the good looks of the team. You're the brains.
Jay:::I thought I was the looks.
Cole::: No... you're the annoying one.
Jay::: What are you? The Party Pooper?
Kai::: Mr. Party Pooper to you.
Cole::: Har har, Hair Gel. 
Wu::: How can you all make jokes at a time like this?
Kai:::You got this one, Jay?
Jay::: Well, when all hope is lost, sometimes a good laugh is all you need to stay positive. Helps cope with what's bad while opening your eyes to what's good.
Wu::: I understand, Jay.You are the annoying one.
Jay::: Eh-heh... 
Kai::: He's got you over.
Wu::: Did I do that right?
Jay::: Yeah.
Wu::: A joke? 
Iron Baron::: What is so funny?
Faith::: What is funny is you feeding them this food, to cover the taste of your lies.
Iron Baron:::Well, I'd rather be eating food with them, than stuck on a pole with you. 
Faith::: He only cares for himself. If he gets the armor, he'll have no need for you except to kiss his hand! 
Iron Baron:::Let me ask them, Heavy Metal. How can you believe anything she says, when she hid behind a mask? 
Daddy No Legs::: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's true. That is definitely not what I had expected.
Faith::: It's he who is the fraud! He forced me to wear the helmet just as he forced you to be his slaves!We have all heard Baron's stories about how he had fought an army of Oni. Well, look around! We are on Oni land, and yet has anyone seen a single one?
Dragon Hunters:::Yeah. I have not seen any.
Faith::: No. You have not, because his stories are just that. Stories! The Oni left these lands long ago, yet he keeps you in fear of them. His power over you is built on lies! Brave Hunters died so that he could get the Dragon Blade. How do we know it was not him, who took their lives?!
Dragon Hunters:::How do we... though... ninja is true...
Iron Baron::: Not another word!Now, show of hands. Raise them if you're with her, so I can raise my Dragon Blade to lop them off! 
Jay::: That's not fair! You bullied them!
Iron Baron::: I said, "Not another word!" 
Past Wu::: The best way to defeat your enemy is to make them your friend. Never put off until tomorrow what can be done today.
Wu::: I remember.I remember it all. 
Jay::: Oh my gosh! He just grew a mustache.And a goatee!
Iron Baron::: Get him!
Wu::: You will let my ninja go, or else.
Iron Baron::: Or else what? 
Wu::: Or else I will reclaim my father's armor and ask his dragon to end your rule. I am the Son of the First Spinjitzu Master and this is my oath! 
Jay::: Alright! Master Wu's back, baby!
Iron Baron:::So you just confirmed it. The Legend is true: He who reclaims the Armor controls the Firstbourne.
Wu::: That's not what I said.
Iron Baron::: You seem like a wise master. Are you really ignorant enough to take on me and my entire camp? 
Cole::: Don't give in, Master Wu. We've got your back.
Kai::: Yeah. If you can cut us down first.
Iron Baron:::Before you do something foolish, let me make you an offer. How about you get me the Armor or else we can see right now how good you really are with that... staff.
Wu::: You want me to take you to the Firstbourne?
Iron Baron::: Get me the Armor and I'll send your ninja home. 
Wu::: Do I have your word?
Faith::: Don't—
Iron Baron::: Trust me. There's nothing I want more. 
Kai::: Oh, no!
Wu::: I'm sorry, but we are left with no other choice.
Iron Baron::: Ah. We go now to the Firstbourne. 
Wu::: Don't worry, ninja. Have faith.
Faith::: I hope he knows what he's doing.
Kai::: We've learned not to question him.
Jet Jack:::You promised whoever got Heavy Metal would become your Number Two. Since it was me, I must insist I go with you for your protection.
Iron Baron:::Protection?Once I have the Armor, I won't need protection. It will be you needing me. 
Lloyd::: Skylor!
Nya::: Where's Mystake?
Skylor::: I... I...
Dareth::: She didn't... make it? 
Ultra Violet:::Target last seen at the intersection of Nelson and LaMonica.
Killow:::Got it. We're moving in.
Nya::: You were followed.
Lloyd::: Did you touch him?
Skylor::: Yes.
Lloyd::: Can you control it?
Skylor::: Not sure. But there's one way to find out. 
Nya::: Yes! Woo-hoo!
Lloyd:::Yes! Haha. Alright.
Dareth:::It's working! 
Skylor::: That's... not... me.
Nya::: Garmadon is controlling it! We have to go.
Lloyd:::You can do this. Take control. Break his hold.
Skylor:::I... can't.
Dareth::: Uh... that's close enough for me. 
Nya::: We need to get out of here. Your father's too powerful.
Lloyd::: Control it, Skylor. I have faith in you. You felt his power and now it's yours. You can do it. Control it. Feel his power.Control it.
Harumi::: Destroy them.
Skylor:::I'm... doing it.
Lloyd::: Yes! Now use it. 
Killow::: There. On the rooftop.Watch out! Where are you going? Cowards!
Ultra Violet:::Now we will have a fight! 
Skylor::: I wanted to do this for a long time. 
Garmadon:::No! No.No!
Skylor::: Yes.
Dareth:::I always knew you could do it.
Nya::: It's time to knock the emperor. Off. His. Throne. 
Nya::: Yes! Woohoo! 
Harumi::: Stop it!
Garmadon::: I-I can't.
Harumi::: We must leave. It's not safe here anymore.
Garmadon::: I do not flee. I control!I am the Emperor. I am the Destructor.I am in control! 
Nya::: Something's wrong. 
Garmadon:::No.Yes. 
Lloyd::: My father's power. It's too strong.
Skylor:::I can hold on. 
Garmadon::: I am in control.
Nya::: His power. It's hurting her!
Skylor::: I—
Son::: Mom, Dad, don't leave me! 
Mother::: Please, take him. 
Son:::No...
Past Harumi::: I wanna stay. Mama!
Past Harumi's mother::: We'll see you when we get down. I promise!
Harumi::: I'll get you out. Together.I promise. 
Mother::: Thank you.
Harumi:::Go. I'll find another way. 
Nya::: Let go, Skylor! Let go! 
Lloyd::: She can't.His power will kill her.
Garmadon:::My child.
Harumi::: No. 
Lloyd:::Rumi... 
Garmadon:::No!You want this city, Lloyd? Then you can have it, in ruins! 
Nya:::I—I can't wake her up. It's like his power poisoned her.
Dareth::: Whoa whoa whoa, Doctor of Dark Arts. Should any of us really be making a diagnosis?
Lloyd::: No. Nya's right. I think the only way to save Skylor is to get his power out of her. 
Dareth::: I don't know anything about that. But I do know what's coming our way!
