Lloyd::: Master?Is it okay to speak? I don't want to interrupt if you're meditating.You're meditating, I'll wait. 
Wu::: What, Lloyd?
Lloyd:::Me and the guys decided we're going on a quest. To get back in shape and hoard our ninja skills?
Wu::: Good.
Lloyd::: Yeah, except, um, the thing is, we can't think of a quest. We were hoping you had a quest tip.
Wu::: Quest tip?
Lloyd::: Suggestion? Idea? For a quest?
Wu::: Have you become so lazy, you can't even find something to do on your own?Don't come to me for a quest tip! Go out and find a quest! Adventure does not come to the idle, it comes to those who seek it. So, seek. 
Lloyd::: Right. O-okay. We'll seek. 
Cole:::How'd it go?
Lloyd::: He's... in a-a mood.
Jay::: Did he give you a quest tip?
Lloyd::: No, he said we have to figure it out on our own.
Kai::: I've been thinking about it for five minutes! I'm tapped out!
Jay::: Maybe when we need a change of scenery. Sometimes ideas come to you better if you change your surroundings.Nope, still nothing.
Kai:::We need a villain.
Cole::: What about Ultra Violet?
Kai::: Uh, she was nuts. I'd rather face Killow.
Zane::: They're both incarcerated in Kryptarium Prison.
Zane::: The Departed Realm.
Cole::: Pythor?
Zane::: Whereabouts unknown. Locating him would require some effort.
Cole::: Effort? Uhhh, no. 
Kai::: Eh, finding a good villain is hard.
Jay::: Let's face it: There aren't any villains left, except well, um...
Lloyd:::Say it. My dad. 
Nya::: Wherever he is, he's not really a problem right now. Let's move on.
Cole::: Who does that leave?
Nya::: Maybe we're aiming too high. Maybe we don't need a villain. Maybe we just need like... a criminal or a gangster.
Jay::: Pfft. I'd settle for a bully.
Zane::: Perhaps we should check in with the Commissioner. We might be able to assist him in the prevention of some crime.
Ninja:::Yeah. Good idea.
Policemen:::Ahh!
Commissioner::: 
Lloyd:::Commissioner!
Commissioner::: Ooh, ooh, wh-wh-what is it now? Robot Pirates? Lava Zombies?
Cole::: Huh?
Lloyd::: No. Nothing like that. We just want to help you catch some bad guys.
Commissioner::: Oh. Well, actually, it's been pretty quiet around here. We don't have any outstanding warrants.
Kai::: Aww, there's gotta be something for us to do.
Commissioner::: Hmm. Not really. Take a look at the board.
Kai::: Oh.Aha! Who's that?
Commissioner::: Oh, that? Oh, that's a joke. Someone drew a monster.
Nya::: What about an escaped convict? Or a fugitive?
Commissioner::: Nope. Nothing.
Kai::: Um. A felon?
Commissioner::: Nope.
Kai::: Hoodlum?
Commissioner::: No.
Kai::: A crook?
Commissioner::: Nope.
Kai::: Monster?
Commissioner::: Nothing.
Ninja:::Aww.
Jimmy:::Sir?
Commissioner::: Oh, what's up, Jimmy?
Jimmy::: Just got a tip about an illegal bootlegging operation down at the wharfs.
Lloyd::: We got it! 
Kai::: Yeah! You guys relax, we'll handle this.
Lloyd::: Okay, on three. Kick open the door, storm the place, and take them down.Freeze right there!
Salesman:::Aah!Uh... You young fellas wanna buy some prune juice?
Ninja:::Aww.
Lloyd::: There's gotta be something.
Nya::: An outstanding warrant? Unpaid parking tickets? Anything?! 
Commissioner::: What's up, Jimmy?
Jimmy::: Something about a disturbance at the Kryptarium Prison.
Lloyd:::Yes!
Nya::: Jackpot! 
Cole::: That sounds terrible!
Jay::: We better get in there!
Lloyd::: On three! One, two, three! 
Inmate::: Shh!
Noble::: Oh, hi, guys.
Lloyd::: I don't understand. Where's the riot?
Noble::: Riot? Oh, goodness, no. Just a little dispute. But we worked it out, didn't we, fellas?
Inmate #1::: I overreacted, and I apologize.
Inmate #2::: And I'm sorry I expressed myself so poorly.
Lloyd:::Where now?
Cole::: Do you think the prison cafeteria has... cake?
Lloyd, Kai, Jay, and Nya:::Aww.
Zane::: Since we're here anyway, perhaps we should check in with Killow.
Kai::: Yeah. Maybe he's up to something.
Nya::: Hello, Killow.
Killow::: Oh, hi, guys.
Nya::: Don't "Oh, hi, guys" me. What are you up to?
Killow::: Nothing. I'm just trying to finish up my painting. You like it? 
Jay::: Ehh, it's okay.
Kai::: Uhh, why does the puppy have a stick of dynamite?
Killow::: Oh, well, he's an angry puppy. But he's learning to control his anger, just like me. I find painting very soothing.
Lloyd:::Thanks for nothing, Killow. 
Jimmy::: Got a cat in a tree.
Cat::: Meow.
Kai::: Ahhh! 
Nya::: Whoa!
Lloyd::: No!Ahh!
Zane::: Ow. 
Kai:::There's your cat.
Girl::: Mister Whiskers!
People::: Ahhh!
Robber #1::: Alright, ladies and gentlemen, this is a stick-up!
Robber #2::: Cash, watches, wallets in the bag. Now!
Director::: Stop! Cut! Cut! Cut! This isn't in the script! Who ought to write these changes?!
Lloyd:::Oh, boy.
Jimmy::: Coffee spill in the break room!Someone used the last roll of toilet paper.There's a bull in the china shop. 
Lloyd:::I can't believe this is happening to us.
Nya::: There is literally nothing to do in the entire city.
Zane::: Statistically, the absence of a single crime of felony in a city this size is remarkable.
Cole::: I wish I understood what you just said, but I don't.
Kai::: How is it a city this size has no crime?And how is it that you're always working on that model ship, and never make any progress?!
Commissioner:::What?
Kai::: Oh, never mind.
Lloyd:::What is going on with us? We're getting loopy. We're ninja! We need action, suspense, danger!
Jimmy:::You guys could help me with some filing.
Lloyd::: How is that dangerous?
Jimmy::: If you're not paying attention, you could get a paper cut.
Lloyd::: If I ever see another file again, it'll be too soon.
Nya::: Let's never do that again.
Cole::: So many paper cuts. I can't believe I lost to a filing cabinet.
Wu:::Hmm.
Lloyd:::Let's not tell anyone about this day.Ever.
Nya::: Okay with me.
Cole::: Me too.
Jay::: Me three.
Clutch Powers::: Absolutely nothing, Gayle. I haven't been inside and I don't plan to.
Gayle Gossip::: But... I thought⁠—
Clutch Powers:::You wanna know what's inside? Traps, booby-traps. Bunkloads of them. Pitfalls and blow darts and fake tiles that collapse when you step on them. Big boulders that drop on you, no thank you. 
Gayle Gossip::: But... isn't that your job, as an archaeologist to you know, explore and go on dangerous quests?
Clutch Powers::: Technically, yes. What's your point? 
Gayle Gossip::: Well, someone has to go inside.
Clutch Powers::: It would take a ninja to survive what's in there. Do I look like a ninja?!
Gayle Gossip::: No.
Clutch Powers::: Point made. 
Lloyd:::That's it! That's our quest!
Nya::: I'll pack my bag!
Cole::: Sunscreen! Bring lots of sunscreen!
Jay::: Ooh, this is going to be so much fun!
Ninja:::Ninja, GOO! 
Gayle Gossip::: Well, there you have it. Gayle Gossip broadcasting from a mysterious secret pyramid, that's... gonna stay secret, because no one's going in.And I got my hair done, especially for this case. What a bust.
