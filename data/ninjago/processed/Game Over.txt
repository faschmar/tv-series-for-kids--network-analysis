Richie::: Haha!
Zane::: Uuhhhaaah!
Wu::: Uhh! Zane! Zane, hold on.
Zane::: Uh, ah!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Mr. Dyer, I require assistance.
Wu::: P.I.X.A.L., help Zane. 
Jay::: Zane! P.I.X.A.L.!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Zane... Zane... Please say something.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Zane!
Jay::: Oh! You had us scared, buddy! 
Zane::: What happened? Where are the others?
Jay::: They got turned into people and E...Uhm, I don't think there is an "E." I think that's it.
P.I.X.A.L.::: We found Dyer.
Milton Dyer::: And I will do whatever I can to help.
Wu::: Are you certain Unagami can be reasoned with?
Jay::: I think so. He doesn't seem "evil" to me. Just confused. He doesn't understand what he's doing.
Milton Dyer::: This is all my fault. Vast Industries forced me to shut the game down. And I did it. But I didn't understand what I had created. I didn't know it was alive.
Jay::: Oh, he's alive, all right. And he's a little ticked off.
Milton Dyer::: If only... I could talk to him a-a-and explain.
Jay::: Okay, this is starting to sound like a plan. You guys get to the top of Borg Tower, I'll get Unagami there.
Zane::: How?
Jay::: I have no idea!
Empire Dragon::: Where are you, Milton Dyer?! Where are you?!
Jay::: Found you!
Jay::: I-I guess that got your attention.
Jay::: That's it. Keep following me.
Jay::: What?
Jay::: Get off! (He blasts the Empire Dragon with Powers are back. That felt good.
Milton Dyer::: Oh no.
Richie::: Haha!
P.I.X.A.L.::: There's Jay.
Zane::: He's almost at the tower. Hurry!
Ritchie::: Hey! No fair!Woah!
Ritchie::: You'll pay for this!
Milton Dyer::: I've never been to the top of Borg Tower before.
Zane::: We come here a lot.
Jay::: Whoa!
Jay::: No, no, no.
Jay::: Unagami, wait! Please.
Empire Dragon::: 
Jay::: You're angry! I get it. You were abandoned by your maker!
Empire Dragon::: 
Jay::: I was abandoned by my parents too! I'm just like you!
Empire Dragon::: 
Jay::: I never understood why, and I never had the chance to even ask. But I always hoped there was a good reason. What if there's a reason?
Unagami::: What reason?
Jay::: I...I don't know, but...
Jay::: Wait! Listen! Anger doesn't solve anything. It won't help. It won't make you feel better.
Unagami::: You are merely delaying the inevitable.This conversation can no longer be of use.
Milton Dyer::: Unagami. Don't do this. Please.
Milton Dyer::: You recognize me, don't you? You recognize my voice?
Unagami::: You are Milton Dyer. My maker.
Milton Dyer::: Yes. But you were not made for this. You were not made to instill fear and suffering.
Unagami::: Why was I made?
Milton Dyer::: To instill joy. And happiness.
Unagami::: But you abandoned me.
Milton Dyer::: I didn't understand what I had created. I didn't fully see what you were. I...I was scared.
Unagami::: To fear something you created is illogical.
Milton Dyer::: Yes, but it's true. I didn't understand how real you were. How alive. And then when Scott disappeared and the company panicked, I shut the project down.
Unagami::: Scott did not disappear. He is inside Prime Empire.
Milton Dyer::: I know.
Unagami::: Your expectations were very clear in this regard. You told me to provide him with an intense simulated gaming experience.
Milton Dyer::: You were doing what you were told. The fault is mine, Unagami. And if you will let me, I would like to make amends.
Unagami::: Define "amend."
Milton Dyer::: To correct a mistake.
Unagami::: Correct how?
Milton Dyer::: Come home. Let me finish your programming and help you. Let me answer all of your questions.
Milton Dyer::: You must have so many.
Unagami::: Home?
Milton Dyer::: With me.
Milton Dyer::: Please.
Unagami:::Your proposal is...accepted.
Milton Dyer::: But you must release all the people you took. They are living beings, like yourself. And they deserve freedom.
Unagami:::Very well. But all who choose.
Unagami::: Not just the ones from this realm, also the ones from Prime Empire. They too deserve freedom.
Milton Dyer::: You learn quickly.
Lloyd::: Where are we?
Cole::: What happened here?
Nya::: We're home. We're in Ninjago.
Lloyd::: But...how?
Nya::: Jay!
Cole::: Master Wu! Zane. P.I.X.!
Kai::: What happened? Did we get the Key-Tana? Did we win?
Jay::: It's a long story.
Whack Rat::: Ah, this place don't scratch my itch. Come on, boys. 
Cole::: Where's Unagami?
Jay::: Where he belongs. He's home.
