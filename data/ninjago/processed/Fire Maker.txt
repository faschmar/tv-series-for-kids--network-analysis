Uthaug::: Do you think they like to eat fish?
Boma::: Who?
Uthaug::: You know, the strangers, from Nimblago.
Boma::: Everyone likes fish. And it's not "Nimblago." It's Ningabo.
Uthaug::: That's not what they said.
Boma::: Honestly, Uthaug, whose hearing is better? Yours or... ?Listen! Do you hear?
Uthaug::: Blizzard Samurai! Heading our way!
Boma::: We have to warn the village. 
Sorla::: Your friend, Ice Emperor's castle. There are only two paths through the mountains. This is the safest.
Lloyd::: A pass?
Sorla::: In the Old Tongue, it's called Mala-Wojira.
Lloyd::: Mala-Wojira?
Sorla::: Wojira's Wrath. But you must be careful. You cannot make a sound in this place. You cannot speak or whisper. Even your footfalls must be like a gentle breeze.
Lloyd::: Why?
Sorla::: If you make a sound, Wojira will strike you down.
Lloyd::: Okay... but what is it?Okay!Great, well, I guess we'll just be quiet.Any luck?
Nya::: Nothing. It's really weird. The signal keeps coming in and out.
Lloyd::: Huh. Maybe the cold is interfering?
Nya::: Cold shouldn't matter. It's like the signal is weak. The mech had a brand new battery, it makes no sense! 
Kai:::Hey guys? Have you tried these? You gotta try them! You can walk! On top of the snow!
Cole::: I... think that's the point.
Jay::: What will they think of next? 
Uthaug::: Alarm! Alarm! They're coming!Blizzard Samurai! On the march!
Boma::: Heading for our village! We saw them coming down the pass!
Uthaug::: I heard them first. Boma's hearing isn't as good as mâ€”
Boma::: Don't start that again!
Sorla::: Boma! Uthaug! Are you sure you saw this? You saw them?Gather the elders. There's no time to lose.
Elders:::What if he... must consider?
Elder #1::: What do we do? The pass is only a few hours away.
Elder #2::: We have to hide. We must abandon the village.
Elder #3::: And leave the Fire behind? Are you mad?
Elder #1::: What choice do we have? I say we hide in the village of the Formlings.
Elder #2::: I won't go there! Not after what happened. That place is cursed! 
Elder::: It is only option.
Sorla::: We cannot abandon the Fire. The Fire is life! We must protect it.
Kai::: I don't understand. Can't you just light another? You know, with matches? Or something? 
Sorla::: They are new to our realm. They do not know. The winters have grown too cold. It is impossible to light a new fire. We have kept this fire going by adding wood every morning and every night.It has burned for decades.
Kai::: I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Sorla::: The Fire is life. If the Fire dies, so will we.
Lloyd::: What if we moved it somehow? Maybe we could transport it with torches?
Sorla::: The risk is too great. The Hearth Fire is the heart of our people. It keeps the darkness at bay and gives us hope. If the Fire goes out, our hope is lost. No! We must stay and protect it. We must fight.
Lloyd::: Then we will fight with you.
Elders:::Yes! I cannot believe.
Sorla::: Go! Prepare yourselves!Do not fear for us, Kai. All will be well.
Kai::: I just wish I still had my powers. I was Master of Fire. I could've made a new fire like-like... like this. 
Sorla::: And now you cannot?
Kai::: No. A snake woman named Aspheera stole my Elemental Powers.
Sorla:::Oh, do not worry, Kai. Elemental Power comes from within, like courage. Sometimes it wanes, sometimes it waxes, but it cannot be stolen.
Kai:::I'm pretty sure it's gone.
Sorla::: What comes from within will grow again. Give it time.
Cole::: 
Lloyd:::Look out!They're here! This is it! 
Boma::: They are so many. 
Lloyd::: We can take them!
Cole::: Yeah! Just get ready to bring it!
Uthaug::: Take what? Bring what?
Cole::: "It!" You know, like, uh, "Let's rock!""Throw down!" "Brawl!"
Uthaug::: I don't get it.
Cole::: Never mind, just follow my lead. 
Jay::: Are these guys made of ice?! 
Cole::: Some of them are frozen warriors, others are just ice!What about these guys?All ice! 
Lloyd:::Ha-ahh!
Jay:::Yah! 
Cole::: Hoi-yah! 
Lloyd:::Whoa! Did you see that?
Cole::: I saw it! It's like the ice was controlling him! 
Sorla::: Kai! 
Grimfax::: You dare defy the Ice Emperor! 
Kai::: Uh, unh, gah! 
Grimfax::: You will obey or perish! Rarh! 
Lloyd::: Ha!
Kai::: Oh! Hi, Lloyd.
Cole::: Heads up! 
Lloyd::: It's over.You've lost.
Grimfax:::You sheltered the newcomers. You should have known not to defy the Ice Emperor. 
Kai::: The Fire. He's going for the Fire! 
Nya::: Stop him!
Kai::: NO!
Grimfax::: You have won the battle. But without your Fire, you have lost the war.Fall back! 
Child::: M-mommy, I'm c-cold.
Kai:::I'm sorry.
Sorla::: It is not your fault, Kai.
Kai::: I just wish there was something I could do.
Sorla::: You have done all you can, have you not?
Kai:::Mmph! Mmph! Mnh! Aargh! 
Elder::: Fire Maker. 
Elders:::Fire Maker. Fire Maker. Fire Maker.
Kai::: I did it!
Nya::: You sure did!
Elders:::Fire Maker. Fire Maker.
Lloyd::: Just listen to them!
Elders:::Fire Maker! Fire Maker! Fire Maker! Fire Maker! Fire Maker!
Vex:::Rrrgh!
