Lloyd::: I'm worried about Okino. He took the news pretty hard.
Cole::: Wouldn't you, if you found out your whole world was nothing but a simulation, and you were part of it?
Nya::: We gotta cheer him up.
Lloyd::: Yeah. Okay, nobody say anything about Key-Tana.
Kai::: Well, what do we talk about?
Lloyd::: Anything. Just, keep it cheerful.
Jay::: Uh, so, Okino, what do you do around here for fun, anyway?
Okino::: Fun is an illusion.
Cole::: Hey, how about that sky? Look at those clouds!
Okino::: The clouds...
Okino::: Lies!
Kai::: Say, Okino, how do you get a ninja to cross the road? You say, ninja-go! Get it?
Okino::: There is no road. Only the nothingness is real.
Cole::: That was a terrible joke.
Kai::: You got a better one?
Kai::: Tell me those aren't the Cliffs of Hysteria.
Cole::: That's not a cliff. That looks like a wall that never ends!
Nya::: Definitely not double-jumping up that thing.
Jay::: Yeah, Okino, I'm not sure if I can climb that, and if I can't do it, these guys don't stand a chance!
Kai::: Thanks, Jay.
Cole::: Honest, but insulting.
Lloyd::: We don't even have a rope!
Okino::: You can buy some from Shifty.
Lloyd::: From who?
Shifty::: Greetings, travelers! Welcome to Shifty's Tables! Step right up and take a look, this is the finest merchandise in all of Terra Karana! There's green leather armor there, and those arrows are genuine poison tipped, and oh, who might you be?
Nya::: Um, Nya.
Shifty::: Nya! Oh, sounds like a flower. How may I help you, Flower Nya?
Nya::: Just Nya is fine.
Jay::: Actually, we are looking for a grappling hook and rope.
Shifty::: Aha! Climbing the Cliffs, eh? Well, it's a good thing you came to Shifty. I've got the best rope in town! Let's step over to the rope department.
Cole::: How much for the grappling hooks?
Shifty::: Twenty credits each. Normally. But for a friend of Flower Nya's, fifteen.
Lloyd::: We'll take six.
Shifty::: A wise choice! Now for the rope. We have two kinds. Rope of Supreme Durability, and Rope of Questionable Integrity.
Kai::: Uh, that's what you call a no-brainer. We'll take the Rope of Supreme Durability.
Shifty::: Another wise choice! Well, that'll be six-hundred credits, please.
Kai::: What!? Six-hundred?
Cole:::That's more than the grappling hook!
Shifty::: Quality rope isn't cheap my friend.
Jay::: Woah, woah, woah, woah, what about the friends of Flower Nya discount?
Shifty:::I'll throw in a free arrow.
Kai::: We don't have that much.
Cole::: So what do we do?
Jay::: No! I refuse! I am not buying Rope of Questionable Integrity from some guy named Shifty!
Nya::: What choice do we have?
Jay::: Well, lots of choices, um, we, we could turn around and go back, do some grinding, earn some more credits. Or, we could all tackle him at once-
Lloyd::: We can't do that, and we don't have time to go back! We'll take the Rope of Questionable Integrity.
Jay::: No, no, no, we won't!
Nya::: Jay, will you relax?
Shifty::: Huh, well that's strange. Those don't usually turn up unless there's Energy cubes to collect.
Nya::: Energy cubes?
Shifty::: When someone gets cubed, the drones take them away.
Jay::: Where?
Shifty::: To Unagami.
Lloyd::: What for?
Shifty::: Yeah, I was curious about that myself. As luck would have it, I have friends in high places, I sold the Mad Sushi Chef his knives.
Nya :::Who?
Shifty::: Oh, you haven't met him yet, well, he's a great bloat. Anyway, he told me "Unagami's building something, something big. A machine."
Lloyd::: What kind of machine?
Shifty::: Yeah, he didn't tell me that part.
Shifty::: Huh, never seen one do that before.
Jay::: Um, maybe we should get going.
Lloyd::: Yeah, good idea.
Nya::: Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Run! Grab the rope!
Shifty::: Wait! You forgot your complimentary arrows!
Kai::: Hah! Their too late! See y a, fellas!
Kai::: What? I didn't know they could do that!
Lloyd::: Faster!
Cole::: We're sitting ducks up here!
Shifty::: Hey! Oh, hello! We'll just put you right over here.
Nya::: Cole!
Cole::: Not again!
Cole::: I'm okay!
Nya::: Cole, your rope is breaking!
Nya::: Cole! Hurry!
Cole::: I am hurrying!
Nya::: Hurry faster!
Nya::: Watch it, your rope is going to break!
Lloyd::: Kai!
Kai::: Ha! Gotcha!
Jay::: Yeah, nice!
Kai::: Ha ha, yeah! How do you like that, huh? Not so fun, is it? Come on, just a little to the left!
Lloyd::: Oh no you don't! You don't get away that easy!
Jay::: What are you doing?
Lloyd::: I have an idea!
Kai::: Whoa. What do we have here?
Okino::: A Red Visor.
Nya::: Looks like it's a robot.
Lloyd::: Maybe we could learn something from it.
Jay::: Uh, I don't know, it looks pretty banged up.
Lloyd::: Nya, can you take a look? See if you can do something?
Nya::: It's a computer code. Let's see. Oh, oops, didn't want that. Hang on. Here we go. Rebooting communications.
Red Visor::: Unit RV12 da-da-dash 99 communication o-o-online.
Nya::: Go ahead. Ask him whatever you want.
Lloyd::: Tell us about the Energy cubes. What is Unagami doing with them?
Red Visor::: Energy cubes are used to construct co-o-onstruct the device.
Lloyd::: What device? What does it do?
Red Visor::: The device is- to the other o-other-
Jay::: The other what?
Nya::: Repeat.
Red Visor::: The portal p-portal to the other place.
Cole::: Other place? What other place?
Jay::: To Ninjago! Unagami is building a portal into the real world!
Nya::: Is that true? Confirm.
Kai:::Aw, great!
Lloyd::: We're not getting anymore out of it.
Okino::: My friends, you should go, before more of them come.
Lloyd::: Aren't you coming with us?
Okino::: It is better if I stay.
Nya::: What? Why?
Okino::: You told me, Unagami created Prime Empire. I am part of that. Part of the game.
Lloyd::: Okino, no. Listen-
Okino::: If I was created by Unagami, how can I be trusted? Perhaps I serve him.
Lloyd::: You don't serve Unagami. You make your own choices, Okino.
Jay::: Yeah! We trust you dude!
Okino::: How can you be certain? What if... what if I betray you?
Cole::: You saved our lives, Okino. We trust you.
Lloyd::: Unagami may have made Prime Empire. Maybe even you. But he can't force you to do anything you don't want to. You have a choice, Okino. You decide what you are, and what you do.
Okino::: Then... we will go together.
Lloyd::: Together.
