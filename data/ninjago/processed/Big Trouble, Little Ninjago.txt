Officer::: It's not safe to be out. Please, return to your homes.
Gayle:::The mayor has placed a city-wide curfew until further notice. Tensions are high, as the question on everyone's mind is where are our Green Ninja okay?
Wu::: Lloyd. 
Misako::: Not now, sweetie.
Wu::: Lloyd. Lloyd!
Misako::: What are you drawing? What is it? 
Nya::: Misako.
Misako::: Is my son okay?
Nya::: We found him.But he's in really bad shape. We're headed your way but...but we don't know what to do. It's like...it's like his life force is fading.
Wu::: Lloyd. Help. 
Misako::: I know where to take him.
Man #1::: We're good people. We have nothing to give you.
Man #1::: We will never kneel. Our people have already taken up arms. We will fight, if need be.
Garmadon::: Taken up arms?
Harumi::: These people know not of your power, my Emperor. Show them. Show all of Ninjago how to kneel. 
Man #1:::Please, forgive us, Emperor Garmadon.
Lloyd::: Oh. I c—There's—He's too-He's too much. I can't—please.
Jay::: Hurry. He's burning up.
Mystake::: You cannot hurry tea. Only have patience to get it right. It is ready.
Cole::: Is it going to make him better?
Mystake::: It will heal his wounds, but...
Nya::: But what?
Kai:::There's always a "but."
Mystake::: It comes with a price.
Zane::: Whatever it is, we will pay it.
Mystake::: I will take no coin for this. I speak of a price for you and your friend. Each of you must lay your hand upon him. The tea will focus your Elemental Powers to save him. But it may use up all the power you have left.
Jay::: Are you telling me to save him, we could lose our power?
Mystake::: Perhaps. Perhaps not.
Nya::: Do it.
Kai::: Wait! You don't just jump into decisions like this. I mean—
Cole::: You're just worried about yourself.
Kai::: Maybe I am. But you saw how powerful Lord Garmadon was. Without our Elemental Powers, what chance do we have?
Zane::: The decision needs to be unanimous. I will give up my power to save Lloyd.
Jay::: Me too.
Cole::: It's not even a choice. 
Mystake::: Now we wait. 
Nya::: So at least we have our powers.
Kai::: Yeah. But is it enough?
Nya::: It always is.
Kai::: but what if it's not?
Nya::: Ninja never quit.
Kai::: Ninja don't last forever.
Nya::: Whatever happens, we fight on.
Jay:::Ugh. What possibly could be so important that you have to do that now?
Mystake::: Just a little something— to go. 
Cole::: What is this, takeout?
Mystake::: For your time of need. Remember, to go.
Jay::: to go. 
Mystake::: To go. 
Cole::: What is that? 
Kai::: What is it? What happened?
Man #2::: If you see it, run! 
Jay::: What could do that?
Zane::: Only a being of great size. 
Kai::: Come on!
Nya::: What about Lloyd?
Cole::: Looks like it's just us five.
Nya::: You guys go. I'll keep watch over him. 
Zane::: We need to stop it before anyone is hurt.
Kai::: We're losing it!
Commissioner::: Give it everything we've got!
Jay::: Sweet Garmageddon! 
Commissioner::: W-what happened?
Harumi::: i believe you mean "what happens next?"
Garmadon::: Kneel! Or I will raze your city back into the dust from which it came.
Kai::: Not so fast!
Jay::: "Not so fast?" That's our big entrance? You used that ages ago. After all these battles, all this time, you couldn't come up with something better?
Kai::: Look, I'm sorry if I'm distracted by that giant walking thing!
Cole::: Uh, guys. I think he heard you. 
Jay::: Whoa! No, no, no, no, no, no! Whoa! Whoa!Thanks.
Kai:::Oh, sorry. We totally should've knocked.
Jay:::He really doesn't like us now.
Harumi::: They are no match for you. Their resistance will fail.
Lloyd::: Father!
Mystake::: It actually worked! Eh. That's a first.
Nya::: Lloyd, what is it?
Lloyd::: I had a dream o-of a giant, and my father. He's looking for Wu.
Mystake::: That is no dream. That is a vision.
Nya::: Do you still have your power?
Lloyd:::I don't understand. I-I can't. Why can't I?
Nya::: You're alive. That's all you need to know.
Mystake::: You need to get to the child before it's too late.
Lloyd::: But without my power, I'm...I'm not the Green Ninja.
Nya::: Don't say that.
Lloyd::: My father's still out there. I can't...I can't defeat him.
Nya::: We need to fight on.Do you have any strength left? 
Mystake::: Wait! Here. Take this with you.You may not have power, but that was never what made you powerful. It was knowing what to do, and when to do it.
Nya::: We need to hurry. They're not far.
Mystake::: Now go, ninja, go! The end is not the end, but only a new beginning!
Zane::: We're no match for it.
Jay::: Of all the big things we've fought, this is the biggest!
Cole::: We need the Bounty!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Go! I'll keep it busy.
Harumi::: What is it?
Garmadon::: My brother. He's near.
Wu::: My brother is coming.
Misako::: How do you know?
Wu::: I know.
Misako::: Come on. We have to go.What has happened to you? 
Wu::: Lloyd!
Nya::: Go, Lloyd! Get him outta here!
Misako::: We can hold him back.
Nya::: You sure you're up for this?
Misako::: I was married to him once. I'm up for anything. 
Nya::: Misako! Get down! 
Lloyd::: This way!
Harumi::: Running will do you no good. Give us the child.
Lloyd::: Is this what you want? To destroy the city, create more victims? Just think how many others will be made like you. This isn't what you want.
Harumi::: Oh, no. This is just the beginning.Where are your powers, Lloyd, as your city falls?
Lloyd::: Hold on.
Harumi::: The Sons of Garmadon could always use one more. Join us.
Lloyd::: Yeah, that never works.I have Wu. Can any of you hear me? Where is everyone?
Kai::: We hear you loud and clear! 
Cole::: Jump!
Lloyd::: It's too far!
Jay::: Get us closer!
Zane::: She's as close as I can get her!
Kai::: Careful!
Zane::: Are you actually doubting my ability to closely approximate the true value of our surroundings? I'm a Nindroid.
Harumi:::Give me the child. The Emperor wants his brother.
Kai::: Lloyd, jump! You can make it! 
Lloyd::: Catch him!
Cole::: What? No! 
Kai::: We have to go back.
Zane::: I'll circle around.
Harumi::: You shouldn't have done that!
Lloyd::: No!
Harumi::: This is the end, Lloyd. Watch to see how you lose it all.
Jay::: Hands off, you big oaf! We just had her repaired!
Kai::: What do we do?
Cole::: I don't know!
Zane::: I can't break free from its hold!
Wu::: We have to go!
Cole::: What do you think we're trying to do?
Wu::: We have to go!
Jay::: To go. "For when your time of need, tea to go."I think this is why she gave us this!
Kai::: Well, what are you waiting for? 
Wu::: Go!
Cole::: Go where?
Jay::: I feel funny.
Kai::: What's happening? 
Lloyd::: No!
Harumi::: This. This is what I wanted. To see your father's return, and for you to lose everything. How does it feel to see the end?
Lloyd::: No. I won't let it do to me what it did to you. This isn't the end, Harumi. This is just the beginning. Without my power, without my friends, I'm gonna fight you. I'm gonna fight on. Because a ninja never quits.
Harumi::: Well then, goodbye, Lloyd.
Lloyd::: Before I go, just answer me this: you said the greatest villain was the one who got away. Then what am I? 
Garmadon::: Ninjago is mine.
Zane::: Traveler's Tea.
Cole::: Looks like we're no longer in Ninjago.
Jay::: Then where are we? 
Kai::: Back where it all began. The Realm of Oni and Dragons.
