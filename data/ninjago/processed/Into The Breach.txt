Cole::: How far, Nya?
Nya::: We're going as fast as we can, but this ship needs some fine tuning for sure.
Garmadon:::Hmm.
Jay:::Aalgh!Am I the only one freaking out about this?
Kai:::Why freak out? Our derange, psychotic, arch-nemesis is now our house guest.
Zane::: I find the term "freak out" inadequate and imprecise. I prefer to say I am deeply troubled.
Nya:::Lloyd? Are you sure he can be trusted?
Lloyd::: No. Of course not.
Jay:::Of course not?! That's not what you're supposed to say. You're supposed to say "yes."
Lloyd::: What choice do we have? If Master Wu is right, and we're under attack by the Oni, then my father may be our best chance. And anyway, he doesn't have his powers back, so how much trouble can he really cause?
Zane::: Did he just turn off the—
Kai:::Oh, great.
Ninja:::Ahhh!!
Jay::: He shut off the engines! We're gonna crash!
Nya::: Zane, the emission switch! Hit the emission switch!
Jay::: Ah! I can see the ground! It's getting really close, really fast! 
Ninja::: 
Garmadon::: Hmm. That button should be labeled.
Nya:::Ugh! It is labeled! It says "Don't push while in motion!" 
Zane::: Perhaps it would be wise to accompany your father, Lloyd, to prevent further... mishaps.
Lloyd:::Ugh, I can't believe I have to babysit my own father. 
Garmadon:::Where does this go?
Lloyd::: Nowhere. That's a closet. 
Garmadon:::And this one? 
Lloyd:::That's our sleeping quarters.
Garmadon::: This is where you sleep? In this tiny... compartment?
Lloyd::: It's not a compartment, it's a cabinet. We're on a ship, remember?
Garmadon:::And what are these?
Lloyd::: Just pictures.
Garmadon::: Do they celebrate some conquest, or victory?
Lloyd::: No, they're just pictures.You know, memories, good times. 
Garmadon:::Who is that?
Lloyd:::That's you.Don't you remember?Wha—Hey!
Garmadon::: Sentimentality is a weakness. If you wish to defeat the Oni, you would do well to banish such feelings. 
Lloyd:::Fine.I didn't like that picture anyway. 
Kai:::So? Did you pop the question yet?
Jay::: No, I'm waiting for the right time.
Kai::: There may not be a right time, Jay. You gotta just do it.
Cole:::Do what?
Kai::: Jay's gonna ask Nya to be his Yang.
Cole::: What?! Seriously?!That's great! Why am I always the last person to know these things?
Jay::: Shh! Will you keep your voice down, please?
Kai::: He's been planning it for weeks.
Cole::: Weeks? Haha! You gotta just do it, Jay. It's like ripping off an old bandage. The sooner you get over it, the better. 
Jay::: Um, did you just compare Nya to an old bandage? 
Kai::: Nice. Way to go, Cole.Way to take the romance out of it.
Zane:::All hands to the bridge. 
Garmadon::: Ahem.The Oni entered this realm through a theirs. There are only one or two ways this is possible. And, I'm willing to wager, it would've been through the darkness from spreading, the crystal must be destroyed.
Zane:::The Realm Crystal is currently housed in the new high-security vault, below Borg Tower.
Nya::: That's smack in the middle of Ninjago City!
Kai::: Uh, we just escaped from there, remember? It's engulfed in a giant, black cloud of destruction, and now you're asking us to turn around and go back?
Garmadon::: I asked nothing. I am telling you that if you wish to stop the darkness, the crystal must be destroyed.
Cole::: And I'm telling you, forget it. Just one of those black cloud tentacle things touched my foot for a second, and nearly froze me solid. We wouldn't last a minute inside the darkness.
Garmadon::: That is correct. You are merely human. I, however, am Oni. I can enter the darkness, make my way to the crystal, and destroy it. I will of course, require a weapon.
Cole::: Ha! Fat chance!
Lloyd::: Do you really expect us to just hand you a sword and let you go?
Garmadon::: If you wish to live, yes.
Lloyd::: Well, forget it! No way! I wouldn't trust you with a-a-a—
Kai::: A pillow.It's the most harmless thing I could think of.
Lloyd:::It's not going to happen. You're not going anywhere, not without me. I'm your son, remember?I'm Oni, too.
Garmadon::: No.You are part Oni. That means you might survive.
Lloyd::: Well, I guess we'll find out. 
Jay:::Wow. Will you look at that?
Nya::: Yeah. Pretty creepy, huh?
Jay::: Yeah. But also kind of beautiful in a weird way, isn't it?
Nya::: What are you talking about?No, it's just creepy.
Jay::: Well, I just meant the-the colors and clouds or not. Never mind.It's times like these, you realize what's really important in life.
Nya:::I guess.
Jay:::So, um, Nya, I've been wanting to ask you something for... a long while.
Nya::: Okay.
Jay:::Ehem. Eh-eh-hem.
Nya::: You okay?
Jay::: Yeah, ehem, yeah.Yah! 
Nya::: What do you want?
Garmadon::: Absolutely nothing. 
Nya::: That guy gives me the creeps.What were you gonna say?
Jay::: Uh.It can wait.
Zane:::This will allow us to see what is happening inside the cloud.
Kai::: You sure you want to do this, Lloyd?
Lloyd::: I'll be fine. Don't worry.
Garmadon::: That assumption is unfounded. You are mostly human, that side of you is weak.
Lloyd::: It's also stubborn. Let's go. Give him a sword, Cole. 
Garmadon:::Hmm.
Cole::: Uhh, you sure about that? 
Garmadon:::Hi-yAH!
Kai:::Look out!
Cole:::Agghh! 
Nya:::Ha-yah!Unh!
P.I.X.A.L.:::Unh. 
Cole:::Try that again.Now that I'm ready.
Garmadon:::Hmm. That's better. 
Cole::: Okay, what the heck was that?
Lloyd::: Conflict fuels him.
Zane::: He was powering up.
Jay::: He did that just to get his powers back?!
Cole:::I. Do. Not. Trust. Him!
Nya::: Lloyd, are you sure you want to go through with this?
Lloyd:::No. But I don't really have a choice. 
Nya::: Lloyd! 
Zane::: The camera beam. Come on!He opened his parachute.
Nya:::What are those?
Kai::: They look like... tentacles.
Cole:::Ulgh. That's one of the things that grabbed my foot. Ewulgh. It was terrible.
Nya::: Oh, no! 
Cole::: We have to get him out of there.
Zane::: Wait.Look!
Nya:::He's okay. 
Lloyd:::I-I'm okay.
Garmadon::: Hmm. That was foolish. You are fortunate to have survived.
Lloyd::: Like you care.
Lloyd:::Oh, no! Dr. Borg! Can you hear me? Cyrus!
Nya::: Oh, Pix.It's your father.
Garmadon::: He has fallen into darkness.
Lloyd::: What does that mean?Is he still alive?
Garmadon::: Yes, but in a deep slumber. Nothing you do will wake him.
Lloyd::: Well, there has to be something. He's my friend.Grab his legs.
Garmadon:::What?
Lloyd::: Grab his legs, I'll get his arms. If we can get him back to the temple, maybe Wu can get him a potion or something.
Garmadon:::Only the destruction of the Realm Crystal can save him now.
Lloyd::: Hey.Hey!Ninja don't leave friends behind.
Garmadon::: First, I am not a ninja. Second, I'm not a fool. And third, there are Oni out there, and we won't have a chance against them, if we're dragging a friend along like a human suitcase! So, you better decide, do you want to win or claim to your foolish ideals and perish? 
Lloyd:::If you can hear me, we're going to fix this. I promise. 
Vinny::: Mayday. Mayday! Anyone out there? Anyone?!We're stuck on the 23rd floor of the NGTV news building. If anyone can hear me, please respond.Anyone? Anyone at all? 
Gayle::: Vinny? You still messing with that radio? We got a broadcast in ten minutes.
Vinny::: Uh, boss, I don't think anyone else is out there.I think we might be the last people in the whole city.
Gayle::: The news never sleeps, Vinny. Come on. 
Vinny::: You're right, Miss Gossip. Be right there. Anyone is out there?Anyone can hear me?
Zane::: Come in.
Vinny:::Vinny Folson...
Zane::: Come in. We hear you.
Vinny:::... NGTV news, signing off. 
Kai::: What was that?
Zane::: I believe it was a distress call, but we have lost the audio.
Cole::: Can you trace the signal?
Zane::: I will attempt to triangulate the source.There! Several miles east of us. It appears to be a television station in the outskirts of Ninjago City.
Cole::: Maybe some people who didn't evacuate in time.
Kai::: We got to help them.
Jay::: What about Lloyd? We can't just abandon him.
Nya::: If someone's in trouble, Lloyd would be the first person to tell us to help.
Zane::: That may be, but Lloyd would be incorrect. There's literally nothing more imperative than the success of his mission. If he fails, all of Ninjago is lost.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Perhaps-perhaps there is a way to be in more places than one. I can remain behind in the Samurai X Mech, while you take the Bounty and investigate the distress call.
Nya::: What if you run out of fuel?
P.I.X.A.L.::: That would not be good. Let us hope you are back before that happens. 
Zane:::We will be back. 
Nya:::She'll be okay. 
Lloyd:::Uh, oh.
Garmadon:::Oni. 
Lloyd::: What do we do? Maybe we can sneak around behind them, or find a manhole, or some—
Garmadon::: I have a plan. Follow me.Uh, greetings, Brother Oni. How are you? Love what you've done with the place.Now! (Leaps at the Oni, pulling out his sword. Runs, trying to slice the darkness.
Lloyd::: You-you saved my life.
Garmadon:::Again, your sentiment clouds your judgement. The Realm Crystal is all that matters. Two of us stand a better chance of victory than one.
Lloyd:::Fine. I don't care either. We work together until this is done, and then you go back to your jail cell.What?
Garmadon::: What, what?
Lloyd::: Why are you smiling like that?
Garmadon::: Maybe I'm happy.
Lloyd::: That's not a happy smile. That's an evil, I've-got-something-up-my-sleeve smile.
Garmadon::: Really? How's this? 
Lloyd::: That's exactly the same.
Garmadon::: No, it isn't.
Lloyd::: Yes, it is.
Garmadon::: No, it isn't!Shall we continue? (Turns and walks in, with Lloyd behind him.
Garmadon::: Ah-ah-ah. Power before youth.Follow the darkness.
Zane:::He must be nearing the source of the darkness. The Realm Crystal seems to be interfering with the signal. 
Garmadon:::This is it. 
Jay:::There it is! Destroy it! Quick!
Zane::: He cannot hear you.
Garmadon:::Hmm.Hi-yah!Ahhh!!
Lloyd:::What's that?
Garmadon::: Whatever it is, it's about to experience my full wrath.HI-YAH!! 
Kai:::Zane! How do we get the signal back?
Zane::: The signal is lost, Kai.
Lloyd:::Who are y-you?
Oni::: I am the Omega! The Destructor! The Bringer of Doom!Are you the protectors of this realm?
Lloyd:::Yes. I am.
The Omega:::And you?
Garmadon::: Usually, no, but well today... yes!
The Omega::: You are an Oni.Yet, you fight to preserve this realm.Why?
Garmadon:::If anyone is going to destroy Ninjago, it'll be me, not some Oni usurper with a walking stick. 
The Omega::: Then perish with them!
