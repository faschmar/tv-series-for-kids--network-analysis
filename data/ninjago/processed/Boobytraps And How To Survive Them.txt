Gayle::: This is Gayle Gossip from the desert, where a mysterious pyramid has been discovered. What's inside? Nobody knows. But at this moment, the ninja have arrived and are preparing to enter the pyramid with famed explorer, Clutch Powers.
Zane:::Your assistance will be very helpful.
Lloyd::: But nobody knows what's inside. There could be valuable historical relics.
Kai::: Treasures!
Jay::: Gold!And diamonds!
Zane::: You are the foremost expert on ancient structures and your book, Booby Traps and How to Survive Them, is considered a seminal work.
Clutch::: Flattered! But still no.
Nya::: Professor, isn't there anything we can do to convince you?
Dwayne::: Professor Powers! There's a call for you! 
Clutch::: Now, Dwayne. I told you I didn't want to be disturbed.
Dwayne::: But it's...The Explorer's Club!
Clutch:::W-What? Give me that!Ahem. This is Professor Powers.
Cecil Putnam::: Professor Powers, Cecil Putnam at the Explorer's Club. I regret to inform you, sir, your membership is being revoked.
Clutch::: What? This is an outrage! I demand an explanation! 
Cecil::: Of course. The club's exploration clause requires all members to explore. You, sir, have not explored in over 10 years.
Clutch::: I just discovered a pyramid!
Cecil::: But you have not explored it. And as we are not the discovery club, I'm afraid I can't count that.Sir?Are you there?
Clutch::: Yes, yes, I'm here! And don't cancel anything! I'll get back to you.Ugh. Well guys, looks like you're in luck. Clutch Powers is open for business.Now before we take another step, I hope each of you has read my book. It could save your life.
Zane::: Of course!
Kai::: Yeah! I love...that book. 
Ninja::: Woah!
Clutch::: Chapter Eight: Rickety Old Bridges.Only one way to cross them: fast and first.Last person in line usually doesn't make it!
Kai::: Augh!
Jay::: That wasn't so bad!
Cole::: Huh! It was actually pretty sturdy!
Clutch::: Yeah, we got lucky. But luck runs out.
Clutch::: Don't!
Jay:::Did you see that?
Cole::: See what?
Clutch::: I don't like the look of these.
Kai::: Uh. They're cobwebs.
Clutch::: Yeah, well, that's what they want us to think! Jump over, like this!Guh!
Jay::: Ah!
Clutch::: Gumdrops!
Lloyd::: Grab onto something!
Kai::: I'm trying!
Jay::: There's nothing to grab, it's too smooth!
Cole::: Guys, guys, GUYS!
Kai::: I got this!
Cole:::He said to step over them!
Jay::: I did!
Cole::: If you did, we wouldn't be lying here in a pit with... What? What are you guys staring at?Ah!
Zane::: I wonder who that was.
Kai::: Someone who didn't stop in time.
Clutch::: Hmm...Hageman. A competitor. He was good. Very good. But, he didn't read my book. And it cost him his life.
Zane::: Actually, he did read it.
Clutch::: Now, let me see that!Aha! He stopped on chapter eight. Cobweb traps are in chapter nine. 
Kai::: Wow! Would you look at that!
Clutch::: Nobody touch nothing.Gumdrops.
Lloyd::: Cole?
Cole::: I got this.Any. Day. Now!
Lloyd::: What...is this?
Zane:::It appears to be an ancient locking mechanism. If the image is properly assembled, the chamber will open.
Jay::: Ooh! Like a puzzle game! Oh-ho! I'm good at these!Hmm...
Nya::: Slide that one over there.
Jay::: Oh. Yeah.
Nya::: Wait, wait, wait. What about.. this!
Jay::: No, that's not right.
Nya::: Try this one.
Jay::: Oh. Yeah!
Lloyd::: What does it say?
Zane::: "Beware, ye who enter the serpent's tomb.""For her anger nearly did consume"...."all foolish boy"...."with a staff of power""her evil did destroy."
Lloyd::: What does that mean?
Clutch::: Gobbledygook, who knows? I haven't met and inscription yet that made a lick of sense. I just ignore them.
Zane:::No! Don't!
Serpentine::: Free at least.
Lloyd::: Ugh.
Serpentine::: Where is he?
Lloyd::: Who?
Serpentine::: The Treacherous Deceiver. The one who imprisoned me. Tell me where he is!Â  And I, Aspheera, will show you mercy.
Zane::: I believe she's looking for the boy mentioned in the hieroglyphics.
Lloyd::: What do I tell her?
Nya::: Tell her the truth. We don't know!
Lloyd::: Umm...That was a while ago.
Jay:::Let her have it! 
Clutch::: Uh. I'll get help. 
Aspheera:::You! You're a fire Elemental?
Kai::: Yeah! And the name's Kai! 
Aspheera:::Your fire warms me. For too long I have been trapped in this cold, dark place. I will take your fire!
Kai::: Oh, yeah?
Kai::: Ah! Ah! Argh! Ah. Ah...
Nya::: Kai!
Cole::: What's happening?!
Zane::: She's stealing his Elemental Powers! We must stop her!
Ninja except Kai::: Ninja-go! 
Zane::: Woah!
Cole::: Ah!
Nya::: Wah!
Lloyd::: Ugh!
Jay::: Oof!
Lloyd::: She knows Spinjitzu.
Jay::: How?!
Lloyd::: Kai!
Aspheera::: I thank you, Elemental. In return for your gift, I shall spare your lives.May you enjoy your time in this place as much as I did. Farewell! 
Lloyd::: You won't get away with this!
Clutch:::I made it! I'm alive! Oh, I gotta tell someone what happened.
Aspheera::: You!
Clutch:::Gumdrops!
Aspheera::: Take me to the nearest village.
Clutch::: Village? There's...nothing for hundreds of miles. Nothing...until Ninjago City.
Aspheera::: Take me to Ninjago City.
Clutch::: N-Never!
Clutch:::This is an ancient Minkan Amulet of Protection. Y-You cannot harm me.
Aspheera::: Are you sure?
Clutch::: Yeah, I'm sure! Pretty sure.I hope so. I'd be really bummed if he lied about it.
Aspheera::: Let us find out.
Clutch::: Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah! Woahahaho!No. Please be real! Please be real! Please be-Hohohohoho!
Aspheera:::Take me to Ninjago City. Revenge shall be mine!
