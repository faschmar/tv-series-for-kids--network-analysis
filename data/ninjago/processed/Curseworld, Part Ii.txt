Wu::: Lloyd couldn't destroy the Realm Crystal. The Preeminent has arrived.
Misako::: But where's my son?
Ronin::: We need to evacuate everyone out of this town. Like, now!
Jay::: Whoa!
Kai::: What is that thing?
Zane::: She's the Preeminent. The physical manifestation of the entire Cursed Realm.
Cole::: I know one thing, she ain't pretty.
Jay::: Ew, gross! I'm about to lose my lunch.
Nya::: If we can't stop that, we might lose Ninjago! 
Kai::: Fire!
Jay::: Lightning!
Zane::: Ice!
Cole::: Earth!
Zane::: She didn't notice that.
Jay::: Oh, I hate unbeatable creatures.
Ronin:::Hurry, on board!
Wu::: This way.
Misako::: Look, it's Lloyd!
Ronin::: That's not Lloyd.
Wu::: It's Morro.
Morro:::You were wrong about me, Sensei. You said destiny didn't want me to be the Green Ninja. Well, I make my own destiny. And now yours is coming to an end.
Wu::: You've released this scourge and it won't stop until it has cursed all Sixteen Realms. I trained you to be a ninja who protects, not one who destroys.
Morro::: You made me believe I was to become the Green Ninja. Now I am!
Misako::: Wu!
Wu::: Misako!
Morro::: The more souls the Preeminent takes, the bigger she gets. Say goodbye to your loved ones, and say goodbye to Ninjago!
Ronin::: Warm up that paddle. We're leaving when they get back.
Woman::: Thank you.
Nya::: Get to the ship, hurry!
Zane::: I don't know how to stop this thing! It just keeps coming!
Kai:::Ah, you stop one, two more grow in its place.If there ever was a time to unlock your True Potential, sis, it's now.
Nya::: Let me just flip the switch. Oh yeah, I'm not a Nindroid. I don't have a switch!
Zane::: If Ghosts can't withstand Deepstone, perhaps the same goes for the Preeminent. But we'll need a larger dose.
Cole::: My bike's made of Deepstone. How about I jam it down her gullet? Cover me!
Misako:::Ah. Wu!
Cole::: Like cake? How's this for your pie hole? Ninja, go! 
Misako::: 
Wu:::Got you.
Jay::: Thanks, Cole. You only made her madder.
Cole::: And there goes a perfectly good bike.
Kai::: If Lloyd's inside that thing, we have to get closer!
Jay::: Yeah, easier said than done!
Chen::: Who was that? Was that Lloyd?
Clouse:::You're seeing things again, Master Chen.
Lloyd:::Dad!
Garmadon::: Lloyd?My son.
Lloyd::: I'll get you out of here, Dad. 
Garmadon::: There's no use. These chains will not break.
Lloyd::: Where are we?
Garmadon::: The Cursed Realm is the Preeminent, and the Preeminent is the Cursed Realm. Son, you're in the belly of the beast. But if you're in here...
Lloyd::: Morro is the Green Ninja. And he's stolen the Realm Crystal. I tried, Father...
Garmadon::: You must not give up. If he has the Crystal, all is endangered.
Lloyd::: But how? I'm not the Green Ninja anymore.
Garmadon::: It was never the color of the gi that made you who you are. It was the color of your heart. Don't give up.
Lloyd::: I won't, Father.
Garmadon::: You must leave here and destroy the Preeminent. Save Ninjago. Save the Realms.
Lloyd::: But if I destroy it, it could destroy you.
Garmadon::: Whatever happens to me, wherever I am, I will always be with you. There comes a time when every boy must become a man. What sort of man, is up to him.
Nya::: I thought you were gonna get closer?
Kai::: You don't think I'm trying?
Wu::: It's too late. We have to get to the ship and protect the people.
Jay::: But what about Lloyd?
Misako::: Ugh. This is what Lloyd would've wanted.
Kai::: To the ship, but we're not leaving anyone else behind!
Zane::: Whoa! 
Wu:::Follow me! That's all of them. We need to get this ship to sea to put as much water between us as possible.
Ronin::: No problem.Maybe one problem. 
Cole::: It's Morro!
Jay::: Look out, Ronin!
Kai::: I'll get him. 
Ronin::: Go, get out of here! I got this! 
Nya::: Is this as fast as it goes?
Ship Captain:::It's a paddle steamer, not a rocket ship.
Morro::: What? You again?
Lloyd::: Yeah, I'm back. I believe you have something of mine.Try this!
Jay::: Yeah, all right, Lloyd!
Kai::: Haha!
Wu::: Look! He got his father's robes.
Lloyd::: Ronin, get to the ship and protect the people. Ninja, take out the stilts. We need to drop the Preeminent into the sea.
Jay::: Ugh, why didn't we think of that earlier?
Cole::: That's why he's the leader.
Ninja::: Ninja, go! 
Lloyd::: Let me handle the blowhard.
Morro::: You think you're better than me? No one is better than me! 
Kai::: Let's give that slimeball a bath. 
Morro::: No, they're taking out the supports!
Ninja::: Ninja, go!
Morro::: Noooo!Protect the Preeminent! Protect the Realm!
Soul Archer::: Protect the Preeminent!
Jay::: Just when you thought you've seen it all.
Wu::: Let's hope it can't swim.
Ronin::: We need more speed.
Nya::: I've gotta help the ninja.
Ronin::: Let me. 
Kai::: We have to destroy that thing before it reaches the ship.
Wrayth::: Lift!
Ghoultar::: Throw!
Misako:::It's okay. The ninja will stop it.
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L. has detected over five hundred Ghosts aboard this walking fortress, and the number is climbing.
Cole::: If we have to destroy this thing one ghost at a time, so be it.
Kai::: Aargh! Then I want a front row ticket.Ninja, go! 
Nya::: Hey, guys. Need a hand? 
Cole::: Thanks, Nya.
Wrayth:::Got ya. 
Jay::: Lightning! 
Nya::: Knock, knock!
Kai::: Come on in. Let's rock this house.
Jay::: Doctor, it appears our patient needs to have his knee put on ice.
Zane::: I'm happy to help.
Wu::: Yes! She's unable to follow us to sea! 
Misako::: I thought Ghosts can't stand water. How come it's still after us?
Wu::: Have enough Ghosts at your disposal, I guess you can pretty much do anything. Throw anything we don't need off the ship. We need to go faster! Much faster!
Morro::: You and I could go on fighting forever...or I could just take the Realm Crystal and leave you behind forever! 
Lloyd::: You're not getting away! 
Monk:::No, we must not dabble in their affairs anymore. This is for them to resolve.
Laval::: Hey, where'd you guys come from?
Wu::: Can we go any faster?
Ronin::: It's on full power.
Misako::: Head for that fog bank for cover!
Nya:::Kai, watch out!
Kai:::Aah!
Cole::: I got you!Huh? I guess not.
Kai::: Ugh, no.I can't swim!
Cole::: I can't get wet!
Soul Archer::: You have to come up for air at some time, Fire Ninja. 
Zane::: Kai! Shoot fire now!
Kai::: Fire!
Zane::: Ice! 
Jay::: Yeah! Fire and Ice make water, nice! And one more Ghost is toast.
Zane::: As iron sharpens iron...
Kai::: Brother sharpens brother.
Kai::: Aw, are you kidding me? Even our coolest moves aren't helping anything.
Nya::: We obviously aren't doing any good here. We need to protect the ship.
Jay::: Ladies first.
Nya::: Ninja, go! 
Wu::: If we're gonna destroy the Preeminent, we're gonna have to do more.
Ronin::: Speaking of more, we need more fuel. If we turn back now, we'll have just enough to get us to shore. Otherwise, if we reach Hollow's Trench, we'll be sitting ducks out there.
Kai::: Hollow's Trench. Do you think it's deep enough to drown that giant thing?
Wu::: One way to find out. Full steamer ahead!
Cole::: Oh, no!
Morro:::I did it. I finally got rid of you!
Wu:::Until you embrace what holds you back, you'll never discover your True Potential. Your weakness is you give up too easily. You only like what comes easy. Don't be afraid to fail, Nya. 
Jay::: Morro?
Cole::: Not Morro, Nya!
Kai::: She's unlocked her True Potential!
Morro::: Nooooo!Nooo!
Wu::: Take my hand!
Morro::: Why? So you can take the Realm Crystal and use it to find your own prized pupil?
Wu::: You are all my prized pupils, but none of us can do this alone. You're strong, Morro, but it takes others to make us stronger. Even me. Take my hand, so we can be stronger together. Please, Morro!
Morro:::You can only save those who want to be saved. Goodbye, Sensei. 
Wu::: Morro! 
Kai::: Haha, all right!
Jay::: Whoo, haha!
Misako::: Lloyd, you made it!
Lloyd::: And so did you.
Zane::: Good to have you back. You just missedâ€”
Lloyd::: Oh, I know what I missed. I caught a glimpse of what would happen next,and knew Morro had to return alone. Just 'cause I'm the Green Ninja, doesn't mean I have to save the day. Especially when I have friends to rely on.
Misako::: And that's why destiny chose you.
Wu::: It appears your father's robe has imparted wisdom, but you still have a lot to master to earn the Sensei title.
Lloyd::: If that's the path I'm on, I'll take it one step at a time. The Cursed Realm is gone...and so is my father...but I know we're all in a better place.
Cole::: Some of us may look a little different, but like our team, some things never change.
Nya::: And if they do... that's okay. Sometimes, we just need to go with the flow.
Kai::: 'Cause even if the path isn't always straight, we go forward, with confidence, because we trust where we're headed.
Jay::: Yeah, and speaking of where we're headed, I've been dying to know. What are the other Realms like, Lloyd? C'mon, spill it. We have to know what we're saving, right?
Lloyd::: Let's just say, the future looks bright. For us, and for Ninjago.
