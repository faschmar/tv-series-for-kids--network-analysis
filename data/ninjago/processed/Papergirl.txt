Sammy::: Hey, listen up. Announcements. Oh, what do you know? All the routes are open. That's a first. But uh, Spokes and Knuckles are still on trauma leave, and Jonesy's bike is in the shop, so we're a couple of hands short. Oh, and uh, this is Antonia's last day, so get your goodbyes in.
Leroy::: What?
Paperboy 2::: He's joking. Right, Ton?
Nelson::: Yeah, Antonia ain't a quitter.
Antonia::: It ain't a joke. I got something new lined up. What'd you think, I was gonna be a papergirl my whole life? I got a job at the Dairy Dragon.
Leroy::: That ice cream shop downtown?
Paperboy 2::: They got great ice cream.
Sammy::: All right, come on. Stow the jabber and hit the road. These papers ain't delivering themselves!
Nelson::: Antonia? You can't quit! You're the one who taught me that the news never sleeps, remember?
Antonia::: Maybe not, but I woke up. I'm gonna make more off the tip jar of Dairy Dragon than I will all week here. 
Nelson::: Hey, wait! Antonia!Antonia! Wait up! Antonia! What about all that stuff you said, about how the news is so important? How we're making a difference?
Antonia::: I was wrong, okay? Look around! Every day gets crazier. If it ain't giant snakes, it's a dragon or some evil video game. 
Nelson::: There's nothing today. Everything's fine! See? 
Gripe::: In the name of King Kalmaar of Merlopia, surrender and perish!
Policeman 1::: Uh, did he say surrender and perish?
Jimmy::: That's not much of a choice.
Nelson::: So it's not perfect. But that doesn't mean we give up!
Antonia::: If we're not making a difference, what's the point? Might as well take a job that pays better.
Nelson::: It's about not giving up, even when you lose.
Antonia::: Who told you that piece of cheerful advice?
Nelson::: It's true!
Antonia::: Well, I have my own saying. If you can't win, quit and join the Dairy Dragon.
Nelson::: What flavors do they have at the Dairy Dragon?
Antonia::: Chocolate fudge, butter pecan, mint chocolate chip, ninjapolitan, Bananakhan, cookies and cream, Spinjitzu Swirl, vanilla, Mango Morro, and orange sorbentine.
Nelson::: I love Banadakhan. What am I talking about? You're quitting, Antonia. That's it. Plain and simple.
Antonia::: Yeah, I know. We just talked about that through the whole merman invasion back there. And you know what? I'm okay with quitting.
Nelson::: Well, if that's how you feel, I guess there's nothing I can say. 
Antonia::: Hey, come on. Nelson! Don't be like that. Ugh.Nelson, will you listen? You're gonna be fine without me. Hey, come on. Did you think about the upside?
Nelson::: What upside?
Antonia::: Having a friend at the Dairy Dragon, I can hook you up with all the Banadakhan you can imagine! What do you say? Still friends?
Nelson::: Yeah, I guess. Still
Kai::: Hey, Tentacles! 
Cole::: Master Wu! Ninja, go! 
Ray::: Kai!Ouch. Oh man. I don't remember it hurting this much.
Kai::: Ugh, me neither.
Kalmaar:::You! Girl! Bring me that amulet, now!
Kai::: Don'tlet him get it, kid!
Wu::: Go, kids. Go!
Nelson::: Who are those guys?
Antonia::: Beats me! I ain't sticking around to find out!
Kalmaar::: I believe you have something that belongs to me. Hand it over, or face the consequences.
Antonia::: See? This is what you get for sticking your neck out. Now what are we supposed to do?
Nelson:::All right. Come on!
Antonia::: I'm really regretting I taught you this stuff!
Nelson::: Too late to worry about it now. 
Kalmaar::: Stop them!
Nelson::: Oh no! 
Kalmaar::: I quite dislike that child.Well, you're a tricky beast, aren't you? There we go.
Nelson::: You've got to be kidding me!
Antonia::: This way!
Kai::: Remember me?
Kalmaar::: Of course I remember you, I saw you just five minutes ago in the street!
Kai::: That was sarcasm, which I guess they don't have wherever you're from!
Nelson::: What do we do?
Antonia::: Maybe I should
Kalmaar::: What is your name?
Antonia::: Antonia.
Kalmaar::: Are you, a ninja?
Antonia::: No.
Kalmaar::: An Elemental Master?
Antonia::: Nope.
Kalmaar::: A mystic?
Antonia::: Uh uh.
Kalmaar::: An Oni?
Antonia::: Not even close.
Kalmaar::: Serpentine?
Antonia::: Ew.
Kalmaar::: Vermillion?
Antonia::: No, II'm just a papergirl.
Kalmaar::: Paper, girl?
Nelson::: We deliver newspapers?
Kalmaar::: A papergirl! Oh, how amusing! 
Antonia::: What's so funny?
Kalmaar::: Of all my foes, of all those who have tried to stop me, you, a common papergirl, came the closest. Perhaps I have underestimated your loathsome species. 
Nelson::: Kai's still down there!Come on, Antonia!Antonia!
Antonia::: He's not breathing.
Nelson::: Okay. Step back, Antonia. I know CPR. 
Wu::: Kai, what happened? Are you okay?
Kai::: I'm fine. But Tentacles, hehe got away.
Nelson::: He went that way.
Antonia::: We tried to stop him. We really did, but we weren't fast enough. He got that round thing. I'm really sorry.
Wu::: Oh, child, you did all you could. And we thank you for it.
Cole::: Yeah. The important thing is you were here.
Kai::: If you hadn't been, I might still be at the bottom of that canal.
Wu::: Come. There isn't a moment to lose. Perhaps we can still catch them. 
Nelson::: Well, so long.
Antonia::: So long.
Nelson::: Good luck at the Dairy Dragon. Maybe I'll swing by tomorrow and 
Antonia::: Oh, save it, Nelson. I'm not going anywhere.I changed my mind, okay? I got a right to change my mind, don't I?
Nelson::: You mean, you're gonna stay?
Antonia::: Yeah. I'm gonna stay. But only if you promise not to rub my nose in it. In fact, don't say anything. Just say "Okay, Antonia. I'll see you tomorrow." 
Nelson::: Okay, Antonia. I'll see you tomorrow.
Antonia::: See you around, purple ninja.
