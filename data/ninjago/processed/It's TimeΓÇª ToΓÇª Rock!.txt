Jay::: It's time for...
Nya::: Ninja Vlog!
Nya::: We're super excited to head back and find out the true secret of the island.
Jay::: Uh...
Nya::: Okay, fine. I'm excited. Jay is still a little scared.
Jay::: Well, I mean, you would be scared too, if you were told every single thing on the island was unfriendly.
Nya::: Jay, I was literally standing right next to you when we were told that.
Jay::: Let's look at the results from last week's LEGO Life meme challenge. I particularly like this one. You see that, Nya? Perfection.
Nya::: Jay, I think that might be sarcasm.
Jay::: No... really?
Nya::: This one is nice. "When Lloyd lets them use his bike again."
Jay::: "But Jay broke it an hour later." Untrue! I would never break it!
Nya::: But this meme still seems fitting.
Jay::: Funny, but it still wasn't me who broke the bike.
Nya::: Well, you did park it in a jungle with a dragon.Speaking of, let's get back to the island!
Jay::: Can't we keep looking at memes, just for another couple... days?
Jay::: Hey! Well, we're on the island, but I think I lost my phone on the journey.
Nya:::Roar!
Jay::: Look out! Look out!
Nya::: Jay, it's only me.
Jay::: I know it's you! There's someone over there!
Nya:::An islander! I knew this place wasn't deserted!
Jay::: We need to be careful.
Nya::: Do we? He just looks like he's gardening.
Jay::: Oh, phew. Okay, he's going away.
Nya::: Ooh, let's follow him.
Jay::: What?! No, no, no, no. No, I'm sorry, there's absolutely no way—
Nya::: We followed him.
Jay::: Yeah, "we followed him".
Nya::: And we found their village!
Jay::: It is amazing.
Nya::: Wow.
Jay::: Whoa.
Nya::: That's incredible.
Jay::: Look, that's our guy. Who's he waving to?
Nya::: Their leader.
Jay::: How can you tell?
Nya::: Just a hunch. Plus, the throne, the crown, the huge amulet. Stuff like that.
Jay::: Hey, look, they're working on those lightning rods.
Nya::: They must have built the catamaran we saw on the beach.
Jay::: Yeah, you know what? These guys don't seem all that unfriendly.
Nya::: Definitely not. I guess, if anything, they're
Jay, Nya::: Protecting something?
Jay::: What's that?
Nya::: Hey, Jay. I think I found your phone.
Jay::: Really? Where?Oh, I'm not getting that back, am I?
Nya:::No.
Nya::: So there we have it. The island deserted after all. Far from it.
Jay::: Those islanders have some of the most exciting tech I've ever seen.
Nya::: But sadly, that's all the time we have for this series.
Jay::: Although, well, we hoped you enjoy watching.
Nya::: And if you have, check out our latest poll on LEGO Life—
Jay::: Whoa.
Nya::: —asking you about your favorite Ninja Vlog moments.
Jay::: Oh, and while you're there, you'll find a brand new sticker of that awesome islander who found my phone.
Nya::: Thanks so much for watching. Hope to see you again.
Jay, Nya::: Chicken Squad out!
