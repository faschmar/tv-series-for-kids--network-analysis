Lloyd::: Very wise.
Noble::: Yep. The entire wing was built for one purpose... to hold the rottenest egg of all. Well... good luck.See you on the way out.
Lloyd::: Aren't you gonna—Stay?Hmm. Hello, Father.
Garmadon::: Well, well, if it isn't the Green Ninja. To what, do I owe the honor?
Lloyd::: You sent for me, remember? You said it was urgent.
Garmadon::: Did I? Hmm. That doesn't sound like me.I have all the time in the world in here.
Lloyd::: Fine.Then I guess I'll just—
Garmadon::: Oh, yes.I remember now. I did call you. Do you remember the last time we saw each other? What I said?
Past Garmadon::: When they come, nothing will be left.
Lloyd::: You said something was coming.
Garmadon::: Yes, but you didn't listen. And now, I'm afraid there isn't much time.
Lloyd::: Time for what?
Garmadon:::To prepare for the darkness, destruction. The end of Ninjago. And while I'm okay with that, in principle, I'd rather not be destroyed along with you, so I've decided to help you fight them.
Lloyd::: Fight who?
Garmadon::: The Bringers of Doom. You and your color-coded little ninja are no match for them. There's only one thing powerful enough to stop them.
Lloyd::: Let me guess. You.
Garmadon:::Let me out, and you might have a chance.
Lloyd::: Hmm. How do I put this. No. N—O. Not if you were the last person in all of Ninjago. There is nothing you will say that will make me trust you ever again. Goodbye.
Garmadon:::Hmm. You'll be back.
Worker::: That's it. Now take it away. Okay. Easy does it. Easy does it.
Policeman #1:::Let's move this as fast as possible so we can get the traffic going.
Cole:::Oh, come on. You gotta be kidding.
Zane::: We were supposed to be there 30 minutes ago.
P.I.X.A.L.::: This thing has an enormous drill on it. Can we not just go under them?
Cole::: Oh, can we? Please? 
Zane::: I do not think the city would appreciate that. They just finished rebuilding this freeway.
Cole::: Aah. We're so late. And I can see the harbor right there.
P.I.X.A.L.::: That's it. I'm getting out. 
Cole::: Hyah.Hey, guys, wait up. My foot's asleep. 
Dad::: Oh, look, son. It's the ninja!
Kid:::Yeah, right, Dad.
Cole:::Ow.Come on, foot.Coming through.Sorry.Ninja business.
Kid::: Uh, Dad, did-did you see that ninja?
Dad::: He just ducked through our car.
Cole:::Yes, finally.
Policeman #2::: Hey, you can't go over there! The road is closed!
Cole::: Sorry. It's an emergency.
Policeman #2::: Oh. Uh, I didn't know. Never mind. Good luck, guys!
P.I.X.A.L.::: To the harbor as fast as possible.
Zane::: Keep the vehicle velocity within the permitted speed limit of a densely populated area.
Audience::: Hey, look. It's them. They're here. 
Gayle::: Okay, Vinny, on me. In three, two, one. We're live from Ninjago Harbor, where several of the ninja have just arrived to witness the unveiling of a new ship being presented to them as a gift from the mayor.
Commissioner::: Thank you all for coming. Now, I'm not much for speeches, but the mayor asked me to say a few words. Not really sure why the mayor couldn't do this herself. Never around, really. It's a riddle to me how she got elected in the first place. And the funding of the police department is—Ahem. It gives me great pleasure to present this ship from the people of Ninjago City to the ninja, in thanks to their years of dedicated service. 
P.I.X.A.L.::: I wonder what it looks like.
Zane::: Oh. I hope it's a tri-master like the Bounty.
Cole::: Don't get your hopes up. Whatever it is, it won't compare.
Zane::: You're right about that.The Bounty was—
Audience:::Bounty! Bounty!
Zane::: It-It looks just like—
Cole::: It is the Bounty! They rebuilt it!Sir, I-I don't know what to say.
Zane::: You've given us back our ship.
Commissioner::: And you've given us back our city.
Zane::: How did you do it? The Bounty was completely destroyed.
Commissioner::: We were able to obtain a copy of the original blueprints from a private collector.
Rufus::: Who wants them back in mint condition.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I wish the others could see this.
Cole::: Where are they?
Zane::: Jay said he had something important to take care of.
Cole::: What could be more important than this?
Jay:::Nya? I've wanted to ask you this for... a... long time. Um, will you... be my Yang? 
Kai::: No, no, no. You can't ask like that.
Jay::: Why not?
Kai::: You have to ask with confidence. Like this.Hey, Nya, how's it going? I've been thinking... you and me... we make a pretty good pair. So what do you say we make it official?Will you be my Yang?
Jay:::Yes.
Kai::: See?
Jay::: Wait, no. I can't ask like that. It doesn't feel right. It feels too... I don't know—cocky.
Dareth:::Who's cocky?
Kai::: Nobody. Jay's trying to find the right way to ask Nya to be his Yang.
Dareth::: Seriously? You and Nya? Wow.
Jay::: Aw. Kai, do you mind?
Kai::: Oh. Sorry. It's supposed to be secret, so don't tell anyone.
Dareth::: The Yin-Yang promise is a beautiful and sacred tradition, Jay. Congratulations. Ah! I'm so excited to be part of it. I-I am part of it, right?
Jay::: Yes, Dareth.
Kai::: If he ever asks Nya.
Nya:::Ask me what? 
Jay:::Um.Ask you where you got that shirt—haha—because it's awesome. I want one.
Nya::: It's a kimono, Jay. A traditional gown worn by women?
Jay::: Uh, guys can wear them, too.
Dareth::: Ooh, I would look so good in a kimono. 
Kai::: Uh, so, where's Master Wu?
Nya::: In the courtyard, supervising the new mural.
Dareth::: Ooh, ooh, I wanna see.
Jay::: Wow.
Kai::: Will ya look at that.
Wu::: It is the history of Ninjago, a history in which all of you played a significant role.
Past Kai:::Change anything, change everything.
Past Garmadon:::You want this city, Lloyd? Then you can have it in ruins.
Jay:::Hey, that's us. 
Nya::: And there's Pythor... and Morro!
Dareth:::Where am I?Where am I? I-I'm in here somewhere, right?
Nya::: Oh, I'm sure you are.
Dareth::: Okay, I'll keep looking.Ooh, I think I see me. There's a brown spot here, and it looks just like me. Woohoo! 
Kai::: Huh?What's that?
Jay::: The Tornado of Creation. Don't you remember? We all came together and formed that—that bone-cage thingy.
Kai::: Oh yeah. Ha. Can't believe that worked.
Jay::: Uh, except I don't remember it looking that impressive.
Kai::: Yeah, Master Wu. Are you sure you want to commemorate this moment? I mean, we've had better ones.
Wu::: It is a part of our history. When all hope seemed lost, you confronted destruction with creation.Balance was restored. That is the power of Spinjitzu, which we must always— 
Kai::: Huh?That looked like Firstbourne. 
Jay::: Come on! 
Jay::: Oh, my gosh. Faith! 
Nya::: Are you okay?
Wu::: Faith, what happened? Who did this? 
Jay::: What did she say?
Wu::: She said... a darkness is coming.
Lloyd::: How is she?
Nya::: Will she be okay? 
Wu::: I've given her a powerful healing potion. She will recover. As will Firstbourne, though it will take time.
Cole::: Did she say what happened?
Wu:::She said... a darkness swept over the Realm of Oni and Dragon. She tried to resist it, but it grew and grew, consuming all in its path. Those who were touched by it were frozen where they stood like statues.
Lloyd::: I was at Kryptarium Prison, visiting my father. He said something similar. He said "The darkness is coming."
Jay::: Well, that's creepy. 
Cole::: But what is it? What is the darkness?
Master Wu:::What else did he say?
Lloyd::: Something about "The Bringers of Doom."
Wu:::Bringers of doom.There. That's it.
Cole::: I don't like the look of that.
Kai::: Oh. Me neither. What is it?
Wu::: It is an Oni. My father called them the Bringers of Doom. He feared that they would one day spread out from their realm and cover all the lands of creation in darkness.
Jay:::That's a crazy legend.Good thing it's just a legend, right?
Wu::: Many legends begin in truth. And if there is any truth to this... we must prepare.
Lloyd::: How?
Wu::: We must warn Ninjago City. There isn't a moment to lose. 
Cole::: Good thing we have the Bounty back.
Lloyd:::The Bringers of Doom. 
Watchman #1::: So, what's in all of these rooms?
Watchman #2::: A bunch of stuff they transferred in from the vault in Hiroshi's Labyrinth.
Watchman #1::: Ah. Like what?
Watchman #2::: A lot of dangerous magical artifacts and cursed objects.
Watchman #1::: Why do they bring it here?
Watchman #2::: Because it's safer here. When old man Borg rebuilt this place, he pulled out all the stops, infrared cameras, hypersensitive laser grid. Name it. Nothing and nobody's getting in here.
Watchman #1::: What? What was that?
Watchman #2::: I have no idea.
Watchman #1:::Ah! Ahh!
Watchman #2::: That doesn't look good. Run.Come on, come on, come on. 
Alarm::: Evacuate. Evacuate. Evacuate. 
Cyrus:::Ahh!!
Watchman #2::: Not safe. Not save at all. 
Kai::: No way. Look at this thing.
Nya::: Wow.
Jay::: Whoa.
Kai::: Huh. This looks just like the old Bounty.
Nya::: They did a wonderful job.
Lloyd::: Let's see what she's capable of. Full speed ahead.
Nya::: What was that?
Lloyd::: Forwards, Zane. Not backwards.
Zane:::Someone must have wired the lever wrong. 
Commissioner:::Oh! Darn it. How many times have I told you to knock first, Jimmy?
Jimmy::: Sorry, sir. But we got a serious problem. The phones are ringing off the hook.
Commissioner::: What phones?
Jimmy::: All of them. 
Generic Man::: Just for a second. Did you say black cloud?
Policeman #3::: Um, yes, sir. We'll be sure to send someone there right away.
Policeman #4::: No sir, not approaching. 
Jimmy::: I think something big is happening.
Commissioner:::Here we go again.
People:::Ahhh!!
Woman #1:::Ah!Ahhh!!
People:::Ahhh!!
Man #1:::Ah. Ah. Oh, uh.Ahhh!!!
People:::Ahhh!
Man #2:::Ahhh!
Woman #2:::Ah!Ahhh!!
Old Man::: 
Zane::: Uh, guys? I'm picking up a lot of distress calls on UHF.
Cole::: We're too late.
Lloyd::: Maximum speed.
Nya::: Hold on, everyone.Come on you, unhinged ship. Mmph! 
Commissioner::: Come on. Go, go, go.Don't look back. Don't stop. Just run.Get out of here.
Jimmy::: Uh, sir. It's here. 
Commissioner::: Okay, boys... ... this is why we get paid the big bucks. Draw your weapons.
Policeman::: Uh, sir? Wha—we only have tasers,remember?
Commissioner::: What?
Jimmy::: I don't even have a taser. I just got this thing. 
Commissioner:::Oh, for crying out loud. Fall back! Get out of here. Run! 
Policeman #4:::Where now?
Commissioner::: The alley. Go, go. 
Policeman #5::: Aw, it's a dead end.
Commissioner:::Ach. This isn't my day.
Jimmy::: What do we do?
Commissioner::: Anyone have any bright ideas?Steady, boys. Steady... 
Commissioner::: The ninja.Oh, boy, are we glad to see you guys.
Lloyd::: Commissioner, get your officers out of here. 
Commissioner::: You heard him. Move it. 
Lloyd::: Okay, let's see what this is made of. Care to do the honors, Jay?
Jay::: My pleasure. Lightning. 
Kai::: Uh, heh. Let's see how it likes fire. Fire.What?
Lloyd::: Okay, everybody at the same time.
Kai, Jay, Cole, Zane, and Lloyd::: Nin-ja-go. 
Zane::: Our elemental powers appear to be ineffective.
Kai::: Yeah, no kidding. What do we do?
Lloyd::: Nya, get us out of here.
Nya::: You got it. 
Cole:::Wha—ah. Uh, guys.Help. It's got me.Ahh!Ah.Wha-ah. 
Lloyd:::Yah!Come on, buddy. I got ya. Time to get out of here.Reel us in. Quick.We need to go save some more people.
Jay:::Here. Drink this. It's good for you.
Zane:::Your chance of survival are increased.
Kai::: We hit it with everything we had, and it did nothing. It just went right through it. 
Nya::: How are we supposed to fight something like that?
Cole:::I-I touched it. It was colder than anything I've ever felt. And there was something inside the cloud. I think it was an Oni.
Lloyd::: Maybe we can't fight it. But I know someone who can. 
Garmadon::: Well, well. Look who's back.
Lloyd::: How do we stop it?
Garmadon:::You can't. If you were to enter the darkness, you would succumb to it. The only way to defeat an Oni is with another Oni. You need me.
Jay:::Ha, ha, ha. Like that's gonna happen. Ha, ha. That's not gonna happen, is it?
Lloyd::: What choice do we have? Open cell one. 
Garmadon:::Hahahahaha. Mmhahahaha.
