Jay::: Ugh, vultures. That's never a good sign.
Zane::: They are carrion birds. It is a sign they believe we are a potential meal...
Jay::: Oh, thanks, Zane. Way to boost morale.
Nya::: Can you guys keep it down? I'm trying to reach P.I.X.A.L. on the radio. Come in. P.I.X.A.L.? Can you hear me? Mayday, mayday! Come in, P.I.X.A.L..
Lloyd::: Any luck?
Nya::: Nothing. There's something wrong with the long-range transmitter, but I can't figure out what.
Lloyd::: Okay, well... don't give up.And that's the last of it.
Kai::: That's not good. Less than a day's supply of water.
Cole::: And the ATV and the Dune Bounty are wrecked. And the Rock Cycle isn't fast enough to outrun those beetles!
Kai::: Well, even if it could, it would only carry one of us.
Lloyd::: Maybe Nya could draw some water out of the air?
Cole::: In this heat? Low humidity? I don't think so. 
Kai::: Jay, what are you doing?
Jay::: Carving a message on this rock, so people know who we are when they find our bones.
Lloyd::: Can we try to be a little more optimistic, please?
Zane::: I'm afraid there's little cause for optimism. Our situation is dire. The Bounty 's engine will not start without the Thermolytic Inverter.
Cole::: The therma-what?
Zane::: It is a critical engine component.
Kai::: Well, what's wrong with it?
Zane::: It is missing. I believe Beohernie ripped through the hull.
Jay::: Bernie.
Zane::: He tore that component out and swallowed it.
Jay::: Ugh. Well, that's just great! First, a giant beetle tries to eat us alive. Then, we smash into a pile of rocks.Or have any water!
Lloyd::: Can't we use the ATV's converter?
Zane::: It was also damaged.
Nya::: What about the Rock Cycle's converter?
Zane::: It isn't adequate for a vehicle the size of the Dune Bounty.
Jay::: That is the only thing we can say. Useless pile ofunh! Aw, this stinks!No, no, no!Ahhh!
Cole::: Jay!
Jay::: Help! Ahh! 
Lloyd::: Hang on, Jay!
Jay::: Pull me in, pull me in!
Lloyd::: I can't. He's too strong.
Kai::: Cole, can you grab my shirt?
Cole::: I think so. 
Kai::: Take this! 
Jay:::Did you see that? He just tried to eat me!
Lloyd:::We better keep off the sand.
Jay:::Oh, really?! 
Zane::: I see only one option: The digestive system of a beetle is very slow. There is a good chance the Thermolytic Inverter is still intact inside Beohernie's stomach.
Jay::: Bernie.
Nya::: What good does that do?
Zane::: If one of us were to be ingested, we might be able to retrieve the device.
Cole::: Ingested?
Kai::: Uhh, are you kidding?
Zane::: If we can get inside Beohernie's stomach—
Jay::: Bernie.
Zane::: We should in theory be able to retrieve the Inverter and exit again.Either through the creature's mouth or through the other end of the digestive—
Jay:::Lalalalalala, I don't wanna hear this!
Cole::: Yeah. Of all the bad ideas I've ever heard, and I've heard a few. Lookin' at you, Kai, this takes the cake!
Nya::: I agree. It sounds nuts.
Zane::: The facts are indisputable. We need the Inverter. The Inverter is inside the beetle. Ergo, one of us must enter the beetle and retrieve it.
Lloyd::: Hmm.
Jay::: Don't tell me you're considering this!
Lloyd::: I'm open to other suggestions if anyone has one.
Nya::: How do we decide? Who gets to... you know, be—
Zane::: It was my idea. The responsibility is mine.
Lloyd::: No. I'm the responsible one.
Kai::: Guys, guys, you're both too valuable to risk. It should be someone expendable, like Jay.
Jay:::WHAT?!
Cole::: Well, look who's talking! 
Jay::: No, guys.
Cole::: I am naturally—
Lloyd::: Guys, guys! We're going to settle this like adults.
Jay:::Haha!
Zane::: I believe paper beats rock. Do not worry, my friends. Logically, I am the best choice. Being a Nindroid, I am more difficult to digest and can survive longer inside a stomach.
Jay:::So long, buddy.
Zane:::I have every intention of surviving, Jay.
Jay::: Sure you do, pal.Sure, you do.
Lloyd::: Let's run through the plan again.
Zane::: I bang the pot, drawing the creature's attention. He eats me. When I am in his stomach, I locate the Inverter, radio back, and you pull me out.
Lloyd::: Right. 
Jay::: What could possibly go wrong?
Lloyd::: Zane!
Jay::: Oh no!
Kai::: It ate him! It actually ate him! 
Nya::: Zane! Zane, can you hear me?
Cole::: Hang on, Zane!
Nya::: Zane, come in!
Lloyd::: Maybe the sand is blocking the signal.
Jay::: Or he's being dissolved in stomach acid!
Cole::: What do we do? 
Serpentine::: Revenge! 
Zane:::Oh my!Perhaps, this wasn't a good idea.
Jay:::This is crazy! How long has he been in there?
Nya::: Almost an hour.
Cole::: We gotta pull him out! Before it's too late.
Lloyd::: What if he needs more time to find the Inverter?
Kai::: Lloyd's right. We gotta stick to the plan and wait for the signal. 
Zane::: Hello? Can anyone hear me? Are you there?!
Lloyd::: Zane! 
Jay::: You're alive!
Cole:::Yeah, you're alive!
Kai:::Good job, Zane!
Nya::: Quiet, everyone! Quiet. Zane, we hear you. What's your situation?
Zane::: I have retrieved the Inverter.
Nya::: That's great! Hang tight. We'll get you out of there, Zane.
Lloyd::: Okay, guys. Let's reel him in.Give it some gas! Nice and easy!It's working!Keep going! Reel him in!
Cole::: I'm trying, but Bernie's not making it easy. Come on. Come on!
Jay::: Just like reeling in a thousand-pound tuna!
Lloyd::: There he is! Look!
Zane::: Come on.Open up!
Cole:::We're going to burn out the engine! We're going to lose him! Whoa! 
Lloyd::: Cole! 
Cole::: He's too strong!
Nya::: Hold on! 
Kai, Nya, Jay, and Lloyd:::Unh! 
Cole::: Aw, he's gonna pull us in!Whoa!
Nya::: Cole!
Jay::: Lookout! Here come the other two! 
Lloyd:::Got him!
Jay:::Ninja, gooo!Wha-ahh! Ahh!Oh, thank you, Nya! I love you.
Kai:::Unh! Come on, Zane! 
Lloyd:::Zane! Are you okay?
Nya::: Say something. 
Ninja:::Aw, Zane!
Jay:::Buddy! So worried.
Kai:::Nice!
Nya::: Everyone ready?
Lloyd::: Get us out of here.Here they come.
Nya::: Hold on, everyone. Here goes. 
Lloyd:::We made it!
Jay:::Yeah!
Kai::: Good job. Home free.
Jay::: That was one doozy of a mirage!
