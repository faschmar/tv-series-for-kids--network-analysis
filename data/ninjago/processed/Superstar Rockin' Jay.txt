Cole::: Whoa. This place is amazing.Where should we start? Maybe find a way to customize our avatars? We can upgrade our look!
Nya::: Cole, I know this Prime Empire place is like video game paradise for you, but our mission is to find Jay, not to get designer clothes.
Lloyd::: Uh, guys, that mission just got a bit more complicated! 
Cole::: Maybe this isn't as bad as it looks. Some games have tutorial assistants who meet new players and teach them how the game works.
Red Visor:::Eliminate the enemies of Unagami!
Kai:::It's as bad as it looks. 
Lloyd::: Time to go Spinjitzu on these digital creeps. Ninja, go! 
Kai::: Whoa, whoa! 
Nya::: Uh... Does anyone know what just happened?Or didn't happen?
Kai:::Ugh. Come on, Spinjitzu! Come on! 
Lloyd::: New plan. Elemental powers! Go! 
Nya::: Seriously? 
Kai::: Whoa!
Lloyd::: Ahh!
Nya::: What's going on?
Kai::: Not again! Awh! Can't I go, like, two seconds without losing my elemental powers?!
Lloyd::: Fight now and figure it out later. 
Kai:::Hunh-unh.Ahh.
Cole:::Wha-ahh!
Lloyd:::I don't get it. I feel weak and slow!Huh?Unh.
Nya:::Ha-unh! It's like our hard-earned ninja skills have been deleted or—Whoa!Jay?
Cole::: Hey, Nya, finding Jay isn't gonna be as hard as we thought. Look! 
Nya::: How did he get over there?
Kai::: Guys! Jay's here! 
Cole:::Whoa. Does he have teleportation powers in this game or—
Lloyd::: Gah! 
Jaybird 64::: Ha! Unh! 
Beta Jay 137::: Friends of Jay... welcome! 
Lloyd:::Which of you is the real Jay?
Beta Jay 137::: The "real" Jay is in the hearts of all who live by his word.
Jaybird 64:::Jay's will be done.
Jaywalkin 238:::In Jay we trust.
Dee-Jay 81:::In Jay we trust.
Beta Jay 137::: We are from "The League of Jay."
Cole::: Oh! You're all players, and you've chosen to play as avatars of Jay.
Kai::: Uh, we're talking about Jay? Right? Like, our Jay? 
Beta Jay 137::: Hurry! Come with us if you want to keep playing. 
Lloyd::: I guess we don't have a choice.Ha-unh!Ah. Uh, how did—What did just—huh?
Cole::: Hmm...Maybe you have to double-jump. Like in other video games, to reach really tall places. Watch. Jump! Double-jump! 
Kai::: That makes no sense! 
Nya:::Go with it!Wow! I just jumped on air.
Beta Jay 137::: Hurry! The great Jay wills it so! 
Lloyd::: I don't get it.I run all the time, but I'm already... getting... tired.
Beta Jay 137::: Of course, you're getting tired. You're a noob. Your stamina stats are probably quite low.
Cole::: Wait. Are you saying the reason we don't have our powers is because—
Beta Jay 137::: You haven't bought any skills yet. Here. See my skill tree. See? I have Level 48 stamina.And I have enough experience points to buy another skill. Here."Super-back-flip-flying-kick." 
Nya::: Seriously? It took me months to learn that move in the real world. But in here you just "buy another skill?" Not fair! 
Beta Jay 137::: There may come a day when the courage of Jays fails... but this is not that day!
Jays::: Jay-Ja... go! 
Kai::: Wha-ahh! 
Lloyd::: Kai! 
Kai:::I-I'm alive?How am I alive?I just-I—Oh, duh!Video game! I just re-spawned. Ha! None of this is real!
Lloyd::: It feels real! 
Beta Jay 137:::We will draw them away. Follow the streets to the northwest for 13 blocks. There you will find one of our allies waiting.Give him the password, "Mister Cuddlywomp" and he will bring you to Superstar Rockin' Jay. Now fly!
Nya::: I understand... kind of.
Beta Jay 137::: Hmm, I can see why you are beloved to him. 
Nya::: The Jays said we need to go to—Hide!Kai! Hide!
Kai::: Why? This is a game. If they blast us, we just come back. Here, I'll distract, you get around behind them.Hey, guys! You know who's totally lame?Unagami, that's who!
Red Visor::: The enemies of Unagami must pay! 
Kai::: Whoo—See? "Re-spawn" is my new favorite word. Whoo-hoo!
Cole::: Uh, I don't know if that's really smart. In games-
Kai:::Whatever, Cole. You're just annoyed that as the team's gaming guru, you weren't the one who figured this out!Huh!
Lloyd::: Come on, guys.
Nya::: This is where they told us to meet. Only... there's no garage.
Lloyd::: Why send us to an empty lot?
Kai::: I told you. They're wackos! Anyone who likes Jay that much can't be normal.
Man::: Freeze.Talk. Before Mister Ginormous here does the talking.
Cole::: Um, shoot, what was it? Mister Snugglewomp? Fuddlewimp? No, no Fud-Fud—Argh! Buddygump?
Nya::: "Mister Cuddlywomp."
Man:::The League sent you, huh? Let me guess. You're here to see Superstar Rockin' Jay?Come on. Before someone sees us. 
Nya::: A cloaked hideout? 
Cole, Kai, and Lloyd::: Wow.
Nya::: Awesome!
Man::: Name's Scott. I'm a mechanic. My garage is hidden by a Level 999 Stealth Barrier. Those Red Visors can't see it.Even Unagami can't.
Nya::: What are you hiding from?
Scott::: The Red Visors want me to compete in the Speedway Five-Billion. Like everyone else. But I'm smarter. No thanks. And the League of Jays keep my secret, so I help them rebuild their vehicles and weapons and stuff.
Kai::: Hm. What's this?
Scott::: Don't touch that, it's—Dangerous...
Kai:::Huh. I love this infinite-lives-thing!
Scott:::Infinite? Who told you that?You get four lives in Prime Empire. And looks like you've used three.
Kai:::What? What? Why didn't anyone tell me this?
Cole::: I tried, but you wouldn't listen.
Kai::: Oh, sure, blame the victim!So, so wait, what happens if I lose this last one?
Scott::: You don't want to know. It's horrible. Why do you think I won't race in the Speedway?I only have one life left myself.Anyway. If you seek Superstar Rockin' Jay, this is the way. 
Cole::: We're supposed to trust a complete stranger and go into a dangerous looking dark hole? 
Kai::: I... I can't believe this. Are we in a nightmare?
Beta Jay 137::: Attention League of Jay.Attention League of Jay! It is time for the arrival of our hero, our inspiration, the reason for our very existence... Superstar Rockin' Jay himself! 
Jay::: Aww.Hmm.Guys? Is that really you?Wow, I've been waiting for you. Is this place awesome, or what?!
