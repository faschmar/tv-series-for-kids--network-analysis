Nya::: Try again.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Still nothing.
Maya::: Maybe the line is blocked.
Nya::: It's not the line, we just replaced the line.
Maya::: Oh, what about that little clicky-thumpy thing over there?
Nya::: You mean the piston?
Maya::: Ah! Is that what it's called?
Nya::: It's not the piston, Mom. It's the battery, okay? It's dead. Look. Isn't there something else you could be doing?
Maya::: I'm here to help you, dear!
Nya::: I don't need help! I've been doing just fine for a long time. The whole time you were gone, and Kai and I were on our own, raising ourselves? Remember that time?
Maya::: You know that your father and I didn't have any choice about that. We were imprisoned, and ...
Nya::: Oh, I know, Mom, I know! I'm not saying it's your fault, I'm just saying -It's a bit late to help now. I'm not a little girl anymore, okay?
Nya::: Great. You guys heard all that?
Jay::: Uh, heard what?
Lloyd::: No, we, um ... 
Zane::: Yes, we did.
Jay::: Zane, I think we need to adjust your honesty circuits. 
Nya::: Well, bad news. I can't fix it. The battery is shot.
P.I.X.A.L.::: We must find a way to recharge it.
Jay::: Uh, what about me? Why don't I just give it the ole' zap zap?
P.I.X.A.L.::: The sub is powered by a high capacity carbon-ion battery. Linking you with it would be very dangerous.
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L. is right. I was briefly attached to a similar contraption, and it nearly proved fatal.
Jay::: Good reason. Moving on. Um, is there any other way to charge it?
P.I.X.A.L.::: We need a large supply of energy.
Maya::: What about the power source we've been tracking? How far away is that?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Approximately 300 yards southeast of our position.
Jay::: That's pretty close.
Zane::: And Maya is correct in theory. If we can locate the energy source, we should be able to tap into it with a portable battery, bring the unit back, and recharge the sub.
Lloyd::: 300 yards. How do we get there?
P.I.X.A.L.::: What about the APS suits?
Nya::: What's an APS suit?
Maya::: Oh, my.
Nya::: Wow!I'll take this one.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I intended to build one for each of us, but ran out of time. I didn't even have time to fully test these suits, but I am reasonably sure that they will function as intended.
Nya::: How sure?
P.I.X.A.L.::: 55 percent.
Nya::: That's good enough for me.
Jay::: Nya, maybe I should go.
Nya::: I'm the master of Water, Jay, and there's nothing but water out there. Even with my powers acting weird, I'm still the best choice for this mission.
Maya::: I'll take the other.
Nya::: Mom, I really don't need any -
Maya::: Yes, you do. I was the master of Water before you, Nya, and I still know a thing or two. If something goes wrong out there, I can help.
Lloyd::: She's right, Nya. My powers won't be much help out there. Neither will Zane's or Jay's.
P.I.X.A.L.::: You'll need this. And I've keyed the suit's tracker to the energy signal. It should guide you straight there. 
Jay::: Be careful out there.
Nya::: We're all set.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Roger. Flooding chamber now.
Nya::: Switching on thrust jets.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Affirmative. We have visual.
Nya:::Hydrothermal vents. Let's stick close.Huh? Thanks, Mom. That was a close one.
Maya::: Nya, I know you're angry with me, I wasn't there for you and Kai, but I had to make a choice.
Nya::: I know, Mom.
Maya::: No, you don't. You've never had to make a big sacrifice like that, and I hope you never do. Sometimes there are no good choices, Nya, and that's just how the cookie crumbles.
Nya::: I don't like crumbly cookies. I like chewy cookies.
Maya::: One day, you'll understand.
Nya:::I'm picking up something.
Lloyd::: The energy source is 500 yards away. Can you see anything?
Nya::: Nothing yet. 
Maya::: Wow.
Lloyd::: Nya, what is it?
Nya::: It appears to be an underwater temple of some kind.
Maya::: Off we go, into a spooky old temple.Oh, my.
Nya::: Zane? P.I.X.A.L.? You guys seeing this?
Zane::: I could be mistaken, but I believe it is a very primitive dialect that predates the First Spinjitzu Master.
Nya::: What does it say?
Zane::: It appears to be a warning not to enter. "Go no further, ye who seek." Something... "for the sleeper in the deep must not be disturbed until the end of days."
Lloyd::: The what?
Zane::: I am unable to translate the seventh word. I am running it through all known databases.
Jay::: Um, why would anyone be sleeping in a creepy underwater temple? That makes no sense.
Nya:::Well, the signal is coming from the other side of these doors, so whatever it says, I don't think we have a choice.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Be careful, Nya.
Merlopian scientist::: Hmm. Burnt out, just like the others.
Kalmaar:::I grow tired of your excuses, Glutinous.
Maya::: Who's that?
Glutinous::: Without the second talisman, I fear it will not work! All of our previous efforts to awaken the serpent have failed!
Kalmaar::: Your efforts are inadequate!
Glutinous::: I need more time! Time to study the first talisman, time to manufacture a stronger replica!
Kalmaar::: You've had too much time already, my patience is at an end! Try again!
Glutinous::: We don't even know what the talisman is made of! If it's technological nature, a magical ar- 
Kalmaar::: Awaken the serpent now! Or I will have you replaced with someone who can!
Glutinous::: Yes, sir, yes, yes, sir! Right away! Prepare another trial! Attach the cables! Insert fabrication twelve! Powering on.
Nya::: I've seen that before.
Zane::: Oh, no.
Lloyd::: Zane.
Zane::: I know the identity of the sleeper.
Lloyd::: Who is it?
Zane::: Wojira!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Oh, no.
Lloyd::: No way.
Jay::: It can't be. I thought it was just a myth!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Nya! Zane has deciphered the identity of the sleeper. It's Wojira!
Zane::: Nya, Maya! Get out of there!
Maya::: Nya, look out!Nya!
Kalmaar::: Surface dwellers, in my temple?! 
Nya::: Mom, run!
Kalmaar::: Don't just stand there! Stop them!No! 
Nya::: Mom! 
Kalmaar::: Impossible. 
Nya::: Mom, are you okay? 
Kalmaar::: Can it be? Can it actually be?After all this time, fate has finally brought us together. You, the usurper, the Elemental Master of Water. And me, the rightful heir and ruler of the Endless Sea.
