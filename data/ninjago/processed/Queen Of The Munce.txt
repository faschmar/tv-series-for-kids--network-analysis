Lloyd::: I wonder what happened to the others.
Nya::: Yeah, I hope they're safe.
Lloyd::: I guess, for now, we'll have to follow these guys wherever they're going.
Jay::: The others will be okay. Don't worry.
Lloyd::: I hope so.
Murt::: Um... hmm.
Lloyd::: Everything okay? Why'd we stop?
Murt::: Murt not remember the way.
Jay::: What? I thought you knew these tunnels like the back of your hand!
Murt:::Uh...
Jay:::Ugh.
Murt::: Is one of these. Either this way, or this way, or this way.
Lloyd::: Yeah, um, we figured it was one of them, Murt, but we kinda need to know which one.
Murt::: How about this way? 
Lloyd::: That's the way we just came.
Jay::: Oh, great! Now we're gonna get lost down here, we're never gonna see the sun again, we're all gonna -
Nya::: It's this way, guys!
Jay::: How do you know?
Nya::: I can see footprints in the dirt.
Jay::: Oh. Nice work, Nya. See, I told you it would be fine!
Nya, Jay, and Lloyd:::Wow.
Munce Sentry::: Halt! Who goes there?
Murt::: Where?
Munce Sentry::: There!
Lloyd::: He means you, Murt.
Murt::: Oh. Murt goes there.
Munce Sentry 1::: Murt? Son of Murt?
Munce Sentry 2::: You escape from the Skull Sorcerer? How? 
Munce Sentry::: My Queen! We have visitors.
Murtessa:::Murt!
Murt:::My Queen. Murt escape. With help of these "moutsiders."
Murtessa::: How? No one has ever returned from the caverns held by the Skull Sorcerer.
Murt::: If you wish to hear story, Murt will tell.
Jay:::This should be interesting.
Nya::: Shh!
Murtessa::: Tell!
Murt:::We were like so many days. Always thunk, thunk, thunk.And then, they came. And the Skull Sorcerer was like so . And the ninja went like thisand this . And then, caught like so, thunk, thunk, thunk ! But then, this! And then, they fought,and like so, poof ! And like this. And the Skull Sorcerer was like this.Arrrgh.Boo-hoo-hoo. 
Nya::: Murt, you okay?
Murt::: And so it was. We are free, thanks to them.
Murtessa::: Hmm.This is true? You are ninja from the surface? And you freed my subjects?
Lloyd::: Uh...
Jay::: Yes, it is, your Majesty.
Murtessa::: I am most grateful. How can I repay this?
Jay::: Oh, no, it was nothing. Forget it.
Murtessa::: You are also modest, I see.
Jay::: Well, heh, modesty prevents me from agreeing, but... yes.
Murtessa::: And who is this? Your servant?
Nya::: Servant?
Jay::: Oh, oh, no no no. This is Nya, my "yang."
Murtessa::: Yang?
Nya:::It means we belong together!
Murtessa::: Hmm. Make our guests comfortable. Give them whatever they wish. Our best quarters, food, drink. Even for the Yang-Servant.
Jay:::Aah!
Nya::: Yang-Servant? Can you believe that?
Lloyd::: Actually, I think it went pretty well.
Nya::: And you didn't say anything!
Jay::: What? No, I totally did!
Lloyd::: Will you guys relax? This is good. They might be willing to help us. And we can use all the help we can get right now. Finding the others, dealing with that Skull Sorcerer guy, and - hey, look. 
Jay::: Huh.
Lloyd::: That must be this "Milly" guy.
Munce Sentry::: Ahem. Queen Murtessa asks if you would dine with her.
Lloyd::: Of course. We would be honored.
Munce Sentry::: No. Not you. Just him. 
Nya::: That's it! You tell the Queen we're a team! Where he goes, we all go. Right, Jay?Right?!
Jay::: Ow! Yes! Haha, right!
Murtessa:::Bring another two bowls.
Jay::: What is this?
Nya:::Ugh. I have no idea.
Jay::: Oh! Think it's trying to eat me.
Murtessa::: Is it true you know Spinjitzu?
Jay::: Uh, yes.
Murtessa::: And you have Elemental Powers?
Jay::: I-I do.
Nya::: We all do, actually-
Murtessa::: I hope you will show me, Ninja-Jay. I would love to see a demonstration.
Jay::: Oh, uh, okay. Um, how about this?Oh, gee, um. Hehe, that doesn't usually happen, heh.
Murtessa::: It is beautiful! I have never seen such beauty. Truly, you are gifted. Brave, modest, and powerful! Tell me. Are you ... betrothed?
Nya::: Yes! He is! To me! 
Lloyd::: So, um, what is this wonderful food? Heh.Oh, thank goodness.
Murtessa::: I demand the Munce rite of ritual combat to fight for the honor of Ninja-Jay, for you are unworthy!
Nya::: Are you nuts? I'm not gonna fight for Jay!
Murtessa::: Why not? You're afraid? You hide behind others, like a child?
Lloyd::: Nya, come on, don't. It's - it's not worth it.
Murtessa::: Like frightened child? Child!
Nya::: That's it! Bring it! 
Lloyd::: Nya, you can't do this.
Jay::: Yeah, Nya, there's gotta be a better way.
Nya::: Well if you figure it out, let me know. Jay, has it occurred to you what would happen if I didn't fight? You'd have to stay here, forever! She wants you to be her king, or whatever the Munce call it.
Jay::: King? M-me? I would have to stay down here? Forever? Eating that disgusting Munce food?
Nya::: Yes, Jay.
Jay::: You have to win this, Nya! This is serious!
Nya::: Oh, I intend to. 
Murtessa::: Ninja-Jay! I challenge this "moutsider" creature to combat, for you! I wish you to be my king, for even though you have tiny arms and ugly human face, you have a stout heart and are a mighty warrior! We should be together.
Nya::: Not if I can help it.
Murtessa::: Let the combat begin!
Nya::: You asked for it, lady.
Murtessa::: For what?
Nya::: For this! Hiya!Huh? What the-Hey! Aah!
Jay::: Nya!
Nya::: Quit that! That's not how you - 
Jay::: Lloyd, I'm scared.
Lloyd::: Relax. Nya's got this. I hope.
Nya::: Okay, lady. Let's see how you like it when I spin! Ninja go!
Lloyd::: See?
Munce::: The Queen. She-she-
Munce::: She has lost.
Munce::: The Queen has lost! Long live the Queen!
Munce::: Queen Mya.
Munce::: Queen Mya!
Munce audience::: Queen Mya! Queen Mya! Queen Mya! Queen Mya! Queen Mya! 
Lloyd::: Oh, boy.
Jay::: I did not see that coming.
