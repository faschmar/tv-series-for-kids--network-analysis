Antonia::: Pretty much. Another time, there was a giant stone monster and a bunch of crazy bikers.
Nelson:::Aw, man. My lunch got hit by a fireball. 
Antonia:::Go on.
Nelson:::Thanks.
Antonia::: We paperboys gotta stick together. The city's crazy, but everyone's doing their part. We may not be ninja, but our job's important, too. People gotta know what's going on.

Nelson:::Huh... 
Antonia::: He'll be fine. Don't worry.
Nelson::: Hey, what about what he said? About the ninja?
Antonia:::We're paperboys, kid. That's a little out of our league.
Nelson::: Which way is the monastery?
Antonia::: Forget it. It's not our problem.
Nelson::: You said we have a responsibility. It's our job to let people know what's happening.The news never sleeps, remember?
Antonia:::The monastery is that way. And the only way to there from here is Route 23. Which you don't want. Trust me. 
Nelson::: "Everyone has to do their part." Those were your words.
Antonia:::Okay, kid. But stick close.This could get hairy.This way!This is it. Route 23. Still sure you wanna try it? 
Nelson::: Oh, no.
Antonia::: Come on. It's now or never. 
Nelson::: W-Wait! I'm not sure this was a good idea.
Antonia::: Too late! Just do what I do, and you'll make it. Come on!Unh! Your turn. Come on!
Nelson::: No, no, no, Wait. No way. No, no, no, no, no. I can't do that.
Antonia::: You gotta! You don’t have a choice! Come on!
Nelson:::Ninja never quit.Nothing broken? I'm alive. I'm alive!
Antonia::: Told ya you could do it. 
Nelson::: I-I can't believe we're here. We're actually here.
Antonia:::Hope you know what you're gonna say, kid.
Nelson::: Me? Why me?
Antonia::: This was your idea.
Wu::: May I help you?
Nelson::: You're-you're-you're—
Antonia::: Go on. Tell him.

Wu::: What? Where? How?
Nelson::: He said they were trapped in a pyramid.In the desert.
Wu::: And you came all this way to tell me?
Nelson::: Just doing our part, sir. Like everyone else.
Wu:::Thank you, my son. You remind me of another young boy who was once a student of mine. His name was Lloyd.I must tell P.I.X.A.L.Thank you, both of you.Straight home now. Go! And please, be careful.
Nelson::: He just compared me to the Green Ninja. Did you hear that?
