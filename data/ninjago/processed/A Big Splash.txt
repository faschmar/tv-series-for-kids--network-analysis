Henchman #1::: All clear, boss! 
Henchman #1::: Uh, they are paying triple, Mrs. Demeanor.
Miss Demeanor::: It's not Mrs. Demeanor, it's Miss Demeanor!How many times do I have to say it?
Henchman #1::: Sorry, Miss Demeanor.
Miss Demeanor::: Why'd they want to meet out here anyway? We're in the middle of nowhere!
Henchman #2::: Probably so those nosy ninja don't find us.
Lloyd::: Too late for that! 
Henchman #1::: The ninja!
Miss Demeanor::: Ooh, I've been waiting for this! I've worked so hard to make it to the top. And it's actually happening! Oh, wait, wait, wait, I had a line for this. Oh yeah, I've got a warm welcome planned!Get the trucks out of here. You four, get the ninja!
Jay::: I don't get it. Why do we fight common thugs so often?
Miss Demeanor::: So long, boys! I hope our paths cross again! 
Cole::: How's this? Too soon? 
Miss Demeanor:::Nice try, ninja! You almost had me!
Cole:::Vengestone?
Lloyd::: Nya, Zane, they're headed your way. Cut them off. We'll catch up.
Nya::: We're on it.
Miss Demeanor:::Faster, go faster! They're trying to cut us off!
Henchman::: Yes, Miss Demeanor.
Lloyd::: Nya, need a little water power.
Nya::: I'm on it.
Lloyd::: Zane, get ready. As soon as Nya douses the truck, flash freeze everything!
Zane::: Affirmative.
Nya::: Here goes! 
Lloyd::: Now! Hit the truck!Nya, drop it on the truck!
Nya::: I'm trying. It's not obeying!
Miss Demeanor::: Ha! She's lost control! That's embarrassing.
Zane::: Nya! 
Miss Demeanor::: Get your act together! I'm doing my part. Am I the only professional?
Jay::: They're getting away!
Lloyd::: I know, but I think we have bigger problems.
Zane:::I - I can't hold it! 
Lloyd::: Look out!Nya, just drop the water back down!
Nya::: I'm trying! Nothing's working!
Cole::: What do we do? There's a village full of farmers over there!
Lloyd::: Evacuate the village. If this much water comes down on top of them, someone might get hurt.Nice and calm, everyone. There's no reason for concern. Just keep moving.
Jay::: Right this way!
Zane::: Come along, child.
Child::: I want to stay and see the water.
Zane::: I'm afraid that would be very dangerous.
Child::: It's okay, I'm a Nindroid like you.Beep, boop, bop!
Zane::: I do not speak like that.
Lloyd::: Run! 
Child::: Beep, boop, bop.
Zane::: Beep, boop, bop.
Wu::: What was in the trucks?
Cole::: Vengestone.
Lloyd::: A huge shipment, three trucks worth.
Wu::: Hmm. Very peculiar. Vengestone has few practical uses. Why would anyone be smuggling Vengestone?
Lloyd::: We don't know. The criminal called herself Miss Demeanor, but she got away before we could ask her.
Wu::: You let her escape?
Kai::: We didn't exactly ... let her.
Zane::: We were forced to contend with ... unexpected complications.
Wu::: What complications?
Nya::: It was me, okay? It was me. Just saying. I messed everything up. I had a teensy tiny little momentary loss of control, and I kind of created a small tidal wave.
Wu::: How?
Nya::: I don't know how! Okay? Can we change the subject?
Lloyd::: Nya, it was a hundred foot tall tornado of water.
Nya::: We've all made mistakes! It's no big deal. It won't happen again, okay?
Cole::: Okay.
Lloyd::: Yeah, okay.
Jay::: Right!
Zane::: Affirmative.
Nya::: Good! 
Jay::: Oh no, the sprinklers! 
Wu::: Just as I thought. This is a complete list of the elemental powers, but there is no mention of Water, or Wind.
Cole::: What does that mean?
Wu::: My father, the First Spinjitzu Master, used to tell me an old fairy tale about how he mastered all of the elemental powers, but never Wind or Water.
Lloyd::: Why not?
Wu::: He said those were not his to command. They belonged to someone else. To Wojira.
Zane::: Wojira. That name is familiar to us. If my database is correct, it was a storm spirit of some kind.
Wu::: Wojira commanded the elements of Water and Wind. When combined, they became a force of destruction, the Fury of the Storm.
Lloyd::: That's Wojira?
Wu::: I believe so.
Cole::: What does it say?
Wu::: Very little, I'm afraid. It says here that the First Spinjitzu Master conquered her with the help of the Merlopians.
Zane::: I have no mention of the word "Merlopian" in any of my databases.
Wu::: They were a sea folk. They lived here before my father came, but there is little else known about them.In the midst of the battle, a Merlopian warrior with a trident and a helmet rose from the depths of the great ocean, and pried from the great serpent's head two amulets: an amulet of amulet of Wave. And the seas grew calm, and the great serpent fell into a deep slumber.
Lloyd::: An amulet of Storm. Like the one on the Island of the Keepers?
Jay::: So Nya's powers are linked to Wojira? Or these amulets?
Wu::: It's possible. I don't know. We need to find someone who does.
Zane::: Who?
Wu:::What about your mother? She was the elemental master of water before Nya. She might be able to help Nya regain control of her powers.
Kai:::Nya and Mom aren't that close. They hardly know each other. Our parents were gone most of our childhood.
Zane::: They were imprisoned by Krux.
Cole::: Yeah, you can't exactly blame them.
Kai::: I don't. But it doesn't change the fact that we grew up on our own. Nya is pretty independent, in case you haven't noticed.
Lloyd::: Uh ...
Jay::: Yeah!
Zane::: This is a fact.
Wu::: I'm sure that she will understand. Nya is reasonable.
Kai::: Hey, sis.
Nya::: What's up, Kai?
Kai::: Oh, nothing. Say now, I was just talking to Master Wu, about your little problem, and he had an interesting idea.
Nya::: What interesting idea?
Kai:::Uh, he thought maybe you should consider calling ... Mom.
Nya::: Mom? Why?
Kai::: She was the elemental master of water before you. You know, she can help, offer advice, or something?
Nya::: I don't need help. I can figure it out! I just need to relax a bit. Find my focus again. Regroup!
Kai::: I'm just saying, she might know something. She might be able to fix your little problem.
Nya::: I don't have a problem. I made one mistake, okay? A teensy tiny mistake and it won't happen again! 
Kai::: I'm gonna go ... do something else. 
Nya:::Who's losing control now? Not me! 
Jay:::Oh no! The toilet's exploding! Someone help!Why?!
Nya::: Oh! 
Wu::: Nya, we need to talk. 
Nya:::I'll get it. 
Maya::: Nya dear, oh, you poor thing! Look at you! Kai told me all about what's happening and I don't want you to worry anymore. Whatever it is, we're gonna figure it out, you and me, mother and daughter, working together. I'll be with you every single moment of every day, until we figure this out.Bring the bags, Ray! Oh, Kai, which way is Nya's room?
Kai::: Oh, uh, that way. 
Ray::: Hi, son. Good to see you. 
Kai:::Hi... Dad. Do you, need a hand?
Ray::: Oh, no, I've got it! I'm... good. 
Nya::: Kai! 
Kai::: What?
