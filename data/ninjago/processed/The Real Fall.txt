Hazza D'ur::: Nothing comes without sacrifice.
Skull Sorcerer::: My subjects will want to know what happened to their princess.Luckily, I have the perfect scapegoat. Or should I say, dragon. Guards! There's been a terrible accident. The Princess fell into the Pit.
Hailmar::: How?
Vangelis::: It was that - that creature! It turned on her and attacked her. I want it locked up!
Hailmar::: The Princess' dragon? Chompy?
Vangelis::: You heard me. I want the beast locked up! Now!
Cole::: Master Wu! Are you okay?
Wu::: What?
Cole::: I said, are you okay?
Wu::: For the moment, yes!
Cole::: Speed up! I can't hear you!
Wu::: I'm falling as fast as I can! You have to slow down!
Cole::: How?
Wu::: Use your Elemental Powers!
Cole::: What?
Wu::: Your Elemental Powers! Use your powers to slow down! 
Cole::: You really think that would work?
Wu::: Yes!
Cole::: Okay, here goes nothing.It's not working!
Vania::: Master Wu! Cole!
Wu::: Princess Vania?
Vania::: I'm coming! But you have to slow down!
Wu::: How?
Vania::: Use your arms, like this! 
Wu:::Oh, what am I doing? It's no use. That won't work!
Cole::: I've got an idea.I need a bigger vine. 
Wu::: Cole! Stop playing with those twigs and stay with me! 
Cole::: Gotcha.
Vania::: Hang on. I'm almost there!
Cole::: Are you sure those wings will hold all three of us?
Vania::: No, but it's our only chance! Now reach!Gotcha!Oh no!
Cole::: Oh, I was afraid of that!
Vania::: What do we do?
Wu::: Firstly, allow me to say you are handling this situation remarkably well.
Vania::: Thank you, but I'm with you and Cole and I'm sure you've been in way worse situations.
Wu::: Uh...
Cole::: Uh, nope.
Vania::: But I'm sure you have a plan.
Cole::: Not me!
Wu::: Alas, no. 
Wu::: This is not an improvement.
Cole::: It's-it's not working. I'm just getting more and more stuck.
Vania::: We have to calm down and think. I read in a book by the highly acclaimed adventurer and explorer, Clutch Powers, that the key to staying calm is to do vocal exercises like - AAH! 
Cole::: Oh boy. 
Wu::: Hold on, Cole!
Cole::: Please get me out of here!
Vania::: Cole! Try to remain calm!
Cole::: It's very hard!
Cole::: What's happening? I can't see anything!
Wu::: That's probably for the best!
Vania::: There are two giant spiders fighting over you!
Cole::: What? Get them away from me!
Vania::: Uh, they have very large fangs and both look very hungry. Ooh, but the good news is, they just dropped you and are now fighting each other.Uh oh.
Cole::: "Uh oh"? What is "Uh oh" mean?
Vania::: There's a third spider, and it looks even more hungry than the others!
Cole::: Now what's going on?
Vania::: It's going to eat you!
Cole::: Aah! Do something!
Vania::: I am doing something!Take that!Oh no!Okay. Get away. Shoo. Shoo! Bad spider. Bad!
Cole::: Help me!
Vania:::Master Wu! What do we do?
Wu::: I'm thinking.
Vania::: This can't be good!
Cole::: I have an idea, but I don't think you're gonna like it.
Wu::: Just do it!
Cole::: Uh, if you say so! 
Wu::: We're falling again.
Cole::: Well, falling is better than being eaten by spiders.
Vania::: It's not the falling I'm worried about. It's the landing.
Wu:::Take my hand. Before we get separated! 
Cole::: Master Wu?
Wu::: Cole.
Cole::: Are you still falling?
Wu::: More like sliding.
Cole::: Okay, just checking. We are, too. 
Wu::: This is outrageous.
Cole::: There's nothing to hold onto.
Wu::: Grab onto those rocks. 
Vania::: Help!
Wu::: Now what?
Cole::: It's a whirlpool! It's like a giant toilet that's been flushed, except in this case, we're the -
Wu::: I know, Cole. Just swim.Cole! The stalactites. Break them off. Use your powers!
Cole::: How? I can't reach them!
Wu::: You can do it. You have to try!Cole, you can do it! You are surrounded by earth. Connect with your Element. Your powers should be stronger than ever.
Vania::: Concentrate, Cole!
Wu:::I-I think we're safe now.
Vania::: We just need to find a way out of here. And let's avoid going further down.
Cole::: How can we get any lower? 
Vania::: Uh oh. 
Sorcerer::: Ah, visitors from above.
Cole::: Aah!
Sorcerer::: The good King Vangelis has cast you out, has he? Well, fear not, weary travelers, for you are safe now. You are in Rock-Bottom, and there is no further to fall.
Thief:::Relax, pal, that's just Adam. He's harmless.
Barbarian::: You are safe here. You are among us. The Lowly.
Cole::: Huh? What?
Thief::: Might as well get used to it, because there ain't no way back up. This is your new home, pal.
