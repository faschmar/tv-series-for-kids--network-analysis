Wu::: Focus.In order to bear the fate of Ninjago on your shoulders, you must first learn to bear the weight of all of us.
Wu:::Focus.
Jay::: Sensei, I'm starting to think this was a bad idea.
Cole::: Yeah, Sensei, he's just a kid.
Wu::: In order for him to succeed, we must all trust one another.
Cole::: What was that?
Dareth:::Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! This wasn't supposed to happen until tomorrow!
Foreman::: Tomorrow?Let me see that order.Oh, yeah. My bad. Sorry about that. We'll be back in the morning. 
Cole::: Uh, Dareth, what is this all about?
Dareth::: Well, I fell behind on some of my payments and some developer named dojo is gone.
Jay::: But, we already lost the Bounty. We can't lose the dojo now.
Dareth::: My trophies. Oh, my fakes trophies! 
Zane::: Wait a minute. "Darnagom?" When you rearrange the letters, it spells—
Jay::: "O grandma"?
Kai::: No! Garmadon!
Jay::: Right.That would make more sense.
Lloyd::: Um, my dad is behind this?
Cole::: If he destroys the dojo, where will we train Lloyd?
Dareth:::Any chance you got 50,000 in that teapot of yours.
Wu::: Worry not, Dareth. You're not in this alone. We're all with you.
Nya:::Did someone say 50,000—
Jay:::You didn't happen to win the lottery?
Nya::: No, but I heard about Ninjaball Run!
All but Nya::: Ninjaball Run?
Nya::: It's the biggest road race in Ninjago, with a prize of 100,000 big ones. And it's tomorrow.
Dareth::: I thank you, little lady fighter, but you're talking about the most dangerous race known to man. Only the most serious of racers even stand a chance.
Kai::: But didn't you just do a few upgrades on our Ultra Sonic Raider? Maybe we might stand a chance.
Lloyd::: And I can enter with my Dragon. You did say I needed the practice.
Wu::: So it is agreed. You will all enter this "Ninjaball Run" to save the dojo.
Nya:::Are you still crying?
Dareth::: Yes. But these are happy tears.
Announcer #1::: Welcome, everyone, to the 14th annual Ninjaball Run!
Announcer #2::: The Grand Prix where it doesn't matter how you get there, as long as you get there first.
Announcer #1::: Well, let's take a look at the racers.
Announcer #2::: I see the starter's line. We have a few familiar faces.
Postman::: Watch it, you big oaf!
Cole:::You look nervous, Lloyd. You okay?
Lloyd::: N-n-nervous?Maybe for you guys.
Nya:::One final thing: I installed a pretty cool upgrade so if you're ever in a really tight spot, pull that lever because what it does. . .
Kai::: What?!
Nya::: Pull that lever, because if you pull that lever. . .
Announcer #1::: Alright, the race is about to start. And officials are saying pit crews must take their places.
Nya::: . . .only under those circumstances and no other.
Announcer #1::: We're about to begin!
Nya::: That's my cue. Gotta go! Good luck! 
Kai::: Huh? Wait, Nya, we couldn't hear you!
Cole::: Look, it's my dad. They entered too?
Royal Blacksmiths::: Too big, too big. Too slow, too slow. We had a lead but let it go.
Jay:::Oh, no.
Edna::: Jay! Jay! Oh. Oh, look, he sees us, Ed.
Ed::: I see him, Edna. You don't have to embarrass the boy.
Jay::: Oh, is there anyone we don't have to compete against?
Announcer #2::: Wait a minute, it appears some skeletons have crashed the party. Is this against the rules?
Announcer #1::: Rules?!There's only one rule in Ninjaball Run, and that is cross the finish line first. Let's take a look at the course. The first gruelling leg starts on the streets of Ninjago City and empties out into the treacherous Sea of Sand. Racers, look out for the dangerous crater way known as Crash Course Canyon, where the slightest mistake can be your last! The next two legs of the race take us into the winding maze known as the Birchwood Forest, and then through the perilous and icy Glacier Barrens. Finally, in the fourth and final leg, racers must beat the desert heat in the Badlands, which then takes us back to the finish line here in the heart of Ninjago City!
Kai::: I don't know, guys, if we're gonna save the dojo, we're gonna have to beat some pretty stiff competition.
Announcer #1::: One final word: let's have a good clean race!So good luck to everyone.
Announcer #1::: On your mark, get set,Ninjaball GO!
Lloyd::: Come on, boy!Whoa!
Zane::: What happened?
Cole::: We've been sabotaged!
Lloyd::: Whoa! Oh!Wrong way! Oh! Oh, we're going the wrong way.
Skales::: It's about time! Let's get outta here.
Skales::: What in the world is going on?
Announcer #1:::Ooh, things just got interesting. And it seems some new competitors have entered the race. Meanwhile, the ninja remain at the starter's line in dead last!
Jay::: Oh, great! We're already out of the race!
Cole::: We can't quit now, not with everything that's on the line. Help me lift this thing.
Kai::: So that's how this is gonna go. Alright, boys, let's do this!
Garmadon::: Now that the dojo will be destroyed, we'll crush them before Lloyd ever becomes a true ninja.
Announcer #1:::We're here live at the 14th annual Ninjaball Run, where it looks like the ninja are back in the race and now have a long shot at winning this year's massive cash prize!
Garmadon::: They're trying to save the dojo? Will they ever quit?!Set sail for the race at once! We can't let them win!
Brad::: Huh?
Soto::: Treachery, me lads! Let 'em have it!
Brad::: Uh oh.
Announcer #1::: Ouchy mama! Pirates are out of the race!
Soto:::Why do I let you drive?! Ahh! 
Royal Blacksmiths & Their Driver::: So long, A-do. You're wrecked and looking blue. Doo-doo, doo-doo. So here's a song. . .
Soto::: Ahh! 
Royal Blacksmiths & Their Driver::: And here is a tune. . . 
Soto::: Blast ye scurvy knaves! I'll get you for this!
No-Eyed Pete's Parrot:::Left!No, your other left! 
Jay::: Yeah!We're no longer in last! Things are looking up.
Kai::: Oh, no, Garmadon!
Jay::: What?!
Spitta::: Lord Garmadon, are you going to use the Mega Weapon?
Garmadon::: What's the point? Look at them: they're trapped like rats. Set all cannons to fire. Now that they're in our sights, they have nowhere to run.
Jay::: Ah, we're sitting ducks! There's nowhere to run!
Announcer #1::: And are those cannons?I would not wanna be in the Ultra Sonic Raider right now.
Announcer #2:::Oh, I can't watch. But you, the fans can, in glorious high definition.
Nya:::They can't get out of the way!
Dareth::: I can't bear to look. 
Garmadon::: Goodbye, ninja. 
Lloyd::: Oh! Ahh! Out of the way! 
Kai::: Nice going, Lloyd.
Cole::: You saved us!
Lloyd::: I did? I mean, yeah, I did! Hey, what do you say we work together?
Jay::: Yeah, I say let's show 'em what we ninja are all about.
Garmadon::: They're getting away!
Mezmo::: Uh, why don't you use your Mega Weapon?
Garmadon::: Because I can only use it once before it saps all of my energy. Then who's going to slap you around to get this ship moving?!Get this ship moving!
Mezmo::: okay, you heard the Evil Lord. Full speed ahead! 
Garmadon::: No one shall defeat me, even in competition. I will win this race.
Announcer #1::: Looks like our leaders are just about to enter the second leg of the race into the Birchwood Forest!
Royal Blacksmiths::: You, dum-de-dum, you, Dum-de-dum you. . .Too big, too big. Too slow, too slow. We had a lead but let it go.
Cole:::Oh, man.
Kai::: We'll never get through those trees to catch up.
Lloyd::: I'll find a shortcut. Up, boy!Whoa!You actually went up.Follow me!Whoo-hoo!
Jay::: Wow, he's getting the hang of it.
Cole::: And it looks like we've made up the lost time.
Nuckal::: Working together!
Kruncha::: Not if we have anything to say about it.
Lloyd::: Whoa! 
Announcer #1::: Oh, a nasty crash. More racers are out of the race. Hope they're okay.
Announcer #2::: Yeah. But if they're not, stay tuned for the slow-motion replay.
Lloyd::: Are you okay there, fella?We got them back in the race.
Announcer #1::: Excuse us. But you're all friends of the boy Dragon rider, aren't ya? Tell us how you feel.
Dareth::: Oh, I feel terrible. This is all my fault. The only reason he and the ninja entered this race was to save my dojo. If they don't win, developers are gonna tear it down, leaving all my poor kids without a training center to help enrich their tiny little lives.
Crowd::: Dojo! Dojo! Dojo! Dojo!
Announcer #1::: I don't know if you can feel it up there in the booth, but down here, it appears the crowds have found their favorite racer: the ninja!
Announcer #2::: Oh, I feel it, alright. But they better buckle their seat belts because up next is the most dangerous part of the race: the Glacier Barrens!
Angered Villager::: Hey, watch it!
Skales:::I can't shake them! 
Acidicus::: They aren't interested in catching you.
Skales::: Those coppers just want to win the race.
Kai::: Finally. Nothing can stop us now.
Zane:::Oh no, we've used up all of our fuel. We're not gonna make it to the finish line.
Jay::: Oh, I don't want to say it, guys, but I think our goose is cooked.
Ed::: You guys look like you could use a hand there. We heard on the radio that you're all trying to save Dareth's dojo.
Edna::: Oh, yeah, we're so proud of you, son.
Jay::: Oh, thanks, mom, but we're out of gas.
Edna::: Ooh, then take ours.
Jay::: Huh? But how? If we stop, we'll lose the lead.
Ed:::Well, then we'll just have to do this the hard way, son.Take this end, son.
Jay:::Keep it steady. 
Ed::: Here you go, son.
Jay:::Ready, dad.
Garmadon::: We're not fast enough. We should be pulling away!
Mezmo::: But we're up to maximum speed.
Garmadon::: Then get rid of the excess weight.
Mezmo::: What excess weight?
Garmadon::: I order you to slow the ninja down!
Cole::: We've got company, boys.
Lizaru::: Skales?!
Skales::: Get off the windshield! I'm trying to win a race! 
Jay::: Ninja, go!Need some help, guys.
Zane:::We've got your back. Ninja, go! 
Cole:::Ninja, go! 
Jay::: Ninja, go! 
Rattla::: Look into my eyes, ninja.Oh, that is so gross.
Cole:::Hey, down here! 
Jay::: Now, Zane!
Zane:::Ninja, go! 
Nya::: Not again!
Dareth::: I can't take this anymore. 
Jay::: Wait! Stop!Oh, thank goodness you're okay.
Ed::: Oh, we're fine, son. Just wish I could say the same for the old jalopy.
Edna::: Yeah. Shame she didn't get to the finish line.
Jay::: I'll make sure a part of it will.
Jay::: Let's go. We've got a dojo to save.
Ed::: Go make us proud, son.
Cole::: Looks like it's just us and Garmadon.
Kai::: This time let's make sure the good guys don't finish last. 
Garmadon:::No! I hate those ninja. It's time. You think you can beat me, ninja? This race is mine! Hear me, Mega Weapon. I wish to rip open Ninjago and make an insurmountable obstacle that they can never surpass!
Kai::: Huh?
Jay::: Oh, that's totally cheating!
Zane::: Guys, it's impossible to cross that divide.
Garmadon::: I did it. Did you see that? I win! The dojo is doomed! 
Jay::: Oh, we're not gonna win now!
Kai::: Wait a minute. This ain't over.Everybody, hang on! 
Jay::: Uh, you do know we're heading straight for that cliff, right? You're sure that's a good idea?
Kai::: I haven't had time to think it through. Oh, what was it that Sensei said? You gotta have trust.
Cole::: Yeah, in each other, not in miracles!
Kai::: Oh, Nya, don't fail us now. Alright, NOW! 
All but Kai::: Ninja, go!
Garmadon:::No. No! NO!
Nya::: He pulled the lever!
Crowd, Wu, Nya, Dareth, Jeff, and Phil:::Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
Announcer #1::: It looks like it's going to be a photo finish.
Crowd::: Ninja! Ninja!Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
Garmadon:::I won. I won! Clearly I passed the finish line first!
Announcer #1::: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!The ninja! The ninja have won!
Jay::: Yeah! I knew it would bring us luck!
Garmadon::: No! That's not fair! That wasn't even part of the vehicle in the first place! It's not even street legal! My ship was—
Lloyd::: Your ship?I believe this belongs to us.
Garmadon::: No! No! No! 
Officer:::Alright, Garmadon, you're coming with us.
Skales::: Look who needs who now.
Nya::: Somehow, Sensei, I don't think that will be the last we're gonna see of him.
Dareth:::We did it! We did it! Ooh-hoo! We saved the dojo! Oh, look what I can do. CANNONBALL!
