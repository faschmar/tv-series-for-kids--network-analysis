Kai::: See?
Jay::: A single brick? Pft, I could break more than that.Hey!
Kai::: Prove it then. The ninja who can break the most bricks gets to have the last cookie.
Jay::: Deal!
Jay::: Three bricks!Hmm.
Kai::: Five! 
Jay:::Twenty!
Kai::: One hundred and one! 
Wu::: What is happening?!
Kai::: Oh, uh... it's just, um...
Jay::: Uh, training! Uh, getting extra practice in, you know, ninjas never quit.
Wu::: But the courtyard. Where did you even get all these bricks?My wall!
Nya::: What's going on? Did Jay and Kai mess up again?
Wu::: I instructed them to go into the yard and meditate on the six fundamental virtues of Spinjitzu, and instead they demolished my wall! 
Jay::: Oh, right, you did tell us to do something. The six what now?
Wu::: Virtues! Don't tell me you've forgotten.
Kai:::No way. We'd never forget the seven virtues.
Jay:::Six!
Kai::: Six.
Wu::: Then tell me what they are.
Kai::: Right, I will. Uh, okay. They are... important! Huh? That's what they are. Hehe.
Wu::: Tell them, Nya.
Nya::: Oh! Yeah. The six things. They're on the tip of my tongue.
Wu::: Don't any of you remember?
Wu::: Zane. You have a perfect electronic memory.
Zane::: Apologies, Master. I had to take portions of my memory offline in order to defrag them.
Wu:::Meditation position. Now!
Wu::: Curiosity.Balance.Wisdom.Honesty. 
Jay::: Hey!
Wu::: Generosity. Courage.These are the six fundamental virtues of Spinjitzu. Through these qualities, a true ninja is forged.Reflect on what I've just said. 
Nya:::Great job, guys. Now we've all got to deal with a grumpy Master Wu!What was that?
Zane::: Unidentified audio input.
Nya::: You've got to be at least a little curious.
Kai::: Yeah, but we should keep meditating. I don't want to make Master Wu any angrier than he already is.
Lloyd::: We're supposed to be meditating. Focus.
Nya:::I can't. I'm just dying to know what's going on. 
Ninja::: Ninja, go! 
Nya::: Master Wu!
Kai::: Whoa.
Nya::: The portal's closing!
Lloyd::: After Master Wu! Ninja, go!
