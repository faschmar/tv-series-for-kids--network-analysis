Nya::: Welcome back to our...
Jay and Nya::: Ninja Vlog!
Nya::: So we asked you to participate in our latest LEGO Life building challenge.
Jay::: And boy, did you deliver!
Nya::: For some reason, some were a bit... chicken-inspired?
Jay::: This is getting out of—Whoa! That is a cool jungle speeder!
Nya::: I know and look at this amazing rainbow bird!
Jay::: It's great! I mean it really is, but I think I'm a little more on board with this couch-carrying chicken robot.
Nya::: Jay...
Jay::: What? It seems like a good way to get around.
Nya::: Thank you all for your awesome island exploration vehicles.
Jay::: B-But wait till you see what I managed to get my hands on.
Nya::: We're just about to head into the jungle.
Jay::: I had to beg but jungle chopper. It's so perfect for jungle trails! I mean it's got the suspension, we're just going to sail over the roots like— 
Nya::: See, I'm not sure we need the surf glider. I mean it's detachable anyway.
Jay:::Nya? I have just one counterpoint.
Nya::: Hmm?
Jay::: It looks cool!
Nya::: Okay. It can stay.
Jay::: Hooray!
Nya::: Jay, get down!
Jay::: What is that?
Nya::: It's a dragon!
Jay::: Why do you sound so excited?
Nya::: Because it's cool!
Jay::: Cool?! That thing is probably looking for its dinner, and we're on the menu!
Nya::: I don't know, Jay. It seems harmless.
Jay::: What were you saying about harmless?
Nya::: It bit off an entire wheel of Lloyd's bike. Awesome!
Jay::: Awesome? Awesome?! Whoa whoa, no, no, no. You do realize it could easily just have been one of us flying away in those jaws?!
Nya::: Well, I can think of one thing worse.
Jay::: What?!
Nya::: Telling Lloyd we ruined his bike.
Jay::: Oh...
Jay::: Well, I can confirm that Lloyd's never letting me borrow his jungle chopper again.
Nya::: Well, I know something that can make you feel better.I've set up a meme challenge for the viewers at home and we can go over the results next time.
Jay::: Well, I guess that would make me feel a little better.
Nya::: Find out more on the LEGO Life app. Plus, I've uploaded a lightning-proof chicken sticker as a treat for you all.But that's all for this week.
Jay::: Join us next time when we'll be exploring more on the island.
Jay and Nya:::Bye!
Nya::: Don't worry, Jay. I'm sure Lloyd will get over his bike.
Jay::: Really? You think so? You think he might let me borrow it again in the future? N-Nya?
