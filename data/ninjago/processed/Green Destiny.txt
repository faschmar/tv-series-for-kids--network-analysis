Nya::: Get us out of here, Dareth!
Dareth::: I don't exactly have a free hand at the moment.
Lloyd::: Just keep swinging!
Wu::: Break away!
Jay::: What's left of it.
Kai::: Let's just hope our friends are okay. 
Nya::: You're coming in loud and clear, brother.
Jay::: Nya?! Oh, you're alright.
Nya::: Oh... I don't know about that, but we could use a little help.
Zane::: I've located their transmission.
Wu::: Lead the way. 
Dareth::: The ninja are back!
Nya::: And with very large dragons. 
Lloyd:::We did it! We held out! 
Nya::: Is that?
Lloyd::: Master Wu?
Wu::: When I was an old man, I was wise to avoid a fight. But today, I'm not an old man. 
Nya::: Yeah!
Lloyd, Nya, Kai, Jay, Zane, and Cole:::Yeah! Alright!
Cole::: Oh, look at us! The gang is back!
Zane::: But where are P.I.X.A.L. and Misako?
Lloyd::: Locked away in Kryptarium. 
Kai::: Skylor! What happened?
Nya::: She tapped into Garmadon's power. It was too much for her to bear.
Lloyd::: But I think we can save her, if we stop my father.
Wu::: Has your power returned?
Lloyd::: No, but Mystake taught me power isn't what makes the Green Ninja. It's the person behind the power.
Wu::: She's no longer with us, is she?
Dareth::: You know, we wouldn't be here without that crazy, little woman. In honor of her, I recommend we drop old-school and kick butt!
Lloyd::: Dareth is right. We do this for Mystake, and everyone else hurt by my father.
Wu::: Ninja, can you stop the Colossus?
Cole::: We've learned a thing or two about taking down giants. 
Wu::: Nya, you and Dareth, keep Skylor safe. Lloyd... you must confront your father.
Lloyd::: I've survived without my power, but I don't know if I can stop him.
Wu::: You may be without power, but you are not without me.
Lloyd:::Ninja!
Kai, Jay, Zane, and Cole:::Go!
Dareth::: See you on the other side. 
Lloyd::: What's wrong?
Wu::: My brother. I feel his rage.
Garmadon::: I feel you, brother. I see you brought the ninja, but it's too late. Feel the wrath, of my True Potential!
Kai::: Looks like there's a few more who are unable to evacuate.
Jay::: Giant snakes, overlords, and now this? Why do people insist on living in this city?
Cole::: Because old friends are worth fighting for! 
Jay::: I know. The commute is terrible. 
People:::Yeah! 
Rufus:::Super heroes do exist.
Gayle::: Whatever happened to freedom of the press? 
Dareth:::Aha! When you mess with Gayle Gossip, you mess with... the Brown Ninja.
SoG Member::: You hear that, fellas? The Brown Ninja made a mess! 
Dareth::: Huh? What? No, no, no, that's not what Iâ€”No! That is gross, you twisted my words. Laugh all you want. It's time to wipe out crime!Please tell me you got that. 
Gayle::: Hey, wait! Who are you?
Dareth::: Heh. Your biggest fan. 
Chopper Maroon::: The ninja! They're back. The boss needs all hands on deck!
Misako::: The ninja!
P.I.X.A.L.::: They've returned?
Ronin::: Well, I'll be.
Karlof::: They need our help. The Resistance never quits!The Resistance never quits!
Ronin::: The Resistance never quits!
Everyone in Prison:::The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits!The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! 
The Resistance::: The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits!
Ronin:::You ain't got the Vengestone to protect you now. 
The Resistance::: The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits! The Resistance never quits!
Lloyd::: Tell me you know how to defeat him.
Wu::: Only a fool thinks he knows everything. I admit I know nothing! How this will end, is beyond me.
Cole::: Okay, we got the people out of the way. Time to deal with the elephant in the roof!
Zane::: That is not an elephant, Cole.
Kai::: We got it, Zane. Just train your chain on the big guy. Remember what Faith taught us. We do this together.
Jay::: The bigger they are, the harder they fall!
Garmadon:::My family.My enemies. You may have Father's sword, but now my power will surpass his. 
Wu::: What have you become?!
Garmadon::: Time has treated you well. You think Father's sword can hurt me?
Wu:::No. But it can hold you!
Garmadon::: Don't you get it?!The fight is what fuels me!
Wu::: Lloyd, take cover! 
Cole:::What was that?
Kai::: Look out! 
Wu:::Lloyd.
Garmadon:::Hello, son. And farewell. How long can you endure?
Lloyd::: I thought the fight is what fueled you. Is this how you fight?
Garmadon:::If only Father could see me now.
Zane::: He's too considerable to take down.
Kai::: And he's got good reflexes!
Cole::: Guys, I'm nearly out of chain.
Jay::: Me too.
Kai::: Even if we had more, it's not thick enough to stop it.
Zane::: Then perhaps next time we should use thicker chains.
Cole::: There ain't gonna be a next time!
Jay::: And Zane's the smart one.
Kai::: No, he's onto something. Look at all that chain. If we can use it, we could lock it down.
Cole::: And who of us is stupid enough to jump on that thing?
Kai::: Cole, say no more. 
Cole::: That's my last one.Make it count!
Lloyd::: This isn't what your father wanted Ninjago to be. He left his world to make a better place. He fought to restore the balance!
Garmadon::: Ninjago isn't built on balance! It's built on... power! And controlled by he who possesses it!
Lloyd:::No matter what you've done, or what you've become, I have to believe this isn't you. You can change!
Garmadon::: Youthful ignorance! People don't change. They only reveal who they truly are!
Lloyd::: You're wrong! 
Garmadon::: Get up and fight me. Get up! Fight me!
Lloyd::: No. It's the fight that fuels you. I can not fight you... but I can resist you. 
Kai::: Keep distracting it!
Lloyd::: I can not fight you, but I can resist you.
Garmadon::: Stop saying that!
Lloyd::: I can not fight you, but I can resist you. I can not fight you, but I can resist you!
Jay::: It's working! Get off of there, Kai! 
Cole::: It's breaking free!
Zane::: It is weakened.
Cole::: It didn't fall hard enough.
Kai::: Oh, come on!
Wu::: Maybe I can offer some metal!
Nya::: I hope you didn't think we forgot about you.
Kai::: Hey!
Misako::: Tie it down!
Cole::: Here we go again. The bigger they are...
Zane::: ... the harder they fall!
Lloyd::: I can not fight you, but I can resist you. 
Garmadon::: My power... where is it?
Skylor:::What happened?
Kai::: We won.
Garmadon::: You still have to finish it.
Lloyd::: It's over.
Garmadon::: It's not over. But when they come, it will be. My power... It was the only thing that could battle back the darkness from devouring us all. But you took that away. And now everything will be gone.
Lloyd::: Who will come?
Garmadon::: You'll see. And when they come, nothing will be left.
Commissioner::: Well, I hope you scum took care of Kryptarium. I know some cells that have opened up.
Lloyd::: Do you have room for one more? 
Kai::: Lloyd!
Jay::: Man! I can't believe it! Oh, yeah!
Nya::: Your power is back!
Jay::: And Garmadon's power is gone. The balance is restored.
Commissioner::: Thank you, ninja, for saving Ninjago. Again.
Garmadon::: They will come!
Kai::: Just another day in Ninjago. I wonder what tomorrow holds?
Jay::: It holds a lot of work, Kai.
Cole::: We saved Ninjago. Can't we get a day off?
Lloyd::: We helped break it, we help rebuild it.
Wu::: Ninja! Trouble!Come quick!
Kai::: Already?
Jay::: I'm still sore from our last adventure. 
Music::: Go!
Commissioner::: I already thanked you, but the people want to thank you also.
The Fold::: It's time for training and we're getting started. It's on, you know. And we wanna see you whip and shout it. We rock, you roll! They say, go slow. And everything just stands so still. We say go, go. We're ready for the fight, we know the drill. Monday morning and we feel defeated, seems so long ago...
Lloyd::: She has to leave?
Wu::: This isn't their realm. She'll come back, when it's time. Right now, they need to return home. Thank you, my friend.
Lloyd::: The First Spinjitzu Master tried to make the perfect realm, and because of my father, there may never be lasting peace.
Wu::: Our world isn't perfect, but that doesn't mean we give up on it.
Lloyd::: Tell me, Master. Back in the First Realm, did you see the Oni?
Wu::: They were all gone when we arrived. To where, I do not know. What concerns you, Master Lloyd?
Lloyd::: If my father is right, I think they are coming.
