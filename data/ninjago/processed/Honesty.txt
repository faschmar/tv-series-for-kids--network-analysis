Kai::: Aww, man! I did not miss this place.
Jay::: Seriously! This place is the worst! Okay, I have no idea where we are.
Kai::: In the Ice Emperor's palace.
Ice Emperor::: You have been summoned for competition!
Kai::: Zane, why are you pretending to be the Ice Emperor again?
Jay::: Yeah! Quit being a weirdo and knock this off!
Zane::: You are in error!That is not me!
Jay::: What? How? You're the Ice Emperor!
Zane::: Clearly not right now.
Jay::: Point taken.
Ice Emperor::: Ninja are said to have many virtues. You will engage in a joust to determine just what those are.
Kai::: Uh, can't we just juggle or something? Jay's a pretty good ventriloquist.
Jay::: No I'm not!
Kai::: Shh! I'm trying to lie our way out of this!
Jay::: The lie about my ventriloquism skills is easily disprovable! And you shouldn't lie anyway.
Kai::: Since when did you become Mr. Truth Fanatic?
Ice Emperor::: You will each joust one of my Ice Samurai without the use of dragon flight. If you defeat both of them -- I will free your friends and allow you to go through this portal to find your Master Wu. But if you lose -- I will turn you into frozen statues for all eternity.
Kai::: So that's a no on the juggling.
Ice Emperor::: Enough! Prepare for battle!
Ice Emperor::: Begin!
Ice Emperor::: The victor is Kai.
Kai::: Yeah!
Ice Emperor::: If you ninja win the next joust, you gain your freedom and the portal.
Kai::: No pressure.
Ice Emperor::: Begin!
Kai::: Come on, Jay, you've got this!
Kai::: Oh right!
Jay::: I was knocked off too! They couldn't see it!
Kai::: Shh! Don't bring that up! For all anyone knows, we won. Fairly!
Ice Emperor::: You have bested my warriors in an honest joust. They will pay the price for their defeat.
Jay::: Stop!
Kai:::What are you doing?!
Jay::: No innocent should suffer because of lies! I was also knocked from my steed. I did not win.
Kai::: Great time to develop principles, Jay!
Ice Emperor:::No. You are indeed the victor. I was aware you were knocked off. But this was not a test of jousting skill. It was a test of honesty.
Zane::: Nice work, Jay!
Ice Emperor::: Your Master Wu needs your help. Go now. Go to his aid.
Zane::: Come on, everyone. Let's go!
Kai::: Still think the ventriloquism would have worked.
Jay::: Ventriloquism. Yeah, I guess. Goes without saying!
