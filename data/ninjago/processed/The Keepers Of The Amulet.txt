Nya::: What's wrong?
Lloyd::: I thought I saw something up there. An animal.
Jay::: We're in the jungle, Lloyd. I'm sure there's lots of animals.
Cole::: Hey, did anyone bring a snack? I'm starving.
Jay::: I did.
Cole::: Great!
Jay::: But it fell in the ocean.
Cole::: Oh, thanks for getting my hopes up.
Lloyd::: What kind of animals are there on this island, Twitchy?
Twitchy Tim::: Uh, poisonous pythons, poisonous jaguars, poisonous frogs, poisonous eels, poisonous piranhas, poisonous birds!
Nya::: Poisonous birds?
Twitchy Tim::: Pretty much everything on this island is poisonous! Especially those berries. 
Lloyd::: Whatever is on this island, it won't stop us from finding my mom and Master Wu.
Nya::: And Clutch Powers.
Lloyd::: Huh? Oh yeah, right. And Clutch.Let's leave the Jungle Choppers here. There's no way we're gonna drive through that.
Kai:::Ha, you weren't kidding. You really are hungry. I can hear your stomach growling from here.
Cole::: Uh, that wasn't my stomach.
Kai::: Well, if it wasn't your stomach, then who's - 
Lloyd::: What are you doing?
Twitchy Tim::: Assuming survival position!
Nya::: Dragon!
Kai::: Ninja, -
Nya::: No, wait! Look at him. I don't think he's dangerous.
Cole:::Is that a coconut?Aww.
Nya::: I think he wants to play! Fetch! 
Zane::: He appears quite docile.
Lloyd::: Yeah, look, it might be friendly and all, but -
Jay::: Zippy! Oh, let's call him Zippy!
Lloyd::: Okay. Zippy might be friendly and all, but we don't have time to be playing fetch with dragons. We're trying to find my mom and Master Wu.
Nya::: Are you sure? He's so cute! Okay, fine. Zippy, look. You're a real good boy, but we're on an important mission, and you might be a little huge and loud for us, okay? Super fetch! 
Twitchy Tim::: Survival mode successful again!
Lloyd::: Let's go, quick!
Kai::: Ahem.
Cole::: Yes! Finally! What?
Kai::: Is it possible for you to think about anything except food?
Cole::: Yes. I'm thirsty too.Give me back my drink, thief! Hey! Aah!Ew! You can keep it.
Zane::: This is most strange.
Cole::: What's wrong?
Zane::: The trail appears to stop here. I see evidence of a struggle.
Lloyd::: What kind of struggle? 
Twitchy Tim::: Survival mode!
Nya::: Will you guys relax?It's just a statue! See?Aah!
Kai::: Uh, the statue has brothers!
Lloyd::: Ninja, go!
Cole:::What?
Kai::: It just ate my fire blast and spat it back!
Zane::: They appear to be channeling our elemental energy!Jay, do not use your -
Twitchy Tim::: Escape maneuvers! 
Kai::: I don't think lightning's only your thing anymore!
Jay::: Yeah! I know!
Lloyd::: Look out!
Nya::: Oh no. Where's Lloyd?
Jay::: And the other guy. Oh what'd he say, Nutty Ned?
Nya::: Twitchy Tim! Aah! 
Jay:::Nya!
Kai::: They're still coming. What now?
Nya::: Look. There! 
Jay::: Are you kidding? A rope bridge? Rope bridges always break, and we'll be barely holding on, dangling over certain doom!
Zane::: Admittedly, that does happen to us more frequently than standard statistical models would suggest. Still, I evaluate it to be a risk worth taking. 
Jay::: Oh, I'm gonna regret this!
Nya::: Keep moving, Jay!
Jay::: It's gonna fall, it's gonna fall, it's gonna fall, it's gonna fall! 
Cole::: Maybe open your eyes now.
Jay::: Haha! No way! We actually made it all the way across a rope bridge without it breaking! Haha! I guess everything's gonna be -see? I told you! What was that noise?
Zane::: It sounded like some form of electric - 
Jay::: Zane? Zane? Nya? Kai? Cole? 
Lloyd::: Huh, well, running away isn't usually my style, but I guess it was my only choice.
Twitchy Tim::: Really? Because running away is almost always my first choice. 
Nya::: Huh?
Kai::: Hey, untie me!
Nya::: Kai? Are you okay?
Kai::: Nya! Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Where are they taking us? Can you see anything?
Nya::: I have no idea. I can't see a thing.
Jay:::Hey! Watch it with that! Ow! Okay, I'm going, I'm going!
Nya::: What do you want? Why did you attack us?
Kai::: We're not here to steal anything. We're here to rescue our friends.
Mammatus::: You do not deceive me. Others have come before you. Others have tried, and failed, for we uphold our vow. We are the Keepers of the Amulet!
Jay::: What amulet?
Cole::: I'm guessing that one.
Mammatus::: It is the Storm Amulet, pried from the head of the sleeper in the deep, she who existed long before time had a name. Wojira!
Keepers::: Wojira!
Mammatus::: We took a sacred oath to keep the Storm Amulet safe from those who would seize it. We harnessed the power of lightning, and became one with the storm. Our forefathers kept the oath, and their forefathers, all the way back to the beginning.
Zane::: I can assure you, we have no intention of purloining your artifact.
Mammatus::: You have seen it. You know too much.
Jay::: But then why did you show it to us?
Mammatus::: There is only one way to ensure it remains safe now.
Cole::: Why do I feel like I'm not gonna like this?
Mammatus::: You will be our prisoners, forever!
Keepers::: Wojira!
Cole::: Yeah, I don't like it.
