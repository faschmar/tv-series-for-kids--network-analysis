Lloyd::: We've gotta get out of here!
Nya::: This isn't gonna hold!
Jay::: There's no handle! How do we open this thing?
Lloyd::: Look for some kind of switch or pressure plate!
Maya::: Ugh, there's nothing! Lloyd, look out!
Benthomaar::: Are you okay?
Nya::: Who are you?
Benthomaar::: Benthomaar, the King's son. His... adopted son.
Lloyd::: We didn't attack the King!
Benthomaar::: I know. It was Kalmaar.
Nya::: Is the King... 
Benthomaar::: He's... he's... 
Nya::: I'm sorry. 
Benthomaar::: We don't have long. Follow me! I have to get you out of here.
Jay::: Where are you taking us?
Benthomaar::: The hangar bay. Your vessel was taken there.Wait here. I'll get them to leave.
Jay::: Are we sure we can trust this guy?
Nya::: No, but he didn't have to help us.
Zane::: What did you tell them?
Benthomaar::: I told them that Kalmaar sent for them. By the time he finds out I lied, we'll be long gone. Follow me.Oh. Hello. Um, these are my friends, from out of town!
Jay::: Don't worry, I got this. Hi, we're visiting from another underwater city! Heh, not the surface. It's called, um, uh, Bubbletubblepopolis! Yeah! You know, it's pretty far away, you probably haven't heard of it.I think they bought it.Whoa! This is no way to treat a tourist!The citizens of Bubbletubblepopolis will not be pleased! This will affect... your tourism!
Nya::: Mom! 
Maya:::What?
Nya::: Mm, nothing.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I'll start up the sub!
Kalmaar::: That's more like it.
Gripe::: Kalmaar!Forgive me, my Lord, I did not intend to startle you.
Kalmaar::: What do you want?
Gripe::: Sir, the Ripper Sharks were released as you commanded.
Kalmaar::: Good. Bring me whatever is left of the ninja.
Gripe::: Unfortunately, Sir, the Ripper Sharks seem to have been... unable to locate the ninja.
Kalmaar::: What?
Gripe::: The ninja have disappeared.
Kalmaar::: Disappeared? What do you mean, disappeared?
Maaray Guard::: You sent for us, Sir?
Kalmaar::: What in the Endless Sea are you babbling about?
Maaray Guard::: We were guarding the hangar bay and Benthomaar dismissed us and said you sent for us.
Kalmaar::: The hangar? To the hangar bay! Benthomaar is in league with the surface dwellers!
Kalmaar::: Stop them! Fire!
Lloyd::: Go! Get out of here!
Nya::: What about you?
Lloyd::: I'll catch up! Go!
Automated voice::: Warning. Hull damage, 70 percent integrity. 60 percent. 50 percent. 40 percent. 30 percent. 20...
Nya::: Lloyd! We... are... leaving!
Kalmaar::: You will rue the day you ever set foot in the sea!
Lloyd::: I'm already ruing it! 
Kalmaar::: Don't just stand there, they're getting away! After them!
Jay::: P.I.X.A.L., reduce speed! We're losing Lloyd!
Lloyd::: No, keep going! I'll catch up!Uh oh.
Jay::: Sonar contact! Six signals behind us, approaching fast!
Lloyd::: P.I.X.A.L., punch it!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Accelerating to maximum speed.
Kalmaar::: Blast them from the sea! 
Jay::: Torpedo in the water! Bearing zero zero nine!
Zane::: Hard left rudder. West two two nine. Make your depth nine thousand!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Hold on, Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Look out!
Kalmaar::: Fire! What are you waiting for?
Gripe::: But the city! If we miss, we would strike our own.
Kalmaar::: Fire again! 
Jay::: Another torpedo!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Hard left rudder. Hold on!
Benthomaar::: There's an opening there. A tunnel. If we can reach it, we might be able to escape.
Jay::: New course. Two one seven. Full speed ahead!
Kalmaar::: Goodbye, Benthomaar. Fire!
Jay::: Three torpedoes, five hundred yards and closing!
Zane::: Time to impact?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Ten seconds.
Zane::: Range to tunnel?
P.I.X.A.L.::: One hundred yards.
Jay::: We're not gonna make it!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Launching counter measures.Ten seconds to impact. Nine seconds. Eight. Seven. Six.
Gripe::: What?
Kalmaar::: 
Nya::: Lloyd, are you okay?
Lloyd::: Yeah, I'm fine. But the Hydro Bounty ' s gonna need a new paint job. It's a mess out here.
Nya::: Benthomaar, these are my friends. Zane, P.I.X.A.L., Jay, Lloyd, and my mother, Maya.
Benthomaar::: It is good to meet you.
Lloyd::: Yeah, same here.
Jay::: Um, please don't take this the wrong way, but why exactly are you helping us?
Benthomaar::: Kalmaar seeks to awaken Wojira and destroy the surface world. I promised my father I would do everything in my power to stop him.
Nya::: He can't awaken Wojira without the second amulet, and we know where it is.
Benthomaar::: Then I suggest we get there first. This is one race we cannot afford to lose.
Nya::: We won't. Not if we have anything to say about it. P.I.X.A.L., set course for the Island of the Keepers. Full speed ahead.
