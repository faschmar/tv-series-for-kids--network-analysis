Jay::: Uh, teensy problem, guys. I've got a bad leak and no control. Lloyd? Zane? Anyone?Okay. Okay. Looks like we're going for a swim. Eject!Oh come on, why won't you eject! Oh, not good. Think! What would Zane do? Actually, no. Think, what would Kai do.Come on ...
Wu::: Everyone, listen up! Nya's not going to hold off Wojira for much longer. We need to regroup!
Lloyd::: Any suggestions, Zane? What's our best course of action?
Zane::: I have run three million simulations, and the outcome of all of them is the same. We will lose.
Kai::: Ninja never quit!
Wu::: No, but a wise ninja knows when to retreat, and now is that time. Everyone, fall back.
Gripe::: Fire!
Kai::: You heard Master Wu. Let's get out of here!
Wu::: P.I.X.A.L., we have to get these people to safety.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Kalmaar is unlikely to allow us to retreat, and at this speed, we have little chance of outrunning him.
Wu::: Hmm.There! Set course for that building and turn on the autopilot. I have an idea.
Nya::: Thisisn't over, Kalmaar! I'll be back! 
Kalmaar::: Ugh, don't let her get away. After her! After her!
Cole::: Let's get him out of here.
Benthomaar:::Hang on!
Kalmaar::: There! The cowards are retreating! Destroy the ship! Sink that vessel!It's on autopilot.Find them. Find the ninja!
Nya:::What happened?
Cole::: He's hurt. He inhaled a bunch of water.
Wu::: Get him inside, quickly! And hide those vehicles!
Kalmaar::: Nya! I will find you. There's no way you can hide! This world is no longer yours. It's mine!
Kai::: How is he?
Zane::: Jay has a significant amount of sea water in his lungs. Unless the water is removed, his condition will worsen.
Kai::: Uh, what about Nya? Maybe she can draw out the water.
Wu::: She has tried. The water in his lungs does not respond to her.
Lloyd::: We need to get him to a hospital!
Kai::: How are we gonna move him with that thing out there hunting us?
Cole::: Maybe we can get help? From Princess Vania or somebody.
Zane::: Our communicators do not have that range.
Nya::: Bentho, how did Nyad defeat Wojira? In the story you told me.
Benthomaar::: She became one with the sea.
Nya::: But how exactly?
Benthomaar::: She opened herself up to the full power of the ocean. She merged with it.Do not think of such things. Nyad may have defeated Wojira, but she lost herself. What she did ... could not be undone. She vanished.
Gripe::: My Lord! Still no sign of the ninja.
Kalmaar::: They are here. Keep searching! Search every one of these buildings if you must.
Gripe::: Yes, my Lord! In the meantime, we have found someone who claims to know them.
Kalmaar::: What? Who?
Gripe::: He refuses to speak, but we found this in his possession. 
Kalmaar::: Take me to him. At once.
Nya::: I wish we had more time, but we never seem to get a break. 
Wu::: Jay?
Lloyd::: What's happening?
Zane::: The water in his lungs is being drawn out!
Cole::: How?
Benthomaar::: No!
Wu::: What is she doing?
Benthomaar::: She's attempting to merge with the sea. But it is something that can never be undone! She will be lost forever!
Wu:::We must stop her! 
Jay::: What?Nya?Nya, wait!Whoa!
Wu::: Nya. Nya! Come back!
Benthomaar::: She did it.
Jay::: She's going after Kalmaar. She's going to finish it. And I'm gonna help her.
Wu::: Jay, you can barely stand.
Jay::: I'm going.
Wu::: Very well. We will all go.
Kalmaar::: Who are you?
Commissioner::: I'm the police commissioner.
Kalmaar::: Commissioner?
Gripe::: I believe it is a potentate of some kind. Like a king.
Commissioner::: I'm a law officer. It's my job to protect the people and property of this city.
Kalmaar::: Then I would say you have done a poor job. Where are the ninja? Tell me, and I will show you mercy.
Commissioner::: Even if I knew, I'd never tell you.
Kalmaar::: I will ask one last time. Where are the ninja? 
Gripe::: What is it?
Kalmaar::: It's her! The girl!
Nya::: My name isn't "girl". It's Nya. And you're going to wish you never crossed me!
