Garmadon::: We underestimate the importance of balance. When it's there, we're at peace. When something is off, everything falls. Ninjago is no different. It put too much faith in technology, allowing the Overlord to return, and because of your friends, now the world is without power. When one relies on something too much, we become weak, vulnerable, imbalanced. In order to find your full potential and unlock your true power, you must find your own balance.
Lloyd::: I'm already the Golden Ninja, how much more power do I need?
Garmadon::: You've only scratched the surface! You have the potential to move mountains. Power of the First Spinjitzu Master!
Lloyd::: The Nindroids. Why can't we go back?
Garmadon::: Essentially? Until the Overlord is fully erased from the system, we must not go back, but forward!
Lloyd::: 
Garmadon::: If you can't move mountains, I guess we'll have to move over mountains.
Lloyd::: Oh yeah?
Garmadon::: And this next one looks particularly steep.
Worker #1::: Over here! I found him!Are you all right, Mr. Borg?
Cyrus::: Yes, yes but how long have I been out?
Worker #1::: Quite a while, sir. We've been without power for a few days.
Cyrus::: The hard drive: It's missing! Have the ninja returned with the Techno Blades? Please, it's very important!
Worker #2::: Uh, no. There's been no one else inside the building.
Cyrus::: Wu . . . He was right here! Where did he go? And who would take the hard drive when the Overlord virus is still on it? Oh, so many questions, so few answers.
Overlord::: Where am I?! The ninja destroyed all of the power. How have you saved me?
Stranger::: Electro-Cobrai. Though extremely rare, they're extremely useful.
Overlord::: Who are are you? What do you want from me?
Stranger::: Nothing but a small favor after returning you to power. You do still want to become flesh, if I'm not mistaken?
Overlord::: Yes, of course, but I need the Golden Ninja.
Stranger::: You'll get your hands on him in time. Our power is limited, we must be wise with our next move. Ninjago is vast, the Golden Ninja could be anywhere. And still, the ninja have the only weapons that could erase you.The old man knows everything about the ninja. All of their secrets. All of their hideouts. He will find them in no time.
Cole::: We've been digging for so long, I think I forgot what we're looking for!
Kai and Cole::: 
Jay::: We shut off the power thinking we could just waltz in but no. We didn't stop to think we were a bajillion miles away. Hey! A compact converted jiggly compressor!
Kai and Cole::: 
Kai::: I'm starting to think they're just making this stuff up.
Nya::: You sure you want to do this? Modifying your original design could have ... unintentional consequences.
Zane::: She risked her life for me. It's the least I could do to get her back.
Zane::: You are the only one who knows Borg's system. You are vital to the mission. And, you are vital to me.
Edna::: Ooh. Robot love. Call me a sucker, but if they have half of what you and Jay have—
P.I.X.A.L.::: Nya and Jay? Judging from Perfect Match compatibility, perhaps Nya and Cole would be a closer comparison.
Edna::: Nya and Cole are a better match?
Zane::: Don't you mean Jay? Perhaps her processor was damaged.
P.I.X.A.L::: My processor is fully operational. The Perfect Match for Nya isn't Jay, but Cole.
Jay::: Cole's her perfect match?
Nya::: Jay...
Cole::: Ha, it's so quiet in here. What did I miss? Another signature Jay Walker gut buster?
Jay::: Oh, you backstabbing, no good . . . YAAAHH!! 
Cole::: What's wrong with you? 
Kai:::I hope Lloyd is faring better than us.
Lloyd::: Hey! Who needs bridges when you can manifest a Golden Dragon to—
Garmadon::: You rely too much on your Golden Power. Let this be a lesson. Center yourself and move the mountain with your mind.
Lloyd::: What? Move that? Are you kidding?
Garmadon::: Find your balance. Concentrate.
Lloyd::: This is pointless. Especially when I can do this!I'm not the First Spinjitzu Master, and I never wanted to be. I'm the Golden Ninja!
Garmadon:::I know. I was once like this too.
Jay::: Oh, you know why you're the Black Ninja? 'Cause it's the color of your heart!
Cole::: Oh yeah? Well what's the point in being a Blue Ninja? Unless you're trying to hide out for some goofy clown college!
Jay::: Ooh! You take that back! There are some reputable performers that attend clown college!
Cole::: I don't see why you want to settle this arm wrestling. You know I have super strength!
Jay::: Oh yeah? Well I'm super hooped! And I haven't brushed my teeth in a week! 
Nya::: This macho stuff is making you both look like fools. Maybe you belong together!
Kai::: What was that?
Ed::: The machines haven't worked since the outage. What's powering it?
Kai::: Nindroids! Better question is, what's powering them?
P.I.X.A.L.::: They're after the Techno Blades.
Cryptor::: Hahaha! 
Jay::: Yeah, well they nearly hit my mother!
Edna::: Ooh, don't worry about us, sweetie. We prepare for every type of situation.
Jay::: You make one for me?
Edna::: Uh, sorry, honey. You hardly ever come to visit.
Ed::: Yeah, good luck, kiddo. And watch over the junk while we're gone, will you? 
Cryptor::: Argh!
Jay::: I blame you for this!
Cole::: What did I do? You were the one who wanted to stay in a scrapheap full of Nindroids!
Kai::: Enough, you two! We may not have our Elemental Powers, but we still have our Spinjitzu!Are you gonna be okay?
P.I.X.A.L.::: I may not be built to fight, but my protective reflexes should suffice.
Nya::: Great! Cause you're gonna need 'em!
All::: Ninja, Go!
Cryptor::: Uh oh.
Zane:::I couldn't do Spinjitzu!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Your heart. Dividing it must have inhibited your fighting ability.
Zane::: I guess I have poor timing.
Jay::: We have to help Zane!
Cole::: Finally, something we agree on!
Jay and Cole::: Whoa!
Cole::: We're trapped!
Jay::: And with my own worst enemy!I'm too cute to be squashed!
Cole::: Hey, someone stop this thing!
Nya:::Bad Nindroid, bad Nindroid!
Kai::: They're trapped!
Kai::: Sensei, what have they done to you?
Wu::: Yaahh!
Kai:::Nya, you have to stop the junk compactor.
Nya::: I'm on it! Oh, no!
Cole::: Someone stop this thing!
Nya::: I can't override it!
Jay::: Well you'd better, because if you don't, Cole and I are gonna get real close. You said we belong together, but not permanently!
Cole::: I'm not strong enough!
Nya::: Seriously? A blue or black wire. I have to cut one of these wires to shut it down, but cut the wrong one and it may crush you guys instantly!
Jay::: Ooh, choose blue, Nya! You know blue! You're comfortable with blue!
Cole::: Choose black! Black is not blue!
Jay::: Oh, I'm gonna turn you black and blue!
Cole::: No time for that!
Jay::: I thought you were supposed to be strong.
Cole::: And I thought we were a team.
Nya::: Black or blue? Uh, why is it so hard to choose?
Jay::: Just cut one already!!!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Zane!
Cryptor::: Hahaha!
Nindroids::: Hahaha!
Kai::: Guys? A little help?
Wu::: Yaahh!!!
Cryptor::: Junk him.
P.I.X.A.L.::: No!That was never in my program. Your heart improved my fighting ability!
Cryptor::: Hahaha! He needs a little girl to protect him?
Zane::: Our shared reflexes. . . .
P.I.X.A.L.::: Work as one!
Zane::: As if we were made. . . .
P.I.X.A.L.::: To fight together!
P.I.X.A.L. and Zane::: Ninja, go!
Jay::: I take back everything I said!
Cole::: No, you were right. I could have been a better friend. I had no clue!
Nya::: Black or blue? 
Cole::: Nya, you did it!
Jay::: Ooh! Which color did you choose?
Nya::: Like I'll ever tell.
Jay::: Huh?
Nya::: Come on!
Kai::: Ah!
Cole::: Sensei Wu!
Jay::: What happened to him?
Kai::: He's turned evil! Help me!
Wu::: Yaah!
Cole::: But he's our Sensei!
Kai::: Not anymore.
Cole::: More like Tech Wu.
Jay::: Bad Sensei, bad!
Jay::: I hate to say it, but you deserved that a little.
Cole::: Haha! Right back at ya.
Nya::: I got this! Aaah!
Zane::: Sorry, Sensei. 
Kai::: Ha! I always knew those two had a magnetic attraction.
Nya::: Really?
Jay::: Woah! Who is that?
Wu::: Grrr. . . .
Stranger::: Enough. The Overlord will be pleased.
Wu::: Grrr. . . .
Jay::: Uh! Seriously, who the heck was that guy?
Nya::: Or gal.
Kai::: Whoever it is, he turned our sensei against us.
Cole::: And if we want to save him, we'll need to find out who this stranger is.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Perhaps I could have that answer for you in a few moments.
Cole::: What is it?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Hmm. . . .
Jay::: It's obviously a clue, dirt clod.
Cole::: I know it's a clue, zap trap. But it's so small, I just want to know what—
Nya::: Stop it, you two. P.I.X.A.L., can you analyze it?
P.I.X.A.L.::: The sample is far too small, but given time, I should have an answer.
Zane::: Then we should waste no more time and get back to the city. I'll use my Falcon Vision to warn Lloyd of our findings.
Nya::: I thought taking the power out would give us the upper hand, but now that they have it and we don't. I guess the power has only shifted.
Kai::: Don't worry, sis, we'll get Sensei back.
Lloyd::: Wish you still had four hands? It would've come in handy.
Garmadon::: Your potential is great, not your sense of humor.
Lloyd::: Heh, heh, heh. Still won't let me use the Golden Dragon?
Garmadon::: Still won't. If you want to harness the power of the First Spinjitzu Master, you must focus on your balance, and find your center.
Lloyd:::Uh, dad?
Garmadon::: A Ravture youngling. Don't touch him. It needs to learn to fly on its own. Keep climbing. Slowly.
Garmadon::: What have you done? It's going to know someone has touched its young!
Lloyd::: It? Who?
Garmadon::: Daddy.
Lloyd::: He was going to fall. I was trying to help.
Garmadon::: Unless you speak ravture, there's no use trying to explain. Hurry! We need to climb to shelter! There!
Lloyd::: You're not gonna fall on my watch!
Garmadon::: Your compassion is not helping. 
Lloyd::: Dad!
Garmadon::: I take it back. I do want my four hands.
Garmadon::: No! Do not use your power as a crutch. It will only weaken you. He's circling back. 
Lloyd::: Dad! No! 
Garmadon::: Son!You just moved a mountain, son.
Lloyd::: No!
Garmadon::: You're not the only one that's grown up.
Lloyd:::After you.
Lloyd::: Hey, the ninja have sent a message.
Nya:::Lloyd, we've some bad news. We've had a run in with a mysterious someone who has found a new way to power Nindroids.
Jay:::And he turned Sensei Wu evil. He had a black beard!
Nya:::We have a suspicion this person may have stolen the hard drive containing the Overlord and has reawakened him.
Kai:::And now that the hard drive has gone missing, we can't reboot the system. Our Techno Blades are useless.
Nya:::But the stranger left a clue: a white scale. That's right, we think he may be Serpentine. We're headed to New Ninjago City to get to the bottom of this. We thought you should know so you can keep your distance. Hope you're faring better than we are. We'll stay in contact if we learn anything new. Over and out.
Lloyd::: Whoa. Serpentine?
Garmadon::: We must not go back, but forward. Hiroshi's Labyrinth: miles of jungle so dense, all who enter are never found. We must not rest.
Lloyd::: Okay. Let's get lost.
Overlord::: You failed. Not even you could stop them.
Stranger::: I wasn't trying to stop them, I was luring them into a greater trap.
Garmadon:::Hiroshi's Labyrinth. Miles of jungle so dense, all who enter are never found. We must not rest.
Lloyd:::Okay. Let's get lost.
Stranger::: Attacking the ninja was merely a ploy to scare them into sending a warning message to the Chosen One. I intercepted their SOS and now we know where the Golden Ninja is. The Falcon is now our beacon. He will lead us right to him.
Overlord::: Ha ha ha! Whoever you are, I like you. Soon the power will be mine!
