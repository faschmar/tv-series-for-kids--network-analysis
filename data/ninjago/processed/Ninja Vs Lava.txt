Jay::: That Clutch Powers guy might have run off to save himself, stranding us here, but I have to admit: his book is pretty good!It has a section for everything. Even, what to when "all is lost."He recommends vocal exercises, like: "Brobrogoo-goo!".Brobrogoo-goo!
Lloyd::: How is saying a bunch of nonsense possibly going to help us?
Jay::: It says that it keeps you calm by "relaxing your face."Brobrogoo-goo! Brobrogoo-goo! Brobrogoo-goo! Brobrogoo-goo!
Zane:::Perhaps Clutch didn't abandon us. Perhaps he went to seek help.
Zane::: I find that highly unlikely.
Nya::: We need to update your sarcasm circuits, Zane. If we get out of here.
Cole::: We wouldn't even be hanging here if Jay hadn't opened that crypt!
Jay::: Me?! Zane's the one that didn't warn us in time!Brobrogoo-goo.
Lloyd::: How can you blame Zane?! Who opens a possibly cursed tomb without checking it out first?!
Jay:::Opening a tomb is how you check it out!And what about Kai, hmm?He's the one who let Aspheera steal his power!
Nya::: Hey! Watch it!
Lloyd::: She's right. How's he doing, Zane?
Zane:::His vitals are stable. He should recover shortly.
Lloyd::: Good. Now we just have to figure a way out of here. Any ideas?
Jay:::Maybe there's something in Clutch's book! He's got a chapter entitled "Escaping from Close Calls."
Cole::: Really? What does it say?
Jay::: Uh. Let me check.Aw, great! Now I can't even see!Oh. That's better!
Nya::: Uh, Jay? Not better! 
Jay:::Incoming lava! DON'T PANIC! Clutch has a whole chapter on rising lava. I just have to turn to that page. WAH!Gah! Oh, that book was our only hope!
Lloyd:::Everyone! We need to get out of this room.Follow my lead!
Jay::: Yeeaa-aah!Oh, thank you Nya! I love you!
Nya::: Just! Hold! On!
Ninja::: 
Lloyd::: Nice work, Nya. Now let's get out of here and save Ninjago City from Aspheera. What do you say, ninja?
Ninja::: Yeah!Aw! Ow!
Lloyd:::That's how we came in. How about we all go that way together. 
Lloyd::: All right, Cole. Do your thing.
Jay::: Cole! You could've smashed Kai!
Cole::: Me?! You yanked me out!
Lloyd::: Guys! We need to stop fighting and work together!Look, it's time we faced it. Master Wu's right. We've gone soft. Not just individually, but as a team. We have to put aside our differences and—
Cole::: Uh, Lloyd?
Lloyd::: No, let me finish. We work together or Ninjago will fall for—
Zane:::Lava!
Lloyd::: No, not lava! I was talking about Aspheera!
Nya::: No! Lava! Right there!Right now!
Lloyd:::Ahh!
Cole::: Oh, man. I hope Kai's not gonna remember any of this.
Lloyd::: Woah! A serpent mummy...
Jay::: That's two things I don't like in one!
Cole::: I don't think you have to worry. Ancient dried up snakes aren't much of a threat.
Jay::: No, but that is!
Nya::: You know, I'm starting to think this isn't your ordinary garden variety lava.
Jay::: W-What gave you that idea?
Lloyd::: Uh, aren't mummies supposed to be slow?
Jay::: Don't worry. I'll just open up a can of Spinjitzu on their bandaged butts! Ninja-Go!
Lloyd::: Wait!
Cole::: No! No! No! No!
Nya::: Ah!
Zane::: Woah!
Jay::: Okay, I'm willing to admit that was a terrible idea!
Lloyd::: Come on! Let's get out of here!
Cole::: Ha! That should slow them down.
Jay::: Ah!
Cole::: Relax! That's just Hageman.
Jay::: You say that like I should be totally cool running into a long deceased explorer!
Nya:::A long deceased explorer has a backpack full of gear we need to make it up to that passageway!
Ninja:::Woahoh! 
Nya:::Did anyone know that Kai was this heavy? What did he eat for dinner last night, a cinder block?!
Cole::: Seriously, I am DONE with cake jokes from Kai after this.No more cake jo—o-woah! 
Jay:::Brobrogoo-goo!
Lloyd::: Nya!
Zane::: Nya!
Nya::: I'm okay! But I can't move! Or I'll lose my grip!
Zane::: Nobody move! 
Jay::: Oh yeah! This thing! Come on! We're home free!Ah-ah! Pull me up! Pull me up! Pull me up!
Lloyd:::I gotcha!
Nya::: Maybe that was just a bad step?
Jay::: Brobrogoo-goo!
Lloyd::: Will you stop that?! It doesn't help!
Jay::: You haven't even tried it!
Lloyd::: We need a plan!
Cole::: Like what, Lloyd? What kind of plan could possibly help us get out of this mess? There's no bridge!
Lloyd::: Then we make one!
Zane::: Make what?
Lloyd::: We become the bridge! We link our arms and hands and we make a bridge!
Jay::: A ninja bridge!
Cole::: You see? You say that like it's a thing. That's not a thing!
Lloyd::: We're going to make it a thing! Look, we all know we haven't been working together the way we used to, but Ninjago is relying on us. We're the only chance they have. And if we can't bridge our differences and work together, then there is no hope.
Cole::: I'm not usually big on crazy plans, but we don't have much choice.
Nya::: He's right. Let's do it.
Lloyd::: Okay, on three, topple. One. Two. Three!
Nya::: Okay, Jay. On three, let—
Jay::: Ow! Uh!Why is it always me?!Ahh!
Cole::: Ha! It worked! "Ninja bridge!" It's officially a thing! It's a thing!
Nya::: Ugh. I never want to see another pyramid in my life!Oh no.
Cole::: What do we do?
Lloyd::: I..I'm sorry. I failed us.
Zane::: No. We failed each other.
Jay::: Aw, he's right. We're all to blame.
Cole::: Especially Kai. He didn't help at all.
Jay::: Brobrogoo-goo. Brobrogoo-goo.
Zane::: Brobrogoo-goo.
Ninja::: Brobrogoo-goo. Brobrogoo-goo. Brobrogoo-goo.
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L.!
Nya::: Glad to see you!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Hold on.
Lloyd::: Thank you, P.I.X.A.L. We would've literally been toast without you.
Zane::: How did you find us?
P.I.X.A.L.::: The paperboy told us where you were.
Nya::: Paperboy?
P.I.X.A.L.::: It's a long story. Come on. Let's get those chains off you.There is no time to waste. A Serpentine witch has raised an army and is laying siege to Ninjago City.
Lloyd::: This is bad.
Kai:::Ugh. Where am I? What happened?
Jay::: Kai, buddy!
Nya::: You're awake!
Lloyd::: Long story short: the Serpentine witch that stole your powers is attacking Ninjago City. We've got to stop her! Fast!
Kai::: Uh. Okay, but-ugh!Why does my face hurt so much?
Lloyd:::Here's the important thing: we're free again and ready for round two. Aspheera has no idea what she's in for now. Ninja, go!
