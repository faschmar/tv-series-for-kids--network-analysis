Police Commissioner::: Halt!As police commissioner of Ninjago City, I hereby inform you, you are in violation of city codes 54-1 "Wanting destruction."And 63-6 "Open flames in public." You are under arrest!Okay, that's it!Let 'em have it, boys!Oh, great.Uh-uh.. It's the ninja! 
Cole::: Hang on guys!
Lloyd::: How about a fair fight?
Cole::: I got this one!Ah!
Lloyd:::Nya!Can you get us some Water?
Nya::: I'll try!He-yah! 
Kai::: Pick on someone your own size!Oh, right. No powers! 
Police Commissioner::: Oh, thank you! It's good to have you all back!
Lloyd::: Good to be back, Commissioner!
Commissioner:::We're getting reports, the leader of the serpents is heading for the Ninjago History Museum!
Cole::: Her name's Aspheera. And she's deeply nuts.
Lloyd::: Whatever she's after, you better not let her get it.
Commissioner::: How can we help?
Lloyd::: Evacuate as many people as you can and set up a perimeter. We'll handle the rest.
Commissioner:::You heard him! 
Lloyd::: We better get a move on!
Kai::: Actually...I'm sitting this one out.
Ninja::: What?!
Kai::: Aspheera stole my powers, remember? I can't help! I mean, Jay had to save me just now. Jay!
Jay::: Huh. That's a weird way of saying thanks.
Kai::: Just go without me. I'll only get in your way.
Lloyd::: Powers don't make a hero.
Kai:::Dude, that's just something that people with powers say to make people without powers feel better.
Lloyd::: That's not true! We need you.
Nya::: We don't have time to argue! The people in that museum need help!
Cole::: She's right! We gotta go!
Lloyd::: If you change your mind, you'll know where we'll be.
Kai::: Ah! Where'd you come from?
Jake::: I saw you and came to get your autograph. Can you make it out to Jake, your biggest fan? You guys probably just saved my home and every other building here!
Kai:::The other ninja did that, kid.
Jake::: Why didn't you go with them?
Kai::: My powers...aren't so powerful..anymore.
Jake::: So what? You can't just quit! Ninja never quit.
Kai::: I'm not quitting!
Jake::: You're quitting.
Kai:::It's complicated, kid.
Kai::: Oh, quit it with the eyes, will ya?Hey, Jake! Where you going?
Jake::: If you won't help the ninja, I will!
Kai:::Oh, great! 
Security Guard #1::: Oh man, the whole city's going crazy out there.
Security Guard #2::: I heard on the news, all these snakes are taking orders from some Serpentine sorceress.
Security Guard #1:::Well, good thing we're safe and sound in here.
Security guards::: Ah-ah! Uh!
Aspheera::: I seek this! 
Security Guard #1::: Th-Th-Th-Th-That's the Serpentine exhibit. Hall D! Ah!
Tour Guide::: And here we have the finest ancient scroll collection in all of Ninjago.Gah!Children, this way, this way, this way!
Aspheera:::No. Lame. Fake! Where is it?! 
Gayle Gossip:::I think this is good news.
Vinny::: I dunno, she looks pretty ticked off.
Gayle::: Exactly.
Aspheera:::Yah!Ah! 
Serpentine::: Oh-Oh, my. I must have been out for a while. Aspheera! Your eternal greatness! It is I, Char!
Aspheera::: Who?
Char::: Your humble servant.I have served you fiercely and loyally, carrying out your every whim. Your every command!
Aspheera:::Yes, of course. Char.
Char::: Th-Thank you, mistress, for bringing me back. I'm deeply, deeply touched that you should come here for me.
Aspheera::: I'm here for this!Not you.
Char::: Ah!
Aspheera::: If you wish to serve me, find me that scroll!
Char:::Your wish is my command.
Lloyd::: They're looking for a scroll. Must have some special kind of power, but they haven't found it yet.
Nya::: Maybe it's in another exhibit.Hall H!
Lloyd::: Come on. If we hurry, we can beat them.There! Look!This has to be it!
Jay::: Great! Kai, melt the glass!Oh...yeah.
Cole::: It wouldn't work anyway. It's probably clearstone. Maybe if I caused a centralized earthquake...Or we could do that.
Nya::: Lloyd! 
Cole::: Are you okay?!
Zane::: What happened?
Lloyd::: I...I don't know. It was like suddenly I felt this... this wave of energy pass through me.
Jay::: Your head was on fire!
Aspheera::: Ah! You...impossible! I left you entombed!
Cole::: Yeah? Well, we got out!
Char::: Your highness! The Forbidden Scroll!
Aspheera:::Attack!
Lloyd::: Don't let her get the scroll!
Aspheera::: That's mine!Ah!
Vinny::: Uh, G-Gayle.We should get out of here.
Gayle::: I want to see this.
Vinny::: Gayle, come on! 
Aspheera::: Ha!
Lloyd::: Gah!
Lloyd::: Ah! Gah!
Aspheera::: Yes. At last!The power of the Forbidden Scroll is mine.Mine!
Lloyd::: Not if we have anything to say about it!
Nya::: Oh no!
Lloyd::: Ninja-Go!
Lloyd::: No!
Aspheera:::My loyal servants, rise and obey. You three, finish the ninja. The rest of you, follow me.
Jake::: I won't let you hurt them. 
Kai:::Now, Zane. Let 'em have it! 
Jake::: You...you saved the day. Even without powers.
Kai::: Yeah, well, I made a new friend who reminded me ninja never quit.
Jake::: You mean...me?
Kai::: Yeah, Jake. I mean you. 
Zane::: Are you okay?
Lloyd::: Yeah, I'm fine.
Zane::: What happened back there? What did that scroll do to you?
Lloyd::: I don't know. Whatever it was, when I touched it, I felt...I felt...
Zane::: What?
Lloyd::: Power.
Aspheera:::Revenge!
Lloyd::: Like nothing I've ever felt. We have to get it back, Zane. Before it's too late.
