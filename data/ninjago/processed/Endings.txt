Faith::: The darkness came upon us in the middle of the day. An unnatural darkness that filled us with fear.We tried to fight them with the help of our dragons.But in the end, darkness prevailed.One by one, we fell, until I was the last.I saw that we could not defeat it, so I fled.I came to warn you. 
Wu::: It was wise to flee.
Faith::: Hmph. Was it? Now I wonder, could I have fought harder? Could I have done something?
Misako::: If you had stayed, you would have fallen into darkness, just like the others.
Faith::: But what if I had led them here?
Wu::: Do not think such thoughts. The evil that has come here has only itself to blame. 
Monks:::The ninja! They're back! The ninja are home! Haha! The ninja are here.
Wu::: Let us see what news the ninja have brought.
Wu::: What is it? 
Nya::: It's Cole. He—He...
Jay::: He's gone.
Kai::: He fell into the darkness.
Wu:::A-And the Realm Crystal?
Lloyd::: We destroyed it, but it didn't stop them.
Misako::: What do we do now?
Garmadon:::Luckily, you have me.
Misako::: Garmadon?
Garmadon::: Misako. The old me would have something heartfelt and sweet. But, I am no longer that man.Wu, wipe that gloomy look off your face and do something with this. 
Wu:::The Armor of the Golden Master.
Nya::: If we melt it down and reforge the weapons of Spinjitzu, we might still have a chance.
Wu::: Prepare the forge.
Kai:::I guess I better get to it, huh?
Nya::: Kai, you're the Master of Fire. You can do this.
Kai::: Yeah. Right. How hard can it be? 
Wu:::Cole. 
Kai:::Let's do this.The Sword of Fire.
Wu:::Hmm.
Kai::: The Nunchucks of Lightning. 
Jay:::Yeah!
Kai::: Shurikens of Ice. 
Zane::: Cool! 
Kai:::And the Scythe...The Scythe of Quakes. 
Nya::: That was Cole's.
Kai::: I think he'd want you to have it. 
Nya::: The darkness. 
Lloyd::: It's here.
Cole:::Uh. Ah! Ahh! Wh-wh-where the heck am I?Oh, oh, boy-boy.H-hey, guys? Did you forget something? It's me, Cole! Guys? Hello?!Oh, great. Now, what? Stay calm. Don't panic. Why panic? I mean, I'm all alone, surrounded by creepy, black tendrils that are getting closer and closer. Huh?Yah!Phew.Let's see if we can get this working again.Hahaha!Oh, come on. I'm not a microtronics guy.Where's Nya, or P.I.X.A.L., or Zane, or Jay when you need them? Please work, please work, please work, please work.Please work.Where is it? Where? I can't see it. I can't see anything.It worked! Whoo-hoo-hoohoo! I can make it. Yeah, right. As soon as you step out there, it's gonna freeze you solid. Quit talking like that! I'm going for it. Huh.Ninja, GOO—Mmph. I can do that.Let's... n-never... do that... a-again.Whoo-hoo-hoohoo!Whoa!Okay. You asked for it! 
The Omega::: So, begins the end.
Misako:::Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Mother! You should be inside.
Misako::: I'm not leaving you.
Lloyd:::No matter what happens, those inside need your protection. Will you do that for me?
Misako:::I love you. Be careful. 
Kai::: 
Jay::: Faith!
Kai::: You should be resting, Faith. You're not fully healed yet.
Faith:::If the end is coming, I will face it on my feet.
Wu:::As will I. 
Garmadon::: Hm. I did not expect to fight alongside you again.
Wu::: Nor I you. It seems life has a few surprises left for both of us.Close the doors!Quickly!
The Omega::: The time of endings has come.
Lloyd::: This is it, guys. Pick your targets.
Garmadon::: I'll take the big one.
Jay::: He's all yours.
Garmadon:::mm-Yargh!
Jay::: Whoo-ha! 
Kai:::Dah! Heh-unh.
Zane:::Heh-unh! 
Garmadon:::Hehh-arh!Hehh-augh!Mm-yah!
Kai::: Nya, look out!
Nya::: Ah! 
Lloyd::: Unh!Euh! Use the scythe!
Nya:::I'm trying, but I'm not the Master of Earth! It's not responding. Oh— 
Lloyd:::Eunh! There are too many! 
Nya:::Unh. 
Cole:::Hey, guys! Couldn't wait for me, huh?
Nya:::Cole!
Lloyd::: How—where—
Jay::: Th-Th-Th—we thought we'd lost you—y-you, jerk!
Cole::: You can't get rid of me that easily.Is that my old scythe?
Nya::: Yes. And you can have it back. 
Cole:::Huhh!Ha!
Kai:::Whoo-hoo! Dah!
Nya, Lloyd, and Wu::: Yah!! 
Garmadon:::hehh-yAh!
The Omega:::You only delay the inevitable. We cannot be defeated. 
Garmadon::: This grows tiresome. I think it's time we evened things out a bit. Rrargh!Rr-Yah!Hmm. Now, that I have my own stick, let's try this again. 
Jay:::They just keep coming!
Garmadon::: Hmm. Ah! 
Zane::: The weapons! They are not enough!
Kai::: We can't hold them much longer!
The Omega::: You are Oni.But only in form. In your heart, I sense uncertainty and doubt.Part of you longs to understand these pitiful beings.To be one of them. Your hopes weaken you. 
Lloyd::: Father!Dah-Arhh!Fall back! Everyone, fall back! 
Nya:::Copy that!
Lloyd::: Cole, help me!
Cole:::Huh-ah!That's not gonna last forever.
Jay::: Forever. Forever.Nya.I have to ask you something important.
Nya::: What? Now? 
Jay:::Yes, now.Nya, you make me so happy everyday.When we're not together, I miss you so much that it feels like part of me is missing.Will you be my Yang?
Nya::: 
Cole:::Now you're asking?!
Kai:::We seriously need to talk about your sense of timing, Jay!
Jay::: There may not be another time.
Nya:::Yes!Of course! Yes, yes, yes! Oh!
Kai:::I taught him how to do that.
Cole::: Nya, Jay, it's been fun, guys.
Zane::: It has been an honor.
Jay::: Let's go out with a bang.
Kai::: Yeah. Let's give 'em—
Lloyd:::A tornado!
Kai::: Yeah! Let's give 'em a tornado!Uh—wait, what?
Lloyd::: What's the opposite of destruction? Creation!Don't you get it? Creation—the Tornado of Creation! It's the one thing that can defeat the Oni—the power of Creation! But all of us this time, or it won't work.
Jay::: How do you know?
Kai::: Yeah. It was a miracle it worked the first time!
Lloyd::: Okay, I'm guessing. But what do we have to lose?
Zane::: He's right. We have nothing to lose.
Cole::: What the heck. I'm in.
Kai::: I love crazy ideas. Let's do it!
Jay:::We're one now, Nya. Care to join? 
Lloyd::: It has to be all of us.
Garmadon::: I am not one of you.
Lloyd::: No, but you're as much a part of the history of Ninjago as the rest of us. 
Cole::: Here goes nothing! Ninja, GOO!! 
Kai, Jay, Zane, Nya, Lloyd, Wu::: Ninja, GOO!! 
The First Spinjitzu Master::: Hello, Lloyd.Do you like my dragon?
Lloyd::: You.You're the First Spinjitzu Master.
The First Spinjitzu Master::: No, no, please—no kneeling.You have done so much for Ninjago. If anyone should kneel, it should be I.
Lloyd::: What is this place? What happened?
The First Spinjitzu Master::: You faced destruction with dignity and courage, and you responded with creation and love.There is no greater response.
Lloyd::: But... why am I here?
The First Spinjitzu Master::: I brought you here to say thank you for all you have done.
Lloyd::: But...
The First Spinjitzu Master::: Yes?
Lloyd::: I don't understand.
The First Spinjitzu Master::: Life is balance. Endings are never really endings, only new beginnings.And you have given us all a new beginning.The future is what we make of it, and you refused to let our future end in darkness.Well done, Lloyd Montgomery Garmadon. Well done. 
Lloyd::: Thanks, but—well, I don't really understand any of this.
The First Spinjitzu Master::: You will soon... if you choose to come with me. 
Lloyd::: Come with you... where?
The First Spinjitzu Master::: That is a secret. But you will be happy there. Or you can return to your friends and take up your duties as the Green Ninja again.
Lloyd::: And if I go home, will I remember this? 
The First Spinjitzu Master::: You will think it was a dream. In time, you will forget all about it. 
Jay::: Ow.We're alive.We're alive!
Cole:::Eh. Kai! 
Zane::: Where is Lloyd? 
Kai::: Huh?
Zane::: Oh, no.Lloyd!
Kai::: Lloyd. Buddy, wake up.
Nya::: He—He's not moving!
Cole::: Someone find Wu. Where's Wu?! 
Jay::: You can do something, right? Right?!
Wu::: There is nothing to be done.
Nya::: Oh, Lloyd.
Garmadon::: Hmm. 
Lloyd::: Where am I?
Nya::: Don't you remember?
Kai::: Yeah. You had us worried there for a sec.
Lloyd::: But... the First Spinjitzu Master...
Cole::: You must have hit your head pretty hard, buddy.
Jay::: Yeah, let's get you inside, huh? 
Wu:::Goodbye, Brother.
