Kai::: What's going on... 
Nya::: The Fire Temple? Boy, are you feeling homesick, Flame?
Kai::: Maybe he forgot his toothbrush.
Nya::: Awesome!
Kai::: Flame, why did you bring us back here?
Nya::: I think he wants to show you something.
Kai:::Okay, okay. I'm going.
Kai::: Ahh... so that's what you wanted to show us... a secret entrance to the Underworld. 
Krazi:::Uh...Wyplash, boss. We got company.
Wyplash::: Huh? Ninja?! Attack!
Kai:::Ninja, Go! 
Wyplash::: Not so strong without the three amigos backing you up, are you?!
Nya::: Hold on, Kai! We're coming to help! 
Kai::: I can handle it.
Nya::: No you can't, stupid.
Kai::: I'm formulating a plan here.
Nya::: Yep! I don't think their boney butts will be bothering us for a while.
Kai::: See? I told you I'd think of something.
Nya::: Huh.
Kruncha::: You dummy!You left the stove on again, didn't you?!
Nuckal::: No, you did!
