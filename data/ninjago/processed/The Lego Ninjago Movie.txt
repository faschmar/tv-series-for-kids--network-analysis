Kid 1:::See you later!
Kid 2::: Come on, guys, leave him alone.
Boy::: Hello?
Mr. Liu:::Boy...
Boy::: Wow... That was amazing.
Mr. Liu::: Why don't you play outside with your friends?
Boy::: I don’t know.
Mr. Liu::: Come here. You don't know, Huh?
Boy::: Sometimes they make fun of me.
Mr. Liu::: Hmm.
Boy::: Is that real?
Mr. Liu::: Yes, it's real. Everything here is real.
Boy::: Whoa. Is that real?
Mr. Liu::: That cat is real. Real monster.
Mr. Liu::: What's that?
Boy::: This? This is Lloyd.
Mr. Liu::: Hmm. He looks like a very brave fighter.
Boy::: No, he's just a kid. He can't do anything.
Mr. Liu::: He might look different...
Mr. Liu::: ...but he can do great things.
Boy::: Whoa...
Mr. Liu::: You just have to look at it from a different point of view.
Mr. Liu::: Ah, duì bù qǐ. 
Boy::: Whoa...
Mr. Liu::: This is his teacher. Very old. Very wise. And very handsome.
Mr. Liu::: Have you ever heard the legend behind the legend of Ninjago?
Boy::: No.
Mr. Liu::: I would tell you, but to truly see you must forget everything, you know... and see things in a new way. The story of Ninjago... is the story of a boy. His name is Lloyd, and his dad is the worst guy in the history of the world.

Robin::: Well, looks like everyone is on pins and needles waiting for Garmadon's next attack.
Voice-over 2::: ATTACK FORECAST!
Michael::: Our experts predict a 95% chance of a Garmadon attack today.
Robin::: Yikes! Ninjago, you better stay inside.
Michael::: You better stay right there! Don't you dare come out! At least until our Secret Ninja Force get in.
Robin::: Thank goodness for those ninjas.
Michael::: But who are these secret ninjas, Robin?
Robin::: We have so many questions.
Voice-over 2::: BURNING QUESTIONS!
Voice-over 1::: Fire Ninja. Where is he on a scale of one to awesome?
Kai::: I'm not gonna lie. Um... AWESOME!
Voice-over 1::: Earth Ninja. When will he upgrade to digital?
Cole::: No, I would never do that.
Voice-over 1::: Ice Ninja. Is he a real boy, or a robot?
Zane::: How dare you? I'm a wild teen.
Voice-over 1::: Lightning Ninja. Is he the bravest ninja of them all?
Jay::: 
Voice-over 1::: I'll take that as a yes. Water Ninja. She's a girl and a ninja. Can she really have it all?
Nya::: You fellas need to inform yourselves... of where we're at culturally.
Voice-over 1::: And finally the Green Ninja. He fights in the air, on the ground and in the kitchen, with a refrigerator. But what is he hiding, and who is he really?
Voice-over 2::: LOCAL BIRTHDAYS!
Robin::: Celebrating birthdays today are this hot dog guy, this panda and... uh oh. Lloyd Garmadon!
Michael::: The son of the evil Lord Garmadon.
Robin::: Must be tough to be that kid.

Lloyd::: Hello?
Garmadon::: Hello? What do you want?
Lloyd::: Uh... you called me.
Garmadon::: Hang on a second. Let me- Hm. Must've butt-dialled you. Who is this?
Lloyd:::It's Lloyd. Lloyd Garmadon, your son?
Garmadon::: No. my son is totally bald and has no teeth.
Lloyd::: Yeah, well, surprise. I'm not a baby anymore.
Garmadon::: Duly noted. How old are you? You're seven, right, you're seven?
Lloyd::: Sixteen.
Garmadon::: Huh.
Lloyd:::Just add nine to that...
Garmadon::: Well, good talk son.
Lloyd::: Wait, are you sure there, there isn't a special reason why you might've called me today, on this day, specifically, todaaaaay?
Garmadon::: Look, I didn't call you, my butt called you.
Lloyd::: ...Oh.
Garmadon::: Well, no time to chat. Sorry, Dad has gotta go to work. I've got to get that Green Ninja.
Lloyd::: Yeah.
Garmadon::: Glad the teeth finally came in. Buh-bye!
Koko::: Lloooyd! Good mooorniiiing!
Lloyd::: Mom, hey. Um, here's a thought. What if I... didn't... go to school today?
Koko::: What? Oh, no, you don't want to miss school, honey. These are the best years of your life!
Lloyd::: Um, have you, have you been... to high school? ‘Cus uh. It's judgy. Pretty judgy.
Koko::: Oh, honey. You just need to give them a chance to see the real you.
Lloyd::: Yeah. I don't think I can actually show people the real... me.
Koko::: That's not true. All you've got to do is to show them the person you are on the inside.
Koko::: Right here, where it matters most. Oh! And also, don't forget: if your dad attacks the city again today, just be sure to-
Both::: Duck and cover until the secret ninjas give the all-clear.
Koko::: Oh, and also don't forget...
Lloyd::: Yeah? 
Koko::: Have a happy birthday, honey.
Lloyd::: Thanks mom. I’ll try my best.
Koko::: Of course you will!
Lloyd::: Hello!
Lloyd::: Hey...
Lloyd::: Cool...
Girl::: That’s the kid I was telling you about. His dad ruins everything.
Zane::: Hello, fellow teenager.
Lloyd::: Zane, hey.
Zane::: Man, my mom is on my case all the time. She's all, "", and I'm like, "Lay off, mom. I'm just a teenager."
Lloyd::: I hear that.
Kai::: BRO! Dude, give me a hug, man. Give me a birthday hug!
Lloyd::: That's a good one.
Zane::: Birthday hug? Let me get in on that.
Lloyd:::Zane-
Zane::: I’ll increase the pressure dramatically.
Lloyd::: Zane! Zane- Zane!
Nya::: Oh-ho-ho, Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Nya.
Nya::: Yo bro.
Kai::: What's up, sis?
Nya::: Oh, hey, actual bro.
Jay::: Hey, Nya! Where'd you get that bike? At the... great stuff store? Uh.
Nya::: Guys. Check out my new paint job. ‘Cus I did it myself! The Lady Iron... Dragon. My hero!
Chad::: Hey everyone, look. It's Garma-dork and the dork squad. You want to hear our new cheer?
Cheerleaders::: L-L-O-Y-D! His dad is bad and so is he! Boo Lloyd! Boo Lloyd!
Chad::: BOO LLOYD!
Lloyd:::Great chant! I'll bet you got a number one hit on your hands!
Radio::: And straight in at number one with a bullet, it’s “Boo Lloyd”! L-L-O-Y-D! His dad is bad and so is he! Boo Lloyd! Boo Lloyd! Boooooooooo!
Garmadon::: Citizens of Ninjago! Get ready to welcome your new overlord! Who goes by the name of...?
Citizen 1::: Garmadon!
Garmadon::: What’s my name?
Citizen 2::: Garmadon!
Garmadon::: Say it again?
Citizen 2::: Garmadon!
Garmadon::: I can't hear you!
Citizen 3::: Garmadon!
Baby::: Garmadon!
Garmadon::: Don't wear it out. Okay. General number six!

General #6::: I can do that!
Garmadon::: General number one! Take the TV station!
General #1::: 10-4!
Michael::: What?!
Garmadon::: General number five! Crash the stock market!
General #5::: Okie-do!
Garmadon::: General number three, knock over that table. General number two! Pop that kid's balloon. General number four! Make the school bus dangle precariously over an overpass or something. I've never seen that before.
Garmadon::: Now all I have to do is climb to the top of Ninjago Tower, and then I will rule over Ninjago.
Mayor::: Wait, What?!
Garmadon::: I said: "I will rule over Ninjago." Forever! 
Bus kid::: Where are the ninjas?
Ms. Laudita::: Uh oh! It’s Garmadon!
Students::: Thanks, Lloyd.
Ms. Laudita::: You know what to do! Duck and cover!
Ninja::: Can I have a bathroom pass?
Ms. Laudita::: I think you mean: “May I”. “May I have a bathroom pass?” You know, do whatever you want.
Kai::: Come on, come on!
Ninja::: Ninjaaaa GO!
Computer::: Ninja Computer System initiated.
Nya::: Come on!
Kai::: Alright! Let’s go!
Lloyd::: Ninja team! Shout out your call sign. Ha ha! Kai, light it up!
Kai::: Fire Mech! So ninja.
Computer::: Fire Mech ignited.
Kai::: Alright, take it away, sis!
Nya::: Water Mech! Ready and standing by. Zane!
Kai::: Come on!
Lloyd::: Your turn, buddy!
Zane::: Ice Mech! Loading, loading, loading, loading.
Lloyd::: Ready, Jay?
Jay::: Yeah, yeah, I got this. Lightning Mech, ready! Wait, no, not ready. Ready!
Nya::: Cole, do you want to get Garmadon’s butt?
Cole::: Earth Mech!
Computer::: Turntables at thirty three and a third RPM.
Cole::: Ready and standing by.
Lloyd::: Green Ninja! Ready and standing by. All ninjas! Hit it!
Lloyd::: Alright, ninjas, follow me!
Jay::: As long as we have these mechs, we’re unstoppable!
Zane::: If we were The Beatles, you would be John, you would be Paul, you would be George, and I would be their computer!
Citizen 4::: We love you Green Ninja!
Lloyd::: Jay, you take the air.
Jay::: 10-4, good buddy!
Lloyd::: Nya, water.
Nya::: It’s a dangerous and fascinating environment.
Lloyd::: I know, right? Kai, Zane and Cole? You guys take downtown!
Kai::: Already here, dude! We’re taking some heavy fire!
Cole::: Hold on, Kai. I got you covered. You heard my latest track? It’s a SMASH!
Kai::: Thanks, Cole!
Lloyd::: Jay, you’ve got bogies on your six!
Computer::: You’ve also got them on your three, one, seven, five, six, eight, nine and two.
Jay::: Aaargh!
Soldier::: I’ve got good ?) Fire! Too close for missiles! Switching to crabs!
Jay::: Aaaaaaargh!
Soldier::: Get your affairs in order, Lightning Ninja!
Jay::: Aaargh! I’ve gotta charge up my super-sonic dynamo! Come on, charge! Charge! Hurry up, charge charge charge charge charge charge! Clear!
Kai::: Zane! You are the man!
Zane::: Yes, I'm a normal human teenager.
Lloyd::: Nice work, guys! I’m going after Garmadon.
Bus kid 2::: Somebody help us!
Lloyd::: Classmates. Hold on!
Lloyd::: Oh no.
Bus kid 3::: Thank you, Green Ninja!
Bus kid 4::: You’re our hero!
Bus kid 5::: I wanna be him when I grow up!
Kai::: Hey, Lloyd, your dad- I mean, uh- Garmadon’s almost at the Mayor’s office!
Lloyd::: I'm on it. We’ve got you surrounded, Garmadon.
Garmadon::: You’re too slow, Green Ninja. You can't catch me. Where am I? Am I over here? Or am I over there?
Lloyd::: You are right behind that building. I can see your shark tail sticking out.
Garmadon::: Oh. Let me uh- there. Where's Garmadon now?Am I over here, here, here? Or am I over there, there, there? It’s like a house of mirrors in here.
Lloyd::: Do you think you're hiding right now? Do you actually think I can't see you?
Garmadon::: Well, if you can see me, why don't you shoot me?
Garmadon::: Ow! That was like in my kidney!
Lloyd::: Why do you want to conquer Ninjago so badly?
Garmadon::: Because there's something very, very special here.
Lloyd::: What?
Garmadon::: I'm going to let the walls down for just a second, Green Ninja.
Lloyd::: Go- go on.
Garmadon::: About sixteen years ago, I lost something I should have never given up.
Lloyd::: What, what- what is it? You can say it. It's okay, you can say it.
Garmadon::: I had this guitar, in college, and I traded it stupidly for like, a jacket or something.
Lloyd::: That's what you were referring to? That-
Garmadon::: Yeah! What else would I be referring to?
Lloyd::: I don't know! Maybe something else! Think about it!
Garmadon::: What? No!
Lloyd::: Are you sure there's not any other sort of connection you have to the city? Nothing?
Garmadon::: There is someone in the city I love very much.
Lloyd::: Yeah?
Garmadon::: Yeah. I remember when I first laid eyes on him.
Lloyd::: Go on.
Garmadon::: The last time I saw him was, well, I guess about sixteen years ago too.
Lloyd::: Yeah?
Garmadon::: I was just a... irresponsible kid and I...
Lloyd::: Uh huh?
Garmadon::: It was this... guy who made probably the best sushi I've ever had in my life. You never knew what was coming next, and you didn't even order! It was one of those places where you don't even get a menu.
Lloyd::: Omakase?
Garmadon::: Is that the name of the place?
Lloyd::: No, that just means-
Garmadon:::That is! That’s the name of the place!
Lloyd::: -he brings it to you, and you don't choose, he chooses-
Garmadon:::That’s the place!
Lloyd::: Omakase. Anyway. Just to clarify, nothing- nothing else. If you really racked your brain, there's no other connection.
Garmadon::: Yes. There was a boy that I had in my life.
Lloyd::: Um. What- what happened to your child?
Garmadon::: He was bald, had no teeth, couldn't chew, always crying. Couldn't walk! Couldn't even walk! I mean, I was like, what are we going to do with this kid? So I'm like, I don't want a hairless-
Lloyd:::Shu- shush! Shush! Sh- Shu- Zip it! Zip! Done! Stop! Stop! Stop talking! You’re done!
Garmadon::: -crying son for the rest of my life. And that was when I made the decision to go away and live my life!
Lloyd::: Aargh!
Computer::: Mega missile mode. Right claw missile. Left claw missile. ?) Tongue rocket. Spine missile, one, two, three, four. Tail rocket, one, two. Eye missile. Other eye missile. Toe missile. Wrist rocket. Head missile. Other head missile. Backup head missile. ?) Butt torpedoes.
Shark soldier::: Oh! Phew. Just one day ‘til retirement-
Garmadon:::Jeez, where'd that come from?Did not see that coming.Your missiles are very accurate, Green Ninja! Too bad for you, I upgraded all of my shields!...That's all I seem to have at the moment, just my favourite shields. 
Lloyd::: Face it, Garmadon! You will never take over Ninjago. So why don't you just give up and go away for good?
Garmadon::: Well, anything's open for discussion. Oh yeah. Except that! shields down! Here, catch! Shields up!
Garmadon:::Did you see that?
Garmadon::: I mean, who taught you how to catch, man?
Soldier::: Nice catch, loser!
Lloyd::: Oh yeah? Well, take this!
Garmadon::: Amazing! Who taught you how to throw?
Lloyd::: Funny you ask, um, no one. Because I, uh, I never had a dad to play catch with me.
Garmadon::: Well, it shows, because that was the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life.
Lloyd::: Or, uh, you know, teach me how to ride a bike, or shave, or-
Lloyd::: -or how to diffuse a bomb!
Garmadon::: You know what's funny? That I know how to do all those things.
Lloyd::: Do you?
Garmadon::: Yeah.
Lloyd::: Oh, good to know.
Garmadon::: And they're just sitting there idle in my brain, just wasted, floating away. Never taught them to anybody.
Lloyd::: Mhm.
Garmadon::: And they'll probably die with me.
Lloyd::: Really.
Garmadon::: When I die.
Lloyd::: Aaaargh!
Garmadon::: If I die. Which will never happen.
Lloyd:::Just- just leave Ninjago already, please-
Garmadon::: I will never die.
Lloyd::: -and get out of my life!
Garmadon::: Ever never ever. Huh- wh- Get out of your life?Weirdly kind of personal, isn't it?
Kai::: Uh oh.
Jay::: Oh, man.
Lloyd::: Um. Uh- ah- No?
Garmadon::: You got a lot of issues, Green Ninja. I hope you get the chance to work them all out by the time I’m back. And when I return, I'll have something really wicked in store for you, something big!
Citizen 1::: Uh, did he just say he's coming back?
Citizen 2::: Can't those ninjas get rid of him for good?
Citizen 3::: Oh, great. Now I have to rebuild my Pilates studio.
Citizen 4:::That stinks.
Citizen 5:::I don’t know how, but I bet that Lloyd Garmadon had something to do with this.
Citizen 6:::You can say that again.
Citizen 5:::I don’t know how-
Garmadon::: Is that Green Ninja still staring at me?
Soldier::: Yes, sir.
Garmadon::: Ugh. What a weirdo.
Soldier::: Volcano base, this is Alpha Squad, arriving shortly at LB.
Soldier 2::: Bakery team, the victory cake goes back in the fridge. The victory cake goes back in the fridge.
Intercom::: There is a magma spill on Deck Three. Avoid Deck Three if sensitive to magma.
Soldier 3::: Just passed Garmadon in the hallway. He seems pretty angry.
Soldier 4::: He's requesting a mandatory staff meeting by the fireplace.
Soldier 3::: Is that the room with the lava or the room where people get fired?
Soldier 4::: It's both.
Garmadon::: Well, Generals, congratulations. We finally conquered Ninjago.
Shark General 1::: I'm not... certain we did that?
Garmadon::: I was being sarcastic! Every time I try and conquer Ninjago, that meddling Green Ninja thwarts me. Who are these secret ninjas? Every time I come up with a new plan, they still beat me. And they don't even have cool suits! And you guys have like crab outfits and shark outfits. I mean, maybe we're spending too much on outfits.
Shark General 1::: That... sounds right to me, sir.
Garmadon::: Oh, come on. Hey, look, you guys gotta think for yourselves. I'm not your father! Alright?
Angler fish General 1:::Is that a weird thing for him to say to us?
Garmadon::: General number one! Do you want to be a follower, or do you want to be a leader?
Shark General 1::: Uh... leader?
Garmadon::: How dare you?
Shark General::: I mean follower!
Garmadon::: You! What's your title?
Angler fish General 2::: Uh- I'm General number two, sir.
Garmadon::: Well, now you’re General number one.
Angler fish General 2::: Oh- oh.
Garmadon::: And you, what's your title?
Jellyfish General 3::: General... three?
Garmadon:::Well, now your General number two. You see where I'm going with this?
Jellyfish General 3::: No.
Garmadon::: Now. I told the Green Ninja I was coming back with something big, something, wicked, something with some pizzazz. General number one! Go ahead. Give me some ideas.
Angler fish General 2::: Well, sir, I was thinking maybe we could work on the morale of the troops? They're always scared of being-
Angler fish General 2::: -fireeeeeed!
Puffer fish General 1::: We could... do the same thing we did last time?
Crab General 1::: What if we dressed up as the secret ninjas?
Puffer fish General 2::: It’s time we develop a code language!
Jellyfish General 2::: Intimidation. We paint angry eyebrows on the troop's faces.
Angler fish General 1::: What if you just ran for Mayor?
Garmadon::: Oh, come on. How hard is it to come up with a genius idea? Anyone? Come on, jump off. This is a safe place. Go ahead. Just grab it.
Terri::: Excuse me-
Garmadon::: NERD! You’re interrupting.
Terri::: Sorry, sir. We just cooked this up in engineering.
Garmadon::: Give me that!
Garmadon::: Garma-daddy likey.
Cole::: Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Yeah?
Cole::: That's your dad. You were open, man.
Zane::: It was highly poignant!
Jay::: For me, it's easy to fight him because he's like, not my father... But for you, that must be so complicated.
Lloyd::: Not... that complicated.
Nya::: You also really pulled at my heartstrings, man. I felt... for you.
Lloyd::: With the- with the missiles?
Nya::: Nah, with the other- the other stuff.
Lloyd::: The other stuff. Wh- I don’t-
Nya::: The dad- the dad stuff.
Lloyd::: Yeah, but like exactly what are you referring to...?
Zane::: Watching you and your father.
Cole::: The vulnerability.
Jay::: You got so emotional!
Lloyd::: Emotion- emotions were the last thing that were- that was going on out there.
Nya::: Uh, yeah.
Cole::: Mhm.
Nya::: It's okay, Lloyd. Nobody's parents are perfect.
Jay::: I mean, my mom is weird and collects seashells. Your dad levels cities and attacks innocent people. So. They've all got their quirks, you know?
Cole::: Uh- wh- where's that tranquil music coming from?
Nya::: Hey look, everyone! Master Wu is back!
Wu::: Hello, students.
Ninja::: Master Wu!
Zane::: Shock.
Cole::: How was your trip?
Wu::: It was a deep spiritual journey that took me to depths inside myself I never knew existed.
Cole::: Yeah, you have a pretty serious tan line.
Wu::: Don’t judge me!
Nya::: So, did you see us kick Garmadon’s butt?
Zane::: We vanquished him.
Kai::: Ba-ba-bam!
Wu::: I saw your fight. And I saw Garmadon retreat. But you did not defeat him.
Ninja::: What?!
Wu::: There's nothing ninja about you ninjas.
Jay::: We’re so ninja, I don't know what you’re talking about.
Wu::: You will never truly defeat Garmadon... until you see things from a different point of view. You have the power to win the battle without fighting. When you start using your mind, you won’t need mechs and machines. Your call signs are not just cool names. They are the elemental powers you were all born with.
Wu::: Nya. You can create water on your own! And Kai. Fire!
Kai::: Wow!
Wu::: Jay! Lightning!
Jay::: So ninja.
Wu::: Cole. Earth.
Cole::: We both spin!
Wu::: And Zane. Ice.
Zane::: Ice is nice!
Wu::: These elemental powers are why I chose you to form the Secret Ninja Force. It is the highest level that you can achieve as a Ninja. I wrote a book about it! It's called: Ninjanuity! Copyright Master Wu.
Lloyd::: And, uh, and- and what about me? What uh- what am I?
Wu::: Lloyd, yours is the most important Element of all.
Lloyd::: Okay! Hit me with it.
Wu::: Your elemental power is... Green.
Lloyd::: What's that?
Wu::: Green.
Lloyd::: Okay. So, uh, just to recap. Fire, Ice, Water, Earth, Lightning... and?
Wu::: Green.
Lloyd::: Don't think it's an Element though.
Wu::: Lloyd.
Lloyd::: Can I be Gold?
Wu::: No.
Lloyd::: Wind isn't taken. Can I be Wind?
Wu::: No.
Lloyd::: Earth, Green and Fire. Rolls right off the tongue.
Wu::: Lloyd.
Lloyd::: Could I be the element of... Surprise?
Wu::: No. That's the Fuchsia Ninja.
Fuchsia Ninja::: Surprise!
Lloyd::: There are so many Elements left, this feels kind of purposeful that I don't have one.
Wu::: Enough, Lloyd! Come with me for mentor talk. The rest of you, practice Spinjitzu.
Kai::: That's easy. Watch this.
Zane::: Exertion.
Wu::: For three hours.
Jay::: Three hours?!
Ninja::: What?
Jay::: Are you kidding me with this guy?
Wu::: And read my book!
Jay::: Oh, man!
Nya::: Ugh.
Lloyd::: Master Wu, you don't understand. Right now, on that volcano, Garmadon is making something really big. He's building something huge, and something... surely shark-themed. And he's going to come back sooner rather than later. So what do I do?
Wu::: Nephew, weapons alone will not solve your problem. I have every kind of weapon in my dojo. Big weapons, little weapons, sharp weapons, dull weapons, even the Ultimate Weapon, but the strongest weapon is inside you.
Lloyd::: Wait, I'm- I’m sorry. What did you just say?
Wu::: "The strongest weapon is inside you"?
Lloyd::: No, no, no, no, no. Before that, the thing right before that?
Wu::: What? You mean...?
Disembodied voice::: THE ULTIMATE WEAPON!
Lloyd::: And you've been hiding this why?
Wu::: In the wrong hands, the Ultimate Weapon could spell doom for Ninjago.
Lloyd::: Put that in my hands! Why does it matter how we defeat Garmadon as long as we beat him?
Wu::: Because, nephew, right now? Your hands are the wrong hands.
Wu::: Lloyd. I'm his brother. I too feel responsible for the safety of Ninjago. But I will not always be here to train you.
Lloyd::: Why?
Wu::: Because. I'm super, super... old.
Lloyd::: Oh.
Wu::: That's why I need you to lead the Secret Ninja Force. But you must promise to walk a different path. One only the son of Garmadon can walk, no matter how hard it may be.
Lloyd::: Honestly... I would happily give up being a secret ninja... if it meant I didn't have to be the son of Garmadon.
Wu::: I know you’ve had a hard life, Lloyd, filled with many knocks. Why don’t I play you a song? Perhaps it would speak to you.
Lloyd::: Thanks Uncle Wu.
Koko:::No, no, I don't know where he is. No, he hasn't come home from school. No, he did not join forces with his father. That is ridiculous. Yeah, like your husband’s a saint.
Koko:::I’m trying not to freak out right now, but I have called eighteen people and I cannot locate my son. Yes, I know you said you never wanted him to play with your kids, I just didn't know if he would be-
Koko::: Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Hey, mom.
Koko:::No, I’ve got him right here, he just walked in! Buh-bye.Oh my gosh, I was so worried about you.
Lloyd::: I- I'm fine. I- I just... took the long way home.
Koko::: Why did we get on a family plan if you're not going to text me?
Lloyd::: I’m so sorry, I didn't mean to worry you, I- I love you and I'm sorry.
Koko::: I don't know what I’d do if anything ever happened to you, okay?
Lloyd::: Thanks mom.
Koko::: I'm just really glad that those ninjas saved the day.
Lloyd::: Yeah. Yeah. I was, I was there.
Koko::: What?
Lloyd::: Watching... with the other regular kids.
Koko::: Okay, well, you must be starving.
Lloyd::: I don't know. I'm not... really that hungry.
Koko::: But I'll make your favourite! Dumplings!
Lloyd::: Oh! Enticing! But... I'm just gonna- I'm just going to go to bed I think. Just really...tired.
Koko::: Oh.
Lloyd::: Goodnight, mom.
Koko::: Okay, well, good night.
Radio::: And back at number one with a bullet, no surprises there, is 'Boo Lloyd: The Remix'! L-L-L! L-L-L-L-O-Y-D! L-L! L-L-L-L! L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-O-Y-D, his dad is bad and so is he! Boo Lloyd! Boo Lloyd! Boo Lloyd!
Beach-goer 1::: Huh?
Beach-goer 2::: What is that?
Garmadon::: Hey, Green Ninja, I’m back! And look what I’ve brought with me! 
Robin::: Breaking News. Garmadon is attacking the city, in a never-before-seen mech!
Citizen 1::: Run! Run!
Citizen 2::: Garmadon!
Citizen 3::: Garmadon!
Citizen 4::: Garmadon!
Garmadon::: Ah, you all came out to greet me? Hey, don't run away. That's a nice little hot dog stand you got there. Ker-smash!
Robin::: The ninjas are going to have their hands full with this thing!
Ninja::: Ninjaaa GO!
Omar::: We got a message from your brother, Garmadon. You want to hear it?
Wu::: Oh yeah? What did he say?
Omar:::He says you're a big, stupid, dumb, dumb with a dumb face and a big butt and your butt stinks and you smell like a butt.
Wu::: ...That sounds like my brother.
Omar::: Get him!
Lloyd::: Jay!
Jay::: Yeah?
Lloyd::: You take the air! Kai, Zane, Cole, downtown! Nya, water.
Nya::: Got it!
Lloyd::: I'm going after Garmadon.
Jay::: Why don't I take your dad this time?
Lloyd::: I got this. I’m totes profesh.
Kai::: Wait, what does that mean?
Nya::: I think he's trying to say he's a total professional?
Kai::: Then why is he totes abbreving?
Zane::: I'm pretty sure Lloyd’s nervous.
Lloyd::: What?! That’s... crazy talk.
Zane::: Incorrect.
Lloyd::: Hey, I got this! Stand down, Garmadon!
Garmadon::: Well, hello, Green Ninja!
Lloyd::: It's time for you to Ninja-go away for good. Take this!
Computer::: Mega missile mode. Left claw missile. Toenail missile. Wrist rocket. ? Spine missile, one, two, three, four. Tongue rocket. Tail rocket, one, two. Eye missile. Other eye missile. Head missile. Other head missile. Backup head missile. Butt torpedoes.
Garmadon::: Your weapons are powerless against my new mech.
Lloyd::: What? Well, take this!
Computer::: Releasing full payload.
Lloyd::: Here it c-
Computer::: Alert! Alert!
Garmadon::: You having trouble with that dragon mech, Green Ninja? Buh-bye!
Lloyd::: Wait!
Lloyd::: Noooo!
Cole::: Jay, what's happening?
Jay::: Garmadon has taken out Lloyd!
Kai::: What?!
Nya::: Wait, what?!
Cole::: I'm sorry, what did you say?
Jay::: Repeat: GARMADON’S TAKEN OUT LLOYD!
Michael::: It looks like the police, the army and the coast guard have all been rendered useless by Garmadon’s forces.
Cole::: Guys, Garmadon’s almost at city hall!
Kai::: Can one of you stop him?!
Nya::: I’m swamped down here.
Jay::: A little busy!
Garmadon::: Ha ha ha! Look at me go! Who wants a shark? You want a shark? You get a shark!
Worker::: Come on, come on, come on!
Garmadon::: Oh! Ah! Just walking- to the top!
Kai::: Uh, Lloyd would be really beneficial right now!
Jay::: Aaargh! Where are you, Lloyd?
Wu::: I’m a ninja master! You are no match for me!
Wu::: I came here to drink boba and kick butt. And I’m all out of boba.
Garmadon::: Hey, Ninjagooo!
Michael::: Oh, wait, that’s bad.
Robin::: Garmadon is conquering Ninjago!
Michael::: Robin, this is a day that will live in infamy! I just made that up!
Robin::: No, you didn’t.
Michael::: Yes I did! Copyright Michael Strahan. That's mine now!
Garmadon::: Woo! I’ve done it! I’m finally the ruler of Ninjago! Forever! And ever! 
Lloyd::: Stand down, Garmadon!
Garmadon::: Green Ninja? And... the legendary Ultimate Weapon?! Ugh, it's not fair.
Lloyd::: I'm sick and tired of you trying to conquer Ninjago!
Garmadon::: Alright, Green Ninja. Now, listen, just calm down... You don't have to use that thing.
Lloyd::: So you're going to leave Ninjago?
Garmadon::: Yeah!
Lloyd::: Forever?
Garmadon::: I promise.
Lloyd::: What- what are you- why is your hand behind your back? What are you doing back there? Are you crossing your fingers?
Garmadon::: That's... physically impossible. I can't- How could I be crossing my fingers? I have these things.
Lloyd::: I'm warning you, Garmadon!
Garmadon::: Fine, no crossies! No crossies! Just chill. Okay, look, I'm getting rid of all my sharks, see? No sharks.
Lloyd::: And the sharks in your ankle holster?
Garmadon::: I don't have any sharks.
Lloyd::: What's in your ankle?
Garmadon::: It’s a cup of dolphins, man! Come- Now you’re acting loco! I mean- This is just-
Lloyd::: Get rid of ‘em!
Garmadon::: Fine.
Garmadon::: You happy now? I'm done. You win.
Lloyd::: What are you doing? What are you doing right now?
Garmadon::: Easy, Green Ninja.
Lloyd::: Don't come any closer!
Garmadon::: Easy...
Lloyd::: I'm warning you, Garmadon!
Garmadon::: Let's just keep this interaction very chill.
Lloyd::: I'm the definition of chill right now!
Garmadon::: I know!
Lloyd::: Stand back!
Garmadon::: Put down the Ultimate Weapon, Green Ninja. We both know you're not going to fire it.
Lloyd::: Oh yeah? This is your last chance. Get out of Ninjago. Now and forever!
Garmadon::: No.
Lloyd::: Alright, fine. You ready for this?
Garmadon::: Yeah!
Lloyd::: It's coming!
Garmadon::: Okay!
Lloyd::: You’ve been warned!
Garmadon::: I'm waiting!
Lloyd::: Here it comes!
Garmadon::: Anytime!
Lloyd::: Alright! Here... it... comes!
Garmadon::: Oh my gosh! He actually shot-! And it exploded! And then-! But nothing... is happening. Why is nothing happening?
Lloyd::: What the heck?
Garmadon::: It’s like the Ultimate Lamest Weapon.
Lloyd::: Come on! Why won't you work?
Garmadon::: You hear that?
Garmadon::: What have you done?
All::: Awww!
Lloyd::: How- how do I turn this thing off?
Garmadon::: Ah!
Lloyd::: Come on!
Garmadon::: Generals! Grab the Green Ninja!
Lloyd::: Keep away!
Lloyd::: Hey- wait! No, no no!
Garmadon::: Remember, Green Ninja. I didn't fire this thing first, that's on you. But! Since you've got it all warmed up... let’s try it on some moving targets!
Lloyd::: No!
Cole::: What the heck?!
Lloyd::: Stop it, Garmadon, just stop it!
Nya::: What is this thing?!
Jay::: I’m gonna throw up!
Zane::: Prolonged scream!
Garmadon::: Five ninjas down. One to go.
Garmadon::: Bang! I win! Cue the music!
Garmadon::: What? Are you gonna cry?
Lloyd::: I'm not gonna cry.
Soldier::: I bet he’s gonna cry.
Lloyd::: I'm not gonna cry... dad.
Garmadon::: Luh-Lloyd?
Lloyd::: That's right. It's me. Your son! And it's Lloyd, dad!
Garmadon::: No. L-L-O-Y-D. I named you.
Lloyd::: You ruined my life!
Garmadon::: How can I ruin your life? I wasn't even there!
Lloyd::: I wish you weren't my father.
Crew Member::: And we're back in three, two, one.
Robin::: Welcome back, Ninjago. I'm Robin Roberts. And as you can see, our city is in the midst of total annihilation!
Michael::: And for a city that gets attacked pretty frequently, Robin, that’s really saying something!
Robin::: As we struggle to survive, we're left with so many questions, like: “who has truly conquered Ninjago: the monster... or Garmadon?”
Garmadon::: “I wish you weren't my father.” Like, is it just me, or was that kind of a weird thing to say? “I wish you weren’t my father.” And the tone! So disrespectful!
Hammerhead Soldier::: Yes, sir! Plus, he tried to shoot you!
Soldier::: Yeah! Right before you totally conquered the city!
Conga Line:::We conquered your greatest foe! Turned out to be your son, though! 
Garmadon::: I’m sure he meant it as a compliment, but... It's a weird thing, right? General number one!
Olivia::: Sir! 
Garmadon::: Have you captured my son yet?
Olivia::: No. Not yet, sir. 
Garmadon::: And yet here you are, partying on the rooftops with a paper umbrella in your drink.
Garmadon::: What about Luh-Lloyd's Ninja friends? You captured any of them yet?
Olivia::: No, sir. 
Garmadon::: Then what about my brother, Wu?
Olivia::: No, sir. 
Garmadon::: What about my ex, Koko? You found her?
Olivia::: ...Nooo, sir.
Garmadon::: Well, you certainly had no trouble finding the bar, did you?
Olivia::: We're on it, sir! We searched the whole city from top to bottom!
Octopus Soldier::: Look, you’re not on the list.
Octopus Soldier::: Oh, my clipboard!
Olivia::: Look, here she is now!
Garmadon::: Hey, Koko. Glad you made it to the party. Pretty on the chain, isn’t it?
Koko::: Wipe that smile off your face, Garmadon.
Garmadon::: Ugh, same old Kokes. Just kills you to see me having any fun, doesn't it? Oh, by the way, a quick question. Oh, was it again? Oh yeah. Why did you turn our son against me?
Koko::: Me? You turned him against you, Garm. You're a maniacal twisted villain!
Garmadon::: Alright, look, enough with the compliments. Whose idea was it for him to become a Ninja?
Koko::: Lloyd is not a Ninja.
Garmadon::: Ha! Who's the absentee parent now?
Koko::: Wait, what are you talking about?
Garmadon::: Luh-Lloyd! He’s the Green Ninja. One of my greatest enemies, honour-bound and sworn to destroy me? You know what he said to me? He said that he wished-
Koko::: What have you done with him?!
Koko::: Where's Lloyd?!
Garmadon::: ...My gosh, woman, what happened to us?
Koko::: Ugh!
Garmadon::: I miss that fire.
Koko::: Ugh. You know, I've always tried to get Lloyd to see that he shouldn't be ashamed of who his father is. But now? I'm starting to think he could be right.
Lloyd::: Oh, no. No, no, please, please, no. Uncle Wu...
Lloyd::: Oh my gosh, you guys are okay!
Nya::: Barely!
Cole::: You used the Ultimate Weapon. Not cool!
Kai::: Dude, our mechs are totalled!
Nya::: Now that cat's destroying Ninjago.
Jay::: We were the only people that didn't hate you. And now we hate you.
Zane::: Deleting all data related to treating Lloyd as a friend.
Lloyd::: Guys, I'm sorry. I put everyone in danger, and now... Master Wu is dead.
Wu::: Hello, students.
Ninja::: Master Wu!
Lloyd::: You're alive!
Wu::: Duh! I'm a ninja master. If I was going to die, it would be to teach you a lesson. Lloyd. You have awakened Meowthra.
Ninja::: Meowthra?
Wu::: Yes! Meowthra. The six-toed, fluffy demon, with her sandpaper tongue. Her reign of terror will stretch on, and on, until all of Ninjago is her own personal litter box. There's only one hope, one thing that can drive Meowthra away.
Ninja::: What?
Lloyd::: What is it?
Wu::: The Ultimate, Ultimate Weapon.
Ninja::: Whoa!
Nya::: Where is this thing?
Wu::: On the other side of the island. Hidden where only a true ninja master can find it. You must follow the right path. Otherwise you will end up trapped in the deadly Jungle of Lost Souls, unable to cross the Bridge of Fallen Mentors, and mired in the Canyon of General Unhappiness. And if you’re still alive, you'll be crushed by the Temple of Fragile Foundations. It's a journey many have tried. And none have returned.
Lloyd::: That... does sound difficult.
Jay::: And terrifying!
Lloyd::: But you know what? We're ready!
Wu::: No, you're not. It would take great patience, courage and hard work, all the skills of a true ninja master. So... I will make this journey on my own. Bye!
Kai::: Wait, wait, wait-
Lloyd::: Master Wu, wait- wai, wait- hold- hold on a second- please-
Jay::: Come on-
Zane::: No-
Lloyd::: Master Wu, I know I let Ninjago down.
Jay::: It's true. Lloyd let Ninjago down.Sorry, dude.We want to fix his terrible mistake.
Kai::: Train us to be true ninjas.
Nya::: We have the potential!
Cole::: Come on. Wait! We'll do anything!
Lloyd::: Please, Master Wu. You can't do this alone. I know we're not ninja masters yet, but you said it yourself. It's important to look at things differently. Is there anything I can do to change your point of view?
Wu::: Hmm. Students, are you willing to give Lloyd a second chance?
Cole::: Uh...
Jay::: Well...
Nya::: Too soon.
Kai::: Nope!
Cole::: Pass.
Jay::: Still processing, so...
Wu::: Lloyd. You have a long way to go to regain your friends' trust. Luckily, there's a long journey ahead of us.
Lloyd::: Thank you, Master Wu. Thank you.
Wu::: The fate of Ninjago is in your hands. Are you ready?
Lloyd::: Yes, I am on it!
Nya::: Oh yeah!
Kai::: Yep!
Zane::: Affirmative.
Jay::: Maybe!
Wu::: Let’s go.
Asimov::: Sir, I think we found them. There's a group of brightly coloured ninjas heading towards the obviously dangerous jungle.
Garmadon::: Hmm. Zoom in, a little closer. Closer. Close- clo- no, closer. Closer. Yes! Right in on my stupid brother's dirty beard. What's he saying? Something about a weapon, the... omelette, omelette weapon. Sounds delicious. Delicious, yet quite possibly dangerous.
Asimov::: He's talking about an Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.
Garmadon::: That's what I said. Ultimate, Omelette Weapon.
Terri::: Sir! Where are you going?
Garmadon::: This is pure warrior stuff. Alone in the field, tracking ninjas, finding out exactly what Luh-Lloyd meant when he said, “I wish you weren't my father.” So I guess I'm going to the jungle.
Cole::: Dope fluting, Master Wu.
Wu::: Thank you!
Wu::: Students. Your elemental powers come from this lush, green world. Feel the energy flowing through you.
Wu::: Good, good. The power... is inside you. Now, say to yourself, “I've got the power!”
Ninja::: I’ve got the power!
Wu::: What was that?
Garmadon::: Hmm. Ninja tracks.
Wu::: I sense the presence of evil. Students! A true ninja knows when to fight, and when to become one with the elements. Quickly! Blend in the shadows!
Wu::: You are all terrible ninjas. I will take care of Garmadon on my own.
Garmadon::: I'm close.
Wu::: He’s close.
Garmadon::: Real close.
Wu::: Really close!
Both::: You!
Garmadon::: Oh! Hello brother. Where are your little ninja- ninja nerd- where are your little ninj-nerds? Pft. Nailed it.
Wu::: They're surrounding you, perfectly hidden, ready to strike.
Garmadon::: Oh, really?
Cole::: Caw caw! Caw caw!
Wu::: Students! Next lesson: how to fight like a true ninja- ow!
Garmadon::: Ow! Aaaargh!
Garmadon::: Oh, Look at me. I'm Master Wu! Today's lesson is something totally boring.
Wu::: Looks like you need a lesson, in learning how to shut your stupid face!
Garmadon::: Well, here's something you won't learn in school. The Seven Deadly Butterflies of Shaolin! One two three four five six seven!
Wu::: I don’t need a deadly butterfly to beat you!
Jay::: We are totes blending in right now.
Wu::: I can still see you!
Nya::: Aw, man!
Lloyd::: Come on, this way!
Wu::: Ho ho. Wu’s your daddy?
Wu::: Get off of my head!
Garmadon::: Hey, bro, get off my foot!
Wu::: Get off! Get off!
Garmadon::: Get off my foot so I can kick you in the head!
Lloyd::: Master Wu! Look out, he’s behind you!
Wu::: Where?
Garmadon::: Really? Tighty whities? Still? Face it! You're out of moves, Wu.
Wu::: Oh, yeah? How ‘bout this one?
Garmadon::: Uh oh.
Wu::: I call it: ‘The Caged Monkey’!
Garmadon::: Oh, you have got to be kidding me!
Zane::: Gasp.
Wu::: And that, my students, is how you fight like a true ninja.
Garmadon::: Huh. Well, a true ninja... would have counted all seven butterflies.
Wu::: What? I did! One, two, three, four, five, six...
Garmadon::: Seven.
Wu::: Whoa!
Lloyd::: Nooo!
Ninja::: Master Wu!
Wu::: Lloyd! Always remember!
Lloyd::: Yeah?
Wu::: Stay on the right path, to find your inner peace!
Kai::: No, no, no, no!
Nya::: Oh my gosh!
Jay::: Master Wu! We need you, please!
Nya::: Master Wu!
Jay::: Don't leave!
Lloyd::: Uncle Wu...
Nya::: Did he say... “inner peace”?
Jay::: “The right path”? Why is he bringing these things up so late in our adventure?
Garmadon::: Well, well, well. It looks like your precious ninja master’s gone. Now come on, Luh-Lloyd. Open the cage. Let out your papa.
Lloyd::: So now you want to be my dad?
Garmadon::: I'm not going to ask you again, Luh-Lloyd. Open the cage, right now. One! Two! Three! ...Hm. I thought that was supposed to work with kids. Listen, Luh-Lloyd, and friends whose names I don't know.
Jay::: I'm Jay!
Garmadon::: It's not a question!
Jay::: Oh.
Garmadon::: Now! For you to make it through this journey alive, you're going to need someone to teach you the ninja way.
Lloyd::: What do you know about being a ninja?
Garmadon::: Oh, I know plenty, Luh-Lloyd. You don't get to be a warlord without knowing a thing or two about the ninja arts. The dark ninja arts.
Jay::: Aargh! What is that?
Kai::: You're a ninja?
Garmadon::: Indeed I am. As a matter of fact, I wrote the book on Ninjelligence.
Jay::: Why are there so many one-star reviews?
Garmadon::: I think that's trolls, personally.
Jay::: Oh.
Lloyd::: We don't need your book, Garmadon. Wu is our master.
Garmadon::: Well, Wu is gone. And you’re gonna need me to get you out of this jungle, or you're all going to die.
Jay::: Oh, great! We're all going to die.
Lloyd::: We're not going to die, Jay.
Garmadon::: And while I'm keeping you alive, maybe I'll teach you some of my sick dark ninja moves. ‘The Buzzkill’!
Ninja::: Wow!
Garmadon::: ‘The Miso Slap’!
Ninja::: Wow!
Garmadon::: Or ‘The Chainsaw Chop’!
Ninja::: Wow!
Garmadon::: Or ‘The Dance of Doom’!
Ninja::: Wow!
Lloyd::: Hang on, just a second. This is Garmadon we're talking about. We can still make it to the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon on our own. We just have to remember what Master Wu taught us.
Cole::: All I can remember is we really need a ninja master. And you are not a ninja master.
Kai::: So what are we going to do?
Lloyd:::We take him.
Garmadon::: Fantastic. 
Garmadon::: You know what's funny? I had Luh-Lloyd when I was a hundred and fifty eight years old.
Jay::: Wow.
Nya::: Wait a minute. You're a hundred and seventy four?
Garmadon::: Yes.
Cole::: Master Wu says he's a hundred and sixty seven. And he's your... younger brother?
Garmadon::: He's my younger brother, correct.
Cole::: How is that possible? You look much...
Ninja::: Younger.
Garmadon::: Thank you.
Jay::: Yeah, do you moisturise?
Garmadon::: Yes, that's when I got the upper hand on Master Wu.
Jay::: Upper hands.
Garmadon::: Yeah. Upper hands.
Kai::: How did you gain two arms?
Jay::: Oh, don't put it like that. We’ve told you not to say it like that.
Nya::: I don’t know if that’s the best way to say it.
Kai::: Well, he's got four arms!
Zane::: Correct!
Garmadon::: You know, a lot of people don't ask me about it, so it's- I'm glad that he's comfortable asking. Luh-Lloyd's never asked me once about my arms, have you, Lloyd?
Lloyd::: Don't... talk to me.
Garmadon::: I was bit by a snake.
Kai::: No...
Garmadon::: Yes.
Jay::: So the snake had a bunch of arms?
Kai::: They don't have arms.
Zane::: Exactly.
Jay::: Do you mean like, a spider?
Garmadon::: Oh no. I was bit by a snake, and the snake had been bitten by a spider, and then the snake bit me.
Jay::: Oh...
Lloyd::: Are you guys actually buying any of this?
Garmadon::: How else would you explain it, Luh-Lloyd? You weren't there.
Jay::: So when the two extra arms started growing, were you like, “Yes! This is awesome!”, or were you like “Oh, no”?
Garmadon::: No! At first I was like, totally freaked out, and sometimes I get self-conscious about it.
Jay::: ...Hey, uh, Garmadon? Can I ask you another question?
Garmadon::: Yeah, go ahead.
Jay::: It's about the arms. Um. Can you shake your own hand?
Garmadon::: Look! Check it out, ninjas.
Nya::: Oh my gracious.
Jay::: Oh! He's his own best friend!
Kai::: Ahh, the double shake!
Zane::: I love your bad boy charm.
Garmadon::: Look at this. This is one of my favourite things.
Garmadon::: I look like I'm making out with two people, don’t I?
Cole::: I’m impressed.
Zane::: Wonderful amusement!
Lloyd::: Hey, you know what? We should, uh, we should be practising... silence right now.
Jay::: Sorry. It's just... when you talk, I don't wanna listen, but when he talks... I wanna listen.
Kai::: I con- I agree.
Garmadon::: I've always said he's weak voiced.
Lloyd::: I think we're getting off point a little bit! Just a little bit?
Garmadon::: See what I mean about the weak voice?Like, “a little bit”? That's how he talks.
Jay::: Do it again?
Garmadon:::“A little bit”.
Lloyd::: Oh, that's not how I- that doesn't sound like me.
Kai:::He sounds more like this.
Zane::: Look what he's doing to us! We have to focus. He's turning our minds.
Lloyd::: Thank you, Zane. You get it!
Zane:::My sensors indicate a fork in the road.
Nya:::Hmm. The right path is long and arduous and enlightening, and the left... a shortcut!
Jay::: Why would they say possible? They would know, right?
Garmadon::: We're taking the shortcut! Let’s roll!
Lloyd::: No, no, okay, just wait. Master Wu said we should stay on the right path.
Garmadon::: What?! You wanna listen to the guy who fell off the bridge, or the guy who didn't fall off the bridge?
Jay::: Hey, Zane, could you record this, and then never play it back to me?
Zane::: Yes!
Kai::: Um, guys?
Nya::: Maybe this isn't such a great idea.
Jay::: This is my least favourite place I've ever been.
Kai::: Did you hear that?
Lloyd::: We’re backing it out. Back out. We’re backing out. We’re backing out! Back it- continue to back out! Continue to back it out!
Nya::: What do we do?!
Kai::: There’s too many of them!
Garmadon::: Wait a minute. Oh my gosh, Luh-Lloyd. They look like-
Garmadon::: My former General number ones! You guys look great! Your skin has such a lovely glow. Y'all been tanning lately, or something?
Shark General::: We... were fired.
Olivia:::Out of a volcano.
Garmadon::: Ohh! Right, right, right. Yeah, but other than that you're well.
Lloyd::: Uh, Garmadon? Did you fire all of these Generals out of a volcano?
Garmadon:::No! Not all at the same time. Don't worry. These guys are like family. They love me! Right, Generals?
Shark General::: Oh, we’re family alright.
Ninja::: Ninjaaa GO!
Lloyd::: Guys, wait! We need to use our ninja powers!
Jay::: What?! What can we do? We’re worthless without our mechs!
Lloyd::: Come on! Remember what Master Wu told us. Nya, you can make a flood to wash these guys out of here!
Nya::: The only hope for water is if Jay has another accident in his pants.
Jay::: Yeah, she’s right! We’ve gotta get out of here!
Zane::: Ow, that hurts.
Lloyd::: No! No, guys! Use your elemental powers! We have the power! Aaaaaah!!
Generals::: We got Garmado-on! And this random ki-id! We are going to kill them! Oops we shouldn’t have said that!
Garmadon::: I command you to release me and my son! That's an order, Generals!
Bob::: I can't hear you!
Garmadon::: I said I command you to release me and my son!
Shark General::: Hey! The reason Bob can't hear is because his eardrums blew up after you shot him out of a volcano!
Bob::: I can't hear you!
Shark General::: You stupid butt!
Garmadon::: What?!Can you believe what they're saying? It's like I’m being treated worse than anyone in the history of the world. Well, good thing you never have to experience anything like this Luh-Lloyd.
Lloyd::: Yeah. Yeah, no one ever says mean things to me when my dad knocks over their Pilates studio... or their waxing salon... or their kayak repair store! Or that place that sells toner cartridges! And you better believe no one ever makes fun of me for not knowing how to throw or catch a ball.
Garmadon::: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, hold on. I-I know it's funny, but what kind of jerk would make fun of you for that?
Lloyd::: You're kidding, right?
Garmadon::: You gotta stand up for yourself and shoot them out of a volcano! That's how I roll! You got to get yourself a volcano, kid.
Lloyd:::Yeah. Blowing stuff up and never putting it back together. That is what you're best at... isn't it?
Olivia::: Well, hello! We have got a present for you!
Garmadon::: Oh. An exact reproduction of my volcanic lair. And let me guess. You're going to fire us out of it.
Olivia::: Oh, no! We're gonna fire you into the volcano. The fifteen million Kelvin magma will melt your skin before you can even feel the heat! Omar! Take them to the top!
Omar::: Okie-dokie.
Shark General::: Up we go!
Jay::: Aahhh! What is that?!
Nya::: Hey!
Jay:::What's up?
Zane::: Peow! Peow peow peow!
Nya::: Zane! Are you okay?
Zane::: I think I might be an adrenaline junkie.
Kai::: I got you, dude! I got you!
Cole::: I really could have walked out by myself, but thank you.
Cole::: Ow!
Nya::: Wait! Where's Lloyd?
Jay::: Um...
Kai::: Uh...
Nya::: Oh no... I can't believe we just ran off and left him back there.
Zane::: This is terrible.
Jay::: We are... horrible friends.
Zane::: And sub-par ninjas too.
Kai::: That's right. That's right.
Cole::: Wait! Guys!
Jay::: Um...
Nya::: Oh no!
Ninja::: Lloyd!
Cole::: He's in trouble.
Kai::: Aw, man. What are we going to do?
Nya::: We can still do this guys. We just got to figure out how to be real ninjas.
Jay::: You know what would be really brave? Making camp, sleeping for the night, wake up in the day...
Kai::: Yeah, that's brave.
Nya::: Wait, Zane! Don't you have like seven hundred gigabytes of martial arts movies on your hard drive?
Zane:::Correct.
Nya::: Great! Roll ‘em!
Narrator::: Zane's Martial Arts Movie Club! The Deadly Groundskeeper! Cop Tale 3! The Iceman Puncheth! Furious Fire Fist! Wallpuncher! Good Girls vs Bad Guys! Killer Bills Volume 2! Board Game of Death! Spear Dancer! The Mainframe! Caffeinated Master! H-ip Man! Judo Future Boy! Locke 2: The Joy Locke Club! I Told You You're Wasting Your Time I Vowed To Give Up That Way Of Life! Look Who’s Punching! Look Who’s Punching Too!
Ninja::: Whoa!
Zane::: Ay-ay-ay.
Nya::: I learned so many things so fast.
Kai::: That's right. That's right.
Jay::: I'm ready!
Cole::: Time to get down and dirty. Ninja style.
Ninja::: Alright!
Shark General::: Whoa! Is that a whale?
Shark General::: Whoa!
Angler Fish General::: Aah!
Crab General::: Guys, no swimming. We just ate! Aah!
Nya::: Time to blend in.
Generals:::Fire him! Fire him! Fire him! Fire him! Fire him! Fire him! Fire him! Fire him!
Garmadon::: Luh-Lloyd.
Lloyd::: Yeah?
Garmadon::: Um. I-
Ninja::: Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Guys!
Garmadon::: Oh, hey!
Lloyd::: Oh my gosh! How did you all get up here?
Kai::: Oh man, we did all that stuff that you and Master Wu told us to do. Ninja style, bruh.
Lloyd::: Who-o-oa.
Nya::: Alright. Let's get out of here, and make it to the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.
Garmadon::: It's not going to be easy, girl ninja. Because I fired a ridic amount of Generals.
Lloyd::: Alright, alright, I got an idea. If we can hold these generals off long enough, we can build away out of here.
Garmadon::: Great idea. You kids start building. Luh-Lloyd and I will throw you bricks.
Kai::: Lloyd, I need a two-by-two!
Lloyd::: Here it comes!
Zane::: That was terrible.
Nya::: Throw me a couple of one-bys!
Lloyd::: I got it! Check this out!
Kai::: How can you be so bad at this?
Cole::: Yeah, you got like a mental block?
Garmadon::: Hang on, everybody. You ninjas just keep at it. Luh-Lloyd, you're coming with me. I'll be in charge of the tunes. I'll just put it on shuffle here. Please not Jim Croce, please not Jim Croce.
Garmadon::: Aargh! Jinxed us. Alright, ninjas, keep building! Luh-Lloyd, I’m gonna teach you how to throw.
Garmadon::: Run for it!
Cole::: Lloyd! Over here! I’m open.
Lloyd::: Okay, right, I can- I can do this.
Garmadon::: Quiet your mind, Luh-Lloyd.
Lloyd::: Okay.
Garmadon::: Throw like no one's watching except your judging father.
Lloyd::: Not helping!
Garmadon::: Oh, right! You got this. Do it.
Garmadon::: Ah! Luh-Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Yes!
Garmadon::: Look at that! I actually taught you how to do something!
Lloyd::: Right?!
Lloyd::: Cole, catch! Kai!
Kai::: Right here! I’m open!
Lloyd::: Jay! Your turn, buddy!
Kai::: You’ve got a cannon for an arm!
Nya::: Seriously an awesome throw!
Garmadon::: Luh-Lloyd! Something's happening to my face! It's turning upwards in an unfamiliar motion. Oh, I think they deployed nerve gas! It's happening to you too!
Lloyd::: Listen, listen, we're smiling!
Garmadon::: What is this... smiling?
Lloyd::: Go with it! Feels good, right?
Garmadon::: It does! Oh, this whole experience is so foreign to me!
Lloyd::: I know, right?
Garmadon::: Yeah!
Lloyd::: Alright, here it comes!
Garmadon::: Luh-Lloyd!
Olivia::: Time to fire you ou- AAAHHH!
Garmadon::: Luh-Lloyd! Luh-Lloyd, are you okay?
Lloyd::: Yeah, yeah, I think- I think it was my arm. Is- is- is it bad?
Garmadon::: Whoa!
Lloyd::: Is it bad? I don’t wanna look. I don't wanna look.
Garmadon::: Uhh... It looks okay? I guess? Um...
Lloyd::: Sc- scale of one to ten, how bad is it?
Garmadon::: Oh, I'd say it's about a seven... point... arm-ripped-off?
Lloyd::: My arm is what?! What did you- say it one more time?
Garmadon::: Just- ju- ju- don’t look down, don't look down below your neck.
Lloyd::: Why’re you- don't do that face. Why are you doing that face?
Garmadon::: It's just a harmless little-I gotta puke. It's disgusting.
Lloyd::: Should I look? Aaaargh! I looked, I have no arm! I have no arm! Noooo!
Garmadon::: I told you it was bad.
Lloyd::: Aargh! That's way worse than anything I could have thought! That's bad.
Garmadon::: You're going to be fine! Let me text your mother.
Lloyd::: Dad, no! I need you! Stay with me, be here with me right now, alright? Do something!
Garmadon::: I- Alright- I’ll find- I’m gonna find it. Uh- what does it look like?
Lloyd::: It- it looks like my left arm, except it's the right one?
Garmadon::: Oh, of course, yes. Okay. Everybody fan out, form a grid. Find Luh-Lloyd’s arm. Got a little hand like a cup holder and a black sleeve and a... little piece of green on it. Ehh... You'll know it when you see it. It's Luh-Lloyd’s arm, for heaven's sake!
Garmadon::: This look like it?
Lloyd::: No.
Garmadon::: Alright. Let's try this arm out.
Lloyd::: That's a leg.
Garmadon::: Have you ever had an arm that kicks? I mean, that could be cool!
Lloyd::: Can't say I have.
Garmadon::: Uh... Hey, how about this one?
Lloyd:::That's a sword! That's a sword.
Garmadon::: Oh man. Have a sword arm, that'd be sweet.
Lloyd::: Ugh, you know, the idea of it's a lot cooler than the reality.
Garmadon::: Uh... Oh- oh- wait- wait a minute! Found it!
Lloyd::: Here we go!
Garmadon::: Okay. I'm going to pop that arm back into place.
Lloyd::: Okay, wait- wait, but it's- it’s- it’s only gonna- it's only gonna hurt for a second, right?
Garmadon::: “For a second”? No! It's going to be agony for a while! Like, who gave you that misinformation?
Lloyd::: Alright, alright, alright, just do it! Just do it! Just do it!
Garmadon::: Okay. On the count of twelve.
Lloyd::: No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't wanna do twelve. I don't wanna- Let's do, let's do like a- you know, three?
Garmadon::: Okay, uh. Three.
Garmadon::: One, two...
Garmadon::: Ah! I wish your mom was here to do this.
Lloyd::: You're killing me! You gotta- you gotta just do it.
Garmadon::: Alright. One! Two! Three!
Lloyd::: Wow. It uh... feels, uh... feels pretty good!
Lloyd::: It's pretty good!You did that. Put my arm back on, like a real dad.
Garmadon::: You- you called me dad!
Lloyd::: Yeah.
Garmadon::: Wow! I guess I- I guess I did! I really stepped up there, in kind of a dad way.
Lloyd:::Right?
Jay::: Lloyd! Come on! We gotta get out of here!
Zane::: Guys, we have to go! Hurry! Hurry!
Lloyd::: Come on! Let’s get moving.
Garmadon::: Come on, everybody. Let’s go.
Nya::: I can’t believe it worked!
Garmadon::: Temple, here we come!
Garmadon::: Hey, Luh-Lloyd, look- let me show you how to fly this thing. Hands ten and two.
Lloyd:::I build and drive mechs all the time, I think I'm good.
Garmadon::: Oh, okay, yeah, you’re... probably right, and... 
Lloyd::: Um... What, uh- what- wh- what were you saying? Ten and...?
Garmadon::: Oh! Two! Two.
Lloyd::: Two! Two...
Garmadon::: Yes, ten and two.
Lloyd::: Okay. Alright, alright.
Garmadon::: It's kind of a rule of thumb in driving.
Lloyd::: It's good to know. Good to know.
Garmadon::: And don't forget to check your rear view. You wanna see what's back there. You’ve got blind spots everywhere in this thing.
Lloyd::: Rear view check!
Garmadon::: Keep your eyes peeled. You really want to be looking ahead.
Lloyd:::Noted. Thank you. You want me to really open this thing up?
Garmadon::: Sure! Yeah, let's see what it can do.
Lloyd::: Okay!
Kai::: WHOOOOOOO!
Cole::: Yeahhh!
Jay::: Whooo!
Kai::: Wahoooo!
Garmadon::: AAAAARGHHH!! Okay, that’s enough! That’s too fast!
Lloyd::: You didn’t like that?
Garmadon::: I mean, I liked it. If I was driving, I'd be fine with it.
Lloyd::: Sure, sure. I felt a little scared. Were you scared?
Garmadon::: Uh, yeah! I’m not gonna lie, I might need a change of armour.
Garmadon::: Yeah, I want you to guard the brake a little bit. Let’s-
Lloyd::: Okay, okay, got it! Got it.
Garmadon::: There you go. You’re doing great buddy! Doing great. This is going real- GOAT!
Garmadon::: Goat goat goat goat goat! Aaargh!
Lloyd::: Is everyone okay?
Jay::: Not really.
Garmadon::: Behold. The Temple of Fragile Foundations.
Garmadon::: The helicopter crash destabilised the entire area. And I'm not blaming anyone, but if I ever see that goat again, he and I are going to have words. And you can bet some of those words are going to have four letters, and I'm not talking about goat.
Nya::: Give us the first letter.
Jay::: This is my new least favourite place I've ever been.
Garmadon::: I’ve spent a lot of time here. And trust me. Doesn't get any better.
Lloyd::: Wait a minute. So... you know this place?
Garmadon::: Who doesn’t know...
Garmadon::: ...their childhood home?
Garmadon::: Yeah. This place is so unstable, I had to move to a volcano just to feel safe.
Garmadon::: Well? Shall we?
Garmadon::: Stay close. I will lead you through this perilous-
Jay::: Oh, look, a light switch!
Jay::: You guys have a bathroom I could use?
Garmadon::: No.
Nya:::Fresh fruit! Finally! Food!
Jay::: I'm starving.
Nya::: Ow! Think I chipped a tooth.
Garmadon::: Yeah. My parents were really into plastic food.
Cole::: Whoa. Check out those old photos.
Nya::: Whoa!
Kai::: Yeah! Look at that!
Cole::: Oh! They're so cute!
Nya::: Look at his baby goatee!
Jay::: I mean, Master Wu looks like a really old man.
Cole::: Ha ha! He even schooled you back then!
Garmadon::: Ugh. Whatevs. Come on. Let's go find the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.
Lloyd::: Wait. That's- that's you. And that's...
Nya:::It's Lady Iron Dragon, my hero!
Garmadon::: Yes, Lady Iron Dragon. AKA: Luh-Lloyd's mom.
Lloyd::: Wait, what? Mom was a ninja?
Garmadon::: That's right. She was the most awesome ninja warrior I'd ever seen. I remember the... the first time I laid eyes on her.
Garmadon:::It was during a raging war. I was pillaging a peaceful village with my skeleton army, and I spotted this beautiful warrior queen from across a crowded battlefield. She was fighting for good and... looking great doing it. Even as she decimated my evil forces, I couldn't take my eyes off her. I was speechless. I summoned all my courage to approach her. I asked her if she fought here often. She said, “I do”.
Garmadon:::And let me tell you, Luh-Lloyd, when our eyes met, sparks flew. It was... love at first fight. Your mother and I were a true power couple. I thought we were going to conquer the world together. It was the happiest time of my life.
Lloyd::: Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Lloyd::: If you guys were so perfect, then... why did you leave us?
Garmadon::: It's... complicated.
Garmadon:::One day we came upon Ninjago. I told your mother that I wanted to build our son's future on the ashes of that fine city. But it was at that moment that your mother realised...
Garmadon:::...that the life of a conquering warlord...
Garmadon:::...was not the life she wanted...
Garmadon:::...for you.
Garmadon::: I could have changed.
Garmadon::: But I didn’t.
Garmadon:::And before I knew it... she was gone. And you were gone.
Garmadon::: Luh-Lloyd. Your mom was the best. She expected the best of me, and only ever wanted the best for you.
Garmadon::: I never should have let you go.
Ninja::: Lloyd! We found the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon!
Zane::: Here, in the bedroom!
Jay::: We think it's in that box!
Nya::: Open it, open it open, open it!
Ninja::: Whoooaa!
Nya::: What a bunch of junk...!
Jay::: Maybe there's something important under it!
Jay::: This is the Ultimate Ultimate Disappointment.
Zane::: Correct.
Lloyd::: No, wait. There's a piece for each of our elements.
Lloyd::: Fire.
Kai::: Wow!
Lloyd::: And Earth.
Cole::: This rocks!
Lloyd::: And Water.
Nya::: H 2 O yeah!
Lloyd::: And Ice.
Zane::: Cool.
Lloyd::: Lightning.
Jay::: Aah!
Lloyd::: And I’m... Green.
Lloyd::: But I'm... so happy for- for you guys.Yay...
Garmadon::: You know, Luh-Lloyd, after spending all this time with you and... seeing the amazing ninja warrior you’ve become...
Lloyd::: Yeah?
Garmadon::: I've realised that... we don't need to fight each other... when we can fight alongside each other!
Lloyd::: Really?
Garmadon::: Yeah! Luh-Lloyd, will you go back to Ninjago with me, as father...
Garmadon::: ...and... General number one?
Lloyd::: ...Wait, what, your-? Your General number one?
Garmadon::: Exactly!
Lloyd::: But... but you just said how you regretted letting me go.
Garmadon::: Because you make the perfect General number one! We're an amazing team Luh-Lloyd! You, me, the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon? We'd be unstoppable!
Lloyd::: No... I don’t want to be your General number one!
Garmadon::: But just imagine it! We can rule Ninjago! Together! Come with me Luh-Lloyd. We have so much lost time to make up for. And since I'll no longer be attacking the city no one will hate you anymore! And I'll never forget your birthday again, because we'll celebrate your birthday every day! And think of all the things I could teach you! Tie a tie, ride a bike, conquer a city!
Garmadon::: And if we leave now, we can unleash the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon on Meowthra, and conquer Ninjago together. Come on!
Lloyd::: Dad, please, don't.
Garmadon::: Huh?
Lloyd::: Come back to Ninjago with me and save the city.
Garmadon::: What?
Lloyd::: You'll be a hero.
Garmadon::: But that's not who I am, Luh-Lloyd! People would never see me as a hero.
Lloyd::: But it doesn't have to be this way. This is your chance to make a change.
Garmadon::: I didn't want it to be this way either, but here we are.
Lloyd::: Dad, please. Don't go.
Garmadon::: If I couldn't change then, what makes you think I could change now?
Lloyd::: No, no!
Cole::: Ow!
Zane::: Stop.
Kai::: Oh, no no no no!
Nya::: No, hey!
Garmadon::: Back off!
Nya::: Ah!
Kai::: Hey, that’s my sister!
Garmadon::: Get off my face!
Kai::: Bam!
Jay::: I got it!
Garmadon::: Give that back!
Lloyd::: I can help you! We can do it together!
Garmadon::: Just give me the box and we can talk about it!
Lloyd::: I can't, you’ll just leave!
Nya::: I got it.
Zane::: Look out!
Nya::: Cole!
Garmadon::: Ha! Gotcha!
Cole::: Nice try. Zane!
Zane::: We’re like the Harlem Globetrotters!
Kai::: Here! Here! Here here here here here!
Kai::: Ba ba-da-ba! Hey!
Lloyd::: Over here!
Nya::: Lloyd, catch it!
Kai::: Run, Lloyd, run!
Zane::: Catch it, Lloyd.
Lloyd::: I got it! I got it!
Zane::: Predictable, but credible.
Jay::: Ughhh!
Nya::: Bummer, man.
Garmadon::: Oh, Luh-Lloyd.
Lloyd::: Dad!
Garmadon::: I should have taught you how to catch.
Lloyd::: No!
Garmadon::: So long, Luh-Lloyd.
Jay::: Get out of the way, this whole thing is coming down!
Cole::: What are we gonna do? We don’t have those pieces!
Kai::: Yeah, we don’t even have our mechs! We’re doomed!
Kai::: Oh no, we’re gonna die!
Cole::: What do we do?
Zane::: Our chances of survival are zero point zero, zero...
Past Wu::: Stay on the right path, to find your inner peace!
Past Nya::: Did he say... “inner peace”?
Past Wu::: The power... is inside you. The power... is inside you.
Past Wu::: The power... is inside you.
Lloyd::: “Inner peace”?
Past Wu::: Find your inner piece!
Lloyd::: “Inner piece”, inner piece! Guys! Guys, we don't need those pieces! The Ultimate Ultimate Weapon is inside of you!
Nya and Jay::: What?!
Lloyd::: Yes, you have the power! Look within. Harness what you already have inside and let it out! I believe in each of you! Nya, you can create water. Kai? You can make fire.
Kai::: Okay. Alright, I can make fire.
Lloyd::: The power is inside of all of you. Now calm your mind, concentrate, build up your power. Just think about Earth! Fire! Water! Ice! And you, Jay! Lightning, baby, do it! Jay, you got the power! Say, “I’ve got the power”!
Jay::: I’ve got the power!
Cole::: I’ve got the power!
Lloyd::: Good work, Cole! Go, go, go!
Nya::: I’ve got the power!
Zane::: I, too, have the power!
Nya::: Here we go, come on, hurry up!
Jay::: What now?
Lloyd::: Kai! Your turn!
Kai::: Got it. I’ve got the power!
Kai::: I think I made it worse!
Wu:::Jump, Lloyd! Jump!
Lloyd::: Master Wu?Guys, I can hear the dead. And Master Wu says... Jump!
Wu:::Great job, students!
Ninja:::Master Wu!
Lloyd::: You're alive!
Wu::: Of course. I'm a ninja master, who lives life on the edge, and cheats death at every turn.
Jay::: Wow!
Nya::: Really?
Wu::: No! I thought being dead would make you listen to me more. And I was right!
Jay::: Master Wu! We found our elemental powers!
Cole::: All because Lloyd wouldn't give up on our training.
Nya::: Lloyd saved us!
Zane::: He also decoded your needlessly cryptic metaphors!
Wu::: Lloyd, I'm so proud of you. You helped your friends be great. And that makes you truly a ninja master. Now, let's go save the city from the giant kitty!
Citizen 1::: This cat is destroying everything!
Citizen 2::: Where are the ninjas when we need them?
Citizen 3::: We have to evacuate!
Citizen 4::: Run! Run!
Garmadon::: Hey, Ninjago! Garmadon’s back! Generals! Stop anyone that gets in my way.
Angler fish General::: Yes, sir.
Shark General::: Whoa, it’s the Destiny’s Bounty! I’ve always wanted to shoot at it! Attack!
Intercom::: Alpha team, on it!
Wu::: We have company! Hold on tight!
Shark General::: Hey, where’d they go?
Lloyd::: Alright, ninjas! Follow me!
Ninja::: Ninjaaa GO!
Lloyd::: Nya, we need to get to Garmadon and that cat, fast!
Nya::: You got it!
Garmadon::: Alright, you beast. Get ready to feel the wrath of the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.
Kai::: Here they come!
Nya::: Come on, let’s go!
Lloyd::: Follow Nya!
Garmadon::: Take that!
Garmadon::: Gh- what?
Lloyd::: Zane, freeze these guys out!
Zane::: Copy.
Lloyd::: Kai, make a smokescreen!
Kai::: Yeah, baby! F-f-fuego!
Shark Soldier 1::: Where’d they go?
Shark Soldier 2::: I can’t see them anywhere!
Garmadon::: Eh- what? How ‘bout this?! Hi-yah!
Garmadon::: These things aren’t working!
Lloyd::: Jay! Now’s your chance, buddy!
Jay::: Roger that.
Cole::: Let’s rock!
Garmadon::: Hey! Cat! Back off! I’m Garmadon, baby! I'm the greatest warlord of all- Aaahh!
Garmadon::: Oh! Somebody help me!
Lloyd::: Dad?
Citizen 1::: Go, ninjas, go!
Chad::: Hip, hip hooray! The cat ate Garmadon!
Citizen 2::: Now all they have to do is take out the cat and Ninjago is safe!
Citizen 3::: Get ‘em!
Citizen 4::: Take out that monster!
Citizen 5::: Whack that cat with your awesome hand powers!
Garmadon::: Luh-Lloyd! Please help me!
Kai::: Oh, I can use my fire! But is that... too much?
Nya::: Or I could blast them with my water! Cats hate water!
Lloyd::: You were right, Master Wu. I need to walk the path that only the son of Garmadon can walk.
Chad::: Oh, my gosh. the Green Ninja is... Lloyd Garmadon?
Koko:::Lloyd!
Jay::: All we have to do is scare off Meowthra and we've won!
Lloyd::: ...No.
Jay::: What?!
Kai::: Uh, Lloyd. Where are you going?
Zane::: Lloyd? Come back!
Lloyd:::Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. 
Lloyd:::Yeah. Come here.
Koko::: Lloyd! No!
Wu::: It's okay. He's got this.
Lloyd::: That’s a good kitty. You're okay. Yeah, you’re okay.
Lloyd::: Shhh, yeah. Yeah, that’s a good kitty. What a sweet, sweet kitty.
Lloyd::: Everything's going to be just fine. Hey. I know it. I know you don't mean to destroy everything.When, uh- when people look at you... they see a monster. But... I know that you just- you just feel scared... and alone.
Lloyd::: I know how that feels. To be judged unfairly. So, um. Just want to say that... I forgive you. And... I'm sorry. When I said, “I wish you weren't my father”... I didn't really mean it. What I- What I should have said is... I wish we didn't fight all the time. I’m- I just- I wish I could have spent... more time with you. And that- that you could have seen, like, everything I've been through. But- but you weren't there. And it- I just- I don’t- I- I wish we could get that time back. I need my dad. I just- I need my dad.
Garmadon::: Oh! Whoa! Whoa.
Lloyd::: Dad? Are- are- are you okay?
Garmadon::: Yeah. Fine.
Lloyd::: You’re alive!
Garmadon::: Son?
Lloyd::: Yeah?
Garmadon::: Did you... mean all that stuff you said? To the cat?
Lloyd:::Every word.
Garmadon::: Well. I know for a fact that the cat feels exactly the same way. 
Lloyd::: Dad? Are you... crying?
Garmadon:::Ugh- No. It's just that I’m... kinda allergic to the cat. 
Koko::: Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Mom!
Koko::: Let me- let me look at you. Let me look at you. Are you hurt? Let me see your fingers and toes. Okay. You still don't have fingers and toes, that's good! Is everything okay?
Lloyd::: I’m- I’m fine. I'm- I'm good.
Koko::: Lloyd, I was so worried about you!
Lloyd::: Mom. Mom, wait! I'm, uh- I’m sorry.
Koko::: It's okay. I'm just- I'm just so happy you're all right.
Lloyd::: No, mom, I'm really sorry. I took you for granted. All you ever did was support me. The real me, the person I am on the inside.
Koko::: Oh.
Lloyd::: I’m really sorry, mom.
Koko::: I love you so much.
Lloyd::: I love you too.
Garmadon::: Bring it in. Let's hug this out.
Garmadon::: Okay! That's cool. Uh... got two people to hug me over here!
Lloyd::: Uncle Wu? I know why you wanted me to be the Green Ninja.
Wu::: Oh, you do?
Lloyd::: Yeah. Green is the colour of life. It flows through all living things... connecting them all. The way I connect the ninjas.
Lloyd::: Or... the way I connect my family... whether we're together or not.
Wu::: Some powers are ones you cannot see, but those are the most important powers of all.
Wu::: Lloyd was a hero.
Garmadon::: Who are you talking to?
Wu::: He saved Garmadon! And he saved his family.
Garmadon::: We're standing right here.
Wu::: And the whole city of Ninjago. 
Garmadon::: Where are you going?
Wu::: They even made Meowthra the mascot!
Citizen 1::: She’s so fluffy, I love her!
Garmadon::: Wu! Come back!
Wu::: Koko and Nya opened a school to teach former Shark Generals life skills.
Wu::: And Garmadon taught Lloyd something very important.
Garmadon::: Hey! Catch!
Mr. Liu::: And Lloyd taught everyone that even if you're different, you can still do great things.
Boy::: Whoa. So does that mean I’m a ninja now?
Mr. Liu::: No. All you did was listen to a story. Doesn't make you a martial artist.
Boy::: Or does it?
Mr. Liu::: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Listen. To be a master... it takes patience, hard work, courage... and...
Boy::: Whoa...
Mr. Liu::: Good. Your training begins at dawn.
Boy::: Whoa!
Mr. Liu::: Whoa!
Boy::: Can we bring the cat?
Mr. Liu::: No!
