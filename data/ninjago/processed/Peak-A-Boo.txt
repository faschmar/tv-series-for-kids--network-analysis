Kai::: Seriously! 
Ronin:::Aww, just short. Like your temper, Kai.
Jay::: Let me try. I'm for sure better Airjitzuer than you, Kai.
Kai::: Oh, yeah? And when did that happen?
Jay::: Like, now! 
Kai:::Oh, yeah. That was so much better than me.
Jay::: It...it was.
Ronin::: That wasn't Airjitzu, that was Failitzu.
Kai::: Or Stupiditzu.
Wu::: To master the powers of Airjitzu, we must uplift, not put each other down, Ronin.
Ronin:::You close shop for a week, you gotta let me have some fun. Aren't Nindroids supposed to be precise?
Kai:::These new suits are heavy. Why can't we just use our old ones?
Wu::: These are embedded with Deepstone. They will protect you from being possessed.
Jay::: Yeah, well, maybe the name "Airjitzu" isn't uplifting enough. Maybe we need something more inspiring, like...Cyclondo! 
Ronin::: Miss. Again.Hey!
Jay:::Cyclondo.Mm.
Nya::: Don't feel like training?
Cole::: In case you haven't heard, I'm a Ghost. And don't tell me we can fix this 'cause we can't. This is just...who I am now.Ugh. I don't feel anything anymore.
Nya::: Sensei told us our paths in life are never a straight line. Take me for instance, I thought I was always destined to be Samurai X, but now I'm training to become the Water Ninja no matter how horribly awful I am at that. All I know is, ninja never quit!
Cole::: But I'm not a ninja anymore. I'm a Ghost.
Nya::: Then what do you do? I think that's something you have to answer on your own.
Kai::: Misako's about to debrief us about the next clue.
Nya::: We'll be there in a moment.
Kai::: And sis, that color suits you well.
Nya::: Thanks. It's my favorite color.
Cole::: No, Nya. Thank you. 
Misako::: Now that both Morro and you have Airjitzu, it's time to turn our attention to the second clue, the Sword in the Cloud.
Kai::: I thought you said you fixed his voice?
Jay::: I did. And then I made it better.
Zane::: ...the Sword of Invisibility, the Sword of Invincibility...
Kai:::You're right, he is better. 
Zane::: ...the Blade of Ruin.
Misako::: Aye, Zane. And to add to your colorful account, there are many more swords, but it wasn't until Morro and his allies commandeered Nya's Samurai Mech that it all became clear. It's the Sword of Sanctuary, protected in the Cloud Kingdom.
Ronin::: Heh, Cloud Kingdom? I know every square inch of Ninjago. There ain't no place called the "Cloud Kingdom."
Wu::: You're right, it isn't in Ninjago. It's in a parallel Realm that can only be reached through the Blind Man's Eye.
Nya::: The Blind Man's Eye? You mean the powerful storm cyclone above the clouds? But its altitude is far too high for the Bounty to reach.
Misako::: Unless we ascend the tallest mountain in Ninjago. The Wailing Alps.
Wu::: Yes, the Wailing Alps. When the Blind Man's Eye passes its peak, you four ninja will jump into the eye of the storm using Airjitzu to cross over into Cloud Kingdom to take possession of the Sword of Sanctuary.
Jay::: Whoa, whoa, Sensei, you're throwing around some big words here, but I think you got one wrong. It's Cyclondo, not Airjitzu.
Cole::: So this Sword of Sanctuary that we're after, what makes it so special?
Wu::: It's special because reflected within its blade, you can foresee your next opponent's next move.
Misako::: And whoever gets it will have a huge advantage. Lights please.This is about more than finding the next clue to the Spinjitzu Master's Tomb. This is about saving my son. You cannot fail.
Kai::: Then let's gear up. We have one big mountain to climb.
Jay:::It's getting really cold.
Kai::: Freezing if you ask me.
Nya::: Boys, we need down below. Without your mechs, you'll never be able to survive the extreme conditions on your own. I've also installed headsets into your hoods for easy communication. Try it out.
Jay:::Tell me Zane, how tall is this mountain?
Zane::: The precise elevation of the Wailing Alps be well over three leagues and twenty eight fathoms.
Jay:::Zane's so much cooler.
Ronin::: Remember, once you get to the peak, you'll only have one shot to shoot the Blind Man's Eye. Don't miss.
Cole:::I don't know, guys, you had time to practice. Maybe I should sit this one out.
Kai::: Don't even think about it. You may be a Ghost, but you're still part of the team.
Jay::: And if it weren't for you getting the first clue, we wouldn't even be here.
Nya::: So what are you gonna do, Cole? Are you in, or out?
Cole::: Open the hangar doors.
Ronin::: Opening hangar doors!
Jay::: Whoo-hoo! Haha. Is anyone else getting a tingling feeling?
Kai::: Yeah. Frostbite.
Ronin::: Drop 'em!
Ninja::: Ninja, snow! 
Kai::: Cole, are you okay?
Cole:::Gotta work on that landing. Hey, you sure you want me along? I can hardly control my new body, let alone this piece of metal.
Jay::: Hey, we all have our bad days. We'll pick you up so next time you can return the favor.
Zane::: Jay be right. The only way we're gettin' up ye mountain is if we be a hardy crew.
Kai::: This isn't about who's a ninja, a Nindroid, or even a ghost. Above all else, we're brothers. And as iron sharpens iron, brother sharpens brother.
Cole::: All right, brothers. Let's do this.
Nya::: The Blind Man's Eye will be passing the peak in T-minus four hours.
Wu::: Good, then if there isn't any trouble, they should be able to get there in time.
Ronin::: Just out of curiosity, why is it they call it the Wailing Alps?
Misako::: Because when the unnaturally strong wind gusts blow through the canyons, it creates a wailing sound. They say some gusts are strong enough to blow someone clear off the face of the mountain.
Ronin::: Right. No trouble at all.
Cole::: Heh. Not so bad when you get the hang of it.
Jay::: So this Sword of Sanctuary. You really think you can see all of your opponents' attacks? If we had that kind of power, not even Morro could stop us.
Kai::: But if Morro got his hands on it, nothing would stop him, which is why we cannot fail. We just have to keep climbing. Ugh, Zane. How much further is it to the top?
Zane::: Thar be a long way. At least a hundred thousand steps up.
Kai::: A hundred thousand? Good thing I'm not counting.
Jay::: 267, 268, 269, 70, 71, 72, 72—oh, look, a little goat!
Kai::: That's not a goat. Don't you remember? We rode one of those.
Jay::: Its got horns. It's a goat.
Kai::: Even giraffes have horns. And that's not a goat. It's a yak.
Jay::: A yak? No way. Maybe it's a cow.
Kai::: I'm about to have a cow.
Zane::: Arr, look! Tracks!
Kai::: Maybe another yak?
Jay::: Or a cow!
P.I.X.A.L.::: These tracks are fresh, Zane. Be careful.
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L. has analyzed ye tracks. We not be the first ones to climb this pass today.
Kai::: You think it was Morro?
Jay::: Who else is crazy enough to be at this altitude. If he's ahead us, we're bound to cross paths.
Cole::: What's that sound?
Zane::: Wind gust! Anchor down! 
Kai::: Hold on, everyone!
Cole::: I can't hold on!That was close. I owe you one.
Kai::: Come on, there's still a lot of mountain to go.
Morro:::So they are following us.
Soul Archer::: We're too far ahead. They'll never catch us.
Bansha::: What is it, Morro?
Morro::: Lloyd's spirit continues to fight my possession. He's getting stronger.
Bansha::: Bah! You have already lost the Allied Armor, we cannot fail to secure the Sword of Sanctuary.
Soul Archer::: We could go faster if you abandon Lloyd's body. These winds don't affect us Ghosts.
Bansha::: Our master would want us to—
Morro::: The Preeminent is not here, I am. And need I remind you only a Spinjitzu Master can find the tomb? If I leave Lloyd's body now, the Sword would be useless. Our master sent me to find the tomb, so until she's freed, you serve me. Understand?
All::: Yes, Morro.
Bansha::: At least let me slow them down. You summoned us for a reason.
Morro::: Very well. Send them a message. Something they'll hear loud and clear.
Jay::: Now what's that sound?
Cole::: Another gust?
Kai::: Worse. Avalanche! Here it comes! Hold on!
Cole::: I can't control my mech!
Jay::: Me either.
Kai::: The avalanche is too strong.
Jay::: No! 
Cole::: Jay, take my hand!
Jay:::Concentrate, Cole!
Kai:::I got it. Hey, guys, I—whoa! 
Zane::: Blimey, I'm trapped.
Cole::: What do I do? What do I do? What do you do, Cole? You don't give up. 
Jay::: Whoa, Cole, is that you?
Cole::: Just picking you up to return the favor.
Kai::: You possessed the snow.
Cole:::Yeah, I guess I did.
Jay::: Haha! First we get Cyclondo, then we get a ghost on our side!
Zane::: 'Tis good to see you smile.
Kai::: All right, so we're down three Mechs, but we're up in spirit. Still. How are we gonna catch up? We lost a lot of ground.
Cole::: How about we see what else I can do? 
Jay::: Whoo-hoo!
Kai::: It's like your possession has given his mech boosters.
Cole::: Boo-sters? That some sorta Ghost joke?
Kai::: Haha, glad to see your sense of humor hasn't changed. Whoa, Cole, you've transformed it into a spider mech.
Cole::: You know, this Ghost thing isn't that bad after all.
Ronin:::How are they going that fast?
Nya::: It's Cole. He's found his second wind.
Ronin::: Well, they're cutting it close. The Blind Man's Eye will be touching down shortly.
Morro::: The Hanging Temple. The summit isn't far.
Bansha::: Impossible. 
Morro:::You said you got rid of them.
Bansha::: I wiped them off the face of the mountain.
Morro::: Clearly you didn't wipe hard enough. This thing is slowing me down.I'll go the rest of the way on my own.
Soul Archer::: But Morro, the wind.
Morro::: I control the Wind. You three control the situation. Make sure they never make it to the top.
Kai::: Ah. The Hanging Temple. We're not far.
Ghoultar::: Ghoultar fight! 
Jay::: Incoming!
Kai:::Ugh!
Jay and Zane::: Kai!
Jay::: No! No, no, no.
Kai:::The armor really works. I didn't turn into a Ghost.
Morro::: 
Cole::: Morro's getting away!
Bansha::: And you're not! 
Kai::: Who's ready for some exorcise? 'Cause we're about to do some exorcism.
Cole::: Now that is a Ghost joke.
Ghoultar:::Ghoultar chop! 
Cole::: The Blind Man's Eye! We can't let Morro jump through it without us!
Kai:::Don't think we're not trying!
Jay:::Somebody almost got shot here. Where's the archer?
Cole::: On the rooftop!
Jay::: Ugh! 
Cole::: Kai, think fast! 
Kai:::We have to figure out how to get rid of these windbag before it's too late!
Jay::: Oh, speaking of wind. Anchor down!Now I feel like a windbag!
Morro:::Stop it! It's me that controls the wind!Stop!That's better.
Cole::: I wanna get off this stupid mountain. I hate heights.
Jay::: Come on, Zane. Get this tin can back on its feet.
Zane::: Aye, aye, gonna do it. 
Jay::: Now where did the archer go?
Kai::: Behind you.
Jay::: Uh-oh!Haha, I got him! I got him!Aww. And I lost it.
Kai::: Come on, we have to get outta here!
Ghoultar:::Hahaha, Ghoultar never let you leave!
Zane:::Then it's off the plank for you! 
Bansha::: They're getting away!
Soul Archer::: We'll see about that. 
Kai::: Come on. There's no time to lose.
Jay:::Ah! There he is! We're still in this race. 
Kai::: We can do this. We're almost there!
Jay::: Aah! 
Cole::: Concentrate. We got this.
Jay:::Hey! I knew it'd come back to me!
Kai::: We're gonna miss the Blind Man's Eye!
Jay::: Oh, no. All this way for nothing.
Zane::: We'll never make it in time!
Kai::: We will if we do one thing.
Jay::: Cyclondo!
Cole::: But I've never practiced it. What if I don't make it? What if I just blow off the mountain?
Kai::: Don't worry. We'll catch you. Just trust us.I did it! I did Airjitzu! Now you try! 
Jay::: Now it's your turn! I made it! I Cyclondoed!
Zane::: Yar! What about Cole?
Kai::: You can do it, Cole. We'll catch you. Remember, brother sharpens brother.
Cole::: The only thing sharp here is this icicle that I'm holding on to. 
Kai::: Come on, Cole! You're the strong one! Even Jay can do it!
Jay:::Oh, thank you very much, Fire boy.
Kai::: Cole, just jump.
Cole::: What if I can't grab hold of your hand? I'll fall and die!
Kai::: No, you won't. You're a Ghost, and Ghosts can't die.
Cole::: Ghosts can't die. Ghosts can't die. I'll do it. 
Jay::: Oh! We did it!
Kai::: Look! The Blind Man's Eye!
Zane::: We've got one shot.
Cole::: Brother sharpens brother.
Jay::: Cyclondo! 
Morro::: No. No!
Soul Archer:::He missed the window.
Bansha::: There will be other opportunities. But where's Ghoultar?
Nya::: Their beacons. What happened? Where did they go?
Wu::: They made it. They crossed over to the Cloud Kingdom.
Ronin::: What was that?It's a...
Nya::: Ghost.
Ronin::: Fresh catch of the day.
Wu::: Bring him aboard. I want answers.
Kai::: Did we make it? 
Cole::: The Cloud kingdom.
Jay::: Now, let's find this Sword of Sanctuary.
