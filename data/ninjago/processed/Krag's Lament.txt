Cole::: That's right, Krag! I'm sure you've terrorized all kinds of travelers, but you've never faced a ninja before!Ninja, go!I came here to find the Traveler's Tree ! No overgrown ape is gonna stop me! 
Nya::: That has to be the creature those villagers call Krag.
Jay::: Yeah, that's a bad sound. Every time I hear a sound like that, it's big with lots of teeth!
Nya::: And I'm betting Cole got himself into some serious trouble. This is partly our fault, you know.
Jay::: Oh! I had no idea how sensitive he was about losing the Traveler's Tea!
Nya::: Even if he was sensitive, he shouldn't have run off by himself!
Jay::: Oh, I hope we aren't too late! Why didn't we bring weapons?!
Cole::: Where?Oh, no!Ahh!Ha-yah!What? Bunk beds? How many Krags are there? Huh. I guess just one.Burial mounds? He's the last one.Ugh. Don't do it. Just keep going. That's the smart thing. Keep going.Oh, darn it, Cole!
Krag:::Mmm. Om, om.
Cole::: Food? You brought these for me? To eat?
Krag:::Yeh.
Cole:::You didn't always live alone in this cave, did you? There were more of your kind.Your family? What happened to them?Ice Samurai?And now you're all alone, huh? Boy, did I misread things? I thought you were attacking me, but you weren't, were you? You were saving me!The bridge was breaking and you saved me! And then, I attacked you, and you were just defending yourself, weren't you? Oh, wow. Way to go, Cole.Friends?Ahh! Whoa. Oh-okay. I... can't breathe. Put friend down?Whoa! Oh, boy! Whoa! Getting nauseous. Starting to black out.Oh, okay. Listen, d-don't do that again, okay? No more squeezing. Or spinning. A-and, listen. This is great and all, but I didn't come all the way out here just to make a new friend. I'm looking for a tree. A special tree. Do you know where it is?The Traveler's Tree. Do you know where it is?Hey, wait up! Where are you going?Whoa! Okay, whoa, whoa. J-J-Just take it easy.Whoa! Oh, gosh. Okay. Just slow down, big guy. Okay! Careful, careful. Oh. Don't look down.The Traveler's Tree.Thank you, Krag. Because of you, my friends and I have an actual chance of getting home. 
Jay::: This is where those creepy footprints lead.
Nya::: It's definitely the creature's home. Look.
Jay::: That's a really big bed.How big do you think Krag is?
Nya:::Pretty big.
Jay:::I wish Kai was here.
Nya::: Someone had to stay and protect the village.
Jay::: Yeah, but who's protecting us?We should have brought weapons!
Nya:::We're too late.
Jay::: C-C-Cole...That monster!
Nya::: He's gonna pay for that. On three. One, two, three! 
Jay::: Nya! 
Cole::: No! Stop! Don't hurt him.
Jay and Nya::: Cole!
Jay::: We thought that...
Nya::: How!?
Krag:::Friend.
Jay::: Did Krag just say "Friend"?
Cole::: That's what I was trying to tell you guys. He's not a monster. He's, well, he's Krag. Krag, Nya, Jay. My friends. Krag helped me find the Traveler's Tree. He helped me get this. 
Jay:::Are those...?
Nya::: Traveler's Tea leaves?
Jay::: But how? Where?
Cole::: That's what I'm telling you. There's a tree up this cliff. I wouldn't have found it without Krag's help.
Nya::: I'm sorry we misjudged you. We heard some crazy stories and I guess we let them get the better of us, andâ€”
Cole::: Yeah, I don't think he understands all that.
Nya::: Friend? 
Cole::: Again?
Jay::: Uh, what's he doing?
Nya::: I'm about to explode!
Cole::: Uh, down, Krag! Down! Let us down!Krag, how would you like to come with us? Down the mountain.
Krag::: Huh?
Cole::: Krag, come with Cole. Come stay with friend. Okay? 
Nya::: Great! Well, that's settled.
Cole::: Just give him a sec. 
Jay::: What's he doing?
Cole::: Saying goodbye.
