Cole::: Ugh, finally. All fixed up and Serpentine free.
Kai:::Aargh. Ugh, this is frustrating.
Cole and Jay::: Aah!
Kai::: Our weapons are gone and most of our elemental powers are gone. I mean, we can still do Devourer, our tank's out of commission, our Dragon's hurt, and now the Bounty is destroyed, we don't even have a place to sleep.
Zane::: No one ever said being a hero is easy.Though our good deeds may never make us rich, they make us rich in other ways.
Kai::: Yeah, well, I don't feel rich.
Jay::: Ugh. I for one enjoy pitching in. I've always wanted to feel part of a community. Uh, speaking of which, anyone seen Nya? She said she was gonna help.
Nya:::And I have. I may have found us a place to live.
Jay::: Really? But there's a waiting list a mile long to live in Ninjago City. How did you do that?
Nya::: I know a guy, who knows a girl, and she knows this girl who knows a guy. Well, this guy knows a girl who's a real estate agent and she can help you find a place, if you catch my drift. 
Jay::: And where are you off to?
Wu::: We have to find a couple of components to fix the ninja tank. And my dragon ointment has finally arrived. It's a day's trip, but once we get back, he'll be flying again. Also, I love scenic drives. Haha, punch it, Nya!
Nya::: Ay ay, Sensei.
Wu::: Yee-haw!
Jay:::"Patty Keys, Real Estate Queen." Huh, this is exactly what we need. Once we get a roof over our head, we can start properly training Lloyd.
Cole::: Good, 'cause if we know Lord Garmadon, he's not going to be taking any breaks. And let's not forget, the Serpentine are still at large.
Skales::: Serpentine, we've been exiled for the last time. Fear not, I will lead you.
Fang-Suei::: You want to lead us so badly, why should we trusssst you?
Skales::: Because I was the one who told you in the first place not to awaken the Devourer. But no, you listened to Pythor.
Garmadon::: You want a home... I'll give you a home.
Skales::: Lord Garmadon!
Garmadon::: Forgive me, I haven't been myself lately. But now that I have the Golden Weapons, it's time that I got back to my roots. If I'm going to rule Ninjago, I know I can't do it all by myself. The Skeletons served their purpose, but I've always been partial to snakes. If you want someone to follow, follow me. 
Skales::: You are to follow me, not him! 
Garmadon::: You want a home, I give you a home. 
Mezmo::: The power of the weapons...
Garmadon::: I give you the Black Bounty! 
Skales::: Imbeciles! Do you not remember he was just helping the ninja? Now you blindly follow him because of his wizardry? He's not even a Serpentine. Rule with me, and we rule as brothers!
Garmadon::: Rule with me... or else.
Serpentine::: All hail Lord Garmadon! 
Skales::: Oh, darn. Ugh!
Mezmo::: Your eminence, excuse my ignorance, but why is it we fly in the opposite direction of the ninja, when you have the Golden Weapons in your possession?
Garmadon::: Because they have my son, and it is written that he will one day defeat me. What good would turning Ninjago into my own image be when that victory would be fleeting?
Chokun::: Then we destroy Lloyd.
Garmadon::: Aargh! Lock him in the brig! No one will touch my son. But by getting rid of Sensei Wu and those pesky ninja, Lloyd will never reach his full potential. The prophecy will never be fulfilled, and Ninjago will be mine...forever!
Fang-Suei::: Uh, but why are we flying in away?
Garmadon::: Because we are flying to the Golden Peaks, birthplace of the Golden Weapons. Even they have secrets yet to be unlocked. And once I uncover their full potential, nothing will stand in our way.
Patty::: This one-bedroom, one-half-bath is a cozy dream. Who needs extras when everything is in arm's reach? Now, wait until you see the lighting.Uh, who needs lights when you have this view? Heh. 
Lloyd::: Uh, why do I smell old people?
Patty:::Look, doll. I'm trying to work around your budget. This is all you can afford.
Cole::: Uh, this looks...promising. Remember, guys, Sensei told us our main objective is to train Lloyd, not kick our feet up in some swanky suite. If this is all we can afford, this is all we can afford.
Jay::: Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's not rush into any decision. I mean, if it's really all about Lloyd, don’t we need to live in some place that'll make training easier?
Kai::: Yeah, Jay's right. If we have to get Lloyd ready to save Ninjago from his father, shouldn't he at least have his own room?
Zane::: Technically, that does not matter, he only— 
Jay::: We're only thinking about the children, hehe.
Patty::: I do have another property that you'll just love.
Everyone::: Whoa!
Jay::: Oh, man.
Patty::: Now, this is the eight-bedroom Hero Suite. Floor-to-ceiling windows, digital wall television, state-of-the-art game console...
Cole::: Uh, it seems a little out of our price range.
Patty::: Oh, sure it costs a little more, but you deserve it. I forgot to mention, there's also a Dragon keep on the roof.
Kai::: Nice.
Jay::: Maybe we can get a hero discount. After all, we are the ninja who saved the city.
Patty::: I thought Lord Garmadon saved the city.
Jay::: Hmph.
Kai::: We could get day jobs to pay for the extra expenses.
Zane::: We always said we could use a little more responsibility.
Kai::: But we have to train Lloyd.
Patty::: Did I mention the in-house training facility?
Ninja::: We'll take it!
Jay's Boss::: If you're late, no tip.
Cole::: Oh...
Cole::: My feet... I can't feel my feet.
Kai::: There was so many of them. And they wouldn't stop.
Zane:::Ugh, my gears locked up several times. I didn't even know my gears could lock up.
Jay::: I don't even have enough energy to play video games. 
Lloyd::: Oh, but I thought you were going to train me when you got home.
Cole::: Sorry, champ, but we can't until we make rent. How close are we, Jay?
Jay::: Huh, is this jar getting bigger?We're not even close!
Zane:::And our rent is due tomorrow.
Cole::: I can pull a double shift.
Zane::: And I can do overtime.
Jay::: Maybe, I can sling a few more pizza pies.
Kai::: And maybe I can make a little extra if I do the human piñata.Ugh, don't ask.
Cole::: Great, then our priorities are set. Tomorrow.. we make rent.
Lloyd::: And uh, what about me?
Cole::: How about you help out and fetch me some more ice, huh?
Skales::: Our fellow Serpentine follow Garmadon. We're going to have to do something truly diabolical if we're going to earn their respect to win them back. Let's brainstorm ideas on how we can do that.
Skalidor::: Release the Devourer!
Skales::: No, you idiot. We've already done that.
Acidicus::: Release the swarm of evil bees.
Skales::: Ugh, where would we even get evil bees?
Fangtom::: I don’t hear you offering any ideas. 
Jay's Boss::: Pizza delivery. 21st and Union. Get it there in time, or else it's on you.
Jay::: Uh, how much time is left?
Jay's Boss::: Five minutes.
Jay::: But I'll never get across town in five minutes.
Jay's Boss::: Then I guess it comes out of your pocket. Now get going!
Jay::: Oh, no. Aah! Aah!
Woman::: Help! Help!
Jay::: Huh?
Woman::: Help!
Jay::: What's going on?
Mugger 1::: Mind your own business, ninja.
Jay::: No way.
Mugger 2::: It's three blades against none.
Jay:::Blind alley, guys.Attack!
Woman::: Thank you... pizza ninja.
Jay::: Uh, isn't this 21st and Union?
Man::: Sure is, but there hasn't been anything built here in ages.
Jay::: Hmm. Ugh. Hello? Anyone here?
Skales::: So, after you rob the bank, we embark on phase two. Ingenious!
Skalidor::: But boss, when are we going to get pizza? I'm hungry.
Jay::: Rob the bank?
Skales::: Oh, pizza!
Acidicus:::Uh, uh, uh. Where do you think you're going? We haven't given you your tip.
Jay::: Oh, come on, Jay. You gotta warn the others. You can figure a way out of this.Okay, maybe not.So that's the Serpentine master plan. Wicked! Guys, I'm coming! Ugh, hopefully Cole can stop the bank robbery. 
Cole's boss::: Everything okay?
Cole:::Aah! Nothing out of the ordinary, boss.
Cole's Boss::: Thanks for taking the double shift.
Cole::: My pleasure.And now......for a little more beauty rest. 
Cole::: Aah!
Acidicus::: Take it all.
Fangtom::: Shouldn't we wait for Skales?
Acidicus::: No, you fool. He's carrying out the rest of the mission, remember?
Fangtom::: Oh, yeah.
Acidicus::: Let's get out of here. 
Cole::: Huh?
Acidicus::: Let's take the subway.
Cole::: Subway?
Kai::: Trouble? Sounds like they need me. 
Mom::: Not so fast. I still have you for another hour.
Kai::: Uh, but the bank. People are in danger.
Mom::: Not until my son is done playing.Huh. You're fired!
Man::: It's true, at the bank. I hear they stole all that money, and no one's doing anything about it.
Zane::: Uh, uh, I'm sorry.
Zane's Boss::: You're fired!
Zane:::It must be my hard drive overheating. I mean...never mind. I'm going.
Cole::: I'll make it up to you, I swear.
Cole's Boss::: Hmmm, no. Why don't you go home and get a good night's rest, and go ahead and sleep in. In fact, sleep in all day for all I care, because you're fired!
Kai:::Ugh, looks like we're all in the same boat.
Cole::: Eh, that's okay. I hated that job anyway. Let's go. They're getting away.
Kai::: Which way did they go?
Cole::: I overheard them saying something about the subway.
Zane::: Good call. Let's go!
All::: Ninja, go!
Cole::: Has anyone seen Jay?
Jay:::Hello? Anyone? Boy, I think I may have picked the wrong track. I hope I see someone soon. 
Acidicus::: Sounds like we have company, boys.
Skalidor::: But I only heard three. Aren't there four?
Fangtom::: No, stupid. We caught one of them.
Cole::: Ugh, isn't there an easier way to get inside?
Kai::: Not without a ticket. Huh? Aargh! 
Cole::: What?
Zane::: I believe Kai just found it.
Cole::: Nindroids first.
Zane::: Oh, you are such a gentleman.
Kai::: Let me go, snake!
Cole::: Huh?
Skalidor::: Welcome to the part— Unh!
Acididcus::: Care for a drink? 
Zane::: Ugh!
Cole::: Sorry about that.
Zane::: That's quite alright. Venom can't hurt—
Fangtom:::Hahaha.
Zane::: But that stings a little. Let me have this dance, snake. 
Fangtom::: Aargh!
Cole::: One down, two to go. 
Kai::: These Serpentine are a lot harder to defeat without our weapons.
Cole::: Just keep fighting. We not gonna let these fools get away with this.
Fangtom::: Get away? We aren't trying to get away. We're just trying to distract you long enough so that Skales can kidnap Lloyd.
Kai::: What?
Fangtom::: We could care less about the money. We just wanted the boy. Who's the fool, now?
Lloyd::: Whoa. Ha! Haha. Ugh.Wha—
Skales:::Hello, little boy.
Lloyd::: Help, me!
Security System::: Door is locked.
Lloyd::: Ugh, I know. I want it open!What do you want with me?
Skales::: You sssseem to be the only thing your father cares about. But with you in my hostage, he'll have no other choice but to let me lead the Serpentine! Hyah!
Lloyd::: Aah!
Skales::: Let'sss train.
Wu::: Hello? What's going on in there?
Lloyd::: Help!
Zane::: Unh!
Cole::: We have to save Lloyd. 
Kai::: Give me a weapon and I’ll take care of these snakes.
Zane::: Who needs weapons when you can make your own? 
Cole::: Ha! Smart thinking, Zane! Here, Kai! 
Skalidor::: Unh! Uh, uh, uh...this was all a big misunderstanding.
Kai::: Oh, really?
Cole::: Guys, I think I found Jay.
Jay::: Ugh, finally. The way out, hehe.Not good, not good, not good! 
Cole::: Where’s the driver?
Zane::: The train appears to be automatically controlled.
Jay:::Oh, no. Oh, no. Aah!
Cole::: So it's not gonna stop?
Jay::: Aargh!
Cole::: It’s not slowing down! 
Acidicus::: I’m sure they could use your help, but what do I know?
Zane::: Ugh, we're not strong enough!
Kai::: I’m coming!
Cole::: Together!
Jay::: Haha! Hey, there you guys are! Ugh. Um, I could use a little hand here, hehe.
Kai::: Lloyd?
Zane::: He's not here.
Kai::: Oh, we shouldn't have left him.
Cole::: We shouldn't have taken those jobs in the first place. What were we thinking? Losing Lloyd was by far our greatest loss.
Wu::: But it could be your greatest lesson.
Ninja::: Lloyd!
Kai::: You're okay!
Lloyd::: I wasn't going to be, until Nya and Sensei showed up at the last moment.
Nya::: I go away for a day and everything falls apart.
Kai::: I guess you could say we learned we don't need all the fancy stuff. We just need each other.
Wu::: You want us to help you clean up?
Kai::: Well, we are a team.
Wu::: Nya, I think it's time for another road trip.
Cole::: Hold on, I got a better idea.It's not much, but this one-bedroom, one-half-bath is a cozy dream. Who needs extras when everything is in arm's reach?
Jay::: Hey!
Kai::: Ow, ow, ow!
Jay::: Ha, feels like home to me. Hey, at least we get to stay in Ninjago City for a little while.
Zane::: And now without the distractions, we can put all of our energy into training Lloyd.
Lloyd::: Who’s there? 
Kai::: I know the Serpentine Generals got away, but you never told us: whatever happened to Skales?
Wu::: Oh, he found a home, too. But it’s not quite as roomy as here.
Skales::: Mark my words. This won’t be the last you ssssee of me!
Guard::: Lights out!
Skales::: Oh, very funny! You'll rue the day you made a fool of me! 
Guard::: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Garmadon::: The Golden Peaks, birthplace of the Golden Weapons.Yes, it's working. 
Lasha::: Your eminence, are you okay?
Garmadon::: Yes. In fact, I've never felt more powerful! Now, to destroy the ninja...once and for all! 
Wu::: I fear there is a great disturbance in the force.
