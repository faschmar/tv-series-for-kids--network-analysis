Beavers:::Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I do not believe this is the Never-Realm, Master Wu!
Wu::: I've reached the same conclusion!
Beavers:::Fix it. Fix it. Fix it.
P.I.X.A.L.:::Fix this!
Beavers::: Fix it. Fix it. Fix it.
Wu:::Mystake's Traveler's Tea recipe does not appear powerful enough to reach the Never-Realm.
P.I.X.A.L.::: What else can we do?
Wu::: Perhaps we should add more leaves. The stronger the tea, the more powerful the effect.
P.I.X.A.L.::: We are running out of leaves.
Wu::: Which is why it should've been me to go after them.
P.I.X.A.L.::: We have discussed this, Master Wu. It was my assessment that the ninja were more likely to succeed and find Zane.
Wu::: And maybe they have, but the amount of tea they took with them will not be enough to return. We will have to open a gateway for them.
P.I.X.A.L.:::I am tripling the amount of tea. 
Wu::: It's the First Realm. 
P.I.X.A.L.::: I am beginning to wonder if there could be a reason for our failure.
Wu::: Like what?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Perhaps there is something about the nature of the Never-Realm itself that prevents the Traveler's Tea from working? Perhaps it is the only realm which cannot be reached by Traveler's Tea?
Wu::: Let us hope it is not so. Otherwise the ninja are lost forever.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Is it the Never-Realm?
Wu::: I am not sure.Did you hear that? It sounds like the Land Bounty!
P.I.X.A.L.::: I do not believe that is a mechanical sound. 
Wu::: It has to be! Listen!No. Impossible! It's the Departed Realm! No! 
P.I.X.A.L.::: Something is coming through.Ha! Ah!
Wu::: Oh!No!What have I done?! That creature is the Preeminent! The living embodiment of the Cursed Realm! It must be stopped!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Sound the alarm and alert the city. I will take care of the Preeminent.Initiate Protocol Kaiju.Primary laser initiated. Halo jets initiated. Safety protocols disabled. 
Citizens:::Ahh! 
Intercom::: Evacuate. Evacuate. Evacuate. Evacuate. Evacuate. Evacuate. Evacuate. 
Gayle Gossip::: What is that thing?
Vinny::: A slimy tentacle monster. 
Gayle Gossip::: Gayle Gossip, Ninjago City News. On the scene over midtown, where a gigantic creature is attacking the city.We'll be back after a short message!
News Crew::: Ahh! 
Gayle Gossip:::Samurai X! Thank you! 
P.I.X.A.L.::: Thanks are unnecessary. It is the civic duty of all citizens to—ahh! 
Gayle Gossip::: You're getting all this, right, Vinny? You should be getting this.
Vinny::: Oh, uh. 
P.I.X.A.L.:::Preeminent, please desist in this course of action. If you will follow me back to the Monastery, I will guarantee your safe and speedy return to the realm of your origin. Do you understand?Thank you for choosing the path of peace and—ah!Very well. Just remember. This was your choice. 
Gayle Gossip::: For those of you, just tuning in, I repeat Samurai X is battling a giant monster downtown.
Citizen::: Oh.
Gayle Gossip::: Near Borg Tower!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Once again, please desist in your course of action. Ahh!Ahh!
Wu::: P.I.X.A.L., am I reading this right? You're hemorrhaging power. You've got to get out of there!
P.I.X.A.L.::: At this moment, that is impossible. 
Wu::: But your power reserves.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I am the city's only line of defense. There is no backup plan. 
Wu::: P.I.X.A.L., what are you doing?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Attempting to replenish energy reserves.
Wu::: No! Not a power overload! That much raw energy can burn you out!
P.I.X.A.L.:::That is a risk I am willing to take.
Wu::: I don't mean burn out the mech. I mean burn out you! Your robotic body is plugged into the mech's systems! P.I.X.A.L., it's too dangerous!
P.I.X.A.L.::: If this doesn't work, please tell Zane... I love him! 
Wu::: P.I.X.A.L.! P.I.X.A.L., NO!
P.I.X.A.L.::: 
Wu::: P.I.X.A.L.! P.I.X.A.L., are you there?! P.I.X.A.L.! P.I.X.A.L.!
P.I.X.A.L.:::Did it work?
Wu::: P.I.X.A.L.! Yes! It worked. You are amazing.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I did only what was required.
Wu::: P.I.X.A.L., you are amazing.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Does that mean you are no longer angry with me?
Wu::: Yes, that's what it means. 
Gayle Gossip:::And so, the dramatic conflict ended moments ago, when Samurai X defeated the creature, saving dozens of lives—my own included, which is why I would like to end this broadcast with a simple: Thank you, Samurai X.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Well, that takes care of that.
Wu::: It is unfortunate that to return the Preeminent, we had to use the remainder of our tea. The ninja are doomed.
P.I.X.A.L.::: What would you tell the ninja if they were in this situation?
Wu::: I would tell them to not give up hope. Ninja never quit.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Then I think you should trust your own words. The ninja will find their way home. Somehow. Some way.
