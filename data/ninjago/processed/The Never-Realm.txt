Akita::: My land was once peaceful and pristine. But that changed decades ago, when the Ice Emperor imposed his will and corruption upon us and destroyed my people. Now there is no one left to defy him... but I believe one day, someone will stand up against him. I believe heroes still exist.
Ninja:::Ahhh! 
Lloyd::: Everyone... okay?
Cole::: Unh. Great, now I know how my socks feel in the dryer.
Kai::: I think I swallowed my teeth.Whoa!
Jay::: Ow. I'm not liking this Realm so far.
Kai::: Me... Ugh. Neither.
Nya:::We're off the map. Coordinates unknown.
Cole::: Looks like we made it.
Lloyd::: From what Master Wu said, getting here isn't the hard part. It's getting home. The Traveler's Tea?Good. Whatever happens don't— 
Jay::: What was that? 
Lloyd::: Oh, no.
Jay::: What? What is it? 
Lloyd::: No, don't!Gah!
Nya::: We have to get out of here! Now!Cole!
Kai::: Hey! Grab my hand!Come on! 
Jay:::Worst parking spot ever.
Cole:::I thought for a sec.Oh, no!
Jay::: What?
Cole::: The Traveler's Tea.It's... It's gone!
Jay:::Well, that's just great! That's awesome! Now we're stuck on a mountain in the middle of a blizzard with no vehicle, no supplies, and no way back!
Kai::: Ugh. How could you drop it?
Cole::: We nearly fell over a cliff! I had other things on my—
Lloyd::: Guys! This is not helping! Nya, anything on the tracker?
Nya:::Nothing. No signal.
Jay::: No. Of course not. That would be too easy. That would give us hope.
Cole::: So, what do we do?
Lloyd::: We need to get off this mountain before we all freeze to death. 
Jay::: Finally! 
Cole::: Gah, I'm so c-c-cold. 
Kai::: If I-I s-still had my powers, I could whip us up a f-f-fire.
Lloyd::: It'sss not your f-f-fault. 
Jay::: 
Lloyd::: Run!Agh!
Jay::: Lloyd! 
Cole::: Why aren't they attacking?
Jay::: I don't know. That's really creepy. 
Lloyd::: Let's go, before they come back. 
Ninja::: 
Kai::: What happened to them?
Nya::: Whoa.I can hear a heartbeat. Looks like they've been frozen.
Cole:::Frozen by what?
Nya:::Lloyd! I just picked up a faint signal. From the Mech!
Cole::: Where?
Nya:::That way. Due east.
Jay::: But what about these people? We can't just leave them like this. They're still alive!
Lloyd::: There's nothing we can do for them now. We don't even know what happened.
Nya::: We have to keep moving. It'll be dark soon. We can come back and help them when we figure out what happened. 
Nya::: The signal's very faint. Must be some interference or something.
Cole::: Maybe it's the cold.
Jay::: Or the beacon on the Mech is— 
Nya::: Oh, great!
Kai::: I'm getting a little tired of this!
Cole::: Yeah, I think I'm done running. What do you say, guys?
Jay::: Here they come! 
Lloyd::: Let 'em have it! (He strikes down one of the Frost Wolves with his Energy while the other one leaps at him. Lloyd throws it off against a rock. The other wolf runs toward Jay and Nya.
Jay::: Ha-ah! 
Nya::: Unh! 
Kai::: Nya. Use your powers!
Nya:::I'm trying, but nothing's happening!
Kai::: We're surrounded by water!
Nya::: It's all frozen! 
Woman::: Come. Come. Warm yourselves.
Kai::: Thank you! thank you!
Jay:::That feels good.
Nya::: Who are you? What is this place?
Woman::: Oh, this is my home. I am Sorla, of the People of Great Lake. Who are you? Where do you come from?
Lloyd::: Far away.
Sorla::: Beyond the forest?Beyond the mountains?
Lloyd::: Yes. 
Ice Fishers::: Oh! Beyond the mountains?
Lloyd::: We come from...from a place called Ninjago. We're looking for a friend of ours. His name is Zane.
Sorla::: Oh, we have seen no one for many years. We are the last tribe on the ice. The others have fled south, and soon, we too must go. The cold grows too strong. The ice, too thick. But perhaps, Sorla can help. Look, come. Look into the hearth fire.Tell me again of your friend?
Lloyd::: Zane.
Sorla::: And the place from which he came?
Nya::: Ninjago.
Sorla::: Show us, spirits of the earth, spirits of the lake. Show us the fate of Zane from Ninjago. 
Ninja::: Whoa! Wow!
Uthaug:::The Emperor!
Boma::: The Castle of Ice!
Sorla::: I...I am sorry for your loss.
Lloyd::: What do you mean?
Sorla::: You cannot save your friend. He has been taken prisoner by the Ice Emperor. For decades, he has ruled this realm, crushing all who stand in his way. His Ice Castle is on the other side of the mountains. A bitter foul place where the ice is corrupt. A place we do not go.
Lloyd::: Zane is there? In this Ice Castle?Can you show us the way?
Sorla::: You cannot! It is too cold! The ice there is evil! Dark Ice! No one goes there but the Emperor and his Blizzard Samurai. And they are inhuman. Only a fool would go there. Your friend is lost.
Lloyd::: No. I refuse to believe that. Zane is strong. I know him. And he would never give up on us, and we're not going to give up on him!
Kai::: Yeah!
Cole::: Yeah! And if you think we're not fools, you've got another thing coming.
Nya::: Ninja never quit.
Sorla::: All of you speak as one?
Lloyd::: We speak as one.
Sorla::: Your friend is very fortunate. But be warned. The Emperor's General, Vex sees many things. The Dark Ice serves him. If he knows you are here, he will warn the Emperor.
Lloyd::: Vex?
Sorla::: He will send his Samurai. They feel nothing. They fear nothing. They will come for you.
General Vex::: My Emperor.
Ice Emperor::: Why...do you disturb my thoughts?
General Vex::: I bring a warning, my Emperor. Strangers, from a distant realm come to challenge you. They may be here for the prisoner and to defy your rule.
Ice Emperor::: They must be...punished.
General Vex::: They must be destroyed. Show them your might. Show them what happens to those who defy the Emperor.
Ice Emperor::: Send my Ice Samurai. Command them to destroy the strangers.
General Vex::: And all who aid them.
Ice Emperor::: Yes. And all who aid them.
General Vex::: As you command.
