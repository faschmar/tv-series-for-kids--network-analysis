Dareth::: What can you tell us about the Brown Ninja?
Patty::: Brown Ninja?
Dareth::: Heh, I heard the ninja got a friend called the Brown Ninja, who helps them out on their really important missions. Not so much lately, but hopefully again, soon.
Patty::: I've never heard of a Brown Ninja. I think someone's pulling your leg.
Man:::Is that part of the tour?
Patty::: Oh! That is not part of the tour!
Dareth::: Everyone get below! Quick!Ha, looks like the brown ninja is needed once again.Hang on!Hang on, everybody! Nobody panic! Everyone stay calm!
Jay::: Guys, it's happening just like Globby, or, Gloopy, or whatever his name said. The wave is flooding the city. People need help!
Kai::: We're right behind you!
Jay::: Okay, Jay. Time to be awesome! 
Dareth::: Okay, fine. It's not doing much.
Woman:::Oh no. What do we do?
Dareth::: We're gonna have to hold our breaths and swim for it. Okay?On three, I'm gonna open the door, and then everyone swim for the surface. One, twoWhat the heck?Help is on the way. Everyone take a big, deep breath!
Jay:::Grab on! Next stop is the surface!
Nya::: Oh, hey. Hi, Dareth.
Dareth::: Ha! See? They do know me!
Gayle::: This is the scene at midtown, a scene of unbridled chaos and destruction. A scene ofVinny, lift the camera. I'm in the middle of a broadcast! Vinny, up. Ahem. This is the scene at midtown, a scene of unbridled
Wu:::Miss Gossip, this way! Quickly! Wojira.
Kalmaar::: A flying ship! How adorable. After them!
Lloyd::: Grab on and hold tight. Next stopugh! 
Zane::: Get those children to the surface. We'll handle the Merlopians.It appears that we've been surrounded!
Benthomaar::: I'll deal with them! They need to know the truth about Kalmaar!
Kai::: Okay, we'll cover you.
Benthomaar::: Can't you see Wojira destroyed the balance of Ninjago? The beast is everything that the First Spinjitzu Master fought against!
Gripe::: Don't listen to him. He has been corrupted by the surface-dwellers!
Benthomaar::: Listen to me. Kalmaar has deceived you! Kalmaar dethroned the King, not the surface-dwellers!
Merlopian::: Lies! King Kalmaar told us the truth, you traitor.
Zane::: Firing torpedoes, in three, twoNumerically, they have the advantage!
Kai::: There's too many of them!
Zane::: That's what I just said!
Cole::: Hey guys! Need a hand?
Zane::: Cole! You're back!
Kai::: Aren't we glad to see you!
Wu::: Grab on!
Girl::: Thank you.
Boy::: I thought we could use the bathtub as a boat, but it turns out, bathtubs have a hole in the bottom.
Wu::: Yes. Who knew?Get behind P.I.X.A.L., kids. Things are bound to get rough.
Kalmaar::: There!
Wu::: P.I.X.A.L., it's time we departed!I mean leave! Go!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Hold on, everyone! Zane, we have encountered Wojira and require immediate assistance. I repeat, we have encountered Wojira!
Cole::: You guys go. Benthomaar and I can take care of these goldfish.
Zane::: Affirmative!
P.I.X.A.L.::: You may want to cover your ears.
Boy::: Why?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Because nobody fires on my ship. 
Kalmaar::: You'll pay for that! Go. Go! Strike them down!
Lloyd::: Hang on, P.I.X.A.L.! I'll distract them! Hey, Kalmaar! Come and get it! 
Kai::: Lloyd, are you okay?
Lloyd::: Nothing I can't handle. Hit it with everything you've got!
Zane::: The explosive payload of these torpedoes is insufficient to dissuade Wojira!
Kai::: I don't think these torpedoes are doing much, Zane!
Zane::: That is what I just said! Why are you repeating me?
Wu::: Look out! 
Kai::: You're gonna regret messing with our city, Kalmaar!
Kalmaar::: Your city is now my city. And the only regret I have is that I can only destroy it once!
Jay::: Yeah, hi! Up here! Look this way and say "cheese"!Yeah! Take that, you big worm!Not my sub car! Guys, this thing has a century-old morning breath! Aah! And she thinks I'm a chew toy! 
Kalmaar::: You.
Nya::: This ends now.
Kalmaar::: I was hoping you would say that.
