Dareth::: Guys, we need to go! Pronto!
Lloyd::: Skylor, you have to wake up!
Nya::: We have to run.
Dareth::: Run? One of us can't even stand!
Lloyd::: Let's move!
Nya::: Jump, Dareth! 
Nya::: Throw her over!
Lloyd::: That's not going to work.
Nya:::Lloyd!No! 
Dareth::: Lloyd! Yes! 
Garmadon::: You think you can hide from my wrath! I'll destroy every building to find you! 
Gayle:::Everyone should leave the city at once! Nowhere is safe!
Dareth::: Ever since Garmadon lost Harumi, he's lost his marbles!
Nya::: Dareth's right. He's not going to stop until he finds us.
Lloyd::: I know.
Nya::: There's only one thing that can withstand that. I ditched the Battle Wagon across town. If we can get to it... we can leave the city.
Lloyd::: Leave the city?!
Nya::: Just until things calm down.
Dareth::: Lloyd, I'm with Nya. ninja got back. Well, where are they, huh? There's no shame in knowing when to turn tail.
Lloyd::: Okay, we go for the Battle Wagon. But we're not skipping town. We hold on for as long as we can.Where are you guys? 
Kai:::I hope that's your Falcon, Zane.
Zane::: My receptors pick up that, that is a avian scavenger, a harbinger of our approaching demise.
Faith::: It's a Bonepicker, and Zane is right.
Jay::: Why does Zane always have to be right? Can't it just be enough that we're tied to giant poles in the middle of the desert?! And don't forget Wu is being held hostage, forced to steal for Iron Baron the Dragon Armor, so that he can become invincible! Can't that be enough?!
Cole:::No! Don't come to me!Shoo. 
Kai:::Look. Something's going on.
Jet Jack:::Not again... come outside!... Stop questioning me.Oh, come on! 
Jay::: Probably arguing about which one of us to eat first.
Faith::: Dragon Hunters do not eat people.
Jay::: Well, that's good to know, Faith. So, it isn't all bad.
Kai::: This is our chance, while they're distracted. Let's see if we can get these...poles rockingby rocking our bodiesfrom side to side. 
Cole::: Yeah, I'm not doing that.
Zane::: That... won't be helpful.
Kai::: Guys, come on. Teamwork.If we all do it together... 
Faith:::I hope the Son of the Spinjitzu Master figures something out, because this is ridiculous.
Jay::: Hey, it's better than nothing. 
Wu::: Tell me something. Why did you lie to your Hunters? About the Oni being real?
Iron Baron::: I told them what they wanted to hear, that I will keep them safe. And in return, all I ask is to be treated like a king. Is that so wrong? Look around. This is a cruel world. We do what we must to survive.
Wu::: There's more to life than surviving.You already control this realm. Why do you need my Father's armor?
Iron Baron::: There's always more to rule. That's the beauty of power. One can never have enough. Are you sure the Dragon Armor will control Firstbourne?
Wu::: Unlike you, I tell the truth.
Iron Baron::: How very... honorable of you. 
Wu:::The bridge is too brittle to hold us both.
Iron Baron:::Then you better tread lightly.Careful.Keep moving.That was the perfect chance to get rid of me, but you missed it.
Wu::: I gave you my word, remember? Once I get you the Armor, you send my ninja home.
Iron Baron::: There's nothing I would like more than for them to be gone. 
Jet Jack::: You're not in charge! This is not your choice! Listen to me. You don't know anything! Everytime I suggestâ€”Oh, come on!
Daddy No Legs::: Hey, he's just saying what we're all thinking.
Dragon Hunters::: Yeah!
Jet Jack::: Oh, yeah, and I suppose you think you should be in charge. 
Kai, Cole, Zane, Jay, and Faith::: Team...work! Team...work! Team...work!
Kai::: It's working, guys! Just a little more.
Faith::: I can't believe this is working!
Jay::: We do have a little Faith!
Kai, Cole, Zane, Jay, and Faith::: Team...work! Team...work! Team... work! Team...
Jet Jack::: What do you think you're doing?
Jay::: Uh, nothing?They are going to eat us! 
Cole::: Ow. Ugh. Ever heard of stairs?
Faith::: I don't know if I should thank you, Jet Jack, or prepare to fight.
Kai::: Or if you're going to eat us, eat him first.He's filled with cake.
Cole:::A-Am not!
Jet Jack::: We got to talking and this Dragon Armor business has gone too far.
Daddy No Legs::: Iron Baron speaks of serving his people, but he only serves himself.
Chew Toy::: Yeah, he's kind of a jerk.
Jet Jack::: We fear with Firstbourne by his side, he will become... unforgiving. 
Jay::: Wait, wait, you're telling me all this time, while they're getting closer to the nest, you guys are arguing about whether or not to release us?
Dragon Hunters:::Mhm.
Jet Jack::: He's shown his true colors, and they are colors no one likes. I can put aside our differences if you think you five can make a difference.
Cole::: We'll follow their tracks. Let's go and stop them, before it's too late!
Dragon Hunters and ninja:::Yeah!! Yeah! Yeah!
Faith::: It's too late.
Iron Baron::: This map is indecipherable. A mountain? What mountain?! They're everywhere!
Wu::: I know where the nest is. 
Iron Baron:::The nest of Firstbourne.And in it, your freedom and my power. Come now. Our future awaits. 
Ultra Violet:::Ugh. I'm missing all the action. Will you just come and get me?! I don't know. It must've thrown me eight, maybe nine blocks. Yeah, it hurt.
Nya::: The battle wagon is just up ahead. 
Ultra Violet:::Heh heh. Green Nin-ja!
Nya::: Go. Get to the battle wagon.
Lloyd::: No. We stay together.
Nya::: Not this time. Now, go!
Ultra Violet::: Get outta my way, Water Lily!
Dareth:::If you wanna help Nya, we need the battle wagon. 
Ultra Violet::: Oh ho ho! 
Ultra Violet:::I'm impressed... It's a shame we couldn't be friends. 
Lloyd::: Nya!Are you hurt?
Nya::: My shoulder.It's pretty bad.
Lloyd::: Let's get her to the battle wagon.
Nya::: Does she ever quit?
Iron Baron::: Wait... I cannot see a cursed thing in here.Where is this Dragon Nest? 
Wu:::I believe we're in it. 
Iron Baron:::They are all asleep. Your Oni blood does not disturb them. Your Dragon blood keeps them docile. Look!It's revealing itself to you. It wants to be found.Back away! It's mine!Ah. Yes. I have it! I wear the Dragon Armor! I command you, beast, destroy him!
Wu::: You know, I've learned a lot of things since I came to this realm.
Iron Baron::: What are you babbling about?!
Wu::: My ninja taught me responsibility, confidence, a sense of humor, and to listen to the voice within. But I also learned something from you.
Iron Baron::: Argh! Stand down! Kneel before me!
Wu::: You taught me the power of lies. You didn't really think the Dragon Armor is what made Firstbourne obey my father, did you? It was because of his heart. She sensed goodness in him. What does she sense in you?
Wu::: It's okay. It's okay, now.My Father's armor... 
Arkade::: Firstbourne again!
Chew Toy::: Run for your lives!
Cole::: No, wait!
Kai::: Look!
Jay::: Woohoo! Yeah! All right! Way to go!
Jet Jack::: He's riding without chains? How is that possible?
Faith::: The Dragon Master doesn't need them.
Jay::: You did it! You actually did it!
Kai::: I always knew you had it in you!
Faith::: What about Iron Baron?
Wu::: Iron Baron's days are over. He showed his true colors and Firstbourne was not impressed.
Jet Jack::: He's gone? 
Zane::: You did well, Master.
Kai::: Or should we say... Dragon Master. 
Wu::: No, my friends. I bow to you.It was your lessons that guided me.
Cole::: Hey, I don't mean to rain on the parade, but our job isn't done.
Jay::: He's right. We've got friends waiting for us!
Kai::: And a score to settle with Garmadon.
Zane::: Do you think Firstbourne can take us all home?
Wu::: That's up to them.
Cole::: Looks like we've found our answer.
Wu::: Faith, we promised to bring you with us. You can ride with me.
Faith::: You kept your word, and that means the world to me. But I am needed here.
Kai::: I thought you hated this place.
Faith::: I did. But you taught me that with courage, things can change. And I would rather stay and fight for change in my home, than run. But I cannot do it alone.
Kai::: Faith, if you ever need help, you know you have friends in Ninjago.
Faith::: And you have friends here in the First Realm. 
Kai::: Master Wu, get us home.Yee-haw! 
Cole::: Man, I missed this.
Wu::: Everyone. Hold on!
Daddy No Legs::: Where did they go?
Faith::: Ninjago.
