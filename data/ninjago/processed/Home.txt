Kai::: My turn! Uh, it's my turn!
Cole::: Oh, you want a little more? Take this!
Jay::: Yeah? How about a little of this?
Kai::: Monkey paw to the head!
Cole::: Ninja, roll!
Jay::: Dragon punch!
Kai::: Ninja, go!
Jay::: Hey! Huh?
Cole::: Hey! What?
Zane::: Ninja, go! 
Kai::: Woah, oof.
Kai::: This roof isn't big enough for the four of us.
Cole::: Correction: This roof isn't big enough for him.
Jay::: It's like he's in his own world.I bet he can't even hear us!
Kai::: Sensei, Zane's... weird.
Wu::: What is weird? Someone who is different or someone who is different than you?
Cole::: No, Sensei. He's "weird" weird.
Cole:::Do you mind?!
Man:::Goodbye, my darling.
Kai::: Ahh! Holy bologna!
Zane::: I'm sorry. I consumed the last of the deli meat. Cheese?
Kai::: We like the guy. He's really smart. He's just...a little off sometimes.
Wu::: Zane is a brother and brothers are often different. I should know.
Kai, Jay, and Cole::: Mail! 
Postman:::Let's see. A letter from Jay's parents.Kai has a fan letter.Oh, something from Cole's father. 
Cole::: What, no package? I'm expecting something from Creatures, Beasts, and Beyond .
Postman::: No. Nothing from...uh-uh. Here it is! 
Cole::: Ha! Rocky's gonna love this!
Jay::: Hey, Zane. How come you never hear anything from your parents?
Zane::: I don't remember my parents. I've been an orphan all my life.
Kai::: You mean you've never had a home?
Wu::: The Monastery is your home now.
Cole::: Liver and toads, Rocky. Your favorite.Mm-hmm.
Rattla::: I can't believe you hypnotized one of the ninja. Does the General know?
Skales::: Of course not. He's been put under the control of Lloyd. But I plan to use it for my best interest.
Slithraa::: Everyone works while you two slack. As my second-in-command, I expect more from you, Skales.
Skales::: Yes, General. General, you know I am most loyal to you, but I must question this childish agenda. The ninja have stolen our staff yet you instruct your army to make this playhouse for Lloyd? Snakes don't belong in trees.
Slithraa::: You know better than to question my judgement, Skales. I'll pretend you didn't ask.
Lloyd::: Hey! If we plan to rule Ninjago from here, this elevator needs to have a trapped door! I want more booby traps!
Slithraa::: As you wish, young Garmadon.
Skales:::As you wish, General. 
Jay::: Hmm. Oh, I love it when it's Zane's night to cook.
Cole::: Hey. I didn't hear any complains about my duck chowder last night.
Kai::: That's because it glued our mouths shut. You really thought Jay was speechless all throughout dinner?
Jay::: Yeah. Please don't make that again.
Zane::: Dinner is served.
Zane::: What's so funny?
Nya::: Zane. You're wearing a... Even I wouldn't wear that.
Zane::: You laugh because I take steps to ensure I'm clean after cooking?
Kai::: Haha! No! We laugh because you came out wearing that ridiculous outfit!
Zane::: I guess we don't share the same sense of humor.
Cole::: Well, how about this? 
Cole::: How could you not find that funny?Ah!
Wu:::Now you are brothers.
Nya::: He looked so cute in it.
Lloyd::: If I see one girl in here. I'm gonna go ballistic.
Zane::: Thank you, my mysterious friend.
Kai::: I don't even think Zane knows where he's going.Uh, tell us again how you stumbled upon Lloyd's secret headquarters.
Zane::: I followed a bird.
Jay::: Why did you follow a bird?
Zane::: Because it danced.
Jay::: Oh...okay. Was it a cuckoo bird?
Jay::: The bird.
Zane::: Of course not. Everyone knows cuckoo birds are not indigenous to these forests.
Lloyd:::Watch it! No, bigger! Come on, we don't have all day! It's not time for a lunch break.
Cole::: Holy cannoli, Frosty was right!
Kai::: We can't let that brat and those snakes get a foothold of Ninjago. We gotta destroy that thing before it becomes operational.
Jay::: Whoa! Are you sure? It looks like a pretty cool treehouse. There's a ropes course... Ooh, a tree swing!
Cole::: Hey! Remember who's team you're on. Alright, guys. What do we do?
Kai::: It looks like the entire place is being supported by those three trees. Once those ties are severed, the whole is gonna fall like a house of cards.
Zane::: But why would one make a house of cards? Such construction would be careless.
Kai:::Oh, brother.
Cole::: Travel in shadows, boys.
Zane::: Gotcha.
Lloyd:::It's almost finished. Soon, my fortress will be complete. You! Hold up that sign for me!
Lloyd::: Booby trap!
Jay::: Ninja, go! 
Zane::: Ninja, go! 
Lloyd::: I said no ninja! Attack!
Skales::: Everyone! Retreat!
Kai::: Cole! Wait till we're off the treehouse, then cut the line. 
Skales:::You! You will obey my every command.
Cole:::I will obey your every command.
Jay::: Where's Cole?
Kai::: This whole place is coming down!
Cole:::No one goes anywhere until you deal with me!
Kai::: What's gotten into him?
Zane::: He's under their control.
Jay::: Yeah, well he better snap out of it quick because this whole place looks like it's about to go down!
Lloyd::: Don't go. We have to protect my treehouse fortress.
Skales::: Your treehouse? It's about time we did this!
Lloyd::: W-what? 
Skales::: Now, to get the staff!
Jay::: Okay, now come on. Friends don't hit friends.Ow, okay. I-I-I-I'm gonna ignore that.
Kai::: What're we supposed to do? If I use my Sword, this place will turn up into flames faster than a tinder box.
Zane::: Isn't the anti venom in the staff?
Jay::: Yeah, but the staff is back at the Monastery.
Zane::: Jay! Use your Lightning! Try to shock him out of his trance!
Jay::: Oh, sorry, Cole, but this is gonna hurt you a lot more than it's gonna hurt me.
Kai and Zane::: Jay!
Jay::: That is a serious safety hazard!
Kai::: No, Cole! Don't!
Zane::: No! No, Cole! No!
Cole::: Huh? Where-where am I? What are we doing?
Nya::: We're getting outta here because this whole place is coming down! 
Kai::: That flute!
Jay::: It cancels their powers!
Wu::: It's as old as the Serpentine themselves. But we must hurry! The Monastery is unguarded! Quickly!
Kai::: We're too late. Those snakes.
Cole::: Rocky! 
Kai::: Our home.
Zane::: Shard! Put this out!
Zane::: The training equipment, gone.
Jay::: Our video games, gone!
Wu::: They stole their staff back.
Cole::: What do we do now?
Kai::: If you hadn't followed that silly bird, none of this would've happened!
Wu::: Kai...
Jay::: No! Sensei, he's right.Because of you, my high score has been deleted!
Zane::: This is a teaching moment. We must learn from this.
Cole::: A teaching moment? What's wrong with you? Don't you get it? Everything is gone!
Wu::: Enough! We're all at fault. Zane is your brother. Apologize at once.
Kai::: I'm sorry, Zane. I... 
Jay::: Zane?
Lloyd::: Do something, General. You're still under my command, right?
Slithraa::: Enough! I am the General! You will return my staff at once!
Skales::: No.
Slithraa::: You dare challenge my command?!
Hypnobrai:::Slither Pit! Slither Pit! Slither Pit! Slither Pit!
Skales::: I guess we'll have to fight for it... in the Slither Pit!
Mezmo::: Winner gets the staff and leads the tribe! You know the rules. There are none, but in the Slither Pit, whatever I say goes. Alright, fight!
Mezmo::: Two weapons! 
Mezmo::: Side winder! 
Lloyd::: Go, General! Go!
Rattla::: He used Fang-Kwon-Do!
Lloyd:::Get up! Get up!
Mezmo::: We have a winner!
Hypnobrai:::Skales! Skales! Skales! Skales! Skales! Skales! Skales! Skales!
Skales::: You will be loyal to me now!
Slithraa::: I will do as you command.
Skales:::You! Leave and never return! 
Kai::: Wh-what are we eating again?
Cole::: Mud newt. Not bad for something that lives underground.
Jay:::What?Yeah! A new high s-sc-score!
Wu::: Remember, we must be thankful for what we still have.
Cole::: What do we have? Our home is gone.
Kai::: You know, I don't miss our home. What I really miss is Zane.
Jay::: Yeah. I miss Zane.
Nya::: Zane?
Jay::: Yeah, Zane. You know. White Ninja. The smart, strange one.
Nya::: No.Zane!
All::: Zane!
Jay:::Zane. We're so sorry for everything we've said. We're a team and that means we're all responsible.
Zane::: You don't need to apologize to me.
Kai::: But what about all those awful things we said? Isn't that why you left?
Zane::: Of course not. I saw the Falcon again and I followed him.
Cole::: That's our Zane.
Nya::: We're happy to have you back.
Zane::: Why? Is it my turn to make dinner?
Wu::: Yes, Zane. We would love for you to make dinner.
Zane::: But I already made it. Come. I want to show you what I've found. I think you will all be pleased.
Zane::: I can't explain it, but I feel a strange connection with the Falcon. I think he's trying to help show us the path we need to take.
Zane::: Our new home.
Jay::: Do I smell pie?
Zane::: Cobbler berry. Oh, and I made myrtle berry and apple andâ€”
Wu::: I'm proud of you, Zane. One day, I promise. We will find your family.
Zane::: But I've already found them.
Wu::: I feel there's more to you than meets the eye. There's something special about you, Zane.
Zane::: Sensei, will I become the Green Ninja?
Wu::: It's too early to tell, but if it's in your path, you'll know. Come now. It would be a shame to let them to eat all that pie.
