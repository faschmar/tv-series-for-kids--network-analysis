Zane::: If the records are correct, this is Dyer's childhood home. His parents still live here.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Let us hope they will be willing to help us.
Zane::: Their son is a dangerous criminal known as Unagami. It is their civic duty to provide whatever assistance they can.
Wu::: Yes, but we have to handle it delicately, Zane.
Zane::: As you wish.
Mrs. Dyer::: Hello. Can I help you?
Wu::: Hello. We're looking for your son, Milton Dyer.
Mrs. Dyer::: You know my son?
Zane::: Not exactly. A video game he created a long time ago is causing problems, and we need to find him.
Mrs. Dyer::: Oh of course, this is about those silly little games. Here I was hoping you were his friends.
P.I.X.A.L.::: So you don't where he is either?
Mrs. Dyer::: He won't talk to us. But maybe something in here can give you a clue to his whereabouts.We just wanted the best for him. Focus on school, prepare for a career. We had no idea video games could be a real career.And when it all went bad with that final game, we haven't seen Milton since...
Zane::: Who is this with him?
Mrs. Dyer::: One of his friends. What was his name? I can't remember. If you find my son, you tell him we miss him.Tell him to come home.
Wu::: Of course.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Did he build this?
Mrs. Dyer::: Yes. He was always building models to use in his games.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Thank you for your time, Mrs. Dyer. 
Lloyd::: What's that?
Jay::: Only the most dangerous race in Prime Empire. The track is lethal, the turns are deadly, and the other drivers are wild!
Cole::: We're here to sign up for the Speedway Five-Billion.
Kai::: Uh, maybe we should start smaller. Do you have a Speedway Five-Hundred?
Admin Droid::: No.
Admin Droid::: Wonderful. The entry fee will be deducted from your account.
Lloyd::: How much is it?
Admin Droid::: Two hundred credits each. You must register as a team of five, which means you need a total of one thousand credits.
Lloyd::: One thousand? Wow. Okay, let's pool our money. I've got, uh, one sixty.
Nya::: I've got one ninety-eight.
Cole::: One fifty-three.
Jay::: A hundred and sixty.
Kai::: Twelve?
Jay::: Twelve? How do you only have twelve?
Cole::: What did you spend your credits on?
Kai::: This sick new Avatar?Eh? Eh? What do you think?
Jay::: That looks AWESOME! Can I have one?
Nya::: No, Jay! Look, guys, we're three hundred and seventeen credits short now. We gotta find a way to come up with that money before - oh no.We can't afford to upgrade weapons. We need every credit we've got!
Jay::: Sorry, guys. Gotta upgrade.
Male automated voice::: Upgrade for one hundred credits.
Jay::: Better to be poor and alive! 
Lloyd::: Great. Now we need four hundred and seventeen credits. Where are we supposed to get that kind of money?
Kai::: Way to go, Jay!
Jay::: Hey! You're the one with the fancy new avatar!
Lloyd::: There's gotta be a way!
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Enter the Terra Technica dance-off! One night only. Winners receive admiration, acclaim, and five hundred credits.
Jay::: Maybe we can do some quests or something, earn some extra credits. Hey, here's one where we can fight some ogre. That could be fun.
Cole::: Yeah, but it's only twenty credits.
Lloyd::: And a good chance of getting crushed. No thanks.
Kai::: Well, what else can we do?
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Competitive dancing! It's fun, and you can't get hurt! Sure beats fighting endless ogres for credits!
Lloyd::: Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?
Cole::: Oh, this is gonna be a disaster! Jay couldn't dance his way out of a paper bag!
Kai::: Ugh, I can't watch. Tell me what happens.
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Ladies and gentlemen, and creatures of all kinds, welcome to Terra Technica's dance-off! Five teams competing for admiration, acclaim, and five hundred credits! Let the dance-off begin!Good! Okay! Nice one! Great!

Kai::: What? What's happening? Is it over?
Lloyd::: Since when can Jay dance?
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Great! Okay! Good! Nice one! Good! Perfect!
Jay::: Wow. They're really good! Maybe this wasn't such a great idea.
Nya::: They're got sequins and poise. But we've got something they don't.
Jay::: Uh, Superstar Rockin' Jay?
Nya::: Chemistry. Now dance!
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Perfect! Nice one!
Female Dancer:::Get near my line, and you lose a toe.
Jay::: Uh ... heh.
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Great! Perfect combo!
Lloyd::: They must have been taking dancing lessons together in secret.
Kai::: If I had to take dancing lessons, I'd keep it a secret too. But I gotta say, they look good out there.
Cole::: They look great! Keep those shoulders back! Find your center!
Dance-Bot Announcer::: And now, the tango! Good!Oh no!
Cole::: Lead with your hips!And one, and two, one and two.
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Good!Uh oh! Whoops-a-daisy! Great!Ouch, that's gonna sting! Good! Okay! Crazy combo! Great! Okay! 
Nya::: Ow!
Dance-Bot Announcer::: C-C-C-C-Combo breaker! Good!
Nya::: They're cheating their way to victory!
Lloyd::: Uh oh. Red Visors are here.
Kai::: And they're too late to enter the competition, so I'm thinking they're here for us.
Cole::: Nya and Jay have three minutes left. We've got to keep those Red Visors from ruining the competition! 
Jay::: This would be a great time to do the running man!
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Okay. Nice one! Combo bonus! Great! There seems to be an added level of difficulty in our final challenge. You're on fire! Nice one. Crazy combo!
Cole::: It's time. Triple Tiger Sashay!Nobody puts Cole in a corner.
Dance-Bot Announcer::: We're down to the home stretch. Thirty seconds on the clock! Now's the time to prove yourselves, folks! Let's see what you've got!
Jay::: We've got to do something big!
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Great!
Nya::: Catch me!
Jay::: Wait! No, we've never done that move!
Nya::: I trust you!
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Perfect! Insane combo!
Jay::: I love you!
Dance-Bot Announcer::: Perfect score!We have our champions! Earning admiration, acclaim, and of course, five hundred credits!
Nya::: We're back, mister! With just enough for the entry fee.
Admin Droid::: Congratulations. You're in the race. What is your team name?
Jay::: Oh, oh! I know! I've got the perfect name! "The Fast Chickens"!
Nya:::Jay.
Jay::: What? Chickens are fast and dangerous!
Admin Droid::: Fine. Fast Chickens. Have your vehicles at the starting line at dawn.
Lloyd::: You mean, vehicles aren't included?
Admin Droid::: Included? Ha. Ha. Ha. What kind of a race do you think this is? You bring your own vehicles. 
Jay::: This isn't over yet! Come on!
Nya::: Where are we going?
Jay::: I know a place we might be able to get some wheels. 
Red Visor::: Sir, we just missed them. They have entered the race.
Unagami::: If they're after vehicles, there's only one person who can help them. Find the one called Scott.
