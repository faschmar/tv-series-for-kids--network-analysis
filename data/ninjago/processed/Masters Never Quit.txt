Plundar::: I thought we lost this thing!
Korgran::: Plundar think wrong!
Cole::: No more thinking. Just run!Everyone, into the carts!
Vania::: Are you sure these still work?
Wu::: I am forced to agree with the Princess, this looks rather old!
Cole::: Trust me, it'll work! Korgran, gimmie a hand! 
Plundar::: Time to go! All aboard! 
Cole::: I told you it would work! Whoo! That's what you call a good idea!
Vania::: We're going too fast!
Wu::: Hold on!
Cole:::On that side! Quick! Oh, what kind of person would build a track like this?
Fungus::: I think I'm going to be sick.
Cole:::Whew. That was close. 
Korgran::: Down!
Cole::: Uh-oh.
Vania::: What, uh oh? 
Cole::: See? Another good idea.
Wu::: Is everyone alright?
Korgran::: Ugh. Korgran head hurt.
Plundar::: My whole body hurts.
Fungus::: Where are we?
Wu::: Cole? What is it?
Cole::: I don't know. I have a strange feeling about this place. 
Wu::: Hmm.
Cole::: What is it?
Wu::: It is the Old Tongue. The language in which my oldest scrolls are written.
Fungus::: What does it say?
Wu::: There's something about ... the heart of the mountain? "Let pass through here, into this refuge and sanctuary. Only those who are one with the Earth." Hmm, I wonder.
Korgran::: What means that?
Wu::: "The Masters of Earth. Some believe it was hidden in the mountains of Shintaro. But it has never been found.
Vania::: Oh, I know this story! It's in one of my books. Famous Places That I Will Find Before Anyone Else, by Clutch Powers.
Plundar::: What's inside? Treasure? Loot?
Wu::: Something even more precious.
Plundar::: Gemstones!
Wu::: The teachings of the "Spinjitzu Burst."
Fungus::: The what?
Wu::: It's a powerful force. Only an Elemental Master surrounded by his element can achieve it, it's mentioned in some of the earliest teachings of mother sought to learn the Burst... but she never did.
Cole::: There's so much I never knew about her.
Plundar::: How do you open it?
Fungus::: Korgran, a little help. 
Wu::: If the legend is true, the doors will open only for those who are one with the Earth. An Earth Elemental.
Korgran::: It would be nice to tell Korgran before.
Fungus::: Whoa. Such beauty.
Wu::: We are looking upon something that few have ever seen.
Vania:::Who is it?
Wu::: Cole's mother, Lilly.
Fungus:::Look. Look at this!
Korgran::: What is it?
Wu::: A mech. But unlike any mech I've ever seen. It appears to be made of stone?
Fungus::: Perhaps the builders of this place used it to build the Temple.
Vania::: Do you think it still works?
Plundar:::There's no controls in this thing. Just a bunch of weird crystals. And this junk.
Cole:::"This statue was carved with love and gratitude by Geckle and Munce craftsmen."
Wu::: Cole. 
Cole::: Whoa. I guess she did learn how to do it.
Vania::: What's that light shining out of her?
Wu::: Elemental energy. Power. The power of the Earth itself.
Vania:::Cole! You have to try it!
Cole::: Me? I - I - I can't. I don't know how!
Vania::: But you're an Earth Elemental. If you could learn the Spinjitzu Burst, you could use it against my father and free all those poor creatures working in the mines.
Cole::: We don't even know for sure if my mother could do the Burst. What if it was the Blades of Deliverance?
Wu::: But we don't have the Blades, Cole. The Burst is our only chance. You have to try.
Cole::: Okay. Fine. But I'm not making any promises. Okay. Let's get this Spinjitzu Burst started.What do I do?
Wu::: You're asking me? I don't know.
Cole::: You're the Master.
Wu::: I know nothing of this kind of Spinjitzu. This is known only to Earth Elementals. You must open your mind. You must discover the truth within you.
Korgran::: Mm. Nothing is happen.
Wu::: Do you feel anything?
Cole::: Nothing.
Korgran::: Still nothing is happen.
Plundar::: No kidding.
Cole::: You guys mind?That wasn't the Burst, was it?
Wu::: No.
Cole::: Come on, you stupid mountain! Do something! Do something!Was that me?
Plundar::: Whatever it was, it shook the whole mountain!
Korgran::: Sound like thunder!
Fungus::: I must look into this. 
Cole::: What's he doing?
Korgran::: Fungus magic.
Plundar::: He's making the pictures again.
Fungus::: I-It is not pictures. It is far-sight. I have discovered a special concoction of lichen and moss which reveal things that are happening far away. Observe! 
Cole::: Hey!
Vania::: It's the other ninja!
Wu::: Where are they? What's happened to them?
Fungus::: Quiet. Watch.
Plundar::: They're in trouble!
Korgran::: They fight dragon?
Fungus::: It must be Grief-Bringer.
Cole::: Grief-Bringer? The dragon from the picture with my mom?We have to do something! We have to help!
Wu::: Against something so powerful, only the Spinjitzu Burst can prevail.
Cole::: Well, I can't do that! Ugh. Our friends are in trouble, and we're wasting time, stuck here in this - this useless temple! Argh!
Vania::: Master Wu? I hope you will forgive me saying this, but instead of standing around doing nothing, maybe you should be helping Cole.
Wu::: Excuse me?
Vania::: Cole needs you. And you're not doing anything to help.
Wu::: Cole is no longer a student! He is an accomplished ninja and an Elemental Master. He has not needed me in a long time.
Vania::: That's not how it looks to me.
Wu::: Hmm.On your feet, Cole.
Cole::: What's the point?
Wu::: We have work to do.
Cole::: I can't do it, Master Wu. I'm not my mother! I can't do the Burst, so unless you know how -
Wu::: I do not.
Cole::: Then we have to find some other way.
Wu:::Vania is right.
Cole::: Vania?
Wu::: I have neglected my duties. What has been the principal lesson of all my teachings? I'm waiting.
Cole::: Ninja never quit.
Wu::: Exactly. Ninja never quit. And from this moment on, neither do Masters. They would never quit on us and we will never quit on them. Burst or not, we have a dragon to face!
