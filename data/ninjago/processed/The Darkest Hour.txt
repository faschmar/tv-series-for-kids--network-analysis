Murtessa::: It was! It's back. Skull Sorcerer must have reanimated it.
Kai::: What?
Gulch::: The—the Strong-Cave. It's our. . .our only hope!
Kai::: Oh, finally, some good news. Guys—
Gulch:::Shh! Don't say it out loud! Do you want the Munce to hear?
Kai::: Yeah, that's the point, Gulch! If we leave them out here, they'll get chewed up by that thing! Follow us, everyone!
Skull Sorcerer::: Bring it all down!After them. All of you!
Gulch::: Cha. . .Chancellor Kai. . . you must order the cave sealed!
Kai::: I have to actually say that? Okay, seal the cave! Now! 
Geckle::: It's stuck!
Nya::: Forget the wheel! Cut the chain!
Lloyd::: They're not gonna get shut in time.
Jay::: Then we better buy them some time!
Lloyd::: You—
Jay::: —shall—
Kai::: —not—
Zane::: —be granted permission to traverse beyond this point. 
Lloyd, Jay, Kai, and Zane::: Ninja, go! 
Kai:::Haha!Look out!
Murtessa:::It's coming down!
Nya::: Guys! Get in here!
Lloyd::: Run! 
Kai::: Hopefully we're safe for now.
Gulch::: Are you kidding? We are not safe! The enemy is among us. You let them into our cave!
Jay::: What? Where?
Gulch::: The Munce! 
Kai::: You're doing this now?
Lloyd::: Are you kidding?
Kai::: Come on!
Gulch::: Hide your possessions, Geckles, before the Munce steal them! Like they stole the Ivory Blade of Deliverance!
Murtessa::: You stole blade! The blade of Milly!
Gulch::: It's Gilly, you glop-mouthed—
Murtessa::: Milly is our legend, you legend stealing stealer-of-legends! Munce, look through cave for our blade, that Geckle stole from us! Finding it would make being in prison here worth it!
Gulch::: Oh, you can leave any time!
Murtessa::: Oh? There is other way out of this cave?
Gulch::: Of course not! Do you even understand the point of a strong-cave?
Skull Sorcerer::: Geckles! Munce! Hear me! I offer you a chance! And one chance only! Send out the ninja and I will spare your lives. I will show you mercy.
Hazza D'ur::: Mercy! Mercy!
Skull Sorcerer::: Send them out and you will be allowed to return to work in the mines. All shall be as it was, a time of peace and hard work. So swears the Skull Sorcerer.
Murtessa:::Never!
Gulch:::No way!
Murtessa::: I am talking, Geckle!
Gulch::: We both started talking at the same time!
Murtessa::: No, I said the "Ne" in "Never" before you open mouth.
Skull Sorcerer::: All of you—
Gulch::: All right, who was watching? Did anyone see who opened their mouth first?
Skull Sorcerer::: Here me—
Nya::: Would one of you just respond?
Murtessa::: Munce will never serve Skull Sorcerer!
Gulch::: As much as it pains me to agree with a Munce, neither will the Geckles!
Skull Sorcerer::: So be it. Grief-Bringer, my skeletons, destroy them!
Hazza D'ur:::Destruction! Devastation!
Kai::: It's cracking!You said this strong-cave could withstand the Grief-Bringer!
Gulch::: Well, we thought it could, but it's never been tested against the resurrected-skeleton-dragon and an army of evil-skeletons. Without Gilly, all is lost.
Nya:::Zane! Can you scan this?
Zane::: There's a space behind this wall of rocks. Possibly a previously covered-up exit.
Nya::: Listen up! There's an opening behind this rock wall! We're not sure, but it could be a way out. If we're going to bring down this wall, we need everyone's help. And by everyone, I mean everyone! 
Gulch::: Look! There's something back here!
Murtessa::: He's right! A chamber!
Nya::: Look at them. They're working together. Side by side.
Lloyd::: I never thought I'd see that.
Kai:::Huh? No. It's a dead-end.
Murtessa::: Hmm. What we do?
Gulch::: There's no other way out.
Jay::: No. They'll get through any minute.
Gulch::: I—I am sorry. I was wrong to lead you all here.
Murtessa::: Mm. You gave us shelter. I too am sorry.
Gulch::: For what?
Murtessa::: You Geckles value family, like Munce. You work hard, like Munce. You honor Milly, like Munce. Is possible . . . we are not so different?
Gulch::: I . . . was a fool. I saw only the things that made us different, not the things we had in common.
Murtessa::: We were all foolish.
Gulch::: We have a common enemy. Let us stand together and face him as allies.
Murtessa::: Agreed. Let us put aside differences and face him together.
Kai:::This is so beautiful. Two peoples, coming together in peace, love, and harmony.
Gulch::: No, we are not at peace.
Kai::: But—I—I thought—
Gulch::: It must be declared, formally. By you! You are the Chancellor.
Kai::: Oh, uh, okay. Uh, then, by the power vested in me as Geckle Chancellor, I hereby declare peace with the Munce. 
Nya::: By my power as Queen, I declare peace with the Geckles.
Murtessa::: Now, we are at peace.
Lloyd::: Wait! We'll do it! We'll take your deal!
Murtessa, Gulch, and the ninja::: What?
Lloyd::: Your offer. We turn ourselves in, you let them all go, but not back to the mines. You let them free. If you swear to that, we will surrender without a fight.
Skull Sorcerer::: Hmm. Agreed. 
Gulch::: Once again, outsiders have risked everything to save us.
Murtessa::: Now, leave us in peace, as you promised!
Skull Sorcerer::: Oh, that. You didn't really believe that, did you? 
Hazza D'ur::: Fools! Fools!
