Kai::: Hey, Master. What's up?
Wu:::Spinjitzu...
Kai::: Hey, Jay. What's up? Huh?
Zane::: He appears to have gone into some meditative trance. Or possibly spontaneous self hibernation.
Kai::: Nah. He's probably just fantasizing about that.Our Elemental vehicles. Created from our Golden Weapons. Remember those, Zane?
Zane::: I don't need to remember. I can recall an enhanced visual augmentation from my data log.
Kai::: Hey, we didn't look like that back then.
Zane::: I told you, it was an enhanced visual augmentation.
Kai::: Whatever.
Past Spitta::: Give me that!
Past Kai::: Venomari. Careful, Zane. They spit bad stuff.
Past Spitta:::Hey, where do you think you're going? Get back here!
Past Zane::: You! Get back here!
Past Kai::: No fear, folks! The Fire Brigadeâ€”Whoa!Zane! A little help? Whoa!
Past Zane::: Hey, Kai!
Past Kai::: Huh?
Past Zane::: When is a Venomari truly defeated? When a Nindroid rolls......Snake ice!How many guys are there?
Venomari Warrors::: Yah! 
Past Zane::: Ah-uh!
Past Kai::: Be right with you, Zane! Ninja, go!Hey, Zane. Which bird can swim, dive, and goes "quack"? 
Past Zane::: Huh?
Past Kai:::Duck! 
Past Zane::: Thank you, thank you. And now for our encore. 
Kai::: Wait a minute, you never did that.
Zane::: That is another recent upgrade of mine: selective memory. It can be quite handy, you know.
Kai::: Ugh, whatever. Let's get something to eat. You coming, Jay? Jay? Jay! Ugh. Whatever.
