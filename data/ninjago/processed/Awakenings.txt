Lloyd::: It's time we finished this, Zane, once and for all.
Ice Emperor::: My name is not Zane!
Lloyd::: Yes, it is!And you're going to remember it, if I have to knock it into your thick Nindroid skull!
Akita::: You... know the Emperor!
Lloyd::: He's not an Emperor. He's my friend. He's the one I'm here to rescue. It's hard to explain, but I can't let you hurt him, Akita.
Akita:::My will is not yours to command!
Lloyd:::Akita, no! This isn't the way! You're letting your anger control you!
Akita::: Stand aside, Lloyd. Or fall with him!
Lloyd::: I won't let you hurt Zane! He's my—Gah! 
Ice Emperor::: There is no Zane! 
Lloyd::: No! 
Vex::: Well, well, well...Lock this traitor in the dungeon and throw the animal in with him. The rest of you, follow me! 
Cole::: I hope P.I.X.A.L. wasn't expecting us to bring the Bounty back in one piece or anything.
Kai::: What?
Cole::: Are you sure?
Jay::: The Emperor must be an Elemental Master of Ice, just like Zane! What are the odds?
Nya::: Oh, no! How could I be so foolish?
Jay::: What?
Nya::: The Emperor. What if he's not an Ice Elemental like Zane? What if he is Zane?
Cole::: What?!
Kai::: Zane would never hurt anyone.
Nya::: Not in his normal state, no.But he was holding the Scroll of Forbidden Spinjitzu when Aspheera blasted him into the Never-Realm!
Cole::: Which Master Wu said would corrupt anyone whoever held it.
Jay::: What about the time difference? How do you explain that?
Nya::: I can't, but it's the only thing that adds up. Somehow, Zane is the Ice Emperor.
Kai::: We gotta warn Lloyd before he g—RUN!Ahhh! Ungh!
Nya::: Kai! 
Jay::: Nya, look out! 
Cole:::Hunh-yah! 
Nya::: Kai, say something. 
Past Sorla::: You must only remember who you are.
Nya::: I am Nya, Master of Water. I am Nya, Master of Water. I am Nya, Master of Water! And you will obey! 
Jay::: Nya! You did it!
Cole::: Haha! I knew you could do it! 
Nya::: I'm sorry. I tried.
Kai::: No.No.No MORE! 
Nya::: Your powers, Kai! They're back!
Jay::: Haha! Better late than never!
Cole::: Come on! Let's get to Zane and Lloyd! 
Lloyd:::Wake up, Zane! 
Ice Emperor:::Yarh! 
Akita::: Lloyd!AHHH—
Lloyd::: No! Akita. Zane. Please.
Ice Emperor::: I told you. There is no Zane!
Vex::: Do it, Master. Finish it!
Lloyd::: Zane. 
Vex::: I'll do it.Hmm, hmm. Some savior you turned out to be. You couldn't defeat the Emperor. You couldn't protect your friends.
Ice Emperor::: "Protect"?
Vex::: You couldn't even protect yourself.
Ice Emperor::: Protect those who cannot protect themselves.Vex!Don't!Hoi-yah! 
Zane:::Lloyd!
Lloyd::: I knew you'd remember. I knew it!
Zane::: Thank you, Lloyd.Where are the others?
Vex:::Roar-rgh! 
Akita:::Kataru!
Kataru:::Akita!
Nya::: Zane!
Kai::: Lloyd! 
Akita:::So ended, the reign of the Ice Emperor. I was reunited with my brother, Kataru.And the King was restored to his throne.
Warriors:::Yeah!
Akita:::His people and my people were released from their curse.Vex the Formless was banished from our lands.And peace returned to the Never-Realm.After many days, the time at last came when the ninja hoped to return to their own realm.But this, was not so simple.
Sorla:::I have consulted the spirits of the Hearth Fire and I have learned of this Ninjago. It is far from here. The leaves of the Traveler's Tree will not have the strength to bear you home.
Cole::: But I-I can get more!Right, Krag?You can help me up back the mountain and-and we can—
Sorla::: It is no use. No amount of leaves will suffice. If we only had something more portent.
Cole:::Sorla, what about this? 
Ninja:::Haha! Yeah!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Master Wu, come quickly! 
Wu:::What is it?It's them! They're back!Nya! Kai! Zane!
Zane::: Master Wu! It is good to see you!
Wu:::You too, Zane! You too!
P.I.X.A.L.:::Zane!
Zane::: Whoa-ah! 
Wu::: Welcome home, all of you.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Where are Cole and Lloyd? 
Cole::: Well, so long, buddy.Alright, bring it, buddy. Give Cole a hug.Whoa! Okay, okay. Take it easy! 
Lloyd:::Well, I guess this is— 
Sorla::: Lloyd, you must hurry. The portal is closing. 
Lloyd::: Take care of yourself.
Akita::: You too. 
Kataru::: Come, little sister. I know what will cheer you up. 
Akita::: As for Lloyd, my brother thinks I will never see him again. But I think he is wrong."Never" is a very long time.
