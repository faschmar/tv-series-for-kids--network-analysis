Maya::: Rise and shine, sleepyhead! It's 6 A.M.! Early ninja gets the worm!Oh, my! Would you look at this mess. Dear, dear, dear. Okay, let's tidy this place up. A messy room makes for a messy ninja, Nya, and we are not messy ninjas. Spears belong in their racks, shurikens and throwing stars belong in the shuriken and throwing star bin -
Nya::: Make it stop.
Maya::: Bladed weapons don't just get stabbed into a wall, they actually have a place! And chickens do not belong indoors!Now this place is starting to look like something. Are you still lying there? Come on, up up up, sleepyhead. I find the best way to start the day and chase away those sleepies is with a few jumping jacks! Ready set go! One - and - two - and - one - and - two - and - 
Nya::: Am I having a nightmare, or is this really happening?
Nya::: You made breakfast?
Maya::: Of course I made breakfast! It's the most important meal of the day! If we're going to get you back in shape and fix your life, you're gonna need your strength.
Nya::: My life does not need fixing, Mother.
Maya::: That's not what your brother says. He says your powers are going haywire and you can't control master of water, but never fear! We'll figure it out together.
Nya::: Um, why is the bacon green?
Maya::: That's not bacon, silly. It's seaweed.
Nya::: Seaweed?
Maya::: Goes great with tofu pancakes!
Nya:::Ew. Yeah, no.
Maya::: And it will get you in tune with your element. Now eat up. Gobble gobble!
Nya::: No way am I eat- 
Maya::: Now for some basics. Assume water stance.No, no, no. Your form is terrible, dear. Not like that, like this!Uh-uh. Arms up.Not quite.Back straight, plant your legs, hands up, eyes fixed, breathe in and out, in and out. Not like a Mino, dear, just like a person.
Nya::: Okay, that's it. I can't do this! My water stance is fine, Mom!
Maya::: Well, if it was fine, you wouldn't be having all the problems you're having, dear.
Nya::: I'm not having problems. It was a one-time mistake, Mom. It won't happen again! 
Nya::: But there has to be something you can do!
Wu::: To accomplish what?
Nya::: To get her to leave! She's driving me bonkers. Can't you tell her that you found a solution? That we don't need her help anymore?
Wu::: I have been searching, Nya, but there's surprisingly little information on the elemental power of water. Your mother may be our best option.
Misako::: She just wants to help, Nya. She's been gone a long time. She wants to be your mother, and take care of you.
Nya:::I know, but she's taking over. She's doing everything. She's got all this advice, all these sayings, she fed me bacon made out of seaweed!
Wu::: Perhaps you should talk to your brother. Kai might be able to help.
Nya::: Kai? Kai wouldn't understand. He probably likes being waited on. I bet he loves being treated like a baby.
Misako::: I'm sure that's not true. Kai's a grown man. Talk to your brother.
Kai::: Oh, I got the powerup. Get ready, Dad.
Ray::: Roger that!
Nya::: Hey -
Ray and Kai::: Fiya! 
Kai::: Scorcher!
Nya::: Can I talk to -
Ray::: Oh, uh, hi Nya. We're about to break a new record. Nice move, Kai!
Kai::: Thanks, Dad! Not as good as you, though.
Ray::: Ah, thanks, son.
Nya::: Kai, can I talk to you for a sec?
Kai::: Oh, here comes the big boss! Hit him with all you've got!
Ray::: Oh, take that, you big oaf!
Maya::: I made sandwiches!
Kai::: Pause! Ham and cheese sandwiches with crispy bacon?
Maya::: Oh, you bet!
Kai::: Oh thanks, Mommy! You're the best!Mm, bacon is the best too!
Cole::: Okay, think I've fixed it. Try the video feed.
Lloyd::: That did the trick.
Nya::: Can I help?
Lloyd::: Oh, thanks, Nya, but we're basically done.
Nya::: Where are P.I.X.A.L. and Zane?
Cole:::Uh, they, um, kind of ... went on a mission.
Nya::: Mission? Why didn't they tell me?
Lloyd:::They thought it might be better to ... handle it on their own.
Nya::: Why?
Cole::: It ... was a water rescue.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I cannot help but feel a little badly that we did not include Nya on this mission.
Zane::: I have similar misgivings, but in her current state, Nya would only present a danger.
P.I.X.A.L.::: As does that. 
Woman::: Help, help! Over here!
Man::: We're going down!
Zane::: I do not understand. Octopuses are peaceful creatures who seldom venture to the surface.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I will attempt to calm it down and- something has clearly agitated it.
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L., are you okay?
P.I.X.A.L.::: I am fine. Please attend to the sailors while I attempt to reason with the creature.
Zane::: Affirmative. 
P.I.X.A.L.::: Please release me before I am forced to resort to physical measures. I repeat, please -
Automated Warning Voice::: Danger. Danger. 
P.I.X.A.L.::: What was that? 
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L.. P.I.X.A.L., do you copy? 
Nya::: You've got to be kidding me. 
Jay::: What is up with the plumbing today?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Please release me, before I am forced to resort to physical measures. I repeat, please - 
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L., if you can hear me, eject from the mech. I'm sending down a line. 
P.I.X.A.L.::: Zane! Zane, do you copy? I have lost all power.
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L., come in!P.I.X.A.L., if you can hear me, reboot your primary ignition system. Reboot primary ignition!
P.I.X.A.L.::: Hmm, this is somewhat troubling.
Automated Warning Voice::: Danger. Approaching crush depth. Danger. Crush depth. Hull integrity failure in ten seconds. Nine. Eight.
P.I.X.A.L.::: Nya taught me a peculiar method in situations like this, which sometimes proves effective. I believe it goes like this.That's better.
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L., come in. Can you hear me? P.I.X.A.L.!
P.I.X.A.L.::: I have decided to look into how to pressurize our vehicles for better depth deployment.
Zane:::There you are. I was worried.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I am worried too, Zane. What was that?
Zane::: Some kind of energy signal or pulse. I am attempting to triangulate its source. The pulse, whatever it was, appears to originate from out at sea.
P.I.X.A.L.::: From the surface?
Zane::: No, deep below the surface. If I am not mistaken, a trench of some kind.
P.I.X.A.L.::: The energy pulse is what affected that creature. I fear it may also be affecting Nya's powers.
Zane:::If you are correct, we must warn the others.
Nya::: I'm ... I'm sorry for all the trouble. I don't know what's going on with me, but all of this is my fault.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I do not believe that is true.
Wu::: What do you mean?
P.I.X.A.L.::: Zane and I believe that an unexplained energy signal from the deep ocean is responsible for the fluctuations in your powers.
Lloyd::: What energy signal?
Zane::: A pulse, of unknown origins.
P.I.X.A.L.::: It appears to originate here, in the Tartarus Trench. 
Zane::: It is the deepest known point in the ocean.
Wu::: Didn't you build a submersible capable of deep sea exploration a number of years ago?
P.I.X.A.L.::: I did, the Hydro Bounty. But it was never fully tested.
Wu::: It's about to be. You're going diving.
