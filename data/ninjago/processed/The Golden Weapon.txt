Wu::: Stop!
Cole, Jay and Zane::: Yes, Sensei.
Kai:::Wait a minute, they're your students too?This was my final test, wasn't i-?
Jay::: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You never said anything about a fourth. It's always three. Three Blind Mice. Three Musketeers. Three—
Cole::: Uh, what he's trying to say, Sensei Wu, is that three of us have trained together. We're solid.
Kai::: Didn't look so solid to me.
Zane::: Master, what is the meaning of this?
Wu::: Each of you have been chosen. Each in tune with elemental properties. But first, ninja, Go!
Kai::: Whoa!
Cole::: How'd he do that?!
Jay:::Whoa! Look what color I am!
Cole::: Wait a minute, I'm still black.
Wu::: Kai, Master of Fire. It burns bright in you. Jay is blue, Master of Lightning.
Jay::: Heh, that's not all I'm the master of. I do a little inventing. A dabble in model building. A touch of cooking. A little poetry.
Cole:::More like "Mouth of Lightning".
Wu::: Black Ninja is Cole, solid as rock, Master of Earth.
Cole:::Nice to meet you, kid. I got your back, and for the record, there ain't nothing in this world I'm afraid of.
Zane::: Except for dragons.
Cole:::Dragons aren't from this world, Zane. I said in this world.
Wu::: And White Ninja is Zane, Master of sixth sense. 
Kai::: I sense this one takes things a little too seriously.
Zane::: You too have the gift?
Jay:::He's just making a joke, Zane. Remember what we talked about? Your sense of humor? Huh?
Zane::: Yes, it was a joke. Haha. 
Wu::: Pay attention! You four are the chosen ones who will protect the Four Weapons of Spinjitzu... from Lord Garmadon.
Kai::: But what about my sister?!
Jay:::We're saving a girl? Is she hot?
Cole::: Jay...
Jay::: I-I just wanna know what we're getting ourselves into. Does she like blue?
Kai::: Back off!
Wu::: When we find the weapons, we will find your sister. It is time! We must go to the first weapon!
Cole::: Whoa! Hold on a minute. You said you were gonna teach us Spinjitzu.
Wu::: Spinjitzu is inside each and every one of you, but it will only be unlocked when the key is ready to be found.Come! My feet are tired. We will take the horse carriage.
Cole::: Great.
Jay::: Now we have to find the key?
Cole::: Yeah, I'm feeling like he's taking us for a ride.
Kai::: Well, if it means finding my sister, then sign me up.
Jay:::"Sign me up". Way to go, spark plug.
Zane::: I sense this is some strange form of team-building.
Cole::: Just keep pulling. We have a long way to go.
Kai::: So, where did Sensei find you three?
Cole::: Let's just say if it wasn't for Sensei Wu, I don't think we'd ever been seen together. I was testing my limits. 
Jay::: I was testing my invention. 
Zane::: And I was testing myself. 
Kai::: You're right, if it weren't for Sensei, none of us would—
Wu::: Shh... Stop!The Caves of Despair. Samukai must be close to unearthing the Scythe of Quakes. Remember, do not use the weapon. For its power—
Jay::: Yeah, yeah, yeah! It's too much for us mortals. Alright, guys. Let's chop-socky this lemonade stand! Cole, you got the plan?
Cole::: Sure do. First, we lower ourselves down the ledge. And then... ... where's Kai?
Jay:::Let's go!
Kai:::The map!
Nuckal::: Oh, oh, oh, oh. I found something!
Kruncha:::That's another rock, you bonehead!
Nuckal::: But it's shaped like a doughnut! I wonder what it tastes like. 
Jay:::What's the matter with you?
Kai::: Shh.
Jay:::It's upside-down. They're digging at the wrong spot.
Zane::: The Golden Weapon is near. 
Kai:::There's no time to waste. 
Jay::: What is it with that guy? Always in a rush!
Cole::: Hey! Before you race off again, you need to remember that we're a team.
Kai::: Yeah, whatever.
Jay:::Wow! That is so cool! 
Cole:::Not so loud.
Jay::: Come on. Don't be paranoid. We're totally on the opposite side of the caves.
Cole::: Zip it, okay?Now that we got the Scythe, let's sneak out while those boneheads are still busy.
Cole::: Alright, team. Everyone stick together. The way out is right around the corner.
Jay:::Two points!
Zane::: Kai! Throw it here! 
Cole::: Going long! 
Kai::: There's too many of them!
Jay::: Let me handle that.
Jay::: Hey, guys! It's just like the training course! Over the planks! Dodge the sword! Here comes the dummy! Cha-Ching!
Kai:::Spinjitzu! Jay! What's the key?!
Jay::: I'm just going through the motions. This is what Sensei must have meant when he said we already know it.
Kai::: Over the planks! Dodge the sword! Here comes the dummy! 
Kruncha:::He just called you a dummy.
Nuckal::: No, he called you a dummy.
Zane::: I sense you do not stand a chance.
Samukai:::Retreat!
Cole::: Huh! Guess they didn't want a second serving of these babies. 
Cole::: Good thing they didn't check out the merchandise in the back! 
Kai:::Alright!
Jay:::Woo hoo hoo!
Cole:::  Uh... guys...
Zane::: Didn't Sensei say there was a guardian protecting the Weapons?
Cole::: Is... that... a... that's not what I think it is. Is it?
Jay::: You mean a dragon?
Kai::: Uh, that sure looks like a dragon!
Zane::: I sense we won't be able to spin our way out of this one.
Cole::: I thought dragons weren't from this world!
Jay::: No no, Kai! Bad idea! Sensei told us not to!
Kai::: Then you better keep your mouth shut!
Cole:::Kai! DOOOON'T!
Kai::: We got our escape!
Cole::: We'll use Spinjitzu!
Cole:::That was so awesome!
Kai::: Yes! We are unbelievable!
Zane::: We are the best!
Jay::: Did you see that?! I was like "pow"! And you were like "bam"!
Wu:::Enough!I told you not to use the Scythe!
Jay:::He did it.
Kai:::What?
Cole::: I warned him, Sensei.
Kai::: Using it was my only option.
Wu::: And what makes you think you're more important than the team?! Huh?! Huh?!
Kai::: They took my sister, remember?!
Wu::: There are still three Weapons left. Maybe next time you can do it right.
Samukai::: Master, I have failed you. They have learned Spinjitzu and they have the Scythe.
Garmadon::: Good.Then my brother was there.
Samukai::: If I can gather my army, then we can easily ambush them and—
Garmadon:::  No. Let them think they're winning.
Samukai::: But I... do not understand.
Garmadon::: Everything is going to plan.
