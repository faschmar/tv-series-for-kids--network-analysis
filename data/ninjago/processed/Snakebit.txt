Wu::: Evil doesn't sleep and neither should you! 
Wu::: In order to reach your full potential, we must greet each day as an opportunity.
Kai:::Okay okay, we're up. But if you want us to reach full potential, shouldn't we at least get a full night of rest? 
Cole:::You call that a rest? I think my back had more lumps than the mattress.
Zane::: What is our lesson today, Sensei? Mastering the strike of the Scorpion? Or perhaps the grace of— 
Wu::: I think today's lesson would be chores.
Ninja::: Chores?!
Cole::: Ninja fight, Sensei. They do not clean.
Wu::: In order to respect ourselves, we must respect our new home and where we are from. And this place is a long way from becoming a ninja headquarters. I expect things to be spotless when I return. And put your backs into it. 
Kai:::This place is gonna take forever to clean and fix up.
Jay::: Unless we put more than our backs into it, huh?
Cole::: Ninja, go! 
Zane and Kai:::Ninja, go! 
Jay::: Ninja, go!
Kai::: What took you so long?
Nya::: Wow, This place looks amazing! You guys did all this?
Cole::: Ninja don't just fight, Nya. We clean.
Wu::: Oh, you have exceeded my expectations...
Wu::: ...but can you keep it up?
Nya::: Looks like we're about have some visitors, and loud ones at that.
Jay:::Ugh...It's my parents. Please, if they start yapping, just don't let them going, okay? They don't know when to quit. And if you start talking then they'll start talking, and suddenly half the day is gone before you know it ends...
Kai:::We get it! They talk a lot....the cherry doesn't fall far from its blossom.
Ed::: Oh, heh. Take a note, Edna. Either better brakes or a better bumper... Oh, will you look at all this great stuff? They can't just get rid of it. We should have brought the trailer, Edna.
Edna::: This ain't a flea market, Ed. We're here for Jay.
Ed::: What was that? Did you take a note?
Edna::: I'm writing it down, Ed.
Jay:::Mom! Dad! What are you doing here?
Edna::: Oh, look! It's my baby boy! It's been so long since we heard from you!
Jay::: Ma, I called you two days ago.
Ed:::Oh well... It's not soon enough, son. When are you coming out to the junkyard? You say you are coming an..an..and you don't.
Jay::: Dad...do we have to talk about the junkyard in front of my friends?
Edna::: He hates it when we tell people he was born in a junkyard.Oh... and who are you?You are so cute! You are just my son's type.
Jay::: Mom!
Nya::: It's a pleasure of meeting you. I'm sure if you want, Jay can give you a tour. He worked very hard on it.
Ed & Edna::: We'd love a tour!
Jay::: And this the bridge. This extends into a periscope. This tells what's going on of Ninjago. And this...if a Serpentine's not giving us the answer we want, and we're late up night..
Edna:::A neuro apparatus to read their minds?
Ed::: An audio appliance to make them talk?
Jay::: No, a cappuccino machine.
Ed::: Haha. Amazing, son! We're so proud of you.
Cole::: Why don't you tell them about the button?
Jay::: Heh heh it's not ready yet.
Edna::: Oh, what's the button?
Zane::: He's working on a special defense system.
Kai::: Something every ninja headquarters needs.
Ed::: Oh, really? What does it do? Can I help?
Jay::: No, it's okay. I don't need your help, dad. Let's just leave it alone. Hey, look at the time. Don't you need to get back before it gets dark? I told you, there's dangerous Serpentine out there.
Ed::: Uh, I suppose we could get back.
Cole::: Edna, it was a pleasure hearing about Jay's first potty time.
Edna::: Oh, if you thought that was good, wait until you hear the story about the time I caught him kissing his pillow!
Jay:::Snakes, ma. Snakes!
Edna::: Okay, we're going. We're going.
Edna::: So you promise to come to the junkyard to visit your mother and father?
Jay::: Yes, I promise! But only if you leave. I don't want you to get hurt. It's getting dark. Uh, your headlights are working, right?
Ed::: Heh, like 'em? I used a little extra juice.Yep. Bye, son. I couldn't be more proud.
Ed::: And bring Nya with you, will ya? I can see why you like her.
Jay::: Mom!
Wu::: Now that they have left, maybe Jay can teach us the art of kissing pillows... 
Jay::: Ugh!
Ed::: I don't think he's coming, dear.
Edna::: Stop it, Ed. He's coming.
Ed::: No, he doesn't need us anymore. I just have to remember that. Uh, write it down for me, would ya?
Edna::: Oh, dear. Lights, dear. It's getting dark.
Ed::: Right, heh. Thanks, sugarplum.
Fangtom #1::: And who...
Fangtom #2::: ...may I say released us...
Fangtom #1::: ...from our captivity?
Lloyd::: Uh, Lloyd? I released you to make the Hypnobrai pay for betraying me.
Fangtom #2::: The Hypnobrai?
Fangtom #1::: Those hypnotizing deceivers.
Fangtom #2::: It'll be...
Fangtom #1::: ...our pleasure.
Lloyd::: Oh, good. I'll lead the way. Then after that, there's some ninja I want dealt with.
Fangtom #1::: Sounds like...
Fangtom #2::: ...you know...
Fangtom #1::: ...what you want.
Fangtom #2::: But the Hypnobrai are strong.
Fangtom #1::: And we are few in numbers.
Fangtom #2::: We need...
Fangtom #1::: ...reinforcements!
Lloyd::: What did you have in mind?
Ed::: Home, sweet home. And back to the grind. 
Edna::: Oh, sweetie. You've been working on that thing day and night.
Ed::: Well, you never know when Jay may show up.
Edna::: Oh, you're right. You never know.
Ed::: Uh, Edna? Was that you?
Edna::: What, Ed? Are you hearing things again?
Ed::: Uh, you uh, you turned on the security alarm before you left, didn't ya, hun?
Edna:::Uh, must be broken.
Ed::: Whoever's there, my son knows Spinjitzu! 
Edna::: What is it, Ed? Oh, why are the lights out?
Ed::: Call Jay, hun. Someone's broken in!
Lloyd::: How about we wait until he calls you?Muahahaha!
Edna::: Ed...
Ed::: Be strong, Edna. I won't let them hurt you.
Fangtom #1::: If we plan...
Fangtom #2::: ...to attack...
Fangtom #1::: ...the Hypnobrai...
Fangtom #2::: ...we'll need to grow...
Fangtom #1::: ...our army.
Lloyd::: And uh, how do we do that?
Fangtom #2::: Let's just say...
Fangtom #1::: ...we Fangpyre bite off more...
Fangtom #2::: ...than we can chew.
Fangtom #1::: Have at it, boys!
Ed::: My creations! They are turning them into—
Fangtom #1::: An army?
Fangtom #2::: You are correct.
Fangtom #1::: But we can also turn people, too
Kai::: Sure got a lot of junk piling up. If only there was a place we could get rid of it...
Jay::: If you don't mind, I'm trying to focus.
Cole:::Hi, mom and dad. Of course, I'd love to visit. What kind of son would I be if I didn't want to?
Jay::: Heheheheh. I know what you're trying to do. Okay, look, I might have promised to visit my parents, but there's a lot of stuff on my plate.
Jay:::Hehe. Hi, Nya.
Nya::: You gonna visit your parents, today?
Jay::: Uh, sure am. Just about to leave.
Nya::: Tell them I say hi.
Jay::: What? So my plate's not that full.
Jay::: Come on, Wisp. It'll be a quick visit. Just in and out, nothing more.
Wu::: Hm, it is as I suspected. The dragons are molting. They're shedding their scales.
Jay::: What does that mean?
Wu::: Every adolescent dragon goes through a transformation before it becomes an adult. We must allow them to migrate east to the Spirit Coves for their transformation.
Jay::: Will we see them again?
Wu::: It is hard to say. But we need to allow them to follow their path.
Cole::: Rocky's going east?Say it isn't so, Rocky.
Jay:::Well, I guess I gotta go on this long walk all by myself. Sure be nice to have company... 
Kai::: Of course we'll go, buddy.
Cole::: I could use a break.
Zane::: All you had to do was ask.
Jay:::Of all the days to lose our ride...
Zane::: That flute. You've never told us why it's so special.
Wu::: Long ago there were many flutes, created to combat the powers of the Serpentine and drive them underground. But over time, Ninjago's forgotten its ancestors' wisdom, and now this is the only one. 
Jay::: I get the lesson: respect your elders or else suffer the consequences. Boy, you guys are laying it on thick.
Wu:::Perhaps you are only hearing what you need to hear.
Nya::: What is it?
Jay::: It's quiet. My family's never quiet. 
Jay::: What happened? Who did this? 
Edna::: Sweetheart, you came!
Ed::: Oh, you gotta get out of here. You shouldn't have come, it's the ssssnakes!
Wu::: The bite of the Fangpyre! Once they sink their teeth, their venom can turn anything into a serpent. It's only a matter of time before the full transformation is complete.
Cole::: Uh, is that wrecking ball staring at me?
Jay::: Duck! 
Ed:::Thankssss, sssson.
Wu::: Lloyd!
Lloyd::: Hello, uncle. Looks like we're not the only family reunion. I'm glad you brought the ninja. I could use some help taking out the trash. Muahaha!
Nya::: If we want to turn your parents back, we need the antivenom in the staff.
Cole::: Second dose, to the dirt! 
Kai::: Easier said than done, sis. We're a bit outnumbered.
Jay::: Nobody messes with my family. Ninja, go!
Kai, Cole, and Zane::: Ninja, go!
Nya:::I don't know, Sensei. I think we make a pretty good duet.
Wu::: Young nephew, must I teach you whose side you should be on?
Lloyd:::Sorry, uncle. Can't hear you!
Ed::: Yeah, way to go, Edna!
Ninja::: Ninja, go!
Jay::: Ah! What is that thing?
Ed::: It was supposed to be in your honor, son, but do you like it?
Jay::: Thanks, but no thanks.
Cole::: Why'd you have to be born in a Junkyard?
Jay::: I know. Tell me about it.
Kai::: Uh, wasn't there four of us?
Jay::: Let's see if I can work this. 
Cole:::Don't worry, I got it.I told you, I had it.
Lloyd::: Retreat! 
Nya::: He's getting away with the staff!
Jay:::Right now would be a good time to have those Dragons.
Ed::: It'ssss okay, sssson.
Wu::: There is still a way.
Jay::: How?
Wu::: Part of reaching your own full potential is understanding your weapon's potential. Once it is in tune with a focused heart, its secrets and powers can be unlocked.
Jay::: Oh, this is not the time to be cryptic.
Zane::: He's saying our weapons are vehicles themselves.
Kai::: Don't tell me I have to ride this thing like a broomstick.
Wu::: Jay, concentrate on unlocking your Golden Weapon. Let your heart guide you. Imagine you're taking flight.
Jay::: Whoa! Haha, did I just do that?
Cole::: Ha! I hate to hurt Rocky's feelings, but I think he's just been replaced.
Nya::: Does your flute turn into anything?
Wu:::I wish.
Lloyd::: Whoa, what the heck was that?
Jay::: Oops, haha. Overshot that a little.Let's see what this baby can do.Whoa!
Fangtom #2::: Duck!The Staff!
Jay::: I got it?I got it!Uh-oh. 
Kai::: Jay! You have to concentrate!
Jay::: I can't!
Cole::: I think we're gonna have to catch him.
Kai::: I got him. I got him.
Cole::: No, I got him!
Zane::: He's mine!
Jay::: Heh, nice.
Edna::: Aw, I knew I liked thissss girl.
Fangtom #2::: Everyone!
Fangtom #1::: Attack!
Kai::: Huh? Why isn't this thing working?
Wu::: Your weapon is merely an extension of your mind. If your mind is immobile, so is your weapon.
Ed::: Oh, boy. Oh, gosh. Oh, golly, oh, duh. Get in, boys!
Jay::: We have to get back to headquarters!
Lloyd::: Go! They're getting away!
Nya::: Come with me. Once we reverse the venom, we can fix you.
Jay::: Man the stations, everyone!
Kai::: Jay, we better hurry.
Jay::: I've been waiting for this moment. 
Kai::: They're gaining on us!
Ed::: Bottoms, up!
Ed::: Oh, that's good.
Jay::: Ugh, I don't get what's wrong. I spent forever on this. It's supposed to work!
Ed::: Uh, son? Maybe I can help?
Jay:::Dad! You're okay!
Ed::: You're darn tooting. Oh, let's have a look.Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, that should do it. Now try it.
Lloyd::: No, no, no, no! 
Fangtom #2::: These ninja...
Fangtom #1::: ...they must be stopped.
Lloyd::: Oh, tell me about it.
Jay::: We'll get you back to the Junkyard just as soon as we see the coast is clear. But stay as long as you'd like. It's nice having you here.
Ed::: Oh, take a note Edna: of all our inventions, this one is our greatest.
Edna::: I already know, dear.
