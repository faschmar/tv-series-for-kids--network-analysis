Nya:::Oh! Sorry, uh, I'll just step aside.
Jay:::Um, I'm going to step aside.We just can't get in sync, can we? 
Nya::: Let's do something fun. We have the whole afternoon free.
Jay::: Oh, I already made plans down at the arcade. There's this game I really want to beat.
Nya::: Oh. No, that's... that's fine.Um, some other time maybe. 
Jay::: Hey, how about when I get back, we do something you want to do?
Nya::: Really? Cause I've always wanted to take...dance lessons!Riding, jumping, and fighting is great, but sometimes I just want to glide across the dance floor.
Jay::: Oh. Anything else?
Nya::: Come on. You're always playing video games. Don't you want to do something that pushes you? Expand your horizons?
Jay:::I'll do this for you, Nya. On one condition. It stays between us.
Nya:::Mhmm.
Jay::: You're all dressed up! No one said this was fancy! I-I'm gonna go home and change. 
Nya::: You're fine! I just wanted to take this seriously.I might be... overdressed, actually.
Vlad::: Step, step. Here you will grow quickly: balance, technique, or be smooshed. Scurry like little ants on the floor, go, go!Find your ant and face each other. Now, my little dumplings, chins up. Walk-ups. And on three.One, two, three. One, two, three. 
Jay::: Ow! 
Nya::: Oh! Sorry.
Jay::: It's okay. Let's try again.
Vlad:::Yes, lovely. You are no ant. You are dancer. But you, my little muskox, no, no, no, you ruin his form. Stop watching feet. 
Nya::: How are you so good at this?
Jay::: I don't know. I guess it just comes naturally.Let's try this, one more time. Together. 
Nya::: I really appreciate you trying something I wanted to do. So I want to do the same. Join you in something you love doing?
Jay::: Want to go to the arcade with me?This, here, is my favorite game. Dancy Pants!
Nya::: Oh ho, so this is why you're such a natural. 
Jay:::Ahem, may I have this dance? 
Lloyd::: Jay, come in! It's Lloyd. We just received a report about the Mechanic breaking into a warehouse.
Jay:::Send us the coordinates. We'll be there as soon as we can. 
Nya::: But we have something important to do first. 
Jay::: Yeah! We've got this!
