Past Julien::: Can I help you?
Past Wu::: I'm looking for a boy named Zane.
Past Julien::: Hm. He's out back chopping wood. I'll take you to him. It's curious, you're our second guest in a long while. An old man visited us last night. He had taken ill, and he needed shelter. It was as if winter had followed him here.
Past Wu::: The Master of Ice.
Past Julien::: Well, of course, we gave him shelter, food. He was very thankful, and very intrigued by my son. It's peculiar. Ever since he left, Zane's been acting stranger than usual.
Past Wu::: Very peculiar indeed.
Past Julien::: Here he is.
Past Wu::: Hello, Zane.
Past Zane::: Hello. Have we met?
Past Wu::: No. But some would say I have a knack at finding young talent.
Past Zane::: Do you need me to chop wood?
Past Wu::: Hehe. Maybe one day, but not today.
Past Zane::: Then why are you here? Are you lost?
Past Wu::: Lost? Hm. An interesting word. Sometimes one has to be lost in order to be found.
Past Zane::: That does not make any sense.
Past Wu::: Maybe one day, but not today. Goodbye, Zane.
Past Zane::: Uh, will I see you again?
Past Wu::: I'm sure of it. And when we do, you'll be asked to do far more than chop wood.
Zane::: The Big Man?
Lloyd::: Where was Zane last seen?
Jay::: Central Station. But once they went underground, P.I.X.A.L. lost his signal. We haven't been able to pick up Cole's intercom either.
Lloyd::: If they're taking Zane to their hideout, then Cole could be held captive there. We can't lose Zane. I'm over Central now. 
Man::: Oh, look, son! It's the Green Ninja!
Boy::: Is it? Where?
Man::: There! Look! 
Boy::: Yeah right, Dad, very funny.
Lloyd::: No sign of Zane or Cole. They could be anywhere by now. 
Kai::: Ugh, do you mind, sis? We're trying to save Cole and Zane.
Nya::: What do you think I'm doing? Zane won't last long undercover in a biker gang without a bike.
Kai::: Oh.
Nya::: Harumi, can you hand me the electric torque wrench?
Harumi::: Yes, of course. 
Nya::: Oh, sweetie, that's the torque multiplier.
Harumi::: Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe I should be doing something more useful.
Kai::: Lloyd, did you find their hideout?
Lloyd::: No sign of Zane or Cole. They could be anywhere by now.
Jay::: Don't worry. We'll find them. Kai and I will search other stations.
Lloyd::: Where are you, Zane?
Cole::: Ah! Vengestone.
Chopper Maroon::: Careful!
Mohawk::: What do you think I'm doing?So, what's in the box?
Chopper Maroon::: You haven't heard? The boss found the key for the last mask.
Cole::: If they get the last mask, then they'll have all three.
Chopper Maroon::: Ha! It's all coming together. It'll be good to see Lord Garmadon again.
Mohawk::: You mean it'll be bad.
Cole::: Lord Garmadon?
Chopper Maroon::: Hey! You always talk to yourself this much? Shut it!
Cole::: I don't talk to myself that much. I mean, sometimes, but not that much. I mean, it's only when I just kind ofâ€”oh.
Zane::: Um...so you're the Big Man?
Big Man::: And you're the scum who saved Mr. E.They say your name is Snake Jaguar. What sort of name is that?
Zane::: The sort that can put you on your backside if you have to ask.So you're in charge of the Sons of Garmadon.
Big Man:::He thinks I'm in charge.I'm Killow. It's my job to decide who's in and who's out. You wanna know more about us, first you gotta become one of us. And to be a Son of Garmadon, you first have to ride with us. So what do you say, boys and girls? Shall we take him to The Teeth?
Sons of Garmadon::: Teeth! Teeth! Teeth! Teeth! Teeth! Teeth! Teeth! Teeth! Teeth! Teeth! Teeth! Teeth!
Ultra Violet:::Eyes forward, weirdo.
Zane::: What is The Teeth?
Killow::: Like I said, you want answers, first you have to ride.
Ultra Violet:::He doesn't have a bike. 
Killow::: You want to join a motorcycle gang and you have no bike?
Zane::: I rammed it right down those ninja's throats. They had it coming.
Killow::: You can have Ultra Violet's.
Ultra Violet::: Huh? What? What? But I wanna ride.
Killow::: The Quiet One wants you here.
Zane:::The Quiet One?
"Ultra Violet"::: I want a word with the ninja! In private!
Chopper Maroon::: Oh, hey, easy. Of course, Ultra Violet. He's all yours.
Mohawk::: Yeah, as long as it's not me. Do whatever you want. 
Cole::: I ain't in the mood, sunshine.Zane!
Zane::: Shh.
Cole::: Oh, haha! Oh, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.
Zane::: Did they hurt your eyes?
Cole::: Yes. No. I'll explain later. Just get me outta here. They have the key to the third mask.
Zane::: The key?
Cole::: If they unite all the masks, they're gonna resurrect Lord Garmadon. The bad one! Four arms and all. We need to get that key and get outta here.
Zane::: Um...
Cole::: Well, what are you waiting for? Unlock the door. Let's go!
Zane::: I can't. I need to ride with them to learn who's behind all this.
Cole::: They're gonna get all the masks! Who cares who's in charge?
Zane::: When the station clears, break out. Break out and steal the key.
Ultra Violet::: What do you mean I just walked past here? Get your eyes fixed.
Zane::: Good luck, friend. 
Cole::: How am I supposed to steal the key? I need a key! Zane? Zane!Uh...Sane! I'm not sane! Get me outta here! I'm insane! Argh! Aah!
Ultra Violet::: You and I both. 
Ultra Violet::: Bikers ready?
Killow:::You know the rules when you ride with us?
Zane::: Let me guess: there are no rules?
Killow::: Well, that was no fun, was it?
Ultra Violet::: Ride or die! 
Zane::: Come on, Zane. You can do this.
Ultra Violet:::What do you want? Oh. No, I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you. What? He is? I'll tell Killow right away.
Killow:::Yes?
Ultra Violet::: He's one of the ninja.
Killow::: Who?
Ultra Violet::: Snake Jaguar.
Killow::: Snake Jaguar's a spy? Make sure the new guy doesn't finish the race.
Son of Garmadon::: I see you, ninja.Ice! 
Son of Garmadon::: Darn it!Phew. 
Tommy::: Ah, dang it!
Simon::: Didn't spill my coffee. 
Tommy::: Well, what are you waiting for? Go, go, go! 
Simon::: Still didn't spill it!Arrgh!
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L., can you read me? My cover may be blown, but I've spotted the Mask of Deception.
P.I.X.A.L.::: I read you. Acquiring picture.
Harumi::: Did he say he sees the Mask of Deception?
Zane::: I don't know how long I'll last, so I'll tell you this now. I don't know who's in charge, but he is known as "The Quiet One."
Harumi::: The Quiet One?
Nya::: Hold tight a little longer. We have a new bike coming to you now! Zane, where's Cole?
Cole::: Okay, think. Think, Cole. You're not thinking, you're running your mouth. Look who's talking. Now I am having a conversation with myself. How annoying is that?
Chopper Maroon::: Hey, Dangerbuff, be quiet!
Cole::: That's it! Ahem. Shine, little glow worm, glimmer glimmer. Hey there glow worm. Don't get dimmer! Shine, little glow worm, glimmer glimmer! Hey there, little glow worm! Don't get dimmer! Shine, little glow worm! Don't get dimmer! Hey, little glow worm!
Chopper Maroon:::Stop!
Cole::: Glimmer glimmer! Shine, little glow worm! Don't get dimmer! Shine, little glow worm, shine, little glow worm, glimmer glimmer!
Chopper Maroon:::I can't take it!Would you stop!?
Cole::: Hm, maybe.Dad would be proud.
Zane::: P.I.X.A.L., the mask is getting away. Can you find me a route through?
P.I.X.A.L.::: All routes are blocked.
Zane::: Then I'll have to find my own.Just passing through!
Man::: Look, son, there's the Titanium one! 
Boy::: Yeah, right, Dad.
Nya::: Zane. Look up. You have some help. Let her fly. 
Zane::: This will do.
Nya::: Hope we're not too late to the party. Think you can catch up?
Zane::: I don't think. I know.
Driver::: Wow! How do I rent one of those?
Cole::: Huh.The key to the third mask?Ugh! Uh oh! And...that's not a key. Sorry, baby, but I'm looking for a key. I gotta go. You understand.Oh, fine. But for the record, I'm no longer talking to myself. I'm talking to you.
Ultra Violet:::You didn't think it'd be that easy, did you?Sweet, isn't he?
Cole::: "He?" If you want the masks to bring back Garmadon, why take a child?
Ultra Violet::: You really have no clue, do you? 
Cole::: You wouldn't hurt a child!
Ultra Violet::: Lord Garmadon will not be stopped.
Cole::: Lloyd saved his father. He sacrificed himself for Ninjago. He wasn't a bad man.
Ultra Violet::: This one will be.Lord Garmadon will eventually destroy you all. 
Zane::: Yes, this will do just fine. 
Son of Garmadon::: Argh, Snake Jaguar!
Zane::: I've caught up with the mask. 
Nya::: Zane, are you seeing what we're seeing?
Zane::: I was going to ask you the same thing.
Nya::: If you're having trouble, I built in some additional help.
Zane::: I see that now. Activating.It's good to see you too, my old friend. Or should I say, new?
Killow::: You brought a ninja with you. This is your fault! Fix it! 
Zane::: You're the Quiet One, aren't you? You're the one in charge! Ugh! Who are you?Who are you!?You're...You're like me. A Nindroid.
