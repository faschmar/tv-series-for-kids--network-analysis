''(In his throne room, the [[Vangelis|Skull Sorcerer]] looks into [[The Pit (Shintaro)|the Pit]].)''

'''[[Hazza D'ur]]''': Nothing comes without sacrifice.

'''Skull Sorcerer''': My [[Sky Folk|subjects]] will want to know what happened to their [[Vania|princess]]. (He transforms back into Vangelis.) Luckily, I have the perfect scapegoat. Or should I say, [[Chompy|dragon]]. [[Army of Shintaro|Guards]]! There's been a terrible accident. The Princess fell into the Pit.

'''[[Hailmar]]''': How?

'''Vangelis''': It was that - that creature! It turned on her and attacked her. I want it locked up!

'''Hailmar''': The Princess' dragon? Chompy?

'''Vangelis''': You heard me. I want the beast locked up! Now!

(In the Pit, [[Cole]] and [[Wu]] scream as they fall.)

'''Cole''': Master Wu! Are you okay?

'''Wu''': What?

'''Cole''': I said, are you okay?

'''Wu''': For the moment, yes!

'''Cole''': Speed up! I can't hear you!

'''Wu''': I'm falling as fast as I can! You have to slow down!

'''Cole''': How?

'''Wu''': Use your [[Earth|Elemental Powers]]!

'''Cole''': What?

'''Wu''': Your Elemental Powers! Use your powers to slow down! (He flaps his arms.)

'''Cole''': You really think that would work?

'''Wu''': Yes!

'''Cole''': Okay, here goes nothing. (He flaps his arms. Wu raises an eyebrow.) It's not working!

'''Vania''': Master Wu! Cole!

'''Wu''': Princess Vania?

'''Vania''': I'm coming! But you have to slow down!

'''Wu''': How?

'''Vania''': Use your arms, like this! (She flaps her arms.)

'''Wu''': (He does so, then stops.) Oh, what am I doing? It's no use. That won't work!

'''Cole''': I've got an idea. (He grabs a vine, but it breaks.) I need a bigger vine. (He grabs another, but it breaks when he slams into the walls.)

'''Wu''': Cole! Stop playing with those twigs and stay with me! (They join hands.)

'''Cole''': Gotcha.

'''Vania''': Hang on. I'm almost there!

'''Cole''': Are you sure those wings will hold all three of us?

'''Vania''': No, but it's our only chance! Now reach! (Cole and Wu grab her.) Gotcha! (The wings break.) Oh no!

'''Cole''': Oh, I was afraid of that!

'''Vania''': What do we do?

'''Wu''': Firstly, allow me to say you are handling this situation remarkably well.

'''Vania''': Thank you, but I'm with you and Cole and I'm sure you've been in way worse situations.

'''Wu''': Uh...

'''Cole''': Uh, nope.

'''Vania''': But I'm sure you have a plan.

'''Cole''': Not me!

'''Wu''': Alas, no. (Vania screams as the trio fall onto a sticky spiderweb.)

'''Wu''': This is not an improvement.

'''Cole''': It's-it's not working. I'm just getting more and more stuck.

'''Vania''': We have to calm down and think. I read in a [[Boobytraps and How to Survive Them (book)|book]] by the highly acclaimed adventurer and explorer, [[Clutch Powers]], that the key to staying calm is to do vocal exercises like - AAH! (Her scream attracts some spiders.)

'''Cole''': Oh boy. (A spider snatches him up and covers him with webs.)

'''Wu''': Hold on, Cole!

'''Cole''': Please get me out of here!

'''Vania''': Cole! Try to remain calm!

'''Cole''': It's very hard!

'''Cole''': What's happening? I can't see anything!

'''Wu''': That's probably for the best!

'''Vania''': There are two giant spiders fighting over you!

'''Cole''': What? Get them away from me!

'''Vania''': Uh, they have very large fangs and both look very hungry. Ooh, but the good news is, they just dropped you and are now fighting each other. (A third spider shows up.) Uh oh.

'''Cole''': "Uh oh"? What is "Uh oh" mean?

'''Vania''': There's a third spider, and it looks even more hungry than the others!

'''Cole''': Now what's going on?

'''Vania''': It's going to eat you!

'''Cole''': Aah! Do something!

'''Vania''': I ''am'' doing something! (She throws an object at the spider.) Take that! (She throws another. The spider turns to attack her.) Oh no! (She hurls a [[naginata]], then a shield.) Okay. Get away. Shoo. Shoo! Bad spider. Bad!

'''Cole''': Help me!

'''Vania''': (She kicks a naginata to Wu, who cuts Cole free.) Master Wu! What do we do?

'''Wu''': I'm thinking.

'''Vania''': This can't be good!

'''Cole''': I have an idea, but I don't think you're gonna like it.

'''Wu''': Just do it!

'''Cole''': Uh, if you say so! (He cuts the web with a naginata and they all fall.)

'''Wu''': We're falling again.

'''Cole''': Well, falling is better than being eaten by spiders.

'''Vania''': It's not the falling I'm worried about. It's the landing.

'''Wu''': (They land on a slope and start sliding.) Take my hand. Before we get separated! (They get separated.)

'''Cole''': Master Wu?

'''Wu''': Cole.

'''Cole''': Are you still falling?

'''Wu''': More like sliding.

'''Cole''': Okay, just checking. We are, too. (They land in water.)

'''Wu''': This is outrageous.

'''Cole''': There's nothing to hold onto.

'''Wu''': Grab onto those rocks. (They climb onto some rocks, which turn out to be a [[Stone turtles|stone turtle]]. They continue falling and land in a whirlpool.)

'''Vania''': Help!

'''Wu''': Now what?

'''Cole''': It's a whirlpool! It's like a giant toilet that's been flushed, except in this case, we're the -

'''Wu''': I know, Cole. Just swim. (He spots a stalactite above.) Cole! The stalactites. Break them off. Use your powers!

'''Cole''': How? I can't reach them!

'''Wu''': You can do it. You have to try! (Cole uses his [[Earth Punch]].) Cole, you can do it! You are surrounded by [[earth]]. Connect with your Element. Your powers should be stronger than ever.

'''Vania''': Concentrate, Cole!

'''Wu''': (He successfully stops the whirlpool with the stalactite and they climb onto it.) I-I think we're safe now.

'''Vania''': We just need to find a way out of here. And let's avoid going further down.

'''Cole''': How can we get any lower? (He slams his arms onto the stalactite, accidentally breaking it.)

'''Vania''': Uh oh. (They fall into a pool. Cole drags Vania and Wu out, who are both unconscious.)

'''[[Fungus|Sorcerer]]''': Ah, visitors from above.

'''Cole''': Aah!

'''Sorcerer''': The good King Vangelis has cast you out, has he? Well, fear not, weary travelers, for you are safe now. You are in [[Rock-Bottom]], and there is no further to fall.

'''[[Plundar|Thief]]''': (Cole backs away from their spider.) Relax, pal, that's just [[Adam]]. He's harmless.

'''[[Korgran|Barbarian]]''': You are safe here. You are among us. The [[Upply|Lowly]].

'''Cole''': Huh? What?

'''Thief''': Might as well get used to it, because there ain't no way back up. This is your new home, pal. (Cole faints.)
