}}''(The [[Geckles]], the [[Munce]], and the [[ninja]] except [[Cole]] run from the [[Grief-Bringer]].)''

'''[[Murtessa]]''': That horrible cry! That's Mief-Bringer, the [[Dragons|dragon]]! No mistake.

'''[[Nya]]''': You said Grief-Bringer was killed by some [[Lilly|great hero]]!

'''Murtessa''': It was! It's back. [[Vangelis|Skull Sorcerer]] must have reanimated it.

'''[[Gulch]]''': (panting) The cave! The [[Geckle Strong-Cave|Strong-Cave]]!

'''[[Kai]]''': What?

'''Gulch''': The—the Strong-Cave. It's our. . . (pants) our only hope!

'''Kai''': Oh, finally, some good news. Guys—

'''Gulch''': (He covers Kai's mouth.) Shh! Don't say it out loud! Do you want the Munce to hear?

'''Kai''': Yeah, that's the point, Gulch! If we leave them out here, they'll get chewed up by that thing! Follow us, everyone!

'''[[Hazza D'ur]]''': They flee into the [[Shintaro|mountain]].

'''Skull Sorcerer''': Bring it all down! (The Grief-Bringer smashes into the stalactites and creates a bridge across the lava.) After them. All of [[Re-Awakened|you]]!

''(The Geckles and Munce take refuge in the Geckle Strong-Cave.)''

'''Gulch''': Cha. . . (panting) Chancellor Kai. . . you must order the cave sealed!

'''Kai''': I have to actually say that? Okay, seal the cave! Now! (The Geckles turn the crank, slowly sealing the cave. Then the chain come to a stop. )

'''Geckle''': It's stuck!

'''Nya''': Forget the wheel! Cut the chain!

'''[[Lloyd]]''': They're not gonna get shut in time.

'''[[Jay]]''': Then we better buy them some time!

'''Lloyd''': You—

'''Jay''': —shall—

'''Kai''': —not—

'''[[Zane]]''': —be granted permission to traverse beyond this point. (The other three turn to look at him.)

'''Lloyd, Jay, Kai, and Zane''': Ninja, go! (They do [[Spinjitzu]].)

'''Kai''': (He boosts Lloyd with his shield.) Haha! (They are surrounded.) Look out!

'''Murtessa''': (She finally breaks the chain.) It's coming down!

'''Nya''': Guys! Get in here!

'''Lloyd''': Run! (They slide in just in time, while the Grief-Bringer crashes into the door.)

'''Kai''': Hopefully we're safe for now.

'''Gulch''': Are you kidding? We are not safe! The enemy is among us. You let them into our cave!

'''Jay''': What? Where?

'''Gulch''': The Munce! (The Geckles and Munce begin to murmur among themselves.)

'''Kai''': You're doing this now?

'''Lloyd''': Are you kidding?

'''Kai''': Come on!

'''Gulch''': Hide your possessions, Geckles, before the Munce steal them! Like they stole the [[Ivory Blade of Deliverance]]!

'''Murtessa''': ''You'' stole [[Shadow Blade of Deliverance|blade]]! The blade of Milly!

'''Gulch''': It's ''Gilly'', you glop-mouthed—

'''Murtessa''': Milly is ''our'' legend, you legend stealing stealer-of-legends! Munce, look through cave for our blade, that Geckle stole from us! Finding it would make being in prison here worth it!

'''Gulch''': Oh, you can leave any time!

'''Murtessa''': Oh? There is other way out of this cave?

'''Gulch''': Of course not! Do you even understand the point of a strong-cave?

'''Skull Sorcerer''': Geckles! Munce! Hear me! I offer you a chance! And one chance only! Send out the ninja and I will spare your lives. I will show you mercy.

'''Hazza D'ur''': Mercy! Mercy!

'''Skull Sorcerer''': Send them out and you will be allowed to return to work in the [[Mines of Shintaro|mines]]. All shall be as it was, a time of peace and hard work. So swears the Skull Sorcerer.

'''Murtessa''': (Simultaneously) Never!

'''Gulch''': (Simultaneously) No way!

'''Murtessa''': I am talking, Geckle!

'''Gulch''': We both started talking at the same time!

'''Murtessa''': No, I said the "Ne" in "Never" before you open mouth.

'''Skull Sorcerer''': All of you—

'''Gulch''': All right, who was watching? Did anyone see who opened their mouth first?

'''Skull Sorcerer''': Here me—

'''Nya''': Would one of you just respond?

'''Murtessa''': Munce will never serve Skull Sorcerer!

'''Gulch''': As much as it pains me to agree with a Munce, neither will the Geckles!

'''Skull Sorcerer''': So be it. Grief-Bringer, my skeletons, destroy them!

'''Hazza D'ur''': (laughs evilly) Destruction! Devastation!

'''Kai''': It's cracking! (To Gulch) You said this strong-cave could withstand the Grief-Bringer!

'''Gulch''': Well, we thought it could, but it's never been tested against the resurrected-skeleton-dragon and an army of evil-skeletons. Without Gilly, all is lost.

'''Nya''': (She studies a pile of rocks.) Zane! Can you scan this?

'''Zane''': There's a space behind this wall of rocks. Possibly a previously covered-up exit.

'''Nya''': Listen up! There's an opening behind this rock wall! We're not sure, but it could be a way out. If we're going to bring down this wall, we need everyone's help. And by everyone, I mean ''everyone''! (The Geckles and Munce work together to remove the rocks.)

'''Gulch''': Look! There's something back here!

'''Murtessa''': He's right! A chamber!

'''Nya''': Look at them. They're working together. Side by side.

'''Lloyd''': I never thought I'd see that.

'''Kai''': (He enters the chamber, illuminating the room with his [[Fire]].) Huh? No. It's a dead-end.

'''Murtessa''': Hmm. What we do?

'''Gulch''': There's no other way out.

'''Jay''': No. They'll get through any minute.

'''Gulch''': I—I am sorry. I was wrong to lead you all here.

'''Murtessa''': Mm. You gave us shelter. I too am sorry.

'''Gulch''': For what?

'''Murtessa''': You Geckles value family, like Munce. You work hard, like Munce. You honor Milly, like Munce. Is possible . . . we are not so different?

'''Gulch''': I . . . was a fool. I saw only the things that made us different, not the things we had in common.

'''Murtessa''': We were all foolish.

'''Gulch''': We have a common enemy. Let us stand together and face him as allies.

'''Murtessa''': Agreed. Let us put aside differences and face him together.

'''Kai''': ''(Sighs)'' This is so beautiful. Two peoples, coming together in peace, love, and harmony.

'''Gulch''': No, we are ''not'' at peace.

'''Kai''': But—I—I thought—

'''Gulch''': It must be declared, formally. By you! You are the Chancellor.

'''Kai''': Oh, uh, okay. Uh, then, by the power vested in me as Geckle Chancellor, I hereby declare peace with the Munce. (Zane throws a pebble at Kai, annoying him.)

'''Nya''': By my power as Queen, I declare peace with the Geckles.

'''Murtessa''': ''Now'', we are at peace.

''(The Skull Sorcerer finally breaks through the door. The ninja, the Geckles, and the Munce take fighting stances.)''

'''Lloyd''': Wait! We'll do it! We'll take your deal!

'''Murtessa, Gulch, and the ninja''': What?

'''Lloyd''': Your offer. We turn ourselves in, you let them all go, but not back to the mines. You let them ''free''. If you swear to that, we will surrender without a fight.

'''Skull Sorcerer''': Hmm. Agreed. (The ninja are escorted out.)

'''Gulch''': Once again, outsiders have risked everything to save us.

'''Murtessa''': Now, leave us in peace, as you promised!

'''Skull Sorcerer''': Oh, that. You didn't really believe that, did you? (The Re-Awakened surround the Geckles and Munce.)

'''Hazza D'ur''': Fools! Fools! (laughs)
