''([[Jay]] and [[Scott]] have recovered from their mayhem in [[Terra Technica]].)''

'''Jay''': Why are [[Red Visors|those guys]] chasing you?! And why are they chasing me?! And what is this place?!

'''Scott''': I can answer that. Actually, no, there's no time! We gotta get out of here before they send more. We're not gonna get far like this. ''(He spots the two Red Visor helmets.)'' Hang on. I got an idea.

'''Jay''': What—uh—where did those guys go? What happened to them?

'''Scott''': Look! In ten seconds, there'll be a lot more of them! We don't have time. Trust me! Put this on and follow me! ''(With the helmets on, they easily walk throughout Prime Empire without ahyone questioning them.)''

'''Jay''': Our disguises seem to be working. Ooh.

'''Announcer''': The [[Speedway Five-Billion]]! The greatest race in the world for the [[Yellow Key-Tana|greatest prize]] in the world, the [[Key-Tanas|Key-Tana]]!

'''Jay''': What's a Key-Tana?

'''Scott''': ''(He spots two Red Visors up ahead.)'' Oh, great. Okay, just, uh, just stay cool and follow my lead. Act normal.

'''Jay''': Normal?! Nothing about this is normal! ''(They walk past the guards until one of them stops them.)''

'''Red Visor''': Hey! ''(Jay and Scott stop and turn around.)'' Where do you two think you're going? Why are you wearing these clothes? Where are your uniforms? Identify yourselves.

'''Scott''': ''(He lowers his voice.)'' Um, ahem, I am Red 29.

'''Red Visor''': What? ''(Points at another Visor.)'' He is [[Red 29]].

'''Scott''': Red... 27 is what I was saying. Of course, you're Red 29. ''(The Red Visors scan over Jay.)''

'''Jay''': Uh... it's a disguise! We're undercover.

'''Red Visor''': Undercover? Why was I not told?

'''Jay''': We're way undercover! Like ''way'' ''undercover''.

'''Scott''': We should get going. Come on, 17. ''(As Jay and Scott walk away, another Visor comes up.)''

'''[[Red 27]]''': Red 27. Reporting for duty. ''(The other Visors realize it is a trick and turn back to Jay and Scott.)''

'''Red Visor''': Stop them! ''(Red 27 keeps guard while the first Red Visor and Red 29 chase down Jay and Scott. They stop short when they see another pair of Visors running towards them.)''

'''Jay''': (''29 fires a shot a Jay but he ducks, allowing the shot to pass overhead, knocking out another Visor. Jay grabs another Visor's gun and whips him around, catching him off guard, and punches him to the ground.) ''Yah! ''(Another Visor throws punches at Jay and manages to kick off his helmet.)''

'''Onlooker 1''': Who's that?

'''Onlooker 2''': It looks like one of the [[Ninja]]! ''(Jay looks back, confused, when he hears the word.)'' It's Jay!

'''Onlooker 1''': Jay is in ''[[Prime Empire]]''?!

'''Onlooker 2''': He's fighting the Red Visors!

'''Jay''': ''(The Red Visor leaps at Jay but he spins on his left hand, kicking the Visor out, then thrusting himself upward. Another Visor runs at him and Jay grabs his helmet, allowing the Visor's punch follow through into it, then whips the Visor around, throwing him off. He spins sharply and knocks out another approaching Visor.)'' Yah! ''(The Red Visor fighting Scott knocks him down and fires at Jay. Jay holds out the helmet and the fire ricochets back at him, knocking him out. The last Red Visor points his gun at him but Jay bowls him out with his helmet.)''

'''Crowd''': ''(Gasp.)'' Oh! ''(Cheers.)'' Woohoo! Awesome! Yeah!

'''Scott''': ''(He takes off his helmet.)'' Where did you learn to fight like that?

'''Jay''': [[Dance class]]. ''(They both run off.)''

'''Onlooker 1''': That was Jay!

'''Onlooker 2''': That was awesome!

'''Jay''': ''(Scott leads Jay to an empty lot.)'' This is your plan? An empty lot? They'll find us here!

'''Scott''': No. They won't. ''([[Scott's garage|His garage]] appears in the empty space.)''

'''Jay''': Whoa!

'''Scott''': Come on! ''(The doors close as Jay runs in the last second disappears. Three Red Visors appear too late.)''

'''Red Visor''': We have lost the suspect. Report to [[Unagami]].

'''Red Visor 2''': You report to Unagami!
