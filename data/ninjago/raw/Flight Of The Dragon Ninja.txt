''(The episode begins at the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu]], with the four [[ninja]] preparing for another [[Dragons|Dragon]] race as [[Jay]] shows off after the previous day's victory.)''

'''Jay''': Why must we go through this again? I'm clearly the best. I mean, look at me!

'''[[Kai]]''': Impressive, thunder cracker, but may I remind you we all have {{Suit|dragon suits}}. So what's your point?

'''Jay''': Well, I—

'''[[Cole]]''': Jay's only point is that he won last time, so obviously he thinks he'll hold the title of Dragon Master forever.

'''[[Zane]]''': This is highly irrational. We should be training. If [[Wu|Sensei]] finds out—

'''Kai''': Well technically, riding your dragon is kind of training.

''(Kai, Jay, Zane, and Cole race each other riding their dragons, now named [[Flame]], [[Wisp]], [[Shard]], and [[Rocky]] respectively.)''

'''Cole''': So we all agree, whoever wins this one will be the new Dragon Master for a month. Ready?

'''Ninja''': Ninja, go!

''(The race begins. Kai and Zane are shown to be racing neck and neck.)''

'''Zane''': May the best man win!

'''Kai''': See ya!

''(Kai slows down and goes under the clouds.)''

'''Zane''': W-where did he go?

''(As Zane wonders where Kai went, Kai himself goes ahead to distract Zane.)''

'''Kai''': ''(Using Flame to spit out [[Fire]] in Zane's direction.)'' Need a light?! ''(Fortunately, Zane manages to escape the trap.)''

'''Zane''': Woah!

'''Kai''': Hahaha.

'''Zane''': Time to fight Fire with [[Ice]]!

''(Zane goes beside the side of a mountain so that he can use Shard to spit out Ice on Kai and Flame.'')

'''Zane''': ''(Passing by a freezing Kai.)'' Feeling a little ''chilly''?

''(Meanwhile, Cole and Jay are shown racing each other in a forest. As they head towards a tree, Jay manages to dodge it, but Cole goes straight to its direction. Lucky for Cole, Rocky uses his incredible strength to knock the tree down.)''

'''Cole''': Woah! Yeah, Rocky! Way to go!

''(The four ninja now race neck to neck returning to the monastery.)''

'''Cole''': Well, guys. Time to activate the turbo. Eat my dust! ''(Cole uses chicken to make Rocky accelerate faster than the other Dragons.)''

''(As the ninja return to monastery, the [[Postman]] is seen complaining for their disruption in his work.)''

'''Cole''': Way to go, Rocky! We are an awesome team!

'''Kai''': Nice run, bro, but we'll get you tomorrow.

'''Cole''': ''(Confused.)'' Tomorrow? We agreed that the winner was gonna be Dragon Master for a month!

''(Jay laughs silently.)''

'''Zane''': I don't recall agreeing to that.

'''Cole''': Nah-uh!

'''Kai''': Oh, brother!
