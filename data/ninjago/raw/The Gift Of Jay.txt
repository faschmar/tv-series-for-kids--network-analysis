''(In the throne room, [[Mammatus]] and the [[Keepers]] surround the ninja.)''

'''Mammatus''': Lock them up. All but one. The Gift.

'''Keeper''': Which one?

'''[[Jay]]''': Guys, is all this really necessary? All the pushing and the poking and the zapping. Why don't we start over? Ahem. My name's Jay, nice to meet you!

'''Mammatus''': This one.

'''[[Nya]]''': Wait, where are you taking him?

'''[[Kai]]''': Hey!

'''[[Cole]]''': Back off!

'''Nya''': Jay!

'''Kai''': Careful with that thing! ''(The Keepers lock the ninja up.)'' You're making a big mistake!

'''Cole''': Let us out of here! ''(They attempt to lift the door, but a Keeper electrocutes them.)'' Remind me not to try that again.

'''[[Misako]]''': Nya? Kai?

'''Nya''': Misako!

'''Misako''': Are you all okay?

'''Nya''': Yeah, we're okay.

'''Cole''': How about you guys?

'''[[Wu]]''': Yes, we're fine.

'''Misako''': They've treated us pretty well, all in all.

'''[[Clutch Powers|Clutch]]''': I've been in quicksand that was more comfortable. [[Dwayne]]! How's that tunnel coming along?

'''Dwayne''': My hands hurt.

'''Nya''': Why are they doing this? What do they want?

'''Misako''': It has something to do with some [[Storm Amulet|artifact]] they seem to be protecting. I believe they think we were trying to steal it.

'''Cole''': Were you trying to steal it?

'''Clutch''': How dare you! I'm an archeologist, not a thief. ''(Nya and Cole look at him skeptically.)'' I study, and I, uh, bring back. To my place. To study some more.

'''Misako''': Where are [[Lloyd]] and Jay?

'''Kai''': Lloyd managed to get away. He's still out there somewhere. And Jay, they took somewhere else.

'''Wu''': What for?

'''Nya''': We don't know. But I have a terrible feeling something bad is gonna happen to him.

'''[[Zane]]''': They referred to him as a gift. I am unsure why.

'''Misako''': From my observation, the islanders aren't actually hostile, just protective. I don't believe they want to hurt us.

'''Kai''': Hopefully we won't be here long enough to find out. If I know Lloyd, right about now, he's finding a way to rescue us.

''(In a cave, Lloyd puts on camouflage.)''

'''[[Twitchy Tim]]''': What's that for?

'''Lloyd''': Camouflage.

'''Twitchy Tim''': You're going out there? Are you nuts?

'''Lloyd''': I don't have a choice, Twitchy. My friends need me, and I could use all the help I can get.

'''Twitchy Tim''': Oh forget it! Wanna know how I survived on this island for so long? By not taking chances!

'''Lloyd''': Twitchy, I know you're scared. But if we went together, we could rescue the others, find my mom, and get off this island! All we have to do is sneak into their [[Keepers' Village|village]], break them out - Twitchy, are you okay?

'''Twitchy Tim''': What's all that for? Camouflage?

'''Lloyd''': Oh great.

'''Twitchy Tim''': You're going out there? Are you nuts?

'''Lloyd''': Twitchy! I get it. You're been knocked down, a lot. But that doesn't mean you have to stay down. You're stronger than that. ''(He exits the cave, leaving Twitchy Tim behind..)''

''(In a room, Jay paces alone when [[PoulErik]] enters.)''

'''PoulErik''': Food? Drink? Canap√©?

'''Jay''': Okay, what's going on? Why are you being nice to be all of a sudden? Why do you have two heads? And which head do I look at when I'm talking to you?

'''PoulErik''': We brought some food! Just for you. Gift of Jay.

'''Jay''': [[Edna|My mom]] used to call me that! I was her precious little gift.

'''PoulErik''': Please, have a seat. And relax.

'''Jay''': Are you just trying to distract me? Because it won't work - oh, wow, those look delicious. Maybe just one. ''(He reaches for the food, but slaps himself away.)'' Ah! No! I want answers. Where are my friends, and what do you want from us?

'''PoulErik''': Eat, drink, and enjoy. You are a gift.

'''Jay''': Oh, I get it. You saw me use my [[Lightning|elemental powers]] on those [[Stone Guardians|statue brothers]], and now you want me to be your king! Oh, yeah, I'm flattered, but I can't be a king. I mean, I could. I'd be a great king, but I already have a job. I'm a full time ninja. You know, master of Lightning, saving the world, et cetera, et cetera.

''(In the jungle, Lloyd makes his way to the village, but finds that [[Zippy]] had followed him there.)''

'''Lloyd''': Oh, no. Not you again! Shoo, shoo, get, go! ''(Zippy pushes the [[Coconuts|coconut]] at Lloyd, who picks it up and throws it away, then turns around to find Zippy right in front of him with the coconut.)'' How - you were just - ''(He prepares to throw it away again, but catches sight of the Keepers.)'' Hey guys, catch! ''(He uses Zippy as distraction to get to the cells.)''

'''Nya''': Lloyd!

'''Cole''': It's about time.

'''Misako''': Oh, Lloyd.

'''Lloyd''': Mom, Master Wu! Are you okay?

'''Misako''': Fine, fine.

'''Lloyd''': Well, let's get out of here. This place is crawling with islanders. We gotta go quick.

'''Nya''': We can't go anywhere without Jay.

'''Lloyd''': Well, where's Jay?

'''Wu''': We don't know. They took him somewhere else.

'''Lloyd''': Why? Actually, no. We don't have time. Let's just find him. ''(To the explorers)'' You guys head for camp, get the catamarans ready. ''(To the others)'' You check that way, I'll check this way. ''(As they split up, Clutch stays back and pulls Dwayne in another direction.)''

''(As the ninja search the village, Zippy distracts the Keepers and causes chaos. Later, they regroup, but no one has found Jay yet, and Clutch is missing as well.)''

'''Lloyd''': You're kidding. Nothing?

'''Nya''': No sign. And we looked everywhere!

'''Lloyd''': What happened to Clutch?

'''Cole''': Oh, great, now we're missing more people.

'''Kai''': You don't think he'd be foolish enough to go back for that artifact?

'''Nya''': Even Clutch isn't that reckless. Is he?

''(At the throne room, Clutch takes out the Amulet while standing on Dwayne.)''

'''Clutch''': Hold still, Dwayne!

'''Lloyd''': Clutch! Don't!

'''Cole''': Leave it.

'''Clutch''': This is a valuable cultural artifact! It deserves to be studied, at my place.

'''Nya''': We don't have time! Leave it!

'''Zane''': I am inclined to agree. Any second the Keepers are likely to - ''(The Keepers electrocute them.)''

'''Clutch''': Gumdrops.

''(The ninja wake up to find themselves tied on poles on the beach.)''

'''Lloyd''': Oh boy.

'''Nya''': I'm getting a little tired of being zapped.

'''Cole''': ''(Someone throws a spear at Cole's pole, zapping him.)'' Me too.

'''Nya''': ''(The Keepers pass by with Jay on a palanquin.)'' Jay!

'''Jay''': Nya! Master Wu!

'''Lloyd''': Where are they taking you?

'''Jay''': I have no idea! But it's okay. They don't wanna hurt me, they want me to be their king! They keep calling me "Gift of Jay" and giving me things.

'''Nya''': Uh, then why are your hands tied up? That makes no sense!

'''Cole''': Well, since you're on such friendly terms, could you maybe get them to let us go?

'''Kai''': And tell them to stop zapping us!

'''Jay''': Oh, good idea! I'll try. Ahem. Guys? Okay, Gift of Jay wants you to untie his friends, okay?

'''Lloyd''': Why are they putting you on a raft?

'''Misako''': I don't think they want to give you anything, Jay. I think you're the gift.

'''Jay''': Me? No, how can I be a gift?

'''Kai''': Yeah. Who'd want Jay?

'''Nya''': Um, me?

'''Mammatus''': Keepers, hear me! ''(He realizes that the Keepers cannot see him, so his servant gives him a stool, which he stands on.)'' Ahem. Long before time had a name, we were charged with protecting this world from the wrath of [[Wojira]].

'''Keepers''': Wojira!

'''Lloyd''': Wojira?

'''Misako''': An ancient myth, a storm spirit. Some cultures believe it was a giant serpent.

'''Mammatus''': For countless generations, we have fulfilled our duty as the [[First Spinjitzu Master]] tasked us. ''(Wu gasps.)'' Now, for reasons we know not, Wojira awakens. Wojira rises! So we send her this gift, the Gift of Jay!

'''Keepers''': Wojira!

'''Mammatus''': To placate her anger, we pray Wojira will take this gift, and go back to sleep.

'''Jay''': Uh, guys? Come on, this isn't funny!

'''Nya''': Jay? Jay, hold on!

'''Lloyd''': Let us go!

'''Cole''': You're making a huge mistake!

'''Jay''': We're friends, remember? I'm Gift of Jay!

'''Clutch''': Guys, relax. This whole Wojira thing, it's a myth! It's not real.

'''Jay''': Whoa! What's that? Guys? Guys? There's something out here. There's something big out here! Aah!

'''Kai''': I guess someone did want Jay.
