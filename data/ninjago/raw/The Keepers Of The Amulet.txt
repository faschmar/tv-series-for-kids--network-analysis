''(The ninja race through the jungle. [[Lloyd]] notices something above them and stops.)''

'''[[Nya]]''': What's wrong?

'''Lloyd''': I thought I saw something up there. An animal.

'''[[Jay]]''': We're in the jungle, Lloyd. I'm sure there's lots of animals.

'''[[Cole]]''': Hey, did anyone bring a snack? I'm starving.

'''Jay''': I did.

'''Cole''': Great!

'''Jay''': But it fell in the [[Endless Sea|ocean]].

'''Cole''': Oh, thanks for getting my hopes up.

'''Lloyd''': What kind of animals are there on [[Island of the Keepers|this island]], [[Twitchy Tim|Twitchy]]?

'''Twitchy Tim''': Uh, poisonous pythons, poisonous jaguars, poisonous frogs, poisonous eels, poisonous piranhas, poisonous birds!

'''Nya''': Poisonous birds?

'''Twitchy Tim''': Pretty much everything on this island is poisonous! Especially those berries. ''(He points at Cole, who is eating some berries.)''

'''Lloyd''': Whatever is on this island, it won't stop us from finding my [[Misako|mom]] and Master [[Wu]].

'''Nya''': And [[Clutch Powers]].

'''Lloyd''': Huh? Oh yeah, right. And Clutch. ''(The ninja ride for some distance, then stop again.)'' Let's leave the Jungle Choppers here. There's no way we're gonna drive through that.

'''[[Kai]]''': ''(He hears a loud growl.)'' Ha, you weren't kidding. You really are hungry. I can hear your stomach growling from here.

'''Cole''': Uh, that wasn't my stomach.

'''Kai''': Well, if it wasn't your stomach, then who's - ''(They hear even louder growling. Twitchy Tim curls into a ball on the ground.)''

'''Lloyd''': What are you doing?

'''Twitchy Tim''': Assuming survival position!

''(A [[Coconuts|coconut]] drops in front of Nya, followed by a [[Zippy|dragon]], who pins her to the ground.)''

'''Nya''': Dragon!

'''Kai''': Ninja, -

'''Nya''': No, wait! Look at him. I don't think he's dangerous.

'''Cole''': ''(The dragon tosses the coconut his way.)'' Is that a coconut? ''(The dragon swipes the coconut away.)'' Aww.

'''Nya''': I think he wants to play! Fetch! ''(She throws the coconut into the jungle.)''

'''[[Zane]]''': He appears quite docile.

'''Lloyd''': Yeah, look, it might be friendly and all, but -

'''Jay''': Zippy! Oh, let's call him Zippy!

'''Lloyd''': Okay. Zippy might be friendly and all, but we don't have time to be playing fetch with dragons. We're trying to find my mom and Master Wu.

'''Nya''': Are you sure? He's so cute! Okay, fine. Zippy, look. You're a real good boy, but we're on an important mission, and you might be a little huge and loud for us, okay? Super fetch! ''(She propels the coconut deep into the jungle with [[water]], and Zippy bounds after it.)''

'''Twitchy Tim''': Survival mode successful again!

'''Lloyd''': Let's go, quick!

''(While slicing through vines, the coconut lands on Kai's sword. He walks over to Cole.)''

'''Kai''': Ahem.

'''Cole''': Yes! Finally! What?

'''Kai''': Is it possible for you to think about anything except food?

'''Cole''': Yes. I'm thirsty too. ''(Zippy takes the coconut away.)'' Give me back my drink, thief! Hey! Aah! ''(Zippy licks him.)'' Ew! You can keep it.

'''Zane''': This is most strange.

'''Cole''': What's wrong?

'''Zane''': The trail appears to stop here. I see evidence of a struggle.

'''Lloyd''': What kind of struggle? ''(They unveil a [[Stone Guardians|Stone Guardian]].)''

'''Twitchy Tim''': Survival mode!

'''Nya''': Will you guys relax? ''(She taps it with a stick.)'' It's just a statue! See? ''(The Golem bites her stick.)'' Aah!

'''Kai''': Uh, the statue has brothers!

'''Lloyd''': Ninja, go!

'''Cole''': ''(He attempts to use his [[Earth|elemental powers]] on a Golem, but it absorbs it and sends it back at him.)'' What?

'''Kai''': It just ate my fire blast and spat it back!

'''Zane''': They appear to be channeling our elemental energy! ''(Jay charges up his [[lightning]].)'' Jay, do not use your -

''(Jay screams as he runs from a Guardian's lightning blasts.)''

'''Twitchy Tim''': Escape maneuvers! ''(He crawls away from the action.)''

''(The Golems stack up and channel the lightning from the sky, then blast it at the ninja.)''

'''Kai''': I don't think lightning's only your thing anymore!

'''Jay''': Yeah! I know!

'''Lloyd''': Look out!

''(The ninja run from the Guardians. Lloyd is forced to separate from the others.)''

'''Nya''': Oh no. Where's Lloyd?

'''Jay''': And the other guy. Oh what'd he say, Nutty Ned?

'''Nya''': Twitchy Tim! Aah! ''(She screams as she nearly falls off a cliff.)''

'''Jay''': ''(He accidentally knocks Nya over the cliff, but catches her in time.)'' Nya!

'''Kai''': They're still coming. What now?

'''Nya''': Look. There! ''(She points at a rope bridge.)''

'''Jay''': Are you kidding? A rope bridge? Rope bridges always break, and we'll be barely holding on, dangling over certain doom!

'''Zane''': Admittedly, that does happen to us more frequently than standard statistical models would suggest. Still, I evaluate it to be a risk worth taking. ''(He runs across the bridge.)''

'''Jay''': Oh, I'm gonna regret this!

'''Nya''': Keep moving, Jay!

'''Jay''': It's gonna fall, it's gonna fall, it's gonna fall, it's gonna fall! ''(He walks across with his eyes closed.)''

'''Cole''': Maybe open your eyes now.

'''Jay''': Haha! No way! We actually made it all the way across a rope bridge without it breaking! Haha! I guess everything's gonna be - ''(the bridge breaks)'' see? I told you! What was that noise?

'''Zane''': It sounded like some form of electric - ''(He is electrocuted.)''

'''Jay''': Zane? Zane? Nya? Kai? Cole? ''(He is electrocuted as well.)''

''(In the jungle, Lloyd is still running from the Golems. He hides in a cave and tricks the Golems into leaving.)''

'''Lloyd''': Huh, well, running away isn't usually my style, but I guess it was my only choice.

'''Twitchy Tim''': Really? Because running away is almost always my first choice. ''(Lloyd sighs.)''

''(Nya wakes up on a [[Battle catamarans|catamaran]].)''

'''Nya''': Huh?

'''Kai''': Hey, untie me!

'''Nya''': Kai? Are you okay?

'''Kai''': Nya! Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Where are they taking us? Can you see anything?

'''Nya''': I have no idea. I can't see a thing.

'''Jay''': ''(A [[Rumble Keepers|Rumble Keeper]] zaps Jay.)'' Hey! Watch it with that! Ow! Okay, I'm going, I'm going!

'''Nya''': What do you want? Why did you attack us?

'''[[Mammatus]]''': Silence! I know why you are here. Like those who came before you, you seek to steal the [[Storm Amulet|amulet]].

'''Kai''': We're not here to steal anything. We're here to rescue our friends.

'''Mammatus''': You do not deceive me. Others have come before you. Others have tried, and failed, for we uphold our vow. We are the [[Keepers|Keepers of the Amulet]]!

'''Jay''': What amulet?

''(Mammatus reveals an amulet.)''

'''Cole''': I'm guessing that one.

'''Mammatus''': It is the Storm Amulet, pried from the head of the sleeper in the deep, she who existed long before time had a name. [[Wojira]]!

'''Keepers''': Wojira!

'''Mammatus''': We took a sacred oath to keep the Storm Amulet safe from those who would seize it. We harnessed the power of lightning, and became one with the storm. Our forefathers kept the oath, and their forefathers, all the way back to the beginning.

'''Zane''': I can assure you, we have no intention of purloining your artifact.

'''Mammatus''': You have seen it. You know too much.

'''Jay''': But then why did you show it to us?

'''Mammatus''': There is only one way to ensure it remains safe now.

'''Cole''': Why do I feel like I'm not gonna like this?

'''Mammatus''': You will be our prisoners, forever!

'''Keepers''': Wojira!

'''Cole''': Yeah, I don't like it.
