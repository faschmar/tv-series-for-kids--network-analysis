'''[[Jay]] and [[Nya]]''': Hey!

'''Nya''': Welcome back to our second...

'''Jay and Nya''': Ninja Vlog!

----

'''Nya''': This week, we'll be taking take our first steps on the [[Island of the Keepers|unexplored island]].

'''Jay''': But first we're seeing which vehicle they voted for in my brilliant [[LEGO Life]] poll. Nya, the results, please.

'''Nya''': Um, Jay?

'''Jay''': What?

'''Nya''': I think you uploaded the wrong image, because this is one of the vehicles you uploaded.

'''Jay''': Is that a [[Chickens|chicken]]?

'''Nya''': I'm pretty sure.

'''Jay''': Oh, no! Look how many people commented on it!

'''Nya''': Jay, I'm sure it's not even that bad.

'''Jay''': And people even voted for it!

'''Nya''': Well, uh, this user kinda has a good point. Maybe it's a lightning-proof chicken. Plus it can fly.

'''Jay''': Lightning-proof chicken? This is a disaster! This is my first ever LEGO Life poll!

'''Nya''': Jay, at least it seems like people—

'''Jay''': Oh, and they're calling themselves the Chicken Squad now!

'''Nya''': Okay. I think we'll see you guys on the island, and I'll guess we'll take the [[ninja's catamarans|catamaran]].

'''Jay''': Okay.

'''Nya''': Chicken Squad out!

'''Jay''': What? No!

----

''(They are both at the island with their catamaran.)''

'''Nya''': Now that was a rough ride.

'''Jay''': ''(Groans.)'' You can say that again. I thought we were goners after we couldn't get our catamaran to narrow. I wonder why the mechanism broke.

'''Nya''': Wow, look at this place! The sand really is blue, just like [[Twitchy Tim|Twitchy]] said.

'''Jay''': ''(He continuously bangs on the mechanism.)'' Why! Won't! You! Work?!

'''Nya''': And that's a shield from the ancient civilization. Except, I don't think it's been lying here very long. Does that mean people are still living here?

'''Jay''': Oh, Nya! It's this button! ''(He presses it and one of the catamaran's spring-shooters fire.)'' Whoa—

'''Jay''': That's it! What with the jagged sea rocks, the broken catamaran...

'''Nya''': The lightning-proof chicken.

'''Jay''': The lightning-proof chicken and now this! This island has ''definitely'' lost a star in my travel wild review I'm writing. Hey, what's that?

----

'''Nya''': So it looks like we found another [[Battle catamarans|catamaran]].

'''Jay''': It's amazing!

'''Nya''': But I wonder who built it.

'''Jay''': Hey, Nya, look. These rods look like they're designed to attract the lightning?

'''Nya''': But that's crazy! Our catamarans are meant to shield it from lightning.

'''Jay''': Maybe it's a technology we don't know about or... ''(A roar is heard.)'' What was that? What was that? W-What was that?

'''Nya''': Well, it sounded a teeny, tiny bit like a huge, scary roar. Well, let's go.

----

''(They return to their [[Destiny's Bounty|ship]].)''

'''Nya''': What a start to our expedition.

'''Jay''': Yeah, well, just before we go, we put a brand, new building challenge for you all on LEGO Life.

'''Nya''': We want you to build an exploration vehicle that we can use to navigate this island's jungles and mountains.

'''Jay''': Head over to LEGO Life to find out more!

'''Nya''': We'll feature our favorites on the next... ''(They break up, unsynchronized.)''

'''Nya''': And we'll feature our favorites on the next

'''Jay and Nya''': Ninja Vlog! Bye!

----

'''Jay''': I think that was good.

'''Nya''': I agree. Ooh, what's for dinner?

'''Jay''': Oh, well, I was planning on eating...

'''Nya''': Yeah?

'''Jay''': Chicken?

''(They both chuckle as a chicken squawks in the background.)''
