''(In [[Ninjago City]], [[Sammy]] is making an announcement.)''

'''Sammy''': Hey, listen up. Announcements. Oh, what do you know? All the routes are open. That's a first. But uh, [[Spokes]] and [[Knuckles]] are still on trauma leave, and [[Jonesy]]'s bike is in the shop, so we're a couple of hands short. Oh, and uh, this is [[Antonia]]'s last day, so get your goodbyes in.

'''[[Leroy]]''': What?

'''Paperboy 2''': He's joking. Right, Ton?

'''[[Nelson]]''': Yeah, Antonia ain't a quitter.

'''Antonia''': It ain't a joke. I got something new lined up. What'd you think, I was gonna be a papergirl my whole life? I got a job at the [[Dairy Dragon]].

'''Leroy''': That ice cream shop downtown?

'''Paperboy 2''': They got great ice cream.

'''Sammy''': All right, come on. Stow the jabber and hit the road. These [[Ninjago City News|papers]] ain't delivering themselves!

'''Nelson''': Antonia? You can't quit! You're the one who taught me that the news never sleeps, remember?

'''Antonia''': Maybe not, but I woke up. I'm gonna make more off the tip jar of Dairy Dragon than I will all week here. ''(She rides off.)''

'''Nelson''': Hey, wait! Antonia! ''(He chases after her.)'' Antonia! Wait up! Antonia! What about all that stuff you said, about how the news is so important? How we're making a difference?

'''Antonia''': I was wrong, okay? Look around! Every day gets crazier. If it ain't [[Elemental Cobras|giant snakes]], it's a [[Empire Dragon|dragon]] or some [[Unagami|evil video game]]. ''(Unagami catches a newspaper from a balcony and waves.)''

'''Nelson''': There's nothing today. Everything's fine! See? ''(Just then, [[Merlopians]] start attacking the city.)''

'''[[Gripe]]''': In the name of King [[Kalmaar]] of [[Merlopia]], surrender and perish!

'''Policeman 1''': Uh, did he say surrender ''and'' perish?

'''[[Jimmy]]''': That's not much of a choice.

'''Nelson''': So it's not perfect. But that doesn't mean we give up!

'''Antonia''': If we're not making a difference, what's the point? Might as well take a job that pays better.

'''Nelson''': It's about ''not'' giving up, even when you lose.

'''Antonia''': Who told you that piece of cheerful advice?

'''Nelson''': It's true!

'''Antonia''': Well, I have my own saying. If you can't win, quit and join the Dairy Dragon.

''(Later, Nelson and Antonia eat their lunch together at their usual spot.)''

'''Nelson''': What flavors do they have at the Dairy Dragon?

'''Antonia''': Chocolate fudge, butter pecan, mint chocolate chip, ninjapolitan, Bananakhan, cookies and cream, Spinjitzu Swirl, vanilla, Mango Morro, and orange sorbentine.

'''Nelson''': I love Banadakhan. What am I talking about? You're quitting, Antonia. That's it. Plain and simple.

'''Antonia''': Yeah, I know. We just talked about that through the whole merman invasion back there. And you know what? I'm okay with quitting.

'''Nelson''': Well, if that's how you feel, I guess there's nothing I can say. ''(He leaves.)''

'''Antonia''': Hey, come on. Nelson! Don't be like that. Ugh. ''(She chases after him.)'' Nelson, will you listen? You're gonna be fine without me. Hey, come on. Did you think about the upside?

'''Nelson''': What upside?

'''Antonia''': Having a friend at the Dairy Dragon, I can hook you up with all the Banadakhan you can imagine! What do you say? Still friends?

'''Nelson''': Yeah, I guess. Still -- ''(As they pass the [[Explorer's Club]], Kalmaar blasts his way out with the [[Storm Amulet]].)''

'''[[Kai]]''': Hey, Tentacles! ''(He and the others engage Kalmaar. The amulet lands at Antonia's and Nelson's feet, while [[Wu]] is hit by Kalmaar.)''

'''[[Cole]]''': Master Wu! Ninja, go! ''(He attacks Kalmaar with Spinjitzu. While fighting, Kai is hit as well and blasted against a car.)''

'''[[Ray]]''': Kai! ''(He attacks Kalmaar, but is easily defeated and thrown at Kai.)'' Ouch. Oh man. I don't remember it hurting this much.

'''Kai''': Ugh, me neither.

'''Kalmaar''': ''(To Antonia)'' You! Girl! Bring me that amulet, now!

'''Kai''': Don't -- let him get it, kid!

''(Antonia picks up the amulet and leaves with Nelson.)''

'''Wu''': Go, kids. Go!

'''Nelson''': Who are those guys?

'''Antonia''': Beats me! I ain't sticking around to find out!

''(Kalmaar jumps on several vehicles to pursue them, including one with the driver listening to [[The Weekend Whip]]. Nelson and Antonia are surrounded on a bridge.)''

'''Kalmaar''': I believe you have something that belongs to me. Hand it over, or face the consequences.

'''Antonia''': See? This is what you get for sticking your neck out. Now what are we supposed to do?

'''Nelson''': ''(He looks at the side of the bridge.)'' All right. Come on!

'''Antonia''': I'm really regretting I taught you this stuff!

'''Nelson''': Too late to worry about it now. ''(He and Antonia ride off the side of the bridge.)''

'''Kalmaar''': Stop them!

'''Nelson''': Oh no! ''(They manage to get down to the main roads safely.)''

'''Kalmaar''': I quite dislike that child. ''(He leaps onto a [[Garbage trucks|garbage truck]], flings the driver onto some trash bags, and attempts to drive it.)'' Well, you're a tricky beast, aren't you? There we go.

'''Nelson''': You've got to be kidding me!

'''Antonia''': This way!

''(Kai leaps onto Kalmaar's truck and kicks him out.)''

'''Kai''': Remember me?

'''Kalmaar''': Of course I remember you, I saw you just five minutes ago in the street!

'''Kai''': That was sarcasm, which I guess they don't have wherever you're from!

''(Nelson and Antonia turn a corner, passing by a wall with [[Fugi-Dove|Fugibuff]] on it. A bridge opens, and while they are able to make it across safely, Kai and Kalmaar crash into the water.)''

'''Nelson''': What do we do?

'''Antonia''': Maybe I should -- ''(Suddenly, Kalmaar emerges. He snatches the amulet and points his [[Kalmaar's trident|trident]] at Antonia.)''

'''Kalmaar''': What is your name?

'''Antonia''': Antonia.

'''Kalmaar''': Are you, a ninja?

'''Antonia''': No.

'''Kalmaar''': An [[Elemental Masters|Elemental Master]]?

'''Antonia''': Nope.

'''Kalmaar''': A mystic?

'''Antonia''': Uh uh.

'''Kalmaar''': An [[Oni]]?

'''Antonia''': Not even close.

'''Kalmaar''': [[Serpentine]]?

'''Antonia''': Ew.

'''Kalmaar''': [[Vermillion]]?

'''Antonia''': No, I -- I'm just a papergirl.

'''Kalmaar''': Paper, girl?

'''Nelson''': We deliver newspapers?

'''Kalmaar''': A papergirl! Oh, how amusing! ''(He starts laughing.)''

'''Antonia''': What's so funny?

'''Kalmaar''': Of all my foes, of all those who have tried to stop me, you, a common papergirl, came the closest. Perhaps I have underestimated your loathsome [[Humans|species]]. ''(He leaps into the water and leaves.)''

'''Nelson''': Kai's still down there! ''(Antonia dives into the water.)'' Come on, Antonia! ''(She emerges with Kai in tow.)'' Antonia!

'''Antonia''': He's not breathing.

'''Nelson''': Okay. Step back, Antonia. I know CPR. ''(He does CPR until Kai sits back up, coughing. Just then, Wu and the others arrive.)''

'''Wu''': Kai, what happened? Are you okay?

'''Kai''': I'm fine. But Tentacles, he -- he got away.

'''Nelson''': He went that way.

'''Antonia''': We tried to stop him. We really did, but we weren't fast enough. He got that round thing. I'm really sorry.

'''Wu''': Oh, child, you did all you could. And we thank you for it.

'''Cole''': Yeah. The important thing is you were here.

'''Kai''': If you hadn't been, I might still be at the bottom of that canal.

'''Wu''': Come. There isn't a moment to lose. Perhaps we can still catch them. ''(They leave.)''

''(Later, Nelson and Antonia arrive at a crossroads.)''

'''Nelson''': Well, so long.

'''Antonia''': So long.

'''Nelson''': Good luck at the Dairy Dragon. Maybe I'll swing by tomorrow and --

'''Antonia''': Oh, save it, Nelson. I'm not going anywhere. ''(Nelson looks surprised.)'' I changed my mind, okay? I got a right to change my mind, don't I?

'''Nelson''': You mean, you're gonna stay?

'''Antonia''': Yeah. I'm gonna stay. But only if you promise not to rub my nose in it. In fact, don't say anything. Just say "Okay, Antonia. I'll see you tomorrow." ''(She rides off.)''

'''Nelson''': Okay, Antonia. I'll see you tomorrow.

'''Antonia''': See you around, purple ninja.
