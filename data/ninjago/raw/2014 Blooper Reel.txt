(Intro)

'''Narrator''': What you are about to see is exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the incredible voice talents on the hit TV series [[Ninjago]]. Watch and listen to the amazing and dedicated actors bring life to the wonderful [[LEGO]] characters.

(''[[Hello My Baby]] theme music plays.'')

'''Kai Smith''': Seriously, [[Michael Donovan|Donovan]]? Ugh. 6 a.m. and you're making us climb this thing?

'''Michael Donovan''': Yeah, sorry guys, we just have one mic so you're all gonna have to share. Sorry. So, okay gang, are we ready?

'''Kai Smith''': Does it sound like we're ready? I'm trying to catch my breath here. ''(panting)''

'''Jay Walker''': I'm ready.

'''Kai Smith''': Of course you're ready.

'''Zane Roberts''': I'm ready too.

'''Cole Bucket''': Yeah, totally ready to roll!

'''Kai Smith''': ''(panting)'' Okay, yeah well, don't let me stop you, okay?

'''Michael Donovan''': Uh, actually, [[Kai]], we can still hear you pretty heavy on the mic. If-if you need a moment, I mean-

'''Kai Smith''': Thanks. You're a peach.

----

'''Tommy Wu''': La-la-la-la-la, hit the tongue. Ladidee-ladidee! Twin track tape recorder - give it a tongue, ladidee-ladidee.

'''Marmaduke Wellington''': Being the two seniors on the program, we have a duty. ''(Nudges Tommy)'' Teach the younger actors about discipline, dedication! I for one leave that, in order to play a character, one must become a character. ''(Accidentally hits Tommy)''

'''Tommy Wu''': Well, you're certainly a character. ''(Pulls and lets go of one of Marmaduke Wellington's plastic arms)

'''Marmaduke Wellington''': And what was that supposed to mean?

'''Tommy Wu''': Oh, brother. I can't work like this.

----

'''Michael Donovan''': Okay. Reaction sounds, take one.

'''Jay Walker''': (Imitates fighting with [[nunchucks]], accidently hitting himself). Ugh!

'''Cole Bucket''': Augh!

''(Jay Walker falls to the ground.)''

----

'''Tommy Wu''': You must do everything in your power to stop the [[Great Devourer]]. Go, [[ninja]]. Go!

'''Michael Donovan''': Boom! A massive snake shoots out, swallowing Sensei whole!

'''Marmaduke Wellington''': ''(sighs)'' Who writes this stuff?

'''Tommy Wu''': Please, it's okay.

'''Marmaduke Wellington''': No, it's preposterous! It's ludicrous! Did you know he used to Arthur Miller, Beckett?! Shakespeare?!

'''Tommy Wu''': And now I've been swallowed whole by a giant snake. Huh.

----

'''Michael Donovan''': Okay, this is take 29, and....action!

'''Kai Smith''': Fikkity-fikkity-fikkity fik fi-yah!

'''Cole Bucket''': Look out, don't go there!

'''Jay Walker''': Haha! ''(showing off his bottom)'' Here comes the dummy!

'''Zane Roberts''': ''(slides on his knees)'' No!!!!!!

'''Michael Donovan''': And, cut! Oh, great guys, that was really really nice, I loved it!

----

'''Michael Donovan''': Reaction sounds take two, uh, and remember, you're just chopping vegetables.

'''Jamie Olive''': Uh, okay. Just chopping?

'''Michael Donovan''': Yep. ''(shrugs)'' Just chopping vegetables.

'''Jamie Olive''': Oh, okay! Here we go! ''(takes out two knifes and does acrobatic moves, scaring them all)''

'''Michael Donovan''': Uh, Okay! ''(nervous laughing)''

----

'''Nya Smith''': All right, let's do this!

'''Kai Smith''': You're not even tired?! Not even the slightest?

'''Nya Smith''': Course not. I'm a professional.

''(Lloyd Green joins in)''

'''Lloyd Green''': Sorry I'm late, guys. Had I known they were gonna put me in a life-sized trailer, I would have given myself more time to get here. ''(Lloyd takes off his hat, and the ninja actors laugh)'' What? Wh-what's up?

'''Kai Smith''': You forgot you hair!

'''Lloyd Green''': ''(realizes)'' Daurgh!

----

'''Michael Donovan''': Okay, reaction sounds, take three. Hence, when you're ready.

'''Tommy Wu''': ''(practices using his [[Bo staff|staff]] when Marmaduke's script falls in front of Tommy. As he tries to pick it up, he gets hit several times by Tommy)'' Was that okay?

'''Michael Donovan''': ''(unsure)'' That? Oh, that was so fabulous.

----

'''Kai Smith''': Wait a minute. It says here, Lloyd's the [[Green Ninja]]?!

'''Lloyd Green''': Is this for real?

'''Michael Donovan''': Yeah, writers changed it last minute, you know, thought it to be a better surprise.

'''Lloyd Green''': Ha-ha, cool!

'''Jay Walker''': ''(angrily)'' Uh, not cool! What am I, chopped liver? My contract clearly states I was gonna be the lead actor in this series, okay?

----

'''Michael Donovan''': Reaction sounds, take four.

'''Cole Bucket''': Ninja, go! ''(spins until he falls off the chair and breaks his legs off)'' Ugh, I'm okay. Just give me a minute.

----

'''Lloyd Green''': ({{Soundtrack|Green Ninja theme}} plays. A mic hovers over Lloyd and begins poking him). You took me in. Showed me the importance of being brave, the importance of being strong. And most importantly, being good. When this battle first began long before us-when the [[First Spinjitzu Master]] fought-okay, very funny! ''(the ninja actors laugh, revealing Kai holding the mic)''

----

'''Michael Donovan''': Okay, guys, it's the last take of the day. And remember now, I want to hear that sweet, sweet voice. 

'''The Mega Ultra Dragon Quartet''': (''[[Cole's Song|Singing]]'') Who's gonna save [[Ninjago]]'s hide? Who's gonna make a dad, swell with pride? [[Cole]] is, Cole does, Cole, Cole, Cole.

'''Michael Donovan''': Thanks, guys! That's a wrap.
