''(Near a [[Farmers' village|village]], some [[Rice farmers|farmers]] are tending to their crops. Some trucks screech to a halt near them, and some [[henchmen]] get off. One of them knocks on the back of a truck.)''

'''Henchman #1''': All clear, boss! ''(gets smacked by the opening truck doors)''

'''[[Miss Demeanor]]''': ''(blows a bubble of gum before it pops and she jumps out)'' What am I doing out here? Ah, I hate the country. I'm a city girl. New rule! From now on, we only commit crimes in the [[Ninjago City|city]]! Unless they pay triple.

'''Henchman #1''': Uh, they ''are'' paying triple, Mrs. Demeanor.

'''Miss Demeanor''': It's not Mrs. Demeanor, it's ''Miss'' Demeanor! ''(She fires her flamethrower at her henchman.)'' How many times do I have to say it?

'''Henchman #1''': Sorry, ''Miss'' Demeanor.

'''Miss Demeanor''': Why'd they want to meet out here anyway? We're in the middle of nowhere!

'''Henchman #2''': Probably so those nosy [[ninja]] don't find us.

'''[[Lloyd]]''': Too late for that! ''(He, [[Kai]], and [[Jay]] dramatically reveal themselves.)''

'''Henchman #1''': The ninja!

'''Miss Demeanor''': Ooh, I've been waiting for this! I've worked ''so'' hard to make it to the top. And it's actually happening! Oh, wait, wait, wait, I had a line for this. Oh yeah, I've got a warm welcome planned! ''(She fires her flamethrowers at them.)'' Get the trucks out of here. You four, get the ninja!

'''Jay''': I don't get it. Why do we fight common thugs so often?

'''Miss Demeanor''': So long, boys! I hope our paths cross again! ''(She laughs as she gets away, but [[Cole]] appears in front of her.)''

'''Cole''': How's this? Too soon? ''(He fires at the trucks, two of which are disabled. Miss Demeanor fires at him, knocking his dirt bike over, then drives past him.)''

'''Miss Demeanor''': ''(laughing)'' Nice try, ninja! You almost had me!

'''Cole''': ''(He looks down to see [[Vengestone]] on the ground.)'' Vengestone?

'''Lloyd''': [[Nya]], [[Zane]], they're headed your way. Cut them off. We'll catch up.

'''Nya''': We're on it.

'''Miss Demeanor''': ''(She sees Nya and Zane trying to cut her off.)'' Faster, go faster! They're trying to cut us off!

'''Henchman''': Yes, Miss Demeanor.

'''Lloyd''': Nya, need a little [[water]] power.

'''Nya''': I'm on it.

'''Lloyd''': Zane, get ready. As soon as Nya douses the truck, flash freeze everything!

'''Zane''': Affirmative.

'''Nya''': Here goes! ''(She summons a water tornado but it spirals out of control.)''

'''Lloyd''': Now! Hit the truck! ''(The tornado goes around the truck.)'' Nya, drop it on the truck!

'''Nya''': I'm trying. It's not obeying!

'''Miss Demeanor''': Ha! She's lost control! That's embarrassing.

'''Zane''': Nya! ''(He leaps and pushes her out of the way just as the tornado comes their way.)''

'''Miss Demeanor''': Get your act together! I'm doing my part. Am I the only professional?

'''Jay''': They're getting away!

'''Lloyd''': I know, but I think we have bigger problems.

'''Zane''': ''(He tries to freeze the tornado.)'' I - I can't hold it! ''(The tornado breaks free.)''

'''Lloyd''': Look out! ''(They all leap out of the way.)'' Nya, just drop the water back down!

'''Nya''': I'm trying! Nothing's working!

'''Cole''': What do we do? There's a village full of farmers over there!

'''Lloyd''': Evacuate the village. If this much water comes down on top of them, someone might get hurt. ''(They rush towards the village.)'' Nice and calm, everyone. There's no reason for concern. Just keep moving.

'''Jay''': Right this way!

'''Zane''': Come along, child.

'''Child''': I want to stay and see the water.

'''Zane''': I'm afraid that would be very dangerous.

'''Child''': It's okay, I'm a [[Nindroid]] like you. ''(Gets picked up and put over Zane's shoulder as he runs)'' Beep, boop, bop!

'''Zane''': I do not speak like that.

'''Lloyd''': Run! ''(He barely escapes the flood caused by the tornado, and everyone is drenched.)''

'''Child''': Beep, boop, bop.

'''Zane''': Beep, boop, bop.

''(They look down at the flooded village, with a chicken landing in Jay's arms and Nya looking away uncomfortably.''

----

''(Back at the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu|Monastery]], [[Wu]] questions the ninja about their mission.)''

'''Wu''': What was in the trucks?

'''Cole''': Vengestone.

'''Lloyd''': A huge shipment, three trucks worth.

'''Wu''': Hmm. Very peculiar. Vengestone has few practical uses. Why would anyone be smuggling Vengestone?

'''Lloyd''': We don't know. The criminal called herself Miss Demeanor, but she got away before we could ask her.

'''Wu''': You let her escape?

'''Kai''': We didn't exactly ... let her.

'''Zane''': We were forced to contend with ... unexpected complications.

'''Wu''': What complications?

'''Nya''': It was me, okay? It was me. Just saying. I messed ''everything'' up. I had a teensy tiny little momentary loss of control, and I kind of created a small tidal wave.

'''Wu''': How?

'''Nya''': I don't know how! Okay? Can we change the subject?

'''Lloyd''': Nya, it was a hundred foot tall tornado of water.

'''Nya''': We've all made mistakes! It's no big deal. It won't happen again, okay?

'''Cole''': Okay.

'''Lloyd''': Yeah, okay.

'''Jay''': Right!

'''Zane''': Affirmative.

'''Nya''': Good! ''(As she turns to walk away, the sprinklers activate and the computer malfunctions.)''

'''Jay''': Oh no, the sprinklers! ''(They all turn to look at Nya.)''
----''(The ninja and Wu gather in the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu/Rooms#Library|library]].)''

'''Wu''': Just as I thought. This is a complete list of the elemental powers, but there is no mention of Water, or [[Wind]].

'''Cole''': What does that mean?

'''Wu''': My father, the [[First Spinjitzu Master]], used to tell me an old fairy tale about how he mastered all of the elemental powers, but never Wind or Water.

'''Lloyd''': Why not?

'''Wu''': He said those were not his to command. They belonged to someone else. To [[Wojira]].

'''Zane''': Wojira. That name is familiar to us. If my database is correct, it was a storm spirit of some kind.

'''Wu''': Wojira commanded the elements of Water and Wind. When combined, they became a force of destruction, the [[Fury of the Storm]].

'''Lloyd''': That's Wojira?

'''Wu''': I believe so.

'''Cole''': What does it say?

'''Wu''': Very little, I'm afraid. It says here that the First Spinjitzu Master conquered her with the help of the [[Merlopians]].

'''Zane''': I have no mention of the word "Merlopian" in any of my databases.

'''Wu''': They were a sea folk. They lived here before my father came, but there is little else known about them. ''(He picks up a magnifying glass.)'' In the midst of the [[Battle of Nine Days|battle]], a [[Nyad|Merlopian warrior]] with a trident and a helmet rose from the depths of the great ocean, and pried from the great serpent's head [[Amulets of Wojira|two amulets]]: an [[Storm Amulet|amulet]] of [[Storm]], and an [[Wave Amulet|amulet]] of [[Wave]]. And the seas grew calm, and the great serpent fell into a deep slumber.

'''Lloyd''': An amulet of Storm. Like the one on the [[Island of the Keepers|Island]] of the [[Keepers]]?

'''Jay''': So Nya's powers are linked to Wojira? Or these amulets?

'''Wu''': It's possible. I don't know. We need to find someone who does.

'''Zane''': Who?

'''Wu''': ''(To Kai)'' What about [[Maya|your mother]]? She was the elemental master of water before Nya. She might be able to help Nya regain control of her powers.

'''Kai''': ''(sighs)'' Nya and Mom aren't that close. They hardly know each other. Our parents were gone most of our childhood.

'''Zane''': They were imprisoned by [[Krux]].

'''Cole''': Yeah, you can't exactly blame them.

'''Kai''': I don't. But it doesn't change the fact that we grew up on our own. Nya is pretty independent, in case you haven't noticed.

'''Lloyd''': Uh ...

'''Jay''': Yeah!

'''Zane''': This is a fact.

'''Wu''': I'm sure that she will understand. Nya is reasonable.
----''(Out in the courtyard, Nya trains furiously.)''

'''Kai''': Hey, sis.

'''Nya''': What's up, Kai?

'''Kai''': Oh, nothing. Say now, I was just talking to Master Wu, about your little problem, and he had an interesting idea.

'''Nya''': What interesting idea?

'''Kai''': ''(Nervously.)'' Uh, he thought maybe you should consider calling ... Mom.

'''Nya''': Mom? Why?

'''Kai''': She was the elemental master of water before you. You know, she can help, offer advice, or something?

'''Nya''': I don't ''need'' help. I can figure it out! I just need to relax a bit. Find my focus again. Regroup!

'''Kai''': I'm just saying, she might know something. She might be able to fix your little problem.

'''Nya''': I don't have a problem. I made one mistake, okay? A teensy tiny mistake and it won't happen again! ''(She punches the training post so hard she breaks it.)''

'''Kai''': I'm gonna go ... do something else. ''(He walks away nervously.)''

'''Nya''': ''(She completely destroys the wooden post.)'' Who's losing control now? Not me! ''(heads back inside.)''

----

''(She passes by the bathroom as the toilet flushes before bursting.)''

'''Jay''': ''(from inside the bathroom.)'' Oh no! The toilet's exploding! Someone help! ''(Nya quickly runs away.)'' Why?!

''(In the kitchen, Zane is doing the dishes when the tap goes out of control, spraying water out. Nya quickly runs away. She hides in the gaming room, only to see three bottles of soda to burst and go out of the control, startling Cole, who falls off the couch.)''

'''Nya''': Oh! ''(She runs away again.)

----

''(The ninja and Wu find her in the courtyard.)''

'''Wu''': Nya, we need to talk. ''(Suddenly, there is a knock on the gates.)''

'''Nya''': ''(Sighs.)'' I'll get it. ''(She opens the doors dejectedly and is shocked to see her parents.)''

'''Maya''': Nya dear, oh, you poor thing! Look at you! Kai told me all about what's happening and I don't want you to worry anymore. Whatever it is, we're gonna figure it out, you and me, mother and daughter, working together. I'll be with you every single moment of every day, until we figure this out. ''(She hugs Nya tightly.)'' Bring the bags, [[Ray]]! Oh, Kai, which way is Nya's room?

'''Kai''': Oh, uh, that way. ''(He looks up to see Ray buried under a pile of luggage.)''

'''Ray''': Hi, son. Good to see you. ''(He extends a hand to Kai.)''

'''Kai''': ''(He takes Ray's hand and shakes it.)'' Hi... Dad. Do you, need a hand?

'''Ray''': Oh, no, I've got it! I'm... good. ''(He nearly loses his balance, but is able to stumble after Maya.)''

'''Nya''': Kai! ''(She glares at Kai menacingly, her eye twitching. Everyone else looks up with a scared expression, especially Jay, who is hiding behind Wu.)''

'''Kai''': What?
