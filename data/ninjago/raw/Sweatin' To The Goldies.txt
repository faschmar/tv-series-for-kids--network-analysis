'''[[Gayle Gossip]]:''' This is Gayle Gossip, coming live from the star-studded premier of ''[[Clutch Powers: A Musical Life]].'' It's the four-and-a-half hour musical biopic extravaganza that critics have universally hailed as certainly a lot. The screening—

'''[[Clutch Powers]]:''' (''Grabs the mic from Gayle.)'' Well, of course I'll give you a sound byte. I'm so flattered you asked!

'''Gayle Gossip:''' Hey!

'''Clutch Powers:''' As star, writer, and director...

''([[Zane]] and [[Jay]] walk along the red carpet, stopping to strike poses multiple times, as Clutch continues talking in the background.)''

'''Jay:''' This new [[Types of gi#Golden Legacy robes .282021.29|gi]] is chafing me.

'''Clutch Powers:''' ...thing that ever happened! My hope is that everyone in [[Ninjago City]] will come out to see my movie. Actually, that's my wish! ''(Suddenly, orange smoke billows from the [[Teapot of Tyrahn|teapot]] in his hand, and he looks down, surprised.)''

'''Zane:''' Jay, I found this movie confusing. Why would Dr. Powers suddenly burst into song and dance? Illogical.

'''Jay:''' Ugh, they're called musical numbers, and they're super terrible! That big one in the middle where Clutch kept spelling out his own name in song? Ugh, horrible! I can't get it out of my head!

'''Zane:''' He kept singing to his own biceps! Why? As a [[Nindroids|Nindroid]], such behavior makes no sense to me. 

'''Jay:''' That's not just a Nindroid problem, they make no sense to anyone! I mean in real life, you can't just sing and dance your way out of a death trap!

'''Zane:''' Can we return to [[Monastery of Spinjitzu|the Monastery]] now? 

'''Jay:''' Are you kidding? The best part of any movie premiere is the afterparty! Come on, I have seriously earned some free appetizers.

'''Zane''':  ''(Just then, his communicator starts beeping.)'' Break in at the [[Ninjago Museum of History|museum]].

'''Jay''': Ugh, so much for appetizers. Hey, Zane! One more for the fans! ''(They strike more poses for the cameras.)''

''(At the museum, [[Reflectra]] removes a painting from its frame.)''

'''Reflectra''': Mm, yes. Shopping for art is so much more fun when you don't have to pay. ''(Suddenly, Jay bursts in, startling her.)''

'''Jay''': Give up, villain! Just seriously, please, give up? There's this party we're trying to make it to, there's probably a guest limit ... I mean, it might be a whole wristband situation — hey, who are you anyway?

'''Reflectra''': Call me ... Reflectra! And I've got a party for you. ''(She leaps down from a balcony while spinning, forming a diamond shape, and attacks the pair.)'' A party of pain!

'''Zane''': We decline your invitation to this party, as it sounds unappealing. ''(He blasts some ice at her.)''

'''Reflectra''': Reflectra! ''(She spins and redirects the blast back at Zane. Jay then tries to use his [[Lightning]] against her.)'' Reflectra! ''(She spins again and reflects the blast.)'' You starting to get the name? Anything you send at me, I'll ''Reflectra'' right back at you!

'''Jay''': So you spin. Cute! Then you'll probably like this!

'''Zane and Jay''': [[Spinjitzu]]! ''(They do Spinjitzu.)''

'''Reflectra''': Reflectra! ''(She neutralizes the two.)'' I've studied your every move. I know everything you're gonna' do before you do it. There's no way you'll stop me.

'''Zane''': Then perhaps we should do something unpredictable. Something that makes no sense to anyone.

'''Jay''': Makes no sense? I don't get — oh. You can't mean ...

'''Zane''': Initializing vocalist. ''(He presses a button on his arm.)'' La-la-la-lo. Whoa.

'''Jay''': Oh, this better work. ''(He disables all the lights with his powers.)''

'''Reflectra''': Huh? What is this nonsense?

'''Jay''': ''(Singing.)'' ''C, L, U, T, C, H!''

'''Zane''': ''(Also singing.)'' ''P, O, W, E, R, S!''

'''Reflectra''': What? No one breaks out into a musical number in real life!

'''Zane and Jay''': ''Clutch Powers, he knows he's the best!''

'''Jay''': ''He's a rugged superstar —''

'''Zane''': — ''a man of mystery!''

'''Jay''': ''He unveils the secret past —''

'''Zane''': — ''of all of history!''

'''Reflectra''': Hey, hey! Stop that! I've studied you. You never do this! This makes no sense! ''(She screams as they fling her into the air.)''

'''Jay''': ''His archaeological theories —''

'''Zane''': ''— are almost always sound!''

'''Jay''': ''His torso, legs, bones, and knees —''

'''Zane''': ''— are just so muscle bound!''

'''Reflectra''': Stop it! The ninja moves I can deal with, but the singing is torture!

'''Jay''': ''He can escape any booby trap!''

'''Zane''': ''But he can't think of a rhyme for booby trap!''

'''Zane and Jay''': ''Clutch Powers, he knows he's the world's greatest adventurer!''

'''Clutch hologram''': I work alone.

''(Later, Zane and Jay carry an unconscious Reflectra outside.)''

'''Zane''': Hmm, I guess you ''can'' dance your way out of a death trap.

'''Jay''': Clutch must never know about this! Now come on. If we hurry, maybe I can still grab some appetizers!

'''Reflectra''': Reflectra ...
