''([[Zane]] awakens in a hazy state to find the other ninja fighting the [[Re-Awakened]].)''

'''Zane''': The Re-Awakened? But that means we're in the-

'''[[Jay]]''': The [[Mines of Shintaro|mines]] beneath [[Kingdom of Shintaro|Shintaro]]! Or at least it looks like it. ''(He kicks a Warrior away.)'' This is weird!

'''[[Cole]]''': How are these skeletons here? We dealt with all of them before!

'''Jay''': Guess nobody told them that! Has anyone seen my dragon? I swear I just had a dragon!

'''Cole''': Check it out! Master [[Wu]]!

''(Wu screams as the [[Legendary Dragon]] carries him through a portal.)''

'''Zane''': We just missed them again!

'''Cole''': ''(He tries to use his [[Earth Punch]], but it doesn't work.)'' Something's not right. I can't connect to the earth! There's too much [[Vengestone]] down here. We've got to get to that portal, but without powers, there's just no way to clear our -

''(Suddenly, giant boulders land in front of him, smashing the Warriors.)''

'''Cole''': Okay, so maybe there is. Look! It's Chancellor [[Gulch]] and some of the other [[Geckles]]!

''(They watch as the Geckles lift a giant boulder onto a catapult.)''

'''Zane''': How come they are so strong? This ''is'' weird. ''(He analyzes the Warriors.)'' Two more such hits and we should be able to proceed to the portal!

''(Gulch pulls the lever, but it breaks.)''

'''Cole''': And there goes our only hope!

'''Zane''': Continue the battle. I will see if I can assist the Geckles. ''(He Spinjitzus over to them.)''

'''Gulch''': Ah, non-skeleton ninja Zane! Oh, we are pleased you are here. Let us show our appreciation! ''(He and the Geckles shower him with pebbles.)''

'''Zane''': Please, stop! Your painful welcome is potentially injurious! ''(He analyzes the lever.)'' This is suboptimal. A replacement lever is required.

'''Gulch''': But we don't have an extra lever. We used all our levers at the recent [[Lever Bonfire Festival]]!

'''Zane''': Lever Bonfire Festival?

'''Gulch''': Yes, a yearly Geckle tradition. We symbolically burn all spare levers to stop evil from having leverage over our hearts.

'''Zane''': Without a suitable replacement with an adequate connection grip, this damage is not repairable.

'''Gulch''': Is there nothing you can do? We use this catapult to defend our [[Geckle Strong-Cave|Strong-Cave]]. Without it, our people will be overrun!

'''Zane''': I will reevaluate. ''(He studies the broken lever and his left arm, then detaches his arm and attaches it to the catapult.)'' Your device is now functional.

''(The Geckles cheer.)''

'''Gulch''': You gave your own arm to protect us? We will not forget this. Fire! ''(He launches a boulder, which destroys more Warriors.)''

'''Cole''': That's the stuff! Just one more!

'''Gulch''': Fire!

'''Cole''': We're clear! Let's go!

'''Zane''': Wait. Ninja, look!

''(They turn to see the Geckles being surrounded.)''

'''Zane''': The Geckles helped us. We cannot abandon them.

'''Cole''': But, the portal! Master Wu!

'''Zane''': Master Wu would not want us to abandon the Geckles to their fate.

'''Cole''': You're right.

''(They defeat the Warriors, and the Geckles cheer.)''

'''Jay''': The portal's almost gone! We'll never make it!

'''Gulch''': Yes, you will. Get on! ''(The ninja get into the catapult.)'' Fire!

'''Zane''': Thank youuuuu!

''(The ninja fly through the portal as the Geckles cheer.)''
