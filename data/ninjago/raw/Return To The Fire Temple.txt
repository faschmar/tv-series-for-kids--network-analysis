}}''(The episode begins with [[Kai]] and [[Nya]] riding on the [[Flame|Fire Dragon]], now named Flame, when the [[Dragons|Dragon]] soon takes a detour to the [[Fire Temple]].)''

'''Kai''': What's going on... ''(He and Nya start screaming.)''

''(They arrive at the Fire Temple.)''

'''Nya''': The Fire Temple? Boy, are you feeling homesick, Flame?

'''Kai''': Maybe he forgot his toothbrush.

''(Flame roars and opens up the entrance to the Fire Temple.)''

'''Nya''': Awesome!

'''Kai''': Flame, why did you bring us back here?

'''Nya''': I think he wants to show you something.

'''Kai''': ''(Being nudged by Flame.)'' Okay, okay. I'm going.

''(The trio move along to see the [[Skulkin]] at the secret entrance to the [[Underworld]].)''

'''Kai''': Ahh... so that's what you wanted to show us... a secret entrance to the Underworld. (''Kai accidentally slips and lands where the Skulkin are and prepares to take action.)''

'''[[Krazi]]''': ''(After spotting Kai.)'' Uh...[[Wyplash]], boss. We got company.

'''Wyplash''': Huh? [[Ninja]]?! Attack!

''(A bunch of Skulkin Warriors charge towards Kai as he attacks and disarms them. They all grab Kai's feet.)''

'''Kai''': ''(Attempting [[Spinjitzu]].)'' Ninja, Go! ''(This has no effect as they still tightly hold his feet.)''

'''Wyplash''': Not so strong without [[Zane|the]] [[Cole|three]] [[Jay|amigos]] backing you up, are you?!

'''Nya''': Hold on, Kai! We're coming to help! ''(She and Flame fly towards Kai.)''

'''Kai''': I can handle it.

'''Nya''': No you can't, stupid.

'''Kai''': I'm formulating a plan here.

''(Flame breathes out [[fire]] to make the Skulkin retreat back to the Underworld and seals them in with a couple of boulders blocking the entrance.)''

'''Nya''': Yep! I don't think their boney butts will be bothering us for a while.

'''Kai''': See? I told you I'd think of something.

'''Nya''': Huh.

''(The three leave as [[Kruncha]] and [[Nuckal]] head to the barricaded entrance still n flames.)''

'''Kruncha''': You dummy! ''(Slaps Nuckal.)'' You left the stove on again, didn't you?!

'''Nuckal''': No, you did!

''(The episode ends with the two fighting each other.)''
