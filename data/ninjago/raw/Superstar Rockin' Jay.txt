Disclaimer: Please note that the names of two members of the Jays are not yet confirmed, unless they can be confirmed with a source. They are only used as placeholders to separate the Jays.

''([[Cole]], [[Kai]], [[Lloyd]], and [[Nya]] are taking in the scenery of [[Terra Technica]].)''

'''Cole''': Whoa. This place is amazing. ''(Avatars are seen buying food and weapons.)'' Where should we start? Maybe find a way to customize our avatars? We can upgrade our look!

'''Nya''': Cole, I know this ''[[Prime Empire]]'' place is like video game paradise for you, but our mission is to find [[Jay]], not to get designer clothes.

'''Lloyd''': Uh, guys, that mission just got a bit more complicated! ''(People are interrupted by the [[Red Visors]] marching in to confront the [[ninja]]. The people scatter, all shops close, no one is left except for the Red Visors and the ninja.)''

'''Cole''': Maybe this isn't as bad as it looks. Some games have tutorial assistants who meet new players and teach them how the game works.

'''Red Visor''': ''(They raise their weapons.)'' Eliminate the enemies of [[Unagami]]!

'''Kai''': ''(Winces.)'' It's as bad as it looks. ''(The Red Visors fire their weapons and the ninja dodge them.)''

'''Lloyd''': Time to go [[Spinjitzu]] on these digital creeps. Ninja, go! ''(They leap into the air and... Nya falls flat face on the ground, Lloyd lands on his feet, crouched, Cole flips on to the ground, and Kai does a slow spin.)''

'''Kai''': Whoa, whoa! ''(He continues spinning and crashes into something off scene. The Red Visors stop and look at each other, confused.)''

'''Nya''': Uh... Does anyone know what just happened? ''(Lloyd and Cole shrug.)'' Or didn't happen?

'''Kai''': ''(Still tries to do Spinjitzu, spinning around.)'' Ugh. Come on, Spinjitzu! Come on! ''(Cole catches him. The Red Visors go back to shooting.)''

'''Lloyd''': New plan. [[Elemental Powers|Elemental powers]]! Go! ''(They strain to release their powers, but nothing happens. Kai sighs, exhausted.)''

'''Nya''': Seriously? ''(They jump away and run off to hide as the Red Visors continue shooting at them.)''

'''Kai''': Whoa!

'''Lloyd''': Ahh!

'''Nya''': What's going on?

'''Kai''': Not again! Awh! Can't I go, like, two seconds without losing my elemental powers?!

'''Lloyd''': Fight now and figure it out later. ''(They jump out from hiding.)''

'''Kai''': ''(He punches straight into a Red Visor's chest.)'' Hunh-unh. ''(He immediately grabs his hand, wincing at the pain.)'' Ahh.

'''Cole''': ''(He leaps at another Red Visor, but the Visor turns away and watches him fly by into a pile of hats.)'' Wha-ahh!

'''Lloyd''': ''(He continues punching and kicking the Visor he is facing, but it has zero effect on them. Panting.) ''I don't get it. I feel weak and slow! ''(The Visor grabs his hand.)'' Huh? ''(The Visor punches him across the path before Lloyd finishes his kick.)'' Unh.

'''Nya''': ''(She back flips.) ''Ha-unh! It's like our hard-earned ninja skills have been deleted or—Whoa! ''(The Visor facing her punches her to the ground and aims their gun at her. Nya holds her hand over her face and looks away. Suddenly Jay leaps in, landing a blow on the Visor. The laser from the gun misses Nya. She throws off her hood.)'' Jay?

'''Cole''': Hey, Nya, finding Jay isn't gonna be as hard as we thought. Look! ''(They see Jay sweeping a Red Visor's feet up and punching them across the chest.)''

'''Nya''': How did he get over there?

'''Kai''': Guys! Jay's here! ''(They see Jay punching a Visor, back flipping and kicking the Visor, and giving a side kick to finish it off.)''

'''Cole''': ''(Cole and Kai throw off their hoods.)'' Whoa. Does he have teleportation powers in this game or—

'''Lloyd''': Gah! ''(They see Lloyd fall to the ground and Jay leaping in with a flying kick and jumping at the last Visor.)''

'''[[Jaybird 64]]''': Ha! Unh! ''(Cole, Kai, and Nya run up to Lloyd and watch the last Visor poof. They look up to see four Jays approach them.)''

'''[[Beta Jay 137]]''': Friends of Jay... welcome! ''(He extends his hand out to Lloyd, pulling him to his feet.)''

'''Lloyd''': ''(He throws off his hood and scratches his head.)'' Which of you is the real Jay?

'''Beta Jay 137''': The "real" Jay is in the hearts of all who live by his word.

'''Jaybird 64''': ''(Simultaneously.)'' Jay's will be done.

'''[[Jaywalkin 238]]''': ''(Simultaneously.)'' In Jay we trust.

'''[[Dee-Jay 81]]''': ''(Simultaneously.)'' In Jay we trust.

'''Beta Jay 137''': We are from "The [[League of Jay]]."

'''Cole''': Oh! You're all players, and you've chosen to play as avatars of Jay.

'''Kai''': Uh, we're talking about Jay? Right? Like, our Jay? ''(They see three of Unagami's [[aerial drones]] scanning the grounds below.)''

'''Beta Jay 137''': Hurry! Come with us if you want to keep playing. ''(They watch the four Jays jump over the building.)''

'''Lloyd''': I guess we don't have a choice. ''(They watch him run up to the building and jump.) ''Ha-unh! ''(He face plants into the building halfway up before sliding back down to the ground.) ''Ah. Uh, how did—What did just—huh?

'''Cole''': Hmm...Maybe you have to double-jump. Like in other video games, to reach really tall places. Watch. Jump! Double-jump! ''(He double jumps up the building successfully.)''

'''Kai''': That makes no sense! ''(They see the Red Drones approaching closer.)''

'''Nya''': ''(Gasps and takes Kai's hand.)'' Go with it! ''(The Drones see them and shoot at them as they double jump the building.)'' Wow! I just jumped on air.

'''Beta Jay 137''': Hurry! The great Jay wills it so! ''(They run and jump over buildings.)''

'''Lloyd''': I don't get it. ''(He ducks his head, panting.)'' I run all the time, but I'm already... getting... tired.

'''Beta Jay 137''': Of course, you're getting tired. You're a noob. Your stamina stats are probably quite low.

'''Cole''': Wait. Are you saying the reason we don't have our powers is because—

'''Beta Jay 137''': You haven't bought any skills yet. Here. See my skill tree. See? I have Level 48 stamina. ''(He switches the screen.)'' And I have enough experience points to buy another skill. Here. ''(He purchases the skill.) ''"Super-back-flip-flying-kick." ''(He back flips, taking out two drones.)''

'''Nya''': Seriously? It took me months to learn that move in the real world. But in here you just "buy another skill?" Not fair! ''(They come to a stop as four Red Drones appear in front of them and three more behind them.)''

'''Beta Jay 137''': There may come a day when the courage of Jays fails... but this is not that day!

'''Jays''': Jay-Ja... go! ''(The four Jays take out many Drones with their [[Katana]]s and skills. The ninja decide to hop into the fight. Cole sloppily punches a Drone. Nya repeatedly misses delivering hits on her Drone. Kai jumps onto a Drone and tries to punch out laser source. The Drone fires and Kai is thrown down the building.)''

'''Kai''': Wha-ahh! ''(He disappears below.)''

'''Lloyd''': Kai! ''(He punches the building and mourns the loss of his friend. Kai immediately reappears beside him. In the background, Cole runs off with a Drone shooting at him. Nya rides a Drone, trying to destroy it. Jaywalkin 238 strikes a Drone and a [[Chickens|chicken]] pops out. Cole is seen popping out his head and he disappears again when he sees a Drone aiming at him.)''

'''Kai''': ''(Looks around.)'' I-I'm alive? ''(He pats himself.) ''How am I alive? ''(Lloyd rubs his eyes.)'' I just-I—Oh, duh! ''(Lloyd scratches his head.)'' Video game! I just re-spawned. Ha! None of this is real!

'''Lloyd''': It feels real! ''(He runs off with a Drone chasing him.)''

'''Beta Jay 137''': ''(Nya is backing up from a Drone when he jumps in and destroys it.)'' We will draw them away. Follow the streets to the northwest for 13 blocks. There you will find [[Scott|one of our allies]] waiting. ''(He strikes out a Drone.)'' Give him the password, "[[Mister Cuddlywomp]]" and he will bring you to Superstar Rockin' Jay. Now fly!

'''Nya''': I understand... kind of.

'''Beta Jay 137''': Hmm, I can see why you are beloved to him. ''(Nya stares at him as the Jays run off, leading the Drones away. The rest of the ninja jump down into alley.)''

'''Nya''': The Jays said we need to go to— ''(They immediately pause when they see three Red Visors ahead. Nya gasps.) ''Hide! ''(They leap behind a few boxes, except for Kai, who boldly stands unhidden.)'' Kai! Hide!

'''Kai''': Why? This is a game. If they blast us, we just come back. Here, I'll distract, you get around behind them. ''(They watch him, uneasily, as he approaches the Visors.)'' Hey, guys! You know who's ''totally'' lame? ''(The Red Visors cringe at the sound of the name.) ''Unagami, that's who!

'''Red Visor''': The enemies of Unagami ''must'' pay! ''(They raise their weapons and fire at him, chasing him down the alley. Kai stops.)''

'''Kai''': Whoo— ''(He dies happily and Cole, Lloyd, and Nya get around behind the Visors, placing tires on them and rolling them away. Kai respawns beside them.)'' See? "Re-spawn" is my new favorite word. Whoo-hoo!

'''Cole''': Uh, I don't know if that's really smart. In games-

'''Kai''': ''(Shrugs him off.)'' Whatever, Cole. You're just annoyed that as the team's gaming guru, you weren't the one who figured this out! ''(He marches away, proud of himself, while Cole watches him suspicious of his actions.)'' Huh!

'''Lloyd''': Come on, guys.

'''Nya''': This is where they told us to meet. Only... there's no garage.

'''Lloyd''': Why send us to an empty lot?

'''Kai''': I told you. They're wackos! Anyone who likes Jay that much can't be normal.

'''Man''': Freeze. ''(They see a man holding a laser gun at them.)'' Talk. Before Mister Ginormous here does the talking.

'''Cole''': Um, shoot, what was it? Mister Snugglewomp? Fuddlewimp? No, no Fud-Fud—Argh! Buddygump?

'''Nya''': "Mister Cuddlywomp."

'''Man''': ''(Sighs.)'' The League sent you, huh? Let me guess. You're here to see Superstar Rockin' Jay? ''(They nod.)'' Come on. Before someone sees us. ''(They exchange confused looks and watch as the man enters in a hidden garage.)''

'''Nya''': A cloaked hideout? ''(The doors shut behind them.)''

'''Cole, Kai, and Lloyd''': Wow.

'''Nya''': Awesome!

'''Man''': Name's Scott. I'm a mechanic. My garage is hidden by a Level 999 Stealth Barrier. Those Red Visors can't see it. ''(scoffs)'' Even Unagami can't.

'''Nya''': What are you hiding from?

'''Scott''': The Red Visors want me to compete in the [[Speedway Five-Billion]]. Like everyone else. But I'm smarter. No thanks. And the League of Jays keep my secret, so I help them rebuild their vehicles and weapons and stuff.

'''Kai''': Hm. What's this?

'''Scott''': Don't touch that, it's— ''(They watch tools fly as Kai presses the button and he poofs.)'' Dangerous...

'''Kai''': ''(He reappears next to Scott and grabs him.)'' Huh. I love this infinite-lives-thing!

'''Scott''': ''(He pushes his arm back.) ''Infinite? Who told you that? ''(He presses Kai's heart and his [[Health boards|health board]] appears over him.)'' You get four lives in ''Prime Empire''. And looks like you've used three.

'''Kai''': ''(gasps)'' What? What? Why didn't anyone tell me this?

'''Cole''': I ''tried'', but you wouldn't listen.

'''Kai''': Oh, sure, blame the victim! ''(Cole, Lloyd, and Nya look at each other and bring up their health boards.)'' So, so wait, what happens if I lose this last one?

'''Scott''': You don't want to know. It's horrible. Why do you think I won't race in the Speedway? ''(He brings up his health board.)'' I only have one life left myself. ''(He pushes aside a few boxes and presses a button.)'' Anyway. If you seek Superstar Rockin' Jay, this is the way. ''(They follow him through a tunnel.)''

'''Cole''': We're supposed to trust a complete stranger and go into a dangerous looking dark hole? ''(They make their way through and gaze out at the sight of so many players dressed up as Jay.)''

'''Kai''': I... I can't believe this. Are we in a nightmare?

'''Beta Jay 137''': Attention League of Jay. ''(No one pays attention and he turns up his volume. It echoes across the room.)'' Attention League of Jay! It is time for the arrival of our hero, our inspiration, the reason for our very existence... Superstar Rockin' Jay himself! ''(The ninja gaze in astonishment at the sight of Jay rising to the stage from below, strumming a [[Jay's guitar|guitar]]. Jay hands over his guitar to Beta Jay 137.)''

'''Jay''': Aww. ''(He chuckles, waving.)'' Hmm. ''(He gasps at the sight of his friends.)'' Guys? Is that really you? ''(He hugs them.)'' Wow, I've been waiting for you. Is this place awesome, or what?!
