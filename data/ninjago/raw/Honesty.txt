''([[Kai]] and [[Jay]] emerge from a portal, both riding their dragons.)''

'''Kai''': Aww, man! I did not miss this place.

'''Jay''': Seriously! This place is the worst! Okay, I have no idea where we are.

'''Kai''': In the [[Never-Realm]]. The [[Castle of Ice|Ice Emperor's palace]].

'''Ice Emperor''': You have been summoned for competition!

'''Kai''': [[Zane]], why are you pretending to be the Ice Emperor again?

'''Jay''': Yeah! Quit being a weirdo and knock this off!

'''Zane''': You are in error! ''(He and the other ninja are revealed to be in a [[Vengestone]] cage.)'' That is not me!

'''Jay''': What? How? You're the Ice Emperor!

'''Zane''': Clearly not right now.

'''Jay''': Point taken.

'''Ice Emperor''': Ninja are said to have many virtues. You will engage in a joust to determine just what those are.

'''Kai''': Uh, can't we just juggle or something? Jay's a pretty good ventriloquist.

'''Jay''': No I'm not!

'''Kai''': Shh! I'm trying to lie our way out of this!

'''Jay''': The lie about my ventriloquism skills is easily disprovable! And you shouldn't lie anyway.

'''Kai''': Since when did you become Mr. Truth Fanatic?

'''Ice Emperor''': You will each joust one of my [[Blizzard Samurai|Ice Samurai]] without the use of dragon flight. If you defeat both of them - ''(He creates a portal.)'' - I will free your friends and allow you to go through this portal to find your Master [[Wu]]. But if you lose - ''(He blasts the cage.)'' - I will turn you into frozen statues for all eternity.

'''Kai''': So that's a no on the juggling.

'''Ice Emperor''': Enough! Prepare for battle!

''(Kai and an Ice Samurai get into jousting position.)''

'''Ice Emperor''': Begin!

''(Kai defeats his opponent and the ninja cheer.)''

'''Ice Emperor''': The victor is Kai.

'''Kai''': Yeah!

'''Ice Emperor''': If you ninja win the next joust, you gain your freedom and the portal.

'''Kai''': No pressure.

''(Jay nods and gets ready to joust.)''

'''Ice Emperor''': Begin!

'''Kai''': Come on, Jay, you've got this!

''(Jay knocks his opponent off, but he falls off as well. His dragon nudges him back onto its back.)''

'''Kai''': Oh right!

'''Jay''': I was knocked off too! They couldn't see it!

'''Kai''': Shh! Don't bring that up! For all anyone knows, we won. Fairly!

'''Ice Emperor''': You have bested my warriors in an honest joust. They will pay the price for their defeat.

'''Jay''': Stop!

'''Kai''': ''(whispering)'' What are you doing?!

'''Jay''': No innocent should suffer because of lies! I was also knocked from my steed. I did not win.

'''Kai''': Great time to develop principles, Jay!

'''Ice Emperor''': ''(claps)'' No. You are indeed the victor. I was aware you were knocked off. But this was not a test of jousting skill. It was a test of honesty.

''(He blasts the chains and frees the other ninja.)''

'''Zane''': Nice work, Jay!

'''Ice Emperor''': Your Master Wu needs your help. Go now. Go to his aid.

'''Zane''': Come on, everyone. Let's go!

'''Kai''': Still think the ventriloquism would have worked.

'''Jay''': Ventriloquism. Yeah, I guess. Goes without saying!

''(The ninja enter the portal and it disappears behind them.)''
