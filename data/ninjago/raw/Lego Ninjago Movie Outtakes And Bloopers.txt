[[Nya (The LEGO Ninjago Movie)|'''Nya''']]: Who wants a ride to class?

'''[[Lloyd (The LEGO Ninjago Movie)|Lloyd]]''': Aw, that's-that's alright Nya, my lock- (''Nya hoists Lloyd, Kai, and Zane onto her bike.'')

'''Nya''': Heads up! Watch out! (''She takes off, not noticing Kai and Zane have fallen off.'')

'''Lloyd''': Stop it!

'''Nya''': What do you do!?

'''Lloyd''': Stop!

'''Nya''': What do you do? Lloyd, what's the secret?

'''Lloyd''': (laughs.) I just-wake up, and my [[Koko|mom]] cuts it, and-

'''Nya''': Aw, that's cool.

'''Lloyd''': Yeah. 

'''Nya''': That's cool.

'''Lloyd''': Not a big deal. Whatever.

'''Nya''': See? You totally forgot about everything.

'''Director''': Okay, here we go! Shooting! Thank you! Quiet, please!

'''Zane''': H2â€“Woah! (''He freezes a fish tank.'')

'''[[Jay (The LEGO Ninjago Movie)|Jay]]''': Oh no. Um, can you undo it? They-they're still wiggling, but-

'''Zane''': Let me try. (uses his [[Ultimate Ultimate Weapon|ice piece]].) Oh no. I just froze it even more.

'''Jay''': You double froze em.

'''Zane''': Correct. ([[Cole (The LEGO Ninjago Movie)|Cole]] laughs.)

'''Jay''': Um. Hey Kai, you can do [[fire]], right!?

'''Kai''': (holds up his fire piece.) Yeah. 

'''Jay''': Maybe you could-

'''Zane''': Kai, melt the fish.

'''Kai''': Sure, sure, sure. No problem! Here we go! (He melts all the [[ice]].) Oh. It's-

'''Zane''': You made fish fingers. (everyone laughs.) Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, okay.

'''[[Wu (The LEGO Ninjago Movie)|Wu]]''': (posing with his [[Bo staff|staff]].) You must be silent. But deadly.

(There is silence, until all of the [[Secret Ninja Force|ninja]] except Zane laugh.)

'''Jay''': That's a fart thing.

'''Wu''': Unbelievable. 
----

'''Nya''': You-you part your hair in a new way today?

'''Jay''': I-

'''Nya''': I, uh, I, uh, I just noticed.

'''Jay''': I-

'''Nya''': Thought I would just say something.

'''Jay''': Yeah. I was just-you know, I've been sort of fighting the natural way my hair goes for a while, and now I'm like (whispers) I'm just going to go for it.

'''Nya''': I think it looks great.

'''Zane''': (suddenly appears with a brush and scissors, changing Jay's hair style) You look like Doris Day.

'''Jay''': Thanks.

'''Lloyd''': Enjoy your last day-(phone rings.) Oh! No! Let me not-copy that-Oh. Sorry about that. Cell phone is ''definitely'' off now.
----

'''Lloyd''': Enjoy your last day-(phone rings again.) (laughs hastily.) Not-not me. Uh-uh. (''He sees Garmadon calling him.'') Dad! (worker hands him a coffee.) Thanks.

'''Garmadon''': Look, I didn't call you, my butt called you. So you gotta problem with it, take it up with my butt. (crew laughs.)

'''Lloyd''': I'm fine with that.
----

'''Zane''': Hey! I can make you an [[ice cream]]. Provided that you want a plain, water-flavored ice cream. 

'''Jay''': That's just ice.

'''Zane''': I'll make you a plain popsicle! 

'''Jay''': That's just ice.

'''Zane''': I'll make you one thousand plain popsicles. 

'''Jay''': I don't wanna.

'''Zane''': How would you like to cry solid material?

'''Jay''': That's okay, thank you. I don't want to. I feel-  don't misuse the power he just got.

'''Zane''': Okay.

'''Jay''': Just keep it in check. 

'''Zane''': I could work as a Zamboni. 

'''Jay''': Zamboni's don't actually make the ice, they just make it even. They don't make the ice.

'''Zane''': Nancy Kerrigan will fall in love with me.

'''Wu''': Like a trusty boomerang. (throws his conical hat into the air.) Whoo! I have- ( It hits him.) Argh!
