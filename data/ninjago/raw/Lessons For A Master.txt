''(In [[Ninjago]], [[Garmadon]] uses the [[Colossus]] to destroy buildings on its way to [[the Resistance]]'s location.)''

'''[[Dareth]]''': Guys, we need to go! Pronto!

'''[[Lloyd]]''': [[Skylor]], you have to wake up!

'''[[Nya]]''': We have to run.

'''Dareth''': Run? One of us can't even stand!

'''Lloyd''': Let's move!

''(A car is thrown at the doorway, blocking their way into the building. Lloyd, Nya, and Dareth look back to see the Colossus hammer a blow on the building and immediately run to jump at the building next to theirs.)''

'''Nya''': Jump, Dareth! ''(Another car is thrown at them.)''

''(Dareth screams and jumps to building. He slips, grabbing hold of the edge in the last second. Nya jumps, landing with a small twirl on the next building. She grabs Dareth before he falls over.)''

'''Nya''': Throw her over!

'''Lloyd''': That's not going to work.

'''Nya''': ''(Gasps.)'' Lloyd! ''(Lloyd jumps into the air as the Colossus punches the building.)'' No! ''(Lloyd lands on the Colossus's fist. Garmadon sees Lloyd and tries to throw him off. Lloyd runs across the fist, landing on the building with Nya and Dareth.)''

'''Dareth''': Lloyd! Yes! ''(The Colossus roars and everyone runs away.)''

'''Garmadon''': You think you can hide from my wrath! I'll destroy every building to find you! ''(Nya, Dareth, Lloyd run through an aisle to stop at another street. Lloyd puts Skylor down.)''

'''[[Gayle Gossip|Gayle]]''': ''(On TV.)'' Everyone should leave the [[Ninjago City|city]] at once! Nowhere is safe!

'''Dareth''': Ever since Garmadon lost Harumi, he's lost his marbles!

'''Nya''': Dareth's right. He's not going to stop until he finds us.

'''Lloyd''': I know.

'''Nya''': There's only one thing that can withstand that. I ditched the [[Battle Wagon]] across town. If we can get to it... we can leave the city.

'''Lloyd''': Leave the city?!

'''Nya''': Just until things calm down.

'''Dareth''': Lloyd, I'm with Nya. [[Mystake]] said we needed to survive until the [[Stranded ninja|ninja]] got back. Well, where are they, huh? There's no shame in knowing when to turn tail.

'''Lloyd''': Okay, we go for the Battle Wagon. But we're not skipping town. We hold on for as long as we can. ''(Nya and Dareth run off. Lloyd looks up.)'' Where are you guys? ''(Lloyd runs.)''

----

''(In the [[Realm of Oni and Dragons|First Realm]], [[Jay]], [[Kai]], [[Cole]], [[Zane]], and [[Faith]] are currently tied up.)''

'''Kai''': ''(He sighs, then sees a shadow of a bird.'') I hope that's your [[Falcon]], Zane.

'''Zane''': My receptors pick up that, that is a avian scavenger, a harbinger of our approaching demise.

'''Faith''': It's a [[Bonepickers|Bonepicker]], and Zane is right.

'''Jay''': Why does Zane always have to be right? Can't it just be enough that we're tied to giant poles in the middle of the desert?! And don't forget [[Wu]] is being held hostage, forced to steal for [[Iron Baron]] the [[Dragon Armor]], so that he can become invincible! Can't that be enough?!

'''Cole''': (''Scavenger lands by Cole.'') No! Don't come to me! ''(He kicks his foot.'') Shoo. ''(Bird flies away.)''

'''Kai''': ''(Raises his head.)'' Look. Something's going on.

'''[[Jet Jack]]''': ''(Snatches from conversation.)'' Not again... come outside!... Stop questioning me. ''([[Muzzle]] retorts back.)'' Oh, come on! ''(Arguing continues.)''

'''Jay''': Probably arguing about which one of us to eat first.

'''Faith''': [[Dragon Hunters]] do not eat people.

'''Jay''': Well, that's good to know, Faith. So, it isn't all bad.

'''Kai''': This is our chance, while they're distracted. Let's see if we can get these... ''(Grunts.)'' poles rocking ''(Grunts.)'' by rocking our bodies ''(Grunts.)'' from side to side. (''Grunts.'')

'''Cole''': Yeah, I'm not doing that.

'''Zane''': That... won't be helpful.

'''Kai''': Guys, come on. Teamwork. ''(Grunts.)'' If we all do it together... ''(He swings legs. Cole and Zane sigh and join in.)''

'''Faith''': ''(Sighs.)'' I hope the Son of the [[First Spinjitzu Master|Spinjitzu Master]] figures something out, because this is ridiculous.

'''Jay''': Hey, it's better than nothing. ''(He starts swinging. Faith sighs.)''

''(Wu and Iron Baron are following the map to [[Firstbourne's nest]].)''

'''Wu''': Tell me something. Why did you lie to your Hunters? About the [[Oni]] being real?

'''Iron Baron''': I told them what they wanted to hear, that I will keep them safe. And in return, all I ask is to be treated like a king. Is that so wrong? Look around. This is a cruel world. We do what we must to survive.

'''Wu''': There's more to life than surviving. ''(Iron Baron laughs.)'' You already control this realm. Why do you need my Father's armor?

'''Iron Baron''': There's always more to rule. That's the beauty of power. One can never have enough. Are you sure the Dragon Armor will control [[Firstbourne]]?

'''Wu''': Unlike you, I tell the truth.

'''Iron Baron''': How very... honorable of you. ''(He trips. Wu offers him a hand, but Iron Baron raises the [[Dragonbone Blade]] at him.)''

'''Wu''': ''(He looks up from the map, surprised.)'' The bridge is too brittle to hold us both.

'''Iron Baron''': ''(He holds the Dragon Blade at Wu.)'' Then you better tread lightly. ''(Wu steps forward. Instantly some rocks fall down. Iron Baron and Wu continue across the bridge. Wu steps on a rock step and it instantly lowers slightly.)'' Careful. ''(The rocks under Wu all lower slightly. Wu sees a wobbling stone and jumps over it. He lands and looks back at the unstable stone. Iron Baron tries to jump over, succeeding, but quickly loses balance. The stone gives away, Iron Baron falls down, only to be caught by Wu. Wu catches Iron Baron and pulls him up.)'' Keep moving. ''(Wu and Iron Baron walk towards safety as the rock path falls towards the ground.)'' That was the perfect chance to get rid of me, but you missed it.

'''Wu''': I gave you my word, remember? Once I get you the Armor, you send my ninja home.

'''Iron Baron''': There's nothing I would like more than for them to be gone. ''(Wu and Iron Baron walk off to find Firstbourne's nest.)''

(''The Dragon Hunters are busy arguing with each other.'')

'''Jet Jack''': You're not in charge! This is not your choice! Listen to me. You don't know anything! Everytime I suggestâ€” ''(Muzzle retorts back something.)'' Oh, come on!

'''[[Daddy No Legs]]''': Hey, he's just saying what we're all thinking.

'''Dragon Hunters''': Yeah!

'''Jet Jack''': Oh, yeah, and I suppose you think you should be in charge. (''Dragon Hunters on her side argue.)''

'''Kai, Cole, Zane, Jay, and Faith''': Team...work! Team...work! Team...work!

'''Kai''': It's working, guys! Just a little more.

'''Faith''': I can't believe this is working!

'''Jay''': We do have a little Faith!

'''Kai, Cole, Zane, Jay, and Faith''': Team...work! Team...work! Team... work! Team...

'''Jet Jack''': What do you think you're doing?

'''Jay''': Uh, nothing? ''(Jet Jack holds up her weapon.)'' They are going to eat us! ''(The Ninja all scream. Jet Jack cuts him down. The others are screaming while also being cut down.)''

'''Cole''': Ow. Ugh. Ever heard of stairs?

'''Faith''': I don't know if I should thank you, Jet Jack, or prepare to fight.

'''Kai''': Or if you're going to eat us, eat him first. ''(Points to Cole.)'' He's filled with [[cake]].

'''Cole''': ''(Stutters.)'' A-Am not!

'''Jet Jack''': We got to talking and this Dragon Armor business has gone ''too'' far.

'''Daddy No Legs''': Iron Baron speaks of serving his people, but he only serves himself.

'''[[Chew Toy]]''': Yeah, he's kind of a jerk.

'''Jet Jack''': We fear with Firstbourne by his side, he will become... unforgiving. ''(Dragon Hunters mutter in agreement.)''

'''Jay''': Wait, wait, you're telling me all this time, while they're getting closer to the nest, you guys are arguing about whether or not to release us?

'''Dragon Hunters''': ''(Shrug and nod.)'' Mhm.

'''Jet Jack''': He's shown his true colors, and they are colors no one likes. I can put aside our differences if you think you five can make a difference.

'''Cole''': We'll follow their tracks. Let's go and stop them, before it's too late!

'''Dragon Hunters and ninja''': ''(Cheer.)'' Yeah!! Yeah! Yeah!

''(Night has fallen. Kai, Jay, Cole, Zane, and Faith have arrived to find the destroyed rock path, unable to cross it.)''

'''Faith''': It's too late.

(''Iron Baron and Wu are searching for Firstbourne's nest''.)

'''Iron Baron''': This map is indecipherable. A mountain? What mountain?! They're everywhere!

'''Wu''': I know where the nest is. ''(He runs up a mountain.)''

'''Iron Baron''': ''(Stunned.)'' The nest of Firstbourne. ''(He tosses the map away.)'' And in it, your freedom and my power. Come now. Our future awaits. ''(He taps Wu in the back with The Dragon Blade. They enter the Firstbourne's nest.)''

----

(''In Ninjago, Garmadon is still searching and smashing buildings.)''

'''[[Ultra Violet]]''': ''(Talking on a telephone.)'' Ugh. I'm missing all the action. Will you just come and get me?! I don't know. It must've thrown me eight, maybe nine blocks. Yeah, it hurt.

'''Nya''': The battle wagon is just up ahead. ''(Ultra Violet pauses and listens, surprised, in her call. Nya, Dareth, Lloyd realize the quietness, and turn around to find Ultra Violet on the phone looking at them in surprise.)''

'''Ultra Violet''': ''(She smiles evilly, dropping the phone. She runs to them, calling out mockingly.)'' Heh heh. Green Nin-ja!

'''Nya''': Go. Get to the battle wagon.

'''Lloyd''': No. We stay together.

'''Nya''': Not this time. Now, go!

'''Ultra Violet''': Get outta my way, Water Lily!

''(A fight breaks out between them.)''

'''Dareth''': ''(Lloyd looks back.)'' If you wanna help Nya, we ''need'' the battle wagon. ''(Dareth and Lloyd carry Skylor off to the battle wagon.)''

''(The fight between Nya and Ultra Violet continues.)''

'''Ultra Violet''': Oh ho ho! (''She hops over a defeated Nya towards the [[Oni Mask of Hatred]] but Nya stops her.)''

''(The fight continues. Nya unfortunately gets trapped under a car. Ultra Violet''

'''Ultra Violet''': ''(Mask of Hatred on.)'' I'm impressed... It's a shame we couldn't be friends. ''(She gets ready to destroy Nya, but gets hit by a battle wagon.)''

'''Lloyd''': Nya! ''(He and Dareth lift the car off of her.)'' Are you hurt?

'''Nya''': My shoulder. ''(She pants heavily, holding her shoulder.)'' It's pretty bad.

'''Lloyd''': Let's get her to the battle wagon.

''(On the other side, Ultra Violet recovers only to find the mask split apart. She throws a fit on her way to the Ninja.)''

'''Nya''': Does she ever quit?

''(They watch Ultra Violent wobble and eventually fall down. [[Sons of Garmadon]] gang drive in and surround the rest of the Resistance.)''

----

''(In the First Realm, Iron Baron and Wu are looking for the Dragon Armor.)''

'''Iron Baron''': Wait... I cannot see a cursed thing in here. ''(He crashes into Wu and falls down.)'' Where is this Dragon Nest? ''(He gets back up with a torch in his hand.)''

'''Wu''': ''(Looks down.)'' I believe we're in it. ''(They see many [[dragons]].)''

'''Iron Baron''': ''(Gasps.)'' They are all asleep. Your Oni blood does not disturb them. Your Dragon blood keeps them docile. Look! ''(They see the Dragon Armor.)'' It's revealing itself to you. It wants to be found. (''They both walk towards the Dragon Armor, reaching the base.)'' Back away! It's mine! (''The Firstbourne wakes up. Iron Baron puts on the armor.)'' Ah. Yes. I have it! I wear the Dragon Armor! I command you, beast, destroy him!

'''Wu''': You know, I've learned a lot of things since I came to this realm.

'''Iron Baron''': What are you babbling about?!

'''Wu''': My [[ninja]] taught me responsibility, confidence, a sense of humor, and to listen to the voice within. But I also learned something from you.

'''Iron Baron''': Argh! Stand down! Kneel before me!

'''Wu''': You taught me the power of lies. You didn't really think the Dragon Armor is what made Firstbourne obey my father, did you? It was because of his heart. She sensed goodness in him. What does she sense in you?

''(Iron Baron throws the armor and a rock at Firstbourne. She encases him in molten lava and approaches Wu.)''

'''Wu''': It's okay. It's okay, now. ''(He pets Firstbourne's snout and she shows him the armor.)'' My Father's armor... ''(He takes it and the dragons bow to him.)''

''(Outside, the Dragon Hunters have caught up to the Ninja and Faith. Faith shakes her head slowly, letting them know of their failure. Suddenly, Firstbourne flies out from the mountain.)''

'''[[Arkade]]''': Firstbourne again!

'''Chew Toy''': Run for your lives!

'''Cole''': No, wait!

'''Kai''': Look!

''(Wu is revealed to be riding Firstbourne in the Dragon Armor.)'' 

'''Jay''': Woohoo! Yeah! All right! Way to go! ''(Laughs.)'' 

'''Jet Jack''': He's riding without chains? How is that possible?

'''Faith''': The Dragon Master doesn't need them.

''(Kai, Jay, Zane, Cole, and Faith all run to Wu.)''

'''Jay''': You did it! You actually did it!

'''Kai''': I always knew you had it in you!

'''Faith''': What about Iron Baron?

'''Wu''': Iron Baron's days are over. He showed his true colors and Firstbourne was not impressed.

'''Jet Jack''': He's gone? ''(The Dragon Hunters all cheer.)''

'''Zane''': You did well, Master.

'''Kai''': Or should we say... Dragon Master. ''(The ninja all bow to Wu.)''

'''Wu''': No, my friends. I bow to you. ''(Wu bows to the ninja.)'' It was your lessons that guided me.

'''Cole''': Hey, I don't mean to rain on the parade, but our job isn't done.

'''Jay''': He's right. We've got friends waiting for us!

'''Kai''': And a score to settle with Garmadon.

'''Zane''': Do you think Firstbourne can take us all home?

'''Wu''': That's up to them.

''(Firstbourne calls over four more dragons.)''

'''Cole''': Looks like we've found our answer.

''(Sadness dawns Faith as they realize the ninja are about to leave.)''

'''Wu''': Faith, we promised to bring you with us. You can ride with me.

'''Faith''': You kept your word, and that means the world to me. But I am needed here.

'''Kai''': I thought you hated this place.

'''Faith''': I did. But you taught me that with courage, things can change. And I would rather stay and fight for change in my home, than run. But I cannot do it alone.

'''Kai''': Faith, if you ever need help, you know you have friends in Ninjago.

'''Faith''': And you have friends here in the First Realm. ''(The ninja get on their dragons.)''

'''Kai''': Master Wu, get us home. ''(They start to fly.)'' Yee-haw! ''(Laughs.)''

'''Cole''': Man, I missed this.

'''Wu''': Everyone. Hold on!

''(They go into a portal.)''

'''Daddy No Legs''': Where did they go?

'''Faith''': Ninjago.
