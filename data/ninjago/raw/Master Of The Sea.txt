'''[[Benthomaar]]:''' Long before time had a name, the [[First Spinjitzu Master]] arrived on our world. A mere child, to find a world engulfed in chaos. This chaos was caused by [[Wojira]]. The Mighty Serpent of the [[Wave]] and the [[Storm]]. The First Spinjitzu Master knew, that for life to blossom in this realm, Wojira had to be stopped. With the help of the [[Keepers|islanders]] and the [[Merlopians]] who dwelled in the depths of the [[Endless Sea|sea]], they confronted Wojira. [[Battle of Nine Days|It]] was a fierce battle. Wojira was too powerful. All was lost, until [[Nyad]], the first [[Elemental Masters|Elemental Master]] of [[Water]], leapt on to the beast and saw with her own eyes the [[Amulets of Wojira|source]] of Wojira's power. Two [[Storm Amulet|strange]] [[Wave Amulet|objects]] which Wojira wore upon her forehead. Nyad knew what she had to do. And alone, Nyad could not stop Wojira. She had to become a greater power, the ocean itself. She merged with it, a state she could never return from. She sacrificed herself to save the world. As for the power of the Wave and the Storm, the First Spinjitzu Master gave the first to the king of the sea, and the second to the leader of the islanders for safekeeping. When the seas calmed and grew still, the First Spinjitzu Master created [[Ninjago]], and the world was in harmony. Balance. But now, my [[Kalmaar|brother]] seeks to change that. 

'''[[Nya]]''': He's got one amulet already. We can't let him get the other. 

'''Benthomaar''': With both, he will awaken Wojira and create a [[Fury of the Storm|wave of destruction]] not seen since [[Timeline#Pre-Ninjago|the dawn of time]]. 

'''[[Jay]]''': Can these [[whales]] go any faster? Time is sort of ticking here. 

'''Nya''': They're pulling as quickly as they can. Remember, it's their world that's at risk too. 

'''[[Lloyd]]''': Let's just hope Kalmaar hasn't been able to locate the second amulet. 

''(At [[Ninjago Harbor]], Kalmaar and his troops prepare to retreat into the sea.)'' 

'''Kalmaar''': Nothing can stop me now. Imagine this parched, dry [[Ninjago City|city]], submerged below the waves. Picture it, [[Gripe]]. Streets, turned into canals. Buildings and homes, flooded. Vehicles rusting away below the waves. A playground for fish and -- ''(Just as he turns around, [[Wu]] arrives and kicks him back.)'' 

'''Wu''': Now is not the time for amateur urban planning, foe. 

'''Kalmaar''': I will destroy you, old man. And when I say "I", I mean them. ''(He points towards his [[Maaray Guards]].)'' What are you looking at? I'm talking about you, you fools! 

'''Gripe''': Oh, yes. Forgive me, Sire. Attack! ''(The Merlopians start attacking, while [[Kai]] and the others arrive. Kai shoots [[fire]] at them, but it had no effect.)'' 

'''Kai''': Huh? 

'''[[Ray]]''': Haha! Two for one! Be fast, my boy! 

'''Kai''': Right back at you, pops! 

'''Ray''': Nice one, Kai! 

'''[[Cole]]''': Out of my way! Ha! 

'''Gripe''': Fire! Fire! 

'''Wu''': You're not leaving with that amulet, Kalmaar! 

'''Kalmaar''': Actually, I am. I'm literally doing that right now. Here, watch. Oh look! This is me, leaving with the amulet. ''(Suddenly, [[Misako]] swings in and kicks him.)'' 

'''Misako''': I'll get it! 

''(Misako tries to get the amulet, but is pulled back by Kalmaar. Slowly, the others are surrounded as well.)'' 

'''Kalmaar''': To [[Kalmaar's chariot|my chariot]]! 

''(Later, Wu and the others are tied together to an anchor.)'' 

'''Kalmaar''': Ninja. What does that even mean in [[Ninjargon|surface-dweller language]]? 

'''Wu''': A ninja is one who protects -- 

'''Kalmaar''': It was a rhetorical question, I don't really care. Drop the anchor! ''(Gripe does so, but it hits his foot and he hops around in pain.)'' Ugh, drop it in the water! 

'''Kai''': Get ready to hold your breath! 

'''Kalmaar''': Finally, the true Storm Amulet. Not that useless fake from the [[Island of the Keepers|island]]. See you in the deep, ninja. ''(He looks up to see the ninja rising up from the water.)''

'''Kai''': Wait, what? 

'''Kalmaar''': Huh? 

'''Cole''': The ''[[Hydro Bounty]]''! 

'''Kalmaar''': But, I left this ship stranded! 

'''Nya''': You did, but we got a bit of help from some friends. 

'''Kai''': Sis! Guys! Great entrance! ''(The others cut them lose and they defeat most of the Merlopians.)'' 

'''Kalmaar''': When I strand land-dwellers, they're supposed to stay stranded! 

'''Nya''': You know, I'm starting to really enjoy ruining all your evil plans! ''(She fights Kalmaar, but is defeated. Benthomaar comes to her aid.)'' 

'''Benthomaar''': Your mad dreams of awakening Wojira are over, Kalmaar! 

'''Kalmaar''': Brother! It's not too late for us to work together. As a family, against these surface fools! 

'''Benthomaar''': No! I will not fall for that ploy again! 

'''Kalmaar''': Ah, I don't need you to fall for it. Just distract you long enough for this! ''(He sends a blast at Benthomaar, which he dodges. However, Gripe hits him from behind.)'' Farewell, surface fools! 

'''Benthomaar''': Go! Stop him before he gets away! ''(Nya leaps onto a whale and has it pursue Kalmaar.)'' 

'''Kai''': Nya talks to whales now? 

'''Jay''': Yeah, it's a new thing. 

''(Under the ocean, Kalmaar sends two torpedoes at Nya, causing a giant explosion.)'' 

'''Jay''': Nya! Nya ... ''(Just then, Nya emerges from the water.)'' 

'''Benthomaar''': Nya! What happened? 

'''Nya''': Kalmaar got away. 

'''Benthomaar''': Then he will continue his senseless quest to awaken Wojira. 

'''Nya''': Well, he won't get far without this! ''(She reveals that she had taken the Storm Amulet back.)'' 

'''Jay''': Whoa! 

'''Wu''': The Storm Amulet. 

'''[[Maya]]''': Woo hoo! You did it, honey. You saved the city! 

'''Nya''': I couldn't have done it without you, Mom. ''(They share a hug while the others cheer.)'' 

''(Later, at the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu|Monastery]], Nya is showing Benthomaar around.)'' 

'''Nya''': And we do a lot of training here in the courtyard. Mostly because [[Lightning|Jay's powers]] started an electrical fire that destroyed the practice room, which he blamed on Kai. 

'''Benthomaar''': Your Monastery truly is a wonderful place. 

'''Nya''': The kind of wonderful where you could see yourself staying for a while? 

'''Benthomaar''': I don't understand. 

'''Nya''': I wasn't giving you a guided tour just for fun. I talked to Master Wu and the others, and ... we know your home is the sea, but with your brother still down there, we thought you might wanna stay with us for a while. 

'''Benthomaar''': You are inviting me to stay? With you? Here? 

'''Nya''': Yeah. I mean, only if you want to ... 

'''Benthomaar''': I would like that very much. Yes! 

'''Nya''': Great! We'll get you a good room. You'll never even hear Cole snoring. Oh well, maybe a little. 

''(In the [[Monastery of Spinjitzu/Rooms#Relaxation room|relaxation room]], Kai and Ray and playing [[Prime Empire]].)'' 

'''Kai''': So you're headed back home? 

'''Ray''': Yes. But, son, I value this time together more than I can say. 

'''Kai''': Me too. I'm gonna miss you, Dad. 

'''Nya''': Are you two seriously saying heartfelt goodbyes to one another, while playing a video game? 

'''Ray''': We've only got one level left. 

'''Kai''': Yeah. We started this together, and I really want to finish it before Dad leaves. 

'''Ray and Kai''': Fiyah. 

'''Maya''': Those two will never change. 

'''Nya''': Mom. You really have to go? 

'''Maya''': We've got lots of work waiting for us at the Smithy. And besides, I've caused you enough trouble here. 

'''Nya''': I was pretty mad when you stowed away on the sub. Now I'm glad you came. Glad we were together for this. 

'''Maya''': I realize now I should have believed in you more. You're a better Elemental Master than I ever was, and I'm glad I got to see that on one last adventure with you. 

'''Nya''': Who says this has to be our last adventure? ''(She runs forward and hugs Maya.)'' 

''(Later, Kai, Lloyd, Jay, [[Zane]], and Benthomaar are playing [[Pool|billiards]] in the relaxation room.)'' 

'''Benthomaar''': But what about the Storm Amulet? Where's it being kept? 

'''Lloyd''': You don't have to worry about that anymore. I promise, it's somewhere safe. 

'''Jay''': Yeah. You could say we put it somewhere ... ''out of reach''. 

'''Benthomaar''': But how can you be sure? 

'''Zane''': We have some experience in this department. We have come across one or two dangerous things before. 

'''Lloyd''': We've made some friends in ''high places''. 

''(At the [[Kingdom of Shintaro]], Cole is speaking with [[Vania]].)'' 

'''Vania''': Seal the vault and double the [[Army of Shintaro|guard]], [[Hailmar]]. 

'''Hailmar''': Yes, my Queen. But, what is it? 

'''Cole''': Something that must never see the light of day again. 

''(They turn and walk away, not noticing when a piece of the Storm Amulet breaks off, revealing it to be the fake one.)''
