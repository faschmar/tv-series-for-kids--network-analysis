''[Ronnie Anne and Sid are playing frisbee in the mercado.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Here it comes, Sid!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne throws it, and Sid jumps and catches it.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Ronnie Anne! Go long!"<br>
''[Sid spins around and throws it.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I got it!" ''[She runs to catch it, but crashes into a pile of cans. She gets out holding the frisbee.]'' "Aha!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Yeah!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Whoo! Score!" ''[Spikes the frisbee, and it lands next to a discarded coin purse.]'' "Uh-oh," ''[picks up the purse.]'' "someone dropped their change purse."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Bummeroni, I don't see anyone around. Who could it belong to?"<br>
''[Meanwhile, Bobby is pricing the groceries, cowboy style.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "This mercado ain't big enough for the two of us." ''[Bobby starts firing price stickers with very accurate precision, but soon gets a little carried away.]'' "Fastest pricer in town." ''[Attempts to put the sticker gun on his hip, but rips the side of his pants, causing them to fall off.]'' "Awe, dang it."<br>
''[Just then, Ronnie Anne and Sid, who are both covered in price stickers, come up to Bobby.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hey, Bobby, we just found this change purse. Any idea whose it could be?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "No clue, ''but'' I think we have a lost and found box around here somewhere."<br>
''[The sticker gun accidentally goes off, clamping Bobby's mouth shut. Bobby soon takes out the dusty lost and found box, and opens it revealing a pile of stuff.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Woah, how long has all that been in there?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Way before my time, I guess no one ever comes back for their stuff."<br>
''[Just then, Carl drops down on a rope, Bobby falls over in surprise.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Then can I take it? Maybe I can sell it for a quick buck."<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Gets up, with a serious expression.]'' "No Carl. What are you doing up there anyway?"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Takes out a water balloon.]'' "I'm playing water balloon tag with CJ;" ''[threateningly]'' "nobody blow my cover, or else." ''[Goes back up]''<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[To Ronnie Anne]'' "Maybe you should check inside the change purse, there might be a license in there."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Opens the purse]'' "Good idea. Woah, a hundred dollar bill."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Drops down]'' "Holy cashola." ''[Seeing a chance at free money.]'' "Uh, I just remembered, I lost my change purse this morning." ''[Tries to get the purse,]'' "Thank you for finding it."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Stops Carl]'' "Nice try, Carl." ''[Pushes him away, and he starts swinging out of control.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Should we put it in the Lost and Found?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I don't know, someone might really need this money." ''[Carl is about to puke]'' "We can't just toss it in some dusty old box, maybe we should try to find the owner."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Swings by]'' "I can prove it's mine! My bill had a picture of Abraham Washington on it."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "That's not even a real president."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Grabs onto the piñata.]'' "He is too!" ''[Suddenly he hears gushing. CJ is armed and has found him, Carl awkwardly laughs.]'' "Safe zone?"<br>
''[CJ nails Carl offscreen, the girls cringe, until Sid sees something fall out of the piñata.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Ooh, sweets." ''[Takes some candy off the ground.]''
----
''[The girls are outside the entrance to their building, Sid eating her candy.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Okay, first thing, let's check with everyone in the building, they all shop at the mercado."<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Puts the rest of her candy in her mouth.]'' "We got this."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne knocks on 4A, Mrs. Kernicky comes out, playing hacky sack, the girls applaud her and Sid takes out the purse, Mrs. Kernicky looks at it, and shakes her head, she kicks it back to Sid, Sid tries to do the same but kicks the purse into her own face. Next, they show the purse to Miranda, who's trying to swat a fly, she doesn't know who the purse belongs to; she manages to hit the fly, but the fly picks up the swatter and chases all three of them. At the next door, the girls avert their eyes, Mr. Nakamura and Nelson some out, while they were in the middle of giving themselves facials, Mr. Nakamura looks at the purse and shakes his head, Nelson eats his mud mask, and burps cucumber slices into Ronnie Anne's eyes.]''
----
''[In the mercado, Bobby comes out wearing a bunch of random things, Carl walks in.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "That's not a good look for you."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "This is all the stuff from the Lost and Found box, I thought if I put it on maybe the owners would recognize it when they come in."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Pshh, that's never gonna work, it's just a bunch of old junk."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "It will so work. In fact, I'll bet you dessert for the week that by the end of the day, all of this stuff will be claimed."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Are you sure you wanna do that? It's flan week." ''[Bobby squints at Carl, Carl squints back, and the two shake on it.]'' "Your palms are just as soft as I expected."
----
''[Elsewhere, Sid is putting up a sign for the change purse.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "With all these flyers, someone's gotta call."<br>
''[The girls pass a pizza restaurant, and the aroma fills them with desire.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Oh, my, gosh, that pizza smells so good."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Well, let's take a break and have a slice, all that running around made me hungry." ''[Realizes something]'' "Oh wait," ''[turns her pockets inside out.]'' "I don't have any money on me. Do you?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Nope," ''[holds up the purse]'' "just this unclaimed one-hundred dollar bill."<br>
''[The girls look at each other.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Well, maybe we could just borrow a little from the change purse."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Yeah, and obviously we replace whatever we spent ASAP."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Totally, we're good for it."<br>
''[The contents of the change purse go from one-hundred dollars, to ninety dollars.]''
----
''[Back at the mercado Vito walks up to Bobby.]''<br>
'''Vito:''' "Woah, look at this guy over here, wearing the whole closet at once."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "These items are from our Lost and Found. Does anything look familiar?"<br>
'''Vito:''' ''[Looks closely, and realizes.]'' "Hey, my sunglasses." ''[Takes them]'' "I forgot about these," ''[walks out]'' "you made my day kid." ''[Walks right into the wall and stumbles out.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "See, it totally worked."<br>
'''Carl:''' "You know he didn't pay for his groceries."<br>
''[Bobby realizes that and goes after Vito.]''
----
''[Back in the streets, the girl have put flyers up everywhere, they're walking along, Ronnie Anne finishing her slice of pizza.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Well, we covered the whole neighborhood, now we just wait for the owner to call." ''[Just then they bump into a guy dressed as half cowboy half clown, split right down the middle.]'' "Whoops, sorry."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Seeing a line of cowboys and clowns.]'' "Woah, what's going on?"<br>
'''Cowboy clown:''' "New game got released today, Cowboys vs. Clowns."<br>
''[The line leads right to the Galaxy Arcade.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne & Sid:''' "Ooh."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I heard that's supposed to be awesome. Should we borrow a little more money?"<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Takes out the purse.]'' "What's a few bucks more? We'll pay it back." ''[From ninety dollars, to seventy. The girls come out of the arcade.]'' "Whoo, twenty bucks goes fast in an arcade."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Especially if they have a photo booth." ''[Holds out a reel of film.]'' "But it's okay, because we're not going to borrow anymore money."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Nope, we gotta be responsib-" ''[looks over]'' "Oh my gosh," ''[The movie theatre is playing a new movie.]'' "Parade of the Penguins?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Woah, there's even a QnA with the penguins."<br>

''[Back at the mercado, Bobby takes off the earring, and gives it to it's rightful owner.]''<br>
'''Mrs. Flores:''' "Ah, thank you Bobby," ''[puts her earring on]'' "I thought Buttercup ate my missing earring," ''[Buttercup barks, and Mrs. Flores takes out a smelly doggy bag.]'' "I've been following her around for days hoping for the best. Now if I could just find my reading glasses." ''[Just then, Buttercup coughs those up.]'' "Ooh," ''[Mrs. Flores picks them up in disgust, puts them on, and wipes off the slobber, which lands in Carl's face.]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Your flan is mine."<br>
''[Carl growls]''

'''Sid:''' "I had no idea penguins could do autographs."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Me neither, and it only cost ten dollars." ''[Sixty dollars to fifty. Ronnie Anne checks her phone.]'' "Huh, still no calls about the change purse. Well, maybe we should just go home and wait."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Yeah, and no matter what else we see, we're not spending more money."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Even if it's amazing, pinky swear?"<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[As her pinky]'' "Ronnie Anne, I swear will never ever" ''[sees something else]'' "Oh my gosh!" ''[As herself]'' "Is that a Twelve is Midnight, k-pop, pop-up store?"<br>

'''Employee:''' "Blowout sale! Today only!"<br>
''[The girls are in awe.]''<br>
'''Sid's pinky:''' "But you guys swore."<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Intimidatingly]'' "Quiet you." ''[To her other hand]'' "Get him girls."<br>
''[Her left hand muffles her right pinky, and the girls excitedly run to the store, and spend the last of the money, Later they walk out of the store with their stuff.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Well, that's the end of the money, but these deals were too good to pass up."<br>
'''Sid:''' "I know, especially the Yoon Kwan waffle maker." ''[As Yoon Kwan]'' "I can't wait to be part of your balanced breakfast."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne laughs, and suddenly gets a call on her phone, from an unknown number.]''<br>

'''Maybelle:''' "Ronnie Anne, it's Maybelle, I saw your flyer about the change purse."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[To Sid, not liking where this is going.]'' "Uh oh."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "If it's brown with a gold clasp and a hundred dollars inside, it's mine."<br>
'''Sid:''' "I don't know, would we call it brown? Or is it more of a dark tan?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Sighs]'' "Yes Maybelle, it's yours."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Wonderful, I'll meet you at the mercado in two hours to pick it up."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Great." ''[Hangs up; aggitated]'' "Arrgh! Why did we have to spend all that money? I don't even like waffles."<br>
