''[Open on a flashback to Luna's first Mick Swagger concert from "[[For Bros About to Rock]]"]''<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[narrating]'' "There I was at my first concert, floating to the stage to rock with Mick Swagger himself." ''[Flashback Mick grabs young Luna's hand. Back to the present, where she's telling the story to the Moon Goats at Royal Woods High School.]'' "We just formed this amazing bond."<br>
'''Mazzy:''' "I totally get it. I feel the same way about my pet hamster." ''[said hamster is a spider]''<br>
'''Sully:''' "Uh, Mazz, that's a tarantula."<br>
'''Mazzy:''' "Either way, he loves the wheel I gave him.""<br>
'''Sam:''' "Luna, I love your Mick stories."<br>
'''Sully:''' "Ooh, tell the breadsticks one again."<br>
'''Luna:''' "Ah, the breadsticks. There I was..." ''[flashback to the events of "[[House Music]]"]'' "...struggling to write a song when this old man started dropping truth bombs on me. Little did I know it was Mick in disguise."<br>
''[The disguised Mick pulls down his fake beard and smiles. Flashback Luna gapes in surprise. Back to the present.]''<br>
'''Sully:''' "Ooh. I get goosebumps every time."<br>
'''Mazzy:''' "Hey, I bet you guys will make more memories at his concert tonight."<br>
'''Luna:''' "I will be close to him. Chunk scored us some awesome tickets."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[off-screen]'' "Guys, stop everything!" ''[runs up to Luna]'' "We have an epic crisis on our hands! The band we got for tomorrow's big 'Cut a Rug' dance just dropped out!"<br>
''[Shelby is literally cutting a rug]''<br>
'''Shelby:''' "Does that mean I can stop cutting?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Not yet, Shelby. As head of the dance committee, I've got a plan. Luna, can the Moon Goats play?"<br>
'''Mazzy:''' "Aw, we can't! I slipped in that puddle outside math class and sprained my wrist." ''[shows her wrist cast]'' <br>
'''Sully:''' "Yeah, and when I was taking Mazzy to the school nurse, I slipped in the puddle outside ''her'' office and sprained ''my'' wrist too." ''[shows his wrist cast]'' "This school's got a really odd puddle problem."<br>
'''Luna:''' "Well, I hope you guys find someone. I gotta jet. Time to get ready for Mick's concert." ''[leaves]''<br>
'''Sam:''' ''[gasps]'' "Luna, I just had the best idea: Get Mick to play the dance!"<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[stops]'' "Hng? Come again?"<br>
'''Sully:''' "He'd totally do it for you, Luna. You're mates!" ''[chuckles; to Mazzy]'' "That's how they say friends in British."<br>
'''Luna:''' "Uh, you know, I'd ask him, but I'm sure he's got a gig tomorrow night."<br>
'''Sully:''' "Actually, he doesn't have a gig tomorrow night; I just checked his website." ''[shows his phone]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Can you ask Mick?" ''[gives Luna puppy eyes]'' "Please?!"<br>
''[Luna tries to resist Leni's eyes]''<br>
'''Moon Goats:''' ''[chanting]'' "Go get Mick! Go get Mick!"<br>
''[Luna looks nervous]''
----
''[Night at Royal Woods Mall. Luna and Chunk are at the Mick Swagger concert]''
<center>
'''Mick:'''<br>♫''It was a hot June night<br>When she saw the light<br>Up until then she didn't know what was right<br>She showed...''♫
</center>
''[As the song continues, Luna is sullenly fist-pumping as Chunk head-bangs]''<br>
'''Chunk:''' "Your head's not into head-banging tonight. What's wrong, love?" ''[another fan lands into his arms, he chucks him out]''<br>
'''Luna:''' "My friends want me to get Mick to play the school dance because I let everyone believe we were mates. But what if he doesn't remember me?"<br>
'''Chunk:''' "Pfft! You're unforgettable!" ''[Hoists Luna up in the crowd]''<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[calls out to Mick]'' "Mick! Remember, the breadsticks?! You wanna play my high school dance?!" ''[turns to Chunk]'' "It's not working, Chunk."<br>
'''Chunk:''' ''[hands Luna a flashlight]'' "Hey, use me light."<br>
''[He hoists Luna with the flashlight]''<br>
'''Luna:''' "Mick!"<br>
''[She shines the flashlight into Mick's eyes]''<br>
'''Mick:''' "♫''A citizen of the rock and roll-''♫" ''[gets blinded]'' "Oh! Me peepers!"<br>
''[He stumbles into his amps and collapses, one of them falls onto him. Luna gets down and sheepishly throws the flashlight away.]''<br>
'''Luna:''' "New plan." ''[attempts to crowd surf, but they carry her away from Mick]'' "Other way, dudes! You're taking me to the Swagger swag booth!" ''[the crowd throws her to Chunk]''<br>
'''Chunk:''' "I've got ya, love."<br>
'''Luna:''' "Thanks, Chunk." ''[Thinks]'' "Hey, what if I just slip him a note backstage?"<br>
'''Chunk:''' "You'd need a VIP pass to get you backstage, love. Lucky for you, I've got an old roadie trick for that."
----
''[Later, Chunk and Luna are disguised as pizza delivery workers and sneak in from the alley]''<br>
'''Chunk:''' "Here's our VIP pass: Very Important Pizza. Got the note?"<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[reads the note]'' "''Dear Mick, it's your mate and number one fan, Luna Loud. It would be the coolest thing ever if you play my school dance tomorrow night. Rock on.''"<br>
''[She slips the letter in the pizza box. The two approach the VIP guard]''<br>
'''Chunk:''' "Oi, pizza delivery for Mr. Swagger."<br>
'''Security Guard:''' "Hold it."<br>
''[The two freeze]''<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[Winces]'' "Nyah!"<br>
'''Security Guard:''' "Uh, what about the, uh, red pepper flakes?"<br>
''[Luna and Chunk sigh]''<br>
'''Chunk:''' "It's a good thing I have extra pizza toppings on me. A roadie's always got to be prepared." ''[hands the toppings to the guard, including a whole pineapple]'' "I even got pineapple if you want to get wild."<br>
'''Security Guard:''' "You need to leave."<br>
''[Meanwhile Mick Swagger finishes up his song]''<br>
'''Mick:''' "♫''Yeah, yeah, yeah, suga, sugaye!''♫" ''[The crowd cheer.]'' "Yeah! Goodnight, Royal Woods!"
----
''[Later that night, Mick throws his pizza away, throws the box in the trash and walks away. Luna and Chunk check from the alley and sneak back in]''<br>
'''Luna:''' "Now that everyone's gone, let's make sure Mick got my note." ''[Opens the box, the note's still there]'' "Oh no! He threw it away! How am I gonna tell everyone that Mick's not playing the dance?!"<br>
'''Chunk:''' "Uh, sorry, love. Do you wanna share this pizza crust?"<br>
'''Luna:''' "Uh, Chunk, there's lipstick on that crust."<br>
''[Chunk shrugs and eats it anyway]''
----
''[The next day at high school.]''<br>
'''Sam:''' "Luna, how'd it go? Mick must have been so happy to see you."<br>
'''Sully:''' "Did you talk about the breadsticks? What am I saying? Of course you did! Anyway, we're pumped to see him play!"<br>
'''Luna:''' "Actually, I need to talk to you dudes about that..."<br>
'''Mazzy:''' "Hold that thought. We need to show you something."<br>
''[The Moon Goats make it to the gym. Luna gasps while she looks at the new Mick Swagger-theme. Shelby and Leni notice the Moon Goats]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Hey!<br>
'''Shelby:''' "What do you think? We ditched the rug theme and went ''full'' Mick Swagger."<br>
'''Leni:''' "It took all night and most of the school's puddle repair budget, but worth it!"<br>
'''Mazzy:''' "Yeah! The whole school is super stoked for the dance now."<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[Nervous]'' "Uh, ''whole'' school?"<br>
'''Principal Rivers:''' "Ooh! There's my hero! Thanks to you getting Mick, I'm no longer known as the principal of the school with the odd puddle problem."<br>
''[Smiles and walks away. Luna whimpers in fear as tense music plays.]''<br>
'''Sam:''' "Oh, hey, what was that you were gonna tell us in the hallway?"<br>
'''Luna:''' "Uh, nothing! I mean, I found another puddle. Um, maybe I should tell Principal Rivers."<br>
''[Leaves]''
----
''[Luna is shivering near Chunk's van]''<br>
'''Chunk:''' "Can't you just tell your friends that you couldn't get Mick?"<br>
'''Luna:''' "It's beyond that, dude! Everybody in school thinks he's coming! Ugh! What was I thinking?" ''[sarcastically imitates Mick]'' "'Oh, hey, Luna, of course I'll play your dance. I don't have anything better to do. I'm just the biggest rock star on the planet.'"<br>
'''Chunk:''' "On the plus side, you'd do a right great Mick impersonation."<br>
'''Luna:''' "Thanks, dude. I guess that's something." ''[realizes]'' "Wait, that is something!"
----
''[That night at the gym.]''<br>
'''Principal Rivers:''' "Hey, kids, the gym looks great. I love your outfits. Enough with the chit-chat, where's Mick? I need a selfie with him to send all the other principals in town."<br>
'''Luna:''' "Oh, uh, he's already backstage. He really needs his alone time before a show. Only close mates allowed." ''[giggles]''<br>
'''Principal Rivers:''' "Oh, of course. Must respect the artist's process." ''[leaves]''<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[to Sam]'' "I'm gonna go check on Mick."<br>
'''Sam:''' "Hurry. I want to watch the show together."<br>
''[Luna hurries backstage]''<br>
'''Chunk:''' ''[Gives Luna Mick's jacket]'' "All right, here's your outfit. I've got all Mick's songs ready on me laptop. All you gotta do is go out there and lip-sync."<br>
'''Luna:''' "Got it. Let's hope this works."<br>
'''Chunk:''' "Up-bup-bup. Don't forget your Mick mullet!" ''[Shoves a wig on Luna]'' "Break a leg!"<br>
'''Principal Rivers:''' ''[Laughs]'' "Let's give a warm welcome to Mick Swagger!" ''[Luna arrives in Mick Swagger costume]'' "Where's your band, Mick?"<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[imitating Mick]'' "Uh, they all got a case of tour lice. Best they play behind a curtain, love."<br>
'''Principal Rivers:''' "Oh, uh, ''[Laughs]'' good thinking. OK, smile!" ''[takes a selfie with Luna]''<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[imitating Mick]'' "Hello, Royal Woods High! Are you ready to rock?!"<br>
'''Audience:''' "Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick!"<br>
''[Luna gives the signal, and Chunk plays a song. She lip-syncs to Mick's vocals]''<br>
<center>
♫''Gotta be in two places at the same time<br>It's a real big challenge<br>Just like a steep, hard mountain climb<br>Gettin' double vision from doin' double time<br>Like tryna be a lemon while you're tryna be a lime<br>Got a show in Miami and another in-''♫
</center>
''[Luna notices Sam is alone. She panics and has Chunk turn off the music.]''<br>
'''Luna:'''  ''[imitating Mick]'' "I'll be back in a tick. Just gotta use the loo."<br>
''[She rushes backstage and turns back to normal. She then hurries next to Sam]''<br>
'''Sam:''' "There you are. Mick's awesome so far."<br>
'''Luna:''' "Oh yeah. I saw it from backstage."<br>
'''Sam:''' "Should we get some punch before he goes back on?"<br>
'''Luna:''' "You know, I'll get it for us."<br>
''[She goes backstage, turns back into Mick, and goes back on stage before lip-syncing again.]''<br>
<center>
♫''Gotta be in two places at the same time<br>It's a real big challenge<br>Just like a steep, hard mountain-''♫
</center>
''[Luna sees Sam looking impatient, panics, and has Chunk turn off the music]''<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[imitating Mick]'' "Blimey, me guitar string popped. BRB." ''[turns back to normal and gives Sam the punch. Still imitating Mick]'' "Here you go, love." ''[realizes; normal]'' "I mean, here, Sam." ''[notices Sam looking down]'' "You OK?"<br>
'''Sam:''' "Yeah, it's just that when I said I wanted to watch Mick Swagger with-- you, I meant with you.<br>
'''Luna:''' "Uh..."<br>
'''Audience:''' "--Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick!"<br>
'''Sam:''' "You know?"<br>
'''Luna:''' "BRB!"<br>
''[She dashes back on stage faster than Sam can even look up from her drink and realize she's alone again. Luna puts the disguise back on]''<br>
'''Chunk:''' "In you go, love."<br>
''[Luna rushes on stage, but she spills punch on Chunk's laptop. It malfunctions, causing Chunk to yelp. Mick's vocals are rushed, and Luna can't catch up as her guitar starts smoking. Soon she trips, revealing the ruse as Chunk gets shocked by the laptop. Luna peeks her head from curtain, revealing her disguise. Everyone gasps]''<br>
'''Sam:''' "Luna, what is going on? Have you been performing as Mick all night?!"<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[Defeated]'' "Yeah. I tried to get him to play the dance, but I couldn't."<br>
'''Principal Rivers:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "Great. Now I'm back to being Principal Puddles."<br>
'''Sam:''' "Luna, why did you do this?"<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[Sighs]'' "I told you guys that Mick and I had this amazing bond, and you all thought it was so cool. But the truth is, I couldn't get Mick to play, because we're not mates. He doesn't even know who I am."<br>
''[The door opens]''<br>
'''Mick:''' ''[off-screen]'' "There's my breadstick girl!" ''[Luna gasps as Mick has really come with his band]'' "Hello, Luna, love." ''[The entire audience can't believe it either]'' "Whoa, we're twinsies. Smashing!"<br>
'''Luna:''' "Mick, you showed up!"<br>
'''Mick:''' "Of course! I read your greasy letter in the pizza box. Besides, it's not a complete trip to Royal Woods if I don't see Luna Loud. I'm sorry we're late. You didn't write down the address, so we've been to every high school in the Tri-County Area. I hope we can still play the dance."<br>
'''Principal Rivers:''' "You can, and you will. Selfie!"<br>
''[She takes a selfie with the real Mick, who is startled.]''<br>
'''Mick:''' "Luna, since you're already in me duds, how about you join me for a double Mick duet?"<br>
''[Luna squeals and smiles. Later, Mick's band, now with Luna singing alongside Mick, performs]''<br> 
<center>
'''Luna and Mick:'''<br>♫''Doin' double duty<br>Yeah, I'm pullin' two shifts<br>Is it hard, yes absolutely<br>I'm just doin' double duty<br>Doin' double duty<br>It's worth takin' the risk<br>Workin' off my booty''♫<br>'''Luna:'''<br>♫''Just doin' double duty''♫
</center>
''[Mick goes sliding on a puddle and ends up in Principal Rivers' arms]''<br>
'''Principal Rivers:''' "For once, our puddle problem worked out for me."<br>
''[Sam approaches Luna on stage]''<br>
'''Sam:''' "What did I tell you? Best dance ever."<br>
'''Luna:''' ''[dips Sam; in her Mick impression]'' "Thanks, love."
