''[Great Lakes City, inside the Mercado. Bobby is handing Vito his bag of supplies.]''<br />
'''Bobby''': "Thanks, Vito. Have a great day."<br />
'''Vito''': "I-I will if this itch cream works."<br />
''[Vito leaves a splat of itch cream on the door. Bobby notices the splat.]''<br />
'''Bobby''': "Oh..."<br />
''[Bobby gets a call from Lori.]''<br />
'''Lori''': "Eee! Boo-Boo Bear, how excited are you for our anniversary tomorrow?"<br />
''[Bobby cleans off the splat.]''<br />
'''Bobby''': "So excited, babe! I can't wait to celebrate the first time we ever ate pizza together. Tia Frida even made me a special pizza tux."<br />
'''Lori''': "Aww, that's so romantic! You still wanna go to Gus's Games & Grub?"<br />
'''Bobby''': "Of course! That's where it all started. Remember how we shared a large pepperoni?"<br />
'''Lori''': "Oh, yeah. You bit into it and burned the left side of your tongue!"<br />
''[Lori looks at a picture of them in the hospital, Lori holding a pizza box and Bobby laying down on a hospital bed with a burned covered-up tongue.]''<br />
'''Bobby''': "Oh, yeah! That hurt so bad. So, I'll pick you up tomorrow?"<br />
''[Lori puts down the picture.]''<br />
'''Lori''': "Can't wait. Bye, Boo-Boo Bear!"<br />
''[Bobby hangs up, but then realizes something. Hector walks by.]''<br />
'''Bobby''': "Abuelo! Just the man I needed to see. Lori and I are celebrating our pizza-versary tomorrow. Can you cover my shift?" <br />
'''Hector''': "I'm sorry, Roberto, but I'll be at the Big Mercado Convention." ''[shows the flyer]'' "This year, they're giving out door chimes!" <br />
'''Bobby''': "Oh, well, you don't wanna miss that. I'll just have to break it to Lori, and Tia Frida. She was really excited about the pizza tux." <br />
'''Hector''': "Don't be ridiculous! Go see Lori! There are plenty of people in this family who can watch the Mercado." <br />
''[Outside, Carl licks the glass part of the door, while Ronnie Anne and CJ are laughing, which Bobby takes a stern eye on.]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': "Are there?" <br />
''[Carl, Ronnie Anne, and CJ enter the mercado, while Bobby tries to clean the part Carl licked on. Ronnie Anne and CJ are seen having a sword fight with the jerkies.]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': "No swordfighting with the jerky!" <br />
'''Hector''': "Niños, Roberto needs a favor. Can you watch the mercado for him tomorrow so he can celebrate Lori's pizza birthday?" <br />
'''Bobby''': "Pizza-versary, abuelo!" <br />
'''Carl''': ''[pops out while chewing gum]'' "Sure! I love working here!" <br />
'''Bobby''': "No! You love eating all the candy and getting everything sticky!" ''[shakes Carl upside down, releasing the chewing gum he ate, much to his dismay, then pushes Hector away from them]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': "Are you sure we can trust them to handle it? The Mercado's a big responsibility." <br />
'''Hector''': "They'll be fine, Bobby. The Mercado is in their blood." <br />
'''Ronnie Anne''': "Okay, new game! Piñata racing!" <br />
''[Ronnie Anne, CJ, and Carl race using piñatas as 'horses'. They laugh until Carl's piñata broke, to which he laughs as he doesn't know about it.]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': ''[facepalms]'' "Aw..."
----
''[Next day at the Mercado. Carl, CJ and Ronnie Anne are disgusted.]'' <br />
'''Carl''': "What are you wearing?" <br />
'''Bobby''': "What? Haven't you ever seen a pizza tux?" ''[holds a milk carton]'' "Now listen carefully. When the new milk is delivered, put it behind the old milk, and face the carton so the date can be clearly read." <br />
''[It is revealed that Ronnie Anne, Carl, and CJ play with the sunglasses, with one of them in Carl's butt, and Ronnie Anne and CJ laugh along.]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': Hey! Put those back! Now, there's a lot more you need to know, so I put it in this quick reference guide. <br>
''[Carl grabs the guide and rubs his butt on it.]'' <br>
'''Carl''': Look! I'm reading it right now! <br>
''[CJ and Ronnie Anne laugh along with Carl. Infuriated, Bobby shakes his head.]'' <br>
'''Bobby''': That's it! I'm staying here! <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': Bobby, go! You're gonna be late. We got this. <br>
''[Ronnie Anne pushes Bobby out of the Mercado, while Bobby grasps on the wall to prevent Ronnie Anne from successfully doing it.]'' <br>
'''Carl''': Yeah. I could run this place in my sleep. People bring groceries to the counter, we take their money, I eat a fist full of Chewy Chewies. <br>
'''Bobby''': That you buy at the employee discount rate? <br>
''[Ronnie Anne successfully pushes Bobby away after she used his hips to fling him like a slingshot.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': Goodbye, Bobby! <br>
----
''[Bobby drives to Royal Woods.]'' <br>
'''Bobby''': "I'm comin', babe! Oh no! I forgot to tell them something." ''[To his phone]'' "Phone, call Ronnie Anne." <br>
''[Bobby's phone calls Ronnie Anne. Meanwhile, Carl laughs while doodling on a picture of Bobby and Lori. Ronnie Anne's phone rings.]'' <br>
'''Carl''': "Huh?" <br>
''[Ronnie Anne answers it. Carl and CJ come over with her.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': "Hey Bobby, what's up?" <br>
'''Bobby''': ''[sweats nervously]'' "I forgot to tell you. The restrooms are for customers only. They gotta buy something." <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': "That's why you called? OK, I think we got it, Bobby. Adios." <br>
''[As Ronnie Anne hangs her call with Bobby, it rings right after.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': "What now?" <br>
'''Bobby''': "If anyone comes in for walnuts-" <br>
'''Carl''': "No one will! Walnuts are the worst nut!" <br>
''[Par enters the mercado, while he lifts two mangoes as an exercise.]'' <br>
'''Par''': "Ah, hey guys! Where do you want these mangoes? Just gettin' in a quick set!" <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': "Thanks Par. Just set them by the fish." <br>
'''Bobby''': "No! Not by the fish! They'll absorb the fish smell. And don't let Par do any more exercises with the fruit." <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': "Bobby, quit worrying. We've got this." ''[ends her call with Bobby]''
----
''[Bobby stops at a gas station.]'' <br>
'''Bobby''': "I'll just do a visual check in, yeah." <br>
''[As he glances at the mercado, an upbeat music is heard. CJ is shown laughing with two sticks on both of his hands. Maybelle is then seen eating grapes.]'' <br>
'''Bobby''': "Ugh! I told Maybelle she can't just sample the grapes like that." <br>
''[Ronnie Anne walks with Carl on her back, while he tries to reach the Chewy Chewies jar. Bobby becomes nervous, until he sees a distant telephone station.]'' <br>
'''Bobby''': "Yes! Yes!" <br>
''[Carl tries to reach the Chewy Chewies jar.]'' <br>
'''Carl''': "Yeah! Ha-ha!" <br>
''[Ronnie Anne's phone rings, causing both of them to fall down.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': "One guess who it is." ''[answers the call]'' <br>
'''Bobby''': "Hey! I told you to stay away from those Chewy Chewies! There better be 97 when I get back!" <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': "Huh?" <br>
''[Carl regurgitates all the Chewy Chewies, much to Ronnie Anne's disgust.]'' <br>
'''Bobby''': And you have a code purple! Maybelle is eating grapes! <br>
[As Bobby talks on the phone, Maybelle eats a grape.]'' <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': "How do you know all of that?" <br>
'''Bobby''': "Uh... Mercado instinct! Hey, did you change my music? Bobby's Mercado Mix Number 7 was carefully selected to stimulate more shopping." <br>
''[As Bobby talks on the phone, Ronnie Anne takes a look at a security camera located in the piñata's eye.] <br>
'''Ronnie Anne''': "Mercado instinct, huh? More like you're spying on us with the security camera!"<br>
'''Bobby''': "Wait! I'm not spying! What... What are you doing?!"<br>
''[Carl covers the camera with gum and it black out, as the phone hangs up]''<br>
'''Bobby''': "They cut me off! What am I gonna do?"
----
''[Bobby arrives at the Loud House.]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': ''[aggressively knocks at the door, then groans]'' "A hundred people live here and no one answers the door?" <br />
'''Lori''': ''[opens the door]'' "Hi, Boo Boo Bear. Ooh, cute tux! It goes great with my side salad scarf." <br />
'''Bobby''': "Come on babe, no time to waste!" ''[carries Lori with his both hands to the van]'' <br />
'''Lori''': "Ooh, I love this new take  charge attitude." ''[blushes]'' <br />
''[Immediately, they left Royal Woods and head over back to Great Lakes City]'' <br />
'''Lori''': "Uh wait, where are we going? Gus' is that way." <br />
'''Bobby''': "Surprise! I'm going to take you to the best pizza place in the city. Nothing's too good for my little garlic knot." <br />
'''Lori''': "Aww..." <br />
''[They both arrive at Amores Pizza. Lori goes out of the van.]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': "Why don't you find us a table while I park the van? BRBB." <br />
'''Lori''': "Be right back. What's the extra 'B' for?" <br />
'''Bobby''': "Babe." <br />
''[Lori blushes and laughs, then Bobby drives the van back to the Mercado.]''
----
''[Bobby dashes into the Mercado]''<br />
'''Ronnie Anne''': "Bobby?"<br />
'''Bobby''': "That's right!" ''[removes the gum off the camera]'' "I don't appreciate being cut off!" ''[shakes the gum off his hand]'' "Yuck! From communication!"<br />
'''Ronnie Anne''': "Well, we didn't appreciate you spying on us. We've all helped out here and know what to do. Look around! Nothing went wrong."<br />
'''Bobby''': "How can you say that?! The mangos smell like trout! The milk is facing the wrong way! This can is off by a centimeter!"<br />
'''Ronnie Anne''': "You're being so picky! That stuff doesn't matter!"<br />
'''Bobby''': "It matters to me! I don't need a bunch of kids coming in here and changing everything! You'll understand when you're older!"<br />
'''Ronnie Anne''': "Oh, ho, ho! I think we understand now! You're just like a Mercado run in a very specific way!" ''[takes her apron off and gives it to Bobby]'' "So, run it yourself!" ''[walks out]''<br/>
'''Carl''':  ''[speaks simultaneously with CJ]'' "Yeah, we quit!" <br />
'''CJ''': ''[simultaneous with Ronnie Anne]'' "We're done!" <br />
'''Carl''': "Later, jefe." <br />
'''Bobby''': ''[nervous]'' "Now what? I can't close the mercado. Par's gonna need his post-workout protein bar soon. And, Mr. Chang's gonna need his coffee for his night shift. Plus, Lori's waiting on me..." ''[realizes]'' "Oh no, Lori! ''[dashes on the Mercado]'' "Maybelle, I'll be right back." <br />
'''Maybelle''': ''[eats a bunch of grapes]'' "Take your time!"
----
''[Back at Amores Pizza]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': "Sorry it took so long, babe." <br />
'''Lori''': ''[examines Bobby carefully]'' "Anyway, I was thinking we could get half cheese and half pepperoni." <br />
'''Bobby''': "Oh! Cashews cost a fortune!" <br />
'''Lori''': "I-I said cheese." <br />
'''Bobby''': "Oh, great. Let's- Let's just get that done." ''[laughs, then realizes]'' "What's this? One dinky flower?" ''[throws it away]'' "My babe deserves a bouquet. BRBB with a B. The last B is for 'bouquet'." ''[runs]''
----
''[Back at the Mercado]'' <br />
'''Maybelle''': "You know, Bobby, we don't have time to be waitin' around for you like this." <br />
'''Vito''': ''[scratches his cheeks]'' "Ah, yeah. I need more itch cream!" <br />
'''Bobby''': "So sorry, it won't happen again. So, that'll be 12 dollars for all the cashews you ate, and..." <br />
'''Maybelle''': "Wait! This mango has a bruise. Let me pick out a new one. It's still my turn, no cutsies." <br />
''[As Maybelle picks up a mango, Bobby becomes more nervous. Eventually, he starts to hallucinate about Lori as he looks at the watch.]'' <br />
'''Lori (imagination)''': "Bobby, where are you?" <br />
''[Bobby becomes more nervous, and as Maybelle turns the mango at him, it shows a picture of Lori.]'' <br />
'''Lori (imagination)''': "Bobby, you are literally making me wait!" <br />
''[Bobby's nervousness continue, this time, he starts to hallucinate faces of pizza on his customers.]'' <br />
'''Vito (imagined as a pizza)''': "You're sweating a lot." <br />
'''Bobby''': ''[nervously gasps]'' "Oh! You know what? I'll BRBB!" <br />
'''Maybelle''': "You'll what?" <br />
'''Bobby''': "Be right back ba...by powder is on aisle three. ''[laughs nervously]'' Oh, no, wait, flowers, ah!" ''[runs away]''
----
''[Scene transitions to a delighted couple, then to Lori enviously staring at them. Bobby rushes with a broccoli in the vase]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': "There! That's better." <br />
'''Lori''': "That's broccoli. Are you okay?" <br />
'''Bobby''': "Oh, oh yeah, yeah, I-I'm just excited for our date." <br />
'''Lori''': "Well, the food got here. Try this." <br />
''[Bobby and Lori are chewing the pizza together. As they slurp its cheese, Bobby takes a peek on the phone. Realizing something, he becomes shocked, and he lets go of the cheese, causing them to be stuck in Lori's face along with the pizza.]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': "Sorry, babe. My... pepperoni cufflinks are coming off. Be right back!" ''[runs away]'' <br />
''[Lori rips off the cheese and pizza stuck in her head and becomes angry.]''
---
''[Back to the Mercado; Bobby rushes in and proceeds to the cashier immediately.]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': "Ah!" <br />
'''Maybelle''': "See, Bobby? Look at this mango! It's perfect. All right, quit standin' in there, you're gonna overripe it!" <br />
'''Lori''': ''[opens the door]'' "I KNEW IT!!! You were with your other love on our ANNIVERSARY?!" <br />
'''Bobby''': "No! Maybelle and I are just friends." <br />
'''Maybelle''': "Maybe if I was, fifty years younger." <br />
'''Lori''': "I mean the Mercado, Bobby! ARRGH!!" ''[storms off]''<br />
'''Bobby''': "No, Lo-Lo-Lori!" ''[runs after her]'' "LORI!!!" ''[goes outside the Mercado]'' "Babe! I'm sorry. I didn't mean for tonight to turn out like this." <br />
'''Lori''': "I can't believe you drove me all the way to the city just so you could work on our anniversary!" <br />
'''Bobby''': "That wasn't the plan! It was supposed to be a really special night. I left Ronnie Anne, Carl, and CJ in charge of the Mercado, but they were messing things up. They changed the music to K-pop, and they put the mangos by the fish?!" <br />
'''Lori''': "That's it? So they didn't upset any customers? Burn the place down?" <br />
'''Bobby''': "No, but-" <br />
'''Lori''': "Bobby, everyone in your family cares about the Mercado. No one would ever let anything truly bad happen to it." <br />
'''Bobby''': "Right, but-" <br />
'''Lori''': "Maybe, they have their own way of doing things, and you just need to trust them." <br />
'''Bobby''': ''[realizes]'' "You're right. I'm sorry. I guess I do have a hard time giving up control of the Mercado." <br />
'''Lori''': ''[holds Bobby's hand]'' "It's okay. You're just, really passionate about what you do, and I love that about you. Also, you look really cute on your pizza tux." <br />
'''Bobby''': "Thanks, babe. Let me make this night up for you. BRBB." <br />
'''Lori''': "Ugh..." <br />
'''Bobby''': "Last one!" ''[storms off]''
----
''[Living room of the house. Carl, CJ, and Ronnie Anne are watching a movie.]'' <br />
'''Movie Character''': "There's only one way to stop this chupacabra. And that is-" <br />
''[Bobby turns off the TV at the last minute, upsetting all three of them]'' <br />
'''Carl''': "Now we'll never know!" <br />
'''Bobby''': "Guys, I'm sorry for not trusting you to watch the Mercado. You did a great job. You think we could have a do-over so I can take Lori to dinner? I promise not to spy on you. Unlimited Chewy Chewies..." <br />
'''CJ (simultaneous)''': ''[raises his hand]'' "I'll do it!" <br />
'''Carl (simultaneous)''': ''[raises his hand]'' "I'm in!" <br />
'''Bobby''': "And Ronnie Anne, you can listen to whatever you want. Blast that K-pop!" <br />
'''Ronnie Anne''': "Okay, deal. But where are you gonna take her this late? The pizza place is closed." <br />
'''Bobby''': "Hmm... Ah!"
----
''[Rooftop of the house. Lori and Bobby have their pizza-versary.]'' <br />
'''Lori''': "Oh, Boo Boo Bear, this is so romantic, and these pizza tacos your Abuela made, are delicious." ''[eats a pizza taco]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': "Thanks, babe. I'm just glad we're finally celebrating our pizza-versary the way you deserve!" <br />
'''Lori''': "Thanks, Boo Boo Bear. Literally, best pizza-versary ever!" <br />
''[A bird draws closer on Bobby, and bites on one of his pepperoni cufflinks]'' <br />
'''Bobby''': "Uh-oh! Maybe Tia Frida shouldn't have used ''real'' pepperonis." <br />
''[More birds come to bite on his cuffllinks, causing his left part of the pizza tux to rip off. It is revealed that a lot of birds are above Bobby's head waiting to take a bite on what they presume as pizza, leaving Bobby anxious. End]''
