{{Transcript}}
''[At Joe's Arcade, CJ and Carl are playing Wham-A-Rat. Carl yells and attempts to hit some rats but fails. CJ touches him and proceeds to hit all the rats with focus, even spinning his mallet in style.]''<br>
'''Announcer:''' "Player 2 wins."<br>
''[Carl slams his mallet in anger, but is sent flying by the force. Their parents then arrive, with Carlitos strapped to Carlos' back]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Wham-A-Rat, I played this as a kid. Mind if we join you for a round?"<br>
'''Frida:''' "The whole familia, whamming ratas! I cherish these moments..."<br>
''[Frida howls in anger and starts whamming rats as Carlitos notices a particular toy being picked in the claw game; a penguin, which talks to him]''<br>
'''Penguin:''' "Hi, Carlitos! I'm Mr. Fluff. I want to be your best friend."<br>
''[Carlitos gets hearts in his eyes as he enters a fantasy sequence of him having fun with Mr. Fluff. The two stand in a spotlight and tango together before jumping down a cloud. Carlitos then rides Mr. Fluff down a rainbow, ride a bicycle together past ice cream, and float downwards about to grab each other. However, Carlitos is jolted back into reality as Mr. Fluff is dropped by the claw. It turns out Carlitos had dragged Carlos to the claw machine, and Alexis was playing the game.]''<br>
'''Alexis:''' "Oh, so close. Hey, Carlitos. Cute toy, huh? I'm gonna need more quarters." ''[leaves the game]'' "Mommy!"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Oh, sorry, Carlitos, but nobody wins those claw games. They're rigged."<br>
''[Refusing, Carlitos clings on to the game as Carlos pulls him, dragging the game across the room, with the staff trying to pull it back, until Frida breaks the fight up, causing Carlos to fall over.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "I think somebody needs a nap."<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Breathing heavily]'' "Me!"<br>
''[He hops onto Frida's back as the Casagrandes continue walking. They walk past Vito, who is confused while playing a dancing game.]''
----
''[At the house, a miserable-looking Carlitos is carried to his crib.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Aww, pobrecito." ''[Gives a teddy bear to him.]'' "Here's your osito. He'll make you feel ''much'' better."<br>
''[Carlos and Frida leave the room. Carlitos walks and sits away from the teddy and closes his eyes. Meanwhile, a silhouette of Mr. Fluff appears above his head. Carlitos turns around, opens his eyes and wonders what's happening. Mr. Fluff pops out as a hologram...]''<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' "Hi, Carlitos!" ''[...delighting the baby, and drops down in the middle of the cot. Carlitos goes to hug the hologram, only for it to disappear, causing him to trip over and become miserable again. He then sees the hologram lying on the bed, waving at him; however, it disappears again, turning into a pile of towels. He lies down and sucks his thumb, becoming nervous. However, the hologram pops up behind him; distracted, he turns over.]'' "Peek-a-boo." ''[The hologram disappears as Carlitos tries to hug him. He sits up and flails his arms as it re-appears again.]'' "The real me is still inside that claw game. You have to get to the arcade and save me so we can be best friends forever, okay? But first, you'll need a disguise, to get past your family."<br>
''[Mr. Fluff disappears once more. Carlitos starts thinking. Then he has an idea and turns to his teddy.]''
----
''[Meanwhile, Lalo is asleep with teddy waddling scattered around the room. The camera pans to Carlitos, who is revealed to be trying the teddy bear on like a onesie. He jumps out of the cot via a pillow. The hologram of Mr. Fluff re-appears.]''<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' "Nice disguise. Now you just have to get past your dog."<br>
''[While the dog continues snoring, Carlitos walks backwards to avoid the dog, but without noticing he steps on a squeaky elephant toy. It squeaks, causing him to panic and waking the dog up. Lalo looks around, and sees Carlitos pretending to be a stuffed toy. He shrugs his shoulders and continues sleeping. Carlitos tiptoes out the door. Meanwhile, the rest of his family are wearing special goggles and playing a video game, with one of them making engine revving noises. To the right, Carlitos walks towards the red door. He tries to reach the door handle but can't. He looks over to a pink handbag on the other side of Carlos' armchair and sees a crocodile toy attached to a pole. He has a thought bubble of a sad-looking him, and the door. It then becomes a happy-looking him holding the crocodile toy attached to the door handle. The thought bubble ends, and Carlitos starts crawling onto the rug, but stops up to where CJ is.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Mom, you're running me off the road--!"<br>
''[--Carlitos hides under the couch.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "You mean my road, mijo."<br>
''[He drops from the lamp and then sneaks behind Carlos' armchair. He grabs the handbag, which is revealed to be attached to the armchair's lever. He pulls the lever with the handbag. The armchair raises Carlos' legs.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Whoa! Must have hit the nitro."<br>
'''Frida:''' "Oh, no, you don't."<br>
''[While she makes more engine revving sounds, Carlitos crawls under the armchair and along the couch, but is kicked by Frida imitating a braking motion. Carlitos appears beside the red door. Suddenly, the hologram appears for a brief moment.]''<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' "Good thinking." ''[Carlitos uses his new toy to clip onto the door handle. It finally opens. He then opens the front door to the outside world and looks around. The hologram appears in an exhausted crawling motion.]'' "It's a long crawl to the arcade, you might need some wheels." ''[The hologram disappears. Carlitos looks around, and sees a boy wearing a helmet and holding a skateboard.]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "You coming down, Ronnie Anne? I finally perfected my move." ''[Hops on]'' "I call it the Laird-inator." ''[He grunts. Carlitos looks up, and sees a group of pigeons swarming down. He picks up the cracker box from the handbag and takes out some crackers.]'' "Come on, Laird. You got this! You just have to believe in yourself." ''[Carlitos tosses the crackers onto his helmet. He jumps, but is unknowingly carried by the group of pigeons.]'' "Wow, I'm getting some serious air!" ''[Carlitos notices the skateboard on its own. Mr Fluff appears and smiles at him.]''
----
''[Back at Carlitos' bedroom, Lalo continues snoring, but soon a piece of waddling sticks to his nose, causing him to sneeze and wake up. He looks at the cot, but discovers that the baby is missing. Panicking, he steps into the hallway and starts howling and barking. He opens up all the bedroom doors, with nobody to be found. He then opens the bathroom door, and discovers Vito on the toilet seat reading a newspaper.]''<br>
'''Vito:''' ''[Angrily]'' "Whoa! Don't people knock around here?"<br>
''[Lalo becomes embarrassed and backs off. He pops inside one of the rooms, looking for Carlitos. He lifts up one of the cushions, peeps under the table cloth and then looks out the window. He spots the baby riding a skateboard along the street at high speed. He yelps in despair. He escorts to the living room and barks to alert the Casagrandes. The family take their goggles off and pause the game.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Ssh, Lalo. Carlitos is sleeping."<br>
''[Lalo continues barking and points to the front door, trying to tell a message. He then sucks his thumb and toddles like a baby. He then swishes his tail and does walking motions.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Maybe Lalo wants us to take him for a walk."<br>
'''Carl, CJ and Frida:''' "Not it!"<br>
''[Lalo barks louder in desperation.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Not it." ''[Groans]'' "Why am I always it? Don't play without-- meeee!"<br>
''[--As soon as Carlos grabs hold of Lalo's leash, the dog sprints out the front door, taking him with it.]''
----
''[A Pedestrian walks along holding a tray with a pot of tea.]''<br>
'''Pedestrian:''' ''[On phone; British accent]'' "Oh, Mother, I promise I'll bring your teapot back in perfect condition.-- Whoa!"
''[--He jumps to dodge Carlitos' incoming skateboard, but loses the tray as well. He catches the cups with his hands and the phone with his foot. He bites the falling tray in the nick of time with the teapot landing on it. Meanwhile, Carlitos makes it to the arcade. Mr. Fluff reappears.]''<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' "You did it! Hurry inside before someone wins me."<br>''[Leaving the skateboard behind, he enters the arcade with the handbag. A group of cooing pigeons drop Laird off also at the arcade. Laird lands with two feet on his skateboard.]''<br>
'''Laird:''' "Yes, I did it! Anyone see that? No?" ''[The skateboard rolls him off-screen He screams and suddenly crashes into something. Inside the arcade, a miserable player walks off at the claw game. Carlitos peeps out from behind it. A hologram of Mr. Fluff appears inside the game.]''<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' "You made it, Carlitos!" ''[Carlitos laughs and climbs up the game's controls.]'' "The only way in is through the hatch up top." ''[The camera pans to the hatch. Carlitos tries to jump up to the roof, but cannot reach it. He tries to think of another way. He sees another customer playing the Wham-a-rat game. He gasps and notices the 'rats' pop out. He has another think. In a thought bubble, he can be seen jumping from a popping 'rat' towards the claw game's hatch. The bubble vanishes and he starts walking to the claw game. He hops in one of the rat holes.]''<br>
'''Game:''' "On your mark, get set, Wham!"<br>
''[A rat pops out, springing Carlitos up into the air. He shrieks happily as he makes his way to the top of the claw game, using the handbag as a parachute. He opens the hatch and greets his new friend.]''<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' "Best friends together at last." ''[They holds hands and laugh in celebration.]'' "Now we can have so much fun!" ''[However, Vito appears outside the claw game and grabs hold of Mr. Fluff with the claw.]'' "Whoa!" ''[Carlitos clings on to his legs]'' "Help me, Carlitos!"<br>
'''Vito:''' "Hey, I got one. Ha-ha!" ''[The claw drops both of them down the chute]'' "Who says these games were rigged?" ''[He collects the duo]'' "Whoa, whoa, two for one. Must be my lucky day." ''[The baby protests to him in gibberish.]'' "Huh, huh." ''[Shakes him a little]'' "They sure make teddy bears hi-tech these days. This one even talks." ''[He walks away from the arcade, carrying the duo while whistling a tune.]''
----
''[Meanwhile, Carlos is still holding on to Lalo's leash while being dragged about at high speed around the street.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Lalo, what's gotten into you? Heel!" ''[Lalo drags him into the park and pulls him through the bush. He continues screaming while the dog continues barking.]'' "Lalo, slow down!" ''[Soon, Lalo is seen sniffing on the ground, while at the same time, he crosses paths with Vito carrying Carlitos and Mr. Fluff.]''<br>
'''Vito:''' "Hey Carlos, I won two prizes in the claw machine."<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Beat while he is dragged and in a messy state.]'' Uh-huh. That's great, Vito.<br>
''[Vito then encounters Bruno, accompanied by two excited dogs.]''<br>
'''Vito:''' "Hey, Bruno. Thanks for watching the boys." ''[Pats them]'' "Big Tony, Little Sal, I got presents for ya. Enjoy your new chew toys.<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' ''[Shocked while Carlitos babbles]'' "Chew toys?!" ''[The dogs bark and want to play.]'' "Run quick before we're dog food!" ''[Carlitos runs away, carrying Mr. Fluff with him. The dogs prepare to take off and leap, however, they are still attached to their leashes and just flop onto the ground.]''<br>
'''Vito:''' "Sorry, boys, knock yourselves out." ''[He releases the leashes and the dogs set off. Carlitos and Mr. Fluff hides into the bushes. Soon, the dogs are standing in the middle of the park, arguing with one another. They then agree to go their separate ways and explore the park. As soon as they are out of Carlitos' sight, they breathe a sigh of relief.]''
----
''[Back at the arcade, Lalo drags a very exhausted Carlos into the arcade. Lalo searches all around it looking for Carlitos. They soon bump into a dancing game and start dancing to a beat, but then, Lalo returns to frantic dragging. Meanwhile, the claw machine grabs hold of a toy dinosaur, being controlled by Alexis.]''<br>
'''Alexis:''' ''[While Lalo continues barking.]'' "Come on! Come on!"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Lalo, where are you taking me?" ''[Lalo stops by the claw game, along with Carlos, who nudges the claw and causes it to drop the toy dinosaur and rendering Alexis out of luck.]''<br>
'''Alexis:''' "Oh, this just isn't my day." ''[He walks away, while Carlos slumps onto the ground and groans. Suddenly, he notices a familiar looking pink handbag.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Ooh? Is that our diaper bag?" ''[Takes it]'' "I must have left it behind and Lalo came here to find it." ''[Pats Lalo's head.]'' "Aww. What a good boy." ''[Lalo facepalms in annoyance.]''
----
''[Back at the park; At the bottom of the fountain, the dogs continue sniffing around in search of their 'chew toys'. The camera cuts to the fountain's top, revealing that Carlitos and Mr. Fluff are impersonating the fountain by gushing out water.]''<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' "That was close. Now's our chance."<br>
''[They jump off the fountain and tiptoe quietly across the park. They both gasp and find the exit, but as soon as they see a dog, they panic and hide behind the statue, sighing. Lalo barks in delight and runs towards the baby, carrying Carlos with him.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Oh, not this again." ''[Yelps]''<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' "Oh, no. If your dad finds us, he'll know you snuck out. This way." ''[They both gasp as two of Vito's's dogs spot them and start growling. Carlitos looks the other way, and sees Lalo trying to break free of Carlos' grip. A terrified Carlitos soon spots Alexis sat alone next to a tree, and talks to Mr. Fluff in gibberish.]''<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' "You want to give me to Alexis? But I thought ''we'' were going to be best friends." ''[Carlitos declines and speaks in more gibberish.]'' "You're trying to save me?" ''[Carlitos nods his head; touched]'' "Aww. You really are a good friend." ''[Carlitos tears up and hugs Mr. Fluff, until a moment later, he tosses the blue hologram towards Alexis; Waving in mid-air]'' "I'll never forget you, Carlitos!" ''[Carlitos babbles sadly as he loses his friend, who lands next to Alexis, making him curious.]''<br>
'''Alexis:''' "Whoa, where did you come from, Pinguino?"<br>
''[Carries the penguin and takes a walk. Suddenly, Big Tony and Little Sal charge at Carlitos, but the baby climbs up to the top of the statue, causing the dogs to perch up and continue barking. Suddenly, Sergio and Sancho arrive from the tree and fly towards him.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Carlitos." ''[Squawks]'' "What's with the getup?" ''[Carlitos speaks gibberish and points down to the two angry dogs at the bottom of the statue; Sergio Squawks]'' "You're going to be dog food?" ''[Carlitos speaks more gibberish and points behind himself.]''
"Or in trouble for sneaking out?" ''[Squawks]'' "You owe me one. Come on, Sancho!" ''[Meanwhile, Lalo breaks free of Carlos' grip and jumps up to try and catch Carlitos. Sergio and Sancho take the baby away just in time as Lalo clings on to the statue. However, it tips over, scaring the two other dogs away as it falls down. The two birds escort Carlitos to safety, while Lalo gets up and takes Carlos for a ride out of the park. At his bedroom, the birds drop him back into his cot. He sends his thanks by tossing a cracker to both birds to eat.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Pleasure doing business." <br>
''[He and Sancho leave the room, while Lalo drags Carlos up the stairs. The baby takes his bear suit off while Lalo bangs opens his bedroom door, and find Carlitos. Carlos soon lands with a thud, while Lalo continues barking at the baby.]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Oh. You've been acting strange all day."<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Arriving; To Carlos]'' "And look, you woke up Carlitos." ''[Holds the baby.]'' "Aww, how's mi bebe? Feeling better?" ''[Carlitos gibbers in a relaxed tone. Lalo facepalms and faints, while the other two boys arrive.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hey, Carlitos, you have a visitor."<br>
''[The family make their way to the living room, where Alexis is standing waiting.]''<br>
'''Alexis:''' "Hey, Carlitos. I saw you were sad that you didn't get a stuffed animal, so I spent all day trying to win you one. Man, those claw games are rigged. Luckily, I found this one at the park." ''[Shows a proper Mr. Fluff]'' "It's almost like it found me."<br>
''[Carlitos gasps and yells happily.]''<br>
'''Mr. Fluff:''' "Carlitos!"<br>
''[In slow motion, we see a dream of the duo coming together. Carlitos hugs the toy penguin, while Lalo is seen chewing on the now destroyed teddy bear. He points at Carlitos, and then himself.]'' <br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Snatches the teddy back]'' "Lalo, did you do this? Bad dog!"<br>
''[Lalo barks in confusion at the viewers. The episode ends.]''
