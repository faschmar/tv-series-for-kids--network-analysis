''[The Loud House. Lynn is in her room, playing with her soccer ball. Lincoln pops in.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Hey, Lynn!" ''[Lynn turns to Lincoln, and she kicks her soccer ball at him, sending him flying.]'' "Oof!" ''[Lincoln falls to the floor.]''<br />
'''Lynn:''' "Oh, sorry, bro!"<br />
''[Lincoln gets up.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' ''[with a hurt voice]'' "I'm okay." ''[Lincoln gets back up]'' "Can I borrow your sleeping bag? Lana's snake gave birth in mine."<br />
''[Shows that Lana's snake did give birth in Lincoln's sleeping bag.]''<br />
'''Lynn:''' ''[cringes in disgust]'' "Ugh. Gross. Eh, no prob." ''[She pulls it out from under the bed.]'' "All yours!" ''[Lynn plops her stinky sleeping bag on the floor; Lincoln cringes in disgust.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Ugh... Maybe I'll just sleep on the floor..." ''[Lincoln smiles again]'' "Tomorrow is the Fifth Grade trip to Big Bear Dunes National Park!"<br />
'''Lynn:''' "Ah, yes, Michigan's Gold Coast: the most baller of all the coasts."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "I can't wait! It's the last field trip of Elementary School, and my friends and I are really gonna go out with a bang!" ''[Lincoln smells Lynn's sleeping bag again, and pinches his nose in disgust]'' "Wha, wow... Can you move that sleeping bag?"<br />
''[Lincoln nudges the sleeping bag with his foot towards Lynn; she jumps over it and kicks it back under her bed.]''<br />
'''Lynn:''' "Oh-ho, I remember that trip." ''[She goes over to her nearby side-table and takes out a picture taken during that trip.]'' "So many fond memories..."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Who's that girl you're bench-pressing?"<br />
''[We see the picture; Lynn is bench-pressing a girl.]''<br>
'''Lynn:''' "My bunkmate, Sherry...? No, no, no, Shirley? Wait, Toni maybe? Yeah, I can't remember the names of people I'm not friends with anymore. We were close in fifth grade, but once you get to middle school, everything changes, even your friend group." ''[She pokes Lincoln on the nose]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Pfft... That won't happen to me and ''my'' friends. We're like siblings! We're gonna be close forever!"<br />
'''Lynn:''' "That's ''if'' you make it out alive." ''[Lynn gives Lincoln her Lacrosse stick]'' "Better take this for the bears."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' ''[scared]'' "Bears?"
----
''[The school bus drives by the signage for Sleeping Bear Dunes; Lincoln and his classmates have arrived at the park. Lincoln is the first to exit the bus. His pupils dilate in awe by the park's beauty.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Wow..."<br />
''[The camera cuts and pans to a view of the park and the surrounding beach.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "It's so beautiful! And it's so peaceful."<br />
''[The other students, amongst them his friend group, exit the bus altogether, running over and trampling Lincoln. He is left as a heap on the sandy ground. Principal Huggins exits the bus with his bag of belongings, passing Cheryl, who is holding a clipboard.]''<br />
'''Cheryl:''' "Okay, y'all little jitterbugs, your cabin assignments are goin' up on the activity board."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Huh?" <br>
''[Lincoln is trampled again by the other students. Clyde is the last to exit the bus, seeing the trampled Lincoln. He helps Lincoln up on his feet.]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "Come on, buddy."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Groans in pain]'' "Did Cheryl say cabin assignments?"<br />
''[Clyde nods his head.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "I thought ''we'' get to pick who we bunk with!" ''[Lincoln runs over to the nearby board to see who he's bunking with.]'' "Let's see who I'm bunking with." ''[Lincoln looks at the list of bunkmates]'' "Mmm... ''Principal Huggins?''"''[Dreading]'' "You gotta be kidding me!"<br />
''[Lincoln looks at his friends, and he sees Liam and Zach spraying Clyde with some kind of spray, while Stella and Rusty watch.]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "Thanks, guys. Let's do another coat in an hour."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' ''[walks over]'' "Okay, let's not panic over the assigned bunk sitch. I'll work some of my Loud Magic, and we'll all be bunking together in no time."<br />
'''Liam:''' "Actually, I'm happy as a skeeter in a sauna to bunk with Trent! He snuck in a whole mess of juice boxes with him.<br />
''[Whip right; Trent opens the left side of his coat, revealing that he has snuck in nine boxes of juice.]''<br>
'''Trent:''' "''Shh!''"<br />
'''Lincoln & Zach:''' ''[starry-eyed]'' "Oooh!"<br />
'''Zach:''' "I'm rooming with Hassan! He takes security as seriously as I do." ''[Hassan wheels in.]'' "Check out what he brought!" ''[A robot vaccum-looking device rolls in.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "A vacuum?"<br />
'''Hassan's robot:''' "Threat detected."<br />
''[The robot shocks Lincoln.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Ahh!"<br />
'''Zach:''' "No, it's the latest in-home security technology."<br />
'''Clyde:''' "I'm with Richie, but I'm actually OK with it! He brought in an air purifier, and you know how I am with pollen. Sorry, buddy!"<br />
'''Stella:''' "And I'm in the girls' bunk with Girl Jordan."<br />
''[Nearby, Rusty is holding a box full of stuff.]''<br />
'''Rusty:''' "Hey, look what Lance and me found in our bunk! Someone left a crate full of awesome random stuff!" ''[Lance puts a hat on Rusty's head]'' "Huh? Check out this hat! Score!"<br />
''[The others exclaim in surprise, and run to him; the only one who doesn't is Lincoln.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Great. So I'm not rooming with any of my friends."<br />
''[Flashback to his earlier talk with Lynn.]''<br />
'''Lynn Jr.:''' "But once you get to Middle School, everything changes. ''Even'' your friend group."<br />
''[End of flashback.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Nah, that wouldn't happen to us."<br />
'''Cheryl:''' "Chop chop! Y'all need to meet up at your first activity station in ten minutes."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Sweet. At least we all signed up to go Sand Boogey Boarding together."<br />
''[Rusty runs by Lincoln in a panic; the hat that Lance gave to Rusty was actually a racoon, and it's mad at Rusty.]''<br />
'''Rusty:''' "Yikes! Not a hat! Ahh!"<br />
----
''[The flailing Rusty serves as the transition to the next scene. Lincoln arrives at the beach, which is the intended venue for Sand Boogey Boarding, and looks out to the distance. No one is there, not even his friends.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Where is everybody?" ''[Lincoln is sad.]'' "I'll just Boogey my own board..."<br />
''[Lincoln steps back, then Boogeys his own board. He is happy, for this brief moment, anyway; his board crashes into a random rock, and Lincoln is sent flying. He falls close to the water with a mouth full of sand, and barfs it out. Lincoln is now miffed.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Where could they be?!"<br />
''[Clyde and Richie are making cherry jam using their feet; Lincoln walks in.]<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Clyde? I thought we were all gonna go sand boogey boarding together."<br />
'''Clyde:''' "Well, yeah, but then Richie sold me on making cherry jam. It's a real hoot, if you can stand the pain of the cherry pits." ''[As he says that, Clyde does step on some cherry pits.]'' "Ow! Ow! You should taste some." ''[Clyde then puts a foot up near Lincoln's face.]'' "It's delicious." <br />
'''Lincoln:''' ''[With a disgusted look on his face]'' "Ugh! I'm not eating your toe jam."<br />
'''Clyde:''' "Come on." ''[Clyde then flicks his foot, sending some of the jam into Lincoln's face.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Licks the jam]'' "Actually, that's not bad."<br />
----
''[A bored Lincoln walks around the camp; an ATV zooms by and he gets splattered in the face with sand. The ATV stops, and two of the passengers raise their visors to reveal that Stella and Girl Jordan are on the ATV.]'' <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Stella? I thought we were all gonna go hang out!" <br />
'''Stella:''' "Well, we found out Cheryl used to drive in Daytona, so..." <br />
''[Cheryl lifts up her visor.]'' <br />
'''Cheryl:''' "Sorry about comin’ in hot, punkin'. There is somethin’ about an all terrain vehicle that makes ol’ Cheryl crave the need for speed! Wooh!" ''[revs the ATV]'' "LET'S RIDE! YEE-HAW!" ''[Cheryl drives off.]''<br />
----
''[Lincoln is on the dock and spots Liam and Trent canoeing with Huggins; Huggins is launched off the boat, and Liam and Trent are horrified. Lincoln sighs, then looks right to see Rusty and Lance making the former into a sand mermaid. However, their fun is cut short when a vicious turtle emerges from the sand and starts towards Rusty; Lance flees the scene, and Rusty screams. Lincoln cringes; the outcome, while not shown, sounds painful. Lincoln then runs off to a bush, where he sees Zach roasting marshmallows with Hassan, using the robot as the "fire". Lincoln sighs forlornly again, then looks to the activity list as Zach and Hassan blow their marshmallows. He seems to have an idea, but is interrupted by two short beeps; the robot has moved to his location.]'' <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Huh?" ''[screams]'' <br />
'''Hassan's robot:''' "Spy detected." <br />
''[The robot electrocutes Lincoln once again, dropping his face back into the bush.]'' <br />
----
''[Sunset. Lincoln rushes over to his friends. who are sitting by a fire and talking.]'' <br />
'''Liam:''' ''[laughing]'' "...oh, delicious."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Finally!" ''[feels the aftershock of Hassan's robot's electrocution]'' "We’ve been at the park a whole day and this is the first time we’ve all been together!" ''[he realizes someone isn't here with them]'' "...wait, where’s Rusty?" <br />
''[Rusty runs in, with a bandage on his nose.]'' <br />
'''Rusty:''' "I know I’m late. Let’s just say I had a run-in with a hungry turtle... Sorry, Lance!" <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "It’s okay! Just -" ''[realizes Rusty called him "''Lance''"]'' "...wait, did you call me... ''Lance?''" <br />
''[Rusty has taken his seat in between Stella and Liam.]''<br />
'''Rusty:''' "My bad, bro, must’ve forgotten your name for a second." <br />
''[Lincoln is now worried; we flashback to his talk with Lynn.]'' <br />
'''Lynn:''' "I can’t remember the names of people I’m not friends with anymore..." <br />
''[End flashback; Lincoln is now even more worried.]''<br />
----
''[Night has fallen. We see a silhouette of Lincoln walking over to Clyde’s room. Inside, Clyde is sleeping loudly. His peaceful sleep is interrupted by the shadow of Lincoln looming over him.]'' <br />
'''Clyde:''' "AH!" <br />
''[Clyde hits the shadow with a pillow. Clyde puts on his glasses, and notices it’s his friend Lincoln, who has landed in a heap.]'' <br />
'''Clyde:''' "''Lincoln?''" <br />
'''Lincoln:''' ''[On the floor with a hurt voice]'' "Hey, buddy..."  <br />
'''Clyde:''' "Shh. You'll wake up Richie!" ''[Clyde points to Richie sleeping with jars of jam in his hands; Lincoln gets on Clyde's bed and seats himself next to his best friend.]'' "What are you doing here? And sorry for the whack." <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Normally, I wouldn't ''dream'' of waking you, but it's an emergency." <br />
''[Clyde's face momentarily registers shock.]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "Are the cats missing?!" ''[Clyde gasps and ducks under cover.]'' "Did my dads sell the house without telling me?!" ''[gasps once again]'' "It's Nana Gayle, isn't it?!" <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Worse. We're losing our friends." ''[Clyde gasp]'' "Think about it: no one wanted to bunk together, we all did separate activities, Rusty ''forgot my name!''" ''[sighs]'' Lynn warned me about this. Once you hit Middle School, your friend group falls apart." <br />
'''Clyde:''' "This ''is'' bad news. But what can we do?" <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "I'm thinking a hike to the dunes tomorrow. We'll make some memories and bring the group back together."  <br />
'''Clyde:''' "But everyone has already signed up to do other activities." <br />
''[Hearing this sets Lincoln into plan-mode.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Not for long..."<br />
----
''[The two boys exit Clyde's room and stealthily head towards the activity board. Lincoln throws a marker to Clyde.]'' <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Clyde, you cross everybody off their activity list, and I'll sign 'em up for our hike. <br />
''[Clyde crosses their friends' names off their respective activity lists, and Lincoln puts up his list for their hike.]'' <br />
'''Lincoln:'''  ''[Fist bumps a hairy fist]'' "Job well done, buddy... Huh? Clyde, your knuckles are very hairy." <br />
''[Clyde's hand pops in from the left side of the screen. Tense music plays.]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "Um, Lincoln? That's not me..."<br>
''[The two look upwards. The thing Lincoln fistbumped is actually a bear, which roars at Lincoln and Clyde! The two boys hug each other and scream, then stops as Lincoln realizes something...]'' <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Wait. Lynn's lacrosse stick!" <br />
''[He takes it out and is about to do battle with the bear, until...]''<br />
'''Cheryl:''' ''[in the distance]'' "Go on! Get those bear buns out of here!" ''[The bear runs off. Cheryl appears in her pajamas, banging two frying pans. She points one of her pans at the two boys.]'' "What are y'all little hoot owls doing out of your bunks?" <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Just, uhh..." ''[Throws the lacrosse stick off-screen]'' "Looking for my lacrosse stick. Oh, it's, uh, it's, uh, over there.<br />
''[The boys run off.]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "And now, we can sleep in peace."<br />
'''Cheryl:''' ''[Unconvinced]'' "Mm-hmm." <br />
----
''[It is now morning; Lincoln packs his bag.]'' <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "All set, Clyde?" <br />
'''Clyde:''' "Packed and ready." ''[He puts his bag on; however, the bag is too heavy for him...]'' "Oh, ah, oh!" ''[...and he falls to the ground.]''<br />
''[Lincoln is about to tend to Clyde, but in comes Lincoln's friend group.]'' <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Oh, hey guys. I didn't know you signed up for this hike."<br />
'''Rusty:''' "I ''didn't'' sign up for this hike, and yet I'm here."<br />
'''Stella:''' "Same." <br />
'''Liam:''' "Me too." <br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Well, look on the bright side. Now we can all spend the afternoon together. Should we get going?" <br />
'''Clyde:''' ''[Still on the ground]'' "Whoo-hoo! Let's do this!" ''[Lincoln and the others leave him. He falls on his belly, struggling to get up.]'' "Uhh, uhh, oh! Little help?" <br />
----
''[All six members are seen walking in the dune hike; Everyone walks slowly because of the heat.]'' <br />
'''Liam:''' ''[Sweating]'' "I'm sweatier than a sow in labor."<br />
'''Zach:''' ''[Angrily]'' "Yeah. My fair skin isn't meant for this brutal sun!"<br />
'''Rusty:''' "I hate hiking!"<br />
''[Rusty stops, causing Stella to bump into him, which then causes Clyde to bump into her. Clyde is about to tip over once again...]'' <br />
'''Clyde:''' "Uh! Not again!" <br />
'''Lincoln:''' ''[catches Clyde from falling]'' "At least we're together, right?"<br />
''[They may be together, but the other four stare at Lincoln with tired looks. Stella removes the sand that was in her shoe.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Don't worry, guys!" ''[pointing to his right]'' "There should be a path this way that'll take us back to the bunks." ''[pointing to his left]'' "''...oooooor'' is it that way?"<br />
'''Stella:''' "You sure you know where we're going?"<br />
'''Clyde:''' "Yeah. Everything around here looks exactly the same."<br />
''[The "suspectful" music starts up.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Hmm... Now that you mention it, I'm not entirely sure WHERE we're are."<br />
'''Zach:''' "Okay, let's draw straws..." ''[takes out a pack of straws]'' "...in case we have to eat someone."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "No one is eating anyone!" ''[Normally]'' "We just have to work together to find a way back to camp. The good news is..."<br />
''[He suddenly engulfs them in a group hug.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "...we'll always remember this exact moment that bonded us forever. Should we take a picture?"<br />
''[The negative looks on his friends' faces suggest they DON'T want to take a picture.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Got it... Not the right time." ''[Back to planning]'' "Liam, I need you in charge of hydration."<br />
'''Liam:''' "Just call me the Juice Daddy." ''[presents two of the juice boxes]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Stella, I need you to look for familiar landmarks."<br />
''[Stella nods in agreement".]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Anything that'll lead us back to camp. Clyde, I need you to..." ''[He stops and notices Clyde on the ground again with the heavy bag.]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "Uh... ''uh...''"<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "...uh, we'll come back to you." ''[Back to planning]'' "Zach, you're in charge of collecting food."<br />
'''Zach:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "Wait, you're telling me Clyde doesn't have anything to eat in that ''ginormous'' backpack?"<br />
''[Clyde is still trying to get up, to no avail.]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "Just..." ''[straining]'' "...bugspray..." ''[Grunts]'' "sunscreen... Gah!" ''[He finally manages to sit up.]'' "...lip balm..."<br />
'''Zach:''' "Huh. What ''flavor'' lip balm?"<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Rusty, I need you to find a way to send out an SOS signal."<br />
'''Rusty:''' "Initiating hair-tenna protocol."<br />
''[He puts some tin-foil, which electrifies, on his hair. The friend group splits up, with three exceptions: Lincoln, Clyde and Liam, the latter packing his juice boxes. Clyde wobbles from his bag's weight once again.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Isn't this exciting, Clyde? We're gonna remember this forever!" ''[He takes Clyde aside.]'' "Look, bud, keep this between the two of us. We're not actually lost."<br />
'''Clyde:''' "We're ''not''?"<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "No! I just thought ''working'' together would bring us ''back'' together." ''[He takes out the map.]'' "Don't worry, I have the map."<br />
''[However, a gust of wind takes the map away, and it flies into the tallest point of the nearest tree. The two boys run to this tree...]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Don't worry, I'll just go... grab it."<br />
''[A bird caws and snatches the map with its beak.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Uh... okay, ''now'' you can worry. We're actually lost."<br />
'''Stella:''' ''[from off-screen]'' "What do you mean 'actually'?"<br />
''[The downtrodden Clyde and nervous Lincoln turn to Stella and the others, who all glare at them. Lincoln tries to act cool, as if he did not do anything the whole time.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "So I MAY have pretended that we were lost... because I may have been trying to bring us closer together. But now we may actually ''be'' lost..."<br />
'''The friend group except Clyde:''' "''What?!''"<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "I promise this wasn't part of the plan. Tell 'em, Clyde!"<br />
'''Stella:''' "''Clyde?!'' ''You'' were in on this?!"<br />
'''Clyde:''' "I didn't know he was gonna get us lost! I just helped him cross your names on the activity list!"<br />
'''Zach:''' "You crossed our names off the activity list?!"<br />
''[Liam - holding two pineapple juice boxes - starts to lose his temper. He then squeezes the boxes, splashing the juice in his face.]''<br />
'''Rusty:''' "VERY uncool, Lincoln."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Protesting]'' "I can explain!"<br />
'''Stella:''' "You've done enough. I'm getting out of here." ''[She starts to walk to screen right, away from the group, and a saddened Lincoln and Clyde.]'' "Anyone who wants to go back to the bunks? Follow me."<br />
'''Rusty:''' "My luscious locks say this way."<br />
''[Rusty walks to the lower right.]''<br />
'''Liam:''' "My Mee-Maw always says, 'If you're lost in the hot sauce, the North Star's your boss."<br />
'''Zach:''' "Uh, it's ''daytime'', dude."<br />
''[Liam storms off lower left.]''<br />
'''Liam:''' "Mee-Maw never lies!"<br />
''[Zach shrugs shoulders and leaves screen left, leaving Lincoln and Clyde.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Guys! Wait!"<br />
''[Clyde walks away too, following Zach.]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "I'm going this way. The pollen count... seems lower..."<br />
''[Lincoln is now left alone.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "We should stick together!" ''[Now desperate, he tries to call his friends...]'' "STELLA! COME BACK! Rusty?!"<br />
''[...but to no avail. He sits down with a saddened look.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Aww..."<br />
''[The caws of the bird who took the map earlier can be heard.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Huh?" ''[He notices the bird sitting in his vicinity, along with the map. He becomes excited.]'' "The map!"<br />
''[He sneaks up to the map, but just as he reaches arm distance, he falls into a quicksand trap and screams. The bird flies away with the map.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Dang it..."<br />
----
''[Clyde is walking away, when...]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "HELP! HEEEEEEEELP!!!"<br />
''[Lincoln's cry for help is heard by the other four friends.]''<br />
'''The Friend Group:''' "LINCOLN!"<br />
''[Back at the bottom of the pit, Lincoln scoops some sand into a small bag, which is his underwear.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Hopefully someone sees my distress signal..."<br />
''[He throws it upward, only to hit Clyde, sending him flying off-screen. Clyde, down on his bag once again, recognizes this bag and gasps.]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "I'd recognize this underwear anywhere!"<br />
''[Lincoln sees Clyde pop up!]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Clyde!"<br />
'''Clyde:''' "GUYS!" ''[signalling for the other friends]'' "He's over here!" ''[to Lincoln]'' "Hold tight, buddy."<br />
''[The others have returned to bail Lincoln out from this pit prison.]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "We'll get you out! INITIATE CHAIN FORMATION!"<br />
''[Stella connects her hand with Clyde, Zach connects his with Stella, Rusty connects with Liam and Liam with Rusty. The Chain Formation proves helpful, as Clyde is able to reach into the pit...]''<br />
'''Clyde:''' "I got 'em! Bring me up!"<br />
''[...then the Chain Formation pulls, sending Lincoln flying out of the pit and into the dunes.]''<br />
'''Liam:''' "You okay there, fella?"<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Better now that you guys are here. I'm sorry for scheming behind your backs. Lynn told me that when you go to Middle School, you lose all your friends. And I was afraid that was happening to us."<br />
'''Zach:''' "Pssh. No way."<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "But everyone was doing their own thing this weekend."<br />
'''Stella:''' "We were just trying new stuff. But that doesn't mean we won't be friends."<br />
'''Liam:''' "Sure thing! We'll always be tight as a gaggle o' geese."<br />
''[Lincoln is touched.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Thanks, guys. Now bring it in!"<br />
''[He runs in for a friend group hug.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Not to ruin the moment, but, uh, technically we're still lost."<br />
''[The others widen their eyes in realization.]''<br />
'''Rusty:''' "...huh?"<br />
''[This is until Cheryl drives in on her ATV, splattering the group with mud.]''<br />
'''Cheryl:''' "There, y'all, my li'l sand crabs! Hop on! I'll give y'all a lift back!"<br />
'''Stella:''' "But we can't all fit!"<br />
'''Clyde:''' ''[from off-screen]'' "I have the solution!" ''[Clyde pulls a rope on his backpack, and out comes a raft. The other friends gasp in joy! Soon afterward, the friend group, cheering, is riding the raft - pulled by Cheryl's ATV - back to the bunks.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "I'm so glad we worked things out, guys! Nothing can separate us now."<br />
''[The ride becomes bumpy, and Lincoln is flown off the raft. With the raft zooming off into the sunset, Lincoln frantically chases it.]''<br />
'''Lincoln:''' "Guys! Wait up!"
