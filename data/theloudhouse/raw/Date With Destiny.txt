{{Transcript}}
''[Breakfast time at the Casagrande's. Maria, Ronnie Anne, Carlos, Carl, Bobby and Hector are waiting at the table]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Breakfast time, mis amores." ''[Exits the kitchen carrying six plates of tamales]'' "Here, let me serve you."<br>
''[Suddenly, something occurs on TV]''<br>
'''Magical TV Voice:''' "Next up, tu destino."<br>
''[It's time for Ernesto Estrella, Rosa gasps]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Nevermind, serve yourselves." ''[Piles the plates on her esposo and goes to the couch]'' "Ernesto Estrella is on."<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' "Buenos dias, mis estrellitas." ''[Comes closer]'' "Today, I am talking about the water sign."<br>
''[A blue water triangle appears in Ernesto's hand]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Oh, Maria, that's you."<br>
''[Reaches over and picks up her confused hija in her seat with one arm and sets her down. Maria's tamale falls off her fork]''<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' "A lifetime of happiness is in sight if…<br>
''[Maria's hijos become intrigued]''<br>
'''Rosa, Bobby & Ronnie Anne:''' "If…"<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' "You're back with your ex by tonight. Es tu destino!"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Maria, you're getting back together with Arturo. I knew it."<br>
'''Maria:''' "Ugh, ay, Mama. You know I don't believe in any of that Ernesto stuff."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Yeah, me neither. But it's so weird because the other day he predicted." ''[Flashback to Carlos brushing his teeth that day]'' "I'd find treasure in the bathroom." ''[Carlos squeezes the toothpaste and cash comes flying out, Carlos doesn't complain. End of flashback. Carlos takes out some of that cash]'' "Check it out." ''[Smells it]'' "It smells like mint."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Money in the bathroom!?"<br>
''[Makes a mad dash for the bathroom. Meanwhile, Carl steal the wad of cash from his padre]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Pfft, I never believe any of that Ernesto stuff." ''[Remember something]'' "Well, except this one time when he predicted…" ''[Flashback to Carl innocently playing with his train in his room]'' "I'd get pooped on by a bird, at home!" ''[Outside on a telephone wire, Sancho is reading a newspaper and drops a bomb. It bounces off an awning, then off a sign, goes down an oddly-shaped rain gutter and flies into Carl's window. Carl turns and sees it. He dodges Sancho's poop and is relieved]''<br>
'''Flashback Sergio:''' ''[Enters. Squawks]'' "Bombs away!"<br>
''[Poops on Carl, laughs and flies off. Carl gasps and is revolted. End of flashback, Carl is actually wearing the same shirt, which still has the poop on it]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "I mean, how did he know?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Don't you have any other clean clothes?"<br>
'''Maria:''' "Well, Ernesto's prediction for me can't possibly come true. I won't even be seeing Arturo today. I'm helping Frida with an art project all day, and Arturo is flying off to a medical convention in an hour."<br>
''[Walks off]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Trust me, mis niños, Ernesto's predictions always come true."<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[To Ronnie Anne]'' "What if Ernesto is right?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Unconvinced]'' "Mom and Dad are not getting back together." ''[Starts to wonder]'' "Are they?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "If they did it would mean a lifetime of happiness for all of us."<br>
''[Fantasizes a family photoshoot. All of them are happy. End of fantasy]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Starting to believe]'' "I guess it's worth a shot. All we have to do is get them together by tonight and let the magic happen."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Pops up between them]'' "You know, your mom and dad had their first date at the pier, so maybe if they met there."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Giggles]'' "Good idea, Abuela." ''[To Bobby]'' "I'll pick Mom up from the gallery. You stop Dad from getting on that plane."<br>
''[The Santiago kids race off. An Ernesto apparition appears next to Rosa holding a bow and heart arrow]''<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' "Si, time to let love's arrow fly." ''[Attempts to fire the arrow, but it just drops and the bow snaps Ernesto's hand]'' "Ay! Mi mano!"
----
''[Later, Ronnie Anne arrives at Frida's studio, which has a large orange piñata statue with two party hats, and a very realistic looking mouth]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Doesn't see anyone]'' "Mom? Mom, are you here?"<br>
''[Suddenly, the statue's mouth moves, having heard the familiar voice]''<br>
'''Maria:''' "Ronnie Anne, is that you?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Mom, what happened to you?<br>
'''Maria:''' "Frida. When I agreed to do this life-sized mould for her art installation, I didn't expect to be in plaster for four hours."<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' ''[Appears next to Ronnie Anne; annoyed]'' "We don't have four hours. Destiny waits for no one. Andale muchacha!" ''[Disappears]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Maybe it's ready now. Let's check."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne tries to move the plaster, but it's rock-solid]''<br>
'''Maria:''' "Pull."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Here, let me help."<br>
'''Maria:''' "Other way." ''[Ronnie Anne wears out while hanging on Maria's arm, suddenly they both fall to the floor]'' "It's okay, mija. Maybe you could just grab me a snack."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Pulls her arm out]'' "A snack? Let's go have lunch. A little plaster won't stop us."
----
''[Meanwhile, Arturo is putting his suitcase in the trunk of a taxi, when his hijo arrives, screaming]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Bobby, what are you doing here? I'm just on my way to the airport."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "In a taxi?" ''[Takes the case out]'' "No, that's so impersonal. Let your son drive you."<br>
'''Arturo:''' "No, mijo. It's okay." ''[Tries to take his case back, but Bobby won't let go]'' "I don't want to be a bother."<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Pulls on the suitcase]'' "It's no bother. And these taxis charge an arm and a leg to get to the airport."<br>
''[The taxi driver clears his throat, becoming impatient. Bobby and Arturo continue battling over owning the suitcase]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "My company's paying for it." ''[They continue pulling. Suddenly, the case goes flying away from the taxi.]'' "Ugh, now I'm going to be late."''[Runs off]'' "Where did my suitcase go?"<br>
'''Driver:''' "I don't have time for this."<br>
''[The driver closes the taxi's trunk and takes off. Arturo returns holding his suitcase.]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Okay, you win. You can drive me."<br>
''[Dusts his suitcase off. Ernesto appears next to Bobby and they give each other a thumbs up]''
----
''[Meanwhile, Ronnie Anne is wheeling Maria - on her skateboard - into the subway station]''<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Believing what Ronnie Anne told her]'' "Wow, I can't believe you got us a reservation at Chez Lunch. It's the hottest spot in town."<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' ''[Appears next to Ronnie Anne]'' "Ah, yes. A reservation for a lifetime of happiness. Next stop, amor!"<br>
''[The train arrives; Ernesto vanishes.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Come on, Mom. This is our train."<br>
''[Wheels Maria to the door]''<br>
'''Maria:''' "Are you sure I'll fit?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I just have to turn you a little."<br>
''[She struggles, but manages to budge Maria on the train. She breathes a sigh of relief. The doors close and the train sets off]''
----
''[Meanwhile, the mercado van is driving along the road]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Points to his right]'' "Ah, the airport is coming up on the right."<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' ''[Appears on the body of the dashboard hula dancer]'' "But his date with destiny is to the ''left!''"<br>
''[Without a second thought, Bobby veers left. They hit a pothole in the road. They then scream as the van rolls through a barrier and down a flight of stairs. It lands on the pier]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Did you ever doubt we'd make it?" ''[Scoffs]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Confused]'' "Mijo, the airport is the place with the planes, not the boats."<br>
''[Gestures to said boats]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Acting like he didn't know what he was doing]'' "Oh, right. I always get those two mixed up."<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Groans]'' "I'm not going to make my flight. I'll have to call the airline to reschedule." ''[Leaves the van to do so]''<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' "Good work."<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Clenches fist]'' "Yes!"
----
''[The train lands at the station and Ronnie Anne wheels something out]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We made it, Mom." ''[Realizes her skateboard is full of piñatas]'' "Mom?" ''[Looks around and gasps, the lady who had the piñatas has Maria in her wagon]'' "Mom! I'm coming!"<br>
''[She starts towards her madre, but a mob of patrons blocks her path, they clear out and Ronnie Anne sees her madre being wheeled away. She looks back at the piñatas and gets an idea. She kicks the Piñatas off, grabs her board and gets skating. The piñatas are flying through the air and Ronnie Anne skates over a guy's foot]''<br>
'''Incidental:''' "Hey!"<br>
''[Looks at Ronnie Anne, upset. Ronnie Anne manages to get her madre back on the skateboard, just as the pinatas land in the lady's wagon]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Phew."<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Completely unaware, thought Ronnie Anne was with her the whole time]'' "And ''that's'' the story of how I became a nurse. You're such a good listener, Ronnie Anne."
----
''[Back on the pier, Arturo is on the phone]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Uh, yeah, yeah, I need to rebook. Can you tell me when the next available flight is?"<br>
''[Continues with his phone call, while Bobby makes a call of his own]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hello?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "We're here. Where are you?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We're right here."<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Thinks Ronnie Anne's talking about the restaurant]'' "Oh, good. My stomach was starting to rumble."<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Sees behind him]'' "Oh, hey!" ''[Hangs up as Ronnie Anne approaches him. Getting excited]'' "Get ready for the magic to happen."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Also excited]'' "Lifetime of happiness, here we come."<br>
''[They the hermanos don't see is a group of seagulls land on Maria]''<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Feels something]'' "Huh?" ''[She moves a little on Ronnie Anne's skateboard, which starts to move]'' "Uh, what's happening?"<br>
''[The skateboard rolls away, Bobby and Ronnie Anne are too distracted to notice]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Showing Ronnie Anne something on his phone]'' "And I thought this is how we could pose for the family photo. So, where's Mom?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Gestures to where she left Maria]'' "She's right here." ''[An outline of the piñata flashes on screen. Sees that their madre is gone]'' "Mom?"<br>
''[They look in the other direction and see their madre as she starts to roll down the pier]''<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Feeling the movement]'' "Are we back on the train?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Horrified]'' "Mom!"<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Realizes]'' "Wait. That Mom-shaped statue is Mom?" ''[Waving his arms in horror]'' "MOMMY!"<br>
''[Maria rolls past the stage at the bottom of the pier, where someone sees her and goes after her. Maria goes over the pier and splashes into the water. The character who was chasing after her dives in. ​​In the water, just as the air bubbles are rising to the surface, a hand grabs Maria, and out of the water, it is shown to be a muscular man and the man carries the unconscious Maria out of the water. Maria moans as she starts to wake up, and she sees the man, and she gasps in delight. But the muscular man is revealed to be T-Bone]''<br>
'''T-Bone:''' "Hey, it's okay. I've got you."<br>
'''Maria:''' "T-Bone, is that you?"<br>
'''T-Bone:''' "Whoa, Maria." ''[He puts Maria back down]'' "Oh, it's been a minute."<br>
''[Maria's hijos arrive and look over the pier and see what's going on]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Not about to have this]'' "Oh, no. We didn't do all this work just so another ex could swoop in and ruin everything."<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Angrily]'' "Yeah, let that T-Bone find his own lifetime of happiness."<br>
'''T-Bone:''' "Hey, would you like to have dinner with me tonight at our place?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Can't believe this]'' "They have a place?"<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Blushing]'' "You remember the pizza place? I'll meet you there tonight at seven. I better go freshen up."<br>
''[Goes to do so. Fantasy Ernesto appears - with hands on his head. This time, both hermanos see and hear him]''<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' "You better fix this, rapido, or you're gonna be stuck with this guy." ''[Disappears]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Formally]'' "We have to get rid of T-Bone and get Dad to the restaurant."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "I'll grab Dad, and meet you there."<br>
''[They get going]''
----
''[Seven o'clock at Amores Pizza, T-Bone gets a bouquet of flowers out of his bag]''<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Flattered]'' "T-Bone, you remembered that daisies are my favourite flowers." ''[Giggles]''<br>
'''Bobby & Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Watching from behind the adjacent table, squeezing eyes shut]'' "Ew."<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' "Oh, he's pulling out the big guns."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Dad's gonna be here any minute. It's time to get rid of this T-Bone-head." ''[Sinks down, and crawls to T-Bone's bag]'' "Let's see how smooth he is with garlic breath."<br>
''[Replaces T-Bone's breath mints with garlic mints. Almost on cue, T-Bone reaches down and tosses a few in his mouth]''<br>
'''T-Bone:''' ''[Not noticing the stink lines]'' "Ah." ''[Goes back to Maria]'' "I'm so glad we had that crazy run-in today. It's almost like it was destiny."<br>
'''Maria:''' "Yeah, truly." ''[Suddenly the daisies wilt from the smell and Maria almost chokes on it. Before she pukes, she picks up a menu to subtly use as a shield]'' "So, what do you want on your pizza?" ''[To herself]'' "Hopefully not garlic."<br>
'''T-Bone:''' "Ah, anything but pineapple. I have ananaphobia. You know, the fear of pineapples. I mean, they look like they have hair. They're pointy. They really freak me out, man."<br>
''[T-Bone shudders, and Bobby and Ronnie Anne look at each other]''<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' "We found a weakness! Go, go, go!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne moves out and whispers something to the waiter.]''
----
''[Later, Maria and T-Bone are gazing at each other, then the waiter comes in and serves a pineapple-based dish.]''<br>
'''Waiter:''' "Here you go, one extra-large pineapple pizza with extra pineapples and a pineapple stuffed crust."<br>
''[T-Bone is frightened by the sight of it. Suddenly the pizza grows a face]''<br>
'''Pineapple Monster:''' "Hello T-Bone. Remember me?"<br>
'''T-Bone:''' ''[Freaks out]'' "P-P-Pineapples?!" ''[T-Bone gets up, freaks out, and throws the pizza onto the floor which he then slips on. He gets up with pineapple in his hair, jogging in place]'' "Maria, I will call you for a redo of our date." ''[Takes a breath, and runs out screaming]''<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Groans]'' "Uh, why can't I ever find a nice, normal guy?"<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Offscreen, didn't expect to see her]'' "Maria?"<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Sees Arturo approaching her, also didn't expect to see him]'' "Arturo?"<br>
''[Their hijos come up from under the table their hiding behind with anticipation]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Wait for it, Ronnie Anne. The magic's finally going to happen!" ''[Takes out a tissue box]'' "You might need a tissue because I know I will." ''[Starts crying]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "I'm here to meet Ronnie Anne and Bobby. They didn't tell me you were coming."<br>
'''Maria:''' "Oh, no. I'm here on a date. Well, at least, I was."<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Sees the look on Maria's face]'' "Been there."<br>
'''Maria:''' "Oh, hey, while you're here, let me give you some dates for the kids' after-school activities. I think some of them have changed."<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Good idea."<br>
''[They start exchanging calendar dates]''<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Where's the magic? The fireworks? The love?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Starting to get rational]'' "Maybe we were just fooling ourselves with all that horoscope stuff."<br>
'''Bobby:''' ''[Not ready to give up]'' "No! Ernesto said it was gonna happen so it's gonna happen!" ''[Bobby moves in, grabs a handful of spaghetti off the waiters tray, lets out a cry and ties his padres together with it]'' "Destino!"<br>
'''Maria:''' "Bobby, what are you doing?"<br>
''[Suddenly, Arturo slips in some tomato sauce and the two go flying and crash into the waiter offscreen]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Mom, Dad, are you okay?"<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[To Bobby, aghast]'' "Mijo, what's gotten into you?"<br>
'''Bobby:''' "''We'' did all of this work to get you two here, so we can all have a lifetime of happiness. You're not leaving here until you get back together again, just like Ernesto said."<br>
'''Maria:''' "So ''that's'' what this is about."<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Who didn't see Ernesto Estrella]'' "Huh? Can someone tell me what's going on?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Sighs]'' "Ernesto Estrella predicted you guys would get back together tonight. Hearing it out loud now, it does kind of sound silly, huh?"<br>
''[Arturo and Maria look at each other]''<br>
'''Maria:''' "I don't think it was silly. I mean, we ''are'' together tonight."<br>
'''Arturo:''' "Just not romantically."<br>
'''Bobby:''' "Yeah, but... it's just one dumb night, not a lifetime."<br>
'''Maria:''' "But we'll be a ''family'' for a lifetime."<br>
''[They all hug]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' "And hey, what if we made it a regular thing? A family pizza night every month."<br>
''[Ernesto Estrella is watching from outside]''<br>
'''Ernesto Estrella:''' "And boom! A lifetime of happiness after all. Ernesto is the besto. Estrella out."<br>
''[Flies out. The cape covers the screen and leaves behind a black background with sparkly stars.]''
