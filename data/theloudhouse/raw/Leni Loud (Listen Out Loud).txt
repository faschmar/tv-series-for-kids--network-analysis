''[Leni is at the Royal Woods Mall. She's testing out the mic]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[to the listeners]'' "Hello? Hello? Helloooooo?" ''[to her brother]'' "Lincoln, how do you turn this thing on?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Leni, it ''is'' on. That's what that red light is."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[cheerfully]'' "Oh, great! How do I look?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Leni, it's a podcast. No one can see you."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Then why did I spend $70 on a new outfit? Oh well, never mind." ''[to the listeners]'' "Hey, guys! This is Leni Loud, and it's my turn to host the Listen Out Loud podcast. Today, I'm gonna give you a tour of my favorite place in the world- The Royal Woods Mall!" ''[a celebratory jingle plays with firework sound effects]'' "Those aren't real fireworks, they're sound effects, brought to you by my brother Lincoln, who's my little helper on this podcast."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "More of a producer, really."<br>
'''Leni:''' "So this mall is basically where I spend, like, 90% of my life. I buy all my clothes here, all my presents, all my scented candles, which I give as presents. So let's just walk around and I'll tell you about all the amazing stuff at the Royal Woods Mall." ''[the celebratory sound effect plays again]'' "So we'll start at the nail salon." ''[a bell rings as they enter]'' "I once saw Patchy Drizzle getting a mani-pedi in here. He's our local weatherman and a huge celebrity. But real talk? His toenails were super flakey. Probably because he's always wearing mandals. Wait, what was I talking about?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "The nail salon."<br>
'''Leni:''' "I don't think anyone wants to hear about that, Lincoln. Let's move on." ''[they continue their tour]'' "This is my favorite shoe store my friends and I buy tons of shoes here they're usually marked down fifty percent unless they have a purple sticker which means they're half off."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Wait. What's the difference?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Oh. There's the owner. Hey, Mr. Sherman."<br>
'''Mr. Sherman:''' "Hello, Leni. We just got a shipment of those floral clogs you like. I'll save you a pair."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Great. Daffodil, please." ''[they move on]'' "So, this is the pet store this is where my family buys toys and food for Lana."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "And our pets."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Oh, yeah, them too."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Aw, look at that cute puppy in the window."<br>
'''Leni:''' "I'm sorry, Lincoln, I can't. If I make eye contact, I'll want to adopt him. Let's keep moving." ''[they move on. Suddenly there's the sound of police chirps]'' "Oh, hey Ernie!"<br>
'''Ernie:''' "Hiya, Leni!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Everyone, this is Ernie, one of the fantastic mall cops here at Royal Woods Mall."<br>
''[Lincoln plays the fireworks again]''<br>
'''Ernie:''' "What was that?! A firecracker?" ''[into his radio]'' "I'm gonna need back up!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "No, sir, it's okay those were just my incredibly real sound effects. Lincoln Loud, producer."<br>
'''Ernie:''' "Oh, cancel that backup."<br>
'''Leni:''' "We'll see you later Ernie good luck with that blind date on Friday."<br>
'''Ernie:''' ''[takes off]'' "Thanks, kid! I'm gonna wear that sweater you picked out for me!"<br>
''[leaves. Leni and Lincoln continue the tour]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Now this is the fro-yo place. My friends and I hang out here a lot. Their yogurt is delicious and they have amazing toppings. My friend Erica is obsessed with a guy who works the cash register. Before that, she was obsessed with the mall train conductor. And before that, it was a guy who turned out to be a mannequin… Wait what was I talking about?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "The fro-yo store. Oh. Speaking of which, maybe we should stop in there and grab a snack. I could use a little break."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Lincoln, we just started. We have a lot of ground to cover." ''[Lincoln sighs. They continue]'' "Here's the Music Store perfect for Luna's presents." ''[they continue]'' "This is the princess store, great for Lola presents…" ''[they continue]'' "Here's the health food store, great for buying Lori her local bean chips."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "And here's the arcade, which I'm sure the listeners will want to know more about. Should we stop in and try out a few games?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Not now, Lincoln. We're about to go to the most important stop on our tour."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "But as your producer, I think…"<br>
'''Leni:''' "So this is our big department store. It's what we mall experts call an anchor store. But, I've never seen an anchor in here. Let's go in, shall we?" ''[they enter]'' "Chet's on piano today! Hi, Chet!"<br>
'''Chet:''' "There she is! This one goes out to you, Leni."<br>
''[plays some mood music]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Don't you just feel better about life the moment you walk in here?" ''[sighs]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[record needle scratch]'' "I'd feel better if I were blasting aliens with a laser cannon."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Lincoln, you're killing the mood." ''[they continue]'' "This is the makeup section. They have lots of product testers, which come in really handy if you have an emergency. Like if one eye looks bigger than the other."<br>
'''Morris:''' ''[gasps]'' "Hello, Leni Loud!"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[squeals]'' "Morris!"<br>
'''Morris:''' "You look fabulous, as always."<br>
'''Leni:''' "So do you! Everyone, this is my friend Morris. He's a salesperson and the store's best stylist."<br>
'''Morris:''' "'Everyone'? Are we on TV? What's happening? Should I call my agent?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "No, we're doing a live podcast! This is my brother-"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Lincoln Loud, producer."<br>
'''Morris:''' "Well. hello Lincoln. So what's our podcast about?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "I'm giving the listeners a tour of the Royal Woods Mall."<br>
''[Lincoln plays the fireworks again]''<br>
'''Morris:''' "Ooh, a high-tech production. Well, listeners you couldn't have a better tour guide. This girl is a fashion powerhouse."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Oh please Morris you're the fashion genius."<br>
'''Morris:''' "Well, I don't know about genius… Okay genius, why not? Wait, but speaking of fashion… Lincoln we need to talk. Please pick up the blue courtesy phone."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Excuse me?"<br>
'''Morris:''' "You're adorable, but this look you're rocking: the orange polo, the jeans, the sneakers. The 1950's just called, you're late for your Salisbury steak dinner."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "I have no idea what you just said."<br>
'''Morris:''' "Sweetie, we need to do you."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "What? No, I'm fine."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Lincoln, getting Morris to give you a makeover is, like, an unbelievable honor."<br>
'''Morris:''' "Our young gent's section is right over there"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "But…"<br>
'''Morris:''' "What about this cute top?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Top? I usually wear shirts."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Let's just put it on you."<br>
''[they put it on]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Watch the mic!"<br>
'''Morris:''' "It's a start. How about a nice unstructured blazer over that?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Uh…"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Just try it, Lincoln."<br>
''[Lincoln sighs and puts it on]''<br>
'''Morris:''' "Hmm, what's missing?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[deadpan]'' "My dignity?"<br>
'''Morris:''' "A hat! A straw porkpie would be cute." ''[gets one]'' "There. And last but not least we need a new scent for you."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "What's wrong with my old scent?"<br>
'''Morris:''' "Hmm. That was more of a smell. Try this."<br>
''[sprays Lincoln]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Lincoln you look amazing."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "I'm just glad this is a podcast so no one can see me."<br>
'''Todd:''' "Yo, Loud!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Oh no. Hey, Todd, hey, Richie."<br>
'''Todd:''' "Didn't know you were such a fashion plate, Loud."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "I'm not. This is just-"<br>
'''Todd:''' "Hilarious? Couldn't agree more. Let me just get a few pics so I can share with everyone at school." ''[takes photos]'' "Later, handsome. Oh, also, love the new smell."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "It's called a scent!" ''[the bullies leave, laughing]'' "Okay, well my life is over."<br>
'''Morris:''' "Oh, they're just jealous of your sizzling new look."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Trust me they're not. Here Morris, please take your clothes back before anyone else I know sees me. Leni, can we just go home now?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "I'm sorry, Lincoln. I didn't mean to embarrass you. We can go." ''[gets an idea]'' "After we do one more thing, come on."<br>
''[they go somewhere]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[gasps]'' "We're going to the fro-yo place?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Yep, my treat."<br>
'''Cashier:''' "All right so the total for the two fro-yos comes to $8.50."<br>
''[The two Louds eat the fro-yos]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Thanks, Leni this is delicious. Though, I got so excited about the toppings I forgot to put yogurt in here."<br>
'''Leni:''' "You're welcome, and now we're stopping in here."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "The arcade?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Yep, one hour of games on me. It's to thank you for being my helper- I mean, producer- and for being such a good sport."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Yes! You're the best, Leni."<br>
'''Leni:''' "I don't know any other Lenis. Well, podcast listeners, thanks for tuning in. I'm your host, Leni Loud, and- oh no, I just made eye contact with a puppy. Gotta go!"
