''[In the Casagrandes' living room, Frida is crying her eyes out. Carlitos and a rather gussied up Sergio are sitting with her, wearing umbrella hats to block Frida's tears, and there's a pile of tissues on the floor. Ronnie Anne walks up to them.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hey, TÃ­a Frida, are you okay?"<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Stops crying]'' "I'm fine, I just get emotional whenever I watch Camila."<br>
''[On the show]''<br>
'''Distraught Wife:''' "We used to be in love, but now all we do is bicker."<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Like me and Priscilla! She says I have a shopping addiction."<br>
'''Camila:''' ''[Holds the wife's hands]'' "Aye, mis corazones. When we come back, it's makeup or breakup time."<br>
'''Audience:''' "Break up! Break up! Break up!"<br>
''[A message comes up on the screen.]''<br>
'''Camila:''' "Is your relationship in trouble?" ''[Gasps]'' "Look for these warning signs; excessive bickering."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Hector! Why are you eating again? We're about to have dinner."<br>
'''Hector:''' "This is an appetizer."<br>
'''Camila:''' "Passive-aggressive vacuuming."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Still miffed with Hector.]'' "Aye! You're making a mess."<br>
''[Gets her vacuum out and cleans Hector's crumbs, then she vacuums off Hector's shoes, and clothes. Ronnie Anne gets nervous. Next, Rosa's vacuum and Hector's mouth are both trying to suck in Hector's tamale. The vacuum wins.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Awe."<br>
'''Camila:''' "And the last most important sign, Sleeping on the couch."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Everyone off the couch, I have to make the bed for Hector."<br>
'''Camila:''' "If this sounds familiar don't lose hope, call the Camila helpline now."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne starts to worry.]''
----
''[The next day, Ronnie Anne is with her uninterested primos in the secret room.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Guys, we have a situation. I think Abuelo and Abuela's relationship is in trouble."<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Pshh, please."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Yeah, they've been married for like a billion years."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "But all the warning signs are there. I don't wanna take any chances, there's gotta be something we can do to rekindle their romance."<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[Gasps]'' "Ooh, why don't we just get them to do sweet, thoughtful things for each other."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Perfect."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Offscreen]'' "One-thousand-three, one-thousand-four." ''[Revealed to be squatting Carlitos, using him like a weight.]'' "Camila says couples that stay fit, stay together." ''[Carlitos becomes too heavy for Sergio.]'' "Gah! Spot, spot."
----
''[Later, Hector is leaving the mercado.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Roberto, I'm off to run errands, then my four p.m. nap."<br>
''[Hector walks up to Carlota and Ronnie Anne.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "While you're out, maybe you can pick up some flowers for Abuela."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Hombre, even if I did have time, why should I pay top dollar for something that'll wilt and die?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "So your marriage doesn't wilt and-"<br>
''[Carlota covers Ronnie Anne's mouth.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Good point, Abuelo, maybe you have time to write her a song."<br>
'''Hector:''' "I already wrote her one." ''[Starts singing on his way out.]'' "ðŸŽµ ''Oh mi amor! Please stop your nagging.'' ðŸŽµ"<br>
''[Giggles as he walks out. And the girls look at each other.]''
----
''[Next, Rosa walks out of the apartment with her toolbox. She is about to go when the girls cut her off.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hi Abuela."<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Abuelo was just bragging about your mole." ''[To Ronnie Anne]'' "Right?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Totally. Hey, maybe you could cook it for him tonight."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Mole takes hours, and I have to finish unclogging the drain in apartment 4D. Those girls have so much hair. I'll see you kids' when I get back." ''[Leaves]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "This isn't working, they're too busy for romantic gestures."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Then we're going to have to unclog their schedules."
----
''[Later, Camila is back on, the audience chanting for the couple to break up. Hector and Rosa are at the table, Rosa sorting the laundry, and Hector fixing a hotdog rotisserie. Rosa Sniffs a dirty shirt and retches when Ronnie Anne, CJ, and Carl come up.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hey Abuela, take a break, we can do your chores." ''[Carlota takes the rotisserie.]'' "We'll take care of that for you too Abuelo."<br>
'''Hector and Rosa:''' ''[Pleased]'' "Really?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Escorts them to the door.]'' "Now you kids go do something fun, or romantic, like a picnic in the park, or a carriage ride." ''[Opens the door]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Gracias Mija. Hector, I'll be at the hardware store."<br>
'''Hector:''' "AdiÃ³s, I'm gonna sit in the massage chair at the mall."<br>
''[They leave, but get jammed in the door, fighting each other to get out which they eventually do.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Okay, what just happened?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "They'll never rekindle their romance if they don't spend time together."<br>
''[Thinks next to the TV.]''<br>
'''Camila:''' "Do you and your loved one never spend time together? Call Camila now."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Gasps]'' "I've got it. Why don't we set them up on a surprise date?"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Lame! I have a better idea, I'll dress up as an evil ninja and pretend to rob the mercado." ''[Reaches into the laundry basket and puts a pair of briefs over his face like a mask.]'' "Then Abuelo will have to save Abuela and she'll be allâ€¦ "''Oh Hector so brave.''" ''[Makes kissy noises.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Okay, that's a terrible idea."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "You do know that's the ''dirty'' laundry, right?"<br>
''[Carl realizes that he's wearing someone's dirty underwear on his face.]''
----
''[Later, Rosa is making taquitos.]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Abuela, someone has a crush on you." ''[Walks up with Ronnie Anne and Carlota, holding roses and a card.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ooh, que lindas flores." ''[Reads the card]'' "''Please join me for a fancy dinner at 6 pm in the secret room. Love Hector''" ''[On the other side of the card is Hector's face pasted onto a male model's body.]'' "Que romÃ¡ntico, I better get ready, help yourselves to dinner." ''[Goes off]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Quick! Pack up the food and get down there. Move! Move! Move!" ''[Down in the mercado, Hector is mopping the floor, when Ronnie Anne, CJ and Carlota run in.]'' "Hey Abuelo." ''[The three of them slip on the mop water and fall.]'' "We can take care of that, you have to get ready."<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Yeah, Abuela spent all day making you a romantic dinner."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Really? It's about time."<br>
'''Carlota:''' "We just need to spiff you up a bit."<br>
''[Goes to get some stuff off the shelves; a comb, some hair gel, some flea powder. One pink dust cloud later and Hector is looking good.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "I'm coming mi corazon de melÃ³n."<br>
''[Heads off, but slips in the water. In the secret room, Ronnie Anne and Carlota set out the food and put up a romantic backdrop.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "This place looks amazing Carlota."<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Runs in]'' "They're coming! They're coming! We need to hide."<br>
''[They look around, there are three empty boxes right next to them so they jump in. Rosa walks in all dressed up, followed by Hector.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Hola, seÃ±orita bonita."<br>
''[Spins and dips her.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Que guapo."<br>
''[Hector takes her to her chair and sits in his. He smells the food so hard two taquitos get stuck in his nostrils.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Smells delicioso."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Si, almost as good as mine."<br>
'''Hector:''' "It should, you cooked it."<br>
''[Rosa is confused by this. Ronnie Anne and CJ get nervous, so CJ turns on some music.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Awe, it's the song from our wedding."<br>
''[They dance together.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "It takes me back, you haven't aged a day mi flora."<br>
''[Close up, Rosa is actually rather aged. The lovely couple proceeds to laugh together.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "Awe."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "It's working."<br>
'''Hector:''' "A toast, to the love of my life and the best years-"<br>
''[Suddenly there's a snicker at the entrance.]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Freeze! This is a robbery!" ''[Carl is still going with his ninja plan.]'' "Give me all your dinero and nobody gets karate-chopped!"<br>
''[Carl jumps up on the table and some taquitos fly at the made over Rosa. But Hector dives and catches them in his mouth before they ruin her dress and lays down on the floor.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Hector!" ''[She looks angrily at the ninja, Carl squints, Rosa squints back. She takes off her shoe and throws it like a star. Carl is scared now, he jumps out of the way, but the shoe circles back around and chases Carl out of the secret room.]'' "That's right! Keep running!" ''[Carl runs out, and Rosa listens as the shoe hits him. She puts her hand out and catches the shoe as it returns and puts it back on. To Hector.]'' "Thanks for saving me, mi amor."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Saving you? I was making sure the food was okay." ''[Rosa is offended and she puts Hector down and leaves. Hector gets up.]'' "Rosa, come on." ''[Chases after her.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Infuriated]'' "I'm gonna kick Carl's butt! He ruined our plan."<br>
'''Carlota:''' "What now? We tried everything."<br>
'''CJ:''' "It's hopeless."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne thinks, visions Camila circling around her head.]''<br>
'''Camile:''' "Don't lose hope. Call now. Aye! What are you doing? Call already!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Wait. Why didn't I think of this before? There's one person who can save Abuelo and Abuela's marriageâ€¦ Camila!"
----
''[At the television studio, Carlota, CJ, and Ronnie Anne are escorting Hector and Rosa down the hall.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I can't wait to see your school play, Mija."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Me too. But, why isn't it at your school?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, uh, they wanted to mix it up."<br>
'''Assistant:''' ''[Comes up to Hector and Rosa.]'' "Mr. and Mrs. Casagrande to makeup." ''[Takes them there. To the makeup artist, regarding Hector's bald head.]'' "Can we do something about this glare? And let's put Mama Grande's face on."<br>
''[The makeup artist puts a giant powder puff on Hector and make's Rosa look cuter.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Confused]'' "Aye, what happening?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Ohâ€¦ Uhâ€¦ The play involves audience participation."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Pops out of Rosa's purse. Squawks.]'' "Good thing I'm camera ready."<br>
''[Flexes and kisses his muscles. Ronnie Anne grabs him.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Sergio! What are you doing here?!"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Need to meet Camila, hear she helps birds."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "You're gonna blow our cover! Priscilla will have to wait." ''[Stuffs Sergio into her hoodie. She hears the music.]'' "Sounds like the play's starting. Time to go to your seats." ''[Takes Hector and Rosa.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "This song sounds familiar."<br>
''[At the stage, the audience is cheering, Rosa and Hector are confused to be coming out onto it.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Isn't this the stage?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Your seats are on the stage. Best seats in the house."<br>
''[Suddenly the lights dim. Out on stage, the lights dance, two fire pillars erupt and from a trapdoor in the floor, Camila emerges.]''<br>
'''Camila:''' "Hola mis corazones!" ''[The audience cheers]'' "We're about to meet a couple struggling to save their decades-old marriage." ''[Hector and Rosa come out, still having no idea what's going on.]'' "Please welcome, the Casagrandes, a couple whose marriage is on the rocks."<br>
''[Back at the apartment, Frida, Carlitos and Lalo are watching the show.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Spits out her corn on Lalo, horrified to see her own familia on the show.]'' "Oh, NOOOOO!" "[Lalo licks up and eats the corn.]"<br>
''[Frida cries so hard her hijo and dog float away.]''<br>
'''Camila:''' "So tell me, when did it all go wrong?"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Is this the play? Who is nosy metiche?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "She's Camila. Do you live under a rock?"<br>
'''Camila:''' "Rosa, I'm hearing anger from you. Is that right?"<br>
''[The audience gasps.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Raises her voice]'' "That's just my voice."<br>
'''Camila:''' "Is it? Or are you upset at Hector, for letting himself go? Spending all day in his underwear."<br>
''[The audience gasps again. Offstage.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[To Ronnie Anne]'' "You told her that?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I just filled out the questionnaire they sent."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Those were shorts. That she shrunk!"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "They didn't shrink. You got bigger!" ''[The audience gasps]'' "He hides snacks in his shoes! I check."<br>
'''Hector:''' "I do not!"<br>
''[Rosa removes Hector's shoe and out falls a pile of junk food. The audience gasps, then cheers.]''<br>
'''Man:''' "Why didn't I think of that." ''[The man's lady friend gives him a dirty look.]'' "I meanâ€¦ ''Boo''! You should be ashamed of yourself!"<br>
'''Camila:''' ''[Thinks]'' "Sounds like your control issues make Hector feel like less of a man."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Mad]'' "Control?! I don't try to control anyone! Get up Hector, we're leaving!"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Is about to get up, but realizes.]'' "Stop telling me what to do, SeÃ±ora Bossypants!"<br>
'''Audience:''' "Hector! Hector! Hector! Hector!"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Who are you calling bossy!? SeÃ±or Stinky!"<br>
''[They get really mad at each other.]''<br>
'''Camila:''' ''[To the audience]'' "What do you all think? Should the Casagrandes' makeup or breakup?"<br>
'''Audience:''' "Breakup! Breakup! Breakup!"<br>
''[Back at the apartment, the living room is half full of Frida's tears, and still filling up. Carlitos is riding Lalo like a speedboat.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Why!?"<br>
''[Back at the studio, the audience is still calling out.]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' "We need to do something, this has gone too far."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne runs out and pushes her Abuelo's back.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No! Stop! This is all my fault, I brought you guys here to save your marriage but I only made things worse. Abuelo, Abuela, you used to be so happy. Please don't breakup."<br>
''[Rosa and Hector look at each other, and start laughing hysterically at the idea.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Breakup? Where did you get that ridiculous idea?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "All the signs were there. Passive-aggressive vacuuming, Abuelo sleeping on the couch."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I wasn't passive-aggressive, I was just vacuuming. And Hector likes to sleep on the couch."<br>
'''Hector:''' "I do, it's closer to the kitchen."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ronalda, tu abuelo could never survive without me, and I love him no matter how many days he goes without a shower."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Si, and I love Rosa, even though she has feet the size of boats."<br>
''[Hector kisses Rosa on the cheek. The audience cheers.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "We may bicker to blow off steam. That doesn't mean we're not happy."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne hugs them. CJ and Carlota join in.]''<br>
'''Camila:''' "Well there you have it. All it took was a little communication and a little guidance from Camila. We'll be right back withâ€¦ something?"<br>
''[In the apartment, Frida has completely flooded the place. She, Carlitos and Lalo are all wearing snorkeling gear.]''<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Still sobbing]'' "It's so beautiful."<br>
''[She hugs Carlitos. Back at the studio.]''<br>
'''Camila:''' "Look, I'm happy for you, but we still have fifteen minutes left and I have no couple to save."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Thinks]'' "I think I can help with that."<br>
''[Later, Camila has a new couple.]''<br>
'''Camila:''' "We're back with a new couple going through a rough patch. Tell us more."<br>
''[The couple is Sergio and Priscilla, who squeals and sticks her head in the potted plant.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "See, she's been ghosting me."
