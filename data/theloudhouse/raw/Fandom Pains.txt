''[One dark and stormy night at the Loud House, Lucy and Edwin are getting ready to watch their favorite show.]''<br>
'''Spooky TV Announcer:''' "You're watching Fright TV, up next, the season premiere of ''Vampires of Melancholia''."<br>
'''Lucy:''' "This is it, Edwin. A whole new season of our favorite show, can't wait to watch it, just you and me."<br>
''[Just then, Lori and Leni appear out of nowhere.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Hey, Luce."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Scoot over."<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Frightened, jumps and yelps.]'' "What are you doing here? ''The Dream Boat'' is on Monday nights, remember?"<br>
'''Lori and Leni:''' "Duh, we're here to watch ''VoM''!"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "First, please don't call it that, second, you guys have never been interested in ''my'' show, why are you--?"<br>
''[Before she can finish, Lori and Leni climb over her to look at the screen.]''<br>
'''Lori and Leni:''' "Ah! There he is!"<br>
''[On screen, a taxi pulls up in front of the castle, and Blake Bradley comes out.]''<br>
'''Blake/Tristan:''' "Woah, this place looks sick."<br>
'''Lori and Leni:''' ''[Squealing]'' "Blake Bradley!"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Who?"<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Picks Lucy up.]'' "Duh, literally the cutest actor ''ever''."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Taking Lucy from Lori.]'' "Didn't you know he was gonna be a new character on ''VoM''?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Gets herself down.]'' "Sigh, it's called--"<br>
'''Blake/Tristan:''' "Yo! Anybody home?"<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Sighs]'' "Why is he literally so dreamy?"<br>
''[The show changes scenes from Tristan calling for someone, to Edwin coming out.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Yikes, who's that creepy guy?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "That's Edwin, the main character."<br>
'''Blake/Tristan:''' "H-Hey, Uncle Eddie."<br>
'''Edwin:''' "Tristan, my great-great-great-great grand nephew, this is a surprise."<br>
'''Blake/Tristan:''' "Looking good, are you sure you're really three hundred?"<br>
'''Edwin:''' "What brings you to Melancholia?"<br>
'''Blake/Tristan:''' "Just thought I'd crash at casa creepy for a while."<br>
'''Edwin:''' "Well, I must confess, I'm not really custom to sharing my castle with mortals."<br>
'''Blake/Tristan:''' "No worries bro, I can hang with anyone, now bring it in. Bro hug."<br>
''[Hugs his great-great-great-great grand uncle, much to Edwin's discomfort.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Sighs]'' "So gorge."<br>
'''Leni:''' "You can just tell, he'd be a great boyfriend."<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[From underneath Lori and Leni.]'' "What is happening?"<br>
''[Tristan and Edwin walk upstairs, Edwin stops to look at a picture of Griselda.]''<br>
'''Edwin:''' "Sigh."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Wait, who's she?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Griselda, the other main character, she's on a quest to the underworld right now, if you guys had watched the show from the beginning you'd--"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Cutting Lucy off]'' "Why are her teeth all pointy? Wait, his teeth are pointy too."<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Jumps up in between her sisters.]'' "Because they're vampires."<br>
''[Slightly less than an hour later, the end credits roll.]''<br>
'''Spooky TV Announcer:''' "Tune in next week, for more ''Vampires of Melancholia''."<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Sighs]'' "That was ''literally'' amazing."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Totes, this is definitely gonna be our new Friday night thing, Lori, me, you and ''VoM''."<br>
''[Lori rubs Lucy's hair as she and Leni head upstairs.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "It's ''Vampires of Melancholia''! ''[Sighs, and picks up Edwin]'' I have to put a stop to this."
----
''[A week later, Lori is marking off the calendar.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "How excited are you for tonight's episode?"<br>
''[Goes to help Leni with the dishes.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "So excited! According to rumors on social media, Tristan's going to turn the dungeon into a gym. Tristan working out, can you even?"<br>
''[They sigh dreamily.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Groans]'' "Let's hope this works Edwin." ''[Places him on the table, takes a deep breath, and goes over to Lori and Leni.]'' "Hey guys, now that we're all, um, ' ''VoM'' heads ', you have to join me in all of the super fun pre-show rituals."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Rituals?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Yeah, the stuff we fans do to get in to vampire mode. ''[dramatic pause]'' You guys are going to love them." ''[She dawns an evil grin. Later, the bathroom wall is covered with pictures of vampires.]'' "First, you have to look the part, with a full vampire makeover."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Observes the photos]'' "Eww, do we have to look so sickly?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Well, it's a really important part of watching the show, but if you're not in to it and you'd rather just go back to watching ''The Dream Boat''."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Don't be ridiculous. Come on, Leni. It'll be good contouring practice. ''[Picks up one of the photos]'' Look how much their cheek bones pop."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Gasps]'' "Good point!"<br>
''[Lucy growls.]''
----
''[Later, just as Leni and Lori are finishing up, Lori gets an idea.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Wait." ''[Runs out of the bathroom, walks back in, scares Leni by wearing fangs, and giggles.]'' "Halloween leftovers!"<br>
''[Leni giggles, and Lori shoves a pair into her mouth. Then a pair of fangs appear in Lucy's mouth.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Pointing at her teeth, and speaking in a Transylvanian accent.]'' "Look, I'm Tristan's weird old uncle."<br>
''[Lucy covers Edwin's eyes.]''
----
''[Later, they're all in the living room.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Next, you have to see the world from a vampire's perspective."<br>
''[Lori and Leni look at each other in confusion.]''
----
''[Later, Lori and Leni are uncomfortable while stuck in their position.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Uh, this is giving me a migraine."<br>
''[They are revealed to be hanging upside down like bats.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Yeah, and I'm getting a headache." ''[Lucy smiles - revealing her fangs, but it disappears when Leni gasps in excitement.]'' "Wait, is that my missing jelly sandal under the couch?" ''[Falls down, landing on her head, and checks under the couch. She finds her sandal.]'' "Wahoo!"<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Joining Leni]'' "And my missing ring!"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Gasps, and reaches under the couch, finding two dolls that looked remarkably like her and Lori.]'' "And Lucy, I found your creepy dolls!"<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Angrily takes the dolls.]'' "Give me those!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "We should def do this every week. We'll never lose anything again."<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Face palms herself]'' "Sigh."
----
''[Later that night, there are three coffins laid on the floor between the three girls.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Next, you have to watch the show as a vampire would, in one of these." ''[She gestures to the coffins. They all sit inside one.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[Holding her sore back]'' "Uh, this provides zero lumbar support."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Holding her sore back]'' "It's also really hard on your back."<br>
'''Lori:''' "I cannot spend a whole hour in this."<br>
''[Lucy dawns a fangy smile, but it soon disappears when Leni gets an idea.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Wait, I know! ''[races off, and soon returns carrying three pillows.]'' Decorative throw pillows! They'll add support, ''[throws the pillows to Lori and on Lucy.]'' and a little zhuzh."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Ooh! And we can use the lid to make a fun TV tray."<br>
''[Lucy's jaw drops in disbelief.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Wait, there's still one more ritual." ''[Runs off, and returns with a pitcher of homemade blood.]'' "This is an absolute must. Toasting every new episode with a refreshing glass of homemade blood."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Horrified, along with Lori.]'' "Eww!" ''[Lucy pours Leni a glass.]'' "I don't know if I can handle this."<br>
''[Tries to prevent herself from barfing.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "I get that. It's not easy being a fan of this show. I'll understand if you guys wanna bail."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Wait, ''[runs off, turns on the blender, and returns with new drinks.]'' Beet smoothies! They look just like blood, but now they're delicious ''and'' full of antioxidants. Yay!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Cheers!"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Sigh."<br>
''[They all toast their cups.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' "Ooh, ooh! It's starting."<br>
''[The lights turn off. While Lori and Leni slurp their drinks, the episode on the TV begins with Edwin writing a letter to Griselda.]''<br>
'''Edwin:''' "My darling Griselda, how I wish you were here to help me endure this visit from my boorish nephew. He actually asked me if I was a boxers or briefs man."<br>
''[Hears crashing sounds coming from the dungeon, goes to check and is shocked that Tristan turned it into a gym.]''<br>
'''Tristan:''' ''[Playing corn hole]'' "Oh yeah! Yo, Uncle Eddie. Wanna play some corn hole?"<br>
'''Edwin:''' ''[Horrified]'' "What happened to my castle?!"<br>
'''Tristan:''' "I redecorated it, bro! ''[Wraps his arm around him.]'' Put some boom in your gloom! And look, I got you a lid so we can match in the thatch! Now, how about a selfie with your favorite nephew."<br>
'''Edwin:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "I told you. I don't show up in these."<br>
''[Tristan takes the selfie, and looks at it, realizing that it is only himself in the photo.]''<br>
'''Tristan:''' "Oh right, my bad."<br>
''[The episode ends. Lori and Leni dreamily sighs, while Lucy growls in annoyance.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[rubbing Lucy's hair as she and Leni head upstairs.]'' "Good times, Luce. Can't wait for next week!"<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Holds Edwin. Groans]'' "As long as that fool Tristan is on the show, Lori and Leni are gonna keep ruining it for me." ''[Thinks of something]'' "Hmm... But what if he weren't on the show?"<br>
''[Evil laugh]''
----
''[The next day Lucy is holding a Morticians Club meeting.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "This emergency meeting of The Young Morticians Club is now called to order. I have a favor to ask. You guys watch ''Vampires of Melancholia'' right?"<br>
''[The other club members exchange glances.]''<br>
'''Haiku:''' "Eh, Not since Tristan's been on it."<br>
''[The other members agree at once.]''<br>
'''Persephone:''' He's totally ruining it.<br>
'''Bertrand:''' The bro must go.<br>
'''Boris:''' The worst.<br>
'''Morpheus:''' He's awful.<br> 
'''Dante:''' He's gross.<br>
''[Lucy is pleased with this.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "How would you like to help me get rid of him?"
----
''[Later, Lucy and the Morticians Club are going door to door with petitions. Lucy knocks on one person's door. It opens.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Hi. I'm collecting signatures to remove Blake Bradley from ''Vampires of Melancholia''. Would you sign?"
----
''[Later, she and the other club members meet up to compare progress. All the clipboards are handed over to Lucy.]'' "Okay. Pretty good, guys. We got forty-five signatures and fifteen pieces of candy from people who thought we were trick-or-treaters."<br>
''[Lucy and Haiku smile at each other.]''<br>
'''Lucy and Haiku:''' "Goth perks."
----
''[Back at the school.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Okay. Did everyone finish their protest letters to the studio?"<br>
'''Haiku:''' "Mine's a poem. Should we take these to the post office?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "No. That'll take too long. I have a better idea." ''[The Morticians Club strap their letters to a swarm of bats.]'' "You know what to do, Fangs, ''[petting her bat]'' and no biting."<br>
''[Haiku opens the window, and the bats fly away.]''
----
''[That Friday night, Lucy and Edwin are getting ready to watch TV.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "This is it, Edwin. Time to see if our protests were heard."<br>
'''Lori and Leni:''' ''[Excitedly prancing into the living room with their beet smoothies, their vampire faces, and wearing pink t-shirts.]'' "Who's ready for some ''VoM''?!"<br>
'''Lori:''' "Check out the shirts we made, 'TEAM TRISTAN'!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Don't worry, we made Team Edwin shirts for you guys."<br>
''[Leni places a black t-shirt on Edwin, and Lori hands the other one to Lucy.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Oh, uh, thanks."<br>
''[She takes the shirt. On the show, Edwin and Tristan are eating dinner.]''<br>
'''Tristan:''' "Great grub, Uncle Eddie, but you got any garlic for these fries?"<br>
'''Edwin:''' "Garlic?!  Are you serious?"<br>
'''Tristan:''' "Guess that's a neg. Hey, how 'bout we burn off these carbs with a post-meal workout?"<br>
'''Edwin:''' ''[Drops his knife and fork in outrage]'' "What?!" ''[Suddenly thinks of something]'' "Or instead of a workout, eh, how about we walk along the misty, slippery, cliffs of Melancholia?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Mmm, cardio." ''[Excitedly shakes her fists]'' "This should be fun."<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Yes, it should." ''[Evil grin]''<br>
'''Tristan:''' "Dude, this mist is like a built-in airbrush filter."<br>
'''Edwin:''' ''[Pretending to care]'' "Careful, Tristan. The cliffs."<br>
'''Tristan:''' ''[Walking backwards with his camera phone.]'' "It's cool, Uncle Eddie. Just gotta take this self- ''[falls off the cliff]'' iiiiieeeeeeee......!"<br>
''[Edwin smiles as Tristan falls to his demise.]''<br>
'''Lori and Leni:''' ''[Shocked and upset]'' "What?! Tristan! No!"<br>
''[The two hold each other, teary eyed.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Pretending to be upset.]'' "Oh no. Not Tristan, the horror."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Still sobbing, along with Lori.]'' "He was so young, and so ''cute''!"<br>
'''Lori:''' "How could ''VoM'' do this?! Uh... Sorry Lucy. I literally can't even deal right now!"<br>
''[The two sisters run upstairs crying.]''<br>
'''Lucy''' "We did it, Edwin. Our voices were heard, should we celebrate with some early Halloween candy?" ''[Pulls out two fun-sized candies.]''
----
''[A week later, Lucy marks off the calendar.]''<br>
'''Spooky TV Announcer:''' "And now, an all new episode of ''Vampires of Melancholia''."<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Happily sighs]'' "Blissful solitude at last."<br>
''[Lets out another happy sigh as the episode starts. Edwin is eating dinner.]''<br>
'''Edwin:''' "Why does something feel amiss? No more selfies, or protein shakes, or dreaded bro hugs, and yet, sigh. I feel a twinge of remorse." ''[Lucy looks at her bust of Edwin with disbelief.]'' "Yes, Tristan could be a bit of a fool, and his home gym did ruin my marble floors. But he meant well. After all, he just wanted to spend time with, family, ''[puts on the hat Tristan gave him.]'' and I drove him to his demise."<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Gasp." ''[looks at the shirt Lori and Leni made for her.]'' "And I am a cold, selfish, sister."<br>
''[Edwin runs to the cliffs where Tristan fell.]''<br>
'''Edwin:''' ''[Anguished]'' "Tristan! I'm sorry! Forgive me, Tristaaaan!"<br>
''[Edwin starts to cry over what he did, as does Lucy, who wipes the tears off her face.]'' <br>
'''Lucy:''' "Oh, Edwin. I know it's too late to get Tristan back, but maybe it's not too late for ''my'' sisters." ''[Pauses the show and goes to Lori and Leni's bedroom.]'' "Lori? Leni?" ''[Sees that they're not there.]'' "I guess it ''is'' too late. I blew it." ''[Walks over to the stairs.]'' "Sigh." ''[Walks down the stairs, and sees the door being unlocked, Lori and Leni walk in with paper grocery bags.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[To Leni]'' "So, Lisa wanted my ''used'' tissues and-"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Gasp. Lori, Leni, will you please watch ''Vampires of Melancholia'' with me? I know you probably don't want to now that Tristan's gone. The truth is, I just wanna hang out with you guys."<br>
'''Lori:''' "Of course we'll watch. Tristan may have been the reason we got ''into'' the show, but the reason we stayed is because its been so much fun, sharing it with ''you''."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Yeah. In fact, we were just at the store getting vampire themed snacks for tonight." ''[Reaches into her bag]'' "I got garlic bread, is that right?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Well, actually..." ''[thinks about it]'' "Never mind, it's perfect. Come on."<br>
''[Runs to the TV.]''
----
''[Later, the three are enjoying their garlic bread, while Edwin eats his dinner. Suddenly there is a knock at his door.]''<br>
'''Edwin:''' "Who could that be? ''[Walks towards the door.]'' A wandering traveler? A door to door salesman?"<br>
''[Opens the door to find, a very pale, Tristan. Lori, Leni, and Lucy gasp and their jaws drop in surprise.]''<br>
'''Tristan:''' "What's up, Uncle Eddie?"<br>
''[Tristan hugs his very confused uncle.]''<br>
'''Edwin:''' "Tristan? You're back! But how?" ''[Griselda walks in the door.]'' "Griselda?! You're back too?!"<br>
'''Griselda:''' "We crossed paths in the underworld. Bringing him back with me was a snap. Well, more of a bite."<br>
''[They both show their fangs, revealing that Tristan is now a vampire, too.]''<br>
'''Lori:''' ''[In union with Leni]'' "Yay! Tristan!"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[In union with Lori]'' "Yes! Ah!"<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[To Edwin]'' "Huh, guess my protest didn't affect the show after all. I'm glad."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Am I crazy? Or is Tristan even cuter as a vampire?"<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Well, the ''fangs'' do help."<br>
''[Lori and Leni hug Lucy, who smiles and hugs them back as the episode irises out.]''
