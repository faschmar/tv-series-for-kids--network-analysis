'''Dance Battle Machine:''' "Get ready!" ''[Yoon Kwan pixelates onto the screen]'' "Can you beat the one, the only, Yoon Kwan?" ''[Ronnie Anne pixelates onto the screen]'' "Three! Two! One! Dance!" ''[Ronnie Anne and Yoon Kwan dance. As does Ronnie Anne in the real world playing the game]'' "Time's up! Winner! Yoon Kwan! Life is full of dance! Don't give up!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, man, not again!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Awe! Yoon, he's even cooler in the game! But you were so close."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Thanks, Sid. Just a little more practice and that Yoon Kwan championship jacket will be ours."<br>
''[They look at said jacket, the photo of Yoon wearing it winks at them]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Don't worry. We'll make you the greatest K-pop dancer this city has ever seen."<br>
''[Meanwhile, Sergio is at the prize table, looking through a toy kaleidoscope. A pigeon comes up to him with more prizes]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks, knocking the prizes away]'' "No, pass." ''[Sancho brings one]'' "Been there, done that. Need a better prize." ''[Looks through the scope again, and finds the jacket Ronnie Anne and Sid want. Squawks]'' "Jackpot!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne is still playing the game, when Sergio interrupts, squawking]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Whoa!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Hey!"<br>
''[Sergio snaps his wing and his posse joins him]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Sorry. Got a hot date. Need the jacket to look... super fly."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Sorry, Sergio, that jacket's for the best dancer. And besides, you'll have to beat the second-place champion, Ronnie Anne."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[squawking]'' "Should be like taking candy from a baby."<br>
''[He and the pigeons laughs]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Okay. You're on, Sergio. Best dancer wins the jacket."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Let's dance."<br>
''[Hits a button on the pad and player two goes to bird mode. Sergio’s entourage scoots as the center square of Sergio’s dance pad opens, revealing a bird-sized dance pad]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "I had no idea it had that function."<br>
'''Dance Battle Machine:''' "Get ready!" ''[Ronnie Anne and Sergio pixelate onto the screen]'' "Three! Two! One! Dance!"<br>
''[The two players do just that, and are a very even match]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Wahoo! Go Ronnie Anne! You can do it!"<br>
''[Sergio and Ronnie Anne dance with all their might. Combos getting higher and higher]''<br>
'''Dance Battle Machine:''' "Time's up!" ''[Both players are tired and drop. Their entourages look. They both scored one million]'' "Tied game!"<br>
''[Everyone gasps and get in each other’s faces]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Sudden death!"<br>
'''Sergio:''' "You cheated!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "No way! That jacket's ours!"<br>
''[They don’t see Hector wander onto the machine]''<br>
'''Dance Battle Machine:''' "Keep going."<br>
''[Hector starts stumbling around, trying to catch his chocolate bar]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "You dance like a human!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Uh-uh. Rematch! You'll never beat my high score."<br>
'''Sergio:''' "I'm the K-pop King, baby!"<br>
'''Sid:'''  "Benchwarmer."<br>
'''Dance Battle Machine:''' "Winner!<br>
''[Everyone looks as Hector has finally got his chocolate bar, and is immediately handed the jacket]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Ay, qué bueno. I've been wanting a new bowling jacket." ''[Everyone is shocked]'' "Hola, chicos. I'll see you at home. Abuela's making pollo con papas."<br>
''[Leaves]''<br>
'''Dance Battle Machine:''' "Continue? Three! Two! One!"<br>
''[GAME OVER]''
