''[It's morning in Great Lakes City, Sergio opens his wardrobe]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Ah, what to wear?” ''[Sergio goes into his wardrobe and comes out wearing a scarf, sunglasses, beret, and holding a coffee, he sips and goes back in. He comes back out wearing a cap and bling and doing the running man. He goes back in and comes back out wearing swim goggles and a monokini, which has ridden up in the back]'' Ah! I hate all my clothes. Ooh.” ''[Sees something, he goes back in]'' “Forgot about these.” ''[Comes out wearing some old sunglasses]'' “Me like.”<br>
''[Sergio flies off, and a dark green chicken-like shape passes outside the window]''
----
''[In the living room, the family are watching the lucha libre wrestling match. La Tormenta stands on the top row, she's about to do the tornado twist. Carl and CJ square off, right on top of Ronnie Anne, they wrestle]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Guys, hey, I can't see.” ''[They continue wrestling, Ronnie Anne moves them aside]'' “Ooh, get ready for La Tormenta's signature move, in three… two…”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Flies in front of the TV. Squawks]'' “What'd I miss?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Aw man! I missed the move.”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Woah, cool shades Sergio.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “Tell me something I don't know. Vintage classics.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Oh good, they're showing the instant replay.” ''[They're about to, but the TV dies. The family groans]'' “Abuelo, the TV's on the fritz again.”<br>
''[Hector adjusts his beltline, cracks his knuckles, and starts pounding on the screen]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “Come on!”<br>
''[Meanwhile, Carlitos' farm animal sound toy ominously spins by itself, landing on the chicken]''<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Startled]'' “That toy is creepy! Carlos, please take out the battery.”<br>
''[Carlos tries to do so, but the compartment is empty]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' “That's odd, I haven't put the battery in it yet.”<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Still pounding the TV]'' “Ah! What's wrong.”<br>
''[Goes off and returns with a chair, just as the TV starts working]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Abuelo, stop, you fixed it.”<br>
''[Suddenly, Sergio lets out a yelp, he moves over to find an egg where he was sitting. He and Carl take a closer look]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Ew! Sergio laid an egg.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Wasn't me! It was Carl.”<br>
''[Sergio tosses Carl the egg]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Was not. Mom!”<br>
'''Frida:''' “Of course you didn't lay an egg mi pollito.”<br>
'''Carlos:''' “Yes, scientifically im-”<br>
''[Suddenly Carlos feels an uncomfortable sensation, and pulls an egg out of his own pants, which starts glowing green and floating, followed by the one Sergio and Carl found. Suddenly two more appear. Then, CJ belches one up, followed by Carlota and Lalo. There are now eight eggs glowing green and floating in a circle in the middle of the room above the family. Suddenly the lights start flickering and the dark green chicken shape appears behind them]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Gasps]'' “I know what this is, we're being haunted!”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Skeptical]'' “We are not being haunted.” ''[An egg floats closer to her]'' “Someone's obviously pranking us. There's gotta be string somewhere.” ''[Waves her hand over and under the egg]'' “Okay, no strings. Carl, how are you doing this?”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Don't look at me, look at that!”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne turns and sees the chicken shape. Now she's scared and runs]''<br>
'''Frida, Carlos, Bobby, CJ & Carl:''' “Chicken ghost!”<br>
''[The family is scared. Maria opens a compartment in the couch, Carlota jumps in followed by Lalo and Maria, right before some eggs splatter them. Carl and CJ get behind the curtains before some more eggs hit them. Ronnie Anne pulls down the shade and lets herself get rolled up in it. Frida and Carlos have already been splattered and run into the kitchen, the ghost chasing them. Carlitos is hiding in the fruit bowl, he turns and winks. Hectors shocked face gets splattered, and is then revealed to be a picture Hector is hiding behind, but he gets splattered too. Bobby attempts to hide behind the fridge door, but Sergio grabs him]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Human shield!"<br>
''[Bobby takes Sergio's hit, and gets splattered by numerous eggs from the fridge. Bobby slides next to the table. and an arm grabs him and pulls him under]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Everyone! Hide under the table with me quick!"<br>
''[Everyone joins them under the table]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[Sighs with relief]'' “I think we lost him.”<br>
''[Suddenly the table floats up, leaving them exposed]''<br>
'''CJ:''' “Think again.”<br>
''[The cabinets and drawers all open and all the kitchenware starts floating. The sink sprayer turns on and sprays everyone, they all make a run for it. They run out of the apartment and shake the water off]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' “At least all that water got the egg out of my hair.”<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' ''[Appears]'' “Knock knock.” ''[The family yelps when they see him, and he yelps back]'' “It's just me. I hear there's a ghost in the building.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Is it haunting you too!?”<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' “No, Hector texted me.” ''[Hector did text him. Rosa gives Hector a dirty look and he sinks out of sight]'' “I think I can help. Is it a good ghost or a bad ghost?”<br>
'''Carl:''' “It's a chicken ghost.”<br>
'''Bobby:''' “And it's definitely bad, it egged me.”<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' ''[Thinks]'' “Well don't worry Casagrandes'. In Japan, there's a spring festival where we throw beans to chase off evil spirits.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “It's worth a try.”
----
''[Back in the apartment, the kitchenware is still floating around the kitchen, as is the chicken ghost]''<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' “Now throw the beans with purpose.”<br>
'''Everyone:''' “Ghost be gone!”<br>
[Everyone throws beans into the kitchen from behind the dinner table. But the chicken ghost throws them right back, along with more food, and various other objects. Everyone ducks behind the table, except for Hector who catches everything in his mouth and eats it]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “This family's not gonna let good food go to waste. Ghost or no ghost.”<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' “If you'll excuse me, now, I must be gone.”<br>
''[Mr. Nakamura leaves, and Mr. Chang arrives]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' “Hey there Casagrandes'. Hector texted, I hear you have a ghost. Could it be an ancestor?”<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Scoffs]'' “Not unless we're related to a chicken.”<br>
'''Hector:''' “That would be on Rosa's side.”<br>
''[Hector laughs until he sees Rosa's expression towards him as he realized he offended her, he ducks out of sight again]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' “Well my family uses snap pops to scare off ghosts. We usually do it on New Years, but no reason we can't try it now.” ''[The family and Stanley are waiting outside the kitchen]'' “On my count. Three… Two… One… Happy new year!” ''[Remembers]'' “I mean, get out of here ghost.”<br>
''[They throw their snap pops into the kitchen. There's a lot of popping and no ghost sounds]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Laughs]'' “Take that ghost chicken.”<br>
''[Everyone looks into the kitchen. From the smoke appears a giant chicken made of fireworks, and he's mad. The chicken ghost fires. The family flees, except Stanle who is initially amazed]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' “I wasn't expecting the ghost chicken to have his own fireworks, impressive. And also…”<br>
''[Stanley screams, and runs, right out of the apartment, the firework chicken chasing him]''
----
''[Later, Arturo arrives]''<br>
'''Arturo:''' “Hola familia! I brought some ají verde salsa from Peru, so bring on the chicken.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Hector, chismoso, did you tell everyone?”<br>
''[Hector ducks out of sight again]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Comes out from under the table]'' “Does salsa help with chicken ghosts?”<br>
'''Arturo:''' ''[Scared]'' “Chicken ghost? I thought you were eating chicken.”<br>
''[Arturo sees the ghost right behind him, freaks out and dives into the couch]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “He's the chicken!”<br>
'''Arturo:''' “You're not wrong.”<br>
''[Just then, a couch cushion starts floating and Sergio ducks it before it hits him]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Hey! Watch it!”<br>
''[The cushion hits him again and starts throwing him around while the rest of the family gets up from behind the table. The cushion slams Sergio into the wall]''<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Horrified]'' “We're good people!” ''[Sobs]'' “Why are you haunting us!?”<br>
''The feathers from the cushion form an arrow, and points towards the only other bird in the room]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' “Hey, that arrows totally pointing to Sergio.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Scared, flies to the other side of the arrow]'' “Is not.”<br>
''[The arrow turns around]''<br>
'''Everyone else:''' “Is too.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Sergio, do you know this chicken?”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “I had a chicken roommate at flight school, but he moved to a farm, never heard from him again.” ''[Realizes]'' “Alfredo, is that you?” ''[The feathers form a mallet and bonk Sergio on the head, knocking him to the floor]'' “Yup, that's him.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Ghosts don't stick around unless they have unfinished business. Sergio, did you wrong this chicken?”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “No, he loved me.” ''[Gets hit with the cushion again]'' “I mean, we were rivals, but we were friendly rivals.” ''[Gets hit again]'' “Okay, okay, there was this one time.” ''[Flashback to Alfredo in his new car, which is suddenly pooped on. Sergio laughs, in the flashback, and now. Alfredo hits him again]'' “What, it was just a little poop. Can't you take a joke, Al?”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Sergio Casagrande! No wonder he's angry! You have to make it up to him, it's the only way to get rid of this ghost.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Okay, okay, I'll make amends.” ''[Takes out his calender]'' “Let's see, I have a little time next month.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Really mad]'' “Sergio!”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Oh look, I'm free today.”
----
''[Later, Sergio uncovers Alfredo's old car, which is in pretty rough shape]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Here it is, Alfredo's car. Okay, let's get to work, I'll supervise.”<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Takes out a bucket and sponge]'' “We didn't poop on it.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Well if you're gonna get technical, sheesh.” ''[Sergio cleans the car, and admires his reflection in the windshield]'' “Lookin' good.” ''[To the floating bucket]'' “There, cleaned your car, ya happy?” ''[Alfrerdo dumps the bucket on Sergio]'' “Not so happy.” ''[Gets a wet sponge dropped on his head]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' “Sergio, are you sure you didn't do anything else to that chicken?”<br>
''[Sergio thinks. Flashback to after he pooped on Alfredo's car]''<br>
'''Flashback Sergio:''' “Let me clean that up for you Al.”<br>
''[Sergio sprays the car with a hose and it goes flying. It crashes in the park and lands in the middle of a birthday party being held by Sancho and some pigeons, right on top a cake that reads 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALFREDO'. End of flashback]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Sergio, you ruined his birthday party?”<br>
'''Carl:''' “No wonder he's angry.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Okay, okay, I'll make it up to him.” ''[Suddenly the car gets pooped on again. The poop's owner is flying overhead]'' “Not helping, Sancho!”
----
''[Later, the family and some pigeons are re-celebrating Alfredo's birthday party]''<br>
'''All:''' ''[Singing to the chicken ghost]'' “Cumpleaños feliz, cumpleaños feliz, cumpleaños feliz, now go away please!”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Are we square now?”<br>
''[The balloons start popping themselves. Then, Alfredo picks up Sergio and makes him punch himself]''<br>
'''CJ:''' “Guess not.”<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[Getting annoyed]'' “Anything else you'd like to tell us, Sergio?”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Okay, there might be a tiny bit more to the story.”<br>
''[Return to the ruined birthday]''<br>
'''Flashback Sergio:''' ''[Sees a wallet under Alfredo's wing]'' “Ooh, my lucky day.” ''[Takes the money]'' “Everything's coming up Sergio.”<br>
''[End of flashback]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “So let me get this straight; you pooped on his car, ruined his birthday party, and stole his wallet?”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Yeah.”
----
''[Back at the apartment, Sergio is confronting the ghost, with his piggy back]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Okay, here's all of the money I took.” ''[Throws it all down]'' “With interest.” ''[The ghost just kicks it away]'' “Oh come on, I've made amends, for everything, what more do you want?”<br>
''[Alfredo flies into Carlos' nose and possesses him. He grabs Sergio]''<br>
'''Alfredo:''' “Bawk, bawk.” ''[Pecks Sergio]'' “That's not the end of the story. Bawk, bawk.”<br>
'''Carl & Carlota:''' ''[Gasp]'' “My dad's a chicken?”<br>

''[Sergio nervously smiles. Flashback to Alfredo in a full body cast in the hospital after Sergio crashed his car. Sergio arrives with flowers]''<br>
'''Flashback Sergio:''' “Sorry about your car crash buddy. Tough break.” ''[Sees Alfredo's sunglasses are still intact, and very shiny]'' “Ooh, dig the shades.” ''[Leaves the flowers and takes them]'' “Mind if I borrow them? You don't need 'em, no sun in here.” ''[Sergio puts the glasses on and flies away. Alfredo is really angry. End of flashback]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Oh, that's where I got these glasses.”<br>
'''Alfredo:''' ''[Still in Carlos]'' “Give them back! Bawk, bawk!”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “But they look so good on me.”<br>
''[Alfredo bawks again and the entire rest of Sergio's family starts floating]''<br>
'''Carl:''' “Give him the glasses!”<br>
''[Sergio breaks free]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' “How 'bout a nice toaster? Fancy smoothie maker? Or how about Carl? Take him.”<br>
'''Carl:''' “Hey!”<br>
'''Hector:''' “Sergio, give him those glasses! Right now!”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Fine! Take the glasses.”<br>
''[Throws them at Carlos' body. Alfredo reaches out, reclaims his sunglasses, and leaves Carlos. Alfredo dawns his sunglasses and rocks them once again. Appeased, he leaves and the family drops to the ground]''<br>
'''Carlota:''' ''[Gasps]'' “It worked.”<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Runs up and hugs her esposo]'' “Mi amor! You're not a chicken anymore.”<br>
'''Carlos:''' “Thank heavens.” ''[Coughs up a feather]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Well Sergio, I hope there are no other ghost chicken's out there that you've wronged.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “No way, I promise.” ''[Suddenly the farm animal sounds toy goes off again and points at the cow. Everyone groans at Sergio]'' “What? You didn't ask about cows.”<br>
