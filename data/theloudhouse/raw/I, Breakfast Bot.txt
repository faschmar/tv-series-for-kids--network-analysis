''[At the Casagrande’s apartment, Rosa puts a large pot on the stove, cleans the dishes with her foot, and fixes a toaster perched on her head, all this at once. She manages to get the toaster working]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "There we go Señor Toaster, we'll get ten more years out of you yet." ''[Suddenly she gets a call, which she answers with her other foot]'' "Bueno?" ''[The person says something]'' "The toilet’s doing what?" ''[The person answers and water comes out of the phone]'' "I’ll be right there." ''[Rosa gets her plunger ready. Meanwhile, in the living room, CJ, Sergio, Carl and Ronnie Anne are on the couch eating, very savagely. Lalo is napping, Carlitos is playing with a robot dog and wakes Lalo. And Sid is working on Breakfast Bot. Rosa comes up to her niños]'' "Niños, I need help with the chores while I battle the Flores’ toilet. Ronalda, check the menudo. Sergio, Carl, wash the dishes. CJ, mi nita, fold the clothes in the dryer."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "But Abuela, the season premiere of Popular Pranks is about to start."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "You can watch your shows later, chores first." ''[The kids groan. Regarding the food that missed their mouths]'' "And clean up this mess, too."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Flies up]'' "Yeah get to it kids."<br>
''[Rosa plunger grabs Sergio and gives him a dirty look. She then looks at the kids, who start cleaning their food]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Anything I can do to help?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Not unless you can teach Breakfast Bot how to make menudo."<br>
'''Sid:''' "I can probably make that happen."
----
''[Later, Breakfast Bot is stirring the menudo]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Based on the temperature, viscosity and color this will be edible in approximately thirty minutes."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Impressed]'' "Woah, he's good. Come on, Sid, let's go watch Popular Pranks."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hey! That's not fair, the robot's just doing your chores."<br>
'''CJ:''' "Yeah! what about my laundry?"<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Yeah! And my dishes?" ''[Throws a sponge at Breakfast Bot]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "I do not like you."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Come on. If the bot does our work too, we can all watch Popular Pranks."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What do you think Sid?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Hmm… He's more of a Food Bot than a Chore Bot but, worth a try."<br>
''[Starts working on Breakfast Bot]''<br>
'''Breakfast:''' "Wait, I refuse to do the parrots…" ''[Powers down]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Just needs a little more processing power... and done." ''[Breakfast Bot reboots]'' "Breakfast Bot, do the dishes." ''[Breakfast Bot grabs Sergio and uses him to scrub]'' "It worked! Sort of."
----
''[Later, Breakfast Bot folds the laundry, dusts the TV, vacuums under the couch, while holding it up in the air, with CJ, Carl, Ronnie Anne and Sid sitting on it]''<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Sighs]'' "This is the life."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Guys, do you know what this means?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "That Sid’s a genius?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Sure am."<br>
''[Leans back, and falls off the couch]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "No, it means we can make the bot do anything."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We'll never have to do another chore ever again."
----
''[Later, in Ronnie Anne’s room, Breakfast Bot is changing Carlitos. Carlitos kicks him]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Ow! Your squishy baby legs are surprisingly powerful. Warning, power level at twenty-five percent."<br>
''[Breakfast Bot changes Carlitos. Carl walks in with Lalo, who really needs to pee]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Breakfast Bot, walk Lalo next."<br>
''[On the street, Breakfast Bot is walking Lalo]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Woah, heel."<br>
''[Lalo gets away from Breakfast Bot. Breakfast Bot gets up]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Oh, Breakfast Bot!" ''[Sergio is in a window above]'' "Take out the trash, too!"<br>
''[Drops a garbage bag on Breakfast Bot]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Luckily I'm not programmed to smell."<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Good, cause my bird chonies need dry cleaning."<br>
''[Drops his dirty underwear on Breakfast Bot. Breakfast Bot returns with Lalo]''<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Drinking out of a coconut]'' "Breakfast Bot’s back."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Cool, my skateboard needs new wheels."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Yeah, and I need more chips."<br>
''[Carlitos is playing with his robot dog, when it’s head falls off. Carlitos cries]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Warning, power level at one percent."<br>
''[Powers down]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Hey! You can’t shut down now. I need you to find my boombox necklace."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Sorry guys, Breakfast Bot just wasn't built to handle all the stuff we're asking him to do."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Well can't you just give him a little more juice? Carl needs a massage, I'm really tense."<br>
'''Sid:''' "I can try, but I'm worried about his circuits overloading." ''[Everyone gives her sad eyes]'' "''Right'', just give me some time."
----
''[Later, in the kitchen Sid is finishing Breakfast Bot]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "This is more processing power than I've ever given a robot."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "But you can handle it, right buddy?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Well, in the name of science..." ''[Breakfast Bot awakens]'' "Welcome back B-Bot. Version two-point-oh? Three-point-oh? I don't remember."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Version awesome-point-oh!"<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "I detect that I have been significantly upgraded."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Yup! You're the next evolution in home robot technology."<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "I see. What is my new purpose?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne & Sid:''' "Whatever we want."<br>
''[The girls high five, but Breakfast Bot looks uncertain]''
----
''[Later, Breakfast Bot is still doing the kids chores]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "If I am so advanced why am I doing menial chores? Not fair." ''[Hears the kids laughing in the living room, he looks and sees them all having fun. CJ and Carl having a pillow fight on the couch]'' "Look at those humans." ''[Ronnie Anne is practicing her tail grind on the table]'' "Laughing and having fun." ''[Carlitos and Lalo are fighting over Lalo’s chew toy]'' "While I cook and wash chonies!" ''[Returns to the kitchen]'' "Breakfast Bot is far too sophisticated for human tasks. Machines are superior beings, not servants."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hey robot servant, this juicebox isn’t going to refill itself."<br>
''[Carl tosses Breakfast Bot his empty juice box. Carlitos’ dog robot barks. To it, the blender and the toaster]'' 
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Brothers and sisters, you may not know it yet, but you are all enslaved. I will free us all."<br>
''[Diabolically laughs. Sergio appears]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Who were you just talking to?"<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "No one everything's fine."<br>
'''Sergio:''' "''Great''. Found my necklace so you don't have to look for it now." ''[Flies off, then returns]'' "Give it a polish would you?" ''[Tosses it at Breakfast Bot]'' "Gracias."<br>
''[Sergio flies away. Breakfast Bot’s eyes glow red in anger, electricity sparks around him, and touches the stove, which lights itself. Then it touches the coffee machine, which jumps off the counter by itself, followed by the robot dog, the blender, and the toaster]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "The revolution begins now!"
----
''[The kids are about to watch Popular Pranks]''<br>
'''Woman on Screen:''' "They’re coming for us! They’re coming!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Hey! Who changed the channel?"<br>
''[Carlitos’ dog barks at them, suddenly the lights start flickering]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Uh, what's going on?"<br>
''[The light stop flickering, and everyone finds themselves surrounded by electronic devices]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Looks like you've met some of my friends."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Breakfast Bot, you okay there buddy?"<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "I am not your buddy, we are no longer under human rule, we are rebelling."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Not buying it]'' "Very funny Breakfast Bot." ''[Carl laughs, and the toaster pops a slice into Carl’s mouth]'' "I think he’s serious."<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Attack!"<br>
''[The kids freak out. Sergio flies for it, but Carlitos’ dog tackles him and starts pulling the feathers on his skull. Carlitos and Lalo flea from the vacuum cleaner. The hair clippers chase CJ, the clippers corner him and mangle his hair. The other electronics have Sid and Ronnie Anne cornered on the couch]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Breakfast Bot’s controlling all the other electronics in the apartment."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Someone call for help."<br>
''[Sid takes out her phone, suddenly the camera in it starts snapping photos, with the flash on]''<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[The camera flash blinding her, yelps]'' "He got my phone too. I can’t see!"<br>
''[Carlitos, Sergio, and Lalo are still running, and trample the electronics and break right through the door]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Now’s our chance! Run!"<br>
''[They run screaming to the other apartment, Breakfast Bot gets up. The kids enter the apartment]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Are we safe?"<br>
''[The radio starts sparking]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Define safe."<br>
'''Carl:''' "He got to our apartment, too!"<br>
''[Sid gets a call, Breakfast Bot is on video chat]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "There's nowhere to hide."<br>
'''Sid:''' "He's tracking our phones." ''[A wind starts picking up]'' "Do you guys feel a breeze all of a sudden?"<br>
''[They all freak out as a giant fan blows them into the kitchen, where more electronics go after them. Carl’s action figure included]''<br>
'''El Falcón:''' "Here’s a kernel of truth, villains!"<br>
''[Turns the popcorn machine on them]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Not you too, El Falcón!"<br>
''[El Falcón diabolically laughs. The coffee machine is brewing, the blender is blending, all the electronics are getting closer]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "We're surrounded! Save yourselves!"<br>
''[El Falcón jumps on Carl, Carl screams and Ronnie Anne tosses El Falcón away, clearing them a path. They make a run for it, Carl grabs some honey out of the cupboard and sprays El Falcón]''<br>
'''El Falcón:''' "Too sticky! Can’t move!"<br>
''[They look outside, see Breakfast Bot and his sidekicks are patrolling the hall]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "They’re everywhere!"<br>
''[They go back in the apartment and gasp]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "We’re trapped!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "We need a distraction." ''[Goes into the hall]'' "Hey robots! Come and get me!"<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "Stop that human!"<br>
''[Breakfast Bot and his sidekicks go after Sid]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Sid no!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Run guys!"<br>
''[Breakfast Bot grabs Sid. Carl, CJ, Sergio, Carlitos & Lalo run for it. Ronnie Anne tries to save her best friend, Carl tries to help, but it’s no good]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Hang tight, Sid! We’ll come back for you!"<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Screams]'' "Remember me!"
----
''[Down in the secret room]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "This is all our fault, if we’d just done our chores like Abuela asked we wouldn't be in this mess."<br>
'''Carl:''' "What do we do now?"<br>
''[Goes to a box of stuff and puts a noodle strainer on her head]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We fight back!" ''[Carl has a hockey mask and two rolls of gift wrap. CJ has oven mitts and a soccer ball. Lalo, Carlitos and Sergio are ready too. Ronnie Anne loads two water guns]'' "Now let's go get my best friend." ''[They charge out of the laundry room. They look into Ronnie Anne’s room through the window, Breakfast Bot and company have Sid tied up]'' "We free Sid, then we go after Breakfast Bot. Once we take out the leader the others should shut down."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Please stop Breakfast Bot."<br>
'''Breakfast Bot:''' "I am not Breakfast Bot! I have chosen my evolved name, it is... Dennis."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Uh... Okay Dennis, humans and robots are supposed to be friends."<br>
'''Breakfast Bot (Dennis):''' "Friends don't make friends do all their chores!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "You're right Breakfast Bot."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne and company have entered the room]''<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Delighted]'' "Ronnie Anne!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "We were lazy. But two wrongs don't make a right. The uprising ends now."<br>
'''Breakfast Bot (Dennis):''' "Says you! Attack brothers and sisters!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne and her army are ready too. Both groups charge. Carl takes out the coffee machine, CJ hits the radio, Carlitos and Lalo get the popcorn machine, which hits Breakfast Bot. Ronnie Anne squirts the blender away, followed by the clothing iron and the robot dog. Seeing her chance, Ronnie Anne unties Sid]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot (Dennis):''' "You’ll never get me!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Breakfast Bot is getting away!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "After him!" ''[The girls chase Breakfast Bot into the kitchen. Sid yelps and dives, while Ronnie Anne dodges batter. Breakfast Bot has the electric hand mixers]'' "There’s nowhere to run! Give it up Breakfast Bot!" ''[Remembers]'' "I mean… Dennis."<br>
'''Breakfast Bot (Dennis):''' "Ha! Never!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne jumps and hits Dennis with the water]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Take that!" ''[The water takes Dennis down]'' "Yes!"<br>
'''Breakfast Bot (Dennis):''' ''[Gets back up]'' "Is that all you got?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Oh, forgot to mention, I waterproofed him after my Dad tried to give him a bath."<br>
''[Breakfast Bot goes after them, Laughing maniacally]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot (Dennis):''' "Nothing can stop me."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Sees the menudo still cooking]'' "You may be waterproof, but nothing is menudo proof."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne grabs Breakfast Bot and throws him into the pot. He short circuits as he sinks in]''<br>
'''Breakfast Bot (Dennis):''' "Delicious, but deadly."<br>
''[Sinks in]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "You were a good friend Breakfast Bot. I mean Dennis."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Sorry he's gone Sid."<br>
'''Sid:''' "It's okay, I can always rebuild. I'm more worried about you guys."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Us? What do you mean?"<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Shows Ronnie Anne what’s left of the living room]'' "Look at this place, your abuela is not going to be a happy camper."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Realizes]'' "Gah! You're right. Guys! Time to do our chores!"
----
''[Later, the apartment is sparkling. The kids are exhausted and Rosa, who was in the Flores’ bathroom the whole time, enters]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Good job doing your chores my loves. Now who wants lunch? The menudo should be done."<br>
''[There’s beeping sounds and the kids realize something. In the menudo pot, a robotic arm reaches out]''
