''[​Lincoln is walking outside his house to the tree so he can sit down and read comics.]''​<br />'''Lincoln:''' ''[to the viewers]'' "Ahh, nothing like reading comics on a peaceful summer--"<br />''[A horn is honking and Lincoln screams, startled at the sound; it came from Luan in her clown outfit carrying her birthday props on a unicycle.]''<br />'''Luan:''' "Whoa! A little help?" ''[falls off her unicycle]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' ''[helps her up]'' "Back from another birthday party?"<br />'''Luan:''' ''[a bowling pin falls out of her mouth]'' "Uh, my third gig this weekend. I could really use an assistant. Hey, what about you? You're great with Gary."<br />''[Gary chomps on Lincoln's comic.]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Hey, stop that! I thought Lucy was helping you."<br />''[Flashback of Luan performing balloon animals at a circus themed birthday party.]''<br />'''Luan:''' "And now, if my assistant will just hand me one more balloon, we'll have a pterodactyl."<br />''[As Luan sees an empty corner, Lucy appears behind her with a balloon and startles her, popping the balloon in the process.]''<br />'''Boy:''' ''[To Lucy]'' "You killed the dinosaur!"<br />''[The kids start booing. A red FIRED sign appears over Lucy's Funny Business ID Card and a buzzer sounds. End flashback.]''<br />'''Luan:'''​ ''[Picks up a rubber chicken]'' "Lucy didn't work out. Neither did Lynn."<br />''[Flashback of Luan juggling fruit while riding on a unicycle at a pirate themed birthday party.]''<br />'''Luan: '''​"''Water'' you say we add some melon?"<br />​''[The kids cheer. Lynn throws a watermelon like a football, but accidentally hits Luan. The kids boo the performance. A red FIRED sign appears over Lynn's Funny Business ID Card and a buzzer sounds. End flashback.]''<br />'''Luan: '''​"Or Leni."<br />''[Flashback to another circus themed birthday party.]''<br />'''Luan: '''​"Why are clowns never bored? ‘Cause we're good at keeping occu-''​pied''​." ''[clears throat]'' "​I said, good at keeping occu-''pied''​."<br />''[Luan looks where Leni is, but there's nothing there but a pie. She turns and sees Leni in the crowd. Luan facepalms at this, walks to the pie and slaps it to her face, making the kids and Leni cheer. A red FIRED sign appears over Leni's Funny Business ID Card and a buzzer sounds. End flashback.]''<br />'''Luan:''' ​"​Or Lisa."<br />''[Flashback to a medieval themed birthday party as Luan does a trumpet fanfare dressed as a jester.]''<br />'''Luan:''' ​"Hey, Birthday Boy. Why don't you take the seat of honor?"<br />''[As the boy sits down, a farting noise from the Whoopee cushion is heard which Luan and the other kids laugh at.]''<br />'''Lisa:''' ''[taking the cake away]'' ​"No, no! No one eat that cake! It clearly causes gastrointestinal distress."<br />''[The kids start crying. A red FIRED sign appears over Lisa's Funny Business ID Card and a buzzer sounds. End flashback.]''<br />'''​Lincoln:''' ''[sarcastic]'' "Well, I am so honored to be your fifth choice."<br />'''Luan: ''' ​"Come on, Lincoln. Please? I really need your help."<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "I don't know. I´m not really the performing type. I don't want to make a fool of myself on stage."<br />'''​Luan:''' ​"Don't worry. That's my job. All you have to do is help with the props."<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "Uh, I don't know think it's for-" ''[notices Luan holding a slice of cake in a container.]'' "What's that?"<br />'''​Luan:''' "Ah, just birthday cake. I always get sent home with leftovers."<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "Oh..." ''[starts drooling upon seeing the dessert.]''<br />'''​Luan:'''​ "Usually I share it with my assistant. But since this job isn't for you--"<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ ''[Takes the cake]'' "When did I say that?"<br />''[Luan smiles, A green HIRED sign appears over Lincoln's Funny Business ID Card and a bell rings.]''
----
''[At the first birthday party, like the one Leni got fired after, Luan is setting up the pie joke from earlier.]''<br />'''Luan:'''​ "Why are clowns never bored? 'Cause we're good at keeping occu-''​pied''​."<br />''[Lincoln is about to throw the pie at Luan's face, but loses balance after tripping on a whipped cream can, and lands with a loud crash.]''<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "Sorry!"<br />
''[The kids are laughing and cheering.]''<br />
----
''[Lincoln and Luan are on their way home.]''<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "That was awesome. The part when I tripped and then the audience laughed, and then clapped? Amazing!"<br />'''Luan: ''' ​"Glad you enjoyed it. Now here, I need you to clean this. Gary pooped in it."<br />''[Lincoln gets grossed out while a green stinky fume comes out of the top hat.]''
----
''[At the second birthday party, which is another pirate theme, Luan is juggling fruit while riding on her unicycle.]''<br />'''Luan:'''​ "''​Water''​ you say we add some melon?"<br />''[The kids cheer. Lincoln appears running on a watermelon.]''<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ ''[loses balance]'' "Whoa, nelly!" ''[falls on it]''<br />''[The kids laugh]''
----
''[Luna's and Luan's room]''<br />'''​Lincoln: '''​"Man, great crowd, huh?"<br />
'''Luan:'''​ "Yeah, super. So, what was that all about with the watermelon?"<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "Well, you know, audiences seem to love it when I fall down so--"<br />'''​Luan:''' ​"Let me worry about the audience. You take care of deodorizing these clown shoes."<br />''[Lincoln exits the room while taking the clown shoes, then sees Lynn and Lana walking.]''<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "Whoopsy-daisy!" ''[falls and rolls at a distance while a loud crash is heard.]''<br />''[Lynn and Lana laugh at his performance.]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' ''[takes a bow; to the viewers]'' ​"See? I do know what audiences like."
----
''[At the third birthday party, like the one Lucy got fired after, Luan is making something with balloons.]''<br />'''​Luan:''' ​"And now, if my assistant will hand me one more balloon, we'll have a pterodactyl."<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ ''[high-pitched voice while covered in balloons.]'' "I went a little overboard with the helium. Whoa, good gravy!" ''[falls back as a loud crash is heard, getting the kids to laugh and cheer.]''<br />''[Luan shakes in anger.]''
----
''[At the fourth birthday party, Luan juggles plates on her nose and both hands.]''<br />'''Luan:''' ​"What did one plate say to the other? ​Lunch' is ''on me''."<br />''[She and the kids laugh.]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' ''[holding a stack of plates]'' ​"Gadzooks!" ''[loses balance and lets his plates and Luan's plates fall down and break.]''<br />''[The kids crack up.]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' "I guess lunch is on ''me''."<br />''[As the kids laugh, Luan gets ticked off at Lincoln.]''<br />'''Bratty Kid's Mom:''' ​''[laughing]'' "He is hilarious!"<br />'''Fat Mom:''' ​"I know. LOL. I just learned what that means."<br />''[The other moms look at her unimpressed.]''
----
''[At the fifth birthday party, which is another medieval theme, Luan does a trumpet fanfare.]''<br />'''​Luan:'''​ "All right, Birthday boy. Why don't you take the seat of honor?"<br />''[As Lincoln sits on the seat, the Whoopee cushion's farting noise is heard from under it.]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' ​"Holy macaroni!" ''[falls back as a loud crash is heard.]''<br />''[The kids laugh like always; Lincoln is signing autographs while Luan angrily puts away her clown stuff.]''<br />
----
''[while going back home]''<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "Boy, we are killing it. But I've been thinking, maybe you should do a little less of the talky stuff and more of the pratfalls." ''[Enraged, Luan then drop all of her supplies and turns to Lincoln, he's shocked.]''<br />'''Luan:'''​ "Are you kidding me?!"<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "What?"<br />'''​Luan:'''​ "Look, Lincoln. Just because you got a few laughs does not make you an expert on clowning. There's a lot more to it than just falling on your butt."<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "Well, the audience sure seems to like my--"<br />'''Luan:'''​ "Lincoln, enough! No more pratfalls. I am the clown. You are the assistant. Now go refill these whoopee cushions."<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "But they're already inflated."<br />''[Luan deflates them at her brother's face.]''<br />'''Luan:'''​ ''[frustrated]'' "Not anymore!"<br />''[Luan walks to the house, opens the door then slams it.]''<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "Oh, yeah?! Well, that would've been funnier if you'd fallen on your butt!"
----
''[At Luna and Luan's room, Lincoln is refilling the whoopee cushions.]''<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "How dare she speak to me like that!" ''[inflates a whoopee cushion]'' "After everything I've done for this business?" ''[inflates another]'' "You'd think she'd have a little more--"<br />''[Phone rings]''<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ ''[answers it]'' "Funny Business, Inc. Your fun is our business. Lincoln speaking."<br />'''Woman on the phone:''' ''[chatters]''<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "Yes, we're available the 11th."<br />'''​Woman on the phone:'''​ ''[chatters]''<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "What?"<br />'''Woman on the phone:'''​ ''[chatters]''<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "Oh, really?"<br />'''​Woman on the phone:'''​ ''[chatters]''<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "Great. See you the 11th."<br />''[Luan walks into her room.]''<br />'''​Luan:'''​ "Who did we just book?"<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "Actually, the correct question would be, who did <u>I</u> just book?"<br />'''​Lisa:''' ''[calling from her and Lily's room]''​ "You're both wrong! It's 'whom'!" ''[slams her door]''<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "They only wanted me."<br />'''​Luan:'''​ "Yeah, right."<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "It's true. You may not recognize my talent, but apparently the birthday party community does."<br />'''​Luan:'''​ "So, what are you gonna do for your act? Fall on your butt for an hour?"<br />'''Lincoln:'''​ "That's exactly what I'm going to do, 'cause the audiences love it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go put on my padded underwear."<br />''[Luan gets angry, kicks the glass case and it shatters. Gary hops down and eats some cake.]''<br />
----
''[At the sixth and last birthday party]''<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "So, how old is the birthday girl? Four? Five?"<br />'''Maggie's Mom:'''​ "Thirteen."<br />''[It's revealed that the birthday party is full of emo tweens. One of them hits a pinata and hugs it immediately.]''<br />'''​Lincoln:'''​ "Oh. A little older than usual crowd, but no problem. My comedy is ageless."
----
''[The next scene, Lincoln throws a banana peel on stage.]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Hey, guys! Who's ready to laugh?" ''[slips on a banana peel]'' "Whoopsie doodle! Now who put this here?"<br />'''Maggie:''' "Um, you did, obviously."<br />'''Lincoln:''' ''[shakes his head and holds up gag glasses.]'' "Maybe these glasses will help me see better!" ''[puts on the glasses and the eyes pop out and falls onto Maggie's poster.]'' "Eye-a-watha!" ''[gets back up and takes off the glasses.]'' "I really gotta get my prescription checked."<br />'''Maggie:''' "Mom, look what that loser clown did to my poster."<br />''[Lincoln takes the poster off of him. The emos get their phones out and text.]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Oh, look at that! I have a message, too! Mom, didn't I tell you not to text me at..." ''[falls on the table as the cake flies into the air.]'' "Whoa!" ''[the cake lands on him.]'' "Remember, guys. Never walk and text!"<br />'''Tween #1:''' "Ugh, now he's gonna lecture us?"<br />'''Maggie:''' ''[scowls]'' "He ruined my cake! Mom, why did you hire him? I swear, if I had a door around me, I would slam it so hard right now!"<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Um, excuse me, everyone. There will now be a brief, unscheduled intermission. Text amongst yourselves!"<br />''[Lincoln runs off stage but is stopped by Maggie's Mom.]''<br />'''Maggie's Mom:''' "Where are you going? I paid you to perform for an hour."<br />'''Lincoln:''' "But I'm doing my best material, and they hate me."<br />'''Maggie's Mom:''' "Well, try something else. You're a professional clown, aren't you?"<br />''[Lincoln looks over at the other parents.]''<br />'''Maggie's Dad:''' "Remind me not to book Funny Business, Inc. for my kid's birthday."<br />'''Fat Mom:''' "Me neither."<br />'''Bratty Kid's Mom:''' "Oh, me neither. I don't want my kid to hate me."<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Sorry, gotta run to the little clown's room."<br />''[Lincoln runs inside a photo booth to call Luan with his phone.]''<br />'''Luan:''' "Funny Business, Inc. Your fun is our business!"<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Luan!"<br />'''Luan:''' ''[makes static noises]'' "I'm sorry, I can't hear you. My clown car's going through a tunnel."<br />''[As Luan hangs up the phone, it rings again and she answers again.]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Luan, it's me."<br />'''Luan:''' "I know. That's why I hung up."<br />''[She hangs up the phone again, but it rings once again and she answers once more. She looks irritated.]''<br />'''Luan:''' "This is a business line, Lincoln! What do you want?"<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Luan, I'm bombing out here. You gotta help me, please!"<br />'''Luan:''' ''[sarcastic]'' "Oh! How could ''I'' possibly help ''you''? ''You're'' the clowning expert."<br />'''Lincoln:''' "No, I'm not. You are. You told me there's a lot more to clowning than just falling on your butt, and you were right. Will you please come help me?"<br />'''Luan:''' "I don't know, Lincoln. Maybe bombing would be a good learning experience for you."<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Well, there's one other thing. I think I'm ruining the reputation of Funny Business, Inc. These parents are brutal!"<br />'''Luan:''' "Don't move! I'll be right there." ''[hangs up and puts on her helmet, which produces a bizarre squishing sound, meaning only one thing.]'' "Ugh, Gary!"<br />''[Gary nervously blushes]''
----
''[As Lincoln is still in the photo booth looking nervous, Luan appears on her unicycle.]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Luan! Wait, how did you know I was in here?"<br />'''Luan:''' ''[holds out some photos of Lincoln from the photo booth. Most show Lincoln looking freaked out. Only one he posed for.]'' "Well, this was a pretty good clue."<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Oh! So, what's the plan?"<br />'''Luan:''' "Okay, let's see what we've got here."''[observes the crowd]'' "Hmm, Emo tweens. Notoriously tough crowd. But, don't worry, this isn't my first mope fest."
----
''[The next scene, Luan is seen on stage dressed as a mime and pretends to be trapped inside a box.]''<br />'''Maggie:''' "Oh, I get it. She's, like, trapped in a box. That's exactly how I felt when my mom said I couldn't dye my hair purple."<br />''[Lincoln, who is also dressed as a mime, looks from backstage and smiles while Luan pretends to climb a ladder.]''<br />'''Tween #1:''' "Wow. It's like the soul crushing pointlessness of seventh grade."<br />''[Luan goes backstage to get Lincoln, who is feeling nervous.]''<br />'''Luan:''' "You ready to do this?"<br />'''Lincoln:''' ''[nervously]'' "I don't know."<br />'''Luan:''' "You'll be fine. Just follow my lead."<br />''[Both Lincoln and Luan walk onstage and do a mirror routine.]''<br />'''Maggie:''' "Wow! It's about how we're all just, like, ''clones''."<br />'''Tween #2:''' "That's what I was gonna say."<br />'''Maggie:''' "Exactly."<br />''[Lincoln and Luan finish their routine and the goth kids slowly give an applause.]''<br />'''Maggie's Dad:''' "I have to get their business card."<br />''[The other parents murmur in agreement.]''<br />'''Bratty Kid's Mom:''' "Well, I call the weekend of the 22nd."<br />''[The goth kids start cheering and a single black rose is tossed onto stage as Luan picks it up.]''
----
''[Later, Lincoln and Luan are heading home with their props and costumes; Luan is riding her unicycle.]''<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Thanks for saving my butt. You were amazing out there. And I'm sorry for the way I was acting."<br />'''Luan:''' "It's okay. I remember how great it was to get my first big laugh. I shouldn't have been so harsh. Still my assistant?"<br />'''Lincoln:''' "Still your assistant. Let me get those for you." ''[accidentally rips the bag and slips on the spilled whoopee cushions.]'' "Whoa!"<br />''[Lincoln lands on them, which all make farting sounds.]''<br />'''Luan:''' ''[chuckles]'' "You know, that actually was kind of funny. Here, let me help..." ''[Her unicycle slips on another whoopee cushion, sending her flying.]'' "Whoa, good gravy!" ''[lands on the whoopee cushions and Lincoln and they laugh.]'' "Hiawatha!"<br />''[The two siblings do pratfalls as they land on the whoopee cushions and laugh again.]''
