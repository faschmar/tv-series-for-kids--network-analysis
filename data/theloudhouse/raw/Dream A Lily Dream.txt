{{Transcript}}
''[Night outside the Loud House. Lily is heard crying, and the lights in her and Lisa's room turn on.]''<br>
'''Rita:''' "It's OK, Lily. Mommy's here. Shh."<br>
''[The lights turn off. Lily resumes bawling.]''<br>
'''Louds:''' ''[annoyed]'' "Not again."
----
''[The next day in the kitchen, early morning. A sleep-deprived Lily and Lincoln are eating cereal, but Lincoln is so exhausted he face-plants into his cereal, causing Lily to flinch. An also sleep-deprived Lynn Sr. approaches with a burrito.]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[groggy]'' "Who had the breakfast burrito wrapped in a cozy tortilla with fluffy egg pillow?" ''[collapses]''<br>
'''Lola:''' "That's three nights in a row Lily's kept us up! My beauty is delicate; I can't handle another night without sleep!"<Br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Poor Lily. Still having bad dreams?"<br>
'''Lily:''' ''[whines]'' "Nightmares!"<br>
'''Luna:''' "What's going on in that noggin of yours, little dude?"<br>
''[Lily gets off her chair, dumps the trash bin, and turns the contents straight before making a scary face. The others have no idea what she means, so she goes to the fridge, grabs a squid, and waves its tentacles at them.]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "My ca-Lynn-mari? I don't get it." ''[Lily throws the squid to the ground and jumps on it, spraying ink on the fridge.]'' "There's nothing wrong with my ca-Lynn-mari!"<br>
''[The others disagree.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "I agree with Father. The nightmares are most likely not gastronomically induced, although your squid could benefit from a pinch of salt and a dash of inspiration."
----
''[In her and Lisa's room, Lily is finger-painting something on a piece of paper]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Good idea, Lily! A visual aid!"<br>
''[Lily hands over her finger-painting to Lisa.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Hmm. Let me examine this abstract-" ''[gasps]'' "Oh my stars and exoplanets!"<br>
''[Lily's finger-painting shows herself, Lisa, Trashy, and Tentacle.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Trashy and Tentacle... ''I've'' been causing your nightmares!" ''[groans]'' "And here I thought I'd been shielding you from my experiments. Oh, thank goodness you never saw my research on Flip's DNA. Two words: double butt-crack." ''[Both of them wince in disgust]'' "But don't worry. I'll figure out how to remedy this situation."
----
''[Later, Lisa is unveiling her latest invention to her family.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Family, I have discovered the source of Lily's nightmares: me."<br>
''[She shows Lily's finger-painting. Her family gasps, including Lucy's signature "gasp".]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Gasp."<br>
'''Lisa:''' "To fix this situation, I give you: The Dream Machine!"<br>
''[She takes the tarp off and unveils the machine; parts of Lola's ride are visible]''<br>
'''Lola:''' ''[Suspiciously]'' "''Hey'', did you use parts of my princess ride?!"<br>
''[Lisa sheepishly hides the hood of Lola's car, kicking it away; no questions.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Please. Save your questions for the end." ''[grabs modified colanders]'' "Now, these modified pasta strainers will allow the wearer to enter Lily's nightmare and defeat the monsters. Once Lily sees them destroyed, she'll realize there's nothing to be afraid of."<br>
''[Lily babbles in agreement.]''<br>
'''Lynn:''' "Dibs on monster-mashing!"<br>
'''Lola:''' "Hey, I don't think so!"<br>
''[The other siblings start fighting in a fight cloud. Lisa pulls a lever on Lily's crib. A siren goes off.]''<br>
'''Alarm:''' "Fight cloud alert! Fight cloud alert!"<br>
''[The other siblings stop.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Having predicted your rambunctious response, I have selected which of you will be going. Lincoln for his video game skills..." ''[Lincoln smiles and gives a thumbs up, but is kicked by Lucy's foot]'' "...Lynn for her physical strength..." ''[Lynn flexes a muscle and chuckles]'' "...Lola for her unchecked aggression..." ''[Lola growls and struggles]'' "...and Leni because she and Lily speak the same language."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Poo-poo!"<br>
'''Lily:''' "Poo-poo!"<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Now, let's get to work."
----
''[Late at night, Lily is fast asleep. Lisa is calibrating her machine when Lynn Sr. gives her some food.]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[Whispering]'' "Here you go, Lis. I made you some nightmare mission ca-Lynn-mari."<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Didn't eat it at dinner, won't eat it in a nightmare. But thanks."<br>
''[She smiles a sneaky smile and puts the calamari in her backpack.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Alright, team, it's go time. We'll need nightlights..." ''[Lynn grabs one]'' "...stuffed animals..." ''[Lola puts a stuffed animal in her backpack]'' "...and warm milk."<br>
''[Lincoln pours milk in his milk blaster and drinks the leftovers, getting a milky mustache.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Ha, a nightmare's worst nightmare."<br>
''[The team is fully geared up now.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Team, the last piece of equipment is your return button. If you run into trouble, press it and you'll wake up." ''[The others look at their return buttons, confused.]'' "Speaking of waking up, the rest of you must keep Lily asleep while we're in her dream. If she wakes up before us, we'll be trapped inside her dream forever."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Wait, you're just mentioning that ''now''?!"<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Well, we'll be fine. The odds are in our favor, more or less." ''[Lincoln groans]'' "My assistant Lull-a-bot will now transport you into Lily's dream."<br>
'''Lull-a-bot:''' ''[tucking Lincoln, Lisa, Leni, Lynn, and Lola in the machine]'' "'''ROCK-A-BYE BABIES IN A TREETOP. WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, THE CRADLE WILL ROCK. WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS, THE CRADLE WILL FALL. AND DOWN WILL COME BABY, CRADLE AND ALL.'''" ''[activates the machine]'' "'''3, 2, 1.'''"<br>
''[The five are sent into Lily's dream.]''
----
''[Leni turns on a flashlight, revealing that the five are inside the nightmare.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Welcome to Lily's dream." ''[takes out walkie-talkie]'' "Testing, testing. Bedroom team, do you read me? Over."<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[over walkie-talkie]'' "Roger that. Bedroom hears you loud and clear."<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Let's keep an eye out for any signs of Trashy or Tentacle."<br>
'''Leni:''' "Where are we?"<br>
'''Lynn:''' "Hey, check this out!" ''[finds an old football]'' "My old pigskin! Huh. We must be in our basement. Huh?"<br>
''[The football floats and converts into a nightmare pig, frightening Lynn. Lisa shoots the pig with her milk blaster, causing it to fall asleep, and blows the blaster.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Ah, yes. The basement. That would make sense. It's where every nightmare starts."<br>
''[Suddenly Lily is heard crying with a monster roaring backing her despairing cries.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "It sounds like Trashy found Lily! Hurry!"<br>
''[The five hurry upstairs to Lily's room.]''
----
''[In the real world, Lily tosses, turns, and moans as Lynn Sr., Luna, Luan, and Rita hear a lawnmower.]''<br>
'''Rita:''' "Who's mowing their lawn at 3 a.m.?"<br>
''[Luna and Rita peek out the window.]''<br>
'''Luna:''' "Looks like it's Grouse."<br>
'''Rita:''' ''[Takes out a mallet]'' "Ooh, I'll handle this."<br>
''[She heads outside; Lynn Sr., Luna, and Luan peek out the window.]''<br>
'''Mr. Grouse:''' ''[off-screen]'' "Hey, Loud, what are you do-" ''[Rita destroys his lawnmower]''<br>
'''Mr. Coconuts:''' "Wow. Sleepless Mom doesn't mess around!" ''[Rita is heard snoring]'' "And she fell asleep in the shrubs."
----
''[In the nightmare, Lincoln, Lisa, Lynn, Leni, and Lola approach Lily's room...]''<br>
'''Lynn:''' "Time to take out the trash."<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Lynn, wait. You've gotta be careful. If you're taken out in the nightmare, you get taken out in the real world."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "Come on, you keep adding rules." ''[Surprised]'' "And that's kind of a biggie."<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Get your night lights ready."<br>
''[The five siblings burst into Lily's room to see Lily cowering before Trashy, who roars.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Lily, fear not. We're here to cure your nightmares."<br>
''[Lily cheers. Lisa prepares to fight Trashy...]'' <br>
'''Leni:''' "Don't worry, Lily. I'll keep you company."<br>
''[...now joined by two of her siblings. Lincoln, Lisa, and Lynn prepare to fight Trashy.]''<br>
'''Lola:''' "You guys have this under control, right? Trash really isn't my thing." ''[Trashy takes out Lincoln, spraying trash on Lola's dress]'' "This is dry-clean only! '''''AAH!!!'''''"<br>
''[Trashy punches Lynn out of the way, but Lola tackles the beast and wrestles with it before punching it back to the trash. Lincoln puts the trash can upright and Lynn closes the lid.]''<br>
'''Lynn:''' "Now ''that's'' how you take out the trash!"<br>
'''Lisa:''' "One down, one to go."<br>
'''Lily:''' "Yay!" ''[claps her hands]''<br>
----
''[In the real world, Luan, Lana, Lucy, Luna, and Lynn Sr. are snoring when they hear a horn honking and engines revving. Lily still writhes in her sleep; Scoots and the Sunset Canyon crew are here to make noise. Scoots, Bernie and Seymour are having a drag race outside; Scoots starts doing donuts on the Louds' yard; Bernie honks his horn in the driveway; and Seymour knocks over the Louds' trashcans.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[Checks outside the window]'' "Oh no. It's Scoots and the Sunset Canyon crew."<br>
'''Lana:''' ''[Takes out a wrench]'' "Not for long!"<br>
''[The others check outside as Lana singlehandedly disables all the Sunset Canyon crew's vehicles off-screen.]''<br>
'''Luan:''' "Wow! Lana just took out the entire crew!"<br>
''[Lana falls asleep, too.]''<br>
'''Mr. Coconuts:''' "And she fell asleep in the shrubs."
----
''[In the nightmare, Lincoln, Lisa, Lily, Leni, Lynn, and Lola peek outside the door. Something is heard in the bathroom...]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "That must be Tentacle."<br>
''[The six approach the bathroom, but Tentacle grabs Lincoln and drags him inside the bathroom!]''<br>
'''Lola:''' ''[cheerfully]'' "Thanks for volunteering, Linky!"<br>
''[Tentacle starts dunking Lincoln in the toilet, slams him on the walls, and throws him outside the bathroom before retreating in the sink.]''<br>
'''Lynn:''' "Hey, look! If Tentacle is in the pipes, we just need to lure him to the toilet."<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Wait, take this." ''[hands Lincoln a teddy bear]'' "When you're in position, pull the string and drop it."<br>
'''Lola:''' "Oh, Linky, you're so brave!"<br>
''[She slaps him and pushes him back to the bathroom. He raps on the toilet, and Tentacle emerges. It swipes at Lincoln, and he hands the teddy bear to it, pulls the string, and lets go. Tentacle drags the bear inside the toilet, Lincoln flushes the toilet, and runs out of the bathroom before it explodes.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "You see, Lily? We defeated both of your monsters! There's nothing to be afraid of." ''[Lily whimpers and hides in Leni's backpack]'' "But your face says otherwise."<br>
''[Lily babbles fearfully.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "She said there's one more."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "A ''third'' monster?! Another thing Lisa failed to mention!" ''[Frowns and puts hands on hips.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Oh, don't look at me. There were only two in her finger painting."<br>
''[A crashing sound is heard, forcing the group to brace themselves.]''<br>
'''Lincoln, Leni and Lynn:''' "Whoa!"<br>
''[The third monster, a Flip monster, lifts up the roof of the nightmare Loud House.]''<br>
'''Flip Monster:''' "Hey, chiefs."<br>
''[The six Louds all panic and run as the Flip monster punches the floor. In the real world, Lily whimpers and moans more.]''<br>
----
''[Back in the nightmare, the six Louds burst out of the Loud House's door, but the Flip monster finds them and chases them to the backyard.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' ''[checks watch]'' "Gah! It's almost sunrise! We're running out of time!"<br>
''[The Flip monster sniffs the area, trying to find them.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Wait. This is just like the boss battle in my zombie video game!"<br>
'''Lola:''' "Oh? Was the boss a two-story convenience-store owner with nacho cheese breath?!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "No, but we can do this! If we blast it from different angles, it'll have no place to run and we can take it down!"<br>
'''Lynn:''' "I'm game!"<br>
'''Lola:''' "Whatever."<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Worth a shot!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "I'm in!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Everyone split up and get into position. ''I'll'' get his attention." ''[to the Flip monster]'' "Hey, Flip! Your nacho cheese is green! I want my money back!"<br>
'''Flip Monster:''' ''[turning to face hapless Lincoln]'' "Ah! No refunds!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Blast it! Now!"<br>
''[The Flip monster chases Lincoln. The others come out of hiding and shoot it with their milk blasters; he swallows it and gets sleepy.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[realizing a fatal error...]'' "Wait, isn't Flip lactose-intolerant? Run!"<br>
''[The Flip monster farts from its dual butt cracks, sending all six Louds flying to the bushes.]''<br>
'''Lynn:''' "I know it's a dream, but it smells so real!"<br>
'''Flip Monster:''' "Hey, where'd you go?"<br>
''[Lily whimpers.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "This monster's too powerful. We need to abort mission. It's too dangerous to stay here."<br>
'''Lynn:''' "If we leave, Lily's nightmares will be even worse!"<br>
'''Flip Monster:''' ''[finds them]'' "Eh, peek-a-boo, chiefs!"<br>
''[The Louds scream in terror while they're under a large shadow; they must retreat, and fast!]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Press your return buttons! NOW!!!"<br>
''[Lincoln, Leni, Lynn, and Lola press their return buttons and wake up in the real world, but find Lisa is still asleep.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Wait, why is Lisa still sleeping?"<br>
'''Lisa:''' ''[through the radio]'' "''Sorry, siblings. I already put one sister's life in danger.''"
----
''[Lisa is still in the nightmare realm.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "I can't risk any of yours." ''[goes to Charles' doghouse, where Lily is hiding.]'' "I must finish this alone. For Lily."<br>
''[Lily and Lisa smile at each other, but Lisa is grabbed by the Flip monster]''<br>
'''Lily:''' ''[distraught]'' "Lisa!"<br>
''[The Flip monster chuckles sinisterly as he squeezes Lisa's little body]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Lily, I'm sorry! I failed you!"<br>
''[Lily notices that Lisa had dropped her ca-Lynn-mari.]''<br>
'''Lily:''' ''[disgusted]'' "Blegh!" ''[takes it out of the bag and faces the Flip monster]'' "Bad Flip! Leave Lisa alone!"<br>
''[Lightning strikes the calamari, transforming it into a sword.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' ''[amazed]'' "A ca-Lynn-mari sword?!"<br>
''[Realizing what Lily will do, Lisa smirks at the Flip monster, who has a worrisome look. Lily readies her sword, yells, leaps into the air, and slashes the Flip monster before landing. It explodes, letting loose one last fart.]''
----
''[Later, Lisa awakens to a brief rain of ca-Lynn-mari chunks. The dream is now pink and bright, as opposed to the red and dark tones of the nightmare. Lily runs over and hugs her.]''<br>
'''Lily:''' "Lisa!"<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Lily, that was incredible! From now on, I promise; no more monster experiments."<br>
'''Lily:''' "Lily not afraid anymore!" ''[giggles]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' ''[chuckles]'' "Then my mission here is complete."<br>
'''Lily:''' "Bye-bye, Lisa!"<br>
'''Lisa:''' ''[kisses Lily]'' "Sweet dreams, Lily."<br>
''[Lisa uses her return button...]''
----
''[...and she wakes up in the real world.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Huh?"<br>
'''Lincoln, Leni, and Lynn:''' "You made it!"<br>
'''Lola:''' ''[hugs Leni]'' "I'm so glad you're okay!"<br>
'''Lynn:''' "What happened in there? Did you crush that thing?"<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Nope. ''She'' did."<br>
''[She points to Lily, now peacefully sleeping in her crib.]''
----
''[Later, at sunrise, Lily wakes up yawning to find Lynn Sr., Lucy, the Lull-a-bot, and Lisa sleeping. Upon noticing Lisa, Lily gasps, climbs out of her crib, and crawls on Lisa's bed.]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' ''[wakes up]'' "Huh?"<br>
'''Lily:''' "Lily has good dream about you."<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Pshaw. Tell me all about it, Lily."<br>
