''[The scene opens up on an exterior shot of the Loud House on a sunny day; Lincoln leaps out of his room to perform for the viewers.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Watch in awe, as The Amazing Lincoln displays his unbelievable yo-yo skills! I shall now "walk the dog"!"<br>''[Charles enters the scene, carrying a leash in his mouth.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Not you, Charles. I meant the yo-yo."<br>''[Charles whimpers, and he walks out of the scene; Lincoln does his "walk the dog" trick.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "I shall now go "AROUND THE WORLD"!"<br>''[Charles enters the scene, carrying a suitcase.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Sorry, still talking about the yo-yo."<br>''[Charles whimpers, and he walks out of the scene; Lincoln attempts to do the "around the world" trick, but the yo-yo flies off his finger, ricochets around the hallway, and flies into Lisa and Lily's room, causing a crash.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' ''[nervous]'' "The Amazing Lincoln will now take a brief intermission."<br>''[Lincoln and Charles look into the room, and they see that the bottles on Lisa's desk have been broken, with their contents spilled.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Yikes. I better go tell Lisa."<br>''[Cut to Lincoln's imagination, where Lisa observes the damage in a dark, stylized environment.]''<br>'''Imaginary Lisa:''' ''[turning red with anger, with her teeth sharpened.]'' '"You've completely ''DESTROYED'' MY LIFE'S WORK! I DESPISE YOU, AND YOU NO LONGER EXIST TO ME!"'<br>''[A wall of fire burns in the background behind her, along with a cultist choir. Back to reality.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Yeah, I'm not telling Lisa." ''[Charles whimpers]'' "Oh, come on, Charles. When did you get a conscience? I've seen you poop on the couch! Besides, if I just walk away, what's the worst thing that could happen?" ''[Charles glances at the viewers; Lincoln takes the yo-yo from the damage.]'' "I'll just remove the evidence, and they'll be none the wiser."<br>''[Lincoln and Charles walk out of the room; a drop of one chemical falls into a puddle of another chemical, causing an explosion that raises the roof.]''
----
''[Lisa is examining the damage on her desk.]''<br>'''Lisa:''' "I don't understand what went wrong. Science is a fickle mistress."<br>''[Lori is looking over a hole in the wall caused by the explosion, which leads to the closet in her's and Leni's room; Leni pokes her head through the hole.]''<br>'''Leni:''' "Hi, Lori! Have we always had a window in our closet?"<br>'''Lori:''' "Ugh, it's not a window. Lisa's experiment blew a hole in the wall." ''[notices a picture frame peeking out from the other side.]'' "What's this?" ''[Lori sees that the frame contains a signed photo of Bobby.]'' '''"To my bodacious babe"'''? Leni, why is this picture of Bobby hidden on ''your'' side of the closet?"<br>'''Leni:''' "Oh, there is it is! That was a surprise present from Bobby for your 88-day-iversary. He asked me to hide it for him, but I forgot where I put it."<br>'''Lori:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "That anniversary was ''eight days ago'', and Bobby gave me socks!" ''[Chucks the photo away in anger]'' "I can't believe this! You're literally seeing Bobby behind my back!" ''[Storms out]'' "You are no longer my sister!"<br>'''Lincoln:''' ''[walks into the room with a nervous smile]'' "Everything okay after that unexpected and totally random explosion that I know nothing about?"<br>''[Lori shouts in anger, marches out of the room, and slams the door; the vibrations causing a coat rack in the closet to fall onto Leni, knocking her out; a shelf also tips over, causing several pairs of shoes to fall on her.]''
----
''[Leni opens her eyes as she regains consciousness on Lisa's bed; Lincoln and Lisa are looking down on her.]''<br>'''Leni:''' "What happened?"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "A shelf fell on your head."<br>'''Leni:''' "Of course! Everyone knows that an object falling at a velocity of 9.8 meters per second squared will result in a temporary loss of consciousness."<br>'''Lisa:''' "I knew that. The question is, how did ''you?''"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Hey, I saw this in a movie once. I bet getting hit on the head altered Leni's brain and made her smart."<br>'''Lisa:''' "Lincoln, you seem unable to distinguish between scientific fact and preposterous Hollywood schlock."<br>'''Leni:''' "I don't get it."<br>'''Lisa:''' "See? Same old Leni." ''[Presses her cheek]'' "Can't even understand simple English."<br>'''Leni:''' ''[walks over to Lisa's chalkboard, which contains a complex equation.]'' "No, I don't get why you multiplied your "Z" polynomials before solving your non-negative integer exponents." ''[Lisa looks over the equation, and gasps loudly as it dawns on her that Leni is right.]'' "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to disprove Newtonian physics. Buh-bye!"<br>'''Lisa:''' ''[collapses to the floor, crestfallen]''" My world no longer makes sense."<br>''[Charles looks up and growls at Lincoln.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Don't you have a couch to poop on?"
----
''[The camera cuts to the Living room. Lincoln is cleaning up the mess on the couch.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Charles, that was a rhetorical question!"<br>''[Lynn enters the house in a outraged mood, screams loudly, and pounds her fist against the wall; she hyperventilates as Lincoln walks up to her.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "What are you so upset about?"<br>'''Lynn:''' "I just got kicked off all my sports teams because I'm failing school!"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "How could you fail? Doesn't Lisa tutor you?"<br>'''Lynn:''' "She ''used to'', until she dropped out and got a job as a gas station attendant at Flip's Food & Fuel."<br>'''Lincoln:''' "She WHAT?!"<br>'''Lynn:''' "Ugh! Without sports, my life is meaningless!" ''[kicks her soccer ball hard, forcing Lincoln to duck down and brace himself.]''<br>'''Lola:''' ''[walks down the stairs announcing]'' "I present to you your new "Miss Cute and--" ''[the ball hits her in the face]'' "OH, MY NOSE!"<br>''[Lola looks into a mirror, and sees that her nose has severely swollen up.]''<br>'''Lola:''' ''[gasps in despair]'' "I am a hideous...monster."<br>'''Lincoln:''' "It's not ''that'' bad, Lola."<br>'''Lola:''' "MY PAGEANT CAREER IS OVER!"<br>''[Lola runs up the stairs, and she trips and falls on her face when she reaches the top.]''<br>'''Lola:''' "OH, MY TEETH!" ''[sobs]''<br>''[Lincoln tries to control his feelings. Charles looks up at Lincoln, and he shakes his head in disapproval. Lincoln grumpily stares back at him, and then becomes regretful.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Fine, I'll fix it."
----
''[Lincoln rides his bike over to Flip's Food & Fuel. He sees Lisa wearing a gas station attendant's uniform.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Lisa, why are you doing this?"<br>'''Lisa:''' "Flip's the only guy who will hire four-year-olds with no experience."<br>'''Lincoln:''' "No, I mean, why are you doing ''any'' of this? Come home. Lynn needs you!"<br>'''Lisa:''' "Why don't you get Miss Smarty-Pants to help her!" ''[Leni drives up in a pink convertible.]'' "Speak of the Devil. Regular or unleaded?<br>'''Leni:''' ''[brandishes a certificate]'' "Oh, I don't need gas. I just won the Nobel Prize for inventing a car that runs on apple juice."<br>'''Lisa:''' ''[Apathetic]'' "Of course you did."<br>'''Leni:''' ''[hands Lisa a juice box]'' "Fill 'er up, please!"<br>''[Lisa opens up the fuel tank, and squirts the carton's contents into it.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "And then we'll all get in Leni's juice-mobile, go home, and forget all this nonsense."<br>'''Leni:''' "Can't! I'm off to Harvard! Au revoir, adios, auf Wiedersehen, and aloha!"<br>'''Lisa:''' "A-HA! "Aloha" means "Hello"!"<br>'''Leni:''' "It also means "Goodbye"!" ''[speeds off, leaving Lincoln and Lisa alone.]''<br>'''Lisa:''' "Dang it. I ''used'' to know that."<br>''[Flip, the owner of the station, opens a window and calls out to Lisa.]''<br>'''Flip:''' "Hey, Chatty Cathy, BACK TO WORK!"<br>''[the station's payphone rings; Lincoln answers it, and he hears barking on the other end.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Hello? Charles? She's WHAT?! Alright, I'm on my way!"
----
''[Lincoln enters Lola's room, holding an ice pack.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Look who it is, Miss Soon-to-heal."<br>''[Lola, who is trying to stuff a bunch of clothes into a suitcase, turns to Lincoln; she still has her swollen nose, and all but one of her teeth are gone.]''<br>'''Lola:''' "WHAT DO ''YOU'' WANT?"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "AAAAAHHH! I mean, you're looking better!"<br>'''Lola:''' ''[with a lisp]'' "Oh, nice try, Lincoln, but I am ''out of ''here! I can't stay where I'm... CONSTANTLY REMINDED OF MY FORMER SELF!" ''[looks up, sadly, at old photos of herself.]'' "My beautiful, beautiful self."<br>'''Lincoln:''' "But...But..."<br>''[Lola struggles to pull her stuffed suitcase, and the handle breaks off, causing her to fall on her face and black both her eyes.]''<br>'''Lola:''' ''[Fiercely]'' "I'll ''send'' for this!" ''[grabs the ice pack, puts it over her eyes, and walks out into the hallway.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Lola, wait!"<br>''[Lincoln tries to run for her, but he bumps into a plastic bubble containing Lana.]''<br>'''Lana:''' "Careful, Lincoln! You could get seriously injured!"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Lana, what are you doing in there?"<br>'''Lana:''' "I saw what happened to Lola. Life is a fragile thing. I don't want to take any risks."<br>'''Lincoln:''' "But you're the ''queen'' of risks!"<br>'''Lana:''' "''Was'' the queen of risks! From now on, I'll stay in here, where it's safe! You know what I'm talkin' about, huh, Geo?"<br>''[Geo rolls by in his hamster ball.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Lana, you can't be serious!" ''[Lana rolls past him]'' "Lana?!"<br>''[Lincoln suddenly hears Luna singing.]''<br>'''Luna:''' ''[singing]'' "Things have gotten drastic / Now, my sister lives in plastic / Where did it all go wrong?"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Luna?"<br>'''Luna:''' ''[shows Lincoln a laptop]'' "Check it, bro. I uploaded a song I wrote about our family going down the Highway to--HELLO! I just got fifty more hits!"<br>''[The ceiling breaks open, and Mick Swagger descends, holding into a rope ladder from a helicopter.]''<br>'''Luna:''' ''[gasps]'' "Mick Swagger?!"<br>'''Mick:''' "Your singing is amazing! You gotta join my tour!" ''[holds Luna's hand]''<br>'''Luna:''' "Luna is IN!"<br>''[the rope goes up though the hole in the ceiling, carrying both away.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' ''[Bawling]'' "Don't you leave, too! THE FAMILY'S FALLING APART!"<br>'''Luna:''' ''[from the helicopter]'' "SORRY, DUDE!"<br>''[the helicopter flies away]''
----
''[Lincoln goes into his room, and he decides to contact Clyde with his walkie-talkie.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Clyde, this is Lincoln! Come in! I've got a Code Blue!"<br>''[the screen splits in half to show Clyde's location.]''<br>'''Clyde:''' "Code Blue?! You did something wrong and lied about it, and now everything is all messed up?!"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Affirmative! Can you come over?!"<br>'''Clyde:''' "Negative. I've got a Code Green!"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "You showed up to school in your underwear?"<br>'''Clyde:''' "No, that's Code Orange. Hang on."<br>''[Clyde's is revealed to be skydiving with Lori, and he takes a picture of them with his camera phone; Lincoln gets the picture via text message on his phone, and he jumps up in surprise.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "SWEET MOTHER OF...What are you doing with ''Lori?!''"<br>'''Clyde:''' "I've been trying to tell you! A Code Green; Lori broke up with Bobby, and I'm the rebound guy!"<br>'''Lori:''' "Happy eight-minute-iversary, Snookie-Booboo-Sugarbear."<br>''[Clyde leans in for a kiss, but Lori deploys her parachute, causing Clyde to kiss a flying bird instead.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' ''[gags and throws away the walkie-talkie.]'' "WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MY FAMILY?!"<br>''[Luan shows up, solemn and depressed, and knocks on Lincoln's door.]''<br>'''Luan:''' "Knock-knock."<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Who's there?"<br>'''Luan:''' ''[Miserably]'' "This is not a joke, Lincoln. Do you know what's going on in the world? Here, take Mr. Coconuts. He just reminds me of all the trees being cut down in the rainforest." ''[Lincoln holds Mr. Coconuts while Luan walks away.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Wait, Luan..." ''[She stops]'' "What brought this on?"<br>'''Luan:''' "Well, ever since Luna left, I've had no one to try my jokes out on. So, I've been watching a lot of cable news, and what I've seen is horrific. So, I've decided to become..." ''[Angrily clenches her fist]'' "AN ACTIVIST!"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Don't be ridiculous! You're a comedian!" ''[takes out a pie and throws it into his face.]'' "See? Funny, right?"<br>''[Lincoln yelps - releasing the pie mess and Mr. Coconuts - and ducks down as a horde of wild animals stampedes past him.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "What the heck was that?!"<br>'''Luan:''' "They're just Lana's pets. I liberated them. And now, I'm off to heal this ticking time bomb we call Earth."<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Wait, Luan, you can't be serious!"<br>''[a monkey appears, spooking Lincoln, and it takes Mr. Coconuts.]''
----
''[The monkey and a big snake are in the living room; Lincoln chases Izzy, who hides under the couch.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Get back here, Izzy!"<br>''[the snake hisses at him, and hides behind the couch.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Izzy, come to Uncle Lincoln!"<br>'''News Reporter:''' ''[on the TV]'' "And now, for tonight's top stories. Former rising star Luna Loud was kicked off the Mick Swagger tour, for destroying a hotel room."<br>''[the news cut to footage of Luna screaming amidst the wreckage of her hotel room.]''<br>'''Luna:''' ''[in a British accent]'' "ALL I WANTED WAS A BLEEDING ''PILLOW MINT!''"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Luna?"<br>'''Reporter:''' "In a related story, former comedian turned activist Luan Loud has chained herself to a giant redwood."<br>''[the news cuts to footage of Luan chained to a giant redwood, while onlookers record her with their mobile devices.]''<br>'''Luan:''' ''[chanting]'' "Hey-hey, ho-ho! Keep your hands off, let it grow!"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Luan?!"<br>''[Izzy, the snake, and the monkey join him in viewing.]''<br>'''Reporter:''' "I'm being told we have breaking news."<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Please don't be one of my sisters!"<br>''[the news cuts to Katherine Mulligan on the scene at Flip's Food & Fuel, with Lisa drinking a "Flippee" ice drink right next to her.]''<br>'''Katherine:''' "Tucker, I'm here at Flip's Food & Fuel, where two unknown bandits have just made off with a carload of beef jerky and a cotton candy machine!"<br>'''Lisa:''' "They're not unknown, they're my sisters." ''[sips]'' "Their betrayal hurts more than this brain freeze."<br>'''Katherine:''' "I'm getting word that the bandits are currently leading police on a slow-speed chase!"<br>''[cuts to an army of police cars chasing Lola's kiddie car through the desert; Lola, her face now covered in bandages, is driving, while Lynn is in the passenger seat, eating cotton candy.]''<br>''[Lincoln and the animals look on in shock; Izzy, Lincoln, and the monkey take on the familiar "wise monkey" poses.]''<br>'''Lincoln''' ''[Anguished]'' "WHERE DID IT ALL GO WROOOONG?!"<br>'''Katherine:''' "One has to wonder, where did it all go wrong for these girls? And why is a four-year-old working at a gas station?"<br>''[Flip takes hold of the camera.]''<br>'''Flip:''' "Interview over! Wait, don't forget to come down to Flip's Food & Fuel, home of the Flippee! ''Now'' the interview's over." ''[puts his hand over the camera.]''<br>''[Lincoln turns off the TV with the remote; Lucy suddenly appears next to him.]''<br>'''Lucy:''' "I was watching that."<br>'''Lincoln:''' ''[screams and jumps up in terror, letting go of the remote.]'' "Lucy! At least ''you're'' still normal!"<br>''[Lucy looks toward Lincoln, and smiles wide to reveal a pair of vampiric fangs as she hisses.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "D'AAH! NOT NORMAL!"<br>'''Lucy:''' "I was bitten by Lana's liberated vampire bat. Greatest! Day! EVER!" ''[turns into a bat and flies away.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Nine sisters lost, but there's still ''one'' I can save!"
----
''[Lincoln enters Lisa and Lily's room, and he looks into Lily's crib; he finds that she is not in it.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Lily?"<br>''[the roof is lifted up from outside by Lily, who has grown to gargantuan size; she looks down at Lincoln, and she giggles with a deep voice.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "LILY!"<br>''[Lincoln sees a trail of Lisa's chemicals leading from her desk to the crib.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "Oh no, Lisa's chemicals! What have I done?!"<br>'''Lily:''' "Mmmm... yum yum!"<br>''[Lily reaches down for Lincoln as he tries to run away; he gets caught, and Lily opens her mouth.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "DON'T EAT ME, LILY!"<br>''[Lincoln screams as Lily lifts him toward her mouth; his open mouth fills the camera, turning the screen black.]''
----
''[the screen flashes back to the point where Lincoln and Charles were overlooking the damage on Lisa's desk.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "So ''that's'' the worst thing that could happen." ''[Charles barks]'' "I totally agree! I'm going to tell Lisa!"<br>'''Lisa:''' ''[in the doorway]'' "Tell Lisa what?" ''[gasps as she sees the damage.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' ''[quickly while fearful]'' "I was playing with my yo-yo, and it got out of control, and it wrecked your experiment, and I'm really, really sorry! Go ahead and disown me, 'cause I deserve it!"<br>''[Lisa smiles, and hugs Lincoln.]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' "I'm confused. You're not mad?"<br>'''Lisa:''' "Mad? I'm ecstatic! You proved my hypothesis! Your recklessness was the one variable my rigidly-controlled experiment sorely needed!"<br>'''Lincoln:''' "I'm still confused."<br>'''Lisa:''' "I'm saying thank you for being a clumsy doofus. And thanks for admitting what you did."<br>'''Lincoln:'''  "I didn't have a choice. ''[Increasingly fearful]'' I didn't want ''you'' to work at a gas station, or Lynn and Lola to turn to a life of crime, or Lana to live in a bubble, or...or...or..."<br>'''Lisa:''' "Fascinating. Exposure to my chemicals seems to have damaged his cerebral cortex." ''[Walks away]''<br>'''Lincoln:''' ''[sighs; speaks to the viewers]'' "Boy, am I glad ''that'' nightmare's over."<br>''[Lincoln hears a bicycle bell ringing from outside; he looks out and sees Lori, and Clyde riding a tandem bike, which is dragging a string of cans and a sign reading "JUST MARRIED"; the sight of this causes Lincoln to scream in horror.]''
