''[Gus' Games & Grub. Lincoln and his friends are depicted in a framed picture; pan back to reveal they are sitting on the very chair depicted in the picture]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' ''[Sighs]'' "Gus' Games & Grub, you never disappoint." ''[He and his friends are inside, making a toast]'' "After a long week of sixth grade, there's nowhere I'd rather throw back a few cold glasses of water." ''[Clyde drinks his water and sighs again]'' "That's good tap."<br>
''[His friends drink their water and sigh too. Gus comes out of the kitchen]''<br>
'''Gus:''' "One spaghetti pizza for my favorite customers." ''[Places it on the gang's table. They like what they see]''<br>
'''Sixth graders:''' "Mmm..."<br>
'''Gus:''' "I only make this for my most regular regulars. Speaking of... Stella," ''[Takes out a pizza paddle, with a blue hoodie on the end]'' "I found your hoodie, washed it then dried it in the pizza oven."<br>
''[Stella puts her hoodie on]''<br>
'''Stella:''' "Ooh, pizza pressed." ''[Finds something in the right sleeve; interested.]'' "Hey, there's a pepperoni in my sleeve." ''[Eats it]'' "Mmm..."<br>
'''Gus:''' "Liam, we got your special seat cushion right here."<br>
''[A waitress wheels up a bail of hay. Liam sits on it]''<br>
'''Liam:''' ''[Satisfied]'' "Nothin' better on your behind than a bale of hay."<br>
'''Gus:''' ''[To Rusty]'' "And Rust-Man, heard the good news about your report card." ''[Reaches into his pocket]'' "As promised, here's a game token, for every A."<br>
'''Rusty:''' "Yes!" ''[Twirls the token in the air and catches it]'' "Thank you, wood shop!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "And thank ''you'', Gus, for making us feel like family."<br>
'''Gus:''' "You're welcome, kids. Enjoy that pizza."<br>
''[Gus takes off. Suddenly the bell at the front door rings]''<br>
'''Stella:''' "Oh, Lincoln, isn't that your sister?"<br>
''[Turns out, Leni and her friends have shown up.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Notices her brother]'' "Hey, Lincoln." ''[She and her friends approach Lincoln and his friends.]'' "It's, like, totes packed in here. Mind if we share your booth?"<br>
''[Miguel kicks the bail of hay, forcing Liam to sit with his friends in the booth again.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Well, it's already-" ''[Leni's friends squeeze into the booth.]'' "Full."<br>
'''Mandee:''' ''[Gasps]'' "Is that spaghetti pizza?"<br>
'''Jackie:''' "Yuuuum!"<br>
'''Miguel:''' "I'm starving!"<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Oh, can I have a slice?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Oh. Well, I guess." ''[The teens devour the entire pizza.]'' "So, what are you guys doing here?"<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Yeah, don't you guys usually hang out at the mall?"<br>
'''Jackie:''' "Usually." ''[Takes another bite]'' "But Dim Yum is closed."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Yeah, but the skee-ball is open! Come on, let's play some games!"<br>
'''Jackie:''' "Yay!"<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Aww, yeah!"
''[The teens leave the booth, plonking Lincoln and his friends back in their seats.]''<br>
'''Zach:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "They ate all of our pizza. Now they're playing all of our games?"<br>
''[Camera cuts to Leni and her friends taking over the arcade and gaming.]''<br>
'''Liam:''' "Y'all, they're takin' over this place like skeeters on a sugar sucker!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Guys, it's OK- it's only for an afternoon. We can still have fun..."<br>
''[Miguel lands a high score at skee-ball. He and his friends celebrate while a long sheet of tickets feed out; Rusty and his friends approach.]''<br>
'''Rusty:''' "Mind if I get next? I don't get A's very often."<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Sorry, dude. Miguel's gonna be here for a while; he's on a roll."<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!"<br>
'''Jackie:''' ''[Excitedly]'' "Only 10,000 more tickets, and he has enough to win the Rip Hardcore Waffle Iron!"<br>
'''Teens:''' ''[Singing]'' "Waff-les!"<br>
'''Clyde:''' "I've been saving up my tickets for ''years'' trying to win that." ''[sulks]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Sorry, Clyde." ''[Gus passes by]'' "Maybe this will make you feel better. ''[He chases after Gus.]'' 'Scuse me, Gus, Clyde here needs a garlic knot pick-me-up."<br>
'''Gus:''' "Ah, sorry, Lincoln. I just served up my last order."<br>
''[Said last order is being eaten by the teens.]''
----
''[Later, Miguel has won the Rip Hardcore Waffle Iron. He smooches and nuzzles his prize. The camera zooms out, revealing the furious sixth graders sat in the booth.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "OMGosh, this was totes fun. This place is great! Who knew?"<br>
''[Leni and her friends leave.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Annoyed]'' "We did." ''[Normally]'' "Anyways, thanks for coming. Have fun at Dim Yum tomorrow!" ''[Waves goodbye.]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' ''[Stops]'' "Oooh, sorry, we weren't clear before. We meant Dim Yum is closed... ''forever''."<br>
''[The kids gasp in horror. Rusty stops sipping his drink and starts coughing.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "See you guys tomorrow!"<br>
'''Miguel:''' ''[Condescending]'' "And you better believe your boy's getting his hands on the rest of that Rip Hardcore kitchenware line."<br>
''[The teens leave]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Determined]'' "Don't worry, guys. I'll make them see that this is ''our'' hangout. I'll be friendly but persuasive, charming but mature, casual but firm."
----
''[Cut to Lincoln begging on his knees in front of Leni]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Please, please, please, please, pleeeeease!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "I'm really sorry, Lincoln, but Gus's is the only hangout that works for ''all'' of my friends."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Seriously? There's nowhere else? What about the Burpin' Burger?"<br>
'''Miguel:''' "How dare you?! I'm recently vegetarian."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "OK, what about the Burnt Bean?"<br>
'''Jackie:''' "I don't ''do'' hot liquids."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Well, what about the-"<br>
'''Fiona:''' ''[shushes Lincoln]'' "Ah, ah, ah! We could do this all day, but we're not going to. See you tomorrow."<br>
''[The teens leave. Leni shrugs at Lincoln sheepishly before joining her friends. He glares.]''
----
''[Lunchtime at Royal Woods Middle School]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Determined]'' "We cannot sit by while our hangout is taken over by garlic knot-loving teenagers. We need to reclaim Gus's, our beloved home away from home. Because they may take our waffle irons, but they will not! Take! Our! FREEDOM!"<br>
''[The camera zooms out, revealing that he's making a speech while standing on the lunch table and Rusty's sandwich. Some other kids walk by and stare at him.]''<br>
'''Rusty:''' "Could you get your foot off my sandwich?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Oops." ''[Steps off the sandwich, patches it up, and gives it to Rusty.]'' "Sorry."<br>
''[Rusty takes a bite of his sandwich.]''<br>
'''Stella:''' "Uh, Lincoln, super inspirational speech and all, but how do we get rid of Leni and her friends?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Do you think I would have stomped on Rusty's lunch if I didn't have a plan?"
----
''[Back at Gus', Zach and Stella - wearing hard hats - are putting up caution tape around the game area]''<br>
'''Zach:''' "That oughta do it. Now all the games look off limits."<br>
''[The bell goes off. Stella gasps, and she and Zach hide. Leni and her friends approach the tape.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Excitedly]'' "OMGosh! An arcade just for VIPs!"<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Girl, I only do VIP."<br>
''[He lifts the tape and they all enter and get gaming. Lincoln and his friends are watching, slap their faces and groan.]''
----
''[Later, Lincoln is putting Clyde in a waiter's outfit.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Time for plan B. Clyde, you're up."<br>
'''Clyde:''' ''[Anxious]'' "They're gonna know it's me."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "That's what the disguise is for." ''[Puts a menu over Clyde's face]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Now I'm nervous, ''and'' I can't see."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Ushers Clyde forward]'' "Go get 'em, buddy."<br>
''[At the booth, where Lincoln and his friends usually sit, Leni and her friends are chatting away. Clyde approaches them]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Not recognizing Clyde]'' "Do you have any special pizzas today?"<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Uh, no. Actually we don't have any pizza at all, or pasta, or food."<br>
''[Leni and her friends - all believing this - talk to each other while disappointed.]''<br>
'''Mandee:''' "Guess we should go, guys."<br>
'''Gus:''' ''[Runs up to them with a platter]'' "Hey gang, the Royal Woods Men's Choir ordered this Gus buster, but they got called away on a singing emergency. You want?"<br>
''[Gus gives them the buster and they cheer. Clyde's friends groan and pass out into a pile.]''
----
''[Next, they are at the ice bar]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Time for Plan C: Gus' famous ice bar."<br>
'''Rusty:''' "Which ice we going with? Cubed? Shaved? Flaked? Still? Sparkling? Diet?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Nope." ''[Takes Rusty to the ice they are going with. He takes a scoop.]'' "Pebbled. Leni hates it. She says it's like chewing baby rocks. Liam, think you can get these into her cup from over here?"<br>
'''Liam:''' "You're darn tootin' I can."<br>
''[Lincoln puts a scoop of pebbled ice into Liam's hand. The Cow Pie Kid winds up his shot and gets in Leni's water. Leni doesn't even notice and drinks]''<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Shrieks]'' "Ew, ugh, baby rocks! Ugh!"<br>
''[Disgusted, puts the drink down. Gus is alerted and runs to her.]''<br>
'''Gus:''' "Ma'am, what's wrong?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "It's that awful ice! I can still feel it in my mouth and it's stressing me out."<br>
'''Gus:''' "Then Gus' shall provide a way to relax." ''[Claps his hands and a waitress brings a massage chair and lets Leni sit.]'' "Get comfortable; you're gonna be here for a while."<br>
''[Turns it on and Leni relaxes. Lincoln can't take it anymore.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Angrily]'' "Gaaaah! That's it!" ''[He and his friends march over to their booth; Demanding.]'' "Leni, we're done with you hanging out here!" [His friends join in]<br>
'''Liam:''' "Yeah! Now get! Don't make us hunk more ice at y'all."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Still on the massage chair shaking.]'' "The baby rocks was you? Not cool, Lincoln."<br>
'''Fiona''' ''[Getting annoyed]'' "Yeah, if you're gonna pull dirty tricks, there's no way we're leaving."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Then there's only one way to settle this... We'll have a competition to see who gets to call Gus' their hangout. Losers are banned ''forever''."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Still on the massage chair shaking.]'' "Let's do it."<br>
''[The siblings shake on it, causing Lincoln to vibrate along with it.]''
----
''[Later, the competition is starting]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Gus' Game-a-thon. Here's how this works. We compete in a series of challenges. The group with the most Gus points wins." ''[A waitress - wearing a welding mask - arrives with a tray of hot wings]'' "'''ROUND ONE'''. Whoever eats the most hot wings gets a Gus point. You and me, Leni. Go!"<br>
''[Lincoln takes a bite out of a hot wing; his face glows red. Leni takes another, and her face also glows red immediately. The siblings keep eating hot wings, glare angrily at each other, and eat another wing. It's too much for Leni.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "I'm sorry; I just can't!"<br>
''[She throws the wing at Gus's eye, knocking him out and causing him to drop the tray of food.]''<br>
'''Gus:''' "Ah! Hot sauce in my eyes!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[downs a cup of water]'' "That's the end of Round One. It's Team Lincoln, one, Team Leni, zero." ''[Gus dumps his steaming head in the ice booth. The other customers look at him confused.]'' "'''ROUND TWO'''." ''[Clyde and Miguel get into a flight simulator.]'' "Whoever crosses the finish line first gets a Gus point. On your marks, get set, go!"<br>
'''Rusty:''' "You aren't gonna win if you don't speed it up."<br>
'''Clyde:''' "The skies are not a playground, Rusty."<br>
'''Fiona:''' "How is Clyde beating you?"<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Flying is hard. Plus, I'm afraid of heights."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[To Fiona]'' "Don't worry, I got this." ''[Whispers to Miguel]'' "There's a fashion show in Paris that you totes don't wanna miss."<br>
''[Miguel gets his game face on and takes to the skies, scoring points and crossing the finish line quickly. Team Lincoln is horrified]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "Yeah!"<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[does a victory dance.]'' "Ooh, ooh! One Gus point for Team Leni!"<br>
''[Clyde throws his helmet to the ground in anger. Gus accidentally steps on it and slips, causing him to scream and fall over.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "'''ROUND THREE''': The claw game. Grab a prize, get a Gus point."<br>
''[Mandee tries the claw game and tries to get a star, but it slips from the claw. Team Lincoln can only watch Mandee in amusement.]''<br>
'''Mandee:''' ''[Scoffs and becomes annoyed]'' "This thing is broken!"<br>
''[Liam tries his hand at the claw and succeeds in getting a toy copter.]''<br>
'''Liam:''' "Told ya I was good at hoisting. I've been forklifting on the farm since before I could make like a hawk." ''[lets the copter fly]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Gus point for Team Lincoln! The score is two to one."<br>
''[The copter chases Gus, grabs him, and rams him into the claw game.]''<br>
'''ROUND FOUR'''<br>
''[Rusty and Jackie attempt to make a pizza, but Rusty accidentally throws his dough on the ceiling while Jackie pours toppings and puts it in the oven with Fiona's help.]''<br>
'''Jackie:''' "Ha!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[To the viewers]'' "Two to two."<br>
''[Team Lincoln and Team Leni leave; Gus is hit with Rusty's dough and drops all the plates.]''<br>
'''ROUND 5'''<br>
''[Fiona plays skee-ball with great concentration. She manages to land the balls in the 30, 20, and 10 holes, scoring 500 points.]''<br>
'''Fiona:''' "Yes!"<br>
''[It's Stella's turn. She throws the balls without looking and they all land in the 100 hole. She gets a perfect 99999 points, and Team Lincoln celebrates]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Three to two!"<br>
''[Gus gets a letter and gets a paper cut. He sucks his injured finger.]''<br>
'''Gus:''' "This is really not my day."<br>
'''ROUND SIX'''<br>
''[Zach is playing Smack-a-Troll and misses several trolls; one of the trolls hits him, and he lies on the floor dazed. Miguel approaches the game with headphones and hits the trolls to the beat of his music, much to Team Lincoln's horror. He gets a perfect score.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Three to three."<br>
''[Team Leni cheers and hoists Miguel on their arms. Gus trips on a wire and falls into the game, getting hit by the trolls.]''<br>
'''ROUND SEVEN'''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "The score is tied as we go into the final round: Dance Battle!"<br>
''[The dance-off begins with Rusty versus Mandee, followed by Fiona and Zach, and then Liam and Miguel slow-dancing together, with Liam even dipping Miguel. Lincoln and Leni are the last ones up, dancing on par with each other.]''<br>
'''Gus:''' ''[Approaches]'' "Whoa, this is really heating up." ''[The machine starts smoking. Gus comes up to the siblings, becoming worried]'' "No, I'm serious. You need to stop! My machine is about to break!"<br>
'''Leni:''' "But we don't have a winner yet!"<br>
''[The machine sparks and starts breaking down]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Keep dancing, everyone!"<br>
''[Team Lincoln and Team Leni all hit the dance floor and start dancing. Miguel boots Liam off, Jackie spins into Clyde, knocking them both over. Suddenly, the two groups are annoyed with each other and start having a smackdown right there. The crowd clamour and make a run for it as the fight leaves the dance floor and rages all over the arcade.]''<br>
'''Gus:''' "Come on, guys!"<br>
''[The friends don't listen and keep fighting, demolishing the arcade in the process, and knocking over the ice statue at the bar. They even trample Gus. The fight finally ends back at the booth, both groups are exhausted]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Is it over? Did we win?"<br>
''[Leni and Lincoln look and gasp. They see all the damage they did to the place and they see two employees carrying Gus out on a stretcher]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Sighs]'' "I think we ''all'' lost."<br>
''[The two siblings sigh]''
----
''[Outside on the curb, everyone is bummed out]''<br>
'''Miguel:''' "You know what the worst part is?"<br>
'''Zach:''' ''[Pulls a splinter out]'' "All the splinters in my butt?"<br>
'''Miguel:''' "I'm still so hungry." ''[Starts sobbing]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[Consoling]'' "Leni, I'm sorry."<br>
'''Leni:''' ''[Consoling]'' "I'm sorry, too. We shouldn't have just barged in and taken over. Gus' was your place first."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Thanks, but I shouldn't have made such a big deal about you guys sharing it. Now, ''none'' of us have a place to hang out."<br>
'''Gus:''' ''[Limps up to them with a crutch and a cast on his leg; Furious]'' "Oh, don't you worry. I know how ''all'' of you can still hang out here."
----
''[Later, the kids are picking up damaged game parts off the floor. Stella sweeps the small parts. The teens put everything into the trash and Fiona takes it out. Someone paints over all the splatters on the wall. And it all ends with Lincoln cleaning their favorite table.]''<br>
'''Leni:''' "Guys look, the booth is done."<br>
'''Stella:''' "But who gets to sit in it?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "All of us. Check this out."<br>
''[Presses a button under the table and the whole booth and table expand outward. Everyone is impressed as the two groups all sit together]''<br>
'''Liam:''' "Hoo-wee. It's roomier than a barn after-"<br>
''[Suddenly, Lincoln and Leni's seats spring them up. The siblings find themselves clinging to the ceiling fan, screaming constantly.]''<br>
'''Clyde:''' "Guess the seats still need work."<br>
'''Gus:''' ''[Approaches them all. Happy]'' "Wow, this place looks great. Who wants a spaghetti pizza?"<br>
''[The fan propels the siblings towards the exit]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Thanks Gus, can we get ours to ''go''..."<br>
''[The two Louds fly right out the door.]''
