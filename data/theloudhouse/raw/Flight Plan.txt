''[Morning at the Casagrande's. Carlitos is holding his madre's eyes closed]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Okay, mi amore, open." ''[Frida opens her eyes, her hijos and hija are holding roses, and her esposo has something for her]'' "Happy anniversary, Frida."<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Gasps]'' "Carlos, you made a portrait of me out of breakfast?"<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Oh well, the kids helped too."<br>
'''Frida:''' "I love it so much." ''[Cries]'' "How beautiful mis amores, and delicious. Thank you, Carlos. And here's your gift."<br>
''[Hands Carlos a brochure]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "You got me a trip to fly on a vintage World War II aircraft?" ''[Gasps]'' "On the P-40 Warhawk, no less."<br>
''[Jumps into his esposa's arms]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "That's a great gift."<br>
''[The boys start playing planes]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "So when are we going?"<br>
'''Frida:''' "I'm sorry but the ride is only for your father and me."<br>
''[The boys stop what they're doing]''<br>
'''Carl & CJ:''' "What?"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Then what are we gonna do all day?"
----
''[A little later]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Mr. Nakamura, thank you so much for watching the boys on such short notice. The whole family was busy today so we really appreciate it."<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' "It's our pleasure. Isn't it Nelson?"<br>
''[Nelson barks]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Be good for Mr. Nakamura, boys."<br>
''[Frida leaves]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Very excited]'' "P-40 Warhawk, here I come!"
''[Carlos takes off. The boys are hiding behind the recliner. Carlitos mutters something]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Yeah I know bro, I wanted to go on that plane too. But we're stuck with Mr. Nakamura and Nelson." ''[Carlitos gets an idea and mutters]'' "You little genius, that's a great idea. We'll drive Mr. Nakamura away and Mom and Dad will have to take us on the plane."<br>
''[The boys laugh diabolically]''<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' "Oh boys look what I brought, my collection of antique toys. Aren't they magnificent? Nelson brought some of his, too." ''[Nelson shows his. The boys are amazed and attempt to touch]'' "No, no no. These are for you to look at, not to play with, they are more valuable inside the box."<br>
'''Carl:''' "I think I know how to get rid of this guy." ''[To Mr. Nakamura]'' "Mr. Nakamura, can you please make us some popcorn?"<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' "Oh, sure. My favorite vintage snack."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Snickers]'' "It's play time."<br>
''[Mr. Nakamura brings in the popcorn]''<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' "Popcorn's ready." ''[Sees what the boys are doing]'' "For the love of all things antique!"<br>
''[Carlitos is chewing on Nelson's toy, and Carl and CJ are playing tug of war with one of Mr' Nakamura's]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Is this one of those stretchy toys?" ''[They rip the arm off]'' "Whoopsie."<br>
''[Mr. Nakamura faints]''
----
''[At the GLART station, Carlos & Frida's train pulls up]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "Happy anniversary! I heard you're gonna see some rickety old airplane. Boring! Trains are so much cooler."<br>
''[Frida gets a call]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Hi Mr. Nakamura. What? Toy-pacalypse?" ''[Mr. Nakamura says more stuff and hangs up]'' "Aye, sorry Mr. Chang, you better go on without us." ''[Takes Carlos back]'' "We need a new babysitter."<br>
'''Stanley:''' "I bet trains could babysit better than airplanes." ''[Gets squished between the doors]'' "Not again."
----
''Later, Miranda is at the apartment]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Thank you so much for coming last minute Miranda."<br>
'''Miranda:''' "Oh, it's no trouble at all. We're gonna have fun watching a movie, as long as it's not a scary movie I just can't handle those."<br>
''[The boys have heard that, and start snickering, diabolically. Moments later, Miranda is watching a romantic comedy, and the boys are watching her]''<br>
'''Rom-Com Actor:''' "Why can't you see that I love you, silly girl?"<br>
'''Miranda:''' "Gosh, I love this movie." ''[Suddenly, the TV goes fuzzy and lightning sounds. Miranda gasps]'' "What was that?"<br>
''[Carl jumps forward]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Oh no! Not again! I'm changing!"<br>
''[Carl starts shaking. He rips his shirt off, revealing a gorilla chest, and starts howling. Miranda freaks out]''<br>
'''Miranda:''' "Aah! Werewolf!"<br>
''[Miranda hears mumbling from above; she looks and sees Carlitos crawling on the ceiling, drooling creepily. She freaks out again. She turns and CJ is right behind her]''<br>
'''CJ:''' ''[Turns to face Miranda]'' "Here's… CJ!"<br>
''[Shines a flashlight under his chin. Miranda gets so scared she runs back to her apartment. CJ turns the lights back to normal, catches Carlitos, who was wearing suction cups on his hands and feet]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Takes the fake chest off]'' "P-40 Warhawk, here we come."
----
''[Somewhere else, the GLART stops and Frida and Carlos push the doors open themselves to get away from Stanley]''<br>
'''Stanley:''' "..and reason number seventy-eight why trains are better than planes."<br>
'''Everyone else on the train:''' "Enough already."<br>
''[The GLART takes off]''<br>
'''Carlos & Frida:''' "Phew."<br>
''[Frida gets a call]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "Oh no, what now? Hi Miranda. What? Monsters? I know they can get rowdy but… Yes I understand."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "She quit, didn't she?"<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Determined]'' "That's it! It's time for some serious sitting."
----
''[Maybelle is now in the apartment]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "So you're the terrible three this whole building's been talking about. You're thinking about how to get rid of me right now."<br>
'''CJ:''' "Us? Of course not."<br>
'''Carl:''' "Miss Maybelle, could you please make us some popcorn?"<br>
''[The boys snicker]''<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "No!"<br>
''[Later, the boys are scrubbing the floor with toothbrushes]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "The old popcorn trick failed. What are we gonna do?"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Less talking, more scrubbing." ''[Reads her magazine, and ogles over a mango squeezing model]'' "Oh, Javier Luna, you hunk you." ''[The boys are revolted, but Carl gets an idea. Carl takes out his phone. Maybelle gets a call]'' "Maybelle here?"<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[With a smoldering voice]'' "Hola, this is Javier Luna."<br>
'''Maybelle:''' "Javier Luna?"<br>
''[The boys snicker]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "May-bey, I want to cook you dinner at my mansion. I'll be serving mango chicken, mango al-gratte, and mango soufflé"<br>
'''Maybelle:''' ''[Her eyes popping out of her head]'' "I'll be right there! My sweet mango."
----
''[Meanwhile, Carlos and Frida have just arrived at the airport]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Holy Wright brothers, it's beautiful." ''[Frida gets a call]'' "Don't answer it."<br>
''[Tries to grab the phone]''<br>
'''Frida:''' "It could be an emergency." ''[Answers]'' "Hey Maybelle. What? A hot date with a movie star? Maybelle? And she hung up."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Ah, I told you not to answer." ''[Groans]''
----
''[Later, the boys are at the airport with Carlos & Frida]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Operation: Sitter be-gone was a success, and it's a beautiful day for flying."<br>
''[CJ notices the direction they're going]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Uh, Mom, the plane's are that way."<br>
'''Frida:''' "Oh, you're not here for the planes."<br>
'''Carl & CJ:''' "What?"<br>
'''Frida:''' "The only reason you're here is because no one else will watch you. So while we enjoy our flight, you three can sit on that bench and think about what you've done."<br>
''[Points over to a bench made of some crates, the boys go over to it]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Ah, I hate thinking about what I've done. Can we put the bench on the plane?" ''[The boys' padres decline. The boys sit and Frida and Carlos take off while grumbling. The boys sigh in disappointment]'' "All that work for nothing. Well, I'm sorry, but we have come too far. I'm getting on that plane."<br>
''[Carl heads off. CJ and Carlitos gasp and shrug. Carl climbs onto a plane, followed by his hermanos]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "This doesn't look like the old plane. Where's Mom and Dad?"<br>
''[Carlitos presses a button next to the door]''<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' "Welcome to AI Airlines. The world's first self-flying airplane."<br>
'''CJ:''' "We got on the wrong plane."<br>
''[The doors close]''<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' "Please take a seat and prepare for takeoff. Your final destination... the arctic."<br>
'''Carl:''' "The arctic? But I have school tomorrow. And for once I did my homework!"<br>
''[Carl presses some buttons]''<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' "Taking off, in five… four…" ''[The boys gasp]'' "three…" ''[They take their seats]'' "two… one… blast off!"<br>
''[The engines charge up and they burst up into the sky]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "We gotta get off this thing!"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Maybe one of these buttons will make us land."<br>
''[Carl presses a button]''<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' "Activating zero gravity mode."<br>
''[Suddenly Carlitos' pacifier rises up. The boys are amazed]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "I think we can fly."<br>
''[The boys take off their seatbelts and start having fun floating around]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Aw man, this is better than an old dumb plane."<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' "Charming, thank you, Carl."<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Amazed]'' "It knows my name." ''[Tries another button]'' "What else can you do?"<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' "Ending zero gravity mode." ''[The boys drop]'' "Boys, may suggest taking your seats?" ''[The boys quickly do so. The plane offers them something else]'' "And you may need these."<br>
'''Carl:''' "What do we need barf bags for?"<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' "Entering stunt plane mode."<br>
''[The plane starts freestyling, with zigzags and loops. The plane throws itself around, and the boys make use of their complimentary barf bags]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Okay, that's enough of that." ''[Presses more buttons]'' "There's gotta be a landing mode on this dumb smart plane."<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' "Economy mode."<br>
''[Another row of seats pops out in front of them, and flies backwards, crushing them]''<br>
'''Carl:''' ''[Gets out and bangs on the controls]'' "I just wanna land."<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' ''[Offended]'' "Hey! You want to land the plane so bad? Do it yourself. Entering manual mode."<br>
''[Closes the button's panel]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "Uh, what does she mean by... land the plane yourself?"<br>
''[An alarm and a red light go off, and suddenly the plane starts freefalling. The boys freak out]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Come on! We gotta fix this." ''[They go to the controls panel and start hitting buttons]'' "Do any of you guys know how to work this thing?" ''[Carlitos yells at Carl.]'' "I know you're just a baby. We're all babies." ''[He bursts into tears.]'' "I want my mommy!"<br>
''[They all start crying like Frida.]''<br>
'''CJ:''' "We're sorry computer lady, please help us!"<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' ''[Opens up]'' "I'm waiting for Carl's apology."<br>
'''Carl:''' "I'm really sorry for pushing your buttons. Please land the plane for us."<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' "Hmm, you're lucky I like children. Back to your seats boys. I've got this." ''[The boys go to their seats]'' "Landing in three… two… one…" ''[The plane lands]'' "Touchdown complete." ''[CJ and Carlitos hurry off]'' "Oh and Carl, I'll be watching you."<br>
''[Two of it's buttons form eye shapes and look at Carl. He yelps and runs. The boys go back where their parents left them and hug the crates]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Oh! You beautiful bench!"<br>
'''CJ:''' "We're alive!"<br>
''[Carlitos kisses the bench. Just then, their parents return]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Look! It's Mom and Dad!" ''[The boys run and hug their padres]'' Oh, Mom, we are so sorry for being difficult today and scaring away every babysitter."<br>
'''CJ:''' "We promise to be good next time."<br>
'''Carl:''' "We clearly need supervision."<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[Whispers to Frida]'' "What is happening?"<br>
'''Frida:''' ''[Whispers to Carlos]'' "I don't know but I like it." ''[To her hijos]'' "We forgive you mis amores, now come on we should head to the train to get home."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "No need, I took the liberty of calling up one of those cool new self-driving cabs. And look here it is now."<br>
''[The taxi pulls up, with a familiar looking computer]''<br>
'''Plane Computer:''' "Hello, Carl."<br>
''[The boys freak out as the iris closes in on the taxi and winks]''
