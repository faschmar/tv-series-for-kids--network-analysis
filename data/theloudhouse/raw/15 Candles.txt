''[Outside the El Palacio Restaurant, Rosa speed walks up, Ronnie Anne running behind her]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Vamos, Ronnie Anne. I thought we'd kick off our girls' day with a nice lunch."<br>
''[Opens the doors and Ronnie Anne sees inside]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Amazed]'' "Woah." ''[There are chandeliers, real swans in the fountain, a disco floor]'' "Wow, Abuela. I thought we were going to Bruno's hotdog cart. This place is fancy."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "You think so? Could you see having… Oh, I don't know… a birthday party here?"<br>
''[Suddenly, Rosa's purse rumbles and Sergio flies out]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Pshh. I've seen better."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Sergio! Who invited you?!" ''[Grabs Sergio and puts him back in the purse]'' "Just wait until you taste the food, Ronalda." ''[Takes Ronnie Anne to a table and a waiter rolls out a cart, he removes the lid revealing a smorgasbord]'' "Here, try the birria de chivo. It's my fave, as you kids say." ''[Ronnie Anne takes it and tries it. She enjoys it]'' "And don't forget to leave space for dessert." ''[Claps her hands and a chandelier of desserts is lowered to them]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Woah."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Comes out of the purse again]'' "I can smell the dulces. Why are you torturing me?" ''[Rosa stuffs a dulce into Sergio's beak to shut him up. Muffled]'' "Gracias."<br>
''[Stuffs Sergio back in the purse]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Abuela, why are you treating me to all of this?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ay." ''[Takes more desserts]'' "Can't an abuela do something nice for her nieta?" ''[Passes Ronnie Anne the desserts]'' "Eat, eat." ''[Ronnie Anne just shrugs it off]'' "And I have one more treat for our special day…"<br>
''[Her purse belches]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "I'll have another treat too."<br>
''[Takes the cake off Rosa's plate]''
----
''[Later, at Margarita's Beauty Salon]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, this is so nice, Abuela. we should totally do this more often."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I'm so glad to hear you say that Ronnie Anne because…"<br>
'''Rosa & Margarita:''' "Surprise."<br>
''[Margrita lifts the hairdryer off Ronnie Anne's head, revealing that her hair has been styled into the number fifteen]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "We're starting to plan your quinceañera."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[A little confused]'' "My quinceañera? But my fifteenth birthday isn't for another three and a half years.."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I know. I'm sorry for not starting sooner. Frida only took two years to plan Carlota's and the cake was very dry. What a disaster. But don't worry, Ronalda, I have a whole binder full of ideas." ''[Takes out the very large binder and drops it on Ronnie Anne's lap. It's so heavy it breaks the chair Ronnie Anne's sitting on]'' "I promise to devote every Saturday for the next three and a half years to planning the perfect party for you."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Every Saturday? You don't have to do that. I don't need a big party."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Of course you do. La quinceañera is a very important tradition. It marks the moment when a little girl becomes a young woman."<br>
''[Hugs Ronnie Anne tightly, suddenly confetti flies out of Ronnie Anne's hair]''<br>
'''Margarita:''' "Whoops. Heh-heh. Gotta fix the timing on those streamers."
----
''[Later, Ronnie Anne and Sid are playing hacky sack in Sid's room]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "You should have seen her, Sid. I don't think I've ever seen Abuela more excited about anything."<br>
'''Sid:''' "I think it's kind of sweet that she cares so much about your party."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Sid, all my Saturdays. You'll never see me again until I'm fifteen."<br>
''[Kicks the hacky sack against the door so hard it explodes]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Did I say sweet? I meant way over the top. I'm on your side."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Sits on the bed]'' "The whole day she was going on about family and tradition. How do I get out of it?"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Without bumming her out too much." ''[Suddenly, Nico the monkey comes out from under the bed with an idea, and a wrench]'' "Huh. I'll run it by her. Nico says for the small price of a new tire swing and some bananas, he can keep your grandma so busy she won't have time to count to fifteen."<br>
''[Nico offers a handshake]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Deal."<br>
''[Shakes Nico's hand. Nico cackles meniacally]''
----
''[Rosa is looking at her binder and turns to a page with dresses, one of which has a little mirror taped over the head. Rosa sees herself in it and sighs. Ronnie Anne looks at Rosa from the kitchen as she gets a phone call]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Answers]'' "Bueno, Mr. Nakamura."<br>
'''Mr. Nakamura:''' "My toilet's going off like Old Faithful. Doggy-paddle, Nelson!"<br>
''[Suddenly Rosa gets another call]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ah. Just a second, Mr. Nakamura."<br>
''[Answers the other call]''<br>
'''Mrs. Flores:''' "Ay. There's a cowboy monkey riding my faucet like a bucking bronco." ''[Nico is playing in the Flores' sink]'' "Ay. No, no, Not the tortillas!"<br>
''[Another call]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "One moment, Mrs. Flores." ''[Answers]'' "Hector? Where are you calling me from?"<br>
'''Hector:''' "The shower. There's no hot water. My burrito's getting cold."<br>
''[Eats an actual burrito in the shower]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ay, it's gonna take all weekend to fix this mess."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, that's too bad, Abuela. I know you're busy so we can cancel our plans for the day."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Nonsense. I'll just call the second to best plumber in the city."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Huh?"<br>
''[Rosa takes out her toolbelt and whistles. Lalo arrives and Rosa puts the belt on him]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Let's go, Ronnie Anne. We have to see ten venues and start choosing the recuerdos."<br>
''[Takes Ronnie Anne and they leave. Lalo goes to where Hector is, and returns with a burrito]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Hey! Give me back my burrito!"<br>
''[Chases Lalo]''
----
''[Later, Ronnie Anne is in her room, on video chat with Sid]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "New plan, Sid. I convinced the tamale truck owner to hire Abuela to work on Saturdays. She'll be too busy to do anything else."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Are you sure that's gonna work?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What's up gonna do? Cook, drive and party plan at the same time?"<br>
''[Later, Ronnie Anne is in the passenger seat of the tamale truck, fearing for her life. Apparently, Rosa is, in fact, capable of cooking, driving and party planning at the same time. Rosa zooms down the street and lands the truck by a curb. A line forms. Rosa takes the lids off the cooking pots and tosses tamales out the windows. Then she puts the husks on Ronnie Anne like a dress]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "There, these tamal husks really came in handy. Let's get a picture to send to the dressmaker." ''[Takes out a camera]'' "Say cheese."<br>
'''Customer:''' "But I don't want cheese."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Good thing 'cause we're out of cheese. Here's your chicken tamal." ''[Tosses a chicken tamale into the lady's mouth like she were a dolphin. Then puts the husk on Ronnie Anne]'' "Smile, Ronalda."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne fakes a smile as Rosa takes the picture. Rosa returns to working and Ronnie Anne gets a phone call]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Hey, Ronnie Anne. Did your plan work?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "No. My Abuela's unstoppable. We need to think bigger, Sid."<br>
''[Slams her fist on the counter, knocking a bowl of dough in her face. She sighs]''
----
''[Back at the apartment, Ronnie Anne is telling Sid about her new plan]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Carl promised me his plan is fail-proof. And since I'm doing his chores for a month this better work." ''[Ronnie Anne closes the curtains and sets up a projector]'' "Abuela, special delivery. Ernesto Estrella just sent you one of his new personalized hologram messages."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Excited]'' "Ernest sent me a message? Where?"<br>
''[In the light of the projector, Carl appears, dressed like Ernesto Estrella]''<br>
'''Carl:''' "Rosa, this special hologram message is just for you."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Why is he so short?"<br>
'''Carl:''' "Uh… Well, 'cause a mere hologram could never contain my true magnificence. Now, where was I? Ah, yes. Saturdays are bad luck. You must not plan anything on that day for three…" ''[Sees Ronnie Anne holding up four fingers]'' "No, four years. Es tu desti…" ''[Lalo wants to play tug of war with Carl]'' "No!" ''[Tries to take the dress back]'' "Lalo!" ''Tries to make sense of this]'' "You see? Even your dog is worried. Estrella. Ouch!"<br>
''[Lalo lets go and Carl goes flying behind the chair]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Actually bought it, gasps]'' "Ronalda, if Ernesto says we can't do any more planning on Saturdays, then we can't do it." ''[Rosa doesn't see Lalo dragging Carl by his wig]'' "We can't risk your quinceañera."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Aw, that's too bad."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "We'll have to move the planning to Sundays."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "And since we need to add eight hours of vals dance training every week we better put that on Friday nights."<br>
''[Leaves]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What? What? Now I'm gonna lose my Sundays and Friday nights too? I don't know how even she doesn't get tired of all of this."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Hmm. But what if she did? What if you gave her a taste of her own medicine?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, Sid, you're bad. So bad it's good."<br>
''[They both rub their hands together and laugh diabolically]''
----
''[That night, Hector, Sergio and Rosa are all sleeping together. When suddenly Rosa and Sergio wake up to the sound of mariachi music, which Hector doesn't even notice. Ronnie Anne has a mariachi band playing in the room]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ronnie Anne, what are you doing?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Picking out music for the quinceañera. Little louder boys, for the people in the back."<br>
''[The band cranks it up and the sound blows Rosa away. The next morning, Rosa is napping on the couch, when suddenly she notices Ronnie Anne doing her hair to look like the number fifteen]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ronalda, what are you doing?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Giving you a fabulous hairdo for the quince. What do you think? I'm really feeling it."<br>
''[Blowdries Rosa's hair, blowing her over again. Later, Rosa is hanging up the laundry, when suddenly Ronnie Anne puts a ginormous dress on her]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "What's going on?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "What do you think of this dress? Extra puffy."<br>
''[So puffy that the wind blows Rosa off the side of the building]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ronalda!"
''[On the sidewalk, Hector is innocently eating a torta, when his esposa gently floats down and lands on him]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Comes out from under Rosa's dress and sees his torta on the ground]'' "No! My torta!"<br>
''[Rosa just glares at him]''
----
''[Later, Rosa enters Ronnie Anne's room]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ronalda, we need to talk about all this party planning."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Enthusiastically]'' "Is it too much? I mean, we can always put it off."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "No. I've been dropping the ball. Seeing your enthusiasm made me realize that I should be doing better. So I cancelled your skateboarding camp this summer." ''[Takes out an even bigger binder]'' "Here's a brand new binder of ideas for you to look at." ''[Drops the even heavier binder on Ronnie Anne's bed, sending her flying into her spare hoodie]'' "Read up, and later on, we can work on your speech."<br>
''[Rosa leaves and Ronnie Anne's had enough]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "That's it." ''[Gets herself down]'' "I'm gonna go tell Abuela I'm done."<br>
''[Pulls the heave binder off her bed and drags it out of the room. She pushes it along the floor. Meanwhile, Maria is innocently getting a drink from the fridge, walks out of the kitchen, when suddenly a stack of party ideas crushes her foot]''<br>
'''Maria:''' "Ow!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Sorry, Mom."<br>
'''Maria:''' "What's going on, Ronnie Anne?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Abuela's gone way too far with this quinceañera stuff. I can't do this anymore."<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Understanding]'' "Look, Ronnie Anne, I know exactly what you're going through because she did the same thing to me. And I blew up at her, but then I learned that she was going overboard with the planning stuff because she never had a quinceañera."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Really? She didn't?"<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Takes Ronnie Anne to where she can see Rosa, who is trying boutonnieres on Hector]'' "No, she really wanted one but her family couldn't afford it. So our quinceañeras are the next best thing to have one herself. Can you just try to be patient with her?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Sighs]'' "You know what, Mom? I think I have a better idea."
----
''[Ronnie Anne is guiding a blindfolded Rosa down the street]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Where are you taking me, Ronnie Anne?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "You'll see. I found the perfect venue for the quince…" ''[Opens the doors to El Palacio]'' "Your quince."<br>
''[Remove the blindfold]''<br>
'''Party Guests:''' "Surprise!"<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Gasps. Touched]'' "You did this all for me?"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Yep. You're never too old for a quinceañera." ''[Rosa wipes away a tear and hugs Ronnie Anne]'' "Time to get dressed."<br>
'''Margarita:''' "And get your hair done."
----
''[Later, Rosa is in the extra puffy dress, her hair styled like the number fifteen. Everyone is so happy for her. Rosa walks down the stairs, Frida snapping photos and sobbing, while holding a rather miffed Carlitos]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Walks up to Rosa, with a high-heeled shoe and gets on one knee]'' "May I have this vals, mi flor?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Si, carino."<br>
''[Lifts up her dress and Hector symbolically puts the shoes on her feet. Then he takes her to the dance floor and they dance together. Everyone applauds. Rosa goes over to the microphone]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I want to thank mi nieta, Ronnie Anne, for this beautiful surprise. I didn't realize that not getting a quinceañera had left such a hole in my heart. But now it feels so full." ''[Everyone cheers]'' "I'm sorry, Ronalda. Clearly, you can plan the perfect quinceañera. No extra Saturdays or Sundays required." ''[Picks up a drink]'' "So salud."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[Holds up her own drink]'' "I'll cheers to that. Salud."<br>
''[They clink glasses and Rosa's hair pops confetti. The party continues. Frida takes photos, Lalo sneaks a bite of the cake, Carl spins the turntables and everyone dances. Sergio sees the swan fountain]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Ooh, a pool party. Don't mind if I do."<br>
''[Removes his tux and is wearing a mankini. She splashes into the fountain, the swans notice]''
