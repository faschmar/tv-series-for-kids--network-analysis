''[Rosa is fixing the floor on the stairwell of the building, suddenly Mrs. Kernicky and Mrs. Flores jump down]''<br>
'''Mrs. Kernicky:''' "Ah! Can't wait for dance class tonight! I'm gonna get my groove on."<br>
'''Mrs. Flores:''' "Right? And dancing is just so romantic."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Did you say dancing? I love dancing."<br>
'''Mrs. Kernicky:''' "Well, you're in luck! There's a new ballroom dance studio that opened up nearby."<br>
''[Gives Rosa a flyer]''<br>
'''Mrs. Flores:''' "Yes, come! The teacher is amazing. And the first class is free. Hope to see you there."<br>
''[Mrs. Kernicky leaps down the stairs, Mrs. Flores follows. Rosa looks at the flyer and imagines herself and Hector dancing together. In her fantasy she is leaned back, which she is also doing in reality, she falls over. Meanwhile, in the apartment, Hector and his amigos are watching the game]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Futból and nachos, my two favourite things!"<br>
'''Vito:''' "Oh, I love stuffing my face while other people exercise."<br>
''[Vito grabs some nachos from Bruno's bowl, Hector starts rapidly eating from his bowl]''<br>
'''Bruno:''' "Yuck."<br>
''[Rosa walks up]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Hector, there's a new ballroom dance class happening tonight."<br>
''[Holds the flyer close to Hector. Hector, who is still rapidly eating his nachos, accidentally eats the flyer and starts choking]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "I got a bad nacho."<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Takes the flyer back]'' "That's the flyer for the class. Let's try it. It would mean so much to me."<br>
'''Hector:''' "But the Gatos are playing, I can't leave the boys in the middle of the game." ''[Vito, Sergio and Bruno agree]'' "Besides my old school moves are just fine. Look, I can do the merengue," ''[demonstrates]'' "salsa, oldies. I'm a dancing machine."<br>
''[Continues dancing]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Feeling disrespected]'' "Fine, if your game is so important, I'll go take the class alone."<br>
''[Leaves in a huff]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Assuming the best]'' "Knew you'd understand. Love you!"<br>
''[Waves as the door slams]''<br>
'''Bruno:''' "I feel like that's gonna come back to bite you later."
----
''[Later, Rosa walks to the class, alone. Many of her neighbours are here also, but they all have someone to dance with]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "What am I doing? I can't dance alone maybe I should just go home."<br>
''[She sadly turns to leave, when suddenly the teacher puts a hand on her]''<br>
'''Ivan:''' "Hello, beautiful. may I have this dance?"<br>
''[Rosa gives him her hand and follows]''
----
''[Back at the apartment, Hector and his amigos are still watching the game ad the Gatos score a goal from center field]''<br>
'''Announcer:''' "Goal! Gatos win!"<br>
'''Hector, Bruno, Vito & Sergio:''' ''[Doing their own victory dances]'' "Meow! Meow! Meow! Gatos win now, now, now!"<br>
''[Rosa struts in]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Oh, how was class, Rosa?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "The best! My new partner really knows how to move."<br>
''[Spins away]''<br>
'''Vito:''' ''[To Hector]'' "Ha, you hear that? She's got a new partner."<br>
'''Bruno:''' "Who can really move."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Unlike you."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Are you saying I should be jealous?" ''[The boys look at each other and agree]'' "Ah. Well, too bad. I'm not"
----
''[Hector is changing the kitchen light when a phone rings]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Who is cooking]'' "Bueno? Ivan! I was thinking about you too!" ''[Laughs]'' "Oh, stop."<br>
''[Takes the call elsewhere]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[A little miffed]'' "Oye nada. Whoa!" ''[The ladder he's on tips and he hands from the light he's changing. Sergio, who was holding the ladder, squawks at him]'' "What? I'm not jealous."<br>
''[The light breaks off and Hector drops]''
----
''[Later, Mrs. Flores, Mrs. Kernicky and Vito are in the mercado, the ladies chatting among themselves]''<br>
'''Mrs. Kernicky:''' "Have you noticed how much chemistry Rosa and Ivan have in dane class?" ''[Giggles]''<br>
'''Mrs. Flores:''' "Who wouldn't have chemistry with him? He's so handsome. And his moves."<br>
''[They both giggle as Mrs. Flores takes her groceries and they leave. Hector crumples up his newspaper, grumbling, then sees Vito looking at him]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "I'm not jealous."<br>
'''Vito:''' "Heh, right. your eye always twitches like that."<br>
''[Hector's eye is in fact twitching]''
----
''[Hector, Vito, Sergio and Hector are having lunch together in the apartment. Rosa walks past with a plate piled high with tamales]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Ooh, tamales for us? Thank you!"<br>
''[Takes one, then Rosa takes it back]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "No, no, no this is from my dance class. I promised Ivan a home-cooked meal."<br>
''[Leaves. Hector has had it]''<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Growls]'' "Now I'm jealous! You don't steal a man's tamales!" This dancing bobo has got to go!"<br>
''[Charges out the door followed by Vito and Sergio]''<br>
'''Vito & Sergio:''' "Yeah! Let's get him!"<br>
'''Bruno:''' "Hey, what about the game?"<br>
''[Hector grabs Bruno by the arm and yanks him along]''
----
''[At the dance studio, Hector peeks out from behind a mailbox, and sneaks past the windows. He signals for the others to follow. They peek in through the window and gasp]''<br>
'''Vito:''' "Woah. That's her partner?" ''[Ivan is a total hunk with a sparkly unbuttoned shirt, huge pecs and long flowing hair. He's holding Rosa up with one arm. He gestures the rest of the class to his footwork]'' "Looks like he's also the teacher." ''[To Hector]'' "So what's the plan? How do we stop this gorgeous hunk?"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Thinks]'' "Well, they have class without electricity."<br>
''[Snickers, and keeps snickering at the electric box behind the building as he opens it and shuts off the power. The class is surprised]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Gasps]'' "The power went out!"<br>
'''Mrs. Flores:''' "How will we have class now?"<br>
'''Ivan:''' "In romantic candlelight, my twinkle toes."<br>
''[Holds up a candle holder with three lit candles. He uses it to light three more candles on a stand, five more on the chandelier, he then blows on them, sending a blaze of fire lighting every other candle in the room, the class is very amazed]''<br>
'''Mrs. Flores:''' "Ay, fantastico."<br>
''[Ivan takes Rosa and dances with her in the candlelight. The class applauds and Hector growls]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' "Amateurs. Leave the sabotage to me." ''[Later, Hector, Bruno and Vito are hiding behind a bush and Sergio opens the door, holding a dead fish]'' "Come and get it, actual gatos!"<br>
''[Tosses the fish inside as the street cats go for it. Sergio closes the door after them. They all go back to the window to peek inside, the cats are all snuggling with Ivan]''<br>
'''Ivan:''' "Animals love me."<br>
''[Everyone, including Rosa, thinks this is adorable and applaud him again. Hector growls again]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "You win this time, Ivan. But this isn't over!"
----
''[Back at the mercado]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "We gotta figure out a way to stop this dance class. All Rosa talks about is Ivan this, dancing that, and now she's going every night. I want my wife back."<br>
'''Bruno:''' ''[His head screwed on right]'' "Here's a wild idea just go and dance with her."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Nah. What kind of bobo idea is that? We need a real plan. One that gets Ivan and his moves out of our lives forever."<br>
''[Suddenly the health inspector arrives]''<br>
'''Henry:''' "Howdy, boys. Your turn for a surprise inspection, Hector."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Oh. Hey, Henry."<br>
'''Henry:''' ''[Regarding Sergio]'' "That bird yours? Wild animals are a health code violation, you know. They're filthy!"<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Hey! I bathe…" ''[Sniffs under his wings and applies a roll-on deoderant]'' "Sometimes."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Sergio's okay. He's our pet."<br>
''[Henry and Sergio stare each other down, Henry sniffs]''<br>
'''Henry:''' "Okay, Bird seems clean enough. All good"<br>
''[Tips his hat and leaves. Hector gets an idea]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "That's it! I know exactly how to get rid of that bobo, Ivan, and his bobo dance class."<br>
'''Bruno:''' "Oh boy, here we go again."<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Growls]'' "Come on, Vito. I'm gonna need your help."<br>
''[Hector and Vito leave. Meanwhile, Sergio is washing himself in the mercado's drink dispenser]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "See? I bathe. Refill?"<br>
'''Bruno:''' "I'm good."
----
''[Back at the dance studio, Hector arrives dressed as a health inspector, with a very lumpy and noisy jacket]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Sancho, you guys, quit squirming." ''[Sancho pops out of the jacket for air, Hector shoves him back in]'' "Wait until I give the signal." ''[Inside, Ivan is practicing his dancing. Hector walks in]'' "Health inspector."<br>
'''Ivan:''' "Oh. I didn't know we were due for an inspection. Be right with you." ''[Gets up and puts his chair away. With Ivan not looking, Hector releases Sancho and the pigeons into the rafters. Ivan returns]'' "Sorry, I get caught up in my art."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Well, you're so caught up, you didn't notice you have an infestation." ''[Points up]'' "Wild animals are a health code violation, you know." ''[Ivan looks and sees the pigeons chilling in the lighting grid. One poops on Hector's bald head. The rest continue pooping]'' "I'm shutting you down."<br>
'''Ivan:''' "Wait. Please give me a chance to get rid of the birds. My class has a recital next week and we still need to reverse."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Not my problem. It's for public health."<br>
'''Ivan:''' ''[Sighs]'' "I understand."<br>
''[Sadly turns the OPEN sign to CLOSED. Hector joins his amigos outside]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Score one for Team Hector.:<br>
'''Bruno:''' "I feel like a world-class wiener."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Yeah, but a wiener that wins."<br>
''[Hector and Vito fist bump. But Bruno sighs]''
----
''[Back at the apartment, Rosa is on the phone]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Of course it's fine. Come right over. See you soon, Ivan."<br>
''[Laughs and hangs up, Hector and Sergio are here, Hector is shocked by what he just heard]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Ivan? He's still hanging arou… I mean… what's up, Rosa?"<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Oh, the health department closed down Ivan's dance studio so we're having class here tonight. They'll be here any minutes now."<br>
'''Hector:''' "What? Here? But it's game night." ''[Rosa gives him a harsh look]'' "Which we can do at Vito's."<br>
''[There's a knock at the door]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Ah. that must be that now."<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Whispers to the panicky Hector]'' "He'll recognize you. Quick, hide."<br>
''[Hector ducks away. Meanwhile, Rosa is leading a conga line into the apartment]''<br>
'''Ivan:''' "And now, a warm-up conga line! Loosen up those hips and shake 'em. Loosen up those hips and shake 'em." ''[Hector comes out from under the ottoman cushions and moves. He pops out from behind the TV…]''  "Loosen up those hips and shake 'em. Loosen up those hips and shake 'em." ''[..and duck again when the conga line passes. He tries to escape through Ronnie Anne's room, but the conga line somehow comes out of it]'' "Loosen up those hips and shake 'em."<br>
''[Hector peers out of the bathroom, but the conga line comes out of that and unknowingly follows him into Bobby's room. No matter where Hector goes the conga line is following him without even knowing. Hector dives through the kitchen window, just as the line enters the kitchen. They exit and Rosa sees two feet under the table]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Hector, what are you doing under the table?"<br>
''[Removes the tablecloth]''<br>
'''Ivan:''' "Huh? You're the health inspector who shut down my studio."<br>
''[Hector looks at Ivan, then at Rosa, who seems very interested in what Ivan just said]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "Ooh, this is gonna be good."<br>
''[Has his popcorn ready]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Him? He's not a health inspector. He's my husband."<br>
'''Mrs. Kernicky:''' "Awkward."<br>
'''Ivan:''' "It seems you two have a lot to talk about. I'm going to reopen my studio."<br>
'''Mrs. Kernicky:''' "Time to bounce, everyone."<br>
''[Everyone exits the apartment and Hector looks back at Rosa]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Hector Casagrande, explain."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Well, I was tired of hearing you talk about Ivan and this dance class, okay? So I thought if I shut it down that would be the end of it."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Hector! How could you be so selfish? I don't want to talk to you right now."<br>
''[Goes to the door and is so mad she rips it right out of the wall and throws it away. Vito and Bruno arrive]''<br>
'''Bruno:''' ''[Knew this was a bad idea from the start]'' "Gee, who could have seen this coming?"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Sighs]'' "I need to fix this."<br>
''[Leaves]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Belches]'' "And I need more popcorn."
----
''[Back at the studio, Hector arrives with a mop and bucket as Ivan is meditating with the pigeons]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Wow, animals really do love you."<br>
''[The pigeons fly away]''<br>
'''Ivan:''' "Now what do you want?"<br>
'''Hector:''' "I'm here to apologize. And to help clean up so Rosa and her class can dance here again. I'm sorry, Ivan, I was jealous of how much fun Rosa was having in your class. But if dancing with you makes her happy that's all that matters."<br>
'''Ivan:''' "I see. Honestly, this happens to me a lot. I face many jealous beaus. My husband says it's the curse of being this handsome. But it's also taught me how to read people, and I think what would make Rosa truly happy is to dance with you, not with me."<br>
'''Hector:''' "I don't know if can handle all those fancy moves you guys do." ''[Out of nowhere, Ivan grabs Hector and starts dancing with him]'' "What are you doing?"<br>
'''Ivan:''' "Teaching you, soon my fancy moves will be your fancy moves. Now come, we have a recital to prepare for."<br>
'''Hector:''' "Okay you handsome bobo show me what you got."<br>
''[They dance together]''
----
''[At the recital, Rosa and Hector are dancing together as all their amigos applaud]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Thank you for doing this with me."<br>
'''Hector:''' "It's what I should have done in the first place. And it is kind of fun."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "I'm glad you feel that way because I signed us up for the advanced class, and it starts tomorrow."<br>
'''Hector:''' "What? I mean, I'd love to."<br>
''[They continue dancing]''<br>
'''Ivan:''' ''[Who is at a table with Vito, Bruno and Sergio]'' "Beautiful! My best students! Now, everybody, finale conga! Let's go!" ''[Leads a conga line past Rosa and Hector]'' "Move those hips!"<br>
''[Rosa and Hector keep dancing together and share a kiss in the heart shaped iris out]''
