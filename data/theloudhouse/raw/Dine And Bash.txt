{{Transcript}}
''[Vanzilla pulls up to Royal Woods High School and picks up Leni, Luna, and Luan. Todd is driving while all the Loud kids are inside.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' ''[holding his phone]'' "I can't wait to see this episode!"<br>
''[He's watching an episode of ''Kitchen Ambush'']''<br>
'''Announcer:''' "Last time on ''Kitchen Ambush'', Chef Guy Grazer turned up the heat."<br>
''[On Lincoln's phone, Guy takes a sip of soup and immediately spits it out.]''<br>
'''Guy:''' "Miserable!" ''[to the cook]'' "Your dish lacks taste, just like your tacky apron!"<br>
''[He throws the soup on the camera, cutting to the show's title.]''<br>
'''Announcer:''' "Who will Guy ambush tonight? Tune into find out."<br>
'''Mr. Coconuts:''' "Yeesh! I'd hate to be in her shoes. He shredded her like a block of cheddar!"<br>
''[Vanzilla pulls up to Lynn's Table and drops the kids off]''<br>
'''Todd:''' "'''HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON, SWEETIES. DON'T FORGET TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK.'''" ''[points at Lisa]'' "'''I'LL BE CHECKING.'''" ''[drives off]''<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Note to self: Dial back Todd's maternal mode."<br>
''[Inside Lynn's Table, the Louds are overwhelmed to see that it's crowded. Lynn Sr. places two plates on the counter.]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Oh, good, you're here! Before you jump into homework, I need your help with the afternoon rush."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "No problem. Guys, fan out!"<br>
''[The Louds split up to serve. Lincoln grabs the plates and serves them to a couple. Lola serves Cheryl and Meryl bread.]''<br>
'''Lola:''' "Here you are, ladies!"<br>
'''Meryl:''' "Ooh! Nothing like a plate of hot buns!"<br>
''[Lana is jotting down Mr. Grouse's order.]''<br>
'''Lana:''' "So that is two hockey pucks, side of dough, well done, with axel grease."<br>
'''Mr. Grouse:''' "I ordered sausage patties and toast with butter."<br>
'''Lana:''' "Yeah, that's what I just said."<br>
''[Grant is writing the bill for a family.]''<br>
'''Grant:''' "Your total comes out to... carry the nine, subtract by seven, divide-"<br>
'''Lisa:''' "$43.17. Plus a 20% gratuity of $8.63."<br>
''[Luna places an order on the slip, and Luan grabs it. More shots show washing tomatoes, grating cheese, cutting a sausage, and readying a pizza and burrito. Luna serves a pizza, someone else serves a burrito and another dish, and Lucy serves a group of kids a birthday cake. The dishes are all placed in the sink before washing. Later, the Loud kids enter the kitchen and collapse in exhaustion.]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Woohoo! We did it! Oh, you kids are a big help, especially with Mom off visiting Lori for Mother-Daughter Golf Day!"<br>
''[At Fairway, Rita is stuck in a bunker and angrily swings her sand iron so hard the ball ricochets off a tree, whizzes past Lori's head, and hits someone offscreen as their car begins beeping.]''<br>
'''Random Student:''' "Ow!"<br>
''[Back at Lynn's Table, a phone starts ringing.]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[picks up]'' "Lynn's Table, come in if you're able. You've got Lynn."<br>
''[Split-screen between Lynn Sr. and Kotaro.]''<br>
'''Kotaro:''' "Lynn, I have some exciting news! The Doo Dads just booked a big gig tonight at Sunset Canyon!"<br>
''[The camera reveals that Kotaro is actually standing outside the counter.]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[gasps]'' "No. We. Dadn't!"<br>
'''Kotaro:''' "Yes we dad! It's Bernie's third wedding! He's marrying his lady friend from Boca!"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[realizes]'' "Ohhh! Ding dang darn it! I have to work the dinner shift. I gave Grant the night off to play ''Orcs, Horks, Wizards and Pork'' with his friends."<br>
'''Grant:''' ''[shows up in a wizard costume]'' "Many thanks, Spirit Wizard Loud! May your harvest be fruitful this moon!" ''[throws confetti and leaves]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' ''[sighs]'' "You guys should just do the gig without this Doo Dad."<br>
'''Kotaro:''' "But a band with just one cowbell is no band at all."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Hey, Dad, what if we took over the restaurant tonight?"<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Aw, that's sweet of you guys, but a night alone's a big responsibility."<br>
'''Lola:''' ''[chuckles]'' "We know this place like the back of our flawless hands." ''[takes off her right glove and notices something]'' "Ew! Time for a mani."<br>
'''Kotaro:''' "Come on, Lynn. They can do it."<br>
''[The kids agree]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Huh. Well, OK. But if there's an emergency, you give me a call. And when in doubt, use my cookbook." ''[hands it to Leni]'' "Every recipe I've ever made is in that thing."<br>
'''Luan:''' ''[grabs a rag]'' "Ooh! You won't ''rag''-ret this!"<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Uh, Luan, that's Father's sweat rag."<br>
'''Luan:''' "Ugh!" ''[throws it out the kitchen]''<br>
'''Lynn Sr.:''' "Thanks, kids! Kotaro, polish up our wedding cowbells! We've got a reception buffet to rock!"
----
''[Later that night.]''<br>
'''Luan:''' "Order up!" ''[flings pancakes to a plate Lynn is holding]'' "Way up!"<br>
''[Lincoln lathers the pancakes with sugar and fruits before Lynn puts it on the counter and rings the bell. The twins grab it and serve it to Scoots.]''<br>
'''Scoots:''' "You expect me to eat these without-"<br>
'''Lisa:''' "Maple syrup?" ''[Lathers the pancakes with maple syrup. Scoots removes her fake teeth, shoves the pancakes in her mouth, and burps]'' "Your total comes out to $8. Not including tip, of course."<br>
'''Scoots:''' "Here's a tip: Pack an umbrella tomorrow. It's gonna rain."<br>
''[She drives off laughing.]''
----
''[Later, Lana polishes a table]''<br>
'''Lana:''' "That was the last customer. What was Dad so worried about, anyway?"<br>
'''Lynn:''' "Yeah, we crushed it." ''[laughs; the door opens]'' "Oh-oh?"<br>
''[Guy Grazer is at the door and gives a menacing grin. The Louds gasp.]''<br>
'''Lucy:''' "It's Guy Grazer."<br>
'''Guy:''' "That's right! I've heard a lot about this place and wanted to feature it on ''Kitchen Ambush''."<br>
'''Lola:''' "Now?!"<br>
'''Guy:''' "It's called ''Kitchen Ambush'', not ''Kitchen Whenever It's Convenient For You''!"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Um, would you give us a moment?"<br>
''[The siblings huddle]''<br>
'''Luan:''' "Uh, what do we do? Should we call Dad?"<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "No. He's playing his gig. Let him enjoy Bernie's wedding. Besides, we can totally handle Guy." ''[turns to Guy]'' "We're in!"<br>
'''Guy:''' "Good, because my appetizer should have been here FIVE FLAMBÉ-IN' MINUTES AGO!" ''[The Louds hurry into the kitchen. Guy inspects the menu while his camera crew films]'' "Lynn-ger chicken? Lynn-sagna? Balsamic Lynn-egar? Ugh, puns. The dry toast of the cooking world."<br>
''[He shoves the menu into the cameraman, forcing the woman holding the mic to continue filming. Back inside the kitchen, the Louds frantically start cooking]''<br>
'''Lana:''' "Coming through!"<br>
'''Luan:''' "OK, uh, gotta get some apps ready. Paprika, garlic powder. Does anyone have the thyme?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "It's 7:30."<br>
'''Mr. Coconuts:''' "You walked right into that one, toots."<br>
'''Lucy:''' ''[enters the kitchen]'' "I brought Guy a plate of jalapeño poppers and bread to start."<br>
'''Lisa:''' "You did? But I just brought over jalapeño poppers and bread."<br>
'''Lana:''' ''[enters the kitchen]'' "No need to worry, everyone. I brought Guy some jalapeño poppers and bread to tide him over."<br>
''[Lisa and Lucy facepalm. Lincoln checks the dining room to see that Guy is buried in bread and spits one out.]''<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "Lucy, can you go take Guy's order?"<br>
''[Lucy nods and rushes out the door.]''<br>
'''Guy:''' ''[sarcastically]'' "What will I have? Bring me one of everything! And how about some more bread? I don't think there's enough for the entire state of Michigan!"<br>
''[Lucy enters the kitchen, completely frazzled.]''<br>
'''Luan:''' "OK, let's not panic. We can still turn this around with Dad's great food. Now where's his cookbook?"<br>
'''Leni:''' "Got it right here." ''[she's stirring a mix with it]'' "What? He said when in doubt, use his cookbook."<br>
''[Her siblings groan and facepalm]''<br>
'''Luan:''' "Oh, Leni." ''[takes the cookbook]'' "I can still make out some of his ca-Lynn-mari recipe, and his New Eng=Lynn clam chowder one."<br>
'''Lincoln:''' "It'll have to do! Let's just get cooking."
----
''[Later, the Louds serve Guy tortillas, ribs, mashed potatoes, burgers and fries, and chicken drumsticks. He picks up a rib to inspect the quality. Lily comes up.]''<br>
'''Guy:''' "More children?! Is this a restaurant or a preschool?! Are there any adults in here?"<br>
'''Lana:''' "Actually, this is our dad's place. We're just helping out tonight."<br>
'''Guy:''' "Well, that explains everything! Alright, off with you."<br>
'''Lucy:''' "Bye."<br>
''[Lana, Lucy, Luna, and Lily hurry back to the kitchen, where the rest of their siblings are watching.]''<br>
'''Guy:''' "Hmm. Right. I think we have enough footage for tonight's show."<br>
''[He leaves, and the Louds sigh and collapse]''<br>
'''Lynn:''' "Welp, this bites. If that episode airs, Dad's restaurant is crushed."
