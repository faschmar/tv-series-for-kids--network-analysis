''[Casagrande Apartment. Ronnie Anne has packed what seems to be a sleeping bag, and is humming when she bumps into her cross grandparents.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[grunts]'' "Uh, can I just get to the door?"<br>
''[Which is blocked by her Abuela and Abuelo.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Sergio tells us you're camping in Great Lakes City Cemetary tonight."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "''Mis bebes''? At a ''cemetary''? ''At night?!'' '''Nunca!'''"<br>
'''Hector:''' "Much too scary for kids."<br>
'''Sergio:''' "''*Bawk!*'' Even for ''me''!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Well, that's the point. Legend has it forty years ago, a group known as the Fearless Four spent the entire night in the cemetary. No one's been brave enough to do it since. Until tonight."<br>
''[Carlos and Maria are on the couch, the former on a book and the latter munching on popcorn.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "And Mom gave me permission."<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Well, I'm ''her'' mom and I didn't give her permission to give ''you'' permission."<br>
'''Maria:''' "Oh, come on, Mama. You let Carlos and me go when we were kids."<br>
'''Carlos:''' ''[closes his book]'' "Heh! Maybe you'll make it longer than we did. Maria couldn't last an hour."<br>
'''Maria:''' "Oh -- ''Me''? ''You'' wanted to leave."<br>
'''Carlos:''' "Daw -- guuuuh, pretty sure that was ''you''."<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[pushing Carlos' book off the couch]'' "I really don't think so."<br>
''[One brief moment of pouting later, and the two engage in a cat fight.]''<br>
'''Maria:''' "You gonna ''cwy'', huh?! Gonna cry, widdle baby boy?"<br>
''[Carlos displays tearful eyes, then...]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' "''MOM!!''"<br>
''[Rosa sighs in exasperation; Ronnie Anne is confused.]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' "Aye..."<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Ugh. Come on! You let ''them'' go." ''[begging]'' "Please? ''Por favor''?"<br>
''[She displays puppy eyes, which she shows Hector.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Pwease?"<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[now making puppy dog eyes of his own]'' "Oh, no! She's using her puppy dog eyes!"<br>
''[Ronnie Anne whimpers like a saddened dog.]''<br>
'''Hector:''' "Must... look away!" ''[takes one look at a now-tearful Ronnie Anne]'' "Can't... ''resist!''" ''[giving in]'' "Okay, mija, fine... you can go."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne is jumping in joy.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Thank you, thank you!" ''[Gives her Abuelo a kiss.]'' "Gracias!"<br>
''[She runs out, overjoyed; Rosa and Sergio have been watching, and are not pleased. Hector laughs nervously.]''<br>
'''Sergio:''' "You're a weak man."
----
''[At the cemetery, the kids have arrived.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Everyone ready to brave the haunted cemetery?" ''[laughs evilly, shining a flashlight on her face]''<br>
''[The other kids laugh at this.]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "Yup! I brought my dad's night vision goggles."<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[coming out of the tent]'' "I brought two pairs of underwear."<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Got my spell book to ward off gnarly spirits."<br>
'''Laird:''' "And I brought my security blanket! I'm fearless with this thing."<br>
''[A hoot startles Laird, who takes cover.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "Come here, Gail!" ''[Gail perches on her arm]'' "My mom's taking care of Gail. She said he can keep watch for us all night."<br>
''[The owl's head turns 360 degrees, then hoots.]''<br>
'''Sid:''' "One hoot means the coat is clear; no ghosts, zombies or werewolves."<br>
'''Laird:''' "What does ''two'' hoots mean?"<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[sinister]'' "'''RUN.'''"<br>
----
''[Some time later, Gail is on guard; his head turns again, and hoots once. Inside the tent, the kids are doing numerous activities; Ronnie Anne throws a chip across the tent, and Sid catches, and eats, it.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' ''[gasps]'' "See? This isn't so scary."<br>
'''Laird:''' "Y-yeah!" ''[taking his blanket]'' "Maybe I don't even ''need'' this."<br>
''[He tosses it away with a confident smile; then is startled by the wind blowing and what looks like an arm. With that, he ducks under his blanket, whimpering; Sid and Nikki laugh at this.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Oh, come on, Laird. It's just the wind."<br>
''[She is about to eat a chip; the moment she bites into it, a ghoulish voice is heard from outside. Her eyes dart across the tent as it speaks...]''<br>
'''Ghoulish Voice:''' "''Oooooh~! You better leave~!''"<br>
'''Laird:''' "The wind is suddenly ''very'' articulate..."<br>
'''Casey:''' "M..maybe ''someone'' should check it out."<br>
''[To decide who goes out, the kids do a...]''<br>
'''Kids:''' "DIBS NOT!"<br>
''[...which startles Casey, and he touches his nose last.]''<br>
'''Casey:''' "DIBS NOT!... Gah..." ''[Ronnie Anne pushes Casey out of the tent.]'' "Did I say, uh... "check it out?" I was kidding! C'mon, you know I like to joke! People are always calling me 'Casey the Kidder'! Heh heh... heh..." ''[Ronnie Anne pokes her head out of the tent and bops her nose; reaffirming Casey has to check it out.]'' "''Ugh...'' Fine, I'll go." ''[Casey exits the tent perimeter.]'' "Aw well. At least I have these night-vision goggles." ''[He sneaks around.]'' "Anyone out here?" "AAAAAH!!" ''[turns around to see no one there]'' "Oh... Ha ha. Nice try, guys." ''[the finger pokes him again]'' "AAAAAH!! This isn't funny..." ''[We see the skeleton is lying on a gravestone.]'' "Uuhhh... Aren't skeletons supposed to be ''in'' the ground?" ''[The skeleton stands up.]'' "And they're definitely not supposed to be ''WALKING!!''"<br>
''[He throws his goggles at it; it doesn't work, so he bolts out of the cemetery, terrified and screaming for dear life. Back inside the tent, the kids hear Casey's screaming.]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Did you hear that? It was Casey!"<br>
'''Laird:''' "Maybe something got him!"<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Or he's just trying to scare us. He said people call him Casey the Kidder."<br>
'''Sameer:''' "No one calls him that."<br>
'''Sid:''' "Someone should go look for him!"<br>
'''All:''' ''[touching their noses]'' "DIBS NOT!" ''[look at each other and realize...]''<br>
'''Nikki:''' "Ugh, it's a tie! What do we do now?"<br>
'''Laird:''' "Uh, none of us go?" ''[the others glare at him]'' "Huh?"
----
''[One screen-wipe later, the kids are looking for Casey.]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "CASEY!"<br>
'''Sid:''' "Where are you?"<br>
'''Nikki:''' "It's us!"<br>
'''Laird:''' "Come on out, Casey!"<br>
'''Sameer:''' ''[suddenly stops]'' "Look!" ''[points at...]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' "Casey's goggles!" ''[picks them up]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' This is bad!"<br>
'''Nikki:''' ''[suddenly giggles, then clears her throat]'' "Sorry. I giggle when I'm nervous."<br>
''[Ronnie Anne is unamused, she looks ahead and sees the path leads in two directions]''<br>
'''Sid:''' “Hmm… If I were running for my life, which way would I go?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Maybe we should…”<br>
'''Sameer:''' “Don't say it.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Split up.”<br>
''[She, Sid a Laird go right]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' “Ronnie Anne! I said don't say it.”<br>
'''Nikki:''' ''[Giggles again]'' “We're doomed.”
----
''[Sameer and Nikki walk along looking for their friend]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' “Casey!”<br>
'''Nikki:''' “Bro!” ''[There's a hissing and the two are approached by a giant spider. They yelp]'' “Wait, it's cool, I have a spell for this.” ''[Gets out her spellbook and reads]'' “Half a cup of butter. Porcini mushrooms.” ''[Realizes and groans]'' “This is my mom's cookbook.”<br>
''[The spider hisses at them again and they run out of the cemetery in tears]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' “I'm gonna need more underwear!”
----
''[In another part of the cemetery, the crows starts cawing, the fog rolls in, and the three remaining friends hold each other]''<br>
'''Laird:''' “Why am I here? I don't care about breaking records. I care about normal things, like making my bed, scrapbooking and doing the Sunday crossword with Grandpa Mervin.”<br>
'''Sid:''' “It's OK, Laird, it's just fog. Plus, Gail is looking out for…”<br>
''[Gail returns and hoots twice]''<br>
'''Laird:''' “You heard the bird! Run!”<br>
''[Laird makes a run for it]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Laird! Wait!”<br>
'''Sid:''' “Maybe we should go too.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “We can't go. We have to find the others and make history.”<br>
''[They hear more noises and see the zombie, spider and skeleton approaching. They grab each other and scream]''<br>
'''Sid:''' “Can we make history for the shortest time here?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Done!”<br>
''[And on that note, the remaining two and the owl all run away. Back in the cemetery, the spider zombie and skeleton are standing there]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “They're all gone.” ''[Takes the zombie mask off]'' “Adiosito.”<br>
''[Rosa takes off the spider mask and the skeleton is actually a string puppet being controlled by Sergio, who laughs. Vito comes out of the bushes with a fog machine and joins his friends]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' “We did it! Our record is safe! Forty years and going strong. Now we can eat.”<br>
''[Takes out a tamale in all eight hands]''<br>
'''Vito:''' “No one dethrones the fearless four!”<br>
''[The geezers all laugh in triumph]''
----
''[The next morning, Carlos and Maria are on the couch and Sid and Ronnie Anne are on the floor. Hector, Rosa and Sergio innocently walk in]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “How was your, uh, night in the cemetery, muchachas?”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “Did you, um, make history?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “No, it might have been the scariest night of my life.”<br>
'''Sid:''' “I may never sleep again.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “You were right, it was too scary okay.”<br>
'''Sid:''' “We didn;t even make it until midnight.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' “Tell me about it.”<br>
''[Rosa shuts Sergio's beak]''<br>
'''Carlos:''' “It's okay, Ronnie Anne, at least you lasted longer than your mom.”<br>
''[Maria gets annoyed and throws Carlos' glasses across the room. He goes to get them]''<br>
'''Sid:''' “Anyway, tonight is gonne be different.”<br>
'''Rosa, Hector & Sergio:''' “Wait, what?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Yeah, we're all going back to try again.”<br>
'''Rosa, Hector & Sergio:''' “Wait, what?”<br>
'''Maria:''' “Come, mija, we can help you two pack up.”<br>
''[She and Carlos take the girls away]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' “These kids are tougher than we thought. Andale, let's get ready for round two. And make it even scarier.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “Hope they pack their chonies.”<br>
''[They all laugh diabolically. And are joined by Vito, out of nowhere]''<br>
'''Vito:''' “Hey, what are we's laughing about?”
----
''[That night, back at the cemetery, the six friends are setting up there tent]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Everyone got their safety gear?”<br>
'''Sid:''' “Gail's ready.”<br>
'''Casey:''' “Goggle's on.”<br>
'''Nikki:''' “Spell book, check.”<br>
'''Sameer:''' “Extra undies.” ''[Holds up six pairs]''<br>
'''Laird:''' “And I'm wearing diapers.”<br>
''[Everyone is just disturbed by this. Gail hoots]''<br>
'''Sid:''' “Even Gail brought his own safety blanket.”<br>
''[Gail holds it out and sucks his talon while holding it]''<br>
'''Laird:''' “I knew we had a connection.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Remember, we stick together and we're not leaving for anything tonight.”<br>
''[Everyone agrees and they all go into the tent. In the bushes nearby, the fearless four are getting ready]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “Okay, Vito, time to start howling.”<br>
''[Vito gargles some water, spits it out, and clears his throat. He's about to howl, when someone else does it first]''<br>
'''Vito:''' “Hey, oh, that's my line.”<br>
'''Hector:''' “Wasn't me.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Aye, it's just the wind. Come on, Vito.”<br>
''[He clears his throat, and they hear the howling again]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “Aye, madrecita.”<br>
'''Vito:''' “Ah, what's that!” ''[Jumps into Hector's arms]'' “Hold me!”<br>
'''Hector:''' “Vito, calm down. There's nothing to be afraid of.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Freaks out]'' “Except that guy!”<br>
''[A vampire sits up out of a coffin and hisses. The fearless four scream]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “Run!”<br>
'''Vito:''' “Forget this place.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' ''[Grabs them]'' “Comares! We can't just leave!” ''[Rips off the spider costume]'' “We have to save the children.”<br>
''[Inside the tent, the kids are a little scared, but especially freak out when Rosa rips the tent out of the ground]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Abuela?!”<br>
'''Hector:''' “Come on Mija! We have to run!”<br>
''[Everyone runs for it]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “What are you all doing here?! What's going on?!”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “We'll explain later. Hurry, the cemetery is alive!”<br>
''[The vampire is still chasing them, the kids see this and freak out]''<br>
'''Sameer:''' “Oh man!” ''[Starts throwing the extra underwear out of his pants, which Nikki has to duck under]'' ”There's not enough underwear in the world for this!”<br>
'''Nikki:''' ''[Gets her book out]'' “I definitely got the spellbook this time.” ''[looks]'' “The mitochondria is the powerhouse of a cell.” ''[Groans]'' “That's my science book!”<br>
''[Throws it away. It knocks the blankie away from Gail, which lands on Vito]''<br>
'''Vito:''' “Ooh! Hey! Help! Who turned out the lights?!” ''[Falls into a grave]'' “My bombito.”<br>
''[The vampire is still chasing them]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Quick, let's hide in this crypt.” ''[They all run inside]'' “I think we're safe in here.”<br>
''[There's a growling behind her and a werewolf pops out]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “No, we're not.” ''[Pushes everyone out “Move! ¡Ándale! ¡Ándale!”<br>
''[The vampire is blocking the exit. Seeing that they're trapped everyone screams. The wolf growls and comes closer. Hector, and Rosa, who is holding Sergio, are prepared to sacrifice themselves]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Take us! Not the niños!”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Tries to fly free, squawks]'' “Speak for yourself!”<br>
''[The kids start laughing, except for Laird]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “What's wrong with you kids? How can you laugh right now?”<br>
''[The vampire says something]''<br>
'''Maria:''' “Because payback is sweet.”<br>
''[The vampire and werewolf get closer and take their masks off, revealing to be Rosa and Hector's hija and hijo]''<br>
'''Everyone Except Laird:''' “We got you!”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Que? What's going on here?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “We know it was you scaring us, we figured it out last night.” ''[Flashback to the Casagrande apartment where Maria is comforting her hija]'' “Mom, it was so scary. There was a skeleton and a zombie and a spider!”<br>
'''Maria:''' “It's okay, mija.” ''[She and Carlos realize something]'' “Wait... Carlos, isn't that what scared us when we were kids?”<br>
'''Carlos:''' “It is.”<br>
'''Sid:''' ''[Eating a tamale]'' “It was so scary, I'm not gonna sleep for weeks.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Sid, where'd you get that tamale?”<br>
'''Sid:''' “The spider dropped it.”<br>
''[The wrapper reads 'MADE BY ROSA'. Carlos, Maria and Ronnie Anne gasp, followed by Sid, who keeps eating. End of flashback]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “Rosa, your tamales gave us away.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “You weren't complaining when you were stuffing your face.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Anyway, we realized it was you who scared us.”<br>
'''Carlos:''' “And us. I mean, uh, Maira.”<br>
'''Maria:''' “Oh you wish.”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “So my friends and I teamed up with Mom and Tío Carlos to get you guys back.”<br>
'''Laird:''' “We did?”<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “Laird, I thought you knew?”<br>
'''Laird:''' “No! No one tells me anything! I've been genuinely terrified all night.”<br>
'''Sid:''' “Gail, you were supposed to tell him.” ''[Gail shrugs]'' “He says, my bad.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “It's true, we didn't want our record broken.”<br>
'''Hector:''' “Maybe we were being too competitive. But you got us good kids.”<br>
'''Carlos:''' “And grown ups.”<br>
'''Hector:''' ''[Laughs]'' “Yeah, good job son.”<br>
'''Sergio:''' ''[Squawks]'' “I wasn't scared.” ''[Carlos holds the mask up again]'' “Mommy!” ''[Flies away]''<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Aye, it's late, let's go home.”<br>
''[Ronnie Anne opens the crypt, and sees that the sun is rising]''<br>
'''Ronnie Anne:''' “You mean early, look, we made it all night.”<br>
''[Everyone exits and sees that it's true]''<br>
'''Hector:''' “And we did it together.”<br>
'''Maria:''' ''[Laughs and starts noogying her hermano]'' “That's the only way Carlos could have done it.”<br>
'''Rosa:''' “Now all three generations have made it into the history books.”<br>
'''Hector:''' “The fearless four become the fearless twelve.”<br>
''[Suddenly a hand reaches out of a grave nearby. Everyone screams and runs for it. But the hand actually belongs to Vito, who was digging himself out of a grave. He looks around]''<br>
'''Vito:''' “How'd I get over here?”
