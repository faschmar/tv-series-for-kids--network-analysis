Hunter::: Whew! A ghost just ran into the bathroom! Tune in tomorrow when I flush him out!
Lincoln::: That.. was.. AWESOME! I'm so not gonna be able to sleep tonight!
Clyde::: Or go to the bathroom.
Lincoln:::  Oh no! I've missed curfew! If my parents find out I'm not home, they'll-
Clyde::: They'll blame me, and they won't let us be friends anymore! I'll be banned from your house!  I never got to say goodbye to Lori. I need you to tell her some things. Number 1, she made me a better man.
Lincoln:::  Lori, I've lost track of time!
Lori::: Don't worry, we've got your back. Okay people, Operation Cover For Brother is a go!
Lynn::: Man your stations!
Rita::: I told Lincoln I'd help him with his math homework.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh. I'll be your plus one.  You get it?
Rita::: Oh yeah.
Lola::: IT'S MINE!
Lana::: HEY, I HAD IT FIRST!
Lola::: YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE YARN!
Lynn Sr.::: GIRLS!  This is so wrong!
Clyde:::  Number 2, tell Lori I remember every dress she ever wore.
Rita::: No more fighting!
Lana:::  OKAY, MOM AND DAD! I GUESS YOU'RE GOING TO HELP LINCOLN WITH HIS HOMEWORK THEN!
Luna:::  Hey, 'rents, know what I'm Jonesin' for? A family sing-along! One, two, three!
Lisa:::  Approach at a 63 degree angle!
Lisa::: Correction, 62 degrees.
Leni:::  Hi, parentals. We were just wondering how you two met.
Rita::: Really? Your father has told that story a thousand times.
Lynn Sr.::: Now, now, honey. If they insist.
Lynn Sr.::: ...and then your mother walked by in an outfit that could stop traffic.
Rita:::  It was my uniform. I was a crossing guard.
Rita::: Linc? Are you okay? We're coming in.
Rita:::  Oh, sweetie, what's the matter?
Lincoln:::  Thus, the trains will pass each other at precisely 4:00 PM. Homework done.
Rita::: Looks like you don't need our help.
Lincoln:::  One of the great things about having a big family is someone's always got your back. I know I can count on my sisters to save my butt, and they can count on me.
Lynn Sr.:::  Was he wearing a helmet?
Rita::: KIDS, COME ON DOWN! I HOPE YOU DIDN'T FORGET WHAT TODAY IS!
Rita::: That's right; our annual Spring Cleaning Day! Who's excited?
Rita::: That's the spirit.
Lynn::: Hey, can you cover for me today? The batting cages got a new pitching machine, and if I don't hit the first ball, I'll have bad luck all season.
Lincoln::: I get that. Sure.
Lynn:::  Ah, thanks. I'll do my cleaning when I get back. 
Lori::: Lincoln, can you cover for me?  I'm bringing Lily on a picnic with Bobby to see how he handles babies.  You know, for the future.
Lincoln:::  Uh...I don't get that, but...sure.
Rita:::  Lori! Can you check on Lily?
Lincoln:::  I'm literally already on it!  Uh-oh! Who made a stinky surprise for her big sister?  Poo-poo! Poo-poo!
Leni:::  Lori, you changed your hair! And Lily's invisible now? Nobody tells me anything!
Lincoln:::  No, Leni, i-it's me, Lincoln. I'm covering for Lori and Lily.
Leni::: Oh. Then you won't mind covering for me while I hit the Spring sale at the mall.
Lincoln:::  Fine. But four sisters is my limit.
Leni:::  Of course. No more sisters. Oh! One thing: I'm covering for six sisters, so I guess now you are, too.
Lincoln:::  What?!
Leni:::  Don't worry. I wrote down where everyone's going. 
Lincoln::: One floral crop top. $12.99?  Oh.  Lucy's at a poetry reading, Lisa's giving a lecture, Lana's checking out the first mud of Spring...Leni, how am I supposed to-
Leni::: Thanks, Linky! Bye! 
Rita:::  Lucy? Lynn? How's the cleaning coming?
Lincoln:::  This calls for...the Trunk!  I scrub and scrub, yet the stain of human suffering remains.
Rita:::  Okay.
Lincoln:::  Not me, Mom! I'm knocking these dust balls out of the park!
Rita:::  Good to hear.  Leni, how's your spring cleaning coming?
Lincoln:::  Good! As soon as I find those springs, I'll clean them!
Lincoln::: Phew.
Lynn Sr.::: I HEAR A LOTTA TALKIN', BUT NOT A LOTTA CLEANIN'!
Lynn Sr.::: Ah, that's what I like to hear!
Lincoln:::  And they said it couldn't be done.
Rita:::  Time for a break, kids! Pop-Pop's on video chat! He wants to say hi to all of you!
Albert::: Well, if it isn't my lookalike. Still got snow on the roof, eh?
Lincoln:::  Sure do, Pop-Pop. We're all doing our spring cleaning, so the sisters nominated me to say hello.
Albert::: I tell ya, Spring always puts me in the mood for a song. Why don't you bring Luna down?
Lincoln:::  S.O.S Come Home Now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Lincoln:::  How I wonder what you are! Stage dive! 
Albert::: Bravo! Tough act to follow. But I'd love to see some comedy from Luan.
Lincoln:::  What does a nosy pepper do? Gets jalape√±o business!  Get it?
Albert:::  Hilarious! Now go get those twins!
Lincoln:::  I wanna talk to Pop-Pop first!  No, me first!
Albert::: Girls, girls, there's plenty of Pop-Pop for everyone.
Lincoln::: You can make fun of me later. Right now, I've got Pop-Pop on video chat and he wants to see all of us.
Lana::: I'll go say hi right now.
Lincoln::: Hello! I already was you.  And I was you, too. I need a Lynn and a Leni, stat!
Lana:::  ...And I got a new outfit for half off, which was weird because none of it was missing. Duh!
Lincoln::: Pop-Pop wants to talk to Lisa.
Lynn::: Lisa's not home yet.
Lincoln:::  She is now! Go!
Lynn:::  ...But I knew I was missing one key component and that was sodium...  ...uh...sofa-cushion!
Albert::: Bring me the, uh, the funny one again.
Albert::: Uh, I forgot to tell Lily something.
Albert::: No, it was Leni. Or was it Lisa?
Lincoln:::  Who are you supposed to be?
Lisa:::  Uh...Lan...cy?
Lori:::  So, Ace Savvy was like, HOO! HA! HUH!  And then One-Eyed Jack was all, HOO! HO! HA! 
Lola:::  Pop-Pop. White hair. New hip. Traction shoes. Never slip. Pop-Pop. 
Lucy:::  OMG, Pop-Pop, Bobby looked so cute, I literally forgot we were all hurdling toward imminent oblivion.
Lincoln:::  Poo-poo!
Lincoln::: I think that's it! We're done!
Lori::: Uh, nope. Pop-Pop wants to say bye to all of us. Together. Now!
Albert::: Well, you kids really made my day. Talk to ya soon.
Loud Kids Except Lily::: BYE, POP-POP!
Albert::: Oh, boy, that was great. Next time I must use my glasses.
Loud Kids:::  Phew. 
Lori::: Awesome!
Lincoln::: Guys, we did it! We actually-
Lynn Sr.::: Ahem!
Lynn Sr.::: You wanna tell us what's goin' on here?
Kids:::  Nothing!
Lynn Sr.::: Nice try. You're all busted!
Lori::: Mom, Dad, the truth is, we all had things we really wanted to do today, and so, we were covering for each other.
Luna::: But just for a little while.
Leni::: And we were totally going to do our Spring cleaning. Pinky swear.  Wait a minute.  Okay, there it is.
Lincoln::: I know this looks bad, but on the bright side, isn't it great how we all look out for each other?
Rita::: Yes, that is great, but deceiving people is not. So, here's what we're gonna do.  Spring cleaning will be moved to tomorrow so you can all do those things that were so important today.  There's just one catch. You all have to wear what you're wearing right now.
Lisa::: So, if you look at the coefficient on line five-
Dirty girl::: Uh-uh! No girly girls allowed!
Lana::: But, guys, it's me, Lana.
Leni::: But guys, it's me, Leni!
Bobby::: Babe, I got you this. But now I'm afraid it might be a choking hazard.
Lincoln:::  Well, I guess we all got what we deserved. But honestly, I got off easy. I'm just hanging out at home, watching ARGGH! with Clyde. 
Clyde:::  Uh...hey, buddy. I thought this episode was gonna be so awesome, why not invite our whole class? 
Lincoln:::  Oh, poo-poo.
