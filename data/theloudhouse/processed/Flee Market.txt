Bobby::: Thanks, Vito. Have a great day.
Vito::: I-I will if this itch cream works.
Bobby::: Oh...
Lori::: Eee! Boo-Boo Bear, how excited are you for our anniversary tomorrow?
Bobby::: So excited, babe! I can't wait to celebrate the first time we ever ate pizza together. Tia Frida even made me a special pizza tux.
Lori::: Aww, that's so romantic! You still wanna go to Gus's Games & Grub?
Bobby::: Of course! That's where it all started. Remember how we shared a large pepperoni?
Lori::: Oh, yeah. You bit into it and burned the left side of your tongue!
Bobby::: Oh, yeah! That hurt so bad. So, I'll pick you up tomorrow?
Lori::: Can't wait. Bye, Boo-Boo Bear!
Bobby::: Abuelo! Just the man I needed to see. Lori and I are celebrating our pizza-versary tomorrow. Can you cover my shift? 
Hector::: I'm sorry, Roberto, but I'll be at the Big Mercado Convention.  This year, they're giving out door chimes! 
Bobby::: Oh, well, you don't wanna miss that. I'll just have to break it to Lori, and Tia Frida. She was really excited about the pizza tux. 
Hector::: Don't be ridiculous! Go see Lori! There are plenty of people in this family who can watch the Mercado. 
Bobby::: Are there? 
Bobby::: No swordfighting with the jerky! 
Hector::: Niños, Roberto needs a favor. Can you watch the mercado for him tomorrow so he can celebrate Lori's pizza birthday? 
Bobby::: Pizza-versary, abuelo! 
Carl:::  Sure! I love working here! 
Bobby::: No! You love eating all the candy and getting everything sticky!  
Bobby::: Are you sure we can trust them to handle it? The Mercado's a big responsibility. 
Hector::: They'll be fine, Bobby. The Mercado is in their blood. 
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, new game! Piñata racing! 
Bobby:::  Aw...
Carl::: What are you wearing? 
Bobby::: What? Haven't you ever seen a pizza tux?  Now listen carefully. When the new milk is delivered, put it behind the old milk, and face the carton so the date can be clearly read. 
Bobby::: Hey! Put those back! Now, there's a lot more you need to know, so I put it in this quick reference guide. 
Carl::: Look! I'm reading it right now! 
Bobby::: That's it! I'm staying here! 
Ronnie Anne::: Bobby, go! You're gonna be late. We got this. 
Carl::: Yeah. I could run this place in my sleep. People bring groceries to the counter, we take their money, I eat a fist full of Chewy Chewies. 
Bobby::: That you buy at the employee discount rate? 
Ronnie Anne::: Goodbye, Bobby! 
Bobby::: I'm comin', babe! Oh no! I forgot to tell them something.  Phone, call Ronnie Anne. 
Carl::: Huh? 
Ronnie Anne::: Hey Bobby, what's up? 
Bobby:::  I forgot to tell you. The restrooms are for customers only. They gotta buy something. 
Ronnie Anne::: That's why you called? OK, I think we got it, Bobby. Adios. 
Ronnie Anne::: What now? 
Bobby::: If anyone comes in for walnuts- 
Carl::: No one will! Walnuts are the worst nut! 
Par::: Ah, hey guys! Where do you want these mangoes? Just gettin' in a quick set! 
Ronnie Anne::: Thanks Par. Just set them by the fish. 
Bobby::: No! Not by the fish! They'll absorb the fish smell. And don't let Par do any more exercises with the fruit. 
Ronnie Anne::: Bobby, quit worrying. We've got this. 
Bobby::: I'll just do a visual check in, yeah. 
Bobby::: Ugh! I told Maybelle she can't just sample the grapes like that. 
Bobby::: Yes! Yes! 
Carl::: Yeah! Ha-ha! 
Ronnie Anne::: One guess who it is.  
Bobby::: Hey! I told you to stay away from those Chewy Chewies! There better be 97 when I get back! 
Ronnie Anne::: Huh? 
Bobby::: And you have a code purple! Maybelle is eating grapes! 
Ronnie Anne::: How do you know all of that? 
Bobby::: Uh... Mercado instinct! Hey, did you change my music? Bobby's Mercado Mix Number 7 was carefully selected to stimulate more shopping. 
Ronnie Anne::: Mercado instinct, huh? More like you're spying on us with the security camera!
Bobby::: Wait! I'm not spying! What... What are you doing?!
Bobby::: They cut me off! What am I gonna do?
Bobby:::  A hundred people live here and no one answers the door? 
Lori:::  Hi, Boo Boo Bear. Ooh, cute tux! It goes great with my side salad scarf. 
Bobby::: Come on babe, no time to waste!  
Lori::: Ooh, I love this new take  charge attitude.  
Lori::: Uh wait, where are we going? Gus' is that way. 
Bobby::: Surprise! I'm going to take you to the best pizza place in the city. Nothing's too good for my little garlic knot. 
Lori::: Aww... 
Bobby::: Why don't you find us a table while I park the van? BRBB. 
Lori::: Be right back. What's the extra 'B' for? 
Bobby::: Babe. 
Ronnie Anne::: Bobby?
Bobby::: That's right!  I don't appreciate being cut off!  Yuck! From communication!
Ronnie Anne::: Well, we didn't appreciate you spying on us. We've all helped out here and know what to do. Look around! Nothing went wrong.
Bobby::: How can you say that?! The mangos smell like trout! The milk is facing the wrong way! This can is off by a centimeter!
Ronnie Anne::: You're being so picky! That stuff doesn't matter!
Bobby::: It matters to me! I don't need a bunch of kids coming in here and changing everything! You'll understand when you're older!
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, ho, ho! I think we understand now! You're just like a Mercado run in a very specific way!  So, run it yourself! 
Carl:::   Yeah, we quit! 
CJ:::  We're done! 
Carl::: Later, jefe. 
Bobby:::  Now what? I can't close the mercado. Par's gonna need his post-workout protein bar soon. And, Mr. Chang's gonna need his coffee for his night shift. Plus, Lori's waiting on me...  Oh no, Lori!  Maybelle, I'll be right back. 
Maybelle:::  Take your time!
Bobby::: Sorry it took so long, babe. 
Lori:::  Anyway, I was thinking we could get half cheese and half pepperoni. 
Bobby::: Oh! Cashews cost a fortune! 
Lori::: I-I said cheese. 
Bobby::: Oh, great. Let's- Let's just get that done.  What's this? One dinky flower?  My babe deserves a bouquet. BRBB with a B. The last B is for 'bouquet'. 
Maybelle::: You know, Bobby, we don't have time to be waitin' around for you like this. 
Vito:::  Ah, yeah. I need more itch cream! 
Bobby::: So sorry, it won't happen again. So, that'll be 12 dollars for all the cashews you ate, and... 
Maybelle::: Wait! This mango has a bruise. Let me pick out a new one. It's still my turn, no cutsies. 
Lori (imagination)::: Bobby, where are you? 
Lori (imagination)::: Bobby, you are literally making me wait! 
Vito (imagined as a pizza)::: You're sweating a lot. 
Bobby:::  Oh! You know what? I'll BRBB! 
Maybelle::: You'll what? 
Bobby::: Be right back ba...by powder is on aisle three.  Oh, no, wait, flowers, ah! 
Bobby::: There! That's better. 
Lori::: That's broccoli. Are you okay? 
Bobby::: Oh, oh yeah, yeah, I-I'm just excited for our date. 
Lori::: Well, the food got here. Try this. 
Bobby::: Sorry, babe. My... pepperoni cufflinks are coming off. Be right back!  
Bobby::: Ah! 
Maybelle::: See, Bobby? Look at this mango! It's perfect. All right, quit standin' in there, you're gonna overripe it! 
Lori:::  I KNEW IT!!! You were with your other love on our ANNIVERSARY?! 
Bobby::: No! Maybelle and I are just friends. 
Maybelle::: Maybe if I was, fifty years younger. 
Lori::: I mean the Mercado, Bobby! ARRGH!! 
Bobby::: No, Lo-Lo-Lori!  LORI!!!  Babe! I'm sorry. I didn't mean for tonight to turn out like this. 
Lori::: I can't believe you drove me all the way to the city just so you could work on our anniversary! 
Bobby::: That wasn't the plan! It was supposed to be a really special night. I left Ronnie Anne, Carl, and CJ in charge of the Mercado, but they were messing things up. They changed the music to K-pop, and they put the mangos by the fish?! 
Lori::: That's it? So they didn't upset any customers? Burn the place down? 
Bobby::: No, but- 
Lori::: Bobby, everyone in your family cares about the Mercado. No one would ever let anything truly bad happen to it. 
Bobby::: Right, but- 
Lori::: Maybe, they have their own way of doing things, and you just need to trust them. 
Bobby:::  You're right. I'm sorry. I guess I do have a hard time giving up control of the Mercado. 
Lori:::  It's okay. You're just, really passionate about what you do, and I love that about you. Also, you look really cute on your pizza tux. 
Bobby::: Thanks, babe. Let me make this night up for you. BRBB. 
Lori::: Ugh... 
Bobby::: Last one! 
Movie Character::: There's only one way to stop this chupacabra. And that is- 
Carl::: Now we'll never know! 
Bobby::: Guys, I'm sorry for not trusting you to watch the Mercado. You did a great job. You think we could have a do-over so I can take Lori to dinner? I promise not to spy on you. Unlimited Chewy Chewies... 
CJ (simultaneous):::  I'll do it! 
Carl (simultaneous):::  I'm in! 
Bobby::: And Ronnie Anne, you can listen to whatever you want. Blast that K-pop! 
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, deal. But where are you gonna take her this late? The pizza place is closed. 
Bobby::: Hmm... Ah!
Lori::: Oh, Boo Boo Bear, this is so romantic, and these pizza tacos your Abuela made, are delicious.  
Bobby::: Thanks, babe. I'm just glad we're finally celebrating our pizza-versary the way you deserve! 
Lori::: Thanks, Boo Boo Bear. Literally, best pizza-versary ever! 
Bobby::: Uh-oh! Maybe Tia Frida shouldn't have used real pepperonis.
