Lynn Sr.::: It's here, it's here, IT'S HERE!  Can you believe it? First thing I've ever won!
Lola::: Fancy.
Lynn Sr.:::  Isn't it beautiful?  AAH! Charles, no!  Ding dang darn it, my brand new chair!  Agh! Come on, you're getting a bath, mister! 
Lucy::: Gasp.
Rita:::  Freeze! Nobody touch it.
Lucy::: Why?
Rita::: Really? You have to ask?
Lynn Sr.:::  Has anyone seen my Father's Day spatula?!
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, there's that remote!
Lynn::: Hey Dad, just getting her warmed up for ya.
Lynn Sr.::: Don't worry, LJ! I'm coming for ya!
Rita:::  That goes for you too, little lady. 
Lily:::  Hmph!
Game::: Game over. You lose.
Chair::: Lincoln, come, sit on me! I'm way comfier than that old couch.
Lincoln:::  Maybe a quick seat wouldn't hurt.
Lincoln::: Oh no! I got pizza grease all over Dad's new chair!  I gotta clean the chair.  D'oh!  I can't believe this!
Lynn::: What a run. I need an ice bath.  Or maybe I just need a massage.  Let's crank this up to eleven.
Lisa::: Now where's a copper-plated circuit unit when you need one?  Oh, perfect. 
Rita::: Kids, Dream Boat<nowiki>'</nowiki>s on! Dad'll be home any minute.
Lana::: Yeah...
Lucy::: Groan.
Lynn Sr.:::  Alright! Who's ready for Dream Boat?! Haha!
Leni::: Wait!
Lincoln::: Stop!
Lana::: Pop, no!
Lola::: No, no no no!
Lynn Sr.:::  My chair! What happened?!  Then how do you explain this?! 
Rita::: Wow, kids, I am disappointed in all of you.
Lynn Sr.:::  Don't even try it, Rita.  I found your manuscript in there, too.  How could you?!  It's the only thing I've ever wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-oooon! 
Lynn Sr.:::  I miss you so much...
Lincoln::: Hey Dad, we wanted to say sorry for what we did to your chair.
Lynn Sr.::: Ha!  My chair! 
Lana::: Yup! Lisa and I took it to the shop and did a quick repair job.
Lori::: And in the future, we promise not to destroy the things you love.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, kids.  In the future, I promise not to get so emotional over a silly chair. Thank you. Aww, get in here.
Lisa::: Father, I do think you'll enjoy the upgrades I installed.  Guess it still has a few kinks.
