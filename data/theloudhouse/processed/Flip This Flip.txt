Flip::: OK, call her.  I, uh, I changed my mind! Hang up!  Hoo, OK, I'm good. Call her.  Nope! Hang up! Hang up! 
Lincoln::: Uh, what's going on?
Lana::: OK, from what I understand- my raccoon's a little rusty- the lady on the framed turkey label is Flip's old middle school crush, um... Tommy Hogglesfort?
Flip::: Tammy Gobblesworth!  My one true love. I always thought she and I would eat food off of other people's plates together forever. ] But then I got locked out of the school dance and missed my one shot to impress her.
Lana:::  Ever since Flip found the label, he's been attempting to call and ask her to dinner, but he keeps chickening out.
Flip::: Hey, chickening out is a bit harsh.
Lincoln::: Flip, you can totally do this. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Lana::: Yeah. You're Flip Phillipini. You're a legend!
Flip:::  Oh, I suppose I am pretty Flip-tastic. OK, gimme that phone!
Tammy::: Gobblesworth Farms, how can I help you?
Flip::: Tammy Gobblesworth, please. Tell her it's Philip Phillipini calling.
Tammy::: Philip Phillipini? What a wonderful surprise! I am gobble-smacked!
Tammy::: Hello? Philip? Are you there?
Lincoln::: Flip, say something!
Tammy::: Hello?
Lincoln:::  Uh, you bet it's old Flip- uh, Philip!  What's shakin', eggs and bacon?  Hey, you wanna catch up over some grub? Say, tomorrow night at Lynn's Table, 7 o'clock!
Tammy:::  Oh, I'd love to! Gobble-gobble!
Flip::: Eh, sorry, Loudies. I panicked and the old word-maker shut down. You saved my butt. I'm not much of a hugger, so, uh,  here's some beef jerky.  My way of saying thanks.  Yeah, I'll give you some, too.
Announcer::: Welcome to Flip This Dump, where we take buildings that are complete disasters and make them shiny and new again.
Lincoln::: The word 'flip' makes me think of yesterday.
Lana::: It was cool seeing Flip so happy.
Lincoln and Lana:::  FLIP?!
Flip::: Why would you kids make me think I could go on a date with Tammy Gobblesworth?!
Lincoln::: Uh, why not? You were so excited yesterday!
Flip::: Yeah, and then I read this article about her on Tycoon Monthly!  She's fashionable, smart, and glamorous! She'll take a look at me and run for the hills!
Leni:::  I heard someone say fashionable!
Lisa::: I heard smart!
Lola:::  And I heard glamorous!
Flip::: Please, you gotta help me. I need to be presentable if I'm going on this date.
Lincoln::: Don't worry, Flip. You can count on us, right, guys?
Lincoln:::  Welcome to Flip This Flip, where we take people that are complete disasters and make them shiny and new. Let's meet our panel of experts.
Lana:::  Lana: Hygiene. 
Leni::: Leni: Fashion. 
Lola::: Lola:  Etiquette.
Lisa:::  Lisa: Interesting Conversation.
Lincoln::: Lincoln: Transportation.  What? You guys took all the good categories.
Lana:::  Usually I am opposed to baths, but I understand you gotta make a good first impression. 
Flip::: Ooh!
Lana::: Very nice. Lemme get you a towel.
Flip::: So you're gonna give me things to talk about with Tammy?
Lisa::: Let's keep this simple. Just talk about the weather and wear these fashionable, yet technologically advanced socks. 
Flip::: Oooh, what do these babies do? Eh, never mind. If they hide my bunions and hammer toes, it's a job well done.
Lola::: Today, Flip, we're gonna get you ready for dinner with Tammy, and we're gonna have fun doing it.  SIT UP STRAIGHT! FEET ON THE FLOOR! ELBOWS OFF THE TABLE!  Now which one is the salad fork?!
Flip:::  Oh, uh, is it the, uh... 
Lola:::  I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY, GRUNT!
Leni:::  OK, Flip, let's see the outfit options. Dazzle me!  Uh-uh.  Eugh.  Ugh. 
Leni:::  Presenting the new and totes flipped...
Leni, Lisa, and Twins::: Philip Phillipini!
Lincoln::: Flip, you look amazing!
Flip::: And check out these conversation-starting socks from brainy Loud!
Leni::: Socks? That's fashion! Lisa, you could have at least consulted with-  I TOTES APPROVE!
Lincoln:::  Why would you give him socks?
Lisa::: Just trust me.
Lincoln::: Flip, your rented chariot awaits.
Lisa::: Best of luck to you on this momentous evening, Flip.
Flip::: Hold the cheese! Yeah, I need you gals on the date with me! Come on, if you're not there by ol' Flip, I'll wreck everything!
Leni::: OK, we'll come.
Flip::: Aw, you're the best, Loudies. 
Lana:::  Jerky. It's how he says thank you.
Flip::: She was supposed to be here by now! She's not coming; I know it!  It's her... 
Lincoln::: Oh no! Flip's frozen!
Lisa::: Relax. I anticipated this.
Lincoln::: Tickle socks? You're a genius!
Lisa:::  Tell me something mentioned that the Nobel committee and I don't know.
Flip::: Oh, hey there, Tammy. How about this weather, huh? It's so humid I'm pittin' by 9:00 AM!  Uh, I mean, uh, it's the pits!
Tammy::: Look at you! You've changed so much since middle school I almost didn't recognize you!
Lola:::  Yes, isn't Philip sophisticated? Now let's eat before he blows everything- I mean, can I tell you tonight's specials?
Flip:::  And now onto the extra-classy second part of the date: The opera!
Tammy::: Oh, how lovely!
Lincoln::: It's been 20 minutes and everything's going well.
Lisa::: Uh, negatory. Old Flip has resurfaced.  And he has a beach ball.
Lana::: I'm on it.
Flip::: Oof!
Lincoln::: OK, Flip seems focused and quiet.
Leni::: Yeah, the only noise is from that yelly lady in the horn hat.
Lana::: Guys, Flip's quiet because he's asleep! He's gonna snore and ruin everything!
Lisa::: Ah-ah-ah-ah. Let me get my money's worth out of those socks. 
Flip:::  AH! I didn't eat the hot dog; it was Santa!  Oh, um, I mean, would you like some popcorn, Tammy?
Tammy::: Mmm-hmm!
Flip::: I'll be right back!
Lisa::: Oh, dear.
Lincoln::: Sorry about that. We'll be right back.
Flip:::  Ah, you did your best, Loudsters. I blew it with Tammy.
Lana:::  Blew it! Yes!
Tammy::: Oh, Philip, are you OK? And where are your pants?!
Flip:::  OK, I gotta level with you, Tammy. I'm not a fancy, tuxedo-wearing guy who oozes sophistication. The only thing I ooze is nacho cheese! Seriously, my sweat is orange. I was only trying to impress you because you're so classy and glamorous. I'm not classy, I'm just gassy!
Tammy:::  Oh, now this is the Philip I remember. The one I missed.
Flip::: Really? Oh, what's the point? We got nothing in common.
Tammy::: Well, we actually have more in common than you think. Y'know, all that glitz and glamor, it's just for the magazines. You know, I got turkeys to sell. But when I'm at home, I'm more like this.  Well, this is the real me!  I was late for dinner because when I got to the restaurant I saw you all gussied up and went home to change. I was trying to impress you, too.
Flip:::  Boy, we're a couple of ding-dongs, huh? Hey, look, why don't we start the date over at the Food & Fuel? We could sit on my dumpster lid and look up at the stars. I'd say we could have some jerky, too, but I'm all out.  I had a lot of people to thank today.
Flip::: OK, on 3, your favorite thing to do on Sundays. 1, 2, 3.
Flip and Tammy::: LICK THE FROSTING OFF BAKERY CUPCAKES WHEN NO ONE IS LOOKING! 
Tammy::: Hey, Phillipini, remember this? 
Flip::: Boy, do I?! Hey, remember this? 
Tammy::: Oh, I've missed that sweet harmony!
Lola::: This is the grossest thing I've ever seen.
Leni::: It's totes weird, but kinda sweet.
Tammy::: Oh, I'm glad you called, Philip Phillipini.
Flip::: Actually, call me Flip. And I'm glad I called, too, Tammy Gobblesworth. You always leave me gobble-smacked.
Lincoln:::  Next time, I'm hiring a limo.
