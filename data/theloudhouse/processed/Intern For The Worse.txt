Lincoln:::  Today is the Fifth Grade Internship Fair and Clyde and I are making sure to put our best foot forward.
Lincoln::: 'Cause there's only one place we wanna work.
Both::: FLIP'S FOOD & FUEL!
Flip::: 
Clyde::: Good morrow, fine sir. I'm Clyde McBride and this is my associate, Lincoln Loud. Together, we're known as...
Both::: Clincoln McCloud!
Clyde::: We're a team! 
Lincoln::: We'd love the opportunity to work at your fine establishment...
Both::: As a team!
Flip::: Two for one? Now, you're speaking Flip's language!
Clyde:::  If you peruse our joint resume, I think you'll find-
Flip:::  Never mind that! Either of you got a criminal record?
Clyde and Lincoln::: No.
Flip::: You're hired!
Clyde and Lincoln:::  Woo hoo!
Lincoln::: We'll get to see where the nacho cheese comes from!
Clyde::: And read the comics as soon as they're delivered!
Lincoln::: And use the Flippee machine!
Both:::  Oooh! Flippees!
Flip::: Hey, Stinkoln McFartCloud! Your internship started ten seconds ago! 
Flip:::  See, boys? Across and down! That's the technique.  Now it's your turn.
Lincoln:::  But, we're out of window cleaner. Should I go in the store and get some?
Flip::: You kiddin' me? That stuff costs forty cents a gallon! Here. 
Flip::: Okay, we've covered the cash register, the gas pumps, and stacking the jerky. Last thing you need to know is how to adjust the expiration date.  There we go! Now, it's good 'till Christmas.
Clyde::: Isn't that against the law?
Flip::: Did I say it was time for a Q&A?
Flip::: Now, do you boys think you're ready to take charge?
Lincoln and Clyde:::  You bet, sir!
Flip::: Good. As an extra incentive, whoever's doing the best job is gonna get promoted to manager! I'll be in the back.  But, Flip's eyes and ears are everywhere!  So, put on a good show, huh? 
Lincoln::: But, we're a team. I don't wanna be your manager.
Clyde::: Me neither. We're Clincoln McCloud.
Flip:::  Oh, I forgot one thing.  The manager gets the unlimited free Flippee cup! 
Lincoln::: Free Flippees? Big deal. Who cares?
Clyde::: Yeah, what kind of team would we be if we let something as petty as an endless supply of the sweetest, tastiest, frostiest-  What was I saying?
Lincoln::: That we're not going to let anything come between us.
Clyde::: Right.
Lincoln:::  I'm just gonna wipe down this counter.
Clyde:::  And I'm just gonna clean off this case.
Both::: Welcome to Flip's! How can I help you?
Lola:::  You can get out of my way. I need to make a tinkle.
Lana::: You can help me! Fill 'er up! Premium unleaded!
Lincoln:::  I'm on it.  Gas for your car...  ...and gas for you.
Lana:::  Ooh! Beef Jerky? Sweet!  Keep up the good work, brother! 
Lola:::  Ugh! How is anyone supposed to tinkle in there? It. Is. Disgusting!
Clyde::: I'm on it! 
Lola:::  Clyde! The powder room was a delight! Five stars. Much better.
Lincoln and Clyde::: Have a Flippee day!
Lola and Lana:::  Keep up the good work, boys!
Lincoln::: Look. I want you to know I'm not trying to compete with you. I was just helping a customer.
Clyde::: Oh, totally. Same with me.  Clincoln McCloud! We're a team.
Mrs. Jelinsky::: Ugh, darn thing is on the fritz.
Lincoln and Clyde::: I'm on it!  At your service, ma'am!
Lincoln::: What's the trouble?
Mrs. Jelinsky::: Your microwave is broken, leaving me as cold as my burrito.
Clyde:::  I can heat this up for you in a jiffy.
Mrs. Jelinsky::: I thought you said a jiffy.
Lincoln:::  Allow me!
Lincoln::: Give her some gas, mam!
Mrs. Jelinsky:::  What a good little employee! 
Lincoln::: Have a Flippee day!  Sorry for butting in, but, again, just trying to help the customer.
Clyde::: Oh, no. Of course.
Darin McGowan::: Does anybody work here? I'd like to buy some gas station pizza!
Lincoln:::  I'm on it! You can help the next customer, partner. 
Clyde::: But...
Girl Athletes::: 
Lynn:::  Got a massive order for ya, Clydesdale. 
Clyde::: I'm on it!
Lincoln:::  Hey, partner! Looks like you could use an assist.
Clyde::: Oh, no, I've got this, partner.  You can help the next customer.
Girl Athletes::: Oh, thanks Clyde! You're the best!
Clyde::: No problem, ladies!  Just doin' my job.
Margo:::  Yeah, yeah. Can you hold my dog, Lynnsanity? I gotta take a wicked dump!
Lynn::: No, Margo. You cannot go number two until we are number one.
Flip::: Interns assemble!
Flip::: I've made my decision about which of you to promote to manager.
Lincoln and Clyde::: Who is it? Who is it?
Flip::: Eh, you're both showin' some good hustle, but I'm going to give the edge to... McBride!
Clyde::: Yes!
Flip::: Congratulations! 
Lincoln::: I knew you were competing with me!
Clyde::: Well you were competing, too! You swiped that burrito right out of my hands, burrito swiper.
Lincoln::: You're the one who was showing off with the bathroom cleaning! Potpourri? Seriously?
Clyde::: It provides a soothing environment for our customers, and I won't apologize for that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an unlimited free Flippee cup to fill.  And refill. 
Lincoln:::  It's not fair, Flip! I've been working just as hard as Clyde.  That cup should be mine.
Flip::: I hear what you're sayin', chief. Uh, you know, I do happen to have an opening for a supervising manager. Technically the cup would go to him.  But, you're gonna have to show me you deserve the gig.
Lincoln::: What do I have to do? I'll do anything!
Lincoln::: Ugh. I think I found the clog. 
Flip::: There's my missin' sock!  No sense in wastin' good cheese.
Clyde:::  Ah...
Flip:::  Sorry, chief. We're doing some restructuring.  Say hello to your new supervising manager!
Flip::: I hear what you're sayin' chief. You know, I do happen to have another position available. Senior supervising manager.  You'd get your cup back.
Clyde::: What do I have to do? I'll do anything!
Clyde::: Hey! 
Flip::: Oh, yeah. That's nice.
Lincoln:::  Ah, too many Flippees! Gotta pee!
Clyde::: Wait! I have to go, too! Gimme that key!
Lincoln::: Sorry. I got first dibs. Don't forget. I'm Executive Senior Supervising Manager.
Clyde::: Yeah, but I'm Senior Executive Supervising Manager. I outrank you.
Lincoln::: Nuh-uh!
Clyde::: Yuh-huh! I had it first!
Lincoln::: Come on! I'm warning you!
Lincoln::: Let go! I had it first!
Lincoln::: Let go!
Clyde::: No way, man! I've had it with you. YOU'RE FIRED!
Lincoln::: You can't fire me! I'm firing you!
Flip::: Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure, sure. I can go fishin'. I got two bozo interns workin' their tails off, tryin' to get promoted.  Amazing what a kid will do for free Flippees. 
Clyde::: Holy nachos! Flip's been playing us for fools! I'm really sorry, Lincoln. I let my love of Flippees get in the way of our friendship.
Lincoln::: Me, too, Clyde. Can we please go back to being Clincoln McCloud?
Clyde::: You know it, buddy.
Lincoln::: And now that we're a team again, I think I know how to spend the last few hours of our internship.
Clyde::: Updating our joint resume?
Lincoln:::  Nope. Better.
Flip::: Oh, interns! I've got a special taxidermy job for one of you!  There's a promotion in it!
Lincoln::: Uh, sorry, Flip. We've done a little restructuring. And from now on, we're calling the shots.
Flip::: I think all those Flippees have given you brain freeze. Back to work, boys!
Lincoln::: Shall we show him, Clincoln?
Clyde::: Indeed, McCloud.
Lincoln::: Thanks to our senior positions, we had access to all the store security footage.
Clyde::: And we'd hate to see this get on the internet.
October 15, 12:::10 PM: He drinks from a carton of milk and spits it out knowing it's expired, seals it back up and puts it back in the fridge.
June 15, 4:::10 PM: He scratches off all the lottery tickets that aren't winners and covers up the loser messages with spray paint.
September 18, 7:::19 PM: He pours some of the grease from the hot dog machine into a motor oil container and stocks it up as motor oil.
October 17, 8:::20 AM: He soaks his feet in the nacho cheese dispenser.]
Flip:::  Alright, enough! What'll it take for this to go away?  I'll do anything!
Lincoln and Clyde::: To Clincoln McCloud! Cheers!
Girl Athletes:::  WE'RE NUMBER ONE! TIME FOR NUMBER TWO! WE'RE NUMBER ONE! TIME FOR NUMBER TWO!
Margo:::  HALLELUJAH! Phew! Sorry about the mess.
Lincoln::: No problem. We've got people who take care of that for us. Oh, Flip!
Flip:::  What?  HOLY NACHOS!!!
