Lincoln:::  You've been with us a while and it doesn't need to be said, but in a family as big as mine, everything turns into a competition.
Lynn Sr.::: Okay kids, time for bed!
Lana::: I can make it up the stairs first!
Lynn:::  Uh-huh! Work it! Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Rita::: Kids, come bring in the groceries!
Lori::: I bet I can literally carry the most bags.
Luna::: Yeah!  Go, Luna! Most bags! What? Bags! What?
Lola::: Go, Lola! Biggest burp! Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Lincoln:::  I haven't had a win in forever but that changes today. It's our annual garage sale and at 5 PM today, when the markets close, the victory dance shall be mine!  Oh, what's the matter Lily, you need your blankie?  It's okay, Lily. Your blankie's right here.
Lily::: 
Lincoln:::  Hate to break it to you, ladies, but I'm outselling all of you.
Lisa::: That's amusing from someone who couldn't sell a negative charge to an electron.
Lana::: Yeah? Well, you couldn't sell a rattle to a snake!
Leni::: Well, you couldn't sell a dress if it was 50% off! Not even if it was half off.
Lynn Sr.::: Build up those appetites, salespeople, we're having goulash tonight!
Rita::: Which will be served on our refinished dining table. Have fun out there, kids.
Lincoln::: Yeah, have fun. Watching this rump do the bump.  Dang it.
Lincoln::: Check it out folks! Low prices, high quality!  Clyde, time to put Operation Pretend You've Never Met Me and Are Really Interested in My Stuff So Other People Will Buy It and Also Think of A Shorter Name For This Operation into action.
Clyde:::  Sorry, my walkie cut out. Can you repeat that?
Lincoln:::  Just get over here.  Excellent choice, sir. Not only is that some state-of-the-art head protection...  ...it also doubles as a soup bowl.
Clyde:::  Whoa. Is this a genuine bowl-met? I've searched every garage sale in the state for one of these. How much do you want for it?
Lincoln::: Hmm...five bucks.
Clyde::: I'll give you ten.
Male Customer #1:::  Actually, I was about to buy that. 
Lincoln::: Nice.
Lincoln::: Excellent work, Clyde.
Clyde::: Thanks, Lincoln, for your next customer, I thought I'd break out the old English accent.  Hullo, luv.
Lincoln::: Sweet. No way my sisters are gonna be able to compete with me.
Clyde::: I wouldn't be so sure. Looks like they've got some game too.
Lana:::  Exotic reptiles for sale!
Lana::: Snake bite kits for sale!
Male Customer #2:::  Sold!
Lucy::: Candles. Cobwebs. Cauldrons.
Flip:::  Rubbish.
Lucy:::  Free psychic reading with every purchase.
Flip::: Free? Well, now you're speaking my language, little Psychic Girl. What's your cheapest item?
Lucy::: And now, look into your future.  Hmm. Business will be booming.
Flip::: 
Lisa::: Expired chemicals! Buy one get one free!
Flip:::  Oh, did I hear free?
Lily::: 
Leni::: New paint job, space galore and it comes with its own clicky-thingy. 
Female Customer #1::: You're really selling this?
Leni::: Hello! It's a garage sale.
Lincoln:::  Eh. So, they've made some sales.  My victory dance and I aren't worried.
Clyde::: Wow! You're handling being in last place better than I thought.
Lincoln:::  Last place?  How has Lily sold $20 worth of stuff? What am I doing wrong?
Teddy bear voice::: Please be my friend. 
Lincoln::: Err...maybe, I need to upgrade the merchandise.
Female dancer on TV::: And 1, and 2, and 3. Come on now, girls.
Clyde::: Your mom's wedding dress?
Lincoln::: Eh, she never wears it. Let's make some sales.
Lincoln::: Can I see 60? I see 60! Sold to the mustachioed man in the bandana!  Starting the bid at 300! We've got 300! 400! We've got 500! Sold to the man in the blue jean tuxedo!
Lori:::  Lincoln! What are you doing? This stuff isn't even yours!
Lincoln::: So?
Clyde:::  Lincoln! You only have one minute until 5 P.M. and you're four dollars out of first place!
Lynn Sr.::: That's a wrap, kids! Goulash is served in teeeen~!
Lincoln::: Yes! My losing streak is over! Now, feast your eyes on my caboose because it's leaving the station.
Lori::: Someone give Lily her blankie.
Lincoln::: I don't know where it is.
Lynn::: Oh no! Where could it be?
Lynn:::  Oh no! We must have sold it!
Lincoln:::  Yeah, yeah. Very sad. Now, if you don't mind, I'm about to do my victory dance.
Lily::: 
Lincoln:::  Oh, never mind. I'm sorry, Lily, I guess we all got a little too caught up in our competition.
Lincoln::: So, your big brother is going to put the competition aside and go find your blanket.
Lola::: Oh no! You're not gonna be the hero! I'm gonna find that blankie!
Lana::: Not if I find it first!
Lincoln:::  The victory dance shall be mine!
Luna:::  Hello, ma'am!
Lola:::  Did you buy a blanket?
Luna:::  From a garage sale today?
Female Customer #2:::  I didn't buy a blanket, but I did buy this hunk of junk!  I want my money back!
Luna and Lola::: Uh...  She sold it to you! 
Lori::: I'm getting that blankie first!
Lori::: Sir, sir! Weren't you at a garage today?  OOF! 
Luan::: If you want to win, you need a can-do attitude. 
Lincoln::: Beat it, Lynn! This is my house.
Lynn::: No way! That blanket is mine!
Lincoln::: Whoops! Wrong house.
Old Woman::: Hmm, I think I did buy a blanket. Why don't you come in?
Lisa:::   First to spot the blanket gets the blanket.
Old Woman::: It's so nice to have visitors.  Would you like to see my collection of bingo ribbons?
Leni:::  I win! I found the blanket in that house right there!
Lincoln::: That's not a house. That's a restaurant.
Sloppy's Worker Man::: Order Number 6!
Lincoln::: And you're holding a napkin.
Leni:::  Dang it.
Old Woman:::  B14! Anybody...
Lucy:::  This woman does not have the blanket. Let's get out of here.
Lisa:::  Are you kidding? One more number and I've got a bingo!  Spin it, sister!
Lincoln:::  Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this blanket?  How about you?  Ah-ha! Where did you get this?
Lincoln::: Lily's blankie! Hey, Flip, you were at our garage sale today, weren't you?
Flip::: I don't know, chief. Maybe. I go to a lotta garage sales.
Lincoln::: I need to buy that blanket back from you.
Flip::: No can do! This blanket's working for me. Really gets the bird poop off.
Lincoln::: Please! It's important!
Flip::: Maybe we can do business but it's gonna cost ya!
Rita:::  Be right there, sweetie.
Lincoln:::  Good news, Lily. I've found your blanket.
Lola::: No, you didn't. Because I have it.
Lori:::  Please, I've got it right here.
Luan::: I've got it.
Lisa::: No, I do.
Lynn::: This is Lily's blanket.
Lincoln::: You guys, I'm pretty sure this is the right one.  I had to give Flip all my garage sale money for it.
Lynn::: I gave Flip all my money for this one.
Luna::: Me too.
Luan::: So did I.
Lori::: And me.
Lisa::: I even gave him my bingo ribbon.
Leni::: I bought a blanket from Flip too.
Luna::: Uh, that's a welcome mat, dude.
Leni:::  Dang it.
Lincoln:::  I can't believe this! Flip fooled us all!
Lisa:::  That gasoline-selling swindler!
Rita:::  Here you go, sweetie.  Still hot from the dryer.
Lily::: 
Lori:::   Are you literally joking right now? It's been here all along?
Rita:::  What happened to our furniture?
Lincoln::: Uh...see, we kinda got caught up in a competition.
Lori::: Yeah, and we kinda sold everything.
Rita::: Well, you're all kinda grounded.
Lincoln::: We deserve it. And believe me, we've learned our lesson. No more competing.
Lincoln::: It's too bad 'cause I had a victory dance that would put all of you to shame.
Lola:::  I doubt that.
Lisa::: The chances are slim.
Lincoln::: Oh yeah? All aboard! Woot-woot! This caboose is leaving the station!  Go Lincoln! Best butt shake! Toot-toot! Hmm-hmm! Oh yeah! Best butt shake!
Lana::: You call that a victory dance?  Go Lana! Go Lana!
Lola::: Mine's better! 
Lori::: Why do you even have a butt if that's all you gonna to do with it?
Loud Kids::: Oh yeah! Uh-huh! (etc.)
Rita::: Kids! Please!  This is how you do a victory dance!  Uh-huh! Go Mom! Shake that booty!
Lynn Sr.::: Hah! Gimme a break! Get a load of the goulash shakedown!
Lynn Sr.::: Go, Dad! Shake it down now!
Rita::: Go, Mom! Mm-hmm, oh yeah!
Lincoln:::  Well, now you know where we get it from. As they say, the nuts don't fall too far from the tree.  Ooh! Uh-hmm! Hmm-hmm! Go Lincoln! Go Lincoln!
Flip:::  I'm loving these 2-for-1 chemicals. I'm gonna make a fortune selling them as windshield wiper fluid.  Suckers!  Well, the little Psychic Girl was right. Business is booming.
