Rita::: It's OK, Lily. Mommy's here. Shh.
Louds:::  Not again.
Lynn Sr.:::  Who had the breakfast burrito wrapped in a cozy tortilla with fluffy egg pillow? 
Lola::: That's three nights in a row Lily's kept us up! My beauty is delicate; I can't handle another night without sleep!<Br>
Lincoln::: Poor Lily. Still having bad dreams?
Lily:::  Nightmares!
Luna::: What's going on in that noggin of yours, little dude?
Lynn Sr.::: My ca-Lynn-mari? I don't get it.  There's nothing wrong with my ca-Lynn-mari!
Lisa::: I agree with Father. The nightmares are most likely not gastronomically induced, although your squid could benefit from a pinch of salt and a dash of inspiration.
Lisa::: Good idea, Lily! A visual aid!
Lisa::: Hmm. Let me examine this abstract-  Oh my stars and exoplanets!
Lisa::: Trashy and Tentacle... I've been causing your nightmares!  And here I thought I'd been shielding you from my experiments. Oh, thank goodness you never saw my research on Flip's DNA. Two words: double butt-crack.  But don't worry. I'll figure out how to remedy this situation.
Lisa::: Family, I have discovered the source of Lily's nightmares: me.
Lucy::: Gasp.
Lisa::: To fix this situation, I give you: The Dream Machine!
Lola:::  Hey, did you use parts of my princess ride?!
Lisa::: Please. Save your questions for the end.  Now, these modified pasta strainers will allow the wearer to enter Lily's nightmare and defeat the monsters. Once Lily sees them destroyed, she'll realize there's nothing to be afraid of.
Lynn::: Dibs on monster-mashing!
Lola::: Hey, I don't think so!
Alarm::: Fight cloud alert! Fight cloud alert!
Lisa::: Having predicted your rambunctious response, I have selected which of you will be going. Lincoln for his video game skills...  ...Lynn for her physical strength...  ...Lola for her unchecked aggression...  ...and Leni because she and Lily speak the same language.
Leni::: Poo-poo!
Lily::: Poo-poo!
Lisa::: Now, let's get to work.
Lynn Sr.:::  Here you go, Lis. I made you some nightmare mission ca-Lynn-mari.
Lisa::: Didn't eat it at dinner, won't eat it in a nightmare. But thanks.
Lisa::: Alright, team, it's go time. We'll need nightlights...  ...stuffed animals...  ...and warm milk.
Lisa::: Ha, a nightmare's worst nightmare.
Lisa::: Team, the last piece of equipment is your return button. If you run into trouble, press it and you'll wake up.  Speaking of waking up, the rest of you must keep Lily asleep while we're in her dream. If she wakes up before us, we'll be trapped inside her dream forever.
Lincoln::: Wait, you're just mentioning that now?!
Lisa::: Well, we'll be fine. The odds are in our favor, more or less.  My assistant Lull-a-bot will now transport you into Lily's dream.
Lull-a-bot:::  ROCK-A-BYE BABIES IN A TREETOP. WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, THE CRADLE WILL ROCK. WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS, THE CRADLE WILL FALL. AND DOWN WILL COME BABY, CRADLE AND ALL.  3, 2, 1.
Lisa::: Welcome to Lily's dream.  Testing, testing. Bedroom team, do you read me? Over.
Lynn Sr.:::  Roger that. Bedroom hears you loud and clear.
Lisa::: Let's keep an eye out for any signs of Trashy or Tentacle.
Leni::: Where are we?
Lynn::: Hey, check this out!  My old pigskin! Huh. We must be in our basement. Huh?
Lisa::: Ah, yes. The basement. That would make sense. It's where every nightmare starts.
Lisa::: It sounds like Trashy found Lily! Hurry!
Rita::: Who's mowing their lawn at 3 a.m.?
Luna::: Looks like it's Grouse.
Rita:::  Ooh, I'll handle this.
Mr. Grouse:::  Hey, Loud, what are you do- 
Mr. Coconuts::: Wow. Sleepless Mom doesn't mess around!  And she fell asleep in the shrubs.
Lynn::: Time to take out the trash.
Lisa::: Lynn, wait. You've gotta be careful. If you're taken out in the nightmare, you get taken out in the real world.
Lincoln:::  Come on, you keep adding rules.  And that's kind of a biggie.
Lisa::: Get your night lights ready.
Lisa::: Lily, fear not. We're here to cure your nightmares.
Leni::: Don't worry, Lily. I'll keep you company.
Lola::: You guys have this under control, right? Trash really isn't my thing.  This is dry-clean only! AAH!!!
Lynn::: Now that's how you take out the trash!
Lisa::: One down, one to go.
Lily::: Yay! 
Lucy:::  Oh no. It's Scoots and the Sunset Canyon crew.
Lana:::  Not for long!
Luan::: Wow! Lana just took out the entire crew!
Mr. Coconuts::: And she fell asleep in the shrubs.
Lincoln::: That must be Tentacle.
Lola:::  Thanks for volunteering, Linky!
Lynn::: Hey, look! If Tentacle is in the pipes, we just need to lure him to the toilet.
Lisa::: Wait, take this.  When you're in position, pull the string and drop it.
Lola::: Oh, Linky, you're so brave!
Lisa::: You see, Lily? We defeated both of your monsters! There's nothing to be afraid of.  But your face says otherwise.
Leni::: She said there's one more.
Lincoln::: A third monster?! Another thing Lisa failed to mention! 
Lisa::: Oh, don't look at me. There were only two in her finger painting.
Lincoln, Leni and Lynn::: Whoa!
Flip Monster::: Hey, chiefs.
Lisa:::  Gah! It's almost sunrise! We're running out of time!
Lincoln::: Wait. This is just like the boss battle in my zombie video game!
Lola::: Oh? Was the boss a two-story convenience-store owner with nacho cheese breath?!
Lincoln::: No, but we can do this! If we blast it from different angles, it'll have no place to run and we can take it down!
Lynn::: I'm game!
Lola::: Whatever.
Lisa::: Worth a shot!
Leni::: I'm in!
Lincoln::: Everyone split up and get into position. I'll get his attention.  Hey, Flip! Your nacho cheese is green! I want my money back!
Flip Monster:::  Ah! No refunds!
Lincoln::: Blast it! Now!
Lincoln:::  Wait, isn't Flip lactose-intolerant? Run!
Lynn::: I know it's a dream, but it smells so real!
Flip Monster::: Hey, where'd you go?
Lisa::: This monster's too powerful. We need to abort mission. It's too dangerous to stay here.
Lynn::: If we leave, Lily's nightmares will be even worse!
Flip Monster:::  Eh, peek-a-boo, chiefs!
Lisa::: Press your return buttons! NOW!!!
Lincoln::: Wait, why is Lisa still sleeping?
Lisa:::  Sorry, siblings. I already put one sister's life in danger.
Lisa::: I can't risk any of yours.  I must finish this alone. For Lily.
Lily:::  Lisa!
Lisa::: Lily, I'm sorry! I failed you!
Lily:::  Blegh!  Bad Flip! Leave Lisa alone!
Lisa:::  A ca-Lynn-mari sword?!
Lily::: Lisa!
Lisa::: Lily, that was incredible! From now on, I promise; no more monster experiments.
Lily::: Lily not afraid anymore! 
Lisa:::  Then my mission here is complete.
Lily::: Bye-bye, Lisa!
Lisa:::  Sweet dreams, Lily.
Lisa::: Huh?
Lincoln, Leni, and Lynn::: You made it!
Lola:::  I'm so glad you're okay!
Lynn::: What happened in there? Did you crush that thing?
Lisa::: Nope. She did.
Lisa:::  Huh?
Lily::: Lily has good dream about you.
Lisa::: Pshaw. Tell me all about it, Lily.
