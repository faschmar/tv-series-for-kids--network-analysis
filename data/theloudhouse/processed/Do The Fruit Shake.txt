Carl::: Nope! No! No!
Carlos::: I see you've taken an interest in my vintage record collection.
Carl::: I've gotta find a cool song to remix. DJ Carl's playing at the block party and needs a new hit.
Carlos::: What about this one? It's always made an impact on me.
Carl::: Tropical Fruits? Never heard of them, I'll give it a spin.
Carl::: Give it up for the Fruit Shake remix.
Ronnie Anne::: This song rules.
CJ::: Check it out, Ronnie Anne.  I'm doing the fruit shake.
Ronnie Anne::: Hey, I think I got it, CJ.
Carl::: Do the fruit shake like a superstar. A remix from DJ Carl.  Drop it like it's hot.
Larry Funkman::: DJ Carl.  Baby, love the song, love the fruit. Name's Larry Funkman.
Carl:::  Did you just say you were Larry Funkman? A.K.A the hit making record exect?
Sergio::: A.K.A the million-dollar man?
Larry Funkman::: I sure am, and I want to produce your song and put the fruit shake remix on the radio, I want to make you a star, baby
Carl::: A star?
Fantasy Crowd::: DJ Carl! DJ Carl! DJ Carl!
Sergio::: Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
Larry Funkan::: I can't believe The Tropical Fruits gave you permission to use that song. I've been trying to get that for years now.
Carl:::  Uh… There… Yes, of course they did.
Larry Funkman::: Great, because you can't use the song otherwise. Be in my recording studio tomorrow at noon. And have a funky day baby.
Carl:::  What am I gonna do?
Sergio:::  Retire?
Carl::: But this remix could be my first big hit.
CJ::: Maybe we can find the fruits!
Carl::: They could be anywhere. Wait a second, sounds like a job for Detective Carl!
Carl:::  Tell me about The Tropical Fruits. Where are they now?
Carlos:::  Can I finish eating first?
Sergio:::  Start talking or the torta gets it.
Carlos:::  Their names are Piña, Papaya, and Mango. They recorded ‘Do the Fruit Shake', then vanished.
Carl::: Likely story, Sergio.
Carlos::: Wait! Wait! Piña still performs at a restaurant in the city.
Carl:::  What restaurant? I need answers.
Carlos:::  Uh, the Fun Bowl? No, no, something with fruit.  The Fruit Bowl, that's it. The Fruit Bowl.
Carl::: Now we're talking. Sergio, give the man his torta.
Carlos::: Hey! There's nothing but bread.
CJ::: There's Piña.
Sergio:::  She's still got it.
Carl::: Let's go chat her up.
Waiter::: Can I help you?
Carl::: I just have to talk to that lady.
Waiter::: Ms. Piña prefers to be left in peace after her performance. Now please…
Sergio:::  Anyone gonna eat this? No? Don't mind if I do.
Waiter:::  Pesky parrot.
Carl:::  Hi! I'm DJ Carl, big fan, love what you've got going on.
Piña::: Oh, such a sweet nene.
Carl::: I've got a problem though. I need your permission to record a remix of 'Do the Fruit Shake'.
Piña::: Is this another one of Papaya's pranks?  She's always getting me.
Carl::: No! I played it live and everyone flipped out. See for yourself.
Piña:::  Oh, que fantastico. I love it. Why of course you can have my permission.
Carl:::  Great, just sign this. And do you know where the other fruits are?
Piña::: Mango? Can't help you there. We haven't spoken in many, many years. But I know Papaya's address.
Sergio::: We gotta scram!
Carl:::  Thanks Piña.
Waiter:::  Get back here!
Piña::: Bye!
Carl::: So all you have to do is sign here, Ms. Papaya.
Papaya:::  Sorry, dear, I can't be bothered with all this. I have a piano to move and my movers just cancelled on me.
Carl::: My back.
CJ::: So heavy.
Sergio:::  Qué onda, Sancho? Oh just chillin'.
Carl:::  Okay, we got it up there. So what do you say?
Papaya:::  I suppose the deal's a deal.
Carl::: Thanks. Do you know where we can find Mango?
Papaya::: Oh, I'm afraid we had a bit of a falling out, dear. I haven't heard from her in years.  Papaya?
Sergio::: Alright, Sancho talk to you later.  Now where's this piano?
Carl:::  We'll never find Mango! Think, Detective Carl.
Maybelle:::  Add a little mango and papaya twist...
Carl:::  We're so close…
Maybelle::: Come on down…
Carl::: I can practically hear Mango singing.
CJ:::  Wait, I hear her too.
Maybelle:::  Do the fruit shake.
Carl::: Wait a minute.
Maybelle::: Do the fruit shake. Do the fruit shake. Do the fruit shake.
Carl::: Maybelle? You're Mango from The Tropical Fruits?
Maybelle::: I haven't been called that name in years.
Carl::: Can I get permission to use ‘Do the Fruit Shake' for my remix?
Maybelle::: Nope.
Carl::: What? Why not?
Maybelle:::  I can't stand that song.
Carl::: Then why are you singing it?
Maybelle::: Because you played it at that block party and now it's stuck in my head. But it brings back too many bad memories. Let me take you back to the days of disco, the nineteen-seventies.
Crowd::: Tropical Fruits! Tropical Fruits!
Mango::: Our new song is out of sight, girls. We're gonna be the biggest thing since sliced mangoes.  Speaking of which, where's my pre-show mango?
Papaya::: I haven't seen it.
Piña::: Don't look at me... uh… what?
Mango::: This better not be another one of your pranks, you know I need it to calm my nerves.
Stagehand::: Ladies, you're on. Sock it to ‘em.
Mango::: Uh… Good evening, we're the... uh... We're The Tropical Toots. Uh, wait, no.  I told you I needed that mango. I'm sick of all this prankin'!
Maybelle::: I've never been more embarrassed. Thanks for reminding me.
Bobby:::  Saddest story I've ever heard.
Carl::: We've just got to get Piña and Papaya to say they're sorry. Then Maybelle will give me permission.
CJ::: But how will we get them together?
Bobby:::  Oh, hi. These oranges are fifty percent off.  Make that sixty percent.
Carl::: Hey, that gives me an idea.  Thanks, Bobby.
Carl:::  Big pineapple sale at the Casagrande mercado.
Sergio:::  Big papaya sale at the Casagrande mercado.
Carl & Sergio::: Be there at five p.m. on the dot.
Piña::: Que fabuloso!
Papaya::: Ooh, you got it, Birdman.
Carl::: Good thing I've been practicing my handwriting.
Maybelle::: Huh?  Mango sale… Casagrande Mercado. Five p.m. sharp. I'm there.
Carl:::  Three… Two… One.
Piña::: I'm here for the pineapple sale!
Papaya::: Now where are all these papayas?
Maybelle:::  Give me all the mangoes you got.
Papaya::: Mango?
Piña::: Aye bendito, is that you chica?
Maybelle::: Huh?  What are you two doing here?
Carl:::  ‘What a coincidence, it's a Tropical Fruits reunion. Hey, got any old beefs you want to settle?
Bobby:::  Oh no. What's gonna happen?
Maybelle::: Ah, I see what's going on. You lured me here to prank me again.
Papaya::: We didn't do that.
Maybelle:::  Heard that one before. Let's see how you like it.
Sergio:::  Fruit fight!
Bobby::: Ladies, please!  Act your age.
Carl::: STOP!  This is my fault. I tricked you all into meeting up again. I just wanted to use your song, and I thought if you talked it out Piña and Papaya would finally apologize for taking Maybelle's mango.
Maybelle:::  They're never going to fess up. That's why I quit!
Piña:::  We wanted to apologize, but then you disappeared and we couldn't find you. I even held on to your lucky mango all these years.  Hoping to one day give it back.
Carl:::  You saved her old mango? Gross.
Maybelle:::  My mango. Still looks good after all these years.
Papaya:::  We pranked you way too much. We never thought it would break us up.
Piña:::  <abbr title=Forgive us>Perdónanos</abbr>
Maybelle::: Bring it in you two.  Sorry I never gave you a chance to explain.
Papaya::: To think we've wasted so much time over such a silly fight.
Maybelle::: I know. I wish we could go back to those days.
Carl::: Maybe you can.
Carl::: This is DJ Carl with the Fruit Shake remix. Featuring The Tropical Fruits.
