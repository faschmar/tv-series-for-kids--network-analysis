Lincoln::: Take that, zombie!  Feel my twerk, you evil jerk!  Hoo!
Lori::: Lincoln!
Lincoln:::  AAHHH!
Lori::: There's only one rule in this house: Stay out of my bedroom! If I catch you in here again, I will literally turn you into a human pretzel!  No, not you, Bobby.  One sec, okay? 
Lincoln::: Oh, yeah!  Zombies don't need to see this. 
Lincoln::: Occupied!
Lincoln:::  I can't believe some... 
Lori:::  Bobby, you'll never guess what Whitney said to me today.
Lincoln:::  That you don't respect a man's privacy?
Lori:::  No, silly! Not even. She was all like...
Lincoln::: Oh no! My gaming glasses! 
Lana::: No running in the hallway!
Lincoln::: Huh? What are you talking about?
Lola::: Lana, is this maggot giving you lip? 
Lana::: We're the new hall monitors at school, so we're practicing at home.
Lola::: If we catch you speeding again, you're going downtown! We already locked up Luan for telling bad jokes. 
Luan::: Hey! Did you hear the one about the thief who stole a calendar? He got twelve months!  Get it?
Lola::: That's five more minutes, dirt bag!
Lincoln::: Okay, okay. I'll walk within the speed limit. I swear.
Lana::: NO SWEARING!
Lincoln::: Someone stepped on my glasses! NOOOOO!
Lincoln:::  LORI! YOU DIRT BAG!
Lincoln::: One minute I'm electric-sliding with the undead, and the next...  It's all Lori's fault!
Clyde:::  I can't believe it!
Lincoln::: I know! She didn't even say sorry!
Clyde:::  No. I can't believe these were touched by Lori's beautiful tootsies... 
Lincoln::: Snap out of it, Clyde! Lori's a monster! All she cares about is talking on her stupid phone! Well, I'm going to give her a call she'll never forget...
Clyde::: What are you gonna say?
Clyde::: Why 'blank' is the worst sister ever?
Lincoln:::  I knew this would come in handy someday. I just didn't know which sister would be getting it.  But you, Lori Loud, have made my decision very easy. 
Lincoln:::  Agh. Must be charging her phone. No worries. I'll just leave it on her voicemail.
Voicemail::: Hey, this is Lori. You know what to do.
Lincoln::: Hey, Lori. It's your dear brother, Lincoln. There's something I've been meaning to tell you. You are...  ...and that is why you are the WORST SISTER EVER!  What do you think, Clyde?
Lori::: Hey, bro. I just wanted to say I'm so sorry I stepped on your stupid toy. So I went out and bought you a stupid new one.
Lincoln:::  You did what now?
Lori:::  Also, I'm very impressed you didn't freak out over this. Very mature.
Lincoln:::  Yep. That's me. Mr. Mature.
Clyde:::  Huh? 
Lincoln::: Good talk.
Lincoln::: Perfect! Lori doesn't have her cell which means it's still in there charging. Our mission is to infiltrate her room and delete the message before she gets back.
Clyde::: But Lori's room is off limits.
Lincoln::: I know. That's why I need you to be a lookout for her.
Clyde::: That's easy. I'm always on the lookout for Lori.
Lincoln::: Then let's do this!
Clyde:::  In position.
Lincoln::: Roger that.
Lana::: I know poop when I see it, and that's definitely some poop.
Lincoln::: Drat! The po-po! I can't go through, so I'm gonna have to go over!
Lana::: Hey, fur ball! No speeding!
Twins::: Hey! What did we just say? Get back here!
Lincoln::: I'm in.
Clyde:::  Great. Proceed two clicks north, hook a left, and you should be right over the target.
Lincoln::: I've got eyes on the package.
Clyde::: Lincoln! Lori's coming!
Lincoln::: You're going to have to stall her!
Clyde::: Roger that...  Hey, beautiful, you take these stairs often?
Lori:::  I will now...handsome~... 
Message::: Hey, Lori. It's your dear brother, Lincoln.
Phone::: Message deleted.
Lincoln::: And that's how we're gonna do it!
Clyde::: I love it! Especially the part where I get to talk to Lori. 
Lincoln:::  Is that perfume?
Clyde::: Yeah. It's my Nana's.
Lincoln::: Here are the blueprints for the vents. 
Clyde::: Are these food stains?
Lincoln::: I eat ketchup-sandwiches while I floor-plan.  Quiet! Lori's coming!
Lincoln::: Okay, let's do this.
Clyde:::  I'M IN POSITION!
Lincoln::: Roger that. 
Lola::: No, I can't let you off with a warning!
Lily::: 
Lola::: Next time, remember. This is a mandatory diaper zone!
Lincoln::: Gah...ketchup fingers...
Lana::: She's making a crawl for it!
Lincoln::: Clyde, I'm in.
Lucy::: Hey, Lincoln.
Lincoln:::  Lucy! What are you doing in here?
Lucy::: I come here to think. I actually just wrote a new poem called Ventilate.
Lincoln:::  Riiight.  Clyde, get me to Lori's room, now. 
Clyde::: Go three clicks, and a right. Or was it three rights and a click? Wait. What's a click?
Lincoln:::  Never mind. I think I'm there. 
Lucy::: Hey, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Phew. Thanks, Luce.
Clyde::: Lincoln! Everything okay?
Lincoln:::  Yeah, Clyde.  Everything's perfect.
Lincoln::: I've got eyes on the package.
Clyde::: Package? What about Lori's phone?
Lincoln::: Clyde, what kind of rope is this?
Clyde::: Cherry licorice rope.
Clyde:::  Lincoln! Lori's coming!  Don't worry, I'll stall her. 
Lori::: What?
Lori::: Ugh! Gross! 
Lincoln::: Ugh! 
Lori:::  So, this is where all my shoes are. 
Lori::: Finally.  Ooh! New messages! I'm so loved! 
Lincoln:::  Mission is compromised! The package is on the move! Clyde?
Lincoln::: Clyde! Do you read me?!
Message 1::: Hey, babe. It's Bobby. Do you think we'll always be together?
Lori::: Aww! Totes saving that one! 
Message 2::: Hey, babe. It's Bobby again. Should our couple name be Bori or Lobby?
Lori:::  Saved.
Lola::: We warned you, dirt bag!
Lana::: It's the clink for Linc!
Lincoln::: Look! Luan's making a jailbreak!
Lana::: Hey!
Lola::: Oh, forget that bum. He's out of our jurisdiction now.
Lana::: Yeah. Let's get doughnuts.
Message::: Hey, Lori. It's your dear brother, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Lori!  NOOOOO!  Ugh!
Message::: There's something I've been meaning to tell you. You are...
Lori:::  Ugh! Delete! Lincoln, there are two rules in this house: stay out of my room, and never call my phone! My voicemail is full enough without useless messages from you!
Lincoln:::  Gee, Lori, I'm sorry.
Lori:::  But, I'm gonna let it slide this time 'cause you were so mature when I broke your stupid toy.
Lincoln:::  Yeah, right. That's me. Mr. Mature.
Lori::: Bobby. Only 12 messages today? I thought you cared about me.
Lincoln:::  Next time I have a problem with one of my sisters, I'll just talk to them instead of leaving a message or writing a nasty letter.  Speaking of which, where is that letter? 
Lori:::  If you want our couple name to be Lobby, you're going to have to show a little-  What's this? Why Lori is the worst sister ever?  Bobby, I gotta go. I'm about to turn Lincoln into a human pretzel!
Lori:::  LINCOLN! WHAT IS THIS?!
Lincoln::: Well, it's time to do the official dance of the Loud House: the Running Man! 
Lori:::  WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU, I'M GONNA-
