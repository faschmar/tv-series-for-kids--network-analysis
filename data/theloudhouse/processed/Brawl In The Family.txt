Luna::: Sorry bro, kitchen's off limits. Lori's in there cooling off. She and Leni had a major throwdown.
Lincoln::: Yeah, sad story. But I'm hungry.
Lisa:::  Fear not, male sibling. You should be able to satiate your appetite by forging under the couch cushions.  See what I scored?
Lincoln::: Ooh, an everything bagel. 
Lisa:::  Mmm...correction, a plain bagel with lint, dog hair,  Gadzooks! Is that a booger?
Lincoln:::  Do not eat the couch bagel.
Lana::: Sorry, bathroom's off limits. Leni is in there cooling off from the fight.  Here, use this.
Lincoln::: A bucket? 
Lana::: Don't knock it till you try it.
Lynn::: Sorry, TV's off limits.
Lincoln:::  Aw, come on! Why?
Lola::: Lori and Leni are on edge. You watching a Monster Truck Rally is not going to help them.
Lincoln::: This is ridiculous! What are they even fighting about?
Lori::: Guys! Guys! Guys!  Check out this dress I found at the mall. It's literally one of a kind. 
Lori's sisters::: Oooohh...
Leni:::  OMGosh, you guys! Look at this dress I found at the mall!
Leni:::  Ooohh...when did we put a mirror in the living room?
Lori::: That's not a mirror, that's me! Now go take your dress back!
Leni::: What? No! You take yours back!
Lincoln::: That's it? You gotta be kidding me! Clyde and I wear the same shirt on picture day, and we didn't care. 
Lucy::: It's a sister thing. You wouldn't understand.
Lincoln::: Well, let's go help them work it out. So we can have our house back.  Oof!
Lynn::: Negative. In this family, we have a sister fight protocol. Butt out, and let them resolve it on their own.
Lincoln:::  Yeah? Well I have a protocol, too! Which is I don't like pooping in a bucket!  Hey guys. Now look, I know you've been having a little problem.
Lori::: Lincoln.
Lincoln::: But I think I can settle this.
Leni::: Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Leni, why don't you just return the dress? Lori once said blue makes you look washed out anyway.
Leni:::  Wait, what?!
Lincoln::: Okay, okay. I'm just spitballing here. Lori, why don't you return the dress? Leni says taffeta makes you look like Aunt Ruth. And who wants that? Am I right? 
Lori:::  Excuse me?!
Lincoln::: So what do you say? Ready to hug it out?
Lori::: We already hugged it out! We were fine! But now that I know that she thinks I look like Aunt Ruth, WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT FINE!!!!!
Leni::: You insulted my skin tone! Nothing's gonna make that right!
Lynn::: Ugh, nice job Lincoln! We told you to stay out of it!
Lisa::: Based on rising decibel levels, I'm up in the threat level in the house from thunderstorm to hissing cats. Sisters, to your stations!
Lincoln::: Uh, what's going on?
Lola::: Let us handle it.
Luna::: Scram, dude. We need your room.
Lincoln::: What? Why?
Luan::: Lori's approaching the sector, and we can't risk a run-in with Leni.
Luna::: Coast is clear, brah.
Lucy::: Copy that.  You may proceed.
Lucy:::  Abort, abort. Leni is headed back up. 
Lori::: Ah!
Lincoln:::  Ah!
Luan::: Lincoln, make like a drum and beat it!  Get it? But seriously, out.
Lincoln::: 
Lynn Sr.::: ...And then Mort realized he was drinking regular, not decaf! 
Lori:::  Dinner was delicious, Mom.
Rita::: Thanks, sweetie!
Lincoln::: Yeah, thanks, Mom. I am stuffed.
Rita::: Well, I hope you saved room for dinner.
Lincoln:::  Wait, what?
Lynn Sr.::: Sister fight protocol. Lori and Leni dine separately.
Rita::: And we have to eat with them both. So they don't think we're taking sides.
Lynn Sr.::: And then Mort realized he was drinking regular, not decaf! 
Leni::: 
Lincoln::: Hey, what gives? What happened to my sheets and blanket?
Lana::: Sister fight protocol. We used them to make a divider in Lori and Leni's room.
Lincoln::: Well, what am I supposed to sleep under?
Lana::: Try this. 
Lincoln:::  Alright, that's it!
Lana::: Lincoln, what are you doing?  Guys, we have a situation.
Lincoln::: I'm done with this! You guys and your stupid fight have ruined the whole day! It's time to get over it and make up!
Luan::: Lincoln, this has to run its course. Sister fight protocol.
Lincoln::: Forget sister fight protocol!
Leni::: Well, I'm not sleeping in here with her!
Lori::: I'm not sleeping in here with her, either!
Lincoln::: Fine! Luna, you sleep in here tonight, Leni sleeps in your room.
Leni::: Works for me!
Lori::: Me too!
Luna::: You're playing with fire, bro!
Lincoln::: Listen. By tomorrow, Lori and Leni will have cooled off, and you'll be thanking me! 
Lincoln::: Hmmm, peaceful. Sounds like good ol' Lincoln saved the day.
Luan:::  Just admit you're wrong!
Luna:::  You're wrong, dude!
Lincoln::: Or not.  Wait a minute, that didn't sound like Lori and Leni. 
Luna::: Lori had the dress first! She told me the whole story last night!
Luan::: Well, Leni told me her side, and she clearly had the dress first!
Luna::: Ha! That's funnier than most of your lame jokes!
Luan::: Oh I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you! I've gone partially deaf from your horrible guitar playing!
Lincoln::: Guys, guys.
Lynn::: SISTER FIGHT PROTOCOL! DIVIDE AND ISOLATE!
Lola::: You're paying for new shocks, Lincoln!
Lana:::  This room is now off limits! 
Lincoln::: Come on! Why is it always my room?
Lisa::: Congratulations, elder brother. Thanks to you, the threat level is now a stampeding T-Rex.
Lynn Sr.::: Stampeding T-Rex?!  Alright, we'll storm out in here.
Rita:::  Did you remember the bucket?
Lynn Sr.::: Dang it!
Lisa:::  Commencing T-Rex protocol. I've got Big L, and we're on the move.
Lucy:::  Roger that.
Lana:::  We're headed for the red zone.
Lola:::  Copy that, we're headed for the green zone.
Lana::: Lola, what are you doing? This is the red zone. The door is red.
Lola::: Uh, hello! The carpet is green.
Bobby::: Here you go, Mrs. Loud.
Rita:::  Thanks Bobby. Just the large pepperoni for us, you can deliver the rest to the front door.
Bobby::: Do I have to? Lori told me the threat level is at Stampeding T-Rex.
Lynn Sr.::: Just ring the doorbell and run. 
Bobby::: Ohhh! Good call, Mr. L.
Lucy::: Okay, first seating will be Leni, Luan, and Lana.
Lisa:::  Roger! Copy that.
Lucy::: Gasp! What are you doing? You're supposed to be watching Lori, Luna, and Lola.
Lynn::: Can't I have a break? I've been working for nine hours.
Lucy::: So have I, and you don't see me complaining.
Lynn::: Oh yeah, cause you're always such a ray of sunshine.
Lucy::: At least I don't smell like crusty athletic socks.
Lynn::: Please! Like Eau De Death is better.
Lisa::: Oh, boy. Here we go. We are now at Erupting Volcano, people.
Lana::: ENOUGH WITH YOUR DUMB CHART!!! 
Lisa::: How would you like to eat that hat?!
Lincoln::: Hey guys.  Clyde, come in!
Clyde::: Hey Lincoln, what's up?
Lincoln::: Is your trundle bed available?
Clyde::: Is it for you, or Lori?
Lincoln::: For me, Clyde! Duh! Sorry buddy, I'm a little stressed. We're at Erupting Volcano over here.
Clyde::: Say no more.
Lincoln::: And the next thing I know, they're all fighting.
Clyde::: Interesting, and how did that make you feel?
Lincoln::: Clyde, what are you doing?
Clyde::: When I take my problems to Dr. Lopez, this is how she helps me.
Lincoln::: Okay, okay! Anyway, I feel frustrated. Their ridiculous sister fight protocol only makes things worse. If they'd just let me help them, I can fix everything.
Clyde::: I see. So what do you plan to do?
Lincoln::: I'm gonna march back in there tomorrow, and talk some sense into those girls.
Clyde::: That seems sensible.  Hmm, I see our time is up.
Lincoln::: What?! Can't I stay over?
Clyde::: Oh! I'm sorry. I'm so used to hearing Dr. Lopez say that.
Lincoln::: Okay.  Here goes.  ATTENTION, LOUD SISTERS! I AM HERE TO RESOLVE YOUR CONFLICTS! PLEASE REMAIN CALM! I AM COMING IN!
Lincoln:::  What's going on? What happened to the fighting?
Lori::: Pfft. We're over that. We made up.
Lincoln::: All of you?
Lisa::: Correct. Threat level is back to Field of Daisies.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, thank goodness!
Lincoln::: I don't understand. How did you fix everything?
Lisa::: No, Lincoln. You fixed everything.
Lincoln::: Me? How?
Lisa::: By leaving.
Luan::: We told you, if you just butted out, we'd resolve it on our own.
Lincoln::: But the dress?
Leni::: I came up with the perfect solution. Lori gets to wear it on the days that end in Y, and I get to wear it the rest of the time.
Lynn::: And once they made up, the rest of us made up.
Lincoln::: Heh. Well, I guess I've learned my lesson: always respect the sister fight protocol.
Lana::: Glad you're finally getting it.
Lincoln::: Oh, I totally do, believe me. Next time when Lynn says she needs a windshield wiper when Lisa talks, or Lana says Lola snores like Pop-Pop, I am staying out of it.
Lisa:::  You said what now, SPORTY?! 
Lola:::  Oh, I snore, do I? HOW CAN YOU HEAR ME OVER ALL YOUR SLEEP-FARTING?!
Lynn Sr.::: Phew. Can't wait to use the real toilet.
Lynn Sr::: AAAHH!!! RETREAT!!! RETREAT!!! 
Lincoln::: WAIT FOR ME!!!
