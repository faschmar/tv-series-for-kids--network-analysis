Carlota:::  That's six times, Carl; give it up.
Carl::: No way; I'm wearing you down! 
Ronnie Anne:::  Help!  This little pirate is making me walk the plank!
CJ::: Captain CJ will save you, Ronnie Anne!
Ronnie Anne::: Thank you, CJ; you're my hero.
Rosa::: Alright, is everyone ready for Family Day? Where should we go this week?
CJ:::  Pirate dinner show!
Frida::: Sweetie, I know how much you love the pirate dinner show, but maybe you could try something new.
Sergio:::  Pirate dinner show.
Hector::: I'm not buying you a ticket.
Ronnie Anne::: I vote for pirate dinner show, too.
Frida:::  Mija, the pirate show is fun, but every time we go, CJ tries to get picked to raise the pirate flag.
Carlos::: And he never is, which leaves him disappointed for weeks.
Ronnie Anne::: Well, what if I could figure out a way to get CJ picked?
Carlos::: Well, it's worth a shot.
Frida::: Okay, pirate dinner show it is.
Carlos::: Woohoo.
Carlota::: Ha, high five, CJ!
Carl::: Me too, sis!
Carl::: Yeah! I finally won one!
Carl::: My choo-choo chonies!
Ronnie Anne::: Woah! This is awesome.
CJ::: I know. Woo-hoo! Pirate show.
Carlos::: Ow.
CJ::: Oops, sorry Dad.
Carlos:::  It's okay, I'm fine. 
Bobby:::  Glow sticks!  Can you float me a five?
Carl::: With interest, you owe me seven.
Maria::: Really, Dad? A radio?
Hector::: What? The soccer match is on.
Maria::: But it's family dinner!
Hector:::  I paid for your college.
Sergio:::  And nursing school.  Whoops, I'm not here. 
Ronnie Anne::: CJ, don't worry, as soon as they call for a volunteer from the crowd, I'll make sure you're the one who gets picked.
Kid::: Ha, good luck.
Ralphie::: I always get picked to raise the pirate flag, and I'm not planning on breaking my streak tonight.
Ronnie Anne::: I totally get that, but it's my cousin CJ's dream. Maybe you could just let him get picked, just this once?
CJ:::  Ahoy, matey.
Ralphie::: Yeah, better let me do it.
Ronnie Anne::: You know what? You're not nice. My cousin's gonna get picked today, not you; I'm gonna make sure of that.
Ralphie::: Psh, we'll see.
Hector::: SCORE!!! Si se√±o-  Uh, chicken's here.
Captain Dave::: I told you the treasure was buried on Deadtooth Island, and what a bounty it be. Eh? 
Pirate Byron:::  Oh no, Captain Dave, it's the red pirates! They must be after our treasure.
Captain Dave:::  Pretty soon, we'll be needing one of ye landlubbers to help us raise the Jolly Roger, and prepare to fight.
Ronnie Anne::: Ooh, CJ, let's move closer to the action. You'll have a way better chance at getting picked down there.  Hey, Abuelo, we're just gonna go walk around a little.
Hector:::  Oh, it's tied, one to one.
Carl::: What'd they do? Glue this on? 
Carlos:::  --that's cold!
Carl::: Oops, sorry Dad.
Frida::: Ooh, maybe you can find some new pants in the gift shop. I think I saw clothing in there.
Ronnie Anne:::  Looks like no one is going to claim these seats, so their ours.
CJ::: You mean arrrs.
Ralphie::: Waiter,-- those aren't their seats.
Ronnie Anne::: This is way better; the pirates can definitely see us now.
Waiter:::  Can I see your tickets? Please.
Carl::: Dad, what are you wearing?
Carlos::: They didn't have much of a pants department.
Carlota:::  Cute, can I borrow those sometime?
Ralphie:::  Oh, welcome back.
Ronnie Anne:::  Alright CJ, we need another way to draw attention to you.
CJ::: Let's use those.
Ronnie Anne::: That's perfect!  Bobby, can we borrow your glow sticks?
Bobby::: What? No.
Ronnie Anne::: It's... for... CJ!
Bobby::: But I went into debt for these!
Ronnie Anne::: I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
Carlos:::  Well it's fine if I keep it covered.
CJ::: I got you Dad. 
Captain Dave:::  Ah harr! Avast! We need a volunteer from the audience to raise the Jolly Roger.
Ralphie::: Me! Pick me! Over here!
Ronnie Anne::: CJ, he's looking at you!
Ralphie:::  Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, this can't happen, no. Ah.  Pick me, it's my birthday.
Captain Dave:::  Well, shiver me timbers, we've got a birthday boy, come on down matey.
CJ:::  I never get picked.
Ronnie Anne::: That's not fair! He cheated!
Maria::: Mija! What are you doing?
Ronnie Anne:::  It's not his birthday! He lied, so you'd pick him. My cousin CJ should be down here raising the flag.
Captain Dave::: Arrgh!  Is it really your birthday bud?
Ralphie:::  That's what my hat says. Doesn't it?
Captain Dave:::  Why don't you go back to your seat so we can get on with the show?
Ralphie:::  Yeah, back to your seat, you scallywag!
Ronnie Anne:::  Chill out, dude!
CJ::: Ronnie Anne is walking the plank! I have to help her.  I will save you, Ronnie Anne! 
Rosa::: Aye, CJ, no! 
Hector::: Ow!
Rosa::: Come on, Hector!
Frida::: We're coming too!
Everyone Else::: Us too!
Sergio::: Intermission already?  Ooh, pollo. 
CJ::: Ronnie Anne, I will save you!
Frida::: CJ, you have to get off the ship!
Captain Dave:::  It's a pirate family, it is! Yee scallywags can't board me ship, uh...  Seriously, you're ruining the show. Just go back to your seats.
Ronnie Anne::: Wait! Please let my cousin raise the Jolly Roger. It's his dream!
Ralphie:::  No way! I was picked.
Audience Member::: Come on! On with the show!
Captain Dave:::  New guy, don't just stand there, help me out!
Carlos::: Oh, uh, no, no; I'm not a pirate.
Sergio:::  Aye, aye, captain.
Carlos::: It's not what it looks like.
Carlota::: Cute headscarf, where do you shop?
Pirate Byron:::  Ugh, let's go, let's go.
Ronnie Anne::: I'm not leaving 'til CJ raises the Jolly Roger!  Now's your chance, CJ!
Captain Dave::: Why, you...!
Hector:::  GOAL!  Oh, sorry.
Pirate Byron:::  Nice going, you just knocked out our captain. 
Ronnie Anne::: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to! I just wanted to help my cousin.
Pirate Byron::: Well, without our captain, we're gonna have to cancel the show.
CJ:::  We'll never let the Red Pirates take our treasure! Prepare for battle!
Ronnie Anne::: CJ, is that from the show?
CJ::: Yeah, I know the whole thing.
Ronnie Anne::: Wait, pirate guys, you can finish the show; CJ will be your captain.
Pirate Byron::: Alright, it's worth a shot.  New guy, ready the cannons.
Carlos::: Oh, but I, uh... 
Ralphie::: Uh, wait! I should be the captain!
Ronnie Anne:::  Let me at him.
CJ::: No, I got this.  Get ready to be shark bait!
Ralphie::: Huh?
CJ::: I never leave a pirate behind.
Pirate Byron::: This is incredible! This is better than the real show.  Arr, captain, we've defeated the Red Pirates! There's just one thing left to do.
CJ::: Aye.  Victory is arrs!
Rosa::: Carlos! Get the rubies!
Frida::: I'm so proud of you.  My baby's a star.
Ronnie Anne::: Congrats CJ, you were awesome!
CJ::: Thanks Ronnie Anne, this was the best family day ever.
Ralphie:::  Uh, CJ...  ...can I talk to you for a second?  Hey, I, uh, just wanted to say... thanks for saving me. You weren't bad as the captain.
CJ::: 'Not bad'?
Ralphie:::  Okay, you were awesome, and... I'm sorry about the way I treated you.
CJ::: Thanks, maybe I'll see you next time.
Ralphie:::  Aye aye captain, I hope so.  Oh, ha ha... hello...  I deserved that...
Rosa::: Okay, time to go.  Wait, where's Carlos?
Carlos::: Uh, no, I can't do the Wednesday show, but Saturday is good for me.
Pirate Byron::: Perfect.
Sergio:::  Wait, I have a conflict.
