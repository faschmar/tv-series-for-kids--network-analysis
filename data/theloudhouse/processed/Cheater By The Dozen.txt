Clyde::: Pause!
Lincoln::: Huh?
Clyde::: Time for the 20/20 rule. For every 20 minutes looking at a screen, you should look away for 20 seconds.
Lincoln::: Is that really a thing?
Clyde::: Of course. These peepers gotta last us a lifetime.  Oh, hey, look. There's Bobby.
Lincoln::: What's he doing around here?
Clyde::: I'll tell you what he's doing. He's cheating on Lori! I knew it. Underneath that flawless hair and those washboard abs beats the cold heart of a liar. 
Lincoln:::  Slow down there, Hercules. Why don't we wait until he comes out? Then we'll see what's really going on.
Teri::: See you tomorrow, Roberto!
Bobby::: Ciao, bella! 
Lincoln:::  Hey, Bobby.
Clyde::: Fancy seeing you here, miles away from your house. And Lori, your beautiful...loyal...girlfriend. 
Lincoln:::  So, what are you doing here?
Bobby::: Uh, I can't really get into that. But do me a favor and please don't tell Lori you saw me here. It's complicated. Thanks. Ciao. 
Lincoln::: Clyde, you were right! There's only one thing to do now.
Clyde::: Get ripped, defeat Bobby in fisticuffs, and win back Lori's honor?
Lincoln:::  Uh, no. I was thinking we tell Lori the truth.
Clyde:::  To each his own, my friend.
Lincoln::: Here goes nothing.
Lori:::  Oh, Boo-Boo Bear. I can't wait for our anniversary date this Friday.
Bobby::: I'm counting down the minutes.
Lori and Bobby::: 4,320! 
Lori::: Oh, we are so clearly soulmates. I literally don't know what I would do without you in my life.
Clyde::: Come in, Heartbreaker! This is Dr. Rebound. Did you tell her yet?
Lincoln::: Negative, Doc. It wasn't the right time.
Clyde::: There's never gonna be a right time to tell Lori Bobby's a lowdown, two-bit, snake-in-the-grass cheater.
Lola::: WHAT?!
Lola::: Bobby's cheating on Lori?! Tell us everything!
Lincoln::: You can't just burst in here and-  Okay, okay!
Lincoln::: And then he was all like, but don't tell Lori you saw me. It's complicated.
Lola::: That dirtbag!
Lisa::: Now hang on. Although Lincoln's story does seem to indicate that Bobby is a cheating scoundrel, we don't have enough evidence yet.
Lola::: Lisa's right. We should plant some.
Lisa::: Incorrect. We need to gather some.
Lana::: Yeah. You can't drop a bomb on Lori without being 1 zillion% sure. She'll end you if you're wrong.
Lynn::: One time, I told her we were out of bread, but then she found a loaf and beat me with it.
Lincoln::: So, how do you propose we gather this evidence?
Leni, Luna, Luan, Lynn, Lucy, Lana, Lola, and Lisa::: Stakeout!
Luan::: Oh. Has Cheater-Cheater-Pumpkin-Eater shown up yet?
Lincoln::: Negative.
Leni::: Since steak is kinda unhealthy, do you guys mind if we make this a salmon-out?
Lisa::: I rigged audio surveillance, but a vicious beast prevented me from installing visuals.
Lisa:::  AAH! LARGE WILD ANIMAL! 
Luna:::  Dudes! Here comes the Bob-sled!
Lisa::: Okay, stud muffin, let's see just what you're up to.
Teri::: Ti amo.
Teri's boyfriend::: Ti amo.
Lisa::: That's I love you in Italian! His cheating ways have crossed the language barrier.
Lincoln:::  I think we've seen enough.
Clyde::: Let's get him!
Leni:::  Wow. Bobby's really put on some height.
Lisa:::  That's not Bobby.
Lincoln::: What's going on?
Luna::: Dudes, it's simple. Bobby doesn't have a side-gal. He's just friends with that chick. And Daddy-Long-Legs is her boyfriend.
Lynn:::  Nice going, Lincoln! Way to waste our time!
Leni::: And our salmon!
Clyde::: Time for the 20/20 rule.
Lincoln::: Didn't that get us into trouble last time?
Clyde::: Oh, hey, look. There's Bobby.
Lincoln:::  Seriously?
Clyde:::  What's he doing in a dress shop?
Lincoln::: Where'd you get binoculars?
Clyde:::  Now he's with a different girl?
Lincoln::: Ha! I knew we were right!
Clyde:::  That does it! 
Lincoln::: It's-- all so clear! Bobby is cheating! We just had the wrong girl.
Lincoln:::  I know! I'm mad, too!  Good! Channel that anger.  Oh. 
Dana::: We're still on for later, right?
Bobby::: I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Clyde:::  Wouldn't miss it for the world. A cheater and a cheese ball.
Lincoln::: We have to tell my sisters.
Clyde::: But they're not gonna believe us after what happened last time. We need photographic evidence.
Lincoln::: Good point. Let's roll.
Clyde:::  How about this one? It'll bring out your eyes.
Lincoln::: Wait. Now who's this girl?
Clyde::: I think we've stumbled onto something bigger than we expected: a multiple-cheater-cheater-pumpkin-eater situation.
Lincoln::: Come on! We have to follow them.
Clyde::: Lincoln, let me do the pedaling. I need to work out my thighs.
Clyde::: This is a new low. I can't believe he'd take some random girl to Make-Out Hill.
Lincoln:::  We got you know, Pumpkin Eater.
Lincoln::: Follow that car!
Lincoln:::  Where's he going now?
Lincoln::: This is getting ridiculous!
Clyde::: Dang it. Lost our visuals.
Lincoln:::  Who's a good boy?
Clyde:::  Not Bobby.
Lincoln::: Now, scoot!
Lincoln::: And we're in.
Clyde:::  Ooh...shaky cam doesn't agree with me. 
Pam::: Why don't you slip out of those clothes, and we'll get started.
Clyde:::  I'M NOT ALLOWED TO WATCH R-RATED MOVIES!
Bobby:::  Oh, yes, I love you, too!  Aw, such a pretty girl. 
Lincoln::: Disgusting! Now he's crossing species.
Lincoln::: What is this place?
Clyde::: Probably some kind of underground club for cheaters.
Lincoln::: I don't see Pumpkin Eater anywhere.
Lincoln:::  Man, this guy is full of surprises! 
Lincoln::: That's the girl from the mall!  Come on!
Clyde:::  I can't believe it! He's popping the question!
Lincoln:::  That's it! I'm calling this in, Clyde! 
Lincoln::: You believe me now?
Luan:::  Sadly, yes.
Lisa::: And to think, poor delusional Lori is at home primping for their date tonight, unaware that their love is a total sham.
Bobby::: Is this Giovanni Chang's Italian Mandarin Bistro? I'd like to make a reservation for tonight. Your most romantic table. We're celebrating something very special.
Lynn:::  Ugh. He's taking her to dinner? He's supposed to be taking Lori!
Lincoln::: Uh, not to mention he's getting married?
Lucy::: We have to tell Lori before it's too late.
Lynn::: It's too late! She must have already left!
Leni::: And she's not answering her cell!
Lincoln::: Well, if we can't get to Lori, at least we can get to Bobby.
Clyde:::  I hope he likes eating pumpkin through a straw!
Lynn::: There he is!
Lincoln::: Well, well, well. If it isn't the Pumpkin Eater. Celebrating your engagement, Roberto?
Bobby:::  My engagement? What?
Lola::: Oh, so you're not here with your fianc√©e? Then who did you bring?
Luna::: The blonde? The guy? The dog?!
Clyde:::  It's go-time, Romeo! 
Waiter::: Mama mia! The linguini dim sum!
Lori:::  Uh, what is going on?
Lori's siblings::: LORI?!
Luan::: What are you doing here?
Lori::: What are you doing here?
Lincoln::: I'm sorry you have to find out this way. Bobby's been cheating on you.
Lori and Bobby::: What are you talking about?!
Lincoln::: I'm talking about THIS!  Care to explain?
Bobby::: Sure.  That's my co-worker, Dana, from the department store. She was helping me pick out the dress and earrings I bought Lori.
Bobby:::  That's Monica, from my tour guide job. She was showing me the most romantic spots to take Lori to.  And that's Pam from my dry-cleaning job. She was fitting me for a tux.  Oh.  And that's Darin. I met him on the bus. He was teaching me how to dance.  And in case you were wondering, Clyde's neighbor is Teri, my co-worker at the pizzeria. She taught me how to order in Italian-Mandarin.
Clyde::: Oh, wow. So, I guess we were really wrong about the dog.
Lincoln::: Sorry, you guys. We got a little ahead of ourselves.
Lori:::  Well, you did almost ruin our anniversary! I oughta beat every one of you!
Lori:::  But, I appreciate all of you looking out for me.
Lincoln::: So, you're not mad?
Giovanni::: Ahem! I hate to break up this lovefest, but how do you intend to pay for my linguini dim sum?
Giovanni::: Hurry up with those kung pao anchovies!
Clyde::: Well, at least all that working out won't go to waste.
Lincoln:::  You loosened it.
Lincoln and Clyde:::  UGH!!!
