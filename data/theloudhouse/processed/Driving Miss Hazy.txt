Lincoln::: Come on, Lori! This is a lot of laundry! I don't think it's worth it.
Lori::: Do you want a ride to the comic book store or not?
Lincoln:::  Fine. 
Lori::: Whoa whoa whoa! Where are you going? Those are just my jeggings. Let me get the rest.  Wore that yesterday...wore that Tuesday...whoops! That definitely needs to be washed!
Lincoln:::  Lori's the only Loud kid with a driver's license. Which means that, in this house...  ...there's no such thing as a free ride.
Lisa::: In exchange for transporting me to the planetarium, I've done your calculus homework. Next time, I would appreciate a challenge.
Lucy::: Thanks for the ride to the cemetery. I finished your poem for your ten week anniversary. It's called Bobby.
Lori::: Let's hear it.
Lucy:::  Bobby, I thought you were a stalker. When you left brownies in my locker. Bobby-
Lana::: Hey, big sis!  I found your missing retainer in the garbage, and there was some perfectly good gum stuck to it! 
Lori::: So, where do you need a ride to?
Lana::: Ride? I just like digging in the trash.
Lori:::  Thank you, thank you, and thank...ew! See, Lincoln?  These guys respect our arrangement. Oh, and here are my dirty gym clothes, too.  And don't forget, I like the lavender scented dryer sheets. 
Lincoln:::  Sorry, Leni!  Yeowch!  What are you doing with all this stuff?
Leni::: I need a ride to the mall, so Lori told me to make her bed, which is weird, cause I'm pretty sure she already has one.
Lincoln::: Wait. Why are you doing chores for Lori? Aren't you old enough to drive yourself to the mall?
Leni::: Yeah, but I failed the driving test 12 times. Everyone's given up on teaching me. Dad's still mad about the Fire Hydrant Paperboy Nun Incident.
Flashback Leni::: Should I leave a note?
Lincoln::: What if I teach you to drive?
Leni:::  Wow! You have your license?
Lincoln::: Well, no, but I do have a crazy high score on...Total Turbo XXII, the world's awesomest racing video game!
Leni:::  FUN!  Wait. Are there nuns in it?
Lincoln::: Nun that I know of!  If I can help Leni get her license, she'll drive us anywhere! And Lori will have to wash her own jeggings.
Leni::: Wow! It's just like a real spinny thingy!
Lincoln::: Technically, it's called a steering wheel. So, you ready to get started?
Leni::: WAIT! I need my special driving outfit! 
Lincoln::: Great. So, can we get sta-
Leni::: WAIT! I need my special driving smoothie!  It's a soy pumpkin cookie crumble cream. It's seasonal!
Lincoln::: Great. So, now can we-
Leni::: WAIT!
Lincoln:::  What is it now?
Leni::: Aren't you gonna open the door for me? 
Lincoln:::  Click! Creak!
Leni::: What a gentleman. 
Lincoln::: Okay, all you have to do is keep the steering wheel straight, and you'll-
Leni::: Like that?
Lincoln::: Um...let's try again.
Lincoln::: Just keep the wheel straight.
Lincoln::: Okay, one more time.
Lincoln::: The road is straight, so keep the wheel straight.
Lincoln:::  Leni! You have to stay on the road!
Leni::: But, what's the point? We're not going anywhere fun!
Lincoln::: Sure we are! We're going to, uh...the mall!
Leni:::  Why didn't you say so?
Game announcer::: GAME ON!
Lincoln::: Wow! Go, Leni!
Leni:::  Move it, slowpoke! Mama needs a new driving dress! 
Lincoln:::  That was incredible!
Leni:::  Outta my way, granny!
Lincoln::: Easy there, Fast and Furious. 
Leni::: BUT I HAVE TO GET TO THE MALL!
Lincoln::: The mall can wait. You've got a driving test to pass. Go, Leni, go! Go, Leni, go!  Wait! The bus stop is that way!  Go, Leni, go! Go, Leni, go!
Lincoln::: Did you pass?
Cop::: No, she did not! She did, however, refuse to obey the speed limit, fail to use her turn signals, and she redirected the test vehicle toward the mall, where she proceeded to hip-check and tackle Mrs. Jelinsky!
Leni::: It's not fair! When I did all that in the game, I won! You guys need to get your rules straight! 
Lori:::  Lincoln, Lincoln, Lincoln. That's your plan? Teaching Leni to drive? She can't even drive a lawnmower.
Leni:::  AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!! MAKE IT STOP! AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!! 
Lori::: Trust me. You're gonna fail. You and Leni both. Now, where's Lynn? She owes me a pedicure. 
Lincoln:::  This isn't over yet. 
Lincoln::: Hey, Leni.  What are you doing?
Leni::: Going back to making Lori's bed.
Lincoln::: Nice craftsmanship. But you can't give up on driving. It was my fault you didn't pass the test.
Leni::: Maybe I'm just not meant to be behind the spinny thingy. You know?
Lincoln::: No. See, my video game approach was all wrong. Let me try a different method. 
Lincoln::: Okay, lesson one: preparing to drive.
Lynn::: Ah, you're teaching Leni to drive? Score! Can I help? I'm sick of sanding Lori's calluses! Ugh, barf! 
Lincoln::: Thanks, Lynn!
Lucy:::  Me too.  I can't write another poem for Bobby. I've run out of words that rhyme with 'babe'.
Lincoln:::  Thanks, Lucy...
Lola::: I can help!
Luna::: I'll help! I'll help!
Luan:::  Me, too! I wanna help!
Lana::: Me me me me!
Lisa::: I can be of assistance.
Lincoln::: Alright guys, we need to set it up like a real car.  Thanks, guys! Luna's bass drum is the brake. And Luan's whoopee cushion is the accelerator. 
Luan::: Accelerator? Don't you mean gas?  Get it?
Lincoln::: This golf club's the gear shift. The wreath is the steering wheel. Car horn, turn signal, and...oh! These keys...  ...are, well...the keys. Got all that?
Leni:::  Sure?
Others::: GREAT!
Lincoln::: Okay, first, fasten your seat belt.
Leni::: That was easy.
Lincoln::: Next, check your mirrors.
Leni:::  Why? Do I look bad?
Lincoln::: No, no, no, no. I meant-
Leni:::  Stop the car! I can't drive in this hideous condition!
Leni::: That's better!
Lincoln:::  Lesson 12: Avoiding road hazards. There's a squirrel in the road. What do you do?
Lincoln::: Use your turn signal!  No, that's the brake!  No, that's the gas!  No, that's my face!  This! This is the turn signal!
Leni::: Oh! You mean the blinky blink?
Lincoln:::  The... blinky blink?
Leni::: Yeah. It's right by the spinny thingy. 
Lincoln::: The spinny...  That's the problem! I haven't been speaking Leni!
Leni::: There's a country named after me?
Lincoln::: No. I mean, I haven't been using words you understand. Let me try again. Use the blinky blink.  Good. Now turn left.  I mean, turn to your good side.  Now we're getting somewhere! Hey, crew, we're gonna need some new car parts.
Lincoln::: This is a brake pedal. What does the brake pedal do? White shoes after Labor Day!
Leni::: Ew, stop!
Lincoln::: Exactly.
Luan:::  I gas you won't be needing this. 
Lincoln::: This is the gas pedal. What does the gas pedal do?  Boots from the 60's.
Leni::: Go-Go!
Lincoln:::  Yes! Leni, I think you're ready for the next level!
Lincoln::: Remember what we practiced, Leni!
Leni::: Go-go boot!  White shoe!  Go-go boot! 
Siblings:::  Whoa! Watch out!
Leni::: Good side! 
Lincoln::: She's doing it! Yeah, nice job, Leni!
Leni::: I'm doing it!
Lori::: Stupid jeggings!  Where is everybody?  LYNN! I'M STILL WAITING ON THAT PEDICURE!  I'm not giving up the car keys that easily.
Lincoln::: Night, Leni! You're gonna do great tomorrow! 
Leni::: Night, Lincoln! Night, Lori!
Lori::: Click.
Leni::: Got it! 
Recording::: Never check your mirrors. Always comment on your driving instructor's weight. In America, we drive on the left side of the road.
Lori:::  Ah! There you are! Don't you need a ride to the comic book store? And lavender sheets. Don't forget. 
Lincoln::: No, thanks.  I think I'll wait for Leni to get back from taking her driving test, with her new license.
Lori::: Pssht. She's not gonna pass. Now, get to washing. 
Lincoln:::  Actually, I'm pretty sure she will pass.
Lori::: No she won't. Because I made sure of it.
Lincoln:::  Wait. What?
Lori::: Nothing!
Lincoln::: Uh, no you don't!  So help me, Lori, I will shrink your favorite Bobby sweater in the dryer if you don't tell me what you-
Lori:::  STOP! FINE!  I might have sabotaged Leni by giving her bad driving instructions while she slept, but it's just because if Leni can drive, my room will never be clean and no one will ever need me for anything ever again! 
Lincoln::: Are you crazy, woman?! What if your bad driving instructions make Leni crash? What if she gets hurt?
Lori::: I didn't think of that...
Lincoln::: We gotta get to the DMV!
Lori:::  Oh, thank goodness, she's okay.
Lincoln:::  And maybe she passed!
Cop::: No, she did not! She did, however, drive on the wrong side of the road, neglected to check her mirrors and commented on the driving instructor's weight!
Leni:::  Well, that makes 14. Guess I'll have to drive a lawnmower forever.
Lincoln::: Look, Leni. It wasn't your fault.
Leni::: Yes, it was. You worked so hard to help me pass. You even learned to speak Leni. Which I still can't believe there's a country named after me.  I blew it. I was just thinking about all the fun places I would drive us to. The mall, the comic book store, the mall...I'm sorry I let you down.
Lori::: I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! It was my fault! I sabotaged your test.
Leni::::  Sabo...tage?
Lincoln::: It's like she went and bought the dress she knew you wanted.
Leni:::  HOW COULD YOU?!
Lori::: I'm really sorry, Leni. But I know how to make it up to you.
Leni:::  You'll buy me the dress?! 
Lincoln::: It was really nice of you to help Leni practice for her next test.
Lori:::  It's the least I could do.
Leni::: Is this the carpool lane?
