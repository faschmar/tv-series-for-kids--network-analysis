Lisa:::  Brain broccoli… Nope.”  Family fecal and hair samples… No.”  Sorry snakebird, genetic engineering is too pedestrian for a day this big.”  Combustible ketchup… No.”
Lincoln::: Lis...”  Aah!”  What's going on here? We heard the snakebird, and Mom sent me to check on Lily.”
Lisa::: Nah, she's fine.”
Lisa::: As you can see, I'm in the midst of a crisis of epic proportions, I'm slated to give a keynote research presentation at this year's Genius Con, and I have no new research to present.”
Lincoln::: Hmm... You know what always helps me think? A flippee.
Lisa::: I'm in extreme pain, but I have no additional neurological activity to report.”
Flip:::  Hey! What's with the sour face? Your goldfish die or something?”
Lisa::: Uh... there's a 500-pound steel drum on your foot.”
Flip::: Dang it! That's twice today.
Flip::: Hard work really gets my stomach grumbling. 
Lincoln::: Is that the same cheese we put on our nachos?
Flip:::  Eh. Cheese is cheese, Chief.”  Gah! My heart!
Lisa::: Far be it for me to question your ailment, but the heart is located in the thoracic cavity, in a space known as the mediastinum.”
Flip::: Ah, not Flip's. Mine's in my belly.”
Lisa::: Extraordinary pain tolerance, misplaced organs, and a diet consisting of mostly gas station cheese?”  Flip, how would you like to be the subject of my new research project?
Flip::: Ah, Flip ain't no science man.
Lisa::: My research will be presented at one of the largest scientific conferences in the world. It would be great publicity for the Food and Fuel!
Flip:::  Well, you got yourself a deal. 
Lisa:::  Wow. First, we'll need to run some routine tests!
Lisa::: Five minutes. That's amazing, Flip!  Now, we're going to see how you hold up in subzero temperatures.
Lisa::: Experts in every scientific field are at this conference.
Lincoln::: Hey. Sorry we're late.
Clyde::: We had a lengthy discussion about what 'smart casual' means.
Lisa::: What are you two sub-cranials doing here?
Flip::: They're here to do promotion. You got the samples?
Clyde::: Yep.
Lincoln::: And the new Flip's Food & Fuel pneumatic Flippee cannon!
Lisa::: Ugh. Just don't embarrass me. This is a big night for me.
Lincoln::: Come on, Lis'. We're pros. 
Lisa::: Sorry. Dr. McClouth!
Announcer::: Please welcome Lisa Loud!
Lisa::: Greetings, colleagues. I, Lisa Loud, Ph.D, JD, MD, and occasional DDS, present to you an epic discovery. I give you 'Anamalia Cordata Mammalia Flipia'!  Now, to the naked eye, an ordinary human male. But a closer look reveals something far different.  His liver is in his neck, his skin is one big callous, he has gills, his heart beats like no other...”  And last but certainly not least, my greatest discovery of all…”  The specimen has two posterior crevasses, street name… butt cracks!
Flip::: So head on down to Flip's Food 'n' Fuel after the show, come for the snacks, stay for the cracks.”
Lincoln::: Oh yeah!”
Clyde::: Flip's Food 'n' Fuel!”
Lincoln:::  Great job, Lis'!”
Dr. Linnaeus::: Bravo Ms. Loud, absolutely brilliant presentation.”  Dr. Carol Linnaeus, pleasure to meet you.”
Lisa:::  Incognito Laboratories? Never heard of it.”
Dr. Linnaeus::: Lisa, I'll be frank, your discovery may be the basis of a new field of science, we would love to do further research on your test subject at our facility. Just for a day or so.”
Lisa:::  I'm honored. What do you say, Flip?”
Flip::: Eh, I'm not interested.”
Lisa:::  Flip, I beg of you! I could be Lisa Loud, the mother of modern biology!”
Flip::: That's all fine and dandy for you, chief. But, uh, what's in it for old Flip there?”
Dr. Linnaeus::: Did I mention we pay handsomely?”
Flip::: I'm in! Eh, thanks for calling me handsome.” 
Dr. Linnaeus::: Eh, okay.”  If I could just have your initial here, we'll be on our way.”
Flip:::  Thanks short stack, between the cash and free publicity. Ooh, I owe you big time.”  Now you boys watch the Food 'n' Fuel 'til I get back.”
Lincoln & Clyde::: Aye, aye, Flip!”
Dr. Linnaeus:::  Now, please come with me.”
Lisa::: Hmm… Let's see what you're all about.”  Dr. Linnaeus.”  No results found? Hmm. That's odd. How about, uh…  'Incognito Laboratories?”  Aha. You can't hide from me.”  Ah! Well, it's confirmed, there's something very wrong here.”
Lily::: Kitty-cat.” 
Lisa::: That's not a kitty, that's a rat.”  And there's something attached to his collar.”  A business card from Incognito Labs, and there's a message… Halp? Who would mispell help?”  This is from Flip.”  And it reeks of saline, he's… he's been crying.”  Take me to him, Rattus.”
Lisa::: I have a visual.”  Have they no humanity? They're treating Flip like a lab rat!”  What? Are you giving me that look 'cause I've offended you as a lab rat?  Or is it because I treated Flip the exact same way?” 
Lisa::: Why are you still holding Flip?!”
Dr. Linnaeus::: If you're referring to Test Subject: 599, we're prepping it for a very important mission… Incognito Labs specializes in aeronautics and astronomy. Street name…”
Lisa:::  Don't 'street name' me. I know what space travel is.”
Dr. Linnaeus::: We've long wondered how the human body would hold up unprotected in space. We just never had the right test subject, until now.”
Lisa:::  You mean?”
Dr. Linnaeus::: We're gonna shoot the subject into space without a spacesuit. And what are you on about? This is not our first horrific torture session.”
Lisa:::  But the g-force alone would obliterate him!”
Dr. Linnaeus::: You said it yourself, it's barely human. Meeting adjourned.”
Lisa::: Listen, lady, I'm not going anywhere until you let Flip go!”  Oh no.”
Lisa::: Gentlemen,”  I'm here on a matter of grave importance. The scientists who took Flip are planning on shooting him into space, and I need your help breaking him out of their lab before they can.”
Lincoln::: We're in.”
Lisa::: Pray tell, what happened in here?”
Lincoln::: The flippee machine exploded.”
Lisa::: Hmm… I think I have an idea.”
Lisa::: Radioactive waste coming through.”
Guard::: Got ID?”  Ah, hi, Dr. Inn, nice to see you, come on in.”  Did you hear?”
Lisa::: Achoo!”  Allergy season.”
Lincoln::: Cheese me.”
Guard:::  Hey, how did you kids get in here?”
Lisa::: Ice this fool!”
Lincoln:::  Go for Flip, we'll keep 'em busy.”
Lisa:::  You got it.”
Lincoln:::  Time for these guys to chill.”
Flip::: Ah, alright! You got Sal's message!”
Lisa:::  Hello again, little Salvador. Now come on, Flip, we need to get you out of here.”
Flip::: No can do half-pint, this cell is locked with the most complex passcode on Earth.”
Lisa:::  Passcode… Incognito Labs… Incognito in latin spelled backwards is…”  Yes!”
Flip:::  Hey.”
Lisa::: Come on!”
Dr. Linnaeus::: Not so fast.”
Flip::: Ah, crud.”
Dr. Linnaeus::: Don't be a fool, Lisa, you're walking away from fame, fortune... all for a test subject?”
Lisa::: No, Doc! That's where I had it wrong! He's not a test subject, he's a human being who deserves to be treated with respect!
Flip::: Wow, I didn't know there were trains coming out of both tunnels.”
Lisa::: And by the way, his name is Flip. Now step aside!”
Dr. Linnaeus::: I can't let you do this! That's my test subject now!”
Lisa::: Flip, help!”
Flip::: My emergency flippee!”
Lincoln::: Way to go, Lisa! You did it!”
Automated Voice::: Launch initiated.”
Flip::: Awe, thanks for savin' old Flip's bacon.”
Clyde::: This calls for celebratory flippees!”
Flip:::  Brain freeze!”
