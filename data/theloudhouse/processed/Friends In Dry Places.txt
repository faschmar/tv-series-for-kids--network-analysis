Lincoln::: Hey, Lynn!  Oof! 
Lynn::: Oh, sorry, bro!
Lincoln:::  I'm okay.  Can I borrow your sleeping bag? Lana's snake gave birth in mine.
Lynn:::  Ugh. Gross. Eh, no prob.  All yours! 
Lincoln::: Ugh... Maybe I'll just sleep on the floor...  Tomorrow is the Fifth Grade trip to Big Bear Dunes National Park!
Lynn::: Ah, yes, Michigan's Gold Coast: the most baller of all the coasts.
Lincoln::: I can't wait! It's the last field trip of Elementary School, and my friends and I are really gonna go out with a bang!  Wha, wow... Can you move that sleeping bag?
Lynn::: Oh-ho, I remember that trip.  So many fond memories...
Lincoln::: Who's that girl you're bench-pressing?
Lynn::: My bunkmate, Sherry...? No, no, no, Shirley? Wait, Toni maybe? Yeah, I can't remember the names of people I'm not friends with anymore. We were close in fifth grade, but once you get to middle school, everything changes, even your friend group. 
Lincoln::: Pfft... That won't happen to me and my friends. We're like siblings! We're gonna be close forever!
Lynn::: That's if you make it out alive.  Better take this for the bears.
Lincoln:::  Bears?
Lincoln::: Wow...
Lincoln::: It's so beautiful! And it's so peaceful.
Cheryl::: Okay, y'all little jitterbugs, your cabin assignments are goin' up on the activity board.
Lincoln::: Huh? 
Clyde::: Come on, buddy.
Lincoln:::  Did Cheryl say cabin assignments?
Lincoln::: I thought we get to pick who we bunk with!  Let's see who I'm bunking with.  Mmm... Principal Huggins? You gotta be kidding me!
Clyde::: Thanks, guys. Let's do another coat in an hour.
Lincoln:::  Okay, let's not panic over the assigned bunk sitch. I'll work some of my Loud Magic, and we'll all be bunking together in no time.
Liam::: Actually, I'm happy as a skeeter in a sauna to bunk with Trent! He snuck in a whole mess of juice boxes with him.
Trent::: Shh!
Lincoln & Zach:::  Oooh!
Zach::: I'm rooming with Hassan! He takes security as seriously as I do.  Check out what he brought! 
Lincoln::: A vacuum?
Hassan's robot::: Threat detected.
Lincoln::: Ahh!
Zach::: No, it's the latest in-home security technology.
Clyde::: I'm with Richie, but I'm actually OK with it! He brought in an air purifier, and you know how I am with pollen. Sorry, buddy!
Stella::: And I'm in the girls' bunk with Girl Jordan.
Rusty::: Hey, look what Lance and me found in our bunk! Someone left a crate full of awesome random stuff!  Huh? Check out this hat! Score!
Lincoln::: Great. So I'm not rooming with any of my friends.
Lynn Jr.::: But once you get to Middle School, everything changes. Even your friend group.
Lincoln::: Nah, that wouldn't happen to us.
Cheryl::: Chop chop! Y'all need to meet up at your first activity station in ten minutes.
Lincoln::: Sweet. At least we all signed up to go Sand Boogey Boarding together.
Rusty::: Yikes! Not a hat! Ahh!
Lincoln::: Where is everybody?  I'll just Boogey my own board...
Lincoln::: Where could they be?!
Lincoln::: Clyde? I thought we were all gonna go sand boogey boarding together.
Clyde::: Well, yeah, but then Richie sold me on making cherry jam. It's a real hoot, if you can stand the pain of the cherry pits.  Ow! Ow! You should taste some.  It's delicious. 
Lincoln:::  Ugh! I'm not eating your toe jam.
Clyde::: Come on. 
Lincoln:::  Actually, that's not bad.
Lincoln::: Stella? I thought we were all gonna go hang out! 
Stella::: Well, we found out Cheryl used to drive in Daytona, so... 
Cheryl::: Sorry about comin’ in hot, punkin'. There is somethin’ about an all terrain vehicle that makes ol’ Cheryl crave the need for speed! Wooh!  LET'S RIDE! YEE-HAW! 
Lincoln::: Huh?  
Hassan's robot::: Spy detected. 
Liam:::  ...oh, delicious.
Lincoln::: Finally!  We’ve been at the park a whole day and this is the first time we’ve all been together!  ...wait, where’s Rusty? 
Rusty::: I know I’m late. Let’s just say I had a run-in with a hungry turtle... Sorry, Lance! 
Lincoln::: It’s okay! Just -  ...wait, did you call me... Lance? 
Rusty::: My bad, bro, must’ve forgotten your name for a second. 
Lynn::: I can’t remember the names of people I’m not friends with anymore... 
Clyde::: AH! 
Clyde::: Lincoln? 
Lincoln:::  Hey, buddy...  
Clyde::: Shh. You'll wake up Richie!  What are you doing here? And sorry for the whack. 
Lincoln::: Normally, I wouldn't dream of waking you, but it's an emergency. 
Clyde::: Are the cats missing?!  Did my dads sell the house without telling me?!  It's Nana Gayle, isn't it?! 
Lincoln::: Worse. We're losing our friends.  Think about it: no one wanted to bunk together, we all did separate activities, Rusty forgot my name!  Lynn warned me about this. Once you hit Middle School, your friend group falls apart. 
Clyde::: This is bad news. But what can we do? 
Lincoln::: I'm thinking a hike to the dunes tomorrow. We'll make some memories and bring the group back together.  
Clyde::: But everyone has already signed up to do other activities. 
Lincoln::: Not for long...
Lincoln::: Clyde, you cross everybody off their activity list, and I'll sign 'em up for our hike. 
Lincoln:::   Job well done, buddy... Huh? Clyde, your knuckles are very hairy. 
Clyde::: Um, Lincoln? That's not me...
Lincoln::: Wait. Lynn's lacrosse stick! 
Cheryl:::  Go on! Get those bear buns out of here!  What are y'all little hoot owls doing out of your bunks? 
Lincoln::: Just, uhh...  Looking for my lacrosse stick. Oh, it's, uh, it's, uh, over there.
Clyde::: And now, we can sleep in peace.
Cheryl:::  Mm-hmm. 
Lincoln::: All set, Clyde? 
Clyde::: Packed and ready.  Oh, ah, oh! 
Lincoln::: Oh, hey guys. I didn't know you signed up for this hike.
Rusty::: I didn't sign up for this hike, and yet I'm here.
Stella::: Same. 
Liam::: Me too. 
Lincoln::: Well, look on the bright side. Now we can all spend the afternoon together. Should we get going? 
Clyde:::  Whoo-hoo! Let's do this!  Uhh, uhh, oh! Little help? 
Liam:::  I'm sweatier than a sow in labor.
Zach:::  Yeah. My fair skin isn't meant for this brutal sun!
Rusty::: I hate hiking!
Clyde::: Uh! Not again! 
Lincoln:::  At least we're together, right?
Lincoln::: Don't worry, guys!  There should be a path this way that'll take us back to the bunks.  ...oooooor is it that way?
Stella::: You sure you know where we're going?
Clyde::: Yeah. Everything around here looks exactly the same.
Lincoln::: Hmm... Now that you mention it, I'm not entirely sure WHERE we're are.
Zach::: Okay, let's draw straws...  ...in case we have to eat someone.
Lincoln:::  No one is eating anyone!  We just have to work together to find a way back to camp. The good news is...
Lincoln::: ...we'll always remember this exact moment that bonded us forever. Should we take a picture?
Lincoln::: Got it... Not the right time.  Liam, I need you in charge of hydration.
Liam::: Just call me the Juice Daddy. 
Lincoln::: Stella, I need you to look for familiar landmarks.
Lincoln::: Anything that'll lead us back to camp. Clyde, I need you to... 
Clyde::: Uh... uh...
Lincoln::: ...uh, we'll come back to you.  Zach, you're in charge of collecting food.
Zach:::  Wait, you're telling me Clyde doesn't have anything to eat in that ginormous backpack?
Clyde::: Just...  ...bugspray...  sunscreen... Gah!  ...lip balm...
Zach::: Huh. What flavor lip balm?
Lincoln::: Rusty, I need you to find a way to send out an SOS signal.
Rusty::: Initiating hair-tenna protocol.
Lincoln::: Isn't this exciting, Clyde? We're gonna remember this forever!  Look, bud, keep this between the two of us. We're not actually lost.
Clyde::: We're not?
Lincoln::: No! I just thought working together would bring us back together.  Don't worry, I have the map.
Lincoln::: Don't worry, I'll just go... grab it.
Lincoln::: Uh... okay, now you can worry. We're actually lost.
Stella:::  What do you mean 'actually'?
Lincoln::: So I MAY have pretended that we were lost... because I may have been trying to bring us closer together. But now we may actually be lost...
The friend group except Clyde::: What?!
Lincoln::: I promise this wasn't part of the plan. Tell 'em, Clyde!
Stella::: Clyde?! You were in on this?!
Clyde::: I didn't know he was gonna get us lost! I just helped him cross your names on the activity list!
Zach::: You crossed our names off the activity list?!
Rusty::: VERY uncool, Lincoln.
Lincoln:::  I can explain!
Stella::: You've done enough. I'm getting out of here.  Anyone who wants to go back to the bunks? Follow me.
Rusty::: My luscious locks say this way.
Liam::: My Mee-Maw always says, 'If you're lost in the hot sauce, the North Star's your boss.
Zach::: Uh, it's daytime, dude.
Liam::: Mee-Maw never lies!
Lincoln::: Guys! Wait!
Clyde::: I'm going this way. The pollen count... seems lower...
Lincoln::: We should stick together!  STELLA! COME BACK! Rusty?!
Lincoln::: Aww...
Lincoln::: Huh?  The map!
Lincoln::: Dang it...
Lincoln::: HELP! HEEEEEEEELP!!!
The Friend Group::: LINCOLN!
Lincoln::: Hopefully someone sees my distress signal...
Clyde::: I'd recognize this underwear anywhere!
Lincoln::: Clyde!
Clyde::: GUYS!  He's over here!  Hold tight, buddy.
Clyde::: We'll get you out! INITIATE CHAIN FORMATION!
Clyde::: I got 'em! Bring me up!
Liam::: You okay there, fella?
Lincoln::: Better now that you guys are here. I'm sorry for scheming behind your backs. Lynn told me that when you go to Middle School, you lose all your friends. And I was afraid that was happening to us.
Zach::: Pssh. No way.
Lincoln::: But everyone was doing their own thing this weekend.
Stella::: We were just trying new stuff. But that doesn't mean we won't be friends.
Liam::: Sure thing! We'll always be tight as a gaggle o' geese.
Lincoln::: Thanks, guys. Now bring it in!
Lincoln::: Not to ruin the moment, but, uh, technically we're still lost.
Rusty::: ...huh?
Cheryl::: There, y'all, my li'l sand crabs! Hop on! I'll give y'all a lift back!
Stella::: But we can't all fit!
Clyde:::  I have the solution! 
Lincoln::: I'm so glad we worked things out, guys! Nothing can separate us now.
Lincoln::: Guys! Wait up!
