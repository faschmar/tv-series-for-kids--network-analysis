Cheryl::: Lexi Rose, check. Ashlynn, check. Lola Loud... whuh? Where's Miss Lola?
Lola:::  Can't see... too many feather boas!
Cheryl::: What'd you-
Lola:::  It's Cricket Van Doren!  A pageant legend!  Ah, she is so international.  Cricket's won every crown on every continent, including Little Miss Ice Float in Antarctica!  I have to meet her!  OK, Lola. Play it suave and digni-  -FIIIIIIED!  Oh, dang runaway rhinestone! Guess it's gone forever. Hi, I'm Lola. It's a pleasure to meet you. 
Cricket:::  I'm Cricket. To mou plaisir est pour moi. The pleasure is mine. 
Lola::: Ooh, French. I love the French.
Cricket::: I adore Paris. Have you ever been?
Lola::: Um, have I ever not been? I'm always getting over on a whim. 
Cricket:::  You're funny, Lola.
Lola::: Thanks. My family and I love traveling the globe. I find that it helps me unwind, especially after a super-stressful pageant win, am I right? 
Cricket::: Me, too. I spent a month in Vienna after winning Little Miss Strudel. Wow, we have so much in common! Any chance you're free tomorrow? We should hang out!
Lola:::  Heck yeah!  I mean, positively.
Cricket::: Oh, I just remembered. My parents are hosting a charity polo match in our backyard. Can we do your house?
Lola:::  Uh...  No! Uh, tomorrow's our butler's day off! We'd have to take off our own shoes, ugh.
Cricket::: Oh, I don't mind. Besides, I'd love to gab with your family about your world travels. Au revoir, Lola! See you tomorrow! 
Lola:::  Oh no.
Lana::: Sit, sit!
Lincoln:::  Ah, smells great, Clyde. Thanks for cooking for us tonight.
Clyde::: Thank you guys for letting me do a test run. My dads and I are hosting the Operatic Society, and we all know how they can be.  They're fussy eaters.  I give you the elegant Parisian dish coq au vin.
Lola:::  Elegant and Parisian?! Hmm.
Clyde::: Glad you enjoyed--  Hey, who ate one of the wheels off my cart?!
Lynn:::  My bad.
Lola::: Clyde, how would you like to make another practice meal? My friend would love your corky van! We can even come over to your house!
Clyde::: Hmm... that's actually a great idea. And my dads can be there, too. Uh... As long as it's not tomorrow. That's the day they do all their organic produce shopping.
Lola::: We can only do tomorrow. Socialites are always booked solid. 
Clyde::: Well, I guess it'll be okay without them, but be warned, we're low on watercress.  Oh, come on!
Lola::: Clyde, this table is exquisite! Cricket will be so impressed.
Clyde::: Thanks.  The macaroons are ready.
Lola:::  I'll get it!  Cricket, darling, welcome!
Cricket::: Thanks for having me, Lola! 
Lola::: Both cheeks, how continental.  So, this is my house, where I live, with my family.
Cricket::: I can't wait to meet them.
Lola::: My dads are sorry they can't be here. They had to fly to London. Royal stuff. And my brother is prepping lunch. So, how about a tour?  Ugh, our dads are always making us do new family portraits.
Cricket::: Aw, how sweet.  Hmm. Weird. Your head looks bigger than the others.
Lola::: I, uh, yeah, I had a head cold that day.  And here we have the living room where my dads insist that I showcase my awards.
Cricket::: Oh, I love cats! What are their names? 
Lola:::  Uh, Growly...  ...and Hissy.
Clyde::: Ladies, lunch is ready.
Cricket::: Oh, bonjour. I'm Cricket. It's a pleasure to meet Lola's bro-
Lola:::  AAH! GIANT SPIDER! Hurry, let's go before it eats us! 
Lola::: Oopsie, out of tea. I'll make more.
Clyde::: It's in the cabinet above-
Lola:::  I know where the tea is, silly. Boop! 
Cricket::: Clyde, these crepes are delicieuse.
Clyde::: Merci. It's a recipe my Nana Gayle picked up while she was in France.
Cricket::: Oh. Do you and Lola see her often?
Clyde::: Uh, Lola never sees Nana Gayle--
Lola::: As much as I'd like to!  Oh, Nana.
Cricket::: Thanks again for a superb lunch.
Lola:::  Welcome home, you two!
Harold:::  Uh, thank you, Lola.
Lola:::  C'mon, Cricket, I'll walk you out! 
Cricket:::  Uh, nice to meet you.
Cricket::: I had a lot of fun today, Lola.
Lola::: Yeah, me too.
Cricket::: Hey, you wanna hang out tomorrow?  We can go to the mall.
Lola:::  Mm-hmm!
Cricket::: Magnifique! I'll see you then! 
Howard:::  Am I blanking, or was Lola on that Hawaiian cruise with us last year?
Lola::: Hi there, Cri-  AAH! What are you guys doing here?!
Lincoln::: Mom and Dad dropped all of us off so they can go to run errands.
Lynn::: Go, go, go!
Cricket::: Hey there, Lola. Oh, your brother, what a nice surprise.
Lincoln:::  Uh, thank you-
Cricket:::  Bonjour, monseiur. 
Lola:::   Well, better go. Those sales won't shop themselves! C'mon! 
Lincoln:::  Well, that was strange.
Lola::: You know what, let's forget the mall. How about a spa day? I'll pay.
Cricket::: Oh, that sounds wonderful, but I can't. I promised my mom I'd get an outfit for our Labradoodle's birthday gala. You can help, Lola.
Lola:::  Leni, please don't be working, please don't be working...
Cricket::: Ooh. Okay, what do you think about this?
Lola:::  Love it, hurry, buy it.
Cricket::: Uh, I'm not that big on the color.
Leni:::  Hey!  Hi, I'm Leni. I can totes help! When it comes to fashion, I have a psychic gift.  Aha!
Cricket::: Ooh! Wait, let me get my friend's opinion-  Hey, where'd she go?
Cricket::: That Leni was so helpful.
Lola::: Sorry, I would've helped, too, but I valeted my limo and forgot to tip.
Game announcer::: Nice brick!
Lola::: Oops, it's a stretch limo, so I didn't tip enough. BRB!  Done so soon?
Lynn:::  I'm outta ding-dang cash.
Lola:::  Here, let Lola help.
Cricket:::  Wait, did you change your clothes?
Lana:::  Yeah, like two weeks ago!
Cricket::: Wait, how are you here? You were just over there!
Lola::: Sweetie, Lola Loud is everywhere!  Now let's go get some food, I am starving! 
Lola:::  I know, right? I thought it was pretty funny too.
Luan::: Oh, hey, Lola. We were just wondering-
Lola::: Yes, it's me, Lola Loud! Of course you can have an autograph!  You have to make time for the fans.
Mr. Coconuts:::  Hey! That dame owes us a new slice!
Lola::: Ooh, calendars! I definitely need one of these to keep track of all my parties and soirees.  C'mon, let's go to the photobooth! 
Cricket::: Uh, this is fun...  ..Lola. But are we...  ..done?  It's been an hour and my cheeks are...  ..sore.
Lola::: The coast is clear! I mean, I'm sure one of our photos came out. 
Cricket::: Look, there are your dads.
Lola:::  My eyes are shut in every photo, we better take more come on.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Harold::: Well hello, girls.
Cricket::: Ah, bonjour. Lola didn't tell me you'd be here today, too.
Harold::: We came to pick up Clyde, but got a little distracted by a sale. Lamps are a weakness of ours.
Howard::: If you girls need a ride home we can drop you off. In fact, Lola, we drive right by your...  ..Uh... house on our way to our place.
Cricket::: Wait, her house? Your place?  I don't understand, what are your dads talking about, Lola?
Harold::: Wait, what? We're not her dads.
Howard::: Where'd you get an idea like that?
Cricket::: So, you lied to me? I thought we were friends, Lola.
Lola::: But... 
Lola::: Cricket? Are you in there?  Even when she's sad she looks perfect.  Look, I'm really sorry I lied. The McBrides aren't my family, and I've never been to Paris. I wanted to impress you so you'd be my friend. My real family can be... well... kind of, a lot. I was worried they'd embarrass me in front of you. But that's no excuse for what I did. If you let me, I can fix this.
Lola:::  This is my family.
Lynn::: Go long.
Lana::: El Diablo, hey, no, no, no, no.
Cricket::: They seem fun.
Lola::: Really? You don't wanna run away?
Cricket::: No way. Having to always be so prim and proper and sophisticated with my family, sometimes it's nice to be able to just... cut loose.
Lana::: No, El Diablo, hey.
Cricket:::  I love snakes.  What's his name?
Lana::: Bad El Diablo! Spit out Lola's friend, right now!
