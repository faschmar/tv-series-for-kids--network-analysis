Luan::: And finally, the motion to ration shampoo due to chronic shortages passed... by a hair! 
Lori::: So, the minutes from our last meeting are approved.  Any new business?  Anyone? Anyone? No one?
Lincoln:::  Lori!
Lori::: I'm just messing with you. Lincoln has the floor.
Lincoln::: As you all know, our annual trip to Scratchy Bottom Campgrounds is quickly approaching.
Lynn::: That place is the worst. Bears always steal our food.
Leni::: And we have to sleep on the hard ground!
Lola::: And poop in the woods!
Lana::: I like pooping in the woods.
Lisa::: And the Dipterum Culicidae are the size of Mustelas Nivalis.  The mosquitoes are the size of weasels.
Lincoln:::  And don't forget the scary hill people hiding in the trees! 
Lori::: There's no such thing as hill people, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: My point is, why can't we go someplace different like...  ...Aloha Beach or Dairyland Amusement Park?
Lori::: Because Mom and Dad will never go for it.
Lincoln::: How do we know? We've never asked.
Lori::: Fine. All in favor of Lincoln wasting his time and asking Mom and Dad?
Lori:::  Motion passes. 
Rita::: Fine with us, sweetie.
Lynn Sr.::: Sure, son. I don't see why not.
Lori::: So? Which is it? Aloha Beach or Dairyland?
Lincoln::: Oh. They didn't say. I guess it's up to us to decide. All in favor of Aloha Beach?  One, two, three, four, five...
Luna:::  You wanna go to the beach, Lucy?
Lucy::: Two words: Shark Attacks.
Lincoln::: All in favor of Dairyland?  One, two, three, four, five.
Leni::: It's five against five! We win!
Lynn:::  It's a tie, Leni.
Lola::: Wait a minute. Lincoln didn't vote.
Lori::: Well, Lincoln, what's it gonna be?
Lincoln::: It's so hard to choose. I really like the beach.  But I love Dairyland.  I don't know. I can't decide. I need more time. Can I have till the end of the day?
Lori::: Fine. You have until the end of the day to decide. 
Lincoln:::  Now I've done it. If I choose Aloha Beach, five of my sisters are gonna be mad at me. And if I choose Dairyland, the other five will be mad. Making a decision is gonna be rough.
Lola::: Hey, Linky. I brought you something!  A short stack from your favorite short stack! You should never make a big decision on an empty stomach.
Lincoln::: Wow! Thanks, Lola! 
Lynn::: Hey, little bro. I was just thinking. With all the pressure you're under to decide...  ...maybe a massage would help you relax. HIYA! 
Lincoln:::  Uh...this is awkward. Down a little...I carry most of my stress in my lower back...Aw...
Lori::: Shower time.
Lincoln::: Huh?
Lori::: Take a nice long one. I cleared the bathroom schedule. 
Lincoln::: Wait. You guys aren't trying to get my vote for Aloha Beach, are you?
Lori, Lola, and Lucy:::  No.
Lily::: No, no, no.
Leni::: Wait! I thought we were!
Lincoln::: Cleaning my room? You guys aren't trying to get my vote for Dairyland, are you?
Luna, Luan, Lynn, and Lana:::  What? No no no.
Luan::: Now that's funny.
Lisa:::  Of course, we are.
Lincoln:::   I amend my earlier statement. Deciding on where to go for our vacation might not be so rough after all.
Aloha Beach Girls::: Aloha, Lincoln!
Lincoln::: What's that?
Leni::: It's your homework. All done.
Lincoln:::  Uh...you did it?
Lori::: I did.
Lincoln::: Phew...I mean, not that it matters.
Luan::: Hiya, Lincoln! 
Lincoln::: Tippy the Cow!
Luan::: Well, that's right!  And guess what I have for my favorite fan! 
Lincoln::: You did my laundry? Wow! Thanks, Tippy!
Luan::: You're welcome!  I'll see you soon at America's favorite dairy themed a-moo-sement park! 
Lincoln::: Bye, Tippy! I love that cow.
Lori::: Welcome to your own private beach. Where we have sun, sand, and surf. 
Lucy::: Don't forget screams.
Lori::: And if you vote Team Beach, the fun will literally never stop.
Leni::: Yeah. If you need anything else, just give us a toot. 
Lincoln::: What's happening?!
Lynn::: ALL ABOARD THE I SCREAMER!
Lisa::: Please keep your arms and legs inside the ride at all times.
Lincoln::: WOO-HOO! FASTER! FASTER!
Luna::: Hope you enjoyed the ride, bro.
Luan::: If you vote for Dairyland, you'll have two percent more fun! 
Lisa::: If you require our services...  ...just call on Team Tippy.
Lynn::: Alright, Lincoln, your time's up. What's it gonna be?
Lincoln::: I know I said I'd decide by the end of the day, but I'm still torn. Can I have just one more day?
Lola:::  Why, you lousy little-
Lori:::  Uh...not a problem.  We understand.
Lincoln:::  Can you blame me? No matter what I decide, five of them are still gonna be mad at me. But this day has been amazing. So I figure, why not take advantage of it a little longer?
Lori::: Ugh. What are we going to do, you guys? We need to try harder to show him why the beach is better.
Lola:::  Or...maybe we should show him why Dairyland is worse...
Lincoln::: Gotta pee, gotta pee, gotta pee! Note to self: no more cocoa before bed!  What's going on?
Lucy::: Waiting in line for the bathroom. Better get used to standing in lines if you're gonna vote for Dairyland.
Lincoln::: What?  Sorry! This ride is temporarily closed?! NOOOOOOOOO!!!
Lynn:::  Oh, so that's how they wanna play...
Lincoln::: Ah...sweet relief!
Lincoln::: AAAAAHHHH!!! FREEZING!!! What happened to all the hot water?
Lynn::: You'd better get used to it if you vote for the Beach.
Lisa::: Because the average ocean temperature is 16.6 degrees Celsius.
Lincoln::: Uh, guys, FYI. Sand in my crack does not make me want to vote for the beach!
Lincoln::: Guys! Guys! Too fast! Too fast, guys! Guys, too fast! I'M GONNA HURL!!!
Lincoln::: Word of advice. Blowing chunks does not make me want to vote for Dairyland!
Lincoln:::  SPF 800 sunscreen. Perfect for my fair skin.  Hm. Tingly.
Lincoln::: News flash! Giving me a sunburn is not the way to win my vote!
Lori::: Huh?  Sodium Hydrochlorite: Avoid contact with skin? This has Lisa written all over it!
Leni::: So that's how you spell Lisa?
Lincoln::: Tippy!
Lincoln::: Mad cow! Mad cow!
Lori::: Well?
Lucy::: Worked like a charm. Aloha Beach is in our future.
Luan:::  We knew it! You've been sabotaging us!
Lori:::  We sabotaged you? You put sand in Lincoln's underpants!
Lana:::  But you started it with the line for the bathroom!
Lincoln:::  Can I get an ice pack? Some bandages? A hug? Where is everybody?
Lincoln::: I'm blowing the conch, I'm ringing the bell, and yet, nothing!
Lynn:::  YOU! This is all your fault!
Lori:::  Yeah! If you had just made up your mind, none of this would have happened!
Lincoln:::  Great. I was afraid of making five of my sisters mad at me. But now all ten are! There's only one thing left to do.
Rita::: Fine with us, sweetie.
Lynn Sr.::: Sure, son. I don't see why not.
Lincoln:::  Quiet down! I've made my decision! We're going to...Scratchy Bottom Campgrounds!
Sisters::: WHAT?!
Lynn::: But what about the bears?!
Lisa::: And the Dipterum Culicidae bites?
Lola::: And the pooping in the woods?
Lana::: That's still the only reason I'd go.
Lori:::  Ugh. This is literally going to be the worst vacation EVER!
Lori:::  This is literally the best vacation ever!
Luna::: Why were we so against this place? 
Lincoln:::  It may not be much of a vacation for me, but it's worth it if all ten of my sisters are happy. I'd say everything turned out A-okay.
Lincoln:::  THE HILL PEOPLE HIDING IN THE TREES!!!
