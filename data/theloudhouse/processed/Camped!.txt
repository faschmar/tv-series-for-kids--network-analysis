Luan:::  Blegh.
Lincoln::: Do these eggs seem... blegh!
Lola::: Soggy?
Lana::: I kinda like them.
Lynn and Lisa::: Blegh.
Lori::: Uh, Dad?
Lynn Sr.:::  Sorry, kids...  I just got the email that every adult dreads.
Lori::: What happened?
Lucy::: When's the funeral?
Lynn Sr.:::  Camp Mastodon, my old family camp...  ...is closing!! 
Lola:::  Yeah, that sounds like an after-breakfast problem.  What? You know I'm more sympathetic on a full stomach.
Lynn Sr.:::  Me and my Dad - y-your Gramps - used to go every year when I was a kid. We made so many memories at Camp Mastodon...
Lynn Sr.::: It's where I learned to run...
Leonard::: We did it!
Younger Lynn Sr.:::  Yeah!
Lynn Sr.::: It's where I learned to swim...
Lynn Sr.::: It's where I learned to fly!
Younger Lynn Sr.::: Whoo!
Lynn Sr.::: Now I have to call Gramps and tell him that it's closing...
Leonard::: H...hello?
Lola::: Ooh, Gramps is hairier than I remember...
Leonard::: Ah!
All Kids and Lynn Sr.::: Gramps!
Leonard::: Ahoy! How are my eleven favorite little minnows doing, huh?  You... can you... 
Lynn Sr.::: Ah, dang it. He must still be on that fishing boat in the Bering Sea.  Oh! Lisa, can I borrow your telegraph? I'm going to try Morse code.  Another skill I learned at...  ...camp!
Luna::: Aw... poor Pops. Wish there was something we could do to cheer him up.
Lola::: Daddy mani-pedi day? Ooh, I'll call Gayle. She's the cuticle whisperer, heh heh.
Lincoln::: Or... we can take him to Camp Mastodon. He can make one more family memory before it closes.
Lola:::  Sorry, Gayle, false alarm.  Of course I'm still keeping MY appointment.
Louds::: LYNN!
Lynn::: Not my fault. You're the ones who dared me to drink a whole bottle of hot sauce.
Luna::: Sweet.
Lincoln::: This is awesome!
Louds::: Flip?
Flip::: Eh, hey there Louds!
Lincoln::: What the heck is Flip doing here?
Lynn Sr.::: Flip was a Mastodon kid too!
Flip::: Mastodon! 
Lynn Sr. and Flip::: Da-da, eh, eh, eh, ooh!
Lynn Sr.::: Good to see you back here, Flip! Where's Mama Phillipini?
Flip::: Eh, she's on a Casseroles of America cruise. I wasn't about to miss Mastodon's swan song! 'Ey, last one to pee in the lake is a Michigan Brook Trout! 
Lynn Sr.::: Okay, see ya!  No one swim in there for an hour. Okay, who wants the camp tour?
Lynn Sr.::: That's where Gramps and I did our father-son talent show routine... O-ooh, that's where we tag-teamed campfire stories.  And that's where we -- that's where we... accidentally wiped with poison ivy!  I'm itchy just remembering it... So many great memories --
Lynn Sr.:::  Mr. Rinsler!!
Mr. Rinsler::: Welcome back, Lynnie! 
Lynn Sr.:::  Guys, this is the camp owner, Mr. Rinsler!
Mr. Rinsler::: Heh heh... Nice to meet you, Louds.  Happy to have you here one final time.
Lincoln::: This place is so cool!
Luna::: Thanks for havin' us, man.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, it's a ding-dang shame this place is closing down...
Mr. Rinsler::: Yeah, I hate to see it go, but I can't afford the upkeep anymore.  Well, I should get back to packing up the office...
Lynn Sr.::: Do you need any help? We'd be happy to pitch in. Right, everybody?
Lincoln::: Ooh, there's a s'more station!  Aah!
Lynn Sr.::: Lincoln and I will help you. Right, Linc?
Lincoln::: Sure thing... heh heh.
Mr. Rinsler::: Excellent news.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh boy!
Mr. Rinsler::: To the office!
Lincoln::: Whoa!
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, would you look at this, son?  Here's your Gramps and me on our first camp treasure hunt.
Lincoln:::  Treasure hunt?
Mr. Rinsler:::  Yep.  For the treasure of Captain Kit. You ever heard of the Great Lakes Storm of 1913?
Mr. Rinsler::: It was a monstrous blizzard that hit the very spot we're standing on.
Lynn Sr.::: Settin' the mood.
Mr. Rinsler::: That's Captain Kit.
Mr. Rinsler::: He was en route home after making a huge radish trade when he got caught in the storm.
Mr. Rinsler::: He had to abandon ship.  Legend has it he took all the gold he'd earned with him and buried it somewhere around him... 
Lincoln::: Whoa...  Did anyone ever find it? 
Mr. Rinsler:::  No.
Mr. Rinsler::: Who knows if it was even real? I just send campers out on the treasure hunt as a fun activity.  I have, however, been told that this hunk of wood is from the good captain's ship.
Mr. Rinsler::: Oh, geez... H...hang tight, camper. I'll go get some ice.
Lincoln::: Huh? 
Lynn Sr.::: Whatcha got there, kiddo?
Lincoln::: I think it's a map.
Lynn Sr.::: Wait.  If this map was hidden in the piece of wood from the captain's ship...
Lincoln::: And here's Camp Mastodon!
Lynn Sr.::: It must be...
Lincoln and Lynn Sr.::: Captain Kit's treasure map!
Lincoln::: Which means the treasure really IS somewhere around here!
Lynn Sr.:::  Son, if we can find that treasure, we can give it to Mr. Rinsler and save the camp!  You up for a little adventure?
Lincoln::: Heck yes, I am! 
Lynn Sr.:::  I'm gonna need that ice now...
Lori:::  This is the life, huh? This place is literally amazing.  Ugh, I just wish there was better service.
Leni:::  I think the service is just fine.
Lynn:::  Cann-Lynn ball! Woo!
Lola::: Lana, you'd better not be filling my sand castle with hermit crabs!
Luan::: Let's pick it up, Lunes! Everyone's got a leg up on us.
Lisa::: This is not my optimal idea of resting. Or peace.
Lincoln::: Guys, guys! Dad and I found a...  ...a treasure map!  It leads to gold~!
Lola::: Gold IS my signature color!
Leni::: Totes!
Lincoln::: No, no, no! If we can find it, we can help Dad save the camp.
Lola::: Alright, Linky!
Leni:::  Totes!
Flip::: If I didn't know any better, I'd say that sounds like Captain Kit's lost treasure!  Eh, Flip's gotta get some of that!
Lisa::: Hmm...
Lincoln::: Captain Kit marked the starting point with an X, which is where we're all standing!
Lola::: Where do we go from here?
Lincoln:::  Begin your journey with a starting clue, let this animal be a guide to you. Does anyone see any animals?
Lana::: Found some! 
Lynn Sr.:::  Lana, put... the hornet's nest... down!
Lana::: Uh-oh...
Luan:::  Hey, Linc, look! I don't think the clue's an animal.  It's a pun! It's a navi-gator! Get it?
Luna:::  Look, there's another one over here!
Luan:::  I found another one!
Lincoln::: They're trail markers!
Lynn Sr.::: I'll bet if we follow them...
Lincoln and Lynn Sr.::: They'll lead us to the treasure!
Lincoln::: Captain Kit, here we come!
Lincoln::: Uh, it doesn't look like there's a way around it.
Lynn::: I say we climb it. A little thigh chafing never hurt anyone.
Lynn Sr.::: I have very sensitive thighs.
Lori::: That is not happening. Why does everything rarely have to be an argument?...  
Lincoln::: Lily, you're a genius!
Lisa::: This ACTUAL genius begs to differ.
Lori:::  Ugh. Crawling through the dirt is literally so gross.
Rita::: That's just tree sap, honey. Nothing to worry about.  There, there. 
Lynn Sr.::: What's the next clue, son?
Lincoln::: Hmm. This is weird. It says, Butts will lead you to your mark, where you'll head into the dark. Butts?
Lynn::: WHOO!!! This is my kind of par-tay! 
Lisa:::  If I may. Not butts, buttes. The geomorphological term for isolated rock hills with steep slides.  That's a butte.
Lynn Sr.::: Ugh. How in the ding-dang world are we supposed to climb up that thing?!
Lynn Sr.:::  LJ, what's so heavy back there?!
Lynn::: We got some dead weight at the end, Pops.
Lori:::  Ooh, got service! Ugh, lost it. Ooh, got service! Ugh, lost it.
Lynn Sr.::: I AM THE STRONGEST MAN ALIVE! 
Lori::: Um, I hate to rain on your victory parade, Dad, but we're being followed.
Lincoln::: Maybe it's the ghost of Captain Kit.
Lisa::: Mm... negative. It's Flip; I saw him lurking in the lake while we were discussing the treasure.
Lynn Sr.::: He must be after the gold. Let's pick up the pace!  What's next, son?
Lincoln::: The clue said we are supposed to 'head into the dark.'
Lucy:::  HEAD... into the dark.
Lincoln:::  Whoa...
Lucy:::  Ha-ha. Because it's a skull. Get it?
Rita::: Okay, everyone. Let's stick together-- and don't touch anything.
Lynn Sr.::: Ha-ha! There we go; let's see now.
Leni:::  OMGosh!
Lynn Sr.::: Leni, what are you doing?!
Leni::: That necklace is SO vintage.  Eugh! I'll trade him my sunglasses to hide those dark circles! 
Leni::: Oh, no, he hates them! Is he more of an aviator guy?  Huh?
Lynn Sr.::: You did good, Leni!  Tie up the rope, Lana.
Lana::: Good to go! 
Lynn::: Hey, check this out!  STINKIN'!... 
Lincoln::: Listen closely and you shall hear, a sea song ringing in your ear.
Lola::: Maybe we're supposed to do something with that weird guitar.
Luna::: Whoa...
Lincoln::: It's Captain Kit's! Luna, can you play a sea song on it?
Luna::: Okay, but, uh...  I only know one, so I hope it works.
Luna::: Hmm, that jam usually slays. Let me see the map.  Oh, now I get it. SEA song!
Leni:::  Ooh, like, with your eyes? I don't see songs anywhere.
Luna::: No, silly. The letter C! I was playing in the wrong key.
Louds but Luna::: Whoa...
Luna::: Huh?  Whoa...
Lincoln::: Whoa...
Lincoln and Lynn Sr.::: We did it! We found Captain Kit's treasure!!
Lincoln::: We found the treasure!
All Louds::: Yay!
Lynn Sr.::: We can save Camp Mastodon!
Lana::: Ya hear that, Flip? You can stop followin' us now!
Lynn:::  Gold fight!
Rita::: Lynn, stop throwing priceless treasure at your siblings.
Lola::: Hmm, priceless?  More like WORTHless. This stuff is bogus!
Lynn Sr.::: What?! But it's so bright and shiny! And I'm so tired... 
Luan::: So if this isn't the treasure, then what is it?
Rita::: I don't know, but for now, everybody stop-- touching things!
Lana::: Whoa!!
Lily:::  Pwetty.  Uh-oh...
Lynn::: IT'S A TRAP!! RUNNNNNNN!!!
Lincoln:::  I think we're safe now.
Luna::: And also lost, bro...!
Luan::: We really brought the house down.  Get it...? 
Lynn::: Relax, that was just my stomach.  Hey, wait up! 
Lana::: Check it out - animal tracks! 
Lori::: Hey!
Lana::: Maybe they'll lead us outta here!
Lana::: Whoa - a wolverine!
Lana::: You guys... Don't be afraid; it's just trying to protect its babies!
Rita::: Oh, yeah?! Well, SO AM I!!
Rita::: Oh, yeah, that's right. Don't mess with Mama Loud!! You want some more of this?! I could do this all day!!  Why are you guys all still standing here?! LET'S ROLL OUT!!!
Lynn Sr.::: I haven't seen your mom this intense since I forgot our anniversary...
Lori::: Oof! 
Lucy::: It's a dead end.  The best kind of end. 
Lynn Sr.::: That's it - we're stuck. We're tunnel people now... Let's just start building our new forever home.  Here's the kitchen. And here's the den. And this'll be my man cave. Oh, who are you kidding Lynn?! The whole ding-dang thing's a cave!
Lincoln::: Huh...?  Look, it's Captain Kit's hat! I saw it in Mr. Rinsler's book!
Luan::: Don't worry, Dad. We'll find a way out of here...  ...and hat's no lie.
Lynn::: Oh, my butt... I think I added a crack.
Lana::: Anyone have any idea where we are?
Leni::: Ooh, I know. A dark scary place.
Lincoln::: Hey, check this out.
Lincoln::: It's the same symbol that's on the map.  Hmm...
Luna:::  Dude, the top part looks like your necklace. 
Leni::: Careful! The bone man gave me that!
Lisa::: I think the word you're looking for is, uh, skeleton.
Lucy::: And a fine specimen it was.
Lori::: What's that bottom part of the symbol? It looks like a gemstone.
Lola::: Yeah, but we haven't seen any gems since the fake treasure room! And those are long gone.
Lily::: Tada!
Rita::: I know Mommy said no touching, but good girl.
Lincoln::: Let me see both pieces.  Here goes nothing...
Leni::: Are we allowed to celebrate?
Lola::: Hm, proper weight... good luster...  It's real, all right.
Lana::: Let's get this party STARTED!!!
Lynn:::  Everybody load up!
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh... no.
Lincoln::: Heh-heh, I'm sure that's nothing...
Lori::: Why does every wall in this place move?!
Lincoln::: We're gonna drop!!
Lynn::: Good thing I never skip Leg Day!  You guys are... egh... heavier... than I... thought...! 
Lynn Sr.::: It's not us! All this gold is weighing us down! Everyone, drop your packs!
Lincoln::: Dad, what about the camp?
Lynn Sr.::: What?! You guys are way more important to me than any treasure!
Lynn::: Listen to the man! 
Lynn Sr.::: Lola, you too.
Lola:::  Ugh, okay...
Lola::: Seriously?! Did we just give our treasure to FLIP?!
Rita:::  That's not Flip. That's...
Leonard::: Hang on, little minnows!
Louds::: Gramps?!
Leonard::: Ha-ha, I got you!
Leonard::: Welcome aboard, kiddos! Got your Morse code message. It said, 'Dud, camp Mustard close.' 
Lynn Sr.::: Oh yeah, I never was fluent in Morse. Oh, it's so good to see you, Dad. 
Leonard:::  Great to see you too, Lynnie. Now, uh... if you could just ease up on the grip, I'll get us back to camp. 
Mr. Rinsler::: Oh, hey there, Louds. I was about to see how many marshmallows I can fit into my mouth! Watch!  Thirty-two. 
Lynn Sr.::: We have amazing news!
Leonard::: You're not gonna believe this!
Mr. Rinsler:::  Is that you, Leonard Loud? You're hairier than I remember. 
Leonard::: And you're older than I remember. 
Lynn Sr.::: We found Captain Kit's treasure! There were moving walls, and holes in the floor! And we rode a slide, and there was a wolverine and a bone man!
Lincoln::: The point is...  Now you can save the camp.
Mr. Rinsler:::  Wow, that sure is a lot of gold. Thanks!
Mr. Rinsler::: But, uh, no thanks.
Lynn Sr.::: I'm sorry, what now?
Mr. Rinsler::: Well, as great as they were, I'm afraid my Mastodon days are over.
Lynn::: Buddy, I dangled off a CLIFF for that gold!
Mr. Rinsler::: Well, gosh. That sounds exciting, but I'm out of here next week. I bought a condo in Florida.
Louds::: Florida?!
Mr. Rinsler::: Yep. The whole state is one giant summer camp for retirees.
Lynn Sr.::: That's it? There--there's no more camp?
Lori::: Sorry, Dad...
Lynn Sr.:::  I'll be okay. If this is my last time at Mastodon, it's fine, 'cause you guys gave me the best memory I'll ever have of this place.
Leonard::: Hmm, uh, a crazy thought, but, uh, what if it didn't have to be the last time?
Lisa::: Of course! I'll rip a hole in the space-time continuum, construct a time machine out of Gramps' boat, and send us back 30 years to enjoy Camp Mastodon in days of yore.
Leonard::: I was thinking maybe I'd just take over the camp.
Lisa:::  Oh, sure. If you want to do it the easy way.
Lynn Sr.::: Wait, wh--what are you talking about, Dad? You've been a fisherman your whole life. I thought you loved it.
Leonard::: I do, but, uh, I think it's time for this salty dog to, uh, to drop anchor. I've always loved Mastodon. Plus, I'd get to spend more time with the family I've been missing all these years...
Luna::: Yeah, those dudes are most definitely related.
Mr. Rinsler:::  Well, this is perfect. It would be my honor to turn the camp over to you, Leonard.
Leonard::: And it would be my honor to carry on your legacy, Rinsler. But I am gonna need that treasure.
Lola:::  Fine! 
Leonard and Lynn Sr.::: Yeah, heh-heh-heh, mm-mm-mm, ooh!
Lincoln::: Thanks, Captain Kit.
Flip:::  Aw, dang it. How did you chiefs get past the wolverine?
Louds::: Ooh. Ouch. Ooh...
Lynn Sr.::: Look at us running the ol' three-legged race again...
Leonard::: Yep, and it's even better with fifteen legs! Right, my little minnows?
Leonard and Lynn Sr.::: Oof! 
Leonard::: Poison ivy?
Lynn Sr.:::  It itches just like I remember...
Lynn Sr.::: I love you so much, Dad!
Leonard::: I love you so much, Lynn!
Lynn:::  Yup, definitely related.
