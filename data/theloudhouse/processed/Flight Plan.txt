Carlos::: Okay, mi amore, open.  Happy anniversary, Frida.
Frida:::  Carlos, you made a portrait of me out of breakfast?
Carlos::: Oh well, the kids helped too.
Frida::: I love it so much.  How beautiful mis amores, and delicious. Thank you, Carlos. And here's your gift.
Carlos::: You got me a trip to fly on a vintage World War II aircraft?  On the P-40 Warhawk, no less.
CJ::: That's a great gift.
Carl::: So when are we going?
Frida::: I'm sorry but the ride is only for your father and me.
Carl & CJ::: What?
Carl::: Then what are we gonna do all day?
Frida::: Mr. Nakamura, thank you so much for watching the boys on such short notice. The whole family was busy today so we really appreciate it.
Mr. Nakamura::: It's our pleasure. Isn't it Nelson?
Frida::: Be good for Mr. Nakamura, boys.
Carlos:::  P-40 Warhawk, here I come!
Carl::: Yeah I know bro, I wanted to go on that plane too. But we're stuck with Mr. Nakamura and Nelson.  You little genius, that's a great idea. We'll drive Mr. Nakamura away and Mom and Dad will have to take us on the plane.
Mr. Nakamura::: Oh boys look what I brought, my collection of antique toys. Aren't they magnificent? Nelson brought some of his, too.  No, no no. These are for you to look at, not to play with, they are more valuable inside the box.
Carl::: I think I know how to get rid of this guy.  Mr. Nakamura, can you please make us some popcorn?
Mr. Nakamura::: Oh, sure. My favorite vintage snack.
Carl:::  It's play time.
Mr. Nakamura::: Popcorn's ready.  For the love of all things antique!
Carl::: Is this one of those stretchy toys?  Whoopsie.
Stanley::: Happy anniversary! I heard you're gonna see some rickety old airplane. Boring! Trains are so much cooler.
Frida::: Hi Mr. Nakamura. What? Toy-pacalypse?  Aye, sorry Mr. Chang, you better go on without us.  We need a new babysitter.
Stanley::: I bet trains could babysit better than airplanes.  Not again.
Frida::: Thank you so much for coming last minute Miranda.
Miranda::: Oh, it's no trouble at all. We're gonna have fun watching a movie, as long as it's not a scary movie I just can't handle those.
Rom-Com Actor::: Why can't you see that I love you, silly girl?
Miranda::: Gosh, I love this movie.  What was that?
Carl::: Oh no! Not again! I'm changing!
Miranda::: Aah! Werewolf!
CJ:::  Here's… CJ!
Carl:::  P-40 Warhawk, here we come.
Stanley::: ..and reason number seventy-eight why trains are better than planes.
Everyone else on the train::: Enough already.
Carlos & Frida::: Phew.
Frida::: Oh no, what now? Hi Miranda. What? Monsters? I know they can get rowdy but… Yes I understand.
Carlos::: She quit, didn't she?
Frida:::  That's it! It's time for some serious sitting.
Maybelle::: So you're the terrible three this whole building's been talking about. You're thinking about how to get rid of me right now.
CJ::: Us? Of course not.
Carl::: Miss Maybelle, could you please make us some popcorn?
Maybelle::: No!
CJ::: The old popcorn trick failed. What are we gonna do?
Maybelle::: Less talking, more scrubbing.  Oh, Javier Luna, you hunk you.  Maybelle here?
Carl:::  Hola, this is Javier Luna.
Maybelle::: Javier Luna?
Carl::: May-bey, I want to cook you dinner at my mansion. I'll be serving mango chicken, mango al-gratte, and mango soufflé
Maybelle:::  I'll be right there! My sweet mango.
Carlos::: Holy Wright brothers, it's beautiful.  Don't answer it.
Frida::: It could be an emergency.  Hey Maybelle. What? A hot date with a movie star? Maybelle? And she hung up.
Carlos::: Ah, I told you not to answer. 
Carl::: Operation: Sitter be-gone was a success, and it's a beautiful day for flying.
CJ::: Uh, Mom, the plane's are that way.
Frida::: Oh, you're not here for the planes.
Carl & CJ::: What?
Frida::: The only reason you're here is because no one else will watch you. So while we enjoy our flight, you three can sit on that bench and think about what you've done.
Carl::: Ah, I hate thinking about what I've done. Can we put the bench on the plane?  All that work for nothing. Well, I'm sorry, but we have come too far. I'm getting on that plane.
CJ::: This doesn't look like the old plane. Where's Mom and Dad?
Plane Computer::: Welcome to AI Airlines. The world's first self-flying airplane.
CJ::: We got on the wrong plane.
Plane Computer::: Please take a seat and prepare for takeoff. Your final destination... the arctic.
Carl::: The arctic? But I have school tomorrow. And for once I did my homework!
Plane Computer::: Taking off, in five… four…  three…  two… one… blast off!
CJ::: We gotta get off this thing!
Carl::: Maybe one of these buttons will make us land.
Plane Computer::: Activating zero gravity mode.
CJ::: I think we can fly.
Carl::: Aw man, this is better than an old dumb plane.
Plane Computer::: Charming, thank you, Carl.
Carl:::  It knows my name.  What else can you do?
Plane Computer::: Ending zero gravity mode.  Boys, may suggest taking your seats?  And you may need these.
Carl::: What do we need barf bags for?
Plane Computer::: Entering stunt plane mode.
Carl::: Okay, that's enough of that.  There's gotta be a landing mode on this dumb smart plane.
Plane Computer::: Economy mode.
Carl:::  I just wanna land.
Plane Computer:::  Hey! You want to land the plane so bad? Do it yourself. Entering manual mode.
CJ::: Uh, what does she mean by... land the plane yourself?
Carl::: Come on! We gotta fix this.  Do any of you guys know how to work this thing?  I know you're just a baby. We're all babies.  I want my mommy!
CJ::: We're sorry computer lady, please help us!
Plane Computer:::  I'm waiting for Carl's apology.
Carl::: I'm really sorry for pushing your buttons. Please land the plane for us.
Plane Computer::: Hmm, you're lucky I like children. Back to your seats boys. I've got this.  Landing in three… two… one…  Touchdown complete.  Oh and Carl, I'll be watching you.
Carl::: Oh! You beautiful bench!
CJ::: We're alive!
Carl::: Look! It's Mom and Dad!  Oh, Mom, we are so sorry for being difficult today and scaring away every babysitter.
CJ::: We promise to be good next time.
Carl::: We clearly need supervision.
Carlos:::  What is happening?
Frida:::  I don't know but I like it.  We forgive you mis amores, now come on we should head to the train to get home.
Carlos::: No need, I took the liberty of calling up one of those cool new self-driving cabs. And look here it is now.
Plane Computer::: Hello, Carl.
