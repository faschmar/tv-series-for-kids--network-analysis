Lincoln:::  I can't wait to see this episode!
Announcer::: Last time on Kitchen Ambush, Chef Guy Grazer turned up the heat.
Guy::: Miserable!  Your dish lacks taste, just like your tacky apron!
Announcer::: Who will Guy ambush tonight? Tune into find out.
Mr. Coconuts::: Yeesh! I'd hate to be in her shoes. He shredded her like a block of cheddar!
Todd::: HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON, SWEETIES. DON'T FORGET TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK.  I'LL BE CHECKING. 
Lisa::: Note to self: Dial back Todd's maternal mode.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, good, you're here! Before you jump into homework, I need your help with the afternoon rush.
Lincoln::: No problem. Guys, fan out!
Lola::: Here you are, ladies!
Meryl::: Ooh! Nothing like a plate of hot buns!
Lana::: So that is two hockey pucks, side of dough, well done, with axel grease.
Mr. Grouse::: I ordered sausage patties and toast with butter.
Lana::: Yeah, that's what I just said.
Grant::: Your total comes out to... carry the nine, subtract by seven, divide-
Lisa::: $43.17. Plus a 20% gratuity of $8.63.
Lynn Sr.::: Woohoo! We did it! Oh, you kids are a big help, especially with Mom off visiting Lori for Mother-Daughter Golf Day!
Random Student::: Ow!
Lynn Sr.:::  Lynn's Table, come in if you're able. You've got Lynn.
Kotaro::: Lynn, I have some exciting news! The Doo Dads just booked a big gig tonight at Sunset Canyon!
Lynn Sr.:::  No. We. Dadn't!
Kotaro::: Yes we dad! It's Bernie's third wedding! He's marrying his lady friend from Boca!
Lynn Sr.:::  Ohhh! Ding dang darn it! I have to work the dinner shift. I gave Grant the night off to play Orcs, Horks, Wizards and Pork with his friends.
Grant:::  Many thanks, Spirit Wizard Loud! May your harvest be fruitful this moon! 
Lynn Sr.:::  You guys should just do the gig without this Doo Dad.
Kotaro::: But a band with just one cowbell is no band at all.
Lincoln::: Hey, Dad, what if we took over the restaurant tonight?
Lynn Sr.::: Aw, that's sweet of you guys, but a night alone's a big responsibility.
Lola:::  We know this place like the back of our flawless hands.  Ew! Time for a mani.
Kotaro::: Come on, Lynn. They can do it.
Lynn Sr.::: Huh. Well, OK. But if there's an emergency, you give me a call. And when in doubt, use my cookbook.  Every recipe I've ever made is in that thing.
Luan:::  Ooh! You won't rag-ret this!
Lisa::: Uh, Luan, that's Father's sweat rag.
Luan::: Ugh! 
Lynn Sr.::: Thanks, kids! Kotaro, polish up our wedding cowbells! We've got a reception buffet to rock!
Luan::: Order up!  Way up!
Scoots::: You expect me to eat these without-
Lisa::: Maple syrup?  Your total comes out to $8. Not including tip, of course.
Scoots::: Here's a tip: Pack an umbrella tomorrow. It's gonna rain.
Lana::: That was the last customer. What was Dad so worried about, anyway?
Lynn::: Yeah, we crushed it.  Oh-oh?
Lucy::: It's Guy Grazer.
Guy::: That's right! I've heard a lot about this place and wanted to feature it on Kitchen Ambush.
Lola::: Now?!
Guy::: It's called Kitchen Ambush, not Kitchen Whenever It's Convenient For You!
Lincoln::: Um, would you give us a moment?
Luan::: Uh, what do we do? Should we call Dad?
Lincoln::: No. He's playing his gig. Let him enjoy Bernie's wedding. Besides, we can totally handle Guy.  We're in!
Guy::: Good, because my appetizer should have been here FIVE FLAMBÉ-IN' MINUTES AGO!  Lynn-ger chicken? Lynn-sagna? Balsamic Lynn-egar? Ugh, puns. The dry toast of the cooking world.
Lana::: Coming through!
Luan::: OK, uh, gotta get some apps ready. Paprika, garlic powder. Does anyone have the thyme?
Leni::: It's 7:30.
Mr. Coconuts::: You walked right into that one, toots.
Lucy:::  I brought Guy a plate of jalapeño poppers and bread to start.
Lisa::: You did? But I just brought over jalapeño poppers and bread.
Lana:::  No need to worry, everyone. I brought Guy some jalapeño poppers and bread to tide him over.
Lincoln::: Lucy, can you go take Guy's order?
Guy:::  What will I have? Bring me one of everything! And how about some more bread? I don't think there's enough for the entire state of Michigan!
Luan::: OK, let's not panic. We can still turn this around with Dad's great food. Now where's his cookbook?
Leni::: Got it right here.  What? He said when in doubt, use his cookbook.
Luan::: Oh, Leni.  I can still make out some of his ca-Lynn-mari recipe, and his New Eng=Lynn clam chowder one.
Lincoln::: It'll have to do! Let's just get cooking.
Guy::: More children?! Is this a restaurant or a preschool?! Are there any adults in here?
Lana::: Actually, this is our dad's place. We're just helping out tonight.
Guy::: Well, that explains everything! Alright, off with you.
Lucy::: Bye.
Guy::: Hmm. Right. I think we have enough footage for tonight's show.
Lynn::: Welp, this bites. If that episode airs, Dad's restaurant is crushed.
