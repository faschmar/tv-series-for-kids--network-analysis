Comedy Lounge Manager:::  Thanks for coming out to Chuckle Condo. Lansing's fourth favorite comedy club.  I'm sorry, but tonight's headliner comedian has just cancelled.
Joannie:::  Maybe, the comedian had so much on his plate.  Or maybe it's pasta their bedtime.
Comedy Lounge Manager::: Hey Joannie, why don't you come up on stage and perform? You're already a hit with the audience.
Joannie::: Okay, knock knock-
Mr. Coconuts::: Hey, Toots, let's wrap it up.  If you wanna turn that play in on time, you better get to school.
Luan::: Just making some last minute changes to the scene.  And... Done.
Benny::: Hey Luan.
Luan::: Hey, what's up Benny?
Benny::: I just wanted to say, good luck. I hope you win the playwriting contest.
Luan::: Oh, thanks.  Knock on wood.
Mr. Coconuts::: Hey, quit it, Toots. You're giving me a splintering headache.
Benny:::  More like a mi-grain.
Mrs. Bernardo:::  Introducing... the woman who recently played the coveted role of Confused Eater in the new Burpin' Burger commercial...  Mrs. Bernardo!
Benny:::  Wow, Mrs. B has really stepped up her entrance game.
Mrs. Bernardo:::  Thank you. Thank you. Oh. No, please. Hold your applause.  As you know, the winner of the playwriting contest will be directing the play they wrote. There were a number of superb entries, but only one dazzled me. And the winner is... 
Lyberti::: Oh my goodness...
Rex:::  Ah...
Spencer::: Oh....
Amy::: I got this...
Mrs. Bernardo::: ..Luan Loud!
Luan:::  Really?
Mrs. Bernardo:::  Really, really. And you'll be needing this.  Every director must have one.
Benny::: Congrats Luan.
Luan::: Thanks for the opportunity Mrs. B. I can't wait to get started.  Woah.
Luan::: Alright everyone.  Welcome to our first rehearsal. My play, Don't Sassafras Me: The Life and Times of Joannie Sassafras, is about my comedy hero, who took a chance to pursue her dream.  I've written the roles you'll be playing on each of your scripts.
Shannon::: Wow! I play Joannie?
Benny::: Owner of the Chuckle Condo? That's a lot of responsibility Luan.
Spencer::: Woah, Announcer Guy, and Clown Judge Number Three? Nice!
Luan:::  Okay, let's get started with scene one. This is where young Joannie puts on her first show for her kindergarten class. Everyone, take your places.  And... Action!
Shannon::: Who's ready for a show?  What's that? I can't ear you.
Luan::: Cut! Cut! Cut! Rex, what are you doing?
Rex::: I workshopped my character and decided that he laughs like this because he has a deviated symptom, it makes his laugh weird, but in act two we discover that...
Luan::: No, no, no, no. I mean, you're not even in this scene.
Amy:::  Oh, I added him. Cause we didn't have any scenes together and out onstage chemistry is undeniable.
Luan::: Amy, you're not in this scene either.
Amy::: Our chemistry needs context.
Luan::: I don't know if...  Well, I guess you can stay. Let's move on.
Luan::: Okay, this scene is where Joannie auditions to get into clown college. this is a really big moment in her life.  And... Action.
Shannon:::  Aye, Governor. why did the banana go to the doctor? It wasn't peeling well.
Luan::: Cut.  Shannon, what's with the accent? Joannie's American.
Shannon::: I'm adding some sophistication to my character. Ever heard of William Shakespeare? He made all of his actors speak in a British accent.
Luan::: Well, okay fine. Just not too Cockney.
Luan::: In this scene... Joannie leaves her family and heads to the big city with dreams of becoming a comedian.  And... Action.
Shannon:::  Well, I'm off to the big city with dreams of becoming a comedian.
Lyberti:::  Farewell! My young daughter! May all of your fondest wishes come true.
Luan::: Cut! Um, Lyberti, this isn't a musical.
Lyberti::: I know. But my mom sings to me every morning before I leave for school.
Luan::: Okay, fine. We'll make the singing work. Let's continue.
Shannon:::  Is this the bus to the city?
Amy::: It sure is. Here, let me get your bag for you.
Luan::: Amy, what are you doing? The script doesn't say tap dance.
Amy::: I'm just trying to spice up the scene by adding a little jazzy choreography. Rex and I have been taking a couple's tap class. Let's show them a little something, Rexy! Five, six, seven, eight.
Rex:::  Tap, tap.
Luan:::  Everyone! Let's take five.
Mr. Coconuts::: What's wrong? You look worse than I did when I had a case of the termites last month.
Luan::: Oh. My friend's are making so many changes to my play, it doesn't feel like the same one I wrote.
Lyberti::: Eek! Amy and Rex fell in the orchestra pit!
Amy::: We're okay. Luckily we're also taking a couple's stunt class.
Rex::: Our characters should totally have a karate battle during Joannie's clown college graduation.
Amy::: Yeah!
Luan::: I can't take it anymore. This production is out of control.
Mr. Coconuts::: You're the director. Just tell your theatre pals to zip it, shut their traps, quit flapping their gums, put a kibosh on it.
Luan::: Oh, I can't. I don't want my friends to get mad at me.
Mr. Coconuts::: Sorry, doll. I can't relate. I got no problem speaking my mind and laying down the law.
Luan::: Yeah, believe me. I know.  Hmmm... 
Actors::: Huh?
Mr. Coconuts:::  Listen up, folks! I'm the director now. There's gonna be some new rules around here. Rule number one... Stick to the script!
Shannon::: Wait, I'm confused. Isn't that just Luan holding a puppet?
Lyberti::: Honestly, I don't even know anymore.
Spencer::: I'm not taking direction from a piece of wood.
Mr. Coconuts:::  The only thing wooden around here is your acting. Any more shenanigans from you, and you'll never work in high school theatre again! Now, places, everybody! Take it from the top of scene ten!
Benny::: Introducing the Princess of Puns, the First Lady of Funny, the Shining Star of Saginaw, please welcome... Joannie Sassafras!
Mr. Coconuts::: Cut, cut, cut! Where's Joannie's rolly-skates? These are part of her signature look!
Shannon::: I thought Joannie needed a bigger entrance.
Mr. Coconuts::: Oh, you thought. But your job is to read the script the way it's written. Now give me twenty laps, toots!  You call that hustle?! I've seen molasses move faster than that!
Spencer:::  Hey, Mr. C.  What do you think? I wore this in last year's production of A Meat-Cart Named Desire.  RELIIIIIISH! RELIIIIIISH!  Uh, I think I need a little help!
Mr. Coconuts::: CUT! What's the big idea here?!
Lyberti::: I figured, sure, I could just walk into scene. But isn't this more fun?
Mr. Coconuts:::  Anybody else have a problem with walking?
Lyberti:::  Mmm, custard.
Rex::: Heh?
Mr. Coconuts:::  Get on now! Get!  Anyone else have any changes they'd like to make to Luan's play?  I didn't think so.
Mr. Coconuts::: I'll see you all tomorrow for opening night. And don't even think about showing up late.
Luan::: Wow, Mr. Coconuts that was amazing. I could never speak up to my friends the way you have. Thanks to you, my play actually looks like the one I wrote.
Mr. Coconuts::: Awe. You're welcome. Now give me twenty laps!
Luan::: Huh?
Mr. Coconuts::: Ah. Sorry Toots, I'm just all wound up.
Luan::: Hey!
Benny::: Hey, Luan!
Luan::: Wha...?  Benny, where is everyone? The curtain goes up in an hour.
Benny::: I don't know how to tell you this, but everyone quit your play.
Luan::: What? Why?
Benny::: They couldn't deal with Mr. Coconuts.
Luan:::  But, it's opening night. What am I gonna do?
Mrs. Bernardo:::  You're going to fix this mess.  Which is also the name of my new one woman show! Premiering this Saturday in the common room of my condominium.  Make sure you get their early, my neighbors are planning a barbecue that evening.  Luan, walk with me, fellow thespian.  I chose your play because it's about a woman who stood up and let her voice be heard. If you want to honor Joannie by putting on your play tonight, you need to let your voice be heard. Not this.  Now go. Find your actors, and  let them hear what Luan has to say.
Luan::: I will. Thanks Mrs. Bernardo.  Oh, sorry Mr. Coconuts.
Mr. Coconuts::: Give a guy a little warning next time, Toots.
Luan::: Hey guys. Listen, I should have never put Mr. Coconuts in charge. It's just that, this play means a lot to me, and when you were all changing it, it wasn't mine anymore. I should've just spoken up. I'm sorry.
Shannon::: It's okay. We shouldn't have messed with your play Luan. We're sorry.
Luan:::  Awe, bring it in, Drama Club.
Mr. Coconuts::: Awe, I'm sorry too. I want in on this cuddle puddle.
Luan::: So, is there any chance you guys would wanna come back and do the play tonight?
Shannon:::  Okay guys, one more joke and then I gotta roll. You're wheely gonna like this one. What time does a duck wake up in the morning?  At the quack of dawn.  Thank you and good night.  Let's hear it for our director... Luan Loud.
Luan::: I couldn't have done this without Mrs. Bernardo. Come take a bow too, Mrs. B.
Mrs. Bernardo:::  Thank you! Thank you everyone!  I'm okay.
Mr. Coconuts::: And that's a wrap, people.
