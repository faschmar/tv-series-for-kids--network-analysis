Sergio:::  That's a wrap, people! 
Carlos::: Impressive new camera, Sergio. 
Sergio:::  Check out the zoom. 
Ronnie Anne::: That's a lot of nose hair. 
CJ::: It's like a jungle in there. 
Rosa:::  Mino, it's finally happening! My favorite astrologer, Ernesto Estrella is coming to visit me!  I mean, Great Lake City, where I live!   He's promoting his new book! I have so many things for him to sign!  The Ernesto Estrella crystal ball!  The Ernesto Estrella Bathroom Scale! 
Ernesto::: You're perfect! 
Rosa:::  The Ernesto Estrella plush doll! 
Ernesto::: Es tu destino! 
Rosa::: I have to camp out at the bookstore so I am first in line to meet him!  
Hector:::  That's ridiculous. I wouldn't camp out for anything! 
Hector::: Hmm...  Let's go see the bobo!
Ronnie Anne::: Wow, lots of people are here to see Ernesto Estrella! 
Rosa:::  And I am going to see him first! 
Carl::: Get your front spot here! $100 for cutsies! 
Teenager::: I don't want your spot, but how much for the taco? 
Carl::: How about 5 bucks? 
Bobby::: Aww! 
Ronnie Anne::: Hey, Lincoln! What's up? 
Lincoln::: I finally did it, Ronnie Anne! I learned how to shape my gum into a race car. Check it out! 
Ronnie Anne:::  Yeah, Lincoln, looks just like a race car. Check this out. 
Lincoln::: Statue of Libergum? That's amazing! Hey, is that a tent behind you? Hope I'm not innterupting a family vacation thing. 
Hector::: Aye aye aye!  
Ronnie Anne::: More like my Abuela trying to see our favorite astrologer celebrity type thing. 
Lincoln::: Oh yeah, typical family outing. Well, I'm gonna go work on my gum tricks. See ya! 
Lincoln::: How did she do that? 
Messenger:::  May I have your attention please? I have an important message from Ernesto Estrella. 
Ernesto:::  Hola! It is I, Ernesto Estrella.  I am getting a strong sign that Great Lake City is extremely bad luck right now. I will return when the dark cloud has lifted. Until next time, cono mas es suerte.  
Audience::: Boooo! 
Messenger::: Okay guys, ow! I'm just the messenger! 
Ronnie Anne::: C'mon Abuela, let's get out of here. 
Hector::: Okay, the tent's done. Hello? Where is everyone? 
Carl::: Ugh, what a waste of time! Except for the tacos, of course. 
Carl::: Mmmm, El Pastor burps. 
Hector::: I always thought Ernesto Estrella was a bobo. 
Ronnie Anne::: No one would believe that an entire city could be bad luck. 
Rosa::: Mija, what are you doing up there? Get under the table where it's safe!
Ronnie Anne::: Abuela, we're not doing that.
Rosa::: Then I must sage the whole house! 
Rosa::: The only way to lift this curse is to use Ernesto Estrella's immortal words! 
Rosa::: Vete, vete, vete, Mala suerte, suerte, suerte. Bad luck, go away! Come again another day! 
Carl::: What flavor juice box do you want for the park? Red or purple. 
CJ::: Hmm, purple! 
Ernesto:::  Great Lake City is bad luck, Rosa. Keep your babies safe. 
Ernesto::: Eh, I would have gone with a red.  
Rosa::: You must stay inside. You are forbidden from going to the park!
Rosa::: Vete, vete, vete, Mala suerte, suerte, suerte. 
Carlota::: Is that my aerobics hoop? 
Rosa::: It's a saging hoop now. 
Carlota::: Okay, cool. 
Bobby::: You ready to go to the mall, Carlota? 
Ernesto:::  The mall? They will be shopping for disaster!  
Rosa::: I cannot allow you to go to the mall.  It's too dangerous! 
Carlota::: Seriously?
Ronnie Anne::: Abuela, have you seen my skateboard? Gah! 
Rosa::: I'm sorry, mija, I'm just trying to protect you. 
Ronnie Anne::: Well, if you say so.  Ooh, there it is! Good thing I found it. I'm late to meet Casey and Sameer at the movies. 
Ernesto:::  The movies? That's 2 tickets to danger!  
Rosa::: No one in my precious familia is going out into this cursed city!  You heard Ernesto. There are too many bad spirits out there. 
Bobby:::  The door won't open! Open up! Let me in! 
Rosa::: Bobby? Mijo, I told you not to go outside! 
Sergio::: I got this. 
Carl::: Okay! Abuela's lost it!
Ronnie Anne::: I know, we have to prove the city's not cursed or we'll never leave the house again!  Sergio! Stop filming! 
Sergio:::  Compelling drama.
Bobby::: Abuela won't listen to us, she only listens to Ernesto Estrella.
Ronnie Anne::: Then we have to get him to change his mind about our city.
Carl::: How are we gonna do that?  Ow! Easy on the zoom bird!
Ronnie Anne::: Wait, that's it. We make a video showing Ernesto that GLC, not only stands for Great Lakes City, but also for Good Luck City.
Sergio:::  I'll direct, and probably win awards.  I'd like to thank my fans.  And my girlfriend, Priscilla. Love you, baby. We did it!  Back at cha.
CJ::: Snap out of it Sergio.
Carl:::  Yeah, we've got some filming to do.
Ronnie Anne::: First, we have to sneak out without Abuela seeing us.
Rosa::: Aye, I forgot to sage Lalo's fart pillow.
Ronnie Anne::: Now's our chance.  Go, go, go.
Sergio:::  Places everyone! City of good luck! Take one! And… Action!
Ronnie Anne::: I'm Ronnie Anne, proud citizen of Great Lakes City. Here I am enjoying some cotton candy.
Sergio::: Snooze fest! Not gonna win any awards.  Hey, cue the cotton candy.
Ronnie Anne:::  As you can see... no bad luck here.
Cotton Candy Vendor:::  Run for your lives! There's so much bad luck here!
Sergio::: Action!
Bobby::: I'm here at Great Lakes City's finest family run mercado.
Sergio:::  Cue the extras.  And I said nine marshmallows in my cocoa!
Bobby:::  A place where there's luck in every aisle. Ooh, two for one canned corn? My lucky day.  Ah! No! It's not my lucky day. Help me!
Carl::: Anyone who thinks this city's bad luck hasn't tried our delicious pizza.
Pizza Chef::: Aye! Mama Mia!
Sergio:::  Beautiful! That's a wrap people! Action! Suspense! Pizza! Movie has it all.
Ronnie Anne:::  Sergio! You did all this on purpose?! We're supposed to prove the city is safe.
Sergio:::  Safe doesn't win awards. See ya on the red carpet.
Bobby::: These are scratches from the feral cats. And this is freezer burn from being trapped with the ice cream. Oh, and these are bruises from the pizza explosion. And I don't know why there's a fish in my pants. 
Lori::: Awe, my Boo-Boo-Bear is full of boo boos. At least your adorable nose is still intact.
Carlota::: That was a total disaster.
Ronnie Anne::: We definitely can't ever show Ernesto or Abuela that video.
Rosa:::  Aye! Madre Mia! Sergio just showed me the video!
Ronnie Anne::: Sergio! Why?!
Sergio:::  Proud of my work.
Ronnie Anne::: Abuela, we can explain.
Ernesto::: No! I'll explain. The bad luck has only just begun Rosa. Get out while you still can!
Rosa::: Ernesto's right, we are no longer safe here! The Casagrandes must leave Great Lakes City, pronto!
Ronnie Anne::: Abuela, we can't just pack up and leave. Where would we even go? 
Rosa::: I'm sorry, mija, but we must leave ASAP.
Lori::: Bobby, I'm already home for the weekend. You guys should stay with my family. Then I could literally see your Boo-Boo Bear face in person. 
Bobby::: You hear that, abuela? Can we stay with the Louds? Please, please, please, please, please?
Rosa::: Really, Lori? Are you sure that's OK with your family?
Lori::: Oh, they'll be totally cool with it.
Rita and Lynn Sr.::: We are totally not cool with it.
Lori::: Come on, guys. They need our help.
Lynn Sr.::: Kiddo, we'd never turn our backs on the Casagrandes, but-
Rita::: There's so many of us, and so many of them, and so many of us! Maybe it would be best if we called them and-
Lincoln::: They're here, they're here, they're here! 
Rita::: Of course they are.
Ronnie Anne:::  Hey, Linc!
Casagrandes::: Hola, familia Loud!
Rita::: Rosa, Lori tells us you're in an interesting... predicament.
Rosa::: Yes. My astrologer Ernesto Estrella proclaimed our entire city to be cursed!
Lisa::: For the love of Einstein, everyone knows that luck is pure absurdity.
Lynn Sr.:::  Sweetie, they brought flan.
Luan::: Flan-tastic!
Lynn Sr.::: Hah, good one! I'm a flan of your work! 
Lincoln:::  Check out this gum Eiffel Tower! 
Ronnie Anne:::  Oh, wow. You've gotten so much better, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: I've been practicing.
Rosa::: I hope we're not putting you out.
Rita:::  Of course not! We totally have space for twelve extra people!
CJ::: Woo-hoo!
Lola:::  Just don't touch my stuff.
Carl::: Oh, I'm gonna touch it all. 
Lynn Sr.:::  Who's ready to eat?
Ronnie Anne::: I've missed your dad's tuna casserole!
Lincoln::: Not as much as I've missed your abuela's tamales!
Ronnie Anne::: Guess we also missed dinner.
Ronnie Anne::: Gotta go! Gotta go!
Luna:::  Knock, knock, knocking on the bathroom door.  I gotta go.
Lori::: No, Boo-Boo Bear. You go first.
Bobby::: Oh, Babe! I'd never go before you! You're my number one.
Lori::: No, you're my number one.
Lana::: Well, I gotta go number two.
Lynn::: Lynn Loud with a steal! Ooh, ooh!  Wait a second, I need that. 
CJ::: See? Who needs the bathroom?
Ronnie Anne::: Yeah. We have the sink all to ourselves.
CJ::: I'm brushing here.
Lola::: My princess toothbrush! How dare you?! 
Ronnie Anne::: Well, on the bright side, we don't have to sleep on the floor.
Ronnie Anne::: On second thought, I'd rather sleep on the floor.
Frida::: At least you're not in a coffin!
Lucy::: Good night. May you all sleep like the dead.
Carl:::  Ugh! I want to go back home.
Carlos::: I think it's kind of fun. We can pretend to be the mummies of ancient pharaohs.
Frida:::  You're not helping! 
Carlota::: Stop drooling on me! 
Maria::: Hey!
Carlota::: Ugh! Are you kidding me?!
Sergio:::  Need a snuggle.
Ronnie Anne::: Guys, it's been a long day. Let's just try to get some sleep.
Bobby::: There's something in the coffin with me!
Ronnie Anne::: Abuela, please. We can't stay here. It's too many people!
Rosa::: Mija, it might be hard, but at least we're not in Bad Luck City.
Ronnie Anne::: This is worse than bad luck.
Ronnie Anne::: Ugh! We gotta find a way to end this nightmare!
Carl::: I miss my choo-choo sheets.
Lola::: I miss you not being here.  Stop it!
Bobby::: I'm OK!
Lincoln::: Well, that was bad luck. Good thing your abuela didn't see that.
Lisa::: Logically speaking, you'd want her to see that. It proves that bad luck can happen anywhere.
Ronnie Anne::: Wait a minute. Lisa's right. If we can show Abuela that bad luck can happen here too, maybe she'll let us go home.
Rosa::: Pancakes, pancakes, making pancakes. Needs just a pinch of cinnamon. 
Ronnie Anne:::  Phase 1: Code Salty.
Rita:::  Mmm. That's delicious.
Lynn Sr.:::  I'll have to get your r-r-recipe.
Leni:::  Salty pancakes? That's different.
Rosa::: Salty?  Salados! Oh no. Saltiness is a sign of bad luck. 
Leni::: Ooh! More for me, then. 
Lincoln::: Phase 2: Code Black.
Carl:::  Phase 2.5: Code Shrink.
Rosa::: All the clothes are shrunk and turned black. This is a bad sign.
Carl:::  Oh yeah, Abuela! Really bad.
Hector:::  Híjole! Do I feel a breeze? 
Lana::: Phase 3: Code Flush.
CJ::: There she goes.
Lana::: And there she flows. 
Carlos:::  Frida, this book on the history of water slides is fascinating. It feels like I'm really there.
Frida::: Flood! 
Bobby::: You're making it worse! 
Rosa:::  Ahh! Aye ya yi!
Luan:::  Wahoo!
Carlos:::  Hurry, Mama, waterfall ahead.
Rosa::: Ay, mis bebes. Mama is coming.  Salty food, black laundry, floating coffins?  Now I understand.
Ronnie Anne::: That bad luck can happen anywhere?
Rosa::: Si.  Anywhere we go, because we are the bad luck.
Ronnie Anne::: Wait, what?
Rosa::: We must go where we can't hurt anyone. To the woods.
CJ::: What!?
Carlota::: Abuela, no.
Carl::: I hate nature, and nature hates me.
Ronnie Anne::: Can we please talk about this?
Rosa::: There's no time we must pack up right away! 
Lincoln::: Wow, I've never seen a plan backfire that hard before. I'll lend you my compass.
Ronnie Anne:::  The only way we're going to the woods is if Abuela drags us kicking and screaming.
Frida::: Carlos, do something!
Carlos::: Mama, be reasonable.  Oh, I hear the woods are lovely this time of year.
Sergio:::  Mama's boy.
Lana::: Say hi to the bears.
Ronnie Anne::: As soon as that gas tank is full, our lives are over.
Carlota::: Think they have wifi in the woods?  Couldn't you let me live in hope?!
Ronnie Anne::: May as well enjoy this last bit of civilization before we become forest people, I guess. I'm going to use a real bathroom while I still can.  Huh? The heck is all this?
Ernesto:::  No, no, I'm still on the road.  Oh yeah, muy bien, you have to cancel my next appearance too. Just say it's a curse again.  Que feil! This pimple has gotten even bigger. My fans can't see me like this.
Ronnie Anne::: Ernest Estrella?
Ernesto:::  Oh, a fan. I love fans.
Ronnie Anne::: You lied about Great Lakes City being cursed because of a pimple?!
Ernesto::: Oh, an angry fan. Estrella out! 
Ronnie Anne::: You're not on TV right now. That's not going to work. Thanks to you, my abuela made us leave Great Lakes City, and now she's taking us to live in the woods.
Ernesto:::  Aye, I didn't see that coming. I'm so sorry, muchacha. I never thought my words could cause so much trouble. Please, let me try to fix this.
Ronnie Anne:::  You better fix this!
Ernesto:::  You're very scary for your size.
Ernesto::: It is I, Ernesto Estrella, hold for applause.
Flip::: Who?
Hector:::  Oh look, it's the bo bo in person. Mucho gusto, Bo bo.
Ernesto::: The universe tells me… my biggest fan may have a bad luck problem.  Oh yes, there's the black cloud.  Don't worry Miss. Estrellitas. I'm here to help. Let's cleanse the Casagrandes!  I'll need coconut oil, candlesticks, your finest sage, and jasmine incense.
Flip::: We got flashlights, wilted flowers and pineapple air freshener. And you get a free flippee with that.
Ernesto::: That will have to do. A free flipper? Make it cherry.
Sergio:::  Ooh, finally some real talent to film. And action.
Ernesto::: Make sure to get my good side.
Female Voice::: Let's get cleansed.
Ernesto::: Vete!  Vete!  Vete!  Mala, suerte! Suerte! Suerte! You are all now…  Cleansed.
Rosa::: I feel it. The curse is lifted!
Ernesto::: What can I say? Ernesto is the besto. Booyah!  I meant to do that.
Rosa::: Thank you, Ernesto, you've saved mi familia. You truly are the besto.
Ernesto::: My pleasure. Don't forget to buy several copies of my new book. Es Tu Destino.
Rosa::: I pre-ordered it in three languages. And I've got something for that pimple.
Ernesto::: Estrella out!
Rosa::: I feel so relieved. I told you Ernesto was wonderful.
Ronnie Anne:::  Yeah, he was okay.
Rosa::: Familia, I think it's time to go home.  Oh, that could happen to anybody.
