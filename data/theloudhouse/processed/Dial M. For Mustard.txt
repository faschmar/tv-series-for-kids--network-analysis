Laird::: Ah... Ahhh!
Ronnie Anne:::  I'm working on a new trick, Dad! I call it vertigo, because it makes the person watching me super dizzy.
Arturo::: That made me worried more than dizzy, but you'll get there.
Bruno::: Hey, nice moves, Ronnie Anne! Let me guess: two dogs dragged through the garden?
Ronnie Anne::: Yep. Thanks, Bruno.
Bruno::: No charge. Just vote for me at the Great Lakes City hot dog contest tomorrow.  Winner gets two tickets to Vienna for a sausage tasting tour.  It's my dream trip.
Arturo::: “No hotdogs for me. I'm a judge and I must not allow myself to be influenced.”  “But, it smells... so good.  Be strong, Arturo.”
Ronnie Anne:::  “Yeah, you're definitely gonna win.”
Vito:::  “Of course he will. Bruno's hotdogs are the best in the city. We'll take the usual, please.”
Bruno::: “Three dogs with bad breath.”
Maybelle:::  “Bruno!”  “You put way too much relish on my hotdog. I demand a refund!”
Bruno::: “Sorry, Maybelle. After the second bite, you own it.”
Maybelle::: “You'll hear from my lawyer!”
Ronnie Anne::: “Dad! Remember you're a judge.”
Arturo::: “Fine. ¡Hasta mañana Bruno.”
Ronnie Anne::: “I call it 'vertigo'.”
Carl::: “I call it a fail.” 
Bruno:::  “Hey kids, you haven't seen my hotdog cart around here have you? It's got four wheels, an umbrella, smells like hotdogs.”
Carl::: I didn't do it.
CJ::: No.
Ronnie Anne::: “What happened?”
Bruno:::  “Ronnie Anne, after you and your dad left yesterday, I took my afternoon bathroom break, and when I got back, it was gone!”
Vito:::  “Bruno! Where you's been? We need our usual.”
Bruno::: “There's no more usual, Vito. Looks like my cart's been stolen.”
Vito::: “No hotdogs!?  No!”
Bruno::: “'Fraid so. Now I can't compete in the contest. Guess I'll never make it to Vienna now.”
Vito::: “Tough break, Bruno. We'll get through this together.”  No more hotdog.
CJ::: “That's so sad.”
Ronnie Anne::: “We have to help him find his cart.”
Carl::: “Sounds like a job for… Detective Carl. Step into my office.”  “Ouch.”
Carl::: “First things first, we'll need to determine who was in the park when the cart went missing.”
Ronnie Anne::: “I saw Laird, Maybelle, Vito and Abuelo.”
Carl:::  “Ronnie Anne! I'm the detective. As I was about to say…”  “The suspects are Laird, Maybelle, Vito and Abuelo.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Maybelle did seem really upset.”
Sergio:::  “My money's on Hector.”
Ronnie Anne::: “We'll have to question everyone.”
Carl:::  “Ronnie Anne! That's my line!”  ”A little help please.”
Carl:::  “Where were you yesterday at approximately four p.m?  Hm? Stealing a hotdog cart?!”
Laird:::  “I didn't do it. I got stuck in a tree while I was flying my kite. Look, someone even recorded it and posted it online.”
Sergio:::  “Ooh! that's gonna go viral!”
Maybelle::: “I was down the street at Cheesy's Pizza returning a slice. There was too much cheese.”
Carl::: “Likely story. CJ.”
CJ:::  “Her story checks out.”
Vito::: “Oh jeez. I don't know what I'll do without those hotdogs.
Carl:::  “Yeah, yeah, alright, you're clear. Get out of here.”
Hector::: “Bruno's hotdog cart? How should I know? I was napping.”  “Ooh, is it hot in here? Or is it just me? I mean, it's not me. I didn't do it!”  “Sorry, I get gassy when I'm nervous.”
Carl:::  “Smells to me like you're lying. If you are, you're gonna regret it.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Laird, Maybelle and Vito seem to be innocent.”
Carl::: “That leaves Abuelo, he's definitely hiding something. But what?”
Sergio:::  “Thanks for the snack.”
Bobby::: “Hey! That's my hotdog.” 
Ronnie Anne::: “Bobby! Where'd you get that dog?”
Bobby::: “It's a mercado dog. Abuelo's been perfecting his recipe for the hotdog competition.”
CJ::: “Abuelo's competing too?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Maybe he got rid of Bruno to eliminate the competition.”
Carl::: “Or he got rid of Bruno to eliminate the competition.”
CJ::: “How can we be sure?
Ronnie Anne::: “We'll have to find proof.”
Carl:::  “Or...”  “Ah! Come on!”
Ronnie Anne::: “Huh? Carlota, is that from yesterday?”
Carlota::: “Yeah, I'm making a new vlog post on fashion trends at the park.”
Ronnie Anne::: “But I didn't see you there.”
Carlota::: “One of the trends is camouflage.”
Ronnie Anne::: “This is right before Bruno's hotdog cart went missing.”  “Carlota, can you zoom in on Bruno's cart? We're trying to bust Abuelo.”
Carlota:::  “Okay.”
CJ::: “There's Abuelo.”
Carl::: “Abuelo took a hotdog! That's why he was acting guilty.”
Ronnie Anne::: “But he didn't take the cart.”
CJ::: “Then who did?”
Sergio::: “Look!”
Carlota::: “How did I not see a guy dressed as a hotdog?”  “Love the pickle shoes.”
Carl:::  “We find that hotdog, we find Bruno's cart. Let's go!”
Carlota::: “Uh, my computer?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Has anyone seen this hotdog?”
CJ::: “Look a pickle shoe. That's what the hotdog wore.”
Sergio:::  “Follow that bird!”
Carl::: “Fork it over Sancho! That shoe is a clue in our investigation.”  “Would this bag of chips change your mind?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Great work, Carl. Lalo can you track the scent?”
CJ::: “He's got it.”
Carl:::  “Pssh. We got a four-five-niner, delta, omega, baby shrimp, bubble butt. Ssh. Over.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Who are you talking to?”
Carl::: “Sorry, that's classified information.”
CJ::: “Hi-ho! Lalo! Away.”
Carl::: “We know you're in there, hotdog!”
Ronnie Anne::: “Look! Bruno's cart.”
CJ::: “And there's the hotdog!”
Carl::: “Follow that wiener!”
Sergio:::  “There's no escape!”  “Ah! I can't see!”
Carl:::  “He's getting away!”
Ronnie Anne::: “Not if I can help it.”
CJ::: “Vertigo!”
Carl::: “It's working!”
Sergio:::  “It's beautiful.”
Carl::: “This hotdog's cooked.”
Everyone::: “Vito?”
Carl::: “Oh yeah, I knew it all along.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Why Vito? You're Bruno's best customer. You love his hotdogs more than anything.”
Vito::: “That's why I did it. If Bruno wins and goes to Vienna I'll have to go a whole month without his hotdogs.”
Ronnie Anne::: “But you're crushing Bruno's dream.”
Vito::: “I know, I know, I was wrong. I came back to get the cart, I was gonna return it. I hope I'm not too late.”
Carl:::  “The contest starts in five minutes.”
Ronnie Anne::: “We can still make it. Let's go!”
Arturo::: “Thank you for your-”  “Famous, burp dog. Next, we have… Hector's mercado dog. Beautiful colour, the buns are warm and fluffy. Now for the taste.”  “Fantastico! Eight out of ten!”  “Did I say eight? I meant nine.”
Hector::: “Who made this bobo a judge?”
Arturo::: “Well, if there are no more hotdogs to taste…”  “...I'll announce the results. Ant the winner is…”
Bruno::: “My cart! You found it!”
Vito:::  “Whoa! Man, I should cut down on hotdogs.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Drag one through the garden, Bruno.”
Arturo::: “Our final contestant… Bruno!”  “I love what you did with the toppings.”  “Delicioso! A perfect ten! Bruno wins!”
Bruno::: “I can't believe it! My dreams have come true. And it's all because of my dear friends. Thank you kids.”
Hector::: “I owe you for a hotdog.”
Vito::: “Bruno, I took the cart. I didn't want to live without your hotdogs for a whole month. I'm sorry. Go to Vienna, I'll survive on Hector's eight out of ten hotdogs.”
Hector:::  “It was a nine!”
Bruno::: “Ah, Vito, buddy, you shouldn't have done that. But you know, I'd never leave you hanging.”  “I was gonna bring you to Vienna the whole time.”
Vito::: “Are you's kidding me? Unbelievable this guy. Come here you.”
Sergio:::  “I'll carry your bags.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Good work guys, case closed.”
Carl::: “Ronnie Anne! That's my line!”
