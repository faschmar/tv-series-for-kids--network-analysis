El Falcón::: Commissioner Gordo! What’s wrong?
Commissioner Gordo::: Aye! Falcon! It’s bad. El Dragon, La Cobra, and La Tortuga have teamed up to take over the city.
El Falcón::: Oh no!  You know what that means!
El Falcón & Carl::: Time to fly!
Carl:::  Bobby! You ruined my landing.
Bobby::: Oh, hey Carl. Guess what, I have a surprise for you.
Carl::: One... don't ever do that. And two... I'm watching El Falcon.
Bobby::: Trust me, this is better than watching El Falcon.
Carl:::  The real El Falcon? I take back all the bad things I’ve ever said about you behind your back.
Bobby::: Wait, what?
El Falcon::: Alright kids, your time's up.  Next!  Hello my falcon friend, what's your name?
Carl:::  Falcon, it's Carl Casagrande. Your biggest fan. Wanna see my chest tattoo?  Don't worry it washes off, but I'm never bathing again.
El Falcon::: Kid, you want an autograph of what?
Carl::: So Falcon, do you prefer your elote blaster or your elote daggers?
El Falcon::: Well they both have their…
Carl:::  Ooh! In episode two-thirteen, how’d you know the commissioner was an imposter?
El Falcon::: Well I...
Carl::: Would you ever want a sidekick? I could be El Pollito!
El Falcon:::  I don’t know kid! I’m just an actor, okay? None of this is real.
Carl:::  Not… real?
Bobby:::  Not cool, Falcon! He’s just kidding, Carl. Carl?  You call yourself a hero?
Frida:::  Mi pollito! Don't throw that away.
Carl:::  What's the point? El Falcon’s not real.  I've been looking up to a fake this whole time.
Carlos::: Not the ten-thousand piece El Falcon model. That took us six months to build.
Carl::: Six months down the drain!  My childhood may as well be over.
Frida::: Aye! This breaks my heart.
Bobby:::  This is all my fault! If only there was a way to make him believe in El Falcon again.  Wait! What if I dress up as El Falcon and convince Carl that he's real?
Ronnie Anne::: Doesn't El Falcon have like, powers and super strength?
Bobby::: No problem, I'm plenty strong.  But to make Carl really believe, I'm gonna need all of your help.
Bobby:::  Hold it right there, Carl!
Carl:::  Well look who it is, El Fake-on.
Bobby::: Oh that was... uh... an evil imposter you met earlier. Mm-hmm. I took care of him and came here to set the record straight.  Excuse me, Commissioner Gordo's calling on the falcon phone.
Carl:::  Yeah right.
Hector::: Falcon! Help! El Dragon’s robbing my… I mean the mercado.
Bobby::: Come on, Carl. Time to jet!
Carl::: Don't you mean time to fly?
Bobby::: Uh yes. Time to fly! Or walk, I mean the mercado's right here.
Sergio::: They’re coming! Places people!
Carlos::: I’m taking all of this food! For free.
Bobby::: El Dragon! Didn’t your mother ever teach you that stealing is wrong?
Carlos::: She did. So I told her to can it.  Later, Birdbrain. 
Bobby::: Falcon freeze!
Carlos::: Blast you Falcon! I can’t move.
Carl:::  How do I know you're not all faking it?  Let's find out.
Bobby::: Come on, Carl our work here is done.
Hector::: Luckily that's not my tickle spot.
Carl::: Big whoop. I’m still not convinced.
Bobby::: Well, maybe you'd like to take a ride in my Falcon-mobile!
Carl:::  Looks a lot bulkier than on TV.
Carlota:::  Not so fast Falcon! It is I, La Cobra.  Eat venom bird!  Later sss-quares.
Bobby::: Silly snake, I've got full control of the Falcon-mobile. Including the eject button.
Carl::: Awesome! I mean, not bad.
Bobby::: Sure, I love my elote blaster, but I really prefer my falcon claw.
Carl:::  Me too! It's my favorite item on your utility belt.  If you really are who you say you are.
Hector:::  Help! Falcon! The evil kingpin La Tortuga, has joined forces with the other villains!
Bobby::: Fear not! I'll lock them all up.
Rosa:::  Think again El Falcon!
Carl::: Falcon! Help!  Save me, Falcon!
Bobby::: Release the boy La Tortuga!
Rosa::: Who’s going to make me! Get him!
Carl::: Falcon!
Bobby::: Not so fast, foul turtle!
Hector:::  You’ve done it again, Falcon.
Bobby::: Well, now that the streets are safe, it's time for me to return to the Falcon Fortress.
Carl::: Wow, I can't believe I ever doubted you Falcon.
Frida::: He believes again!
Burglar::: Hey! Hands where I can see ‘em!  This is a robbery!
Hector::: Help! Help!
Carl::: Someone’s robbing the mercado!
Bobby::: Again?  Halt, criminal!  You don’t have to do this Tío Carlos, we’re good.  Tío Carlos? 
Frida:::  That's a real thief.
Carl:::  Oh man, do you know who you’re messing with? This is El Falcon.
Bobby:::  Well, let's not get the scary gentleman all worked up.
Burglar::: Whatever, Birdman.
Hector::: Ah, that bobo is stealing the van!  I mean that bird car thingy!
Carl::: What are you waiting for, Falcon?!  Use your ejector button!
Bobby:::  Of course.  Darn it! I left my phone in the Falconmobile earlier.
Carl::: Then use your Falcon claw.
Bobby:::  Here goes nothing.  Please don’t work.
Burglar::: Time to get rid of you, Birdbrain.
El Falcon:::  No, I can't make it to dinner tonight, I have to be at this dumb signing.  Si Mama, I know I used to like being a hero but, I don't see the point anymore.
Bobby::: Help!
El Falcon::: Mama! I have to call you back!
Burglar::: Hey! Would you quit it already?! 
Bobby:::  My phone.  Adios, thief.
Police Officer::: Hey! That’s him!
Bobby:::  I did it.
Carl:::  That was amazing El Fal-  Bobby?
Bobby:::  I think you mean, El Falcon!  My mask fell off, didn’t it?
Carl::: I way you the whole time?! You liar!
Bobby::: Carl, I felt so bad after the rio falcon was such a jerk to you. I just wanted you to keep believing.
Carl::: There's nothing to believe in anymore, there are no heroes, it's all fake including that dumb outfit. Take it off!
Bobby::: Come on, Carl, cut it out.  Woah, El Falcon.
Carl::: Oh, you mean the lying actor who plays El Falcon?
El Falcon::: Would an actor be able to do this? Time to fly!
Carl::: You are real!
Carl::: Really? This is the best day ever!  Mom! Mom! I'm gonna be El Falcon’s sidekick!
Bobby:::  So you can really fly?
El Falcon::: Nah, it's just a jetpack. Yeah, listen, I overheard what you did for the kid and it reminded me just how important my job as El Falcon is. Now if you'll excuse me I've got a signing to get to. And hey, I'm not the hero, you are.
Bobby:::  Wow, me, a real hero? Time to fly!  Time to cry.
