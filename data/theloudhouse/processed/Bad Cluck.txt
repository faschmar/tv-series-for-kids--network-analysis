Sergio::: “Ah, what to wear?”  Ah! I hate all my clothes. Ooh.”  “Forgot about these.”  “Me like.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Guys, hey, I can't see.”  “Ooh, get ready for La Tormenta's signature move, in three… two…”
Sergio:::  “What'd I miss?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Aw man! I missed the move.”
Carl::: “Woah, cool shades Sergio.”
Sergio:::  “Tell me something I don't know. Vintage classics.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Oh good, they're showing the instant replay.”  “Abuelo, the TV's on the fritz again.”
Hector::: “Come on!”
Frida:::  “That toy is creepy! Carlos, please take out the battery.”
Carlos::: “That's odd, I haven't put the battery in it yet.”
Hector:::  “Ah! What's wrong.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Abuelo, stop, you fixed it.”
Carl::: “Ew! Sergio laid an egg.”
Sergio::: “Wasn't me! It was Carl.”
Carl::: “Was not. Mom!”
Frida::: “Of course you didn't lay an egg mi pollito.”
Carlos::: “Yes, scientifically im-”
Rosa:::  “I know what this is, we're being haunted!”
Ronnie Anne:::  “We are not being haunted.”  “Someone's obviously pranking us. There's gotta be string somewhere.”  “Okay, no strings. Carl, how are you doing this?”
Carl::: “Don't look at me, look at that!”
Frida, Carlos, Bobby, CJ & Carl::: “Chicken ghost!”
Sergio:::  Human shield!
Rosa::: Everyone! Hide under the table with me quick!
Carlota:::  “I think we lost him.”
CJ::: “Think again.”
Carlota::: “At least all that water got the egg out of my hair.”
Mr. Nakamura:::  “Knock knock.”  “It's just me. I hear there's a ghost in the building.”
Rosa::: “Is it haunting you too!?”
Mr. Nakamura::: “No, Hector texted me.”  “I think I can help. Is it a good ghost or a bad ghost?”
Carl::: “It's a chicken ghost.”
Bobby::: “And it's definitely bad, it egged me.”
Mr. Nakamura:::  “Well don't worry Casagrandes'. In Japan, there's a spring festival where we throw beans to chase off evil spirits.”
Rosa::: “It's worth a try.”
Mr. Nakamura::: “Now throw the beans with purpose.”
Everyone::: “Ghost be gone!”
Hector::: “This family's not gonna let good food go to waste. Ghost or no ghost.”
Mr. Nakamura::: “If you'll excuse me, now, I must be gone.”
Stanley::: “Hey there Casagrandes'. Hector texted, I hear you have a ghost. Could it be an ancestor?”
Carl:::  “Not unless we're related to a chicken.”
Hector::: “That would be on Rosa's side.”
Stanley::: “Well my family uses snap pops to scare off ghosts. We usually do it on New Years, but no reason we can't try it now.”  “On my count. Three… Two… One… Happy new year!”  “I mean, get out of here ghost.”
Carl:::  “Take that ghost chicken.”
Stanley::: “I wasn't expecting the ghost chicken to have his own fireworks, impressive. And also…”
Arturo::: “Hola familia! I brought some ají verde salsa from Peru, so bring on the chicken.”
Rosa::: “Hector, chismoso, did you tell everyone?”
Ronnie Anne:::  “Does salsa help with chicken ghosts?”
Arturo:::  “Chicken ghost? I thought you were eating chicken.”
Sergio:::  “He's the chicken!”
Arturo::: “You're not wrong.”
Sergio::: “Hey! Watch it!”
Frida:::  “We're good people!”  “Why are you haunting us!?”
Carlota::: “Hey, that arrows totally pointing to Sergio.”
Sergio:::  “Is not.”
Everyone else::: “Is too.”
Rosa::: “Sergio, do you know this chicken?”
Sergio::: “I had a chicken roommate at flight school, but he moved to a farm, never heard from him again.”  “Alfredo, is that you?”  “Yup, that's him.”
Rosa::: “Ghosts don't stick around unless they have unfinished business. Sergio, did you wrong this chicken?”
Sergio::: “No, he loved me.”  “I mean, we were rivals, but we were friendly rivals.”  “Okay, okay, there was this one time.”  “What, it was just a little poop. Can't you take a joke, Al?”
Rosa::: “Sergio Casagrande! No wonder he's angry! You have to make it up to him, it's the only way to get rid of this ghost.”
Sergio::: “Okay, okay, I'll make amends.”  “Let's see, I have a little time next month.”
Rosa:::  “Sergio!”
Sergio::: “Oh look, I'm free today.”
Sergio::: “Here it is, Alfredo's car. Okay, let's get to work, I'll supervise.”
Carl:::  “We didn't poop on it.”
Sergio::: “Well if you're gonna get technical, sheesh.”  “Lookin' good.”  “There, cleaned your car, ya happy?”  “Not so happy.” 
Carlota::: “Sergio, are you sure you didn't do anything else to that chicken?”
Flashback Sergio::: “Let me clean that up for you Al.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Sergio, you ruined his birthday party?”
Carl::: “No wonder he's angry.”
Sergio::: “Okay, okay, I'll make it up to him.”  “Not helping, Sancho!”
All:::  “Cumpleaños feliz, cumpleaños feliz, cumpleaños feliz, now go away please!”
Sergio::: “Are we square now?”
CJ::: “Guess not.”
Carlota:::  “Anything else you'd like to tell us, Sergio?”
Sergio::: “Okay, there might be a tiny bit more to the story.”
Flashback Sergio:::  “Ooh, my lucky day.”  “Everything's coming up Sergio.”
Ronnie Anne::: “So let me get this straight; you pooped on his car, ruined his birthday party, and stole his wallet?”
Sergio::: “Yeah.”
Sergio::: “Okay, here's all of the money I took.”  “With interest.”  “Oh come on, I've made amends, for everything, what more do you want?”
Alfredo::: “Bawk, bawk.”  “That's not the end of the story. Bawk, bawk.”
Carl & Carlota:::  “My dad's a chicken?”
Frida:::  “Carlos!”  “I will always love you!”
Rosa::: “Sergio! What else did you do to this chicken?!”
Flashback Sergio::: “Sorry about your car crash buddy. Tough break.”  “Ooh, dig the shades.”  “Mind if I borrow them? You don't need 'em, no sun in here.” 
Sergio::: “Oh, that's where I got these glasses.”
Alfredo:::  “Give them back! Bawk, bawk!”
Sergio::: “But they look so good on me.”
Carl::: “Give him the glasses!”
Sergio::: “How 'bout a nice toaster? Fancy smoothie maker? Or how about Carl? Take him.”
Carl::: “Hey!”
Hector::: “Sergio, give him those glasses! Right now!”
Sergio::: “Fine! Take the glasses.”
Carlota:::  “It worked.”
Frida:::  “Mi amor! You're not a chicken anymore.”
Carlos::: “Thank heavens.” 
Rosa::: “Well Sergio, I hope there are no other ghost chicken's out there that you've wronged.”
Sergio:::  “No way, I promise.”  “What? You didn't ask about cows.”
