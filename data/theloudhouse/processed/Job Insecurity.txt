Lori::: Dad must have been so caught up making us breakfast that he forget his work stuff.  Luna, will you run Dad's laptop up to him?
Luna::: And leave my breakfast sandwich with you animals? That's a neg, dude.
Leni::: I'll do it. I trust you guys.
Lori::: You guys, not cool.  As the oldest, I totally get her sandwich.
Leni::: Hey, Dad, we saw you forgot your laptop at home and--  Oh, I can't believe you get to have plastic surgery, but I can't get my belly button pierced?
Employee::: Uh, you must be looking for Lynn Loud Sr. I'm sorry, but he doesn't work here anymore. He's been gone for three weeks.
Siblings::: Three weeks?!
Lisa::: Based on my calculations, it appears our father's employment was terminated immediately following the most recent Take Your Kids to Work Day.
Lincoln::: You don't think we had anything to do with it, do you?
Lori::: We're literally the worst.
Leni::: Now I can't even eat that delicious sandwich he made. I feel too guilty.
Lori::: Me too.
Lola::: Wait, if Daddy hasn't had a job for three weeks, where's he even going when he leaves the house every morning?
Lisa::: I believe I can locate him.  I recently implanted a tracking chip in both our parental units.
Lucy::: A tracking chip? You didn't put those in us, did you?
Lisa:::  Noooo...
Lisa::: Lori, turn due southeast.  We appear to have arrived at Father's location.
Lynn::: The Aloha Comrade Hawaiian/Russian fusion restaurant? What's he doing here?
Leni::: Poor guy must be drowning his sorrows in Humuhumunukunukuapua'a borscht.
Leni's siblings:::  Whaaaaat?
Leni::: Have you guys never really heard of borscht?
Lola::: Dad's a dishwasher?
Lucy::: But he hates doing dishes.
Luan::: Yeah, and now that's his job-- because of us.
Lynn::: This is worse than the time we ruined his 40th birthday party.
Leni::: And his college reunion.
Luna::: And his roller dance competition.
Lisa::: And his colonoscopy.
Lori:::  Guys, Dad does so much for us, and all we do is make his life worse.
Lincoln::: It's true. We really need to fix this, and I know how. We're gonna get Dad a new and better job.
Leni::: We just all need to work together!
Lana::: Oh, guys, someone threw out a perfectly good pineapple stroganoff.
Lola:::  I've got the perfect job for Daddy: figure skater!
Lynn::: No way! Soccer goalie!
Lucy::: Uh-uh. Beat poet.
Beatnik Lynn Sr.::: Darkness, despair, lack of hair.
Lisa::: Need I remind you, Father has only one monetizable skill set: information technology, street name: IT.
Lincoln:::  Oh! What about this? Computer expert needed for internet start-up.
Leni::: I thought someone already started the internet.
Lori::: This is good.  Let's fill out an application and send it in.  And...done! 
Lana::: Yes! They liked Dad's application and want him to come in for an interview.
Luna::: Wait. What if he doesn't get the gig? Then we'll have gotten his hopes up for nothing.
Lincoln::: How about we get the job for him, then surprise him with it?
Lisa:::  So, you're saying we clone Dad while he's sleeping and send the clone to the interview? Great idea! I underestimated you, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Actually, I was thinking one of us could just put on this wig and pretend to be Dad. 
Lisa:::  Ah. So I overestimated you.
Lori::: I know the perfect person to play Dad.
Lucy:::  So, Mr. Loud, why should we hire you?
Lori:::  Because I've literally mastered technology.
Lori::: Hi, Boo-Boo Bear. Carol said what?  Can I get some privacy?
Lincoln:::  You should hire me because I'm responsible and mature.  This tie is strangling me!  Oh, I'm sweating in this suit! These pants are giving me a rash!  Ah. Now, where were we?
Luan:::  Lynn Loud Sr. Pleased to meet you.  What's the buzz around here?  Get it?
Lana:::  Who are we kidding? None of us can pull this off.
Lincoln::: There must be somebody who can make a convincing Dad.
Mr. Grouse:::  Ooh, look at me! I'm Lynn Loud Sr.! I can leave my trash bins out as long as I want!
Lincoln::: Mr. Grouse, could you do us a small favor?
Mr. Grouse::: Hard pass. 
Lincoln:::  Hey, wait. Would a tray of my Dad's lasagna change your mind?
Mr. Grouse::: No.  But two would. 
Mr. Grouse::: Mmm-mmm!  I'd like to be alone with my lasagna.
Lincoln::: These are for later, Mr. Grouse. First, we need to get you trained so you'll fit into the world of IT.
Mr. Grouse::: Ah, you kids and your fancy abbreviations. In my day, we just said 'It'.
Lynn::: Okay, Mr. Grouse. Here's a laptop.  Boot it up.
Mr. Grouse:::  Will you settle for a penny loafer? 
Lynn:::  No, no! Not like that! Like this. 
Luan::: Okay, now open a window.
Mr. Grouse:::  Eh...alright. 
Luan:::  Good one. But wrong.  Like this.
Lisa::: Now you need to empty the trash on your computer.
Mr. Grouse::: Eh, whatever you say. 
Lisa::: Yeah, I walked right into that one.
Luna::: Yo, IT dude!  I mean, how are you, sir? My computer's acting totally bogus-  I-I mean, broken. So, yeah, can you fix it?
Mr. Grouse::: Well, let's see.  Have you rebooted?  Have you checked your Wi-Fi connection?  Uh...ah, it's clear as daylight. You need to update your drivers. 
Lincoln::: I think he's ready.
Lynn::: Almost. 
Lori:::  It's been three hours. Where is he?
Lisa:::  Passing the Cluverius residence, about to make a right onto Franklin.
Lana::: How'd you know that?
Lisa:::  Just a wild guess.
Mr. Grouse:::  Oh, sorry, kids.  Psych! I got the job!  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with two hot dishes...  Of lasagne, for Pete's sake! 
Loud Kids::: GOOD MORNING, DAD!
Lynn Sr.::: Dang it! What's going on, kids?
Lincoln::: Get in! We're driving you to work.
Lynn Sr.::: Uh...okay.  But there's something I have to tell you. I have a new job now.
Luna::: Yes, you do. 
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, dang it!
Lynn Sr.:::  Wait. This isn't the Aloha Comrade.
Lori::: We know! Say hello to your new office.
Lucy::: We felt bad about getting you fired from your old IT job. So, we got you a new one.
Lynn Sr.::: Uh, guys. You didn't get me fired from my old job. I quit.
Lola::: Why?! So you could wash icky dishes?
Lynn Sr.::: Mmm, not exactly. I'm training to become a chef, my dream job! And washing dishes is how you start. I didn't wanna tell you guys until I passed my training period.
Loud Kids:::  Oh...
Lisa::: It's the colonoscopy all over again.
Lynn Sr.:::  It's-it's okay, kids. You meant well.  And now that you know, you can just take me back to the restaurant.
Lincoln:::  Uh, we kind of already quit for you.
Lola:::  YOU LISTEN TO ME, BUB! NO ONE MAKES MY DADDY WASH DISHES! HE'S DONE WITH YOUR STINKY JOB IN YOUR STINKY RESTAURANT! AND ANOTHER THING--
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, dear.
Lincoln:::  Don't worry, Dad. We'll talk your boss into rehiring you.
Loud Sisters::: Yeah! To the Aloha Comrade!
Luna::: PUNCH IT, LORI!
Lynn Sr.::: Wait!  Ooh... that was hot!
Sergei::: Oh, no! This is my last clean plate! 
Lincoln::: Sir, please give our dad his job back. This was all a misunderstanding.
Sergei:::  What is there to misunderstanding? First, I get the rudest call of my life. Then I have no one to help with the breakfast rush. So, my answer is <abbr title=nyet>нет</abbr>!
Leni:::  YAY!
Lisa::: <abbr title=nyet>нет</abbr> means 'no.'
Leni:::  Aw...
Lynn:::  Please don't punish our dad. This was our fault.
Lori::: Yeah. We're always messing up.
Lincoln::: All we do is make his life worse.
Lynn Sr.::: Whoa, whoa, kids, what are you talking about? You make my life better every day. This is just a job. Don't worry. I can find another one.
Sergei::: I can't say <abbr title=nyet>нет</abbr> to a man with such a nice family. You got your job back!
Louds::: YAY!!!
Lola::: YES! MY DADDY'S GONNA WASH THE DISHES!
Sergei:::  Ah! You!   Ooh! Ow, my cooking arm.
Lynn Sr.::: Chef Sergei!
Lisa:::  Hmm. Appears to be a hairline fracture. You'll need to keep that immobilized for at least three weeks.
Sergei::: I'm sorry, Lynn. I know I just gave your job back, but I'm going to have to shut down for a while.
Lincoln:::  Maybe not!
Leni::: OMGosh, you guys! The dining room is packed!
Lori:::  Everyone loves Dad's Kona caviar breakfast sandwiches.
Sergei:::  Mmm. Lynn, you don't need to train to be a chef. You already are one! Forget about the dish washing. I'm making you my co-chef.
Sergei:::  Come with me. I want the customers to know who made this delicious meal.
Lola:::  Ooh! Sergei didn't finish his breakfast sandwich!
Loud Kids::: DIBS!!!
Mr. Grouse::: There you go. All fixed.
Customer::: Uh, great. Thanks. Could you log out for me?
Mr. Grouse::: Sure.  Good thing I brought a log.
