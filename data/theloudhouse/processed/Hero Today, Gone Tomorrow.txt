Lynn::: Come on, Margo, better get our protein on before the game. Those Beaverton Bees are going down.
Margo:::  Down to loser-
Lynn & Margo:::  town. Huah! Whoo-whoo-whoo!
Burpin' Burger Man:::  Lynn Loud, what's a star like you doing standing in line on game day? You should be saving your energy for the field.
Burpin' Burger Mom::: Yeah! You gotta keep that ten game scoring streak going.
Margo:::  Actually, it's eleven.
Grant::: Sup, LJ? Your usual pre-game special?
Lynn::: You know it.
Lynn & Margo::: Two double belchers, extra pickles, extra onions, triple hot sauce!
Margo::: Thanks for turning me on to this burg. I think it's really taken' my game up a notch.
Lynn::: Ah, I know, right?  It's all about converting fire to fuel.
Burpin' Burger Dad:::  Don't mean to bother you gals, but my little one would love to meet Lynn Loud. She's a huge fan, she even made her own jersey.
Lynn::: Honored to meet you. You coming to the game today?  Cool. I'm gonna score a goal just for you.  Sorry about all this. It's not like I'm the only player on the team.
Margo::: Psssh, you deserve all the credit you get. You're amazing.
Lynn::: And you're an amazing friend. Burger high five!
Lynn:::  Paula! Paula!
Soccer Coach:::  Take a knee, Kangaroos.  Paula, you can stand. Okay. Scores tied, but we just have enough time for one last play. Just get the ball to Lynn and let her do her thing.
Lynn::: Quadruple teamed?! Are you kidding?  Take the shot,  Margo!
Margo::: I...I can't believe it.
Lynn:::  That was incredible!
Everyone (except Paula)::: Margo! Margo! Margo!
Paula:::  Is this weird for you?
Lynn::: What? Why?
Paula::: We're usually carrying you after a game.
Lynn::: Pffft, it's not weird at all. I'm happy to share the spotlight.
Everyone (except Paula)::: Margo! Margo!
Cici::: Amazing.
Paula::: Wow.
Lynn:::  What are you guys watching? Is it that video where the dolphin takes down the shark? 'Cause I fall asleep to that every night.
Byron::: No, it's Margo's play at yesterday's game.  Check it out.
Lynn:::  I saw it, I was there.
Byron:::  Be quiet. Here it comes.
Paula::: Amazing.
Cici::: Sick.
Lynn::: Uh, the special effects seem a little over the top, but-
Cici::: Look, there she is!
Cici, Byron, and Boy::: Margo! Margo! Margo!
Paula:::  Are you sure this isn't weird? Cause, we're usually cheering for you.
Lynn:::  Paula, I'm fine. Don't you have German right now?
Lynn::: Hey, I know you know this, but I just wanna say how happy I am for y-
Coach Keck:::  Yo, forget the sit-ups and circle up.  Margo, come on over here. I have seen some amazing athletic feet in my day, but nothing like that kick. Tell us how you did it.
Margo:::  Oh, I...I don't know.
Coach Keck::: Ah, don't be shy. Modesty's for losers.
Margo:::  Okay. Well, I've been practicing for a while, and a lot of it is timing.
Coach Keck:::  Feldman! Kumar! Quit pickin' your wedgies. A star's talkin'!
Mr. Bolhofner::: Okay, people, pencils out, books away. We're starting with a pop quiz on polynomials.  Quiz for you, and quiz for you. No quiz for Margo, you get a pass for whooping those Beaverton Bees.  My ex-wife is their assistant coach.
Margo::: Oh. Uh, thanks, Mr. Bolhofner.
Mr. Bolhofner:::  Quiz for you,  and quiz for you.
Librarian Wetta::: You're Margo Roberts, aren't you?
Margo:::  Yes. I know, I have a fine.
Librarian Wetta::: Oh no, not that, I saw your play on the news. It was so inspiring, I started a librarian soccer league! Consider the fine taken care of.
Margo::: Wow, thank you.
Librarian Wetta::: Uh-oh, I can't let you check this out. You owe $7.25 in late fees.
Lynn::: You know, I play soccer too. I'm in the midst of a twelve game goal streak.
Librarian Wetta::: I didn't see that on the news.
Lynn & Margo::: Whoo-whoo-whoo! Whoo-whoo-whoo!
Burpin' Burger Mom::: There she is. Margo!
Burpin' Burger Man:::  Hey, what's it like being on a team with a superstar, huh, Lynn?
Margo:::  Psssh. As Lynn and I like to say, There's no 'I' in team. 
Burpin' Burger Man::: But there is an 'M', and it's for MARGO!
Margo:::  Sorry about all this weird attention I've been getting.
Lynn:::  Oh, don't worry about it. You totally deserve it.  Hey, where's the Double Belcher?
Grant::: Oh, we just renamed it The Margo Miracle. It's been our bestseller today.
Margo::: Wow, really? We'll take two.
Lynn:::  Great...
Burpin' Burger Dad::: Sorry, Margo, my little one would love to meet you. She's a huge fan, she even made her own jersey.
Margo:::  Awwww.
Lincoln::: Are you okay? Your anger vein is doing that thing it does.
Lynn:::  No. I'm not okay. I've been carrying my soccer team all season. I'm the top goal scorer, I bust my butt every game, then one fluke shot and poof! Everyone loses their minds!
Lincoln::: Sorry, Lynn. I got distracted.  I was just watching a video of Margo's amazing kick.
Lynn:::  Oh, that does it! 
Lynn::: People want fancy shots?  LJ's gonna give them fancy shots.
Margo:::  Hey, how come you weren't at the Burpin' Burger today? You feeling okay?
Lynn::: Yeah, wasn't hungry, that's all.
Paula:::  That's weird, isn't it? She's always hungry.
Lynn::: No sweat. Lots of ways to make a big play.
Margo:::  Over here!
Lynn:::  Come on, Lynn, only one minute left.  Here! Here!  Woo-hoo! LJ all day baby!
Lynn's team except Margo:::  Lynn, Lynn, Lynn, Lynn, Lynn, Lynn!
Cici::: Sweet goal yesterday!
Boy::: Up top.
Lynn:::  Yo, yo, Margo!  Huh. Guess she didn't hear me.
Byron:::  Lynn, I got your play in HD. I'm adding special effects right now.
Lynn::: Aw, you don't need to do all that. Though maybe when I hit the ball, it could make like a... 
Cici::: Oh, yeah.
Byron::: Good note.
Lynn:::  Oh, hey Margo.
Coach Keck:::  Gather 'round guys, Lynn's gonna tell us about her miraculous play.
Lynn::: Well, if you insist.  There I was, a minute left on the clock, the whole game riding on me.
Librarian Wetta::: Well, well, if it isn't Royal Woods' star athlete.  Oops, you've still got that fine, but we can take care of that.
Margo's Voicemail::: Go for Margo.
Lynn:::  Hey, it's me, again. I was just wondering where you are and if you want to get a burg with me. Haven't seen you all day. Okay, bye. 
Burpin' Burger Teen:::  Look! It's Lynn Loud!  Soccer-star selfie! 
Burpin Burger Dad::: We thought Margo's kick was amazing, but your move blew us away.
Grant::: LJ, check it out, we renamed 'The Margo Miracle', 'The Loud Rebound' in your honor. Now it comes with fries and a drink.
Lynn::: I'll take a dozen!
 Lynn::: Protein for my players!  'Loud Rebound' for you, and for you.  Heads up, Margo! 'Loud Rebound' comin' at 'cha!  What gives? You don't just let good meat fall to the ground like that.
Margo:::  I'm not hungry.
Lynn::: Do you wanna work out some plays before the game?
Margo::: No thanks, you'll probably just end up doing your own thing anyway.
Lynn::: What's that supposed to mean?
Margo:::  So you didn't spend the whole last game trying to make a big play so you could get the spotlight back?
Lynn:::  Okay, maybe I did, so what? I deserve that spotlight. I've worked really hard for it!
Margo::: That's not the point Lynn. I never minded being in your shadow, but it seems like you can't do the same for anyone else.  Even for a second! Even for a friend.
Paula:::  So, you and Margo used to be besties, but now,  there's a literal beef between you.
Lynn::: Hey, Margo.  Can I talk to you?! Wait up!  Margo, I know I can be really competitive-  Can you guys lay off?! I'm trying to apologize here!
Soccer Coach::: Okay, girls. There's one minute left. Just get, the ball, to Lynn.
Lynn::: Well, don't forget about Miracle Margo. This is a team sport.
Lynn::: Margo! Take it!
Margo:::  What are you doing?! 
Lynn::: It's all you, Margo.
Margo:::  Why!?  You had an open-- shot!
Lynn:::  Listen, you were right. When you were getting all that attention, I should've just been happy for you, the way you always are for me,   I'm sorry.
Margo:::  Well thanks, I appreciate the apology. Here,  Go win the game for us.
Lynn:::  No, I want you to take the shot.
Margo:::  No, I want you to have it.
Lynn:::  No, seriously, you really should.
Margo:::  I insist. 
Lynn:::  Please, you go.
Paula's Mom::: That's my Paula!
Margo::: Well, looks like the spotlight's off both of us now.
Lynn::: Eh, I don't mind. Let her enjoy the attention while it lasts.
Lynn & Margo:::  Paula! Paula!
Burpin' Burger Teen::: Look, it's Paula!
Paula::: First, this is the 'Margo Miracle', then it was the 'Loud Rebound', and now it's the 'Holla for Paula'! That must be really weird for you guys.
Margo::: Psssh.
Lynn::: Nah, it's delicious no matter what you call it.
Lynn & Margo::: Burger high five!
