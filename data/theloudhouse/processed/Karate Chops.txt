Alexis::: Wow, Carl. We've only been in class two weeks, and you're already our star student.
Carl::: Mwah!
Tom::: Yeah. Sweet moves.
Alexis::: I've been taking karate here for months.  And I still can't even tie my belt right. 
Carl::: My mom ties my belt. But I got the mad karate skills. If you ask nice, I don't mind helping you guys out. 
Par::: Alright, my awesome trio, big news! We're now a class of four!
Carl::: Adelaide?! I mean, Adelaide.
Adelaide::: Carl.
Par::: This is great! Since you guys already know each other, why don't you show her the ropes, Carl?
Carl::: Sure, sensei. I'd love to show her! Show her who's number one... 
Alexis::: Wow, Adelaide! How'd you do that?
Adelaide::: I just did what Sensei Par said to do.
Carl::: Beginner's luck! I was going easy on you 'cause it's your first time. It is your first time, right?
Adelaide::: Yup! But it seems pretty simple.
Carl::: Or so you think! Time to get serious!  Beginner's luck...
Carl::: Beginner's luck...
Carl::: Beginner's luck...
Alexis::: She tied my belt.
Tom::: Wow.
Par::: Amazing.  Hey, Carl. Take a picture of me and my new star student.
Carl::: Say cheese!
Par::: Thanks. I'll treasure this forever.
Adelaide::: I guess it's not Beginner's Luck.
Carl::: Yep. She's gotta go.  And I know just how to do it. 
Frida::: I'm here to take you home, mi amor.
Carl:::  Mom, you ruined my scheming moment.
Frida::: I'm sorry, mijo.  Just pretend I'm not even here. I'll cover my ears.
Carl::: Thank you. 
Carl::: And now the glue.
Ronnie Anne::: Uh, what are you two doing?
Sid::: And why is Carl laughing like that?
Sergio:::  We're rigging a b-- 
Carl::: Remember whose dessert you're getting for a whole week, bird.
Ronnie Anne::: I don't wanna know. Let's go, Sid.
Sid::: Right. We gotta work on the new and improved Breakfast Bot. I added a fruit prep function. Let's see how he does with apples.
Sid::: Hmm. Needs work.
Carl::: Go to work, Sergio.
Carl::: Perfecto! Easy-to-break cracker boards complete. 
Sergio::: Rubber boards done too.
Carl::: Sweet. Let's try it out.  Perfect.
Carl::: Quick! Cue the challenge music.  Not that song! 
Sergio::: Don't touch my boom-box!
Carl::: Hurry up! 
Adelaide::: What do you want, Carl? Sugar, Sugar Rainbow Unicorn Friendship Hour is on. I'm missing the intro.
Carl::: Adelaide Chang, I hereby challenge you to a board breaking duel tomorrow. Hiya!  Loser leaves karate class... forever!
Adelaide::: No thanks. 
Carl::: What? OK, I get it. You're too scared.
Adelaide:::  Ugh, fine. I'll duel with you. But don't cry to me when you have to leave the class after I win.  Sugar, Sugar Rainbow Unicorn Friendship Hour...
Carl:::  Oh. You're going down. 
Carl::: Good luck.
Par::: Okay. I didn't know we were having a contest tonight, but I'm glad you guys are so motivated. And start!
Alexis::: Wow. You're snapping these like twigs.
Sergio:::  Or crackers.  Ow!
Adelaide:::  What the heck?! 
Par::: And time.  Carl broke... fourteen? Wow! Amazing! And Adelaide,  zero?
Carl::: Yeah! Whoa! I so kicked your butt.
Adelaide::: Congratulations, Carl. I guess I'm quitting class now.
Par::: Wait. You're leaving?
Adelaide::: Yep. I promised.
Par::: That's a bummer. And it changes my plans a lot. Carl, I was gonna ask Adelaide, but now you're my last hope. Can you do a board breaking demonstration at your school tomorrow?
Carl::: Can I? You got it. I'm the star student after all.
Par::: Ah, great. You're a lifesaver. 
Carl::: We're gonna need more fake boards.
Sergio:::  Coming right up. 
Carl::: Ready to go, Par. Just tell me where I should put the boards.
Par::: No need, brah. We're using these special promo boards I had made. Check it. 
Par Board::: Oh, yeah! Join Par's Dojo.
Par::: Pretty sweet, huh?
Carl:::  Yeah. Sweet.
Par::: I'm glad you think so.  Uh, between you and me, we really need to impress the kids and get them to join the class or the dojo is going out of business.
Carl:::  Out of business? Forever?
Par::: Well, yeah. Our class is super small. And losing Adelaide was really tough. That was a quarter of our money right there.  Anyway, go ahead and warm up. I'm gonna go get the banner I made.  It also has my face on it.
Carl::: What do we do now, Sergio? The dojo won't close if we don't do the demonstration.  And karate class is my favorite.  Maybe I'm strong enough now.  Ow!  Kiss it better. Kiss it better.
Sergio:::  Ew. Kiss it yourself.
Carl:::  Mwah. We need a plan.
Sergio::: You're on your own, buddy. I've already got your dessert for the next week. My advice?  Find another way to cheat. 
Carl::: Another way to cheat?  Oh! I got it! If I can't use fake boards anymore, then I just need something that can break the real ones. Hmm... But what's strong enough?
Sid::: Ooh.  All right, Breakfast Bot! You finally got apples. Let's try a harder fruit now. Maybe coconut? Pineapple? I'll check the cafeteria. Be right back.  Oh. Hey, Carl.
Par::: And now, to show you how awesome karate is and how good I am at teaching it, meet our class's star student, Carl Casagrande!
Carl::: Hiya!
Student #1::: Ooh.
Student #2::: Wow.
Par Board::: Oh, yeah! Join Par's Dojo.
Par Board::: Oh, yeah!
Par Board::: Oh, yeah!
Par Boards:::  Oh, yeah!
Sid::: Huh? Weird. Why isn't it working?
Carl::: What?
Sid::: Let's try it on a higher setting.
Par::: Carl, is everything okay?
Carl:::  Does it look okay? 
Girl:::  His arm fell off!
Boy::: Hey! Those aren't real arms!
Sid::: There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you guys.
Woman::: Par's Dojo stinks!
Par::: Goodbye, dojo.
Boy::: This was lame.
Carl::: Everyone, wait.  Okay. I cheated. Yes.  But Par is a great sensei, and our dojo is cool. I can prove it.  Adelaide is...  a karate genius who Par trained.  I'm sorry. I cheated before too so I could get you to leave class. I just liked being the best one there.
Adelaide:::  What are you saying, Carl?
Carl:::  Ugh, you're really milking this, aren't you? I'm saying you're better than me.  So please do the demo and save the dojo.
Adelaide:::  All I needed to hear was that I'm better. Let's do this.
Par::: All right! Roll that music!
Par Boards::: Oh yeah!
Par Boards::: Oh yeah! Join Par's Dojo. 
Students::: Wow! She's so cool. I believe again! Sign me up!
Carl::: I will train harder. And one day, I'll be the best. 
Breakfast Bot:::  You'll have to defeat me first. 
Carl::: Huh?
