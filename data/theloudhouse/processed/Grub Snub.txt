Clyde:::  Gus' Games & Grub, you never disappoint.  After a long week of sixth grade, there's nowhere I'd rather throw back a few cold glasses of water.  That's good tap.
Gus::: One spaghetti pizza for my favorite customers. 
Sixth graders::: Mmm...
Gus::: I only make this for my most regular regulars. Speaking of... Stella,  I found your hoodie, washed it then dried it in the pizza oven.
Stella::: Ooh, pizza pressed.  Hey, there's a pepperoni in my sleeve.  Mmm...
Gus::: Liam, we got your special seat cushion right here.
Liam:::  Nothin' better on your behind than a bale of hay.
Gus:::  And Rust-Man, heard the good news about your report card.  As promised, here's a game token, for every A.
Rusty::: Yes!  Thank you, wood shop!
Lincoln::: And thank you, Gus, for making us feel like family.
Gus::: You're welcome, kids. Enjoy that pizza.
Stella::: Oh, Lincoln, isn't that your sister?
Leni:::  Hey, Lincoln.  It's, like, totes packed in here. Mind if we share your booth?
Lincoln::: Well, it's already-  Full.
Mandee:::  Is that spaghetti pizza?
Jackie::: Yuuuum!
Miguel::: I'm starving!
Fiona::: Oh, can I have a slice?
Lincoln::: Oh. Well, I guess.  So, what are you guys doing here?
Clyde::: Yeah, don't you guys usually hang out at the mall?
Jackie::: Usually.  But Dim Yum is closed.
Miguel::: Yeah, but the skee-ball is open! Come on, let's play some games!
Jackie::: Yay!
Miguel::: Aww, yeah!
Zach:::  They ate all of our pizza. Now they're playing all of our games?
Liam::: Y'all, they're takin' over this place like skeeters on a sugar sucker!
Lincoln::: Guys, it's OK- it's only for an afternoon. We can still have fun...
Rusty::: Mind if I get next? I don't get A's very often.
Fiona::: Sorry, dude. Miguel's gonna be here for a while; he's on a roll.
Miguel::: Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!
Jackie:::  Only 10,000 more tickets, and he has enough to win the Rip Hardcore Waffle Iron!
Teens:::  Waff-les!
Clyde::: I've been saving up my tickets for years trying to win that. 
Lincoln::: Sorry, Clyde.  Maybe this will make you feel better.  'Scuse me, Gus, Clyde here needs a garlic knot pick-me-up.
Gus::: Ah, sorry, Lincoln. I just served up my last order.
Leni::: OMGosh, this was totes fun. This place is great! Who knew?
Lincoln:::  We did.  Anyways, thanks for coming. Have fun at Dim Yum tomorrow! 
Fiona:::  Oooh, sorry, we weren't clear before. We meant Dim Yum is closed... forever.
Leni::: See you guys tomorrow!
Miguel:::  And you better believe your boy's getting his hands on the rest of that Rip Hardcore kitchenware line.
Lincoln:::  Don't worry, guys. I'll make them see that this is our hangout. I'll be friendly but persuasive, charming but mature, casual but firm.
Lincoln::: Please, please, please, please, pleeeeease!
Leni::: I'm really sorry, Lincoln, but Gus's is the only hangout that works for all of my friends.
Lincoln::: Seriously? There's nowhere else? What about the Burpin' Burger?
Miguel::: How dare you?! I'm recently vegetarian.
Lincoln::: OK, what about the Burnt Bean?
Jackie::: I don't do hot liquids.
Lincoln::: Well, what about the-
Fiona:::  Ah, ah, ah! We could do this all day, but we're not going to. See you tomorrow.
Lincoln:::  We cannot sit by while our hangout is taken over by garlic knot-loving teenagers. We need to reclaim Gus's, our beloved home away from home. Because they may take our waffle irons, but they will not! Take! Our! FREEDOM!
Rusty::: Could you get your foot off my sandwich?
Lincoln::: Oops.  Sorry.
Stella::: Uh, Lincoln, super inspirational speech and all, but how do we get rid of Leni and her friends?
Lincoln::: Do you think I would have stomped on Rusty's lunch if I didn't have a plan?
Zach::: That oughta do it. Now all the games look off limits.
Leni:::  OMGosh! An arcade just for VIPs!
Miguel::: Girl, I only do VIP.
Lincoln::: Time for plan B. Clyde, you're up.
Clyde:::  They're gonna know it's me.
Lincoln::: That's what the disguise is for. 
Clyde::: Now I'm nervous, and I can't see.
Lincoln:::  Go get 'em, buddy.
Leni:::  Do you have any special pizzas today?
Clyde::: Uh, no. Actually we don't have any pizza at all, or pasta, or food.
Mandee::: Guess we should go, guys.
Gus:::  Hey gang, the Royal Woods Men's Choir ordered this Gus buster, but they got called away on a singing emergency. You want?
Lincoln::: Time for Plan C: Gus' famous ice bar.
Rusty::: Which ice we going with? Cubed? Shaved? Flaked? Still? Sparkling? Diet?
Lincoln::: Nope.  Pebbled. Leni hates it. She says it's like chewing baby rocks. Liam, think you can get these into her cup from over here?
Liam::: You're darn tootin' I can.
Leni:::  Ew, ugh, baby rocks! Ugh!
Gus::: Ma'am, what's wrong?
Leni::: It's that awful ice! I can still feel it in my mouth and it's stressing me out.
Gus::: Then Gus' shall provide a way to relax.  Get comfortable; you're gonna be here for a while.
Lincoln:::  Gaaaah! That's it!  Leni, we're done with you hanging out here! 
Liam::: Yeah! Now get! Don't make us hunk more ice at y'all.
Leni:::  The baby rocks was you? Not cool, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Then there's only one way to settle this... We'll have a competition to see who gets to call Gus' their hangout. Losers are banned forever.
Leni:::  Let's do it.
Lincoln::: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Gus' Game-a-thon. Here's how this works. We compete in a series of challenges. The group with the most Gus points wins.  ROUND ONE. Whoever eats the most hot wings gets a Gus point. You and me, Leni. Go!
Leni::: I'm sorry; I just can't!
Gus::: Ah! Hot sauce in my eyes!
Lincoln:::  That's the end of Round One. It's Team Lincoln, one, Team Leni, zero.  ROUND TWO.  Whoever crosses the finish line first gets a Gus point. On your marks, get set, go!
Rusty::: You aren't gonna win if you don't speed it up.
Clyde::: The skies are not a playground, Rusty.
Fiona::: How is Clyde beating you?
Miguel::: Flying is hard. Plus, I'm afraid of heights.
Leni:::  Don't worry, I got this.  There's a fashion show in Paris that you totes don't wanna miss.
Miguel::: Yeah!
Leni:::  Ooh, ooh! One Gus point for Team Leni!
Lincoln::: ROUND THREE: The claw game. Grab a prize, get a Gus point.
Mandee:::  This thing is broken!
Liam::: Told ya I was good at hoisting. I've been forklifting on the farm since before I could make like a hawk. 
Lincoln::: Gus point for Team Lincoln! The score is two to one.
Jackie::: Ha!
Lincoln:::  Two to two.
Fiona::: Yes!
Lincoln::: Three to two!
Gus::: This is really not my day.
Lincoln::: Three to three.
Lincoln::: The score is tied as we go into the final round: Dance Battle!
Gus:::  Whoa, this is really heating up.  No, I'm serious. You need to stop! My machine is about to break!
Leni::: But we don't have a winner yet!
Lincoln::: Keep dancing, everyone!
Gus::: Come on, guys!
Leni::: Is it over? Did we win?
Lincoln:::  I think we all lost.
Miguel::: You know what the worst part is?
Zach:::  All the splinters in my butt?
Miguel::: I'm still so hungry. 
Lincoln:::  Leni, I'm sorry.
Leni:::  I'm sorry, too. We shouldn't have just barged in and taken over. Gus' was your place first.
Lincoln::: Thanks, but I shouldn't have made such a big deal about you guys sharing it. Now, none of us have a place to hang out.
Gus:::  Oh, don't you worry. I know how all of you can still hang out here.
Leni::: Guys look, the booth is done.
Stella::: But who gets to sit in it?
Lincoln::: All of us. Check this out.
Liam::: Hoo-wee. It's roomier than a barn after-
Clyde::: Guess the seats still need work.
Gus:::  Wow, this place looks great. Who wants a spaghetti pizza?
Lincoln::: Thanks Gus, can we get ours to go...
