Lisa:::  SALISBURY STEAK STEALER!
Rita:::  Here's your dinner, Lincoln!
Lincoln::: Thanks, Mom. Hey, will you help me with my science project? I have to build a volcano.
Rita::: Sure, honey. Just give me five minutes. Leni and I are gonna practice putting on makeup.
Lincoln::: Hey, Dad, can you help me with my volcano?
Lynn Sr.::: Sure, son. Just give me five minutes while I give Lynn some baseball pointers.  And there's your first pointer, Lynn: never play ball in the house.
Rita::: Well, you're doing much better, Leni, but you're still venturing into...clown territory.
Lincoln::: Mom, can we work on my volcano now?
Rita::: Oh, five minutes, honey. I promised Lori I'd take a magazine quiz with her. 
Lincoln:::  But I could really use some help! Dad, can you-
Lynn Sr.:::  Five more minutes, pal. I promised Luna I'd help her lay down some funky grooves.
Lana::: Hey, Dad! I clogged the toilet so you could teach me how to fix it!
Lynn Sr.::: Five minutes, Lincoln! I mean, Lana!  Ow!
Lincoln:::  In a family as big as mine, getting attention from your parents is no easy thing.  How am I ever gonna finish this?
Lincoln::: Wow! It's finished? Your volcano is awesome, Clyde! I love how you even put people on it.
Clyde::: Thanks. That's Lori and me. We're climbing down to get married 'cause Bobby fell in, and is being devoured by lava.
Lincoln::: Ouch! It really did a number on his face. This project isn't due for a week. How'd you get it done so fast?
Clyde::: My dads helped. We spent the whole weekend working on it.
Lincoln::: My parents never give me that kind of attention. They're always rushing off to help one of my sisters.
Clyde::: Why don't you bring your volcano to my house after school? My dads will have plenty of time to help you.
Lincoln::: Really? That would be great!
Clyde::: Oh, hang on, Lincoln. I'm gonna get Volcano Lori a juice. Running from Bobby's tormented screams has made her thirsty.
Lincoln:::  Oh, these long school days, man.
Clyde::: Tell me about it. But at least we're home now.
Lincoln:::  Wow...  I always forget how different your house is from mine!
Clyde::: Uh... you're shouting, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Oh, right. Sorry. Force of habit.
Howard::: Hi, fellas. Come on in.
Lincoln::: Hi, Mr. McBride. Hi, Mr. McBride.
Harold::: Ooh, nice structure, Lincoln. Ready to get to work?
Lincoln::: You mean like now?
Harold:::  Of course.
Howard::: Oh, hang on, Lincoln. You have a loose button on your shirt.
Lincoln::: Oh. Well, I, uh...
Howard:::  No worries. 
Lincoln::: Thanks, Mr. McBride.
Harold::: Great good heavens! It looks like the sole of your shoe is about to fall off!
Lincoln::: Oh, that's just-
Harold::: No worries.  I'll just give it a little tappity tap.
Lincoln::: Wow. You're not gonna just use a stapler on that?
Howard::: Hold up, Lincoln. Your sideburns are uneven.
Lincoln::: I know. Usually, I just tilt my head.
Howard::: No worries.
Harold::: Perfect!
Howard::: Hot towel? 
Howard::: Sorry dinner's nothing fancy. Just roasted organic chicken with a homemade marinade.
Harold::: And vegetables from our garden. Help yourself, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: There's no foil to peel back?
Harold:::  Foil. L.O.L. That's a hot one, Lincoln.
Howard:::  Clyde, how was your day?
Clyde::: It was great. I lasted 37 seconds in Dodgeball.
Howard::: Did you hear that, Hare Bear? Thirty. Seven. Seconds.
Harold::: Good job, son. And Lincoln, how was your day?
Lincoln:::  What? Me? You wanna know how my day was? Now?
Choir::: HALLELUJAH!!!
Howard::: Oops. Sorry. 
Clyde::: You know the rules, Dad: no phones at the dinner table!
Lincoln::: Seriously? What about amps, or pitching machines, or toilet snakes?
Harold::: You're so funny, Lincoln!  Here. Have seconds.
Howard::: Oh. I thought I turned this off.
Howard:::  Sorry we didn't finish your volcano tonight, Lincoln. Why don't you come back tomorrow?
Harold:::  It's Mani-Pedi Night at the McBride House.
Lincoln:::  Ooh, I love Italian food!
Harold:::  You are too much, Lincoln.
Lincoln:::  I gotta say, getting some undivided attention is pretty sweet. And now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta give some undivided attention to my hammies.  Awww, yeah.
Lana::: YAHOO!
Lola::: CAR THIEF!
Lisa::: Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Lynn::: Hey, Lincoln!  You look different.
Lincoln::: My sideburns are even.
Lynn::: No, it's more than that. Your skin is glowing, you look taller, and you smell like...  ...organic Brussels sprouts? Okay, what gives?
Lincoln::: I spent tonight at Clyde's. His dads helped me with my volcano, and served me food with no foil, and asked me about my day!
Lynn::: Get out! That sounds amazing!  Hey, do you think they could help me with my baseball swing?
Lincoln::: Sure. I think Clyde said one of his dads played ball in college. Why don't you come over after school tomorrow?
Lynn::: Oh, that would be awesome! 
Lincoln::: Ow! Lynn, do you mind? Clyde's dads just gave me my vaccinations.
Harold::: Goodbye!
Howard::: Take care!
Lynn::: I just can't believe Mr. McBride spent a whole hour coaching me! And how about that dinner? What was that special thing they cooked again?
Lincoln::: Meat?
Lynn::: Yeah. It was amazing. Ah, I'd punch you, but my arm is sore from the vaccinations.
Luna::: Hey, dudes.  Wait. You look different.  Your nail beds are rockin'.  And do I smell meat?  What's going on?
Lincoln::: We've been hanging out with Clyde's dads. They've been giving us all kinds of one-on-one time.
Luna::: Rad! Hey, you think they could jam with me? Dad's got a wicked canker and he can't blow the sax anymore.
Lynn::: Sure. One of Clyde's dads told me he was in a band in college.
Lincoln:::  Okay, but this is it. If any more of you find out about Clyde's dads, the undivided attention is going to get pretty divided.
Luna:::  Don't worry, bro.  That was the car window.
Lincoln and Lynn::: Yeah, we get it.
Lincoln::: Well, this is okay. I can handle sharing with a couple of sisters. It could be worse.
Luan::: And the woodpecker said, That's why I tell knock-knock jokes. 
Lincoln:::  Luan?
Lori::: Mr. McBride, would you say I'm more an Autumn or a Winter?
Howard::: You are definitely a Summer.
Lori::: Literally, right?
Lincoln:::  Lori?!
Clyde:::  Lori? My future wife? Here with my dads?! What do I do? What do I do? Oh, I know! 
Lana::: YAHOO! MR. MCBRIDE, YO!
Lisa::: Oh, I can't believe you guys have sodium salicylate on the premises!
Leni, Lola, and Lucy::: MR. MCBRIDE! 
Howard:::  HAROLD!
Harold::: What is it, Howie?  Great Betty Buckley...
Lily:::  Poo-poo!
Howard and Harold::: THE CARPET!!!
Lily:::  Poo-poo, poo-poo...
Lincoln:::  Hey! You blabbed our secret to everyone?!
Luna::: No, bro! I would never do that! But...I may have sung it in the shower.
Luna::: Undivided attention. So good, but it can't be mentioned. One-on-one time is totally cool. Hangin' with Clyde's dads after school
Luna::: Sorry. I was just so amped.
Lucy::: Dearly beloved, we are gathered today to say goodbye-
Leni::: Guys, I can't find my bedroom!
Howard::: Remember, Leni. You're not in your own house.
Lucy:::  No talking at your own funeral.
Lincoln::: Mr. McBride, can you help me with my volcano? It's due tomorrow.
Harold:::  Sure thing, Lincoln. Just give me five minutes. Luan wants me to try out this pie.
Lincoln::: Hey, Mr. McB, wanna help me with my volcano?
Howard:::  Absolutely. Uh, just give me five minutes while I help Lola with her double pageant wave.
Harold:::  So, that's what she meant by 'try out this pie'.  Just give me five more minutes, Lincoln. Gotta get this meringue out of my eye.
Howard:::  Quiz Lori, jam with Luna, find Lily...
Harold:::  There we go. Now, who was it that needed my help?  Lisa! 
Lincoln::: This stinks, Clyde. I finally get some attention and my sisters come over here and hog it. They all gotta go.
Clyde::: I totally agree. Except for Lori.  I'm studying all her quiz answers, and if I change everything about myself, we'll be soulmates!
Lincoln::: You know, if you wanna impress Lori, you can just talk to her.
Clyde::: Yes. Talk to her. That's a valid- 
Lincoln:::  I've had just about enough of this.  Now listen up!  I guess I picked the wrong day to stop shouting.  I SAID-
Lola:::  Thank you, Lincoln! I got it! I am going to dominate the Little Miss Ambidextrous Pageant!
Leni:::  You're the best, Lincoln. Clyde's dads really helped with my makeup. Now if I can just find my bedroom.  Nope. That's Lisa's room.
Lana:::  Lincoln, did you know Mr. McBride put himself through theater school working as a plumber? He spent a whole hour teaching me about flush valves!
Lincoln:::  Wow. Maybe I had it wrong. My sisters aren't trying to hog Clyde's dads. They just want a little attention, too. And you know what? I'm gonna let them have it.  But not this leftover meat. That's coming with me. 
Rita::: Oh, Lincoln. There you are. I got some more materials for your volcano.
Lynn Sr.:::  And I made my special marinara sauce for lava.
Lincoln:::  Wow! Thanks! You guys remembered my volcano!
Lynn Sr.::: Of course we did. We always planned to help. We just needed to find some time.
Rita::: We're sorry it took so long, honey. Did you do something to your sideburns?
Lynn::: We broke Clyde's dads.
Rita::: You did what?
Lori::: We were having a great time when all of a sudden they just snapped, herded us into their car and drove us home.
Lisa::: I have no idea what precipitated this. I simply suggested a sleepover.
Lincoln:::  Not everyone can handle 11 kids like Mom and Dad can.
Clyde::: Hey, Dad, what did you think of my future bride, Lori?
Howard:::  Which one was she? There were so many... 
Harold:::  I'm sorry. Frozen dinners were all I could manage.
Clyde::: Dad, I think you forgot to- 
Lincoln:::  I guess I really underestimated my parents. Even if it takes a while, they eventually find time for all of us, every day. No wonder Dad has a wicked canker.
Lynn Sr. and Rita::: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Five minutes, girls.  We're helping Lincoln now.
Lincoln::: It's finished! Ahem. Drum roll, please.  Three...two...one!
