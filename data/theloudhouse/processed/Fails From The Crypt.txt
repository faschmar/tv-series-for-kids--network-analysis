Ronnie Anne:::  Uh, can I just get to the door?
Hector::: Sergio tells us you're camping in Great Lakes City Cemetary tonight.
Rosa::: Mis bebes? At a cemetary? At night?! Nunca!
Hector::: Much too scary for kids.
Sergio::: *Bawk!* Even for me!
Ronnie Anne::: Well, that's the point. Legend has it forty years ago, a group known as the Fearless Four spent the entire night in the cemetary. No one's been brave enough to do it since. Until tonight.
Ronnie Anne::: And Mom gave me permission.
Rosa::: Well, I'm her mom and I didn't give her permission to give you permission.
Maria::: Oh, come on, Mama. You let Carlos and me go when we were kids.
Carlos:::  Heh! Maybe you'll make it longer than we did. Maria couldn't last an hour.
Maria::: Oh -- Me? You wanted to leave.
Carlos::: Daw -- guuuuh, pretty sure that was you.
Maria:::  I really don't think so.
Maria::: You gonna cwy, huh?! Gonna cry, widdle baby boy?
Carlos::: MOM!!
Rosa::: Aye...
Ronnie Anne::: Ugh. Come on! You let them go.  Please? Por favor?
Ronnie Anne::: Pwease?
Hector:::  Oh, no! She's using her puppy dog eyes!
Hector::: Must... look away!  Can't... resist!  Okay, mija, fine... you can go.
Ronnie Anne::: Thank you, thank you!  Gracias!
Sergio::: You're a weak man.
Ronnie Anne::: Everyone ready to brave the haunted cemetery? 
Casey::: Yup! I brought my dad's night vision goggles.
Sameer:::  I brought two pairs of underwear.
Nikki::: Got my spell book to ward off gnarly spirits.
Laird::: And I brought my security blanket! I'm fearless with this thing.
Sid::: Come here, Gail!  My mom's taking care of Gail. She said he can keep watch for us all night.
Sid::: One hoot means the coat is clear; no ghosts, zombies or werewolves.
Laird::: What does two hoots mean?
Sid:::  RUN.
Ronnie Anne:::  See? This isn't so scary.
Laird::: Y-yeah!  Maybe I don't even need this.
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, come on, Laird. It's just the wind.
Ghoulish Voice::: Oooooh~! You better leave~!
Laird::: The wind is suddenly very articulate...
Casey::: M..maybe someone should check it out.
Kids::: DIBS NOT!
Casey::: DIBS NOT!... Gah...  Did I say, uh... check it out? I was kidding! C'mon, you know I like to joke! People are always calling me 'Casey the Kidder'! Heh heh... heh...  Ugh... Fine, I'll go.  Aw well. At least I have these night-vision goggles.  Anyone out here? AAAAAH!!  Oh... Ha ha. Nice try, guys.  AAAAAH!! This isn't funny...  Uuhhh... Aren't skeletons supposed to be in the ground?  And they're definitely not supposed to be WALKING!!
Nikki::: Did you hear that? It was Casey!
Laird::: Maybe something got him!
Ronnie Anne::: Or he's just trying to scare us. He said people call him Casey the Kidder.
Sameer::: No one calls him that.
Sid::: Someone should go look for him!
All:::  DIBS NOT! 
Nikki::: Ugh, it's a tie! What do we do now?
Laird::: Uh, none of us go?  Huh?
Ronnie Anne::: CASEY!
Sid::: Where are you?
Nikki::: It's us!
Laird::: Come on out, Casey!
Sameer:::  Look! 
Ronnie Anne::: Casey's goggles! 
Sameer::: This is bad!
Nikki:::  Sorry. I giggle when I'm nervous.
Sid::: “Hmm… If I were running for my life, which way would I go?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Maybe we should…”
Sameer::: “Don't say it.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Split up.”
Sameer::: “Ronnie Anne! I said don't say it.”
Nikki:::  “We're doomed.”
Sameer::: “Casey!”
Nikki::: “Bro!”  “Wait, it's cool, I have a spell for this.”  “Half a cup of butter. Porcini mushrooms.”  “This is my mom's cookbook.”
Sameer::: “I'm gonna need more underwear!”
Laird::: “Why am I here? I don't care about breaking records. I care about normal things, like making my bed, scrapbooking and doing the Sunday crossword with Grandpa Mervin.”
Sid::: “It's OK, Laird, it's just fog. Plus, Gail is looking out for…”
Laird::: “You heard the bird! Run!”
Ronnie Anne::: “Laird! Wait!”
Sid::: “Maybe we should go too.”
Ronnie Anne::: “We can't go. We have to find the others and make history.”
Sid::: “Can we make history for the shortest time here?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Done!”
Hector::: “They're all gone.”  “Adiosito.”
Rosa::: “We did it! Our record is safe! Forty years and going strong. Now we can eat.”
Vito::: “No one dethrones the fearless four!”
Hector::: “How was your, uh, night in the cemetery, muchachas?”
Sergio:::  “Did you, um, make history?”
Ronnie Anne::: “No, it might have been the scariest night of my life.”
Sid::: “I may never sleep again.”
Ronnie Anne::: “You were right, it was too scary okay.”
Sid::: “We didn;t even make it until midnight.”
Sergio::: “Tell me about it.”
Carlos::: “It's okay, Ronnie Anne, at least you lasted longer than your mom.”
Sid::: “Anyway, tonight is gonne be different.”
Rosa, Hector & Sergio::: “Wait, what?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Yeah, we're all going back to try again.”
Rosa, Hector & Sergio::: “Wait, what?”
Maria::: “Come, mija, we can help you two pack up.”
Rosa::: “These kids are tougher than we thought. Andale, let's get ready for round two. And make it even scarier.”
Sergio:::  “Hope they pack their chonies.”
Vito::: “Hey, what are we's laughing about?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Everyone got their safety gear?”
Sid::: “Gail's ready.”
Casey::: “Goggle's on.”
Nikki::: “Spell book, check.”
Sameer::: “Extra undies.” 
Laird::: “And I'm wearing diapers.”
Sid::: “Even Gail brought his own safety blanket.”
Laird::: “I knew we had a connection.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Remember, we stick together and we're not leaving for anything tonight.”
Hector::: “Okay, Vito, time to start howling.”
Vito::: “Hey, oh, that's my line.”
Hector::: “Wasn't me.”
Rosa::: “Aye, it's just the wind. Come on, Vito.”
Hector::: “Aye, madrecita.”
Vito::: “Ah, what's that!”  “Hold me!”
Hector::: “Vito, calm down. There's nothing to be afraid of.”
Sergio:::  “Except that guy!”
Hector::: “Run!”
Vito::: “Forget this place.”
Rosa:::  “Comares! We can't just leave!”  “We have to save the children.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Abuela?!”
Hector::: “Come on Mija! We have to run!”
Ronnie Anne::: “What are you all doing here?! What's going on?!”
Rosa::: “We'll explain later. Hurry, the cemetery is alive!”
Sameer::: “Oh man!”  ”There's not enough underwear in the world for this!”
Nikki:::  “I definitely got the spellbook this time.”  “The mitochondria is the powerhouse of a cell.”  “That's my science book!”
Vito::: “Ooh! Hey! Help! Who turned out the lights?!”  “My bombito.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Quick, let's hide in this crypt.”  “I think we're safe in here.”
Hector::: “No, we're not.” [Pushes everyone out “Move! ¡Ándale! ¡Ándale!”
Rosa::: “Take us! Not the niños!”
Sergio:::  “Speak for yourself!”
Hector::: “What's wrong with you kids? How can you laugh right now?”
Maria::: “Because payback is sweet.”
Everyone Except Laird::: “We got you!”
Rosa::: “Que? What's going on here?”
Ronnie Anne::: “We know it was you scaring us, we figured it out last night.”  “Mom, it was so scary. There was a skeleton and a zombie and a spider!”
Maria::: “It's okay, mija.”  “Wait... Carlos, isn't that what scared us when we were kids?”
Carlos::: “It is.”
Sid:::  “It was so scary, I'm not gonna sleep for weeks.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Sid, where'd you get that tamale?”
Sid::: “The spider dropped it.”
Hector::: “Rosa, your tamales gave us away.”
Rosa::: “You weren't complaining when you were stuffing your face.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Anyway, we realized it was you who scared us.”
Carlos::: “And us. I mean, uh, Maira.”
Maria::: “Oh you wish.”
Ronnie Anne::: “So my friends and I teamed up with Mom and Tío Carlos to get you guys back.”
Laird::: “We did?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Laird, I thought you knew?”
Laird::: “No! No one tells me anything! I've been genuinely terrified all night.”
Sid::: “Gail, you were supposed to tell him.”  “He says, my bad.”
Rosa::: “It's true, we didn't want our record broken.”
Hector::: “Maybe we were being too competitive. But you got us good kids.”
Carlos::: “And grown ups.”
Hector:::  “Yeah, good job son.”
Sergio:::  “I wasn't scared.”  “Mommy!” 
Rosa::: “Aye, it's late, let's go home.”
Ronnie Anne::: “You mean early, look, we made it all night.”
Hector::: “And we did it together.”
Maria:::  “That's the only way Carlos could have done it.”
Rosa::: “Now all three generations have made it into the history books.”
Hector::: “The fearless four become the fearless twelve.”
Vito::: “How'd I get over here?”
