Maria::: Okay, I'm headed to work.
Ronnie Anne::: Hang in there, Mom! Eight more hours and you're off for a week!
Maria::: I know. I can't wait for a week of no boils, bunions, or blisters.
Bobby::: Oh, Mom! I'm eating.
Sergio:::  “Give back those crackers! That's my snack.”  “Nice job biscuit breath.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Hey, Mom's high school yearbook.”
Bobby::: “Mom's in high school?”
Ronnie Anne:::  “She was, like a jillion years ago. Woah, check out Mom's hair.”  “It says here she was voted... Most likely to see the world.”
Bobby::: “But Mom's never gone overseas.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Here she is in the Italian Club.”
Bobby::: “And the East Asian Culture Club.”
Ronnie Anne::: “And the Young Explorers Club.”  “Bobby, when Mom was younger she wanted to travel.”  “I wonder why she never did. Maybe Abuela knows.”
Sergio::: “Hey! That's private!”
Rosa::: “Yes, your mother wanted to see the world, but once you beautiful bebés came into her life she put her travel plans aside.”  “Raising a family takes a lot of work you know.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Mom never travelled because of us.”  “Hey, Mom has that week of vacation coming up, maybe we can make it up to her by sending her on a trip.”
Bobby::: “That's a great idea.”  “Where can we send her for…”  “Twelve bucks,”  “a button, and a cat toy?”
Ronnie Anne::: “No. This'll cost a lot of money, but I know a way we can win her a free trip.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Check out Mr. Hong's new promotion… A prize wheel. And the grand prize is a trip to Korea.”  “Two packs of gum, please.”
Mr. Hong::: “That's good for two spins.”

Mr. Hong:::  “Congrats! You won the latest PX-5000 fridge. It makes two kinds of ice. Crushed and whole.”

Mr. Hong::: “Oh, congrats, you won a huge tuna.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Hey, look. If we eat this super colossal pizza, we'll win a trip to Italy.”

Ronnie Anne::: “Woah, they weren't kidding when they said colossal.”
Bobby::: “Come on, we have to do it for Mom.”
Pizza Chief::: Belíssimo, Hey you won the prize  “Here's your pizza.”

Bobby & Ronnie Anne::: “Dance marathon?”
Mrs. Kernicky::: “You betcha! The last couple still dancing wins a trip around the world. Mr. Scully and I have been practicing all week. Oh, speaking of which, I better go grab him.”
Ronnie Anne:::  “A trip around the world? That's perfect. We have to enter.”
Bobby::: “We should ask Tía Frida to enter too, she can dance for hours.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Maybe we should get the whole family to dance. That'll increase our chances of winning.”
Carl:::  “I can't wait to see Tía Maria's face when I win her the trip.”
CJ::: “You mean when I win her the trip.”
Frida::: “Boys, you're partners, you can't win without each other.”
Carlota::: “Save your energy guys, we might be here for a while.”
Mrs. Galiano::: “Are you ready to dance?”  “Just a reminder of the rules… If you or your partner stop dancing...”  “You're out! The music will play until there's only one couple left.”  “Even if it takes all night. Now, who's ready to win a trip around the world?”
Hector::: “I'm getting a little hungry.”
Rosa:::  “I came to win.”
Mrs. Galiano::: “On your marks… get set… Dance!”
Frida::: “Carlos, you're going so slowly.”
Carlos::: “I'm pacing us for success.”

Maria::: “What a shift. My vacation could not come at a better time.”  “What happened? You look like you all just ran a marathon.”
CJ::: “More like danced a marathon.”
Maria:::  “I just miss everything, don't I?”  “Ronnie Anne your feet are swollen, you should be elevating them.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Mom, no, I'm fine.”
Maria::: “You are not fine.”  “In fact, you all look pretty beat up.”
Carl::: “I hurt Tía.”
CJ::: “I hurt more.”
Maria:::  “Okay, ice pack, ice pack, heat pack, bandage.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Mom, stop. We can't keep ruining things for you all the time.”
Maria:::  “What are you talking about.”
Ronnie Anne::: “We found your old yearbook and that you always wanted to travel. But you never got to, because of us.”
Bobby::: “So we entered a dance marathon to win you a trip around the world. But we lost.”
Maria:::  “That's incredibly sweet of you. But, I don't mind at all that I never got to travel. Raising you two has been the journey of a lifetime.”
Frida::: “It's so beautiful!”
Maria::: “Sure, I wanna eat pizza in Italy, and see sumo wrestlers in Japan. But, it'll mean so much more when I get to do it with you two.”
Ronnie Anne:::  “Wait, did you say sumo? I think there's a way you can see the world with us today. Grab your passport.”
Carl::: “This is where I live now.”
Ronnie Anne::: “A walk around our block is basically a trip around the world. First stop… Korea.”
