Lincoln::: Hey, Frank.
Classmate::: Frank! Over here, buddy!
Clyde::: He's so cool!
Mrs. Johnson::: Now, before we pack up, I need a volunteer to look after Frank this weekend while I'm out of town.
Lincoln::: Come on, please, Mrs. Johnson! Me! Me!
Mrs. Johnson::: Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Yes!
Clyde::: Way to go, Lincoln!
Mrs. Johnson::: Now, Lincoln, this is a major responsibility. Frank needs to be fed twice a day; and under no circumstances should he be let out of his cage. Unlike me this weekend.
Lincoln::: Well, see ya Monday, Mrs. Johnson. 
Lincoln::: This is gonna be the best weekend ever!
Clyde::: I'm not sure your sister Leni will think so. Remember last Halloween?
Leni:::  I got it! 
Clyde::: Trick or tre-
Leni::: AAAHH!!! SPIDER!!!
Clyde::: I'm all right...
Clyde::: She hid in her room for three weeks.
Lincoln::: If I had to worry about my sisters every time I wanted to do something, I'd never do anything.  Besides, I have a plan. Stealth mode.
Clyde::: Now I'm worried.
Leni::: SPIDER!!!  GET IT AWAY! GET IT AWAY!
Luan::: Aw, come on. It's fake.
Lincoln::: Ssh...
Lincoln::: There you go, buddy.
Lana::: Can I borrow the big kid scissors?  Hey, what's that?  Oh-ho! He's so creepy!  Can I play with him? Can I?
Lincoln::: No, no.  Frank stays in the cage.
Lana::: Aw...
Lola::: Lana, give me back my dolly!  He's so adorable!
Twins::: Has Leni seen this?
Lincoln::: No. And we want to keep it that way, don't we?-- So, shh.
Lisa::: Excuse me, some of us are trying to solve for Y.  Ooh! Is that an Aphonopelma chalcodes?
Lincoln::: Uh...it's a tarantula. My class calls him Frank.
Lisa:::  Fascinating specimen. Has Leni seen this?
Lincoln:::  No! That's why I'm trying to keep him a...
Lincoln::: ...secret.
Luna::: Has Leni seen it?
Lincoln:::  Guys, for the last time! Leni's not gonna see--
Leni::: See what?
Siblings:::  NOTHING!
Leni::: Oh, my gosh! Are you planning a surprise party for me?! Wait! Don't tell me. I wanna be surprised. 
Lori:::  That was close. You'd better know what you're doing, Lincoln. 
Lincoln::: Hey, you look a little sluggish, buddy. Bet you'd really like to get out and stretch your legs. I guess a few minutes wouldn't hurt.  Now, where did I put those crickets?  Maybe this'll cheer you up.  Frank? Where'd you go? Frank, come out! This isn't funny!  Crud...  Where are you, Frank? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? 
Twins::: Where's who?
Lincoln:::  There you are! The two cutest twins in town! Found 'em! See ya! 
Lola::: He was talking about me.
Lana::: I sure hope so.
Lisa::: What in Schr√∂dinger's Cat?!
Lincoln::: Sorry, Lis! I'll clean it up later.
Lincoln::: Lynn! Freeze!
Lynn:::  We're playing Freeze Tag? Cool!
Lincoln::: Ow!
Luna::: Dude!
Lincoln::: Really dig what you're laying down there, sis!  Gotcha!
Luan:::  What are you doing with my fake spider?
Lincoln::: Fake? Oh, nothing.  Here. And here's your fake dog poop.
Luan::: I don't have any fake dog poop.  Just kidding!
Lincoln::: Where are you. Where are you? Where are you? 
Lori:::  What are you doing, you weirdo?!
Lincoln::: I'm...uh...looking for my contact lens! Oh! There it is!  That's better. 
Lynn:::  Can I unfreeze now?
Lincoln:::  Crud, crud, crud!
Lori::: Alright, Lincoln! You don't wear contacts! What is going on?
Luna::: You've been acting even weirder than usual, bro.
Lola::: Yeah. There's no way you think Lana is cute.
Lincoln::: Okay, I'll tell you! Well, Frank was looking sluggish, so I took him out of his cage to get a little exercise, and then I turned to get the crickets, and he was gone.
Leni::: What are we whispering about? Oh right! My surprise party! Don't worry. I won't tell me!
Leni::: See? I know nothing. Just making a smoothie. 
Sisters:::  Where did he go? Where? Where's the spider?
 Lola::: What are we gonna do? 
Leni::: Oh, I need milk. 
Lisa:::  Wait!  You're lactose intolerant!
Leni::: No, I'm not.  I'm tolerant of everyone, whether they lack toes or not. 
Siblings::: NOOOO!!!  Huh? 
Lily::: Eee, pider!
Leni::: So, who wants to try my new recipe? It's curds and...  ...way, way too much spinach.  Ugh! I know! What was I thinking?
Leni:::  Ha! Nice try, Luan, but I'm not falling for another one of your fake spiders.  Though, this one looks pretty real.
Leni::: AAAHH!!! SPIDER!!! 
Siblings::: NOOOO!!!
Leni:::  WORST SURPRISE PARTY EVER!!!
Lincoln:::  Frank! No-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Lucy::: I just wanna say I'm sorry for your loss... and that I'd be honored to serve as funeral director.  I keep an assortment of caskets on hand. Were you thinking shoebox, or for a little more money, mahogany?
Clyde::: Hey, Lincoln. I brought you this casserole. My nana says that there's no greater comfort in times of grief.
Lincoln::: Thanks.  This might as well be my funeral, too. Our whole class is gonna hate me for letting this happen to Frank.
Lucy::: We are gathered here to mourn the untimely passing of Frank the Tarantula, a pet beloved by all.
Lola:::  Except Leni!
Lana:::  The murderer!
Lori::: Yeah! This is all Leni's fault!
Lincoln::: Guys, this isn't Leni's fault. It's mine.
Leni::: Ew! Ew! Ew! 
Lincoln::: I knew Leni was afraid of spiders, but I brought Frank home, anyway. It was a bad idea. I guess I deserve to have my whole class hate me.
Lola::: Ew! Gross, Cliff! Show some respect!
Lana:::  Whoa, weird! This hairball looks like Frank!
Lola::: Ew! Gross, Lana! Show some respect!
Lincoln::: Because this isn't Frank! It's a hairball, too! Which means...  Frank could still be alive!
Lynn Sr.:::  AAAHH! SPIDER!
Lincoln::: And it sounds like Leni just found him!
Clyde::: Uh, that wasn't Leni. I know that scream.
Clyde:::  Oh, hi, Mr. Loud. Trick or tre-
Lynn Sr.::: AAAHH!!! SPIDER!!! 
Clyde::: I'm all right.
Luna:::  Dad's afraid of spiders?
Lori:::  And it looks like he's got the exterminator on speed dial!
Kids::: Frank!
Exterminator::: Oh, hello, cute little caterpillar family. 
Lincoln::: It's okay, sir. There's been a misunderstanding. You don't need to kill the spider.
Exterminator::: Huh. What are you, a spider hugger?  Nobody stops me from getting my spider... 
Lincoln::: I gotta go save Frank!
Lynn:::  We can help!
Clyde::: I can help, too!
Lincoln:::  Okay. You guys distract the exterminator while I look for Frank.
Lincoln::: Unfreeze.
Luna:::  There's a big scary spider in the last room on the right! I hope someone can exterminate this ugly spider!
Luan:::  What's the matter? Afraid of a little rubber spider? 
Exterminator::: I ain't afraid of nothin'.
Lucy::: Excuse me.  The scary spider went in there. 
Exterminator:::  Hmm... 
Lori:::  What are you doing, you weirdo?!
Exterminator:::  Oh, well, uh... I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I didn't...
Clyde::: Roar! I'm a spider. Come and get me!  I'm all right.
Lisa::: Kids. They can be so juvenile. Mouthwash?  My special ghost pepper formula. The tingle means it's working.
Lincoln::: Frank's not downstairs. So, he must be...
Exterminator::: Upstairs...
Exterminator::: Ha! I've got you now!
Lincoln:::  WAIT! STOP! NOOO!!!
Lincoln::: Huh?
Exterminator::: WHA?!
Lincoln:::  FRANK!
 Luan::: Yes, Frank!
 Lynn Jr.::: Woohoo!
Exterminator:::  Why you...
Leni:::  Hold it right there, mister! If you exterminate this spider, you'll exterminate...  ...this boy's future!  Everyone will think he's a spider killer,  and no one will ever trust him again! Do you really want that on your conscience?!
Exterminator:::  Wow...I never thought of it that way. Lady, you just changed my life.
Lincoln & Leni::: Really?
Exterminator:::  Of course not, you spider huggers! Exterminator out! Here's my bill. 
Lincoln::: Leni! That was amazing! But why?
Leni::: I heard what you said at the funeral. And besides, maybe spiders aren't so bad after all. I mean, this one's kinda cute.  No, it's not! Take it! Take it!  Ew ew ew ew ew ew! It blinked at me!
Lincoln::: Let's get you back in your cage, Frank.
Lisa::: I always thought Frank was a strange name for a female spider.
Lincoln::: Frank's a girl?
Lisa::: Mm-hmm. I can tell from the markings. Plus, female spiders always get sluggish before they give birth.
Clyde::: Frank's gonna be a mommy?
Sisters::: Aw...
Lincoln::: I'll miss you, Frank, but I'm glad things are gonna be back to normal around here.
Leni::: 20...21...22...23...
Leni:::  AAAAAAAHHHHH!!! SPIDERS!!!
