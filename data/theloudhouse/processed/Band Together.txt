Luna::: “We are the moon goats! Thank you Burnt Bean!”
Scoots::: “Yeah! Goat head for life! Check out my tattoo.”
The Moon Goats:::  “We believe you!”
Chunk:::  “Boy, wicked show, mates.”
Mazzy::: “Yeah, Sully, you destroyed those keys.”
Sam::: “You can still see the marks on his forehead.”
Sully:::  “Ow.”
Luna::: “Let's go grab some grub. Chunk, you coming?”
Chunk::: “Love to mate, but I got another gig.”  “Testing, testing, one, two, three.”
Scoots::: “Bingo!”
Chunk::: “No, love, we haven't started yet.”
Luna::: “Sam, hurry and put your bass away so we can go.”
Sam:::  “Alright, alright.”
Luna, Sully & Mazzy::: “Band pranked!”
Sam:::  “Okay, you got me.”
Sully::: “Glad it wasn't me this time.”
Mr. Grouse:::  “Lucky you.”
Luna::: “Dudes, I can't wait for us to be touring the world and rocking sold-out stadiums.”
Lynn Sr.:::  “Just don't forget all your adoring fans back home. I assume you want the usual; Moon Goat cheese fries…”
Everyone::: “Easy on the moon, hold the goats.”
Lynn Sr.::: “Be right…”  “Get it? Cause it sounds like a goat.” 
Luna::: “Alright dudes, game time. Guess the rockstar, I'll go first.” 
Sam, Sully & Mazzy::: “Mick Swagger.”
Luna::: “I didn't even start yet.”
Sam, Sully & Mazzy::: “It's always Mick Swagger.”
Katie::: “Hi, I'm picking up a to-go order. Katie Crest.”
Luna::: “Guys, she's the biggest manager in the music biz. I'm gonna see what she's doing in town.”
Kotaro::: “So, are you new to Royal Woods?”
Katie::: “No, just in town a couple of days. Launching a summer rock tour.”
Kotaro::: “Cool, here's your Lynnsange to-go.”  “And should your tour ever need a little more cowbell…”
Katie:::  “The Clang?”
Kotaro::: “Cause that's the sound a cowbell makes.”
Katie:::  Oh, yup, git it. Did you put extra Parmesan in the bag?”
Luna:::  “Guys! This could be our big break. If we can get Katie to hear us rock, she might agree to be our manager. You in?”
Sam::: “We're here to see Katie Crest.”
Front Desk Clerk:::  Okay, no. Ms. Crest said absolutely no visitors. Especially musicians!
Room Service Attendant::: Taking this food order to Ms. Crest's suite. Could you check the room number for me?
Front Desk Clerk:::  Give me one second here. Room 237.
Room Service Attendant::: On my way! 
Front Desk Clerk::: Wait, did I say Room 232 or 237? 
Room Service Attendant::: Room service!
Luna::: Hey Katie, we're the Moon-
Flip::: Well, don't just stand there gawking. Grab a strip and start rippin'!  Holy nachos!
Katie:::  Where's that room service? Should've been here by now...
Luna::: We're the Moon Goats! And we're your next new band!
Katie::: I'm not looking for any new bands. 
Luna::: We don't give up that easy.
Katie::: No! 
Mr. Grouse:::  This is not my day...
Katie::: Gah!
Luna::: Dude!  
Katie::: “You ever have that feeling a bunch of kids are following you?”
Lynn Sr.::: “Every moment of every day.”
Luna::: “Now!”  “Let us play one song for you and I promise we'll leave you alone.”
Katie:::  “Fine.”
Luna::: “Yes! Alright, one… two… three… four...”
Katie::: “Stop, stop. I've heard enough.”  “That was… phenomenal, I mean I… had my doubts but I was clearly wrong, you've got some serious star appeal, the look, the vibe. I'd love to manage you.
Lynn Sr.:::  “Congrats, kids.”  “I'm so ding-dang happy for all of you.”
Katie::: “All?”  “No, just her.” 
Luna::: “Wait, what? Why only me?”
Katie::: “The lead singer in one of my bands just dropped out of the tour. Her cat became an influencer. You'd be the perfect replacement. What do you say?”
Sam, Sully & Mazzy:::  “No!”
Luna:::  “Yes!”
Katie::: “The tour leaves at the end of this week, I need an answer.”
Luna::: “Umm… Can you just give us one sec?”  “Moon Goats conference in the kitchen.”
Lynn Sr.:::  “How 'bout a little hold music?”
Katie::: “I have your card.”
Sam::: “Are you seriously going to say yes?”
Mazzy::: “The Moon Goats were supposed to make it big together.”
Kotaro::: “I'm gonna give you guys some space. Would you mind just stirring the chilli?”
Luna:::  “Look, I hate leaving the band too. But, I can't pass up this chance. I would support you guys if you got your big break, and I'm really bummed you're not supporting me.”
Sam:::  “Okay, if that's what you want.”
Luna::: “Sorry, it is. I need to go tell Katie.”
Sully::: “Needs some heat.”
Luna::: “Whoa! Look at all these gold records.”  “Woo! Who's ready to jam?!”
Katie::: “Luna, sweetheart, let me introduce you to your new bandmates. This is Reg, Bonnie…”
Reg:::  “Yo.”
Bonnie:::  “Yeah, sorry. What were you saying?”
Katie::: “And Jolly Jim.”
Luna::: “A pleasure dudes. I brought a little something to share.”  “My dad's famous Moon Go-”  “I mean, just cheese fries.”
Reg::: “I'm lactose intolerant.”
Luna::: “Sorry, I'll remember that.” 
Bonnie::: “Yeah, I don't eat carbs.”
Luna::: “Okay, noted. Jolly Jim?” 
Reg::: “Wait, the smell of cheese makes him-”
Katie::: “Enough chit chat, time to rehearse.”
Katie::: “Alright, let's try a run through.”
Katie:::  “Luna, we don't improv choreography.”
Reg::: “We're professionals.”
Luna:::  “I guess I got carried away.”
Katie::: “Great rehearsal everyone.”
Luna::: “Band pranked!”
Katie:::  “Ugh! Nice going, now you really upset Jim.”
Luna::: “Cheers to our last meal in town before the tour.”  “Dudes, wanna play 'Guess the rockstar'? Okay great, I'll go first.”
Katie:::  “Come here.”
Mr. Grouse:::  “Not today ya bozos.”
Luna::: “I'm so sorry! I was just trying to have some fun. Like I did with my old band.”
Katie::: “Look, Sweetie, you're not with the Moon Goats anymore. It's time to get serious.”
Luna::: “Sorry, I had that planned before this talk.”
Katie::: “Well, Luna, today is the beginning of a new rockstar life for you. Adoring fans, sold-out stadiums, a different city every night.”
Luna::: “I can't do this.”
Katie::: “Are you serious! We're loading the bus right now! Don't tell me your cat got famous too.”
Luna::: “No, look, I'm super grateful for the opportunity. But, I don't wanna do this without my friends, I'm meant to rock with them.”  “I'm so sorry.”
Katie::: “I know Jim, I'm just as shocked as you are.”
Luna::: Dudes! I told Katie I'm not going on tour! I'm back with the Moon Goats!  Why are you all making that face?
Chunk:::  Oh, hello, Luna, love.
Luna::: Oh. You replaced me.
Sam::: Luna, what were we supposed to do? You left us.
Luna:::  Yeah. No, no, no. I mean, sure. That's cool. I totally get it.
Chunk:::  Oi, I just remembered I have to hit the loo.
Luna::: No, Chunk, stay! It's all good. You're going to love being a Moon Goat, trust me. Dudes, I never should have left you. I'm so sorry.  Hey, I just thought of something. You guys probably need a new roadie now, right?
Sam::: Would you really want to do that?
Luna::: For sure! All I care about is being with you guys. Even if I have to fetch you sodas or clean up glitter bombs.
Suly & Mazzy::: You're hired.
Sam::: You're hired.
Chunk:::  You're a right mate, you are, Luna, but I can't believe you gave up the tour! Always dreamed of doing that. Adoring fans, sold out stadiums, different city every night...
Chunk::: Thank you, Burnt Bean! Good night! Stick around, Bingo is coming up next.
Luna:::  Oh, yeah! So what do you think?
Katie:::  Chunk, welcome to the rockstar life. You're not a glitter guy, are you?
Sam::: Looks like we have an opening for a lead singer.
Mazzy::: How about we give our new roadie a promotion?
Sully::: Works for me.
Luna::: You won't regret it. I missed you guys.
Moon Goats::: Moon Goats for life!
Scoots::: Hey, losers! I'm four espressos deep and I'm ready to mosh!
Mr. Grouse:::  Dang it!  Nice tattoo, Scoots.
