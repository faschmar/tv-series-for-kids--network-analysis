Lynn Sr.::: What's that smell?
Leni::: Oh, I just put on a fresh coat.
Lucy::: I have a few things decomposing.
Lynn::: Ah, just airing out the dogs!
Lynn Sr.::: Um, okay... well, it’s not Leni’s nails, or rotting flesh,  it’s definitely not feet. This smell is...  divine. Huh?
Lynn Sr.::: Luana Banana, it’s you?
Luan:::  Oh, hey Dad.
Lynn Sr.::: Is that a Monte Cristo sandwich? On brioche?
Luan:::  Aww, I messed it up.  It’s supposed to be on bread. 
Lynn Sr::: No, brioche is bread. It’s French!  Hey, what’s the occasion?  Wait, this isn’t a trick sandwich, is it?
Luan:::  No, we picked electives in school, and I got locked out of my top two choices.  Advanced Punning, and To Hee Hee or not to Hee Hee, the Philosophical Joke in You. And now I’m stuck taking Intro to Cooking, and I can’t imagine a more boring class.
Lynn Sr.:::  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And I can’t imagine a more delicious sandwich! Luan, you have some real talent!
Luan:::  Really? I don’t know much about food. Comedy is more my bread and butter.  Get it?
Lynn Sr.:::  Good one, honey! Actually, cooking is a lot like comedy. A balance of creativity and performance. Just give me a chance to show you how much fun cooking can be! It’s always been my dream to share my passion with one of you kids!
Mr. Coconuts:::  What do you have to lose?
Luan::: I’m in!
Lynn Sr.:::  Woohoo!
Mr. Coconuts:::  Ugh! Say it, don’t spray it, pal!
Lynn Sr.::: Here we go, matching chef hats.  You gotta look good to cook good.
Mr. Coconuts::: Hey, what about me?
Lynn Sr.::: Nuh, kay, uh...  Here you go. Now, let's see that syllabus.  Ah yes, first assignment: eggs. The versatile rockstar of the food world, you can boil 'em, poach 'em, fry 'em, shirr 'em, quiche 'em, scotch 'em, benedict 'em.  And always remember, it's okay to yoke around in the kitchen.  There it is, I knew I'd get you to crack a smile.  Go ahead, give it a fry.
Luan::: So, how'd I do?
Lynn Sr.::: I've always wondered how I'd look in egg,  It's just... it's just more beautiful than I ever imagined.  Bad Charles! Stop eating my face!
Lynn Sr.::: Wow honey, impressive knife work, swift but safe.  Hold on there, a good chef always inspects her crudité platter.  It's, uh, finger food. Get it?
Luan::: Well, aren't you a fungi?
Lynn Sr.:::  That one had some dirt on it.
Luan::: Finished the lava cake.
Lynn Sr.:::  Well it's got the four Cs of a great cake; chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, and creativity.  Uh, honey, how much baking powder did you use?
Luan::: Oh, I'm not sure, you made a pun and I got distracted.  Oh-no, sorry Dad.
Lynn Sr.:::  No Luan, I lava it, happy accidents in the kitchen are part of the fun.
Lynn Sr.::: Final exam: Cooking dinner for ten or more people.
Luan:::  Oh, an entire dinner, that seems intense.
Lynn Sr.::: Intense, but fun, the best part of being a chef is bringing others joy with your food, and I've got the perfect dish.
Luan::: Pasta, clams, butter,  Geo?  Dad! We can't cook our hamster.
Lynn Sr.::: What? No, no, scram Geo.  It's my famous Lynn-guine, the first dish I ever served anyone, and now it's your turn.
Luan::: You really think I can pull it off?
Lynn Sr.::: Of course. And besides, who better to test your chops on than your own loving, supportive family.
Lola::: I'm getting hangry!
Lynn Sr.:::  Quiet down in there!  You got this kiddo.
Luan::: Okay, what you have in front of you, is Dad's famous Lynn-guine and clams. It's prepared al dente, in a beurre blanc sauce and finished with just a hint of parsley. Bon appetit.
Lynn Sr.:::  Whoo-hoo! Oo-ah, Oo-ah!
Luan:::  Whoo-hoo! Hooray!
Lynn Sr::: Oh, ya crushed it!
Luan::: Oh man. You were right Dad. Seeing those empty plates, and happy faces, is making me feel so... warm.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, honey that meant-  Oh, that might be because the oven's still on. 
Luan::: No, no, I mean it. That felt almost as good as getting a big laugh on stage. I'm kinda bummed my elective is over. I've had so much fun cooking with you Dad.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh! Well, I'm glad to hear that, 'cause the fun doesn't have to end.
Luan:::  Lynn & Luan's Table?
Lynn Sr.::: Yeah! That's right honey, I want you to carry on the Loud legacy and take over the restaurant someday.
Luan:::  What? Me? No. Who, Me?  Really?
Lynn Sr.::: Ah! I can see it now! You and me taking the restaurant world by storm. Cracking jokes and yolks, making puns and buns.
Luan::: Well, I have been having a lot of fun.
Lynn Sr.::: And there's so much more to be had.
Luan:::  Hmm, let's do it!
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, it's happening! This might be the happiest moment of my life.  Ah! Get in here you big dummy!
Luan::: Ah! Luna! I thought we made a roommate pact. I don't dip your hand in warm water while you're sleeping and you don't play your gong after ten p.m.
Luna:::  Wasn't me dude.
Luan::: Dad? What are you doing?
Luna::: Maybe he's sleep gonging. 
Lynn Sr.::: A good chef rises early to source the freshest ingredients.
Luan::: But it's-
Lynn Sr.::: Fun, right? All good practice for when you take over the restaurant. Wait 'til you meet our fish lady. You're gonna love her.
Par::: It's all about the fuzz.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh yeah, that's the good stuff Deb.  Grab a sniff of the ocean-- Luan.
Luan::: Uhh...
Lynn Sr.::: Fluffier. 
Luan:::  Uhh...
Lynn Sr.::: Frothier!
Luan:::  Uhh!
Lynn Sr.:::  FOAMIER! 
Luan:::  Alright Dad. We need to talk.
Lynn Sr.:::  Aw! We sure do. Honey, this sauce-- is amazing!  I think we found ourselves a new menu item!
Luan::: But-
Lynn Sr.::: Hang on, I gotta call my sauce guy.  Ay! Mikey Marinara, you're never gonna believe what my daughter made!
Shannon::: I've really been getting into...
Lynn Sr.::: Hey honey.
Luan:::  Dad!  What are you doing here?
Lynn Sr.:::  I brought lunch! 
Luan::: But I already have lunch.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, you can't be eating basic PB&Js. If you're gonna take over the restaurant you need to work on refining your palette.  Okay, I got Limburger cheese,  a main course of beef Bourguignon,  and don't worry, I brought dessert. It's an oldie but a goody. It's baked Alaska. Well almost.
Luan::: Mr. Coconuts, keep this between us, but, I don't wanna cook anymore. Dad's kinda taken all the fun out of it, and I don't know how to tell him that, he's just so happy. You know?  Mr. Coconuts?  Lincoln! Have you seen this funnyman?  Two feet tall, orange hair, has a real ear for punchlines.
Lincoln::: I know Mr. Coconuts, Luan, but sorry, don't know where he is.
Luan::: So, you haven't seen him, and you also have a poo-poo?
Lily:::  Mmm-hmm.
Luan::: Luna, have you seen Mr. Coconuts?
Luna::: Actually no, and if I'm being honest it's been kinda nice.
Luan:::  Lock down the house! Call the cops! File a missing persons report! Mr. Coconuts is officially MIA.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, honey relax. Mr. Coconuts is fine.  Yeah, I put him into storage.
Luan::: Huh? Wait! Why would you do that?!
Lynn Sr.::: Luan, when I decided to dedicate my life to food, I didn't touch a cowbell for months! Comedy can wait. You need to focus on cooking if you're going to take over the restaurant.
Luan:::  Dad...
Lynn Sr.:::  Of course, first, you're gonna have to attend the Culinary Institute of Michigan, but someone with your talent should breeze right through.
Luan:::  Dad...
Lynn Sr.:::  After that, it's on to an apprenticeship. Maybe you can go somewhere fun like Paris. Oh! Or Kansas City! I heard they're doing great stuff with ribs down there.
Lynn Sr.::: After that, you can take over-
Luan:::  I'M NOT TAKING OVER THE RESTAURANT!!!
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, don't give me that look. I was just helping to nurture Luan's talent.  Oh, you're right. What have I done?  I need to fix this.
Luan::: Come in, I-- guess. 
Lynn Sr.:::  I made apology apple turnovers.
Luan:::  Hmm, they're underbaked.
Lynn Sr.::: Ouch, I deserved that. But I had a long talk with my new sous chef and realized something. I kind of took the fun out of cooking by laying on the pressure a little too thick.
Luan::: You think?
Lynn Sr.::: It wasn't fair of me to force my dreams onto you, sweetie. It's just, none of you guys have ever taken an interest in my passion. I got carried away. Let's just forget about the restaurant for now.
Luan::: You were excited Dad, I get it. Apology apple turnovers accepted. Now, how about you and me tag-team a family dinner tonight?
Lynn Sr.::: I promise to be a fun guy, and not a pressure cooker. 
Luan::: I'm game. Wait, who's this wise new sous chef giving you all this great advice?
Lynn Sr.::: Meet the newest member of the Loud cooking family. 
Luan::: Awww!
Mr. Coconuts::: And, I can really dice and slice.
Lynn Sr.::: Shall we get back to having fun? I think we make a great pair. 
Luan:::  You butter believe it.
