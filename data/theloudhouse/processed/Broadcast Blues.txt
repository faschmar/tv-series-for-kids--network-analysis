Clyde:::  Thanks... for... that report... and uh, look to the meeting team at, uh...  C'mon! Be nice to me while I'm live on the air.  Oh, sure, it picked up all that.
Lincoln::: And now, here's reporter Stella Zhau with a new segment called What's in Your Locker.
Stella::: Hey, Amelia! Our Action News viewers wanna know: what's in your locker?
Amelia::: I've got...  A basketball hoop...  ...a disco ball...  Aaaaand...  A snowcone machine! 
Lincoln's classmate::: Man, my locker feels so basic!
Girl Jordan::: I didn't think anything could top what's in Bolhofner's briefcase.
Chandler:::  Hey, guys!  Check this out!
Girl Jordan::: Chandler, we're trying to watch the Action News Team.
Chandler:::  'The Action News Team.'  I'm Lincoln Lame! Everyone pay attention to me while I read the dumb news.
Amelia::: And I've saved the best for last!
Zach:::  You guys are live!
Clyde::: Sorry, viewers.-- It looks like we lost Stella.
Lincoln::: Well, Kangaroos...  ...this is Clincoln McCloud, signing off. Have a hoppy day!
Clyde::: Ugh... my neck...
Clyde:::  Those cameras are a real problem. I don't know how much more of this my neck can take.
Chandler::: Hey, guys! It's your lucky day. I'm joining your news team!
Lincoln::: ...heh...heh... oh, you're serious. Sorry, but the team's full. Plus, homeroom is MORE than enough time with you in a day.
Stella::: We gotta figure out what we're gonna do with that equipment.
Chandler::: Hey, guys! Even though you SNUBBED me before, I got a little somethin'-somethin'...  ...for your show. What can I say? The Chand-man is a giver.
Liam::: ...uh... yep. All clear; ain't full of poop this time.
Lincoln::: Wow! These cameras are high-tech!
Zach::: Our show'll look so good if we use these!
Rusty::: Yeah, and so would I. This look was made for HD.
Clyde::: How did you afford these?
Chandler::: Don't worry about it. Anyway, they're all yours. IF you let me join your news team.
Stella::: Uh, Chandler, can you excuse us?
Stella::: Guys, what are we gonna do?
Liam::: Those video cameras are neater than a self-drivin' tractor during a corn harvest.
Lincoln::: But is letting Chandler join us worth some new equipment?
Lincoln:::  Welcome to the News Team, Chandler.
Chandler::: Woo-hoo! Yes! You guys made a smart choice. Check you later. 
Lincoln::: Wow, nice.
Rusty::: Now to get rid of you once and for all.
Rusty:::  Good riddance. Thanks for NEVER making me look good.
Lincoln::: This is your Action News Team,-- with today's school news.
Lincoln::: Good morning, Kangaroos. This is Lincoln Loud, reporting for Action News. Don't adjust your screens. We're coming to you in glorious high-definition...  ...thanks to our new cameras.
Clyde::: Up first, we have a new reporter, Chandler McCann.
Clyde::: What's on the menu, Chandler?
Chandler::: Today's lunch is my personal favorite: 'Chicken in your face'.
Clyde:::  Ooh... Sounds fancy.  Uh, what's 'Chicken in your face'?
Chandler::: It's chicken... IN... YO... FACE!
Stella::: He was bad!
Zach::: Oh, that was awful.
Liam::: Yeah, what'd that chicken ever do to him?
Lincoln:::  Guys, we have to fire him.
Chandler::: Hey there, Action News Team.  Now, that was some solid reporting, am I right?
Lincoln:::  Hey, Chandler. We were all just talking, and we don't think this is--
Chandler::: Whatever you got to say, say it into these new microphones.
Lincoln's group:::  Wow.
Rusty::: Whoa.
Chandler::: And not so fast. I want a bigger role on the show. Something with more air time.  How about I do the weather?
Lincoln::: Uh, can you give us a minute?
Chandler::: Sure.
Lincoln:::  Guys, look, we all know that Chandler's the worst, but those mics will make us sound great.
Clyde::: Yeah, no more sound glitches during our snappy banter.
Zach::: Besides, there's no way he can mess up the weather.
Lincoln::: Okay, Chandler. You got it.
Chandler:::  Heh heh. Yes!
Chandler::: And now, Chandler with the weather.
Chandler::: Yo, chumps, Chandman here. Get your galoshes ready 'cause there's a huge storm coming, and you're gonna get drenched.
Chandler::: Laters. 
Zach:::  Yeah, I was wrong. He messed up the weather.
Stella:::  The 'Chandman' has to go.
Chandler::: Hey there, guys.
Lincoln:::  Hey, Chandler. We were all just talking and--
Chandler:::  Look what I got for my favorite news team...
Liam::: A satellite dish?  Wait a goat-milkin' minute. What's the catch?
Chandler::: Simple. I give you the dish, and I get my own segment.
Liam::: With that satellite, we can broadcast all over town. The whole hen-house loves local news.
Stella:::  My grandma will see me!
Rusty::: Everyone will see me! 
Clyde::: Lincoln, we'll be famous!
Zach::: Aliens could pick up the signal!
Lincoln::: Well, Chandler, we decided...
All::: You got your segment.
Chandler::: Yes! I am so going to nail it.
Chandler::: Ooh, I got to take this. Chandman out.
Rusty:::  I'll get this bad boy up to the roof.
Lincoln::: And now, via satellite, your Action News Team... with today's middle school news.
Lincoln::: Good morning, Kangaroos. To start things off today, we have a new segment from Chandler called...  'Bro in the Know'.
Chandler::: Hey guys. Chandler McCann here from 'Bro in the Know.' Did you know that I'm the Royal Woods book slam champ? Check it out.
Students:::  Hey! Aw! Aw! Watch it.  Hey!
Chandler::: ...nine, ten. Ooh, a new record!  And this is your boy, Chandler, signing off for 'Bro in the Know'.
Lincoln::: This is not good.
Stella::: ...and temperature wise, we should stay within the mid 80's, and down south it's going to be hot, hot, hot.
Lincoln:::  I sure hope Chandler doesn't do anything too 'Chandlery' today.
Stella::: Now over to you, Lincoln and Clyde.
Clyde::: Thanks, Stella. Now, uh...  Let's see what our 'Bro in the Know' is up to.
Chandler::: Yo, it's your 'Bro in the Know', and here's something you may not know. Dirk just got dumped. Come on, let's go get the deets.
Chandler::: Hey, Dirk. Why'd you get dumped?
Dirk:::  Uh, um, what?
Chandler::: Was it 'cause you walk like a penguin in those skinny jeans?
Chandler::: Yeah, like that.  This is your 'Bro in the Know' signing off.
Stella::: Okay. That's TOO FAR!
Chandler:::  Nailed it, again.
Stella::: That was terrible. In fact all of your reports have been terrible since you joined the team.
Lincoln::: But that's going to end now, Chandler, because YOU'RE FIRED!
Chandler:::  Me, fired? Oh, no, I'm crushed.  Psych!  Nice try, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm having way too much fun.  And by the way, guess what's in your lockers.  Spoiler alert: It's skunks!  Oh, one minute. Got to take this. Go for Chandman.
Lincoln:::  This is our fault. We ruined our show just for a bunch of cool stuff. 
Chandler::: Oh yeah? What kind of jewelry are you looking for?
Rusty::: Is that Chandler?
Lincoln::: I think he accidentally left his mic on.
Chandler::: I just found some cufflinks at my dad's sewage plant. They'd be perfect for your grandpa.  Oh, and remember, my dad can never find out that you bought these from me. If he does, you're toast.
Stella::: You guys, that must be how Chandler got the money for all our equipment, by selling stuff from his dad's sewage plant.
Lincoln::: I know how we can get Chandler out of the news club, for good. It's time for an Action News Team sting operation!
Chandler::: Talk to the Chandman. 
Zach:::  Yes, my girlfriend and I are looking for a necklace, and I heard that you're the guy.
Chandler::: Yeah, I've got tons of necklaces. Meet me in the alley by the sewage plant in an hour. I'll bring what I've got.
Zach::: Okay, well, that sounds just great. We'll see you in the--  oh, he hung up.
Zach::: Will you stand still? I can't clip this to your dress.
Rusty::: It's a pantsuit.
Lincoln::: Guys, focus.
Stella::: So explain to me again why I'm not playing the girlfriend.
Lincoln::: Sorry, but Rusty really nailed the audition.  Oh! Rusty, Zach, here comes Chandler!
Chandler::: Hey, I brought the stuff.  Nice pantsuit, by the way.
Rusty:::  Thanks for noticing.  Eww!
Chandler::: This will get rid of the sewer smell.
Lincoln::: You're busted, Chandler. We've recorded your secret necklace sale.
Rusty:::  And we are going to tell your dad all about your shady business...
Zach::: ...unless you quit the news club.
Chandler::: You can't tell my dad! I'll be grounded for months! And I have so many awesome parties coming up that you guys aren't invited to.  Fine, I'll quit.  But I'm taking my equipment with me. If I'm not part of the news team...  Then neither is my equipment!
Clyde:::  Great, now we definitely CAN'T do the news.
Zach::: Yeah, we trashed all our old equipment.
Stella::: Liam, you can stop recording. You don't need to document our misery.
Lincoln::: Guys, I know how we can still do our show.
Clyde::: Thanks for that sunny weather report, Stella. I told my dads I didn't need this poncho.
Lincoln::: Thanks, Clyde.  It'll be so nice to have all that sun this week.
Lincoln::: And it'll be great for Mrs. Salter's beach field trip next Tuesday.
Liam::: Phew.
Rusty::: I'm here with Team Captain Lynn Loud, who--
Mrs. Gurdle:::  Zachary, there's alien activity at the bowling alley...  ...and your father bowled a turkey! Get down here.
Girl::: Whoa, I really love this new format.
Chandler:::  'Whoa, I really love this new format.'
Dirk::: Hey, Chandler, what's in your locker?
Chandler:::  Not cool, man!
Chandler::: Stop looking at me, skunk!
