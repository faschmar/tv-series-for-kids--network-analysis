Zach::: Man, I hate dodgeball!
Lincoln:::  Me too!
Clyde:::  It's the worst!
Liam::: I'd rather milk an ornery cow!
Rusty::: Chill out, guys! Just like we practiced.  Snake formation!
Rusty::: So, we're all chilling at my place again today? Left!
Zach::: Sure. Oh! We can make another popcorn pizza!
Rusty::: Right!
Lincoln::: Sorry, guys!
Rusty::: Left!
Lincoln::: I can't make it.
Rusty::: Right!
Clyde::: Lincoln, you haven't hung out with us for all week!
Lincoln::: I know. I've just had this thing to take care of.
Lincoln:::  Have fun guys! Catch ya later!  Hey! Girl Jordan! The whistle blew! 
Clyde::: You know, I'm worried about Lincoln. It isn't like him to not want to hang out.
Zach:::  You think maybe an alien has taken over his body?
Rusty::: That would explain the white hair.
Clyde::: Guys! It's not an alien. Lincoln and I have a signal for that if that happens.
Liam::: Well, something ain't right!
Clyde::: We're Lincoln's friends and we have to do something.
Liam::: Respect his privacy?
Clyde::: No, we are totally going to spy on him and find out what's going on!  Hey! Girl Jordan! The whistle blew!
Rusty::: Ronnie Anne's old house? This is where he's been coming everyday?
Zach::: Doesn't he know she moved?
Clyde::: I think I know what's going on here.
Clyde::: Lincoln's got a classic case of PBB.
Zach::: Peanut Butter Breath?
Clyde::: No.
Rusty::: Pale Boy Bangs?
Clyde::: No.
Liam::: Polybrominated Biphenyls?
Clyde::: No. Lincoln has PBB, or Post Breakup Blues. The poor guy misses Ronnie Anne so much that he's coming here everyday to pine for her.  I learned all about it in the pamphlets I collected in Dr. Lopez's Waiting Room.
Zach::: So, what do we do? Should we talk to him about it?
Clyde::: No! The pamphlet says that will just send him into a denial spiral. The only way to reverse PBB and get closure is to distract her from thinking about Ronnie Anne by using a three step process called BBP. The first boy is for boys' night out!
Liam:::  Oh! My meemaw said I have to be home before dark.
Lincoln::: A boys' afternoon out sounds great, guys! What brought this on?
Liam::: Your PBB.
Lincoln:::  My what?
Zach:::  Uh...your Pale Boy Bangs. They're so pretty, the world needs to see 'em!
Rusty:::  Come on, Lincoln! First thing this boys' afternoon out needs is some new threads.  My dad said he'd hook us up.
Rodney::: Now there's five happenin' cats! You're gonna be fighting off the ladies with a stick!
Liam::: Aw, dang. I didn't bring my stick.
Clyde::: Yeah, thanks.
Lincoln::: These are great!
Rusty::: Thanks again, Dad!
Rodney::: Now, you kids have fun. Make sure to return the suits by tonight, and don't get a single spot on 'em...  ...OR YOU'LL BE GROUNDED FOR A MONTH!  Have fun!
Zach::: Anyone else feel like havin' buffalo wings?
Clyde::: And nachos!
Lincoln::: Chili fries!
Liam::: Darn tootin'!
Rusty:::  Uh, guys?
Rusty:::  Careful, guys! Zach, napkin!  Lincoln, watch that sauce! 
Zach:::  It's working. He looks happy.
Clyde:::  These pamphlets have never steered me wrong.
Liam::: Ooh-wee, I love this song!
Lincoln::: You know who else loves this song? Ronnie Anne. 
Liam::: Oh, uh, I just remembered. I hate this song. 
Waitress::: Let me tell you guys about our dessert specials. We've got the heart-shaped cookie, the lovers' sundae for two, and the tira-miss-you! 
Clyde:::  Nobody wants desserts! Let's play some games!
Lincoln:::  I wanted dessert.
Clyde:::  Let's play Dance Dance Revolution!  Never mind.
Zach:::  Let's just watch some TV.
Clyde::: Uh-oh. Those are Ronnie Anne's favorite tag-team wrestlers: Payne and Suffering.
Liam::: Uh, this place is lame. Who's up for a boys' day out music montage? 
Lincoln::: This boys' day out has been a blast, you guys!
Clyde::: That's great to hear, Lincoln.  Would you say you feel-  -a sense of closure and more optimistic about the future?
Lincoln:::  Um, that's pretty specific, but...yeah, I guess.
Lincoln:::  Whoops! Sorry, guys. I have to go take care of that thing again. 
Zach::: Ugh! I can't believe it!
Rusty::: So much for closure.
Zach::: He's back at Ronnie Anne's.
Liam::: Ooh-wee, he got it bad for that gal.
Clyde::: Don't worry. Minor setback. The pamphlet says this can happen. If the first B in BBP doesn't work, you just move onto the second B: Beautiful Ladies.
Rusty::: That's my favorite B.  Guys, protect the suits! Snake formation!  Ha! You can't beat the Rust Man that easily!  NOOOOOOO!!!
Rusty:::  Oh man. What am I gonna tell my dad about those suits?!
Liam::: Aw, don't worry. You can get bird poop out. It's donkey poop you gotta worry about.
Clyde:::  Here comes Lincoln. We're all clear about what to do?
Lincoln::: Hey, guys.
Clyde::: Hey, buddy! You took care of your...thing?
Lincoln::: Yep. 
Clyde:::  Glad you could hang out some more.
Liam:::  I declare, Zach, isn't that your friend Renee over there in yonder comic book store?
Zach:::  You are right, Liam. She is probably there because she is a huge Ace Savvy fan.
Rusty:::  Hey, Lincoln, you're a huge Ace Savvy fan, too. You should go talk to her.
Lincoln::: I don't-
Lincoln::: It's so cool to meet someone who loves Ace as much as I do!
Renee::: Same here.
Lincoln::: Whoa! Is that the limited edition Christmas issue with the variant cover?
Renee::: Deck the Halls? I've been looking for that forever!
Lincoln::: Me too!
Lincoln and Renee::: It's the only copy.  GIVE IT! IT'S MINE!
Clyde::: Looks like we're gonna need another beautiful lady.  And an ice pack.
Clyde:::  Hey, Liam, isn't that your cousin, Hattie?
Liam:::  Tar-r-rnation! I didn't see her horse parked outside. Lincoln, you should sit next to her. She's a bigger sci-fi fan than you are. 
Hattie::: Ooooh! My, my, how do? I'm Hattie. 
Lincoln:::  I'm Lincoln.
Hattie:::  You done seen this picture before? Oooh! I love the part where the alien becomes human!
Audience::: Boo!
Lincoln:::  Kind of a spoiler.
Hattie::: That ain't nothing. Turns out the whole thing's just a dream!
Theater Attendant::: She did NOT just say that!
Theater Attendant::: Aw, come on!
Clyde::: Rusty, you must know some beautiful ladies.
Rusty:::  Well, you know...
Zach:::  Yeah. You're always bragging about what a ladies' man you are.
Rusty:::  It's tough on such short notice-
Liam:::  Come on, man! It's for Lincoln!
Rusty:::  Uh, sure. I can make a call.
Rusty::: Ah. Here comes the lovely lady now.
Tina::: Hello, Rusty. I'm very excited to meet this white-haired gentleman you told me about.
Clyde:::  Rusty, who is that?!
Rusty:::  Uh...my piano teacher?
Rusty::: Guys, give me a break! I've been going through a bit of a dry spell.
Zach:::  What are we gonna do, guys? Nothing seems to be working.
Karate Girl::: Hi-  YAH!
Clyde::: Wait a minute, guys! Maybe instead of meeting someone who likes the same things as Lincoln, he needs to meet someone who likes the same things as Ronnie Anne.
Zach::: Ooooh! Good thinking, man!
Rusty::: You should write your own pamphlets, dawg!
Lincoln::: Well, I finally got all the hot buttered popcorn out of my hair and-  Aah!
Clyde:::  Hey, we were thinking about doing some group karate. 
Lincoln::: Uh, guys? I thought you said group.
Karate Girl:::  Oh. Did you want to spar?
Lincoln::: No. Uh, that's-
Zach::: Uh...I don't think beautiful girls is doing the trick.
Karate Girl::: HI-YAH! 
Clyde::: Well, in that case, it's time to move onto the final letter of BBP: P for Paradise. The pamphlet says Tahiti and Hawaii are good options.
Karate Girl::: WAH-WAH-WAH-WAH!
Rusty::: Hmm...sounds a little out of our budget.
Lincoln:::  Hazeltucky Motel and Water Park.
Liam::: Yep. Three days in paradise. We even packed your bag.
Lincoln::: Uh, guys, I appreciate the thought, but why are you doing this?
Clyde::: Because, buddy, it's the only way to cure your PBB!
Lincoln:::  I have Peanut Butter Breath, and no one told me?!
Clyde::: No. Post Breakup Blues. We know Ronnie Anne broke your heart when she moved away, and we're trying to help you put the pieces back together.
Liam::: Yeah. We seen you standing outside her house, lookin' like a cat who done lost his saucer.
Lincoln:::  Oh, man, that's what this is all about? Guys, you got it all wrong. I don't miss Ronnie Anne.
Clyde::: Here comes the denial spiral.
Lincoln::: No, seriously, I was only sitting in front of her house because-
Bus Driver::: All aboard!
Clyde::: He'll thank us later.
Zach::: Yeah. I just hope he knows how lucky he is to have friends like us.
Clyde:::  Huh. Lincoln must have dropped his phone.  Ronnie Anne?! Ugh! Unbelievable! She's still tormenting him? I'll handle this.  Hello, Ronnie Anne. This is Clyde, Lincoln's best friend.
Ronnie Anne::: I know who you are, Clyde. Where's Lincoln?
Clyde::: You need to leave him alone!
Rusty::: Yeah! He needs space to get over you!
Ronnie Anne::: Get over me?
Zach::: Yeah. Since you left, the poor guy's just been standing in front of your old house everyday.
Ronnie Anne::: Yeah! Because I asked him to look out for a package that was sent to me there!
Clyde::: How's that now?
Clyde, Rusty, Liam, and Zach:::  Uh-oh...
Ronnie Anne:::  Did you guys do something stupid again?
Clyde::: We have to stop that bus!
Rusty::: Snake formation! It'll cut down wind resistance!
Ronnie Anne::: I'm glad they caught you in time.
Lincoln::: Yeah. I've never seen Clyde run that fast. He actually threw up.
Ronnie Anne::: You must've been furious with them for putting you through all of that.
Lincoln::: Nah. They were just trying to be good friends. Besides, I think they're suffering enough right now.
Rusty:::  Man, this bird poop isn't coming out.
Liam::: Maybe I was wrong. Maybe it's donkey poop that comes out easy and it's that dang bird poop that you gotta worry about.
Lincoln::: Well, the good news is, your package finally arrived! 
Ronnie Anne::: Cool! Hey, could you open it for me? I wanna make sure it's not damaged.
Ronnie Anne:::  Oh, man. That cost me 25 bucks, but it was so worth it. Smell ya later, lame-o. 
Lincoln:::  Ugh! Ronnie Anne!  Ha! I guess the guys were right. I really do miss her.
