Burglar #1::: Alright, old lady, hand over the walker.
Phoebe Powers::: You guys should always respect your elders.
CJ::: Woah!
Ronnie Anne::: I knew it was Phoebe Powers in disguise. Hurry, Abuelo. You're missing it.
Carl::: Oh, and don't forget the snacks.
Hector::: Ooh, did I miss her 'facey' thing? That's my favorite part.  No, Lalo!
Ronnie Anne:::  The TV's on the fritz again.
Hector:::  Lalo, these aren't for you.
Boy::: You saved the day, Phoebe Powers.
Ronnie Anne::: And so did you, Abuelo.
Bobby::: You fixed the TV.
Carl::: Wait, is that who I think it is?
Carlota::: He didn't tell us he was coming.
Ronnie Anne:::  Who is that guy?
Carlota, CJ & Carl::: Grandpa Danny!
Carl::: He's the coolest.
Carlota::: You're gonna love him, Ronnie Anne. He's a movie stuntman.
Hector:::  Oh, no, not that bobo again.
Danny::: Grandpa Dan is here. I brought presents!
Carl::: My favourite kind of present. I'll never grow out of it.
Hector:::  I give them allowance sometimes.
Frida::: Papá!
Danny::: Mi amorcito, I saw these fancy tissues and I thought of you.
Frida::: They feel like silky pillows and smell like cotton candy. 
CJ:::  Hi, Grandpa Danny.
Carl::: You're really here.
Danny::: You can't be mis nietos. You're all so tall. And Carlota, you're more stylish than the celebrities I work with.
Carlota::: Grandpa, stop!  But which celebrities, exactly?
Danny:::  You must be Bobby and Ronnie Anne. You can call me Grandpa, too. Or... Number one grandpa.  Now bring it in.
Bobby & Ronnie Anne::: Number one grandpa! Number one grandpa! Number one grandpa!
Vito::: Heya, Hector.
Hector::: Que grandpa? I'm Bobby and Ronnie Anne's grandpa, not him. That bobo's always showing up to steal the spotlight.
Vito::: That's the famous Grandpa Danny? I don't get it. Take away his cash, his looks, and his bike, what do you have left?
Sergio:::  Hector.  Ow! The truth hurts.
Vito::: You're just as cool as that guy.  Woah! Is he doing handstand push-ups?
Frida, Ronnie Anne, Bobby, Carl & Carlota::: Go, go, go, go, go…
Vito::: Oh, forget about it. You can eat a bowl of cereal right off your stomach with no hands. Can Mr. Washboard Abs do that?
Hector::: You're right, Vito. I may not be a motorcycle stunt guy, but I've done a few cool things in my day.
Vito::: Woah, you won a Halloween contest?
Hector::: I was a bull rider! Never mind. The point is, I'm gonna show those kids that I'm the coolest grandpa around.
Hector::: Hey, kids, look what your awesome abuelo brought you! You're favourite snacks.  What?
Bobby::: Check it out, Abuelo. Grandpa Danny learnt how to make these crepes on his last movie set.
Ronnie Anne::: It was Phoebe Powers' new movie, 'The Crepes of Wrath'.
Danny::: Want a crepe, Hector?
Hector:::  I can make my own, creep.  Excuse me. I meant 'crepe'. 
Hector::: There's got to be another way for me to beat Danny at being cool.
Vito::: Hey, how's about your music? I bet Danny can't shred like you.
Hector::: You're right, Vito. I am the only talented musician around here.
Vito::: That was beautiful. But if you wanna beat someone as flashy as Danny, you're gonna need more current material.
Hector::: Yo, yo, yo. I bet you kids didn't know your abuelo knew how to rap.
Danny:::  Did somebody say rap? Did I mention I sang backup rap vocals on Phoebe Powers' new single?  Sergio, drop a beat!  I roll down the road from set to set. With all my homies like P. Powers on her private jet. Stunt master flying through the air on my moto. If you really wanna see me then you probably need a telephoto.  And while you try to be sly, and you write your reply. And you try to be fly as this guy. Let me give you a little piece of advice, keep trying.
Kids::: Rap battle! Rap battle! Rap battle! Rap battle!
Hector::: Uh…  Listen up. Hector here, rapping from my sofa. My rap is so clean, it's like a loofah.
Carl::: Ooh!
Bobby::: What's a loofah?
Carl::: Whatever it is, it doesn't rhyme with sofa.
Danny::: Está bien, Hector? Cause I been rappin' for a minute, bro. Sigueme, niños, let me get you some fro-yo.  Hector, join us.
Hector:::  Only because I can't say no to fro-yo.
Carl::: Grandpa Danny, can I get two scoops?
Danny::: Two scoops of every flavour.
Hector::: Quick, everyone, better catch the train.  Oh, is that the express? We need the local. Oopsie.
Danny:::  Hec-torrrrr!
Hector::: Oh, no, poor Grandpa Danny. Wave goodbye.  Now let's go get our fro-yo.
Carl::: Can I still have every flavour?
Hector:::  No.
Danny::: Hector, I just spent three hours on a subway train because of you! What was that about?
Hector::: Don't act innocent with me. I know you're trying to steal the kid's attention by acting all cool.
Danny::: What?! Oh, now I get it. You've been trying to compete with me this whole time? That's ridiculous.  You could never win, old man.
Hector::: Old man? You're older than I am!
Danny:::  Not according to your hairline.
Vito:::  Hey, Hector.
Danny::: Can an old man do this?
Vito:::  If I toss my cookies it's on you. Literally.
Hector::: Big whoop.  Check this out.
Danny::: Fine. if it's a competition you want, then may the coolest grandpa win. 
Hector:::  You're… going… down.
Danny::: Let's settle this once and for all.
Danny::: Don't try this at home. Now count me down.
Kids:::  Tres, dos, uno, blast off!
Carl:::  Wow!
CJ::: What he said.
Bobby::: I applaud you, Grandpa!
Ronnie Anne::: He's cooler than Phoebe Powers.
Vito::: Unbelievable! Sorry, Hector. Can't compete with that.
Hector::: Oh yes I can.
Kids::: Tres, dos, uno. Blast off!
Carl::: Hey, Abuelo's pretty good.
Ronnie Anne::: Go, Abuelo.
Carl::: Wrong day to wear red chonies, Abuelo!
Hector:::  Uh-oh.
Danny::: I'm sorry you got hurt, Hector. You shouldn't have tried to compete with me. You've just gotta accept it, old man.
Hector::: Yeah, yeah. You're the cool grandpa.
Carl::: What's for breakfast, Abuelo?
Hector:::  You'll have to ask your other grandpa.
Danny::: Hey, kids, vamanos.
Carl:::  I want cereal.
CJ::: I want pancakes.
Ronnie Anne::: Can I get a smoothie?
Carlota::: You're on laundry duty today, Grandpa Danny.
Carl:::  Carlitos wants you to change him.
Danny::: These kids are…  Is that my bike?
Sergio::: Ooh!  Look out.
Danny::: Oh-no!
Carl:::  Grandpa!
Danny::: I don't know how to do this. It's easy to be cool for a few days, but the stuff you do every day is way harder.  Hector, I'm sorry. I didn't realize how hard it is to be an everyday grandpa. I think this belongs to you.
Hector::: Thank you, Danny. I appreciate you saying that. Friends?
Danny::: Friends!
Carl::: Woah! We have two awesome abuelos.
Hector::: Let's take this for a spin!
Danny::: Abuelo locos forever!
