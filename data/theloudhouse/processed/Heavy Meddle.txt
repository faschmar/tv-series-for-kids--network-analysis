Lincoln:::  Really?
Lincoln:::  Oh, real original!
Lincoln:::  That's real mature!
Lincoln:::  All right! That's it!
Clyde::: So, you really confronted that bully?
Lincoln::: That's right. I said to meet me at 3:30 in front of my house, and we're gonna settle this.
Clyde:::  Whoa! You're gonna fight?!
Lincoln::: I'm not an animal, Clyde. I'm going to deliver a strongly worded speech...as soon as I write it.
Clyde:::  Looks like that bully left you a note of their own.
Lincoln::: Huh?  Lame-O.
Clyde:::  Ooh! Watermelon lime!
Lincoln::: Better not let my sisters see this, 'cause then they'll want to get involved and make things worse, the way they always do.
Clyde::: I don't know. Maybe they'd be helpful. Your sister Lori gives great advice. She told me to never be myself. I love that woman. 
Lincoln::: Aw, Clyde. Sweet, innocent Clyde. He has no idea what it's like to have ten meddling sisters.
Lincoln::: Phew.
Leni:::  Here comes the airplane!  Oopsie.
Lincoln:::  Aahh! It burns!
Lincoln:::  And that was just a paper cut!
Clyde::: Well, then, you'd better get that gum out. You wanna look intimidating for that bully.
Lincoln::: I was born intimidating.  Ew, ew! Gross!
Clyde::: You know, peanut butter will get that gum out.
Lincoln::: Should I use chunky or smooth?
Clyde::: Well, if you use chunky, you're gonna have to use smooth to get the chunks out.
Lincoln::: Good point. Thanks, pal.
WEATHER REPORT::: CLEAR SKIES
Lincoln::: The National Weather Service reports clear skies with only a 20% chance of meddling sisters. But we advise keeping your umbrella handy.
Lincoln::: Shh... 
Lily::: Shh...
Lincoln::: Shh... 
Lori:::  Hold it right there!
Lori::: He wore cargo shorts on your date? That is literally the worst thing I have ever heard.
Lincoln::: Phew.  Peanut butter, peanut butter...where's the peanut butter?
Luna::: Hey, bro.
Lincoln::: Oh, hey, Luna. What's the haps?
Luna:::  Rad way to chill out, bro.
Lincoln::: Right. Totally rad.
Luna::: Hey, hook me up with some pudding.
Lincoln:::  Gross! 
Luna::: Thanks. Stay cool. 
Lincoln::: Peanut butter!  Ah! Why do people put empty jars back in the fridge?!  I need a Plan B.
Lori:::  Socks and sandals? Cut it out!
Lincoln::: Cut it out. That's it! 
Lori::: Now that is literally the worst thing I have ever heard.
Lincoln::: Hey, Luan.
Luan::: Hey, Lincoln. What do you think of this joke? If I were you, I'd go for the baboon!
Lincoln:::  I don't get it.
Luan::: Oh. Well, that's just the punchline. I still gotta think of the setup. 
Rita:::  Lincoln, honey! I need you to take out the trash!
Lincoln::: Okay, Mom! Five minutes!
Rita::: Not five minutes! Now!
Lincoln::: I will! Just give me three minutes!
Lynn Sr.::: Lincoln, listen to your mother!
Leni::: Hey, Lincoln. Is my desk lamp in there? I can't find it anywhere.
Lincoln::: Nope. Have you tried looking on your desk?
Leni::: So smart!  What's up with that hat?
Lincoln::: Oh, this?  These are all the rage right now. I'm surprised you didn't know.
Leni:::  Hmm...
Lincoln::: Phew. 
Lisa::: Greetings, human. There's Liquidambar Styraciflua in your follicular area.
Lincoln::: A what in my who now?
Lisa::: You've got gum in your hair.
Lincoln::: Oh, yes. I'm sure it's just-
Lisa::: I assume that being of average intelligence, you didn't place it there yourself. Therefore, I can only deduce that someone has been picking on you.
Lincoln:::  Lisa, please! You can't tell! I don't want everyone getting involved.
Lisa::: Don't worry. I do not have enough room in my brain for this kind of tomfoolery. 
Lincoln::: Phew. 
Lynn::: You're being picked on!
Lincoln:::  Lisa, I thought you weren't going to say anything.
Lisa::: No. What I said was I did not have room in my brain for your secret. Hence, I removed it and transferred it to Lynn, whose brain apparently has ample room.
Lynn::: Thanks.  Hey!
Luna::: So, you are being picked on!
Lincoln:::  Of course not!
Luan:::  Then what's that?
Lincoln::: That's just my gum.  Mmm...watermelon lime. And hair!
Lincoln:::  Guys! Guys! Please stay out of this! You'll only make it worse!
Lori::: If by worse you mean better, I agree.
Lola::: You should go straight to the school principal!
Lori::: Forget that. You should literally text an embarrassing picture of him to all his friends.
Luan::: I'm gonna write an insult comedy routine that will leave him in tears!
Lynn:::  Hoo-wah!  Basic stealth ninja kick. That's how you're gonna take him down.

Lincoln::: Look, I don't need any-
Luan::: We'll start with some basic dumb jokes. Like, You're so dumb you locked yourself inside your car. That kind of thing.
Lola::: Ooh I know! I'll invite him to a tea party and make him use the chipped cup!  I'm so evil, sometimes I scare even me.
Lincoln::: What are you doing?
Lynn:::  Surprise mime attack! I invented that one myself.
Lincoln:::  Lynn, I'm not going to fight. I-
Lynn::: Ugh! Fine! I'll take care of this myself. 
Luna::: You should do this!  His ears'll be ringing for days!
Luan::: Ugly jokes are always good, too. Like, You're so ugly, you have to trick-or-treat over the phone!
Lincoln:::  What?!
Lynn::: Look! I found him!
Lori::: How dare you bully our brother! Only we get to do that.
Lana:::  Smoosh your watermelon lime gum in his hair, Lincoln!  Fine. I'll do it.
Lincoln::: Wait! Stop! This guy isn't my enemy! Although, thanks to you, he probably will be now.
Lynn::: Oh.  Why are you still here?
Lana::: I can't believe I almost wasted perfectly good gum on him. 
Lynn::: I'll go get another boy. 
Lincoln::: No! Lynn, stop! It's not even a boy!
Leni::: Is it a dog?
Lincoln:::  It's a girl...
Sisters execpt Lisa::: AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Lincoln:::  What?
Lisa::: Normally, I don't care for inane human emotions, but...EEEEEE!!!!!!
Luna::: Lincoln! Why didn't you tell us you had a girlfriend?!
Lola::: She sounds so pretty!
Lincoln:::  What is happening?
Lori::: When a girl picks on you, that only ever means one thing: she likes you!
Sisters::: AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Lincoln:::  That's ridiculous! She shoved a sandwich down my pants! I was picking sesame seeds out of my butt for days!
Leni::: So romantic...
Lori::: That's a classic.
Lincoln:::  You guys are nuts! She hates me! I'm gonna meet her today and give her a piece of my mind!
Lori::: You need to give her a piece of your heart instead.
Lincoln:::  What?!
Leni::: I think he needs to kiss her.
Lincoln:::  What?!
Sisters::: Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!
Lincoln::: This just in from the National Weather Service! The Sisternado watch has been upgraded to a Sisternado warning. Take cover immediately!
Sisternado::: Kiss her! Kiss her!  Kiss her! Kiss her!
Lincoln::: Mayday! Mayday! Clyde, do you copy?
Clyde::: Roger. I mean, this is Clyde, not Roger. But yeah. Roger, it's Clyde.
Lincoln:::  My sisters have lost their minds! They think the bully likes me! They want me to kiss her!
Clyde::: I don't know. Maybe they're right, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: My sisters are never right! All they do is meddle.
Clyde::: They're girls, Lincoln. They know more about these things than we do. It's a scientific fact.
Lincoln::: Yeah, but there's no way that-  Wow. Me? You really think she might like me? How would I know?
Clyde::: There's only one way to find out.
Sisternado::: Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!
Lincoln::: Hold it!
Lincoln::: So am I going to kiss this girl or what? 
Lisa::: Again... EEEEEE!!!!!!

Lincoln::: It's 3:30. Lola, lip balm.  Lana, breath mint.  Let's do this. 
Lynn::: Go get her, Romeo.
Lori::: You so got this, little bro.
Lola::: Aw, our little Lincoln.
Lana::: All grown up.
Leni::: All the bridesmaids should wear these hats at Lincoln's wedding. These are all the rage right now.
Sisters:::  Aww!
Sisters except Lucy:::  Ooh!
Luna::: Sorry, buddy. Our bad.
Luan::: Well, at least, you gave it a shot.
Lynn::: I'll get some ice for that shiner.
Lisa::: X-ray machine, stat.
Leni::: I'm really sorry, Lincoln.
Lincoln:::  Quiet! Every time you guys butt into my life, you make things worse! Well, guess what? Never again! No! More! Meddling! 
Lincoln::: I knew it all along. I should never have listened to them. My sisters are always wrong.
Lincoln::: Huh? 
Lincoln::: Sorry, Lame-O. Here's my number. Text me?  For your eye. XOXO, Ronnie Anne.  Okay, maybe just this one time my sisters were right. But don't tell them that!
