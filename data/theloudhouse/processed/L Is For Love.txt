Lincoln:::  Emergency sibling meeting! I call an emergency sibling meeting!
Luan::: Come on! I was working on a joke.
Lori::: I hereby call this meeting to order. Lisa, can you read the minutes from the last meeting?
Lisa:::  Item 1: It was resolved that in the matter of Lily's diaper pail-
Lincoln:::  Forget that! We need to discuss...  ...this! It's a love letter, and it's addressed to L. Loud.
Lana:::  Oh, dang it. I just swallowed my gum.
Lori::: Dear L. Loud, Day after day, I hope and I pine,
Lynn::: W-w-wait! Who's it for? L. Loud could be any one of us.
Lori::: Clearly, the letter's for me, and it's from Bobby. I mean, duh, right?
Luan::: No, not duh! That letter could be for any of us!
Lily, Lola, Lana, Lynn, Luan, Luna, and Leni::: 
Lucy::: Sigh...
Lori::: Okay, we all want the letter to be for us. How do we figure out who it's really for?
Lucy::: Simple. Since the writer is clearly shy, we each need to send a signal to the person we think wrote it, letting them know we're interested. Then they'll probably send a second letter, giving us more information.
Lori:::  Um...how do you know all this?
Lucy:::  Vampires send a lot of secret admirer letters. They may be passionate, but they're also painfully insecure.
Lori::: Sending a signal it is!
Silas::: Sigh.
Lucy::: Ah, the futility of life. Am I right, Silas?
Leni::: Hi.
Lisa::: Based upon the fluttering of your gorgeous eyelids, you must have had quite a REM cycle.
Lincoln::: Nice moves, Paige!  I said, nice move-
Lori::: Meeting called to order.
Lisa::: I'll begin with the minutes from the last meeting.  Item 1: No one would let me read the minutes from the previous meeting, so-
Lola:::  And we still won't!  Now, did everyone send their signals?
Lori::: I texted Bobby a series of romantic emojis.
Luan::: Yep! I toot-ally sent mine to Benny.
Lola::: I let Winston know the score.
Lana:::  And I let Skippy know I'm game by souping up his ride.
Lori::: Good work, everyone. Now, we just have to wait for-
Luna::: Dudes! A second letter! You called it, Luce Change!
Lana:::  Dang it, I swallowed my gum again!
Lori::: Okay.  Roses are red, they brighten our town,
Lincoln, Leni, Lucy, Lola, and Lana::: Aw, dang it!
Lily:::  Ah, poo-poo.
Lori:::  I have some different emojis for Bobby now!
Lincoln::: So, the secret admirer contest is down to Luna, Luan, Lynn, and Lisa.
Leni::: Luna, why aren't you cheering?
Luan::: Yeah. And come to think of it, you never told us the signal you gave Sam.
Luna:::  That's 'cause I didn't give one. The more I thought about it, the more I realized...Sam's way out of my league, dudes.
Lincoln::: No way. That's not true.
Lori::: Yeah, Luna, you are totes still in this. Okay, Lucy, what's the next step?
Lucy::: Well, since the secret admirer sent a rose as a token of their affection, we need to deliver a token in return. Then there should be a third and final love letter requesting a rendezvous.
Luna::: Rockin'!
Luan::: This is so exciting!
Lynn::: I hope it's me!
Lisa::: Me too!
Lola:::  Me three!
Lana:::  Nice try, Blondie.
Lisa::: For you.
David::: Your flowers and poem were a decent start,
Lisa::: It's from a pig in the biology lab.
Lisa::: Eh. Guess he's more of a chemistry guy.
Lynn::: Because I think you really rock,
Luan::: It's true that I do a whole lot of jokin',
Luan:::  I guess you really fell hard for me!  Get it? Ooh!  Stop it, Luan. We're trying to find love here!
Luna:::  Roses are red, Mick Swagger is sick,
Luna:::  Dream on, Lunes. You're the owner of a lonely heart.
Lori::: Okay, brown-haired Louds, did everybody deliver their tokens?
Lynn::: Check!
Luan::: You betcha!
Lisa::: Affirmative!
Luna::: I bailed, dudes. I'm telling you, there's no way Sam digs me.
Lola:::  Some of us blondes would kill to still be in the running!  Don't you quit now!
Leni::: OMGosh, you guys! The secret admirer is the mailman!  He just handed me this letter! I don't feel the same way about him, so I let him down gently.
Lori:::  Dear L. Loud,
Lincoln::: Luna! It's definitely you!
Lori::: Guys, Lucy was right about what happens next! Listen!  I think it's time we put love on the menu  Aw.  Meet me tonight at Banger's & Mosh, the British eatery and rock venue.
Luna:::  Whoa! This is really happening! What do I wear?
Leni::: I'll be right there! I-I just wanna make sure the mailman is okay.
Luna::: Guys, I don't see Sam anywhere.
Lana::: Maybe Sam's hidden behind that dork in the big British hat.
Lynn::: Whoa! That dork is sitting with Mom!  Oh. It's Dad.
Lynn Sr.::: Kids? What're you guys doing here?
Lincoln::: Luna got a secret admirer letter from Sam telling her to meet here.
Lana::: We're here for moral support.
Lola::: And dessert.
Rita::: Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. There's been a mix-up. That letter was meant for your father.
Leni::: Wait. Sam likes Dad?
Rita::: No, sweetie. I sent the letter.
Lynn Sr.::: Secret admirer letters are kind of our thing. It's how we met.
Rita::: Back in the day, I had a wicked crush on your father.
Rita:::  Every morning, at my crossing guard job, I'd listen for his melodious voice.  And when he talked to me in that cute accent-  -he picked up from his semester in England, I'd swoon.
Young Lynn Sr.:::  Ello, love! Pip-pip! Mind the gap!
Rita::: But I was too afraid to speak to him because I thought he was out of my league. So, I started slipping notes in his pocket as he passed by.
Lynn Sr.:::  Crossing
Rita::: By my third note, I got up the nerve to ask him to meet me here.
Rita::: And my boldness paid off, because here we are, celebrating the 20th anniversary of that first date.
Lynn Sr.:::  Best day of my life, love.
Rita::: Luna, I'm sorry that letter wasn't for you. I hope you're not too disappointed.
Luna::: Well...I was at first, but now that I've heard your story, I'm totally inspired. If you took a risk with Dad, why can't I take a risk with Sam?  Why are we sitting around waiting for them to come to us? We should go to them!
Lynn Sr.::: This is cause for celebration! MEAT PIES FOR EVERYONE!
Lynn Sr.::: Uh, I-I meant just for my family.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, come on! There's 13 of us!
Mazzy::: See you later, Sam.
Sam::: Okay, see ya!
