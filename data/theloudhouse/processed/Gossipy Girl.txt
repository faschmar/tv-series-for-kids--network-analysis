Sameer::: You're up, Casey. Truth or dare?
Casey:::  Truth.
Sameer::: Alright, what's your most embarrassing secret?
Casey:::  Aw. Okay. My most embarrassing secret is… I'm the Mystery Stinker.
Sameer::: No way!
Sid::: You stunk up the whole bus.
Nikki:::  I still smell it sometimes. 
Casey::: I'll never eat meatloaf again.  Okay, Sameer, truth or dare?
Sameer::: Dare.
Casey::: I dare you to… run backwards until your next turn.
Sameer::: Sorry, Breakfast Bot.
Breakfast Bot::: Oh, I'll make another round.
Sergio:::  Hey, Breakfast Bot, you got Wi-fi? Need to message Priscilla.
Breakfast Bot::: Beat it. Use your own phone.
Sergio::: I can't, she blocked my number.
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, truth.
Nikki::: Let's see… Tell us your most embarrassing secret ever.
Ronnie Anne:::  Okay, last week I had a dream... that I married Artemis from Lucha club.
Laird::: Was I there?
Ronnie Anne::: Okay it was a dumb dream. You guys better not tell anyone.
Sid::: Of course not, Ronnie Anne. Those are the truth or dare rules. We take them very seriously.
Breakfast Bot:::  Ice cream time.
Becky:::  Look, everyone. Here comes the bride!  Your groom Artemis awaits you.
Ronnie Anne:::  Aye, chihuahua!  Are those doves?
Becky::: Runaway bride!
Ronnie Anne:::  How could you, guys? I thought we were friends! Who broke the rules and texted my secret to the whole school? 
Sid::: It wasn't me!
Laird::: I didn't do it!
Nikki::: I swear on my skateboard it wasn't me.
Ronnie Anne::: Well, you're the only ones I told about my dream, which means someone here is lying.
Sameer::: She's right, something here stinks.
Casey::: Don't look at me, I didn't get the meatloaf today!
Ronnie Anne::: Well, I'm gonna find out who 'Unknown Caller' is.
Ronnie Anne:::  Where's his phone?
Casey::: Huh? Oh, no! My masterpiece!
Dodge::: Hey! I just got a text. Casey's the one who stunk up the bus on the field trip to the aquarium. He's the Mystery Stinker!
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, no! 'Unknown Caller' strikes again. And clearly, it's not you.
Casey:::  No. I'm just the Mystery Stinker. You eat one piece of meatloaf and your life is over. I'll have to move towns, change my name.  I've always liked the name, Julio.
Ronnie Anne::: I've got to get to the bottom of this. I'm gonna check everyone else's phones to see who's sending these messages.
Casey::: That's a great idea!  I'll help.
Nikki::: Yes!
Sameer & Nikki:::  Huh?
Sameer::: I can't see!
Nikki::: Turn down the potato!
Girl Classmate::: Guess what! Sameer wheres lifts in his shoes to make him taller.
Boy Classmate::: And Nikki's afraid of sock puppets.
Ronnie Anne::: It couldn't have been them either.
Ronnie Anne::: I think ‘Unknown Caller' might be Laird.
Casey::: He's certainly acting suspicious.
Laird::: Aw, come on!
Nikki::: How do we get to his phone?
Sameer::: Leave it to Sameer.  Yo, Laird, catch!
Laird::: Oh dear.
Soccer Player #1::: Hey, give that back.
Laird:::  I don't even play sports ball!
Sameer:::  Okay, got it.  Hey, Laird just got a text.  Laird picks his nose with his feet.
Casey::: Gross, and impressive.
Ronnie Anne::: Laird didn't do it. Which means the only person left is…
Ronnie Anne::: Sid!
Sameer::: You've been the one texting our secrets.
Laird::: How could you?!
Nikki::: Not cool!
Casey::: I have to move towns now!
Sid::: What?! I swear I didn't do it. These lips have been zipped.
Ronnie Anne::: But you're the only one who hasn't been totally humiliated by an embarrassing secret.
Sid:::  That's because I only did dares during the game. I would never betray your trust.  Oh, I have to go, I'm late for dance class.
Ronnie Anne::: It's true, she did only do dares.
Sameer::: Open your eyes, Ronnie Anne!
Casey::: I think she's playing us. We just need proof.
Ronnie Anne::: I've got it! Come on.
Ronnie Anne::: All we have to do is make up some embarrassing stories. If they're leaked tomorrow, then we'll know it's her.
Laird:::  What if I blow our cover?
Casey:::  Here, sip on this the whole time. Then you won't have to say anything.
Sid::: Say anything about what?
Ronnie Anne::: Sid dog!
Nikki::: Hey!
Sameer::: There she is.
Sid::: I was worried you were still mad at me.
Ronnie Anne::: Of course not. It was just a big misunderstanding.
Sid::: Great! Well, I programmed Breakfast Bot to make us some popcorn.  Next time we'll add a bowl.
Ronnie Anne::: Speaking of snacks… This super embarrassing thing just happened. We were eating these cookies and realized that they're actually Lalo's dog treats.
Sid::: Oh, man, that's the worst! What'd they taste like, Laird?
Laird::: Me?!
Sid:::  Nice one, Laird.
Ronnie Anne::: Way to stay cool under pressure, Laird. The plan totally worked.
Laird:::  I'm just gonna dry off for a while.
Dodge::: Hey, skaters. Just saw the latest text. You eating dog food again?
Ronnie Anne::: A-ha! It was you, Sid! You're 'Unknown Caller'!
Sid::: Wait, what?
Ronnie Anne::: We made up that story about Lalo's treats to see if you'd text it to everyone. This proves it!
Sid::: It's not me, I zipped my lips and everything. 
Ronnie Anne::: This isn't cool, Sid. I'm not talking to you until you fess up.
Sid::: For real? The silent treatment? But I'm telling you the truth! You forgot your lunchbox, Sameer.
Sameer::: Thanks, but…  Sameer's still not talking to you.
Sid::: Ugh! This is so frustrating. My friends won't talk to me and I didn't do anything wrong.
Breakfast Bot::: Want to watch videos to help you sleep?
Sid::: No, whenever I fall asleep watching videos, I do weird things in my sleep.  Wait a minute! I've been falling asleep while watching videos all week! I must have been texting in my sleep!  No time to tango, Cam. I have to make things right.  Fine, one spin.
Breakfast Bot::: I have a message from Sid.
Sid's Voice::: Dear, Ronnie Anne, you were right. I sent those messages while sleep texting. I'm going to make up for it by telling everyone at school my most embarrassing secret. It's so bad I'll have to go into hiding and change my name. I've always liked the sound of Julio. Goodbye forever. Sincerely, Julio Chang.
Ronnie Anne::: Well at least she's finally admitting it.
Sergio:::  Robot, I got another message to send Priscilla.
Ronnie Anne:::  Sid Chang is changing her name to Julio.  Wait a second. Sergio, how long have you been messing with Breakfast Bot?
Breakfast Bot::: Uh, he's been at it all week.
Ronnie Anne::: And, Breakfast Bot, you were at the truth or dare game too. Sergio!  You made Breakfast Bot malfunction. He's the one who's been texting our secrets. Not Sid.
Sergio:::  Would you look at the time.
Breakfast Bot::: Nice going, Feather Brain.
Ronnie Anne:::  That means Sid's innocent. And she's about to embarrass herself in front of the whole school.
Sid::: Fellow students, it is I, Sidney Chang. I'm going to tell you my most embarrassing secret ever.
Sid's Friends:::  Sid, wait!
Sid:::  I have a birthmark on my foot that looks like Abraham Lincoln. Sometimes I talk to it and sometimes it talks to me.  Good morning, Sid.
Ronnie Anne::: This is terrible. And it's our fault.
Casey::: I can't watch this.
Ronnie Anne:::  Pshh! That's nothing, Sid. You know what's really embarrassing? I sometimes dance like this…
Sid::: Huh?
Laird::: I still carry around my blankie and it's never been washed. 
Sameer::: And I put mayo in my hair to give it volume. 
Nikki:::  My big toe is super hairy. 
Casey::: I keep a jar of my baby teeth under my hat. 
Sid::: You guys, why did you do that?
Ronnie Anne::: We found out you weren't ‘Unknown Caller'. Sergio made Breakfast Bot malfunction, and that's how our secrets got out. We were wrong to accuse you.
Sameer::: We screwed up.
Casey::: Sorry.
Nikki::: Our bad.
Laird:::  Can you ever forgive us?
Sid:::  What do you think, Abe?  All is forgiven.
Ronnie Anne::: Thank you, Mr. President.
