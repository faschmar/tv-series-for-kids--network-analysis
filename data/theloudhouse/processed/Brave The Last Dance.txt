Clyde::: Oops, sorry Emma.
Emma::: No worries, Clyde.
Cheryl::: Okay, dance committee, let's recap everyone's duties for the big Valentine's shindig! Miss Chloe, how are those tunes comin'?
Chloe::: Great! I convinced my sister to DJ for us.  This is her playing Sunset Canyon's winter formal.
Cheryl::: Ooh, she had those seniors shakin' their rumps! Good job, Chlo-Chlo! Kay now, Emma honey, how are we doin' with the decorations?
Emma::: Great! Riker has been helping me with the glitter.  It's basically going to be a sparkle explosion!
Cheryl::: Clyde?! Clyde, sugar, have you decided what you're gonna fix for the dessert table?
Clyde:::  Huh? Oh, oh right, dessert table.  I thought I'd keep it simple but elegant.  I've prepared samples. Anyone wanna try?
Chloe and Cheryl::: Yes, please!
Emma::: I do, I do!
Clyde:::  Here you go, Emma.
Cheryl:::  Okay, my little cherubs, I'll see y'all Friday to set up for the big night. Don't forget your dancin' shoes! Oo-ooh! Oo-ooh!
Clyde's Thoughts::: Ask Emma to the dance. Ask Emma to the dance!
Clyde:::  Excuse me.
Rusty:::  So, you wanna ask Emma to the dance huh?
Clyde:::  You can read my mind?!
Zach::: Nah, it's just kind of obvious. So, what's the hold-up?
Clyde::: I'm worried she might say no. I'd be heartbroken, and humiliated!  I can't ask without being a hundred percent sure she likes me.
Rusty::: Relax. Let me go find out if she digs you.
Clyde:::  No offence, but you'd be super obvious about it. There's gotta be a discrete way to find out if she likes me, right?
Stella::: For sure, and we can totally help.
Chloe:::  Bye.
Emma::: See ya, Chloe. 
Rusty::: Okay, it's go time.
Clyde::: What's the plan Rust-man?  Ugh!  Uugh, I smell like piney beef jerky!
Rusty:::  Sweet right? My older cousin told me if a girl comments on your cologne, it means she likes you.
Clyde::: Well, your cousin did have a girlfriend at summer camp so...  Woah!
Emma:::  Oh, Clyde, I didn't know you wore cologne.
Clyde::: Yeah, um, it's like a rustic cedar with beefy undertones.
Emma::: Cool.
Rusty:::  Boom, she totally likes you man.
Clyde::: She did notice the cologne.  But, maybe she's just a super smeller like my cats with tuna. Sorry, but I just need more evidence.
Liam::: It's as easy as rhubarb pie, you just gotta save that seat next to ya. If Emma takes it, she's sweet on you like honey on a biscuit.
Clyde::: Wait, how do you know this stuff?
Liam::: Oh, cause that's how Clucky and Yolko-Ono got together.  Clucky was smitten with Yolko from the moment he laid eyes on her, so he made a special spot next to him in the coop, and she took it.
Clyde::: Well, if it worked for Clucky...  She's coming over.
Liam::: Quick, quick, play it cool.
Emma::: Hey Clyde, is that seat free?
Clyde:::  Yes! Yes it is! All yours! 
Emma::: Oh, thanks Clyde. 
Liam::: Cluck, cluck, looks like Emma's smitten too.
Clyde::: Wait, that was the only seat left. I need more proof.
Zach::: Aren't we a little young to be reading sixteen and a half magazine?
Lincoln::: I borrowed it from Lori. According to this article, the best way to find out if someone likes you is by asking to borrow a pen. If the person gives you a fancy pen like a light-up or pom-pom one, they like you. If they lent you a normal pen, you're just friends. And if they give you a pencil, they don't like you at all.
Clyde & Zach::: Ooh.
Zach::: Ow!
Clyde:::  Let's do this!  Hi Emma, I seem to have lost my pen. Do you have one I can borrow?
Emma::: Sure. Let me just grab my case.  Here, you can borrow... this one.
Clyde's Friends::: Woah.
Lincoln::: Light up and pom-pom?! Looks like you're golden buddy. Are you gonna ask Emma to the dance now?
Clyde::: I don't know. It's a really fancy pen. But, what if it was just the first one she saw?
Stella:::  Come on, Clyde.
Zach:::  Oh. Come on, dude.
Lincoln:::  The dance is tonight.
Clyde::: I'm still worried she might say no. I just wish I could see the future.
Stella::: Actually, thanks to my granny, I might be able to help.
Liam::: Your granny taught you how to read tea leaves?
Stella:::  Yup, she's the master, she saw an oak tree in her oolong tea and predicted we'd move to Royal Woods.  Cup please.
Clyde:::  Well, what do you see?
Rusty:::  I see a meatball sub.
Stella::: That's not a sub, it's Clyde, at the Valentine's dance. it kind of looks like you're wearing...  a chef's outfit.
Clyde::: Hmm... That's odd, but I do own one. What else?
Stella::: You're happy, and you're dancing with someone.  A girl with brown hair.
Clyde::: It's Emma!
Lincoln::: Now are you ready to ask her?
Clyde::: Heck yeah! And I came up with a plan based on one of my favorite movies, Il Ballo Finale. but, I'll need your help to pull it off.
Rusty::: Do we get to dress up like zombies?
Clyde::: Not quite.
Clyde::: Emma, will you be my date to the Valentine's dance?
Emma:::  I'm really sorry Clyde, but I just wanna be friends.
Clyde::: Go! Go! Go!
Howard::: What's wrong sweetie? Are you hiding from someone?
Clyde::: I'm hiding from everyone! I got rejected in front of the entire school, it was humiliating! I can never go back.
Harold::: But Clyde, isn't the Valentine's Dance tonight? You were really looking forward to it.
Howard::: And what about all those desserts you've been prepping all week?
Clyde::: I'm not going to the dance.  I resigned from the committee and gave Cheryl the number for Jacques' Bakery.
Harold::: But Honey.
Clyde:::  I don't really wanna talk about it anymore. I just wanna go home.
Antonio:::  Graziana will you go to the Valentine's ball with me, huh?
Graziana::: Yes. I would love nothing more.
Clyde:::  Dads, why are you watching this?! Please turn it off.
Harold:::  Dah, not that one.  I'm sorry pumpkin. I thought Il Ballo Finale was one of your favorites.
Clyde::: It was... until today.
Lincoln's Text::: HEY BUDDY, I REALLY HOPE U R COMING 2 THE DANCE
Rusty's Text::: WEAR U @ üê∂? U R MISSING ALL THE FUN
Zach's Text::: PRINCIPAL HUGGINS TEEPEE JUST FELL N TEH PINCH BWL
Zach's Text::: DANG AUTO CORRECT
Harold::: Hey sweetie? It's Cheryl calling. I know you don't wanna talk to anyone from school, but she said it was urgent.
Clyde:::   Hi Cheryl.
Cheryl::: Sorry to bug you Sugar bun. I know you resigned from the dance committee,  but we have got a nine-one-one! The bakery delivered the wrong cake. I'm real happy for the new mommies, but we cannot serve baby shower cake at a Valentine's dance! Is there any way you can come fix it?
Clyde::: I'm sorry Cheryl, but no.
Cheryl:::  Please? You're the only one who can get us out of this pickle!
Clyde::: Psst.  It's me, Clyde. 
Cheryl::: Ooh, I love the 'stache! It's like a little caterpillar died on your face.  Can you fix it?
Clyde::: Hmm. It's not going to be easy, but I think I can do it.
Clyde::: Ow!
Cheryl:::  It... is... gorgeous!  Do you want me to cut you a little slice for the road?
Clyde:::  No thank you. I should get going.
Cheryl::: Well, alright.  Ooh, Cheryl, what are you doing?!
Chloe:::  Clyde?
Clyde:::  Clyde? Who is Clyde? My name is Jacques, I am the baker of the cake.
Chloe:::  You're funny.  Hey, umm, I wanted to tell you something.
Clyde:::  Go ahead. You're probably just gonna tease me about my big rejection, right?
Chloe::: Tease you? No way. I wanted to tell you that your dance proposal was really sweet. It must have taken so much courage to put yourself out there like that.
Clyde:::  Oh, thanks.
Chloe::: And that Italian Cassata cake you asked her out with looked amazing! You could totally be a contestant on Operation Dessert Storm.
Clyde::: That's my favorite show!
Chloe::: Mine too!
Clyde::: So, who ended up being your date?
Chloe::: Oh, no date. I just came with my friends.  Well, I should head back to the dance,  Have a nice night, Clyde.
Clyde's Thoughts::: Ask her to dance, ask her to dance.
Clyde:::  Chloe wait!  I know the dance is almost over, but, would you like to... dance with me?
Chloe::: Yeah! That sounds fun.  I love this song.
Clyde::: Me too.  After you.
Clyde's Friends::: Go, Rusty. Go, Rusty.
Lincoln::: Hey Clyde's here!
Zach & Liam::: Hey, Clyde!
Stella::: I'm so glad you're here.
Lincoln::: Clyde! Come dance!
Chloe::: Oh, nice cabbage patch!
Clyde:::  Whoo, that made me thirsty. I'll get us some refreshments.  What is?
Cheryl:::  Principal Huggins' toupee. He's been looking for this all night.
