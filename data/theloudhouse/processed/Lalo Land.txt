Mr. Nakamura::: Let's see if you can beat me this time, Nelson! Get those legs up.  Oof!  We both earned a doggy treat!  Oh, fine, I tripped. Just you. 
Carl::: Hey, Mr. Nakamura!  Are you guys training for the circus?
Sergio:::  Step right up and see the clowns!
Mr. Nakamura::: Very funny, but no. Ever heard of Phoebe Powers?
Ronnie Anne::: Um, she's only my favorite action star-- ever!  I've seen all her movies! So, yeah, I've heard of her.
Mr. Nakamura::: Well, she's shooting her next movie in Great Lakes City, and she's holding auditions for a dog sidekick! 
CJ::: Wow.
Ronnie Anne:::  Seriously?
Carl:::  Hello, Hollywood!
Mr. Nakamura::: Yep. I think Nelson's a shoe-in!  See? My baby's a star!
Vito:::  Smoke bomb!  Big Tony and Little Sal are gonna nail the audition! They were born to be famous! 
Ronnie Anne:::  Guys, do you know what this means? If Lalo got that part, we'd get to be on set with Phoebe Powers!
CJ:::  Getting treated like stars!
Carl::: Yeah. Our own trailer, snacks, and people to boss around!
Sergio:::  And maybe they need an assistant director!
Ronnie Anne::: But are you sure Lalo is up for it?  Who could say no to this face? ¡Que guau guau tan guapo! 
Carl::: He just needs a bath!
Sergio:::  Speaking of Hollywood, I'm seeing stars! 
Ronnie Anne::: Operation Sidekick starts now. Step one, movie star makeover.
CJ::: How do we get him in? He hates baths.
Carl::: Watch this. Ahem.  Who wants bacon donuts?
Children::: Ugh! Come here! Get... come on! 
Ronnie Anne:::  Ugh, every time!
Carl::: Relax, Lalo! We're doing this for you!  Dog sidekicks get lots of belly rubs and all the doggy treats you can eat!
Ronnie Anne::: So what do you say, boy? Are you in? 
CJ and Ronnie Anne::: Whoo!
Carl::: Yeah!
Carl::: All clean! CJ, you're up!
CJ:::  Stand back!
Sergio::: Ooh, looking fly. 
Ronnie Anne::: Step two, acting lessons.
Sergio:::  I got this! Show me anger, despair, passion!
CJ::: He got a gassy down!
Carl::: I've got a better way. Lalo, just think of something really sad! It's what I do to get out of punishments!
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, he's good.
Ronnie Anne::: Now that you've got acting down, it's time to-- work on your action movie skills. 
Carl::: You'll have to be flexible!  Fast!  And strong! 
Ronnie Anne::: We'll work on that. You've got this, Lalo!
Carl::: Sheesh, Lalo's really out of shape.
Sergio:::  I'll get him moving!  Hey, Lalo, looks like your blankie is a goner! 
CJ:::  Whoa, look at Lalo go!
Sergio::: Say good-bye to your fart pillow!
Ronnie Anne::: Did you know he could do that?
Carl:::  ¡Vamos, Lalo! Finish that course!
Sergio::: You want the treats? Go get 'em!
Ronnie Anne::: Phoebe Powers, here we come!
Mr. Nakamura::: Why did you have to bite the director?  Bad Nelson! 
Ronnie Anne::: We're here for the auditions.
Chuck::: Great! You're up after those two. 
Vito::: They did that on purpose!
Director::: Next!
Vito:::  Oh.
Ronnie Anne::: Hi, this is Lalo. He's the best dog ever, and he can do anything! Run, jump, cry on cue, hit it Lalo!
Director::: Hm.  Ugh, this is impossible...  But at least this one looks like the poster.  He's hired! 
Ronnie Anne::: Look. This is so cool! And look, there's Phoebe!
Sergio:::  And there's the director!  Ahem, as a fellow director, I'd love to share my tips with you.
Director::: I don't work with birds.  Let's get those dog into wardrobe.
Chuck::: Hey, Lalo. I'm Chuck! I'll be looking after you today.
Ronnie Anne::: Did Lalo look okay to you?
Carl::: Of course. It's just first day jitters.  So you're the person we get to boss around.  We've got a list of demands! Oh, for Lalo, of course.
Carl::: You can put the massage chair over there.
Chuck:::  Why does a dog need a massage chair?
Carl::: He's a star.  Now, where are those snacks?
CJ::: Wow, check out the TV!
Carl::: Hey, there's Lalo on set!
Ronnie Anne::: Does that suit look too tight for him?
Carl:::  It's slimming. He'll be fine!
Ronnie Anne:::  Yeah, you're probably right.  Woah, this Iv has video games! 
Sergio:::  Keeping it warm for you. 
Ronnie Anne::: Wow, I've never seen so many snacks before!
CJ::: Hey, does Lalo seem tired?
Carl::: It's called acting, CJ.  Huh?  Finally, Lalo's chocolate fountain is here! 
Chuck::: I thought dogs couldn't eat chocolate.
Carl:::  You're right.  We'd better eat it all before he sees it! 
Director::: Let's go again. This time, Lalo, run even faster. Take two-hundred-six!
Sergio:::  I've been workshopping this script, called 'The Great Cracker Caper'.
Director:::  Get off my set!
Carl::: This is the best day ever!  I love movie set life.
Director:::  Bring in the angry cats!
CJ::: Huh? Lalo hates cats.
Ronnie Anne::: Hm, that's not good.
Chuck:::  Excuse me, are you Ronnie Anne? Phoebe Powers wanted me to say she's excited to see you again. She'd love to skate with you on her next break.
Phoebe Powers:::  Phoebe Powers wants to skate with me?
Chuck::: Mm-hm. 
Ronnie Anne:::  I'm sure Lalo's okay. He's a trooper! 
Director:::  Phoebe, you can take a break.  It's time for the dog's big stunt.  Hey, Chuck, is that dog strapped to the hot dog cart?  This is the scene where he rolls down the hill and jumps off at the last second before the cart goes-- kaboom! 
Lalo:::  Huh?
Director::: It's gonna be epic!  Send in the camera drone.  Start the count down.
Ronnie Anne::: Did I just hear that right?
CJ::: You're right. Abuela won't like it if Lalo goes kaboom.
Ronnie Anne::: Guys, we've only been thinking about ourselves this whole day.
Carl:::  Have not! 
Ronnie Anne:::  We have to do what's right for Lalo.
Chuck:::  Hey, hey, Phoebe is ready for your 2PM shred.
Phoebe Powers::: Hey, Ronnie Anne! Super excited to skate with you.
Director::: And action!
Ronnie Anne::: Sorry, Double P, I've got to save my dog! 
Chuck::: Whoa, hey! Hey, it's a closed set!
CJ::: Go, Ronnie Anne!
Carl:::  Whoa.
Ronnie Anne::: Lalo, you have to jump! Jump, boy, the cart's going to blow!
Phoebe Powers::: Wow, that girl can shred!
Chuck::: And shred on a dog too!
Ronnie Anne::: Yeah! Gotcha, boy!
Director::: You! You just ruined my movie!
Ronnie Anne::: Yeah? Well, you almost ruined my dog. 
Director::: What? The dog was never in any real danger. This is a movie set, kid! See all the special effects?
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, awkward. Sorry.
Director:::  You should be. You destroyed my vision! I can't work like this. I'm out! 
Phoebe Powers::: What's going on here?
Ronnie Anne:::  I'm so sorry, Phoebe. I didn't mean to mess up your movie.  I was just protecting my dog.
Phoebe Powers::: Oh, you didn't mess up anything! What you did was really cool! Ah, in fact. I have an idea for a new ending.
Sergio:::  And I have an idea for a new director!

Sergio:::  That's a wrap.
Ronnie Anne:::  Yeah, that's my move.  
Phoebe Powers::: Thanks for teaching me that awesome trick.
Ronnie Anne::: You got it, Double P!  Got to go. Lalo needs a water.  Sparkling or flat?
