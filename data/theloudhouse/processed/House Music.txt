Lincoln::: Guys! We gotta figure out something! The Family Fun Fair is tonight, and we've got nothing for the talent show.
Lynn:::  Ooh! I know! How about a family trapeze act?
Lisa::: Just because you fractured every bone from your maxilla to your metatarsals, it doesn't mean we want to.
Lola::: I know! How about a family beauty pageant?  Never mind. That would take years to prepare for.
Lana::: I say we wrestle alligators! 
Lincoln:::  Lana, that's a terrible idea!
Lana:::  You're right...  Calf roping is much better! 
Lincoln::: We need something we can all do.
Lynn::: Then let's do my idea!
Luan::: No! My idea!
Leni::: No, mine!
Lori::: No way.
Luna::: I've got the answer! Let's start a family band!
Lori::: But we literally have no musical talent.
Luan::: Yeah. I couldn't carry a tune if it had a handle. 
Luna::: As my idol Mick Swagger says, Rock and roll isn't about being the best. It's about having fun. NOW WHO WANTS TO HAVE FUN?!
Lincoln::: Uh...guys? A little help?
Leni:::  Oh. Sorry, Lincoln. 
Lynn Sr.:::  AGH! WHAT IS THAT HORRIFIC SOUND!? Is the cat fighting the possum again?
Lincoln::: No, Dad, it's us. We're starting a family band!
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, oh! You know, your old man used to be in a band. Although, it ended on a...on a sour note.
Band Members:::  Dude! Dude!! DUDE!!! You're out of the band.
Loud Kids:::  Aww...
Luna::: Well, you can be in our band!
Lynn Sr.::: Well...if you all insist.  KA-POW!  WOO! HA HA!
Lisa::: I sincerely hope that's not contagious.
Luna:::  All right, dudes, let's try busting out this jam. It's called Plastic Bag Blown Through The Gutter Of Life. Lyrics by Lucy...  ...music by yours truly. One, two! One, two, three, four!
Luna::: Dudes! Charles wants to sing lead!  Yo, Chunk! What's that? I...I can't hear you! Hold on a sec!  You guys! Keep practicing! And remember, it's not about being the best, it's all about having fun! 
Chunk::: 'Oy! Have you heard, mate? Mick Swagger's in town! He's gonna be scoutin' for local talent at the Family Fun Fair!
Luna:::  Mick...in town? This could be my big break, man!
Mick Swagger::: And now, I'd like to introduce the greatest musical discovery of my 40 year career: LUNA LOUD!
Crowd::: LUNA! LUNA! LUNA!
Chunk::: Luna!
Luna:::  Thanks for the call, brah. I've got work to do.  A lot of work.  Okay, people, from the top! This time, let's try to step it up a notch!
Leni:::  Um...I...I don't have an instrument. What should I play?
Luna::: Hm...why don't you sing backup?
Luna::: Alright, Louds! One, two, three!
Leni::: Backup, backup, backup~!
Luna::: No no no no. Leni, you don't actually sing the words Backup. You sing what's on the page.
Leni::: Oh. Got it! What's on the page! What's on the page! What's on the pa-haaaaaage~!
Luna::: Uh...rockin', Dad. Um, could you just dial it back a bit?
Lynn:::  Can't get this tuba to work-a.
Luna:::  GEO! 
Luan::: Nice tootin', sis!
Luna::: Guys, can we focus, please? We need to-  Dad! Dad!  That's it, bro! You got it!  Dad!
Lincoln::: Oops!
Luna:::  Dudes...this is the worst rehearsal I've ever seen!
Lincoln::: But...you said it doesn't matter if we were good.
Luna::: Forget about what I said, bro. Mick Swagger's gonna be at the show.
Lynn Sr.:::  Mick Swagger?! Sweet!
Luna::: No! It's not sweet! This is my chance to be discovered, and you guys ARE MESSING IT UP!
Luna:::  Dad. Dad! DAD!!!  That's it. YOU...ARE OUT OF THE BAND!
Luna:::  What?
Lori::: You literally just fired your own dad!
Luna::: I'm not gonna let Captain Cowbell ruin my big chance!  Now let's get back to work. We're gonna be here all day. So, if you guys have plans, cancel them. If you gotta pee, hold it. We really have to nail this!
Lincoln:::  What?! No way!
Luna::: All right. You're all out of my band!
Lincoln:::  No! You're out of our band!  'Cause we're gonna play without you and we're gonna have fun!
Lana:::  Yeah! And we'll pee whenever we want to!
Luna::: Fine by me. You're all holding me back, anyway. And when I'm on tour with Mick, don't call me for tickets! 
Luna::: Who needs them anyway? Not me. All I need...is a new tune.  They don't understaaaaaaaaand.... Girl's gotta have a baaaaaaaand... Time for me to go solo. You know what they say: YOLO UGH! Come on, Luna! What are you thinking? This is for Mick! You just used the word YOLO!
Luna::: Nah. Too pop-y.  Nah. Too depressing.  Nah. Too 90's!  GAH!
Luna:::  I stink and I can't write a single song Wow, there's a big crack in the ceiling Maybe I just need a change of scenery.
Luna::: Oh. Sorry, dude.
Stranger::: No worries. What are you writing?
Luna::: It's supposed to be a song. But I'm wicked blocked.
Stranger::: Maybe I can help. I'm dabbled in music myself. Have a seat.
Luna:::  You gonna finish that, brah?
Stranger::: It's all yours. So, what's going on?
Luna::: I really gotta kill it with this song. And everything I write is garbage.  I actually tried to rhyme with YOLO.
Stranger:::  Ooh...
Luna::: I know, right? You mind?
Stranger::: So, what's so important about this song?
Luna:::  I'm supposed to perform at the Family Fun Fair tonight, and Mick Swagger's gonna be there! It's my only chance to impress him! So, I gotta be my very best!
Stranger::: Oh... Wasn't it Mick Swagger who said Rock and roll isn't about being the best, it's about having fun?
Luna::: Yeah...
Stranger::: Well, when was the last time you had fun?
Luna:::  Dude! I gotta go! 
Rita:::  Ooh! Look at my little rock stars!
Lucy::: My real genre is death metal.
Rita::: SO CUTE!
Luna::: DUDES! You got room for one more?
Lincoln::: What about impressing Mick? We don't wanna 'hold you back'.
Luna:::  I'm sorry about all that stuff I said. I acted like a real bonehead today. I forgot the one rule of rock and roll. It doesn't matter if I don't play my best for Mick. All that matters is having fun. And the only time I have fun is doing it with you guys. So, what do you say? Will you take me back?
Lincoln:::  Heck yeah! It wouldn't be a family band without you!
Luan::: Grab some sheet music!
Luna::: Wait. It's not a family band yet. Where's Dad?
Rita::: The place he always goes when he's sad: the Whirl-n'-Twirl.
Luna::: DAD, I'M SORRY!  PLEASE COME BACK TO THE BAND!  IT WON'T BE FUN...  ...WITHOUT YOU!
Lynn Sr.:::  YOU MEAN IT?!
Luna:::  YES!
Lynn Sr.:::  Apology accepted!  THE BELL IS BACK!
Luna::: Mom...we're gonna need you, too! 
Rita::: Oh, honey. I don't know how to play.
Lincoln::: That's okay. Neither do we.
Luna::: But we're gonna have fun!
Lisa:::  Heaven help us...it is contagious.
Luna::: Plastic bag blowing through the gutter. Lost and alone like toast without butter!
Leni:::  Hey, guys! I'm a backup dancer! 
Lincoln::: Luna! Take a solo!
Luna::: Nah. This is a family band, dude!
Lincoln::: Yeah, but you're the only one who can actually play!
Luna::: Dad! Cowbell solo!
Lynn Sr.::: Seriously?! I knew this day would come! Okay, here we go! 
Stranger::: Hey, mate! You guys looked like you were having fun out there!
Luna::: We were.
Stranger::: And you were brilliant. You've got real talent.
Luna::: Thanks. And thanks for that little talk back at the restaurant. You really helped straighten me out. I was being horrible to my family to impress a guy who didn't even show up.
Stranger::: Oh, I wouldn't say that. 
Luna:::  Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh...
Lynn Sr.::: Hey, honey. Got us funnel cakes. Who's this?
Mick::: The name's Mick Swagger, mate! And you were great, too! I love that passion on the cowbell!
Luna & Lynn Sr.:::  Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh...
Mick:::  Are you gonna finish those?  Cheers, mate!
