Clyde::: It's nice, but I'm kinda surprised you chose a pink one with streamers and a basket.
Lincoln::: I didn't choose it, Clyde. It's a hand-me-down from Lori.
Clyde:::  This was Lori's bike? 
Lincoln:::  In a big family, hand-me-downs are a fact of life. Here, let me take you through a few of...Lincoln Loud's Hand-Me-Down Greatest Hits.
Lincoln::: There was Leni's sparkly shirt...
Leni::: Sorry. It has my initials on it.
Lincoln::: But LL are also my initials. Never mind.
Lincoln::: ...and then there was Colonel Crackers, Luan's ventriloquist dummy...
Flashback Lincoln:::  I'm thirsty. 
Colonel Crackers::: And they call me the dummy.
Lincoln::: ...Luna's electric guitar...
Luna::: Here you go, bro. All it needs is love. Love is all it needs. 
Flashback Lincoln:::  And strings, and a neck, and a body. 
Lincoln::: ...and Lynn's, um...
Lynn::: You'll thank me during those penalty kicks. 
Flashback Lincoln:::  Grody... 
Clyde::: I don't think this bike is gonna fit under your bed, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: I know. I already tried. But I definitely can't ride it. It's embarrassing.
Clyde::: Hey, look! Lori even got you a personalized plate!
Clyde:::  She's so thoughtful...
Lincoln:::  Uh...yeah...  That's better.
Papa Wheelie::: Heh! Nice bike, kid!
Flat Tire::: Yeah, that bike is so lame it...it...  ...I got nothing.
Lincoln::: You guys think this is mine? Please! This is my sister's. I'd totally show you my bike, but it's in the shop. Yep. Getting her totally tricked out. And I'm getting the brakes taken off. Because, you know, brakes are for wimps.
Rusty Spokes::: Whoa! That sounds sick!
Lincoln::: Oh, it's sick alright. Temperature of 102!
Papa Wheelie::: I can't wait to check this bike out! Bring it by the park when you get it back.
Lincoln::: Oh...uh, I...uh...
Rusty Spokes::: We'll be waiting for ya. Later!
Clyde::: Uh...Lincoln, what are you gonna do. You don't have a sick bike.
Lynn::: LOOK OUT! SICK BIKE COMING THROUGH! 
Lincoln::: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Clyde:::  About how Lori gets her hair so shiny?
Lincoln::: No, I'm thinking about Lynn's bike. I'll just borrow it for an hour, show it off to those guys, and then I'm off the hook!
Clyde::: That sounds like a really dumb plan. AND I'M TOTALLY IN!
Lincoln::: Hey, guys. Feast your eyes.
Papa Wheelie::: Whoa-ho-ho! That bike really is sick!
Flat Tire:::  Yeah...and that bike is sick, too...but not in a good way.
Clyde::: What? My parents' tandem? I'll have you know when two riders are on this hog, it could burn some serious rubber.
Lincoln::: Well, anyway, we should bail. You probably won't see me riding this again. I like to keep it in the garage so it doesn't get dinged.
Rusty Spokes::: Wait! How would you like to be our new leader?
Papa Wheelie::: Hey! I thought I was your leader!
Rusty Spokes::: Sorry, Papa Wheelie. You're out.
Papa Wheelie:::  Hmm!
Rusty Spokes::: I'm Rusty Spokes, and this Flat Tire. What's your handle gonna be?
Lincoln::: Hmm...how about Chain Linc?
Rusty Spokes and Flat Tire::: Sick...
Clyde::: Lincoln! You can't join their crew! You gotta get Lynn's bike home!
Lincoln:::  We'll call you Two Seats.
Clyde::: Okay, I'm in.
Lincoln::: Okay, guys...let's ride!
Lincoln:::   Where's Lynn hand-me-down when I need it?
T-Bone::: Sick.
Lincoln:::  Hey, ladies...
Farmer::: Nice hog!
Lincoln::: You too!
Lincoln::: You see, Clyde? I told you being in a bike crew would be cool.
Clyde::: Who's Clyde? My name's Two Seats.
Lincoln::: Sometimes in life, you just gotta take chances. You know what they say, No risk, no re-  wha?
Clyde::: What's a re-wah?
Lincoln::: My bike! It's gone! 
Clyde:::  Manny, you were supposed to watch the bikes!
Lincoln:::  What am I gonna tell Lynn?
Lincoln::: 'You see, Lynn, this bear came into the garage and rode off with your bike.' Nah. 'Dad sold your bike to pay for Lisa's new bifocals.'  'A spaceship came down and beamed up your bike.'  I'm just gonna have to tell her the truth.  Uh...hey, Lynn?
Lynn:::  Can't talk now, Lincoln. Only a few hours till the big competition.
Lincoln::: What big competition?
Lynn::: The stunt-bike competition!
Lincoln::: Are you using your bike?
Lynn::: Duh.  Now move it. I gotta brush up on my Crossover Stoppies.
Lincoln:::  I wouldn't do that. I mean, uh... when's the last time your bike had a good tune up?
Lynn:::  I don't know. Who cares?
Lincoln::: Who cares about your safety? I do. Which is why I'm gonna get your bike tuned up for you before the competition.
Lynn:::  Lincoln...
Lincoln:::  I insist! I'll be back before you can say 'Combover Sloppy'.
Lynn:::  Cross-over Stoppy.
Lincoln::: Right. Those.  Chain Linc to Two Seats! Come in, Two Seats!
Clyde::: This is Two Seats. Did you tell Lynn? Are you calling from an ambulance?
Lincoln::: No. Something's come up. We need to find Lynn's bike now! Can you come get me on the tandem?
Clyde::: I would, but my parents took it to go antiquing. They could be gone for a while. They said something about finding the perfect Amish butter dish.
Lincoln:::  Then I know what I have to do...
Lincoln::: Excuse me. Coming through.
Pedestrian::: Oh. Sorry, little girl.
Lincoln::: Hey, have you seen my bike?
Lincoln::: Have any of you seen my bike?
Lincoln::: Have you seen my bike?
Farmer::: Pink bike?! 
Papa Wheelie::: Chain Linc? What's up with that lame bike?
Lincoln:::  This heap? It's my sister's. I'm just borrowing it so I can find my bike.
Flat Tire::: Oh, right. Of course.  Hey, why are you questioning Chain Linc?
Papa Wheelie::: I wasn't.  Chain, I'm sorry. I know you would never ride a lame-o bike like that.  Let's ride, boys!
Lincoln::: Wait! I can't live this lie anymore. The cool bike was my sister's. I took it so you guys wouldn't make fun of me for riding this one...this pink nightmare with the basket and the streamers...  ...is my bike.  Phew. It actually feels good to get that off my chest.
Papa Wheelie::: That's your bike?
Rusty Spokes::: You're a joke!
Flat Tire::: Chain Linc? More like Weakest Linc!
Lincoln::: That feels a little less good.
Rusty Spokes::: You're out of our crew! Papa Wheelie, you're our leader again.
Papa Wheelie::: Yes! Let's ride, boys!
Little Girl::: You could be our leader. We'll call you Sweet Feet.
Lincoln:::  There's only one thing left to do.
Lynn:::  YOU DID WHAT?! I've got my competition!
Lincoln::: I'm really sorry, Lynn!
Lynn::: Why did you take my bike in the first place?
Lincoln::: I didn't want my friends to see me on Lori's hand-me-down.
Lynn::: Uh...hello! What do you think my bike is? A hand-me-down!
Lincoln:::  It is?
Leni::: It's true. It was my bike first.
Young Leni::: Go, bike! 
Luna::: Then she handed it down to me. I had to do some work on it, but then it was ride, Sally, ride.
Luan::: Then Luna handed it down to me, and I made it part of my act.
Young Luan::: Looks like I got a 7-10 split! 
Lynn::: Luan handed it down to me. And I turned it into the bike that you just got stolen.
Lori::: See, Lincoln? We all have to deal with hand-me-downs. We just learned to make the best of them.
Lincoln::: You don't have to deal with them. You're the oldest.
Lori::: Are you kidding me? This isn't really a tank top! It's literally the top of Mom's old girdle!
Leni, Luna, Luan, Lucy, Lana, Lola, Lisa, and Lily::: Eww! 
Lynn::: Well, enough chit-chat. I gotta get to my competition. 
Lincoln::: You're gonna ride that?!
Lynn:::  What choice do I have? 
Luan:::  You'd better not let Colonel Crackers get stolen!
Colonel Crackers::: Hey! You heard the lady!
Clyde::: Hey, buddy!
Lincoln:::  Clyde! You found Lynn's bike!
Clyde::: It wasn't me. My parents found it. They weren't as lucky with the butter dish, though.
Lincoln::: This is great! Maybe there's still time to get it to Lynn before she gets crushed in the competition!
Lynn:::  YEE-HEE-HEE-HAW!  Lynn Loud, bringing home the gold! Boo-yah!
Lincoln::: You won? That's amazing! Hey, I've got good news, too. Your bike turned up.
Lynn::: Eh, you keep it. I'm kinda into this bike now. It's pretty sick.
Lincoln::: Guys, check it out! I got the bike back and now it's really mine!
Papa Wheelie::: Cool, but we're not here for you. We're here for your sister, Lynn. Her bike is the sickest!
Flat Tire::: Temperature of 103!
Rusty Spokes::: Yeah! Lynnsanity! You're officially our new leader!
Flat Tire::: Whoo-hoo!
Papa Wheelie::: Aw, come on!
Lincoln::: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Clyde:::  About whether Lori gets her teeth whitened, or are they naturally that beautiful?
Lincoln::: No. I'm thinking that I had my turn with this. It's time to hand it down. Hey, Lana. I got a bike for ya.
Lana::: Wow! Thanks, Lincoln! It's got potential. 
Lincoln:::  Thanks to my sisters, I've got a whole new view of hand-me-downs. It's not about what you get. It's all about what you do with it.
Colonel Crackers::: Listen to what he says, kids.
