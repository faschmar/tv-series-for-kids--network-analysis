Announcer::: Player 2 wins.
Carlos::: Wham-A-Rat, I played this as a kid. Mind if we join you for a round?
Frida::: The whole familia, whamming ratas! I cherish these moments...
Penguin::: Hi, Carlitos! I'm Mr. Fluff. I want to be your best friend.
Alexis::: Oh, so close. Hey, Carlitos. Cute toy, huh? I'm gonna need more quarters.  Mommy!
Carlos::: Oh, sorry, Carlitos, but nobody wins those claw games. They're rigged.
Frida::: I think somebody needs a nap.
Carlos:::  Me!
Frida::: Aww, pobrecito.  Here's your osito. He'll make you feel much better.
Mr. Fluff::: Hi, Carlitos!  Peek-a-boo.  The real me is still inside that claw game. You have to get to the arcade and save me so we can be best friends forever, okay? But first, you'll need a disguise, to get past your family.
Mr. Fluff::: Nice disguise. Now you just have to get past your dog.
Carl::: Mom, you're running me off the road--!
Frida::: You mean my road, mijo.
Carlos::: Whoa! Must have hit the nitro.
Frida::: Oh, no, you don't.
Mr. Fluff::: Good thinking.  It's a long crawl to the arcade, you might need some wheels. 
Laird::: You coming down, Ronnie Anne? I finally perfected my move.  I call it the Laird-inator.  Come on, Laird. You got this! You just have to believe in yourself.  Wow, I'm getting some serious air! 
Vito:::  Whoa! Don't people knock around here?
Frida::: Ssh, Lalo. Carlitos is sleeping.
Carlos::: Maybe Lalo wants us to take him for a walk.
Carl, CJ and Frida::: Not it!
Carlos::: Not it.  Why am I always it? Don't play without-- meeee!
Pedestrian:::  Oh, Mother, I promise I'll bring your teapot back in perfect condition.-- Whoa!
Mr. Fluff::: You did it! Hurry inside before someone wins me.
Laird::: Yes, I did it! Anyone see that? No? 
Mr. Fluff::: You made it, Carlitos!  The only way in is through the hatch up top. 
Game::: On your mark, get set, Wham!
Mr. Fluff::: Best friends together at last.  Now we can have so much fun!  Whoa!  Help me, Carlitos!
Vito::: Hey, I got one. Ha-ha!  Who says these games were rigged?  Whoa, whoa, two for one. Must be my lucky day.  Huh, huh.  They sure make teddy bears hi-tech these days. This one even talks. 
Carlos::: Lalo, what's gotten into you? Heel!  Lalo, slow down! 
Vito::: Hey Carlos, I won two prizes in the claw machine.
Carlos:::  Uh-huh. That's great, Vito.
Vito::: Hey, Bruno. Thanks for watching the boys.  Big Tony, Little Sal, I got presents for ya. Enjoy your new chew toys.
Mr. Fluff:::  Chew toys?!  Run quick before we're dog food! 
Vito::: Sorry, boys, knock yourselves out. 
Alexis:::  Come on! Come on!
Carlos::: Lalo, where are you taking me? 
Alexis::: Oh, this just isn't my day. 
Carlos::: Ooh? Is that our diaper bag?  I must have left it behind and Lalo came here to find it.  Aww. What a good boy. 
Mr. Fluff::: That was close. Now's our chance.
Carlos::: Oh, not this again. 
Mr. Fluff::: Oh, no. If your dad finds us, he'll know you snuck out. This way. 
Mr. Fluff::: You want to give me to Alexis? But I thought we were going to be best friends.  You're trying to save me?  Aww. You really are a good friend.  I'll never forget you, Carlitos! 
Alexis::: Whoa, where did you come from, Pinguino?
Sergio::: Carlitos.  What's with the getup?  You're going to be dog food? 
Sergio:::  Pleasure doing business. 
Carlos::: Oh. You've been acting strange all day.
Frida:::  And look, you woke up Carlitos.  Aww, how's mi bebe? Feeling better? 
Carl::: Hey, Carlitos, you have a visitor.
Alexis::: Hey, Carlitos. I saw you were sad that you didn't get a stuffed animal, so I spent all day trying to win you one. Man, those claw games are rigged. Luckily, I found this one at the park.  It's almost like it found me.
Mr. Fluff::: Carlitos!
Carlos:::  Lalo, did you do this? Bad dog!
