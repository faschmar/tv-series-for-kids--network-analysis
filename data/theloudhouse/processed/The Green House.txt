Mrs. Johnson::: Okay, class, we're at the halfway point of our energy reduction project. Let's see how you're doing.  Great. Very good. Ooh! Very impressive, Clyde!
Clyde::: Thanks, Mrs. Johnson. Our house is solar powered, so we don't burn any fossil fuels.
Mrs. Johnson::: Wonderful. You're all doing a great job of reducing your eco-footprint at home. And if you keep this up, we'll definitely win the Save a Polar Bear Challenge and get this adorable little guy named after us! 
Students:::  Awwwwww...
Mrs. Johnson:::  Oh, Lincoln, I see you haven't made any progress.  What does this say? Have a heart, do your part. Do you not care about polar bears?
Lincoln:::  No, I don't! I don't hate polar bears! They're awesome!
Mrs. Johnson:::  What's that? You hate polar bears? You're a polar bear hater?
Lincoln:::  No! I love them! They're cool!
Female Student 1::: If you make us lose, Lincoln, you'll be an outcast!
Girl Jordan::: You might as well throw your social life out the window.
Lincoln::: How am I supposed to reduce our energy use? I've got 10 sisters!
Clyde::: I know! We'll just swoop in from the left and ANNIHILATE THEM!
Lincoln::: What? Annihilate my sisters?
Clyde::: Huh? No. I was talking about our strategy for the Swords and Cyborgs online tournament tomorrow. Preparation is key to victory.
Lincoln::: Oh, yeah. Don't worry. I'll be ready. But right now, I've got bigger things to deal with. You heard our class: if I don't get my eco-meter in the green, I'll be a social outcast.
Clyde::: I'll still hang out with you. In secret, of course. After dark. Speaking of which, the sun's going down. I better get home before the lights go out. 
Lincoln::: Maybe there's something wrong with my eco-meter.  Or not.  What can I do? In a family this big, our eco-footprint is a size 18 triple wide. We use a lot of electricity...
Lori::: Bobby, you look so good on all of my devices.
Lincoln::: ...fossil fuels...
Lincoln::: ...water...
Lincoln::: ...aerosols...
Lincoln::: ...non-biodegradables...
Lincoln::: ...and did I mention electricity?
Lincoln::: We gotta reduce our eco-footprint. Hopefully, I can get my sisters on board.
Lincoln::: Or not.  Time to pull out the big guns.  ...and if we don't all do our part, this adorable little guy won't survive.
Luna:::  But what can we do?
Lincoln:::  I'm glad you asked.  You don't need all of these devices.
Lori::: Yes, I do. Bobby and I like to admire each other from multiple angles.
Bobby::: Hey, Lincoln! Hola from France! 
Lori:::  Who is that girl? And why is she smiling at you?
Bobby::: Babe, that's the 'Mona Lisa'.
Lincoln:::  Instead of using all of these, why don't you write Bobby a letter?
Lori:::  Why don't I rip your little-
Lincoln:::  Polar bear.
Lori:::  Aww...okay. I'll write him a letter.  And maybe I'll write one to that little flirt Mona, too.
Lana::: But how will I keep my reptiles warm? They're cold-blooded, you know.
Lincoln::: But you're not.
Lincoln::: Instead of powering your lab with megawatts of electricity, why not use a renewable resource?
Lisa:::  Lincoln, this is genius!
Lincoln:::  Fresh energy, comin' at ya! This one's got to be good for at least 75 watts.
Lincoln::: Leni, instead of taking multiple showers a day...  ...how about using this refreshing moist towelette?
Leni::: And clog my pores?! No way!  Awww...okay.  Do you mind? I'm showering! 
Lincoln::: Luan, instead of wasting all that energy making more pies, why not get some comedy out of your leftover banana peels? 
Luan::: That old gag? I don't think so.
Lincoln:::  Whoa! 
Luan::: Actually, I'm starting to see the a-peel! 
Lincoln::: We're getting there.
Lincoln::: Almost there.  WE DID IT!
Lincoln::: See what we can accomplish when we all do our part? All we have to do is keep the house in the green until the end of the week, and that polar bear will be safe! And so will my social life.
Luan:::  Say it proud! We're green and Loud!
Sisters:::  SAY IT PROUD! WE'RE GREEN AND LOUD! SAY IT PROUD! WE'RE GREEN AND LOUD! 
Clyde:::  Lincoln! Come in, Lincoln!
Lincoln:::  Clyde, I'm not supposed to be talking on this right now. We're reducing our eco-footprint.
Clyde::: But it's tournament time. 'Swords & Cyborgs!'
Lincoln::: Oh, right. Just let me go get my laptop.
Girls:::  YES WE CARE! WE'LL SAVE THAT BEAR!
Lincoln::: What am I saying? I can't use my laptop! We've finally gone green in the house and I can't mess it up.
Clyde::: Well, there's always next year.
Lincoln::: No, no, no. I'll make it work.  One laptop won't make that big of a difference.  Whoops. I gotta get us back in the green.
Lynn::: Hey! What the-
Lincoln:::  Remember this guy?
Lucy::: Yes. We saved him.
Lincoln::: Well, he's got siblings, too. Do you hate siblings? Are you sibling haters?
Lucy::: Well, I'm starting to.
Leni::: Hey, guys! Our neighborhood's on TV!
Clyde::: Hey, Lincoln!
Lincoln:::  Clyde? What are you doing here?
Clyde::: The sun went behind a cloud. My solar house lost power. Is it okay if I play here? 
Lincoln:::  I just got us back into the green.
Clyde::: Sorry, Lincoln. I didn't mean to cause a problem.
Lincoln::: No, no, Clyde. Not a problem. I'll just go make an adjustment.  If it's yellow, let it mellow!
Lola:::  Um...what if it's not?
Lincoln::: If it's brown...keep it around!
Lola::: Ew!  Aw...
Lincoln::: Hey, guys, think we could turn off the AC?
Luna::: But we're trying to stay cool.
Lincoln::: You know who else wants to stay cool?  This guy.
Luna and Luan:::  Aww...
Luan:::  Look! I'm your number one fan! 
Lynn Sr.:::  Good one, honey.  Well, I'm off.
Lincoln::: Hey, Dad, instead of taking the car, why not enjoy a little fresh air? 
Lynn Sr.::: I'm picking up your mom from the airport.
Lincoln::: Then you'll need this. 
Lincoln::: What are you guys doing here?
Lance::: Can't play 'Swords & Cyborgs' at our houses. We're in the green zone.
Lincoln::: Well...so am I...  or I was...
Gamer 2::: Well, if it's a problem, we can go.
Lincoln::: No, no, no. I'll make an adjustment.
Lance::: Sweet! Snacks! Let's put it by the air conditioner we found outside!
Gamer 2::: But if it's not cool, Lincoln, I mean, just say the word.
Lincoln::: No, no. Adjustment.  Can't run the washer if there's nothing to wash.  What else is there?  We are in the green! Let's do this!
Lance::: Pee-yew! What stinks?
Lori:::  GAME OVER, LINCOLN!
Lincoln:::  It's not what it looks like!
Lori::: We're up there making all these sacrifices, and you're down here playing some stupid computer game?!
Lincoln::: Okay, so maybe it is what it looks like.
Lynn::: If you don't wanna give anything up, why should we?
Lincoln::: But...but...  ...polar bear?
Lola::: Aww...wait a minute! You can't use that on us anymore!
Lori::: Come on, girls! Let's go get our stuff back!
Leni:::  And a refill!
Gamer 2::: Well, I guess you're going back into the red.
Lance::: Which means you're gonna lose the polar bear challenge for our class.
Gamer 2::: Which means we can't be seen with you.
Lance::: Which means your social life is out the window.
Lincoln:::  Guys, wait! Come back! I can make adjustments!
Lincoln::: I blew it.
Clyde::: Don't worry, Lincoln. I'll still hang out with you. In secret, of course.
Lincoln::: It's not about that, Clyde. I don't care if the class hates me. What I should have cared about all along was...  ...this guy.
Clyde:::  Aww...
Lincoln::: Exactly! Our class has done their part. My sisters have done theirs. Now it's time for me to do mine.
Lori:::  Oh, Bobby. You got me a present? I can't wait to see it.
Lori:::  LINCOLN! PEDAL FASTER! I'M DOWNLOADING A PIC FROM BOBBY!
Mrs. Johnson::: Amazing work, class. We won the polar bear challenge. And I took the liberty of naming him... Mrs. Johnson...
Students:::  MRS. JOHNSON?!
Mrs. Johnson::: Let's all give Lincoln a round of applause for stepping up his green game and doing his part.
Lincoln::: Well, I saved the polar bear, and I'm not an outcast. Although, technically speaking...  my social life is out the window.  Do you mind? I'm showering!
