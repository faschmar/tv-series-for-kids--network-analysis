Lori::: Say hi to the internet!
Luna:::  I love to do nothing and hang out and waste time...
Rita:::  Ich. I'm covered in dandelions.
Lynn Sr.::: Well you look dandy, and I'm not lion. 
Lola::: Who's that? They look so...so...perfect!
Lana:::  Yeah, I'll say. Their shiny teeth hurt my eyes. 
Lincoln::: Looks like they bought the Crowleys' old house.
Lynn Sr.::: Guess we got a new family moving in on the street.
Rita::: Let's put off weeding until tomorrow and welcome them to the neighborhood. As soon as I clean up.
Lynn Sr.::: On it!  Good to go.
Rita::: Hi! We're your neighbors. I'm Rita Loud, and this is my husband Lynn.
Bumper Sr.::: Great to meet you. Bumper and Jancey Yates.
Lynn Sr.::: And I brought you a little housewarming gift: some of my famous Lynn-sagna. 
Jancey::: Thank you. How nice. Though, we really don't do dairy.
Bumper Sr.::: It makes our kids sluggish. But we could share it with the needy.
Jancey::: Oh, won't you come in?
Rita::: Uh, we won't take up too much of your time. We're sure you have a lot of un-pack-ing...to...do... 
Lynn Sr.:::  Or...not.
Rita::: Wow.  How did you do that so fast?
Bumper Sr.::: We don't like putting things off. It sends a bad message to the kids.
Jancey::: Oh, speaking of our kids...
Beatrix::: Hey, Mom and Dad. Can I borrow the car tonight? I have to be at practice and then my computer coding class.
Jancey::: Of course, Beatrix.  Don't forget to eat your protein-based snack before class, and your carb-based snack after.
Bumper Jr.::: I got first place in the State Math Bowl!
Jancey::: Great work, Bumper Jr.! You can put that in the trophy room.
Belle::: I got the internship at the UN!
Jancey::: That's fantastic, Belle!
Belle:::  And I finally nailed that tricky passage of Bach's Partita in D Minor!
Bumper Sr.::: Almost. But watch your transitions.
Beau::: Will you guys take me to my gallery opening tonight?
Jancey::: Of course, Beau.
Beau::: <abbr title=Gomawo>고마워</abbr>! 
Jancey::: He's in a Korean-English immersion program.
Rita::: Wow. Your kids sure are impressive.
Lynn Sr.::: Yeah. Is there anything they're not good at?
Jancey::: Well, we feel like they have to be well-rounded. It's such a competitive world out there.
Bumper Sr.::: If we don't encourage them to realize their full potential, we're failing them. I'm sure you guys can relate.
Rita:::  So... they were nice.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, yeah.
Rita and Lynn Sr.:::  WE'RE FAILING OUR KIDS!!!
Lana::: Where are we going? I was supposed to meet the guys at the mud hole after school!
Rita::: Your father and I signed you up for some extracurricular activities today.
Lynn Sr.::: We just feel it's really important for you guys to be well-rounded in this competitive world.
Lynn::: Well-rounded? Ho ho! You want us to bulk up?  Sweet!
Lynn Sr.::: No, Lynn. You're actually going to the learning center.
Rita::: You're great at sports, honey, but to realize your full potential, you could use a boost in your academics.
Lynn::: I'm great at math! A TD plus extra point equals 7! But if you go for a conversion, then it's 8. Boom! Math.
Lynn::: FLAG ON THE PLAY! 
Lisa::: A ceramics studio? Are we lost?
Lynn Sr.::: No, sweetie. This is your stop. You're great at science, but to be well-rounded, you need to embrace the arts. 
Lisa:::  YES, GOOD CALL! I WAS JUST ON THE VERGE OF CURING THE H1N1 VIRUS, BUT HEY, WHY DON'T I GO MAKE A COFFEE MUG INSTEAD?!
Luna::: Royal Woods Community College? What the hey, Pop Star?
Lynn Sr.::: Luna, we love your fun lingo, but to get ahead in life, it wouldn't hurt to brush up on your English?
Luna::: That's whack, brah!
Rita::: And Lori and Leni, you'll be taking SAT prep classes. That's the best way to get into a good college.
Leni::: What about just using the front door?
Rita:::  Let's book Leni for the double session.
Luna::: WE DON'T NEED NO EDUCATION!
Rita::: Life isn't all about laughs, honey. We think you'll learn more about serious matters by interning at the mayor's office.
Luan::: Well, mayor day be ruined, too!  Get it? But, seriously, I don't wanna do this.
Lucy::: Basketball?
Lynn Sr.::: We love how independent you are, honey, but when you get out into the real world, you'll need to know how to work with a team.
Lucy::: Of humans? 
Rita::: Volunteering at a soup kitchen will look great on your résumé.
Lola:::  You know what won't look great? ME IN A HAIRNET!
Lynn Sr.::: Finishing School will teach you some valuable social graces. 
Lana::: I'VE GOT SOCIAL GRACES UP THE WAZOO! 
Lincoln:::  Where am I going? A police academy? Military school?
Lynn Sr.::: Nope. You're going home. To read comics.
Lincoln:::  I knew I was your favorite.
Lincoln:::  The Senator Squad: Law Making In Action?
Rita::: Yes! These are educational comics that'll help broaden your outlook. 
Lincoln:::  So...not your favorite.
Lynn Sr.::: I'm so proud of us.
Rita::: Me too. Our kids are on their way to becoming well-rounded high achieving adults.
Lynn Sr.::: Just like their 'rents, huh? So, wanna watch that video of old people falling out of boats?
Rita::: Do I?!
Lincoln:::  Another day, another educational comic. 
Lisa::: At least you don't have to spend the day making ceramic gravy boats. 
Luna::: At least you can talk how you wanted, brah. Uh, I mean, milady.
Lynn Sr.::: Kids, where are you going? It's Saturday! Go have fun!
Lori::: Luan, that's not a duck face.  Leni, I wasn't ready!
Leni::: Say hi to the internet!
Luna:::  Doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop-doo...
Bumper Sr.::: Hiya, Louds!
Lynn Sr.::: Hey there, neighbors! Got some fun plans for the weekend?
Jancey::: Yes, we do! We're doing some volunteer work for the city: planting trees!
Bumper Sr.::: It's all about turning downtime into well-round-time.
Beau::: <abbr title=Najung-e boja>나중에 보자</abbr>! 
Luna:::  What happened to It's Saturday? The only thing I should be picking up is my axe!
Lynn Sr.::: You'll thank us for this one day.
Lisa::: But probably not today.
Leni:::  I've got mud in my mouth.
Lana:::  Lucky...
Lincoln::: I'm going to be seeing hamburger wrappers in my sleep tonight.
Rita::: All right, kids...  ...you're free to do whatever you want for the rest of the day.
Lynn Sr.:::  Guys, I just ran into Bumper Sr. at the coffee shop, and he said they're taking their kids to the symphony for cultural enrichment!
Rita::: What?! Wash up, kids! We're going to the opera!
Tenor:::  Tralala-lalala-lalala-la!
Rita::: Do they look enriched?
Tenor:::  Fortunatissimo per verità!
Lynn Sr.:::  Wasn't that enriching, guys?
Rita::: I just ran into Jancey! Her kids are raising money for schools! She says it's important to keep them civic-minded!
Lynn Sr.::: Back in the car!
Lori::: I'm really starting to not like the Yateses.
Lucy::: Hi. Are you registered to vote?
Luna:::  Bogus, dude! I mean...  ...that was rather uncouth.
Lola:::  I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE!!!
Lynn::: Can we please go to bed now?
Rita::: Of course. Jancey says kids need 10 hours of sleep for maximum brain growth.
Lisa:::  Oh, well, thank goodness for Jancey.
Lynn Sr.::: I think we earned a little R&R. You wanna watch that show where they reenact old movies with cats?
Rita::: Do I?!
News Announcer::: We interrupt Cats-ablanca for this special news report.
Katherine:::I'm standing here with the Yates family who just saved an endangered turtle.
Jancey:::  We want our kids to appreciate the importance of protecting wildlife.
Rita:::  Dang it! We didn't think about that one!
Lynn Sr.:::  KIDS, WAKE UP! WE'RE GOING TURTLE SAVING!
Lynn Sr.:::  You wanna feed him, honey? I've been doing it all week. Ow.
Lana:::  Hey, Mom and Dad. I passed Finishing School with honors.
Lynn:::  I took first in the State Math Bowl.
Lori::: We just took our practice SAT's. My verbal score went up 200 points.
Leni::: Mine, too. So, now it's 200.
Lisa:::  Behold the fruits of my ceramic labors. 13 full plate settings.
Lucy:::  I made the all-star team.
Lincoln::: We cleared the entire interstate from here to Flint.
Luna::: I tutored some new citizens in English, then registered them to vote. 
Luan:::  I helped solve the city's parking crisis.
Rita::: Wow, guys! This is all so amazing! We're so proud of you.
Lynn Sr.::: What say we take a little break and get our ice cream on? Huh?
Lola::: Sorry, Daddy. Ice cream doesn't look good on a résumé. Especially if you spill it.
Lori::: Plus, it'll literally just make us sluggish.
Rita::: Well, how about a little trip to the movies?
Leni::: I don't see how that will help us get ahead in life.
Luna::: Regretfully, I must concur. Now we must excuse ourselves to study our state capitals flash cards.
Lynn Sr.:::  No ice cream?
Rita:::  No movie?
Lynn Sr. and Rita::: WE'RE FAILING OUR KIDS!!!
Lynn Sr.::: Kids, come outside!
Lisa::: Can we make this quick? You're cutting into our well-rounded time.
Lynn Sr.::: Forget about well-rounded time. Forget about everything. Just go have fun.
Lola:::  Is this a trick?
Rita::: No. We're sorry we've been forcing all these activities on you guys. We got so caught up in worrying about your future that we forgot about your present.
Lori::: But what about college?
Lucy::: And our résumés?
Lisa::: And embracing the arts?
Lynn Sr.::: That stuff's important, but there'll be plenty of time for that. You're kids. You should enjoy being kids.
Lori::: Leni, there's a-ah, whatever. Say hi to the internet.
Leni::: AAAHH!!! SPIDER!!!
Bumper Sr.::: Hey, Louds. We're off to the postal museum.
Jancey::: Learning about the past will help our kids shape the future. What are you guys doing?
Lynn Sr.::: Just having fun.
Bumper Sr.:::  Fun? What's the purpose of that?
Rita::: Well, we think that in this competitive world, it's good to let kids unwind a little.
Jancey::: Huh. We didn't think of that one.
Bumper Sr.:::  I guess if we switch from the 12 o'clock tour to the 12:15, we can squeeze in...seven minutes of fun. What do you say, kids?
Lynn Sr.::: Hey, while the kids are playing, you wanna watch videos of old people falling out of boats?
Bumper Sr. and Jancey:::  DO I?!
