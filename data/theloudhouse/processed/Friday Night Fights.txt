Announcer::: Looks like the quarterback Lynn Loud is ready to kick off the Roosters' final drive.
Lisa::: She's in a bootleg formation, but the middle linebacker is clearly eyeing her. This... this is headed for disaster!
Lucy::: Uncanny. How did you know?
Lisa::: I do have a 180 IQ, and I have attended 20-plus games, two scrimmages, and multiple team 'pasta parties'. What did you expect?  I advise you all to avert your eyes. Including you, Randall...
Announcer::: Royal Woods gets blown out again! 52 to zero.
Rita::: I've never seen her like this. She doesn't even care that the twins are doing a deep dive on her dinner.
Lynn Sr.::: Look, LJ: round two of my cheer-up meal. Mozzarella sticks wrapped in bacon, wrapped in chicken fingers, wrapped in a cheese-steak!
Lynn::: Sorry, Pops. I'm not really in the mood.
Lynn::: If you're here to try to make me feel better, don't bother. It ain't gonna happen 'tll we win.
Lisa::: Mm... I may be able to, uh, 'help a sister out with that,' as they say. I'd like to offer your team my services as an analytics coach.
Lynn:::  Huh? Like, numbers and junk?
Lisa::: Precisely. Your play calling is statistically flawed.
Lisa::: Okay, if you run the ball against this defense, what is the likely outcome?
Lisa::: Precisely. Now, from a mathematics perspective, if you run a mid-range pass play, like a dig or an out route...
Lynn::: 100% touchdown, baby.
Lisa::: Uh, actually, 82.3444%, but who's counting? My point is, a numbers-based approach would give your team a winning advantage.
Lynn::: You'd do this for me, Brainbox?
Lisa::: Patronizing nickname aside, I cannot watch you struggle like this when I know there's a mathematical fix.
Lisa::: Salutations, athletes.
Lisa::: Welcome to today's practice. I am the new assistant coach, Lisa Loud. And I'd like to introduce you all to my associate, Touchdown Bot.
Touchdown Bot::: You all ready for this?
Lisa::: I've programmed his algorithm to access any and all football situations from a statistical perspective. As the great Pythagoras once said, 'Numbers rule the universe.'  He's also been programmed with team spirit functionality.
Touchdown Bot::: Good hustle, bro!
Lynn::: Love the enthusiasm.  Okay, you know what to do, team.  One, two, three...
Roosters and Lisa::: ROOSTERS!
Lisa::: The patting of hindquarters: an unnecessary, yet utterly satisfying, sports tradition.
Lynn::: My gut says we run a slant route to Margo.
Lisa::: Try a hook and ladder instead. There's a 91% chance it will end in you shaking your posteriors in victory. Trust the numbers.
Lynn::: Hut, hut!
Maddie::: Woo-hoo!
Lisa::: Keep it moving, people!  According to mathematical models, the optimal amount of cardio needed to-- enhance gameplay is 4.2 hours. 
Lynn:::  We need a water break, Coach!
Lynn::: So, what's the post-practice grub sitch, Coach? Wings? Nachos? Pasta?
Lisa::: Even better.
Lynn::: Uh... chalk?
Lisa::: Nutritional powder. There are 16.3 milligrams of iron in this: the optimal amount of nutrients needed to maximize performance.
Lynn::: It's a little dry.
Lisa::: Now dry off. We have an athletic competition in which to partake.
Announcer::: This is the best Royal Woods has looked all season! New analytics coach Lisa Loud has them in a tight game, but still trailing.
Lisa::: 22-X, Dream Boat, Archimedes, 91 wag!
Lynn::: Blue-22! Blue-22! Hut, hut!
Announcer::: Oh, and she fakes the throw and runs up the middle!
Announcer::: The 30, the 20, the 10... TOUCHDOWN!!!
Lynn:::  WHOO!!!
Announcer::: Wow! Royal Woods scores in the final seconds, but it's not enough. They lose a nail-biter, 24 to 20.
Lynn:::  Post-game pounds are for winners only! I thought this math crud was supposed to work, Lis'?
Lisa::: It is working.  We may not have won, but we lost by a lot less than in previous games. You can see how my mathematics approach is paying off.  At first, you were here, losing by 50 points.  Now we're here, losing by only four points. We have vastly improved. 
Lynn::: Okay, so what's next?
Lisa::: We double our efforts. I promised you wins; I intend to deliver. We're going to follow the math... to VICTORY!
Lynn::: Whoa, whoa, whoa, P. Let me help you with that.  Pad sweat...  ...helmet sweat...  ...cleat sweat?  Why is all your gear in this bag?
Paula::: Because Lisa traded me.
Lynn:::  Hold this. 
Lynn:::  Lisa! You traded Paula? She's the only punter we have.
Lisa:::  Oh, we can't be punting anymore.  Statistically speaking, we're 79.68% better off going for it on fourth down.  Trust the numbers. Oh, B-T-dubs, Margo's been traded too.
Lynn::: What?!
Lisa::: Eh... Margo is a fine receiver, but she's only 4'11. My calculations show that we could increase passing output with someone taller.  Meet Wide Receiver 1.
Lisa::: At 6'4, she gives us a giant statistical edge.
Lynn::: Uh, does she have a name?
Lisa::: I am sure she does, but 'Wide Receiver 1' will be just fine.
Lynn::: Hey, squad, just an FYI: I housed a plate of chilli cheese fries just now, so you might wanna stay away from me in the huddle.
Lynn::: Sorry about that, player I've never seen before.  Hmm? Who's this other player I've also never seen before?  Wait, who are any of you people? And where's Maddie?
Lisa::: Maddie's been traded as well.
Lynn::: What?! She was the last person on the team I knew!  ...Other than Randall the Rooster.  Oh, come on! You traded the rooster?!
Lisa::: Statistically speaking, teams with a feline mascot have a 68.45% chance of victory.
Lynn::: We got a team full of randos, and you're playing tic-tac-toe?!
Lisa::: This isn't tic-tac-toe. I've built you the most statistically efficient team in football history! The numbers say we'll win our next game by 20 points... and every game after! Dear sister, I promised you a winning team, and this is it.
Lisa::: This must be how famed biologist Louis Pasteur felt when he boiled up his first beaker of buttermilk!
Lynn::: Alright, you know what to do, team.
Lynn::: One, two, three...
All Roosters and Lisa, but Lynn::: Go Tigers!!
Lynn::: Hut hut!  How about some hustle, Wide Receiver 1?! Let's lay out for that.
Lynn:::  Oh, come on! Who was supposed to be covering my blindside?!
Lynn::: Hey, that was a cheap shot!  We don't stand for cheap shots, right team?  ...team?... 
Announcer::: Oof. Royal Woods loses, 63 to ZERO!
Lisa::: This makes no sense!
Lynn:::  I'm no Al Einstein, but I'm pretty sure we just got our butts beat! 
Lisa:::  I am aware of the proverbial posterior thrashing, and will find a mathematical fix. Promise.
Lynn::: NO! You've done enough. I put my trust in you and your numbers, and it ruined my team! I don't want your help anymore! 
Lisa::: Oh, no...  Oxytocin and endorphins...
Touchdown Bot::: ...street name, 'tears.' 
Lisa::: Mathematics have failed me!  And I have failed my sister...
Touchdown Bot::: Doctor Loud, I have been searching everywhere for you.
Lisa::: For what purpose? Our partnership has come to an end, Touchdown Bot.
Touchdown Bot:::  But what about...
Lisa::: We had a good run.
Maddie:::  Yeah, over here! I'm open, I'm open!
Paula::: Hut!
Paula::: Great catch!
Margo::: That was a perfect throw!
Lisa::: I know how to fix this...
Lynn:::  You got some nerve showing up to the game.  I told you, I don't need your help. 
Lisa::: I'm not going to help you; they are.
Lynn:::  Maddie? Margo? Paula? What are you guys doing here?
Paula::: Lisa traded to get us back.
Lisa::: I had the best roster on paper, but it turns out games aren't won on paper. The one thing my algorithm could never program was the human factor. For a team to win, you have to care about each other. I know I've let you down... so I hereby resign. But I'd be happy to be the new mascot, if that would help the team.
Lynn::: Uh-uh. You're a better coach than a mascot. Come on; we can still make this work.
Announcer::: It's a tight one, folks, with the Hockers up by three.
Lynn::: What's the final play call, coach? 
Lisa::: The numbers are saying we run a skinny post to Maddie.
Lynn:::  Actually, my gut's saying we try a hook and ladder.
Lisa::: Let's do it!
Lynn::: Blue-22! Blue-22! Hut-hut! 
Announcer::: ROYAL WOODS WINS! ROYAL WOODS WINS!!!
Lisa::: I would have preferred a victory pat to my posterior.
Touchdown Bot::: Prepare. For. Victory pat!
Lisa:::  Oh, dear...
