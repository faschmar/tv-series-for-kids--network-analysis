Lincoln:::  Lynn Loud Sr., also known as my dad. I love hanging out with the guy, but we're pretty different. So, we've had a hard time finding that one thing we both like doing.
Lincoln:::  We've tried doing stuff that I'm into, like Ace Savvy.
Flashback Lincoln::: Come on, One-Eyed Jack!
Lynn Sr.::: Uh, son...  ...my costume's a little snug.
Flashback Lincoln::: Don't worry. You're looking great. Now let's deal out some justice!
Lincoln:::  We've also tried stuff Dad's into, like cooking.
Lynn Sr.::: How's that batter coming, son?
Flashback Lincoln::: Good. Just about to mix it up.  Whoa!  Ugh!
Lincoln:::  We've even tried doing new stuff together...  ...but that didn't work out either.
Lincoln and Lynn Sr.::: Ooh! I love this show!  You do? I had no idea!
Lynn Sr.::: Okay, on three, say your favorite team. 1, 2, 3!
Lincoln and Lynn Sr.::: The Orange Iguanas!
Lincoln::: When we discovered that Legends was doing a special father-son episode, we knew we had to get on it. So we sent in an amazing five-hour submission tape.
Audition Lincoln:::  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
Lincoln:::  And sealed the deal with a tray of Dad's lasagna.  And guess what? It totally worked! We're going to be on the show!
Lynn Sr.::: All aboard, Orange Iguanas! Next stop, Orlando!
Lincoln::: Whoa! Awesome costume, Dad!
Lynn Sr.:::  Orange Iguana put yours on, too?  Now let's get a move on. I have a feeling it's gonna be a while to get through airport security.
Olmec::: Legends of the Hidden Temple, with your guide, Kirk Fogg!
Kirk::: Welcome to our very special Father-Son episode. Today's theme is the lost city of Atlantis.
Kirk::: Now, let's meet our first team, the Orange Iguanas: Lynn and Lincoln Loud.  You guys make a mean lasagna.
Lincoln::: What did you think of our five-hour audition tape?
Kirk::: Huh? Uh...didn't see that.  And now let's meet their competition, the Silver Snakes: Stan and Steak Stanko!  Who will the gods favor in today's battle? Find out when we return?
Stan::: Lasagna, huh? We got on the show by winning five Buff Man competitions in a year.
Lynn Sr.::: Well, congratulations to you both.
Steak::: Yeah. Get used to saying that, 'cuz we're gonna stomp your butts.
Stan::: Yeah. You ever see a hammerhead go after a guppy? The shark just gets in there... 
Steak::: Just to be clear, you're the guppy.
Lincoln::: No no. It was clear.
Lynn Sr.::: Ah, don't worry about those guys. We're just here to have fun.
Lincoln::: Agreed. We're not gonna let them ruin our thing.
Lynn Sr.::: Good attitude, son. Slap me some tail!  Oh. Not so hard, there. Papier mache.
Kirk:::  Alright, teams, Atlantis is sinking, and the only way to safety is by crossing the Moat in these special water shoes.  The team that flees the city the quickest gets the most points.
Stankos::: Yeah!
Lynn Sr.::: Wait a sec. Our tails! We can use them as paddles.
Lincoln::: Now that's what I call father-son teamwork.
Lynn Sr.::: Tail me about it.
Steak::: You're still in last, losers!
Lynn Sr.::: Well, Steak, that's not really important to us.
Stan:::  Spoken like a true loser!
Steak::: Ha, zing! Good one, Dad.
Lynn Sr.::: What do you think those guys had for breakfast? Jerk chicken?
Lincoln::: Zing! Good one, Dad!
Olmec:::  And so, the city of Atlantis disappeared into the ocean, never to be seen again.
Kirk::: Okay, teams, you've heard Olmec's story. He will now ask you some questions about it, and whoever can answer them will descend the Steps of Knowledge.
Olmec::: First question. Where is the lost city of Atlantis rumored to have sunk?
Steak:::  Atlanta!
Olmec::: That is incorrect.
Lynn Sr.:::  Off the coast of Northern Africa!
Olmec::: That is correct.
Lincoln::: Way to go, Dad!
Stan::: Big whoop! You got one right! Let's see you do it again!
Lincoln::: The shifting of the tectonic plates!
Olmec::: That is correct.
Olmec::: That is correct.
Lynn Sr.::: Woo-hoo!
Lincoln::: Yeah!
Kirk::: Wow! The Orange Iguanas have clawed their way back into this race.
Kirk::: Up next, Olmec's temple games. 
Lincoln::: Great job, Dad. You really nailed that Utopia question.
Lynn Sr.::: Well, you got the hard one with the tectonic plates. I almost said dinner plates.
Lincoln::: How fun is this day?
Lynn Sr.::: The best.
Steak::: You nerds made us look dumb, and the Stankos do not like to look dumb!
Stankos::: We were already cranked up to 11, but guess what's gonna happen now! WE'RE TURNING IT UP TO 12!
Lynn Sr.::: We already told you guys, we don't care about beating you. We're just here to-
Stan:::  Whoops! Where'd your hat go? Huh? Ha ha ha! Lost your hat there, fella!
Lynn Sr.::: Hey! Hey! Give that back!
Lincoln:::  You guys want a fight? You got one! You see this?  That's us cranking it up to 1,000.
Stan::: How about we make a friendly wager? Let's say, mmm, 100 bucks.
Lynn Sr.::: Yeah, well, we spent all our money at the Legends gift shop, so how about this? If you lose, you have to go through the airport tomorrow in our iguana costumes.
Steak::: Deal. And if you lose, you have to go through the airport in your iguana costumes.
Lincoln::: Deal!
Stan::: Dummy! They like their costumes. Uh...if you lose, you have to go through the airport in your undies!
Lincoln and Lynn Sr.::: Deal!
Kirk:::  It's time for Olmec's Temple Games. First challenge: the walls around Atlantis are crumbling. You must rebuild them by stacking rings on these poles. And...go!
Lincoln:::  Dad, drop down!
Lincoln::: Wait! I didn't get my ring on yet!
Lynn Sr.::: Well, I'm sorry, but we need points! The Stankos already have ten!
Lincoln::: Ugh! 
Lynn Sr.::: Son, I wasn't ready yet!
Lincoln::: Mine has to go on first!
Lynn Sr.::: The order doesn't matter!
Lincoln::: What was that, Dad? You went rogue!
Lynn Sr.::: Me? You wouldn't come down from the top of the pole!
Lincoln::: Ugh! Okay, let's just try to do better in the next challenge.
Kirk:::  Next, each team with put together a 3D puzzle representing the Door to Atlantis. And...go!
Lynn Sr.::: Okay, let's start with the edges.
Lincoln:::  Let's start with the middle.
Lynn Sr.::: The middle? You're kidding, right?
Lincoln::: No, look! I already found two that go together! 
Lynn Sr.::: You don't know that! Take 'em apart!
Lincoln::: Fine. You work on the edges, I'll do the middle.
Lincoln::: No surprise they won. Their middle pieces landed first.
Lynn Sr.::: Son, I minored in puzzles.
Lincoln::: Maybe you should have minored in listening.
Lynn Sr.::: I'm sorry, what?
Lincoln::: Nothing.
Kirk:::  In the last of Olmec's Temple Games, teams must work together to bail out the sinking city. And go!
Lincoln::: Come on, Dad! Hurry!
Lynn Sr.:::  Here comes the water. Move to the left!  Lincoln!
Lincoln::: You said to the left!
Lynn Sr.::: I meant my left!
Lincoln::: How was I supposed to know that? You need to communicate!
Lynn Sr.::: Well, if you think you can do better, you get the water!
Lincoln:::  What's the point? The Stankos are already on their third bucket. We may as well just give up.
Lynn Sr.::: Fine by me. Clearly, Legends isn't our thing anyway.
Lincoln::: Maybe we don't have a thing.
Lynn Sr.::: Maybe!
Kirk::: And the Silver Snakes win again!
Stankos::: Yeah!
Steak::: Nice teamwork, loser!
Lincoln:::  I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't mean that.
Lincoln::: I just want us to have a thing together.
Lynn Sr.::: Me too, son. Hey, maybe Legends can still be our thing. The show isn't over yet. What do you say we ignore those jerks and finish it our way?
Lincoln::: Slap me some tail!
Kirk::: The Silver Snakes are ahead, but the Orange Iguanas have one last chance to overtake them. For our last challenge, teams will run through Olmec's Temple and retrieve the Map to Atlantis. First up, the Orange Iguanas. And go!
Lynn Sr.::: Grab my tail, son!
Lincoln::: Thanks for the assist, Dad.
Temple Guard::: Grr!  Gotcha! There's no escaping me!
Kirk::: Nice job, Orange Iguanas!
Lynn Sr.::: A few goofs, but I think we did pretty well.
Lincoln::: Yeah, who knows? We might actually win.
Kirk::: Up next, the Silver Snakes. And go!
Steak::: Boom! Temple Run!
Kirk::: Wow! That's a course record! Sorry, Orange Iguanas, but the Silver Snakes win the competition!
Steak::: Yeah!
Stan::: Oh yeah!
Steak::: Yeah, we did!
Stan::: That's what I'm talking about!
Steak::: Yeah, what he said!
Stan::: We won!
Lincoln::: I didn't even see them start.
Lynn Sr.::: Aw, who cares if they won? We just ran Olmec's temple together. No one can take that away from us.
Stan::: Yeah, but you know what we can take away?
Steak::: Just to be clear, he means your pants.
Lincoln::: No no. It was clear.
Lynn Sr.::: Well, here goes nothing.
Stan::: Ha ha! Look at those losers in their underwear!
Lynn Sr.::: Keep your head high, son. Watch for incoming tomatoes.
Steve::: We saw you guys on TV! You have such a great relationship!
Airport attendant::: I wish my dad and I were that close.
Stan:::  Aw, are you kidding me?
Steak::: Come on, Dad. This is dumb. This airport's full of losers.
Security guard::: You jokers are breaking about ten security rules right now. We're gonna need to talk to you.
Lincoln:::  Well, at least we're doing it together.
