Lori::: Bobby Boo-Boo Bear! 
Bobby::: Hey, babe. Ready for an epic date? 
Lori:::  A-Truck-alypse Now...this does not sound like a romantic comedy.
Bobby::: It's better. An arena show where mutant trucks crush each other!
Lori::: Yeah, I'm literally not going to that. Why don't you take Lincoln?
Lincoln & Bobby::: What?! What will we even talk about?
Lori::: Come on, guys. You'll have fun together. I know it.
Lincoln & Bobby::: WAHOO!!!
Lincoln::: That was an awesome celebration of senseless destruction!
Bobby::: Right? Bro handshake!
Lori::: I told you you guys would hit it off.
Lincoln::: How do we end this?
Bobby::: I have no idea.
Lori:::  Boo-Boo Bear, would you get my back, please?
Bobby::: I can't right now, babe. Lincoln just got here.
Lincoln::: HEY, BOBBY!
Lori::: Lincoln?
Bobby::: Yeah. We had so much fun yesterday that I invited him to hang with us.
Bobby::: WOOOOOOO!!!
Bobby::: Sup, bro?
Lincoln::: Hey, bro.
Bobby::: Last one in the water is a loser!
Lincoln::: Hey, guys! Sorry I'm late. 
Lori::: Lincoln?
Bobby::: No worries, bro. We wouldn't start without ya.  I challenge you to a duel, Monsieur Lincoln.
Lincoln:::  Oh, it is on, Se√±or Roberto.
Lori:::  Boo-Boo Bear! I haven't heard from you all day!  You're where?  With Lincoln? Stay right there. I'm coming over.  It was bad enough when they treated me like a third wheel, but now they're hanging out without me? I don't think so! 
Lucy:::  Oh, Edwin, I'm so glad you're not like mortal men.
Lori::: Bobby, this has got to-
Bobby::: Hey, babe! Look! I won you these!  Thanks for being so cool about me hanging with Lincoln. You know, all my life, I've always wished I had a brother, and now I feel like I've got one. It's like Lincoln completes me. Sorry, what were you gonna say?
Lori::: Uh...nothing. I mean, go finish your game, Boo-Boo Bear.
Bobby::: Thanks, babe. We're still on for the county fair tomorrow, right?
Lori::: You bet. We're totes riding the Tunnel of Love together.
Bobby::: Sweet! Lincoln and I will meet you there at 5:00.
Lori::: What do I do? I'm sick of Lincoln crashing our dates, but it makes Bobby so happy. He says Lincoln's like the brother he never had.
Leni::: I know! Why don't you hang out with Bobby's little sister, Ronnie Anne? She could be like the sister you never had.
Lucy::: You know, this happens in my book. Griselda thinks she's losing Edwin, so she makes him jealous and he totally comes crawling back. Well, flying, actually.
Lori::: Ooh, that's perfect! But how do I make Bobby jealous?
Clyde::: Hi, Lucy. Is Lincoln around?
Lori::: Clyde! Am I glad to see you.
Clyde:::  L-L-Lori?! 
Lori::: Clyde, how would you like-
Clyde::: L-L-Lori!? 
Lucy::: Clyde..?
Clyde::: L-L...  Lucy?
Lucy::: I come with a message from...  ...the sister who cannot be named. Said sister would like you to join her at the county fair tomorrow.
Clyde::: I would love to accompany the lovely L...unnamed sister to the county fair.
Lori:::  YAY!
Lucy::: How are you going to make Bobby jealous with someone who's lifeless and covered in blood? Oh, wait. That's exactly what Griselda did.
Bobby::: Hey! It's my fair maiden!  Get it? Ready to have fun?
Lori::: Totes. But since three is an odd number, I invited someone to join us: Clyde.
Bobby::: That's cool. I love the Clydesdale. Hey, I'm gonna grab us all some mini-doughnuts.
Lincoln::: Great. Doughnuts for bros. Or as I like to call them, bro-nuts.
Bobby:::  Bro-nuts.
Lincoln:::  What are you up to?
Lori::: Whatever do you mean, Lincoln?
Lincoln::: I mean, this!  He's not even conscious!  Oh, wait a minute. I get it. You're trying to make Bobby jealous by dragging poor Clyde around.
Lori::: No I'm not.
Lincoln::: Well, it won't work.
Lori::: Yes it will! I mean-  I wouldn't have to do anything if you'd stop hogging my boyfriend and give him back to me!
Lincoln::: He's not just your boyfriend, he's also the big brother I've always wanted.
Lori::: Let me guess. He completes you.
Lincoln::: What? I would never say that. My point is, there's plenty of Bobby for everyone and you'd better get used to sharing him.
Bobby::: Check it. I got chocolate for Lori, powdered for Lincoln, matches the hair, bro, and sprinkles for the Clydesdale. Here you go, dude. 
Lori:::  He'll eat it later.
Lincoln::: Come on, bro, let's hit the Whirly Gig.
Bobby::: Right behind ya, bro! Babe, you coming with?
Lori::: Totes. Clyde and I will be right behind you.  You know what? We'll meet you there.
Bobby::: This is gonna be awesome! I tipped the guy to make it go faster so we get super dizzy.
Lori:::  Oh, what's that, Clyde? You want me to ride to make you dizzy?  I do that to you?  Oh, you're so sweet, Clyde.
Bobby:::  Babe?
Lincoln::: Uh, hey, Bobby, check it out. Someone left a perfectly good corn dog in here.
Bobby::: Sweet! Splitsies? 
Carny::: A winner!
Lori::: Yes! 
Bobby::: Heya, babe!
Lori:::  Oh, Clyde, thanks for winning this for me. You have such a good arm. Do you work out?
Bobby:::  What's going on here?
Lincoln::: Uh, hey, Bobby! Look! Tic Tac Toe! Or as I like to call it, Tic Tac Bro! 
Carny::: A winner! 
Lincoln:::  For you.
Bobby::: Whoa! I've always wanted a remote controlled airplane! 
Lori::: GYAH!!! 
Bobby::: Come on, bro!
Lincoln:::  Later, sis.
Carny::: A winner! 
Lori::: One cotton candy, please.
Bobby:::  Hey, babe. You never eat cotton candy off my head.
Lincoln:::  Here, Bobby. I got us snow cones. Or as I like to call them, bro cones.
Bobby:::  Sweet! Let's see who can get a brain freeze first.
Bobby::: YEAH!
Lincoln::: WAHOO!
Lori:::  Eew!  Oh, Clyde.  Here, snuggle in closer.  Oh, hi, guys.
Bobby::: Wait, babe. Are you snuggling with the Clydesdale?
Bobby::: Good call, my man!
Lori::: Hey, guys.
Bobby:::  Babe, the Tunnel of Love is our ride.
Lori::: I know, but you were off with Lincoln, so...
Lincoln:::  Bobby, look at that ride! The Toilet Bowl! Or as I like to call it, the Toilet Browl!
Bobby::: No way! Let's go get flushed, bro!
Lori::: Bobby! Wait!
Ride Operator::: Join hands, you lovebirds.  What an adorable couple.
Lori::: Oh, shut it.
Lori::: This stinks. This was supposed to be a romantic date with Bobby, and now look where I am.  No offense, Clyde. It's just...I should be on this ride with my boyfriend. But maybe I don't even have a boyfriend anymore. Bobby doesn't seem to care about being with me at all.
Lori::: Clyde?  CLYDE!
Maintenance Man::: Got him! We have five for five this week!
Lincoln and Bobby::: TOILET BROWL!!! 
Lincoln::: That was awesome! Up for number two?
Bobby::: You read my mind, Dude! Be right back. 
Lincoln::: I was talking about the ride, but that's cool.
Ride Operator::: Miss, your boyfriend's okay. He's in the medical tent drying off.
Lori:::  He's not my boyfriend...I literally don't think I have a boyfriend anymore! 
Bobby::: Alright, dude! Ready to hit the broller coaster?
Lincoln::: Listen, Bobby. We need to talk. I don't think we should hang out anymore.
Bobby::: What? No! What did I do wrong?
Lincoln::: It's not you. You're awesome. But we're not being fair to Lori. She misses you.  Be strong. We can still do bro stuff once in a while. But for now, maybe you should find Lori and take her on the Tunnel of Love.
Bobby:::  Good idea. The way you look out for others is what makes you such a great bro.  I can't right now. 
Ride Operator::: Thank you for riding the Tunnel of Love. Watch your step, lovebirds.
Lori::: Hey, Linc. Bobby told me what you did. Thank you.
Lincoln::: No problem. I'm sorry I was hogging him. Besides, I was running out of bro puns.
Lori::: Bobby was right. You're literally a great bro.
Lincoln::: You'd better get back to your boyfriend.
Lori::: But what are you gonna do?
Lincoln::: Don't worry about me. Now that I think about it, I've already got a bro: Clyde. Where is he, anyway?
Announcer::: Would the parents of a soggy boy with cotton candy in his nose please come to the medical tent?
Lincoln:::  There's my answer.
Lincoln::: Clyde, I hope you didn't feel left out while I was hanging with Bobby.
Clyde::: Are you kidding? I got to have a date with Lori! I just wish I could remember it.
Bobby::: Hey, is Lori here?
Lincoln::: Yeah. Come on in. So, are we cool?
Bobby::: Totally, dude.
Clyde::: I appreciate you being so mature, especially after the very romantic date I'm told I just had with your lady.
Boys::: BROSHAKE!!!
Lucy::: Clyde.  The sister who cannot be named would like to thank you for hanging out with her at the fair. Further, she would like you to have this gift as a remembrance of your time together.
Clyde::: For me?  L-L-Lori?! 
Lincoln::: That's my bro.
