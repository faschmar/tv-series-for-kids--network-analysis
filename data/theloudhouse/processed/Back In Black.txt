Lincoln::: There you go, Mars. Right next to your buddy, Earth.  Oh, watch out for Jupiter. He's full of gas.
Lucy:::  Hey, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Lucy! You got blood all over my school project!
Lucy::: Relax, it's fake. Sigh. Unfortunately.
Lucy:::  Hmm, needs more molasses. That'll give it just the right amount of ooze. 
Lincoln:::  Hey, Rusty.
Rusty:::  Hey, Lincoln. My parents are both at work so I have to bring my little bro.
Lincoln::: No problem. Hey, Rocky. Make yourself at home.
Rocky:::  Thanks, man.
Lincoln:::  Did you bring Uranus?
Rusty:::  Never leave home without it.
Lucy::: Gasp.  Oh... 
Lincoln::: What the?
Lucy:::  Sigh.
Rocky::: I gotta pee.
Lincoln::: Bathroom's upstairs and down the hall to the left.
Lucy::: Sigh.
Rocky:::  Hello?
Lucy::: Sigh.
Lucy::: Sigh.  I know he's not really my type. But he's so-  what's the word my sisters use? Cute.  Don't worry, Edwin. You'll always be my undead soul mate. But until we're united, it'd be cool to have someone to hang with.  You think I should just talk to him?  I knew you'd understand.
Lucy::: I see you found my blood.  It's my new recipe. Beet juice, molasses, and cocoa powder. Hmm.  Now it's got the ooze but not the splatter.  Hi, I'm Lucy.
Lucy:::  Thought you might want a clean shirt.  Just to be clear, it's my brother's.  I would never wear something so offensively cheerful. 
Rocky:::  Ah!
Rusty::: Was that Rocky? Sorry, Lincoln, you'll have to finish the project. 
Lincoln:::  What happened?
Lucy::: I keep trying to talk to Rocky but every time he runs away from me.  What am I doing wrong?
Lincoln::: Well, what are you talking to him about?
Lucy::: The usual stuff. Blood, bruises.  I didn't even get a chance to show him my new embalming kit.
Lincoln::: You know, maybe he's just not into that kind of stuff.
Lucy::: Then, what is he into?
Lincoln::: I don't know him very well but he just seems like a regular, normal kid.
Lucy::: Regular and normal. Hmm...  Regular and normal.
Lori::: Lola! Did you take my Red Riot lipstick again?!
Lola:::  No, but someone took my perfume. I bet it was Leni!
Leni::: Was not! But I'd like to know who took my pink chiffon dress, Lori!
Leni::: Where do you get off?!
Lori::: You are literally the one always stretching out my sweaters every time you borrow them!
Leni::: Fess up!
Lola::: That's my scent! I can't let people associate it with you!
Lori::: We can do this the hard way, or-
Leni::: Fess up!
Lola:::  Hang on, I smell my perfume!  LYNN! You'd better not be using my perfume to cover the stink of your hockey pads!
Lori:::  What are you doing?
Lucy::: I-I-I...I thought if I could be more regular and normal, Rusty's brother Rocky would like me.  Sorry I took your stuff. I understand if you're mad. 
Lori:::  You're darn right we're mad!   Mad you didn't let us help!
Leni::: Yeah, we've been wanting to give you a makeover since, like, birth!
Lola:::  I've been working on this Lucy vision board for years! Until now, it was just a fantasy.
Lori:::  GUYS! IT'S LITERALLY HAPPENING! LUCY'S FINALLY READY!
Lucy::: Will this hurt?
Sisters::: Too peppy.  Too poofy.  Too princess-y.  Too...PERFECT!!!
Lucy:::  Hmm...I can live with this. What do you think, Fangs?
Lola:::  Eww, eww! No more bats!
Luna::: Yeah, and do not talk about mortality.
Leni::: Or death.
Lana::: Or ask him his blood type.
Lori::: Or suggest a cemetery for a date.
Luan::: And make sure you laugh at all of his jokes. Like this. 
Lucy:::  Ha ha. Ha. Ha ha.
Lynn::: Oh, and talk about sports. Guys really dig that.
Lisa::: If all else fails, try a little of my patented pizza spray, scientifically proven to attract eight-year-old boys.
Lucy::: Gag.
Lisa::: Note to self: go lighter on the anchovies.
Lincoln:::  Who was that?
Lori::: The new and improved, regular and normal Lucy!
Leni::: AKA the future Mrs. Rocky!
Lincoln::: So, that's how you're helping Lucy? I don't know, guys. That seems like a really-
Lisa::: Oh, please. As if a male would have any insight into matters of the heart.
Luna::: You just get Rocky back here, bro.
Lincoln::: How am I supposed to do that?
Luan::: Get Rusty to bring him. Don't you guys have more work to do on your project?
Lincoln::: Nope. All finished.
Lynn:::  Not anymore.
Rusty:::  So, the dog did this?
Lincoln::: Uh, yup.  Bad Charles!
Lucy:::  OMG, Rocky. It's totes great to see you.
Rocky::: Um...who are you?
Lucy::: I'm Lucy.
Rocky::: Oh. Uh...I didn't recognize you.
Lori:::  You can't make it to mini-golf? But we already bought four tickets!
Bobby:::  Oh, um, right! Um, maybe we should...invite two other people to come?
Lori:::  What a great idea! Anyone? Lucy?
Lucy:::  I'm supposed to meet my girlfriends at the mall, but...YOLO.
Bobby::: Oh!  If only there was another guy to round out the foursome.
Lori::: You're free, right, Rocky?  Great!
Rusty:::  Any of you other ladies looking for a date?
Lori::: Just follow my lead, and remember, regular and normal.
Lori:::  Oops!  Boo Boo Bear, what am I doing wrong? Can you help me?
Bobby:::  But, Babe, you're on the Varsity Golf- OW! I mean, sure, Babe. I'll help you.  Okay, just square your shoulders and follow through.
Lucy::: Oops. 
Rocky::: Ow! What was that for?
Lucy::: I thought uh, um, uh, how about that Baseball team that played the other night? 
Lori::: Ooh.  Great shot, Boo Boo Bear. 
Bobby::: That one's for you, babe. 
Lori::: Aw! 
Lucy::: Ooh, great shot, Rocky Bear.
Rocky:::  What? I totally shanked it. My ball went down a rain gutter.
Lucy::: Ha ha. Ha ha. You're so funny. 
Rocky::: Ah! 
Bobby::: Good shot, bro. 
Lori:::  Ooh, this hole is creepy! Right, Lucy?
Lucy::: Whoa. The Freilich 2000 with crushed velvet interior. I've only seen these in catalogues. 
Lori:::  Lucy, no no no!  Regular and normal!
Lola::: TELL ME EVERYTHING! TELL ME EVERYTHING!
Leni::: Are you totes in love?
Lucy:::  No. We are totes not.
Lori::: Lucy, wait. We're sorry we pushed you so hard.
Sisters::: Sorry.
Lori::: We got a little too excited when you said you wanted to be normal and regular, like us. But you're not those things. You're Lucy Loud. You're perfect just the way you are. And we love you.
Lucy::: Sigh. There's no need to apologize. I know you were just trying to help, and I thank you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go sit in the dark. That always cheers me up. 
Lori::: Well, lesson learned: You can take the girl out of the coffin, but you can't take the coffin out of the girl.
Lucy::: Well, Edwin. Rocky doesn't like me as myself. He doesn't like me as a regular, normal girl. He just doesn't like me.  Sigh. I was a fool to think it could ever work with a mortal being. 
Lincoln::: Poor kid.
Lucy::: Fangs, bedtime.
Lincoln::: Dang it.
Rusty::: There we go. Now, as long as we keep it far away from your house, we should be done.  AH! ROCKY! YOU'RE BLEEDING! 
Rocky::: Don't worry, man. Rusty faints all the time.
Lincoln:::  Yeah, but are you alright?
Rocky::: Oh, yeah. This is fake blood.
Lincoln::: Why would you have fake blood?
Rocky::: I saw Lucy making it at your house, and it seemed kinda cool, so I thought I'd give it a try. Anyway... 
Lincoln:::  Oops.
Rusty:::  Wha...what happened?
Lincoln::: Uh...you fainted and broke our solar system.
Rusty::: Aw, man!
Lincoln::: That's okay. We can fix it at my house. I have an extra Jupiter.
Rusty:::  Your house?
Lincoln::: Well, our project isn't any safer here.
Rusty::: I guess you're right. Come on, Rock! Let's roll!
Rusty::: Done! Form a protective perimeter.
Lincoln::: Hey, Rocky, grab us some sodas from the kitchen, will ya?
Lucy::: Yah!  Oh. Hi.
Rocky:::  Uh, hi. You changed your hair back.
Lucy::: Yeah, the blonde wasn't really me. I was trying to be regular and normal, but I think I'm just gonna be myself.
Rocky::: I'm really glad to hear that.
Lucy::: Thanks. Well, see you later.  Wait. You are?  But when we first met, you kept running away. I thought I freaked you out.
Rocky::: To be honest, I thought you were too cool for me, and I couldn't think of anything to say, so I just ran.
Lucy::: Hey, uh, my coffin collection's in the basement. Wanna check it out?
Rocky::: Sure. That'd be really fun. As long as I don't have to get in one.
Lucy::: Deal.
Rusty:::  Can we stop? I'm feeling faint.
Rusty::: Easy. Ah! Watch the pothole!
Lincoln::: It's okay, Rusty. We spent all weekend on this, we're not gonna drop it now.
Lucy and Rocky::: Hey, guys.
Rusty::: Phew. Good save, man! 
Lucy::: Sorry we scared you.
Rocky::: We just wanted to tell you we nailed the fake blood recipe.
Lucy::: We also threw in a few popcorn kernels for brain matter. 
Lincoln:::  Dang it.
