Lana::: Hey, Lori? Can you take me to the dump?  All the good trash gets dropped off today. Flip's, the hospital, the hazardous waste plant...
Lori::: Ooh, sorry, Lans, I can't. I have to... uh, stay home and do homework.
Lana:::  Aw, okay. Guess I'll just dig through Lynn's trash. Sometimes there's good stuff in there.
Lisa:::  Eldest sister, where are you going?
Lori::: The mall. There’s a clearance sale that is literally calling my name!
Lisa::: But you just told Lana you had homework.
Lori::: Well, yeah. I didn’t want to take her to the dump, so I told a little white lie. No big. 
Lisa::: Mmh...  Interesting development. Lori has blatantly lied to Lana and seems to have no remorse over it.
Leni::: Hey, you guys! What do you think of my new look? 
Lucy::: Oh, uh, uh, love it.
Luna::: Rockin'.
Lynn::: It softens your jaw line.
Leni::: Thanks! Isn’t it great? 
Lola::: What was she thinking?
Lori::: Literally no clue.
Lincoln::: Yuck.
Lana::: Her hair looks like the old carpeting in Vanzilla.
Lisa:::  Mmh, more lies.
Lynn:::  Do you guys smell something nasty?
Lynn Sr.:::  Hey!  Hope you’re hungry, gang. I finally perfected my new cabbage casserole! 
Lola::: Wow, Daddy. Smells...great!
Rita::: Some of your best work, honey.
Lynn:::  Quick, ditch it before we have to eat the fish sauce!
Lisa:::  The lies continue.
Lisa:::  I fear for my family's wellbeing. Truth is the foundation of any functioning society, whereas lying can only lead to chaos and ruin. I must rectify this problem.
Luna:::  Just tell me where it is, brah!
Luan:::  Well, I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about!
Lisa::: Hm, what seems to be the problem here?
Luna:::  Luan's always borrowing my gong to punctuate comedic moments and now it's missing! I know she took it!
Luan:::  No, I didn’t!
Lisa::: Luna, you’re right. Luan is lying.
Luan:::  No, I’m not!
Lisa::: Oh, yes you are. Behold, my latest invention:-- lie-detecting glasses.  They allow me to track micro-expressions, pulse, pupil dilation, and perspiration to determine untruths. This family is guilty of excessive lying, and I must correct the problem before it's too late. 
Lynn Sr.:::  All right, which one of you water buffalos destroyed the bathroom?
Lynn:::  Wasn’t me, Dad.
Lisa:::  That’s a lie.
Rita::: So, what'd you think of the new chapter?
Lucy::: Umm... I really liked it.
Lisa:::  Fib.
Luan::: Ooh! It’s beautiful, Lily. I love it!
Lisa:::  Untruth.
Lori::: Leni, there’s no hot water left! Did you take another 40-minute shower?
Leni::: No. I was in there, like, five minutes.
Lisa::: Brazen falsehood.
Lisa:::  Greetings, family. Can I help you?
Lola::: You sure can.  You can STOP using your TERRIBLE GLASSES!
Lori::: They’re literally driving us crazy!
Lisa::: Look, I'm simply doing what's best for this family. Every lie drags us closer to chaos and ruin.
Rita::: Sweetie, I agree, but sometimes a little white lie helps smooth things over.
Lisa::: I firmly disagree. There's no such thing as a good lie. 
Lynn Sr.:::  Okay, it's clear what we have to do.
Lincoln::: Tell the truth?
Lynn Sr.::: No! Destroy those ding-dang glasses!
Lisa::: Ahem.  Anyone care to explain this? 
Lola:::  Are those your special glasses?
Rita::: Oh, I feel so bad!
Camera::: Lie! Lie! Lie!
Rita:::  What is that?!
Lisa::: I anticipated pushback to my effort to stamp out lying, so I created a backup system of lie-detecting cameras.  You'll find them conveniently located in every room of the house.
Lynn:::  Not for long! 
Lisa::: I anticipated this as well. Hence the protective shields.
Luna::: This isn't right, dude, you can't just force this on us.
Lisa::: It may sting at first, but eventually you'll see I'm doing this for your own good. 
Lisa::: A new day, a new chance to restore truth to the Loud House.
Leni::: Hey, Lincoln, what do you think of my new haircut?  I went to this new place where they cut your hair in under three minutes, or it's free.
Lincoln::: Um, it's great. You look amazing.
Camera:::  That's a lie.
Leni::: You don't like it?
Lincoln:::  Uh, I mean, it's not terrible.
Camera:::  He is still lying through his chipped teeth.
Leni::: Just tell me the truth, Lincoln!
Lincoln:::  Okay, okay, it's the worst haircut I've ever seen! There's bald patches everywhere, and then just this random rat tail in the back.
Leni:::  Ugh! 
Lisa::: Excellent. This is why the truth is important. Now that Leni knows her hair looks awful, she can remedy the situation.
Rita::: So, don't keep me in suspense. What do you think?
Lucy:::  Maybe we should talk in the car.
Lisa:::  I also installed cameras in Vanzilla.
Lucy::: Fine, it's boring, Mom. You spent ten pages describing a garden.
Rita:::  That was supposed to be a metaphor, but fine.
Lisa:::  Harsh, but every writer does need truthful feedback.
Lana::: Hey, Lori, are you free? I need a ride to the dump. On Thursdays, the hair salon throws out the extra hair, and it makes the perfect stuffing for a beanbag chair! If you can tolerate the smell.
Lori::: A ride? Uh, well, uh...  Technically, yes, I am free to give you a ride.
Lana:::  Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Lori:::  Come on.
Lisa:::  Mm-hmm. Well, it seems as though everything is on track. And now, as everyone continues to tell the truth, it's time for my midday cellular rejuvenation. Street name: nap.
Luan::: I re-gifted your present to Pop-Pop.
Leni::: I laughed, but I don't get it.
Lola::: Your bedtime stories feel... phoned in.
Lynn::: Your poems are the worst.
Lucy::: Your breath smells like the undead.
Lynn Sr.::: I can't remember your middle name.
Rita::: I wasn't still at work, I was hiding in the laundry room, eating pudding.
Lisa::: Apologies for my tardiness, family. I was having quite the REM cycle.  So, what's on the menu, Father?
Lynn Sr.:::  Cabbage and fish sauce! Back by popular demand!  Hey, what's the matter? Are-are-aren't you guys hungry?
Lana::: Dad, I hate to say this, but thanks to Lisa, we have no choice. This dish is gross, and not in a good way.
Luna::: It's super gnarly.
Lola::: It smells like Walt's bird cage.
Lynn Sr.::: But, but the other night, you all-
Rita::: We didn't like it then either. After you went to bed, we ordered takeout.
Lynn Sr.:::  Well, have fun eating cereal for dinner! 
Lisa:::  So, Luan, got any jokes to liven this dinner up a little?
Luan::: Well, since some people find my jokes pretty forced, I rather not.
Lisa:::  Mother, any compelling work stories?
Rita::: Some say my voice makes them zone out, so I'll pass.
Lisa::: Okay... Uh, uh, Lori, how about treating us to some juicy gossip?
Lori::: Oh, I wouldn't want to annoy anyone with my stories that go on and on.
Lynn:::  Ugh, I'm outta here! Lost my appetite.
Camera:::  That is false. You still have it.
Lynn:::  Fine, I'll eat in my room!  
Luna::: Me too!
Leni::: I totes can't believe you would say that to me!
Rita::: I probably don't eat cool enough!
Lisa:::  I admit eating alone isn't ideal, but I still think this is for the best.
Camera:::  Lie.
Lisa::: No, it isn't! I'm doing my family a service and I'm certain they'll thank me someday.
Camera:::  False. You no longer believe that.
Lisa:::  Okay, fine, you're right. This experiment has been a disaster. I thought enforcing honesty would save my family, but instead, it brought them to ruin.
Camera::: Talk about irony.
Lisa::: Attention, family! Could you please gather in the living room?
Lynn:::  What now? Did you make fart-detecting glasses?
Lisa:::  No. Listen, I wanted to apologize for subjecting you to my experiment. While I still think the truth is best... I see now that little white lies do help maintain social harmony.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, thank goodness.
Lucy::: That's a relief.
Lana::: No backsies.
Lisa::: So, with no further ado, I will now destroy the cameras. Father, a boost, please?  Only a few hundred of these to remove.  Ah, yes, I forgot they're protected with military grade self-defense systems.
Lincoln::: Oh no! Are we stuck with them forever?
Lisa::: Hmm...  There may be another way. 
Lisa::: Okay, everyone ready? Commence.
Lynn:::  One plus one is six!
Camera:::  That is a lie.
Lana:::  The moon is made of blue cheese!
Camera:::  Falsehood.
Lori:::  The Earth is literally flat!
Camera:::  Fabrication.
Lola::: Unicorns are real!
Leni::: I tots hate Fashion!
Camera::: Lie. Fib. Whopper. Doozy. Fiction. Fable. Disinformation. Prevarication. System overload.
Lisa:::  And that's how you do it.
Lynn Sr.::: Whew! All that fibbing worked up an appetite.  Who's up for some of Dad's famous squid ink surprise?!
Lisa::: Ummm, Father... that sounds delightful.
Lynn Sr.:::  Whee! Coming right up! 
Lincoln::: Now you're getting the hang of it.
Rita:::  I'll get the takeout menus.
