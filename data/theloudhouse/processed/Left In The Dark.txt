Hunter Spector::: Do you believe in ghosts? Join me, Hunter Spector, spectre hunter, leader of the Academy of Really Good Ghost Hunters, or ARGGH! As I descend into the scariest place in any home, the basement! Sunday night at 8 PM! Don't miss it, or you'll be left in the dark! ARGGH!
Lincoln::: It's finally here! The live season finale of the greatest show ever!  All right, I know you're probably saying to yourself, Lincoln, with ten sisters, there's no way you're going to get to watch your favorite show. And, you'd be right. Every Sunday at 8, it's the same thing.  But tonight, I have a plan.  Cadet Lincoln calling Cadet Clyde, do you read me?
Clyde::: This is Cadet Clyde, I read you loud and clear! I'm so excited! We finally get to watch ARGGH! together. And by together, I mean you at your house, and me at mine, right?
Lincoln:::  For such a landmark event, we decided that it'd be best for us if we watched it separately. Clyde's got a huge crush on my sister Lori. It gets awkward.
Clyde:::  Hubba hubba.
Lincoln::: Clyde? Clyde? Do you read me?
Clyde::: Uh, you better hurry, Lincoln. It's almost 8:00!
Lincoln::: It's time to put Operation Distract My Sisters So That I Can Get to the TV First and Watch the Special Live Season Finale of ARGGH! and Think of Shorter Name For This Operation into action.
Lola and Lana:::  Cartoons! Cartoons! Cartoons! Cartoons!
Lincoln::: Did someone say tea party? 
Lola::: Eeeee! Thank you, Lincoln! 
Lana:::  Hey, I don't want to be part of some dumb old tea party, I want to watch TV!
Lincoln::: Not even if these guys are invited? 
Lana::: Eeeee! Thanks, Lincoln! 
Lincoln::: Hey, Luan!
Luan::: I was just heading downstairs to watch TV.
Lincoln::: You might want to grab your video camera instead. The twins are at it again.
Lola::: You can't! You cant! V.I.P. only!
Luan::: This is totally gonna go viral!  Thanks, Linc!
Lola::: Ow. Ow!
Lincoln::: Hey, Lisa. I saved you a trip downstairs and got that stuff you needed.
Lisa::: The lactose, Triticum protein, sodium chloride crystals, sucrose, and gallus gallus ovum?
Lincoln::: Uh, you mean milk, flour, salt, sugar, and eggs? 
Lisa::: You say tomato, I say Solanum Lycopersicum. Thank you. 
Lynn::: Yeah! Two minutes to game time! Whoo!
Lincoln::: Hey, Lynn, check it out.  I filled it with helium for the extreme player who demands more.
Lynn::: I demand more!
Lincoln::: Uh, go long!
Lynn::: Get over here, you!
Lincoln::: Oh my gosh, Leni!
Leni::: What? Is there a spider on me?!  Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
Lincoln::: Worse. There's a zit on the end of your nose!
Leni::: I'm a hideous monster! 
Luna::: Hey, bro! TV tonight is gonna be rockin'!  Yeah!
Lincoln::: Or, you can have your very own flashlight rock show in your bedroom. 
Luna::: That is sweet! Thanks, Linc! 
Lori::: Has anyone seen my phone? I need to live-tweet my show!
Lincoln:::  Hey, Lori! Hey, Lori, I found your phone!
Lori::: Give me that!  How many times do I have to tell you to keep your hands off my stuff!  Hello? Oh, hi Bobby.  No, I didn't text you to call me, but I'm glad you did!  Thanks for nothing, twerp!
Lincoln::: And that makes 10.  Like I said, I might not be the fastest, and I might not be the strongest, but to get all of my sisters out of the way, it pays to have a plan.
Lucy::: You forgot me.
Lincoln::: Ahh!  Lucy! I always forget about Lucy!
Lucy::: Story of my life.
Lincoln::: What are you doing here?
Lucy::: It's the season premiere of my favorite show, Vampires of Melancholia.
Lincoln::: This is the episode of ARGGH that everyone is going to be talking about at school tomorrow! Please let me watch it? Pretty please with a black cherry on top?
Lucy::: I'm sorry, Lincoln, but you know the rule. I was here  first.
Lincoln::: NOOOOOO!  Ha!
Lucy:::  That's the old remote that Lily threw into the toilet.
Lucy::: Sorry, Lincoln, I can't miss my vampires. Edwin is so cold and tormented and mysterious. Sigh. If only he wasn't from another century.
Lincoln::: Another century! That's okay, Lucy. You watch your show on the big color TV. I'll just go watch my show on Dad's crummy, old, black-and-white TV.
Lucy::: Black and white are my favorite colors.
Lincoln::: Yeah, it'll make watching my show a little bit more... spooky!
Lucy::: Spooky is also my favorite color.
Lincoln::: Well, enjoy your vampires.
Lucy::: Wait! I'll take the old TV!
Lincoln::: How can only two colors be so heavy?  Here you are. Now to plug it in. So, you can be happy or sad or whatever that emotion is. And I won't be left in the dark.  Dang it.
Lori::: All right! All right! Everybody just calm down!
Leni::: Guys! I can't see anything! I think I've gone blind!
Lori::: No, you didn't go blind. What the heck happened?
Lincoln::: I was just plugging in the old TV for Lucy and it must've made the lights go out.
Lori::: Of course it was your fault, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: What? All I did was plug in some dumb old TV!
Luan::: Hey! I know why the lights went out! Cause they liked each other!  Get it? Get it?
Lisa::: That one was so good, it deserves a cookie. 
Luan::: Oh, thanks.  So anyway, what did one light bulb say to the other? 
Lincoln::: You're glowing.
Luan::: Oh. I already told you that one?
Luna::: No, dude. You are glowing.
Luan:::  Hey, wow!
Lori::: Everyone back away from Luan.  Lisa, Mom and Dad said you're not allowed to use your siblings as experimental guinea pigs anymore!
Leni::: Yeah! Not after what you did to me!
Leni::: My face feels funny.
Lisa::: Classic. All I did was infuse the bioluminescent DNA of the Aequorea victoria jellyfish into a cookie. I call them Gloweos. Besides, now we can see.
Lori::: Okay. Everyone huddle around Luan.
Luan::: I always knew I was the light of your life. 
Lincoln::: Okay. So, how about we get that power back on.
Lori::: Hey, when Mom and Dad are out, I'm in charge. So first, we need to get a head count to make sure we're all here.
Lincoln::: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and me, that's 11. Yep, that's all of us. We are all here and accounted for.
Lucy::: You forgot me.
Lincoln::: Can I go flip the circuit breaker and get the lights back on before Lucy gives me a heart attack?
Lori::: Again, in charge. I'll do it. Where's this circuit breaker thingy?
Lincoln::: In the basement.
Lori::: Why am I the one who has to do this?
Lori's Siblings:::  Because you're in charge!
Lori::: All right, all right! Come on, Luan. Light the way.
Luan::: That's the brightest idea you've had all day!  Oooh. I thought I was staying in tonight, but I guess I'm going out! 
Lori::: Lisa, give her another one of those cookies. We won't tell.
Lisa:::  Negative. That was the only one. Prototype.
Lori::: Just great...  There's something in the basement! I'm not going down there!
Lynn:::  Ooh! You're scared of the dark!
Lori::: I am not! You're the one who's scared.
Lynn::: I'm not afraid of anything.
Lucy::: Boo.
Lynn::: AAH!
Twins::: THERE'S A GHOST IN THE BASEMENT!!! 
Lincoln::: Guys! I'm running out of time! It's really important that I...I...I...  ...fix this. OKAY, QUIET!  Come here, you two. It's okay. There's nothing to be afraid of.  Your big brother will protect you. In fact...I will protect all of you! For I am Cadet Lincoln! Highly trained student of the Academy of Really Good Ghost Hunters! Or...ARGGH!  Cadet Clyde, this is Cadet Lincoln. Forget the plan. I'm going to need backup.
Clyde::: Cadet Clyde, reporting for duty.  L-L-L-Lori?  RED ALERT. RED ALERT. DOES NOT COMPUTE. CIRCUIT OVERLOAD. MUST ABORT MISSION. 
Lincoln:::  I told you it gets awkward.  I will now descend into the scariest place in the house: the basement. But fear not, with my official ARGGH! branded night vision goggles, I can see in the dark. 
Lori::: Lincoln, are you okay?
Lincoln::: The bad news is, my goggles are just a toy and do not really see in the dark! The good news is, they cushioned my face from the hard basement floor!
Luan::: Hey! I think my video camera has a night vision setting.
Lincoln:::  Sweet!  It's just like the cameras they use on ARGGH! I'm going in.
Lori::: Wait! You're not leaving us up here all alone, are you? I mean, we couldn't possibly let you go down there all alone. We should all go down together. As a group. 
Lincoln::: Very well. I'll lead the way.
Lincoln::: You may want to stay close. There's no telling what could be lurking down here in the dark.
Luan::: There's nothing funny about this situation. Although, I do like dark humor.
Leni::: Is someone touching my hand?
Lynn::: You're touching your own hand.
Lori::: I hate basements.
Lori:::  What's that moaning?!
Lincoln::: Don't freak out. It's just the pipe settling.
Leni::: What's that scratching?!
Lincoln::: Don't be scared. It's just Cliff the Cat.
Lynn:::  What is that smell?!
Lincoln::: It's just Lily with a full diaper.
Lily:::  Poo-poo!
Lincoln::: See, guys? I told you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Lori::: What is it?!
???:::Lincoln...LINCOLN...
Lincoln:::  IT'S A GHOST AND IT KNOWS MY NAME!
Lincoln:::  I'LL SAVE YOU, SISTERS! 
Lincoln::: Hi-yah! Take that, evil spirit!
Lori:::  Cool it, Lincoln. It's not a ghost. It's just our laundry.
Clyde:::  Lincoln! Lincoln! Do you read me?
Lincoln:::  Clyde?
Clyde::: I was just calling to say sorry for not being such a good ARGGH! cadet. And is your sister ready to date younger men?
Lori::: Never gonna happen!
Clyde::: Was that your sister?!  RED ALERT. RED ALERT. OVERLOAD. OVERLOAD.
Leni:::  Guys! I still can't see!
Lisa::: Open your eyes.
Leni:::  IT'S A MIRACLE!
Lori::: First one to the TV is couch commando.
Lincoln::: I can still get there first!
Hunter::: WOW! That was by far the best episode of ARGGH! ever! I'd hate to be you if you missed it!
Lincoln:::  NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  I can't believe I missed my show...
Lori:::  Sorry you missed your show, Lincoln.
Luan::: But you just lived it. Check it out. 
Lincoln:::  You know, I may have missed my show. But sometimes, it's not about being there first. Sometimes, it's about being there together. All of us.
Lucy::: You forgot me.
Siblings:::  AAAHH!!!
