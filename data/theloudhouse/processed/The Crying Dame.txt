Lisa::: Negative, it's clean.
Rita::: Hey guys, how's it going?
Lynn::: Terrible. Lily's been crying for an hour, and we can't figure out why.
Lincoln::: Yeah, we've tried everything to get her to stop.  She's not hungry, gassy, or sleepy! She has her blankie, and her giraffe!
Rita:::  Well, sometimes, babies just cry and you don't know the reason. Oh, it's okay, sweetie.
Lynn Sr.::: You guys did plenty of crying when you were babies, trust me.  Except Lucy. She just...stared at us.
Rita:::  Yeah. That's why we grew her bangs out.
Lucy::: I can still see you.
Rita::: Anyway, try to have a little patience with Lily, kids. She'll stop crying when she's ready.
Leni::: I guess you're right. We'll just learn to live with it.
Lola:::  Speak for yourself.
Lisa::: Yes, her caterwauling is unbearable.
Lincoln::: We need a plan.
Lori:::  I've got it! 
Lincoln::: Leaving is not a plan!
Lori:::  No. Fenton the Feel-Better Fox. My favorite toy when I was a baby. He always cheered me up.
Lori::: Aha! I found him!  Look, Lily. This is Fenton. 
Fenton:::  Cheer up, baby, don't you cry. No more tears, it's cheer-up time. Laugh with me and we will be. Happy happy happy
Lily::: Fa-fa. 
Lincoln::: Yes! It worked!
Fenton::: Cheer up, baby, don't you cry. No more tears, it's cheer-up time. Laugh with me and we will be. Happy happy happy
Lynn Sr.:::  The Demon Toy! I thought you got rid of that!
Rita::: I thought you did!
Lynn::: What's the big whoop? We got Lily to stop crying. You're welcome.
Rita::: You don't understand! That horrible fox drove us so crazy, we almost didn't have any more children!
Lisa::: Well, you certainly went the other way with that.
Lynn Sr.:::  Come on, honey. We'd better go soundproof our room.
Luna::: Dudes, overreact much? It's just a cute little toy.
Rita:::  It's cute now, but you'll see! YOU'LL ALL SEE!
Lola::: Pfft. They're just jealous that we're the ones who got Lily to stop crying.
Lily::: Fa-fa. 
Fenton::: Cheer up, baby, don't you cry. No more tears, it's cheer-up time. Laugh with me and we will be. Happy happy happy
Lori::: Wait, you guys, no!
Lola:::  Three nights of torture! I cannot lose any more beauty sleep!
Leni:::  I was so tired last night, I fell asleep in the middle of cutting Lori's hair.
Lori:::  What?! 
Lincoln::: Mom, Dad, you were right. We admit it. Fenton is destroying our lives.  Mom? Dad?
Lynn Sr.:::  OH! WHEN DID YOU KIDS WAKE UP?
Lola::: You guys, I hate to say it, but we have no choice. THE FOX MUST GO! Actually, I didn't hate saying that.
Lincoln::: Okay, people, we are ready to commence Operation Freedom From Fenton the Feel-Better Fox. Here's a run-down of Lily's daily schedule.  Coloring, feeding, bathing, napping, chewing on books. As you can see, she always has Fenton with her. But there is one exception: diaper change time. During this approximately 47-second window, Lily will be separated from the Demon Toy. That's when we strike.  It's a tough mission, and some of you might not come back, but rest assured that your sacrifice will-  Hey! I did not say fall out!
Luan::: Okay, Lily, you know what time it is!
Lisa::: Okay, Lynn, go!
Lily::: Fa-fa?
Lincoln::: Now for Phase Two: Operation Keep Lily From Crying. Go, go, go!  Okay, here's the moment of truth. If Lily can go to sleep without you-know-who, we've done it.  Well, team, I'm proud of you all. It was touch-and-go there for a while, but you believed in yourselves, and more importantly, you believed in each other.  Dang it.
Lola:::  I finally got some beauty sleep. Oh yeah! I am back!
Leni::: I slept so well, I got up early and made Lori these extensions.  Now I just need a stapler.
Lori:::  I'll take it from here. 
Siblings minus Luna:::  Good morning, Lily!
Leni::: What's wrong, sweetie? You look a little grumpy this morning.
Luna::: She's probably just hungry, dude.
Leni:::  Open the airplane. Here comes the tunnel. 
Lincoln::: Oh. Well, she must not be hungry. Maybe she wants to play.  Lily, wanna help me build a castle?
Luan:::  How about I make you a dinosaur?
Lana:::  I know, Lily. Let's build a fort.  Okay, Lily, come on in. But no pooping.  Lily? Lily?
Lily::: Fa-fa... 
Leni::: OMGosh, you guys, that's why she's been so sad this morning. She misses Fenton.
Lincoln::: We didn't make her forget about Fenton. We just kept her from crying.  Guys, I know we've been loving the peace and quiet, but it's not worth it if our baby sister is sad.
Lola::: I hate to say it, but we have to get that fox back. I really did hate saying that.
Lana:::  Sorry, guys. No Fenton. This thing is empty. But I did find a girlfriend for Bitey. 
Luan::: Shoot. The garbage truck must have already come.
Lincoln::: To the dump!
Lori::: This place is literally huge. How are we ever going to find a little toy in all this trash?
Lincoln::: That's how! Follow that annoying song!
Loud Kids::: NO!!!
Loud Kids::: Dang it.
Lynn::: We're officially the worst siblings ever.
Leni::: Poor Lily. She'll probably grow up super gloomy, dress in black, and listen to sad music all the time.
Lucy:::  We can only hope.
Lola::: Ugh! Stop singing that!
Luna::: Sorry, dude. It's stuck in my head. Say what you want about that fox, but his tune has a wicked hook.
Lori::: It's kinda stuck in my head, too.
Lucy::: Mine, too.
Lisa::: It's also rebounding in my cerebellum.
Lincoln:::  Wait. You guys! Maybe there is a way to give Fenton back to Lily.
Lily:::  Fa-fa?!
Luna::: Cheer up, baby, don't you cry. No more tears, it's cheer-up time. Laugh with me and we will be. Happy happy happy
Lily:::  Fa-fa!  Fa-fa! Fa-fa! Fa-fa!
Lincoln:::  Well, we might be doing this for the rest of our lives, but at least Lily's happy again.
Lily:::  Fa-fa! Fa-fa! Fa-fa!
Lily's siblings::: Cheer up, baby, don't you cry. No more tears, it's cheer-up time. Laugh with me and we will be. Happy happy happy
