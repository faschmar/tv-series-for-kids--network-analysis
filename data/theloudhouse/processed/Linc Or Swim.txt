Lincoln:::  Ah! On a hot summer day, there's nothing like a refreshing dip in the community pool.  CANNONBALL!
Lifeguard::: Loud family, out!
Lynn::: But we were just having fun.
Lifeguard::: Chicken fights during Senior Swim are not fun.
Mrs. Jelinski:::  I just replaced this hip!
Lincoln:::  On a hot summer day, there's nothing like a refreshing dip in the community pool... one town over.  CANNONBALL!
Lifeguard::: Loud family, out!
Lana::: But we were just having fun.
Lifeguard::: Drinking pool water is not fun.
Lana::: But it tastes like chicken noodle soup.
Lifeguard::: Fine, but did you have to add the celery and carrots?
Lincoln::: On a hot summer day, oh, you know the rest.  CANNONBALL!
Lifeguard::: Loud family, out! 
Lori::: But we were just having fun.
Lily::: Poo-poo.
Lifeguard::: Fecal incidents are not fun.
Lori::: Come on, guys. We'll just find another pool.
Lisa::: Actually, we've been suspended from every aquatic recreation center within a 60-mile radius.
Lori::: Seriously? How are we gonna keep cool now?
Lincoln::: So that's it, then. No more pool for the Louds.  That's it! 'Pool for the Louds!' Why didn't I think of that sooner? 
Lincoln::: Whoa. The perfect family pool. Just imagine...
Lincoln::: On a hot summer day, there's nothing like a refreshing dip in your own pool.  CANNONBALL!!! 
Lola::: Ah ah ah! Don't you dare splash me, Lincoln Loud! This outfit cannot get wet.
Lincoln::: But it's a swimsuit.
Lola:::  It's a swim gown, you Philistine.
Lana:::  Mama's little baby loves shortenin', shortenin 
Lynn::: Who whats to chicken fight?
Leni:::  I'm in!
Lana::: Mmm...just what my soup needs...
Lincoln::: I can't even get into the pool in my own fantasy!
Lori::: FECAL INCIDENT!
Lincoln::: NOOOOOOOOO!!!
Lincoln::: Maybe not so perfect.  Oh! Paradise for One. Just imagine...  Now this is a pool I can really get into.  Lincoln's little baby loves shortenin', short-  Whoops. Gotta pay first. 
Leni::: Hey, Linc. Wanna chill with us?
Luan::: 'Chill'! Good one, Leni! 
Leni::: Good what?
Lincoln::: Thanks, but I don't mind the heat. But, uh, you guys keep cool in here. Definitely no reason to go outside. I wouldn't even bother looking out there. Am I talking too much? I feel like I'm talking too much. 
Lisa::: He's clearing suffering the first symptoms of heat stroke. Now, pass the frozen succotash.
Lana::: Scoot over. You're melting the broccoli.
Lola::: Well, stop breathing on the frozen carrots!
Luan::: Hey, Lynn, can you grab that bag of peas? Peas and thank you! 
Lincoln:::  Phew.  The manual? Psst. Who needs the manual?  What the?  Ah, the manual. Everyone needs the manual. 
Lincoln::: Whoops.  I guess it's just you and me now.  Ouch! My sunburn!  Oh, no, you don't...  I sure showed that bee.  Dang it.
Lincoln::: Ouch! My sunburn and my bee sting!
Lincoln::: And now, to suit up and cool down.  Ouch! My sunburn and my bee sting and my twisted ankle!
Lincoln::: On a hot summer day, there's nothing like a refreshing dip in your own pool.  CANNONBALL!  Aah!  How the...when did...what are you guys doing here?
Lori::: Lincoln, this is literally genius. Who's gonna kick us out of our own pool? Right? 
Leni::: Are you getting in? There's totes room for one more.
Lincoln::: Um, actually...  ...there's only room for one. See? Says so on the box. Paradise for-
Lynn:::  CHICKEN FIGHT! I call Lincoln!
Lynn::: Come on, partner! You gotta plant those feet!
Lincoln::: Whoa!  Oof!
Lincoln:::  Lily! No skinny dipping!  Lisa! No! What do you think you're doing?
Lisa::: Testing sanitation levels. I've concocted a special serum that will detect and eliminate urine, AKA tinkle, in H2O.
Lincoln::: I'm sure no one here would...
Lisa::: Hmm... unprecedented levels.
Luan::: Marco!
Leni::: Marco!
Luan::: No, Leni. I'm Marco. You're Polo.
Leni::: Then who's Leni?
Lincoln::: Oh, no no no no no!  No fecal incidents in my pool! I'm watching you, Lily.  Lucy? I didn't know you liked to swim.
Lucy::: I'm not swimming. I'm trying to see if I'm a witch. Am I floating?
Lincoln::: Yes.
Lucy::: Wicked.
Lincoln:::  Get back here!
Lynn::: You know what your soup needs? Noodles! 
Lana:::  Bring it!
Lola::: STOP SPLASHING ME!
Lincoln::: Guys, no horseplay!
Luan::: What about elephant play? 
Lincoln:::  Huh? Bobby? What are you doing here?
Bobby::: Lori said there was an opening for a lifeguard at Casa Loud.  Everyone out! Senior swim!
Lincoln::: What? There aren't any old people here!
Lori::: Um, hello! High school senior?  Shoo shoo. Oh, this really is paradise for one.
Lincoln::: THAT...IS...IT!
Lincoln::: In case you guys haven't noticed, this is my pool! I bought it and spent all day setting it up, and I haven't even gotten in it yet! I'm too busy keeping all of you from ruining it!
Lynn::: But we were just having fun!
Lincoln::: Loud family, out!
Lincoln::: Finally. Time to...CANNONBALL!  What? Warning. No cannonballs. May cause tears. How did I not notice this before? Eh, I'll just rip this off.  No removing the warning label? Sheesh! What can I do?  That's all right. This is still gonna be paradise for one.  Marco! Marco!  Ugh!  What's going on? 
Lori::: Oh, that's fierce, babe.
Lynn:::  En garde!
Lana:::  Have at thee! Ha!
Lola:::  Just because I'm fabulous doesn't mean I can't have fun.  La-la-la, la-la-la
Luan::: Okay, this time, instead of Marco Polo, why don't we just use our real names?
Leni::: Okay. So, I'm...  Lincoln?
Luan::: Boy, you really don't get this game at all, do you?  Oh, hey, Linc!
Lincoln::: Hey, guys...what's all this?
Lori::: Well, little bro, you had such a good idea in buying your pool, we decided to-
Luan::: -pool our money to get this one!  That's using your noodle!  Ow.
Leni::: Aren't you gonna get in? There's totes room for one more.
Lincoln::: You're gonna let me use your pool, even though I kicked you out of mine?
Lola::: Well, he was kind of a meanie.
Lucy::: Not to mention selfish.
Lori::: And bossy.
Bobby::: And he stole my whistle!
Luan::: But that doesn't mean he can't use our pool.
Lincoln::: Really?
Lynn::: Well, duh. It's more fun with all of us.
Leni::: Yeah! All ten of us!
Lucy::: Leni, there are eleven of us.
Leni::: Oh, that's right. I forgot Marco.
Lincoln::: Well, in that case...CANNONBALL!!! 
Lincoln::: NOOOOOO!!
Luna::: Whoa, dude...looks like pool's out for summer.
Lori::: How we are gonna keep cool now?
Lisa::: I'll go get the frozen succotash.
Lincoln::: No worries, guys. I got just the thing.
Lincoln:::  So, it turns out that a pool, and basically everything that's awesome in life, is more fun when everyone gets to be a part of it.
Bobby::: Fecal incident!
Kids::: LOUD FAMILY, OUT!
Lily:::
