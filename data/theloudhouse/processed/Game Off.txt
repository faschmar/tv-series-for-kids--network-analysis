Lincoln::: Woohoo, yeah!  Yes, level seven!
Lana::: Aw, rats, I wanted to use the TV! Booger Battle is on.  Huh? Whoa, what's this game?
Lincoln::: It's called Total Trash Takedown. You get five lives to get to the Trash Castle, where you have to defeat the Trash King.
Lana::: Oh, that sounds awesome!
Lincoln::: I'm almost at the end. I've been trying to finish it for weeks.
Lana:::  Ah, look at all that trash.
Lana::: Ooh, what's that?
Lincoln::: Rotten apple. You have to collect three in each level before he can move on.
Lana::: That one has a worm in it, sweet!  Look out!  Yes!  My turn! My turn!
Lincoln::: Ooh, I'm sorry Lana.
Lana::: What? I don't have any boogers on my fingers!
Lincoln::: It's not that, I just got to the last level and I only have one life left. I can't risk losing it. As soon as I finish this level, you can play all you want.
Lana::: Aww, how long is that gonna take?
Lincoln::: I don't know, I've never gotten this far.
Lynn Sr.::: Chow time, kiddos. Cheese puff crusted tilapia on the table. 
Lincoln::: Five more minutes, Dad! I'm on a roll here!
Lynn Sr.::: Well, you'd better roll your butt to the table before dinner gets cold. Let's go kiddos, chop-chop. 
Lincoln::: 
Lana::: Wait, I didn't get to play!
Lincoln::: Sorry Lans, hopefully, I can finish tomorrow, then it'll be your turn. 
Lana::: Aww man. 
Lana::: Huh?
Worm::: Don't you wanna play?
Lana::: Yes! More than anything!
Imaginary Pixel Lincoln::: Sorry, Lana. You'll have to wait.
Lana::: I can't wait! I need to play that game right now!  I'll just play for a few minutes, then go back to exactly where Lincoln left off. He'll never even know I touched it.  Trash Hoard Below? Uh, yes please!  Game over?  Wait, what?! Oh, no no no no no no no no!  Back to the start? 
Lana::: And then I messed up and I lost all the progress on Lincoln's game!
Leni::: He's gonna be really upset.
Lynn::: He's gonna be furious. He'll never forgive you.
Lucy:::  You'll be dead to him.
Lily:::  Ye-yeah.
Lana::: That's why he can't find out! If I can just get him back to the Trash Castle, he'll never know I played his game. But I can't do it alone. Will you guys help me?
Lana:::  Come on, guys! I mean, who keeps the can unclogged? Who keeps Vanzilla running like a dream?
Lynn::: I guess she's right.
Luan::: Makes sense.
Leni::: Okay, we'll help!
Lana::: Thanks, guys! Lynn, Lisa, can you help me with the first seven levels?
Lisa::: Huh. I do not profess to know much about the world of virtual gaming.
Lana::: Yeah, but you're the fastest reader.  So I need you to go through this manual and tell me all the best tips and tricks for getting through the game fast. And Lynn, I'm gonna need you to keep me pumped up and in the zone! 
Lynn::: You got it, Lans!
Lana::: Okay, now for the rest of you, as soon as Lincoln wakes up, he's gonna wanna play that game. So we need an excuse to get him out of the house before he can. Something he can't resist.
Lola:::  Linky! So glad I ran into you! I just had the best idea! Let's go grab some Flippees!  My treat!
Lincoln::: Oh man! That's...  ...unusually nice of you, but I've got a date with a video game. Maybe another time?
Lola:::  It's only good today!  Right now!
Lincoln::: Sorry, I can't.
Leni:::  OMGosh! Lincoln, I just found a ton of quarters at the bottom of my purse! Wanna go to Gus' Games 'n' Grub? And play that dancing game?
Lincoln:::  Leni, we've talked about this. Are you sure they're quarters?
Leni:::  Yes.
Lincoln::: Well, I appreciate it, but I've got other plans.  Maybe another time.
Lucy::: Lincoln, bone-chilling news, they just opened a new zombie escape room downtown. 
Lincoln:::  That sounds awesome, we should go some time. 
Lucy::: The time is now, the first twenty people in line get in for free.
Lincoln::: For free? Well,  I wanted to play my game,  but how can I turn down a free zombie escape room? Let's go.
Lucy:::  And that's how it's done.
Lana::: Ha, thanks guys.  Okay, Lynn and Lisa, it's game time!  Okay, Lincoln should be out of the house for at least two hours,  that should be plenty of time to get him back to the Trash Castle!
Lisa::: Right, I've learned many tricks to aid in your quest. For example, in the first level, there's a recycling bin shortcut that allows you to jump ahead two levels.
Lana::: I knew I could count on you Lis. Okay, let's play.
Lynn::: Wait,  First you gotta get loose. Don't wanna cramp up during a crucial play.  Now let's do some jumping jacks to get the blood pumping, one, two,
Lisa:::  The clock's ticking here.
Lynn::: Oh, right, sorry.
Lisa::: Watch out for that compost beast.
Lynn:::  Nice hustle Lans.
Lisa:::  Gah! Don't go in that dumpster. Look for the recycling bin shortcut.  That's the ticket.
Lana::: Level four, here we come.
Lynn::: Whoo! Team Loud for the win.
Lynn::: Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!
Lisa:::  Jump there!
Lana::: Okay guys. Just one level left before we get to the Trash Castle.
Lisa::: According to my calculations, you should have at least a half an hour until Lincoln gets home.
Lynn::: Crud! They're on their way back.
Lana::: What? How?
Lynn::: Lincoln was really good at that escape room.  They finished with twenty minutes to spare.
Lana::: Ah! I need more time.
Lynn::: I got this.  Lori! You're up!
Lori:::  I'm literally on it. 
Lincoln:::  Hmm?
Lori:::  Whoa! Crazy running into you guys! Get in! I'll give you a ride home.
Lincoln::: That's okay. We're almost there.
Lori::: Oh! But you must be so tired from your escape room. Come on! 
Lincoln::: Yeah!
Lucy::: Yes. Very tired. Thanks, Lori. 
Lori::: Now, I just have to make a quick pitstop at the dry cleaners.
Lincoln::: Wait, just let us out then, I don't wanna go on errands.
Lori::: Oh, it'll just take a sec.
Lynn::: Okay, we bought ourselves more time. Keep it up, Lans.
Lana::: This level is so much harder than the other ones.  Agh! Only 4 lives left!
Lana::: Man, I only have one life left!
Dry Cleaning Employee::: Hm. The only Loud I'm seeing in our system is a Lola Loud.  But she picked up her sequined rainbow jumpsuit yesterday. 
Lincoln:::  Weren't you picking up dry cleaning?
Lori:::  No!  I...was getting us puffy mints!  Aren't I such a good sister? 
Lincoln::: Can we go home now? I wanna get back to my game.
Lori::: Uh...  No. Sorry, Lynn just texted that she needs, um... emergency lacrosse balls.
Lincoln:::  Fine, but, let me out. I'm not running another errand.
Lori::: Forget it, we'll go home.
Lynn:::  Lana, you gotta finish this level NOW! Lincoln is almost home.
Lana::: Ah, this game is impossible! Now I see why it took Lincoln so long to get to the trash castle.  The finish dumpster. That's the end of the level!
Lynn and Lisa::: Look out!
Lana::: No, no, no, no, no!  That was my last life! 
Lynn::: Run, Lana!
Lisa::: Save yourself!
Lincoln:::  Hey Lans.  What are you doing?
Lana:::  I messed up.
Lincoln:::  What happened?!
Lana::: I thought I could play your game for just a little bit, but, I lost your last life.
Lincoln:::  NO! Lana! It took me two weeks to get to the last level!  I can't believe you did this!
Lana:::  I'm so sorry. I spent all day trying to get you back to the Trash Castle. Lynn and Lisa even helped.  But I died right before I could make it. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Lincoln:::  No, just...  leave me alone. I have a lot of work to do.
Lana::: Hey, I don't wanna interrupt, but, I just wanted to tell you, I did all your chores.  And I made you this snack tray, I got your favorite kind of Flippee, cherry and blue bonanza, and those smelly crackers you like.
Lincoln:::  Oh, thanks.  Man this part is so tough.
Lana::: Yeah, though if you time your jumps to the music, you'll avoid all the potholes.
Lincoln::: Wait, really?  Woah, it worked. Hey, do you know any more tricks?
Lana::: Yeah, I actually learned a ton of them before, you know, ruining your game.
Lincoln::: Wanna help me play?
Lana::: Are you sure? Even after everything I did?
Lincoln::: Yeah, I can tell you're really sorry.  Hey, after I finish my game, maybe we can start a new one, for you.
Lana:::  You are the best.
Lynn::: Whoo! Team Loud for the win!
