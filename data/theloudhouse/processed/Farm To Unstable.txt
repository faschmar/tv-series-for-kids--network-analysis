Rusty::: Anyone want to trade me for these delicious sardines?  My dad says they're the ocean's candy.
Rusty's friends::: Eww!
Zach::: Your dad also says anchovy's the only good pizza topping so, no.
Rusty:::  Hey! Don't yuck at my Dad's yum, bro!
Liam:::  Hey, I'll get in on that, Rustman. 
Rusty:::  Whoa! This has three kinds of pork in it.  Pleasure doing biz with you, farm boy.
Liam::: Oh, I didn't do it for me.  I did it for Carol Anne. She loves her sardines. 
Zach:::  Uh, Liam, why'd you bring Carol Anne to school?
Liam:::  Oh, this ain't a social visit. Tomorrow's the biggest Hunnicutt farm stand of the season. My family depends on it to keep the business running.  I still got a million things to do.
Rusty::: I don't wanna tell your family how to run the farm, but they sure are dumping a lot of work on you.
Liam::: Actually, I'm flying solo. Mee-Maw sprained her ankle, mud-wrestling Virginia, and my dad and my brother, they're at an egg convention.
Rusty::: Sorry, Liam. Wish there was something we could do.
Lincoln:::  Hmm...wait a second. There is something we can do.  We can all go to Liam's farm early tomorrow and help.
Liam:::  Oh, I couldn't ask y'all to do that.
Lincoln::: No problem.
Stella::: We're happy to help.
Zach::: That's what friends are for.
Liam:::  Aww, shucks. Y'all are the best.
Liam:::  Y'all have your assignments. I'll be setting up the stand while you do the farm work.
Rusty::: Meanwhile, I'll be chilling inside on Mee-Maw duty. Should be a piece of cake. Grandmas love me. 
Liam::: Uh...  Oh! After you guys package the products, you'll need to put one of these labels on each item. 
Stella:::  'Hunnicutt Farms, fresher than a loofah'ed pig!'
Liam:::  Oh, it's true. Everyone can tell the Hunnicutt difference. I got to say, y'all are really saving my hindquarters.  Why do we all stand around like a herd of hopeless heifers?! Let's farm it up!
Everyone::: SOOEY! 
Lincoln:::  Okay, Liam said Daisy will only let me milk her if we're friends. So...  Hi, Daisy. My name is Lincoln, and I'll be your milker.  Uh-oh.
Rusty::: Let's grab a snack, and then we can settle in for an infomercial marathon. 
Mee-Maw:::  No TV. I need you to cook me some grits.  Look alive, Red. 
Rusty::: We'll need a ham-fist of butter, a hoop-de-hoop of cream cheese--
Mee-Maw:::  --And a lickety-split of lard!  Does that look like a ham-fist to you? That's barely a piggly-wiggly.
Rusty::: I'm sorry, Mee-Maw. I don't speak farm.
Mee-Maw::: I'm saying it needs more butter.  Now stir it. Faster.  Come on, Red! Let's get these done. I gotta check on your pals and make sure they're not messing up my farm.
Rusty:::  Grandmas usually love me.
Clyde::: Huh?  Wonder where all the chickens went. Well, this should be easy-breezy.  Farmer Clyde had a farm, E-I-E-I--  Oh no. 
Mee-Maw::: What the heck was that? I haven't heard a noise like that since Virginia's night terrors.
Rusty::: Uh, that's just Clyde. Singing. He's in Glee Club, you know.  Sounds great, bud!  Uh, let's go check on Stella and her sheep.
Mee-Maw::: Red, are you sure that was singing back there?
Rusty::: You know what? Sheep are easy. I'm sure Stella's got that covered.  Let's uh... go check on the rutabagas. 
Zach::: Huh?
Rusty::: I'm sure Zach's got everything under--  Nope! There's something important that we forgot to do, inside.
Lincoln::: Man, this farm work is way harder than I thought it would be.
Stella::: Yeah, it's exhausting. And we have nothing to show for it.
Zach:::  Aw, that's not true. I did get this sweet gopher bite. 
Clyde:::  We'll never finish in time for the farm stand. What are we gonna do? We can't let Liam down.
Lincoln:::  Hmm... what if we took a little shortcut? We could combine our money and go buy the farm goods in town. No one will ever know the difference. Eggs are eggs, right?
Zach:::  I'm in.
Stella::: Me too.
Clyde::: Well, normally scheming gives me a stomach ache, but you should have seen the size of that mama chicken. She almost had me for dinner! So yeah, I'm in. 
Mee-Maw::: This is what you rushed me back inside for? A manicure?
Rusty:::  Uh, yeah. I want you looking your best. Can't have janky cuticles for the farm stands.
Stella::: Psst. Rusty.
Rusty::: Okay. You let these bad boys dry, and I'll be right back.  What is it?
Lincoln::: We need to run into town. Can you cover for us if Liam or Mee-Maw wants to check on us?
Rusty::: Make it quick. I've been covering for you guys all morning, and I'm running out of excuse.  Time for your pedicure.  Big Red's coming for those little piggies.
Lincoln::: Let's go!
Lincoln::: I'm feeling really good about this plan.
Zach::: Hmm... 'Closed for floor buffing'? Where are we gonna go now?
Lincoln::: Well, there's only one place to go when you're desperate. 
Flip::: Ooh, I know that smell. Sweet, sweet desperation.
Lincoln::: Okay, gang, we've got to be quick. First, we need eggs and milk. 
Zach::: These packages are pretty dusty.
Clyde:::  Nothing a little antibacterial wipe can't fix.  I'm not going back in that chicken coop.
Lincoln::: Next, we need--
Stella:::  Look. Flip's got rutabagas.
Flip::: Oh... so that's what those are. Eh, they sound fancy.  Add five buckaroos to the price. 
Stella::: They're pretty limp. We'll have to plump them up for the farm stand.
Lincoln::: Now all we need is wool.
Flip:::  Uh, for ten bucks, I'll shave my back for you. 
Zach::: Hey, Flip, I'll trade you a gopher tooth for that chair. 
Flip::: Ooh, deal.
Rusty::: And voila.
Mee-Maw::: Oh, great job, Red!  Oh, look, you painted Virginia.  I got a piggy on my little piggy. Okay, I think they're dry. Now, take me out to the farm so I can check in on the kids.
Rusty:::  No! Because...  ...it's time for Virginia's pedicure. I'm gonna paint little pictures of you on her hooves.  Ah, mudhole brown. Excellent choice, Madam.
Lincoln::: Now we just need to take Flip's price tags off of everything.  And replace them with these Hunnicutt Farm stickers.
Liam::: Wow.  Great job. Y'all really came through in the clutch.
Lincoln::: Wait! Uh, there was a horsefly. 
Mee-Maw::: Alrighty, what can I get you, Mr. Grouse?
Mr. Grouse:::  I'll take a bag of rutabagas.
Mee-Maw:::  Next.
Cheryl::: We'll take two bundles of your fresh sheep's wool. We're making dresses for our double date later.
Meryl:::  Errol and Daryl are taking us to that new kitten cafe.  Now that's two cups of sugar.
Mee-Maw::: I hope y'all have fun.
Meryl:::  Thanks.
Scoots::: Give a dozen eggs and some milk.  Tyler's gonna make pies for my motorcycle club's rager tonight.
Tyler::: And I'm also Deejaying the party.
Scoots and Tyler:::  Scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot.
Mee-Maw::: Hoo-wee, this was our best farm stand ever!
Liam::: Yes, sirree! Whoo-hoo!
Scoots::: What are you punks trying to pull?
Mee-Maw::: Mr. Grouse, what happened to you?
Mr. Grouse::: What happened is,  I ate your rutabagas. 
Scoots::: You call this milk? I call it sludge!
Meryl::: You're telling us! We tried on our new dresses made from your wool and got the itchies.
Cheryl:::  We had to cancel our double date with Errol and Daryl!
Liam::: But our products can't be the cause of y'all's misery. Everything we sell is fresh.
Mr. Grouse:::  Eh, could've fooled me! I'm never coming back to this farm stand-- again. 
Customers::: We want our money back! I demand a refund! Give me my money back!
Customer::: We showed them! Get me out of here.
Mee-Maw::: Oh, Liam, this is a crying shame.  We need that money to keep the farm going.
Liam::: Huh. Something's weird here.
Mee-Maw::: What's a Flip's sticker doing on our 'bagas?
Lincoln::: Um, this is our fault. We couldn't handle the hard work so we took a shortcut.
Zach::: We bought everything at Flip's.
Mee-Maw:::  Red, take me inside!
Liam::: Oh, man. I can't believe y'all did this. 
Stella::: Man, we messed up. If we'd just done the work in the first place, this wouldn't have happened.
Clyde:::  I think we all need an emergency session with Dr. Lopez. She offers a great group rate.
Lincoln::: I don't think that's necessary, Clyde. I've got an idea.
Clyde::: Thanks. Enjoy the pie.
Clyde::: Get your farm fresh eggs!
Lincoln::: Step right up. --Here you go. 
Liam::: What y'all doing here? We don't have a farm stand on Sundays.
Lincoln::: You do today. We worked all night and did it the right way this time.
Zach::: And we tracked down your customers and told them that the rotten items they bought weren't from your farm.
Stella::: They weren't thrilled to see us at five in the morning, but we had to get your good name back.
Liam:::  Well, gosh. Y'all are the best friends a feller could ever ask for.  Bring it in.
Mee-Maw::: D'oh, this calls for a celebratory dance.  Spin me, Red!  RED! 
Rusty:::  I'm gonna have to redo her mani-pedi.
