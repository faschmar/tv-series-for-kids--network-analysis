Adelaide::: Leo, Roary, how are your sore throats?  Sounding better.  How's the water temperature, guys?  Bravo!  Lunch time!  Banana for you, banana for you, banana for you.
Nico?::: Adelaide. Adelaide...
Sid::: Adelaide, you're getting bananas on my junior zookeeper vest. 
Adelaide::: Sorry, Sid.  I'm just so pumped about earning my own junior zookeeper title today!
Sid::: I get it. It's pretty awesome. Mom tell you all about the sweet perks?
Adelaide::: Oh, you mean the free zoo snacks, unlimited tram tickets, and getting to name a baby animal? She may have mentioned it.
Sid::: I hear Penny the panda is expecting.
Adelaide::: Ooooh! I'm gonna name it Pandalaide! Eeeeee!
Becca:::  Remember, Adelaide. It's not just about the perks. It's about taking care of the animals' needs.
Adelaide::: Mother, what they need is cuddles.
Carl::: Ahhh-ah-ah-ah-ahhh! I'm a monkey!
CJ::: Monkeys don't swing on vines because...
Carl::: Wah-oof!
CJ::: ...vines break.
Adelaide::: Carl? CJ? What are you guys doing here? Did you come to watch me become a junior zookeeper?
CJ::: I came to be one!
Carl::: Oh yeah. I can't wait for those sweet perks! I'm gonna be zoo king! 
CJ::: I just want to learn more about the animals.
Zebra::: Hey, you know, CJ, a group of zebras is called a dazzle.
CJ::: Thank you, Mr. Zebra!  So interesting!
Adelaide::: Mom, you'd better break the news that I'm gonna be junior zookeeper.
Becca::: Actually, sweetie, anyone can become a junior zookeeper. So you guys will be working as a team today, and hopefully you'll all earn the title. Now let's go, team!
Adelaide::: Okay, I can do a team. And every team needs a leader. Three votes for me? Great!
CJ::: Hey, I didn't even vote!
Carl:::  Yeah, you're not the boss of me!  Wahhhhhhhhhh!  Ow.
Becca::: To become junior zookeepers, you kiddos will need to earn four badges. First up, grooming.
Adelaide::: Ooh, are we gonna bathe Bitsy?
Becca::: Bitsy's has got that covered.
Becca::: Let's go see who you'll really be helping today.  Glen the Gator isn't quite as self-sufficient as our old pal Bitsy.
Carl::: What do you mean? He looks clean.
Becca::: Oh, Glen doesn't need a bath. He needs a good toothbrushing.  Sounds like Bitsy needs her twenty-five towels. Be back in five.
Carl:::  How do you open this thing?
Adelaide::: Okay team, I got this.
Carl:::  Hey! I wanna hold it!
CJ::: Guys, work together.
Adelaide::: You're supposed to brush up and down!
Carl::: No, tiny circles!
Becca:::  Great job, everyone.
Becca::: You'll earn your feeding badge by whipping up a healthy, delicious meal for Spike and Prickly Pete.  They're total foodies, so choose wisely.
Adelaide:::  Let's make them a salad.
Carl::: No.  Everyone knows porcupines are suckers for smoothies.
CJ::: Guys, cut it out.
Adelaide::: Salad!
Carl::: Smoothies!
Adelaide::: Salad!
Carl::: Smoothies!
Adelaide::: Salad!
Carl::: Smoothies!
CJ::: I got this. En garde!  Lunch is served.
Becca::: Ooh, kabobs. Good thinking, team.
Carl & Adelaide::: Huh?
Becca::: You're halfway through to becoming junior zookeepers.
Adelaide::: Pandalaide, I'll be seeing you soon.
Carl::: Pandalaide? I'm naming the baby panda, and his name is El Falcón Jr.
Becca::: The third badge is first aid. And I just noticed that poor Gregor has a quill stuck in his neck.  No idea how that happened.  Here's a bandage.
Adelaide::: Nice going, Carl! It's your fault the quill got stuck.
Carl:::  You started it!
CJ:::  Come on guys, let's work together.
Carl::: Hey! Give it back!
CJ::: I got this. Hold the ladder.
Adelaide::: You're not holding it right.
Carl::: Oh, come on.
Adelaide::: Carl!
CJ::: Woah. Aah!
Carl & Adelaide::: Oh, no, CJ!
CJ::: Thanks, Connie! Can I get a boost?
Becca:::  Good job, kids.
Becca::: Last badge, habitat maintenance.
Carl::: Awesome! I'm great at that. Uh, what is that?
Becca::: It means you'll be building a home for one of our new and endangered animals Lois the Galapagos Tortoise.
CJ::: She's beautiful.
Becca::: Yes she is, CJ. And she needs a special habitat to thrive.  Here are some building materials.  Okay, good luck. Be back in a sec. Oh and keep this gate closed. Lois likes to run out.
Adelaide::: As group leader, I say we use bamboo for the base of the shelter.
Carl::: No way, we should use rocks.
Adelaide:::  Fine, then I'm doing my own habitat.
Carl::: Hey! Watch it!  Let's see which one Lois likes better.
CJ:::  Either way, she'll need shade. I'll get some leaves. Keep an eye on Lois.
Adelaide:::  Mine's gonna be a castle with a moat so you can't come in!
Carl:::  Oh, yeah? Mine's gonna be a fortress! With a 'No Adelaides Allowed' sign!
Adelaide::: Mine has three bedrooms and a walk-in closet. Bam-boom!
Carl::: Yeah? Well, mine has four pools, a hot tub and a wave pool! Which is so much cooler, right, Lois?
Adelaide:::  Lois? You scared her off with all your pools.
Carl::: Hello, she's right there.
Adelaide:::  That's not Los, that's a rock!
Carl & Adelaide:::  Lois? Lois?
CJ:::  Let me guess. You were so busy fighting you forgot to watch Lois.
Adelaide:::  It's his fault!
Carl:::  It's her fault!
Adelaide::: Oh, who are we kidding!? It's both our faults. We'll never be junior zookeepers now.
CJ::: Guys, we have to find Lois.
Adelaide::: You're right. What's the plan, CJ?
CJ::: We have to work together. Can you do that? For Lois?
Carl & Adelaide::: Let's do it!
CJ::: Hmm… If only I could get a little higher.  Thanks, Gregor!
Adelaide:::  You're actually doing a pretty good job of holding that side, Carl.
Carl::: Thanks, you're not doing too bad yourself, Adelaide.
CJ::: I see her! Oh, no, she's on the tram!  Ah! Runaway tram!
Adelaide::: It's going too fast. We need to stop it!
Carl::: I know what to do.
Carl:::  Ready…
Adelaide:::  Aim…
CJ::: Fire.
Adelaide::: Glen's going to eat Lois!  Lois! We got you!
CJ::: Lois weighs two-hundred pounds.
Carl::: Come on, Lois! You gotta run! Go, Lois, go!  You have to go faster than that!
CJ::: I know, come on!  Guys, jump on the brush.  On three. One, two, three!
Kids::: We did it! Yay!
Adelaide::: That roof looks awesome, CJ.
CJ:::  Thanks. Nice deck, Carl.
Car:::  Thanks, hermano! That walk-in closet really sells it, Adelaide!
Adelaide:::  Couldn't have done it without my team!
Becca::: Love your new place, Lois. You guys did a great job.
Carl::: It was a group effort!
Becca::: You're all officially junior zookeepers. And now for your first task, naming the baby panda.
Adelaide::: Pandalaide!
Carl::: El Falcón Jr!
Adelaide::: Actually, why don't we let CJ decide?
CJ::: Ooh. I think I'll call him Señor Stinky!
Becca::: Your next task is changing him.
Carl:::  Ugh, I'm outta here.  I meant to do that.
