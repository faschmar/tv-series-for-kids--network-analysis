Mrs. Kernicky::: Ah! Can't wait for dance class tonight! I'm gonna get my groove on.
Mrs. Flores::: Right? And dancing is just so romantic.
Rosa::: Did you say dancing? I love dancing.
Mrs. Kernicky::: Well, you're in luck! There's a new ballroom dance studio that opened up nearby.
Mrs. Flores::: Yes, come! The teacher is amazing. And the first class is free. Hope to see you there.
Hector::: Futból and nachos, my two favourite things!
Vito::: Oh, I love stuffing my face while other people exercise.
Bruno::: Yuck.
Rosa::: Hector, there's a new ballroom dance class happening tonight.
Hector::: I got a bad nacho.
Rosa:::  That's the flyer for the class. Let's try it. It would mean so much to me.
Hector::: But the Gatos are playing, I can't leave the boys in the middle of the game.  Besides my old school moves are just fine. Look, I can do the merengue,  salsa, oldies. I'm a dancing machine.
Rosa:::  Fine, if your game is so important, I'll go take the class alone.
Hector:::  Knew you'd understand. Love you!
Bruno::: I feel like that's gonna come back to bite you later.
Rosa::: What am I doing? I can't dance alone maybe I should just go home.
Ivan::: Hello, beautiful. may I have this dance?
Announcer::: Goal! Gatos win!
Hector, Bruno, Vito & Sergio:::  Meow! Meow! Meow! Gatos win now, now, now!
Hector::: Oh, how was class, Rosa?
Rosa::: The best! My new partner really knows how to move.
Vito:::  Ha, you hear that? She's got a new partner.
Bruno::: Who can really move.
Sergio:::  Unlike you.
Hector::: Are you saying I should be jealous?  Ah. Well, too bad. I'm not
Rosa:::  Bueno? Ivan! I was thinking about you too!  Oh, stop.
Hector:::  Oye nada. Whoa!  What? I'm not jealous.
Mrs. Kernicky::: Have you noticed how much chemistry Rosa and Ivan have in dane class? 
Mrs. Flores::: Who wouldn't have chemistry with him? He's so handsome. And his moves.
Hector::: I'm not jealous.
Vito::: Heh, right. your eye always twitches like that.
Hector::: Ooh, tamales for us? Thank you!
Rosa::: No, no, no this is from my dance class. I promised Ivan a home-cooked meal.
Hector:::  Now I'm jealous! You don't steal a man's tamales! This dancing bobo has got to go!
Vito & Sergio::: Yeah! Let's get him!
Bruno::: Hey, what about the game?
Vito::: Woah. That's her partner?  Looks like he's also the teacher.  So what's the plan? How do we stop this gorgeous hunk?
Hector:::  Well, they have class without electricity.
Rosa:::  The power went out!
Mrs. Flores::: How will we have class now?
Ivan::: In romantic candlelight, my twinkle toes.
Mrs. Flores::: Ay, fantastico.
Sergio:::  Amateurs. Leave the sabotage to me.  Come and get it, actual gatos!
Ivan::: Animals love me.
Hector::: You win this time, Ivan. But this isn't over!
Hector::: We gotta figure out a way to stop this dance class. All Rosa talks about is Ivan this, dancing that, and now she's going every night. I want my wife back.
Bruno:::  Here's a wild idea just go and dance with her.
Hector::: Nah. What kind of bobo idea is that? We need a real plan. One that gets Ivan and his moves out of our lives forever.
Henry::: Howdy, boys. Your turn for a surprise inspection, Hector.
Hector::: Oh. Hey, Henry.
Henry:::  That bird yours? Wild animals are a health code violation, you know. They're filthy!
Sergio::: Hey! I bathe…  Sometimes.
Hector::: Sergio's okay. He's our pet.
Henry::: Okay, Bird seems clean enough. All good
Hector::: That's it! I know exactly how to get rid of that bobo, Ivan, and his bobo dance class.
Bruno::: Oh boy, here we go again.
Hector:::  Come on, Vito. I'm gonna need your help.
Sergio::: See? I bathe. Refill?
Bruno::: I'm good.
Hector::: Sancho, you guys, quit squirming.  Wait until I give the signal.  Health inspector.
Ivan::: Oh. I didn't know we were due for an inspection. Be right with you.  Sorry, I get caught up in my art.
Hector::: Well, you're so caught up, you didn't notice you have an infestation.  Wild animals are a health code violation, you know.  I'm shutting you down.
Ivan::: Wait. Please give me a chance to get rid of the birds. My class has a recital next week and we still need to reverse.
Hector::: Not my problem. It's for public health.
Ivan:::  I understand.
Hector::: Score one for Team Hector.:
Bruno::: I feel like a world-class wiener.
Hector::: Yeah, but a wiener that wins.
Rosa::: Of course it's fine. Come right over. See you soon, Ivan.
Hector::: Ivan? He's still hanging arou… I mean… what's up, Rosa?
Rosa::: Oh, the health department closed down Ivan's dance studio so we're having class here tonight. They'll be here any minutes now.
Hector::: What? Here? But it's game night.  Which we can do at Vito's.
Rosa::: Ah. that must be that now.
Sergio:::  He'll recognize you. Quick, hide.
Ivan::: And now, a warm-up conga line! Loosen up those hips and shake 'em. Loosen up those hips and shake 'em.   Loosen up those hips and shake 'em. Loosen up those hips and shake 'em.  Loosen up those hips and shake 'em.
Rosa::: Hector, what are you doing under the table?
Ivan::: Huh? You're the health inspector who shut down my studio.
Sergio::: Ooh, this is gonna be good.
Rosa::: Him? He's not a health inspector. He's my husband.
Mrs. Kernicky::: Awkward.
Ivan::: It seems you two have a lot to talk about. I'm going to reopen my studio.
Mrs. Kernicky::: Time to bounce, everyone.
Rosa::: Hector Casagrande, explain.
Hector::: Well, I was tired of hearing you talk about Ivan and this dance class, okay? So I thought if I shut it down that would be the end of it.
Rosa::: Hector! How could you be so selfish? I don't want to talk to you right now.
Bruno:::  Gee, who could have seen this coming?
Hector:::  I need to fix this.
Sergio:::  And I need more popcorn.
Hector::: Wow, animals really do love you.
Ivan::: Now what do you want?
Hector::: I'm here to apologize. And to help clean up so Rosa and her class can dance here again. I'm sorry, Ivan, I was jealous of how much fun Rosa was having in your class. But if dancing with you makes her happy that's all that matters.
Ivan::: I see. Honestly, this happens to me a lot. I face many jealous beaus. My husband says it's the curse of being this handsome. But it's also taught me how to read people, and I think what would make Rosa truly happy is to dance with you, not with me.
Hector::: I don't know if can handle all those fancy moves you guys do.  What are you doing?
Ivan::: Teaching you, soon my fancy moves will be your fancy moves. Now come, we have a recital to prepare for.
Hector::: Okay you handsome bobo show me what you got.
Rosa::: Thank you for doing this with me.
Hector::: It's what I should have done in the first place. And it is kind of fun.
Rosa::: I'm glad you feel that way because I signed us up for the advanced class, and it starts tomorrow.
Hector::: What? I mean, I'd love to.
Ivan:::  Beautiful! My best students! Now, everybody, finale conga! Let's go!  Move those hips!
