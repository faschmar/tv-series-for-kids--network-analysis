Lynn Sr.::: Hey, guys! Papa Loud in the house!
Lynn Sr.::: So, how was everyone's day? Lori, did you ace that Latin exam?  Hey, Lunes, wanna jam later? Just got the old cowbell tuned.
Rita:::  This is unbelievable!
Lynn Sr.:::  Thank you, honey. I couldn't agree-
Rita::: 10 Unexpected Ways to Re-tile a Backsplash? Cuh-lick! 
Leni::: Oh. Hi, Dad. Welcome home. Why the grumpy face?
Lori::: But, Dad, we need them. Our lives literally depend on them.
Lynn Sr.:::  Baloney sandwich! They're just little hunks of plastic!  And if you don't start spending less time on them, I'm gonna have to cut the internet.
Luna::: Whoa! Pops is talking crazy! Doesn't he get how croosh these babies are to our lives? He might as well cut off our oxygen supply!
Lori::: Maybe that's the answer!
Lucy::: Whoa. That's grim, even for me.
Lori::: No, I mean the only reason Dad is against our devices is because he doesn't get them. But what if we could show Dad how much better it could make his life? Then he'd never do something as ridiculous as...  ...taking away our internet.
Rita:::  I love it!
Lori::: Thank you. I appreciate your support.
Rita:::  A new super bright flashlight app? #Download!  Oh, hey, kids. When did you get home?
Lynn Sr.::: Okay.  Gotta tell Lucy her funeral dress is back from the cleaners, gotta let Luna know I can drive her to rehearsal tonight, I need to remind Lola that she can't watch TV till she's finished her homework. All of it.  Oh. Hi, Lori.
Lori:::  One sec, Dad.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, sweetie, we just talked about this. Can you please put that thing away?
Lori:::  Okay, Lucy says Thanks, just in time for the service, Luna says Rockin', and Lola sent this. 
Lynn Sr.:::  You just took care of my whole to-do list? How did you manage that?
Lori:::  It's called texting. You can literally have a million conversations at once. Could be pretty handy for a guy with 11 kids.
Lynn Sr.::: Uh, hold on. If I were going to do a text, how-how would I go about that?
Lori::: It's so easy. All you do is type. Where's your phone?
Lori::: Try texting me.
Lynn Sr.:::  Uh...where?
Lori::: Here.  Just say hi.
Lynn Sr.::: Ooh! Delete!
Lori:::  Dear Lori, I hope this 'text message' finds you well.  Sorry, Dad, but TL;DR. That means too long; didn't read. And it's the kind of abbrev that makes texting so much fun.
Lynn Sr.::: Ooh, let me try.  SGHICWTLM. That stands for Sounds good, honey. I can't wait to learn more.
Lori::: Uh...we'll work on it.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, why couldn't I resist all those Flippee samples? 
Luna::: Back of the line, bro.
Lynn Sr.::: Dah! 
Lincoln:::  Hey, Dad, want something to keep your mind off the wait?
Lynn Sr.::: Aw, no thanks. This is what I've been trying to tell you kids. I can just keep myself distracted with the old bean.
Lincoln::: Okay, but Leni's in there trying a new hair color. Could be a while.
Leni:::  Totes not a redhead! Starting over.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, fine. Whaddya got?
Lincoln:::  Raging River Racers. You have to paddle down a rushing river trying to escape a giant gushing wave.
Lynn Sr.:::  Gah, not helping.
Lola:::  Step aside, Lincoln. We have a game Daddy will actually like.
Lana:::  Presenting Jolly Hollow.
Lola::: You build a pretty brick house and show it off to your friends.
Lynn Sr.:::  Ooh, I think I'll build one that has more than one bathroom.
Lincoln:::  Your turn, Dad.
Lynn Sr.:::  Lisa can go. I'm busy upgrading my wallpaper.
Lynn Sr.::: Hey, kiddo. I need your opinion on something.  Which of these pictures should I submit for my high school reunion?
Leni::: Uh...what's Plan B?
Lynn Sr.::: These are the best I could find.
Leni::: Don't worry. I totes got this.  Perf!
Lynn Sr.::: Whoa! What magic is that?
Leni::: The magic of filters. This one's called Glory Days. 
Lynn Sr.:::  I look good! Can I borrow your phone so I can show this to Kotaro?
Leni::: Or, you can post it on 'SwitfyPic'. It's an app that lets you share pictures with your friends and family.
Lynn Sr.:::  Shut up!
Leni:::  I know, right?
Kotaro:::  We are gonna rock our first show, Lynn! Now we just need to get the word out. Remember, my cousin said we gotta have 100 people or we can't book his basement.
Lynn Sr.::: Way ahead of you, Kotaro.  I posted 500 of these babies to post around town. Hope your afternoon's free.
Luna::: Hey, Pops, I know you got a big gig coming up, so I thought I'd help you get the word out.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, great. You can start putting these up on Oak Street.
Luna::: Uh, no, dude.-- I made you a band page!  It's like putting up a flyer that everyone with a computer can see!
Lynn Sr.:::  Shut up!
Luna::: Right?
Lynn Sr.:::  We're gonna get hundreds of people to see our show.
Luan::: How about thousands?
Kotaro::: Well, parking's kinda limited at my cousin's.
Luan::: No. I mean, you can stream the show live for fans around the world.
Lynn Sr.::: Whoa. You think you could show us how to stream our concert like that?
Lynn Sr.::: Watching videos, texting emojis, selfie...  ...and post.  Nice.
Lori:::  I am literally so proud right now.
Lincoln::: It's a text from Dad. THX 4 showing me the light. Wut U kiddos think about getting FASTER internet? Racecar emoji, celebrate emoji, happy cat emoji.
Lincoln::: Hey, Dad, could you help me with my social studies homework?
Lynn Sr.::: Eh, sorry, son. It'll have to wait. It's Throwback Thursday, and I have to post some pics. And...post! 
Lori:::  WHAT DID YOU DO?! How could you post a picture from my...  ...awkward stage? 
Lynn Sr.::: Ooh! Five likes already!  Maybe it'll start trending.
Lincoln::: Don't be embarrassed, Lori. Everyone posts old photos like that. They're harmless. 
Lynn Sr.::: And...post. 
Lori:::  Oh, yeah? Then maybe you'd like to see Dad's latest post. 
Lincoln:::  #PottyChamp? #LinkyMadeAStinky? Oh... 
Lynn Sr.:::  So cute! I'll post this next TBT!
Luna::: Dudes, I'm hungry like the wolf. What's taking Dad so long?
Lynn Sr.::: And hello to my new viewer from Sweden, or should I say, Valkommen, to the Lynn-ternational Cuisine Livestream with Chef Loud. Today, we're making pizza.  Oh, wait. They can't see that.  Today, we're making pizza. 
Lynn Sr.:::  Alright, get ready to feast, fam.
Lynn Sr.::: Not so fast. I meant feast your eyes. We'll eat after I take photos for SwiftyPic.  Better take a few, JIC.  Ugh! I can't post these! They're totes ug. I'm starting over. 
Lincoln::: Hey, Dad.
Leni::: So, how was work today?
Luna::: Hey, Pop Star. Wanna jam later?
Lynn Sr.::: I'd love to...  ...send you an autographed CD, CowBellFan85!
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, hey, fam. When did you get home?
Lori::: Dad, how about we just put these away for one second?
Lisa::: Father is out of control, or, to use his inane vernacular, OOC.
Lynn::: He's got his face in those ding-dang devices all day long.
Lana::: Can't he put them down once in a while?
Lucy::: He doesn't even look up when we come in the door.
Lori:::  Uh, guys, is this all reminding you of anyone?
Lincoln:::  Holy moly! We literally turned Dad into us!
Lana::: You're right! So that's why he was upset with us. It's no fun being ignored by your own family.
Lola:::  How do we get the old Daddy back?
Leni::: Ask him politely?
Lori:::  I think it's gonna take more drastic measures than that.
Lori::: It's not out. We had it turned off. 
Lori:::  We had to do it! You're obsessed with your devices.
Lana::: Which, to be fair, is all our fault.
Leni::: But we totes miss spending time with you.
Lynn Sr.:::  Kids? I-I had no idea. ISS!  That means I'm So Sorry.
Lincoln::: It's okay, Dad.
Lori::: So, can we put these away for a while?
Lynn Sr.:::  Sure. No problem.  Ah, I can't! I'm so hooked on these babies I can't live without 'em.
Lori::: Don't worry, Dad. We'll all work on this together. 
Lynn Sr.:::  Oops! I'll get it. 
Lincoln:::  Dad! No phones! Besides, we don't even have the internet.
Lynn Sr.::: Sorry. I just wanted to hold it. 
Luna:::  Oops, you did it again. No looking at devices, Dad. Not even Mr. Grouse's.
Lynn Sr.::: But he just got a really good deal on socks.
Lynn Sr.::: Ha ha, nice one!
Lynn::: Whoo! Yeah!
Lola::: Duck...duck...duck...  GOOSE!
Lynn Sr.::: Huh? Huh?
Lincoln::: Good job, Dad. We're proud of you.
Lynn Sr.:::  Thanks, kids. It's good to be back. Now, who's hungry?  Dinner in five! 
Lisa::: So, now that we cured Father, shall I send word to our internet provider to get the rest of us back online?
Lori::: Eh, what's the rush? We can wait another day.
Lynn Sr.::: Let's dig in!
Lynn::: Hey, Dad, how about a hockey rematch after dinner?
Lola:::  Hey, I get Daddy first! I wanna show him my ribbon dance.
Lana::: No, I get him. We got some gutters to clean.
