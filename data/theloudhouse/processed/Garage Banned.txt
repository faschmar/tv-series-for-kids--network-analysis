Lori::: What? Who is that?  Oh, Lana.  Let me guess, Another bad dream?
Lola::: Lori, can you get my tangles out?
Lola::: Ow! Not like a gorilla!  She'll call you back, Boo-Boo Bear. 
Lori:::  Lola!
Lori::: Hi, Boo-Boo Bear. Sorry about that.
Leni::: Lori, does this outfit clash with my toenail color?
Lori::: It's fine.  So, Bobby, how was your night?
Lynn::: Let go of me!
Lucy::: Oh, my beloved!
Lynn::: Let go of me!
Lori::: Guys, what are you doing?
Lucy::: Lynn broke Edwin's fang.  Tell her she has to pay for his dental work.
Lynn::: He's a statue! The only thing I'm paying for is you getting your brain checked!
Lisa::: If you give me ten minutes, I can warm up my MRI machine.
Luan::: Or, we could just give her a CAT scan!  Get it?
Lori::: EVERYBODY, OUT! I'm trying to talk to Bobby!  Finally.
Leni::: Real quick. Is this outfit cuter?
Lori:::  Leni, it's literally the same outfit.
Lori::: Ah. Where were we, Boo-Boo Bear? Did you dream about me last night?
Mr. Coconuts::: Sure did, toots! We were smooching, and you were loving it. 
Lori::: AH! Luan! Get out of here!
Bobby::: Babe, what was that growl? Is there a gorilla in there?
Lori::: Guys, we have to talk. I am literally almost an adult. I can't live like this anymore.
Lynn::: So, you're finally gonna see a doctor about your flatulence problem?
Lori:::  What? I don't have a flatulence problem! I'm talking about living in this house. I can't even have an uninterrupted conversation with Bobby or sleep through the night without getting kicked in the face.
Lana::: Aren't you kind of exaggerating?  Oh.
Lori::: So, I talked to Mom and Dad and they said it was okay for me to move into the garage.
Lola::: You can't leave! We need you!
Lori::: You'll be fine. Besides, I'll be right by the house if you need anything.
Leni::: Oh, Lori, you're so lucky you get your own room.
Lana::: Bathroom's all set. Go easy on her at first. No heavy meals.
Rita::: Oh, I can't believe it. Our first little bird is leaving the nest.
Lynn Sr.::: I said I wouldn't cry... 
Lori::: You guys, I'm only 20 feet from the house, and you can visit anytime you want. But call first. 
Lincoln::: Parents. Am I right? So, what are we doing tonight?
Lori::: I'll see you tomorrow. 
7:::20 PM
Lori:::  Alone at last.
Lori:::  This is literally amazing.  Well, must be about bedtime.  Hmm...  Hey, Boo-Boo Bear. Tell me about your day.
Bobby::: Sorry, Babe. I'm really slammed at the store. 
Lori:::  Well, fine! I'm busy, too! So, bye! 
Yoga Instructor::: Now, gently rock forward as we go into Crab Pose.
Lori::: Hi, Mr. Grouse! Looks like we're going to be neighbors.
Mr. Grouse::: We're already neighbors.
Lori::: Closer neighbors. I moved into the garage.
Mr. Grouse::: I don't care. 
Lola::: Ugh. I can't get this tangle out of my hair! What am I supposed to do?
Lisa::: Fear not, sibling! As it happens, I've been working on a new detangling formula. 
Lola:::  MY HAIR!  WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Lisa::: You should have specified that you wanted to keep it. On a related note, may I keep it?
Lola::: This never would have happened if Lori was here!
Lori:::  Ah, finally, bedtime.  It's darker out here than I thought.
Lana::: Leni, I had a nightmare.
Leni::: It's okay. Tell me about it.
Lana:::  Well, first, the blood-sucking aliens were chasing me-
Leni:::  Did they see you come in here? Quick, help me with this dresser! 
Lana::: I wish Lori was here. She would make us feel safe.
Leni::: I know, but we can't bug her. She wants to be alone.
Lori:::  Bobby?
Bobby::: Hey, babe! How's Casa Lori?
Lori::: Terrible! This was a big mistake.
Bobby::: I'm sorry. Hey, why don't you just move back in with the family?
Lori::: I made such a big deal about wanting to be on my own. If I came crawling back now, they'd never let me live it down.
Bobby::: Oops! Babe, I gotta go. The exterminator's here. Papa thought he saw a mouse in the store. It might have been a moldy marshmallow, but we're not taking any chances.
Lori:::  A mouse, huh? Hmm...  Okay, guys, scatter!
Lori::: Ahem.  HELP!
Lynn Sr.::: What's wrong?
Lori:::  There are literally mice in here!
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, honey, I'm sure you're-  -MOVING BACK INTO THE HOUSE! THIS PLACE IS A HORROR SHOW!
Lori::: Oh, and I love it here so much. But if you say so. 
Lisa::: I have a better solution: my new ultrasonic mousetrap.  It works due to the simple-minded nature of the mice.  Not you, Leni!  Problem solved. And it's a win-win. I get new research subjects, and you get your beloved abode back.
Lori:::  Great.
Lori::: Dad, the mice are gone.
Lynn Sr.:::  Uh, yes, well, glad I could help. 
Lori::: Ahem. HELP! I'VE GOT A LEAK!
Rita::: Uh-uh. This is bad. You can't stay out here.
Lori:::  No!  You're probably right. 
Lana::: Don't worry, sis. I've got this.  BUCKET BRIGADE!
Lana::: I replaced the PVC with galvanized steel, so she should definitely hold now.
Lori:::  Great.
Lori::: You guys, help! I think the garage is haunted!  See?
Lucy::: GET OUT! Hmm...
Lucy:::  Let me do my thing.  Oh, spirit, speak to me. Hmm...  The ghost just explained everything.
Lori:::  There's really a ghost?  I mean, of course there's a ghost. And, clearly, he wants me to leave. 
Lucy::: Actually, he said you can stay. He's leaving. Something about yoga farts.
Lori:::  Okay, that was the floorboards!  There must be some way out of here.
Luan::: Dang it, Luna! Your fog machine warped Mr. Coconuts' head! 
Luna::: Can't prove it, dude!
Luan::: Lincoln, tell her she has to pay to get him fixed!
Lincoln::: Um...okay. Luna, I think Luan has a point. You should pay up.
Luna:::  You wanna think again, brah?
Lincoln::: Yes, I do. Luan, I think you should accept that fog machines are a part of life.
Mr. Coconuts::: I wouldn't be too hasty, Slick! My cousin's a baseball bat!
Lincoln:::  I wish Lori was here. She always has the right solution.
Mr. Grouse::: That's your solution? That I drive my tractor through your garage?
Lori::: Yes. In exchange for a tray of my dad's lasagna.
Mr. Grouse::: Well, what happens when your old man wants me to pay for the damage?
Lori::: I'll give you the money out of my allowance.
Mr. Grouse::: Hot dinner, and I get to wreck your dad's garage? Now that's a win-win!
Lori::: Let's say tonight around 7:00?
Luan::: Well, all done. I'd love to hang out and dish, but I'm sure you wanna go back to your place now.
Lori::: Uh, first, I should say goodnight to everyone.  Goodnight, Leni. Goodnight, Luna. Goodnight, Lynn. Goodnight, Lincoln.
Lola::: Move! You're blocking the TV!
Lori::: Pfft. Well, now I'm gonna have to start over. Goodnight, Leni. Goodnight, Luna. Goodnight, Lynn.
Lori:::  What was that?
Mr. Grouse::: Dang it! I put her in reverse by mistake and knocked down the wrong garage! Can I still have your dad's lasagna?
Lincoln:::  Knocked down the wrong garage?
Luna::: Dad's lasagna?
Luan::: Lori, you've got a ricotta explaining to do!  Get it?
Lori:::  Heh, heh. Well, I kind of maybe paid Mr. Grouse to wreck the garage so I wouldn't have to live there.
Lori::: I thought all I wanted was to be away from you guys. But I only ended up missing you. I was just too embarrassed to admit it.
Mr. Grouse::: Nice reunion, Louds! But what about my garage?
Lana:::  Call me. I'll give you a quote.
Bobby::: So, it turns out it wasn't a moldy marshmallow or a mouse. It was a chinchilla. I named it Lori.
Lori:::  Oh, Boo-Boo Bear, that's so sweet.  Wait. Is that like a rat?
Leni:::  Lori, what do you think?
Lori::: Love. You literally look like a model.
Lana::: Lori, can I sleep in your bed?
Lori::: Of course.  Boots off.
Lincoln::: Lori, tell Lisa she can't harvest my kidney!
Lisa::: Tell Lincoln he only requires one!  Now let's do this!
Lori::: Lisa, you took his appendix. Don't be greedy.
Luan::: Yeah, Lisa. Have a heart, but just not mine.  Get it?
Lola::: Lori, can you detangle?
Lori:::  You got it.  I really missed all of this.
