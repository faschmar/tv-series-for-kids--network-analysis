Lynn::: Who's ready for some football?!  Game time! Yeah! Whoo!
Luna:::  TV's all yours dude, just don't tackle us.
Football Announcer::: World championship of football.
Leni::: Huh? That ball looks nothing like a foot.
Lynn::: Guys, stay and watch with me, it's the world championship game, and the Lions are in it for the first time in twenty years baby!
Lola::: Okay, I don't know what any of that means.
Lynn::: Well, all the teams compete in this league and-
Lola:::  Ignorance is bliss sweetie.
Lynn::: Ah, come on,  I'll share my lucky cheese puffs.
Leni:::  Ew, the uniforms clash, I cannot watch this.
Luna::: Maybe I'll come back to see who's rockin' the half-time show.  Laters.
Lynn:::  Well Charles, looks like you're my sports buddy today.  Ah, you don't know what you're missin' mutt. Okay, cheering sections down to one, time for my pregame ritual.  Go Lions go! Go Lions go!  Left side lucky!  Alright Lions, let's do this
Football Announcer::: Touchdown Lions.
Lynn::: Ah yeah! High-five Loud.  You got it Loud.
Mr Grouse::: Ah yeah! Touchdown baby!
Lynn:::  What? Mr. Grouse?
Mr. Grouse:::  Whatever you're sellin' I'm not buyin'.
Lynn::: No! Mr. Grouse it's me! Lynn Loud!
Mr. Grouse:::  I'm not buyin' what you're sellin' either.
Lynn::: I just thought I heard you watching the game.
Mr. Grouse:::  Well you thought right. What of it?
Lynn::: Can I watch it with you?
Mr. Grouse::: I suppose it beats high-fiveing myself. Come on in, TVs in the den.
Lynn::: Huh, you have a den?
Mr. Grouse::: I don't have time for architectural small talk Loud, the game's on.
Lynn::: Woah-ho-ho-ho-ho! Are you kidding me? This room is sick! 
Mr. Grouse::: Well, I would have accepted a 'comfy', but, okay. Have a seat.
Lynn:::  Oh, in a sec.  Go Lions go! Go Lions go! 
Mr. Grouse::: What the heck are you doing?
Lynn::: It's my lucky ritual.
Mr. Grouse:::  Oh, brother.
Lynn::: Sorry, I need to sit on this side.
Mr. Grouse::: Let me guess, more luck?
Lynn::: Yup.
Mr. Grouse:::  I'm already regretting this.
Lynn:::  Do you have to make that sound?
Mr. Grouse::: Sorry, got a little pulled pork stuck in my chompers.
Mr. Grouse:::  You're getting cheese dust everywhere!
Lynn::: Want some?  My lucky hat!  Uh, you missed a spot.
Football Announcer::: And the Lions fumble.
Lynn::: Awe! Are you kidding me?!  Come on man, it's the world championship.
Mr. Grouse::: Ah, get off my case. I'll just rewind to see what I missed.
Lynn:::  What? we can't rewind, then we won't be live!
Mr. Grouse::: What's the difference?
Lynn::: You know, maybe it's better if I watch the rest of the game at home. 
Mr. Grouse::: Suit yourself.
Lynn:::  Ah! What happened?
Mr. Grouse::: We returned a kick, forty-one yards!
Lynn:::  Oh, dang! I missed it.
Mr. Grouse::: Hold on, I'll rewind it, if Queen Lynn doesn't object.
Lynn:::  Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!
Football Announcer::: D. Driver with a stiff arm, but it's in the Rhino territory, finally brought down after a forty-one yard return.
Lynn:::  Oh, man, that was a wicked run!
Mr. Grouse::: I know. Uh, you can sit back down, if you want.
Lynn::: Yeah, sure,  maybe just for a minute.
Lynn::: Yeah, baby!
Mr. Grouse::: Up top!
Mr. Grouse:::  Oh no...
Lynn::: Why-hy-hy... Oh, come on!
Mr. Grouse and Lynn::: Go, Lions, Go! Go, Lions, Go!
Mr. Grouse::: My back!
Football Announcer::: Ten seconds left, and the score is tied. If the Rhinos can move the ball close enough, they can make a field goal and win.  From the shotgun.  It's a Lions interception, and he's running it in for a touchdown. Lions win! The World Champions!
Lynn::: Don't just stand there G-man, shake it.  Dance or the Lions won't win next year.
Mr. Grouse::: What? That's utter nonsense.
Lynn::: It's not nonsense, it's fun. Just copy me. 
Mr. Grouse::: Eh, looks easy enough. I'll give it a try. 
Lynn::: Now you're doing it. 
Mr. Grouse:::  Eh heh, eh heh, eh heh, eh heh, eh heh...  Whoo-hoo! I feel so alive!
Lynn::: Thanks again for inviting me over.
Mr. Grouse::: Technically, you invited yourself. I just let you stay.
Lynn:::  Woah, cool ball.
Mr. Grouse::: That? That's my most prized possession. It's from the very first Lions game Mrs. Grouse and I went to when we were dating.
Lynn::: Huh, they had football back then?
Mr. Grouse:::  Yes, Miss Smarty Pants. Hey check this out, I got the QB to sign it. Look at that.
Lynn:::  He's in the hall of fame now.  I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy.
Mr. Grouse:::  Ah, Mrs. G was the only person I knew who was as big a Lions fan as me.  Until now.  You know what?  I want you to have this, Mrs. Grouse would want it to be in such good hands.
Lynn:::  Wow, thank you Mr. Grouse. This is the best gift I've ever gotten. I have to give you something special.  Here, my lucky socks.
Mr. Grouse:::  Wow, you wore these the whole season, didn't you?  Thanks Loud.
Lynn::: So, guess I'll see you next season?
Mr. Grouse::: You betcha.
Lynn:::  You know, baseball season is only a few weeks away.
Mr Grouse::: I was thinking the same thing. Opening day?
Lynn::: It's a date. 
Lynn::: Who's ready for some basebaaaall?!
Luna::: TV's all yours dude, just don't slap our butts.
Lynn::: Ah, thanks, but you guys can stay. I found a sports buddy so for the next hundred and eighty games, I'll be hangin' with Mr. Grouse. Laters! 
Lola::: Hmm, guess I taped this pillow to my butt for nothing.
Lynn::: Let's go volcanos!
Mr. Grouse::: Give 'em what for, meteors.
Lynn::: You're a Meteors fan?
Mr. Grouse::: You're a Volcano's fan? Awe!
Lynn::: But, they're bitter rivals.
Mr. Grouse:::  Eh, come on. We'll make it work.
Baseball Announcer::: Welcome to opening day, and the first of a three game series, between the Volcanoes and the Meteors.
Lynn::: You and your Meteors are going down.
Mr. Grouse::: In your dreams.
Lynn::: Ah yeah, base hit, game on.
Baseball Announcer::: Strike three, there is no stopping this Meteors pitcher.  And he's safe at home, one to nothing Volcanos.
Lynn::: Whoo! In your face, G-man!
Baseball Announcer::: And that ball is out of here, it's a two run homer.
Mr. Grouse:::  In your own face, kid.
Baseball Announcer::: Home run!  Meteors win!
Mr. Grouse::: Eh heh, eh heh, eh heh eh heh eh heh--
Lynn:::  Hey! Get your own ding-dang moves. That's my victory dance.
Mr. Grouse::: Well you won't need it as long as you're a Volcano's fan. 
Lynn:::  Ooh! That does it!  Here, you can have this back. I don't want any presents from traitors.
Mr. Grouse:::  Uh, fantastic. You can have your dumb smelly socks back too.
Lynn::: You know what?  We're done here. 
Mr. Grouse:::  We were done when you showed up in the wrong jersey.
Lola::: Ooh, you're watching baseball here? I thought Mr. Grouse was your sports buddy now.
Lynn::: Yeah, that didn't work out,  Cause someone's a traitor!
Mr. Grouse:::  Takes one to know one, Loud!
Lola:::  Drama.
Lynn::: Stay and watch the game with me Lols, I'll explain the rules to you.  See, there are nine defensive players on the diamond, and-
Lola:::  A diamond you say? How many karats is it? Who wears it? A pretty princess in a pink gown?
Lynn::: What? No, no, no. A diamond is another term for the field. Now the pitcher-
Lola:::  Yeah, no. You should stick with Mr. Grouse.
Baseball Announcer::: Welcome to game two of the Volcanos and the Meteors series.  Ooh, that's a shot, going back. That ball's outta here, a Volcano's home run!
Lynn::: Aw, yeah! Up high Loud!  You got it Loud. 
Baseball Announcer:::  And the fans are going crazy.
Baseball Announcer::: And the Meteors turn an incredible double play.
Mr. Grouse:::  Woohoo! Give 'em what for, Meteors!
Lynn::: Hey! Uh... Nice double play!
Mr. Grouse::: Thanks Loud! That was a sweet homer before!
Baseball Announcer::: Strike three-- and another Meteor goes down swinging.
Lynn::: --Whoo!  Gonna be a quick game if you guys can't hit.
Mr. Grouse::: Well I don't see your Vollame-os puttin' up any more runs.
Lynn:::  That was pretty good!
Baseball Announcer::: The Meteors are up to bat. Home run, Meteors! That ball is outta here!
Mr. Grouse::: That's what I'm talking about!  Awfully quiet over there, aren't ya?
Lynn::: Just giving you a chance to celebrate, 'cause you aren't gettin' another!
Mr. Grouse::: Are we gonna do this all day? Grab your cheese puffs and get over here!  If only your Volcanos could run bases as fast as you.
Baseball Announcer::: Another Meteor strikes out.
Lynn::: Whoo! I can feel the breeze from here.
Mr. Grouse:::  That's a good one.  I know baseball season just started, but uh, what are you doin' in the fall? You like hockey?
Lynn:::  Do I?!
