Lincoln:::  Tomorrow is April Fools' Day. Every year my sister Luan creates a prank apocalypse and no one is spared! I present to you Luan Loud's April Fools' Highlight Reel.
Luan::: I'd say this prank's a little over your head! 
Luan::: Seems to be your clucky day! 
Luan:::  I guess that's a wrap! 
Luan::: Aww, look at the Loud Family gettin' jiggly with it! 
Luan:::  I shaved the best for last! 
Lincoln::: See what I mean? Nobody's safe from that evil pranking genius. But this year's gonna be different. Luan is not gonna prank me, because I've got an April Fool proof plan.  You're not the only one who can make a pun, Luan! 
Lana::: Bubble-wrap me next!
Lucy:::  I need more armor.
Lynn:::  Where's my helmet!?
Lori:::  Bobby, we have to cancel all our plans in April.  Because Luan might shave my eyebrows off again! And it takes a month for them to grow back.
Luna:::  C'mon Lisa! Let me hunker in your bunker!
Lisa::: You should've been more prepared. We'd known this storm was coming for 364 days.
Luna:::  PLEASE! GIVE ME SHELTER!
Lola::: Arms up, Lincoln! Your turn for bubble-wrap.
Lincoln:::  Not this year, Lola. I'm not getting pranked.
Lola::: It's never been done!
Lynn::: Are you crazy?
Lincoln::: Ladies! Ladies! I got a plan! I'm simply gonna lock myself in my room till the day's over. I've got snacks, video games and a hose to pee in, which I call the Tinkle Tube. Patent pending.
Lori, Leni, Luna, Lynn, Lucy, Lola and Lily::: Ew!
Lana::: Cool!
Lincoln:::  It goes out the window! The point is, I'll never have to leave my room so Luan will never get me.
Luan::: Ooh! It's Pranksmas Eve...and I'm just bubbling with excitement. 
Lola::: I'm gonna need more bubble wrap! And a fresh pair of undies.
Lincoln::: Thanks for the lumber, Lana! I'll return it on April 2nd. 
Lana::: Mahogany was a good choice. That'll hold nicely.
Lincoln:::  Clyde, wanna hang out tomorrow? I built us a fortress with snacks, games and a Tinkle Tube. Patent pending.
Clyde::: On Pranksgiving? No way! Not after what happened last year.
Lincoln::: But nothing's gonna happen this year. I've got an April Foolproof plan.  Hang on Clyde, Ronnie Anne just texted me.  She said she's coming over tomorrow with a present for me.  She can't come over tomorrow! She'll get nailed by Luan's pranks and then pulverize me!
Clyde::: Just tell her to come over another day.
Lincoln::: I can't do that! That will definitely get me pulverized!
Clyde::: You gotta get Luan to call off Prankapalooza. Appeal to her humanity. Beg if you have to!
Lincoln::: Good idea! Just as soon as I get the Mahogany off the door!
Lincoln::: Luan! You gotta call off Prankageddon! Please! Ronnie Anne is coming over tomorrow and I can't let her get pranked!
Luan::: Okay.
Lincoln::: Really! Wow that was easier than I...
Luan::: APRIL FOOLS PRACTICE! Lincoln, you know the April Fools Rules. Anyone who sets foot on our property is fair game. Speaking of which, is Clyde coming over? 'Cause I'd love to just say HAY!!! 
Lincoln::: Clyde! Pleading with Luan did not work! She's an animal!  What was that?
Clyde::: Oh, that's Cleopawtra. She's been feisty lately so we put her in a timeout crate.
Lincoln::: Timeout crate. That's it!  Why did I choose Mahogany?
Lincoln:::  Okay, we're all here? Good! So, about Luan...
Lola::: Shh! She's got ears everywhere!  I saw this in a mob movie once. She won't hear us over the noise.
Lincoln::: We all know tomorrow is going to be awful. But it doesn't have to be. If we combine forces, we can prevent Luan from setting up any pranks in the first place.
Lynn::: Uhhh, how exactly are we gonna do that?
Lincoln::: Let me tell you my plan.
Lisa::: Better make it snappy. We're almost done with the spin cycle.
Luan:::  LET ME  OUT OF HERE!
Lincoln::: Okay.
Luan:::   Really? Wow! That was easier than I...
Lincoln::: APRIL FOOLS! We aren't letting you out until April 2nd! 
Lynn::: That was a crate plan, Lincoln! 
Lori::: I've been crating for this moment all my life! 
Lana::: Well, better crate than never! 
Leni::: You're in a crate!  Get it?
Lincoln::: Maybe we should just go to bed.
Lola:::  We're doomed! Luan escaped, and now she's gonna be mad!
Lincoln::: How could this have happened?!
Luna::: She's a black magic woman, dude!
Lincoln:::  I gotta get my money back for these.
Lisa::: Peace out. I'll be in my bunker. 
Lincoln::: Everyone else to my room! We'll be safe there.
Lynn Sr.::: What's all this ruckus about?
Lori::: Luan's on the loose! TAKE COVER!
Rita::: But we thought you locked her up!
Lynn Sr.::: Plan B! RETREAT! RETREAT! 
Lincoln:::  Oh no! Ronnie Anne's on her way? Could this day get any worse?  Well, that's my answer. But on the plus side, that's one less prank Ronnie Anne could suffer.  That's it! If I set off all the pranks in the house, there won't be any left for her.
Lynn::: Lincoln! It's not safe out there!
Lincoln::: Save yourselves! I got a job to do.
Lucy::: Don't worry, Lincoln, I'll plan your funeral.
Lincoln::: I'll start by de-pranking the kitchen.
Lincoln::: Kitchen this way? Ha! Does she think I'm dumb enough to fall for that?
Lincoln::: Well, here goes nothing.
Lincoln::: OW!
Luan:::  I made that dish from scratch! 
Rita:::  Lisa Marie Loud! Let us in!
Lisa::: I'll need some of your assurances in return! One, I will never again be punished for the explosions in or around the house!
Luan:::  Happy April Stools! 
Rita::: Are those diapers? She wouldn't!
Lisa:::  Sign here, here and initials here.
Lincoln:::  Ha!  Uh oh!  Towel! Towel! Towel! Where's the towel? 
Luan::: Don't give up, no one likes a critter! 
Lori::: I think if we ration the food, we should be okay.
Lana::: What does 'ration' mean? 
Lola:::  Typical! Now someone has to go into the kitchen for more supplies!
Lana:::  Let's draw straws!
Leni:::  I'll just go. I know I'm gonna lose. I'm a terrible artist.
Lucy::: Actually, that's not what-
Lola:::  Good luck, Leni! 
Leni:::  Kitchen this way? Oh. Thank you, sign!  Thank you, sign!  Thank you, sign! Thank you, sign!
Lincoln:::  Okay. Living room. So far, so good.
Lincoln::: I think this is how you kiss a girl. 
Clyde::: Don't hold back, Lincoln. Girls like a guy with passion!
Lincoln::: I can't let Ronnie Anne see this!  Stop! Stop! 
Luan::: Looks like spring is in the air. 
Lincoln:::  Just got to finish the bedrooms! 
Clyde::: Lincoln! What's happening? Lucy just invited me to your funeral!
Lincoln:::  OW!! I've been setting off all the pranks in the house so Ronnie Anne doesn't get hit.  I've gone through every room except Leni and Lori's.  Clyde? Hello?
Clyde::: I volunteer to clear Lori's room.  It was worth it. Lori's room smells like apple cinnamon.
Lincoln::: That might be this pie.  Well, that's it. The Loud House is prank free! 
Luan:::  I won! You thought you'd outsmart me, but you got the worst pranking ever!
Lincoln::: You didn't really win, Luan. I only set off the pranks because Ronnie Anne was coming over. 
Luan::: Yeah! Well who do you think invited her over, genius?  I knew I had to lure you out of your room, so I called Ronnie Anne, and told her how much you love April Fools' Day. And here she is, to deliver the final blow.
Lincoln::: Huh?  But why'd you do that?
Ronnie Anne::: You took all those pranks for me. It's the least I could do. Come on, let's draw some eyebrows on you and go get a milkshake.
Luan::: That girl's a keeper!
Lynn Sr.::: I think it's over!
Rita::: Wait! Where's Leni?
Lisa:::  I have my suspicions.
Lynn Sr.::: Okay, everybody in the van. Let's find Leni, and then afterwards, frozen yogurt to celebrate! Ha-ha!
Everyone:::  LUAN!
Luan:::  Aw, the end of April Fools always make me feel a little blue.  Get it?
