Lori::: The Petoskey Open comes down to this. In the first tournament of her college career, Lori Loud has a chance to win it all for Fairway U.  And the crowd goes wild! Woo-hoo-hoo! 
Bobby:::  Great shot, Babe. I think? It's kind of dark. Maybe you should call it a night.
Lori::: I can't, I need to keep practicing. I'm the only freshman on the team and if I don't do well, I could lose my scholarship.
Bobby::: Sorry I'm not there to give you a big hug.
Lori::: Aww. Thanks, Boo-Boo Bear.
Vito:::  Hey! Youse two love birds finished? I've been waiting for 15 minutes. My spumoni's melting!
Bobby::: Aw, Sorry, Babe. I gotta go. Don't worry. You're gonna do great.
Lori::: Huh? That's weird.  Did you do this?  Hello? Anyone here?  Huh? Maybe I've been practicing a little too much.
Lori::: OK. And these are all the books you have on putting greens. I need to know every blade of grass on that tournament course. I'm under a ton of pressure.
Librarian::: Shhh! I'm a librarian, not a counsellor.
Lori::: What. Is. Happening?!  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!  Oh, I know, I know, I know. Shh.  It wasn't me!  Ow.
Lori::: It's just nerves. A little iced tea and a little lemonade, and I will be fine. Hello? Anyone here? I just wanted to get an Arnold Palmer.  I'm sorry! 
Lori::: No ghost is jumping out of my mini-fridge. 
Female Dorm Mate::: Lori? Everything okay in here?
Lori:::  There was a mosquito on it. 
Female Dorm Mate:::  OK. 
Lori:::  You're losing it, Loud. You need help. Think! Who're you gonna call?
Hunter::: ARGGH! This is one tricky ghost. If I'm going to catch it, I'll need my officially-licensed Hunter Spector phantasmal glasses,  my trusty spirit translator,  and of course, my ghost phaser.  Look out! A ghost!
Clyde::: This is Clyde.
Lori::: Clyde, it's Lori. I have a big-time problem on my hands, and I need your help.
Clyde::: Lori, I think you have the wrong number. This is Clyde... McBride.
Lori::: I know. And also, I know you're the brains of the Clincoln McCloud operation, which is why I called you and not Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Um, Lori,  you're on speaker.
Lori::: Oh. Sorry. I guess you can help, too. Listen, I think there's a ghost on campus that's haunting me, and I need your ghost-hunting expertise to get rid of it.
Clyde:::  A ghost?! We've been waiting our whole lives for this call!
Lori::: I can't tell anyone here because I don't want them to think I'm losing it. Which is why I'm gonna need you guys to be discrete.
Lincoln:::  Don't worry. Discrete is what we're all about.
Lincoln::: Let's go get that ghost! 
Clyde::: Wait. Let me try one. That ghost is gonna be toast. 
Lynn Sr.::: Lincoln, you left one of your blasty toys!
Lincoln:::  Be cool, Dad. It's called a ghost phaser.
Lynn Sr.:::  Hey, there's my girl! 
Lori::: Hey, Dad. OK, Dad. Time to go.
Lynn Sr.:::  OK. OK, bye, kids! Have fun! Lori, there's a lasagna in Lincoln's toy bag.
Lincoln:::  Dad, it's not-
Lori::: You guys are literally saving my life. I'm so freaked out that I'm starting to lose my hair. 
Lincoln::: Heh, I noticed.
Lori:::  We need to get rid of this ghost quickly and quietly so I can focus on the tournament.
Clyde::: Clear. No spectral activity over here.
Lori::: My new caddy. 
Lori::: So, this is the first place that I saw the ghost.
Lincoln:::  Clyde, I found something over here!  Blegh! It's even grosser than I thought! Awesome!
Lori::: What is it?
Clyde::: Ectoplasmic residue!  Ghost goop.
Lincoln::: I'll take some for further study. 
Lori::: We need to go.
Male Golf Student::: So he blows the putt for bogey, and then I'm all like, 'Scrap the blade and use the rest...'
Lincoln and Clyde:::  Clear!
Lori:::  Would you put those away? There are people in here.  This is the spot where the ghost Arnold Palmered me.
Lincoln::: All I'm getting is floor wax and-  Eugh! Somebody stepped in something!
Clyde::: The special evidence has obviously been mopped away. We'll have to recreate the splash patterns to see what type of ghost we're dealing with.
Lincoln:::  Hmm. Did it splash you like this?  Or more like this? 
Lori::: Neither! It didn't throw the drink at me!
Clyde::: Oh. So maybe more like this?  Oops. Sorry.
Lori:::  We were just leaving.
Janitor::: Huh?  
Lori::: Guys, remember, this is a library, so I need you to be extra quiet.
Lincoln:::  Got it.
Lori:::  Guys, what did I just say?!
Librarian::: Shhh!
Lori::: Hi again.  This is where the ghost started hurling books at me.  Yeah, just like that.
Clyde::: I'll save you, Lori!
Lori:::  No!
Lori:::  Don't shoot me, Clyde, shoot the ghost!
Clyde::: There it is!
Lincoln:::  I've got you now, ghost. Ready, aim... 
Lori:::  Gah! It's in non-fiction! Now it's in biographies!  It's headed to the romance section! No wait... it's coming back!
Lincoln and Clyde:::  That was awesome!
Lori::: Oh, it's getting away! Follow it!  Uh, so sorry.  Uh, maybe this will help? Uh, gotta go!
Lori::: Seriously?! It had to go into the dark and creepy woods?!
Clyde::: Here, Lori! This spirit-protection cloak will keep you safe!
Lori::: Um, this is just an ARGGH! hoodie. Oh, well, it's worth a shot.
Clyde::: I-I think it's trying to communicate with us!
Lincoln::: I'll use a spirit translator!
Hunter Spector::: Don't forget to watch ARGGH!cast.
Clyde::: That can't be right.
Lincoln::: Less talking, more blasting.
Clyde::: Ready...
Lincoln::: Aim...
Clyde::: Our batteries must have died!
Lincoln:::  That's it! Listen up, ghost! You need to leave my sister alone. You're really scaring her, it's super messed up, and you should feel awful about yourself!
Clyde::: It's working! The ghost responds to shame and guilt, just like me!
Lincoln:::  Leave Lori Loud alone!
Clyde:::  Leave Lori Loud alone!
Lincoln and Clyde:::  Leave Lori Loud alone! Leave Lori Loud alone!
Clyde::: We did it!
Lincoln::: We drove the ghost away!
Lori:::  Thank you! I knew you could do it, Clyde! Lincoln, I had my doubts, but you really pulled through.
Lincoln::: Thank you, I think...?
Lori::: Finally, I can focus on getting ready for the tournament. 
Lincoln::: Hey, where did you get that cookie?
Lori::: It was in the pocket.
Clyde:::  That's where I put that!
Raj::: Sorry about that, Lori. Everyone's game is a bit off today.
Coach Niblick::: Good heavens! I don't know what's going on with you people, but the Petoskey Open is tomorrow, and we positively stink!
Raj::: It's Shanks, Coach. He hasn't been around all day and it's really messing with our game.
Lori::: Um, who's Shanks?
Raj::: Um, come with me, Lori.  Have a seat. Usually, we wait until after the first tournament to tell freshmen about this. Shanks Bogey is Fairway's golf whisperer. He's like a good-luck charm, an advisor, caddy, and friend all in one.  The year was 1900. Fairway U was in the National Championship and losing badly. That is, until their caddy Shanks rallied them. He carried six golf bags at a time that day. He knew exactly which club to use on every hole. He would do anything for the team. He was such a fixture at the school that they offered him a full-time gig as caddy after graduation, and he's been helping the golf team at Fairway ever since...  ...even in the afterlife.
Lori::: So wait, you're saying Shanks is a...
Raj::: That's right. He's a ghost.  I know. It sounds crazy, huh?
Lori::: Not exactly.
Raj::: He didn't come to practice today and that's very unlike him. We really depend on Shanks, Lori. I'm afraid that if he doesn't show up, we might never win again.
Lori:::  Oh no. What have I done?! 
Lincoln::: Hmm?  Go for Linc.
Lori::: Lincoln, I need you and Clyde to come back to Fairway. And can you get Mom to drive you? Dad kind of made a scene last time.
Lynn Sr.:::  You're on speakerphone... 
Lori:::  Yeah, why does everyone keep doing that?
Lincoln::: What's the crisis, Lori?
Lori::: You know that ghost you guys drove away? I need him back. Apparently he's, like, the team's good luck charm.
Lincoln::: Well, we'd love to help, but we're in the ghost-busting biz, not the ghost-friending biz.
Lori:::  Lincoln, without him, my team is gonna lose the Petoskey Open and every other tournament we play. My golf career will be over, which means I lose my scholarship, not to mention my hair is still falling out!  I think my teeth are next. One of my molars feels loose!
Lincoln::: Lori, you're spiraling!
Lori::: I know. I literally need help!
Mortician's Club::: Light as a feather, stiff as a Boris.  Light as a feather, stiff as a Boris.
Lincoln::: Hmm. I might know a few people who could bring back your ghost.
Lucy::: Did you say ghost?
Boris::: Oof.
Lori::: Uhhh, huh... Newer caddies. 
Lucy::: Good morrow, sister.
Lori:::  Can we, like, hurry this up and get inside?
Lucy::: Gasp! We lost Boris!
Boris::: Mmm... this does not look good for Boris...
Cheerleader 1::: OMG, that was, like, so awesome!
Boris::: Many apologies for interrupting your human stacking ritual. Boris will leave now.
Cheerleader 2::: Don't go, we need a new flyer.
Cheerleader 1::: Wow! You have, like, totally amazing balance.
Boris:::  Oh, thank you. It must be my hollow bones.
Lucy:::  “I think I found your ghost. I was able to dig up this old Fairway yearbook from 1900.”
Lori:::  “Shanks Bogey, that's him!”
Lucy::: “Armed with this most intimate info, it's time we made contact with Shanks, and let him know he's dearly missed at Fairway.”  “'tis a time to putt, a time to play through. Dear spirit of Shanks, we summon thee back to Fairway U.”
Mortician's Club::: “Tis a time to putt, a time to play through. Dear spirit of Shanks…”
Everyone:::  “..we summon thee back to Fairway U.”
Lori:::  Look! Is that Shanks?
Lucy::: Sigh.
Lori:::  This smells worse than Lynn's feet.
Lucy::: That's the fermented bean meal. Dr. Flickenlooper's dyspeptic bread was a dietary staple at the turn of the century when Shanks was alive.
Haiku::: It's a peace offering. Shanks listed it as a favorite food. That, and pigs in a blanket.
Lori::: Um, why didn't we just make those?
Lucy::: When Shanks comes for the bread, this will alert us to his presence. Now we wait.
Morpheus::: Hey, where's Boris?
Persephone::: I'm sure he's just resting in his coffin. 
Lucy::: The bell has tolled. Our peace offering worked.
Lori::: Our bread!
Raj::: Wow. You made this, Lori? It's really good. 
Lori::: Dante?!
Dante::: Yeah. It's delicious.  I'm afraid a dark storm is brewing in my belly. 
Raj:::  Lori, what did you do to us?! 
Lucy::: It's not your fault, Lori. It's the bean meal.
Lucy:::  According to the yearbook, Shanks was part of a campus theater group called the Yips. I even had Dante learn his favorite song.  Now grab your cane, Lori. If we party like it's 1900, Shanks will surely show up.
Lori::: This is actually kinda fun! 
Lucy::: This is a good sign. Keep dancing! It must be working!  He has arrived.  Speak to us, Shanks!  Hiss!
Morpheus::: Oh no! This must be some normie sacrifice ritual!
Boris::: Boris got spirit. How about you?
Haiku::: Clearly we've summoned the wrong kind of spirit.
Boris::: Ready, break! 
Persephone::: What was that?
Lucy::: Is everyone okay?
Lori::: Well, this is a bust. What's next?
Lucy::: Sadly, sister,  this was my last idea.
Lori:::  That's it. Shanks isn't gonna show up tomorrow. I'm gonna have to tell everyone what I did and they're gonna kick me off the team.
Lucy::: Wait. Look at the ball. Do you see that?
Lori:::  Huh, that's literally the same glow I saw from the ghost!
Lucy::: Of course! Fractured mirrors are the best way to see into the spirit world.
Persephone::: So where in the spirit world is Shanks?
Lucy::: The spirits are showing me a cemetery with a strange affinity towards... golf?
Lori::: That looks like the old cemetery near campus!
Haiku::: This school is so creepy. I want to go here.
Lucy::: Now that we know where he is, we can convince him to come back.
Lori::: Wait!  Maybe I should go alone.
Lucy:::  What? You're terrified of ghosts.
Lori::: I know, but I'm the one who drove Shanks away. I must have really offended him, and I have to make things right. So I'm just gonna face my fears and go into the  dark, cold, spooky, desolate, cemetery.
Mortician's Club::: Lucky.
Lori::: It's fine. It's fine. It's all gonna be fine. Nothing scary here-  Oh. Hey, little buddy. Have you seen any spirits around here?  Okay.  “Hello? Mr. Bogey? Can I call you Shanks?”  “I'm not quite sure of the proper way to greet a ghost. I just came here to tell you, I'm sorry. I had no idea how important you were to Fairway. And I never should have scared you off. So I guess this is me asking you to… please come back.”  “Well, that didn't work.”  “But as long as I'm here, might as well play a hole.”  “Huh, this pitching wedge oughta do it. Right, Shanks?”  “Oh, am I using the wrong club? Would you suggest I try something else?”  “A nine-iron, huh?”  “Whoa, good call on the nine-iron.”  “Yeah, I literally have no idea how to play this one.”  “Play it off the tree? If you say so.”  “Yes! Nice caddying, Shanks.”  “Okay, that was terrifying. But I still got a hole in one!”   “So, does that mean you're coming back to Fairway?”  “Look, Shanks, the thing is, the Petoskey Open is tomorrow and the team really needs you. If you don't wanna come back for me, at least come back for them. Please?”  “Okay then, sorry I bothered you.” 
Announcer:::  “It all comes down to this. Everything rests on the shoulders of Lori Loud. Can a freshman with zero tournament experience win it for Fairway?”  “Ooh, I just jinxed her, didn't I?”
Lori::: “Come on, Loud. You can do this.”  “Gah, how am I supposed to make the shot with the sun in my eyes?”
Announcer::: She did it! It's a miracle shot! Fairway wins the Petoskey! Lori Loud will be allowed to show her face around campus without shame!
Lori:::  “Huh?”  “Thank you, Shanks.”
Lincoln::: Yeah!
Lynn Sr.::: That's my daughter!
Boris::: “I've got spirit! Yes, it's true! Let's give it up for Fairway U!” 
Lucy::: Sigh. I don't think Boris is coming home with us.
