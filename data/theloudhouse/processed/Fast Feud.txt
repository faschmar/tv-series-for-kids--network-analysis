Jim Sparkletooth:::  And that's what happens to crooked vendors who sell knock-off ice cream bars. I'm Jim Sparkletooth, coming for your dirty secret, next.
Carl:::  That guy's my hero.
Ronnie Anne::: Abuela, why are you frying burgers? We already had dinner.
Hector:::  Ooh, are we having second dinner?
Rosa:::  Mi cocina is closed for the night.
Bobby::: Check it out, that new burger joint just opened across the street. I was one of the first fifty customers.  I got a free burger bib, burger hat, burger flavored toothpaste.
Rosa:::  That explains the smell Mija. Hector, close the window.
Hector::: What's the hurry?
Bobby::: And, they sing a super catchy song every time they get a tip.
Ronnie Anne::: That's great, Bobby. Alright, I'm going to bed, good night everybody.
Ronnie Anne::: Ugh, that must be the tip song.
Padma:::  Okay Pierre! Turn on the sign!
Rosa:::  What's going on? I thought I heard an intruder.
Hector:::  Is everything okay?
Ronnie Anne:::  That burger sign has turned my room into some sort of fast food tanning booth. How am I supposed to sleep?
Rosa:::  I know what will fix this.
Ronnie Anne:::  Abuelo, doesn't this bother you?
Hector::: Sorry Mija, I've lived in the city a long time, I can sleep through anything.
Rosa::: These blackout shades should help, try to get some sleep Mija.  Come on Hector.
Ronnie Anne::: Ah! What a terrible nightmare.
Sid::: Sorry if I'm cranky today, I got zero sleep last night.
Ronnie Anne::: Let me guess... Burger Blast?
Sid::: Yes. The light, the smells, the...  Burger song.
Ronnie Anne:::  Burger song.  I can't go through that again, we have to do something. Maybe if we went over there and talked to them, they would turn down their sign.
Sid:::  Forget it it's too far.
Ronnie Anne:::  No, we're doing this. Come on.
Customer::: Right here, yeah.
Burger Machine::: Burger Blast! 
Ronnie Anne::: Those must be the owners, let's go talk to them.
Padma::: Welcome to Padma Blast, I mean Blurger Bast.  What can I get you?
Pierre:::  Padma, the ketchup alarms are going off. We're low!
Padma::: I know, Pierre, I can hear. Go get the emergency ketchup! Sorry, kids. Was that two burgers?
Ronnie Anne::: Um, uh, no, we wanted to talk to you about your burger sign.
Sid::: It's kinda bright, and it makes it hard to sleep.
Padma::: Uh, excuse me one sec.  Oh no no no no no!
Pierre::: Oh, don't worry, it's just ketchup. What can I get ya?
Ronnie Anne::: Well... we don't normally complain, but since you've opened--
Pierre::: Oh, you have a complaint? Oh, no problem. Put it in the complaint jar and we'll get right on it.
Sid:::  Your sign is too bright. Your smells are too strong. Your singing is too loud.  But, your complaint jar is nice.  See? I told you I'm cranky today. 
Ronnie Anne::: Maybe it's the lack of sleep, but I think the burger sign got brighter last night.
Sid::: I know. And the fry smell definitely got stronger too.  It's still in my hair. Do you think they're messing with us?
Ronnie Anne::: Yeah, just 'cause we're kids. Well, we tried being nice. Now it's time to play hardball.
Sid::: Yeah! Do we need helmets for hardball?
Ronnie Anne::: No, but we do need a Carl.
Ronnie Anne::: So we tried to talk to them, but they didn't listen. We don't know what else to do. Can you help us?
Carl::: I have a few ideas. But your free five-minute consultation is over. That'll be twenty to deal with the sign, thirty for the song, and sixty for the smell.
Ronnie Anne::: We have five.
Carl::: I also offer payment plans.
Ronnie Anne::: So, where's your guy who's supposed to be helping us, Carl?
Sid:::  Anyone want a smore? 
Carl::: Relax, he'll be here soon, with the tarp to cover the sign. Problem solved.  Look! There he is!
Ronnie Anne::: Sergio<nowiki>'</nowiki>s your guy?
Carl::: Don't worry, he's very dependable.
Sergio::: What? A hot dog spill on 39<sup>th</sup> Street? I'm out.
Carl::: No! DON'T DROP IT YET!!
Carl::: Okay, new plan. This place is gonna get shut down when the inspector sees how unsafe it is.
Ronnie Anne::: How do you know which one is the inspector?
Carl:::  They always have a clipboard. Operation Slip and Fall is on! 
Carl:::  Ow! The pain! I'm so young...  Oh, the tragedy!
Padma:::  Oh, I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
Carl:::  I'll survive...  ...But this spilled mustard does make me wonder...  Should this place be shut down?  Mrs. Inspector, what do you think? Is this restaurant a hazard to public health?
Clipboard Woman::: Who, me? Oh, I'm not an inspector, I'm just filling out a job application.
Pierre::: Would a free Smiley Meal make you feel better?
Carl::: Does it come with a toy?  Yep, I'm good!
Ronnie Anne::: What do you think Sid? Should we just hope they go out of business?
Sid::: It'll never happen! Everyone loves their burgers!  I think we're just destined to never, sleep, again.
Carl:::  Mmm! They are delicious--  'Vete. Vete! Vete, Sancho!  That's my burger!  Wait a minute... Sancho's giving me a great idea. I think it's time to give Jim Sparkletooth a call.
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, Sergio and his friends should be here any minute.
Sid::: Same with Sparkletooth.
Pierre::: Hey Padma, the new electrician dimmed the sign. It looks great!
Padma::: Oh, good.
Ronnie Anne::: U-uh, excuse me? Did we just hear you say that you've dimmed your sign?
Padma::: Oh, hi girls! Yes, sorry it took us so long, we've just been really busy,  and Pierre thought he could fix everything himself.
Pierre::: Hey! I'm handy. 
Padma::: He made everything worse. But I finally hired a pro.
Rosa::: All finished!
Rosa::: Hello chiquitas! I dimmed the burger sign and put in some fans for the smell so you can stop complaining. I also added vinegar to their ketchup! It needed it. 
Padma::: She is a lifesaver! Anyway, we also took Tommy out of the tip song rotation. That guy does not have an inside voice.
Tommy:::  ORDER FOR VITO! WOW, YOU MUST BE HUNGRY!
Ronnie Anne::: Whoa, thank you so much. Could you excuse us for a second?
Ronnie Anne::: Oh no Sid, they were taking care of everything all along!
Sid::: I know! They're lovely! And we're about to rain pigeon fury on them...
Ronnie Anne:::  We have to call it off. Sergio, come in! Abort the mission! I repeat, abort the mission!
Ronnie Anne:::  Sergio, come in... the mission. Repeat... the mission!
Sergio::: I don't copy. Coming in hot!
Ronnie Anne::: Sergio, did you get that?
Jim Sparkletooth::: Hello, I'm Jim Sparkletooth. We're at the popular new restaurant Burger Blast, where I've uncovered another... dirty secret: Their burgers are made... from pigeon meat.  Tell us: Why are you using pigeon meat, and how do you sleep at night? 
Padma::: What?! How dare you! We don't use pigeon...
Horrified customer::: The... the PIGEONING!!!
Sid:::  ... STOP, PLEASE!
Ronnie Anne:::  Pigeons...
Jim Sparkletooth::: I'm Jim Sparkletooth, and I'll be coming for your dirty secret, next, just like that. 
Padma::: ...Don't touch that!! This doesn't make any sense! Where are these pigeons coming from?! Aaagh!
Pierre::: As soon as this ends, WE'RE RUINED!
Ronnie Anne::: Not if we can help it!  Sid, come on! I got an idea.
Ronnie Anne::: Mr. Snaggletooth? We're the ones who called about the pigeon meat.
Jim Sparkletooth::: What? Huh? Oh, I see what this is about... You want your 25 dollars for the story tip. Okay,  Start the car.
Sid::: It's not about the money! We just don't want you to air the story.
Jim Sparkletooth::: Fat chance! This is gonna get me promoted.
Ronnie Anne::: Mmm... Well, what if I told you we have a better story?  Even juicier.
Jim Sparkletooth::: Juicier than pigeon meat? I'm listening...
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, it's on!
Jim Sparkletooth::: And now...  Deception.  Debauchery.<!-- ? -->  I'm Jim Sparkletooth, and I've uncovered a hard hitting story of burgers, sabotage, and pigeon meat. Just how far would two vengeful tweens go to get some sleep?
Sid::: Hey.
Ronnie Anne::: 'Vengeful tweens'?
'Jim Sparkletooth::: This eyewitness saw it all.
Carl::: They forced me to bring pigeons, and pretend they were in the hamburgers! THEY'RE MONSTERS! ...Y-you're gonna change my voice, right?
Jim Sparkletooth::: 'Monsters,' you can say that again.
Ronnie Anne::: Hey!  Okay, maybe we deserved that. But the more important thing is that everybody knows the truth. My friend Sid and I made up the pigeon meat rumour.
Sid:::  We just needed sleep!  But it was all just a misunderstanding.
Ronnie Anne::: We're sorry Pierre and Padma. You guys are awesome and we're looking to have you as neighbours.
Pierre:::  Don't forget: we make our own ketchup and our burgers are made from beef! Delicious beef!
Jim Sparkletooth::: I'm Jim Sparkletooth, coming for your dirty secret, next.  Aah! Uh... Stop the camera! Aah, DON'T LOOK AT ME!--
Rosa::: I'm proud of you girls for doing the right thing... Eventually.
Ronnie Anne::: Thanks, Abuela.  Who knew their burgers were so delicious? 
Hector::: And they even deliver now. 
Burger Machine::: Burger Blast!
