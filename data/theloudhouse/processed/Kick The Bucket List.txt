Lincoln:::  I know this looks a little weird, but I'm doing it for a reason. Today's the first day of spring break, and to ensure we make the most of it, Clyde and I came up with this!  Ew! Note to self: don't ever borrow Lynn's tracksuit again. I meant, we came up with this!  Clincoln McLoud's Totally Awesome and Rad Spring Break Bucket List (Patent Pending). It's a totally awesome and rad list of all the rad and awesome things Clyde and I wanna do over the nine days of spring break.  We've been working on this baby since Christmas break ended, and that's why I'm stretching. With so many activities to get through, we can't afford to cramp up.  That's enough stretching for now. 
Lincoln::: Hey, buddy! Where's your tracksuit?
Clyde::: Uh, Lincoln...
Lincoln::: It's cool. I brought a spare.  I also took care of breakfast.
Clyde::: Uh, Lincoln...
Lincoln:::  Doughnuts!
Clyde::: Lincoln!
Lincoln:::  Yes, yes, I know, Clyde. You need your fiber, and that's why I packed fruit, too.
Clyde::: Lincoln, my dads and I are going to Hawaii for eight days. They just surprised me.
Lincoln:::  What?!
Clyde::: Oh. Sorry about the air horn.
Lincoln::: NOOOOOOOOO!!!  Wait. Did you say eight days? Spring break is nine days, which means we'll still have one day left when you get back to do everything on our list!
Lincoln and Clyde::: YES!!!
Clyde::: Of course, we'll have to pare down the list a little.
Lincoln::: Of course.
Lincoln and Clyde:::  List Pare-Down Mode activated!
Lincoln::: So, what'd ya cut?
Clyde:::  Um...nothing. I actually added an activity.
Lincoln::: Well, you did better than me. I added two.
Lincoln::: This is gonna be the most awesome and rad day ever!
Rita::: Just make sure you're home before the streetlights come on; tomorrow's a school day.
Lincoln::: No problem, Mom.
Clyde:::  Hmm...that gives us eight hours. Think we'll be able to get all this done?
Lincoln:::  Clyde, we have to! Though we'll need to do more stretching.
Lincoln and Clyde::: OW!
Lincoln::: One's good.
Lincoln::: First activity: Catch up on all the episodes of ARGGH! we've recorded.
Clyde::: Sounds awesome and rad to me.
Lincoln:::  42 episodes?! Hmm...we may have to speed things up a bit. 
Hunter Spector::: Greetings, ghost hunters! I'm Hunter Spector, and...
Clyde:::  Excuse me... 
Lincoln::: I'll tell you how it ends!  No I won't! 
Lincoln::: Okay, the awesome radness continues with item number two: Ride the newest ride at Dairyland, Fly Me To The Moo.
Clyde::: Expected wait time from this point...
Lincoln::: 3 days?!
Customers::: Hey!. What?. What are you doing?
Lincoln::: Ride inspectors coming through. Excuse us.
Clyde::: It worked!
Ride operator::: Alright, you two, no line cutting!  And stay out!
Clyde::: Well, we kinda flew there for a second.
Lincoln::: I'd say it counts.
Clyde::: Play with puppies. This should be rad.
Lincoln::: And awesome!
Clerk::: Sorry, boys. The puppies are being bathed right now. But you can play with Petey over there.
Clyde:::  Maybe we should skip this one.
Lincoln::: We can't. It's on the list.  Pretty bird.
Clyde::: Maybe we shouldn't have touched his egg.
Lincoln::: The important thing is, we can check it off the list.
Lincoln:::  Ah, a leisurely carriage ride through the park was a great idea, Clyde. Glad you added it to the list.
Clyde::: Thanks.  But I think we're gonna have to pick up the pace a little.
Lincoln::: On the bright side, we're still technically riding a carriage through the park!
Lincoln::: This is awesome! I've always wanted to swim in gelatin.
Clyde::: How long does it take to set?
Lincoln:::  Let's see...20 minutes per 4 ounces of water, and this is a 100-gallon pool, so you gotta carry the 1...
Clyde:::  HEY! It's spring break! We shouldn't be doing math.
Lincoln::: You're right. Besides, we have a list to get through.
Lincoln::: The good news is, the internet says the color isn't permanent. The bad news is, it's 1:00, and we're not even halfway through the list.
Clyde::: Maybe we need to split up. Then we'll get the list done in no time.
Lincoln::: Good thinking.  You take the rad, I'll take the awesome.
Luan::: Orange you glad you thought of that? It's quite an a-peeling idea.  Get it?  Oh, wait! Citrus self down! I was just getting to the juicy part! Okay, Vitamin C ya later! Man, I'm on fire!
Lincoln::: A-five, six, seven, eight!
Luna::: Yo, whatcha up to, little bro?
Lincoln:::  Having a jam session?
Luna::: Righteous! I'll grab my ax.
Lincoln::: Sorry. It's a me and Clyde thing.
Luna:::  You and Clyde? Uh...okay, bro. 
Leni::: Hey, Clyde. Do you need a partner?
Clyde::: No, thanks. It's a me and Lincoln thing.
Leni:::  Oh. Hi, Lincoln. 
Clyde::: Here we go, buddy. 
Twins::: YOU RUINED OUR SANDCASTLE!!!
Leni::: Lincoln, can you watch the twins? I have to go to the bathroom.
Lynn::: Sweet. A 6-footer.
Lincoln::: Sorry, Lynn. It's a me and Clyde thing.
Lynn::: Thanks, bro.
Clyde::: Excuse me, ma'am. Would you mind taking a photo of me and my best friend?
Scoots::: Normally, I'd say no, but since your best friend's a rock, I kinda feel sorry for you.
Scoots:::  How do you work this thing?
Phone::: I'm sorry, Clyde. I didn't get that.
Clyde:::  Uh...can you hurry? My friend is kinda heavy.
Phone::: Okay, I found three results for heavy.
Clyde::: Ah! Rock Lincoln!
Scoots:::  Well, here you go.
Scoots::: Sorry about your friend, but that piece of driftwood over there looks pretty lonely.
Clyde:::  Driftwood Lincoln!
Clyde::: Eat my dust, Pizza Box Lincoln!
Pizza Box Lincoln:::  Eat my crust, Clyde! Ha-ha-ha!
Clyde::: Lincoln, come in! I finished my half of the list and a whole pizza.
Lincoln:::  Great. I finished my half, too. Let's rendezvous at the predetermined location.
Clyde::: Hey, here you go. I know what it's like to need a friend.
Pizza Box Lincoln::: Nice to meet ya!
Lincoln:::  What a day, huh, Clyde? So awesome.
Clyde:::  And rad.
Lincoln::: Except when we threw up.
Clyde::: And turned orange.
Lincoln::: And Lynn belched in my face.
Clyde::: And I fell in the lake.
Lincoln::: Let's not forget Petey.
Clyde:::  I think I'd rather forget.
Lincoln::: Come to think of it, today kinda...
Clyde::: Wasn't rad?
Lincoln::: Or awesome.
Clyde::: How did that happen?
Lincoln::: I guess we got so obsessed with finishing the list, we had no time to actually enjoy ourselves.
Clyde::: You're right. And now, spring break is over. We blew it.
Scoots::: Learn to drive, maniac!
Bus driver:::  Aw, this is the berries! I've got a blown tire.
Lincoln::: A blown tire? How are we gonna get home before the streetlights come on?
Clyde::: Look!
Scoots::: Hang on, boys! I'm about to get on the freeway!
Lincoln::: We're good here! Thanks for the lift!
Lincoln and Clyde::: YES!!!  We made it!
Lincoln::: All that stretching really paid off.
Clyde:::  Is it just me, or was getting home totally rad?
Lincoln:::  Yeah. The most awesome part of today wasn't even on the list.
Lincoln and Clyde::: Huh.
Clyde::: Guess we didn't blow our spring break after all.
Lincoln and Clyde::: Clincoln McLoud! 
Clyde::: So, what's our plan for summer break?
Lincoln and Clyde::: To not have one! 
Clyde::: Awesome!
Lincoln::: Rad!
Clyde::: Oh, my ride's here.  See you tomorrow, buddy.
Lincoln:::  Pretty bird?
Luan::: It's probably just another him and Clyde thing.
