Stanley:::  Once upon a time, thousands of years ago...
Stanley::: ...our ancestors lived in Clear Water Village. They farmed the land and enjoyed a peaceful life...
Stanley::: Until one day, the village was attacked...  By the infamous Han Family Bandits!
Stanley:::  'Hand over all your food or we will destroy your village!'
Adelaide:::  Oh, no! And then they destroyed it?
Sid::: Ssh! Dad's getting to that!  Dad, can you get to that?
Stanley::: As I was saying, our calm, wise...
Stanley::: And VERY handsome Ancestor Chang, who...  ...some say looks a lot like me, heh heh...
Adelaide::: Focus, Dad!
Stanley::: He realized that the Han family's hunger had driven them to a life of crime. So, he offered them a challenge...
Stanley::: ...if he gave them something more delicious...
Stanley::: ...than anything they'd ever tasted, they'd have to spare the village.  The bandits scoffed, but when Ancestor Chang gave them his goldfish bao...
Stanley::: ...it delighted their eyes, filled their stomachs, and energized their bodies! The bandits lost the challenge!
Stanley::: The Han family was so moved, that they gave up their evil ways and became the protectors of Clear Water Village!
Stanley::: And THAT'S the story of how THIS bao recipe saved the day.
Stanley::: It's been passed down through our family for generations.
The other Changs::: Ooh!
Stanley:::  And now, it's time for me to pass the recipe down to you two, so you can make bao for the Chinese Cultural Fair today.  My little buns, making their first buns...
Sid::: Aw, Dad...
Stanley::: Sid, too much filling. Adelaide, not enough filling. Each fin needs eight lines and eight is lucky, not seven, not nine, but eight.
Sid::: I don't think it matters how many--
Stanley:::  It matters. These baos saved our ancestor's village, so we have to make them  the right way. Especially because I need to outsell Mike Liu's zongzi stand.
Adelaide::: There. Finally. That looks amazing. 
Sid::: Oh, oh, oh! I did it too! 
Stanley::: Perfect! Good job, girls.
Sid and Adelaide:::  Yay!
Sid::: Hit it, Marcel! Oh yeah! We rock!
Adelaide::: Mastered it!
Stanley:::  Dance party later. I gotta go to the park and snag the best spot before Mike Liu gets there.  Oh, and I'm gonna need you to make eight hundred bao just like those two.
Sid::: It sounded like he said eight hundred.
Stanley:::  I did. Better get started. See you at the park. 
Adelaide::: But it took us forever to make two!
Sid:::  At this rate, we'll be Dad's age by the time we finish! There HAS to be a better way!
Sid::: That's it!
Adelaide::: Are you sure Dad will be okay with us taking a shortcut like this?
Sid::: Let's just not tell him. Hm...  Close enough. Let's speed it up.  Guys, you're falling behind!
Breakfast Bot:::  Warning, disaster imminent. Warning, warning, warning, warnign!
Sid::: Breakfast Bot, are you okay?
Breakfast Bot::: Define, 'okay'.
Sid::: On the plus side, the bao's done.
Hipster Male:::  One for the vloooog.  Man, you're costumes look really real.
Hipster Woman:::  And smell really real.  Eww.
Sid::: Dad's cultural association must've hired historical reenactors for the fair. They look just like the bandits from the story!
Hui::: Hand over all your food or we'll destroy your village.
Adelaide:::  Your acting's okay, but your moustache looks really fake.
Breakfast Bot::: Those are not reenactors. They are the bandits from the story.
Adelaide::: What do you mean, Breakfast Bot?
Breakfast Bot::: If my optical sensors are correct, we accidentally opened a rift in time and space when our bao making went awry. Look!
Adelaide::: Ooh, pretty.
Woo:::  Uh… This isn't Clear Water village.
Hui::: We've been lost before, but not this lost. Where are we?
Yi::: Who cares? I'm starving! Let's start raiding.
Sid & Adelaide:::  Uh-oh!
Breakfast Bot::: If my aural sensors are correct, it sounds like they were going to the village, but the rift brought them here before they got there.
Adelaide:::  And it sounds like they missed lunch.
Sid::: If we don't feed them, they'll destroy the city!
Yi::: Blegh! That's disgusting!
Vito::: Oh, bunch of tough guys, huh?  Is it over? Did I win?
Maybelle::: You ain't gettin' these mangos.
Sid::: I got it! Remember Dad's story? We just gotta give them the bao and they'll do whatever we want!
Adelaide::: Yeah! Just like Ancestor Chang!
Hipster Female::: Wow! You're really great method actors!
Sid:::  Stop!  If we give you something more delicious than anything you've ever tasted…
Adelaide::: ..Something that delights the eyes, fills the stomach and energizes the body...
Sid::: Will you stop doing bandity stuff and go back into the rift?  I present to you... the Changs' secret recipe bao!
Yi::: These bao stink!
Sid::: What? They can't be that bad.
Sid and Adelaide::: Hmm?
Adelaide:::  Ugh, I found some Nico hair. I guess we shouldn't have taken that shortcut. We have to remake them.
Sid:::  That'll take forever!  Wait! There's tons of yummy things here in the city.  Hey!  Waaaait!  I'm not done yet! I have more food to offer you!
Hui::: Fine, we'll give you three more chances, but if you fail, we're taking over this village.
Sid::: Sure. Let me show you the best eats of Great Lakes City.
Sid::: Alright, I don't know anyone who doesn't like pizza. Eat up!
Hui::: This delights the eye and fills the stomach but...
Yi::: It does not energize the body..
Sid::: Hotdogs are a Great Lakes City specialty.
Woo::: Fills the stomach.
Yi::: Energizes the body, but...
Han Family:::  Ugh. Does not delight the eye.
Adelaide::: Everyone loves ice cream sundaes.
Hui::: This is it! It delights the eye!
Woo:::  Fills the stomach.
Yi::: And energizes the bo--
Woo::: There's ice in my brain!
Hui::: Augh! It's attacking us!
Yi::: What is this cursed magic!?
Adelaide::: It's just brain freeze. Calm down.
Hui:::  Ah, a sneak attack!  You lost the challenge. Now we are taking over this village!
Sid::: Wait!  There's only one way to fix this.  We need to make the bao exactly like Ancestor Chang did in the story!
Adelaide::: You make the bao. I'll hold them off.
Sid::: How are you gonna do that?
Adelaide::: I'm a karate genius, duh. Now, go!
Sid:::  We'll be right back.
Breakfast Bot:::  Does she always have that on?
Adelaide::: Hey!  Let's dance.
Sid:::  Nope, no more shortcuts. I have to do this the right way.  This much filing...  Eight lines.  Pretty!  These will steam on the way there. Let's go!
Adelaide:::  Hi-ya!  Huh?
Yi:::  It's over, child.
Sid:::  Stooop!  You haven't had the perfect Chang family bao!
Hui:::  How are these different from the last ones?
Sid:::  Try them and see.
Yi:::  It delights the eye!
Hui:::  It fills the stomach.
Hoo::: And energizes the body!
Hui:::  Your village will be spared.
Breakfast Bot:::  Warning! Warning! The rift is about to close.
Sid::: Uh-oh. To the roof!
Woo:::  It's too bad we'll never have that delicious bao again, though.
Adelaide::: Oh, just go to Clear Water Village and ask for Ancestor Chang. They have the same bao.
Hui::: How do you know--
Adelaide:::  Just trust us!
Sid::: We did it! We did it!
Adelaide::: We're awesome! We did it!
Stanley::: Hey, girls. How's the bao coming along?
Sid:::  Oh, right.
Adelaide:::  We've got eight hundred to go!
Stanley:::  Girls? Hello?
Breakfast Bot:::  No one is available to take your call at this time. Please leave a message after the K-pop.
Stanley:::  Thank you for your help today, girls. We sold out, and beat Mike Liu's zongzi stand!  I know it's a lot of hard work, but I hope your first time making the family bao wasn't too boring.
Sid::: Oh, don't worry about that.
Adelaide::: Definitely not boring.
Yi::: Is that zongzi I smell? I'm starving!
