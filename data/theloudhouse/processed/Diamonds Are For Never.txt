Lincoln::: And now for my next trick, I shall make this ordinary bird disappear.
Lola:::  Gimme, gimme, gimme!
Lincoln::: For the rest of you, prepare to be amazed... Shazam!
Lynn:::  Boo! Give it up, Stinkin'. We know your hat has a false bottom and Walt's underneath it.
Lincoln:::  Uh, impossible. 'Tis magic.
Lynn:::  Let me see the hat, then.
Lincoln:::  Stop it!  Behold! I, Lincoln the Magnificent, have made the bird reappear.  A-thank you.
Lola:::  Hi, Mr. Grouse!  So, where'd you get that ring I saw you holding?
Mr. Grouse:::  Eh, what? You mean this one, Nosy Rosie? I found it in the ground with my trusty treasure detector.  Yeah. There's a precious stones and metal show coming to Royal Woods and I plan on selling whatever I find around town.  Ooh, I gonna be rolling in dough.
Lola:::  Dough?!  Well, being a money enthusiast myself, I think I can help you.  Hey!
Mr. Grouse::: Nyet! Bud Grouse works alone. Get your own tools.
Lola::: Where am I going to find a treasure detecting device?
Lola::: Lisa, I need your genius. It's an emergency.
Lisa:::  How can I help you? Time travel, atom-splitting, quantum physics?
Lola::: I need you to trick out my royal ride with treasure-finding capabilities. Pleeeeease?
Lisa:::  A bit pedestrian, but uh... sure.
Lola:::  Yay!
Lisa::: Lily, stay put 'til I get back. We're almost done with the transformation. Then you can attend first grade in my place.
Mr. Grouse:::  Hey, hey, hey, keep it down over there!
Mr. Grouse::: What in tarnation?!
Lola::: Hey there, Mr. G. Didn't see you there. Check out my new ride! A state-of-the-art treasure finding machine with highly sensitive treasure sensors.  Oh, don't waste your time searching the park. I beat you to it.
Mr. Grouse::: Why, you... 
Lola::: Oop, sounds like I got another hit! Excusez-moi.
Lola::: And before you even ask, Lola Loud works alone. Ta-ta!
Lola:::  Hey! What's going on here, Grouse?!
Mr. Grouse:::  Check it out. Two can play at this game, Loud.
Scoots:::  Don't even think about it, kid. Now scram!
Lola:::  Hey!  Ha!
Lola::: How are you this fast?!
Mr. Grouse::: You get pretty fast chasing people off your lawn!
Lola::: Get off my car!
Mr. Grouse::: Apparently, this town ain't big enough for the both of us.
Lola::: Well, I'm not stopping. I don't quit!
Mr. Grouse::: Then we gotta split up Royal Woods.  You don't cross into my territory and I don't cross into yours. Deal?
Lola:::  You got yourself a deal.
Lola::: Hmm. Looks like this is part of my territory.
Mr. Grouse::: Hmm. All clear. I'm on my side.
Flip::: Hey!
Lola:::  Bingo!
Mr. Grouse:::  Here it is!
Lola::: Move it, Gramps!
Mr. Grouse::: I don't think so, kid!
Mr. Grouse::: Nope! Well, clearly look at this! Right there! That's my side of the line!
Lola::: You wish! It's clearly on my side!
Mr. Grouse::: Look!
Flip::: Well, uh, actually chiefs, it's on both your sides.
Lola::: Ha! So it's half mine!
Mr. Grouse::: Uh, fine. We'll bring it to the precious stones and metal show tomorrow, and split the cash fifty-fifty. What do you say?
Lola::: I'm in. 
Mr. Grouse:::  Great, and I'll just hold on to the diamond in the meantime.
Lola::: Nuh-uh, no. I wasn't born yesterday. Why should you hold it?
Mr. Grouse::: Cause I'm more responsible. Plus, I don't trust you.
Lola::: Well, I don't trust you.
Flip::: Hey, why don't you guys compromise? Rotate watching it every hour, on the hour.
Mr. Grouse::: Oh, I like the sound of that.
Lola::: Works for me. Deal?
Mr. Grouse::: Deal!
Flip::: Hey, uh, now that Flip's helped you out, you gotta help Flip out. Who's gonna get my back?
Mr. Grouse::: Oh, nature calls.
Lola:::  He's leaving it unattended?  I knew he was irresponsible.
Lola::: Okay, here's my offer. You get me the diamond, I give you protection. If Lincoln tries any more magic on you, I'll make him disappear.
Mr. Grouse:::  The diamond!
Lincoln::: Hey Lynn, look. Now they're stinky...  Now they're not.
Mr. Grouse::: Ah-ha! Got you, Blondie.  Op. Got a nibble.
Lily::: Again, again!
Mr. Grouse:::  Now, not... not you, Lily.
Lola::: I know what it needs...
Lola:::  It's gone!  <big>GROOOOUSE!</big>  Where is it?!  Ew. Put it under an old football helmet? Now it's gonna smell like sweat and faded glory! Okay, this is not working. I don't trust you to watch the diamond, and you don't trust me.  BRB!  We'll watch it together!
Mr. Grouse::: That's fine by me. And just so there's no malarkey...  There! Now neither of us should be able to touch it until we take it to the show tomorrow.
Lola::: Wait, why do you get the key?
Mr. Grouse:::  Wait.  No worry. It won't be in there long. I eat a lot of fibre.
Lola::: Ew.
Mr. Grouse::: Hey, what are you doing, Sparkles?
Lola::: Where'd you stash it, Grouse?!
Mr. Grouse::: I didn't touch the dang thing!
Lola::: That sounds like something a diamond thief would say!
Mr. Grouse::: Hey! Keep your grubby little paws off my stuff! You're acting a lot like someone who stole a diamond and is trying to cover it up, meaning the stone is in your house!
Lynn Sr.::: Da-da-da... Ha! Grouse?!
Mr. Grouse:::  Is it in there?!
Lola::: Charles, go to town!  Where is that diamond?!
Mr. Grouse::: Where is that thing?!
Lincoln::: We're okay! Thanks for asking!
Lynn Sr.::: All right, what in the ding-
Rita:::  Lola?!  What has gotten into you, young lady?
Lisa::: Apparently, the same cognitive disturbance that's gotten into Mr. Grouse.
Mr. Grouse::: Well, that piece of work you call a daughter, stole my diamond!
Lola::: Our diamond! And I didn't steal it, he did!
Mr. Grouse::: Yeah, she did!
Lincoln::: Hold on a minute.
Lynn. Sr.:::  What's happening? Did something happen? I can't see anything!
Lincoln::: This is one of my magic boxes. It has a false bottom. The diamond must have fallen through.
Lola::: Does that mean it was in there the whole time?
Lincoln::: Yup.
Mr. Grouse:::  I'm sorry about this, little Loud. Maybe I should have placed more trust in you from the get-go.
Lola::: Yeah. I'm sorry, too.
Mr. Grouse:::  Hey...  We still got time to sell this puppy at the Gem Show. What do you say?
Lola::: I say we ride.
Mr. Grouse::: Oh, we're really rolling in it now. Nice doing business with you, kid.
Mr. Grouse:::  Huh? What now?
Lynn Sr.::: This should be enough to pay for the damages to my house.
Mr. Grouse:::  That's fair.
Lola::: Mr. Grouse, wait!  Here. This is for the damages to your house.
Mr. Grouse:::  Uh, gee, thanks, kid. Mighty sweet of ya. Hmm... you know, I don't think all the cash has to go toward repairs. We could keep a few bucks for ourselves.
Lola::: Really? But what should we do with it?
Mr. Grouse::: Ice cream?
Lola::: You got yourself a deal, partner.
Lola and Mr. Grouse::: You know, we make a really good team.
