Adelaide::: Okay, Ronnie Anne, I gave Froggy 2 his bacon bits.  But remember...
Ronnie Anne::: He'll wanna watch a movie and have his back massaged later.  On it.
Adelaide::: You're the best pet sitter ever.
Becca::: Thank you, Ronnie Anne, especially for pet sitting all of our extra animals this weekend, too.
Sid::: Yeah, mom was totally in a jam with the zoo's reptile house getting remodelled.
Ronnie Anne::: Happy to help.
Becca:::  And, Mrs. Casagrande, technically I know we shouldn't have any reptiles in the building, so I can't thank you enough for letting them stay.
Rosa::: Well I wouldn't normally bend the rules but I couldn't leave these cute animalitos without a home. Pero mira, it's just this once, and just this weekend, or we'll both be in big trouble with Mr. Scully. He's terrified of reptiles, especially snakes.
Becca:::  That must be your dad, girls.
Adelaide:::  I'll miss you so much, you be a good froggy for Ronnie Anne.  Bye-bye, Tortilla.  See you later, Iggy and Gus.  Bye, Cam.  Cam?
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, that's why his name is Cam, he can camouflage himself, I see why you need to use a bell.
Sid::: Actually it's short for Cameron, but that works, too.
Ronnie Anne::: Have a good trip and don't worry about Mr. Scully, he's never here.
Mr. Scully:::  Scully here.
Ronnie Anne::: What's he doing here? Quick, Abuela, hide the lizards.
Rosa::: Mr. Scully, we weren't expecting you.
Mr. Scully::: I'm here to install the new smoke detectors. Figure since the Changs' are away I'll start there.
Ronnie Anne::: Wait,  you can't install anything on an empty stomach, Abuela was just about to start cooking.
Rosa:::  You know me, always cooking.
Mr. Scully::: Are you feeling okay? You seem a little jumpy.
Ronnie Anne::: Abuela, that's enough salsa dancing.
Rosa:::  I always dance when I cook.
Mr. Scully::: Well, I never turn down a good meal, and after breakfast, we can start the installations.  Scully's getting breakfast.
Ronnie Anne::: Guys, I need your help, if Mr. Scully finds out that the Changs' are breaking the 'no reptile' rule...
Carl::: Your best friend's family will get the boot?
Ronnie Anne::: Exactly, so we need to hide the reptiles while Mr. Scully's installing the new smoke detectors.
Bobby:::  Nope, sorry, I am not a fan of tiny dinosaurs.
Ronnie Anne::: Guys, this is serious, Abuela could get in trouble, too
Bobby:::  Fine, I'll help, but I'm not touching them.
Carl::: Bobby! Don't move! The snakes on your back!
Bobby::: What? 
Carl:::  Chump.
Ronnie Anne::: Guys, focus, Scully will be here soon, so let's get these reptiles to the secret room. Sergio, you keep eyes on Scully, we need to know where he is at all times.
Sergio:::  Born to spy.
Mr. Scully::: That was delicious, Rosa.
Rosa:::  Oh, but you haven't had your, uh, breakfast dessert.
Mr. Scully::: Intriguing, but, I should get to the Changs'.  Actually, I think I'll start with the new room in the basement.
Ronnie Anne::: Change of plans.
CJ::: It's okay, I know a hiding place.
Ronnie Anne::: We can explain.
Sergio::: Mr. Scully's headed this way.  Don't kill the messenger.
Carl::: Come on, I know another spot.
Ronnie Anne::: Are you sure he won't mind?
Carl:::  Pssh, trust me, I've seen Abuelo nap through worse.
Hector:::  Rosa, ven, snuggle with me.
Sergio:::  Scully incoming. Go! Go! Go!
Hector:::  Come here, my squishy Rosa.
Bobby:::  Huh?
Carlota::: That was close.
Mr. Scully:::  See you later, Hector, sorry I woke you, you need me I'll be on the fourth floor
Carl::: He's done already?
Ronnie Anne::: Hide!
CJ::: Where?
Carl:::  We can send the reptiles on a little ride, but they'll need a chaperone.
Bobby:::  Oh! Why can't they be in cages?
Carl::: Because this is funnier.
Carl::: This is the only hiding place left!
Bobby::: But I don't like the spin cycle.
Sergio:::  Scully's done, he's headed home.
Ronnie Anne::: Yes! We're in the clear.
Carlota::: I can't believe our plan worked.
Carl::: Of course it did, we kicked butt.
CJ:::  Why is this cage empty?
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, that's Cam's cage, he's probably just camouflaging himself.
CJ:::  Nope, he's gone.
Bobby::: So you're telling me that a snake with the power to be invisible is loose in the building?! 
Ronnie Anne::: We need to warn Abuela about the missing sna-  Ah, hey, Mr. Scully.
Mr. Scully::: Hey kids, hope you don't mind, I invited myself to dinner. I couldn't resist Rosa's delicious chiles rellenos.
Ronnie Anne:::  Great news.
Carl:::  I love when she snakes those.  I mean makes those.
Ronnie Anne::: We have to find that snake before anyone else does. You guys stay here, have dinner, and cover for me. I'll find the snake.
Bobby::: But it could be anywhere.
Mr. Scully::: Was that Mr. Nakamura?
Ronnie Anne::: Oh yeah, it must be 'horror movie night'.
Mr. Scully::: Sounds like it was coming from the basement.
Ronnie Anne::: Yeah, he likes to watch down there, it's creepier, I'm gonna go check it out.
Mr. Nakamura::: Snakes?! Nelson, we're moving.
Ronnie Anne::: Nobody panic! I've got it under control.  Alright snake, you're coming with me.  Hey! Get back here!
Mr. Scully::: What was that?  And that?
Carlota::: Uh, that was...  ..Miranda... and she's practicing for a play where she finds out that her fiance is an alien.
Mr. Scully::: That would make me scream, too.
Ronnie Anne::: Dang it!
Mr. Scully::: Was that Miranda again? How many alien husbands does she have?
Carlota::: No, that was um... Mrs. Kernicky, practicing her... opera singing.
Georgia:::  Snake.
Ronnie Anne:::  Georgia! Don't move.
Mr. Scully::: Now that noise was too loud to ignore, someone could be in trouble.
Rosa::: Who wants more sides?
Mr. Scully::: I guess it can wait. Good thing I wore my stretchy pants.
Ronnie Anne:::  I’ve got you now, Cam  What’s with all the snake art Tía Frida?
Frida::: I’m working through my trauma!
Ronnie Anne::: Oh-no! ‘’’’ Hey.
Rosa::: Finally, come sit, Ronalda.
Ronnie Anne::: ‘’’’ Snake! Here!
Hector::: Ooh, are we playing charades? I know, you’re a rat, trying to get out of a burrito. Nailed it.
Mr. Scully::: Nah, that’s not it, Hector. Let's see, you're long, and you're wiggly, you’re spaghetti.  Oh, you're a…
Ronnie Anne::: No!
Mr. Scully:::  Snake!
Hector:::  I still think it’s a rat in a burrito.
Carlota:::  Oh-no! He's choking!
Rosa::: Pajarito! Pajarito!
Carl::: Abuela! That never works. 
Mr. Scully::: What is that thing doing here?
Ronnie Anne::: Mr. Scully, we can explain. The Changs' have nowhere else to put their reptiles.
Rosa::: It was only for the weekend, it won’t ever happen again. Nunca.
Ronnie Anne:::  Don't be mad.
Carlota:::  We're sorry.
Carl:::  I had nothing to do with this.
Mr. Scully::: I’m not thrilled that you allowed this Mrs. Casagrande, you broke the rules, your family broke the rules, the Changs’ broke the rules. You’re all out!  ..Is what I’d normally say, but that brave and noble snake saved my life.  Maybe I misjudged the scaly little guy, I mean that darn snake is a hero.
Ronnie Anne::: So does that mean?
Mr. Scully::: From here on out, I will allow reptiles in the building.
Bobby:::  I am done with reptiles for today.  Snake free in 2B.  Why’d it have to be snakes?
