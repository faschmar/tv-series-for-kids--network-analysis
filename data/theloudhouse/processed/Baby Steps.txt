Lincoln:::  AAAAHHH!
Clyde::: Slumberjack! Come in! It's Night Owl!
Clyde::: Slumberjack! Do you read me?
Lincoln::: Clyde?
Clyde::: Sorry about the late hour, but I have the best news ever!
Lincoln::: Lori found the book of poems you wrote about her and realized she's in love with you?
Clyde::: Okay, second best news ever. My dads are having another baby!  I'm gonna be a big brother!
Lincoln::: Clyde, that's amazing! Did they just tell you?
Clyde::: Well, not exactly. But I've been noticing clues for a while.
Clyde::: Baby clothes?
Clyde::: Baby bottles?
Clyde::: Come on, Cleopawtra.
Harold::: There. Can't be too safe with a little one on the loose.
Howard:::  That reminds me, we need to secure loose cables, and cover the outlets, and lock up the cleaning supplies.
Clyde::: So it was pretty clear what was going on. But I wasn't positive until about 5 minutes ago.
Harold::: Well, Howie, I think our home is ready. But what about our hearts? Do we really have room for another little bundle of joy?
Howard::: Of course we do, Harebear.  I cannot wait to surprise Clyde.
Clyde::: Being a big brother is the most important job I'll ever have. Apart from being Lori's soulmate. I need to make sure I'm ready for it!
Lincoln::: You woke up the right guy Clyde. I got the Big Brother thing down to a science. Why don't you spend a day shadowing me so you can learn firsthand?
Clyde::: Sweet! I'm on my way. 
Lincoln::: Love that enthusiasm, Night Owl, but it's 1:00 AM.
Clyde:::  Right. See you at 9:00, Slumber Jack.
Lincoln::: Sleep well, Night Owl.
Lincoln::: Okay, Clyde, allow me to introduce Lincoln Loud's 3 C's of Big Brothering: Confidence, caring, and when all else fails, cookies. 
Clyde:::  Snickerdoodles. My favorite.
Lincoln::: Ah ah ah. Those aren't for us. Now, time to start my rounds so you can observe the 3 C's in action. 
Lincoln::: Hear that?  First big brother cue of the day!
Lincoln::: First up, Confidence.  Don't worry, Lily. Your big brother's here to help. Let's get a look at that thumb of yours.  Just what I thought: a boo-boo. This calls for caring.
Lincoln::: Aw. I'm sorry you got such a bad ouchie. But we can make it better. 
Clyde::: Wow. You didn't even need a cookie.
Lily::: Cookie? 
Lincoln:::  Sometimes it's safer to spell.
Lola::: LANA!!! STOP IT!!!
Lana::: MAKE ME!!!
Lincoln::: Sounds like a twin fight. This should be very educational.
Lincoln::: Alright, Clyde, what do you think we need here?
Clyde:::  Um... confidence?
Lincoln::: What seems to be the problem?
Lola::: Lana's supposed to be guarding my Princess tower, not attacking it!
Lincoln::: Now, Lana-
Lana::: Aw, guarding is boring! Attacking is cool! 
Lincoln::: Clyde, any guesses?
Clyde::: Um... caring?
Lincoln:::  I think I know a compromise that will make you both happy.  The evil troll is attacking your tower! Rawr!
Twins:::  GET HIM!!!
Clyde::: Nice! And once again, you didn't need the C-O-O-K-I-E-S.
Twins::: THE TROLL'S GOT COOKIES!!! 
Lola::: I saw them!
Lincoln:::  Another tip: six-year-olds can spell.
Lola::: I need-
Lana::: -cookies!
Lisa::: Elder brother, I require your assistance.
Lincoln:::  What can I help you with, Lisa? Lab explosion? Nuclear crisis?
Lisa::: No. I have a hankering for a PB&J.
Lincoln::: Coming right up! 
Lisa:::  I can isolate uranium, but they won't let me use a butter knife. Also, I like the way Lincoln makes my sandwiches.
Lincoln:::  Here you go. Easy on the jelly, crusts cut off, and sliced into four right triangles for optimum mouth fit.
Lisa:::  Thank you. Technically, they're isosceles, but I'm not gonna bite the hand that feeds me.
Lincoln::: AAH! 
Lucy::: Hey, Lincoln, could you help me with a poem for school? I need a rhyme for tomb.
Lincoln:::  Hmm... Gloom? Doom? Powder room?
Lucy::: I knew I could depend on you.  Do I smell snickerdoodles?
Clyde::: It's a real pleasure to watch a master at work.
Lincoln::: Eh, I've had a lot of practice.
Lana::: GIVE IT!
Lisa::: NO, YOU GIVE IT!
Lincoln::: You ready to get some practice, too?
Clyde::: Heck, yes!  Okay, Clyde. Confidence.  Um, hey guys. Do you think you could just-  AGH! That was my foot!  What seems to be the problem here?
Lana::: You? Where's Lincoln?
Clyde::: I'm temporarily filling in for him and would be happy to help you settle your differences.
Lana::: Lisa stole my best rat, Bitey!
Lisa::: Who's Bitey? This is Subject 57A.
Clyde::: Uh, well, you both seem attached to it, and I want to be fair.
Lucy::: Hey, Clyde, I need advice. How do you know you've met your soulmate?
Clyde::: Oh. Uh, wow. That's some serious stuff. How much time do you have?
Lola::: LINCOLN!!!  CLYDE!!! Help me choreograph my ribbon dance!
Clyde::: Hold on a sec, Lucy.  Did Lincoln even go over ribbon dancing?
Lily:::  Boo-boo!
Clyde::: Just another minute, Lucy. Hang on, Lola.  Whoops!
Clyde::: No, no, no, no, no. Wait. It's all okay. Shh. Shh.
Clyde::: JUST TAKE THE COOKIES! 
Lincoln::: Clyde! What happened?
Clyde::: L-L-L-L-Lori? 
Lori::: Whatever. 
Lincoln::: Clyde! Talk to me, buddy. What happened back there?
Clyde:::  I failed at the 3 C's.
Lincoln::: What? How is that possible? You're the most caring person I know. And you make great cookies.
Clyde::: It's the confidence I'm struggling with.  What if I give bad crush advice, and my future sibling gets their heart broken? Or what if I can't choreograph a ribbon dance, and they drop out of school and start holding up convenience stores? I'm going to be a terrible big brother!
Lincoln:::  CLYDE!  You're spiraling! You can do this. Just get out there and try again.
Clyde::: I can't, Lincoln! I don't have the confidence you do. And I never will.
Lincoln:::  It's okay, buddy. How about we just forget the whole training thing and play some video games?
Clyde::: That sounds great.
Lincoln::: I'll just go grab us some snacks. 
Lisa::: Lincoln?
Clyde:::  AAH! SISTER!  I mean, hi, Lisa.
Lisa::: I require assistance securing my shoestrings.
Clyde::: Aren't you a certified genius?
Lisa::: Yes. Which is why there is no room in my brain for such trivialities.
Lisa::: Thanks, Clyde. You're a lifesaver. 
Lucy::: Where's Lincoln?
Clyde::: YAH! I mean, you might wanna try the kitchen.
Lucy::: That's a long walk. I need a rhyme for... Lori.
Clyde::: Really? Well, I've got about a hundred! Story, glory, Montessori...  ... and inventory. Now, those are just the ones in English.
Lucy::: Thanks, Clyde. You're a lifesaver.
Lola::: Where's Lincoln? I need him to show me how to buckle my seat belt.
Clyde::: Oh. Well, that's simple enough. Why don't I show you? Just insert the metal fitting into the buckle and pull tightly across your waist. To release, simply press the center button.
Lola:::  Oh. I never could have figured that out.  You're a lifesaver, Clydey. 
Clyde::: You... you want me to read to you?
Clyde::: ...and Z is for Zucchini. The end.  Hey, Lincoln! Guess what? I think I have the missing C now!  Lincoln?
Lola::: Okay, I did the damsel in distress act. Now where's my 5 bucks?
Lucy::: Yeah, pay up.
Lisa::: I should be doubly compensated for having to act like such an ignoramus.
Clyde:::  YOU STAGED THAT WHOLE THING?!
Lincoln::: Clyde! I can explain! I was just trying to boost your confidence!
Clyde::: I think I should go. 
Lincoln::: Clyde, wait!
Lana:::  CLYDE! HELP! I CAN'T GET DOWN!
Clyde:::  You can save the act, Lana. I know Lincoln's paying you to do this.
Lana::: What are you talking about? Bitey and I are really stuck, and I think he's afraid of heights.
Lana::: And... maybe I am, too. 
Clyde::: It's okay, Lana. Don't be scared. I'll rescue you!
Clyde::: You guys doing okay?
Clyde::: I know what it's like. One time, I got stuck on a diving board. And a step stool.
Lana::: YAY!
Clyde:::  Here. You earned it.
Lana::: I don't know what I would have done without you, Clyde.  Oh, you're a real life saver! 
Lincoln:::  Clyde! I thought you left. Look, I owe you an apology.
Clyde::: It's okay, Lincoln. I finally got my confidence. For real this time. I gotta go tell my dads I'm ready to be a big brother! 
Lincoln:::  Good luck, buddy. You're gonna do great.
Lola::: Lisa, move your big butt!
Lisa::: Move your own oversized posterior!
Lincoln:::  Ah, a big brother's work is never done.
Harold::: Clyde, honey, we have something to tell you.
Clyde:::  I already know what it is! We're having a baby, and I'm gonna be a big brother! And it's gonna be great, 'cause Lincoln taught me the three C's, and I can't wait to start baking cookies, and-
Harold::: Clyde, you're spiraling.
Howard::: And did you say baby?
Clyde::: Yeah. I saw the bottles, and the clothes, and I heard you guys talking.
Harold::: I'm afraid there's been a bit of a mix-up. Your dad and I haven't been preparing for a baby.
Howard::: We've been preparing for...  ... A KITTEN!!! Meet Cleopawtra's sister, Nepurrtiti. We finally got to bring her home from the shelter today.
Clyde::: Wow. She's perfect. And just so you guys know, if you ever do decide to have another human child, I'm totally ready for it.
Howard::: We'll be back in an hour. You okay keeping an eye on the kitties?
Clyde:::  I've got the three C's: Caring, Confidence, and Cat treats.
Clyde::: Whoops. Guess I should have spelled that.
