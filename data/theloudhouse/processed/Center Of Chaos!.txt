Lori::: Morning, Walt.  Okay, guys! Up and at 'em! I want everyone by the front door and ready for school in 20 minutes, or you are walking!
Lucy::: Ohm. The spirits are telling me that this morning will end with a rude awakening.
Lynn:::  We already got a rude awakening, and her name is Lori!  Heads up!  Goooooal!
Lori::: 15 minutes, guys!
Luna:::  Alright, dudes! Dig these getting ready for school jams! 
Luan::: I'm hungry. I wish you had some toast to go with those jams.  Get it? Oh. I guess I should continue getting bready for school! 
Lisa::: Lana, might you have a small specimen of scatological material from our domesticated canis familiaris I could borrow?
Lana::: Some what from the who now?
Lisa::: Do you have any of Charles' dog poop?
Lana::: Oh, sure. Were you thinking fresh or day old?
Lincoln::: Lola! Did you give my action figure a makeover?! 
Lola::: Heck yes I did!
Lincoln::: But it was M.I.B.: Mint In Box!
Lola::: Yeah, now it's F.O.B.: Fabulous Outside Box. Your Welcome. Ew.
Lily::: Poo-poo poo. Pe-pe.
Lincoln::: Aah! Full diaper! Retreat, retreat!
Lori::: Not so fast, Lincoln. It's your turn to change her. 10 minutes, people!
Lincoln::: What? Why is it always my turn after Lily eats strained cabbage and beets?  Save yourself, buddy!  Stop running, Lily! You're getting it everywhere.
Leni:::  Come on, Lori! Some of us need to use the bathroom too!
Lori:::  Hold your horses. 
Luan::: Hold your horses?  Come on, Lori! You're not the only gallop in here who needs to use the bathroom! We're all gelding tired of waiting! I hope you won't be in there furlong, you're way pasture time limit! I don't want to stirrup any trouble, but my mane point is if you take any longer, we might have to hoof it to school!  Man, I'm on fire!  I guess when it reigns, it pours!
Leni:::  Lori!
Lori::: I said wait! I'm trying to make my eyebrows even!
Leni::: Oh, sorry. I didn't realize it was something so serious! Take all the time you need. 
Lisa::: Thank you, sibling! I shall repay you with interest.
Lana::: That's okay. This one's on the house. Actually it was on the floor.
Lynn::: Lucy! Call off your vampire bat before I show it my baseball bat!
Lucy::: Hold still. Fangs just needs a little breakfast.  Whoa Fangs, don't drink it all.
Lincoln::: Okay. Lily's diaper is changed, whose turn is it to get her dressed?
Lana & Lola::: It's our turn. She's gonna be a...  
Lisa::: Siblings! Scatter!!
Lisa::: Aah!  Well, that wasn't so bad.  Aah! I spoke too soon!  Tell my story!!
Lori::: Stop messing around, guys. Five minutes!
Lana::: Has anyone seen my lizard?  Rebecca?! Rebecca?!
Leni:::  Get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off!!
Lana::: There you are, Becky! C'mon, girl! C'mon!
Leni:::  That was the most frightening experience of my life.
Luan::: Oh, really? How would you rate it on a scale of one to ten?  Get it?
Lori:::  Forget the lizard. You've got a code magenta.
Leni::: What?! An ear zit?!  My life is over!
Luna:::  Good night, Loud House! Oh, wait, it's morning. 
Lori::: Okay everyone, time to go!
Leni:::  Whaaaaat?
Luan::: Not to beat a dead horse, but I really did wrangle up some good ones there!
Rita:::  Kids, why are you all up so early on a Saturday?
Loud Kids:::  Saturday?!
Lynn:::  Thanks, Lori. 
Lori::: Don't blame me! Walt woke me up!
Lola::: Ugh. Blame the bird.
Leni::: Ugggh! Lori, C'mon! You take forever!
Lucy:::  I told you the morning would end with a rude awakening.
Lucy::: The spirits never lie.
