Lincoln::: Ugh, no more pasta.  I can't eat another bite.
Lana::: Me neither. Wait.  Made room for one more bite. 
Lucy::: I could nap for all eternity. 
Lynn Sr.::: Okay! Who wants more parmesan?
Everyone::: I do! Why not?
Luna::: Why you pushin' the parm on us, Pops?
Lynn Sr.::: My chef pen pal, Furio, sent it to me from Italy!  Oh, this stuff is incredible.  But he sent me way too much of it! And he also sent me this.  It's a priceless work of art, huh?  No one eat it.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh! It just. Keeps. Coming.  Lynn's Table is having a Cheese Week, everyone! Parmesan for all!
Scoots::: This is oatmeal, ding dong.
Lily::: Haha, yay! 
Rita:::  Lily! No climbing on the parmesan!  Lily! That is very disrespectful!
Lynn Sr.::: We taught you not to be rude!  Okay, which one of you taught her to be rude?
Children::: I don't know. It wasn't me.
Lily:::  A-B-C-D-E-F...G.
Lynn::: Okay, okay, That one was me.  And you nailed it!
Rita::: Who's in here?
Lynn Sr.:::  It's the middle of the ding-dang night!
Rita::: Lily! How did you get out of your crib?!
Lily:::  Snack!
Lynn Sr.::: No, no, it's not snack time, sweetie.  It's time to--
Lily:::  Snack! Now! 
Rita::: What is going on with her?! She's supposed to be the sweet one!
Lana:::  We heard that! 
Lucy:::  Not cool, Mom.
Lynn:::  Aw, come on!
Rita:::  Sorry, kids.  Love you.
Lily::: No, no, no, no, no! No, no. Wait!  Snack! Now!
Rita:::  No, Lily. You clearly need sleep. And you have school in the morning!
Lynn Sr.::: Wait a minute. School! Maybe that's where she's picking up this bad behavior!
Rita:::  That makes total sense! Maybe she's got a new friend who acts like this.
Lisa:::  Finally some peace and quiet.  Hmm. Fascinating.
Lily::: Snack, snack!
Lynn Sr.::: Okay, first thing tomorrow morning, we march right in there and find out who's ruining our precious Lily.
Lily:::  Snack, snack, snack, snack, snack.
Rita::: That won't work--whoa!  If she sees us there, she'll know something's up.  We'll need to get creative! 
Lynn Sr.::: Whoa! Nice save, hon! 
Rita::: You ready for a fun day at preschool?
Leni::: So ready!  Did I tell you they have a trampoline? 
Rita::: Yes, sweetie. Forty-three times.  But remember, the reason you're going is to keep an eye on Lily. You need to find out who's encouraging her to misbehave.
Leni::: I'm on it, Mom!
Lynn Sr.:::  Don't forget your lunch, Leni!  LJ! I got more parmesan for ya!
Dr. Shuttleworth::: Great job, class! I'm so proud of all your arts and crafts!
Leni::: Dr. S, look!  I made a painting based on this scary dream I had last night. There were some super cute espadrilles on sale, and they didn't have my size! But I bought them anyway--
Dr. Shuttleworth::: Lily, Audrey! What did you do?!
Leni::: Looks like we know who the bad kid is.  'Audrey...bad.' Case closed. Leni, I think you've earned yourself a break.
Dr. Shuttleworth:::  Lily! Jackson! Put down those juice boxes!
Leni::: Jackson's bad too?
Leni::: Ugh, one bedroom is not enough space for all these dollies!
Dr. Shuttleworth::: Lily! Ellis!  This is not how we use tape!
Leni::: Ellis is bad too?! I can't believe it! 
Rita::: This is worse than we thought! Audrey, Jackson, Ellis, Flynn, Max, Tilly--cute name-- Joey, Monti, Solley.
Lynn Sr.::: Every kid in that class is a bad influence! 
Rita:::  Lily, stop throwing pans!  Let's get outta here! 
Lynn Sr.::: We're gonna have to start wearing helmets!  What if she stuck like this forever?
Older Lynn Sr.::: Please, Lily! I'm sick of this helmet! I haven't seen my hair in fifteen years!  My hair! My hair!
Lynn Sr.::: My hair! My hair!
Rita:::  Honey, you're spiraling. We still have time to save her. Lily just needs to spend time with other kids. Nicer kids!
Lynn Sr.::: You mean like our kids?
Rita::: Of course not!
Lana:::  We can hear you, Mother! 
Luna::: Seriously, dude?!
Rita::: I mean toddlers, Lynn. Royal Woods has plenty of great kids. I'm sure it'll be a breeze to find a good friend for Lily.
Lynn Sr.::: Parmesan Lynn! Nooo!
Lynn Sr.:::  Rita, I've got eyes on a mother and a child in the cereal aisle. The kid's dressed impeccably with no signs of drool.  Rita? Rita, what's your location?
Rita::: 10-4. I'm by the melons!  Nope, Lily is not hanging out with a biter.
Scoots::: Huh. This one's mushy! Discount for Scootsy!  This melon has a face! 
Rita::: We should go. You would tell me if I was mushy, right, Lynn?
Lynn Sr.:::  Mm-hmm.
Rita::: Okay, this one has potential. Look how mellow she is. I think she's meditating. 
Lynn Sr.::: Ooh, that is not meditation. But, hey, she's still in diapers. I mean, that's just a normal--  Oh, my gosh, she's throwing it!
Rita::: Let's get out of here! 
Rita::: Boy, that kid had an arm.
Aidan::: Oh, how lovely. Thank you, Mother and Father, for this delicious fast food meal.
Rita::: Ooh, well, what do we have here? Calm. Behaved. No diaper bombs.
Lynn Sr. and Rita::: He's perfect!
Lynn Sr.::: Let's go talk to his parents. I'll grab some parm from Vanzilla. It'll be an icebreaker!
Rita::: Hi, Lily.  We have a special playdate for you.
Aidan::: Hello, Miss Lily. My name is Aidan. 
Lynn Sr.::: And I made your favorite: Parmesan sandwiches! That'll be all, Cliff.  He's been helping in the kitchen.
Rita::: Aidan is a very good boy, so, you know, just do whatever he does. 
Aidan::: Milady, do you want to play alphabet blocks?
Rita::: Hear that?
Lynn Sr.::: All I hear is quiet, peaceful play. Ha! It's so wonderful!  Ah, there. That oughta stick.
Rita::: I guess all Lily needed was another great kid to bring out her great kid-ness.
Lynn Sr.:::  And we are great parents for figuring this out!  Ah, Lily's gonna be just fine.
Older Lynn Sr.::: Kids! Lily's home! And she won the Nobel Prize for good behavior! Five years in a row!  And you bought me new pans with your prize money?!  Oh, you're the best daughter ever!
Lynn Sr.::: To us! And my new cast iron pans! 
Rita::: Lily! What happened?!
Todd::: FEELING DIZZY. SO... COLD. 
Aidan::: Miss Lily is a very bad girl.
Lily::: I having funnnnn!!!! 
Rita::: We're so sorry!
Lynn Sr.::: Enjoy the apology parm! Annnd they're rolling it back.  And it's picking up speed! 
Rita::: It's not the other kids. We have the bad kid! 
Lynn Sr.::: Ugh! I can't believe Lily was the problem this whole time!  Rita, I'm so scared.
Older Lynn Sr.::: No! No, no, no, no, no!
Older Rita::: Stop! Stop! Stop!
Older Lynn Sr.::: We should've seen this coming.
Lily::: Miiiine!
Luan::: Lily! There's plenty of cheese for all of us! Be a Gouda girl! You're acting like a muenster!
Lynn Sr.::: What has gotten into you, Lily?!
Rita::: Lynn! I know why she's acting like this! It's the cheese! Too much cheese can really, you know,  back up the plumbing.
Lynn Sr.::: Ah! Of course! And when that happens, you get, you know, cranky.  I know what we have to do.  These triple-bran, fiber blast muffins ought to do the trick.
Rita::: Ugh!
Lynn Sr.::: I added chocolate chips. I'm not a monster. 
Rita::: Feeling better, sweetie?
Lily:::  Much better! 
Rita::: I'm so glad we have our Lily back.
Lynn Sr.::: And I'm glad I convinced Flip to take all that ding dang cheese. I sure hope parmesan Flippees are a hit.  Ugh! They won't be.
Lily:::  Look! I made a horsey!
Leni:::  Ugh, thanks a lot, Lily. I was gonna paint a horsey, but you totally stole my idea! 
Rita:::  Oh, no. I think someone else might be... backed up.
Lynn Sr.:::  I'll start baking more muffins!
