Ronnie Anne:::  Whoo-hoo! Yes!  Whoo-hoo! I'm so excited for movie night! Who's turn is it to host anyway?
Sid::: I can check.
Laird:::  Oh, don't be me. Don't be me.
Sid::: Looks like Laird's up.
Laird::: Phew!  Oh, wait, I'm Laird!
Bruno::: My cart!
Ronnie Anne::: Laird!
Bruno::: Are you okay?
Laird:::  Yeah.
Bruno:::  Not you.  I'm talking to my baby! He was only two days away from retirement.
Laird::: Um, I don't think I can host tonight. I don't feel so good.
Nikki::: Bro, you already used that one.
Sameer::: Yeah. You always have an excuse!
Casey::: You're not getting out of it this time!
Ronnie Anne::: Come on, Laird, it'll be fun!
Sid, Nikki, Sameer, Casey, and Ronnie Anne::: Laird! Laird! Laird!
Ronnie Anne::: Laird, are you okay?
Laird::: No. I don't wanna host a movie night because...  I'm embarrassed by where I live.  It's a money thing.
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way, Laird. But money doesn't matter to us.
Laird::: It matters to me, Ronnie Anne. My house doesn't look like everyone else's.
Ronnie Anne::: We'll figure this out.  Oh, one sec.  Hey, Dad. How's vacation?
Arturo::: Amazing, Ronita. I'm swimming with dolphins!  That means... Que pasa, delfin. Anyway, I'm calling to see if you could please grab my mail when you go to water my plants.
Ronnie Anne::: You got it.
Arturo::: Gracias, Ronita.  Hey, hey, hey! Give that back! It's not waterproof!
Laird::: Wait, your dad's on vacation? Maybe we can have movie night at his place and pretend it's my place!
Ronnie Anne::: Um, what? I don't know.
Laird::: Well, it's just a few hours, and I'll make sure no one makes a mess.  Please?
Ronnie Anne::: I think you kneeled in some relish.
Bruno::: I know relish, and that ain't relish.
Laird::: Thank you so much Ronnie Anne. This is perfect.
Ronnie Anne::: Hmm... Not yet, we still have to make this place look like it's yours. Did you bring the stuff?
Laird::: You bet.  Ready to Laird-ify.
Laird:::  They're here! Are you sure we lairdified enough?
Ronnie Anne::: I think we're good, just be cool.
Laird::: Welcome to the Laird lair, where I live. My parents are gone for the night so the place is all ours. Huh. Did I mention I live here? 
Nikki::: Bro, this place rocks.
Casey::: Yeah, you've been holding out on us, give us the grand tour.
Sameer::: Let's start with the bathroom. Cause I gotta go before the movie.
Laird:::  Uh… Uh, sure. Uh… The bathroom is right here.
Ronnie Anne::: I think he meant that the bathroom is right there through that door over there.
Nikki::: What are these?
Laird::: Oh, that's, uh, hockey gear. Designed to intimidate your opponents.
Nikki::: Oh, awesome. Let's play.
Ronnie Anne::: Laird, that's my dad's art from Peru, it's really expensive.
Laird::: Oh, I got this.  Uh, guys, why don't we go to the kitchen and uh…
Nikki::: Nice catch, Ronnie Anne.
Laird::: Ah, yeah nice catch.  So here's the kitchen. Definitely my kitchen.
Sid:::  Laird, you have the Juice-o-matic 5000? It blends, purees and even deseeds. Please make me a smoothie.
Laird:::  Sure Sid, that's something I know how to use.
Juice-o-Matic 5000::: Your juice is ready.
Sid::: Now that's the good stuff, thanks Laird.
Laird::: Oh don't mention it.
Sameer::: Hey why is there a big box of chocolates with a note that says… for Ronnie Anne?
Laird:::  What!? Oh that's nothing.
Nikki:::  Wait a second this can only mean one thing…  Laird has a big, fat crush on Ronnie Anne!
Laird:::  Yes! that's it, you caught me old Romeo here. Obsessed with this beautiful creature.  I am so so sorry.
Ronnie Anne::: Okay let's just start the movie.
Casey::: Is it a romance?
Casey::: Alright people, you know the rules. No texting during the movie.
Ronnie Anne::: Oh wait! that's a drawer that always gets stuck.  Or so Laird tells me.
Casey::: Eh, we can deal with it later, it's movie time. Someone snack me.  Ooh, fuego flavour.
Sameer::: Sit next to Laird, Ronnie Anne.
Everyone::: Ooh.
Nikki::: Laird killer movie night now let's watch... Evil Hatman: The Brimming.
Laird::: I owe you big time Ronnie Anne.
Ronnie Anne's Voicemail::: Hey this is Ronnie Anne. Beep. 
Arturo::: Ronita, I had to cut my trip short. Apparently…  means, ‘attack me'.  All I want to do is relax in my bed.  Great, I lost my keys in the ocean.
Actor in Scary Movie::: Hey, who put that hat there?
Ronnie Anne::: Don't put it on.
Actor in Scary Movie::: I think I'll put it on.
Ronnie Anne::: What was that?
Sid::: It was the door.
Sameer:::  But… but, who could it be at this hour?
Nikki::: Someone should go check it out.
Casey:::  You're right.  Thank you for volunteering, Nikki.
Nikki:::  It's Hatman!
Casey::: Should we call for help?
Laird::: Oh, uh, let's not be too hasty. Could be a mistake.
Nikki::: He's gone.
Laird::: What did I tell you? Now let's get back to movie night.
Sameer::: He's coming through the window.
Ronnie Anne::: Not if I can help it!  Fly cactus!  Quick! We gotta lock that window.
Nikki::: I got this. If something happens to me Sid gets my skateboard.
Sid::: Yes!
Sameer::: Oh man.
Arturo:::  Burglars! Must be after my Juice-o-matic 5000.  Hello? Police? A band of thieves are trying to steal my juicer!  Of course that's an emergency.  Hello? Hello? 
Ronnie Anne::: That's it! I'm getting our phones and calling for help. If something happens to me Sid gets my skateboard.
Sid::: Yes!
Sameer & Casey::: What does she need two skateboards for?
Casey::: Are you jiggling it right?
Ronnie Anne::: You see me jiggling.
Nikki::: Ask Laird, it's his house.
Laird::: I mean, a jiggles a jiggle.
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, we can't get our phones, but everyone stay calm. All the windows and doors are closed, right?
Sameer:::  Well, I may have cracked open the bathroom window.  I was being considerate.
Laird::: This is bad! This is so bad!
Sid::: Pull yourself together, Laird!
Casey::: Ronnie Anne, what should we do?
Ronnie Anne::: Hmm, guys we need to defend my dad- I mean Laird's home.
Arturo::: No no no, you don't understand officer. It's the Juice-o-matic 5000. You know why they call it that? That's how much it cost.  Hello?
Sameer::: Hey Hatman! Eat romantic chocolates!
Nikki::: Eat pineapple, Hatman!
Arturo::: Spiky!
Sid::: Booyah! Nobody breaks into Laird's house and gets away with it.
Ronnie Anne::: We got you now Hatman no more sequels for you.
Arturo:::  Ronita?
Casey, Sameer, Nikki & Sid::: Ronnie Anne's dad?
Laird:::  Oh boy.
Arturo::: What are you all doing in my apartment?  Is this my apartment? Oh, that dolphin must have hit me hard.
Ronnie Anne::: I'm so sorry, Dad; this is all my fault.
Laird::: No, it's my fault. This is his place. I wanted you all to think it was mine; Ronnie Anne was just helping me.
Nikki::: Why'd you do it, Laird?
Casey::: More importantly, does this mean you're not in love with Ronnie Anne?
Laird::: I was just worried you'd see my house and treat me differently.
Sid::: Aw, Laird, it doesn't matter where you live.
Nikki::: We'll always be your friends, bro.
Laird:::  Thanks guys. I'm sorry Ronnie Anne's Dad, I hope I didn't bruise your pineapple.
Arturo::: I'm just glad my juicer is safe. You can still have movie night here if you want.
Laird::: No Ronnie Anne's Dad. We can have it at my house. My real house, I'm tired of living a lie. And you can come too Ronnie Anne's Dad.
Arturo::: Only if you stop calling me that.
Ronnie Anne::: Movie night is saved!
All kids::: Laird! Laird! Laird!
Ronnie Anne::: Laird, you were embarrassed because you live here?
Laird::: Not anymore. Who wants snacks? We have free vending machines in every room.
Arturo:::  Can I pretend this is my house?
