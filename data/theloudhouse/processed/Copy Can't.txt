Carl::: If he makes the field goal, Carl Casagrande will go down as the most daring, most talented, most handsome,
CJ:::  Any day now Carl.
Carl::: Football player in history!
Hector, CJ, & Carl::: Goal!
Rosa:::  My chilaquiles are for eating.
Ronnie Anne:::  So, did you get all the supplies for our big go cart race?
Sid::: Yup, and I got us matching helmets too.  I wasn't sure what size your head is, so I got some options.
Rosa::: No telefonos at breakfast, mija.
Sergio::: Busted.  Coming through.
Maria:::  ¡Oy! ¡Fuego!
Frida::: Awe, what a cute copy cat. 
Carlota::: Carlitos, look at this.
Ronnie Anne::: Carlitos, copy this.  I'm a walrus. See?  Don't you wanna copy me too Carlitos?
Carl:::  Denied!
Frida:::  Carl.
Ronnie Anne::: No, he's right, Carlitos copies everyone but me. Do you think it's because he doesn't like me?
Frida::: Oh, of course not, Carlitos is just a baby, and babies are finicky sometimes.
Carlos::: He'll warm up to you, you just need to give him time. The average infant needs around six months before-
Ronnie Anne::: Thanks Tío, but, I'd rather just get Carlitos to like me now.
Frida::: Ronnie Anne, you should try taking him to the park.
Ronnie Anne::: That's a great idea Tía Frida.  Come on Carlitos, let's get some fresh air.
Maria::: Sorry, too much hot sauce.
Ronnie Anne::: Get ready Carlitos, I'm about to blow, your, mind.  What do you think?  Is your mind blown yet?  Carlitos?
Sid::: Hey Ronnie Anne, I added flames to our helmets. Hardcore right?
Ronnie Anne::: Thanks Sid. But can we do this later? I'm trying to get Carlitos to like me.  I thought my cool skateboard tricks would win him over, but I'm not getting anywhere.
Sid::: Hmm, have you tried doing things that babies think are cool?  Observe.  Now you try.  Ouch, that's harsh. Well, I'm sure you'll get there. Now I'm gonna go add feathers to our helmets, nothing says hardcore like feathers. 
Ronnie Anne:::  Ooh, I know, no one can resist a compliment.  Who's the most handsome baby around? You are.  Ah!
Carlota::: ¿Que haces Ronnie Anne?
Ronnie Anne::: I'm trying to win Carlitos over with compliments.  Excellent digging technique, bet you have some nice mocos in there.
Carlota::: No, no, Ronnie Anne, you are way too desperate for his attention. If you want someone to like you, the key is to act un interested. Take Diego for example.  I've been ignoring him for the past forty-five minutes.
Ronnie Anne::: Alright, I'll try it.  Is it working? Does he like me now?
Carlota::: Just wait, he'll come around, they always do.  Okay, it's not working.  Grab him. Grab him!
Carl::: Hey Ronnie Anne. So, Carlitos still doesn't like you, huh?
Ronnie Anne::: No, no, no, we're doing great.
Carl::: Listen, the key to any good family relationship is bribery, watch and learn.  Hey Sergio, who's your favorite Casagrande?
Sergio:::  Me, no contest  Carl's a close second.  Carl for the win.
Carl:::  Works every time.
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, let me try.  Carlitos, want some chicharrones from your favorite prima Ronnie Anne?
Carl::: Wow, that's cold.
Ronnie Anne:::  Fine! I guess you'll just never like me.  Ow.
Carlitos::: Ow.
Ronnie Anne:::  YES! HE COPIED ME! HE LIKES ME!  Oh yeah, Oh!
Ronnie Anne::: Guys, Carlitos finally mimicked me.  Guess he likes me after all.  Isn't that right little dude?
Carlitos:::  Ow.
Rosa::: ¿Que he?
Frida::: Ow?
Ronnie Anne::: He thinks my name is Ow, but it still counts. He likes me.  Time for a victory snack.
Carlitos::: Time for victory snack!
Frida::: Time for your bottle Cariño.
Carlitos:::  Ow.
Frida:::  Seems like this little copy cat idolizes his prima now, he wants you to feed him. 
Ronnie Anne::: Really? Me? Nice. 
Carlos::: Oh, when Carlitos is done with his bottle, I can give him a bath.
Carlitos::: Ow! Wa wa Ow!
Carlos::: Well, maybe you should do it, he doesn't seem to want to let go of you.
Carlos::: Sorry, he was asking for Ow.
Frida::: Uh, he really, really, likes his prima, it's almost like he's forgotten all about his mama. 
Sid::: Hey buddy, if you thought our helmets were cool before, just wait.  We're really gonna wow everyone at the big race today.  Ronnie Anne, did you get a new cat recently?
Ronnie Anne::: Sid wait, don't open the-
Carlitos:::  Hi Ow.
Sid:::  Woah, when's the last time you slept?
Ronnie Anne::: It's been days, my plan to make Carlitos like me worked too well, he won't even go to Tía Frida or Tío Carlos anymore. Sorry, but I can't drive the go-cart with you today Sid, there's no way that Carlitos will let me out of his sight.
Sid::: Awe, that's okay, too bad we don't have a Ronnie Anne clone.
Ronnie Anne:::  Hey, that gives me an idea. Sid, I'm gonna need your help.
Sid::: There, that'll care of the facial hair problem.  And now for the belly hair problem. 
Bobby::: Wait, what?  I used to have an innie. 
Ronnie Anne::: Carlitos look, a three eyed camel.
Bobby:::  Sorry, I must have imagined it.
Carlitos::: Ow.
Ronnie Anne::: Let's do this, wait, our horns. 
Bobby:::  Where is Carlitos?
News Correspondent::: I'm here at the Great Lakes City annual go-cart race, with two of it's youngest competitors; Sid Chang and Ronnie Anne Santiago. Girls, what's your favorite part of racing?
Ronnie Anne::: Competing with my best friend.
Sid:::  Winning at all costs.  Sorry, it's the helmet talking.
Carlitos::: Ow?
Bobby:::  No, no, no, I'm Ronnie Anne. Really.  No, not the duct tape.
Carlitos::: Ow.
Bobby::: Wait, okay come back. 
Race Track Announcer::: Racers, on your marks, get set, go!
Ronnie Anne::: Look at us, we're winning.
Carlitos:::  Ow! Ow!
Ronnie Anne::: Did you hear something?
Carlitos::: Hi, Ow, Ow.
Ronnie Anne::: Carlitos? How did you get here?
Bobby:::  Sorry, that was my bad. 
Ronnie Anne::: Sid, take the wheel. Carlitos, it's dangerous out here, take my hand.
Carlitos:::  Ow.
Ronnie Anne::: I can't reach him. Sid, get me closer.  Gotcha.
Sid::: Guess that's what happens when you spend all your time on helmets.  That was for if we won. 
Frida:::  Remember, when he needed me?
Ronnie Anne:::  Tío Carlos, Tía Frida, I should have listened to you guys and waited for Carlitos to warm up to me instead of forcing it.  I'm so happy Carlitos likes me now, but I got way more than I bargained for, I'll probably have to take him to college with me.
Frida::: Heh, lucky you.
Ronnie Anne:::  Huh? I thought he loved that whale.
Carlos::: When he plays with something for too long he gets sick of it.
Ronnie Anne::: He does?
Ronnie Anne:::  Oh, I wanna play too.  Let's play. Cannonball!
Carlitos:::  Dadda.
Carlos::: Madre Mia,  it's happening. Frida!
Ronnie Anne:::  It's been fun, little dude.
Carlitos:::  Ronnie Anne.
Ronnie Anne::: I might not be Carlitos' favorite anymore, but at least he knows my real name.
Frida:::  Hey dudes,  it's me, Ronnie Anne, just coming to play with Carlitos.
Ronnie Anne::: Tía Frida,  it's okay, you don't have to do that.
Frida::: I'm not Tía Frida, I'm Ronnie-
