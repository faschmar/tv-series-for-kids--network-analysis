Lincoln:::  Ah. There's nothing like the smell of a new Ace Savvy comic.
Clyde:::  Mmm. It's like recycled paper and justice.
Clyde:::  Ugh! What is that smell? It's like sauerkraut and hot garbage!
Lincoln:::  There's only one way to find out: we'll have to investigate...  ...Ace Savvy style!
Clyde::: The gas is everywhere! There's no way to tell which direction it's-  Ugh.  I seem to have stepped in some sort of lumpy, viscous ooze!  Look!
Lincoln::: Follow that ooze!
Clyde:::  The gas is thicker here.
Lincoln::: Then we must be getting close. Keep a sharp eye out, Jack!
Clyde:::  I'm way ahead of you.
Clyde::: A giant gas monster! I should have recognized its foul stench!
Lincoln:::  It's time to deal out some justice!
Lincoln and Clyde:::  YAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!  Oof!
Clyde:::  We pierced right through him!
Lincoln::: Yet he's somehow able to grab us!
Clyde::: Looks like we have to fold!
Lincoln::: This game's not over yet, Jack! It's time to call in...  ...the whole deck!
Lori::: All right, girls, let's shuffle up and deal with this gas bag!
Luan::: Obviously, you're not playing with a full deck!
Luna::: Time to jam! 
Lola::: Time to gem! 
Lana::: Nothing beats a royal flush! 
Lynn:::  This water will suit you just fine!
Lucy::: I really dig what you're wearing.
Leni::: It really makes your eyes pop!
Lisa::: It's time to contain this gastroenterological beast! 
Lily::: 
Lincoln::: Thanks to all of you, the world can breath easy once more. The gas monster is contained, and Lily has a fresh diaper!  When the chips are down, I can always count on my sisters to help save the day.
Rita:::  Kids! Time to take out the trash! It's really piling up down here!
Full House Gang::: YAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!
