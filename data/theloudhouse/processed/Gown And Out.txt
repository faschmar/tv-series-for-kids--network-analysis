Cheryl::: Welcome back to the Little Miss Royal Woods Pageant. Up next, we are kicking off the talent portion with Lola Loud and her famous ribbon dance!
Lola::: It's Lola.
Lincoln::: Notice how the ribbon never touches the floor. Sign of a real pro.
Cheryl::: How would you define true beauty?
Lola::: To me, true beauty means having big hair and an even bigger heart.
Crowd:::  Awwwwww!
Lincoln::: Yes! Perfect balance of sap and sass.
Lynn::: Ok, how do you know this junk?
Lincoln::: Do you seriously not remember when I was the twins' pageant coach?  Shhh! They're announcing the winner!
Cheryl::: And your next Little Miss Royal Woods is...!  You guessed it.  Lola!
Lola:::  Whaaat?
Rita::: Oh, we are so proud of you, sweetie!
Lola::: Thanks, you guys. It was nothing.
Cheryl:::  I have some exciting news, sweetie. Winning this title qualifies you for the Little Miss Southeastern Michigan Pageant!
Lola:::  Wha-? A-A regional pageant? I've never competed at that level before.
Cheryl::: Pack your bags! Cause it's a coming up next weekend!
Lola::: Wow!
Lynn Sr.::: Next weekend? I have my pastry workshop.
Rita::: And I have my dental conference.
Lola::: But, but it's my first shot at the big time!
Lori:::  Are you looking at me? I can feel you looking at me. Uh, look, no offense, but being a pageant chaperone... isn't really how I planned to spend my weekend.
Rita::: What if we threw in a spa package? Hmm?
Lori::: You literally have a deal.
Lola:::  Thanks, Lori!
Lola::: Lola Loud, checking in for Little Miss Southeastern Michigan.  Hi, I'm Lola. Isn't it exciting to be competing in the big leagues?
Chinah::: Well, not as exciting as nationals last year. It could be fun. Hi, I'm Chinah, with two H's.
Jackie::: She holds the record for the most titles won before age 7.
Chinah::: Oh, that's nothing. Jackie here does toothpaste commercials.
Claudette::: And my name is Claudette.
Lola::: Woah! Are those sequins French crystal?
Claudette::: Oui. All of my gowns are made in Paris. Aren't yours?
Lola::: 
Lori::: Come on, Lola, I've got our room key.
Lola::: Heh, oh darn. Gotta run.  Okay, okay, stay cool, Lola. Just 'cause these girls have fancy dresses, shiny teeth, and names with extra letters doesn't mean you can't compete with them, heh! 
Lori::: Well, good luck at rehearsal. Not that you need it.
Lola::: Thanks, sis. Enjoy your spa day.
Lori::: Ah, believe me. I will.  What do you mean you're full? Can't you please squeeze me in? I'll take your worst masseuse.
Clerk::: Mmm, I'm afraid Greg's booked, too. We had like 12 pageant moms request deep tissue.
Lori:::  Yeah, I get that. It's okay. I'll just try again tomorrow.
Pageant Mom::: Ow! Greg, that's my spleen!
Dana::: Next up, talent! Jackie, let's see your gymnastics routine.
Lola::: Oh, tumbling. Cute.
Dana:::  And there she goes! Giant swing with a full release! She spins 360 degrees and a half turn with climb, jump, and a handstand!
Lola::: 
Jackie::: Eh, not my best.
Dana::: Next up, we have Lola performing...Oh, a-a ribbon dance. Cute.
Dana::: What is the single most significant event in human history?
Chinah::: Great question! It depends whether we approach from a socioeconomic or geopolitical perspective.
Lola:::  Gah, excuse me! Excuse me!
Lori::: Oh, hey, beauty queen. How were rehearsals? Did you kill it?
Lola::: Uh...yeah. You know it. Crown's in the bag. Uh...I'm just gonna go steam up my pores for tomorrow.
Lincoln::: Lola, what's wrong?  Did your hair fall flat?
Lola::: No, it's not my hair. It's the other contestants. They're... um... 
Lincoln::: What was that?
Lola::: They're... BETTER than I am! What if I don't win? What if I looo... loooo... ooooo...  I can't even say it without getting nauseous!
Lincoln::: Lola, you're not going to lose! You're a pageant powerhouse! Now make sure you get to bed early tonight, you don't want to wake up all puffy eyed and blotchy.
Lola::: Yeah, yeah...  Or do I...?
Lori:::  Ah!  Lola! What happened?
Lola:::  I don't know. I do feel a little under the weather, but, the pageant must go on.
Lori:::  Whoa, whoa, whoa. You are clearly sick. I'm so sorry, Lola, I know how much you wanted to compete but, you just can't.
Lola:::  That's alright. I'll get over it, someday.  Well, enjoy the spa.
Lori::: Pssh, forget the spa. I am staying right here. Maybe a fun sister day will help cheer you up.
Lola::: What?! No! Y-Y-You don't have to do that.
Lori::: I know I don't have to, I want to. Now, sit tight. I'm gonna hit the gift shop for supplies.
Lori::: I'm back~!  Oh, good, the flowers and balloons arrived. First up, mani-pedis. I got coral and sea foam, you get first pick.
Lola::: 'Whoa, these are the fancy brand.
Lori::: What's money when you have a sick sister?
Lola::: Ugh.
Lori:::  Room service? I'd like two chocolate chip cookies. Warm please, with your coldest milk.
 Lola::: But those cookies are $5.95 each!
 Lori::: What else am I going to do with my really hard earned babysitting money?
 Lori::: And, the winner of the Little Miss Unsightly Skin Rash Pageant is... Miss Lola Loud!  Oh, Little Miss Unsightly Skin Rash. 
Lori::: Lola! What's wrong? Is your condition getting worse?
Lola::: No, I don't have a condition, unless you count being a terrible person. I'm not really sick. I faked all this with makeup to get out of the pageant. 
Lori::: But why? I don't understand.
Lola:::  Well, I've never competed at this level before, and the other girls are really talented. I couldn't stand the idea of lo--lo--lo... 
Lori::: Losing?
Lola::: Yeah, that thing. I'm sorry I lied. I understand if you're mad.
Lori:::  Actually, Lols, I'm not.
Lola::: Really?
Lori::: No, I get it. I almost skipped homecoming because I was worried I wouldn't win queen.  But... in the end, I sucked it up, put on my dress, and went anyway.  And I'm so glad I did.
Lola:::  But, I thought Carol Pingrey won homecoming queen?
Lori::: Oh, she totally did,  and it definitely hurt at first.  But, if I hadn't have gone, I would have missed out on an amazing night.  The competition is going to get tougher as you get older, but you can't let it stop you from-
Lola:::  Doing what makes me happy?
Lori::: Exactly! So what do you say? You still wanna do this thing?
Lola:::  Yes, but it's too late, the pageant starts in ten minutes and look at me, I'm a complete disaster.
Lori::: Don't worry, I'm calling an expert. 
Lincoln::: Okay Lori, grab a makeup wipe, the one with the green tea extract, we don't need to be irritating the skin right now.
Lori:::  One with green tea extract, check.
Lincoln::: And, start warming up the curling iron while you're at it.  The one inch barrel, not the three quarters? Have you ever heat styled before, woman?
Dana::: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Little Miss Southeastern Michigan Pageant.  Beautiful girls, I'm talking 'bout the beautiful girrrrls.  Just crazy for the beautiful girrrrrrrrls.
Lori::: Go get 'em, Lola.
Lincoln:::  Remember; eyes forward, chin up, tushy clenched.
Dana::: Let's meet our contestants  Let's hear it for these beautiful girrrrrrls.  Lola Loud and her ribbon dance. 
Lincoln::: It's like she's one with the ribbon.
Lori::: Literally.
Lola::: As partial as I am to a sparkly tiara, I'd have to say that a girl's most important accessory is her brain.
Audience::: A good answer!
Lincoln::: Yes.
Lori::: So good.
Dana::: Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in. Can we please bring out all our beautiful girrrrls?  The second runner up to Little Miss Southeastern Michigan is... Claudette!  The first runner up iiiissssssss... Jackie! 
Lola:::  Oh my gosh, one left, I could win, I could still-
Dana::: And your next Little Miss Southeastern Michigan iiiiiiiissssssssssssssss...  Chinah!  She's Little Miss Southeastern Michigan.
Lori::: Lols,  You were so great, Lola.
Lincoln::: Way to go.
Lola:::  Congratulations, Chinah.
Audience::: Good job, Chinah.
Lori::: Aww, you done good out there, sis.
Lincoln::: Your best work since last fall's Little Miss Fusion Cuisine Pageant.
Lola::: Thanks guys, you were right, Lori. Even though I lo-, lo-.  didn't win,  I'm really glad I did it.
Jackie::: Nice job, Lola, we're gonna have to watch out for you next year. 
Lincoln::: Speaking of next year, Lola, I think we should add some tumbling moves to your ribbon dance, I'll-
Lori::: Goodbye, Lincoln. Now come on, you and I are going to hit the spa for some well deserved pampering. Word of advice though, do not ask for Greg.
