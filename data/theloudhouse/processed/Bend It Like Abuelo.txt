Ronnie Anne, Sergio & CJ::: Gatos! Gatos! Gatos! Gatos!
Rosa:::  Gatos?! Where? Where?
Ronnie Anne::: Not real cats, Abuela. The soccer team!
Rosa::: Oh. Well, when those real gatos get here... I'll be ready.
Vito:::  I don't know what you's are so excited about. Everyone knows the gatos lose every game.
Hector::: This is not just a game.  It's the Crosslake Championship!
Vito:::  Oh. So they're gonna be big losers! I've got my money on anyone who's not The Gatos.
Hector::: Just wait. Our star player, Picosito, is gonna win this year. When he's hot, ay-yi-yi, he's hot!
Vito::: Too bad he's been ice cold for years.  Picosito is no longer neato.
Carl::: Hey, Vito, bet you wouldn't say that if he were here.
Vito:::  I sure would. I'd tell him that he and the Gatos stink like yesterday's kitty litter!
Ronnie Anne::: Picosito!
CJ::: He's here!
Vito:::  Wha?
Hector:::  Picosito! I'm Hector Casagrande.  Oh, it's an honour to have you in our mercado.
Carl::: Why do they call you Picosito?
Picosito::: I don't know.  May I have seventeen orders of your chile chicharones? Extra picosos, por favor!
Carl::: Oh, I get it now.
Carlos:::  Oh, let me prepare those for you, Picosito.  Es un honor.  Caliente! Order up, Picosito.
Hector::: I'm your biggest fan! I've never missed a game! Can I get a picture?
Picosito::: As long as I don't have to stop eating this. Mas chile, porfis!
Vito:::  Say, Gatos.
Family::: Gatos!
Rosa:::  Where?
Hector::: I'm never washing my head again.
Rosa::: When did you start?
Announcer::: Picosito breaks down the middle. Take the pass from Flores. Goal!  Picosito has been en fuego tonight!  What a crazy change of fortune for Los Gatos!
Vito::: How is this even possible? These guys were dogs!  Uh, no offence, Big Tony and Little Sal.
Hector:::  I'll tell you how it's possible. Picosito rubbed my lucky bald head!
Vito::: I… I think you're right, Hector. They were terrible before they rubbed your big cabeza.  Working on my Spanish.
CJ::: Abuelo, you know what this means?
Carl::: If Picosito wants to keep winning, he has to keep rubbing your head!
Vito:::  Hey, I could use some luck.
Hector:::  Uh-uh-uh! This head is for Gatos only!  Meow!
Rosa:::  Did I get the gato?
Hector::: Excuse me, but Picosito has to rub my head.
Security Guard::: You got a ticket?
Hector::: They were sold out!
Security Guard::: Well then I can't help you, pops.
Hector::: Guess I'm out of luck, and so are the Gatos.
Mascot:::  Where's my flea collar?
Security Guard:::  Go ahead, Mr. Gato.
Hector::: Meower Power.
Security Guard::: Meower Power indeed. 
Hector::: Picosito!
Announcer::: Hey! Look who it is! It's Mr. Gato!  Time to do the Gato Boogie!
Crowd:::  Meow, meow, meow!
Hector:::  Meow, meow, meow! Meow, meow, meow!  Go, Gato, go!  Gato, rub my head!
Picosito::: Huh?
Hector::: It's Hector Casagrande!  You know the handsome guy from the mercado?  I'm your lucky charm!
Picosito::: Aye, señor, you know how many people think they're our good luck charms?
Hector:::  You're right, I'm just an old fool.  Okay, no hard feelings. High five!
Security Guard:::  Come on, Pops, the game's starting and you're getting on my nerves.
Announcer::: Goal! Let's take a look at that again!  Picosito scores on the opening kick-off!  Increible! Que emoción!
Picosito:::  Hey, security! On second thought, don't kick that guy out.  He's our lucky charm. Welcome to the team, Hector!
Crowd:::  Hec-tor! Hec-tor! Hec-tor! Hec-tor!
Picosito:::  Team, good game yesterday. Another win all because of our lucky charm, Hector Casagrande! So don't forget to rub Hector's head.
Hector::: Kept it warm for you.  That's it. Make it count, muchachos! We're gonna win.  Aww! The wrong team is winning! My luck has worn off. We're toast if I don't do something.
Hector::: Rosa, the Gatos are losing, even with the whole team rubbing my lucky head! You have to restart my luck and fast. The game is already half over!
Rosa::: I'll have to use all the remedios in my good luck arsenal.  We'll start with a good luck smoothie packed with herbs like artemisia.  Doesn't that sound delicious?
Hector:::  It may sound delicious, but it tastes like a dirty pata!
Carl::: Hurry up with the sage. The second half is about to start!
Rosa::: You're right. We'll need to turbo sage you.  After the herbs and sage, I recommend this. 
Hector::: A mini Hector?
Rosa::: Even better. A magical mini Hector! I had it custom-made from Ernesto Estrella's website.
Hector::: Hijole! How is this helping my luck?
Rosa::: It isn't. You just need the exercise.
Hector::: Rosa, do something!
Rosa::: Lalo! Bad dog!
Rosa::: How do you feel now, Hector?
Hector::: I feel pretty lucky, to be alive.
Hector::: Picosito! I'm back!
Picosito::: Abuelito, forget it.  Your lucky bald head is just a bald head.
Hector::: You don't understand. I recharged it! It's lucky again!
Picosito:::  Mi dedo gordo!
Rosa:::  Ay, poor Gatos. I don't know what's wrong with my remedies. Hector is still unlucky.
Carlos:::  Oh, I don't know about dad, but I've been very lucky today. I found a twenty-dollar bill in a wallet I thought I had lost.
Sergio:::  Easy come, easy go.
Carlos::: See? Can't lose! Everything's been coming up Carlos. Except for these new chonies Frida got me.  It's been chafe city all day.
Rosa:::  These aren't yours. They're Hector's jalapeño chonies!
Carlos::: That's another trauma for the books 
Rosa::: Hector wore these yesterday.
Carl::: And the day before.
Rosa::: What if it was Hector's chonies that brought the good luck?  Hector, I know why you've been unlucky. You've been wearing the wrong chonies! We're on our way.  We don't have time to bring you food too.
Carlos:::  Dad!
Rosa:::  Hector!
Hector::: What took you so long? There's only two minutes left and they're down by five!
Rosa:::  Watch how you talk to me or I'll use the doll again.
Hector::: I mean, thank you, mi amor.
Carlos::: Quick, put these on.  They're what make you lucky.
Hector::: Ah, híjole! Why is it so hard to run?
Guard #2::: Hey!
Announcer::: What's this? We have another runner! Zoom in, Manuel! Por favor!  It's former team lucky charm, Head Rub Hector!  And security tries to nab him, but Hector dodges and shoots them with the ball launcher! 
Picosito::: Ay, no, Don Hector. Please don't make me rub your head again.
Referee:::  Interference! 
Hector::: But it'll work this time! I'm wearing my lucky chonies!  We're gonna win. Trust me!
Picosito::: I don't need your chonies or your head!
Hector::: Yes you do!  Just rub my head!  Noogies count!
Announcer::: Jalapeño Chonies Man is being dragged out of the stadium for interference and bad taste in undergarments!
Hector:::  Gatos foreverrrrr!
Rosa::: Hector! The Gatos won! You did it!
Announcer::: Picosito scored six goals in the last two minutes! Unbelievable! That was the biggest comeback in sports history!  Goal!
Crowd::: Chonies! Chonies! Rah, rah, rah! Jalapeño, jalapeño! Hot, hot, hot!
Hector's Familia:::  Chonies! Chonies! Rah, rah, rah! Jalapeño, jalapeño! Hot, hot, hot!
Picosito::: Hector, thank you for your good luck, but mostly for being our fanatico numero uno!  This is for you, the winning ball!
Hector::: Oh, gracias, Picosito! And we have a gift for you and the team.
Rosa::: Lucky jalapeño chonies!
Picosito::: I hope they're not made with real jalapeños.
Sergio:::  They are!  It burns!  Ay, que rico!
