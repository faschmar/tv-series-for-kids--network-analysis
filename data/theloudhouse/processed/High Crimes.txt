Lincoln::: Okay. Here it comes! Uh! 
Clyde:::  It's all you, Nana.
Nana Gayle::: Hiya!  Myrtle, are you okay?
Myrtle::: Sorry, Lincoln. I could have swore that I was more athletic than this.
Lincoln:::  That's okay.  I love these after school badminton games, even if we lose every time.
Nana Gayle::: We could try lawn bowling tomorrow.
Myrtle:::  I wish. All the lawn-- bowling pins are missing.  And the shuffleboard sticks. And the shuffleboard too. 
Nana Gayle::: Jeez, this place is turning into a dump.  Let's see if there's anything better to do inside. 
Nana Gayle::: Oh, wow. What's all this?
Vic::: There. How's that, Scoots?
Scoots::: It stinks, Vic. This ain't no kiddie party.  This is Tyler's graduation from DJ school.
Tyler::: 
Scoots::: Took him six years, so I need the best balloons ya got.
Vic:::  Ugh. You've already had me redo them three times.  'Try the family business,' Mom says. 'Your political career failed,' Mom says.  'You have no other options,' Mom says.  Hey! You're wasting the helium. Do you know how much that cost? Argh. 
Flip::: Hey, watch it, balloon boy. I got a Flippee masterpiece going on over here. 
Bernie & Pop-Pop::: Whoo! Partay!
Flip:::  Ahh! Dang it!
Tyler::: My dudes, you're just in time for the pudding blast!
Scoots:::  Ahh!
Bernie & Pop Pop:::  Ahh!
Scoots:::  Hey, what the heck?  Someone broke the pudding pump.  This is getting me hot under the collar.
Seymour::: No, that's the AC. It's out! 
Bernie:::  Man, this joint is unlivable. 
Myrtle::: Maybe we should consider moving. This place is bumming me out. 
Lincoln::: This is terrible. We can't let our grandparents move.
Clyde:::  I know.  Sunset Canyon used to be such a great place. I was looking forward to my own retirement here.
Lincoln:::  Now it's falling apart. Something fishy is going on. You know, Clyde, this reminds me of a David Steele comic. Volume three, issue two.
Clyde::: When David tried to save the ice cream factory and got stuck in the bin of peppermint bubblegum?
Lincoln::: No, no, no, no. The one where Golden Toe sneaks into David's lair and sabotages it so David would have to move.
Clyde::: Oh right. That was actually issue five.
Lincoln::: My point is, I think someone is sabotaging Sunset Canyon to drive everyone out.
Clyde::: The missing sports equipment, the broken pudding machine?  The AC? It makes perfect sense.
Lincoln::: The question is who? And why? Clyde, we've got a mystery to solve.  Lisa, are Mom and Dad home? I need my David Steele spy gear STAT. I've got a Sunset Canyon emergency. Uh, what do you mean you're gonna bring it? You can't drive.
Lisa::: Hello, boys.
Lincoln:::  So did you bring my spy stuff?
Lisa::: Sheesh, those were toys. Dare-bot, if you please.  I took the liberty of upgrading everything. Let me walk you through it. 
Clyde::: Oops. Maybe I should let you explain first. 
Lisa::: Okay. You've got bifocal cameras, hearing-aid two way radios, rocket dentures, and, oh, this is my favorite: A remote walker launcher. All accessible through your watches, of course.
Lincoln and Clyde:::  Whoa! 
Lisa::: You'll also need disguises.  Now get back in there and crack this mystery. 
Clyde::: Okay, we're in. Now, what would David Steele do?
Lincoln & Clyde::: Check the security cameras.
Clyde::: How are we going to get past her?
Lincoln::: Leave it to me.  Hello, young person. Can I interest you in a hard candy? 
Receptionist::: Candy? From a stranger? Don't mind if I do!
Lincoln::: Wow, Lisa's chamomile sleepy-time hard candies work instantly.
Clyde::: Ooh, I hope her nose is okay.
Lincoln::: Dang it! The cameras are disabled. The culprit was ahead of us.
Seymour:::  Ugh!
Lincoln::: What was that?
Lincoln & Clyde::: Seymour!
Clyde::: We'll grab you some ice.
Lincoln:::  Clyde, look!  Someone's messing with the drainage controls. That's where the water is gone.  Hey, you! Get back here!
Lincoln::: He's getting away! Stop!
Clyde::: You are busted, sir. We know you've been sabotaging Sunset Ca--  Nana Gayle?
Nana Gayle::: Who the heck are you two?
Lincoln::: It's us, Lincoln and Clyde.
Clyde::: Nana Gayle, why'd you turn to a life of crime?
Nana Gayle::: Oh, Clyde. I'm not the bad guy, I went undercover to find him. I don't want to move out of Sunset Canyon. I just unpacked.
Lincoln::: Huh. What a twist.  So do you want to join forces? We can share our Intel, and you can share yours.
Nana Gayle::: I'm in. So whatcha got?
Lincoln::: Nothing. You?
Nana Gayle::: Also nothing. Oh, well, that's disappointing. But I was about to check clues by the pool's control panel.
Clyde::: Oh yeah, maybe there's something there.
Lincoln:::  I'll send this to Lisa for analysis.  Okay, the print is from a non-orthopedic work boot.
Nana Gayle::: Well, that rules out everyone at Sunset Canyon. Everyone here wears orthopedics. And why not? They're comfortable and surprisingly stylish. 
Clyde::: So our culprit must not live or work here.
Lincoln:::  Let's check the guest log. 
Nana Gayle::: Excuse me, I need help. This light on my phone won't turn off. And when I push this button...  It just gets brighter.  Never mind, I'll ask my grandson.  Whoo! What do we got boys?
Lincoln::: They only guest for the day were me and Clyde, and Flip, Gus and Vic,  who were setting up for the party.
Clyde::: It's got to be one of them. Time to take this investigation on the road! We're gonna need some wheels.
Nana Gayle::: Don't worry; I've got us covered.
Clyde::: First us, Gus'. Uh, you might want to stay here, Nana. This could get rough.
Lincoln::: Wait, we didn't ask any questions.
Clyde:::  Ah, he distracted us with pizza.
Clyde::: Gus is clear. His nonslip kitchen clogs didn't match the print. 
Lincoln:::  We didn't get our guy but we did get our dessert. 
Vic::: Here, it's a snake.
Girl::: Aw, I wanted a puppy.
Clyde:::  Vic, are you the one that's sabotaging Sunset Canyon?
Vic:::  No, and unless you're gonna buy a balloon, please leave. You're annoying me.
Clyde::: Well, what about the shoes? Do they match the-- 
Lincoln::: Oh, that's right. He was wearing roller skates.
Vic::: Just keeping it fun.  Here, it's a... it's a worm.
Lincoln::: It's gotta be Flip. He's the only suspect left.  Flip?
Flip::: Shh. Watch out. Spider on the loose. And he's a big fella. 
Lincoln:::  Flip, did you sabotage Sunset Canyon?
Flip::: You think I got time for stuff like that? I've been too busy trying to catch this beast.  Huh? 
Nana Gayle::: I think he's telling the truth.  Look at his feet. Not a match.
Flip:::  Yeah, I've been shoeless for days. I can't wear 'em again until my open wound clears up.  That spider got a chunk of Flip, but I'll get it back. 
Lincoln::: Now what? We're out of leads.  Huh?
Bernie::: Okay, there we go.  Ohh.
Clyde::: What's going on now?
Bernie::: The hot water's broken, kid.
Old Lady:::  The board is shutting down Sunset Canyon for good. 
Nana Gayle::: I guess I'll start boxing my stuff. 
Clyde::: We blew it, Lincoln. This is just like volume two, issue six.  David Steele blows it. Oh. 
Lincoln::: No, we can't give up. We have to find this fool so our grandparents don't move.
Clyde::: You're right.  There must be something we missed. Seymour said the hot water's out. Maybe there's a clue by the water heater.
Lincoln:::  It's in the basement. Come on.
Lincoln::: I can't see anything.
Clyde::: Hmm, maybe Lisa's watch has a light.  Uh-oh, I think we accidentally activated the rocket walker. 
Lincoln:::  That one is our bad. Weird, why do I sound like an elf?
Clyde:::  Me too.
Lincoln::: It's like we're breathing helium. Whoa, we are breathing helium.  That machine looks like it's sucking it out from the walls.
Clyde::: And what's with all the balloons?
Lincoln & Clyde::: I know who the culprit is!  Come on out, Vic.
Vic::: So you figured it out. The guy with the family balloon business who wanted access to the ginormous helium deposit under Sunset Canyon.
Clyde::: You almost got away with it too.
Lincoln::: You even put on roller skates to throw us off.
Vic:::  Well, aren't you just a regular David Steele. Too bad I have a getaway plan. You'll never stop me! Yah! 
Lincoln::: Come on, Clyde.
Lincoln::: Vic's been sabotaging Sunset Canyon trying to get everyone to move.
Nana Gayle::: Come on, everyone.
Lincoln:::  Over there, he's trying to escape.
Vic::: Ha-ha! See ya, losers. 
Lincoln::: Oh, no you don't.
Clyde:::  I got ya, Lincoln.
Nana Gayle:::  Be careful, Clyde.
Vic:::  Oh, get off.
Nana Gayle::: We need to pop his balloons.
Clyde:::  Lincoln, the rocket dentures in the watch!
Clyde::: Guess you can say that wraps up this case.
Lincoln::: Yep. Just one thing left, what to do with Vic. 
Scoots::: As head of the board, I say he fixes everything. Come on, let's hit the hardware store. You're buying!
Nana Gayle::: Great work, detectives. You saved our home.
Myrtle:::  Here, have a celebratory candy. I just found them.
Lincoln and Clyde::: Oh, no. Chamomile.
