Lincoln::: Watch in awe, as The Amazing Lincoln displays his unbelievable yo-yo skills! I shall now walk the dog!
Lincoln::: Not you, Charles. I meant the yo-yo.
Lincoln::: I shall now go AROUND THE WORLD!
Lincoln::: Sorry, still talking about the yo-yo.
Lincoln:::  The Amazing Lincoln will now take a brief intermission.
Lincoln::: Yikes. I better go tell Lisa.
Imaginary Lisa:::  'You've completely DESTROYED MY LIFE'S WORK! I DESPISE YOU, AND YOU NO LONGER EXIST TO ME!'
Lincoln::: Yeah, I'm not telling Lisa.  Oh, come on, Charles. When did you get a conscience? I've seen you poop on the couch! Besides, if I just walk away, what's the worst thing that could happen?  I'll just remove the evidence, and they'll be none the wiser.
Lisa::: I don't understand what went wrong. Science is a fickle mistress.
Leni::: Hi, Lori! Have we always had a window in our closet?
Lori::: Ugh, it's not a window. Lisa's experiment blew a hole in the wall.  What's this?  To my bodacious babe? Leni, why is this picture of Bobby hidden on your side of the closet?
Leni::: Oh, there is it is! That was a surprise present from Bobby for your 88-day-iversary. He asked me to hide it for him, but I forgot where I put it.
Lori:::  That anniversary was eight days ago, and Bobby gave me socks!  I can't believe this! You're literally seeing Bobby behind my back!  You are no longer my sister!
Lincoln:::  Everything okay after that unexpected and totally random explosion that I know nothing about?
Leni::: What happened?
Lincoln::: A shelf fell on your head.
Leni::: Of course! Everyone knows that an object falling at a velocity of 9.8 meters per second squared will result in a temporary loss of consciousness.
Lisa::: I knew that. The question is, how did you?
Lincoln::: Hey, I saw this in a movie once. I bet getting hit on the head altered Leni's brain and made her smart.
Lisa::: Lincoln, you seem unable to distinguish between scientific fact and preposterous Hollywood schlock.
Leni::: I don't get it.
Lisa::: See? Same old Leni.  Can't even understand simple English.
Leni:::  No, I don't get why you multiplied your Z polynomials before solving your non-negative integer exponents.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to disprove Newtonian physics. Buh-bye!
Lisa:::  My world no longer makes sense.
Lincoln::: Don't you have a couch to poop on?
Lincoln::: Charles, that was a rhetorical question!
Lincoln::: What are you so upset about?
Lynn::: I just got kicked off all my sports teams because I'm failing school!
Lincoln::: How could you fail? Doesn't Lisa tutor you?
Lynn::: She used to, until she dropped out and got a job as a gas station attendant at Flip's Food & Fuel.
Lincoln::: She WHAT?!
Lynn::: Ugh! Without sports, my life is meaningless! 
Lola:::  I present to you your new Miss Cute and--  OH, MY NOSE!
Lola:::  I am a hideous...monster.
Lincoln::: It's not that bad, Lola.
Lola::: MY PAGEANT CAREER IS OVER!
Lola::: OH, MY TEETH! 
Lincoln::: Fine, I'll fix it.
Lincoln::: Lisa, why are you doing this?
Lisa::: Flip's the only guy who will hire four-year-olds with no experience.
Lincoln::: No, I mean, why are you doing any of this? Come home. Lynn needs you!
Lisa::: Why don't you get Miss Smarty-Pants to help her!  Speak of the Devil. Regular or unleaded?
Leni:::  Oh, I don't need gas. I just won the Nobel Prize for inventing a car that runs on apple juice.
Lisa:::  Of course you did.
Leni:::  Fill 'er up, please!
Lincoln::: And then we'll all get in Leni's juice-mobile, go home, and forget all this nonsense.
Leni::: Can't! I'm off to Harvard! Au revoir, adios, auf Wiedersehen, and aloha!
Lisa::: A-HA! Aloha means Hello!
Leni::: It also means Goodbye! 
Lisa::: Dang it. I used to know that.
Flip::: Hey, Chatty Cathy, BACK TO WORK!
Lincoln::: Hello? Charles? She's WHAT?! Alright, I'm on my way!
Lincoln::: Look who it is, Miss Soon-to-heal.
Lola::: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
Lincoln::: AAAAAHHH! I mean, you're looking better!
Lola:::  Oh, nice try, Lincoln, but I am out of here! I can't stay where I'm... CONSTANTLY REMINDED OF MY FORMER SELF!  My beautiful, beautiful self.
Lincoln::: But...But...
Lola:::  I'll send for this! 
Lincoln::: Lola, wait!
Lana::: Careful, Lincoln! You could get seriously injured!
Lincoln::: Lana, what are you doing in there?
Lana::: I saw what happened to Lola. Life is a fragile thing. I don't want to take any risks.
Lincoln::: But you're the queen of risks!
Lana::: Was the queen of risks! From now on, I'll stay in here, where it's safe! You know what I'm talkin' about, huh, Geo?
Lincoln::: Lana, you can't be serious!  Lana?!
Luna:::  Things have gotten drastic. Now, my sister lives in plastic. Where did it all go wrong?
Lincoln::: Luna?
Luna:::  Check it, bro. I uploaded a song I wrote about our family going down the Highway to--HELLO! I just got fifty more hits!
Luna:::  Mick Swagger?!
Mick::: Your singing is amazing! You gotta join my tour! 
Luna::: Luna is IN!
Lincoln:::  Don't you leave, too! THE FAMILY'S FALLING APART!
Luna:::  SORRY, DUDE!
Lincoln::: Clyde, this is Lincoln! Come in! I've got a Code Blue!
Clyde::: Code Blue?! You did something wrong and lied about it, and now everything is all messed up?!
Lincoln::: Affirmative! Can you come over?!
Clyde::: Negative. I've got a Code Green!
Lincoln::: You showed up to school in your underwear?
Clyde::: No, that's Code Orange. Hang on.
Lincoln::: SWEET MOTHER OF...What are you doing with Lori?!
Clyde::: I've been trying to tell you! A Code Green; Lori broke up with Bobby, and I'm the rebound guy!
Lori::: Happy eight-minute-iversary, Snookie-Booboo-Sugarbear.
Lincoln:::  WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MY FAMILY?!
Luan::: Knock-knock.
Lincoln::: Who's there?
Luan:::  This is not a joke, Lincoln. Do you know what's going on in the world? Here, take Mr. Coconuts. He just reminds me of all the trees being cut down in the rainforest. 
Lincoln::: Wait, Luan...  What brought this on?
Luan::: Well, ever since Luna left, I've had no one to try my jokes out on. So, I've been watching a lot of cable news, and what I've seen is horrific. So, I've decided to become...  AN ACTIVIST!
Lincoln::: Don't be ridiculous! You're a comedian!  See? Funny, right?
Lincoln::: What the heck was that?!
Luan::: They're just Lana's pets. I liberated them. And now, I'm off to heal this ticking time bomb we call Earth.
Lincoln::: Wait, Luan, you can't be serious!
Lincoln::: Get back here, Izzy!
Lincoln::: Izzy, come to Uncle Lincoln!
News Reporter:::  And now, for tonight's top stories. Former rising star Luna Loud was kicked off the Mick Swagger tour, for destroying a hotel room.
Luna:::  ALL I WANTED WAS A BLEEDING PILLOW MINT!
Lincoln::: Luna?
Reporter::: In a related story, former comedian turned activist Luan Loud has chained herself to a giant redwood.
Luan:::  Hey-hey, ho-ho! Keep your hands off, let it grow!
Lincoln::: Luan?!
Reporter::: I'm being told we have breaking news.
Lincoln::: Please don't be one of my sisters!
Katherine::: Tucker, I'm here at Flip's Food & Fuel, where two unknown bandits have just made off with a carload of beef jerky and a cotton candy machine!
Lisa::: They're not unknown, they're my sisters.  Their betrayal hurts more than this brain freeze.
Katherine::: I'm getting word that the bandits are currently leading police on a slow-speed chase!
Katherine::: One has to wonder, where did it all go wrong for these girls? And why is a four-year-old working at a gas station?
Flip::: Interview over! Wait, don't forget to come down to Flip's Food & Fuel, home of the Flippee! Now the interview's over. 
Lucy::: I was watching that.
Lincoln:::  Lucy! At least you're still normal!
Lincoln::: D'AAH! NOT NORMAL!
Lucy::: I was bitten by Lana's liberated vampire bat. Greatest! Day! EVER! 
Lincoln::: Nine sisters lost, but there's still one I can save!
Lincoln::: Lily?
Lincoln::: LILY!
Lincoln::: Oh no, Lisa's chemicals! What have I done?!
Lily::: Mmmm... yum yum!
Lincoln::: DON'T EAT ME, LILY!
Lincoln::: So that's the worst thing that could happen.  I totally agree! I'm going to tell Lisa!
Lisa:::  Tell Lisa what? 
Lincoln:::  I was playing with my yo-yo, and it got out of control, and it wrecked your experiment, and I'm really, really sorry! Go ahead and disown me, 'cause I deserve it!
Lincoln::: I'm confused. You're not mad?
Lisa::: Mad? I'm ecstatic! You proved my hypothesis! Your recklessness was the one variable my rigidly-controlled experiment sorely needed!
Lincoln::: I'm still confused.
Lisa::: I'm saying thank you for being a clumsy doofus. And thanks for admitting what you did.
Lincoln:::  I didn't have a choice.  I didn't want you to work at a gas station, or Lynn and Lola to turn to a life of crime, or Lana to live in a bubble, or...or...or...
Lisa::: Fascinating. Exposure to my chemicals seems to have damaged his cerebral cortex. 
Lincoln:::  Boy, am I glad that nightmare's over.
