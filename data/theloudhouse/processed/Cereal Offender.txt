Announcer::: Bored of the same old breakfast?
Lincoln:::  Yes...
Announcer::: Then try Zombie Bran! The cereal that turns you into the walking fed!
Zombie Girl:::  Braaaaan!
Zombie Boy:::  Braaaaan! BRAAAAAN!!
Lincoln:::  Must...have...Zombie Bran!  Mom! MOM!!
Rita::: What on Earth is down here?
Lincoln::: Mom! Mom! Can we please get Zombie Bran cereal?  Please please please please please please?
Rita::: Sorry, sweetie. We've got a very tight budget. And by the time I get everything on my grocery list, there's no money leftover for treats.
Lincoln::: Hmm...  What if I could get everything on here and still have enough money leftover for Zombie Bran?
Rita::: You wanna do the shopping for me? I don't know, Lincoln. It's a big responsibility; I'm not sure you can handle it.
Lincoln::: I can, Mom! I promise! And think of what you could do with all that time to yourself.
Rita::: Mmm...ah, yes...
Rita::: Deal. But just this once, okay?
Lincoln::: YES!!!  Braaaaan...BRAAAAAN!!!
Rita::: Oh, so that's it!  LUAN, NO MORE COMEDY PROPS IN THE SINK!!!
Lincoln::: Reusable bags, calculator, more reusable bags...
Lori::: Lincoln! I'm going shopping with you! Bobby literally just got a job as a stock boy.
Lincoln::: Sorry, guys. I'm a man on a mission and you'll just get in my way.
Lynn::: No we won't. Uh...we'll help you shop.
Lincoln::: Okay, fine. I guess I could use a little help.
Sisters::: YAY!!!
Sisters::: Aww...
Lincoln:::  Sorry, Lily. You're staying with Dad.  Ow!
Rita::: Alright, Lincoln. Here's the list, and here's exactly $200.  I'll be back in an hour! I'm off to get my first pedicure in 17 years!
Lincoln::: You will be mine.  Ready, guys?
Manager::: Whoa, whoa! What do you hooligans think you're doing?
Lincoln::: We're shopping for our mom, sir.
Lori:::  Bobby Boo-Boo Bear!
Bobby::: Babe!
Lori::: I love a man in uniform!
Bobby::: It's okay, boss. I know them.
Manager:::  Very reassuring, Boo-Boo Bear.  Huh...eggs, milk...okay, okay. Looks legit.  But any monkey business, and you're all out on your keisters! 
Lincoln::: Alright, guys, you heard him! You all have to be on your best behavior! Now, if we each take a section of Mom's list-
Lincoln::: I should have known...I've been played...
Lincoln::: I've got $200. I just need a way to save $4.  Ooh! 10 cents off the dented one! A couple more savings like this and I'll have enough for my Zombie Bran!
Lynn::: Yippee-ki-yay, market shoppers! YAYAYAYAYAYA-WOO! 
Lincoln::: Lynn!  Eject! EJECT!
Lynn::: Ah, nice! Ha ha! Soft landing.
Lincoln::: Ugh. Maybe for you.
Lincoln::: YEOWCH!  Okay. Where were we? Milk.
Luan::: Step right up, folks, to see some eggs-cellent juggling!  Get it?  Whoops! Oh, looks like the yolk's on you! 
Lincoln::: Luan! Cut it out! 
Luan::: Whoa! How's this for a balanced breakfast? 
Manager::: YEOWCH! WHO DID THIS?!  We've got a hooligan in our midst...
Luan::: Ah, he's no fun. I was on an egg roll! Get it? 
Lincoln::: Okay, that's another 50 cents saved for old lettuce.
Manager:::  Attention, shoppers! We have a 2 for 1 sale on waffles!
Lincoln::: Ooh! A sale!  2 for 1!  That puts me another buck closer to Zombie Bran!
Woman::: AAAHH!!! THERE'S A CHILD IN THE FROZEN PEAS!!! AAAHH!!! 
Lincoln::: Lisa! What are you doing?
Lisa::: Research for my cryogenic freezer. The future needs my brain.
Lincoln::: I don't believe this.
Manager::: Doh! Where did that hooligan go?
Lincoln::: Okay, tilapia. 
Leni::: Be free! The ocean's that way. Or is it that way?
Lincoln::: Leni! What are you doing?
Leni::: Can you believe people were going to eat these poor, helpless creatures? 
Lincoln::: Leni! No!
Lincoln::: YEOWCH! OW OW OW OW! 
Manager::: What the? Who did this?  I gotcha now.  YEOWCH! OW OW OW OW OW OW OW! 
Lincoln:::  Go go go go! What is wrong with you guys? I told you I was on a mission, and you're all-  Ooh! Another sale!
Luna:::  For those about to shop, I salute you!
Lincoln:::  Dang it... 
Luna::: GOODNIGHT, GROCERY STORE!!!
Manager:::  I'll get you yet...
Lincoln::: Let's see...value pack...family pack...ah, here we go! Village pack!  Check! Yes! That was the last item. And now for the moment of truth. And the grand total is...$196, which leaves...4 bucks for Zombie Bran! YES!!!  Phew. Last box. I can't believe it's really-
Bratty Kid::: Mine!
Lincoln::: Hey, you can't do that! I had it first!
Bratty Kid::: And I have it now, Pineapple Boy! 
Lincoln:::  Oh, you are going down... 
Manager::: Oh, you are going down... 
Lincoln::: Guys, please stop! You're gonna get us kicked out!
Leni::: Go, chickens! Be free!
Lincoln::: Please, stop! You're gonna get us kicked out! 
Sample Lady::: Sample, dear?
Lincoln::: Oh, thank you. 
Sample Lady::: Oh dear!
Lincoln::: Please, stop!
Lucy::: Sigh...
Lincoln::: Game over, cereal stealer!  Dang it...  Hey! 
Manager::: Gotcha, hooligan!
Bratty Kid's Mom:::  I can't believe you got us kicked out of here!
Bratty Kid::: Can I just get my cereal?
Bratty Kid's Mom:::  NO!
Bratty Kid::: But-but-but...my Zombie Bran!
Lincoln:::  YES!!! And now to get out before we're kicked out.
Lincoln::: Come on, people! Let's go! Move it!
Bobby::: Check it out, babe!
Lori:::  Oh, Boo-Boo Bear...you're such an amazing artist.
Bobby::: Nah, babe. You're just an amazing muse.
Lincoln:::  Let's go!
Lola::: Why are you pushing us?
Lincoln::: Because I'm this close to getting my cereal, and I don't want you guys to ruin it.
Lori::: Whoa, whoa, whoa! What do you mean your cereal?
Lincoln::: I made a deal with Mom. If I had enough money left after getting all the groceries, I could get my Zombie Bran.
Lana::: Well, if you get a treat, I want a treat!
Lola::: Yeah! I want little princess pies!
Lucy::: I want blood pudding.
Lisa::: I could re-up on my sodium bicarbonate.
Lana::: And I want dog biscuits!  They're for Charles! I swear! Even though they are great for my teeth, and my coat...
Lincoln::: No way! There's no money left!
Luna:::  Well, there will be if we put this back!
Lincoln::: Give me that! I worked my butt off to get it!
Bobby::: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Manager::: I thought I already got rid of you, hooligan! Now I want you out of my store! And take your sisters with you!
Manager:::  I'll take that!
Lincoln:::  But...but...  My Zombie Bran...
Manager::: Boo-Boo Bear! Push broom!
Rita:::  Well, isn't this wonderful. I guess I'll be shopping in the next town over for a while.
Lincoln::: I'm sorry, Mom. But it's not all my fault.
Rita:::  Mmm-I don't wanna hear about it. You told me you could handle the grocery shopping, but clearly you cannot.
Lincoln::: But Zombie Bran!
Rita::: You can forget about that cereal, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: But-
Rita::: End of discussion!
Announcer::: Bored of the same old breakfast?

Zombie Boy:::  Braaaaan! BRAAAAAN!!
Announcer::: Now in new Raisin the Dead flavor!
Sisters:::  BRAAAAN!!!
Lincoln:::  Very funny, guys. I'm not in the mood.  Whoa! Hey!
Lynn:::  BRAAAAAN!!!
Sisters:::  BRAAAAN!!!
Lincoln:::  You got me my cereal?!
Lori:::  It's the least we could do. The only reason you didn't get this was because of us.
Lincoln::: I only have one thing to say to you all.  OOH...BRAAAAAN!!!
Lily:::  BRAAAAAN!!!
