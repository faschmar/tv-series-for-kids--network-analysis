Announcer::: And here we see the eggs just about to hatch.  Oh, and here they come.
Sergio::: How do I look?  Sancho's having a rager.
Rosa::: Another party? At this hour?  Ay, I could never live with a pajaro like Sancho.
Sergio::: He can't help it. He's a wild animal.  Don't wait up. 
Sergio::: Sancho. Packed tonight.  Our favorite song!  Let's bird-booty-boogie, baby! 
Sergio:::  Best party ever. 
Ronnie Anne::: Come on, Sergio. It's time for breakfast.
Sergio::: Ugh, this headache is pounding.  Oh, it's you.  Party's over, dude.  Someone's after you?  Did you forget to pay the DJ?
Jim Sparkletooth::: This is Jim Sparkletooth with breaking news. A famous city sculpture has been-- pigeon pooped.
Marcus:::  This is the last caw!  I'll catch all those pigeons.  Then I'll bring their ring-leader to justice.
Sergio:::  You're innocent?  You want to stay here?  Oh, family won't like it, but anything for a friend.  I'll grab us food.  But you got to stay hidden.  Just be cool.
Sancho::: Coo coo.
Hector::: That's a lot of comida, Sergio. You better eat it all, otherwise, you're wasting money.  My money!
Sergio:::  Uh, don't worry. Got two stomachs. 
Hector:::  What are you waving at?
Sergio:::  Oh, uh, nothing.  Look, not a penny wasted. 
Hector::: Wow, you can fit so much food in your belly. I'm jealous. 
Sergio::: Mi est√≥mago.  Sancho? Hey!  Get back here!  Not! Cool!  You'll get me in trouble! Just sit and watch TV.  Sancho? Where are you?  Sancho, not time for a toilet bath.
Rosa:::  Ay! Perdon, Sergio!
Sergio:::  Almost done.
Rosa::: Okay, I'll be right outside.
Sergio:::  Sancho!  All yours. 
Rosa::: Ooh!
Sergio::: Phew. Now listen, no more messing around.  Oh, come on!  Where, where'd he go?
Bobby::: Woo-hoo!
Ronnie Anne::: Go, go, go!
Futbol Announcer::: Truly unbelievable match de futbol!  A breakaway! Puga stole the ball. 
Bobby::: Ah!
Maria::: The game!
Ronnie Anne::: Quick, to apartment 2B!
Sergio:::  That's it! You're out! 
Sancho::: Coo?
Sergio::: Why? You don't listen.  Can't follow rules. Bet you did poop on that statue.  Yeah, I said it.  Want my help? Here, wear this hat.  Nobody will recognize you. Good luck. 
Sergio:::  Finally, some me time. 
Jim Sparkletooth::: Breaking news, the last pigeon has been caught and taken to the pound.  Authorities say he was wearing a hat as a disguise. Did he really think that would work? Talk about a bird-brained idea. 
Marcus:::  I hereby sentence you to fifteen years in the pound. 
Sergio:::  I'm sick of TV. Let's go to the park. 
Sergio:::  I got it.  Aw, Sancho and I always woke up there after parties.  Wonder where Sancho's sleeping now.  Oh, park is boring. Let's go somewhere else. 
Sergio::: Oh, Sancho and I used to eat here all the time.  Wonder what he's eating now. 
Sergio:::  Aw, our favorite TV show. I wonder what Sancho is watching right now.  What have I done? Sancho may be a pain in the beak, but he's my best friend.  We gotta save him.
Sergio:::  Only one way in or out. --How are we gonna do this, Lalo?  Hmm, need a distraction.  For Sancho!
Vito::: Hey, whoa! It's raining pizza!  Hey, stop you two! Hey, that tickles.
Marcus:::  Don't worry, sir. Animal control to the rescue.  Ha!
Vito::: Hey, my dogs! 
Marcus::: My sky pizza!
Sergio:::  Grab the keys. I'll find Sancho.  Ah, Sancho! Came to rescue you!  Oh, hey, Omar. Looking swole.  Oh, come on. Don't be that way.  Hey, Lalo! Where are the keys?  Quit messing around.  Mm, pistachio.  Wait! This looks just like bird poop!  Sancho didn't do it!  Pigeons were framed! 
Sergio:::  Pigeons are innocent, but how do we prove it?  You drooling genius.  I get one phone call. I know my rights.
Marcus:::  Fine, but make it snappy. My battery's dying.
Sergio::: Ronnie Anne? We're at the pound.
Ronnie Anne:::  What?
Sergio::: Not my fault. Bring the Mercado security footage. I'll explain later.
Ronnie Anne::: Look, Mr. Animal Wrangler, these two are my family's pets. I'm sorry for whatever trouble they caused.
Marcus::: They were breaking and entering, kid. They've got to serve time.
Sergio:::  We're not the guilty ones.  Laptop me.  Poop was ice cream!  You framed the pigeons!
Ronnie Anne:::  I'm sending this video to Jim Sparkletooth unless you free everyone right-- now!
Marcus::: Fine! you caught me! I pistachio'd the statue and I'd do it again.
Sergio::: But why?
Marcus::: Because...  I never get invited to any of the pigeon parties, okay?  I wanted the pigeons locked up so there wouldn't be any more parties. Being left out hurts, you know?
Ronnie Anne::: Why would you want to go to a pigeon party, Mr. Animal Wrangler?
Marcus::: That's just my day job. I don't bring my work home with me. And I have a name. It's Marcus.
Everyone::: Aww...
Sergio::: Well, Marcus, I'm Sergio, and I know what you're doing tonight.
Sergio:::  Sorry for kicking you out, buddy.  And accusing you of pooping on the statue.  You're not a pain in the beak.  You're just a wild animal, like Marcus.
Marcus:::  Woo! It's my birthday. Mmm, mmm, mm-mm mm!
Sergio:::  We coo?
Sancho::: Coo.
Marcus::: All right.
