Carl:::  So you found me, Falcón… And here I thought you were all muscle and no brains!  The joke's on you! I am both! Eat my weapons of justice, evildoer!  Oh, man, El Falcón's the coolest! He really kicked Master Kitsune's butt!  I'll tell you how it ends tomorrow.
Lunch Lady::: Can't wait. Next!
Ricky::: Yeah, okay, do the thing.
Alexis::: Dairy's not really good for brass instruments.
Julius:::  Just do it already.  Hilarious!
Ricky:::  I like funny sounds.
Julius:::  Same time tomorrow, tuba boy!  I'll bring some more fun stuff for your horn. I'm thinking pickle juice!
Alexis:::  Please don't! And my name is Alexis.
Carl:::  What was that all about?
Alexis::: Oh, the usual.  Ricky and Julius picking on me like they do every day.
Carl:::  Dude, you let them do this you every day? Why?
Alexis::: What choice do I have? I'm a hugger, not a fighter.
Carl::: Well, good luck with that.
El Falcón::: Help him, Carl! For justice!
Carl::: Alexis, I'm gonna help. I'm gonna teach you how to be a tough guy so no one messes with you.
Alexis::: Uh, okay. First, let me just…
Laird::: Ugh. Mondays, am I right?
Carl::: Welcome to the Falcón School of Tough Guys! I'm your professor, Carl Casagrande. 
Alexis:::  Carl, what am I doing up here? 
Carl::: It's all about attitude!  We're building up your confidence.
Alexis::: By walking on stilts?
Carl::: It's an exercise. If you want to feel big you gotta act big!
Alexis:::  Right. I'm big. I'm a giant.  Hey a birdie.  I'm falling!  Are you okay, little guy? Let me just…  Oops, I got some of your poop back on you.  Don't worry, birdie. I'll clean you up.
El Faclón:::  We have a lot of work to do.
Carl::: Okay, now that you can walk the walk, mostly, it's time to talk the talk. Tough guys like me and El Falcón are all great at trash talk.  Check it!  Your shirt is lame.
Alexis:::  My dad bought me this shirt.
Carl::: Where'd he buy it? Lame-o's Warehouse?
Alexis:::  I think he got it at the mall.
Carl:::  No, that was an example of trash talk. Now you try.
Alexis::: Your house is really… cozy?
Carl:::  Wow, that was bad.  Okay, look, when in doubt… uh… make fun of their hair. That always works.
Alexis::: Uh… Your hair is.. not shiny?
Carl::: Ouch, man, hitting where it hurts.
Alexis::: I'm sorry I didn't mean…
Carl:::  No! Stand by what you said!  Plus, a tough guy never apologizes.  Now that you've got the basics down, let's try this for real.
Bobby:::  Hey, Carl, Alexis. How's it going?
Alexis:::  Bobby, your hair is so bad if you treated it with that dirty broom it'd still be an improvement!
Bobby:::  I got something in my eye. I'll be right back!
Carl::: You did it!  How does it feel?
Alexis::: Terrible. But powerful? But terrible.
Carl::: Great, now we're getting somewhere.
Bobby:::  Nooo! I look like a broom?!  Why didn't anyone tell me?!
Alexis::: I really do feel bad about that.
Carl::: Fight it! We still got work to do.
Carl:::  Now that you've got the attitude down, we gotta make you look scarier, too.  First of all, stop smiling all the time. Try making a mean face like this. Huh!
El Falcón::: That's not what I look like, is it?
Carl::: No!  You look like a cute kitten! I want to see a scary lion, bro.
Alexis::: Sorry! I guess I'm in too good a mood right now.
Carl::: Try to think about something that makes you angry.
Alexis:::  Maybe... not being able to go to band practice? No, that doesn't make me angry. It just makes me sad.  I love band practice.
Carl:::  Okay, stop. No tears. I'll figure out something else  That's it, you need a scar! Scars are tough.  Aha! 
Alexis:::  Please don't hurt me!
Carl:::  Relax, this won't hurt a bit.
Alexis::: My tough new look must be working. Everyone seems real scared of me.
Carl::: Yeah, they are. Plus I've been spreading rumors about you all morning. It's the final step in your tough guy makeover: Reputation.
Alexis::: What kind of rumors?
Girl #1::: I heard he made a grown man cry.
Girl #2::: I heard a pigeon pooped on him, and he got so angry that he pooped on him, back.
Carl::: What? It's a little bit true. Now go out there and don't let anyone mess with you anymore!
El Falcón::: Well done, Carl! You're a good person with very shiny hair.
Carl:::  Yes, I am. 
Julius::: Hey, tuba boy! We've got a bunch of new stuff to try today. Let's see how your tuba likes packing peanuts.  Dude, what's wrong with your face?
Alexis::: Nothing. My face is just like this. What's hm... wrong with your hair?
Julius::: What do you mean?
Alexis::: Oh, just that it looks grosser than the feathers of the pigeon I pooped on after I pooped on it.
Ricky:::  Hey, man. Not cool!
Alexis::: Whoops, sorry! I mean, ha, I totally meant to do that!
Ricky:::  That's it! Bike rack! After school!
Laird:::  Tuesdays, am I right?
Alexis::: Carl, I went too far! Ricky and Julius want to meet me at the bike rack! Nothing good happens at the bike rack.
Carl::: Huh, sounds like they want to fight you.
Alexis::: What do I do? Maybe I can talk to them and then hug it out.
Carl::: No! That's the weakness in you talking! You gotta take a stand, Alexis.
Alexis::: But it's two against one, I'm gonna get creamed.
Carl::: Don't worry. I'm coming with you, and I'll bring my boys.
Alexis::: Boys?
Students::: Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Boy #1::: It's a comb.
Boy #2::: Ah, that's not so bad.
Sergio:::  You messed with the wrong tuba boy!
Alexis::: Sorry, just give me one second.
Julius::: I'll give you one last chance to apologize.
Alexis:::  I apolog…
Carl:::  No way! You guys apologize! Then we won't kick your butt!
Students::: Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Ricky::: Let's do this!
Principal Valenzuela:::  What is going on here?!
Carl:::  Hey, Principal Valenzuela. So, funny story…
Principal Valenzuela:::  My office, now!
Principal Valenzuela::: Okay, start talking. Who started this and why?
All Four::: They did!
Principal Valenzuela:::  Fine. Then you're all going to be suspended!
Julius::: What?
Ricky::: Aw, man.
Alexis::: Does that mean I can't go to band practice? 
Carl::: Wait! It was my fault. Don't suspend Alexis, suspend me. I wanted him to fight. I thought if he stood up for himself he wouldn't get picked on anymore.
Alexis::: It's not all Carl's fault, he was just trying to help me. And he's right, I do need to stand up for myself. I just have to do it in my own way.  I really don't like it when you guys put weird things in my tuba. It's hard to clean and it always sounds bad afterwards.
Ricky::: But I like the funny sounds
Julius:::  We won't do it again.
Ricky:::  We're sorry.
Alexis:::  Great! So now can we hug it out?
Ricky::: What's a hug?
Julius:::  Sure.
Ricky::: I like hugs.
Julius::: Me too.
Principal Valenzuela::: Since you used your words to resolve this, no suspension this time. Bravo, boys.  One last thing, Mr. Flores. Are the rumours true? Did you really revenge poop on a pigeon? All the teachers are dying to know.
Alexis::: Maybe. Maybe not.
Principal Valenzuela:::  Sorry, ladies, I can't confirm or deny the rumors.
Carl:::  Wow, talking worked better than fighting.  I wonder why El Falcón doesn't do it more.
Alexis::: Maybe he just doesn't have a friend to teach him how. If you ever want to enroll in the Alexis Flores' School of Talking and Hugs…
Carl:::  Okay, fine, do it. But make it quick.
Alexis::: The hug might be short-lived, but the happiness stays forever.
Carl:::  Yeah, I guess this is kind of nice.
El Falcón::: Yeah, it kind of is.
Alexis:::  No one will ever mess with you again, Tuby.
Carl::: Laird?
Laird:::  Tuesday afternoons, am I right?
