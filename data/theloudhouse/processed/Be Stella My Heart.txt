Clyde::: Liam, would you be interested in my hand-cut sushi? It's Yellowtail.
Liam::: You know I am. Hey, you want my deviled eggs? They're farm-to-table.
Rusty::: Lincoln, is that your dad's homemade pudding?
Lincoln::: It is. What are you offering?
Rusty::: One bologna sandwich, fridge-to-table.
Lincoln::: Throw in your buffalo chips, and we've got a deal.
Zach::: So, no takers on my tuna kit?
Rusty::: Your mom's still buying those, huh?
Lincoln:::  Guys, here comes the new girl! .
Liam::: Ooo-wee, She sure is easy on the eyes.
Zach::: Oh yeah. And I hear she speaks three languages.
Clyde::: Have you guys heard her laugh? It's so... contagious.
Rusty::: I like the way her hair smells.  What? Too far?
Lincoln:::  Here she comes! Be cool! Be cool!
Stella::: Hey, guys. Anybody wanna trade for my carrots?
Stella::: Uhhhh...right. So, yeah. I’ll just, uh...yeah. 
Lincoln::: Wonder what that was all about?
Zach::: I don't know, but I'm glad we played it so cool.
Rusty::: Okay, guys, snake formation!
Zach::: Keep an eye out for Girl Jordan. Last time, she blindsided us.
Stella::: Hey, guys, what do you have going on here? Some kind of defensive maneuver? Can I get in on this?  Okay...well, good luck. 
Lincoln::: Seriously. Why does she keep coming over to us? 
Zach::: Aw, come on, Girl Jordan! Coach didn't even blow the whistle yet!
Clyde::: I think we can all agree I should handle the Bunsen Burner after what happened last time.
Zach::: Yeah. Rusty and his aftershave.
Rusty::: What can I say? It sets the ladies on fire too.
Stella::: Hey, guys, need another lab partner? Otherwise, I have to be with Mrs. Johnson. Not that she doesn't seem cool, but you know what I mean.
Rusty::: You burned off my mustache, Zach!
Zach::: It was like, two hairs, Rusty.
Lincoln::: I still don't get it. Why does Stella keep coming over to talk to us? That's three times in one day.
Liam::: Maybe she's trying to sell us a time-share.
Zach:::  Maybe she's spying on us for the CIA.
Rusty::: Guys, what you don't know about women could fill a library. She obviously has a crush on one of us.
Lincoln::: Now that you mention it, I was picking up some vibes.
Liam:::  Dang! I wonder who she likes?
Clyde::: I guess we'll just have to wait till she makes her next move.
Rusty::: I hope I have time to grow back my 'stache.
Rusty::: Anyone want some breath spray? Sour green apple, it's a total lady killer. 
Zach:::  I'll take some. That tuna kit didn't do much for my breath.
Lincoln::: Here she comes. Play it cool.
Stella::: Hey guys.  Lincoln, do you wanna go to the Burpin' Burger after school?
Lincoln::: Yes! I knew it was me!  I mean, sure, I think I'm free.
Stella::: Great, my family's on a health kick and I'm really craving some fries.  Meet you by the busses.
Zach::: Aw, Lucky!
Liam::: You dog!
Clyde::: Congratulations, buddy.
Rusty::: Ugh, it’s always Lincoln.
Lincoln::: What can I say? I mean, I am having a really good hair week.
Lincoln::: You should have seen her on that claw machine, she was a boss
Zach::: Man! She's cool.
Lincoln::: And get this, we both prefer curly fries to regular, it's like we're meant for each other.
Rusty:::  Well, everyone prefers curly fries.
Clyde:::  Oh! Here she comes.
Zach::: Probably gonna ask about date number two.  Eh? Eh?
Stella::: Hey, Rusty.  Do you wanna go to the flea market with me later?
Rusty:::  Totally, totally.
Stella::: Cool. 
Rusty::: Gah! 
Lincoln:::  What was that, man?! Stella and I have a thing going on!
Rusty::: What do you want me to say?  I guess she decided she prefers red sauce over white sauce. 
Rusty::: ...and then we went out for ice cream and it turns out we both like waffle cones.
Lincoln:::  Well, everyone likes waffle cones
Zach:::  Hey, check it out, Rusty.
Rusty::: Probably wants to lock me down for the whole weekend.
Stella::: Hey, Liam.  You wanna go to the mall after school? I know this sounds weird, but I really like trying on wigs at the wig store.
Liam:::  Don't sound weird to me, I'm in.
Rusty:::  What the heck Liam?
Lincoln:::  Tough break, 'red sauce', I guess she's more into biscuits and gravy now.
Lincoln::: Ugh! I'm so confused, why does Stella keep asking out all of us? What is her deal?
Lisa::: Male sibling lacking melanin, care to join us in viewing the Dream Boat?
Lincoln::: Eh, I'm not really in the mood. 
Kelly::: I'm really torn, they're all great guys, but I'm still not sure who I want to be my first mate. Guess I'll just wait 'til one of them blows me out of the water.
Lincoln:::  Oh, so that's what Stella's doing.  Move over.
Zach:::  Well, well, well, look at you Mr. Date khakis.
Lincoln::: It's laundry day, I couldn't find my jeans.  What about you guys?
Zach::: What? I happened to have a coupon for teeth whitening.
Liam::: And I always wear this much cologne.
Clyde:::  And, I've been meaning to ditch my glasses.
Rusty:::  Okay guys, let's be real, we all watched the Dream Boat last night, we know Stella hasn't decided who she likes and were all trying to 'blow her out of the water'.
Zach::: Well, uh... this is awkward.
Clyde::: It doesn't have to be. We can be gentlemen about this.
Clyde:::  STELLA! 
Liam::: Gah, too bright! 
Rusty::: Yeah!
Lincoln::: Girl Jordan, I'll trade you my pudding for a meatball.  Thanks.  What? You said she likes red sauce.
Rusty::: Low blow, man. This is dry clean only. 
Zach::: In case anyone's interested, I'm out of the snake formation.
Liam::: Well, I actually left it earlier than you. I just didn't tell you.
Rusty::: The snake formation is officially dead.
Clyde::: Fine by me!
Lincoln::: Me too!
Rusty::: That's for the meatball!  Ow!
Zach::: That's for the mustard!  Oof!
Liam::: That's for blinding me!
Clyde:::  Take that!
Nurse Patti::: Now how did this happen? I thought you boys had a snake formation.
Rusty::: Those days are over.
Nurse Patti::: Well, that's a shame. I always thought it was so nice the way you all looked out for each other. 
Lincoln:::  She's right. What are we doing? Are we really gonna throw away our friendship over a girl?
Liam::: Well, that ain't what I want.
Clyde:::  Me neither. You guys are my support circle.
Zach:::  I honestly don't think I can make new friends at this point.
Lincoln::: I can't believe we ever let things get this far.
Rusty::: And the crazy thing is, none of this is even our fault! It's Stella's! For pitting us against each other!
Liam::: I say we go give her the what for right now! Snake formation, fellers?
Lincoln::: Stella, we need to talk to you.
Stella::: Oh, hey guys. What's up?
Clyde:::  Oh, I think you know. We're through with your mind games.  Uh, thanks, Lincoln.
Stella:::  My what?
Liam::: Don't act all innocent. You nearly broke up our friendship.
Rusty::: Asking us all out on dates, then making us compete to see who would 'blow you out of the water'.
Stella::: Blow me out of the water? What are you talking about?
Lincoln::: Doesn't matter. We're done. You couldn't choose one of us for a boyfriend, so now you don't get any of us.
Stella:::  What? I'm sorry for laughing, it's just... you guys are so off base. I don't want a boyfriend, I just wanted to be friends, with all of you.
Zach::: Well, why didn't you just say that in the first place?
Stella::: Uh, you may recall that every time I walked up to you guys as a group, you acted like total weirdos. That's why I was trying to get to know you one on one, or what you call 'dates'.
Boys::: Ah.
Stella::: You know, maybe this was a bad idea. It seems like you guys just can't handle being friends with a girl. I'm gonna go hang out with my lab partner, Mrs. Johnson. 
Lincoln::: Oh, man. We really messed up.
Clyde::: It's too bad 'cause Stella's really fun. I was hoping she'd teach me how to master the claw machine.
Liam::: Yeah, and I was hoping she'd help me pick out a wig for my mee-maw.
Zach::: And she would've made a great addition to our snake formation. She could've been the rattle.
Lincoln::: Well, maybe if we go tell her how sorry we are, she'll give us another chance.
Lincoln::: Hey, Stella.  We just wanna apologize for how we acted.
Liam::: Yeah, you were right. Just cause you're a gal and we're fellers don't mean ya had to be fixin' for a romance.
Rusty::: What we don't know about women, could fill a library.
Lincoln::: We just hope you can forgive us, because we all really liked hanging out with you, as a friend.  Um, okay, well, that's cool. I guess we'll just, uh, see you around.
Stella::: Hang on.  Lincoln, what's in that thermos?
Lincoln::: My dad's homemade tomato soup.
Stella:::  I'll trade you my fruit salad for it.
Lincoln::: Deal! 
Liam::: Hey, uh, how about swapping them there rice cakes for some hush puppies?
Stella::: Definitely.
Zach::: Any chance you'd trade your juice box for a tuna kit?
Stella::: Sorry, dude. That's where I draw the line.
Clyde::: After lunch, we can work out our new snake formation.
Stella::: Just wanna throw it out there: have you guys ever considered a scorpion formation?  It's twenty-two percent more effective.
Boys::: Ooh!
Lincoln::: We're listening.
