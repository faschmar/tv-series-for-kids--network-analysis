Lori::: AAH! DANG IT!
Lincoln:::  Sounds like someone got trapped in the bathroom again.
Lori::: Somebody let me out! Bobby's coming over to study, and I only have three hours to get ready!  THIS HOUSE IS LITERALLY FALLING APART!!!
Lincoln:::  Lori's right. With 11 kids, four pets... and two parents who insist on fixing everything themselves, our house is a bit of a, how do I put this nicely, disaster.
Lincoln:::  You've got the faulty water pressure.​
Lana:::  Eh. I'll go borrow some water from Charles' bowl.
Lola::: Try to have a little digni-
Lincoln:::  And the creaky floorboards.
Lynn Sr::: Lori? Leni? Luan?
Lincoln::: Don't forget about the rotting wood.​
Lynn Sr.::: Luna!
Lincoln::: Then there's the clunky furnace. 
Flashback Lincoln::: Well, Captain. After 13 weeks of careful construction, your ship is finally ready.
Lincoln::: And the crummy TV signal.
Lynn Sr.:::  Something's got me!
Luan::: Wait! Wait! That's perfect!
Loud kids::: Aww.
Lincoln::: And the doorknob situation.
Lisa:::  Dang it.
Leni:::  Dang it.
Lynn:::  Dang it.
Lucy:::  Dang it.
Lori:::  Dang it.
Luna:::  Dang it.
Lincoln:::  Dang it.
Lincoln:::  And I feel like there's something I'm leaving out.  YAH! Right. The mailbox.  Ridiculous. There wasn't even a breeze!
Lisa::: Actually, according to my meteorological instruments, a big storm's a-brewin'. Perhaps a tornado.
Lincoln:::  What? No way!
Patchy::: Patchy Drizzle here with an urgent weather bulletin! A tornado watch has just been issued for the Royal Woods area!
Lisa:::  Try and keep up, Patchy.
Rita::: Alright, kids, everyone down to the basement. Your father and I have to secure the TV antenna.
Twins:::  I'm scared!
Lisa::: Fear not. A tornado watch doesn't mean a twister's coming, but rather that conditions are right for one. Besides, most residential structures can withstand wind speeds of up to 80 miles per hour.
Luan::: Or, in the case of our house, 2 miles per hour! 
Lynn::: Maybe this old heap will blow away, and then we can get a new house!
Lola:::  I'll finally get my castle!
Lori:::  Ugh. I can't believe I have to postpone my study date with Bobby after I did...  ...all this.
Luna::: Dudes! Remember the first time Bobby came over to Casa Loud?
Bobby::: Mr. and Mrs. Loud. Heh. It's an honor to finally meet you. 
Lori:::  Boo-Boo Bear! You're literally bleeding!
Bobby::: Oh.  No worries, babe. It's-it's just marinara sauce. Ahem. Could I please use your restroom?
Lucy::: So, you're Lori's new love interest.
Bobby::: Dang it.
Lori:::  Fortunately, our love was strong enough to overcome any obstacle.  Including creepy sisters who spy on my dates. 
Lucy::: Please. You can't expect to have privacy in this house.
Lucy:::  Sigh.  Sigh.  Sigh.
Lynn::: Okay, you've been doing that for ten minutes. What's wrong, Luce?
Lucy:::  Don't tell anyone, but...  ...I've been reading this new book series about a werewolf, and it feels like I'm cheating on Edwin. 
Lola:::  I'd stick with the vampire. Werewolves are hairy and gross. Yech!
Lana::: Which is exactly why she should go for one! 
Lori:::  But Edwin was her first love!
Rita::: Of course not, dear. When I was a girl, I read a series about a cute lumberjack.
Lucy::: Groan.
Lucy:::  Sigh...
Lisa::: I still fail to grasp your dilemma, as both would-be suitors are mythological beings.
Lucy::: My point was that our walls are ridiculously thin.
Leni::: Yeah! Not to mention leaky!
Leni::: Uh-oh.
Leni::: Got it.  Dang it!
Leni::: And it wasn't even raining! Someone just flushed the upstairs toilet!
Luan::: Urine trouble then!  Get it?  Aw, come on. It was funny!
Lisa::: Good news. Wind speeds have decreased significantly. We should be out of this asbestos-ridden dungeon soon.
Lori::: At least it's not flooding like it did in the last big storm.
Lisa::: I'll get the buckets.
Lori::: Last one.
Lynn::: Wait. But don't you guys remember what happened next?
Lynn::: Hey, guys! Check it out!
Lynn::: CANNONBALL!!! 
Lori::: Ew! I'm not swimming in grody basement water!
Lynn::: Hey, Lori! I found your missing earring! 
Lori:::  The one from Bobby? CANNONBALL! 
Lynn::: Yeah, I guess sometimes, living in a crummy house isn't all bad.
Lincoln::: Yeah, like the time possums got in through the holes in the roof and chewed up the wiring.
Rita::: Sorry, kids. Till we get new cables, there's gonna be no TV or internet.
Lynn Sr.::: Whoa whoa whoa! No need to panic. I think I know how to possum the time. Ha-ha!  Guess what ol' Dad found?
Lori:::  A wireless hotspot?
Luan::: Ow!
Lisa:::  Fret not, lassie. One drop of my mugwump elixir will soothe every ache and pain.
Lori::: That did turn out to be fun.
Lisa::: Yes, indeed.
Lynn::: That was pretty cool.
Lola::: That was almost as fun as the time the air conditioner went crazy, and Dad couldn't turn it off.
Luna::: You know, dudes, maybe we've been too hard on the ol' crib. It's got some perks. Like the wicked slanty floors.
Luna:::  Yo, Lans! Pass the gravy.
Luna:::  You never have to get up to grab some grub!
Lynn::: Or a fresh roll of TP.
Lynn::: GUYS! I NEED A RELOAD!  And she makes the snag.
Lincoln::: The broken doorbell can come in handy, too.
Lincoln::: I can't remember the last time we paid for pizza.
Lynn::: You know what else comes in handy? That hole in the bathroom floor.
Lori::: Um, we got it, Lynn.
Lynn::: Oh. Okay. Just wanted to be sure.
Luan::: Guys, I think Lily wants to share a house story, too. Mind if I translate, Lilster?
Lily::: Poo-poo. Ahem. 
Luan::: So, it was Mom and Dad's anniversary weekend.
Kids::: BYE! HAVE FUN!
Lincoln::: Okay, guys, it's time to put Operation Paint The Peeling House To Give Mom And Dad The Greatest Anniversary Gift Ever And Also Think Of A Shorter Name For This Operation...into action!
Lucy::: I still think adjacent burial plots would have been a better gift. Nothing says romance like eternity.
Lincoln::: They're back! Paintbrushes down!
Loud Kids::: SURPRISE! HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!
Lynn Sr. and Rita:::  Good...gravy...
Lincoln::: So, you like it?
Lynn Sr. and Rita::: Uh...
Luan::: That was a great story, Lily.
Lily::: Poo-poo.
Luan::: I think she's got another story!  Oh. This time, it really is just poo-poo.
Lori:::  What's going on? Is the storm over? 
Lisa::: Uh. Actually, wind speeds have increased significantly. Meaning the tornado watch is about to become a tornado warning.  And there it is.
Lynn Sr::: NOBODY PANIC!
Lynn:::  I guess it's not such a bad house after all.
Lisa::: Definitely.
Lana::: I don't want our house to blow away!
Lynn::: Me neither.
Lisa::: I take back what I said before.
Luan::: Yeah, we have so many memories in these walls.
Luna::: I'm sorry I ever ragged on this place.
Lynn::: Me too.
Leni::: We're so sorry, house!
Lola::: Me too!
Lana::: Me three!
Lincoln:::  You might be old and creaky and full of leaks, but you're ours. And we love you!
Lisa::: All clear!
Lincoln::: Let's go check on the house!  I hope the house is okay!
Lynn:::  I'll check the hole in the bathroom floor.
Bicyclist::: Yikes. You guys were hit hard.
Lincoln::: Nope, this is how our house always looks. And we wouldn't want it any other way.
Lynn Sr.::: All right, everyone, back inside.
Loud Family::: Dang it!
