Lincoln & Clyde::: Ahh!  
Lincoln::: It's like that zombie was coming right at us.
Clyde::: I know, that's the 2160p LED touch screen.
Lincoln:::  Can I give it a try?
Clyde:::  Ye-yeah, sure.
Lincoln::: Wow, feels like it was built for me.
Clyde::: That's the memory foam handle grips. They conform to each individual gamer's hand.  Whoops, little grease spot. 
Lincoln::: I can't believe you got a Super Snap 95. They've been sold out for weeks. 
Clyde::: Yeah, my Nana Gayle won it at bingo, though she thought it was a postage scale.
Snap::: Game over.
Clyde::: Well, game over. 
Lincoln::: Mind if I play again?
Clyde::: Oh, sure. I was gonna suggest putting it back in its case, and admiring it from afar, butâ€¦ go ahead?
Lincoln:::  Guess you've got your weekend all mapped out.
Clyde::: Well, actually, I can only play with this until 11:59 PM. Tomorrow is Screen-Free Sunday, it's a new McBride house rule. My dads think we need one day a week to completely unplug.
Lincoln::: I guess that fits right in with your Meatless Mondays and Wheat-less Wednesdays.
Snap::: Game over.
Lincoln::: Dang it.  You know, Clyde, since you have to unplug tomorrow, maybe I could borrow the Snap.
Clyde::: Uh, you mean, like at your house?
Lincoln:::  As long as you're cool with it.
Lana::: Is that the Snap?
Lola::: Gimme, gimme, gimme that Snap!
Snap::: Game over. 
Clyde's Thoughts::: Okay, Clyde, you know you're not comfortable with this, just tell him the truth. You don't want him to borrow it.
Clyde:::  Of course you can borrow it! I'll bring it over tomorrow.
Lincoln::: Thanks, buddy.
Clyde's Thoughts::: Dang it, Clyde! What was that?!
Lincoln:::  You know what, Clyde?
Clyde::: You changed your mind about borrowing the console? No worries, these things happen. 
Lincoln:::  No, I probably don't say this enough, but I'm really lucky to have a best friend who's so cool about sharing his stuff.
Snap::: Game over.
Clyde:::  That's me. Mr. Very Cool About Sharing His Stuff. 
Clyde::: This is ridiculous. You have to talk to Lincoln.  Just let him know he's a good guy, no, no. Best guy. And you like him. No, you love him, but you can't let him borrow your Snap.  What are you, nuts? If you tell him he can't borrow it, it'll be the end of your friendship! You'll be destined to walk through life alone, and end up like one of those people who only talk to their cats!  Oh no, it's happening already!  Okay, I have to lend him the Snap, but I need a plan to keep it safe.  I know, I'll just spend the day at Lincoln's house. That way I can protect the console, and my friendship.
Lincoln:::  Hey pal. Thanks for loaning me the Snap. Uh, where is it?
Clyde::: In this briefcase.
Lincoln::: Thanks, buddy, I'd ask you to join me but, I know you're not supposed to be playing today. I'll have it back to you first thing tomorrow.
Clyde::: Actually, I'd love to get off my feet for a second, my orthotics are worn down and I got blisters from walking over.
Lincoln::: But, you rode your bike over.
Clyde::: Right, did I say blisters? I meant pedal warts.
Lincoln::: Oh, well, come on in, bud.
Clyde:::  Man, this foot is killing me, would you mind grabbing me some ice?
Lincoln::: Anything for the guy who loaned me his Snap.  Clyde, why are you on my desk?
Clyde::: Uh, there was a draft, and I wouldn't want you getting a cold.
Lincoln::: And your foot?
Clyde::: It's a miracle! My foot is feeling much better.
Lincoln::: Great. Well, I'll walk you out.
Clyde::: Uh, actually, can I have a sip of this? I'm showing the classic signs of dehydration, dry mouth, dull headache, decreased urine output.  Oh, man! Would you look at that? Mind if I wash this before I leave? I don't want the stain to set.
Lincoln::: Uh, sure. I'd lend you a clean shirt, but I haven't done my laundry, so...
Clyde::: I'll do it! I mean, I'm already doing mine.
Clyde::: All done.
Lincoln::: Wow, thanks for doing all of our laundry,  guess you'll wanna be heading out now.
Clyde:::  Uh, uh, uh... I've never noticed how thin this blanket on your bed is, you must be freezing at night.
Lincoln::: Well, actually-
Clyde::: Say no more, I'll knit you a new one.
Clyde::: Not today, Clifford.
Lincoln::: Bathroom break.
Clyde::: With the Snap?
Lincoln::: Ahh!  Clyde! What the heck are you doing?!
Clyde::: Uh...  Thought I'd grab a shower while you, you know, do your business. Bathroom buds!
Lincoln::: Okay, Clyde, I know what's going on here.
Clyde:::   Y-you do?
Lincoln::: It's obvious. The hovering, the laundry, the blanket, your foot. You're just dying to break Screen-Free Sunday and play with the Snap.
Clyde::: Well, actually-  Uh, you're right, that's exactly what's going on.
Lincoln::: I know you pretty well, Clyde. Luckily, I have a surefire way to save you from temptation.  This is for your own good, buddy!
Clyde:::  Oh no, what have I done? My Snap is history.  Okay, okay, don't spiral, Clyde. Maybe it'll be fine. Lincoln hasn't done anything that bad with it yet, and as long as it stays in his room- 
Lola::: Lincoln, you almost spilled my nail polish!
Clyde::: NOOOO!  Hey Dad, uh, Lincoln invited me to stay over for dinner, so I'm gonna be here a bit longer.  Yes, I have my antacid. 
Leni:::  And then Becky was like 'I don't know if I even wanna go anymore' and-
Lynn:::  Loud crosses the blue line,  throws a deke on the defender,  winds up for the slap shot,  she shoots, she-  Denied?! What the heck?
Lily::: Inkin, Inkin.  Ah, Cad!
Clyde::: Shh.
Lincoln:::  Huh?
Leni:::  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  No. No... way!  Uh-huh.  No... dang... tootin'... way!  Lincoln! Stop drinking my kale juice.
Lisa:::  Biology, geology, I don't make no apology. 
Lisa::: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Clyde:::  I'll apologize to Lisa later.
Lynn Sr.:::  Da-da-da, doo-doot-doo-doot, making dough, throw it high, never low, throw it high.  Watch closely, son, the key to a good pizza crust is loft. You can't be afraid to give it a good --toss!  Okay, maybe a bit too much loft.  Hands off that pizza, Grouse!
Lynn Sr.::: Kids, dinner!
Clyde::: Oh no.  Okay, Clyde, just ride this out until everyone is done eating.  Actually, this isn't so bad, it's kind of cozy under here.
Lynn:::  Whew! My compliments to the chef.
Lana:::  Oh, oh hey Charles,  who's a good boy?  Want a snackie? Go on Charles, eat it.
Clyde:::  Charles, no, no, no, I don't even like sausage.  Here, you can have it.
Lana::: Charles, why are you so mad?  Clyde? Why are you under the table?
Leni:::  Lincoln, you invite your friend at dinner, and you don't even give him a chair? That's rude!
Lincoln::: I didn't invite him.
Lola::: That's even ruder, clearly he's hungry.
Lincoln::: Uh, Clyde, what's going on?
Clyde::: Lincoln, can I talk to you for a sec? In private.
Lincoln::: What's up, Clyde?
Clyde::: Well, I've been following you around all day, because I was worried about the Snap, I never wanted to let you borrow it in the first place.
Lola:::  Ooh, drama.
Lynn:::  Fight! Fight! Fight!
Lincoln:::  Would you guys grow up!?
Lisa::: Says the guy having a confab under the dining room table.
Lincoln::: Come on, Clyde.
Lincoln::: So why didn't you want me to borrow the Snap?
Clyde::: I was afraid something was gonna happen to it, I'm pretty particular about my stuff, and you're um, a little, less particular, and then you throw in your ten sisters and-
Lincoln::: Clyde, if that's how you felt, why didn't you just tell me?
Clyde::: I was afraid you'd be hurt, and our friendship would be over, and I'd be destined to walk through life alone and become one of those people who only talk to cats.  Gah, it's happening again!
Lincoln:::  Clyde, that's ridiculous. I might have been a little hurt at first, but, I would've understood, I know I'm not as careful with my stuff as you are, no one is.
Clyde::: Fair point, so, we're still friends?
Lincoln::: Of course we are.
Clyde::: Thanks for understanding. I promise to be more honest in the future, and you've given me a lot to talk about on therapy Thursday.
Lincoln:::  Here's your Snap back.
Clyde::: Thanks, buddy. Well, I should probably get home.
Lynn Sr.::: Here you go, Clyde, take some deconstructed pizza for the road.
Lincoln:::  Dad! Watch out!  NOOOO!
Clyde::: Lincoln, are you okay?
Lincoln::: Yeah, I'm good.  Uh-oh, got a little sauce on there.
Clyde::: Eh, it's nothing, thanks for the save buddy,  Alright, see you later. 
Lincoln::: Take it easy, Clyde. 
Clyde:::  Dad, I'm on my way home, I'm gonna need a lint-free cloth, and some white vinegar.  Meet me at the front door.
