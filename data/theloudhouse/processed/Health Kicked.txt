Announcer::: You've been steamed!
Lincoln::: Yes! We beat Punky Prawn! You wanna go for Mad Cod?
Clyde::: I can't. I need to get home to help my dads. They're training for the Royal Woods Ultra Extreme Ninja Competition.
Lincoln::: What's that?
Clyde:::  It's the ultimate athletic course, challenging the limits of both human endurance and spandex.
Lincoln::: Wow. I didn't know your dads were so into fitness.
Clyde::: Well, they just started to be. They say they want to be around a long time to watch me grow up.
Clyde::: Oh! There they are now!
Clyde::: Okay, Dads, let's beat your time home!
Lincoln::: Hey, guys, you, uh, wanna go for a walk? It's a beautiful day out.
Rita::: No thanks, sweetie. We are nice and comfy right here.
Rita and Lynn Sr.:::  DIBS NOT! 
Rita::: Have a nice walk, Lincoln. 
Lincoln::: So, as you can see from these images, Mom and Dad are seriously out of shape. Lisa?
Lisa::: I concur. I've run some tests and concluded that our parental units have the urine of 80-year-olds.  Moving onto the results of my fecal study-
Leni::: What's a fecal study?
Lincoln::: If we want Mom and Dad to be around long enough to watch us grow up, we need to get them exercising.
Lincoln::: Okay then, Operation Get Mom And Dad Out Of The House And Into Shape is a go!
Leni::: Uh, question. What kind of shape? A triangle, or more like a circle thingy?
Rita::: Oh, it's sweet of you to be concerned, kids, but your father and I don't need exercise. We're in perfectly good shape. You ready, honey?
Lynn Sr.:::  Give me a minute. That took a lot out of me.
Rita::: I'll go start the car.  Oh, dang it. 
Lincoln::: Oh, come on, you guys! Look at yourselves!
Lynn Sr.::: We would, son, but the mirror's all the way upstairs.  Oh. Okay, now I see your point.
Lynn::: My favorite exercise is rock climbing. It's a great way to get in shape and a total head rush.  Hoo! Let's do this!
Lynn:::  Lynn Loud! Lynn Loud! Lynn Loud! Lynn Loud! Yeah!  Come on, guys! Engage your core!
Lynn Sr.:::  Are we in shape yet?
Lana::: My favorite way to stay fit is mud wrestling!
Rita:::  W-w-wait. What?
Lana::: Take down, two points!  Your turn, Dad!
Lincoln::: I think we might need to take it down a notch.
Lisa::: You'll find the ancient art of Tai Chi a more approachable way to exercise. This posture is called Calming the Waters of the Heart.
Lynn Sr.::: Wow. I'm really feeling it. Honey, are you feeling all this? Whoa, man, I am centered! I am one with the universe! I am so-
Lisa::: Did I mention that Tai Chi is both ancient and silent?
Leni:::  Ah. Remember to breathe. Keep your knees bent, and really use those triceps.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, yeah. I'm feeling the burn!
Lola and Lana::: Rita Loud, jumped on a cloud! All her kids were super proud! How many cheers did Rita get? One, two, three...
Luna::: You ready to Luna-cise, dudes? Just follow me. One, two, three, four!  Head bang!  Windmill!  Air splits! 
Lynn Sr.:::  Yeah! Ha ha!
Luna::: Great form, Dad. But next time, wait for me to say guitar smash.
Lori::: So, Whitney was like I don't think highlights are right for you and I was like, Ugh. I already bought the lemon juice, and so she goes-
Rita:::  I don't know how you can jog and talk so much, sweetie.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, the ice cream truck! 
Lori::: Dad, no!
Lana::: I got this! 
Lynn Sr.::: Oof!
Lana::: Take down, two points!
Rita:::  You kids were right about exercising. I feel fantastic!
Lynn Sr.::: Me too! In fact, I say we do this every morning! Race you around the block, honey!  Eat my dust!
Rita:::  Oh, you're on!
Lincoln::: Well, guys, looks like our work here is done.
Lynn Sr.::: Kids, we had such a great time exercising yesterday, we thought why not do more?
Lola:::  You disrupted my beauty sleep to tell us that?
Rita::: No, no, no. All of us. It was so sweet of you kids to think about our health, we realized we should be thinking about yours too.
Lynn Sr.:::  Louds, fall in!
Loud Kids::: ICE CREAM!!!
Lynn Sr.::: Whoo! Really got the blood pumping today.
Rita:::  Don't forget to stay hydrated.
Lynn Sr.:::  It's onion-infused water; for better bladder function.
Lynn:::  Ugh. Well, it tastes like B.O.
Lana:::  I'll say!  Ah.
Lynn Sr.::: You kids must be famished. It's grub time!
Kids:::  Pizza and fries!. Burgers with cheese!
Lucy::: Blood oranges.
Lynn Sr.::: No, I mean actual grubs. 
Kids minus Lana::: Eww!
Lana::: Ooh.
Rita::: They're rich in protein and low in carbohydrates. So eat up. You'll need your energy for tomorrow.
Lynn Sr.:::  That's right. We've got a 6:00 AM lake swim, followed by hot yoga, followed by 200 squat thrusts.
Lana:::  Hey, these are great with a little of this B.O. water. 
Lisa:::  This marks seven straight days of agonizing musculoskeletal torture; street name: exercise.
Lola::: This is all your fault!  I'm talking to you, Lincoln. I just can't lift my arm to point.
Luna::: Yeah. You got the 'rents on this health kick, bro. You need to get 'em off of it.
Lynn Sr.:::  Woo-hoo! Honey, check it out!  I fit into my old leather pants!  Oops. And by fit, I mean I still have a ways to go. But now I have a new goal.
Rita::: Ooh! Mine will be to fit into that tankini I bought on our honeymoon. 
Lynn Sr.:::  Va-va-voom!
Lincoln::: Wait! That gives me an idea. Maybe if Mom and Dad think they've reached all their fitness goals, they'll cool it with the exercising. Okay, huddle up.
Lincoln:::  First, we gotta make Mom and Dad believe they've lost weight. So, Lisa, you'll rig the scale.
Lincoln::: And Lori and Leni, you'll replace their clothes with larger sizes.
Lynn Sr.::: Gollers! And these are my skinny jeans!
Lincoln::: Next, we have to convince Mom and Dad they've gotten stronger. Lynn and Lana, you'll paint higher numbers on the weights.
Lincoln::: While Luan and Luna loosen all the jars in the kitchen.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh! Hey!  Guess I don't know my own strength.
Lincoln::: Lastly, to make Mom and Dad think they're getting faster, Lucy, you'll turn the clocks back.
Rita::: Whoo!  We ran five miles in ten minutes!
Rita::: Kids, dinner!
Lynn:::  No grubs and onion water?
Parents:::  Not tonight!
Rita::: Your father and I are celebrating the great progress we've made.
Lynn Sr.::: Yeah. Check out these guns.  Bang, bang!
Rita::: We've got another surprise for you. No exercise tomorrow; you can all sleep late.
Lucy:::  Oh, real food, how I've missed you.
Lynn Sr.::: Whoa, whoa, easy, guys. I don't want anyone to lose a finger.
Lori::: I'm so glad the exercise nightmare is over.
Leni:::  Now we just have the tankini and leather pants nightmare.
Luan::: I gotta hand it to you, Lincoln, your idea really worked.
Lincoln::: That's why they call me the man with the plan.  Huh? Hey, look. A note from Mom and Dad.  Dear kids, since we're now in such great shape, we decided to enter the Royal Woods Ultimate Extreme Ninja Competition. See you tonight with our trophies?
Lisa:::  Pssh. Man with the plan indeed.
Lynn:::  There's no way they're ready for that competition. Just imagine what would happen to them!
Lincoln::: We gotta stop them!
Parents::: HELP!!!
Lori::: Hang on, Mom and Dad! We're coming!
Rita::: Kids, what are you doing here?
Leni::: We came to rescue you.
Lincoln::: Yeah. This is all our fault. We tricked you into thinking you were in better shape than you really are.
Lola::: That way you'd stop torturing us with exercise.
Luan::: Yeah, you probably want to exercise your right to punish us.  Get it? But, um, seriously, are you gonna punish us?
Rita::: No, we're not gonna punish you.
Lynn Sr.::: But why did you try to trick us into exercising?
Lincoln::: We just want you guys to be healthy so you'll be around long enough to watch us grow up.
Parents:::  Aw...
Lisa:::  Uh, I hate to break up the moment, but...I don't think this bar can support-
Lincoln::: Now this is my kind of exercise.
Lynn Sr.:::  Come on, Louds! Pick up the pace!
Rita::: Honey, I thought we agreed to take it easier.
Lynn Sr.::: But the ice cream truck is getting away!
Loud Family:::  ICE CREAM!!!
