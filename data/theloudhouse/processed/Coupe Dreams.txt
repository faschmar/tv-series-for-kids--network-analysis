Lynn Sr.::: I can't believe our little Lori Lou is buying her very own car for college!  It seems like just yesterday you were tootling around on your trike, diaper filled in the brim... 
Lori::: Aw Dad, stop. Seriously people are looking. 
Rita::: Now remember sweetie, all you need is something sensible that will get you back in forth from school.
Lynn Sr.:::  Cause you're coming home every weekend, right?
Lori:::  OMGosh!  That is literally the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen!
Leni:::  He's cute, but, he's kind of a weird dancer. 
Lori:::  No, not that.  That!
Leni::: This car is beautiful! And it's totes your color.
Lori and Leni::: Woah.
Leni::: Whoa.
Leni::: Ooh!
Lori::: Cool!
Lori and Leni::: Ahh...
Lori::: I can put my iced chai here, my golf clubs in the back... It's like this car was made for me!
Leni::: Can you imagine pulling up to Fairway University in this?
Valet:::  That ride is so nice I'll park it for free!
Rita::: Guh!
Lynn Sr.::: Yikes, that's a lot of moolah. The entire family could go to Fiji for the same price.
Rita::: This car is beautiful, but are you sure you don't want something closer to your price range?
Lori::: No! This is my dream car. I have to have it, I'll find a way to buy it.
Lori::: Oh, and we got to think of a good name for her.
Leni:::  How about, Lydia?
Lori::: Love it!  I still can't believe I'm gonna buy my first car.
Mr. Grouse::: Hey Loud, if you need a car I got an old clunker that I'd love to get rid of for the right price.  Hmm?!
Lori::: Thanks for the offer, Mr. Grouse, but I've already found my dream car.  I know the car's expensive, but I already figured out how to pay for it. I'll just get a second job on top of working at Dad's restaurant.
Leni::: That's a great plan, Lori.  Oh-no! Mr. Grouse, your car!
Mr. Grouse::: Huh?  There it goes. 
Lynn::: That's so sick!
Luna::: Rad, dude!
Lola::: I need one of those for my room.
Lori::: Tada! You are looking at Royal Rides' newest shuttle driver. Check this out.  ðŸŽµ We thank you for your loyalty, we'll treat you just like royalty. ðŸŽµ
Lynn::: Ugh...
Luna::: Kosh, off-key.
Leni::: So perfesh.
Lori:::  And this, will track all the money I'll be making toward my new car.
Shuttle App:::  Customer pickup at the Royal Woods Mall.
Lori:::  My very first customer.
Leni::: Okay bye!
Lynn Sr.:::  Where's Vanzilla? I got band practice with K-Dawg!
Lynn::: I got you, Pops.
Lynn Sr.::: Argh!
Lori::: Hey, Scoots.  Oops, one sec.  ðŸŽµ We thank you for your loyalty- ðŸŽµ
Scoots::: I don't got time for your nursery rhymes. Step on it, blondie!
Lori::: Huh?
Scoots::: We got the fuzz on us. Lose him!
Lori::: Please tell me you bought that pudding machine.
Scoots:::  JUST DRIVE!
Luan::: Step on it, you nose we got a gig.
Shuttle App::: Customer pickup at the Royal Woods Cemetery.
Lori:::  Ugh... the cemetery? Well, more money for my new car I guess.  Oh, don't worry, I'll drop you guys off at your party gig after.
Dinky:::  Hi, I'm Dinky. 
Persephone::: Greetings, Dinky.
Lori::: Come on, guys. Just try to get along. It's a short ride.
Boris:::  Clowns terrify Boris.
Lori::: Hi, Liam. Hi, Liam's mee-maw. Do you guys have any luggage?
Liam::: Nope, but Virginia, Clarence and Carol Anne sure do.  Okay, everybody in, teeth and talons to yourselves.
Lori::: Dah! Turkey!
Liam::: Oh, don't mind Clarence. He's just sad vacation's over.
Leni::: Hey, how did your first day go? Did you rake it in?
Lori::: I don't know, let's see.  Thirty dollars?! Royal Rides must take a huge cut of my earnings.
Leni::: At this rate, it'll take you millions of years to save enough money. I think. I'd have to have Lisa check my math.
Lori::: Ohh...  No, I've got to have that car now.  Ah! I know, I'm just going to have to pick up a few more jobs.
Lincoln::: Whoa... Hey, what's all that stuff?
Lori::: Well, in addition to being a shuttle driver, I'm also delivering food and doing mobile babysitting.
Leni:::  You get to babysit people's phones? Fun.
Lori::: No, Leni, you babysit kids, in the car.
Food Delivery App::: Food pickup at Burpin' Burger.
Lori::: Time for my first food delivery. Wish me luck. 
Leni::: Bye Lori. See you later.
Lana::: See you later.
Lynn Sr.:::  Where's Vanzilla?  I need baking powder.  And a fire extinguisher!
Lola:::  On it.
Mobile Babysitting App::: Babysitter needed, at Charles Street and Oakhurst Drive.
Lori:::  Have a great time at the zombie escape room, Mr. & Mrs. Fox. I'll drop the kids off later. Okay, I just need to deliver the burger thenâ€¦  Guys! Get down from there!
Lynn:::  Lori, hurry up! What are we paying you for?!
Food Delivery App::: Food pickup at Gus' Games and Grub.  Let's go.
Lynn:::  Wait, you're getting that? What about us?
Lori::: Don't worry. I'll drop you guys off after. It'll be super quick.
Lynn::: Oh, it better be. I need to get in at least two hours of bicep curls before the game. Gotta get these babies in prime condition.
Man::: Ah, finally! I got a house full of hangry party guests to feed.  Hey! Half of these pizzas are gone! Your boss is gonna hear about this!
Lori:::  I am so sorry. I'll make sure you get a full refund.
Lynn:::  What the heck? There's a turkey in here!
Flip:::  Oh great, you're my driver. I seem to recall you running me over once.  Hey, don't forget my goods.
Lori:::  Seriously, Flip?
Flip::: You want a tip, you gotta earn it.  Holy nachos. You can kiss your five stars goodbye.  And your upholstery.
Mrs. Gurdle::: I'm so glad that you're doing mobile mani-pedis now. So convenient.
Seymour::: Not for us. How long's this gonna take?
Lori::: And done. Okay, now hold your feet by the vent.
Cheryl::: Uh, well, I ordered a gravy and cornbread poke bowl. But you're just cute as a button.
Lori:::  ðŸŽµ We thank you for your loyalty, we'll treat you just like ro- ðŸŽµ Ow!
Punk Girl::: Hmm. No sign. This punk club must be super underground.
Woman:::  What? Who are you? Where are my children?!
Bouncer::: You guys got ID?  Right this way.
Leni::: Lori what's wrong?
Lori::: I was literally fired from every one of my new jobs. And the worst part is after all of that hard work I only have five hundred dollars to show for it.  Now there's no way I'll be able to buy my dream car.  Maybe I should have been more realistic.
Leni:::  Well, five hundred dollars isn't nothing. You could buy half a car. Or take the bus five times. I think. I'd have to have Lisa check my math.
Mr. Grouse::: Well here she is.
Lori::: Mr. Grouse, this literally has so much cute potential.
Mr. Grouse::: Don't look so surprised. How do you think I got Mrs. G to go out with me back in the day? 
Leni::: OMGosh, I thought of a name for your car. She's totally, Eliza.
Lori:::  Love it! Do you think Lana would fix it up for me?
Lana:::  A three-sixty cubic inch V8, two-hundred and twenty-five horses with four on the floor.  Oh yeah. I can have this baby running in no time.  Ooh, an opossum! I'll take that as payment. 
Mr. Grouse::: Hey, Loud, you want the car or what? I'm missing my judge shows for this.
Lori::: How much are you asking for it?
Mr. Grouse::: I'll take seven-hundred and fifty dollars. But I ain't going any lower than that.
Lori:::  All I have is five hundred.
Mr. Grouse:::  Hmm. Maybe we can work something out.
Lori::: So, where would you like me to drive you now, Mr. Grouse?
Mr. Grouse::: Ah, take me to the barbershop. I need to get my 'stache trimmed. Then we'll head up the bingo hall and after that the bowling alley.  Nothing like having a personal driver.  Where'd you learn how to drive? The internet? And crank up the AC! Sweatin' like a bull in Orlando here. And do something about that sun, it's right in my eyes! How much longer? I need to use the little Grouse's room.
Lori:::  It's just till the end of the summer.
