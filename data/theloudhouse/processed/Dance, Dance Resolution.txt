Rusty::: Oh, here they come! These ladies are definitely gonna ask us.
Liam::: Man, we're never gonna get dates.
Zach::: Ah, I can't believe we're going stag to our first Sadie Hawkins Dance.
Lincoln:::  Don't give up hope, guys. And can someone pass the ketchup?
Rusty::: Why are you guys under the table?
Lincoln::: I'm hiding from Ronnie Anne so she can't ask me to the dance.
Clyde::: And I'm here for moral support.
Rusty::: Lincoln, I thought you liked Ronnie Anne.
Lincoln::: I do, but there's a two-for-one deal at the arcade tonight, and there's no way I'm missing it.
Lincoln::: GAH! Here she comes. Remember, I'm not down here!
Ronnie Anne::: Hey, guys. Have you seen Lincoln?
Boys::: Uh...
Zach::: Nope.
Liam::: Lincoln? Uh, never done heard of him.
Rusty::: He's definitely not under the table.
Lincoln::: Oof!
Lincoln::: YAH!
Leni::: So? Did Ronnie Anne ask you to the Sadie Hawkins Dance?
Lincoln:::  Uh, yee, uh, um...
Lori:::  I bet she was so excited. The Sadie Hawkins is literally the most important dance in a girl's life.
Lincoln:::  Well, actually, Ronnie Anne didn't even ask me.
Sisters:::  WHAT?!
Lincoln::: Yeah. I waited around all day, but it just never happened.
Lucy::: Poor big brother. You must be devastated.
Lincoln::: Oh, you know, I'll get through it somehow.
Lincoln:::  What? I-I would have told them the truth, but believe me, they wouldn't have understood. Sometimes a little white lie works out better for everyone.
Lincoln::: Mom, I'm going to the arcade with Clyde! I'll see you later! 
Luan::: Hey, Lincoln, you got a sec?
Lucy::: Hey, I need to talk to him first.
Luna::: No! Dudes, urgent!  Mine is more important! Guess what, bro? I hooked ya up with a date for the dance!
Lincoln::: What?!
Luan::: Hey, so did I!
Lucy::: So did I.
Lynn::: Me too!
Lincoln::: W-w-why?
Lynn::: You were so bummed out when Ronnie Anne didn't ask you. I just wanted to make you feel better.
Luna::: Me too.
Luan::: So did I.
Lucy::: Me too.
Lincoln::: You guys, I wasn't bummed out! I didn't want her to ask me because I wanted to go to the arcade tonight.
Luan:::  Then why didn't you say so, ya yutz?
Lincoln::: 'Cause you made me feel so guilty. All that stuff about the most important dance in a girl's life.
Luna:::  Well, you're going to the dance now, dude, 'cause my friend'll be wicked bummed if you flake on her!
Lynn::: Mine too.
Lucy::: Ditto.
Luan:::  Yeah! Snow-one likes a flake!  But seriously, you're going.
Lincoln::: But, you guys, how am I supposed to juggle four dates?
Luna:::  That's not our problem, dude.
Luan::: You dug your own grave, Lincoln.
Lynn::: Now you gotta lie in it.
Lucy::: <span style=font-weight:normal;> </span>Lucky.
Mrs. Johnson::: And here's your raffle ticket.
Lincoln::: Ooh! There's a raffle?
Mrs. Johnson::: Yep. The winner gets to have lunch with me in the teachers' lounge.
Clyde::: Good news, Lincoln. I've checked the entire gym, and Ronnie Anne is nowhere to be found.
Lincoln::: Oh, that's a relief. I can't let Ronnie Anne see me here after I've avoided her all day. It'll really hurt her feelings. Besides, I have enough on my hands juggling four dates.
Clyde::: Don't worry. I've got everything we need to make the night go smoothly: binoculars, stopwatch, dossiers on each of the lovely ladies, and, lastly, a hidden microphone and a receiver.  I'll be your eyes in the sky. Now, let's move out!
Lincoln::: Hey, guys. Did you get dates?
Liam::: Nah. We're just here for the raffle. I've always wanted to see the teachers' lounge.
Clyde:::  Lincoln, I'm in position.  I forgot I'm afraid of heights, but I'll be okay.
Lincoln:::  You're a true pal, Clyde.
Clyde::: Don't mention it.  Now, at your 11 o'clock, you'll see a girl with purple streaks in her hair. That's Luna's friend, Tabby. She loves sweatin' to the oldies, turning it up to 11, and her ideal date is soundproofing a wall with egg crates.
Lincoln::: Hi, Tabby. I'm Lincoln.
Tabby:::  Good to meet ya! Wanna jam?
Lincoln::: Oh, uh...okay. 
Tabby::: Rockin' air piano! You got some chops.
Clyde:::  Sky Guy to the Ladies' Man, your time is up. Move onto Girl No. 2.
Lincoln::: Ooh, sorry, Tabby. My piano elbow's acting up. Gonna grab an ice pack. 
Clyde:::  Okay, at your 6 o'clock is Luan's friend from Clown School, Giggles. A Virgo with an infectious laugh, Giggles' ideal date is trying to figure out how many people she can cram into one car.
Lincoln:::  Hey, Giggles. I'm Lincoln.
Giggles::: Pleased to meet ya!  I heard a lot of buzz about you! 
Lincoln::: Good one. You got something on your shirt.  Boop!
Giggles:::  Touch√©!
Clyde:::  Wrap it up, Ladies' Man. Girl No. 3 is waiting. Lucy's friend, Haiku, is an up and coming poet. Her dislikes include kittens, sunlight, and people who smile too much.
Haiku::: Hi, Lincoln. Wanna hear my poem? Empty, lonely, dark. The universe is weeping. I have no tissues. Okay, your turn.
Lincoln::: Uh...Jack and Jill went up a hill to fetch a pail of water.
Haiku::: Oh, yes. The futility of teamwork. Deep stuff.
Clyde:::  Time's up, Ladies' Man. Girl No. 4 is Lynn's roller derby teammate, Polly Pain. I think she's over by the-
Lincoln:::  I found her, Clyde...
Polly::: Nailed ya, bro! In roller derby, that's a move I like to call the Booty Block!  And this is the Helicopter! 
Lincoln::: Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
Polly::: Wow! You didn't even barf! I'm impressed.
Lincoln:::  Thanks...
Clyde:::  That's time, Ladies' Man. Get ready for round two!
Clyde:::  So...high...up...
Lincoln::: AAAHH!!! 
Lincoln:::  How ya feelin', Sky Guy?
Clyde::: Better. I think I'm ready to go back up.
Lincoln::: No way, Clyde. You've done enough. Thanks to your help, I've got everything under control.  GAH! RONNIE ANNE!
Lincoln::: Clyde, what am I gonna do? Ronnie Anne is here!
Clyde::: Well, you can't stay under here. You're already 30 seconds late for air harmonica with Tabby.
Lincoln:::  I've got an idea.  Psst! Guys! 
Rusty::: Hey! What the heck, Lincoln?
Lincoln::: Get over here.
Zach::: You two sure like to hide under tables, don't you?
Lincoln::: How would you guys like someone to dance with?
Rusty::: Sorry, Lincoln. You're not my type.
Lincoln::: Not with me, with girls!
Rusty, Zach, and Liam:::  GIRLS?!
Rusty::: On second thought, I think I'd rather dance with you.
Clyde::: Come on, guys. It's not that big of a deal. Pop a breath mint, look 'em in the eye, make sure your fly's up, and you're golden.
Lincoln::: Clyde, I need you to go, too.  Thanks, guys, you're the best.
Lincoln::: Problem solved. I'll just hide under here until the dance is over.
Rusty::: WAH!!! 
Lincoln::: Dang it.
Rusty:::  Gee, that Polly is quite a handful.  And I like it!
Lincoln::: AAAHH!!! 
Zach::: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! 
Giggles:::  Bravo! Ever thought about clowning?
Ronnie Anne::: Lincoln?
Lincoln::: GYAH!
Lincoln:::  All right, party people, I wanna see you on the dance floor! 
Liam::: Hot diggity dang! Turn it on up to 11!
Tabby:::  I love turning it up to 11!
Clyde::: Haiku, I have to be honest. My heart belongs to an older woman. 
Haiku::: That's okay. My heart belongs to an older man.  He just turned 200.
Clyde:::  Unrequited love. Am I right?
DJ::: Hey, kid, what are you doing?
Mrs. Johnson:::  Attention, everyone! The lucky student who gets to have lunch with me in the teachers' lounge is...  ...Lincoln Loud! Uh, Lincoln? Oh, where are you?
Tabby::: Lincoln? Where have you been, mate? You left me standing out there.
Polly::: You?! He's here with me!
Giggles::: Wrong! He's here with me!
Haiku:::  Actually, he's here with me.
Lincoln::: You guys, I'm sorry. I can explain.
Tabby::: Wait. Let me go first. I'm sorry to say this, Lincoln, but would you mind if I hung out with somebody else for the rest of the night? I really hit it off with that guy, Liam.
Giggles::: Yeah, and I'm having a really great time with Zach.
Haiku::: Yes, and I enjoy Clyde. We share the same pain.
Polly::: Same with me and Rusty; though, the pain is mostly his.
Lincoln::: Sure. No problem. I'm glad you're all having fun.
Lincoln:::  How about that? I guess tonight worked out for everyone.
Ronnie Anne::: Hey, Lincoln.
Lincoln:::  GYAH!!! Well, except for me. Guess it's time to come clean.  Ronnie Anne, I'm really sorry. I know I hurt your feelings. I should have just let you ask me to the dance.
Ronnie Anne::: What are you talking about?
Lincoln::: Isn't that why you were looking for me today?
Ronnie Anne:::  To ask you to a lame dance? No! I wanted to invite you to the arcade. There's a two-for-one deal tonight. Since I couldn't find you, I just came here.
Ronnie Anne:::  Wait. So, you knew I was looking for you?
Lincoln:::  Yeah. I was kinda ducking you. Sorry.
Ronnie Anne::: Not cool, Lincoln.  But to be honest, if I thought you were gonna ask me to the dance tonight, I would have ducked you, too.
Lincoln:::  So, we're cool?
Ronnie Anne::: We're cool.
DJ::: We're gonna close out Sadie Hawkins with a slow song. And if you liked what you heard tonight, I'll be spinning at the Feinstein Bar Mitzvah this Saturday. Peace!
Rusty::: WAH!!! 
Lincoln::: Should we do this?
Ronnie Anne::: I'm game if you are.
Game Machine::: DANCE BATTLE START!
Lincoln::: Ooh, watch this.
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, I'm better.
