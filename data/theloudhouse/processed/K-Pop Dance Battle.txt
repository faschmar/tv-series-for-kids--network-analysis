Dance Battle Machine::: Get ready!  Can you beat the one, the only, Yoon Kwan?  Three! Two! One! Dance!  Time's up! Winner! Yoon Kwan! Life is full of dance! Don't give up!
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, man, not again!
Sid::: Awe! Yoon, he's even cooler in the game! But you were so close.
Ronnie Anne::: Thanks, Sid. Just a little more practice and that Yoon Kwan championship jacket will be ours.
Sid::: Don't worry. We'll make you the greatest K-pop dancer this city has ever seen.
Sergio:::  No, pass.  Been there, done that. Need a better prize.  Jackpot!
Ronnie Anne::: Whoa!
Sid::: Hey!
Sergio:::  Sorry. Got a hot date. Need the jacket to look... super fly.
Sid::: Sorry, Sergio, that jacket's for the best dancer. And besides, you'll have to beat the second-place champion, Ronnie Anne.
Sergio:::  Should be like taking candy from a baby.
Ronnie Anne::: Okay. You're on, Sergio. Best dancer wins the jacket.
Sergio:::  Let's dance.
Ronnie Anne::: I had no idea it had that function.
Dance Battle Machine::: Get ready!  Three! Two! One! Dance!
Sid::: Wahoo! Go Ronnie Anne! You can do it!
Dance Battle Machine::: Time's up!  Tied game!
Ronnie Anne::: Sudden death!
Sergio::: You cheated!
Sid::: No way! That jacket's ours!
Dance Battle Machine::: Keep going.
Sergio::: You dance like a human!
Ronnie Anne::: Uh-uh. Rematch! You'll never beat my high score.
Sergio::: I'm the K-pop King, baby!
Sid:::  Benchwarmer.
Dance Battle Machine::: Winner!
Hector::: Ay, qu√© bueno. I've been wanting a new bowling jacket.  Hola, chicos. I'll see you at home. Abuela's making pollo con papas.
Dance Battle Machine::: Continue? Three! Two! One!
