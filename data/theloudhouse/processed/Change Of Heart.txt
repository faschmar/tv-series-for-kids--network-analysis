Lori:::  Whitney, wait till you see my new shoes. They will literally blow your mind!
Clyde:::  L-L-Lori? 
Lori:::  Ugh. Never mind, Whitney.  Lincoln, this is the fourth pair of shoes Clyde's ruined this month!
Lori::: Lincoln, do you have any laundry?
Clyde:::  L-L-Lori? 
Lori::: Hey, you'd better not eat all the leftover gazpacho.
Clyde:::  L-L-Lori?  SYSTEM OVERLOAD. DOES NOT COMPUTE. SYSTEM OVERLOAD. DOES NOT COMPUTE. SYSTEM SHUTTING...DOWN...
Lori::: GAH!
Lori::: Mom, Dad, I'm off to practice!  Clyde?! What are you even doing here?
Clyde:::  L-L-Lori?
Lincoln::: Maybe you should try wearing red shoes.  Right. Bad idea, Lincoln.
Lori:::  Ugh. I just wish Clyde could act normal around me. 
Clyde:::  So do I, my sweet angel. So do I.  But how am I supposed to act normal around such a beautiful, flawless... 
Lincoln:::  Don't worry, buddy. We'll figure something out.
Mr. Grouse:::  Dang blast it! Eberhardt's dog went number two on my lawn again!
Leni::: Try doing what I do, Mr. Grouse. I'll name all 40 states, and by the time I'm done, I've forgotten why I was mad.
Mr. Grouse::: Well, actually, it's 48. But I'll give it a try.  Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California...
Lincoln::: Actually, Clyde, I may know someone who can help you!
Leni::: Sure! What do you need my help with?
Clyde:::  L-L-L-L...
Leni::: Lemons?
Clyde::: L-L-L-L...
Leni::: Leggings?
Clyde::: L-L-L-L-L...
Leni::: Of course! Loofahs! Well, first of all, natural fibers are the way to go.
Lincoln::: He's talking about Lori.
Leni::: Oh. She doesn't use a loofah.  That's why she has bacne.
Clyde::: No, I want to learn how to act normal around her, or at least just stop bleeding on her shoes.
Leni::: Have you tried shoving carrot sticks up your nose?
Clyde::: Yes! And bread sticks, and pretzel rods, and corn dogs, which you really need to let cool down first.
Leni::: Well, no worries! I know other ways to help you. 
Lori::: Lincoln, is Clyde still here? This is literally my last pair of wearable shoes.
Lincoln::: Don't worry about Clyde. He's hanging out with Leni.
Lori::: Really?
Clyde::: Oh, Leni.
Lori's Thoughts::: Leni and Clyde? That's...weird.
Lori:::  If Lori Loud can sink this four-footer, she'll literally win the Masters.
Lynn::: Heads up!
Clyde:::  And if I don't get a nosebleed, I'm usually doing this.  SYSTEM OVERLOAD. DOES NOT COMPUTE. 
Lori's Thoughts::: Hmm...I only thought Clyde acted like an awkward robot around me.
Lori::: Oof! 
Lucy:::  Do you mind? This grave is spoken for.
Lori:::  Carol did what? Hang on, Whitney. I literally need chips for this story.
Leni::: So, when somebody makes me nervous, I just stare at their left ear and recite my ABC's.
Clyde::: Got it! Great tip. 
Lynn:::  Heads up!
Clyde::: Ow! 
Leni:::  My shoes!
Lori's Thoughts::: Now he's getting nosebleeds on her shoes?  This can only mean one thing: Clyde likes Leni!
Lori:::  I'm free! I'm free!  Oh, I am going shoe shopping! 
Leni::: Oh, hi, Clyde. What a nice surprise.
Lori's Thoughts::: Oh, poor Leni. I wouldn't wanna be in her shoes. Literally. Ooh! Lori, that was good.
Leni::: Thanks for the shoe cleaning supplies. It was totes sweet of you. You're the most thoughtful person I've ever met, Clyde.
Lori's Thoughts::: Well, I will give him that. He is pretty thoughtful.
Lori's Thoughts::: Congratulations. A new star has been named after you: Corona Lori-alis.
Clyde::: Whoa!  Oof!
Clyde::: Charles, no! Not on my snow angel!
Teddy Bear::: I love you fur-ever.
Teddy Bear::: I love you fur-ev...  ...er... 
Lori's Thoughts:::  What am I thinking? I have to get Clyde back!
Lori::: Oh, hey, guys. Just wondered if anyone wanted some lemonade.
Lori:::  Clyde?
Lincoln::: Ooh! I'll take some!
Lori:::  Get your own. 
Leni::: Great job, Clyde! You were in the same room as Lori and no nosebleed.
Clyde::: Yeah. Your ABC's trick really worked.
Leni::: It always does...unless you have to go past the letter P 'cause then it gets really hard.  Okay, now let's work on the next step: eye contact.
Lori::: Brr! Boy it is chilly today. So glad I have this cozy scarf Clyde made me.
Lincoln::: It's 85 degrees, and you're sweating.
Lori:::  Clyde, wherever did you learn to be such a great knitter?
Leni::: It worked?
Clyde:::  Yup. I just held my breath, like you said.
Leni::: Great! You're ready for the final step: conversation! But that one we'll need to train for.
Clyde::: Just give me a moment. 
Clyde:::  Okay, I'm ready. Let's do this!
Lincoln:::  Oh, someone's at the door. Who could it be? Why, it's my eldest sister, Lori.
Leni:::  OMG. Bobby, texting, literally.
Lori's Thoughts::: Clyde can ignore the lemonade and the scarf, but this limited edition Ace Savvy comic will definitely do the trick.
Clyde:::  H-h-h-hi, Lori. H-h-h-how's it going?
Leni::: Super job, Clyde!
Lincoln::: Yeah! You sounded totally natural!
Clyde::: Thanks.  The ice pack was a great idea.  It really kept me distracted; though I can't feel my bellybutton.
Leni::: This has been totes fun. You're such a great guy, Clyde.
Clyde::: Thanks, Leni. And may I say, you've never looked more beautiful!
Leni::: Oh, Clyde! 
Lori:::  That does it!
Lori's Thoughts::: So, Clyde likes the way Leni looks? Fine! I can look like Leni!
Lori:::  LEAVE ME ALONE! I'M BUSY!
Lynn::: Uh...why do you look like Leni's messed up twin?
Lori::: Because I'm trying to win Clyde back!
Luan::: Win him back? He's obsessed with you.
Lori::: No. He's obsessed with Leni now. But not for long.
Lana::: Why do you even care?
Lucy::: Yeah. You hide when he comes over and throw his gifts in the trash.
Luan::: You use his homemade cookies as doorstops.
Lori::: Well, yes, but-
Lola::: Do you like Clyde now?
Lori::: Of course not!
Lana::: Well, then why are you trying to win him back?
Lori::: I just need him to like me. Now stop asking questions! I know what I'm doing!  What am I doing?
Lori's Thoughts::: You're trying to win back Clyde. Now stop farting around and straighten that hair!
Lori::: No, I don't need to win Clyde back. I need to apologize to him.
Lori's Thoughts::: Don't be a fool!
Lori::: Shut it! I'm not listening to you anymore.
Lola:::  I don't think I need to tinkle after all.
Leni::: Okay, Clyde, your training is complete. You ready to go have a normal conversation with Lori?
Clyde::: You know it!  I just hope this frozen salmon takes longer to melt than that ice pack did.
Clyde:::  Nice kitties.
Lori::: Clyde! I was just on my way to see you. There's something I really wanted to tell you. First, I wanted to apologize for never appreciating how kind and thoughtful you are. And second, I wanna thank you for making me feel so good about myself all these years. You're a special guy, Clyde, and literally anyone would be lucky to be your crush.
Lincoln::: Lori, what happened?
Lori::: I don't know. I was just telling Clyde that I'm okay with him liking Leni now, and-
Lincoln::: What are you talking about? He doesn't like Leni.
Lori::: But I saw them in the kitchen. He got a nosebleed all over her shoes.
Lincoln::: Yeah, because he got hit in the nose.
Lori::: Well, why was he acting like a robot with her?
Lincoln::: He was just showing her what happens when he's around you.
Lori::: But I was just over at his house. I heard him say she was beautiful.
Lincoln::: Because she was dressed like you!
Lori::: What? Why were they doing all this?
Lincoln::: Because Leni was helping Clyde learn to act normal around you, just like you wanted.
Lori::: So...he never stopped having a crush on me?
Lori's Thoughts::: HA! I knew it!
Lori::: No you didn't!
Lincoln:::  Uh...who are you talking to?
Lori::: No one.
Leni::: Oh, no! Poor Clyde...
Clyde:::  T-T-T-Two Lori's?  SYSTEM OVERLOAD. EE-OO.  EE-OO-EE-OO-EE-OO.
Lori:::  Hm. I'm glad the old Clyde is back.
Clyde:::  EE-OO-EE-OO-EE-OO-EE-OO. 
Mr. Grouse:::  Why you lousy-hmm?  Ooh. Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas...
