Mrs. Johnson::: Okay, class, tomorrow we're wrapping up our biology studies with a special project. We'll be dissecting...  ...frogs!
Mrs. Johnson::: Get ready to jump in!  Really? No one?
Lincoln:::  Dissecting frogs? That sounds-
Lana::: HORRIBLE! You can't do that!
Lincoln::: They're just frogs, Lana. What's the big deal?
Lana:::  I'll show you what the big deal is! 
Lincoln::: Ow! Ow!
Lana::: Watch this movie I made about Hops. 
HOPS::: A Life in Leaps
Narrator Lana::: I'll never forget the day I met my future best friend.
Film Lana::: You're the best froggy. Well, I gotta go. Dad's making meatloaf tonight. Thanks for the fun day.
Film Lana::: Aw. You're lonely, aren't ya, little guy? Would you like to come home and live with me?
Film Lana::: I'm gonna name you Hops.
Film Hops::: 
Narrator Lana::: Since that day, we've been pretty inseparable. We eat all our meals together.
Narrator Lana::: Hops likes his crickets chocolate-covered. But I like mine plain.
Narrator Lana::: We play together. We even get our school photos taken together.
Photographer:::  Alright, kid, smile. Three, two, one. Cheese.
Film Lana::: Nighty-night, buddy. 
Film Hops::: 
Narrator Lana::: I can't imagine what life would be like without my best friend Hops.
Lincoln:::  That was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Lana:::  You see, Lincoln? Frogs are cooler on the outside than they are on the inside. So please, don't dissect them.
Lincoln::: I won't. And neither will anyone else.
Lana::: What do you mean?
Lincoln::: We're going on a rescue mission.
Lana::: Don't forget Hops!
Mrs. Johnson::: Alright, class, when we return from lunch, we'll leap into our frog dissecting!  Come on, people! I'm giving you comedy gold here!
Lincoln::: Lana, where are you?  Oh, good hiding place.
Lana::: What are you talking about? Hops and I were just eating lunch. 
Hops::: 
Lincoln::: Let's go!
Lana::: We have a problem. It's a surface mounted deadbolt with a tumbler locking mechanism.
Lincoln::: In English, please?
Lana::: We'll have to find another way in.
Lincoln:::  Principal Huggins? Wrong room. Wrong room!
Lincoln:::  Good job, Hops.
Lana:::  What's up, frog-ays? We're here to rescue you!
Lincoln:::  Let's go!
Mrs. Johnson:::  My frogs!  PRINCIPAL HUGGINS! PRINCIPAL HUGGINS! 
Lincoln::: Whoa. That open window decoy was brilliant.
Lana::: What do you think, this is my first animal rescue?
Lincoln::: Be free, my amphibian friends! Be free!
Lana::: Good luck, frog-ays! Have a nice life!
Lincoln::: Uh, you guys might wanna get moving.
Lana::: Seriously, guys, go!
Lincoln::: Do you wanna be today's lunch special? MOVE!  Why aren't they moving?
Lana::: Maybe they don't know how to survive in the wild.  HEY, YOU! NOT COOL!  Lincoln, we can't leave them here.
Lincoln:::  You're right. We'll take them home till we can think of a better plan.
Lana::: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!
Lincoln::: They'll be safe here. Come on. We gotta go. Lunch hour's almost up.
Lana::: Alright, Hops, keep an eye on them till we get back.
Lincoln::: Whew.
Principal Huggins::: Good afternoon, class. Mrs. Johnson has informed me that some frogs have gone missing.  Does anyone know anything about that?  Well, I've been in this racket for quite a while, and I think I know what happened. One of you thought you'd be a hero and rescue the poor creatures, and the frogs would be so grateful they'd put up a statue of you! So...who is the frog hero?  Is it you? Ribbit, ribbit?
Lincoln:::  Uh...not me, sir. I'm no hero.
Principal Huggins:::  Okay. No one wants to confess. I guess we can just let it slide.  NOT! I'll find the frog hero myself by searching each of your houses after school! So get ready. Huggins is comin'.
Lincoln:::  LANA!  Wait. It's her after school snack time.  Lana!
Lana::: Hey, Lincoln. Gum?
Lincoln:::  Ugh! Come on. We gotta get home and hide those frogs, stat!
Principal Huggins:::  Open up, Dombrowski! Frog inspection!
Lincoln::: We'll just hide the frogs in the garage. Easy peasy.
Lana::: Not so easy peasy.
Lana::: Hops, how'd the frogs get out?
Lana::: 10 down, 40 to go.
Principal Huggins::: Open up, Loud! Frog inspection!
Principal Huggins::: Good afternoon, children.   Well, I don't see any frogs here. I guess I'll just be on my way.   NOT!
Lincoln::: Let me take your coat. 
Principal Huggins:::  Yes, just put that down anywhere, why don't you?
Lana::: Uh...I didn't want the glare to hurt your eyeballs, sir.
Principal Huggins::: What was that?
Principal Huggins::: You two seem a bit nervous.
Lana:::  Not at all!
Lana:::  Mmm. Protein. 
Lincoln::: Sorry, sir. You had some schmutz on you. Here, let me get you a towel. 
Principal Huggins:::  Stop it!  Hmm...maybe I'll go check UPSTAIRS!
Lincoln:::  Wet willie! Uh...just trying to lighten the mood.
Principal Huggins::: What's this room?
Lincoln::: That's Lucy and Lynn's bedroom. But I wouldn't go in there. Lucy's kinda spooky.
Principal Huggins::: If you think I'm afraid of a little-  That room looks clear.  What's this room?
Lincoln::: That's Lori and Leni's bedroom. But I wouldn't go in there. They have a pretty intense security system.
Principal Huggins::: I'll take my chances.  Well, upstairs looks clear. I need to use your restroom.
Principal Huggins::: I usually do this alone.
Lana::: Oh, right. Sure. Uh, I'm just gonna...check the toilet. Gotta make sure I didn't leave anything in there.  You're good to go!
Principal Huggins::: Well, it appears your house is frog-free, so I'll be on my way.
Lincoln::: Good luck, sir. Keep fighting the good fight.
Lana::: I'll just grab your...  ...coat?
Principal Huggins::: I'll grab my own coat.
Principal Huggins::: What is wrong with you two?
Lana::: Nothin'. Drive safe.
Principal Huggins::: What the-  YOU ARE THE FROG HERO!
Lana::: We're sorry, guys. We failed you.
Lincoln::: If only Principal Huggins could see you the way we do.
Lincoln::: Hops! You beautiful, green, warty genius! Up high, buddy.
Principal Huggins:::  That was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!
Mrs. Johnson:::  Don't hog it, Huggins! I wanna watch it again! 
Lincoln::: See? Frogs are way cooler on the outside.
Principal Huggins::: There is no way we're dissecting them. But what are we going to do with all these frogs?
Lincoln::: I'm glad you asked.
Lana::: We call it the Frog-ay Fortress.
Female Student::: Um, what are those two frogs doing?
Mrs. Johnson:::  CLASS DISMISSED!
Lana::: I'm sorry Principal Huggins gave you detention.
Lincoln::: That's okay. All that matters is that the frogs are safe and things can go back to normal.
Lincoln and Lana::: Tonight's special: roasted duck enchiladas?!
