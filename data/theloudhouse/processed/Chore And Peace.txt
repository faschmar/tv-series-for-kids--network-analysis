Lincoln:::  It's Chore Day at the Loud House, and taking out the trash is my job. And in a family as big as mine, chores can be pretty intense. But we get through 'em because we all do our fair share.
Leni::: Chores all done! 
Lincoln::: Well, except maybe for Leni.  Wait. Two of you do one chore?
Lucy:::  Three of us.
Lucy::: Sigh. 
Lynn:::  Lynn Loud makes the snag!  Touchdown!
Lincoln::: That doesn't seem very fair.
Luna::: Open sesame, bro. 
Lana:::  Little present from Charles!  Special delivery from Cliff!  And airmail from Walt! 
Lincoln::: What about Geo?
Lana::: Oh, I taught him to use the toilet.
Lincoln::: This isn't a chore for you; it's a hobby.
Lana::: Uh-oh! Geo fell in again!  Hang on, baby! Mama's comin'!
Lincoln::: Can I get a little help here?
Lori::: Can't you see I'm doing the laundry?  LOL, Bobby!
Lincoln:::  WHOA!  Dang it.
Luna::: Dude, what gives?
Lincoln::: Alright, everyone! Listen up! It has come to my attention that I've gotten a raw deal in this house!
Leni::: You mean your white hair? It's nice. It makes you look like Pop-Pop.
Lincoln::: I'm not talking about our grandfather! I'm talking about my chore! It's way harder than all of yours, and it's not fair!
Lori::: Please. Our chores are just as hard as yours, if not harder.
Lincoln::: Oh, really? Look at Lisa! What does she even do?
Lisa:::  Uh, hold on a moment, Janice.  I do the bills, Lincoln.  Now, listen, I want that charge removed, Janice. I don't think anyone in this house bought a car in Saskatchewan.
Lincoln::: Well, if you all think your chores are so hard, I'm sure one of you won't mind trading with me.
Lori::: No way, Lincoln. There's a very delicate balance in this house, and if we all start trading chores, it will literally open up a can of worms.
Lana::: What's so bad about that? Worms rule!
Lincoln:::  Okay then...
Lincoln:::  One, two, three, four! I won't do your stupid chore!
Lori::: What the heck are you doing?
Lincoln::: I'm on strike until someone agrees to trade chores with me.  Five, six, seven, eight! Garbage Day will have to wait!
Lana::: What am I supposed to do with all this poop? 
Lincoln:::  Nine, ten, eleven, twelve! Take that poop out by yourself!
Lori::: Ugh! Will you stop talking in chants?
Lincoln:::  Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen!  Uh... 
Lynn Sr.::: Think we should intervene, honey?
Rita::: No, not yet. I wanna see what he rhymes with sixteen. Also, maybe we should let the kids handle this themselves. They might learn something.
Lynn Sr.::: Good idea.  In that case, it's time for ol' Jigsaw Loud to get back in the puzzle game!
Rita:::  Didn't we agree never to use that name again?
Lola::: And that's why I deserve to be the next Miss Cute N' Mean's Beauty Queen. 
Lincoln:::  What do I want? Someone else's chore! When do I want it? Now! What do I want? Someone else's chore! When do I want it?  Ow!
Luna::: So, what'a ya think, Chunk?
Chunk::: It stinks.
Luna::: Way harsh, dude.
Chunk::: Not the song, your room. Chunk's gotta blow. 
Lincoln:::  Think it through, don't be rash, trade with me, or live with trash! Think it through, don't be rash, trade with me, or live with-  Ha! Missed me!
Leni::: Ew!
Leni::: Oh, not with you, Pop-Pop.
Lola::: Princesses cannot live in this filth!
Lana::: It's disgusting, and I know disgusting.
Lucy::: I totally agree.
Lori::: This can't go on. We have to do something.
Lincoln:::  Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Tomorrow I get a whole new Cho...re. Good thing they're giving in. 'Cause I'm all out of rhymes.
Lincoln::: Lori, where's all my clean laundry?
Lori::: Hm...laundry, laundry...oh! I didn't do it.
Lincoln::: And why not?
Lincoln::: Ha! You're going on strike?
Lana::: We're all going on strike until you end yours!
Lori::: That means no laundry, no clean dishes, no vacuuming...
Lisa::: ...and no doing the bills.  Janice, cut the power and the water. We're going off the grid.
Lincoln:::  Well, good luck! 'Cause I'm not backing down!
Sisters::: NEITHER ARE WE!
Lori:::  One, two, three, four! I won't wash your clothes no more!
Luna::: CHORES! HUH! WHAT ARE THEY GOOD FOR?!
Sisters::: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! SAY IT AGAIN!!!
Lynn Sr.::: Now should we intervene?
Rita::: Oh, no. Let's give the kids a little more time to resolve this on their own.
Lynn Sr.::: Sweet! Who's up for round two? Jiggy Loud's about to do a pizzy up in this bizzy! 
Rita::: Uh-uh.
Lincoln::: Ew. What is that?
Lynn::: Bunch of hair from the sink drain. Makes a great footbag. 
Lincoln:::  Hey, Lori, now that Lisa stopped paying the bills, it must be pretty hard having no cell service.
Lori::: Who needs cell service?-- I found a new way to text Bobby.  Fly away, my faithful messenger!
Lori::: What? Phones crash all the time. 
Lincoln::: Pretty messy in here. Must be pretty hard to get any work done.
Lisa::: On the contrary. The garbage and my chemicals have fused, creating a scientific breakthrough. I call him Homo Trashilius. Or Trashy for short.
Lynn Sr.::: Okay, now should we intervene?
Rita::: I still think the kids can solve this themselves. Besides the house has...looked worse.  Aw, come here, sweetie. 
Lynn Sr.::: Round three with Jiggy P?
Rita::: Mm... 
Lynn::: HELP! MY FOOTBAG'S OUT OF CONTROL!
Lincoln:::  This could all be over if you'd just end your strike.
Lynn:::  NOT TILL YOU END YOOOOURS!!! 
Reporter::: Hi, we're from the Miss Cute N' Mean pageant, here to do a behind the scenes interview with Miss Lola Loud.
Lola:::  ♪ Here she is! The next Miss Cute N' Mean! ♪ 
Reporter:::  Ew! More like Miss Gross N' Gnarly! Interview over!
Lola::: NO!  You...THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!!! 
Clyde::: Lori!
Clyde::: Walt brought me your text. Usually, I bleed profusely from my nose, turn into a robot, and eventually faint when I'm around you, but this has given me the confidence to say... 'I LOVE YOU, TOO!'
Lori::: WHAT?!
Clyde::: Don't worry. I already broke the news to Bobby. He took it pretty hard, but a really nice cheerleader is consoling him. 
Lincoln:::  Phew! Finally lost Lola.
Lori:::  YOU!!! 
Lisa:::  TRASHY! BAD!  No, no, not you, Janice.
Lincoln::: Lisa! What have you been feeding him?
Lisa::: His name is Trashy. What do you think, genius?
Trashy::: Baby?
Lori:::  Great, Lincoln. You made Lily cry.
Lincoln::: There, there. It's okay, Lily. 
Lana:::  I'm more than just poop patrol.
Lincoln::: Guys, if the raccoon was in the crib... then where's Lily?
Kids::: LILY!!!
Lincoln::: She's in here somewhere!
Lucy::: We'll never find her in this mess.
Lincoln::: We have to clean up!  I declare this strike officially over!  Ow! Who's with me?
Sisters::: WE ARE!!! 
Lisa:::  Janice, how soon can we get back on the grid? 24 hours? What if I throw in a muffin basket?
Lincoln::: Come on! You gotta be around here somewhere!
Lincoln::: Hang on, Lily! Your big brother's coming! 
Lucy:::  There's a better way.
Luan::: Wash and learn! 
Lucy::: Sigh. 
Lincoln::: Hang on, Lily! I'm coming!  So...much...underwear!
Lori:::  Yeah, and that's just Dad's. Now get outta my way, little bro. I've got a system. 
Clyde::: Hey, sugar lips. Should our couple name be Clori or Llyde?
Lori::: Bobby and I are back together.
Clyde:::  ABORT. ABORT. 
Lana::: Poop patrol is done, but no Lily!
Lola:::  Beds are made, no Lily!
Trashy:::  No baby!
Lola:::  Maybe she's under all this trash!
Lincoln::: Step aside!  Taking out the trash... is my job.
Lori::: Well, we've all done our chores, and there's still no Lily.
Lincoln:::  This is all my fault! For the rest of my life...  ...Ill be haunted by the sound of her adorable giggling!
Rita::: Lincoln, what are you crying about?
Lincoln::: Mom, I confess! We lost- ... Lily? Have you guys had her this whole time?
Rita:::  Of course. You didn't think we'd leave her in that mess, did you?
Lynn Sr.::: You know, we're proud of you guys for working this out. Now, who wants to a puzzle with J to the Iggy?
Kids::: Who?
Lincoln:::  When it comes to chores, nobody in the Loud House has it easy. The truth is, we all do our fair share. 
Mr. Grouse:::  Hey, Loud! Don't bother! There's no trash pickup this week! The garbage workers are striking for more money!
Lincoln:::  Wait! They get paid to take out the trash?!
Kids:::  ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR! GIVE US CASH OR NO MORE CHORES!
Rita::: Any ideas, J Pizzy?
Lynn Sr.::: Now this is a puzzle.  Can you call me that again?
Rita::: J Pizzy.
Lynn Sr.::: YES!
