Richie::: I hear the screams are so loud, you can't even hear yourself scream.
Trent::: I hear it's so scary, they give you diapers before you go in.
Chandler::: I hear a deranged clown chases you with barbecue tongs. 
Lincoln::: What are you guys talking about?
Richie::: The Royal Woods House of Terror just opened up for the season and we're finally old enough to go.  Check it out, zombies, vampires, mutants, all waiting to pounce on you the minute you step inside.
Chandler:::  Dude, don't bother telling them about it, they'll never go. Everyone knows they're the biggest chickens in our class.
Lincoln::: Oh yeah?! Then how come we already got tickets to it, Chandler.
Clyde::: We did?  Oh, right, we did, I totally forgot, because I'm so excited, and not at all terrified.
Chandler::: Oh, really? When are you going?
Lincoln::: Uh, tomorrow night.
Chandler:::  Cool. Then we'll get our tickets for tomorrow night too. That way, we can all go together. 
Clyde:::  Great. Looking forward to it.
Chandler::: I'll bet you are. 
Lincoln::: Oh man! What did we just do? How are we gonna get through the House of Terror?
Clyde:::  I won't even get up to pee at night if my Blarney night light isn't on!  I'd better call Dr. Lopez.  Oh no, it went to voicemail! 
Lincoln::: Wait...  ...I've got an idea. Maybe we can toughen ourselves up before tomorrow night, so we'll be able to handle the House of Terror, and I know who can help us. 
Lincoln::: So, what do you say? Are you up for scaring the daylights out of us?
Lola::: Yeah!
Leni::: I'm in!
Lisa::: Lucy, you're our resident scream queen. What do you suggest?
Lucy::: I've got a few ideas.  We're ready, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: We can do this.
Clyde::: Totally.
Lincoln & Clyde:::  Clincoln McCloud! 
Lincoln::: Uh... it doesn't look so bad.
Lincoln::: Thanks for the encouraging pat, buddy.
Clyde::: You too.
Lincoln & Clyde:::  That's not me...
Sisters except Lori:::  BOO!
Sisters except Lori::: Whoops.
Lucy::: This is my fault. I gave you too much fright too soon.
Lincoln:::  It's okay.
Clyde:::  You meant well.
Lucy::: We'll dial the scares back a little for round two.
Lincoln::: Okay, Luce, we're ready to try again.
Clyde::: What have you got for us?
Lucy::: Actually, I just ordered you guys a pizza.  Oh, and there it is.
Clyde::: Pizza? Not afraid of that.
Lincoln::: Me neither.
Lincoln & Clyde:::  Puh-puh-puh-pizza! 
Lynn:::  Huh. Too much?
Lucy::: Sorry. I'll dial it back some more.
Lucy::: You guys better now?  Okay, let's try this again. 
Lisa::: Lincoln, Clyde, I'm glad you're here. I have a bone to pick with you.  Or should I say, two-hundred and six bones.
Lucy::: Sigh.
Lucy::: Here's an easy one, all you have to do is go down in the basement.
Lincoln::: We can definitely do this.  Though it sure is dark down there.
Lucy::: Sigh.
Lucy::: All you have to do is go in my room and open the coffin.
Clyde::: Brightly lit empty room. We got this one.
Clyde::: It's empty.
Lincoln::: Phew. That wasn't so bad.
Lucy:::  I knew you could do it.
Lucy::: Sigh. Okay, even less scary. Got it.
Lucy::: Lily, wrong time to break out your new wolf jammies.
Lucy::: Sigh.
Lori:::  Hey guys.
Bobby:::  What's the word?
Lori::: Uh, why are you wrapped in blankets? And Lincoln, why are you holding Bun-Bun?
Lincoln::: Lucy's been trying to prep us to go to the House of Terror tonight.
Clyde::: We told some classmates we'd meet them there, and we don't wanna look like chickens.
Bobby::: Dudes, I worked at the House of Terror a few seasons ago. I used to haul people to the first aid tent when they passed out.
Clyde::: Passed out?
Bobby::: Yeah, I'd just throw 'em in the wheelbarrow.
Lincoln::: Wheelbarrow?
Bobby::: Tell you what, why don't I call and see if any of my friends still work there. I'm sure they'd let us take a tour of the place with all the lights on. Maybe that would help make you less scared.
Lincoln & Clyde::: That'd be awesome!
Lincoln::: This place doesn't look so bad, Clyde.
Clyde::: Yeah, we got this.  Why hello there, Mr. Squirrel, high five.  Boop.
Bobby::: You guys ready for the tour?
Clyde::: We gotta stop doing that.
Bobby::: You can do this, little dudes, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Lincoln & Clyde::: SPIDER WEBS!
Bobby::: Check it.  They're just string.
Lincoln & Clyde::: Huh.
Bobby::: They're just paper-mâché.  Styrofoam.  Food coloring.  Toilet paper.  Yogurt with fruit mixed in.  See? It's all special effects.
Lincoln::: I guess you're right.  That's not!
Bobby::: No, it's just Mrs. Bernardo, my old drama teacher. Hey, Mrs. B.
Mrs. Bernardo:::  Bobby, what a nice surprise. What brings you back to Royal Woods?
Bobby::: Just giving my friends a tour.
Mrs. Bernardo:::  Hello.
Lincoln & Clyde::: Hello. 
Mrs. Bernardo:::  Tell your mom we miss her at bingo. 
Bobby::: Will do.  Relax, that's just Mr. Wiznuski, the crossing guard. He likes jobs where he can be on his feet.
Clyde::: Oh, thank you, sir.
Bobby::: And finally, this is what we in the haunted house biz call a 'bail out' door. 
Clyde::: Ooooh.
Bobby::: Things get too scary tonight, you can just run outside here.
Lincoln::: Thanks Bobby, but I don't think we'll need it.
Clyde::: Yeah, this place is just special effects and friendly town folk. It's not scary at all.
Lincoln::: You really saved our butts, Bobby. Can we treat you to a thank you Flippee?
Bobby::: Oh-ho, you bet. But before we leave, I want to go to say 'hi' to the flesh-eating mutant. He's my old T-ball coach.
Lincoln::: We've totally got this, Clyde.
Clyde::: Totally.
Lincoln::: Awww. An encouraging squirrel high five.  Boop.
Lincoln::: Ms. Bernardo?
Clyde::: Aren't you supposed to be inside getting ready to scare people?
Mrs. Bernardo::: Not anymore. Management just let the entire staff go.
Lincoln::: What, why?
Mrs. Bernardo::: Word got back to them that you kids took a tour today and didn't find the place very scary.  So, they decided to do a complete overhaul. Apparently, it's a hundred times scarier now.
Clyde:::  It's scarier?! And we got everyone fired?! This is a double bagger. 
Mrs. Bernardo:::  Don't worry about me, honey. This gives me more time  to work on my one woman shoooooowwwwww~! 
Clyde::: What are we going to do? We'll never get through this! 
Lincoln::: Maybe we can get out of here before Chandler shows up.
Chandler:::  What up, chumps?
Lincoln::: Dang it.
Chandler::: You guys actually made it? I didn't think you would.  After you.
Lincoln:::  Sure is dark in here.
Chandler:::  We'll go this way, you chumps go that way.  See you chickens at the exit.
Zombies::: Braaaiiinnns.
Lincoln::: We gotta find that bail out door!
Clyde::: My thoughts exactly.
Chandler:::  That was, the scariest experience of my life. 
Trent::: I need a hug. 
Chandler::: Well, who's gonna hug me?
Richie::: Bring it in dude.
Lincoln::: Oh man, the bail out door was much farther than I thought.
Clyde::: They really, need to work on their, signage.
Lincoln::: Hey guys, how'd you get out before us?
Chandler:::  Ooh, well, uh...
Trent::: We took the bail out door. That place was way too scary.
Richie::: Guess you guys made it all the way through.
Lincoln:::  Yeah, I guess we did.
Chandler:::  Are you gonna rat us out to everyone at school for being chickens?
Lincoln::: Nah, that wouldn't be cool.
Chandler::: Oh, you guys are alright. I'm sorry for always messing with you.
Lincoln::: Forget it.
Clyde::: Yeah, we're good.
Chandler::: Hey, you guys wanna go to Gus' for some pizza?
Lincoln::: Sure.
Clyde::: Sounds great.
Lincoln::: Wow, friends with Chandler, who would have thunk it?
Clyde::: Do you think we should tell him we only made it to the end because we couldn't find the bail out door?
Lincoln and Clyde::: Nah.
Lincoln::: That'll be our little secret.  Ahh, he's wearing a crow costume.
Clyde:::  Are you trying to scare us too? You cute little-
