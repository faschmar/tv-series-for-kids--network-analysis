Lynn Sr.::: Dinner's ready! Come and get it!
Lincoln:::  Yeah, so this never happens. Dad cooks all our dinners, and he's not a bad cook, but his repertoire is kind of limited.  You've got Salisbury Steak Sundays, Meatball Mondays, Turkey Loaf Tuesdays, Wienerschnitzel Wednesdays, Goulash Thursdays, Fish Fry Fridays, and Succotash Saturdays.  Then it all repeats, week, after week, after week. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go choke down some...
Lynn Sr.::: ...wienerschnitzel. Not to brag, but this tastes exactly like last Wednesday's, and I've got this recipe dialed in!
Lola::: What are you doing?
Lincoln::: Self hypnosis. Maybe it can make myself believe the wienerschnitzel tastes like ice cream.
Lola:::  Oh, I want ice cream! Move!
Lincoln:::  Come up with your own coping mechanism!
Lynn Sr.::: No! No, no, no, no, no!  Whew! That was close. I almost had to order us pizza. Ha ha.
Leni::: You guys, I need an outfit for dinner tomorrow.  Does this print go with goulash?
Lincoln:::  It doesn't matter, 'cause we're not having goulash tomorrow.
Lori::: Yes we are, Lincoln. We have it every Thursday, and there's literally nothing we can do about it.
Lucy::: She's right. It's all in my poem.  Dinner. The same seven meals. How do you cope? The only plan is to give up hope. Dinner.
Leni::: So true.
Luan::: Say it, sister!
Lisa::: Wise words.
Lincoln::: Fine. I guess no one wants...pizza~.
Lana::: Did someone say pizza?
Lincoln::: When the schnitzel fell off the table, Dad said he almost had to order pizza. So, if we sabotage tomorrow's dinner, that's what we'll get. Now, huddle up.  Lana, why don't you rinse off first?
Lynn Sr.:::  I just came back from the grocery store, gonna get my goulash on. Noodles, tomatoes, meat galore, gonna get my goulash-
Lincoln:::  Hey, Dad! There's something I've always wondered about. Why do you make goulash on Thursdays?
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, son. It's a funny story. Thursdays are a bit of a conundrum. Not many foods start with TH.  There's Thai food, but coconut milk really does a number on the old Lynn-testines, if you know what I'm saying.  And three-bean salad; well, that's just three times as bad, right? Now there is a Greek dish called Thessalonikian sheep dip, but your mother finds it a little gamey.
Lincoln:::  You're right. That is a funny story. Gotta go! 
Lynn Sr::: But, son, I didn't tell you about threatened-species stir fry yet! It's very rare! Get it?
Lincoln::: Good work, team! If my calculations are correct, Dad should be ordering pizza in...  ...T minus 15 seconds.
Lynn Sr.:::  An orange? Where's all my goulash stuff? I know I bought it, 'cause I was singing about it! Dang it!  I guess I'll have to...
Lincoln::: Three, two, one.
Lynn Sr.::: ...go back to the store!
Sisters:::  Aw...
Lisa::: I knew I should've chloroformed him. Unconscious people can't make goulash.
Lana:::  Don't worry. Dad's not going anywhere.
Lynn Sr.::: Gah! Well, my horoscope did say Libras should expect the unexpected today.  Bad news, kids. I gotta put the kibosh on tonight's goulash.
Kids:::  Aw...
Luan::: What a shame.
Lynn::: Too bad.
Lori::: I need to take a moment.
Lynn Sr.::: But fortunately, your old dad's got a backup plan.
Lola::: I'll get the phone, Daddy!
Lynn Sr.::: I'm...making tomorrow's dinner tonight! Frank and beans Friday on Thursday. In your face, horoscope! 
Lisa::: I'll get the chloroform.
Lynn Sr.:::  Franks and beans. Doo doo doo. Franks, yeah, yeah,. And beans and beans. And beans, and beans beans beans
Lincoln::: Big Cheese to Toppings. Target is in position. Move out.
Luan:::  Be careful, guys. There's not mushroom for error. 
Lincoln::: Luan, this line is not for jokes!
Lynn Sr.:::  My baked beans! What is happening? I guess there's only one thing to do.  Make franks and lima beans!
Lynn Sr.::: Where the heck is our can opener?
Lynn Sr.::: Ah, thank you, Geo. Nothing like a little Lynn-genuity.
Lynn Sr.:::  Where are the dang knives?  I've got 20 hot dogs to slice!
Lynn Sr.::: Ah! Pot raccoons!  No problem. We'll do a casserole.
Lynn Sr.::: I'll just heat 'er up in the old coffee pot. That's using the old bean.
Lynn Sr.::: Dang it.
Lincoln::: I'm proud of you guys. It was touch-and-go for a while, but we all hung in there, and-
Lynn Sr.::: Dinner's served!  Franks, franks and beans, they're lima. Franks and beans
Kids:::  WHAT?!
Lynn Sr.::: It's not exactly hot, but I'd rather eat cold beans than a plate of failure.
Lynn Sr.:::  Someone get me the phone...
Lincoln::: Yes! Pizza!
Lucy:::  Dinner. Goulash again? That's a nope. A bite of pizza; it tastes like hope. Dinner. 
Lincoln:::  Wow. What a night. Maybe next week we can get Dad to order Chinese.
Lynn Sr.:::  WHY IS THERE MEAT IN MY SHOES?!
Lincoln:::  Dang it.
Rita::: Does anyone have anything to say?
Lincoln:::  Leni, why would you hide the meat in the slippers Dad wears every night?
Leni:::  Because his pockets were full.
Lynn Sr.:::  What is this? Pasta? Someone please explain why I'm wearing my goulash?
Lincoln::: We did it, Dad. We sabotaged dinner so you'd order us pizza.  We're really sorry. But eating the same dinners over and over again was driving us crazy.
Rita:::  You guys have no idea how hard it is to cook seven nutritious meals a week for 13 different people on a budget. I'd say your dad does a pretty great job.
Lynn Sr.:::  Aw, that means a lot, honey.
Rita::: You'll understand someday when you have to cook for your own family.
Lincoln::: Cook for your own family? That's it! Let us make dinner tomorrow night. We have tons of ideas. Dad will get a break, we'll make something delicious and show you it's not that hard to mix up the meal.
Lynn Sr.::: Fine by me.
Leni::: Ooh! We could probably use this onion.
Lincoln::: Remember, guys, this is about more than just tonight's dinner. These grilled cheeses really have to change hearts and minds.
Lola::: Grilled cheese? I wanna make a cake!
Lori::: I can't eat cake for dinner. I'll literally break out!
Luna::: Let's make shepherd's pie! It's Mick Swagger's favorite, dudes.
Leni::: You guys, I got it. Let's make goulash!
Lincoln::: We did all this so we wouldn't have to eat goulash!
Leni::: And now I miss it.
Lisa::: Might I suggest something more sophisticated? Perhaps a vichyssoise?
Lynn:::  We need body fuel. I'll blend us up some protein shakes.
Lola::: Your brain's been blended if you think I'm drinking that barf.
Lana:::  Wait! We can drink barf?
Lincoln::: Grilled cheese beats all!
Lynn::: Protein shake!
Lola::: Cake!
Lori::: Guys, guys, stop! We'll do a potluck. Everyone will make their own dish.
Lincoln::: Great idea. Then we'll have nothing to fight about.
Lana::: It's mine! I need it for my scrambly eggs!
Lucy::: Well, I need it for my deviled eggs.
Luan::: Mind if I poach that?  Get it?
Lori:::  Literally?
Lisa::: MY VICHYSSOISE!
Lola:::  MY CAKE!
Lynn Sr.::: Guys? Everything okay in there?
Leni::: Like, awesome!
Lana::: Super!
Lynn Sr.::: Good! Your mom and I are getting hungry for dinner! Hope you're almost ready to fork it over!
Lori::: You guys, we've got nothing!
Lincoln::: Failure is not an option! We have to serve something, or we'll be eating the same seven dinners forever!
Lynn Sr.::: Wow. You made, uh...
Lisa::: Potatoes.
Lori::: Quinoa.
Luan::: Turkey.
Lucy::: Chicken.
Luna::: Meatloaf.
Lynn::: Bologna.
Lola::: Frosting.
Lincoln::: Cereal.
Leni::: Goulash.
Lana::: Barf.
Lincoln::: Well, bon app√©tit!
Rita:::  Mmm, it's, uh...
Lori::: I can't get it off my tongue!
Lincoln::: Mom, Dad, we're sorry. You guys were right. Cooking for this many people is a nightmare. We'll never complain about your food again.
Lana::: We promise.
Luan::: We didn't mean it.
Lola::: I'm not keeping that promise. 
Lynn::: Now that we totally learned our lesson, can we order pizza?
Siblings:::  Pizza!
Lana::: Indian!
Rita::: Sorry, kids. Our food budget for this week is shot.
Lana::: So we're not having any dinner?
Lynn Sr.::: Nonsense! Necessity is the mother of Lynn-vention! To the kitchen!
Lynn Sr.::: So, what have we got?
Lincoln::: I found a jar of olives!
Lori::: This spoon still has a little mustard on it.
Lynn::: And I've got some chopped up sports bars.
Luna::: And I've got some jams!
Luan::: Ooh! Where?  Oh. Those kind of jams.
Lynn Sr.::: Olives.  Pepper.  Baking pan.  Other half of baking pan.  Tape. Stat, man! Stat!
Leni::: What are you making, Dad?
Lynn Sr.::: I'm not really sure, but let's call it...Casa Loud Casserole! 
Leni::: Ooh! I have the perfect outfit for that!
Rita::: Honey, that was delicious.
Lola::: Amazing!
Leni::: So good!
Lynn Sr.::: Thank you. I think you kids were right. It's time I started mixing up the menu.
Kids:::  Really?!
Lynn Sr.::: Yep. In fact, I'm going to the store right now to get some new Lynn-gredients.
Lana::: Oops. Heh, heh.  Forgot to put the brake pads back on.
