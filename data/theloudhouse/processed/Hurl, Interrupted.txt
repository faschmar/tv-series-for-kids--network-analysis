Lynn::: Gangway, burger eaters!
Paula::: Wait up, you guys!
Lynn::: Grant, hit us!  Here's to us, guys.  The new Tri-County roller derby champions. We really earned these burgers.
Paula, Maddie, Margo and Lynn::: Yeah!
Maddie::: I'd hip check just for fun. But when you win a prize for it... We're doing good work here, people.
Paula:::  And when the prize is a free trip to Dairyland, it's even sweeter.
Margo::: I can't wait to ride Whipped Scream again.  I watched this like a million times.
Maddie::: I heard about this kid that went on it just one time and he never stopped barfing...  Oh, you're awfully quiet, Lynn. Aren't you pumped for Dairyland?
Lynn::: Pfft. Of course, I am.  Who's saying that I don't wanna go to Dairyland, huh?  Anyone who says that is getting an elbow to the glutes.
Lynn::: Psst. Clyde.
Clyde::: Oh, hey, Lynn.
Lynn::: I need your advice.
Clyde::: Umm... OK. But what if I'm terrified of giving the wrong advice? Doctor Lopez says I tend to let my fear control me.
Lynn::: Bingo! And that's exactly why I came to you.  Let's says I had his friend, and this friend are super tough and awesome at everything. But she- or he, was afraid of just one thing.
Clyde::: Lynn, no disrespect, but I don't have time for hypotheticals. How can I help you?
Lynn::: Fine. Here's the deal. I'm going to Dairyland tomorrow, and I don't want to ride Whipped Scream, because I'm terrified of throwing up.  Blech.
Clyde::: Lynn, no one likes to throw up.
Lynn::: Yeah, but I hate it. I did it once when I was little, and it got all into my nose and I tasted it for a week.  Never again. So how do I beat this stupid fear and get on with my life?
Clyde::: You can't beat it. You just need to live with it and be honest with your friends about it. Look them right in the eye, and say 'I am not comfortable with this situation'.
Lynn:::  That's dumb. What else you got.
Clyde::: There's no other way. Dr. Lopez says you have to own up to your fears. Otherwise, you end up shoving them so far down that they come out in really weird ways.  And I have a fear of being tardy. So can I please go?
Lynn:::  Fine.  I'll just have to figure something else out. Thanks for nothing, McBride!
Margo::: I've planned the whole day around riding Whipped Scream.
Maddie::: Yep. We go on it at eleven, three, and five o'clock. With bathroom breaks built in for post-ride cleanup.
Paula::: Okay, I am just gonna be honest with you guys.  Big rollercoasters scare me.  I don't want to go on Whipped Scream.
Lynn:::  Uh, actually, I kind of...
Margo::: What a scaredy cat.
Maddie::: Right?  Lynn, Margo, come on, let's hit the big girl ride. Paula, you can go ride the Li'l Skimmer.
Toddler::: Yay!
Paula:::  Okay, fine. I'm coming.
Lynn::: Wait, uh, why rush into things, right? Let's take in the other wonders that Dairyland has to offer first, and save Whipped Scream for last.  The longer we wait, the bigger the barf will be.
Maddie and Margo::: Alright.
Lynn::: Really? Oh, phew.  I mean, who wants to see the Butter Churning show?  Let's go!
Kai::: Hey, Dairylanders. I'm Kai, churn maiden. And today, I'm gonna teach you all about butter churning.  It takes about sixty to ninety minutes of vigorous churning to get your butter nice and creamy. Can I get a volunteer to help?
Lynn::: Yeah, yeah, yeah! Let's churn, baby, churn!
Kai::: Uh, miss. I... I think it's ready.
Lynn:::  Are you kidding me? This stuff needs at least another hour.   I'll go.
Lynn::: Isn't Seas O' Cheese great?
Puppets:::Dairy binds the world together. Dairy binds us all. 
Margo:::  Lynn, this is lame.
Lynn::: Ssh! We're about to hit Switzerland!
Puppets::: Dairy binds the world together. Dairy binds us all. If you're feelin' kinda farty, you can blame it on Havarti! 
Tippy::: Hello, Dairylanders! It's your old pal, Tippy the Cow. Due to some unforeseen curdlin', it looks like we're gonna be stuck here for a little while.
Lynn::: Oh, gee, that's a shame. Guess we got to wait.
Margo::: Ugh, I'm starving.
Lynn:::  Well, look around. There's all the cheese curds and milk you could ask for!  And it's a great way to load up on calcium.
Margo:::  Eww! I've had enough of this. I want to ride Whipped Scream!
Maddie::: Me too. I say we swim for it.
Lynn::: Wait! Don't you want to sail through the Land of Lactose? Ugh, dang it.
Paula::: Guys! I can't get my cast wet!
Maddie::: Finally, Whipped Scream, here we come!
Lynn::: Whoa, look at that! 
Margo::: Lynn, seriously? It's just the petting zoo. Come on.
Animal Handler::: Hi, there. Wanna meet Ursula, the angriest cow in Michigan?
Lynn::: Heck, yeah, we do!
Margo:::  Okay, Lynn, that's it. You've been stalling all day. I'm starting to think that you don't want to ride Whipped Scream.
Lynn::: What? That's a load.
Maddie:::  Then let's go ride it right now.
Paula::: Uh, Lynn, are you sure you want to drink that Dairy-ana Grande Iced Cheese-uccino before we ride?
Lynn::: Just worry about yourself there, champ.
Maddie:::  Hey, we're next.
Lynn::: Hey, don't push me! Whoa!  Oh man, it's broken! Oh well, let's go.
Passenger::: It's even faster now!
Lynn::: Ursula.  Sorry, guys, gotta pee. 
Tippy::: Hey, hey, Dairylanders, it's your old pal, Tippy.  No need to panic, but there's a wild, rampaging cow loose in the park.
Maddie::: Hey, Lynn. There you are. Can you believe it? We're not going to get to go on Whipped Scream.
Lynn::: Oh, I heard, but safety first, right? I'm sure we'll have plenty more chances to ride another time. We got our whole lives ahead of us.
Tippy::: Actually, you don't.  No, no, I mean about the ride. Today is the last day of Whipped Scream. We're closing it down to break ground on the new Dairyland Hotel.
Paula, Margo & Maddie::: What?!
Lynn::: Oh, what?
Tippy::: What's the only thing better than playing at Dairyland? Staying at Dairyland! Now, run for your lives! Come on, everyone! Moo-ve! 
Margo::: Ugh. I can't believe we missed our chance for a final ride on Whipped Scream.
Maddie::: I know. It's not fair. We'll never get to ride it again.
Lynn::: Uh, I'll be right back.
Lynn::: Ursula, there you are. Let's put down the cow head and head back to your pen now.
Lynn::: Whoa, girl!  Nice move! You ever thought about joining a roller derby team?
Tippy::: That was amazing!
Lynn:::  You're welcome. Now you can reopen the park.
Tippy::: Oh, thanks, kid.
Maddie::: Woohoo! Lynn, that was incredible! Thanks to you, we're going to get our puke on.
Lynn::: Yup, you guys have fun.
Margo::: Wait, aren't you coming with us?
Lynn:::  No, I'm not. I should have been honest with you guys from the start. I don't want to go on Whipped Scream because I'm terrified of throwing up. I know you're all gonna give me a hard time, but it's just how I feel.
Maddie::: We're not going to give you a hard time.
Lynn::: You mean you don't think I'm being a total wimp?
Margo::: No way. Would a total wimp be brave enough to ride the angriest cow in Michigan?
Maddie::: If you don't wanna go on Whipped Scream, it's totally cool with us.
Lynn::: Yes! Not today, barf!
Margo::: Paula, sorry we gave you a hard time about not riding. You're still cool with us.
Paula::: Oh, it's fine. Now go puke your brains out.
Maddie::: Whoo-hoo!
Margo::: All right!
Paula::: I am so glad that is not us up there. Right, Lynn?  Lynn?
Flashback Lynn::: All the cheese and milk curds you could ask for!  Whoa, girl!
Paula::: You don't look so good.
Lynn:::  I don't feel so good either.
Paula::: Are you okay, Lynn?
Lynn::: Actually, I'm fine. I mean, barfing wasn't fun, but it also wasn't nearly as bad as I remember.
Margo::: Oh, that was amazing. Let's go again!
Lynn::: You know what?  I'm in. I'm not afraid of throwing up anymore.
Maddie::: Sweet! Let's get back in line.
Lynn::: Shoosh, yeah. Paula, are you okay here by yourself?
Paula:::  Oh, I am good. Go get your puke on.
Lynn:::  Whoop, whoop! Let's barf, baby!
Maddie & Margo::: Whoop whoop!
