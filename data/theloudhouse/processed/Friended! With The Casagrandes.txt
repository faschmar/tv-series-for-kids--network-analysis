Ronnie Anne:::  Gah! Lalo, what the heck, dude?
Sergio:::  Time for breakfast. Early bird gets the chilaquiles. 
Ronnie Anne:::  Chilaquiles? 
Rosa::: Andale! Eat, eat!
Ronnie Anne:::  Morning, Abuela.  You're in a hurry today.
Rosa::: Si, mija, the apartment upstairs is vacant, and as buliding manager, it's my job to show it to potential tenants.
CJ:::  And it's my job to help!
Ronnie Anne::: Sweet tool belt, CJ. Is that a new hammer?
CJ:::  It's also a screwdriver. 
Ronnie Anne::: Ooh.  Morning, Mom.
Maria::: Good morning, sweetie, got any plans for the day?
Ronnie Anne::: Yeah, I'm gonna take my board to the park, and work out some new tricks.
Maria::: Sounds fun. Remember to wear your-
Ronnie Anne:::  C'mon, Mom, you don't have to remind me. I've heard enough of your ER stories to know better.
Maria::: Oh, that reminds me, you won't believe what we found in a patient's stomach yesterday. At first, we thought it was a hairball, but-
Carlota:::  You know we love you, Tia, but some of us are eating.
Ronnie Anne::: Text me the details.
Maria:::  Oh, thanks for the plate, hon!
Bobby::: Morning, fam! Better take breakfast to go, Abuela, I gotta get downstairs to open the mercado.
Hector::: Gracias, mijo, what a good grandson, letting your Abuelo relax and enjoy his coffee.
Bobby::: Thanks, Abuela! 
Ronnie Anne::: Wait, Bobby, your apron! 
Bobby:::  Thanks, sis!
Carl::: Wait up, cuz! You need me to supervise! 
Sergio::: Mine!
Ronnie Anne:::  Better luck next time, dude.
Rosa:::  Yes, Mr. Scully, I'm going to open up the apartment right now! I think we're going to get a lot of applicants!
Ronnie Anne:::  Abuela, your keys!
Rosa:::'  Anyway, I'll be sure to have the- 
Ronnie Anne:::  Now, to finally eat.  Ha! You're really laying it on thick, aren't you?  Go ahead, I'll grab something on my way to the park.  Just don't tell Abuela.
Lincoln::: So, how's big city life?
Ronnie Anne::: Great. Funny thing, I thought I saw you the other day, but it was just an old dude with white hair.
Lincoln::: Heh, yeah, I get that a lot.  Oof! Sorry, Ronnie Anne! It's breakfast time. I gotta go before one of my sisters swipes my bagel!
Ronnie Anne::: Smell ya later.  Morning, Bruno, I'll have the Great Lakes City special, one dog dragged through the garden.
Bruno::: You want a hot dog with the works, at 9am?
Ronnie Anne::: Yup.
Bruno:::  You sure I can't interest you in a danish or something?
Sid::: Excuse me, can I get one Great Lakes City Special?
Ronnie Anne:::  See? This girl gets it.  Later, dude!
Bruno:::  Eh.
Ronnie Anne::: Ah! Come on.
Ronnie Anne::: Yes!  Not gonna lie, kinda wish someone saw that.
Sid:::  I did!
Ronnie Anne::: Oh,  Hope you didn't see me goof it up before.
Sid::: No, no, no, no, no, that was sweet. Can I try?
Ronnie Anne::: Sure! Always happy to share with a fellow skater. Here, this ramp opened up.  Alright, dude, show me what you got.
Sid:::  Woah! Woah!  Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
Ronnie Anne:::  Quick, grab on!
Sid::: Woah!  Oof.
Ronnie Anne:::  Are you okay?
Sid::: Not a scratch thanks to you.
Ronnie Anne::: Um, not to be rude but, have you skated before?
Sid:::  Nope, but it looked fun. I've never eaten a hot dog with all that extra junk on it either,  but I just moved here, and I wanna try every new thing I can!
Ronnie Anne:::  You're awesome! I'm Ronnie Anne Santiago. 
Sid::: I'm Sid Chang, nice to meet you.
Ronnie Anne::: Whoa, look at that little dude. He’s seen better days.
Sid::: Poor guy.  I still can’t believe you didn’t grow up here.
Ronnie Anne::: Nope, I’m from Royal Woods.
Sid::: Wow, you seem like such a city kid, what for the hot dogs for breakfast and all.
Ronnie Anne::: No, I only moved here a few months ago with my brother and my mom to be closer to family. My mom’s an ER nurse at the city hospital.
Sid::: Cool! What about your dad? Unless that’s like a sore subject. My grandma always says I’m too nosey.
Ronnie Anne::: No, no, no. You’re good. My parents are split up, but it’s no big. My dad’s a doctor who works with Physicians on Missions  He’s in Peru right now helping set up a new clinic.
Sid::: Whoa, is that a ring-tailed lemur?
Ronnie Anne::: Yeah, how’d you know?
Sid::: My mom brought one home from work once. She’s a zoologist. Here, that’s her.  And that’s my dad, who’s a subway conductor. And my sister, Adelaide, who’s like a professional little sass bucket.
Sid::: Crud, that’s my mom. I gotta go meet back up with them
Ronnie Anne::: I should probably get going too. But maybe we should, you know...
Sid:::  Hang out again as soon as possible?
Ronnie Anne::: Yeah! Number swap?
Ronnie Anne::: Put it on my tab, Bobby!
Bobby::: You don’t have a tab!
Ronnie Anne::: Sid?!
Ronnie Anne and Sid:::  What are you doing here!?
Ronnie Anne::: I live here.
Sid::: No way. I might too! My parents are applying for an apartment right now! I looked at it with them before going to the park.
Ronnie Anne::: Apartment 3A?  That’s right over me in 2A. We could be neighbors!
Sid::: You’re blowing my mind right now!  Ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh!
Sid and Ronnie Anne::: Ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh! Ooh-ah! Woo! 
Becca::: Thanks, Mrs. Casagrande. It was a pleasure meeting you and your grandchildren.  Hey kiddo, sorry we took so long. Ready to head back to the hotel?
Sid::: Yep.  See you later, neighbor.
Ronnie Anne::: Abuela, you have to give that family the apartment! I hung out with Sid at the park, and she’s awesome.
Rosa::: Mija, I don’t own the building, I just manage it. That decision is up to Mr. Scully, and he’s going to have a lot of applicants to choose from.
Ronnie Anne::: Oh...
Rosa::: Don’t worry, niña. I’ll put in a good word. I like them too.
CJ::: Come on Abuela, back to work. 
Rosa::: You're right, CJ! Vamos!
Ronnie Anne::: Guys, I have a favor to ask.  You know that family who just looked at the apartment? The Changs? They have to get it! I know that sounds crazy, but I just met this awesome girl Sid, and- 
Carlota::: Are you kidding?! We want them to get the apartment too!
Bobby::: Yeah! Carl and I met them when they came into the mercado. Did you know Mr. Chang is a subway driver?
Carl:::  Excuse you?! He is a conductor!  And he said he'll let me take the control sometime!
CJ::: And Mrs. Chang is taking me to the zoo! I'm going to feed the elephants!
Carlota::: And that adorable little Adelaide? Her parents are looking for a babysitter, hello second job!
Bobby::: I'm just happy to see you so excited about a new bud!  I know it's hard to make new friends in the city and I don't want you to be lonely.
Ronnie Anne:::  Come on, Bobby, don't get all cornball on me now.
CJ:::'  If you guys are done, I wanna hear the plan.
Ronnie Anne::: Thank you, CJ. It's simple. We just have to make sure no other potential tenants see the apartment. How does Abuela usually advertise it? Online post, email blast..?
Carl::: No way. Abuela's old school.
Carlota::: Yeah! She photocopies the same flyer she's used for ten years and puts it up all over the neighborhood.
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, so we have to take those flyers down and deal with the people who've already seen them, plus someone has to keep Abuela distracted.  Now who's with me?
Bobby, Carlota, Carl, and CJ:::  I am!
Carlota::: Abuela always puts a flyer up at Margarita's Salon.
Ronnie Anne::: Got it, let's- 
Hector::: Gracias, Margarita, for the trim, and the gossip. 
Ronnie Anne:::  Phew, that was close.
Carlota::: Ugh, I know!  Hey, you wanna get mani-pedis while we're here?  My treat.
Carl:::  Uh, you missed a spot. 
Bobby::: Oh, thanks. buddy. Uh-oh.
Carl::: I got this one.  Oh, you're here to see apartment 3A?  Great! The bed bug exterminator should be done any minute.  Uh, uh, uh, uh uh.
Male couple::: AHHHHH! 
Rosa::: Ay ay ay, I'm surprised no one's coming by! Last time we had a vacant apartment, it was a mob scene. 
CJ::: Wanna see my hammer?  It's also a screwdriver! 
Rosa:::  Mmmm, ohhh.. 
Ronnie Anne:::  Shhhh.. 
Carlitos:::  Shhhh...
Carlos:::  Oh, sorry.
Carlitos::: Shhhh...
Hipster Woman:::  Is that...police tape?  Is this a crime scene?
Hipster Man:::  I know we wanted edgy, but not that edgy!
Ronnie Anne::: Hey, guys! How did everything go today?
Bobby::: Perfect! We were able to keep every potential tenant from entering the building. How about you guys?
Carlota::: Great! We got every flyer in the neighborhood! And I've got the blisters to prove it. I chose the wrong day to break in these disco boots. 
Ronnie Anne::: You guys have been amazing, thank you so much!  I gotta go tell Sid about this!  Oh, hey Abuela and CJ, lot of people come to see the apartment today?
Rosa::: No mija, it's very strange! The Changs were the only ones who came by!  Oh well. I'll call Mr. Scully to let him know. 
Ronnie Anne:::  Hey, official new neighbor...
Rosa:::  Oh, hello, Mr. Scully! I was just about to call you!
Mr. Scully:::  Thanks for all your hard work today, Mrs. Casagrande! I was wondering if you could show the apartment one more time.
Ronnie Anne:::  Huh?
Mr. Scully::: I'm sending some potential tenants over in an hour. They're friends of mine. I think they'll be a great fit for the building.
Carlota::: Ugh! I can't believe another couple is coming to look at the apartment! So much for babysitting Sid's little sister, and right after I found out she and I are the same sign.
CJ::: Bye-bye elephants.
Carl:::  So much for going full throttle on the five o' clock express train.
Bobby:::  Aw, sorry, sis. I know how much you wanted to have Sid in the building.
Ronnie Anne::: Guys, we can't give up.
Carlota::: But these people are Mr. Scully's friends. If they like the apartment, they'll definitely get it.
Ronnie Anne:::  But what if they don't like it. Here's what I'm thinking:  Before they get here, we distract Abuela and make the apartment look like a total disaster.
Carlota::: That's great, but there's one tiny hole in your plan, Abuela's obviously gonna know what we did when she takes the couple up there.
Ronnie Anne::: No, she won't.
Bobby, Carlota, CJ, and Carl::: Huh?. Why?
Ronnie Anne::: Because she's not going to take them to see the apartment, I am.
Ronnie Anne::: Sid?
Sid::: Hey, how'd you like my bird call? it was an Amazon Kingfisher, perfect for secret missions.
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, do you do a lot of secret missions?
Sid:::  No, this is my first one, but I'm already getting the hang of it.  Guess my bird call was a little too good.
Ronnie Anne:::  Ha, come on, you nut. 
Carl::: 5, 4, 3, 2...
Rosa::: Are you hungry, mijito?
Carl::: Right on time. 
Rosa::: Let me whip you up a snack.
Carl:::  Thanks, Abuela, you're the best. 
Rosa::: That's my good boy.
Ronnie Anne::: Good dog.  Let's do this.
Sid:::  I can't believe this is going to be my hallway, and my door,  and this is going to be my living room,  and this is going to be my bedroom.
Ronnie Anne:::  Wait!,  you're right above my bedroom, we'll be able to talk any time we want.
Sid::: Ooh, cool, and there’s your dog. Hey, bud!
Ronnie Anne::: Lalo! Shhhh...
Sid::: I had a little leftover hot dog in my pocket.
Ronnie Anne::: Well, you just made a friend for life.  And now, back to the plan, let's get to work. 
Rosa::: Asi, muchacho, keep eating! And save room for flan.  I'm just going upstairs to do one last check of the apartment.
Sergio:::  Man down!  Carl's asleep!  Abuela's on the move!
Carlota::: Oh, no! I'm on it.  Abuela, wait!
Rosa::: What is it, mija?
Carlota::: Uh, I just, uh... can you do a fortune telling for me?
Rosa::: I'm happy to do it later, but right now, I'm busy.
Carlota::: But, it's urgent! There's, uh, a really cute barista at the coffee shop and I don't know if I should ask him out before Kinsey Beckwith swoops in.
Rosa:::  That is urgent! Let me get my cards and tea leaves and we'll see if this boy is worthy of you.  Have a seat, next to your hermano, I'll be right back.
Ronnie Anne::: I think we nailed it.
Sid::: Yeah, nice brush work, you're almost making me not wanna live here.
Ronnie Anne::: A-thank you, how'd the gluing go?
Sid::: Great, these windows aren't closing anytime soon.
Ronnie Anne::: Yup, I think our work here is almost done, just one more thing.
Sid:::  Woah, what is that smell? 
Ronnie Anne::: My secret weapon; a secret blend of expired cheese, Bobby's work shoes, and to top it off, Lalo's fart pillow. 
Sid::: Dang, girl! What's next?
Ronnie Anne::: We hide these around the apartment.
Sid::: And then?
Ronnie Anne::: You go back to your hotel.
Sid::: And then?
Ronnie Anne::: I’ll signal you when the mission is complete.
Sid::: Ooh, which bird call are you going to use? The Plum-throated cotinga?  Just text me!
CJ:::  Shhh. This is a secret mission. I'm going up, Ronnie Anne.
Ronnie Anne::: Great job, CJ!
CJ::: Shh! Secret mission.
Ronnie Anne::: Right, sorry, CJ. 
CJ::: Hi, Mrs. Kernicky!
Mrs. Kernicky::: CJ, my favorite neighbor! Come in, I just baked some cookies!
Rosa::: The cards do not lie, mija. This barista boy is a punk! You can do better. Let Kinsey have him.
Ronnie Anne::: I love you, Abuela! 
Rosa::: Yes, yes, that's nice, mi angelita. I love you, too.  Oh, that must be Mr. Scully's friends, the Reynolds!
Carl::: What now? We can't let Abuela go upstairs!
Ronnie Anne::: Don't worry. We planned for this.
Carl::: Oh, good, good. I should've known you guys were on it.
Carlota::: Oh, no! Carl, your forehead is warm. Are you getting sick?
Rosa::: Sick? Who's Sick? Carl's Sick?
Carl:::  How could you?
Rosa::: Pobrecito, are you ill?  Ah, I told you not to touch the subway handrails, but don't worry, I have remedies to cure everything.
Carl:::  Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.
Rosa:::  Mija, you have to show the Reynolds the apartment, I'll start warming up the bone broth.
Carl:::  I will not forget this betrayal!  If I survive.
Ronnie Anne::: Okay. Here we go.
Mrs. Reynolds::: It's nice to meet you, Ronnie Anne. We're so excited to see the apartment!
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, it's the best unit in the building.  You're going to love it, Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds.
Ronnie Anne::: So, as you can see, it's really bright and open and airy.
Mr. Reynolds::: Goodness.  There seems to be a lot of cracks in the walls.
Ronnie Anne::: You can hang a few pictures and who's gonna notice, am I right?  Your upstairs neighbor is a professional clog dancer.
CJ::: And that's how you do the CJ shuffle.
Mrs. Kernicky::: Wonderful! You're very talented CJ. Another cookie?
CJ::: Don't mind if I do.
Mrs. Reynolds::: Ugh! What is that smell?
Ronnie Anne::: Great question, no one really knows, it's a fun mystery the whole building’s been trying to solve. My money's on a forgotten crab cake, or rockfish. Ever had rockfish.  Ah, the excitement of the city. Don't you love it?
Mr. Reynolds::: Maybe we should close some windows.  This one is stuck.
Mrs. Reynolds:::  So is this one, it's almost like it was glued open.
Ronnie Anne:::  You're funny, no those windows have been stuck for years, but it's great, you get plenty of natural light... and rain... and snow.  I forgot to ask. You guys like animals? This neighborhood is full of friendly critters.  Come on, I'll show you the bedrooms, one's right over the dumpster, which makes trash day a breeze.
Mr. Reynolds:::  Actually, I think we've seen enough.
Ronnie Anne:::  What?
Mrs. Reynolds:::  Thank you for showing us the apartment, but we're not going to take it.
Ronnie Anne:::  Oh, that's too bad, I really thought you'd like it. Well, good luck finding a place.
Mr. Reynolds::: Is this bird poop?
Rosa:::  Did I miss the Reynolds? I have an applications for them to fill out.
Ronnie Anne::: No need Abuela, they decided not to take the apartment, they uh, wanted a place with an elevator.
Sid::: Of course CJ, I'm sure my Mom would let you help give the elephants a bath, and Carl, my Dad will give you a tour of the abandoned subway tunnels.
Ronnie Anne:::  To our new neighbors, the Changs.
Carlota, Bobby, Carl, & CJ::: To the Changs.
Hector:::  Rosa, Mr. Scully is here to see you.
Ronnie Anne::: Huh? What's he doing here?
Rosa::: Oh, hello Mr. Scully.
Mr Scully::: Hello Mrs. Casagrande, uh, I was surprised to hear that the Reynolds aren't taking the apartment.
Rosa::: So was I, and just because we don't have an elevator.
Mr. Scully:::  No, they said the apartment was a disaster,  I thought you were taking better care of it. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to fire you.
Rosa::: No, Mr. Scully, come, come,  I'll show you the apartment.  I don't understand what the Reynolds are talking about, you'll see how nice the apartment is, new windows, new paint, everything.
Mr. Scully:::  Wha! The! How do you explain this?
Rosa:::  I, I, I can't.
Ronnie Anne:::  I can, this was all my doing,  I made the place look terrible so the Reynolds wouldn't want it.
Rosa::: But why would you do that?
Ronnie Anne:::  Because I wanted the Changs to live here, Sid and I really hit it off and, I thought we could be friends, maybe even best friends, Mr. Scully, I'm really really sorry, please don't fire Abuela, she's a great manager, this is all on me.
Maria::: Ronnie Anne!
Sergio:::  Double trouble. 
Maria::: Your Abuela told me what you did, and I'm very disappointed.  But, we did get some good news.
Rosa:::  Mr. Scully said, I can keep my job.
Ronnie Anne::: Oh my gosh, that's great, I'm so sorry about what I did.
Rosa::: I know mija, and I appreciate that you took responsibility for it.  Awe, mi nieta.
Ronnie Anne::: So, the Reynolds are taking the apartment?
Rosa::: Si.
Maria:::  Once you're done repairing it.
Ronnie Anne::: Last one, all done,  Thanks for the assist Sergio.
Sergio:::  You can pay me in crackers.
Rosa:::  The apartment looks good mija, I'm impressed. Why don't you come downstairs and help me welcome the new tenants?
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, I owe the Reynolds an apology anyway.  Oh, hi Mr. Scully, the apartment is all ready, I know the Reynolds are going to be very happy here.
Mr. Scully::: Thank you Ronnie Anne, I really appreciate it, and I'm sure the new tenants will too.
Sid::: Oh yoo-hoo! Ca-ca-ca-ca-caw.  Oh, yoo-hoo!
Ronnie Anne::: What the what?! Sid?
Sid::: Hey neighbor!
Ronnie Anne::: But, wait, I don't understand.
Mr. Scully::: Ronnie Anne, what you said about having a best friend really touched me; I got to live next door to my, 'BFF' when I was a kid, and I know how special that is, so I found the Reynolds an apartment in another one of my buildings, and told the Changs they could have this one.
Ronnie Anne::: Thank you, thank you! Thank you!
Mr. Scully:::  Now have fun you, BFFs.
Ronnie Anne & Sid::: Yes sir, Mr. Scully.
Ronnie Anne::: Being neighbors is gonna be awesome!
Sid::: I know!  We can have sleepovers, all the time, and eat hot dogs for breakfast, everyday.
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, and wait 'til you see the view from the roof.
Sid::: Wait 'til you meet Cheesecake.
Ronnie Anne::: Who's that?
Sid::: He's an albino gorilla my mom rescued from the Congo, and he's really good at karaoke.
Ronnie Anne:::  This just keeps getting better.
