Loud kids:::  They're here!
Lincoln:::  It's a big night at the Loud House. Pop-Pop's coming to dinner and he's bringing a very special guest!
Albert::: Hey, family, I'd like you all to meet my main squeeze,  Myrtle.
Rita::: Nice to meet you, Myrtle! Let me introduce everyone.
Myrtle::: Oh, no need. Let's see if I have this right: Lori, Leni, Luna, Luan, Lynn, Lincoln, Lucy, Lana, Lola, Lisa and Lily.
Lynn Sr.:::  Wow, in birth order! That's impressive.
Myrtle::: Well, what's impressive is raising such delightful children. Albert, can you take my coat?
Myrtle::: Lynn, your food is just heavenly!
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, you're sweet to say that.
Myrtle::: Not as sweet as this corn! 
Luan:::  I can't have any, because I have braces.
Myrtle::: Well, the world better brace itself for your pretty smile.
Myrtle::: Oh, Lynn Jr., are those your trophies? Pop-Pop said you were named MVP on six different teams!
Lynn::: Well, technically seven but they don't recognize air hockey yet.
Lisa::: Has my paternal forebearer familiarized you with my achievements?
Myrtle::: Oh, you bet. He told me all about your fecal research. Impressive stuff.
Lisa::: Would you like to see some slides?
Rita::: Maybe after dinner, sweetie.
Lincoln::: So this is Ace Savvy, and here's his partner, One-Eyed Jack.
Myrtle::: Card puns? How clever!
Albert::: Sorry to break up the fun, but Myrtle and I should get going.
Loud Kids::: Aww!
Myrtle::: I'm sorry I didn't get to sample your mud pies, Lana.
Lana::: It's OK, made you one for the road.  Don't forget to heat before serving.
Myrtle::: Thank you for everything. Oh, it was so wonderful meeting you all.
Lori::: Come back soon.
Myrtle:::  I might just take you up on that.
Albert::: Isn't she great? Good thing I stole her away from Seymour.  That hound dog had his eye on her.
Myrtle::: Yeah, his left one. Buh-bye!
Lisa::: Myrtle, wait! My fecal slides!
Louds::: AAAH!
Myrtle::: Oh, hi fam! I found your hide-a-key!
Luna:::  Uh, wasn't it under the thorn bushes?
Myrtle::: Also, I found your bandages.  I just couldn't wait to get back over here and spend some more time with my 11 new grandkids. Speaking of which...  SURPRISE!  I made these with my glue gun.
Lisa:::  'Life is sweeter with a Gran-Gran'? Was your room well-ventilated when you worked with this glue?
Myrtle::: I was thinking that maybe you kids could call me Gran-Gran!  Why don't you try 'em on? 
Myrtle:::  Aww! You look so cute! Now come on, I have even more surprises!
Lucy:::  What have you done with my cobwebs?
Myrtle::: Oh, sweetie. I tore them all down because they had spiders in them!
Lucy::: Yes, Elijah, Amaria, and Little Jojo. May they rest in peace.
Lynn::: Uh, where are my lucky jerseys? They should be in a big messy pile right here.
Myrtle::: I took 'em to the dry cleaners. They got every last stain out.
Lynn:::  Oh. So everything that made them lucky.
Myrtle:::  Well, who needs luck when you have talent like-- yours?! 
Lisa::: In conclusion, I have identified the necessary isotope for the-
Myrtle::: Aww. You're talking to your little science friends? Hi, I'm Lisa's Gran-Gran.
Lisa::: Yes. We're in the middle of something important right now. Perhaps you could excuse us?
Myrtle::: Oh, you know what, you just do your thing like I'm not even here, and I'll just be tidying up!
Lisa:::  I prefer you don't!
Myrtle::: Ooh, these beakers are full of junk!
Lisa:::  NO, WAIT! 
Lincoln::: I usually have a barber do this.
Myrtle::: Well, why pay a stranger when you've got a Gran-Gran? There, Ah!  You look so handsome!
Luan::: That haircut really bowls me over! 
Myrtle::: Spit shine!  Ah, there. No mud, no make-up, just sparkling faces that I could eat right now with some steak sauce.  Om-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.
Lori::: Um, what happened to our episodes of Nail Polish Wars?
Myrtle::: Oh, I deleted those. Yeah, see, the language is just so negative.
Myrtle:::  Adios, grandbabies! See you real soon! 
Lucy::: That woman is a nightmare.
Lynn::: No way I'm calling her Gran-Gran.
Lola::: It gets worse! Look, she left her day planner.
Lynn:::  She's coming to all my games for the rest of the season?!
Lisa::: My conference in Sweden?! How did she get clearance?!
Lori::: She's coming on my next date with Bobby?!
Lincoln::: We have to do something. We can't live like this!
Luna:::  You especially can't, brah. 
Lola::: Well, there is one thing we could do: Break them up.
Lana::: Lola!
Leni::: That's terrible!
Luan::: Is it though? I mean, Pop-Pop is such an awesome guy! Should he really settle for someone like Myrtle?
Lisa::: She has a point.
Lori::: Well, even if we wanted to do that, how would we?
Lincoln::: I might have an idea. Remember when Pop-Pop said that Seymour had his eye on Myrtle?
Lana::: Yeah, the left one.
Lincoln::: Maybe that's our answer!
Luan::: I made this whole pitcher of lemonade for my grandpa, but he's got acid reflux. Whatever shall I do with it?
Seymour::: Ooh! I'll take a glass! 
Luan::: Here you are, Mr. Seymour, sir!
Seymour:::  Ooh, tart! 
Lori:::  Oh, my soup's literally too hot! How am I ever going to eat it?
Myrtle::: Oh, let me help, dear. 
Lincoln::: And now to make a love connection.  Bingo.
Leni::: Um, Lincoln, Bingo's not 'till 4:00.
Luna::: Rad job, dude. That's gonna make Pop-Pop way jealous!
Lola::: I bet he breaks it off with her tonight.
Lincoln:::  OK, Lynn, you're up.
Lana:::  Man, what's taking Lynn so long?
Lynn:::  Hi!  Mission accomplished.
Lori::: OK. Let's get out of here before anyone sees us.
Myrtle:::  Too late!  I see you!
Siblings:::  AAH!
Myrtle:::  Oh, you angels came for my birthday party, didn't you?
Siblings::: Uh... Of course! Yeah. Uh-huh!
Myrtle::: Well, here we are, Party Central! As soon as your Pop-Pop gets here, we can get this shindig started.
Lincoln:::  Shouldn't we wait for the other guests, too?
Myrtle:::  Oh, no other guests.
Luan:::  What about your family?
Myrtle::: Well, I don't really have any. I was an only child and somehow, I never got around to getting hitched. I was just too busy traveling and living my life. And to be honest, I never really missed having a family, until I met your Pop-Pop and you guys, and, well, I know you're not my real family, but gosh darn, you all sure feel like it.
Lori:::  Um, Myrtle, can you excuse us for a second? We, um, all have to go to the bathroom.
Myrtle:::  You take after your Pop-Pop.
Lola:::  OK, what gives, Lori? I don't have to tinkle!
Lori::: Don't you guys get it? This is why Myrtle's been smothering us so much. She never had a family of her own. She's probably just trying to make up for lost time! Yes, she can come on a little strong, but her heart's in the right place.
Lucy::: I feel terrible.
Lana::: Me too.
Luan::: We should go apologize.
Lincoln::: Uh, guys, we have a bigger problem. We put that photo under Pop-Pop's door.
Siblings:::  Aah!
Lori::: OK, new plan. Twins, you distract Myrtle. Lynn and Lincoln, you get the photo back. The rest of us will find Pop-Pop and keep him away from his room. Break!
Lynn::: Let's move out, Lincoln!
Lincoln:::  Hey, when did you change into your ninja suit?
Lynn:::  What happened to your bowl cut?
Lincoln::: Touch√©.
Lynn::: Hai!
Lincoln::: Woah! Ooh.
Lynn:::  Locked. Not a problem. I got this.  Hoa,  Ah!  Thanks, lady.
Lincoln::: Oh no, he's already seen it!
Seymour:::  Help! Someone call this maniac off!
Albert::: I knew you had your eye on my girl!
Seymour::: That's not true. The left one's got a mind of its own.
Albert::: Pictures don't lie, Seymour!  And now I'm gonna take it to ya!
Seymour::: You're a crazy man!
Albert::: Ya!
Lincoln:::  Pop-Pop, stop!
Albert::: Stay out of this, kids! Mr. Kissy Face has it coming.  Rah!
Seymour::: Dang it.
Lincoln and Lynn::: Pop-Pop!
Lincoln::: Let him go!
Lynn::: Let him go!
Lori::: What is going on?
Lori, Luna, Lana and Lola:::  Pop-Pop!
Seymour::: Call Sue! Call anybody!
Scoots:::  Geezer fight! I got 50 bucks on Al!
Albert:::  Ha!
Lincoln:::  Pop-Pop, no! The photo's fake!
Albert:::  What?
Lana::: It's true. We made it on our computer!
Albert::: Why in the heck would you do something like that?
Lori::: The truth is, we were trying to break you and Myrtle up.
Albert::: Don't you like Myrtle?
Luna::: I think we just didn't understand her!
Luan::: She was smothering us like a pork chop. But we didn't realize it was because she never had a family!
Lana::: We may take it for granted that we have a big family, but not everybody's so lucky!
Lincoln::: We're really sorry for the way we acted. We hope you can forgive us.
Albert::: Of course I can. I know Myrtle can be a bit much, but that's also what I love about her. She's a spitfire.
Scoots::: Ugh, Bleh, this is gettin' too mushy for me. Scoots out! 
Albert::: Seymour, I think I owe you an apology too.
Seymour::: Nah, don't worry about it, Al.
Lori::: Don't we have a birthday party to get to?
Albert::: You know it!
Seymour::: Can I come too?
Albert::: You're gonna have to, Seymour. I can't move my arms anymore!
Siblings::: Happy birthday, Gran-Gran!
Myrtle:::  Did you hear that, Al? They called me Gran-Gran! Oh, thank you, everyone.
Lori::: Thanks for the cake and the party, Gran-Gran. But we should probably get going.
Myrtle::: Okay, then, I'll drop by tomorrow.
Albert::: Uh...how about Sunday instead? I got us tickets to the RV show tomorrow.
Myrtle::: Oh! 
Siblings::: Bye, Gran-Gran! 
Scoots::: Seymour, quit eyein' my cake! You already had your piece!
Seymour::: I can't help it. The left one's got a mind of its own!
