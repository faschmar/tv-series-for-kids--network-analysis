Sully::: Rock 'n roll!
Sam::: Whoo-hoo! It's time to get our jam on! 
Luna::: I can't wait to show you guys this new track I've been working on. 
Sully::: Hey, what's that? Someone's selling their gear? 
Luna::: No, it looks like a note from Principal Rivers.  Due to recent budget cuts, the Music Club has been... CANCELLED?! 
All::: WHAT?! 
Luna::: How can she cancel the Music Club?  
Sam::: Doesn't she know how much it means to us? 
Sully::: There must be some mistake. 
Mazzy::: Wait! That's our drum! 
Luna::: Dudes, we gotta stop this! 
Music Club::: We wanna rock! We wanna roll! Music Club's our heart and soul! 
Oliver::: Eh, Principal Rivers, you might wanna see this. 
Principal Rivers::: Hang on. I can't decide between the maple glazed or the bear claw. Ooh!  Oh, yeah, grr, bear claw.  
Music Club:::  We wanna rock! 
Principal Rivers::: Hmm? 
Music Club::: We wanna roll! Music Club's our heart and soul! 
Principal Rivers:::  Oh no! Are those the music kids? Oh, they seem really mad at me, maybe I shouldn't have cut their club. 
Oliver::: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't panic, you spent weeks making the new budget, stand firm! 
Principal Rivers::: Mmm, right! 
Luna:::  Principal Rivers!  We're not giving up our club without a fight! 
Sam::: So listen up, cause this song's going out to you! 
Oliver::: It's a catchy song, but you've already made up your mind. Right, Principal Rivers?  Pri-pri-principal Rivers?
Principal Rivers:::  I say, I say,  I say we save the music, it's up to me cause I'm the principal, oh yeah.
Luna:::  When the last bell ri-
Lori:::  Well, I guess I can give these golf clubs back to Pop-Pop, cause I literally don't need them anymore!
Luna::: Dude, what are you talking about?
Lori::: Thanks to your little protest, Principal Rivers cut all of the school sports clubs, including golf. How could you do this to me?
Luan:::  Uh, we should go.
Mr. Coconuts:::  Ah, come on toots, it's just gettin' good.
Luna:::  Listen, I'm sorry for your loss dude, but don't rage out at me, I was just trying to save my music club.
Mr. Coconuts::: Ten bucks on the short one.
Lincoln::: Umm, guys.
Lori & Luna:::  WHAT, LINCOLN?!
Lincoln::: I just wanted to let you know that dinner is ready.  Okay then, I'll look forward to seeing you there.
Oliver::: Okay now Principal Rivers, concentrate. Do you want the Cobb salad, or the vegan sloppy joes for lunch?
Principal Rivers::: Ah, they both sound so good, um... Cobb salad.
Oliver:::  Cobb salad.
Principal Rivers::: No wait, sloppy joes.  No salad, no, uh, sloppy joes... over salad, oh, wait, that might make the lettuce warm.
Student::: Save!  Our!  Sports!
Lori::: Principal Rivers! You can't cut the sports club! We could literally go on all day about everything it's taught us! Or, we could just, show you!
Principal Rivers::: Wow, these kids are amazing.
Oliver::: Yup, but you've already made your decision,  you're holding your ground. Right?  Uh, right?  Oh, come on.
Principal Rivers:::  Give me a boost.
Oliver:::  Huh?
Principal Rivers::: I'll find cuts somewhere else, sports are here to stay.
Luan:::  Thanks a lot Lori! The theater club is getting cut and it's all your fault!
Lori::: What? How is that my fault?
Luna::: Woah dudes, what's with all the negative energy in here? Everybody chill.
Luan:::  Don't tell me to chill, hippie, I'm not happy with you either. Because of your little protests, Principal Rivers decided to cut the Theater Club, and we were just about to stage our six hour Hamlet.
Lori:::  I'm sorry about your club, but I just did what I had to do to save mine.
Luna:::  Samesies.
Lincoln:::  Hey guys, dinnertime. Tonight, Chef Lynn has prepared his signature spicy tuna casseroooole...-  -kay, I'm just gonna go.
Principal Rivers:::  Work. Work. Work.
Mr. Coconuts:::  Ladies and gents, please take your seats. It's almost showtime.
Principal Rivers::: Showtime?
Luan::: Thank you, thank you. We now present: A World Without Theater Club.  So thirsty, for self expression.
Mr. Coconuts::: So hungry, for creativity.
Oliver::: Principal Rivers!
Principal Rivers::: It's... so... good.
Oliver::: No... you... don't.  You already made up your mind.
Luan::: So deprived, of joy.
Mr. Coconuts::: Why even go on, Toots?
Principal Rivers::: Ah, bravo, bravo, so moving.  Your passion has changed my mind. The theater club is here to stay! 
Lori::: Congrats on your win, Luan.
Luna::: Yeah, way to go dude!
Luan::: Thank you, thank you. Sorry Mr. C. and I got a little uh, testy with you.
Luna::: Awe, it's all good, we get it dude.
Lori::: Yeah, and what matters now is that literally, all of our clubs are safe.
Oliver::: I'm sorry Principal Rivers, but the final budget is due Monday! You've got to cut one of our three most expensive clubs; theater, music, or sports.
Principal Rivers::: But which one?  Why is being a principal so hard?
Oliver::: You have to choose.
Luna::: Someone has to be the loser, and it's not gonna be us! 
Sam, Sully, and Mazzy:::  Music!
Lori::: Those other clubs are so going down! 
Sports Club:::  Sports!
Luan::: It's time to upstage those turkeys! 
Theater Club:::  Theater!
Everyone::: Save our music! Save out theater! Save out sports!
Principal Rivers::: Oh dear.
Mr. Coconuts::: Theater you goons.  Hey! Watch it meathead!
Spencer:::  Hey! Why are you drama kids even here? The only thing your plays are good for, is putting people to sleep!
Sports Club::: Ooh!
Ruby::: Wanna know what puts me to sleep? Watching you like, pointlessly chase a ball around all day.
Theater Club::: Oh!
Spencer::: What!?
Mazzy::: Yeah! And when was the last time you guys even won a game?
Lori:::  Well, maybe we would be able to concentrate better if it wasn't for all that racket, COMING FROM THE BAND ROOM!
Luna:::  That does it, you guys are going down! 
Sports Club:::  Let's get em!
Sam, Sully, & Mazzy:::  Fight!
Lori:::  Don't worry, I'll protect you, Sports Club!
Luan::: Whooooa, booooy!
Principal Rivers::: Let's see: Broken wall...
Oliver::: Cracked historical acorn statue...
Principal Rivers::: Double door replacement.  What do you got?  Yeah, that's bad.
Oliver:::  Principal Rivers, you know what to do.
Principal Rivers::: Dah, I can't.
Oliver:::  You, must.
Principal Rivers::: Ah.  There's only one way to cover all this damage guys. I'm gonna have to cut, all the school clubs.
Lori::: All of them?
Principal Rivers::: Yup, Cooking Club, Origami Club, Squirrel Feeding Club.  Everything
Luan::: Oh, I have friends in those clubs.
Lori:::  So do I.
Luna:::  Me too, man.
Lori::: Principal Rivers, forget our three clubs. We got what we deserved, but you can't cut the rest of them. This is literally our fault, not theirs!
Principal Rivers::: But how else am I gonna pay for the repair?
Luna:::  Dudes and dudettes, thanks for coming out to support our school! Let the fund rager begin!
Spencer::: Step right up, and learn to golf like a pro.
Lori::: Okay Mr. G. remember; focus, follow-through, and when you're ready just tap her in.
Mr. Grouse::: Ah, like this?  Whoops.
Ruby::: Ever wanted to be a star on stage? For like, a small donation, you totally can.
Flip::: But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
Luan:::  Wow Flip, I didn't know you had it in you.
Flip::: What? You think all Flip can do is sell jerky?
Mr. Coconuts::: Hey, don't forget your donation pal.
Luna::: You ready to learn how to shred? Why don't we start with the basics?
Scoots:::  Forget basics. Rock and roll!
Principal Rivers::: Way to go girls! Thanks to all your hard work we've raised enough money to fix the school and save your friend's clubs!
Luan::: Wow, what a relief.
Luna::: That is all we cared about.
Mazzy:::  Wait, you didn't count everything.
Principal Rivers::: This is amazing! It looks like we have enough to keep all the clubs!
Luna::: Dudes, this calls for an encore.
