Lisa:::  And that's why I propose we cryogenically freeze Luan for April Fool's Day. She can't prank us if she's frozen solid.  Oh, come on! She'll maintain brain function. Well, a little.
Lola::: Lana and I have an idea.
Lola::: We call it the Prank-Me-Not Poncho.  The inflatable lining cushions you from all manner of pranks.
Lincoln::: Ow!  Ooh! Ow! I can feel that!
Lola::: Not a problem. We just need a little more air.
Lori::: Does anyone have an idea that will actually work? April Fool's Day is this weekend, and I am not losing another eyebrow.  They're starting to grow in coarse.
Luna::: I say we post bad reviews of Fanny's Prank Emporium, and force them out of business!
Lynn::: Ooh, that's good. We eliminate her supplier, we eliminate the problem.
Lincoln::: We're too late for that. Luan got her prank supplies shipped to an offshore warehouse months ago.  She told me that to scare me. It totally worked.
Lori:::  Leni, are you even paying attention?
Leni::: Oh, sorry. I was just reading this ad for a clown camp that takes place over April Fool's Day weekend. 
Leni's Siblings:::  WHAT?!
Lincoln:::  This is perfect! If we send Luan to this camp, she'll be two states away from us.  Oh, but it costs 500 bucks.
Rita::: Well, that is a lot of money, but if it means we don't have to spend April Fool's in these suits, I'd say it's worth it.
Luan:::  A weekend at Funny Farm's Clown Camp? Oh, this is my dream come true! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! But what's the occasion?
Lynn Sr.::: Why do we need an occasion to spoil our favorite little comedienne, huh?
Luan:::  Oh, wait. It's on April Fool's weekend.
Luan::: I don't know if I can be away from my family on my favorite holiday.
Lynn::: Ah, but think about all that fresh meat at the camp just waiting to be pranked.
Luan:::  Oh, you're right! Well, in that case, I camp wait!  Get it?
Lincoln:::  That is hilarious! Where do you come up with this stuff? Oh, I swear, I'm gonna pee.
Lucy::: Lincoln, don't oversell it.
Luan::: Well, guys, this is it. I'm really gonna miss you, but-
Luan::: Wait, wait! I changed my mind!
Luna:::  PUNCH IT, DAD!
Luan:::  I want the blue clown shoes, not the pink ones.
Lynn:::  Here, take them all!
Leni:::  Take mine, too, just to be safe!
Lynn Sr.::: Ah, dang it. Sorry, guys. Looks like Vanzilla just died on us.
Lana::: I'm on it, Dad!  Huh, that's weird. I thought I packed my toolbox.
Lynn Sr.::: It's okay, sweetie. We'll just get a tow in the morning. There's a motel right there.
Lola:::  Lola Loud does not stay in two-star motels!
Rita:::  Well, there you go. Now it's a one-star, so you're good.
Lana:::  And please watch over Cliff, Charles, Geo, and Walt, and Izzy, Hops, Bitey, Fangs, El Diablo-
Lori:::  Lana!
Lana::: But I didn't get to my ant colony yet.
Lori::: Good night!
Lincoln:::  Seriously? That's not bothering anyone else?
Lynn:::  Oh, my bad. Those gas station burritos always get me going.
Lincoln::: Not that, the cricket. 
Lisa::: Ouch!
Luna::: Seriously, dude?!
Lincoln::: I'm sorry. I can't see anything. Let me just turn on a light. 
Sisters and Parents:::  LINCOLN!!!
Lincoln::: Sorry. 
Lynn Sr.:::  Lincoln!  Oh!
Lincoln::: I'm sorry! I can't figure out how anything works in here!
Rita::: Lincoln, stop hitting switches! You're making things worse!  Now, where is the dang plug for this thing?  Ow!
Leni::: I'll get some more towels to clean up that coffee! 
Lana::: Well, that should do it. Whoever wired this place had no idea what they were doing. 
Lincoln:::  I think they knew exactly what they were doing. Look what I found.  This cricket is a fake! It's from Fanny's Prank Emporium!
Lori::: That's where Luan gets all her pranking supplies!
Lynn:::  You don't think she's behind this, do you?
Rita:::  She can't be. She's at camp. I'll call her right now. 
Luan Voicemail::: Hello, family. I hope you're enjoying your stay. Buckle up. There's mo-telling what's gonna happen next.  Get it?
Lynn Sr.::: Okay, everybody stay calm. We'll just go to the manager and get a new room.
Lisa:::  How do we know that's not exactly what Luan wants us to do? I vote we stay put.
Lincoln::: Hang on, Lisa! We'll get you out!
Lisa:::  Negative! Proceed without me. I'm safer in here.
Lynn Sr.::: Let's go.
Lisa:::  LINCOLN! THE CRICKET!
Lincoln::: Ah! She cut the floorboards!
Lynn:::  Luna, grab my foot! I'll pull you to safety with my quads!
Luna:::  I can't, dude! Major gelatin hands! I'm cool here! Carry on, my wayward sons! 
Family:::  DIBS NOT!
Leni::: Dang it! I always do it wrong.
Leni::: You guys go on without me! I'd rather be stuck up here than get pranked by Luan!
Lynn Sr.::: Good evening, sir. We need a new room.
Manager::: Fine. You can have 1A. 
Lola:::  Princesses first!
Lola:::  The rat skunked me. 
Lana:::  The real 1A's over there.  Don't touch that handle! Remember what happened to Leni.
Leni:::  Hi, you guys! 
Lana::: I have an idea.  CHARGE!  I'm okay! I landed in pie!  And of course, she made it rhubarb pie, which I'm allergic to.
Lori:::  I can't take this anymore! I'm getting out of here!  MY EYEBROWS!
Rita::: Lily, no! It could be a trap!  Oh, chute!  I'm trapped! Save yourselves!
Lynn Sr.::: Come on, kids! Say goodbye to your mother!
Lucy:::  Please tell me this is not bleach.  And it's bleach. Go on without me. I don't wanna be seen in public like this.
Lynn Sr.::: Now, I know we're dropping like flies here. But let's not lose hope. If we stick together, we should be okay.
Lynn Sr.::: Lynn Jr., why don't you grab the Lilster, and we'll find a safer spot to hide.
Lincoln:::  The roof is next? What does that mean? And why did you just look at your arm?
Lincoln::: Room 2C, Hallway, Lobby, Room 1A, Laundry Room? These are all the places we got pranked!  You've been helping her!
Lynn Sr.::: Okay, I admit it!  I've been on Luan's scheme the whole time. A few weeks ago, she came to me...
Lincoln:::  Dad, how could you sell out your own family like that?
Lincoln:::  I hope it was worth it.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, it was not worth it. I feel terrible! What kind of father am I? What kind of...  ...husband? 
Lincoln:::  It's okay, Dad. You're not the bad guy here. Luan is.
Lynn Sr.::: No, no, son. I'm just as guilty. I went along with her!  But...maybe it's not too late to redeem myself. What do you think of putting Operation Find Our Family and Get Back at Luan for Causing Years of Emotional Damage and Also Think of a Shorter Name for This Operation into action?
Lincoln:::  I'm in!
Luan::: My pranking is about to reach new heights!  Get it?  Oh. There's no one here.
Luan:::  Uh...I'll be right there.  This is what I get for hiring an amateur.  That should do it.
Luan::: Whoa!
Luan:::  Clap, clap, clap. Well done, family. You got me. You may have won this time, but next year, I'm gonna stop going easy on you and give you all an April Fool's you'll never forget! ESPECIALLY YOU, DAD! 
Lynn Sr:::  WHAT HAVE I DONE?!
