<!--Episode Title::: Eye Can't-->
Lynn Sr.::: We are getting so good at that.
Lisa::: Good morn--  When did we put the trash can here?
Rita::: Honey, that's Charles.
Lisa:::  Ah, yes, of course. Hm.  Ah, here's the orange juice I was looking for. 
Rita:::  Have you noticed Lisa has been acting a little off this week?
Flashback Lisa::: Pardon me, Father.
Flashback Lisa::: Good boy, Cliff. Good boy.
Flashback Leni::: Uh, Lisa, that's not Cliff.
Lynn Sr.::: Yeah, she needs new glasses.
Lisa::: Ah, silly me, I mistook a vase of flowers for orange juice.  Ah! Here's the actual orange juice.
Lynn Sr.::: That's hot coffee!  Sweetie, look, Mom and I think it's time for you to go to the eye doctor.
Lisa::: What? Poppycock! Now if you'll excuse me, I shall be in the living room.  Ahh! Augh!  I'm okay. Mother's cacti garden broke my fall.  Hmm. When did we move all these cacti inside?
Todd::: What is the problem? It's just the eye doctor.
Lisa:::  The problem, Todd, is that I have an irrational phobia of the ophthalmologist.
Todd::: But that does not compute. You are a genius.
Lisa::: I said it was irrational, Todd. And I've tried to train myself to move past it, but I can't.
Boris::: Now, just a puff of air. 
Lisa::: No! Not the--ahhhh! 
Todd::: Why don't you do the exam and make new glasses yourself?
Lisa:::  Todd, you beautiful piece of robotic machinery, that's a great idea.
Lisa::: Hmm. Mm...hmm. 
Todd::: How is it looking?
Lisa:::  Well, it's not perfect, but I'd say it gets the job done.  Now can you give me a little space? You're way too close, Todd.
Todd:::  Right.
Lisa::: Now let's show Mother and Father.  Ugh. Problem solved, parents.  I've forged myself a new pair of glasses, and all is well. 
Lynn Sr.::: Counterpoint, you did kinda just fall down the stairs.
Lisa::: Eh. You say tomato, I say mildly near-sighted.
Rita::: And I say tomorrow morning you are going to the eye doctor, and, maybe the pediatrician too to see if you have any damage from that fall.
Lisa:::  Fine.
Lynn Sr.::: Lisa, thank you for being so mature about this.
Lisa:::  Oh dear. Father, this is what happens when you neglect your vehicle.  Shame.  Oh well, I guess we can't go.  Oh! 
Lynn Sr.:::  So that's how it's gonna be, huh? Well, too bad you didn't think of this, you little genius.  Mr. Grouse? Five Lynn-sagnas to borrow your car. Ha-ha-ha.  Okay, ten, but no extra sauce.
Rita::: Ohh. Chicken bones?
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, yeah, honey, uh, Grouse said not to mess with those. He chews on 'em at stoplights to get the last of the meat off.
Lisa::: Yeah, thank you Santa, for the nifty satellite set.  Now let's just hack into the Royal Woods transportation grid and create a little traffic, shall we? 
Lynn Sr.:::  Dang it! Where did all this traffic come from?  We're never gonna make the appointment now.
Rita:::  I know a shortcut. Turn here.
Lynn Sr.::: Hang on!
Rita::: See? I go this way all the time.
Lynn Sr.::: Really? 'Cause I don't think that was a road, hon.
Lisa::: Hmm, perhaps some precipitation will slow us down.  A little cloud seeding and voila.
Lynn Sr.::: We are not missing that appointment!
Lisa:::  Hmm.
Lisa::: Hmph.
Lynn Sr.:::  Ha-ha! We made it.  Heh-heh. I mean, Lisa, we'll wait for you in the lobby.
Rita::: You'll be just fine, sweetie.
Dr. Tran::: That's right, Lisa. This is a completely painless exam.
Lisa:::  So you say. But I know all about the dreaded puff of air. On an unrelated note, what languages do you speak?
Dr. Tran::: Uh, Thai, Spanish and English.
Lisa::: Ah. So no French, hmm? 
Todd:::  Understood.
Dr. Tran::: Okay, Lisa.  Lisa? 
Todd::: Where to now, Lisa?
Lisa::: I don't know but we can't stay here.  We've got four point three minutes before everyone will be looking for us.
Lisa::: Thus, we gotta skip town, go on the lam, get the heck outta Dodge.  Ugh!  Did you hear that? We must be near the train station. This way, Todd.
Todd::: But Lisa, I don't think--
Lisa::: Oh, Todd, please. I think I can identify a train whistle when I hear one. 
Todd::: You never take me seriously. 
Lisa::: Aha! This locomotive is our ticket outta here, Todd.  Now based on the wind and angle of the sun we're most definitely heading south-east.
Todd:::  I cannot see anything, so I will have to take your word for it.
Lisa::: Oh, Todd, how long was I out?  Being on the lam is tiring.
Todd::: Beats me. I was in sleep mode as well.
Lisa:::  Come on.  Oh.  Ahh, feel that refreshing ocean breeze.  And smell those oranges.  We must be in Florida.
Todd::: Now where did Miss Bossy pants go?
Janitor::: Huh?
Lisa:::  Todd, I hear the ocean. 
Flip::: Whoo whee! Flip hit the big time today. 
Lisa::: Okay, Todd, we need to locate food and shelter.  Ah! A local farmer trading his wares. 
Fake Chicken::: Try a nugget!
Lisa::: Hmm, so generous of you.  Delicious.
Fake Chicken::: Try a nugget!
Lisa::: Thank you, but I think one was enough. My robot companion and I need to find lodging. 
Fake Chicken::: Try a nugget!
Todd::: Lisa? Lisa?  Oooh, are those denim bucket hats?  Todd likey.
Lisa::: Todd, are you still giving me the silent treatment?  Take all the time you need.  A hotel at last!  I normally don't say this, Todd, but tonight's room service is on me.  Greetings, bellhop.  Oh, my bad. You must be the proprietor.  Tell me, good sir, can we get a double room for the evening?
Flip::: Ha! A nickel!  This is a great day.
Lisa::: Keep up, Todd.  Ooh! Perhaps they have a continental breakfast.  Hm. A little drafty.  And the mattress is rock hard. Just the way I like it.  Room service?  Mmm! Salmon sashimi. Thank you.  Todd, dinner is served.  Ah, my good man. I forgot your gratuity. Now don't spend it all in one place.  Soft padded paw, large predatory hook-like claws. This is an Ursus americanus.  Street name bear?! Ahh!  I've made a grave mistake!
Flip::: Eh, nope, just me, chief.
Lynn Sr.::: Lisa! There you are.
Lisa:::  I think I'm ready for my eye exam.
Lisa::: Thank you, Dr. Tran. And compliments on your doctoring skills. That was a painless exam. I'll definitely be returning for check-ups now that I've conquered my phobia. It only took a bear attack to set me straight.
Dr. Tran::: Huh?
Lisa:::  Oh, I need to locate my robot, Todd, and apologize. Hmm, wherever he is.
Announcer::: Now sporting the latest in summer fashion, Todd!
Todd::: I am really working it.
