Mr. Grouse::: Ow...
Lincoln::: Sorry, Mr. Grouse. Lisa's atomic jetpack needs adjust-
Mr. Grouse::: What the heck?
Luna::: Hey!
Announcer::: He's at the 40, the 30, he cuts! Go, all, the--
Leni::: Lily is hogging the TV at home, and I cannot miss The Dream Boat! Brent's mad at Braden for kissing Britney on the bridge.  Ooh, cheese puffs! Yummers! 
Lana::: Digging's more fun with a pal!
Lucy:::  Gravely more fun.
Mr. Grouse::: Why I outghta...
Lynn::: G-Man, wanna toss the pigskin around? Go long, Mr. Grouse!  Oh. My bad.  Can you throw the ball back?
Lana:::  'For Sale'?!
Leni::: Mr. Grouse, you're selling your front lawn?
Lynn Sr.::: I think it includes the house too, sweetie.
Luna::: But dude, you've lived next door to us, like, forever!
Mr. Grouse::: Well, that's the blasted point! I've put up with all your noise and nonsense for too dang long! I can't take one more second of it!  That's why I'm renting a place 'till my house sells. I need some peace and quiet, and I need it now!
Lily::: No, no move out.
Mr. Grouse:::  Sorry, Louds, my mind's made up.  Try your best to forget me. Adios, Louds!  Room for rent in quiet, cozy little condo. That sounds perfect.
Cheryl::: Well, what do ya say, sugar? You want to rent our spare bedroom?
Mr. Grouse::: Do you have any kids?  Then yes I do.
Mr. Grouse::: Eight o'clock. For once, getting to bed at a decent hour.
Mr. Grouse::: What is this malarky!?
Meryl::: We're in the boot-scootin' finals, so we gotta practise!
Mr. Grouse::: Well, can you at least turn the music down!?
Cheryl:::  What? You want to turn the boogie down?  Why, sure, roomie, get on in here!
Mr. Grouse::: Apartment for rent in relaxing senior community?
Mr. Grouse::: I should have moved here ages ago.
Scoots:::  Oh, stop shoveling in the chow! You know what time it is! PUDDING BALLOON FIGHT!
Mr. Grouse:::  Do you do this at every meal?
Scoots::: No. At dinner, we fill 'em with gravy.  Oh, we got us a runner!
Mr. Grouse::: Room for rent on serene boat.
Flip::: Hey chief, you're looking grumpier than usual today.
Mr. Grouse::: I can't find a peaceful place to rent in this stinkin' town! At this point, I'd pay anything.
Flip::: Eh, welcome to Rick's Rents & Rocks.  What can Rick do for ya?
Mr. Grouse:::  What is this, a TV prank show?
Flip:::  No, Sir. I'll tell you what, I can rent you my Mom's cabin in the woods. She's up at Mackinac Island learning to make fudge. Eh, did I mention all rentals come with a free rock? 
Mr. Grouse::: Eh, I don't know. 
Loud Sisters::: Hey, stop it! Don't push your sister!
Mr. Grouse::: I'll take it! 
Flip::: There's a ten dollar rock-handling fee.
Mr. Grouse::: Hello! Sweet mother of molasses! Peace and quiet at long last! 
Mr. Grouse::: Yessirree, Bud. This is the life.  Hey! Don't even think about it! 
Mr. Grouse::: Hey pal, how ya doing? I'm Bud Grouse. 
Mr. Bolhofner::: Weird name. I'm Bolhofner. 
Mr. Grouse::: You wanna come in and catch the game?
Mr. Bolhofner::: I hate sports. At wrestling school, my Dad was head coach. Never enough hustle for that man! 
Mr. Grouse:::  I, err, I got a real swell puzzle!
Mr. Bolhofner:::  Puzzles stress me out.
Mr. Grouse::: Or we could just talk.
Mr. Bolhofner:::  Talking stresses me out even more. Look, I need to get back to my cabin. I've got a lot of skinning I promised myself I'd finish.
Mr. Grouse::: Howdy neighbor!  I was in the area; I figured I'd stop by and see if you wanted any cheese puffs.  Woah! Get out of here! You ol' woodpecker! Gimme back that bowl!  Well, just eat around the beak marks. 
Mr. Bolhofner::: Yeah, I'm good, but thanks. 
Mr. Grouse::: Plenty of peace and quiet round here, huh? The place I used to live, nothing but non-stop commotion. I tell ya, boy, it was the pits.  Love all this quiet, don't you?
Mr. Grouse::: Hey there. You digging a hole, are ya?
Mr. Bolhofner::: Obviously.
Mr. Grouse::: That's what I told my rock friend here. 'I bet he's digging a hole'.  Eh, let me help.  You know what they say: digging is more fun with a pal. 
Mr. Bolhofner:::  No! That's the main water line!
Mr. Grouse::: Oh, hey neighbor. The door was open.
Mr. Bolhofner::: Pretty sure it wasn't.
Mr. Grouse::: Anyway, I thought we could watch TV. There's this program called The Dream Boat where youngsters embarrass themselves for love.
Mr. Bolhofner:::  Fine.
Mr. Grouse::: Try moving those around.
Mr. Bolhofner:::  Well, darn it. Looks like the TV's out. Tough toenails, I guess.
Mr. Grouse::: You give up too easy.
Mr. Bolhofner:::  I can't take anymore! I bought this cabin for some peace and quiet, and you're ruining it! You're a terrible neighbor! Go away!
Mr. Grouse::: He thinks I'm a terrible neighbor, huh? So I fell through his roof, it's not like I jetpacked through his wall. Hey Rocky, wanna see terrible neighbors?  Look at this one.  Can you imagine having to live next door to that?  I can't believe I'm saying this, but... I miss the Louds.  Sure, they're rowdy and nosy, but they're like family.  You're right! Why not go home? Boy, I sure got my money's worth on that rock-handling fee.
Mr. Grouse::: Aww!  You just couldn't leave me be, huh? 
Lynn:::  'Rick' told us where you were, after we agreed to buy a case of rocks.
Lynn Sr.:::  We, uh, we bought you a congratulations Lynn-sagna, to celebrate--  --you s-selling your house!
Mr. Grouse::: Wait, what now?
Lana::: People are at your house right now. Looks like they're gonna buy it.
Lucy::: Even I know that's not what a happy face looks like. What's wrong?
Mr. Grouse::: I was just about to move back home, but now I can't. All this time I thought I wanted peace and quiet, but once I had it, I realised how much I...  Mmm, mmmmm, missed-
Leni:::  We missed you too, Mr. Grouse.
Lincoln::: Wait a minute! Why can't you move back home? There might still be time to stop those buyers.
Mr. Grouse::: I'll drive! I can burn rubber.
Mr. Grouse::: Stop!  My house is no longer for sale! Turns out I'm staying put.
Wife::: Oh, sorry. Already bought it. We just signed the paperwork.
Husband::: This is the house for us. We love how peaceful the neighborhood is.
Mr. Grouse:::  Well, if you're gonna live here, you should meet your next door neighbors...  ...the Louds.
Louds:::  BYE!!! 
Mr. Grouse:::  Aww. It's good to be home.
