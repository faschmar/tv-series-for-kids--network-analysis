Trailer Narrator::: The following movie is rated A for awesome. Because Phoebe Powers is back. The first time, she drove them out of town...”
Bad Guy #1::: It's like taking candy from a baby.”
Phoebe::: Goo-goo ga-ga.”
Trailer Narrator::: The second time, was no day at the beach.”
Woman::: Hey! That guy stole my purse!”
Phoebe::: You just made a big misskate.”
Woman::: Yay!”
Trailer Narrator::: And this time… It's about to get ruff!”
Super Villain::: You have twenty-four hours to send me all the money in the world, or I'm launching the president's dog into space!”
Super Villain::: Come in?”
Pizza Delivery Guy::: Uh, did somebody order a large pepperoni with a side of…”
Phoebe::: Pain?”
Trailer Narrator::: Phoebe Powers in… Bark Night.”
Ronnie Anne::: Gah! This movie looks amazing!”
Sid::: And in three hours, we'll be sitting front row at the sneak preview.”
Rosa::: Mija, I need your help shopping for dinner tonight. Sergio usually helps carry the groceries, but he's throwing a birthday party for Sancho.”
Sergio:::  Party's gonna be pumpin', puddle water and dumpster fries. 
Ronnie Anne::: I'd love to help you shop, Abuela, but Sid and I are seeing this movie today, and Phoebe Powers is showing up afterwards to sign autographs.”
Rosa::: Ronalda, please, I really need your help. This shouldn't take long.”
Sid::: Don't worry, you can use the Bark Night app to make sure you're on time.”
Super Villain::: The movie starts in three hours, you don't want to miss it. For the dog's sake.” 
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, Abuela, I'm in.”
Rosa::: Great, here's the recipe list for tonight's dinner, we're just getting a few things. I'm making caldo de siete mares, soup of the seven seas.”
Ronnie Anne::: Seven? How about we make it soup of the two seas?”
Rosa:::  No.”
Rosa::: Great cooking starts with the best ingredients. First, we need limes.”
Ronnie Anne:::  This one looks good.”
Rosa:::  No no, the perfect lime has to be the right shade of green.”  Has to have the perfect smell.”  And finally, the right bounce.”
Rosa::: Yeah, no good. We're going to have to check each one.”
Ronnie Anne::: But there's like a hundred limes here.”
Rosa:::  Two hundred.”
Super Villain::: Two and a half hours until I launch this pooch into space.” 
Rosa::: Next up, my spice guy.”
Ronnie Anne::: Great, where is he?”
Rosa::: Four-hundred and seventy-fifth street.”
Ronnie Anne::: But we're on fifth. Noooooo!”
Ronnie Anne::: What are we looking at here?
Rosa::: Ssh! The calls for fresh epazote, so we have to wait for it to bloom, and pick it at just the right time.” 
Ronnie Anne:::  At this rate, there's no way I'm gonna make the movie.”
Rosa::: Hola, Sergio.”
Sergio:::  Got a problem.”
Rosa:::  AYE! What did you do?! Are those FIREWORKS?!”
Sergio:::  Long story. HURRY!” 
Rosa::: Mija! You'll have to finish without me. But you must follow my instructions precisely.” 
Ronnie Anne::: No problem, Abuela.”
Rosa:::  Gracias, Ronalda!”
Super Villain::: Almost time to pound this hound.”  Grab your popcorn now.”
Ronnie Anne::: I'll never get all of these ingredients in time. Unless I go to the Hi 'n' Buy, I mean ingredients are ingredients. Right?”  Good enough.”
Automatic Voice::: Welcome to the Hi 'n' Buy.”
Ronnie Anne:::  Hi.”  And bye!”
Sergio::: Come right in, the party is this way. Make way for the birthday boy!”
Ronnie Anne:::  Hey Sancho, feliz cumpleaños.”  Here you go, Abuela, all the ingredients exactly how you wanted them.”
Rosa::: Que rápida, muchacha. How'd you do it so fast?”
Ronnie Anne::: Uh, your instructions were just so good. Anyway, I gotta go to the theater.”
Rosa::: Of course! Go, go. Y muchas gracias, Mija. Tonight's dinner is so important.”
Ronnie Anne:::  Wait, what?”
Rosa::: A local food critic is coming here tonight to judge me for the city's best home cook.”
Ronnie Anne::: What?!”
Rosa::: I didn't want to say anything and get everyone's hopes up, but I'm pretty sure with these ingredients I may just win this thing.”
Ronnie Anne:::  Right.”
Rosa::: Aye! I have to start prepping! He'll be here at six.”  Thanks again, my little saviour.”
Sid::: You made it - trailers haven't even started yet. So you got all your shopping done?”
Ronnie Anne::: Yeah, I didn't do it exactly how Abuela asked. But, hey, ingredients are ingredients, right?”
Sid::: I guess. Ooh, trailers.”
Trailer Narrator::: In a world of lies...”  In a world of broken promises...”  In a world of aliens...”
Ronnie Anne::: Phew, thank goodness.”
Trailer Narrator::: One girl will break her grandmother's heart.”
Ronnie Anne::: GAH!!! Sid, I'm sorry, but I gotta go.” 
Sid::: What about the movie? And meeting Phoebe Powers?”
Ronnie Anne::: I'm sorry, but I was wrong - ingredients aren't ingredients.”
Sid::: Okay, but I'll miss you.”
Ronnie Anne::: Come on, pick up, Abuela. You can't use those bad ingredients.”
Ronnie Anne:::  GAAAAAAH!!! Okay, think. Abuela said her dinner is at six - I've still got time to get the right ingredients.”
Rosa's Voice::: For caldo siete mares, you need seven kinds of seafood, and for the best seafood, go to the fish market. Dottie sells the best catfish and talapia.”
Dottie::: I sell the best catfish and talapia! Catfish and talapia coming up!”
Rosa's Voice::: If you want to buy it, you gotta catch it. She used to be a ball player.”
Ronnie Anne::: I got it!”
Rosa's Voice::: If you want the best mussels, you have to beat Muscles in an arm-wrestling competition.”  P.S. - he gets easily distracted.”
Ronnie Anne::: Hey, hey, look! They're giving out free protein shakes.”
Rosa's Voice::: The perfect jumbo shrimp is shaped like a boomerang...”  ...and should act like one too.” 
Rosa's Voice::: Make sure you buy baby octopus, not older.”
Rosa's Voice::: If you want the clams to open up for you, you have to open up for the clams, tell them a secret.”
Ronnie Anne::: You better not tell anyone.
Rosa's Voice::: And finally, the squid. Don't forget your scuba gear.”
Ronnie Anne::: I did it! I got it all! And with plenty of time.”  Wait, why is there writing on the back?”
Rosa::: Actually, let's make it siete mares with a twist. Crab legs.”
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, it's fine, I've still got time.”
Loudspeaker::: You are out of time. The fish market is closed.”
Ronnie Anne::: Hi, Abuela.”
Rosa::: Mija, I'm sorry I missed your call, it's been crazy here.”
Sergio:::  It's the pigeon po-po! I was never here!” 
Rosa::: Is everything okay, Ronalda?”
Ronnie Anne::: No, I lied to you, I knew I wouldn't have enough time to get your ingredients and make my movie, so I went to the Hi 'n' Buy.”
Rosa::: Que, que!”
Ronnie Anne::: I know, I left the movie and tried to get the right stuff, but I couldn't get the crab legs.”  Abuela?”
Rosa::: Get in.”
Ronnie Anne::: There's the crab truck!”
Ronnie Anne::: Look out! BRIDGE!”
Ronnie Anne::: It's getting away!”
Rosa::: We'll see about that!”
Rosa::: Q'bole Crabby, let me get half a pound of your best stuff, por favor.”  Good thing we have a spare tire in the trunk.”
Ronnie Anne::: Oh no! Now we'll never get to our building in time.”
Rosa::: Don't worry Mija, I have some friends who owe me a favour.”
Food Critic::: Ooh.”
Rosa::: I hope you enjoy my caldo de siete mares, Mr. Famous Food Critic.”
Food Critic::: Wow! This is the best siete mares caldo, I've ever had, there's no contest, Mrs. Casagrande.”  You are officially the city's best home cook.”
Ronnie Anne::: I am so happy for you, Abuela!”
Rosa::: Thank you, Mija, I'm sorry you had to miss your action movie though.”
Ronnie Anne::: Are you kidding? A high speed chase to get crab legs, fighting a squid, and wrestling for muscles. I didn't miss the movie, I lived it, I'd help you shop for dinner anytime, Abuela.”
Rosa::: Gracias, but I still feel bad you didn't get to meet Phoebe Powers.”
Food Critic::: We'll see about that.”
Rosa and Ronnie Anne::: Phoebe Powers!?”
Rosa::: What are you doing here?”
Phoebe::: I was in town for the movie screening, and when I'm not acting I'm a secret food critic. Speaking of food, I have to know how you and your grandmother find such great ingredients.”
Ronnie Anne:::  We could show you. Abuela, could we go get stuff for tomorrow's breakfast? Please?”
Rosa:::  Let's do this.”
Phoebe::: Wow! Even I don't do my own stunts!”
