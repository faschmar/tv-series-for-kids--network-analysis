Luna:::   Hey, what's up with you guys?
Lincoln::: Dad's band just arrived for practice. You might wanna cover your ears.
Lynn Sr.::: Luna! Sweetie! Ah.  Glad you're here. Got a quick sec to help me and my new band?  Sooo, what do you think?
Kotaro::: Our first gig is tomorrow at Lynn's Table, and we really wanna nail it.
Harold::: We'd love your honest opinion.
Luna:::  Well um...
Lynn Sr.:::  She think's we're awful!
Luna::: No! I see a lot of potential.
Lynn Sr.::: You- you do?
Luna::: Sure! You're maybe just a skosh extra.  You know... a little loud.  A band should strive for balance.  Equal parts rock and roll.  Try this. Close your eyes.   Focus on the tune and listen to each other as you jam! 
Lynn::: Who knew they could do that?
Kotaro::: Awesome!
Lynn Sr.::: Sweetie, you took the Doo-Dads to a whole new level!
Luna::: Doo-Dads?
Rodney::: Our band name! My boy Rusty said it was 'sick'!
Luna::: Cool... Well, uh, glad I could help. You guys will rock that gig.<Br>
Lynn Sr.::: Luna, we want you to play with us tomorrow!
Luna::: Uh, say what?
Harold::: It'll be amazing! Kotaro, show her the nifty dance we're gonna do!
Rodney::: And I scored us matching threads from Duds for Dudes!
Luna::: Dudes, I'm honored, but I can't.  I've got a lot going on, and-
Lynn Sr.:::  But it's our first show, and we could really use your help to get us off the ground!  Just this one time?  Please?!
Mr. Coconuts::: Hey, what's the prob, doll?
Luna::: I agreed to play with Dad and his group tomorrow. If I'm seen with a dad band, no one will ever take me seriously as a rocker again!
Luan::: Well, why don't you just tell him no?
Luna:::  This is why! 
Luan::: Yeesh. He gave you the old sad dad peepers, huh?  But, come on, is a band really that embarrassing?
Rodney, Kotaro, and Harold::: Go, go, go, go, go!
Mr. Coconuts::: Yikes. This reminds me of when I did that comedy review with Baron Bananas. Every joke was about bananas! Being on the same stage as that hack almost ruined my reputation!
Luna::: So what'd you do?
Mr. Coconuts::: I kept my pals away from the club.
Luna:::  Yeah, that's a great idea! Wow, thanks, Mr. C. You're a real lifesaver.
Luna::: Dudes, careful! Someone's gonna see me!  Gah! Sam and Mazzy! 
Sam::: Hey, Louds. Whoa! Nice amp! Is it tube or solid state?
Lincoln:::  Um, not sure, but boy, is it hot out here.  Don't want this baby to sit in the sun! Bye! 
Luna::: Thanks for helping me out, dudes. You remember the plan?
Leni::: Keep your friends away and make sure no one in the audience films the show so it doesn't leak.
Luna::: Wow, Leni, you nailed it! OK, everybody, let's roll out. 
Leni::: If it does leak, should we call a plumber?
Lola:::  And there it is.
Luna::: You can do this. 
Dads::: Ooooooooooooh! Ooooooooooooh!
Kotaro::: Band ritual. Come on, Luna, join us.
Dads::: Ooooooooooooh! Ooooooooooooh!
Announcer::: Get ready for an epic rock odyssey across space, time, and this family restaurant. Here they are, the Doo Dads!
Scoots::: Move! You're blocking my view!<Br>
Cheryl::: Great show, y'all! That was more fun than spitting down a well!
Lynn Sr.::: Ooh, another fan! We are a ding dang hit!
Rodney::: Yes! Can't deny we were pretty fly!
Harold::: And we owe it all to you, Luna!
Luna::: Aw, dudes, I'm just glad it all worked out for you guys.  We did it! No friends in, no videos out! I'm officially off the hook! I owe you guys big time!
Lynn Sr.:::  Argh! Luna, come quick!
Dads and Mayor Davis::: Ooooooooooooh! Ooooooooooooh!
Luna::: Mayor Davis?! What's going on?
Mayor Davis::: I came to tell them I loved their show and asked if they'd play the Royal Woods Festival in the park. Then they started doing whatever...this is, and well, I got swept up.  So, can I take this as a yes?
Lynn Sr.::: A big ol' ding-dang yes!
Mayor Davis::: Great! See you all this weekend! 
Luna::: Dudes, congrats! The festival is a major gig! I can't wait to cheer you on.
Kotaro::: Cheer us on? Luna, we couldn't have made it this far without you. You have to play with us.
Luna::: No! I-I mean, uh, this is a chance for the Doo Dads to shine!
Harold::: As far as this Doo Dad's concerned, you, my dear, are officially one of us.<Br>
Luna::: It's just that I--
Lynn Sr.::: Sweetie, I know you're really busy and I know I said only one show, but performing on stage at a city festival and getting to share it with you... This is more than I could have dreamed of.
Mr. Coconuts::: What's nagging you now, toots?
Luna::: I gotta play with Dad's band again at the festival in the park! Everyone in town will see me.
Mr. Coconuts::: Oh, relax. Here's how you get out of it: Fake an injury, just like I did when I was supposed to perform with Bananas for the Queen of Sweden. I said I had knobby knees.
Luna:::  That is so good! Thanks, dude! 
Lynn Sr.::: Hey there, Luna. Wanna come jam with-  AAH!
Luna::: No. Bad news, guys. I got a serious case of shred hands. Takes weeks to heal. Guess I'll have to bow out of the gig.
Lynn Sr.:::  What are we gonna do?
Lynn:::  Go long, Stinkin'!
Lynn Sr.:::  If you can catch a football like that, your hands will definitely be healed in time to play at the festival. Guess it wasn't as bad as you thought, huh?
Luna:::  Yeah. I-I guess not.  Woo-hoo.
Luna:::  Man. My rock career is over.
Mr. Coconuts::: Ah, don't get your boots in a bunch. This place is Lamesville. Nobody from your school will be here.
Mayor Davis:::  Attention, festival-goers. Don't forget that it's high school day. The first fifty students get free Flippees!
Mr. Coconuts::: OK, fine. But I'm sure you won't know anybody else here.
Cheryl::: Meow, y'all!
Luan::: Wow, Cheryl, I barely recognize you.
Luna::: Where's the face-painting booth?!
Lynn Sr.::: I, I don't know. I'm not so sure about this, sweetie, no one will know who we are!
Luna::: Exactly! I mean, all the cool bands have rocking stage personas! 
Scoots::: Sorry, but that's what you get for walking in the splash zone! Hahaha! 
Luna::: Ugh! Gotta find something else!  Guys, let's wear these on stage!  Or, um...  Hey, a fog machine! Everybo-- Yah!
Lynn Sr.::: Sweetie, I think I know what's going on. Shred hands, face painting, fog... you don't want to be seen on stage with our band.
Luna::: Wha-? No way! I love playing with you dudes!  Oh. OK. Oh, I'm afraid no one will think I'm a legit rocker if they see me with your band. I'm sorry.
Lynn Sr.::: Don't be. I understand. We have our own different styles of music and that's OK. You don't have to play with us. I mean that.
Luna::: Thanks, Pops. You rock.
Dads::: Ooooooooooooh!
Luna::: Don't worry about the crowd. They'll love you!
Lynn Sr.:::  Who's worried?  Not this guy!
Mayor Davis:::  Hey there, fest-heads!  We've got a real treat for you. Put your hands together for the Doo Dads!
Kotaro::: Uh, Lynn, buddy, you OK?  Hey, everybody. I'm really sorry, but it looks like we'll have to just-
Luna::: Just follow my lead.  There you go! Now move those hips!
Sam::: All right! Rock on!
Cheryl::: Kitty like, meow!
