Spooky TV Announcer::: You're watching Fright TV, up next, the season premiere of Vampires of Melancholia.
Lucy::: This is it, Edwin. A whole new season of our favorite show, can't wait to watch it, just you and me.
Lori::: Hey, Luce.
Leni::: Scoot over.
Lucy:::  What are you doing here? The Dream Boat is on Monday nights, remember?
Lori and Leni::: Duh, we're here to watch VoM!
Lucy::: First, please don't call it that, second, you guys have never been interested in my show, why are you--?
Lori and Leni::: Ah! There he is!
Blake/Tristan::: Woah, this place looks sick.
Lori and Leni:::  Blake Bradley!
Lucy::: Who?
Lori:::  Duh, literally the cutest actor ever.
Leni:::  Didn't you know he was gonna be a new character on VoM?
Lucy:::  Sigh, it's called--
Blake/Tristan::: Yo! Anybody home?
Lori:::  Why is he literally so dreamy?
Leni::: Yikes, who's that creepy guy?
Lucy::: That's Edwin, the main character.
Blake/Tristan::: H-Hey, Uncle Eddie.
Edwin::: Tristan, my great-great-great-great grand nephew, this is a surprise.
Blake/Tristan::: Looking good, are you sure you're really three hundred?
Edwin::: What brings you to Melancholia?
Blake/Tristan::: Just thought I'd crash at casa creepy for a while.
Edwin::: Well, I must confess, I'm not really custom to sharing my castle with mortals.
Blake/Tristan::: No worries bro, I can hang with anyone, now bring it in. Bro hug.
Lori:::  So gorge.
Leni::: You can just tell, he'd be a great boyfriend.
Lucy:::  What is happening?
Edwin::: Sigh.
Lori::: Wait, who's she?
Lucy::: Griselda, the other main character, she's on a quest to the underworld right now, if you guys had watched the show from the beginning you'd--
Leni:::  Why are her teeth all pointy? Wait, his teeth are pointy too.
Lucy:::  Because they're vampires.
Spooky TV Announcer::: Tune in next week, for more Vampires of Melancholia.
Lori:::  That was literally amazing.
Leni::: Totes, this is definitely gonna be our new Friday night thing, Lori, me, you and VoM.
Lucy::: It's Vampires of Melancholia!  I have to put a stop to this.
Lori::: How excited are you for tonight's episode?
Leni::: So excited! According to rumors on social media, Tristan's going to turn the dungeon into a gym. Tristan working out, can you even?
Lucy:::  Let's hope this works Edwin.  Hey guys, now that we're all, um, ' VoM heads ', you have to join me in all of the super fun pre-show rituals.
Lori::: Rituals?
Lucy::: Yeah, the stuff we fans do to get in to vampire mode.  You guys are going to love them.  First, you have to look the part, with a full vampire makeover.
Leni:::  Eww, do we have to look so sickly?
Lucy::: Well, it's a really important part of watching the show, but if you're not in to it and you'd rather just go back to watching The Dream Boat.
Lori::: Don't be ridiculous. Come on, Leni. It'll be good contouring practice.  Look how much their cheek bones pop.
Leni:::  Good point!
Lori::: Wait.  Halloween leftovers!
Leni:::  Look, I'm Tristan's weird old uncle.
Lucy::: Next, you have to see the world from a vampire's perspective.
Lori::: Uh, this is giving me a migraine.
Leni::: Yeah, and I'm getting a headache.  Wait, is that my missing jelly sandal under the couch?  Wahoo!
Lori:::  And my missing ring!
Leni:::  And Lucy, I found your creepy dolls!
Lucy:::  Give me those!
Leni::: We should def do this every week. We'll never lose anything again.
Lucy:::  Sigh.
Lucy::: Next, you have to watch the show as a vampire would, in one of these. 
Lori:::  Uh, this provides zero lumbar support.
Leni:::  It's also really hard on your back.
Lori::: I cannot spend a whole hour in this.
Leni::: Wait, I know!  Decorative throw pillows! They'll add support,  and a little zhuzh.
Lori::: Ooh! And we can use the lid to make a fun TV tray.
Lucy::: Wait, there's still one more ritual.  This is an absolute must. Toasting every new episode with a refreshing glass of homemade blood.
Leni:::  Eww!  I don't know if I can handle this.
Lucy::: I get that. It's not easy being a fan of this show. I'll understand if you guys wanna bail.
Lori::: Wait,  Beet smoothies! They look just like blood, but now they're delicious and full of antioxidants. Yay!
Leni::: Cheers!
Lucy::: Sigh.
Lori::: Ooh, ooh! It's starting.
Edwin::: My darling Griselda, how I wish you were here to help me endure this visit from my boorish nephew. He actually asked me if I was a boxers or briefs man.
Tristan:::  Oh yeah! Yo, Uncle Eddie. Wanna play some corn hole?
Edwin:::  What happened to my castle?!
Tristan::: I redecorated it, bro!  Put some boom in your gloom! And look, I got you a lid so we can match in the thatch! Now, how about a selfie with your favorite nephew.
Edwin:::  I told you. I don't show up in these.
Tristan::: Oh right, my bad.
Lori:::  Good times, Luce. Can't wait for next week!
Lucy:::  As long as that fool Tristan is on the show, Lori and Leni are gonna keep ruining it for me.  Hmm... But what if he weren't on the show?
Lucy::: This emergency meeting of The Young Morticians Club is now called to order. I have a favor to ask. You guys watch Vampires of Melancholia right?
Haiku::: Eh, Not since Tristan's been on it.
Persephone::: He's totally ruining it.
Bertrand::: The bro must go.
Boris::: The worst.
Morpheus::: He's awful.
Dante::: He's gross.
Lucy::: How would you like to help me get rid of him?
Lucy::: Hi. I'm collecting signatures to remove Blake Bradley from Vampires of Melancholia. Would you sign?
Lucy and Haiku::: Goth perks.
Lucy::: Okay. Did everyone finish their protest letters to the studio?
Haiku::: Mine's a poem. Should we take these to the post office?
Lucy::: No. That'll take too long. I have a better idea.  You know what to do, Fangs,  and no biting.
Lucy::: This is it, Edwin. Time to see if our protests were heard.
Lori and Leni:::  Who's ready for some VoM?!
Lori::: Check out the shirts we made, 'TEAM TRISTAN'!
Leni::: Don't worry, we made Team Edwin shirts for you guys.
Lucy::: Oh, uh, thanks.
Tristan::: Great grub, Uncle Eddie, but you got any garlic for these fries?
Edwin::: Garlic?!  Are you serious?
Tristan::: Guess that's a neg. Hey, how 'bout we burn off these carbs with a post-meal workout?
Edwin:::  What?!  Or instead of a workout, eh, how about we walk along the misty, slippery, cliffs of Melancholia?
Leni::: Mmm, cardio.  This should be fun.
Lucy::: Yes, it should. 
Tristan::: Dude, this mist is like a built-in airbrush filter.
Edwin:::  Careful, Tristan. The cliffs.
Tristan:::  It's cool, Uncle Eddie. Just gotta take this self-  iiiiieeeeeeee......!
Lori and Leni:::  What?! Tristan! No!
Lucy:::  Oh no. Not Tristan, the horror.
Leni:::  He was so young, and so cute!
Lori::: How could VoM do this?! Uh... Sorry Lucy. I literally can't even deal right now!
Spooky TV Announcer::: And now, an all new episode of Vampires of Melancholia.
Lucy:::  Blissful solitude at last.
Edwin::: Why does something feel amiss? No more selfies, or protein shakes, or dreaded bro hugs, and yet, sigh. I feel a twinge of remorse.  Yes, Tristan could be a bit of a fool, and his home gym did ruin my marble floors. But he meant well. After all, he just wanted to spend time with, family,  and I drove him to his demise.
Lucy::: Gasp.  And I am a cold, selfish, sister.
Edwin:::  Tristan! I'm sorry! Forgive me, Tristaaaan!
Lucy::: Oh, Edwin. I know it's too late to get Tristan back, but maybe it's not too late for my sisters.  Lori? Leni?  I guess it is too late. I blew it.  Sigh. 
Lori:::  So, Lisa wanted my used tissues and-
Lucy::: Gasp. Lori, Leni, will you please watch Vampires of Melancholia with me? I know you probably don't want to now that Tristan's gone. The truth is, I just wanna hang out with you guys.
Lori::: Of course we'll watch. Tristan may have been the reason we got into the show, but the reason we stayed is because its been so much fun, sharing it with you.
Leni::: Yeah. In fact, we were just at the store getting vampire themed snacks for tonight.  I got garlic bread, is that right?
Lucy::: Well, actually...  Never mind, it's perfect. Come on.
Edwin::: Who could that be?  A wandering traveler? A door to door salesman?
Tristan::: What's up, Uncle Eddie?
Edwin::: Tristan? You're back! But how?  Griselda?! You're back too?!
Griselda::: We crossed paths in the underworld. Bringing him back with me was a snap. Well, more of a bite.
Lori:::  Yay! Tristan!
Leni:::  Yes! Ah!
Lucy:::  Huh, guess my protest didn't affect the show after all. I'm glad.
Leni::: Am I crazy? Or is Tristan even cuter as a vampire?
Lucy::: Well, the fangs do help.
