Lana::: I don't have any fives, Willy. Go fish.  No! That means take another card! 
Sam::: I just picked up these three, and I've got two cats in the van! Do we have any room, Lana?
Lana:::  I think we can make it work.  Three pups for pick up-  Ah, oof.  Larry, my man!  Can you show our new guests to your room?  They'll be bunking with you tonight.  Now, dinner's at six. We're having salmon kibble tonight, so get there early. And the spa closes at eight.
Sam::: Uh, Lana. I've been meaning to talk to you about something.
Lana::: Look, I'll replace the dog food. Sometimes I just get hungry.
Sam::: Wait, what? No, that's... not it. The overcrowding in here is a problem. And I was thinking maybe we could free up some space if... we found a new home for the exotic animals.
Lana::: You mean Willy, Squirt, and Larry? We can't!
Sam::: No, no, no!  I found this awesome place for them called 'The Exotic Pet Playground'. It's in Ohio.
Lana:::  Ohio?! Aw. That's like a gazillion miles away. 
Sam::: They need to be in an environment where they can thrive, Lana. The shelter is no place for them.
Lana::: Sam, they're my best friends! If you send them away we'll never see each other.
Sam::: Well, I'm open to other ideas.
Lana::: I'll take 'em to my house!
Sam::: Are your parents gonna be cool with that?
Lana:::  Of course they are.
Rita:::  We can help in other ways.  But there is no room-- for more pets.  We already have Charles, Cliff, and Geo...
Lynn Sr.::: Fangs and El Diablo...
Rita::: Hops and Walt...
Lynn Sr.::: And don't forget that fox over there...  Wait... we don't have a fox!
Lana::: What am I gonna do now?  Great idea, Hops man! If I can get other people in town to take in my buds, I'll still see them all the time! 
Lana::: Hey, Mr. Grouse. I was wondering...
Mr. Grouse::: Neh... What'd you break? Was it a window? My new aluminum sliding?
Lana::: Oh, I didn't break anything. I came by to see if you needed some company.
Mr. Grouse:::  Hard pass. Company means entertaining, entertaining means chit chat and you know that I hate?
Mr. Grouse & Lana::: Chit chat!
Lana::: Well, then I have the perfect company for you.  He doesn't talk. Loves hockey. And you guys both hate when I do this. 
Mr. Grouse::: Meh!
Lana::: See? You're a match made in heaven!
Mr. Grouse::: I don't know. He looks like a handful.
Lana::: He won't be. I'll come by every day to feed him, clean him, and deal with any of his needs. Pleeeease? He just needs a place to live.
Mr. Grouse::: Meh, eh... Fine.  But he better not sit in my cozy chair.
Liam::: Yee-haw! 
Lana::: So... what do you think?
Liam::: I do love me a llama.  And ol' Larry here is more fun than a colt who got himself into a pot of Mee-Maw's morning joe.
Lana::: I'm sensing a 'but' coming...  Not your butt, Larry.
Liam::: Gee, uh, Mee-maw and I are spread a lil' thin on the farm already.
Lana::: Say no more, Liam. I'd be happy to come by and deal with any and all Larry situations.
Liam::: Well, if that's the case, you got yourself a deal!
Howard::: Lana, we would love to help your animals. But a flying squirrel?
Harold::: Yeah, we're more cat people.
Lana::: Hmmm... you don't say. She's nocturnal so she'll sleep most of the day. Gimme a spare house key and I'll take care of everything.  Yes!
Lynn Sr.::: Kids, dinner!
Lynn Sr.::: Um... why is Grouse heavily painting our window?
Mr. Grouse::: Look at this mess!  Your dang bird's running up my water bill!
Lana::: That's 'cause penguins love being wet, Mr. Grouse. And apparently, bubble baths. I'll take care of this. You got any fish in your fridge?  One fish treat for you...
Mr. Grouse::: Uh, excuse me...
Lana::: And a fishy treat for you...  All right. My work here is done. Time for me to go get my grub on. 
Liam::: Lana, come quick! Virginia and Larry are a'tusslin'!
Lana::: Larry! Drop it!
Lola::: Hm? It's three in the morning! Why are you awake at this unseemly hour? 
Lana::: Spending time with my buds was so much easier when everyone was in one place.  I can't bring them home, Hops. Mom and Dad already said no.  Hm. Maybe you're right. Maybe they don't have to know. 
Lynn Sr.::: Huh? Huh?
Lana:::  Um, this is all a dream.
Lana::: You can watch 'The Dream Boat', but don't stay up too late. We got a big day of hanging out tomorrow. I'm so happy you guys are here. 
Lynn Sr.:::  Hey, I gotta stop eating those spicy nuts before bed, Rita. Last night I dreamt that there was a ding dang penguin climbing our stairs!  Oh, forgot my shower cap!
Rita:::  Hello there, beautiful!  What the heck? 
Lynn Sr.::: It-it wasn't me, honey! 
Lana::: If I were a flying squirrel, where would I be?  So cute... yet so mischievous. 
Lynn Sr.::: Lana! 
Rita::: Are you okay? What are you doing in here?
Lana::: Oh! I was looking for, uh... toilet paper. Yep. Lucy wants me to wrap her up like a mummy.
Rita::: Wait. Toilet paper? In our bedroom? On the top of the armoire?
Lana::: You know I should go look for that TP. This was fun.  On the other hand, let's talk about this armoire. Why's it called that anyway? It doesn't even have arms! 
Lynn Sr.::: Is... is our fan on? I-I feel a breeze.
Lana::: This is not toilet paper. 
Lana::: That was a close one. We gotta be more careful if this is gonna work. What were you thinking sneaking out of the attic?!  Oh, I get it. You don't want to be stuck in an attic all day. I just thought, if you guys were here, we'd be able to hang all the time! You should be eating healthy food. Exercising. Flying free! This isn't fair to any of you.  I don't want to lose you, either. But...  What's that, Lar.  Hey, look! It's the pamphlet from Sam!  Whoa! Sam was right! This place actually looks amazing!
Lana:::  So, I guess this is good-bye, huh?  This is for you. In case you get sleepy on the trip.  Stay cool in the van, Willy.  Don't tell Lola about this, but I got you something to munch on during the trip. Bring it in, guys. 
Sam::: You're doing the right thing, Lana.
Lana::: I know, but it still hurts.
Sam::: Which is why I talked to the Exotic Animal Playground and found a way for you guys to talk whenever you want. 
Lana::: Show me your new digs, Will!  And everyone in the Tree Top Kingdom lived happily ever after.  What's on the dinner menu tonight, Lar? We're having Lynn-til soup!
Lola::: Is-- that my Miss Kiddy Kalamazoo sash?! 
Lana::: Bye, Larry!
