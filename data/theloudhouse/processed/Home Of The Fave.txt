Lynn Sr.:::  Hey, kids, anyone up for a trip to the market with ol' Dad-o?
Luan::: I'll go! I'm out of banana peels. Lincoln's about to use my last one.
Lincoln::: What? No, I'm nooooooot. 
Luan:::  I'm also gonna need a dozen eggs.
Lola:::  I'll go too! Lily ate all the macaroni off my necklace.
Luan::: Hey, Dad, wanna hear some knock-knock jokes?
Lynn Sr.::: Does Cliff poop in my shoes? Heck yes, I do!
Lola:::  Well, here we go...
Luan::: Okay, here's another one. Knock, knock.
Lynn Sr.::: Who's there?
Luan::: Europe.
Lynn Sr.::: Europe who?
Luan:::  No, you're a poo.
Lynn Sr.:::  Stop, stop, I can't drive!
Luan:::  Hey Dad, I think we need a different cart, this ones got a leek. 
Lynn Sr.:::  Are zucchini me?  Did you get it, Lola? Like, Are you kidding me? but I said, Zucchini me? 
Lola:::  I get it. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the pasta aisle. 
Lynn Sr.:::  Attention shoppers! Please excuse this Lynn-terruption!
Luan::: And, settle in for some Luan-tics!
Lynn Sr. and Luan:::  Went to the store for a loaf of bread! Bought a can of beans instead! 
Lola:::  Just be glad you missed this song at the meat counter.
Annoyed Customer:::  I didn't.
Luan::: Hey Dad, what did the left eye say to the right eye? Between you and me, something smells.
Lynn Sr.:::  Because of the nose.  You okay back there, sweetie? You seem a little quiet.
Lola:::  I'm fine.
Lynn Sr.::: Do you need help getting out of your seatbelt, Lola?
Lola::: I can get it myself.  Actually, I, I-I need help.
Lynn Sr.:::  Hey, sweetie, here's your macaroni, we've also got some whole wheat penne if you wanna make dangle earrings.
Lola::: Brown earrings? Hard pass. 
Rita:::  Uh oh, someone's upset. Did Lana eat her mud mask again?
Lynn Sr.::: No, she's mad at me, I...I think I messed up.
Rita::: What makes you say that?
Lynn Sr.::: Well, I took Luan and Lola to the store earlier and you know how Luan and I come up with some of our best material there.
Rita:::  Mm-hmm.
Lynn Sr.::: Well, I think we got carried away and Lola might've felt left out. I don't want her to think I'm favoring Luan over her.
Rita::: Oh, honey, I'm sure she doesn't think that.
Lynn Sr.::: No, no, my dad used to play favorites all the time and it drove me nuts.
Young Lynn Sr.::: Hey Dad, you ready to make some Key Lynn Pie with me?  Oh, they must've had other plans. I guess I can make it by myself.  Ding dang darn it!
Lynn Sr.::: I can't believe I did the same thing to Lola. I have to fix this!
Rita:::  Well, I'm sure you can make it up to her, just, please don't get her another pony. That did not work out. 
Lynn Sr.::: Hey sweetie, ar-are you busy?  Well, I just happened to come across these matching princess dresses at the mall,  and I thought...
Lola:::  That's my color!
Lynn Sr.::: Of course, powder pink. But wait, there's more.
Lola:::  Stick on earrings!  Yay! Daddy!
Lola::: Did you hear, the Goosemans got into it with the postal worker?
Lynn Sr.::: No, way, tell me more.
Lola::: Okay, so, apparently one of their packages showed up wet, and they just lost it.  Be careful, the floor is lava.
Lynn Sr.:::  Ah! I'm burning!  You saved me!
Lola:::  I forgot, There's snakes on the couch!
Lola::: Now blot.
Lynn Sr.:::  Wow. This is my color.
Lola::: Told you so. Ruby red.
Lynn Sr.:::  Wow! A nine?
Lola:::  Oh, oopsie, sorry.  That was a six.
Lynn Sr.::: You up for another episode of 'Prison Pageant Wars'?
Lola::: Obviously, we have to find out what talent Lil' Juice goes with. 
Lynn Sr.:::  I had fun too, sweetie. Okay, have a good nap.  Problem solved. 
Lynn::: Hey, Dad, I thought we were gonna work out together.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, oh no, I'm sorry, LJ. I must've spaced it. I, I-I don't know how that happened.  B-But I'm free now, let me just change out of this.
Lynn::: Eh, never mind. I'm just gonna hit the showers. 
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, o-okay.
Lynn Sr.'s Thoughts::: Ding dang darn it! Now Lynn's feelings are hurt. Don't panic, you can fix this.
Lynn Sr.::: LJ, wait!  That's what I get for running in heels...
Lynn::: Walk it off, Dad.
Lynn Sr.::: Uh, slow down honey, I'm trying to keep up here.  Fifty-seven! Tapioca! Charles! Hut! Hut! Hike!
Lynn:::  Whoo! Yeah! Alright! Alright! Alright!
Lynn Sr.:::  We did it! We did it! Woo-hoo!  Huh?  Ohhhhhhh.  In prophase, the nuclear envelope breaks down as spindle fibers emerge from the c-, cen-, c-, cen-, cen-...
Lisa::: Sound it out.
Lynn Sr.::: Centrosomes?  Oooowwww.  It's funny how that hurt.  ...and this was your great-great-great grandfather, Lynwood Loud. He was the first Loud with flat feet.
Lynn Sr.::: Bah bah bow, way to go, Daddy-O, now my kids know I don't play favorites.
Luan:::  Ooh, you made my favorite!
Lynn Sr.:::  What?
Luan::: Oh, beef stroganoff! My fave.
Lynn Sr.::: It i-it is?
Luan::: Yeah, Dad. You know I can't get anoff of it. 
Lynn Sr.:::  LOL, sweetie, haha, that's-  Ding dang darn it to heck! If I make Luan's favorite dinner, the kids will think she's my favorite and we'll be back to square one!  Ooohh...  Easy fix.  Kids! Dinner's ready!  Dig in, fam.
Lori:::  Wow, Dad, did you make eleven different dishes?
Lynn Sr.::: Yep, no big deal. Just wanted to do...  ...something special, so I made all your faves.
Lana::: Even my worms au gratin?
Lynn Sr.:::  Au course. Haha.
Lana::: Au right!
Lisa::: Uh, would you mind consuming that in an alternate location? Say the garage.
Lynn Sr.'s Thoughts::: Wait, if I sit by Lisa, it'll look like she's my favorite.
Lynn Sr.:::  Uh, kids, I'm just gonna sit in the corner tonight. That way I can see and hear you all equally.
Lily::: Ouchie! 
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, oh, oh no, did you bite your finger, sweetie? Hang on, daddy will fix your boo-boo, here we go.  But, you're not the only one daddy cares about, Lily. Boo-boo kisses for everyone, heh, heh.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  One more--
Lana::: I might not want to do that, Dad. I've been on quite a picking spree.
Lynn Sr.::: Well, I'll keep your kiss in my pocket.
Lucy::: Are you feeling okay, Dad?
Lynn Sr.::: Oh yeah, I'm fine, never better! How was your afternoon, sweetie?
Lucy::: Sigh. Fine. Dug a grave, contemplated getting in it.
Lynn Sr.:::  Hold that thought! I mean, how was everyone's afternoon? Not just Lucy's but you know, also Lucy's.
Leni::: So, who should go first?
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, I-I know, uh, we'll pick numbers from a hat.
Leni::: Who do you want to pick first?
Lynn Sr.::: Uhh, well, ya, uh,  we'll pick numbers from another hat to decide that. 
Leni::: Oh, okay. So, who should pick first from the second hat?
Lincoln::: Hey, Dad. Everything okay?
Lynn Sr.:::  I'm sorry kids, but no matter what I do, I'll never be able to keep things fair. I try not to play favorites, but, obviously I failed.
Lincoln::: What are you talking about, Dad? We know you don't play favorites. 
Lynn Sr.::: But, but, Lola, weren't you mad at me for giving Luan so much attention at the store?
Lola::: That's not why I was mad. I mean, yeah, shopping with you two is always annoying, but my beef was with the checkout lady. She wouldn't give me a free balloon. She said I didn't deserve it.  She doesn't know my life!
Lynn::: I wasn't upset about that.  I just found out my favorite QB broke his collarbone. He's out for the whole season!
Lynn Sr.::: Wait, so, none of you kids thought I was playing favorites?
Lisa::: Negatory. We all feel equally assured of your affections.
Lori::: Yeah Dad, it's actually kind of embarrassing how much you love us.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh... Kids, thank you. I'm just so glad none of you feels left out.
Lola:::  Aww, come on Daddy, bring it in.
Lynn Sr.:::  So, it turns out that the kids were fine. I guess I really don't play favorites the way my dad did.
Rita::: See, I knew you had nothing to worry about. You're a wonderful father.
Lynn Sr.::: Aw, thanks, Rita.  Oh, Cliff, who's Daddy's big boy? Who's Daddy's big-
