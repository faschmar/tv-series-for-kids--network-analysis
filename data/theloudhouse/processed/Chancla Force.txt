Rosa::: Dinnertime.
Hector::: Where is everybody?
Rosa::: I told you, hijo,  Frida and Carlos went to that big art and music festival Burning Flan, and Ronnie Anne and Bobby are at Arturo's for the weekend.
Hector::: Oh, dibs on their dinner.
Rosa::: Carl, CJ, don't forget your espárragos.
Carl::: Oh, yucko!
Rosa:::  Carl, you need your vegetables.
Carl:::  Okay, abuela, I'll eat them.  Release the chocolate sauce and sprinkles!
Rosa:::  Release the chancla.
Carl:::  Gimme some!
Carl::: Fort Macho Muchacho is finally complete.
CJ::: No one can knock it down.
Sergio:::  Think again!
Carl & CJ::: Invaders!
Rosa::: It's time for bed.
Carl:::  But, Abuela, we're having so much fun.
Rosa:::  I'm not going to tell you again. A la cama. Go to bed. 
Carl::: How does Abuela always know just when to break up our fun? She's like a bruja or something.
Rosa:::  Who are you calling a witch?
Carl::: We can't eat what we want, we can't play when we want.
CJ::: We can't do anything.
Carl::: We have to fight back! Stage a protest! Stop doing our chores!
Sergio:::  Not unless you want that chancla.
Carl:::  Sergio, you're right! It's those chanclas. They're the source of her power. If we can get rid of them, Abuela won't he able to control us anymore.
CJ::: He's right, it's never been done before.
Carl::: We have to try!
Rosa:::  Lights out!
Carl::: The path of the chancla is predictable. It follows a regular route every day.
Narrating Carl::: After breakfast, abuela makes the rounds through the building, fixing junk. 
Rosa::: There, that should fix the leak.
Narrating Carl::: Next, she does chores around the house.  And if all else fails, there's always nighttime.
Carl::: Super-stealth ninja has landed. I'm going in.  Ugh! Wrong feet.  Oh, I knew it. She wears them in her sleep.  Ha-ha! Yes!
Carl::: The chanclas are mine!
Sergio:::  Now hide ‘em. Before she knows they're gone.
Carl::: I'll put them in one of my top-secret hiding spots. No peeking!
Carl::: Good morning, abuela.  Hit me, Sergio!
Rosa::: What are you doing, señorito?
Carl::: Just dressing up my eggs.
Rosa::: Oh, yes, I couldn't find my chanclas this morning. Oh, well. Never mind, mijo. Eat your whipped cream huevos.  That's almost two food groups.
Maria:::  Mom,  is there anything good to eat?  I'm starved.  Did you hear the news? The chancla's gone. We can do whatever we want!
Carl:::  Whoa, adults are scared of the chancla, too?
Maria::: Since we were kids, the chancla has controlled our lives. And now we're free!
Carl:::  All right, Tía! Adiós, chancla!
Maria:::  Frida, Carlos, hurry back home. The chancla is gone!  I know, right? We're going to have a blast!
Carl::: I've never had so much fun in my life! I need to share this with El Falcon.  Now, where did I leave him?  Gross!  Where are you, El Falcon?  Has anyone seen my...  Is that my monkey grip hair gel?  And my Halloween candy?!
CJ:::  Time to fly! 
Carl::: And El Falcon?! You know he's off-limits!
CJ::: No chancla, no rules!  Whoa!
Carl::: Falcon!  Abuela! CJ, Carlitos, Abuelo and Lalo took my stuff and broke my El Falcon toy!
Rosa:::  Why don't you go break one of their toys?
Carl::: Mom! Dad! Thank goodness you're home.  Your children are out of control!
Frida::: Ay, Carl, not now. I'm listening to my jams.
Carlos:::   And I'm gonna skateboard in the halls. Without pants!  Whoo-hoo! Oh ho! I'm free!
Frida::: Oh! Go, baby! Go!
Carl::: I'm so hungry.  Is anyone gonna cook dinner?
Hector::: Give me that popcorn-wiener-cookie!
Sergio::: It's mine!
Carl:::  I guess I'll just go to bed.  Hey, what are you all doing in my room? Get off my bed!
Maria::: It's not a bed, it's a trampoline!
Sergio:::  Hey, I found Carl's cash!
Carl::: I have got to get out of here.
Carlos::: Out of my way, little dude!
Carl::: Finally, some peace and quiet.  Ah!  Uh... Hey, bird buds? Could you go party somewhere else? I gotta get some sleep.
Sergio::: What? Turn up the music? Okay.
Carl::: Hey, that's my DJ gear!
Sergio::: Party like it's New Year's? Okay!
Carl::: What have I done?! I've gotta get these chanclas back to Abuela. She'll fix everything!  Gotta get the chanclas!  Where'd they go?!  Lalo?!  Give me those chanclas, Lalo!
Sergio:::  You can't take away our freedom!
Carl::: Ah-ha! Got 'em! Party's over.
Everyone:::  Give us the chanclas! Give us the chanclas! Give us the chanclas! Give us the chanclas!
Carl::: Come on, chanclas, do your thing.
Everyone::: No!
Sergio::: Chancla smoothie, anyone?
Everyone except Carl::: Chancla, uno! Chancla, dos! Time to say adiós!
Carl::: NOOOOOO!  Come back, chanclas! Come back!  Wait, it was a dream?  It was a dream!  Chancla flavored.
Rosa::: Buenos días, Mijo. Sit down for breakfast.
Carl::: Right, Abuela. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  Ooh, are we having veggies? I love veggies! 
Rosa:::  Are you okay? Did you sleep alright?
Carl::: Oh, well, I did have a bad dream.  Hey! Behave! Abuela is trying to serve us breakfast!
CJ::: What?
Rosa::: See, Mijo? You don't need the force of the chancla to behave like a good boy. Goodness is inside you already.
Carl:::  Oh, okay. Here are your chanclas, abuela.
Rosa::: Thank you, Carl. I got this.
