Rita::: Thanks for breakfast, honey.  I should be back around four after I finish pulling Flip's wisdom teeth.
Lynn Sr.::: I thought you already did that.
Rita::: He grew another set.
Lynn Sr.::: What?
Rita::: You know, I was thinking, the kids have been really good this week, haven't they?
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, they've been great. No calls from school...
Rita::: No trips to the ER...
Lynn Sr.::: I only had to raise my voice once.
Rita::: We should do something special for the kids. How about taking them out for ice cream when I get back?
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, I love it! We could go to Auntie Pam's Parlor!
Rita:::  And you know what? I think someone's ready for her first taste of ice cream!
Lynn Sr.::: Oh! This is my favorite of all the milestones!  What do you think, sweetie? You wanna try some...  ice cream?
Lily:::  Huh? Ice ceam?
Rita::: So, ice cream sounds good?
Lynn Sr.::: Darn tootin'! If today goes okay, too.
Rita:::  Let's see if your siblings can behave for just a few more hours.  'Cause if they can, it's ice cream time!
Imaginary Lisa::: Don't touch my glasses!
Imaginary Lynn::: I can't believe you...
Imaginary Lola::: Leni,...
Lily:::  Wah-wah! 
Lincoln::: Uh, Lily, is everything okay?
Leni:::  Isn't this cute? Lily's calling a sibling meeting.
Lola::: Good job, Lily. You drew an... upside-down tree.
Lincoln::: I think she's trying to tell us something.
Lisa::: Perhaps the infant has some trapped wind.
Lola::: You guys are all wrong; she's clearly waving at us.
Leni::: I guess Lily called this meeting just to say hi.  Hi, Lily!
Lily's siblings except Leni:::  Hi, Lily!
Leni & Lola::: Okay...
Leni::: ...well,
Lily's siblings::: Bye, Lily!
Lynn Sr.:::  Checking the mail, skippa-dee-bop. What did we get in the latest crop? 
Imaginary Lynn Sr.::: Doo-be-doo--  Ow, ow, ow! Oh, ow!  Whoa!  No more ice cream!
Lynn Sr.:::  Maybe a card. Maybe a bill  Checking the mail is always a thrill. Doo doo doo ba-da-ba-da! Doodley doo doo doo-- 
Clyde:::  Lincoln! I've got a code denim!
Lincoln::: You're stuck in a pair of skinny jeans?!
Clyde::: I was trying to update my look, but now I can't feel my legs!
Lincoln:::  Mopping the floor can wait. I'm on my way!  Don't struggle, Clyde, it'll only make it worse.
Lola::: I wanna watch my pageant show!
Lana::: I wanna watch my penguin show!
Lana::: Got it!
Lola::: Give it to me!
Lynn::: Lynn Loud looks downfield, but nobody's open! She's going for the quarterback sneak!
Lily::: Huh?
Luan::: If all goes accordion to plan, my family will glove this prank!
Imaginary Rita:::  No more ice cream!
Woman on TV::: And now, back to Penguin Pageants!
Lana and Lola::: Huh?
Luan:::  Walt, knock it off!
Lynn::: Oh no, it's a fumble! 
Rita::: Well, this is nice to see everybody getting along.  And Luan's even taking a nap.
Lynn Sr.:::  Yep, they've been perfect all day. Not a single mess or meltdown.
Rita::: That's all I needed to hear.  Kids, come down here, please!  Do you want to tell them the surprise or should I?
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, you do it.
Rita::: You guys have been so well-behaved this week, we wanted to do... -Luan, wake up! -  something nice for you...  ...so everybody get in Vanzilla, because...
Lynn Sr.:::  I changed my mind! I wanna tell them! We're going for ice cream!
Lynn Sr.::: Ketch-up, my little tomatoes. Time to head out!
Advert::: Come beat the heat at Auntie Pam's Parlor, but make sure you get there by five...  ...we're closing early to give our scoopers a break. Don't forget, 5 PM! One more time; 5 PM!  5 PM!
Lynn Sr.:::  I know, sweetie; I'm excited for ice cream, too. 
GPS::: Your estimated arrival time at Auntie Pam's Parlor is 4:46 PM.
Imaginary Cherry::: See you soon, Lily! 
Lily:::  Cherry...
Rita::: There's never this much traffic on this street.
GPS::: Your new estimated arrival time is 5:05 PM.
Lynn Sr.::: No biggie.  Auntie Pam's doesn't close 'til 8.  Oh, you wanna play with Daddy's phone, Lily?  Ok, but please don't call Aunt Ruth again. It's two hours I'll never get back.
GPS::: Rerouting. Make a U-turn onto Oakville Road.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, look at that.  Lily accidentally found us a faster route.
GPS::: Your new estimated arrival time is 4:52 PM.
Rita:::  Shoot, what now? 
Cop::: Ma'am, did you know your registration's expired? I'll have to write you a ticket for that. Get comfy; this could take a while.
Cop:::  Ahh! My bike! Come back, precious!
Rita::: Uh.  Thanks, officer! We'll take that as a warning! Whoo! 
GPS::: Your new estimated arrival time is 4:58 PM.
Lily::: Phew!
GPS::: You have arrived at your destination.
Lynn Sr.:::  Uh-oh.
Rita:::  Oh, honey. Please tell me you didn't forget your wallet. This place only takes cash. 
Lynn Sr.:::  The emergency $20! Lily, you've done it again!
Lily's siblings:::  Yay, Lily!
Rita::: Hi, can I get one scoop of vanilla ice cream, please?  Haha, okay, I guess she has other ideas. One sundae, please.
Lori::: You ready, Lily? Okay, guys, I'm recording.
Lynn Sr.:::  I can't believe this is the last time we get to introduce a little Loud to ice cream!
Lily's siblings:::  Go, Lily!
Rita::: Oh, no. Sweetie, don't worry. We'll get you a new sundae.  Uh, excuse me!
Luna::: No dice, dudes, they close at 5 this week.
Lynn Sr.:::  What? Huh, you think they'd advertise something like that.
Rita:::  Oh, poor baby. Let's get you home.
Lily's siblings, except Luan and Lana::: Oh, it's okay, Lily.
Luan::: Cheer up, Lily.
Lana::: Oh, Lily...
Leni::: I've never seen Lily look so sad.
Luan:::  You'll get that ice cream sundae, Lily. Perhaps when the road isn't so rocky! Don't have a mint chip on your shoulder about this.
Lola:::  Luan, read the room!
Rita::: It's okay, honey; we'll be home soon.
Lucy:::  Oh, what is that? It smells like a thousand angry skunks.
Rita:::  Oh, somebody needs a diaper change, stat! 
Lynn Sr.:::  A little powder, a little wipey, now you've got a fresh new diapie!  We've got a runner!
Rita:::  Look what Lily found!
Lincoln::: That gives me an idea.
Lynn Sr.:::  One ice cream sundae coming up!
Lincoln::: Don't forget the gummi bears! 
Lynn::: Whipped topping in the hizz-ouse! 
Lola::: And some yummy cookie crumbles!
Rita:::  Thanks, Flip, but you're not supposed to be talking after your wisdom teeth surgery. 
Luan::: You guys, she's about to try it!
Lisa::: Hmm, if I didn't know better, I'd swear Lily orchestrated this whole thing.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, don't be silly, honey. She's just a baby. Haha.
