Lynn::: “I got it!” 
Clyde::: “Sorry Lynn, I don’t mean to be rude, but it’s an emergency!” 
Lana::: “I don't know why he didn't just pee outside. I would if I could.
Loud girls except Lily, Lynn and Lana::: We know!
Clyde:::  Lincoln! 
Lincoln::: Clyde, it's okay!  Take your time. 
Clyde::: Whoo! Thanks buddy.
Rita:::  Lana, not on the begonias!
Clyde:::  Look! I got the program for tomorrow's Ace Savvy convention!  Check out the prize for best cosplay!
Lincoln:::  The con-goers with the most authentic character portrayals will be named Kings of the Con and win a cameo in the next Ace Savvy movie!  The movie?
Singers::: Ace and Jack!
Lincoln and Clyde::: Time to deal out some justice!
Director::: Cut! That was brilliant!
Lincoln::: We have to win! 
Clyde::: I know! We're the biggest Ace Savvy fans ever! Who else can say they wrote an issue of the comic? 
Lincoln::: Just one tiny problem...  Do you think our Ace and Jack costumes are good enough to win? 
Clyde::: Well... I did just upgrade my Poker-Chip blaster!  Whoops... I'll re-calibrate it. 
Lincoln::: That'll definitely help. But you know, there will be a lot of Ace and Jacks at the con. 
Clyde::: We need something to set us apart. Something no one else has. 
Lincoln and Clyde:::  Jackpot!
Lincoln::: Thank you for joining me.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... someone's missing? 
Lynn:::  What's the deali-o, Stinkin? I'm in the middle of a set! 
Lincoln::: Have a seat. 
Lynn::: Yeah.  
Lincoln::: As you guys know, Clyde and I are going to the Ace Savvy Convention tomorrow. 
Lori::: And...? 
Clyde::: And of course, we'll be going dressed as Ace and Jack. 
Lincoln::: But we thought... why hag all the fun? Why not invite you guys to come too, as your characters from our comic, The Full Deck. 
Narrator::: The Full Deck! Featuring, The High Card, The Eleven of Hearts, The Night Club, The Joker, The Strong Suit, The Eight of Spades, The Royal Flush, The Queen of Diamonds, The Card Counter, The Deuce!  
Lincoln::: Wa- wa- wait! Did we mention that if we win this cosplay we get to be in the next Ace Savvy movie? 
Lori::: Movie? Like, a real one? 
Lucy::: Not the kind you and Clyde make in the backyard with your little toys. 
Lincoln::: They're called action figures, and no, this is the real thing. On the big screen! 
Luna::: That's like a huge deal! 
Lola::: I will prance around at your weird convention all day for the chance to be in a Hollywood movie! 
Lincoln::: Fantastic! Okay, if we're going to win, we need to turn you into Ace Savvy experts! 
Lincoln::: The Fortress of Solitaire.  The Ace Signal. 
Clyde::: And the latest in front inside, airbag technology- 
Lincoln::: Hey! You guys were supposed to silence your phones. Who are you even texting? 
Lori::: Leni, that's not how you spell bored. 
Leni::: Sorry guys, but we've been listening for hours. When do we get to the costumes? 
Lincoln::: You guys look perfect! To the con! 
Luna::: Woohoo! Rock 'n roll!  
Lincoln::: Nice use of your jetpack, Night Club!
Lori::: This is actually pretty cool. 
Lucy::: Wow. This is incredible. 
Leni::: What's that? 
Lisa::: Hmm. Interesting. 
Luan::: Wow! 
Lana::: Ooh, it's a creature. 
Lola::: That outfit, I want it! 
Wild Card Willy Cosplayer::: Hey, pal! You gotta wait in line to see the Kitty, just like everybody else. No cuts! 
Lana::: Who's the Kitty? Is it a real cat? 
Lincoln::: Lana, we went over this in our presentation. 
Clyde::: He's the most vicious villain in the Ace Savvy universe. 
Lana:::  Oh, I have to pet him! 
Lincoln::: Sorry Lans, no time.  We gotta focus on impressing the judges. They decide who wins 'Kings of the Con', so keep your eyes peeled for two people in orange vests. 
Leni::: Would you say it's a traffic cone orange, or more of a clementine? 
Lincoln::: Good job, Leni. Action poses, go! 
Female Judge::: Oh, wow. This must be the Full Deck from Issue #415. Very impressive. 
Clyde::: Ow! My chip!  
Male Judge::: Ah!  
Clyde::: Sorry. 
Clyde::: Well, the important thing is, we got their attention, and they really seem to like your sisters. 
Lincoln::: True. And when they stand out, it's good for all of us. We're one step closer to being in our movie! 
Clyde::: Wish I could just, fix this belt! 
Guessing Booth Attendant::: Is anyone around here savvy enough to ace this challenge? Try this How Much This Jar of Pokers Chips is Worth, and win a gold poker chip! 
Lincoln::: Ooh, here's the chance to impress the judges. 
Clyde::: Ace and Jack are on the case! 
Lincoln::: So, if the green chips are worth 25 dollars... 
Clyde::: And we have to think about the volume of the jar, minus the air, plus the- 
Lisa::: That's 7,652 dollars. And if you give me a moment, I can convert it to cryptocurrency. 
Guessing Booth Attendant::: Wow. You're exactly right! 
Female Judge::: Impressive work! You really live up to your name, Card Counter. 
Lisa::: Thank you. Though the credit from my character belongs to my brother, Lincoln, and his compatriot, Clyde. 
Clyde::: Co-authors of Issue 415! 
Lincoln::: Happy to sign a copy for you- Ugh, this pen! 
Lincoln::: Okay, guys. We gotta get back in front of those judges. 
Clyde::: I don't see them anywhere. 
Lincoln:::  Clyde! 
Clyde:::  Uh, there! They were in my blind spot. 
Hammer Booth Attendant::: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! Try out the Hammer of Justice! Impress everyone with your super strength! Step right up! 
Lincoln::: Perfect. Here's our chance to make up for last time. 
Clyde::: Careful, Ace. Go easy on 'em. 
Hammer of Justice Meter::: You are as strong as the Old Maid.  
Lynn:::  Don't worry, Stinkin'. I'll teach this game for calling you old.  
Male Judge::: Wow! Guess that's why they call her the Strong Suit. Let's get a picture. 
Female Judge::: How about one with the Full Deck? Get in here, girls. 
Judges & Sisters::: Selfie!  
Lincoln:::  Well, even if we have to ride my sister's coattails, we'll still be in the movie. 
Clyde::: You're right. Just keep picturing our name in lights. 
Female Judge::: Okay, I know the day's not over yet, but for me, there's a clear winner for Kings of the Con. 
Male Judge::: Same here. Okay, say your pick on three. One, two... 
Judges::: The Full Deck! 
Clyde:::  
Lincoln::: Yes! 
Female Judge::: But what about that Ace and Jack they're with? 
Male Judge::: I'm not that impressed. I don't think we need to include them. 
Female Judge::: Hey, you wanna take a break in the judge's lounge? I hear there's donuts. 
Male Judge::: Oh, yeah! 
Lincoln & Clyde:::  Noooooooo! 
Lincoln::: I can't believe this! My sisters are going to be in the movie and we're not!? They wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for us. 
Clyde::: Don't give up, buddy. We got this. The judges haven't made their final decision yet. 
Lincoln::: You're right. We still have time to show them what Ace and Jack can do. 
Lisa::: No Thanks. They’re charging 12 bucks for a corn dog and a cape. 
Lola:::  Well, in that case... 
Sisters::: Thanks! 
Lincoln::: There goes all my souvenir money. 
Clyde::: Sorry, buddy. It'll be worth it. Now where'd those judges go? 
Dunk Tank Attendant::: Get your revenge and dunk the Card Shark! 
Card Shark:::  
Lincoln::: Bingo. Here's our chance to wow them. 
Clyde::: I got this. I'll turn my blaster from ding to demolish. 
Lincoln:::  Watch out, Card Shark. You're about to get Jacked! 
Clyde::: Hi-ya!  
Lincoln::: T-try it again. 
Lincoln::: Here, just use this. 
Card Shark::: Wow, kid. 
Lincoln::: Wait! Uhh, we got something here. 
Card Shark:::  Uh-oh. 
Clyde::: Well, if the judges had stuck around, I think they would've been impressed with our mopping. 
Lincoln::: Don't worry, Clyde. We'll find another way to wow them. 
High Roller Attendant::: High Roller fans, huh? You boys wanna see what it feels like to sit inside? 
Clyde::: This is our chance. We can show off our encyclopedic knowledge of Ace and Jack's custom ride. 
Clyde & Lincoln::: Yes, we do! 
Lincoln::: Engaging camouflage mode!  Whoops! It's a little different from the movie. 
High Roller Attendant:::  Actually, boys. I prefer if you didn't... 
Clyde::: Engaging flight propellers!  
Lincoln::: Uhh, maybe it's this. 
Clyde::: Uh, maybe this? 
Lincoln::: Well, now I'm pretty sure the judges hate us. If we're gonna turn this around, we've gotta think of something brilliant. 
Clyde::: Yeah, and we've only got an hour to do it. 
Lincoln::: It's gotta be something big. 
Clyde::: Something only Ace and Jack can do. Something like... 
Lincoln::: Solving a crime! 
Clyde::: Ooh, now that's brilliant. But where do we find a crime to solve? 
Lincoln::: We make one. 
Lincoln::: No one will hear us in here. Now to think of the perfect crime to solve. 
Clyde::: I'll get us the deluxe package to buy us extra time.  Plus, it comes with all these fun backgrounds. 
Announcer::: Attention all con-goers: sorry to disappoint, but the Kitty is officially done signing autographs. 
Clyde::: Darn. I was kinda still hoping we'd squeeze that in. 
Lincoln::: Wait, Clyde, that's it! Let's catnap the Kitty. 
Clyde::: I know we want an autograph, but... 
Lincoln::: No, I mean, this is the perfect crime to get the judges' attention. 
Clyde::: Hmm. Normally, this level of deception would give me a stomachache, but we have no choice. 
Lincoln::: All we'd have to do is hide the Kitty for a while, let the panic build up, then you and I track him down and rescue him. 
Clyde::: We'd be heroes. The judges will forget all about the Full Deck and name us Kings of the Con. 
Lincoln::: Come on, the Kitty's trailer is this way. 
Clyde::: Wait, our pictures!  Oh, look! This is the one where you got your idea, and this one is where I was questioning it. 
Kitty's Trainer::: The Kitty's not taking a dime less than what the Card Shark's making. 
Lincoln::: Are you sure you don't need backup? 
Clyde::: I got this. Nana Gayle calls me the cat whisperer.  Hello, Mr. The Kitty, sir. Would you mind getting in this crate? Or, as you might say, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. 
Clyde::: Not my Crime Eye!  Let's move on to plan B. 
Clyde::: Sorry to bother you, but some sponsors wanted to send over a complimentary caviar dinner. We've got it all set up over here. 
Clyde::: Here's our tasting menu. Might I recommend the... now, Lincoln! 
Lincoln::: Whew, we did it! 
The Kitty:::  
Lincoln::: Maybe we should give him some alone time. 
Clyde::: To being Kings of the Con! 
Lincoln::: We just pulled off the biggest heist of all time. 
Announcer::: Attention, con-goers; the Kitty has gone missing. If you encounter him, please do not engage. He is highly stunt-trained and really dangerous. 
Lincoln::: Okay, time to be heroes. 
Lincoln::: Oh no!  He escaped! He must've picked the lock with his claws, just like in the fourth Ace movie, Meow You See Me. 
Clyde::: What do we do meow? I mean, now? 
Lincoln::: Well, technically, we can still be the ones to rescue the Kitty. We just made our jobs a lot harder. 
Clyde::: True, but maybe my cat knowledge can help us. Come on! 
Lincoln::: So cats really like popcorn? 
Clyde::: Big time. At my house, we can barely get through a movie without a cat getting in a bowl. 
Clyde::: It's working! 
Clyde::: No, no, no, no, no! Why did I add that feature? 
Clyde::: Uh, did you know the Kitty could actually shoot hairballs? I thought it was all special effects. 
Clyde::: Got our supplies. One Ace and Jack flying drone, one Ace and Jack pillow, and one Old Maid jumbo pencil. 
Lincoln::: That was all of your souvenir money, wasn't it? 
Clyde::: It's okay. It had to be done.  
Lincoln::: Hey, not bad! You think he'll fall for it? 
Clyde::: Oh, yeah. My cats attack anything with feathers. My dad had to get rid of his fun hat collection. 
Lincoln::: Okay, Kitty, come and get it! 
Lincoln::: Oh no! Surprise aerial attack! 
Lincoln::: Good thing I brought back-up!  Really? That did nothing? 
Clyde::: It messed up his fur a little. 
Lincoln::: He's armed with catnip! Hit the deck!  Dang it, he gave us the slip! 
Clyde:::  Or did he? Looks like someone is shedding for the summer.  Follow that fur! 
Lincoln::: Clyde, up there!  
Clyde::: Wait, it's just rope! 
Clyde::: Take this!  Darn, I only had four chips left. You mind throwing those back?  
Lincoln::: Uh oh, he's reloading! Go, go go!  
Lincoln::: Oh no, Clyde! I'm stuck! 
Clyde::: Me too! What do we do now? 
Clyde::: Ah, no one can hear our cries over the pumping of that sick bass. 
Lincoln::: I've got an idea. Can you help me get my mask off?  Fling it at that light. We're sending my sisters a signal. 
Teen Girl::: Thanks. 
Lori::: Lemme just check it before you tag us.  I always have double chins in these pics. 
Leni::: What's that in the background?  
Lisa::: Does no one remember this from our con prep? That mask means Ace and Jack are in trouble. Someone needs our help. 
Lynn::: Well, what the junk are we standing around for? Let's go save some butt! 
Luan::: It looks like the signal is coming from that stage. 
Lola::: How are we gonna get over there? 
Luna::: On it, dudes.  
Luan::: Well, that's great for Luna, but what about the rest of us? 
Lori::: Oh, I've got an idea.  Oh, shoot! Where's the windshield wipers? Uh, this one?  Yes! Nailed it! 
Lola::: Lori, watch out!  
Lori::: Oh no!  
Luna::: Dudes, it's Lincoln and Clyde! They're up there!  
Leni:::  Wait for me! 
Clyde::: Lincoln, if this is really the end, I gotta tell you. I went to Dairyland with Rusty once.  It was only cause you were grounded. 
Lincoln::: It's okay, buddy. 
Lynn::: Yo, furball, down here! 
Lincoln::: Kitty, meet your worst nightmare. 
Narrator::: THE FULL DECK!! 
Lynn::: A little help, Eight of Spades? 
Lucy::: Gladly, Strong Suit.  Throw.  
Lori::: I'll grab the boys.  Lincoln! Clyde! 
Lisa::: Hi-ya!  Ohh, you birdbrains couldn't think of a better weapon than an abacus?  Oh, never mind. It's actually quite effective. 
Lori:::  Ew, gross! Hairballs! I thought it was Lana’s Job to deal with these. 
Lana::: Save me one would ya.  Prepare to face the Royal Flush!  Aww, you're such a cute boy. Why are you so feisty? Do you need a hug?  
Lola::: Hey! No one donkey kicks Lana but me!  
Leni:::  Guys, I figured it out! I'm free!  
Luan::: Hang on, Leni! The Joker will save you from this cat-tastrophy.  
Lincoln::: Give it up, Kitty. This ends now.  
Clyde::: Oh no! Litter cloud! 
Lily::: Kee-kee! No! No! 
Clyde::: We've been saved by the Deuce! 
Lincoln::: Yay, Lily! 
Clyde::: Ace, the crate! 
Lincoln::: Keep 'em coming, Lily. 
Lincoln::: Nice job, Jack. 
Lana::: Are you guys sure we have to crate him? I think he was just playing. 
Everyone::: Lana! 
Male Judge::: We heard fighting! 
Female Judge::: What is going on over here?  You boys found the Kitty! 
Male Judge::: You're heroes! Ohh, just like the real Ace and Jack.  
Female Judge::: Well, I think it's safe to say we have found our Kings of the Con!  
Lola::: Wait, so we're out of the movie? 
Lori::: I guess so. 
Lincoln::: Um, we need to say something. It's just... we don't exactly deserve to be Kings of the Con. 
Judges::: Huh? 
Clyde::: We found out the Full Deck was gonna win it without us, so we catnapped the Kitty so we could rescue him and impress you. 
Lincoln::: We just really wanted to be in the movie.  But now we can see how dumb that was, and we're so sorry. 
Clyde::: Especially to you, Mr. The Kitty, sir. Still a huge fan.  
Lincoln::: Watching you guys in action was incredible. You really do deserve to be Kings of the Con.  
Female Judge:::  Well, I think you two can exit the stage now.  Can we get the girls over here?  
Male Judge::: Okay, the Full Deck is officially Kings of the Con! And that's final.  
Luna::: Whoa! Stage dive!  
Female Judge::: Smile big, everybody. This is for the movie press release. 
Lola::: Get a better angle! 
Lana::: Get me picking my nose! 
Female Judge:::  You boys ready for your photo? 
Lincoln::: What photo? 
Male Judge::: You're in the movie too. 
Female Judge::: We don't condone what you did, but you really made a splash with the fans, so we came up with a small role for you. 
Lincoln::: What is it? 
Clyde::: Ace and Jack's crime-fighting nephews? 
Male Judge::: Nope. The Kitty's personal pooper-scoopers. He's really looking forward to working with you.
