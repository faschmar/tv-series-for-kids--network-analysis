Rita::: Kids, let’s go! You're late for school.
Lynn Sr::: Woo!
Rita::: Oh, lookin' good, sweetie.
Lynn Sr.::: Thanks, honey. I'm ready to ring in the funk at Cowbella. Two days of nothing but cowbell music, can you imagine?
Rita::: Not in a million years. I hope you and Kotaro have a wonderful time.  Could you guys do me a favor and drop Lily at daycare on your way? I got my hands full today. 
Lily:::  Bah bell.
Lynn Sr.::: That's right, sweetie.  Aah, watch the drool.  It rusts.
Lynn Sr.::: Come on, K-Dog. Don't wanna miss the Red Hot Bell Peppers. 
Rita:::  Hi, honey. What's-
Lynn Sr.::: Emergency! Daycare is closed for the day. The Koch kid flushed a diaper down the toilet again and flooded the place. Can you come home and watch Lily?
Rita::: Oh, honey, my day is packed. The Fox quintuplets are all getting their cavities filled and we only have enough gas for four of them.
Pam:::  Wh-what?
Rita::: Whoops.  Don't worry about that, sweetie.
Lynn Sr.::: How about I drop Lily there, huh? I'm sure she'll be fine around all those sharp dental tools.
Rita::: I think you're gonna have to skip the music festival today.  I'm sorry, honey, you can still go tomorrow. Gotta run, okay? Good luck.
Lynn Sr.:::  Okay, Lily. Daddy needs to call Uncle Kotaro and cancel Cowbella. I'll try not to hold it against you, I mean, it's not technically your fault.  Maybe I don't need to cancel. Hello, Mr. Grouse! Lovely day, isn't it?
Mr. Grouse::: It'd be a whole lot better if my gout wasn't flaring up.
Lynn Sr.::: Ahh, cool, cool. Uh, say, how would you like to spend this beautiful day at my house babysitting this adorable ragamuffin, huh?
Lily::: Goo-goo.
Mr. Grouse::: I don't know anything about babies, except they don't like me.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, no, there's nothing to it, and Lily'll love you. Heck, she already does, don't you, Lily?  See? Tears of love.
Mr. Grouse::: Nice try, Loud, I'm not running a kennel here. 
Lynn Sr.:::  I'll make you a lasagna~.
Mr. Grouse:::  Ten lasagnas.
Lynn Sr.::: Three.
Mr. Grouse::: Seven.
Lynn Sr. & Mr. Grouse::: Five! Deal!
Lynn Sr.:::  Here's everything you need. Call me if there's any problems.
Kotaro::: Hey, Lily. Hi, Mr. Grouse.  You ready to ring it and ding it, Lynn?
Lynn Sr.:::  You bet your bells I am!
Mr. Grouse::: Whoa, whoa, whoa, how about ringing it and dinging it in the van there, pal?
Lynn Sr.::: Cool.  Bye, honey. Be good for Mr. Grouse. Whoo!
Mr. Grouse::: It's just you and me, kiddo. How are we gonna spend the day?
Lily::: Poo-poo.
Mr. Grouse::: Ah, that's not what I wanted to hear.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, excuse me, ah, pardon me, O-ow! Ow!
Mr. Grouse::: Loud, your daughter won’t stop crying. I turned off my hearing aid, but I can still hear her! You gotta come home.
Lynn Sr.::: Now, now, Mr. Grouse, no need to panic. It’s just a easy fix, okay? Just speak to her with a British accent.
Mr. Grouse::: Oh yeah, I could do that, or you could just get your butt back here.
Lynn Sr.:::  Give it a try. I'll guide you through it, okay?  Cheerio! Jolly good! Pip pip!
Mr. Grouse::: This is ridiculous.  Cheerio. Jolly good. I forget the rest.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, there you go! You're a natural!
Mr. Grouse::: I wouldn't mind another lasagna for my troubles.
Lynn Sr.::: You got it! 
Kotaro::: Woooo!
Mr. Grouse::: Loud, your crazy daughter won't stop throwing her toys at me.  I'm not doing this anymore!
Lynn Sr.:::  No, no, no, hold on. No need to overreact. Uh, this is just Lily's mid-day cranky time. Try doing pratfalls. Always works for me.
Mr. Grouse:::  Fat chance, Loud. At my age, if I go down, I stay down.
Lynn Sr.::: Ahh--what if I throw in another lasagna?
Mr. Grouse::: And I'm falling.
Lynn Sr.:::  Hey, Lily sounds good.
Mr. Grouse::: Yeah, better than me. I landed on some jacks.
Lynn Sr.::: Cool, cool. 
Mr. Grouse:::  Loud, your kid won't eat anything I give her.  I’m done! You need to get back here!
Lynn Sr.::: Ah, easy, Mr. G. She's just fussy. I keep some homemade peach puree in the fridge for times just like this.
Mr. Grouse:::  Meh. Homemade peach puree, why didn't you say that in the first place?  Whoa, she gobbled that right up.
Lynn Sr.::: Ah, that's a relief. Oh! And speaking of relief, it's my turn. 
Mr. Grouse::: GAH! For Pete's sake, Loud! Hang up!
Lynn Sr.:::  Ding, dong, dang it.  Okay, Mr. Grouse, you win. I'm on my way home.
Mr. Grouse::: What? Why? Everything's swell.
Lynn Sr.:::  I, but, it is?
Mr. Grouse::: You bet, we're having a gas. I was just calling because the little tyke spit up on my shirt. You mind if I borrow one of your sweaters?
Mr. Grouse::: Good, 'cause I already did.  I won't bother you again, Loud. Enjoy your silly bell thing.
Kotaro::: Should I get the van?
Lynn Sr.::: Bell no. We're good for the rest of the day.
Kotaro::: Sweet.
Lynn Sr.::: WOO-HOO!
Kotaro::: WOOO-HOO! I can't wait for tomorrow!
Lynn Sr.::: Me neither, K-Dog! Day two!  Here you go, Mr. Grouse. Seven trays of lasagna, as promised. Looks like this worked out bell for both of us. 
Lily::: Dada. Dada!
Lynn Sr.:::  No, no, no, that's Mr. Grouse, sweetie. I'm Dada.
Lily:::  Dada! Dada!
Mr. Grouse::: Aww, isn't that cute? She thinks I'm her Dada.
Lynn Sr.:::  Yes, yeah, downright adorable. 
Lily::: Dada! Dada!
Lynn Sr.::: OK, sweetie, that-that-that's enough of that. 
Lily::: Dada!  Dada! Dada!  Dadaaaaaa.
Lynn Sr.:::  What have I done?
Rita::: Honey, are you okay? How was your day with Lily?
Lynn Sr.:::  I have a confession to make, I went to Cowbella and left her with Mr. Grouse.
Rita:::  Lynn!
Lynn Sr.:::  Before you get mad at me, I'm already paying for it. Lily got along so well with Mr. Grouse...  ...and now she's calling him Dada. 
Rita::: Oh, honey, Lily is just getting used to words, she probably doesn't know who any of us are yet.
Lynn Sr.::: You think so? Maybe I'm overre-
Lily:::  Mama!  Mama, mama!
Lynn Sr.::: I lost her!
Rita:::  We need to work on your timing, sweetheart.
Rita:::  Okay kids, let's go!  Honey, we're off! I just called the day care and they're open, can you drop Lily off before Cowbella?
Lynn Sr.:::  That's a negative! I'm not going to Cowbella. I have something more important to do today,  win my daughter back!
Rita:::  Win her back? Lynn, you're making too much of this.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh! It's easy for you to say. She still loves you.  Okay Lily, time for Operation: Remind You I'm Your Daddy And That Guy Next Door Is Just An Old Coot With A Bad Lasagna Addiction.
Lynn Sr.::: ...and the pig, and the goat, lived 'appily eve' afta'. The end. Bob's your uncle, Grouse isn't your father, pip pip.  Ba-da-da, da-da-da-, and boom, there, all clean.  Ow!   Landed on some jacks, but totally worth it.  Here you go honey. Daddy's homemade peach puree.  So, just to review: I'm daddy. This is my peach puree, and I made it just for you.  Ah, yeah, yeah, you like it now, wait 'til I put sprinkles on it.  Sure they're bad for her teeth, but I'm waging a war here.  Uh, Lily? 
Lily:::  Dada. Dada!
Lynn Sr.:::  Dang it!
Lynn Sr.::: Well, if I'm gonna win you back, I gotta get you away from that geezer's magnetic pull.
Lily::: Oons, ah-ba-oons.
Lynn Sr.:::  You want a balloon?  Daddy's on it.  Mr. Grouse probably would only buy you one balloon, but your real daddy thinks you deserve them all.
Lily::: Teddy.
Lynn Sr.::: You want a new teddy bear? Daddy's got you covered.  Mr. Grouse probably would've bought you that rinky-dink one. Real daddy goes the extra mile.
Lily::: Goo. 
Lynn Sr.::: That's fun, isn't it? And real daddy will do this all day if you want.
Lily::: Dada!
Lynn Sr.:::  Ah! That's right! I- I'm Dada.  You did it Lynn, you got her back. 
Lily::: Dada!
Lynn Sr.::: Yes! Yes! Yes! I'm Dada! Underdog! 
Lily:::  Dada!  Dada.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh... Argh! You're breaking your father's heart.  And his nose.
Lynn Sr.:::  I chose Cowbella, over my daughter and now I've lost her forever.
Rita::: Honey...
Lynn Sr.::: Uh, it's-it's alright. The most important thing... is that Lily is-is happy, and if that means spending time with Mr. Grouse instead of me, then I'll just have to... accept that.  Hello. Mr. Grouse?  Uh, I was wondering if you'd let-  Lynn, Lynn Loud. Yeah, I was wondering if you'd like to-to come over for-for dinner tonight. I know Lily... I know Lily would love to see you.  Yes, fine, we'll have lasagna.
Mr. Grouse::: Hey there, Loud. Took my gout pills and I'm ready to eat.  Here's your sweater back. Didn't have time to wash it, didn't feel like it either.
Lynn Sr.::: Okay...  Lily, say hi to-
Lily::: Dada!
Lynn Sr.:::  Yes, I know you think Mr. Grouse is-
Lily::: Dada.  Dada!
Lynn Sr.::: Wait, me? I don't understand. What's happening?
Lily:::  Dada! Dada, dada.
Rita::: Honey, I get what's going on. Mr. Grouse was wearing your favorite sweater. That's why Lily was calling him Dada!
Lynn Sr.:::  Holy smokes, you're right!  What a relief. You hear that, Mr. Grouse? She knows I'm her dad! Isn't that wonderful?!
Mr. Grouse::: Cool, cool. You got any pepper flakes?
