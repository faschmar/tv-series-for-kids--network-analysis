Lincoln:::  It's the day before Christmas  and there's no better time to be in the Loud House. 
Luna:::  Christmas time is totally rad. I want those gifts, so I won't be bad!  Aww! Come on!
Lincoln::: Having trouble with this year's Christmas song, Luna?
Luna::: Bro, I'm stuck like Santa in a chimney!  Ooh! That's not bad!  I'm stuck like Santa in a chimney! I've been good all year, so gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!  Aww, rubbish!
Luan:::  I'll say! Those lyrics make no frankincense!  That's one!  My twelve puns of Christmas are off to a great start. I've only got to come up with eleven myrrh!  Make that ten! 
Leni:::  Hey, Lincoln! I just made the perfect Christmas outfit.
Rita:::  Hey, has anyone seen my plaid Christmas table cloth?
Lori:::  Oh, don't worry about buying me a gift, Bobby Boo-Boo Bear. I mean, sure, it's our very first Christmas together  and I'll probably remember what you give me for the rest of our lives, but no pressure.
Bobby:::  Right. Uh, no pressure, Babe. 
Lincoln::: Oops! Wrong ones!  Excuse me. This might take a while.
Lola:::  Hey there, favorite big brother! Allow me to dive into that pile of smelly sweaty footwear and find your winter boots for you. 
Lola:::  Here you are, good sir!  Two big brother boots. Boy, these are stylish!
Lincoln:::  Okay, what do you want?
Lola:::  To get a good haul from Santa.  See, contrary to popular belief, I am no angel. So, if I'm going to get on Santa's nice list, I have one day to undo twelve months of naughty!
Lisa:::  You're wasting your time.   Factoring in sleigh speed, time zone changes, and reindeer bathroom breaks, it is scientifically impossible for this so-called Kris Kringle  to deliver gifts to the approximately one billion qualifying children. As you can see, X equals no stinkin' way. 
Lola:::  You're lucky I'm being nice right now!
Rita:::  You know what I want for Christmas? A bigger fireplace.
Luan:::  What's that, Mom? I can holly hear you!  That's three!  Lily, are you  stocking me?  That's four!
Lynn::: See anything?
Lucy::: Nope.
Lincoln::: Looking for gifts for Mom and Dad, Huh?  Have you checked Dad's underwear drawer?
Lynn:::  Have we checked Dad's underwear drawer?
Lucy::: Lincoln, please. This is not our first rodeo.
Lynn Sr.:::  Dashing to the stove...  Hey, son! You're just in time to try the Crown Jewel of Ol' Dad's Christmas Eve feast......The Figgy Pudding!
Lincoln:::  And ruin the surprise at dinner? I don't think so!
Luan::: Look at Dad getting figgy with it!  Number five!
Lynn Sr.::: Ah, I love the 12 Puns of Christmas. Luan, you wanna try my pudding?
Luan::: Sorry, Dad. Yule have to ask someone else. Get it? Yule? That's six! I just sleigh myself! Ooh, seven! 
Lynn Sr.::: Sleigh!
Lincoln:::  Yup. Everyone around here is full of Christmas cheer.
Mr. Grouse::: LOUDS! What's that awful stench?
Lincoln::: Well, everyone except for our crabby old neighbor, Mr. Grouse. He really lives up to his name. Especially around Christmas.
Mr. Grouse::: LOUDS! Turn down that annoying music! LOUDS! Shut off all those horrible lights!
Lincoln::: Sheesh.  Well, I'm not gonna let Mr. Grouse take away my Christmas cheer. I've got a week off school, ten inches of fresh snow, and this guy!  The Fearsome Flyer 8000! Or as I affectionately call him, Big Red. We've been waiting all winter for the perfect sledding conditions. So if you'll excuse us... 
Lana::: Woo-hoo! My reindeer net worked! Sorry, Lincoln. I'm just getting ready for tonight.  I'm gonna catch one to keep as a pet!
Lana::: Woo-hoo! My reindeer pit worked! Uh, don't worry, buddy! I got a winch! 
Lincoln::: Now, where was I? Ah, yes. It's just you and me, Big Red.  Let's do this.  Ha ha! Yeah!
Lincoln::: Nooooooooo!  This is a disaster! When stuff goes into Mr. Grouse's yard, it never comes back.
Flashback Mr. Grouse::: My yard, my property!
Flashback Mr. Grouse::: My yard, my property!
Flashback Mr. Grouse::: My yard, my property! 
Lincoln::: Well, I'm not letting Big Red suffer the same fate. Especially on the first day of vacation. 
Mr. Grouse:::  Louds!  Take down that eyesore. You're bringing down the property values!
Lincoln::: It's too risky to go in alone. I'm going to need backup. 
Lincoln:::  Clyde, come in!
Clyde::: Hey, Lincoln! Just working on my mistletoe.  This year, I'm not gonna squander my one chance to get a holiday smooch from Lori.
Lincoln:::  I'm rootin' for you, buddy. But, can it wait? I've got a Code Six emergency!
Clyde::: Oh no! What went over the fence this time?  Was it Bobby?
Fantasy Mr. Grouse::: My yard, my property!
Fantasy Bobby::: Babe?
Lincoln:::Negative. It was Big Red!
Clyde::: Noooooooo!
Lincoln::: Put on your snow boots. It's time to put Operation Scale the Fence and Retrieve Big Red Before Mr. Grouse Finds It and Takes It Into His House Forever and Also Think of a Shorter Name For This Operation into action!
Clyde::: Sorry, I got stuck in a turtleneck. Could you repeat that? Never mind. I'm on my way. 
Lucy:::  No presents for us under here.
Lynn:::  Dang it!
Lucy::: We could look in the basement. How do you feel about lifting the water heater?
Lynn:::  Let's do this!
Lori::: I don't think Mom will mind if I just peel back the corner a little. 
Luan:::  Hold it!  You are mistletoe-tally busted!  That's eight!
Lori:::  I can't help it. The sound of the paper tearing, the smell of the tape, that moment when you stick the bow in your hair.  Gimme that!
Luan::: You gotta kick this habit, Lori. We don't want a repeat of last year.
Flashback Lori:::  You guys got some great stuff!
Lori::: You're right, Luan. I gotta fight this!
Luan::: Well, there's no time like the present!  That's nine.
Lori:::  I can be strong. I will not open another gift until Christmas morning.
Short Delivery Man::: Delivery for Miss Lori Loud. 
Lori:::  To Lori. Open immediately.  Universe, you are literally testing me.
Lana::: Woohoo!  My reindeer cage works!
Leni:::  Hey guys! Forget what I was wearing before. This is the perfect Christmas outfit.
Rita:::  Has anyone seen all my tinsel?
Leni::: 
Luan::: Oooh! I'm gonna tell!
Leni::: No no no!
Luan:::  Just ribbon ya!  That's ten!
Lola:::  Oh, mother. You've done so much to make this glorious holiday perfect. Allow me to look for the tinsel and after I find it, I'll rub your tired, aching tootsies.
Rita:::  Thank you, Lola. That's very nice of you.
Lola:::  Did you hear that, Santa? She said nice!
Lisa:::  Wasting your time...
Lola:::  Control yourself, Lola. She's not worth it.
Clyde::: Hey, Lincoln!
Lincoln:::  Clyde!
Clyde::: I'm okay! 
Lincoln::: I see you toned down the mistletoe this year.
Clyde::: Yeah. I don't want a repeat of last year.
Flashback Clyde::: Pucker up, my Christmas queen!
Clyde:::  So what's the plan?
Lincoln:::  You'll go to the front door and sing Christmas carols here. When Grouse comes out to yell at you, I'll hop the fence and grab Big Red here.
Clyde::: Strategic genius!  One question: what's that?
Lincoln:::  Ugh! Charles!
Clyde:::  Turtledove to Sled Man Walking. I'm in position.
Lincoln::: Copy that, Turtledove. Commence caroling.
Clyde:::  Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi!  Dashing through the snow. In a one-horse open sleigh
Mr. Grouse:::  Stop your off-key caterwauling! I don't care for carolers.
Clyde:::  Laughing all the way
Mr. Grouse:::  Go on! Get!  What the Sam heck was that?
Clyde:::  Don't look in the yard. There's nothing there to see. Got lots of songs to sing. So keep your eyes on meHey!
Mr. Grouse:::  My yard, my property! 
Lincoln::: I can't believe I lost Big Red.
Luna:::  Merry Christmas, honey. If you don't have a gift, I'll gladly take money. I wrote it down on my Christmas list. If I don't get my prezzies, I'm gonna get- 
Mr. Grouse::: LOUDS! KNOCK OFF THAT RACKET!!! 
Lincoln:::  Clyde! Do you see what I see?
Clyde:::  A star, a star, shining in the night?
Lincoln::: No. Mr. Grouse just left. I can sneak into his house and get my sled back.
Clyde::: What? You can't do that! That's Mr. Grouse's property.
Lincoln::: But that sled is my property. I'll just slip through the doggy door, grab Big Red, and he'll be none the wiser.
Clyde::: But what if you get caught and go to jail, and they only let family visit? You know I haven't married Lori yet, so the guards won't let me see you-
Lincoln::: CLYDE! None of that's gonna happen, because you're gonna be my lookout.
Lincoln:::  I'm in. Just keep a lookout for Grouse.
Clyde::: Don't worry. You can count on me. I'm not going anywhere. 
Lana:::  Yes! My reindeer catapult worked!  Although, it might not be the best way to catch a reindeer.
Lincoln::: Now, where would I hide a sled if I were a grumpy old sourpuss.  Big Red!  Whoa! Is that Mr. Grouse as a kid? And is he holding a Fearsome Flyer 1000?
Mr. Grouse:::  Hoo...cold.
Mr. Grouse::: Aw, dang. All out of wood.
Mr. Grouse::: Gotcha!
Lincoln:::  Big Red!
Mr. Grouse::: Serves you right, you little thief!
Lincoln::: I'm not a thief! You're the thief! You stole my sled and now it's broken!
Mr. Grouse::: My yard, my property! I'm calling your folks right now!  They'll straighten you out.
Lana::: YEEEEEES!!!
Mr. Grouse::: No one's answering. Probably can't even hear the phone over all that racket.  Till I reach your folks, you can clean up the mess you made. 
Lincoln::: Why do you have to be so mean all the time? I just wanted my sled back.  You of all people should understand that. You had one, too.
Mr. Grouse:::  Stop snoopin' and start sweepin'!  Ah, that's probably them. Get to work!  Hello? Oh, hey, Junie. Sorry I didn't call back.
Mr. Grouse:::  No, it doesn't look like I'm gonna make it back for Christmas after all. I'm sorry. I know it's been five years, but I just don't have the money to travel this Christmas.
Mr. Grouse::: Tell the girls Uncle Buddy says hi and loves them whole bunches. I miss you, too.  I thought I told you to clean up your mess!
Lincoln::: I didn't know you were from a big family.
Mr. Grouse::: What's it to ya?
Lincoln::: Well, it's just, it must be hard not to see them at Christmas.
Mr. Grouse::: Enough! Go on home! 
Lincoln::: So, you're not gonna tell my parents?
Mr. Grouse::: JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!
Clyde:::  Come in, Sled Man Walking.  Are you okay? I'm sorry I compromised the mission. One minute, I was in your yard, the next, I was six blocks away. I broke my mistletoe. So long, holiday smooch.
Lincoln::: Sorry, Turtledove. Everything's okay here though. Rescuing Big Red was a bust, but now, I've got a new mission. I'll call you back with the plan. 
Lucy::: Oh, Ghost of Christmas Past...reveal to us where the presents are hidden.
Lynn:::  What'd he say? What'd he say?
Luan::: You two definitely have the Christmas spirit!  That's eleven!
Lori:::  Can't take it any longer! MUST OPEN! 
Lana:::  Whoa, girl! 
Luna::: Guys, can you chill? I'm trying to write and I'm down to the wire!  Ooh! Maybe that's it!  Down to the wire. Santa's on fire I'm never gonna get this!
Lincoln::: Guys!
Leni::: Okay, forget that old rag I was wearing before. This is the perfect Christmas outfit!
Rita:::  What happened to the stockings? Seriously, why does everything keep disappearing?
Lincoln::: GUYS!
Leni:::  Oh, Lily, you didn't!
Lynn Sr.::: Hey hey hey! I need a taste tester for my figgy pudding!
Leni:::  Oh, phew. It wasn't you.
Lola::: I'll do it, Daddy! Your figgy pudding is always the highlight of my Christmas!  You're seeing this, right, Santa?
Lisa:::  Truly pathetic.
Lola:::  Mmm...figgy!
Lincoln::: GUYS!!! WOULD YOU JUST STOP AND LISTEN TO ME FOR A SECOND?!
Lincoln::: I was just in Mr. Grouse's House...
Lola::: That big meanie?
Leni::: He dresses, like, horribly!
Lori::: He is literally awful!
Lincoln::: He's not that bad. Well, he is, but now I think I know why.
Lincoln::: ...And then he told me to leave.
Lori:::  That is literally so sad!
Lana:::  I can't believe he has a big family, too.
Luan:::  And he can't be with them? That's awful!
Leni::: Seeing all of us together must make him miss them even more.
Lisa::: Usually, I'm impervious to human emotions, but... 
Lola:::  No wonder he's such a grumpy-butt this time of year.
Luan::: How did we not notice this?
Lori:::  Maybe because we've been so caught up in the hustle and bustle of the holidays.
Lynn::: Yeah. We were so worried about what we were getting.
Lucy:::  When we should have been worried about what we were giving.
Lola::: And isn't that what Christmas is all about?
Luna:::  Dudes! That's it! No wonder I couldn't nail my song! I've been going about it all wrong! 
Lincoln::: We need to do something for Mr. Grouse.
Sisters::: Yeah!
Lori::: But what can we do?
Lincoln::: I have a plan!  Okay, the first thing we do...
Voices::: Ooooooooh
Mr. Grouse:::  Huh? Who? What? Can't get a moment's peace. 
Lincoln::: Merry Christmas, Mr. Grouse.
Lana::: We all chipped in and got you something.
Lynn::: It's a bus ticket.
Luan::: So you can go see your family for Christmas tomorrow.
Rita::: And since you can't be with them tonight...
Rita::: ...we're bringing our family to you.
Lynn Sr.::: How 'bout it, neighbor?
Mr. Grouse:::  LOUDS!!!  You've made this the best Christmas ever. Thank you.  I'd say you all landed permanent spots on Santa's nice list.
Lola:::  Even me?
Mr. Grouse::: Even you.
Lisa::: Once again... 
Mr. Grouse::: Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone inside!
Luan::: There, Mr. Grouse. Now it's not so gloomy in here.
Lucy::: Yeah, you ruined it.
Leni::: Guys, I finally made the perfect Christmas outfit!
Leni::: It's not for me. It's for Mr. Grouse. You can wear it on your trip tomorrow. 
Mr. Grouse::: Well, thank you.  What happened to my curtains?
Lynn Sr.::: Chow time in five, people!
Mr. Grouse::: Before we sit down, there's something I'd like to say.
Lynn:::  Speech! Speech! Speech!
Mr. Grouse::: Well, I know I haven't always been the friendliest neighbor, and I'm sorry about that. You've all given me so much tonight, now I'd like to give something to you.
Lola::: We take checks.
The Loud Sisters:::  ALL OUR STUFF!!!
Lana:::  PLUNGEY!!!
Mr. Grouse:::  I'm sorry your sled was broken.
Lincoln::: That's alright. It's only a sled. I'm just glad we're friends now.
Howard:::  Oh, Hare-Bear. Isn't this the most wonderful thing you've ever seen?
Harold::: Now, Howie, remember what Dr. Lopez said about-  Oh, forget Dr. Lopez! This is the most wonderful thing I've ever seen!
Lori::: Clyde, you know what you're standing under, don't you? 
Lori::: Merry Christmas, Clyde.
Clyde:::  And to all a good night. 
Lynn Sr.::: Come on, everybody, sit! Dinner is served! And save some room for the figgy pudding!
Loud Family::: MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! 
Rita::: Well, that's all the Christmas presents. Time to start decorating for Valentine's Day!
Lori::: Wait! I still have one more!  I saved the best for last! 
Present::: Ow!
Bobby:::  Merry Christmas, Babe...
Lori:::  Boo-Boo Bear?
Bobby::: I couldn't find anything good enough to buy you for our first Christmas together, so I decided to give you myself.
Lori::: Ah. That's literally the perfect gift.  Oh, I got you a present, too.
Bobby::: I hope it's food and water.
Lisa::: Santa sure was good to us this year.
Louds::: SANTA?!
Lola:::  Oh, I thought you didn't believe in him.
Lisa::: I didn't until I spied him leaving a present behind the couch last night.  Behold!
Lynn:::  There is a present back here. And it's addressed to Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Wow!
Lincoln:::  A Fearsome Flyer 1000?
Lincoln::: Hey, Mr. Grouse. Thanks for the sled.
Mr. Grouse::: Don't thank me. Thank Santa.  Merry Christmas, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Merry Christmas, Mr. Grouse!  Well, another Christmas has come and gone. But this year, I got the best present ever: a new friend. I think from now on, things are gonna be pretty different around here.  Ha ha! Yeah!
Mr. Grouse:::  LOUD!!!
Lincoln:::  Maybe not that different. 
Luan:::  Well, I guess that about wraps things up! YES! I DID IT!  That's twelve! Merry Christmas!  Aah!
Lana:::  WOO-HOO! I FINALLY GOT ONE!
