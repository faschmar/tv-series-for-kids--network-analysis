Note::: Scenes cut off from British re-runs are underlined.
Lucy::: I can't wait to get out of here. 
Leni::: Seriously, who took my sunglasses? 
Lori:::  Hey! Hands off the radio.
Lynn Sr.:::  What have you done to my baby?!
Rita:::  One, two, three, that's four new dents since last weekend.
Lori::: Who let a chicken in the car?!
Lynn Sr.:::  I don't know how many times your mother and I have to say this, but when you're out there on the road Lori, you need to be one hundred percent focused.
Rita:::  Which means the rest of you need to keep quiet and behave. If we find even one more nick on Vanzilla you can say goodbye to your driving privileges indefinitely!
All kids (except Lily):::  We promise.
Lynn Sr.::: Wow! Way to dish out the discipline, hun!
Rita::: Thanks! You know, we have really got this parenting thing down to a science. We're experts!
Lori::: Thanks Flip. 
Flip::: Oh no, thank you.
Lori::: Hey! Who changed the station?!
Luna::: I wanna hear the top three, three!
Leni::: Top forty!
Lucy::: Today's obituaries.
Lisa::: This Michigan Life!
Flip::: Ah! All I see is black! Ow! Someone help!
Doctor::: We're looking at twelve sprains, two minor breaks, and a twist.
Flip::: Hey, I ain't got time for medical speak Doc, I'm sittin' on a van of old Flippees that needs movin'.
Doctor::: You won't be back on your feet for at least a week. Is there someone who can take care of you?
Flip::: Nah, Flip's a lone wolf.  GAH! Cheese and crackers.
Leni::: You guys, this is all our fault. We should take care of Flip.
Lynn::: But how can we do that without Mom and Dad finding out what we did?
Luan::: Yeah, we'll lose Vanzilla privileges forever!
Lucy::: We can hide him in the morgue. A few beds just opened up.
Luan and Lisa:::  Ugh.
Lincoln::: Or we could just hide him in our attic.
Lisa::: Actually, that's not a bad idea. It's quiet, far away from Mom and Dad's room.
Lori::: The attic it is.  Now we just need a safe way to get him there.
Lisa::: Alright, by my calculations, we have 37.23 minutes to get Flip in the attic before our parental units arrive home from work.
Luna::: Red light!
Lincoln:::  Dad! Everyone down!
Luna:::  I know how to distract him.  Hi, I'd like to make a song request.​​​​​
Radio DJ::: Strap in and start clangin', cause we got a special request for the new 27-minute single, from Cowbell and Sebastian.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, this is my favorite song ever.
Lincoln::: Sorry about the rough ride, Flip.
Flip::: Don't worry. Ol' Flip's tough as sandpaper.
Lisa:::  14.34 minutes, almost in the clear.
Lynn:::  Oh, my bad.
Lori::: Oh, Mom,  Did I tell you about Carol's new haircut?!
Rita:::  Oh, uh... No, I don't think you did.
Lori::: She got bangs!  I mean, so brave right?
Flip::: Pretty sure I saw a perfectly good door on the front of the house.
Lana::: Nah, this is way easier.
Flip::: Okay, but all this up and down is rattlin' my innards!
Lori::: Wait! You haven't even seen the pics yet.
Leni::: Hurry, hurry, hurry. Watch out for the door!
Lori::: Here's Carol, with a headband. Ha!
Rita:::  So cute.
Lori::: Oh, there's more.  ...and, um, here's how her bangs look pinned back. So cute right? Right?
Rita::: Okay, sorry. Lily really needs a change, Hon.
Lori::: Oh, um... I'll do it, I've got it.  Never mind, it's all you.
Flip:::  Was the broom closet taken?
Lincoln::: This is the comfiest spot in the house.
Lisa::: And you have access to my collection of antique medical equipment.
Lynn Sr.:::  Who's got a hankering for takeout?!
Flip:::  Eh, I could eat.
Lincoln:::  Woah, woah. You gotta stay off your feet. We'll bring you a plate.
Flip::: Room service? Eh, Flip likes the sound of that, but no broccoli.
Lana::: Well, I'm stuffed.
Lola::: Me too.
Lincoln::: I better get started on my homework!
Luna::: Hey dudes. Can I play that new song for you?
Lori::: I told Bobby I'd call, like, five minutes ago!
Rita::: Oh, hey kids,. What are you doing in the attic?
Lincoln:::  Uh, just playing.
Lana:::  With a snake.
Leni:::  That had snake babies.
Rita:::  Snake? Babies?!
Lisa::: Yes, but fear not, we know you're not a fan of serpents.
Luna::: So, we'll keep them up in the attic until they're ready to be released into the wild.
Luan::: In approximately, uh, six days.
Rita:::  Okay, just as long as I don't have to see them.
Lincoln:::  She bought it. As long as we keep Flip quiet, Mom and Dad will never find out about the accident.
Flip::: Oh, so that's their game.
Flip:::  Boy, this Ace Savvy's something else. Ooh, what a hoot.
Lincoln:::  What are you doing in my room?
Flip::: Ah, that attic setup was hard on Flip's back. Old spine just hasn't felt right since the accident. You know the one you don't want your mom and dad to find out about.
Lori::: Lincoln, Flip gets your room.
Lincoln:::  What?
Lori:::  Flip, we'll do everything we can to keep you comfortable, but you have to be reasonable.
Flip::: Sure, Flip's a simple man who don't need much.
Flip:::  All my Michigan favorites. Corn beef eggrolls, Coney Island dogs and Paczkis.  Wait, didn't I ask for a papaya juice? Freshly squeezed?  Hey, Spooky, my big toe's been itching something fierce. How 'bout a little scratch?
Lucy::: Uh, Fangs, you wanna take this?
Flip::: Eh, I don't know how to use these Mini TVs. How 'bout some live entertainment?
Luna::: Great, I'll grab my guitar.
Flip::: Well, hold up Hippie. I had a little time to workshop some sketch during the last bedding change.
Lincoln:::  I hope everyone saved room for dessert.  Woah.  Oopsie, doopsie.
Flip:::  Gold, haha, now let's do the next scene.
Flip::: A little late-night TV shoppin' keeps the mind off the pain.
Lincoln:::  We're all going to get busted.
Flip::: That sounds like a you problem.
Lynn Sr::: What's all the racket? Everyone's supposed to be in bed.
Lola::: Oh, hi Daddy! We just...
Leni::: Didn't wanna miss the chance to get a deal on a new barbecue brush.
Lynn Sr.::: What was that in the kitchen?
Luan:::  Uh, maybe it's Lily?
Lynn Sr.:::  She better keep her cute little paws off my leftover ribs.
Lincoln::: Uh, ribs are still safe, here you go.
Lynn Sr.::: Uh, actually, I better not. Told your mom I'd cut down on the old midnight snacks.
Lana::: All clear.
Lynn Sr.::: Hey. Who's hogging the bathroom? I have to get to work.
Lincoln::: Um, I think it's Lynn.
Lori::: Yup.  Definitely Lynn.
Lincoln::: Lynn! Uh, we thought you were in... the bathroom...
Lynn:::  Oh, um, no, I saw Luan go in there.
Luan:::  Go in where?  I mean, uh, I think the, uh, twins are taking a bath.
Lana:::  Ew, bath? I never take baths...  I mean, uh, Leni's in there.
Leni::: Oh, hey you guys.  What are you waving about?
Lynn Sr.:::  Hey if you kids don't tell me who's in that bathroom, I am going to-
Flip::: Eh, you'd better tell your mom she's all out of that fancy body lotion.
Lynn Sr.::: Flip?!
Rita:::  Flip?!  Is that my lotion?!
Lynn Sr::: Is that my robe? What's going on here?!
Lori::: We had an accident with Vanzilla and Flip got hurt.
Leni::: And since it was our fault, we've all been taking care of him.
Lincoln::: But we knew if you found out we'd lose our driving privileges. So we had to hide him in the attic.
Lynn Sr::: Getting into another accident is one thing, but lying to us is a whole other level!
Rita::: Your driving privileges are suspended indefinitely!
Kids:::  We're sorry.
Flip::: Ah, go easy on the kids. They took good care of me. Don't let this gruff exterior fool ya, on the inside Flip's just a delicate flower that needs tending to.
Rita::: Well, I guess indefinitely was a little harsh. Let's say, no driving for the rest of the month.
Flip::: And when you get the van back, come by the Food 'N' Fuel for free Flippees.
Kids:::  Yeah!
Flip:::  But no refills!  Now who's taking me back to the Doc to lose this cast?
Flip:::  Eh, thanks for the ride.
Lynn Sr.::: This is the new Cowbell and Sebastian song I was talking about.
Flip::: Ow! Someone help!
Lynn Sr.:::  On the bright side, maybe we'll get free Flippees at the end of the week. 
Flip:::  Stick to the dang script, Lynn!
