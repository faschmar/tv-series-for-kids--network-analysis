Lincoln:::  Ahh, nothing like reading comics on a peaceful summer--
Luan::: Whoa! A little help? 
Lincoln:::  Back from another birthday party?
Luan:::  Uh, my third gig this weekend. I could really use an assistant. Hey, what about you? You're great with Gary.
Lincoln::: Hey, stop that! I thought Lucy was helping you.
Luan::: And now, if my assistant will just hand me one more balloon, we'll have a pterodactyl.
Boy:::  You killed the dinosaur!
Luan:::​  Lucy didn't work out. Neither did Lynn.
Luan::: ​Water you say we add some melon?
Luan::: ​Or Leni.
Luan::: ​Why are clowns never bored? ‘Cause we're good at keeping occu-​pied​.  ​I said, good at keeping occu-pied​.
Luan::: ​​Or Lisa.
Luan::: ​Hey, Birthday Boy. Why don't you take the seat of honor?
Lisa:::  ​No, no! No one eat that cake! It clearly causes gastrointestinal distress.
​Lincoln:::  Well, I am so honored to be your fifth choice.
Luan:::  ​Come on, Lincoln. Please? I really need your help.
​Lincoln:::​ I don't know. I´m not really the performing type. I don't want to make a fool of myself on stage.
​Luan::: ​Don't worry. That's my job. All you have to do is help with the props.
​Lincoln:::​ Uh, I don't know think it's for-  What's that?
​Luan::: Ah, just birthday cake. I always get sent home with leftovers.
​Lincoln:::​ Oh... 
​Luan:::​ Usually I share it with my assistant. But since this job isn't for you--
​Lincoln:::​  When did I say that?
Luan:::​ Why are clowns never bored? 'Cause we're good at keeping occu-​pied​.
​Lincoln:::​ Sorry!
​Lincoln:::​ That was awesome. The part when I tripped and then the audience laughed, and then clapped? Amazing!
Luan:::  ​Glad you enjoyed it. Now here, I need you to clean this. Gary pooped in it.
Luan:::​ ​Water​ you say we add some melon?
​Lincoln:::​  Whoa, nelly! 
​Lincoln::: ​Man, great crowd, huh?
Luan:::​ Yeah, super. So, what was that all about with the watermelon?
Lincoln:::​ Well, you know, audiences seem to love it when I fall down so--
​Luan::: ​Let me worry about the audience. You take care of deodorizing these clown shoes.
​Lincoln:::​ Whoopsy-daisy! 
Lincoln:::  ​See? I do know what audiences like.
​Luan::: ​And now, if my assistant will hand me one more balloon, we'll have a pterodactyl.
​Lincoln:::​  I went a little overboard with the helium. Whoa, good gravy! 
Luan::: ​What did one plate say to the other? ​Lunch' is on me.
Lincoln:::  ​Gadzooks! 
Lincoln::: I guess lunch is on me.
Bratty Kid's Mom::: ​ He is hilarious!
Fat Mom::: ​I know. LOL. I just learned what that means.
​Luan:::​ All right, Birthday boy. Why don't you take the seat of honor?
Lincoln::: ​Holy macaroni! 
Lincoln:::​ Boy, we are killing it. But I've been thinking, maybe you should do a little less of the talky stuff and more of the pratfalls. 
Luan:::​ Are you kidding me?!
​Lincoln:::​ What?
​Luan:::​ Look, Lincoln. Just because you got a few laughs does not make you an expert on clowning. There's a lot more to it than just falling on your butt.
​Lincoln:::​ Well, the audience sure seems to like my--
Luan:::​ Lincoln, enough! No more pratfalls. I am the clown. You are the assistant. Now go refill these whoopee cushions.
Lincoln:::​ But they're already inflated.
Luan:::​  Not anymore!
Lincoln:::​ Oh, yeah?! Well, that would've been funnier if you'd fallen on your butt!
Lincoln:::​ How dare she speak to me like that!  After everything I've done for this business?  You'd think she'd have a little more--
​Lincoln:::​  Funny Business, Inc. Your fun is our business. Lincoln speaking.
Woman on the phone::: 
Lincoln:::​ Yes, we're available the 11th.
​Woman on the phone:::​ 
​Lincoln:::​ What?
Woman on the phone:::​ 
Lincoln:::​ Oh, really?
​Woman on the phone:::​ 
Lincoln:::​ Great. See you the 11th.
​Luan:::​ Who did we just book?
​Lincoln:::​ Actually, the correct question would be, who did I just book?
​Lisa::: ​ You're both wrong! It's 'whom'! 
Lincoln:::​ They only wanted me.
​Luan:::​ Yeah, right.
Lincoln:::​ It's true. You may not recognize my talent, but apparently the birthday party community does.
​Luan:::​ So, what are you gonna do for your act? Fall on your butt for an hour?
Lincoln:::​ That's exactly what I'm going to do, 'cause the audiences love it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go put on my padded underwear.
​Lincoln:::​ So, how old is the birthday girl? Four? Five?
Maggie's Mom:::​ Thirteen.
​Lincoln:::​ Oh. A little older than usual crowd, but no problem. My comedy is ageless.
Lincoln::: Hey, guys! Who's ready to laugh?  Whoopsie doodle! Now who put this here?
Maggie::: Um, you did, obviously.
Lincoln:::  Maybe these glasses will help me see better!  Eye-a-watha!  I really gotta get my prescription checked.
Maggie::: Mom, look what that loser clown did to my poster.
Lincoln::: Oh, look at that! I have a message, too! Mom, didn't I tell you not to text me at...  Whoa!  Remember, guys. Never walk and text!
Tween #1::: Ugh, now he's gonna lecture us?
Maggie:::  He ruined my cake! Mom, why did you hire him? I swear, if I had a door around me, I would slam it so hard right now!
Lincoln::: Um, excuse me, everyone. There will now be a brief, unscheduled intermission. Text amongst yourselves!
Maggie's Mom::: Where are you going? I paid you to perform for an hour.
Lincoln::: But I'm doing my best material, and they hate me.
Maggie's Mom::: Well, try something else. You're a professional clown, aren't you?
Maggie's Dad::: Remind me not to book Funny Business, Inc. for my kid's birthday.
Fat Mom::: Me neither.
Bratty Kid's Mom::: Oh, me neither. I don't want my kid to hate me.
Lincoln::: Sorry, gotta run to the little clown's room.
Luan::: Funny Business, Inc. Your fun is our business!
Lincoln::: Luan!
Luan:::  I'm sorry, I can't hear you. My clown car's going through a tunnel.
Lincoln::: Luan, it's me.
Luan::: I know. That's why I hung up.
Luan::: This is a business line, Lincoln! What do you want?
Lincoln::: Luan, I'm bombing out here. You gotta help me, please!
Luan:::  Oh! How could I possibly help you? You're the clowning expert.
Lincoln::: No, I'm not. You are. You told me there's a lot more to clowning than just falling on your butt, and you were right. Will you please come help me?
Luan::: I don't know, Lincoln. Maybe bombing would be a good learning experience for you.
Lincoln::: Well, there's one other thing. I think I'm ruining the reputation of Funny Business, Inc. These parents are brutal!
Luan::: Don't move! I'll be right there.  Ugh, Gary!
Lincoln::: Luan! Wait, how did you know I was in here?
Luan:::  Well, this was a pretty good clue.
Lincoln::: Oh! So, what's the plan?
Luan::: Okay, let's see what we've got here. Hmm, Emo tweens. Notoriously tough crowd. But, don't worry, this isn't my first mope fest.
Maggie::: Oh, I get it. She's, like, trapped in a box. That's exactly how I felt when my mom said I couldn't dye my hair purple.
Tween #1::: Wow. It's like the soul crushing pointlessness of seventh grade.
Luan::: You ready to do this?
Lincoln:::  I don't know.
Luan::: You'll be fine. Just follow my lead.
Maggie::: Wow! It's about how we're all just, like, clones.
Tween #2::: That's what I was gonna say.
Maggie::: Exactly.
Maggie's Dad::: I have to get their business card.
Bratty Kid's Mom::: Well, I call the weekend of the 22nd.
Lincoln::: Thanks for saving my butt. You were amazing out there. And I'm sorry for the way I was acting.
Luan::: It's okay. I remember how great it was to get my first big laugh. I shouldn't have been so harsh. Still my assistant?
Lincoln::: Still your assistant. Let me get those for you.  Whoa!
Luan:::  You know, that actually was kind of funny. Here, let me help...  Whoa, good gravy!  Hiawatha!
