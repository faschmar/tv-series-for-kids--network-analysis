Sid::: “The roof looks amazing Ronnie Anne, I love the camping theme.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Thanks, Sid, I'm kinda nervous, it's the first time I'm hosting a big slumber party.”
Sid::: “Just think of it like a s'more.”  “You're great at sleeping and you're great at parties, mash them together and you get…”  “Greatest slumber party ever.”
Ronnie Anne::: “The perfect combo, just like us.”  “You guys finished setting up your tents yet?”
Laird:::  “Not exactly.”
Nikki:::  “Define finished.”
Casey:::  “Define tent.”
Sameer:::  “Nailed it.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Ooh, Sancho's here with the pizza.”
Carl::: “Who ordered thin crust?
Adelaide::: “Got any with pineapples?”
Carl:::  “So, uh, where do we set up our tents?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Uh, Carl, Adelaide, can I speak to you over here?”  “Sorry guys, the slumber party's just for me and my friends, we're doing big kid stuff.”
Laird::: “Fifteen feet.”
Carl::: “Amateurs, I could beat that in my sleep.”
Adelaide::: “Yeah, watch.”
Sid:::  “Sorry Adelaide, big kids only.”
Ronnie Anne::: Maybe next time?”
Carl::: “Or… this time.”  “ABUELA!!! RONNIE ANNE WON'T LET US CAMP ON THE ROOF WITH HER!!!”
Rosa::: “Ronalda!”  “You must always include others, especially tu familia.”  “Let them stay for a little while, at least until they go to bed.”
Ronnie Anne:::  “Fine.”  “You can join the party.”
Sid::: “Don't worry Ronnie Anne, sometimes s'mores have extra ingredients. Like pizza.”
Ronnie Anne::: “I do love pizza.”
Sameer::: “It was a dark and stormy night... ”  “..and the butler was nowhere to be found.”
Carl::: “Oh! Oh! This is the one where he's buried in the wall.”
Adelaide::: “And tries to eat his way out.”
Carl & Adelaide::: “Cause he's a zombie.”
Laird::: “A zombie!”
Sameer::: “It's cool, I have a scarier story.”  “The Tale of the Cursed Highway. It was a darker stormier night...”
Carl:::  “And the hitch-hiker has a hook for a hand.”
Adelaide::: “Next.”
Laird::: “Sharp appendages.”
Sameer::: “Okay, those are the only two I memorized. I'm just gonna wing it here.”  “Ooh, I got one.”  ”The Tale of the-”
Carl::: “Ghost spiders!”
Adelaide::: “Next!
Laird:::  “Is the scary part over?”
Sameer:::  “I can't work like this, we're out.”
Sid:::  “Don't worry, I've got this, they can't ruin a dance party.”
Adelaide:::  And now for the Frog Lake ballet.
Sid::: “Adelaide. it's K-pop time.”
Carl::: “No, it's Carl time, DJ Carl!  I made this track myself, It's Called Abuelo's Farts The Remix!”

Adelaide::: Ballet!
Carl::: Farts!
Adelaide::: Ballet!
Carl::: Farts!
Nikki::: “New game, who dares to drink my mystery juice?”
Carl:::  “You guys are wimps, give me that.” 
Laird:::  “Is this dill? I hate dill.”
Sid::: “Okay, it's bad, they've got to go.”
Ronnie Anne::: “We can't kick them out, they'll go to Abuela. We need to keep them busy and out of our way.”  “Oh, I've got it.”  “Hey guys, time for a scavenger hunt, whoever collects all the items on the list wins a super s'more.”
Carl & Adelaide:::  “A super s'more?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Carl and Adelaide, you can be on one team.”
Adelaide::: “Let's get a head start.”
Carl::: “Suckers!”
Sameer::: “Hurry Ronnie Anne! What are the other teams?”
Ronnie Anne::: “There are no other teams. Now we can have some real fun.”
Casey:::  “Ooh, gotcha.”
Sameer:::  “Good thinking.”
Laird:::  “Oh, but I love scavenger hunts.”  “Yup, it was dill.”
Mr. Nakamura::: “You need to borrow my favorite sweater-vest for a scavenger hunt? Happy to help, be right back.” 
Carl::: “We'll be feasting on that super s'more in no time.”
Adelaide::: “Fastest scavenger hunt ever.”
Mr. Nakamura::: “Here we go. Now, which one is my favorite?”  “I'll have to try them all on.”
Laird::: “The Cosmos Five-thousand is so powerful, that you can see Saturn's rings.”
Casey:::  “And Bobby.”
Sid:::  “I knew this would be a great slumber party.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Oh, we're just getting started.”
Carl::: “Now we have to get… Abuelo's longest nose hair? Ah! Gross!”
Adelaide:::  “It'll be worth it.”
Sid::: “Right-hand apple.”  “Left elbow grape.”  “Right toe on orange.”
Adelaide::: “Sergio's crackers, got it.”
Sergio:::  “Snack thieves!”  “Get back here!”
Casey::: “Hey! Watch it!”
Ronnie Anne::: “Okay Laird! Here it comes!”
Ronnie Anne:::  “That's a nine.”
Nikki::: “Sweet!”
Ronnie Anne:::  “That's an eight.”
Laird::: “Yeah!”
Ronnie Anne:::  “Casey, where's your cupcake?”  “Cupcake fight!”
Sid::: Best slumber party ever!
Carl::: “And the last on the list... A mango that looks like Vito?”
Adelaide::: “Where are the mangoes?”
Carl::: “Hey, there's Par, maybe he has some in his truck.”
Nikki::: “The roasted jalapeño is definitely my fave.”
Sameer::: “I didn't even know you could make salsa from pineapples.”
Sid::: “They're all my favorite.”
Casey::: “Ooh, I could eat this forever.”
Rosa:::  “Carl! Adelaide! Time to get ready for bed!”
Ronnie Anne:::  “Oh, uh, they're just… trying out different salsas, they'll be down in a minute.”
Rosa::: “What a good prima.”
Ronnie Anne::: “That's what family's for.”  “Okay, I better go get Carl and Adelaide.”
Laird:::  “Isn't that them?”  “Huh, looks like they're getting into Par's delivery truck.”
Ronnie Anne:::  “What?!”  “We have to stop him.”
Sid::: “But, what if your abuela comes back?”
Sameer::: “Don't worry, you guys go, I'll stay here and stall her.”
Casey:::  “One for the road.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Ugh! We just missed him.”
Nikki::: “Do you know where he's headed?”
Ronnie Anne::: “No, but Bobby does.”  “Bobby, where's Par's next stop?”
Bobby::: “Par-dawg? He usually takes the old fruit to the city dump.”
Ronnie Anne::: “The city dump?”
Rosa::: “Carl, Adelaide.”
Sameer:::  “Five more minutes, Abuela.”  “Please?”
Rosa::: “Okay, since you're having so much fun.”
Sameer::: “Whew! We did it, guys.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Carl!”
Sid::: “Adelaide!”  “They're not here!”
Casey::: “They could be anywhere.”
Ronnie Anne::: “We never should have sent them on the scavenger hunt.”
Laird:::  “Hey, it's not a total loss. At least I found my old friend Mr. Scruffles.”  “Ah! You've changed.”  “But I still love you.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Abuela, I need your help. I messed up and now Carl and Adelaide are lost in the city.”
Rosa::: “Que? But they're right here.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Carl!”
Sid::: “Adelaide!”
Carl::: “You guys smell like garbage.”
Ronnie Anne::: “How did you get back? We thought Par drove off with you.”
Adelaide::: “Nope, he just gave us a mango.” 
Carl::: “Check it out.”  “Hey, I'm Vito. How's you's doin'?”
Ronnie Anne:::  “That does look like Vito.”
Adelaide:::  “That's everything on the list.”  “Where's our giant s'more?”
Ronnie Anne::: “Sorry guys, I made up the scavenger hunt to get rid of you.”
Carl::: “Get rid of us? But we were the best part of your lame sleepover.”
Adelaide::: “Well, we did ruin the scary stories, and the dance party, and…”
Carl::: “Okay, okay, maybe we weren't the best part.”
Ronnie Anne::: “Abuela, I know it's late, but can they come back to the party? I owe them a giant s'more.”
Rosa::: “Si, Ronalda, but just for a little longer.”
Hector:::  “Ah! Vito! What happened!? Speak to me!”
Ronnie Anne::: “Alright, one super s'more as promised.”
Sid::: “Best slumber party ever!”
Bobby:::  “You can say that again.”
