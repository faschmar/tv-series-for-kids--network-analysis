Nikki::: Check it out! I finally pulled it off. Corndog tower.
Casey::: Totally epic!
Ronnie Anne::: That is awesome.
Laird:::  I hope this is relish.
Casey::: You think that's epic? One time I got these new sneakers that let me dunk on a ten-foot rim.
Flashback Casey:::  Yeah!
Sameer::: Bro.
Nikki::: Epic indeed.
Laird::: Impressive.
Sid::: Well one time, I stayed awake for three days straight. I looked like a zombie.
Sameer::: Wow.
Ronnie Anne::: Pssh. My turn. Last month I stopped a purse thief on the subway.
Flashback Ronnie Anne::: Stop right there!
Dona::: Oh my goodness! Thank you so much!
Ronnie Anne::: No problem.
Sid::: Mind blown!
Laird::: Incredible. Almost as cool as the time I wrestled a shark.
Sameer::: You even fist bumped after?
Laird::: Yeah, I don't hold grudges. What about you, Sameer?
Sameer::: Oh, uh… me?  Oh, got one. This morning.  The cafeteria ran out of milk.  And all I had was water.  So I poured it on my cereal.  And I ate it.  Pretty epic, huh?
Ronnie Anne:::  Uh… Yeah. Totally.
Casey::: Love to hear more, but it's time for class.
Sameer::: A lame cereal story? Good going Sameer.  I gotta up my game.  Epic things to do.  Go to the moon… Cure a disease… Break a record? I could try that.  I'm gonna break a record!
Becky:::  Did you just say you're trying to break a record?
Sameer::: Yeah, all my friends have done something epic except for me. But if I can beat some cool record, I have an awesome story to tell.
Becky::: Lucky for you I know all about breaking records. I mean, I do hold the record for most kids stuffed in a locker.
Kid in Locker::: Can I come out now?
Becky::: No. Hand me that big green book.
Kid in Locker::: Yes, ma'am.
Sameer:::  Great Lakes City's Big Book of Epic Records.
Becky::: If you're gonna break a record, you're gonna need my guidance.
Sameer::: I'm in. Let's do it.
Kid in Locker::: Good luck, Sameer.
Becky::: We're gonna start with a fun one. Being hit by the most dodgeballs in ten seconds.
Sameer:::  Sounds more like a painful one.
Becky::: Pssh, only for you.  Ready, aim… Pummel!  Didn't beat the record! Wanna go again or try something else?
Sameer:::  Try something else.
Becky::: Go again? Cool! Pummel!
Sameer::: What's this record?
Becky::: It's easy, you just have to stay in the box for an hour.  With a thousand fire ants.
Sameer::: Wait, what?  They burn!
Becky::: Well they're not called cuddle ants.
Sameer::: They're in my underwear!
Becky::: Most instruments played at the same time!  Aw, we forgot the ukelele.
Becky::: Longest time hanging upside down while being tickled.
Sameer:::  I'm laughing but I hate this.  What did I fall in?
Becky::: Oof. You don't wanna know.
Sameer::: Ow!
Becky::: Most clothespins on a human body.  Only a hundred seventy-four more to go.
Sameer:::  No more!  These records are way too extreme!  Maybe I'm not meant to break a record. I'm just not good at this stuff.
Becky::: Well what are you good at?
Sameer::: I don't know. Blowing bubbles, skateboarding.
Becky:::  Hmm… How about both at the same time?
Sameer::: Huh?
Becky::: Check this out. Wheels McBubbly lives up to his name when he skateboarded while blowing a bubble for three hours, twenty-six minutes and twenty-three seconds.
Sameer::: That one's perfect for me.  Wheels McBubbly…  I'm coming for your record.
Ronnie Anne::: This is so cool, Sameer. I never even knew you were into breaking records.
Sameer::: I have many layers, Ronnie Anne.
Casey::: You're totally gonna do it.
Laird::: Yeah.
Nikki::: You got this.
Sid::: I'm gonna make a confetti cannon for when you break the record.
Becky:::  Ugh! You guys are breaking the record for giving me the biggest headache! Let's start this! Ready…  Set…  Blow!
Principal Valenzuela::: Woah!
Sameer::: Sorry, it's hard to see with the bubble in my face.
Principal Valenzuela::: Hey! There's no chewing gum or skateboarding allowed in here.
Ronnie Anne::: But, Principal Valenzuela, he's going for the Great Lakes City record.
Principal Valenzuela:::  You mean Wheels McBubbly's record? I'll let it slide just this one time. Go Sameer. Ha. You got this.
Sameer::: Thanks.  How long do I have to go?
Becky::: Three hours, twenty-five minutes.
Sameer::: Piece of cake.
Mr. Suarez::: So who would like to take a crack at this equation.  You're correct, this equation is unsolvable.
Mrs. Kernicky::: Instead of running laps today, I thought we could try fencing.
Sameer:::  Uh-oh.  Becky! What are you doing?
Becky:::  Oh, uh… Right.  Back scoundrels! This bubble shall not be poppethed!
Sameer::: Aw man, how do I eat lunch? I hadn't thought this part through.
Sid:::  I got you, Sameer.  Let's see… pickles, tuna sandwich, hummus, OJ.  Voila! Lunch smoothie.
Sameer:::  Thanks, Sid.  Ugh, gross.
Becky::: You're doing great, Sameer!
Sameer::: Thanks, there's just one problem. I have to pee.
Becky::: Yikes. Uh… Can't you hold it in for…  forty-five more minutes?
Sameer::: I've been holding it in for three hours already.  You've got this, Sameer, you've always had good aim.  Guess my aim isn't that good afterall.
Nikki::: Pretty rad that Ms. Galiano let us have class outside today.
Sameer::: Yeah, sure makes it easier to skate with this bubble.
Nikki::: Woah. Gnarly moves, Bubble-Boy.
Principal Valenzuela::: Sameer's gonna break the record, in my school.  This is so exciting.
Becky::: Just ten more seconds.
Ronnie Anne::: You've got this, Sameer.
Sid::: I'm ready with the confetti cannon.
Becky::: Five… Four…
Everyone::: Three… Two…
Sid::: Oops.
Sameer:::  No! I had it.
Becky:::  Super sad, dude. But also kind of funny if you think about it.
Ronnie Anne::: Are you okay, Sameer?
Sameer::: No, I really wanted to beat a record.
Ronnie Anne::: Okay, but why?
Sameer::: You all have amazing stories to tell, and I have nothing. I wanted to finally do something as epic as you guys.
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, uh… Yeah… About that epic story of mine… I should probably fess up that it wasn't as epic as I said it was.
Sameer::: Please, you caught a purse thief.
Ronnie Anne::: Well, not exactly.
Dona:::  Hey! I needed my grandson to run my purse to the repair shop before it closed. Thanks for nothin'!
Flashback Ronnie Anne::: Oopsie.
Sid::: My story was exaggerated too. I didn't stay up for three days straight, but I had a dream that I did.
Casey::: My story about dunking on a ten foot rim went a little differently too.
Kid::: Boo!
Laird::: Well, my wrestling a shark story was a hundred percent true. 
Casey::: Oh come on!
Ronnie Anne::: No it wasn't.
Sid:::  Sure, it was.
Laird::: It was!  I... I have a picture.
Sameer:::  Right. So, all your stories were made up?
Ronnie Anne:::  More like, exaggerated. But, yeah.
Sameer::: So I'm not lame for not having an epic story?
Ronnie Anne::: No way.
Sid::: You're the coolest.
Laird:::  Okay look, I even have a video.
Becky:::  Out of my way, Laird!  Huge news! I called the GLC Record Association and told them about all your failures!
Sameer:::  Uh… thanks?
Becky::: No! You don't understand! You just broke a record for the most failed attempts at breaking records!
Sameer::: Really?
Ronnie Anne:::  You're officially a record holder!
Casey::: So epic!
Sid::: You're famous!
Nikki::: Awesome!
Kid in Locker:::  Woohoo! You did it!
Becky:::  Wanna try the one with fire ants again?  Then you'd hold two records.
Sameer::: Nooo!
