Clyde::: Good afternoon, Listen Out Loud fans. It's me, Clyde McBride. And I'm outside of Royal Wood's famed restaurant, Lynn's Table. Today I'm giving you an inside look at the ins and outs of running a restaurant. Between you and me and my dream journal, I hope to be the owner of my own place one day. So, I thought...   Ugh, Dad! Bleh!
Howard::: Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. Just wanted to apply a quick coat of sunblock, SPF seven-hundred.
Clyde::: But Dad, I'm about to go inside!
Howard::: Are there windows?
Clyde::: Yes.
Howard::: Then the rays of that fiery orb can still get to you. But I'll tell you what. I won't make you wear the sun hat.
Clyde::: So today I'll be learning, ugh... how to run a restaurant.
Howard::: And done. Oh, I have to take a picture for Har-bear, our little restaurateur. Say Gouda.  It's just a cheese.
Clyde::: Cheese.
Howard::: Ok, I'll come pick you up after your podcast. Just in time to re-apply more sunblock. Well, your old dad is off to rehearsal. Better warm up. Mmm may, may, may, may, may.
Clyde::: Now, where was I? Oh, yeah. So today I'll be learning all about the restaurant business from drum roll, please… Mr. Lynn Loud, owner and chef of Lynn's Table and… father of my best friend in the whole world! And you listeners will be coming along for the ride. Let's go inside.
Kotaro::: Yeah. Oh, hey, Clyde. Coming through with hot wings!
Clyde::: Oh, hey Kotaro, nice rollerskates.
Kotaro::: Oh, these are not just roller skates. They are service industry game-changers. Front and rear top stops and they even play the Lynn's Table Jingle.
Clyde::: Whoa! Listeners, I know the day just started, but boy, we are off to a strong start! Uh, do you know where Mr. Loud is?
Lynn Sr.:::  Whoa, whoa, whoa! ! I'm okay!
Clyde::: Ah, never mind. I hear him in the kitchen! See you later Kotaro!
Kotaro::: Oh, hey. Mind giving me a push?
Lynn Sr.::: Cooking up a bunch of yum. Yum, yum.
Clyde::: Hey, Mr. Loud.
Lynn Sr.::: Ow, my thumb! Oh, hey, Clyde. You're just in time. Grab an apron. The lunch rush is about to start. Oh, and a hair net.
Clyde::: Oh, it sounds like we're in for a treat. Chef Loud is letting us watch him work.
Lynn Sr.::: Watch? I need you as my sous chef today. My number two.  Number two.
Clyde::: Oh, really? Listeners, I wish you could see the look on my face right now.
Lynn Sr.::: Well, sure. How else is a future restaurant owner going to learn? Here, help me get started making the special of the day Pump-Lynn pie. But first, let's wash those hands. Oh! Hot! Hot, hot, hot! Oh, oh, that's better. Clyde, you're up.
Clyde::: Ooh, this is soap so fragrant.
Lynn Sr.::: That's olive oil.
Clyde::: Ah.
Lynn Sr.::: Okay. Could you grab me some of those mixing bowls?
Clyde::: You got it! Dah! Whoa, hands are a little slippery. Ah! Got one!
Lynn Sr.::: Hey, thanks for pre-greasing it for me, Clyde.
Clyde::: So, Mr. Loud, while you're prepping that pumpkin, we have some questions from our listeners. Gina from Hazeltucky wants to know what's the secret to a perfect dish?
Lynn Sr.::: Ooh, whoa, That's a… that's a toughie. I'll have to think about my answer after I o…pen up a can of pumpkin puree. Clyde's my sous chef for the day. You got your spices, your nutmeg.
Clyde::: Wait. What's that?
Lynn Sr.::: My famous pumpkin spice blend?
Clyde::: No, that song you were just singing.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, my autumnal pumpkin pie ditty! I was just making it up.
Clyde::: You're a chef and a songwriter? Listener's mind blown!
Lynn Sr.::: Huh? I guess I don't even notice that I'm doing it anymore. I find it's the perfect way to cook. I did…  That's it, Clyde! The diddies are my secret to making the perfect dish! There's your answer, Gina, from Hazeltucky. Here, Clyde, why don't you try some mixing and ditty-ing of your own? Your ingredients are flour, baking powder, and a dash of flare! Let's see what you got!
Clyde::: Uh… mixing up dough and spreading it over the counter! Uh oh! I think I used too much baking powder!  Note... next time, less baking powder, more flare.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, don't worry about. It took me years to perfect the art of the cooking ditty. And a fire extinguisher or two.
Clyde::: Oh! We keep two in every room.
Lynn Sr.::: Here's a little secret, Clyde. I happened to prepare a couple of pies before you got here, just in case. Let's put those in the oven.
Clyde::: Good thinking, Mr. Loud.
Lynn Sr.::: If there's one thing I've learned in this business, Clyde, it's… always make extra pies. And use your leftovers in the soup of the day. And the customer's always right. And don't read reviews.
Clyde::: Did you catch all that? Listeners? We're mining culinary gold!
Kotaro::: Attention Chefs! The lunch rush is here, and it's much worse than we expected. It's the weekend of the Rattlesnake Roundup. We've got folks all the way from the Poconos out there!
Clyde::: Let's go check it out! Looks like the whole town's out there! And they look hungry.
Lynn Sr.::: The people or the snakes?
Clyde::: Both! Where's my paper bag?
Lynn Sr.::: Clyde, it's all going to b… can I borrow that bag?
Scoots::: Hey you three! I brought a big ol' sea bass for the Bring Your Own Fish special. I'll put it in the kitchen for ya.
Lynn Sr.::: Scoots. We've talked about this. We do not have a Bring Your Own Fish special and the kitchen is off-limits. Scoots is one of our more demanding customers. It takes a certain, neh, strength to handle her. I'll rock paper you for Scoots duty, K-Dog.
Kotaro::: Dang it! Lost again. Scoots, Ma'am, let's bring you back to your table and I'll get a bucket for your fish.
Lynn Sr.::: There he goes. He's a brave man, and terrible at rock, paper scissors. He always starts with scissors. Alright, Clyde, it's time to do some table service.
Clyde::: Listeners, we're about to shadow as Chef Loud works some of his customer service magic.
Lynn Sr.::: Hey there, Mr. Grouse. What can I get you? Might I suggest our special, Pump-Lynn pie?
Mr. Grouse::: What happened to the rollerskating waiter guy? The one I actually like.
Lynn Sr.::: Yeah, well, you know, lucky for you, you got me today.
Mr. Grouse::: Lucky's not the term I'd use. I'll just have the prune soup, but not too hot! Or too soupy!  Or too pruny!
Lynn Sr.::: I would love to bring you that if it was on our menu.
Mr. Grouse::: Yeah, I know. You got a lousy menu and the font's too dang small.
Lynn Sr.::: Alright. Well, we'll see what we can do.
Mr. Grouse::: And I'll take one of your pun pies too!
Lynn Sr.::: Coming right up.
Flip::: Aye! Garcon! I got an issue over here... with my soup!
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, boy! Come on, Clyde.
Flip::: I need a refund. I found a scorpion in my bowl.
Clyde::: But you ate it all.
Flip::: It was at the bottom!
Lynn Sr.::: You know what? Fine Flip. I'll get you a refund. But this is the last time!
Flip::: I want my money in unmarked dimes!
Clyde::: Ten cents. Twenty cents. Thirty cents.
Flip::: Just give me the sack, Kid!
Kotaro::: Look out, Flip! Hot prune soup comin' through!
Mr. Grouse::: There's my soup.
Flip::: Why is there a scorpion here?
Lynn Sr.::: Hang on. I'll get some towels! Clyde, call an ambulance!
Clyde::: Listeners, BRB. Restaurant emergency!  And we're back here in the kitchen. Turns out we didn't need the ambulance. Just a round of ice packs and some anti-venom. Which my dads always make me carry. As for the Scorpion, we sent it to an insect reserve.
Lynn Sr.::: See, Clyde? That's why a good restaurateur knows how to juggle anything that comes at you. Now, let's check on those pies. Mmm. Still looking and smelling good. Just a few more minutes.
Clyde::: So we prepped the dessert special, took lunch orders... now what?
Lynn Sr.::: Time to get cooking.
Clyde::: Listeners, you can't see this, but I've got goose bumps.
Lynn Sr.::: Okay. Table twelve wants the Lynn-sagna and the Lynn-ger chicken. Table eight wants to Lynn-Guine and chicken Dump-lynns. And Grouse still needs his prune soup, which we don't make. So, I'll need a tray for the Lynn-sagna. A frying pan for the Dump-lynns, a strainer for the Lynn-guine and I guess I'm making prune soup. Let's start chopping.
Scoots::: Make way! Scoots' comin' through!
Lynn Sr.::: Uh. Can I help you, Scoots?
Scoots::: Oh, chill out. I'm just browsing the fridge. I know you keep the good stuff back here.
Lynn Sr.::: Come on, Scoots! The same condiments we have on the table are the same ones in the kitchen.
Scoots::: Ooh, I'll find your hot mustard one day!
Lynn Sr.::: Order's up! Alright, Sous Chef Clyde, let's bring these meals to some hungry customers.  And here's your… prune soup.
Mr. Grouse::: This looks semi edible, Loud. Now quit hovering. You're getting your stank on it.
Lynn Sr.:::  Fresh ground pepper? Bon Appetite! Aww, you're looking good today!
Clyde::: Here's your Lynn-sagna with fresh parmesan.
Lynn Sr.::: I see you got your favorite table. We saved it for you.
Clyde::: And Lynn-ger chicken with extra Lynn-ger.
Lynn Sr.::: And that's the last one. Let's head back to the kitchen.
Both::: Phew!
Clyde::: So Mr. Loud, our listeners and myself have one final question for you. What is the most important thing about being a restaurant owner?
Lynn Sr.::: Well, first of all, I am floored by your hard-hitting questions again, Clyde. I think the most important thing is to really pay attention to the details.
Clyde::: Mr. Loud.
Lynn Sr.::: Every little thing...
Clyde::: Mr. Loud!
Lynn Sr.::: While also being able to put out fires.
Clyde::: Mr. Loud!
Lynn Sr.::: What?
Clyde::: There's a fire!
Lynn Sr.::: Ah! Oh no! My Pump-Lynn pies! Where's my fire extinguisher?!  Oh, ding, dang, darn it, Lynn! You burned the special. Uh! I better bust out my frozen pound cake.
Clyde::: Actually, Mr. Loud, my dad's and I have a quick dessert recipe for any occasion. I'll just need a mixing bowl, spoon bananas, cream and wafer cookies!
Lynn Sr.::: Yes, sir. You got it, Chef Clyde!
Clyde::: Mixing up bananas in the bowl of cream. With hungry customers, we can't lose steam.
Lynn Sr.::: Clyde! Clyde, you're doing it! You're ditty-ing and mixing.
Clyde:::  I am! I am!
Lynn Sr.::: I told you, you were a natural! Ah, keep going!
Clyde::: Toasting the meringue and doin' my thang, laying on vanilla wafers. Keeping hands steady.
Both::: The McBride's famous banana pudding is finally ready.
Lynn Sr.::: You did it, Clyde. Now let's get those specials out.
Clyde::: Here you are, Mr. Grouse. Some of the McBrides famous banana pudding! Care for a little whipped cream?
Mr. Grouse::: Hit me! Mmm. Now this is tasty!
Scoots::: What's that you're holding?
Clyde::: The McBrides famous banana pudding! Wanna try some, Scoots?
Scoots::: Oh, you had me at pudding. I won't be needing my dentures!  Woo hoo! Mama's free! 
Lynn Sr.::: I'm just... I'm just glad you're happy. Quick, let's get back to the kitchen. Woo! Listen, Clyde, I'm sorry for throwing you into the fire today. I mean, you know, I completely understand if you don't want to be a restaurant owner anymore.
Clyde::: Are you kidding? I'm more excited now than ever! Ditties, wacky customers, and an actual fire!
Lynn Sr.:::  Maybe don't tell your dad's about the fire.
Clyde::: Today was such a blast, Mr. Loud. I never knew being a chef/restaurant owner could be so exciting!
Lynn Sr.::: Well, your banana pudding recipe saved the day.  Stay right here. I have an idea. Do you think you could ah, well, I mean, could you, could you add it to my recipe book?
Clyde::: Really? Sure! Bananas, vanilla wafers and who am I making this bad boy out to?
Lynn Sr.:::  Lynn Loud Senior, please.
Clyde::: Well, I think that's my ride. Yeah, definitely my ride. Bye, Mr. Loud!
Lynn Sr.::: See you around, Clyde! Hey, guys, there was definitely no fire here today! Yo, K-dog, you need another ice pack? Think fast!
Clyde::: Well, listeners, I hope you've enjoyed this episode of Listen Out Loud! I'm Clyde McBride and thanks for coming along for the ride!
