Lincoln::: Money. In the Loud House, there just isn't a lot of it to go around.  Ew!  Grody! Which is why, when you happen to find some, even the smallest amount...you gotta keep it to yourself.  Jackpot! 
Lola::: We heard money! A dime! No, a quarter!
Lincoln::: That's impossible. Money doesn't make a sound.
Luan::: Haven't you ever heard the expression Money talks 
Luna::: And that quarter is saying, Hand me over, bro!
Lana::: It's mine!
Leni::: Guys, let's just split it 40/40!
Lincoln::: No! None of you are getting it! I found it in the couch fair and square!
Lynn::: Wait a second! If there was one quarter down there, then maybe there's more!
Rita:::  What are they fighting over this time? A nickel under the ottoman?
Lynn Sr.::: Nope. A quarter down the sofa.
Rita:::  We better stop them before they start biting!
Lincoln::: Ow! Lola!
Lynn Sr.::: Too late!  ALRIGHT, EVERYBODY GET UPSTAIRS AND CLEAN THE ATTIC! That's punishment for fighting over money!
Luan::: That punishment makes no cents. 
Lynn Sr.::: Upstairs!  But that was a good one.
Lynn Sr.::: AND I WANT THAT WHOLE ATTIC SPARKLING! EVEN THE BACK CORNER!
Lucy::: But the back corner was my secret dark place.
Lola:::  It's Lincoln's fault we're up here, so he can do it!
Lynn Sr.::: AND WATCH OUT FOR THAT LOOSE FLOORBOARD!
Lincoln:::  What loose floorboard?  Stupid loose floorboard...  Hey, what's this? 
Lincoln:::  Hey, guys! Check it out! I found this letter from the original owner! She says she's hidden money in the house!
Lori:::  Yeah, right, Lincoln. Quit stalling. You're not getting out of cleaning the attic.
Leni, Luna, Luan, Lynn, Lucy, Lana, Lola, and Lisa::: YEAH!!!
Lincoln:::  Fine! I'll just do it by myself, and when I do, it'll be all mine. 
Lincoln::: Where'd everybody go?
Lincoln::: Lisa? What are you doing?
Lisa::: Uh... Just calibrating my dumb human detector.  Calibrated. 
Lynn:::  Lucy...see anything?
Lincoln::: Lynn! What are you doing?
Lynn:::  Who? Me? No no. Just putting laundry down the chute.
Lincoln:::  Laundry doesn't scream and go thud.
Lynn:::  No, but nosy brothers do.
Lincoln:::  Okay. Okay.
Lynn:::  SORRY, LUCE!
Lucy::: That's okay! I found a new secret dark place!
Lincoln:::  Looking for something, Lola?
Lola::: Uh... no. I'm just...practicing for the...uh...  ...Little Miss Chimney Sweep Pageant. 
Lana::: There's nothing up there.
Lola:::  There's gotta be! Now-- keep looking! 
Luan:::  Hand me the flashlight.
Luna::: Quick! Hide! 
Luan:::  Okay.
Lincoln::: What are you up to?
Luna::: Just...um...  ...practicing my drums? 
Luan:::  Can someone answer the ringing in my head? 
Lori::: Ugh. Gross! What is that?
Leni::: Get off my pumps!
Lori::: I'm gonna pump your face if you don't move faster!
Leni::: Let's just get this over with.
Lori:::  Ugh! Why didn't Mrs. DeMonet just tell us where the money is?
Leni::: I don't know. Let's ask her. 
Lori:::  Wait. That's just a leftover Halloween decoration.
Lincoln:::  Hey! What are you two doing?
Lori::: Uh...we're just dusting! 
Leni::: Wait. I thought we were looking for the money.
Lincoln::: I KNEW IT!
Lincoln::: Okay, admit it, you're all looking for the money, aren't you?
Leni::: Obviously!
Lynn::: Uh, duh!
Luna::: Heck, yes, we are!
Luan::: Where'd you find your first clue, Sherlock?
Lincoln::: You guys didn't even believe the money existed! I'm the one who should get it!
Lori:::  Forget that! I'm finding it for myself!
Leni::: Not if I find it first!
Luna::: Yeah, dream on!
Lana::: IT'S MINE!
Lynn Sr.::: Obviously, you haven't learned your lesson.  Back to the attic!
Lincoln::: The answer must be in here somewhere. I know it. Reflect upon what I said here. What could that mean?  Reflect! Duh!  I'm just going to be over here...cleaning the, uh...the dirty thing... 
Lucy:::  What's that?!
Lincoln:::  Ah! Nothing!
Lynn:::  Lincoln found another letter!
Sisters::: READ IT!
Lincoln::: Okay, okay! Calm down! 
Lincoln::: You guys, maybe we should listen to her and stop fighting.
Lori:::  Yeah...Lincoln's right...as soon as we're done cleaning here, we should totally work together to find the money. 
Lola::: Hey! Lori's going after the money!
Lincoln::: Wait! 
Lincoln::: Guys, the letter! Remember what Sharon DeMonet said!
Lola:::  Forget Sharon DeMonet! It's every man for himself!
Lincoln:::  Yaaaah! 
Lana::: Smell the money, boy!  Now go find more!  HEY, SPIT IT OUT, CHARLES!! So help me, I will get that dollar back EVEN IF I HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT THE OTHER END!! 
Lucy:::  I summon you from the great beyond...Mrs. Sharon DeMonet! Tell me where your fortune is. Speak to me, oh, spirit.  Come on, lady! Just tell me where the dough is!
Lincoln::: What did Sharon say?
Lynn::: SHARON SAID TO GET OUT OF OUR ROOM!!!
Luan::: Hey, look!  I found the bread!  And the cheddar, and the lettuce, and the clams?  Ew! No wonder someone threw this out.
Lincoln::: Hey, what-
Luna::: STAY OUT! THIS IS OUR TURF! 
Lana:::  HEY! GET BACK HERE!! THAT'S MY DOLLAR!!
Lincoln::: Have you found it?
Lola::: OH, NO, YOU DON'T! SEARCH YOUR OWN ROOM!
Lincoln::: Duh. Why didn't I think of that?  WHERE ARE YOU?!
Lincoln:::  BACK! BACK, YOU ANIMALS!
Leni:::  I FOUND IT!
Sisters::: YOU FOUND THE MONEY?!
Leni::: No! My missing floral pump!
Siblings:::  Aww!
Lola::: The money's not up here! Maybe it's downstairs!
Lola::: The dining room!
Luna::: The living room!
Luan::: Lily's room!
Lori::: We've literally searched the whole house, and nothing!
Leni::: Hello? My floral pump is not nothing.
Luna::: Maybe we missed something in the letter!
Lola::: Look what you did!
Lana::: You're the one who ripped it!
Luna::: Dude, how are we gonna find the money now?
Lincoln:::  We're not.
Lana::: Why?
Luan::: What are you talking about?
Lincoln::: 'Cause all we did was fight over it. And this is exactly what Sharon DeMonet warned us about.  How about this? From now on, any time we find money, whether it's a hidden fortune or even this quarter...  ...we all share it equally.
Lisa::: Okay.
Luan::: Sure.
Lori::: Sounds good.
Luna::: Yeah, I kinda like that.
Lana::: I'll even share the dollar I got back from Charles. 
Lincoln:::  Let's not...
Lori:::  Aw...we're sorry, Lily. Did your noisy sisters and brother wake you? 
Lynn::: Hey. What's that stuck on Lily's bottom?
Lincoln::: It's...a map!
Lincoln:::  But wait. How could she have known the map would be on Lily's bottom?
Lola:::  Who cares?! Let's find the money!
Lincoln::: X marks the spot.
Lisa:::  Ooh! I love solving for X!
Sisters:::  DIG! DIG! DIG! DIG!
Lucy:::  I've got some experience digging holes. 
Sisters::: DIG! DIG! DIG! DIG!
Luan::: Digging is fun for the hole family!  Get it?
Sisters::: DIG! DIG! DIG! DIG!
Lana:::  Okay, everyone. Stand back. Luna? A little digging music?
Luna::: You got it, sis! 
Lincoln::: It's locked!
Leni::: I got this.  What? There's more to my head than just air, you know.
Lola::: Five...hundred...DOLLARS!!!
Lincoln::: So, if we share it equally, that means we each get, uh...
Lisa::: 45.4545455 dollars each.
Luna::: YEAH! WOO-HOO!
Lucy::: Yay. Yay. Yay.
Lola:::  ONE! TWO! THREE!
Rita::: It was really nice of you to give up your work bonus. Are you ever gonna tell them that you're Sharon DeMonet?
Lynn Sr.::: Nah.
Rita::: I have to admit. It's nice to see them sharing money and not fighting over it.
Lynn Sr.::: Yep. All part of Sharon's plan.
Rita::: Was destroying the house part of Sharon's plan?
Lynn Sr.::: No. No it was not.
Rita::: Well, now she can...Sharon DeCleanUp! 
Lynn Sr.:::  Money. There just isn't a lot of it in the Loud House. But when there is, it's good to know that from now on, the kids will share it.  Ooh! A dime!  I'll just, uh...keep this one to myself.
