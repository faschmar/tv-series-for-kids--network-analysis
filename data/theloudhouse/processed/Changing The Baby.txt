Lincoln::: Hey, Lynn, do you wanna read the latest Ace Savvy comic with me?
Lynn:::  A. Comics are boring. B. Put on some pants. And C. ya later. 
Lincoln::: Hey, Luan, do you wanna watch a science-fiction movie with me?
Mr. Coconuts::: Science fiction stinks, and that's a science fact.
Luan:::  I agree with Mr. Coconuts.
Lincoln:::  Hey, Lola, do you want to check out my coin collection? I just got this one from Poland. It's called a z≈Çoty.
Lola::: Lame! What's the point of money that you can't spend?
Lincoln::: Hey, Lucy, do you want to go ghost hunting with me?
Lucy::: Why would I want to hunt my friends?
Lincoln::: Hey, Lana, you wanna try half of my peanut butter and sauerkraut sandwich?
Lana::: Uh, I eat some grody things, but that is disgusting. 
Game announcer::: ROUND 1: FIGHT!
Lincoln::: Hey, Leni, you wanna play video games?
Leni::: Those things will rot your brain. Besides, I have fashion magazines to look at.
Lincoln:::  You'd think that with all these sisters, there'd be just one that likes the same things I like. But sadly, that's not the case.  Even you, Lily. Sure you're hanging out with me now, but someday you're gonna be into your own things and we'll have nothing in common.  Unless...  That's it! You don't have your own things yet! You're like an unformed lump of clay! But if I can mold you, then someone in this house will finally like the things I like!
Clyde::: Hey, Lincoln! What has two thumbs and totally wants to hang out with his best friend?  This guy!
Lincoln:::  Sorry, Clyde. I'm in the middle of something important. I'm changing the baby.
Clyde::: 'Something important'? But what's more important than hanging out with this guy? 
Lincoln::: It's just you and me, Lily! We're gonna have the best time together!
Clyde::: Lily?!
Lincoln::: Here are all the things that make life worth living.
Lily:::  Blankie!
Lincoln:::  No, no, no. You don't like this. You like this.  Starship Groupers! My favorite underwater intergalactic adventure.  Pew-pew-pew! Check this out. It's a 500-piece replica of the starship.  Built by yours truly.  Oh, you like it? Here you go! 
Lily:::  Pew-pew! Pew-pew!
Lincoln::: That's right! Pew pew pew!  Uh, Lily? You gotta, you know, try to be...  ...careful!
Lily::: Pew-pew...?
Lincoln:::  That's okay. I wanted to get the 600 piece model anyway.
Lincoln::: Coin collecting is an awesome hobby, Lily. You collect coins from all around the world, then spend hours of fun carefully organizing them by country and denomination.  Who loves a Zloty? Lily does!
Lincoln::: Uh, Lily?
Lincoln::: Thanks Zloty...
Lincoln::: This is my favorite sandwich, Lily. Peanut butter and sauerkraut. You can't chew it yet, but...  ...you can drink it!
Lily::: Poo-poo! 
Lincoln::: Cheers!
Lincoln::: Okay, Lily, this is my favorite crime fighter, Ace Savvy.  And this is an Ace Savvy mobile I made especially for you.  Now look into the mobile.  You will love Ace Savvy.  You will love Ace Savvy.
Lily:::  Ace Savvy...
Lincoln:::  Yes! That's my girl!  I guess we should have done this before the peanut butter and sauerkraut.
Lincoln::: Whoo-hoo! Come on, Lily. I can't wait to show you more of my favorite things! 
Clyde::: I don't get it.  I've been watching Lincoln all day, and I still don't see what Lily has that I don't.  Come on, guys. Let's find out.
Lincoln::: Way to go, Lily!  Put your arms up.  Let's see if we can find you a white wig.  Hurry up, Lily.
Clyde::: Hmm...
Lincoln::: Amazing! You really are the best!
Lily:::  Blankie!
Lincoln::: You don't need this anymore, Lily. 
Clyde:::  I still don't get what's so great about this baby, but if that's what Lincoln wants...  Hey!  I'm having a moment here!
Lori:::  Um...what's going on?
Lincoln::: You guys never wanna do the stuff I like, so I taught Lily to do it.  Now I won't bother you. Everybody wins!
Game announcer::: KO! PLAYER LILY WINS!
Lincoln::: Well...not everybody.
Lincoln:::  And Ace Savvy defeated the evil Card Countess. The end.  Thanks for the best day ever.  I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship. 
Lincoln::: Rise and shine, Lily! We've got a lot to do today.
Lynn:::  Now batting, Number 2, Lily Loud!
Lincoln:::  Huh?
Lincoln::: Whoa! Lynn, what are you doing?
Lynn::: Dude, you're not the only one in this family who doesn't have anyone to do stuff with. Lily's gonna be my sports buddy.
Lincoln:::  Hey! This was my idea, and I want her back!
Lynn:::  You don't own her!  She wants to hang with me!
Luan::: Introducing Luan Loud and her amazing dummy, Lil Lil!  Say, Lily, who's your favorite singer? Lady...
Lily::: Gaga!
Luan::: What's your favorite Hawaiian platter?
Lily::: Poo-poo!
Lynn:::  Hey! That's no dummy! That's my cleanup hitter!
Lincoln::: No, she's mine!
Lynn::: Gimme that dummy!
Lincoln, Lynn, and Luan::: Lily?
Lucy::: This is Grandma Harriet.
Lucy::: And this is Abraham Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Uh, Lucy... What are you doing?
Lucy::: I'm introducing Lily to my ghost friends.
Lincoln:::  She already has a friend named Lincoln! 
Lucy::: Sigh...
Lincoln::: Black is not your color. Orange is!
Lincoln:::  Dang it!
Lori::: Now, Dylan can only pick one girl to spend the rest of his life with. And it'd better be Marisol.  Yeah, you're right. Maybe he will be happier with Tiffany.
Lincoln:::  Give her back, Lori!
Lori::: Why should you get her? I've literally been waiting 17 years for someone in this family who likes the things I like!
Leni:::  HELP!
Leni::: Oh, thank goodness. I got in here to show Lily my fashion magazine, but now I can't get out of this baby prison! 
Lincoln::: Upsy-daizy.
Lori::: There you go, Leni.
Leni:::  Agoo.
Lily::: Poo-poo?
Lincoln::: Hold it! Are you nuts?!
Lisa::: Come on, Lincoln! No one in this family ever willingly lets me do experiments on them!
Lincoln::: Lisa! She's a baby!
Lisa::: I was going to give her a sucker afterward. 
Lincoln:::  Look, everyone just stay away from Lily! She's my little Lincoln!
Lori, Leni, Luan, Lynn, Lucy, and Lisa:::  Uuuuh...
Lincoln::: What?  DANG IT!
Luna::: STAGE DIVE! WOO!  WOO!
Lincoln, Lori, Leni, Luna, Luan, Lynn, Lucy, and Lisa:::  Where's Lily?!
Lola::: More tea, Lady Lilington?
Lana::: She doesn't wanna have a dumb tea party. She wants to play with Izzy! 
Lola::: No she doesn't!
Lana::: Yes she does!
Lola::: No she doesn't!
Lana::: Yes she does!
Luna::: Dudes, give her back! We were in the middle of a jam sesh!
Lisa::: She was my specimen!
Lucy::: We were talking to Great Grandma Harriet.
Lynn::: We were playing ball!
Luan::: We were getting ready to take our show on the road!
Leni::: We were gonna look at my magazines!
Lori::: We were watching Dylan's date!
Lucy::: BT-dubs, Lori, Great-Grandma Harriet knows you regifted her brooch, and she's not happy about it.
Lola and Lana::: GIVE US BACK LILY!
Girls:::  WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?!
Lori::: I'll take that. 
Lincoln::: Oh, no, you don't! 
Luan::: Whoops. Sorry, Linc!  Sorry, dummy! 
Leni::: Ha! Na-na-na, na-na-na!  LILY'S INVISIBLE!
Lucy::: Boo.
Lucy::: Boo.
Lana::: Dang it...
Lincoln::: Look! We all want Lily to be our mini-me, right? Well, there's only one way to settle this. We'll let Lily choose.
Lincoln::: Now, whoever Lily crawls to is the one she wants to be with. Agreed?
Lincoln::: Come on! It's Ace Savvy!
Luan::: Wooden you like to be my friend?
Lynn::: Low and inside!
Lana::: Izzy!
Leni::: Look at the magazine!
Lori::: Marisol?
Lola::: Extra sugar!
Luna::: Walk this way.
Lucy::: Abe Lincoln.
Lisa::: I have more suckers!
Clyde::: LINCOLN! You wanna hang out with babies?  Then let's hang. 
Lincoln::: Hey, look! Lily's coming to me!
Lynn::: Nuh-uh! To me!
Lincoln::: To me!
Lynn::: To me!
Loud Kids::: SHE CHOSE CLYDE?!
Clyde::: I have something to say to you, Little Miss Friend Stealer!  You are...  ...absolutely adorable! No wonder Lincoln wants to hang with you! 
Lincoln:::  Clyde, why are you wearing a diaper?
Clyde::: You replaced me with Lily, so I thought this was the only way to win you back.
Lincoln::: I'd never replace you. You're my best friend.
Lily:::  Blankie!
Lincoln::: Her blankie...of course! Now I get it, you guys. We can't mold Lily. No matter what we do, she's always gonna want the things she wants. Besides, I forgot I already have someone who likes everything I like. What do you say, Clyde? Wanna hang?
Clyde::: Sorry, Lincoln. Lily and I have plans. Hey, Lily! What has four thumbs and loves milk?
Clyde and Lily:::  These guys!
Lori:::  Bobby, does  still have that brooch I gave her?
