Bobby::: Okay, Abuelo. Presenting the new and improved mercado. Ta-da.
Hector:::  What am I looking at here, Roberto?
Bobby::: A new business strategy! If we offer a cafe with free wi-fi, people will spend all day here.
Hector::: I don't want them here all day.
Bobby::: But if customers are here longer, they'll buy more.
Maybelle:::  Bobby, your wifi doesn't work.  Is the password still 'password'?
Hector::: The password is 'get out'. 
Maybelle::: Is that one word or two?
Bobby::: Abuelo, what are you doing?
Hector:::  A tried and true Casagrandes' business strategy. Take note, Roberto.  Shoo!
Maybelle::: Ow!
Hector:::  Shoo!
Vito::: Hey!
Bobby::: Okay, don't like that idea?  I have plenty more. Ooh.  What if we gave the mercado a cooler, catchier name, like 'The Merc'.
Hector:::  Ooh, I'm thinking 'The No'.
Bobby:::  Okay, Bobby. Plenty of ideas.  Uh... Ooh.  What if we made a commercial?
Hector:::  What if we didn't.
Bobby::: Okay,  this is my big one. Pet a bunny while you shop. Aah! What? Take it in.
Hector::: And take it out. Roberto, I've been doing this for thirty years. I'm the most successful market on the block for a reason.
Bobby::: Well, I've been doing this for a long time, too. And I'm gonna prove my ideas work.
Hector::: Great, just not in my mercado.
Bobby::: Then maybe I'll take my ideas and my tables somewhere else.  You know who else didn't want to change? The dinosaurs. And where are they?  Wait, where are the dinosaurs?  Where... are... dinosaurs?  Extinct?!
Mr. Hong:::  Bobby, what a great idea.  I've been meaning to put a table out here.
Vito::: Ah, what do you's know? The dinosaurs got taken out by an asteroid.
Bobby::: Oh, hey Mr. Hong. Yeah, it's a good way to bring in customers. You know, if you like money.
Mr. Hong::: I love money. As it so happens, I'm looking for a hard worker with great ideas, and a great attitude.
Bobby::: Me, me, also me. Ha! I think I'm your man, Mr. Hong.
Mr. Hong::: Call me Injae.
Bobby::: Here's your kimbap.  How are my two favorite people?
Vito::: Oh, Bobby, these kimmy pops are delicious.
Maybelle::: And the wifi hasn't skipped a beat.
Bobby::: You two keep grubbing and surfing.  Hey Mr. Hong.
Mr. Hong:::  Bobby, your free wifi has brought in so many new customers. And they're all eating my kimbap.
Bobby::: If you like that, I have a whole book of business strategies.
Mr. Hong::: Let's do all of them.
Bobby and Mr. Hong::: We're gonna be rich!
Hector::: I can't believe he's working at Hong's now. What's he doing there?
Sergio::: I believe the term is 'crushing it'.
Carl::: Maybe Bobby's ideas aren't so bad.
Hector::: You're fired.
Carl::: Come on Sergio, I know a place with free wifi where we can hang out.
Sergio:::  Could go for some kimbap.
Rosa:::  So, how was everyone's day?
Hector:::  Just how I like it. The same.
Bobby:::  Well, my day was great, Abuela.
Rosa::: Que bueno mis muchachos.
Bobby::: My new boss is open to all my ideas. Unlike my old boss.
Hector::: Well, your old boss, who looks pretty good for his age, is doing fine without new ideas.
Carlota::: I had a pretty good day, I--
Bobby:::  Well, my new boss is not just fine, he's raking in the dough.
Hector::: Well, then your new boss should pay for your potatoes, because I'm eating all of these.
Bobby::: Mr. Hong would share his potatoes.
Hector::: Then, you should go to Mr. Hong's.
Bobby::: I already asked, and he has plans tonight.
Hector::: That's... too... --bad!
Bobby and Hector::: He started it!
Hector::: Double chancla, it wasn't even my fault.
Carlota::: Abuelo, have you seen this commercial Bobby made with Mr. Hong?
Hector:::  What a tacky bunch of bo-bos.
Carlota::: It's catchy Abuelo. Also, it has a million views.
Hector::: Big deal, views are not customers.
Carlota::: Yeah, but those are. 
Hector:::  Huh.  What's going on here?
Shopper::: We're in line for Hong's.
Bobby::: All this success is because of me and my great ideas. Oh, and in case it wasn't clear... that dinosaur is you. And dinosaurs are extinct. Bobby out.
Mr. Hong::: Bobby, you're a genius! For the first time in years I can take a day off. I'm going to Great Lakes City Water Park. They opened a super slide.  You're in charge.  Super slide!
Bobby::: This is the moment you've always dreamed of Bobby Santiago.  It's time for the big one.
Hector::: ðŸŽµ Come and dance, at the Casagrande's mercado. ðŸŽµ
Maria:::  Hola, papa.  Were you just working on your own jingle for the mercado?
Hector::: Jingle? Que jingle? You must be hearing things, Mija.
Maria:::  You know, you could have heard Bobby out.
Hector::: I've been running the mercado my way for decades. It works.
Maria::: No one is saying it doesn't, but Bobby wants to make his merc on the mercado too.
Hector:::  Ah.
Bobby::: Hi, everyone, today we have a two for one sale on garbage bags, and our new special... hug a bunny while you shop.
Shopper::: No way.
Bobby::: Pick up your bunny next to the register.
Ronnie Anne::: Uh, Bobby, what's the deal with the bunnies?
Bobby::: Thinking outside the box, Ronnie Anne. Offering convenience and cuddles.
Ronnie Anne::: Are you sure that's a good idea?
Carl:::  Aw. He's so fluffy. Who's a good bunny?
Vito::: Hey, I heard you can shop with your pets today.
Bobby::: Not just any pets, bunnies!
Vito::: Oh, no dogs? Well, then I'll just take my business elsewhere.
Bobby::: You can bring your dogs.
Vito::: And yous can have my business.
Shopper #2::: What about my turtle?
Shopper #3::: And my gerbils?
Bobby::: Here at Hong's, we take your feedback seriously. From now on, all animals are welcome.
Ronnie Anne::: Hey, Bobby, don't you think that's going a bit too far?
Bobby::: I'm on a hot streak, Ronnie Anne! And the customer is always right.  The customer is not always right!
Male Shopper::: I just wanted toilet paper!
Ronnie Anne::: Bobby, what are you going to do?
Bobby::: Don't worry, I have something in my idea book. Got it right here.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no, no!  Aah! My book! This is a disaster! Maybe they'll calm down if I turn off all the lights. 
Ronnie Anne::: Abuelo!
Hector:::  Huh?
Ronnie Anne::: Bobby needs your help!
Hector::: Oh, what does Mr. Big Shot need with me?
Ronnie Anne::: The animals are destroying Hong's!
Hector::: What? We'd better hurry.
Ronnie Anne::: Thanks, Abuelo! I knew you'd help.
Hector:::  Oh, no. I'm just going to watch. You're in charge now, Lalo.
Maybelle::: Bobby, I need my morning mango.  Oh, you washed it for me. Thanks, Bobby.
Ronnie Anne::: Bobby!  Abuelo! Do soething!
Bobby::: They're cuddling me to death!  Abuelo, help me.  The softness. Oh, the softness!
Hector::: Okay, this has gone on long enough.  Roberto, time for our tried and true Casagrande business strategy.
Ronnie Anne::: I'll get the cages.
Both::: Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Ha! Shoo! Shoo!
Bobby::: We did it! Just in time.
Mr. Hong::: Bobby! What happened to my store?
Bobby::: Mr. Hong, you look relaxed and tan.  I'm fired, aren't I?
Bobby::: You were right, Abuelo, my ideas were terrible.
Hector:::  They can't all be winners. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try. In fact, you were doing so well at Hong's, I was a little jealous.
Bobby::: Ah, you're just saying that.
Hector::: I'm sorry, Bobby. Maybe I should have been more open minded.
Bobby::: And I'm sorry I called you a dinosaur.  Does this mean I can have my job back?
Hector::: Only if you bring your book of ideas.
Bobby::: It was destroyed by a lemur with a bad haircut. But I've still got a million more ideas!
Hector::: Baby steps, Roberto. Let's just start with one.
Bobby::: Ooh, I know exactly what I want to do first.
Hector::: Bienvenidos.
The Casagrandes:::  Welcome to the Casagrande Mercado.
Hector::: Good idea, Roberto.
