Lincoln:::  ​Mmm! Mac 'n' cheese bites!
Liam::: ​ Hey! Pssst! Lincoln! What’d you get for Number 1?
Lincoln:::  ​Mac 'n' cheese!
Liam:::  Thanks, buddy.
Zach::: Really? I thought the Native Americans gave the Pilgrims corn.
Liam::: If Lincoln says mac 'n' cheese, that's good enough for me.
Lincoln:::  I can't focus at all today.  Last night, Dad made his famous mac 'n' cheese bites for dinner. And in order to make all that cheesy goodness last, I saved three bites for after school. But if I'm going to get through this day without losing my mind, I'm just gonna have to stop thinking about them.
Cheryl:::  The following students please report to the principal's office: Mac and Chaz.
Mrs. Johnson::: Alright, everyone. Pencils down and let's go over the worksheet.  Who has the answer to Number 1?​
​Liam:::​ ​​ Oh, oh, oh, me! It's mac 'n' cheese. And if I'm wrong, you can flunk me. ​
Lynn Sr.:::  Today's the big day!  Just got to chill the Duck Liver Pâté.  I'll show him that I'm a star with my yummy take on caviar. 
Rita:::  I love that confidence, honey. When is the investor getting here?
Lynn Sr.::: In a few hours. Just think, if he likes my food, I can open my own restaurant. Here, try this Foie gras foam!  And here's the second course. 
Rita:::  Uh, this is just air...in a jar.
Lynn Sr.::: Lemon air in a jar. high-end yet low-cal.
Rita::: Honey, no offense, but, why are you making all this showy stuff? What's wrong with your famous 'Lynn-sagna'?
Lynn Sr.::: Honey, this is Timothy McCole. This guy travels all over the world tasting exciting and exotic food.  I can't just serve a hunk of noodles.
Rita::: Well, I like the hunk who made those noodles and I think anything he cooks is delicious. 
Lynn Sr.::: Can you say that again when he's here?
Lincoln:::  Mac 'n' cheese!  Two bites?! I saved three! 
Lincoln:::  Alright, which of you vultures swiped one of my mac 'n' cheese bites?! If you guys wanted one so badly, you should've saved some of your own.
Lana::: I'm not saying it was me.  But if I did take one, I only did it 'cause Lola ate the rest of Dad's tater tot bake. I was saving that!
Lola::: I'm not copping to eating the tater tot bake, but if I did, it would because Luan ate the last slice of Dad's pie, which I was saving!
Luan::: Actually, I didn't eat it.
Lola::: Oh, my bad.
Luan::: I smashed it in Lynn's face.
Lola::: 
Lincoln::: Guys, how do you not see that this is a problem? Our fridge is like the Wild West!
Lori::: Look, Lincoln. Nobody likes having their leftovers swiped, but we're a big family. You can't expect to protect every little bite of food that you want.
Lincoln:::  Oh, can't I?
Lori:::  No, you can't!
Luan's Thoughts::: Hmm, I really want one of those mac 'n' cheese bites, but Lincoln's gonna have a conniption. But then again, watching Lincoln have a conniption is fun.
Luan::: Owww! 
Lincoln:::  That'll teach her. 
Luan:::  Oh! So, we're protecting our stuff now, huh?  Fine by me!
Leni's Thoughts::: Ooh, one of Dad's yummy brownies. But, wait, didn't Luan call this? Well, she won't mind if I just break off a little corner.
Leni:::  Ow!
Luan:::  The gloves are off, now. 
Leni's Thoughts::: Luan put that there to protect her leftovers?! Well, I can play that game too!
Lincoln:::  That's it! You guys really crossed the line this time! 
Luna:::  I'd say that line was crossed when this happened, brah!
Lana:::  Or this!
Luan:::  Or this!
Lily:::  Ga-Ga!
Lincoln::: This is crazy! We can't go on like this! If someone could gently let me down, I think I have an idea.
Lincoln:::: I think we can all agree: basic order needs to be restored. So with an assist from Lisa, I came up with a plan.
Luan::: 
Lisa::: Sorry!  Per Lincoln's request, I calculated the refrigerator's cubic footage and divided it into eleven equally sized zones, creating the optimal conditions for what I'd like to call: Dairy Détente.
Lincoln:::  Everybody gets a zone. And the genius part is that no one can mistake theirs for someone else's because they're color-coded. 
Sisters :::  Oooh!
Lincoln::: All we have to do now is divide up Dad's leftovers and put them in our zones.
Lori::: I call Dad's stuffed peppers!
Lynn::: And I got dibs on his fried chicken!
Leni::: I get his mine strone.
Lisa::: Uh, Leni, it's pronounced 'Minestrone'.
Leni:::  I call it 'Mine Strone' 'cause it's mine!
Lincoln:::  Nice job. Thanks for the assist.
Lisa::: You're welcome. For payment, I will happily accept your last mac 'n' cheese bite.
Lincoln:::  Not a chance.
Lynn Sr.:::  Wait 'till he tries my Uni-surprise. This organic beet juice will open his eyes.  That investor guy will feel like a royal when he tastes my risotto with...   Dang it! I forgot the truffle oil!  Come on, Lynn. You're better than that! 
Luan::: Next stop: Yellow Zone! Can't wait to dig into Dad's mashed potatoes.
Lisa::: And my destination is the Green Zone, where I intend to feast on Father's savory meatloaf.  Num-num!
Luan:::  Eww! Gross!  Someone put something in my zone called 'Uni'. Whatever that is.
Lisa::: That would be a low-fat, high-protein, globular animal in the Echinoidea class. Street name: sea urchin.
Luan::: Well, sea you later.  Must be one of Lori's gross health foods, and it does not belong in my zone. 
Lisa:::  Ech! Lucy's homemade blood does not belong in my zone. Buh-bye. 
Lori::: Eww! What is this black goo?  Eww, smells fishy. Must be Lana's bait.  Not in my zone!
Lola::: 'Duck Liver Pate?' Eww! Lisa! If you want to dissect animals, don't put their icky organs in my zone! 
Timothy McCole:::  If they can't be on time, just cancel the appointment and move my 3:15 to 3 o'clock, my 4:15 to 4 o'clock and my...  pedicure to 5:00.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, hi there! Lynn Loud Sr., I am so glad to meet-
Timothy McCole:::  Timothy McCole, but call me Tim because 'Timothy' takes more time to say and time is the one thing I don't have. Now, let's see what you got for me.
Lynn Sr.::: Err, don't worry, Tim. You'll be eating before you know it. 
Timothy McCole::: Is everything alright?
Lynn Sr.:::  Um... uh... Of course! I-i-i always scream when I open the fridge. See? 
Timothy McCole::: Okay, I guess every chef has his own style.
Lynn Sr.::: Uh, Tim, could I interest in a apéritif? 
Timothy McCole::: Well, I'd really rather-
Lynn Sr.:::  Good. Here's a juice box. Go sit down.  I'll call you once dinner's ready.  Where are all my ding-dang ingredients?!
Lincoln:::  Dad, are you okay? We heard a woman yelling.
Lynn Sr.::: No, I'm not okay! There's an investor in the living room waiting to try my food and all my ingredients are gone!
Lynn Sr.:::  Well, there's my pâté.
Lynn Sr::: And my caviar.
Lynn Sr::: And my uni! Cliff, how did you get your paws on my ingredients?!
Lori::: It wasn't Cliff's fault, Dad. We threw out your ingredients. He must have gotten them out of the trash.
Lynn Sr.::: What?! Why would you do that?
Luan::: We didn't know they were yours.
Lincoln::: See, we kinda divided the fridge into zones, because we'd been stealing each other's leftovers.
Lori::: So, when we found your stuff in our zones, we assumed someone was violating the system.
Lynn Sr.::: You kids know I love your creative conflict resolutions but now I have nothing to serve my investor.  And he's almost done with his juice box!
Lincoln::: We're sorry, Dad. We never meant for something like this to happen.
Lynn Sr.:::  Well, I guess my restaurant dreams are in the toilet. I'd better go tell 'No-Time Tim' his afternoon just opened up.
Lincoln:::  Dad, wait! What if you serve him your leftovers? 
Lori::: Yeah! That's a great idea. You can take the stuffed pepper I've been saving.
Lisa::: And, uh, I can part with your meatloaf.
Leni:::  And I'll give you this soup. Mine strone is now your strone.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, that's a nice thought, guys, but Tim won't want any of that. He's used to eating the most amazing food in the world.
Lucy::: But your leftovers are the most amazing food in the world.
Luna::: Truth, Pop-star. Look what we did to keep them to ourselves.
Lynn Sr.:::  Well... I guess it's worth a shot.
Timothy McCole::: Well, Lynn, I'm gonna give it to you straight. This is one of...  ...the best meals I've ever eaten.
Lynn Sr.:::  I knew it was a dumb idea! I should have never served it! I, um...  Wait, what?
Timothy McCole::: I've been all over the world and every chef serves me the same thing: caviar, pâté, uni. It's boring and uninspired. Do you know what the last place I ate, the chef served me 'Air in a Jar'.
Lynn Sr.:::  What a bozo!
Timothy McCole::: But your food is classic, comforting, and delicious. And when you travel as much as I do, there's nothing better than food that tastes like home.  Ooh, I want to be in the Lynn Loud business!
Lynn Sr.:::  Wow! Thank you, Tim. I don't know what to say! 
Timothy McCole:::  I don't do hugs.  You got Tim. 
Lola::: We do hugs.
Rita::: So, how did it go?
Lynn:::  Aww, Dad kicked butt!
Lynn Sr.:::  Yeah, I'm one step closer to my dream of owning a restaurant.
Rita:::  I'm so proud of you, honey. I guess he liked your uni and your lemon air.
Lynn Sr.::: Actually, he liked my leftover 'Lynn-sagna', just like you said.
Lana::: And all his other leftovers too.
Rita::: That's wonderful! This calls for a celebration. Who wants some of Dad's chocolate cake?
Sisters:::  Me!
Lincoln::: Wait, I didn't see any chocolate cake in the fridge.
Rita::: Well, that's because I stashed it under the couch.  What? I can't claim any leftovers?
Lynn::: I'll go score us some. 
Rita:::  Lynn, wait!
