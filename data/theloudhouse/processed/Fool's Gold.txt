Carl::: Goal!
Hector::: Carl! I'm not paying you to fool around, I'm paying you to clean up.
Carl::: Who's fooling around? I'm sorting mystery cans.  This one is either canned corn or fake snakes.  Or neither.
Carlos::: Finding antiques is all the payment I need. Like this toaster from 1950.  And a piece of toast from 1950.
CJ::: And a hairy spider from today.
Hector::: Look, a message in a bottle.
Carl::: Is that how you used to text, Abuelo?
Hector::: Very funny. But, yes.
Carl::: You found my letter ~ what a pleasure! Keep reading to find my treasure!  Oh! Is this for real?
Carlos:::  If I'm reading correctly this letter was written by Pancho Villa.
Carl::: Pancho who-a?
Carlos::: Aye. What are they teaching you in school? He's only one of the most famous generals of the Mexican revolution.
Hector::: The letter must have belonged to my great-great-grandfather.  He rode with Pancho Villa.
Carlos::: Legend has it Pancho Villa buried his gold but no one's ever found it.
Carl::: Until now. We're gonna be rich!
Carl & CJ:::  We're gonna buy so much stuff!
Hector::: Callanse.  So how do we find the treasure?
Carlos::: Solve this riddle, then solve three more, find the next one lighting up the shore.
Carl::: Lighting up the shore?  That’s the lighthouse!
CJ::: To the lighthouse!
Carl & CJ:::  We’re gonna be rich. We’re gonna be rich.
Hector:::  Keep it down. We don't want anyone else finding out about our treasure, there's a lot of cheese muscles around here.
Hector & Carl::: Keeping it a secret is all for us.
Sergio::: What’s all for you?
Hector::: Uh… All this canned corn.
Sergio:::  Says you. Hello lunch.  Oh, now that’s just wrong.
CJ::: Phew. There’s the next letter.
Carl::: Go get it, Dad!
Carlos:::  Yeah, go get it, Dad.
Hector:::  I just ate six corditas, climbing's bad for my digestion.
Carlos::: Oh, did I mention that Pancho Villa's gold is estimated to be worth about three-point-two million dollars, which means split between us it’s…
Hector:::  You had me at three-point-two million dollars.  Aye, chihuahua!
CJ::: We gotta help Abuelo!
Carl:::  I can get rid of those birds! Look! An old man throwing bread!
Old Man::: Ah! Leave me alone! I’m all out of bread!  I'm all out! Please. Please stop!
Hector::: Three-point-two million dollars here I come!
Carlos::: Ooh, here’s the next clue. At the market, with the old fishmonger.
Carl:::  The next letter must be at the fish market.
Hector::: Gold, here we come.
Vito::: Gold? At the fish market?
Hector::: I mean... uh… goldfish kids are always begging for a new pet.
Vito::: Oh, I had a goldfish once, cute little guy.  What was his name? Fred?
Hector:::  Okay, bye, Vito.
Carl::: Ooh! There's the next letter.
CJ::: But, we'll have to get past that scary looking squid.
Carlos::: That's actually a giant boxing squid.
Carl:::  I think he's challenging you.
Carlos::: What? That's ridiculous-
Maybelle::: Oh, hey Casagrandes. What’s in the tank?
CJ::: Uh, nothing.
Carl:::  Just a lot of water.
Maybelle:::  I just came here for the free oyster crackers they're usually right here.
Carl::: Ooh. I think they’re all out of oyster crackers. But, look there’s a great deal on salmon, way, way over there.
Hector::: Better hurry, I hear they’re running out.
Maybelle:::  Oh, no you don’t. They better not run out of that salmon.
Carlos:::  Did anyone see that? It was the match of my life.
CJ::: Great, Dad!
Hector:::  No need for a horse or hate today. Just ride the oldest hidden railway.
Carl::: That's a subway station for sure, and I know which one's the oldest.
Carl::: Hey, there's something back here.  It's the next letter. This job calls for agent double O’ guapo.
Hector:::  Okay, but I don't think I'm gonna fit.
Carl:::  Abuelo, that's my code name.
CJ::: Did you get it?
Carl::: Almost, the letter is stuck to a piece of pizza.  Pull me out! Pull me out! Pull me out!  Got it.
Stanley::: Hey Casagrandes.  What brings you to this part of town?
Carlos::: Oh, you know just... uh... taking a tour of the subways architecture. Look at that crown molding.
CJ::: Uh… Shouldn’t you be driving the train?
Stanley::: Dang it, that’s the third time this week.
Carlos::: The last letter has been found, to claim your treasure you must monkey around.
Carl::: The treasure must be with the monkeys at the zoo. Let's go!
Hector:::  Rosa’s not gonna believe this.  We're going on a fancy vacation, we're rich. Treasure chest emoji. Monkey emoji. On our way to the zoo now.
Carlos::: Which way to the monkeys?
Sergio::: Move it, chumps! That gold’s all mine! 
Carl::: Wait, did he say gold?  He’s going after our treasure!
Maybelle::: You mean my treasure. Peace.
Carlos::: What!? How does Maybelle know?
Hector::: Nevermind, we have to beat her.
Maybelle:::  Ooh, free churros.
Hector::: The monkeys are that way.
Carlos::: This isn't the monkey cage, these are porta potties.
Stanley::: Oh yeah, someone switched the sign. Greed brings out the worst in people, huh? Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta get my gold on. Chugga chugga cha-ching! Deuces!
Carl::: Mr. Chang about the treasure too!?
Carlos::: We'll never beat him! He has a tram!
Hector::: Who needs trams, when you have Bitsy?
Carlos::: What!? How does everyone know about the gold?
Vito::: Hey, thanks for the tip, Hector. When I get the gold there's five bucks in it for you.
Carl::: Abuelo! you told Vito?
Carlos::: We should have known you couldn't keep a secret.
Hector::: I didn't tell anyone except Rosa. I can prove it.
Carl:::  You accidentally texted the whole neighborhood. Abuela is the only person you didn't text.
Hector::: Oh boy, she's not gonna like that.
Carlos::: While we're sitting here bickering, everyone's getting our gold. Dig!
CJ:::  I found something!
Maybelle:::  I’ll take that.
Everyone::: Get her!
Everyone::: No!
CJ::: I can’t believe Bitsy ate our gold.
Carlos::: I guess this is what we get for being greedy. We're supposed to be friends.
Vito::: Yeah. we’s could have just shared it.
Hector::: That's what I suggested.
Carl::: You did not.
CJ::: Hey, wait a minute.
Carl::: Maybe we can still get some treasure.
CJ:::  This isn't gold, it's just chocolate wrappers.
Carlos::: And the wrappers are coupons.  Congratulations you found the golden treasure. Here's thirty percent off for your dining pleasure. Sincerely, Pancho Villa's Tacos.
Carl::: Abuelo! You just let us on a wild goose chase for coupons?!
Hector::: Oh yeah, Pancho Villa’s Tacos. Now I remember, Rosa and I had our first date there. Ha. I must have saved that message in a bottle as a souvenir.
Stanley::: Next stop, disappointment. Chugga chugga boo-hoo.
Vito::: How are you going to make it up to us, Hector? The least you’s could do is buy us all some tacos.
Hector::: No way, that's too expensive even with thirty percent off.  Okay, okay, you can have your tacos.  A discount is a discount.
