Lola:::  Pamela, darling, break out your best china, your rarest rainbow sprinkles.  Spare no expense.
Auntie Pam::: Oh, is it allowance day already?
Lola::: You know it. I'll have two scoops of your finest gelato. 
Lana::: And I'll do my usual in a small.
Lola::: Ooh!
Waiter::: Whoa! 
Lana::: Yay! 
Lola:::  That's a small?!
Lana::: Yeah, I'd get the large, but I don't want to ruin my dinner. 
Auntie Pam::: Enjoy that Moon's Over My Pammy bucket. It's the last one. We took it off the menu to make room for our brand-new sundae: The Double Trouble.  Actually, you two could be perfect. We're looking for a set of twins to promote it. You'd get a crown and free ice cream...  for life.
Lana::: Ice cream for life?!
Lola::: And a crown?!
Loud Twins::: We'll do it!
Auntie Pam::: Oh, oh, not so fast, girls. If you wanna represent Auntie Pam's, you gotta earn it. I'm holding a contest that's open to all the twins of Royal Woods, so you'll have some competition.
Lana::: Lola, we have to win.
Lola::: We'll need to pull out all the stops. Ooh, let's wear matching outfits!  Fine, no matching outfits. But you have to take a shower!
Lana::: Deal.
Lola::: First rule of any contest: Know your enemy, and you can never lose. Who's gonna be our biggest threat?
Lana::: Mr. Grouse and Flip?!
Lola::: Um, what are you trying to pull? You're not even related!
Mr. Grouse::: What? You don't see the resemblance? 
Flip::: Ooh, it's in the flavor savers. 
Lola::: Ugh.
Lana:::  And what's Liam doing here?!
Liam::: OK, fellers, eye of the tiger.
Lola::: His twins aren't even human!
Liam::: They got every right to be here!
Scoots:::  Uh, anyone seen my twin sister Mopes? She looks just like me, except for she's on a moped. 
Lola::: No way Scoots has a twin. The universe would never be so cruel.
Mopes:::  Anyone seen my twin sister Scoots? She looks just like me, except for she's on a scooter. 
Lola::: OK, Scoots's sister is obviously just her in a wig. This contest is going to be an ice cream cake walk.
Lana::: Yeah, we're the only real twins here.
Cheryl:::  Stop the presses!  'Cause Cheryl-
Meryl::: And Meryl-
Cheryl and Meryl::: Have arrived!
Cheryl::: Sorry for being tardy, y'all. We may have gotten sucked into an episode of our favorite soap opera, Southern Hospitality.
Auntie Pam:::  Alrighty, who's ready to twin it up? Let's get this competition started!  Round 1: Taste Test.
Lana::: Down Home Double Dutch Chocolate.
Lola::: Yes!
Meryl::: Uncle Charlie's Chicory!
Auntie Pam::: Bah-bah Blueberry, you're absolutely right.
Scoots::: Shriekin' Butter Pecan.
Auntie Pam::: Round 2: Customer Service.
Cheryl::: Grip it...  ...and whip it!
Meryl::: We played a little roller derby in college.
Cheryl::: They used to call us the Slingshot Sisters. 
Auntie Pam:::  Disqualified!
Liam::: Disqualified?! For why?
Auntie Pam::: Violation of Auntie Pam's Double Trouble Contract.   I can't have my twins fighting. They need to be united.  Round 3: Ice Cream Sculpting.
Cheryl::: It's the Eiffel Tower, y'all!
Meryl::: Just like the one from Las Vegas!
Auntie Pam::: Our two final teams are Cheryl and Meryl,  and Lola and Lana!
Lana:::  Bleh!
Auntie Pam::: And now for the big moment. Our Double Trouble twins and winners of a lifetime supply of ice cream are...lo and behold, CHERYL AND MERYL!
Lola::: It's no fair. That crown and ice cream should be ours.
Liam:::  Hey, wait up, fellers!
Lana::: At least we didn't get disqualified for fighting, right?
Lola:::  Fight clause. Lana, maybe there's a way we can still win. Cheryl and Meryl just need to start bickering, and Auntie Pam will make us the Double Trouble twins!
Lana::: But how do you know they'll fight?
Lola::: 'Cause you and I are going to make them.
Lana::: Thanks for the snack break, Cheryl.
Cheryl::: My pleasure, sugar. 
Lana::: I've never heard a person talk as much as Cheryl. She said, like, a gazillion sentences, and they all started with 'sugar'.
Lola::: Does that mean you got the scoop on how to split up her and Meryl?
Lana::: It won't be easy. Those two are tight. They eat ice cream together every night. They watch all the same TV shows, like Southern Hospitality. They even double date with their boyfriends.
Lola::: Hmm. I can work with all that.
Cheryl:::  Meryl, did you spill the ice cream?! Now we got a dairy river the size of the Mississippi on our floor!
Meryl::: Don't blame me! I didn't do it!
Cheryl::: Well, no use cryin' over spilled ice cream. We got plenty more in the backup freezer.
Lola::: UGH!
Cheryl::: 'Dearest Cheryl, being with you makes my heart flutter. But I can't stand your sister. It's me or her. Signed, your boyfriend.'  Just like Mama always says, sisters before misters. Buh-bye, Darryl.
Lola:::  I hope this works.
Meryl::: Yello, Che-Meryl residence. You got Meryl.
Lola:::  Hey, sugar, it's me, your sister.
Meryl::: Hey, sugar.
Lola:::  I'm in a bit of a pickle here at school. Huggins has a bee in his office.  Actually, a lot of bees.
Lana:::  Come home safe, my babies.
Lola:::  I'm fixing to be here awhile. You should go on ahead and watch the season finale of Southern Hospitality without me.
Meryl::: What?! Well, that don't sound like you at all. You serious about this?
Lola:::  As serious as a hoedown.
Meryl::: Ooh, that is serious. And I am chompin' at the bit to find out about this pie thief.  Ooh, OK. I'll watch.
Cheryl:::  RUN, HUGGINS! THEY THINK MY BEEHIVE IS THEIR BEEHIVE!
Cheryl::: Ooh, boy, did I have a dickens of a day.  And are you watching the Southern Hospitality finale without me?!
Meryl::: Uh, you called and told me to.
Cheryl::: That is a backhoe of lies! I think I would remember something like that.
Meryl::: You calling me a fibber?
Cheryl::: If the kitten heel fits!
Meryl::: How dare you?
Cheryl::: Hmph! 
Meryl::: Oh, and BTDubs, Wayland is the pie thief!
Auntie Pam::: Welcome, all, to the debut of our Double Trouble Sundae. Exciting, isn't it, Double Trouble twins?
Cheryl and Meryl:::  Hmph!
Auntie Pam::: Who wants to cut the ribbon?
Meryl:::  I'll do it.
Cheryl::: I'm surprised you haven't already done it without me, you lowdown pie thief spoiler.
Meryl:::  Oops.
Auntie Pam:::  OK, ladies, settle down.
Cheryl:::  You missed me! 
Auntie Pam:::  You two are in violation of my Auntie Pam anti-fight clause!  As runners-up, I hereby crown you two the Double Trouble twins!
Lola:::  Us?! This is all so unexpected.
Lana::: The sign-up line for our Unlimited Double Trouble ice cream party starts here!
Lola::: And remember, it's VIP's only.
Cheryl:::  Mornin'...  Roosters. Today's lunch will be two identical twin fish sticks!  Sorry, Principal Huggins. It's just that Meryl is gone.  After our tussle at Auntie Pam's parlor, we was both madder than wet hens, so this morning, Meryl packed up her stuff and left for the bus station!
Lola::: Alright, Cheryl, let's go. Get up.
Lana::: We're getting your twin back.
Cheryl:::  What?
Lola:::  Up ahead! That must be Meryl's bus!
Cheryl::: Hurry! We're gonna miss her!
Lana::: On it!
Meryl:::  What is she doing here? 
Lola::: Look, Meryl, if you want to be mad at someone, be mad at us.
Lana::: Yeah, we wanted ice cream so bad, we tricked you two into fighting.
Lola::: It was stupid and we feel so terrible. If anyone knows how much twins need each other, it's us.
Lana::: Yeah, you can't leave, Meryl. Twins gotta stick together.
Meryl::: Well, I guess I could stay. After all, you are the soft serve to my waffle cone.
Cheryl:::  We gotta celebrate our reunion!
Lola::: You know, you should throw more twin soirees.
Scoots:::  I heard about the twin party. Guess our invite got lost in the mail.
Lola::: Spare us, Scoots. We know your 'sister' Mopes isn't real.
Mopes::: What are you lookie-loos staring at?
Scoots::: You never seen twins before?
