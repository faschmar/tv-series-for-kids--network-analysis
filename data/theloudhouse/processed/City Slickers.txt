Lori::: There it is - the big city! 
Lincoln:::  Can I get a warning next time?
Lori::: Sorry, Lincoln, I'm just so excited!
Lincoln:::  We're visiting Bobby and Ronnie Anne this weekend, so Lori can get to know the city better. I'm just tagging along for moral support, and for some of that delicious Casagrande cuisine.
Lori::: Can you believe it? As soon as I graduate, I'll literally be going to college here. 
Lincoln::: What happened to the warning?
Lori::: Sorry, I just know how much I'm going to love it here. I've always been a city girl at heart.
Lori:::  How about you? Are you excited to see Ronnie Anne?
Lincoln::: Oh, yeah! We're gonna have a blast.
Lincoln:::  I've missed her.
Frida::: A little lower. 
Maria::: A little higher.
Hector:::  Why do we even need a sign? When did we become sign people?
Carlos::: I just watched a fascinating documentary on the role of signage into expanding our freeway systems. It seems that-
Frida:::  Here, honey. Try my taquitos! 
Carlota:::  Ronnie Anne! I narrowed it down to two dresses!  Has anyone seen her?  Ronnie Anne!
Ronnie Anne:::  I may smell like dog all day, but it's worth it!
Rosa:::  Out of my way! Out of my way! I'm cleansing the place of unkind spirits!
Sergio:::  Can't see! Mayday! Mayday!
CJ::: Lincoln and Lori are here! Hooray!
Lori::: Hi, CJ!
Lincoln:::  Hey buddy, long time, no see!
Hector::: You made it!
Carolta::: Welcome back!
Carlos::: How are the road signs on your way here?
Carl::: Greetings, my lovely gazelle!
Lori:::  Oh, hey, Carl.
Rosa::: Come in! Come in!
Hector:::  Bobby's down in the bodega. Go say hi! But if he's trapped himself in the dairy case again, don't let him out. He has to learn.
Rosa:::  I wasn't sure if you wanted breakfast or lunch, so I made both!
Lincoln::: I could eat both.
Rosa:::  Te adora, mijito! 
CJ:::  Gotcha, Lincoln! Let's go! Time to walk the plank!
Lincoln::: Okay, I respect the laws of the sea, but can I eat first?
CJ::: Sure. I'm a pirate, but I'm fair.
Ronnie Anne::: Welcome back, Lame-O.
Lincoln::: Hey, Ronnie Anne! I brought you a present.
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, cool! A Royal Woods sweatshirt! 
Lincoln::: I got it at Gus' Games and Grub. Uhh, sorry it smells like garlic knots.
Ronnie Anne::: Beats smelling like a dog. Thanks! 
Lincoln::: Ow!
Frida:::  Ronnie Anne, it's Sameer calling.
Ronnie Anne:::  I'll call him back later.
Lincoln::: Who's Sameer?
Frida::: Oh, Sameer's a part of Ronnie Anne's little group of friends. They're all thick as thieves!  It's so sweet! 
Lincoln::: Cool! I'd love to meet them!
Ronnie Anne::: No, no! This weekend's all about you. Come on, we have a lot of catching up to do. 
CJ::: Hey! Get back here with my prisoner! 
Lori::: Boo-Boo Bear!
Bobby::: Babe!
Lori::: Oh, you're so cold.
Bobby::: I just got out of the dairy case. Come see my latest improvement to the bodega.  I organized the money so all the presidents face the same way.
Lori::: You're such a businessman.
Bobby::: Thanks! But it took me so long.  Now I have work until five.
Lori::: That's totes okay. I can spend the day exploring the city!
Bobby::: I hope you love it as much as I do!
Lori::: I'm sure I will.  I'm a city girl at heart.
Bobby::: Babe, can you let me out?  I was trying to get you a soda!
Lincoln::: Oh, no, no, no, no!
Ronnie Anne::: Oh, yeah!
Lincoln::: Ah!
Ronnie Anne::: Boom!
Lincoln::: No! Dang it!
Ronnie Anne::: Yes!  I still own you! Wanna play again?
Lincoln::: Maybe later. Let's go see the city.
Ronnie::: Eh, there's nothing to see. Just a bunch of tall buildings and smelly subway cars.
Maria::: Oh, honey. There's much more to the city than that. You should definitely show Lincoln around.
Frida::: Do it, Mija. You know we're just gonna stare at you until you agree.
Ronnie Anne:::  Ugh, fine.
Maria::: Come on, Frida, let's see what you got!
Lori::: Wow! This is literally the city girl look I was dreaming of! I can't believe you have all this.
Carlota::: When you thrift as much as I do, you pretty much have everything.
CJ::: Surprise! Pirate attack! 
Carl::: Lori, my love! Allow me to be your guide today. I can show you the most romantic spots of our fine metropolis.
Carlota::: Oh, fancy words from someone with a pudding mustache.
Lori::: That's very sweet, Carl. But I think I can manage on my own.
Carl::: I understand. For the record, strong, independent women enflame the passion of my heart.
Lori::: Literally adorable. 
Carl:::  Thank you for ruining my vibe! 
Ronnie Anne:::  And there's a building, and another building, and, ooh, an even taller building. Whew, good tour.
Casey, Sameer and Nikki::: Hey, Ronnie Anne!
Lincoln::: Hey, those kids are calling you!
Sameer::: Hey, didn't you hear us?
Ronnie Anne::: Duh, obviously not.
Lincoln::: Hey, I'm Lincoln.  I'm sure Ronnie Anne's told you all about me.
Casey::: Actually... no. I'm Casey, that's Sameer, and that's Nikki.
Nikki::: 'Sup?  How do you know Santiago?
Ronnie Anne::: Uhh,  Linc's a part of my rough-and-tumble past.
Lincoln::: Ha! The only thing rough-and-tumble was that church carnival ride that made us puke up our cotton candy.
Ronnie Anne:::  We should get going.
Lincoln::: You guys want to hang with us?
Casey::: Heck yeah!
Sameer::: Sweet!
Nikki::: You bet!
Various People::: Out of my way! Watch it! You watch it!
Lori::: Hey! Excuse me! --Aah! 
Sameer:::  So what do you guys do for fun up on 300th street?
Lincoln:::  300th street? What are you--
Ronnie Anne::: Oops, my bad. Sorry, Linc. 
Lincoln::: Aah! These pigeons are crazy!
Casey:::  Aren't they just as crazy uptown?
Lincoln::: What do you mean? I'm not from--
Ronnie Anne::: Uhh, you looked hot.
Lori:::  Okay, two stops to 45th street.
Conductor::: This is an express train to 250th street.
Lori::: Wait, what?! 
Elevator Man::: Welcome to the top deck. Don't forget your complimentary souvenir photo on the way out.
Lincoln::: Oooh! This view is amazing! Our tallest building doesn't come close to this, but it does provide a great view of my friend Liam's chicken farm.
Nikki:::  I've never heard of a chicken farm in the city.
Lincoln::: I don't live in the c--
Ronnie Anne:::  Oh! Look! A blimp!  Ah, you missed it.
Lincoln::: Hey, Ronnie Anne, it's pretty cold up here.  Don't you wanna put your sweatshirt on?
Ronnie Anne::: No, I'm good.
Lincoln::: Then can I borrow it? I'm cold.
Ronnie Anne:::  No, you're good too.
Lincoln:::  Just let me borrow it.
Ronnie Anne:::  Hey, what's your problem?
Lincoln::: I know what's going on. You lied to your friends and told them you're from uptown instead of Royal Woods.
Ronnie Anne:::  What? That's ridiculous!
Lincoln::: I'm not dumb. Are you embarrassed about being from Royal Woods?
Ronnie Anne::: Just drop it, Lincoln.
Lincoln::: Well, you can do what you want, but I'm not lying about where I'm from.
Ronnie Anne::: Why do you have to mess everything up for me? I didn't ask you to come here in the first place.
Lincoln:::  You're right.  So maybe I'll just go! Right after I take my complimentary souvenir photo!
Lori::: Okay. I'm still a city girl. I can find my way-- baaaahhhhh!! 
Sergio::: 
Lincoln:::   Hey, everyone, I just remembered I need to go home. So I'm gonna... pack.
Bobby:::  Babe, are you okay?
Ronnie Anne:::  Where's Lincoln?
Maria::: He's packing. What's going on?
Ronnie Anne:::  I did something dumb.
Rosa:::  What happened out there today!?
CJ::: Must be pirates.
Hector:::  Come on, we need to get to the bottom of this!
Lori:::  I'm sorry, Boo Boo Bear, but there's just no way I can live in the city.
Bobby::: But what about our plans? We're suppose to go to college here together.
Lori::: That was before I fell in a manhole! 
Bobby::: Oh, Babe, when I first got here, I walked right into the back end of a police horse. Lucky for me, he hadn't eaten lunch yet.  Life isn't always easy here. But once you get the hang of it, it's really great and I know you're gonna love it. 
Lori:::  Thanks, Bobby. I feel a lot better.
Ronnie Anne::: Lincoln, you can't leave. I didn't mean what I said before.  I do want you here.
Lincoln:::  I just don't understand why you don't want your friends to know you're from Royal Woods.
Ronnie Anne::: I don't know. I guess I wanted them to think I was a city kid, so they'd wanna hang out with me.
Lincoln::: Well, if they're really your friends, they'll like you for who you are, not where you're from.
Ronnie Anne:::  Guess you're right.  Thanks, Lame-O. Come on,  we need a do-over of today.
Frida:::  Uh... Just doing our weekly door inspection. This one fails.
Lincoln::: Can we start with a re-do of my complimentary photo? It didn't come out great.
Ronnie Anne:::  Sure, but let me take care of something first.  Hey, can I talk to you guys? Um... I haven't been honest with you. I'm not from the city. I'm from a small town called Royal Woods. Both of us are.  I'm sorry I lied. I get it if you don't want hang out anymore.
Casey::: Of course we want to hang with you.
Sameer::: Yeah, we don't care. I mean, I'm from Kansas.
Nikki:::  Wait, what?  I'm just messing with you.
Casey::: Hey, let's get something to eat. I'm suddenly craving garlic knots.
Ronnie Anne:::  Oh, man. Let me see that photo one more time.
Lincoln::: Well, this one didn't come out much better.
Ronnie Anne:::  I guess you'll just have to come back and visit again. 
Lincoln::: Ow! 
Lori::: Thanks for the pep talk, Boo Boo Bear. I'm excited to be a city girl again.
Lori:::  Hey! That's my van!  Come back!
Bobby:::  Babe, watch out for horse butts!
