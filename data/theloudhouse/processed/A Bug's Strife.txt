Rita:::  Oh! Double check, make sure I have my key.  Oh.  Honey, you shouldn't be out here. Go back inside and get to bed.
Lynn Sr.::: I just wanted to see you guys off. I'll miss you while you're at Aunt Ruth's today. It's a ding-dang shame I'm going to miss the slideshow of her bus tour of the malls of the Midwest. 
Rita::: Aw. Gesundheit. It's OK. Aunt Ruth will totally understand.
Lola:::  It's not fair! Why does Daddy get to stay home?  Ugh. Question answered.
Rita::: Get lots of rest. We'll see you tonight.
Leni::: Bye, Dad.
Lynn::: Feel better, Pops.
Lynn Sr.::: Woo-hoo! I'm free!  Ah, nice try, but your judgmental stares won't work.  Awwwww, yes. A day of peace and quiet in this house is a rare thing, and I won't apologize for really, really wanting one.
Host::: Welcome to Operation: Dessert Storm. Today is all about waffles.
Lynn Sr.::: Oh, yay! My favorite W food! This is gonna be the perfect day!
Host::: And now we return for our next segment, For Whom the Bell-gian Waffle Tolls.
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, waffle puns. You gotta love 'em.
Host::: And now, viewers, we're gonna reveal the secret ingredient to our raspberry waffle recipe.  The secret ingredient is... this!
Lynn Sr.:::  Oh, I missed the secret ingredient to the raspberry waffles. Oh, come to think of it, it's probably just raspberries.  Sorry, guys, not on my perfect day.  You guys can chase each other all you want out here.  Ah, peace and quiet at last.  Huh?  Huh?  Is that a cricket?!  Not today.  Ah. There you are.  Eat liquid spray butter, punk.  Ow! Right on the tailbone!  Oh, it is on.  Ha!  Gotcha! 
Aunt Ruth::: And here's a bathroom stall from a mall in Indianapolis. This one had auto-flushing like the ones at a fancy steakhouse.
Lynn:::  Dad's so lucky to be home sleeping. Ugh.
Aunt Ruth::: Shh! Lynn, you're gonna miss the massage chairs at the mall at Walnut Grove!
Lynn Sr.::: Where are ya?  Aha!  Enjoy my size-11, you beast!  Time for a little rock and roll, huh?  How do you like that, huh?  Oh! Tailbone again!  Ha!  This. Ends. Now.  Oh no.  Ow! My hand!  Alright, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Time-out.  Time-in.  I gotcha!  OK, you quiet-ruining varmint, out you go.  This seems far enough.  Go ruin someone else's day. No one outmaneuvers Lynn Loud when peace and quiet are on the line.  Ah.  No, no. No! No! No!  Key. Key, key, key, key, key.  NO! Dang it!  Bad gloating animals!  Oh! Maybe I forgot to lock the front door when the fam left!  Curse me and my innate sense of responsibility.  Oh yeah! I gave Grouse a spare key. 
Mr. Grouse::: No one's home! Go away!
Lynn Sr.::: Mr. Grouse, I need your help!
Mr. Grouse:::  Oh, lookie, it's a Loud. Shocker. What do you want, and how fast can I get rid of you?
Lynn Sr.::: Remember the spare key I gave you for emergencies? Well, this is an emergency.
Mr. Grouse::: Oh, yeah, sure. I keep it in a bowl right here.  Yeah, this might take a minute.
Mr. Grouse::: It should be easy to find. You had it on that weird keychain. 
Lynn Sr.:::  I wove that myself.
Mr. Grouse::: Oh, wait. Now I remember where your key is.
Lynn Sr.::: Where?
Mr. Grouse::: Inside your house.
Lynn Sr.::: What?!
Mr. Grouse::: When you gave me that ding-dang thing I told ya I didn't want the responsibility. So one day when you were all out I used the key to let myself in and returned it.
Lynn Sr.::: Huh. Is that why there's missing Lynn-sagnas?
Mr. Grouse::: Well, yeah, that- that was my delivery fee. Can I go back to my nap now?  You might wanna catch a couple of Z's yourself. You look like a hot mess.
Lynn Sr.::: Ugh! Come on, Lynn, think. There has to be a way in.  Yes! That's the way in!  Heh-heh. Try to outsmart Lynn Loud? I don't think-  Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!  Woohoo! Those father-daughter pole vaulting lessons with LJ sure-  Cliff, don't you dare post that!  Stupid cricket! This is all your fault. Could be asleep right now.  I'm gonna make it!  Oh, I passed it!   Not the cactus!  The cactus would have been much better.  Oh, hey, . I can do it again.  Dang it.  Might've put on a few more pounds.  No more Mr. Nice Guy. On your mark, get set, CHAAAAAARRRRRGGEEEE!  At least I'm back in the house.  I still get a little relaxation time.  AAAAAHHHH!!!
Rita::: Oh, thank you guys for sitting through all 700 of Aunt Ruth's slides.
Leni:::  Are you kidding? I could look at malls all day. Do you think she'd show it to me again?
Lynn::: Leni!
Rita::: Kids, remember to be quiet when we get home. Your dad is sick, he's probably asleep-
Leni::: Did I leave my flat iron on?
Lisa:::  Did I leave my plutonium reactor on?
Lola::: Mama's coming, Mr. Sprinkles!
Rita:::  Lynn? Honey?
Lynn Sr.::: HA! Where is he?! Where is he?! Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
Rita::: What happened? Oh, honey, you must've been so delirious you trashed the house. I had no idea you were this sick. You need to get to bed immediately.  But not here.  Kids, come on. We have to go.
Lynn Sr.::: Ah! Move to Canada. Smart. Chirpy won't find us there. 
Rita::: No. We'll stay with Aunt Ruth until the house is repaired. She'll be happy to help nurse you back to health.  I should warn you, though, she'll want to show you her Malls of the Midwest slideshow.
Lynn Sr.::: Malls of the...  Roar of the beast. Are you kids making that chirping noise? Why would you mess with your old man like that?!
Lana::: It's not us, Dad. It's this little guy.  I found him in the house, and now he's my new pet. I named him Paul.
Lynn Sr.::: No! No! Don't name him!  AHHHH!!!!
