One-Eyed Jack:::  Well, Ace, we've narrowed down the suspects to...the Card Shark, Snake Eyes, and the Old Maid.  But which one made off with the golden die?
Ace Savvy:::  It's as clear as the mustache on your face, Jack. Only one of these villains could've done the deed. And that is...
Lincoln::: My money's on the Card Shark.
Clyde::: Same. The guy never blinks, you just can't trust him. OK, let's see. 
Lincoln::: Boom!
Clyde::: Nailed it! We just solved our fifth case in a row.  We're on a hot streak.
Lincoln:::  Hey, Leni. How was work?
Leni:::  Terrible!
Lincoln:::  What happened? I thought things were going great at the store.
Leni::: They were! Until this afternoon...
Leni::: Your receipt's in the bag, along with some samples of our new scent: Sugar Cookie Sunshine.
Leni::: That skirt would look great on you. And it also makes a cute poncho.
Woman:::  You just changed my life!
Ms. Carmichael:::  Uh, Leni?
Leni::: Hi, Mrs. Carmichael. How's the monthly inventory going?
Ms. Carmichael::: Not great. Several scarves have gone missing. Can you come with me?
Leni::: Are we going on a scavenger hunt?
Leni:::  There was no scavenger hunt, she thinks I stole the scarves!
Lincoln::: What? Why would she think that?
Leni::: They were all from my department, and they all went missing in the month that I've worked there, so she said she had to let me go. And I said, 'Go where?', and she said, 'That means you're fired!' 
Lincoln:::  That is so unfair. Leni would never steal anything.
Clyde::: This is worse than the time Crazy 8 was falsely accused of stacking the deck.  If only there was someone who could help clear Leni's name.
Lincoln:::  You mean like, us? 
Clyde::: Lincoln, I know we have these amazingly accurate uniforms, but we're just 11-year-old boys.
Lincoln::: 11-year-old boys who just solved their fifth case in a row. We're ready to deal out some justice! Clyde: Wow, you just sounded like Ace. If I had hair on my arms, it would be standing up.
Clyde:::  So cute for fall.  Jack to Ace, no suspects sighted by the mini-backpacks, over.
Lincoln:::  Copy. No suspects by the-  Whoa! 
Kid::: Cool costume! I'm playing superheroes, too. Wanna see my hideout? 
Lincoln::: Aah!  Actually, this isn’t a costume, it’s a uniform. And, I’m not 'playing', I’m investigating.  Where are your parents?
Kid:::  My mom's too busy to play, too.
Clyde::: Ace! Suspect spotted by the scarves. And, you won’t believe who it is.
Lincoln::: Sorry, kid. Gotta follow this lead. 
Lincoln::: Gabby? It can't be her. She lent me her safety goggles in gym.
Lincoln::: It's totally her. Come on!
Gabby::: Oh, I know I'm gonna get in trouble, but... 
Lincoln, Clyde, and Gabby's Mom::: Hold it right there! 
Gabby's Mom::: Gabby, you already have a closet full of scarves.
Gabby:::  Mom! Please, just let me buy it!  I have a gift card.
Gabby's Mom::: Your aunt gave you that for a sensible pair of shoes. Now put that scarf back.
Gabby:::  Clyde? Lincoln? What are you doing here?
Clyde:::  Oh, you know, just, shopping for some-
Gabby::: Training bras?
Fiona::: Ugh. Do you have any idea how hard these things are to put back on hangers?
Lincoln::: Uh, sorry. We'll clean it up.
Clyde:::  I'll just gather these, uh, items.  Ahh! My crime eye! 
Clyde::: Okay, so we'll be more careful next time.  No one's a suspect unless they're extremely suspicious.
Lincoln::: Like, say, a senior in the junior's department?  Scoots. We know she's done some hard time in mall jail.
Clyde::: Maybe she's just here to buy a gift for her parole officer.
Lincoln::: Then why is she going into the fitting room?
Clyde:::  You're right. She's probably going in there so she can stash the scarf in her bag.
Lincoln::: Let's get her!
Clyde:::  Wait! We just can't barge into a fitting room.
Lincoln::: Dang it, you're right. We need a way to stop her on the way out.  Ooh,-- I've got it! Clyde: Spike strip!
Lincoln::: Let's see her try to scoot over these.
Clyde::: Haha, yeah. They'll have to start calling her Stops.
Scoots::: Make way! Mama's late for a toga party!Lincoln: Uh oh! I think we messed up again.Clyde: Mrs. Stops, scoot! I mean, Mrs. Scoot, stop!
Scoots:::  Here's your twenty bucks, I don't need a receipt.
Scoots:::  My B! Put it on my tab!Fiona:  Seriously?! You two again?!Lincoln: Sorry!Clyde: We’ll clean this up.
Fiona::: Get out!
Lincoln::: Okay, so we're O for 2, but I'm sure Ace and Jack have made a few false accusations in their careers.
Clyde::: Totally. Remember that lawsuit they had to settle with The Bluffer?
Lincoln::: We just have to be more careful not to jump to conclusions.
Clyde:::  Right. And if we see someone walking quickly away from the store, clutching a bag with blue fabric sticking out of it.
Lincoln::: Exactly.  Wait, what?!
Lincoln & Clyde:::  Fiona!
Lincoln::: It makes perfect sense! That's why she threw us out of the store. She didn't want us on her trail.
Clyde:::  Come on, Ace! Let's go deal with this joker!
Lincoln:::  Wait! We need one more player at the table. 
Kid::: You're back!  And you brought your sidekick! 
Clyde:::  Uh, excuse me, we're partners. 
Kid::: Can we all play superheroes now? 
Lincoln::: Sorry, we can't. We're about to crack a case.
Kid:::  Aww...  
Lincoln::: There she is!  Ms. Carmichael, we can prove that Leni didn't steal those scarves.
Ms. Carmichael:::  Uh, who are you? 
Lincoln::: Clearly, we're detectives. 
Clyde:::  Here are five cases we've previously cracked. 
Lincoln:::  Please just come with us, there's not much time! 
Lincoln::: Stop right there Fiona! 
Clyde::: Open the trunk. 
Fiona::: What? Why? I-I'm not doing that. 
Ms. Carmichael::: I think you better. 
Fiona:::  Okay, you caught me. 
Lincoln::: Mrs. Carmichael, I think you'll find this bag contains at least one blue-- 
Lincoln & Clyde:::  Dress? Huh? 
Fiona::: Yep. I brought this at Stader's after my shift. Sorry, Mrs. C. I know we're not supposed to shop at our competitors, but it was such a good deal.
Ms. Carmichael::: Well, I can't say that I approve, bu--  Oh, wow, they are giving this away.  Do they have it in a 12? 
Lincoln:::  Uh, Fiona? We're really sorry for accusing you. 
Clyde::: These things sometimes happen in detective work. You're bound to play a few bad hands before you win the jackpot. 
Fiona::: Whatever. I'm leaving now.  
Lincoln::: Well, ma'am, we've made a mistake.  But don't worry, we're not giving up until we find the real shoplifter. 
Clyde::: It would really help if we could have access to your private employee files and customer mailing list. 
Ms. Carmichael:::  Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do for Leni, but I don't need two kids in costumes disrupting my store. Now please, just stay out.  
Lincoln:::  Give us another chance! Ace and Jack can't rest until they done found some justice! 
Lincoln::: I feel terrible, Clyde. We failed Leni, and now she'll never get her job back. 
Clyde::: I just don't know how we got it so wrong. Is it possible that reading comic books doesn't make you a good detective? 
Lincoln::: I guess it's possible.  Maybe we really are just two kids in costumes.  
Clyde::: You're right.  Ow. That wasn't a good idea. 
Leni:::  Oh. Hey, you guys. Don't mind me, I'm just looking for stuff to fold. I really miss it.  Oh, can I fold this? 
Lincoln::: You can have it. I'm done wearing capes. 
Leni::: Well, it doesn't have to be a cape. You could wear it as a scarf too.  
Lincoln:::  Wait, did you just say scarf? 
Leni:::  You're right. What was I thinking? Wrong season, Leni.  How about a beach cover up? 
Lincoln::: No, no, scarf!  Clyde, that's it! If a cape can be a scarf-- 
Clyde:::  --Then a scarf can be a cape! 
Lincoln::: I think I know who the culprit is. 
Clyde::: So do I.  
Lincoln::: Leni, can I have that back? We have a crime to solve. 
Leni::: At the beach? 
Lincoln::: Okay, let's split up. You look in the accessories section. I'll cover the shoes. 
Ms. Carmichael::: Ahem.  I thought I told you to stay out of my store. 
Clyde::: Don't worry, ma'am, we'll be gone in a minute. We just need to talk to your son. 
Ms. Carmichael:::  My son? 
Kid::: You're back! Your mustache is crooked. 
Lincoln::: Hey! Any chance you still want to play superheroes? 
Kid::: Yeah!  I'll show you my hideout! 
Ms. Carmichael::: Hideout? What hideout? 
Clyde::: I think we should all go see it. Especially you, Mrs. Carmichael. 
Ms. Carmichael::: Ugh, fine.  But if you boys are wasting my time again, I will have you banned from the mall until you're 18.
Clyde:::  No more fro-yo?
Lincoln:::  No more comic book store?
Clyde:::  You better be right, Lincoln. The stakes are high.
Kid::: So, here’s my hideout.  Wait, just let me put in the password.  Beep Boop Beep Boop. 
Ms. Carmichael:::  The scarves!
Kid::: Mom, they're superhero capes. 
Ms. Carmichael:::  Wow, I had it all wrong. Thank you, boys. 
Lincoln:::  No problem, ma'am. I guess you can say that justice was in the cards.  
Leni::: Cute top! And did you know that you can also wear it as a pencil skirt? 
Ms. Carmichael::: Oh, Leni. I can't apologize enough for accusing you of stealing those scarves. Is there any way I can make it up to you? 
Leni:::  Hmm... Are there any sweaters I can fold?  Hey, you guys! Thank you so much for getting my job back. I've been telling everyone at the mall what totes amazing detectives you are. 
Lincoln::: We know! We just got a new case at the pet store. 
Clyde::: A chameleon's gone missing.  They think, he's just really hard to see, so it's possible he's just in his cage. 
Leni::: Well, if there is anyone who can solve the case, it's Blake Saucy and One-Arm Joe. 
Lincoln:::  Eh, close enough.  Ready to deal out some justice?  
Fiona:::  Seriously?
